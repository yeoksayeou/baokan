<h3>籌募救災基金</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>長江水患纔吿一段落。而黃溜奔放之警報。又日日震盪於吾人之耳鼓。蓋莊口門以欵絀未堵。决瀉之水。到處成災。最近微湖水位突漲。中運危象日著。魯南蘇北一帶之人民。或胼手胝足于險工之搶護。或焦頭爛額于欵項之籌措。已罹災者。固不堪洪流之搏擊。未遭厄者。亦深懷其魚之恐怖如此艱苦之情形。久經搘拄而不紓。已為人世間一大痛心事矧未來之禍變。尙難測其所屆。翹首北望。誠有不勝其蹙蹙者矣。</p>
<p>中央對于救災之措置。近頃已有嚴切之運籌。如行政院通過之江河標本兼治辦法。為華洋工程人員悉心研討之結果。實施上宜無十分扞格之處。而財長孔祥熙復與經委會秘書長秦汾聯袂北上。視察災情。並擬與韓復榘李儀祉等面洽一切。其于導溜與賑災。必能兼籌而並顧。惟災區遼闊。工程浩穰。一經著手。動需巨欵。果無相當準備。仍難確收實效。觀于日昨中政會通過中央公務員助脤辦法。及孔案所列之江河治標經費。似當局已能從需要上謀實際之彌補。而非復如往昔空言炎炎可此。此于救災前途差可認為欣慰者也。</p>
<p>賑濟災區。民間團體早已著手進行。亦有成效可覩。祗以國民經濟衰替。輸將猶嫌不廣。至如治水工程。事關國家大計。宜于人民無與。特在國帑枯竭。如今日。政府縱有深謀遠算。唯恐中途又成畫餅。為整個救濟事業著想。正不妨與賑濟運動百為呼。廣廣事籌募。而統其稱為救災基金。俟有成數。再為支配。關于籌欵之道。各方不乏獻議。有主張政府撙節公共建築費以資撥充者。（見大公報）有主張于航空公路獎券項下挪用一部分者。（見獨立評論）有主張以每人一元為標準。而由各學校家庭機關團體分別實行者。（見學林西報）皆具獨到之見。宜予分別考慮。至中央公務員扣薪助賑辦法。原則上誠為吾人所樂聞。唯規定月俸在五十五元以上者扣捐一月薪額之半。此在中上級職員。原屬無所妨碍。若在六十元左右之小職員。藉令別無收益。使覺應付為難。故此項辦法。比例上之差率。雖不失其平衡。事實上之出入。要已相距甚遠。補救之道。謂宜由各機關之上級長官于規定比率之外。自動捐輸巨欽。以為表率。亦勸募賑欵必然應有之點綴也。</p>
<p>要之。募集救災基金。嘗視為目前唯一之急務。無論積極方面為治水之準備。消極方面對災民之振施。皆應全國上下羣策羣力以赴者也。誠以國內有此兩大流。造成一年一度之水災。非特田廬漂沒。人畜流亡。且使一切建設。盡歸停頓。此其貽禍。寧有紀極。與其積逐年之損害。曷如謀一勞而永逸。資異日之利。償今茲之失。于計亦正云得。至災黎孑遺。隨處充斥。幸免身膏魚吻。亦將流為餓莩。其木挺而走險危及治安者幾希。故救災運動。自其狹義言之。原寫一種同情之援助。若就廣義而觀。實有超乎同情以上者。吾人　察災情有舐糠及米之勢。郎本身難免逢棟折校崩之壓明。乎此。則今日對于救災輸助。正如手足之捍頭目。寧尙有遲迥審顧之餘地乎。</p>

<h3>國聯行政院會議　意保留行動自由　英促成和解唯力是視　法遵守盟約亦不後人</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）今日午後國聯行政院開會討論意阿爭案、意代表阿洛錫曾切實聲明意政府保留行動之完全自由、以便採行謀求其殖民地安全之必要計畫、此外演說者有英總代表艾登·法總理賴伐爾·阿代表吉齊敎授·及西班牙代表沃禮文、行政院今日開會兩次、未有决議、卽宣吿延會、下次開會日期未定、</p>
<p>艾登首起致詞、條舉巴黎三國會議中所提出之建議、繼以莊嚴之語氣、宣布英國將竭其能力、以促成和平解决、艾登續謂、英人嘗以種種方法試圖造成新的國際秩序、而使人類免受戰爭之荼毒、國聯盟約所制定之新秩序之機關乃在日內瓦、苟其精神尙存、則英人决不致遭遇失敗也、英政府深知彼為國聯會員國之責任、而世界輿論現方注視英政府之行動、國聯現遭遇關係其存亡之試騐、若不能安然渡此難關、則其勢力將大受損害、國聯之瓦解、新的國際秩序之紊亂將釀成世界之浩刦、英意兩國間毫無政治上或經濟上相衝突之問題、英國在阿之主要利益、曾由意國明白承認、英政府並未慮及此項利益將不復受人尊重、英國旣為國聯會員國、復為凱洛格非戰公約之簽字國、英國迄今所關心者唯此而已、故英國責當利用國聯機關、如能獲爭案雙方忠貞之合作、則不致不能吿成和平之解决也、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>賴代爾繼艾登宣稱、法國絕對遵守國聯盟約、過去努力和平之國、無有出於法國之右者、卽以去年之薩爾問問、與匈牙利與南斯拉夫之爭端而論、亦由法國與關係國誠意合作、始獲解决云、賴氏復涉及意國行將向國聯提出之文件、此項文件、將由國聯予以詳盡之討論最後宣稱、吾人今後均應遵守條約義務、蓋以吾人急需和平故也、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>至是阿洛錫提出長文、詳紀近五十年來意阿關係之歷史、謂意國恒以忍耐與公道對阿、而阿國因己亦為國聯會員國、遂圖規避一九二八年意阿條約、阿洛錫於是引述阿國種種「侵略行動」、謂意國不再信任阿政府、不能接受其所發之宣言、阿國若仍居國聯中、而與意國平等相處、則意國將覺負有重大之創痛、意政府保留行動之完全自由、以便採行謀求其殖民地安全之必要計畫、阿政府之作為、實不屑容其加入文明各國之林、阿政府並未實行其國聯盟約下擔任之義務、意國昔日投票容阿加入國聯、今殊抱憾、</p>
<p>阿洛錫致詞畢、會議乃中止、晚間繼續集議、阿代表吉齊敎授對會衆致詞、謂意阿仲裁調解委員會已開脫華爾華爾衝突案阿方之責任、阿政府切欲與意國吿成妥恊、頃間阿洛錫所責阿國之各端皆屬虛搆、稍緩阿國將提出論證以詳駁之、同時彼願請會眾注意一事、卽意國現圖提議申責在其主權範圍內行事之一國、而造成「國聯可怖的前例」是、</p>
<p>末由西班牙代表沃禮文致詞、以堅决之言詞擁護國聯盟約之原則、於是國聯行政院乃宣告延會、下次集議日期未定、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）意國出席國聯行政院代表阿洛西、頃向報界發表談話、批評本日午後行政院會議中各　代表之陳述、並擁護、大利所提出之備忘錄、就其語調、似表示歸火利已堅决準備行動惟仍未絕和解之途、阿洛西略、「意大利雖參加國聯會工作、然拒絕與阿比西尼亞計論一切、蓋阿比西尼亞乃吾人所認為非法亂紀者也、目前吾人不欲退出國聯會、大約國聯會行政院將指派特種委員會、研究意大利之備忘錄、然後决定採納或拒絕意國備忘錄之結論、總之、意大利並不要求開除阿比西尼亞、然國聯會對於意阿兩國、究竟應容納何國、則當由行政院自行選擇之」云、各報記者詢以意國政府究具何種意向、阿洛亞西答語頗為堅定、謂「目前不至立時發生危險、但如吾人遭對方挑釁、則又作別論、」但阿洛西又表示、如日內瓦談判進行一日、則和平解决之希望亦一日未絕、述及英國不管部大臣艾登之建議、則謂「艾登雖自信係寬大之建議、而吾人則視為未足、蓋此項建議與吾人之志願及犧牲之代價殊不相符也、意大利在巴黎三國會議中要求在阿國得佔政治經濟之優越地位、而英國之提議則僅能與吾人以經濟上之半優越地位、惟此種提議、究係談話之開端、抑係談判之終結、則為題問結之所在」云、最後阿洛亞西答記者問、謂意國簽　巴黎非戰公約時、曾提出保留、應將菲洲除外、故阿比西尼亞不愛非載公約之約束云、（四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>意政府　提交國聯文件　責阿政府四點</h3>

<p>（三）繼續不斷的傷害阿境意僑之生命財產、</p>
<p>（四）對意屬索瑪里倫作同樣之攻擊、備忘錄曾證明意國之好意、謂意國曾供給阿國來福槍四千枝、子彈一百萬發、第一批售價一百九十萬里爾、迄今阿王仍欠意國八十四萬五千里爾、國聯諸會員員對於違背條約義務而自處於條約以外之另一會員國、仍遵守國聯盟約條規而與相處、實屬違反正誼與公道之原則云、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>由開封赴為禍魯西蘇北黃河决口、同行有魯省黨委李文齋·魯西災民代表周百朋·經委會黃河防汛督察劉秉忠·黃河水利委員會王秘書等、分乘二汽車、先後於淸晨出北門、城防沙袋、堆砌整齊、越護城堤、道旁綠柳蓊茸、凉蔭覆人、田野微積雨水、尙無大害、行抵黃河大堤、折而東走堤道、堤寬約三丈、兩旁綠柳如幃、汽車宛轉迅行、絕少顚簸、堤北河灘、堤南平地、均種粱菽、已黃熟如雲、河流尙距堤數里、且作物穗葉繁密、故長行百數十里、猶未得瞻滾滾奔放之河溜、惟灘地高於平地、恒在二丈左右、灘地日漸淤高、平地益　低窪、其為前途之險象不待智者已可决也、茲後苟不於上游各省區、實際廣種森林、以調節氣候雨量、而制减河含泥沙、徒知加高堤防、空言疏濬、則河汛之無寧日、適如其本身之無淸時也必矣、</p>
<p>車抵豫東邊地之考城縣、堤道難走、繞行平地、記者與李周二君、共乘先行之車、司機不諳路徑、迨入魯境曹縣、始悉誤駛歧途、欲踅尋王秘書等之車轍、又嫌紆週甚遠、且汽油將罄、深恐半途拋錨、李固曹縣人、以餘油計程、决先抵荷澤（曹州）購汕、後又轉赴董莊口門、衆同意而行、道路多在田野問、曲折狹小、僅便人走、不利車行、彌望可紗帳、致方位莫辨、逢人便高呼「二哥」、請詢去向、然猶誤途數次、而深陷車輪於泥灘、此間普通稱呼、俗以「二哥」為敬、若以「大哥」呼人則被認為有意侮辱、弱者將賜以白眼、强者更惡言反駡矣、蓋呼大哥、似侮其人有為武大之嫌疑、故怫然大怒、若稱二哥、如敬其人具有武松之義氣、故色然以喜、南人旅行北地、若不慣以二哥稱人、隱以　老大」自居、則最好稱人以「老鄉」、此乃冀（實仍稱直）魯·豫·三省最普通之稱謂也、</p>

<p>荷澤縣長及科長等、多係李委員之舊知、承留便餐後、並派一警為嚮導、繼續出發、西北行二十餘里、地名新莊、距口門尙有四十里、日已偏西、秋風送爽、正好加快車速、趕赴目的地時、詎車忽為泥灘所困、或請人推、或雇牛挽、出一灘又陷一灘、最後電力使用過度、機件猛然滋火、將電表燒壞、無法修用、乃以牛將車拖回菏城、記者等仍步行前進、六里抵何家莊、天色漸黑、邂逅李委員中學時代之敎師何先生、切瓜烹茶、殷勤招待、藉悉該莊人稠地少、曩日地價昂貴、上田每畝售至百數十元、現因農村經濟破產、無資耕種、地價慘跌四十元左右、猶有難於穩定之勢、地價漲落、原不足怪、惟以山東安靖之區、良田美地、竟至無資耕種、而有荒蕪之虞、此不特非現社會一意孤行之佳兆、且直為現社會弱點自然暴露之序幕、蓋不得等閒視之也、</p>
<p>夜凉辭何先生登程、同行四人、（李委員帶一隨行）各分乘小車一輛、轆轆魚貫前進、山東小車、輪小而藏於載物板下、一人負繩導引於前、一人肩帶力推於後、乘客仰臥載物板上、尙無偏坐之勞、但黑夜摸索、溝河縱橫、往往不能繞越、則四人共推一車、涉水而過、水深沒膝、時有游魚撞足料為潰决之流無疑、所謂黑夜臨深淵誠不勝肉顫心悸、下一小坡、李委</p>

<h3>中國水災的原因和預防　國府賑務委員會顧問貝克講</h3>
<p>— 蔭良譯述</p>
<p>華洋義賑會曾經統計中國的天災、在最近二千年中、有一千八百次以上、成災的原因是水旱和疫癘、大抵十年之內、總有九年受災、而其原因、十分之八是大水、</p>
<p>水災和旱災都是國家的大患、而水災的損害較旱災還大、民國十一年的天津附近水災損失、約有三萬萬元、民國二十年的長江大水災、損失了二十萬萬元、今年水災的損失雖然還沒有統計、想來總是不小、我們敢說兩三次的水災損失、一定可以抵得過全部中國的國債、</p>
<p>中國水災的原因大約有三種關係</p>
<p>（一）天氣關係　中國的氣候兩量跟太平洋的風、有很大的關係、大家知道、太平洋夏季季候風、從太平洋面漸漸吹到中國北部、從這季候風裏帶來了不少水份、假如這含有的水份慢慢地降落下來、那末中國的北部、一定是「風調雨順五榖豐登」、假如這含有的水份、在十天或兩星期內、迅速地降落下來、那末這極大的雨量、一定成為水災、但是反過來說、這季候風不來、或僅吹到一部份地方、那末結果一定是成功全部或一部的旱災、這是天氣的關係、</p>
<p>（二）地理關係　河道的容量、與水災有極大的關係、長江及其支流、約有二百萬平方基羅密達、民國二十年大水災的時候、長江水流的速率、每秒鐘是八十五萬立方密達、但是長江的容量、僅僅每秒鐘六萬七千立方密達、長江的水不能立即入海、勢必上漲、上漲的結果、自然是潰決、所以在民國二十年的時候、堤防雖然沖破了、可是水勢還是每天上漲、這是地理的關係、</p>
<p>（三）土壤關係　中國長江黃河上流、大都是淤泥、淤泥最容易被水沖散、黃河的水常常含有百分之四十的泥土、而從長江每日注入海中的泥土約有一百二十五萬噸、這大量的淤泥、有時在中流沉澱下來、可以加高河底、減少河身的容量、有時在一處淤塞起來、可以使上流的水不能暢流、而致泛濫、這是土壤的關係、</p>
<p>此外中國的江河沿岸很少種樹、因之雨量多的時候、不能儲藏、水流急的時候、又不能阻止、於是每有水災、總是一發不可收拾的了、</p>
<p>預防水災的方法極多、有人主張開浚河道、增加容量、這固然是一個治本的方法、但是他卻沒有想到這工程的浩大、有人計劃過這工程、把長江從宜昌起到海岸挖三英尺、要用最大的挖泥機三百二十七架、費用需三萬萬元左右、這一宗大欵子、一時自然無處設法、即使設法籌劃、進行工作、而上流的淤泥不清、仍就可以把河底填高、所以開浚的工作、只能在某一部份加以帮助、如果要全部開浚、現在是不可能的、</p>
<p>有人主張開浚湖澤、增加蓄水量、這也是一個治本的方法、長江的洞庭湖·鄱陽湖·太湖·微山湖·都是很好的蓄水池、但是他現在的容量、已比二千年或五百年前小得多了、其原因有二、第一是洪水淤泥的沈澱、使湖底加高、第二是居民與水爭地、使湖面窄小、所以沒有把淤泥想到方法以前、開浚湖澤的工作、是用力多而得益少的、</p>
<p>有人主張種樹、阻止水流、這自然也是一個好方法、但是中國的長江黃河上流、較海岸要高出四五千尺、如果江河沿岸統統種起樹來、種樹的區域、一定極大、種樹的經費、一定很多、養樹的工作、一定更繁重、目下自然無從設法、可是種樹是極好防水方法、中國政府、應當在可能範圍內漸漸進行、</p>
<p>據我的經驗和這次視察、江河災區的結果看來、中國救災的主要方法、還是堤防、這次長江的大水、要是沒有二十一年所築的堤防、要是沒有軍民的搶險、漢口是決不能倖免的、反之、黃河方面、因為事前沒有注意堤防、事後不能立即搶險、河水潰決後、自然只有忍着吃苦了、這次山東方面的水災、據最近的報告、水淹的地方有二千方里、全部損失至少在六千萬以上、假如事前能够築堤、事後立即搶險、所費不過是數十萬、這是一件多麼不經濟的事啊、</p>
<p>我所主張的堤防、應該完全利用科學方法、使他堅固不破、沿岸的交通網、如電話電報站、應盡量增加、一有變故、各處均可預防、我知道二年前的黃河沿岸、不過有二個視察報告站、現在還只有十九個站、這是不够應用的、</p>
<p>我所主張的搶險、應該利用軍事方法、軍民合作、搶險是一件苦事、做搶險工作的人、應該有一定期間、過了這期間以後、應該讓他們休息、另派別人來代替、工作時間的飲食、應該豐富、地方長官、應該以身作則、像這次漢口的搶險工作、是值得欽佩的、</p>
<p>我希望中國的政府和國民、今後要盡力築堤和護堤、出險的時候、應當用全副力量去搶險、同時對於開浚河道·開浚湖澤·和種樹、這三件工作、應該由專家設計、漸漸籌欵進行、循序而進、中國的水患、一定可以免除的、</p>

<h3>小男兒（卅七）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>他想別人是不會發覺的，可是韜廢曾經見過他，等到愛彌一兩天以後說起這個事，韜摩說了出來，恰巧為裴先生所聽見了。其時功課已畢，他們都立在廊裹，裴先生剛坐在一個　桿做的長椅子裹和坦第嬉耍：但是等他聽見了韜摩所說的話，又看見乃德臉漲得通紅，以一種驚懼之色看着他，他就把那個小孩子放下，說道，「到你母親那邊去，小乖乖，我就會來的，」於是牽了乃德的手，引他往教室裏去，並且把門關上。</p>
<p>童子們相顧嘿然：半嚮後韜摩才溜了出去，他從一個半掩的白葉窗裹望進去，看見一種使人馭詫的景象。裴先生剛取下高掛在書桌相近的一根扑杖，因為很少用到，已是滿着塵灰了。</p>
<p>「呀，不得了！這一次乃德要吃生活了。我還是不說的好，」害有同情的韜摩自己想道，因為被扑打是這個學校裏最大的恥辱。</p>
<p>「你紀得我上次對你講的話嗎？」裴先生對她說道，若不勝其憂戚而略無怒色。</p>
<p>「是的；但是請你不要叫我做，我不能忍受這個的，」乃德呌道，他反背了兩手直退到了門口，滿而都是憂容。</p>
<p>「為什麼他不挺身起來，像好漢一般去受了算吧？我倒會的」韜摩想道，雖然他看見了這般情狀，心裹也是別跳的。</p>
<p>「我須守我的前言，你須記得說真話。乃德，遵從我的話：拿起這個來重打我六記。」</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （黃連）</p>
<p>什麽是命？什麽是運？</p>
<p>現在有一部分抑鬱不得志的人，開口說命運！閉口說命運！一個很有作為的人，非但不能把命運兩個字推翻，反而給命運支配着。</p>
<p>也有人說：「命運兩字，可作為機會解釋，因為能處處逢到機會的人，這人也就是有著好的命運！」</p>
<p>大月氏拿破崙吧？他曾經對它的部下說：「什麽機會？我來創製機會！」可見機會兩個字，只要我們有堅毅的精神和努力，可由每個人自己創造出來！</p>
<p>「命！」「運！」不知費去了幾許光陰，誤却無數蒼生！</p>
<p>醒來吧！迷信「名！」「運！」的人們！我們不要給「命運」做著俘虜吧！</p>
<h3>談談心</h3>
<p>— 佩瑜</p>
<p>人類的心，確是一伴奇異的東西。一個人活着的時候，他的心永遠別別別別地跳動。以普通情形而論，心臟跳動的速率，差異很大，大概是每分鐘自四十五跳至一百八十跳的速率。每天它跳十萬次，每小時有五百四十磅重量的血液，在它這裏流過。假使有一個人，是做十分用力的工作者，例如推重載貨車的苦力，或是參加划舟比賽的划手，那麽一分鐘至少有八十加倫（量名）的血液，從他的心裏流入流出。</p>
<p>有一位科學家曾經精密地計算，血液在我們身體的血管內，所經過的路程。得到的結果是這樣：每一小時它行七英里，一天行一百六十八英里，一年行六萬一千三百二十英里。假使一位八十歲的老者，從小在他的血管裏有一個血球，隨血液浮來浮去，那麽計算它所浮過的路程里數，實足驚人，因為依照上面的算法算起來，差不多它要經過五百萬英里的旅程了。</p>
<p>人類的心，只不過是一塊中空的筋肉，式樣是圓錐形的，位於兩肺之間。普通的心，大小是五英寸長，二英寸半厚，在最廣闊的一部是三英寸半。男子的心重十英兩至十二英兩，女子的心重八英兩至十英兩。</p>
<p>生命開始的兩年甲，心生長得最最快，兩歲年紀的小孩的心，比新誕生的嬰兒的心要大兩倍。兩歲和七歲之間，心再大一倍。嗣後逐漸地生長，到了十五歲的時候，它已生長到在實用上合度的大小了。但是到了五十歲，它又要繼續地增大，雖則生長率是很慢的。</p>
<h3>悼張春帆先生</h3>
<p>— 金俊仁</p>
<p>據友人函吿，漱六山房主人張春帆先生，已因病身故，小說前董，又弱一個，滋可歎也。鄙人不學無文，年來得以文字，在滬上報章雜誌，與世人相見者，初實先生汲引之力，今聞其歿，悲感五內，爰述數言，用志哀悼。</p>
<p>民十八年，余居天津，先生在滬，獨辦平報三日刊，其表弟錢鴛湖，面托推銷，幷先修函為彼此介紹，因得締為神交。翌年三月，因事過滬，遂與先生面，其體魁梧，岸然道貌。越二月，事畢返津，複與相見。先生堅邀翌日叙於五芳齋，幷言當命人至逆旅相請，翌日晨起，使者未至，因踽步四馬路漢口路一帶，比歸逆旅，而囊中皮筴已失，內貯川資數十元，後為先生述之，乃慨然出金相假，數雖弗足，然其輕財仗義之心，固已難得矣。</p>
<p>余與先生相見，約四五次，其間經過，頗有足述者。一日言及諸家文字，先生興致勃發，娓娓不絕，已忽向余曰：君之文字，當在何等之開？余頳然莫能對。先生曰：是奚須客氣？言時申紙握筆，橫畫三畫，又於三畫之間，寫上中下三字。余　筆疑思，乃書中下之間四字。先生羅然喜曰：君尙有自知之明，似此寗有止境？</p>
<p>先生好飲，每飲必與飯顆同進，以飯下酒，亦其特嗜，九尾龜一書，為先生少年時所作，章秋谷卽先生之本身，每與余言及此，輒自責荒唐，夫人佩娟，卽書中之陳文娟，婉嫕持重，亦如所述。嗟乎　余自二十一年五月，與先生一別，晨思冥想，猶冀重有見期。詎料斯願未達，而死生已判，而今而後，永不復得見先生，緬念前情，痛何能已！</p>
<p>孩子們：爸校裡快開學啦！</p>
<p>失業的爸：唔，可是……</p>
<h3>蟋蟀的故事</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>因為白天的時間不够分配，我的看報工作大都改到晚間睡在床上做的。這幾天報紙帶給我的消息似乎不在「好」的方面！看了幾個標題就覺得頭痛。庭院中這裏那裏有許多蟋蟀在叫，於是我的精神就轉移到蟋蟀身上，因此我又想起關於它們的故事。</p>
<p>兒時喜歡到處翻磚挖泥捉蟋蟀，從到了就想和旁人的鬬，有次我那隻比對方大出二分之一的蟋蟀竟給鬬敗了，四週觀戰的小朋友都說我的蟋蟀不中用！怎麽大的倒給小的鬬　了！我含着羞恨回家去就把它摔死在地上餵螞蟻，氣得晚上沒有想吃飯。那年交過白露節令我跟着左鄰長脚伯伯帶了他的紅頭蟋蟀到「秋興局」去賭輪贏，對方是隻黑頭的，有位像是評判員那樣的人細心地秤過雙方蟋蟀的電量，講定了賭幾枝「花」，然後放兩隻蟋蟀到「閘盆」中去，决鬥是宣吿開始了！長脚伯伯那隻紅頭蟋蟀的聲勢甚大，張牙振翅很有一口就想咬死那隻黑頭蟋蟀的氣概，對方似乎見着它怕，掉尾向後退，它當然就追，黑頭的掉轉身來似乎想鬥但仍向後退，退，從盆的中央直退到底邊！長脚怕伯正要宣吿他的蟋蟀已得勝利，突然間，我們看到盆巾起了一陣劇烈的跳盪，我們看到兩隻蟋蟀象牙色的肚皮在翻來覆去扭作一團，四週觀衆的眼睛閃動着　駭而緊張的波光！突地我們聽到「撲」的一響，有隻蟋蟀被摔到盆外，盆中那隻黑頭的張牙振述四處搜索着對方還想鬥！它得意地叫了！長脚伯伯眞倒霉！輸了錢不算，還帶着「氣」回去！</p>
<p>這叫做「大勇若怯」！不過，必得要有了「大勇」然後「若怯」才有意義，才有價值，我們要忽略那隻黑頭蟋蟀的「若怯」，而重視它的「大勇」！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十八回　戚黨高攀逢迎斥小吏　雌威大作嘈雜惱夫人</p>
<p>這不用細猜，知道這是朱月英在哭。自己求藍專員不着，求賈多才的時候還多着呢，可就不敢冒昧的衝了進去。站了一站，聽裏面並沒有第二個人作聲，始終是朱月英細細的聲音哭着。心想賈多才好耐心，憑他這樣的哭，他竟是蚊子大的聲音也沒有。見有個茶房過去，就向賈多才屋子裏指指，望了那茶房。他搖了兩搖頭，微笑道：賈先生不在家呢。介夫這才問道：賈太太，你怎麽了？我可以進來嗎？月英在裏面帶了哭音道，房門是由外面鎖着的。介夫道：這也算不了什麽。你若是想出來，叫茶房給你開門就是了。月英道：茶房不敢開門的，我也不是要開門，我聽說我娘病了，我想回去看看，賈老爺不讓我去，說着，裏面的哭聲，突然的加重，說話聲音頓住，張介夫道：你不用哭了。回頭賈先生回來了，看到你哭紅了兩隻眼睛，一定是不高興的。月央　沒有答復，依然哭着。這時，却聽到樓上一片大聲，叫着茶房。又有人道：是叫樓下去個茶房，樓上藍專員屋子裏有話問。這個在和介夫答話的茶房叫馬三，却是小西天全旅館裏面，一個最有心計的茶房（三〇九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>在早上，只要伊老人家一走下床來，便有一個太監曾捧着一孟特地熬就的脂油，恭恭敬敬地走近伊面前去，這些脂油却和人家用在飲食裏面的不同，比較稀薄一些，中間也有花露攙和着，所以是很香的；太后就用自己的手指在那孟內輕輕地挑起了幾許來，塗在掌上，讓它漸漸溶化了，才塗到臉上去，簡直是滿臉全塗到，但伊並不胡亂的塗抹，總是非常小心的從事着。</p>
<p>這一種脂汕塗上去的意思是要消除昨晚所塗的那一重花液，所以必須滿臉全塗到，而且還得靜靜地坐上十數分鐘，才用一方最柔軟的毛巾把油一起抹掉，接下去便是敷粉和塗胭脂了。這一套手續是永遠不會變更的，像學校裏規定的課程一樣</p>
<p>伊的一雙手一般也是要用脂油塗抹過的，可是這一部份的工作伊却懶於自己從事，總得要我們這些當女官的給伊代勞；我們先是也挑起了一塊油擱在我們的手掌裏使它溶化，然後再用着一百廿分的小心抹到太后的手上去。太后的一雙手眞可說是很奇怪的，不僅白膩，而且是極柔嫩，决不在我們年輕人之下。我們給伊塗遍了脂油之後，隔了一會，還得替伊抹去：這一步的工夫可眞費事了，原來太后有一個很古怪的脾氣，不許我們用毛巾給伊擦抹，必須我們用毛巾輕輕地給伊拍着，一直拍得又乾又凈才止。（四〇九）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>醬</h3>
<p>— 祝融氏</p>
<p>醬是一種家庭間的調味食品，應用在菜肴重者甚多，世人外在開門七件事，柴米油鹽等之一，可見是重要的調味品。</p>
<p>醬的種類，有豆瓣醬，甜蜜醬的分別，市上醬園之中，都有出售，豆瓣醬是用黃豆瓣所製，味鹹，甜蜜醬　是由蠶豆和了　粉製成，味稍甜，所有的分別是在原料的不同，製法的各異而已。但是市上各醬園，所出售的醬，大都不甚乾凈，味道也劣，而且到了夏令，受着蠅蚋的啜集，有的竟發生了蛆虫等不潔的虫類，在衛生方面，絕對的不相宜，所以家庭間日用的醬，非自製不可，旣潔凈淸爽，又滋味鮮腴，比了市上出售的醬，其佳妙真有天壤之別了。</p>
<p>家庭間所製的醬，都是蠶豆的甜醬，下醬的時候，又必須在夏令二伏之內，方能久置不壞，所謂伏醬，就是山上出售的豆醬，甜醬，也都以伏醬為號召的。</p>
<p>製醬的法子，先在霉令之時，取乾蠶豆浸在水中，曝以日光，使豆皮發胖，取出剝去其皮，煮成豆糊，和入　粉　和，川力和成　塊，大約豆一升，和　兩斤，　塊已成，即揑為長條，入蒸範蒸熟，取出切成牌大的小塊，便是醬黃，放在竹製的籃中，或是籐製的笆斗之內，置在陰濕的地方，使其發酵，過了幾天，醬黃上便透出霉點，有一種餿的味道，這便是發酵的現象，再過了上多天工夫，發酵已透，便曝以强烈的日光，醬黃即漸漸的曬乾，醬黃也成了　黃的顏色，這時醬黃已經成功了。到了六月間的伏天，就是下醬的日期，用醬缸一只，須上口大而下底小的瓦缸，因便於曝曬。下醬之日，把醬黃稱得重量，大約一斤醬黃，用鹽二兩半或四兩，泡了鹽水，等鹽水冷透，將醬黃放入缸內，注入鹽水，以浸過醬黃為度，從此以後，將醬缸放在庭院中可以曬到日光的所在，每天用日光曬之，三天之後，醬黃漸漸溶化，便可以把醬黃掏條，使和在鹽水之中，再日漸曝曬，每曬一天，醬的面上一層，便發出了紅的顏色，這時每天的早上，日光尙未曬到，醬却因過了一夜而冷了。可以用醬爬掏和，使面上紅的一層，同下面的絞和，這般的經過了一個目光景，因日光的曝曬。醬的顏色，便漸漸的由黃而紅，由紅而紫，便成了美味的甜醬了。在曬醬的時候，因怕雨水的沖入，缸上須有一個不透水的缸蓋，白天開了受日光的曬曝，晚間便可以把蓋蓋好，防雨露的侵入，又為了蠅蚋的纏繞，致生了虫蛆，須備着一個紗罩，罩在缸上，如此所製的醬，可以保等淸潔了。醬製成之後，可以放在小口的瓦　之內，緊封　口，要用的時候，開封取出應川的數量，再封好　口，如此則雖久藏不壞，可以常年應用，不致有腐敗之處，倘是在裝　之後，可以常曬日光，尤可保藏長久，醬的滋味，雖經了一二年的時光，也沒有變動的一天啊！</p>

<h3>絲茶　洋莊茶市一蹶不振</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、愈趨沉靜、英法各莊杭家、均以近來國外認價緊縮、匯率逐步提高、非急需不願搜買囤積、故交易異常寥解、昨日全市僅祇同孚保昌怡和美星錦隆等行、買進珍眉蝦目貢熙鳳眉等項共計二百餘箱、市盤一致趨跌、市面至為悲觀云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　黑瓜子步漲不己</h3>
<p>黑瓜子近以到貨不多、地價步緊、兼之本街做瓜子大王之價吃來、及福　籌備公司吃胃　　、人批收進、因中國開價亦逐步　漲、昨市　　口子八十包、開十四元二角、明光了一百五十二　，九元四角、比之上月下句大粒漲起一元、小粒亦近一元聞徐魁了陳貨亦呌十四元、比　　時須差五元之譜、其勢尙　再升、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論舊劇之不能改良</h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>我不知道梅蘭芳所說起的俄人稱贊的舊劇三優點，究不知有何根據。蘇俄戲劇界，斯達尼斯拉夫斯基，梅葉荷特等諸大家都在，决無人作此妄語，或者至多不過為國際間一種酬離納詞令而已。所謂中國戲二名詞，即不能成立。我國昔日戲劇，門煌至繁，而皮黃最劣下，實為崑的微劇梆子等墮落後的一種殘餘物。要以皮黃所演代表中國戲，未免僭妄。所舉第一點：包含有歌唱，道白，舞蹈，武技，為綜合各種技術之混合　術一混合藝術一名詞，用來至為可笑。並且皮黃並無舞蹈，唱時不動，做時不唱：偶有載歡載舞的處所，都是襲員曲遺規。歌劇話劇，各有體裁，亦决不能認為優點。</p>
<p>第二：中國舞台器具及色　運川，最合於舞台經濟的原則，而不失其美麗。一皮黃並無舞台裝置（崑曲亦然）。如其可能，則儘量模仿貫物；如不可能，則儘量簡略；而淸朝宮庭劇及內地草台班為兩端的代表。只舊戲服裝，自具規模，為中心要素之一（見後），但全不知講究色彩的配合。歐洲古代的戲劇，情形與此相同。莎七比亞時代，即係中性或全無作用的背景，及絢爛的服裝。但人家早已絕塵奔逸了。</p>
<p>第三：一中國戲演員之一舉一動，皆有固定的方式，在各個劇本中皆可運用自如。而演員之表演天才，並不為固定的方式所束縛。」舊劇動作的程式化，為提倡舊劇的人最所自誇的一點，並詡為象徵。殊不知舊劇所有簡單的動作，旣非台理的基本形式，更非象徵，只是低級的寫實退化後所剩餘的殘餘物而已。如揮鞭代馬，旣不足以表達　馬的情緒，亦不足以顯示騎馬的思想。不過在窮於模仿以後，取最容易的方法暫代，並參以兒童式的妄信（如小兒土　　羹的筵宴）。如若可能，他們立刻走到模倣實物的地位去了。眞刀眞槍，真　上台，豈不永遠是戲院的號召物嗎？</p>
<p>但如何謂舊劇决不能改良呢？因為舊劇的中心要素為音樂及服裝兩項。劇本不佔重要地位。動作因服裝而轉移。舞台裝置則本無其物，現在勉强加進去，一變為機關佈景。故昔樂服裝如不能改良，則舊削其他部份縱然改變，亦無多影響。音樂服裝如能改良，則又將截然是另外一事，决不是現在的舊劇了。</p>
<p>我國戲劇隨音樂轉移，這是已經闡明的事，無待贅論。皮黃起於民間，為毫無音樂素養的人所創始，故音調最簡單，所用樂器又最劣下。皮黃主樂胡琴，在我國器樂裏並沒有什麽　位。然而就是這種簡單陋劣的音樂，也無人能够改良（余先生論國劇運動時已自認），也不願改革。故　　决無改良之可能。</p>
<p>至於改革劇本，則三十年來屢有人實行並沒有得到什麽效果。最早如汪　，劉藝舟等等，有文藝素養而獨創新劇本的如十多年前的歐陽予倩先生，支持最久而範圍較大的如陜西的易俗社，以名流學者相號召的如趙太侔余上沅諸先生，完全是一種宣傳的企圖的如江西努力劇團，其他新編削本，隨時多有！但效力在那裏呢？舊　仍屹然未動，不失其本來而月。所以談改革舊劇而目光只及於劇本，實太浮淺。至於說舊劇是封建思想的殘餘，是　淫誨盜等話，都不必再談，因為不足以服　倡舊劇者之心，只是他們確無法改革而巳。</p>
<p>舞台裝置也不能改革。舊劇只需要中性的背景。一幅繡花的松鶴或海日圖也可以，出將入相及其他匾額也可以，什麽都沒有也可以。機關佈景决不足以增加舊劇的價值，當為提倡舊劇者所公認。</p>
<p>動作也不能够改革。說到劇本取材底廣泛，音調底繁複，動作底優美，皮黃遠不如崑曲。旣為歌則不舞的原則所限制（這實在是一種未曾進化的原始狀態，因為我國戲劇原由僅只有唱的套數，連廂，及類似彈詞的弦索西廂等進化而來，故稍進一步之後，歌舞仍不相道繫，）故動作所能活動的節圍便已有限。加之動作隨服裝而轉移；舊劇的動作全為舊劇的服裝所决定，非先改革服裝則談不到改革動作。</p>
<p>而誰能够改革舊劇的服裝呢？各種舊戲，以音調相差最遠，服裝相去最近，故服裝實最為固定而不易變動。</p>
<p>綜上所說，皮黃實無改良的希望；假如要有，則也只有待到未來的音樂家，到那時或將有一種新的歌劇，但必須先有音樂家，在創立我國的音樂之後。</p>

<h3>蹺蹺板（五）</h3>
<p>— 白塵</p>
<p>小和尚看得出神，拔腿就跑。同頭喊一聲妹妹：「來！這塊！」</p>
<p>跑過白粉牆，果然有個小門。伸頭一張，「乖乖！」裏面有那末多的人！都部跟那猴兒一樣，不穿衣裳不穿褲子，有的頭上戴頂尖帽子，更像玩把戲的猴兒！</p>
<p>球兒向東，　　們搶上東；球兒滾上西，猴兒們也跑到西。擠做一團，滾做一團，比把戲好玩！</p>
<p>小和尙正看得出神，挨小毛頭一推：「那塊！」順着她的手看去，北邊還有一個門，門前圍了七八個跟他倆差不多大小的孩子，正伸長了鵓子向裏瞧，大家定住眼，張開嘴，一聲不響：忽然又一轟聲地笑了。</p>
<p>「咦」了一聲，兩個擠到人檔裏。這兒是一扇欄柵門，看得見走不進。小和尙把臉貼到欄柵上。嘿，瞧吧！……</p>
<p>這兒不是那些猴子啦！盡是張自己一般大的孩子們。東邊一簇人，西邊一簇人。踢球，跳繩，……什麽都有。——哦，那邊墻根下是什麽？高高一個架子，孩子們從那邊梯子爬上去，從這邊板上滑下來。「嚇！……」下來一個，「嚇！……」又是一個。一到地，小和尙的心就一突，小毛頭也一樣。還有一個孩子眞怪，倒過頭朝下溜，「嚇！……」頭將到地，一翻身便站在地上。</p>
<p>「啊！……」幾個孩子在柵欄外邊笑了。</p>
<p>瞧，這一邊牆根下又是什麽？——一個架子上放塊長的木板，有一兩丈，木板上一頭坐一個孩子，這僩上去，那個下來，那個上去，這個又下來。啊，一蹺就蹺得那末高！上頭一個在呌，下頭一個便在笑。小毛頭和小和尙的心上也就一陣一陣跳。人家　上去，他們身子也一鬆，肚子也一挺；人家落下來，他們的屁股也一沉，腰也一軟。</p>
<p>哥哥！……小毛頭眼望着哥哥，有一肚子話說不出。</p>
<p>小和尙也回頭找媽媽，媽媽正好走過來。</p>
<p>「媽！……」小和尙要說話。</p>
<p>媽媽說；「走吧，快到了！」</p>
<p>兩個都不想走，拖着媽媽也去看。小和尙說：『好玩哩，媽！」</p>
<p>媽媽伸頭看一眼。「噢！眞好！多少孩子！」</p>
<p>「媽！」小毛頭揚起頭來。</p>
<p>「唔？」</p>
<p>「進去玩。……」低低的聲。</p>
<h3>別</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>這日子太　過了；雖還只歸開我兩天，但教覺得　兩年的歲日還要悠長！</p>
<p>我分析不出我的感情，近來為什麽這樣脆弱，動不動總要流淚。但有時我又佩服自己有比銷鐵還强的理智，牠當當壓住了烈火一般的情　，使我　着冷靜演　的生活，不過自從昨天早晨六點鐘一直到現在，我都在情感中生活；完全失掉了理智。我並沒有流淚，真的，我望着車子開了，他揚着帽子，我抓着手，頃刻　車的影子消逝了，只聽得一聲聲急促的喇叭呌着，雖然淚絲遮住了我的視綫，但我像瞎子一般閉住眼睛走進了城門，　壓着的淚始終沒有流出一顆。</p>
<p>眞的，兩天來我沒有流過一滴淚，但我的心，唉！上帝，我能用什麽字來形容我的苦痛呢？我需要他立刻轉來，或者身邊有一支手槍，但這兩個希望都是不能實現的，那麽，我的苦痛要繼續刊什麽時候呢？上帝！</p>
<p>昨天是在昏迷中過去的，我以為他出去採集昆虫去了，晚飯時總會回來的。但是今天我淸醒了，完全淸醒了！我明白他眞的離開我，一個人孤零零地踏那生疏的，遙遠的旅途上去了！我是一個人住在這空虛的席闊的房子裏。唉！這房子空虛得太可怕了，牠簡直像一座古城似的那麼死氣沉沉地鎖住了我——一隻失了母親的小羔羊，離羣的孤雁。從窗口望過去，有被太陽晒枯了的鳳仙，鷄冠花，有關在　子裏掉了羽毛的小為，也有在花間翩翩飛舞的蝴蝶。但我不高興看花，也不高興看蝴蝶，我只嘆息那只被關在籠子裏的小烏。我不知牠是什麼時候來到籠子裏的，自從失掉了牠的自由以後，整天在籠裏亂鑽亂呌，看看牠身上的羽毛一根一根地掉了下來，腹部一天天瘦了下去，連校工放進出的水，也被牠掙扎着的脚踢倒不吃了。唉！那只小為的焦灼和悲哀，我深深地嘗到了！我是一隻大鳥，被關在大的籠子裏，雖然我比牠自由，可以開了籠子的門跑出去，但大的籠子之外還有更大的籠子，那是任你如何飛也飛不去的。我和小鳥的生活有什麽區別呢？一點也沒有。</p>
<p>今天上午，我把時間消磨在醫院裏，唐醫生是曼納的朋友，同時是我的朋友畹秋的姐姐，為着有變重的朋友關係，她特別關心我的病，也特別仔細地為我診察，治療。今天她一看見我，就驚訝我的臉色為什麽這樣難看？我吿訴她因為精神不好，兩天來頭昏得厲害，時時都像要暈倒下去的樣子。她說：「你一定睡眠不足，你太不注意身體了，到了這個地步，還不特別保養是不成的！」</p>
<p>我能回答她什麽呢？難道還吿訴她我失眠嗎？我默默地聽着她懇摯的勸吿，內心裏充滿了感激和慚愧。</p>
<p>「今天開兩樣補藥給你吃，如果精神還是這個樣子，下次來，要吃貴一點的補藥才行；但你需要出藥費。」</p>
<p>她望了望我的黃瘦的臉後這樣鄭重地說。</p>
<p>「好的。」</p>
<p>我的聲音低微到幾乎只有自己聽到，我心裏想究竟她和我的交情還不深，不能算是我的「知己」，我的病那裏是幾包藥粉，幾瓶藥水能治得好的呢？她更不知道我是只能吃不要錢的藥。</p>
<p>（這裏的省立醫院，由上午九點半至十二點是施診的，一律不收醫藥費，只要兩個大銅板掛號，覆診初診都是一樣。）</p>
<p>由醫院出來，為了英的要求，我陪她去木龍洞玩，那對賣甜酒雞蛋和花生的老夫婦，仍然用像那天我和維去時看到的微笑歡迎我，可是我的心情沒有那天的愉快，只機械地買了兩堆花生吃完就走了。</p>
<p>回來吃午飯的時間，我把飯送到口裏，像嚼看沙子一般吞不下，連最喜歡吃的蝦米炒白菜，也像嚼枯葉似的咽不下，終於吃不到半碗就放下筷子了</p>
<p>這時已經是六點半了，外面正下着大雨，我剛吃了一碗沙子似的飯，最後一口還含在嘴裏使來寫這些用苦痛組成的筆跡。我不敢告訴維這兩天來的生活，我害怕他駡我。他是希望我過着純理智的生活，不許被情感斷送了前途的，「第一先把身體洽好，然後多讀書，多寫作！」臨走的早晨，天邊還只是灰白色，他這樣凄然地對我說。這是他的期望，也是他的命令，我難道不遵從嗎？</p>
<p>他又說過：「女人不能做大事的，老是過着情感的生活，什麽事却不用腦筋去想。」我曾好幾次和他辯駁，自己下决心要做一個理智勝於感情，不，理智簡直要完全統制情感的人。但沒有效用，儘管你自己怎樣明白不應談愛情感支配，但事實理智早巳戰敗，不知跑到什麽地方去了，有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>記得是三年前的秋天，垢乘晚車去南京轉乘津浦車北上，我和她一家人都去送行，不久拿紅綠旗子的把哨子一吹，紅旗一搖，車就開始蠕動，那時亞子先生還緊緊地握着垢的手不放，後來車走得快了，他竟飛也似的跟着車子跑上前去，我連忙趕去拖住了他，他全身都在顫抖。當時我也說不出安慰他的話來，只是陪着他掉了兩顆熱淚——這淚，是由「父子之愛」感動得流出來的。</p>
<p>「為什麽這樣傷心？」我想問他，但立刻覺得這是「愚問」，溜到了嘴邊的話又縮回去了。但我始終不明白他為什麽愛垢愛到這個地步，母親沒有流淚，拾得女兒去北平，他卻難挖難離，傷心到這個樣子。我有一次曾問他：「你沒有理智的嗎？」是的，我沒有理智，我也不懂得什麽是理智！」當時我一方面奇怪他為什麽會說出這樣肯定，堅决的話來，同時也責備自己太魯莽，對於前輩說話，是不應該這樣不客氣的。然而我的話已經說出來了，幸喜亞子先生能够原諒我，以後也沒有把我的魯莽留在腦中</p>
<p>「我沒有理智，我也不懂得什麽是理智！」當時我覺得這兩句話有點太情感，甚至於太豈有此理，然而我現在自己正處在那樣的環境裏，「我沒有理智，我也不懂得什麽是理智！」</p>
<p>雨，越下越大了，維呵，你道時是在漆黑的伙舖裏，借着豆大的燈光給我寫信，還是趟在船板上聽雨點打在晒簞上的聲音而垂淚呢？……</p>
<h3>悲劇</h3>
<p>— 絮絮</p>
<p>從貧困之中掙扎着生長，</p>
<p>又在瘤疾中掙扎着歸去。</p>
<p>這就是你一生的歷史，</p>
<p>和生活肉搏的一齣悲劇。</p>
<p>如今，你是倒了，</p>
<p>這戰鬥便輪到你的兒子：</p>
<p>以鐵的　　來担當一切吧，</p>
<p>我也試扮個悲劇的角色。</p>
<p>你從鋤柄上煆煉出膂力，</p>
<p>從重担下　琢出意志：</p>
<p>靑春是被風雨侵蝕了，</p>
<p>却也造就了一些事業。</p>
<p>命運却不肯讓你為閒，</p>
<p>縱然你己筋疲力殫：</p>
<p>復溫夢里落下一串泳雹，</p>
<p>把你的希望毀滅。</p>
<p>你陰晦的眼光猶燃燒着憤火，</p>
<p>你凄凉的喀嗽在替代着悲歌：</p>
<p>如今你雖然是倒了，然而可怕的生活，</p>
<p>又抓緊了你的兒子—我！</p>
<p>我不能在你的墓頭放聲痛哭，</p>
<p>也沒有悲淚似潰决的洪流：</p>
<p>我只咬緊牙齦洗鍊着自己，</p>
<p>準備和生活來一番肉搏！</p>
<p>整千整萬的農民都已沒落，</p>
<p>你的命運並不是孤獨。</p>
<p>讓你的噩夢也安眠在墓里吧，</p>
<p>時代的暴風已經在呼囂。</p>
<p>你該不斥我的愚庸吧？</p>
<p>我不會逢迎更不會發跡：</p>
<p>只像一隻螞蟻盡牠的工作。</p>
<p>為了克服我們的命運，</p>
<p>祇有血淋淋的兩字：「肉搏」。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>國聯行政院中國理事席可望實現</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>本月四日開會的國聯行政院會議，除却討論意阿爭端外，中國理事席位問題，亦列為議程之一，將被提出討論。此事關係於我國國際地位，十分重要。故我人當國聯行政院行將舉行會議之際，將我國運動再入行政院的經過，報吿於讀者之前。想亦為關心國事者所樂聞也。</p>
<p>我國自去年九月間，國聯大會改選非常任理事時，以二十一票對土耳其的四十八票落選以後，卽希望在行政院得一特別席位。惟該問題非先得行政院各理事一致同意，不能提交大會。故自當時起，我國駐歐各外交人員，卽着手進行運動，分別向各國接洽。迨至今年五月間，國聯行政院召開常會時，駐英郭使因見此事接洽後，甚為圓滿，遂致一正式說帖於國聯行政院主席李維諾夫，要求中國在行政院得一席位。當日討論結果，該說帖在原則上已一致通過，决定提出九月行政院會議，公開討論，再提交大會。此為我國運動理事席位經過的大概。聞英國艾登曾對郭使表示，願極力贊助中國重入行政院。又本年六月間，在比京召集的國聯協會大會，亦有一决議案，協助中國在國聯行政院得一理事席位。由上述種種情形觀察，今番國聯行政院常會，我國理事席位問題，或有實現的可能，亦未可知。</p>
<p>茲再就我國要求重入國聯行政院的理由，叙述幾點於下。一，國聯行政院自去年中國落選，及今年日本退出國聯生效後，已缺乏亞洲代表。二，基於國聯之威信及國際合作的基礎，中國應有參加行政院的必要。三，中國在亞洲，處重要地位，有代表亞洲出席行政院的査格。四，遠東問題甚為嚴重，中國應與國聯切實接觸。五，中國始終信賴國聯，與國聯實行合作，其關係甚為密切。國聯第七屆大會第一委員會主席莫達，當時因主張充實行政院亞洲代表，曾謂，我人不能輕視眼前，尤其是將來，亞洲偉大民衆的要求，及其日益富强的情形。故根據上述幾項理田，中國之應重行參加行政院，實為事實上正當的要求。不知行政院將作何决議也議也。</p>
<h3>明湖秋色</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>秋天的脚步從北方隨風飄到濟南，飄到濟南的大明湖畔，巡逡在大明湖的蘆葦上了。這是一件平常的事情：秋天是每年要來的，來人間向人們作一久遠的低訴：每當你靜靜地聽到一種聲音飄過，那便是他在說話了。</p>
<p>有一個時期，我住在離大明湖不遠的一家客棧裏，找尋工作，早晨的時間常常地是消麼在湖上的。</p>
<p>當曉風拂摸着大地，朝霞織在東方</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>的天際，我又來這裏了。</p>
<p>人自然很少，聲音簡直就是沒有。誰也不願把大家安靜的心情，打出一片波紋，脚步輕輕的輕輕的，享受一個秋之晨光。我挾着一冊剳記簿，像別人一樣沿着石砌的長堤走着，趁腦子格外淸醒，把冊子打開讀上幾頁總是人間難得的快樂</p>
<p>秋天感覺最快的似乎便是蘆葦，雖在剛交秋天，在大明湖上已看出色調的變遷。一年中，春天着到抽出嫩緣：夏天看到濃綠：冬天看到灰白：在這秋天，我們眼前鏽着的却像一個暮年的女尼披一身感傷的顏色：說不出的種味泛上心頭，當你孤獨地看到那種顏色的時候。尤其是一個流浪者，看到金風吹着世界末日的到來，更要唱一闋使人流淚的歌曲了。</p>
<p>歷下亭不是往日的亭子了：他已不復是古舊的樣式，現在已經換上一套新的秋衫，一層漂亮的油彩，朝陽從東邊拋出溫和的光綫，黃色的瓦便反射出不同角度的光芒，不像往常那樣：一座古老的廟院，看不到光彩。</p>
<p>雖然棹遊的人少了，一隻隻的船因失修而損毀，長長的行列在司家碼頭，鵲華橋，北極閣，前乾健門里等處，有時幾個名士或異鄉的遊客却依然來玩玩的，不過很少了。</p>
<p>但是，我每天早晨是碰不到的。</p>
<p>只有幾個西裝的大學生在來回的走着。警察舉着方步或操式，幾株高大的枯樹上，鴉巢邊，探出幾個黑色的腦袋。小溪：「工工……」地流過石灘。如果你站在小橋或者蘆葦挾着的條條的長堤上，聽水流的自然的韻律，或瞿瞿的低微的自高的鳴聲：假如你不怕水凉，懂得蟹子，看淸蟹穴，伸手便能模出一支肥大的蟹，或者看銀魚反轉着雪白的肚皮。</p>
<p>最近接到北國朋友來信，詢問我秋的消息，並且報告我大明湖的近况，他說「大明湖的秋天像一杯濃濃的酒，當你初次接近他的時候，威到新鮮與潑棘，你愛他的顏色（那樣深），你愛他的味，（那樣厚），你愛他的性格，（安靜的像老處女），你愛他的風度，（眞會安慰人），但是當你和他接近的久了，你討厭了他的滋味，的顏色，的性格，的風度，你會看到他就厭倦。……」</p>
<p>也許我還沒有接近他長久的時間，看到他的來信，更使我增加了對大明湖的戀戀。</p>
<h3>秋景</h3>
<p>— 江敉作</p>
<h3>秋蠶</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>販蠶種的李老五躭擱在東園茶館裏已經有半個月了，照顧他生意的可很少，鄉下人都不預備養秋蠶了嗎？不是，　勢口能使他們掙幾個錢貼補家用的事，他們無有不竭全力以赴之的。他們所以遲遲未向李老五買蠶種，有兩個理由，一是自己不該桑田的人家，還沒凑到錢定葉。二是稻子的收成還在渺茫中而沒有把握，萬一秋收絕望，這筆養蠶的本錢從那裏來？不景氣的市面把鄉下人的胆量愈迫愈小了。「外面大大的銀行還要倒，何况我們……』他們動不動就把這話吐出嘴來。他們再也背不起一些經濟上的風險。</p>
<p>李老五因兜不着生意便開碼頭走了，大家可又着起急來，沒有蠶種就養不成秋蠶，今年絲價有了些起色，誰都不肯放棄這最後一季的蠶爾，因此大家又東奔西走的想法買蠶種了，價錢亦抬高了一角左右改良種不論鷹牌老虎牌平日一律賣四角，縣裏出過吿示不許私自抬價，但販戶總有藉口，說是要貼補點車馬費，鄉下人因時機侷促了，只得認吃虧買來。東壩頭陸宏坤買兩張就化了一塊兩角錢，這筆欽子還是當掉了棉被得來的？</p>
<p>二眠開葉的時候，陸宏坤和他的妻子女兒日夜沒得空暇，一方面忙著喂飼，一方面又得憂慮着行將斷檔的葉子，他本來有五六畝桑田在村西，可是早在夏裏以每担一元七角半的代價包給大嚴叔公了，大嚴叔公是不養蠶的，不過他該錢做這宗買賣，現在他開價三元四角賣出，辛辛苦苦，胼手胝足的養蠶人的收穫還飄渺於天空的時候，他却現現成成不化一絲氣力的在掙錢了。陸宏坤曾去向大嚴叔公商酌欠兩担葉，被拒絕了，他跑過自己的桑田，滿腔的悲哀化了淚水滾向眼眶邊，他想不透：「為什麽養蠶的弄不到桑葉？為什麽自己桑田裏的葉子輪不到自己剪？該錢的又為什麽專在窮人身上盤算？』</p>
<p>陸宏坤家的蠶因為　　不勻，就有一部份起了僵縮的變化。被憂憤困纏着的神經顯然起了變態，優狂的變態——陸宏坤打妻子了，又還惡毒地駡着：「你吃飽了飯幹什麼的，這點蠶被你遭壞了，老子化一塊二角買蠶種，二塊四角一担的桑葉遝不肯欠，不肯欠……」他駡到後來便出眼淚了，他心裏又明白過來：「妻子和女兒是和我一樣的勞苦，一樣的雙眼瞪瞪望着竹篇裹扭動着的灰色的秋蠶，一樣的把心血和精力都餵給蠶了啊！我還忍心打她們嗎，她們不是和我一樣想過好些的生活嗎！」</p>
<p>他定下神，望着眼睛哭得像胡桃的妻子和女兒，他眼前覺得昏花而搖曳，一隻一隻蠶架都像要傾倒下來的樣子，「絲價有了些起色……」這在他，正好像個預備一溫的甜夢，滿含着辛酸味和牽連着血絲的夢啊。「吱吱吱……」輕微的蠶食桑葉的聲音。窗外吹進一陣秋夜的風，壁上的媒油燈盞幾乎被吹熄滅……</p>
<h3>秋景</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>小姑娘們，打着笆兒（註一）上山去了。</p>
<p>靜穆的空氣，圍繞在四週的無組織的雜亂的樹林里。</p>
<p>——秋天了。</p>
<p>是的又是秋天了。</p>
<p>她們，一到秋天，便合着夥兒到樹林裏去掃葉了。一年一回的事，在這些活潑的小姑娘們看起來，是無上的一件樂事。</p>
<p>——小秀呢？</p>
<p>一個披着紫色頭布的小姑娘沉靜地問着她旁邊的，那個有二條小辮兒的姑娘。</p>
<p>——唔，她出嫁了。</p>
<p>——去年不是也打着笆兒上山去的嗎？</p>
<p>——是呵。</p>
<p>——日子過得眞快呵。</p>
<p>她揩着鼻子上的灰粒，那麽淡淡地太息地說着。那個梳着小辮子的姑娘，輕輕地說：</p>
<p>——但是，時常給丈夫叨叨（註二）的，正是她吓。</p>
<p>那淡紅的嘴唇，染着秋意的嘴唇，微笑了。一忽兒，她又忍住了笑，把頭上的那塊紫色的頭巾除下來，抿着嘴巴說：</p>
<p>——小秀怕男人家？</p>
<p>——她還怕公公婆婆呲。有一次，　因為忘記喂了一次穀兒給雞子吃，婆婆就缺德的把她打得靑一塊紫一塊。</p>
<p>——去年，去年她不是跟我們在一塊兒「搶三十」（註三）的嗎？</p>
<p>她們兩個子都太息了。走着，悄悄地走着，早晨的像一個病人那麽陰悒的秋天的太陽光，輕柔地浮在她們的頭上，浮在她們的心上。</p>
<p>——明年春上，阿心也要出嫁了。</p>
<p>——嫁男人是挺靠不住的！他們的心，眞比鋼鐵還堅硬呢。</p>
<p>——可是，我們的祖父我們的父親不是多很和藹嗎？我眞不懂：他們也同樣是一個男人。</p>
<p>——希望阿心嫁到一個好丈夫！</p>
<p>——是的，希望她如此。</p>
<p>兩個子羞恥地笑了。臉上都浮起了一層紅雲，為什麽呢？因為她們都還是聖處女哩。在村上，一個沒有出嫁的女子，胡談男子們的事，是要受『訾道』（註五）的。</p>
<p>現在是在山谷裏，太陽光也不能全部的透進來，難道兩個子的對話就會給山壁傳佈出去嗎？所以她們都安心地私自胡談着，然而，她們的一顆沒有訓練的處女的心，是容易受羞的呵。</p>
<p>——昨天你家裏吃什麽菜？</p>
<p>有紫色的頭巾的姑娘，把話題故意措開了。</p>
<p>——祇是一碗黃荳芽。</p>
<p>——還不錯呢。</p>
<p>——那麽你家裏吃什麽呢？</p>
<p>前面有四五個小姑娘在走着，她們都很悲悒——</p>
<p>她們兩個子向在前面走着的一夥小姑娘瞧了一眼。她接着跟那梳小辮子的姑娘說：</p>
<p>——我們家裏，祇有菜吃，沒有白米，也沒有　　吓。</p>
<p>——唉。</p>
<p>——唉，將來我們不知要怎樣呵？</p>
<p>太息地，她們加快了脚步，她們將跟前面走着的那一羣人合夥去。她們都想着掃葉的那回趣事，又想着晚上煮坎時可以用枯葉來代替柴木了。</p>
<p>註一：是一種用篾製的掃葉器具。</p>
<p>註二：駡人。</p>
<p>註三；是一種游戲。</p>
<p>註四：比「叨叨』更甚的罵人語。</p>

<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>据說被捧為「東方標準美人」的徐來，因為鑒于上海的空氣不大好，所以打算到外埠去一次。不過這意見「標準丈夫」是反對的，他要奮鬥到底。</p>
<p>藍蘋小姐自從對他的訪問者說了不喜歡胡蝶和胡萍的演技後，近日來各報上都　來作話柄。（不，是罪狀。）</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi and Others Return to Nanjing Yesterday After Disaster Assessment: Disaster Situation in Jiangsu and Shandong Both Very Serious; Emergency Relief Measures Agreed Upon with Han; Kong Visits Wang to Report on Inspection</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Secretary-General of the Economic Council Qin Fen, Director of the Water Conservancy Department Zheng Zhaojing, Counselor Li Kaixuan, Technical Expert Wu Youxin, and others, completed their inspection of the Yellow River disaster and arrived in Nanjing at 11:00 AM on the 5th. Kong stated that during this trip to various places in Xuzhou and Yanzhou, they met with Jiangsu Construction Director Shen Baixian and Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu, inspecting the collapsed dikes at Jiulishan, Weihu, Taodi, and Jining. He observed that both Jiangsu and Shandong provinces were making efforts to plan for flood prevention and rescue. Regarding governance measures, detailed discussions were also held with Chairman Han and Director Shen. The Economic Council will cooperate with the respective provincial governments to jointly plan for prevention, control, and disaster relief measures. Qin stated that the flood situation in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu was devastating, with widespread disaster areas and extremely tragic scenes. Minister Kong had discussed the governance and relief measures with Chairman Han, and remedial measures could be decided upon immediately. Kong went to the ministry at 6:00 PM to handle ministry affairs and received Fu Rulin, Ge Jingyou, and others. Because the Shanghai office and the Central Bank had important matters to be dealt with, Kong took the night train to Shanghai at 11:00 PM that evening. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Kong Xiangxi and his party, along with Han Fuqu and others, went to Jining from Yanzhou yesterday to inspect the water situation and comfort the disaster victims. After returning to Yanzhou, Kong and Han went to Qufu to visit the Confucius Temple and only returned to Yanzhou to head south at night. This morning at 3:00 AM, they passed through Xuzhou and returned to Nanjing to convene an Economic Council meeting. After Shao Hanyuan met with Han, the Yellow River prevention and water diversion situation in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu was also clarified. Jiangsu and Shandong decided to unite in preventing Yellow River floods and providing disaster relief. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi went to the No. 1 official residence of the Ministry of Railways at 4:00 PM on the 5th to meet with Director Wang and report on the inspection of the Yellow River disaster. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi, Qin Fen, Zheng Zejing, Chen Mingge, and others, finished their inspection of the Yellow River flood situation in Jiangsu and Shandong and the suffering of the people. They returned to Pukou by the original train at 10:30 AM on the 5th. Senior officials from the Ministry of Finance all went to the station to greet them. After Kong and others took the Anning ferry across the river, they entered the city and returned to their residences to rest. It is heard that in addition to listening to the flood prevention report in northern Jiangsu, Kong and others also agreed on emergency measures for the Yellow River with Han Fuqu. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi returned to Nanjing at 11:30 AM on the morning of the 5th. It is heard that Kong's trip north had three tasks: (1) To communicate the opinions of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces on Yellow River prevention. When Kong went north, he invited Tang Xiang, Li Wenzhai, and others to accompany him so that they could conveniently inspect the actual flood prevention situation in the provinces. After arriving in Xuzhou, he also invited Shao Hanyuan to accompany him to inspect the Yongding River disaster in Shandong and introduced Shao to Han Fuqu to discuss everything, all in order to communicate the opinions of Jiangsu and Shandong provinces on Yellow River prevention. (2) To represent the central government in expressing its concern for the suffering and conveying its intention to leave Germany, and to comfort the affected elders. Kong had earnestly comforted the disaster victims in the Jining area and informed them of the disaster relief policies that the central government had decided on. (3) To discuss emergency measures for closing breaches with Han. A general agreement has been reached on this point. As for Li Yizhi, Zhang Honglie, and others, they did not come south to meet Kong because they were holding a breach closure meeting in Jining on the 4th. The decision previously made by the Economic Council of the Executive Yuan to open the people's embankments in the Zhencheng area to release the Yellow River water flowing south and return to the Zheng River from the Huangshan Temple will also have to wait for the closure meeting in Shandong Province to conclude before there can be concrete results. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi visited Director Wang of the Executive Yuan on the afternoon of the 5th to report on the disaster inspection. He then went to the ministry to handle ministry affairs and received Jinling Customs Supervisor Zhang Gengnian, Anhui Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau Chief Jing Xuxin, and others, and gave instructions. He scheduled a night train to Shanghai. Because the disaster in Shandong was severe, Kong and his wife, Ms. Soong Ai-ling, donated 10,000 silver dollars for relief, designating 5,000 to be allocated to the existing disaster victims in Jining, and the remainder to be allocated by the Shandong Provincial Government at its discretion. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi spoke about the inspection of the flood disaster, briefly saying that he arrived in Xuzhou at 7:00 AM on the 4th, received Commissioner Shao Hanyuan, and listened to the flood disaster report. He then went to Pipa Mountain and Jiuli Mountain to visit the affected people. Then he went to the Bulao River to see the river water rushing down. At Liguo Station, everything west of the railway was a vast expanse of water. North of Hanzhuang, the water had already reached the Jinpu Railway subgrade. At 2:00 PM, he arrived in Yanzhou, where Han Fuqu, Kong Decheng, Sun Tongxuan, and others were all present. After inquiring about the disaster situation in detail, he boarded a train to the branch line of Jining. Going west, he saw the lake water overflowing the fields. At Jining Station, he saw more than 10,000 disaster victims gathered. Many shelters had been set up. It is estimated that about 170,000 disaster victims in Shandong Province have been relocated to various counties, 670,000 are waiting to be relocated, and more than one million have not yet been sheltered. After giving detailed guidance on various matters, he also spoke to the disaster victims. Then he walked to the Grand Canal levee and went south to Zhao Zhuang. As far as the eye could see, the water and the sky met, with only the city of Jining remaining as a piece of land. That evening, he returned to Yanzhou. Together with Han Fuqu, he traveled by car to Qufu to pay respects at the Confucius Temple. At 11:00 PM, he returned south by the original train. It is said that the day Kong left Nanjing was his birthday. Kong had the heart of one who felt the hunger and drowning of others, so he set out on that day. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangrong Arrives in Jinan to Visit Han and Discuss Breach Closure</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Kong Xiangrong arrived in Jinan to visit Han and discuss breach closure. Kong advocated extending the Jiangsu dam in the Yangtze River and increasing the power to guide the flow northward. There is a stone dam west of Zhukou that should also be extended to guide the flow northward, which would reduce the danger at Zhukou. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Flow Diverted into the Liutang River</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River flow from Weihu is divided into three streams that flow into the Central Canal. Currently, because the construction of the canal lock and the Huai River diversion project has not been completed, the flood control office is rushing to build a grass dam to block water from entering the canal. This has prevented the canal water from being discharged and diverted it into the Liutang River. The water is surging and overflowing the banks, and the counties of Hai and Shu are about to become a swamp. Furthermore, upstream of the Zaohe River in the canal, the embankments at Liudian and Shuangzhuang have been flooded due to their low elevation, causing disaster on both sides. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Liutang River has surged, and the water in Baojia River, Dingjiatang, and other places in the fifth district of Huaiyin has overflowed, making it impossible to cross without a boat. The confluence of the six Liutang Rivers before and after Jinzhuang is particularly critical. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The level of the Wei River has risen by 7 centimeters today, with a storage of 36.887 meters. The level of the Yao River has risen by 4 inches, with a storage of 222 inches. The level of the Su River has risen by 3 inches, with a storage of 228 inches. The levee of the lower section of the inner canal is low and narrow, and residents are rushing to repair it. There are also women who have cut their hair to join the work, and the situation is tense. Commissioner Wang of Huaiyin District also convened a Yellow River prevention meeting with representatives of the people along the canal today. Huaiyin recommended Wang Shuxiang to attend. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water situation in northern Tongshan was relatively stable yesterday and today. However, a section of the Qing Shantou transverse levee of the Jinpu Railway was washed away by the water. After being rushed to block by the people of the first district, the breach has been blocked. After the southern levee downstream of the Bulao River broke, the water flowed from the Fangting River through the sixth and ninth districts of Tongdong into the territory of Pi, flowing towards Bayiji. The farmland on both sides of the Jia River has been affected. The six commissioners sent by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to Xuzhou to assist in Yellow River prevention and disaster relief have inspected the downstream of the Bulao River and the west levee of Weihu, and have also visited Fengpei to negotiate with the local authorities. It has been decided that in the future, water will be resisted on the one hand, and disaster relief will be actively handled on the other. The commissioners will stay in Xuzhou and will not return to the province for the time being. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Breach of the Hutuo River Embankment</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The embankment of the Hutuo River in the Yangyouzi Village area of Anping County breached on the 4th, with water several feet deep on the plain. The overflowing water washed away dozens of miles, and more than 600 houses in the villages along the river collapsed. The elderly and young disaster victims are gathered on high ground. The county government has built sheds to provide relief to avoid sleeping in the open. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Disaster Relief Association Appeals for Aid</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Disaster Relief Association telegraphed the Shanghai Water Disaster Relief Associations, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, and others on the 5th, saying that the Yellow River water overflowed, causing disasters in Tongshan, Fengxian, Pi, and Pei, with more than 200,000 disaster victims urgently needing relief. It is respectfully requested that funds and supplies be allocated for emergency relief. It also telegraphed the Tongshan District Office to investigate the actual number of disaster victims, and the number of able-bodied men, women, children, and the elderly, and to classify the severity of the disaster situation in order to formulate relief measures for submission to the association for approval. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hankou Flood Disaster Relief Association Decides to Further Expand Fundraising</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Flood Disaster Relief Association decided to convene an expanded fundraising meeting due to the severity of the disaster and the small amount of relief funds. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Central Standing Committee Passes Resolution to Postpone the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee; Decides to Postpone the Meeting to November 1; National Congress Still to be Held as Originally Planned</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 187th regular meeting at 8:00 AM on the 5th. Ye Chucang, Wang Zhaoming, Ju Zheng, Bo Wenwei, Zhang Zhen, Huang Musong, Zhou Qigang, Xiao Zhongzhen, and 28 others attended. Wang Zhaoming presided over the meeting. The following important cases were resolved: (1) The Sixth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee will be postponed to November 1. (2) The Fifth National Congress will still be held on November 12 this year, as originally planned. (3) The remaining funds collected by the Disaster Area Winter Relief Committee will be allocated to flood disaster relief. (4) Committee Member Luo Jialun was recommended to give a report at next Monday's Central Commemoration Week. (5) Other routine cases. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the postponement of the Sixth Plenary Session, a certain committee member had proposed postponing it to October 20. After review, it was considered that the Fifth National Congress would be held in mid-November, and October 20 was less than a month away. All committee members have their own duties and it would be difficult for them to wait for a long time, and traveling back and forth would be inconvenient for both public and private matters. Handling reception would also require two procedures. It would be better to change it to November 1, so that the committee members could participate in the Fifth National Congress after completing the Sixth Plenary Session with a short break. During this short period, committee members who have never met and those who have reunited after a long absence can take this opportunity to exchange political views, which would avoid the labor of correspondence and the running around of representatives. Official meetings would then be less likely to be hampered by unfamiliarity. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhukou Has Passed the Dangerous Period</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The light rail tracks stored in this city have now been transported to Lanfeng and then to Dongzhuang to repair the road and transport breach closure materials. 7.5 kilometers can be laid. Zhukou has rushed to repair the new embankments, 29 sections. The dangerous period has passed. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Commissioner's Office received a telegram from western Shandong stating that the Yellow River water level at Zhukou has dropped, and it seems that there is no immediate danger. Kong Xiangrong, along with Liu Bingzhong, the flood control director of the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, arrived in Xuzhou from Kaifeng this morning. He took the midday train north to Jinan to meet with Han to discuss closing the Dongzhuang and Zhukou breaches and building stone dams. Kong said that the Zhukou breach was impacted by water on the 2nd, and the sweep water dams on both sides collapsed. After supervising soldiers and civilians day and night to rush to block it, the situation has turned from danger to safety. The current water level at Zhukou is decreasing, and there is no danger of an accident. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Economic Council Standing Committee Postponed to Next Week</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Council originally planned to convene a standing committee meeting after Kong Xiangxi and others completed their inspection of the Yellow River disaster and returned to Nanjing to discuss and decide on cases such as rescuing the Yellow River and implementing fundamental measures for managing rivers. However, because the two standing committee members Sun Ke and Song Ziwen are still in Shanghai on official business, it will be changed to next week. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>River Management Plan Submitted to Political Council for Review</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Association's proposed Yangtze River management plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Central Political Council for review by the Economic Council. The Political Council decided to hand it over for review. The plan requires a total expenditure of more than 200 million yuan, including the cost of dredging Poyang Lake, Dongting Lake, and the Xiang River. If the customs surtax of 6 million yuan per year is collected, it will take 30 years to complete the project. It is heard that the government authorities intend to allocate a certain amount of money each year in addition to the customs surtax to shorten the construction period. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yongding River Management Plan Determined</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Yongding River management project plan has been determined. The north and south levees of the river are each more than 500 li long. During this year's flood season, there were more than 40 dangerous points due to scouring. All were fortified with dams. Because the river dikes are mostly made of silt, they are prone to collapse when hit by a large current. Men Zhenzhong, director of the Yongding River Bureau, suggested to the provincial government that more than ten gates should be built on the north and south dikes, each gate costing about 70,000 yuan. The provincial government, lacking funds, has telegraphed the Economic Council to allocate funds, and will immediately reorganize the dangerous works of the embankment. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level at Sugou Bridge and Huilong Temple on the Yongding River fell on the morning of the 5th, with the highest point being 1 zhang and 5 cun. The current has stabilized. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Baoding telephoned to report that the flood season has passed and the rivers are safe. On the 4th, the Construction Department ordered the withdrawal of defenses from the four rivers, the South Canal, the North Canal, the Ziya River, and the Daqing River. The employees stationed in each section will return to the bureau on the 6th. However, because the water level of the Yongding River has not fully receded, the defenses must be withdrawn in the latter half of the month. (5th Special Dispatch)</p>

Committee members Wang Zhengting, Weng Wenhao, Zhao Jinqing, Lu Kaiyuan, Wang Zhengfu, Zhang Hu, Huang Jintao, and six others attended. Chen Gongbo also attended the meeting and presided over it, explaining the reasons for the establishment of the association, briefly stating that the original plan to issue public bonds to help the mining industry was not implemented due to the uncertainty of the fund. Now, a loan is being held by the banking industry to provide relief. Because there are many coal merchants in our country's mining industry, the relief method also focuses on the coal industry, and it is hoped that this association will work hard to develop the mining industry. Wang Zhengting then delivered a reply on behalf of the association. In addition to hoping that the Industrial Department would request the relevant agencies to reduce freight and mineral taxes, he also stated that the association's future task is to ensure that the funds are used in appropriate places, so that costs are low, transportation is convenient, and sales are smooth, so that it can gradually develop. Then, the discussion on loan methods and all handling rules began, and all were decided. It can be announced and implemented after being submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The loan totaled 10 million yuan, and the Industrial Department issued a guarantee. A general contract has been signed. Coal companies must first submit a repayment guarantee and repayment method, which will be reviewed and approved by the association and the banking industry before signing a loan sub-contract. However, the total amount of loans for each mine is 10 million yuan. It is also heard that the association will be located in Shanghai for convenience of handling affairs, and will hold meetings every two months thereafter. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— In Brief</p>
<p>The Yangtze River flood has just come to an end, but the alarm of the Yellow River's overflowing banks continues to reverberate in our ears daily. The Zhuangkou gate, due to insufficient reinforcement, has burst open, causing disaster everywhere. Recently, the water level of Weishan Lake has suddenly risen, and signs of a crisis in the central canal are becoming increasingly apparent. The people of southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu are either toiling tirelessly to protect the dangerous works, or anxiously seeking funds. Those already affected by the disaster are undoubtedly suffering from the ravages of the flood, while those not yet affected are deeply apprehensive about the potential disaster. This dire situation has persisted for a long time without relief, already a great tragedy in the world. Moreover, future disasters are still unpredictable. Looking north with concern, one cannot help but feel deeply anxious.</p>
<p>The central government has been carefully planning disaster relief measures recently. For instance, the integrated river management plan passed by the Executive Yuan is the result of thorough research by Chinese and foreign engineers, and its implementation should not encounter significant obstacles. Furthermore, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, along with Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Commission, have jointly traveled north to inspect the disaster situation and plan to meet with Han Fuqu, Li Yizhi, and others to discuss everything in person. They will certainly consider both guiding the flow of water and providing disaster relief. However, the disaster area is vast and the engineering projects are numerous. Once started, they require substantial funds. Without adequate preparation, it will be difficult to achieve tangible results. Judging from the Central Political Council's approval of the central government employees' disaster relief assistance measures yesterday and the river management expenses listed in Kong's plan, it seems that the authorities are now able to seek practical solutions based on needs, rather than just making empty promises as in the past. This is a somewhat encouraging sign for the future of disaster relief.</p>
<p>Civilian organizations have already begun providing relief to the disaster areas, and some progress has been made. However, due to the decline of the national economy, the amount of aid is still insufficient. As for water management projects, they are a matter of national importance and should not involve the people. Especially when the national treasury is depleted as it is today, even if the government has deep plans, it is feared that they will become empty promises halfway through. For the sake of the entire relief effort, it is worth advocating a broad fundraising campaign and collectively calling it a disaster relief fund. Once a certain amount is collected, it can be allocated. Regarding fundraising methods, various parties have offered suggestions. Some advocate that the government reduce public construction expenditures to allocate funds for relief (see Ta Kung Pao). Others suggest diverting a portion of funds from aviation and highway lottery tickets (see Independent Review). Some propose that each person contribute one yuan, and that schools, families, institutions, and organizations implement this separately (see Xue Lin West News). These are all unique perspectives that should be considered separately. As for the central government employees' salary deduction for disaster relief assistance, it is, in principle, something we welcome. However, the provision that those with monthly salaries above fifty-five yuan should donate half a month's salary may not be a problem for middle and upper-level staff, but for lower-level staff earning around sixty yuan, it may be difficult to manage if they have no other income. Therefore, while the proportion of this measure may seem balanced, the actual discrepancies are quite significant. A way to remedy this would be for senior officials in various agencies to voluntarily donate large sums in addition to the prescribed rate, as an example. This is also a necessary embellishment to any fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>In summary, raising a disaster relief fund should be regarded as the most urgent task at present. Whether it is to prepare for water management proactively or to provide disaster relief to the victims reactively, the entire nation should work together to achieve this. The fact that these two major rivers in the country cause annual floods not only results in the destruction of fields and homes and the displacement of people and livestock, but also brings all construction to a standstill. The harm caused by this is immeasurable. Rather than accumulating annual losses, why not seek a one-time, permanent solution, using future profits to compensate for current losses? This would be a wise calculation. As for the surviving victims of the disaster, they are everywhere. Those who are fortunate enough to escape becoming food for fish will still starve. The number of those who, out of desperation, take risks and endanger public order is not insignificant. Therefore, the disaster relief movement, in its narrowest sense, is originally a kind of compassionate assistance. But from a broader perspective, it goes beyond compassion. We observe that the disaster situation has a tendency to spread like a fire consuming thatch, and soon we ourselves may face the crushing weight of collapsing beams and walls. Given this, our assistance to disaster relief today is like hands protecting the head and eyes. Is there still room for hesitation or deliberation?</p>

<h3>New Japanese Minister of the Army, Kawashima, Assumed Office Yesterday Morning; Outgoing and Incoming Ministers Released Statements</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) General Kawashima's ceremony for assuming the position of Minister of the Army and concurrently President of the Bureau of Manchurian Affairs was held at 10:00 AM today at the Emperor's Hayama Villa. Prime Minister Okada was in attendance, and the Emperor bestowed an imperial edict upon General Kawashima.</p>
<p>After General Kawashima's appointment as Minister of the Army, his attitude towards important issues within the Ministry of the Army, such as clarifying the national essence, the next fiscal year's budget, national defense policy, and Manchurian policy, is attracting considerable attention. According to general observations, the new Minister of the Army's attitude towards these issues is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of controlling the military, he will inherit Minister of the Army Hayashi's policies and thoroughly implement his instructions at the division commanders' conference, carrying out the second and third stages of work.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the issue of clarifying the national essence, he will cooperate with the government to strive to achieve the goal of rejecting the Emperor organ theory.</p>
<p>(3) He will consistently demand that the Ministry of Finance approve the full amount of the next fiscal year's budget.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding national defense policy, because it is closely related to issues such as controlling the military and rural education, he will represent the views of the Ministry and advise the government in order to achieve its implementation.</p>
<p>(5) He will also proceed with the second Manchurian policy in accordance with the policies of the previous Minister of the Army. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 5th, outgoing and incoming Ministers of the Army, Kawashima and Hayashi, released statements to the national public. The content is as follows: Minister of the Army Kawashima said, "At this time of grave crisis, I have received the imperial command and accepted military administration, and I deeply feel the weight of responsibility. The need for national unity in internal and external affairs is paramount today. I earnestly hope for cooperation from all sides to overcome all difficulties." Minister of the Army Hayashi's statement said, "With my limited virtue and talent, I previously received the imperial command and devoted myself to supporting the national destiny and overcoming the difficulties of the times. I deeply feared that my limited strength would be insufficient. However, an unfortunate incident suddenly occurred within the national army, causing unbearable fear. As the person in charge of supervising the military, I deeply felt the weight of my responsibility. Therefore, with the Emperor's approval, I resigned from my duties. Upon my departure, various parties expressed their sympathy, for which I am deeply grateful." (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The resignation of Japanese Minister of the Army Hayashi Senjuro and the succession of Kawashima have become the subject of extensive commentary in local newspapers. All newspapers stated that the new Minister of the Army has consistently maintained a neutral attitude in politics, hoping that what the Soviet Union experienced during the terms of Araki and Hayashi will not be repeated. This place especially considers Araki to be a major threat to the Soviet Union. (National News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Expelled from Vladivostok; Total of Ten Expelled, 84 Remain</h3>
<p>Tsuruga According to a telegram from Vladivostok, Araki So, from Miyazaki Prefecture, who exports rice, and Kawabe Yuiichi, from Ibaraki Prefecture, who works as an accountant at the Merchant Marine Union, have been ordered to be expelled from the local Japanese residents. They are currently appealing to the Soviet court, arguing that their expulsion is inappropriate. However, both were expelled by the 25th of last month. In addition, Sanriki Kazuichi from Fukuoka Prefecture, an employee of the Vladivostok branch of Kokusai Unyu, and Yoshida Kōjirō from Fukui Prefecture, were also forced to leave the country despite their requests to Consul General Watanabe in Vladivostok to forward their appeals to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the outcome was not satisfactory. Furthermore, Matsuda Inokichi (unemployed) from Gunma Prefecture was also given until November 20th to have his residency rights revoked, and will inevitably be expelled next month. In addition, Mr. Tsutsumi Mineichi from Fukui Prefecture, who runs an export business, was also ordered to leave the country by Soviet officials. Since the latter half of June, the total number of Japanese people who have been expelled from the country has reached ten. Therefore, it can be inferred that the total number of Japanese residents in Vladivostok is only eighty-four. (Jiji News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italian Chief of Staff Visits French Minister of the Army</h3>
<p>(Paris) General Gamellin, Chief of the General Staff of the Army, recently visited Italy. General Batoglio, Chief of the General Staff of the Italian Army, has now come to return the visit. Today, accompanied by General Balasca and Lieutenant Colonel Pittini, he paid a visit to the Minister of the Army, Fabry, and the meeting lasted until noon. Subsequently, he had lunch with former Minister of the Army Marshal Pétain and Chief of the General Staff General Gamellin. They also decided to depart for the city of Reims tomorrow to observe the large-scale maneuvers of the French Army. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Severe Storm in the United States; Approximately Four to Five Hundred Deaths</h3>
<p>Miami The islands near Key West were hit by a storm yesterday. It is reported that the death toll is approximately four to five hundred. In the areas affected by the storm, large trees were uprooted and railway tracks were overturned. According to those who escaped from the disaster area, houses were reduced to ruins, and many residents were unable to escape. Waves followed the wind, and anyone caught in their path was swept away without a trace. The South Pacific steamship Dixie, which ran aground off the coast, had a total of 375 passengers. Four other ships are currently trying to evacuate them. Although the waves are still dangerous, the passengers should be safe. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Miami A hurricane struck the state of Florida yesterday. According to the Red Cross report, approximately three hundred people have died, but private reports claim that the death toll is between five hundred and seven hundred. Today, all personnel from the Red Cross, the Florida State Police, the Federal Coast Guard, and other organizations are making every effort to rush to the disaster area for relief. The hurricane seems to have passed the Georgia line, and the wind force is gradually weakening. The stories told by the disaster victims are too horrific to bear. Of the first forty-five bodies transported here, sixteen were children and fourteen were women. The property damage in the disaster area is estimated to be worth millions of dollars. There are renewed concerns about storm disasters in the North Atlantic today. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Miami Aircraft that inspected the storm-affected areas today reported that the disaster area has become a field of rubble, and roads and railways have been swept away. The estimated losses are worth tens of millions of dollars. In many places, all fruit crops have been destroyed, and the death toll is likely to be above five hundred. After the storm entered the mainland, it is said that its force has weakened. Today, members of Congress sent telegrams to President Roosevelt and Relief Administrator Hopkins, questioning why the retired soldiers working on the islands near Key West were not immediately evacuated when they received warnings about the approaching storm, resulting in the deaths of more than four hundred people. People here are quite indignant, pointing out that the large number of deaths was due to the government's poor performance. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Labor Congress Opens; World Economic Conference; International Control of Raw Materials</h3>
<p>(London) The Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party held a joint meeting in Margate today and passed a resolution calling for the convening of a World Economic Conference. It stated that the World Conference should discuss international control measures for raw material sources and apply the principle of economic equality and equal opportunities to all countries in areas where resources have not yet been developed. The original text of this resolution will be sent to the British government, requesting that it convene this conference. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Former US Consul in Harbin Commits Suicide on the President Polk</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to today's announcement by the State Department, Hanson, former US Consul General in Harbin, shot himself on the President Polk ship and died of his injuries. Hanson, aged 52, studied civil engineering at Cornell University. He later joined the embassy and was assigned to China as a translator in 1909. He served successively in Shanghai, Yantai, Dalian, Niuzhuang, Tianjin, Shantou, Chongqing, Fuzhou, Harbin, and other ports. He was particularly familiar with the situation in the three northeastern provinces and was known as the "King of Manchuria." In 1931, he was promoted to Consul General in Harbin. In August of this year, he was transferred to Moscow. Shortly thereafter, he was ordered to go to Abyssinia. The State Department then believed that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute was becoming increasingly serious and sent someone familiar with East Africa to Abyssinia, while transferring Hanson to Salonika. It is now unknown what prompted him to kill himself on the ship. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador Trautmann Returns to Beiping</h3>

<h3>League of Nations Council Meeting: Italy Retains Freedom of Action; Britain Focuses on Facilitating Reconciliation; France Complies with Treaty Obligations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met this afternoon to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Italian representative Aloisi stated firmly that the Italian government retained complete freedom of action to adopt the necessary plans to secure its colonies. Other speakers included British representative Eden, French Prime Minister Laval, Abyssinian representative Professor Jidji, and Spanish representative Orrego. The Council met twice today and adjourned without a resolution. The date of the next meeting has not been set.</p>
<p>Eden spoke first, listing the proposals put forward at the Paris Tripartite Conference. He then announced in solemn tones that Britain would do its utmost to facilitate a peaceful resolution. Eden continued, stating that the British had tried in various ways to create a new international order to save mankind from the scourge of war. The mechanism for the new order established by the League of Nations Covenant was in Geneva. If its spirit still exists, the British will certainly not encounter failure. The British government is deeply aware of its responsibilities as a member of the League of Nations, and world opinion is now focused on the actions of the British government. The League of Nations is now encountering a test of its survival. If it cannot safely overcome this difficulty, its power will be greatly damaged. The collapse of the League of Nations and the disruption of the new international order will lead to a global catastrophe. There are no political or economic conflicts between Britain and Italy. Britain's main interests in Abyssinia have been clearly recognized by Italy. The British government is not concerned that these interests will no longer be respected. Britain is a member of the League of Nations and a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Britain has only been concerned about this so far. Therefore, Britain is responsible for using the League of Nations mechanism. If it can obtain the sincere cooperation of both parties to the dispute, it will not be impossible to achieve a peaceful resolution. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Laval followed Eden and declared that France absolutely adheres to the League of Nations Covenant. No country has tried harder for peace than France in the past. Taking last year's Saar question and the dispute between Hungary and Yugoslavia as examples, they were resolved through the sincere cooperation of France and the countries concerned. Laval also referred to the document that Italy will submit to the League of Nations. This document will be discussed in detail by the League of Nations. Finally, he declared that we should all abide by treaty obligations in the future, because we urgently need peace. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Aloisi then presented a lengthy document detailing the history of Italian-Abyssinian relations over the past fifty years. He stated that Italy has always treated Abyssinia with patience and fairness, but Abyssinia, also being a member of the League of Nations, has attempted to circumvent the 1928 Italian-Abyssinian treaty. Aloisi then cited various "acts of aggression" by Abyssinia, stating that Italy no longer trusts the Abyssinian government and cannot accept its declarations. If Abyssinia remains in the League of Nations and is treated equally with Italy, Italy will feel a deep sense of pain. The Italian government retains complete freedom of action to adopt the necessary plans to secure its colonies. The actions of the Abyssinian government are unworthy of being included among civilized nations. The Abyssinian government has not fulfilled its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant. Italy regrets having voted to allow Abyssinia to join the League of Nations.</p>
<p>After Aloisi's speech, the meeting was adjourned. In the evening, the meeting continued. Abyssinian representative Professor Jidji addressed the audience, stating that the Italian-Abyssinian arbitration and conciliation committee had cleared Abyssinia of responsibility for the Wal-Wal incident. The Abyssinian government sincerely wishes to reach a compromise with Italy. All the accusations against Abyssinia by Aloisi are fabricated. Abyssinia will soon present arguments to refute them in detail. At the same time, he wished to draw the audience's attention to the fact that Italy is now attempting to propose sanctions against a country that is acting within its sovereign rights, creating a "terrible precedent for the League of Nations."</p>
<p>Finally, Spanish representative Orrego spoke, firmly upholding the principles of the League of Nations Covenant. The League of Nations Council then adjourned, and the date of the next meeting has not been set. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>The Council meeting has attracted more attention than ever before. Not only has the number of representatives from various countries doubled, but the gallery is also packed with journalists, photographers, and the public. (National News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Continues to Refute Italy; Someone Will Invoke Article 15 of the Covenant</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is learned that when the League of Nations Council continues its meeting at 6:00 PM today, the Abyssinian representative will refute Italy's accusations against the Abyssinian government. Members will propose invoking Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. If so, a committee of five will be appointed to form a conciliation panel. According to the provisions of that article, the dispute should be submitted to the Council, which should endeavor to resolve it. If it cannot be resolved, the Council should issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Council considers fair and appropriate. British representative Eden met with French Prime Minister and Minister Laval for a very long time this morning, followed by a visit to the Danish representative. Eden invited Laval, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, and representatives from Poland, Turkey, Argentina, Australia, and other influential figures to dine together this afternoon, continuing to discuss matters on a broader basis. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italian Representative Talks About a Two-Pronged Approach; Free Action if Negotiations Fail</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Italian representative to the League of Nations Council Aloisi recently gave a statement to the press, criticizing the statements made by the representatives of various countries at the Council meeting this afternoon and defending the memorandum submitted by Italy. Judging from his tone, it seems that Italy is firmly determined to take action, but has not completely abandoned the path of reconciliation. Aloisi said, "Although Italy is participating in the work of the League of Nations, it refuses to discuss anything with Abyssinia, because we consider Abyssinia to be lawless. Currently, we do not want to withdraw from the League of Nations. The League of Nations Council will probably appoint a special committee to study Italy's memorandum and then decide whether to adopt or reject the conclusions of the Italian memorandum. In short, Italy is not asking to expel Abyssinia, but the League of Nations Council should decide for itself which country, Italy or Abyssinia, it should accommodate." When reporters asked what Italy's intentions were, Aloisi replied firmly, "There is no immediate danger at present, but if we are provoked by the other party, then it will be a different matter." However, Aloisi also stated that as long as the negotiations in Geneva continue, the hope for a peaceful resolution will not be extinguished. Referring to the proposals made by British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, he said, "Although Eden is confident that his proposals are generous, we consider them insufficient, because these proposals are not in line with our aspirations and the price of our sacrifices. Italy requested to occupy a superior political and economic position in Abyssinia at the Paris Tripartite Conference, but the British proposal can only grant us a semi-superior economic position. However, the question is whether this proposal is the beginning of talks or the end of negotiations." Finally, Aloisi answered reporters' questions, stating that Italy submitted a reservation when signing the Paris Non-Aggression Pact, excluding Africa. Therefore, Abyssinia is not bound by the Non-Aggression Pact. (Havas)</p>
<h3>Italian Government Submits Document to the League of Nations; Accuses Abyssinian Government of Four Points</h3>
<p>(Rome) The memorandum submitted by the Italian government to the League of Nations accuses the Abyssinian government of the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Abyssinia refuses to demarcate the border and occupies Italian territory through illegal acts.</p>
<p>(2) It attacks Italian diplomatic representatives on a daily basis.</p>
<p>(3) It continues to harm the lives and property of Italian residents in Abyssinia.</p>
<p>(4) It makes the same attacks on Italian Somaliland. The memorandum proves Italy's goodwill, stating that Italy has supplied Abyssinia with 4,000 rifles and 1 million bullets. The first batch was sold for 1.9 million lire, and the Abyssinian king still owes Italy 845,000 lire. It is contrary to the principles of justice and fairness for members of the League of Nations to abide by the rules of the League of Nations Covenant and coexist with another member state that violates treaty obligations and places itself outside of the treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Frequent Informal Contacts Among Representatives of Various Countries; Five-Nation Drafting Committee to Be Formed</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations Council decided to adjourn yesterday, it did not hold a meeting this morning, and it is unlikely to hold a meeting this afternoon. The next meeting will be held tomorrow, at which time the Abyssinian representative will respond to the memorandum submitted by the Italian representative. Although the Council did not hold a meeting this morning, representatives from various countries held important talks. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with British Minister Without Portfolio Eden and Italian representative Aloisi. Eden met with Australian representative Bruce and Danish representative Munch. Aloisi met with Turkish representative Aras and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. In addition, Eden invited Laval, Beck, Bruce, Argentine representative Genaci, the chairman of this Council meeting, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to have lunch together. It seems that the representatives discussed the issue of forming a five-nation subcommittee and instructing it to draft a conciliation plan. The members of this subcommittee should include Eden and Laval. It is expected that the Council will appoint them at the next meeting. Officials from Britain and France hope that the subcommittee can draft a resolution as soon as possible so that the situation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be clarified before the League of Nations General Assembly convenes. British Foreign Secretary Hoare is scheduled to arrive in Geneva on the 8th or 9th of this month to attend the first meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The date of the next Council meeting had not been decided by noon today. However, the representatives of the Council continued their talks this morning. Eden discussed with representatives of countries not affected by the Italian-Abyssinian issue, such as Spanish representative Oliver, Dutch Foreign Minister Mencio, and the Prime Minister of Hans. Some of the representatives wanted to express their opinions on the Italian-Abyssinian issue, so a short meeting will be held tonight or tomorrow morning. However, unless the Abyssinian representative can respond to the points of criticism in the Italian memorandum, it may be decided not to hold a meeting for the time being. The Italian memorandum is currently being studied by a small committee organized by the three major powers. The focus is on whether either party has violated international treaties. Other points, such as the Abyssinian representative's claim that Italy has no right to complain about Abyssinian internal affairs in Geneva, are set aside. (National News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>American Archaeologist Predicts War Will Not Last Past Winter; Italian Army Will Use Massacre as Tactics</h3>
<p>Posey. American archaeologist Barrow Locke told a Reuters reporter here today that Italian tactics have greatly changed since the Battle of Adwa. The people of Abyssinia may not know this. Future wars will be absolute massacres, and the war will not last beyond Christmas. Abyssinia is extremely rich in oil, has many mines, and has very promising agriculture. It is truly a country with endless treasures. Mussolini is willing to sacrifice everything to seize it. Barrow Locke recently conducted an investigation in Abyssinia and is now going to Abyssinia again with British Dr. Stanley to organize a Red Cross to serve the Abyssinian people. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is now believed that the Italian government will immediately announce a decision to continue building twelve destroyers. It is heard that the keels of several ships have already been laid. At the same time, an order will be issued to mobilize an army division, a Blackshirt division, and another Blackshirt division, which will be composed of those injured in the last war, students, and overseas Italian citizens. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to today's gazette, from January 1st to the end of July, a total of 130 Italian soldiers died in East Africa, including 14 officers and 79 newly enlisted soldiers. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. The League of Nations is now making a final effort to avert the disaster in East Africa, while Abyssinia's preparations for war are still proceeding step by step. Colonel Hubert Julian, a famous black aviator from Harlem, was appointed today as the commander-in-chief of the Addis Ababa garrison. A forward headquarters will be established there. Colonel Julian is a confidant of the Abyssinian king and is now training Abyssinians in the European way. He believes that all of Abyssinia's aircraft are not suitable for modern warfare, so he abandoned the air force and took a position in the army. At the same time, according to a senior Abyssinian military officer, weapons from the Addis Ababa armory are now being moved to various locations west of the capital to prevent enemy aircraft attacks. He also said that Italian aircraft will not be able to destroy anything of military value. The victims of aerial attacks will be civilians, and royal palaces and churches will also be targets of aircraft attacks. It was only revealed today that military supplies and bullets have been transported from Addis Ababa every night by mules and cargo trucks since the middle of last month. Residents are not allowed to go out after 7:30 PM every night, so their movements are extremely secret. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Meeting Shows Slight Increase in Hope; French and Italian Representatives Wear Joyful Expressions</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The outcome of today's meeting of the League of Nations Council has brought a slight increase in hope to the general public. The Council is expected to continue its public meetings on Friday or Saturday. Before that, the reporting committee will continue the League of Nations' efforts to find a solution to the dispute and will report any new proposals put forward by Britain or France. Laval and Aloisi both showed very joyful appearances. Aloisi told a guest tonight that he did not want to propose that Abyssinia be expelled from the League of Nations, but if other countries propose to reject it, then there can be a logical decision. If the League of Nations prefers Abyssinia and abandons Italy, then this matter is up to the League of Nations to decide, not Italy. As for what Italy calls "freedom of action," it refers to the freedom to withdraw from the League of Nations or declare war. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) All representatives of the League of Nations feel that the most important feature of today's meeting of the League of Nations Council is that the Council now clearly understands the vast special rights offered to Italy in the Paris Three-Power Conference. Many believe that Italy has so far underestimated the value of this offer and the public opinion that will be aroused after its rejection. The discussions made by everyone at the meeting today are enough to show that if Italy disregards the Covenant of the League of Nations, the League of Nations Council is determined to uphold it. The Little Entente, the Scandinavian countries, and Turkey all share the same opinion on upholding the Covenant, believing that this issue is a test for all future solutions.

<h3>Will Britain, France, and Italy Hold Another Meeting? To Be Held in Northern Italy to Allow Mussolini to Attend</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources believe that Britain, France, and Italy will hold a meeting in northern Italy to allow Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to personally attend and discuss the solutions to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute that Britain and France previously proposed at the Paris Conference, which were rejected by the Italian representative Aloisi. It is generally believed that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the British government are both willing to use every means to avoid war between Britain and Italy. This three-power meeting will be chaired by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and he will draft the details of the solutions previously proposed by Britain and France, so that Italy can give up the idea of war without damaging its reputation.

<h3>Roosevelt's Declaration: Dollar Diplomacy Abandoned Long Ago; Standard Oil Company Visits Prime Minister, Gives Up Oil Rights in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from the United States. President Roosevelt recently issued a declaration on the issue of Abyssinian oil concessions, saying, "The US government has not recognized 'dollar diplomacy' since March 4, 1933. Now that the Abyssinian oil concessions have been revoked, it is even more evident that dollar diplomacy has become a thing of the past." He also said that he and Secretary of State Hull had no concerns that the United States would be drawn into the Italian-Abyssinian dispute because its citizens had obtained concessions. What we feared was that the negotiations taking place in Geneva would suffer serious difficulties as a result. Now that the concessions have been revoked, this move will certainly help the negotiations currently underway in Geneva. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news here today, Standard Oil Company Chairman Walter Teagle and Vice President Dundas voluntarily visited Secretary of State Hull to inform him that the company had obtained oil concession rights in Abyssinia. The State Department was not aware of the contents of this matter beforehand. It is believed here that after the company gave up the oil rights, it has placed the United States outside the vortex of the East African dispute. Some quarters speculate that the Abyssinian Emperor may offer the same privileges to Italy in order to avoid war. It is also possible that Japanese private entrepreneurs may be interested in operating it. (National Telegram, 4th)</p>

<h3>Record of Inspection of Disaster Conditions on the Rivers</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>Account of Flood Prevention at Liuzhuang on the South Bank of the Yellow River</p>
<p>Departing from Kaifeng, we headed to the breaches of the Yellow River that were wreaking havoc in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. Accompanying us were Li Wenzhai from the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, Zhou Baipeng, a representative of the disaster victims in western Shandong, Liu Bingzhong, a Yellow River flood control inspector from the Economic Commission, and Secretary Wang from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. We rode in two cars, leaving the north gate early in the morning. The city defense sandbags were neatly stacked. Crossing the moat embankment, the green willows along the roadside were lush and provided cool shade. The fields had slight accumulations of rainwater, but there was no major damage. We reached the Yellow River embankment and turned east along the embankment road. The embankment was about thirty feet wide, with green willows like curtains on both sides. The cars moved quickly and smoothly, with very little bumps. To the north of the embankment were river beaches, and to the south were flatlands, all planted with sorghum and soybeans, which were ripening like clouds. The river was still several miles away from the embankment, and the crops had dense ears and leaves. Thus, after traveling for hundreds of miles, we still couldn't see the rushing river. However, the beach land was higher than the flatland, usually by about twenty feet. The beach land was gradually silting up, and the flatland was becoming lower and more depressed. The dangerous situation for the future is already apparent to anyone, even without intelligence. From now on, unless we actually plant forests extensively in the upstream provinces to regulate the climate and rainfall, and reduce the amount of mud and sand in the river, merely knowing how to raise the embankments and empty talk about dredging will not bring peaceful days to the river's flood season, just as the river itself will never be clear.</p>
<p>The car arrived at Kaocheng County, on the border of eastern Henan. The embankment road was difficult to travel, so we detoured through the flatlands. The reporter and Mr. Li and Mr. Zhou rode together in the first car. The driver was unfamiliar with the route. When we entered Caoxian County in Shandong, we realized we had taken a wrong turn. We wanted to retrace the tracks of Secretary Wang's car, but we thought it would be too far out of the way, and the gasoline was running low. We were deeply worried about breaking down halfway. Mr. Li, who was from Caoxian, estimated the distance with the remaining fuel and decided to go to Heze (Caozhou) first to buy gasoline, and then turn to Dongzhuangkoumen. Everyone agreed to go. The roads were mostly in the fields, winding and narrow, only convenient for people to walk, not suitable for cars. The view was obscured by the mist, making it difficult to tell directions. We would call out "Erge" to anyone we met to ask for directions. But we still took the wrong turn several times, and the car wheels were deeply stuck in the mud. Here, the common form of address is to respectfully call people "Erge." If you call someone "Dage," you will be considered to be insulting them. The weak will give you a disdainful look, and the strong will curse back at you. This is because calling someone "Dage" seems to imply that they are like Wu Da (a weak and cuckolded character), so they get very angry. Calling someone "Erge" is like respecting them for having the chivalry of Wu Song (a strong and heroic character), so they are happy. If southerners travel to the north and are not used to calling people "Erge," and insist on calling themselves "Laoda," then it is best to call people "Laoxiang." This is the most common term of address in the three provinces of Hebei (actually still called Zhili), Shandong, and Henan.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Heze, we went straight to the county government. The county magistrate was out inspecting the disaster. We met with the section chiefs and others and learned that the county covers an area of more than 1.4 million mu and has a population of more than 434,000 people. The Yellow River passes through the county for about forty li. This time, the breach at Dongzhuang affected the county, with the disaster area accounting for more than half of the entire county. Nearly 400 villages were flooded, and the number of disaster victims reached more than half of the population. The property loss was estimated at more than 3 million yuan. More than 200 villages north of the Qili River, such as Yanshikou, were particularly severely affected. However, compared to the neighboring counties of Juancheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Dongping, and Yutai, the situation was still secondary. However, because the entire disaster area is too large, local self-reliance is really beyond their capabilities. They hope for government relief, but it is mostly empty promises. The life and death of millions of disaster victims depend on whether people in society can show great compassion.</p>
<p>The Heze County Magistrate and section chiefs were mostly old acquaintances of Commissioner Li. They offered us a simple meal and sent a police officer to guide us. We continued our journey, heading northwest for more than twenty li to a place called Xinzhuang, which was still forty li from the breach. The sun was already setting, and the autumn breeze was refreshing, so we accelerated to get to our destination. Unexpectedly, the car was suddenly trapped in the mud. We asked people to push it or hired oxen to pull it. We got out of one mudflat only to get stuck in another. Finally, the electricity was overused, and the mechanism suddenly caught fire, burning out the ammeter and making it unusable. We then had oxen pull the car back to Heze City. The reporter and others continued on foot, reaching Hejiazhuang six li away. It was getting dark. We met Mr. He, Commissioner Li's middle school teacher, who welcomed us warmly, offering us melon and tea. We learned that the village was densely populated and had little land. In the past, land prices were high, with the best land selling for more than a hundred yuan per mu. Now, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, there is no money to cultivate, and land prices have plummeted to around forty yuan, and there is still a tendency to decline further. Fluctuations in land prices are not surprising, but in the peaceful area of Shandong, good land is actually without funds for cultivation and is in danger of being abandoned. This is not only a bad omen for the current society going its own way but also a prelude to the natural exposure of the weaknesses of the current society. We must not take it lightly.</p>
<p>In the cool night, we said goodbye to Mr. He and set off. Four of us (Commissioner Li brought an attendant) each rode in a small cart, moving forward in a row. Shandong small carts have small wheels hidden under the cargo platform. One person leads the cart with a rope in front, and another person pushes hard from behind. The passenger lies on their back on the cargo platform, which is less tiring than sitting sideways. But in the dark, groping, and with rivers and ditches crisscrossing, we often could not bypass them. Then four people pushed one cart together, wading through the water. The water was knee-deep. Sometimes, fish bumped into our feet, which we thought were undoubtedly from the breach. The so-called "approaching the abyss in the dark night" was truly frightening. Going down a small slope, Commissioner Li</p>

<p>'s cart suddenly overturned, throwing him to the ground. Everyone was shocked. Previously, when the car was stuck in the mud, while pushing and pulling with all his might, Mr. Zhou had been sprayed by oil fumes. The driver extinguished the electric fire, burning both hands. The reporter's right finger was also inadvertently caught in the car door, and he could not write for several days. Now that the car has overturned again, we were very alarmed. Fortunately, there were no major injuries, and we could still continue our journey. Otherwise, those who came to inspect the disaster situation might have been inspected by others instead. The severity of the disaster caused by Feng Yi (god of the Yellow River) is truly beyond description in a few words. Even indirect and minor effects are so shocking. It is no wonder that those who are directly hit by the disaster sweep across dozens of counties and flood tens of thousands of people. The tragic situation is beyond human imagination, and I cannot bear to continue speaking of it.</p>
<p>At midnight, the crescent moon rose in the east. We saw farmers guarding watermelon fields and sorghum fields. We learned that we were near the river embankment and that disaster victims often came and went. If the sorghum was not well guarded, it would be stolen. Later, we reached a village gathering and knocked on the door to buy noodles to fill our stomachs. One silver dollar was exchanged for 5,000 cash. Only copper coins worth 20 cash each were used. Copper coins worth 200 or 100 cash each, which were used in Kaifeng, were not accepted in Shandong. After eating, we tried to pay, but they could not make change for a silver dollar, and they would not accept large copper coins. The lack of a unified currency is also an obstacle to travel. Later, we arrived at a certain public office where a militia team was stationed. There was a telephone that could connect to the Shandong River Affairs Bureau office in Dongzhuang, which was twenty li away. We telephoned them and asked them to send a car to pick us up at dawn. The clock had already struck four, and we were exhausted. We borrowed a place to rest and wait for dawn. From Hejiazhuang to here, we traveled for a total of eight hours, covering a distance of only twenty li. The obstruction of the flood and the winding paths can be imagined.</p>
<p>The next morning, Secretary Wang received the news and first sent a car from Huangzhuang to pick us up. After meeting, he introduced us to Lin Danzhen, the section chief of the fourth section of the South Bank of the Hebei Provincial River Affairs Bureau, who gave us a detailed account of the flood prevention work of that section. The three provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Hebei are located in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Since the breach at Tongwaxiang in Henan Province in the fifth year of Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty was not blocked, it became the sixth major change of the Yellow River and the day when the Yellow River disaster returned to southern Hebei. Recently, Chinese and foreign experts have identified Liuzhuang as the most dangerous section in the three provinces. The area is located between Dongming and Puyang in Hebei Province and Heze in Shandong Province. If a disaster occurs on the southern border, the damage to Hebei Province would be limited to a dozen or so villages in Dongming and Puyang, while western Shandong would bear the brunt, with ten prefectures of Caozhou, and the counties in northern Jiangsu and northwestern Anhui would also be within the scope of the flooding, especially the Huai River basin would be the most affected. Therefore, it is said that diverting the Huai River without controlling the Yellow River is not a fundamental solution. I (Lin said himself) was transferred to Liuzhuang in the winter of the 18th year of the Republic (1929) to block the breach (in the autumn of the 18th year, a breach occurred west of Huangzhuang about four kilometers from Liuzhuang). After the work was completed, I stayed to guard the dangerous works at Liuzhuang. It has been seven years. Initially, the dangerous works at Liuzhuang were nearly two thousand meters long, with one hundred and eight sections of weirs (a type of embankment work). Fortunately, the local people in Caozhou were not only pained by the continuous Yellow River disasters but also aware that the Hebei Province had cut staff and reduced expenses in river affairs, and the repair and guarding of dangerous works would become increasingly difficult. They then formed a River Works Promotion Association, raised large sums of money, purchased and transported stone materials, and, under the supervision of this section, built six stone dams of various sizes, and the embankment gradually became stable. Later, because the purchase and transportation of stone materials was far away in Gongxian County, Henan Province, five hundred li away, which was time-consuming and costly, we advocated using replacement stones. However, the brick bodies were easy to float, so we also wove them into square cages with lead wire to fill them, which are called brick cages, to replace straw and build brick dams or protective edges. This has proven to be a lasting solution. However, this year, Hebei Province lacked funds for construction, and the flood control funds have not been issued at all. There is a severe shortage of stored materials. When the first major flood arrived on July 9, the water level was 5 centimeters higher than in 1933. Fortunately, we had received a report from the Yellow River Conservancy Association Tongshan Watermark Station, so we were able to prepare in advance. All the soldiers were mobilized and patrolled day and night for three consecutive days and nights without sitting or lying down. We discovered a total of thirteen large and small leaks, which were blocked with great effort, and none of them became a disaster. This can also be said to be lucky. The second flood occurred from August 8th to 10th. The water level in the above sections was higher than the first time, but this section was 1 centimeter lower than the first time. This is because Linpu is close to this section, and the river flow is shallower and faster due to its back-river depression and faster flow. However, the flow rate was extremely fast, which was rare. The weirs were greatly affected. Fourteen or five days ago, we were adding compartments and hanging weirs to the weirs, but there was not enough material, resulting in twelve weirs not being added to the full height. The director of the River Affairs Bureau personally rushed to supervise and urge, but the materials were all bought from the villagers. Since the flood control funds had not been issued at all, there was no way to purchase materials to deal with the emergency, so dangerous situations occurred frequently. Fortunately, we received the news early and piled up stone bricks and sacks, and the highest water level only lasted for half a day, and then it dropped by 8 centimeters, so we were able to turn danger into safety again. It is estimated that in this month or so, this section used more than 4.5 million catties of pile material, more than 2,000 rough hemp ropes, 8,000 oak trees, and more than 20,000 man-days for the first major flood, which rose by 2 meters and 3 centimeters. The second major flood rose by 2 meters and 2 centimeters. If there is another flood after autumn, we should still try our best to prevent it, etc.</p>
<h3>Li Yizhi Advocates Digging Embankments and Causes Repercussions - People of the Hetao Area Sincerely State the Dangers of Digging Embankments and Telegraph the Government to Continue Blocking the Breaches According to Plan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - On July 10, the Yellow River breached at Dongzhuang, Juancheng, flooding western Shandong and affecting northern Jiangsu. At the beginning of the breach, Juancheng, fearing that the river water would seep east, built an embankment between the Li Shengtun people's embankment and the Linpu Jida Dike, called the Ge Dike. Later, the shape of the breach changed, and the main flow rolled east, and the remaining dike collapsed completely, approaching the Ge Dike. The people in the Hetao area were extremely worried and rushed to repair another people's embankment behind the Ge Dike day and night, called the Retreat Dike. In the past two months, the successive major floods in the Hetao area have depended on the power of this Ge Dike to prevent more than one million lives and tens of millions of properties in the five counties of Juancheng, Yuncheng, Fanxian, Shouchang, and Yangsha from being swept away. Now, Li Yizhi, a member of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, believes that the situation of the Yellow River's southward attack is serious and has asked the National Economic Commission to telegraph the Provincial Government of this province, strictly ordering the area around Juancheng to harvest the sorghum within five days, dig up the people's embankments in Juancheng, release water into the Hetao area, and re-enter the main river from Huanghuasi, in order to reduce the disaster situation in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government submitted it to the Provincial Government's Political Affairs Meeting for discussion yesterday (the 3rd), and it was resolved to submit it to the breach plugging committee for a reply.</p>
<p>The people of the Hetao area were very alarmed when they read in the newspaper that Li Yizhi had proposed the method of digging up the embankments. The representatives of the various counties in the Hetao area who were in Jinan petitioning for relief held a meeting at the Dingxin Company on Xiaocang Street yesterday and decided to telegraph the central government to withdraw the order, and went to the Provincial Government to petition, expressing their opposition. The general idea is that digging up the people's embankments to divert water back to the river, sacrificing a few to protect the majority in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu, was also a relief method at the beginning of the breach. However, the breach has been open for nearly two months, and the river channel outside the breach has been scoured deep. Even if the people's embankments are dug up, the water flowing east into the Hetao area may be very small, and dozens of villages in western Shandong have already become disaster areas. How can we bear to let this corner of dry land in the Hetao area suffer the same catastrophe? The people of the Hetao area vow to oppose this method to the death. Chairman Han sent Zhang Yue, a member of the Provincial Committee, to meet with them on his behalf. After the representatives stated their reasons, Zhang replied that the method of digging up the embankments was not Chairman's idea, but a central government order, and that everyone's opinions would be conveyed to the Chairman. The representatives then went to the River Affairs Bureau to petition, where they were met by Zhao Luren, the head of the General Affairs Section, on behalf of the Director. The representatives stated the same reasons as before. Zhao said that the River Affairs Bureau would obey the order and could not make any claims. Everyone's opinions would be reported to the Director. The representatives then left. (September 4)</p>
<h3>Amoy Customs and Japanese Consulate Conclude an Agreement on the Import of Goods by Taiwanese</h3>
<p>Long-Standing Difficulties Can Be Resolved - The Agreement Takes Effect Upon Signing</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence - The conflicts and disputes between the Xiamen Customs and the Taiwanese over the inspection of imported goods from Taiwan have been a very difficult and serious matter for the Xiamen Customs for many years. There is a type of passenger in Fujian Province who carries goods on the ship, called "water passenger." Two ships arrive from Taiwan every week, and each ship often has 700 to 1,000 passengers. Half or more of these passengers carry goods hidden in their luggage carts. Since there are many people, and they rely on their Japanese citizenship, they have a special background and amulet, making it extremely difficult for customs officers to inspect. It often takes a whole day to inspect one ship, which is also extremely difficult for ordinary travelers. The Taiwanese often take advantage of this complicated and difficult situation to evade customs duties. The customs inspection becomes stricter and stricter, and there are repeated crackdowns. The Taiwanese hate the customs officers more and more deeply. Conflicts and disputes, customs officers being beaten, and Taiwanese gathering to forcibly take back confiscated goods from the customs have occurred frequently. The loss of national taxes is even more difficult to calculate, because Xiamen is the largest port for the import of Japanese goods, and textiles and groceries are often brought in by these water passengers. Sometimes, the disputes escalate, and the commissioner of customs temporarily asks the Japanese consul to send personnel to the ship to suppress them, but this is rarely effective. Therefore, the commissioner of customs of the Xiamen Customs has been negotiating with the Japanese consul for a long time to resolve the problem of Taiwanese water passengers carrying goods. Recently, Customs Commissioner K.D. Ardeshir of the Xiamen Customs and Yoshiro Yamada, the Japanese Consul stationed in Xiamen, concluded an agreement, in which the Taiwanese water passengers jointly formed a trade association to control the transportation of goods by the water passengers, and the association is responsible. The agreement was signed on August 29 and took effect on the same day. The long-standing problem of disputes and difficulties has fortunately been resolved. The full text of the agreement is as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for the Management of the Small Package Export Merchants Association The Japanese Consul in Xiamen and the Commissioner of Customs of the Xiamen Customs have consulted and agreed on the following measures for the management of the Small Package Export Merchants Association coming to and from Xiamen and Keelung: Article 1: Each Keelung-Xiamen ship shall be limited to 300 members of the Association. Article 2: Each member shall wear the badge issued by the Association and carry a certificate. Article 3: Each member shall be allowed to carry up to four packages. Article 4: The volume of each package shall be limited to four talents (one talent is one cubic foot), and each package shall be affixed with a label stating the member's name and the number of the package. Article 5: Of the four packages carried by the member, two shall be stored in the cargo hold when leaving Keelung and shall be moved to the Xiamen luggage inspection office upon arrival in Xiamen to pay taxes. The other two packages may be inspected and taxed on the ship, but the value of each package, calculated according to the tax price estimated by the Xiamen Customs, shall not exceed 75 Xiamen silver dollars. If the value exceeds this amount, the package shall be moved to the luggage inspection office to pay taxes. As for the cases where customs officers, members, and representatives cannot agree on the price and type of goods, the matter shall be handled in accordance with this article. The packages carried by the members shall be properly separated from the luggage carried by genuine passengers. If they are deliberately mixed or hidden in various places on the ship, they may be confiscated in accordance with the regulations. The packages taxed on the ship shall be inspected only after the passenger luggage inspection is completed. Article 6: The representative of the Association shall promptly submit a detailed list of the number of packages carried by the members and the price and volume of each package to the customs officers for inspection when the ship enters the port. Article 7: Each time a ship enters the port, the Association shall send two representatives to be fully responsible for the actions of the members and to assist customs officers in inspection matters. Article 8: For taxable packages carried by passengers who are not members of the Association, except for a small number of items belonging to genuine passengers, they shall be submitted to the ship's crew for inclusion in the hatch manifest before the ship arrives in the port of Xiamen. Otherwise, once discovered, they may be confiscated by the Customs. Article 9: In order to ensure the effective implementation of these rules, the Japanese Consulate in Xiamen shall send a fixed number of personnel to the ship each time a Keelung ship enters the port to prevent members and non-members from having disputes with customs officers and to make every effort to assist customs officers and member representatives in resolving other issues. Article 10: The Association shall bear full responsibility for any cases involving customs officers, regardless of whether the incident occurs on the ship or elsewhere. Article 11: This agreement is of a trial nature and may be revised or repealed if necessary. (September 1)</p>
<h3>The Fujian-Zhejiang Border Area is About to Begin Suppressing Bandits - The Deployment of Various Armies is Ready</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence - Since the establishment of the General Headquarters for the Suppression of Bandits in the Fujian-Jiangxi-Anhui-Zhejiang Border Area, it has been very active in carrying out military operations to suppress bandits on the Fujian-Zhejiang border. According to military sources, the military operations to suppress bandits in the Fujian-Zhejiang border area have been deployed and various troops have successively arrived at the designated defense lines and begun the general offensive. However, the two bandit gangs of Su Yu and Liu Ying, fearing that they would be trapped in a desperate situation once the blockade was completed, are now trying their best to break through. As a result, the counties of Chougning, Fuding, Longquan, and Qingyuan have been heavily disturbed by bandits in recent days. In addition, a gang of Red bandits from the pseudo-101st Regiment, numbering about 500 to 600, has been discovered in the area where the three counties of Yongan, Ninyang, and Datian in northern Fujian meet, using Xu Keng as their base of operations and causing trouble everywhere. The day before yesterday, they were attacked by Yang Zuoyuan's regiment sent by Lu Xingrong's division, and the bandit forces were unsustainable. Yesterday, they telegraphed that they had entered the deep mountains of Datian. Yang's regiment has advanced to the entrance and plans to encircle the gang. As for the Big Sword Society in the counties of Nanping, Shunchang, Jianou, and Pingnan in northern Fujian, riots have been occurring daily, and they have repeatedly kidnapped gentlemen and extorted money and rice in various places. After the army's vigorous suppression, they have also been slightly pacified. The largest meeting place was in Wangtai, Nanping, which was also destroyed by the army. (September 4)</p>
<h3>Songjiang - Aiming Town Opens Land Registration</h3>
<p>Land registration in this county, the first district, Fengbian Town, has already begun. Starting on the 5th of this month, it is the registration period for Aiming Town, with a deadline of the 15th. Registration fees can be paid when the certificate is issued. If it is overdue, once the Land Bureau sends personnel to supervise, the registration fee will be collected immediately before registration. County Magistrate Jin believes that land registration is related to property rights and should be widely publicized. Therefore, on the 5th, he convened the chief of each bao in Aiming to talk. Zhang Baosong, a land inspector from the Provincial Committee, and He Menglei, the section chief of the bureau, also attended to explain the relationship between registration and land. As a result of the talks, each chief of the bao is responsible for convening the chief of each jia to convey the meaning of registration.</p>
<h3>Jiading, Investigation into the Two Committee Members' Handling of a Homicide Case</h3>
<p>Last month, on the 7th, the County Government received a report from Zhang Qi, the squadron leader of the Anting Security Team, stating that during a search at Zhou Weizhong's residence in the town for illegal opium smoking, they apprehended Chen Ke. While being escorted, the suspect attempted to escape by jumping into the river and drowned. Magistrate Xu immediately dispatched an autopsy examiner to investigate, who concluded it was a case of drowning. The family of the deceased, however, alleged that the deceased was actually Chen Banghan, a visitor at Zhou Weizhong's house. They claimed that Squadron Leader Zhang forcibly accused him of illegal opium smoking and dragged him away. During the escort, the deceased argued with Zhang, who allegedly beat him to death and then disposed of the body in the river, falsely reporting the name as Chen Ke. The County Government only sent one autopsy examiner, and despite numerous injuries on the back of the body and the absence of mud under the fingernails, the examiner still concluded it was a case of drowning, leading to public outcry. Upon learning of this, the County Government sent Zhu, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, to persuade the family, but without success. Although police officers placed the body in a coffin, the family refused to claim it. The coffin was placed in the playground of the town's central primary school, where 500 to 600 students attended. Principal Ma Zhenhai, concerned about the decaying body posing a public health hazard, requested the County Government to move it. On the 29th of last month, the County Government sent police to move the body to a remote field. However, the family hired people to carry it back to the original location. Chen Youfeng, the deceased's uncle, currently works at the Examination Yuan, and Chen Youheng, another uncle, is a secretary at the Ministry of War Industry. Upon hearing of the incident, they filed a lawsuit according to the law and requested the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs and the Provincial Security Department to conduct a thorough investigation. Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government, upon learning of the situation, reportedly telegraphed Magistrate Xu to conduct a thorough investigation. On the 3rd of this month, the Provincial Security Department sent committee member Wang Lei, and the Department of Civil Affairs sent committee member Bu Guanlun, to jointly investigate the case in the county. At 3 PM, they interrogated Zhang Qi, the detained squadron leader of the Security Team, and police officers Ji Yuanliang and Chen Xuntong. They also summoned Chen Youheng, the deceased's family member, Shen Jiaji, the town mayor, and Xiang Jing Gu Fushan, to conduct separate interrogations. According to the police officers' testimony, the deceased was wearing clothes when apprehended, but the body was found completely naked. This point was of particular interest to Committee Members Wang and Jiang. The interrogation concluded at 6 PM, and a re-examination was ordered. Committee Members Wang and Jiang left Xiyi and returned to town that evening.</p>
<h3>Provincial Police Department Investigates Dereliction of Duty Case</h3>
<p>In August of last year, Wu Zexing, a patrol officer at the Nanxiang Public Security Substation, seized over a hundred taels of opium from a local vendor, Wang Zhangshi. He was accused of privately embezzling the opium and accepting 300 yuan in bribes, leading to his suspension and transfer to the Zhenjiang Garrison Headquarters. After a year, on the 31st of last month, Zeng Yi, a military judge from the Garrison Headquarters, came to Jiading to conduct a detailed investigation at the County Government Public Security Bureau and the Nanxiang District Office. He returned to Zhenjiang on September 1st.</p>
<h3>Ji Xiang Steamer Reduces Prices to Compete</h3>

<h3>Kunshan, Rice Stem Borer Disaster Spreads Throughout the County</h3>
<p>This county suffered a severe drought last year, causing great hardship to farmers. This year, during rice transplanting, they were fortunate to receive some rainfall, and subsequently, the rainfall was even. The farmers were all delighted, but just as the rice was about to flower, rice stem borers suddenly appeared in various villages. , , cut off the supply, turning the ripening rice gray. Upon seeing this situation, the farmers reported to the district offices to investigate. After each district chief reported to the county , a district chief meeting was convened on the 29th of last month. Regarding the affected fields, the Baojia heads were ordered to investigate the extent of the damage household by household before September 15th, fill out the forms, and report to the county, pending submission to the province for review and record. Recently, the rice stem borer infestation has been spreading. On the 3rd, seven or eight hundred farmers from the seventh district, each holding a bundle of dead rice, went to the county to make a clamorous protest. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, over a thousand farmers from the first district, each carrying dead rice, went to the County Government to request officials to go to the villages to investigate. County Magistrate Peng Baichuan went to the main hall and announced the above-mentioned investigation method to the crowd, and offered some comfort. The farmers were satisfied and left. The County Government is now ordering each district to find ways to prevent the spread of rice stem borers in order to reduce the suffering of the farmers.</p>
<h3>Zhengyi Village Robbery and Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Fuma Tang Village, about three li north of Zhengyi Town in the county, is located on the shore of Tu Yang Cheng Lake, an area where lake bandits frequently appear. Around 2 AM the other night, two bandit ships arrived at the village, carrying over a dozen bandits, each armed with long and short firearms. After landing, they broke into the houses of Wang Chuanxiang and Wang Huosheng and robbed them, forcing the victims to reveal the location of their hidden silver, but to no avail. They beat Wang Chuanxiang and left. Then, they went to Zhu Xingqing's house and robbed him, obtaining a lot of silver and clothes. Before leaving, they kidnapped Zhu's son, A'ta (12 years old), and took him aboard the ship, sailing towards Yangcheng Lake. Yesterday morning, the victims reported the robbery to the Zhengyi Public Security Bureau, which in turn reported it to the County Bureau. Upon receiving the report, Bureau Chief Zhang Da immediately led detectives in a car to investigate and inquired about the circumstances of the robbery. After returning to the bureau, he ordered Zhang Ruifu, the head of the detective team, to select capable detectives to investigate and apprehend the escaped bandits and rescue the hostage.</p>
<h3>Suzhou, Supervisor Ding Secretly Investigates Dispute over Fence Demolition</h3>
<p>The officials and police of Wu County and Wujiang County were ordered to dismantle the seventy shares of embankment around Taihu Lake. County Magistrate Xu of Wujiang County believed that the security team of Wu County had overstepped its boundary by suppressing the area and disrupting local order, and requested the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office to conduct a thorough investigation. In order to understand the true situation, Supervisor Ding specially sent two committee members, Chen Kan and Guo Hongzhong, to Suzhou to conduct a secret investigation. After arriving in Suzhou, Chen and Guo went to Wujiang under assumed names to conduct an on-site investigation. The investigation has been completed, and they left Suzhou yesterday to return to the province to report.</p>
<h3>Passenger Arrested for Carrying Poisonous Substances</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th) at 3 AM, when the Beijing-Shanghai train arrived at the Suzhou station, a passenger looked flustered. The railway police approached him for questioning, and he immediately ran towards Qian Wanli Bridge. He was intercepted by the Third and Fourth Precincts of the Public Security Bureau. They found a large bag of white powder, a small bag of red powder, and a bottle of saccharin on his person, which are raw materials for making red pills. He identified himself as Li Dexin. After being taken to the Third Precinct, he was then transferred to the Suzhou-Songjiang First Section Police Department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to be interrogated in Shanghai by the Lianglu Administration.</p>

<h3>Discussing the Construction of a Ring Road around the City</h3>
<p>The roads of Suzhou City were built 30 years ago, and the road surface is damaged. Now, with the completion of various highways, there is a constant flow of traffic. The Construction Bureau plans to levy one-tenth of the ticket price from various motor vehicle roads as a road fee to repair the ring road. A detailed plan has now been drafted and submitted for approval.</p>
<h3>Changshu, A Bountiful Autumn Harvest Expected This Year</h3>
<p>The rice and cotton crops in this county have suffered for years, leading to a significant decrease in income. This summer, the rainfall has been favorable, and the rice fields are developing well. There was a previous outbreak of locusts, but it was only partial, and the losses were minimal. A bountiful autumn harvest is expected this year. During a previous meeting with the district chiefs, they were instructed to investigate the color of the autumn harvest in each village in advance to set standards for future inspections of the autumn harvest. According to the villagers, the rice fields are currently growing ears of grain and are in excellent condition. If the weather does not change, the autumn harvest is expected to be over 90%, making it one of the most abundant harvests in recent years.</p>
<h3>Only Son Murdered for Money</h3>
<p>A case of murdering an only son for money was discovered one day in Qianjia Zhaiji, Fourth District of this county. The incident was bizarre. It has been reported to the county. The county sent an autopsy examiner to the village on the 4th to examine the body. Lu Nannan, a farmer in Qianjia Zhaiji, passed away two years ago, leaving behind a wife and a son named Rongxing, who is now twelve years old. His mother adored him because he was an orphan, and the family had savings, so Rongxing wore many ornaments, which led to disaster. On the 30th of last month, Rongxing went out to play and did not return by night. There was no news the next day either. Although detectives were sent out, they could not find him. His mother was very anxious. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 2nd, a person named Lu reported that Rongxing's body had been found in the reed flower river in Tang Ni Wan. His mother went to identify the body, and it was indeed her beloved son. She mourned loudly while holding the body. All the rings and other ornaments on the body were gone. The abdomen was not swollen, indicating that he had been murdered and then dumped into the river. She immediately took the body home and reported it to the county government through the Public Security Bureau for examination.</p>
<h3>Wuxi, Rice and Bean Traders Make Second Petition</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Tooth Guild collecting temporary business tax on wheat from merchants, the rice, bean, and miscellaneous grain industries, citing difficulties in handling and non-compliance with laws, had previously appointed over 130 representatives from the entire industry in the Eighth Section to petition the County Government Business Tax Bureau. They also telegraphed the ministry, province, and the Judicial Yuan to request an explanation and requested that the order be rescinded. Xia Zhenlong, the director of the Business Tax Bureau, stated that the Xixi area was being handled under orders, and the interpretation of relevant laws was clear. Now that doubts have arisen and difficulties have been expressed, they can only wait for the provincial order to handle it. At the same time, he also stated that the rice industry owes more than 10,000 yuan in business tax for the 22nd and 23rd years, which should be paid as soon as possible, otherwise, they would have to report to the province for collection. The rice industry has now successively allocated payments for the owed taxes. However, the flour mills, because the Business Tax Bureau had ordered them to copy and report the numbers and collect taxes, but the wheat flour is subject to unified tax, should follow the ministry's orders and, starting this month, directly handle wheat directly with the merchants without buying or selling in the industry. The Shanghai Fuxin Qifeng and other flour mills have even submitted the wheat transportation permits they received directly to the Department of Finance to show that they will no longer purchase wheat. The rice shops believe that this move will lead to the death of the rice industry. Therefore, yesterday (the 5th), they appointed more than ten representatives, including Xie Weihan, to contact the Chamber of Commerce and then make a second petition to the Business Tax Bureau. Because Director Jin was absent from the province to attend the Provincial Business Tax Bureau Director's Conference, staff member Zhang met with them, promised to forward their intentions, and facilitate the handling.</p>
<h3>Nantong, Special Training for All County Baochang</h3>

Yesterday, Judge Li of the court held a hearing and sentenced the criminals. Jiang Liansheng was sentenced to seven years in prison, and Ding Fengshan was sentenced to five years in prison. They were sent to prison to serve their sentences.</p>
<h3>Infant Home Improves Infant Care Methods</h3>
<p>County Magistrate County Magistrate, previously because the Jiangdu Infant Home had failed to effectively care for infants, resulting in many deaths, ordered Xu Tingsong, the director of the home, to actively improve the situation. The director went to infant care facilities in Beijing and Shanghai to conduct inspections and learn from them. He believed that the infant care methods in the cities were more complete. After returning to Yangzhou, he drafted an improvement plan and submitted it to the hospital for review. He also hired Gao Mei, an experienced nanny, to the home to plan everything. It is reported that the first step in the home's improvement plan is to select the stronger infants and place them in a well-ventilated area, providing artificial nutrition. They also selected ten larger infants from the large infant department to serve as caretakers. It is hoped that after the improvement by Nanny Gao, infant mortality will be reduced.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou, Xianliang Township Robbed</h3>
<p>Xianliang Township (formerly known as Shili Jian Town) in the Second District of this county was suddenly attacked by bandit ships at around 2 AM tonight (the 3rd). The bandits first fired shots as a show of force, then went to the house of Qian Xiwu, the head of the postal sub-office, and robbed him of cash and clothes. They then robbed door to door in the town, looting for an hour before escaping on their original ships with the loot. The total loss is estimated to be over a thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Pinghu, Embezzlement by Collection Director Discovered</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance, concerned that the delay in the disaggregation of field taxes in this county was greatly affecting the national and provincial taxes, as well as the provincial military supplies, sent a committee member to the county to oversee the collection. Yesterday, it was discovered that Collection Director Ma Biru had embezzled a significant amount from the field taxes over the years. County Magistrate Zhang Zhouwen immediately signed a warrant and sent the director to be pursued for the money. Peng Shouzhai, Yu Yongba, Li Gonghao, and Zhou Zhong, collection staff who were found to be ineffective in collecting taxes, were all summoned and reprimanded. It is reported that the Department of Finance has sent personnel who must collect and remit 80,000 yuan in the near future.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou, Repair of the Seawall Dams on the Qiantang River</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the flood season in early June, the dams at Numbers 84, 91, and 94 on the north bank of the Qiantang River have shown signs of damage. The stones have been washed away, the dam foundations have been broken, and the river is approaching the riverbank. The Water Conservancy Bureau estimates that 28,000 cubic meters of stone will be needed, and the total cost for the three dams will be over 56,000 yuan. The report has been submitted to the Construction Department for approval to repair Dams 91 and 94 first. The construction costs will be covered by the emergency relief fund. Dam 84 is severely damaged, and further investigation and reporting have been ordered to raise funds for repairs.</p>

<h3>The Flood Relief Association Actively Raises Relief Funds</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, this year's flood is severe, and refugees are everywhere. Although the disaster relief efforts from all parties are not insignificant, they are like a drop in the bucket and do not help. It is necessary for everyone to work together to provide emergency relief in order to achieve effective results. Recently, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Shuyong, Xun Yanfang, Zhang Weiru, Mu Ouchu, Li Dachao, and others, the leaders and deputy leaders of the fundraising group of the Shanghai Provincial Flood Relief Association, have sent letters to various public organizations and various industries and businesses in Shanghai to actively conduct general donations and collect large sums of money in order to expand relief efforts. The original letter and fundraising methods are recorded below.</p>
<p>Original Letter</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, Since the beginning of this summer, the river floods have been severe, and the tragedy is worse than the Yangtze River flood in 1931. Recently, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has risen, and the disaster area has expanded with no end in sight. According to the latest disaster-stricken areas, as many as 140 to 150 counties have been affected, and public and private losses amount to no less than 400 to 500 million yuan. Among them, the disaster situation in Hubei and Shandong is the most severe. The disaster-stricken area in Hubei Province accounts for almost two-thirds of the entire province, western Shandong has already sunk, and southern Shandong is also in extreme danger. Other provinces, such as Hebei, Shaanxi, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangsu, have all been affected by disasters. There are tens of millions of people urgently awaiting relief. As the weather turns cooler in autumn, the need for rescue is even more urgent. Comparing ourselves, who are living in comfort, to them, there is indeed a difference between heaven and hell. How can we bear to sit idly by and watch these tens of millions of suffering compatriots drown, starve, freeze to death, or risk committing crimes and dying? However, the first priority in disaster relief is to be timely. Those compatriots who have been swept away by the surging waves and have nothing to their name are in desperate need of rescue and earnestly await relief, which they cannot endure for even a moment. No matter how difficult it is for us, we must be responsible in every possible way in the absence of any other options. Everyone must do their best, economize on food and clothing, and contribute as much as possible. In addition to the party and government agencies, which have been effectively raising funds by the authorities, all public organizations and industries and businesses in society should mobilize their resources and financial strength, promptly catch up, and donate as much as possible. We have always admired your dedication to public service and your willingness to take on responsibilities. We respectfully hope that you will lead the community, be determined to provide disaster relief, and adopt the attached fundraising methods. On behalf of tens of millions of dying and suffering people, we beseech you with a petition.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Fundraising methods for various public organizations and industries and businesses in the city to raise funds for flood relief: (1) The fundraising for flood relief donations by various public organizations and industries and businesses in the city should be as widespread as possible. All general managers and staff of commercial firms, companies, and factories, faculty, students, and school workers of schools, and all staff of public groups should donate and fulfill their duties. (2) The amount of donation is assumed to be based on the monthly salary or other income per person as a graded standard: those with an income of 400 yuan or more should donate 200 yuan, those with an income of 300 yuan or more should donate 100 yuan, those with an income of 200 yuan or more should donate 50 yuan, those with an income of 100 yuan or more should donate 20 yuan, those with an income of 50 yuan or more should donate 5 yuan, and those with an income of 10 yuan or more should donate 2 jiao. (3) Please send the donations directly to the banks designated by the city for collection, and the association will publish the names in the newspaper the following day. (4) The fundraising period should not be extended and should be completed within two weeks after receiving this letter. (5) This provision does not apply to those public organizations and industries and businesses that have already conducted donations. Please reply immediately and state the life. In light of the urgent work of the Provincial Flood Relief Association, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will do their best to donate and avert this catastrophe.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Association's 300,000 Yuan Loan. The Promissory Note Was Signed Yesterday Afternoon. The Money Has Been Deposited in the Central Bank and Can Be Withdrawn at Any Time.</h3>

The Flood Relief Association has finalized the promissory note and sent it to the Central Bank by Lu Bohong on the 3rd. After the bank gathered the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for a second review on the 4th, it officially invited Lu Bohong, a representative of the Flood Relief Association, to sign it at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon. Each bank will lend 100,000 yuan and will be allocated to the Central Bank that day, which is the representative of the syndicate.

According to Xin Xin News Agency reporters, the loan is for a term of six months, and the interest rate is roughly around four percent. The repayment method is that the flood relief donations collected by each bank will be fully remitted to the Central Bank on a monthly basis. Monthly refunds will be made. As for the remaining 200,000 yuan, 143,000 yuan has been pledged by various banks, and the remaining 57,000 yuan can also be pledged within days.

<h3>Our Newspaper's Flood Relief Donations Received Yesterday Totaled $739.70</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th), this office received donations for flood relief in various provinces, including Mr. Qiu Jia'an, $500; Fu Zhuang, $90; Fu Zhuang's colleagues saving on banquet expenses, $50; Wang Shenyu Hall, $50; Yichang Foreign Firm colleagues, $41.50, including Mr. Fang Guanle, $10; Mr. Liu Meng　, Mr. Li Zhao　, Mr. Liang Pengyun, $5 each; Mr. Ding Youruo　, Mr. Lu Deming, Mr. Liang Zongying, Mr. Zhang Zhongqing, Mr. Zhang Jialong, Mr. Fang Junming, Mr. Cai Yuerong, Mr. Zhuo Wenya, Mr. Zhang Xiangquan, Mr. Guo Peiji, Mr. Zhang Yitang, Mr. Hu Fangzhou, Mr. Chen Qiyi, $1 each; Mr. Xu Zhuoyun, Mr. Cao Zhongyu, Mr. Chen Fangbai, Mr. Gu Gensheng, Mr. Zeng Tiancai, $0.50 each; Mr. Cheng Deyi, $10; Ms. Feng Yuanxin, Mr. Chen Haobin, Mr. Yu Ronglai, Mr. Shao Jigao, $5 each; Mrs. Yu, $4; Mr. Shi Naigong (using $2 borrowed to buy winter clothes for relief, original letter attached below); Mrs. Chen, $2 each; Mr. Xu Jinghuang, $0.10; totaling $739.70. Now, Mr. Shi Naigong's letter is published below. Respectfully, I am over sixty years old and have been poor for generations, still working as a matchmaker. Unfortunately, I lost my younger brother last winter, and this summer, my elder brother and his wife passed away. The funeral expenses have exhausted my resources. Now, due to old age and illness, I wanted to buy cotton clothes to ward off the cold of autumn and winter, and borrowed two dollars from a friend. Suddenly, I remembered this year's flood disaster, which is worse than the one twenty years ago. Without clothes and food, it is unimaginable. I am especially donating the two borrowed dollars for relief. I know that this small amount will be a loss to myself and no help to others. However, Mozi worked tirelessly to benefit the world. How much more so should I donate this small amount of worldly wealth? I humbly hope that the officials, wealthy merchants, and magnates on the coast will think of the suffering and helpless disaster victims and generously donate, and also persuade those who can barely support themselves to donate as I have, then the disaster victims will be very fortunate. (Omitted below). A citizen, Shi Naigong, bows his head.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Representatives and Others Went to Beijing Yesterday to Petition for the Abolition of the Bran Tax in Guangdong. The Petition Analyzes the Advantages and Disadvantages, Listing Five Points. Hankou Manufacturer Representatives Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the oil cake and miscellaneous grain industry opposed the additional bran tax in Guangdong, work and transportation were suspended. Zheng Zenan, Executive Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, together with Gu Xinyi of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Trade Union, manufacturers Chen Ziyao, Cao Xingeng, Jiang Hongbin, and Shanghai-based transportation merchants He Quansheng, Wu Zisheng, etc., took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry. As for the Hankou manufacturer Xie Boqin, he is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The petition is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Petition</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's document to the Central Party Headquarters, the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry states: Regarding the case of the Guangdong Province contracting with merchants to collect additional fees on bran, the association, on August 8th, according to the provisions of Article 62, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, requesting them to stop it, in order to maintain the overall national interest and conform to the tax system. Now, according to a letter from the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association of this city, this bran tax is said to be levied from September 1st. Manufacturers in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wukun, and merchants from various Chaozhou and Shantou gangs have been notified of the urgency and have jointly decided to suspend business and transportation to promote the awareness of the Guangdong tax merchants. Public sentiment is aroused and will not stop until the purpose of abolition is achieved. Our association believes that this matter is closely related to rural areas in various places and cannot bear to sit idly by. After a joint meeting of manufacturers in various places, Gu Xinyi was publicly elected as a representative to request that members of the association be sent to Beijing to petition together with industry representatives. The association believes that if the Guangdong authorities insist on levying this additional bran tax within a limited time, it will inevitably lead to a stalemate. Neither side will see any benefit. It is appropriate to prepare a petition and dispatch Executive Committee Member Zheng Zenan to present it to you together with the industry representative Gu Xinyi. We humbly request that you grant an audience, accept our request, and instruct the Guangdong authorities to abolish the additional bran tax so that the merchants in Jiangsu can escape their predicament and conform to the tax system. This is for the public good. In addition to separate submissions, we respectfully submit this to the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, Standing Committee Members Xu Jilong, Jin Runan, Chen Shuzhen, and Ke Ganchen.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Industry Petition</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Trade Union, etc., petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance, stating: Guangdong Province contracted with merchants to collect additional fees on bran for the construction of Zhongshan University. The production, sales, and transportation parties have repeatedly requested a ban without success, and it has been levied from September 1st, causing merchants and transportation merchants in various places to suspend business and transportation. The matter has been telegraphed to the association and other associations to request that it be forwarded for abolition. However, the previous telegrams did not fully explain the advantages and disadvantages. Since the suspension of business and transportation, public sentiment has been alarmed, heartbroken, and unemployment has suddenly increased. If a rescue is not sought quickly, the consequences will be dire. We dare to venture forward and jointly petition in Beijing. In addition to presenting everything in person, we will further analyze the advantages and disadvantages in detail. We believe that in today's world of fierce economic competition, countries are striving for control to ensure their own survival. China's economic panic is worse than other countries. It is like a leaky boat in the ocean. Even if we work together, it is not enough. How can we each seek our own interests and hasten our own downfall? Now, Guangdong's bran tax is equivalent to giving a death sentence to oil cake factories in various places and giving a major blow to emerging industries, while allowing imported field materials to take the opportunity to invade and seize profits. It can truly be said to be removing one's own defenses and digging one's own grave. This is the first reason why it is unacceptable from the perspective of the national economy. According to Article 62 of the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage, Paragraph 3 prohibits double taxation, Paragraph 5 prohibits unfair taxation on the import of goods from other places for the benefit of one locality, and Paragraph 6 stipulates that transit taxes on local goods should be restricted and exempted by the central government through law to avoid various malpractices. Now, Guangdong's bran tax violates the above provisions and is obviously without merit. This is the second reason why it is unacceptable from the perspective of national law. Furthermore, according to Announcement No. 15 of the Guangdong Finance Commissioner's Office on December 7, 1932, "Domestically produced soybean bran and peanut bran from Guangdong and other provinces are exempt from additional taxes." In May 1934, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee reiterated the order that "only soybean bran from the three northeastern provinces is not required to pay fees." The orders are clear and the established cases are confirmed. Now, suddenly going back on one's word and allowing merchants to contract for it, how can those in power over the people do this? This is the third reason why it is unacceptable from the perspective of official credibility. Moreover, if Guangdong's bran tax has a necessary use, it may be understandable. Now, it is cleverly borrowed in the name of the construction fee for the National Sun Yat-sen University. Not only is the university national, and its expenses should be paid from national taxes, but it is also inappropriate to extract it from bran. National universities are not limited to one, and those established elsewhere have not heard of borrowing additional fees. If Guangdong sets an example, and other provinces follow suit, borrowing and levying fees one after another, how can the people's livelihood bear it? This is the fourth reason why it is unacceptable from the perspective of the use of taxes. Taking a step back, if Guangdong levies additional taxes and the people can still afford it, they may be happy to donate to cultivate talent. However, consider the Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association, etc. In today's telegram to the authorities in Beijing and Guangdong, it says, "In recent years, rural areas have been declining. This summer, floods have spread everywhere. The farmers who cultivate have no way to save themselves. Suddenly, taxes are levied on field materials, all attached to the construction fee of Zhongshan University. Human lives are almost exhausted, let alone talents." It is clear that the pain of Guangdong farmers is evident. Recently, merchants and transportation merchants in various places, worried about the unbearable burden of harsh taxes, have been forced to suspend business and transportation. The suffering is even more evident. The human lives in Wuhu are almost exhausted, let alone talents. Whether the construction fee of Zhongshan University is necessary is still a question, and the people's livelihood is so declining. How can the Guangdong officials bear to do this? This is the fifth reason why it is especially unacceptable from the perspective of the people's lives. In summary, the above five points show that Guangdong's bran tax is absolutely unacceptable. We hereby combine our words to earnestly request that your superiors examine and verify this and promptly telegraph the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Guangdong Finance Department to strictly order the abolition without delay, waiting for orders with utmost urgency. Representatives of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Trade Union, Gu Xinyi, representatives of the above-mentioned merchants, Chen Ziyao, Xin Zhao Geng, representative of Wuxi merchants, Jiang Hongbin, representative of Shanghai-based transportation merchants, He Quansheng, representative of Chaozhou transportation merchants in Shanghai, Wu Zisheng, and also submit a document to the Central Party Headquarters, the Central Political Council, and the Legislative Yuan, stating: In recent years, there are more than 20 emerging oil cake factories in the Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wujin, and Kunshan areas. The soybean cake and peanut cake they produce, that is, the soybean bran and peanut bran that Guangdong Province calls them, are essential for farmers to fertilize the fields. They are transported and sold throughout the country, unhindered, and Guangzhou and Shantou are the main destinations. However, the Guangdong tax merchants, hoping to profit, requested the authorities in the past in 1932 and 1934 to approve the contracting of additional fees on bran for the construction of Zhongshan University. Regardless of where the goods come from, each is levied at 25 cents per unit. Various parties have repeatedly requested a ban without success, and it has been levied from September 1st, causing manufacturers in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wukun, and Guangdong and Shantou transportation merchants to be forced to suspend business and transportation. Public sentiment is alarmed, heartbroken, and unemployment has suddenly increased. If a rescue is not sought quickly, the consequences will be dire. We dare to venture forward and jointly petition in Beijing. In addition to presenting everything in person, we will analyze the advantages and disadvantages in detail. We hope that you will consider them carefully. (The middle part is the same as the previous submission to the Executive Yuan, etc., and is omitted.) In summary, the above five points show that Guangdong's bran tax is absolutely unacceptable. We hereby combine our words to earnestly request that you approve and telegraph the Southwest Political Affairs Committee to strictly order the Guangdong Finance Department to abolish it quickly, in order to maintain the national law and save the people from hardship, waiting for orders with utmost urgency.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Guangdong Provincial Government</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government yesterday, stating: Guangzhou Southwest Political Affairs Committee, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, Guangdong Provincial Government, Greetings. On the 4th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Trade Union, the Guangdong Province is again contracting with merchants to collect additional fees on bran. Merchants and transportation merchants from various places and those in Guangdong Province are concerned about the national system and have repeatedly requested a ban. Your association has telegraphed the authorities in Beijing and Guangdong based on the situation, instructing them to maintain the original plan, but there has been no effect. Now we have definite information that the tax merchants have set September 1st as the date for collection, causing manufacturers in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, and Kunshan, and merchants from various Chaozhou and Shantou gangs, to be forced to jointly decide to suspend business and transportation. How can the public not be alarmed? This move violates the repeated orders that bran from areas other than the three northeastern provinces should not be subject to fees, contradicts the authorities' original intention to protect domestic products over the years, hinders the Guangdong rural areas from falling into a more desperate situation, and destroys the livelihood of manufacturers and transportation merchants in various places. If this reaches the government, where is the national credibility? If it burdens the people's livelihood, how can the people bear it? It is said that Guangdong is working hard to implement a three-year plan and has levied more than 40 kinds of harsh taxes. Now the tax merchants are contracting to collect bran fees, which is even more harmful than harsh taxes. How can the wise authorities allow this to be implemented alone? In addition to jointly telegraphing the authorities in Beijing and Guangdong, requesting them to forward the abolition, we earnestly request that you examine and verify this, extend a helping hand quickly, and strive to achieve the goal of abolition. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully presents this, with the seal attached.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Establish a Large-Scale Banknote Manufacturing Plant in Shanghai with an Authorized Capital of $1.5 Million in National Currency. The Central Trust Bureau is Responsible for Preparatory Matters</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, the Ministry of Finance, in order to recover rights, is currently planning to establish a state-run banknote manufacturing plant (i.e., printing plant). It is understood that this plan will be realized soon. In the past, the banknotes issued by national banks and ordinary commercial banks in China were very large, and their printing and manufacturing were entrusted to foreign banknote companies, especially in the United States. Taking the recent years as an example, the total amount of various banknotes ordered by Chinese banks from foreign countries is about 300 million yuan. As of August of this year, about 160 million yuan has been transported. The printing cost of these banknotes is about 70 cents per note for 5-yuan notes and 20 cents per note for 1-yuan notes. Notes below 1 yuan also cost about 4 cents per sheet for printing. This huge printing cost is a huge loss for China. The financial authorities in China are aware of this and have proposed a plan to establish a banknote manufacturing plant. According to sources, after the plan was designed by personnel designated by the Ministry of Finance, it has gradually become concrete. It is also heard that it has been decided to have an initial capital of about 1.5 million yuan, and has begun to order special equipment for printing banknotes from the United States. It has also been agreed with the U.S. government to hire technicians Mr. Matogus and Mr. Apbaum from the American Banknote Company to come to China to be responsible for technical affairs. It is also learned that the Ministry of Finance has issued an order that the banknote paper should be exclusively sold by the Central Trust Bureau. Therefore, the preparatory and opening matters of the banknote printing plant will also be handed over to the bureau for management after the Central Trust Bureau is formally established. In the future, when the plant is officially opened, all banknote printing matters of Chinese banks will be manufactured by the plant itself.</p>
<h3>Chinese Captains' Association Resolves to Expand Its Organization and Issues a Declaration Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Merchant Marine Captains' Association is a formal group of Chinese sailors, and its committee members are all important figures in the maritime industry. In recent years, the association has regained many lost maritime rights. In order to seek to remove unequal restrictions and promote the development of the shipping industry, the Standing Committee invited all members to a meeting on June 11 of this year to discuss expanding the association's organization. All sailors who have not joined the association should be invited to join, and the scope should be expanded, not limited to graduates of the Wusong Merchant Marine School. Graduates of the Xiamen Jimei School and the Zhejiang Fisheries School who are employed as sailors on Chinese ships are also welcome to join the association. Gathering sailors from various systems on the same front not only increases the strength of the members but is also a fundamental plan to develop maritime affairs and recover maritime rights. The association's declaration is recorded below. Our country has been invaded by the great powers and restricted by unequal treaties, resulting in the decline of the shipping industry, the backwardness of maritime administration, and the loss of maritime rights. It is heartbreaking to talk about it. However, the rise and fall of a country are the responsibility of every citizen. For the development of the shipping industry, the rectification of maritime administration, and the recovery of maritime rights, it is the undeniable responsibility of our Chinese maritime comrades. However, to save effort in doing things, it is impossible to succeed without a whole organization. As the saying goes, "One palm cannot clap, but many hands can lift." Therefore, in 1927, dozens of comrades organized the Chinese Merchant Marine Captains' Association. Since the establishment of the association, all comrades have worked hard to expand, develop, or recover the country's shipping industry and maritime administration, striving to achieve their goals. For example, the re-establishment of merchant marine schools, the establishment of maritime administration bureaus, the employment of Chinese sailors on state-run and private airlines, the inclusion of Chinese people in the Tongsha pilotage, and the Hong Kong government's recognition of Chinese sailors' certificates, etc., the association has been very influential. This is why the association occupies a considerable position in society and is regarded as a powerful organization by the government. However, the progress of association affairs is unlimited, and development has no end. Even if all maritime comrades are on the same line, it is still feared that the strength will not be enough. Moreover, there are still many maritime comrades who have not joined the association. Therefore, the association has resolved to expand its organization and affairs. The committee members have appointed Chen Ganqing, Ji Zinong, Yang Zhixiong, Shen Jiyun, Xu Jijie, and Huang Yajun as committee members. On the one hand, we will strive to improve the association's shortcomings to make it completely sound. On the other hand, we will solicit those maritime comrades who have not joined the association to join, so as to unite and have the same strength as the maritime groups of various countries. This is the wish of the Committee for Expanding the Organization and Affairs of the Association.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Guangdong Bank Has a Surplus After Offsetting Income and Expenses. Colleagues are Willing to Find Ways to Maintain It. There is Much Talk About the Bank's Resumption of Business</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Guangdong Bank was affected by the Hong Kong head office and announced the suspension of business for reorganization the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned from financial circles that although the branch's business situation has not been very profitable in recent years, there is still a surplus after offsetting the total amount of assets and liabilities. The Bankers' Association believes that it has not suffered any losses, so it is determined to try its best to maintain it and will send personnel to investigate all of the bank's assets for preservation in the association in order to liquidate it. It is also learned that there is a strong hope for the bank to resume business, and the Bankers' Association is willing to find ways to maintain it because its past situation was still good. If it is realized, the bank will separate from the head office and operate independently.</p>
<h3>China Overseas Observation Group Renamed Economic Observation Group to the United States. Preparatory Office Officially Established Yesterday. Guo Bingwen is Responsible for the Preparations</h3>
<p>The International Affairs Research Association held its 42nd board meeting at the Bankers' Club on the day before yesterday (the 4th) at noon. Directors such as Liu Zhanen, Guo Bingwen, Dai Zhiqian, Chen Zheqing, Chen Liting, and Li Zhaohuan attended. Chairman Chen Zheqing presided over the meeting, and Secretary Kuang reported that the inaugural issue of the "English China Quarterly," jointly sponsored by the association, the Social Survey Institute, and the Pacific Federation, has been published and distributed to institutions, organizations, schools, and libraries at home and abroad. He also reported on the proposed overseas economic observation group. The various association affairs were then discussed and the following resolutions were made: (1) The scope of the overseas economic observation group is too large and will take too long. It is now renamed the Chinese Economic Observation Group to the United States. Chen Zheqing, Guo Bingwen, and Dai Zhiqian were appointed as preparatory committee members, with Mr. Guo in charge. (2) The Liaison Group will be restored, with Mr. Chen Zheqing as the director. (3) All committees are subordinate to the Liaison Group, and their names should be changed to the Country Section. (4) Jin Guobao, Li Yunliang, and Weng Zilong were approved as members of the association. (5) Mr. Jin Guobao was appointed as the director of the Political and Economic Group, Mr. Guo Bingwen as the chairman of the American Section of the Liaison Group, and Mr. Shen Junyi as the chairman of the German Section of the Liaison Group. A reporter from the Riri News Agency said yesterday that the person in charge of the association said that the overseas economic observation group has been renamed the Chinese Economic Observation Group to the United States, but the organizational methods that have been drafted have not been changed and will still be approved according to the original plan. However, the name is slightly different. The preparatory office of the group was officially established yesterday. It is determined that Director Guo Bingwen will be responsible for the preparations and will soon send circulars to various circles to participate.</p>

Those who have not filled out the application will not be transferred according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>Causes and Prevention of Floods in China - Lecture by Mr. Baker, Advisor to the National Government's Relief Commission</h3>
<p>— Translated and Narrated by Yin Liang</p>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission once compiled statistics on natural disasters in China. In the recent 2,000 years, there have been over 1,800 disasters. The causes of these disasters are floods, droughts, and epidemics. Generally, out of every ten years, nine are affected by disasters, and floods account for eight out of ten of these disasters.</p>
<p>Both floods and droughts are major national problems, but the damage caused by floods is even greater than that caused by droughts. The flood near Tianjin in 1922 caused losses of approximately 300 million yuan. The great Yangtze River flood in 1931 caused losses of 2 billion yuan. Although the losses from this year's flood have not yet been calculated, they are expected to be substantial. We dare say that the losses from just two or three floods would be equivalent to the entire national debt of China.</p>
<p>There are roughly three factors contributing to floods in China:</p>
<p>(1) Weather factors: China's climate is closely related to the winds of the Pacific Ocean. As everyone knows, the Pacific summer monsoon gradually blows from the Pacific Ocean towards northern China. This monsoon brings a lot of moisture. If this moisture slowly descends, then northern China will surely experience "favorable weather, abundant rainfall, and bountiful harvests." However, if this moisture rapidly descends within ten days or two weeks, then this extremely heavy rainfall will inevitably lead to flooding. Conversely, if this monsoon does not arrive, or only blows to a part of the region, the result will certainly be a complete or partial drought. This is the weather factor.</p>
<p>(2) Geographical factors: The capacity of river channels has a significant impact on flooding. The Yangtze River and its tributaries cover approximately two million square kilometers. During the great flood of 1931, the flow rate of the Yangtze River was 850,000 cubic meters per second. However, the capacity of the Yangtze River is only 67,000 cubic meters per second. The water of the Yangtze River cannot immediately flow into the sea, so it inevitably rises. The result of this rise is naturally breaches. Therefore, in 1931, even though the dikes were breached, the water level continued to rise daily. This is the geographical factor.</p>
<p>(3) Soil factors: The upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in China are mostly silt. Silt is easily washed away by water. The water of the Yellow River often contains 40% soil, and approximately 1.25 million tons of soil are discharged into the sea from the Yangtze River every day. This large amount of silt sometimes settles in the middle reaches, which can raise the riverbed and reduce the river channel's capacity. Sometimes, it accumulates in one place, preventing the water from flowing smoothly and leading to flooding. This is the soil factor.</p>
<p>In addition, trees are rarely planted along the banks of China's rivers. As a result, during periods of heavy rainfall, water cannot be stored, and when the water flow is rapid, it cannot be stopped. Therefore, every time there is a flood, it is always impossible to control.</p>
<p>There are many ways to prevent floods. Some people advocate dredging river channels to increase capacity. This is certainly a fundamental solution, but they have not considered the enormity of the project. Some people have estimated that to dredge the Yangtze River from Yichang to the coast by three feet would require 327 of the largest dredgers and cost approximately 300 million yuan. It is naturally impossible to find such a large sum of money at once. Even if we could find a way to raise the funds and start the work, the silt in the upper reaches would still raise the riverbed. Therefore, dredging work can only provide assistance in certain areas. It is impossible to dredge the entire river at present.</p>
<p>Some people advocate dredging lakes to increase water storage capacity. This is also a fundamental solution. The Yangtze River's Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, Taihu Lake, and Weishan Lake are all excellent reservoirs. However, their current capacity is much smaller than it was 2,000 or 500 years ago. There are two reasons for this. First, the sedimentation of silt from floods has raised the lakebed. Second, residents are competing with water for land, which has narrowed the lake surface. Therefore, until a method is found to deal with the silt, dredging lakes is a lot of effort for little gain.</p>
<p>Some people advocate planting trees to stop the water flow. This is naturally also a good method. However, the upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers in China are four to five thousand feet higher than the coast. If trees were planted along the entire length of the rivers, the area planted would be extremely large. The cost of planting the trees would be very high, and the work of maintaining them would be even more difficult. It is naturally impossible to find a way to do this at present. However, planting trees is an excellent method of flood prevention. The Chinese government should gradually proceed within a possible range.</p>
<p>Based on my experience and the results of my inspection of the flood-stricken areas of the rivers, the main method of flood relief in China is still dikes. If it were not for the dikes built in 1932 during this Yangtze River flood, and if it were not for the emergency rescue efforts of the military and civilians, Hankou would certainly not have been spared. Conversely, in the Yellow River area, because no attention was paid to the dikes beforehand, and emergency rescue efforts could not be carried out immediately afterwards, people could only suffer the hardship after the river broke its banks. According to a recent report, the flood in Shandong Province this time has submerged an area of 2,000 square miles, and the total loss is at least over 60 million yuan. If it had been possible to build dikes beforehand and carry out emergency rescue efforts immediately afterwards, the cost would have been only a few hundred thousand yuan. What an uneconomical situation this is!</p>
<p>The dikes that I advocate should fully utilize scientific methods to make them strong and unbreakable. The coastal transportation network, such as telephone and telegraph stations, should be increased as much as possible. In the event of an emergency, all areas can be prevented. I know that two years ago, there were only two inspection reporting stations along the Yellow River. Now there are only nineteen stations. This is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The emergency rescue efforts that I advocate should utilize military methods, with military and civilians cooperating. Emergency rescue is a difficult task. People doing emergency rescue work should have a fixed period. After this period, they should be allowed to rest, and others should be sent to replace them. The food and drink during working hours should be plentiful. Local officials should lead by example, like the emergency rescue work in Hankou this time, which is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>I hope that the Chinese government and people will make every effort to build and protect dikes in the future. When a danger occurs, they should use all their strength to carry out emergency rescue efforts. At the same time, experts should design plans for dredging river channels, dredging lakes, and planting trees, and gradually raise funds to carry out these three tasks in a step-by-step manner. China's floods can certainly be avoided.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association - Outline of Work for the Current Year - Has Been Formulated by the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The outline of work for the current year of the Chinese Aviation Association has been formulated by the Board of Directors: (1) Establishing branch associations in various locations; (2) Continuing to recruit new members in Shanghai and urging existing members to pay their annual membership fees; (3) Establishing a Flying Club; (4) Laying the foundation of the Association; (5) Organizing an aircraft model exhibition, etc. These five items are currently being actively implemented. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the current status of the Association's affairs, made a special visit to Mr. Yao Xijiu, Secretary-General of the Association, who provided a detailed account of the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Establishing Branch Associations</p>
<p>Drafting Organizational Charters</p>
<p>After the headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association was established in Shanghai some time ago, thanks to the efforts of various parties to promote it, the call for saving the country through aviation permeated the city, and public sentiment was extremely enthusiastic. At that time, there was a plan to establish branch and sub-branch associations in various provinces, cities, and important towns. After drafting organizational charters, they were submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions to the provincial and municipal governments, and the Association sent letters urging local chambers of commerce to invite local groups to initiate organizations in various locations. Upon receiving the letters, they proceeded one after another.</p>
<p>Branch Associations Established in Four Provinces</p>
<p>Currently, branch associations have been established in the four provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan. When the branch associations were established, the headquarters sent personnel to participate and provide guidance. The responsible personnel of the branch associations have been appointed. (1) The Zhejiang Provincial Branch Association has 15 directors, including standing directors Huang Shaoxiong, Huang Huabiao, Zhou Zhirou, Zhou Xiangxian, and Jin Runquan, and Secretary Tu Guangjun. (2) The Fujian Provincial Branch Association has 15 directors, including standing directors Sa Zhenbing, Chen Ticheng, and Zhan Diao, Luo Mianhou, and Chen Hong, Honorary Chairman Chen Yi, Secretary Chen Hong, and has appointed Sa as the fundraising team leader, with a target of recruiting 50,000 members and raising 500,000 yuan in funds. (3) The Jiangxi Provincial Branch Association has 15 directors, including standing directors Wang Ge, Xu Duanfu, Jin Huaiqing, Lei Ze, and Wan Zhucun, Honorary Chairman Xiong Shihui, Gu Zhutong, and has appointed Gong Xuesui as the fundraising team leader, with a target of recruiting 100,000 members and raising 1 million yuan in funds. (4) The Hunan Provincial Branch Association has 11 directors, including standing directors He Jian, Deng Weichuan, and Huang Peishi.</p>
<p>Second Fundraising in Shanghai</p>
<p>The headquarters held its first fundraising campaign in Shanghai, with excellent results. It purchased 18 fighter planes and presented them to the government. The participants were extremely enthusiastic each time a naming and donation ceremony was held, as the aviation industry had aroused the interest of the Chinese people. This spring, the Association held its second fundraising campaign, continuing to recruit new members and urging existing members to pay their annual membership fees. The Association hired Mayor Wu to continue serving as the team leader and planned to organize 439 fundraising teams, sending letters to leaders from all walks of life in the city to serve as team leaders and conduct fundraising in groups. The Association also sent staff members such as Zhang Yuliang to negotiate with various industry groups for industry donations. Currently, negotiations have been completed and are being implemented in stages, including 20,000 yuan from the brick and tile industry and the brick and tile transportation industry, and 100,000 yuan each from the transportation automobile industry, the sand and stone industry, and the dance hall industry, etc. Those still under negotiation include the chicken and duck industry, the film industry, and the brothel industry, etc. Negotiations are also underway for various recreational activities, such as the St. Elena tea dance, the concert of the National Conservatory of Music, and the swimming competition of the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College, which have been held one after another with good results. Furthermore, the large-scale aviation carnival prepared by team leader Lu Shoulian will be held in mid-October at the Paramount Ballroom. It is reported that this fundraising campaign has received support from all parties, so the results have been very good. As of now, more than 100,000 yuan in donations have been received.</p>
<p>Establishing a Flying Club</p>
<p>Training Aviation Talents</p>
<p>Training aviation talents is one of the Association's important tasks. The Board of Directors previously passed a proposal to establish a Flying Club, which was submitted to the Central Government for instructions. The Military Affairs Commission then issued instructions to carefully raise funds, determine the budget, and draft training methods and regulations to be sent to the Association for review. The Association followed the instructions and carefully drafted the methods and regulations, etc., which have now been approved. A letter has also been sent to the municipal government to designate a site at the Longhua Airfield for the construction of hangars, which has also been approved. Construction will begin immediately. In addition to the Association's existing two training aircraft, the "Save the Nation" and the "Tianchu Vice," it plans to purchase two more. The government has also agreed to allocate one or two aircraft. Therefore, all matters have been prepared, and enrollment will begin soon, and training will commence.</p>

<h3>Jardine Matheson's New Desheng Ship - Open for Visits Today - There are Four Similar Ships in Total</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson's newly built Desheng ship has arrived in Shanghai for the first time. Because the ship was in a hurry to go to Qingdao, the company did not have time to invite people from all walks of life to visit the ship. The ship has now returned to Shanghai from Qingdao and is docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. The company will officially invite people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit the ship from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM today, and tea and snacks will be provided. It is reported that the company has built a total of four ships of the same type as the new Desheng, all of which will run on the Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong route. In addition to Desheng, the remaining ship names are New Yisheng, New Taisheng, and New Hesheng, all of which can be completed and arrive in Shanghai for operation this year.</p>
<h3>The 14th Aviation Ticket Drawing Will be Held Today - Broadcasting Report - Welcome to Visit</h3>
<p>The 10th Aviation Highway Construction Lottery will still be drawn in public at 2:00 PM today (the 6th) at Yiyuan, Albert Road, French Concession, Shanghai. All winning tickets will be paid out by the Central, China, and Communications Banks in various locations starting on the 14th of this month. It was recently learned from the person in charge of the lottery office that since the 13th lottery, which was changed to a monthly drawing, the number of lottery tickets issued per lottery has decreased by two-fifths compared to before, while the proportion of winning tickets has increased by more than 630 tickets compared to before. The chances of winning have increased compared to before, so the purchase of tickets is very enthusiastic. It was also said that the organizers would be delighted if people from all walks of life would come to visit the drawing, and that they have agreed with various radio stations to broadcast the drawing in Chinese, English, Russian, and French as it takes place. Anyone in this city or other cities with a radio receiver can listen to the numbers at any time. The broadcasting frequencies of the radio stations are listed below: Overseas Chinese XMHC (700 kHz), Buddhist Voice XMHB (980 kHz), China-America XMHA (600 kHz), Curious News XQHB (820 kHz), Jianhua XHHB (740 kHz).</p>
<h3>Five Japanese Arrested in Hangzhou for Eating and Lodging for Free - Now Extradited to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese Daily News reported that there were five Japanese, one of whom was Nishikawa Jinichi from Hyogo Prefecture, who managed a hair salon; the second was Hiroki Hosuke from Kobe; the third was Yoshiji Niwa from Hyogo Prefecture; the fourth was Kazuo Yanase from Mie Prefecture; and the fifth was Sanshu Araki from Nagasaki Prefecture. All five of them came to China with the desire to make a fortune quickly, but unexpectedly, their business ventures all failed. So they went to Hangzhou together and stayed in Chinese hotels, spending money lavishly until they had nothing left. They had no choice but to try to eat and live for free, so they were arrested by the Hangzhou police and extradited to the Shanghai Consulate General. After a severe reprimand, they were escorted back to their country on the Nagasaki Maru.</p>
<h3>Repairing Water Pipes - Falling into a Boiling Water Cauldron - Feng Mengfu Dies from Scalding</h3>
<p>The Ward Road Prison is equipped with several large cauldrons with water faucets for convenient water collection. Each cauldron has a water faucet near the wall. On the 22nd of last month, one of the faucets suddenly broke and could not be used to collect water. Therefore, the prison supervisor ordered Feng Mengfu (Guangdong native, 29 years old, currently residing at No. 774, Chengzhi Lane, Huichang Road), a plumber from the Shanghai Municipal Council Works Department, to come and repair it. During the work, Feng could only stand on the cauldron lid. Unexpectedly, at that moment, there was boiling water in the cauldron. Feng was careless for a moment and stepped on the side of the lid, which suddenly overturned, causing Feng to fall into the cauldron as well. He was severely scalded. Upon seeing this, prison guard No. 13 hurriedly tried to rescue him and sent him to the police hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, Inspector Zhao Yongqing from the Huishan Police Station under the jurisdiction was dispatched to investigate and found the facts to be true. Unfortunately, Feng eventually died of his injuries at around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. The body was taken to the autopsy station on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, and forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others came to the station to examine the body. According to West Patrol Head Li Pu's report of the previous situation, Judge Guo then announced that the deceased Feng Mengfu was male and had died from scalding by boiling water during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his aunt Feng Huangshi, who signed a bond to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3>Fingerprints Used to Identify a Thief - Jin Biren Sentenced to Two Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Jin Biren, a native of Suzhou, 25 years old, had received a considerable education and had served as a teacher in a certain elementary school. He lived at No. 19 Wenmiao Road. Recently, after losing his job, he had difficulty making a living and had no choice but to take risks. He had successively stolen typewriters, fountain pens, dictionaries, and other items from the China-America Petroleum Company, the Standard Oil Company, the Mackie &amp; Company, and the Lipton Company, and pawned them for cash. At around 5:00 PM on December 10 of last year, Jin went to Room 30, 1st Floor, No. 51 Guangdong Road, intending to repeat his old tricks. Unexpectedly, he was discovered, so he fled without success, but had left a fingerprint. The police officers took a photo of the fingerprint and notified all police stations to investigate. On the 27th of last month, at 9:00 PM, Jin was arrested by Chinese Detective Pang Ruiqing from the Zhabei Police Station for consuming red pills at No. 28, Lane 414, No. 400 Guangdong Road. He was sentenced to a fine of 15 yuan by the First Special District Court. Then, based on the fingerprints, Jin's previous crimes were discovered, and the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu filed a complaint accusing him of habitual theft. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce questioned him in the Second Criminal Court. Jin confessed without denying anything. Judge Zhan then announced the verdict, sentencing Jin Biren to two years in prison for habitual theft, and ordering the stolen goods to be returned to the original owners.</p>
<h3>Cloth Shop Scammed and Bankrupted, Scoundrels Take the Opportunity to Defraud, Old Woman Chen Li Suffers Significant Losses</h3>
<p>An old woman from Ningbo named Chen Li, nearly fifty years old, operated the Yingfeng Weaving Factory at No. 2, Chunyu Lane, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. It was a small-capital business engaged in mechanized weaving. On the 24th of last month, a Mr. Gu, a salesman from the Sanhecheng Foreign Goods Store on Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, came to Chen Li's Yingfeng Factory to purchase thirty bolts of cloth produced by the factory. He stated that the price of the goods was 274 yuan and instructed that the goods be delivered to the Sanhecheng Store and payment would be made there. Chen Li immediately sent a worker to deliver the cloth to the Sanhecheng Store as instructed, and he received a check from the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank dated August 27th for 274 yuan. He was told to go to the bank to collect the payment. After receiving the check, Chen Li rushed to the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road to collect the money, but found that the bank was already closed. She returned to the Sanhecheng Store to reason with them, but unexpectedly, the Sanhecheng Store had closed down within a few hours. The people and assets had all been moved away. Mrs. Li cried out in despair and returned to her factory feeling deeply aggrieved. She entrusted a friend named Wu Shaokui to find the owner, staff, and Mr. Gu of the Sanhecheng Store. On the first of this month, Wang and his friend Monk Ma encountered Bi Hao'an, a salesman from the Sanhecheng Store (36 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 34, Baolong Lane, Wengjia Lane, Ximen), in the Laoximen area. They immediately took Bi to Room 13 of the Oriental Apartment at No. 415, Beile Road, in the French Concession. They then invited Du Keming, Dai Zifang, Li Yongchang, and Lu Siwei to the Oriental Apartment. Du, pretending to be a detective from the French Concession Police, interrogated Bi aggressively. Bi finally revealed that the thirty bolts of cloth from Chen Li were pawned at Wu Jikun's Dahua Xiang Foreign Goods Store at No. 300, Tangshan Road, for 90 yuan. This was because they had first obtained fifty printed bedsheets from Wu, valued at 67 yuan, for sale on credit. They had not paid for the goods, so they pawned the cloth to Wu, and so on. After hearing this, Wang, Du, and others hired a Xiang Sheng taxi and rushed to the Dahua Xiang Foreign Goods Store. After obtaining ten bolts of the original cloth from Wu Jikun, Wang and the others did not inform the victim Chen Li. Instead, they pawned five bolts of cloth at the Jifeng Pawnshop at No. 294, Beile Road, for 16 yuan, and two bolts at the Yuan Sheng Pawnshop at No. 337, Pingji Li Road, for 6 yuan. They then divided the money among themselves. After releasing Bi, Bi felt aggrieved and reported the matter to the French Concession Police for investigation. The detectives Zhang Ziying, Jin Bing, and Ma Yizhi arrested Du Keming, Dai Zifang, Wang Shaokui, and Monk Ma. They also retrieved seven bolts of the original factory's cloth from the Jifeng and Yuan Sheng Pawnshops. Three bolts were still missing and could not be recovered. Accomplices Li Yongchang and Lu Siwei fled upon hearing the news and could not be apprehended. Yesterday morning, the police, along with Chen Li and Bi Hao'an, sent the four defendants, including Du, to Criminal Court 1 of the Special Court 2. Judge Zhang Chaozuo interrogated them. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Department, explained the case and requested a postponement pending further investigation. The investigating detective then reported the details of the arrest of the defendants and the recovery of the stolen goods. After questioning the plaintiff Bi Hao'an, Chen Li, and the defendants, the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and granted a postponement for further questioning.</p>

<h3>More Than 30 Trade Associations Jointly Send a Letter to Telephone Experts, Offering Three Points of Advice and Requesting Full Consideration</h3>
<p>More than 30 groups, including the Construction Plant Industry Association, jointly sent a letter yesterday to the Telephone Expert Committee of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, stating that the Shanghai Telephone Company previously wanted to achieve its goal of a 1% annual interest rate. To change to pay-per-call billing, in addition to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau having already approved its additional 11% from April 1935, it also hired telephone experts to study billing methods in order to obtain a reasonable solution. Now, the experts have traveled across the ocean and come to Shanghai to start research. The associations, having experienced this firsthand, dare to express their opinions and hope for your consideration. (1) Pay-per-call billing should not be adopted. The Shanghai Telephone Company's change to pay-per-call billing completely increases proportionally and cannot fill its insatiable desires. It uses the beautiful name of leveling to suddenly increase the burden on users several times. Its motives are already questionable, and after pay-per-call billing, how will the calculation method be accurate? As evidenced by the past, the arbitrary filling of communication fees in the Chinese concession will inevitably lead to endless disputes in the future, so pay-per-call billing should not be adopted to eliminate its drawbacks. (2) A 1% annual interest rate should not be taken into account. The 1% annual interest rate was stipulated in the contract signed between the Engineering Bureau and the company in 1930. However, at that time, the Shanghai market was extremely prosperous. Recently, factory and store closures have been frequently heard, and the commercial decline has reached its peak. Even the existing survivors are all outwardly strong but inwardly weak and difficult to maintain. If forced to increase, they will inevitably be dismantled one after another, which will narrow the scope of telephone use day by day. For the company's future, it is also unwise. It should first save on expenses and try to maintain the status quo, and then seek progress when the market turns around in the future. In this irresistible trend of economic downturn, a mere contract cannot be effective, so the stipulated 1% interest should no longer be taken into account. (3) The Chinese concession communication fee should be abolished. Telephone is one of the public utilities, and the first priority is to facilitate users. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau charge 5 cents per call within the same area, which is unprecedented in the world. After several appeals and negotiations, there were no results. This kind of unreasonable burden violates the original purpose of public utilities and hinders commercial development. It should be abolished immediately to facilitate users. The above three points are related to our vital interests. We hereby request your committee to adopt them as much as possible. We sincerely hope so. To the Telephone Expert Committee of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau.</p>

<h3>Pinzhen Seeks Bail for Detained Jewelry</h3>
<p>Pinzhen Jewelry Store was selling goods at low prices. Based on reports from informants, the Customs suspected tax evasion and filed a lawsuit with the Legal Department of the Public Concession. The Special District Court No. 1 repeatedly summoned and interrogated them, and the diamond jewelry, valued at approximately 75,000 yuan, was temporarily detained. Subsequently, due to the issue of jurisdiction in the case, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Justice of the Special Court to forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Finance for interpretation. Before receiving a reply, it could only be postponed temporarily. The lawyer representing Pinzhen Jewelry Store requested that the court consider the difficulties of the business and return the goods first to maintain Pinzhen's business. The court approved it, and last Thursday it ordered the goods to be returned on bail. Yesterday morning, Pinzhen invited the guarantor to the court to inquire and sign the guarantee, and immediately ordered the police to return the detained goods so that Pinzhen Jewelry Store could resume business as usual.</p>

<p>The Fada Road Baocheng Silver Shop, founded by Shanghai merchants Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, etc., has been open for half a year since its opening in March this year. The business is developed and its reputation is outstanding, and the goods are novel and eye-catching, which can attract the joy of all sectors.

<p>At about 2:30 AM yesterday morning, a cargo truck, with the municipal government number 13285 and the concession number 16644, loaded with various vegetables, was driving from Beixinjing to the Fuzhou Road vegetable market in the concession. The truck was also carrying more than 20 vendors. When the driver turned the car north at the Dongxin Bridge on Edward Road and Zhejiang Road, it had just stopped raining slightly, and the ground was abnormally muddy and slippery. The center of gravity of the car was completely on top, causing it to overturn immediately. The vegetables and vendors were completely thrown to the ground.

<h3>Traveler at Dafang Hotel Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>At 9:30 PM on the 3rd, a guest wearing a striped Shengfang short shirt and trousers arrived at the Dafang Hotel at No. 20, Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen North, French Concession. He registered the name Wei Lin, 25 years old, from Ningbo, doing metal business in the registration book. The receptionist led him to room No. 13 and paid the room fee. Wei chatted and laughed as usual and did not show any abnormalities. Soon after, he closed the door and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, Wei did not know what stimulation he had and secretly swallowed lysol and sleeping pills in the room to commit suicide. At 7:00 AM the next morning, the tea waiter Weng Ziwei (35 years old), from Ningbo, discovered that Wei's face was pale and he was about to die. He immediately informed the accounting room and prepared a car to send Wei to the Shanghai Hospital at the Santai Wharf in Nanshi for treatment. He also reported to the Xiaodongmen French Concession Police, who sent detectives to investigate the Dafang Hotel. They found an empty lysol bottle and a sleeping pill paper box, but nothing else. The detective took the medicine bottle to the police station. Wei's poisoning was so deep that the treatment was ineffective. He died in the hospital an hour after being admitted. The hospital notified the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch morgue. There was no way to find the family. Yesterday morning, the Special Court No. 2 was reported to and appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic clerk to come to the morgue to verify that the deceased had indeed died from taking poison before his death. The official questioned Weng Ziwei, the tea waiter of the Dafang Hotel, and then ordered the body to be handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing and burial, pending family identification. The medicine bottle and medicine box were taken to the hospital for storage.</p>
<h3>Daxin Silk and Satin Store's Relocation Sale is Approaching, Repeatedly Reducing Prices and Sacrificing Profits, All Goods Added at the Same Time</h3>
<p>Since Daxin Silk and Satin Store at the intersection of Third Road and Shilu and its affiliate Huahua Silk and Satin Company held a joint relocation sale in preparation for moving to the new site at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, its sufficient inventory, all kinds of goods, and high quality have made it a crowded place for customers all day long, and it is universally recognized as the only store with honest and meager profits. At the time when the autumn wind is refreshing, women from all walks of life are just adding new clothes. The store is re-reducing prices and sacrificing profits for various inventories. All kinds of brand-new patterned silks and satins are also included in the sale. According to customers who went to the store to trade, the purchase price of silk and satin is only the price of cloth, which shows the low price of the store. The new site of the store is about to be completed and will need to be moved soon. The sale period is short, and I hope that you will not miss this rare opportunity.</p>
<h3>Two Right Feet Found at the Entrance of Ciyunfang, Wangzhi Road, and a Piece of Baby's Excised Anus Flesh, Shocking Pedestrians and Spectators in Nearby Residences</h3>

<h3>In the Case of the Old Monk of Putuoshan Being Defrauded: The Female Lead is Accused by Her Husband. Shao Ruikang Sues His Wife for Repeatedly Eloping; Qiu Zhongyuan and His Mother-in-Law Are Also Accused of Offenses Against Morality</h3>
<p>The abbot of Faru Temple on Putuoshan, Monk Youming, came to Shanghai to solicit donations. Zhang Ayuan, the maternal uncle of Ye Ruilin, a former tea server from Ningbo, colluded with Qiu Zhongyuan to use a "honey trap." They lured Wang A'mei, a woman from Ningbo, to enter the monk's room on the evening of March 4th of this year. Afterwards, Zhang and others entered, falsely accusing them of adultery, forcibly stripping them of their clothes, taking photographs, and then holding them at the Oriental Hotel, forcing him to sign a promissory note to extort money. After Youming returned to the mountain, he reported to the Buddhist Association, which was then reported to the Shanghai French Concession Police Station by a standing committee member on behalf of the abbot. Detectives were dispatched to arrest Qiu, Wang Zhangshi (Wang A'mei's mother), and Wang A'mei, and they were sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution and trial.</p>
<p>As a result, Qiu Zhongyuan was sentenced to six months of imprisonment and a fine of four hundred yuan. Wang Zhangshi and Wang A'mei were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, Shao Ruigeng (an employee at the Laotiancheng Herbal Medicine Store at 56 Zhonghua Road), Wang A'mei's husband, has filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Qiu Zhongyuan, Wang A'mei, Wang Zhangshi, etc., of offenses against morality and family, and requesting a legal trial. Yesterday, based on the lawsuit, Judge Xiong Huihua, accompanied by clerk Tao Zongkan, specially opened the Second Criminal Court for trial. The plaintiff, Shao Ruigeng, arrived on time. The defendant, Qiu Zhongyuan, arrived with his defense lawyer, Ge Zitan. Wang A'mei and Wang Zhangshi were brought from the detention center. After the judge took his seat, he called the parties to the case and questioned them about their names and ages.</p>
<p>Shao Ruikang testified that he was 26 years old, from Ningbo, and engaged in the herbal medicine business, residing at 56 Zhonghua Road. Qiu Zhongyuan testified that he was 43 years old, from Fenghua, residing at 98 Wangzhi Road, operating the Songmao Coal Store, and that the lawsuit involving the monk was a miscarriage of justice and he intended to appeal. Wang A'mei testified that she was 18 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 10 Caishi Road. Wang Zhangshi testified that she was 40 years old, working as a nanny, residing at 10 Caishi Road. Mother and daughter both stated that the lawsuit involving the monk was unjust. The court then ordered the plaintiff to state the purpose of his lawsuit. According to Shao, Wang A'mei's real name was Dai Awei, and she was 19 years old this year. His mother-in-law, Wang Zhangshi, was actually Dai Zhangshi, and she was 41 years old this year. They changed their names and falsely reported their ages. He was accusing the defendants of</p>
<p>offenses against morality and family. His mother-in-law had tricked his wife away and there had been a previous case about it. After he formally married Dai Awei in his hometown on January 13, 1932, not long after, his mother-in-law, Dai Zhangshi, came to his house and took his daughter to live at her house. The following year, on June 25, she brought her to Shanghai and stayed at 185 Guangxi Road for ten days and then left. When he found out, he sent someone to escort her back to Ningbo. In July, his mother-in-law did not send his daughter back, telling him that she would not be responsible after handing her over to him. In July of last year, his mother-in-law suddenly came to reprimand him for not supporting his wife and wanted to take her back to Ningbo. After an argument, both parties went to the Public Security Bureau for mediation. On October 21,</p>
<p>his wife suddenly ran away. He reported it to the Public Security Bureau, who arrested her and sent her to the local court, which dismissed the case. After being released, she did not return to his place. In April of this year, his mother-in-law came to inform him that she had found his wife and wanted him to pay 140 yuan to take her back. He refused to pay. Under duress, he went to the Public Security Bureau and was sent to the local court, which ruled that it was a civil dispute and instructed him to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division. Later, they requested mediation from the local court, ordering him to take his wife back. After receiving the mediation record, he went to his mother-in-law's residence at 18 Tongkang Lane, No. 18, but she only said that his wife was working as a helper. The second time he went, he still couldn't see her. Then, Qiu Zhongyuan came to his store,</p>
<p>Qiu dressed in Western clothes and sitting in a chartered car, exuding an air of generosity. He told him that his mother-in-law was working as a helper at his house and had told him bad things about him, persuading him to pay to take his wife back. He still refused to pay. Qiu volunteered to pay for him first, and he would repay him later. He still refused. Qiu also said that he was friends with the manager of the Fuchang Ginseng Company on Xiangua Street and was going to Fuchang today on business, so he came to see him to persuade him. He did not agree. After Qiu left, he inquired with the manager of Fuchang, who said that he did not know Qiu Zhongyuan. After that, he could not find Qiu and his mother-in-law's address, so he could not file a lawsuit and had to put it aside for the time being. Until this time, when they were reported in the newspaper about the monk's affair, Wang A'mei, Dai Awei, and his name were mentioned. After seeing it, he rushed to the court to see Wang A'mei before the court session.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was his wife, and Wang Zhangshi was indeed his mother-in-law. They colluded to do this unlawful and shameless thing, so he filed a lawsuit. The judge asked him which articles of the criminal law he was citing in his lawsuit. He replied that he was accusing Qiu of offenses against morality under Article 231 of the Criminal Law, and Wang A'mei and Wang Lushi of offenses under Article 243 of the Criminal Law. The judge told Shao that, according to the law, he could not sue his wife, Wang A'mei, himself and should report it to the police. Shao acknowledged the instruction. He also claimed that Monk Youming was having an affair with his wife and requested that Youming be arrested and brought to justice. The judge said that he had to submit a written statement and could not just say it verbally. The judge asked Wang A'mei, "Are you Dai Awei, and is Shao Ruikang your husband?" The woman replied yes. The judge asked Wang Zhangshi, who also admitted that it was true, Shao</p>
<p>was her son-in-law. At this point, the judge ordered Qiu and Wang A'mei to leave. He questioned Wang Zhangshi, who testified that Shao had beaten her daughter and she had found her and asked Shao to come and take her back. He didn't come for more than ten days, so she filed a lawsuit in court. She did not know about her daughter's recent affair with the monk. Her daughter was currently living with the monk and had been for three months. She received one hundred yuan, which was given to her by Zhang Ayuan. She did not know that Qiu Zhongyuan and Wang A'mei were having an affair with the monk. It was voluntary. Because she had no food or clothing, Zhang Ayuan gave her one hundred yuan, which she used to pay off debts. Qiu Zhongyuan testified that he did not know them. In August of last year, the monk called him to go to the Oriental Hotel to act as a middleman. He had Qiu Baoyuan draw up a promissory note for the monk but did not know that person. The judge asked him what he was counter-suing Shao Ruikang for. Qiu replied that he had been unjustly sued,</p>
<p>his reputation had been damaged, and he (referring to Shao) was still coming to sue him. Therefore, he filed a counterclaim, demanding that he compensate him five hundred yuan. He (referring to Shao) was instigated by the monk to sue him, which Chen Hongxun had told him. He requested that Chen be summoned to testify. The judge then questioned Shao Ruikang about the counterclaim. Shao replied that he saw the newspaper on August 11 and came to the court to see them on the 19th, after which he filed the lawsuit. There was no such thing as the monk telling him to sue. He did not know Chen Hongxun. Qiu Zhongyuan came to his store, and his colleague, surnamed Ge, and others witnessed it and could be summoned, etc. At this point, the judge instructed that the case required investigating the case files from the previous case and summoning additional witnesses and adjourned it to be retried later. The defendant, Qiu Zhongyuan, was released on bail, the same bail as before. Wang A'mei and Wang Zhangshi were remanded in custody. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Supplement to the Shenbao Yearbook Published</h3>
<p>In this day and age, whether engaged in politics, scholarship, industry, commerce, or serving society, it is necessary to understand the current situation. However, the current situation changes and evolves, differing from month to month and year to year. The publication of the China Yearbook is often heard of, but unfortunately, the yearbooks compiled by various political or business institutions often limit the materials collected to the scope of their own businesses and are not sufficient for universal application by all sectors. The Shenbao Yearbook, compiled and printed by the Shenbao Publishing House, covers materials from all parties, presenting the latest real-world situation and its evolution in its entirety to the Chinese people in more than 20 categories. The book has been published three times. Not only is the content broad, but the records and statistics on various important issues are also complete. It also takes great pains to collect the latest surveys and make careful selections each year. Over the years, it has received materials from central and local administrative agencies, and academic institutions such as the institutes of the Academia Sinica, the Geological Survey, the Institute of Chinese Statistics and Economics, and the Zhejiang Library have also been happy to cooperate. Furthermore, many well-known domestic experts participate in the drafting and consultation of the content. Therefore, although it is a general yearbook, it has the value of academic research. It is sufficient to serve as a consultant for various fields, and it is also indispensable for teachers and staff of large, medium, and small schools and students above the secondary level who are concerned about current affairs. It is known that the 1935 Shenbao Yearbook was divided into a main edition and a supplementary edition due to publishing procedures. The main edition has already been published, and the supplementary edition has also been printed recently and is sent with the main edition at no extra charge. The special price for the entire book is now on sale until the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>The City Party Headquarters Instructs the City Chamber of Commerce That If Businesses Do Not Comply with the Association's Regulations, the Members' Congress Should Decide on Measures Based on the Facts and Submit Them to the Local Senior Party Headquarters for Approval Before Handling</h3>
<p>According to Guomin She, the City Party Headquarters previously received a reply from the City Chamber of Commerce regarding how to handle companies and shops that have not joined the industry association and do not comply with the industry association's proposals. It was submitted to the Central Government for interpretation. It is now heard that the department has received a reply from the Central Public Movement Guidance Committee. In addition to notifying the City Social Bureau to check, the department also instructed the City Chamber of Commerce of this city to inform the industry associations of all industries, the original order is as follows: "For informing affairs, the Central Executive Committee's Public Movement Guidance Committee's official letter No. 1082 opened as follows: 'The Guihui's Executive Character No. 4787 official letter opened, asking how to handle all companies and shops that have not joined the industry association if they do not comply with the resolutions of the industry association. After investigating and reviewing the facts, it was found that if businesses that have not joined the industry association do not comply with the resolutions of the industry association, the members' congress should decide on measures based on the severity of the facts and circumstances and submit them to the local senior party headquarters for approval before handling them. This is hereby replied by the corresponding letter for reference.'" According to this, it was found that this case was previously forwarded by the association's reply, so it has been forwarded in a letter. In addition to the Social Bureau's verification, the matter is hereby ordered to be informed to the association and to be informed to the industry associations of all industries under its jurisdiction for the matter. This order,</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Approved the Swapping of Old Stamp Tax Stamps in the City. As Soon as the Provincial Name is Overprinted, the Stamps Can Be Issued to the Provincial Bureau for Distribution</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received six articles from the Ministry of Finance on the method of exchanging old stamp tax stamps. Although it was stated that new stamps would be exchanged from July onwards, it was still necessary to collect the old stamps, count them, seal them after counting, and submit them to the bureau to exchange them for new stamps. Only after the new stamps were received could they be distributed to each household. There were many twists and turns in between. The association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on July 10th to ask whether the method of exchanging old stamps could first be used to deliver the new stamps that should be exchanged in Shanghai to the Provincial Bureau, where they would be carried to the association together with the counting committee to pay the stamps as they were counted and exchanged as they were paid, which would be more convenient. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating that the new stamps would be issued to the Provincial Bureau for distribution as soon as the provincial name was overprinted and that the stamps would be issued to shops for use by the association. The approval is recorded below: The telegram of July 27 has been received. The provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of the method of exchanging old stamp tax stamps refer to the new stamps that should be exchanged each month, which should be issued by the Ministry to the Provincial Bureau for exchange by the Chamber of Commerce. The old stamps that should be recovered each month should be submitted by the Chamber of Commerce to the Provincial Bureau for verification and cancellation by the Ministry. Although the article does not mention the exchange and distribution by the Chamber of Commerce, Article 5 stipulates that the number of stamps to be exchanged each month by each shop should be distributed by the Chamber of Commerce of each province and city according to the amount of stamps in storage, etc. It is clear that the new stamps exchanged each month should be distributed to the shops by the Chamber of Commerce. As for the exchange of old stamps for new stamps, if they need to be paid in two months or more according to the standard after collecting, counting, and sealing, they should be exchanged once a month, not at any time. The old stamps approved for exchange in Shanghai total more than 22,000 yuan. The ministry has approved that 8,000 yuan should be exchanged in July and August respectively, and more than 6,000 yuan should be exchanged in September. As soon as the provincial name is overprinted on the stamps to be exchanged in July and August, they can be issued to the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, and 16,000 yuan of old stamps should be recovered and cancelled. Please note this approval.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the editor: Our member, Yin Dianyuan, had 53 pieces of Shenghua soil-fired goods that complied with tax regulations illegally seized by the Shanghai Inspection Office on August 3 on the grounds that they were for making wine. Our association has already telegraphed the government and the court in winter to urgently stop this. Now, reading your newspaper's "Notice to Wine Merchants from the Shanghai Inspection Office," it says that our association representative Feng Zijing notified the Liangshao Association of various matters, which is "purely fabricated rumors to confuse the public." We are extremely surprised. Our association's goods of Yin Dianyuan were illegally seized by the Inspection Office and have not been released, which has aroused the public anger of all wine merchants, who have unanimously and voluntarily suspended business. For the sake of business conditions, our association specially notified the Shanghai representative Feng Zijing, which is a fact. Therefore, we specially write to your newspaper for verification in order to clarify the facts. Please take note, Mr. Chief Editor of Shen Bao. Ji Guobiao, Chairman of the Taixing Wine Industry Association, September 5th.</p>

<h3>Yousheng Travel Group Sports Department - Disaster Relief Fundraising Sports Meet Postponed - Held from the 9th to the 12th</h3>

<h3>The Youth Cycling Touring Group Will Tour Songjiang This Sunday; Kunshan Trip a Complete Success</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Cycling Touring Group, recently organized, completed a trip to Kunshan last week. At 6:30 AM one morning, twenty-seven participants gathered in front of the Jing'an Temple. After a photograph, they set off for Kunshan. The road was newly paved with coal ash, not yet firm, making it very inconvenient for cycling, so the speed was not remarkable. They reached Kunshan at noon, everyone looking hungry. After lunch, they discussed group matters, elected service personnel, and discussed the return journey, which would take the railway route, for two or three hours. After a brief rest, it was already 3 PM, so they split into teams and departed from the railway station to return to Shanghai. The first team, mostly skilled riders, arrived in Shanghai around 8 PM. However, some members of the second team were weaker and could not withstand the long journey, so they were asked to take the train back first. Dealing with their train arrangements and the inconvenience of carrying bikes across dozens of bridges along the way took a lot of time. They did not arrive in Shanghai until around 10 PM, more than an hour behind the first team. Although the journey was arduous, the spirits of the team members were good. With continued effort, good results are expected in the future. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government is very willing to support the group's organization, and further progress is expected. It is now scheduled to travel to Songjiang this Sunday (September 8th). The time is set for 6:00 to 6:30 AM, gathering in front of the American School on Avenue Petain for departure. All members are requested to participate on time. For any questions, please send a letter to Post Office Box 256 for contact.</p>

Prizes are being solicited from various departments. The inter-departmental championship was originally scheduled for the 3rd and 4th, but was postponed due to rain and wet grounds. Only two singles matches and a doubles match were completed. It depends if the grounds are usable today to see whether it can continue. The results of the singles matches are that both groups were won by the general affairs department. The championship has been secured, so the remaining doubles match is no longer important. In yesterday's match, the mechanical department's lineup was temporarily changed to Zhou Xiong, replacing Xue Zhang. Both sides are first-class players, so the battle was very exciting. The results of the singles matches are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Singles: Zhou Jianwen (Mechanical) defeated Zhan Wenyao (Accounting) 6-2, 6-4, 6-2</p>
<p>Second Singles: Xiong Dachi (Mechanical) defeated Chen Jixiang (Accounting) 6-3, 6-3, 6-4</p>

<h3>Little Men (37)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>He thought no one would notice, but Tao Fei had seen him. When Amy mentioned it a few days later, Tao Mo spoke it out, which happened to be heard by Mr. Pei. At that time, the lesson was over, and they were all standing in the corridor. Mr. Pei had just sat on a long chair made of rattan poles and was playing with Tante. But when he heard what Tao Mo said and saw Ned's face flushed and looking at him with a look of fear, he put the child down and said, "Go to your mother, little darling, I will come." Then he took Ned's hand and led him into the classroom, and closed the door.</p>
<p>The children looked at each other in silence. After a while, Tao Mo slipped out. He looked in through a half-covered white leaf window and saw a sight that made him surprised. Mr. Pei had just taken down a rattan cane that was hanging high near the desk. Because it was rarely used, it was covered with dust.</p>
<p>"Oh, no! This time Ned is going to get a beating. I better not say anything," the sympathetic Tao Mo thought to himself, because being beaten was the greatest shame in this school.</p>
<p>"Do you remember what I told you last time?" Mr. Pei said to her, without any anger, but with great sorrow.</p>
<p>"Yes; but please don't make me do it, I can't bear it," Ned cried, backing away to the door with his hands behind his back, his face full of sadness.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't he stand up and take it like a hero? I would," Tao Mo thought, though his heart was also pounding when he saw this scene.</p>
<p>"I must keep my word, and you must remember to tell the truth. Ned, obey me: pick this up and hit me six times."</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Huanglian)</p>
<p>What is fate? What is luck?</p>
<p>Now there are some depressed and frustrated people who keep talking about fate! A person with great accomplishments can not only not overthrow the word fate, but is instead dominated by fate.</p>
<p>Some people also say: "The word fate can be interpreted as opportunity, because a person who can encounter opportunities everywhere is a person who has good luck!"</p>
<p>Napoleon of the Great Yuezhi? He once said to his subordinates: "What opportunity? I will create the opportunity!" It can be seen that the word opportunity, as long as we have perseverance and effort, can be created by each individual!</p>
<p>"Fate!" "Luck!" I don't know how much time has been wasted, and countless people have been misled!</p>
<p>Wake up! Those who are superstitious about "fame!" "luck!" Let us not be prisoners of "fate"!</p>
<h3>Chat</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>The human heart is indeed a strange thing. When a person is alive, his heart is always beating. Generally speaking, the rate of heart beating varies greatly, ranging from about forty-five beats per minute to one hundred and eighty beats per minute. It beats one hundred thousand times a day, and five hundred and forty pounds of blood flow through it every hour. If a person is a very hardworking worker, such as a coolie pushing a heavy cargo truck, or a rower participating in a rowing competition, then at least eighty gallons (unit of measurement) of blood flow in and out of his heart every minute.</p>
<p>A scientist once precisely calculated the distance that blood travels in the blood vessels of our body. The result is this: it travels seven miles per hour, one hundred and sixty-eight miles per day, and sixty-one thousand three hundred and twenty miles per year. If an eighty-year-old man has a blood cell in his blood vessels since childhood, floating around with the blood, then the number of miles it has floated is really amazing, because according to the above algorithm, it will almost travel five million miles.</p>
<p>The human heart is only a hollow piece of muscle, conical in shape, located between the two lungs. A normal heart is five inches long, two and a half inches thick, and three and a half inches at its widest part. A man's heart weighs ten to twelve ounces, and a woman's heart weighs eight to ten ounces.</p>
<p>In the first two years of life, the heart grows the fastest. The heart of a two-year-old child is twice as large as that of a newborn baby. Between the ages of two and seven, the heart doubles in size. Then it grows gradually, and by the age of fifteen, it has grown to a size that is practically adequate. But by the age of fifty, it will continue to grow, although the growth rate is very slow.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Zhang Chunfan</h3>
<p>— Jin Junren</p>
<p>According to a letter from a friend, Mr. Zhang Chunfan, the owner of Shuliu Shanfang Studio, has passed away due to illness. Another pioneer of fiction has fallen, which is truly lamentable. I, being unlearned and without literary talent, have in recent years been able to present my writings to the public in Shanghai newspapers and magazines, initially thanks to Mr. Zhang's encouragement. Now, upon hearing of his demise, I am filled with sorrow and express these few words to convey my condolences.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year of the Republic (1929), I lived in Tianjin, while Mr. Zhang was in Shanghai, independently running the *Ping Bao* three-day publication. His cousin, Qian Yuanhu, personally entrusted me with promoting it and also wrote a letter to introduce us to each other, thus forming a spiritual friendship. The following year, in March, I passed through Shanghai on business and met Mr. Zhang in person. He had a robust physique and an earnest, dignified appearance. Two months later, after my business was concluded, I returned to Tianjin and met him again. Mr. Zhang insisted on inviting me to a gathering at Wufangzhai the next day, even saying he would send someone to my lodging to fetch me. The next morning, the messenger did not arrive, so I strolled along the area of Fourth Avenue and Hankou Road. Upon returning to my lodging, I discovered that my wallet was missing, containing several dozen yuan for travel expenses. When I later told Mr. Zhang about this, he generously offered me money as a loan. Although the amount was not enough to cover everything, his generosity and willingness to help in times of need were truly admirable.</p>
<p>I met Mr. Zhang approximately four or five times, and there were quite a few noteworthy incidents during those encounters. One day, we were discussing the writings of various authors, and Mr. Zhang, in high spirits, spoke eloquently and at length. Suddenly, he turned to me and said, "What level do you think your writing is at?" I blushed and could not answer. Mr. Zhang said, "Why be so modest?" As he spoke, he took up a Shen paper and a brush, drawing three horizontal lines. Then, between the three lines, he wrote the characters "上 (shàng, upper)," "中 (zhōng, middle)," and "下 (xià, lower)." I hesitated, then wrote the four characters "中下之間 (zhōng xià zhī jiān, between middle and lower)." Mr. Zhang was delighted and said, "You still have self-awareness. With this attitude, there are no limits to what you can achieve!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang enjoyed drinking, and he always accompanied his drinks with rice. Using rice to chase liquor was his particular habit. The book *Nine-tailed Turtle* was written by Mr. Zhang in his youth, and Zhang Qiugu is Mr. Zhang himself. Whenever he spoke of this to me, he would reproach himself for his frivolity. His wife, Pei Juan, is Chen Wenjuan in the book, gentle, virtuous, and dignified, just as she is described. Alas! Since my farewell to Mr. Zhang in May of the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), I have constantly hoped to see him again. Little did I expect that this wish would not be fulfilled, and that life and death would have separated us. From now on, I will never be able to see Mr. Zhang again. Thinking of our past relationship, my sorrow is boundless!</p>
<p>Children: Dad, school is starting soon!</p>
<p>Unemployed Dad: Uh, but…</p>
<h3>The Story of the Crickets</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Because there isn't enough time during the day, I've mostly switched to reading the newspaper in bed at night. Lately, the news the newspaper brings doesn't seem to be in the "good" category! After reading a few headlines, I get a headache. There are many crickets chirping here and there in the yard, so my attention shifted to the crickets, and then I thought about stories about them again.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I liked to turn over bricks, dig up mud, and catch crickets. As soon as I caught one, I wanted to fight it with someone else's. Once, my cricket, which was half again as big as the other one, was defeated! The children watching all said my cricket was useless! How could such a big one be defeated by a small one! I went home in shame and resentment and smashed it on the ground to feed the ants, so angry that I didn't want to eat dinner that night. That year, after the White Dew solar term, I followed Uncle Longlegs from next door with his red-headed cricket to the "Autumn Excitement Bureau" to gamble on roulette. The opponent was a black-headed cricket. Someone who looked like a judge carefully weighed the "voltage" of both crickets and decided on how many "flowers" to bet. Then, the two crickets were released into the "gate basin" to begin the duel! The red-headed cricket of Uncle Longlegs was very imposing, baring its fangs and flapping its wings, looking like it wanted to bite the black-headed cricket to death with one bite. The opponent seemed afraid of it, turned its tail and retreated. Of course, it chased, the black one turned around as if trying to fight, but continued to retreat, retreat, straight from the center of the basin to the bottom edge! Uncle Longlegs was about to declare his cricket victorious, when suddenly, we saw a violent jumping and bouncing in the basin! We saw the ivory-colored bellies of the two crickets rolling and twisting together, and the eyes of the surrounding spectators flashed with horrified and tense glimmers! Suddenly, we heard a "thud," and a cricket was thrown out of the basin. The black-headed one in the basin bared its fangs and searched around for the opponent, still wanting to fight! It chirped triumphantly! Uncle Longlegs was really unlucky! He lost money and went home with "anger"!</p>
<p>This is called "Great courage seems like cowardice"! However, there must be "great courage" first, and then "seeming cowardice" has meaning and value. We must ignore the "seeming cowardice" of the black-headed cricket and value its "great courage"!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Qi's Faction Attempts to Align with and Flatter a Petty Official; The Matron's Fierce Temper Erupts, Annoying the Lady</p>
<p>No need to guess, it was Zhu Yueying crying. She couldn't get help from Commissioner Lan, and she still had to ask Jia Duocai many times, but she didn't dare to rush in rashly. She stood for a while, listening, and there was no other sound inside, only Zhu Yueying crying softly. She thought to herself that Jia Duocai was patient, allowing her to cry like this without making even a mosquito-sized sound. Seeing a tea servant passing by, she pointed to Jia Duocai's room and looked at the tea servant. He shook his head twice and smiled: "Mr. Jia is not at home." Only then did Jie Fu ask: "Mrs. Jia, what's wrong? May I come in?" Yueying said from inside, with a crying tone, "The door is locked from the outside." Jie Fu said: "That's nothing. If you want to come out, just ask the tea servant to open the door for you." Yueying said: "The tea servant doesn't dare to open the door. It's not that I want to open the door, I heard that my mother is sick, and I want to go back and see her, but Master Jia won't let me go," As she spoke, the crying inside suddenly intensified, and her voice stopped. Zhang Jiefu said: "You don't need to cry. When Mr. Jia comes back and sees your eyes swollen from crying, he will definitely be unhappy." Yueyang didn't reply, and continued to cry. At this time, a loud voice was heard upstairs, calling for the tea servant. Someone else said: "Call a tea servant downstairs, Commissioner Lan upstairs has something to ask." The tea servant who was talking to Jiefu was called Ma San, and he was the most resourceful tea servant in the entire Little Western Paradise Inn. (309)</p>
<h3>Records of Imperial Fragrance Vaguely Lingering</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In the morning, as soon as Her Old Ladyship got out of bed, a eunuch would hold a bowl of specially brewed tallow, respectfully approaching her. This tallow was different from the one used in food; it was thinner and mixed with floral dew, so it was very fragrant. The Empress Dowager would use her finger to lightly pick up some of it from the bowl, apply it to her palm to melt it gradually, and then apply it to her face, covering it completely. But she did not smear it haphazardly; she always proceeded very carefully.</p>
<p>The purpose of applying this tallow was to remove the layer of floral essence applied the night before, so it was necessary to cover the entire face and sit quietly for ten minutes before wiping off the oil with a soft towel. Next came the application of powder and rouge. This procedure never changed; it was like a fixed curriculum in school.</p>
<p>Her hands also needed to be smeared with tallow, but she was too lazy to do this part of the work herself; she always had us, the female officials, do it for her. We would first pick up a piece of oil and put it in our palms to melt it, then carefully apply it to the Empress Dowager's hands. The Empress Dowager's hands were truly strange; not only were they white and delicate, but they were also extremely soft, not at all inferior to those of young people like us. After we had smeared her hands with tallow, we had to wipe them off after a while. This step was truly troublesome, because the Empress Dowager had a very peculiar temper, forbidding us to wipe them with a towel; we had to gently pat them with a towel until they were dry and clean.

<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<p>— Zhurong Shi</p>
<p>Sauce is a kind of seasoning food in the family, which is widely used in dishes. People outside have seven things to do when they open the door, one of which is firewood, rice, oil, salt, etc. It can be seen that it is an important seasoning.</p>
<p>There are kinds of sauces, there are the difference between broad bean sauce and sweet sauce. In the sauce shop on the market, all are sold. Broad bean sauce is made of yellow broad beans, taste salty. Sweet sauce is made of broad beans and starch, taste slightly sweet. All the differences are in the different raw materials and different methods of making. However, the sauce sold in the sauce garden on the market is generally not very clean, the taste is also inferior, and in the summer season, it is often drunk by flies and gnats, and some even have unclean insects such as maggots, which are absolutely inappropriate in terms of hygiene, so the sauce used in the family should be homemade, which is clean and refreshing, and the taste is fresh and fat, compared with the sauce sold on the market, the beauty is really different.</p>
<p>The sauce made in the family is sweet bean sauce, and when the sauce is made, it must be within the second volt in summer, so that it can be placed for a long time without breaking. The so-called Volt sauce is the bean sauce and sweet sauce sold in the mountains, and are also known as Volt sauce.</p>
<p>The method of making sauce is to first take dry broad beans in the mold, soak them in water, expose them to sunlight, so that the bean skin is fat, take them out and peel off the skin, cook them into bean paste, mix them with starch and mix them, Chuan Li and become pieces, about one liter of beans, mix two pounds of starch, the pieces have been formed, that is, pinch them into long strips, put them into steaming molds and steam them until cooked, take them out and cut them into small pieces the size of playing cards, which is sauce yellow, put them in bamboo baskets or rattan buckets, put them in a shady and humid place, so that they ferment, After a few days, mold spots will appear on the sauce yellow, with a kind of musty smell, which is the phenomenon of fermentation, and after a few more days of work, the fermentation has passed, then expose them to strong sunlight, the sauce yellow will gradually dry, and the sauce yellow will also become yellow, At this time, the sauce yellow has been successfully made. In the dog days of June, it is the date of making sauce. Use a sauce jar, which should be a tile jar with a large opening and a small bottom, which is convenient for exposure to the sun. On the day of making the sauce, weigh the sauce yellow, about one catty of sauce yellow, use two and a half or four taels of salt, soak in salt water, wait for the salt water to cool thoroughly, put the sauce yellow into the jar, inject salt water, to the extent that it is immersed in the sauce yellow, from now on, put the sauce jar in the courtyard where it can be exposed to sunlight, and dry it in the sun every day, After three days, the sauce yellow will gradually dissolve, and you can take out the sauce yellow and stir it, so that it is mixed in the salt water, and then gradually expose it to the sun. Every day you dry it, a layer of red color will appear on the surface of the sauce. At this time, every morning, the sunlight has not yet dried, but the sauce is cold because it has passed overnight. You can use a sauce stick to stir it, so that the red layer on the surface is mixed with the bottom, so after a period of sunlight, the color of the sauce will gradually turn from yellow to red, and from red to purple, it will become a delicious sweet sauce. When drying the sauce, in order to prevent rain from entering, there must be a waterproof jar lid on the jar, which can be opened during the day to be exposed to sunlight, and can be covered at night to prevent the intrusion of rain and dew, and in order to prevent the entanglement of flies and gnats, causing the growth of worms, a gauze cover must be prepared, covered on the jar, so that the sauce made can be guaranteed to be clean. After the sauce is made, it can be placed in a small-mouthed tile jar, tightly sealed, and when you want to use it, open the seal and take out the amount of Chuanchuan, and then seal it tightly, so that even if it is stored for a long time, it will not break, and it can be used all year round, without causing corruption. If it is packed, you can often dry it in the sun, and it can be stored for a long time. The taste of the sauce, even after one or two years, will not change!</p>

<h3>Securities - Many Selling Public Bonds Short - Market Prices Do Not Easily Rise - Trading Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market price of public bonds trended towards extreme stagnation. The quietness of trading was unprecedented. Bulls and bears held their positions, with barriers heavily pressed, each with different targets and views. Market prices also encountered difficulties due to the excessively low forward market prices, and arbitrage trading was impossible. Because many were selling short in the forward market, market prices were even less likely to rise. No. 48 mostly leaned towards selling, and the northern traders also mostly sold more than they bought. No. 5 had quite a bit of buying. Market prices hovered [unclear], and the trend is likely to remain in a stagnant situation. Yesterday, trading was more active in the morning and extremely quiet in the afternoon. The overall trend of the day was that continuation bonds were the strongest. Other types mostly hovered between five cents and one dime. Market prices were vaguely uncertain.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Japanese Yarn Cheap - Marked Yarn Wants to Rise but Turns Back</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation softened again. Because the selling price of Japanese yarn is cheaper than Chinese yarn, people are sluggish. However, traders, seeing that the stock in warehouses is gradually shrinking, are tightening and firmly refusing to loosen. However, sellers appear again when prices are high. In short, the environment is not very good, so the market is still difficult to solidify, and the overall trend still does not escape a hovering situation.</p>
<p>Certain Yarns Fell More Than They Rose</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market this morning, prices rose consistently for all months, and the situation became increasingly acute. Market commentators said that the stored yarn has decreased and there is a lack of chips, and the market should have bullish intentions. A certain company also came to buy in large quantities, with a particularly large amount, causing the market to tighten. The first lot prices for all months rose by one yuan, while the second and third lots remained unchanged. By the close of the market, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were sluggish, falling by a few dimes. As a result, the current month rose by 1.3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, and distant months rose by 6.7 and 9 dimes. The afternoon opening suddenly showed weakness, with a lack of buyers. After buying in the morning, a certain company was satiated and did not move in the afternoon. Sellers took the opportunity to attack, and the first and third lots fell step by step. As a result, the near months fell by 7.9 dimes compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months fell by 1 yuan to 1.1 yuan. However, Osaka Sampin yarn, having fallen for many days, rebounded and rose by 2 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Merchants Take Advantage of High Prices to Hedge Sales, Market Suffers Another Setback</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, and the market state became increasingly calm. As new cotton from all sides poured into the market, those with goods slightly hedged sales when prices rose. The afternoon market had some signs of clearing, and people suddenly felt tired, and a selling trend rose again, and the market declined.</p>
<p>Cotton Rose in the Morning and Retraced in the Afternoon</p>

Hexing sold off the most. The prices for each lot in each month rose by 2.1 dimes compared to the morning closing price. The afternoon opening suddenly weakened, and the market situation was more frustrated. Because the weather cleared and the sun shone, sellers gathered and came, and the market surface suddenly became loose. As a result, the October price fell by 3.5 dimes compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months fell by 2.3 dimes. It was found that Dafu sold 2,000 loads, Tongji sold 1,000 loads, Dafeng sold 4,500 loads, Zhengda sold 1,000 loads, Hexing sold 3,500 loads, Taichang sold 2,000 loads, Yuanyu Chang sold 5,700 loads, Changhe sold 1,500 loads, and Yongda sold 800 loads.

It was reported that there would be strong winds and rain in the Atlantic provinces, so people were very optimistic.

<h3>Grain - Future Flour Trading Remains Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw Chicago rise 14 dimes, and Canada rise one dime. The market sentiment was positive due to favorable reports from overseas. The torrential rain the night before had turned [unclear] firm. Furthermore, as the situation in East Africa became increasingly serious, the buying enthusiasm from [unclear] also continued to follow, and the market [unclear] rose by two cents. By the afternoon opening, transactions were historically active, with the market seeing near month declines and distant month gains. The current month has trended sideways due to factory hedging, while distant month futures saw short covering and off-market entrants, still trending upwards. Afterwards, if international problems occur, we should continue to look for good results. As a result, the current month rose by half a cent, October rose by three cents, November rose by two and a half cents, December rose by two and seven tenths of a cent, January rose by two and a half cents, and [unclear] month rose by three cents.</p>
<h3>Both Future and Spot Wheat are Profitable</h3>
<p>After the opening of yesterday's wheat futures market, all months showed good results. Because overseas reports showed a rise of two, three, or four dimes, and the spot wheat market value was tight, the opening prices for each month were better by two or three cents. By the afternoon opening, because the flour market was still tight, short covering was seen among traders, so the opening price gradually improved. According to overseas wheat, it is not profitable, and the base of national wheat is being used up more and more. If there is an opportunity, people's hearts will easily be [unclear]. As a result, September and October each rose by five cents, and October rose by six cents. The spot wheat market also became profitable, because the arrival of goods was not smooth. Customers pushed up prices for the goods that arrived, so they were raised by two or three cents. Kaishan Dong Wheat opened at 3.65 yuan, Yanghe Yaowan Wheat opened at 1.64 yuan, Jiangxin Zhou Wheat opened at 3.57 yuan, Jiangbei Wheat opened at 3.58 yuan, and Shaheji Wheat opened at 36.62 yuan [sic] , with 800 bags going to Fuxin and 3,100 bags going to Xinda.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat September 3 September 4</p>
<p>December 89.625 91.000 Up 1.375</p>

<p>Canadian Wheat September 3 September 4 Fluctuation</p>
<p>December 82.25 82.875 Down 0.125</p>
<h3>Wheat Bran Factories Open Less</h3>
<p>The wheat bran market is still stable, with a bid price of 2.15 yuan, but the factories are not willing to open. Although there are not many transactions at this price, the foreign firms are telegraphing for October orders at 2.20 yuan, so spot goods are inevitably [unclear]. If demand is smooth in the future, we must look at the good side.</p>
<h3>Rice Continues to Show Excellence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 20 [unclear] boats arrived in South Shanghai (goods totaling about 4,000 stones). Both retail and wholesale markets were sluggish. Qingdao firms only processed over 400 bags. It suddenly rained, and people's hearts were slightly revived. The market color was slightly tight. If various thick japonica and thin rice are still not showing much glory or disgrace, various new japonica rice is rising by two dimes, because the new japonica price of Xin Chang Factory's [unclear] Jiaxiang Gu Renji household is 9 yuan in silver dollars, while the new pointed rice from Yangchuan and other places is more popular, and sales are sluggish. The market color has softened, and prices have depreciated outside of the scale. Yesterday, 234 boats arrived in North Shanghai from various river routes. The sales of various goods in the market, white japonica rice, and high-quality ingredients continued to sell, and medium and second-quality rice were sold at the same price. The market situation was slightly alarming and changed to laborious. Thin rice was [unclear] selling lively, and the price situation was upright. The overall glory and disgrace of white yuan, Dongxin [unclear] Because of the yin [unclear] in the sky, 500 stones arrived, and market sales were quite active. The price was increased by two dimes. The new Yangjian rice that arrived was still not much, and retail sales were not good. The market situation was [unclear] stable, medium-quality and second-quality were thin and expensive, and the remaining goods were stable.</p>
<h3>Yongxiang [type of rice] Rises Sharply by More Than 3 Dimes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign-style Xiang rice rose across the board. Especially because the arrival of Xiang rice was scarce, the appetite of this street has always been lively. Yesterday, there were even inquiries from inland areas. The 775 newly arrived bags were all cleared. The high and low grades both rose by one dime and a half to one dime. And the Zhongguan Yongxiang rice was welcomed by the merchants, and the price was sharply higher by 3 to 3.3 dimes. Because the customer Xiang rice has been lacking for two days, the foreign rice stock has dried up and the production price is high, and people have already hoped for good results. In addition, the European and African war opportunities are increasing, which is more emphasized by the customers and domestic households. The foreign rice market also rose by seven or eight cents to more than one dime. Throughout the day, 2,000 bags of Saigon rice, 1,700 bags of small pressed rice, and 560 bags of [unclear] rice were opened, and most were purchased by the customers on this street.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Foreign Firms' Tea Market is in a Dismal State</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign firm tea market became increasingly quiet. English and French firms and Hangzhou firms are all unwilling to search for and hoard purchases because of the tightening of overseas recognition prices and the gradual increase in exchange rates in recent times unless they are in urgent need. Therefore, transactions were unusually sparse. Yesterday, only Tongfu, Baochang, Yih和, Meixing, and Jinlong, among other firms, purchased a total of more than 200 boxes of Zhenmei, Xiami, Gongxi, and Fengmei, among other items. The market fell consistently, and the market was extremely pessimistic.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods - Black Melon Seeds Rise Steadily Without Stopping</h3>
<p>Recently, black melon seeds have not arrived in large quantities, and land prices are gradually tightening. In addition, the price of the king of melon seeds on this street is coming, and the F[unclear] Preparatory Company is eating the stomach [unclear]. People are approving receipts. Because the Chinese opening price is also gradually [unclear] Yesterday's market [unclear] 80 bags opened at 14.2 yuan, and Mingguang opened 152 at 9.4 yuan, which is a rise of one yuan for the large grains and almost one yuan for the small grains compared to the lower ten days of last month. It was heard that Xu Kuile Chen's goods also cost 14 yuan, which is a difference of 5 yuan from [unclear]. The situation is still [unclear] to rise again.</p>
<p>Saving the disaster is saving lives. Donate one more penny and save one more life.</p>
<h3>Hardware - Black Iron Sheet Sales Market is Active</h3>
<p>Recently, Tianjin and Qingdao firms have continued to purchase black iron sheets, and the hot water bottle factory on this street is being launched on the market, so the demand is quite strong. The total transaction volume in the city reached 500 to 600 bundles, and the standard soared. For example, 2-foot 6-inch 18-sheet patterns were opened at 8.5 yuan per bundle, a good rise of 5 dimes. One or two foot six inch three-sheet to ten-sheet were opened at 7.5 yuan, and eleven-sheet to thirteen-sheet were opened at 8.25 yuan, which is also an increase of two or three dimes to five or six dimes compared to the past. In addition, a kind of "wild chicken" product, the Nei Zheng brand goods have risen, so recently they have also improved a lot. It was heard that the market price per bundle has also risen to 7.12 yuan.</p>

<h3>On the Inability to Improve Old Operas</h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>I don't know what basis Mei Lanfang has for the three advantages of old operas praised by the Russian, and I don't know what basis he has. The Soviet Russian theater world has Stanislavsky, Meyerhold and other masters, and no one would make such nonsense, or at most, it is just a diplomatic term between international circles. The so-called Chinese opera in two terms cannot be established. In the past, Chinese opera had many different kinds, and the Peking Opera was the worst. It was actually a remnant of the Kun Opera, minor opera and Henan Opera after their degeneration. To represent Chinese opera with Peking Opera is presumptuous. The first point mentioned: including singing, dialogue, dancing, and martial arts, is a mixed art combining various techniques. The name mixed art is ridiculous to use. Moreover, Peking Opera has no dancing. It doesn't move when it sings, and doesn't sing when it acts. Occasionally, there are places with singing and dancing, which are all regulations inherited from Yuan Opera. Opera and spoken drama have their own styles and cannot be considered advantages.</p>
<p>Second: Chinese stage equipment and color [unclear] movement are most in line with the principles of stage economy without losing their beauty. One Peking Opera has no stage settings (Kun Opera is also). If possible, it imitates everything as much as possible; if it is impossible, it simplifies it as much as possible; and the Qing Dynasty court opera and the local grass-roots opera troupe are representatives of the two extremes. Only the costumes of old operas have their own scale and are one of the central elements (see below), but they do not pay attention to the color matching. The situation of ancient European drama is the same as this. In the Shakespeare era, it was a neutral or non-functional background and gorgeous costumes. But people have already surpassed it.</p>
<p>Third: One Chinese opera actor's every move has a fixed way, which can be used freely in various scripts. And the actor's performance talent is not bound by the fixed way. "The stylization of the movements of old operas is the point that people who advocate old operas boast the most about, and they also tout it as a symbol. However, everyone knows that all the simple movements of old operas are neither the basic form of the stage nor a symbol, but just the remnants left after the degeneration of low-level realism. For example, waving the whip to represent the horse is not enough to express the horse's emotions, nor is it enough to show the idea of riding a horse. However, after being exhausted in imitation, the easiest method is taken to temporarily replace it, and it is mixed with childish delusion (such as the banquet of children playing house). If possible, they will immediately go to the position of imitating real objects. Real knives and guns and real [unclear] on stage will always be the call of the theater, right?</p>
<p>But how can it be said that old operas cannot be improved? Because the central elements of old operas are music and costumes. The script does not occupy an important position. The action is transferred due to the costume. The stage setting originally did not exist. Now it is reluctantly added, and it is transformed into a mechanism set. Therefore, if the former music and costumes cannot be improved, even if the other parts of the old opera are changed, it will not have much impact. If music and costumes can be improved, then it will be completely another matter, and it will definitely not be the current old opera.</p>
<p>It has been clarified that Chinese opera is transferred by music, which is undeniable. Peking Opera originated from the people and was created by people without musical literacy, so the tone is the simplest and the instruments used are the worst. The Peking Opera main music huqin does not have any [unclear] position in Chinese instrumental music. However, no one can improve (Mr. Yu has admitted when discussing the national opera movement) or is willing to reform even this simple and crude music. Therefore, [unclear] there is no possibility of improvement.</p>
<p>As for reforming the script, people have been practicing it repeatedly for 30 years without any effect. The earliest ones were Wang [unclear], Liu Yizhou, etc. Ouyang Yuqian, who had artistic accomplishment and created original scripts, has been around for more than ten years. The most enduring and large-scale one is the Yisushe in Shaanxi, which is called upon by celebrities and scholars, such as Zhao Taiyou and Yu Shangyuan. The Jiangxi NuLi Troupe is completely a publicity attempt. There are many other newly compiled and reduced versions from time to time! But where is the effect? The old opera still stands still, not losing its original appearance and month. Therefore, it is too superficial to talk about reforming old opera with the focus only on the script. As for saying that old opera is the remnant of feudal ideology and [unclear] obscene and instigates theft, there is no need to talk about it, because it is not enough to convince the hearts of those who advocate old opera, but they are really unable to reform it.</p>
<p>Stage settings cannot be reformed either. Old operas only need a neutral background. An embroidered picture of pine and cranes or the sea and sun is also possible, as is the general who comes out and the prime minister who enters and other plaques, and it is also possible to have nothing. It is recognized by those who advocate old opera that machine sets are not enough to increase the value of old opera.</p>
<p>Action cannot be reformed either. When it comes to the wide range of script materials, the complexity of the tones, and the beauty of the movements, Peking Opera is far inferior to Kun Opera. Because it is restricted by the principle of singing but not dancing (this is really an unevolved primitive state, because Chinese opera originally evolved from only singing suites, Lianxiang, and similar storytelling Xixiang, etc., so after a little further progress, singing and dancing are still not related to each other.) ), so the range of activities that can be carried out is limited. In addition, the action is transferred with the costume; the action of the old opera is entirely determined by the costume of the old opera. It is impossible to talk about reforming the action without first reforming the costume.</p>
<p>And who can reform the costumes of old operas? Among the various old operas, the difference in tone is the largest, and the difference in costumes is the smallest, so the costumes are the most fixed and not easy to change.</p>
<p>To sum up, Peking Opera really has no hope of improvement; if there is one, then it will only be until the future musician, at that time there may be a new opera, but there must be a musician first, after establishing our country's music.</p>
<h3>Half-Hour Work System</h3>
<p>— Chen Jingsheng</p>
<h3>Seesaw (5)</h3>
<p>— Bai Chen</p>
<p>The little monk was so engrossed in watching that he took off running. His playmate shouted, "Hey! This way!"</p>
<p>He ran past the whitewashed wall, and sure enough, there was a small door. He poked his head in for a look, "Wow!" There were so many people inside! All of them were like monkeys, without clothes or pants. Some even wore pointy hats, making them look even more like performing monkeys!</p>
<p>When the ball went east, the monkeys scrambled east; when the ball rolled west, the monkeys also ran west. They squeezed together, rolled together, even more fun than a performance!</p>
<p>The little monk was just getting lost in watching when a small kid pushed him. "That way!" He looked in the direction of her hand, and there was another door to the north. Seven or eight kids, about the same size as him and her, were crowded in front of the door, craning their necks to look inside. They stared with their eyes wide, mouths open, without a sound. Then, suddenly, they burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Huh?" the two of them squeezed into the crowd. Here, there was a barred gate. They could see, but couldn't get in. The little monk pressed his face against the bars. Hey, look!</p>
<p>These weren't the monkeys! It was all kids about their age. One group to the east, another to the west. Kicking balls, jumping rope... they had everything. Oh, what was that at the base of the wall over there? A tall frame. Kids climbed up the ladder on one side and slid down the board on the other. "Whee!..." One came down. "Whee!..." Another one. Every time one landed, the little monk's heart jumped. The little girl was the same. There was even one kid who was really strange, sliding down head first. "Whee!..." Just as his head was about to hit the ground, he flipped over and stood up.</p>
<p>"Ah!..." A few kids outside the fence laughed.</p>
<p>Look, what was that again at the base of the wall on this side? A frame with a long wooden plank on it, about one or two "zhang" long. A kid sat on each end of the plank. This one went up, that one came down; that one went up, this one came down again. Ah, they see-sawed so high! The one on top was yelling, the one below was laughing. The little girl's and the little monk's hearts also beat faster and faster. When someone went up, their bodies loosened and their stomachs pushed out. When someone came down, their behinds sank and their waists softened.</p>
<p>"Brother!..." The little girl looked at her brother, with a bellyful of words she couldn't say.</p>
<p>The little monk also turned to look for his mother, who happened to be walking over.</p>
<p>"Mom!..." the little monk wanted to say something.</p>
<p>His mother said, "Let's go, we're almost there!"</p>
<p>Neither of them wanted to leave. They dragged their mother over to watch. The little monk said, "It's fun, Mom!"</p>
<p>His mother peeked inside. "Oh! It's really good! So many kids!"</p>
<p>"Mom!" the little girl raised her head.</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"Let's go in and play...." a low voice.</p>
<h3>Farewell</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>These days pass too slowly; although it has only been two days since I saw him off, it feels even longer than two years!</p>
<p>I can't analyze my emotions. Why have I been so fragile lately, bursting into tears so easily? But sometimes, I admire myself for having a reason stronger than cast iron, which suppresses my fiery emotions, forcing me to live a calm life. However, since six o'clock yesterday morning until now, I have been living in my emotions; completely lost my reason. I didn't shed tears, really. I watched the car drive away, he waved his hat, I held his hand. In an instant, the shadow of the car disappeared. All I could hear were the hurried honks of the horn. Although tears blurred my vision, I walked into the city gate as if I were blind. The suppressed tears never flowed.</p>
<p>Really, I haven't shed a single tear in two days. But my heart, ah! God, what words can I use to describe my pain? I need him to come back immediately, or a pistol by my side. But both hopes are impossible. So, when will my suffering end? God!</p>
<p>Yesterday passed in a daze. I thought he had gone out to collect insects and would be back for dinner. But today I am awake, completely awake! I understand that he really left me, alone on that unfamiliar, distant journey! I am alone in this empty, spacious house. Ah! This house is terribly empty, it locks me in like an ancient city – like a motherless lamb, a stray goose separated from its flock. Looking out the window, there are balsam and cockscomb flowers withered by the sun, a small bird in a cage with its feathers falling out, and butterflies dancing among the flowers. But I don't want to look at the flowers, nor do I want to look at the butterflies. I only sigh at the small bird locked in the cage. I don't know when it came to the cage. Since losing its freedom, it has been running around and chirping in the cage all day long. Looking at the feathers on its body falling out one by one, its belly getting thinner and thinner, even the water put in by the school worker is kicked over by its struggling feet, and it doesn't eat. Ah! I deeply taste the anxiety and sorrow of that little bird! I am a big bird, locked in a big cage. Although I am more free than it, and can open the door of the cage and run out, there is a bigger cage outside the big cage, which you can never fly out of no matter how hard you try. What is the difference between my life and the little bird's? None at all.</p>
<p>This morning, I spent my time in the hospital. Dr. Tang is a friend of Manna's, and also the older sister of my friend Wanqiu. Because of this multiple friendly relationship, she is particularly concerned about my illness and examined and treated me very carefully. When she saw me today, she was surprised at why my face looked so bad. I told her that I hadn't been feeling well, that I'd had a terrible headache for the past two days, and that I felt like I was going to faint all the time. She said, "You must be lacking sleep. You are not paying attention to your body. If you've reached this point, you must take special care of yourself!"</p>
<p>What could I say to her? Should I tell her I have insomnia? I listened silently to her earnest advice, my heart filled with gratitude and shame.</p>
<p>"I'll prescribe two kinds of tonics for you to take today. If you are still like this next time, you will have to take more expensive tonics; but you need to pay for the medicine."</p>
<p>She said this seriously after looking at my sallow and thin face.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>My voice was so soft that I could barely hear it myself. I thought to myself that her friendship with me wasn't that deep after all, she couldn't be considered my "confidante." How could my illness be cured by a few packets of powder and a few bottles of liquid? She didn't even know that I could only afford medicine that didn't cost money.</p>
<p>(Here at the Provincial Hospital, there are free clinics from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM. No medical fees are charged, only two big copper coins for registration, whether it's the first visit or a follow-up.)</p>
<p>After leaving the hospital, I accompanied Ying to Mulong Cave at her request. The old couple selling sweet wine eggs and peanuts still greeted me with the same smiles as when Wei and I went there that day. But my mood wasn't as happy as that day. I mechanically bought two piles of peanuts, ate them, and left.</p>
<p>When it was time for lunch, I brought the rice to my mouth, but it was as hard to swallow as chewing sand. Even my favorite stir-fried shrimp with cabbage tasted like chewing dry leaves. I finally put down my chopsticks after eating less than half a bowl.</p>
<p>It was already 6:30 PM. It was raining heavily outside. I had just eaten a bowl of sand-like rice, and I'm still holding the last bite in my mouth as I write these words made of pain. I dare not tell Wei about my life these past two days. I am afraid he will scold me. He wants me to live a purely rational life, not to let emotions ruin my future. "First, get your health back, then read more books and write more!" On the morning of his departure, when the sky was still only greyish-white, he said to me sadly. This is his expectation, and also his command. How could I not obey?</p>
<p>He also said, "Women can't do great things because they always live in their emotions and don't use their brains to think about anything." I have argued with him several times, and resolved to be someone whose reason is stronger than emotion. No, someone whose reason completely controls their emotions. But it was no use. Even if you understand that you shouldn't be ruled by emotions, in fact, reason has already been defeated. Who knows where it has run off to? What can be done?</p>
<p>I remember it was three years ago in the autumn when Gou took a late train to Nanjing and then transferred to the Jinpu Railway to go north. Her family and I all went to see her off. Soon, the person holding the red and green flags blew the whistle and waved the red flag. The train began to move. At that time, Mr. Yazi was still holding Gou's hand tightly and wouldn't let go. Later, the train moved faster, and he even ran after the train as if flying. I quickly rushed to hold him back. He was trembling all over. At the time, I couldn't say any words of comfort, I just shed two hot tears with him – tears of being moved by "fatherly love."</p>
<p>"Why are you so sad?" I wanted to ask him, but immediately felt that it was a "foolish question." The words that reached my lips retracted again. But I never understood why he loved Gou so much. The mother didn't shed tears, but when her daughter was taken to Beiping, he was so reluctant to part, so sad. I once asked him, "Don't you have any reason?" "Yes, I have no reason, and I don't understand what reason is!" At the time, I was surprised that he could say such definite and firm words. At the same time, I blamed myself for being too rash. It was impolite to speak to an elder like that. However, my words had already been spoken. Luckily, Mr. Yazi was able to forgive me, and didn't hold my rashness in his mind afterwards.</p>
<p>"I have no reason, and I don't understand what reason is!" At the time, I felt that these two sentences were a bit too emotional, even a bit absurd. But now I am in that same situation. "I have no reason, and I don't understand what reason is!"</p>
<p>The rain is getting heavier and heavier. Wei, are you writing to me in a dark carriage by the dim light of a small lamp, or are you lying on the ship's plank listening to the sound of raindrops hitting the drying rack and shedding tears?</p>
<h3>Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Xu Xu</p>
<p>Struggling to grow from poverty,</p>
<p>And struggling to return in illness.</p>
<p>This is the history of your life,</p>
<p>A tragedy of wrestling with life.</p>
<p>Now, you have fallen,</p>
<p>The battle passes to your son:</p>
<p>Use iron shoulders to shoulder everything,</p>
<p>I too will try to play a tragic role.</p>
<p>You forged strength from the hoe handle,</p>
<p>And carved will from heavy burdens:</p>
<p>Youth was eroded by wind and rain,</p>
<p>But it also created some achievements.</p>
<p>Fate would not let you be idle,</p>
<p>Even though you were exhausted:</p>
<p>A string of hail fell in your dream,</p>
<p>Destroying your hope.</p>
<p>Your gloomy eyes still burn with anger,</p>
<p>Your desolate cough replaces a sad song:</p>
<p>Now that you have fallen, the terrifying life</p>
<p>Again clutches your son—me!</p>
<p>I cannot cry loudly at your grave,</p>
<p>Nor do I have sorrowful tears like a bursting flood:</p>
<p>I only grit my teeth and temper myself,</p>
<p>Preparing for another bout with life!</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of farmers have fallen,</p>
<p>Your fate is not alone.</p>
<p>Let your nightmare also rest peacefully in the tomb,</p>
<p>The storm of the times is already howling.</p>
<p>You shouldn't reproach my foolishness, right?</p>
<p>I won't flatter, nor will I become rich:</p>
<p>Just like an ant doing its job.</p>
<p>To overcome our destiny,</p>
<p>There are only two bloody words: "Wrestling."</p>

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Chinese Council Seat in the League of Nations Executive Council Can Hopefully Be Realized</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The League of Nations Executive Council meeting, which will convene on the fourth of this month, will not only discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but also the issue of the Chinese Council seat, which will also be on the agenda. This matter is of great importance to our country's international status. Therefore, as the League of Nations Executive Council is about to hold a meeting, I would like to report the process of our country's efforts to re-enter the Executive Council to the readers. I believe that those who are concerned about national affairs will be happy to hear this.</p>
<p>Since our country was defeated in the re-election of non-permanent council members at the League of Nations General Assembly in September of last year, with 21 votes against Turkey's 48 votes, we have hoped to obtain a special seat on the Executive Council. However, the issue could not be submitted to the General Assembly unless all members of the Executive Council first unanimously agreed. Therefore, since that time, our country's diplomatic personnel stationed in Europe have begun to carry out efforts and contacted various countries separately. In May of this year, when the League of Nations Executive Council convened a regular meeting, Ambassador Guo, stationed in the United Kingdom, saw that the negotiations had been very satisfactory, and sent a formal memorandum to Litvinov, the chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council, requesting that China obtain a seat on the Executive Council. As a result of the discussions that day, the memorandum was unanimously approved in principle and it was decided to submit it to the Executive Council meeting in September for open discussion, and then submit it to the General Assembly. This is a rough overview of our country's efforts to obtain a council seat. It is said that British diplomat Eden expressed to Ambassador Guo his willingness to vigorously support China's re-entry into the Executive Council. Also, at the League of Nations Association General Assembly convened in Brussels in June of this year, there was also a resolution to assist China in obtaining a council seat on the League of Nations Executive Council. Judging from the various situations mentioned above, at this current League of Nations Executive Council regular meeting, the issue of our country's council seat may have the possibility of being realized, and it is not known.</p>
<p>I would like to further describe a few reasons why our country is requesting re-entry into the League of Nations Executive Council. First, since China's defeat last year and Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations taking effect this year, the League of Nations Executive Council has lacked an Asian representative. Second, based on the League of Nations' prestige and the foundation of international cooperation, it is necessary for China to participate in the Executive Council. Third, China is in an important position in Asia and has the qualifications to represent Asia at the Executive Council. Fourth, the Far East issue is very serious, and China should have close contact with the League of Nations. Fifth, China has always trusted the League of Nations and cooperated with the League of Nations, and its relationship is very close. Mota, the chairman of the First Committee of the Seventh League of Nations General Assembly, said at the time because of advocating enriching the Asian representatives of the Executive Council, that we cannot underestimate the demands of the great masses of Asia in front of us, especially in the future, and their increasingly powerful situation. Therefore, according to the above-mentioned reasons, China's shouldering responsibility to re-participate in the Executive Council is indeed a factual and proper request. I do not know what the Executive Council will decide.</p>
<h3>Autumn Scenery of Daming Lake</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>The footsteps of autumn drift from the north with the wind to Jinan, to the Daming Lake in Jinan, cruising over the reeds of Daming Lake. This is a common thing: Autumn comes every year, coming to the human world to make a long and low appeal to people: whenever you quietly hear a sound drifting by, that is him speaking.</p>
<p>For a period of time, I lived in an inn not far from Daming Lake, looking for work. I often spent my mornings on the lake.</p>
<p>When the morning breeze caressed the earth, and the rosy clouds were woven into the eastern</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>sky, I came here again.</p>
<p>There are naturally very few people, and there is simply no sound. No one wants to disturb everyone's quiet mood with a ripple, stepping lightly, lightly, enjoying an autumn morning light. I carried a notebook, like others, walking along the stone embankment, taking advantage of my extra clarity of mind, and opening the notebook to read a few pages is always a rare joy in the world.</p>
<p>The reeds seem to be the first to feel the autumn. Although it is just the beginning of autumn, you can already see the changes in the colors of Daming Lake. During the year, you see the tender green drawn out in spring; you see the dark green in summer; you see the gray and white in winter: in this autumn, what we see in front of us is like an elderly nun wearing a body of sentimental colors: an indescribable taste rises in my heart when you lonely see that kind of color. Especially a wanderer, seeing the golden wind blowing the arrival of the end of the world, wants to sing a song that makes people shed tears even more.</p>
<p>Lixia Pavilion is not the pavilion of the past: it is no longer the old style. It has now been replaced with a new autumn shirt, a layer of beautiful paint. The morning sun throws out gentle light from the east, and the yellow tiles reflect light from different angles, unlike the way it used to be: an ancient temple, with no glory to be seen.</p>
<p>Although there are fewer people boating, the boats are damaged due to disrepair, and long lines are at Sijia Wharf, Quehua Bridge, Beiji Pavilion, Qianqianjianmenli, etc. Sometimes a few celebrities or tourists from other places still come to play, but very rarely.</p>
<p>But, I don't run into them every morning.</p>
<p>Only a few college students in suits are walking back and forth. The police are walking or exercising with measured steps. On a few tall, withered trees, by the crow's nest, a few black heads peek out. The stream flows through the stone beach with a "gurgling..." sound. If you stand on a small bridge or on the long embankment held by reeds, and listen to the natural rhythm of the flowing water, or the low, faint, self-satisfied chirping: if you are not afraid of the cold water, understand crabs, see the crab holes clearly, and reach out, you can feel out a fat crab, or see silver fish turning over their snow-white bellies.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from a friend in the north, asking me about the news of autumn, and reporting to me on the recent situation of Daming Lake. He said, "Autumn in Daming Lake is like a strong glass of wine. When you first approach him, you feel fresh and prickly. You love his color (so deep), you love his taste, (so rich), you love his personality (quiet like an old maid), you love his demeanor (so comforting), but when you have been close to him for a long time, you hate his taste, his color, his personality, his demeanor, you will see him and get tired of him..."</p>
<p>Maybe I haven't been close to him for a long time yet, seeing his letter makes me even more attached to Daming Lake.</p>
<h3>Autumn Scenery</h3>
<p>— Jiang Mi</p>
<h3>Autumn Silkworms</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Li Laowu, who sells silkworm eggs, has been delayed in the Dongyuan teahouse for half a month. There are very few people taking care of his business. Are the people in the countryside not planning to raise autumn silkworms? No, because it is a matter of making some money to subsidize their families, they will do their best. There are two reasons why they have been slow to buy silkworm eggs from Li Laowu. One is that those who do not own mulberry fields have not yet collected the money to order leaves. The second is that the rice harvest is still uncertain, and they are not sure. If the autumn harvest is hopeless, where will the capital for raising silkworms come from? The sluggish market has made the villagers more and more timid. "Even big banks outside are going bankrupt, let alone us..." They say this all the time. They can no longer bear some economic risks.</p>
<p>Li Laowu left the dock because he couldn't find any business, but everyone became anxious again. Without silkworm eggs, they couldn't raise autumn silkworms. This year, the price of silk has improved a bit, and no one wants to give up this last season of silkworms. Therefore, everyone is running around to find ways to buy silkworm eggs, and the price has also increased by about ten cents. Regardless of whether they are Eagle Brand or Tiger Brand, improved varieties are usually sold for forty cents each. The county has issued a notice prohibiting private price increases, but vendors always have excuses, saying they need to subsidize travel expenses. Because of the tight timing, the villagers have to admit their losses and buy them. Lu Hongkun from Dongbatou spent one dollar and twenty cents to buy two sheets. This money was still obtained by pawning his cotton quilt?</p>
<p>When the second sleep silkworms started eating leaves, Lu Hongkun and his wife and daughter had no free time day and night. On the one hand, they were busy feeding them, and on the other hand, they had to worry about the leaves running out. He originally had five or six mu of mulberry fields in the west of the village, but he had already contracted them to Uncle Da Yan in the summer for one yuan and seventy-five cents per dan. Uncle Da Yan doesn't raise silkworms, but he lends money to do this business. Now he is selling it for three yuan and forty cents. When the harvest of the silkworm farmers who work hard and work hard is still in the sky, he is making money readily and without any effort. Lu Hongkun went to Uncle Da Yan to discuss owing two dan of leaves, but was rejected. He ran past his own mulberry field, and his heart full of sadness turned into tears that rolled to the corners of his eyes. He couldn't figure it out: "Why can't silkworm farmers get mulberry leaves? Why can't I cut the leaves in my own mulberry field? Why do those who lend money only calculate on the poor?"</p>
<p>Because Lu Hongkun's silkworms were not fed evenly, some of them began to shrink and stiffen. The nerves entangled in worry and anger obviously changed, a manic change -- Lu Hongkun beat his wife, and also cursed viciously: "What are you doing eating your fill, you ruined these silkworms, I spent one dollar and twenty cents to buy silkworm eggs, and you refuse to owe mulberry leaves at two dollars and forty cents a dan, you refuse to owe..." He cursed and then tears came out. He suddenly understood: "My wife and daughter work as hard as I do, the same pair of eyes staring at the gray autumn silkworms wriggling in the bamboo strips, the same as feeding their heart and soul and energy to the silkworms! How can I bear to beat them? Aren't they just like me, wanting to live a better life!"</p>
<p>He calmed down, looked at his wife and daughter whose eyes were crying like walnuts, and felt dizzy and swaying in front of his eyes. All the silkworm frames seemed to be about to collapse. "The price of silk has improved..." For him, this is like a sweet dream about to be warmed up, full of sourness and bloodshot dreams. "Squeak, squeak..." The slight sound of silkworms eating mulberry leaves. A gust of autumn night wind blows in from outside the window, and the kerosene lamp on the wall is almost blown out...</p>
<h3>Autumn Scenery</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>The little girls, carrying bamboo rakes (Note 1), went up the mountain.</p>
<p>Quiet and solemn air surrounded the disorganized and chaotic woods.</p>
<p>——It's autumn.</p>
<p>Yes, it's autumn again.</p>
<p>They, every autumn, go to the woods together to sweep leaves. This once-a-year event seems to be an unparalleled joy to these lively little girls.</p>
<p>——Where's Xiaoxiu?</p>
<p>A little girl wearing a purple headscarf calmly asked the girl next to her, who had two small braids.</p>
<p>——Oh, she got married.</p>
<p>——Didn't she also go up the mountain with a bamboo rake last year?</p>
<p>——Yes, she did.</p>
<p>——Time flies so fast.</p>
<p>She wiped the dust from her nose and sighed faintly. The girl with the braids said softly:</p>
<p>——But, she's often nagged (Note 2) by her husband, it's her.</p>
<p>Her pale red lips, lips dyed with autumn colors, smiled. Suddenly, she suppressed her smile, took off the purple headscarf, and said with pursed lips:</p>
<p>——Xiaoxiu is afraid of men?</p>
<p>——She's also afraid of her father-in-law and mother-in-law. Once, because she forgot to feed the chickens grain once, her mother-in-law hit her so badly that she was black and blue.</p>
<p>——Last year, last year she was "snatching thirty" (Note 3) with us?</p>
<p>They both sighed. Walking, walking quietly, the gloomy autumn sunlight of the morning, like a sick person, gently floated on their heads, floated on their hearts.</p>
<p>——Next spring, A'Xin is also getting married.</p>
<p>——Marrying a man is really unreliable! Their hearts are even harder than steel.</p>
<p>——But, aren't our grandfathers and our fathers very kind? I really don't understand: they are also men.</p>
<p>——I hope A'Xin marries a good husband!</p>
<p>——Yes, I hope so.</p>
<p>The two girls smiled shyly. A layer of red clouds floated on their faces. Why? Because they are still virgins. In the village, an unmarried woman who talks wildly about men will be "scolded" (Note 5).</p>
<p>Now they are in the valley, and the sunlight cannot fully penetrate. Could it be that the two girls' conversation will be spread by the mountain walls? So they are both at ease gossiping privately, but their untrained virgin hearts are easily shamed.</p>
<p>——What did you have for dinner at your house yesterday?</p>
<p>The girl with the purple headscarf deliberately changed the subject.</p>
<p>——Just a bowl of yellow bean sprouts.</p>
<p>——That's not bad.</p>
<p>——What about your house?</p>
<p>There are four or five little girls walking in front, they are all very sad——</p>
<p>The two girls glanced at the group of little girls walking in front. She continued to say to the girl with braids:</p>
<p>——At my house, there are only vegetables to eat, no white rice, and no 　　either.</p>
<p>——Alas.</p>
<p>——Alas, I wonder what we will do in the future?</p>
<p>Sighing, they quickened their pace, they will join the group walking in front. They are all thinking about the fun of sweeping leaves, and also thinking about using dry leaves to replace firewood when cooking at night.</p>

<p>Topic: Zhuangzi's "Free and Easy Wandering" (5)</p>
<p>It originates from the lanes and fields. It cannot be confined by righteousness and rules, nor restricted by sermons. A single chant, a single satire, the sound turns and the machine returns, slowly and leisurely, the ultimate truth is naturally encountered. It is flavorful and the five classics are all dispelled. This is because the sages wanted to use the simplicity of poetry to save the fragmentation of the Five Classics. Who knows that later generations used the difficulty of the Five Classics to change the simplicity of poetry?</p>

<p>Lu Qiuxia Double Pearl Phoenix</p>
<p>Da Lu (620) 3:45 PM to 4:30 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Little Stars of the Pu Yu Society"</p>
<p>The little stars of the Pu Yu storytelling society are all from Suzhou. Although their history is not long, they are now welcomed everywhere. Let me tell you about them one by one. Zui Yixian is like a celestial fairy, with a dignified appearance and the most civilized manners, with a generous demeanor and no vulgarity, like a lady from a boudoir. Shen Yuying is in charge of the opening, and she tells the Double Pearl Phoenix with great skill. Her art is admirable. Moreover, there is Xia Xiuzhen and Xia Xiuying, sisters who have long been known for their humorous performances. Then there are those who sing and play the Golden Phoenix and Double Gold Ingots, whose reputation has long been spread in Shanghai. Xu Qinheng and Yan Songjun, the Golden Fan Story is well-known, and the Yu tune sings out a true wonderful sound. Zhou Xueyan and He Qinfang, the innocent and lively Little Lingling, play and sing martial arts and scholarly fragrant balls, a string of pearly throats moves people's hearts. Her appearance is like Zhang Guiying. Xu Xueyue and Xu Xueren, the Three Smiles singing is the most brilliant. Xueren is like the Autumn Fragrance girl in the book, and Xueyue is good at playing the role of Zhu Yun. Zhi Yuansheng sings the Pearl Pagoda, with both sound and appearance, and his art is unparalleled. Chen Yaxian and Qian Zuixian, the two of them are called master and apprentice, with Chen as the master and Qian as the student. Playing the Japanese robe is even more brilliant. Xie Letian's White Snake is called a masterpiece, with each having the ability to tell jokes and sing. Xie Hongtian and Xie Xiaotian, not Xie family apprentices who love to fight, Zhou Guifen comments on the Green Peony, and the horse's cry is even more energetic. Tao Guoying has the aura of a female hero, and the Seven Heroes and Five Righteousnesses are famous, like Longtu reincarnated, distinguishing between good and evil. Although Wang Meiyun is young, her pearly throat is melodious and her appearance is enchanting. Zhao Meifang and Lin Juanfang, they can sing the Three Smiles and Jade Dragonfly. Mei Lingzhu and Mei Lingxian, the twin plums are called sisters. Hua Qizhen, Wang Meiying, Qiu Wanfen, and Wu Yisheng are all beautiful and captivating. Their storytelling songs each have their own abilities, but I, the junior Lu Qiuxia, reluctantly broadcast the Double Pearl Phoenix. I hope you all will forgive me, and please don't criticize my bookish voice.</p>
<p>Chen Ruilin and Chen Yunlin's Mao Family Story</p>
<p>Shi Yin (1340) 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Romantic Woman"</p>
<p>Fashionable women are surprising, how to say they are so romantic, she has graduated from high school, and her appearance is also four or five points, just because she does not know the etiquette and forgets the boudoir training, she is promiscuous and has no sense of shame, scratching and making gestures has become a habit, and applying cosmetics is her specialty, her Qing silk hair is curved, her eyes are naturally beautiful and her eyebrows are clear, she does not wear earrings which is fashionable, and her cherry lips are slightly open to reveal red gold, her qipao has short sleeves exposing her arms, and it is not known if her diamond bracelets and diamond rings are real, sometimes she does not wear stockings, and her legs are shiny and crystal clear, her natural feet are slender, and her leather shoes and high heels make a clicking sound, sometimes, she is extravagant and wants to imitate a modern woman, and sometimes her attire is like a student, she is originally cute and clever, and she is also very attentive when entertaining people, she calls "Miss" in a charming voice, and how many young people are captivated by her, she sits in a car and goes sightseeing, circling around dozens of times without stopping, she often goes to foreign parks, and it is lovely how she dances with grace, at the dog racing field and the horse racing track, she also goes to gamble and win or lose, she has a wide range of social interactions in the game field, and suddenly encounters a plague, she meets in a movie theater, and the Daron Tong Central Hotel is borrowed as a public residence, she and he are actually affectionately in love, not knowing that the heartless woman deceives the infatuated man to death, and still wants to eat swan meat and ask to get engaged, so her money is all seized by him, and it is difficult to fill the insatiable desire, the wild mandarin ducks are separated on both sides, she always says that everyone can be her husband, and the wealthy person is her lover, she spends her years happily and carefree, afraid that she will lament her drifting when she gets old, she will no longer turn back and sink into the sea of suffering, and if she gives birth to fishermen and woodcutters, she will not have a good harvest in the future.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>It is said that Xu Lai, who is praised as the "Oriental Standard Beauty," plans to go to other places because she feels that the air in Shanghai is not very good. However, her "standard husband" opposes this idea and will fight to the end.</p>
<p>Since Miss Lan Ping told her interviewers that she did not like the acting skills of Hu Die and Hu Ping, all the newspapers have recently been using this as a topic of conversation. (No, it's a crime.)</p>
<p>To be a Shanghainese, one must have "genius"; to be a movie star, one needs even more the "genius" of being a Shanghainese. Believe it, believe it. Who is Lan Ping that she dares to be so presumptuous!</p>
<p>The Xin Guang Grand Theater opened, presenting the Mingxing Company's "Big Family." Miss Hu Die was specially invited to cut the ribbon for the opening, and six female stars, including the Standard and Model, sang on stage. A huge advertisement was specially published, and the heavy traffic could be predicted. Since the summer of this year, there have been very few domestic films released. It is said that various companies are preparing to make a do-or-die effort after the new autumn, but why is the first shot, "Big Family," so generously adding gifts?</p>
<h3>Jade Achievement's Colorful Records</h3>
<p>In the tide of recession in which all kinds of businesses are withering, the Yucheng Film Company is about to make a very courageous advance, which we feel can stir up a bit of life in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>For more than a year, Yucheng Company has spent more than 100,000 yuan and made every effort to complete the sound giant film "Lady Pear Blossom," which, amidst many different kinds of praise, is about to be presented on a large scale, very soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Junta, the owner of Yucheng, felt that the location of the original photography studio on Albert Road was relatively cramped. For the sake of development needs, he has decided to rebuild a more satisfactory photography studio at a new location on West Ahems Road, which will begin construction soon. In addition to striving for a wide location for the new photography studio, all the equipment will be more complete and modern than before. All kinds of lighting equipment, radios, and cameras and their production accessories have been ordered in the United States and will arrive in Shanghai within a month.</p>
<p>After the completion of the new photography studio, three films will be produced in succession. One is "Children of the Metropolis," written and directed by Wang Junta, and the other two are written by Hong Shen and Xileng, but the titles have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>"Lady Pear Blossom" is another sensational success of a new batch of stage performers on the screen. The director is Wang Junta, and the leading actors are Wang Meiyu, Wang Xue 　, Wang Jianxin, etc., who have all had more than ten years of history on the stage.</p>
<p>There are also three old generals in the film industry performing in "Lady Pear Blossom": "Mr. Wang" Tang Jie, playing a funny song and dance troupe leader; Wang Cilong, playing a wealthy comprador; and Wang Naidong, playing a manager of a foreign firm.</p>
<p>"Lady Pear Blossom" features the three-act opera "Peach-Colored Dream," specially composed by Mr. Li Jinhui, sung by Wang Meiyu, and sung in chorus by Wang Chuangxin and child star Cui En. Wang Meiyu's singing has long been famous on stage and records, and "Peach-Colored Dream" is even more advanced.</p>
<h3>Sun Shiyi's New Work Completed</h3>
<p>In the hot summer and amidst tedious affairs, Sun Shiyi has completed his new work—"Streets and Alleys." The richness, interestingness, and profundity of the theme of this script, we can easily imagine from the name. The life of modern Chinese society is full of dramatic materials: humorous, satirical, joyful, and tragic. All the facts in progress await playwrights to collect and organize. Mr. Sun uses his deep mind and precise observation to explore the people living in various levels of this vast social circle. He writes about all kinds of people who have been forgotten, which can be called a typical realistic drama of modern China and a panoramic view of contemporary social life. Here, we can only briefly introduce a rough outline, and we will describe it in detail later.</p>
<h3>Ying Yin and Luo Jun in "Little Aunt"</h3>
<h3>Introduction to the Characters in "Golden Threaded Song"</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Grace Moore's "One Night of Love," has been seen by tens of thousands of viewers. Who can admit that she is today's extraordinary female singer? The anticipation for her second film is hotter than anything. Well, now the second film "Golden Threaded Song" will meet the audience in the shortest time.</p>
<p>Of course, this film received better reviews than "One Night of Love" when it premiered in the United States. Because it includes a very powerful story, with carefully selected actors, magnificent backgrounds, and even more human meaning, Grace Moore's singing is even better than the last time. This is due to the head of the sound department, Mr. Li Fotan, who used the latest type of sound truck to highlight the quality of Grace Moore's singing. The beauty that has never been heard before has made a further contribution in "Golden Threaded Song."</p>
<p>The female lead, Grace Moore, was chosen by the world-renowned song and dance king Zigfield as one of the ten most beautiful women in the world. The male lead, Leo Carrillo, is a very outstanding actor. It is said that when he heard the news that he was chosen to be Grace Moore's partner, he was so happy that he almost cried. Louis Alberni, who was the source of laughter in "One Night of Love," also provides a lot of laughter here.</p>
<p>This film tells the story of a four-cornered love affair. The other two male supporting actors were hired from the stage. One, Michael Bartlett, is a singer on the New York stage, and the other, Robert Allen, was also hired from New York. These two have added to the success of Grace Moore's singing.</p>
<p>The two major singing scenes are the essence selected from "La Boheme" and "Rigoletto." These are immortal classical music, and I think that people who love beauty will definitely like to appreciate them. Then, the box office problem of this film will be quite considerable.</p>
