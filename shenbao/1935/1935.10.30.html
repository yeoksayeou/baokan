<p>吾人以為英政治家欲昭大信於天下於過去之錯誤當勇敢自認不必作此掩耳盜鈴之自解日本佔頒滿洲試問是否為侵略行動國聯盟約第十條中之領土完整及政治獨立是否已為關東軍所破壞宣告日本是否為侵略國其大權在於國聯行政院而換縱行政院者又為現內閣閣員之西門君如艾登以日本之不宣而戰不構成戰爭行為則意大利之侵入阿杜華又何曾經正式之宣戰同為破約同為侵略同冒世界之不韙且日本在先意大利效顰則英國何厚於此何薄於彼艾登謂二問題在法律上意義不同乃强辭奪理未足徵信者也</p>
<p>美俄二國當時固非國聯之會員國然謂英國欲負制裁之責患美俄二國之不合作直為抹殺事實之談當時對日本侵略最表示痛恨者英美國若史汀生之表示為美國外交史上破天荒之事蘇俄為直接受日本威脅國家之一狼將入室則室中人之驅狼其舅敢必不减於其隣人也且美俄二國均為非戰公約之簽約國依史汀生對於該約之解釋亦可以援引此約而施行制裁此外更有九國公約其規定保障中國領士完整及政治獨立與國聯盟約第十條相同英美二國同負有責任太平洋之集體和平建築於華盛頓條約之上與歐洲之集體和平建築在日內瓦系統之上初無二致如英國大公無私其盡忠於集體和平自不宜因亞洲非洲而有所軒輊然則艾登所謂事實上中日問題與意阿問題有別何能自圓其說乎</p>
<p>總之英國今日對意阿問題之積極活動於國聯之威望不無少補然其動機則在本身之利益集體和平僅假借之辭其對中日問題所以冷淡對意阿問題所以負責蓋此二問題對英帝國生命綫安全之影響程度有所不同也英國今對意阿問題棘手如此實往日對中日問題不負責任所致人無遠慮必有近憂唯實主義之英國外交家亦知有所省悟否</p>

<h3>英法專家草成　意阿停戰計劃　以墨索里尼條件為藍本　尙須徵國聯與英阿同意　教皇代表和平斡旋甚力</h3>
<p>（巴黎）今日自外交部得悉、英法專家已草成意阿停戰計劃、卽將向國聯行政院及意政府分別提出、內容雖未披露、惟悉英專家曾於星期一携該草案回倫敦、向英外相霍爾請示、如贊同則提出國聯、並聞該項計劃係以墨索里尼停戰條件為根據、雖將其大半削减、然仍不免割讓許多土地也、英府政主張任何計劃、在嚴重考慮之前、必徵國聯及阿國之同意、巴黎某方面表示、此項停戰對案、如能為各方所接受、則國聯制裁行動當稍緩、以期促進鈸靜環境而利於和議、某方發言人並云、計劃內容現嚴守秘密、以免外間誤解英法在國職範圍外行動也、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）消息靈通之觀察、今日深信英國將反對意國公開或假名併吞阿國之底格勒省、據稱該省為阿王本身阿姆哈里族之區域、而意國則以為該省應為意國屬地或代管區、今日據悉、英國不擬將意相墨索里尼之和平條件通知阿王、顯已承認此種建議並無作為將來交涉基礎之價值、英國政府亦以為意國之建議不足引起改變實施制裁之考慮、惟事實上立刻妥恊雖毫無可能、然各方探詢意見之行動、據悉將繼績進行、以期和平解决東菲爭端云、（廿八日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據小巴黎人報載稱、關於以阿國南部各省卽與意屬索謀里蘭毘連地帶、劃歸意國保護之一層、國聯會人士謂其與國聯會盟約原則相牴觸、似難加以考慮、其最有可能性之解决方案、則為在該處實施委任統治、但目下最大困難、則係蒂格里省宗敎聖地阿克森城之運命問題、蓋以該城一帶、現為意軍所征服、而阿國方面則仍堅持須保全其獨立主權故也、（廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據可靠消息、羅馬敎皇現正採取審愼之外交行動、以謀儘速終止阿比西尼亞之流血戰禍、按意相墨索里尼第一次提交英法各國之建議、卽係由羅馬敎廷轉遞、敎皇之和平活動、採取兩種方式、一則向意國政府交涉、勸其與英法進行談判、二則由敎廷國務卿訓令駐英法外交代表、各向駐在國政府示意、請其勿將意國建議堅决拒絕、而另行設法調解、以使意國建議與國聯會行政院五國委員會之建議互相融洽、一般人相信敎廷此項交涉、係於最近與英法兩國所作和平談判同時提出云、（廿八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英外相霍爾因十月三十一日開始之國聯制裁調整委員會會議將作重要之决議、故决親自出馬、參與會議、茲定星期四晨起程赴日內瓦、大約將留駐至十一月三日、惟此舉並非表示英政府政策將有何變動、不管部閣員艾登則定星期三日起程赴日內瓦、俾得參與調整委員會第一日會議、將留駐至會議終止時止、調整委員會上星期延會時、曾請各會員國儘十月二十八日以實行對意制裁所取或擬取之計畫通知國聯秘書處、各國政府之覆文將在調整委員會重行集議之前送到、故該委員會主要之任務、今將為决定共同實施禁止意貨輸入建議之日期、</p>
<p>上星期二日央外相霍爾在下院所發之演說中、曾謂今將利用實施此項建議以前之時間、探討能否覓取適合國聯盟約精神並可由意阿兩國接受之調解辦法、厥後羅馬與巴黎間曾進行外交上之交換意見、一般人士初盼此種努力或可成立調解之基礎、今此希望漸歸消亡、事幾可豫决者、國聯中之列强今除實施制裁調整委員會所草定之計畫全部程序以期縮短意阿戰爭之時期早日吿成和議外、別無他道、故英外相之决議親赴日內瓦、非因英政府之意見有何變更、實因重視國聯之行動故也、（廿九日路透電）</p>

<p>（東京）國聯曾於本月二十二日以制裁委員會議長之名義、關於國聯對意採取制裁之態度、向日本政府發出通牒、以探聽日本政府之態度、但日本政府對國聯非僅無政治上協助之義務、且對意之關係自與國聯會員國有所不同、故關於表明態度、亦須愼重審議、茲悉外務當局於二十九日表明其態度如左、國聯從來對於日本政府行使此種形式之通告、固屬事實、依照先例、故對此次巴議長之通吿、决定不給與任何答覆、而採取靜默之態度云、（廿九日日聯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）制裁方案調整委員會所通過之各項决議案、（卽關於禁止軍火運往意國、對意實施財政經濟制裁曁參加制裁各國在經濟上互助之决議案）曾經國聯會秘書廳錄送各會員國、限於二十九日以前答復、此項限期業於今晚屆滿、截至今日為止、有三十九國業已實行禁運軍火、二十一國實行財政制裁、十一國謂已準備實行經濟制裁、六國已準備實行經濟互助、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）丹麥京城丹麥政府準備實施國聯大會制裁委員會所提出之各項建議案、但其中若干種措置、事前須經國會通過、國會現定十日內開會、當可有所决定、政府希望制裁方案、在十一月十五日左右可見諸實施、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>阿根廷京城　據本社訪員所知、意大利商業代表團、已與阿根廷當局開始談判、訂立商約事宜、惟消息靈通人士則以為阿根廷政府現方考慮實施對意制裁之辦法、故商約未必能卽行成立、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>意國應付制裁　傾向反資本主義　各種原料品改歸國營　現金準備目前尙充足</h3>
<p>（羅馬）國聯會對于經濟制裁、不日卽將規定實施日期、其結果所至、殆將使法西斯主義、傾向反資本主義之途徑、觀于意大利政府近頃對于煤·銅·錫鎳及引擎發揮油等物品、先後實施國營制度、卽可見之、目下意國對于各種原料品已實行一種「獨裁制度」、不久且將頒佈大批命令、對于目前尚可自由經營之各種經濟活動、亦復加以節制、使其成為國營化、至于財政制裁、在實際上早已見諸實施、自八月份下半月以來、英國甚至美國之大部份商家、對于意國業已取消賒帳辦法、若干外國出口商、對于意國進口商之貨欵、僅許以短期通融、甚且有以二十四小時為付欵限期者、換言之、卽等於以現欽購貨、但意國現金準備額截至目下為止、尚在四十萬萬里拉以上、是以財界人士以為意國對于制裁、當不難應付云、（廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）政府下令任何人士離開意國時、當向官廳呈報所携意幣之數額、此數至多不得超過二千里拉、又任何人士重返意國者、所携欵項不得較離境時所呈報之數為多、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英國選舉運動昨已積極開始、工黨新領袖艾特里。樞密大臣麥唐納·閣員艾登·衛生大臣伍德·及印度事務大臣塞特蘭侯爵皆有演詞發表、英相包爾溫昨在華孚漢墩開始其選舉運動、言及將來對意制裁採用封鎖行動之危險、謂苟不得美德日三國之同情的援助、渠决不贊成英國有封鎖行動、在過去二三月內、和平不復為玄談的問題、而已成男女老幼個人之實物、今世界所遇之困難、無非為國際爭議究應以武力解决之乎、抑可如私人爭執用法律解决之乎、對此問題、僅可有一個答語、英國人民不能置身於離世界而孤立之狀况中以解决此重大事件也、合作以謀和平之努力並非虛夢、亦非荒謬的武俠、但為堅實的常識云、英相繼言及修治軍備以補國防罅隙之必要、謂以言軍備、英國未有極力擴大軍備之問題、吾人所欲者、不過以新艦換補戰前所建之軍艦耳、如英島離衆孤立、不與聞世界事、則英國勢必成武裝軍營、國聯發起者深知國聯如無人輔助、則戰事將不能使之局部化、而制止兩國間戰爭之計畫將不能實行、其結果將為世界大戰云、包爾溫後言及國內礦業爭執、謂政府希望於數日內獲有礦主方面之特殊擔任、於明年七月一日以前設立企業運銷機關云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）樞密大臣麥唐納以前在歐戰時代、曾堅持和平主張，今日宣布、彼亦贊同首相鮑爾溫之政策、主張增加英國海陸軍備、此項聲明係麥氏今日在喀克斯登大禮堂演說時所發表、彼曾表示意國此次攻阿、已使彼相信欲維持和平條約、必須以武力為之後盾，「英國若防衛不週、則在目前世界進化之時期中、非特不足有裨和平、抑且可以成為戰爭之導源、吾人在日內瓦勞心焦思、而成立之安全條約、如被一二侵略國之行動卽遭摧殘、則惟有回復至往時合縱連橫競爭軍備之日終於釀成戰爭而已」云云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）不管部閣員艾登昨夜在某處演說、謂英國贊助國聯之計畫、其堅决與偉大、為前所未有、此蓋由一般人士深信唯藉國聯始能希望造成世界之新秩序、職是之故、今無一國圖用武力為其國家政策之工具者、說者謂英國於此次意阿爭議在國聯中之行動、失之過緩、為此言者、實昧於眞相、國聯在過去數星期中之行動、堪稱眞正固結之團體、而深明國際之責任、彼等如一念及國聯工作之若何棘手、則必盛讚國聯之生氣勃勃矣、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>工黨艾特里在其廣播詞中、謂目前總選舉中之兩個真正問題。為免除戰爭之安全、與生活方法之安全、工黨確信世界必須解除軍備、而聯成一種集體安全制度、政府擁護國聯之殷勤、係完全新有的、彼等從未一心維護國聯、但始終瞻顧於戰前帝國主義與聯盟的政策之後、戰禍起於經濟制度、今必須有經濟之合作、以科學之發明為世界人民福云、阿特里言及內政、謂政府採行痴狂者之經濟學說、擬提高物價而不利於本國、須知吾人現生活於新世界中、必須適應吾人在此之特殊情形、今日工商業之機構至為繁複、决不可委諸私人事業、而聽其唯利是求、吾人必須慘淡經營、以造成吾人所欲有之不列顛、工黨如獲機會、將立即著手於還大計畫、惟目前難題亦當處理云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）獨立工黨（為極端左翼團體、與國會中之工黨不同、）今日發表宣言、指摘英國政府、稱之為在地中海準備戰爭、「以保護帝國利益」、並對於國會工黨贊成對意制裁、亦肆意批評、（二十八日國民社電）</p>

<p>開羅　據本社訪員探悉、埃及政府頃採取適當措置、預防外交情勢緊張時、所可發生之意外事端、昨日為意國法西斯黨進軍羅馬紀念日、故當局戒備尤為周密、內務部并已着手調査意國僑民之職業住址、同時意國駐開羅領事館、則禁止該國僑民、舉行足以擾亂和平秩序之一切公開示威運動、又裝載意國軍隊軍械前往意屬伊利特里亞之船舶寄碇開羅時、埃及政府均徵收碼頭費、比經意國政府重行要求豁免、茲據消息靈通人士表示、埃及政府對於此種要求、仍將加以拒絕云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿國軍事領袖頃在穆薩亞里區域防地舉行會議、一般人預料戰率將在該區域附近發生、又聞蓋達舒將軍擬率勁旅百萬、在十一月初間開始向意軍陣地總攻擊、因此蓋達舒將軍頃已自台西城軍次前赴穆薩里亞、以便指揮全境軍事、蓋達舒將軍頃說明其所採取之特殊戰略、謂「阿國士兵四名應共用步槍一枝、一人戰死卽第由二人執槍迎戰、第二人陣亡則第三第四人繼之」又謂「如敵人一日在阿國境內、則一日無和平解决之可言、在兩個月之後、余不信尚有意兵一名能在阿國境內立足」云、此外一般人相信阿國皇儲現在台西城率部抗敵、表示寗願在前綫指揮作戰、雖奉阿皇之召亦不願郎返京城云、（二十九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>蒂格里省前綫　意軍頃由安底西奧陣綫出動、其目的在保護意軍左翼之安寗、同時並以鞏固右翼之陣營、一般人相信在最近將來、一俟陣綫佈置完竣、輕電隊伍集中最前綫、前綫與後方道路建築吿成軍需可以自由運輸時、意軍卽將完全採取殖民戰爭之戰略、則以此種戰略、有較大之發動力故也、又聞安底西奧區域土着數百分、紛紛向意軍投效、願擔任築路或軍事工作、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>前「滿國」政府重復採取彼種不能使問題獲得友誼解决、並令兩國邦交發生不必要之變化之最後方法從事談判、蒙古政府對此、殊表遺憾、滿方以最後通牒形式、要求蒙方接受其分派代表前往三處（庫倫在內）之提議、對於蒙方恰合談判宗旨之建議、則拒絕考慮、此種熊度不得不令蒙古政府驚異、蒙方關於調解邊境糾紛、建議一種辦法、在滿洲里及塔姆蘇美分設初級委員會各一所、其中一所負責處理自滿蒙邊界極北部至加魯倫河一段之糾紛事件、由蒙古駐滿洲里代表一人及滿當局相當代表一人組織之、此外一所由滿方駐塔姆蘇美代表一人及蒙方相當代表一人組織之、其任務在處理滿蒙邊界其他部份所發生之事件、此二初步委員會將有充分機會、對於滿蒙邊界一切問題、及時並就地解决、照蒙方建議、如邊境糾紛初步委員會亦不能解决時、則提交邊境混合委員會處理之、混合委員會由雙方代表組成、其任務在遵照各該政府命令、對各項問題作最後解决、由此觀之、蒙方建議適與兩國政府舉行談判之任務相合、且能以簡單適宜之方式、對於邊境糾紛作迅速而友誼之解决、蒙古政府以為舉凡有充分權力之人物、如有正式權力、必能迅速解决此等問題、且應委充代表、蒙古政府認為滿方建議代表應駐海拉爾及貝恩吐門一點、並無充分理由、因蒙方所提辦法、各段邊界糾紛已能由塔姆蘇美及滿洲里初步委員會予以解决、至於所稱庫倫及長春應設更經常之機關、此點更少理由、因上述兩地距離邊境甚遠、其於邊界糾紛决不直接解决也、</p>
<p>蒙方說帖末稱、蒙古政府希望滿方於提出問題時、能放棄其非就事論事之態度、並能對於蒙方建議在事實上之便利、作正確之估量、滿代表團如能以就事論事之態度、提出其論點與希望、以期成立得為雙方接受之協定、眞能保證滿蒙邊界之和平與安靜者、則蒙古政府必能鄭重考慮一如往昔」云、（二十八日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>「忍耐」是可以的，但不要走「屈服」的路。</p>
<p>在現代—二十世紀動盪的今天，我們果然不能像「睡面自乾」式的忍耐，但是我們也更不能偈學耶穌的被打了右頰，索性連左頰也送上去打，因為這種都不是忍耐，這種是極度懦弱的表示，也就是十二分屈服的行為。</p>
<p>「忍耐」是要有相當的限度的，它是有時間性和空間性的，換句話說：就是忍耐決不是一種消極的侵襲，更深地認清，加以暫時的忍耐，但千萬不要因了忍耐，而就消蝕了你固有的毅力</p>
<h3>歧途的終點</h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>這一天，第某號牢房加入了一個衣服麗都而面容憔悴的靑年進來，因為他的態度不像是凶惡的賊徒，是以全房里的囚徒們，都投給他一道驚奇的眼光，好像歡迎這一個細皮白肉的新同志。這靑年拖着學生的腳鐐，換了囚衣，面部的表情是萬變的，忽而羞愧，忽而警惶，忽而嗔恨，最後頹然坐了下來。</p>
<p>這牢房是不大光亮的，而空氣也有點異味，這使他十分難過，然而一想到他得在這裏住上兩個年頭時，他便只好隨遇而安了。這時有一個年紀較老些的囚友過來招呼他：</p>
<p>「喂！兄弟，你是犯了什麼條文給送進來的？你不像我們這一路的人呀！可以吿訴我們聽聽嗎？」</p>
<p>那靑年給這一問，眼淚竟奪眶而出，哽咽着說道：</p>
<p>「唉！是我不好，我是走了歧路了。活該的，活該的！我先前在某某銀行管賬，生活十分適意的。偶然跟了幾個朋友玩窰子，認識了一個美貌的姐兒，此後我便給弄迷了，一天不去會伊，便不好過，有限的金錢不能博伊的歡心，伊是有名氣的妓女，我眞是太昏迷了，上個月我偷拿了行里一萬三千多塊錢，就匿跡在伊的院裏，快活了不過八天工夫，就給人家查了出來，欵子用掉幾百塊餘下來的一萬二千多塊錢追還了銀行，我就判了兩年的徒刑，這就是我到此地來的緣故了，是我不好，活該的，只可憐家裏的老母，伊不知怎樣傷心呢…」</p>
<p>大家都默然了。</p>
<h3>女響導員</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>前天咱到朋友所組織的俱樂部談天，大家很嫌寂寞。朋友道：最近有人辦一種事業，很可以應寂寞的人的需要，咱們來試一回吧說着，他便起來打電話。</p>
<p>沒多時候，咱們俱樂部裏，忽左忽右來了一位健美的女人，笑迷迷一屁股坐了下來，問咱們道：諸位喜歡旅行嗎？購物嗎？遊覽嗎？遊覽名勝嗎？嚮導什麼事情，都請賜教。伊老練端重，把一口本地言語，跟咱們談話，一些兒沒有羞澀輕薄的態度。</p>
<p>咱們旣不欲遊覽，又不要購物，因為好奇心動，只得把不三不四的事情，跟伊來談。方纔曉得伊們嚮導社員所負的使命，是：（一）初到上海的人，人地生疏，伊們能夠伴同遊覽。（二）路過上海的中外人士，要觀光一下，不得不請老上海嚮導，伊們便是負這使命的人。（三）上海是東亞大埠，名勝古蹟很多，伊們也可以伴客人做嚮導。哦！咱明白了，伊們原來個個是識途的老馬。</p>
<p>咱想，咱們久住都市的人，對於都市的輪廓，大槪都略知梗槪，無須請教高明。只是都市的黑暗層，委實不大明瞭，這非請教識途的老馬不可，不知道伊們肯嚮導嗎？</p>
<p>咱們要保護生命財產，有法律顧問；要白相，有女嚮導員；上海人做人眞開心哩。</p>
<h3>南湖曲</h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>水風泛樹正蕭蕭，如此恬湖有暮潮！白髪阿娘憐作力，還須載客遞湖橋。儂家柔櫓即黃金，湖上蘆花寒作衾，三十六灣都泊遍，說來誰要客開心？南湖水產十分賤，剝與老餐指不勝；看慣菱花開復謝，可憐無福吃靑菱！泊船最怕樹聲多，蓋了鳥蓬掛子簑；永夜清寒波影白，阿儂姊妹是嫦娥！</p>
<h3>懺悔庵</h3>
<p>不要蒲團玉磬參，老尼活計在秋蠶；無端閔破蓮燈影，一握靑絲艷小庵。</p>
<h3>煙雨樓中秋遇雨</h3>
<p>欹樓頹墖分明峙，木舫蘆蓬侷促浮，疲腳聽天驚半世！涼湖　燭過中秋；齒牙垂惜紅蝦老，肺腑豈堪白露流？多謝瞑煙收月廓，清光饒上腐儒頭！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十回　掙命看嬌孫抱頭落淚荒年億往事種麥招殃</p>
<p>月英道：後來他就把我爹帶到軍隊裏去了，堡子裏，另外遠有一個種麥種多些的人，也是讓他帶了去了，我奶奶，我娘，我，看到把人帶了去了，都在後面跟着。那些大兵先是拿了槍把子欄着我們，不讓我們去。後來那軍官說，讓我們去看看也好，就讓我們去了。堡子裏人不放心，也都跟了去。不想他們把人帶了去，話也不多問一句，不把我爹和堡子裏同去的那個人一齊拷吊起來？周太太道：怎麼叫拷吊？月英道：就是把人兩手兩腳，一齊綁了起來，吊在屋梁上。周太太道，自然人是懸空的了，那怎樣受得了？月英道：那還是好的呢，平常拷吊，還是要用皮鞭子抽的。周太太道：你旣是知道這麼一件事，甘肅地方，常拿皮鞭子抽人嗎？月英道：縣老爺催欵，就常常拷吊的。周太太道：那麼，你們也就把拷吊這種刑罰，不當一回事了。月英苦楚。別人看着罷了，我們親骨肉，看到這樣吊起來，魂都嚇飛了，只有跪在地上，求那軍官開恩。他們眞是鐵打心肋，把我爹吊起來以後，只把四個兵守了那空屋子，我們跪着哀求，他不聽到，也不看見。偏偏他們吊拷我爹的那間屋子，倒了兩面墻，我們在外面，也是看得很清楚的。我爹兩手兩腳都吊在背後臉朝了下。掛東西一樣，掛在梁上。我爹先是熬不作聲，後來就喊大老爺開恩救命，再到後來，連開恩救命也喊不出來，臉上由紅變到灰白，只管是哼！我們一家人，還有那個堡同子的人一家，都跪在屋外院子裏，一齊哭着。（三五二）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我那裡正站在太后的近身，很清楚地瞧見伊聽了李蓮英的話，雙肩便突然一聳，差不多就要把身體從座上跳起來的樣子，我不由也連帶吃了一驚；因為我雖然知道深秋不是應開玉蘭花的季節，但我卻不懂得什麼是祥兆，什麼是凶兆，所以太后那樣的大受震驚，直使我有些莫名其妙。於是我就屏聲悉氣地用心聽着。</p>
<p>「怎樣？那些玉蘭樹莧又開起花來了嗎」？太后透着一種不常有的慌亂之態問道：「快把詳細的情形說將出來咧！如今給我快說！快說！」</p>
<p>「回太后！奴才怎敢不說實話！委實全是眞的！方才有一個園丁來說，那裏確有一朵玉蘭花已經開放了……」。</p>
<p>「只是一朵嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的！老佛爺！據說那是這園內的一顆最老的玉蘭樹，今兒已有一朵極完整的鮮花盛放着了。這眞是互古希逢的奇事，可不必再用媽才饒舌，誰也能知道是大吉大利的祥瑞了！」</p>
<p>李蓮英儘是滿口的嚷着「吉利」，「祥瑞」，可是我們太后卻已早就驚呆了；伊的臉色霎時便變成灰白，心裏似乎想說什麼話，卻祇見伊的嘴唇在那裏不住的張合，半響聽見有什麼聲音發出來。在這四五分鐘的時間內，伊的年齡竟像寒暑表一般的突然增加了十來歲光景。我們還可以很清楚地看見伊那按在前胸上的一支手的五個指頭因受驚過度而在索索地抖著；可是我們那一班侍候伊的人除掉李蓮英以外，誰都不明白是什麼緣故，更不知道應該如何給伊勸解，便祇能讓伊一個獨自默默地憂慮着自己理想中的快要監頭的大禍了。（四四八）</p>
<h3>「大自鳴鍾」沒有鍾</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>「大自鳴鍾」，是在上海法租界，介乎「鄭家木橋」與「吉祥街」之間的一個電車站名。只要到過上海的人，誰都知道。</p>
<p>至於為什麼叫該處為「大自鳴鍾？那我想，注意的人是很少。據我知道，因為該處是法租界的中央巡捕房所在地，該巡捕房的上面，就是裝有一隻「大自鳴鍾」，所以該處，便以「大自嗚鍾」為名了。</p>
<p>但是，如今該處中央巡捕房，已經翻造為九層樓大廈，上面是沒有鍾的。而該處卻依然叫做「大自嗚鍾」。我想，將來年深月久之後，也許要和「偷雞橋」，「八仙橋」，「東新橋」，「西新橋」，「鄭家木橋」等一樣，名不副實，叫人莫明其妙！因記之，以備日後參考。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>談蟹</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>在這時三秋乍臨，西風將起，清霜初下，楓葉漸紅，正是湖蟹肥滿的時候，持螯賞菊，剝殼剔黃，老餐已食指大動。市上的蟹攤。也日風茂盛了。蟹是一種水族，味美回腴，一年四季，都有生產，但是在春季的蟹，尚沒有長滿，旣小而空，夏季雖較肥滿，開關為小，都不十分可口，必須到了桑葉黃落，西風吹起的秋深，方肥大而滿，黃油均足，味亦鮮腴了。冬季則湖水成凍，出產已少，所以吃蟹，正是現在深秋初冬，最是當令。</p>
<p>蟹有沙蟹和清水蟹的分別，沙蟹產於江水　水沙內。味略帶鹹，不知清水蟹遠甚，清水蟹產於淡水之中，味甜腴鮮美，是蟹的種類中最妙的一種。在江南地方，出產很多，正儀的洋澄湖，最是有名，因洋澄湖的水，清可見底，出產的蟹，眞是清水甜蟹，滋味比了別處所出產的，高妙多多。而且洋澄蟹有一種特點，生得靑背，白肚，金爪，紅毛，所以呌做金爪洋澄。除了洋澄蟹之外，周荘等地的蟹，也是清水蟹的一類，雖較次於洋澄，在蟹的出品中，也是著名的一處。沙蟹在沿長江一帶的地方，出產得很多，比了洋澄湖蟹，卻差得多了。</p>
<p>現在市上所見的蟹，最大的不過碗大，以前相傳，蟹最大的，長至九尺，且有白足，謂之百尺蟹，見於「洞冥記」上，漢武帝時，春苑國貢一蟹，長九尺，百中螯，　名百尺蟹。還有一蟹可載一車，比了百尺蟹也差相仿佛的偉大了。「汲家圖書一載，海陽大蟹」，是在清水之陽，一蟹專車，其大可想而知了。</p>
<p>蟹是一個總名稱，雌的俗稱團臍，又叫博帶。雄的尖臍，稱為浪　。是「廣雅所載，解跪也，雄曰浪　，雌曰博帶。據「呂亢蟹圖記」談，蟹的各類，共有十二種之多，亢命工　蟹圖，凡十有二種，一曰蝤蚌」，二曰「撥棹子」，三曰「擁劍」，四曰「嘭蝟」，五曰「竭朴」，六曰「沙狗」，七曰「望潮」，八曰「倚望」，九曰「石焑」，十曰「蜂江」，十一曰「蘆虎」，十二曰「嘭蜞」。這十二個蟹名，只有第十二個「蟛蜞」，卻是現在所有，其餘都沒有聽見過了。</p>
<p>關於蟹的神怪事情，以前也有不少，最怪的是能驅瘡鬼，出在「夢溪筆談」，關中無螃蟹，偶收得一蟹，怖其狀，以為怪物，人有病瘡者，則借去縣門戶，往往遂瘥，不但人不識，鬼亦不識也。這眞是聞所未聞的怪事，不過這種神話，在以前有人信以為眞，因以前的瘡病，常認為有瘡鬼作崇，到了現在，科學昌明，都知道瘡疾是一種微菌作用，無所謂有鬼，蟹能治瘡，誰都不能信任了。</p>
<p>蟹雖是一種美味，人都歡喜吃，但是性子極寒，蟹殻又發燥，多吃沒有益處，所以煮蟹的時候，常以紫蘇和生病蓋同煮，便是解除蟹的寒氣。蟹同柿子同食，可以制命，俗稱蟹爬腸，實則柿子同蟹，都是極寒，同時吃下，自然足以致病，並不是眞的蟹在肚內，會活潑爬起肚腸來啊！</p>

<p>南恩還沒功夫想到什麼的飾詞小梅卻已將全個故事傾筐倒篋說了出來，急得太腓入地無門，祗可將臉兒藏過在放牛奶和麵包的碗裏。等到故事完畢以後，裴先生的眼睛直看到長桌子盡頭他夫人的所在，眼　裏充滿了笑容說道：</p>
<p>「親愛的，這件事是關於你那一部分的，所以我不願去干涉它。」</p>
<p>蜀夫人知道他的意思，可是她如今更愛她的小黑羊，因為她有這般勇氣，不過她外表上卻只放着最莊嚴的神氣說道：</p>

<h3>談吃素</h3>
<p>— 姚慕</p>
<p>隨着佛法之大走紅運，吃素的風氣也盛極一時，由不識不知的村姑老嫗，到坐朝當道的大人先生，旣皈依空王，自然也就吃素。素食館已成為此間的一種投機買賣，像雨後的葷子那樣在不景氣的市面茁生出來。</p>
<p>不消說，在優婆夷優婆塞看來，吃素就是不殺生，不殺生就是功德。其實中國四萬萬人中修此功德的，說少一點，也有二萬萬，鄉下人差不多全是「自然的」素食者：咬草根樹皮的苦行家固是一天多似一天，一般的農人試問有幾個能够一年中有三兩頓肉吃，他們當作自己性命一般看待的鷄和猪還不是養來飽他人的口腹麼？所以「何不食肉糜」一句話在豐年的時候也還是一風凉」。</p>
<p>不過大人先生們吃厭了魚翅燕窩塡到腸肥腦滿之後，吃吃豆腐，參參「玉版禪」，絢爛之極，歸於平淡，倒還不俗，而且也是養生一法。</p>
<p>我與佛沒有緣，然也有時喜歡吃素，我的親戚朋友中吃素的更有不少。十二三歲的時候，由於兩個吃素的表姊，我開始知道素食的風味，大表姊是沒有兒女的窮寡婦，守寡和吃素當然很容易聯在一塊，二表姊是一個近三十歲的老閨女，因為害了一塲大病，父母們便在菩薩面前計下帶髮修行的願，她們那時常在我們家裏住夜，跟母親和姊姊作伴。她們燒得一手好素菜，碰着節日生日，她們便親自下廚燒給我們吃。甚麼素鴨子，素火腿，做得又像又好吃。大表姊是在印子錢的壓榨和妯娌們的欺凌之下過日子的。背着人彈淚歎氣，跟生人多說幾句話也臉孔通紅。二表姊伶俐善伺人意，但有點小心眼，常像是有滿胸的抑鬱似的。但是她們都很喜歡我和我的妹妹，一家人中也只有我們姊妹兩人能逗她們笑，那時我們的家庭正在</p>
<p>一種不幸的境遇中，她們的殷勤，體貼使多病善愁的母親得不少的慰藉，而我們也因此添了兩個長姊和保姆似的伴侶，她們的家離我們不遠，我們姊妹兩個，一到日落吃過飯的時俊，便去接她們來。常因為她們推辭而賠眼淚，到她們答應了才破涕為笑。當我們渡過小石橋沿着小河，帶着新月，拂過花枝掩映的廢園，回到家裏的時候，我們的幼雅的心靈滿着勝利的歡悅。我們連忙在院中揀幾朶開在黃昏裏的茉莉花摘下，硬給她們戴上，表示我們的謝忱。她們陪母親說過話之後便在院子裏給我們講故事打謎兒。一天不見她們便感到難耐的寂寞。眞的，親戚中給我們的童年以最深刻的印象的，只有她們吧。</p>
<p>轉眼又過了十多年了，親戚朋友中學佛茹素的漸多起來，但是我入中學那年，二表姊就謝世，害的是女人慣患的肺癆病。大表姊呢，我不見她也已有好幾年了，聽說她還殘存着，縱然常嘔出一痰盂一痰盂的血，蒼老憔悴像老婦人那樣，還是要借新債還舊債，仗着十指半飢半飽來過着寡婦的暮年。她們悲慘的遭遇縱然不是吃素的結果，但說起吃素，我總不能不想姐們的悲慘的遭遇來。</p>
<p>在歐洲的一大部分女人也差不多可以說是素食者。她們不愛吃肉，不是因為信佛，也不是因為窮，而是恐怕吃肉會胖壞她們的苗條的身材。不過真正的素食者Vegetarian也是所在多有，愛護動物的道德觀念，或衛生的科學思想構成他們的動機。素食館在大城市裏頭總有好幾間。在德國我也曾嘗試過：素菜的價錢比葷菜還貴，味道沒有中國的那樣好；但紅白相間的　蔔絲，菊花樣的金筍，碧綠的生菜做成的冷盤Salad，鏤切特別精巧，顏色特別鮮妍，倒像一件美術品，使人不忍夾到嘴裏去。</p>
<p>歐洲有一個以Nelson（德國近世哲學家）的道德哲學為基礎的修道院式的社會主義團體，吃素和和平一樣是牠的主要信條。我們常來往的朋友中有一位Ａ女士就是屬於這個團體。我們有時聚在一塊兒做的中國飯，大杯酒大塊肉吃的當兒，她便自己燒一點西紅柿或鷄蛋另吃，我們覺得她未免有點殺風景，熱烈的辯論常會燃起來。她把吃素的微言大義鄭重地說出，有兩三個好嚼舌根的男朋友故意持着反對之論，把應有盡有的論點拿出來：甲從哲學生物學方面證明植物動物之平等齊觀，乙詭辯地說，素食者無論怎樣戒殺，一天內總要吞下恒河沙數的微生蟲，丙更從社會學說明肉食是人類進化的一個重要的關鍵，但是，任由我們說得天花亂墜，好辯的Ａ女士還是堅持她的理由，有時急起來，紅着臉說。、</p>
<p>「你們强詞奪理，我不跟你們辯了。」</p>
<p>我將回國的時候，Ａ女士特別從外城跑到柏林來看我們，為盡主人之誼，我們全吃素，而且親自下廚弄菜。有一回我要做一個辣炒白菜絲，為着省力，用一個齒形的刨來擦絲，怎知刨太快了，一不小心便把手指頭割破，去了一塊皮肉，流了好幾滴的血。同下廚的Ｂ君笑我沒有用，接着就擦，怎知一動手也照樣賠了一些血肉。我們雖把白菜絲仔細的洗過，但相信總有我們的一些血肉參在裏頭。</p>
<p>「吃素這回變做吃人肉了！」Ｂ君吃吃的笑起來。</p>
<p>這個社會主義團體，還在離柏林不遠的鄉下下辦有一個家庭似的小學校，食宿都在校裏。Ｂ君的法國朋友有一個六歲女兒，也放在那裏念書。希特勒上台以後，這個團體和附設的學校都成為非法而遭解散了。Ｂ君受了朋友之託把她的女孩帶到巴黎去，在B君的家裏，我會見了這個女孩。她雖然像別的小孩那樣見了可可糖洋點心就眼開，但是苦勸她一片火腿，她死篇素食的大道理來。她的論調，我們都已從Ａ女士領敎過，大致沒有差別，後來跟我們混熟一點，連別人吃肉也會引出她一篇小Sermon（說教）來。</p>
<p>「討厭的素食說敎者呵！」聽得不耐煩的Ｂ君帶笑的說。</p>
<p>現在這班朋友已各散東西了，Ａ女士更不知那兒去，說起吃素，我不禁苦憶起他們來。</p>
<h3>交誼史話二</h3>
<p>— 另境</p>
<p>世傳管鮑為尚信義的標準朋友，其實未必確當。照史記的管仲列傳上所記，則管仲實充分表示為一個徒知利己的小人，鮑叔牙却纔是一個「够朋友」的信義之人。大致交誼之閒，單講一「信」字比較容易，要兼能盡「義」則就頗非易易了。中國人素重家族觀念，尤其是親子關係特別看的嚴重，所以五倫中父子倫排在第二倫，牠僅比君臣倫低一級，然朋友倫却排在末位，比兄弟夫妻都不重要得多了。禮記上說：「父母存，不許友以死。」因親在而以身許人，是有忘親之心，故若父母尚存，為子者是不能為其友報警的。可見在中國要想達到朋友間的「義」字是不很容易的，不過話雖如此說，若謂人人都能從聖人之訓却也未必然，二十四史裏儘可找出許多重義的例子來的，三國志吳志吳範傳云：</p>
<p>「範素與魏滕同邑相善。滕嘗有罪，權責怒茶嚴，敢有諫者死。範謂滕曰：「與汝偕死！」曰；「死而無益，何用死為？」範曰：「安能慮此，坐觀汝邪？」乃髡頭自溥詣門下，使鈴下以聞，鈴下不敢曰：「必死，不敢白。」範曰：「汝有子邪？」曰：「有。」曰；「使汝為吳範死，子以屬我。」</p>
<p>鈴下曰：「諾。」乃排闔入，言未卒，權大怒，欲便投以戟，梭巡走出，範因突入，叩頭流血，言與涕並，良久權意釋，乃免滕。滕見範謝曰：「父母能生長我，不能免我於死，丈夫相知，如汝足矣，何用多為」</p>
<p>吳範之救魏滕完全為朋友之『義』，故使魏滕感動到說出頗有「叛逆」的話來，設周公孔子而處魏滕當日的境地，怕也會推翻他們自己認為大經地義的訓話了。不過我們對於「義」之一字，不能完全是盲目的利用，似江湖帮口的那種義法，這種「都兇式」的義是不足為我輩取法的，我們應在私情之外加上一種是非之見。如吳範之捨身救魏滕，乃是因為魏賸確是一個秉性剛直，行不苟合的君子，要是魏滕是一個貪權誤國的卑劣小人，那麼吳範的道種行動怕就不會得人諒解，留史靑册了。做一僩人的重要處，就在是非之見這個關口，能够把握得住這個關口，至少他可算已經做了一半人了，若冉進而「捨身取義」，自然就成為大勇者無疑，吳範是一個，宋朝王回的行事更來得瀟洒，宋史鄒浩傳云：</p>
<p>「王回字景深，仙遊人，與鄒浩友善。皇后劉氏立，浩將論之，密吿回，回曰：「事寗有大於此者乎？子雖有親，然移孝為忠，亦太夫人素志也。」浩南遷，　莫　顧。回歛交遊錢與治裝，往來經理，目慰安其母，邏者以聞，逮詣詔獄，衆為之懼，回居之晏然。御史詰之，對曰：「實嘗預議，不敢欺也，』因誦浩所上章幾二千言。獄上，陳名停廢，即徒步出都門，行數十里，其子追及，問以家事，又答。……」</p>
<p>像王回的行事，雖然他的出發點還是一個「義」字，但究竟不免太洒脫了一點，因為即使不承認與謀，也未見得就與鄒浩有碍，承認了也仍不能减脫鄒浩的罪名。不過人各有性，不能强人所難，他的那種古道之風，在這浮滑卑屈之今日，也頗足耐人反省呢。明陶宗儀的輟耕錄裏載着一個故事，雖也近乎義舉，但和上述二人的熊度並不相同，却有點「跡近招搖」了：</p>
<p>「杭州屬邑，有一巨室，怗財挾勢，虐害良善，邑官貪墨，莫敢誰何，衆不可堪，走訴憲府，巨室逃匿，憲使怒，督責有司，示罪賞，揭大逵，且家至壁白：隱藏者，罪連坐首？捕者賞萬緡。其友人王一業者，世業儒，居湖山第一樓，藏彼於密，期月不發，隣家察知，圖洽賞錢，吿報於官，官搜索得之，併王逮繫囚，見憲使，使問云：「女知彼所犯乎？」王曰：「知之」。「女聞國有制乎？」曰：「知之。」「女見揭示罪賞乎？」曰：「見之。」「女奚不就利避害乎？」曰：一朋友顚連來奔，乘其危以售之，則名敎中所不容，某誠弗忍為，事覺連坐，乃甘心焉。」使竦然曰：「君子所謂臨難毋苟免，其人踐之　，眞義士也，芳加以罪，是吾政苛而刑濫，民何以勸？」遂釋之。……」</p>
<p>陶字儀和這位憲使都節賞王一山的義士之德，也許就因為土一山是一個帶着方巾的儒家，其實都不免上了這位方巾先生的當了，安知他的藏匿巨室不是為日後「靠福」之謀呢？僅憑其幾句腐儒的口頭禪，使其逍遙法外，更滿載「義士」之　，我想這位憲使也不免是一位沽名釣譽之徒血已。笑禪錄裏有一個故事：「舉一佾問雪峰，乞師指示佛法，蜂云：「是甚麼說，甲乙兩友，平素極厚，一日，甲偶病，不勝愁苦，乙來問云：兄是何病，所須何物？我皆能辦。甲云：我是害了銀子的病，只得二三鈸便殼了。乙即佯為未聞，乃吞嚥云：汝說甚麼？頌曰：黃金貴似佛法，佛法貴似黃金，覓時了不可得，吾已與汝安心」王一山怕就是甲乙一類人吧了。</p>
<h3>一對夫婦（一）</h3>
<p>— 白塵</p>
<p>三路電車從卡德路朝南開。在新閘橋停了。正是飯後三點鐘，上車的可不少。拖車門前的三等客人十有八個是短杉朋友，可是擠在小三等門前的却是長衫朋友了，並且還有個把個穿西裝的。頭等門口　，沒有人。——不，在小三等正擠着上人的當口，有兩位客人跑到頭等門口上去了。前頭是個男的，白白凈凈的面孔。，後頭是個女的，嘴唇上淡淡地打着口紅</p>
<p>頭等裏沒有人。男的只顧朝裏跑，女的進門歪下屁股就想坐。「嘩」的一聲，男的拉開玻璃門，鑽進三等車；女的回頭看了一眼跟進去。</p>
<p>男的擺開屁股拉開腿估了兩個位置坐下來。從小三等門口進來的一位朋友翻他個白眼。女的已經撿過來：男的兩腿一攏，女的坐下了。抬頭四面一看，低頭問男的：『三等？』</p>
<p>男的橫她一眼，頭一點。</p>
<p>搖搖幌幌過了一站。</p>
<p>「醬園弄！」</p>
<p>賣票的過來，惦惦手裏，銅板打大家面前一繞。</p>
<p>「有吧？他問：</p>
<p>男的不作聲。</p>
<h3>地藏誕</h3>
<p>— 唐錫如</p>
<p>到傍晚時，同居的幾個孩子，已像歸巢的小鳥似的，在噪聒着，在爭奪着審薯了，把蕃薯渾身揷上了燃着的棒香，活像刺蝟似的，再用綫穿住提在手裏，或是掛在廳堂上，就看住了這火星的刺蝟，濃烟直刺得眼都睜不開的跳着，喊着，跑着，高興到了不得。</p>
<p>看到這奇特的玩意兒，這纔像突然憶起久已遺忘的東西，想起今天是舊曆七月三十，是地藏王生日了。</p>
<p>聽到同屆的說，到天黑了，滿街都是大大小小的香球，有的用南瓜揷，有的用蕃薯，還有許多是用很大的飯瓜的，沿着每家門口的階沿，再是漫長的一長列的棒香，而且人家的門也關得早，所以今晚到街上去溜躂溜躂，是頗有另一種風味的。</p>
<p>給同居的這樣慫患了一下，本來是那晚不想出門了的，吃完晚餐，也就想出去看看了。</p>
<p>踏上黑暗的長街，街上有成　羣的野孩子在奔跑，在叫笑。眼前是火的小圓點排成的圖案，濃濃的烟，就是在這樣黑暗的夜裏，也可以看到它是在怎樣狂怒地噴着，本來不大好聞的棒香氣息，現在因為過分的濃重，是直把腦髓都醃辣了似的不能忍受了。</p>
<p>勉强的走了幾十家，終後是再也不能勉强的，抱了秤寃屈的情緒，趕緊跑了回來。</p>
<p>在跨進寓處的門口時，又給同居的撞見了。他含笑的招呼：</p>
<p>「不錯罷？那……！」</p>
<p>我覺得他的笑，是多少帶了種椰掄的成分的。</p>
<p>「棒香點得太多了，濃的不好受！」我說。</p>
<p>「啊！是地藏誕啊！」同居的有一些吃驚的。</p>
<p>「而且祇是點香，也太單調了，為什麼不夾些臘燭進去呢？」</p>
<p>「使不得！今天是地藏誕啊！」他重又吃驚的說。「他今晚要打這兒走過的！」</p>
<p>我本想說，多點幾支臘燭，少點幾把棒香，給他照亮一段路，敎他少打幾個噴嚏，地藏王不是更歡迎嗎？可是我看到他的嚴重臉色，便裝做已經懂得一切的「唔」「唔」幾聲。路進來了。</p>
<p>過了幾大，我才從旁人的嘴裏，曉得了全部的傳說。</p>
<p>地藏王因為他的權大，地位高，是輕易不開眼的。或許就是因為他不輕易開眼罷？要是他看到了人類那麼多的罪惡，那麼大的罪惡。他就瞧不順眼，要降給人類以災害了，像地震，瘟疫等等。這不會幾下子便把人類，毀減了嗎？不，人翻有對付的辦法。就是在這位菩薩出巡或是開眼的時候，名義上是歡迎他或是向他敬禮，實際上是把這濃濃的烟，直薰得他不敢正視一下，或是逗留一會的。這方法可以說是和賄賂上天時的灶君一般的「異曲同工」。</p>
<p>人類的至今還沒有絕滅，我們彷彿應該歸功於自己，能夠想出這樣巧妙的，兩全的對付方法來。</p>
<p>我已在廟宇裏看過地藏王的塑像了。莊嚴！偉大！可是眼睛是閉上的，我總覺得他的闔上眼皮，是被我們人類，——特別是罪孽深重的人們，强迫敎他闔上的。</p>
<p>而且我現在也相信，他是習慣這種生活了，而且他會願意。在受過無數次的欺騙以後。就是連人類特准給他開眼出巡的一天，都肯把眼睛閉上的。</p>
<h3>母親</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>就讓這零落的雨聲，敲回碎了遊子的心吧！</p>
<p>不，遊子的心，是早就破碎的了，—那還在八年前，盪起了時代之波的時候。</p>
<p>那時，自己很年輕。一個十六七歲的小女孩，懂得甚麼？然而，為了求學，也就乾脆的改變了自己的生活。記得：在開始放下了學着冰心寫些讚美母親的詩歌之筆後，就屏除了閑愁，强壯了自己，憧憬着光明，一樣也不怕的向前走去。</p>
<p>誰知就這樣，開始了自己的飄泊流浪的生涯。</p>
<p>我愛着母親，但我却給了她悲痛。一切舊世紀的母親們，在女兒身上所寄託着的希望，我一件也沒有給她。我給她的，是：</p>
<p>親戚們的嘲笑！封建社會的污蔑！……</p>
<p>也記得：她在自己面前哭泣的情况。我始而傷心，繼而悲憤！母親呵，為什麼你不能做一個廣大的人類的母親！</p>
<p>雖然自己知道，就是為了自己的純潔的勇敢的靑年的天眞，接受了人間的不幸。但想挽回這種不幸，顯然的只有擺脫一切，走上了自己的世紀的道路。</p>
<p>於此，我重復帶着滿身的創傷，離開了我親愛的母親。</p>
<p>五年來走過了南北，飽嘗了時代的苦酒。每看見白髮蕭肅的老人，由不得就想起了家中的丹親。</p>
<p>母親呵！不知你的白髪，已成了甚麼莫美？我只有白日猜想，夢裏尋思，拖着一個困頓的身子，又來到了這雨雨風風的異國。</p>
<p>異國情調不能打動我的心。飄泊慣了的人，早已忘記了天涯和故鄉的分別。只有想起母親米時，就會怕聽風的低吟，雨的嗚咽！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>陳仙洲古物助賑</h3>
<p>— 章繼</p>
<p>據二十四日中央社漢口電：鄂收藏家陳仙洲願以所藏古物四千餘件，價值八十萬元，悉數充作賑欵。這不能不說救賑聲中的一件大事。</p>
<p>本年各地水災，嚴重情形，倍於往昔，但在救濟方面，政府當局，旣沒有往年一樣的整個政策，雖然公務員捐薪助賑，已經下令實行，但是兩千萬元賑災公債，直到前日方由中政會議通過，還要交立法院審査，什麼時候能够發行，固然說不定，什麼時候能並到災民手裏，那更是不可說了。至於一般社會，也沒有往年一樣的熱烈，遊藝大會，花選舞選，鬧得一天星斗，結果送到義脤會的祇有一萬五千元，電影界用女明星來號召，究竟弄得多少，沒有看到公佈，但聽說收票處的地上，滿是撕碎的優待券，跳舞廳前雖然貼着「多跳一跳，多救一命」的標語，但塲子裏大家還是裏足不前，用美人魚來號召的賑災游泳，結果觀衆祇有一千餘人，足球賽如何，本埠的我們還不知道，南京的也祇到千餘人，未來的童子軍總動員募賑，以過去的成績而論，也不見得會有驚人的收獲。</p>
<p>這種現象，我們分析起來，大部分的原因，自然由於社會經濟普遍不景氣，自救不暇，遑論救人；但人心的已死，也可見一斑。何則？今日社會經濟固然不景氣，但儘有許多富貴人家，他們靠着祖宗的餘蔭，與目前的搜括，可以不受影響，然而他們也不肯拔一毛而利天下，這還不是人心已死的證據麼？</p>
<p>現在陳仙洲居然肯把他所藏的四千餘件古物，全部犧牲，在這人心已死中，不能不說是人類光明的透露，可以作一般守財奴的當頭棒喝！我們知道，古物之類，固然被稱為「身外之物」，但以一個愛好古物的人，而肯以古物贈人，况價值在八十萬之鉅，這若非有慷慨好義的精神，必然辦不到，因之陳仙洲的這種舉動，尤其值得我們欽佩讚頌。</p>
<p>上海為人文薈萃之區，古物的收藏家，像陳仙洲這樣豐富的，當不在少，但像陳仙洲這樣慷慨好義的，尚未之見；我們很希望聞風興起，不讓專美於前，並正吿辦賑務諸公，還是從這方面着眼，不要再從女人身上打主意了。</p>
<h3>職業</h3>
<p>— 斯</p>
<p>被鬧鐘從甜夢中驚醒回來，房里是漆黑一片。他揉着惺忪的睡眼，回味着夢中的幻境，生活的壓迫的苦痛又像蛇一樣地在他心頭爬動。對於眼前的職業，他幾次想掉了不幹，薪金是那樣菲薄，每天自朝至暮不終地工作，還養不活自己。接到父親寫來血淚的家書時侯，他竟是沒有勇氣提起筆來；這樣的生活，能並說給父親聽嗎，而且對於父親的欲望怎樣答覆呢？</p>
<p>房內已經漏進灰白的光綫了，這正象徵着他自己的前途。免强地從床上起來，扭亮了電燈，時間已是飛快地過了十幾分鐘。把熱水瓶中的隔夜水來洗了面，在鏡中瞧見自己憔悴的面色，如亂麻一般的思潮不由他再作無謂的幻想，人是要生活的呵！</p>
<p>走出門來，天空是白霧茫茫，馬路靜悄悄地沒有一個行人，都市的早晨是够蕭條的，人不為利，睢肯早起？偶然一瞧見幾個穿紅馬甲的淸道夫，灣着腰，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>像一只失了主人　寵的老馬，有一帚沒一帚地掃着從樹頭上飄零下來的枯葉。但是那些禿了頂的樹枝大半已有稻草包紮起來了，樹枝預備過冬，那可憐的淸道夫呢，呵着氣，聳起肩頭，要挨過這個像一世紀那樣長的冬天的呵！</p>
<p>他在弄口的餅攤上買了幾個餅充飢。餅攤上的主人和他十分熟識了，每天總是笑嘻嘻地間着早啊。他雖然明知這是店主對於顧客的一種手段，但是這世間還有熱情的話，他亦很感到滿足了。每天從搭上電車到歸那狹小的囚籠，還有一個人看作他是同樣的一個人嗎？</p>
<p>他總是乘着出廠的弟一輛電車。車箱里賣票打着瞌睡，他們似乎也相繼了，點點頭，買了票，各自佔了個角落，把腦袋低垂下來，讓自己再享受一點安閑的時間。到大馬路外灘下車，江海關上的大鐘已是七時二十分了。他踏着宿露未醒的碼頭，尋到一艘有紅烟突標記的小汽輸，通見同事的時候，互相點點頭，幾架機械似的爬進艙里。這里似乎感到一點溫暖。大家抽着姻，或是翻着當天的報紙，這個時間是十分寶貴的，之後他們就要做十小時的牛馬。汽輪是七時半開，要四十五分的時間到廠，不過也有例外的時侯，就是洋大班到遲點是可以通融的，至於職員搭不到這汽輪，如果沒有預前請假，你就犧牲兩天的工資，雖然也是寫字間的職員，他們和工人一樣看待的。</p>
<p>當初他看到報上聘請打字員的廣吿，是這家公司的上海寫字間。半天的考試，在數十個想搶奪飯碗之羣中他僥倖獲選了是。但第二天他上寫字間的時侯，洋大人命令他到浦東的廠里去，優待方面自然使他失望，而他的大學生的身份亦被視工人一樣的猪仔了！但是人是要生活的，他有勇氣拒絕這命令嗎？</p>
<p>汽輪劃破了江面上的濃霧，飛速的前進，那轆轆的引擎聲，就像鐵錘似的打在艙里每個人的心房上。雖然大家交換着熱誠的目光，却沒有一個人能够打破這沉寂的局面的，每個人有蒼面的臉，遲鈍的動動動作。在這個時間中，他一定放目到江面上，望着澎湃的怒潮，看牠勇敢地一浪接着一浪打上船舷來；直到汽輪轉進了小港，江水才像鏡心一樣平靜，他的心才跟着靜止下來。但是那個高高的廠房的紅牆已從艙穴中映進眼簾了。返視同命運的人們都鼓起精神來預　上岸，不過他反覺得疲乏　不能動彈</p>
<h3>靜夜市聲</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>這里原是一個小鎭市尾，一到夜里，一切都就更變得沉靜了，走道旁的梧桐葉子飄落地下的輕聲，籬外村道上過路人的步響和咯咳，都極其淸晰的聽得出來。房子正好臨近大路，雖是深夜，這小鎭上唯一的賣夜市的餛飩柝子，每夜都會在一定的時刻，敲着不變的調子，舒徐悠慢的由遠而近的走過去；每每聽著這不變的柝子漸漸的走近來，又漸漸的沉下去，心神輒為之悠然響往，覺得這個柝聲，實比隣家的收音機播出來的俚歌俗樂好聽得多。</p>
<p>好久以來都只聽見這僅有的餛飩柝子。在這小鎭里我倒不覺得奇怪，直到近幾夜來，才在餛飩担子未過去之先，多了一個賣檀香橄欖的叫賈聲昔，起初我原聽小出他喊賣的究竟是什麼東西，只覺　在他喊買的三種不同的聲調語氣里都充蘊着一種很使人感動的凄凉的韻致。我受不下這賣聲的誘致，不禁走到房門口向隔籬望去。在小小的籬柵罅隙里很寂寞的漏進一盞昏弱的燈火，隨着一個糢糊的人影凄凉地踅過去。</p>
<p>我當時站在門口，情感是全給這個迷惑住了，直望著那盞淒涼的燈火掩隱在一道矮牆里去，才若有所失似地退回書案前來。我很後悔，為什麼不喊住那個叫賣者，看看他究竟是一個怎麼樣的人，也許就是一個傴樓病弱的老人罷，說不定他還會為自己背述他的凄凉的生涯，且從自己手里換去幾個難得的銅板。</p>
<p>這一夜，我的心情可眞給那個凄凉的叫賣聲擾亂，直到睡在牀上，心里總像遺落了什麼，又像是背人做了一回什麼歉心事。當餛飩柝子敲着悠悠的聲調走過去以後，這小鎭似乎更變得沉靜下來，尤其是階前的梧桐葉子飄落地下的輕響，遠村的狗叫，瑟瑟的風聲，都斷斷續續的强調了這小鎭的靜夜的凄凉氣氛。我從來對於秋風秋雨都很是平淡的忽略過去，很少體味到它的動人的境界，這夜可異樣了，這為一般敏感的詩人，遊子所咏嘆傷懷的秋之夜籟，竟也深深的打動我這顆冥頑的心，也許正因我腦子里老是在惦念着那個洋溢着凄凉韻致的叫賣聲，聯想到那個可憐的販者，在這露凉風凄的深夜，還要為生涯担受苦楚。</p>
<p>幾個夜都這樣過去了，我也從一個小孩子口里探知這是賣的檀香橄欖，他還把買來的拿給我看。從它的　形看來，這小小的堅硬的東西，也許就不會有如何好吃的滋味的；也似平不見有人聽到喊賣聲就走出來和他購買。我雖然好像很關心這個喊賣聲，但每到臨頭又給習慣所囿，要走出弄門口去向担販購買零食，平素就認為很為難的。只有一次，看見三個小孩將他圍在一塊，我曾走前去。一盞四角框玻璃煤油燈歪側地放在木桶一邊，木桶內蓋着一層厚厚的棉布，布色已很污舊了，人正蹲在木桶邊，一隻粗大的手抓起一隻靑花磁盤，向下一挖，盤里就托出幾顆暗靑色的橄欖，幾隻白嫩的小手就很快的伸去抓揀，還雜着揀小擇大爭執的吵聲。小孩子散開後，人頭也不抬的又背起木桶向前走去了。我只有站在一邊，默默的望着他的微微傴僂的背影，提起兩隻瘦弱的腿在火影光里艱難地移動過去，那三種不同的充蘊着凄凉韻致的叫賣聲，又隨着夜風播揚在黑暗的村道上。……</p>
<p>直到現在，夜夜在餛飩担子未過去之先，我都聽得到這個凄凉的叫賈聲，每每一燈獨對，戶外風露蕭瑟，犬吠隱隱，輒為之掩卷默息，就覺得這小鎭的夜是更寂寞得可怕。</p>
<h3>秋感</h3>
<p>— 修斯</p>
<p>對於秋有有識有感覺的時候，那是在做小學生當年讀了歐陽修的秋聲賦以後。而那時對秋的認識亦很簡單，只是：氣候凉爽，有明亮的中秋月，有東南風可以放紙鳶。南邊的氣候近熟帶，就是秋天，樹木亦不見得怎樣的凋零，落葉的美景是很少見到的。因此對於秋的感覺，是一種愉快的心情。何况還有放紙鳶的樂事呢。（到了北邊來，這才對於小學敎科書所說的「芳草地，放風箏」的春天放風箏有了實感，在故鄉時是駡編敎科書的人胡說八道的哩）。</p>
<p>據說文人悲　為的是文人苦感，我雖然亦很敏感，可是半生以來對於秋并沒有感覺得令我悲哀的時候。而且在我的生活上，對於秋天的氣候凉爽不寒不熱，反而威覺到喜歡愉樂。</p>
<p>別人悲秋，而我可却是愛秋喜秋的</p>
<p>少時的愛秋，那自然是因為有了放紙鳶。而我們南邊放的風箏，除了人鳥虫魚之外，遝有一種就如戰鬥飛機一樣，可以在天空上戰鬥的紙鳶。我最喜歡放這一種戰鬥的紙鳶。形式和日本的紙鳶差不多，可是放的綫是用膠水將玻璃粉沾上去的，製法又與別的不同，在空中可以上下左右操縱自如，要追要跑都不成問題，我好像用無綫電指揮飛機一樣，眞有趣。如果對那會叫的風箏，或無美麗的紙鳶，起了嫉姤的心，不管她在好遠的地方，自己的放了出去，翻個筋斗，自己的綫壓在她的綫上，儘量的放，利用綫上的玻璃粉的磨擦作用，就將她的綫切繼了。橫衝直撞，左右馳騁，簡直成了天空的親王。如果不幸亦遇着別人的戰鬥紙鳶，那就不能稱覇，只好兩雄决個你死我活了。到了這個决鬥的時候，那就要看誰的玻璃綫長短了，短的就輸，那是無法抵抗的事。這種戰鬥紙鳶，同時還好比潛水艇一樣，放的人不是在芳草地，而是站在自己屋頂上，誰都不明白是從那裏來的。如果綫長，幾里外的人更莫名其妙了。如今十年沒有歸故鄉了，不知在這東南風正緊的故鄉裏，小朋友們是怎樣在空中戰鬥的呵：！讀「紅樓夢」時，對於大觀園裏的哥兒小姐們以放風箏為放走晦氣的舉動，我是覺得可笑的；但少時就養成好鬥的性格，想來該是年來到處碰壁，一事無成的原因吧？</p>
<p>中秋月我是不喜歡的。可是我却喜歡在那一夜上，於月光如畫的時侯，放我的紙鳶。夜裏放紙鳶，如果沒有月亮，那眞無味；有了月亮，看得出紙鳶合白雲在賽跑，興趣無窮一有人喜歡在黑夜裏放風箏，聽她的叫聲，我不高興這，看不到自己的風箏在天空那裏，只聽到聲音，又有什麼意思呢？而其實行我不高興的，却還是因為天黑，雖然聽到人家的風箏的叫聲很嫉姤，却不知道風箏究竟在那裏，沒法放戰鬥的紙鳶出去耀武揚威這一點上哩。中秋夜那就不同，月光如　，與人打仗也好，襲擊大家亦好，都是知已知彼地看得淸淸榮的。</p>
<p>到了北邊來了以後，對於秋的認　和感覺，又有另一番不同了。而將我的心靈沉醉在秋的懷裏的時候，那是在蛇山之麓讀書的時期；自從風塵僅僅到處奔波以後，那一種形緒是沒有的了。如今回憶起來，就好像在做夢一樣地沉醉着了。</p>

<p>我們的學校，隔壁有一個小公園，那是張之洞的抱氷堂遺址。公園而在學校的隔壁，成為校園似地游憇之所那是必然的現象。而且那裏僻靜淸幽，遊人很少，還成為男女同學所談愛的地方。春天的時候，滿園都是桃花，一進門美麗得有如天邊紅霞似地誘惑着人們旺起了靑春的火燄，遊人多一點；到了秋天，白楊蕭蕭瑟瑟地在樹梢頭哀鳴，落葉滿地飛，遊人絕跡，就成了我們學生獨佔的世界，尤其是我最喜歡到園裏去走走坐坐。走過了桃樹林，上幾步石級，從一座深閉門的大廳轉過後面，再走深一層，在那裏依山的斜坡下滿種着白楊樹，茅亭四周滿種着各色各樣的菊花，只要在茅亭裏坐一下，耳朶可以聽白楊的交響曲，眼睛可以賞菊花的爭吐艷，還可以望望碧空里在飛着的白雲，—秋是以倩新俊逸的姿態來親近你，使你沉醉在她的溫柔嫵媚的懷裏。</p>
<p>何况有時還有女友可以談心，吟詩，唱歌呢！</p>
<h3>雲</h3>
<p>— 微茫</p>
<p>雲，是可愛的。你看那變幻多端，色彩倏變，活潑玲瓏，輕飄高蕩，風捲時像萬馬奔騰，雨麗時像高潮膨湃，有時是多麼的纖麗，有時又是多麼的壯美呢！</p>
<p>雲是跟季節而變幻的：春天時輕盈盈地，嬌弱有如少女：夏天則濃厚粗豪，有如壯士顏色；秋天有如樸素少婦，淡裝輕描；冬天則像嚴峻法官，面目冰冷，鐵面無情，人愛春之和秋天的雲，或許那是對少女和少婦的傾慕吧？而對夏天和冬天的雲的鄙厭，那或許便是對男子漢的醜惡的面相的鄙薄了？</p>
<p>然而人也有對夏天的雲加以鑽美的，譬如夏日落山，彩霞西掛的時候，黑靈是多麼地奇態萬端呀！像人，像獸，像花草，像蟲魚：小孩子對這種瞬息萬變的象形人物，是多麼地覺得有趣呢！便是有男子氣的，看那夏雲帶來了雷聲，並且捲來了時雨，一陣狂風捲過，黑雲便飄下了大顆的陣雨，那景象是多麼地雄壯，多麼地象徵着一個狂颷的時代呀！</p>
<p>至於冬天的雲，似乎便沒有聽過人對於它的讚美了。因為那是多麼地陰沈，多麼悽慘慘地，冷泳冰地，會把人的心情造成抑鬰多愁的啊！冬天的雲是富於暮氣的，那麼呆板板地，或許老年人會加以同情吧，至於朝氣正盛的年輕人，着起來怎會發生同感呢？此外或許科學家們，扳起正經面孔的道德家，和毫無情感的執法家們，會加以讚美吧？</p>
<p>春天的雲之愛靑年人的愛好，不只在它的輕巧玲瓏，活潑可愛的一方面，或許那也是愛的徵象吧？你看它溫柔纖媚，在靑草如茵的花園上飛，在春風和煦的氣溫裏輕蕩，飄過了愛人們的眼角，也飄進了戀人們的心底。那種空氣，那種環境，一朶春雲在空間悠悠地飄過，靑年們怎麼不會在愛的熱情中沈醉着呢？</p>
<p>藝術家和詩人們卻愛着秋天的雲了。在電影鏡頭裏，在美術照相上，秋天的雲是常常被收入鏡底的。那原因是秋天的天氣特別地淸朗，特別地睛明而高爽，狂颷是沒有的，便是狂熱與愁慘的容顏也沒有看見。這時候的雲兒是淡薄的，每每在邊綠上還嵌上潔白的銀鑲秋天的雲是多彩的，多邊的，像嬌憨的孩嬰，也像純情高潔的婦女，藝術家們怎麼不愛它？而詩人們又怎麼不歌詠它呢？</p>
<p>至於雨中的雲和高山的雲，也為人們愛好的對象。你看山雨欲來時，雲朶迅捷地從天中飛過，旣像萬軍的奔馳，也像黑女的舞藝。而雨來時從雨絲迷濛中觀看天上的遊雲，那種迷糊跳蕩的恣態，和那罩着黑紗般的魔術境界，多麼令人迷感和感署神秘意味呢？</p>
<p>環繞山腰的雲和浮蕩於山巔的薄雲，是屢被畫家和文人們所描摩於筆底的了。因為一個尖立的山而被斬為二截，或一個山頭而被戴上了雲冠，那形象是確為美觀而令人愛的。並且因為山中水氣多，樹林多，浮雲　積，到處充塞，於是山谷和山澗，榭梢和石頭，每每受着輕薄的浮雲所光顧，使山間景象，朝夕不同，瞬息萬變，由白雲所造成的美景，當然非禿禿的小山所可比擬的了。否則廬山的雲景，怎麼會使人們嘆為奇觀的呢？</p>

<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>袁牧之去了一次南京以後，「據說」要脫離電通了。</p>
<p>脫離電通的原因，據袁牧之的私人宣傳包可「顰」說，是為了受不了孫師毅的排擠。</p>
<p>前天，包可「　」就拿了那篇宣傳稿向各報托登，可是結果，等各報館打電話到電通去問，電通的同人可怔住了，他們說，根本沒知道哀牧之辭職的事，就連袁牧之有辭職的意思也不知道。</p>
<p>袁牧之如果眞的離開電通，（事實上是决不會的，這是巧妙的宣傳，也是借刀殺人的詭計，）有的說將到日本去，（據說馬德建老闆曾有這樣的話。。一牧之如果到日本去，一切費用由他負担。）」也有說將進明星。</p>
<p>進明星，那是不大有可能的，因為我們知道，明星現在已經有了應雲衛在那兒了。</p>

<h3>危險關頭</h3>

<h3>欽差大臣攝影小記</h3>
<p>那晚上，第三塲的電影亦已經散了，金城的樓上還是鬧哄哄的，原來業餘劇人正在準備攝拍欽差大臣一的化裝劇照哩。</p>
<p>演員們興奮的玩皮的調笑着，亦有的在燙髮，有的在試服裝，多是活潑的有署朝氣的跳躍署，惟楊霽明和辛漢文二位大師，冷靜的各自來處理他們的工具，一個在臺上配燈光和擺鏡頭，一個在樓上整理化裝品，和趕製縣長顧而已的頭套。</p>
<p>殷秀岑和　茫，本是劇本中的一對勞萊和哈台，老殷在他的大面盤上還要加厚了鼻子，愈使人覺得好笑。</p>
<p>施超的化裝，簡直有十足的俄國風味，那唇鬚，那眼圈，那鼻子，在霞飛路一帶，常能遇見到像他那晚上那樣的人的。</p>
<p>老辛差不多想把畢生的精力，在那晚上多施展出來，實在演員亦太多了，老辛精細的把每個演員的性格，條子，極有把握的用油彩和舊筆來刻劃出來。</p>
<p>老楊起前有着他太太在帮忙，後來的間晚了，於是就留老楊一個人在工作。導演章泯，是個好好先生，伏在臺口下指揮着演員們的姿勢</p>
<p>演員在化裝上以鄭君里為最成功，簡直有拉斯蒲丁的神態。顧而已的形態最發噱，肚子用枕頭裝來跟大胖子股秀岑差不多，頭上戴着新做成的頭套，鼻子裝得圓圓的，一走出化裝間，別人都驚異的不認識他了。</p>
<p>金山那天化裝得眞漂亮，挺直的軍裝，臉上涂滿了二號油彩，手裏玩着一個獨鏡的眼鏡，眞是一個紈袴少年。</p>
<p>到最後是王瑩跟葉露茜去上鏡頭，時間差不多要天亮了，當王瑩走到臺下，老楊却睡着在沙發椅上了，王小姐催呌着「楊小綿羊，快些起來跟我拍吧，呀！睡着了可憐死了」，老楊一面整理起乾片，一面說；「工作太認眞了，拍照拍一夜天，眞是生平第一次」。</p>

<h3>美國擴展汽車製造業</h3>
<p>投資鉅欵一萬萬金元</p>
<p>據美國汽車業重心底特律地方傳來的消息，美國的各大汽車業鉅子，現在正計劃着一種偉大而切效的擴張策劃，其所計劃中要花的金錢，聽說達美金一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，這真是一個可觀的數目哩，自從一九一九以來。直到最近數年間的經濟上衰落，差不多各地各業都籠罩着不景氣的愁霧，不要說投資的數目。如此鉅大，為一九一九年以來各業所從未有的創舉，還有許多廠家因為受着經濟打擊，而致一蹶不振的，也多得很呢。</p>
<p>上面所說的美金一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，是包括各大汽車廠擴展計劃中所定的金額全數而言，其中大槪為（一）新型車的設計和製造費，這筆費用為數不在甚少，因為一年一度，各廠都有新型車的設計和製造，在這時候大家都很競爭的當兒，各廠多不惜工本，羅致人才來做這件重要工作，現在秋季已過，冬季開始，正是各廠鈎心鬬角，極力製造新型車的重要節季，幾家爭先的車廠已將一九三六年新車樣車製造完竣，從下月起，就要給予經售商先期觀看，作為推銷上計設的幫助，據說十一月二日在紐約就要有這樣宗旨的一個預觀展覽會，因為製造新型車，工廠的設備和工作，也就連帶的要擴充和增進，自然也要有大量的金錢去應付。</p>
<p>（二）恢復已經歇閉的工廠，各大汽車製造廠的工塲，有許多因為受市面凋零，經濟打擊的影響，近年來都暫時停歇，以致緊縮，現在因為市塲有好轉的曙光，而一千九百三十六年又轉瞬卽屆，大家都很興奮的集中力量來工作，於是有幾處已經閉歇多年的工塲，多要計劃恢復，重新動工，這一件事在事實上，自然也要花費許多金錢，像置備工具哩，修繕廠屋哩，僱用工人哩，在在需欵，一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，的數目雖大，有這兩筆大支出，也就所餘不多了。</p>
<p>這個一萬萬金元的大投資，不用說又是美國汽車業中兩大巨孹－通用，和福特的最大支出之一，通用所已經計劃定當的投資數目為美金五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，福特所已經宣佈的工廠擴展費為美金二七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，這種計劃中已有若干點已在動手進行之中了，此外還要用幾百萬元的金錢，去置備新工具，預備製造一九三六年式新車。</p>
<p>汽車業中人早就說，他們一方面是經濟恐慌的先覺者，一方面又是恢復工作的先鋒隊，因之在世界不景氣來襲的幾年中，汽車業也早就吃苦，而現在呢，好像有一線恢復曙光，因之汽車業也就有漸漸向榮的表徵，幾年以來，汽車買主購置力的最衰弱地步，要算一九三二年了，期間各廠都極力緊縮，在生產上，凡不需要的支出，一槪從省，所以像工具的塡舊和添置等，也暫緩進行，可是到年底，把結賬後的借貨表來看，還是虧折哩。（虞）</p>
<h3>汽車用狄塞爾引擎發展史（四）</h3>
<p>— 朱義生</p>
<p>因狄塞爾引擎行駛成績之優美。現下各種耕田機車亦多裝用。據經騐所得。每天一狄塞爾引擎耕田機所消耗的車油。尚不到駕機者一天的飯金。</p>
<p>在其他的各種用途上。狄塞爾引擎亦已有驚人的發展。舉凡起重機也。挖泥機也。軋石機也。冷氣機也。一共有二十餘廠家都預備將他們的出品用狄塞爾引擎為原動力。在水面上。我人可見到各式大小船隻莫不裝用狄塞爾引擎。大郵船如奧巨斯多斯號。長七百餘英尺。排水量三萬噸。行駛歐美間亦裝用狄塞爾推進機。其次如英國克那特公司之喬其克號。及勃利他尼克號。排水量各二萬七千噸。亦均裝用狄塞爾引擎。現下全世界載油之貨船幾乎什九裝有狄塞爾引擎。</p>
<p>上海法租界之水電廠已全部改用狄塞爾引擎。而在歐美各國都市則更無論矣。巴拿馬運河之大水閘亦利用狄塞爾引擎以啟閉。礦中湧出之原油。在千餘里長之輸送管內。亦賴狄塞爾引擎轉動帮浦以傾灌輸送之。</p>
<p>現下歐美各狄塞爾引擎製造廠。成覺到此項引擎之日臻於完美。正從事於標準式的製造。能使將來一則減輕工本。二則便於裝配。</p>
<p>在航空方面。狄塞爾引擎之優點亦是很明顯的。（一）他因用油的經濟。可多載傎價的重量。（二）重油着火不易燃燒。在安全上得一重大保障。（三）汽油機用打火塞及化汽箱最易發生障碍。狄塞爾引擎則并此而無之。數年前派克汽車廠造成狄塞爾飛機引擎一具。馬力二百二十五匹。重量五百十磅。實開飛機用狄塞爾引擎之先聲。現下歐美各强正從事於研究飛機狄塞爾引擎的構造。使能於他乎一旦電氣死光完成。汽油機所用之電氣傢具勢將失其效用。而狄塞爾引擎則與電力無緣。可以不受死光影響也。所以法蘭西現正懸賞一百萬法郎。給與任何人能發明一種飛機用狄塞爾引擎。可裝配於驅逐機上。而能與汽油機有同等之速力者。</p>
<p>穿越法蘭西邊境。我人可見到德國魯登柴航空公司正從事裝置狄塞爾引擎於他的運輸飛機上。此項飛機卽將來戰爭中之轟炸機。在最近試飛時。一隻永固廠製造仇磨式狄塞爾引擎。在一萬一千四百尺高度之天空。可發出馬力六百五十匹。他的每匹馬力所佔重量為二磅又六。此外各廠如英之日光廠。意之菲阿廠。及法之克來也廠。對狄塞爾飛機引擎之試騐。均有可取的成績。</p>
<p>目下美國西部某廠。已着手於一具大型飛機用狄塞爾引擎的製造。他是一具倒Ｖ式的十二汽筩水凉引擎。他的計劃者是一個比國工程師。他的馬力可發揮到一千二百匹云。</p>

<h3>Unopened Xianghe City Gate, Security Team Temporarily Stationed in Suburbs, City Order Reportedly Restored, Vagrants Inciting Ignorant People in Neighboring Counties</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The city gate of Xianghe County was still not opened this morning. The city is still patrolled and guarded by the head of the security corps, Jiang Enliang, leading his guards. The 7th Company of the 1st Regiment of Zhang Qingyu's security force, which set out from Xiapu, Sanhe to Xianghe yesterday, only reached the north bank of the Jiankan River, about six miles from the county seat, this morning and has not yet entered the city. Around 7:00 AM this morning, the security team sent a representative to call at the city gate. Gao Junshan, the director of the Public Security Bureau, replied on the city wall, saying that he had not received formal orders and could not open the city. He requested that the security team wait outside the city. The security team representative, with no results from the negotiation, had no choice but to station the entire team at the Jiankan River to await orders. A representative Zhang, sent by the Hebei Provincial Government, entered the city with two Japanese this morning. After Zhang and others entered the city, the city gate was closed. It is not yet certain whether it will be opened this afternoon. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Xianghe incident, after negotiation by Shang Zhen in Tianjin, has been resolved satisfactorily. Shang arrived in Ping by train last night. This morning, in a written statement to visitors, he said that after the Xianghe incident is resolved, the provincial government is discussing candidates to succeed the county magistrate and a decision will be made soon. The demands of the mutineers are rumored to be: 1. Allowing the farmers' demands; 2. Not punishing those responsible; 3. Providing compensation for casualties. However, the provincial government has not heard of these demands. Liu Yaodong has arrived in Ping and has not yet met. It is not known whether he is still willing to be the magistrate of Xianghe County. The security police are only temporarily stationed in Xianghe. It is rumored that the farmers in Xianghe once demanded that 55% of the land tax be retained for local construction in the county, but this is not the case. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Qingyu, commander of the First Security Regiment, came to Tianjin in the afternoon of the 29th to meet with Yin Rugeng. According to the conversation, it was the Fifth Company of his regiment that was sent to Xianghe, and it is currently near Dachang outside the city. The order inside the city is still good, and the bandits on the Great Wall line have been cleared. He will go to Ping tonight to meet with Chairman Shang and Commissioner Yin to request instructions on defense matters. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Riotous people are still lurking in Xianghe City. There are many accomplices of Wu Zhenyi. Wu Zizhenhua is still instigating in the nearby suburbs. Important files of the county government's Public Security Bureau have been burned by rioters, and many land tax registers have been lost. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain country's vagrants support Wu Zhenyi and others. In the Gengyu Lane, Mingshi Street, in a certain concession in Tianjin, they formed the United Association of Representatives from Various Counties in Hebei, secretly sending people to various counties to carry out activities. They still plan to incite chaos in the name of popular autonomy. Reports have been sent to the Tianjin Security Command from Sanhe, Wuqing, Anci, and Jinghai, stating that certain country's vagrants are active and inciting ignorant people to rebel. Traitors planned to instigate ignorant people to gather at Ningyuan in Tianjin on the 28th, petitioning to the Tianjin-Gubei Security Command and the Municipal Government in the name of a popular autonomy petition group. The city authorities learned of this in advance and took measures to disband it, which was not realized. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Leaflets and declarations distributed under the name of the United Association of Representatives from Various Counties in Hebei, as well as the declaration of the Chinese Democratic League, were found in the Japanese concession in Tianjin. Both declarations are absurd and outrageous. It was found that they were forged by traitors to attack the government. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Qingyu, commander of the First Security Regiment of Hebei Province, came to Tianjin from Tong County in the afternoon of the 29th. According to the conversation, this unit was previously ordered to send a company to station in Dachang, Xianghe. The order in the city has been restored, and the neighboring counties are also very peaceful. (29th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jiang Enliang, head of the Xianghe County Security Corps, fled on the 28th for fear of being condemned for once siding with the rioters. Most of the militiamen also fled. The businessmen and residents elected Wang Futong, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to temporarily serve as deputy commander of the regiment. Starting on the 29th, he recruited the unit to assist the security team in guarding the city. Gunshots were still heard in Xianghe City on the evening of the 28th. Local ruffians disbanded and took the opportunity to rob wealthy households. Hu's battalion of the 175th Regiment of the 32nd Army sent a company of soldiers to Xixiaotun Village outside Xianghe on the evening of the 28th. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Xianghe incident has been resolved, which is a relief to people here. This is because the people from all walks of life previously believed that the Xianghe incident was enough to affect the situation elsewhere in Hebei Province. There were rumors here a few days ago that someone was plotting similar actions in Tianjin, but the public believes that the serious situation has passed. (29th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng went to Ping at 4 PM on the 29th. According to the conversation, he did not participate in the negotiations on the Xianghe incident because it was not a matter within the war zone. The case has not been completely resolved. The security team can only reach Shichang, fifteen miles outside the city. The original police force in the city maintains order. He is currently busy with winter defense meetings.

<h3>The Italian-Abyssinian Question and the Sino-Japanese Question</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Recently, with the British parliamentary re-election imminent, foreign policy has become the focus of debate between the government party and the opposition party. This debate not only concerns the political struggle in Britain, but also affects the attitude of the world towards Britain. Foreign Secretary Hoare has vigorously defended the British policy on the Italian-Abyssinian question as impartial and disinterested. The leader of the Labor Party, however, cited the attitude of the British government towards the Sino-Japanese question after September 18 to prove that the current policy is not purely for the sake of collective peace. Because Britain disregarded its obligations under the League of Nations Covenant in the Manchurian question, enabling Japan to carry out its atrocities and initiating a precedent for aggression without being subject to collective sanctions, Britain cannot shirk its responsibility for its non-interventionist policy. Eden, a member of the cabinet, then cited two things to explain the different nature of the two questions. One is that the League of Nations did not declare Japan an aggressor after the Manchurian incident, and the other is that two important Pacific countries were not members of the League of Nations at the time. In law and in fact, Britain could not treat Japan in the same way as Italy. Is Eden's statement credible? Are the two questions of a different nature?</p>
<p>We believe that if British politicians want to show great faith to the world, they should bravely admit their past mistakes and not make such self-deceptive explanations. Japan occupied and awarded Manchuria. Was it an act of aggression? Has the territorial integrity and political independence in Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant been violated by the Kwantung Army? The power to declare Japan an aggressor rests with the League of Nations Executive Council, and the person who changed the Executive Council was Sir Simon, a member of the current cabinet. If Eden says that Japan's undeclared war does not constitute an act of war, then why did Italy's invasion of Abyssinia not formally declare war? Both were violations of the treaty, both were acts of aggression, and both defied the world's disapproval. Moreover, Japan was the first and Italy followed suit. Why is Britain so generous to this and so harsh to that? Eden's statement that the two questions have different meanings in law is a forced argument that is not credible.</p>
<p>Although the United States and Russia were not members of the League of Nations at the time, to say that Britain was worried about the lack of cooperation from the United States and Russia in shouldering the responsibility for sanctions is a misrepresentation of the facts. At that time, the United States most strongly expressed its hatred for Japanese aggression. Stimson's expression was unprecedented in the history of American diplomacy. Soviet Russia is one of the countries directly threatened by Japan. If wolves are about to enter the room, those in the room who want to drive away the wolves must not be less than their neighbors. Moreover, the United States and Russia are both signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. According to Stimson's interpretation of the pact, it can also be invoked to impose sanctions. In addition, there is the Nine-Power Treaty, which stipulates the protection of China's territorial integrity and political independence, which is the same as Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant. The United States and Britain both have responsibilities. The collective peace in the Pacific is built on the Washington Treaty, and the collective peace in Europe is built on the Geneva system. There is no difference between the two. If Britain is impartial and disinterested, and its loyalty to collective peace should not be different because of Asia and Africa, then how can Eden's statement that the Sino-Japanese question and the Italian-Abyssinian question are different in fact be justified?</p>
<p>In short, Britain's active activities in the Italian-Abyssinian question today do not make up for the prestige of the League of Nations. However, its motive is in its own interests, and collective peace is just an excuse. Its indifference to the Sino-Japanese question and its responsibility for the Italian-Abyssinian question are due to the different degrees of influence of these two questions on the safety of the lifeblood of the British Empire. Britain is now facing such a difficult situation in the Italian-Abyssinian question because it did not take responsibility for the Sino-Japanese question in the past. People without foresight must have immediate worries. Will the pragmatic British diplomats also know to reflect on this?</p>

<h3>Draft of Armistice Plan Between Italy and Abyssinia by British and French Experts Based on Mussolini's Conditions, Still Requiring Approval from the League of Nations and Britain and Abyssinia, Papal Representative Exerts Great Effort in Peaceful Mediation</h3>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that British and French experts have drafted an armistice plan between Italy and Abyssinia, which will soon be submitted separately to the League of Nations Administrative Council and the Italian government. Although the details have not been disclosed, it is known that a British expert took the draft back to London on Monday to consult with British Foreign Secretary Hoare. If approved, it will be submitted to the League of Nations. It is also reported that the plan is based on Mussolini's armistice conditions, although most of it has been reduced, it still inevitably involves the cession of much territory. The British government's policy is that any plan must be approved by the League of Nations and Abyssinia before serious consideration. Some sources in Paris have indicated that if this armistice counterproposal can be accepted by all parties, the League of Nations' sanctions actions should be slowed down to promote a calm environment conducive to peace talks. A spokesperson also said that the content of the plan is currently being kept strictly secret to avoid external misinterpretations of British and French actions outside the scope of the League of Nations. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed observers deeply believe today that Britain will oppose Italy's open or disguised annexation of the Tigray province of Abyssinia. It is claimed that the province is the region of King Abyssinia's own Amhara tribe, while Italy believes that the province should be Italian territory or a trusteeship. It is learned today that Britain does not intend to inform King Abyssinia of the peace conditions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, apparently acknowledging that such suggestions have no value as a basis for future negotiations. The British government also believes that the Italian proposals are insufficient to warrant a change in the consideration of implementing sanctions. However, although immediate compromise is impossible, actions to explore opinions are reportedly continuing in an effort to peacefully resolve the East African dispute. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the "Le Petit Parisien," regarding the proposal to designate the southern provinces of Abyssinia, that is, the area bordering Italian Somaliland, as an Italian protectorate, League of Nations officials said that it contradicts the principles of the League of Nations Covenant and seems difficult to consider. The most likely solution would be to implement a mandate in the area. However, the biggest difficulty at present is the fate of the religious holy city of Aksum in the Tigray province, as the area around the city has been conquered by Italian forces, while Abyssinia still insists on preserving its independence and sovereignty. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the Pope is currently taking cautious diplomatic action to seek an early end to the bloodshed in Abyssinia. The suggestions first submitted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Britain and France were transmitted by the Holy See. The Pope's peace activities take two forms: one is to negotiate with the Italian government to persuade it to negotiate with Britain and France, and the other is to instruct the Secretary of State of the Vatican to instruct diplomatic representatives stationed in Britain and France to indicate to the governments of their respective countries, requesting them not to resolutely reject the Italian suggestions, but to find other ways to mediate, so as to make the Italian suggestions and the suggestions of the Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council mutually compatible. It is generally believed that this negotiation by the Holy See was put forward at the same time as the recent peace talks with Britain and France. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Sanctions Adjustment Committee to Reconvene Tomorrow, Britain Values League of Nations Action, Foreign Secretary Hoare to Personally Participate</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Sanctions Program Adjustment Committee is scheduled to meet on the 31st to determine the date for implementing economic sanctions against Italy. British Minister Without Portfolio Eden will arrive here on Wednesday to attend the meeting. Foreign Secretary Hoare will depart from London on Thursday afternoon. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval is scheduled to depart from Paris on Wednesday or Thursday evening. It is still unknown whether Italian Chief Representative Aloisi will also come here. If so, the negotiations currently underway between Britain, France, and Italy will apparently continue behind the scenes of the League of Nations. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Because the League of Nations Sanctions Adjustment Committee meeting starting on October 31 will make important decisions, British Foreign Secretary Hoare has decided to personally participate in the meeting. He is scheduled to depart for Geneva on Thursday morning and will stay approximately until November 3. However, this move does not indicate any change in British government policy. Minister Without Portfolio Eden is scheduled to depart for Geneva on Wednesday to participate in the first day of the Adjustment Committee meeting and will stay until the end of the meeting. When the Adjustment Committee adjourned last week, it requested each member state to notify the League of Nations Secretariat by October 28 of the plans taken or to be taken to implement sanctions against Italy. The replies from the governments will be delivered before the Adjustment Committee reconvenes, so the main task of the committee will now be to determine a common date for implementing the recommendation to prohibit the import of Italian goods.</p>
<p>In his speech in the House of Commons last Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Hoare said that he would use the time before the implementation of this recommendation to explore whether a mediation method could be found that is in line with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and acceptable to both Italy and Abyssinia. Since then, there has been a diplomatic exchange of views between Rome and Paris. Initially, the general public hoped that this effort could establish a basis for mediation, but this hope has gradually disappeared. It is almost foreseeable that the major powers in the League of Nations now have no other way than to implement the entire program drafted by the Sanctions Adjustment Committee in order to shorten the period of the Italian-Abyssinian war and bring about an early peace agreement. Therefore, the decision of the British Foreign Secretary to personally go to Geneva is not because there has been any change in the British government's opinion, but because it attaches importance to the actions of the League of Nations.

<h3>China's Reply to Sanctions Against Italy Announced, Majority of Members Have Accepted, Japan Takes Wait-and-See Approach and Decides Not to Reply</h3>

The reply was announced today, stating that China has implemented a blockade of military supplies to Italy, has no conditions for implementing financial sanctions against Italy, and also stated that China has never prohibited the shipment of military supplies to Abyssinia, so there is no need to cancel the ban on Abyssinia.

<p>(Tokyo) On the 22nd of this month, the League of Nations, in the name of the Chairman of the Sanctions Committee, issued a note to the Japanese government regarding the League of Nations' attitude towards sanctions against Italy to inquire about the Japanese government's attitude. However, the Japanese government not only has no political obligation to assist the League of Nations, but its relationship with Italy is different from that of the League of Nations member states, so a careful review is also required regarding expressing its attitude. It is learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated its attitude on the 29th as follows: It is indeed a fact that the League of Nations has always used this form of notification to the Japanese government. Following precedents, it has been decided not to give any reply to Chairman Bar's notification this time, but to adopt a silent attitude. (29th Japan United Telegram)</p>

However, well-informed sources believe that the Argentine government is currently considering implementing sanctions against Italy, so the trade agreement may not be concluded immediately.

<h3>US Adopts Supernational Attitude Towards Italy-Abyssinia Dispute Hull Reiterates Previous Remarks</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement reiterating his repeated statements since the beginning of the Italy-Abyssinia dispute, stating that the US government's policy towards the Italy-Abyssinia issue is completely supernational in nature and has not been affected by any compromise with any foreign country.

<h3>Italy's Response to Sanctions Leans Towards Anti-Capitalism Various Raw Materials Converted to State-Run, Cash Reserves Currently Still Sufficient</h3>
<p>(Rome) The League of Nations is about to set a date for the implementation of economic sanctions, and the result will likely be that Fascism will tend towards anti-capitalism. This can be seen from the Italian government's recent implementation of the state-run system for items such as coal, copper, tin, nickel, and engine oil. Currently, Italy has implemented a kind of "dictatorship system" for various raw materials, and a large number of orders will soon be promulgated to restrict various economic activities that can still be freely operated, making them state-run. As for financial sanctions, they have already been implemented in practice. Since the second half of August, most merchants in Britain and even the United States have already cancelled credit accounts for Italy. Some foreign exporters only allow short-term accommodation for Italian importers, and even have a payment deadline of 24 hours, which is equivalent to buying goods with cash. However, Italy's cash reserves are currently still above 4 billion lire, so financial circles believe that Italy will not find it difficult to cope with the sanctions. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Speeches by British Party Leaders, Election Campaign Begins, Baldwin Disapproves of Blockade Against Italy, MacDonald Advocates Armed Maintenance of Peace, Eden Praises League of Nations' Vigor</h3>
<p>(London) The British election campaign began actively yesterday. New Labour Party leader Attlee, Privy Councillor MacDonald, Cabinet Minister Eden, Health Minister Wood, and Indian Affairs Minister Zetland all gave speeches. Prime Minister Baldwin began his election campaign in Wolverhampton yesterday, mentioning the danger of adopting a blockade action for future sanctions against Italy, saying that without the sympathetic assistance of the United States, Germany, and Japan, he would never approve of Britain having a blockade action. In the past two or three months, peace has no longer been a matter of Xuan Tan, but has become a reality for individuals of all ages. The difficulty the world encounters now is nothing more than whether international disputes should be resolved by force, or whether they can be resolved by law like private disputes. There can only be one answer to this question. The British people cannot isolate themselves from the world to resolve this major event. The effort to cooperate for peace is not a virtual dream, nor is it absurd martial arts, but solid common sense. The Prime Minister then spoke of the need to repair military preparations to make up for the gaps in national defense, saying that in terms of military preparations, Britain does not have the problem of vigorously expanding its military preparations. All we want is to replace the warships built before the war with new ships. If the British Isles are isolated from the public and do not participate in world affairs, then Britain will inevitably become an armed military camp. The founders of the League of Nations deeply knew that if the League of Nations was not assisted by anyone, then the war would not be able to be localized, and the plan to stop the war between the two countries would not be implemented. The result would be a world war. Baldwin later mentioned domestic mining disputes, saying that the government hoped to obtain special responsibility from the mine owners within a few days to establish a business marketing agency before July 1 next year. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Privy Councillor MacDonald, who insisted on peace during the European War, announced today that he also agreed with Prime Minister Baldwin's policy of advocating increased British naval and army preparations. This statement was issued by MacDonald at a speech at the Caxton Hall today. He said that Italy's attack on Abyssinia has made him believe that to maintain peace treaties, force must be used as a backing. "If Britain's defenses are inadequate, then in the current stage of world evolution, it will not only be insufficient to contribute to peace, but it can also become a source of war. The security treaties that we painstakingly created in Geneva will be destroyed by the actions of one or two aggressor countries, then we can only return to the days of competing armaments with alliances in the past, which will eventually lead to war," he said. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Cabinet Minister Without Portfolio Eden said in a speech somewhere last night that Britain's support for the League of Nations plan is unprecedented in its determination and greatness. This is because the general public deeply believes that only through the League of Nations can there be hope of creating a new world order. For this reason, no country is now trying to use force as an instrument of its national policy. Those who say that Britain's actions in the League of Nations during the current Italy-Abyssinia dispute have been too slow are actually ignorant of the truth. The actions of the League of Nations in the past few weeks can be called a truly consolidated group and deeply understand international responsibility. If they think of how difficult the work of the League of Nations is, they will praise the League of Nations' vigor. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Labour Party member Attlee said in his broadcast speech that the two real issues in the current general election are the safety of avoiding war and the safety of living methods. The Labour Party firmly believes that the world must disarm and unite into a collective security system. The government's support for the League of Nations is completely new. They have never wholeheartedly maintained the League of Nations, but have always looked after the policies of pre-war imperialism and alliances. War starts from the economic system, and there must be economic cooperation to bring the invention of science to the benefit of the people of the world. Attlee spoke of domestic affairs, saying that the government has adopted the economic theories of madmen, intending to raise prices and harm the country. We must know that we are now living in a new world and must adapt to our special circumstances here. The institutions of industry and commerce today are extremely complicated and must not be entrusted to private enterprises to listen to their pursuit of profit. We must work hard to create the Britain we want to have. If the Labour Party gets the opportunity, it will immediately start with large-scale plans, but current difficulties must also be dealt with. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Independent Labour Party (an extreme left-wing group, different from the Labour Party in Parliament) issued a declaration today, accusing the British government, calling it preparing for war in the Mediterranean "to protect imperial interests," and also criticizing the Parliamentary Labour Party for supporting sanctions against Italy. (28th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>A total of 1,295 candidates for members of Parliament have now been nominated by various parties, including 59 women, who will compete for seats in the general election next month. It is estimated that there are 5578 candidates representing the government and 738 candidates from the opposition parties, including 540 from the Labour Party, 175 from the Liberal Party, three from the Independent Liberal Party, and two from the Communist Party. Many constituencies are still searching for candidates. Former Prime Minister Lloyd George and former Finance Minister Snowden are both broadcast spokespersons for the opposition Liberal Party. From this, it can be seen that these two are now supporters of Liberal Party leader Samuel to oppose the government. (29th Reuters News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain Sends More Troops to Consolidate Egyptian Defenses</h3>
<p>Alexandria A British transport ship arrived here today from Malta, carrying 1,000 British troops. There are also three transport ships carrying 2,000 troops from India. It is learned that the transfer of these troops here is to consolidate Egyptian defenses. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Cairo According to inquiries from this agency's correspondent, the Egyptian government has recently taken appropriate measures to prevent unexpected incidents that may occur during tense diplomatic situations. Yesterday was the anniversary of the Italian Fascist Party's March on Rome, so the authorities were especially vigilant. The Ministry of the Interior has also started investigating the occupations and addresses of Italian expatriates. At the same time, the Italian Consulate in Cairo has prohibited expatriates from holding any public demonstrations that could disrupt the peace and order. Furthermore, when ships carrying Italian troops and military equipment to Italian Eritrea moor in Cairo, the Egyptian government collects dock fees. The Italian government has repeatedly requested an exemption, and according to well-informed sources, the Egyptian government will reject this request. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Italian Army Advances on Both North and South Routes, Occupies 20,000 Square Miles, Abyssinia Concentrates Elite Troops to Prepare for Counterattack, Musa Ali Area Becomes Major Battlefield</h3>
<p>Italian Army Northern Front Italian northern route troops are urgently awaiting orders today, preparing for the second time to move forward. Currently, Italian troops have occupied 25,000 square miles of Abyssinian territory, and Abyssinian chieftains are still surrendering to Italy, so although there has been no war in recent days, the occupied area is still increasing day by day. (28th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government recently issued Public Notice No. 31, stating that the Abyssinian army on the southern route has collapsed near the towns of Hirraffa and Gola Hei in the Ogaden area, while the front line in the Tigray province on the northern route is completely quiet. Italian troops are currently advancing from the city of Aksum towards the city of Mek'ele. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital Most of the troops here have recently departed for the Ogaden area to join the war. It is heard that General Saium on the northern front is preparing to join forces with General Gazzera to attack the Italian army positions north of the city of Mek'ele. (29th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital Abyssinian military leaders recently held a meeting at the defense line in the Musa Ali area. It is generally expected that the battle will take place near the area. It is also heard that General Getachew intends to lead a million elite troops to launch a general attack on the Italian army positions in early November. Therefore, General Getachew has recently traveled from the city of Dessie to Musaria to command the military throughout the area. General Getachew recently explained the special strategy he has adopted, saying that "four Abyssinian soldiers should share one rifle. If one soldier dies, the second soldier will immediately take up the rifle to fight, and if the second soldier dies, the third and fourth soldiers will follow." He also said that "as long as the enemy is in Abyssinian territory for one day, there will be no possibility of a peaceful resolution. In two months, I do not believe that even one Italian soldier will be able to stand in Abyssinian territory." In addition, it is generally believed that the Abyssinian crown prince is currently leading his troops in Dessie to resist the enemy, expressing his willingness to command the battle on the front lines, and will not return to the capital even if summoned by the Abyssinian emperor.

<h3>Southern Route Italian Army Pressures Abyssinian Army Positions, Aircraft Bombing Sassabaneh, Abyssinian Army Assembles at Gola Hei to Prepare for Resistance</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to news from the front in Mogadishu, although the weather continues to rain, the troops in Italian Somaliland are still advancing. Aircraft are now bombing Sassabaneh, other small villages, one hundred and sixty kilometers northwest of Gola Hei town, along the main route from Jigjiga to Harar, and the small village of Daga Bur, 30 kilometers from Sassabaneh, are also being bombed by Italian aircraft. From the situation of the air force's activities there, it can be seen that the Italian column departing from Walwal is taking Sabana as its destination. As for the main force led by General Graziani, it is advancing along the Webi Shabelle River. The colonial department here expressed its opinion, saying that the offensive taken by the Italian army along the Webi Shabelle River is a diversionary tactic. The main pressure of the Italian army will be on the Abyssinian army positions north of Sassabaneh and Jigjiga. If the military action there succeeds, then the town of Gola Hei will be indefensible and easy to capture. According to the Abyssinian army, a large force is concentrated in the town of Gola Hei for the purpose of preventing the Italian army from passing from there to the Fafan River. It is expected that Italian aircraft will soon bomb the city of Harar, because the troops in the Abyssinian inland are successively departing from Harar to the front. If the city of Harar is bombed, it will be difficult for the Abyssinian army to transfer troops. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news received here today, the Italian army in northern Abyssinia is now waiting for orders to attack Mek'ele, 65 miles southeast of Adwa, but the Italian aircraft on the southern front are now carrying out aerial strikes again. One team of Italian aircraft fiercely bombed Abyssinian soldiers gathered in Magals with bombs. The Abyssinian soldiers responded with anti-aircraft guns. According to the Italian aircraft, they silenced the anti-aircraft guns. The bombs caused multiple fires. The aircraft then safely flew back to their base. At the same time, the Italian government decided to restrict meat or fish to only one dish starting on November 5. The government also ordered that all report paper envelopes, newspapers, and magazines must be reduced to the smallest extent possible. However, the authorities have not yet implemented a rationing system. It is heard that Mussolini declared at a Fascist Party meeting today that he did not want to restrict the sale of bread and grains. It is now believed that the Italian government will announce a ban on the entry of goods from countries that have implemented economic sanctions against Italy. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Northern Route Actively Arranges Defense Line, Rushing to Build Roads to Facilitate Military Transport</h3>
<p>Tigray Province Front Italian troops recently dispatched from the Andesi-O front line, the purpose of which is to protect the security of the Italian army's left wing, and at the same time to consolidate the camp of the right wing. It is generally believed that in the near future, as soon as the defense line is fully deployed, the light cavalry team will be concentrated on the front line, and when the construction of the road between the front line and the rear is completed and military supplies can be freely transported, the Italian army will completely adopt the strategy of colonial war, because this strategy has greater power. It is also heard that hundreds of natives in the Andesi-O area have joined the Italian army, willing to take on road construction or military work. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Tigray Province Front According to this agency's military reporter, Bahl, today is the 13th anniversary of the Italian Fascist Party's March on Rome. Celebrations were held throughout Eritrea and all Italian-occupied areas. The highway from the port of Massawa to Toga-Mel was officially opened at the same time. According to reports, the road is an important place from the Red Sea to the Abyssinian mainland. Without this road, it would be almost impossible for the Italian army to march. The road is 130 kilometers long, and some places are 2,400 meters above sea level. The climate is extremely hot and the temperature in the shade reaches 60 degrees Celsius. The road construction project began on November 10 last year and employed 10,000 white workers and 30,000 native workers. The number of workers who died during road construction was 220 white workers and 300 native workers. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Erecting Anti-Aircraft Guns in the Capital of Albania to Defend Against Air Raids</h3>
<p>Tirana: Anti-aircraft guns have been erected here today to prepare for Italian aircraft bombing from the north and southeast. According to a government statement, the Italian claim that a large number of Albanian chieftains have surrendered is entirely false. The names of the chieftains announced by Italy are all fabricated. A high-ranking official told an Associated Press reporter that if the war is prolonged and the army suffers heavy losses, the Albanian King might cede some territory. However, doing so at present would be tantamount to the Albanian King cutting his own throat. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Committee Discusses Report on Japanese Mandated Territories</h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Makes Every Effort to Argue Against Revising Current Economic Treatment</p>
<p>(Geneva) Whether Japan, after withdrawing from the League of Nations, should enjoy the same economic rights as League member states within the League's mandated territories has been discussed by the League of Nations Mandates Commission today. The Japanese representative, Minister to Poland Ito, attended the committee meeting and submitted his government's report on the administrative status of the Pacific island territories under Japanese mandate. Ito repeatedly stated that Japan would never agree to revise the current economic treatment within the mandated territories and that the mandated territories were allocated by the Allied and Associated Powers and co-belligerents in the Ambassador's Conference during the Great War and are not within the scope of the League of Nations. Furthermore, during the meeting of the Mandates Commission last year, representatives of several countries pointed out that Japan was spending a large amount of administrative expenses in the South Pacific mandated territories and was not obtaining any commercial benefits, indicating that they were mostly of a military nature and contrary to the treaty on the mandated territories system. It is reported that Ito will submit a report tonight to defend against this. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Mandates Commission continued its meeting today to discuss Japan's report on the administrative status of the Pacific island territories under mandate. The issue of establishing military defenses on these islands was raised. After repeated explanations by the Japanese representative, Minister to Poland Ito, the committee members were satisfied and accepted the report without further debate. The committee then decided to refer the question of whether non-League member states should enjoy equal economic rights within the mandated territories, along with the official statement of the Japanese representative Ito, to the League of Nations Council for decision.

<h3>Collapse of Puppet Mongolian Conference – Tense Relations Between Japan and Russia – Request by Puppet for Establishment of Border Commission Rejected by Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Relations between Soviet Russia and Japan have become tense again today. It has been announced that negotiations between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia on general issues have broken down. A dispatch from Kulun from the government's communication agency states that the Manchu side's request for Mongolia to accept a commission of three representatives to discuss border disputes has been rejected by Mongolia. It is believed here that both Manchuria and Mongolia are in reality vassals of Japan and Russia, so this matter will ultimately be handled by Moscow and Tokyo. Soviet officials insist that the Manchu side's proposal to establish a commission is part of a Japanese-Manchu plan to invade Mongolia and seize Mongolian livestock, furs, and other commerce. Official telegrams received here state that the Mongolian authorities are very surprised by "Manchukuo's" attitude because such an attitude will not only fail to help negotiations but will also harm existing relations. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) News from Kulun states that negotiations between Manchuria and Mongolia are currently being held at Manchuli Station regarding the establishment of a border commission to resolve border disputes. On the 21st of this month, Mongolian Chief Representative Yuan Sangbu visited Manchu Representative Yu Ji (transliteration, a Japanese person) and submitted the following note from the Mongolian side: "Negotiations between Manchuria and Mongolia have improved significantly this year in August. However, currently, the 'Manchu State' government is repeatedly adopting the kind of ultimate methods that cannot lead to a friendly resolution of the problem and cause unnecessary changes in the relations between the two countries. The Mongolian government expresses deep regret over this. The Manchu side, in the form of an ultimatum, demanded that the Mongolian side accept its proposal to send representatives to three locations (including Kulun) and refused to consider the Mongolian side's suggestions that are consistent with the purpose of the negotiations. This kind of attitude cannot but surprise the Mongolian government. Regarding the mediation of border disputes, the Mongolian side suggests a method of establishing primary committees in Manchuli and Tamsak-Bulak, one of which is responsible for handling disputes from the northernmost section of the Manchurian-Mongolian border to the Kherlen River, and is organized by one representative of Mongolia stationed in Manchuli and one equivalent representative of the Manchu authorities. The other one is organized by one representative of the Manchu side stationed in Tamsak-Bulak and one equivalent representative of the Mongolian side, and its task is to handle incidents that occur in other parts of the Manchurian-Mongolian border. These two preliminary committees will have ample opportunities to resolve all issues of the Manchurian-Mongolian border in a timely manner and on-site. According to the Mongolian suggestion, if the preliminary committees for border disputes also cannot resolve them, they will be submitted to the mixed border commission for handling. The mixed commission is composed of representatives from both sides, and its task is to make final resolutions on various issues in accordance with the orders of their respective governments. From this point of view, the Mongolian suggestion is consistent with the task of negotiations between the governments of the two countries, and can resolve border disputes quickly and in a friendly manner in a simple and appropriate way. The Mongolian government believes that people with full authority, if they have formal powers, must be able to quickly resolve these issues, and representatives should be appointed. The Mongolian government believes that there is no sufficient reason for the Manchu side's suggestion that representatives should be stationed at Hailar and Bain-Tumen, because the Mongolian side's method can resolve disputes in each section of the border through the preliminary committees in Tamsak-Bulak and Manchuli. As for the claim that more permanent agencies should be established in Kulun and Changchun, there is even less reason for this, because the above-mentioned two places are far from the border, and they will not directly resolve border disputes."</p>
<p>The Mongolian note concluded by saying, "The Mongolian government hopes that when the Manchu side raises issues, it can abandon its attitude of not focusing on the issues themselves, and can make a correct assessment of the factual convenience of the Mongolian suggestion. If the Manchu delegation can present its arguments and hopes with an attitude of focusing on the issues themselves, in order to establish an agreement that can be accepted by both sides, and that can truly guarantee the peace and tranquility of the Manchurian-Mongolian border, then the Mongolian government will definitely consider it seriously as in the past."

<h3>Selection of Japanese Delegation to Attend Naval Conference – Nagano and Nagai Appointed as Plenipotentiaries</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to send plenipotentiaries to the naval disarmament conference that will begin in London on December 2nd. The personnel have been determined to be Admiral Osami Nagano of the Navy Ministry and Ambassador to Germany Matsuzo Nagai, who is replacing Ambassador to France Sato, originally appointed by the Foreign Ministry, due to his inability to leave France. Today's cabinet meeting decided that the expenses for the Japanese delegation will be 580,000 yuan, to be paid from the second reserve fund. (China United Press, 29th)</p>
<h3>Italy Demands Internationalization of the Strait of Gibraltar – Testing the Waters with Britain Before the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored here that Italy advocates that traffic from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea should adopt the same system as traffic from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. In other words, the Strait of Gibraltar should be regarded as the same as the Suez Canal. Therefore, Italy will propose the internationalization of the Strait of Gibraltar at the upcoming naval conference. This rumor is intended to test the waters and will soon be denied. British officials say that the upcoming naval conference is particularly technical in nature. If Italy wants to raise political issues in the parliament, it will be resolutely opposed by Britain. If Italy insists, it will only lead the conference into a stalemate. It is generally believed that Japan has put forward the principle of "security equality" based on geographical reasons (i.e., all countries should have equal rights to enjoy the same security). It is unknown whether Italy will invoke Japan's claim to support its political demands. It is now reported that Britain and France will hold bilateral talks this week or early next week to prepare for the naval conference. It is expected that Britain will request the abolition of submarines. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Puppet State's Exchange Control Under Japanese Assistance</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The fundamental policy on currency between Japan and Manchuria has been agreed upon among Director-General Hoshino, Financial Advisor of the Kwantung Army Arakawa, and Vice-Minister of Finance Tsushima, and has been approved by Finance Minister Takahashi. The content is as follows: (1) The basic currency policy between Japan and Manchuria must comply with the economic development of "Manchukuo." (2) "Manchukuo" should maintain its national currency's credit independently through the progress of industrial policies and the improvement of its balance of international payments. (3) Unifying the currency of "Manchukuo" with the national currency is fundamental, and the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) and the military should cooperate to expand its scope of circulation. (4) Regarding the circulation of Korean banknotes within "Manchukuo," they should be used by the Bank of Korea as the exchange reserve of the Central Bank of Manchuria and gradually replaced with the national currency. (5) Foreign exchange management laws should be implemented within "Manchukuo" to prevent the flight of capital overseas and to suppress speculation. (6) The exchange rate between Japan and Manchuria will remain the same as it is now, but there is no need to set up an exchange equalization fund. (Dentsu, 9th)</p>
<h3>Rumor That U.S. Treasury Secretary Has Agreed to Prevent a Plunge in the Pound – Apparently Consistent with Silver Policy</h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored in London and Paris that the U.S. Treasury Secretary has agreed to prevent a plunge in the value of the British pound in order to help the Bank of France. This action appears to be consistent with the U.S. silver policy. Since Morgenthau met with officials from the Bank of France, it is reported that the United States has purchased 40 million ounces of silver in London, which is part of its silver policy. It is also reported that the U.S. Treasury Secretary has firmly stated to the Bank of France that there will be no further devaluation. If the above rumors are all true, then the London foreign exchange market will stabilize, as the United States is preventing the pound from falling, and the British equalization fund is preventing it from rising. There has been no dramatic fluctuation in the foreign exchange market to test the reliability of these rumors. However, it is generally expected that when the internal situation in France, which is currently overshadowed by diplomatic developments, is once again noticed, the franc will inevitably be attacked.

<h3>Spanish Cabinet Resigns En Masse Due to Casino Bribery Case</h3>

<h3>Guanyun Various Circles Appeal for the Speedy Opening of Baiqian and Other Dams</h3>
<p>To Avoid Water Congestion and Prevent the Collapse of the East Bank of the Yanhai River. The County Government Indulges the Landlords' Requests and Abandons the West Bank.</p>
<p>Guanyun correspondence. This year's Yellow River flooding has severely affected the Haishu area. The vicinity of Banpu has become a marshland. The Xinpu-Banpu highway is now several feet deep in water, and transportation relies entirely on shipping. Currently, various circles in Guanyun are firmly requesting the authorities to open the Liuli Baiqian and other dams to avoid water congestion and expansion of the disaster area. On the 24th of this month, another urgent telegram was sent to the provincial government, which is recorded as follows: "Most Urgent. Zhenjiang Provincial Government Chairman Chen, Civil Affairs Department Director Yu, Construction Department Director Shen, Provincial Party Department Gentlemen, This year's Yellow River flooding has already caused disasters on the west bank of the Yanhai River in Guanyun, with water depths varying from three, four, five, six, seven, to eight feet. Fields, houses, and graves have collapsed almost completely, and many people and livestock have also died. The water level is rising sharply day by day, and the east bank of the Yanhai River and the county seat are in imminent danger. It has been verified that during major floods, the people are allowed to freely open the Liuli Baitui Niudun Three Dams according to regulations. The water situation is extremely dangerous. Two-thirds of the Niudun and Liuli dams have been opened, but the Baiqian dam is completely blocked, causing water to become congested. The county seat is surrounded by water, and the Huaibei Salt Affairs Inspection Sub-Office and the Xinban highway are also several feet deep in water. Appeals have been made repeatedly to the Administrative Inspector of the East China Sea District and the Guanyun County Government to request the opening of the Liuli Baiqian Niudun Three Dams. The Commissioner granted permission and instructed to open the dams. However, Magistrate Xu Xiekuo went to the province on official business, and the section chief, at the request of the large landowners in the southeast, refused to open the Liuli and other dams, citing unwillingness to expand the disaster area, abandoned the west bank of the Yanhai River, protected the fertile land on the east bank, and built the Yanhai Dike to resist the flood. The construction of the Yanhai Dike is merely a waste of financial resources. It has been verified that water flows downward, and water control is based on dredging, and never on water storage. Moreover, the agricultural work on the east bank of the Yanhai River has been completed. Drawing water into the sea not only does not hinder anything but can also eliminate pests. If the water is congested for a long time, the east bank of the Yanhai River may also collapse. If a river is blocked, it will break, and many people will be injured. The sowing of wheat will be delayed indefinitely. In the future, the downward flow of fresh water will also affect the spring sweeping of the salt merchants, which will affect national taxes and the people's livelihood, which is by no means insignificant. In addition to sending a telegram separately, we are compelled to respectfully request your review and approval to order Magistrate Xu Xiekuo of Guanyun County to open the Liuli Baiqian Niudun Three Dams day and night, and also to order the opening of more channels to the sea to facilitate drainage and relieve the county. We are extremely anxious and await your orders."</p>
<h3>Liu Bingzhong Talks About the Engineering Situation and Water Conditions at Dongzhuang</h3>
<p>The Collapse and Water Seepage of the Geliang Does Not Affect the Breach Closing Project</p>
<p>Kaifeng correspondence. Liu Bingzhong, the inspection director of the Henan, Shandong, and Hebei Flood Control Office, went to inspect the water conditions and engineering situation in the Dongzhuang breach area and returned to Bian yesterday. According to his talk: (1) After the Jiangsu Dam, a new ramp should be built, although it is a direct hit, the river surface is wider, and the ramp has slowed down slightly. (3) Li Shengtun has built five sections of revetment, wing walls, and sweeping. Three sections have become submerged in the water. The first section has been protected with stone to level the slope. According to Director Zhang, the inner part can be built again after the completion of the more than 100-zhang revetment along the river. (4) The south end of the Geliang was scoured, eroded, seeped water, and collapsed into an opening, measuring 130-140 zhang wide. The length of the embankment at the south end where it connects to the levee is about 40 zhang, and the length of the embankment at the north end is estimated to be about 300 zhang. A total of 25 sections of straw sweeping have been built on the north end near the water seepage area. The work is still guarded by Yucheng adding compartments. Although the large surge directly injected into the sweeping section a few days ago, it flowed south along the sweeping and still poured out from under the dam of the sixth breach. Therefore, the water seeping out of Geliang is clear water without surge until before the retreat embankment. The deepest point along the levee is more than one meter, and the north end is about one or two inches. The people of the county are rushing to build a revetment in front of the embankment foot to prevent wind and waves. After eating the Geliang, the terrain of the north section is higher than the south section. Although the south section is seeping water, the direction of the surge has not moved north. This is also due to the nature of the downward-flowing water. Therefore, according to the current situation, although the Geliang has collapsed and seeps water, it has no effect on the breach closing project plan. (5) There are more than 1,600 cubic meters of stone material currently in stock, and stone-carrying boats are still arriving at the work site every day. There is very little straw material, and it is being urged to purchase. As for the dangerous works in the cold stockade area of the second and third sections in southern Hebei, they are no longer collapsing, and the situation is easing. (27th)</p>

He then changed to a car sent by the municipal government and returned directly to his private residence on Rue Cardinal Foch via the city center. He inspected the urban construction along the way. Mayor Wu and others also took cars to pay their respects. After returning to his residence, the Chairman summoned Mayor Wu to inquire about everything. He then received Deputy Chief Chen Xunyong of the Maritime Department and others and invited Dr. Lu Zhong'an to his residence for a diagnosis. Then, he went to the Sino-Western Sanatorium for a physical examination. According to the Chairman, "I returned to Fujian this time to visit the ancestral tombs and take the opportunity to inspect the educational situation in my hometown. Fujian Province is quite peaceful, but it has suffered a lot due to repeated typhoons, resulting in significant losses. Fortunately, the autumn harvest is abundant, and it will not be difficult to restore the original state. Although my old illness has not been cured, it is not a major problem. I plan to stay in Shanghai for two days to have a physical examination and take a train back to Nanjing on the morning of the 31st to attend the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee on November 1st."</p>
<h3>Cai Yuanpei and Others Go to Nanjing</h3>
<p>As the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee approaches, Central Committee members Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Ju Zheng, Tan Zhen, Zhang Fakui, and others took the night express train to Nanjing together at 11:00 PM last night.</p>
<h3>The Largest Bridge on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is Completed</h3>
<p>Contracted by Shanghai Dachang Company</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has a 1,700-foot steel bridge structure in the Liangjiadu area of Nanchang, with two railway tracks and two highway lanes on top. It is the first railway and highway combined bridge in China, completely designed and built by Chinese engineers. Construction began in November of last year and has now been fully completed. Trains can be run as soon as the railway is completely laid. The cost of the bridge is 860,000 yuan, and the contractor is the Shanghai Dachang Construction Company. Due to the extremely deep excavation of the piers, the company and the engineers of the railway bureau encountered various special engineering difficulties during the major flood in Jiangxi this year before the project was completed. The bridge project is entirely self-made by the Chinese people, and this bridge should be considered the beginning. The above picture is a photograph taken during the construction of the bridge.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province's Construction Public Bonds are Mortgaged to Shanghai Banks</h3>
<p>Half of the public bonds, 2.5 million, are used as collateral. Chen Zhongbi is Scheduled to Come to Shanghai in a Few Days to Continue Negotiations.</p>
<p>In order to develop industry, Guangdong Province is preparing to issue 5 million yuan in construction public bonds. They are now scheduled to be issued on December 1st of this year.

A Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that Chen Shenbi, the president of the Guangzhou Municipal Bank, is scheduled to come to Shanghai again in a few days to continue negotiations on mortgage loans with banking circles.

<h3>Special Commissioner from the Dutch East Indies Comes to China</h3>
<p>To Inspect the Chinese Sugar Industry</p>
<p>According to sources from the local overseas Chinese affairs agencies, the authorities in the Dutch East Indies have recently noted that the Chinese sugar market has been affected by Japanese sugar dumping and the restriction of the Guangdong sugar industry control, and that the foundation of sugar is shaken. If investigation and rectification are not carried out, the future is in danger. Therefore, the Dutch East Indies authorities have specially dispatched Tilale, a senior advisor to the Farmers' Bureau, and Wen Xihuang to come to Hong Kong on the Dutch ship "Zhenijiala". They will also bring products from the Dutch East Indies to China for exhibition. It is reported that Tilale and others will briefly inspect the sugar market conditions in Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shantou, and Xiamen before coming to Shanghai for inspection and will go to Nanjing to pay respects to our industrial authorities.</p>
<h3>Economic Inspection Delegation to Japan, Yu Tang, etc., Returned to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Daquan Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of Next Month</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Our country's economic inspection delegation to Japan has completed its inspection of industry and commerce in that country. Except for Chen Guangfu and others, who have already returned to China, yesterday, additional delegation members Yu Zuoting, Tang Shoumin, and four others, along with commissioner Qin Kai and seven others, returned to China aboard the Shanghai Maru. Prominent figures from the financial sector, such as Zhang Peishen, welcomed them at the pier. The delegation leader, Wu Daquan, and his party are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of next month. A detailed account of their arrival and conversations is provided below:</p>
<p>Returned to Shanghai Yesterday: Our country's economic inspection delegation to Japan, led by delegation leader Wu Daquan, crossed the sea to Japan on the 6th of this month. They landed in Nagasaki and proceeded to Kobe, Osaka, and other central industrial and commercial areas of Japan to visit various economic cooperatives in that country. After completing the group inspection schedule on the 23rd, each delegation member continued with independent visits. Delegation members Tang Shoumin, Yu Zuoting, Liu Hongsheng, Huang Wenzhi, commissioner Qin Kai, Li Zhishi, Li Beitao, secretary Zhou Xijing, Gu Jiemei, and ten others returned to China together yesterday aboard the Shanghai Maru, landing at the Huishan Wharf at approximately 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Welcome from Relatives and Friends: Those who went to the wharf to welcome them yesterday included approximately 50 people, including Zhang Peishen of the Bank of Communications, Zheng Chengqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yu Qiaqing of the Shipping Association, Xu Zhiyi of the China Merchants Bureau, He Molin, Chen Weiqing, and relatives and friends. As each delegation member disembarked, they shook hands and chatted happily with their relatives and friends. They then changed to cars and returned to their residences to rest.</p>
<p>Written Conversations: While on board, the reporter met with delegation member Yu Zuoting and inquired about the journey and his impressions. He presented the written conversations of the delegation members, stating that after the economic inspection delegation to Japan arrived in Japan, from Nagasaki, to Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya, and the two capitals, they received warm hospitality from the local industrial and commercial sectors. They exchanged opinions with a sincere attitude, all agreeing that Sino-Japanese amity requires mutual understanding to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. Mutual assistance leads to mutual benefit, and mutual benefit initiates amity. China is rich in natural resources and should base its nation on agriculture, forestry, and mining. Japan, through decades of effort, has become an industrial nation, aggressively competing in global commerce, but lacks raw materials and needs to rely on external supplies. Therefore, there is a relationship between China and Japan, and cooperation is necessary. However, cooperation should be based on equality and mutual specialization, and one-sided demands rarely succeed. During this inspection tour, banquets and discussions repeatedly conveyed this idea, which was well understood by the Japanese. However, a country is an entire organism, and the economy is the lifeline of the organism. All aspects of a country, including politics and military affairs, are related to the economy. Therefore, economic cooperation is essentially a comprehensive cooperation between the two countries. Merely talking about the economy is insufficient. It is hoped that people from both countries will enhance all aspects of their relationship through economic ties, so that this inspection will not have been in vain.</p>
<p>Yu's Impressions: Mr. Yu continued to describe his impressions of the trip, saying that he followed the entire delegation and visited famous places, and his reflections can be summarized in several points: 1. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has studied and imitated material civilization, and it seems to have entered a period of creation today. Judging from the progress, it should not be difficult to surpass European and American countries in the future. 2. The entire nation, whether officials or common people, shows the spirit of hard work and bearing heavy burdens like the Germans after the war. 3. The entire nation is diligent, thrifty, hardworking, and maintains the humility of the East, and education is widespread, making it easy to receive organized training. This is the reason why all industries and businesses in the country are well-organized. 4. Historical concepts are still deeply rooted in the people, and the government also protects them in many ways. Religious belief and material civilization are progressing simultaneously, which maintains much of the social morality and public sentiment and should not be ignored. As for initiating and organizing the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, it is based on the above-mentioned concepts, hoping to realize economic cooperation between China and Japan, similar to the established Sino-American Trade Association. Preparations for the association have already begun. As for other details, Delegation Leader Wu will provide a detailed report to the public upon his return to China in the coming days.</p>
<p>More Arrivals to Come: The delegation members currently still in Japan include delegation leader Wu Yuanquan, Zou Minchu, Zhou Zuomin, Huang Jiangquan, Zhong E, Shang Kui, Zhu Shugang, Secretary-General Liu Tiecheng, commissioners, and staff members. It is reported that they will return to China in batches. Delegation Leader Wu and others are scheduled to leave Japan on the Nagasaki Maru tomorrow (the 31st) and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 2nd of next month.</p>

They arrived in port on the President McKinley on Sunday and plan to board the President Grant to go to Manila.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Bankers Condemn Speculators, Hoping the Financial Authorities Will Strictly Ban Them</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The recent surge in gold prices has been brought under control after the Central Bank's efforts. The cause of this surge in the gold market was due to speculators. These individuals only care about their own interests and create rumors, causing the gold market to reach unprecedented levels. Chinese and foreign bankers in this city deeply condemn the behavior of these speculators, which disrupts the stability of the entire financial market, and hope that the financial authorities will strictly ban them in the future.</p>

<h3>Telephone Expert Committee Met Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussed the Contents of the Supplementary Report</p>
<p>After the final report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Telephone Expert Committee was submitted to the Bureau, it was presented at the public committee meeting the day before yesterday for review.

<h3>Chinese Ratepayers Association Publishes Opinions on Valuation and Collection of Rates; The Rent Valuation Committee Has No Legal Basis; Its Judgments Are Not Binding Externally</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession issued "Opinions on the Shanghai Municipal Council's Valuation and Collection of Municipal Rates", which stated, "According to the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang, the standard for calculating the Municipal Rates, commonly known as the police rates, can be based on the valuation agreed upon by the Council and the property owner. The reason why the regulations stipulated this way was to accommodate the actual situation at the time, that is, only those who owned and used their own property and did not rent it out. Although it has been revised many times, this provision remains the same. However, in practice, for a time, the Council still conducted rent valuation and rate collection for rented houses, but it was the same as the current land valuation, which was often below the actual rent. Therefore, rate collectors often manipulated things to sacrifice public revenue to enrich their own pockets. Subsequently, the Council's move to increase the rate was met with opposition, and this kind of shady deal gradually became clear. In order to increase revenue, the actual rent was used as the standard for rate collection. Therefore, rate collectors must present rent receipts to new residents when collecting rates. If there are any fabrications, in addition to checking the landlord's accounts, they will also sue in court. There have been precedents to follow. Since then, the Council's practice of using the actual rent as the basis for rates on rented houses has become a strong convention, and it is in line with facts and principles. Therefore, this convention can occur, and public opinion is unanimous without any objection. The above-mentioned estimation behavior of the regulations can only be applied to those who own and use their own property. In 1927, the Council increased the rate from 14% to 16%, which was met with strong opposition. Although it was still paid under protest, it was reduced by two percentage points after the sale of the Electricity Department in 1929. Since then, the Council has repeatedly sought to increase it, but it has not dared to implement it due to the decline in the local economy and mixed public opinion. Therefore, it wanted to use the rent valuation method, which had become a dead letter, to increase rate revenue in fact. For example, if the rent is 100 yuan, the monthly rate should be 14 yuan based on a 14% rate. If the valuation is increased to 150 yuan, the rate must be 21 yuan. The rest can be deduced by analogy. The rate has not increased, but the rate has increased by one and a half times, which is equivalent to increasing the rate from 14% to 21%. The Council also thought that this plan would be considered too arbitrary, so it claimed that it was convenient for taxpayers to appeal and set up the so-called 'Rent Valuation Committee'. Its purpose was to be like the 'Property Committee', both of which are public decision-making bodies, so that their judgments are equivalent to the final judgment of the court. In fact, the organization, personnel selection, and election method of the Property Committee are stipulated in the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang. The Committee has no legal basis, and its establishment is only approved by the Board of Directors as a consulting body for the Finance Committee. The Committee itself has no legal basis, and its judgments have no binding force. Taxpayers are allowed to arbitrarily increase the rate of Municipal Rate Collection by the Council, originally because any change in the rate must be agreed upon by the taxpayers before it can be implemented. If the Council can arbitrarily increase the rate for those who have actual rent to rely on, the Council can arbitrarily increase rate revenue at any time without obtaining the consent of the taxpayers. Then the taxpayer's control over the Council is completely lost, and the spiritual foundation of the Public Concession's Municipal Government is fundamentally shaken. Based on the above, the Association has always given serious opposition to the Council's valuation of the Municipal Rate Collection without regard to actual rent, and adheres to the following principles: (1) The Council should collect rates based on the actual rent for houses with actual rent, and may use rent valuation to collect rates for those who own and use their own property. (2) The Council's establishment of the so-called Rent Valuation Committee has no legal basis and does not recognize its right to hear lawsuits according to law. Its judgments have absolutely no external binding force. (3) The Council shall not arbitrarily increase rate revenue. Unless the taxpayers agree to change the rate, the taxpayers have the absolute right to refuse to pay the Council's extra-legal rate revenue. Gold Exchange Notice: Sellers Must Pay Special Security Deposits."</p>
<h3>Although Gold Market Prices Are Stable, Jia Tai Gold Shop Closes</h3>
<p>Gold Exchange Notice: Sellers Must Pay Special Security Deposits</p>
<p>(Huadong News Agency) Since several brokerage firms, such as Xie Da Xiang on the 23rd of this month and Yuan Kang Xiang on the 25th, temporarily closed due to margin issues, brokers have been wary of large-scale trading. On the afternoon of the 28th, Jia Tai Broker No. 133 was also closed due to a margin issue. The Gold Exchange issued Notice No. 2108 yesterday morning, stating that Jia Tai Gold Shop's margin has not been cleared and should be temporarily suspended from business. Afterwards, the Huadong News Agency reporter investigated from all parties and learned that the shop was established four years ago with a capital of more than 60,000 yuan. It was a limited shareholder company with a manager named Lu. The current debt is about 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Sellers Pay Additional Special Security Deposits</p>
<p>Previously, due to extraordinary market fluctuations, a special security deposit of 50 yuan per bar was collected from buyers, which was implemented from the 27th. Yesterday, Notice No. 2106 was issued, stating that due to extraordinary market fluctuations, gold trading in the Exchange will, in accordance with the provisions of Article 42, Paragraph 2 of the Exchange's Business Rules, require sellers to pay additional special security deposits of 50 yuan per silver coin from today onwards.</p>
<p>Brand Name Guarantee Requires Prepayment of Security Deposits</p>
<p>Another Notice No. 2107 stated that gold shops using brand names to guarantee shares and using them as security deposits in the Exchange will, due to extraordinary market fluctuations, be required to prepay security deposits if purchases and sales exceed 70 bars or more before they can increase trading. According to the Huadong News Agency reporter, the security deposit is 100 yuan for each bar traded to maintain the system.</p>
<h3>American Press Leader Howard Went to Nanking Last Night</h3>
<p>American press leader Howard, who recently came to China from the United States for sightseeing and stayed in Shanghai for many days, went to Nanking by train last night accompanied by Dong Xian Guang to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, President Wang Jingwei, Secretary-General Ye Chucang, and others. It is reported that Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Li Dijun and President of the Central News Agency Xiao Tongzi will host a banquet in Nanking this afternoon to entertain Howard and invite Secretary-General Ye, Vice Ministers Xu and Tang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and American reporters stationed in Nanking to accompany him.</p>
<h3>American Asian Airline to Launch Next Month</h3>
<p>Hong Kong as the Final Stop Not Yet Confirmed</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) United Airlines of America has been planning to develop Far East transportation and open the American Asian Airline for a long time, and it is scheduled to launch next month. Its starting point is San Francisco in the United States, and the final destination in Asia was originally planned to land in Hong Kong. However, the reciprocal conditions with the British government have not been agreed upon. Later, it was planned to directly reach Guangzhou, but our country did not approve it due to sovereignty relations. Finally, it was agreed with Portugal to take Macau as the final destination, and it was scheduled to launch the San Francisco to Manila section next month. As for Manila to Macau, due to business relations, it is feared that the losses will be too great, so it is temporarily postponed. Recently, it was heard that the United Kingdom and the United States have recently signed an aviation agreement. The United Kingdom has allowed Hong Kong to be the final stop of the line, and the United States has granted the Atlantic aviation rights in exchange. The reporter inquired with the United Airlines Company in this city yesterday, and it was said that they had not heard of this news. The various rumors are probably not true. The vice president, Mr. Bixby, is still in the Philippines and is expected to come to Shanghai next month. In short, due to business relations, the American Philippines section will be launched first.</p>

Previously, in accordance with Article 6 of the revised Factory Registration Rules of the Ministry of Industries, a stamp tax of two jiao was required for factory registration certificates. Now, the bureau, based on an instruction from the Municipal Government, relayed a communication from the Ministry of Industries stating, "In accordance with the revised Article 6 of the Factory Registration Rules of the new Stamp Tax Law of the Ministry of Finance, the stamp tax has been changed to one yuan, and the matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and record, and notices have been sent to other departments for their information." Therefore, the bureau has issued an order to the Social Affairs Bureau to announce the correction. Furthermore, factories that have already been approved for registration do not need to re-register. The details are listed below, and the original text of the bureau's announcement is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Social Announcement: The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced, "According to Instruction No. 16057 from the Municipal Government on October 28, 'According to Communication No. 13681 from the Ministry of Industries, "The revised Factory Registration Rules and the form of the registration certificate were previously communicated to your Municipal Government for reference and implementation. Article 6 of the rules stipulates that a stamp tax of two jiao is required for the registration certificate. The reason for this tax rate is that the spirit of factory registration lies in the submission of the two types of registration forms, A and B, in Article 3 of the rules, so as to understand their business operations and exercise supervisory powers. The function of the certificate is only to prove that the factory has been registered, so as to avoid the penalties of Article 11 of the rules. It is completely different from the licenses of company registration and the certificates of business registration, which are used to obtain rights. There is no specific provision for the tax rate for stamp tax in the various categories of Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax. Therefore, it is handled by analogy to Article 3, Category 21, "Application for Certificate of Naturalization," which is set at two jiao. Now that the Stamp Tax Law has been formulated and promulgated and ordered to be implemented from September 1935, Article 16 of the law, which is attached to the tax rate table 35, does not contain the certificate and similar certificates. Tax rules, resulting in the tax rate of the previous factory registration certificate, no basis, after all, can the certificate be exempted from using stamp tax? Regarding the tax rules, after consulting the Ministry of Finance Yecheng, 'Check the Stamp Tax Law, the various licenses and certificates related to the business that should pay stamp tax, is to distinguish whether to levy donations and taxes, in the tax rate table brother thirty-one section backup questions, industry is detailed in the record, the factory registration and the company registration and business registration, the matter is the same, and its registration and registration certificates, etc., are only charged the certificate fee, and are not issued in accordance with the levy of taxes and donations, this factory registration certificate, according to law, should be affixed with stamps, (and so on, should be in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Stamp Tax Law, Tax Rate Table 32, the original factory registration certificate of the fixed stamp tax of two corners, changed to one yuan, in addition to the factory registration rules Article 6 amended, changed to stamp tax of one yuan, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and record, and issued separately, corresponding to the investigation, transfer order to comply with, to the various places before receiving this amendment tax rate official documents, all the factories that have been registered to receive the certificate, still affixed according to the original tax rate, no longer affixed, so as to avoid confusion, and hope to check and order to know the lotus, etc.准准此、合行令仰該局即便知照、等因奉此、合亟布吿、仰本市各工廠一體周知、自二十九日起、登記憑單之印花稅、應遵照部令、改貼一元、連憑單費一元、共為二元、此布</p>
<p>Receiving the certificate.</p>
<p>Also, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired and learned that factories in this city that have been approved for registration in accordance with the Factory Registration Rules in the past only need to pay the certificate fee and stamp tax to the local competent authority to receive the certificate in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the revised Factory Registration Rules of the Ministry of Industries. There is no need to re-register, so you can go to the Social Affairs Bureau to pay the certificate fee and stamp tax to receive the certificate again, without having to re-register.</p>

In other words, each relief fund of one yuan must be paid to the victims after the re-examination of the investigator of the association, and no one else should be used. It is expected that the future will be able to achieve rapid and agile results, and there will be no obstacles.

<h3>Sun Fucai Plots to Frame His Brother-in-Law, Disregarding the Destruction of His Mother's Corpse, Reports to the Police That His Brother-in-Law Killed His Mother, the Exquisite Armor is a Knife Wound</h3>
<p>Sun Fucai from Ningbo, aged [ ], also known as Chu Jiu, came to Shanghai with his mother, Jin, aged 58, on September 11 and stayed at his brother-in-law Xin Xingkuan's place in Ningbo at No. 89 Mike Tor Road, looking for business. Recently, his mother was frightened and became ill, lying in bed. Xin was working as a clerk in Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. His income was not high, and he had a large family, which was not enough to cover expenses, so he could not afford to hire a doctor to treat his mother-in-law's illness. He sought the help of gods and Buddhas, only asking for immortal prescriptions to drink. Sun Fucai was very dissatisfied. Unexpectedly, his mother died at 5 pm the day before yesterday. Sun happened to be out and did not return until 8 pm. Seeing that his mother had closed her eyes and was sleeping soundly, he felt extremely resentful and came up with a plan to add to Xin Xingkuan's experience of prison. He took advantage of the gap to use a small knife to stab a hole in the right abdomen of his mother's body, and secretly went to Dongxi Huade to throw the knife into a river. He went to the Hongkou Police Station to report that his mother was stabbed in the abdomen by his brother-in-law Xin Xingkuan and died, requesting justice. The police chief sent Detective Zhu Jihuang and Detective Bai Mingfu to secretly investigate and learned that Sun had accumulated resentment and made false accusations. He was detained and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the previous situation and said that Sun had admitted it in the police station.

When questioned, Sun's confession was hesitant. Judge Jiang ruled that he should be detained and rescheduled for review. And Sun Jin's body was clearly dissected by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang. The knife wound was stabbed after death. After Prosecutor Guo Wei lived in the office, he obtained the dead Sun Jin, female, who died of illness before her death. Sun Chu Jiu has been prosecuted by the police and should be sent to court for investigation. The body was handed over to his daughter Xin Sun for a settlement to be taken back for burial.</p>
<h3>Creditors of the Hong Kong National Bank's Shanghai Branch Petition to Declare the Shanghai Branch Bankrupt, Petitioner Liang Botang is Given a Deadline to Submit a Power of Attorney, the Respondent Claims That the Assets and Liabilities are Sufficient to Pay Off</h3>
<p>The head office of the Hong Kong National Bank is located in Hong Kong and is registered with the British government, while the Shanghai branch is also located on Jiangxi Road. In August of this year, the Hong Kong head office ceased operations, and the Shanghai branch was also ordered to announce its cessation of operations on September 16. At the same time, the shareholders' meeting and the creditors' meeting of the Hong Kong head office recommended Lu Zhongqing, Ma Huibi, and Ma Antu as liquidators of the Shanghai branch, and the Ministry of Finance also approved the creditors' request and appointed Lu Zhongqing as the supervisor and liquidator of the Shanghai branch. Recently, Liang Botang, the chairman of the creditors' group of the Hong Kong National Bank's Shanghai branch, hired a lawyer to petition the Shanghai branch of the bank to be declared bankrupt in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Bankruptcy Law, "If the debtor stops payment, it is presumed that it is unable to pay" and Articles 2 and 58 of the same law and the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Guanjin opened the 13th Court for summons. Lu Zhongqing, the legal representative of the respondent, hired lawyer Huang Zongdong to appear in court to defend, and raised a preliminary issue, saying that whether the creditors' group was indeed entrusted by the creditors, if it could not enter these two proofs, the court should dismiss the petitioner's petition. The petitioner's lawyer immediately replied that Liang Botang was the standing committee member and chairman elected by the creditors' meeting, authorized by the creditors, but there was no power of attorney, but it could be corrected according to law. The court ruled that the power of attorney should be submitted to the court within two days, otherwise the petition would be dismissed. Then, the petitioner's lawyer stated the reasons for the petition, saying that the creditor of the Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong National Bank requested the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to investigate its legal person status from the British Consulate. Then, Director Yu replied that the British Consul considered that the bank was opened by Chinese joint venture and registered with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and should be considered a Chinese legal person, and Lu Zhongqing was the manager of the Shanghai branch and was an interested party with the bank. According to the law, he could not be a liquidator. Now that he could not pay, he asked to declare him bankrupt according to the bankruptcy law. According to Huang Zongdong's lawyer, although the Shanghai branch of the Hong Kong National Bank was registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, foreigners can register with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce when operating businesses in Jiangsu. It is presumed that it is indeed a Chinese legal person. According to the Bankruptcy Law, the main business place must be located, and the main business place of the respondent is in Hong Kong, and Shanghai is only a branch. As for Lu Zhongqing's election as a liquidator, it was elected by the shareholders' meeting and the creditors' meeting, which fully complied with the provisions of the Company Law, and the assets of the Shanghai branch, in addition to the profit-making assets, exceeded the amount of liabilities, which was not the inability to pay debts as defined by the Bankruptcy Law. It should be rejected in accordance with the provisions of Article 63 of the Bankruptcy Law. The petitioner's petition was rejected, and the accountant's asset-liability report, account books, and registration certificate of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce were submitted to the case for inspection. Judge Jiang checked the report and ordered both parties to withdraw and await the ruling.</p>

<h3>The Words "Robber" are Tattooed on the Face, the Tattooing Case is Judged, Zhang Guoqing is Sentenced to Two Years and Six Months</h3>
<p>During the half night on the 2nd of September in the Bao Fan Workshop opened by Zhang Guoqing, a native of Yangzhou, at No. 36 of No. 46 Jian, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, a thief, Teng Shunzi (also a native of Yangzhou), took advantage of the opportunity to break in and attempt to steal. Zhang Guoqing noticed and captured Teng, and together with his friends Wang Dacheng and Wang Maojun, used a rope to tie Teng to a pillar and subjected him to tattooing. He used a long needle to tattoo the words "Robber" on the left side of Teng's face and applied blue ink. Then, he released him. Teng suffered this lifelong humiliation and could not accept it. He reported the incident to the police and arrested Zhang Guoqing, Wang Dacheng, and Wang Maojun together with Teng Shunzi and sent them to the local court.

<h3>Zhang Xinying Establishes the Far East Library, Accused of Fraud; the Envelope's Upper Corner is Printed with a Magnificent Building; It's the New Building of the Guohua Bank on Henan Road; Many Deceived People are Reporting to the Police</h3>
<p>Zhang Xinying, from Lianzhou, originally worked as a manager at a certain dance hall. Suddenly, at No. 66 Mou'er Road, she rented a vacant house to establish the Far East Library, soliciting business by sending out a flood of letters to various locations both locally and abroad. After receiving remittances from people to purchase books, Zhang would embezzle the funds without sending the books. People then realized she was using a false name to defraud them, and they sent letters to the General Inspectorate to report her. The detective chief dispatched Gao Xian'gen, a detective from the Political Department, to work with Ding Huaguo, a detective from the relevant Xin Zha district police station, to conduct a thorough investigation and collect the original letters she had sent. Upon inspection, they determined that Zhang was indeed intentionally committing fraud. On the upper corner of the front of the envelopes used by the Far East Library, she had printed a magnificent building, claiming it was the library's address, while the back featured a system chart of the library's internal organization, with no fewer than ten departments, including a novel editing department, a magazine editing department, and an English translation department. Each department was labeled with a telephone number. This exaggerated technique was designed to mislead people into believing the library was sound and grand. In reality, the image of the library's address was the building of the Guohua Bank on Henan Road, and the so-called internal organization was purely fabricated. The two detectives returned to investigate a few days ago and found that Zhang had moved the Far East Library's sign to No. 7, Lane 161, Baike Road. They inquired with the sub-landlord of the house, who said that Zhang had only rented a front wing room, and upon inspecting the books for sale inside, they found only a few volumes. This further convinced them that she was running a fake bookstore to swindle money without a doubt. Therefore, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Concession, filed a lawsuit against Zhang Xinying in the First Special District Court on charges of fraud. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui held a hearing, but the defendant did not appear. A lawyer appeared on her behalf, saying that the defendant had gone to Hangzhou and had not returned, and requested a postponement. Judge Liu then ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for Thursday.</p>
<h3>Strange Hat-Snatching Case: Zhang Danjie, Does He Have Special Tendencies? Song Daniu's Intentions Are Revealed by His Words</h3>
<p>The Public Concession police yesterday morning at 9:30 escorted the suspect, Song Daniu, a 21-year-old from Anhui, to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, requesting detention in accordance with Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Zhang Tianyin, the Public Concession police's lawyer, rose and stated the reasons for the detention, saying that at 8:30 last night, Constable No. 12 of the Public Concession police was on duty at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Tiantong Road when he suddenly heard loud shouts from the Yizhong, a public cemetery, of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall behind the court. He went to investigate and saw a crowd gathered. The person being petitioned in this case was standing to the side, and an elderly man was lying on a rickshaw, appearing to be seriously injured. The constable questioned the elderly man, who said his name was Zhang Danjie, 52 years old, and that Song Daniu had snatched his hat and pushed him over during the ensuing argument, injuring his buttocks. Consequently, Song, Zhang, were taken to the police station. Zhang was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and the doctor found that Zhang's injuries were quite severe, with a fractured pelvis, so he was kept in the hospital for treatment. However, the suspect, Song Daniu, said something completely different at the police station, saying that he knew Zhang Danjie because he was a hawker selling spiced beans at the rooftop garden of the New World Company, and Zhang would come to play there, so they knew each other. Two weeks ago, Zhang invited Song to leave the New World Company and go to the China Hotel on Zhejiang Road, where Zhang opened a room and asked Song to perform a homosexual act, after which Zhang gave Song one yuan. Last night, they met again at the New World Company, and Zhang again invited Song to go to the China Hotel for more fun, but when they reached the entrance of the hotel, Zhang suddenly didn't want to go inside and wanted to find a more secluded path, so they went to the Yizhong area on North Zhejiang Road, intending to make Song do something immoral. Song refused, leading to an argument, and Zhang was pushed to the ground, etc. The police said that the statements of the two parties conflicted, and they did not have time to investigate in detail, so they requested that Song be detained, and the doctor should examine Zhang to see if he had such characteristics. When questioned, Song Daniu said, "He asked me to commit sodomy once and would give me one yuan. Last night, he invited me to the Yizhong, Zhang touched my lower part with his hand, kissed my face, and hugged me. I threw him down, causing him to fall to the ground," etc. Judge Liu Yugui examined the statements and ordered Song to be detained for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Death by Moldy Cigarettes Case: Judge Inspects the Tobacco Shop, Considers Self-Inflicted Injury Impossible; Deceased's Family Sues for Living Expenses</h3>
<p>Lu Bingkui, a Hangzhou native who worked as a wind instrument player, lived at No. 493 Guangdong Road. On the morning of the 16th of this month at 7:00 AM, he went to the Ruichangxiang cigarette and paper shop at No. 64 Beihai Road to buy a pack of Ding Ding brand cigarettes. He found that they had mold spots and took them back to exchange them, but Jiang Huai, the shop assistant from Wuxi, denied that the cigarettes were sold by his shop, leading to an argument and a scuffle. They were then separated by a man with a long face. However, at 11:00 AM, Chen suddenly experienced severe abdominal pain, believing it was caused by Jiang's beating, and immediately sent someone to reason with him. Jiang reported it to the police, accusing Chen of extortion, and they were both taken to the Lao Zha police station. Chinese Detective Chief Zhang Yuanqing and Bao Detective Xu Dezhong sent Chen to Renji Hospital for treatment. At 8:15 PM, Chen died despite treatment. The police then charged Jiang with the crime of causing death by injury. The First Special Court had already held one hearing, but because an on-site inspection was necessary, it was rescheduled. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Feng Shide opened the First Criminal Court to continue the hearing. Regarding the defendant's claim that the deceased had injured himself by bumping into a protruding corner of the counter, the inspection revealed that it was impossible. Based on this, the defendant was questioned, but Jiang insisted that the deceased had injured himself. The deceased's wife, Chen Zhu, hired lawyer Yu Bing to appear in court and filed a civil suit, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay a one-time payment of 3,000 yuan for living expenses and 500 yuan for funeral expenses, as she had a 70-year-old great-aunt and young children to support, all of whom depended on the deceased for survival. After further arguments between the police lawyer Wang Yaotang and the defendant's lawyer, Judge Feng announced the conclusion and scheduled the verdict for Thursday morning.</p>
<h3>Plagued by Poverty and Illness, Fortune Teller Ran Zi Ran; Stabbed Himself in the Chest with a Sharp Knife; Fatally Wounded and Died</h3>
<p>Ling Mingyue, a 47-year-old from Anhui, currently residing on the mezzanine floor of No. 240 Xin Xin Li, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, had been unemployed for a long time and now made a living by setting up a fortune-telling stall. His wife, Ling Ye, 42 years old, lived with her maternal family at No. 108 in the same lane. They had two sons, the elder of whom had come of age and joined the army, but had been missing for many years with no news. The younger son was still an infant. Ling suffered from stomach pain, which led to a smoking addiction. His stomach pain would recur intermittently. Recently, due to economic pressure, his old illness often recurred, and he had no money for treatment, leading him to have suicidal thoughts. At 11:30 PM on the 28th, taking advantage of the fact that a certain Jia, a fruit vendor who lived with him on the mezzanine, was asleep, Ling took Jia's three-inch-long sharp knife used for cutting fruit and stabbed himself in the chest. Blood gushed out, and he fell to the ground. Jia was awakened by a noise in his sleep and was shocked to see Ling lying in a pool of blood. He called out to his neighbors and urgently reported it to the Central Police Station. An ambulance arrived and took Ling to Guangci Hospital, but because the wound was fatal, he died after two hours despite treatment. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for autopsy. At noon that day, prosecutor Wang Ren from the Second Special Court, along with forensic doctor Wei and clerk Peng, arrived at the scene. They determined that the deceased had died from a knife wound sustained before death. Guan Ju questioned Ling's wife, Ling Ye, and then ordered the body to be released to her for funeral arrangements.</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Rectify Local Bands; Municipal Government Announces Measures to Ban Disorderly Performances</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government previously believed that the music played by local bands was indistinguishable between joyful and mourning tunes, and was disorderly and chaotic, with joyful music played at funerals, or light and frivolous music played at solemn and grand commemorative ceremonies. This not only violated the meaning of the music, but was also inappropriate and ridiculous. Therefore, the "Measures for Banning Disorderly Performances by Shanghai Bands" were specifically formulated and approved by the Municipal Government at its recent 391st Municipal Affairs Meeting according to the review opinions. Yesterday, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau was specifically instructed to implement them. The reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency reports the banning measures as follows: "Measures for Banning Disorderly Performances by Shanghai Bands" Article 1: All bands in this city that are for commercial purposes shall abide by these measures. Article 2: The bands mentioned in these measures refer to bands that use brass instruments.

Article 4: No band in this city shall use music scores that have not been reviewed and approved. Article 5: When hired, all bands in this city shall play appropriate music based on the nature of the ceremony being held, and shall not play joyful music at funerals or be disorderly and chaotic. They shall also listen to the instructions of inspectors or supervisors. Article 6: Any band in this city that violates the provisions of Article 3 shall be subject to a fine of up to 20 yuan. Article 7: Any band in this city that violates the provisions of Article 4 or Article 5 of these measures may have its registration certificate revoked. Article 8: Any band in this city that operates without registering with the Social Affairs Bureau, or any registered band that violates the provisions of these measures and continues to operate after its registration certificate has been revoked, shall be subject to a fine of up to 20 yuan for each offense. Article 9: After the registration certificate of any band in this city has been revoked, the Social Affairs Bureau shall promptly notify the Public Security Bureau of the band's name and address, instructing them to be aware.

<h3>Six Buddhist Organizations Solicit Opinions on Casting a Giant Bell; Dispatch Li Jingxu and Shen Hanfu to Survey the Mountain; Models of the Giant Bell and Bell Tower Begin to Be Displayed</h3>
<p>Six organizations in this port, including the Buddhist Laymen's Forest, Buddhist Bookstore, Buddhist Pure Land Society, Chinese Buddhist Association, Jiuhua Buddhist Association, and Shanghai Buddhist Association, have launched a campaign to cast a giant Far Eastern bell. According to the news from the bell preparation office, it has officially begun. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resurveying the Mountain</p>
<p>The bell preparation office also sent the monk Juechun to Jiuhua Mountain to select a base on the peak. According to the monk's letter, he has selected several scenic locations on Lanluan Mountain. He requested that personnel be sent to the mountain to survey and purchase one for the construction of the bell tower. After receiving the letter, the preparation office dispatched preparation committee members Li Jingwei and Shen Binhan to the mountain to select a site the night before last.</p>
<p>Spectacular Models</p>
<p>The bell is specified to weigh 18,000 kilograms and be cast from pure copper, engraved with the entire Ksitigarbha Sutra, and named the "Underworld Bell." Two models have been cast by Shen Yuanji Foundry in this port. One model, which is quite spectacular, is currently on display at the Buddhist Laymen's Forest. A model of the bell tower has also been made, divided into three floors, which is particularly elegant and solemn. It has also begun to be displayed at the Laymen's Forest.</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions</p>
<p>In order to solicit opinions on casting the bell, the preparation office has issued a notice stating: "The casting of the Jiuhua Mountain Underworld Bell is imminent. However, the materials to be used are still difficult to determine. Some say to mix seven parts of purple copper with three parts of brass. Some say to buy old sounding copper and recast it, which is not only cheaper, but also more reliable in terms of sound. Some say to mix copper and iron, which produces a better sound than copper. There are many ways to cast the bell and use materials. It is impossible to decide which is the most appropriate. This matter is important and must be carefully considered. Which material is the most suitable, and how should it be combined to achieve the purpose of a loud and far-reaching sound, so that it does not fail the original intention of casting the bell this time? We hope that you will not hesitate to teach us and provide detailed guidance."</p>

<p>The salary dispute of the employees of the Shanghai National Products Company was previously resolved by the court auctioning goods to compensate, and a judgment was made to execute it on the 21st of this month. Later, due to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce intervening to mediate, the auction was allowed to be postponed.

<h3>White Lotus Creek Port – Lao Gongmao Shipyard Fire</h3>
<p>At the Lao Gongmao Shipyard, a Chinese-owned factory in the White Lotus Creek Port of Pudong, a fire broke out at 7:30 yesterday morning.  The fire started in the cold working area, where workers were using tools on a wooden structure with a lead sheet roof. When flames were noticed, desperate attempts were made to extinguish the fire, but these were ineffective, causing the fire to spread uncontrollably. The factory immediately sent urgent telegrams to various fire departments requesting assistance.  Director Zhao of the Pudong District Fire Brigade quickly arrived on the scene with his team in fire engines to assist in the rescue efforts. By this time, the fire was burning fiercely. Two small boats owned by the factory were located under the shed, one named "Jixing," which was being repaired in a dock, and another which was old and unusable. Both boats caught fire simultaneously. As the hulls were mostly made of wood, they were easily combustible. Although several water hoses were used to extinguish the blaze, the boats were completely destroyed. Fortunately, firefighters were able to protect the interior of the cold working area. The fire was completely extinguished after two hours.  A wooden shed with an area of fifteen square fathoms and two small boats were destroyed, with losses estimated at over five thousand yuan. According to Mr. Ren, the person in charge of the factory, the fire was caused by a short circuit due to the factory's electrical wiring, which had not been replaced for many years. Turning off the electricity meter was not sufficient to stop the fire. Officer Ju Dai Baoqing of the White Lotus Creek branch police station inspected the scene and prepared a report to be submitted to the Tangqiao police station for forwarding to the General Bureau for review.</p>
<h3>Ding Fubao Serves Those Suffering from Lung Disease</h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao suffered from lung disease in his early years. Therefore, since his youth, he has been researching methods for treating and recuperating from lung disease and continues to do so. In recent times, the number of people suffering from lung disease has increased daily, and patients often go untreated, mostly due to a lack of awareness of early treatment or improper treatment methods. With his own experience and research, Mr. Ding is eager to provide free guidance to patients or their families. Patients can visit the Medical Bookstore at 204 Meibaige Road, Shanghai (across from Jin Chun Li) every morning. No consultation fee will be charged.

<h3>Traveler at Tianyuan Inn Attempts Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, Wu Luqing, a 26-year-old man from Shaoxing who was staying in room number 8 of the Tianyuan Inn at number 78 Xiamen Road, attempted suicide by ingesting raw opium. Wu, who was a Huqin (Chinese violin) salesman, had been suffering from business downturns, sudden setbacks, and extreme financial difficulties. A waiter discovered him and reported it to the Zhabei police station, which dispatched Chinese Constable No. 336 to the scene. An ambulance rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Dispute over the Transfer of Ownership of the Daguangming Shoe Store - Creditors Unable to Recover Debts - Wang Youcai and Others Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>The Daguangming Shoe Store at 216 Guangxi Road, owned by Wang Youcai from Zhenjiang, has accumulated a significant amount of debt for goods. When creditors demanded payment, Wang repeatedly issued postdated checks as a delaying tactic. Xu Youchun, Xu Hengfu, Cai Xiangsheng, Huang Wushi, and others filed lawsuits in the First Special District Local Court one after another because they could not get the money when the checks matured, and they requested the seizure of the shoe store. Last week, the court dispatched personnel to seal the store, but they still could not obtain the money. The creditors suspected that Wang and others were committing fraud together and requested that the court investigate and prosecute them according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court held a hearing. Only Xu Youchun appeared as the plaintiff, stating that the Daguangming Shoe Store owed him more than 2,060 yuan for goods. After filing a lawsuit with the civil court, the defendant, Wang Youcai, hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to publish a notice calling for a transfer of ownership and to represent him in the liquidation. At that time, Xu Youchun entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to Huang Xiubo, expressing his objection, but Huang ignored it. When he obtained a court order and went to seize the store, Lu Shaoshan suddenly appeared to prevent it, claiming that he had taken over the store. This was clearly a case of joint fraud. The defendant, Huang Xiubo, filed a countersuit against the plaintiff, accusing him of false accusation. Judge Zhan adjourned the hearing to a later date because three other plaintiffs, including Xu Hengfu, had not appeared in court.</p>
<h3>Xu Eying's Marriage Dissolution Case – Unilateral Argument Concluded</h3>
<p>Xu Eying, a 21-year-old woman from Suzhou, whose original surname was Sun and whose father, Sun Kejian, was a doctor, went with her family to Hankou in 1932, where her father ran his business and they lived at 5 Eryi Street in Hankou. In November of that year, her mother arranged for her to change her surname to that of her maternal family, and Chai Hailou acted as a matchmaker, betrothing her to Zhu Qingxi, a young man from the same hometown and the son of her mother's close friend. At the time of the engagement, Zhu's mother had already passed away, but the marriage had been agreed upon by Zhu's mother during her lifetime. The groom's family sent betrothal gifts and jewelry to the bride's family to formalize the engagement. Now, Sun Eying believes that this marriage was arranged by her mother in her early years without her consent, which is a matter of lifelong happiness. Therefore, she asked the groom's family to dissolve the engagement, but the conditions were not right, and the matter could not be resolved. The woman currently lives in Hankou, while Zhu lives at 3 Yongqing Lane, Juji Da Road, in the French Concession of Shanghai. According to the civil procedure law, based on the principle of jurisdiction over the defendant's place of residence, she first filed a petition with the Second Special Court to mediate the dissolution of the engagement, but it was unsuccessful. Therefore, she hired lawyer Wang Shijia to represent her and formally filed a lawsuit against Zhu in the Special Court, requesting a judgment confirming the invalidity of the engagement. After repeated summonses, the defendant had moved and could not be reached. The plaintiff requested a public notice, which was approved. Yesterday, after the expiration of the public notice period, Judge Li Liang heard the case in the Civil Court No. 7. The defendant still did not appear. The plaintiff, Xu Eying, was represented by lawyer Wang Shizong, who stated the grounds for the lawsuit and the purpose of the request for judgment. The court examined the evidence and letters submitted by the plaintiff. Afterwards, the court allowed the plaintiff to present her argument unilaterally and announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the judgment for 3:00 PM on the 31st.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have read the "Dispute over a Student Being Driven Away and Breaking His Leg" in the news column of this newspaper on the 28th of this month. The content is inconsistent with the facts. The child did not enter the platform without permission and tried to climb the coal platform. When he saw someone, he panicked and ran away, lost his balance, and was injured. The stationmaster and the police reported the incident at the time. I am afraid that the rumor will be passed on, causing the truth to be lost and harming my reputation. I respectfully request that you correct the mistake. Sincerely, Hua Guohun, October 29, 1935.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>"Patience" is acceptable, but do not take the road of "submission."</p>
<p>In the turbulent modern era of the twentieth century, we certainly cannot endure in the style of "drying ourselves while sleeping." However, we must not imitate Jesus by offering the left cheek after being slapped on the right, because that is not patience; that is an expression of extreme weakness, that is, a complete act of submission.</p>
<p>"Patience" must have its proper limits; it has a temporal and spatial nature. In other words, patience is by no means a passive invasion. Rather, it is a deeper understanding, followed by temporary endurance. But by no means should patience erode your inherent perseverance.</p>
<h3>The End of a Wrong Path</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>On this day, a young man with elegant clothes and a haggard face was added to cell number so-and-so. Because his demeanor was unlike that of a vicious thief, all the prisoners in the cell gave him a surprised look, as if welcoming this fair-skinned new comrade. The young man dragged his student's shackles, changed into prison clothes, and his facial expressions were constantly changing, sometimes ashamed, sometimes alarmed, sometimes resentful, and finally he slumped down.</p>
<p>The cell was not very bright, and the air had a strange smell, which made him very uncomfortable. However, when he thought about the fact that he had to live here for two years, he had to make the best of it. At this time, an older prisoner came over to greet him:</p>
<p>"Hey! Brother, what rule did you break to get sent in here? You don't seem like one of us! Can you tell us what happened?"</p>
<p>When the young man heard this question, tears welled up in his eyes, and he choked out the words:</p>
<p>"Alas! It's my fault, I took the wrong path. I deserve it, I deserve it! I used to manage accounts at a certain bank, and life was very comfortable. I accidentally went to a brothel with some friends and met a beautiful girl. After that, I was completely infatuated. I couldn't go a day without seeing her. My limited money couldn't win her favor. She was a famous prostitute. I was truly too blinded. Last month, I stole more than 13,000 yuan from the bank and hid in her courtyard. I only enjoyed myself for eight days before I was discovered. More than 12,000 yuan of the stolen money was recovered by the bank, and I was sentenced to two years in prison. That's why I'm here. It's my fault, I deserve it. I just feel sorry for my old mother at home, I don't know how heartbroken she will be..."</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent.</p>
<h3>Female Guide</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I went to a friend's club to chat, but everyone felt very bored. My friend said: "Recently, someone started a business that can meet the needs of lonely people. Let's try it." As he spoke, he got up to make a phone call.</p>
<p>Not long after, a robust woman suddenly came into our club, smiling broadly, and sat down, asking us: "Do you like to travel? Shop? Sightsee? Tour scenic spots? Please tell me what kind of guidance you need." She was experienced and serious, and she spoke to us in the local dialect without any shyness or frivolousness.</p>
<p>We didn't want to sightsee or shop, but because we were curious, we talked to her about random things. Only then did we learn that the mission of the guiding staff was: (1) To accompany people who are new to Shanghai and unfamiliar with the area on tours. (2) To assist Chinese and foreign visitors passing through Shanghai who want to see the sights by providing experienced Shanghai guides. (3) To accompany guests on tours of the many scenic spots and historical sites in Shanghai, a major metropolis in East Asia. Oh! We understood that they were all experienced hands.</p>
<p>We thought that people who have lived in the city for a long time probably know the general outline of the city and don't need to ask for advice. However, the dark side of the city is really not very clear. This is where we need to consult the old hands, but I don't know if they would be willing to guide us?</p>
<p>We have legal counsel to protect our lives and property; we have female guides for entertainment. It's really fun to live in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Nanhu Melody</h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>The water wind rustles the trees, such a peaceful lake has evening tides!</p>
<p>The white-haired old mother cherishes her strength, and must still carry passengers across the lake bridge.</p>
<p>My family's gentle oars are worth gold, the lake's reeds are my cold quilt.</p>
<p>I have anchored everywhere in the thirty-six bays, who wants to hear about my happy times?</p>
<p>The water products of Nanhu are very cheap, I peel them for the old restaurant until my fingers are sore.</p>
<p>I am used to seeing the water caltrop flowers bloom and wither, I am too unlucky to eat green caltrop!</p>
<p>I am most afraid of the sound of trees when the boat is moored, I cover myself with a bird awning and a straw raincoat.</p>
<p>All night long, the clear coldness and the white shadow of the waves, my sisters and I are Chang'e!</p>
<h3>Repentance Convent</h3>
<p>No need for prayer cushions or jade chimes, the old nun's work is in autumn silkworms.</p>
<p>Unprovoked, I extinguished the lotus lantern light, a handful of youthful silk is the beautiful little convent.</p>
<h3>Autumn Rain Meeting in Smoke and Rain Tower</h3>
<p>The leaning tower stands distinctly, the wooden boat and reed canopy float crampedly.</p>
<p>With tired feet, I listen to the heavens and am startled for half a lifetime!</p>
<p>The cold lake extinguishes the candle past mid-autumn; my teeth are tired of the old red shrimp,</p>
<p>How can my lungs bear the white dew? Thanks to the misty smoke for concealing the moon's outline,</p>
<p>The pure light is generously bestowed upon my old Confucian head!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: Struggling to Live, Watching a Cherished Grandson, Crying in Despair, Recalling the Famine Years, Planting Wheat Brings Disaster</p>
<p>Yueying said: "Later, he took my father to the army. In the fortress, there was another person who planted a lot of wheat, and he was also taken away. My grandmother, my mother, and I saw them taking people away and followed behind. Those soldiers first used their guns to stop us and prevent us from going. Later, the military officer said, 'It's okay to let them go and see,' so he let us go. People in the fortress were worried and followed us too. Unexpectedly, they took people away and, without asking many questions, they hung my father and the person from the fortress who went with him?" Mrs. Zhou said: "What do you mean by 'hanging'?" Yueying said: "It means tying people's hands and feet together and hanging them from the roof beam." Mrs. Zhou said, "So, the person is suspended in the air. How can they bear that?" Yueying said: "That's still good. Usually when they hang people, they use leather whips to beat them." Mrs. Zhou said: "Since you know about this, is it common in Gansu to whip people with leather whips?" Yueying said: "The county magistrate often tortures people to collect taxes." Mrs. Zhou said: "Then you don't take this kind of torture seriously anymore." Yueying was distressed. "Others just watch, but we, as family members, are terrified to see them hanging like that. We can only kneel on the ground and beg the military officer for mercy. They are truly iron-hearted. After they hung my father up, they only left four soldiers to guard the empty house. We knelt and begged, but they didn't hear or see us. It just so happened that two walls of the room where they were torturing my father collapsed, so we could see very clearly from the outside. My father's hands and feet were tied together behind his back, and his face was facing down. He was hanging on the beam like a thing being hung. At first, my father endured it without making a sound, but later he shouted for the commander to have mercy and save him. Then, he couldn't even shout for mercy, and his face changed from red to gray. All he could do was groan! My family, and the family of the person from the fortress who came with us, all knelt in the courtyard outside the house, crying together." (352)</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— Translated by Qin Shouou from the original work of Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>From where I stood near the Empress Dowager, I clearly saw her shoulders suddenly heave after listening to Li Lianying's words, almost as if she was about to jump up from her seat. I couldn't help but be startled as well. Although I knew that late autumn was not the season for magnolia blossoms, I did not understand what constituted an auspicious or ominous sign, so the Empress Dowager's great shock left me rather puzzled. Thus, I held my breath and listened attentively.</p>
<p>"What? Have those magnolia trees bloomed again?" the Empress Dowager asked with an uncharacteristic air of panic. "Quickly tell me the details! Tell me now! Quickly!"</p>
<p>"Reporting to the Empress Dowager! This humble servant would never dare to lie! It is all true! Just now, a gardener reported that there is indeed a magnolia flower that has bloomed..."</p>
<p>"Only one flower?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Your Majesty! It is said that it is on the oldest magnolia tree in the garden, and today a single, perfectly formed flower is in full bloom. This is truly a rare occurrence in ancient times, and there is no need for further explanation; everyone knows it is a sign of great fortune and auspiciousness!"</p>
<p>Li Lianying kept chanting "fortune" and "auspiciousness," but our Empress Dowager was already stunned. Her face instantly turned ashen, and she seemed to want to say something, but only her lips were seen opening and closing. After a moment, a sound was heard coming out. In those four or five minutes, her age seemed to have suddenly increased by ten years, like a thermometer rising. We could also clearly see that the five fingers of one hand she had pressed on her chest were trembling excessively due to the shock. However, aside from Li Lianying, none of us who served her understood the reason, let alone how to comfort her. We could only let her silently worry about the great disaster she believed was about to befall her. (448)</p>
<h3>"Big Chiming Clock" Without a Clock</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>"Big Chiming Clock" is the name of a tram stop in the French Concession of Shanghai, located between "Zhengjia Wood Bridge" and "Jixiang Street." Anyone who has been to Shanghai knows it.</p>
<p>As for why it is called "Big Chiming Clock," I think few people pay attention. As far as I know, it is because the central police station of the French Concession is located there, and the police station used to have a "Big Chiming Clock" on top of it. Therefore, the place was named "Big Chiming Clock."</p>
<p>However, the central police station there has now been rebuilt into a nine-story building, and there is no clock on top. Yet the place is still called "Big Chiming Clock." I think that in the long run, it may become like "Stealing Chicken Bridge," "Eight Immortals Bridge," "Dongxin Bridge," "Xixin Bridge," and "Zhengjia Wood Bridge" – a name that doesn't match the reality, leaving people confused! I record this for future reference.</p>
<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Talking About Crabs</h3>
<p>— Nangong Sheng</p>
<p>At this time, as early autumn arrives, the west wind begins to blow, the clear frost first falls, and maple leaves gradually turn red, it is the time when lake crabs are plump and full. Holding a crab claw and admiring chrysanthemums, peeling the shell and picking out the yolk, even an old diner's index finger moves. The crab stalls in the market are also becoming more and more prosperous. Crabs are an aquatic creature, delicious and rich in flavor, and they are produced in all seasons. However, the crabs in spring have not yet fully grown, and they are small and empty. Although they are plumper in summer, the season is short, and they are not very palatable. It is only when the mulberry leaves turn yellow and the west wind blows in late autumn that they become fat and large, with ample yolk and a fresh, rich flavor. In winter, the lake water freezes, and production is scarce, so the best time to eat crabs is now, in late autumn and early winter, when they are in season.</p>
<p>Crabs are divided into sand crabs and freshwater crabs. Sand crabs are produced in the sandy waters of rivers. Their taste is slightly salty and far inferior to freshwater crabs. Freshwater crabs are produced in freshwater, and their taste is sweet, rich, and delicious. They are the finest type of crab. They are produced in large quantities in the Jiangnan region, and the Yangcheng Lake in Zheng Yi is the most famous. Because the water of Yangcheng Lake is clear to the bottom, the crabs produced there are truly sweet freshwater crabs, and their taste is far superior to those produced elsewhere. Moreover, Yangcheng crabs have a unique characteristic: they have green backs, white bellies, golden claws, and red hairs, so they are called Golden Claw Yangcheng crabs. Besides Yangcheng crabs, crabs from Zhouzhuang and other places are also a type of freshwater crab. Although they are inferior to Yangcheng crabs, they are also a famous product. Sand crabs are produced in large quantities along the Yangtze River, but they are far inferior to Yangcheng Lake crabs.</p>
<p>The largest crabs seen in the market now are no bigger than a bowl. In the past, it was said that the largest crabs could grow to nine feet long and have white feet, called hundred-foot crabs, as recorded in the "Dongming Ji." During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, the Kingdom of Chunyuan presented a crab that was nine feet long, with a hundred claws, named the hundred-foot crab. There was also a crab that could carry a cart, which was even more magnificent than the hundred-foot crab. "The Ji Family's Book Collection" records a large crab from Haiyang that required a cart to carry, its size imaginable.</p>
<p>Crab is a general term. The female is commonly called "round navel" or "broad belt." The male is called "pointed navel" or "wave rake." According to "Guangya," "crab means 'kneeling'; the male is called 'wave rake,' the female 'broad belt.'" According to "Lu Kang's Crab Picture Record," there are twelve types of crabs in total. Kang ordered craftsmen to draw crab pictures, and there were twelve types: "one is 'youbang'," "two is 'paddle'," "three is 'sword holder'," "four is 'pengwei'," "five is 'jiepu'," "six is 'sand dog'," "seven is 'wangchao'," "eight is 'yiwang'," "nine is 'shiyan'," "ten is 'fengjiang'," "eleven is 'luhu'," and "twelve is 'pengqi'." Of these twelve crab names, only the twelfth, "pengqi," still exists today; the others have not been heard of.</p>
<p>There were also many strange stories about crabs in the past. The strangest is that they can drive away sore ghosts, as recorded in "Dream Stream Essays." There are no crabs in Guanzhong. Someone occasionally obtained a crab, feared its appearance, and thought it was a monster. When someone had sores, they would borrow it to guard the door, and often the sores would heal. Not only did people not recognize it, but ghosts also did not recognize it. This is truly an unheard-of strange thing. However, in the past, some people believed this to be true because they often thought that sores were caused by sore ghosts. Now that science is developed, everyone knows that sores are caused by microorganisms, and there is no such thing as ghosts. No one can believe that crabs can cure sores.</p>
<p>Although crab is a delicacy that everyone likes to eat, it is extremely cold in nature, and the crab shell is also dry. Eating too much is not beneficial. Therefore, when cooking crabs, perilla and ginger are often cooked together to dispel the coldness of the crab. Eating crab and persimmon together can be fatal, commonly known as "crab crawling intestines." In fact, both persimmon and crab are extremely cold. Eating them together at the same time can naturally cause illness, and it is not true that the crab in the stomach will actively crawl up the intestines!</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Textbooks Must Be Reviewed First</h3>
<p>Then Sent to the Ministry of Interior for Registration</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 29th Dispatch) The Ministry of Education instructs various departments that Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Copyright Law stipulates that the Ministry of Interior shall not register textbooks that should be reviewed by the Da Xue Yuan (National Academy) according to laws and regulations before they have been reviewed by the Da Xue Yuan. Therefore, textbooks used in schools at all levels should not be sent to the Ministry of Interior for registration before they have been reviewed by the former Da Xue Yuan or this Ministry. Recently, it has been discovered that many bookstores directly send textbooks that should be reviewed by this Ministry to the Ministry of Interior for registration, attempting to evade the review procedures, which is highly inappropriate. Hereafter, bookstores should send textbooks used in schools at all levels to this Ministry for review in accordance with the law and shall not attempt to evade the review, causing disorder in the procedures. The relevant departments are instructed to direct all bookstores to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Teachers' Union Appeals for Children in Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Elementary School Teachers' Union issued an appeal to all sectors of society regarding the children in disaster areas, stating: "China is afflicted by natural disasters, and calamities occur frequently. Last year's severe drought has barely subsided, and the wounds have not yet healed. Now, the severity of this autumn's floods is no less than that of the floods in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), and the scope is even wider. Almost all three major rivers in the country have experienced problems simultaneously, and the Yangtze and Yellow River basins have been the most severely affected. Due to the heavy rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the flooding of the Xiang River, the areas north of Hubei have largely become a watery land. Due to the torrential rains of the Yi and Luo Rivers, the Yellow River breached its banks in Henan and Shandong, and the disaster spread to northern Jiangsu. In total, the disaster has affected a vast area spanning sixteen provinces, and the number of victims is as high as twenty-five million. Some entire villages have been submerged, some entire counties have sunk, some have left their parents and wives and fled in all directions, and some have been unable to escape and have been buried in the bellies of fish. There are also families, old and young, who could not bear to be separated and tied themselves together with ropes and died together in the disaster. It can be said to be tragic. It is human nature to love life and hate death. If we were in their place, how could we not feel sorrow? The misfortune of children in disaster areas is particularly heartbreaking. Children are the lifeblood of the nation, rich in youth and with unlimited potential. However, due to their insufficient physical strength, they are unable to resist the invasion of floods. The number of those who drowned because they were unable to escape or who sacrificed themselves due to exhaustion during the escape is alarming. Those who have died are gone, and those who have survived are unable to attend school because schools have been closed, they have no place to live because houses have collapsed, they are separated from their parents and elders and have no one to rely on, or they are suffering from hunger and cold due to lack of food and clothing, or they are groaning in bed due to disease. After a major disaster, there is bound to be a major epidemic. Those who do not die from the water will die from disease. What could be more tragic than this? Everyone loves their children. The fathers and brothers in the disaster areas are not callous enough to sit idly by and watch their beloved children live in a state of displacement and hardship without thinking of ways to help. However, after surviving the disaster, their minds and bodies are exhausted. Although they have a compassionate heart for children, they lack the means to provide universal relief. We hope that people from all walks of life at home and abroad will follow the teachings of the ancient Confucian scholars who mourned for all mankind. If you close your eyes and think quietly, the plight of children in disaster areas will appear before your eyes. You should also have the Buddhist heart of saving all living beings, providing food, clothing, or money to help these victims and lead them to the shore of safety. First, provide life relief to prevent them from freezing and starving, and then provide educational relief to prevent them from dropping out of school. This is not only the fortune of children in disaster areas, but also the future of China depends on it. Furthermore, this year happens to be China's Children's Year. The government and the people are working together to improve the well-being of children across the country. The most unfortunate children in China at present are those in disaster areas. Therefore, the most urgent task of Children's Year is to seek happiness for children in disaster areas. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the success or failure of rescuing children in disaster areas is the success or failure of China's implementation of Children's Year. May all our compatriots strive for it."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Boy Scouts Review Yangzhong Township Division Achieving Excellent Results</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Boy Scout Review Camp concluded on the 28th. At 9 a.m., a memorial week was held in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters, chaired by Ling Shaozu, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters Committee. Ling Shaozu gave a report, and then the groundbreaking ceremony for the Provincial Council's new location was held. In the afternoon, the Boy Scout troops dismantled their camps. At 5 p.m., the closing ceremony was held at the Provincial Party Headquarters. Representatives from each Boy Scout troop participated. After Chairman Zhou Shaocheng delivered the closing remarks, Tang Changxun and others gave speeches. The speech by Chief Judge Li Qifan was the most insightful and sincere. He said that based on his personal conscience, he felt that the Boy Scouts were lacking in cooperation, were selfish in their service, and were irresponsible in their daily lives. He hoped that everyone would address these three major shortcomings and make further progress after a period of time. Then, Chief Executive Chen Bangcai presented awards.</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony After the memorial week, all the Boy Scouts were gathered at the site of the Provincial Boy Scout Council's new location for the groundbreaking ceremony. Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government went to Beijing on official business, so he was represented by Yu Jingtang, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. Ling Shaozu, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, represented the Provincial Party Headquarters. Chairman Zhou Shaocheng reported on the preparations for the Provincial Boy Scout Council's new location and decided to start construction within a month. Then, Yu Jingtang, the representative of the Provincial Government, personally held a shovel and erected the prefabricated stone tablet, and gave a speech, saying that the groundbreaking of the Provincial Boy Scout Council's new location showed the spirit of the Boy Scouts' efforts in fundraising, and also foreshadowed the future development of the Boy Scouts. He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard and persevere, and extend this effort in fundraising to general undertakings and promote it in the society, so that this glory would be further carried forward, not only for the outstanding achievements of the Boy Scouts in the future, but also as the foundation for the progress of the Provincial Party Affairs. Then, Ling Shaozu, the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, gave a speech. Finally, Director Yu issued awards to the three troops with the most art fundraising points: 59, 161, and Girls 33. The ceremony concluded with an announcement of adjournment.</p>

<h3>Overview of Recent Education in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Cheng Qibao, Director of the Education Department of Hubei Province, is determined to govern well. Since the last time he convened a meeting of domestic education experts in Hubei, he formulated an improvement plan based on the educational situation in the province for reference, and asked the experts to guide and determine the future direction of educational efforts. The following is a summary of the recent educational situation in the province after the summer of this year.</p>
<p>(A) Higher Education In addition to this year's 24th term of three government-funded students sent abroad (one to the United Kingdom to study fisheries, one to Austria to study police administration, and one to the United States to study agriculture), scholarship measures have been formulated for self-funded students studying abroad from the province to encourage them. The Education Department organized a review committee to review the documents submitted by the students and approved them. Scholarships will be provided from this year, and the Ministry of Education has been consulted and approved. There are six self-funded students studying in France and one self-funded student studying in the United States. The Ministry of Education has also revised the method of issuing tuition fees to government-funded students going abroad for the first time to enable students to concentrate on their studies and work hard. The first three months of government funding will be issued at the time of departure as stipulated. The government funding for the fourth, fifth, and sixth months will be remitted in advance in the early, mid, and late periods of the previous month. The government funding for the seventh, eighth, and ninth months will be remitted in advance in the early, mid, and late periods of the current month. (In the past, according to regulations, the fourth month's government funding had to be remitted together with the tuition fees for other government-funded students.) The government funding for the tenth month and thereafter will be remitted at the same time as the government funding for other government-funded students every month.</p>
<p>(B) Secondary Education In addition to holding education research conferences and competitions for secondary schools, teacher training schools, and various types of schools, and increasing the funding for assisting excellent private secondary schools this year, there are several plans for improving the teaching plans of secondary schools: (1) High schools should restore the elective system so that students can choose to study according to their interests. (2) Foreign language should be reduced in junior high schools to improve the level of Chinese and other subjects. (3) Teacher training school courses are numerous, and the time is often insufficient. The length of study should be extended by one year to allow students to receive sufficient training. (4) Teacher training schools have fewer teaching hours for common subjects than secondary schools. If the same textbooks are used, the time is insufficient. Textbooks should be compiled separately for application. (5) The plan to train high school graduates in teacher training schools for one year should be postponed until there is a shortage of teachers. (6-7) Omitted (8) Both physics and chemistry are subjects that study natural phenomena. Physics studies temporary phenomena, while chemistry studies permanent phenomena. Physics studies the shape of objects, while chemistry studies the quality of objects. Therefore, those who study the theory should start with physics first, identify its shape first, and then analyze its changes (characteristics). In the school system, chemistry is included in the second year and physics is included in the third year. This is originally upside down, and teaching is extremely difficult. It should be corrected immediately.</p>
<p>(C) Vocational Education The province has formulated an implementation plan for vocational education, which will be implemented starting this year. The general plan is to convert the Provincial Second Middle School into the Wuchang Commercial Vocational School, the Third Middle School into the Hanyang Industrial Vocational School, and add a Hubei Central Agricultural Vocational School. One junior agricultural vocational school is planned to be added in eastern Hubei, western Hubei, southern Hubei, and northern Hubei. The original vocational schools will be converted or add remedial classes that meet the needs. The vocational education funding will be increased by more than 86,000 yuan in the 24th year. After reducing two classes in each of the ordinary middle school, high school, and junior high school, the funding will be gradually increased according to the Ministry-set joint school funding standards.</p>
<p>(D) Elementary Education Because the province is vigorously implementing the Baojia system, in addition to instilling knowledge of rural organizations and self-defense and autonomy to rural children, the provincial government has stipulated that each county's Lianbao (joint guarantee) should establish elementary schools, implementing a system of integrating politics and education. Each county's Lianbao should establish one of the various types of schools (divided into primary elementary schools, simple elementary schools, short-term elementary schools, and mass schools) stipulated in the measures in the 24th year, and should be promoted year by year thereafter. If the province's Education Department implements the measures for county magistrates and district offices to bear considerable educational responsibility, then the province's education will not be difficult to popularize.</p>
<p>(E) Social Education The province has formulated the Hubei Province Literacy Education Program, which includes measures for the organization of mobilization agencies, the source of teachers, the implementation procedures, research and guidance funding, and local promotion assistance, which will be implemented in stages. Plans have also been made for the implementation of mass education in county and district units.</p>

<h3>Little Men (79)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Olcott of the United States, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Nan En didn't have time to think of any embellishments, but Xiaomei had already poured out the whole story, making Tai Fei unable to find a place to hide, so he could only hide his face in the bowl of milk and bread. After the story was over, Mr. Pei's eyes went straight to his wife at the end of the long table, his eyes full of smiles, saying:</p>
<p>"Dear, this matter is about your part, so I don't want to interfere with it."</p>
<p>Mrs. Shu knew what he meant, but she now loved her little black sheep even more, because she had such courage, but on the outside she only put on the most solemn expression and said:</p>
<p>"Do you know why Nan En was brought here?"</p>
<p>With his mouth full of food, Tai Fei muttered to himself, "Just trick me."</p>
<p>"She is here to help me make you all little gentlemen. I think you have shown it, and some of you need this very much."</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Tai Fei hid his face in his bowl again, and dared not raise his head again, until Xiao Qiao said a word, which made everyone laugh, because he said in his slow tone, expressing surprise:</p>
<p>"How can she be able to, she herself is like a man!"</p>
<p>"That's exactly why she needs help like you do, I hope you give her a good example of etiquette."</p>
<p>"Does she want to make a little gentleman too?" Robert asked.</p>
<p>"She wants to too; doesn't she, Nan En?" Tao Mo asked Nan En.</p>

<h3>On Eating Vegetarian</h3>
<p>— Yao Mu</p>
<p>Following the great popularity of Buddhism, the trend of eating vegetarian has also become extremely popular. From uneducated village women to high-ranking officials, once they have converted to the Buddha, they naturally become vegetarians. Vegetarian restaurants have become a form of speculative business here, sprouting up like mushrooms after the rain in the sluggish market.</p>
<p>Needless to say, in the eyes of female and male Buddhist followers, eating vegetarian means not killing living beings, and not killing living beings is a meritorious deed. In fact, among the 400 million people in China, those who cultivate this merit, to put it mildly, number 200 million. Country people are almost all "natural" vegetarians. Ascetics who gnaw on grass roots and tree bark are becoming more and more numerous every day. How many ordinary farmers can afford to eat meat three or two times a year? The chickens and pigs they treat as their own lives are not raised to satisfy the appetites of others? Therefore, the saying "Why not eat meat porridge?" is still a "cool breeze" even in good years.</p>
<p>However, after the high-ranking officials and gentlemen are tired of eating shark fins and bird's nests to the point of being fat and sluggish, eating tofu and meditating on "Jade Tablet Zen," returning from extreme splendor to simplicity, is not bad, and is also a way to maintain health.</p>
<p>I have no affinity with Buddhism, but I sometimes like to eat vegetarian food. Many of my relatives and friends are vegetarians. When I was twelve or thirteen years old, because of two vegetarian cousins, I began to know the flavor of vegetarian food. The elder cousin was a poor widow without children. Remaining a widow and eating vegetarian food naturally go together easily. The second cousin was an unmarried woman nearly thirty years old. Because she suffered a serious illness, her parents made a vow before the Bodhisattva to practice asceticism with her hair uncut. At that time, they often stayed overnight at our house, accompanying my mother and sister. They were good at cooking vegetarian dishes. On festivals and birthdays, they personally cooked for us. Vegetarian duck and vegetarian ham were made to look and taste just like the real thing. The elder cousin lived under the oppression of usury and the bullying of her sisters-in-law. She would secretly shed tears and sigh, and her face would turn red if she spoke a few words to strangers. The second cousin was clever and good at serving others, but she was a bit narrow-minded, and always seemed to have a chest full of depression. But they both liked my sister and me very much. Among the family, only the two of us sisters could make them laugh. At that time, our family was in</p>
<p>a kind of unfortunate situation. Their attentiveness and thoughtfulness gave my sickly and melancholy mother a lot of comfort, and we also gained two older sisters and nanny-like companions. Their home was not far from ours. As soon as dusk fell and we had eaten dinner, we sisters would go to fetch them. We often shed tears because they refused, and only stopped crying when they agreed. When we crossed the small stone bridge along the river, carrying the new moon, and brushed through the ruined garden hidden by flowering branches, back to our home, our young and elegant hearts were filled with the joy of victory. We hurriedly picked a few jasmine flowers blooming in the dusk in the courtyard, and insisted on putting them on their heads, to express our gratitude. After they talked with my mother, they would tell us stories and riddles in the yard. We felt unbearable loneliness if we didn't see them for a day. Truly, among our relatives, they were the only ones who left the deepest impression on our childhood.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten years have passed. More and more relatives and friends are studying Buddhism and eating vegetarian food. However, in the year I entered middle school, the second cousin passed away, suffering from the lung disease that women often get. As for the elder cousin, I haven't seen her for several years. I heard that she is still surviving, even though she often vomits a basin full of blood, and is old and haggard like an old woman, she still has to borrow new debts to repay old debts, relying on her ten fingers to live out her twilight years as a widow, half-starved and half-fed. Although their tragic experiences are not the result of eating vegetarian food, when I talk about eating vegetarian food, I can't help but think of my cousins' tragic experiences.</p>
<p>In a large part of Europe, women can almost be said to be vegetarians. They don't like to eat meat, not because they believe in Buddhism, nor because they are poor, but because they are afraid that eating meat will ruin their slender figures. However, there are also many true vegetarians. Moral concepts of protecting animals, or hygienic scientific ideas constitute their motivation. There are always several vegetarian restaurants in big cities. I have also tried it in Germany: vegetarian dishes are more expensive than meat dishes, and the taste is not as good as that of China; but cold dishes made of red and white radish shreds, chrysanthemum-like golden bamboo shoots, and emerald green lettuce, are particularly exquisite in carving and particularly bright in color, like a work of art, making people reluctant to put them in their mouths.</p>
<p>There is a monastic socialist group in Europe based on the moral philosophy of Nelson (a modern German philosopher). Vegetarianism, like peace, is its main tenet. One of our friends, Ms. A, belongs to this group. Sometimes when we gather together to make Chinese food, eating large glasses of wine and large pieces of meat, she would cook some tomatoes or eggs for herself to eat. We felt that she was a bit of a killjoy, and heated debates often broke out. She solemnly stated the profound meaning of eating vegetarian, and two or three gossipy boyfriends deliberately held opposing views, bringing out all possible arguments: A proved from the philosophical and biological point of view that plants and animals are equally important, B sophistically said that no matter how vegetarians abstain from killing, they always swallow countless microorganisms in a day, and C further explained from a sociological point of view that eating meat is an important key to human evolution, but no matter how eloquently we spoke, the argumentative Ms. A still insisted on her reasons, and sometimes when she got anxious, she said with a red face.</p>
<p>"You are sophistical, I won't argue with you."</p>
<p>When I was about to return to China, Ms. A specially ran from the outer city to Berlin to see us. In order to fulfill the duties of a host, we all ate vegetarian food, and even cooked the dishes ourselves. Once I wanted to make a spicy stir-fried shredded cabbage. In order to save effort, I used a toothed plane to grate the shreds. Who knew that the plane was too fast, and I accidentally cut my finger, taking off a piece of skin and flesh, and bleeding several drops. Mr. B, who was cooking with me, laughed at me for being useless, and then continued to grate. Who knew that he would also lose some flesh and blood as soon as he started. Although we washed the shredded cabbage carefully, we believed that there would always be some of our flesh and blood mixed in it.</p>
<p>"Eating vegetarian this time has turned into eating human flesh!" Mr. B chuckled.</p>
<p>This socialist group also runs a family-like small school in the countryside not far from Berlin, with food and lodging all in the school. A French friend of Mr. B had a six-year-old daughter, who was also studying there. After Hitler came to power, this group and its affiliated school became illegal and were dissolved. Entrusted by his friend, Mr. B took her daughter to Paris. I met this girl at Mr. B's house. Although she was as excited as other children when she saw cocoa candies and Western pastries, when we persuaded her to eat a slice of ham, she would stubbornly argue about the great principles of vegetarianism. We had already learned her arguments from Ms. A, and there was not much difference. Later, when she became more familiar with us, even others eating meat would elicit a small sermon from her.</p>
<p>"Annoying vegetarian preacher!" Mr. B said with a smile when he couldn't stand it anymore.</p>
<p>Now these friends have scattered, and I don't know where Ms. A has gone. Speaking of eating vegetarian, I can't help but bitterly remember them.</p>
<h3>Historical Tales of Friendship 2</h3>
<p>— Ling Jing</p>
<p>It is commonly said that Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya are the standard for friends who value faith and righteousness, but this may not be entirely accurate. According to the "Biography of Guan Zhong" in the "Records of the Grand Historian," Guan Zhong fully demonstrated that he was a petty man who only knew how to benefit himself, while Bao Shuya was a person of faith and righteousness who was "good enough as a friend." In general, it is relatively easy to simply talk about "faith" in friendship, but it is quite difficult to be able to fulfill "righteousness." Chinese people have always valued family concepts, especially the parent-child relationship, which is regarded as particularly important. Therefore, among the five relationships, the parent-child relationship ranks second, only one level lower than the ruler-subject relationship. However, the friend relationship ranks last, much less important than the sibling and spouse relationships. The "Book of Rites" says: "When parents are alive, one should not pledge to die for a friend." Because one has parents and pledges oneself to others, it is to forget one's parents. Therefore, if parents are still alive, a child cannot avenge his friend. It can be seen that it is not easy to achieve the "righteousness" between friends in China. However, although this is said, it is not necessarily true that everyone can follow the teachings of the sages. The "Twenty-Four Histories" are full of examples of valuing righteousness. The "Biography of Wu Fan" in the "Records of Wu" in the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" says:</p>
<p>"Fan and Wei Teng were from the same town and had a good relationship. Teng once committed a crime, and Quan was angry and strict, saying that anyone who dared to admonish would die. Fan said to Teng: "I will die with you!" Teng said: "Dying is useless, what is the use of dying?" Fan said: "How can I consider this and sit and watch you?" So he shaved his head and went to the gate, asking the guards to report it. The guards did not dare to report it, saying: "It will surely lead to death, I dare not report it." Fan said: "Do you have a son?" The guards said: "Yes." Fan said: "If I let your son die for Wu Fan, your son will belong to me."</p>
<p>The guards said: "Yes." So he pushed open the door and entered. Before he finished speaking, Quan was furious and wanted to throw a halberd at him. Fan quickly ran out, and Fan took the opportunity to rush in, kowtowing and shedding blood, speaking and weeping at the same time. After a long time, Quan's anger subsided and he spared Teng. When Teng saw Fan, he thanked him and said: "My parents could give birth to me and raise me, but they could not save me from death. For a man to know each other, having you is enough, what need is there for more?"</p>
<p>Wu Fan's saving of Wei Teng was entirely for the "righteousness" of friendship, which moved Wei Teng to say something quite "rebellious." If the Duke of Zhou and Confucius were in Wei Teng's situation that day, they would probably overturn their own teachings that they considered to be great principles. However, we cannot blindly use the word "righteousness." The kind of righteousness of the Jianghu gangs is not worthy of our emulation. We should add a sense of right and wrong to private feelings. Wu Fan's sacrifice to save Wei Teng was because Wei Teng was indeed a gentleman with a rigid nature and did not act in a compromising manner. If Wei Teng was a despicable villain who coveted power and misled the country, then Wu Fan's actions would probably not be understood and would not be recorded in history. The importance of being a man lies in the sense of right and wrong. If you can grasp this key point, at least you can be considered to have done half of being a man. If you further "sacrifice yourself for righteousness," you will naturally become a great hero without a doubt. Wu Fan is one, and Wang Hui's actions in the Song Dynasty were even more unrestrained. The "Biography of Zou Hao" in the "History of the Song Dynasty" says:</p>
<p>"Wang Hui, whose courtesy name was Jing Shen, was from Xianyou. He was a good friend of Zou Hao. When Empress Liu was established, Hao was about to discuss it and secretly told Hui. Hui said: "Is there anything greater than this matter? Although you have parents, transferring filial piety to loyalty is also the long-cherished wish of the old lady." Hao moved south, and no one cared for him. Hui collected money from his friends to prepare for his journey, and went back and forth to manage it, personally comforting his mother. The guards reported it, and he was arrested and sent to prison. Everyone was afraid for him, but Hui remained calm. The censor questioned him, and he replied: "I did participate in the discussion, I dare not deceive." Then he recited the two thousand words of Hao's memorial. When the prison report was submitted, his name was removed and he was dismissed. He immediately walked out of the capital gate. After walking dozens of miles, his son caught up and asked about family matters, and he answered again..."</p>
<p>Like Wang Hui's actions, although his starting point was still the word "righteousness," it was too unrestrained after all, because even if he did not admit to conspiring, it would not necessarily hinder Zou Hao, and admitting it would still not reduce Zou Hao's crime. However, everyone has their own personality, and it is impossible to force people to do things they don't want to do. His kind of ancient style is quite worthy of reflection in today's frivolous and servile society. Tao Zongyi of the Ming Dynasty recorded a story in his "辍耕录," which is also close to a righteous act, but is not the same as the behavior of the two people mentioned above, but is somewhat "close to ostentation":</p>
<p>"In Hangzhou's subordinate county, there was a wealthy family that relied on wealth and power to abuse good people. The county officials were corrupt and no one dared to do anything. The people could not bear it and ran to the constitutional government to sue. The wealthy family fled and hid. The constitutional envoy was angry and ordered the authorities to severely punish them, showing the crimes and rewards, posting them on the main roads, and going to each house to post announcements: Those who hide them will be implicated! Those who capture them will be rewarded with ten thousand strings of cash. His friend, Wang Yishan, a scholar by profession, lived in the No. 1 building in the lake and mountains. He hid him secretly and did not reveal him for a month. A neighbor found out and planned to seek the reward money, reporting it to the official. The official searched and found him, and arrested and imprisoned Wang together. When he saw the constitutional envoy, the envoy asked: "Do you know what crime he committed?" Wang said: "I know." "Have you heard of the laws of the country?" He said: "I know." "Have you seen the announcement of crimes and rewards?" He said: "I have seen it." "Why don't you seek profit and avoid harm?" He said: "When a friend is in trouble and comes to me for help, taking advantage of his danger to sell him out is not allowed by the teachings of morality. I sincerely cannot bear to do it. If the matter is discovered and I am implicated, I am willing to do so." The envoy was startled and said: "The gentleman said, 'Do not seek to avoid danger.' This person practices it. He is truly a righteous man. If I add to his crime, it is because my government is harsh and my punishment is excessive. How can the people be encouraged?" So he released him..."</p>
<p>Tao Zongyi and this constitutional envoy both praised Wang Yishan's virtue of righteousness, perhaps because Tu Yishan was a Confucian wearing a square scarf. In fact, they were both fooled by this gentleman with a square scarf. Who knows if his hiding of the wealthy family was not for the sake of "relying on good fortune" in the future? Relying only on a few clichés of a corrupt scholar, he was allowed to escape the law and was full of the reputation of "righteous man." I think this constitutional envoy must also be a fame-seeker. There is a story in "Laughing Zen Records": "Ju Yi asked Xue Feng to ask the master to indicate the Buddhist Dharma. Feng said: "What are you talking about? Two friends, A and B, were usually very close. One day, A happened to be ill and could not bear the pain. B came to ask and said: Brother, what is your illness? What do you need? I can do it all. A said: I am suffering from the disease of money, and I only need two or three cymbals to recover. B immediately pretended not to hear and swallowed and said: What did you say? Song said: Gold is as precious as the Buddha Dharma, the Buddha Dharma is as precious as gold. When you look for it, you cannot get it. I have already reassured you." Wang Yishan is probably one of the A and B types."</p>
<h3>A Couple (1)</h3>
<p>— Bai Chen</p>
<p>Tram number three was heading south from Carter Road. It stopped at the New Zhabei Bridge. It was three o'clock after lunch, and there were quite a few people getting on the tram. Eight out of ten of the third-class passengers by the entrance of the trailer were people in short gowns. However, those squeezed by the small third-class entrance were people in long gowns, and there were even a few people in suits. At the first-class entrance, there was no one—no, while people were crowding into the small third-class entrance, two passengers ran to the first-class entrance. In front was a man with a fair and clean face, and behind was a woman with light lipstick on her lips.</p>
<p>There was no one in first class. The man just ran straight in. The woman entered and tilted her backside to sit down. With a "whoosh," the man pulled open the glass door and squeezed into the third-class carriage. The woman looked back and followed him in.</p>
<p>The man spread his buttocks and opened his legs, claiming two seats to sit down. A friend who came in from the small third-class entrance rolled his eyes at him. The woman had already picked it up: The man folded his legs, and the woman sat down. She looked around and lowered her head to ask the man: "Third class?"</p>
<p>The man glared at her and nodded.</p>
<p>The tram rattled past a station.</p>
<p>"Soy Sauce Lane!"</p>
<p>The ticket seller came over, weighing the coins in his hand, and circled them in front of everyone's faces.</p>
<p>"Do you have any?" He asked.</p>
<p>The man didn't make a sound.</p>
<h3>The Birthday of Dizang</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiru</p>
<p>By evening, the children living together were chattering like birds returning to their nests, fighting over the sweet potatoes. They stuck burning incense sticks all over the sweet potatoes, making them look like hedgehogs. Then they strung them with thread and held them in their hands or hung them in the hall. They watched these spiky hedgehogs of fire, jumping and shouting with joy, even though the thick smoke stung their eyes so much they couldn't open them.</p>
<p>Seeing this peculiar toy, it was like suddenly recalling something long forgotten, remembering that today is the thirtieth day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar, the birthday of Dizang Wang (Earth Store Bodhisattva).</p>
<p>Hearing the fellow residents say that by nightfall, the streets would be full of large and small incense balls, some made of pumpkins, some of sweet potatoes, and many made of very large rice gourds, along the steps of each house, forming a long row of incense sticks. Moreover, people closed their doors early, so going for a stroll on the street tonight would have a different flavor.</p>
<p>Being urged by the fellow residents, I hadn't planned to go out that night, but after finishing dinner, I wanted to go out and take a look.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the dark long street, there were groups of wild children running, shouting, and laughing. Before my eyes were patterns formed by small dots of fire, with thick smoke. Even in such a dark night, you could see how furiously it was spewing. The scent of incense sticks, which was not very pleasant to begin with, was now so excessively strong that it was unbearable, as if it were pickling the brain.</p>
<p>I forced myself to walk for a few dozen houses, but in the end, I couldn't force myself any longer. With a feeling of grievance, I quickly ran back.</p>
<p>As I stepped into the doorway of my residence, I ran into one of the fellow residents. He greeted me with a smile:</p>
<p>"Not bad, right? That...!"</p>
<p>I felt that his smile had a hint of mockery.</p>
<p>"There are too many incense sticks lit, it's too strong and unbearable!" I said.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's the birthday of Dizang!" The fellow resident was a little surprised.</p>
<p>"And it's just lighting incense, it's too monotonous. Why not add some candles?"</p>
<p>"No way! Today is the birthday of Dizang!" He said again, surprised. "He's going to pass by here tonight!"</p>
<p>I wanted to say that lighting a few more candles and lighting a few less incense sticks, to light up a section of the road for him, so that he would sneeze a few less times, wouldn't Dizang Wang be even more welcome? But when I saw his serious face, I pretended to understand everything and "uh"ed a few times. The road came in.</p>
<p>A few days later, I learned the whole story from others.</p>
<p>Because of his great power and high position, Dizang Wang does not easily open his eyes. Perhaps it is because he does not easily open his eyes? If he saw so much sin and so much evil of mankind, he would not like it and would bring disasters to mankind, such as earthquakes and plagues. Wouldn't this destroy mankind in a few strokes? No, people have ways to deal with it. That is, when this Bodhisattva goes on patrol or opens his eyes, nominally they are welcoming him or paying respect to him, but in reality, they are using this thick smoke to prevent him from looking directly or staying for a while. This method can be said to be the same as bribing the Kitchen God when bribing heaven.</p>
<p>Mankind has not yet been exterminated. We seem to owe it to ourselves for being able to come up with such a clever and win-win method of coping.</p>
<p>I have seen the statue of Dizang Wang in the temple. Solemn! Great! But his eyes are closed. I always feel that his closed eyelids were forced to be closed by us humans, especially by those with deep sins.</p>
<p>And I now also believe that he is used to this kind of life, and he will be willing to close his eyes even on the one day that mankind specifically allows him to open his eyes and go on patrol, after being deceived countless times.</p>
<h3>Mother</h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>Let the sound of the scattered rain knock back the heart of the shattered wanderer!</p>
<p>No, the wanderer's heart was shattered long ago – that was eight years ago when the waves of the era rose.</p>
<p>At that time, I was very young. What did a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old girl understand? However, in order to study, I simply changed my life. I remember: After I began to put down the pen that was learning from Bing Xin to write poems praising my mother, I eliminated my idle worries, strengthened myself, yearned for light, and went forward fearlessly.</p>
<p>Who knew that in this way, I began my life of drifting and wandering.</p>
<p>I love my mother, but I gave her sorrow. None of the hopes that all mothers of the old century placed on their daughters did I give her. What I gave her was:</p>
<p>The ridicule of relatives! The slander of feudal society! …</p>
<p>I also remember her crying in front of me. At first I was sad, then I was indignant! Mother, why can't you be a mother of all humanity!</p>
<p>Although I knew that it was for my own pure, brave, and youthful innocence that I accepted the misfortunes of the world. But to reverse this misfortune, it was clear that I had to break away from everything and embark on the road of my own century.</p>
<p>Here, I repeatedly left my beloved mother with a body full of wounds.</p>
<p>For five years, I have traveled north and south, tasting the bitter wine of the era. Every time I saw an old man with white hair, I couldn't help but think of my mother at home.</p>
<p>Mother! I don't know what the beauty of your white hair has become? I can only guess during the day, and search in my dreams, dragging a tired body, and coming to this rainy and windy foreign land again.</p>
<p>The exotic atmosphere cannot move my heart. Those who are used to wandering have long forgotten the difference between the ends of the earth and their hometown. Only when I think of my mother, I am afraid to listen to the low hum of the wind and the sob of the rain!</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>New High Price for Gold Speculation: 1152 Yuan</h3>
<p>Situation Stable Before Special Tax Increase on Both Parties, Exchange Market Tense, Resulting in a Sharp Rise of 18.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was initially stable in the morning session due to news of the exchange increasing special tax on sellers. However, rumors about "Fuxing" (a company or entity) emerged in the afternoon, leading to overwhelming buying interest and pushing the price to a new peak of 1152 yuan. Initial market conditions were calm, with overseas silver markets showing a slight decline in England and stability in America. The forward silver price in Montreux remained unchanged or slightly decreased. Exchange rates were generally positive, and the London gold price remained stable. Market sentiment was peaceful. The exchange then issued a notice stating that sellers must also pay a special deposit of 50 yuan per bar, and that guaranteed shares under brand names, using only the deposit, should not exceed 70 bars. This boosted general confidence. Pre-market trading opened, immediately rising to 23-24 yuan, with strong buying demand. It further rose to over 30 yuan. Several major firms sold, gradually retreating to within 20 yuan. The morning session opened lower, gradually declining due to heavy selling pressure, but maintained a level after the drop. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed a decrease in both British and American rates, while the customs gold unit rose by one-third of a cent. The standard gold price was listed at 1042.8 yuan. Market sentiment remained steady, gradually rising to above 20 yuan. Banks initially supported the shilling, temporarily strengthening it, but then took advantage of the high prices to release US dollars, anticipating the HSBC exchange rate. The British rate remained flat, while the American rate rose by 0.0625. Soon after, it dropped back to within 20 yuan. Sassoon and Shanghai firms heavily sold shillings, hardening the domestic market and triggering active selling. It gradually declined again, but banks and the Sanwa Bank bought in at lower prices, maintaining a stable level. It gradually recovered to above 20 yuan. The forecast for Indian silver was a drop of six annas. The situation remained stable at noon. Later, a Reuters news report about the Central Bank of Manchuria ordering the centralization of silver reserves stirred the market. The market immediately stabilized upon opening. Cantonese merchants bought US dollars, increasing buying interest and breaking through the 30 yuan barrier. Rumors emerged again, and Xinyie and Jiaotong banks bought, causing extreme tension in the exchange market. Major players re-entered the market, breaking through the 50 yuan barrier. Sellers began to appear, but due to the two small declines in Indian silver prices totaling ten annas, there were multiple price fluctuations, and a brief drop occurred. However, with weak bank selling pressure, buyers eagerly chased, creating a new peak of 1152 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain bank sold heavily at the high price, and rumors spread that someone strongly opposed expansion, leading to a sudden plunge of 18 yuan. It finally stabilized. The forward premium was even higher. Sellers had offered 35 yuan yesterday.</p>

<h3>Chinese Merchants Again Buy Foreign Exchange, Flat at First, Then Suddenly Tight</h3>
<p>Banks Lack Forward Selling Appetite, Domestic Market Situation Extremely Tense</p>
<p>According to foreign news, London's long-term exchange rate was nearly flat while the short-term rate decreased by 0.0625. New York's silver market was stable. Montreux's forward silver prices were unchanged or slightly decreased. London's gold price was unchanged. The British rate rose by 0.125 against the US dollar, and the British rate rose by 0.25 against the franc. The British rate rose by six pounds against the Italian lira, and the US dollar rose by one lira against the franc. The exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices of 1 shilling, 4 pence, and 3.125 for British currency and 33.4375 yuan for US currency.

The Central Bank's announcement showed a decrease of 0.025 in the British rate and 0.5 yuan in the US rate. The customs gold unit rose by one-third of a cent. Market sentiment was relatively stable. Banks initially supported the shilling, but the process was slightly soft. Because banks took advantage of the high prices to sell US dollars, and anticipating that HSBC would list the British rate as flat while the American rate rose by 0.0625, it was difficult to tighten further. Sassoon sold shillings again, as did Shanghai firms. Although banks traded against each other, they also sold US dollars. Afterward, the process hardened. However, Chinese merchants still had an appetite to buy. Banks and Sanwa took advantage of the low prices to maintain, and the situation remained flat. The forecast for Indian silver was a small decrease of six annas. The process hovered around noon, lacking special changes. The market tightened immediately upon opening in the afternoon. Reuters reported positive news. Banks bought shillings. Cantonese merchants bought US dollars, and the market became increasingly tight. The Hong Kong market was also soft. The initial report for Indian silver was a decrease of eight annas, and the second was a small decrease of two annas. At this moment, the process was the tightest. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell and make multiple trades. Later, due to negative rumors, the process began to loosen. The closing prices for recent selling prices were 1 shilling, 3 pence, and 8.125 for British currency and 32.3125 yuan for US currency. Compared to the previous close, the British rate tightened by 0.5 pence, and the US rate tightened by 1.0625 yuan. Chinese merchants were still eager to buy. Rumors circulated that certain large Chinese banks and major players were secretly and aggressively buying shillings. Although banks sold, they did not sell smoothly, and there were no forward positions. The Hong Kong market also suspended forward trading.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Adding Water to Head Money to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Domestic Market Interest Rates Open at 5.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Everyone knows the current market is in distress. The reporters need not to explain this. However, in the past few days, adding water to head money has continued to increase, raising prices. The reason is nothing more than the fact that large foreign loan payments are being made, and head money is gradually becoming unsustainable. Now, with foreign exchange settlement and expenditure of difference money, and various payments for imported goods, a huge amount must be paid out at the end of the month, so head money is particularly tight. Adding water to head money is therefore expensive due to the shortage. In a few days, it has risen from 0.7-0.8 cents to 0.2 yuan. As for foreign exchange loans, due to credit concerns, no one dares to accept the loan, and even if they do, no one is willing to grant it. Therefore, there is very little competition in the market, and the result is no significant change. Most of the various long-term loans that have come due have been completed. There are still many loans that have not come due and will gradually come due soon, totaling no less than 30 million. They must be sorted out in these three days. Yesterday, the amount due at banks was several hundred thousand, and the amount due for credit loans at Qianzhuang was 5-600,000, and pledge loans were more than 1.5 million, with a total of 5-6 million. Most of them were transferred to accounts. In addition, many long-term deposits have been negotiated and fixed, and the interest rate must be based on domestic market interest rates. However, the domestic market interest rate on the 27th had already opened at 5.5 yuan, equivalent to the previous period. This time, most depositors want an additional 0.5 or 1 yuan based on the domestic market interest rate. It is reported that over 1 million agreed to add 0.5 yuan and 1 yuan. The remaining interest rates are fixed based on the domestic market price. In addition, there are some scattered long-term deposits, which have come due for account transfers and repayments, totaling approximately 2-300,000. These are personal loans from various shops in the concession, so they have not been added to the overall market price.</p>
<h3>Silver Movements in the London Market: China Sells, America Buys</h3>
<p>In the London silver market in the past month (September 30 to October 28), America was a major buyer, China was a major seller, and India had both buying and selling. In the first half of the month, it was buying, and in the second half of the month, it was selling. China, due to fears of inflation and the skyrocketing gold price, experienced even more capital flight. Those with funds rushed to buy foreign exchange. Banks also promoted "foreign currency deposits." The strong buying of foreign exchange inevitably led to the selling of silver. It is said that China had a silver trade surplus of 7 million yuan in previous quarters, so selling is not a problem. However, the amount of silver sold this time is currently unknown, so we cannot be too optimistic. In short, silver prices are fluctuating, and there is no hope for market recovery.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of silver buying and selling by various parties this month:</p>
<p>|          | Buying | Selling | Both Buying and Selling |</p>
<p>|----------|--------|---------|------------------------|</p>
<p>| America  | 18     | -       | 1                      |</p>
<p>| China    | 1      | 14      | 3                      |</p>
<p>| India    | 8      | 7       | 1                      |</p>
<p>| Speculators | 1      | 5       | 1                      |</p>
<h3>Securities: October Government Bond Delivery and its Process</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 29th, the Chinese Securities Exchange was the delivery date for October futures. The total delivery amount was 34,645,000 yuan. After deducting inter-broker account transfers and self-delivery, a total of 18,455,000 yuan was settled. Only 16,190,000 yuan was delivered at the exchange, with a larger amount being delivered off-exchange. In terms of delivery, Number 16 was mostly in the lead. In terms of receiving, Numbers 48 and 78 were the most. The most delivered goods were 96 bonds, totaling 7,185,000 yuan. Secondly, salt tax bonds totaled 1,575,000 yuan. Demobilization deliveries were only 2,300,000 yuan. This shows that although trading is uniquely strong, there are more floating empty positions, and speculation is overheated, resulting in increased infighting. Speaking of the trading process of October futures, it lasted for more than 50 days, with the greatest difference being 6 yuan. Generally, the market price on the last day of October 25 was mostly equal to the market price when the initial auction opened on August 30. The environmental situation involved various relationships such as silver capital, diplomacy, and international affairs. Market prices fluctuated endlessly. Rumors of inflation took the opportunity to rise, leading to the organization of bull companies, which repeatedly increased prices, and the market price gradually recovered. This relates to the silver capital aspect. Relations between China and Japan became closer, but various rumors also arose, some of which were unbearable to hear. This relates to the diplomatic aspect. International affairs shifted from the war in Zhang-A to the conflict between Britain and Italy, sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, and still have not reached a concrete resolution. The conflict between Japan and Russia seemed to be right and wrong, leading to the frenzy of speculators. Other factors, such as the skyrocketing of gold speculation and the raising of 96 bonds, were mostly caused by human efforts, but they still had a significant impact on the government bond market. The above-mentioned factors are still fluctuating, so the future is feared that human efforts will ultimately not overcome the facts. Twelve-month futures will be auctioned from today, and it will likely still be very lively.</p>
<p>The following are the October futures delivery account transfers and their total transaction numbers, listed separately (unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Filling Gaps and Speculation Rise Together, Cotton Yarn Soars Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>New price of cotton yarn: 188.838.50</p>
<p>The cotton market is as swift as a rabbit. The situation remains turbulent and volatile, completely dominated by the gold rush. In the initial internal bidding, the gold market was calm, and market sentiment was relatively mild. Tongji, which had made heavy purchases the previous day, released a significant amount, causing the market to suddenly loosen and decline. In the afternoon, upon hearing of the rise in gold prices, it returned to its peak, and market enthusiasm immediately intensified. Buying surged again, rumors of inflation arose, and speculators once again aggressively raised prices, causing market prices to soar again, reaching new highs for each month.</p>
<p>Selling Accounts of Jinji Disappear</p>
<p>Before the cotton yarn bidding opened, prices for all months declined again, as gold prices hovered around 1,120 yuan. New buyers in the market were relatively scarce, and market prices were slightly sluggish, with selling particularly strong. Tongji, which had made aggressive purchases the previous day, suddenly released as many as 3,000 to 4,000 bales, filling the market with chips, and causing the market to decline step by step. As a result, each month fell by 1.5 to 2.4 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market situation suddenly became tense, and buyers in the market suddenly became enthusiastic. At the same time, rumors were rife, and sellers disappeared, with prices rising higher and higher with each bid. Gold prices repeatedly broke new highs, and the majority's bullish sentiment became increasingly fervent and frenzied. Moreover, with the upcoming delivery day, the market was closed, and general retail investors were all squeezed to hold overnight, making the trend particularly popular. As a result, each month rose by 5 to 3.7 yuan compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafu sold 1,050 bales, Tongfu 1,300 bales, Tongji 4,300 bales, Yuanda 1,000 bales, Mingde 1,200 bales, Changfeng 3,300 bales, Yongchang 900 bales, Runkang 600 bales, Yukang 800 bales, and Xincheng 800 bales.

<p>Zheng Cotton Bidding Sees Strong Buying Interest</p>
<p>Before the cotton bidding opened, prices for all months uniformly declined, and the market felt particularly loose. With gold prices stable and rumors subsided, and the cotton yarn market sluggish, prices declined step by step. As a result, each month fell by 4, 5, or 6 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price.

<h3>American Cotton Arbitrage Resumes</h3>
<p>British and Indian Cotton Also See Little Progress</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, the market was sluggish, and prices were flat as few accepted the arbitrage offers. Prices for all months rose or fell by 2 points. Midway through, due to limit-price buying by fellow traders and local short covering, there was a slight rebound. Afterwards, arbitrage resumed, long positions were liquidated, and the government slightly sold December contracts and bought October contracts for the following year. Rain in the eastern and central regions was unfavorable to the movement of new cotton, but outside buying interest was also limited. According to southern reports, spot cotton export demand continued to be good, and prices remained firm. The closing was flat. Spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 6 to 8 points. The new October contract rose by 2 points. British spot cotton rose by 1 point, and futures fell by 1 to 3 points. The Indian cotton market was sluggish, and trading was sparse.

<h3>Grain and Gold Markets Rebound, Flour and Wheat Rise After Falling</h3>
<p>The flour market is in a chaotic state, with frequent ups and downs. When prices opened in the morning, they fell sharply because Chicago prices continued to fall by 4 jiao and Canadian prices fell by 6 jiao. The market sentiment both inside and outside the industry felt deeply uneasy. Some overbought positions were again eager to sell off, causing the price for the current month to plummet by 5 fen, down to only 7 jiao 9 fen. The prices for the remaining months also fell sharply by 3 to 5 fen due to the smooth outflow of selling accounts. Later, trading in all sectors was brisk, and prices tended to fluctuate. When the market opened in the afternoon, it saw a major surge again, as the gold market rose sharply, seeing a new record high. This caused market sentiment to be stirred, and prices rebounded by 3 to 4 fen compared to the morning prices. Market sentiment is that the gold price will continue to rise sharply, and it is feared that the flour market will follow suit, causing worrying volatility.</p>

<p>The wheat market initially showed a sharp decline followed by a rise. Because foreign wheat prices continued to fall by about 4 to 6 jiao, it seemed that the foreign wheat market had greatly eased. Therefore, most speculative longs could not help but feel uneasy, and prices opened down by 5 to 6 fen. Later, because the decline in the flour market was very sharp, prices fell even more. From November to January, prices fell by 7 to 8 fen. The February contract fell the most sharply, falling by 1 jiao 3 fen. Until the afternoon, the market was initially stable, but then the gold market soared, and flour also rebounded, causing speculative buying to surge again. The price increases for each month varied slightly due to different trading volumes. For example, the rebound in the December contract even exceeded the morning decline, while the remaining contracts rebounded by 6 to 7 fen to nearly a jiao, similar to the previous day. Spot wheat prices have eased slightly, and customers have not tightened up. Sales of each grade opened, falling by about 5 to 6 fen. Shandong wheat opened at 4 yuan 6 jiao 4 fen, and Yaowan Gaoyou wheat opened at 4 yuan 6 jiao, totaling 4,000 bales. It is said that Shanfu has just opened a new office. In addition, the 800 yuan special certificate for grain delivery has been cancelled. From yesterday onwards, the margin for wheat and soybean bidding is uniformly 400 yuan, and the margin for oil cakes is uniformly 280 yuan. After the market stabilizes, the old system will be restored.</p>

<h3>Hexia Rice Sales Rebound By More Than a Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only about 10 to 20 sources arrived from each group (a total of more than 4,000 shi). Market sentiment was calm. Both retail and wholesale sales were available. Sellers seized the opportunity to raise prices, so the situation was tight. As a result, the price of Ruohou Xinjing rice rebounded by about a jiao. Kiln-grown Baige Tianjin continued to handle 600 to 700 bales, and prices also rose by a jiao. However, due to seasonal factors, the market remained stable with only thin profit margins. Thinly broken bales continued for 400 to 500 bales, but prices could only be maintained. As for Yebai rice and Jinguo Huang, etc., all rose by more than a chi. Duyangjian and Lujian, because the sales path is smoother than Yangjian, opened with Yangjian being 1 jiao higher, while Lujian had a premium of 1 jiao 5 fen. Due to the lack of goods, the Yinyuan rice market was quiet.</p>
<p>28th 29th Change</p>
<p>Su Tong Xinjing 9.50 9.60 Up 1 jiao</p>

<p>Nangang Quan Jing 9.70 9.80 Up 1 jiao</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) About 40 sources arrived. The sales of various goods on the market continued. Xinjing rice continued to be in demand in the early market, and prices rose tightly by several fen to nearly a jiao. In the afternoon market, retail sales turned slightly sluggish. Yangbu Jian continued to arrive, and retail discounts were also good, with prices increasing by about a jiao. Dujian settled, Kejian retail sales remained dull, and prices were stable. Baiyuan and Kiln-grown settled, early rice was slightly tight by several fen, and the remaining goods settled.</p>
<h3>Local and Out-of-Town Speculators Purchase Ke Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Prices Gradually Rise by 1 Jiao</p>
<p>(Ke Xian) Although arrivals are strong, out-of-town speculators and northern brokers are still active. Speculators bought more than 1,000 bales of Gan rice, while Tianjin brokers bought more than 10 bales of Yong rice. Local retail sales are also active, with nearly 1,000 bales of Yong rice, more than 1,000 bales of rice, 300 bales of Wenzhou rice, and 752 bales of Hankou Shashi Anqing rice being purchased. Because local and out-of-town speculators are both eating, prices are gradually rising by 5 to 6 fen to 1 jiao.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Both imports and exports are sluggish. Yesterday, only 300 bales of Xiaojiao rice were opened, and 200 bales of Luoyuan rice were opened. Prices are gradually rising by 6 fen compared to before.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods and Sun-Dried Longan Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Sun-dried Longan: According to news from Liuzhou yesterday, the purchase price has risen to 80 yuan. Adding all external expenses, the price in Shanghai must be over 90 yuan. This is indeed the highest price this year, but considering the situation, the market is still expected to tighten further. It is possible that it will reach 100 yuan in the future. At the same time, it was also heard that prices in Tongan have also risen by 7 to 8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Peanut Kernels Open Firm</h3>
<p>Peanut kernels continued to open yesterday, with Yantai kernels opening at 8 yuan 5 jiao for 100 bales, Tancheng kernels opening at 7 yuan 8 jiao for 60 bales, Suqian peanuts opening at 5 yuan 7 jiao, and Pizhou peanuts opening at 6 yuan 1 jiao.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Chen Xianzhou's Antiques Aid Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ji</p>
<p>According to a Hankou dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 24th: Hubei collector Chen Xianzhou is willing to donate more than 4,000 pieces of antiques from his collection, valued at 800,000 yuan, entirely for disaster relief funds. This cannot be said to be a major event in the midst of disaster relief efforts.</p>
<p>This year's floods in various regions are more severe than in the past, but in terms of relief, the government authorities do not have the same overall policy as in previous years. Although civil servants have been ordered to donate salaries to aid disaster relief, the 20 million yuan disaster relief public bond was only approved by the Central Political Conference the day before yesterday and must still be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. It is uncertain when it will be issued, and it is even more impossible to say when it will reach the hands of the disaster victims. As for the general public, there is no longer the same enthusiasm as in previous years. Variety shows, flower selections, and dance selections are held all day and night, but only 15,000 yuan is sent to the charity association. The film industry uses female stars to appeal, but how much has been raised is not publicly announced. However, it is said that the floor of the ticket office is full of torn-up discount coupons. Although there is a sign in front of the dance hall that says "Dance a little more, save a life," everyone in the dance floor is still reluctant to move forward. The disaster relief swim using mermaids to appeal only attracted more than 1,000 spectators. We do not know how the soccer game went in Shanghai, but in Nanjing it also only attracted more than 1,000 people. Based on past performance, the upcoming total mobilization of boy scouts for disaster relief will not necessarily have surprising results.</p>
<p>Analyzing this phenomenon, most of the reasons are naturally due to the general economic recession in society. People are too busy saving themselves to care about saving others. But the death of the human heart is also evident. Why? Today's social economy is indeed in a recession, but there are still many wealthy families who can remain unaffected by relying on the legacy of their ancestors and current exploitation. However, they are unwilling to pluck a single hair to benefit the world. Is this not evidence of the death of the human heart?</p>
<p>Now, Chen Xianzhou is actually willing to sacrifice all of his more than 4,000 pieces of antiques. In this death of the human heart, this cannot be said to be a glimmer of human light, which can serve as a wake-up call to the general misers! We know that antiques are indeed called "external possessions," but for someone who loves antiques to be willing to donate antiques, especially those worth a huge 800,000 yuan, this cannot be done without a generous and righteous spirit. Therefore, Chen Xianzhou's actions are particularly worthy of our admiration and praise.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a region where talented people gather, and there must be no shortage of antique collectors as rich as Chen Xianzhou, but we have not seen anyone as generous and righteous as Chen Xianzhou. We sincerely hope that people will be inspired by this news and not let him be the only one to excel. We also want to sincerely tell the officials in charge of disaster relief that they should still focus on this aspect and stop focusing on women.</p>
<h3>Occupation</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>He was awakened from a sweet dream by the alarm clock, and the room was pitch black. He rubbed his sleepy eyes, savoring the illusion in his dream. The pain of life's oppression crawled over his heart like a snake again. He had thought of quitting his current job several times. The salary was so meager that he could not even support himself with the endless work from morning till night. When he received his father's tearful letter from home, he did not have the courage to pick up a pen. Could he even tell his father about this kind of life? And how could he answer his father's wishes?</p>
<p>Grayish-white light had already leaked into the room, symbolizing his own future. He reluctantly got out of bed, turned on the light, and saw his haggard face in the mirror. The tangled thoughts prevented him from indulging in futile fantasies again. People had to live!</p>
<p>When he went out, the sky was covered in white fog, and the road was quiet without a single pedestrian. The morning in the city was desolate enough. Who would get up early if not for profit? Occasionally, he saw a few street cleaners in red vests, bending over,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>like an old horse that had lost its master's affection. They swept the fallen leaves from the trees with a broom, half-heartedly. However, most of the bald branches had already been wrapped in straw. The branches were preparing for winter, but what about the pitiful street cleaners? They were breathing and shrugging their shoulders, trying to get through this winter that felt like a century!</p>
<p>He bought a few pancakes from a pancake stand at the entrance of the alley to fill his stomach. The owner of the pancake stand was very familiar with him, and always greeted him with a smile. Although he knew that this was a means for the shopkeeper to attract customers, he was still satisfied that there was still warmth in this world. Every day from taking the tram to returning to that narrow cage, was there anyone who saw him as an equal?</p>
<p>He always took the first tram out of the factory. The ticket sellers in the tram were dozing off. They seemed to have gotten used to it, nodding, buying tickets, and each occupying a corner, lowering their heads to enjoy a little more peace and quiet. When he got off at the Bund outside the main road, the clock on the Jianghai Customs Building was already 7:20. He stepped on the pier, where the dew of the night had not yet awakened, and found a small steamer with a red chimney mark. When he saw his colleagues, they nodded to each other, and several of them climbed into the cabin like machines. It seemed a little warmer here. Everyone was smoking or flipping through the day's newspapers. This time was very precious, and after that, they would be beasts of burden for ten hours. The steamer departed at 7:30 and took 45 minutes to reach the factory. But there were exceptions, and it was okay for the foreign foreman to be late, but if an employee missed the steamer, you would sacrifice two days' wages if you did not ask for leave in advance. Although they were also office staff, they were treated the same as workers.</p>
<p>Initially, he saw an advertisement in the newspaper for a typist for this company's Shanghai office. After half a day of exams, he was lucky enough to be selected among dozens of people wanting to snatch the job. But the next day, when he went to the office, the foreign boss ordered him to go to the factory in Pudong. The preferential treatment naturally disappointed him, and his status as a college student was also seen as a piglet, the same as the workers! But people had to live, did he have the courage to refuse this order?</p>
<p>The steamer cut through the thick fog on the river and moved forward at high speed. The sound of the engine was like a hammer hitting everyone's heart in the cabin. Although everyone exchanged warm glances, no one could break the silence. Everyone had a pale face and sluggish movements. During this time, he always looked out at the river, watching the surging tide, watching it bravely crash against the ship's hull wave after wave. Until the steamer turned into the small port, the river became as calm as a mirror, and his heart also calmed down. But the red wall of the tall factory building had already reflected into his eyes from the hold. Looking back, his fellow people, who shared the same fate, were mustering up their energy to prepare to disembark, but he felt tired and unable to move.</p>
<h3>Silent Night Market Sounds</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>This place was originally a small market town at its edge. Once night falls, everything becomes even more quiet. The soft sound of fallen plane tree leaves on the roadside, the footsteps and coughs of passersby on the village path outside the fence, can all be heard with extreme clarity. The house happens to be near the main road. Although it is late at night, the only wonton seller in this small town who hawks his wares at night, always knocks his clapper at a fixed time, with a slow and leisurely rhythm, approaching from afar. Every time I hear the unchanging clapper gradually approaching, and then gradually fading away, my mind is filled with a distant longing. I feel that this clapper sound is much more pleasant than the popular songs and music broadcast from the neighbor's radio.</p>
<p>For a long time, I only heard this one and only wonton clapper. In this small town, I didn't find it strange. Until recently, for the past few nights, before the wonton vendor passed by, there was an additional hawker selling sandalwood olives. At first, I couldn't quite make out what he was calling out to sell. I only felt that his three different tones and intonations were filled with a kind of moving and desolate charm. I couldn't resist the lure of this selling voice, and couldn't help but walk to the doorway and look towards the neighboring fence. In the small gap of the fence, a dim lamp quietly leaked in, and a vague figure passed by in a desolate manner.</p>
<p>At that time, I stood at the door, my emotions completely captivated by this illusion. I watched the desolate lamp disappear behind a low wall before returning to my desk, feeling somewhat lost. I regretted why I didn't stop the hawker to see what kind of person he was. Perhaps he was a hunched and weak old man, who might even recount his desolate life to me and exchange it for a few hard-earned copper coins from my hand.</p>
<p>That night, my mood was truly disturbed by that desolate selling voice. Even when I was lying in bed, I felt as if I had lost something, or as if I had done something regrettable behind someone's back. After the wonton clapper passed by with its leisurely sound, this small town seemed to become even more quiet. In particular, the soft sound of the plane tree leaves falling in front of the steps, the distant barking of dogs in the village, and the rustling of the wind, all intermittently emphasized the desolate atmosphere of the silent night in this small town. I have always been indifferent to the autumn wind and autumn rain, rarely experiencing their moving beauty. But this night was different. The autumn night sounds, lamented by sensitive poets and travelers, deeply touched my stubborn heart, perhaps precisely because my mind was constantly dwelling on that selling voice overflowing with desolate charm, and thinking of that pitiful peddler who had to endure hardship for a living in this late night with dew and chilling wind.</p>
<p>Several nights passed like this. I also learned from a child that he was selling sandalwood olives. He even showed me the ones he bought. Judging from their shape, these small, hard things probably didn't have any delicious taste. It also seemed that no one came out to buy them when they heard the hawking. Although I seemed very concerned about this selling voice, I was always limited by habit, and it was usually difficult for me to go out to the entrance to buy snacks from the peddler. Only once, I saw three children surrounding him, and I walked over. A tilted square-framed glass kerosene lamp was placed on one side of the wooden bucket. Inside the wooden bucket was covered with a thick cotton cloth, the color of which was already very dirty and old. The man was squatting next to the wooden bucket, a large hand grabbing a celadon porcelain plate, and scooping downwards, the plate revealing a few dark green olives. A few tender little hands quickly reached out to grab and pick, mixed with the noise of arguing over choosing the smaller or larger ones. After the children dispersed, the man didn't even raise his head, and carried the wooden bucket forward again. I could only stand on the side, silently watching his slightly hunched back, lifting his two thin legs and moving with difficulty in the light of the fire, the three different selling voices filled with desolate charm, again spreading with the night wind on the dark village path...</p>
<p>Until now, every night before the wonton vendor passes by, I can hear this desolate selling voice. Every time I face the lamp alone, the wind and dew are bleak outside, and the dog barks are faint, I can't help but close my book and sigh silently, feeling that the night in this small town is even more terrifyingly lonely.</p>
<h3>Autumn Feelings</h3>
<p>— Xiu Si</p>
<p>The time when I first had knowledge and feeling about autumn was when I was a primary school student and read Ouyang Xiu's "Ode to the Sound of Autumn." At that time, my understanding of autumn was very simple: the weather is cool, there is a bright Mid-Autumn Festival moon, and there is a southeast wind to fly kites. The climate in the south is close to the tropics. Even in autumn, the trees don't necessarily wither. The beautiful scenery of falling leaves is rarely seen. Therefore, my feeling about autumn is a pleasant mood. What's more, there is the joy of flying kites. (When I came to the north, I had a real feeling about flying kites in the spring, as the primary school textbooks said, "grassy fields, flying kites." In my hometown, I scolded the textbook editors for talking nonsense).</p>
<p>It is said that literati lament autumn because of their suffering and emotions. Although I am also very sensitive, I have not felt sad about autumn in my life. Moreover, in my life, I actually feel happy and joyful about the cool, neither cold nor hot autumn weather.</p>
<p>Others lament autumn, but I love and enjoy it.</p>
<p>My love for autumn when I was young was naturally because I could fly kites. And the kites we flew in the south, in addition to people, birds, insects, and fish, also included a kind that was like a fighter plane, which could fight in the sky. I liked to fly this kind of fighting kite the most. The shape is similar to Japanese kites, but the string used for flying is coated with glass powder using glue, and the manufacturing method is different from others. It can be manipulated freely up and down, left and right in the air. It is not a problem to chase or run away. I feel like I am directing an airplane with radio. It's really interesting. If you feel jealous of those kites that can make sounds, or kites that are not beautiful, no matter how far away she is, if you release your own, turn a somersault, and put your string on her string, release it as much as possible, and use the friction of the glass powder on the string, you will cut her string. Charging left and right, it is simply the prince of the sky. If you unfortunately encounter someone else's fighting kite, then you cannot dominate, and you have to have a duel to the death. When it comes to this duel, it depends on whose glass line is long. The short one loses, which is an irresistible thing. This kind of fighting kite is also like a submarine. The person flying it is not on the grassy field, but standing on their own roof. No one understands where it came from. If the line is long, people several miles away are even more baffled. It's been ten years since I returned to my hometown. I wonder how the children are fighting in the sky in this hometown where the southeast wind is tight! When reading "Dream of the Red Chamber," I found the behavior of the young masters and young ladies in the Grand View Garden to fly kites to drive away bad luck ridiculous; but I developed a combative personality when I was young. I think that should be the reason why I have been running into walls everywhere and achieved nothing over the years?</p>
<p>I don't like the Mid-Autumn Festival moon. But I like to fly my kite on that night when the moonlight is like a painting. Flying a kite at night is really boring without the moon; with the moon, you can see the kite running with the white clouds, and the interest is endless. Some people like to fly kites in the dark night, and listen to its sound. I don't like this. What's the point of only hearing the sound without seeing my kite in the sky? In fact, what I don't like is still because it is dark. Although I am jealous when I hear other people's kites making sounds, I don't know where the kites are, so I can't fly my fighting kites out to show off. Mid-Autumn Festival night is different. The moonlight is like day. Whether it's fighting with people or attacking everyone, you can see everything clearly.</p>
<p>After coming to the north, my understanding and feeling of autumn are different again. The time when my soul was immersed in the embrace of autumn was during the period when I was studying at the foot of Snake Mountain; since I have been rushing around in the world, I have not had that kind of mood. Looking back now, it feels like I am immersed in a dream.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Our school had a small park next door, which was the site of Zhang Zhidong's Holding Ice Hall. It was a natural phenomenon for the park to be next to the school, becoming a place for students to stroll and relax. Moreover, it was quiet and secluded, with few tourists, and it also became a place for male and female students to talk about love. In the spring, the park was full of peach blossoms. Upon entering, it was as beautiful as the red glow on the horizon, tempting people to ignite the flames of youth. There were more tourists; in the autumn, the white poplars rustled and moaned at the treetops, and fallen leaves flew all over the ground. The tourists disappeared, and it became the exclusive world of our students. In particular, I liked to walk and sit in the park the most. After walking through the peach tree forest, up a few stone steps, turning behind a large hall with its doors tightly closed, and then going deeper, there were white poplar trees planted all over the hillside under the mountain. Various kinds of chrysanthemums were planted around the thatched pavilion. As long as you sat in the thatched pavilion, your ears could hear the symphony of the white poplars, your eyes could appreciate the chrysanthemums competing to bloom, and you could also look at the white clouds flying in the blue sky—autumn approached you with a fresh and elegant posture, immersing you in her gentle and charming embrace.</p>
<p>What's more, sometimes there were girlfriends to talk to, recite poetry, and sing!</p>
<h3>Clouds</h3>
<p>— Wei Mang</p>
<p>Clouds are lovely. Look at their ever-changing forms, their colors changing in an instant, lively and exquisite, floating lightly and soaring high. When the wind rolls them, they are like ten thousand horses galloping; when the rain is heavy, they are like a high tide surging. Sometimes they are so delicate, and sometimes they are so magnificent!</p>
<p>Clouds change with the seasons: in spring, they are light and delicate, as tender as a young girl; in summer, they are thick and bold, like a strong man's complexion; in autumn, they are like a simple young woman, lightly made up; in winter, they are like a stern judge, with a cold face, iron-faced and ruthless. People love the clouds of spring and autumn, perhaps because of their admiration for young girls and young women? And their contempt for the clouds of summer and winter, perhaps that is their contempt for the ugly faces of men?</p>
<p>However, there are also people who admire the clouds of summer, such as when the sun sets in the summer and the colorful clouds hang in the west, how strange and varied the dark clouds are! Like people, like beasts, like flowers and plants, like insects and fish: how interesting children find these ever-changing figurative figures! Even those with manly vigor see the summer clouds bringing thunder, and rolling in the timely rain. A gust of wind sweeps past, and dark clouds pour down large droplets of rain. How majestic the scene is, how much it symbolizes a frantic era!</p>
<p>As for the clouds of winter, it seems that no one has ever praised them. Because they are so gloomy, so miserable, so cold and icy, that they create a depressed and melancholy mood in people! The clouds of winter are full of twilight. They are so dull and lifeless that perhaps old people will sympathize with them. As for young people who are full of vigor, how can they feel the same when they see them? In addition, perhaps scientists, moralists with serious faces, and enforcers with no emotions will praise them?</p>
<p>The love of young people for the clouds of spring is not only on the one hand because of their lightness, exquisiteness, liveliness, and loveliness, but perhaps that is also a sign of love? Look at them, gentle and charming, flying over grassy gardens, and gently swaying in the warm spring breeze, floating past the eyes of lovers, and also floating into the hearts of lovers. In that kind of atmosphere, in that kind of environment, a spring cloud floats leisurely in space, how can young people not be intoxicated in the passion of love?</p>
<p>Artists and poets, however, love the clouds of autumn. In movie shots and in art photographs, the clouds of autumn are often captured in the lens. The reason is that the autumn weather is particularly clear, particularly sunny and high. There is no frantic wind, and even the frenzied and miserable appearance is not seen. At this time, the clouds are light, and the edges are often inlaid with pure white silver. The clouds of autumn are colorful and multi-faceted, like charming babies, and like pure and noble women. How can artists not love them? And how can poets not sing about them?</p>
<p>As for the clouds in the rain and the clouds in the high mountains, they are also objects that people love. Look, when the mountain rain is about to come, the clouds quickly fly across the sky, like the galloping of a myriad of troops, and like the dance of a black goddess. And when the rain comes, watching the wandering clouds in the misty rain, that kind of hazy and leaping posture, and that magical realm covered with a black veil, how fascinating and full of mysterious meaning!</p>
<p>The clouds surrounding the mountainside and the thin clouds floating on the mountain peaks have been repeatedly depicted by painters and writers in their writing. Because a pointed mountain is cut into two sections, or a mountain top is crowned with clouds, the image is indeed beautiful and lovable. And because there is a lot of water vapor and trees in the mountains, floating clouds accumulate and fill everywhere, so the valleys and mountain streams, the treetops and stones, are often visited by light floating clouds, making the mountain scenery different morning and evening, and changing in an instant. The beautiful scenery created by white clouds is certainly not comparable to bald little mountains. Otherwise, how could the cloud scenery of Mount Lu be considered a spectacle by people?</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>After Yuan Muzhi went to Nanjing once, "it is said" that he is going to leave Diantong.</p>
<p>The reason for leaving Diantong, according to Yuan Muzhi's personal propaganda, Bao Ke "Pin", is that he could not stand Sun Shiyi's exclusion.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, Bao Ke "Pin" took that propaganda draft to various newspapers to ask for publication, but as a result, when the newspapers called Diantong to inquire, the colleagues at Diantong were stunned. They said that they did not know that Ai Muzhi had resigned, and even did not know that Yuan Muzhi had the intention to resign.</p>
<p>If Yuan Muzhi really leaves Diantong, (in fact, he will never do so, this is clever propaganda, and also a trick of borrowing a knife to kill,) some say he will go to Japan, (it is said that boss Ma Dejian once said this. "If Muzhi goes to Japan, all expenses will be borne by him.") Some also say he will join Mingxing.</p>
<p>Joining Mingxing is unlikely, because we know that Mingxing already has Ying Yunwei there.</p>
<p>Some people wonder why Muzhi's relationship with his friends is so bad? Apart from Muzhi himself, probably only Zhao Bangfeng and Bao Ke knows.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Moment</h3>
<p>— Da Shanghai Movie Review</p>
<h3>A Little Record of the Imperial Commissioner's Photography</h3>
<p>That evening, the third movie show had already ended, but the upstairs of the Jin Cheng was still bustling with noise. It turned out that amateur actors were preparing to take costume stills of "Imperial Commissioner."</p>
<p>The actors were excitedly and playfully teasing each other, some were getting their hair permed, and some were trying on costumes. Most were lively and full of youthful energy. Only the two masters, Yang Jimin and Xin Hanwen, calmly handled their tools, one setting up the lights and adjusting the camera on the stage, and the other organizing makeup and rushing to make County Magistrate Gu Eryi's headgear upstairs.</p>
<p>Yin Xiucen and 　Mang were originally the Laurel and Hardy of the script. Lao Yin even thickened his nose on his big face, making him even more funny.</p>
<p>Shi Chao's makeup simply had a complete Russian flavor. That mustache, those dark circles around his eyes, that nose - on Avenue Joffre, one could often encounter people like him that night.</p>
<p>Lao Xin almost wanted to display his lifelong energy that night. There were really too many actors. Lao Xin carefully portrayed each actor's personality and features with oil paint and old brushes with great confidence.</p>
<p>Lao Yang initially had his wife helping him, but later it got late, so he was left to work alone. The director, Zhang Min, was a nice guy, lying under the stage directing the actors' poses.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Zheng Junli's makeup was the most successful, with almost the demeanor of Rasputin. Gu Eryi's appearance was the funniest. His stomach was stuffed with pillows to be almost as big as the fat guy Gu Xiucen, and he wore a newly made headgear on his head, with a round nose. As soon as he walked out of the dressing room, everyone was surprised and didn't recognize him.</p>
<p>That day, Jin Shan's makeup was really beautiful. His military uniform was straight, his face was covered with No. 2 oil paint, and he played with a monocle in his hand, truly a dandy young master.</p>
<p>Finally, Wang Ying and Ye Luxi went to be photographed. It was almost dawn. When Wang Ying walked off the stage, Lao Yang was sleeping on the sofa. Miss Wang urged, "Yang Little Sheep, hurry up and get up and take pictures with me! Oh, he's asleep, poor thing." Lao Yang, while organizing the dry plates, said, "Working so hard, taking photos all night, this is really the first time in my life."</p>

<h3>The United States Expands Automotive Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Investing a Huge Sum of 100 Million Dollars</p>
<p>According to news from Detroit, the heart of the American automobile industry, major American automobile giants are now planning a grand and effective expansion plan, with the money they plan to spend reportedly reaching US$100,000,000. This is truly a considerable amount. Since 1919, until the recent years of economic decline, almost all industries were shrouded in the gloomy mist of depression. Not to mention an investment of such a huge amount, it is an unprecedented initiative in various industries since 1919. There are also many manufacturers that have been hit hard by the economy and have become unable to recover.</p>
<p>The aforementioned US$100,000,000 includes the total amount of funds earmarked in the expansion plans of major automobile factories. The majority of this amount is for: (1) the design and manufacture of new car models. This cost is not small, because each factory designs and manufactures new models every year. At this time, everyone is very competitive, and factories do not hesitate to spend a lot of money and recruit talent to do this important work. Now that autumn is over and winter has begun, it is the important season for each factory to compete and work hard to manufacture new car models. Several leading car factories have completed the manufacture of sample cars for the 1936 model year. Starting next month, they will be given to distributors for early viewing, as an aid in sales planning. It is said that there will be a preview exhibition in New York on November 2 for this purpose. Because of the manufacture of new car models, the factory's equipment and work will also be expanded and improved accordingly, naturally requiring a large amount of money to cope with.</p>
<p>(2) Restoring factories that have been closed. Many of the factories of major automobile manufacturers have been temporarily suspended in recent years due to the impact of market decline and economic shocks, resulting in contraction. Now that there is a glimmer of improvement in the market, and 1936 is just around the corner, everyone is excitedly focusing their efforts on work. As a result, several factories that have been closed for many years are planning to resume operations and start work again. This matter, in fact, will naturally cost a lot of money, such as purchasing tools, repairing factory buildings, and hiring workers, all of which require funds. Although the amount of $100,000,000 is large, with these two major expenditures, there is not much left.</p>
<p>This large investment of 100 million dollars is, needless to say, one of the largest expenditures of the two major giants in the American automobile industry - General Motors and Ford. The investment amount already planned by General Motors is US$50,000,000, and the factory expansion cost already announced by Ford is US$27,000,000. Some points in this plan are already underway. In addition, several million dollars will be used to purchase new tools to prepare for the manufacture of 1936 model cars.</p>
<p>People in the automobile industry have long said that they are, on the one hand, the first to be aware of economic panic, and on the other hand, the vanguard of resuming work. Therefore, in the years when the world economic recession struck, the automobile industry also suffered early, and now, it seems that there is a glimmer of recovery, so the automobile industry also has a sign of gradual prosperity. The weakest point of automobile buyers' purchasing power in recent years was in 1932. During this period, various factories made great efforts to tighten their belts, and all unnecessary expenditures were reduced in production. Therefore, the replacement and addition of tools and other items were also postponed. However, at the end of the year, looking at the balance sheet after the accounts were settled, it was still a loss. (Yu)</p>
<h3>The Development History of Diesel Engines for Automobiles (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yisheng</p>
<p>Because of the excellent performance of diesel engines, various agricultural tractors are now mostly equipped with them. According to experience, the car oil consumed by a diesel engine tractor per day is less than the driver's daily food expenses.</p>
<p>Diesel engines have also made amazing developments in other various uses. Cranes, excavators, rock crushers, and air conditioners - more than 20 manufacturers are preparing to use diesel engines as the power source for their products. On the water, we can see that all kinds of ships, large and small, are equipped with diesel engines. Large passenger ships such as the Augustus, more than 700 feet long and with a displacement of 30,000 tons, which travel between Europe and the United States, are also equipped with diesel propulsion engines. Secondly, ships such as the Georgic and Britannic of the British Cunard Company, with a displacement of 27,000 tons each, are also equipped with diesel engines. Currently, almost 90% of oil tankers in the world are equipped with diesel engines.</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Water and Electricity Plant has completely switched to diesel engines, and this is even more the case in cities in Europe and the United States. The large locks of the Panama Canal also use diesel engines to open and close. The crude oil gushing out of the mines is also transported in thousand-mile-long pipelines by using diesel engines to turn pumps to pour and transport it.</p>
<p>Currently, diesel engine manufacturers in Europe and the United States are realizing that this engine is becoming increasingly perfect and are engaged in standard manufacturing, which will reduce costs in the future on the one hand, and facilitate assembly on the other.</p>
<p>In aviation, the advantages of diesel engines are also very obvious. (1) Because of the economy of fuel consumption, it can carry more valuable weight. (2) Heavy oil is not easy to burn, which provides a major safety guarantee. (3) Gasoline engines are most prone to problems with spark plugs and carburetors, which diesel engines do not have. A few years ago, Packard Motor Car Company created a diesel aircraft engine with 225 horsepower and weighing 510 pounds, which was the first diesel engine for aircraft. Currently, various European and American powers are engaged in researching the structure of aircraft diesel engines, so that once the electrical death ray is completed, the electrical equipment used by gasoline engines will lose its effectiveness. Diesel engines, however, have no connection with electricity and cannot be affected by the death ray. Therefore, France is currently offering a reward of 1 million francs to anyone who can invent a diesel engine for aircraft that can be installed on a fighter and has the same speed as a gasoline engine.</p>
<p>Crossing the French border, we can see that the German Lurdentze Aviation Company is engaged in installing diesel engines on its transport aircraft. This aircraft will be the bomber in future wars. In a recent test flight, a Chumot-type diesel engine manufactured by a Yonggu factory could generate 650 horsepower at an altitude of 11,400 feet. Its weight per horsepower was 2.6 pounds. In addition, various factories such as British Sunlight, Italian Fiat, and French Claire also have commendable results in the testing of diesel aircraft engines.</p>
<p>Currently, a factory in the western United States has begun manufacturing a large diesel engine for aircraft. It is an inverted V-type twelve-cylinder water-cooled engine. Its planner is a Belgian engineer. Its horsepower can reach 1,200 horsepower.</p>
