<p>時評</p>
<h3>英美日關心中之遠東問題　有</h3>
<p>自法國法蘭亭和拉代爾携手西行舉行英法間倫敦談話以來。英國外交方針。似已集全力於歐洲大陸問題之措置。然同時對於遠東問題之盤根錯節。亦未嘗一日忘懷。蓋以期間固有密切之關聯在也前日東京日報載日外相答日議員之質問。謂「目前世界之狀况。英日同盟之可能。値得政府考慮。」其爲此言。果爲日方片面之宣傳乎。抑己能深切了解英人之内幕與眞意乎。固非吾人所能知。而倫敦之下議院議員於質問在華航業安全時。亦以遠東局勢爲慮。已可見英人對於遠東問題之關切矣。</p>
<p>夫遠東今日已成爲列强競爭之中心。關係之錯綜。不可究詰。利害最爲關切者。莫英人若。而態度最爲猶移不定者。亦莫英人若。蓋彼於遠東向擁有廣大之經濟利益。自太平洋以至印度洋。皆屬於彼之勢力圈。昔日之聯日以抗帝俄。與戰後之廢盟以近美。胥視英人在遠東地位之鞏固與否爲轉移。今則對俄形勢已非昔比。欲與日重修舊好。不免有種種顧慮。欲與美聯合一致。亦有所障礙。此所以英人對於遠東問題。躊躇徬徨而不决耳。</p>
<p>然英國爲自身利害計。遠東方面之與英競爭市塲最烈者首推日本。觀於印度荷蘭暹羅等處。無一不見日本經濟勢力之膨脹。自足以寒英人之心。而减少其急切從事於聯日之興味。試觀近日英當局。一方面防止遠東民族要求利益之高張。改革印度憲法。以加强對印之統治。一方面急急修繕遠東之軍事根據地。與整理航空軍備。均足見其關心遠東利益之密切。昨哈瓦斯倫敦電稱。日海相大角氏發表宣言。擬向英美兩國要求停止或限制新加坡海軍根據地。曁夏威夷羣島之防禦工事。此間人士。認爲試探性質。官廳則或以爲可置不理。或以爲碍難接受。而據國民社華盛頓電。美國方面對此消息。各報亦紛紛加以批評。某報謂「日報（卽載日海相宣言之日報）所據理由。全屬錯誤。該報以爲夏威夷及新加坡均在華盛頓條約範圍以内。實則上項根據地及阿拉斯加。均有特殊規定。不受該約限制。」又謂「華盛頓條約規定。英美得各在夏威夷及新加坡自由設防。」可見此遠東地位。非特英國關心。美國亦甚注意兩國之見解與地位。固甚相同者也。</p>
<p>更有一點可注意者。卽英美因地位與見解之相同。而有進一步謀合作之傾向是也。國民社紐約電。述李頓爵士在政治敎育聯合會演說三强海軍談話問題時。認遠東問題。爲重要政治問題之一。大意謂「英美兩大國人民。均應有坦直之討論。欲除去妨害世界和平之危機。英美合作。實爲不可少之舉。」後更謂「英美兩國應付此問題。先應掃除懷疑心理。以英國而言。英日友誼使英人同情於日本之經濟狀况。遂令美人對於英國之言行。表示懷疑。以美國而言。英國爲國聯之會員國。美國則否。遂使英人不能信任美國之意嚮。並對於美人願負解决遠東問題至何程度。亦致疑懼。但一切猜忌。實無根據。因兩國所負義務。均受條約之約束也。」此數語更爲扼要。李頓爵士能將英美兩方懷疑之心理。明白揭出。則此心理上之誤會。今後能完全消釋者。合作自易於進行。而對於英日復盟之情勢。則相距愈遠。據今日國民社芝加哥電稱。日本駐美大使齋藤。今日向外交關係恊會發表演說。謂日本之遠東政策。旨在防制西方之政治及軍事勢力侵略中國。可見日本之遠東政策。尙堅持如故。與英美絶不相容者。此就最近各方面對於遠東情勢之表示觀察如此。以後如何變化。吾人又烏能知之。</p>
<h3>美政府要求撥欵太平洋沿岸設防</h3>
<p>夏威夷建空軍根據地</p>
<p>日存猜疑庸人徒自擾</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日消息、預算局已建議國會、撥欵美金一千一百萬元、在夏威夷新建主要空軍根據地一所、此項建議、係在陸軍正式預算之外、而在羅斯福總統公共建築案三萬萬元之内、再政府亦向衆院度　支委員會建議、撥欵二百萬元在各地添築沿海空防、據稱、此欵將作夏威夷及阿拉斯加二地添置高射砲之用、尙有一項提議則爲八百萬元、在各地陸軍駐處添建營房、大槪衆院度支委員會不久卽能核凖、此數建議所需欵項、則在聯邦經常建築費中抽撥、而不在四十萬萬元臨時救濟費之内、度支委員會茲已將此數建議送交衆院陸軍委員會參考、該委員　會與總參謀長麥加德等討論一過、卽已核准、至於提案内容則嚴守秘密、惟據悉夏威夷空軍根據地一案之一部份欵項、將建築大飛艇根據地一所、蓋有人以爲此項飛機塲、亦可作爲太平洋飛艇商航之用云、衆院陸軍委員會主席麥斯璜稱、夏威夷空軍根據地之建築、三四年前卽已核准、惟以缺乏欵項未曾實行、此次預算局之建議、毫無軍事方面侵略他人之意、而與在珍珠港紐約金門等處設防完全相同、如他國另生猜疑之心、則將成爲絶大之誤會云、麥氏此語、蓋指日本方面之猜想、同時衆院海軍委員會主席文生亦發表公共建築費三萬萬元、其中一部份將撥　付珍珠港及太平洋沿岸各處海軍根據地之建築工程、大西洋沿岸所需則將　甚爲微幾云、再衆議員韋如斯亦稱、彼所建議在美國重要地點十處、添建空軍根據地之一案、將促其早日通過云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>美國積極擴充空軍實力</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據陸軍部今日所發消息、總部空軍之第一次試騐、將於三月初舉行、卽以陸軍轟炸機十架飛往巴拿馬、中途降落一次、同時高級陸軍長官如總參謀長麥加德等咸稱、陸軍除在預算案中規定者外、尙亟需新機八百八十架、始能使空軍實力達到預計中二三二零架之限度、至此數中之一千架、則應屬總部空軍云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>齋藤又鼓簧舌</h3>
<p>在滿行動稱自衛</p>
<p>稱霸野心暴露無遺</p>
<p>芝加哥　日本駐美大使齋藤今日向外交關係恊會發表演說稱、日本之遠東政策、旨在防制西方之政治及軍事勢力侵略中國云、齋藤鄭重指出現在蘇俄方面之危險、謂蘇俄現已囊括外蒙古、卽新疆似亦入於蘇俄之勢力範圍、故拒絶西方國家增建海軍根據地、如蘇俄之旅順根據地、及德國之青島根據地、均與該項政策有關、在中國狀况不致引起外國覬覦之前、日本實有準備應付任何事變之必要、遠在一九二五年之時、蘇俄卽已破壞撲資茅斯和約、激勵華人排外、結果使日人不得不在滿洲採取自衛行動齋藤繼重提中國之治外法權問題、謂日本甚願中國政府能給與外人以充分之保護、俾外國政府能早日撤回駐華軍隊、且關於此點、吾人深與中國表示同情、因吾人與西方國家互通欵曲之初、亦備受治外法權之痛苦云（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本第一艦隊舉行大檢閱</h3>
<p>大分　第一艦隊之陸空聯合閱兵禮、今日下午一時半在佐伯航空隊陸上飛機塲盛大舉行、陸地爲第一艦隊之陸戰隊、天空爲航空隊、各行分列式、由高橋司令長官檢閱、至下午二時半告終、（十日電通電）</p>
<h3>法大型飛機凖備飛航南美</h3>

<h3>各國要人演說籲請國際合作</h3>
<p>英法團結志在弭戰</p>
<p>兩國外長同聲相應</p>
<p>斯末資主英美提携</p>
<p>戈林要求武裝和平</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日世界各處有主要人物演說增進和平事、其最堪注意者、爲普魯士總理戈林將軍正式遊特里斯登時向羣衆所發之演說、内有「重整軍備之德國、實爲歐洲和平最佳之保障、英國高級軍官近曾問德國對於和平將有何作爲、余答「德國所能爲最大之事、厥爲重整軍備」、及劍失則和平亦失」等言、</p>
<p>其次動人之演說、爲南非聯邦斯末資將軍對南非國際事務社所發者、將軍謂英美兩國在太平洋中實際合作、以維持中國土地之完整與將來之和平、實爲關於今日國際事務所能取之最要步驟、苟非美國允對陷侵略者於孤立地位之經濟抵制等事與各國合作、則巴黎和平公約仍將爲人所篤信、大不列顚無論如何、須知在將來任何急要中贊助國聯任何决議、决不致因以引起與美國在大海中之爭鬥、將軍末稱、前美國國務總理史汀生對和平公約所發之宣言、宜加以澄清之功、使成實際政策之基礎、俾縱不爲國聯會員或無被累之擔任者、亦能信賴此種政策云云、</p>
<p>英外相西門昨夜在巴黎英人商會亦發誠懇之長演說、籲請各國合作、以謀增進和平、西門述及英法當軸最近在倫敦談話之成功、切實聲明兩國之工作、並非志在對付任何國、謂「吾人之目的、不在一種有限制的諒解、而在提出建議、以爲有關係各方面自由平等談判之根據、藉以增進各方面之和平與幸福、俾和平之機構可建、並於最穩固最美妙之基礎、如大衆承認吾人乃以此精神而戮力經營、如吾人所邀之各國亦能以此偉大精神與吾人恊商、而各有供獻、則余信在本年中吾人當能對成立政治信任與商業繁榮所依賴之條件、獲一大進步云云、</p>
<p>法總理佛蘭後料發和平之演說、以作同聲之應、謂法英兩國政府已成立精神團結、兩國現對人類和平之願望、提出莊嚴之籲求、兩國第一目的、乃在遏止破壞與暗殺、凡曾參與大戰者、今皆信欲求前途之美善、厥在提倡人道主義、佛氏末謂凡飛渡英吉利海峽者、皆見法英兩國爲同一之天所覆蓋、兩國現不許此天爲死的傳送者云云、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國亟謀促成東歐公約</h3>
<p>擬續與俄小恊約談判</p>
<p>英國態度顯見冷淡</p>
<p>（巴黎）據沃佛報之國外通訊員聲稱、昨日賴伐爾與西門會餐後所談之問題、卽爲如何實現英法宣言中之各點、該通訊員續稱總理佛蘭亭反對召開四國五國或六國會議以解决此等問題、唯主張由尋常外交方式交換意見、或逕召開軍縮會議、該報又謂、假使德國拒絶參加東歐公約、則此一問題、必致成爲主要題目、唯現時佛蘭亭雖急欲蘇俄討論此一問題、但西門自英法倫敦談判之後、對此問題之態度、顯見冷淡、廻聲報對於此點亦加證實、據稱法政府現卽與蘇俄小恊約續開談判、促進東歐公約之實現、同時蘇俄與小恊約亦催迫法國履行去年十二月五日今年正月十八日之成議、務使東歐之成功、早於其他公約、該報又謂法國雖與他國不惜作周詳之磋商、然於磋商期間並不犧牲其在軍事政治上之行動云云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>西門由法返英</h3>
<p>柏林之行官塲否認</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國西門外相、昨日來此參加巴黎英國商會年宴、業於本日偕夫人乘飛機遄返英京、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）西門外相是否將作柏林之行、此說自英法兩國倫敦談話結束後、卽已喧傳一時、德國各報亦似樂於附和此說、據「觀察報」外交記者所知、則外相柏林之行、勢必成爲事實、該報謂「官塲人士對於此事、雖依照慣例採取保留態度、惟現在竟已拒絶否認、此則殊足使人注意者也、當英法兩國宣言書送達德國政府後、英國大使費潑斯爵士、卽向本國政府提出報告、謂德國態度頗表贊同、此層固</p>
<p>議、俾將英法兩國所提出各項問題、加以討論、並謂「召集一般會議、或由外交途徑從事磋商、兩者孰爲較善、一時尙難判斷、總之目前尙在凖備階段中、一俟各國政府對於倫敦宣言書之反響明瞭以來、當可决定較善之辦法」云云（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對英法建議德愼重草覆文</h3>
<p>傳態度尙爲良好</p>
<p>（柏林）英法兩國倫敦宣言公佈之前、曾由各該國駐德大使以其内容通知德國政府、該國政府復文將於星期四五日凖備就緒、交由駐巴黎倫敦兩大使、分頭遞交英法、兩國、其大綱目下想已擬定、此於德國政府活動情形頓告休止一層、可以覘之、頃聞希特勒喉疾因積勞轉劇、業已前往貝許德斯伽登城休憇、卽外交次長洛夫、亦因冬季、運動離開京城、而以整理復文之責委諸外部主管官吏、據本社所知、復文措詞友善、其内容亦屬積極、德國對於英法兩國所建議各節、表示接受、作爲各方面以平等資格自由磋商之基礎、而尤注重平等資格一層、德國對於英法兩國所提議、未必在復文内從長討論、或就該國最所關心之點予以指陳、卽軍備限制公約是也、至天空公約計劃、則德國認其爲軍備平等權利之具體表示、極所贊同、此外德國對於多瑙河公約草案、（卽中歐洲互不干預内政公約）將向注意兩國要求說明、其對於東歐互助公約草案、則不願與蘇聯簽訂此項公約、仍然表示反對、其原因一爲德俄兩國並無毘連疆界、一爲蘇聯疆域橫跨歐亞兩洲、此項公約若果成立、則德國在其利益不受威脅之處、恐受牽涉而有所舉動云、此種立塲、自與德國對波蘭政策曁對日友善、有相當關係、德國各報對於蘇俄頃又從新加以攻擊、似不無蛛絲馬迹可尋、要之、以上所指各項公約草案、欲求其成爲事實、勢非召集國際會議不可、而在召集之前、又必在外交途徑上舉行長時間之談判、藉以籌備一切、此蓋意料中之事也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>專施於華校、乃於驚惶危懼之中、加上一重疑惑、迨本月十八日敎育部長召集各華校代表談話、答各代表所問、亦以此爲言、於是華校當局之疑團乃益加固、對於敎育部此舉、以爲稍欠公平、目前各華校不約而同、紛紛上書國務院長及敎育部長、請收回成命、准各華校照舊設辦强迫班、查上書有黃魂·廣肇·新民等十四校、現正在交涉抗爭中、</p>

<h3>總結賬後鎭江商業槪况</h3>
<p>米糧錢業獲利最豐</p>
<p>北貨油業菜館次之</p>
<p>鎭江通訊、鎭江上年商業、雖承社會經濟衰落之餘、繁榮乏術、而一年來市面狀况、尙克趨於安定、倒閉者僅三數家小店而已、總結束之結果、大致尙稱良好、銀錢業及各門市店家、八日大半均照常開市、茲就調查所得、分述如次、</p>
<p>銀錢業　銀行乘錢莊業衰敗應時崛興、現計有中央·中國·交通·農民·江蘇·上海·中國實業等七家、除中央銀行外、大都均擴充營業、兼做信用放欵、上年營業以上海銀行爲最發達、中交實業次之、但盈餘均不多耳、至錢莊方面、僅有道生元康鼎昶甡記承裕等五家、信用放欵旣不能暢做、匯兌交易復爲銀行所攘奪、於是資力稍充者、咸經營副業、如道生元康鼎昶等三家、或從事於證券之買賣、或販運雜糧北貨以及其他營運、所獲之利、除補助開支外、均盈餘二三萬金不等、甡記承裕則以無此意外收入、遂致賠貼開支、承裕已實行收歇、其他四家均於八日上市、</p>
<p>米糧業　上年米糧價格、因新穀歉收、逐步提高、米價由五六元漲至十餘元、機米廠家遇此機會、無不獲利倍蓰、益以浙閩帆船帮採辦頻仍、行家之營業更見發達、總計行廠數十家之多、除義盛因抛麥致虧於中秋節前倒閉外、實無一虧本者、廠家如阜豐大有源泰豐等、盈餘之數、均在萬金以上、各行廠因討論業規、八日槪未上市、</p>
<p>北貨業　北貨業大同行僅有元生東勤義恒兩號、泰順泰豐和隆大三行、其主要營業爲買賣金針菜花生等北貨、上年秋冬之交、金菜市價大漲、花生生仁亦步好有存貨者、均可獲利、元生東勤義恒資力旣豐、且係自運、故盈餘甚厚、泰順亦稍有盈餘、泰豐和隆大則僅敷開支、結束後隆大因店東去世、已决意收歇、泰豐和亦將更張、其餘數家均無變動、日内卽可照常營業、至舊運河邊小同行十餘家、情形亦稱平善、</p>
<p>綢布業　綢布業在去歲一年間、兩次受展覽會影響、又受國貨公司之牽掣、營業方面冷淡異常、大都虧折者多、綢緞同行中、大成大新兩家、因値新創、虧耗較多、裕康祥泰成平平、裕成因進貨機會頗佳、營業比較發達、獨能盈餘、布店方面除福和祥恒源昌等三數家有批發交易、可以挹注、勉敷開支外、其他門市店、均不見佳、全體綢布店於本月十日後開市、惟有數家、因内部改組、或稍有更張、</p>
<p>油雜貨　江廣業上年洪江油營業機會、不若二十二年之佳、皮白油尾聲尙好、結束成績均皆平常、豆油號因豆油生油在歲底突漲數元、有存貨者悉獲厚利、如德和祥慶生昌等均有盈餘、糖雜貨數家大致均告平善、雖乾泰祥信成兩家曾於歲底倒閉、聞係受客路賬欵拖累、其他各家均於八日照常上市、</p>
<p>木行號　近數年間、木業已現式微之象、大都係受貨價低落影響、去歲上半年、行號情形均不見佳、入秋以後、因上江來源銳减、木價逐步提高、存積稍豐者咸大得其利、號客棚廠盈餘較多、行家亦有餘裕、</p>
<p>其他業　酒醬業因受精鹽及揚州醬菜之抵制、營業均不甚佳、除酒行有盈餘外、其他均不敷開支、京廣貨業則以義隆祥爲最好、其他均有虧折、飯菜館全體均不惡、萬華中華兩樓盈餘獨多、銀樓業因去歲金市平常、營業亦不甚佳、小輪業雖輪流派班、競爭不如昔年之甚、但各公司停擱之輪拖太多、銀利吃重、每月僅攤數班不敷開支、故均有虧折云、（九日）</p>

<h3>對日的兩條綫（一續）林柏生</h3>
<p>讀徐道鄰「中日關係的檢討」書後</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>對日局面之僵持，不易打破，旣然如此，爲敵爲友，還談不到，所以現時中國，不能不準備兩條路：只有這兩條路，舍此别無他途。</p>
<p>第一，堅持與東北四省共存亡的决心，存與俱存，亡與俱亡。上面已經說過，日本之「向大陸進出」是没有止境的，她的目的旣然不只東北，今日失了東北，明日還會失察哈爾，失河北。這種情形正與一隻蝦蟆被殺相似。如果將一隻蝦蟆，斬成數塊，塊塊依然躍躍跳動，割一刀，叫一聲，跳一下，直至刀刀割完部部分解，還不知道早是一嗚呼的了。蝦蟆之死是如此這般的，四十年來，中國之被宰割，也正是如此這般的。我們今日，眼見着這種情形，均之死地，與其苟且偷生終被凌遲而死，何如抖起精神，拼個死活，極壯烈的一戰而死。這是第一條路。</p>
<p>如果我們行這一條路，則我們首先要認定這是一條犧牲的路，下了犧牲的决心，就要「咬定牙齦，不要呌苦，政府不要因爲籌餉不遂，呼喚不應而叫苦，人民不要因爲傾家蕩產顚沛流離而叫苦、兵士不要因爲飢寒無告，接濟不周而呌苦，因爲中國是苦命的中國，中國人是苦命的中國人，苦命是注定的了，我們安排吃苦，不要隨便叫苦。」</p>
<p>其次要認定這是一條求死的路、因爲中國今日眞眞正正的還只是一隻蝦蟆，盡現時全國所有的力量而一戰，已是没有把握，能否集中全國的力量，更是没有把握。我們不要以爲有歐戰時的比利時可以自慰。比例來說，國防上，政治上，經濟上，交通上，社會組織上，比利時比我們强得多，而且，比利時與德國宣戰的時候，俄國，法國已先後對德宣戰了，英國已準備動員了，比利時之對德宣戰，是參戰，不是單獨應戰，我們今日的環境，如何及得比利時。我們也不要以爲有復興的土耳其可以做榜樣。土耳其經過二十年連續不斷的戰爭，賴着地理上國際上的種種關係，遠遠的避到安哥</p>
<p>拉，艱難苦鬭，纔有最後復興的一日，而復興後的土耳其，論起人口已少了三分之一，論起領土更是少了一半了。我們今日能够有避難的地方嗎？能够有長期苦戰的機會嗎？苦戰的結果，假使有一塊小小的土地，建立得一個小小的政府，爲世界亡國史多添一件古董，也算好了，只怕土崩瓦解四分五裂，并此也不可能呢。所以我們下了犧牲的决心，更要抱着求死的念頭，萬萬不可懸着什麽榜樣，胡思亂想。我們不要避難，是要犧牲，我們不要倫生，是要求死，庶幾九死之中，或者可以求得一生。</p>
<p>第二，認定目前的形勢，東北四省决非武力所可收復，如此則惟有照汪蔣屢電所說的，確立一個最低限度，所謂最低限度，即决心不承認僞滿，在最低限度之内，可以忍讓，可以委曲求全，逾乎最低限度，則惟有决裂，惟有犧牲，寧死不辱。。</p>
<p>這個辦法，有三個作用：</p>
<p>其一，在一面極力忍讓的時候，一面要以十二分的努力去做準備的工作，去做充實國力的工作。所謂準備，所謂充實，要手裏切切實實的去做，不要只是口裏空空洞洞的去說，口裏越說得少，心裏越想得多，手裏便越做得多。</p>
<p>其二，以我們中華民族忍讓的態度，犧牲的决心，奮鬭的精神，或者可以感動日本人使之覺悟與中國爲敵，不知與中國爲友，如此庶幾東北四省問題或者可以得到一個和平的解决，以和平的方法達到收復失地的目的。</p>
<p>其三，在一面忍讓一面準備當中，等待國際形勢的推移。這不是希望世界大戰以爲苟且偷生之計。要知道，國力没有充實以前，大戰爆發，中國不但没有參戰的資格，并且没有中立的資格，甚至欲俯首貼耳以仰强者之鼻息，亦有所不能。譬如兩虎相鬭，至少也要一隻豹纔可以說得上舉足輕重，如果是一隻羊，那就只有等候犧牲，第一隻老虎勝了，倒霉的是這隻羊，第二隻老虎勝了，倒霉的還不是這一隻羊，而且，恐怕勝負未决，早已做了餓虎充餓的食糧呢！今日的中國，正是一隻羊，到處是虎，還想偷生嗎？，歷史上的敎訓，也不少了，日俄戰爭，就是一個鐵的前例。</p>
<p>由此可以知道這個辦法，一面要决心犧牲，一面要努力準備，一面要充實國防，一面要運用外交。</p>
<p>何以說一面要决心犧牲，一面要努力準備呢？</p>
<p>因爲要犧牲，所以要準備，有了準備，纔可以說到犧牲。反之，没有犧牲的决心，不配說準備；没有準備的力量，不配說犧牲。再反過來說，有了犧牲的决心，這準備纔有意義，有了準備的力量，這犧牲纔有價値。</p>
<p>因爲（一）國際危機，迫於眉睫，我們不知道能够有多少準備的時機（二）中國是一個被害者，而且是一個積弱者，我們不知道能够有多少準備的可能，（一）中國是一個落後的國家，政治上，經濟上，軍事上，科學上，以至於社會組織上，樣樣都不如人，我們不知能够有多少準備的把握。我們會準備，我們的敵人更會準備，我們準備得一分，我們的敵人便準備到十二分，所以我們不能計及準備到怎樣纔去犧牲，我們只有時時刻刻打算犧牲，時時刻刻努力準備，準備得一分鐘是一分鐘，準備得一點一滴是一點一滴，當一口氣尙存的時候用盡力去準備，到了最低限度的時候，便去犧牲，所準備的越充實，所犧牲的便越有價値，如此努力不斷，奮鬥不懈，纔能够達到救亡圖存之最終目的。</p>
<p>何以說一面要充實國防一面要運用外交呢？</p>
<p>因爲外交没有國防的力量，是無從說起的。譬如做生意，國防好比貨色，外交好比廣告，廣告術中有一句至理名言，大量的廣告，可以招徠生意，也可以斷送生意，因爲如果貨色是好的，自然廣告愈多，生意愈好，如果貨色不好，不是愈宣傳愈倒霉嗎？從前有一個國產烟公司，所出的香烟在銷路最廣的時候，被一個外國烟公司，不費吹毛之力便打倒了。這個外國烟公司每當中國香烟出廠的時候，不惜重資，一批一批的收買了去，把他放入又濕又臭的舊貨倉裏，直等到這些香烟通通霉了，纔拿出來大批的向市面推銷，這時候這種香烟本是十分暢銷的了，越是暢銷，買的人越多，而霉烟的銷流越廣，今天買一包是霉了的，明天買一包，又是霉了的，本來是十分暢銷的超等名烟，爲了這個原故，便蒙了霉烟的惡名。吸烟的人是最講究的，好的烟，呌他不吸不行，壞的烟送他吸也不要，因此凡是上過當的人便一一改吸别的烟，久而久之，這種香烟便絶跡市面了。由此可以見得廣告雖然是招徠生意的無上工具，但廣告的應用要有限度，而且還要有一個必備的條件，就是要貨色好。同一個道理，外交是幫助國防的無上工具，但外交的運用，也要有限度，尤其要有一個必備的條件，就是要有充實的國防。「弱國要外交」是一句鞭策自己的說話，「弱國無外交」却是一個實在的情形。</p>
<p>反之，外交的作用又是萬萬不容忽視的。今年一月八日汪精衛氏在國民政府紀念週演說中有一段如下：</p>
<p>「外交的作用，固然不可估得太高，却也不可估得太低。譬如國防有了相當的力量，則外交的作用，至少可有以下兩點：一是消極的，換句話說，便是减少敵國。例如俾斯麥，計劃與丹麥開仗，先設法使奥國不參加，與奥國開仗，先設法使法國不參加，與法國開仗，先設法使奥國不參加，因爲當時普國的兵力，對付一敵國則相當，有勝利的可能，對付兩敵國則不足，必然要失敗，對付一敵國，固然需要國防的武力，如果没有，根本談不上。但是不使有兩敵國發生，則要靠外交的運用了，所以俾斯麥時代，德國每戰必勝，與歐戰時代德國的慘敗，遙遙相較，便可知道外交關係之大了。二是積極的，換句話說，便是增加與國。例如法國自普法戰爭以後，無論在那一方面是不足與法國爲敵的，最大的原因，德國的人口，有七千多萬，法的人口，只三千多萬，須知道兩國相對，一個人口多而又貧又弱又愚，一個人口少而又富又强又智，那麽，人口多的受制於人口少的是可恥的，因爲誰呌你又貧又弱又愚呢，至於富强智相等，而人口不同，衆寡不敵，那不但無可恥，而且可得人類之同情的。法國就衆寡上遠遠不敵德國，隨時有被滅亡之恐懼，所以法國除了充實國防的武力之外，還注意於外交，先和俄國同盟，後和英國恊商，再後並且得意國美國的加入，便居然戰勝了德國，自然，法國如果没有相當的國防的武力，無論俄英意美，都不會加入與他共同作戰的，但若是只有了國防的武力而没有外交，那也没有勝利的希望，外交的效用，於此又可見了。</p>
<p>由此說來，外交之價値，可以想見，因爲有了對付敵國的兵力，而濟以外交則能使對方减少一國以上的兵力，或能使自己增加一國以上的兵力，何怪乎以外交與軍事並重呢？所以充實國防與運用外交，兩者相依，如輔軍，如唇齒，如鳥之兩翼，相須而行，缺一不可。</p>
<p>外交是必要的，無論準備和人做敵人，或和人做朋友，皆需要很活潑的善用外交，能够和人做朋友，纔能够和人做敵人，反之，不能够和人做朋友，更不配和人做敵人。</p>
<p>國防也是必要的，無論準備和人做敵人或和人做朋友，皆需要有相當的武力，能够和人做敵人，纔能够和人做朋友，反之，不能够和人做敵人，連和人做朋友也不配」。</p>
<p>以上所說，一條是求死的路，一條是忍辱圖存的路。無論走那一條路，都要挨得苦，忍得痛。世界上收復失地的前例有用武力的，也有用科平方法的，也都要挨得苦，忍得痛。以武力收復失地的，如法國，普法戰爭之後，守着那句「心裏常常想着，口裏不要說着」的格言，臥薪嘗膽，四十年如一日，還要打了整整四個年頭纔能够收復阿爾薩斯羅崙兩省。武力收復失地，談何容易。以和平方法收復失地的，如德國，歐戰之後，忍氣呑聲，埋頭苦幹，嘗盡艱辛，受盡挫折，抖起全國的精神，直至今日纔由公民投票，有收復薩爾的希望，而能否安然接收，還要看强者的面色。以和平方法收復失地，又是談何容易。我們還要知道普法之役，法國是經過一塲壯烈的戰爭，纔講和的，講和之後，還有雪恥的力量。歐戰之役，德國也是經過一塲壯烈的戰爭，纔講和的，講和之後，還能保持其主權之獨立，還能留存着一點國家民族的精神。我們呢，事實上與戰敗國一樣，形式上連一個戰敗國也不如。前途之艱苦，也就可想而見了。</p>
<p>如果有人問，我們對日究竟做朋友呢？做敵人呢？則我們可以答道：</p>
<p>如果行第一條路，先要有求死的勇氣和犧牲的决心，均之死也，與其忍辱而死，不如不辱而死，爲敵爲友，在所弗計。</p>
<p>如果行第二條路，不但要有犧牲的决心，還要有準備的毅力，没有力量，爲敵爲友，根本談不上。</p>
<p>我們對於對日問題的看法如此，走那一條路綫呢？惟在國民之自擇。（未完）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>照慣吃口紅的怡紅公子說：「女人是水做的，男子是泥做的」。那末泥遇到水就容易溶化，水遇到泥就容易被汚。由此類推，固無怪現代社會，青年男子容易被女人迷惑，未滿十六歲的小姑娘，容易被男子汚辱。怡紅公子的口頭禪，竟成了千古不滅男女間的一種罪惡語。畢竟慣施愛情的專家，道出一句話，較之普通人却另有一種見地。</p>
<p>— （徐小庭）</p>
<p>天氣冷了。熱水袋驕傲地對着扇子笑道：「你昔日的威風何在？這番你也失時了」。扇子一聽，陰刺刺地也笑着答道：「你不要擺足架子，仗勢欺人。到了來年夏令，你又怎麽樣呢」？熱水袋無詞可對。凡是人，何嘗不如此。富貴貧賤，循環無已，俗語所謂，六十年風水輪流轉啊。</p>

<h3>熊毛新婚瑣話</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>結婚本是尋常事，用不着大驚小怪的，然昨日態毛之婚，引起了海上羣衆的注目，眞是太「那個」了。熊希齡氏過去一度握政治的權威，晚年復致力於慈幼事業，名聞中外的北平香山慈幼院，便是他手創的勛績。毛彥文女士現任大學敎授，是婦女界的先知先覺者而今兩姓聯姻，恰是老夫六六，新妻三三；白髮雙雙，紅顏對對；此此所以够人樂趣婆娑，傳爲佳話。在國内，白髮紅顏相結合，確是稀罕的，要如歐美各國，那就不成爲奇聞。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>熊氏不但無暮氣，而且壯志煥發，大有「老當益壯」的神情。近遵新夫人之囑，竟把廿年蓄養的長鬚，付諸并州，當然難免舊社會上的疵議；但我却佩服他的思想，是站在時代的前面，不顧一切封建殘餘的觀念，與流俗不澈底的見解。這副精神，比胡適之稱贊蔣夢麟娶陶曾穀時的所謂「勇氣」，更有意義。（熊是續絃·蔣是重婚。）我嘗對世間標榜獨身主義者抱惻隱之心，自熊氏娶毛以後，大可喚醒一般的曠夫怨女，爲民族前途着想，本記者有厚望焉。</p>
<p>×　×　×　×</p>
<p>我與毛女士爲素稔，間嘗談及中國今日的敎育問題，婦女運動，以至於新聞事業，深佩伊過人的思想與卓越的學識。而今嫁得如意郎君，甚望於相夫育子之餘，爲敎育與慈幼事業多多貢獻，這纔是先覺女子的天職。一天我自眞如歸，適巧與毛女士同車，伊說從小喜歡閱報，自小學而中學，大學，以至留美期間，廿年來爲申報的老讀者，這也値得爲諸君報告。</p>
<h3>簽名册</h3>
<p>— 史濟宏</p>
<p>近來在都市年青人的隊伍裏，很盛行着一種用各色洋紙硬面裝訂的簽名册，封面上燙着一個金的Ａutograph，至少的値四五角錢，那較大而皮面較精緻的，得値上好幾塊大洋咧！</p>
<p>有這種簽名册的人，凡是碰到和他有一面之緣者，都有資格被請簽一個名，寫幾個字，不論一個二個都好，就是洋洋一大段的寫它一二頁也好；更有人除了寫上幾字之外，再錦上添花，畫幾個人物或其他美麗的圖畫和本人的照片的，這將使那一本册子的原主受寵若驚，感激得橫一聲謝謝，豎一聲對不住起來，簡直使人受不住。</p>
<p>在這一本簽名册簽滿之後，至少也得經過近百個人的手了，雖則在這薄薄的一册之中，可是各個所題名的，竟可說完全没有一個是相同的，各有各的姿態，各有各的筆姿同思想，從小小的一本簽名册之中，我們便可見到世界上人的一部份的形識不同了：</p>
<p>要是這一本簽名册經過若干年之後，各個當時題名的人，有的已經飛黃騰達，不可一世，有的潦倒一生，再也没有興緻替人家寫簽名册了。而這一本册子的原主人，也必定已經隨着他的個性同環境的影響而變化，决不是當時購備時候的一種情况，也不是那個時候所能預先想像到的。</p>
<p>難怪在年青人的隊伍裏近來盛行着它！它能占卜一個人的將來的命運的。</p>

<h3>當户都姓王</h3>
<p>— （沈瘦若）</p>
<p>「人人要面，樹樹要皮。」所以窮人的死要面子，顯得平常，並不是例外的一件事。</p>
<p>典衣質物，在窮人的心目中，認爲也是失面子的一種事。因此，當户每上典當的門，惟恐人知的不肯說出自己的眞姓名，免得出乖露醜。「當户都姓王」的有趣的故事，於以形成，至今猶然。</p>
<p>浦東各典當當票土當户的姓没有一家不爲姓王的；所以，凡是去當物的，無論趙，錢，孫，李，周，吳，鄭，都被硬派姓王。我因爲好奇，曾經問過當舖裏的朋友，才明白這種歷史。原來從前的當户每當物件的時候，問問他們的姓氏，都不肯實告，順口答說姓王，（這大槪是浦東姓王的多而普通的緣故吧？）當舖先生明知所告不實，也只得照寫王姓。後來因爲常問不出眞姓，就也免掉麻煩，置之不問，索性一槪寫作姓王；久而久之，就此成爲牢不可破的習慣了。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第八回　僻地輕官遠來强項令華廳盛宴外有可憐蟲</p>
<p>他那兩隻眼睛，却偷偷的去看他娘兒倆，究竟怎麽樣？却聽得那女人帶了慘音道：孩了，我們回去罷。月英道：我們還没有見着要用人的老爺太太呢。若是就這樣回去，婆婆要駡我們，舅母也要駡我們的。你站不動了，就坐一會子罷。你身上凉不凉？他母親胡氏道：凉倒是不要緊，只盼佛爺保佑，事情成功了也罷。張介夫遠遠的看去，見他手扶了墻，身子慢慢的向下坐，就坐在墻脚比較高一些的土基上。月英的臉，分明是向着這邊望了來的。可是每當張介夫踱着步子向他那方面走去的時候，他就掉過臉去。介夫是無論如何臉厚，也是無辭可入，只得又踱了兩個圈子，自回房間裏去。看志前屋子裏時，已經没有了人，燈火　得很小，想必程志前已經到前面大餐廳裏去了。走到窗子外，向裏面張望時，只見汽油燈，放出燦爛的銀光，照着滿堂的賓客，圍了一張長到二丈的大餐桌子坐着。只看那桌面上鋪着雪白的桌布，銀光的刀叉，高高的玻璃杯子，層層疊疊的，順了桌沿擺着。男的來賓，有一大半是穿了那平疊整齊的西服，此外也都是綢衣。其中夾坐着幾個女人深紅淺綠的旗袍，配上那雪白的臉子，硃紅的嘴唇，彎曲的頭髮，都是西安市上所少見的。唯其是這樣，也適足以證明這宴會不同平凡。在女人臉上，多半是胭脂粉蒙着，還不足爲奇。這些男人臉上，可是個個人，都帶了十分欣愉着的笑容。程志前也在那裏，却是擠在人排當中，和朋友談笑。（一三○）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>「要是我們的孩子還活着的話，」太后的聲音又和軟起來了。「我想憑他那樣的聰明果敢，必然大有作爲，我們的國家在他那樣一個賢能的人君的統治之下，也必不致如此糟法！······屈指算起來，到今天，他已有五十六歲了。」</p>
<p>原來同治是在公歷一八四七年生的，隔了十四年，他的老子丨咸豐丨便死了，他就在太后的掖護之下，繼承大統；那時他名爲十四歲，其實祗有十三歲零，無怪我們前天在那些古宮裏所見的一襲他在加冕時候穿的龍袍竟是這樣的短小了！</p>
<p>太后雖然勉强還在和我說話，但伊的心上眞是憂鬱極了；而且每當伊在這樣憂鬱的時候，伊的性氣是格外的變得壞了。我們偷眼看伊，眞有一種不能形容的威嚴，敎人見了，不免會驚出一身冷汗來。如其幸而外面一切都很安靜，我們也没有什麽足以觸惱伊的行動，那末伊就會獨自默默地坐上半天或一天，無論什麽人，伊都像不曾在眼裏看見一樣；如其有什麽事情惱了伊，這便不得開交了！不管是怎樣一件無關緊要的小事，伊都不肯干休，必然要大發雷霆，鬧得合宮不安，而且這樣一來，伊一定會把這個人，或這件東西恨到了底，雖隔三年兩載，還是耿耿于心的記着。大槪女人家的怨毒之心終要比男人家來得堅靱持久一些，而太后是尤其不肯輕放人家。（二四○）</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>呵欠與眼淚</h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>（一）呵欠要傳染，呵欠爲什麽緣故而起的呢？從生理學方面說起來，呵欠是深呼吸的一種，因爲呼吸器中樞的血行，變了常態，不知不覺的，起了反射作用。換句話說，因爲精神疲倦，血行變了常態，呵欠後，肺臟中的空氣，爲之一新，就是把酸素較多的空氣，經過了肺臟，吸到血液裏邊，同時全身的筋肉，又爲之緊張，暫時能够調和疲勞的現象，所以呵欠爲人身生活上必不可缺的。簡單的一句話，呵欠是自然的調節呼吸作用，起了全身的反射運動，因此要打呵欠時，倘若怕難爲情，勉强忍耐抑制·那末·旣不能够調和疲勞，而且第二個呵欠仍舊要起來的，最奇的，一個人打了呵欠，附近的人，也要陸續打呵欠，這就是呵欠的傳染。不過呵欠的傳染，與疾病思想等的傳染，是不同的。動　物中惟魚也有呵欠，魚在水中經過五六次的普通呼吸運動後，必定有一次特别動鰓的呵欠，牛馬的呼吸，好像呵欠，其實與人類不同的。（二）眼淚從何來　英語中有「鰐魚的淚」一言，這是譬喻空淚的意味，就是說其人無緣無故的哭泣。傳說棲住墨西哥加里福尼亞荒野地方的蜥蜴，常常溢流了血淚，因爲這蜥蜴，是很和平的，當它受了刺激興奮時候，身體的血液，上昇到頭部，眼臉上所充的血，約有平素的三倍，因此從上眼臉溢出了血。這是與激怒的人，眼臉變了血眼，是同一的道理。然而人類，何以會哭泣呢？這個問題，很値得有趣的研究。照生理學上研究起來，我們的淚，是從上眼臉裏面的幾個細管流出來的，其一部流入下眼臉的小隙中，過了淚　，由淚管在鼻腔流出。所以觸到强烈的香氣，或其他刺激，必要出淚，催促淚腺的分泌，浸濕了眼的結膜，眼内受了淚的濕潤後，眼内就很清潔。大凡哭得厲害時候，鼻腔内也要流出了涕，就是所謂涕淚交流。小兒如身體發生苦痛，或在飢餓時候，就要啼哭，結果眼的血管擴張，同時收縮周圍的筋肉，淚腺起了作用，淚遂分泌異常了。所以小兒稍感覺不愉快，就要滬淚，大人須有深切的感動，才會流淚。動物中的猿象也會流淚而泣的，牛將屠時，一見屠夫持刀向前，淚涔涔而下，這就爲的動物了解人意之故啊。</p>

<h3>麥令勝來不易黑鷹力戰而敗</h3>
<p>結果五二比三四分</p>
<p>最接近時祇差三分</p>
<p>青島黑鷹籃球隊、於昨晚再戰麥令、觀者僅二百餘人、惟比賽頗見精彩、局勢異常緊張、結果黑鷹雖仍以三十四對五十二之比敗北、但全隊表演甚佳、孔廣益之投籃、伸手遠射、十發九中、博得采聲不絶、惜前鋒在敵籃下動作遲慢、後衛人短吃虧不少、否則麥令番將雖强、昨晚欲勝、頗非易事也、該隊明晚最後戰海賊、地點仍在申園籃球房、</p>
<p>麥令逞威　中圈跳球後、黑鷹由兪根香在角底穿挿兩投兩中、	先聲奪人、麥令不甘示弱、山洛克打開紀錄後、一氣呵成八分、兪根香孔廣益接連建樹、追成八對八、是時局勢頗緊張、競爭甚烈、麥令因人長、在籃下大肆活動、使黑鷹守衛招架束手、徒呼負負、比數由十一對八、十七對十、二十三對十二、黑鷹落後愈遠、上半時成二十五對十四、</p>
<p>祇差三分　下半時起、黑鷹努力振作、孔廣益大展身手、幾次遠射、莫不命中、張毓才、丁守譽亦迭有所獲、局勢爲之一振、轉瞬追成二十六對二十九、麥令見機不佳、急要求停戰、但黑鷹之聲勢力興未艾、張毓才兩罰後、青甫又加上一球、打成三十對三十三、此爲全賽比數最接近時期、局勢緊張、觀者呐喊不已、</p>
<p>仍告敗北　無而黑鷹終以實力較差、在此緊要關頭、不能青雲直上、反又見敵熖高熾、長人洛克、瓊生、格力芬、朋比爲奸、屬建奇功、比數扶搖直上、黑鷹招架愈見紊亂、殘局遂不可拾收、最後祗由兪根香投中一球、結果以三十四對五十二慘遭敗北、裁判員樂秀榮、施肇康</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>上海舞台協會第一次公演</h3>
<p>— 白薇</p>
<p>和妹妹們談起：「我也想去金城看戲。」被一個妹妹拖呀扯地，躋進了滿滿的汽車中，賣票處，决定了我是一位遠地詩人底揩油客。</p>
<p>先同幾個姊妹到化妝室走了一趟，驚異這回是大明星和舞台名演員的大總會，不等看戲，就預知這次的演出一定能飽眼福。</p>
<p>幕啓，偉大立體的舞台面，揭示了攝影塲的内容，這齣「水銀燈下」的獨幕劇，初看那些化裝義勇軍的臨時演員、不在熱烈地談抗日，而在輕談的談變愛，殊覺散漫不起勁。但越看越明白劇情底中心不是說戀愛，而是替臨時演員鳴不平，不過借變愛來襯托，辛辣仔細地，繪神繪影地，諷刺了攝影塲底實生活。</p>
<p>「水銀燈下」這個劇本，是作者自寫劇本以來，劃期的進步的產物，並且是開中國自有話劇以來最完美的諷刺劇的第一聲。</p>
<p>加之，袁牧之底沉着優越的表演，萬籟天底緊張靈活的表演，胡萍那樣像煞是一個搭架子的女明星的表演，及全班名演員的努力，使整個的演出最成功。</p>
<p>鄭君里那樣肉麻的談情，未免表得太過火，而欠眞實。</p>
<p>「回春之曲」是以戀愛爲經，以抗日爲緯，作者用圓熟的手法，有力的歌白，寓深意於滑稽之中，寫成這個有聲有色有笑有淚的三幕劇。</p>
<p>第一幕以南洋紅河爲背景，椰林，蘆草，鮮艶的綠光，交錯的暗影，燈光和佈景的美麗堂皇，打破了上海話劇無台的紀錄！</p>
<p>高維漢，（金熖飾）是三個在南洋當敎員的熱血青年中最積極的一個，僑生南洋的梅娘，狂熱地戀着他。一天，他在河邊，遇着好友洪思訓，女友黃碧如，維漢獨悶悶不樂，憂鬱地彈琴，唱着一再會吧，南洋！」他將離開他鍾愛的梅娘，回國來收回東北的失地。</p>
<p>梅娘也來到河濱，聽到維漢譏她已與三水訂婚，她狂躍狂笑。因爲她只痛愛維漢，無奈梅父經商失敗，把梅娘出賣給富商底兒子三水，這時她聽到愛人將回國，又被愛人譏笑她訂了婚，所以笑中帶淚地像瘋狂。</p>
<p>王人美在這一段裏的表演最有力，很能攝取觀衆底魂魄，她用她本來的熱烈，堅强，興奮地描出梅娘是一朶南國底野玫瑰。清歌一曲，也悽惋動聽，她是一位有「力」的演員。</p>
<p>第二幕在傷兵醫院裏，一二八的戰事毁壞了許多熱血戰士底身體，他們躺在床上悲號慘叫着。但爲抵抗而戰的戰爭，並没有毁傷他們底心，他們重傷不能動了，還嚷着：「嬰到前綫去！」叫着：「寗肯死在戰塲上，不願死在病院裏！」</p>
<p>「殺呀，前進呀！」高維漢從手術室慘叫着被抬來，劇情陡然緊張。洪思訓（趙丹飾）從床上掙扎起來去撫摩維漢時，那哀感動人的情節，悲痛悽慘的表演，劇本與演出，都好到感人欲泣，是全戲底高潮，是悲壯精華處。趙丹底演技，能那樣細緻地體帖悲劇的人生，又充滿着熱烈的情調，是最有希望的天才演員。</p>
<p>第三幕是一二八的三週，又逢舊歷年關，洪思訓，黃碧如，高維漢及梅娘，都在從南洋歸國的華僑胡華生（袁牧之飾）家裏。高維漢還是只會喊：「殺呀，前進呀！」的白痴，金熖的白痴做得很好。梅娘對着這末一個失了知覺記憶的白痴非常悲痛，她悲切地對着他唱着歌曲，想使他恢復記憶，認識她是他親愛的梅娘，但他唯一的回答還是：「殺呀，前進呀！」這無情的子彈給與他倆戀愛的悲劇，眞使多情的梅娘斷腸！丨丨王人美郤並没有充分地表到斷腸的苦惱丨丨使觀衆泣笑皆非，這是作者寓深意於滑稽中的絶妙處！</p>
<p>突聞爆竹響，維漢彷彿有了知覺，愛友愛人底狂呼熱誘聲中，他醒覺了。這時，梅洪等該是怎樣高興？歡狂喜躍，來一陣熱閙的大笑，而親他，而擁抱？可惜缺乏了這末一點。趙丹，人美，王瑩，倒鎭靜地望着他，和他說些平淡的過去，使劇情少了一個高潮，直等胡夫人出塲才有單調的笑聲，可惜！</p>
<p>除了這點以外，這個劇本是滿意的。以下還有點似乎要商量的地方，就是丨丨一個三年的白痴，是否會忽然醒來？剛剛醒覺了，是否能那樣勇壯狂熱地再和情敵打起來？他旣然成了三年的白痴，至少他底身體是呆鈍不靈吧，還會那末活潑潑地去打三水，嚇得三水狼狽而逃，作滑稽痛快的收塲嗎？</p>
<p>我願青年當這幕戲是醫麻木病的良藥，不要輕輕地僅以滑稽看過！</p>
<p>話歸本題：丨丨這次公演，能應用歌曲，美麗的佈景和美藝的燈光，是從九一八前後的演劇，僅用硬性的沉悶的劇本，灰色布條的背景，幽暗的燈光，進步出來了。這次，劇本有那末圓熟的技巧，滑稽的笑料，動聽的歌曲，劇本的轉變與成功，算打破了第一個紀錄；許多大明星和無台名演員合作，演出的優秀，算打破了第二個紀錄；燈光的美麗，佈景的偉大，精緻，是打破了第三個紀錄！還有音樂的配合，好看也好聽，可以說是在話劇上「開聲色之美，啓視聽之娛。」</p>
<p>這與十年前日本築地小劇塲演劇相比，有過之，無不及。</p>
<h3>談「鍾伯敬」</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>自從有一個「京派」？文人講「中國新文學的源流」，以爲「五四」以來的新文學運動是繼承明末公安竟陵兩派的文學運動而來，於是公安竟陵在文壇上鬧個不休。尤其是公安三袁裏的袁中郎，你也談，我也談；袁中郎集你也印，我也印；地下有靈，袁中郎眞該笑煞！</p>
<p>老實說，有明一代文人，我最佩服李卓吾。公安袁中郎，竟陵鍾伯敬，都卑卑不足道。不過鍾伯敬爲人不像袁中郎那麽矯揉造作，似乎有眞氣些。比如他在福建提學副使任上，要賣關節便公然賣關節。他想帶小老婆游一回武夷山，恰恰要因丁父憂去職，還是同小老婆遊了山纔走。這在假道學僞君子佔勢的時代，他這種行徑，誰也不肯拿出的，他却敢於拿出，他或許要受李卓吾的一點影響，也未可知。李卓吾遇到禮科給事中張問達的上疏彈劾，他也遇到福建巡撫南居益的上疏彈劾。疏中說他：</p>
<p>百度踰閑，五經掃地。化子衿爲錢樹，桃李堪羞；登駔儈於臯比，門牆成市。公然棄名敎而不顧，甚至承親諱而治遊。疑爲病狂喪心，詎止文人無行。</p>
<p>可見鍾伯敬是和李卓吾，一樣反禮敎的。只是鍾伯敬不曾著書說敎，所以民不曾受到焚書辱身的慘禍。</p>
<p>李卓吾死後，袁宏道作李溫陵傳，大加恭維，自然，在文學上反復古的公安派要恭維在思想上反復古的李卓吾。李卓吾又是一個歡喜評點小說的人，作爲竟陵派的鍾伯敬，經他編訂批評的小說也不少，他和李卓吾，可以稱做小說評點家。盤古誌傳二卷十四則，有夏誌傳四卷十九則，都題竟陵鍾惺伯敬父編輯，篇首都有鍾惺序，日本内閣文庫藏有明刋本。又有商誌傳四卷十二則，有清嘉慶間稽古堂夏商合傳本，也題鍾惺伯敬父編輯。明周游撰開闢衍繹通俗誌傳六卷八十回，有清重刋本，封面也題鍾伯敬先生評。其他傳爲鍾伯敬批評的小說，還有兩漢演議，三國志演議，封神演義，水滸傳等書。我們要知道鍾伯敬是那個時候一個反復古派的重要份子，他動手批評復古派所看不起的小說或許是眞有其事的。</p>
<p>總之，鍾伯敬做人有一點反禮敎的態度，做文有一點反復古的傾向。我今日談到他，並不想說明他和現代新文學運動有什麽聯繫，杜撰一個文統，你捧袁中郎，就算公安派；我談鍾伯敬，就算竟陵派。</p>
<h3>洛口遊記（上）</h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>（雪的原野）</p>
<p>雪還没有溶解，我們便趁着天晴，作郊外的遠足到洛口去。</p>
<p>洛口在黃河邊上：世界大工程之一的黃河鐵橋，也在那裏。</p>
<p>由濟南市去，約十二里，沿路的田野，都蓋着厚厚的白雪，阡陌蹊踁和溝渠，一點也分辨不出來。倘如没有落了葉的褐色楊樹和一些人家的黃土屋壁在近處點綴着，幾乎使人疑惑到了北極那些地方了。天空没一點雲塊，全是蔚藍的，而且比江南的天空還要深色些。太陽照在一望無際的雪野上，白光耀人眼睛，使人不敢正視。陽光却不暖和，坐在車上的人，手指足指均疆痛欲斷。三兩烏鴉，不敢飛在空中，只是歛緊着翅子，息在大路旁邊，車來便飛高兩三尺，略略躱開，車去後，就又不聲不響地落下。</p>
<p>三匹馬掛的載貨敞車，轟轟隆隆地在冰滑的大路走着，不平的坡將人從貨中聳了上去，又落了下來。馬的黑鬃毛，凝上了霜，變成斑白的了，足下隨着蹄子的奔跑，濺射起白粉似的東西。在遠處白皎皎的原野中，一個黑點漸漸大了起來，慢慢地蠕動着，近前一看原是一匹馬拉的轎式車子，黑棉布作壁，還開有一扇玻璃窗子的，丨這大約是到那裏去作客的富裕地主乘的吧，我們這樣想着。</p>
<p>路邊的麽店子，門前放着熱氣蒸騰的饅頭和鍋貼，房簷邊吊掛着一大塊一大塊黑紅色的牛肉，主人伸出戴毛耳朶帽子的頭來，對着過客打了一聲招呼又縮了進去。没有週遭雪的原野，單就看了這些，也覺得北國的情調，是極其濃厚的呵。在屋裏圍爐，在簷下看冰溜，還没有什麽異樣感觸，等到看了雪的原野之後，才深切地覺得此身是在北方了。</p>
<h3>銀丁</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>每天一清早敲木魚的銀丁道士，已死過好多年了。先是銀丁在我們從前念過書的一個小學校當校工的。</p>
<p>把他特寫起來丨</p>
<p>一張蒼黑臉子，粗濃的眉毛，高鼻子，在那副臉上蘊畜着一股强悍氣質，一想起他的臉，有似一個不和氣的軍官模樣。</p>
<p>從小我在故鄕那小學校念書，於是也熟悉了銀丁</p>
<p>他是倔强橫蠻的，我們幾乎從没見過他一次溫和的笑容，除了對學校中校長敎員不抗爭外，其他始終保守他的惡劣脾氣的，生活也老是荒唐無忌；在學校的例假日子，照例成天把精力消磨到賭博裏，爲睹，跟同夥兒打架鬧事，把對手打破頭成爲平常事了，一夥中的伴兒也對他有點吃驚。</p>
<p>撇開賭錢說，他還愛喝酒，偷嫖女人，什麽不安份勁兒，他總不會没份，自家的孩子十來歲了，上了店舖做學徒去，然而他還是打緊的偷女人，爲那股勁兒，跟自家老婆子打架，幾乎每晚上不免的事；他的手段又異乎尋常的凶辣，老婆給他挨打成一身傷，是不知多少次了。</p>
<p>銀丁的錢是那麽糜費完的。</p>
<p>以後，就窮啦！人也累乏，病了。</p>
<p>病後，有一天，兀突地跟校長說自願要走了。這一回眞怪，一出校，就丢了妻，丢了兒子，人像全然換過了一另胎骨似的，留起長髮來，上鎭南一所廟裏邊做看廟去了。</p>
<p>銀丁眞完全變樣子啦！</p>
<p>鎭上賭塲裏，酒排間，從此再没他的影踪。</p>
<p>停了一年，有人跟我說，銀丁在廟裏做道士了，終日深居廟舍，靜坐，念經；吃長素，穿布衣，修行了。並且人是變到安份和氣，不跟什麽人作一句交涉。</p>
<p>聽說有一次，他從前賭塲裏有個仇敵，趕去拍了他兩下臉巴，臉巴上被打得紅起來，他笑笑，没還手。</p>
<p>另外一回，被幾個頑皮孩子把口液吐他，他也没動點武，把吐着的口液自家抹去了。</p>
<p>銀丁的行品，突然變到那麽善良，甚至不抗惡，這事眞要人吃驚。</p>
<p>他懺悔了吧！</p>
<p>又停過三年，他每天一清早上街敲木魚了，晨光曦微中，穿着玄色道袍，盤起的髮髻上，持着一條玉簪子，把大木魚背在頸項裏，背脊上背着佛陀，燃着清香，裝束那麽古香色的。無論雨天，風雪日子，或是炎熱的暑天；兩年半，他從没間斷，打着木魚；那一點永恒的好精神，一個儍子的虔誠，全給鎭上人佩服了。</p>
<p>直到生命結束，他没改樣；死時穿着古香色這衣，抱着笏板，帶着他一顆懺悔的心去了。</p>
<p>銀丁的木魚聲已斷過好多年頭，那一段時期中，世界又經過無數次變化了。這一個儍愚的虔心人，故鄕也没有人再談到他。</p>

<h3>馳名的跳蛙（四）</h3>
<p>— 馬克特溫作立波譯</p>
<p>這人再取了盒子，投了一個長長的，特别的觀察，還給史密呂，很慢地說「呵」他說，「我没有看出他比别的蛙好一點的地方。」</p>
<p>「也許你没有，」史密呂說「也許你懂得蛙，也許你一點也不懂得他們，也許你有過經騐，也許你只是一個外行，不管怎樣，我有了一個主意，我願意賭四十元，賭他能够跳過卡納華拉斯州一切的蛙，」</p>
<p>這人研究了一會，於是和氣而又煩憂的樣子，說，「不過，我在這裏只是一個過客，我找不到什麽蛙：但是如果我有一個蛙，我一定和你賭。」</p>
<p>於是史密呂說：「那好，那好丨丨如果你願意照拂一會我這盒子，我可以去替你找一個蛙來。」這樣，這人拿了這盒子，把他的四十元放在史密呂的一道，坐着等他。</p>

<h3>工商業將何以謀自處</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>自一二八之戰生，上海商塲　　不安之狀，漸至無法遮掩，日益暴露，及去年總結帳，平時所蓄於中而猶未現於外者，死如癰疽之潰破，一發而難制。銀行倒閉，錢莊清理，鈔票擠兌，莊票减色，商店歇業，工廠停工，「地仙」出走，富商攢眉。於是風聲所播，謠諑所至，岌岌危危，洶洶湧湧，「二重年關」之難渡，誠莫有如去年若也。</p>
<p>難渡難渡，而此「年關」亦已安然渡過矣，以往之事不可追，未來之事猶可爲。「種豆得豆，種瓜得瓜」，有今日之果，必有昔日之因，就果以索因，就因以得果，成敗利鈍之由來，可以思過半矣。吾人不必痛論已往，亦不必逆測未來，就事論事，對於方來之事業，深冀各本其經騐，取鑑於以往之失敗，樹立復興之方針。所謂「一日之計在於寅，一年之計在於春」，及此不圖，噬臍無及；始計不善，終貽厥凶。</p>
<p>鑑於以往之失敗，金融界必取更緊縮之手段，必然之勢也。然此固非各業之福，亦豈金融界之利。蓋自外貨不减其輸入，白銀又無從遏制其輸出，籌碼日少，周轉自澀，因是而物價低落，工商疲敝，此亦必然之果也。金融界爲保全自身計，鄭重放欵，即有之，勢必偏重於抵押，以期减少其損失，亦應有之防衛也。但不知通發愈緊縮，物價愈低落，各業愈不振。蓋工商業至少要三副本錢，一副在出售，一副在待售，一副在製造，或轉運中也。今以金融界鄭重放欵之故，欲以一副本錢，經營事業，其不能周轉，灼然可見。循是而造成之局面，爲工商業無由發展，農產物更不値錢，呆滯停頓，束手無爲，以至於「乾㿜窮」。「乾㿜窮」之爲窮，爲窮中之最兇險者，「賣盡用完」，金融界亦何利之有。</p>
<p>金融界所以到此地步，與其謂爲受於工商業者無寗以所受於地產者爲多。商業銀行，彰明較著，應以工商業放欵爲職志。然而數年來，頗有鑒於地產之有利，以爲上海祗有榮盛，不至衰敗，尤其是地產，千穩萬固，遂歆於地皮掮客之言，而承受其押欵，甚至設立地產部，專營其事，盡量投資。及工商不振，房屋空閒，房租積欠，房地產有行無市，欲售無主，欲押無受，欲催贖無應，於是而周轉不靈矣，而脹殺矣，令市面受其波累矣。地產市面，經此一番挫折，市價之跌落，估價之减低，亦意計中事，將跌至可以保持其最小限度之利潤而後止。房租亦必减至一般所能任，空屋有人住，經營房地產者旣知今日買進，明日賣出，高抬價格，蓄意操縱之非計，而憬然悟，幡然悔，出以正常應買賣。金融界亦知地產生意，究非最善之投資，而改弦易轍，確能從其業務上之有之職責圖發展。則今日之困難，安知非所謂剝極而復，否極泰來，異日復興之朕兆歟！然此尙非可以望諸最近之將來。</p>
<p>有謂金融界不能以低利放欵接濟工商業，皆爲存息太高之故，誠然。但存息之高，非出於存户要求，而出於金融界之自動。金融界所以如此高抬存息，無非吸收一般零星小户之存欵，以遂其囊括無遺之計，而便其地產公債投機之企圖，事業經營之運用而已。存息旣貴，欠息自高，工商業旣欲儋荷高貴之拆息，又逢着蕭條不堪之市面，烏得而不虧本。甚至願出高利錢，亦借不到欵項，可見資金匱乏已達絶點，即一般存放生息，亦非高利不可，因之有爲减低存欵利息之說者，以爲惟如此才可以低利接濟工商業，亦惟如此使有錢者不至存積於銀行，散而用諸農村。姑不論利息高昂，有亦爲自然之趨勢，即在如此局面之下，有錢者肯否將錢放到農村去，猶是疑問莫爲叢毆爵，華銀行存息减低至與洋銀行不相上下時，有大宗存欵者，見無可貪圖，仍舊存放到洋銀行去，則金融界所能减低者，祗一般零星存欵，錙銖寸積，洋銀行不欲接受之存户耳。徒負剝削之名，於事無濟。且欲招之使來也，則曰利息如何優厚，及其旣入我庫中，則欲减低存息，此其所爲，雖不致行同「翻戲」，要亦自喪其信用。故利息問題，自有其平準之道在，惜乎我國人祇知搶堤防水，而不能窮源竟委，若金融界有强有力之組織，力足以負調劑之責，則三厘四厘之存息，何嘗不可爲。金融界中迄今無有能負此責任者，而債劵之合息優厚，又爲事實，於是非懸高利，不能吸收存欵，非有存欵，不能便其活動。而旣要應付此存息，自非就利益優厚者經營不可，地產公債標金紗花粉麥，遂爲一般銀行之目的物，而危機深矣。</p>
<p>自銀錢業不安之狀况明，地產跌價之消息盛，有錢者將何去何往，此亦値得注意之一點。將用以經營投資於工商業乎？此固工商業之福也，然而恐不然。將用以散諸農村乎！則前已言之，或有所不肯。然則將何以自處，敢爲之一言，將用以做投機生意。溯自去年下半年以來，金融界中執有債劵者，逢漲即出，故目前之債券，大致已落在「散户」手中，此之所謂「散户」，即積有幾個錢之銀錢業存户也。蓋其計算，與其圖活期存欵之三四厘利息，無寗到證劵交易所買些債劵，套套利收收息之爲愈也。去年已如是，今年恐又甚之，然則銀行存息烏得而不高。</p>
<p>此之爲言，非泛言也。去年各業多虧蝕，惟獨各交易所皆有盈餘，有票面二十元，下半期分股利八元，上下兩期合計有十四元五角者，幾近於一本一利矣。亦有每票面二十五元者，分股利五元，十五元者分一元，（皆指一個半期而言）職員分紅有至三元半者。交易所營業蓬蓬勃勃，與工商業之倒閉相繼，榮枯懸殊，然此正亦上海市塲之本色也，又何足奇。</p>
<p>此後工商業將何以謀自處，自在工商業好自爲之，非業外人不切痛癢之談所能解决。但金融界之出路，仍在與工商業切實謀合作，助其經營，匡其不逮，不當以消極的緊縮爲能事。工商業應抛棄其怨天尤人不自努力之態度，盡力糾正自身内在之缺陷，而謀出路，若以僥倖存心，夸誕爲能，則其失敗可立待。在各界尤其是有職責者，處此時會，力戒奢華，躬行儉樸，少買洋貨，多用國產。以减輕貿易上之逆勢，稍杜貨幣之外洩。在當局應如何統盤籌劃；復興農村，扶助工商，確立切合於國計民生情况之政策，無以剿襲爲得計。固能循名覈實，全體一心，刻苦忍耐，從艱患中求出路，則事業好轉，非不可能也。</p>
<h3>最近上海拆息漲跌之原因</h3>
<p>— 馮維祺</p>
<p>洋厘與銀拆，向爲金融觀察者之寒暑表。自從廢兩改元洋厘固定（其實已中不復存在）與銀拆改爲洋拆後，這一寒暑表，也就不得不跟着改爲洋拆了。雖然年來新式銀行風起雲湧，錢莊勢力日就式微，錢業市塲所開之行市，已漸不能代表整個金融市塲之狀態；但前者的票據交換，因歷史與習慣關係，仍不及後者遠甚，其交換數額僅及後者五分之一；故一般工商業界以及華商銀行，至今大都依然以錢業公會市塲所訂立之拆息爲規準，所以此種拆息之變動，在中國整個金融經濟上，仍無不相當意義</p>
<p>拆息之漲跌，在往時的正常狀態下，即除了政治變亂的特殊情形外，大都是表示國内農工商業之發達與否。因爲農工商業發達，則資金的需要大，而拆借多；拆借多，則拆息在資金供求的定律下，也就隨之而上漲了，反之則反此。即所謂在正比例下變動。這一現象，尤其是在農業上表現得更爲明顯。因爲農業是有季節的，每當農產物登塲（如四、五、六、三個月中絲茶小麥上市，八、九、十、三個月中秋收上市），都市的資金爲購買農產品，都必然大量的流入農村，散入農民手中，使都市的資金頓形激减，籌碼緊縮，而引起拆息之高漲。雖然都市由於運出資金所購進的農產品，不一定全部都是滯留於該都市，做爲不生產的消費，或多或少，或先或後，都必然的要轉口輸往各地或海外，或製成工業品復輸入農村；同樣，農民由於出賣農產品所獲得的現金，也不一定全部都是將牠蓄藏起來，或多或少，或先或後，也都必然的要拿來都購買各種工業日用品（雖不是直接的）。這就是說，流出去的都市資金，終歸是會流回來的。不過在這一流出與流回的過程中，其速度是有緩急之不同的，即流出急，而流回慢；於是這樣反映於都市金融上，便成了一種所謂金融季節。但是往昔這種適應於農產季節的都市金融季節，自從世界經濟恐慌波及中國與中國半殖民地性的長期慢性恐慌涵合，而爆發了現時的空前經濟危機以來，農村比前更加衰落，農產品輸出激减，工業品輸入農村，則旦夕滋長，農民入不敷出，現金一味外流，而甚少流回農村之機會，已被破壞無遺了；同時因外貨之傾銷，以及農村購買力之薄弱，一般工商業也表示極度不振，致使集中於都市的現金苦無出路，而鶩集於標金房地產公債等投機事業。所以近數年來上海的拆息，除去最近數月將爲本文特别提出討論者外，一般都在低下的狀態中。試看下表便可知道。</p>
<p>近四年來上海拆息按月平均表</p>
<p>一月　二月　三月　四月　五月　六月　七月　八月　九月　十月　十一月　十二月</p>
<p>二十年　一三　　一　　二　　二　四　五　七　一一　一八　三三　三七　二八</p>

<p>廿三年　　五　　一　　三　　四　七　七　五　　九　一二　　七　一九</p>
<p>上表中，二十年九月起至二十一年四月止的拆息之所以比較高漲者，是因爲九一八東北事變及一二八上海事變所致，而二十二年十月至十二月之所以比較稍爲高漲者，乃因閩變正在此時發動也。所以這種稍微比較上漲的現象，與其說是經濟的原因，不如說是政治的原因較爲妥當。然而最近數月來，即自去年下半年八月起，由微微的向上，而突漲至十二月二十八，三十兩日幾至頂盤的六角，及最近又縮回一角以内，又是甚麽原因呢？誰都知道，在這一時期中，政治上是没有甚麽重大變化的，而同時經濟上，如農業則因爲去年六，七月間全國十餘省區遭受空前的旱水災之侵襲，農產損失總値在千餘萬萬以上，收穫量僅當十足年百分之五十至六十，除工業原料品外，如糧食自給尙且不足，何來餘額大量輸出，所以去年一年中，上海與内地之間的現銀移動，除去最後二月俱有特别意義外，上海恒在入超地位（參看下列上海現銀移動表），至於一般工商業，也因外貨的加緊傾銷與農村購買大之　减，而比前更加衰落。據報紙不完全的記載，僅去年十二月至今年一月十五日一個月半間，上海倒閉的銀行錢莊工廠商店，已有六十餘家之多。從此看來，可見近數月來上海拆息之高漲與下跌，旣不是政治的影響，也不是農工商業的發揚。那末到底是甚麽原因呢？要解答這個問題，我們决不能如一般人所說，這是年關結賬期必有的現象，與白銀問題毫無關係。爲什麽呢？因爲年關結賬期，僅能說明二十八及三十兩日突漲至六角的原因，而决不能說明前此三四個月來已趨於高漲的原因。况結賬期，除了一部分新式銀行公司外，一般都是在本年一月底。近數日來正是日日　　一般人所遵守的結期，而拆息不但見高漲，反而跌入一角以内，從此可見實際的原因决不在此。事實恰恰與一般人所說的相反，就是近數月來上海拆息向上的波動，正是因爲白銀問題。謂予不信，請看下面一年來上海的現象銀移動表。</p>

<p>從上表看來，可見去年十一個月中，由國内各地移上上海的現銀，和由上海移出國内各地的現銀，除去最後二月俱有特别意義外，每月都是入超，倘若没有白銀問題將牠大量的移到外國去，則上海的拆息必因資金充拆而大爲下跌無疑。不錯，政府爲防止白銀大量的外流，也曾於去年九月間通令全國徵收白銀出口稅及平衡稅；但是第一，這一命令已是未免太遲了，因爲在未徵稅以前，從一月至九月中旬流到外國去的白銀已大有可觀，換句話說，就是此時國内以及上海的存銀已大爲激减；第二，實行徵稅以後，却又將平衡稅估得太低，納稅運出的白銀，實際仍是有利可圖，所以結果白銀的外流還是未見停止；第三，則因爲中國海岸線太長，以及受着種種不平等條約束縛，偷運私運出口無法禁止；第四，因爲奸商的偷運方法巧妙，首先由上海將白銀運入内地，然後再偷偷摸摸的轉口運往外國，如上表中十月與十一月上海的白銀大量流入内地便是。在這種情形下，那拆息之向上波動，是毫不足怪的了</p>
<p>除此以外尙有一個次要的原因，就是政府應付白銀問題過程中所起的謠言，如說政府將集中現金，减低幣値實行通貨膨脹等便是。因爲這些謠言足使一般持銀者駭怕，而將現銀蓄藏起來，减少了市面現銀的流通額，而助長了拆息之上漲。</p>
<p>上面我們已將近數月來上海拆息之向上波動的原因歸結到白銀問題中，那末現在白銀問題尙未解决，而拆息又突然趨跌，回到一角以内，這又是甚麽原因呢？關於這點，我們是可以這樣解釋的：就是當拆息極度高漲時，上海的金融界以及政府當局曾經用盡了一切方法，以人爲的方法來抑平。如中央中國交通三銀行以一千萬元低息拆借於各銀行錢莊，以資應付緊急，銀行準備委員會發給準備財產公單十足流通，以資調劑市面，政府頻频闢謠，以安定人心，外匯平市會由香港購入二千萬元，以資穩定金融等便是。正因爲最近的拆息之趨跌是人爲的，所以今後拆息的前途，倘若白銀問題没有解决，則必然的要跟着農村破產農民赤貧化，没有大量現銀的移入，和上海金融界以及政府之無力，而再度向上波動無疑。</p>
<h3>一年來外滙波動之輪廓</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>（一）緒言</p>
<p>或謂滙兌戰爭，法啓厥釁，英當其衝，日美亦遂捲入漩渦。（ＡＡrnaune:LeMonnaie</p>
<p>LeGredit　etLeChange）嗣戰區擴張，頻年演進，至於今日，殆亡處而無其例，上海蔚爲東方一大金融樞紐，貿易頻繁，商旅輻輳，其滙兌市塲，自亦陷爲匯兌戰塲之一隅。雖然，苟吾儕佇立淺灘之緣，則徒見渺漫瀄汨，　　潺湲，其起伏之勢，莫能究詰。若夫陟彼高岡，引項遠瞻，則水天間成一Ｈorizon，潮之消長，不無踪跡可尋。外匯之波動亦猶是也，一日間倐鬆倐緊，盤旋不居。積日成月，月其難究矣；積月成歲，歲其難究矣。爰綜觀一年來上海外匯之消長，擷其華，探其源，以覘其經濟學上所謂長期趨勢，而窺國際滙市變動之一角。</p>
<p>（二）一般的趨勢</p>
<p>居今之世，而不採「滙兌傾銷」政策者鮮矣。戰後法國恢復金本位，新平價僅逮舊平價之伍一。英一九三一年秋放棄金本位後，亦遽行膨脹通貨；東鄰日本倣之。美自銀行風潮襲來，恐慌尖銳化，去年正月末迺有减低平價爲五角九分零六毫之舉。他若捷克，奥大利，·······諸國，亦相率趨於是，以其蕞爾小國，未爲吾人意及耳。滙兌傾銷之鵠的，或爲輕减債務負擔，或爲促進對外貿易：美日屬諸後者之範圍，歐洲諸國則兼之。吾國爲容納過剩商品之歸墟，而爲列强所逐鹿，滙兌變動，爲最佳之反映。</p>

<p>（註）此係中國銀行經濟研究室根據九種電滙行市而編成者。</p>
<p>吾人按圖索驥，即見一年來迭現新高峯，除五月市面極端紛亂而呈畸形之狀態外，均有逐步上漲之趨勢。九月份之平均數六六·八二，尤爲五年來所未見者。此僅係就其綜合的趨勢而言，更分析其構成分子之變動：則美滙放長之勢最劇，次爲日匯，再次爲先令羅比，法郎，福祿林，馬克等則變化較尠。後數者於吾國關係較疏，總指數之編製係一視同仁，未加權重，故結果尙未足視爲吾國外滙市况之指標。請復進而分析研討之。</p>
<p>（三）各别的變動</p>
<p>綜觀去年外滙市况，可分之爲五期：（一）昇騰期，（二）降落期，（三）停滯期，（四）紛亂期，（五）平靜期是也，此純係便於述說而杜撰者，是否有　，則有待商明之指正也。</p>
<p>昇騰期（一月至三月）一月，日本議會爭論財政膨脹案，美减低平價運動醞釀已久，時機垂熟，外匯因之掀動。日美兩滙放長神速：計日滙最高達一一三·五元（日金，下倣此），較去年同期平均之九五·○一元，長十八元以上。美匯挺長約十五元（美金，下倣此），最高價達三四·五元，去年同期平均則僅一九·八二一四也。迨入二月，適値夏曆年關，向例需要懈淡。至第三週投機帮小量塞進外幣，繼而美提高銀價之說復熾，金子帮抛出外滙，空方陣容，頗爲壯觀，達一千五百萬元。第四週美銀消息寂然，空方消極，次第扒進，陣容紊亂。是月也，本埠外滙一致放長，漲勢最烈者，厥推美匯，計平均價爲三三·九六六元，較上月躍進四角六分六厘。先令平平，日滙昇至一一三·三二元，較去年同期長二·○七元。三月市况，一仍舊觀。茲有値得吾人提及者，即二月底印度宣布减低銀進口稅；吾國商人有裝運白銀往孟買者，印匯陡漲，最高峯迺達九四·二五羅比，平均則爲八九·三五羅比。日匯亦告俏長，本月份最高價一一五元，平均一一三·七五元，爲數年來之新紀錄。此外各匯均較上月緊縮。計美匯最高價三四·七五元，較上月略緊，然平均價則放鬆七分五厘，而達三四·二五元新高價：蓋白銀政策之影響仍未戢也。英匯最高價爲一先令四便士三七五，平均一先令四便士一二五，均較上月爲緊。</p>
<p>降落期（四月至六月）迨乎四月，市况趨於下游。海外銀市動搖，標金步漲，投機之外滙套頭交易雖盛，而商業方面之需求則仍奄無生氣。跌風以日滙美匯爲最：日滙最高一一三·二五元，平均一一○·五九元，較上月跌三元十六錢。夷考厥由，蓋日本實行「金買上法案」，日金價格高翔，有以致之。美滙最高三四·七五元，平均三二·五○元，較上月跌縮·二八六元，此則係因白銀運動又告銷沉故也。英匯較爲穩健，盤旋於一先令四便士左右，五月市况承上月之餘風，萎靡不振，且更呈杌隉不安之象。蓋國際間金銀問題謠諑頻興，（法有放棄金本位之說，德又謠傳馬克貶價），市塲空氣動搖不定，滙價大勢趨於沉淪。第三週傳美白銀政策將有新進展，本埠各滙隨之上漲。英滙步漲至一先令三便士六二五，美滙臻三三·六二五元。第四週美徵收白銀利益稅五○○，滙價遂告疲弱。六月之第一二週，其呆滯狀態未减有加。至第三週人心轉堅，市價逐步向上。第四週因美國通過白銀法案，銀價飛黃騰達，外滙一致放長，是爲一大轉機。計英滙最高一先令四便士，最低一先令三便士三七五，平均一先令三便士五七五，較上月放長·三四六便士。美滙最高三三·七五元，最低三二·七五元，平均三二·七六元，較五月份放長·五六六元。日滙最高一一二·二五元，平均一○九·○四元，放長二·九五二元。</p>
<p>停滯期（七月）丨丨第一週受銀行結賬例假影響，且國際間消息謐靜，投機者踟蹰不前，市况平穩。除六日至九日各滙稍見鬆長外，餘均無大變化。第二第三週，滙豐掛牌，終鮮變化。至第四週大連帮大量抛出，滙價略緊，然銀價疲乏，投機商興緻大不如前，故瞬即恢復原狀。</p>
<p>紛亂期（八月）丨丨第一週市塲傳說紛紜，人心浮動，滙兌受其掀動。先令與美滙大漲：英滙自一先令四便士又十六分之一昇至一先令四更士又十六分之五：美滙自三三·七五元昇至三四·二五元。第二週美國白銀國有法案正式宣佈，通貨膨脹之說尤盛，海外銀價高翔。英滙又現新高峯，即期電滙一先令四便士六八七五，美滙最高價爲三五·三七五元，銀行賣户猛抛不已。第三週市况瞬間千變萬化，投機之風頗不寂寞，此仆彼起。第四週投機者爭購美元，白銀流出之勢爲歷來所罕見，某大銀行又復大量抛售英滙，光怪陸離，莫可言狀。</p>
<p>平靜期（九月至十二月）丨丨此數月中，雖有小小波瀾，然大體則甚平穩。九月之第一週，美國暫停購買白銀，海外銀市平平，本埠標金微漲，滙價亦隨之微動。第二週財部取締標金外滙投機之訓令，至外滙市塲，立告停滯。第三第四兩週。銀行界切實與財部合作，拒絶投機買賣，故交易頗爲寂寞。市價雖見上漲，美滙最高三六元，英滙一先令五便士三七五，爲廢兩改元以來之最高價。惟投機者已告絶跡，實際商業上之需要又微，故市價等於虚設。十月首週，一仍舊觀。二週滙價又節節放長，計英滙達一先令六便士，美滙至三七·五元，日滙將達一三○元。三週財部徵白銀稅開始，迺復常態。雖市塲人心極度不安，外商銀行又力謀操縱，端賴中央銀行與華商諸銀行恊力援助，故能履險若夷。四週如之。十一月恢復昔日之靜態，清風徐來，風波不興。次週末倫敦銀價漲起一便士二五之鉅，滙市本應作大波動，惟有平衡稅之抵銷，故能轉危爲安。三四兩週更入平靜之境，市塲狹窄，人心安定，斯亦爲近日金融界差强人意之事也。十二月市塲局勢更趨緩和，外滙變動幾希。蓋斯時洋拆之漲風已戢，本埠庫存减少額見鬆。第二週又有通貨膨脹之謠傳，投機者爭購外幣。第三週財部與汪精衛氏聲明通貨政策變動之無稽，人心大定，惟英美滙仍略有堅俏。第四週因耶誕節關係，市况平穩，無足記述。</p>

<p>（四）結語</p>
<p>外滙之變動，就其常態而言，應視貿易（廣義的）之逆順而轉移。然細察吾國外滙之變動，則投機買賣實爲主因。其變動也飄忽閃爍或爲一二大户所操縱，或爲無稽謠言所掀動。滙率變動越劇，則貨幣之穩定性大受障碍，馴致影響物價，擾辭金融。當局有鑒於斯，已着手救濟，頗能收效。所惜見諸實施者僅爲局部之辦法，管理滙兌之全盤計劃，迄未倡行。近日專家學者，頗多貢獻意見，當局者似有接受之可能。詩曰：「周雖舊邦，其命維新」。况乎國民革命之政府乎？</p>

<p>— 余雲岫講　江晦鳴記�Z]　　講到中國呢，也有和日本相彷彿的事情，就是清朝的經學。諸君大約都曉得，宋朝是講性理的，所遵重的是大學，中庸，孟子，憑着個人空想，再參加着這家釋家的議論，產出一種宋學講性講理，都是避實逃空的話，但是所講的都可拿來做帝王制度的保障；所以自宋以後，經過金元明清，政治分子都利用他尊重他。但是明末清初的時候，已經有顧亭林，胡胐明，毛西河等提倡考據排什節論。到了清朝中葉，有惠揀戴東原兩人把考據的學擴張了，解說經書專根據漢儒的學說，所以成了種學派，呌做漢學，就中戴東原的影響最大，戴氏因爲特具一種堅實的精神，博學强記的本領，把講性理的空疏宋學，一脚蹴倒。至於解說經書，一字一句都要有來歷，不許憑空臆造的。戴氏著了一部「孟子字義疏證」，把宋儒所說的理性天道，駁得體無完膚；要曉得宋儒的性理，是帝王們居上馭下的利器，自由思想的桎梏，所以把他推翻了，人民的自由思想，就有解放的動機，帝王愚民政策，也失了一道重要的防綫。我聽到人家說：清朝的失敗，其根源實在是導源於漢學，這句話實在是見得到學術人心轉移的關係。　　不過，這種實事想是的學術，在中國是發生在經學上，所以影響到的是政治革命；日本發生在醫學上，所以影響到的直接也在醫學。可惜我們中國舊醫界裏，没有戴東原，不然，舊醫也就早會革新了。　　後來講漢學的，像孫星衍先生，他也是講漢學的大家，他曾經校刋幾種醫書，注重考古，可是他不是專門的醫家，所以對於中國的醫學並没有多大影響。講漢學而與醫學有影響的，祗有兪樾丨丨兪曲園先生，他有五篇廢醫論，他說舊說脈與藥，均没有根據，發聾振聵，足以警醒二千年的迷夢。但在地域廣大，人心浮動的中國，種種精髓和警闢的議論，誰也不來過問，誰也不來理會，結果，有影響的話，也就變成没影響！這就是中國的醫家，没有實事求是的誠意，也就是近世紀中日醫學變遷上一個不同的方。　　現在舉出一般事實，來證明中日兩國政治分子對於醫學的頭腦，相差不知有多少。日本從西洋醫學輸入以後，所謂一般漢醫，在過渡時期中，當然，没有完全淘汰。當時日本的漢醫，像淺田宗伯，是很有名的，明治時的皇太子丨丨就是大正，生了肺病，說是由他醫好的。這話不見得確實，也不見得没有根據；因爲，肺結核是一種慢性病，它的經過很長，變化也很有出入，單單靠着營養療法，也未嘗不可將肺病治好，我們不管明治的皇太子的病，是不是眞正是淺田治好的，總之，喫了淺田的藥以後，病症慢慢好起來了，這是事實。假使，這件事出現在中國，那可不得了，漢醫一定要大擂大吹，新醫一定更要被他們駡得一文不値了。可是在日本呢？新醫依然借着政治的力量在猛進，絲毫不因爲這個印象，而迷信漢醫，而不信任科學。諸位！他們的政治領袖的頭腦是怎樣的清明？　　　我宣傳醫學革命的年數，已經是很久了。我所批評舊醫的文字，是一字一句都有根據，有頭腦的人，早就該覺悟，不致再來徘徊歧路了。結果呢？一般社會的人對於疾病醫藥，依然隨便說，隨便做，我就和他們說得舌敝唇焦，也不過是言者諄諄，聽者藐藐。像要人們請舊醫診病，原也不算希罕的一回事，但是就中有極大的關係，我覺得我們中國人，一身都是勢利，滿腔只有虚榮，不是崇拜英雄服從眞理的民族！祗要有勢力有名望的人提倡了一回事，民衆們就不問可否，不論是非的會盲從附和起來。胡適之生了一次腎病，被舊醫凑拍好了，就竭力替他介紹，因此結識了幾個政治上大老大先生，就替他捧塲，什麽療養院的來由，恐怕就是這樣吧？而一班政治的小老呢，看見大老捧國醫的塲，也就混在一塊兒胡鬧，因此鬧得國醫館呀，國醫條例呀，進一步還要把國醫館變做政治衙門呀，鬧得天花亂墜！這種怪奇的活劇，畸形的發達，直接影響到中國的醫學，確實很大。所以我們的醫學革命還没有成功，國醫們還在那裏活躍，我敢說，都是由這班大老先生們在上而提倡成功的！唉！諸君想一想：淺田宗伯醫好了明治皇太子，不能在帝國大學裏面另闢一位講座，不能救日本漢醫的廢棄；國醫們醫好了一個名士，結識了幾個大老，就會鬧得天翻地覆，演成怪劇，好像頭腦裏根本有了問題，說起來眞敎人又要笑又要哭（未完）蘇省保安團隊衛生狀况調查  顧岡　　自去年南昌行營「保安會議」頒發「各省保安部制改進大綱」後，蘇省保安團隊，紛紛改組，迄二十三年終了，已成立者計保安團四團；特務營一營；保安隊四十六大隊；曁水上保安隊等，已足敷蘇省目前之調遣，政府更爲求事權統一，命蘇主席陳果夫氏，兼全省保安司令，陳氏對諸衛生事業，素極重視，故自兼司令以來，保安團隊之衛生機關，積極整頓，已粗具軌範，茲將調查所得，分述於次：　　甲、衛生行政　　「保安處」本設第四科，專職各團隊衛生行政上之事宜及人事問題等，二十三年十月，奉令裁撤，改由「軍醫院」兼辦。　　乙、衛生敎育　　一·軍醫訓練班　　經過······該班於二十三年八月籌備，十月招生上課，學員五十名，六個月畢業，入學資格：爲曾任中少尉軍醫或公私立醫院實習四年以上者，各項費用，均由省府供給，畢業後由省府分發各大隊，以中少尉軍醫任用。　　編制······設上校主任一人；少校敎務長一人；敎官上中校各一人；少校三人；上尉四人；隊長上中尉各一人；各項生活，均遵軍事訓練。　　課程······普通課程；有藥物學；診斷學；内科學；外科學；花柳科學；皮膚科學；眼科學；耳鼻咽喉科學；及黨義等九種。專門課程；有軍陣衛生學；陸軍平時衛生勤務學；陸軍戰時衛生勤務學；毒氣預防敎程；軍醫法規；及軍事學等六種。每週學科三十八小時，術科十二小時。　　二·護士訓練班　　該班係「軍醫院」兼辦，課程注重於護理學及調劑學，第一期業已畢業，大部留「軍醫院」任用。　　丙、衛生機關　　一·軍醫院　　槪况······該院設於鎭江，於二十二年由「保安處醫務所」改組所成，院舍四十餘間，普通病床五十張；隔離病床二十張；本年度全省「保安隊」成立後，已不敷應用，現正籌備擴充，並爲便於江北勦匪部隊之便利，擬於江北中心地帶，添設分院。　　編制······上校院長（程學銘）一人；少校主任（畢煥奎，張啟華）二人；上尉軍醫二人；上中尉司藥各一人；中尉護士長一人；看護士兵三十名；曁軍需，副官，書記，司書，特務長等。　　經費·······按月由省府撥給醫藥費四百五十元；辦公費二百元；官兵薪餉，均遵軍部規定，按級支付。　　二·各團醫務所　　各團醫務所均隨團本部行正，設少校主任一；上尉軍醫二；中尉軍醫一；看護士兵十；月領醫藥費一百五十元；辦公費五十元；薪餉按級支發。　　三·各大隊醫務所　　全省四十六大隊醫務所，均未成立，須待「軍醫訓練班」第一期畢業後，由省府委發而分别創設，按編制所訂，每大隊設中或少尉軍醫一；看護士兵一；看護兵二；薪餉按級領取，辦公費無，醫藥費以每一土兵每月一角計，全月實領五十元。　　總之：蘇省衛生事業，日趨上乘，如全省中醫之檢定；醫政學院之創辦；助產學校及省立醫院之擴充；公娼制之省會試辦；各縣衛生科之增設等。今又全省保安團隊衛生機關之整頓，是足與各省所爭榮者也。茲僅將保安團隊衛生狀况調查所得，供各省軍政當局及關心軍醫事業者作一參考耳。中國醫業之病態（上）  沈松年　　在現代一切都落後的中國，「醫業」亦何獨不然？說起了它，我們實覺很慚愧！中國自從神農嘗百草，黃帝著内經開醫藥基業以來，其後雖曾經不少先進者努力，給予我國醫藥進步不少的影響；可是這進步，實太可憐！他們（古代醫藥先進）的供獻，僅是極幼稚的，不過是零碎片斷一知半解的經騐而已，卽使著作成書問世，都是門户之見甚深，並却定要硬生生配上五行相尅之玄說。把智識幼稚眼光短淺的人們迷入五里霧中。後人受了它的洗禮，被感染了，也與他一樣的主觀見解：以爲袛憑藉它的學識足可應用了。我們不是聖賢不應妄求其他，聖賢的話，總是不錯的，無改進之必要。人人心中腦中存了此念，於是中國醫業直到近代，還是充滿着十九世紀以前的玄氣，與先進各國的科學醫相去太遠。</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>近幾十年來，國人接受了外洋高壓文化，受了種種刺激，深知祗是如此玄下去，没落就在眼前了，遂卽產生了科學醫來替代，這是可値得欣幸的！　　可是事實，却不盡然！其中均有其病態在。茲特歸納言之於後，以供同好研究。　　甲　科學醫的不普遍　　在這過渡時代中，科學的怒潮，雖已高聳入雲，已得了稍有智識階級的人們也堅信了。可是其餘百分之八十以上之文盲，却始終還得不到科學的實惠。其原因，甚爲複雜，姑略述如左：　　（一）多數科學醫太貴族化　　過慣都市適意生活的醫科畢業生，行起醫來一切都力求其　，以滿足其物質享受，於是不得不在病家身上計算，拚命抬高診金，以彌補之。可是在這不景氣的民間，那能負擔這高價的醫費？卽使醫者能免其醫費，恐大都平民還不能擔負其藥費。例如數十元代價的白喉血清，平民無力享受，不得已只得去仰仗玄醫。　　（二）多數科學醫太洋化　　在這過渡時代，還未有眞正的中國代表醫產生之前，在國内有英美德日法等派别，而他們也自命爲德醫，日醫，······之類，好像與中國不生什麽關係，新從他國搬來似的，一切莫不力求洋化，毫不體察民情，診金藥資可由他們任意抬高。於是大都數平民都望　却步，失了他們的信仰力。　　（三）受冐牌科學醫之累　　江湖式的醫者，學識當然是欠缺的，人格卑鄙，祇憑藉偷來的一點經騐技能，如曾在醫院中提過皮包的工役等是，他們居然也至民間去行起醫來，說自己是科學醫。試想這等不學無術之人操起醫業來，難免没有危險發生？一發生使民間受了一惡劣印象，以爲科學醫類皆如此而已。遂卽整個科學醫聯帶被累！　　（四）受玄醫的影響　　玄醫是我國固有的醫學操業者，他雖不合科學原理，在現代已落了伍；因其能體察民情，適合民間經濟能力，是以他現雖已陷苟延殘喘的掙扎期中，還能受着多數平民的信仰着。他們是科學醫發展的障碍物，能阻碍科學醫的發展。　　（五）科學醫的畸形　　都市因物質利慾的誘惑，故人們莫不麕集都市，於是都市得以畸形的發展，結果科學醫弄得過剩；而返觀鄕村，竟貧乏得可憐，不敷支配其萬一　　（六）國人智識的低落　　我國文盲滿地皆是，就是稍有智識者，却還不知科學醫的眞諦，故信仰力甚爲薄弱。　　（七）受迷信的影響　　迷信是科學的大敵，破除迷信，科學才能發展。我國民間的迷信，爲世界上所特有。無知愚民只知問卜求籤。以解除疾病，如其偶有疾病轉機，認爲菩薩靈騐，遇有不救，便以爲是不誠心所致，或壽限已到。菩薩終是不錯的。至科學醫他們腦中根本不知道的。　　明白了上述數點，已略可知科學醫所以不能普遍的癥結。茲再看玄醫的隊伍裏是怎樣的？　　乙　給時代開倒車的玄醫充塞民間　　時代潮流是不息地在前進，產生了新的進步的時，落伍者，卽歸淘汰。「宮室興而巢居廢烹飪作而生食絶」這是誰都知道的。足徵其不爲人工所淘汰：將來必爲天然所淘汰無疑！凡稍知潮流趨勢者，决不會加以否認的。茲可以其歸納爲二類：　　（一）玩舊而不知進取者　　此類人眼光短淺，一味死讀書，讀了那一書，以爲足可應用了，不去作進一步的研求。以偶有所發現之一知半解之片斷經騐認爲非凡，秘而不宣。並只知拚命保守固有不適於現代的遺骸，美其名曰：保存國粹。把人類進化的輪子，倒退一世紀，試想這是可能的嗎？丨丨在他們之中，又可分爲如下數類：　　儒醫：丨這類人是從前求功名失望，無以餬口，只得流入醫業，以維生活。　　世醫：丨祖宗也曾行醫，繼其志者，自命爲祖傳，謂之世醫。　　受業醫：丨此類人學識經騐均得自其師，數年畢業後，可自由懸壺。　　這些人學問極其幼稚，有些還不滿高小畢業，就可學醫了，只有儒醫比較多讀一點書，然其思想却很頑固，因受八股文的遺毒。試想高深的醫業操在這些人手中，難怪中國醫業至今仍未得進步。彼先進各國，在昔醫業也操在無知的僧人手中，其後一轉移到受高深學問的人手中，故有今如此之進展。丨在其中，又分爲時派與經派。時派醫病採取緩緩圖治之法；經派則反之。　　至他們所讀的書，没有系統，皆不一致，各有其所宗；當然意見紛歧，正似一盤散沙，毫無團結心，互助力，只知破壞同道名譽爲能事。也不爲國利前途設想。只知拚命拒絶外來進步的學說，以爲有碍國粹，腦中只知計算着診金；其他可說不知别的。　　（二）頭腦比較新穎的改進派　　此類人實太可憐，明知科學的偉大，却無從得以入門，環境不容許他們有進修的機會，只得彷徨歧途，無所適從。有機會時拚命研討一切書籍。丨其實此類人若予他進修的機會，倒可成器，可作中國的代表醫。否則那倒弊端百出，危險萬分。疾病常識問答  程瀚章　　（五十三）敗血症（SepsisiSepticamia）（上）　　(問)什麽呌做敗血症？　　（答）敗血症，是對於種種重劇的細菌性全身傳染的總括名稱。大多數在身體的一定部分先起原發病竈，而病毒就從這部分陸續或斷續的流入血中，於是起全身的敗血症，但也有原發病竈不明的。　　(問)有時候，有稱爲敗血膿毒症的，是怎麽樣的病症？　　（答）這就是敗血症時同時在各種器官起多數轉移性化膿的病症，所以也呌膿毒症。　　(問)敗血症的病原細菌，是那幾種？　　（答）敗血症的病原，最占多數的是鏈球菌和葡萄狀球菌；其次是肺炎菌，大腸菌；間或有腦膜炎菌，綠膿菌，傷寒症菌或腐敗菌等。　　(問)這些病菌的侵入門户，是那幾處？　　（答）侵入門户很多：像皮膏，（在創傷，癰疽，褥瘡蜂窠織炎時）女性器，（在分娩，流產時）口腔，（在齲齒，咽峽炎時）中耳炎，消化器，（在食道癌，胃癌，直腸癌，痢疾，肝膿瘍，膽道炎，蚓突炎時）呼吸器，（在鼻炎，支氣管炎，肺炎，肺膿瘍，肺壞疽，膿胸時）泌尿器，（淋疾，膀胱黏膜炎，腎盂炎，腎膿瘍等時）陳舊的化膿竈（在骨和關節等處）等都可以侵入的。也有侵入門户不明的。　　(問)發生敗血症時的初起病狀怎樣？　　（答）大都没有前驅症狀而突然以惡寒戰慄發熱開始的。　　(問)敗血症發熱后情形怎樣？　　（答）發熱，大多數情形是弛張不定，或間歇性的。但也有稽留不退的。在發熱前有惡寒戰慄，體溫昇到四十或四十一度以上。不多時候，就十分下降，更反復發同樣的熱度和惡寒。這就稱爲膿毒性熱。　　(問)發生敗血症時，皮膚上有什麽現象？　　(答)皮膚起出血性症狀，見點狀或廣泛性皮下和黏膜出血，（齒齦出血，衂血，血尿血便等）有時現猩紅熱狀，麻疹狀，多發性滲出性紅斑，或結節狀紅斑。也有見膿疱疹或匐行疹的。　　(問)發生敗血症時，循環系統内，有什麽變化？　　（答）心臟起水泡性雜音，心濁音界擴大；這時候可以知道已經發生心包炎或心肌炎。脈搏頻數不整。血液中見赤血球减少和白血球增多。重症時，白血球也得减少。　　(問)神經系統中有什麽病狀？　　（答）敗血症時病人多頭病，嘔吐，譫語，昏睡，痙攣，很像腦脊髓膜炎時的症狀。若已發腦膿瘍腦出血，膿性腦膜炎，軟腦膜炎等時，忽然起半身不遂，半身痙攣，失語症，等。（未完）　　　×　×　×　×耳鼻喉眼衛生常識  唐仁縉　　（三十三）猩紅熱（續）　　猩紅熱的合併症‖患猩紅熱的時候。常常可以發生合併症。合併症發生得愈多。病人的痛苦和危險。當亦更甚。幸而各種合併症。並不是個個病人都要發生的。他的輕重。亦不一定。有的時候。是輕症的合併症。毫無生命上的關係。有的時候。是重症的合併症。常有致命的危險。這種情形，完全由於本病流行時候的性質，本病的毒素，病人的抵抗力，治療的遲早，和治療的得當與不等等而定。現在且將猩紅熱最普通最重要的合併症。　　說一說。　　（一）咽頭粘膜和扁桃腺的壞疽性炎症‖就是指猩紅熱性實扶的里而言。發生於猩紅熱的第三日。或第五日的左右。他的現象。卽在扁桃線，口蓋弓，懸壅垂等處。發生汚穢灰白色的斑點。此種斑點增大急速。粘膜組織漸次形成乾燥性壞死。此部如若剝脫。則貽物質缺損。同時頸部和顎下部的淋巴腺。均來著明的腫脹。　　（二）顎下淋巴腺炎及頸部淋巴腺炎‖這種淋巴腺炎和扁桃腺炎及實扶的里。均有密切的關係。就是猩紅熱性扁桃腺炎所發的中等度腫大的淋巴腺。若在猩紅熱性實扶的里的時候。那就更爲增大硬固。並有著明劇烈的壓痛。至於化膿性淋巴腺周圍炎，頸部蜂窩織炎，及咽頭後膿瘍等炎症蔓延的結果。則大都發於重症的猩紅熱性實扶的里。　　（三）猩紅熱性腎臟炎‖猩紅熱在有熱度的時候。雖有發現輕度的蛋白尿。但尙不致爲害。因爲在一般發熱病症的經過中。常有這種現象發生的（所謂熱性蛋白尿）。不過有時到了第三星期（落屑期的經過中）。漸次發生眞正的腎臟炎。是卽所謂猩紅熱性腎臟炎。此時尿量大减。排泄多量的蛋白質，血液，和圓柱狀腎上皮。體溫大都昇騰。病人的顏面和體部。常來浮腫。有時病勢進行劇烈。常現尿毒症的症候（如頭痛，嘔吐，痙攣，昏睡等）。那就危險極了。　　（四）化膿性中耳炎‖多發生於兩側（限於一側的較少）。此時的體溫。再事昇騰。病人感覺耳内疼痛，耳鳴，難聽等等耳症狀。鼓膜常穿孔。以致耳内流膿。因此往往引起乳嘴突起部的腫脹和疼痛。變爲乳嘴突起炎。在重症的時候。他的炎症。常可侵及腦膜，腦竇，腦實質等處。而陷病人於危險的地步。　　（五）猩紅熱性關節僂麻質斯‖在猩紅熱的落屑期中。關節往往發生輕度的腫脹疼痛，皮膚潮紅，和運動障碍。普通侵犯手腕關節，指關節，和膝關節。大都蔓延多數關節。幸而他的經過。均屬良性。大約一週左右。卽可退去炎症症狀。但是有時可以變爲化膿性關節炎。因此常有釀成敗血症的危險。這是因爲連鎖狀球菌侵入關節的緣故。（未完）介紹新著　　鍾志和醫師主編丨丨杭州廣濟醫社出版之「隔離醫院護病須知」，内容豐富，印刷神良，凡傳染病之原因，起伏，病狀·等，無不詳細說明，凡醫界及護士界，均宜人手一編，用特爲之介紹。止痛的醫學  李興　　（一）　　痛是人生的大仇敵。世界没有人不怕死，也没有人不怕痛。很多人怕痛甚於怕死。爲了這個痛有許多的人甘心低首作了麻醉品的奴隸，被麻醉毒品緊緊捆綁，敗身裂名，傾家蕩產，甚至賣友賣國亦所不惜。都是爲了這個痛，也都是爲了要止痛，所以痛是萬惡的，不正當的止痛方法也是萬惡的。明白痛在身内到底是何種生理作用，如何用正當的方法止痛，如何可不用麻醉毒品止痛，如何可不作麻醉毒品奴隸，這是屬於止痛的醫學。這不是糢糢糊糊的止痛方法。是完全科學醫學的方法。望國人對於這一種醫學特别注意研究庶不至墮於毒品地獄以内。此卽實行新生活作健全國民而不作毒品奴隸的意義。　　痛在人身内是一種主觀的感覺丨只有自己痛才曉得什麽是痛。只有受痛的人可以形容痛，别人不能完全知道。有的人特别遭遇疼痛比普通人多些。多半人遭遇疼痛是自己招的，或者是不曉得預防的方法。少數人的疼痛是由環境造成的。茲述止痛的醫學以供讀者研究。　　有人要問，爲什麽要有疼痛？痛到底是與人有害處還是有益處？答，天然賜給我們這個身體，各部分有各部的巧妙功用。若是一部分損壞了就喪失一部分功用。那末，若是没有痛，有的人就是割掉他一隻手或剜掉一隻眼他也不管。這樣不久身體就不成爲完全身體。比方，把手指放在熱火爐上，因爲忍不住痛就必須急速將手指撤離火爐。反之，若是人没有痛覺幾秒鐘之久就把手指燒壞了。所以我們若没有痛覺就不能長久保守身體。這樣痛可算是與人有益的，怎麽樣呢？就是人身體一部分受了傷就有了痛，有了痛就必須休養治療，也必須等到全愈了才能使用。由此可見痛與保守身體的健全有極大的關係。　　痛的解剖生理學痛在身内到底是什麽作用，痛到底是什麽東西，是很値得我們研究的。現在比方，手受傷手痛到底痛的知覺在受傷處還是身體别部分呢？答，受的傷是在手但痛的知覺却是在大腦當中。假設，大腦當中管理痛覺的一部分喪失了功用，就是手受了傷或任何部分受了傷就都没有疼痛的感覺。如此類推身體任何部分痛都是一樣作用。茲附圖說於下：　　第一圖說明（未完）第一圖肺結核淺說（四○）  胡嘉言　　第九章　臨床上的經過　　肺結核症的幾個主要症象，在前面第七章裏面已經大槪叙述過了。但是我們曉得，肺結核是一個最複雜的病症：根據病灶的性質，有病理解剖上的種種類别；因病灶容積的大小，又有初期次期三期的不同；單就開始的情形來講，已有突然和遲緩的不同；至於他的進行狀態，最後的結果，一層一層的經過詳情；都是各有各的特殊型式的。如果要想熟知本症全部的情形，單獨靠前面所述的幾個症象，是决對不够的；關於每一種本症的經過情形，一定要另行叙述方行的。這就是本章所述的臨床上的經過了！　　臨床上的經過是怎樣的情形呢？這决不是一個固定型式所可包括的。在病理解剖裏面，已經有滲出性和增生性兩種分别了；他們臨床上的經過情形，完全是各自爲政，各有其特殊之點的。這是就完成的型式而言的。至於在早期診斷一方面，也有幾個基本型式，各有其特殊之症象的；像肺門腺體結核，就是一個顯著的例子。肺尖結核一名詞，在過去幾年，也是無人不道此的。再進一步，如果我們推源溯始，那當然讓結蘭克氏的初期集合（第一期　　）了。這在臨床上的認識，雖然是萬分困難，但也有他的本身特點，不能完全捨棄不題的。所以本章序述的次序：最初係蘭克氏首期的情形，次則屬諸早期診斷方面的幾種型式；最後方提到完成的型式，滲出性和增生性的大槪。這對於讀者方面的領會，似乎較困難一點；其實根據本症完成的前後來講，也應該如此方是順序而適當的；這一點，我想讀者們一定能够了解的！（未完）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言熊毛佳話  吹　　我昨天打開報紙一看，便見極大的標題，「熊毛嘉禮誌盛」六字，并且附有小標題，說「新郎容光煥發，精神興奮，新娘薄施脂粉，儀態萬千，」這兩句形容詞，想必記者先生格外地寫得有聲有色，但拿所登載的結婚照片，參看一下，却是不差，眞要笑此老興復不淺，剃去長鬍鬚，來做新倌人，造成這一段風流艶史，而壁間所縣掛的許多聯語，最堪發噱的，便是鄭洪年聯云「兒孫環繞迎新母，樂趣婆娑看老夫，」馮陳昭宇聯，「舊同學成新伯母，老年伯作大姐夫，」眞是别開生面，有此妙人，有此妙事。　　在從前的時代，少有這樣的韵事發生，怪不得大家看了，驚爲詫異，因爲從前像熊鳳凰的地位，資望，金屋中儲藏着半打巴小老婆，算不了一回事，卽使死了一個大老婆，還有許多小老婆來奉陪，絶不會感覺到什麽寂寞痛苦，就是普通一點的人家，死了大老婆，便去討一位如夫人，神不知鬼不覺，這也很平凡而極普通的事，所以到了這樣的年齡，再没有重去討大老婆的，現在民國的法律，「不准討小，只准討大，」所以造成這風流佳話，倘然把這西洋鏡拆穿些說，本來有什麽可怪。　　或者說年齡已到六旬以外，本來用不着再去討老婆，其實不然，我把老年人的須要老婆，比少年人更爲厲害，少年人須要老婆，無非解决性慾問題，而老年人不僅如此如此，這般，這般，一則是精神上的安慰，二則起居上的侍奉，三則生理上的補助，所謂有娘子不曉得無娘子的苦，不但少年，而老年更甚，故孔子云，七十非人不暖，想也是經騐之談。　　至於性慾問題，據靈樞素問云，女子七七而任脈虚，天癸竭，地道不通，丈夫七八而肝氣衰，天癸竭，腎藏衰，形體皆極，八八則齒髮去，這是僅就一般普通人而言。至於得天獨厚，或氣禀特殊的人，原是不在此例。我見有七十餘歲的老翁，而須要性慾，還同少年一般者亦往往有之，則老年人祗要精神健旺，氣體充實。娶妻原不是異數，鳳凰精神，亦諒必不弱。　　陶篁村置屋孤山，頗感孤寂，納一如夫人，梁山舟侍講調之以詩，茲錄二首於後，以當結束。見說榕江泛携技，已成陰後未凉時，一根楖栗無人管，分付樵青好護持，不比朝雲侍老坡，也如天女伴維摩，對門有個林和靖，冷抱梅花奈爾何。雪  謙　　天下雪了，雪像粉末那麽小，密密地飄下，不一會，路上，屋頂上，樹上，都輕輕地幕上了微白的一層，像輕紗，也像女人的薄施脂粉，　　冬天的色調原來就是近於灰和白，灰的樹木，灰的朝烟，灰的寒冰，更有灰的欲雪時的天色，現在襯上了滿地的白雪，特别顯得黯淡連那快要頽廢的朱紅的宮牆也襯得没有光彩了，　　呈在目前的白色一切，像畫師筆底下的圖畫一樣，漸漸的加濃，我從正陽門坐着車子朝着東交民巷走去，那穿得贅腫的車夫，鼻裏不住吐着寒烟；大約是他自己感到了冷的原故吧，他把車子擱下，要替我把車前的棉簾子蓋上，我却爲着要看雪，不讓他蓋着，雪粉把我的下身全漂白了，我也没有注意，我一心看看西洋式的街道和道旁整齊的街樹；葉是落盡了，只積着一層層的雪粉在枝椏上，路上的積雪綴上了一道道的車轍，遠看去，好像是在什麽地方見過的一幅描寫聖誕節的油畫，　　無論如何雪是可愛的，下雪是容易給人一種快感的，一片片像飛絮一般的東西，想來是何等無味呵，不料在空中飄起來，在道上積起來却這般有趣！奇怪的就是似乎下雪時的沉鬱的天色也會給人快感的，下雪時不也是一樣的天色麽，却不會使人感到「天欲雪」時所感到的興緻，不過這裏的理由也得簡單：雨會弄得泥濘滿道而雪却會把一切都妝扮的漂亮，她把難看的顏色都掩上了，剩着的只是圖案似輪廓：樹的綫條，屋頂的三角，蜿蜒無際的城垣的齒形曲綫，這些這些正像夜景一般易引起人的快感；夜景不是很有詩意的麽？　　想起我居住着的那條胡同，眞是全城最壞的一條了！然而下起雪來，却像一條古典的街道，假使你没有看過古代的羅馬的話，我就要騙你說這是古羅馬的市街了，至於名勝的地方，經過薄雪的點綴，更是詩意充溢了，從古人的吟咏裏，常常看出類的美麗的圖畫：詩人騎在驢子背上在雪地中慢慢地直着的情調，再說西湖吧，也不難想像小孤山上的梅花和雪花爭妍的勝景，無論如何，雪是可愛喲！　　記得雪萊詩中有「已是嚴冬春不遠」句其實嚴冬的情調也够有意思了，何必殷殷期待着春的降臨呢？春天最美麗的就是綠的色調，樹上，草原上，山腰上都舖上綠翠，然而又怎能比得上一片白雪的動人呢！綠色會給人以倦後的休憇，在背後却躱着疲怠的影子；白色却會給人活潑而不會有疲怠，就天氣說：春天是何等悶人的呵！冬季的寒冷却要使人興奮，快樂，有生氣，嚴冬的情調也够有意思，又何必殷殷期待着春的來臨呢！寒宵獨白  雅非　　當我夢醒的時候，便對自己發出了這樣的警告：　　感傷些什麽，儘管感傷有什麽用呢？過去的已經過去了，算了吧！未來的還待我們去體騐，幸福是從痛苦中掙扎出來的；有了痛苦才有幸福，假使幸福之前没有痛苦的話，這幸福也太無意義了······　　人類的幸福是需要人們去創造的，來吧！我們不要灰心，失望的後面就是成功，一次的失敗，給了我一次的經騐，灰心才是我們走上丨自殺之途，永遠没有回頭的日子······　　前面有着偉大的事業，正等待着我們去幹，我們不應該因小挫折而餒了志氣，爲小失敗而毁滅了前程：新時代到了，這不是我們做粉紅色美夢的時候了········　　奮鬥呵！光明在我們面前，黑暗在我們背後，我們要赶去了黑暗，逃到光明里面去。　　怕什麽呢？環境愈是惡劣，愈需要我們奮鬥，正因爲環境的惡劣，才用得着我們的奮鬥，加强了我們的意志，决心，不要氣餒，向前努力，前面有我們的出路······　　新的國家，新的社會，正需要我們去建設，我們應該將整個身心去獻給國家，獻給社會·····　　當我夢醒的時候，我明白我需要做一個勇敢的堅毅的人，我不應該給金錢支配，爲環境屈服，我需要奮門，需要掙扎；不灰心過去的失望，要追求着未來的憧憬！　　本來一個人的獻身社會，不一定要有怎樣的地位，怎樣的名譽，隨時隨地都有需要我們去做的事業，只要我們所走的路是正當的，那末縱使受到了任何挫折，也是極光榮的。　　青年們獻身社會，應該要抱犧牲的精神，但要自已心地光明，所幹的勾當對得住别人，對得住自己，雖受欺騙亦不足辱，祗須自己不去欺騙别人就好了；因爲受一次欺騙卽得到一次敎訓，一次經騐。　　我現在需要醒覺，不再做夢了；因爲我半生以來的醉生夢死生活，使我在此刻回想起來，實在覺得太無意義。我如今明白過來，凡事都得靠自己，去懇求别人是靠不住的，是可恥的；現在正有二條路漫長的展開在我們面前，一條是掙扎與奮鬥，一條是消極和頽廢，這二條中，我們可擇前一條走去。　　不必犧牲過去，祗要努力於將來，在這無盡的將來中去建設我們的事業，去創造我們的前程，去找取我們的生命，去······　　大家覺悟起來吧！凖備起來吧！負起我們唯一的武器，去和我們的敵人丨環境丨戰爭！</p>

<p>爐邊  阿純　　挾着書本子從寒風裏奔波了回來，突然地走進了暖和的屋子，欣慰自己在凛烈中掙扎的勇氣，並且覓得自己還是個很努力的人。　　然而，當靠近了爐子，暖氣遞傳了全身，在北風裏掛上了的寒冷都給打走了的時候，在這太舒服的境遇中，對着那燃燒着的煤火，對着那沸騰着的水，竟又呆住了，隨着又來了一陣子腦膜的波動！　　並没有給舒適的物質生活迷住了的，也没有給生活的鞭子苦痛地加上來，没有掙扎，没有拚命，只是在平淡中渡過了二十來個年頭，爲了平淡，爲了缺少些波折，整個的生活，就像一杯無味的淡茶，但是，回着頭望望過去了的路程，實在，也够麻煩你的了！　　不說遠的，就在二年前吧！正是一個蓬勃的春天，自己是混在常給有間階級消磨春天的杭州，更是在那錢唐江和六和塔交織中的秦望山頭，那裏是一羣純正的學子們讀書的地方，却也是哥兒姐兒享樂的所在，住的是高大的洋房，吃的是美味的菜飯，早上，有鳥語喚着你起身，推開窗子，就是那浩大的江水，滿山是正在奔放着的美麗的花朶，當晚風吹來的時候，鷓鴣聲中哥兒姐兒們會鬧下些春天的故事，誰都會羨慕的，這麽安適愉快的生活！然而，我這好動的傢伙，反而覓得這太安適的生活，在没有事的時候，往往會引起一種不安的！於是，在幾次思索交戰下，當夏天的開頭，就决然地離開了杭州，眞的，我要脫離學校，我不再做大學生，頂無恥的是那些只知在物質生活中享樂而不會生產的大學生！　　回到東方巴黎的都市，覺得生活的變化，的確比那簡單的自然環境要多了不少，投進了工作的塲所，然而，也可以繼續着讀書，眞是自己過去理想中的滿意的境遇，白天是學生們的敎師，晚上却是敎師們的學生。　　燦爛的是都市，複雜的是都市，多變化的也是都市，可是，這些燦爛，這些複雜，這些變化，實在也是够麻煩去應付的了！是的，不會騙人，不會吹牛，不會拍馬，一輩子也混不出頭的！像自己，終天的奔波，得到的只是些加在臉上的皺紋，想到了爸媽期待着的微笑，就得會慚愧地引起那一陣子的内心的忐忑！眞的，自己是太孩子了！爲什麽不學學騙人呢？　　常常有着期待着的明天，然而，也不必怪人，過去也曾給自己的不努力摧殘了的，要是再認眞地望着明天的活，我就不能再生活下去了！　　風聲打斷了沉思，爐上的水壺乾了！爐内已只剩了些殘餘的火燄，自己的生命總也不久會像那殘餘的氣息，杜格涅夫說：「人生會像一縷烟那麽的消滅�。」眞的，就是一個生命史像了曹雪芹描寫中的「紅樓夢」一樣的厚，結果，總也免不了消失的，我爲什麽要這麽認眞地呢？追求  穆犬龍作走馬燈  陳亮　　這天大約是飯吃的太飽了，需要散步，樓板上運動，致干未便，而馬路尙焉，然感獨行乏伴，就要求我那拖鼻涕的太保，他欣然從諾。於是口啣烟捲，手牽着手兒，出得門來，好一番新春氣象也。　　我旣志在散步，自然没有目的地，踱着，踱着，太保却有些意興索然了。　　「爹爹，不是上城隍廟去嗎？」他抬着腦袋，睜着眼睛問。　　太保的意思我完全明白，根據「兒童敎育」原則，不忍使他失望，乃變更路程，而到城隍廟，兜了幾個圈子，太保仍未能滿意，思有以安慰之。趨燈肆，太保瞧見了走馬燈，樂甚，我不敢怠慢，購而與之，含笑言旋。　　　到了家裏，太保盯着走馬燈似乎又告失望：「怎麽不會動了呵，剛才這些人不都是會動手動脚的嗎？」我和太保的媽都們着嘴巴笑了，同時，覺得這倒是個很好的敎育機會，就把走馬燈從桌上移到櫈上，解釋着：「癡孩子，你眞的當那夥紙人馬會旋轉活動嗎！剛才在馬路上因爲有風把上面的紙傘吹動了袍你瞧，這騎馬揑刀的將官，這穿着大，大掛的大好老，這挺胸疊肚的英雄，不都貼在這紙傘的四週沿嗎，只要紙傘一轉，他們統神氣活現的動起來了，還有站在前面的兩個勇士，四肢都有頭髮絲縛着，暗暗受紙傘的牽動，現在就只要一支蠟燭火熖的熱力把紙傘激轉，便全會活動起來了。」　　接着，太保的媽又把蠟燭買來點上，作實地試騐，究竟太保天資還不算錯，所以已經頷首領悟了。太保的媽似乎非常得意，以爲她有這樣聰敏的一個孩子，其實，這種極平凡的技巧，年紀大一些的孩子們，就是不解釋，他們自己亦會揭穿的，等於社會上一切黑幕，是不會蒙蔽有閱歷者的眼睛。　　點着一支烟捲，欣賞着這東方藝術的製作。從無意中我又得着一個感覺；「走馬燈是可以象徵某一個社會層的，在世界上」。取締加搭擱樓  三多　　上海有着終年空閉着的大洋宅，而一樓一底的樓房却終年擁塞着各式各樣的三房客，近年來報紙上洋房召租廣告更是加多，這大都市中貧富階級底縣殊就可以從住的方面估計出來。　　自從踏進大都市以來，覺得上海生活程度之高，除了不必需的糜費之外，就吃緊在住的一層。大半的小職員及勞力者至少支出他們進欵的三分之一在睡眠問題上，二房東把一樓一底的房子分成前樓，後樓，亭子間，灶披，晒台，等不是没有理由的：一則果然是加豐他們的進欵，而另一方面亦是便於出租。　　市公安局奉市黨部函切實取締加搭擱樓，有三層理由：一，屋少人多，於衛生，風紀有關；二，因晒台蓋搭樓棚，致洗滌衣被等物，沿街晾晒，有碍觀瞻；三，此等樓棚，材料盡爲木柱板條，易生火災。處在雙重壓迫下的三房客早亦感覺到這種痛苦，不過爲了房價的高貴，就不得已過着鴿棚生活。所以記者覺得取締擱樓僅是消極辦法；要避免以上三項危險，而顧全細民生計自然以减低房租爲上策，在大房東不過减少有限的進欵，而三房客則受惠多矣。自我職業介紹　　毛執中美術家，曾任培麟行廣告部主任，擅長繪畫，攝影，小品文藝等，願擔任商家廣告師，學校或家庭美術敎師，及新生活衣食住等代爲設計美術化，月薪不計，通訊處上海跑馬廳路一七三號美術講習座，或上海，航運，電台轉。　　筱風女士，年二十餘，大學畢業，擅長國文藝術，曾任滬上各中學敎員及主任職，茲願就一相當位置，通訊處西摩路慈惠里二二號徐君轉。　　范君，年十九，浙江人，初級師範科畢業，中文清通，書法秀麗，曾任小學敎職及文化機關書記等職，茲願任小學敎員及抄寫等職務，有意者，請函天通庵顧家灣寰球製帽廠宋君收轉。　　某君，年二十，藝專卒業，如有小學需聘藝術敎員，請函閘北三陽路五一六號林懇轉。　　曼女士，年二十六歲，浙江杭縣人，大學畢業，曾任敎員多年，擅長國文史地等科，現願任學校或家庭敎員之職，通訊處西摩路慈惠里二十二號胡女士轉。　　薛敏君，年二十六歲，江蘇籍，商業學校畢業，能操滬語，國語，英語，曾服務本埠商界多年，現願就工廠，公司，商店，機關之會計，文牘，書記，庶務等職，薪金不計，且有殷實舖保，如有需要上項職員者請卽函本埠浙江路清和坊十一號朱翔君轉。　　某君，年十八歲，江蘇青浦縣人，曾在青浦縣立初中卒業，現擬謀一練習生或寫算等職，待遇不計，並備有殷實舖保，凡公司行號以及各界團體機關如欲雇用者，請函本埠曹家渡南首民　米號高寳成君接洽。　　某女士，寗波人，年四十歲左右，粗通國學，曾任家庭敎師有年，現如各大公館無論本埠外埠如須聘請家庭敎師或保姆訓導十歲以下小孩者，卽請來函接洽，薪金以十五元爲最低限度，通訊處上海施高塔路恒豐里四十九號忻魯存收。　　余大寗君，皖黟人，十七歲，初中程度，茲願任公司工廠銀行練習生及報館校對員等職，薪金不計，具有殷實舗保，如有意者，請函南市如意街十七號接洽。　　嘯虹女士，年二十四歲，杭縣人，大學畢業，曾任中學敎員多年，現願就一相當位置，如各界需要是項人才，請賜函申報業餘週刋轉。　　張澤君，蘇藉，大夏中學高中師範科畢業，歷任光夏中學附小敎導主任中華兒童敎育社編輯明達小學敎務主任等職，今願就抄寫校對家庭敎師以及上列等職，報酬不計，通訊處上海曹家渡西光復路三○五三號樓上。無綫電播音莭目歌唱　　上海無綫電劇社　　永生（一○八○）下午四時半至五時半　　春宵膩舞曲（姚莉）今夜曲（曼娜）慈母搖籃曲（露茜）漁光曲（麗影）催眠曲（曼娜）湖夜招魂曲（露茜）花心曲（姚莉）　　大中華（一一六○）下午八時至九時　　鳳求凰（姚莉）小寳貝（露茜）特别快車（曼娜）春風回來吧（麗影）賣花詞（露茜）薔薇花底（娜莉）牆裏牆外（曼娜）　　飛音社　　華興（一二六○）下午六時至七時　　賣報歌（兪月明）人間仙子（曼娜）梅花接老爺（露茜）小寳寳（佈德）飛花歌（兪月明）小東西（曼娜）嫖給勇士吧（露茜）　　星光競音社　　東方（一○二○）下午六時十分至七時　　怨鴛怨（胡瑛）特别快車（黃喋）歸程（游泳）乳娘曲（競芳）夜深深（胡瑛）吾願意（游泳）慈母搖籃曲（黃喋）丁香山（競芳）　　富星（九二○）下午七時三刻至八時半　　勇士新歌（胡瑛）南海美人（游泳）摩登戀愛（黃喋）吾什麽除得你（競芳）野草閒花（胡瑛黃喋）寄給夕現的詩（游泳）特别快車（黃喋）舟中曲（競芳）　　利利（一二四○）下午十時十分至十一時　　娘子軍（胡瑛）從軍去（游泳）永遠親愛（黃喋）吾的愛人就是你（競芳薛陶）催眠曲（胡瑛）愛情和玫瑰（游泳）蘇情牧羊（黃喋）蘇三哪（競芳）　　玫瑰團　　中西（一○四○）下午八時三刻至九時半　　平沙落雁（前奏）黃浦江（張如）賣油條（曼麗）鳳陽歌（王蝶）永遠親愛（雯仙）給摩登小姐（玲玲）第一次相見（楊曾恕張如）南海美人（曼麗）　　安定（八六○）下午十時至十一時　　漢宮秋月（前奏）人間仙子（張如）相見訴想思（曼麗）小寳寳（王蝶）好妹妹（玲玲）我的愛人就是你（雯仙周恭）粉紅色的夢（張如曼麗）　　夜鶯藝社　　國華（一二○○）下午九時至十時　　光明之路（黛蕾）姊妹花（露茜）爲了同胞與國防（佩婷）昭君怨（曼麗）别矣巴黎（佩婷王眞）休息五分鐘（露茜）常武牧羊（黛蕾）吹泡泡（曼娜）話劇　　觀音社　　中西（一○四○）下午七時一刻至八時　　「空谷蘭」　　柔云眞狠心，她把良彥的藥水搶去了；這是與良彥的生命有關係的，紉珠怎麽肯放過呢？所以立刻跟蹤而至，在樓上演了一齣全武行的把戲。結果，是紉珠勝利了，良彥也有救了，可是柔云走了。　　中華（一一四○）下午八時一刻至九時　　　　「皇后的丈夫」　　旦光劇社表演一幕「臥薪嘗胆」的話劇，把一個大學敎授汪洋，忙得不亦樂乎。演完了戲，闊少金雲鵬想追求皇后陶慧瑛，請陶慧瑛去吃飯，爲了這事，旦光大學又有一塲大風波。彈詞　　蔣如庭朱介生落金扇　　中華（一一四○）下午九時至九時三刻　　開篇「珠珍塔見娘」　　青衣婢，祿衣僮，出園从一路去匆匆，思想松亭姑丈會，今朝喜得代大恭，白雲菴近聲聲叩，衆尼姑不解内奇踪，陽服黃冠個小道僮，方老夫人親說喚，方卿是膝前跪下淚雙流，不孝孩兒該萬死，自知作事太愚曚，南陽道，片雪逢，歸心如箭返開對，刦去行囊身蓋雪，畢中書救兒大恩公，欵留再四京都去，平安書寄轉家中，可恨畢　躭誤我，以至於親娘道路窮，說到碧梧堂方畢聯秦晋，岳王故當面結乘龍。冒名冒姓三及第，陳情一本奏九重，天恩骨肉再相逢，聽得采姑心有憂，親上加親禮欠通，祿秋亭中表姊多情重，畢氏恩親代不公，正要言談知縣接，畢陳兩姓欠家僮，靈姓心使女看姣容。　　姚小庵王萍秋麒麟豹　　中西（一○四○）下午十一時至十二時　　開篇「春愁曲」　　斜陽入院峭寒生。空寂繡房寳鴨溫。惜别思春春院照。侵尋夢影够消魂。　　病起梳妝懶。中酒扶頭瘦不禁。想到昨夜燈花纔報喜。但是佳期淺淡不分明。可喜鸚哥意吟詩澀。但是燕子心癈訴恨頻。早已是二十四番風花寄信。只是游絲亂絮閣紗欞。曾記得游圍踏遍平蕪路。一種情憐刻骨深。曾記得自在簾鉤書館靜。棠唸送過打栱聲。曾記得十三鈿柱琴挑剔。玉潤珠圓眞是白雪音。曾記得屏底猧兒窺醉眼。瑤台人醒鳳釵橫。那一日淹袂淹袂陽關道。馬滑霜濃月下行。到如今欲遺青青河畔草。將愁直到短長亭。只落得裁衣蜂蝶無聊賴。倫買胭脂抱落英。取以目斷橋邊烟水綠。木蘭堂北，踐殘春。埋怨東皇𢖼費心�古文　　馮明權國學　　中西（一○四○）上午八時至九時　　韓愈佛骨表（續）　　伏維睿聖文武皇帝陞下。神聖英武數千百年已來。未有倫比即位之初。即不許廢人爲僧尼道士。又不許創立寺觀。臣常以爲高祖之志必行於陞下之手。今縱未能即行。豈可恣之轉令盛也。今聞陞下令羣僧迎佛骨於鳳翔。御樓以觀。舁入大内。又令諸寺遞近供食。臣雖至愚。必知陞下不惑於佛。作此崇奉以祈福祥也。直以年豐人。樂徇人之心。爲京都士庶設詭異之觀。戲翫之具耳。安有聖明若此。而肯信此等事哉。　　上午九時至九時三十分（唐詩）杜秋娘金縷衣。　　勸君莫惜金縷衣！勸君須惜少年時！花開堪折直須折！莫待無花空折枝！　　下午一時至二時（孟子盡心）楊子取爲我

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊一些臨時演員所必需具有的知識（上）  細流　　派拉蒙影片公司不久之前，在美國各處舉行了各種美貌競賽，選擇了許多青年男女，將他們送到了好萊塢。他們在好萊塢，經過了一番二番的鏡頭試騐之後，就在其取中了幾位特殊的人才。其餘不中選的，都按照合同上的規定，資遣回籍去了。但是有二十四個青年男女，却逗留在好萊塢不肯回鄕去。當然，派拉蒙公司當局，雖然恐怕他們流落他鄕，但亦不能用武力將他們一槪押解回去，亦祇要聽之而已。　　要是你明白人類天性的話，你决不全怪那些青年男女的。他們來的時候，是抱着决心，要在銀幕上成功的。他們豈肯不試一試，就契然回去呢？　　倘使你告訴他們，他們是没有成功的希望的，他們亦不會相信你的話的。他們已經將好萊塢的歷史從頭至尾，讀得爛熟。他們深知大明星之中，某某某某的開始，亦不過是些臨時演員。他們亦没有憑藉什麽勢力，亦没有人拉攏，但憑辛苦工作而成名了。他們事先亦並没有什麽表演的經騐。他們的相貌，亦是平平的。他們的知識學問，亦没有什麽過人之處。從前可以的，難道現在輪到這班青年男女頭上，就不興了嗎？　　他們歷歷舉着當今鼎鼎大名的人物，如理查阿倫，蘇卡珞兒，弗蘭昔司提，莎麗愛鸞，　爾斯法雷，珍尼蓋諾，克拉克蓋博，琪恩哈羅，安尼妲路易絲，瑪琳尼克蓀，雷門諾伐羅，　蘇薛茨，愛麗絲懷德，洛麗妲楊等等，那一個從前不是一個臨時演員。誰能告訴這般勇氣勃勃的青年男女，說在好萊塢做臨時演員，是没有前途的呢？所以他們旣不願就此失望回家，願意在好萊塢各家影片公司裏，尋些零碎工作做做，倒不如給他們一些有用的敎訓，讓他們好知道做零碎角色，或臨時演員的訣　。以下就是他們所應知道的一些東西。　　現在在好萊塢，美貌並不是必需品，雖然於你是件很有用的東西。强健的身體，是最要緊的。要經得起臨時演員的繁劇，一定要有健碩的體格。他自己不知道，要在晚上工作，或是白天工作，在海裏工作，或是在沙漠裏工作，在太陽裏工作，或是在狂風暴雨中工作。今天他在雪臘山頂深雪之中，明天亦許在死亡谷烈熖熏炙之中。要没有强健的體格，怎能經得住這種急劇的變換；　　學問好敎育是很有用的，但是他却不必一定要是一位大學畢業生。不過中人以上的常識和智慧，是不可缺少的。有人問，那些銀幕上永遠看不見，永遠聽不到的臨時演員，爲什麽要具有中人以上的常識智慧呢？就因爲他是明星的陪襯他的知識一定亦要陪襯得上。　　不管一個演員，是屬於那一類的角色，如果他要繼續工作下去，他應當時時觀察，體騐，學習，和操練。譬如他已經被定爲「强盜派」了，他所知道的，不僅在能說幾句「切口」，他一定要知道强盜是怎樣打扮的，怎樣走路，怎樣說話，怎樣動作，以及怎樣反動。他非但要能說强盜說的語言，還一定要說得逼眞，使觀衆們聽得懂。　　那就是說，要是一個臨時演員，還没有會背誦對白之前，一定要先學習起來，你或者以爲臨時演員是用不着開口的。那你就錯誤了。從前的臨時演員，是用不着開口的，但是現在的頭等臨時演員，都是能開口而常常開口的。從他進公司的大門，一直到散班的時候爲止，其中的光陰，都是屬於公司的。倘使導演臨時要叫你說一兩句簡單的對白的時候，你就應當事先有些準備，要是你是實在有志於電影事業的話。　　當然，有許多傲慢無禮的臨時演員，當導演要他說對白的時候，他會睜大了眼睛，對着導演道：「你怎不去找正式演員去？」他以爲他拿了臨時演員的錢，而呌他做正式演員的工作，那是導演有時欺侮他，而不知導演選中了他，叫他開口，是帮助她，給他一個機會去顯露他實在的才能。麥蒂芬，一個紐約來的小孩子，偶然被導演看見了，叫他說一句話。那句話說得好，導演就提拔了他，給他在第二張片子裏，扮一個很重要的角色。現在派拉蒙想給他一個長期合同。别家公司亦想用他，稱他爲喬治賴甫脫第二。那不都是從偶然的開口得來的嗎。（未完）影片談評評「小情人」  凌鶴　　ＢrightEyeg｜大光明　　在秀蘭鄧波兒主演的影片中，我以爲這是較好的一部，最少這是很能使人感動的。自然，這種動人的力量，乃是由於劇本所决定的。在這裏劇作者和秀蘭以前所有的作品一樣，將她作爲一個貧窮的女孩而出現，爲了適合她的個性的原故。在這裏她是一個幼年喪父的女孩，這使她很懂得傷感。因爲她聰明伶俐的原故，她博得了好些人的歡心；有的是老年的有錢人，更多的是飛機駕駛人員了。她跟着爲人帮傭的母親過活，由於人性愛的崇高，她給與了人們不少歡愉。可是不久，她的母親又不幸身死，這使她成爲孤苦無告的小孩，雖然最後她是得着了人們的保養。　　從這一故事中，導演是發揮了她演戲的天才，在前部　愉快的天眞，給與觀衆的印象是深深的啟發了成年人的天眞的愛，而這種愛是我們在現實折磨中所不易接觸的。就戲劇效果來說，這裏强調了歡愉的描寫，對於後來的悲哀之襯托，却是最好的方法，於是當她的母親慘死之後，這死訊傳給飛機駕駛者之羣的時候，恰是空中慶祝會的興高采烈，極爲熱鬧的當時，人們心中都突然的感受不可遏止的隱痛，可是天眞的她却不知道這一惡耗，她依然是天眞的歌唱，而對照的乃是人們同情心的辛酸，忍不住的流出眼淚。這種刺戟的力量，確是很電影藝術的地表現。以後又將調了輕鬆下去，一直到暴風雨之後，自飛機下躍，成爲劇的高潮，這種地方似乎還嫌不够，倒不如她决心出走的當時寫得深刻。至於法庭的一塲，却無特殊好處，雖然這俗套的戀愛，丨團圓丨並不生硬到不可耐的程度。　　對於劇中人個情最成功的描寫，我以爲是奈特斯密士叔叔。這固然因爲那脾氣怪厲的老頭子太典型了，而編劇或者導演就把握住這一點，由於演員恰如其份的傳達出來。很顯然的，這一老頭子的描寫成功，使「小情人」爲之生色不少。　　自然我不能否認這一影片還有許多缺點，至少如亞蝶自飛機塲回家，中間經過戲再接着目擊秀蘭母親之死，至少在時間性上頗不調恊。又如在空中開慶祝會的種種，也不見生動等等。至於主題的指示是什麽呢？本來這是美國影片通常不大顧及的，而這裏除了描寫了小孩兒的天眞，以及促起人們對於零丁孤苦的小孩之撫育的熱情，乃是不曾有更積極的指示的，當世界已經實現了兒童公育的時候。　　「風流案」中之茂娜洛埃與尤娜茂凱爾｜南京映倉隱秋嘴上的瘡  青雲　　「一個努力電影藝術的藝人，是應該忠實的努力他的藝術，不應該爭求名次的高低，和拒絶演不重要的角色」。　　上面的話，便是我們倉隱秋小姐說的，從他這短短的話中，我們對她不能不肅然起敬，她不愧是一個忠實藝術的藝人。　　她在「女人」「人間仙子」中所飾的兩個個性不同的儍大姐，事實上是均獲得了極優美的成功，也是證明了她最適宜扮飾這類的角色。最近在巴黎月光兩大戲院同時開映的藝華有聲對白歌唱片「新婚的前夜」中，她也是飾一個儍氣重的女僕，而又獲得了不平凡的成就，有一幕她報告他的主人李阿毛博士一叚秘密事件，他主人不相信，她便急得亂發誓，道：「我如果騙了你，我的嘴上就生那麽大那麽大······的瘡癤。同時用手比喻其大，李阿毛博士見了她那副儍像，也不禁爲之失笑。百言集  林擒　　㈠　　國片參加俄國影展，確是一件可喜的事情，希望國人勿以此自滿，應當扶助製片者，如何使國片在世界影壇上佔一個地位。　　㈡　　從各公司聽到裁員的消息，使我發生了兩個感想：第一是從業員們一點保障都没有嗎？第二是證明了中國製片界的確不景氣呵！　　㈢　　看了「玩意世界」，證明了該片所用的道具完全是爲該片而特製的。　　㈣　　看起來某一個演員是很平凡的，但是要在許多新人中找出幾個像某一個演員那樣平凡地的，又是不容易了。電影小說塊肉餘生（Ｄavid　Copperfield）（五）  柳村　　有一天，大衛正在整理行裝，想出門安度假日，那位脅肩謟笑，歷年不變的尤利亞喜迫，忽然送了一封信進來。大衛拆開一看，原來是他的老友密司脫密考伯寄給他的。密司脫密考伯和密昔司密考伯，和他們的兒女以及那克立格，這時住在坎𢖼白雷一家小客棧裏。他們拖欠了房金，房東又恐嚇他們，要送他們到監牢裏去了。但是他們永久是無憂無慮的。後來大衛就替密考伯找到了一些事做。　　那事亦是尤利亞喜迫給他的，因爲喜迫現在經管了威克菲而事業的一大部份，成了威克菲而惟一的親信了。大衛在安排好了老友之後，就動身到倫敦，去和司蒂爾福司相會。司蒂爾福司是大衛的同學老友，亦是他平素在學校裏所最崇拜的一個人。　　倫敦是豪華無化的地方了。司蒂爾福司接到了一位小同學，就不得不略盡地主之誼，請他到劇塲去看戲。他們二仍年少翩翩，著了脫服，戴上高帽，披上斗蓬，眞是一對璧人。當他們走進劇塲門口的時候，大衛一心想賞鑒賞鑒他平素所未嘗寓目的清歌妙舞，但是等到侍者將他們引進了一間包廂的時候，大衛的一雙眼睛，却被隔隣包廂裏坐着的一位女郎吸引了去了。他所看見的却是舉世無雙的美人。她的一顰一笑，一言一動，都使大衛的心神爲之顚倒，但是她旁邊，却坐着兩位陪伴的婦人，那是司蒂爾福司叫她們是兩條老龍的。大衛一心想念，怎能和她交換一句話，雖死亦心甘。他不時掉過頭去，呆呆地看着那位妙曼女郎，歌舞一切都不在他的心上了。　　司蒂爾福司到底年長些，世故人情懂得多些，對於女人的閱歷亦深些。他不久就設法和她們接談起來，借給她們千里鏡，以及交換了他們自己比較好些的座位。這樣他們就佔了絶對的勝利，等到戲散的時候，那兩條老龍丨原來是那女郎的兩位姑母裝扮的丨居然感激不盡，請他們得空去拜訪她們去。大衛這才知道那女郎的芳名，叫做都拉司本路。這時他們已經自頂至踵，沉溺於爰河之中了。　　她是女人之中，最可愛而最會嬌羞無那的了。她對他好像亦是芳心許可的了。等到幾個禮拜過去，他更加沉溺得不可救藥了。當她逗着一隻小小的芙蓉雀唱歌的時候，大衛不覺私自歎了一口氣，天下再有比這個更美麗的事没有？都拉的嬌羞。都拉的憨疵。都拉有時對着她的小尤吉迫嬌嗔着，都拉的輕憐密爰。都拉的喃喃嬰兒之聲。她叫着他「都迪」，他心爲之鎔化了。她輕輕地，甜甜地吻着他，他甘心作她的奴隸了。但是他却預先約好了司蒂爾福司，一同到鴉墨司去度夏，順便訪問他的一班壁各德家的老友。這樣生生地呌他離開都拉，差不多使他心碎了。　　等到牠們到了鴉墨司，那所船屋仍舊還安然存在。一班朋友，還都安好。他們雖然每人都長大人些，蒼老了些，但還都很歡樂地同居着丨他自己親愛的壁各德老漁，漢姆，密昔司根密支和小愛密柳。司蒂爾福司和大衛到那裏的時候，正是漢姆和小愛密柳訂婚的佳日良辰。全屋子慶祝着，歡呼之聲差不多要將船掀翻了。他們歡迎着老友大衛，他們亦同樣熱烈地歡迎着生人司蒂爾福司。　　這樣，甜香醉人的長夏，一天一天地慢慢過去。大衛雖然遠離了都拉，也還可以快樂地遊蕩着。不過他却在和司蒂爾福司談話之中，發現了他前此所未注意到的一點，就是司蒂爾福司狡獪無情的地方。這漸漸使他深感不安起來。（未完）</p>

<h3>Sichuan Provincial Government Established in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Issues a Declaration Emphasizing Three Points</p>
<p>Citywide Celebration with Airplanes Soaring</p>
<p>He Guoguang Represents Chiang in Delivering Admonitory Remarks</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Sichuan Provincial Government was established in Chongqing on the tenth. Liu Xiang issued a declaration emphasizing three points: 1. Diligently seek governance, atone for past mistakes, and strive for merit; 2. Strengthen the government and eliminate the remaining bandits; 3. Achieve unification and eliminate separatism, abolish harsh and miscellaneous taxes, and alleviate the suffering of the people. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The swearing-in ceremony for the Sichuan Provincial Government members and the establishment ceremony of the new provincial government were held at the Governor-General's Office at noon on the tenth. On the morning of the tenth, provincial government slogans were posted all over the streets of the city. Arches decorated with cypress branches and colored lanterns were erected in the bustling areas, and county flags were hung with lanterns to celebrate the establishment of the provincial government and the victory over the bandits. Airplanes soared through the sky, scattering various celebratory leaflets. More than a thousand people attended the ceremony. At the appointed time, cannons were fired, music was played, and the ceremony was conducted according to protocol. The Executive Yuan sent Xie Shengtang, President of the Sichuan High Court, and Chairman Chiang sent He Guoguang to supervise the oath-taking. Each delivered admonitory remarks, followed by a response from Chairman Liu Xiang. Guests Xie Zuomin, Shao Congen, and Hu Wenlan all gave speeches. The ceremony concluded at 1 PM with a group photo. He's admonitory remarks briefly stated that the arrival of bandits such as Xu, Zhang, Zhu, and Mao in Sichuan was due to the poor political situation in Sichuan, which created an opportunity for them to exploit. Therefore, bandit suppression must rely on seventy percent politics. The central government entrusted the Sichuan administration to Chairman Liu, and assisted him with the power of the central government, hoping for effective results. Now, it is necessary to be open and transparent, select the virtuous and capable, purify the bureaucracy, severely punish corruption, eliminate harsh and miscellaneous taxes, promote production, and eliminate harmful substances. Under the unified government, follow the right path and reduce paperwork, and work diligently. As for administrative steps, during the bandit suppression period, bandit suppression should be the focus, such as organizing baojia, building roads, revitalizing the countryside, and providing relief to refugees. After the bandit suppression military operations are completed, then embark on the path of construction. Finally, he hoped that Chairman Liu and the committee members would proceed with fairness, integrity, diligence, speed, and determination, and that the new provincial government would vigorously implement a new lifestyle, and that all sectors of the public would support the new provincial government.

<h3>The Panchen Establishes the Western Frontier Pacification Office in Alxa Banner</h3>
<p>Alxa Banner Wangfu: The Panchen Lama recently established the Western Frontier Pacification Office in this banner and issued a circular telegram, which read (Titles Omitted): Greetings to all, I, the Panchen Erdeni, was previously appointed by the Central Government as the Western Frontier Pacification Envoy, and on December 24, 21st year of the Republic, I respectfully took the oath of office in the National Government Hall. I should have established an office and taken office as soon as possible. However, due to years of pacifying Mongolia and Xinjiang, hoping to unite the five races and save the country from disaster, I have not had time to organize it until now. Now that I am about to return to Tibet and approach the western frontier, the pacification affairs are becoming increasingly complex. Therefore, I established the office in Alxa Banner on the eighth of this month, and also put the official seal into use on that day. I will move westward with the seasons, govern according to the times, communicate the people's feelings, and promote the principles, using the heart of Bodhi to universally bestow education, pacify the border areas according to the central government's intentions. I am afraid that my talent is light and my responsibilities are heavy, and that I am unable to fulfill my duties. I hope that all contemporary sages and advanced members of our party will give me advice and correct me with strength. In addition to reporting the establishment of this office to the National Government for record, I respectfully submit this telegram for your consideration. Panchen Erdeni kowtows and presents the seal. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Derelict County Magistrate Detained Awaiting Trial</p>

<h3>Refugees from Western Shandong to Migrate and Cultivate Low-Lying Areas of the Lower Yellow River</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Tonight, Director of Construction Zhang Honglie and Commander of the People's Corps Zhao Mingyuan discussed the migration of refugees from western Shandong to cultivate the low-lying areas of Lijin and Zhanhua in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. It was decided to relocate 7,000 refugees, including 3,000 from Shouzhang, 2,000 from Fan County, and 1,000 each from Pu County and Yanggu, giving each person 50 mu of land for cooperative cultivation, which could cultivate 3,500 hectares. In addition to the agricultural tools and livestock brought by the refugees, loans for seeds and food will be provided, totaling 270,000 yuan. The funds have been raised. Zhao and Zhang will visit Han on the 11th to finalize the plan and implement it this spring. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Inland Silver Transport Still Allowed Free Circulation</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Will Formulate Remedial Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to prohibit the export of silver, the Ministry of Finance required that the inland transport of silver by various banks and firms must also be approved by the Ministry and issued a permit before it could be transported. Later, the business community was allowed to submit a request to temporarily handle it in a flexible manner during the general collection and remittance. Now that the period for the general collection and remittance has passed, the temporary measures have become ineffective. However, the business community and the financial industry have repeatedly requested that the adjustment of the rural economy be taken into consideration. Except for various ports, the inland transport of silver is allowed to circulate freely. Therefore, the temporary measures are still applicable to the inland transport of silver, and in order to prevent abuses, remedial measures will be formulated separately to show restrictions.

<h3>Hubei Provincial Government Determines Post-Recovery Guidelines for Recovered Areas</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Provincial Government has decided to convene a provincial administrative conference to discuss the reform of county administration plans.

Orders have been issued to comply. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Reducing the Tax on Foreign Rice Cannot Be Confirmed</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, foreign merchants have widely spread rumors that the Ministry of Finance will reduce the import tax on foreign rice from 1.75 to one gold unit. However, when inquiring with those in charge of the Ministry of Finance, they replied that this matter could not be confirmed. Perhaps, because the French ambassador requested a reduction in the import tax on Vietnamese rice, this rumor has spread by association. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) More than 300 bandits under Liu Guitang, who were disrupting the area around Yutian Guoluozhuang, Wolugu Fort, and Wangxianzhuang, have been suppressed by the Zhang Yinting unit of the militia for several days. The bandits have been dispersed and fled to the border between Ji and Yu. The militia consumed more than 30,000 rounds of ammunition, and seventeen militiamen were killed or injured. In order to prevent the militia from retaliating, the Yutian Security Supplementary Team expanded its organization of the Lin Nancang teams and made every effort to incorporate bandits. The Wang Bingxiao unit of the militia absorbed scattered bandits from Liu Guitang's unit, collected civilian guns, and expanded its unit to 800 men in Yanshankou. Both sides still intend to fight each other. The provincial government urged the War Zone Clearance Committee to negotiate with the Japanese side as soon as possible so that the newly編 Special Police Team can enter the area as soon as possible to quell the chaos and avoid the expansion of the situation.

<h3>The Far East Issue of Concern to Britain, America and Japan</h3>
<p>Since Frenchmen Flandin and Laval joined hands to travel west and hold talks between Britain and France in London, the British foreign policy seems to have focused all its efforts on dealing with the problems on the European continent. However, at the same time, it has never forgotten the intricate nature of the Far East issue. This is because there is a close relationship between the two. The Tokyo Daily News reported the other day that the Japanese Foreign Minister replied to a question from a Japanese member of parliament, saying, "In the current world situation, the possibility of a British-Japanese alliance is worth considering by the government." Is this statement merely a one-sided propaganda by the Japanese side? Or is it already able to deeply understand the inside story and true intentions of the British? It is not something we can know. However, when members of the British House of Commons questioned the safety of aviation in China, they also expressed concern about the Far East situation. It can be seen that the British are concerned about the Far East issue.</p>
<p>Today, the Far East has become the center of competition among the powers. The complexity of the relationship is difficult to investigate. The most concerned about the interests is Britain. And the most hesitant and uncertain attitude is also Britain. Because it has vast economic interests in the Far East, from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean, all belong to its sphere of influence. In the past, it allied with Japan to resist Imperial Russia and abolished the alliance to get closer to the United States. All these changes depended on whether Britain's position in the Far East was consolidated or not. Now, the situation against Russia is no longer what it used to be. If it wants to rebuild its old friendship with Japan, it will inevitably have all kinds of concerns. If it wants to unite with the United States, there are also obstacles. This is why the British are hesitant and indecisive about the Far East issue.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of its own interests, the most fierce competitor with Britain in the Far East market is Japan. Looking at places like India, the Netherlands, and Siam, the expansion of Japan's economic power can be seen everywhere, which is enough to chill the hearts of the British and reduce their eagerness to engage in alliance with Japan. Looking at the recent British authorities, on the one hand, they are preventing the rise of the Far Eastern people's demand for interests, reforming the Indian constitution to strengthen their rule over India, and on the other hand, they are urgently repairing military bases in the Far East and reorganizing air force preparations. All these show their close concern for Far Eastern interests. Yesterday, a Havas London telegram said that Japanese Naval Minister Osumi issued a statement, intending to ask Britain and the United States to stop or limit the naval base in Singapore and the defensive works of the Hawaiian Islands. People here regard it as a probing nature. The official authorities either think it can be ignored or think it is difficult to accept. According to a Washington telegram from the National News Agency, the American side also criticized this news in various newspapers. One newspaper said, "The reason cited by the Japanese newspaper (that is, the Japanese newspaper that published the declaration of the Japanese Naval Minister) is completely wrong. The newspaper believes that Hawaii and Singapore are within the scope of the Washington Treaty. In fact, the above-mentioned bases and Alaska have special provisions and are not subject to the restrictions of the treaty." It also said, "The Washington Treaty stipulates that Britain and the United States can each freely establish defenses in Hawaii and Singapore." It can be seen that this Far East status is not only of concern to Britain, but the United States also pays great attention to the views and status of the two countries, which are very similar.</p>
<p>There is another point to note, that is, Britain and the United States have a tendency to further cooperate because of the similarity of their status and views. A New York telegram from the National News Agency described Lord Lytton's speech at the Political Education Federation on the issue of the Three-Power Naval Talks, recognizing the Far East issue as one of the important political issues. The general idea is that "the people of Britain and the United States should have a frank discussion. If they want to eliminate the crisis that harms world peace, cooperation between Britain and the United States is essential." Later, he further said, "Britain and the United States should eliminate suspicious mentality when dealing with this issue. As far as Britain is concerned, the friendship between Britain and Japan makes the British sympathize with Japan's economic situation, which makes Americans suspicious of Britain's words and deeds. As far as the United States is concerned, Britain is a member of the League of Nations, while the United States is not, which makes the British unable to trust the intentions of the United States and doubts the extent to which Americans are willing to take responsibility for solving the Far East issue. However, all suspicions are unfounded because the obligations borne by the two countries are bound by treaties." These words are even more important. Lord Lytton can clearly reveal the suspicious mentality of the two countries, Britain and the United States, then the misunderstanding of this mentality can be completely eliminated in the future, and cooperation will be easier to carry out. And the situation of the British-Japanese alliance is getting farther and farther. According to today's Chicago telegram from the National News Agency, Saito, the Japanese ambassador to the United States, delivered a speech to the Association for Foreign Relations today, saying that Japan's Far East policy aims to prevent the invasion of China by Western political and military forces. It can be seen that Japan's Far East policy still insists as before and is incompatible with Britain and the United States. This is the observation of the recent expressions of various parties on the Far East situation. How will it change in the future? How can we know?</p>
<h3>The U.S. Government Requests Appropriation to Establish Defenses on the Pacific Coast</h3>
<p>Establish an Air Force Base in Hawaii</p>
<p>Japan's Suspicions are Unnecessary and Troublesome</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's news, the Budget Bureau has recommended to Congress to allocate US$11 million to build a major air force base in Hawaii. This recommendation is outside the official army budget and within President Roosevelt's $300 million public construction plan. The government also recommended to the House Appropriations Committee to allocate $2 million to build coastal air defenses in various places. It is said that this fund will be used to add anti-aircraft guns to Hawaii and Alaska. There is also a proposal for $8 million to build barracks at various army posts. Generally, the House Appropriations Committee will soon approve these recommendations. The funds required for these recommendations will be drawn from the federal regular construction costs and not within the $400 million temporary relief fund. The Appropriations Committee has now sent these recommendations to the House Army Committee for reference. The committee has already approved them after discussing them with Chief of Staff MacArthur and others. The content of the proposal is kept secret, but it is reported that part of the funds for the Hawaiian Air Force Base will be used to build a large airship base. It is believed that this airport can also be used for Pacific airship commercial flights. House Army Committee Chairman McSwain said that the construction of the Hawaiian Air Force Base was approved three or four years ago, but it was not implemented due to lack of funds. The Budget Bureau's recommendation this time has no military intention to invade others and is completely the same as building defenses in Pearl Harbor, New York, and the Golden Gate. If other countries have suspicious thoughts, it will become a huge misunderstanding. McSwain's words are referring to Japan's suspicions. At the same time, House Naval Committee Chairman Vinson also announced that part of the $300 million in public construction funds will be allocated to the construction projects of naval bases in Pearl Harbor and the Pacific coast. The amount required for the Atlantic coast will be very small. Representative Whels also said that his proposal to build air force bases in ten important locations in the United States will be passed as soon as possible. (National News on the 9th)</p>
<h3>The United States Actively Expands its Air Force Strength</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the news released by the War Department today, the first experiment of the General Headquarters Air Force will be held in early March, that is, ten army bombers will fly to Panama, landing once on the way. At the same time, senior army officers such as Chief of Staff MacArthur said that the army still needs 880 new aircraft in addition to those specified in the budget to bring the air force strength to the planned limit of 2,320 aircraft. Of this number, 1,000 should belong to the General Headquarters Air Force. (National News on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Saito Plays with his Tongue Again</h3>
<p>Claims Self-Defense in Manchuria</p>
<p>Revealing Hegemonic Ambitions</p>
<p>Chicago - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito delivered a speech to the Association for Foreign Relations today, saying that Japan's Far East policy aims to prevent the invasion of China by Western political and military forces. Saito solemnly pointed out the danger from the Soviet Russia, saying that Soviet Russia has now included Outer Mongolia, and Xinjiang seems to be within the sphere of influence of Soviet Russia. Therefore, it rejects the construction of naval bases by Western countries. Such as the Soviet Russia's base in Lushun and Germany's base in Qingdao, are all related to this policy. Before the situation in China causes foreign coveting, Japan must be prepared to deal with any eventuality. As early as 1925, Soviet Russia had already violated the Portsmouth Treaty, inciting Chinese to exclude foreigners, resulting in the Japanese having to take self-defense actions in Manchuria. Saito then re-emphasized the issue of extraterritorial rights in China, saying that Japan sincerely hopes that the Chinese government can give foreigners sufficient protection so that foreign governments can withdraw their troops stationed in China as soon as possible. And on this point, we deeply sympathize with China, because we also suffered the pain of extraterritorial rights when we first communicated with Western countries. (National News on the 9th)</p>

<h3>Important Figures from Various Countries Deliver Speeches Calling for International Cooperation</h3>
<p>British and French Unity Aims to End Wars</p>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Both Countries Respond in Unison</p>
<p>Smuts Advocates British-American Cooperation</p>
<p>Goering Demands Armed Peace</p>
<p>(London) Today, major figures around the world gave speeches on increasing peace, the most noteworthy of which was the speech delivered by Prussian Prime Minister Goering to the masses during his official visit to Tesden, which included "Re-arming Germany is the best guarantee of peace in Europe. A senior British military officer recently asked Germany what it would do for peace. I replied, "The greatest thing Germany can do is to re-arm." and "If the sword is lost, then peace is also lost," etc.</p>
<p>The next moving speech was delivered by South African General Smuts to the South African International Affairs Society. The general said that the actual cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Pacific to maintain China's territorial integrity and future peace is the most important step that can be taken regarding international affairs today. Unless the United States agrees to cooperate with other countries on economic sanctions, such as isolating aggressors, the Paris Peace Treaty will still be believed by people. Great Britain, no matter what, must know that in any future urgency, supporting any resolution of the League of Nations will not lead to a conflict with the United States in the sea. The general concluded by saying that the declaration made by former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson on the Peace Treaty should be clarified to make it the basis of actual policy so that those who are not members of the League of Nations or who have no cumulative responsibilities can also trust this policy, etc.</p>
<p>British Foreign Minister Simon also delivered a sincere speech at the British Chamber of Commerce in Paris last night, calling on all countries to cooperate to promote peace. Simon mentioned the success of the recent talks between the British and French authorities in London, and solemnly stated that the work of the two countries is not aimed at dealing with any country, saying, "Our purpose is not a limited understanding, but to put forward suggestions as a basis for free and equal negotiations between all parties concerned to promote the peace and happiness of all parties, so that the institution of peace can be built and on the most solid and beautiful foundation, such as the public recognition that we are working in this spirit, and if the countries we invite can also negotiate with us in this great spirit and each contribute, then I believe that this year we will be able to make great progress in establishing the conditions on which political trust and commercial prosperity depend, etc."</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Flandin made a speech on peace in response, saying that the French and British governments have established a spiritual unity, and the two countries are now making a solemn appeal for the peace of mankind. The first goal of the two countries is to stop destruction and assassination. All those who have participated in the Great War now believe that to seek the beauty of the future lies in promoting humanitarianism. Flandin concluded by saying that all those who fly across the English Channel see that France and Britain are covered by the same sky, and the two countries now do not allow this sky to be a carrier of death, etc. (Reuters Telegram on the 9th)</p>
<h3>France is Eager to Promote the Eastern European Pact</h3>
<p>Plans to Continue Negotiations with Russia and the Little Entente</p>
<p>Britain's Attitude is Obviously Cold</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the foreign correspondent of the Woovert Report, the issue discussed by Laval and Simon after their dinner yesterday was how to implement the points in the Anglo-French declaration. The correspondent continued that Prime Minister Flandin opposed convening a four-nation, five-nation, or six-nation conference to resolve these issues, but advocated exchanging views through ordinary diplomatic means or directly convening a disarmament conference. The newspaper also said that if Germany refuses to participate in the Eastern European Pact, then this issue will inevitably become the main topic. However, although Flandin is now eager to discuss this issue with Soviet Russia, Simon's attitude towards this issue after the Anglo-French London talks is obviously cold. The Echo newspaper also confirmed this point, saying that the French government is now continuing negotiations with Soviet Russia and the Little Entente to promote the implementation of the Eastern European Pact. At the same time, Soviet Russia and the Little Entente are also urging France to fulfill the agreements of December 5 last year and January 18 this year to ensure that the success of Eastern Europe comes earlier than other pacts. The newspaper also said that although France is willing to conduct detailed consultations with other countries, it will not sacrifice its military and political actions during the consultation period.

<h3>Simon Returns to England from France</h3>
<p>The Trip to Berlin is Denied by Officials</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Minister Simon, who came here yesterday to attend the annual banquet of the British Chamber of Commerce in Paris, returned to London by plane with his wife today. (Havas Telegram on the 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Whether Foreign Minister Simon will make a trip to Berlin has been rumored since the end of the London talks between Britain and France. The German newspapers also seem happy to echo this statement. According to the "Observer" diplomatic correspondent, the Foreign Minister's trip to Berlin is bound to become a reality. The newspaper said, "Although official circles have adopted a reserved attitude towards this matter in accordance with convention, they have now refused to deny it, which is particularly noteworthy. After the declaration of the two countries, Britain and France, was sent to the German government, British Ambassador Sir Phipps submitted a report to his government, saying that the German attitude was quite supportive.</p>
<p>That the German government is still in the stage of considering how to consult with other countries regarding the Anglo-French proposal on the basis of equality is not only a matter of course, but it is still difficult to judge whether it is better to convene a general meeting or to engage in consultations through diplomatic channels. In short, it is still in the preparatory stage. Once the reaction of the governments of various countries to the London Declaration is clear, a better method can be decided.

<h3>Germany Carefully Drafts a Reply to the British and French Proposals</h3>
<p>It is Said that the Attitude is Still Good</p>
<p>(Berlin) Before the London Declaration of Britain and France was announced, the ambassadors of each country to Germany notified the German government of its contents. The German government's reply will be prepared by Thursday or Friday and handed over to the ambassadors to Paris and London, respectively, for delivery to Britain and France. The outline has now been drafted. This can be seen from the fact that the activities of the German government have come to a standstill. It is heard that Hitler's throat disease has worsened due to overwork and he has gone to Berchtesgaden to rest. Even Deputy Foreign Minister Luff has left the capital for winter sports, and the responsibility for organizing the reply has been delegated to the relevant officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to our agency, the wording of the reply is friendly and the content is positive. Germany accepts the various proposals made by Britain and France as a basis for free consultation between all parties on an equal footing, and especially emphasizes the level of equal qualifications. Germany may not discuss the proposals made by Britain and France at length in the reply, or point out the points of most concern to the country, namely the arms limitation convention. As for the Sky Pact plan, Germany believes that it is a concrete expression of the right to equal arms and strongly agrees with it. In addition, Germany will pay attention to the demands of the two countries for an explanation on the draft Danube Pact (that is, the Central European Non-Interference in Internal Affairs Pact). Regarding the draft Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, it still opposes signing this pact with the Soviet Union. One reason is that Germany and Russia do not have adjacent borders, and the other is that the Soviet Union spans Europe and Asia. If this pact is established, Germany is afraid that it will be involved and take action in places where its interests are not threatened. This position has a considerable relationship with Germany's policy towards Poland and its friendship with Japan. German newspapers have recently attacked Soviet Russia again, and there seem to be clues to be found. In short, if the above-mentioned draft conventions are to become a reality, it is inevitable to convene an international conference. Before the convening, it is necessary to hold long-term negotiations on diplomatic channels to prepare everything. This is what is expected. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>The Siamese Government Decides to Close Chinese Schools</h3>
<p>Suffering Unequal Treatment</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Schools are Jointly Protesting</p>
<p>China United News Agency Bangkok Correspondence: The Siamese Ministry of Education, on the grounds of implementing the ten-year education plan stipulated by the constitution, notified all Chinese schools on the 19th of this month that the mandatory classes should be suspended from April 1. (According to the regulations, Siam has implemented compulsory education in districts for more than ten years, and overseas Chinese have also followed suit. It is stipulated that a certain area is a compulsory education area, and all children aged seven to fourteen should attend classes in compulsory schools.) The authorities of various Chinese schools were shocked and panicked when they received this sudden notice. However, at first, they thought that all foreign schools in Siam were treated in this way. Later, the Ministry of Education's secretary issued a statement, knowing that the Ministry of Education's cancellation of the strong recent classes in various schools this time was</p>
<p>Specially applied to Chinese schools, they added a doubt to their shock and fear. On the 18th of this month, the Minister of Education summoned representatives from various Chinese schools to talk and answered the questions raised by the representatives, also saying this. Therefore, the doubts of the authorities of the Chinese schools became even more solidified. They believed that this move by the Ministry of Education was somewhat unfair. At present, various Chinese schools have unanimously submitted letters to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Education, requesting the revocation of the order and allowing various Chinese schools to continue to operate compulsory classes as before. It is found that fourteen schools, including Huanghun, Guangzhao, and Xinmin, have submitted letters and are currently negotiating and protesting.</p>
<h3>The Puppet State Controls the Coal Industry</h3>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Set up a Committee to Handle</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Coal Industry Control Committee, which decided on the outline for controlling the coal industry, later discussed the implementation methods with the Kwantung Army, the South Manchuria Railway, and the "Manchukuo" and other related agencies. Now, the details have been completed and agreed upon, and the first committee will be held at the end of this month. The agreement was originally based on the treaty between Japan and "Manchukuo". With the mediation of the Kwantung Army, the committee was not completely established in accordance with the treaty. The members were recommended by one person each from the Kwantung Army Staff Officer Mr. Nishimura, the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Industry, and the South Manchuria Railway Coal Mine Company. Another secretary system was established, with one person each selected from the Kwantung Army, the Ministry of Industry, and the South Manchuria Railway to handle the matter. The control plan is now being submitted for registration. After the establishment of the association, there will be reasonable progress in the development of coal mines.

<h3>The Iraqi-Iranian Boundary Dispute is Resolved</h3>
<p>Italy and Iraq Sign a Treaty of Friendship</p>
<p>Rome - Iraqi Foreign Minister Sate came here the other day to discuss with Iranian (that is, Dothian) Foreign Minister Ghasemi the resolution of the boundary dispute between the two countries. At the same time, he negotiated a treaty of friendship with Italy. The treaty of friendship between Iraq and Italy has now been signed and completed. Mr. Sate is scheduled to return home tomorrow. He recently gave an interview to a reporter from the "Italian Daily", saying that he had reached an agreement with Iranian Foreign Minister Ghasemi. The relationship between the two countries is friendly and seamless. Regarding the border dispute, Iraq's claim is based on the Ouzelon Treaty (signed by the Turkish Empire and Persia) and various subsequent agreements. This treaty stipulates that the left bank of the Shatt al-Arab River (that is, the entire river belongs to Iraq) is the boundary between the two countries. The river is Iraq's only outlet to the sea, and Iran has a coastline of 2,000 kilometers. Iraq will never hinder Iran's right to free navigation on the river, but Iraq's sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab River is determined by the treaty and cannot be sacrificed, etc. (Havas Telegram on the 9th)</p>
<h3>The Political Situation in the South is Chaotic</h3>
<p>The National Assembly is About to be Re-elected</p>
<p>Outskirts of the Yugoslav Capital - The Yugoslav National Assembly has been dissolved and is now preparing for re-election. The political situation is very chaotic. According to the regulations, the largest political party in Yugoslavia is the National Party. Until the recent establishment of the cabinet in the district of Yeofu, the party has always controlled the political life of Yugoslavia. In this election, in addition to the party, whether the right-wing anti-government parties of the Serbian and Croatian tribes will unite with Dr. Marticek, the former leader of the Croatian Peasants' Party, to put forward a joint list of candidates is a question. In addition, it is not known whether some new political groups will be formed. For example, the leader of the previously dissolved Socialist Party, Dobrovic, is now planning to reorganize a new party. Also, a certain newspaper in Zagreb said that only those who advocate coordination between the parties can make the country consolidate and unite. It is generally believed that Prime Minister Yeofu will not ignore this view. (Havas Telegram on the 10th)</p>
<h3>Confrontation Between Hardline and Moderate Factions Within Japan's Seiyukai Party</h3>
<p>Inconsistent Attitudes Toward the Government</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the Seiyukai's internal and external general affairs committees convened at the Shiba San'entei. Hardliners such as Ando, Yamaguchi, and Kawakami vigorously argued that the government's mere increase of 15 million yen in reserve funds, failing to accommodate the party's demands, demonstrated a lack of sincerity. They asserted that, to uphold the party's reputation, the Seiyukai should adopt a resolute stance, rejecting the budget and confronting the government. This viewpoint emphasized a firm approach. Conversely, the self-respecting faction, led by Maeda and Shimada, advocated for separate handling of the no-confidence motion and the budget, seeking the budget's passage and cautioning against rash actions. The purist faction dismissed compromise, advocating for a clear declaration of opposition and a thorough, unreserved scrutiny of the government's policies. As the three factions failed to reach a consensus, they decided to await the prevailing trend before making a final decision. The meeting adjourned at 8 PM. (10th Electric Communication)</p>

<h3>US Gold Clause Case Verdict Announcement Postponed</h3>
<p>Potentially Unfavorable to the Government</p>
<p>President Prepared</p>
<p>(Washington) After five hours of deliberation this afternoon, the nine Supreme Court justices directed the court clerk to issue a statement: "I am instructed to announce that the verdict on the gold clause will not be delivered on February 11th." Well-informed sources suggest the delay stems from disagreements among the justices. However, the verdict could be delivered any day after the 11th of next week, as the court will be in session daily until Monday, the 18th, after which it will recess for two weeks. Therefore, the verdict must be delivered by the 18th at the latest. It is believed that the court, mindful of the unstable financial situation, will strive to announce the verdict by the 18th. During the justices' deliberations today, government officials also held a series of secret meetings, the longest being a conversation between President Roosevelt and Attorney General Cummings. According to responsible sources, the two have agreed on procedures to follow should the verdict be unfavorable to the government. Meanwhile, supporters of the government have been slightly comforted, as the prominent New York brokerage firm Daniel &amp; Co. is now offering odds of three to one that the verdict will favor the government. An employee of the firm told a Reuters reporter, "This is a common-sense bet because no one wants to bankrupt the government." Senator Thomas shares this view. Speaking to guests in New York today, he said he expects the Supreme Court to uphold the government's gold clause and that inflation is likely inevitable, possibly through the reminting of currency with silver. Thomas also addressed the government's banking bill at a certain location, stating that efforts to pass the bill through Congress would spark a debate unparalleled in recent generations. He believes a regulated dollar will ultimately emerge, and regardless, he wants to see a dollar that is plentiful and cheap, easily accessible to the people, especially debtors. At the same time, he wants to protect the people through investment. (9th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Lindbergh Kidnapping Case Trial Continues</h3>
<p>No New Facts Discovered</p>
<p>Arguments Begin Today</p>
<p>Flemington: The Hauptmann case is now continuing in court here. Today's hearing did not uncover any new facts. It is rumored that the defendant's lawyer, arguing that the evidence of the crime is incomplete, is requesting an acquittal. Should the court grant this request, the jury would immediately express its opinion. However, the judge ultimately refused. The prosecution will now read the indictment on Monday, followed by arguments. A verdict may be delivered on Tuesday evening. The defendant's lawyer is attempting to attribute the kidnapping crime to a certain Stantler. Stantler appeared in court today to defend himself, saying that the ransom for the kidnapping was paid in the Bronx Cemetery, but he has always been terrified of cemeteries. If he had received the ransom, he would have been scared to death wandering in the graves. Furthermore, he is penniless and still dressed in rags. If he had been involved in the kidnapping, he would not be in such a state. (9th Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany Scientifically Constructing Automobile Highways</h3>
<p>Planning to Build 6,000 Kilometers First</p>
<p>German Dispatch: The German government will use 50 million gold marks for the construction of special automobile highways over the next ten years. This type of highway construction was invented by Germany in the world. Its primary purpose is to "use money on the road," making durability the prerequisite for the roads built. Highway construction research is attracting general attention, so it has become a specialized science in national socialist countries. This highway construction work is by no means as simple as leveling the ground, covering it with gravel, and compacting it with a steamroller. The essential elements should be meticulously surveyed by road construction experts to determine the extent to which the highway can withstand the burden of automobile traffic. Only when this is understood can the materials for road construction be selected. The various processes depend on heavy scientific work. In particular, the reaction force of automobiles and heavy vehicles eroding the road surface during highway travel is considerable, and the vehicles themselves also suffer damage. Therefore, road construction experts must use German instruments to survey the extent of road surface damage and the funds required for new designs and repairs, and a meticulous budget must be prepared in advance. Following this is the measurement of the pressure of automobiles traveling on the road, as road surface damage is generally caused by this pressure. Furthermore, the vibration force must also be determined using earthquake testing instruments. As for which road surface is suitable for road surface wear and travel speed, detailed calculations must be made. However, what is still lacking is a practical research subject, namely, "a test highway," because only with this can various tests be carried out to determine the life and construction form of the road. To meet this need, the Road Construction Research Institute of the Saar-Lauterburg University of Technology in Germany is using a section of an old factory site as a "test highway" for various tests. Ordinary roads are not very suitable as test roads, because it is impossible to verify the firmness of the plane of an ordinary road surface until the road has been used for ten years. Therefore, the establishment of a test road is the only way. The construction of this road surface is the same as that of an ordinary road. The test method is to use various wheeled freight vehicles carrying hundreds of thousands of tons of heavy loads, driving continuously on it. Four months of testing can be equivalent to ten years of use of an ordinary road. After four months of use, all the shortcomings can be identified and modifications can be started to ensure that the road surface can be used for more than ten years. Only after various specialized inspections can the following accurate judgments be made: 1) What speed is suitable for various forms of highways? 2) The braking force of car brakes on various highway road surfaces. 3) The impact of various climates on the road surface. 4) The impact of automobile traffic vibrations on nearby buildings. 5) Which automobile tires are the most suitable? In short, all inspections are closely related to vehicles, tools, and roads, that is, detailed judgments are made on traffic safety, traffic economics planning, road life, and road form. At present, Germany has first stipulated that the highways to be built are 6,000 kilometers, some of which have already started construction, and others are being prepared for construction.

The exposition will be held simultaneously in Tokyo and Yokohama for a total of 170 days, from March 15 to August 31 of Showa 15. The total area of the venue is 2.3 million tsubo, and the investment is estimated at 20 million yen. There are 24 exhibition halls, such as the Founding Memorial Hall. A total of 53 countries will participate in the foreign special exhibition hall, and each country will send its national treasures for display, gathering the world's cultures in one place. It can be said to be an epoch-making exposition in the Showa era. (10th Japan United Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Napoleon's Love Letters to Be Publicly Exhibited by the French Government</h3>
<p>(Paris) Three hundred and eighteen love letters from Napoleon I to his empress Marie Louise were recently purchased by the French government from the London auction market for a large sum of money. They will soon be publicly exhibited in the National Library. A part of these letters were written before Napoleon's marriage, and a part were written during the Russian campaign and in France. The last letter was sent by Napoleon when he was first defeated and exiled to Elba. One sentence in the letter reads, "You and my son (that is, the King of Rome in swaddling clothes), I hope to see you again one day." The words are sincere and moving. (9th Havas)</p>

<h3>Li Zhonggong Appointed to Enter Guizhou</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Zhonggong, who was appointed to enter Guizhou, spoke of bandits in Guizhou who once disrupted Zunyi and other places. After the central army and the Guizhou army jointly suppressed them, they have been wiped out. The power in the area bordering Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan is also very weak and will not be difficult to eliminate immediately. Commander Chiang appointed him because he is a Guizhou native and understands the situation in Guizhou. He especially ordered him to return to Guizhou to assist the military and political parties in handling all the aftermath. Although Guizhou is extremely poor, the burden of military and political expenses is not very heavy. The entire province has only more than 20,000 troops. In terms of political expenses, the salaries are even lower than in other provinces, so reorganization is not difficult. The urgent task in the future is to develop and build. In recent years, transportation in Guizhou has been developed and convenient to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The Sichuan-Guizhou highway has not yet reached Chongqing, and the Hunan-Guizhou highway will also start construction soon. When it is completed in the future, it will be more convenient to connect with the interior. In addition, the China Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-Guizhou aviation is also being planned and will be realized soon. It is planned to go to Lushan in two or three days to meet Commander Chiang, ask for instructions, and then go to Hankou, transfer to Sichuan, and then go to Guizhou by land. According to reports, the road along the Sichuan-Guizhou highway is very peaceful, with no need to worry about unexpected events, and this opportunity can be used to investigate the suffering of the people in the interior as a reference for assisting in handling the aftermath. As for how long to assist in Guizhou, it is not yet possible to determine. He has already requested a three-month leave of absence from his duties in the Legislative Yuan. If he cannot return to Beijing at that time, he will apply for an extension of his leave. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Longxi: To All Newspapers,</p>
<p>In previous years, our army was ordered to suppress bandits in Jiangxi. Later, due to the sudden Min Rebellion, the army was divided and sent east. Fortunately, thanks to the virtues of the Central Government and the planning of Chairman Chiang, the rebels were eliminated in less than a month. Then, the army was moved again to encircle and suppress, and the bandit dens were destroyed. Our soldiers traveled through dangerous and diseased areas, and went in and out of the hail of bullets. Although the victory was won, countless bones have been dried. Now that the Red bandits have fled far away, the people's difficulties have been slightly relieved, all due to the loyal and brave soldiers who sacrificed their lives to serve the country. Alas, the blood of Chang Hong has not yet dried, and the grave of Xian Zhen awaits return. National mourning is the same, and heroic spirits should be recruited. It is scheduled to hold a memorial meeting at the Zhangzhou military camp on March 15. I dare to ask the leaders of the party and the country, the scholars in the country, and the comrades to send eulogies and elegies to commemorate the heroes and comfort the loyal souls.

<h3>Intensifying Military Tensions Between Japan and Russia</h3>
<p>Both Sides Secretly Increase Troops at the Border</p>
<p>Seven Russian Employees of Muling Coal Mine Arrested</p>
<p>With Japan and Russia engaged in illegal trading of the Eastern Railway, both sides have intensified their alert, secretly dispatching agents and mobilizing troops. The Japanese army even arrested several Russian employees of the Muling Coal Mine, accusing them of being Soviet spies with political missions. Details of each situation are described below:</p>
<p>Hailar Report: The Japanese cavalry brigade stationed in Hailar has recently, under the guise of rigorous military exercises, secretly dispatched troops to move towards Manchuria. It is said that the Soviet Union has increased its Red Army by 15,000 troops from Irkutsk to Da Wu Li, equipping key locations. The Japanese and puppet propaganda and negotiations with Tokyo on the Eastern Railway are not unrelated. In addition, after the Soviet international train departs from Manchuria, passengers are prohibited from looking outside the train. The Soviet Union must have secret military activities. Therefore, the Japanese cavalry brigade stationed in Hailar began this secret movement after receiving reports from intelligence officers.</p>

<p>Harbin Report: The Japanese Special Service Agency, together with the Harbin Special District Police Department, recently surrounded the branch of the Muling Coal Mine Company on Ashi River Street in Nangang, arresting the Russian flower shop manager Buchkov, and a Chinese clerk, Mr. Qi. At the same time, they dispatched police to search their residences, obtaining various documents. They also arrested seven Muling Coal Mine employees at other locations: Isfusky, Heimovsky, Baumikaliyev, Yebishamo, Shiweinov, Manakovsky, and Laburikhin. All seven were detained in the Special Service Agency for secret interrogation. After repeated investigations, it was revealed that these arrested individuals were all "Gobi U" sent by the Soviet Union, serving as secret Soviet intelligence agencies. They were also in contact with Soviet agencies in Poli, Suifenhe, Manchuria, Shuangchengbao, Vladivostok, and Yima. The events they specialized in spying on include: 1) Japanese and puppet military actions, facilities, deployments, and strength in northern Manchuria; 2) Japanese and puppet situation regarding negotiations on the China Eastern Railway; 3) Planned, under construction, and completed railways, highways, air routes, waterways, and electrical communications in the puppet state. They all used their service in the Muling Coal Mine as cover, loudly singing the praises of Japanese "Manchu" Russian friendship, and interacting with Japanese military and economic agencies, such as the Special Service Agency, the South Manchuria Railway, the Naval Department stationed in Manchuria, and other large Japanese business groups. They also colluded with Japanese officials in the puppet state to obtain information, and transmitted the information they obtained to the aforementioned locations via Soviet consulates as mailboxes. Recently, they had close interactions with European and American figures, and used large sums of money to buy over Chinese people to serve as members of commando groups, organizing cell groups, which revealed their activities and were detected and arrested by the Japanese Special Service Agency. The Soviet consul has now lodged a protest. (Tohoku News Agency)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Returns to Chongqing from Luzhou</h3>
<p>Main Bandit Force Attacks Xuyong, Nearly One Thousand Killed</p>
<p>Numerous Machine Guns and Rifles Captured, Countless Prisoners Taken</p>
<p>Beijing Report: Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, telegraphed his representative in Beijing, Qiu Bingyi, on the 8th, detailing the battle situation on the South Bank. The original text is as follows: "Confidential. I, Xiang, returned to Chongqing from Luzhou yesterday. The situation at the front of the bandit suppression in the South Route is as follows: 1) After Zhu De and Mao Zedong were defeated by us at Tucheng, the bandits suffered a confirmed loss of over 30,000 people. Those who escaped in small groups number no more than 10,000. They attacked Xuyong on the fifth, which was the main force of the bandits, numbering about five or six thousand. The fighting was quite fierce, as they intended to seize counties such as Xuyong and Xingchang, and then flee across the Hengjiang and Jinsha Rivers via the main road. Our troops surrounding Xuyong, led by myself, along with local militias, resisted for two days, and the bandits did not succeed. As the bandits attacked and climbed the city walls, they were killed by our hand grenades and machine guns, numbering as many as eight or nine hundred. Later, with the arrival of pursuing troops, they were forced to flee in a panic towards the narrow Jin'ezhi Daba area. Other scattered bandit groups fled in disarray towards the border between Sichuan and Yunnan. 2) Scattered small groups hiding in the mountains of southern Sichuan, numbering from dozens to over a hundred, are being surrounded and intercepted by our large teams and are being wiped out separately. Our encircling troops, clearing troops, and pursuing troops have all been deployed and are determined to wipe them out completely, leaving the bandits no chance of escape. 3) During my detailed telephone inquiries with various divisions and brigades in Luzhou about the battle situation, I learned that the corpses of the bandits killed in this battle were scattered across dozens of miles. Countless prisoners were taken, but because the various units were in transit, the prisoners could not be transported and were scattered in villages and fortresses, where they were often killed by the local militias, as the people had suffered greatly from their ravages, expressing their resentment, which the government troops could not stop. 4) Many guns and cannons were seized from the bandits, especially rifles, but because the various units were eager to pursue and suppress, they were unable to report clearly. Therefore, the detailed numbers are still pending investigation. Special note." Liu Xiang's official seal. (Shen Shi News Agency)</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes International Telecommunications Convention</h3>
<p>| Report of the Foreign Affairs Committee's Review |</p>
<p>Beijing Report: At the fourth meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 8th, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Yuan reported on the review of the draft International Telecommunications Convention, deciding to pass it according to the review report. The original text of the Foreign Affairs Committee's review report is as follows: "Submitting a report. The case was ordered by the President on October 30 of the 23rd year, Secret Order No. 674, to comply with the order. The case was approved by the Executive Yuan, Consultation No. 180, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications jointly reported that the International Telegraph Conference and the International Wireless Telegraph Conference held in Madrid, the capital of Spain, in the 21st year of the Republic of China, the National Government specially appointed Wang Linge, the Chargé d'Affaires stationed in Spain, as the plenipotentiary representative of our country. The conference opened on September 3 and closed on December 9. The documents agreed upon include the following: 1) International Telecommunications Convention 2) Telegraph Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention and its Final Protocol, 3) General Regulations for Wireless Telegraphy attached to the International Telecommunications Convention and its Final Protocol, 4) Additional Regulations for Wireless Telegraphy attached to the International Telecommunications Convention, 5) Additional Protocol to the International Wireless Telegraph Conference, 6) Telephone Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention. Among the above documents, except for the Additional Protocol and Telephone Regulations listed in items 5 and 6, which are local agreements of the European system and are not related to our country, the rest have been signed by our country's representatives. However, Article 6 of the International Telecommunications Convention states that 'This Convention shall be ratified by the governments of the signatory countries. These instruments of ratification shall be deposited through diplomatic channels, as soon as possible, in the archives of the Government of the country in which the Plenipotentiary Conference which drew up this Convention was held. The latter Government shall notify all the signatory or acceding Governments of each deposit of ratification.' Article 7 also states that 'Each Government shall declare its approval of the Regulations drawn up by the Conference as soon as possible. This approval shall be notified to the Bureau of the Union, which shall inform the other members of the Union.' Since February of this year, the Spanish Minister to China has successively notified the ratification of the above Convention and the approval of its attached Regulations by many countries. The various documents agreed upon at the Madrid Conference have been translated into Chinese by the Ministry of Communications. These documents are all aimed at promoting international telecommunications cooperation and convenience, and are formulated under the principle of respecting the sovereignty of various countries. After checking the content, there is nothing inappropriate. Among them, the International Telecommunications Convention and its attached Telegraph Regulations, General Regulations for Wireless Telegraphy, and Additional Regulations for Wireless Telegraphy have been signed by our country's representatives and should be ratified and approved separately in accordance with the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention to complete the procedures. The International Telecommunications Convention is to be transferred to the Legislative Yuan for review and then submitted to the National Government for approval. As for its attached Telegraph Regulations, etc., they are all about technical and operational methods of telecommunications and are attached documents to the International Telecommunications Convention. It seems that these Regulations can only be sent to the Legislative Yuan for reference when reviewing the Convention. After the Convention is ratified, the Ministry of Communications plans to notify the International Telecommunications Union Office to declare its approval in accordance with the regulations. Is it appropriate? The original documents in English and French, as well as Chinese translations, are attached in five copies for your review and instructions." Accordingly, this matter was brought up at the 175th meeting of the Yuan, and it was resolved that "Passed." In addition to the instructions, the original attached documents are enclosed in two copies each and sent to your Yuan for review. This order includes the International Telecommunications Convention, the Telegraph Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention, the Wireless Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention, the Telephone Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention (English and French versions and Chinese translations, two copies each, to be returned after use). In compliance with this, this matter was brought up for discussion at the first meeting of the fourth session of this Committee on January 21st of this year, and it was resolved that "Committee members Tao Luxian and Xia Jinlin will jointly conduct a preliminary review." Subsequently, the two committee members, Tao and Xia, reported that "The case of ratifying the International Telecommunications Convention was previously resolved at the first meeting of the fourth session of this Committee and assigned to Luxian and others for a joint preliminary review. The preliminary review meeting was held on the 25th of this month, with representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications attending to provide explanations. The results of the discussion are as follows: 1) This Convention is a merger of the St. Petersburg Telegraph Convention of 1875 and the Washington Wireless Telegraph Convention of 1927. Our country has acceded to or ratified both conventions separately. Although this Convention has slight additions and supplements, such as the added clauses in Articles 1, 8, and 21, and the supplementary clauses in Articles 11, 12, and 19, they are all factually necessary. The content of the Convention is generally appropriate, and as of recently, 29 countries have ratified this Convention, and 4 countries have declared their accession to this Convention. Our country seems to be able to ratify it. 2) Among the contracting countries of this Convention, the Kwantung Leased Territory is also included. This is similar to the Washington Wireless Telegraph Convention. When our country ratified the Washington Wireless Telegraph Convention, it had an accompanying declaration. Therefore, when ratifying this Convention, we can follow the previous example and add an accompanying declaration as follows: 'The National Government of the Republic of China, when ratifying this Convention and approving the attached regulations, formally declares that the National Government of the Republic of China does not recognize or concede the right of any foreign country or its people to install or use wired and wireless equipment in leased territories, settlements, concessions, embassy areas, railway areas, and other similar areas without the explicit permission of the National Government. Any mention of these leased territories in this Convention and the attached regulations, whether explicit or implicit, shall not affect Chinese sovereignty.' Are the above resolutions appropriate? Attached are a list of ratification dates of this Convention by various countries and a comparison table of the old and new Convention clauses, one copy each." This matter was brought up for discussion at the second meeting of the fourth session of this Committee on January 30th, and it was resolved that "1) The Convention shall be approved in accordance with the preliminary review report. 2) The accompanying declaration for the ratification of this Convention shall be approved in accordance with the preliminary review report." Are all the circumstances of this Committee's review and approval of the International Telecommunications Convention appropriate? A document is prepared, together with a list of ratification dates of this Convention by various countries and a comparison table of the old and new Convention clauses, one copy each, for your review. Respectfully submitted to the President Sun and Vice President Shao. Enclosed are a list of ratification dates of the 1932 Madrid International Telecommunications Convention by various countries, a comparison table of the old and new Convention clauses, one copy each, and the International Telecommunications Convention, the Telegraph Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention, the Telephone Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention, and the Wireless Telegraph Regulations attached to the International Telecommunications Convention, in English and French, with Chinese translations, two copies each.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Permits Opium Addicts to Surrender Themselves</h3>
<p>Before the Implementation of the Regulations for Prohibiting Opium and Punishing Offenders</p>
<p>Surrender Themselves to the Local Opium Prohibition Committee and Request Treatment</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Report: The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Regulations for Prohibiting Opium and Punishing Offenders, which were approved and promulgated by the Nanchang Headquarters, impose heavier penalties on opium offenders than the Opium Prohibition Law. The intention of this legislation is to eliminate opium addiction in reality. However, many opium addicts in this province are used to their habits and have missed the opportunity to register, making it impossible to extricate themselves. If strict penalties are imposed on all of them, it is a pity. In order to show leniency in sentencing and provide opium offenders with the opportunity to repent and start anew, the provincial government has specially formulated the Jiangsu Province Opium Offenders Surrender Regulations, which will be promulgated and implemented. It is hereby urgently announced for the information of all sectors of the province. This permission to surrender is the last opportunity for opium offenders to start anew. All those who are addicted to opium and have not registered should immediately realize their mistakes and surrender to the local county Opium Prohibition Committee before the Jiangsu Province Provisional Regulations for Prohibiting Opium and Punishing Offenders are implemented and await treatment. If they continue to hesitate, once discovered or reported with evidence, they will be severely punished according to the law and will not be lenient. The Opium Offenders Surrender Regulations and a comparison table of penalties under the Opium Prohibition Regulations and the Opium Prohibition Law are recorded below.</p>
<p>Article 1. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially formulated these regulations in order to encourage opium addicts who have not registered to repent and start anew. Article 2. Before the implementation of the Jiangsu Province Opium Prohibition and Punishment Regulations, opium addicts in this province who have not registered may surrender themselves in accordance with these regulations. The surrender referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be made to the county Opium Prohibition Committee under its jurisdiction. Article 3. Opium offenders who surrender themselves must fill out a surrender form stating their name, place of origin, age, gender, address, and the form of the surrender form will be determined separately. Article 4. Opium offenders who surrender themselves in accordance with the law may be handed over to the opium abstinence center by the county opium prohibition committee under its jurisdiction for treatment, and may be leniently exempted from penalties. Article 5. When opium offenders who surrender themselves are handed over to the opium abstinence center for treatment, they shall pay fees such as food and medicine in accordance with the fee regulations of the opium abstinence center, but those who are indeed impoverished may be given appropriate reductions or exemptions. Article 6. Opium offenders who surrender themselves shall be given a certificate of abstinence after being treated and withdrawn from addiction by the opium abstinence center, and shall be released back to the county opium prohibition committee after being released on bail. The certificate of abstinence referred to in the preceding paragraph shall be affixed with a two-inch photograph of the opium offender who surrendered himself, and the photography fee shall be borne by him. Article 7. Opium offenders who are reported and then surrender themselves shall not be allowed to invoke the surrender regulations. Article 8. In counties with too many opium offenders who surrender themselves, where the opium abstinence center cannot accommodate them, temporary reception centers may be set up, and the required funds shall be subsidized by the provincial opium prohibition committee. Article 9. Matters not covered by these regulations may be revised by the provincial government. Article 10. These regulations shall be promulgated and implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Comparison table of penalties under the Jiangsu Province Provisional Regulations for Prohibiting Opium and Punishing Offenders and the Opium Prohibition Law (hereinafter: 1) Offense, 2) Opium Prohibition Law, 3) Opium Prohibition and Punishment Regulations): 1) Manufacturing or transporting opium, 2) Imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years, and may be fined not more than 5,000 yuan, 3) Death penalty or life imprisonment; 1) Planting opium poppies, 2) Imprisonment for not more than five years, and may be fined not more than 3,000 yuan, 3) Death penalty or life imprisonment; 1) Transporting opium poppy seeds, 2) Imprisonment for not more than three years, and may be fined not more than 1,000 yuan, 3) Death penalty or life imprisonment; 1) Selling opium, 2) Imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years, and may be fined not more than 5,000 yuan, 3) Death penalty, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for not less than ten years; 1) Setting up a place for people to smoke opium, 2) Imprisonment for not more than five years, and may be fined not more than 1,000 yuan, 3) Life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than seven years; 1) Smoking opium, 2) Imprisonment for not more than one year, and may be fined not more than 1,000 yuan, and addicts shall be ordered to quit opium, 3) Imprisonment for not more than five years, and addicts shall be handed over to a doctor for forced abstinence; 1) Resuming smoking after abstinence, 2) No provision, 3) Imprisonment for not less than five years. (Note) After the province formulated limited-time opium prohibition measures, opium cases in the past were handled and convicted by organs with military law authority based on the Opium Prohibition Law and ordinary criminal law. Now that the Jiangsu Province Provisional Regulations for Prohibiting Opium and Punishing Offenders have been promulgated, these regulations will be uniformly implemented fifteen days after each prefecture reports the promulgation. From then on, opium cases will be handled and convicted by organs with military law authority in accordance with these regulations.</p>
<h3>General Account of Zhenjiang's Commerce after Closing Accounts</h3>
<p>The Grain and Money Industries Profited the Most</p>
<p>Followed by the Northern Goods, Oil, and Restaurant Industries</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: Although Zhenjiang's commerce last year suffered from the lingering effects of social and economic decline and lacked prosperity, the market situation over the past year was still able to trend towards stability. Only a few small shops went bankrupt. The results of the final settlement of accounts were generally good. Most of the silver money industry and various retail stores reopened for business as usual on the 8th. The findings of the investigation are described as follows:</p>
<p>Silver Money Industry: Banks rose in prominence as the money houses declined. Currently, there are seven banks: Central, China, Communications, Farmers, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and China Industrial. Except for the Central Bank, most have expanded their business, also engaging in credit lending. Last year, the Shanghai Bank had the most developed business, followed by China Communications Industrial. However, the profits were not significant. As for money houses, there are only five: Daoshengyuan, Kangdingchang, Shengji, and Chengyu. They could not freely engage in credit lending, and their exchange business was seized by banks. Therefore, those with more capital engaged in side businesses. For example, Daoshengyuan, Kangdingchang, and Chengyu engaged in securities trading or transported miscellaneous grains and northern goods, earning profits ranging from twenty to thirty thousand taels of silver, in addition to subsidizing expenses. Shengji and Chengyu did not have such additional income, resulting in losses to cover expenses. Chengyu has already ceased operations, while the other four reopened on the 8th.</p>
<p>Grain Industry: Last year, grain prices gradually increased due to a poor harvest of new grain. Rice prices rose from five or six yuan to over ten yuan. Rice mills seized this opportunity, profiting many times over. Furthermore, with frequent purchases by Zhejiang and Fujian sailboats, the business of grain merchants flourished even more. In total, there were dozens of grain merchants and mills. Except for Yisheng, which incurred losses due to dumping wheat and went bankrupt before the Mid-Autumn Festival, none suffered losses. Mills such as Fufeng, Dayou, Yuantai, and Feng had profits exceeding ten thousand taels of silver. Because various merchants and mills were discussing industry regulations, none opened for business on the 8th.</p>
<p>Northern Goods Industry: The large merchants in the northern goods industry only include Yuansheng, Dongqin, Yihang, and Hengliang. The three main firms, Taishun, Taifeng, and Helongda, mainly traded in northern goods such as daylily buds and peanuts. In the late autumn and early winter of last year, the market price of daylily buds rose sharply, and the market for peanut kernels was also good. Those with inventory could profit. Yuansheng, Dongqin, Yihang, and Hengliang had abundant capital and transported goods themselves, resulting in substantial profits. Taishun also had some profit, while Taifeng and Helongda only managed to cover expenses. After the settlement of accounts, Helongda decided to cease operations due to the death of the shop owner, and Taifeng and Helong will also make changes. The remaining few shops have no changes and will reopen as usual within days. As for the dozen or so small merchants along the old canal, their situation was also relatively stable.</p>
<p>Silk Fabric Industry: The silk fabric industry was affected by the exhibition twice last year and also restrained by domestic goods companies. Business was unusually sluggish, with most suffering losses. Among the silk merchants, Dacheng and Daxin suffered more losses due to being newly established. Yukang and Xiangtaicheng were average. Yucheng was able to profit solely because it had good opportunities to purchase goods, making its business relatively developed. As for fabric stores, only Fuhua, Xianghengyuan, and Chang had wholesale transactions that could supplement income and barely cover expenses. Other retail stores did not fare well. All silk fabric stores will open after the 10th of this month, but a few will undergo internal reorganization or make slight changes.</p>
<p>Oil and Sundries: The business opportunities for Hongjiang oil in the Jiangguang industry last year were not as good as in 1933. The final results for peeled white oil were fair. Soy sauce shops all reported fair results, with a few having thick profits due to the sudden rise in soybean oil and raw oil prices at the end of the year, as well as those with inventory, such as Dehexiang and Qingshengchang. The sugar and sundries shops generally reported fair results. Although Gantaixiang and Xincheng went bankrupt at the end of the year, it was said that they were burdened by overdue accounts from customers. All other shops reopened as usual on the 8th.</p>
<p>Timber Yards: In recent years, the timber industry has shown signs of decline, mostly affected by falling prices. The situation for the yards was not good in the first half of last year. After autumn, the timber price gradually rose due to the sharp reduction in supply from the upper reaches of the river. Those with larger inventories greatly benefited. The yards and sheds had more profit, and the merchants also had some surplus.</p>
<p>Other Industries: The wine and sauce industry suffered from competition from refined salt and Yangzhou pickles, and business was not very good. Except for the wine shops, others could not cover expenses. For Jingguang goods, Yilongxiang was the best, while others suffered losses. All restaurants were not bad. Wanhua and Zhonghua had the most profit. The silver jewelry industry also did not fare well because the gold market was ordinary last year. Although the small steamer industry rotated shifts, competition was not as fierce as in previous years. However, too many steamers of each company were idle, and interest burdens were heavy. Only a few shifts per month were allocated, which was not enough to cover expenses, so all suffered losses. (9th)</p>
<h3>Decline of Fuyang's Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Disaster-stricken Farmland Accounts for 70 Percent</p>
<p>The Paper and Lime Industries Are Also Sluggish</p>
<p>Fuyang Correspondence: Fuyang is located in the lower reaches of the Qiantang River, adjacent to Hangzhou in the north, and is an important route in Zhejiang Province. The people are diligent in farming, and paper production is the main industry, so the livelihoods of farmers are quite prosperous. However, in recent years, due to frequent floods and droughts, and the decline of the paper industry, the rural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition, last year's drought was particularly severe, with disaster-stricken farmland reaching more than 186,300 mu, accounting for 70 percent of the total amount in the county. The paper industry has further declined. Other secondary industries such as lime and umbrella frames have also been significantly affected. Agricultural products such as yellow sprouts and cabbage cost only one copper coin per catty, and firewood costs five copper coins per catty. The plight of farmers can be seen in general. The details of each situation are listed below:</p>
<p>Disaster Situation: Due to the terrain of this county, the Fuchun River enters from Tongzhou and extends to Changlingtou for ninety li. Whenever there is continuous rain, the river overflows and stagnates, failing to flow smoothly, so farmland is often flooded and becomes a swamp. In the event of a drought, the streams dry up, and the disaster is immediately visible. Water conservancy projects are limited by funding, and plans remain unrealized. Last year, disaster-stricken farmland accounted for 70 percent of the total amount in the county. A total of 122 townships in the county reported disasters, divided into three categories: 90 percent disaster, 70 percent disaster, and 50 percent disaster. For 90 percent disasters, all taxes are waived; for 70 percent disasters, 50 percent of taxes are waived; and for 50 percent disasters, 20 percent of taxes are waived. ⑴ For disasters of 50 percent or more, there are 2,565 mu of taxable farmland, 2,037 mu of taxable land, 1,126 mu of government-owned land, and 176 mu of sandy land. ⑵ For disasters of 70 percent or more, there are 26,034 mu of taxable farmland, 15,848 mu of taxable land, 3,860 mu of government-owned land, and 509 mu of sandy land. ⑶ For disasters of 90 percent or more, there are 110,176 mu of taxable farmland, 21,996 mu of taxable land, 7,186 mu of government-owned land, and 4,849 mu of sandy land. In total, there are 186,360 mu, with an original amount of 266,041 mu (excluding original wasteland). Disaster-stricken farmland accounts for 70 percent.</p>
<p>Industry: The most famous industry in this county is papermaking, with an annual output value of about 8 million yuan. Among them, straw paper is the most abundant, with an annual output of 4 million pieces, followed by yellow-white paper and yellow-burning paper, and skin paper is the least. Paper mills account for 27 percent of the province, making it the place with the most paper production in Zhejiang. Last year, due to the impact of the drought, all competed to make paper to make up for the losses. However, the rice straw produced in this county was insufficient, so they went to neighboring counties to purchase it, resulting in soaring raw material prices, but the selling price was lower than before. Due to the large amount of goods, the merchants could not fully absorb them, and there was often infighting, which further reduced the paper price. The intrusion of foreign goods caused the sales of white paper such as Yuanshu and Changshan to stagnate. Yellow-burning paper is used for underworld purposes, but in recent years, superstitious customs have been abandoned, and sales have become sluggish. Those engaged in yellow-white paper are all professionals, with more capital than straw paper, but the selling price has plummeted, and the cost is not enough. After the end of the year, it is said that one-third of the mills will stop production. In the first ten days of this month, it rained continuously, and straw paper could not be dried and was even rotten. Fortunately, the weather cleared in the middle of the month, and the paper tubes that had been stacked for ten days (that is, the squeezed wet paper) could be dried and sold, so many paper sellers came to the city in recent days. The paper merchants took advantage of the fact that the lunar year was approaching and the mill owners were in urgent need of money, so they were able to greatly reduce their prices. The secondary industry in this county is lime, with an annual output of 217,940 dan, which are transported and sold to Ningbo, Shaoxing and other places, and are necessary for weeding fields and making paper. The best products are from Qingyun Bridge. In 1932, one yuan could buy 90 to 100 catties, but this year one yuan can buy 125 catties. Business is only three-tenths of what it was in previous years. There are also lime kilns in Shanglishan and other places in Jiangnan, and the products are slightly inferior to those of Qingyun Bridge. In 1932, one yuan could buy 95 to 100 catties, but this year one yuan can buy 150 to 160 catties. Next is umbrella frames, which are produced in Jilong Mountain, with an annual output of 400,000. The paper umbrellas produced in Hangzhou are all made from materials from this county. Recently, due to the decline in general prices, this year's prices are about 30% lower than in previous years, and sales are also much worse than before.</p>

<h3>Jail Warden Dismissed by Order of the Court</h3>
<p>Wu Daoyuan, the jail warden of this county's prison, was recently reported to the county court prosecutor's office by Jiang Faming, a former guard who had been dismissed, stating that Yang Yuexing, a prisoner who had committed a crime against his family in Longhua, had bribed the jail warden and guards with money to be able to go home for the New Year, colluding in fraud, etc. The prosecutor ordered Yang Yuexing and others to be brought to court for questioning, and Jiang was released on bail. Prosecutor Liu summoned jail warden Wu Daoyuan for questioning yesterday and ordered him to await further investigation. Unexpectedly, jail warden Wu received an order from the High Court to dismiss Wu Daoyuan, the jail warden of Songjiang County, for incompetence and appointed Li Shuzhang as his successor.</p>

<h3>Kidnapper of Apprentice Arrested</h3>
<p>Xingxuan, the fifteen-year-old son of Wang Gengquan of Yujiazhai in the fifth district of the county, was an apprentice at the Futai cigarette and paper shop at 228 Avenue Joffre in Shanghai. On the afternoon of February 3, he was ordered by his master to go to the Xiaocai Market at the Eight Immortals Bridge to buy things. He happened to meet a fellow villager, Wei Amao, who told him that his father was seriously ill and asked him to go back with him. Xingxuan replied that he would explain to his master when he returned to the shop. Amao refused, saying that the last Shangnan bus was about to leave and there was no need to inform the shop. So they took a tram to Dongjiadu, transferred to a ferry to Zhoujiadu, and took the Shangnan bus to Zhoupu. After sitting in the Fuyuan Teahouse for a while, another person (Wang Mingsheng) came and walked to Shenzhuang together. Xingxuan wanted to part ways and go home, but Wei Amao threatened him with a sharp knife and took him to Wei's house, where it was already dark. Amao forced him to sleep and forbade him to make a sound. Seeing that the defense was slightly lax, he took the opportunity to escape and returned to tell his father, who reported to the Zhaolouzhen Merchant Corps overnight, and they went to arrest Wei Amao and Wang Mingsheng. According to Wang Mingsheng's confession, Amao had also committed many theft cases, and the Merchant Corps had handed him over to the Zhoupu Public Security Bureau for transfer to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Drug Pill Offender Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>On September 11th of last year, the First Public Security Bureau in the city uncovered a den for people to smoke drug pills behind the Yousi Alley house on Dashiqiao, arresting the principal offender You Panfa, the suspect Chen Wangshi, and three smokers, including Ji Abu. They also seized three pill guns, three pill lamps, forty-eight drug pills, and pill ash cigarettes. They were immediately handed over to the county government. After questioning, Chen Wangshi and Ji Abu were released on bail and ordered to quit drugs, while You Panfa was sent to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command for interrogation. Now, after the military law office of the command determined the facts, considering that he had difficulty making a living and was worthy of sympathy, he was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. The sentence has been approved by the Nanchang Camp and returned to the county government of this city for execution.</p>
<h3>Celery Boat Robbed Midway</h3>
<p>In the area of Wu Hongzhang, Wu Gezhong, and Wu Zhonghe in the Lufang Village of Wujiagang, north of Yuqizhen in the ninth district of the county, the three families not only cultivated rice and wheat but also grew celery as a sideline. At 4 p.m. on the 9th, they hired a boat full of celery to sell in the city. When passing by the Gaoxiao Railway at about 10 p.m., more than a dozen bandits dressed in black, tattered military uniforms suddenly jumped out of the bank and shouted to stop the boat, firing shots as a warning, causing a hole to be shot in the left side of the bow. Seeing this, Wu and others had to dock the boat. The bandits, speaking with a northern accent, boarded the boat and claimed to be inspecting for contraband. They dragged Wu and the other two to a nearby thatched shed, tied them with ropes, and searched them all over. Anyone who resisted was beaten severely. Wu Hongzhang was the most seriously injured. As a result, the original nineteen yuan in banknotes and two dimes were searched for twelve yuan. Yesterday (the 10th) morning, Wu and others drove the boat to the city, sold the celery in the boat to Xingmao, a local goods store under Huinong Bridge, and planned to report to the Public Security Bureau to request an arrest.</p>

<h3>Century-Old Shops Also Close Down</h3>
<p>After the closing of accounts in this county, it is customary to open the market on the fifth day of the lunar new year. However, since all industries have been affected by the decline of the rural economy, only Yilong and Yongyi money houses have maintained their operations. Since then, various shops have lost their lifeline, and many have closed down. Dahuajin, the largest silk fabric store, also decided to close down due to lack of capital. Other century-old shops such as Jin Songmao Clothing Store, Tailai Paint, Hardware, and Sundries Shop, and Luhezai Shoe Store all have a considerable history, but unexpectedly they also closed down in this recession year, which is a pity. In addition, there are many other shops that have closed down or shrunk.</p>
<h3>Head of the Agricultural Education Center Disappears</h3>
<p>Qian Xijin, the current head of the Heyang Agricultural Education Center, is from Taixing. He came to Changshu to work two years ago and used up all the accumulated funds of more than 800 yuan from his predecessor. Later, he was transferred to the Taihe Agricultural Education Center, but after being inspected by Cao Shutian, the education office's supervisor, he was rated as a "D" and reassigned to his current position. Recently, due to a meeting to hand over accounting matters from his predecessor, the above-mentioned deficit was discovered, and he suddenly disappeared. The staff of the center have now requested instructions from the education bureau on how to deal with the matter.</p>

<h3>Progress of the Liuyang Road Project</h3>
<p>Since the relocation of the Liuyang Highway Project Office to Liuhe, it has actively urged the completion of the entire road project in order to open it to traffic as soon as possible. It has recently been learned that the roadbed of the road is being organized in sections and is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, and it can be opened to traffic next month. The canal movable bridge is under construction, and the Chuh River movable bridge is being test-piled. The project is huge and will take several months to complete. Therefore, the traffic will only start from the west bank of the canal and end at the east bank of the Chuh River, with a road length of about 60 kilometers. As for the bridge and culvert project of the Liuchu branch line, it may be completed by the end of this month, and the roadbed is being built, but it still needs to be completed.</p>

<h3>Each Steamer Reinstates Towing Vessels on Long Routes</h3>
<p>Before the lunar new year, the various small steamer companies in Yangzhou, due to the reduction of passengers, specially agreed to release the long-distance small steamers to Qingzhen, Zhentai, and Gaoyou on their own starting on the 30th of last month, without towing vessels. Now that the lunar new year has passed, the companies have continued to discuss restoring the original state and have decided to attach towing vessels as usual on the (7th) today to facilitate merchants.</p>
<h3>Financial Situation after the Closing of Accounts</h3>
<p>The decline of Yangzhou's commerce has been a long time, but the continuation of business still depends on the profits and losses after the closing of accounts at the end of the lunar new year. Some news of the financial industry has been released this year: ⑴ Chengyu Money Shop at Yuanmen Bridge closed on the eve of the lunar new year and decided to close down. ⑵ Qingyu Money Shop on Yusi Street did not make any profits or losses after the year-end financial settlement, but it felt that the market was depressed and decided to close down voluntarily. ⑶ It is said that Huiyu Money Shop on Zuowei Street is unsure whether it will open for business or not. The opening date of the other shops will be decided after the Qianye Gongyi (Money Industry Association) decides on the 8th.</p>

<h3>Inspector Causes Accident While Driving</h3>
<p>Wang Changmao, an inspector of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Bureau, was driving a certain passenger car on a trial run in the Pingza section on the 4th. When he arrived near Hongniyan, he happened to meet Chairman Huang Shaoxiong's car. He turned the wheel to make way urgently, but he did not prevent Lu Hezhen, a girl from Xiaoshi, from walking on the left side of the road. She was knocked down and crushed to death on the spot. Knowing that the accident had been caused, the inspector tried to escape by driving fast, but he was stopped by the guard in the chairman's car, who drew his gun and shouted. He then telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to send police to detain Wang Changmao and send him to the county for questioning. The deceased originally lived in Li Guanqiao, Xiaoshi. Last year, she was separated from her parents while fleeing the famine and was stranded in Pingdi. She was planning to walk back to her hometown along the road, but unexpectedly she died before leaving the county. She has now been placed in a coffin to await collection.</p>

A total of 4,438 households in 43 townships and towns were counted. Relief tickets with the Shenshan A-grade code were issued as proof. It was decided that all relief would be distributed in the three districts of Bencheng, Linpu, and Xiaosanzhen, starting on the 10th of this month. The heads of the various townships and towns were notified to lead the disaster victims to prepare the designated places to receive the relief rice.

Recently, the transmission of diphtheria and measles has been very severe. In Xiaocheng, there have been 40 families in which children have died from this disease, and the number of deaths is about 40, especially among children aged five or six.</p>

<h3>Signing of the Shanghai Chinese Telephone Long-Distance Connection Contract</h3>
<p>Increasing Trunk Lines, Canceling Deposits</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the connection between the Chinese area and the concessions of Shanghai for long-distance calls began in the 14th year of the Republic of China. Article 22 of the Chinese-Foreign Call Contract signed by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company stated that if the Telephone Bureau wanted to connect the company's users to long-distance lines in other cities, a separate contract should be signed. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau, therefore, negotiated a long-distance telephone contract with the Telephone Company in May of the 15th year of the Republic of China. Regarding charging methods, it was stipulated that company users using long-distance telephones, whether calling out or calling in, the company could charge an additional five cents for each call in addition to the call fee stipulated by the Ministry of Communications. This contract expired in May of the 21st year. The Ministry of Communications immediately sent personnel to negotiate with the Telephone Company to renew the contract. However, the original Chinese-Foreign Call Contract on which the contract was based had expired in December of the 19th year, and a renewal contract had not yet been signed. The long-distance telephone connection contract could not be resolved in advance, and the case was delayed. It was not until April of the 22nd year, when the temporary Chinese-Foreign telephone contract was officially signed, that the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to continue negotiations with the Telephone Company. It was proposed that because long-distance calls in the concessions had to be transferred through two manual stations, the procedures were cumbersome and the efficiency was reduced. It was suggested that the trunk station in the concessions be canceled, and that the trunk lines of the Telephone Bureau's Zhabei long-distance station be directly connected to the company's automatic exchange. However, the company side repeatedly delayed, and no results were achieved for a long time. It was found that the concessions accounted for 80-90% of the long-distance telephone calls between Shanghai and other places. The eight pairs of trunk lines between the Chinese area and the concessions had long been insufficient. Moreover, since the opening of the three new trunk lines between Beijing and Shanghai and the two Shanghai-Hangzhou long-distance lines recovered by the Ministry of Communications, the call volume has become even more congested. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau has repeatedly requested the Telephone Company to increase the trunk lines, but the Telephone Company refused to do so because a new contract had not been signed. The reason why the new contract was so difficult to produce was that the opinions of the two sides differed on the method of dividing the call fees. The Ministry of Communications wanted to maintain the original plan, with the company sharing five cents for each incoming and outgoing call. The company's opinion was that, according to the total amount of call fees, 15% should be shared for outgoing calls and 5% for incoming calls. After much negotiation, the two sides finally compromised, and on the 7th of this month, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Telephone Company formally signed a new contract. According to the provisions of the new contract, regarding equipment, both parties should establish and maintain appropriate operating procedures to ensure that users on both sides have rapid and direct calls. Regarding call fees, they should be charged according to the prices stipulated by the Ministry of Communications. Except for the collection of appropriate special labor costs for sending special messengers, neither party may collect other fees. Regarding the call fees shared by the company, outgoing calls will receive 10%, with a minimum of five cents and a maximum of one dollar and fifty cents. Incoming calls will receive 5%, with the same minimum and maximum amounts as outgoing calls. In addition, it is also stipulated that without the written permission of the other party, one party cannot transfer or assign this contract or any rights in the contract. It is now heard that in order to facilitate telephone calls for citizens, the Ministry of Communications intends to increase the number of trunk lines to facilitate call traffic, and also intends to cancel the method of pre-paying long-distance telephone deposits. All Beijing-Shanghai telephone users only need to declare to the local telephone agency that they are responsible for paying the call fees, and they can connect to long-distance telephones at any time. This measure will be implemented soon, benefiting the citizens in no small way.</p>
<p>According to the Industrial Society, the number of overseas Chinese who have been expelled from Japan and returned to China has reached 32 batches, totaling more than 300 people. In addition to some who returned to their original homes, there are still dozens of people stranded in Shanghai, waiting to go to Kenmu after the completion of Qiaole Village. It is now known that the houses in Qiaole Village have been completed. Those who have completed the registration procedures and have been approved can go there immediately. After hearing the news, overseas Chinese in this port have filed applications for registration with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. It is reported that the first batch of six people has been approved. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Approval from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission: The six overseas Chinese, Chen Weilin, Pan Yongfeng, Chen Xiangeng, Zhan Yanlin, Zhou Jiayuan, and Yao Sanhui, etc., received a letter No. 2 from the Nanjing Relief Committee for Unemployed Overseas Chinese yesterday, stating that the submitted application forms, etc., have been reviewed. Except for Yao Sanhui, who did not attach foreign travel documents, the other five people are in compliance with the recruitment guidelines for reclamation farmers. However, Yao Sanhui stated that his foreign travel documents were confiscated by the police in his place of residence. However, after checking the report No. 27 of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau on expelled refugees, it was confirmed that he was indeed the person. All should be approved. It is ordered that the returned overseas Chinese arrive at the Wanan Hotel on Wanan Street in Wuhu on February 15, where staff from Qiaole Village will receive them and lead them to Shuiyang Town to go to the overseas Chinese village for reclamation. A village entry permit, a schematic diagram of the transportation route from Shanghai to Qiaole Village, and a schedule of fares are issued. They should immediately hold the certificate and bring their own luggage, take a boat from Shanghai to the Wanan Hotel in Wuhu, and wait for instructions. After entering the village, a land reclamation license will be issued. Attached to this approval are a village entry permit and a schedule of fares.</p>
<p>Another Batch Arrives: According to overseas Chinese Tian Zuolan, who spoke to reporters yesterday, another five overseas Chinese who were expelled from Japan, Wu Shizhong, Zhao Yuming, Pan Zhongyu, Lou Jifa, and Xie Wenhui, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese postal ship Tatsuta Maru a few days ago. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau has already distributed temporary relief funds of five yuan per person, and it is said that in April and May, a large number of overseas Chinese will be expelled and returned to China.</p>
<p>Xu Jizhuang's Talk: The Industrial Society reporter met Xu Jizhuang at the overseas Chinese residence yesterday. Xu Jizhuang said that the overseas Chinese who were expelled from Japan and returned to China have arrived in Shanghai in 32 batches, totaling more than 300 people. Most of them are from Yongjia, Ruian, Qingtian, Zhejiang. I (Xu referred to himself) left more than a dozen homeless overseas Chinese in my home due to hometown connections, vacated a room, and allocated it as a dormitory. It was found that Chen Xiangeng and Hu Wenhan, who were expelled in the first batch, and Zhan Yanlin, who was expelled in the 29th batch, were not allowed to be reclaimed by the "labor-capital cooperation" stipulated by Qiaole Village because they had married Japanese women. The outline of Qiaole Village, which is run by the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, stipulates three methods of "self-funded", "loan-funded", and "labor-capital cooperation reclamation". Except for the ninth article of the outline, which stipulates that "reclamation farmers are allowed to carry luggage, but not family members, except for those who can afford to pay for their own expenses, build their own houses, and support their families". After I explained to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission the reasons why Japanese women could not stay in Shanghai, the chairman of the commission, Chen Shuren, approved it yesterday. However, the travel expenses for refugees to enter the village have not yet been settled, and I am trying my best to raise funds, and I hope that people from all walks of life will do their best to help so that it can be done.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bank Agricultural Conference Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Speeches by Zou Bingwen, Yang J眉mei, etc.</p>
<p>Dr. Stephen to Speak Today</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Bank Agricultural Department's business meeting held its opening ceremony at 4 pm yesterday on the sixth floor of the bank. More than 50 agricultural personnel and branch managers from Nanjing, Hankou, Jinan, Bengbu, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places attended. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Zou Bingwen reported on the purpose of the meeting, the main points of which were: 1. The bank has been handling agricultural loans for two years. The colleagues in the Agricultural Department deeply feel that this matter is of great importance and that their strength is insufficient. Therefore, they are taking this opportunity to invite experts Stephen and Stran to give lectures to increase their knowledge of cooperation. 2. The agricultural personnel have insufficient knowledge of banking business, so they also invited the responsible personnel of various departments of the bank to give lectures on banking business at the same time. 3. To determine this year's loan plan, on the one hand, to ensure that the loans are safe, and on the other hand, to ensure that the loans are beneficial to farmers, so that they can be discussed in detail. He also asked the branch managers and the responsible personnel of the bank to give more guidance. Then, Mr. Yang J眉mei delivered a speech, hoping that agricultural workers in various places would pay attention to two points: 1. The organization of cooperatives must be sound; 2. The instructors should fully assist the progress of rural undertakings so that farmers can benefit, and the loans can be recovered safely. Subsequently, Yang Dunfu, Li Tongcun, Wu Kejia, Zhao Hansheng, Cai Moping, Zhou Cangbai, Lu Jungu, and others also gave speeches. Finally, Chairman Zou Bingwen invited branch managers, important officials of the head office, and agricultural workers from various places to have dinner. Zou declared that he would invite everyone to eat cabbage and tofu. Each table of food would only cost three yuan. Rural issues were discussed during the dinner, and the meeting dispersed at about 6 o'clock. It is reported that Dr. Stephen will be invited to speak on various theories related to cooperatives at 9 am today.</p>
<h3>Nisshin Kisen Company Ships on the Yangtze River Route Stop Service in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Say There are Two Reasons</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Daily News on the 10th, due to the decline of the economic community, the shipping industry has also declined. Among the world's trading ports, the number of empty ships berthed in Shanghai has gradually increased in recent years. Among them, the ships of the Nisshin Kisen Company, which operate on the Yangtze River, account for the majority. Opposite the international dock in the Huangpu River, there are eight empty ships berthed: Ruiyang Maru, Yueyang Maru, Daji Maru, Dazhen Maru, Yiyang Maru, Changyang Maru, Yunyang Maru, Yulin Maru, etc. Except for a few ships that are being repaired as usual, most of them are unable to load goods due to the impact of the anti-Japanese sentiment since the Shanghai Incident.</p>

<h3>The Bean and Rice Industry Resolved to Reject Near and Far-Term Checks</h3>

It was decided that the north and south cities would uniformly open the measures on the 10th. All checks, whether near or far-term, would not be accepted. If they are secretly accepted, they will be dealt with publicly after verification. The north and south cities will check each other and must not conceal and not report.

<p>United Federation of Roads Held Meeting Yesterday</p>

The reasons for their opposition were briefly stated as follows: The Shanghai Telephone Company has already obtained considerable profits in its business last year. Even if the price is not increased in the future, it will not be in deficit. Moreover, at this time of economic panic in Shanghai, the business of Japanese merchants is not profitable, so how can they afford the high telephone rates? It is heard that this resolution has been submitted to the relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Chongming Shanghai Association Initiates the Establishment of the Chongqi Joint Governance Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Tong Xingbai and Others Elected as Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>First Standing Committee Meeting to be Held Today</p>
<p>According to Shanghai News, the Chongqi Joint Governance Promotion Committee, initiated by the Chongming Shanghai Association, held its inaugural meeting at He'an Primary School at 2 pm yesterday. The attending committee members were Tong Xingbai, Lu Caifu, Gong Jianqiu, Qu Runchu, Huang Bojun, Yang Zhenzhong, Shi Chongpeng, Lu Yinchu, Wang Leming, Chen Dongbai, Song An, Yan Yazou, Huang Bowen, Yan Yunlin, Gong Pixiong, Lu Yanghao, Cai Zizhuo, Yang Songyu, Lu Xizhen, Wu Tiren, Xu Peihang, etc. The presidium was Lu Caifu, Qu Runchu, Gong Jianqiu, and the recorder was Chen Dongbai.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: ㈠ Amendment of the committee's simple rules, resolved and passed; ㈡ Election of positions, resolved and elected Tong Xingbai, Cao Yinqiu, Lu Caifu, Qu Runchu, Gong Jianqiu, Lu Yanghao, Lu Yinchu, Shi Fuju, Yang Zhenzhong, and other nine people as standing committee members, and the personnel of each group will be determined by the standing committee; ㈢ Deadline for compiling a research report on Chongqi joint governance for reference, resolved and handed over to the standing committee to collect materials and research reports within a deadline; ㈣ Telegraph the government to merge Chongqi as soon as possible to benefit the people, resolved and passed, and Mr. Wu Caichen was elected to draft; ㈤ Election of representatives for petition, resolved and to be elected at an appropriate time; ㈥ Adoption of declaration, resolved, amended and passed; ㈦ Scheduling of standing committee meetings, resolved and scheduled for 2 pm on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Declaration: The declaration of the Chongqi Joint Governance Promotion Association is as follows: The Republic of China was founded, changing autocracy to republic. The Provisional Constitution clearly states that sovereignty rests with the people, so as to show impartiality. Under the rule of the National Government, provinces and counties are divided into two levels, and local autonomy is based on counties. As far as Chongming is concerned, the original inner and outer sand were combined into one unit. In February of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the provincial government forcibly divided the inner and outer sand into Qidong County, without investigation or preparation, increasing taxes and burdens, and dividing property to incite disputes. For seven years, officials and people have been in distress. Local gentry and people have called for correction, exhausting their efforts and voices, but have not stopped. The initiation of the Chongqi Joint Governance Promotion Association by our colleagues in the Shanghai Association is a legitimate and just act, and we should have a firm determination. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government handed it over to the Civil, Financial, and Construction Departments for review. When the reports were submitted, they all advocated joint governance. Unexpectedly, when the Provincial Government proposed a meeting, it suddenly added the eight characters "the case has been determined, it is not convenient to change," and then said that the Civil, Financial, and Construction Departments would convene the county magistrates of the two counties to discuss and resolve the difficulties between the two counties. The difficulties arise from separation, and instead of resolving them through joint governance, they are entrusted to the three departments and two counties to convene and discuss. It was not implemented, but was delayed and stalled, which is too ridiculous. Subsequently, Mr. Wang Qingmu presented a petition to the Executive Yuan to correct the Provincial Government's stubborn views. President Jiang also ordered the Secretariat to send a letter to the Ministry of Interior for verification, stating that if the division was not appropriate, the case should be corrected even if it had been determined. The meanings of changing and correcting are very different. Dividing one unit into two units, changing is against the will of the people, which is one mistake. The former provincial government did not correct it in the 20th year and said that it was not convenient to change, which is the second mistake. The association believes that the petition for joint governance is to correct the previous mistakes and cannot recognize the word "change." Yesterday's newspaper reported that Jiangsu Province is starting to reform county administration, ordering the county magistrates of each county to prepare a written opinion on the reform and submit it within a deadline. According to this, it is a general statement of county administration in Jiangsu Province. If our current situation in Chongming, the unit is not perfect, broken and fragmented, how can we start? Therefore, the petition for joint governance is even more urgent. Joint governance must be resolved as soon as possible, and then the improvement of county administration can be on track. The colleagues of the association care about their hometown and should cherish their position as masters, be responsible, and strive for it. Chongming is almost there.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Construction Meeting</h3>

The Beiche township road should be jointly convened by the second and third districts to gather the relevant township heads for discussion, set a deadline to compile a list of conscripted workers, and report to the county for scheduled construction. The Qian San township road should be personally supervised by the second district chief to compile a list of conscripted workers and start construction quickly; ㈢ The fifth district will be urged by the county government to quickly prepare for the dredging of various rivers; ㈣ Committee member Peng Yingqiao proposed to request the withdrawal of funds for telephone service in the Puxi area to install telephones in various townships, and the matter will be discussed and proceeded with later; ㈤ Wu Shifang, director of the Yingdou River Dredging Project Office, requested the allocation of funds to repair the bridges on the river in two stages, and should prepare a detailed project plan and budget to be submitted to the county for forwarding to the Construction Department to subsidize one-quarter of the project costs.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Railways Instructs Both Railway Bureaus to Strictly Prohibit Driver Negligence</h3>
<p>Recent Incidents on Both Railways</p>
<p>Found to be Caused by Driver Negligence</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus recently received instructions from the Ministry of Railways stating that incidents on the railways were caused by two reasons: first, the operating regulations have not been strictly followed; second, the punishment for drivers who cause accidents is too light to serve as a warning. The Ministry ordered that responsible personnel in the mechanical department be instructed to strictly comply with the regulations and not to act in a perfunctory manner. If the cause of any accident is indeed due to driver negligence, severe punishment should be imposed to deter negligence and reduce incidents. After receiving the order, the Railway Bureau instructed the mechanical department to notify all drivers to strictly comply.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Congee Kitchen Continues to Open This Morning</h3>
<p>No Need to Expand Kitchen Site</p>
<p>Funding Now Secured</p>
<p>To Close at the Beginning of Next Month</p>
<p>The Zhabei Congee Kitchen, which was closed on the 26th of last month, has been closed for two weeks. It was originally scheduled to open yesterday, but due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed until last night to start cooking congee, and continues to distribute it from 7:00 AM this morning. According to Mr. Wang Binyan, Director of the Zhabei Charitable Joint Association, after the kitchen was forced to close due to the large number of congee recipients, in fact, the relief work for the poor has not been slackened or neglected in the slightest, and copper coins and rice tickets have been distributed from time to time for relief. On the 30th day of the lunar calendar, the poor could obtain hundreds of copper coins by begging from households in the streets, and were reluctant to receive the few copper coins issued by the association. Therefore, rice tickets were distributed twice that evening, and more than 4,000 poor people came to receive them, consuming about 200 dan of rice. These days are the period for receiving rice with tickets, so the work of the Charitable Joint Association is extremely busy. Considering the hardship of the people, the congee kitchen has decided to open tomorrow morning (the 11th). I will go to supervise and inspect at 3:00 AM tonight. Fortunately, the weather has gradually warmed up recently, and most young and strong men will be able to find work opportunities and support themselves. The number of congee recipients will be less than before, so there is no need to expand the kitchen site. As for the funding, it has now been secured through my efforts and can continue to be maintained. The congee kitchen will be closed at the end of this month and officially closed at the beginning of next month. With the warm spring sunshine, the poor can find ways to make a living on their own. Those vagrants who are lazy and unwilling to work are not those we can help or are willing to help.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Close Winter Shelter Due to Spring Cold</h3>
<p>Extended Closure Due to Insufficient Funds</p>
<p>Red Cross Donates 50 Bags of Rice</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Charitable Organizations yesterday received a report from Zhang Zixin, Director of the South Shanghai Winter Shelter, stating that since the shelter opened on December 1st of last year, it has been more than two months, and the number of people received has been increasing daily. There are now more than 2,900 people in the two shelters, and the expenses have reached more than 18,000 yuan, with food being the most important. Currently, about 25 shi of rice are still needed daily, and the spring cold is particularly severe, making it difficult for the poor to leave the shelter and support themselves. If the closure is extended for one month, 9,000 yuan will be needed. The current balance is only 1,000 yuan, which is insufficient for use and falls far short. Please provide relief quickly to benefit the poor. The chairman has been running around raising funds for days, and the Red Cross has donated 50 bags of rice. The association has prepared a letter to withdraw and use them.</p>
<h3>Silk and Biscuit Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Due to Increased Costs</p>
<p>Prohibition of Price Cuts Among Competitors</p>
<p>At the beginning of the New Year, various industries in this city have been planning to increase prices to recover their losses due to the sharp drop in prices last year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shengjing Silk: The Shanghai Silk Industry Association's Shengjing Silk Notice states that due to the soaring price of silk and increased costs, the silk group has decided that the price of each product this spring will be temporarily increased by two cents of silver based on last year's winter price to maintain profits. All transaction payments for customers must be fully cleared by the end of each month to facilitate turnover.</p>
<p>Mercerizing Factory: The Mercerizing Factory Group of the Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association announced that the prices of raw materials used by various factories in the industry have not fallen in recent years, and expenses have been increasing daily. Although efforts have been made to economize, it is difficult to maintain, and there is a precarious situation. In order to strive for survival and avoid overall bankruptcy, it has been decided by the group's factories to increase the price by 5% this year compared to last year. It is hoped that customers will understand and appreciate this.</p>
<p>Biscuit Industry: The Shanghai Confectionery, Biscuit, and Canned Food Industry Association's Biscuit Price Increase Announcement states that the prices of various main raw materials used in our biscuit industry have been rising sharply in recent years, while the selling price has been declining rapidly. Not only is there no profit to be made, but even capital is being lost. We cannot expand our business to seek small profits and quick turnover, nor can we abandon eating due to choking, and change our course. Therefore, we have no choice but to collectively decide to increase the original selling price appropriately to inject capital. If esteemed customers provide patronage, please understand the situation and support our success. We are grateful for this. If any of our competitors privately reduce prices and undermine the resolution, we will severely punish them without leniency once verified. Please abide by this. This is a special announcement.</p>

<h3>Grain Merchant Dies in Storm</h3>
<p>Tao Jisheng and Four Others Missing</p>
<p>Tao Jisheng, a grain merchant from Jiangbei, used to collect and sell miscellaneous grains in the Jiangbei production area and transport them to Shanghai for sale. In mid-December of last year, he purchased 850 bags of wheat from Jiangbei and loaded them onto the Ding Sanhe ship for sale in Shanghai. However, due to the lunar New Year holiday, it was not easy to sell them at once. Tao mortgaged the goods with a certain firm for 2,000 yuan to repay the unpaid amount for the goods in the production area. He took the money and returned to Jiangbei on the Ding Sanhe ship, instructing Ding to speed up the journey so that he could arrive in Jiangbei before the lunar New Year. The Ding ship sailed to Sanjia Water, Chongming East Shoal, at dawn on New Year's Eve, and capsized due to the impact of wind and waves. All the people on board fell into the water. A tugboat passed by and rescued seven people, carrying them to Chongming to go ashore. Tao, Ding Sanhe, and four crew members are still missing. Yesterday, the rescued crew members came to Shanghai to report to a certain firm, which telegraphed Tao's family in Jiangbei.</p>

<h3>Juxing Rice Shop Robbery Cracked, Thanks to the Director</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd of this month, at around 8:00 AM, when the Juxing Rice Shop, located at No. 50 Dingfu Lane, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, was opening for business, three robbers armed with weapons broke in and robbed cash, banknotes, gold jewelry, silk clothing, and leather clothes, worth more than 1,000 yuan. Subsequently, the patrol police arrested two robbers and seized a pistol and the stolen clothing and jewelry, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that the Juxing Rice Shop is opened by Shen Rongtang, a local. On that day, the robbers took the clothing, banknotes, and silver, packed them into a bag, and the two robbers carried the stolen goods north. When passing the entrance of the Dongjiadu Police Station, the gate guard caught a glimpse of them and suspected that they were suspicious, so he reported to the Director Yi Zuanren. At that time, the shop owner also ran to the police station to report the robbery. Director Yi immediately led Inspector Guo and the patrolling officers to search in all directions.

<h3>Hotel Waiter Shoots Mistress</h3>
<p>Han Jinmei, a 26-year-old woman from Changzhou, currently resides at No. 54 Zhangjia Lane in the city. When she was registered, she was married to a Mr. Yu through a matchmaker. Because she was not accustomed to rural life and loved modernity, she came to Shanghai to find work with her fellow villagers. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shanghai, she was seduced by Lu Yongsheng (29 years old), a Suzhou native who was a waiter at the Shenzhou Hotel. Lu raped her, and they rented a house and lived together. Although Lu Yongsheng was a waiter, his income was still abundant, so they have been living together like husband and wife for six years. Recently, Lu Yongsheng lost his job, and life was difficult. Jinmei also wanted to find another man. Yongsheng saw through her intentions, but he could only endure it due to economic pressure. However, Jinmei had already taken a liking to someone else, so she quarreled with Yongsheng all day long, asking for household expenses and money for Mahjong. Yongsheng could not raise the money, which made him angry. He was also forced by Jinmei's words. At 10:30 PM the night before last, she asked for money to go out and gamble, which made Yongsheng extremely angry. He grabbed a kitchen knife and slashed Jinmei's head, causing her to bleed all over and fall to the ground. The neighbors called the police officer Tian Yushan, who took the criminal Lu Yongsheng and the injured person to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After Director Liu found that the injuries were serious, he sent her to the Red Cross for treatment and interrogated her about the case, and sent it to the Bureau of Justice for handling.</p>

<h3>Zhang Hongliang, Suffering from Cerebral Nerve Disease, Drowns Himself</h3>
<p>Became Ill and厭世 Due to Excessive Study at the Agricultural College</p>
<p>Committed Suicide After Arriving at Wusongkou on the Hongxing Ship</p>
<p>Several Letters Left Behind, Words Were Weighty, Tragic, and Heartbreaking</p>
<p>Zhang Hongliang, the young master of Zhang Linji Perfume Shop, located at No. 15 Dingning Lane, Allegre Road, French Concession, committed suicide by drowning himself after suffering from cerebral nerve disease for a long time. On the fifth day of the lunar New Year, he took the Hongxing ship to Ningbo alone. When the ship arrived outside Wusongkou, he suddenly jumped into the sea. Several letters were found, addressed to his father, fiancée, classmates, and shop staff. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Father Became Wealthy: Zhang Linsheng, the owner of Zhang Linji Perfume Shop, located at No. 15 Dingning Lane, Allegre Road, French Concession, is a native of Yin County, Zhejiang Province. He is 61 years old and was the General Manager of the Dalu Pharmacy. He became wealthy by inventing Elegant Cream. In addition to operating perfume and various cosmetics, Zhang also established a canned food factory in Ningbo, producing products such as oil bamboo shoots and dried vegetables, which were popular on the market for a while.</p>
<p>Zhang Hongliang, who Drowned Himself</p>
<p>Became Ill from Studying Hard: Zhang has four sons and one daughter, all unmarried. The eldest son, named Hongliang, was born to Zhang's first wife. He is 28 years old. He first studied at Shanghai University and transferred to the Agricultural College of Nanjing University three years ago. He excelled in both academics and conduct. Unfortunately, he suddenly suffered from cerebral nerve disease seven or eight years ago due to excessive study. Although he was repeatedly diagnosed and treated by doctors, it recurred and never fully recovered. He had no choice but to leave school last summer and travel to Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces to recuperate.</p>
<p>Words After the Illness: Not long after, he returned to Shanghai, and his brain disease became more severe. Every day, about half an hour after getting up in the morning, the illness would begin. First, his eyes would itch strangely, and then his brain would become dizzy. He could only recover after sleeping for another hour. Repeated treatments were ineffective. During his illness, he once chatted with the shop staff, saying that if God created a person, he must give him a healthy body, and then he can create all undertakings. Now my (Zhang referred to himself) illness is getting worse, and I foresee that I can do nothing in the future, which is no different from being useless. At that time, a state of厭世 was overflowing in his words. The family did not pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Told Fiancée: A few days ago, on the third day of the lunar New Year, Hongliang and his fiancée, Ms. Wang (21 years old), went to the Jincheng Theater to watch the sound film "New Woman." For some reason, he suddenly had an emotional outburst and made remarks about厭世. After watching the film, he said to his fiancée, "Life is boring, it is better to die. I will throw myself into the sea to find peace and quiet. I am really sorry for you."</p>
<p>Several Letters: At that time, Ms. Wang did not take it seriously and only comforted him slightly. Unexpectedly, Hongliang took the Hongxing ship to Ningbo alone on the third day (the fifth day of the lunar New Year). When the ship arrived at Wusongkou, he suddenly committed suicide by drowning himself. When people noticed, he had already died in the waves. Several letters were found, one addressed to his father, Linsheng, the content of which only asked his father not to be too sad, and all the books he left behind should be left as souvenirs for his younger siblings, or donated to the library. One was addressed to his fiancée, which mainly said that he suffered from neurasthenia and could not be cured after repeated treatments, and he had no interest in life. Therefore, it is better to die to avoid trouble. Ms. Wang cried and almost died when she received the letter and the returned engagement photos and wedding ring. She is now being comforted and guarded by her family. There was also a letter addressed to his shop staff, Chai Benwei and Zhao Lisheng, instructing them to help his father manage the shop. The remaining letters were addressed to his former classmates.</p>
<h3>Wang Boying Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The automobile was discovered yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Wang Boying, a native of Shaoxing, 38 years old, currently a director of the Datong Bookstore, resides at No. 17, Changfeng Lane, Tongfu Road. He usually travels in his own car, with concession registration No. 5321 and city registration No. 7827. Yesterday morning at 0:10, Wang was returning home after finishing some business outside. Just as the car arrived at the entrance of the lane and the driver, Feng Futang (from Ningbo), was about to honk the horn, three kidnappers, two men and one woman, suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two of the kidnappers, armed with pistols, jumped into the car, forced the driver to give up his seat, and one of them took over as the driver while the other two monitored Wang's movements. They sped away. After driving to the vicinity of the Great World amusement center, they pushed the driver out of the car and disappeared without a trace. The chauffeur then reported the incident to the police station, which informed all police stations and branches of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be on the lookout for the vehicle. Around 4:30 p.m. yesterday, the car was finally discovered near the intersection of Guofumen Road and Fuli Road in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren Hosts Farewell Dinner for Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>Inviting Hu Die and others to accompany</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Youren, along with playwright Ouyang Yuqian, hosted a banquet at Tang's residence on Ganse Road at 7:30 p.m. last night to bid farewell to the famous actor Mei Lanfang, who is about to travel to Russia to perform. They also invited Zhou Jianyun, the representative of China's participation in the International Film Exhibition, as well as Hu Die and many others to accompany them. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until after 9:00 p.m. It is reported that Mei Lanfang is scheduled to travel abroad on the "Northern" special ship between the 16th and 18th of this month. In addition to Yan Huiqing, the Chinese ambassador to Russia, those traveling with him include Zhou Jianyun and his wife, representatives of the Soviet Russian International Film Exhibition, Hu Die, Sun Guiji, playwright Yu Shangyuan, and Mei's entourage, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<h3>Unclaimed Automobile Discovered on Qimei Road</h3>
<p>Also, an unclaimed rickshaw</p>
<p>The inside story is still under investigation.</p>
<p>At around 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the Linping Road Public Security Bureau in Zhabei dispatched patrol officer Fang Chengwei, leading several police officers, to patrol the area. While passing the Erdao Bridge area of Qimei Road, they saw an empty car parked there. The municipal license plate number was 39773, and the concession registration number was 731. Patrol Officer Fang and the others noticed that there was no one managing the car, and even the driver was nowhere to be seen. They became suspicious. Although they pressed the car's horn, no one responded for a long time. They left a police officer to guard the car while the others investigated the surrounding area.</p>
<h3>Appeals of the Three Major Criminals Involved in the Assassination of Inspector Cao Qingcheng and Others Returned for Retrial</h3>
<p>The focus of the retrial is whether the seized gun was fired.</p>
<p>The High Court holds a closed-door retrial.</p>
<p>Cao Qingcheng, an inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau from Hubei, was leaving Wan's residence at No. 41, Yuancheng Lane, Lafayette Road in the French Concession to go shopping at around 1:00 p.m. on May 16, 1932. When he arrived at the entrance of Yuancheng Lane, he was suddenly ambushed by reactionary thugs. At the time, the assailants mistook the appearance of Jin Shoupei from Jiangwan, who lived at No. 25 in the same lane as Cao, and first shot Jin down. They then realized their mistake and chased Cao to Jiaole Road, shooting him dead. Jin also died from his serious injuries. When the incident occurred, French police detectives arrived after hearing the gunshots and pursued the assailants separately, capturing Liu Guobao (17 years old at the time) from Sichuan and Li Tushi Ying (22 years old at the time) from Henan. Two pistols with live ammunition were seized and brought back to the police station. Later that night, another accomplice, Li Zecai (40 years old) from Anhui, was apprehended, and two pistols, handcuffs, and saws were confiscated. It was found that Liu and others had also been involved in the assassination of Wang Bin, an inspector of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters Investigation Team, in front of Gu'en Temple on Virmont Road earlier that year. Because Liu and others belonged to the reactionary faction, the police department sent them to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, where they were prosecuted for endangering the Republic of China and premeditated murder. After the trial, Liu Guobao and Li Shiying were sentenced to long-term imprisonment for endangering the Republic of China and sentenced to death for premeditated murder. Li Zecai was sentenced to long-term imprisonment. Liu and the others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Nanjing Supreme Court, hoping to reduce their death sentences. After reviewing the entire case, the Supreme Court found that there were still some doubts that needed to be investigated in detail. Therefore, it ruled to revoke the original judgment and return the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. The details of these events have been reported in previous newspapers. The Third Branch of the High Court has now concluded its investigations and interrogations. A joint collegial panel was held the other day to summon the three appellants, Liu and the others, for questioning. Because the case involved politics, public attendance was prohibited. As a result of the trial, it was decided that the detectives handling the case at the police station should be summoned to testify. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned until the witnesses could be summoned to testify. The three defendants, Liu and the others, were returned to the detention center. It is also reported that the focus of this retrial is whether the pistols seized from Liu Guobao and Li Shiying had been fired. This matter needs to be studied in detail in order to reach a reliable verdict.</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>Nearby, another empty rickshaw was discovered. There was neither a rickshaw puller nor a passenger. The municipal license plate number was 16308, and the concession registration number was 6308. After calling out for a long time, the rickshaw puller did not respond. Patrol Officer Fang and the others saw that the two vehicles were found in the same place and were both unclaimed. They suspected something was amiss and tried to bring both vehicles back to the branch bureau and reported the information to the headquarters, requesting that all branch bureaus be notified to investigate together. Meanwhile, senior police detectives were dispatched to the location where the two vehicles were parked to conduct a detailed examination of the traces, but there were no developments.</p>
<h3>Directors of the Jia Hua Bank Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>Unmatured drafts</p>
<p>Were still cashed</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Jia Hua Savings Bank declared its closure on the 3rd of last month, but the Shanghai branch did not close at the same time. It was not until the 5th that it announced its closure. On the 4th, 13 households, including Jiang Zhongjia, Jiuhua Oil Company, Tang Dinglong Company, Dafeng, Zhaofeng, and others, deposited funds, totaling approximately 3,896 yuan, unaware that the bank was about to close. Among them, Jiang Zhongjia deposited three Jiading Bank drafts dated January 10, totaling 1,530 yuan. After the bank closed, he immediately sent a letter requesting that they stop cashing the drafts. However, they were still cashed when they matured. Jiang Zhongjia and the other 13 households believe that since the Jia Hua head office had already closed on January 3rd, the Shanghai branch should have closed at the same time. However, it continued to operate for one day on the 4th and only announced its liquidation on the 5th, causing them to suffer losses. This constitutes obvious fraudulent behavior. Furthermore, they were notified to stop cashing the drafts that had not yet matured, but they did not comply. According to the Savings Bank Law, they should have deposited sufficient assets in the custody of the Central Bank as security for the repayment of savings deposits, but the bank did not do so. Therefore, they hired lawyer Ni Gang to file a complaint with the civil court of the First Special District Court, accusing the branch's directors Zhao Jinqing, He Fusang, Li Yaobang, Zhang Danru, Deng Zhaozhen, Lin Zhi Zhou, Zhong Biao, supervisor Zhang Xinji, general manager Tan Xitian, manager Bai Hongji, deputy manager Shen Hegao, and others, requesting that the court order them to return the deposits of 3,896 yuan and bear the costs of litigation. At the same time, they requested a declaration of provisional execution. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Qinglan of the Civil Division 4 of the First Special District Court summoned the defendants, but none of them appeared. After reviewing the case, the judge ordered that another hearing be scheduled for questioning.</p>
<h3>The Robbery at the Public Works Bureau Iron Factory Was Premeditated</h3>
<p>Informed by an inside worker</p>
<p>A lodging was rented to discuss</p>
<p>On the 1st of this month, at 1:55 p.m., when the Engineering Department Iron Factory of the Public Works Bureau at 630 Maohai Road was distributing wages and year-end bonuses, it was invaded by robbers who stole paper money worth 20,714 yuan. As a result, Chinese detective Zhang Youming and Chinese constable No. 377 apprehended Zhou A'gen, a native of Liyang. Chen Xiao Wu Zi was shot on the spot and died from his injuries. Stolen money worth 18,709 yuan and a blue cloth package were confiscated. Subsequently, Chinese Detective Chief Shang Wu of the Huishi Police Station apprehended four accomplices, including Liu Xiao Wu Zi, Wang A'fu, and suspects Wang Zhenrong and Chen Guangyi, at No. 55, Huasheng Road in the French Concession. They were separately escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial in the Criminal Division 3 yesterday. Public Works Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the robbery had been discussed and agreed upon a month in advance at Chen Xiao Wu Zi's house at No. 83, Zhangjiagang, Zhabei, and at the Yingbin Inn on Fuzhou Road. On the day of the incident, Liu Xiao Wu Zi helped deliver the aforementioned paper money to the accounting room upstairs (because he was one of the factory's workers). After leaving the factory for a break, he joined several others who were at large to carry out the robbery. They planned to divide the loot in a rented house at No. 34, Yucai Road, Zhabei. Unexpectedly, Zhou A'gen was captured on the spot. Currently, 2,005 yuan is missing. However, the iron box that they hastily dropped next to the scene of the robbery has been found with all the money. When questioned, Zhou A'gen confessed that the deceased Chen Xiao Wu Zi, along with a person surnamed Li and an older man, entered the room at that time. Shortly after, Chen handed him a blue cloth package containing banknotes and told him to leave quickly, or they would shoot him. Liu Xiao Wu Zi confessed that the deceased initiated the plan. He revealed where the factory's wages were distributed because he was on break. Wang A'fu confessed that he did not enter the factory at the time but was watching the surroundings outside. Wang Zhenrong and Chen Guangyi insisted that they went to No. 55, Huasheng Road in the French Concession to visit Wang A'fu on that day and knew nothing else. They pleaded for leniency. Judge Jiang ordered that they be returned to custody for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gong Shaoting's Case of Killing His Concubine and Dismembering the Body to Cover Up the Crime to Be Tried Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Prosecuted by the prosecutor after investigation</p>
<p>Criminal court to try it tomorrow and call the team leader who solved the case to testify</p>
<p>Gong Shaoting, the owner of Gong Hongtai Construction Factory at Gongxing Bridge South, Baoxing Road, Zhabei, colluded with his new concubine, Ms. Hou, and his son-in-law, Shen Fufu, on the 21st day of the third month of the lunar calendar in 1933 to strangle his old concubine, Xie A'qiao (also known as Sister A'qiao), whom he had known for more than 20 years, with a rope and bury her body under the construction site. The area has now been built with houses, and no one noticed at the time. Later, Gong Shaoting was deeply worried and secretly instructed Zhou Baoquan, who was guarding the construction site, to dismember the body with Li Baosheng, Liu Guisheng, and others and move it to another place. Xie Baolin, a nephew of the deceased, learned of the matter and was shocked. He immediately reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team. Team leader Zhou Peisan was dispatched to conduct a secret investigation and confirmed the facts. Gong Shaoting, Ms. Gong Hou, and Zhou Baoquan, Li Baosheng, and other male and female offenders were arrested and brought to the local court. After repeated inquiries by prosecutor Lei Binzhang, it was confirmed that Xie A'qiao's headless body was found under the third room of the newly built house at Gongxing Bridge South. However, the head has not been found after repeated searches, because Liu Guisheng had moved and buried it several times. Therefore, Liu must be arrested in order for the head to be located. The investigation of this case has now been concluded. Gong Shaoting, Ms. Gong Hou, and Shen Fufu have been charged with premeditated murder and damaging and abandoning a corpse, which constitute crimes under Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 262, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. Zhou Baoquan, Li Baosheng, and Li Guisheng (i.e., Liu Guisheng) have been charged with abandoning a corpse, which constitutes a crime under Article 262, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. The prosecution was filed with the Criminal Court, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Judge Zhang Peiming of the Local Court has scheduled a public trial for the afternoon of the 12th of this month (i.e., tomorrow) and ordered Team Leader Zhou Peisan and the detectives who solved the case to come to the court to testify at the appointed time.</p>

<h3>The Ministry Orders Shanghai-Ping Commuter Train Not to Carry Passengers Across the River in Heavy Fog</h3>
<p>The Two-Route Administration Transmits the Order to the Traffic Department for Compliance</p>
<p>Since the completion of the ferry service for the Shanghai-Ping commuter train, north- and south-bound trains have been directly ferried across the river upon arrival at the riverbank. After the jolting caused by wind and waves during the river crossing on November 26th of last year, the Ministry of Railways approved that if the wind and waves on the Yangtze River were too strong and unfavorable for navigation, the Shanghai-Ping commuter train should temporarily delay crossing the river. On the night of January 10th of this year, when heavy fog made navigation difficult, the ferry service was suspended. All passengers and luggage on the No. 302 Shanghai-bound train from the north and the No. 301 Ping-bound train from the south were transported back and forth across the river in three trips by the Jinpu Railway using ferries. The train numbers were exchanged, and the trains were returned to Shanghai and Ping respectively. After the Two-Route Administration reported this matter to the Ministry, it has now been instructed that using small boats to transport passengers back and forth in heavy fog is still dangerous. In the future, if the same situation occurs, passenger safety should be the top priority. It is better to delay the train than to take risks. Passengers should be informed of this in advance to avoid misunderstandings and accusations. The Two-Route Administration has ordered the Traffic Department to comply yesterday.</p>

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Two Paths Regarding Japan (Continued) by Lin Bosheng</h3>
<p>After Reading Xu Daolin's "A Review of Sino-Japanese Relations"</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>The stalemate in the situation with Japan is difficult to break. Since this is the case, we cannot yet discuss being either enemies or friends. Therefore, China at present must prepare for two paths: only these two paths exist, and there is no other way.</p>
<p>First, we must maintain the resolve to coexist or perish with the four northeastern provinces, existing together if they exist, perishing together if they perish. As mentioned above, Japan's "advance into the continent" has no end. Since its goal is not only the Northeast, if we lose the Northeast today, we will lose Chahar and Hebei tomorrow. This situation is similar to a frog being killed. If a frog is chopped into several pieces, each piece will still jump and twitch. With each cut, it cries out and jumps, until every part is completely dissected, without realizing it has long been dead. The death of the frog is like this. China's dismemberment over the past forty years has also been like this. Seeing this situation today, we are all in a desperate situation. Instead of living in degradation and being slowly tortured to death, why not summon our spirit and fight to the death in a most heroic battle? This is the first path.</p>
<p>If we take this path, we must first recognize that it is a path of sacrifice. Having made the resolution to sacrifice, we must "clench our teeth and not complain." The government should not complain because fundraising is unsuccessful or calls are unanswered. The people should not complain because they are impoverished and displaced. Soldiers should not complain because they are hungry, cold, and poorly supplied. Because China is a miserable China, and the Chinese people are miserable Chinese people. Misery is destined, so we should prepare to endure hardship and not complain casually."</p>
<p>Secondly, we must recognize that this is a path to death, because China today is truly just a frog. Even if we fight with all the strength of the nation, there is no certainty of victory. Whether we can concentrate the nation's power is even less certain. We should not console ourselves by thinking of Belgium during the European War. Proportionally speaking, Belgium is much stronger than us in terms of national defense, politics, economy, transportation, and social organization. Moreover, when Belgium declared war on Germany, Russia and France had already declared war on Germany, and Britain was preparing to mobilize. Belgium's declaration of war on Germany was participation in the war, not a solo response. How can our current situation compare to Belgium's? Nor should we take the resurrected Turkey as an example. After twenty years of continuous war, relying on geographical and international relations, Turkey retreated far to Ankara, fought hard, and only then had its final day of revival. However, the revived Turkey had lost one-third of its population and half of its territory. Do we have a place to retreat to today? Do we have the opportunity for a long-term, arduous struggle? If, as a result of the arduous struggle, we could establish a small government on a small piece of land, adding another antique to the history of fallen nations in the world, that would be good. But I am afraid that it will collapse and be divided into four or five pieces, and even this is impossible. Therefore, having made the determination to sacrifice, we must hold the idea of seeking death and must not cling to any examples or indulge in wishful thinking. We do not want to retreat, we want to sacrifice. We do not want to survive ignobly, we want to seek death, so that perhaps we can find life in the midst of nine deaths.</p>
<p>Second, we must recognize the current situation, that the four northeastern provinces cannot be recovered by force. In this case, we can only follow what Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek have repeatedly telegraphed, establishing a minimum limit. The so-called minimum limit means resolving not to recognize the puppet Manchuria. Within the minimum limit, we can be tolerant and seek compromise. But if we go beyond the minimum limit, then we can only break off relations and sacrifice, preferring death to dishonor.</p>
<p>This approach has three functions:</p>
<p>First, while making every effort to be tolerant, we must also make twelve points of effort to do preparatory work and to strengthen national power. The so-called preparation and strengthening must be done practically and realistically, not just talked about emptily. The less we say, the more we think in our hearts, and the more we do with our hands.</p>
<p>Second, with the Chinese nation's attitude of tolerance, determination to sacrifice, and spirit of struggle, we may be able to move the Japanese to realize that being enemies with China is not as good as being friends with China. In this way, the issue of the four northeastern provinces may be peacefully resolved, achieving the goal of recovering lost territory through peaceful means.</p>
<p>Third, while being tolerant and preparing, we must wait for the shift in the international situation. This is not hoping for a world war as a way to survive ignobly. We must understand that before our national power is strengthened, if a great war breaks out, China will not only lack the qualifications to participate in the war, but also lack the qualifications to remain neutral. We will not even be able to bow down and rely on the powerful. For example, if two tigers fight, at least a leopard is needed to have a significant impact. If it is a sheep, then it can only wait for sacrifice. If the first tiger wins, the sheep is unlucky. If the second tiger wins, the sheep is still unlucky. Moreover, I am afraid that before the outcome is decided, it will already be food for the hungry tiger! Today's China is just a sheep, surrounded by tigers. Do we still want to survive ignobly? There are not few lessons in history. The Russo-Japanese War is an ironclad precedent.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that this approach requires both the determination to sacrifice and the effort to prepare, both strengthening national defense and utilizing diplomacy.</p>
<p>Why do we say that we must have both the determination to sacrifice and the effort to prepare?</p>
<p>Because we want to sacrifice, so we must prepare. Only with preparation can we talk about sacrifice. Conversely, without the determination to sacrifice, we are not qualified to talk about preparation; without the strength to prepare, we are not qualified to talk about sacrifice. To put it another way, with the determination to sacrifice, this preparation has meaning. With the strength to prepare, this sacrifice has value.</p>
<p>Because (1) the international crisis is imminent, and we do not know how much time we will have to prepare; (2) China is a victim and a weak country, and we do not know how much possibility there is for preparation; (3) China is a backward country, and in politics, economy, military, science, and even social organization, we are inferior to others in every aspect. We do not know how much certainty there is in preparation. We will prepare, but our enemies will prepare even more. If we prepare one point, our enemies will prepare twelve points. Therefore, we cannot calculate how much preparation is needed before we sacrifice. We can only plan to sacrifice at all times and strive to prepare at all times, preparing for one minute if we can, preparing for one drop if we can. When we have one breath left, we will use all our strength to prepare. When we reach the minimum limit, we will sacrifice. The more prepared we are, the more valuable the sacrifice will be. Only with such continuous effort and unremitting struggle can we achieve the ultimate goal of national salvation and survival.</p>
<p>Why do we say that we must strengthen national defense and utilize diplomacy?</p>
<p>Because without the strength of national defense, there is no way to talk about diplomacy. For example, in business, national defense is like the quality of goods, and diplomacy is like advertising. There is a golden rule in advertising: extensive advertising can attract business, but it can also ruin business. Because if the quality of the goods is good, naturally the more advertising, the better the business. But if the quality of the goods is bad, wouldn't more advertising be more disastrous? In the past, there was a domestic cigarette company whose cigarettes were defeated effortlessly by a foreign cigarette company at the height of their sales. Whenever the Chinese cigarettes were produced, the foreign cigarette company spent a lot of money to buy them in batches and put them in damp and smelly old warehouses. Only after these cigarettes were completely moldy did they take them out and sell them to the market in large quantities. At this time, these cigarettes were very popular. The more popular they were, the more people bought them, and the more widespread the sale of moldy cigarettes became. Today, if you buy a pack, it is moldy; tomorrow, if you buy a pack, it is still moldy. Originally a very popular and super-grade cigarette, it earned a bad reputation for moldy cigarettes for this reason. Smokers are very particular. They will smoke good cigarettes no matter what, but they will not smoke bad cigarettes even if they are given to them. Therefore, everyone who had been deceived changed to smoking other cigarettes, and over time, this cigarette disappeared from the market. From this, we can see that although advertising is the supreme tool for attracting business, the application of advertising must have limits, and there must also be a necessary condition, which is that the quality of the goods must be good. The same principle applies to diplomacy: diplomacy is the supreme tool for helping national defense, but the use of diplomacy must also have limits, especially a necessary condition, which is that there must be a strong national defense. "A weak country needs diplomacy" is a saying to encourage oneself, but "a weak country has no diplomacy" is a real situation.</p>
<p>Conversely, the role of diplomacy cannot be ignored. On January 8 this year, Wang Jingwei said the following in a speech at the National Government Memorial Week:</p>
<p>"The role of diplomacy should not be overestimated, but it should not be underestimated either. For example, if national defense has considerable strength, then the role of diplomacy can at least have the following two points: one is passive, in other words, it is to reduce the number of enemy countries. For example, Bismarck planned to fight Denmark, but first tried to prevent Austria from participating. When fighting Austria, he first tried to prevent France from participating. When fighting France, he first tried to prevent Austria from participating. Because at that time, Prussia's military strength was adequate to deal with one enemy country, with the possibility of victory, but not enough to deal with two enemy countries, which would inevitably lead to failure. Dealing with one enemy country naturally requires the military force of national defense, without which there is no way to talk about it. But to prevent two enemy countries from emerging requires the use of diplomacy. Therefore, Germany in the Bismarck era won every battle, which is vastly different from Germany's disastrous defeat in the European War, and from this we can see the importance of diplomatic relations. The second is active, in other words, it is to increase the number of allied countries. For example, after the Franco-Prussian War, France was in no way able to be an enemy of Germany. The biggest reason was that Germany had more than 70 million people, while France had only more than 30 million. It must be understood that when two countries face each other, if one has a large population but is poor, weak, and foolish, and the other has a small population but is rich, strong, and wise, then it is shameful for the one with the large population to be controlled by the one with the small population, because who told you to be poor, weak, and foolish? As for wealth, strength, wisdom, and so on being equal, but the population is different, then it is not only not shameful, but also deserving of human sympathy. France was far inferior to Germany in terms of population, and was always in fear of being destroyed. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the military force of national defense, France also paid attention to diplomacy, first forming an alliance with Russia, then negotiating with Britain, and then even managed to get Italy and the United States to join, and thus actually defeated Germany. Naturally, if France had not had a considerable military force for national defense, neither Russia, Britain, Italy, nor the United States would have joined him in fighting together, but if there was only military force for national defense and no diplomacy, then there would be no hope of victory. The effectiveness of diplomacy can be seen here again."</p>
<p>From this, the value of diplomacy can be imagined, because with the military force to deal with the enemy country, plus diplomacy, it can reduce the enemy's military force by one country or more, or it can increase its own military force by one country or more. No wonder diplomacy and military affairs are given equal importance. Therefore, strengthening national defense and utilizing diplomacy are interdependent, like auxiliary troops, like lips and teeth, like the two wings of a bird, mutually indispensable.</p>
<p>Diplomacy is necessary, whether preparing to be enemies with people or to be friends with people, it is necessary to make good use of diplomacy actively. Only if you can be friends with people can you be enemies with people. Conversely, if you cannot be friends with people, you are not qualified to be enemies with people.</p>
<p>National defense is also necessary, whether preparing to be enemies with people or to be friends with people, it is necessary to have considerable military force. Only if you can be enemies with people can you be friends with people. Conversely, if you cannot be enemies with people, you are not even qualified to be friends with people."</p>
<p>The above describes one path to death and one path to endure humiliation and survive. No matter which path you take, you have to endure hardship and pain. In the world, there are precedents for recovering lost territory by force, and there are also precedents for recovering lost territory by peaceful means. Both require enduring hardship and pain. Recovering lost territory by force, such as France, after the Franco-Prussian War, adhered to the motto of "always thinking in your heart, but not saying it out loud," enduring hardship for forty years like a day, and even then it took a full four years of fighting to recover Alsace-Lorraine. How easy is it to recover lost territory by force? Recovering lost territory by peaceful means, such as Germany, after the European War, swallowed its anger, buried its head in hard work, tasted all kinds of hardships, suffered all kinds of setbacks, and roused the spirit of the whole country. Only today has it been able to recover Saar by plebiscite, and whether it can receive it safely depends on the faces of the powerful. How easy is it to recover lost territory by peaceful means? We must also know that in the Franco-Prussian War, France went through a heroic war before making peace, and after making peace, it still had the strength to avenge its humiliation. In the European War, Germany also went through a heroic war before making peace, and after making peace, it was still able to maintain its sovereignty and independence, and still retain some national spirit. As for us, in fact, we are like a defeated country, and in form, we are not even as good as a defeated country. The hardships ahead can be imagined.</p>
<p>If someone asks, are we going to be friends with Japan or enemies with Japan? Then we can answer:</p>
<p>If we take the first path, we must first have the courage to seek death and the determination to sacrifice. Since we are all going to die, it is better to die without dishonor than to die in dishonor. Being enemies or friends is not something to be considered.</p>
<p>If we take the second path, we must not only have the determination to sacrifice, but also the perseverance to prepare. Without strength, there is no way to talk about being enemies or friends at all.</p>
<p>This is how we view the issue of Japan. Which path to take is up to the people to choose. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>The habitually rouge-eating Jia Baoyu said, "Women are made of water, and men are made of mud." Then mud easily dissolves when it encounters water, and water easily becomes polluted when it encounters mud. By analogy, it is no wonder that in modern society, young men are easily bewitched by women, and girls under the age of sixteen are easily violated by men. Jia Baoyu's catchphrase has become a kind of eternal sinful language between men and women. After all, an expert in love affairs has a different view than ordinary people when he utters a sentence.</p>
<p>— (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>The weather is cold. The hot water bottle proudly said to the fan with a smile: "Where is your former power? You are also out of season this time." Upon hearing this, the fan also replied with a sarcastic smile: "Don't put on airs and bully people. What will happen to you next summer?" The hot water bottle had no words to say. All people are like this. Wealth and poverty, high and low, circulate endlessly. As the saying goes, the feng shui changes every sixty years.</p>

<h3>The Xiong Mao Wedding Story</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Marriage is a common thing, and there is no need to be surprised. However, Xiong and Mao's wedding yesterday attracted the attention of the masses at sea, which was really "something." Xiong Xiling once held political power, and in his later years, he devoted himself to charitable work. The well-known Xiangshan Children's Home in Beiping, both at home and abroad, was his handiwork. Ms. Mao Yanwen is currently a university professor and is a pioneer in the women's world. Now that the two families are united in marriage, it is precisely the old husband's sixty-six and the new wife's thirty-three; white hair in pairs, rosy cheeks facing each other; this is enough for people to enjoy and spread as a good story. In the country, the combination of white hair and rosy cheeks is indeed rare. In European and American countries, it is not a strange story.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong not only has no signs of old age, but also has a renewed ambition, with a "growing stronger in old age" look. Recently, following the instructions of his new wife, he cut off his beard that had been grown for twenty years, which will inevitably lead to criticism from the old society; but I admire his thinking, which is standing in front of the times, regardless of all feudal remnants of concepts, and the incomplete views of the vulgar. This spirit is more meaningful than Hu Shi's praise of Jiang Menglin's marriage to Tao Zenggu for his so-called "courage." (Xiong's is a second marriage, Jiang's is a remarriage.) I have always had sympathy for those who advocate celibacy in the world. Since Xiong married Mao, it can awaken the general bachelors and spinsters. Considering the future of the nation, this reporter has high hopes.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>I have known Ms. Mao for a long time, and I have often talked about China's education problems, women's movement, and even the news industry today. I deeply admire her extraordinary thinking and outstanding knowledge. Now that she has married a satisfactory husband, I hope that in addition to supporting her husband and raising her children, she will contribute more to education and charity. This is the duty of a pioneer woman. One day, I was returning from Zhenru, and I happened to be in the same car as Ms. Mao. She said that she liked reading newspapers since she was a child, from elementary school to middle school, university, and even during her stay in the United States, she has been an old reader of the Shen Bao for twenty years, which is also worth reporting to everyone.</p>
<h3>Autograph Book</h3>
<p>— Shi Jihong</p>
<p>Recently, in the ranks of young people in the city, a kind of autograph book bound in hard covers of various colored foreign papers is very popular. The cover is烫ed with a gold "Autograph," which is worth at least forty or fifty cents, and the larger and more exquisitely leather-bound ones are worth several dollars!</p>
<p>People who have such an autograph book are qualified to be asked to sign a name and write a few words whenever they meet someone who has even a fleeting acquaintance with them. It doesn't matter whether it's one or two, or even a long paragraph of writing it on one or two pages; what's more, some people, in addition to writing a few words, add the finishing touch by drawing a few figures or other beautiful pictures and their own photos, which will make the original owner of that book pleasantly surprised, and so grateful that they thank them horizontally and apologize vertically, which is simply unbearable.</p>
<p>After this autograph book is filled, it must have passed through the hands of nearly a hundred people. Although it is only a thin booklet, it can be said that none of the inscriptions are exactly the same. Each has its own posture, its own handwriting and thinking. From a small autograph book, we can see the different forms of a part of the people in the world:</p>
<p>If this autograph book passes after a number of years, each of the people who inscribed it at that time, some have already soared to prominence and become arrogant, and some are destitute all their lives and no longer have the interest to write in other people's autograph books. And the original owner of this book must have changed along with his personality and the influence of the environment, it is definitely not the situation when he bought it, nor is it something that could have been imagined in advance at that time.</p>
<p>No wonder it has been so popular in the ranks of young people recently! It can tell a person's future fate.</p>
<h3>European Eagle's Excretion</h3>

<h3>The Wang Surname at Every Door</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shouruo)</p>
<p>"Everyone wants face, every tree wants bark." Therefore, it is common for poor people to maintain appearances even in death, and it is not an exception.</p>
<p>Pawning clothes and belongings is also considered a loss of face in the eyes of the poor. Therefore, when a poor person goes to a pawnshop, they are afraid of being recognized and unwilling to reveal their real name, to avoid embarrassment. The amusing story of "The Wang Surname at Every Door" thus formed and remains to this day.</p>
<p>In the pawnshops of Pudong, there is not a single local customer who does not use the surname Wang on their pawn tickets. Therefore, everyone who goes to pawn something, regardless of whether they are Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, or Zheng, is forced to take the surname Wang. Out of curiosity, I once asked a friend who worked in a pawnshop and learned the history behind it. Originally, when customers pawned items, if asked their surname, they were unwilling to reveal it and would casually answer "Wang." (This was probably because there were many people with the surname Wang in Pudong, making it a common surname.) The pawnshop clerk, knowing that the given name was false, had no choice but to write down the Wang surname. Later, because they often couldn't get the real name, they avoided the trouble and simply wrote down Wang for everyone. Over time, this became an unbreakable habit.</p>
<h3>Small Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: A Remote Place with a Minor Official, A Strong-Willed Envoy Comes from Afar; A Grand Feast in the Main Hall, While Outside There are Pitiful Creatures.</p>
<p>His eyes, however, were secretly watching the mother and daughter to see how they were. He then heard the woman say with a miserable tone: "Child, let's go back." Yueying said: "We haven't met the master and mistress who want to hire people yet. If we go back like this, Grandma will scold us, and Aunt will also scold us. If you can't stand, just sit for a while. Are you cold?" Her mother, Mrs. Hu, said: "Being cold doesn't matter, I just hope Buddha blesses us and things work out." Zhang Jiefu saw from a distance that she was leaning against the wall and slowly sitting down on the slightly higher earthen base at the foot of the wall. Yueying's face was clearly looking in this direction. However, every time Zhang Jiefu walked towards her, she would turn her face away. No matter how thick-skinned Jiefu was, he couldn't find a way to approach, so he had to walk around a few more times and return to his room. When he looked into Zhiqian's room, no one was there, and the lights were very dim, so Cheng Zhiqian must have gone to the main dining hall in front. Walking outside the window and looking inside, he saw gasoline lamps emitting a brilliant silver light, illuminating a hall full of guests sitting around a long dining table about two zhang long. The table was covered with a snow-white tablecloth, and the silver knives and forks and tall glasses were neatly arranged along the edge of the table. Most of the male guests were wearing neatly folded Western suits, and the rest were in silk clothes. Among them were several women wearing deep red and light green cheongsams, matched with snow-white faces, vermilion lips, and curled hair, all of which were rarely seen in Xi'an. Precisely because of this, it was enough to prove that this banquet was extraordinary. It was not surprising that the women's faces were covered with rouge and powder. The men's faces, however, were all beaming with joy. Cheng Zhiqian was also there, squeezed among the crowd, talking and laughing with friends. (130)</p>
<h3>The Vague Record of Imperial Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"If our child were still alive," the Empress Dowager's voice softened again. "I think with his intelligence and courage, he would have accomplished great things. Our country, under the rule of such a capable monarch, would not be in such a terrible state! ... Counting the years, he would be fifty-six years old today."</p>
<p>It turned out that Tongzhi was born in 1847 by the Gregorian calendar. Fourteen years later, his father, Xianfeng, died, and he inherited the throne under the protection of the Empress Dowager. At that time, he was said to be fourteen years old, but in reality, he was only thirteen years old and a few months. No wonder the dragon robe he wore at his coronation, which we saw in those ancient palaces the other day, was so small!</p>
<p>Although the Empress Dowager was still forcing herself to talk to me, she was truly extremely depressed in her heart. And whenever she was in such a state of depression, her temper would become exceptionally bad. We stole glances at her and saw a kind of indescribable majesty that would make people break out in a cold sweat. If everything outside was quiet and we did nothing to annoy her, then she would sit silently for half a day or a day, as if she didn't see anyone. But if something annoyed her, then there would be trouble! No matter how trivial the matter, she would not let it go. She would definitely fly into a rage, causing unrest throughout the palace. And once that happened, she would hate that person or that thing to the core, remembering it with resentment even after three or five years. It seems that a woman's resentment is always more tenacious and enduring than a man's, and the Empress Dowager was especially unwilling to let people off easily. (240)</p>
<p>Little Common Knowledge</p>
<h3>Yawns and Tears</h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>(1) Yawns are contagious. Why do yawns occur? From a physiological point of view, a yawn is a type of deep breath, caused by an abnormal state of blood circulation in the respiratory center, unconsciously triggering a reflex. In other words, because of mental fatigue, blood circulation becomes abnormal. After a yawn, the air in the lungs is refreshed, meaning that air with more oxygen is absorbed into the blood through the lungs. At the same time, the muscles of the whole body become tense, which can temporarily alleviate the feeling of fatigue. Therefore, yawns are indispensable for human life. In simple terms, a yawn is a natural regulation of breathing, triggering a reflex movement throughout the body. So, when you feel like yawning, if you are afraid of being embarrassed and try to suppress it, then you will not be able to alleviate the fatigue, and a second yawn will still occur. The strangest thing is that when one person yawns, people nearby will also start yawning one after another. This is the contagion of yawns. However, the contagion of yawns is different from the contagion of diseases or thoughts. Among animals, only fish also yawn. After five or six normal breathing movements in the water, a fish will definitely have a special gill-moving yawn. The breathing of cattle and horses resembles yawns, but it is actually different from that of humans. (2) Where do tears come from? There is an expression in English, "crocodile tears," which is a metaphor for fake tears, meaning that the person is crying for no reason. Legend has it that lizards living in the wilderness of Baja California often shed bloody tears. This is because the lizard is very peaceful. When it is stimulated or excited, the blood in its body rises to its head, and the blood filling its eyelids is about three times the usual amount, so blood overflows from the upper eyelids. This is the same principle as when an angry person's eyelids become bloodshot. However, why do humans cry? This question is worthy of interesting research. According to physiological research, our tears flow out of several tiny tubes inside the upper eyelids, and part of them flows into the small gap in the lower eyelid, passing through the tear sac, and flowing out of the nasal cavity through the tear duct. Therefore, being exposed to strong fragrances or other stimuli will cause tears to flow, promoting the secretion of the lacrimal glands, which moisten the conjunctiva of the eyes. After the inside of the eye is moistened by tears, it becomes very clean. Generally, when crying severely, the nasal cavity will also discharge mucus, which is what is called "tears and snot flowing together." When children experience pain or hunger, they will cry. As a result, the blood vessels in the eyes dilate, while the surrounding muscles contract, the lacrimal glands start to function, and tears are secreted abnormally. Therefore, children will cry at the slightest discomfort, while adults need to have deep emotions to shed tears. Apes and elephants among animals can also shed tears and weep. When a cow is about to be slaughtered, it will see the butcher holding a knife and tears will stream down its face, because the animal understands human intentions.</p>

<h3>International Sports Association Re-Specifies Track and Field Timing Methods</h3>
<p>One-Tenth of a Second for Distances Within 1000 Meters</p>
<p>One-Fifth of a Second for Distances Above 1000 Meters</p>
<p>The Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation announced yesterday that, according to the special regulations of the International Sports Association in 1928 regarding the application of timing in track and field events, one-fifth of a second timing was used for distances above 250 meters, and one-tenth of a second was used for distances below that. The International Sports Association Congress in Los Angeles in 1932 discussed and resolved to change the method. In August 1934, a meeting was held in Stockholm, and after examining the opinions of participating countries, a majority vote was passed, and the regulations for the timing method were determined as follows, to be applied by all countries: one-tenth of a second timing will be used for distances of 1000 meters or less, and one-fifth of a second timing will be used for distances above 1000 meters.</p>
<h3>The Hard-Won Victory of Macklin: The Black Eagles Fought Valiantly and Lost</h3>
<p>Result: 52 to 34</p>
<p>The Closest Gap Was Only Three Points</p>
<p>The Qingdao Black Eagles basketball team played Macklin again last night. There were only about 200 spectators, but the game was quite exciting and the situation was extremely tense. As a result, the Black Eagles still lost by a score of 34 to 52, but the entire team performed very well. Kong Guangyi's shooting and long-range shots were accurate nine out of ten times, earning him continuous applause. It was a pity that the forwards were slow in their movements under the opponent's basket, and the guards were short and suffered a lot. Otherwise, although Macklin's foreign players were strong, it would not have been easy for them to win last night. The team will play its last game against the Pirates tomorrow night, still at the Shenyuan Basketball Court.</p>
<p>Macklin Shows Its Power After the jump ball at center court, Yu Genxiang scored two consecutive shots from the corner, taking the lead. Macklin was not willing to be outdone. Shanluoke opened the scoring and then scored eight points in one go. Yu Genxiang and Kong Guangyi continued to score, tying the score at eight to eight. At this time, the situation was quite tense and the competition was fierce. Macklin took advantage of their height and actively moved under the basket, making it difficult for the Black Eagles guards to defend. The score went from 11 to 8, 17 to 10, and 23 to 12. The Black Eagles fell further and further behind. The first half ended with a score of 25 to 14.</p>
<p>Only Three Points Behind Starting in the second half, the Black Eagles worked hard to rally. Kong Guangyi showed his skills, making several long-range shots, all of which hit the mark. Zhang Yucai and Ding Shouyu also scored repeatedly, boosting the team's morale. In an instant, they narrowed the gap to 26 to 29. Seeing that the situation was not good, Macklin urgently called a timeout. But the momentum of the Black Eagles was still rising. After two free throws by Zhang Yucai, Qingfu added another goal, making the score 30 to 33. This was the closest the score had been throughout the entire game. The situation was tense, and the spectators cheered continuously.</p>
<p>Still Losing In the end, the Black Eagles were still inferior in strength. At this critical moment, they were unable to rise to the occasion. On the contrary, they saw the opponent's flames rise even higher. Tall players Locke, Jones, and Griffin colluded together to perform miracles. The score soared upwards, and the Black Eagles' defense became more and more chaotic. The situation was irrecoverable. In the end, Yu Genxiang only scored one goal, and the team suffered a crushing defeat with a final score of 34 to 52. Referees: Le Xiurong, Shi Zhaokang</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association, Donghua Defeats Zhenru Yesterday</h3>
<p>50 to 34</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held two games yesterday: (1) In the B3 group, Jidui defeated Xinguang, with a score of 17 to 2 in the first half and a total score of 36 to 7. (2) In the A1 group, Donghua defeated Zhenru, 50 to 34.</p>
<p>Donghua Defeats Zhenru</p>
<p>Donghua performed extremely well in the first half, with quick connections and a dominant position. Chen Xianglong's shooting was particularly accurate, scoring as many as 18 points, which was especially commendable. In the second half, Zhenru actively counterattacked, and Wang Nanzhen ran back and forth, showing great strength. However, because the difference in score was too great in the first half, they still lost with a score of 34 to 50.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education Draft General Outline of Measures for Children's Year</h3>
<p>Regarding the proposal to designate the 24th year [of the Republic] as Children's Year, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education have already consulted and drafted a concrete general outline of measures. The two ministries will jointly submit the measures to the Executive Yuan for approval in the near future, and the full text of the measures will be promulgated. However, it is heard that since February has already begun and is almost halfway over, the measures for Children's Year, which are awaiting joint promulgation, will still take some days. Therefore, they will not be promulgated at the beginning of the year but will be implemented from Children's Day, April 4th, to April 4th of the following year. This one year will be the beginning of Children's Year. For the first year, after the measures are promulgated, a central organization committee (organized by the three departments of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, with the Central People's Guidance Committee invited to participate in guidance) will be formed for the implementation of Children's Year. Local committees (jointly formed by the Education Bureau and administrative organs, with local party headquarters invited to participate in guidance) will also be formed. When stipulating the measures, the Ministry of Education will include detailed provisions regarding education and care for children, while the Ministry of Interior will focus on children's health. The full text is expected to be promulgated in about a week or so after approval by the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Anhui Education News</h3>
<p>Results of the Examination for Loans for Impoverished Students Announced: The Anhui Education Department previously held an examination for student loans to assist outstanding impoverished students. After deliberation by the provincial government, the passing standard was set at 65 points or above, with the condition that Chinese, Mathematics, and Foreign Language scores were not below 50 points. A total of 25 students were admitted, with 21 already enrolled in universities, mostly at Central University and Anhui University. Four students have not yet entered university.

<p>Exemption from Security Deposits and Book Fees: Previously, Anhui Normal Schools charged a security deposit of ten yuan upon enrollment, and vocational schools also followed suit. The Department of Education deemed this security deposit unnecessary and issued a notice to all normal and vocational schools, instructing them not to charge it in the future. Students who had already paid the deposit would be refunded at the beginning of this semester. Additionally, schools previously charged a book fee. The Department of Education also noted that the regular expenses of the schools already included provisions for book fees, and the Educational Supplies Consumer Cooperative had been established.

<h3>China Public School Board of Directors Decides to Appoint Chen Jicheng as Vice President</h3>
<p>Discuss Enhancing Content and Constructing School Buildings</p>
<p>Striving for Development to Achieve the Goal of Revival</p>
<p>China Public School was founded during the late Qing Dynasty when thousands of students studying in Japan returned to China to protest the Japanese Ministry of Education's crackdown regulations. They rented houses in Shanghai to establish the school. In the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign, the Qing government allocated over one hundred mu of public land on Mount Baotai in Wusong as school grounds. School buildings were constructed the following year. Zhang Qian, Xiong Xiling, Sun Yat-sen, Huang Xing, Liang Qichao, Hu Shih, Ma Junwu, Shao Lizi, and others successively came forward to maintain the school. Initially, a middle school was established, followed by normal, physics and chemistry, English, and mathematics specialized courses. In the first year of the Republic, three specialized classes in law, politics, and commerce were added. In the autumn of the eleventh year,</p>
<p>It was Reorganized into a University. It had a College of Arts and Sciences and a College of Social Sciences. In June of the nineteenth year, it was approved for registration by the Ministry of Education. During the January 28th Incident, the school buildings and equipment were completely destroyed by the Japanese army. In March of the twenty-second year, although temporary school buildings were rented and classes were reopened, the school's vitality had been damaged, and its financial situation had deteriorated. This resulted in a school with thirty years of revolutionary history repeatedly facing collapse. Last spring, after Mayor Wu took over as president, he made grand plans and was determined to revive the school. However, due to being too busy with official duties, he was unable to devote his full efforts to the school. He intended to find talented individuals to assist in governance, in order to enrich the content and improve efficiency, hence the proposal to add a vice president. At the same time, Cai Yuanpei, chairman of the school board, believed that the revival of China Public School required someone with proven experience in running schools to be in charge of internal affairs. With the consent of Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, and other directors, on February 2nd,</p>
<p>A Board of Directors Meeting was Held. Six people attended, including Cai Yuanpei, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaiyuan, Yu Youren, Wang Yunwu, and Zhu Yingpeng. They unanimously decided to appoint Chen Jicheng, a professor at the school, as vice president. The reporter learned of this and visited Chen. Chen initially expressed humility, saying that although he had been engaged in education for many years and had taught at universities such as Shanghai University, he did not have much experience in university administration. Moreover, China Public School was a school with a history, so he did not dare to act rashly. The reporter asked that if the board of directors insisted on recruiting him, how should he begin. Chen said that if he could not refuse, he would only be able to temporarily maintain the school, while enhancing its content, constructing school buildings, and gradually developing it, so as to achieve the goal of revival.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Qiaoguang Middle School Affairs</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of Qiaoguang Middle School last semester, school affairs have greatly improved. Principal Qiu Hanping is enthusiastic and responsible, raising funds at his own expense, and showing no reluctance despite the large amount. The faculty and staff are also dedicated and understanding of the school authorities' difficulties. Therefore, the development of school affairs is progressing rapidly. The latest school affairs are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Re-election of School Board: Some members of the school board have resigned due to leaving Shanghai for personal reasons, while others have completed their terms. Therefore, the school board held a meeting the other day and specially re-elected Zhang Shouyong, Ding Chaowu, Lin Kanghou, Li Dachao, Hu Wenhu, Hu Guigeng, Jiang Yiping, Wu Jingxiong, and Liu Shifang as school board members, joining the original school board members Dai Kuisheng, Qiu Hanping, Yu Youren, Wu Xingya, Ma Canhan, and Chen Wuna, for a total of fifteen members.</p>
<p>Strict Enrollment: The enrollment this time is quite strict. Those with incomplete academic records are not allowed to register. Once applicants are admitted, the school will be responsible for reporting them to ensure that their academic records can be filed and that no problems will arise upon graduation.</p>
<p>Addition of New Classes: There are currently ten grades in junior and senior high school, all starting in the autumn. Recently, due to requests from new students, spring semester classes have been added to facilitate enrollment. A first-year spring semester class in the general academic and business tracks of senior high school has been added, with entrance examinations scheduled for the 15th of this month, limited to thirty students per class.</p>
<p>Free Scholarships: To reward students who are poor but eager to learn, scholarships have been established. These scholarships are donated by enthusiastic educators from all walks of life, and there are many slots available. The school has established regulations for free students and work-study students. Students with excellent academic performance can apply according to the regulations. Additionally, new students who achieve a perfect score on the entrance examination will also receive a 50% tuition reduction.</p>
<p>Promoting Thrift: The school promotes thrift and discourages extravagance. All students wear uniforms to save money, especially for overseas Chinese students. The school has contacted the parents of overseas Chinese students to manage their expenses on behalf of the family to prevent waste.</p>
<p>Enriching Facilities: The various facilities are somewhat complete in scale, but not yet fully equipped. Currently, the school is adding physics and chemistry equipment and books, and all kinds of equipment should be available soon.</p>
<p>Increasing Courses: The school strives to improve students' academic level. In addition to the courses promulgated by the Ministry of Education, various necessary courses are added to meet the needs of the Nanyang community. Specialized teachers are hired to teach these courses.</p>
<p>Emphasizing Self-Study: In the past, self-study was only emphasized for boarding students, and guidance was not provided to day students. Therefore, the academic progress of some students was slow. Now, in addition to stipulating self-study time for boarding students, the school has also established self-study measures to ensure that day students also benefit. During self-study, teachers and staff will provide detailed supervision and guidance.</p>
<p>Implementing Military Training: Starting this semester, military training will be implemented. The school has contacted the Shanghai Municipal National Military Training Committee and hired Instructor Hou Guansan as the military training instructor. Military training will be conducted for more than six hours per week.</p>
<p>Hiring Full-Time Teachers: All teachers hired this semester, with the exception of one or two part-time teachers, are full-time teachers. Their salaries have been increased, and they all live on campus to live with the students and improve teaching efficiency.</p>
<p>Adding an Auditorium: Although the school's buildings are very elegant, a large auditorium is still lacking. A temporary auditorium is planned to be added for gatherings of all students. Construction is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>Establishing a Cooperative: The school's teachers and students have jointly organized a consumer cooperative, both to promote cooperation and to provide business students with practical experience. All supplies for the school's teachers and students are provided by the cooperative.</p>
<h3>New Initiatives at Jianguo Middle School</h3>
<p>Since the thorough internal reorganization of Jianguo Middle School in Zhabei, this city, last semester, it has implemented a strict management and strict examination plan, which is earnestly implemented by the teaching affairs and student affairs departments, as well as class advisors, through a joint teaching and guidance committee. Over the past semester, it has been quite effective. In this semester, in addition to continuing the previous policies, it will also devote all its efforts to improving students' academic level and enriching their daily lives. Regarding the former, the teaching affairs office has carefully formulated a teaching schedule for each subject, requiring students to submit study reports within a limited time after completing each stage, which are carefully reviewed by the teaching affairs office in conjunction with the chief teachers of each subject, with improvement points suggested at any time. It is also stipulated that an academic lecture will be held every week to supplement the deficiencies of each subject's curriculum. Regarding the latter, it has been decided that Saturday afternoons will be rotated between work days and entertainment days. On work days, the principal will lead all students, faculty, and staff to engage in cleaning, repairing, clearing, rebuilding, and painting work inside and outside the school, as well as the school buildings and equipment, in order to cultivate students' habit of loving labor. On entertainment days, the entire school's faculty and students will gather to hold social gatherings or outings, in order to rationalize life and entertainment.

<p>Talking with my sisters, I said, "I also want to go to Jincheng to see a play." One of my sisters dragged me and pulled me into the crowded car. At the ticket booth, it was decided that I was a freeloader on a poet from afar.</p>
<p>First, I went to the dressing room with a few sisters and was surprised that this time it was a grand gathering of big stars and famous stage actors. Before even seeing the play, I already knew that this performance would be a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>As the curtain rose, the magnificent three-dimensional stage revealed the interior of a photography studio. At first glance, the volunteer extras in this one-act play "Under the Arc Light" seemed uninspired, not passionately discussing resistance against Japan but lightly chatting about love affairs. However, the more I watched, the more I understood that the core of the plot was not about romance but about speaking up for the extras, using love affairs as a backdrop. It sharply and meticulously satirized the real life of a photography studio.</p>
<p>The script of "Under the Arc Light" is a landmark progressive work since the author began writing scripts, and it is the first perfect satirical play since the beginning of Chinese spoken drama.</p>
<p>Moreover, Yuan Muzhi's calm and excellent performance, Wan Laitian's tense and lively performance, Hu Ping's portrayal of a pretentious female star, and the efforts of the entire cast of famous actors made the entire performance a great success.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli's saccharine love talk was a bit too exaggerated and lacked authenticity.</p>
<p>"Song of Rejuvenation" takes love as the warp and resistance against Japan as the weft. The author used skillful techniques and powerful recitations to incorporate profound meaning into the humorous, creating this three-act play with sound, color, laughter, and tears.</p>
<p>The first act is set against the backdrop of the Red River in Southeast Asia. The coconut groves, reeds, bright green light, and interlaced shadows, along with the beautiful and magnificent lighting and scenery, broke the record for Shanghai drama without a stage!</p>
<p>Gao Weihan (played by Jin Yan) is the most active of the three passionate young teachers in Southeast Asia. Mei Niang, a student from Southeast Asia, passionately loves him. One day, he meets his good friend Hong Sixun and girlfriend Huang Biru by the river. Weihan is unhappy, playing the piano melancholically and singing, "Goodbye, Southeast Asia!" He is about to leave his beloved Mei Niang and return to China to reclaim the lost territory of the Northeast.</p>
<p>Mei Niang also comes to the riverside and hears Weihan mocking her for being engaged to San Shui. She jumps and laughs madly because she only loves Weihan. Unfortunately, Mei Niang's father's business failed, and he sold Mei Niang to the son of a wealthy businessman, San Shui. At this moment, she hears that her lover is returning to China and is mocked by her lover for being engaged, so she laughs with tears in her eyes like a madwoman.</p>
<p>Wang Renmei's performance in this section is the most powerful, capturing the audience's soul. She uses her original enthusiasm, strength, and excitement to depict Mei Niang as a wild rose from the South. Her clear singing is also melancholic and moving. She is a "powerful" actress.</p>
<p>The second act is in a wounded soldier hospital. The battles of January 28th destroyed the bodies of many passionate warriors. They lie in bed, wailing and screaming. However, the war for resistance did not destroy their hearts. Even though they are severely injured and unable to move, they still shout, "Send me to the front line!" and cry, "I would rather die on the battlefield than in the hospital!"</p>
<p>"Kill, advance!" Gao Weihan is carried out of the operating room, screaming miserably, and the plot suddenly becomes tense. When Hong Sixun (played by Zhao Dan) struggles to get out of bed to caress Weihan, the sad and moving scene, the tragic and miserable performance, both the script and the performance are so good that they are tear-jerking, and it is the climax of the entire play, the essence of tragedy and grandeur. Zhao Dan's acting skills are so delicate in understanding the tragic life and full of passionate emotions, making him the most promising talented actor.</p>
<p>The third act is the third anniversary of the January 28th Incident and the eve of the Lunar New Year. Hong Sixun, Huang Biru, Gao Weihan, and Mei Niang are all at the home of Hu Huasheng (played by Yuan Muzhi), an overseas Chinese who returned from Southeast Asia. Gao Weihan is still an idiot who can only shout, "Kill, advance!" Jin Yan plays the idiot very well. Mei Niang is very sad about this unconscious and memoryless idiot. She sings songs to him sadly, trying to restore his memory and make him recognize that she is his beloved Mei Niang, but his only answer is, "Kill, advance!" This ruthless bullet gave their love a tragedy, truly breaking the heart of the affectionate Mei Niang! 丨丨 Wang Renmei did not fully express the pain of heartbreak 丨丨 making the audience laugh and cry, which is the author's wonderful use of profound meaning in humor!</p>
<p>Suddenly, firecrackers are heard, and Weihan seems to have regained consciousness. Amidst the enthusiastic calls and temptations of his friends and loved ones, he awakens. How happy should Mei Hong and others be at this time? With wild joy, come a burst of laughter, kissing him, hugging him? It is a pity that this point is lacking. Zhao Dan, Renmei, and Wang Ying calmly look at him and say some plain things from the past, reducing a climax in the plot, and only when Mrs. Hu appears there is monotonous laughter, what a pity!</p>
<p>Apart from this, this script is satisfactory. The following are some points that seem to need discussion: 丨丨 Will a three-year-old idiot suddenly wake up? Having just awakened, can he bravely and passionately fight with his love rival again? Since he has been an idiot for three years, at least his body should be dull and inflexible, right? Will he still be so lively in fighting San Shui, scaring San Shui into fleeing in embarrassment, making it a humorous and joyful ending?</p>
<p>I hope that young people will treat this play as a good medicine for treating numbness, and not lightly regard it as mere humor!</p>
<p>Back to the topic: 丨丨 This public performance, being able to use songs, beautiful scenery, and artistic lighting, is a progress from the drama performances around the September 18th Incident, which only used rigid and dull scripts, gray cloth backgrounds, and dim lighting. This time, the script has such skillful techniques, humorous jokes, and beautiful songs. The transformation and success of the script can be considered to have broken the first record; the cooperation of many big stars and famous stage actors in the excellent performance can be considered to have broken the second record; the beauty of the lighting and the grandeur and exquisiteness of the scenery have broken the third record! There is also the coordination of music, which is both good to look at and good to listen to, which can be said to be "opening the beauty of sound and color and starting the enjoyment of vision and hearing" in spoken drama.</p>
<p>Compared with the drama performances at the Tsukiji Little Theater in Japan ten years ago, it is even better.</p>
<h3>Talking about "Zhong Bojing"</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Ever since a "Beijing School"? A writer talked about "The Origin and Development of Chinese New Literature," believing that the New Literature Movement since the May Fourth Movement was inherited from the literary movements of the Public Security School and the Jingling School at the end of the Ming Dynasty, the Public Security School and the Jingling School have been in constant discussion in the literary world. Especially Yuan Zhonglang, one of the Three Yuan Brothers of the Public Security School, you talk about him, I talk about him; you print Yuan Zhonglang's collection, I print it too; if he has a spirit underground, Yuan Zhonglang should really laugh!</p>
<p>To be honest, among the literati of the Ming Dynasty, I admire Li Zhuowu the most. Yuan Zhonglang of the Public Security School and Zhong Bojing of the Jingling School are both insignificant. However, Zhong Bojing's behavior is not as contrived as Yuan Zhonglang's, and he seems to have some authenticity. For example, when he was the Deputy Commissioner of Education in Fujian, he openly sold favors. He wanted to take his concubine to Wuyi Mountain, but he happened to have to leave his post to mourn his father, so he still took his concubine to the mountain before leaving. In an era when hypocrites and false moralists held power, no one would dare to show this kind of behavior, but he dared to show it. Perhaps he was influenced by Li Zhuowu, which is also possible. Li Zhuowu encountered the impeachment of Zhang Wenda, a censor of the Ministry of Rites, and he also encountered the impeachment of Nan Juyi, the governor of Fujian. The memorial said:</p>
<p>Breaking the rules in every way, sweeping aside the Five Classics. Turning students into money trees, the peaches and plums should be ashamed; promoting brokers to high positions, the gates and walls become a market. Openly abandoning morality and disregarding it, even celebrating while mourning the death of a parent. Suspected of being mentally ill and insane, not just a literary man without morals.</p>
<p>It can be seen that Zhong Bojing, like Li Zhuowu, opposed Confucian ethics. However, Zhong Bojing never wrote books or taught, so the people did not suffer the tragic disaster of burning books and humiliation.</p>
<p>After Li Zhuowu's death, Yuan Hongdao wrote a biography of Li Wenling, praising him greatly. Naturally, the Public Security School, which opposed archaism in literature, wanted to praise Li Zhuowu, who opposed archaism in thought. Li Zhuowu was also a person who liked to comment on novels. As a member of the Jingling School, Zhong Bojing also edited and criticized many novels. He and Li Zhuowu can be called novel commentators. The "Pangu Zhi Zhuan" in two volumes and fourteen sections, and the "Xia Zhi Zhuan" in four volumes and nineteen sections, are both titled "Edited by Zhong Xing Bojing, Father of Jingling," and have prefaces by Zhong Xing at the beginning. The National Archives of Japan has a Ming Dynasty edition. There is also the "Shang Zhi Zhuan" in four volumes and twelve sections, and the "Xia Shang He Zhuan" edition from the Ji Gu Tang during the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, which is also titled "Edited by Zhong Xing Bojing, Father." The "Kai Pi Yan Yi Tong Su Zhi Zhuan" in six volumes and eighty chapters, written by Zhou You of the Ming Dynasty, has a Qing Dynasty reprint, and the cover is also titled "Commented by Mr. Zhong Bojing." Other novels said to be criticized by Zhong Bojing include the "Han Dynasty Interpretations," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Investiture of the Gods," and "Water Margin." We should know that Zhong Bojing was an important figure in the anti-archaism faction at that time, and it may be true that he criticized the novels that the archaism faction looked down on.</p>
<p>In short, Zhong Bojing had a somewhat anti-Confucian attitude as a person and a somewhat anti-archaistic tendency as a writer. My talking about him today does not want to explain any connection between him and the modern New Literature Movement, fabricating a literary tradition, you praise Yuan Zhonglang, and you are considered the Public Security School; I talk about Zhong Bojing, and you are considered the Jingling School.</p>
<h3>A Travelogue of Luokou (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>(Snowy Wilderness)</p>
<p>The snow had not yet melted, so we took advantage of the sunny weather to take a trip to the outskirts of Luokou.</p>
<p>Luokou is on the bank of the Yellow River: the Yellow River Railway Bridge, one of the great projects in the world, is also there.</p>
<p>It is about twelve miles from Jinan City. The fields along the way are covered with thick white snow, and the paths and ditches cannot be distinguished at all. If it were not for the brown poplars that had lost their leaves and the yellow earthen walls of some houses dotting the nearby area, one would almost suspect that they had reached places like the Arctic. There is not a single cloud in the sky, it is all azure blue, and even deeper in color than the sky in Jiangnan. The sun shines on the boundless snowfield, and the white light dazzles the eyes, making people dare not look directly. However, the sunshine is not warm, and the fingers and toes of those sitting in the car are numb with pain. Two or three crows dare not fly in the air, but huddle tightly with their wings and rest beside the road. When a car comes, they fly two or three feet high, slightly dodging, and after the car has passed, they fall silently again.</p>
<p>A freight car pulled by three horses rumbled along the icy road. The uneven slope lifted people up from the cargo and then dropped them down again. The black manes of the horses were covered with frost and turned mottled white, and white powder-like things splashed up under their feet as they ran. In the distant, bright white wilderness, a black spot gradually grew larger, slowly wriggling. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a carriage-style car pulled by a horse, with black cotton cloth walls and a glass window. 丨 This must be a wealthy landlord going there to visit relatives, we thought.</p>
<p>In front of the roadside shop, steaming buns and pot stickers were placed, and the owner poked his head out, wearing a furry ear hat, and greeted the passers-by before shrinking back in. Without the surrounding snowy wilderness, just looking at these things, one would feel that the atmosphere of the North Country is extremely strong. Sitting around the stove in the house and watching the icicles under the eaves did not give much different feeling, but after seeing the snowy wilderness, one deeply felt that they were in the North.</p>
<h3>Silver Ding</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>The Silver Ding Taoist who knocked on the wooden fish every morning had been dead for many years. First, Silver Ding worked as a school janitor at a small school we used to study at.</p>
<p>Let's write a special feature about him 丨</p>
<p>A dark black face, thick eyebrows, high nose, that face contained a strong and fierce temperament, when I think of his face, it looks like a grumpy military officer.</p>
<p>Since I studied at that small school in my hometown since I was little, I also became familiar with Silver Ding.</p>
<p>He was stubborn and unreasonable. We had hardly ever seen him give a gentle smile. Except for not resisting the principal and teachers in the school, he always maintained his bad temper, and his life was always absurd and unscrupulous; on school holidays, he usually spent his energy gambling all day long. For the sake of gambling, fighting and causing trouble with his partners, breaking their heads was commonplace, and his companions were a little surprised by him.</p>
<p>Apart from gambling, he also loved drinking and stealing women. He was never absent from any unrestrained behavior. His own children were ten years old and had gone to work as apprentices in shops, but he still stole women tightly. Because of that energy, he fought with his old wife almost every night; his methods were extraordinarily fierce and ruthless. His wife was beaten by him and was covered in injuries countless times.</p>
<p>Silver Ding's money was wasted so lavishly.</p>
<p>Later, he became poor! People were also tired and sick.</p>
<p>After being sick, one day, he suddenly told the principal that he was willing to leave. This time it was really strange. As soon as he left the school, he abandoned his wife and children, and he seemed to have completely changed his appearance. He grew his hair long and went to work as a temple keeper in a temple south of the town.</p>
<p>Silver Ding has really completely changed!</p>
<p>From then on, his shadow was no longer seen in the gambling dens or wine shops in the town.</p>
<p>After a year, someone told me that Silver Ding had become a Taoist in the temple, living in the temple all day long, sitting quietly, chanting scriptures; eating vegetarian food, wearing cloth clothes, and practicing asceticism. Moreover, he had become peaceful and amicable, and did not interact with anyone.</p>
<p>It is said that once, an enemy from his former gambling den went to slap him twice in the face. His face turned red from the slap, but he smiled and did not fight back.</p>
<p>Another time, several naughty children spat saliva on him, but he did not move, wiping the saliva off himself.</p>
<p>Silver Ding's character suddenly changed to such goodness, even not resisting evil. This matter was really surprising.</p>
<p>He must have repented!</p>
<p>After another three years, he knocked on the wooden fish in the street every morning. In the faint morning light, wearing a black Taoist robe, with a jade hairpin holding up his coiled hair, carrying a large wooden fish on his neck, with the Buddha on his back, burning incense, his attire was so ancient. Regardless of rainy days, snowy days, or hot summer days; for two and a half years, he never interrupted, beating the wooden fish; that eternal good spirit, the piety of a fool, was admired by everyone in the town.</p>
<p>Until the end of his life, he did not change his appearance; when he died, he wore this ancient costume, holding a tablet, and took his repentant heart with him.</p>
<p>Silver Ding's wooden fish sound has been gone for many years, and the world has undergone countless changes during that period. This foolish and pious person, no one in his hometown talks about him anymore.</p>
<p>December 9, 1934, at Puzhuang.</p>
<h3>The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County (4)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Mark Twain, Li Bo</p>
<p>The man took the box again, and took a long, particular look. He handed it back to Smiley, and said, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog."</p>
<p>"Maybe you don't," Smiley says. "Maybe you understand frogs, and maybe you don't understand 'em; maybe you've had experience, and maybe you ain't only a amature. Anyways, I've got my opinion, and I'll resk forty dollars that he can outjump any frog in Calaveras County."</p>
<p>And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad and troubled, "But I'm only a stranger here, and I ain't got no frog; but if I had a frog, I'd bet you."</p>
<p>And then Smiley says, "That's all right--that's all right--if you'll hold my box a minute, I'll go and ketch you a frog." And so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with Smiley's, and set down to wait.</p>
<p>So he set there a good while, thinking and thinking to himself; and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot--filled him pretty near up to his chin--and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller, and says:</p>
<p>"Now, if you're ready, set him alongside of Dan'l, with his fore-paws just even with Dan'l, and I'll give the word." Then he says, "One--two--three--jump!" and him and the feller touched up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan'l give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders--so--like a Frenchman, but it warn't no use--he couldn't budge; he was planted as solid as a church, and he couldn't no more stir than if he was anchored out. Smiley was dreadfully disgusted, and he didn't know what to make of it. He was the maddest man--he was the maddest man. Naturally, he didn't know what to make of it.</p>
<p>The feller took the money and started away; and when he was going out at the door, he jerked his thumb over his shoulder--so--at Dan'l, and says again, very deliberate, "Well," he says, "I don't see no p'ints about that frog that's any better'n any other frog."</p>
<p>Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan'l a long time, and at last he says, "I do wonder what in the nation that frog throw'd off for--I wonder if there ain't something the matter with him--he 'pears to look might baggy, somehow." And he ketched Dan'l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up and says, "Why, blame my cats, if he don't weigh five pound!" And turned him upside down and he belched out a double handful of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest man--he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he never ketched him. And——</p>
<p>(Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front yard, and got up to see what was wanted.) And busting in just as I was feeling comfortable and resting so, I asked him to let me stay there and rest me, which it wasn't a minute but what he was back again.</p>
<p>But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the adventures of the enterprising vagabond Gimme Smiley would furnish me with any information concerning the Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, and so I started away.</p>
<p>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed me and recommenced:</p>
<p>"Well, there was a feller here once by the name of Jim Smiley, in the winter of '49 or maybe it was the spring of '50, I do not recollect exactly, somehow, though what makes me remember more particular about it is, that he never smiled, he never did, if you recall——"</p>
<p>But there being no time, and no disposition to listen to the story of the afflicted cow, I bade him good-bye. (End)</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3>How Should Industry and Commerce Cope?</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the unease in the Shanghai business community has gradually become impossible to conceal, increasingly exposed. When the accounts were settled last year, the reserves accumulated internally but not yet visible externally burst forth like a festering sore, becoming difficult to control. Banks collapsed, money shops underwent liquidation, banknotes were subject to runs, private bank notes depreciated, stores closed down, factories ceased operations, "local immortals" fled, and wealthy merchants furrowed their brows. Consequently, rumors spread and gossip proliferated, creating a precarious and turbulent situation. The difficulty of enduring the "double year-end ordeal" was indeed unmatched in the past year.</p>
<p>Difficult, difficult, yet this "year-end ordeal" has been safely navigated. Past events cannot be retrieved, but future actions are still possible. "Plant beans and get beans, plant melons and get melons." Today's consequences must have a cause in the past. By examining the consequences to seek the cause, and by understanding the cause to obtain the desired outcome, the origins of success, failure, profit, and loss can be contemplated more than halfway. We need not dwell on past regrets, nor need we speculate about the future. Let us focus on the matter at hand. Regarding future endeavors, it is deeply hoped that everyone will draw upon their experience, learn from past failures, and establish a direction for revival. As the saying goes, "The plan for the day is in the morning, the plan for the year is in the spring." If action is not taken now, it will be too late to regret. If the initial plan is flawed, it will ultimately lead to misfortune.</p>
<p>Learning from past failures, the financial sector will inevitably adopt more stringent measures—a necessary trend. However, this is certainly not a blessing for all industries, nor is it beneficial to the financial sector itself. As imports of foreign goods remain unabated and the outflow of silver cannot be curbed, funds will become increasingly scarce and turnover sluggish. Consequently, prices will fall, and industry and commerce will weaken—an inevitable outcome. To safeguard themselves, financial institutions will exercise caution when issuing loans. If they do lend, they will likely favor collateral to minimize losses—a justifiable defense. However, it is unknown that the tighter the credit, the lower the prices, and the more sluggish the various industries. Industry and commerce need at least three sets of capital: one set for sales, one set awaiting sale, and one set in production or transit. Now, due to the cautious lending of the financial sector, attempting to operate a business with only one set of capital will clearly lead to insufficient turnover. This will create a situation where industry and commerce have no way to develop, agricultural products become even less valuable, stagnation and paralysis set in, and everyone is "dried up and impoverished." "Dried up and impoverished" is the most dangerous form of poverty, where everything is "sold out and used up." What benefit will the financial sector derive from this?</p>
<p>The financial sector's predicament is due more to its exposure to real estate than to industry and commerce. Commercial banks, clearly, should focus on lending to industry and commerce. However, in recent years, many have seen the profitability of real estate, believing that Shanghai would only prosper and never decline, especially in real estate, which was considered safe and secure. Consequently, they were swayed by the words of real estate brokers, accepted their mortgage loans, even established real estate departments to specialize in this area, and invested heavily. When industry and commerce faltered, houses became vacant, rents were in arrears, and the real estate market had sellers but no buyers. Attempts to sell were fruitless, attempts to mortgage were unsuccessful, and attempts to recover loans were met with non-compliance. As a result, turnover became difficult, and the banks were bloated and suffocated, causing the market to suffer. The real estate market, after this setback, is expected to see prices fall and valuations decrease until they reach a level that maintains the bare minimum profit. Rents will also be reduced to a level that is generally affordable, and vacant houses will be occupied. Those engaged in real estate will realize that buying today and selling tomorrow, artificially inflating prices, and deliberately manipulating the market are not viable strategies. They will awaken, repent, and engage in normal buying and selling. The financial sector will also realize that real estate is not the best investment and will change course, focusing on developing its proper business responsibilities. Then, today's difficulties may be seen as a turning point, a sign of revival in the future. However, this is not something that can be expected in the immediate future.</p>
<p>Some say that the financial sector cannot provide low-interest loans to industry and commerce because deposit rates are too high. This is true. However, high deposit rates are not the result of depositor demands but are set automatically by the financial sector. The financial sector raises deposit rates to absorb small, scattered deposits, aiming to encompass everything and facilitate its speculative ventures in real estate and government bonds, as well as its business operations. With expensive deposit rates, lending rates are naturally high. Industry and commerce, already burdened with high borrowing costs, also face a bleak market. How can they avoid losses? They may even be willing to pay high interest rates but still cannot obtain loans, indicating that the shortage of funds has reached a critical point. Even general deposit interest rates must be high. Consequently, there are proposals to reduce deposit interest rates, believing that only in this way can low-interest loans be provided to industry and commerce, and only in this way can the wealthy be prevented from hoarding money in banks and instead disperse it to rural areas. Regardless of whether high interest rates are a natural trend, it is still doubtful whether the wealthy would be willing to invest their money in rural areas under such circumstances. For example, when the deposit interest rates of Chinese banks are reduced to the same level as foreign banks, large depositors, seeing no profit to be made, still deposit their money in foreign banks. Therefore, the financial sector can only reduce the interest rates for small, scattered deposits, which foreign banks are unwilling to accept. This only earns them a reputation for exploitation and does not solve the problem. When they want to attract deposits, they say how generous the interest rates are. But once the deposits are in their vaults, they want to reduce the deposit rates. Although this behavior may not be as blatant as "card trick," it certainly undermines their credibility. Therefore, there is a natural way to level interest rates. Unfortunately, our people only know how to build dams to prevent floods and cannot trace the source of the problem to its root. If the financial sector had a strong and powerful organization, capable of taking on the responsibility of regulation, then deposit rates of 3% or 4% would certainly be feasible. However, there is no one in the financial sector who can take on this responsibility, and the high interest rates on bonds are a reality. Therefore, without offering high interest rates, they cannot attract deposits; without deposits, they cannot facilitate their activities. And to cope with these deposit interest payments, they must engage in profitable businesses, such as real estate, government bonds, speculation in bullion, yarn, flour, and wheat, which become the objectives of general banks, creating a deep crisis.</p>
<p>Now that the precarious situation of the financial industry has become clear and the news of real estate price declines is prevalent, where will the wealthy go? This is also a point worth noting. Will they use their money to invest in industry and commerce? This would certainly be a blessing for industry and commerce, but it is feared that this will not happen. Will they disperse it to rural areas? As mentioned earlier, some may be unwilling. So, how will they cope? I dare to say that they will use it for speculation. Since the second half of last year, those in the financial sector who held bonds sold them when the price rose. Therefore, most of the current bonds are held by "retail investors." These so-called "retail investors" are depositors in the financial industry who have accumulated some money. They calculate that instead of earning a 3% or 4% interest rate on demand deposits, it is better to buy some bonds on the stock exchange to speculate and earn interest. This was the case last year, and it is feared that it will be even worse this year. Therefore, it is difficult to see how bank deposit rates will not remain high.</p>
<p>These words are not just empty talk. Last year, most industries suffered losses, but all the exchanges had surpluses. Some shares with a par value of 20 yuan distributed a dividend of 8 yuan in the second half of the year, totaling 14.5 yuan for both halves of the year, almost a 100% profit. Others, with a par value of 25 yuan, distributed a dividend of 5 yuan, and those with a par value of 15 yuan distributed 1 yuan (all referring to a half-year period). Some employees received bonuses of up to 3.5 yuan. The exchanges were booming, while industry and commerce were collapsing one after another, creating a stark contrast between prosperity and decline. However, this is the true nature of the Shanghai market, so what is there to be surprised about?</p>
<p>How should industry and commerce cope in the future? This is up to industry and commerce to take care of themselves. Outsiders cannot solve this problem with irrelevant and painless talk. However, the way out for the financial sector is still to sincerely seek cooperation with industry and commerce, help them operate, and supplement their shortcomings, not to see passive contraction as the solution. Industry and commerce should abandon their attitude of blaming heaven and others and not working hard themselves. They should try their best to correct their internal defects and seek a way out. If they rely on luck and boast about their abilities, their failure is imminent. All sectors, especially those with responsibilities, should at this time refrain from extravagance, practice frugality, buy fewer foreign goods, and use more domestic products to reduce the adverse trade balance and slightly stem the outflow of currency. The authorities should plan comprehensively, revive the countryside, support industry and commerce, and establish policies that are in line with the national economy and the people's livelihood, without merely copying others. Only by adhering to the facts, working together, enduring hardships, and seeking a way out of difficulties can a turnaround be achieved.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Recent Fluctuations in Shanghai Interbank Lending Rates</h3>
<p>— Feng Weiqi</p>
<p>The foreign exchange rate and silver interbank lending rate have always been the barometer for financial observers. Since the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, with a fixed foreign exchange rate (which in reality no longer exists), and the change of the silver interbank lending rate to the foreign exchange interbank lending rate, this barometer has had to be changed to the foreign exchange interbank lending rate. Although new-style banks have sprung up in recent years and the influence of money shops has gradually waned, the rates quoted by the money industry market have gradually become unable to represent the state of the entire financial market. However, due to historical and customary reasons, the former's clearing of bills is still far less than the latter's, with its clearing volume only reaching one-fifth of the latter's. Therefore, most industrial and commercial circles and Chinese banks still use the interbank lending rate set by the Money Industry Association market as the standard. Therefore, the changes in this interbank lending rate still have considerable significance for China's entire financial economy.</p>
<p>In the past, under normal circumstances, the rise and fall of the interbank lending rate, apart from special circumstances of political turmoil, mostly indicated the development of domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce. Because the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce requires a large amount of capital, and there is a lot of interbank lending. Under the law of supply and demand of funds, the interbank lending rate will also rise accordingly, and vice versa. That is, it changes in direct proportion. This phenomenon is especially evident in agriculture. Because agriculture is seasonal, whenever agricultural products enter the market (such as silk, tea, and wheat in April, May, and June, and the autumn harvest in August, September, and October), the capital in the cities must flow into the countryside in large quantities to purchase agricultural products, dispersing into the hands of farmers, causing the capital in the cities to suddenly decrease sharply, and funds to become tight, leading to a rise in the interbank lending rate. Although the agricultural products purchased by the funds exported from the city are not necessarily all retained in the city as non-productive consumption, sooner or later, they must be re-exported to various places or overseas, or made into industrial products and re-imported into the countryside. Similarly, the cash obtained by farmers from selling agricultural products is not necessarily all stored up, sooner or later, they must also be used to purchase various industrial daily necessities (although not directly). This means that the urban funds that flow out will eventually flow back. However, in the process of this outflow and inflow, the speed is different, that is, the outflow is fast, and the inflow is slow. Thus, reflected in urban finance, it becomes a so-called financial season. However, in the past, this urban financial season that adapted to the agricultural season, since the world economic panic spread to China and China's semi-colonial long-term chronic panic merged, and the current unprecedented economic crisis broke out, the countryside has become more depressed than before, agricultural product exports have plummeted, and industrial product imports into the countryside have grown day by day, farmers cannot make ends meet, cash flows out in one direction, and there is very little opportunity for it to flow back to the countryside. At the same time, due to the dumping of foreign goods and the weakness of rural purchasing power, general industry and commerce have also shown extreme depression, causing the cash concentrated in the cities to have no way out and to flock to speculative businesses such as gold speculation, real estate, and government bonds. Therefore, in recent years, the interbank lending rate in Shanghai, except for the recent months that will be specifically discussed in this article, has generally been in a low state. Just look at the table below to know.</p>
<p>Monthly Average Table of Shanghai Interbank Lending Rate in the Last Four Years</p>
<p>January February March April May June July August September October November December</p>
<p>1931 13 1 2 2 4 5 7 11 18 33 37 28</p>
<p>1932 13 35 19 13 6 7 9 7 4 4 4 2</p>
<p>1933 2 1 4 4 5 7 5 6 7 8 8 9</p>
<p>1934 5 1 3 4 7 7 5 9 12 7 19</p>
<p>In the above table, the reason why the interbank lending rate from September 1931 to April 1932 was relatively high was due to the September 18th Incident in Northeast China and the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. The reason why it was slightly higher from October to December 1933 was because the Fujian Incident was launched at this time. Therefore, it is more appropriate to say that this slightly higher phenomenon is due to political reasons rather than economic reasons. However, in recent months, that is, from August in the second half of last year, it has risen slightly, and then suddenly rose to nearly the top of the plate at six jiao on December 28th and 30th, and recently it has shrunk back to within one jiao. What is the reason for this? Everyone knows that there have been no major political changes during this period. At the same time, economically, such as agriculture, because more than a dozen provinces and regions across the country suffered unprecedented drought and floods in June and July last year, the total value of agricultural losses was more than 10 million, and the harvest volume was only 50% to 60% of the full year. In addition to industrial raw materials, even food self-sufficiency was insufficient. Where did the surplus come from for large-scale exports? Therefore, throughout last year, the movement of cash between Shanghai and the interior, except for the last two months, which had special significance, Shanghai has always been in a position of surplus (see the Shanghai cash movement table below). As for general industry and commerce, it has also become more depressed than before due to the intensified dumping of foreign goods and the reduction of rural purchasing power. According to incomplete records in the newspapers, in just one and a half months from December last year to January 15th this year, there have been more than 60 banks, money shops, factories, and stores that have gone bankrupt in Shanghai. From this, it can be seen that the rise and fall of the interbank lending rate in Shanghai in recent months is neither a political influence nor a development of agriculture, industry, and commerce. So what is the reason? To answer this question, we must not say, as most people say, that this is an inevitable phenomenon during the year-end settlement period and has nothing to do with the silver problem. Why? Because the year-end settlement period can only explain the reason for the sudden rise to six jiao on the 28th and 30th, but it cannot explain the reason why it has been trending upward for the previous three or four months. Moreover, the settlement period, except for some new-style banks and companies, is generally at the end of January of this year. In recent days, it is precisely the settlement period that most people follow, but the interbank lending rate has not only not seen a rise, but has fallen to within one jiao. From this, it can be seen that the actual reason is definitely not here. The fact is exactly the opposite of what most people say, that is, the upward fluctuation of the Shanghai interbank lending rate in recent months is precisely because of the silver problem. If you don't believe me, please look at the Shanghai silver movement table for the past year below.</p>

<p>From the above table, it can be seen that in the 11 months of last year, the cash transferred from various domestic places to Shanghai and the cash transferred from Shanghai to various domestic places were all in surplus every month except for the last two months, which had special significance. If there was no silver problem to transfer it to foreign countries in large quantities, the Shanghai interbank lending rate would undoubtedly fall sharply due to the ample funds. That's right, the government also issued an order in September last year to levy silver export tax and balance tax nationwide in order to prevent the large outflow of silver; but first, this order was a bit too late, because before the tax was levied, the silver flowing to foreign countries from January to mid-September was already considerable, in other words, the silver in domestic and Shanghai deposits had been greatly reduced at this time; second, after the implementation of the tax, the balance tax was estimated too low, and it was still profitable to transport the taxed silver, so the result was that the outflow of silver did not stop; third, because China's coastline is too long, and it is restricted by various unequal treaties, smuggling and private transportation exports cannot be prohibited; fourth, because the smuggling methods of unscrupulous merchants are clever, first transporting silver from Shanghai to the interior, and then secretly transferring it to foreign countries, such as the large inflow of silver from Shanghai to the interior in October and November in the above table. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the interbank lending rate is trending upward.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there is a minor reason, that is, the rumors that arose in the process of the government dealing with the silver problem, such as saying that the government would concentrate cash, reduce the value of the currency, and implement inflation. Because these rumors are enough to scare the general silver holders, and they will store cash, reducing the amount of cash circulating in the market, and promoting the rise of the interbank lending rate.</p>
<p>Above, we have attributed the reason for the upward fluctuation of the Shanghai interbank lending rate in recent months to the silver problem. So why has the interbank lending rate suddenly trended downward and returned to within one jiao when the silver problem has not been resolved? Regarding this point, we can explain it like this: that is, when the interbank lending rate was extremely high, the Shanghai financial community and the government authorities had used all methods to suppress it artificially. For example, the Central China and Jiaotong banks borrowed 10 million yuan at low interest rates to various banks and money shops to cope with emergencies, the Bank Preparation Committee issued fully circulating public orders for preparation property to regulate the market, the government frequently refuted rumors to stabilize people's hearts, and the foreign exchange stabilization committee purchased 20 million yuan from Hong Kong to stabilize the financial situation. It is precisely because the recent trend of the interbank lending rate is artificial, so if the silver problem is not resolved in the future, it will inevitably follow the bankruptcy of the countryside, the poverty of farmers, the lack of large amounts of cash inflows, and the powerlessness of the Shanghai financial community and the government, and there is no doubt that it will fluctuate upward again.</p>
<h3>An Outline of Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>Some say that the foreign exchange war was initiated by France, with Britain bearing the brunt, and Japan and the United States also drawn into the vortex. (AArnaune: Le Monnaie LeGredit et Le Change) Subsequently, the war zone expanded, evolving over the years, until today, there is almost no place without its example. Shanghai, as a major financial hub in the East, with frequent trade and numerous merchants, its foreign exchange market has naturally become a corner of the foreign exchange battlefield. However, if we stand on the edge of a shallow beach, we will only see a vast expanse of surging waves, their undulations impossible to fathom. But if we ascend to a high hill, stretch our necks and gaze afar, the water and sky will form a horizon, and the ebb and flow of the tide will not be without traces to follow. The fluctuations of foreign exchange are similar. In a single day, it suddenly tightens and suddenly loosens, never settling. Days accumulate into months, and months are difficult to understand; months accumulate into years, and years are difficult to understand. Therefore, I will provide an overview of the rise and fall of foreign exchange in Shanghai over the past year, extract its essence, and explore its source, in order to discern the long-term trends in economics and glimpse a corner of the international foreign exchange market's changes.</p>
<p>(2) General Trends</p>
<p>In today's world, few do not adopt a policy of "exchange rate dumping." After the war, France restored the gold standard, but the new parity was only one-fifth of the old parity. After Britain abandoned the gold standard in the autumn of 1931, it also quickly inflated its currency; neighboring Japan followed suit. Since the bank crisis swept through America, and panic intensified, at the end of last January, there was a move to reduce the parity to 59.06 cents. Other countries, such as Czechoslovakia and Austria, have also followed suit, but as they are small countries, they have not been noticed by us. The purpose of exchange rate dumping is either to reduce the debt burden or to promote foreign trade: the United States and Japan fall into the latter category, while European countries do both. Our country is a dumping ground for surplus goods and a hunting ground for the great powers, and exchange rate changes are the best reflection of this.</p>

<p>(Note) This is compiled by the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China based on nine telegraphic transfer rates.</p>
<p>If we follow the chart, we can see that new highs have been reached repeatedly over the past year. Except for May, when the market was extremely chaotic and in an abnormal state, there has been a gradual upward trend. The average of 66.82 in September was the highest in five years. This is only in terms of the overall trend. If we further analyze the changes in its components, the rise of the US dollar is the most dramatic, followed by the Japanese yen, then the shilling and rupee, while the French franc, florin, mark, etc., have changed less. The latter have a looser relationship with our country. The compilation of the overall index treats all equally, without weighting, so the result is not sufficient as an indicator of the foreign exchange market in our country. Let us further analyze and study it.</p>
<p>(3) Individual Variations</p>
<p>Looking at the foreign exchange market last year, it can be divided into five periods: (1) the Ascending Period, (2) the Descending Period, (3) the Stagnant Period, (4) the Chaotic Period, and (5) the Calm Period. This is purely a fabrication for the convenience of description. Whether it is accurate is subject to the clarification and correction of experts.</p>
<p>Ascending Period (January to March) In January, the Japanese parliament debated the fiscal expansion bill, and the movement to reduce the parity of the US dollar had been brewing for a long time, and the time was ripe, causing foreign exchange to fluctuate. The US and Japanese currencies rose rapidly: the Japanese yen reached a maximum of 113.5 yuan (Japanese gold, the same below), more than 18 yuan higher than the average of 95.01 yuan in the same period last year. The US dollar rose by about 15 yuan (US dollars, the same below), with a maximum price of 34.5 yuan, while the average in the same period last year was only 19.8214. By February, it was the Lunar New Year, and demand was usually slack. In the third week, speculators poured a small amount of foreign currency into the market, and then the rumor that the US would raise the price of silver was revived, and gold sellers dumped foreign exchange, forming a rather spectacular short position of 15 million yuan. In the fourth week, news from the US bank was silent, the shorts were passive, and gradually bought back, causing confusion. In this month, foreign exchange in this port generally rose, with the US dollar rising the most sharply, with an average price of 33.966 yuan, an increase of 4.66 cents compared to the previous month. The shilling was flat, and the Japanese yen rose to 113.32 yuan, an increase of 2.07 yuan compared to the same period last year. The market in March remained the same. It is worth mentioning that at the end of February, India announced a reduction in silver import duties; Chinese merchants shipped silver to Bombay, and the Indian rupee rose sharply, reaching a maximum of 94.25 rupees, with an average of 89.35 rupees. The Japanese yen also rose, with a maximum price of 115 yuan and an average of 113.75 yuan this month, a new record in recent years. In addition, all other currencies were tighter than last month. The maximum price of the US dollar was 34.75 yuan, slightly tighter than last month, but the average price eased by 7.5 cents to a new high of 34.25 yuan: the impact of the silver policy had not yet subsided. The maximum price of the British pound was 1 shilling 4 pence 375, and the average was 1 shilling 4 pence 125, both tighter than last month.</p>
<p>Descending Period (April to June) By April, the market tended to go downstream. The overseas silver market fluctuated, the spot price rose, and although foreign exchange hedging transactions were prevalent, commercial demand remained lifeless. The biggest drops were in the Japanese yen and the US dollar: the Japanese yen reached a maximum of 113.25 yuan, with an average of 110.59 yuan, a drop of 3.16 yuan compared to the previous month. The reason for this was that Japan implemented the "Gold Purchase Law," which caused the price of Japanese gold to soar. The US dollar reached a maximum of 34.75 yuan, with an average of 32.50 yuan, a decrease of 0.286 yuan compared to the previous month, which was due to the decline of the silver movement. The British pound was more stable, hovering around 1 shilling 4 pence. The market in May continued the sluggishness of the previous month, and became even more precarious. Rumors about international gold and silver issues arose frequently (there were rumors that France would abandon the gold standard, and Germany spread rumors that the mark would depreciate), the market atmosphere was unstable, and the overall trend of exchange rates was downward. In the third week, news spread that the US silver policy would have new developments, and the port's currencies rose accordingly. The British pound rose to 1 shilling 3 pence 625, and the US dollar reached 33.625 yuan. In the fourth week, the US levied a 500% silver profit tax, and exchange rates weakened. In the first two weeks of June, the stagnation remained unchanged. In the third week, confidence turned strong, and market prices gradually rose. In the fourth week, the US passed the Silver Act, and the price of silver soared, causing foreign exchange to rise across the board, marking a major turning point. The British pound reached a maximum of 1 shilling 4 pence, a minimum of 1 shilling 3 pence 375, and an average of 1 shilling 3 pence 575, an increase of 0.346 pence compared to the previous month. The US dollar reached a maximum of 33.75 yuan, a minimum of 32.75 yuan, and an average of 32.76 yuan, an increase of 0.566 yuan compared to May. The Japanese yen reached a maximum of 112.25 yuan, with an average of 109.04 yuan, an increase of 2.952 yuan.</p>
<p>Stagnant Period (July) 丨丨 In the first week, the market was affected by the bank's closing holiday, and international news was quiet, speculators hesitated, and the market was stable. Except for a slight loosening of currencies from the 6th to the 9th, there were no major changes. In the second and third weeks, HSBC's listing remained largely unchanged. In the fourth week, the Dalian gang dumped a large amount, and exchange rates tightened slightly, but silver prices were weak, and speculators' enthusiasm was greatly reduced, so it quickly returned to its original state.</p>
<p>Chaotic Period (August) 丨丨 In the first week, rumors spread in the market, people's hearts were fluctuating, and exchange rates were affected. The shilling and the US dollar rose sharply: the British pound rose from 1 shilling 4 pence and one-sixteenth to 1 shilling 4 pence and five-sixteenths: the US dollar rose from 33.75 yuan to 34.25 yuan. In the second week, the US Silver Nationalization Act was officially announced, and rumors of currency inflation were even more prevalent, and overseas silver prices soared. The British pound reached a new high, with immediate telegraphic transfers at 1 shilling 4 pence 6875, and the US dollar reaching a maximum price of 35.375 yuan, and bank sellers dumped relentlessly. In the third week, the market changed rapidly, and speculation was not quiet, with one wave after another. In the fourth week, speculators scrambled to buy US dollars, the outflow of silver was unprecedented, and a major bank dumped a large amount of British pounds again, making it bizarre and indescribable.</p>
<p>Calm Period (September to December) 丨丨 In these months, although there were small waves, the overall situation was very stable. In the first week of September, the United States temporarily suspended the purchase of silver, overseas silver prices were flat, the port's spot price rose slightly, and exchange rates also fluctuated slightly. In the second week, the Ministry of Finance's order to crack down on spot gold and foreign exchange speculation caused the foreign exchange market to stagnate. In the third and fourth weeks, the banking industry cooperated with the Ministry of Finance to reject speculative transactions, so trading was very quiet. Although market prices rose, with the US dollar reaching a maximum of 36 yuan and the British pound reaching 1 shilling 5 pence 375, the highest price since the abolition of the tael and the introduction of the yuan. However, speculators had disappeared, and the actual commercial demand was weak, so the market price was just a facade. In the first week of October, the situation remained the same. In the second week, exchange rates rose again and again, with the British pound reaching 1 shilling 6 pence, the US dollar reaching 37.5 yuan, and the Japanese yen approaching 130 yuan. In the third week, the Ministry of Finance began to levy silver taxes, and then returned to normal. Although the market was extremely uneasy, and foreign banks were trying to manipulate it, thanks to the joint assistance of the Central Bank and Chinese banks, it was able to overcome the difficulties. The fourth week was the same. In November, the previous static state was restored, with a gentle breeze and no waves. At the end of the second week, the price of silver in London rose by a large amount of 1.25 pence, and the foreign exchange market should have fluctuated greatly, but it was offset by the balancing tax, so it was able to turn danger into safety. The third and fourth weeks entered an even calmer state, the market was narrow, and people's hearts were stable, which was also a satisfactory thing in the financial world recently. In December, the market situation became more moderate, and foreign exchange changes were minimal. At that time, the rise of foreign short-term funds had subsided, and the reduction in local inventories eased. In the second week, there were rumors of currency inflation, and speculators scrambled to buy foreign currency. In the third week, the Ministry of Finance and Wang Jingwei declared that changes in currency policy were unfounded, and people's hearts were settled, but the British and American currencies were still slightly firm. In the fourth week, due to Christmas, the market was stable and not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The market situation over the past year has been briefly described here. Where there are omissions, the reader should draw inferences from one instance. A table is provided below for reference.</p>

<p>(4) Conclusion</p>
<p>The change in foreign exchange, in its normal state, should be viewed as shifting with the trade balance (in a broad sense). However, if we carefully examine the change in foreign exchange in our country, speculative trading is the main reason. Its changes are erratic and flickering, either manipulated by one or two major players, or stirred up by unfounded rumors. The more dramatic the exchange rate changes, the more the stability of the currency is hindered, leading to an impact on prices and disrupting finance. The authorities, aware of this, have taken steps to remedy it, which has been quite effective. It is a pity that only partial measures have been implemented, and a comprehensive plan for managing foreign exchange has not yet been promoted. Recently, experts and scholars have contributed many opinions, and the authorities seem likely to accept them. As the poem says, "Although Zhou is an old state, its destiny is renewed." How much more so should the government of the National Revolution be?</p>

<h3>Financial Credit Remains Tight</h3>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate Opens at Six Percent</p>
<p>Cautious Lending Among Peers</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of trading and also a Sunday. Most businesses were still in a state of suspension, resulting in very little trading. The foreign interbank lending market rose again, opening at six percent yesterday, an improvement of four points compared to the previous session. However, due to the unfavorable situation during the final settlement, peers were wary and unwilling to lend extensively, resulting in limited interbank bill trading. The turnover for early morning transfers was just over 1.1 million, with new transactions amounting to over 300,000. Private banks received over 5 million in foreign public bonds, and remittance receipts from various routes totaled over 200,000. The only external source was 100,000 in "God of Wealth" silver dollars from Suzhou, with no other sources reported. There were also no outflows. In terms of subsidiary currency, the situation remained stable. Although there were minor fluctuations, the amounts were insignificant. In the early morning, Jiangnan small dollars opened at 830 yuan, unchanged from the previous session, with 3,000 "jiao" traded. Guangdong small dollars decreased slightly by two "jiao" from the previous day, to 758.8 yuan, with 40,000 "jiao" traded. Copper coins were priced at 317,000 "wen," slightly lower than the previous day's price, with 26,945 strings of "wen" traded, equivalent to 8,500 yuan. The afternoon session is not expected to resume until after the Lantern Festival.</p>

<h3>Securities Market: Bond Market on the Previous Week for Two Days</h3>
<p>The 1934 Customs Bonds Soar by Two Yuan</p>
<p>During the week of February 4th to 9th, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was closed due to the Lunar New Year holiday from Monday to Thursday, resulting in completely no trading. Prior to the holiday, the final settlement period was approaching. The financial sector, affected by the tight credit situation, was unable to borrow funds, leading to the liquidation of four institutions, and fueling further rumors. When the securities market reopened on Friday, various difficulties had been overcome. Even among the institutions that had declined, only a few were not present. The key reason was the tight credit conditions, making it difficult to provide loans and mortgages. Consequently, market prices and investor sentiment were not optimistic. Many long positions had been closed, and short positions were opened before the holidays. However, the government, recognizing the instability in the financial sector, established a Currency Preparatory Committee, which boosted investor confidence. On the 8th, the market opened, and prices rose due to the two factors mentioned above. Both those covering short positions and new long positions demonstrated interest. There was particularly strong demand for the 1934 Customs Bonds. On Friday, the first day of trading, prices rose sharply by 1.6 yuan in just half a day, exceeding expectations. On Saturday, prices gradually weakened, but the 1934 bonds continued to rise, closing with even stronger gains. As a result, the week's price fluctuations were significant. Excluding the March contracts, which were newly introduced and not comparable, the February 1934 Customs Bonds had risen by as much as two yuan. Other contracts also increased by three or four "jiao," while the 1933 bonds decreased slightly by one "jiao." The total turnover for the two days was 20.022 million yuan. The results of the price fluctuations are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Softens Amid Quiet Conditions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the American cotton market saw lukewarm interest from peers, with limited trading. Prices were the same as the previous day, with occasional drops of one pound. Sales were limited, and the market was stable. Later, due to short covering, prices declined slightly. Both sides adopted a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting the verdict on the gold bar case, resulting in an unusually sluggish market. (According to a Washington dispatch, no verdict was announced on Monday). Closing prices were flat, with spot prices down five points and futures prices down two to five points. The British cotton market was firm and high, with spot prices up six points and futures prices up one to four points. Indian cotton initially fell due to futures traders selling, but rebounded due to Japanese merchants buying Oomra cotton. Bengal remained unchanged, while Oomra rose 1.75 rupees. The original telegram records are listed below (February 29th dispatch):</p>

<h3>How Can We Popularize Chinese Scientific Medicine? (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Yu Yunxiu, recorded by Jiang Huiming</p>
<p>Speaking of China, things are similar to Japan in that there was the Classics scholarship of the Qing Dynasty. As you all probably know, the Song Dynasty emphasized the study of human nature and principles, respecting the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, and Mencius. They relied on personal fantasies, incorporating discussions from the Buddhist school, producing a kind of Song learning that talked about nature and principles, all being words that avoided reality and escaped into emptiness. However, what they discussed could all be used as a safeguard for the imperial system. Therefore, from the Song Dynasty onwards, through the Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, political figures all utilized and respected it. However, in the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, there were already Gu Tinglin, Hu Anming, Mao Xihe, and others who advocated textual research and refuted empty theories. By the mid-Qing Dynasty, Hui Dong and Dai Zhen expanded the study of textual research, interpreting the classics based solely on the doctrines of Han Confucians. Thus, it became a school of thought called Han learning, among which Dai Zhen had the greatest influence. Because Dai possessed a unique spirit of steadfastness and the ability to learn extensively and remember powerfully, he completely overturned the empty and impractical Song learning that emphasized human nature and principles. As for interpreting the classics, every word and phrase had to have a source, and no speculation was allowed. Dai wrote a book, "Commentary on the Meaning of Words in Mencius," which refuted the rationality and heavenly way advocated by Song Confucians to the point of utter devastation. It should be known that the Song Confucians' theories of human nature and principles were tools for emperors to govern from above, a shackle on freedom of thought. Therefore, overturning it provided the impetus for the liberation of the people's freedom of thought, and the emperors' policy of keeping the people ignorant lost an important line of defense. I have heard people say that the root cause of the Qing Dynasty's failure was actually derived from Han learning. This statement truly captures the relationship between the shift in academic thought and the people's hearts.</p>
<p>However, this kind of pragmatic academic pursuit occurred in China in the context of classics, so its impact was on political revolution; in Japan, it occurred in the context of medicine, so its direct impact was also on medicine. Unfortunately, there was no Dai Zhen in our old Chinese medical community. Otherwise, old medicine would have been reformed much earlier.</p>
<p>Later scholars of Han learning, like Mr. Sun Xingyan, were also great scholars of Han learning. He once proofread and published several medical books, emphasizing archaeology. However, he was not a specialized physician, so he did not have much impact on Chinese medicine. Among the scholars of Han learning who had an impact on medicine, only Yu Yue, Mr. Yu Quyuan, existed. He had five essays on abolishing medicine, saying that old theories on pulse and medicine were not based on evidence, awakening the deaf and enlightening the benighted, enough to awaken people from two thousand years of delusion. However, in a vast country like China, where people's hearts are restless, no one cared about various essences and incisive discussions, and no one paid attention to them. As a result, influential words became non-influential! This is because Chinese physicians lacked the sincerity to seek truth from facts, which is also a difference in the transformation of medicine in China and Japan in recent centuries.</p>
<p>Now, I will present some common facts to prove how different the minds of political figures in China and Japan were regarding medicine. After the introduction of Western medicine in Japan, the so-called general practitioners of Chinese medicine were naturally not completely eliminated during the transition period. At that time, Japanese Chinese medicine practitioners, like Asada Sobaku, were very famous. The crown prince of the Meiji era—who became the Taisho Emperor—developed a lung disease, and it was said that Asada cured him. This statement is not necessarily true, but it is not necessarily without basis. Because tuberculosis is a chronic disease, its course is very long, and changes can vary greatly. It is not impossible to cure lung disease simply by relying on nutritional therapy. We do not care whether the Meiji Emperor's illness was truly cured by Asada. In any case, after taking Asada's medicine, the symptoms slowly improved, which is a fact. If this incident had occurred in China, it would have been terrible. Chinese medicine practitioners would have boasted and exaggerated greatly, and practitioners of new medicine would have been scolded as worthless. But in Japan? New medicine continued to advance vigorously with the power of politics, without being misled by this impression, without being superstitious about Chinese medicine, and without distrusting science. Ladies and gentlemen! How clear-minded were their political leaders?</p>
<p>I have been advocating medical revolution for many years. Every word and sentence I use to criticize old medicine is based on evidence. People with brains should have awakened long ago and should not hesitate on the wrong path again. What was the result? People in general society still speak and act casually about diseases and medicines. I have spoken to them until I am hoarse, but it is only a case of the speaker being sincere, and the listeners being indifferent. It is not uncommon for important people to invite old medicine practitioners to diagnose illnesses, but there are extremely significant implications in this. I feel that we Chinese people are all snobbish and full of vanity, not a nation that worships heroes and obeys truth! As long as powerful and famous people advocate something, the masses will blindly follow and agree, regardless of right or wrong. When Hu Shi contracted a kidney disease and was cured by Chinese medicine practitioners, he vigorously promoted them. As a result, he got to know several political bigwigs, who then supported him. The origin of the sanitarium probably came about in this way? And a group of political small-timers, seeing the bigwigs supporting the cause of national medicine, also joined in the reckless shenanigans, resulting in the National Medicine Hall, the National Medicine Regulations, and even further, turning the National Medicine Hall into a political yamen, creating a fantastic mess! This bizarre farce and distorted development have had a very significant direct impact on Chinese medicine. Therefore, our medical revolution has not yet succeeded, and national medicine practitioners are still active there. I dare say that this is all because these bigwigs have advocated it successfully from above! Alas! Ladies and gentlemen, think about it: Asada Sobaku cured the Meiji Emperor but could not establish another chair in the Imperial University and could not save the abandonment of Japanese Chinese medicine; National medicine practitioners cured a celebrity and got to know several bigwigs, which led to earth-shattering chaos, resulting in a bizarre drama, as if there was a fundamental problem in people's minds. Speaking of this, it truly makes people want to laugh and cry (to be continued).</p>
<p>Survey on the Health Conditions of Security Teams in Jiangsu Province Gu Gang</p>
<p>Since the "Outline for the Improvement of the Security Department System in Various Provinces" was issued by the Nanchang Headquarters "Security Conference" last year, security teams in Jiangsu Province have been reorganized one after another. By the end of the twenty-third year, the established teams included four security regiments, one special service battalion, forty-six security brigades, and a water security team, which were sufficient for the current dispatch in Jiangsu Province. In order to unify the power of affairs, the government appointed Chen Guofu, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, as the commander of the province's security forces. Mr. Chen has always attached great importance to various health undertakings. Therefore, since taking over as commander, the health agencies of the security teams have been actively reorganized, and a rough framework has been established. The following is a description of the findings of the survey:</p>
<p>A. Health Administration</p>
<p>The "Security Department" originally had a Fourth Section, which was dedicated to handling matters related to health administration and personnel issues of various teams. In October of the twenty-third year, it was ordered to be abolished and taken over by the "Military Hospital."</p>
<p>B. Health Education</p>
<p>1. Military Doctor Training Class</p>
<p>Process: The class was prepared in August of the twenty-third year and enrolled students for classes in October. There were fifty students, who graduated after six months. The admission requirement was that they had served as junior or second lieutenant military doctors or had practiced in public or private hospitals for more than four years. All expenses were provided by the provincial government. After graduation, they were assigned to various brigades by the provincial government and employed as junior or second lieutenant military doctors.</p>
<p>Organization: There was one colonel director, one major academic director, one colonel and one lieutenant colonel instructor, three majors, four captains, and one captain and one first lieutenant as team leaders. All aspects of life followed military training.</p>
<p>Curriculum: General courses included nine subjects: pharmacology, diagnostics, internal medicine, surgery, venereology, dermatology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and Party principles. Specialized courses included six subjects: military hygiene, peacetime health service in the army, wartime health service in the army, poison gas prevention course, military medical regulations, and military science. There were thirty-eight hours of academic subjects and twelve hours of practical subjects per week.</p>
<p>2. Nurse Training Class</p>
<p>This class was run by the "Military Hospital." The curriculum focused on nursing and dispensing. The first class has already graduated, and most of them have stayed in the "Military Hospital" for employment.</p>
<p>C. Health Agencies</p>
<p>1. Military Hospital</p>
<p>Overview: The hospital is located in Zhenjiang. It was reorganized from the "Medical Clinic of the Security Department" in the twenty-second year. There are more than forty hospital rooms, fifty ordinary beds, and twenty isolation beds. After the establishment of the "Security Teams" throughout the province this year, it has become insufficient. Expansion is currently being planned, and for the convenience of the Jiangbei bandit suppression troops, a branch hospital is planned to be added in the central area of Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Organization: One colonel director (Cheng Xueming), two major directors (Bi Huankui, Zhang Qihua), two captain military doctors, one first lieutenant pharmacist, one first lieutenant head nurse, thirty nursing soldiers, and quartermasters, adjutants, clerks, librarians, and special service chiefs.</p>
<p>Expenses: The provincial government allocates 450 yuan per month for medical expenses and 200 yuan for office expenses. The salaries of officers and soldiers are paid according to the regulations of the military department and paid according to their ranks.</p>
<p>2. Medical Clinics of Various Regiments</p>
<p>The medical clinics of various regiments follow the regiment headquarters. Each clinic has one major director, two captain military doctors, one first lieutenant military doctor, and ten nursing soldiers. The monthly medical expense is 150 yuan, the office expense is 50 yuan, and the salaries are paid according to their ranks.</p>
<p>3. Medical Clinics of Various Brigades</p>
<p>The medical clinics of all forty-six brigades in the province have not yet been established. They must wait for the first class of the "Military Doctor Training Class" to graduate before the provincial government assigns them and establishes them separately. According to the regulations, each brigade has one junior or second lieutenant military doctor, one nursing soldier, and two nursing attendants. The salaries are received according to their ranks, there are no office expenses, and the medical expenses are calculated at one dime per soldier per month, with a total of 50 yuan per month.</p>
<p>In short, the health undertakings in Jiangsu Province are improving day by day, such as the qualification of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners throughout the province, the establishment of medical colleges, the expansion of midwifery schools and provincial hospitals, the trial implementation of the public prostitution system in the provincial capital, and the addition of health sections in various counties. Now, the reorganization of the health agencies of the security teams throughout the province is something to compete for honor with various provinces. This is only a survey of the health conditions of the security teams, providing a reference for military and political authorities in various provinces and those who care about military medical undertakings.</p>
<p>The Pathological Conditions of the Chinese Medical Profession (Part 1) Shen Songnian</p>
<p>In China, where everything is backward in the modern era, how can the "medical profession" be any different? Speaking of it, we really feel ashamed! Since Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and the Yellow Emperor wrote the Inner Canon, establishing the foundation for medicine, although many pioneers have worked hard to give our country's medicine a lot of progress, this progress is really pitiful! Their (ancient medical pioneers) contributions are only extremely childish, only fragmented, incomplete, and half-understood experiences. Even if they wrote books and published them, they had very deep prejudices and insisted on forcibly matching them with the mystical theories of the five elements. They misled people with childish knowledge and narrow vision into a fog. Later generations, after receiving its baptism and being infected by it, also had the same subjective views as him: believing that they could apply it simply by relying on its knowledge. We are not sages and should not seek anything else. The words of sages are always correct and do not need to be improved. Everyone has this idea in their hearts and minds, so until modern times, the Chinese medical profession is still full of the metaphysical spirit of before the nineteenth century, too far away from the scientific medicine of advanced countries.</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>In recent decades, the Chinese people have accepted foreign high-pressure culture and have been stimulated in various ways, deeply knowing that if they continue to be so metaphysical, decline is just around the corner. Therefore, scientific medicine has emerged to replace it, which is commendable! However, the reality is not entirely so! There are pathological conditions in it. Now, I will summarize and discuss them below for the research of like-minded people.</p>
<p>A. The Lack of Universality of Scientific Medicine</p>
<p>In this transitional era, the angry tide of science has already soared into the clouds, and people with slightly more knowledge have also firmly believed in it. However, more than 80% of the illiterate people still cannot get the benefits of science. The reasons are very complex, and I will briefly describe them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Most Scientific Medicine is Too Aristocratic</p>
<p>Medical graduates who are accustomed to the comfortable life of the city strive for the most exquisite when practicing medicine in order to satisfy their material enjoyment. Therefore, they have to calculate on the patients and desperately raise consultation fees to compensate for it. But in this depressed folk, how can they afford this high medical expense? Even if the doctors can waive their consultation fees, I am afraid that most common people still cannot afford the medicine expenses. For example, diphtheria serum that costs dozens of yuan is unaffordable for common people, and they have to rely on metaphysical doctors.</p>
<p>(2) Most Scientific Medicine is Too Westernized</p>
<p>In this transitional era, before a truly Chinese representative medicine has emerged, there are factions in the country such as English, American, German, Japanese, and French, and they also call themselves German doctors, Japanese doctors, etc., as if they have no relationship with China, as if they have just moved from other countries. Everything strives for Westernization and does not consider the people's conditions at all. Consultation fees and drug costs can be arbitrarily raised by them. Therefore, most common people are daunted and lose their belief in them.</p>
<p>(3) Affected by Impostor Scientific Doctors</p>
<p>Doctors in the style of street peddlers, of course, lack knowledge and have despicable personalities. They only rely on a little experience and skills they have stolen, such as the workers who used to carry bags in hospitals. They actually go to the countryside to practice medicine, claiming to be scientific doctors. Just imagine, if such ignorant and unskilled people engage in the medical profession, is it inevitable that there will be no danger? Once it happens, it gives the common people a bad impression, thinking that all scientific doctors are like this. Therefore, the entire scientific medicine is implicated and affected!</p>
<p>(4) Affected by Metaphysical Doctors</p>
<p>Metaphysical doctors are the practitioners of inherent medicine in our country. Although they do not conform to scientific principles and have fallen behind in the modern era, because they can understand the people's conditions and suit the economic ability of the common people, they are still believed by most common people even though they are now in a period of struggling to survive. They are obstacles to the development of scientific medicine and can hinder the development of scientific medicine.</p>
<p>(5) The Deformity of Scientific Medicine</p>
<p>Because of the lure of material interests, people flock to the cities, so cities have achieved deformed development. As a result, scientific medicine has become excessive in cities, while the countryside is pitifully poor, not enough to allocate one ten-thousandth of it.</p>
<p>(6) The Decline of the Chinese People's Knowledge</p>
<p>Illiteracy is everywhere in our country. Even those with a little knowledge do not know the true meaning of scientific medicine, so their belief is very weak.</p>
<p>(7) Affected by Superstition</p>
<p>Superstition is the great enemy of science. Only by breaking superstition can science develop. The superstition among the Chinese people is unique in the world. Ignorant and foolish people only know how to ask for divination and seek divination sticks to relieve diseases. If there is a chance of recovery from the disease, they think that the Bodhisattva is efficacious. If there is no cure, they think that it is caused by insincerity or that the lifespan has arrived. The Bodhisattva is always right. They basically do not know scientific medicine.</p>
<p>Understanding the above points, it is already roughly known what the crux of why scientific medicine cannot be universal is. Now let's see what the ranks of metaphysical doctors are like?</p>
<p>B. Metaphysical Doctors Who Turn Back the Clock are Filling the Countryside</p>
<p>The tide of the times is constantly advancing. When something new and progressive is produced, those who lag behind will be eliminated. "When palaces are built, cave dwellings are abandoned; when cooking is invented, raw food is abandoned." Everyone knows this. This shows that those who are not eliminated by artificial means will undoubtedly be eliminated by nature in the future! Anyone who knows the trend of the times will not deny it. Now it can be summarized into two categories:</p>
<p>(1) Those Who Play with the Old and Do Not Know How to Make Progress</p>
<p>This kind of people has a short-sighted vision. They only read books blindly. They think that after reading that book, they can apply it and do not go for further research. They regard the fragmented experiences they have occasionally discovered as extraordinary and keep them secret. They only know how to desperately preserve the inherent relics that are not suitable for modern times, calling it "preserving the national essence." They push back the wheels of human evolution by a century. Just imagine, is this possible? Among them, they can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>Confucian doctors: This kind of people was disappointed in seeking fame in the past and had no way to make a living, so they had to enter the medical profession to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>Family doctors: Their ancestors also practiced medicine, and those who continue their ambitions call themselves family doctors, saying that it is passed down from their ancestors.</p>
<p>Apprentice doctors: This kind of people obtains their knowledge and experience from their teachers. After graduating in a few years, they can freely practice medicine.</p>
<p>These people's knowledge is extremely childish. Some can study medicine even if they have not graduated from elementary school. Only Confucian doctors read a little more, but their thinking is very stubborn because they are poisoned by the eight-legged essay. Just imagine, if the profound medical profession is in the hands of these people, it is no wonder that Chinese medicine has not made progress so far. In the past, the medical profession in those advanced countries was also in the hands of ignorant monks. Later, it was transferred to the hands of people with profound knowledge, so there is such progress today. Among them, they are divided into the current school and the classics school. The current school of doctors takes the method of slow treatment to treat diseases; the classics school is the opposite.</p>
<p>As for the books they read, they have no system and are inconsistent. Each has its own sect; of course, opinions are divided, just like a plate of loose sand, without any unity and mutual assistance. They only know how to destroy the reputation of their colleagues. They do not consider the national interests and future prospects. They only know how to desperately reject foreign advanced theories, thinking that they hinder the national essence. They only know how to calculate consultation fees in their minds; it can be said that they know nothing else.</p>
<p>(2) The More Novel-Minded Reformers</p>
<p>This kind of people is really pitiful. They clearly know the greatness of science but have no way to get started. The environment does not allow them to have the opportunity to further their studies, so they have to wander on the wrong path and do not know what to do. When there is an opportunity, they desperately study all kinds of books. In fact, this kind of people can become useful if given the opportunity to further their studies and can become China's representative doctor. Otherwise, there will be many drawbacks and it will be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Disease Knowledge Q&amp;A Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(53) Sepsis (Septicemia) (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Q) What is called sepsis?</p>
<p>(A) Sepsis is the general term for various severe bacterial systemic infections. In most cases, a primary lesion first occurs in a certain part of the body, and the virus continuously or intermittently flows into the blood from this part, thus causing systemic sepsis. However, there are also cases where the primary lesion is unknown.</p>
<p>(Q) Sometimes, it is called septicopyemia. What kind of disease is this?</p>
<p>(A) This is the disease in which multiple metastatic suppurations occur in various organs at the same time as sepsis, so it is also called pyemia.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the pathogenic bacteria of sepsis?</p>
<p>(A) The most common pathogens of sepsis are streptococcus and staphylococcus; followed by pneumococcus and E. coli; occasionally, meningococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, typhoid bacillus, or putrefactive bacteria, etc.</p>
<p>(Q) Where are the points of entry for these pathogens?</p>
<p>(A) There are many points of entry: such as the skin (in the case of wounds, carbuncles, bedsores, cellulitis), female organs (during childbirth, abortion), oral cavity (in the case of dental caries, tonsillitis), otitis media, digestive organs (in the case of esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, rectal cancer, dysentery, liver abscess, biliary tract inflammation, appendicitis), respiratory organs (in the case of rhinitis, bronchitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, pulmonary gangrene, empyema), urinary organs (in the case of gonorrhea, cystitis, pyelonephritis, kidney abscess, etc.), old suppurative lesions (in the bones and joints, etc.), etc. There are also cases where the point of entry is unknown.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the initial symptoms when sepsis occurs?</p>
<p>(A) Most of them start suddenly with chills, shivering, and fever without any prodromal symptoms.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the situation after the fever of sepsis?</p>
<p>(A) In most cases, the fever is fluctuating or intermittent. However, there are also cases where it persists. Before the fever, there are chills and shivering, and the body temperature rises to 40 or 41 degrees Celsius or above. After not much time, it drops sharply, and the same temperature and chills are repeated. This is called septic fever.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the phenomena on the skin when sepsis occurs?</p>
<p>(A) The skin develops hemorrhagic symptoms, with punctate or widespread subcutaneous and mucosal bleeding (bleeding gums, epistaxis, hematuria, bloody stools, etc.). Sometimes, scarlet fever-like, measles-like, polymorphic exudative erythema, or nodular erythema appears. There are also cases of pustular rash or creeping rash.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the changes in the circulatory system when sepsis occurs?</p>
<p>(A) The heart develops vesicular murmurs, and the boundary of cardiac dullness expands; at this time, it can be known that pericarditis or myocarditis has occurred. The pulse is rapid and irregular. Red blood cells decrease and white blood cells increase in the blood. In severe cases, white blood cells may also decrease.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms in the nervous system?</p>
<p>(A) Patients with sepsis often have headaches, vomiting, delirium, drowsiness, and convulsions, which are very similar to the symptoms of meningitis. If brain abscess, cerebral hemorrhage, purulent meningitis, leptomeningitis, etc. have occurred, hemiplegia, hemiconvulsions, aphasia, etc. suddenly occur. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(33) Scarlet Fever (Continued)</p>
<p>Complications of scarlet fever: When suffering from scarlet fever, complications often occur. The more complications occur, the more pain and danger the patient will suffer. Fortunately, not all patients develop various complications. Their severity is also uncertain. Sometimes, it is a mild complication with no life-threatening relationship. Sometimes, it is a severe complication that often has a fatal danger. This situation is entirely determined by the nature of the epidemic of the disease, the toxins of the disease, the patient's resistance, the timing of treatment, and the appropriateness of the treatment, etc. Now, let's talk about the most common and most important complications of scarlet fever.</p>
<p>(1) Necrotic Inflammation of the Pharyngeal Mucosa and Tonsils: This refers to scarlatinal diphtheria. It occurs around the third or fifth day of scarlet fever. Its phenomenon is that dirty grayish-white spots appear on the tonsils, palatal arches, uvula, etc. These spots enlarge rapidly. The mucosal tissue gradually forms dry necrosis. If this part peels off, it will cause material defects. At the same time, the lymph nodes in the neck and under the jaw are all markedly swollen.</p>
<p>(2) Submandibular Lymphadenitis and Cervical Lymphadenitis: This kind of lymphadenitis and tonsillitis and diphtheria have a close relationship. That is, the moderately enlarged lymph nodes caused by scarlet tonsillitis. If it is during scarlet diphtheria, it will be even more enlarged and hardened, with obvious and severe tenderness. As for purulent periglandular inflammation, cervical cellulitis, and retropharyngeal abscess, the result of the spread of inflammation mostly occurs in severe scarlet diphtheria.</p>
<p>(3) Scarlatinal Nephritis: Although mild proteinuria is found during fever in scarlet fever, it is not harmful. Because this phenomenon often occurs during the course of general fever diseases (so-called febrile proteinuria). However, sometimes by the third week (during the desquamation period), true nephritis gradually occurs. This is the so-called scarlatinal nephritis. At this time, the amount of urine is greatly reduced. A large amount of protein, blood, and cylindrical renal epithelium are excreted. The body temperature mostly rises. The patient's face and body often become edematous. Sometimes the disease progresses violently. Symptoms of uremia often appear (such as headache, vomiting, convulsions, drowsiness, etc.). Then it is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>(4) Suppurative Otitis Media: It mostly occurs on both sides (it is rare to be limited to one side). At this time, the body temperature rises again. The patient feels pain in the ear, tinnitus, difficulty hearing, and other ear symptoms. The eardrum often perforates, causing pus to flow from the ear. Therefore, it often causes swelling and pain in the mastoid process, becoming mastoiditis. In severe cases, its inflammation can often invade the meninges, dural sinuses, and brain parenchyma, etc., putting the patient in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>(5) Scarlatinal Articular Rheumatism: During the desquamation period of scarlet fever, the joints often develop mild swelling, pain, skin redness, and motor disorders. It commonly affects the wrist joints, finger joints, and knee joints. It mostly spreads to most joints. Fortunately, its course is benign. The inflammatory symptoms can be relieved in about a week. However, it can sometimes turn into suppurative arthritis. Therefore, there is often a danger of developing sepsis. This is because streptococci invade the joints. (To be continued)</p>
<p>New Book Introduction</p>
<p>"Essential Knowledge for Nursing in Isolation Hospitals," edited by Dr. Zhong Zhihe and published by the Hangzhou Guangji Medical Society, has rich content and excellent printing. The causes, ups and downs, and symptoms of infectious diseases are all explained in detail. All medical and nursing circles should have one copy per person, so it is specially introduced.</p>
<p>The Medicine of Pain Relief Li Xing</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Pain is the great enemy of life. No one in the world is not afraid of death, and no one is not afraid of pain. Many people are more afraid of pain than death. Because of this pain, many people willingly bow their heads and become slaves to narcotics, being tightly bound by narcotic drugs, ruining their bodies and reputations, and losing their families and properties, even selling their friends and betraying their country at any cost. It is all because of this pain, and it is all for the purpose of relieving pain. Therefore, pain is evil, and improper methods of relieving pain are also evil. Understanding what kind of physiological effect pain is in the body, how to relieve pain with proper methods, how to relieve pain without narcotic drugs, and how to not become slaves to narcotic drugs all belong to the medicine of pain relief. This is not a vague method of pain relief. It is a completely scientific medical method. I hope that the people of the country will pay special attention to the research of this kind of medicine so as not to fall into the hell of drugs. This is the meaning of practicing a new life, being a healthy national, and not being a slave to drugs.</p>
<p>Pain is a subjective feeling in the human body. Only when you are in pain do you know what pain is. Only those who are in pain can describe pain; others cannot fully know. Some people experience more pain than ordinary people. Most people encounter pain because they cause it themselves or because they do not know how to prevent it. A small number of people's pain is caused by the environment. Now, I will describe the medicine of pain relief for readers to study.</p>
<p>Some people want to ask, why should there be pain? Is pain harmful or beneficial to people? The answer is that nature has given us this body, and each part has its own ingenious function. If a part is damaged, it will lose a part of its function. Then, if there is no pain, some people will not care even if they cut off one of their hands or gouge out one of their eyes. In this way, the body will soon not become a complete body. For example, if you put your finger on a hot stove, because you cannot bear the pain, you must quickly remove your finger from the stove. Conversely, if a person has no sense of pain, the finger will be burned in a few seconds. Therefore, if we do not have a sense of pain, we cannot protect our body for a long time. In this way, pain can be considered beneficial to people. How so? It is that when a part of the human body is injured, there will be pain. When there is pain, you must rest and be treated, and you must wait until it is fully healed before you can use it. From this, it can be seen that pain has a great relationship with maintaining the health of the body.</p>
<p>The Anatomy and Physiology of Pain What exactly is the function of pain in the body, and what exactly is pain, is very worthy of our research. Now, for example, when the hand is injured and the hand hurts, is the perception of pain in the injured part or in another part of the body? The answer is that the injury is in the hand, but the perception of pain is in the brain. Suppose that the part of the brain that manages pain has lost its function, then even if the hand is injured or any part is injured, there will be no feeling of pain. By analogy, the pain in any part of the body is the same. The diagram is attached below for explanation:</p>

<p>A Brief Discussion of Tuberculosis (40) Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Clinical Course</p>
<p>Several major symptoms of tuberculosis have already been roughly described in the preceding Chapter 7. But we know that tuberculosis is a most complex disease: according to the nature of the lesion, there are various categories of pathological anatomy; according to the size of the lesion, there are differences between the initial stage, secondary stage, and tertiary stage; just in terms of the beginning, there are differences between sudden and gradual; as for its state of progress, the final result, the detailed information of each layer of the course; each has its own special style. If we want to be familiar with the entire situation of the disease, it is absolutely not enough to rely solely on the several symptoms mentioned above; each type of the disease's course must be described separately. This is the clinical course described in this chapter!</p>
<p>What is the clinical course like? It is definitely not something that can be included in a fixed style. In pathological anatomy, there are already two types, exudative and proliferative; their clinical course is completely independent, each with its own special points. This is in terms of the completed style. As for the early diagnosis aspect, there are also several basic styles, each with its own special symptoms; for example, hilar lymph node tuberculosis is a prominent example. The term "apex of the lung tuberculosis" was also known to everyone in the past few years. Furthermore, if we trace the source, it is of course Ranke's initial complex (stage one). Although this is extremely difficult to recognize clinically, it also has its own characteristics and cannot be completely discarded without mentioning it. Therefore, the order of the preface in this chapter: first, the situation of Ranke's first stage, then several types in the early diagnosis aspect; finally, the completed style, roughly exudative and proliferative, is mentioned. This seems to be a bit more difficult for the readers to understand; in fact, according to the past and present of the disease, it should be in this order to be appropriate; I think the readers will definitely be able to understand this!

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Talking about the Joyous Tale of Xiong and Mao Blowing</p>
<p>Yesterday I opened the newspaper and saw a very large headline, "Record of the Grand Ceremony of Xiong and Mao's Wedding," and a subtitle that said, "The groom is radiant and full of spirit, and the bride is lightly powdered and extremely elegant." These two adjectives must have been written in a particularly vivid way by the reporter, but looking at the wedding photos published, it is not bad, it really makes one laugh at how deeply this old man is revived. He shaved off his long beard to become a new groom, creating this romantic love story. The many couplets hanging on the wall are the most laughable, such as Zheng Hongnian's couplet: "Children and grandchildren surround and welcome the new mother, and the old husband enjoys himself." Feng Chen Zhaoyu's couplet: "Former classmates become new aunts, and old uncles become older brothers-in-law." It is truly unique, with such wonderful people and such wonderful events.</p>
<p>In the old days, there were few such interesting things happening, so it is no wonder that everyone was surprised when they saw it. Because in the past, people like Xiong Fenghuang, with his status, prestige, and half a dozen concubines stored in his golden house, were not a big deal. Even if one of the main wives died, there would still be many concubines to accompany him, and he would never feel lonely or painful. Even in ordinary families, if the main wife died, they would find a concubine without anyone knowing. This was very ordinary and extremely common. So, when they reached that age, they would not go to find a main wife again. Now, the laws of the Republic of China "do not allow taking concubines, only taking main wives," so this romantic tale has been created. If we expose this magic trick a little, what is so strange about it?</p>
<p>Some people may say that since he is already over sixty years old, he does not need to find a wife again. In fact, it is not the case. I think the need for a wife for old people is even more serious than for young people. Young people need a wife to solve their sexual desires, but old people need it for more than that. First, it is spiritual comfort, second, it is care in daily life, and third, it is physiological assistance. The so-called "those who have a wife do not know the suffering of those who do not have a wife" applies not only to young people, but even more so to old people. Therefore, Confucius said, "At seventy, one cannot sleep without warmth." I think it is also based on experience.</p>
<p>As for the issue of sexual desire, according to the Spiritual Pivot and Simple Questions, a woman's Ren meridian becomes deficient at seven sevens, Tiankui (menstruation) ceases, and the earth passage is blocked; a man's liver qi declines at seven eights, Tiankui ceases, the kidney's storage declines, and the body is extremely depleted; at eight eights, the teeth and hair fall out. This only applies to ordinary people in general. As for those who are blessed by nature or have special constitutions, they are not in this example. I have seen old men over seventy years old who still need sexual desire just like young people. Therefore, as long as old people are energetic and have a full body, marrying a wife is not an unusual thing. Fenghuang's energy must not be weak.</p>
<p>Tao Huangcun bought a house in Gushan and felt lonely, so he took in a concubine. Liang Shanzhou, a lecturer, teased him with a poem. I will record two of them below as an ending. I heard that you are taking skills to the Rong River, and it is not cool after becoming Yin. No one cares about a lichee tree, so let the woodcutter take good care of it. It is not like Chao Yun serving the old Po, but like a celestial maiden accompanying Vimalakirti. There is Lin Hejing across the door, what can he do with holding the plum blossom in the cold.</p>
<p>Snow Qian</p>
<p>It is snowing all over the world. The snow is as small as powder, falling densely. After a while, the roads, roofs, and trees were lightly covered with a thin layer of white, like light gauze</p>
<h3>Rice Market Rises by One or Two Coppers After the Holiday</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources from various regions, including those arriving from the previous year, total more than 150 firms. The market should have been bustling, but the rain dampened the activity considerably. Sales to shops and households in both urban and rural areas were sluggish, and only about 1,000 bags were purchased by Qingdao firms. Therefore, although the opening market yesterday seemed better than last year, there was no substantial difference. The prices of thick japonica and late rice only increased by one or two coppers. Varieties such as Du Jian and Yin Yuan also saw slight increases.</p>
<p>Regular grade white japonica 12.50, Qingjiao late rice 10.30, Songjiang late rice 10.15, Tongli white japonica 12.50, another lot at 10.45, another lot at 10.25, Tongli Lujian 10.50, another premium lot at 10.60, another premium lot at 10.60, North Chack white japonica 10.40, another special lot at 10.80, Shantang early rice 11.15, Wujiang white japonica 10.50, another premium lot at 11.20, Qianxu dry rice 10.95, Chefang white japonica 10.55, another white rice at 11.15, Kuoxia early rice 10.95, Chenmu special japonica 10.40, Sijing special 10.85, Zhangyan early rice 10.90, Pingwang white japonica 10.25, Liantang late rice 9.90, Guangchen early rice 10.85, Pingwang special japonica 10.40, another lot going for 10.00, Ganxiang early rice 10.85, Lili white japonica 10.25, Huangqiao late rice 10.45, Yexie early rice 10.50, Shengze white japonica 10.15, another lot going for 10.70, Zhujing early rice 10.55, Zhouzhuang white japonica 10.10, another Yin Yuan 10.60, another Yin Yuan 10.60</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) It has been more than ten days since the market closed. The North Shanghai trade associations agreed to reopen yesterday. River warehouses have over 80 firms with inventory, factory warehouses have over 100,000 bags of white japonica, 20,000 bags of Bian Yuan, and 5,000 bags of Ke Jian. Yesterday's reopening was affected by the rainy weather, with few buyers appearing. Sales were slow across all varieties. Opening prices rose by one, two, or three coppers for various grades.</p>

<h3>Survey of Sugar Inventory in the Local Market</h3>
<p>As of February 3rd, the inventory of imported sugar in this city was over 130,000 bags. Because there are no statistics for domestic green, red, and white sugar, the following are approximate estimates of current stocks, and the actual numbers should not deviate significantly. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Imported Sugar</p>
<p>Commodity Type (Ending on a Specific Date) Compared to Last Session, Coarse Granulated White Sugar 76,663 Increase of 17,591, Dutch Red 20,015 Decrease of 14,611, Medium Granulated White Sugar 50 Decrease of 100, Cotton White 1,504 Decrease of 520, Cuban Red 27,350, Taikoo Car White 5,402 Increase of 1,102</p>
<p>Total: 130,984 Items</p>
<p>Domestic Sugar</p>
<p>Commodity Type Estimated Stock, Commodity Type Estimated Stock, Chaoqing 23,000, Zhu Qing 800, Hainan Red 2,000, Zhiyang 2,600, Yue Pian Qing 2,000, Zhi Chi 1,000, Quanzhou You 500, Huizhou White 800, You Red 500, Yue Coarse White 10,000, Xinghua Red 600, Total Estimated 43,800 Items</p>
<h3>3,000 Bags of Chaoqing Sugar Offered</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend was slightly better yesterday, but ultimately, the lack of activity on the trading floor led to few transactions. The association's set price of 17.80 yuan for Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar was not achieved. Dutch red and Taikoo sugar also saw few transactions. The factory's cotton white continued to be offered sporadically at the original price. Trading firms offered over 3,000 bags of Chaozhou green sugar. The market initially looked to rise slightly, so a trading firm previously sought 10.80 yuan for Zhuangqing, but sales remain sluggish, and the land price rose and then eased, so the upward trend faded. However, the current price is expected to stabilize and not fall further. Yesterday, Zhuangqing was offered at 10.50 to 10.40 yuan, Huanggang green at 10.20 to 10.10 yuan, Ban Nan green at 9.80 yuan, and Lungkong green at 9.60 yuan.</p>
