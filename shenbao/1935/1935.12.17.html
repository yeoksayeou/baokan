<h3>共同最高額與遠東均勢問題</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>倫敦海軍會議自開幕迄今已逾一週日來英美日三國對立狀態愈益明顯其尤可注意者日代表永野大將所提『各海軍國應保持共同最高限度以及削减攻勢兵力充實守勢兵力』一案乃爲英美兩國一致對日之中心問題</p>
<p>所謂海軍共同最高額易詞言之卽在列國海軍軍備平等原則之下决定共通的最大限度此一提案之本質純以日本之利害關係爲出發點而以獨占西太平洋及東亞大陸爲基準故此提案甫經發表會議空氣卽呈緊張英美兩國對遠東局勢密切注視之共同態度與英美兩國一致反對日本所提主張之共同態度東西相應美代表台維斯聲言『日本之所謂平等適足以造成實際上之不平等』而英國所支持之南菲聯邦代表則公然聲明以自主國之資格反對日本此項提議最近英國對日關係之緊張誠爲前此所罕見而英美之聯絡將因日本對海軍共同最高原則態度之强硬以及對東亞獨占之加强而更趨密切允爲吾人所當注意者也</p>
<p>吾人以爲倫敦海軍會議之基點有二其一爲保持遠東之均勢其二爲造成地中海之均勢允以保持遠東均勢爲會議之重心吾人默察此一週來海軍會議情勢之推移各國代表之言論以及個別間進行之會商莫不以此二問題爲中心當本月十四日英日代表私人會議進行之際英代表以坦率之態度向日代表團表示二點　海軍同等將使英國在遠東之地位居於人後因無論遠束時局如何英國艦隊必須有一大部份駐於歐洲海上也　英國所負帝國責任至爲重大實有維持較大海軍以保護平等與安全之必要美代表台維斯在海軍會議中所抱定之眞實主張雖未明確表示但其發言一則日保持比率主義再則曰維持「均勢」吾人窺其用意實欲保持遠東之各項旣成實力也法意在海軍會議之態度頗屬一致而保留潛艦與使直布羅陀歸還西班牙或中立化允爲兩國之共同主張其用意僅在保持地中海上之均勢耳</p>
<p>綜上所述吾人可知海軍會議中所討論之一般原則表面上雖係純技術的質的限制與量的縮减問題實則包括世界市塲之重新分割政治勢力範圍之重新劃分而日本所提出之决定「共同最高額」一案允與吾民族生存息息相關乃吾入處於今日情勢之下所不能漠視者也</p>

<p>巴黎　衆議院明日開會時、總理兼外長賴伐爾將就政府現行外交政策、提出報吿、此舉極爲一般人所關切、至不管部閣員卽急進社會黨領袖赫禮歐對於英法兩國所提意阿爭端妥協方案、原持堅决反對態度、茲聞共主張已轉和緩、藉免引起閣潮、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法國蒙倍利雅城　急進社會黨領袖不管部閣員赫禮歐、頃在此間急進黨支部宴會中發表演脫謂「吾人對於意阿戰爭、事前曾設法加以阻止、迨戰端旣啟、則主張覓得和解方案、俾戰事早日結束、庶幾同爲國聯會會員國之兩當事國得以趨于接近、此項主張現仍未改、惟和解方案僅當由兩當中國自由加以接受、若如國聯會葡萄牙代表所謂、以「程序上略奪行爲」、强使較弱較小之國家接受和解、則非吾人所能認可也、不寗惟此、和解方案尙須爲國聯會所接受、故當與國聯盟的及集體安全曁普遍和平制度之原則不相牴觸、今年日內瓦方面巳第一决實現合作之精神、此種精神値得欽佩、則又和解方案所當愛護而不可摧毀者也、今有此一偉大希望產生、任何法國人士之熟籌利害而顧及國家前途者、對於此種希望、固不能聽其毀滅也」云云、（按巴黎廻聲報日前載稱、赫禮歐反對英法兩國所擬意阿爭端解决方案、或將考盧出處問題、並恢復行動自由云）、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法名人集會巴黎　促進兩國合作　國聯範圍實施集體安全</h3>
<p>巴黎　英法兩國名人在此間舉行集會、討論英法合作及組織集體安全制度問題、前國聯會英國代表薛西爾勛爵發表演說、謂「樹立歐洲和平之道、不外英法兩國維持合作、與夫嚴格遵守國聯會規章兩者而已、英法兩國合作之後、大多數民族必以全力出而相助、惟兩國所作努力若欲克底於成、務當避免互相凌駕之念、所有一九一四年以前各種傾向如軍備競爭與訂立同盟區分歐洲之類、一律當予捐棄、並在國聯會範圍之內實施集體行動」云云、嗣由比國參議員羅陵·英國下院議員藍珊·法國衆法員龍蓋·及甘水溪等先後發表演說、其中甘氏謂「吾人若聽令某某國家以强力逞其所欲、則他日法國本身亦必受此種行動之害、殷鑒具在、可不愼乎」云云（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法擁議國聯會團體　通過一决議案　獎勵侵略惡例斷不可開</h3>
<p>巴黎　法國擁護國聯會各團體聯合會頃通過决議案、表示希望意阿戰事早日結束、謂「解決爭端之方案、務當以尊重國聯會盟的及集體安全制度之原則爲根據、始有確實綏靖之眞正價値、最後决議案要求意阿爭端之解决、「不當使侵略國獲利致開一不良先例」云云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意國慾壑難塡　對和平案將提重要保留</h3>
<p>羅馬　此間外交界今日表示、意國如接受英法兩國之和平方案、亦將有種種保留、致使該項方案僅存名義而已、觀察者稱、意國將對於重要各點逐一反對、以使方案之性質全部改觀、墨索里尼於星期三法西斯幹部會議之前、將不致有何决定、惟下述二項保留、大槪將爲彼所堅持、卽　意國不能交還阿克森城、　意國不能割讓阿薩白港或通連該港之地帶、　方案中所言阿國南部之意國勢力範圍尙有不滿之處甚多云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>羅馬報掉轉筆鋒　對破壞和平案施抨擊　指爲共產主義作祟</h3>
<p>羅馬　此間各報昨日曾對英法和平方案、猛烈加以攻擊、本日論調忽對於各國希圖破壞此項方案之人士、力事抨擊、謂全世界反對英法方案之運動、係由共產主義從中作祟云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法和平方案　國聯方面趨勢　明日提出政院會討論</h3>
<p>日內瓦　意阿爭端之局勢、本日並無新穎發展　　於英法兩國所提方案、國聯會秘書廳尙未接得意阿兩國政府任何答復、傳說意國興論對於爭端立卽解决之可能性、現已不復如前樂觀、各國代表團對於此訊、紛加評論、不一其辭、國聯會行政院已定十八日開會、各理事國代表行將陸續抵此、惟蘇聯外交委員李維諾夫是否出席會議、尙不可知、（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　據此間人士之意見、意國對和平方案之覆文、在星期四日或星期五日前不致發出、預料國聯行政院星期三日集議討論該方案時、將延宕其决議、現有理由可信至少有五國卽蘇俄。土耳其。羅馬尼亞·丹麥·西班牙·將棄權不投票、波蘭之態度亦殊可疑、如該問題於是提交國聯大會表决、則必有數國投反對票、某拉丁美利堅代表團已奉其政府訓令、如該問題提交大會、則應投票拒絕、故行政院處此情勢下、大約將委任特委會研究全問題以便斟酌情形提出新建議、此舉大的將使目前實施之對意禁令展緩擴大、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>俄報評英法建誶　達背國聯精神　英採此步驟有損威望　將引起近東嚴重後果</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯著於政治評論者拉狄克、今日在「伊期維期太」報發表一文、題爲「國聯與阿比西尼亞之瓜分」謂「英法兩國共同提出對於阿比西尼亞意大利及國聯之建議、此種消息、如一炸彈之爆裂、英法兩國外長提議使意阿兩國「交換領土」、似能完全保持「平等原則」但其實際、意大利用或此或彼方法、獲得阿比西尼亞領士之半、而阿國所得、僅阿薩白海上之出口、及通此海口之一走廊、實際已使阿比西尼亞落入意國掌握之中、此種提議、已在兩國國內輿論之中引起巨大憤激」、</p>
<p>拉氏詳論英法兩國在意阿衝突之中所處地位、指出「英法最近提議、實沿英法兩國過去所行政策之一跳躍、彼等表示背離國聯大會、因彼等願侵犯阿比西尼亞之主權、及國聯若干國家之公意、以博得意大利之放棄殖民地侵略戰爭　際此有巨大政治意義之問題、卽爲英國採取如此步驟、其理由果何在乎、蓋此步驟一旦實現、將在國聯中處於困難地位、卽在今日、已使不列顛政府威望大爲减損」、</p>
<p>拉氏叙述意報所議華北及埃及事件、迫令大不列顛不得不迅使自身自阿比西尼亞問題之中解脫、以及其他各地之類似報吿、繼謂「英國改變政策之理由、雖未完全明瞭、但菩人可知英國政府之作此種提議、實因深信無論如何、阿比西尼亞之中部尙可不被攫奪、英國政府顯已計及、給意巨大權利之書面允諾、並小能使問題因此解决、阿比西尼亞在此戰爭形勢之下、是吾願意允作如此讓步、尙係問題、英國政府顯已計及意大利仍將與阿搏擊、彼仍需要列强之物質援助、因此際此糾紛進行之中、尙可進行各種交易、</p>
<p>「吾人如一察此種放棄阿比西尼亞之政策、將使全盤東束情勢更　複雜、則可預知英國此種計算、或將全成幻想、阿比西尼亞之爭取獨立、業已引起斐洲有色民族及阿拉伯。叙里亞·巴力斯坦同敎徒之巨大同情、大不列顛現行政策、將不能使此一部份世界獲得安慰、如英法提議竟在阿比西尼亞邊境引起不幸事件、則由此所引起之阿比西尼亞戰士之回波、或將引起極嚴重之結果、</p>
<p>「事件已至如此地步、欲僅恃犧牲阿比西尼亞之外交談判以業出路、已不可能、吾人不知事實之將來發展究將如何、不知英國政府是吾將被迫放棄其提議、抑此提議楚吾將遭國聯反對、吾人亦不知法國在將來發展中將處若回地位、</p>
<p>「蘇聯人民之輿論、仍未變更吾人對於意阿衝突所取一貫態度、蘇聯贊助國聯反抗侵略之行動、此種行動已得五十　國承認、吾人不願與公認侵略者進行任何和平談判、因吾人不願增重國際間之困難、此種和平談判、必須遵守國聯所定目標、國聯規定保持和平之方法、在和平受人侵犯之際、國聯又曾規定强迫侵略者承被侵略國領十完整及主權獨立之方法、</p>
<p>「英法兩國所作建、並不能符保　的比西尼亞領土完整主權獨立之目標　而使阿國被人分割、淪爲奴隸、國聯大會保障會員國之獨立完整、並不建基於該國社會情形及民族構成之評價因此、此種舉世屬目之建議、實與國　目標毫無類似之點、反將直　傷害此種目標國聯可承認阿比西尼亞之要求以終止戰爭、但决不能强令阿國承認何種要求、或加何種壓力使其屈服」、（十五日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>日本表示見解　對英國動向深具戒心</h3>
<p>東京割讓阿比西尼之領士、卽追認意大利之侵略而圖解决東菲之英意抗爭、此項英法妥協試案之內容、已於十三日由國聯事務局公佈矣、國聯小國派全體反對該項提案、阿國政府拒絕受理之答覆亦勢所當然、現强行妥協之英國政府本身、該國內之非難竟給與保守黨內閣運命以一大暗影、而集中世界視綫於該案、日本政府對於英法對意大利之態度、表示至爲關心、而注視其事態之推移、故於十六日表明其見解如左、</p>
<p>美國保守黨內閣在再决確立對外强硬政策以前、遭受埃及之反英運動、復遇印度事態及華北問題之新展開、於是一心埋頭於東菲問題、欲維持其　外殖民地權益、則認爲達到最大危局、一方面在歐洲政局上倘强行東菲政策、是促進意大利永久之反英運動、而增長法意提携之氣運、同時成爲認可德國向奧國之進取、而維持大陸均衡之政策根本發生動搖矣、　故英國之最後政策、乃將阿國付之犧牲、使東菲問題結束、以便緩和意大利之態度，而使束菲印度紅海之政治通商錢再行確立、目前暫行退却、决心以圖將來之前進也、　在各小國則以擁護國聯爲維持本國之要諦、倘因英國之方便主義而追認意大利之侵略行爲、則將來本國領土之被人侵略、亦將有公認之命運、故此間英法兩國假國聯之名義追認意大利之侵略行爲、而强行所謂妥協案、當然視爲本國目下之生存問題、情形至爲嚴重也、至於該妥協案之實施、前途尙不無若干難關、可以豫想、然英國之所以採取緩和意國之工作、其根本原則、非僅爲英國之後退、實欲作更形發展之前進、此乃其準備工作至堪重視者也、是以吾人對於英國之於軍縮問題及東亞問題其　取决期工作之動向、須充分加以警戒也云云（士六日日聯電）</p>
<h3>南路前綫　意軍猛烈進攻　未獲顯著勝利　飛機十五架轟炸阿軍營</h3>
<p>阿京　活迦登之意軍今日復取攻勢、大隊索瑪里兵進攻薩薩巴尼東南四十哩之阿軍陣綫助以坦克車與武裝汽車、據今日午後接訊、雙方均未獲顯著之勝利、惟阿軍自　至少曾擊毀意軍武裝汽車八輛、並聞索馬里兵數白人曾逃降阿軍、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>意屬索瑪里倫摩迦狄斯西沃斯　今日此間接訊、意轟炸機十五架、今日飛至距杜洛西北一百五十哩之希奇里天空、低飛向阿軍營壘拋擲炸彈、逾兩小時之久、營中起火者過半、意機一架爲高射砲擊中拒動器、但該機仍安然飛回根據地、是役阿將台斯太之部衆死傷甚多云、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>哈拉爾　據此間今日所得可靠消息、大隊阿軍現正在阿尼爾韋爾斯集中、準備南向反攻沃迦登省、米格爾將軍之軍隊已與達加貝省省長薜發陸之軍隊聯絡、據悉阿皇已令　部司令那西蒲將軍親自率領云（十五日國民社電）</p>

<h3>美商部宣布　倫敦停止購銀理由　謂日人密運滬銀出口確甚活動　今後改向產銀國購買儘多市場</h3>
<p>華盛頓　美國商部今日所發表之期報中、已正式承認數月以來上海之現銀、確有異常之活動情形、且特別提出日人收買現銀、運往國外之活動、私人方面之專家亦以爲各國僑民私運現銀、實爲美國財部停止在倫敦購銀之一部份理由、例如此間得悉美國官塲對於十月及十一月中倫敦由日本運到之大批現銀、曾非常注意、因兩月中共運到價値五千一百萬日金之多、去年全年亦不過一千四百萬日金、且此項現銀運英之時、適在中國政府實施幣制新策之前云、（十五日國民社電）</p>

<h3>海军会议入第一週　日本改取攻势　期贯澈海军均等目的</h3>
<p>东京　軍縮會議第一委員會自十六日起减少各國出席人員構成幹部會、且因本週會議爲本年中最後會商其結果如何頗堪注目、上週開四决第一委員會一决日英私的會談、其結果　過得表示日英美數國主張之一部分意見而已、會議前途仍然暗淡、日本代表團對於第二週會議對策始終力謀徹底的軍縮之實現、主張共通最高限度之設定、說明日本主張之細項末節、是正各國誤解、而英美等如有提議停止討論量的問題、開始討論質的問題時、日本仍主張先行决定量的問題、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>伦敦　日代表團决定在本週會議中、積極探取攻勢態度、對於英美設定差別的兵力之理論加以反駁、使耶誕節前第一期會議有利於日、英國主張其有保護廣大版圖及通商要路之必要、與實行國聯及其他國際條的義務之必要而反對日本兵力平等之要求、日代表團反駁英國此項理論之根據如次、　脆弱性理論若在英帝國適用、則爲遠　中心國負有重大責任之日本、亦要適用同樣理論、　英國以其版圖之廣大、爲其脆弱性理論之根据、然廣大版圖便於作戰易得根據地反在戰術上佔優勢地位、　英國爲實行國際義务需要强力海軍、此可證明一旦有事之際、得他國協力、日本在遠東孤立維持和平斷不能承認此項提議（十六日日聯電）</p>

<p>纽约　紐约通信報對於日本在倫敦海軍會议中之態度表示焦慮、並指日本故意破壞保障中國土地與行政完整之九國公的、謂一九二一年華府會議不獨限制海上軍備、且亦解决牽涉太平洋與亞洲大陸之政治爭議、此點日本竟悍然漠視或掩飾之、九國公约　共同協定之一部、乃日本公然　壞之、今且開始其亞洲侵略之政業矣、一九二一年未能使海軍難題脫離政治今日依然如是、最可擾人者、不爲日本對於海軍同等原則之强頑主張、但爲日本在政治會議中通過其海軍圖案之成功耳、如日本必欲行破壞政，策、則西方諸國與其有一限制海軍之條的、不如無之但有一條的、而許日本噸數同等、則直承認日本在太平洋中始于阿拉斯加、止于澳洲之優越地位而已云、（十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>科學叢談　中國科學社主編　動物與人生（續）　秉志</h3>
<p>由動物學之廣義而言，人生之各種現象，亦爲此學所包含。人類本係動物之一，其所以首出庶物，爲世界之主人翁者，以其大腦特別發達，爲一切動物所不及，其能力遂超乎所有動物之上，有創造文化之天才，主持全球之勢力，演化數千萬年，遂成今日之世界。動物中有繁盛一時，在大地上最佔勢力，而因環境陡變，其體之構造，頗不相宜，其神經系統，尙未發達至完全程度，故其腦力不能對付環境而有餘，其生存上遂發生極大困難。環境之壓迫愈甚，此種動物之應付愈難，於是凡環境所有之關係，無一不與之有極大之危險，此種動物，勢必至於絕滅而後已。觀於古動物學中所討論之種類，其絕滅不傳於後者，不知凡幾，古昔之原人，其種類絕滅者亦甚多。然則無論何種生物，其能生存於今日者，必能善於應付環境者也。今日入類之競爭，日形劇烈，世界民族，有能力較遜，不能創造文化，組織强有力之國度，不幸與强橫之民族相接觸，乃竟任其侵掠殺戮，喪其土地，喪其天產，喪其自主之權力，喪其生存之機會，有爲人所征服奴役絕滅者。人類自相殘害之慘劇，反較各種動物爲尤甚，於是而知人類兇惡之性，與猛獸殊無差別。人類文明之進化，乃極形遲緩，今日之世界，仍未脫最初蠻僿之餘習也。民族之未曾開化，無創造文化之能力，是其資質原來太遜，未能與張族抵抗，而任其殄滅，亦不足怪。所最不可解者，卽數千年文化發達之民族，具有開創之成績。與他民族相遇，屢受摧挫，而竟不可復振，寖假禍逼眉睫，危亡將至，有不可終日之勢，此蓋緣其人民太無普通科學之知識，對於動物生存之現象，夢不之省故也。始由人民缺乏敎育，處今日國競方急之時代，凡獨立國民所需之性質知識技能，未曾陶鑄而成，故其麻木不關痛癢之積習，與只知自利，不顧國家之劣性，萬難適應今日之環境，屢受痛苦，而腐化之程度，亦與之俱深。此種人民，與最下等之動物，相去無幾，而其所遇環境之危險，乃千萬倍於下等動物，欲其免於天然之淘汰，其可得乎。然人類旣有此健全之腦，爲一切動物所不及，且能利用此健全之腦，創造文化，有數千年之歷史矣，苟善用其天賦之强，體察動物生存之現象，深思天演公例之不可逃，猛自覺悟，以自助自救乎。動物之中，若烏鴉水鴨等，皆有合羣之能力，烏鴉擇地取食，遷徙靡常，率結羣而往，每集一地，輙有專員司警吿之責。故羣鴉集合之時，有一二鴉瞭望四處，偶値敵害之將臨，必鳴警以覺其侶伴，冀免撲殺之慘禍，途中偶遇同伴受傷，不能飛行前進者，羣鴉必翼護周至，或儘力遷移於安全之地，以冀其復痊。水鴨亦喜結羣而處，每夜棲止水上，則共成一環，各鴨之足，互相攀牽，其頭向外，敵害一臨，必有一處先行發覺，一鴨驚動，羣鴨皆知，以此得保全其團體。有此種結羣之能力，其種類甚受其裨益，衰落不振之民族，不知愛護其同胞，受人利用，同類相殘者，當藉以爲鑒也。動物之中，如蜂類蟻類，皆有合作之能力，其團體之中，分工之制度，皆井井有條，有專司取食，以養其團體者，有專司營巢，安寞其團體者，有專司保衛，以護全其領袖，而抵禦外患者，有專司生殖，以綿延其種類者。每一專員，皆一心奉公，努力盡職，完全以團體之利害爲利害，而不自顧其私，其合作之精誠，甚爲發達，共種類遂能繁盛。腐化日深之民族，不知愛其國家，只知營私競利者，當對之自愧，幡然改悟者也。動物之中，如數種虫類，無自立之能力，惟恃寄生於他動物之體中，以圖生殖。結果寄生受其害，而寄虫之本身，大形退化，各種機關，漸行消失，將來退化至於何等程度，殊無止境。此種動物，永不能返於自立之地位，依賴性成之民族，不知奮發圖存，徒恃他人相助者，當取以自惕也。動物之中，如淺海數種魚類，春季天氣溫暖，羣集海濱，因爭雌而鬥，爭巢而鬥，或爭食而鬥，互鬥之極，斷腸决脰，破額抉睛，而斵其生命者，爲數至鉅。一旦鯊鯨驟至，巨喙箕張，盡量呑噬，無數同種相鬥，不可開交之份子，不旋踵同葬於敵人之腹中，而不自悟，勇於自戕之民族，惟知徇其私見，不顧大禍之當頭，敵害已窺堂奧，猶彼此相持，不肯稍休者，常覩此以自返也。動物不知互助者，其種必難生存，其能互助者，其種必可繁殖，此義達爾文嘗言之，克洛包的金氏言之尤詳。人為萬物之靈，其能役使一切動物者，以其腦部特別發達，可以結羣，可以互助，可以分工合作，可以獨立自謀生存，而創造發展世界之文化，宜更本其原來之優點，以自奮勵，利用各種動物，以爲富國裕民之資，更宜深明動物學之意義，靜觀各動物生存消長之現象，以策愛國愛種思想之發達。</p>

<p>紙墨筆硯，自古就　爲文房四寳。凡是讀書人，總都是備着文房四寳的。就是以屠沽起家的暴發戶，一旦新厦落成了，總也得僱一個備而不用的書房，配置　凈儿明窗，而請名家題上一個甚麼軒，甚　齋，以充風雅。旣有了甚麼軒，甚麼　，雖是目不識丁的，總也得置備一套十分考究的紙墨筆硯。雖然紙墨筆硯，在屠沽起家者？最多也不過登登靑菜三斤豆腐一百文等等伙食賬而已，絕對的不作別用，但若一個書房中而無文房四寳之設，那便將顯得主人的傖俗到了一百二十分。</p>
<p>但是到了這麼個一九三五年，或是一九三六年的年頭兒，任你是甚麼再也高貴不過的文房四寳，是不吃香了。除了專寫「等因」，「此」等公文的，書記先生，還不能與文房四寳絕緣之外，其餘的任何辦公桌上，都是代之以墨水和鋼筆鉛筆了。雖然辦的是中國的公事，寫一個「閱」字，或是批一個「准」字，也總是用紅鉛筆兒批註。若是用中國筆批註一下，準會給下屬笑掉了門牙，在背地裏說是鋼筆都把握不住的。商店中的「流水」，「謄淸」等等，倒還用着中國筆墨，可是「純粹華商的商業機關，便就用的是外國賬簿。至於靑年學生，除了國文的作文課，不得不勉强一用中國的紙墨筆硯之外，所用的，總是左上襟上的自來墨水筆和洋紙。文房四寳，到了今日，眞可說是日暮途窮，無怪乎紙鋪筆莊裏的老闆掌櫃，都是那麼的愁眉苦臉。</p>
<p>綫裝書雖被打倒，但現在又復興了，不知文房四寳的未來運命將如何？</p>
<h3>舞女的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 波光</p>
<p>在一個冬之夜，煤油燈射出了微弱的光芒。三個男子都異口同聲的嘆息伊不幸的遭遇！</p>
<p>據伊訴說：「在去年上海舞女羣裹，也可算得一個紅舞女，一月所得，開支家用，綽乎有餘。可是我本性不喜儲蓄，任意的揮霍一空。以後，在追求我的許多舞客中，和某君却發生了肉體關係，留下了孼障，停止了旋律，結果是被人遺棄了！」伊呷了一口茶又說：「上海的社會，我把它透視一下，什麼都給不景氣的氛圍困住了，獨有以色誘人，還有人自願終日沉醉在脂粉陣中。現在雖然到了非常國難期，它們何嘗不知？反正娛樂也可救國的。但是每决都買了來路貨的禮品來結懽，這眞是矛盾極了！」</p>
<h3>藥物治療</h3>
<p>三個男子都認伊是崇拜洋貨的人，却不知是一個有血性的女子。只怪伊不知儲蓄，現在只能住三間小屋，並且家中常常斷炊，眞是可憐極了！</p>
<p>桌上煤油燈的光芒更弱小了，萬物都和死去一般，有時還聽得狺狺的犬吠聲</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣姝集議　虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>他接着把胸脯子一挺，又道：我們若是要爲全婦女界求解放，我們就必得把眼面前這個不能自立的女子挽救起來。耍不然我們只管是口裹唱唱高調，疋讓人聽了笑話了。那爲了省事一點，從此以後，我們還是免開尊口罷。他說完了，還把他的高跟鞋子頓了一頓，表示他那分憤懣的意思。全塲的女人，這就鼓起掌來。北海看到，心裹這就想着，像這位女太，太那分激烈的樣子，那是可以壓倒賈多才的氣燄的。只是他這分打扮，好像這幾句話，是不應當由他嘴裏說出來，下文如何，倒是不能得知哩。只說到這裹，那個摩登女人已經坐下，另有一個中年婦人站了起來。他還不曾開口，四座的太太們，就都鼓起掌來，表示歡迎。北海看那態度，知道就是專員夫人。他道：旣然各位先生都贊成我的提議了，現在就推兩位當代表，去和那位買先生交涉。我們交涉的原則，第一是姓賈的要立刻恢復朱女士的自由。第二，朱女士恢復以後，我們設法和他找一分職業，賈先生不能再干涉他。他說着，四座的人，又劈劈拍拍鼓起掌來。他很得意的向大家望望。笑道：關於這件事，雖然問題很小，但是我想着，這也許是西安城裏婦女運動第一次表現，我們務必做到。若是有什麼困雖的話，我們藍專員可以相當的帮忙。在這種是非不明的社會裹，政治的力量，總是不可少的。他說着，又把眼珠轉着，向大家看看。這裏面有幾位女賓，是知道他的專員在這裹鬧過一次笑話的，這政治的力量，似乎不能再用。其中的周太太便笑道：我們還是靠我們自己罷。難道離開男子，我們就做不了事。藍夫人向他看了一看。便道：我不過是這樣一個建議，並不一定就照辦。現在我的話說完了，各位有什麼意見，馬上就說出來，不必再俄延時間了。他坐下去，還是先前那個女人站了起來。（三七八）</p>
<h3>讀蔣委員長五全大會對外宣言</h3>
<p>— 黃景汎</p>
<p>深謀無忝總師干，以此圖存信不刋，齊大未容盟夾谷，秦强且欲郡邯鄲，一擲侈談孤注易，百年積弱折衝難，聞道京華消息好，藺廉平勃盡交讙</p>
<h3>爲殷汝耕叛於冀東感賦</h3>
<p>— 黃景汎</p>
<p>白山轩水總成殘，又向幽燕煽揭竿，不羨　生能掉舌，劇憐叔　竟無肝，民心未必歸劉豫，天意何居育漢奸，成敗豈應關氣運，四維隳盡最心寒。（却酬）</p>
<h3>記所見</h3>
<p>— （喬耘飱）</p>
<p>江　翔殷路一帶，人行道左右，很多沒有塡平的小溝，跟着江潮升落，有些潮餘的細流慢慢地灌進來；這種呆水溝裹，一樣的有魚跳躍其間，可是爲數很少，附近平民，不是正式漁夫，或許沒有力量沒有機會做什麼苦工，隨便在這些溝裹捕了魚維持他們的生計；他們不用魚網，也不張大網，大概根本沒有置網的基金，然而雖缺乏一網打盡的有形網，却具着一網打盡的毅力，瞧見他們學着「愚公移山的方法，把二三丈的一條溝，分建兩座短短的泥閘，再把水一盆一勺的從甲溝輸送到乙溝，工作到細流漸竭，籠統的大魚，小魚，蝦呀，蟹呀，都做了「甕中之鼇」，據他們說：收穫雖然不算少，可是賣不起高價，呆水魚是有汚泥氣的，不上庖丁之手，不入精雅之簋，是不登大雅之堂的啊。</p>

<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>雨窗</h3>
<p>— 止水</p>
<p>又是一個陰沈的天氣，玻璃窗上，浮著一重重薄霧似的烘托着空際的瞑色，鄰居的汽車，都己開走了，去寫字間或是辦公室，靠着窗口望下去，只有兩三個買菜的娘姨，提着籃子，斷斷續續地過來，連那天天的早上抱了小孩子，在弄堂裏面溜來溜去的女人也不見了，像是爲了寒冷吧，弄堂中的空氣，死寂一般，再也發現不出甚麼。金先生拿起鋼筆來重又擱下，無量數的迷憫，籠罩了他的心頭，恰和這天氣一樣，他想寫點東西，稿完了，應當給人家送去的，而且自己對於這次的創作狠感到興趣，但怎的這一剎那之間，竟集中不起心思來呢？</p>
<p>「書房是智識勞動者的牢獄，滿意的吻是中年人最大的安慰，」金先生噓了一口氣，在不斷地念着這兩句，懷疑自已，他要克服自己的矛盾，偉大的人生，不是躱避現實，也不僅抓住現實，而是要打破了現實才換得新的生命力，這生命力的活躍，將給予你們以會心的微笑，由現實的紛碎，到現實的創造，每一個人都該擔負起這使命來，這才是有意義的人生，關閉在書房裹面，和憧憬着吻的陶醉，那只是柔弱的心靈之一瞥，它會幻滅了你堅强的意志啊！中年人有浩人生的實際體騐，比靑年還要健全勇敢，方是，金先生又這樣想着事實告訴給人們，中年人多半是弱者，他受了少壯的創傷，和衰老的襲擊，這二重的恐怖，咬着他賸餘下來的一半希望的心，這就生長了怯懦的根。就說自己，雖己三十九歲了，模樣以及精神，都還比得上靑年，允其是邁往的氣概，常常比十幾歲的孩童還要强，但回憶使得他動搖，生活使得他抑鬱，允其是身體使得他覺着無論怎樣好，總不及自己在十幾歲的時候，不像中年人而又不能不是中年人的感想，至少不能完全離開一切的中年人而獨立的感想，都使金先生又在書房裏踱來踱去地念那兩句話。</p>
<p>打開報紙看，華北的形勢又在緊張了，漢奸？浪人，是一是二，簡直分別不出來，但政府能怎樣呢？打仗吧，算是打勝了，誰的勝利呢？大衆的嗎？不是的。民族和國家的勝利嗎？那末帝國主義者的國家他們得過多少决的勝利。又是怎樣？可是站在民族的立塲，又不能屈服。金先生慨嘆了，「管它吧，」滿意的吻，是中年人最大的安慰，但何處去獲得這滿意的吻呢？僅僅是色慾的刺激，而沒有靈的共鳴，當然不能認做滿意的，這靈的共鳴，更是談何容易，看窗外時，一滴滴的雨點又來了，壁間的掛鐘，可可噹噹地響了十二下，又該吃午飯的時候了，還是去寫稿子吧。這似安定而又不安定的生活，桎梏了每一個中年人的心靈，「書房是智識勞動者的牢獄，滿意的吻，是中年人最大的安慰，」金先生，放下了報紙，父念起來一面走向靠牆的另一隻桌上，端起了茶壺，接連地喝了好幾口濃極了的玫瑰紅茶後，攤好了稿紙，去吃中飯。</p>

<h3>南星演出驚人局面　海賊苦戰得勝</h3>
<p>最後三分鐘海賊轉敗爲勝</p>
<p>恊興勝約翰悄緒亦甚緊張</p>
<p>西靑籃球咋賽、南星對海賊一塲、竟演成驚人之局面、南星表演、突見振作、一路在前領導、上半時打成二十五對二十三、下半時南星一度以三十三對二十五、遙佔上風惜不能堅持到底、於最最後三分錡、始爲海賊超出、結果海賊以五九對叫十六獲勝、另一塲協興以五十六對三十六勝約翰、上半時競爭亦烈、的翰以十九對十八佔先、乙組賽西靑以四十二對十八克猶太、今晚秩序如下、七時一刻　麥令對同文　乙組八時正　東　對曁南　甲組</p>
<p>海賊勝來不易</p>
<p>甲組賽第一塲、南星對海賊、南星主將劉景峯及鐘士模、因月考關係缺席、在陣錢殘缺之下、全隊奮發有爲、動作猛捷、聯絡亦佳、打來有聲有色、周怒安與陳文鍔兩鋒、在敵籃下穿來穿去、球到手中、隨手擲去、莫不命中、表演之佳、得未前見、海賊在此種情形之下、鋒芒全斂、祗能在後追隨、惜至最後三分鐘、南星因體力不繼、致將可勝之局面斷送、殊爲可惜、比賽開始時、南星即先發</p>
<p>先發制人　比賽開始時、南星即先發九對六、十一對八、後卡遜兩度投中、海賊一度以十二對十一超出、但是南星聲勢正盛、周怒安陳文鍔兩鋒投籃如有神助、先後連取四球、海賊又告落後、繼成二十一對十四、萊恩連加兩球後、因眼部受傷出塲、海賊鼓勇力追、上半時打成二十五對二十三之比、南星以兩分佔先、</p>
<p>雖敗猶榮　下半時中、萊恩上塲僅一分鐘又告退、史密斯板下探藍、打成二十五平手、但轉瞬間、南星又形得勢、一氣呵成八分頓成三十三對二十五、海賊亡命奮鬥、史密斯、卡遜、大顯身手、速罰帶擲、又造成二十五平手、周恕安命中後、而史密斯亦以遠射告中、又成三十七對三十七、此爲最緊張時期、海賊打來漸入佳境、忽以四十二對三十七超出、南星力追、又成四十二對四十二、斯時僅餘三分鐘、南星體力不繼、防守不週、遂爲海賊所乘、局勢急轉直下、最後結果、成九十九對四十六、</p>

<p>約翰敗於協興</p>
<p>最後一塲協興對的翰、上半時競爭亦甚劇烈、的翰由許文奎打開紀錄、協興以七對二超出、但入後協興打來慌亂不堪、傳遞毫無鵠的、後衛又疏於防備、的翰鼓勇力爭、許文奎益得心應手、會造成十二對七之比、協興由周達雲連進數球、浪成十四平手、未幾又成十九對十四、徐亨、丘廣爕連加兩球後、而上半時即告終、的翰以一分佔先、下半時之局勢忽形改變、協興光芒四射、分數扶搖直上、約翰卒以三十五對五十六慘敗、　協興　擲罰犯分周達雲十一二三徐亨七二〇十六丘廣燮　四一一九張錦祥　三一三七翁仁安　〇〇一○陳宗祺一一二三</p>

<p>眞如復旦改期　眞如對復旦之中華會甲組杯複賽、原定今日在申園交鋒、無如昨日風雨竟日、塲地積水甚多、不堪應用、决定改期至十九日（本星期四）下午三時仍在原塲舉行、</p>
<p>上週聯賽結果　中華足球會上週四塲聯賽、結果因遠在郊外、常日未及收齊報告故於今日補誌如下、</p>
<h3>西聯足球會　甲組最近局面</h3>
<p>——並談談上週各塲情勢——</p>
<p>昨星期六日兩天、西聯足球會中數塲高級比賽、均充滿興趣而引人興奮、葡萄牙之僅勝臘克期一球、優游之以六比五死裹逃生、英尼斯之以四比零擊敗西捕、無一非經劇烈之競爭、而東華對法之史高塔杯賽、允爲球迷所注目、以法商陣容之不振、使東華以三比一獲勝、而大華特之缺席、派克之負傷作戰、爲法商重大打擊、</p>
<p>曾擊敗東華之葡萄牙隊、僅與五比四克服臘克斯、比數之接近、殊非始料所及、臘克斯前週曾敗於向稱老弱平庸之西商隊、彼與葡萄牙之戰、竟一洗病弱之態、幾令人判作兩隊矣、其奮勵努力之精神、良可嘉許、此種結果、足使往後之聯賽、增加興趣、而使仟何一隊、不敢輕敵大意也、</p>
<p>西商自前次擊敗其舊敵臘克斯後、令人括目相看、租葡萄牙可稱為本季中興之球隊、昨星期日與優游戰於逸園、西商始終佔居極佳形勢、但優游以不斷的努力、卒以六比五出水火而登衾席、西商之敗、誠不勝憐惜、故比賽雖少精彩、局勢始終緊張興奮、</p>
<p>英尼斯乃一中庸之球隊、初不料能戰勝前决淘汰優游之西捕、更不料以四比零之巨大比數而獲勝、由此可知西捕將以全力對付史高塔杯、而忽視聯賽、蓋本屆西捕實力衰弱、不得不出之下策也、</p>
<p>史高塔杯賽東華淘汰法商後、前途去一障得矣、法商前以華特昆仲之努力、與東華搆成三三和局、昨次重　、大華特反作座上客、而中堅主將派克上塲不久即負創、蹺其一足、免强作戰、終不出於一敗也、東華之勝、固自有其强固陣綫、但表演平平、徒興少年老朽之憾、欲圖保持錦標、後此之賽、則非努力不可、甲組聯賽最近形勢如下、</p>
<h3>上海籃球會　昨開幕賽五場結果</h3>
<p>上海籃球會昨晚私上中對國光作揭幕賽、雙方實力堪稱伯仲、戰情始終緊張、上中一路上風、至時間將完時、被國光一投一罰、造成二十三對二十三之平手、延長再戰、上中初則依然順色、惟好景不常、在最後一分鐘內、國光遠射連着、以二十九對二四反敗為勝、</p>
<p>商工對中社之七四部賽、爲昨最精采之一幕、全局演成平手者凡五度、足證常時掙扎之猛烈、中社之失敗、是前鋒不注意新規則之三秒鐘、致援對隊進攻機會耳、結果被商工以十九對十六之比告捷、阜豐對法軍、勝來雖易、而阜豐球員之動作頗為特異、將始終頑抗之法軍、打得莫知所措、亦値得濟意者、茲將五塲結果誌之如左、</p>
<h3>鐵城盃籃球賽　女子組啓秀幸勝華東</h3>
<p>籃球房漏雨球員大翻觔斗</p>
<p>華東之失敗其因亦中於此</p>
<p>鐵城盃籃球賽、昨日共有男女乙組四塲、因天雨終朝、籃球房漏水、地板受濕者亦有四五處之多、球員裁判員均似脚底加油、大翻觔斗、總計四塲常有百餘决左右、對比賽機會大有出入、按籃球房新建未久、其建築之宏大、譽爲遠東獨步、今受小雨、竟致漏水、能不令人駭異、希望工程師從速修理、吾則受濕地板、再經乾濕、恐有高低不平之虞、惟昨日各塲比　精神極佳、力隊因受挫於法學院、動作言語、稍嫌過火、務望以運動道德為重、勿介介於勝負也、華東啟秀之戰、雙方競爭劇烈、華東上塲以范紫紋陸翠芳滑跌受傷、鋒衝失力、影響全局、上半時啟秀以十二比七佔先、下半時華東努力反攻、以七與六之比小勝、但結算總賬、啟秀仍以十九比十四獲勝、今日社光與輔誼之戰、因社光耍求改期、故僅兩塲、昨賽結果西藏勝　民（乙三）四十比十三粵東勝同德（乙二）三十比二十一法學院勝力隊（乙一）二十八比十六啟秀勝華東（女乙）十九比十四</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（二）（六）</h3>
<p>— 鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「我的可憐的小姑娘，不要哭！現在你一切已安全了，今晚再沒有人來責罵你的了，」蜀夫人說道，同時放南恩在她寬大的的懷抱裏，緊撫着兩個孩子，好像一個母雞集合她的既失去的羣雛在她的卵翼之下。「這是我的過失，不過我確已懊悔了。我想要好好照管他，所以把他遮起來，讓他睏去，也不碰他的苺實，雖然我是飾物得很。呀；我以後决定永世不再做，——眞的永世不做了，永世不做了，」南恩哭泣着，她在充滿了悔罪與感恩交流的情緒中，迸發出這一番話來。</p>
<p>「現在去呌他們，讓我們回家去罷，」蜀夫人說道；於是唐恩，去立在牆上把，「打到了」這個歡樂的消息，震響於大草原的處處。</p>
<p>於是各處游散的燈火都搖曳前來，圍攏了香鳳尾草矮樹又不裏的小集團。接着有擁抱，親吻，談話，甚至感泣，熱閙得不亦樂乎，大螢不勝驚奇，蚊虫也芬明喜悅，它們鳴鳴嗡，達於狂熱的程度，還有小蛾也成羣結隊而來，相與慶賀，奇蛙競作鴉鴉之聲，震耳欲聾，然而好像尚不足表達其中心的歡忭。</p>

<h3>美資本家避稅售出股票</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、（十四日）紐的股市平呆、多種股票微升、但投機家以歐人獲利出籠、及資本家避稅售出、都呈觀望、市面暫時或將受雜糧之變態影響、債市與小交易所股票漲落互見、半日成交六十七萬股、道瓊斯紐的指數列左、</p>
<h3>紗花　同業發揮威力　紗花皆跌　金融界吸收之額始終不放</h3>
<p>紗市續趨下落、跌風益甚、良以海外棉業狀况不穩、兼之本埠存紗較前增加、而同業中一致傾向拋賣、本月份交貨充足、故壓力殊强、惟金融界吸收之額、始終不放、金業都大半尚未出籠、四十二支綫價狂跌五元外、</p>
<p>各月大都進二百元關　標紗前市各月一致但盤、因美棉復入疲途、大阪三品紗除本月外、一齊敲破二百元關門、致人心愈形疲乏、頭盤開出均跌一元五·六角、二三盤四無變動、益昶·長豐補空、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌九角至一元一·五角、午後開盤仍屬平淡無勁、市塲交易異常冷靜、通成·通記多頭略有出檔、市盤步步下落、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五。六角、查賣出大孚一千三百包、通記七百包、恒益一千四百五十包、大豐八百五十包、達記九百包、泰興六百五十包、長餘六百五十包、元一六百包、慎記七百五十包、潤康一千二百包、買進梅記一千包、錦昌一千六百包、愼記六百包、仁豐六百五十包、益昶一千零五十包、長豐一千三百包、新華九百包、振大六百包、泰昌五百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>現紗銷路轉滯、查全日各帮買去統計六百七十四包、行情跌二元、綫跌五元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市近月因外商依然收貨、市態較挺、惟遠月受外棉不振之影響而鬆懈、美棉現貨、重復打破一角二分關口、印棉趨勢益覺軟化、但信誠長和通記梅記等多頭仍不放出云、標花前市開盤、各月</p>
<p>散布謠言支持一時　標花前市開盤、各月一齊下跌、且局勢尤虛、以美棉無力、現貨一角二分關口、重復打破、印棉亦不佳、因此賣氣略盛、各月在落四五角、拍至二盤、市上發現捕風捉影之談、謂外棉進口有增稅之謠傳、近月跳起二角、三盤平平、結果各丹比上日收盤價跌二角至四角半、惟本月勿動、午後開盤平平、二三盤以上日之傳說、全屬不確、人氣轉鬆、結果各月比上午收盤價跌一角至一角半二角、查賣出昶記一千擔、通記二千三百擔、大豐三千四百擔、達記一千八百擔、賽豐一千擔、大昌成一千擔、長豐一千一百擔、潤康三千三百擔、生源一千二百擔、同和一千四百擔、游興昌三千二百擔、愼記一千九百擔、長和一千五百擔、買進裕康二千八百擔、合興三千七百擔、昶記一千九百擔、益昶三千九百擔、益康二千五百擔、長和二千擔、生源一千七百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>本棉存底均有增加</h3>
<p>十二月十三日調查</p>
<h3>印美棉進出統計</h3>
<p>孟買週初因美棉報告利於多頭、市况活動、旋以美棉市價低落、亦形不振、廠商雖有大批限價買進、塲中多頭了結及出口商之套賣額亦不少、業外需要平淡、內地走動不旺、蓋棉農對於目前市價、不願脫手、欲於最近期間、冀得較佳之價也、輸出商因契的關係、尚形活動、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>糧食　洋麥報跌　粉麥暴落</h3>
<p>幾失自主能力　浮多又皆束手　小麥準備交割</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後一致猛落、因洋來報價、芝加哥跌叫分至一角五角不等、坎拿大互有叫分之上落、市塲人心、因洋麥略回、業外浮多、大部分停　、獲利者逐有回脫、致形勢暗淡、近遠期計回跌三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、交易突轉淸淡、大戶及一部分廠方、未見續收、且年關結束已近、客戶均思了結、是以市面又落一分左右、上下午之跌度、與前週相較、則達五分左右之巨云、</p>
<p>麥市各月份一致回跌甚暴、本月份因距交割日近、聞空頭方面、將凖備交貨、惟貨品以漢口來者占多數、色澤未能高潔、故廠　不合、業外更無收藏之可能、是以回跌更見猛烈、達一角六分之巨、遠期各月份、交易未暢、吸戶不多、又因洋麥轉軟、一月份以下、亦跌八九分不等、現麥市面、因標準回跌甚猛、高决各檔、亦减低近角、開山東麥四元八角四分、丹陽麥四元七角八分、揚州麥四元七角八分、天台麥四元七角、計一千七百包、由福新辦去云、</p>
<p>國外小麥、據稱阿根廷小麥之最低價等於七角三分而非九角、計算之混亂、乃因進出口滙兌受政府編統制、差額甚鉅而起　據最後報告、謂出口價等於九角、衆認有興奮效力、惟買戶願吾隨漲買進、略有可疑耳、芝加哥小麥十三日　十四日</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>誰是敵國</h3>
<p>— 羊羽</p>
<p>曾替塘沽協定竭力作護，主張不抵抗的胡適之先生，近來也爲了華北五省有分割的危險，心中也大感不安起來，寫了一篇評論「敬告日本國民」，寄到日本的「日本評論」上。（據胡先生說這題目是室伏高信氏出的。）文中第一點是：「十分誠摯的懇求日本國民不要再談「中日親善」。第二點是：「請日本國民不要輕視一個四億人口的民族的仇恨心理。」意思是「蜂躉尙有毒」，何况四億人民的仇恨？以後胡先生觀察到：「日本軍人的侵略野心是無止境的。滿洲不够，加上了熱河；熱河不够，延及了察哈爾東部；現在的非戰還不够作緩衝地帶，整個華北五省又都有被分割的危險了。」最後胡先生敬告日本國民「苦海無邊，回頭是岸。」雖是敬告，語氣不免帶了一些哀求，彷彿得去的地方得去就是了，現在不要再過來了！」</p>
<p>自從這篇文章在日本發表以後，據室伏高信氏的答復胡適之書中說：「知識階級，引起了很大的感動，對你（指胡適）發行了異常的稱讚，而對貴國則發生莫大的同情。」不論這是不是日本人眞的感動和發行同情（或許一部份日本國民會發生同情。）但是胡先生這篇文章，我以為還是白用心思的。因為室伏高信說「至少日本的知識份子是了解的，並且對你這種悲痛的告白，不禁同情。」這悲痛端上的同情，怎能敵得過「帶甲的拳頭」的兇狠呢？</p>
<p>因了胡先生的文章，同時也引起了室伏高信氏的帶有警告語氣的復信：「不要受不列顚的誘惑。」更希望具體的喚起貴國指導者們的注意。中國的敵人，是日本還是英國？應該是日本，還是應該英國？</p>
<p>誰是敵國呢？事實擺在人前，破壞國家完整，阻止人家的發展，這是敵對呢還是友愛？別人的誘惑，果然該注意，但是那種露骨的侵略，是不是比誘惑要好！我想任你怎樣的說法或掩飾，事實終究是事實。</p>
<p>本來一個完整的國家，沒有人來侵佔，就也沒有人敢來誘惑的，要想別人不來誘惑，最好自己不去侵佔人家，承室伏高信警告我們不要受不列顚的誘惑，本是很感激的，原該接受的，但是有人警告我們不要受日本的割裂啊！我們是不是就不管呢？况且事實又擺在面前。其實，誰是敵人的問題很節單的，是破壞完整，阻止發展的對方就是敵人！室伏高信問句，只見其虛心和卸責於人，移動人家的仇恨心理罷了。欲蓋彌張，我以爲室伏高信的復信，雖則很狡滑，其實還是笨拙呢。</p>
<h3>「雷雨」</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>——復旦劇社第十九次公演</p>
<p>作者：曹禺（原作刋於文學季刋一卷三期）</p>
<p>導演：歐陽予倩地點：寗波旅滬同鄉會</p>
<p>關於「雷雨」原作的評價，早已有些人讀過，就是這次演出的先後罷，還是有好多人談到這些，是的，當每一個劇本發表的時候，當一個戲搬上舞臺的時候，我們是沒有權力能够不得他的主題如何的，因之，當「雷雨」在上海第一决和觀衆見面的現在，我們還是沒有權力因爲已經有人談過而不讀。</p>
<p>我們先來看曹禺先生的寫作態度。</p>
<p>曹先生據說易一位淸華大學的敎授，他的生活形態如何我們也就不難從這一點上想像出來，他看出同他一階級者的腐爛墮落，無可救藥然而在他筆下的紳士少爺們，他可還是用同情來寫的，他雖是寫他們的腐化墮落，可是他們還是向光明，向「人」的路上掙扎，二少爺（周冲）大少爺（周萍）都不失爲一個好人，就是那位老爺（周樸園）罷，作者最後還是使他受不了良心的譴責，回復過了些「人」性。而那位並不是紳士少爺的魯貴呢，作者可祗是給了他卑鄙懦怯。這些由於作者本身的生活形態所决定，無意識地流露了出來。</p>
<p>當然，我的意思並不是說作者的這樣寫作態度的不對，我並不希望作者把魯貴寫成一個好人，也並不希望作者把周家的老爺少爺寫成使觀衆切齒痛恨的人物；我的意思祇是想說，由於生活形態，决定了每個人的意識形態，卽使並不下意識的，它還是無法不流露出來。</p>
<p>所以，我們對於作者把每個人的意識形態由他們的生活形態來决定，那是非常的對的，這兒由於各個生活形態的不同，（卽使是最相近的周冲和周萍罷，也因爲他們所處的時代不同，而有所不同）他們的意識形態也有所不同起來，周冲和周萍是不同的，可是周萍和樸園可更不同，至於魯大海，那自然更不同了，我們再來看侍萍，四鳳和繁漪，也是由於這個决定，他們是不會使的，感到錯誤起來。</p>
<p>眞的，作者的最大的勝利，也就是在這一點，劇中人的對白，你可以聽他們說些什麼就可以斷定那是誰說的，他不會把大海說的使係以爲是周冲說的，</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>他也不會把周萍說的使係以為是周冲說的，這種微妙，地方的成功，就是本劇最大的成功。——這樣作者不僅使每個角色有他的典型，並且是使每個角色都有了個性。</p>
<p>至於在結構上的緊凑，那還是餘事。</p>
<p>這次在演出上，歐陽予倩先生是把原作稍稍有些增删的，删的部份，佷容易使我記起來的，是那個「白頓宮女閒話說玄宗」式的「序幕」和「尾聲」，那除了使觀眾可知道些繁漪和侍萍兩個兒都成了瘋子之外，旁的便不少些什麽（這樣的删法，在演出上是反而會增加些力量，我以為。）增的部份呢，我記不大清楚（看戲之後我還不曾把那劇本重新翻過，）不過把大海這一個角兒先使他走他的光明大道，那一點暗示是增加得對的。至少，它使原作是增加了些啟示，减少了此感傷的氣氛。</p>
<p>導演的手法呢，也頗細膩，（原作上對人物的個性有很詳盡的說明，這一點我想一定給導演獲得有少帮助）特別是空氣製造得頗好，在在抓住了觀眾的情感，這一點是非常難得可喜的。</p>
<p>演員們，大部份都非常稱職盡力，使這個戲樣加了效果不少，比較差一點的，除了飾僕人的日文君戲根本太少之外，是李麗蓮女士的繁漪，她在第二幕裏，有幾個動作是使戲好像一頓（例如她的獨白：「好，一切仇恨我的人都來吧，之後）接着使戲　了　來，不過　在大體上她還是演得很不差的。</p>
<p>佈景，燈光，以及音響效果都很好，前兩都很能顯出一間陰沉沉的難得見陽光的大屋子，後者在第三四幕裏的打雷，閃電，以及胡琴聲，都處理得很好。</p>
<p>在演出上大槪談到這樣就為止。（為了篇幅，祇好這麽短短的寫一點兒）接着，我想談談「雷雨」在這次演出上的客觀效果，和他的社會價値。</p>
<p>「雷雨」將收到怎樣的客觀效果呢？這個，由於劇本的决定，我們似乎可以大胆的下這樣的一個武斷：因為「雷雨」的劇本是祗做到暴露為止，（雖然是已有了些改删）所以它的客觀效果也祗是使人感到一切罪惡都是由於社會組織所促成的，（由於原作者對周家的同情，這一點是更容易感到）而旣成之後，紳士之家因為禮敎道德的種種牽制，不得不依舊套着虛偽的面具。第二點呢，就是因為社會組織的畸形，一切罪惡都出諸於紳士之家。</p>
<p>在客觀環境限制下，我們如果不過份苛求，這樣的戲自然已不能不說一聲好，不過當「五四精神」正常「復活」的今日，身處北京的原作者，眼見到（說不定還是親歴）這次轟轟烈烈的大運動，是應該有比這再進步的劇本給我們的。</p>
<p>話已經說得太多，現在就帶住最後得聲明的，是，我所看的是第二天的夜塲戲。總計起來，是第四塲。</p>
<h3>愛</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>我家一個被家庭的愛禁錮着的孩子。</p>
<p>祖父的年紀已經六十多歲了，但是鬍髭是剛剛留下來的，他不願任何人說他年紀老了，或者年紀老了相類似的話。他自己認為還年青。早晨，他先刦來了，比別人都早。那時，天也不過剛剛亮，穿着笨拙的棉鞋柝柝地在地上走着，從最前的院落起，到最後的院止，他都挨着走一遍，在每一個門前咳聲嗽，帶着警告意味的走開去。</p>
<p>在他走後，各個屋子的門都「呀」的聲敝開。接着就是祖父掃院子的聲音。那比我高出一尺來長的竹掃帚，嘩嘩地掃着地，像一個老頭子咳嗽似的。</p>
<p>當然，我也就起來了，隨了母親，哥哥。</p>
<p>離學校很遠，那是我們縣城里唯一一處的這校，用過去的「明倫堂」改的。全校的學生的名字可以完全記得。而我的學行分數總都是甲等，連我最不高興上的「體操」也是甲等。因為我是一個「好學生」。每學期的前三名好像給我留着似的，總有我的份。他們一方面稱讚我的祖父的治家有方，而且時常詢問曾在「北京大學」畢過業，而今敎書的叔叔的最近情况。總之，他們對於我的家有着極好的印象。對於我，當然不會怎樣壞了。</p>
<p>我到這個學校去，是同一位年紀已經十五六歲的表哥去的。</p>
<p>表哥的年紀大了，懂得許多我所不知道的事。他知道怎樣用：一個銅板去買女孩子的歡喜，他也知道怎樣偷祖母的錢。對於這些事情我全然是外行。我也不懂。他也不要我懂。他每天等待祖母不在屋里的時候就叫我在門口張望，他去偷錢。我也就照辦。祖母是疼愛外甥的，當然不會深究。拿來錢以後，就買一點東西送給那一個他認為漂亮的女孩子。</p>
<p>他對於那女孩子似乎很要好。每當祖父出去，家人都在　屋里作事的時候，也就頷她到我們的那座　樹木和菜蔬的園子里去。在那里摟抱着，親熱着。</p>
<p>祖父知道了這事情。他把我叫去，在我的手心里，肚皮上，生殖器上，畫了些花紋。這一切我不明白。我眞不懂為什麽要這樣作，去問母親，母親只說不要亂弄水，泥不要弄掉，弄掉祖父會打的，而且將要不給錢化。去問表哥，表哥只是笑，說：「這有什麽關係呢？弄掉了再給畫一，一點關係也沒有！」於是我又和他在一塊玩了。</p>
<p>晚上，祖父從街上回來，把我叫去，看看我的花紋沒有了。身上的也模糊了。於是，他摸着他的短短的鬍髭，向我嚴肅地擺着臉問：「誰弄去的？」我搖搖頭，輕聲的說：「不知道。」</p>
<p>當然，這很使他不高興，幸而祖母解釋說：「白天帮助作活弄掉了！」他才不加細究。但是，他却知道了我作活，便派我許多工作，在十歲不到的我，是很感到「吃不消」的。而那花紋却依舊帶着，而且隨時隨地受着檢查。好像這花紋和我有着莫大的關係似的。我問母親，母親還是那樣說，問表哥也這樣。但是，是我求他解釋的時候，他都給我說了：</p>
<p>「他怕你摟抱女孩子，懂嗎？」　他們是在愛我呢。他們要把我變成叔叔那樣，每天每天去讀書，將來成一個「學問家。」於是，一個不滿十歲的小孩子受到了這種刑罰似的愛。</p>
<p>每當去學校之前，他總照例地在我的身上記下那些花紋。</p>
<p>然而對於表哥，却表示冷淡。祖父說：</p>
<p>「那是人家的孩子，我們不管！」</p>
<p>受着管理的孩子，舊劇的科班中的孩子似的，在行動上，都按照着規則。我不敢去活動：怕弄沒了那花紋。但是，體操不上也可以拿八十分以上的，因為叔叔，祖父的地位。</p>
<p>但是我在這愛里什麽也得不到發展。</p>
<h3>河畔</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>冬天。</p>
<p>日子顯然的沉鬱着。——</p>
<p>正午過不多時，城頭的碟雉上只不過留住得些黃昏的夕照吧了。</p>
<p>（在人們的記憶囅邊，這兒的黃昏是挺美麗的。春天，我們可以看見落日溫情地露出嫵媚的豐儀，那麽輕佻地偎着古城；夏天，城頭獨步，夕陽的那半裸的豐腴的胴體，準會敎你受了什麽誘惑似的，起了不寗靜的跳動；或者是在明媚的秋日里，……。可是，當日子一墮入於冬天的寒冰中，便又是那樣的沉鬱着。</p>
<p>（早上，看見萎頽的草上的露珠兒，在金黃色的陽光里邊笑得那麽輕盈，冬天以來，唯一的朗快的日子吧。</p>
<p>（但，到了黃昏，又是如往常一樣的沉沉地了。）</p>
<p>繞着古城，是生滿野草的斜坡。</p>
<p>斜坡下面的，却是那碧玉色的一道小河流。</p>
<p>小河潺湲地流着。載着沉重的歲月，緩緩地滑過去，滑過去。臉也縐了，還是不知羞地呢喃着舊時的情話。</p>
<p>岸上呢，人們的混亂的語聲，秋夜的蟋蟀似的，東一起，西一起，談着與他們沒點兒關係的議論。</p>
<p>項嘮叨的是那看管對面鐵路貨棧的路警，那是個臉孔有點像貓頭鷹的中年人，他的話匣子一打開，就老半天也不見關　的。</p>
<p>「媽的，難道這樣還有王法麽？，動不動就殺起人來，媽的，　公兒那傢伙眞不是東西，……」</p>
<p>又說着那些為人所聽厭的老套兒·</p>
<p>這時，船埠邊的那隻小船裏，那靈慄人的心魄的哭聲又浮在水面了。間中且雜着一大串的穢褻的詛咒。</p>
<p>誰都會這樣說的：</p>
<p>「新做了寡婦的春卿嫂實是太傷心啊。」</p>
<p>陽光狡猾地隱沒了。天是漸漸地陰暗下去。岸上那貨械關起太門。人也冷落了</p>
<p>冷的風流蕩着。掠過的河面，「噓」的一聲，溜到岸上來啦。</p>
<p>道旁的老掦樹，捅向蒼空的樹枝顫抖着。像個虔誠的敎士，跪着，張開雙手，為人們為自空冀求幸福似的。</p>
<p>沒有人聲。悄然有點兒可怕的模樣呢。</p>
<p>靜哪。</p>
<p>不久，街燈也吐出敎人想起老年人憲病時的恐怖的光茫了。</p>
<p>孤寂地矗立在城北的高塔，給暮靄經乘籠住，濛濛的情味，戀人的溫柔的眼珠子一般地可愛呵。</p>
<p>小河緩緩地流着。</p>
<p>輕微的歌唱，是悒　的丁香花樣的風味的小夜曲吧。</p>
<p>古城的龐大的紫影投在河面上。小河的　柔的腰肢，却消失在遠方的模糊裏邊。</p>
<p>靜的河。靜的城。靜的黃昏。</p>
<p>靜呵。靜呵。寂靜的沉鬱着的冬日呵。</p>
<p>然而，那女人的哭聲又繼續起來了。……</p>

<p>程方舟李蓮蓀毛家書</p>
<p>華美（一〇六〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「離婚」</p>
<p>奇聞艷事每荒唐。話到離婚興更在。堂上法官眞難做。衡情度理費思景。要曉得，女嫁男婚處處有。百年偕老祝相莊。畫眉是應學張京兆。舉案須能効孟梁。新婚典禮更隆重。華堂賓客喜洋洋。但見得，喜軸幢聯滿壁掛。燈燭輝煌繞禮堂。興高采烈排盛宴。舉杯同祝兩鴛鴦。愛河淸凈無塵俗。那知道，忽起波瀾暗自傷。昨日夫妻今日敵。法庭相見喊寃枉。男女親朋多疑惑。介紹人傳喚到公堂。理由是，發育未全難如願。全無性慾誤嬌娘。閨房之內無樂趣。望法官，斷即離婚莫相强。法官聽。問端詳。回轉頭來問新郞。那曉得，新郞是，無言無語無主張。問家長。無法想。不反對。沒商量。好端端，折散了兩鴛鴦。反羨現今社會裏。自由戀愛當家常。社交公開無秘密。同出同游在影戲塲。熱度高。情慾張。意合情投兩相忘。免得離婚話短長。儘管先行把交易做。何妨擇吉再開張。大家用情須專一。卿卿我我樂無疆。不過是，情塲難好多荊棘。孽海情天兩渺茫。夫唱婦隨最風光。</p>
<p>夏荷生三笑</p>
<p>敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇「玉蜻蜓訪母」</p>
<p>元宰公子解元郞。尋蹤訪跡爲爹娘。七里山塘行將半。但見紅榆秋色强。金風漸漸梧桐落。又見籬邊菊花黃。曾訊得。鹿鳴晏罷歸來轉。不覺，過了中秋桂花香。但見有花須飲酒，重陽沉醉又何妨。想通衢大道多混雜。還是，小街僻巷到幽藏。我想繼父當年遊此地。莫不是，花移月媚在菴堂。早難道，尼僧失却空門戒。難道我，繼父爲色誤寒窗。你看那，紡織勤工在小巷內。還有那，繡女桃花窈窕娘。拈蔴績際多勞苦。秋收熟稻巳登塲。行來巳抵菴門近。見小弄堂，一帶是粉紅牆。但是那。鶯啼雁落多佳趣。楓葉初黃賽錦妝。蒼松翠柏深秋景。此乃是，幽室焚修的靜佛堂。風吹秀竹颼颼饗。雲外孤鴻陣陣行。石花街，微雨初晴塵不染。茱藤藤繞木香棚。但只見，兩扇竹門惟緊閉。惡犬須防寫粉牆。慢觀外面深秋景。且叩菴門往內廂。未知母姨今可在菴堂。</p>

<h3>「上海」牌國貨冰淇淋「桃花夢」</h3>
<p>下期在金城公映</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 云爾</p>
<p>某報載，「白玉霜爲什麼要拍願戲？」統一藝術社的主持人發表他們的緣起說。「白玉霜在上海恩派亞戲院登台，中下階級的人差不多都去看過她的戲了，現在要吸收上等階級的人，不能不呌她拍影戲，因爲影戲可以在高等戲院開映的，呌有身價的人看戲，不能不先謀環境方面的舒適。</p>
<p>記得從前有一句「與民同樂」的俗話，如此看來，則是，與上同樂了。</p>
<p>白玉霜是吾適合電影條件？這在「上等階級的」如洪深等捧爲「東方梅蕙絲」的肉麻話看來，似乎稍稍可以釋然。（雖然我們還是不能無惑！）不過，電影如果僅僅是舞臺的複製，那麼我們就根本不必要有電影。何况，把白玉霜的「捧」上銀幕，動機就祇爲了把蹦蹦戲的「淫蕩」部份搬上銀幕！</p>
<p>爲了這種惡劣的傾向，我們是非予以一個嚴厲的打擊不可的！</p>
<p>白玉霜的戲「海棠紅」，統一藝術化以二萬元包給明星公司代爲攝製，這個戲的故事，是由「淺薄」先生王乾白盡一日之力想出來的，內容可知。</p>
<p>爲了「海棠紅」，據說天一公司還大喫其醋，因爲天一也頗有取而代之的雄心也。又一說：「海棠紅」將借天一攝影塲拍攝云。</p>
<p>就退一萬步來說，電檢會是吾能將「海棠紅」的「精華」（也即是蹦蹦戲的「精華」）淫蕩部份通過？也是一個問題。</p>
<p>除非電檢會借公期給「東方梅蕙絲」的魔力所迷惑。</p>

<h3>建築材料騐收脞談（上）</h3>
<p>— 朱丕顯</p>
<p>凡是建築工程的寔施，村料是必需要的一種原素，面材料交到工地的當兒，主管工事長，與負責監工員，就負有騐收材料的責任。材料是怎樣騐收的？怎樣騐收材料，纔能完美萬全，這就是本篇中所要說起的幾點。</p>
<p>騐收以前的準備</p>
<p>爲要獲得材料騐收的圓滿，事先，在騐取之前，負責騐收的人，應該有所準備。準備，其寔也是極簡單的事：第一須將是項建築工程之工程條例與施工細則，詳加檢閱，牢記心頭。第二須把與承包人所訂合同，仔細翻閱，也加牢記。第三承包人所呈送的貨樣，須逐一檢騐，把其檢騐結果，登載手册。如是有上述三項的根據，充作材料騐收的準備，那末成竹在胸，騐收起來也就大致不差了。</p>
<p>騐收時候的手續</p>
<p>當承包人材料送到工地，騐收也就開始。騐收的手續：第一步當然是檢騐材料的品質，這一點，可由承包人澦繳貨樣爲藍本，如果所騐兩相符合，那就起卸進棧，假如是兩不相符，那就不能收用。第二步爲指導材料的堆置，這須要審度工塲地形，與工作便利的二事爲主，商承主管建築師的同意，而規定地點，去堆置材料，方能無所罣碍，吾則或將影響工作的効率，或會遭受建築師的斥駡，故材料堆置，須妥爲指導。第三步爲計算材料的數量，爲了材料估價的單位之不同，材料數量的計算，因之各異，可分作過磅，量方，與點數的三種方法：材料之以體重計單位的，必須過磅；材料之以體積爲單位的，必須量方；材料之以件數爲單位的，必須點數。</p>
<p>水料的騐收</p>
<p>建築所用的各種材料，當以水料爲最廣，蓋水料包有磚瓦，泥砂，洋灰，石子，大理石，花崗石等，應用於建築最多故也。至各項水料的如何騐收茲分別述後：</p>
<p>洋灰的騐收——洋灰是有廠商牌號的，騐收時關於質的方面，如預先指定者，只須檢視其牌子是吾原封，不過爲避免奸商的蒙蔽，有時可一檢其洋灰的色澤與粒，查檢有無冒充攙雜，以防减料。洋灰的堆置，須避雨水，故以安放在上有蓋，下有墊，四面有遮欄的棚廠內爲宜。洋灰是裝在本桶，鐵桶，或麻袋中的，所以洋灰是點桶或袋的數量來計算的。</p>
<p>砂泥石子的騐收——黃砂黃泥石子，這都是合三和土所不可缺一的材料，其質的檢騐，如由機械加以分析試騐其正確的成份，能力外，平常騐收的時侯，應加注意的：黃泥須着水相黏，而不混有雜砂；黃砂須粒粗角銳，着水不黏，而不含有雜泥，石子須顏色潔凈，現純粹的靑灰，有邊緣稜角，而不含有雜質泥砂，及山皮草根等物。砂泥與石子，都是散裝的，所以計算用體積量方，堆置成四方梯形立體，騐收者，量其高低，度其長短闊狹，三者相成得方，方的單位英租界每方一百立方英尺，上海市每方一立方公尺，每一英方等於二·八三公方。至堆置時，宜注意者，須上有棚，以避雨雪，而下有墊，則取用至最後，方不致連地皮一同剷去。</p>
<h3>世界第一大橋（上）</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>在舊金山與奧克蘭的中間，目　正有許多工程師和工人在建造着一座橫跨舊金山灣的鐵橋。這座鐵橋不但規模宏大，可稱世界第一，卽其建造之新奇，亦開橋梁建築之先例。原來此橋分東西二段，東段自奧克蘭達海灣中之由巴布那島，西段自由巴布那島達舊金山；在西段橋下，有一座水泥造成的中央橋脚，高大可與四十層之摩天樓相比；爲使這橋脚穩固起見，工程師不得不設計一種完全新奇的方法使那作爲橋脚的基礎的巨大的浮閘箱沉入海底。</p>
<p>此中央橋脚，高出水面三百呎深入水面下亦百八十呎。在這巨大的橋脚上，擱置兩座吊橋相接的末端。舊金山與由巴亦那　中間相距二哩，僅造一座帛橋是萬不可能的，所以必須造一個中央脚橋使兩座吊橋得以連接。</p>
<p>作爲橋脚起點之新式浮閘箱，形如深底的駁船，四週用板倏沿襯，近底數呎則用鋼板，使邊緣鋒利，易於割裂底下泥土。</p>
<p>浮着時，這浮閘箱看去像一簇巨大的蜂房。這里所謂蜂房，就是鎔接在浮閘箱內五十五枝直管子頂端的鋼圖頂。這五十五枝直管子，相互用鋼條支撑，徑口大得可容一架普通的昇降機，內部裝滿壓縮空氣，使浮閘箱具浮泛性。這浮閘箱被安放在適當的位置，用每隻重達十二噸至十五噸的水泥　維繫：四週打椿，又造一圈木柵幽住，使不受船隻及水底岩滓時衝撞。</p>
<p>在管子的週圍，水泥箱倒下去，直到加增的重量使浮閘箱下沈。工人們用火脫開管子頂端的圓頂——每决只移去以數幾隻，使浮閘箱的浮力不受打擾。二十呎長的新管子，接在每隻移去圓頂的管子上面，新管子頂端仍用圓頂蓋住。同時，浮閘箱四週的木柵亦逐漸加高。水泥又倒下去，和添增的管子的浮力相抵消。這樣，浮閘箱逐漸下沈，直至深入水面下八十呎。</p>
<p>到了浮閘箱深埋土中的時侯，管子中的氣壓給緩緩地弛放——須注意整個浮閘箱繼續完全垂直。所有管子頂端的圓頂都給移去。於是這些管子就變成挖泥吊桶的「豎坑」了。</p>
<p>用吊車把這些蛤殼式的拕泥吊桶投入管子中，每一回抓起四立方呎泥土，吊桶給吊起的時候，就把泥土拋入隣近的海水中。要是碰到硬塊，就用高壓力的水管在管子中冲水，使硬塊軟化，易被吊桶扒起。隨着泥土的拕掘，浮閘箱逐漸下沈，有到牠停頓在水面下一百八十呎的岩上。於是管子的底端給用水泥封固，垂部管子給用水充塞。浮出水面的浮閘箱上面，就可以裝上水泥的橋脚了。</p>
<h3>建築家之家</h3>
<p>— 張廣正譯</p>
<p>美國建築家羅巴特·波洛氏，曾自己設計，自己施工，造成了純粹的自作住宅。</p>
<p>其構造，是羅氏硏究出來的一種乾式構造，其主要着眼點是建造快速，價格便宜，外觀美麗，構築堅牢等。</p>
<p>其房屋部位的安排，就圖面說來是這樣：寬四十五尺，深二十尺的矩形。屋分二層，形式簡單；還有一間小小的地下室。</p>
<p>下層設車間，便所，廚房及較闊的客廳。於客廳中配置食桌，兼作膳堂用。壁際上部裝收音機，中部裝電話及可以摺疊伸縮的小桌，下部安放書架及陳列架。這樣，娛樂，通話，讀書等無不俱備。煖爐是圍坐暢談時使用的，至於煖房設儼，則是在地下室裝一汽鍋，採用低壓式的水管煖房裝置。煖爐旣爲娛樂用的，故式樣極矯巧玲瓏，且熱度亦不甚大。於簡易中，更具防火意義。蓋從耐震與安全方面着想，若爲木造建築，則壁爐殊不適宜。同時，如煖爐的燃料用木炭，則亦爲一樸實優雅的室內裝飾。</p>
<p>樓上是由四寢室與二浴室（兼作便所）構成。家主所居的寢室，較別的爲大，內設化裝鏡，並置一有二十餘個抽屜的衣櫥，附設更衣室，且自其地位至浴室極便利。更衣室背後更有大壁櫃。</p>
<p>全屋的構造法，採用飛艇的構造式樣。屋內的柱，梁，隔壁等，悉用尺五寸左右的圓木柱與厚板組成。誠然，此乃美國絕無僅有的奇事。但，羅氏的獨特的設計是：於內部壁柱，糊上鋁質的箔，並且於適宜處裝上條紋美觀的美國杉板，其所用的釘，皆爲黃色精銅製，旣叮防板壁的脫落，而同時亦可　裝飾的効果，眞可說一舉兩得。還有，墻壁糊　鋁質的箔；可充分隔斷外界的溫度，濕　，音響等，因是乃造成非常簡易而父價廉的良好壁體，實一至可　滿意的事。</p>
<p>不用何種特殊的技巧，祇要將木材的外皮去除，從中剖割成板，則其外觀已頗美麗了。</p>
<p>全部的建築費約八百元美金，地價的一百三四十元美金。以如是的價値，竟能建造包有煖房及其他設備的建築物。於世界物價極高的美國，此種價格，不能不說確是極端低廉的。</p>
<p>未造建築的外部裝飾，誠為建築家所最煞費苦心的事。外部板壁的造　，旣須美觀，而亦須顧慮經濟，安全等。苟稍有不妥嗎，卽極易露出寒酸相。故無論如何，必須最注意外部板壁的裝飾。羅氏的設計，從其構造上，安排上，可以說頗能得到滿足的評價。</p>
<p>還有，外部板壁的裝設，若欲得端莊的感覺，則材料的厚度亦爲。一應注意之點。大槪，外部板壁的最低厚度，亦須有一寸以土。不過各地氣候的差異，也爲决定外部板壁厚度的標準。</p>
<h3>建築行話（二十二）</h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>——關於築塲裏用——</p>
<p>料房——築塲裏的木匠有做操塲和做裝修的區別。操塲就是一些粗糙的工作。例如撑壳子。豎大料。鋪樓板。搭五架。做屋面等。裝修就是敲樘子。配門窗。刨錢脚等。但木匠於做裝修的部份。並不像做操塲和泥水匠（泥水匠也有分別。如黏花頭。扯綫脚。蓋灰頭統稱做粉刷。其他砌墻。蓋瓦。等則叫砌墻。）一樣地一天功夫都消磨在露天的。因爲做裝修的工匠（卽老司務）對於工作是缺少不得一張作凳（詳前）的。所以魷須耍料房。料房的意思便是一種屋內工作的塲所。</p>
<p>腰塲——築塲裏做工的。不論木匠。泥水匠。三和土匠。漆匠。溝渠匠。鋸匠。搗水門汀匠。等在工程的設施上必有一定的步驟。劉於工匠的去留問題。做當手（詳前）的隨時有統制的權力。說去就去。說來就來。去時祇要工錢算淸楚。對方就不會有什麼表示了。而且也决不會發生什麼勞資糾葛的事件。這就呌腰塲。例如某一個築塲裏三和十匠已經將房屋墻溝部份的三和土做好。同時房屋圍墻部份。因爲工作有犯界（詳前）的原因。不能一决做完。那末對於（這未完的工作。勢必暫停。而三和土匠在這時亦得暫時腰塲。腰塲就是普通商店所謂辭退的意思。</p>
<p>嬲手——築塲裏旣然有上列所謂腰塲的事情。做當手的在工程暫停的時期中。必須另找築塲預備手下的那些工匠有開塲的機　。然而說不定凑巧的事就會發生。譬如甲的地方工程難能動工。而乙的地方偏偏也是不可以開塲。在這樣的情勢下。做當手的不得不在家裏坐吃。築塲裏對於這種名稱呌做嬲手。</p>
<p>開塲——在業主和作頭對於承攬的房屋雙方合同簽字之後。作頭就得在工程地段賣施工作。叫做開塲。</p>
<p>齋老司務——築塲裏有一種神怪的舉動。就是齋老司務。齊時須在上正樑的當兒。木匠泥水匠個個要必躬必恭的磕頭作揖。據說可以避免一切危險的。相傳老司務卽列國時的魯班。因爲　班是水木業的鼻祖。同時鐵匠帮也有老司務。可不是魯班而是對神榜裏那位一氣化三淸的老子。至於爲什麼要上正樑時點香燃燭的齋老司務的意思。可惜筆者不得而知了。</p>
<p>竹靑——就是竹頭的靑面。可是這裏的所謂竹靑。並非　如是解。造裏的竹靑。就是木匠用以彈綫的那只墨斗裏使之調和墨汁的一支像掃帚形的筆。</p>

<h3>Chiang's Talk to Heads of Various Ministries and Commissions</h3>
<p>Nanjing: President Chiang took office on the morning of the 16th. The original text of his talk to the heads of various ministries and commissions is as follows: "Because the previous President's health has not yet recovered, I and the various ministers reluctantly assume our new posts today. Respectfully adhering to the resolution of the Fifth National Congress of our Party, which resolved to convene the National Assembly on November 12th of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), we, the comrades of our Party, after this resolution of the Congress, bear the responsibility of completing the political tutelage and the active implementation of all the measures indicated in the Premier's Outline of National Reconstruction. We should be of one heart and one mind, exerting all our efforts. Now, I would like to briefly state my thoughts. To achieve national security, officials must first be diligent and devoted to their duties. Those of us who serve in the government must know that every thought and every action is related to the safety, well-being, and happiness of the people. We must be diligent and hardworking, striving in our work. From now on, the performance of every public official will be strictly assessed. Those who are efficient and excellent will be specially protected, ensuring stability and rewarding them. Those who are ineffective will not be tolerated and will be severely punished. It is especially hoped that all those in office will act with conscience and strive for progress. The overlaps and conflicts between various ministries, as well as the acts of self-seeking that hinder the overall administrative efficiency, should be forcefully adjusted. In short, we must clarify the bureaucracy, comprehensively assess performance against reputation, so as to achieve political enlightenment and accomplish the sole task of saving the country. In recent years, natural disasters have been frequent, society has been declining, and the people's lives have become increasingly difficult. The government, with regard to economic construction, should first develop resources and revitalize production, so that the resources on the ground and the deposits underground can each fully benefit and be utilized. We must develop industry and commerce, reduce unnecessary waste, and strive for the most practical results, so that everyone can exert their strength and the people can enjoy their lives. What we usually aim for is to revitalize the national spirit with the New Life Movement and to cultivate the material foundation with the National Economic Construction Movement. From now on, we must rely on this principle of saving the country and saving ourselves to fully achieve our goals. The Chinese national situation is extremely precarious, as everyone knows. The key to survival and continuity lies today. Comrades are aware that this responsibility is extremely heavy. We should follow the resolution of the Fifth National Congress. All matters that do not hinder China's national freedom and equality should be discussed and resolved together. If there are matters that hinder the country's freedom and equality, the government will not make any concessions. We are willing to exert the greatest effort to consolidate international peace, and we are not afraid to make the final sacrifice to maintain the country's life. I hope that my colleagues will deeply understand this intention, work together, and exhaust their duties." (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Suma and Amemiya Met Chiang Kai-shek Without Meeting</h3>

Fortunately, the foreign policy has been repeatedly clarified by President Chiang, and he will strive to proceed under the leadership of President Chiang. As for the administrative aspects of this ministry, the previous president has planned and managed the ministry for several years, and the scale is well established. He will follow the established rules and seek improvements. He believes that to seek progress in governance, one must first seek the soundness of the administrative institutions and the soundness of those engaged in politics. Only with sound political personnel and sound administrative institutions can functions be fully utilized and发挥功. The New Life Movement promoted by President Chiang is a movement to improve our spiritual life. He hopes that the colleagues of this ministry will pay special attention to the guidelines of the New Life Movement, must invigorate their spirits, and work hard, sweeping away all the habits of romance, sloppiness, perfunctoriness, and complacency, so as to increase administrative efficiency. Because the time is short today, he cannot talk in detail, but he has briefly expressed his humble views as above. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>The Issue of the Common Maximum Limit and the Balance of Power in the Far East</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The London Naval Conference has been open for over a week, and the state of opposition between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan has become increasingly apparent. Of particular note is the proposal put forward by Japanese representative Admiral Nagano, which states that "all naval powers should maintain a common maximum limit, reduce offensive forces, and strengthen defensive forces." This proposal has become the central issue for the United Kingdom and the United States in their united opposition to Japan.</p>
<p>The so-called common maximum limit for naval power, in other words, is to determine a common maximum limit under the principle of equal naval armaments among nations. The essence of this proposal is purely based on Japan's own interests, with the goal of monopolizing the Western Pacific and the East Asian mainland. Therefore, as soon as this proposal was released, the atmosphere of the conference became tense. The shared attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States to closely watch the situation in the Far East corresponds with their shared opposition to the proposals made by Japan. In response, U.S. representative Davis stated that "Japan's so-called equality is sufficient to create actual inequality," while the representative of the South African Federation, supported by the United Kingdom, openly declared their opposition to this proposal by Japan in their capacity as an autonomous nation. The recent tension in the relationship between the United Kingdom and Japan is truly unprecedented, and the connection between the United Kingdom and the United States will become closer due to Japan's strong stance on the principle of a common maximum for naval power and its strengthening of its monopolization of East Asia. This is something that we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>We believe that the base points of the London Naval Conference are two-fold: one is to maintain the balance of power in the Far East, and the other is to create a balance of power in the Mediterranean. Maintaining the balance of power in the Far East should be the focus of the conference. Observing the development of the naval conference situation over the past week, the speeches of representatives from various countries, and the private consultations that have taken place, all revolve around these two issues. When the private meeting between British and Japanese representatives took place on the 14th of this month, the British representative expressed two points to the Japanese delegation in a frank manner: 1. Naval equality will put the United Kingdom at a disadvantage in the Far East because, regardless of the situation in the Far East, a large part of the British fleet must be stationed in European waters. 2. The imperial responsibilities borne by the United Kingdom are extremely heavy, and it is truly necessary to maintain a larger navy to protect equality and safety. Although the true intentions of U.S. representative Davis at the naval conference have not been clearly stated, his statements have emphasized maintaining the principle of ratios and maintaining "balance of power." We can see that his intention is to maintain the existing strengths in the Far East. France and Italy have a fairly consistent attitude at the naval conference, and the preservation of submarines and the return of Gibraltar to Spain or its neutralization are both common demands of the two countries. Their intention is only to maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>In summary, we can see that the general principles discussed at the naval conference, although on the surface are purely technical issues of qualitative restrictions and quantitative reductions, in reality include the re-division of the world market and the re-demarcation of political spheres of influence. The "common maximum limit" proposal put forward by Japan is closely related to the survival of our nation and is something that we cannot ignore in the current situation.</p>

<h3>Students in Beiping Stage Demonstration and Parade Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Police Use Force to Disperse Them - Dozens Injured and Arrested - Gather Outside the City for a General Assembly - Telegram Opposing Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Beiping: More than a thousand students from Tsinghua and Yenching Universities marched into the city at 6:00 AM on the 16th. Since Xizhimen had already been closed, they detoured to Xibianmen and forced their way in. Along the way, they joined up with students from various schools, passing along Xiheyan to Hepingmen. At the same time, students from the Beida Law School and vocational schools exited Hepingmen, intending to unite with the students of the Normal University. Outside Hepingmen, they clashed with the police, with both sides throwing stones at each other. The situation was extremely serious. The police, outnumbered, fled. At that time, the High School attached to the Normal University had its gates locked, preventing the students from leaving. After the other students arrived, they demolished the school gate of the attached high school and marched together toward South Xinhua Street, clashing with the police along the way. By this time, the student contingent had grown to over two thousand people. Reaching Hufangqiao, they turned east and proceeded to Zhushikou. At this time, students from Northeastern University marched along Qianmen Avenue from Tianqiao to Zhushikou, where the two groups met, their momentum growing even greater, numbering about four thousand people. The police at that location had heard of their approach and fled. The students then marched together towards Qianmen. The police at Qianmen were prepared and fired into the air, at the same time using force to disperse the students. Chaos erupted and the students sought refuge in shops. As a result, many shops had their doors and windows broken. After the gunfire ceased, the students regrouped in front of the West Railway Station and demanded to enter the city. After repeated negotiations yielded no results, the students held a temporary assembly at that location. They immediately decided to: 1. Send telegrams to the whole country and the whole world to unanimously oppose the puppet organization. 2. Demand that the municipal government release the arrested students, compensate the injured students for their medical expenses, and formally apologize to the students. 3. Request that the government not suppress patriotic movements. After the meeting, they requested to enter the city and declared to the authorities that they would not act outside the bounds of the law after entering the city. After the authorities sent representatives to reply, they agreed to allow the students to enter the city through Xuanwumen. The students then marched in formation towards Xuanwumen, but when they arrived at the gate, the city gate had already been closed and was heavily guarded by many police officers. The students negotiated repeatedly, but to no avail. As of 6:00 PM, they were still outside the gate and had not dispersed. At the same time, there was also a contingent of students, numbering about four to five hundred, inside Xuanwumen, who intended to go out of the city to join the students outside the gate, but to no avail. They were dispersed by the police with force. Many students were injured and arrested. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping: Students from various schools in Beiping held a large-scale petition this morning. The police and gendarmes received reports in advance and were ordered to deploy in full force to guard closely. Students from the Normal University in the city gathered at the school, but were surrounded by police and gendarmes on all sides and could not leave. About three hundred students from Peking University set off from Shatan in succession at 9:00 AM, marching in formation along Houmen Factory Bridge, distributing various leaflets, and shouting slogans such as "Oppose Autonomy" and "Down with Traitors." Most of the students from Northeastern University were prevented from leaving the school, except for a few who left the school separately and gathered along the way. More than a thousand students from Yenching and Tsinghua Universities organized vanguard suicide squads and set off at 5:00 AM. At 6:40 AM, they arrived at Xizhimen, and the police and gendarmes stationed in the city immediately closed the city gate to prevent them from entering the city. After half an hour, the students went to Fuchengmen, but were also blocked by the police and gendarmes. They gradually dispersed around noon. The northwestern cities and Hepingmen in the city were closed, and more than 20 students were arrested in Xidan Archway and South Xinhua Street and sent to the Public Security Bureau. Other students from several schools gathered separately in Tiananmen, Wumen, and Houmen, hoping to assemble a team and parade to petition. However, they were mostly dispersed by the police on the way and were not allowed to linger, so they did not achieve their goals. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping: The six to seven hundred students gathered outside Xuanwumen demanded to enter the city to no avail, so they sat on the ground and shouted slogans. Having been without food or drink from morning to night, they looked quite dejected. At 8:30 PM, they regrouped and turned onto Luomashi Street via Xuanwai Avenue, gradually dispersing along the way. A portion of them returned to Normal University. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping: The students petitioning outside Xuanwumen were from eight schools, including Tsinghua, Yenching, Northeastern University, and Normal University, numbering about 1,500. At around 8:00 PM, after being persuaded by the police guarding the city gate, they changed course and headed south, returning to their respective schools. When they arrived near Chunming Girls' High School, a police officer suddenly ordered the use of fire hoses to spray water and prevent them from advancing. The students scattered in confusion, and order was disrupted, disrupting traffic for an hour. At around 9:00 PM, the school presidents heard the news and feared that accidents would occur, so they urgently telegraphed Mayor Qin, asking him to stop the police from using force. The situation began to ease slightly, and the students gradually dispersed after 10:00 PM. According to investigations, the injured reached</p>
<p>Beiping: Qin Decun and Xiao Zhenying invited university presidents to talk at the Jurentang tonight around 9:00 PM. (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping: More than fifty presidents and professors from universities such as National Peking University, Normal University, Tsinghua University, Ping University, and private Yenching University and Fu Jen University held a meeting at the Sino-American Alumni Association this afternoon to discuss matters such as persuading students to attend classes peacefully. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Education telegraphed the presidents of five universities in Beiping City—Peking, Tsinghua, Peiping, Normal, and Yenching—and the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau on the 16th, saying roughly that the national crisis is severe, and the youth are inevitably depressed. Recently, students from various schools in Peiping City have repeatedly expressed their views on current affairs. The government and society have deeply discerned their sincerity in loving the country, but the purpose and actions must not contradict each other. This is what patriotic youths should also understand. In the future, all actions such as strikes, parades, or activities away from school must be stopped by the teachers and school administrators. If their actions do not go beyond the correct path, the presidents can convey the students' legitimate opinions to the government. The Ministry will do its best to maintain the safety of the academic community, and hopes that this intention will be earnestly conveyed. This is of utmost importance. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping: After several days of calm in Peiping, students demonstrated again today. Five thousand students paraded through the streets, opposing the separation of Hebei and Chahar from the central government, and appealing to the soldiers of Song Zheyuan's 29th Army to resist the enemy with the spirit of the dadao (broadsword) at Xifengkou and oppose North China's autonomy. Many groups of students gathered at Tianqiao, while another group of 1,500 was blocked by police on West Chang'an Street. The police used broadswords and bamboo poles to attack the students, injuring ten to fifteen people. The police later brought a fire truck, intending to disperse the demonstrators with cold water, but the windscreen of the fire truck was smashed by the students. The students at Tianqiao formed rows of six people, their formation neat, and returned to their schools. Many of them were female students, distributing leaflets along the way. Five hundred students from Yenching and Tsinghua Universities, when they reached Qianmen, saw that the police were blocking their way home. The police hastily closed the city gate, while the student ranks were extremely orderly, like an army. When they approached the police station, the police ran away and fired into the air. The students were caught off guard, and the formation dispersed, but soon regrouped, standing in the open space between Qianmen and Pinghan Station. Some of the police carried pistols or rifles, while others held broadswords, but their appearance was extremely flustered. Those carrying firearms had their hands on their guns. The students then sent representatives to negotiate with them, who were allowed to pass. The mentally disturbed police then fired into the air again. A Reuters reporter was present at the scene and said that the police were so panicked at the time that they were lucky not to have injured their own companions, let alone the students. Some of the police used blanks, but others used live ammunition. The Normal University was surrounded by police this morning, preventing students from leaving the school, but after a clash with the police, about a hundred students broke out of the school and joined the parade. At noon, the streets were full of police. There were many police stationed at the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the location of this morning's meeting of the Political Affairs Committee. Although the students outside Qianmen were threatened by police gunfire, they were fortunately not injured. The police guarding the city gate were just patrolmen, without a single officer. Although the police fired three volleys of gunfire in succession, the second and third volleys did not cause the students to panic. They stood firm without retreating. There were later as many as a hundred police guarding the city gate. After a long discussion between the two sides, an officer arrived on the scene and realized that the students had no intention of violence, so he opened the city gate and let them through. The students had been waiting for three hours. Many of those marching in the front row were female students. Even though the police fired at them from only forty yards away, they remained calm and composed. One of the Yenching University students, an American, spoke to a journalist, saying that he did not consider himself an outsider, but spoke of "we students" and "our demands." Many Yenching and Tsinghua students had already entered the city last night in order to participate in the parade. The remaining students from these two schools set off in formation this morning, but were blocked by the police and dispersed in the western city, entering the city on their own. By 4:00 PM, most of the demonstrators had returned to their schools. The city was very quiet at night. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Tianjin: The Changlu Salt Transport Envoy Office received an official letter from the puppet Eastern Hebei organization, stating that all salt taxes within the puppet organization's area are not allowed to be remitted to the central government. The office has not replied. The Changlu Salt Transport Envoy Office has jurisdiction over the Lutai and Fengcai salt fields. The Lutai salt field is located on the coast south of Lutai Town, and the Fengcai salt field is located in the Tanggu area. Both are still producing salt as before. Although the puppet organization has an official letter and intercepted money, according to the investigation, the salt tax bureaus in the two salt fields are collected in Tianjin, and there is no tax collection agency in the salt fields. The puppet organization immediately intercepted the money. What is withheld is only salt. Also, there are no salt tax agencies in the 22 counties of the war zone. The Ministry of Finance has instructed Tianjin that if the puppet Eastern Hebei organization intercepts Changlu salt exports, the Changlu Transport Office should adopt blockade measures. Although there are many salt tax donations in the war zone, Lu salt is used for sales outside the war zone so that there is no loss of tax. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Changlu salt tax totaled 20 million last year, and the amount collected up to now this year has exceeded this number. All revenue is deposited in the Central Bank of Tianjin, except for payment of the Second Year of the Republic of China Post-War Reorganization Public Bonds and various foreign secured loans. The remainder is used for North China military expenses and war zone public debt guarantee and interest repayment, 1.5 million annually. If the puppet organization intercepts the money, the number lost is only the number of public debt guarantees within the war zone. The authorities believe that there is no excessive need to consider this. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

Chairman Feng Yuxiang led the ceremony and then gave a report, mainly encouraging all comrades and people across the country to strengthen their spirits, work together with one heart and one mind, and jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country from danger. The meeting adjourned at 9:40. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The gist of Feng Yuxiang's report at the Central Memorial Week is as follows: Now that the national crisis is serious, we should follow the teachings of the Premier, restore nationalism, and make plans to save the country and survive. But the fundamental problem is to strengthen the spirit and start with practicing the New Life Movement. We should hope that the people of the whole country can practice the New Life Movement, and all comrades in the central government should take the lead in practicing it, so that the upper and lower levels can follow suit. This is the most fundamental solution to saving the country. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government held a memorial week at 10:30 AM on the 16th, attended by Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Bo Wenwei, Feng Yuxiang, Zhu Peide, Qin Zhen, Cheng Qian, Li Wenfan, Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Chaojun, Wang Yongbin, Chen Daqi, Cao Haosen, Chen Xunyong, Chu Minyi, Mao Zuquan, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Yipeng, Jiao Yitang, Wang Gupan, Chen Qicai, Lv Chao, Wei Huai, etc., as well as the heads of various ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan who took office by oath, and Wang Shuchang, Vice President of the Military Council, Mai Huanzhang, member of the Control Yuan who participated in the supplementary oath, and more than 800 staff members of the various ministries and commissions of the National Government. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave a report on "National Prosperity Through Adversity." The ceremony concluded at 11:00. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chairman Lin reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 16th. The original words were mainly to explain the meaning of the Premier's fifth lecture on nationalism, "National Prosperity Through Adversity, is to know that the country is in adversity, so strive to be heroic, it is completely a psychological effect," in great detail, saying that we are in a time of trouble and hardship, and for "National Prosperity Through Adversity," we can only do our best, because the survival of the country is the same as that of an organic life. The fruit we get today is the cause we created yesterday. The prosperity and decline of living things depend on cultivation, and the strength and weakness of a country depend on management. To create effective good causes, we must make efforts in the present. Although the arrival of disasters seems to have complex causes and multiple effects, it is not easy to find. However, the ancients said that man can conquer nature, and as long as there is a way, it can be recovered, and we can definitely overcome the difficulties. He also cited examples of national prosperity through adversity in Chinese and foreign history to encourage the people. Finally, he said that at this critical period for the country, we can only avoid panic and not be discouraged, learn from the Premier's spirit of sincerity, perseverance, and resilience, unite together and strive forward, seeking a way out for national revival from difficulties and hardships. Only then will we not betray the mission of the party or the teachings of the Premier. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: After Chief Justice Ju Zheng and President Qin Zhen of the Judicial Yuan took the oath of office at the Central Party Headquarters auditorium on the morning of the 16th, they rushed back to the Judicial Yuan at 11:30 to preside over the Premier's Memorial Week. Ju Zheng, Qin Zhen, Xie Guansheng, Mao Zuquan, and more than 100 staff members of the Central Disciplinary Committee of the Judicial Yuan attended. Chairman Ju Zheng also delivered a speech, saying that he has been in charge of the judiciary for four years and has nothing to show for it, which is a shame. He had previously resigned to the Central Committee, but the various parties believed that the national crisis was underway and he could not be secure, so he had to shoulder the heavy responsibility again and wait for the National Assembly next year to withdraw and give way to capable people. Now that the National Assembly is very close, he hopes that his colleagues will work harder to show results, so that they will not fail the expectations of the Central Committee and the people of the country. After the speech, a group photo was taken and the meeting was adjourned. There have been no changes in the staff of the hospital. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Opposition to Peace Plan Rises Like Bees; Internal Rifts Appear in the British Cabinet; Activity on Downing Street Seeks to Quell the Uproar; Prime Minister Baldwin is Caught in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>London, According to a recent report in the Daily Mail, a significant rift has emerged within the government since the publication of the White Paper on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Several cabinet ministers are deeply dissatisfied with the dispatch sent by Foreign Secretary Hoare to the Emperor of Abyssinia and the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Among them, Minister without Portfolio Eden, and other younger cabinet members such as Agriculture Minister Elliot, Education Minister Stanley, War Secretary Duff Cooper, and Public Works Minister Ormsby-Gore, are rumored to be considering resignation. "The cabinet will hold a meeting today, and these ministers will undoubtedly raise several questions demanding explanations. Prime Minister Baldwin is already in a difficult position, as the opposition and a segment of Conservative Party members have expressed dissatisfaction with the plan for the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. He will certainly do everything possible to prevent a cabinet upheaval," the report says. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London, The Foreign Office was exceptionally busy today. Observers believe that significant developments are likely to occur regarding the Italian-Abyssinian issue. In the evening, Prime Minister Baldwin hurried to 10 Downing Street for a meeting with Minister without Portfolio Eden. Subsequently, Eden met with Home Secretary Simon. Diplomatic circles believe that the Prime Minister will ask the House of Commons to hold a vote of confidence on the government on Thursday during the debate on the Italian-Abyssinian case and the general international crisis. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>London, There was considerable activity among cabinet ministers on Downing Street late last week. A temporary cabinet meeting will be held today to prepare for the debate in the House of Commons on Thursday regarding the Anglo-French peace plan. This morning, The Times commented on the reaction of Britain and overseas dominions to this plan, stating that the cabinet, in light of the clear expression of public opinion, should resolve that British representatives cannot compel the League of Nations' Administrative Council to accept the Paris plan. Now that Abyssinia has given a solemn reply, and there is obvious hesitation in Geneva, the obligation to accept this plan no longer exists. Cabinet members should also dispel the rumors that Foreign Secretary Hoare fears the war will spread to Europe, and therefore must tacitly approve Laval's harmful proposal. It should be known that a war extending to the whole of Europe and Britain will never materialize. Britain has never had the issue of assisting Abyssinia in the war, and Britain has never abandoned the principle that any action required for collective security must be collective action, nor will it change its stance in the future.

<h3>British Cabinet Holds Meeting to Discuss Domestic and International Situations</h3>
<p>London, Cabinet ministers concerned with the Italian-Abyssinian dispute held a meeting this morning. It is generally believed that this meeting was to discuss the situation that has arisen in various national capitals since the release of the Anglo-French peace plan. Foreign Secretary Hoare will return to London from Switzerland tomorrow. It is expected that after the Foreign Secretary's return, the cabinet will hold another meeting to decide on a course of action, which will be conveyed to Geneva by Minister without Portfolio Eden to attend the meeting of the League of Nations' Administrative Council. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London, The House of Commons is scheduled to debate the government's foreign policy on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Hoare will rush back from Switzerland to attend and deliver a speech in his defense. According to what the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily News knows, Hoare will offer an explanation at that time, stating that since the principles on which the League of Nations is based are powerless to implement, it should be content with a less than satisfactory result. Because the member states of the League of Nations are mostly unprepared to shoulder responsibility, the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute proposed by Britain and France is the best option. After all, a portion of Abyssinian territory has already been occupied by Italian troops, and since other countries are not prepared to expel them, and are unwilling to supply Abyssinia with weapons due to its lack of purchasing power, the only way to stop the war is to consider an oil embargo. However, this is considered a hostile act by Italy. If the League of Nations is determined to implement it, it must ask its member states whether they are prepared to take necessary measures in the army, navy, and air force to support it. "The British government has already inquired about the attitudes of various countries, and the results prove that European countries are not prepared to assist the League of Nations, placing such a large responsibility on Britain alone." "Therefore, the government should declare clearly to the House of Commons that 'The Anglo-French plan is not more than 50% satisfactory in the eyes of the League of Nations, and this is due to the fact that the League of Nations itself is unable to exert its potential power to more than 50%, or is not prepared to exert its potential power to this extent, and the results are equivalent," the report says.

<h3>Laval to Explain Foreign Policy to Parliament; Herriot's Attitude Softens</h3>
<p>Paris, When the Chamber of Deputies convenes tomorrow, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will present a report on the government's current foreign policy. This move is of great concern to the general public. Minister without Portfolio Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, originally held a firm opposition to the compromise plan for the Italian-Abyssinian dispute proposed by Britain and France. It is now heard that his stance has softened, in order to avoid triggering a cabinet crisis. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Montbéliard, France, Minister without Portfolio Herriot, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, recently delivered a speech at a banquet of the Radical Party branch here, stating, "We tried to prevent the Italian-Abyssinian War beforehand. Now that the war has begun, we advocate finding a reconciliation plan so that the war can end as soon as possible, so that the two parties, both members of the League of Nations, can move closer together. This position remains unchanged. However, the reconciliation plan should only be freely accepted by the two parties concerned. If, as the Portuguese representative to the League of Nations said, a weaker and smaller country is forced to accept reconciliation through 'procedural usurpation,' it is unacceptable to us. Not only that, the reconciliation plan must also be accepted by the League of Nations, so it should not conflict with the principles of the League of Nations' covenant, collective security, and the system of universal peace. This year, Geneva has made the first resolution to realize the spirit of cooperation. This spirit is admirable, and the reconciliation plan should cherish it and not destroy it. Now that this great hope has arisen, no French person who carefully considers the advantages and disadvantages and takes into account the future of the country can allow this hope to be destroyed," he said. (According to a recent report in Le Parisien, Herriot's opposition to the Anglo-French solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute may consider the issue of his departure and freedom of action.)

<h3>British and French Celebrities Gather in Paris to Promote Cooperation Between the Two Countries; Implement Collective Security Within the Scope of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Paris, British and French celebrities gathered here to discuss Anglo-French cooperation and the establishment of a collective security system. Lord Cecil, former British representative to the League of Nations, delivered a speech, saying, "The way to establish peace in Europe is nothing more than maintaining cooperation between Britain and France, and strictly adhering to the regulations of the League of Nations. After cooperation between Britain and France, the majority of nations will certainly come forward to help with all their strength. However, if the efforts of the two countries are to be successful, they must avoid the idea of surpassing each other. All tendencies before 1914, such as the arms race and the establishment of alliances dividing Europe, must be abandoned, and collective action must be implemented within the scope of the League of Nations," he said. Subsequently, Belgian Senator Rolin, British MP Lansbury, French MP Longuet, and Ganshui Creek delivered speeches one after another. Among them, Mr. Gan said, "If we allow certain countries to do what they want by force, then France itself will inevitably suffer from this kind of action in the future. The lessons of the past are a clear warning, so we must be careful," he said. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>French Pro-League of Nations Organizations Pass a Resolution; Rewarding Aggression Must Not Set a Bad Example</h3>
<p>Paris, The Joint Federation of French Pro-League of Nations Organizations recently passed a resolution expressing the hope that the Italian-Abyssinian War will end soon, stating, "The plan to resolve the dispute must be based on respect for the principles of the League of Nations' covenant and the collective security system, in order to have true value for genuine pacification." The final resolution demands that the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, "should not allow the aggressor to profit, leading to a bad precedent," he said. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Insatiable Desires; to Raise Important Reservations on the Peace Plan</h3>
<p>Rome, Diplomatic circles here indicated today that if Italy accepts the Anglo-French peace plan, it will also have various reservations, making the plan exist in name only. Observers say that Italy will oppose each important point one by one, so that the nature of the plan is completely changed. Mussolini will not make any decisions before the Fascist Cadre Conference on Wednesday. However, the following two reservations are likely to be insisted upon by him: (1) Italy cannot return the city of Aksum; (2) Italy cannot cede the port of Assab or the area connecting to that port. (3) There are still many dissatisfactions with the Italian sphere of influence in the southern part of Abyssinia mentioned in the plan. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>Roman Newspaper Changes Its Tone; Attacks Those Who Destroy the Peace Plan; Accuses Communism of Being the Cause</h3>
<p>Rome, While newspapers here vehemently attacked the Anglo-French peace plan yesterday, today the tone suddenly turned to strongly attacking those who attempt to destroy this plan, saying that the worldwide movement against the Anglo-French plan is caused by communism. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Trend of the League of Nations Regarding the Anglo-French Peace Plan; to be Submitted to the Political Council for Discussion Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Geneva, There were no new developments in the situation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute today. The Secretariat of the League of Nations has not yet received any replies from the Italian and Abyssinian governments regarding the plan proposed by Britain and France. It is rumored that Italian public opinion is no longer as optimistic as before about the possibility of an immediate resolution of the dispute. Delegates from various countries commented on this news, with varying opinions. The Administrative Council of the League of Nations has scheduled a meeting on the 18th, and representatives of the Council member states will arrive here one after another. However, it is not yet known whether Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov will attend the meeting. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Geneva, According to people here, Italy's reply to the peace plan will not be issued before Thursday or Friday. It is expected that when the League of Nations' Administrative Council meets on Wednesday to discuss the plan, it will delay its decision. There is reason to believe that at least five countries, namely Soviet Russia, Turkey, Romania, Denmark, and Spain, will abstain from voting. Poland's attitude is also very questionable. If the issue is submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly for a vote, there will certainly be several countries voting against it. A certain Latin American delegation has been instructed by its government that if the issue is submitted to the General Assembly, it should vote against it. Therefore, under these circumstances, the Administrative Council will probably appoint a special committee to study the entire issue in order to consider the situation and put forward new recommendations. This move will likely delay the expansion of the current sanctions against Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments on Anglo-French Proposal; Violates the Spirit of the League of Nations; Britain's Adoption of This Step Damages Its Prestige; Will Cause Serious Consequences in the Near East</h3>
<p>Moscow, Radek, a well-known political commentator in the Soviet Union, published an article in the "Izvestia" newspaper today, entitled "The League of Nations and the Partition of Abyssinia," stating, "The news that Britain and France have jointly proposed suggestions for Abyssinia, Italy, and the League of Nations is like a bomb exploding. The foreign ministers of Britain and France proposed that Italy and Abyssinia 'exchange territories,' which seems to completely maintain the 'principle of equality.' But in reality, Italy obtains half of Abyssinia's territory by one method or another, and what Abyssinia obtains is only an outlet on the Assab Sea and a corridor connecting to this outlet. In practice, Abyssinia has fallen into the hands of Italy. This proposal has caused huge indignation in the public opinion of both countries."</p>
<p>Radek elaborated on the positions of Britain and France in the Italian-Abyssinian conflict, pointing out that "The recent proposal of Britain and France is a leap along the policy that Britain and France have followed in the past. They have expressed a departure from the League of Nations General Assembly, because they are willing to violate the sovereignty of Abyssinia and the public opinion of several countries in the League of Nations in order to gain Italy's abandonment of its colonial war of aggression. At this time, the question of great political significance is, what are the reasons for Britain's adoption of such a step? Once this step is realized, it will be in a difficult position in the League of Nations. Even today, it has greatly reduced the prestige of the British government."</p>
<p>Radek described the events in North China and Egypt discussed by the Italian newspapers, forcing Great Britain to quickly extricate itself from the Abyssinian problem, and similar reports from other places, continuing, "Although the reasons for Britain's change of policy are not completely clear, it is known that the British government made this proposal because it firmly believes that the central part of Abyssinia can still not be seized. The British government has obviously taken into account that a written promise giving Italy huge rights will not be able to solve the problem. The question is whether Abyssinia is willing to make such concessions under the circumstances of this war. The British government has obviously taken into account that Italy will still fight with Abyssinia, and it still needs the material assistance of the great powers. Therefore, during the course of this dispute, various transactions can still be carried out.</p>
<p>"If we examine this policy of abandoning Abyssinia, which will make the entire situation in the East more complicated, we can foresee that Britain's calculations may be completely illusory. Abyssinia's struggle for independence has aroused huge sympathy from colored people in Africa, as well as Muslims in Arabia, Syria, and Palestine. The current policy of Great Britain will not be able to comfort this part of the world. If the Anglo-French proposal causes unfortunate incidents on the Abyssinian border, then the reverberations of the Abyssinian soldiers caused by this may lead to extremely serious consequences.</p>
<p>"Events have reached such a point that it is impossible to find a way out by relying solely on diplomatic negotiations at the expense of Abyssinia. We do not know what the future development of the facts will be, whether the British government will be forced to abandon its proposal, or whether this proposal will be opposed by the League of Nations. We also do not know what role France will play in future developments.</p>
<p>"The public opinion of the Soviet people has not changed. We still maintain a consistent attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian conflict. The Soviet Union supports the League of Nations' actions against aggression. This action has been recognized by 50 countries. We are unwilling to conduct any peace negotiations with the recognized aggressor, because we do not want to increase international difficulties. These peace negotiations must comply with the goals set by the League of Nations. The League of Nations has stipulated methods for maintaining peace, and when peace is violated, the League of Nations has also stipulated methods for forcing the aggressor to bear the complete territory and sovereign independence of the invaded country.</p>
<p>"The proposals made by Britain and France do not conform to the goal of protecting Abyssinia's territorial integrity and sovereign independence. Instead, they divide Abyssinia and reduce it to slavery. The League of Nations' General Assembly guarantees the independence and integrity of member states, and is not based on an assessment of the country's social situation and ethnic composition. Therefore, this worldwide proposal has no similarity to the goals of the League of Nations. On the contrary, it will directly harm this goal. The League of Nations can recognize Abyssinia's request to end the war, but it can never force Abyssinia to recognize any request, or put any pressure on it to yield." (TASS dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Expresses Its Views; Deeply Wary of Britain's Moves</h3>
<p>Tokyo, The contents of the Anglo-French compromise proposal to resolve the Anglo-Italian contention in East Africa by ceding Abyssinia's territory, that is, by ratifying Italy's aggression, was announced by the League of Nations Secretariat on the 13th. The small countries of the League of Nations are all opposed to the proposal, and it is only natural that the Abyssinian government rejected it. The British government, which is now forcibly promoting a compromise, is itself facing a large shadow on the fate of the Conservative cabinet due to domestic criticism. The Japanese government is paying close attention to the attitude of Britain and France towards Italy and watching the development of the situation. Therefore, it expressed its views on the 16th as follows:</p>
<p>Before the Conservative cabinet in the United States could re-establish its strong foreign policy, it encountered the anti-British movement in Egypt and the new developments of the situation in India and the North China problem. It is focusing on the East African problem, believing that maintaining its colonial interests overseas is the greatest crisis. On the one hand, if it enforces the East African policy in the European political situation, it will promote Italy's permanent anti-British movement and increase the atmosphere of cooperation between France and Italy. At the same time, it will become a policy that approves Germany's advance into Austria and fundamentally shakes the policy of maintaining the balance of the continent. Therefore, Britain's final policy is to sacrifice Abyssinia to end the East African problem, in order to ease Italy's attitude and re-establish the political and commercial finances of the East Africa, India, and the Red Sea. It is temporarily retreating to prepare for future advances. For small countries, upholding the League of Nations is essential to maintaining their own country. If Italy's act of aggression is ratified due to Britain's expediency, then the future invasion of their own territory will also have a recognized fate. Therefore, the two countries of Britain and France, in the name of the League of Nations, are ratifying Italy's act of aggression and forcibly implementing the so-called compromise plan, which is of course regarded as a matter of survival for the country at the moment, and the situation is extremely serious. As for the implementation of the compromise plan, there are still some difficulties in the future that can be foreseen. However, the fundamental principle of Britain's work to ease Italy is not only a retreat for Britain, but also a preparation for more development. Therefore, we must be fully vigilant about Britain's military disarmament issue and the work of determining the direction of the East Asian issue. (Jiji dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Southern Front; Italian Army Fiercely Attacks; No Significant Victory Achieved; 15 Aircraft Bombard Abyssinian Army Camp</h3>

<h3>U.S. Department of Commerce Announces Reason for London's Cease of Silver Purchases; States that Japanese Secretly Transporting Silver from Shanghai for Export is Indeed Very Active; Will Purchase More from Silver-Producing Countries in the Future</h3>
<p>Washington, In a periodic report published by the U.S. Department of Commerce today, it has officially acknowledged that there has indeed been unusual activity in silver in Shanghai for several months, and specifically mentioned the activities of the Japanese in buying silver and transporting it abroad. Private experts also believe that the private transportation of silver by foreign nationals is part of the reason why the U.S. Treasury Department stopped buying silver in London. For example, it is learned here that American officials paid close attention to the large amount of silver shipped from Japan to London in October and November, because a total of 51 million yen worth of silver was shipped in two months, while the total for the entire last year was only 14 million yen. Moreover, this silver was shipped to the UK before the Chinese government implemented the new currency system. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington, The Department of Commerce announced today that the United States purchased silver from as many as 58 countries in the past eleven months of this year, indicating that if Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau still wants to leave the London market and purchase from silver-producing countries, there are also many markets. According to the Department of Commerce report, the largest exporters of silver to the United States this year were the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Mexico, and Canada, but it stated that some of the sources were actually silver transferred from China.

<h3>Naval Conference Enters First Week; Japan Changes to Offensive; Aims to Achieve Naval Equality</h3>
<p>Tokyo, From the 16th, the First Committee of the Disarmament Conference will reduce the number of attendees from each country to form a working group. Moreover, since this week's meeting is the last consultation of the year, the outcome is quite noteworthy. The First Committee held four resolutions last week. One resolution was on private talks between Britain and Japan, the results of which only expressed a part of the opinions of countries such as Britain, Japan, and the United States. The future of the conference is still bleak. The Japanese delegation has consistently sought to thoroughly realize disarmament for the countermeasures of the second week's meeting, advocated the establishment of common maximum limits, explained the details of Japan's claims, corrected misunderstandings in various countries, and if the United Kingdom and the United States proposed to stop discussing quantitative issues and start discussing qualitative issues, Japan would still insist on first determining the quantitative issues. (Jiji dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London, The Japanese delegation decided to actively adopt an offensive attitude at this week's meeting, refuting the theory of differential military strength set by Britain and the United States, so that the first phase of the meeting before Christmas would be beneficial to Japan. Britain argued that it needed to protect its vast territory and important trade routes, and that it was necessary to fulfill the obligations of the League of Nations and other international treaties, and opposed Japan's demand for equality of military strength. The Japanese delegation refutes the basis of Britain's theory as follows: (1) If the theory of vulnerability applies to the British Empire, then the same theory should also apply to Japan, which bears a greater responsibility as a remote central country. (2) Britain relies on the vastness of its territory as the basis for its theory of vulnerability, but the vast territory is convenient for combat and easy to obtain bases, which in turn occupies an advantageous position in tactics. (3) Britain needs a strong navy to fulfill its international obligations, which proves that other countries can cooperate in the event of an incident. Japan cannot recognize this proposal of maintaining peace in isolation in the Far East. (Jiji dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Criticizes Japan for Destroying the Nine-Power Treaty; Naval Problems Have Not Been Separated from Politics; Expresses Anxiety About the Future of the London Conference</h3>
<p>New York, The New York Communication Daily expresses anxiety about Japan's attitude at the London Naval Conference, and points out that Japan deliberately destroys the Nine-Power Treaty that guarantees China's territorial and administrative integrity, saying that the Washington Conference of 1921 not only limited naval armaments, but also resolved political disputes involving the Pacific and the Asian continent, a point that Japan has brazenly ignored or concealed. The Nine-Power Treaty, as part of a joint agreement, is openly destroyed by Japan and it is now beginning its political business of aggression in Asia. The naval problem was not separated from politics in 1921, and it remains so today. The most disturbing thing is not Japan's stubborn insistence on the principle of naval equality, but the success of Japan in passing its naval plans in political meetings. If Japan must pursue a policy of destruction, then it is better for Western countries to have no treaty to limit naval forces than to have one, but to allow Japan the same tonnage is to directly recognize Japan's superior position in the Pacific, starting from Alaska and ending in Australia.

<h3>U.S. Congressional Delegation Returns Home and Discusses the Prospects of the Philippines: Believes in the Ability to Organize a Strong Government; Japan's Annexation of Land Difficult to Digest for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Seattle - The U.S. Congressional delegation that attended the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth Government in Manila returned home today. Five U.S. Navy aircraft escorted the President Johnson, the ship carrying the delegation, into the port of Seattle. Crowds gathered at the pier to welcome them. After the ship docked, the congressmen and journalists disembarked. Speaker of the House Byrns, representing the delegation, spoke about the prospects for the Philippines, saying that if the Philippine government could develop freely, it would certainly achieve independence. The leaders of the Philippines are strong and capable of organizing a powerful government. Republican Senator Nye scoffed at rumors of Japanese aggression in the Philippines, saying that the Filipino people are capable of defending their freedom and that the possibility of Japanese aggression is exaggerated. Japan does not need to seize the Philippines at present, as the land Japan is currently trying to digest has already exceeded its appetite. Vice President Garner remained silent, only saying that someone in Washington had already spoken on their behalf. Republican Senator Gillette believes that the Filipino people will never achieve independence. The Filipinos may ask the United States to take back its decision and allow them to become a protectorate of the United States. He does not believe that the Filipinos truly desire independence. Without the guidance of the United States, they will never be able to compete in world trade. Their goods exported to the United States will be subject to the same tariffs as foreign goods. Even with the current tariff of three cents per pound on coconut oil, the Filipinos will only be able to eke out a living. (National Press Agency Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>France Establishes a Factory to Produce Artificial Petroleum</h3>
<p>Paris - A factory for the production of artificial petroleum and gasoline recently opened in Béthune, northern France. Another factory in Liévin is still under construction. This type of factory is the first of its kind to be established in France, but its nature is only experimental. The manufacturing process uses coal as a raw material, but the coal produced in France is insufficient and must be imported from abroad. The petroleum and gasoline used are also supplied from abroad. If coal is purchased from abroad and then refined into petroleum or gasoline at great cost, there is no commercial benefit to speak of. Furthermore, import taxes on petroleum generate hundreds of millions of francs in revenue each year. Once the product is manufactured domestically, this tax revenue will disappear, which is an obstacle from a fiscal perspective. However, for coal-producing countries such as England and Germany, the artificial method is extremely beneficial. The method is called the "Hydrogenation" process, invented in 1913 by the famous German chemist Friedrich Bergius. It has been improved many times and is now fully developed. To date, the German General Electric Company has produced a total of one million tons of artificial petroleum. A factory in Billingham, England, can produce 150,000 tons annually. According to the "Hydrogenation" method, bituminous coal is combined with hydrogen at a temperature of 400 to 500 degrees Celsius and high atmospheric pressure, resulting in the refining of petroleum, various light oils, and gas. There are also methods for directly extracting these products from coal, but they produce more residue. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Science Miscellany Edited by the Chinese Science Society Animals and Life (Continued) By Bing Zhi</h3>
<p>In the broadest sense of zoology, all aspects of human life are included within this field. Humans are inherently one of the animals. The reason they rise above all creatures and become masters of the world is that their brains are particularly developed, unmatched by any other animal. Consequently, their abilities surpass all other animals. They possess the genius to create culture, control global power, and evolve over tens of millions of years, ultimately shaping the world as it is today. Among animals, some may flourish for a time, dominating the Earth, but due to sudden environmental changes, their physical structures become unsuitable. Their nervous systems have not developed to a fully complete extent. Therefore, their brains cannot adequately cope with the environment, leading to significant difficulties in their survival. As environmental pressure intensifies, these animals find it increasingly difficult to adapt. Consequently, every environmental factor poses an extreme danger to them. These animals are destined to become extinct. Looking at the species discussed in paleontology, countless have become extinct and left no descendants. Many ancient hominids have also become extinct. Therefore, any organism that can survive today must be adept at adapting to the environment. Today, human competition is becoming increasingly fierce. Some nations with weaker capabilities cannot create culture or organize powerful states. Unfortunately, when they come into contact with strong and aggressive nations, they are subjected to plunder, slaughter, loss of land, loss of natural resources, loss of autonomy, and loss of opportunities for survival. Some are conquered, enslaved, or exterminated. The tragedy of humans harming each other is even worse than that of various animals, revealing that the vicious nature of humans is no different from that of ferocious beasts. The evolution of human civilization is extremely slow, and the world today still retains vestiges of its earliest barbarity. If a nation is uncivilized and lacks the ability to create culture, it is because its inherent qualities are too inferior to resist stronger nations, and its extinction is not surprising. What is most incomprehensible is that nations with thousands of years of cultural development, which have achieved pioneering successes, repeatedly suffer setbacks when encountering other nations and cannot recover. Gradually, disaster looms, and destruction is imminent, creating a sense of impending doom. This is mainly because the people lack basic scientific knowledge and are unaware of the phenomena of animal survival. Initially, due to a lack of education, people in today's era of fierce national competition have not developed the qualities, knowledge, and skills required of independent citizens. As a result, their ingrained habits of apathy and their base nature of self-interest without regard for the nation make it difficult to adapt to today's environment. They repeatedly suffer, and the degree of corruption deepens along with it. These people are little different from the lowest animals, but the dangers of their environment are thousands of times greater than those faced by lower animals. How can they escape natural selection? However, humans possess a healthy brain unmatched by any animal and can utilize this brain to create culture, with thousands of years of history. If they make good use of their inherent strengths, observe the phenomena of animal survival, deeply consider the inevitability of natural laws, and awaken themselves to self-help and self-rescue, they may survive. Among animals, such as crows and ducks, there is an ability to unite in groups. Crows choose places to forage and migrate, often moving in groups. When they gather in one place, they always have designated members responsible for warning others. Therefore, when a group of crows gathers, one or two crows keep watch, and if they spot an approaching enemy, they will sound an alarm to alert their companions, hoping to avoid the tragedy of being captured and killed. If they encounter a wounded companion on the way who cannot fly forward, the crows will protect it closely, or try their best to move it to a safe place, hoping for its recovery. Ducks also like to live in groups. Every night, when they perch on the water, they form a circle, with each duck's feet intertwined and its head facing outward. If an enemy approaches, one place will detect it first, and when one duck is startled, all the ducks will know, thus preserving their group. This ability to unite in groups greatly benefits their species. Nations that are declining and failing to protect their compatriots, being used by others, and killing each other should take this as a warning. Among animals, such as bees and ants, there is an ability to cooperate. The division of labor within their groups is well-organized, with some specializing in foraging to feed their group, some specializing in building nests to shelter their group, some specializing in defense to protect their leaders and resist foreign enemies, and some specializing in reproduction to perpetuate their species. Each specialist is dedicated to public service, striving to fulfill their duties, and completely prioritizing the interests of the group over their own selfish concerns. Their spirit of cooperation is highly developed, and their species is able to thrive as a result. Nations that are deeply corrupted, that do not love their country, and that only know how to pursue selfish interests should feel ashamed and repent. Among animals, such as several types of insects, there is no ability to be self-reliant. They rely on parasitizing other animals to reproduce. As a result, the host suffers, and the parasite itself degenerates greatly, with various organs gradually disappearing. There is no limit to the extent of their future degeneration. These animals can never return to a position of self-reliance. Nations that are dependent and do not know how to strive for survival, relying solely on the assistance of others, should take this as a warning. Among animals, such as several types of fish in shallow seas, in the warm weather of spring, they gather on the coast and fight over females, nests, or food. In extreme cases of fighting, they rupture intestines, sever necks, break foreheads, and gouge out eyes, and the number of those who lose their lives is enormous. Once sharks and whales suddenly arrive, their huge mouths gape open, devouring everything. Countless members of the same species fighting each other endlessly are buried in the enemy's belly in an instant without realizing it. Nations that are good at harming themselves, only knowing how to pursue their own selfish views, disregarding the imminent disaster, and still holding each other back when enemies have already spied on their inner sanctums should often reflect on this. Animals that do not know how to help each other will have difficulty surviving as a species, while those that can help each other can reproduce as a species. Darwin has spoken of this, and Kropotkin has described it in even greater detail. Humans are the most intelligent of all creatures. They can command all animals because their brains are particularly developed, allowing them to unite in groups, help each other, divide labor, cooperate, independently seek survival, and create and develop the world's culture. They should further cultivate their original advantages to encourage themselves, utilize various animals as resources to enrich the nation and benefit the people, and more importantly, deeply understand the meaning of zoology, quietly observe the phenomena of the survival and decline of various animals, and promote the development of patriotic ideas.</p>
<h3>Presidents of Various Universities in Beiping Urge Students to Return to Class Jointly Issue a Letter to Students, Saying the Goal of the Petition Has Been Achieved</h3>
<p>Beiping News, 14th. Since the students of various universities in Beiping stopped classes on the 9th, they have not returned to class as of yesterday. Yesterday at noon, Xu Songming, President of Beiping University; Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University; Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University; Li Zheng, President of Normal University; Li Linyu, President of Sino-French University; Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University, and others held a luncheon at the European and American Alumni Association in Qiqing. During the luncheon, they had a detailed discussion on the issue of preventing students from various schools from returning to class. In addition to each school finding ways to persuade students on their own, they also jointly issued a letter to students, urging them to return to class immediately. After the meeting, they immediately went to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Qin Dechun. Mr. Qin personally received them. The authorities of various schools inquired about the current situation and expressed their opinions. Mr. Qin agreed to inform the Public Security Bureau to handle the matter and explained in detail the current situation in North China. The authorities of various schools left at about 5 o'clock. The original text of the letter to the students is recorded below: "Dear students, news about students has not been widely published in newspapers in recent days, leading to numerous rumors. Everyone feels the pain of not understanding the truth. We are willing to tell you what happened. There were no female students injured or killed during the Beiping student parade on the 9th. The most popular rumor recently is that a female student was stabbed to death by the police on Wangfujing Street during the parade on the 9th. The student's registration was said to be from Normal University or Girls' No. 1 Middle School. The location of the female student's death was said to be at the Municipal Hospital or Xiehe Hospital. However, according to reports from the acting principals of Normal University and Girls' No. 1 Middle School, there were no female students injured or killed in these two schools. According to a report from Wang, the director of Xiehe Hospital, a female student suffered a minor head injury on the 9th, and after receiving treatment, she was discharged from the hospital immediately. No female students were injured or killed at the Municipal Hospital. As for the rumors circulating in various schools in the city that Tsinghua students were injured or killed, it has been verified that this is also not true. All the students arrested in recent days have been completely released. A total of three students from Beiping University, six students from Northeastern University, and three students from Peking University were arrested during the Beiping student parade on the 9th. Xu Songming, the president of Beiping University, bailed them out the next day. Twelve students from Northeastern University were arrested on suspicion of injuring police officers. Now, after Wang Zhuoran, the acting president, strongly guaranteed them, they were completely released on the 13th. Minister He Yingqin's condolences to the students in Beiping. Minister He went south yesterday. Before leaving, he wrote a farewell letter to the university presidents, in which he included a few words of condolence to the students. It is now recorded on the left: 'Regarding the situation in Hebei and Chahar, I have been meeting with local authorities for several days, and the progress has been very good. Now, the Central Government has clearly ordered the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, which is responsible for the overall management of the political affairs of Hebei, Chahar, Beiping, and Tianjin. The authorities here are all rich in national thinking. Changes in personnel do not affect the unity of the country. I hope that the teachers will convey to the students that they must bury their heads and work hard in their studies and not get involved in extracurricular activities. All students are rich in patriotic spirit. Therefore, only by working hard to improve their knowledge can they actually benefit the country. All students are young people with deep knowledge, and I believe they can all understand this.'" Looking at the above news, it can be said that the goal of the students' strike has been achieved. We hope that the students will not create unnecessary complications, not waste time, immediately resume their studies, and work hard to cultivate themselves to become useful talents. In the future, they will definitely achieve the greatest results in the cause of saving the country. Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University; Xu Songming, President of Beiping University; Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University; Li Zheng, President of Normal University; Wang Zhuoran, Acting President of Northeastern University; Lu Zhiwei, President of Yenching University.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Japanese and Korean People Travel to the Interior of Henan Province Most of Them Come From Pingjin, Shandong, Hebei The Purpose is to Investigate or Survey</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence. For more than a month, Japanese people have been traveling along the Pinghan, Longhai, and Daoqing Railways, either for investigation, survey, or secret work. The following is a brief record of the relevant news:</p>
<p>Western Henan. Most of the Japanese who go to western Henan aim to visit Luoyang. Recently, the Japanese who have passed through Zhengzhou to Luoyang include Japanese Keigorō, Korean Kim Jeong-cheong, Japanese Tanaka Kiyoketsurō, Hojo Hohei, Mr. and Mrs. Masui Tsuneo. In the Menseki (west of Luoyang) area, Japanese travelers have also been discovered, and many of them are disguised. At the beginning of last month, two Japanese, Kataoka Akira and Wada Tadaomi, disguised as workers, crossed the river (Yellow River) from Yuanqu, Shanxi, to the sixth district of Shin-ike County, hired two donkeys to go to the county seat. When they arrived at the station, the local police, suspecting their behavior, came forward for a thorough questioning. They each presented their business cards and passports. The passports stated "Permission to travel to Jigong Mountain, Henan" (Note: This mountain is in southern Henan). They also carried a camera. According to the donkey driver, the two Japanese took many photos along the way. In southern Henan, a continuous stream of Japanese and Korean people have recently arrived in the Xuchang area. It is said that they came to Xuchang from Pingjin, Jinan, Hebei, and other places, or passed through Xuchang to go south for business. Their names are as follows: Maeda Ketsurō, Tai Yongsanrō, Bando Takatarō, Takada Kōkichi, Wakamatsu Hidekichi, Nakayama Saburō, Matsuhisa Masao, Zheng Lirong, Choi Chung-jik, Son Byeong-won, Jeon Seong-gil, Cha Gwang-hwan, Choi Sang-won, Kakuda Ketsurō, Ogawa Tarō, Yoshida Tarō, Yamamoto Ichirō, Itada Ketsurō, Kim Il-gwang, Cha Jang-hwan, Suzuki, Lee Kyung-do, Matsumoto, Zhao Yunfu, Kim Won-chan, Iwashiki, Lee Hae-san, Kim Song-am, Rodarō, Kim Jwa-sang, Ma Sang-bu, Lim Il-san, Lee Tae-chang, Choi Deuk-san, Jang Seong-dae, Jung Il-san, Yamada, Kim Byeong-tarō, Inoue Yoshikichi, Maeda Yoshio, Yoshioka Katsushi, Saitō Kōhei, Kaneko Yoshiki, Yamada Hidematsu, Gwon Chun-il, Kon Manabu, Itada Ichirō, Wang Qingshan.</p>
<p>Northern Henan. Most of the Japanese who go to northern Henan aim for Xinxiang, Anyang, and Jiaozuo. Xinxiang is the intersection of the Pinghan and Daoqing Railways. Jiaozuo and Anyang have huge coal mines. The following is a record of the recent Japanese and Korean people who have passed through Zhengzhou to northern Henan: Hirayama Isamu (Japanese consulate staff in Zhengzhou), Luo Fason, Yasuhara Takeo, Nakamura Tomei, Noda Seiji, Isoda Tarō, Sashiza Tarō, Kizaki Mi, Tada Ketsurō. In addition, many Koreans have passed through Zhengzhou to the north, including Choi Seung-jeong, Lim Ryong-un, Lee Geum-san, Jeon Hyo-seong, Kim Jeong-jin, and Jang Cheol-hyeon. However, most of the Koreans are related to the purchase of cash. When North China was at its most critical, an incident occurred in Jiaozuo in which Japanese demanded vehicles from the Daoqing Railway to transport coal.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Stores Grain to Prepare for Famine</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Purchase Miscellaneous Grain Seeds for Distribution Another Appropriation from the Treasury to Subsidize Counties in Establishing Granaries</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. Recently, the Guangdong Province government, due to the province's inability to be self-sufficient in food and the ever present emergency in international affairs, has ordered all counties to vigorously carry out winter cultivation and plant miscellaneous grains after the late rice harvest. Rice planting will be doubled next spring. Barren fields in all counties must be reclaimed and cultivated and not left fallow. For farmland affected by floods and droughts, where farmers are bankrupt and unable to resume cultivation, the government will allocate funds to purchase rice and miscellaneous grain seeds and distribute them to farmers for planting. The Department of Civil Affairs recently received a total of 5,500 yuan in the seventh and eighth installments of disaster relief funds from the Central Relief Commission, which was submitted to the Provincial Government for distribution. It was then submitted to the 44th Provincial Affairs Meeting for approval. The funds were used to purchase miscellaneous grain seeds. It is now found that the funds are insufficient. Therefore, all the remaining 7,000 yuan from the salary donations of civil servants in various agencies in the province were raised, and another 20,000 yuan of public funds were allocated by the Department of Finance, totaling 33,000 yuan. All of the funds were allocated to purchase miscellaneous grain seeds and rice seeds. The Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance jointly formulated distribution measures and ordered the county governments to send personnel to the province to collect them for distribution to farmers in various villages for use. In the future, each county will be limited to one county granary, which will be purchased and stored according to the size of the county to prepare for emergencies. There are more than 80 counties in the province. Currently, 25 county granaries have been established, and 59 county granaries have not yet been established. However, in poor counties, local tax revenues are mostly insufficient to cover local administrative expenses, and construction costs are not easy to raise temporarily. Since the county granaries have not been established, it naturally affects the progress of grain storage. According to the investigation, only one-third of the counties in the province are currently building granaries to store grain, with a total of only 42,790 dan of rice stored. In order to expedite the construction of granaries, the authorities have allocated funds from the provincial treasury in installments to subsidize the counties in building county granaries. It is reported that the first installment of 100,000 yuan has been allocated to the Grain Regulation Committee to assess the grain production situation in each county and determine the urgency of establishing granaries. It has been verified that the first installment of 100,000 yuan has been ordered by the provincial government to be allocated by the Department of Finance according to the amount to facilitate progress.

<p>Baoshan Fresh Meat Merchants Oppose Increased Taxes and Go on Strike</p>
<p>The Baoshan County meat tax has always been contracted by the county's Meat Industry Association, and then the tax is individually assigned to each meat merchant. Now, due to the sluggish market, the amount of tax assigned is often insufficient. This time, merchants were invited to bid again, and Wang Jin won the contract with a price increase of more than 100 yuan. Mr. Wang believes that the tax amount assigned to the meat merchants is insufficient, so disregarding the suffering of the merchants and the people, he plans to collect taxes on a per-head basis as usual. The industry heard about this and unanimously opposed it, stating that at a time when the rural economy is bankrupt and purchasing power is very weak, it is impossible to bear this heavy burden. Li Xiceng, the representative of the association, negotiated with the contractor, Wang Jin, several times, but there was no result. The collection of taxes on a per-head basis is bound to be implemented. The industry had no choice but to go on strike from the previous day to show resistance, and hoped for assistance from all sectors.</p>
<p>Wuxi Business Group Follows Orders to Change to Outpost</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce held its 20th joint meeting of executive and supervisory committees on the 15th, chaired by Yang Hanxi. It was resolved that: 1. A branch office will be established in Zhangjing Bridge. A letter will be sent to the association requesting personnel to provide guidance. A letter has been sent to Mr. Jiang Zhongliang inviting him to provide guidance. 2. The Chamber of Commerce previously organized a Business Group Management Committee. Now, the Business Group has been ordered to be abolished and changed to an outpost. All Business Group Management Committees will be abolished from today and reported to the government for record. The affairs of the Business Group will still be handled by the original Business Group Association.</p>
<p>Yangzhou The Xianshao Section Will Be Built Immediately</p>
<p>The Xianshao section of the Yangjing-Yangqing Second Road connection line has been decided to be contracted by the Department of Construction and will be built immediately. It is now learned that the relocation of all houses and graves along the road will be handled by Li Wenhan, the engineer in charge of the section, who will send a letter to the Fourth District Office, ordering the township chiefs to notify the owners of the houses and graves along the road to relocate them by a certain date. As for the subsidies, 10 yuan per brick house and 5 yuan per thatched house, and 2 yuan per grave with an owner, should be investigated and compiled by the township chiefs into a clear list. The Fourth District Office will forward the list to the section's project office for verification. If the figures match, the list will be submitted to the Construction Department for verification and issuance, which will then be forwarded by the county government for collection.</p>
<p>Hangzhou The Nanyu Section Will Open on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Nanyu section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been largely completed. Only the two major bridges, Liangjiadu and Guixi, need to be completed by the 25th of this month. The entire section will be test-driven on the 28th, and business will begin on New Year's Day. The opening ceremony will be held on a later date. As for the large batch of vehicles ordered from the German Materials Company, including 60 freight cars, 14 passenger cars, and 6 locomotives, they should be delivered in February. Electric railcars are too expensive, costing more than 200,000 yuan per car, so their purchase will be postponed.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>On the 10th of this month, your newspaper's second page, sixth edition, published a news item about the Qingdao to Lianyungang joint sea-land transportation project, stating that the Zhengji Shipping Company had signed a joint transportation contract with our railway. Upon investigation, the Qingdao Zhengji Shipping Company is only registered with our railway for permission to dock at the wharf and load non-joint transportation goods. As for companies that handle joint sea-land transportation, there are no other shipping companies besides the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The aforementioned news item does not conform to the facts. I hope you will investigate and correct it.

<h3>United National Salvation Movement Launched by Various Schools and Organizations in This City</h3>
<p>Universities Strive to Unify Organizations, Various Groups Apply to Punish Rebels, Unified National Salvation Movement Organization</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports: Since the puppet autonomous movement in North China occurred, students from various universities in this city have been organizing student national salvation associations, sending telegrams of opposition, and responding to the patriotic movement of students in Beiping. To streamline procedures and concentrate efforts, representatives from student unions and national salvation associations of various universities held a discussion at Jiaotong University at 3 PM yesterday, deciding on the future direction of national salvation, rejecting the University National Salvation Federation, and unifying student national salvation organizations. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yang Xunzheng, representing the student self-government association of Jiaotong University; Hu Zining, Teng Bingshu, Yu Tieqian, Ma Rensong, and Tian Zhi, representing the student national salvation association of Guanghua University; Nie Zaili, Hu Jiaodian, Shen Shuzhi, and Xiao Qizhi, representing the student national salvation association of Chih Tze College; Cheng Yuantao and Ji Hanzhang, representing the student union of the Soochow University Law School; Li Qingxin, Dai Zhaoming, Li Kuandu, and Ge Ze, representing the Jinnan University national salvation association against the North China autonomous movement; Peng Shuxin, Wei Dingyi, Li Weizhong, and Zhong Huanxin, representing the student self-government association of Daxia University; Huang Chengduo and Ling Songjiao, representing the students of Shanghai College of Commerce.</p>
<p>Key Resolutions: Chairman Hu Zining of Guanghua University, Recorder Cheng Yuanzhen of Soochow University. Matters discussed: How to determine the future direction of national salvation. Resolved: (A) Unify student national salvation organizations of various universities in Shanghai; (B) In future national salvation movements, strive for sustainability and practicality. It has been reported in recent days that there is a so-called Shanghai University Student National Salvation Federation. However, various universities had no prior knowledge of this, and did not send representatives to attend. Furthermore, the records of the association did not include the meeting address or the names of the attending representatives. This organization, which falsely borrows a name, is clearly illegal and should not be recognized. How should this be handled? Resolved: (A) Send a letter to various newspapers and news agencies in this city, declaring non-recognition (the declaration letter is attached below); (B) Send a letter to the party and government organs in this city, requesting a thorough investigation; (C) Send a letter to the student self-government associations and national salvation associations of various universities, declaring non-recognition. How to unify the student national salvation movement of various universities in this city? Resolved: Each school attending the meeting should inform the secretary of the previous university league to convene representatives from various universities in the near future to discuss implementation.</p>
<p>Declaration Letter: Respected Sirs, It has been reported in recent days that there is an organization called the Shanghai University Student National Salvation Federation. After investigation, the formal student organization representing the entire school, such as our school, has no representatives attending. Furthermore, the records of the association published in recent days do not include the names of the attending representatives or the meeting location. This is clearly a case of falsely borrowing a name and spreading rumors. In addition to separately writing to the party and government organs requesting a thorough investigation, we hereby send a special letter declaring non-recognition. We hope this will be published to avoid confusing the public. Furthermore, any news regarding our school must have the signature and seal of the formal organization and its responsible person to be valid. We hope you will take this into consideration. Sincerely, Student Self-Government Association of Jiaotong University, National Salvation Association Against the North China Autonomous Movement of Jinnan University, Student National Salvation Association of Guanghua University, Student Self-Government Association of Daxia University, Student Union of the Law School of Soochow University, Student National Salvation Association of Chih Tze College, Student Union of National Shanghai College of Commerce. December 16th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee, in view of the approaching closing date for various businesses, has determined that, apart from banks and money shops that have made sufficient preparations and are not at risk, most other industrial and commercial firms are difficult to maintain due to the sluggish market and weak purchasing power of the people. In order to provide the utmost support, the committee has decided at its 17th meeting to provide small credit loans to relieve industry and commerce. It is reported that in recent days, industrial and commercial firms have been actively inquiring about loan procedures and obtaining loan application forms.</p>

<p>Granting Small Credit Loans as Much as Possible: Three Banks Permitted to Rediscount</p>
<p>The closing date for various businesses in this city is approaching. The Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee has decided to grant small credit loans as much as possible to provide relief to industry and commerce. Various banks are permitted to rediscount accepted bills to activate the financial market. A reporter from the Industrial News Agency has investigated and recorded the following details:</p>
<p>Loan Committee Members Exert All Efforts to Provide Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee, in view of the approaching closing date for various businesses, has determined that, apart from banks and money shops that have made sufficient preparations and are not at risk, most other industrial and commercial firms are difficult to maintain due to the sluggish market and weak purchasing power of the people. In order to provide the utmost support, the committee has decided at its 17th meeting to provide small credit loans to relieve industry and commerce. All applications under one hundred yuan must continue to be approved. It is reported that in recent days, industrial and commercial firms have been actively inquiring about loan procedures and obtaining loan application forms.</p>
<p>Three Banks Permitted to Rediscount Cloths</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Silk Industry Association promoted commercial acceptance bills, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Training Industry Association have also followed suit and promoted it. Both industry and commerce have benefited greatly in terms of economic flow. Subsequently, the National Great Alliance Association, the National Goods Factory Federation, and others successively submitted requests to the Ministry of Finance for approval to handle discount and rediscount, and requested the transfer of orders to the silver and money industries to comply with and implement them to provide relief. At that time, the Ministry of Finance first ordered the Central Bank to handle rediscount, and at the same time sought opinions from the silver and money industries. Recently, according to reporters' inquiries, the Central Bank has approved the rediscount of accepted bills for relief purposes. The other two banks, China and Communications, have also been approved to handle it, so the financial situation in the market has gradually become active, and industry and commerce can count on weathering the difficulties. As for the direct discount procedures, the silver and money industries will soon be officially implemented.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Prepare to Overcome Difficulties: The operations of various industrial and commercial firms have been extremely sluggish. Their situation is far worse than today two years ago. The number of businesses closing and liquidating is increasing every day. Industry giants Yu Qiaqing, Rong Zongjing, Liu Hongsheng, Nie Lusheng, and others have jointly submitted a request to the Central Government to quickly determine a relief plan for various industries. The Central Government is now actively working on it. However, the annual severe general closing is imminent. In view of the current difficulties, industry and commerce themselves should immediately resolve, expedite the collection of outstanding debts for various closings, and at the same time reduce credit accounts, concentrate cash as much as possible, and prepare to overcome this future difficult obstacle.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Education Sends Letters to Various Schools, Urging Students to Refrain from Parades</h3>
<p>Ardent Patriotism Can Be Expressed Through Written Opinions: Do Not Indulge in Momentary Righteous Indignation and Take Useless Actions</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education of this city recently sent letters to schools of higher and secondary education in this city, including Jinan, Daxia, Jiaotong, Fudan, Datong, Guanghua, Hujiang, Aurora, Tongji, Soochow, Chih Tze, Law School, Political Science College, College of Commerce, Medical College, Southeast Medical College, and Sino-French Institute of Technology, stating: Although the situation in North China is tense, the government's foreign policy has long been determined. Any attempt to lose national sovereignty or divide the territory will not be easily tolerated. Students are the foundation of the nation's vitality. Their ardent patriotism is commendable. However, at a time when the nation is facing many difficulties, engaging in parades and demonstrations out of righteous indignation will only disrupt local order and lead to international disputes, diverting the attention of the government, which is working tirelessly to address the situation, and preventing it from responding effectively to foreign affairs. This will not benefit the country or the people. Faculty and students of various schools, if you have any opinions out of patriotism, you can submit them in writing to the government for consideration. Do not indulge in momentary righteous indignation and take useless actions. This is of utmost importance. In addition to sending separate orders, we hereby send this letter, hoping that your school will understand and earnestly encourage students to share this understanding. After receiving the letter, the schools have informed the students separately to comply. Reporters visited various schools yesterday and observed that students were attending classes as usual, and the order was very good.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Twelve Other Organizations Hold a Farewell Luncheon for Cunningham Today</h3>
<p>A Tea Party at the International Hotel from 5 to 7 PM</p>
<p>American Consul General to Shanghai Cunningham is retiring and returning to his country. He is scheduled to take the President Lincoln of the Dollar Steamship Company on the 21st with his family to leave Shanghai. Since Mr. Cunningham has been stationed in Shanghai for many years and has a very harmonious relationship with all parties, various circles in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, have been hosting banquets to bid him farewell and express their well-wishes in recent days. It is learned that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession, the Bankers' Association, the Money Dealers' Association, the International Trade Association, the International Problems Research Association, the Federation of Universities, the World Student Association, the Returned Students Association from the United States, the World Society, and the Youth Association, 12 organizations in total, will hold a grand tea party at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road from 5 to 7 PM today to bid farewell to Mr. Cunningham and invite prominent figures from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, to accompany him. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that retiring U.S. Consul-General to Shanghai, Mr. K. Mihan, has served in China for more than twenty years, and recently resolved to return to the country. In recent days, friendly friends and groups have been holding banquets to celebrate the evening. The directors of the Bureau of Works also held a banquet at the Cathay Hotel. Mr. Ke has scheduled to depart by the president of Lin at 4:20 on the morning of Saturday this week and return to his American homeland. I think that at that time, Chinese and foreign friends gathered at Jiang Gan to welcome the people, and it was very lively for a while.</p>
<h3>News of the British Economic Envoy Ross's Visit to Beijing</h3>
<p>The Date of Return to the Country is Still Undecided</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British Economic Envoy, returned to Shanghai from Ping and suddenly caught a cold. It is learned that he has been resting quietly in his residence for several days and has recovered. He now plans to travel to Beijing by car tomorrow with his assistant B. Rogers and others to visit Chairman Chiang. He will return to Shanghai after a short stay. According to the Commercial Counselor of the British Embassy, George, who spoke to the New Voice News Agency yesterday morning, the date of Sir Ross's return to the country has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News says that the British government economic advisor, Sir Ross, who came to China to investigate the economic situation, suddenly caught a cold after returning to Shanghai from North China and has recovered slightly. However, he still does not see guests, and his wife is also suffering from a severe cold and is bedridden. This is probably because of the sudden change from the dry, cold land in the north to the humid, cold land in the north. It is said that the knighthood does not intend to leave Shanghai temporarily and will probably stay for a long time before going to South China to complete his investigation mission. It has not yet been decided whether to visit Japan again before leaving the Far East.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Donates 40,000 Pieces of Clothing to Shanghai</h3>

It has now raised 70,000 pieces of clothing, which will be shipped to Shanghai in two batches. The first batch, totaling 40,000 pieces, was entrusted to the Chinese Navy's Ding'an transport ship yesterday to be shipped to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in port in the next few days.

<h3>Ye Zhuotang Succeeds as Director of the Central Trust Bureau</h3>

Moreover, according to regulations, a minister cannot hold the position of director of another bureau. As for the successor, it is rumored that it has been internally determined that Ye Zhuotang will take the position. Zhang Gongquan had already obtained Ye's consent when he was in Shanghai. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance will formally announce the appointment within days.</p>

<h3>Three National Goods Groups Resolve to Hold a "National Goods Year" for Citizens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>To Schedule a Preparatory Committee Meeting for Various Groups on the 20th and Hold a Propaganda Conference on New Year's Day Next Year</p>
<p>The National Goods Movement Committee of the First Special District Citizens' Union of Shanghai, the China National Products Manufacturers' Federation, and the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Consumption Association and other three groups held a joint meeting at the Citizens' Union of Tianhougong Bridge at 4 PM yesterday. Zhang Qingyun, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jiufeng, Wei Mingxuan, Zhang Xianfang, Wang Jingdong, Liu Zhongying, Chen Binghui, Wang Hanqiang, Xu Jutang, Ge Futian, Liang Gengshun, Li Aokui, Zheng Dongshan, Zhu Zhichun and other twenty people attended the event, with Zhang Qingyun as the chairman and Zheng Dongshan as the recorder. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that promoting domestic goods is everyone's duty. Although domestic goods have been promoted over the years, the huge number of imported goods from abroad is very sad. If we do not make great efforts to promote domestic goods and promote the consumption of domestic goods, there is no way to recover the overflowing of the interests of the state and block the great leakage of the state. Last year was the so-called Women's National Goods Year, and this year was the so-called Students' National Goods Year, but it has passed. Next year should be named the Citizens' National Goods Year. Please express your opinions and discuss the measures. It was decided that: The year 1936 of the Republic of China shall be named the Citizens' National Goods Year. Chen Jiufeng will be responsible for drafting the outline of the organization. The three groups will be the promoters. The three groups will send letters to various groups to solicit representatives to participate in the preparation. The citizens' national goods year campaign conference shall be held on New Year's Day in the Republic of China in 1936 to promote the consumption of domestic goods. The matter shall be submitted to the party and government organs for the record. Liu Zhongying and Zheng Dongshan were appointed to prepare for the New Year's Day National Goods Consumption Movement Conference. The meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3>The Authorities of the Bureau of Works Hold a Farewell Party for Cunningham</h3>
<p>Mr. Cunningham, the former Consul-General of the United States in Shanghai, is retiring due to old age and will return to his country soon. The Chinese and foreign authorities in the port have held banquets to bid farewell to him. The Public Concession's Bureau of Works held a farewell party for Mr. Ke at the China-Europe Hotel yesterday. In addition to Mr. Ke, the guests included the Norwegian Consul General Ers, the Secretary of the Shanghai Consular Council, Mr. Lang, and the General Manager of the Bureau of Works, Mr. Fei Xindun. The hosts included the Directors of the Bureau of Works, including General Director Arnold, Director Canai, Chen Zeqing, Franklin, Guo Shun, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Gillerly, Lan Mu, Liddell, Bode, Zhan Bu, Yamamoto, and Yu Qiaqing. During the meeting, Chairman Arnold gave a speech, praising Mr. Ke's various efforts during his tenure as Consul General in Shanghai and leader of the Consular Corps. Since Mr. Ke arrived in Shanghai in September 1919, he served as Chairman of the Consular Council in 1925. In April of the following year, he was elected as the leader of the Consular Corps. During the Shanghai Incident in 1932, Mr. Ke was the chairman of the Sino-Japanese Armistice Joint Conference. In July 1933, Mr. Ke should have retired according to law. However, the President of the United States specifically extended Mr. Ke's term, believing that Mr. Ke had been in Shanghai for many years and understood the situation well. Therefore, Mr. Ke's personality is not only loved by foreigners, but also deeply admired by Chinese citizens. In 1933, various groups in Shanghai jointly sent a telegram to the U.S. Department of State to retain Mr. Ke's continued tenure. In addition to consular affairs, Mr. Ke also exerted his utmost efforts to assist in charity and public welfare undertakings in the port, hoping to achieve success. Therefore, Mr. Ke has been a praised word by all circles in China and abroad in recent days, such as a friend of China, an old man in Shanghai, etc., which is enough to show that Mr. Ke is loved by the general public. Mr. Ann Zhude expressed his reluctance while saying goodbye to him on behalf of the Bureau of Works, but wished Mr. Ke a long life and eternal happiness after retiring. Cunningham then stood up to thank him. In addition to his modesty, Mr. Ke also recounted the past changes in Shanghai, the complex social situation today, the importance of the tasks of the Chinese and foreign directors, and the spirit of sacrifice of those who serve the society. Mr. Ke repeatedly mentioned the need for cooperation in his speech. Mr. Ke said that Shanghai is composed of the public concession, the common public concession and the French concession. Therefore, the greatness and prosperity of Shanghai in the future lies in the cooperation, mutual respect, mutual understanding, and mutual assistance between Chinese and foreign people, and in understanding each other's views anytime and anywhere.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Director General J. D. Clark Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Letter to Gande Yun Contesting Voting Rights in the Special District</h3>
<p>Promote the Revision of the Yangjingbang Regulations and Urge the Government to Negotiate the Revision</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Lawyer Gande Yun refused to pay the Public Works Department's house tax because Chinese taxpayers could not enjoy the same voting rights as Western taxpayers, and sent letters to various groups requesting assistance. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied yesterday, stating that it was willing to take the revision of the Yangjingbang Regulations as a key measure. The following are the two letters:</p>
<p>Gande Yun's Letter</p>
<p>Greetings. In recent years, the country has been beset by difficulties, with internal and external troubles pressing on our brows. The late Qing Dynasty was not familiar with diplomacy, and the national power gradually weakened. The establishment of concessions in various treaty ports was due to the signing of unequal treaties. All management rights, taxation situations, and all administrations within the concessions held by various countries in our country are also attributed to illegal donations in the concessions. Moreover, the will of the late Premier also contains a passage about uniting weak nations to fight for freedom and equality. This time, Deyun legally refused to pay the Public Works Department's house tax, which led to litigation. Deyun's ten major reasons for defense have been published in various newspapers on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of this month. I believe you have already read them. Judging from the nature of the house tax, the bureau is neither a legal organization nor has it obtained the permission of our government. How can it collect taxes arbitrarily? However, since it collects taxes, the Chinese taxpayers account for 75%, and the Westerners account for 25%. A small number of Westerners can enjoy the right to vote at the taxpayers' annual meeting, while the majority of Chinese cannot fully obtain the right to vote. Although Chinese occupy five seats on the board of directors, the number of Chinese directors should be more than five based on the number of taxpayers. This is enough to prove that it is an unfair sign, which means inequality. Judging from this kind of fact, the relationship is very small for Deyun personally, but it is very important for the whole. For the sake of our country's position and the rights of residents, I hope that you will give strong support to strive for equality. The Chinese people are very fortunate. Deyun can't help but look forward to it. Special announcement of my humble thoughts.</p>
<p>Letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Mr. Deyun, greetings. I have received your letter. We admire Mr. Deyun's fearless spirit in fighting for elections and resisting by stopping the payment of taxes. From the perspective of the fundamental solution to the case, belonging to a foreign nationality means obtaining the right to vote at the taxpayers' annual meeting, while restoring Chinese nationality means not having this right, which is very unfair. However, what they are based on is the Yangjingbang Concession Regulations. These regulations have not been approved by the government. According to the recent situation, such as expanding the number of directors and adding Chinese, there have been many changes compared to the original regulations. Therefore, the London Times also advocated revising the Yangjingbang Concession Regulations to adapt to the environment. In our opinion, striving for the right to vote at the taxpayers' annual meeting should start from revising the Yangjingbang Concession Regulations. It is appropriate to awaken public opinion, urge the government, and start negotiations, which is a key measure. I dare to contribute my humble opinion to your request for assistance. Special reply, and congratulations on your well-being.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Mobilizes Opium Smokers for Final Inspection Yesterday</h3>
<p>Those Who Voluntarily Close Opium Dens Before the End of the Month Can Avoid Punishment</p>
<p>The final inspection of opium smokers in the city, the water patrol team of the Public Security Bureau, and the police officers of various branches were fully mobilized yesterday morning to inspect opium smokers hiding in their respective jurisdictions and secretly opened opium dens. They must eliminate the opium atmosphere in the city within the half-month general inspection period, which will end at the end of the month. However, before the inspection is held, opium offenders who know repentance and go to the bureau to surrender will be exempted from punishment. As for those who illegally open opium dens, they should be severely punished if they "do not know repentance." However, in order to give special consideration to the ignorant people outside the law, those who voluntarily stop opening opium dens will also be given leniency, it is said.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Railway Transportation Department on Careful Driving Schedule</h3>
<p>The Director Decided to Send Everyone Out to Implement Concrete Instructions Within Ten Days</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Transportation Department issued a notice to the relevant officials yesterday, stating that the new train schedule of the railway has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways for approval. It is now stipulated that it will be implemented from December 21. The Transportation Department should issue it and promptly handle all preparations such as publishing the announcement in the newspaper. Within ten days after the new train schedule is implemented, the Machinery Department, the Engineering Department, the Transportation Department, and the Police Department should also send senior officials to accompany the train for inspection (the heads of each section should participate in the responsible section) to give practical instructions to the train staff. When stopping at the station, the Transportation Department and the Police Department should work together to pay close attention to how to maintain order and疏通crowding to avoid affecting the punctuality of the train. In addition to separate orders, they should comply. In addition to the new train schedule, which will be announced and implemented by the department, within ten days after the new schedule is implemented, the director and deputy director of the department, together with the chief of the Transportation Section stationed in the department, the director of the Dispatching Section of the Transportation Division, the dispatchers, and the director of the Driving Section, will, together with the chiefs and deputy chiefs of the Transportation Section of each responsible section, and the driving affairs staff, take turns to inspect the train to give practical instructions to the train staff. The stationmasters of each station and the ticket inspectors should also pay close attention to maintaining order when passengers get on and off the train,疏通crowding, so as to affect the punctuality of the train. This notice is hereby issued for compliance.</p>

<h3>Flood Relief Association to Hold Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition to Help Disaster Relief Convention</h3>
<p>Opening at the People's Education Center on the 27th, Reception for Leaders from All Walks of Life Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Mr. Li Dachao, Deputy Director of the Fundraising Group of the Flood Relief Association of Various Provinces in this city, and Wang Lanjun of the Xiangyi Calligraphy and Painting Society, who has traveled all over the country, plan to hold a calligraphy and painting exhibition for two days during the New Year's holiday. The exhibition site has been decided to be at the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi, and it is scheduled to open on the 27th of this month. The exhibition period is currently set for three days. If necessary, the exhibition period may be extended, it is not yet known. Because Xiangzu is a calligraphy group that has traveled all over the country for a long time, all the works of famous calligraphers and painters from various provinces have been collected, and they are rich in the meaning of national revival. Therefore, this calligraphy and painting exhibition contains special intentions. The founder of the society, Wang Lanjun, in view of the severe disaster situation this year, did not dare to lag behind in relief funds, and donated more than 500 pieces of famous calligraphy collected over the years to the Flood Relief Association. The funds from the sale will be used to relieve the victims and save the people. It is reported that the association is seeking opinions from all parties in order to increase efficiency, and will hold a reception for leaders from all walks of life at 12 o'clock noon tomorrow (18th) on the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, and will display many works of the society for criticism from all walks of life. It is heard that the letter of invitation has been sent out.</p>
<h3>38th Office Meeting of the Shanghai Solicitation Team Headquarters of the Aviation Association</h3>
<p>At 2:00 PM on the 10th, the office of the Shanghai Solicitation Team Headquarters of the China Aviation Association held the 38th office meeting at the office of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to discuss matters related to solicitation and fundraising. Those present included General Secretary Li Dachao, Secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Zhou Songhe, Lu Zhangyan, Li Huiran, Chen Shuo, Huang Jun, Gu Shangrui, Zhang Xiamin, Wei Daxin, Song Zheng, Zhu Shengyang, Li Jiming, Yang Peiwen, and Liu Songtao. Li Dachao chaired the meeting, and Chen Shuo recorded the minutes. The chairman reported that the solicitation teams have been working very hard in soliciting donations. The office had previously issued letters to end the solicitation in stages. Recently, the results have been very enthusiastic. However, some solicitation teams are still actively engaged in activities. The field secretaries should work hard to assist and issue another letter to step up the process, report and submit the results, and end the solicitation by the end of this month. Since the public solicitation of members has been carried out, not only the compatriots and groups in the city have joined one after another, but also people from provinces, cities, and counties have sent letters to join. The solicitation should continue to be carried out. All provinces, cities, groups, and individuals in the city can be solicited separately, and the promotion should be carried out step by step to make it popular. This can not only increase the results, but also increase the strength of the campaign. As for the hotel industry's collection of aviation patriotic donations, the results in November were better than the previous month, which shows that the hotels are enthusiastic and patriotic, and support the general public's micro-solicitation. Because of the organizational relationship of the transportation trucks, the collection of aviation donations for brick and ash transportation has been decided to change the method, and directly collect from the brick and ash industry. The progress is smooth. After the start of the collection of donations from the private shipping industry, the results have been excellent. On the 12th, a meeting was convened with the relevant groups, and the Municipal Party Department was invited to send personnel to attend and guide the meeting to discuss the progress. Detailed measures have been formulated. The aviation donations from the dance halls will be collected by the dance halls when opening the bills, and will start within a few days. In addition, in order to connect the feelings of the members and make the members understand the status of the association's affairs and assist the association's affairs, the association plans to hold member communications to report the progress of aviation patriotism and the association's affairs, etc. Then, the field secretaries reported on the liaison with the teams and the investigation of the donation collection of the various industries. After discussing many cases of solicitation and fundraising, the meeting adjourned at 4:40. In addition, the aviation patriotic exhibition in the Hongxi area was held at the Caojiadu Era Middle School, and it opened at 10:00 AM yesterday. Although it was raining, the visitors were very crowded. It is heard that the exhibition period is set for half a month.</p>

<p>Because of the old debt issue, all directors and supervisors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company resigned, and their attitude was negative.

<h3>Strange Homicide in Vacant House: Deceased Was a Seven- or Eight-Year-Old Girl Hanging Herself; No Stool Present, How Could She Hang So High Is a Question</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a strange homicide was discovered on the third floor of a house at No. 685 Baoshan Road, Zhabei. The deceased was a child who hanged herself there, which is quite suspicious. The results of the investigation are recorded below. The house where the incident occurred belongs to a three-story shop facing Baoshan Road and five interconnected houses, all of which are vacant and uninhabited. The night before last, neighbors nearby suddenly heard frequent noises from inside the house, which was quite surprising. They notified the watchman Zhou Jinrong, who manages the house, to open the door and check for any anomalies. When he stepped onto the third floor, he saw a girl hanging herself from a rope tied to the horse eye on the ceiling board. Zhou was greatly frightened upon seeing this and ran to inform the neighbors. For a while, the threshold was worn through by those who went to see. Zhou then reported the incident to the police station in charge, who immediately ordered the local headman Yan Liugen to report to the local court to request an autopsy. At 2:00 PM, Prosecutor Zhang Zi, commissioned by the court, arrived at the scene with Examiner Shen. It was found that the girl was about seven or eight years old, wearing a floral cloth short shirt, lined with a floral cloth cotton-padded jacket, a white-bottomed red-striped flannel shirt, wearing dark blue cotton pants, horizontally striped money socks, and dark cloth shoes. There were no other injuries on her body, and it was determined that she had hanged herself. However, her abdomen had already changed color, indicating that she had been dead for several days. The strangest thing is that the horse eye is above the ceiling board. Even if an adult hanged himself, he would need to stand on a stool. How could this seven- or eight-year-old child hang so high without a stool? It is a real question. Moreover, no family members have come forward to identify her. After the judge finished the autopsy, he ordered the local headman to report to the court to provide a coffin for burial. The hanging rope (which was a very thin blue cloth strip) was ordered to be taken back to the court for safekeeping. At the same time, the watchman Zhou Jinrong was ordered to come to the court for questioning at 10:00 AM tomorrow (today).</p>
<h3>Police Officer's Gun Robbed</h3>
<p>Hua Bu No. 1913 of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, at about 5:00 PM yesterday, while patrolling the intersection of Tongzhou Road and Haller Road, suddenly three men jumped out from the roadside, pulled out a pistol, and held him down. The officer was caught off guard at the time, so the pistol he was wearing was robbed by the three bandits and they escaped without a trace. The officer was unable to catch up and hurried back to the police station to report and search everywhere.</p>
<h3>Sixth Group Wedding – Registration Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Limited to One Hundred Couples, First Come, First Served</p>
<p>This city's group weddings have been held five times, with over four hundred participating couples. It is now known that the sixth group wedding ceremony will be held on February 5th of next year. Since the Social Bureau announced the start of registration on the 9th of this month, many people have been going to the city center to apply. It is reported that those who have completed the procedures include dozens of couples such as Ni Yongxing and Zhou Huiying from International Radio Station, Li Jingqing and Zhong Xiu from the Bank of China, Gu Peide and Gu Jingzhen from Tongji University, Yang Xuyan and Zheng Zhiyi from Zhonghui Bank, Li Yaoting and Chen Shuhui from Zhonghui Bank, Zai Zhongheng and Zhou Yuying from Yingfeng Hengjin Company, Sun Yinian and Li Shuxian from the Finance Bureau, Zheng Bingwen and Zhang Wenxiang from Shanghai Bank, Zhang Zhiyuan and Fu Zhen'e from Anli Foreign Firm, Feng Ciliang and Zhao Zhuangnian from the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol, Yu Zonghan and Zhang Yixin from Xinlu Normal School, Chen Qin from International Radio Station and Jin Lu from Shanghai Telephone Bureau. Therefore, it has been decided to limit the number of participants to one hundred couples. Many applicants, fearing that they will be left out due to incomplete procedures or reaching the quota, have requested to reserve places. In order to ensure equal opportunities for participants, the Social Bureau will base the order on the date of arrival of the application documents. Registration for this session will close at the end of December. Those who wish to participate can attach a stamp and write to the Public Welfare Section of the Bureau for detailed instructions and application forms.</p>
<h3>Low Pressure System Hits Shanghai, City Drizzled Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Lawsuit Filed Over Damaged Creditor Rights After Ding Sheng Bank Closed</h3>
<p>Lawyers and Shareholders Accused of Collusion and Malpractice</p>
<p>After Ding Sheng Bank closed, the bank's shareholders and managers hired lawyers Zhang Ji and Xie Tangyan as liquidators. Although the bank owed more than one million in debts, its assets were also substantial, so settling the debts was not very difficult. Over the past few months, most creditors have accepted the terms of discounted repayment and settled their accounts. However, some depositors, such as Qi Wuyin, Song Zhichu, and Luo Yongfa, were unwilling to accept the sacrifice and have not yet settled. Recently, these depositors discovered that the two lawyers, Zhang Ji and Xie Tangyan, along with Yang Songnian, a shareholder and supervisor of Ding Sheng, and Xie Qianshou, the manager of Ding Sheng, were involved in collusion and malpractice, depositing the received money into other banks, causing creditors to suffer greater losses. Therefore, they hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against Zhang Ji, Xie Tangyan, Yang Songnian, and Xie Qianshou for damaging creditor rights, requesting that they be punished according to law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao opened the court and ordered the four defendants to appear in court for interrogation. After the plaintiff's attorney presented the indictment, Judge Ye briefly questioned the defendants. Considering the details of the case to be important and requiring thorough investigation, he adjourned the court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Chen Shiyi Owes Rent, Bad Check Issued</h3>
<p>Check Signed by Movie Star Xu Lai, Chen and Xu Both Accused of Fraud</p>
<p>Xu Lai, a female actress of Mingxing Film Company, and Chen Shiyi, residing at No. 36, Lane 641, Yuyuan Road, were recently accused by Gao Pengrong, the head waiter of New Shanghai Hotel on Nanjing Road, of colluding in fraud and issuing bad checks. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai presided over the hearing in the Ninth Criminal Court. Neither defendant, Chen Shiyi nor Xu Lai, appeared in court. According to the bailiff's report, the residence at No. 36, Lane 641, Yuyuan Road, is occupied by a Mr. Li, and there are no persons named Chen and Xu, so the summons could not be delivered and was returned. Subsequently, the plaintiff Gao Pengrong stated that he works as a head waiter at the New Shanghai Hotel and is friends with Chen Shiyi. On October 18th of this year, Chen checked into room 140 and owed a total of 21 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen in rent for ten days until the 28th. At that time, because Chen acted extravagantly, the tea servers and bookkeepers were deceived into lending him 78 yuan and 9 jiao, totaling 100 yuan, 0 jiao, and 1 fen. Later, seeing that Chen's behavior was suspicious, he stopped lending and demanded the owed money. At that time, a friend of Chen, Mr. Huang, wearing a suit, came to intercede and handed me a 100-yuan check from Zhongfu Bank issued by Xu Lai as settlement. I asked if the check was reliable. Huang replied that Xu Lai is a movie star and would not break his promise for such a small amount. To be cautious, I called the Li residence on Yuyuan Road, who confirmed that Xu Lai had indeed issued the check, so I believed it to be true. Unexpectedly, when it was due, the check bounced at Zhongfu Bank, and Chen Shiyi disappeared. According to this situation, Chen Shiyi and Xu Lai have colluded in fraud and issued bad checks, which constitutes a crime under Article 339 of the Criminal Code and Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law. He also filed a private prosecution, requesting full compensation. Judge Dai, since both defendants were absent, adjourned the case for seven days and ordered the plaintiff to ensure the defendants are summoned to court for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society Requests Police Department to Formulate Anti-Theft Measures</h3>
<p>The methods of thieves in this city are extremely vicious. The theft of rickshaws still occurs. The Mutual Aid Society is deeply aware of this. At the same time, at the request of its members, it has repeatedly consulted with the authorities of the Public Concession Public Works Bureau Police Department to seek practical relief measures. It is now learned that the Police Department has issued a special notice stating: "To warn rickshaw pullers, it has been found that rickshaw thefts have occurred frequently recently. The method of theft is to call the rickshaw puller into an alley to collect the fare. After obtaining the fare, when exiting the alley, the rickshaw has been stolen. This method is mostly carried out by passengers colluding with thieves. Sometimes, two passengers hire two rickshaws at the same time. One of the rickshaw pullers is in collusion with the passengers. When they reach their destination, the rickshaw puller in collusion calls the other rickshaw puller into the alley to collect the fare, and the other rickshaw puller (the one in collusion with the thieves) agrees to watch the rickshaw. When that rickshaw puller gets the fare and exits the alley, the rickshaw is stolen by thieves lying in ambush nearby. In view of the above situation, this office issues the following warning to rickshaw pullers: never leave your rickshaw unattended. If passengers call the rickshaw puller into an alley to collect the fare, the rickshaw should be pulled into the alley at the same time. If the alley entrance is narrow and inconvenient to pull in, and the passengers refuse to pay on the roadside, the rickshaw puller may ask for assistance. All rickshaw pullers must pay attention. This announcement is not only posted by the Mutual Aid Society in its various offices, but also distributed to various rickshaw companies for posting. It is hoped that all rickshaw pullers in the city will pay attention to this so that thieves have no means to carry out their tricks."</p>

Yesterday, the Federation received a reply from the Ministry of Health (Medical Letter No. 2278) stating: "We have received your submission and believe that your reasons are not without merit. The proposed amendment to Article 9 of the Regulations for the Administration of Proprietary Medicines is feasible and should be reserved for reference. However, external liquid medicines are easily confused with internal liquid medicines and should still use blue containers. As for other external proprietary medicines, for the time being, you are permitted to apply for inspection and certification for sales using the original colors of the medicines. You are hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Improved Practical Examples of Chinese Bookkeeping Published</h3>
<p>—Written by Accountant Xu Yongzuo—</p>
<p>The current bookkeeping methods in our country are roughly divided into two schools: Chinese and Western. Western bookkeeping is horizontal, and the registration paper and ink are imported. The account management and accounting methods are all rigid and adhere to Western practices. Not only is it difficult to imitate, but also the cost is huge. Chinese bookkeeping is vertical, and the paper and ink are all domestic products. The account management and accounting methods are familiar to Chinese people. However, the system is imperfect, and the arrangement is without order, which violates the original purpose of accounting. Therefore, it is often criticized. Accountant Xu Yongzuo has been serving the society for many years. He is saddened by the shortcomings of the current bookkeeping system. He once launched a movement to improve Chinese bookkeeping. He has lectured at various universities and written articles in various magazines, advocating the improvement of Chinese bookkeeping using the most economical and effective methods based on our country's inherent system and adopting the world's latest theories. Since the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, he formulated an improvement plan and compiled a general overview of improved Chinese bookkeeping. In the winter of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, he revised the plan and supplemented the general overview. He once received the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to hold exhibitions and lectures. Now, in order to promote the implementation of improved Chinese bookkeeping, he has compiled and printed a book of practical examples of improved Chinese bookkeeping and a collection of papers on improved Chinese bookkeeping. The practical examples focus on the practice of specific account formats, and the collection of papers focuses on the exploration of bookkeeping theories, which complement the previously compiled general overview of improved Chinese bookkeeping. The place of publication is Xu Accountant's Office, No. 312 Edward Road.</p>

<h3>Silk and Satin Industry Association Encourages Abolition of Old System Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, because the silk and satin industry is still using the old system of weights and measures, has instructed the industry association to quickly confiscate and destroy them. After receiving the order, the association first went to various retail silk and satin shops and wholesale stores in the Public Concession yesterday to confiscate the old instruments. It is reported that more than ten stores, including Jiufeng, refused to comply. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the association has once again solemnly explained and persuaded various non-compliant stores, for the sake of maintaining relationships within the industry, in order to maintain consistent policies, eliminate malpractices, and reform, improve, and facilitate the use of weights and measures for merchants and the public. After confiscating the old instruments from various silk stores in the Public Concession, they will then go to stores in Xiaodongmen to confiscate the old instruments. If the stores are stubborn and uncooperative after persuasion, they are suspected of disrupting government policies. After a detailed investigation, the names of the non-compliant households will be registered and reported to the Social Bureau, which will directly send personnel to confiscate the instruments and impose severe penalties as a warning. It is also heard that some silk and satin cotton cloth stores in this city are still using the old system of instruments.</p>

<h3>Zhuang Tongsheng Leather Shop Deceived</h3>
<p>The Offender Has Been Sent to the Bureau for Handling According to Law</p>
<p>Zhuang Tongsheng Leather Shop, No. 6 Sanpailou, is a century-old shop. Its owner, Zhuang Chengwu, met Shi Zhonglin (a 56-year-old Ningbo native), a clerk at the Minsheng Paper Mill, while visiting a friend at the mill. However, Shi was a slippery swindler who took advantage of the opportunity to visit Zhuang Tongsheng on September 8th and 12th of this year by black-plated car, falsely claiming that his relatives wanted to buy a large quantity of fine fur goods and were afraid of being fooled, so they must first see the samples before deciding. Zhuang, being familiar with him, took out fur goods worth 174 yuan one after another. Who knew that Shi never returned? Zhuang sent a shop assistant to the factory to inquire. On October 3rd, Shi returned to Zhuang Tongsheng and claimed that a part of the fur goods had been selected and immediately signed a 58-yuan check from the Siming Savings Bank dated October 6th. When it was due, it could not be cashed. Shi then said that the money had not been remitted yet and would be available on November 7th. Unexpectedly, when the date arrived, it still could not be cashed. Then it was learned that Shi had been dismissed by the factory. Knowing that he had been deceived, he conducted various investigations and learned that Shi Zhonglin was hiding at No. 16 Guangxingli, Wuchang Road.

<h3>Arrested for Smoking Opium Without a License</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of opium smoker registration in this city, it has been quite effective.

<h3>Continued Trial of Lu Wenying, Accused of Running Illegal Gambling and Instigating Murder</h3>
<p>Lu Jianwu Believes All Police Stations Still Need to Investigate</p>
<p>Lu Wenying, a local woman, also known as Laoqi, was involved in the case of Shaw Wenbin, who was assassinated on the night of July 28, 1932, due to running an illegal gambling syndicate, on suspicion of instigating the murder. She was arrested by the French Concession Police and the Laoza Police Station of the Public Concession at No. 9 Yu _ Li, Yunnan Road, at 9:00 p.m. on the 9th of the month. She was taken back to the police station and sent to the Special Court for interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date of the trial. At around 10:00 a.m., Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court, accompanied by Recorder Gao Yanmao, arrived at the Criminal Court to interrogate her. The defense lawyers hired by the defendant, Jiang Yiping, _ Mousheng, and Ma _ Hua, arrived on time to await instructions. After the court opened, the official ordered the defendant to be brought to the case. According to Gu Shouxi, the lawyer representing the Police Department, the case is still adjourned. The Police Department has clarified and has evidence of the defendant's involvement in the gambling case. As for the murder case, many perpetrators were confessed before, and the execution of the prisoners is now required to interrogate the defendant who always denied it. However, in the confession of the prisoner Zhang Bingrong, Cao Awu and others discussed the matter, and the defendant was also present. The Police Department has not yet completed the investigation procedures and requests another adjournment for 1 day or 5 or 6 days for another trial. The court verified the statement and asked the defendant Lu Wenying, "Did you hear what the lawyer of the Police Department said? He said that you have already admitted to the gambling case, and the murder case still needs to be investigated." Lu replied, "In March of the 22nd year [1933], when I opened a salted meat shop on Edward Road, a guest named Xiao Pengtou came to me and said that he was doing gambling listening in the Chinese territory and invited me to contribute foreign yuan as a share, but I did not. More than a month later, at the end of April, Xiao Pengtou gave me 20 foreign yuan, saying it was money from the listening. Later, it was discovered by the detective, who came to my shop (ie brothel) to search, but no evidence was found. After that, I transferred the salted meat shop to someone else. I have never done gambling listening. As for Mao Axiang, I knew his wife when I was 19 years old, so I knew Mao. I don't know anyone else." The official asked, "In the gambling, what is a big listening, what is a small listening?" Lu replied, "Anyone can do a small listening. A big listening must be opened by someone with face. I am a woman, how can I do a big listening?" She also stated, "Shao Wenbin was my neighbor. I called him grandfather. He invited me to dinner during festivals. Shao's wife had passed away, and Chen Lao Er was married in a brothel and lived in Zhilanfang. I called Lao _ Aunt. On June _, [i.e. July 28], Shao was killed. Shao's wife, Chen Lao, was crying on the road. I lived by the road and heard the sound. Lao _ told me that Shao Wenbin was killed. I went with her to Tongren Fu _ Tang. When the detective came to investigate, Lao _ denied that Shao was her husband and said that he was a tenant. I stopped her, and she admitted that Shao was her husband. I didn't sleep that night and gave the gold chain to the dead man, Zhi Chang Cheng _. The next day, I also went to the funeral wearing white clothes. Now Lao _ is married again. This year, I also made Zhou Nian with Shao. Why would I want to murder him?" At this point, the court adjourned the hearing to the 20th. The defendant was still remanded in custody. She also stated to the court, "Since I was arrested, I have not eaten a single grain of rice. Although the police station has arranged for me to stay in a separate room, people come to see me at night from time to time, causing me to be frightened and unable to sleep, which has greatly affected my health. Please allow me to be transferred to the detention center." The lawyer for the Police Department opposed the defendant's request because the Police Department still needs to investigate the defendant. The official ruled that the defendant was allowed to be transferred to the detention center and suspended visits. If the Police Department wants to investigate, they can take the defendant away for questioning at any time. After the order was completed, the defendant was taken back to custody by the bailiff.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhixian's Car Accident: Appeal Against Original Verdict</h3>
<p>Damaging Liu Weichi's Car and Injuring Peng Chunshi's Leg</p>
<p>Chen Zhixian, a 33-year-old Zhejiang Cixi native and radio engineer residing at 15, Lane 109, Hart Road, is responsible for the installation and repair of most radio stations in the city. In May of this year, he purchased a car from the United Motor Company. On the evening of the 18th of that month, while driving on Avenue Foch, around 11 p.m., he drove at full speed eastward and struck legislator Peng Chunshi's leg, also damaging the Ye Qianban of the car belonging to former Minister of Industry, Liu Weichi. The police took him to the station, where the traffic violation was settled with a fine. Chen was responsible for repairing Minister Liu's car. However, Peng Chunshi's leg was injured and treated at various hospitals in Shanghai, Nanjing Central Hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, etc., but it did not recover. Peng appointed lawyer Hu Jue and others to file a private prosecution against Chen Zhixian for negligent injury in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, along with a civil suit seeking 2,000 yuan for medical and damage expenses. After repeated court hearings, Chen Zhixian was found guilty of negligent injury, sentenced to two months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve, and ordered to pay 850 yuan in damages. Chen, dissatisfied with the initial civil and criminal judgments, appealed to the collegiate bench of the Special No. 2 Court. His reason was that the car was driven by chauffeur Xu Awu that night, and he himself was sitting next to Xu, watching him drive, and should not be held responsible. The case was repeatedly heard by Judge Xiong Ping. Witnesses such as Liu Weichi and legislator Zhang Guoyuan, who had provided written testimonies in the original trial, did not appear in court. Only the appellant Chen Zhixian, chauffeur Xu Awu, and Xu Houyu's chauffeur Yan Awei appeared for questioning. The Chinese constable No. 333 from the French Concession police station was also summoned for questioning. Yesterday, the court held another hearing. Zhang Jinkui, Liu Weichi's chauffeur, testified that he only saw one car driving from east to west that night. His car was parked at No. 419 Avenue Foch and was hit by the car. At the time, he was only concerned about his own damaged car and saw someone knocked down. He did not clearly see who was hit or who was driving the car that caused the accident. He only saw someone resembling the car owner get out of the car and want to leave. He told him that his car had been damaged and asked him to go to the police station. The person agreed to pay compensation. When asked if the person who got out of the car was this person (pointing to the appellant Chen Zhixian), Zhang looked at Chen's face and answered, "Yes, it is." He could not remember anything else because it had been a long time. The judge asked Chen Zhixian what his opinion was of the witness's testimony. Chen replied that the gist of the witness's testimony was correct, but the person seen at the scene was the concierge constable of No. 333, not the uniformed patrolman from the police station. The court ordered a postponement to summon the concierge constable of No. 333 to court for verification and then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Wu Chengyu Accused of False Accusation</h3>
<p>Court Hearing Concluded Yesterday; Judgment Scheduled for Next Monday</p>
<p>Wu Chengyu, a Cantonese who formerly practiced law, represented a woman named Fan Wu in 1932, accusing her paramour Fan Zhaolan and his wife Fan Zhang of jointly committing crimes of injury, obstructing family, fraudulent seduction, and attempted murder in the First Special District Court. After trial by the First Special District Court, Fan Zhaolan and Fan Zhang were each fined 20 yuan for joint injury, while the remaining charges were dismissed. Fan Wu, dissatisfied with the verdict, retained lawyer Wu to file appeals in the second and third instances, which ultimately upheld the original verdict of the First Special District Court. The First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, suspecting Fan Wu and Wu Chengyu of making false accusations, investigated the matter.</p>
<p>A public prosecution was initiated in the Criminal Division of the same court. The case against Fan Wu has already been concluded, with a sentence of six months' imprisonment and a three-year reprieve. The trial of Wu Chengyu, whose whereabouts were unknown, was suspended. Now that Wu has returned to Shanghai and resides at No. 1342 North Sichuan Road, where he is engaged in mining, the First Special District Court, noting Wu's return, proceeded with the case. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Wu was summoned to the First Criminal Court, presided over by Criminal Division Chief Qian Hongye and Prosecutor Pei You. Prosecutor Tang first presented the indictment, stating that Fan Wu had accused Fan Zhaolan, Fan Zhang, etc. of murder, fraud,</p>
<p>Seduction, and Injury. The court found the defendants guilty of injury and fined them 20 yuan, while the remaining charges were dismissed. The prosecutor argued that a false accusation was made and requested judgment in accordance with Article 169, Section 1, and Article 30 of the Criminal Code against Wu Chengyu and Fan Wu. Wu Chengyu testified that he did not know Fan Wu before she was brought to him by her father, Wu Xiquan, who entrusted him to represent her in the accusations against</p>
<p>Fan Zhaolan and others. Based on her account, she claimed that she was seduced by Fan Zhaolan, and after giving birth to a child, Fan Zhang killed the child with corrosive liquid and frequently abused her. Therefore, he filed the lawsuit on her behalf. The court immediately inquired whether he had reported the matter to the police before filing the private prosecution. He answered, "Yes." The court pointed out that the police record only mentioned abuse and did not mention murder or seduction. He replied that it was because a long time had passed. The court asked if Fan Wu and Fan Zhaolan were together in 1930, when she was 21 years old, then she should be 23 years old at the time of the lawsuit. Why was she still described as 21 years old? He answered that Fan Wu claimed to be 21 years old, and he did not know</p>
<p>Exactly how old she was. The court asked why she was described as 23 years old in the appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court and 25 years old in the appeal to the Supreme Court. He answered that the clerk wrote this according to the judgment of the first instance, and he was negligent and did not pay attention to it or correct it. The court asked that Fan Wu’s testimonies in the original trial regarding the infanticide case did not correspond in four instances, that the original trial declared innocence, and yet he continued to appeal repeatedly. The answer was that Fan Wu did not believe that the nanny was summoned for investigation, and that investigations were not fully made, so she had to appeal. The court asked Wu for further cross examination, and ordered Prosecutor Tang to debate the case, considering that Fan Yu had already</p>
<p>Started the debate, the question was regarding Wu's claims that Fan Wu had already turned 20 years old and he claimed that she was not yet 20 years old, and that Fan Wu’s son died of illness, and was described as premeditated, and the relationships of Fan Wu and Fan Zhaolan, and the relationship of mistress and concubine, show that there was no obligation to support, and that the accusations of abandonment and seduction were clearly aiding false accusations, that a legal sentence should be requested. The lawyer for Wu defended his client, claiming that Wu only drafted the accusation based on the intention of a normal person, and even if it was a false accusation, the client should be held responsible, and that the defendant should not bear responsibility and should be declared not guilty. Judge Qian then concluded the debate and set the sentencing for next Monday morning. Wu was ordered to pay a guarantee of 300 yuan, or a guarantee letter, and until a guarantor was found, was ordered to be released under the responsibility of his defense attorney, lawyer Gan.</p>
<h3>British Air Attaché, Wilcock, Arrives in Shanghai for Inspection</h3>

<h3>Special District Rickshaw Businessmen Petition the Taxpayers' Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding Negotiations with the Municipal Council for the Return of Impounded Vehicles, etc.</p>
<p>Special District rickshaw businessmen, due to the frequent unwarranted impounding and fines of their vehicles, and based on a resolution of the members' assembly, led by Shan Baozhen, Huang Muyiao, and others, yesterday afternoon, more than sixty fined rickshaw businessmen petitioned the Chinese Taxpayers' Association. They also planned to petition the municipal government in the coming days. Their demands are: 1. Return of impounded vehicles; 2. Cancellation of fines. Their petition stated: "To the esteemed association, we humbly submit this petition. Since the establishment of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee by the Municipal Council last year, the implementation of new regulations has become increasingly severe, with excessive demands and unreasonable actions at every turn. Leaving past grievances aside, the recent wrongful collection of vehicle rental fees, resulting in fines and license impoundment for over one hundred households, continues unabated. Such arbitrary and unreasonable actions, regardless of truth, are unbearable for rickshaw businessmen. This is one grievance. Furthermore, operating vehicles requires rickshaw pullers. Due to an insufficient number of registered rickshaw pullers, we requested the Rickshaw Committee to supplement the registration, but this has been ignored. Any inspection of rickshaw puller armbands will inevitably lead to vehicle impoundment, making it impossible to do business. This is another grievance. The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association is not under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council, yet license donations must be paid to the association, otherwise, licenses will not be issued. This is incomprehensible. According to a letter from the Rickshaw Pullers' Association, the Rickshaw Committee is mishandling the Mutual Aid Association and further fees have been unilaterally halted. According to a letter from all lessees, they refuse to collect Mutual Aid Association fees on behalf. On this basis, if one party does not recognize it and the other party refuses to collect it, rickshaw businessmen will inevitably suffer further losses, which they cannot bear. This is another grievance. Other issues, such as forcing lessees to sign for rickshaw puller debts and threatening to impound licenses for one or two months for violating regulations to force payment of fines (receipts and fine photos attached), are examples of illegal coercion. Our trade association convened a general assembly of all rickshaw owners in the Special District on the 2nd of this month to discuss the above cases. As a result, representatives were appointed to negotiate with the Rickshaw Committee several times, but to no avail. Rickshaw businessmen are on the verge of bankruptcy and are determined to achieve improvement. In desperation, we hereby jointly petition your esteemed association to consider the various pains of oppression and destruction suffered by taxpayers, uphold justice, and negotiate with the Municipal Council to quickly improve policies and dissolve the Rickshaw Committee, so that the rickshaw industry does not go bankrupt. This would be most fortunate."</p>
<h3>Taifeng Company Expected to Resume Business</h3>
<p>Opening Scheduled for January 9th</p>
<p>Taifeng Canned Food Company, a pioneer in canned food production in China with a capital of 300,000 yuan, had been in operation for 29 years until its closure last year. A review of its annual operations shows that it had been profitable every year. Unfortunately, due to former manager Wang Baru investing 380,000 yuan in cash in the Minghua Match Company, its financial turnover was disrupted. For the past year, efforts have been made to resume operations, and recently, progress has been made. The renovation of the Nanjing Road headquarters store has begun, with the expectation that it will be able to open for business on January 9th of next year. According to Mr. Shen Linsheng of the company's business resumption preparation office, since the company announced the preparations for resuming business and adding new shares, many people have come to request the articles of association or subscribe to shares. The original capital stock of 300,000 yuan (3,000 shares at 100 yuan per share) has been agreed upon by the old shareholders to be converted at a rate of three shares for one share, totaling 1,000 shares. In addition, it is planned to raise 200,000 yuan in preferred stock (20,000 shares at 10 yuan per share), for a total of 300,000 yuan in national currency, to comply with the original registration. The company has had profits every year, with sales reaching over 600,000 yuan in the last year of operation. The existing assets are still worth over 500,000 yuan, and the company's long history and brand name are well-known, which is a guarantee of safety. Currently, more than half of the preferred stock has been raised, and the entire amount should be no problem. Therefore, renovations have begun, with the aim of resuming business on January 9th of next year. More than 200 original workers were paid wages during the shutdown period, so work can begin as soon as the funds are collected. However, it may be necessary to reduce the scope of operations.</p>
<h3>Yili Company to Resume Operations Soon</h3>
<p>Liquidation Stopped; Business Resumption Committee Formed</p>
<p>Yili General Company, founded by Xu Tingzuo, along with Yili Soda, Hardware, and Shipping Companies, and Zhenli Bank, etc., were unable to maintain operations due to market influences. Lawyer He Baiqian and accountant Jiang Xinzhao were entrusted to handle the liquidation, which has been ongoing for three months. Although internal reorganization has been completed, assets are in the hands of mortgagees, making it impossible to sell them. Recovering customer debts has also been difficult, making it insufficient to pay outstanding employee salaries and liquidation expenses. Fortunately, major creditors have been understanding to ensure the future benefits of both parties, and leaders in the business community are willing to assist. Therefore, a partial business resumption plan for the Yili Soda Factory will be realized in the coming days. Because liquidation is no longer necessary, Mr. Xu and others have specially requested the liquidation agents to withdraw the entire liquidation business and handle it themselves, and the agency liquidation commission has been revoked. A business resumption committee has been formed to actively carry out the resumption, scheduled to be implemented after the Spring Festival, in order to maintain the domestic soda business. After the handover by lawyer He and others, they have declared the termination of their agency liquidation duties. All matters thereafter will be handled by Mr. Xu in conjunction with the business resumption committee.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Improves Wharf Facilities Throughout the City</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is making every effort to improve the facilities at the wharves in the South Shanghai, Zhabei, and West Shanghai districts under its management. The bureau plans to replace the existing wooden hatches at the South Shanghai wharves with iron covers, as they are easily damaged.

<h3>Public Security Bureau Re-Registers Household Census, Scheduled for Completion by Year-End</h3>
<p>Criminals to be Included on Special Cards</p>
<p>To clarify the number of residents within the city and to facilitate statistical compilation, Cai Jingjun, director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, initiated a re-registration of the household census starting on the 16th of last month. It is reported that each sub-bureau and police station completed the work at the end of last month and compiled the collected data into various cards. Those who have been convicted of crimes and released will be included on special cards for investigation. The bureau issued instructions yesterday, requiring its subordinates to complete the compilation by the end of this year (i.e., the end of this month). Starting on New Year's Day, random checks of households can be conducted based on the newly compiled household census cards.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaomei Missing: Yu Zhenyue Accused of Extortion</h3>
<p>After Investigation, Xiao is Found to be a Prostitute. Yu Zhenyue Pays 500 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Wang Su, a woman residing at No. 27 Chengyu Lane, Meibai Road, has an adopted daughter named Zhang Xiaomei, from Changshu, currently 16 years old. She suddenly disappeared on the 10th of this month. After searching everywhere without success, at 7 p.m. yesterday, a Yongbo man named Yu Zhenyue (owner of a certain pharmacy), residing at No. 9, Lane 557, Xinjihang Road, went to Wang Su's house and said that he knew where Xiaomei had gone. If he was given 100 yuan as a "longevity fee," he could return her. The woman found Yu's attitude suspicious. Before Zhang Xiaomei left on the 10th, the maid Chai Ma had seen Yu and Xiaomei together. She reported it to the Xinzha police station, accusing Yu of extortion. The police chief dispatched Chinese detective Ye Yushan to arrest Yu and take him back to the police station. Under interrogation, Yu denied knowing Zhang's whereabouts and claimed that she was a prostitute who had stayed at Room 107 of the Jielu Hotel on the 10th for 5 yuan. After repeated interrogation, Yu claimed that the girl was now at No. 16 Dagu Road. The detective went to investigate but found no house numbered 16 on Dagu Road, realizing that Yu was lying. Yesterday morning, Yu was handed over to Qian Xunjiu, the legal advisor of the Criminal Division 2 of the First Special District Court, who explained the situation and filed charges under Article 240 of the Criminal Code. It was also stated that, according to the police investigation, Zhang was indeed a prostitute. As Zhang had not been found, a postponement was requested. Under questioning, Yu Zhenyue stated that he met Wang Su and Zhang at the Tianyunlou Art Center, and she often invited him to her house to play. Because it was late, he paid 5 yuan and then left. A day or two later, he met them again while watching a film at the Daguangming Cinema. She invited him to her house again, and as a result, they shared a room in the Jielu Hotel, which could be proven by the tea waiter. Yesterday, he went to her house after watching a movie at the Mingxing Cinema, as it was still early. He was arrested. He did not know where Zhang had gone. Detective Ye Yushan submitted a report on the arrest process and stated that Zhang Xiaomei was indeed a prostitute, but Su claimed that she had always denied it and had adopted Zhang at the age of three. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the testimonies and postponed the trial. Yu Zhenyue was allowed to be released on bail with a 500-yuan guarantee or a guarantee letter.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case in Hangzhou Cracked in Shanghai</h3>
<p>On the night of the 14th, the French Concession Police Station received a tip that a kidnapping gang was hiding at No. 40 Chunde Lane, Annakin Road, and that the hostage was also inside. The Chinese and foreign detectives dispatched patrol cars to the address to make arrests. However, there were no kidnappers, only Zhang Yongming, a nine-year-old boy from Cangqiao, Hangzhou, who had been abducted from Gongchen Bridge, Hangzhou on the 9th by kidnappers Huang Wenbiao and Shi Aizhen, a couple, and Wu Jinbiao (also known as A'gang, all from Hangzhou), who had brought him to Shanghai and hidden him. The three kidnappers, Huang, Shi, and Wu, were arrested, as well as Xu Mingfei, Shi Haian, Lu Axing, Wang Amiao, Hu Aiquan, Wu Juying, and others suspected of being involved. Because the incident occurred in Hangzhou, the police notified the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and made a long-distance call to the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau. The Hangzhou Public Security Bureau also confirmed that the case had occurred and that a kidnapper named Tu Amao had also been arrested. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau replied to the French Concession Police Station. Yesterday, the police sent the kidnappers and the abducted boy to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court for questioning. Sha Daxin, deputy captain of the detective team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrived and requested the transfer of the defendants. However, the official documents were not yet available and would be submitted later. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo questioned the defendants Huang Wenbiao, Shi Aizhen, Wu Yubiao, and the abducted child Zhang Yongming one by one, he ruled that the defendants and the abducted person should be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for trial, and temporarily detained them in the detention center, pending the submission of the documents by the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Source of Divided Money Unclear</h3>
<p>Zhuang Dexiu, captain of the detective team of the Caojiadu Public Security Sub-bureau, received a tip from an informant yesterday that bandits were dividing money of unknown origin at the Gaoshengchi Bathhouse in Bingbei. The team captain, along with deputy captain Xin Jingsheng, squad leaders Liu Bingyuan and Liu Shaoqing, and detectives Su Ruiding, Gao Fushan, Zhang Zuoxian, and Wang Zhusheng, went to investigate.

<h3>National Physician Yan Bocheng Comes to Shanghai for Treatment</h3>
<p>National Physician Yan Bocheng, with profound medical knowledge and extensive experience, practiced medicine in Shanghai for ten years and then returned to his hometown of Wenzhou to practice medicine. Patients came in droves, and he was overwhelmed. Dr. Yan was invited by a certain magnate to come to Shanghai for consultation a few days ago. Friends in Shanghai, upon hearing the news, requested that he continue to practice medicine in Shanghai to benefit patients in Shanghai, but Dr. Yan's medical practice in his hometown cannot be delayed for long. Whether he will stop returning to Wenzhou has not yet been decided.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xiaocang)</p>
<p>A person who can endure hardship and not only not feel the pain on the surface but actually enjoy it is the most likely to strive hard. A person's success is a constant struggle, without rest, until the end of their life. Their past is all struggle, all success. So does struggle not fail? No, failure due to struggle is the reverse side of success, and can also be said to be the initial stage of success. As for failure without struggle, that is true failure.</p>
<p>In society, even internationally and down to the family, the way to live is like acting in a play. The art of living is truly aligned with the art of acting. A play well-acted, spoken very realistically and naturally, seems not to be acting at all. When living well, you can't see that someone is acting.</p>
<p>People's emotions are in your control; people's rationality cannot overcome their emotions, you can control them. In this way, your supernatural powers will naturally be vast.</p>
<p>When you should speak, you should speak more, and practice your eloquence. If you speak wrongly, you must be able to rationalize it. But the most important thing is to be able to understand when you should not speak.</p>
<p>Pure justice is difficult to exist. It is best to speak of justice with your fists clenched.</p>
<h3>The Four Treasures of the Study</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Paper, ink, brush, and inkstone have been known as the four treasures of the study since ancient times. All scholars have these four treasures of the study prepared. Even nouveau riches who started as butchers or wine sellers, once their new mansion is completed, must hire a useless study, furnished with clean windows, and invite a famous person to inscribe a name for it, such as "Xuan" or "Zhai", to feign elegance. Once they have some kind of "Xuan" or "Zhai", even if they are illiterate, they must prepare a set of very exquisite paper, ink, brush, and inkstone. Although paper, ink, brush, and inkstone, for those who started as butchers or wine sellers, are at most used for recording food expenses such as "three catties of vegetables, 100 cash for tofu," they are absolutely not used for anything else. But if a study lacks the four treasures of the study, the owner will appear uncouth to an extreme degree.</p>
<p>But in these years of 1935 or 1936, no matter how noble the four treasures of the study are, they are no longer popular. Except for secretaries who specialize in writing official documents such as "as a result of" and "this," no one can break away from the four treasures of the study. All other office desks are replaced by ink and fountain pens and pencils. Although they are handling Chinese official business, when writing a "read" or approving something, they always use a red pencil. If they approve it with a Chinese brush, their subordinates will laugh their teeth out, and say behind their backs that they can't even hold a fountain pen. "Flowing water" and "fair copy" in shops still use Chinese brush and ink, but "purely Chinese commercial organizations" use foreign account books. As for young students, except for composition classes in Chinese language, where they have to reluctantly use Chinese paper, ink, brush, and inkstone, they always use fountain pens and foreign paper tucked into their upper left pocket. The four treasures of the study, today, can truly be said to be on their last legs, no wonder the owners and shopkeepers of paper and brush shops are so worried.</p>
<p>Although thread-bound books have been overthrown, they are now reviving. I wonder what the future fate of the four treasures of the study will be?</p>
<h3>The Sorrows of a Dancer</h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>On a winter night, a kerosene lamp cast a faint light. Three men sighed in unison at her unfortunate experiences!</p>
<p>According to her, "Last year, among the Shanghai dancers, I could be considered a popular dancer. What I earned in a month was more than enough to cover household expenses. However, I am naturally not fond of saving, and I spent it all arbitrarily. Later, among the many dance patrons who pursued me, I had a physical relationship with a certain gentleman, leaving behind a burden. The music stopped, and in the end, I was abandoned!" She took a sip of tea and said, "I have seen through Shanghai society. Everything is trapped by the atmosphere of depression, except for those who use their beauty to seduce, and there are still people who are willing to be intoxicated in the world of makeup all day long. Although we are now in a time of great national crisis, do they not know this? Anyway, entertainment can also save the country. But every time they buy gifts from unknown sources to make merry, which is really contradictory!"</p>
<h3>Drug Treatment</h3>
<p>The three men thought that she was a person who worshiped foreign goods, but they did not know that she was a woman with spirit. It's just that she didn't know how to save, and now she can only live in a three-room house, and the family often runs out of food, which is truly pitiful!</p>
<p>The light of the kerosene lamp on the table was getting weaker and weaker, and everything was like death. Sometimes you could still hear dogs barking.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 22: Chivalrous Words Move Painted Lips, Beautiful Women Gather for Discussion; False Feelings Startle Jade Wrist, Suffering Woman Flees Captivity</p>
<p>He then puffed out his chest and said, "If we want to seek liberation for the entire women's community, we must rescue this woman who cannot support herself. Otherwise, we will just be singing high-sounding tunes, and people will laugh at us. To make things easier, from now on, let's just refrain from speaking." After he finished speaking, he stamped his high-heeled shoes, expressing his sense of indignation. All the women in the room applauded. Bei Hai thought to himself, the way this lady is so agitated, she can overwhelm Jia Duocai's arrogance. It's just that the way he is dressed, it seems that these few words should not have been said from his mouth. What will happen later, I can't know. Just saying this, that modern woman had already sat down, and another middle-aged woman stood up. Before he had even opened his mouth, all the ladies applauded, expressing their welcome. Bei Hai looked at the attitude and knew that it was the Commissioner's wife. He said, "Since all of you gentlemen agree with my proposal, now let's elect two representatives to negotiate with that Mr. Mai. Our principle of negotiation is, first, that the one named Jia must immediately restore Ms. Zhu's freedom. Second, after Ms. Zhu is restored, we will find a job for him, and Mr. Jia must not interfere with him." As he spoke, the people in the room clapped again. He looked at everyone triumphantly. He smiled and said, "Regarding this matter, although the problem is very small, I think this may be the first expression of the women's movement in Xi'an, and we must do it well. If there are any difficulties, our Commissioner Lan can help a lot. In this society where right and wrong are unclear, the power of politics is always indispensable." As he spoke, he turned his eyes and looked at everyone. There were several female guests inside who knew that his commissioner had made a fool of himself here once, and that political power seemed to be no longer applicable. Mrs. Zhou said with a smile, "Let's rely on ourselves. Can't we do things without men?" Mrs. Lan looked at him. She said, "I'm just making a suggestion, it's not necessarily going to be done. Now that I've finished speaking, if you have any opinions, say them immediately, there's no need to delay." He sat down, and the same woman stood up again. (378)</p>
<h3>Reading Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Declaration to Foreign Countries at the Fifth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingfan</p>
<p>Your profound strategy is worthy of the title of supreme commander, using this to seek survival, you have faith that it will not be erased. Qi was too big to allow a covenant at Jia Gu, Qin was strong and wanted to govern Han Dan. Extravagant talk of betting everything is easy, a century of accumulated weakness makes compromise difficult, I hear that the news from the capital is good, Lin Xiangru, Lian Po, and Pingyuan Jun are all rejoicing together.</p>
<h3>Impromptu Poem Inspired by Yin Rugeng's Betrayal in Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingfan</p>
<p>The White Mountains and Black Waters have become desolate remnants, once again stirring up rebellion in You and Yan. I don't envy Zhang Yi's ability to wag his tongue, I pity Uncle Bao for not having a liver. The people's hearts may not return to Liu Yu, what is the will of heaven, nurturing a Han traitor? Success or failure should not depend on luck, the collapse of the Four Cardinal Principles is most chilling. (To Respond)</p>
<h3>Recording What I Saw</h3>
<p>— (Qiao Yun Su)</p>
<p>Along Jiangwan and Xiangyin Roads, on both sides of the sidewalks, there are many small ditches that have not been filled in, rising and falling with the tides of the Yangtze River. Some residual streams slowly flow in. In these stagnant ditches, there are also fish jumping around, but the number is very small. Nearby commoners, who are not formal fishermen, may not have the strength or the opportunity to do any hard labor, so they casually catch fish in these ditches to maintain their livelihoods. They don't use fishing nets, nor do they spread large nets, probably because they simply don't have the funds to buy nets. However, although they lack the tangible net to catch everything in one fell swoop, they possess the determination to do so. Looking at them learning the "Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains" method, they build two short mud dams in a two- or three-zhang ditch, and then transport the water from one ditch to the other, one basin and one spoonful at a time, working until the stream gradually dries up. All the big fish, small fish, shrimp, and crabs become "turtles in a jar." According to them, although the harvest is not small, it cannot be sold at a high price. Stagnant water fish has a muddy smell, and it does not enter the hands of a skilled cook, nor does it enter elegant vessels, and it does not enter the great hall.</p>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Rain at the Window</h3>
<p>— Zhi Shui</p>
<p>Again it was a gloomy day. On the glass window floated a heavy fog, like a backdrop to the twilight in the empty sky. The neighbors' cars had all driven away, to writing rooms or offices. Looking out the window, only two or three ayis buying vegetables, carrying baskets, passed by intermittently. Even the woman who always carried her child in the alley every morning, walking around, was nowhere to be seen. It seemed that because of the cold, the air in the alley was as dead as death, and nothing more could be found. Mr. Jin picked up his pen and put it down again. Countless confusions enveloped his heart, just like the weather. He wanted to write something, finish the manuscript, and send it to someone. Moreover, he felt very interested in this creation of his, but how could it be that in this moment, he could not gather his thoughts?</p>
<p>"The study is the prison of intellectual laborers, and a satisfactory kiss is the greatest comfort for middle-aged people." Mr. Jin sighed and kept chanting these two sentences, doubting himself. He wanted to overcome his contradictions. The greatness of life is not about hiding from reality, nor is it just about clinging to reality, but about breaking reality to gain new vitality. The activity of this vitality will give you a knowing smile. From the fragmentation of reality to the creation of reality, everyone should take on this mission. That is a meaningful life. Being confined in the study and indulging in the intoxication of kissing is only a glimpse of a weak heart, it will shatter your strong will! Middle-aged people have a vast practical experience of life and are healthier and braver than young people. That is right, Mr. Jin thought again. Facts tell people that middle-aged people are mostly weak. They have suffered the injuries of youth and the attacks of old age. This double horror bites the remaining half of their hopeful hearts, which grows the roots of timidity. Take himself, although he is thirty-nine years old, his appearance and spirit are still comparable to those of young people. What he permits is the spirit of moving forward, often stronger than that of teenagers. But memories make him waver, life makes him depressed. What he permits is that his body makes him feel that no matter how good he is, he is never as good as when he was a teenager. The feeling of being not like a middle-aged person but not being able to not be a middle-aged person, at least not being able to completely leave all middle-aged people and feel independent, all made Mr. Jin pace back and forth in the study and chant those two sentences.</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper to read, the situation in North China was tense again. Traitors? Ronin, are they one or two, it is simply impossible to tell them apart. But what can the government do? Fighting, even if we win, whose victory will it be? The masses? No. The victory of the nation and the country? Then how many times have the imperialist countries won? And how? But standing on the position of the nation, we cannot yield. Mr. Jin sighed, "Never mind it." A satisfactory kiss is the greatest comfort for middle-aged people, but where to get this satisfactory kiss? Merely the stimulation of lust, without the resonance of souls, cannot of course be considered satisfactory. This resonance of souls is even more difficult to talk about. Looking out the window, drops of rain came again. The cuckoo clock on the wall struck twelve times. It was time to eat lunch again. Still go and write the manuscript. This seemingly stable but unstable life shackles the hearts of every middle-aged person. "The study is the prison of intellectual laborers, a satisfactory kiss is the greatest comfort for middle-aged people." Mr. Jin put down the newspaper, said, and walked to the other table against the wall, picked up the teapot, and drank several mouthfuls of extremely strong rose black tea before spreading out the manuscript paper and going to eat lunch.</p>

<h3>Lianghua Mingnong Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Compete With Pirate Mai Ling to Avenge Past Defeat</p>
<p>Will Set Off for the Philippines and Singapore at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Nanjing Fifth National Games Basketball Champions, the Hebei team players Tang Baokun, Li Zhenzhong, Yin Hongxiang, Liu Zhenyuan, Zhang Jingzhi and other five generals of Lianghua, gathered in Beijing last month, actively training, and are scheduled to come to Shanghai tomorrow morning, to compete with Pirate Mai Ling and other powerful teams, to avenge their past defeat, and raise travel expenses, join famous players such as Heguoti, and set off for the Philippines and Singapore in the latter half of this month, hoping to return home before next year's preliminary election. Tang Baokun is currently serving in the Sports Department of the Central Guoshu Institute in the capital. Yin Hongxiang and Liu Zhenyuan have also recently gone to Beijing from Hankou, and are working as instructors in the training class of the Training Supervision Department, while Zhang Jingzhi is also in the Central Party Headquarters. In addition, Li Zhenzhong and others are all well-known and invincible generals of Tianjin Lianghua Five Tigers in the past. They have gathered in Beijing, without a single one missing, and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>The Five Tigers of North China once invaded Shanghai under the name of Lianghua and competed with Chinese and Western powerful teams, but were defeated by Pirate Mai Ling. This time, they reorganized their team and will take the night train from Beijing tonight to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning, acting as the Liu Lang of the past. The Mountain Sports Association is negotiating for four major battles, hoping to encircle the pirates and suppress Mai Ling, and wash away the previous defeat. In addition to the above five players, there are also Shen Yuqin, Shen Yu Gong, Xu Zhaoxiong, Yin Huanwen, Wang Youcai, Wang Shifu, Wang Zhenlun and other twelve people. The leader is Mr. Zhu Haibei. In order to get more practice opportunities, the team has recently been using the name Lianghua to consecutively defeat Youth and Central teams. After the competition in Shanghai is over, Tang Baokun, Li Zhenzhong and others will represent the group to participate in the South Seas and the Philippines. Yin, Liu, Zhang and others will follow the expedition under the name of the New Life Basketball Team. In addition to Tang and Li, the team members also include Zhang Weiqing, Zhang Chang, Wu Jiangwenzhong, Gao Changming and other more than 20 people, led by Mr. Pang Yusen, the director of the school affairs. It is expected that they will meet with Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, the principal of the school who is currently touring Europe, in Singapore. The schedule of the competition in Shanghai is listed below: 20th against Mai Ling, 23rd against Pirates, 25th against Xie Xing, 27th against Jinan or Donghua. All locations are in Zhongyuan.</p>
<h3>Negotiating Football Preliminary Election Method Rong Qizhao Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Principles Determined After Meeting with Yan Chengkun and Li Huitang in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Football Representatives Will First Go to Southeast Asia Next Spring to Improve Their Skills The Chinese football and basketball teams, which will attend the 11th World Games, are scheduled to hold preliminary elections in Shanghai in January next year. The Chinese National Sports Federation has already been actively preparing. Mr. Shen Siliang went to North China to negotiate, and the result was satisfactory. He has now returned to Shanghai. At the same time, Mr. Rong Qizhao also went to Hong Kong on the 5th of this month to discuss football and basketball matters in the South China region with Yan Chengkun, Huang Jiajun, and Li Huitang. Rong finished his business a few days ago, returned north from Hong Kong on the 13th, and arrived in Shanghai on the 15th. It is heard that the results of this trip are very satisfactory, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Changing Plans to Focus on Football and Basketball According to Rong, the Executive Yuan has allocated 170,000 yuan for our country to attend the World Games. However, due to the rising gold prices, it is still insufficient. The original plan was to send football, basketball, track and field, national martial arts, race walking, swimming and other athletes. Now the plan will be slightly changed, and only football, basketball, and track and field athletes will be sent to Germany first. Other items such as swimming, race walking, and weightlifting will depend on future funding. After this principle was decided, I went to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Hong Kong side on the preliminary election method.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Results of Negotiations in Hong Kong</p>
<p>After Rong arrived in Hong Kong, he met with Mr. Huang Jiajun, Yan Chengkun, and Li Huitang and discussed the matter. The results were very satisfactory. Three principles were determined: The original quota for each country's football team to attend the World Games was 15 people. However, our country's trip to Berlin may be weakened, so it is planned to increase the quota to 18 or 20 people. After the representatives are selected next spring, they will first go to various places in Southeast Asia to compete and improve their skills. Football representatives from each district will gather in Singapore before going to Germany. In addition, the issue of representative candidates cannot be resolved immediately due to various reasons. According to general observation, the strongest football talents in our country are in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Guangdong. Hong Kong is the most important hub, and it is hoped that more candidates will be selected.</p>
<h3>The Korean Sports Circle Plans to Send a Football Team to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Previously Sent Personnel to Shanghai to Negotiate with the Sports Association</p>
<p>The Competition Schedule Still Needs to Be Discussed Before It Can Be Determined</p>
<p>The Korean sports community recently sent a guidance from the Seoul Church University to Shanghai to negotiate the dispatch of a football team to Shanghai for competition. According to Shen Siliang of the National Sports Association, he told reporters yesterday that the dispatch of a Korean football team to Shanghai for competition was once negotiated with him by Mr. Han from Korea. The date of the football team's arrival in Shanghai and the competition schedule are yet to be discussed before they can be determined. He will come to Shanghai again in a few days, or it will be decided in a letter.</p>
<h3>Amazing Scene in the Nansing Performance: Pirates' Hard-Fought Victory</h3>
<p>The Pirates Turned Defeat into Victory in the Last Three Minutes</p>
<p>Xie Xing and Yuehan Were Also Very Nervous</p>
<p>In the West Qing Basketball Tournament, the match between Nansing and the Pirates turned into an amazing scene. Nansing's performance showed a sudden surge, leading all the way. The first half ended with a score of 25 to 23. In the second half, Nansing once held a commanding lead of 33 to 25, but unfortunately, they couldn't maintain it until the end. Only in the very last three minutes did the Pirates surpass them, resulting in a 59 to 46 victory for the Pirates. In another match, Xie Xing defeated Yuehan with a score of 56 to 36. The competition in the first half was also fierce, with Yuehan leading 19 to 18. In the Group B match, West Qing defeated the Jews with a score of 42 to 18. The schedule for tonight is as follows: 7:15 PM, Mailing vs. Tongwen (Group B); 8:00 PM, Dong vs. Jinan (Group A).</p>
<p>Pirates' Victory Was Hard-Earned</p>
<p>In the first Group A match, Nansing vs. the Pirates, Nansing's key players, Liu Jingfeng and Zhong Shimo, were absent due to monthly exams. Despite the incomplete lineup, the entire team was motivated and acted swiftly. Their coordination was also good, resulting in an impressive performance. Zhou Nu'an and Chen Wen'e, the two forwards, weaved through the enemy's basket, and their shots were almost always on target. Their performance was unprecedented. Under such circumstances, the Pirates' brilliance was completely diminished, and they could only follow from behind. Unfortunately, in the last three minutes, Nansing's stamina couldn't keep up, which led to the loss of a winnable situation, which was a great pity. At the start of the match, Nansing took the lead.</p>
<p>Taking the Initiative: Nansing took the lead at the start of the match, with a score of 9 to 6, then 11 to 8. Later, Carson scored twice, and the Pirates once took the lead with 12 to 11. However, Nansing's momentum was strong, and Zhou Nu'an and Chen Wen'e, the two forwards, seemed divinely aided in their shooting, scoring four consecutive goals, causing the Pirates to fall behind again, reaching a score of 21 to 14. After Ryan added two goals, he left the field due to an eye injury. The Pirates mustered their courage to catch up, and the first half ended with a score of 25 to 23, with Nansing leading by two points.</p>
<p>Glorious in Defeat: In the second half, Ryan returned to the field but left again after only one minute. Smith rebounded and scored, tying the score at 25. But in an instant, Nansing gained momentum again, scoring eight points in one go, making it 33 to 25. The Pirates fought desperately, with Smith and Carson showing off their skills, quickly penalizing and throwing, tying the score again at 25. After Zhou Shu'an scored, Smith also scored with a long shot, making it 37 to 37 again. This was the most tense period. The Pirates gradually improved, suddenly exceeding with 42 to 37. Nansing chased hard, and it became 42 to 42 again. At this time, there were only three minutes left. Nansing's stamina couldn't keep up, and their defense was inadequate, which was taken advantage of by the Pirates. The situation took a sharp turn for the worse, and the final result was 59 to 46.</p>
<p>Pirates' Free Throws, Fouls, and Points: Smith 4 1 1 9; Ryan 6 0 0 12; Carson 2 0 1 4; White 13 0 2 3; Bissele 2 0 0 4; Bi Xier 3 1 3 7.</p>
<p>Total: 27 5 5 59</p>
<p>Nansing's Free Throws, Fouls, and Points: Chen Wen'e 7 1 1 15; Zhou Shu'an 11 1 2 1; Qi Yongfu 4 1 2 9; Liu Zuoling 0 1 2 1; Dong Yinchu 0 0 4 0; Zhang Rangwu 0 0 0 0.</p>
<p>Total: 34 4 6 Half-time: Pirates 13 points, Nansing 25 points; Second half: Pirates 36 points, Nansing 11 points.</p>
<p>Yuehan Lost to Xie Xing</p>
<p>In the last match, Xie Xing vs. Yuehan, the competition in the first half was also very fierce. Yuehan opened the scoring with Xu Wenkui. Xie Xing exceeded with 7 to 2. But afterwards, Xie Xing played in a panic, passing without any purpose, and the defenders were also negligent. Yuehan mustered their courage to compete, and Xu Wenkui became more and more comfortable, creating a score of 12 to 7. Xie Xing scored several goals in a row by Zhou Dayun, making it a 14-point tie. Before long, it became 19 to 14. After Xu Heng and Qiu Guangxie added two goals in a row, the first half ended, with Yuehan leading by one point. The situation in the second half suddenly changed. Xie Xing shone brightly, and the score soared. Yuehan finally suffered a crushing defeat with 35 to 56. Xie Xing: Zhou Dayun 11 2 3; Xu Heng 7 2 0 16; Qiu Guangxie 4 1 1 9; Zhang Jinxiang 3 1 3 7; Weng Ren'an 0 0 1 0; Chen Zongqi 1 1 2 3.</p>

<h3>Chinese Football Club Committee Meeting Tonight</h3>

<p>Last Week's League Results: The results of the Chinese Football Club's four league games last week were not collected in time due to the remote location, so they are published today.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of the West Union Football Club's Group A</h3>
<p>——And Discussing the Situation of Each Game Last Week——</p>
<p>The several senior matches in the West Union Football Club on Saturday and Sunday were full of interest and excitement. Portugal's narrow victory over Lacrosse by one goal, Youyou's escape from death with a score of 6 to 5, and Innis's defeat of West Portuguese with a score of 4 to 0 were all fierce competitions. The Skota Cup match between Donghua and French was watched by fans. The slump in French's lineup allowed Donghua to win 3 to 1. The absence of Da Huate and Pike's injured play were major blows to French.</p>
<p>Portugal, who had defeated Donghua, only narrowly defeated Lacrosse with a score of 5 to 4. The closeness of the score was unexpected. Lacrosse had previously lost to the seemingly weak and mediocre West Business team. Their battle with Portugal showed a complete change of their weak state, making people think they were two different teams. Their spirit of hard work and effort is commendable. This result will add interest to future league games and make any team dare not underestimate the enemy.</p>
<p>West Business has been impressive since defeating their old enemy Lacrosse last time. Portugal can be called the rising team of this season. They fought Youyou in Yiyuan last Sunday. West Business always occupied a very good position, but Youyou escaped with a score of 6 to 5 through continuous efforts. West Business's defeat is truly regrettable. Therefore, although the game was not very exciting, the situation was always tense and exciting.</p>
<p>Innis is a mediocre team. It was not expected that they could defeat West Portuguese, who had previously eliminated Youyou, and it was even more unexpected that they would win by a huge score of 4 to 0. This shows that West Portuguese will focus all their efforts on the Skota Cup and ignore the league. This is a last resort due to the weakening strength of West Portuguese in this year's competition.</p>
<p>After Donghua eliminated French in the Skota Cup, their future has one less obstacle. Previously, with the efforts of the Huate brothers, French formed a 3-3 draw with Donghua. Last time, Da Huate was a spectator, and central player Pike was injured shortly after the start of the game, hobbling on one foot, and reluctantly fighting, ultimately failing. Donghua's victory certainly has its strong lineup, but the performance was mediocre, causing regret for the old and young. If they want to keep the championship, they must work hard in the future games. The recent situation of the Group A league is as follows.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association: Results of Yesterday's Five Opening Games</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held its opening game last night between Shangzhong and Guoguang. The strength of both sides can be called equal, and the battle was always tense. Shangzhong was in the lead all the way, but as time was about to run out, Guoguang scored a shot and a free throw, creating a tie of 23 to 23. In overtime, Shangzhong was still in good shape at first, but good times did not last. In the last minute, Guoguang scored consecutive long shots, reversing the defeat with a score of 29 to 24.</p>
<p>The game between Shanggong and Zhongshe 74 was one of the most exciting scenes yesterday. The whole game was tied five times, which proves the fierceness of the struggle at that time. Zhongshe's failure was because the forwards did not pay attention to the new three-second rule, which gave the opponent a chance to attack. As a result, Shanggong won with a score of 19 to 16. Although Fufeng's victory over the French army was easy, the movements of the Fufeng players were quite unique, making the persistently resisting French army at a loss, which is also worth paying attention to. The results of the five games are recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Tiecheng Cup Basketball Tournament: Qixiu Fortunate to Win Against Huadong in the Women's Group</h3>
<p>Rain Leaks in the Basketball Court, Players Somersault</p>
<p>Huadong's Failure Was Also Due to This</p>
<p>There were a total of four men's and women's Group B games in the Tiecheng Cup Basketball Tournament yesterday. Due to the rain all day, the basketball court leaked, and there were four or five places where the floor was wet. The players and referees seemed to have oil on their feet, somersaulting all the time. In total, there were more than a hundred somersaults in the four games, which greatly affected the chances of the competition. According to reports, the basketball court was newly built not long ago, and its grand architecture is known as unparalleled in the Far East. Today, it leaked in a light rain, which is shocking. I hope the engineers will repair it as soon as possible, otherwise, the wet floor will become uneven after drying and wetting again. However, the spirit of each game yesterday was very good. The Lida team was frustrated by the Law School, and their actions and words were a bit excessive. I hope they will focus on sportsmanship and not care about winning or losing. In the battle between Huadong and Qixiu, the competition was fierce. Huadong's Fan Ziwen and Lu Cuifang slipped and were injured, and their attack power was lost, which affected the overall situation. In the first half, Qixiu took the lead with 12 to 7. In the second half, Huadong worked hard to counterattack, winning slightly with a score of 7 to 6, but after calculating the total score, Qixiu still won with 19 to 14. Today's game between Sheguang and Fuyi has been requested to be postponed by Sheguang, so there are only two games. Yesterday's results: Xizang won Qianmin (B3) 40 to 13; Guangdong won Tongde (B2) 30 to 21; Law School won Lida (B1) 28 to 16; Qixiu won Huadong (Women's B) 19 to 14.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Holds Interest Test for Middle School Students</h3>
<p>As a Reference for Further Education and Employment Guidance</p>
<p>Personnel Will Be Sent to Various Schools for Testing Starting on the 21st</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has always attached great importance to guidance for further education and employment for middle school students. Every winter and summer vacation, it organizes lectures on guidance for further education and employment, inviting celebrities to give speeches and guide students on their paths. Since its implementation, it has been of great help to graduates from various schools. However, relying solely on lectures cannot provide accurate and practical guidance for students' further education and employment. Therefore, the Municipal Education Bureau is holding an interest test for middle school students this year, jointly organized by the testing and experimental groups. Based on the test results, it will be used as a reference for practical guidance. All testing materials are developed according to scientific methods and made into forms. Personnel will be sent to various schools to test starting on the 21st of this month, first testing this year's graduates and completing it by the end of the year. The test results will be compiled and statistically analyzed, and reported to the school authorities to reveal the students, and used for research. It is also planned to convene the schools being tested, and conduct group guidance based on the interests and personalities of the students obtained from the test. However, this test is not related to the knowledge and skills of the test takers. Its purpose is to observe the interests and personalities of each person and use it as a reference for further education or career selection.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Boy (1) (2) (6)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"My poor little girl, don't cry! Now you are all safe, no one will scold you again tonight," Madam Shu said, while placing Nanen in her wide embrace, stroking the two children tightly, like a hen gathering her lost chicks under her wings. "This is my fault, but I am really regretting it. I wanted to take good care of him, so I covered him up and let him sleep, and didn't touch his strawberries, although I was decorating very well. Ah; I decided never to do it again,——really never again, never again," Nanen cried, and she burst out these words in the emotion of guilt and gratitude.</p>
<p>"Now go call them and let us go home," Madam Shu said; so Tangen went and stood on the wall, and the joyful news of "hitting it" resounded everywhere on the prairie.</p>
<p>So the scattered lights everywhere swayed forward, surrounding the small group of Xiangfengweicao bushes and no insides. Then there were hugs, kisses, conversations, and even tears of emotion, so lively that the big fireflies were amazed, and the mosquitoes were also happily clear, they hummed and buzzed, reaching a feverish degree, and small moths also came in droves to celebrate together, and strange frogs competed to make croaking sounds, deafening, but it seemed not enough to express their central joy.</p>

<h3>Finance February Futures Market Entry - Bid Price Tries to Rise but Turns Back</h3>
<p>Major Players Exert Pressure, Price Falls After High Point - Resulting in a Decrease of Six Yuan and Seven Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, the February futures market opened. The Central Street price remained unchanged. Major players took advantage of the high prices to supply, leading to a gradual decline in market sentiment. The price went from high to low, with a difference of nine yuan in swap rates. The result was a decrease of more than six yuan. Early in the morning, overseas reports indicated a discrepancy between the market prices of the Bank of England and New York, resulting in no transactions. The listed price remained unchanged. Because the Bank of America had no market in London and lacked buyers, the silver companies did not release listed prices. The forward price of Montreaux fell by seven and a half to two cents. Exchange rates stabilized, and there were no movements in London. Market sentiment was stable. The Central Bank announced its listed prices, with both British and American rates unchanged. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The standard bid price remained at 1147 yuan and three jiao. Many sellers took advantage of the high prices. The preliminary off-market trading opened, rising to 52.3 yuan, but the situation seemed uninspired. This was because the swap rate difference was nine yuan. After last Saturday's noon close, it had reached 14 yuan. In comparison, there was no significant rise or fall. Major players such as Datongcheng continued to sell, and the downstream market opened in the morning at 51.5 yuan. Unexpectedly, the selling pressure from major players remained strong, and the price immediately dropped into the 50 yuan range. However, due to buyers taking advantage of the low prices, there was some rebound. Banks slightly reduced their holdings, leading to a weak market condition. HSBC Bank listed prices, with both British and American rates unchanged. There was much fluctuation in the middle. Banks engaged in bargain trading. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged. Although the price fell, it was still easy to pull up, but market sentiment continued to worsen, and selling pressure was stronger. Major players came to supply, lacking the strength to maintain the price, and it fell steadily. After the close, major players re-entered, and the market stabilized slightly after the fatigue. The after-market opening was stable. Sellers took advantage of the high prices to operate, causing a slight decline, but buyers also came to maintain the price. Soon, the price was pulled up, and there were still many sources of supply at high prices. However, due to limited transactions, the situation was mediocre. The Indian Silver Bureau initially telegraphed that spot prices had increased by four annas, with no news on forward prices. At this time, the market was still fluctuating. Later, the banks sought to reduce distant holdings, and the February U.S. dollar could be settled at 0.625. Selling pressure was slightly stronger, but after the low, it fluctuated again. Because the financial sector continued to arbitrage the swap rates, although the multi-party was willing to pay, the rate still retreated to 8.15 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 1151.5 yuan, a recovery of 9.4 yuan compared to last Saturday. Excluding the swap rate difference of nine yuan, it was only a recovery of four jiao. Hengyu Fuxing Yongzhentai Yongli Yuxin Xiangshunmao immediately began selling, dropping to 48.8 yuan. Datongcheng Hengyu Fuxing Yong took advantage of the low prices to buy, rising to 50.3 yuan. Hengyu Huixiang Richang Shunmao continued to sell. Citibank came out with a February U.S. dollar at nine yuan, retreating to 48.7 yuan. Datongcheng Fuxing Yong still bought, rising to 9.5 yuan. Qingfayong sold again to 8.8 yuan. Datongcheng Sitai Changyuan all entered, still struggling. HSBC Bank listed prices, with both British and American rates unchanged.

Huixiang Datongcheng Hengyu Chunyuan Yong sold, falling to 7.2 yuan. Fuxing Yong Qianyuan Yong Qingfayong, etc., took advantage of the low prices to buy, allowing them to support the price. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged. Datongcheng slightly advanced, rebounding to 8.3 yuan. Chunyuan Yong Tongyu Run and Floating Multi sold, gradually retreating to 5.6 yuan. Mobil purchased the January U.S. dollar at 25. Datongcheng Hengyu Richang took advantage of the low prices to advance to 6.4 yuan. Yifeng Yong Yuansheng Yong came to sell, falling to 4.2 yuan. Datongcheng Qingfayong Yongli still advanced to 5.1 yuan. Tongfu Richang resold, retreating to four yuan. Qingfayong took advantage of the low prices to re-enter. The noon close was at 1144.6 yuan, with Yuansheng Yong buying. The after-market was slightly stable. The after-market opened at 1145.7 yuan. Although Chunyuan Yong advanced to 5.8 yuan, Fuxing Yong Yuanyi sold at high prices, retreating to 4.6 yuan. Datongcheng Hengyu Li Qianyuan Yong Huixiang took advantage of the low prices to enter, rising to six yuan. Qingfayong Fuxing Yong Hengyu then sold, gradually dropping to 5.1 yuan. At this time, there were very few transactions, and the situation was peaceful. Taidecheng and Huixiang still advanced to 5.6 yuan. Tongfu Xiangfeng Qianyuan Yong Jinfeng Yong successively supplied, retreating to 4.9 yuan. Fuxing Yong Datongcheng Qingfayong, etc., still bought at low prices, rising to just over five yuan. The Indian Silver Bureau initially telegraphed that spot prices had increased by four annas, with no market for forward prices. The market situation fluctuated again. Afterwards, the buyer was slightly stagnant, and Fuxing Yong Qianyong Yong Jiarun Huixiang slightly sold, dropping to 3.6 yuan. Datongcheng Hengyu Chunyuan Yong Yuanchang Yong took advantage of the low prices to buy, rising to five yuan. Hengyu Yifeng Yong Yongli sold, retreating to 4.3 yuan. The closing price was 1144.4 yuan. The after-market was peaceful.</p>
<p>The closing price, according to the Central Bank's standard bid price, remained at 1147.3 yuan. According to the closing price, it was three yuan weaker. Compared to last Saturday, it was less than two yuan weaker. The January registration price was 1136 yuan, January was 1145 yuan, morning water compensation was 1136 yuan, and afternoon was 1135 yuan. The gold price was reduced by five yuan, to 1146.5 yuan. The spot market situation was calm. Multiple parties paid the swap rates. Therefore, Tianjin goods and boiled gold were at the same price as the bid price, and the added water was flat. Spot sources were more scarce, and there were few transactions. Yesterday, the swap rates initially started at eight and a half yuan and then retreated. Hengyu Xianghe Hengxing, etc., acted, and paying immediately retreated to 8.12 yuan. Qingfayong took advantage of the low prices to pay out, allowing the rate to be maintained. Later, Shenkang Fuxing Yong Yingfeng Heng paid out, and the rate rose to 8.6 yuan. Hengxing Datongcheng Huixiang Futaiheng paid in, and the rate decreased again. Tongfeng Heng paid Yuanmao Yong 140 times, retreating to 8.15 yuan. In the after-market, Chunyuan Yong paid Yifeng Yong Futaiheng Jingfu Datongcheng, etc., a total of more than 700 times, ranging from 8.4 yuan to 8.6 yuan. The situation was uninspired. The financial sector's pursuit of profit was still strong.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in the market. In total, Yuansheng Yong Qiafeng Yong Jiarun Richang Hengyu Wanfeng Shenfeng Tongfu Yuanmao Yong Shunmao Hongkang Yong Shunmao, etc., were on the selling side. Yifeng Yong Yicheng Hengchang Yong Huixian Fuxing Yong Dada Fuyu Yong Li Datongcheng, etc., were on the buying side. Qingfayong Yifeng Yong advanced and then retreated. Chunyuan Yong Fengchang Dingkang first retreated and then advanced. The Dalian Gang Shunli Wanxing's situation was peaceful. The Guang Gang Hengxing Shengda also lacked in and out movements.</p>
<p>Checking the market situation for the day, it was initially stable and then fatigued. The morning opening was at 1151.5 yuan, and the after-market closing was at 1144.4 yuan.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Swap Spread Widens - Banks Buy Near and Sell Far</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign reports, there were no transactions for large London strips because the market prices between London and New York were not equal. Although the listed price was flat, there was no actual market. Due to the lack of a market in London and a lack of buyers, the New York market did not publish New York silver market listing information today. However, the forward silver price of Montreaux fell by 7.5 to 2 cents. The London spot rate remained unchanged. British against American currency narrowed by 125, British against French currency remained unchanged, American against British currency was also flat, and American against French currency increased by 125. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of British exchange rate at one shilling, two pence, and three-seventy-five. The American exchange rate was 29.5 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, both British and American exchange rates were stable. The Central Bank announced its listed prices, with both British and American rates unchanged. The Customs Unit remained unchanged. After the opening, banks slightly reduced their holdings. The psychological sentiment of Chinese merchants was uninspired, but banks took advantage of the low prices to trade. HSBC Bank listed prices, with both British and American rates unchanged. The silver equalization tax announced was also flat. At this time, there was a lot of fluctuation. Although Mobil was still paying to settle, the banks then gave it back. Chinese merchants' appetite was originally stagnant, and the trend was loosening. Banks still bought at bargain prices, and the market could still be maintained at noon. In the after-market, market sentiment was stable. There was not much change in the opening. Banks slightly traded, and the process was mediocre. The Indian Silver Bureau initially telegraphed that spot prices had increased by four annas, with no mention of futures. At this time, there was still little change. However, because the swap spread widened, banks bought near and sold far, causing a slight loosening. The closing selling price of the British exchange rate spot was one shilling, two pence, and four-three-seven-five. The American exchange rate was 29.625 yuan. Compared to last Saturday, the British rate loosened by 0.0625, and the American rate hardened by 0.125. With the swap spread widening, the forward rate loosened by 0.03125 for the British currency and hardened by 0.0625 for the American currency. Chinese merchants sold more than 100,000 yuan in U.S. dollars, and the banks' appetite was average. The transaction prices for the day are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Securities Bond Sellers Gain More and More Advantage</h3>
<p>——Market Sentiment Even Weaker at Closing——</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange became more and more uninspired, with a gradual downward trend. The psychology of all gangs was weak. Multi-parties gradually sold out, and the selling pressure from the gold gang was strong. The table also tended to sell. A certain major player's layoffs of multi-parties were still rallying, but they continued to sell all other varieties, and the amount of their sales far exceeded the layoffs. It was rumored that once the sales were completed, they would prepare to spill the layoffs, which could create a terrifying situation. This is also a method of speculation. Let's keep this theory and wait for verification. From the fact that Nos. 16, 21, and 35, etc., advance and retreat, it can be seen that even those who temporarily do more feel chills and their wills are extremely uneasy. There were rumors in the market that bank deposit rates and bond interest rates would be reduced at the same time, which cannot be fully believed. The environmental situation is deteriorating. The situation in North China is becoming more and more chaotic. The patriotic calls of the academic community are becoming more and more vigorous, and the market price is still at its peak, so the future is still unpredictable. Yesterday, the market mostly failed to cheer up from beginning to end. At the opening, only the layoffs and No. 19 Guanyu were firm by 0.12 yuan, while the rest all fell by 0.05 to 0.4 yuan. Nos. 23, 67, and 78 were mostly sold, and Nos. 16 and 32 slightly bought. At the closing, Nos. 33, 35, 69, and 78 were sold, and the trend was even worse. No. 22 fell the most, by 0.6 yuan. This was because when the previous settlement was rising, a group of people believed that No. 22 had the lowest discount, which led to crowded multi-parties and difficulty in selling. It can be seen that speculators who only know one thing but not the other will inevitably fail. In the afternoon, the opening continued to trend smaller by 0.05 to 0.35 yuan. This was mostly due to the reselling of Nos. 3, 33, and 78. In the rear column, because No. 32 continued to buy, Nos. 21, 43, and 65 all had an appetite for entering, so they rebounded by 0.05 to 0.4 yuan. It was necessary to be even more uninspired at the closing. Nos. 16 and 21 turned from buying to selling, and No. 34 sold extremely much. Even the more shrewd small investors sold off one after another. The market price still entered a tired path. Although the front column was still firm, the rear column fell again by 0.12 to 0.55 yuan. The gains of the previous session were offset by the decline at the closing, so the future is really difficult to be optimistic about. The market price resulted in a small loss of between 0.23 and 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 24,412,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>
<h3>American Capitalists Sell Stocks to Avoid Taxes</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported (14th) that the New York stock market was flat. Many stocks rose slightly, but speculators were on the sidelines because Europeans were taking profits and capitalists were selling to avoid taxes. The market may be temporarily affected by the changes in miscellaneous grains. The bond market and small exchange stocks showed mixed gains and losses. Half-day transaction volume was 670,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Industry Peers Exert Power - Yarn and Cotton Both Fall - The Financial Sector's Absorbed Amount Never Released</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend was even worse. This was because the overseas cotton industry situation was unstable, coupled with the fact that the stock of yarn in this port had increased compared to the past, and industry peers unanimously tended to sell. Deliveries this month were sufficient, so the pressure was particularly strong. However, the amount absorbed by the financial sector was never released. Most of the gold industry has not yet emerged. The price of 42-count yarn fell by more than five yuan.</p>
<p>Most Months Enter the 200 Yuan Mark - The Spot Yarn for Each Month in the Morning Market Was Consistent But Fluctuating Because the American Cotton Re-entered a Tired Path, and Osaka Three Products Yarn, Except for This Month, All Broke Through the 200 Yuan Mark, Resulting in More and More Exhausted Market Sentiment. The Opening Prices All Fell by 1.5-6 jiao. The 2nd and 3rd Disks Had No Changes. Yichang and Changfeng Covered Shorts. As a Result, Each Month Fell by 0.9-1.5 jiao Compared to the Closing Price of the Previous Day. The Afternoon Opening Was Still Flat and Without Strength. The Market Transactions Were Extremely Calm. Tongcheng and Tongji Bulls Slightly Issued Orders. The Market Price Gradually Fell. As a Result, Each Month Fell by 0.5-6 jiao Compared to the Closing Price of the Previous Day. It Is Found That Dafu Sold 1,300 Bales, Tongji Sold 700 Bales, Hengyi Sold 1,450 Bales, Dafeng Sold 850 Bales, Daji Sold 900 Bales, Taixing Sold 650 Bales, Changyu Sold 650 Bales, Yuanyi Sold 600 Bales, Shenji Sold 750 Bales, and Runkang Sold 1,200 Bales.

<p>Yarn Falls by Two to Five Yuan</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn have become sluggish. It is found that all gangs bought a total of 674 bales throughout the day. The market price fell by two yuan, and the yarn fell by five yuan. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows.</p>
<p>Cotton Market Near-Month Prices Firmer Due to Continuous Purchases by Foreign Companies, While Far-Month Prices Slacken Due to the Influence of Weak Foreign Cotton. American Cotton Spot Prices Repeatedly Break Through the 1.2 Jiao Mark. Indian Cotton Trends Are Becoming More and More Weak. However, Trustworthy Long-Term Buyers Such as Changhe Tongji Meiji Are Still Not Releasing, It Is Said. In the Cotton Market Opening Market, Each Month</p>
<p>Spreading Rumors to Support Temporarily - Spot Flower Spot Prices in the Morning Market, All Months Fell Together, and the Situation Was Particularly Weak. Because American Cotton Was Weak and the Spot Market Was 1.2 Jiao, the Pass Was Repeatedly Broken, and Indian Cotton Was Also Not Good. Therefore, Selling Pressure Was Slightly Strong. Each Month Fell by Four or Five Jiao. When Shooting to the Second Disk, Rumors of Catching the Wind and Shadows Were Found in the Market, Saying That There Were Rumors of Increased Taxes on Foreign Cotton Imports. Near-Month Prices Jumped Two Jiao. The Third Disk Was Flat. As a Result, Each Dan Was Lower Than the Closing Price of the Previous Day by 0.2 to 0.45 Jiao, But This Month Did Not Move. The Afternoon Opening Was Flat. The Rumors from the Second and Third Disks Were All Inaccurate. The Morale Turned Loose. As a Result, Each Month Was Lower Than the Morning Closing Price by 0.1 to 0.15 to 0.2 Jiao. It Is Found That Changji Sold 1,000 Dan, Tongji Sold 2,300 Dan, Dafeng Sold 3,400 Dan, Daji Sold 1,800 Dan, Saifeng Sold 1,000 Dan, Dachangcheng Sold 1,000 Dan, Changfeng Sold 1,100 Dan, Runkang Sold 3,300 Dan, Shengyuan Sold 1,200 Dan, Tonghe Sold 1,400 Dan, Youxingchang Sold 3,200 Dan, Shenji Sold 1,900 Dan, Changhe Sold 1,500 Dan, and Yichang Bought 2,800 Dan.

The Highest and Lowest Prices and Closing Prices for One Day Are As Follows.</p>
<p>Cotton Factory More than Two Thousand Bales, The Current Cotton Sales Are Becoming More and More Clear, and the Factory Needs Are Slightly Available. The Source Is Yao Flower</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Warehouse Yarn Stocks Increase Greatly</p>
<p>The amount of yarn stored in the yarn and cloth exchange warehouse in this city, as of December 16, was 10,662 bales in total. Among them, 20 count Jincheng Dafa Double Horse 3 items were the largest, an increase of 8,000 bales compared to the beginning of the previous month. With this large number of chips, the pressure on the yarn market is extremely heavy. The number of bales of yarn by different counts is as follows (unit bale). The financial sector and foreign companies buy more.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Bull Market Has a Concentration Phenomenon</h3>
<p>Financial Sector and Foreign Companies Buy More</p>
<p>As of December 14, the spot cotton stock quantity of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange was checked, and the quantity was 81,900 dan for December, 114,900 dan for January, 145,600 dan for February, 173,600 for March, 189,700 dan for April, 114,500 dan for May, and a total of 819,200 dan. The amount of direct competition for stock between long and short positions was 283,700 dan. It was found that there were 30 short positions and only 23 long positions. It is conceivable that the buyers are concentrated. The largest amounts of buying and selling are excerpted below.</p>
<h3>The Spot Cotton Stocks Have Increased</h3>
<p>December 13 Survey</p>
<h3>Statistics on Imports and Exports of Indian and American Cotton</h3>
<p>In Bombay, the market was active at the beginning of the week due to the American cotton report being favorable to the long positions. However, due to the low market price of American cotton, it was also uninspired. Although manufacturers made a large number of limited price purchases, there were also many long positions settled in the market and exports sold. The external demand was flat, and the inland movements were not prosperous. The cotton farmers are unwilling to sell at the current market price and want to get a better price in the near future. Exporters are still active due to contract relations. The appendix is as follows for last week's statistics (unit 1,000 bales).</p>
<h3>Grain Imported Wheat Reports Decrease Flour and Wheat Plunge</h3>
<p>Almost Lost Independence Most Floating Multi Parties Are Helpless Wheat Prepared for Delivery</p>
<p>The flour market plummeted uniformly after the morning opening. This was because the overseas report prices, Chicago fell by one-fourth to one-and-a-half jiao, and Canada had ups and downs of one-fourth. Market sentiment, because of the slight recovery of foreign wheat, the floating multi parties, most stopped and those who profited gradually withdrew, leading to a bleak situation. The near and far terms were calculated to have fallen by between 0.3-0.4 points. Until the afternoon opening, trading suddenly turned light. Large households and some factories did not see continuous purchases, and the end of the year was approaching, customers were thinking of settling, so the market fell by about one point. Compared with the previous week, the degree of rise and fall in the morning and afternoon was about five points.</p>
<p>Wheat in each month fell back quite violently. Because this month is close to the delivery date, I heard that the short side will prepare to deliver, but most of the goods are from Hankou, and the color is not clean, so the factories are not satisfied, and the outside world has no possibility of collecting, so the fall is even more fierce, reaching a huge 1.6 jiao. The trading volume for each month in the far-term was not smooth, and there were not many customers, and because of the softening of foreign wheat, each month below January also fell by 0.8-0.9 points. Because the standard fell back very sharply, the high-priced files also reduced nearly a jiao. The opening price was 4.84 yuan for Shandong wheat, 4.78 yuan for Danyang wheat, 4.78 yuan for Yangzhou wheat, and 4.7 yuan for Tiantai wheat, a total of 1,700 bales, which were handled by Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<p>According to reports, the lowest price of foreign wheat, Argentine wheat, is equal to 0.73 jiao instead of 0.9 jiao. The confusion in the calculation is due to the large difference in import and export exchange rates being controlled by the government. According to the latest report, the export price is equal to 0.9 jiao. The public considers it to have an exciting effect, but it is slightly suspicious that buyers are willing to follow the rise and buy. Chicago wheat 13th and 14th.</p>
<p>Rainy River Rice Turns Flat</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) A total of 50 sources arrived in each city. The sales market on this street moved unsatisfactorily, and the wholesale appetite continued to be organized by Tianjin Weihaiwei, with more than 3,000 packages. In addition, the weather was cloudy and rainy, and the thin rice rose by several points again, but the Su Tong japonica was stable. The early rice sales were relatively light and showed several points of softness. Du Yangjian no longer had honor or disgrace. Yin Bian Yuan stabilized and brought tightness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 55 or 56 sources from various roads under the river. The sales of various goods in the market were bleak due to the cloudy and rainy weather, and there were few stores on the market, resulting in sluggish sales of various goods. Although there were openings, only a few buckets were sold. The market price of white japonica increased by a small number of points to one jiao, early rice was flat and tired, and the trend of high and strong thin rice was determined. Yang Jian and Bu Jian were slightly tired for several points, and the price of Bai Yuan was without honor or disgrace. The other goods were slightly soft.</p>
<p>(Hakka Indica Rice) The number of arrivals continues, and the sources from Jiangxi and Wenzhou Taizhou are endless. The passenger transformation is dull and stagnant. The market is continuing to trend downward, and the industry is pushing forward to the end of the year, and there will be many sources in the future, so they will turn to selling their previous stocks, but the new arrivals yesterday were not as surging as last week, so the market prices of each type of rice only increased by a small number of three or five points. However, the general opinion is that the market will have to fall again in the future. Yesterday, the entire Yamato Street office handled 1,700 bales of Gan rice, 1,600 bales of Wen Taizhou Yongshao rice, 535 bales of Shashi Hankou rice, and 100 bales of Siamese rice. Other arrivals are two, quiet.</p>
<p>North and South Goods Dried Longan Flesh Market Disc Quietly Loosening. The sales of dried longan flesh have recently turned dull, and there is an eagerness to sell, and sales disks are often quietly loosened, resulting in a gradual decrease in even one step, with small losses of three or several yuan. Number 1 disks have received few hands and have not officially opened at a small price. However, it is heard that the price of products from Zhangzhou has recently been selling in Nanyang, and the market price is still firm. The current price is still in the range of 100 yuan, which is extremely difficult to calculate and has become an upside-down situation. Others, such as Hainan and Tongan, are also tired and uninspired. There are not many days left in the year, and there is probably no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Domestic Turnover Rises 0.4-0.5 Jiao Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market remained firm and stable. The association’s set disk, 24 coarse sand, and white spot price were 22.15 yuan and the transshipment price was 6.9 yuan, both unchanged. The cotton white Zhenji brand of this factory was 20.9 yuan for No. 1, 0.6 jiao for No. 2, 0.2 jiao for No. 3, 19.9 yuan for No. 4, and 0.8 jiao for No. 5, an increase of 0.1 jiao. For domestic Chao Qing, such as the newly proposed Qing, the opening price rose by 0.1-0.2 jiao the day before, to 17.7 jiao, and 100 packages were traded. Yesterday, the market said that the price increase had not been achieved, and another batch of turnover was opened, from 13.5 jiao to 0.8 jiao, an increase of 0.4-0.5 jiao. Also, tens of packages of Xing Chi were opened, from 15.5 jiao to 15.3 jiao. Dong Chi High-quality goods were quoted at 17 yuan, and ordinary goods were 16.6 jiao. No. 8 white was 21.9 jiao, and the transshipment price of YT mark was 6.85 jiao. The transshipment price of TK mark was 6.875 jiao and there was some trading. No. 9 white was quoted at 21.7 jiao and the transshipment price was 6.7 jiao. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Society reached the tender sale period yesterday, and 3,023 packages of Yue coarse white were traded for 21.95 jiao, with no rise or fall, 100 packages of No. 5 cotton white for 16.85 jiao, 152 packages of No. 6 for 16.7 jiao, and 557 packages of Guangdong red for 15.5-15.3 jiao.</p>

<h3>"Shanghai" Brand Domestic Ice Cream "Peach Blossom Dream"</h3>
<p>Will be screened in the next issue at Jincheng Theater</p>
<h3>Silver Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Yun Er</p>
<p>A certain newspaper reported, "Why does Bai Yushuang want to make a movie?" The person in charge of the Unified Art Society stated their reasons. "Bai Yushuang performed at the Empire Theater in Shanghai, and almost everyone from the lower and middle classes went to see her performance. Now, to attract the upper classes, we have to have her make a movie, because movies can be shown in high-end theaters, and to have people with status watch the performance, we must first ensure the comfort of the environment."</p>
<p>I remember there used to be a saying, "Sharing happiness with the people." Looking at it this way, it's actually, sharing happiness with the upper class.</p>
<p>Is Bai Yushuang suitable for film? Looking at the sickening words of the "upper class," such as Hong Shen, who praised her as the "Oriental Mae West," it seems that we can be slightly relieved (although we are still full of doubts!). However, if film is merely a copy of the stage, then we don't need film at all. Moreover, the motivation for "pushing" Bai Yushuang onto the screen is solely to bring the "licentious" parts of the Beng Beng opera onto the screen!</p>
<p>We must give this bad tendency a severe blow!</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang's opera "Begonia Red" was contracted by Unified Art to the Star Company for 20,000 yuan to produce, and the story of this opera was conceived by Mr. "Shallow" Wang Qianbai in one day. The content can be imagined.</p>
<p>It is said that Tianyi Company is very jealous of "Begonia Red," because Tianyi also has the ambition to replace it. Another rumor says: "Begonia Red" will be filmed at the Tianyi Studio.</p>
<p>Even taking a step back, the question is whether the film censorship board will allow the "essence" (that is, the "essence" of the Beng Beng opera) licentious parts of "Begonia Red" to pass?</p>
<p>Unless the film censorship board is bewitched by the magic of the "Oriental Mae West."</p>

<h3>Trivial Talks on the Acceptance Inspection of Building Materials (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Pixian</p>
<p>The implementation of any construction project necessarily requires materials as an essential element. When the materials are delivered to the construction site, the construction supervisor and the responsible supervisor are responsible for inspecting and accepting the materials. How are materials inspected and accepted? How can materials be inspected and accepted perfectly and completely? These are the points that this article will discuss.</p>
<p>Preparation Before Acceptance Inspection</p>
<p>In order to achieve the satisfactory acceptance of materials, the person responsible for acceptance should prepare in advance before taking acceptance. Preparation is actually a very simple matter: first, the engineering regulations and construction details of the construction project should be carefully reviewed and firmly remembered. Second, the contract signed with the contractor should be carefully reviewed and also firmly remembered. Third, the samples submitted by the contractor should be inspected one by one, and the results of the inspection should be recorded in a manual. If the above three items are used as the basis for the preparation of material acceptance, then one will have a clear idea and the acceptance will be generally correct.</p>
<p>Procedures During Acceptance Inspection</p>
<p>When the contractor delivers the materials to the construction site, the acceptance inspection begins. The steps for acceptance inspection are: the first step is of course to inspect the quality of the materials. This can be based on the samples pre-paid by the contractor. If the inspected materials match the samples, then they can be unloaded and stored in the warehouse. If they do not match, then they cannot be accepted. The second step is to guide the stacking of materials. This should be based on the site topography and the convenience of work, and the location should be determined after consulting with the supervising architect, so that there will be no obstacles. Otherwise, it may affect work efficiency or incur the architect's scolding. Therefore, the stacking of materials must be properly guided. The third step is to calculate the quantity of materials. Due to the different units of material valuation, the calculation of material quantity varies accordingly. It can be divided into three methods: weighing, measuring volume, and counting. Materials measured by weight must be weighed; materials measured by volume must be measured in cubic units; materials measured by quantity must be counted.</p>
<p>Acceptance Inspection of Hydraulic Materials</p>
<p>Among the various materials used in construction, hydraulic materials are the most widely used, because hydraulic materials include bricks, tiles, mud, sand, cement, pebbles, marble, granite, etc., which are most frequently used in construction. The acceptance inspection of each hydraulic material is described separately below:</p>
<p>Acceptance Inspection of Cement - Cement has manufacturer's brands. When inspecting the quality aspect, if it is specified in advance, you only need to check whether the brand is originally sealed. However, to avoid deception by unscrupulous merchants, you can sometimes check the color and grains of the cement to see if there is any adulteration to prevent reduction in quantity. The stacking of cement should avoid rainwater, so it is advisable to store it in a shed with a cover on top, a pad underneath, and barriers on all four sides. Cement is packed in barrels, iron barrels, or sacks, so the quantity of cement is calculated by counting the number of barrels or sacks.</p>
<p>Acceptance Inspection of Sand, Mud, and Pebbles - Yellow sand, yellow mud, and pebbles are all indispensable materials for making Sanhe soil. The quality inspection, such as analyzing and testing their accurate composition by mechanical means, is beyond our capabilities. During routine acceptance inspection, attention should be paid to the following: yellow mud must be sticky when wet and not mixed with sand; yellow sand must be coarse-grained and angular, not sticky when wet, and not contain mud; pebbles must be clean in color, purely cyan, with edges and corners, and not contain impurities such as mud, sand, and mountain skin grass roots. Sand, mud, and pebbles are all bulk, so they are calculated by volume measurement, stacked into a square trapezoidal solid. The acceptor measures its height, length, width, and narrowness, and the three are multiplied to obtain the volume. The unit of volume in the British Concession is 100 cubic feet per cubic yard, and in Shanghai City it is 1 cubic meter per cubic yard. Each British cubic yard is equal to 2.83 cubic meters. When stacking, attention should be paid to having a shed on top to avoid rain and snow, and a pad underneath, so that when taking the last bit, you don't end up scraping away the soil along with it.</p>
<h3>The World's Largest Bridge (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>In the middle of San Francisco and Oakland, many engineers and workers are currently building a steel bridge across the San Francisco Bay. This steel bridge is not only large in scale, deserving the title of the world's largest, but also novel in its construction, setting a precedent in bridge construction. Originally, this bridge is divided into two sections, east and west. The east section extends from Oakland to Babauna Island in the bay, and the west section extends from Babauna Island to San Francisco. Under the west section of the bridge, there is a cement-made central pier, so tall that it can be compared to a forty-story skyscraper. In order to stabilize this pier, engineers had to design a completely novel method to sink the huge caisson that serves as the foundation of the pier to the seabed.</p>
<p>This central pier rises 300 feet above the water surface and extends 180 feet below the water surface. Atop this huge pier are placed the ends of two suspension bridges connected to each other. The distance between San Francisco and Babauna is two miles, and it is impossible to build only one suspension bridge, so a central pier must be built to connect the two suspension bridges.</p>
<p>The new-style caisson, which serves as the starting point of the pier, is shaped like a deep-bottomed barge, lined with boards all around, and with steel plates near the bottom to make the edges sharp, making it easy to cut through the soil underneath.</p>
<p>When floating, this caisson looks like a cluster of giant beehives. The so-called beehives here are the steel dome tops welded to the tops of the fifty-five vertical pipes inside the caisson. These fifty-five vertical pipes are supported by steel bars, with a diameter large enough to accommodate an ordinary elevator, and are filled with compressed air to give the caisson buoyancy. This caisson is placed in the appropriate position and maintained with cement blocks weighing 12 to 15 tons each. Piles are driven around it, and a circle of wooden fences is built to protect it from collisions from ships and underwater rocks.</p>
<p>Cement boxes are poured around the pipes until the added weight causes the caisson to sink. Workers use fire to detach the domes at the top of the pipes - only a few are removed at a time so as not to disturb the buoyancy of the caisson. New pipes, twenty feet long, are connected to each pipe from which the dome has been removed, and the tops of the new pipes are still covered with domes. At the same time, the wooden fence around the caisson is gradually raised. More cement is poured, offsetting the buoyancy of the added pipes. In this way, the caisson gradually sinks until it is 80 feet below the water surface.</p>
<p>When the caisson is deeply buried in the soil, the air pressure in the pipes is slowly released - it must be noted that the entire caisson continues to be completely vertical. All the domes at the top of the pipes are removed. Then these pipes become the "shafts" of the dredges.</p>
<p>A crane drops clam-shell dredges into the pipes, each time grabbing four cubic feet of soil. When the bucket is lifted, the soil is thrown into the nearby sea. If hard blocks are encountered, high-pressure water pipes are used to flush the water in the pipes to soften the hard blocks so that they can be easily dug up by the bucket. As the soil is dredged, the caisson gradually sinks until it stops on a rock 180 feet below the water surface. Then the bottom of the pipes is sealed with cement, and the vertical pipes are filled with water. The cement pier can be installed on top of the caisson floating out of the water.</p>
<h3>Architect's Home</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Guangzheng</p>
<p>American architect Robert Pollock designed and built his own home entirely by himself.</p>
<p>Its structure is a kind of dry construction that Mr. Luo researched. Its main focus is on fast construction, low price, beautiful appearance, and strong construction.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the parts of the house, as shown in the drawing, is a rectangle 45 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The house is divided into two floors, and the form is simple; there is also a small basement.</p>
<p>The lower floor has a workshop, toilet, kitchen, and a relatively wide living room. A dining table is placed in the living room, which also serves as a dining room. A radio is installed on the upper part of the wall, a telephone and a small folding telescopic table are installed in the middle, and bookshelves and display shelves are placed on the lower part. In this way, entertainment, communication, reading, etc. are all available. The fireplace is used for sitting around and chatting. As for the heating room, a steam boiler is installed in the basement, and a low-pressure water pipe heating system is used. The fireplace is for entertainment, so the style is very delicate and exquisite, and the heat is not very high. In its simplicity, it also has fire prevention significance. From the perspective of earthquake resistance and safety, if it is a wooden building, the fireplace is not suitable. At the same time, if the fuel for the fireplace is charcoal, it is also a simple and elegant interior decoration.</p>
<p>The upper floor consists of four bedrooms and two bathrooms (also used as toilets). The master bedroom is larger than the others, with a dressing mirror and a wardrobe with more than twenty drawers, an attached dressing room, and it is very convenient from its location to the bathroom. There is also a large wall cabinet behind the dressing room.</p>
<p>The construction method of the whole house adopts the construction style of an airship. The pillars, beams, partitions, etc. in the house are all composed of round wooden pillars and thick plates of about 1.5 feet. Indeed, this is a rare event in the United States. However, Mr. Luo's unique design is to paste aluminum foil on the inner wall pillars and install American cedar planks with beautiful stripes in appropriate places. The nails used are all made of yellow fine copper, which not only prevents the shedding of the planks, but also has a decorative effect at the same time. It can be said to be a win-win situation. Also, pasting aluminum foil on the walls can fully isolate the outside temperature, humidity, and sound, etc., because it creates a very simple and inexpensive good wall body, which is indeed a satisfactory thing.</p>
<p>Without any special skills, just removing the bark of the wood and cutting it into boards from the middle, its appearance is already quite beautiful.</p>
<p>The total construction cost is about 800 US dollars, and the land price is 130-40 US dollars. With such a value, it is possible to build a building that includes a heating room and other equipment. In the United States, where the price of goods is extremely high, this price cannot be said to be extremely low.</p>
<p>The external decoration of the unbuilt building is indeed the most painstaking thing for architects. The creation of external planks must not only be beautiful, but also consider economy, safety, etc. If there is any impropriety, it is extremely easy to reveal a poor appearance. Therefore, no matter what, the decoration of the external planks must be paid the most attention. Mr. Luo's design, from its construction to its arrangement, can be said to be quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to get a dignified feeling from the installation of external planks, the thickness of the material should also be noted. Generally, the minimum thickness of external planks must be one inch or more. However, the difference in climate in various places is also a standard for determining the thickness of external planks.</p>
<h3>Architectural Jargon (22)</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>——Regarding Use in the Construction Site——</p>
<p>Material Room——Carpenters in the construction site are distinguished by those who do the framing and those who do the finishing. Framing is some rough work, such as building the shell, erecting large materials, laying floorboards, building a five-frame structure, and doing the roofing. Finishing is making door frames, fitting doors and windows, and planing the baseboards, etc. However, the carpenters who do the finishing work do not spend the whole day in the open air like the carpenters who do the framing and the plasterers (plasterers are also distinguished, such as those who glue flower heads, pull string lines, and cover gray heads are collectively called plasterers, while others who build walls, cover tiles, etc. are called bricklayers). Because the craftsmen who do the finishing work (i.e., the old stewards) cannot do without a work stool (described earlier) for their work, they need a material room. The meaning of material room is a kind of indoor working place.</p>
<p>Waist Field——Workers in the construction site, whether carpenters, plasterers, Sanhe soil craftsmen, painters, ditch diggers, sawyers, or concrete mixers, must have certain steps in the construction of the project. Regarding the issue of the workers' departure and retention, the do-it-all (described earlier) has the power to control them at any time. They can leave when they are told to leave and come when they are told to come. As long as the wages are settled clearly when they leave, the other party will not have any objections. Moreover, there will never be any labor-capital disputes. This is called waist field. For example, the Sanhe soil craftsmen in a certain construction site have already completed the Sanhe soil work for the walls and ditches of the house. At the same time, the part of the house wall cannot be completed at once due to the reason of work infringement (described earlier). Then, the uncompleted work must be suspended, and the Sanhe soil craftsmen must also temporarily leave the waist field at this time. Waist field is the meaning of dismissal in ordinary stores.</p>
<p>Annoying Hand——Since there is the above-mentioned waist field in the construction site, the do-it-all must find another construction site to prepare the craftsmen under his command to have the opportunity to start the field during the period when the project is suspended. However, unexpected coincidences may happen. For example, the project in place A is difficult to start, and the project in place B also cannot be started. Under such circumstances, the do-it-all has to sit at home and eat. In the construction site, this name is called annoying hand.</p>
<p>Start the Field——After the owner and the foreman sign the contract for the contracted house, the foreman must sell the construction work in the project section, which is called starting the field.</p>
<p>Zhai Lao Siwu——There is a kind of supernatural act in the construction site, which is Zhai Lao Siwu. During the Zhai time, when erecting the main beam, the carpenters and plasterers must bow and salute respectfully. It is said that this can avoid all dangers. According to legend, Lao Siwu is Lu Ban of the Warring States Period. Because Lu Ban is the ancestor of the woodworking industry. At the same time, the blacksmith gang also has Lao Siwu, but it is not Lu Ban, but the Laozi who transformed into three purity on the list of gods. As for why the meaning of lighting incense and candles to Zhai Lao Siwu when erecting the main beam, I am sorry that I do not know.</p>
<p>Bamboo Green——Is the green face of the bamboo head. But the so-called bamboo green here is not to be understood as such. The bamboo green in the construction is the brush in the carpenter's ink fountain used to harmonize the ink, shaped like a broom.</p>
