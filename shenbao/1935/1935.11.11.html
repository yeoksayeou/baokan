<h3 id="c14">美國對於國際和平之責任 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自意阿之戰爭發生。國聯各國。以美國態度之不定。於實施制裁。着意愼重。近阿比西尼亞皇帝。電請美國襄助國聯。加入制裁。謂美國爲和平盡力。此正其時。美國國務卿赫爾。亦發表其廣播演說。謂美國在目前意阿戰爭中所處之地位。不僅當維持中立。且應更進一步。協助各國以促成爭端之和平解决。蓋美國外交政策。不但求避免捲入戰爭之漩渦。且應更進一步而爲和平努力也。</p>
<p>赫爾之言。其誠意爲吾人所不能懷疑。蓋彼自就國務卿之職以來。始終主張國際合作。凡關稅之减低。貨幣之安定。睦鄰政策之提倡。及黷武主義之消除。均爲彼一致之主張。然吾人今日所置疑者。赫爾將如何能實現其主張。如何能一方而使美國不捲入漩渦。而一方面仍能致力於國際和平工作耶。美國政府外交之權。不集中於總統一身。而國會之不信任總統。往往立定極嚴格之法律。迫總統奉行。使總統因此失其致力世界和平之機會與能力。中立法案。卽其明例也。</p>
<p>目前美國國會。已休會八月二十九日通過之中立法案。已使總統無與國聯合作以制裁意大利之權力。蓋中立法案者。不許總統於意阿二國。有任何偏袒之行爲。如對意禁北軍火輸出。則對阿亦然。如對意一方不利。則總統爲違法。且依照法案之現在形式。禁止軍用品之輸出。未及於銅·棉·汽油等等。使國聯禁止對意原料之供給。而美國仍將戰爭必需品之油銅棉鐵諸物。源源輸於意國。是制裁必失效。而國聯如予以干涉。必使英美發生衝突。</p>
<p>吾人以爲明智之美國政治家。當知意阿問題。非一隅之事。而爲全世界之事。如美國堅執其中立政策。形式上待意大利與阿比西尼亞爲平等。事實上以意大利需要於美國者甚大。因而袒意。則一旦世界之他隅有事。美國加入戰爭。再欲其他國家之助美國。以維持集體和平者。戞乎難矣。赫爾之輩。固深明其中關係者。故於國會通過之中立法。積極反對。下屆國會。當求其修改中立法。使總統有更大之權力。以防戰爭於未然。遠東風雲。非常緊急。美國在此一隅。必爲主角無疑。深願彼國領袖。及早覺悟。以維護歐洲集體和平者維護遠東之集體和平。保障美國永久不致捲入戰爭。其最佳之法。實爲使世界無戰爭之發生。使意阿戰爭擴大而爲國聯對意之戰爭。則必至擴大爲世界各侵略國對世界各愛好和平國之戰爭。誰有意侵略。誰希望和平。事實顯然。防大亂於未然。美國不可放棄其責任也。</p>

<p>外相至是乃言及英國人民决守對歐洲與全世界所發之諾言、繼曰、彼等並决計以其國家之全力加於世界和平之衡量中、此爲英國人民之態度、此種態度、不因經過之淸事或地理之更動、或選舉之變化而有所游移、吾人擬隨處莊嚴奮勉實行吾人之義務、擬在和平受危迫之處努力以求和平、自余在日內瓦演說後、此志未變、而在總選舉舉行後、此志亦仍不變、此種義務、使英人負有重責、英國爲保衛和平計、必須能先自衛、並須在任何集體行動中盡其充分之責、帝國防務今有嚴重之罅隙、此爲英國抒誠願爲世界表率以趨入軍縮大道之結果、在今日之狀况中、國家不能使此罅隙長此存留、世界各國政府之切求和平者、見英帝國維持和平的武力之重行整治、而得充分盡其對全世界之责任、莫不爲之寬慰、政府將以更大之果敢與保證而向前進、蓋知在和平之努力中、不列顚有堅决一致的帝國贊助之也、</p>

<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>日本自開始侵滿。迄今已達四載。此四載中·日本財政狀况·非惟不見進步。且益形衰落。民國二十一年冬間·日本政府公債·僅六十一億元。本年六月·增至百零四億·地方債四年前爲十六億八千五百萬元·至本年六月。突超過二十四億以上·國債總額·已達百三十億。此增加之五十億元。幾全爲對華用兵及擴張軍備之代價也。</p>
<p>東北四省雖饒富源，但日本欲在當地吸收利益·尙非其時·蓋東北義軍時起時伏·全境未寗·苟非再投鉅大治安經費。恐不能坐收厚利·而日本財力。早已捉襟見肘。國內創痰滿目自救不遑。焉有餘力抱注國外·况近年來國民大衆。困迫益甚·中產階級·轉爲貧民·金融界一聞政府增發公債莫不驚惶失措。大藏大臣高橋是淸。深悉財政苦衷。對於各省龐大預算·　以明敏手腕。力圖撙節·並體念民隱。不敢增稅。然則五十億元公債。究從何處直接支出耶·一言以蔽之·除銀行外。別無他途·査四年前·銀行金庫中·僅十八億一千百萬元國債。至本年七月。增至四十一憶四千六百萬元·外加地方債四億四千三百萬元。保險公司投資於國債老約五萬元·故日本支配階級內部。早已發生軋轢·即軍部的急進派。亦每以「非常時」相標榜。要求鉅額的新軍事費。穩　派則因財政前途·非常險惡·極力抑制·此高橋藏相所以去年年底警告限制對滿投資·本年七月嚴重反對增發公僓也。</p>
<p>回憶去年度海陸兩省·提出龐大的預算要求·高橋憤而辭職。其後藤井繼任·亦卒爲預算問題而犧牲·難關甫過·而陸海軍對於明年度之預算·又要求十三億元超過本年度之預算。而陸軍省且欲以十六億五千萬元鉅額。單獨成立軍備擴張五年計畫。其中九億元爲强化滿洲鞏固對俄防備之軍事設施。若欲實現此計畫。不得不增發公債。而中下階級。旣無力負担·金融組織·又甚疲敝·高橋藏相點金無術。從何得此鉅欵·於是穩慷派與急進派。通貨收縮主義者與通貨膨脹主義者。形成對峙的暗鬥矣。</p>
<p>吾人就日本金融界狀况觀之。更足知日本財力之竭蹶·譬如銀行之儲蓄·在最近四年間·形式上增加五億元。現已達三十二億元·但實際上不過移東補西·勉强調度·査一九三一年九月金庫之儲蓄額·爲十億三百萬元之國債與五億九千萬元之地方債·本年六月國債達十七億一千七百萬元。地方債九億五千萬元·換言之·即將新舊儲蓄·經國庫之手。轉配於國債。又除國債外。尙有八億五千五百萬元的半官企業債券。亦入於儲蓄部金庫中·其三十二億元儲蓄。投於有價證券中者·超過三十五億元。國債與地方債之總數百二十七億九千萬元·已有八十億元·固定於金融團體之金庫內·但日本金融團體總動員的全資力·不過百八九十億。今已半數固着於金庫中矣。</p>
<p>有價證券旣如此汜濫·公債市况又逐漸下落·四年前股票之平均最低指數。爲五九。九最近數個月間。忽發生半恐慌的暴落。七月一日東京交易所工業股票之平均行市·比一年前低落九二·因此埋藏於金庫中之有價證券·其價値已喪失百分之二十。紙幣之膨脹·雖未顯露。而形式上日本銀行之發行額。又似已减少·但朝鮮台灣二銀行則發行額反見增加。且軍需膨脹。影響全國產業之均衡發達。如本年上半期·投資於工業運輸商業等新企業者·比去年縮小百分之四八·投資於公司者·縮小百分之三三·新社債之發行·縮小百分之一五·舊社債之借換·縮小百分之七八。大多數產業生產量。在此數個月內。皆飛低减·鋼鐵同盟限制生產百分之三〇·紡識同業。强織同業。強制减工·加以各國抵制日貨傾銷。日埃通商條約。日加貿易規定，相繼毀棄。在國際上信用貸借的地位·漸次喪失。故財政當局·雖努力挽救此危急局面·然已無法彌補·設再增加龐大之軍事費·則全經濟部鬥之動搖殆難免矣。</p>

<p>— （十月十八二十一二十七二十八日對全國民衆講）中央硏究院天文硏究所研究員　陳遵媯</p>
<p>上面所說的不過是就北斗七星來說，別的恒星的排列形狀，也是一樣的變化，不過他們的變化，都要幾十萬年的長久時間，才可以覺得出來的，所以我們說他們是恒久不動，叫他們做恒星，也未嘗不可，現在我們就上面北斗的變動看起來可以知道恒星的運行，可以分做二種，一種是横截天空和我們的視綫成直角，這呌做恒星的自行。一種是和我們的視綫相合的，呌做視綫運動。我們知道這兩種運動之後，就可以知道恒星在空間的運行情形，和每杪鐘有多少里的速度太陽旣然是一個恒星，所以他也有這兩種的運行，他所運行的結果，我們全太陽系以每杪約二十公里的速度向武仙座前進。</p>
<p>恒星的運行，普通好像都是四方八面，亂七八糟的運行。但是仔細考察起來，也可以求到相當的系統。譬如星團的共同運行各團往往以同樣的速度向空間同一方向進行，彷彿一羣飛鳥同向着一個査遠的月標進行一樣。星團星雲又常常以相當速度，向我們銀河系而來，或且離我們而去這些運行的情形，都要天文家去硏究不是我們今天所能講的，又恒星中有一種叫做雙星者，就是兩個恒星的距離，非常的接近，我們眼睛看過去，是一個，用遠鏡看他，却是兩個星有時候用小遠鏡看他是一個用大遠鏡看他又是兩個這些雙星的運行，和一般恒星是一樣不過他們裏頭有一種是一個恒星環繞另一個恒星而運行的。現在已經知道恒星中成對的雙星，約有二萬對以上。</p>
<p>要之太陽系的天體，是宇宙裏頭最近我們的星，所以他們的運行，我們可以眼看而容易知道的，至於恒星而運行，則因距離我們非常遠的原故，不是一般人短時期內所能覺得的，那是屬於專門的學識，要讓天文家去研究的，上面對於日月星辰怎樣運行的情形，已經都說過了，現在要說明他們種種運行的結果所發生各種的現象，這些現象，普通我們所看見的，就是朔望兩弦，日食月食，和四季的變化。他如水星和金星的經過太陽面以及月掩星等現象，那是稍爲專門一點，我們暫時不講他，至於日月星辰的出沒現象，那是因爲地球自轉的關係，和運行是沒有關係的。</p>
<p>現在我們先講朔望兩弦的現象，什麽呌做朔望兩弦？大家都知道，這是我們從地球上所看見月亮的一種現象。我們知道陰曆初一的時候，月亮完全看不見這時候叫做朔，過二三天以後，漸漸看見了蛾眉月，再過四五天，就看見月的半面，是爲上弦，再過七八天，就可以看見全面這呌做望。以後又漸漸虧缺，過七八天又只可以看見他的半面，是爲下弦。再過七八天又完全看不見，又復爲朔。陰曆就是以朔望一周的時間作爲一個月的長短。</p>
<p>但是月亮何以有朔望兩弦的現象呢？這就是因爲日月運行的關係。我們已經知道，地球是環繞太陽而運行的。月亮又是環繞地球而運行的。上面已經說過，月亮環繞地球一周所需的時間是二十七日七時四十三分十一秒。地球若是不動，則一個月的長，當然就是這個數目了。但是實際上地球時時刻刻是環繞太陽而運行的，並不是靜止不動的，所以實際上月亮環繞地球一周所需要的時間，不止廿七日七時四十三分十一秒是要二十九日十二時四十四分三秒。又月亮自己沒有光輝的，我們所看見的光明，是太陽光照在他的上面而反射過來的原故；所以月亮的明暗變化，就是朔望兩弦的現象，完全看地球，太陽和月亮，三個的位置而變化的，當太陽地球月亮在一個直綫，而月亮又在太陽和地球中間的時候，我們在地球上面正好看見他的背面，所以他的光暗黑不明，呌做朔。自朔起經過七天多，太陽和月亮相距九十度，我們漸漸可以看見他的半面，他的光亮向西，呌做上弦。再過七八日，月亮距太陽一百八十度，地球居於中間，太陽和月亮正是相對，我們在地球上，正好看見他的正面，所以他的全面光明，呌做望。再過七八天後，月亮又距太陽九十度，我們又只能够看見他的半面，他的光亮向東，呌做下弦。以後距日漸漸又近，到了太陽和地球中間的時候，又完全黑暗回復爲朔。</p>
<p>我們因爲地球月亮運行的結果。看見月亮有朔望兩弦的現象。內行星的軌道是在地球軌道的內側，從我們地球看過去也有盈虧的現象。就是我們看見水星和金星的形狀，也是有種種的變化，是和月亮一樣的形狀，最後，我要附帶的聲明一個事情，就是現在政府所公布的歷書上面所載的朔望，是指月亮的盈虧，就是新月呌做朔，滿月呌做望，並不是說朔就是舊歷的初一，望是舊歷的十五的意思。每年中秋的時候，政府所公布歷書裏頭的日期，往往和民間所私用的　歷的中秋有一二日的差誤，他們常常以爲是歷書的錯誤，實際上不是錯誤的，是根本上的意思不同的原因，因為從前是以舊歷八月十五日為中秋，改用陽歷之後，政府爲體貼一般民衆娛樂休息起見，就把中秋，重陽等節令，搬到陽歷上面去。不過不是以八月十五日爲中秋，是以最近秋分的望日爲中秋。所以和舊歷的八月十五日有一二日之差。</p>
<p>現在我們要講日月食的現象·日月食的原理是非常的簡單。現在我先舉一個例給各位聽。就是夜晚的時候，我們點着電燈，則全屋子都是光亮，假設我們拿了大小兩個皮球，放在電燈下面，則地上或牆上一定有兩個黑影，這黑影地方，我們就看不見亮光，現在我門假設一隻手拿著小球，一隻手拿著大球，都放在電燈的下面，若然大小球和電燈成了一個直綫，則一個球的影子，必射到他球的上面，譬如小球在電燈和大球之間，則在大球上小球的影子地方，必看見電燈的所在，若設大球放在電燈和小球之間，若然大球的影子，正射在小球上面的時候，則大球上一定看小球是黑暗沒有光亮的。日月食的原因，也和這個道理一樣。我們已經知道月亮和地球自己都沒有光亮，都是藉着太陽的光反射而光亮的。並且知道地球是繞着太陽而走，月亮又繞着地球而行的，有的時候，月亮恰好走到太陽和地球的中間，有時候月亮和太陽在地球反對側。現在假設上面所說的電燈是太陽，小球是月亮，大球是地球。則當月亮在太陽和地球中間時，太陽照着月亮所生的影子達到地面上，我們所在的地方，若太陽，或且看不見太陽的一部份，這就發生了日食的現象。譬如地球在太陽和月亮的中間，太陽照着地球所成的影子，恰好對到月亮上面，則我們一定看不見月亮的光明，這就發生了月食的現象。我們因為日月地球三體位置的關係，日食月食又有種種不同的現象，就是日食有全食，偏食，環食三種；月食只有全食和偏食兩種：凡是太陽或月亮全部被食者，呌做全食，一部分被食者，呌做偏食。因爲月亮體積比太陽小，所以他有時不能擋住太陽全面，只能把中央擋住，而四面成一種環形光亮，這呌做環食。</p>
<p>從上面所說，我們已經知道日月食的現象，在天上不過是地球月亮太陽三體走到一條直綫上地位的關係。但是日食和月食，有一個大分別。就是月食的時候，月面全體或一部分在地球影子的裏面，所以無論在什麽地點或是在地球以外都能够看見同樣的月食。但是日食則不然，日食是要月亮影子的圓錐到達的地面在那裏的人物方能看見日食，並且地點入月亮影子圓錐的深淺不同，所見的日食也就各地不一樣，眞是所謂「移步換形」，所以月食的推算，要比日食簡單的多。</p>
<p>我們已經知道月亮在太陽和地球中間的時候，是朔的時候，地球在太陽和月亮中間的時候，是望的時候。所以日食一定是在朔的時候，月食一定在望的時候。我們已經知道地球是繞着太陽而運行的，一年一周，他的軌道，投影在天球上，呌做黄道，月亮是繞着地球而行的，一月一周，他的軌道呌做白道。黄道和白道，若然是相一致的，則每到朔的時候一定發生日食，每到望的時候一定發生月食。但是黄道和白道並不是一致的，他們是互相斜交的，他們傾斜的角度是五度，所以每逢朔望時候，月亮雖然在太陽地球中間，或且地球在日月中間，而緯度的南北若不相同，還是不能發生交食的現象，所以日月食雖然一定要在朔望的時候，但是朔望的時候，就不一定發生日月食的。</p>

<p>工商機關管理須知</p>
<p>該會大會通過之工商機關管理須知、原文如下、從經濟學來說、生產有三大要素、資本·土地·勞力·用比較通行的名辭來代替、土地即是原料、因爲土地是原料的來源、勞力即是一切的管理、因爲所有生產的活動、都是勞力、資本·原料·管理·這三頃固然缺一不能生產、但若比較來說、管理似占最重要地位、因爲資本·原料·都是不能活動的物質、非有管理不能運用、管理的適當與否、能增减資本原料的效用、工商管理、本是一個極複雜的名辭、其中包括事項很多、若分起類來、變可分會計管理·生產管理·事務管理·人事管理等等、這幾種管理、若研究起來、都可各成專門學科、但就我國工商業情形論、在這幾方面管理上、都有特別注意的幾項、應首先研究、所以我們簡略的提出幾項重要原則、以作參考、關於會計方面的、本委員會、已另擬「决算須知」、茲僅將生產·事務、人事·三方面管理、擇其中最重要而爲我國工商急需的、提出如下、（一）生產方法、應切實研究、我國的工商業、大多數祗知採用或模仿外人的機械或方法、作生產的工作、成績最好的能與國外的現有出品相同、成績不好的、即不必說、但外人對於機械的改良、方法的變更、時時研究改良、不斷進步、實非我國工商業固守成規者所能比擬、因此我國出產往往不能與外貨競爭、我國工商業、應對於所用的機械、所取的方法、時常根據精神的研究與分析、力求原料與時力的節省、機器成品的改進、這種硏究、要利用專門人才、决非普通見識所能應付、（二）生產成品、應制定標準、歐美各國的出品、能得用戶的信任、即在其有確定的標準、一個廠家的出品質度、及其他標準、永遠一樣、我國工業界的出品、往往沒有固定的標準、今日的貨色、可與明日的貨色不同、並且因爲種種原因、常有故意對換標準的事、這種情形、於推銷上極有妨碍、於整個工商的進展、亦有極不利的影響、所以今後對於生產成品、應根據戰於原料·機械·方法·以及市塲需要顧客心理的研究、制定嚴格的標準、（三）生產量度、應根據統計、工業中製造成品的量度、和商業中銷售貨物的量度、都不是可以揣測估計、應該根據實際推銷情形計算的、有了準確的計算、然後工業上整個的生產、商業上整個的購置、方可有通盤計劃、有了通盤計劃、營業的盈虧、方可計算淸楚、我國工商業、對於生產量度、往往毫無根據、全憑主管人主觀見解、隨意支配的、即稍有根據的、亦多是草率的估計、利用準確計算以統制生產的可說很少、因此供與求不能調劑、出品發生影響、營業感受損失、所以生產的量度、務須根據統計、以求凖確、（四）辦理事務、應避免積壓、我國工商機關生產以外的事務、如文書·會計·庶務·等、往往有積壓的惡習、本日的事、不能在當日辦完、這種情形、不限於一種原因、或因組織的不良、或因手續的不淸、或因心理的不善、但無論何種原因、這種情形、應該完全消除、因爲積壓、不但直接妨碍事務的進行、且間接對於工作的人、有不良的心理作用、可以增加這惡習的勢力、使效率大爲减低、所以無論何種事務、均應以「一日事務、一日淸了」、爲原則、（五）手續表格、應集中設計、無論何種機關、在事務方面、都有許多手續、實施這些手續、免不了應用各種表格、這種種手續表格、自然不是都在一個時候產生、乃是按照需要、隨時添加的因爲這個緣故、往往沒有系統、發生許多重複的地方、在事務上、不能經濟、且容易發生種種阻碍和流弊、所以一個機關的各種手續及應用表格、雖可隨時增改、但設計上應集中管理、方可統盤籌劃、以求連貫、規定先後、减少重複、對於整個事務效率、可以增加、（六）辦公處所應合理設置、一般機關的辦公處所、裏面的佈置、往往不定原則、毫無組織、分室辦公的、往往有關係的部份、反相隔過遠、同室辦公的、各人的位置、又常形雜亂、即距離能適宜、其他用品傢具、能安放適當的、亦復不多、這種情形、就表面論、似乎無關實要、但實際上對於事務的效率、很有影響因爲適當的設置、可以减少許多無謂的勞力、興耗費的時間、並且可使精神舒快、增加遇事淸楚的觀念、所以無論何種機關、對於辦理事務的處所、應有合理的設置、（七）任用職工、應根據合理的選擇、我國各種事業、用人不上軌道、乃是公認的現象、工商業亦未能例外、因爲私交·情面·親誼·等關係所用的人、往往不能勝任、有時發生不良現象、在一個機關中、各種工作需要不同、而社會中的人、又個個在能力學識·興趣·經騐·等等上有相異之點、什麽人應作什麽事、必需經過對雙方仔細的研究、方可斷定、工商機關欲求事業成功、對於所用的人、無論大小、必根據需要及詳細審査、方可得到最大的效力、至於選探的方法、務必根據事實、合乎需要、以科學方法、規定標準、（八）新進職工、應施行訓練、敎育機關、對於工商業的需要、無論如何設法、適應力求普遍、但對於各機關特殊的需要、恐尙不能供給、因爲各機關有各機關的歷史·組織·特性等、决不是敎育機關的敎材、所能完全包括的、所以新進用的機關職工、雖然在基本能力上、有勝任的可能、但對於機關中特殊的地方、總有需要適應的、訓練即是使新職工、在最短期間、减除不適合的情形、增加工作的效率、無論工商機關、對於所有高下職務、應都計劃訓練的程序、成爲管理工作的一部份、（九）獎懲職工、應有公平標準、獎勵與懲罰、都有增加效率的作用、這是一般機關都明瞭、並且多數有實行辦法的、但是獎懲的有效、在乎實行的公平、不論得獎金升級等酬勞、或受記過·扣薪·等處罰、都能使職工發生怨恨與不平、這類情形、不但打消原來的用意、反足妨碍全體職工的紀律、獎懲欲求公平、對於工作成績、必有詳細準確的考査方法、各種工作、必有成績標準、各人工作、必有詳細紀錄、然後可將個人與標準比較、得到獎懲根據、所以欲求獎懲公平、必先有考核成續的辦法、（十）職工福利應儘量注意、普通負管理責任的、以為對職工付完薪資、即算盡其職任、這是極短淺的見解、因為能影響工作的、不祇薪資一項、舉凡飲食·住所·醫藥·敎育·衛生·運動·娛樂·等、與生活有關的、都能增减工作的效率、所以工商業祇就本身利益着想、對於職工的福利事業、亦應按照能力範圍、儘量舉辦、務求職工在生活上安適·穩定·可以竭力的為機關效力、在我國社會中、對於職工業餘生活、尤應特別注意、以防止許多普通職業中、容易發生的流弊、以上各點、係就工商管理中最重要、及我國工商業急需實行者、摘要提出、雖不能包括一切復興工商業之事項、但如能對此十項加以完全注意、切實施行、至少可將工商管理納入正軌、使工商業往復興的路上進行、易收成效、小組委員何淸儒·駱淸華·潘仰堯·玉書·徐永祚·章乃器·金國寳·潘序倫·嚴諤聲·許曉初·李文杰·鄭澄淸·任矜蘋、</p>

<p>我們的政府，已經抱定這個主旨，忍辱負重，苦心孤意地，向這條路上前進，所以我們熱烈的期望全國的國民，尤其是海外的僑胞，來集中全民族的人力和財力，恊助政府，建設一切事業，樹立國家應有的力量。</p>
<p>寄居海外的僑胞，你們雖然有了相當的財力，稳固的事業，但是寄人籬下，受人凌辱，總非久計，我想你們一定時刻惦念着祖國，極度的希望祖國的力量，伸張到海外，使你們得到祖國的保護，同時祖國的同胞，亦日夜惦念着你們，熟烈的希望你們的資力，投集到祖國，使祖國得到你們的帮助。</p>
<p>海外的僑胞們，你們不要觀望，你們不要懷疑，祖國需要你們帮助的時候到了，你們看菲列濱的華僑，已經開始第一步的先鋒來投資創辦實業，他們集合五十萬元資本，在上海創辦「華菲烟草公司」，開辦不過兩個月，他們的出品，已經蜚聲海上，求過於供了。</p>
<p>我們因爲很重視這個先鋒，特地去訪問創辦人林朝聘·鄺光林·兩位先生，同時參觀他們的烟廠，承林先生親自領導參觀各部製造工作，並詳加說明，鄺先生詳述籌辦經過，和菲列濱華僑情形如次。</p>
<p>菲島華僑之財力</p>
<p>華僑在菲列濱者，大槪有十五萬人之譜，多數楚經營工商業的，譬如糖·烟草·椰油·爆竹·等類，幾乎完全爲我們華僑所經營，所以華僑在整個菲列濱開設的雜貨店，竟達三千餘所之多，因此華僑在菲列濱的經濟力量，亦頗爲雄厚，約佔全部經濟勢力的百分之八十，但楚近年以來，因爲日本的南進政策，積極進行，華僑亦受其打擊，經濟力量，就日益衰落下去，現在大約祗剩百分之六十五左右了。</p>
<p>從前一班華僑，總以爲我們政府沒有相當的保障，對於祖國的投資，都抱着觀望態度，自從一九三三年的年底，立法院孫院長去過菲列濱一次，當時孫院長竭力鼓勵着華僑回國投資，一九三四年上半年，實業部長陳公博·和前任外交部長王正廷，亦先後到菲島，分赴各處慰問僑胞，並竭力勸其回國投資，振典實業，菲島華僑經過這幾位政府大員的鼓勵和慰問以後，才一變以前的觀望態度，决定回國投資。</p>
<p>華菲籌務的經過</p>
<p>菲島華僑，在十八年前，曾經集資三萬元，在菲島創辦一個「菲島華僑烟公司」，歷年以來，營業極爲發達，每年都有贏餘，直到現在，已經擴充到一千萬元菲幣的資本，爲全世界華僑經營最大的烟廠。</p>
<p>去年鄺君在上海時，跟實業部陳部長經過數度的接洽，决定籌集國幣五十萬元，在上海創辦「華菲烟草公司」，其中四十萬元，由菲島華僑烟公司認股四分之一，還有四分之三，均由菲島華僑集合，另外十萬元，留到國內募集，他們把五十萬元資本齊集以後，在去年三月間，開始籌備，到今年八月二十日，在齊齊哈爾路正式宣吿成立，同時聘請「菲島華僑烟公司」富有經騐的林朝聘先生來主持一切，這個「華菲烟草公司」，是菲列濱華僑第一次回國投資，他們認爲是試騐性質，如果試騐成績好的話，以後就可以浩浩蕩蕩，源源不絕的來了。</p>
<p>「菲島華僑烟公司」在兩年前發明三種烟，（一）「雪茄麗」，就是「白宮牌」，美國政府，准許他們專利十七年，美國的加拿大和香港政府，亦准許他們專賣，中國政府准許專利五年，華菲烟草公　之出品，以此爲最名貴，（二）「黑姑娘」，（三）「英雄牌」，這兩種烟因爲烟味好，價錢低，現在已經求過於供了，該公司所用烟葉，多數由菲島運來，而且是華僑自己種植，其中有四分之一在國內採辦，另外尙有極少數是從美國買來的。（未完）</p>

<p>經濟專刊「偽滿」新通貨政策之批判  方秋葦　　（一）日本統治滿洲金融之意義　　日本在其統治下的滿洲，三年以來，除了很迅速地完成了交通統制之外，更成功了金融統制的目的。要之，日本的這一成功，它是有著重大的意義而成功的。　　一九三三年六月十日大阪朝日新聞說得很明白：關於日滿統制經濟基礎之日滿金融統制問題，如具體見諸實行，則日本資本之投入滿洲，極爲便利；經濟全體之連絡統制，愈爲緊密，貢獻於日滿兩國經濟之繁榮者，亦至偉大。如從前，日本資本設立公司於「滿洲國」內的時候，則日本資本家一方須設以「滿洲國」幣計算之公司於「滿洲國」內，他方復須設立以日元計算乏認股公司於日本，招募股份，易言之，即新起一事業，必須成立二公司，疊牀架屋，不便殊甚。若日滿金融統制成立，貨幣障壁槪可消除，一方復可招徠日本資本於滿洲，他方亦可抑制日圓與「滿洲國」幣滙價之動搖。　所　日滿金融統制的意義，在日本看來便是這樣。　　這個意義不是別的，是日本對滿洲金融之統制，在施行一種貨幣的管轄手段。何謂貨幣的管轄手段？說起來，其意義也很簡單。　　原來，世界上祇有宗主國對於殖民地配，才是以貨幣的管轄爲其重要的手段。民地必要和宗主國處於貨幣本位之下，然後示主國的金融勢力，才可以在殖民地取得經濟以至財政底支配。此種手段，爲資本主義的先進國家所慣用的方法。輓近以來，資本主義後來控制中國。記得，一九一八年曹汝霖以日本政治金融勢力為背景的所謂「金券條例」，即是這種作用。現在，日本對其統治下的滿洲，也倡行所謂「日滿幣制統一」，其作用即不外是以宗主國支配殖民地之方法，而從事於貨幣管轄手段之講求，與其他資主義先進國控制殖民地之方法，可算是如出一轍。　　明白了以上的意義，而來分析日本對東北金融統制之目的，尤其是新通貨制度之建立，有形地無形地陷滿洲貨幣於「日圓體系」之內，其意義是怎樣的，那就會明白了。　　（二）「貨幣法」之分析　　現在要進一步地硏究：日本在「日滿金融統制」的路綫之下，牠將怎樣完成貨幣管轄手段？其所表現的意義究是些什麽？事實上，完成這一個手段的，是一九三二年六月所成立的「滿洲中央銀行」。與其說「滿洲中央銀行」，是「滿洲國」銀行之銀行，毌寗說是作爲日本在滿洲的金融資本集團的尾閭，畢竟還與事實恰當。單就日本金融資本在滿洲的事業投資一項來說，據最近的統計共達四億八千一百萬元（一九三五年二月二十四日華聯社東京消息），差不多都是「滿洲中央銀行」的轉手。如果再加上滿鐵的投資，則日本自九一八以後對滿洲之投資，共有五億元。（據滿鐵調查會的槪算）另外，「滿洲中央銀行」發揮着最大的功能，即是用貨幣管轄手段，夷滿洲的貨幣於日圓體系之內，實現了「日滿貨幣統一」的旣定政策。　　不過，日本對於這個政策之完成，將取怎樣的貨幣本位而統制之呢？換言之，採取金本位呢？採取銀本位呢？採取紙本位呢？關於近些支節的問題，在日本的統治者有些爭論，結果還是正金銀行的總理即現在的大藏省財相高橋的銀本位的主張佔勝了。　　貨幣本位制旣决定爲銀本位，一九三二年六月十一日「滿洲中央銀行」便頒佈一種「新貨幣法」，根據這個貨幣法而產生了新貨幣制，其內容與機械大體如左：　　（一）貨幣之本位爲銀本位，以純銀重二三·九一公分爲價格之單位，稱之曰圓。此重量爲現大洋之平均含有純銀分，與中國國幣條件所規定之一圓銀貨重量相同。　　（二）貨幣製造權及發行權專屬於政府，由中央銀行實施之。　　（三）貨幣之計算，依十進法計算，其基本單位爲圓；圓之十分之一爲角，百分之一爲分，千分之一爲釐。　　（四）貨幣之種類，有紙幣及鑄幣兩種。紙幣爲無限制法幣，有一百圓，十圓，五圓，一圓，五角五種，這是一種法幣，可以無限制通用。鑄幣爲制限法幣，共有四種，一角及五分的爲鎳幣，一分及五厘的爲銅幣，鑄幣的通行有一定限制，每次使用額最高不能超過額面的一百倍。鑄幣之成色重量如下；　　（一）一角鎳幣總量三公分（其中鎳占二五％，銅占七五％）　　（二）五分鎳幣總量二公分（成色與一角二幣同）　　（三）一分銅幣總量三·五公分（銅九五，錫四，亞鉛一）　　（四）五厘銅幣總量三·五公分（成色與一分銅幣同）　　（五）紙幣發行準備，規定須有三成現金（現金準備包括銀塊，金塊，確實的外國通貨或存放在外國銀行的金銀存欵）其中七成，則爲保障準備（保障準備包括公債券，由政府發行或由政行保證的票據，及其他確實的證券或商業票據。）　　（以上摘譯自「滿日年鑑」一六頁一九三五年版）　　在這個「貨幣法」中，有幾點是值得注意的：第一，僞滿的幣制雖號稱爲銀本位，因單位之圓幣並無鑄造，實非銀本位；第二，紙幣之兌換，在「貨幣法」並無明文規定，僅解釋為一種不換紙幣；第三，紙幣發行額，額有三成現金準備，但要使準備金與紙幣發生關聯作用，　須有紙幣兌現或匯兌兌換為紐帶，才能調節通貨而致通貨價値安定。此「貨幣貨」所產生的新貨幣制，則與此反是；第四，所謂保證準備，難爲公債及商業票據（大致楚指「滿洲國」為建設事項所發行的公債及「國營事業」的商業票據（此種一紙空頭的信用膨脹，祇是有利於日本的。　　從以上幾點看來，可以知道日本對於滿洲所樹立的新貨幣政策，原來是著眼於日本的利益上：所謂「日本資本招徠於滿洲」者，不過是利用「滿洲中央銀行以通貨膨脹的方法，增加幣材的流通，作為日本在滿洲的投資吧了。像這樣的貨幣本位，當然最好是施行一種紙本位了。　　（三）通貨膨脹之出現　　依據日「滿」方面的紀載，自「貨幣法」頒佈以後，即從事於舊通貨之整理。一九一三二年六月二十七日公佈所謂舊紙幣整理辦法，同月一十八日又公佈舊貨幣的換算率，以作爲整理滿洲通貨的基礎。該項換算率，依各種舊貨幣的市價不同。。最高　中國，交通兩行所發行的哈爾濱大洋票，每一元可換一元（舊紙幣一元換新紙幣一元）外，最低如前東三省官銀號及公濟平市銀錢號所發行之奉票，每六十元始能換一元。（詳載一九三四年「滿洲國年報」P5I2）此項整理辦法，於兩年內中兌換有效，否則即失其效力。據「滿洲中央銀行」總裁榮原的報吿：幣之收回，至一九三四年六月末，還收額合國幣八千五百五十一萬四千元，其數爲銀行成立時所承繼舊幣一億四千二百二十三萬四千元之六成有餘，內中吉林大洋票收因原數之八成二分爲最高，其次奉票收回原數七分七厘，最低者爲哈大洋票僅有三成，其他各舊幣均收回六成以下，足以表示良好機會。（滿蒙事報三卷十號載「最近之滿洲中央銀行一文」雖然此種「成績」，爲日本對滿洲金融統制的「良好成績」，然而被榨取者還是滿洲的人民。這種現象如一九二三年時的情形；往往有在先有百萬馬克的家資者，轉臃間就會成一文莫名的窮光蛋的慘事，並沒有多大的不同。究竟是誰得了利益呢？不消說是有貨幣管轄權的人——日本，牠握着滿洲的紙幣發行權，而利用其金融機關（滿洲中央銀行），儘量營薄厚利。一方面，以少許的印刷費，便可以在一張票面上註定十元或五十元，甚至百元也可以的鈔票；而另一方面因了政治上的權力，可以任意發行，同時更利用政治上的權力去禁止現金出口，和禁止其他銀行發行，所以「滿洲中央銀行」兩年以來所發行的鈔票，可以自由在僞滿境地行使。現在可將「滿洲中央銀行」的紙幣發行列表如下：　　僞滿三年來通貨發行額及現金準備率（單位元）　　年月日別　發行額　現金準備率　　一九三二年七月一日　一四三、二三四、八八一　五六·六％　　十二月末日　一五一、八六五、三九五　五一·三％　　一九三三年一月末日　一五四、八五一、六〇三　五六·七％　　二月同　一四六、四四一、一六一　四六·七％　　三月同　一三六、三五三、三四七　五八·〇％　　四月同　一三〇、〇八一、〇四一　五六·六％　　五月同　一二四、一九三、三九〇　五九·〇％　　六月同　一一二、二六三、五一九　六七·八％　　七月同　一一〇、三六五、二六七　六八·三％　　八月同　一〇七、四九〇、四四一　六六·九％　　九月同　一〇八、四一〇、六四七　六三·七％　　十月同　一一一、八六九、五六八　五六·二％　　十一月同一一二、六五三、七二九　五五·五％　　十二月同　一二九、二二三、六三七　五二·三％　　一九三一年一月末日一二九、八〇九、八六八　五二·八％　　二月同　一三四、〇二七、五七四　五一·二％　　三月同　一二五、五九六、六九三　五四·二％　　四月同一一五、八五七、九二三　五五·九％　　五月同　一〇六、一四五、三三〇　五五·〇％　　從上表觀之，可知紙幣發行額最多的爲一九三三年一月，發行共達一億五千元四百八十五萬餘元，其現金準備僅爲百另之五六·七％，此乃爲一種最危險的狀態。分外，保證準備（包括公債券，商業票據等）僅少於現金準備，但僞滿政府信用制度是否確立，還是一個很大的問題。如果，僞滿政府信用制度未能確立，僅以一紙空文的公債券及票據，而要與現金準備發生同樣的信用保證，决爲不可能。此毬情形，必演成（三元現金，發行十元紙幣）的狀態。那麼，滿洲舊有的紙幣雖被毀滅了，而新的紙幣又代替而起，以牙還牙的辦法，不外是說明日本對於滿洲金融之統制，乃是實行的一種通貨膨脹而已！　　的確、現在的滿洲，已成了「紙幣世界」，在紙幣流通額中，除了「滿洲中央銀行」按月發行的增加之外，尙有日本及朝鮮金券的流行，據可靠調査：從來在關東州爲流通範圍的朝鮮銀行金券（自一九三二年七月之七千萬元，至一九三三年十二月末，已增長為一億五千萬元）及日金票在滿洲境內流行頗多，已形成滿洲通貨之金銀交錯。要之此種形勢，朝鮮銀行與正金銀行當然不能為偽滿的商業銀行或匯兌銀行而屆居於「滿洲中央銀行」之下，同時，「滿洲中央銀行」更非「銀行之銀行」，在不能高合匯兌的金銀交錯之塲面下，必將爲現階段滿洲幣制上不能克服的矛盾。　　正因爲矛盾愈多，日本才能以宗主國對付殖民地的方法，而實行幣制管轄手段，始能獲得若干格外的權益。單就「滿洲國」紙幣每元之價格，超出日金每元之上這一點說來，就是日本對滿　出貿易有利的。不過，這雖然楚對日本極端有利的，但在滿洲經濟機構上，却種下不少的危機，漸漸顯示通貨膨脹的破綻來。　　現在，更要證明「滿洲中央銀行」紙幣發行額現金準備之基礎的薄弱。關於這一點，可以從「滿洲中央銀行」鑄幣的發行額上，來證明僞滿所實行通貨膨脹的眞實狀况。據「滿日年鑑」（一九三五年版）所載，僞滿鑄幣發行，有如下表：　　偽滿中央銀行鑄貨發行額（單位千元）　　年月日別　白銅一角　白銅五分　青銅一分　青銅五厘　合計　　一九三三五月末日　七　三　一〇　　六月同　一二五　一九　一四四　　七月同　二四九　二九　八二　二七一　　八月同　二四九　二九　八　二　二八八　　九月同　四二九　三〇　一四　二　四七五　　十月同　七三三　三六一四　一四　二　七八七　　十一月同　一·二五一　七九　一四　二　一、三四七　　十二月同一·九九九　一五一　一五　二　二、一六九　　一九三四一月末日　二·二三二　一八一　九三　二　二、五〇八　　二月同　三·一〇八　一二八　一二三　二　四、〇五二　　三月同　四·五五〇　五一四　一三五　二　五、二九二　　四月同　五·七六八　七二〇　三二五　五三　六、八六七　　五月同九·〇八六　七二一　七二一　五三　一〇、一八五　　從上表看；表面上似乎「滿洲中央銀行」鑄幣每月均有增加，勢爲現金準備增加的一種表現；實則所鑄造的完全爲一種輔幣（將滿洲舊有輔幣銷毀，另鑄新的輔幣吧丁），單位圓幣並無鑄造。雖則，「滿洲中央銀行」是以銀本位爲號召，實際上所謂銀者，乃是以銀爲本位的紙幣發行。此種雷厲風行的結果，乃是通貨膨脹最嚴重的塲合。要之，通貨膨脹在滿洲實行，是具有偌大的危險性，那將不利於「王道樂土」之前途的！　　（四）通貨膨脹之破綻　　僞滿通貨膨脹的形態，在「滿洲中央銀行「發行增加上已表現出來了。不過此種形態中的最主要的形態，是兼有增發公債及滙兌低落兩種形態之長而有之的。（因爲在這種形態下面必然要增發公債，並且必然會使對外滙兌價格低落）此爲一種露骨的，不能掩飾的事實。　　三年以來，所謂「滿洲國」公債的增發，與銀行紙幣發行額的增大，這種形態從政府的立塲說來，是足以損失信用的。現在可將「滿洲國」數年以來所發行的公債列成一個表：　　僞滿三年來公債發行表　　公債名稱　金額　用途　成立日期年　　朝鮮銀行借欵　二〇·〇〇〇　建國之用　三一、五　　建國

<p>春秋點滴  （醉樵）　　對於國家的一切，沒有絲毫知覺，完全沒有心肝的人們，於是比他爲凉血動物，魚蝦這類的東西；其實魚蝦之類，是老饕們最歡迎的，想起了它的味道，莫不食指大動，涎垂三尺，定要去嘗試嘗試，所以魚蝦在社會上，能有永遠的存在性！　　無論踏進那處小菜塲，嗅覺裏總透進一般魚蝦的腥臭，但是到了菜館裏，經過庖人之手，却又香美擈鼻；這恰等於一個無心肝的人，我們覺得他腥臭不可言，可是到了執掌威權者們的手裏，轉撥自如，在他那裏，轉又香風十里了。　　魚蝦在水裏，一天一天的繁殖着，供人們的大嚼，它再也不會有滅種之患；所以一般沒心肝的人，也日夜造着一批一批脅肩諂笑，忍辱求榮的小傢伙，來供巨魔利用着！　　魚蝦，我們拚命的去吃，也不會把它吃盡；正如無心肝者，我們隨便怎樣去咒詛他，指謫他，而他決不會改過自新的！旗袍應改稱頎袍  秋郞　　衣，食，住，行，是人生四大要素，誰也不能缺一的，不過，因時代的推移，人車的演進，對於這四要素，隨時而異，就「衣」而論，男子的服裝，比較固定些，惟有婦女的衣着，却時常在變易式樣，或長，或短，或寬，或窄，尤其是豪貴家庭的摩登女郞，幾有旦夕翻新花樣之槪。但現社會的普通婦女，外服多穿着長及於踝的所謂旗袍，循氣候的寒暑，而更易着單，夾，綿，裘的各種質料，在夏日着單旗袍，（也稱旗衫）旣顯現着輕盈飄拂，嬝娜多姿，而在冬季着綿或裘的旗袍，又表示着雍容華貴，舉止大方，至於防風禦寒，更勝從前半截式的冬服多多了。惟「旗袍」之名，是沿用淸室女裝的舊呼，民國肇造迄今，已閱念四年之久，應早有改稱之必要，數年前，雖曾有人倡呼爲「旗袍」，更有改稱「齊袍」的，但於意義上總覺欠妥，故難普遍，最近中委張知本，在京發表談話，名稱應改正者三項，旗袍亦此中之一，據張委員說；「旗袍」應改稱「頎袍」按；（辭源）「頎」字的解釋爲「長貌」，（詩經）「頎而長兮」，旗袍本爲長及全身的女服，今改稱頎袍，很爲貼切，願社會人士，卽日更正此名爲當。「遺愛難忘」  闌刪　　雙木先生死了，享壽不過四十多歲。有一個靑年送來一張祭幛，四個金色大字剪成了「遺愛難忘」的字樣。　　大家都以爲這位靑年與雙木先生非親非故，又素無良好的交情，何必如此破費呢？而且雙木先生生平不曾爲官作宰，也沒有什麽流風善政在人耳目，這四個字兒也有點不着邊際。　　但據深悉內幕的人說：這靑年用此四字，楚另有深意存焉的。爲了雙木先生有一位女公子，姿容曼妙，向在某某女中肄業，因友人之介，得識此靑年，戀愛達到最高點時，彼此有同衾之願，但不知所因何故，雙木先生對於此項婚事，始終反對着。說做做朋友尙可以，要結婚却不能。大約這靑年在雙木先生眼裏，總有幾分未能符合他的「擇婿標準」的吧？實則這靑年據說倒是一個君子人，只不過稍嫌闊綽一點而已。大家都說雙木先生的個性原是這樣固執的，而雙木夫人對於這婚事却很贊成。　　明白了這事情的因由，我們對於這靑年爲什麽要用此四字的原故，也就瞭然了。意思是說：你老先生是歸去了，但遺下來的令愛，無論如何我是忘不了的呢！　　但願將來守孝期滿，有情人終成眷屬，那時候再賦「長母相忘」之章呢！搶親  馬佛生　　是一個新霽的傍晚，地上濕濕的。本來預備出去買一點東西，因爲這裏過去是有一段泥路，所以只好立在門前望那新秋的晚景。　　這裏是一個離市不遠的鄉下，也是一個鬧中取靜的好去處。所以在平時，這時候楚很少行人了。但是，不知為着什麽，霎時溇外是起了極大的騷擾了，於是我不顧泥路，也趕去看。　　「呀！我的心肝寳貝呀！還只十五歲呀！你們這……把我的……搶去了。」是一個中年婦人在哭着。於是我立刻明白了，這是搶親的一幕。在這裏，這風氣近年來是很旺盛了。　　在社戲裏是常有看到的一花臉公子搶親」。但那是風流的勾當。現在，差不多是原始社會的復活了。一個三十多歲的男子訂了婚，一個差不多年紀的女子許了嫁；這已經是所謂「婚嫁愆期」了的。但是因爲社會的習俗，這「婚嫁的儀式」楚少不了要舉行的。可是，在這個農村破了產的年頭，誰還有能力來費幾十塊錢的費用，加多一個吃口。誰還有能力損失百餘塊錢，嫁出一個女兒。於是，在這個畸形社會組織之下：「婚嫁」，也同化的畸形了。不得已而就其次，在男女家雙方秘密允許之下，於是男方邀幾個人（新郞自己也加入），備一隻船，偸往女方。强迫把新婦搶來，女方佯爲不聞。男方把新婦搶了過來之後，擇一個好日，就舉行交拜。這時女方也要備一點嫁妝送去，不過是極徵極徵的。這樣雙方就算通過相歡了。　　這種文明的「搶」，不需對敵，不犯法律：於是在這農村破產的年頭，就一日千里的發達了。御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　當下太后也不過於窘他，祇低下了頭，自己默默地思慮起來，慶親王等都極嚴肅地在下面候着，而且各人都竭力裝着一副愛國忠君的容顏，表示他們也跟太后一樣的在上心思。這樣靜默了十來分鐘模樣，太后便用着很高亢的聲音說道：　　『古人說得好：「養兵千日，用在一朝，」難道我們的兵平日一般也楚有吃有穿的，到得國家有事時，便一次都用不來他們嗎？這一回無論有事或無事，我們都不能不有些準備！就着兵部趕快調集幾路兵馬，卽使他們祇够打一仗，也得用上一用！』　　太后這幾句話裏頭是很有些芒刺的，我一聽便知道伊是的確有感而發了；慶親王也未嘗不瞭解，便是其餘那些靜着一言不發的大臣也個個都理會得。因爲那時候的中國軍隊，委實是太糟了。但太后雖明知伊的軍隊的無用，却依舊主張要在可能範圍之中，作相當的準備：就是慶親王所說的日俄兩國作戰與中國無關的話果然是眞的，但也得稍事佈置，以防萬一。　　於是伊又繼續說道：　　『我們要注意：每一次在我們國境以內，或國境附近發生戰事時，無論是中國人跟外國人打，或是外國人跟外國人打，打到結果，總是把我們中國晦氣，一大方一大方的土地送給人家；這樣的好事情，誰能保得定這一回不再發生呢！我相信日本和俄羅斯這兩個國家，此番的所以開戰無非是雙方都想併吞我們的東三省而起的初部角鬥罷了。（四五四）小西天  張恨水著　　第二十一回　婉轉依人過庭憐月貌激昂訓壻隔室聽獅聲　　這兩個孩子，肚皮漲得像大鼓一樣，都倒在灶脚下，一動也不能動，原來是漲死過去了。好容易，靜靜的讓孩子們睡了兩天，才活轉過來。我當時聽了這句話，以爲我那同鄉是形容過甚，可是他賭咒發誓說這是眞事。現在照着你們的話看來，那果然是把吃麵條，當一回新鮮事了。朱老太道：周太太，你是天堂裏的人，那裏會知道我們窮人過的苦日子，在我們那裏的人，兩三年不見着白麵的人，也是很多很多呀。周太太道：那終年吃些什麽東西呢？他說到這裏，就想由這一點，又問到他們的生活上去。可是就在這個當兒，聽到茶房突然的叫道：賈先生回來了。只這一聲，月英臉上，早是一陣由紅變到蒼白，瞪了兩隻眼睛，兩手扶了桌沿站立起來，只管向窗戶外邊呆望着。周太太道：不要害怕，賈先生也不是老虎可以吃人，你就是得罪了他，至多也不過楚彼此撒手罷了，他也决不能把你吃下，何必怕他？萬一他要和你爲難，有我在這裏，我可以和你作主，你放心罷。月英的聲音，有些帶了抖顫，向周太太苦笑着道：楚的，我要請你帮着我一點忙，要不，我不不……不得了的。周太太看了這樣子，眞有些替婦女們歎氣，便挺身而出，走到過廳裏站着。（三五八）風土小記記香河縣與武垣  寒若　　香河距北平約一百華里，與實坻，武淸，三河，通縣等縣爲鄰。余於四年前，曾因工作，一履其地，該縣縣城甚小，離通州約六十華里，交通工具，僅有驢子及人力車，運輸農產品，則賴大車。該縣在河北省爲一三等小縣，縣城似爲一長方形，南北較長於東西，城內街道極少而短，無商業可言。鄕人來城交易，有一定之集日，市集在民衆敎育館之前，一逢集日，城內物攤遍地，鄕人　藍挑筐來城赴集，城內頓形熱鬧，過午即相率出城，如此每旬日約有兩次，除市集日，城內極爲靜寂。縣城有女子中學及男子中學一所，郵局一所，縣敎育局則設於東門城樓上，即此次事變，縣公務人員縋城逃出之魁星樓是也。　　縣城內有較大之旅舍兩兩所，魁盛居即其一。所謂大旅舍者，僅有房舍三數所，最貴者官房售價一角五分毛票一日，室內除兩土坑誧以蘆蓆外，僅置矮桌一，長凳二，別無長物，入晚則油燈一盞，兼以院內驢糞臭味撲鼻，室內臭虫或跳蝨騷擾，初居之南方人，終夜殊難以合眼。其他小旅舍，則爲趕驢夫及農民來城有事者之宿所，收費僅數大枚一宿，數人合臥一土坑，聊能横身伸足而已。　　此次事變居中指揮者，報載爲武垣。査武垣於數年前，曾常住上海，余與之有數面綠，其人字官亭，爲河北省之香河縣人，年約四旬，居滬時常住於華北公庽及愛多亞路之河北旅滬同鄕會內。聞武本爲香河富戶，因家產被毀於水，遂發憤提偶興修水利，著有水利叢書多種，如「京畿除水害興水利芻議」，「全國水利之建設」，「河北全省水之概算書」，水利唱本等，在滬大事贈送，並有全國水利協會之組織。武除提倡水利外，並著有「建國大綱講義」，「黨治省憲法草案一等書，書首均附有格言兩條，以述其志，一曰「拿興水利」事，敎全國人民，都認識革命的三民主義」一曰「拿三民主義革命，興起水利，解决全國民生問題」，其人似爲一讀書不多，頭腦簡單而思上進之人，兼以彼爲香河舊紳，易受鼓惑，遂成爲此次事變中之中心人物，良可慨也。　　致酬啟事　　觀亭，花鈴，寒，張恨水，秦瘦鷗，鄭逸梅，耘飧，新予，天虛我生，佩萸，楚玉，康健齋夫，秋郞，醉痴生，枕綠，孫麟昌，孫籌成，吉人，淸癯，火雪明，水鍔，拾玖，一震，永采，肖白，吳毓雋，顏波光，貢，海，吳雅非，叔範，馬剛，影呆，闌刪，惟經，爰梅，高吉安，跋芙孫，巴玲，征雁，朱慰萱，上海通社，黄連，田舍翁，憶秋，張孟昭，輝他，陳亮，鐵吾，特，葉奕頣，片月，醉樵，茱英，茸餘，馮摩尼，太玄，張慕良，乙孔，王瑜，秋子，朱　，玉明，劉芳棣，金綬錫，隱涓，劍凡，雪鴣，陳浩雄，江敉，王樂天，天基，德君，朱壽仁，丙丁，怡怡館主，南宮生，露華，心意，靑，藝生，（兒童週刋）森，佩瑜，文學，眞，甌陽古，敎書匠，張友鑑，子明，特、何公超，寗自强，禧，矜細，康健齋夫，閻重樓，李伯黍，漁艇，殷憶秋，陳亮，郭善霆，夏瀛，承明，胡錫山，花鈴，徐幹，紀一介，汪瘦秋，魏冰心，陸祖安，沈延英，曹梅瑛，闌刪，以德，君朋，火，秦慰儂，尤墨君，冰玉，玲，周賢，鐵吾，諸君鋻，十月份承惠腸天作，曷勝感紉，稿費業已結算淸楚，請　具條蓋章，向木館會計處領取爲荷。　　領酬章程　　本館發給酬資時間，於每月六日至十日止，冉於十六日至二十日止，除星期日外，每日下午兩點至四點，由本館會計處付給，請備條，加蓋與原稿相同圖章，逕向支取，若數月併取，亦須按月分別具條蓋章，以便粘附底冊，至蓋章一節，不　篇幅長短，或每月投稿次數多少，每篇均請蓋章，以便取酬時核對印鑑，如不蓋章，即作却酬論，再酬資以發表日起，六個月期滿，屆時仍有未來領者，認爲不願受酬，即行將賬取銷，以資結束。　　劉大，寓意，吉雲，顧雨時，涂筱巢，甲辰生，孫漱石，顏，陳叔平，（兒章週刊）程美紅，石，陳冉良，生凡，仁，王驥，惠琳，池卜音，志恒，　文煥，張健，影，諸君鑒，請即補寄圖章，並親筆來信以便核對爲荷。　　申報春秋編輯部啟</p>

<p>申報醫藥周刊介紹日本砂眼預防協會  陳任　　十九世紀的末年，二十世紀的初期，世界的先進國開始系統地有計劃地，從事於砂眼的撲滅工作，匈牙利於一八八六年倡導於先，德國普魯士於一八八九年繼起，自後各列強先後效法，舉國一臻，視砂眼如毒蛇猛獸，策謀撲滅，如臨大敵。　　世界砂眼分布最廣者，莫如埃及，貧窮階級竟有一百％，而上等階級亦有九十五％以上，可謂人人都有砂眼，西洋砂眼，西洋砂眼之別稱為埃及眼黑，即以此故，自二十世紀初年，也開始了偉大的撲滅預防工作，由一英國眼科專家麥克倫（Mac　Callan）主持之，至今數十年來，已成為全世界砂眼撲滅預防事業之模範。　　遠東之中國日本，砂眼分布之廣，固亦見稱於世。所以一談砂眼，立刻想及中國日本，亦無不卑視。然日本自一九一九年，政府發布砂眼預防法律後，全國致全力於此毒病之撲滅，至今十餘年來，成效卓著，每年之徵兵檢查，日見砂眼患率之减少。而世界各國，每談砂眼，對日本無不表敬意。反觀吾國，處處落後·砂眼之毒侵全國，許多壯年窮人·奪其生計，而減國力·今日中國之砂眼撲滅工作，實急不容緩，鄰國日本旣已實行於先，吾人對他國的採考，實爲必要·欲知日本之砂眼撲滅事業，不可不先知與日本砂眼共生死之日本砂眼預防協會，茲先介紹。　　砂眼之撲滅，為衛生事業之一·衛生是雙方的，一方是個人，又一方是社會的。社會衛生事業要用政治力量系統地有計劃地。從事撲滅預防之工作，所以社會的衛生事業，也可以說是衛生政策。這時必得有所謂先知先覺的分子，特別是我們醫生及社會知識的先進分子，對疾病之利害關係，完全洞穿，而以全力爲社會倡導，從事宣傳：一方灌輪民衆知識，促進衛生之講究。又一方引起當局者之注意，預防事業計劃之提出，而促其實施。在這偉大的意志下，日本砂眼預防協會，得於一九一五年在東京創立總會。　　（一）協會之實傳旨趣　　日本自維新以來，舉國一致，努力促進近代國家之造成。而砂眼預防之旨趣宣傳，亦全以國家爲最高的前提。三大原因爲他們宣傳的唯一口號第一，生產力之减少。因日本復興，必須人人工作，始能增國富。今因病而能力少，因失明而寄生，必妨礙國家之發展。第二，兵力之减少，日本國小，欲維持其國際之威位，全賴武力。兵而病眼，則其戰鬥力必臧，國力自疲。第三，國恥之觀念。美國排日，每以以本多砂眼，野蠻國之病患爲口實。日本被稱野蠻國，一最傷日本自尊之心，認爲莫大之恥辱，並因此移民被阻，而妨日本海外之發展。故日本對砂眼之撲滅，無不贊助，無不奮力服從之。於是砂眼預防法案之制定，砂眼調査局，施療病院之設立，講習會之開催，預防事業之宣傳，無不發達而稱於世，良有以也。　　（二）恊會之使命　　恊會的使命，非常明顯：就是集合社會的先知先覺分子，醫生，特別是眼科醫，爲一個共同理想而奮鬥，協會的最初事業，唯一在於促進政府之注意，而有系統的政策的實施。因會員不斷之努力，而有日本政府一九一九年之砂眼預防法之公布。雖然此法律之公布，固由協會之努力。然協會之使命，並非至此而止。在協會刋物中有云：「因會員對預防事業貢獻之努力，而得朝野諸氏之注意，本會深以爲欣幸。然吾人所期之目的前途，猶頗遼遠。旣往之事業，僅不過一小部分而已。自砂眼預防法發布後，吾人固未可大慶。而此法之充分運用，官民一致，舉全力以撲滅此毒，始得獲良好之成績」。　　在預防法公布之後，協會的事業，顯然轉入另一方面，卽切實地實施預防的工作：「政府當局的扶助，預防法完全之運用。在各方面砂眼之調査，檢診，治療預防事業乏計劃及實施，或各地砂眼預防團體之連絡，及支部之設置等。」　　（三）協會之經過重要事業　　協會於一九一五年於東京醫科大學法醫學敎室開催創立總會。再於次年四月開成立大會。入會之士，皆一時名流。在日本眼科之父河本博士領導之下，而從事於一偉大事業之開始。茲將歷年來重要功績略述如下：戒烟須知（五）  張仲明　　（五）安眠戒烟法　　係用大量安眠劑。使戒者常處於昏睡狀態中。致不發烟癮痛苦。而得達戒絕目的者。此種戒法。必須住院。在醫生嚴密監視下。方可舉行。大抵年輕身强者。或尙可支持。衰弱者。恐不免有一睡不醒之危險。故醫者多不敢嘗試。　　（六）注射戒烟法　　注射戒間法。係用一稱鈣素混合液。注入靜脈內。每日一次。一方面仍須服用戒烟藥品。俾漸達戒絕目的。此法始創於日本。邇來吾國新亞藥廠。亦能自製。各安的亞平。至注射法效用。與遞减法內　用之注射品。不過相彷彿而已。　　（七）硬戒法　　硬戒法多盛行於歐美。因歐美各國。服用鴉片嗎啡等麻醉品。（外人大都吞服打針。無吸食者。）卽爲犯罪。早已懸爲厲禁。故一旦發現。卽送入醫院勒戒其法使戒者入院　。全無麻醉藥品代用。只給以少數輔助藥品而已。　　按此法。經過時間甚短。約一星期許。卽可達戒絕目的。惟戒者痛苦異常。體弱　　者。每易發生不測。實危道也。　　第四章　禁斷現象　　禁斷現象。俗名發癮。卽烟量减少時。　完全减去時。發現種種不舒適之現象也。楚種現象。每隨各人環境，强弱，烟量，精神，年齡而不同。其最要症候。如筋骨酸痛，失眠，腹瀉，遺精，咳嗽，惡心嘔吐，心悸，忽冷忽熱，憤嚏流淚等。均有發生之可能。有數種症狀兼而有之者。有只發一二種者。五光十色。筆難盡述。又所發各種症候。輕重互異。有重於此而輕於彼者。有忽輕忽重者。總之禁斷現象之强弱。與烟量遞减成正比率。卽烟量愈少。禁斷現象愈强。但一旦烟癮完全脫離。則戒時一切不舒適之現象。復漸漸消失。而人生又返於未吸前之正軌狀態矣。是故禁斷現象。並未永久留存。只戒時偶發之診狀。此戒者所宜吿慰者也。　　醫者最大之目的。係能預防並制止各種禁斷現象發生。故第一須選擇輔助藥品。使與各人情形適合。以事預防。第二如果中途不適發生。則須臨時應變。以減少其痛苦。蓋禁斷現象之強弱。即戒烟成敗之關鍵。而醫者手段高明與否。亦可視其對付禁斷現象為何如也。　　第五章　戒烟時之修養　　在戒烟期內。每有强弱不等之禁斷現象發生。吾人旣已知之。故戒者除藥物治療外。還須於身心上特別注意。以利戒烟進行。　　（一）精神上之注意　　戒者宜淡泊安靜。凡一切悲惡驚懼之情感。務須使之遠避。平時可藉優美音樂。以陶冶其性情。或散步芳郊。以轉移其環攬。身心旣泰。戒烟亦當事半而功倍。　　（二）運動與工作之注意　　在戒烟期內。運動與工作。並非須絕對禁忌。但過勞工作。劇烈運動。仍以停止爲宜。　　（三）飲食之注意　　一切飲食物品。當與常人無異。不過刺激食品。如酒類，辣椒，生薑，胡椒之類。宜屏絕勿用。又糯食水菓。極易引起消化不良或洩瀉。故亦宜限制。　　（四）居室之注意　　居室以光綫充足空氣流通者爲佳。蓋吸者大都俾晝作夜。與陽光接觸甚少。又吞雲吐霧。吸入空氣不免混濁。故在戒烟時。宜力矯其弊。　　（五）衛生之注意　　衛生之道。本宜人人所奉行。而在戒烟期內。尤當再三致意。蓋一有疏忽。郎易發生疾病。致礙戒烟工作進行。　　結論　　信筆寫來。已覺不少。現在再作一總括之提要。　　（一）須有堅强之决心。　　（二）須經醫師之指導。　　（三）極靈騐而無毒之戒烟藥。至今尙待發明。　　（四）禁斷現象。爲戒期中不可避免之事實。須有忍耐心。　　（五）增加戒烟効率。惟有法令森嚴。　　吸老諸君乎。鴉片之害。盡人知乏。而君等身歷其境者。更能詳言細述。爲民族前途計。爲國家存亡計。使諸君不得不去其嗜好。故爲君等計算。與其貽悔於將來。曷若立志於今日。蓋戒烟雖非易事。如果意志堅强。無患不成。一旦烟癮滌盡。復作新民。其快樂當何如也。今日何日。今時何時。尙有閒情逸致嘯嗷烟霞之餘地耶。　（完）</p>

<p>各國最近之防癆陣綫（上）  丁惠康　　意大利及瑞士之三肺病保險　　意大利在一九二九年施行防癆保險章程，其第十章第二十七條云，凡屬薪水階級之人民，其年齡自十五歲至六十五歲，及其家屬，共有二千·六百萬人，幾及全意大利人口之半數，均應在保險施行條例之下履行其義務，其權利爲醫院治療醫生治療及疾病補助金之發給云。　　瑞士於一九二八年亦有肺病保險方法之施行，其條例及權利，與其他疾病保險方法相同，大約在保險後之每五年內，若罹肺病，得住院五百四十天也。　　診療所對於防癆訪求之改進　　最近各國對於防癆乏研究，均如努力，凡診療所不僅對於結核病者應加以注意，卽在某種之人，有結核症現象之嫌疑，而尙無主覺的及病的現象發生時，亦應施以診察，此種不發覺性之患者，　可於檢査時得之，卽一般實騐醫家，亦可送來也，此外如家庭問之治療，亦宜力行合作，俾消滅其傳染之發源地，實爲至要之舉，結核之新患者，每在病者之附近，如親屬朋友同居住者，同工作者，俱應時時施以檢査，而不可或忽。　　肺病之檢査，在某種年齡及時期內，如在靑春發育期間，或某種職業，如玻璃工作者之類，可舉行結隊檢査法。　　此外對於防癆最要之助力，爲學生時代之土白克林檢董法，雖在學校時期，其肺病尙無大患，但阿氏曾有六千七百八十八兒童之愛克司光檢査，發現四十五人患有活動新鮮性之兒童結核，其百分比例爲〇·六四％，以故在大學生中，亦應施以强迫檢査。　　總之，肺病之早期診斷，若能普及，則其治療結果愈形佳良，治療期亦可减少，而國家之生產力，亦因是而增高不少焉。牙齒常識問答（九）  林鑑賢　　（第四六問）　死的牙齒和活的牙齒，有什麽不同？　　（答）　死的牙齒，功用要遜色。因爲沒有感應，卽使受到傷害如蛀蝕等，也毫無知覺。而且牙質已死，彈性减少，不能像活的牙質般襯托牙磁，使牠堅固。　　（第四七問）　牙醫生說抽神經，是不是抽這牙髓嗎？　　（答）　抽神經就是抽除牙髓。因爲牙髓包含神經，所以普通就叫牠爲神經。　　（第四八問）　牙髓旣然很重要；應該保護，爲什麼有時反要抽去？　　（答）　齒髓在下列各種情形之下，應該抽去；　　（一）發炎腫脹，劇痛難堪，若此炎症無法消退時。（二）已經壞死（這時候應該立卽抽去）。（三）爲裝鑲牙齒起見，不得已要打穿髓室時，牙髓應該先行抽去。　　（第四九問）　牙髓牙質牙磁，和年齡有什麽關係？　　（答）　小孩的乳牙牙質牙磁都很薄，髓室蒼大，牙髓也大。少年人的永久牙，牙質牙磁都較厚些，髓室和牙髓也較小。年紀越高，髓室和牙髓越小；有些高年人的牙齒，牙髓甚至於無，差不多變爲實心的。　　（第五十問）　牙齒除了牙磁牙質牙髓這三層主要部分外，還有其他部分嗎？　　（答）　還有水門汀質（卽白堊質）和牙根膜兩種。疾病常識問答  程瀚章　　（七十二）肝臟梅毒　　（問）什麼叫做肝臟梅毒？　　（答）這是梅毒的病變，發生在肝臟實質內而致肝細胞破壞，全體萎縮的疾病。　　（問）肝臟梅毒的發生，在生後傳染的呢，還楚生前就受遺傳的呢？　　（答）不論後天性或先天性都得發生。　　（問）先天性的肝臟梅毒，在肝臟本質起怎樣變化？　　（答）先天性肝臟梅毒，有汎發性或限局性小細胞浸潤和結締織繁殖，肝臟肥大硬固，有時起新生結締織萎縮，肝細胞破壞，肝臟縮小，表面生凹凸。　　（問）後天性的肝臟梅毒，在肝本質起怎樣變化？　　（答）後天性性肝臟梅毒，大槪在梅毒第三期發生，起梅毒性肝間質炎或肝臟梅毒腫的象徵。肝臟硬化，生粟粒大小或核桃大小的膠皮腫，於是肝表面凹凸不平。　　（問）肝臟梅毒的病人，身體起什麼病狀？　　（答）若是病變限局於肝臟一部的時候，有時在不很重要的位置，臨症上不現什麼病狀。若膠皮腫壓迫門脈，便要起腹水脾腫，上腹靜脈怒張，胃腸出血；若壓迫輸膽管，就要發生黄疸。　　（問）梅毒性膠反腫初起的時候，在肝臟部起什麽現象？　　（答）這時候在肝臟的表面或邊緣，存有柔軟的球狀隆起物；其格膠皮腫吸收，生成凹溝，其質硬固，把肝臟分成多葉。肝表面凹凸不平。　　（問）病人在這時候自覺怎樣？　　（答）自覺該部有壓痛。　　（問）身體有無發熱？　　（答）有起弛張性或消耗性的發熱。　　（問）在這樣情形之下容易和那一種相誤混　　（答）容易和肝臟膿瘍相混誤。　　（問）怎樣診斷　種肝臟梅毒？　　（答）只要注意於肝臟的變化，和疼痛，腹水，脾腫和其他的梅毒性變化，或檢査血液，有無華氏反應等。　　（問）和普通的肝硬變症，是怎樣區別的？　　（答）可由病人的旣往症，大顆粒性，經過緩慢，養的比較作良等，就得區別。　　（問）　臟梅毒的預後吉凶如何？　　（答）預後兇惡。但若能早期施行驅梅療法，却有挽救的餘地，不能算是絕對不良　　（問）怎樣治療。種疾病？　　（答）洗　行　梅　法外，別無他法。止痛的醫學（四〇）  李興　　一八四六年摩氏曾在麻沙秋色士的聞名公立醫院表演以脫蒙藥用於開刀病人大見成效。糜爾頓氏於同年也得了工商部特等獎狀。因他獨享發明人的令譽也引起了很多的爭執，結果自己感受了精神上的痛苦後來他也由中風而死。傑克生後來也瘋狂了，此爲求人類幸福犧牲自己的一塲慘劇。　　由此時起蒙藥之實用一日千里全世風行。一八四七年有一位名富樂仁的用哥羅芳迷蒙動物，同年英國愛丁堡的辛卜生用哥羅芳於人身於是哥羅芳也成了蒙藥。次年富樂仁又提議用綠化二烷Etbyl　Chloride爲蒙藥。此爲初期蔆藥發明的經過。一九二三年又有人發見二炭烯Ethylene此氣爲蒙藥中之最優者。自從有了蒙藥在前不治的病可以割治毫無痛苦，外科上起死回生視爲常事。我們現在當感醫學前輩苦心研究的功勞，我們也當感化學家先爲醫學家做的基礎工作。　　蒙藥的變通作用　　現在用的蒙藥有兩種，一種是氣體，一種是液體，液體蒙藥係速揮發性化合物。液體必須先化成汽體然後才能被吸入肺內。蒙藥一吸到肺內就被肺內循環的血液吸收，後流到全身，帶到腦中與神經細胞起作用。經作用後大腦受麻木，初如睡狀，漸次迷蒙加深知覺感覺完全喪失。此時施行外科手術病人完全無知覺。蒙藥可施行數小時之久與身並無特別妨害。停加蒙藥後身內與神經細胞內的蒙藥漸回入血液，再由血液入肺漸漸揮發離身，病人神志也漸恢復原狀　　蒙藥之初期實用時經外科手術的病人多是戰戰兢兢非常恐懼，在用蔆藥前被嚇死的也時有所聞。近數十年來蔆藥普徧使用，病人對於蒙藥漸少投懼，對於外科手術也沒有從前那樣懼怕。在施行蔆藥前若給病人注射少許麻醉品以麻木其神經可除去病人懼怕心理。此爲麻醉品的正當用途。除去痛苦除去畏懼，施行各種外科手術盡醫學之　事，挽救垂死的病人，科學醫之有功於人類不能算不大。　　以脫爲最先發見的蒙藥，共作用較。何　蒙藥爲安全。使用最易，安全界限最寬，節制多少　易，一見危險立卽可以停加蒙藥，病人轉危爲安並不艱難。其優於注射蒙藥的卽在此。注射蒙藥過量卽無法挽救。以脫對於身體也無大害。用以脫將近百年，現在仍佔蒙藥中的重要位置。　　一養化淡（笑氣）發現較以脫為早普徧實用較以脫在後。此氣氣味較以脫好；病人被蒙時並不感受痛苦。以股氣味較難忍受。一養化淡氣迷蒙作用來的快去的也快，且去後也無痛苦。用於大小開刀均無不可但時間不宜過長。用一養化淡氣於產婦臨盆時止痛也算是婦女的救星。患心臟病的與血壓高的不宜用因此氣增高血壓。肺結核淺說（七四）  胡嘉言　　第三節　病者之精神修養　　那末，所謂精神修養也者，應該從何處著手呢？第一：病者應該徹底明白，肺結核是一種可痊愈的病症。因爲肺結核沒有特效藥，卽目爲不治之症，這是完全錯誤的。如果說：肺結核患老是狠多陷於死亡的；這在一切急性傳染病，胃腸病，神經衰弱症，固無不如是的；甚至尋常的感冒症也有不治者；但這種種病病症決不是不會痊愈的！患者如果明瞭這種理由，對於痊愈的希望和信念，方能不折不撓，不爲其他諸說所威脅的。復次，對於有學識富熱誠的醫者，應該萬分信賴，唯命楚聽的。醫者與患者雙方，其精神互相一致，然後始能恊力以征服此慢性之敵人，使病症漸趨於治愈之目的的。　　患者對於痊愈的希望和信念，如何方不致搖動呢？除開上述的外，患者須有忍耐笥，第二須具有充分堅強之意志。我們曉得，肺結核症除開少數的例外外，大半是慢性型式，時發時愈的：所以痊愈究竟需要多少時間，誰也回答不出，就是診治的醫　也是一樣的：像這樣的矌日持久，遙遙無期，當然會引起身受者精神上之不安靜，對前途充滿悲哀色采的。對付這種頑强的慢性敵人，只有長期忍耐，苦思焦慮，於病症是有無利的。至患者之能忍耐與否，首須有充分堅強之意志方行，否則總不免屈服於習慣和誘惑的。患者有了堅強的意志，方能有戰勝慢性病患之大原願，並且是百折不撓，決不至受病患之支配；。—患者假使有這種精神，那末，所謂肉體和精神同須休養一層，當然是辦到不難了！消息中華醫學會第十一屆大會紀聞　　中華醫學會此次乘廣州博　醫院舉行創立百週年紀念，及總理開始學醫及作革命運動五十年紀念，逸仙醫學院奠基典禮之便，在廣州舉行第十一屆，卽合併後第三屆大會，報名參加者，原僅二百六十餘人，迨本月一日登記時，報到會員驟增一百餘人，截至五日上午，報到會員達四百五十五人，就中外籍會員約佔四分之一，國籍以英，美，德，日，法爲多，餘均爲本國籍會員（按該會有會員二千零九十三人，此次出席者尙僅佔四分之一）。大會於四日上午正式開幕，由主席林宗楊致開會詞，敎育部王部長代表朱章賡，廣東林省主席代表金曾澄，廣州劉市長代表何熾昌，廣州市衛生局局長鄧眞德等致訓詞，中華民國醫藥學會代表陶熾孫，中華全國醫師聯合會代表金問淇等致頌詞，並由總秘書朱恒璧宣讀衛生署，中央醫院，中央大學醫學院，香港大學，英國醫學會，美國醫學會，南京，香港等各地中華醫學會支會賀電數十通，並報吿一年半以來之會務。繼由會計及編輯馬雅各，余雲岫等作會計及編輯報吿，幷推舉許剛良及薛雲宣爲本屆大會中英文秘書，然後散會。下午開內科，外科，眼耳鼻喉科，生理學分組會議，討諭詳情，容另行探誌。五日上午改選職員，結果，推劉瑞恒，林可勝，牛惠霖，刁信德，林宗揚，胡惠德，馬理斯爲監察委員會委員，顏福慶，伍連德，蘭安生，胡美，李樹芬，劉劍秋爲董事部董事，朱恒璧爲主席，金賣善，嘉惠霖爲副主席，牛惠生爲總秘書，方嘉成爲會計，許雨階，馬雅各，余巖爲編輯，牛惠生，方嘉成，馬雅各，莫約西，翁之龍，蘇達立爲理事會理事，黄子方，李廷安等公共衛生委員會委員，戚壽南，朱章賡，顏一福慶等爲醫學敎育委員會委員，宋國賓，胡定安，陶熾孫等爲業務保障委員會委員，沈克非，王德光，王鍚熾等爲醫院標準委員會委員，吳憲，江淸，于光元等爲研究委員會委員，張霽，侯寶璋，余　等爲出版委員會委員，貝德巽，馬雅各，伊文思等爲敎會醫事委員會委員，陳宗賢，伊博恩，朱恒璧等爲藥物化學委員會委員，下午開婦產科，病理學及公共衛生分組會議，聞大會全程八日，須至八日完畢，九日並將續開第二次中國麻風會議云。徵求本刋　　茲徵求申報醫藥週刋念三年十二月二十一日一〇五期一份，如蒙讀者割讓，當以康健雜誌及創作小說爲酬，請函本埠南市九畝地開明里四十七號郭賢文接洽，如不欲以書箱　換者，則請開明代價。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言蝗蟲背上的「W」  夢若　　我國最有名的預言家爲劉伯溫，據說他所作的預言，事過後無一不中。這是否可信，我們不敢說。我們惟覺得他的話，都是非科學的。所謂應騐，無非是一輩好事者的牽强附會。我們一加檢視，便會大笑三天。然而劉伯溫不但中國有，外國也有。而且外國劉伯溫的預言，往往比中國劉伯溫還要武斷。近來時聞一二外國預言家，像煞有價事的，或說某年某月某日，某國某要人要遭暗殺，或謂經過若干時日，某地會發生大火或水災，像連什麽時侯雷公要劈死蜈蚣精，都可以預料似的。若問他們何所據而云然？除吿訴你因爲某夜看見彗星從天南墮地以外，便是天機不可洩漏。　　現在又有一位外國人，因爲發見蝗蟲背上有一英文字母，而預料世界戰爭卽將爆發。這人爲美國美西戰爭老軍人，名叫愛德華毛利司，現住沃克拉霍瑪州白列斯登做寓公。其預言所持理由，爲當地農村中，近忽發見蝗蟲，其背上皆顯有天然生成的英文「W」字母，卽爲（War）一字的縮寫。他說他在美西戰爭與歐戰之前，均曾見蝗蟲背上有同樣的顯現。又謂倘僅有一個「W」字，尙不甚惡。不幸在字形之下，有一小　，這乃表示戰爭將　及全世界。　　這位戰爭老人的預言，實在同我國的拆字先生一樣聰明。蝗蟲背上會不會現出字母，這已是一個疑問。就算這奇事是實有的，英字用「W」起首的，何只幾百個，怎能斷定這個「W」卽爲戰爭（War）一字的縮寫？然而我們要指這位預言老人是瞎說，也不公道。因爲他在美西戰爭與歐戰之前，均有經騐過。　　不過他預斷世界戰爭卽將爆發，這話却是很不錯的。可惜他老經戰爭。要看戰爭是否會發生，不從世界形勢去觀察，而從蝗蟲身上去問卜，這舉動未免過於愚笨。吿訴你，目前各國在拚命的整軍經武，這不是為的戰爭是什麼？這證據比之蝗蟲背上的字母，可靠得多。獨弦歌者  勞心　　這幾天傍晚上跑到馬路上來的時候都遇到見他，一個年紀已經很老了的獨弦歌者。他的頭髮已經斑白的了，瘦癯得象一根柴枝一樣，臉部的表情常常是沈默而憂鬱的，绷得緊緊地，筋肉都象要抽搐起來似的。他並沒有任何的修飾，一切文明物品都與他無緣，身上老是那一件破碎得釘滿了補釘的長袍子，問什着一些斑駁的油膩痕跡。衣服很單薄，雖然是這樣並不寒冷的秋風，也把牠吹得抖索；他，也許是年老的關係，站在秋風里，是那副寒傖而又使人可憐的臉相。他靠着了來吃飯的，大槪是他懷里的一個破壞了的胡琴了。那胡琴是三弦的，可是在他手里已經變成了獨弦，其餘的兩根大槪是斷了，而又沒錢支配的緣故，空在頭上剩了兩個洞。不過，他拉了起來，那弓還很活潑，而且善於利用</p>

<p>他的左手的三根指頭，很純熱地在「走綫」，從最低音直到最高音。　　當我碰到了他時，也因爲我本來便是沒有什麼事而閒在馬路上的失業人，所以老是站在那里看他弄那純熟的獨弦。不知是不是爲了他的身世可憐的關係，他彈出來的調子，都是那樣地帶着重濁而憂鬱的音調，很象在替他自己訴述着那困苦不過的生活似的。本來我和他是同感，不過我還是靑年人，我還有着倔强的脾氣，並沒有像他的調子所象徵的都是黑暗的一樣。他彈了一會了，那駝着的背抽搐了幾下，跟着便是停了那拉動着弓的手，劇烈地嗆咳着，在吐下了一塊黑而硬的痰塊之後，便把兩手一掬，向着那些圍着他在聽的行人們討銅板。他沒有作聲，他只把臉孔的表情來代替他的言語。但是，行人們也許是專意地跟他過不去，不是趁着熱鬧溜之大吉的，　是站在那里動也不動。　　他的眼睛落在我的身上了。我慚愧，我不知道我應該怎樣來回答他的這無聲之語。因爲我並不是可以可憐別人的人，我沒有這伽資格，如果我的袋子在那個時候是有上幾個銅板的話，一碗由芋便是我最好的晚餐了。同樣地，我用一種畏縮而又害怕的熊度，遊開了他的眼光。跟着他便嘆了一口氣，用一種稍帶有憤怒的眼光，在行人們迅速地瞥了一下，便又拖着了一種怪可憐的步伐走了。我知道，他這時候心里一定很難過，而且也許他在埋怨甚至詛咒這世界，這人類，無可躲避的我是被埋怨或被詛咒的一個！但是，那有什麽辦法哩？我們大家的痛苦，還是讓自家兒知道吧。　　我在送走着他的背影的時候，也許我的心里比他更難過的。因爲，從他那個胡琴看來，他是一個有過很好的命運的人，相信他在年靑的時候是曾經過着雖不十分寬裕而也可以說得上是安定的生活的。但是，殘酷的時間已經再不可以留着一個人的幸福了，也許他便是這樣的一個被淘汰者。時間把他一切都葬送了，只讓他孤獨地嘗試悲哀。正如他的胡琴一樣，只好讓他殘缺地獨弦了，他再沒有補上去的自由和權利。　　他站定了時，我便再次地趕上去，因爲我愛聽他的無音的歌聲。但是這一次的命運比之上一次更糟了，他不特不能用他的純熟的調子去換取別人的同情，反之却得到了更多的冷漠。在我親眼看見的便是一些給認作紳士之一類的文明而有着漂亮的修飾的靑年人，在漂亮地駡上兩句地走了。在這樣的一個很容易會挑起了我的「野蠻」脾氣的機會里，我迅速地掩上了臉走了，因爲我再不能看這樣的一幕慘酷的悲劇。　　幾天來我沒有碰見這個獨弦歌者了，爲了要找飯吃的事情。但是，我心里還是牢牢地記着他，當我閉上了眼睛時，便彷彿地看見了這樣的一個寒傖而又沈默的年紀老了的獨弦歌者，他又向我投視着那帶着埋怨的眼光，於楚我害怕了，我瞪開了眼睛。可是一會兒那凄涼的無音的調子又吹進了耳朶了，像一根很鋒利的小刀，一直戳到了我的心坎里，於是我又得掩上了我的耳朶。但是我並沒有忘記了他，噹我跑到了馬路上來時，我還是在人叢中尋找着他。可是這都是幻想，我再不可以找到他了。　　時間又過了很久，我爲了借錢借不到而又再不可以不吃飯時，我去賣舊報紙了。一大綑舊報紙在舊貨攤里換四角和二十三個銅子兒。這時候我忽然在很多舊貨堆里發見了那個我天天在記懷着的獨弦歌者的胡琴，我心里在起着抽搐，我明白了這幾天爲什麼找不到他的原故，也許以後也永遠找不到。於是我走了，不敢再看那胡琴一次。深秋  曼　　妹妹像一頭燕子似的從門外掠進來，把紙包往床上一摔，一龔新製的旗袍她乘勢提在手里，！邊覆在身上比了比式樣，跳到穿衣鏡前穿著起來。　　「姐姐，大紅不是更漂亮嗎？我是歡喜是大紅的！」旋過身來背對着姐姐，「腰身大嗎，姐姐？」　　姐姐坐在沙發椅里，悠閑地抽着烟捲。她穿着黑色的旗袍，顯露很大方。妹妹買那襲大紅色衣料的時候，她曾竭力反對，說那不是一個紅爆仗嗎？年紀輕的，就喜歡大紅大綠，叫人家看在眼里不舒服。　　「腰身火嗎？」姐姐還是不高興，「做得像竹管箇一樣，走起路來才叫人肉麻呢！」　　妹妹吐了吐舌頭，故意一扭一擺走到後房去。姐姐看在眼里，幾乎想笑出來，但是她做做瞧着壁上的照像。那像片是她六年前照的，側着頭，一付頑皮的面孔，和現在的妹妹　樣。那襲衣　也是大紅的，她記得里子也是大紅的，那個時候，她幾乎每天穿着大紅的衣服。但是僅僅過了六年，一切都改變過來，她所喜歡的紅色已經叫人看在眼里不舒服。「時間直是個奇怪的東西啊！」姐姐想着從沙發上站起來，慢慢地走到穿衣鏡前，看着自己憔悴的影子，自己駁斥了：　　「不是，年紀才是個奇怪的東西呢！」　　下面高聲喊着叫條子了。妹妹從後房應聲出來，走路還是扭着擺着。在白熱的燈光下，她是那樣年輕，那樣燦爛，一個年里人應該尊貴着自己的靑春呢！　　她見姐姐呆呆地站在那里，跳到姐姐面前，雙手扳着姐姐的肩胛問：「姐姐不舒服嗎？」　　「不，我想着我那件大紅的衣服不知擱在號口箱子里。」　　「姐姐也穿號件大紅的旗袍？那我們才是一哩。我來替你找，總在這四口箱子里的。」　　妹妹高興地想跳到後房去，但是被姐姐拉住了。　　「時候不早了，我們走罷。換起來要費大半天功夫呢。」　　「那末，妹妹終覺得不穿紅衣服是可怖的，「那末，明天穿罷，今晚上我替你找出來。」　　她們不是親生的姐妹倆，是一對墮落在風塵牛的可憐虫。姐姐是抖過一時的紅倌人，鴇母仗着她爲搖錢樹，她自巴　　　着年輕，　　那些王孫公子　纖的掌握之中。但是她的靑春是那樣地浪費了，時間是個奇怪的東西啊！琵琶門巷漸漸地冷落起來，她也不再受鴇母的寵愛，於是她的妹妹二個和她同命運的可憐虫）替代了她昔日的光榮，年紀才是個奇怪的東西呢！　　坐上水電燈的包車，她彷彿被人扣上了銷鏈，由車夫拉着她進黑暗的地獄。明亮的街燈，嘈雜的人聲，在她眼前耳邊糢糊過去。她抱着妹妹的腰，偸偸地下淚了。但是踏進了大飯店的門口，她不得不裝起笑臉來，那些野性的人們底企求，她是知道的：他們要挑撻，要媚笑：而自己就貨品一般地任他們選擇一，玩弄。她看着妹妹的紅色旗袍在燈光下打轉，一個輕汽球那樣地，遲早要判决了她的命運。　　由這家大飯店轉到那家大飯店，回來已是午夜了。途上靜悄悄地彷彿轉入另一個世界，寒風刺骨地侵襲着地單薄的衣衫，她打了個寒嘩。　　「又是一天了啊！」她默唸着。　　回到家里，她不由地望着那張六年前的像片，她夜哭。　　妹妹忙着卸裝，她把那襲新製的旗袍親自折疊，放進衣櫉里，疲乏地倒在沙發上了。姐姐還在端詳着那張像片，她忽然夜起替姐姐找紅衣服，翻身起來，拉着姐姐的手說：「找那件旗袍去。」　　「明天找吧，妹妹，我有點頭痛，想睡了。」　　「天氣太冷了！」妹妹搓着手，「吐顆阿斯匹斯睡罷，衣服我來替你找。」　　　是幹，秩深了　　你也早　　吧。　　「我不怕冷！」妹妹挺了挺腰肢，像一個好漢。　　「不要找了，那件旗袍是夾的，過了時啊！　　「姐姐眞是老了，這夭氣不能穿夾旗袍嗎？我們兩個都穿紅旗袍，不是很好嗎？」　　「冬天快到了，也該珍惜自己的身體！」姐姐旋過身去，兩顆晶瑩的淚珠終於掛了下來。悲劇  雅非　　阿咪生了孩子，是四個，而且恰巧生在二叔的老家堂底下。生了四個已經够使二叔生恨——四個都是槓棺材的——何况還生在老家堂底下呢？那一定是個不祥兆頭，簡直楚要叫合家倒霉；今年一年人口準不會順利了。於是他對這四個無辜的小小生命，也開始起了仇視。　　「斷命貓！你和我前世是什麽寃家」？他用竹竿揍着牠，惡狠狠的駡着：阿咪却並沒有明白自己究竟有了什麽過失，會突然地遭受牠主人的譴責，只睜着一對碧綠的眼珠，灼灼閃光的對他瞪着。牠擋不住那武力的襲擊，終於在一天的晚上搬了家，將幾個孩子全藏了起來　　「快去丟了牠們吧，趁牠們還沒開眼，開了眼丟是罪過的。」二嬸娘對二叔說：二叔正想去把牠們丟掉，但是發現產房裏的孩子完全不見了。他找了許多地方，草堆，柴間，尋了個遍，都沒有踪影。　　這天嚮午，阿咪曳着了個瘦癟的身體，懶洋洋地走了出來，看看自己的碗裏還空着，——他們沒有給牠像往日一</p>
<p>Page 19</p>
<p>樣的放着有小鮮骨頭的飯在那隻破碗裏，牠失望地對二叔他們望望。　　「你這沒有義氣的東西，我們還要來喂你呀！」二嬸娘對牠瞥了一眼，恨恨地駡。　　那孩子們在窠裏找不到了母親，便嗚鳴的喊了起來。坐在門限上的二叔頓時發現了什麽似的，倏地站起來，從扶梯上爬到了擱上，在稻草堆裏東一抄，西一翻的找尋，最後畢竟給他發現了四頭沒有開眼的小花貓擠在一個稻草的隙鏬裏，蠕蠕地爬動；眞不知什麼念頭在支使他，他顫抖地將四頭剛生了三天的嬰兒捉進一隻破籃裏，戰戰兢兢的走到一條小石橋上，他揭開了籃來，「噗咚」一聲，把四條無辜的小生命投到僑底下，水面一陣激動，漾出了幾個水淌兒：接者那四頭小貓也拚命的在水面上划了一陣，可見沒有叫。二叔已沒有勇氣對這水裏望一下，掉頭就向家裏跑去，一顆心是緊縮着，好像做了一次違心的，不可吿人的事情，然而同時心裏也像幹掉了一件大事般的輕鬆了。　　回到家裏，阿咪嘶聲地狂叫着，非常哀惋悽楚，牠東呀西呀的找，到了晚上，他史其叫得厲害了，牠沒有吃飯，第二天還是不吃飯，儘一處又一處的找，叫，……播音歌曲介紹　　給夜鶯　　今日下午十時半至十一時半由夜　藝社露茜小姐在交通部電台唱出　　夜鶯，你歌聲是這樣地婉曼輕盈；夜鶯，你歌聲是這樣地淸麗動人；呵！詩人爲你而陶醉，呵！戀人更抱擁輕狂！但是請你低頭看看這地獄下的罪人，，黑暗痛苦深！衣不暖，食不飽，悲慘的生活誰知道？誰知道？夜鶯！請你爲他們呀，發出些被迫得反抗的吼聲！鼓勵那頽喪自殺，徘徊歧途的靑年；斬辣披荊，携手前進！夜鶯，你歌聲要悲壯，要有力，要振奮！夜鶯，你歌聲要這樣地莊嚴動人！呵！請莫專讚美那幽谷的琴泉；請莫呀，專歡唱那天上的明月。特別節目　　夜鶯藝社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午十時半至十一時半　　夜鶯曲　（前奏曲）　　農村之歌　（曼娜）　　風雨　舟　（秦茵）　　給夜鶯　（露茜）　　船家曲　（流朗）　　楊子江暴風雨　（曼娜）　　我不能忘記你　（秦茵）　　新光明之路　（露茜）　　維特與紙蒂　（流朗）　　聶耳輓歌　（曼娜）歌唱　　上海歌劇社　　大中華（一一六〇）下午六時七時　　花心曲　（周璇）　　長記得　（徐健）　　去年的我　（秋影）　　太平花　（周潔）　　擱樓上小妲　（秋影）</p>

<p>— Star</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian War, the attitude of the United States has led the League of Nations to exercise caution in imposing sanctions. Recently, the Emperor of Abyssinia telegraphed to the United States requesting assistance from the League of Nations and urging it to join the sanctions, stating that this is the time for the United States to exert its efforts for peace. U.S. Secretary of State Hull also delivered a broadcast speech, stating that the United States' position in the current Italo-Abyssinian War is not only to maintain neutrality, but also to take a further step to assist countries in promoting a peaceful resolution of the dispute. The diplomatic policy of the United States seeks not only to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool of war, but also to make efforts for peace.</p>
<p>We cannot doubt the sincerity of Hull's words. Since taking office as Secretary of State, he has consistently advocated international cooperation. He has consistently advocated reducing tariffs, stabilizing currencies, promoting neighborly policies, and eliminating militarism. However, what we question today is how Hull will be able to realize his claims, how he will be able to prevent the United States from being drawn into the whirlpool, and still be able to work for international peace. The diplomatic power of the United States government is not concentrated in the President, and Congress's distrust of the President often leads to the establishment of extremely strict laws that force the President to abide by them, thus preventing the President from having the opportunity and ability to dedicate himself to world peace. The Neutrality Act is a clear example.</p>
<p>The U.S. Congress is currently in recess. The Neutrality Act passed on August 29 has deprived the President of the power to cooperate with the League of Nations to sanction Italy. The Neutrality Act does not allow the President to show any partiality to either Italy or Abyssinia. If the export of military supplies is prohibited to Italy, it must also be prohibited to Abyssinia. If it is unfavorable to one side, the President would be violating the law. Moreover, according to the current form of the act, the prohibition of the export of military supplies does not extend to copper, cotton, gasoline, etc., causing the League of Nations to prohibit the supply of raw materials to Italy, while the United States continues to supply oil, copper, cotton, iron, and other war necessities to Italy. As a result, sanctions are bound to fail, and if the League of Nations interferes, it is bound to cause conflict between Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>We believe that wise American politicians should know that the Italo-Abyssinian issue is not a local matter, but a matter for the whole world. If the United States insists on its policy of neutrality and treats Italy and Abyssinia equally in form, it is actually supporting Italy because Italy's needs from the United States are so great. If something happens elsewhere in the world one day and the United States joins the war, it will be difficult for the United States to ask other countries for help in maintaining collective peace. Hull and others are deeply aware of these relationships. Therefore, they actively opposed the Neutrality Act passed by Congress. The next Congress should seek to amend the Neutrality Act to give the President greater power to prevent war before it happens. The situation in the Far East is very urgent, and the United States is undoubtedly the main player in this area. We sincerely hope that the leaders of that country will realize as soon as possible that the collective peace in the Far East should be maintained in the same way as the collective peace in Europe. To ensure that the United States is never drawn into the war, the best way is to prevent war from happening in the world. If the Italo-Abyssinian War expands into a war between the League of Nations and Italy, it is bound to expand into a war between the world's aggressor countries and the world's peace-loving countries. Who intends to invade and who hopes for peace is obvious. To prevent a great upheaval before it happens, the United States cannot abandon its responsibility.</p>

<p>(London) Well-informed sources stated today that Britain has not had any discussions on lending money to China since the failure of the plan in mid-March of this year.

<h3 id="e16">After the Fall of Magal, the Focus of the War Shifts West; The Italian Army Advances Towards Harar in the South, While the Northern Army Solidifies Positions and Plans an Attack <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Following the occupation of Magal by the Italian army on Friday, the northern Italian forces are now advancing southwards along the main road to Aksum, towards the heights of Solicote. However, the advance of the Italian forces in this area has reached its limit, and the focus of the war has now shifted to the west. There, the Italian army is about to launch an offensive south of the Setit River, aiming to eliminate the salient in the Italian line at the Danping Plateau. The Ethiopian general, Westium, is still defending the plateau with a large army, but is expected to retreat without a fight. At the same time, the advance of the Italian army is being hampered by heavy rains. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian army's position in the south is now only 200 kilometers from the city of Harar. It is generally believed that General Graziani will launch a strong offensive against Harar in the short term. Currently, the Italian army has penetrated 300 kilometers into the Somaliland front in the south. General Graziani's strategy is to first bombard Ethiopian positions with heavy air raids, and then use native "Duba Mobile Units" and Ethiopian rebel troops to form a column to advance. In addition, the natural roads in the Walgaaden area and the roads previously built by the Ethiopian army are greatly facilitating the Italian advance. As for the Italian army in the north, it appears to be strengthening its existing positions to make them more secure, but its front line will be temporarily limited to pushing to the Taigas River in order to encircle the Donbian region, as a large number of Ethiopian troops under General Sai Xiong are concentrated there. The reason why the Italian army has not yet taken action in the Donbian region is that the roads there are winding and conducive to ambushes. For the sake of caution, the Italian army has not yet launched an offensive in that direction. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Harar The Ethiopian Command announced today that it has acknowledged that the Italian army has occupied Golahei, and stated that the Italian army had bombed the area from both land and air for a week before the occupation. The Ethiopian army also fought bravely, but suffered heavy losses under the onslaught of tanks and armored vehicles. General Afei Wowke also died in battle. The Ethiopian army has now retreated to Qiqiqa, and order is being maintained. (Kokumin, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Judging from the current situation, the extent and speed of the Italian army's occupation of Ethiopian territory seem to be limited only by the patience of the Italian generals. In the past month, the Italian army has occupied one-eighth of the entire territory of Ethiopia, a total of 25,000 square miles, without a single major engagement. The Italian army relies entirely on aerial bombardment and is invincible. Although the Ethiopian army has repeatedly claimed that there will be major battles at Aduwa and Magal, these have not materialized and have been easily seized by the Italian army. Now, they are advancing directly towards Amba Alagi, apparently without encountering resistance. On the one hand, the Italian army has also advanced towards the strategic city of Gonda in the Lake Tana area. Currently, Britain is unable to respond hastily due to the general election scheduled for November 12th. The Italian army is taking advantage of this opportunity. Once the British government obtains the consent of the people to continue its current hard-line policy, it is feared that the Italian army will have control of the Lake Tana area and the water source for irrigating Egypt and Sudan.

<p>Tigray Front This is a dispatch from our correspondent Bart accompanying the army. After the Italian army's successful offensive in the north, its southern forces have also occupied the town of Sasabini (the town is less than 200 kilometers from Qiqiqa, and the road from the Ethiopian capital to the British port of Berberah passes through it). From there, it will not be difficult to take the entire Walgaaden area in one fell swoop. As for the north, the Italian army has already captured the highlands south of Magal, which overlook the areas of Antalo and Seligo. However, the left-wing army has temporarily halted its advance to replenish supplies and repair roads, and is deploying defenses between the cities of Magal and Antalo. It seems that only General Maravigna's army will continue to advance. As for the native troops in the Donake area, they are stationed near the Berket area east of the city of Agula, as this is where the Italian army's left wing has stationed native troops to prevent the Ethiopian army from attempting to encircle them. In addition, the important positions in the Setit River basin in the northwest are still in the hands of the Ethiopian army. The two sides are only engaging in minor skirmishes every day, and there are no large-scale battles. Italian aircraft are currently conducting reconnaissance over Manga, Seligo, and Antalo, and have found that the areas are extremely peaceful, and the farmers are still cultivating as usual. Only in the Agae area of Manga Baba did the people of the village of Ejgaye fire on Italian aircraft. In addition, Italian aircraft can land very easily in the city of Magal, so it will not be difficult to quickly set up an airfield there. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Tigray Front This is a dispatch from our correspondent Bart accompanying the army. Since the Italian army occupied the city of Magal, it is scheduled to hold religious ceremonies today and tomorrow, which will be of the same nature as those held when the city of Aduwa was occupied. The surrendered general, Guksas, and the local people will participate. General Taibono, the High Commissioner of East Africa, will also personally attend and receive the surrender of the local church and community leaders. Duke Bergamo, the nephew of the Italian King, is scheduled to inspect the "Gransasu Division" tomorrow. General Sandini recently made a statement to reporters, saying that the Italian army did not advance along the main road this time, as it wanted to leave space for the rear to transport supplies. He also said that this is the first time that tanks have been used in colonial warfare, and that the local people along the way have warmly welcomed the Italian army. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Since the Italian army captured the city of Magal, it is generally believed that the Italian authorities are currently considering building a railway or digging a canal between the city of Magal and the Red Sea to facilitate transportation. If a canal is dug, it will directly reach the salt-producing area near the city of Marmal, which can be turned into a salt sea. It is estimated that this canal project will take nine months to complete. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Upholding Commitments to the World; British Policy Fully Supported by the Empire; Sincere Cooperation with Egypt Without Selfish Interests</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hall delivered a lengthy speech last night at the Lord Mayor of London's annual banquet, recounting the events of the year and clarifying that the British people are determined to abide by their commitments to Europe and the world. The British people are determined to participate in any noble attempt to end the Ethiopian war.</p>
<p>Among those attending the banquet were representatives from the administrative, religious, social, and commercial sectors. However, Prime Minister Baldwin was unable to attend due to official business. At the beginning of his speech, the Foreign Secretary stated that the loyalty of the citizens of London and their enthusiasm for the unity of the Empire were most evident during the two royal weddings and the birth of the royal grandson during the King's Jubilee. The Foreign Secretary then discussed domestic affairs, saying that there were various signs of general recovery, the two greatest elements of which were the restoration of credit and trust. This was necessary for a stable government, and it was restored primarily because of the good nature, common sense, and courage of the British people. He then discussed the British government's attitude towards foreign affairs, saying that we had signed the Covenant of the League of Nations and now had a responsibility to abide by it. We had spoken out against militarism, we could not abandon our friends in peacetime, and we held great power in the world, and it would be a sad waste to not use it. In this environment, I have tried to use British views to inform the League of Nations and the world as simply and clearly as possible, regardless of my success or failure, and regardless of how many others will accomplish their work with greater talent and effectiveness. The fact remains that the opinions I have expressed are, both in the past and now, the opinions of the majority of the people of this country.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then spoke of the British people's determination to abide by their commitments to Europe and the world, and continued, "They are also determined to add the full strength of their country to the measure of world peace. This is the attitude of the British people, and this attitude will not waver due to past events, geographical changes, or election changes. We intend to solemnly and diligently fulfill our obligations wherever we go, and strive for peace where peace is threatened. This aspiration has not changed since my speech in Geneva, and it will not change after the general election. This obligation places a heavy responsibility on the British people. In order to defend peace, Britain must be able to defend itself first, and must fulfill its full responsibility in any collective action. The defense of the Empire now has serious gaps, which is the result of Britain sincerely wanting to set an example for the world to move towards disarmament. In today's situation, the country cannot allow these gaps to remain for long. Governments around the world that are earnestly seeking peace will be comforted to see the re-establishment of the British Empire's forces for maintaining peace, and to be able to fully fulfill its responsibilities to the world. The government will move forward with greater courage and assurance, knowing that in the effort for peace, the United Kingdom has the firm and united support of the Empire."</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then praised the spirit of unity of the Empire in today's crisis, saying that the unity of the Empire in diplomacy and politics has never been greater than today. Without the loyal advice and active support of the representatives of the Dominions and India, Eden would not have been able to carry out our work in Geneva. The representatives of the Dominions also provided the League of Nations with valuable assistance from time to time. What is now becoming increasingly clear to the world is that the policy we are pursuing is not the policy of a transitional government on this small island, but the carefully considered and firmly adhered to policy of the entire British Empire. In expressing his gratitude for this assistance and cooperation, the Foreign Secretary paid particular attention to the assistance provided by the representatives of India and the Indian princes, saying that 1935 will go down in history as the year in which the British Parliament created the Indian Federation. We sincerely wish the new India success. British commentators have occasionally expressed dissatisfaction with the details of the Indian bill, but now that the Indian constitution has been enshrined in the law, we must do our best, both here and in India, to make it a great and lasting success.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then discussed the attitude of foreign countries towards the Ethiopian situation, saying that now, whether they are members of the League of Nations or not, they are almost everywhere earnestly supporting pacifism and wishing to shorten the duration of the Ethiopian war. Although there are now a few countries that are not members of the League of Nations acting on their own, they may eventually implement a part of the broad demands that we have decided on. Furthermore, one country with which we have a long and close relationship is now taking action of the same nature, namely Egypt. Egypt has already taken action to join the side of world peace. Recent events have clearly shown the strength of the friendly relationship and common interests between Britain and Egypt, which is very gratifying. There are now those in some quarters who falsely claim that the British government intends to take advantage of the current situation to sacrifice Egypt's interests for its own selfish gain. This is contrary to the facts. The British government has always strived to promote free and friendly cooperation between the two countries for their mutual benefit. Egypt has responded to us with a spirit of frank cooperation. There are also those who claim that we are opposed to restoring a constitutional system that is suited to Egypt's special needs. This is also nonsense. We adhere to traditional customs and cannot and do not want to interfere in this matter. However, if the Egyptian government consults us, we will advise it not to re-impose the constitutions of 1923 and 1930, as one has already been proven to be impractical to implement, and the other has been proven to be opposed by the people. History and geography bind the happiness of Britain and Egypt together. As friends and partners in cooperation, Britain and Egypt should treat each other with sincerity, face the facts, and resolve difficulties to the best of our ability. And we should each understand our innermost feelings. The Foreign Secretary then discussed the member states of the League of Nations, saying that there were things that were gratifying. Our peace policy is also their peace policy, and their peace policy is also our peace policy. Almost every capital city in the world has said that we clearly and resolutely support this policy, which has enhanced Britain's prestige in the world to an extent unprecedented in recent years, which I am very proud of.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary continued, "Let us quietly receive the lessons that this grave era has given us. The first thing we must bear in mind is that those who strive for a new world order, in order to make war no longer an instrument of policy, must not merely talk about peace, but must diligently work for peace. The second lesson we must learn is that if we must make sacrifices for collective action, then the sacrifices we must make are far less than the sacrifices we must make when collective action fails and war once again becomes an instrument for resolving international disputes. Finally, we must remember that the British Empire is rich in resources, strong in power, and noble in aspirations, and should fulfill great obligations and arduous responsibilities in the coming years. Lord Beaconsfield, one of Britain's most far-sighted politicians, once said, 'Our Empire is not a lowly hereditary estate, nor is it a hereditary estate that can only be enjoyed by sitting back and doing nothing, but an hereditary estate that must be maintained. To maintain it, we must have the same virtues as those who created it in the past, namely courage, discipline, perseverance, determination, respect for public law, and upholding national rights.'"

<h3 id="e26">MacDonald; The Last Hurdle of His Political Career <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(London) Lord Privy Seal MacDonald recently stayed at the home of a medical friend in the town of Isington, near West Ham, to participate in the West Ham election campaign. For the past two or three days, disturbances have occurred at the meetings when he has delivered campaign speeches. A special correspondent of the Havas News Agency recently visited MacDonald's residence to inquire about this matter. According to his reply, "Socialists and communists are colluding in an attempt to cause disturbances, so there have been noisy incidents at election meetings in the past two or three days. I sincerely hope that foreign people will not think that this is the custom of British elections." MacDonald, who had previously suffered from an eye disease, has recovered, but still looks tired. He frequently touches his eyes with his hand when speaking. The reporter then asked him about the outcome of this election. MacDonald declared, "The government can easily secure a victory in the election, and there is absolutely no doubt about that." He also said that voters who are experienced in the world will avoid noisy and eventful public gatherings, but will not avoid voting. He firmly believed that these voters would never change their support for his policies. As for his own policies, they have always been consistent. "I was a member of the Labour Party in 1931, and I am still a true member of the Labour Party today." MacDonald's political opponent in West Ham is the former Labour Cabinet Secretary, Xing Weil. His explanation for the disturbances that occurred during MacDonald's speech is clearly different. According to him, the National Cabinet has repeatedly broken its promises in the past, especially MacDonald. In order to express their dissatisfaction, British voters can only attack MacDonald during his campaign. It seems that Xing Weil has the support of the miners behind him. These were the people who supported MacDonald when he came to power in 1929. Unexpectedly, the hostility that MacDonald is now encountering is especially strong in the villages where these miners live. Sometimes it is not even a matter of political alignment, but rather an expression of personal grievances. For example, at this afternoon's meeting, when MacDonald delivered his speech, the meeting was relatively calm, but when he left the meeting, the crowd even hurled insults at him. Even in some areas, children on the street would shout "Down with MacDonald" when a car passed by. Such is the extent of their hostility. And surprisingly, those who now support MacDonald are mostly miners who live better lives and residents of some villages in West Ham. These were the people who attacked MacDonald in 1929. In general, the key to MacDonald's victory or defeat in the election depends on whether the other part of the workers besides the miners will join the group supporting MacDonald, as their power cannot be underestimated. In short, MacDonald's political career has reached the final stage, and the danger of his position is unprecedented since MacDonald entered politics. This can already be said with certainty.

<h3 id="e27">France and Germany Prepare to Negotiate a Arms Limitation Agreement <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>British Government's Opinion Consistent with France; Hitler's Special Envoy to Visit Paris</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed circles here are now discussing the matter of France possibly negotiating an arms limitation agreement with Germany. It is widely believed that this discussion will likely begin soon, as French Prime Minister Laval met with the French Ambassador to Berlin before returning to the capital. It is also believed that Hitler's special envoy for disarmament, Ribbentrop, may come here soon. Furthermore, according to the Labour News, Britain is now in agreement with France and is preparing to propose to Germany the conclusion of an arms limitation agreement, including a sky pact and a way to make it easier for Germany to obtain colonial raw materials. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It has recently been rumored that Ribbentrop, a close confidant of German Führer Hitler and a former special envoy for disarmament issues, will make a trip to Paris. Most newspapers here, such as the Ekusi Youbao, the Shiyebu, and the Figaro, have reported on this and discussed the issue of Franco-German relations. The famous journalist, Mrs. Tabui, published an article in the Shiyebu, stating that the German government's intention is now to get closer to the major powers, especially Russia and France. The German Ministry of Defense even wants to renew the Rapallo Treaty signed between Germany and Russia in 1922. "Therefore, there is no doubt that Germany wants to improve relations with France, and it is reliable that Ribbentrop will be a guest in Paris at the end of this month. However, when France and Germany conduct negotiations, the German government's demands will likely be limited to concluding a sky pact and recovering colonies, and will not involve other issues, as an exchange condition for promoting mutual understanding between the two countries." However, the German government's issue with the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact may be raised again when the countries concerned re-evaluate the meaning of the Locarno Treaty. Mrs. Tabui then commented on the issue of Germany's demand for the recovery of colonies, saying that Britain will likely reject this demand, because British Foreign Secretary Hall's previous statement about reallocating world raw materials only meant that countries could engage in business in other countries' colonies, and did not mean reallocating colonial sovereignty. "It is expected that Britain will obtain France's full agreement at the end of this month to propose a limited arms proposal to Germany, and at the same time conclude a sky pact, with the condition that Germany be allowed to engage in colonial business under certain terms. If Germany rejects this proposal at that time, Britain will actively expand its armaments to counter it. In short, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs seems to agree in principle with the idea of improving relations with Germany, but its specific plan does not seem to have been decided yet."

It was claimed that "those who spread rumors want to make people believe that Yugoslavia is in danger of being invaded by Italy, and therefore ordered mobilization to protect its territory. This statement is completely false. We do not know what the motives of the rumor-mongers are. It has also been said that the issue of amending the Tangier (in Spanish Morocco, Africa, is an international neutral territory, jointly administered by the consuls of Britain, France, and Spain) system has been discussed in recent international negotiations. This news is also untrue. In general, Anglo-Saxon (referring to Britain and the United States) newspapers like to make sensational claims whenever there are events related to the Mediterranean, like novelists, in order to attract attention."

<h3 id="e39">Government to Strictly Crack Down on Hoarding and Disrupting Finance <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Ministry of Finance's currency control, many people have exchanged the cash they had accumulated in compliance with the order. According to sources in the financial circles of this city, during this exchange of cash for legal tender, a few merchants secretly took the opportunity to buy silver dollars, using premiums as bait, with premiums of 1-2 cents per yuan, with the aim of smuggling them to other ports. It is heard that this phenomenon also exists in the Tianjin market, where 100 yuan in cash can be exchanged for 140 yuan in paper money. The government will strictly crack down on their hoarding and disruption of finance. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggling of silver dollars has never been completely prohibited in Tangshan due to its special circumstances. Recently, since the Ministry of Finance issued an emergency order, unscrupulous merchants and ruffians have taken the opportunity to buy them in large quantities, causing the premium on silver dollars to rise from 20 yuan per 100 yuan to 43 yuan. Copper coins have also soared, soaring to 380 coins yesterday, and there is nowhere to exchange them. The prices of food and other daily necessities have increased by about one-third. The Public Security Bureau has added measures to crack down, but it has not had a significant effect. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Copper coins in Tangshan are increasingly rising, with only 340 coins exchanged per yuan. The market is chaotic, and the price of rice and flour has risen again. Many stores are exchanging legal tender, and the gates of the five banks are extremely crowded. The market prices of Tianjin copper coins, rice, and flour on the 10th are still fluctuating. Unscrupulous merchants are seeking profit by refusing to exchange copper coins altogether. Although the Public Security Bureau has announced an official price of 500 coins per yuan and ordered the food industry to earnestly stabilize prices, it has not been effective. The municipal government plans to hold a meeting on the 11th to discuss a comprehensive solution. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Designates Provincial and Municipal Banknotes as Legal Tender; Silver Coins Cease to be Legal Tender from the 7th</p>
<p>(Guangzhou correspondence) Since the Ministry of Finance announced the unified currency paper money method, Guangdong Province has mainly used silver small coins as the standard, which has no major impact. However, the Guangdong financial authorities are also afraid of cash outflow, so on the 6th of this month, the Department of Finance promulgated measures for centralized management of currency, stipulating that silver small coin notes, silver dollar notes, and Guangzhou Municipal Bank's vouchers of the Provincial Bank are legal tender. From the 7th, all silver coins ceased to be legal tender. Public and private transactions were limited to legal tender, and silver small coins were prohibited. Silver coins circulating in the market were purchased by the Provincial Bank at a calculated price and were not allowed to be collected. The custody and issuance of legal tender reserve funds were handled by the Government-People Joint Issuance Reserve Management Committee. The Department of Finance's announcement on the 6th is appended below:</p>
<p>"For announcement matters, since the price of silver soared last year, silver has been overflowing, endlessly. As a result, currency has been tightening, the market has been rotating sluggishly, commerce has been declining day by day, rural areas have been lacking the strength to rescue, industry has been unable to develop, the dumping of foreign goods has been increasing, and the number of excess imports has been increasing. All of this is enough to cause a state of collapse and increase unemployed people. The central government, in view of this, has resolutely promulgated a currency management order to provide relief. This province is in the same situation and should follow it to try to save it. If the difference between the price of silver and the value of currency is farther away, the outflow of silver will be more severe, and it will not stop until it is completely exhausted. The national economy and people's livelihood will fall into a state of irreversible destruction. The function of currency lies in stabilizing prices and matching supply and demand. The government, based on this principle and for the purpose of preserving the province's existing silver and regulating finance, has approved the following measures by the Guangdong Provincial Government and announced their implementation. The issuance of paper money is absolutely open, and the principle of matching supply and demand is adopted. No matter what, the expansion policy will never be adopted. As for the collection of silver, public custody measures have also been stipulated to show great credibility and avoid outflow. From now on, the relief of industry and commerce and the revitalization of rural areas will rely on it. This is specially announced."</p>
<p>The details are as follows: (1) From November 7th of this year, the silver small coin notes and silver dollar notes of the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the vouchers of the Guangzhou Municipal Bank will be legal tender. All revenue and payment of grain tax and all public and private funds will be limited to legal tender. Cash shall not be used or hidden to prevent the theft of silver. Those who smuggle it for export shall be punished in accordance with the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China. (2) The custody and issuance of legal tender reserve funds shall be handled by the Government-People Joint Organization Issuance Reserve Management Committee to show openness and credibility. The organizational charter of the committee will be determined separately. (3) After the promulgation of these measures, all silver small coins and silver dollars have lost their effect as currency and should be fully recovered by the government and handed over to the committee for safekeeping. All silver small coins or silver dollars owned by banks, money shops, shops, and public and private institutions or individuals should be exchanged for small coin notes from November 7th at the head office of the Guangdong Provincial Bank and its branches, offices, exchange offices, and the Guangzhou Municipal Bank or other designated agencies. The fixed silver small coin is added by two to settle the value, and the silver dollar is added by four four to settle the value. (One yuan of silver small coins is exchanged for one yuan and two small coins, and one yuan of silver dollars is exchanged for one yuan, four small coins, and four cents.) In the area where silver dollars are used, the exchange of silver dollars shall be calculated by adding two to the face value and paid with silver dollar notes. (4) All silver products, such as silver bars, silver bricks, and silver cakes, shall be handed over to the Guangdong Provincial Bank from November 7th for purchase at a price calculated according to the fineness, and shall not be hidden. (5) All contracts concluded in silver coin units before November 6th shall be settled and paid in legal tender at maturity according to the original amount. (6) All foreign currencies stored by the people may be freely bought and sold to meet the needs of foreign exchange, but may not be used directly. (November 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Guangdong Province Plans to Implement State Control of Foreign Trade <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Adopting Barter as the Guiding Principle; Establishing a Trade Authority to Govern All Matters</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Regarding the situation of Guangdong Province's foreign trade, according to customs statistics, in 1914, the merchandise import surplus for the entire year was only slightly over 23 million yuan. This figure has steadily increased year by year, reaching over 142 million yuan in 1932. Simultaneously, the export of domestic goods has been decreasing annually. In 1914, exported goods were valued at approximately 87 million yuan, but by 1931, this had dwindled to just over 19 million yuan. Imports and exports are inversely proportional. Furthermore, in recent years, overseas Chinese remittances have not only ceased but there has also been a draining of funds from the mainland to support overseas businesses. The outflow of capital for exports cannot be compensated for, resulting in a worsening social and economic decline. Factory closures and worker unemployment are causing deep concern among those who care about social and economic affairs. Recently, the Association for the Protection of Private Industries specifically submitted a proposal for state control of Guangdong Province's foreign trade to the Guangdong Political Research Association for discussion. The so-called state control of foreign trade policy means that all export and import goods in the province will be controlled by the government, adopting the principle of barter. The export of cash will be prohibited to balance imports and exports or to achieve a merchandise export surplus. In other words, imported goods can only be exchanged for equivalent goods or raw materials, not for cash. The transactions between the two parties will be managed by an agency established by the government. Simultaneously, this agency will promote international markets and collect raw materials and goods for export, while implicitly restricting the import of non-essential foreign goods. If implemented successfully, the import of goods will be implicitly restricted, and the export of goods will inevitably increase. Domestic assets will continue to circulate within the country. This approach adopts administrative measures and is not bound by tariff agreements or other unequal treaties. The following are the detailed measures for state control of foreign trade:</p>
<p>(1) The provincial government, together with merchants, will establish the Guangdong Foreign Trade Authority to control foreign trade. All foreign trade merchants must register with the Authority and be subject to its governance regarding foreign trade matters. (2) The Authority will be economically independent, managed jointly by committee members selected by merchants and those appointed by the provincial government, and will be supervised by the provincial government. (3) All foreign trade, whether selling goods for export or importing goods, must go through the Trade Authority. The Authority will handle both the placing and transporting of orders. (4) If Guangdong Province already produces the same goods as foreign imports, the Trade Authority has the right to refuse to place orders abroad. (5) Merchants who import foreign goods must export Guangdong goods of equivalent value in exchange. All exchange funds must be exclusively used for the Authority's vouchers, and voucher regulations will be formulated separately. (6) The Authority will use strict statistical methods each month to report the gains and losses of imports and exports, as well as price fluctuations, to maintain a balanced situation. (7) The Authority will publicly announce to overseas merchants the quantity and progress of both parties' supply and demand each month. (8) The Authority will establish a sample office to collect and display samples of needed domestic and foreign goods for selection. (9) The Authority is responsible for the successful completion of both domestic and foreign goods transactions. (10) A low handling fee will be charged on all import and export transactions to subsidize the Authority's expenses. The fee regulations will be formulated separately. (11) For factories and shops with overproduction of certain goods, the Authority should order them to cooperate with their peers to reduce production or order some of their peers to switch to other production that meets needs. Furthermore, if the quality or style of products from various factories does not meet the foreign market demand, the Authority can order them to improve. (12) Upon the establishment of the Authority, the highest provincial authorities will issue an order to all provincial agencies, military police, and organizations to assist. (13) The Authority will have eleven committee members, five of whom will be jointly selected by the Provincial Chamber of Commerce and the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, and six of whom will be appointed by the provincial government, with three of those appointed by the provincial government serving as standing committee members. (14) The organizational rules for the standing committee of the Authority, the sample office, and other sections will be formulated separately. (15) The government will allocate 5,000 yuan to the Authority each month. However, when the revenue from the handling fees in Article 10 is sufficient to cover this amount, the government will suspend the allocation. When the revenue exceeds this amount, the excess will be allocated for the second and third phase expansion. (16) The government will initially allocate 40,000 yuan for the Authority's start-up expenses to build the Authority's premises and equipment. The following two items will be expanded in phases: A. Building warehouses, approximately 120,000 yuan (this item can be handled in the second phase of expansion; in the initial phase, goods can be temporarily stored in the warehouses originally operated by Japanese merchants). B. Building warehouses in important cities and commercial ports, approximately 200,000 yuan in total (this item can be handled in the second phase of expansion). (November 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Wuhu Chamber of Commerce Asks the Three Banks to Exchange Various Currencies <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>—Chamber of Commerce Federation Asks for More Exchange Locations—</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: Since the implementation of the new currency policy here, the market's finances have been unusually stable. Those with silver dollars are exchanging them for legal tender at the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. However, due to manipulation by unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate, copper coins have been rising wildly in price for days. On the 9th, the Money Trade Association's listed price rose another yuan, with the exchange rate shrinking from 356 coins to 310 coins, and there is nowhere to exchange them. Other commodity prices are still stable. The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation recently received reports from chambers of commerce in various counties and towns, stating that there are very few branch agencies of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in inland counties and towns to exchange legal tender, making it impossible to implement. If villagers use cash, it is inevitable that some will use this as an excuse to deliberately conceal and hide money to evade taxes. Moreover, paper money is easy to counterfeit, making it difficult to distinguish between genuine and fake, resulting in great harm. Although it is a premature worry, it must be prevented. It is requested that the legal tender be maintained. The Federation, based on this, believes that this matter is of great importance and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on the 9th, earnestly requesting permission to order the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to quickly set up more legal tender exchange locations in various inland counties and towns to facilitate exchange and avoid harm. Furthermore, the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, to discuss maintaining commodity prices, held a meeting on the afternoon of the 8th and resolved to issue a notice to merchants and residents, ordering them not to raise commodity prices again. At the same time, a letter was sent to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications stating that various foreign currencies should be treated as hard currency and allowed to be exchanged for legal tender uniformly, without rejection, to maintain the market and stabilize commerce.

<h3 id="e63">After the Currency Reform, Prices Soar in Beiping <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Prices of Rice, Grain, Cloth, and Other Goods Rise Sharply; Chamber of Commerce Discusses Stabilizing Finance and Suppressing Prices</p>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Since the promulgation of the currency reform order, rice and grain merchants in Shanghai and Tianjin have mostly colluded to raise grain prices or hoard large quantities of grain to manipulate the market. As a result, Beiping City has received reports of rising prices in Shanghai and Tianjin markets, and prices have also risen sharply. Today, rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains continue to rise. Simultaneously, cloth, coal, lumber, pigments, and paper are also affected by the high prices in the Shanghai and Tianjin international markets, and prices are rising sharply. According to Gao Luntang, Chairman of the Cloth Industry Association, the market prices for coarse cloth and bamboo cloth suddenly rose by more than one yuan on the 7th, which is entirely due to the influence of the Shanghai market. Furthermore, most of the imported sundries and groceries and kerosene and gasoline sold in the city are supplied by Japan, Britain, and the United States. Recently, due to the currency reform and the soaring price of gold, foreign countries have also raised prices sharply. According to investigations, the price of gasoline from Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum has risen by about one yuan per barrel. At the same time, the two commercial areas of Dong'an and Xidan in Beiping City, which have the widest distribution of imported sundries and groceries, usually sell at fixed prices, but today they have mostly set different prices, with each item rising by about one-tenth.</p>
<p>The Beiping City Chamber of Commerce held an emergency general meeting at the assembly hall at 2:00 PM today, attended by more than 60 people. Chairman Zou Quansun first reported on the telegram received from the Ministry of Finance and Kong Xiangxi, informing them that silver dollars had been nationalized and legal tender would be used universally, and then provided an explanation. Then, there was a discussion on stabilizing finance and suppressing the soaring prices of food and various commodities in the city to maintain the people's livelihood. As a result of the discussion, a concrete plan was decided, and then a joint meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, and the Money Trade Association will be held to present this plan for discussion, decision, and public announcement. The Money Trade Association, due to the recent financial crunch, believes that various silver firms have been greatly affected by the banks' concentration of reserve funds. Last night at 8:00 PM, a special meeting of members was convened to discuss methods for members to mutually allocate and exchange funds to facilitate circulation and prevent financial impacts. At the same time, fundamental remedies for the financial crunch will also be presented at the joint meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, and the Money Trade Association for decision.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Kong Xiangrong Discusses the Fundamental Plan for Harnessing the Yellow River <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Requires 60 Million Yuan and Will Be Completed in Five Years</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, after taking office, based on his many years of experience, drafted a fundamental plan for harnessing the Yellow River, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, with the aim of permanently eliminating river disasters. It is currently being revised. Shandong is in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and is of great importance. Therefore, Kong came to Jinan to solicit opinions from Chairman Han of the Provincial Government and Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department and concurrently Chairman of the Committee for Blocking Breaches. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Kong and asked about the content of the plan. According to him, the reasons for the Yellow River's disasters are: (1) The upper reaches have a lot of wind-blown sand and loess, which flow downstream, causing severe siltation and raising the riverbed day by day. (2) In the middle reaches, the various rivers in Shaanxi and Henan experience flash floods in summer and autumn, all of which flow into the Yellow River, and the riverbed cannot accommodate them. (3) The lower reaches have a river course that is too narrow, and the outlet to the sea is not smooth, which causes breaches. Based on the above three reasons, the fundamental plan for harnessing the Yellow River proposed by the Commission is: (1) Afforestation in the upper reaches to prevent wind-blown sand. In addition to the existing Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College on the Wei River being responsible for planning, it is planned to establish eleven more forest farms along the banks of the river and its main tributaries, such as Luoning in the Luo River basin, Songxian in the Yi River basin, Qingyuan in the Qin River basin, Fenyang and Pingyao in the Fen River basin, and Qingjian in the Qingjian River</p>
<h3 id="e65">Current Status of Japanese Finances <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>—A Glance</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of Manchuria began four years ago. During these four years, Japan's financial situation has not only failed to improve, but has also deteriorated. In the winter of 1932, Japan's government bonds were only 6.1 billion yuan. By June of this year, they had increased to 10.4 billion. Local bonds were 1.685 billion yuan four years ago, but by June of this year, they had exceeded 2.4 billion. The total national debt has reached 13 billion. The increase of 5 billion yuan is almost entirely due to the cost of military operations in China and the expansion of military equipment.</p>
<p>Although the four northeastern provinces are rich in resources, it is not yet the time for Japan to extract profits there. The anti-Japanese armies in the northeast rise and fall intermittently, and the entire territory is not stable. Unless huge security expenses are invested again, it may not be possible to reap substantial profits. However, Japan's financial resources are already stretched thin. The country is full of internal problems and cannot even save itself. How can it have the surplus to invest abroad? Moreover, in recent years, the masses of the people have been increasingly impoverished, and the middle class has been reduced to poverty. The financial community is alarmed by the government's issuance of more bonds. Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo is deeply aware of the financial difficulties and uses his keen skills to try to economize on the huge budgets of various provinces. He also cares for the people's livelihood and dares not increase taxes. But where does the direct expenditure of 5 billion yuan of bonds come from? In short, there is no other way than from the banks. Four years ago, banks held only 1.811 billion yuan in government bonds. By July of this year, they had increased to 4.146 billion yuan, plus 443 million yuan in local bonds. Insurance companies invested about 50 million yuan in government bonds. Therefore, conflicts have already occurred within Japan's ruling class. Even the radicals in the military often use the "extraordinary times" as a pretext to demand huge new military expenditures. The conservatives, on the other hand, are trying to restrain them because the financial future is very dangerous. This is why Finance Minister Takahashi warned at the end of last year to restrict investment in Manchuria and seriously opposed the issuance of more bonds in July of this year.</p>
<p>Recalling that last year, the navy and army proposed huge budget requests, Takahashi resigned in anger. His successor, Fujii, was also eventually sacrificed for budget issues. As soon as the difficult situation passed, the army and navy again demanded 1.3 billion yuan more for next year's budget than this year's budget. The army also wanted to independently establish a five-year military expansion plan worth 1.65 billion yuan, of which 900 million yuan would be used to strengthen military facilities in Manchuria to consolidate defense against Russia. If this plan is to be realized, more bonds must be issued. However, the lower and middle classes cannot afford it, and the financial system is very exhausted. Finance Minister Takahashi has no golden touch. Where can he get this huge sum? Thus, a covert struggle between the conservatives and the radicals, the advocates of currency contraction and the advocates of currency inflation, has formed.</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in Japan's financial community, we can better understand the exhaustion of Japan's financial resources. For example, bank savings have increased by 500 million yuan in form in the past four years, and have now reached 3.2 billion yuan. But in reality, it is just a matter of moving east to make up for the west, and making a forced adjustment. In September 1931, the savings in the treasury were 1.003 billion yuan in government bonds and 590 million yuan in local bonds. In June of this year, government bonds reached 1.717 billion yuan and local bonds reached 950 million yuan. In other words, the new and old savings have been transferred to government bonds through the treasury. In addition to government bonds, there are also 855 million yuan of semi-official enterprise bonds, which are also included in the treasury of the savings department. Of the 3.2 billion yuan in savings, more than 3.5 billion yuan is invested in securities. The total of government bonds and local bonds, 12.79 billion yuan, has 8 billion yuan fixed in the treasuries of financial groups. However, the total mobilized capital of Japanese financial groups is only 18 to 19 billion. Half of it is now fixed in the treasury.</p>
<p>With securities so rampant and the bond market gradually falling, the average minimum index of stocks four years ago was 59.9. In recent months, a semi-panic drop has suddenly occurred. On July 1, the average market price of industrial stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 92 lower than a year ago. As a result, the value of securities buried in the treasury has lost 20 percent. Although the inflation of paper money is not obvious, the amount of paper money issued by the Bank of Japan has also decreased in form. However, the amount of paper money issued by the Bank of Korea and the Bank of Taiwan has increased. Moreover, the expansion of military demand affects the balanced development of the national industry. For example, in the first half of this year, investment in new industrial, transportation, and commercial enterprises decreased by 48 percent compared with last year. Investment in companies decreased by 33 percent. The issuance of new corporate bonds decreased by 15 percent. The borrowing and replacement of old corporate bonds decreased by 78 percent. The production volume of most industries has been decreasing rapidly in recent months. The steel industry alliance has restricted production by 30 percent. The textile industry and the strong weaving industry have forced work reduction. In addition, countries resist the dumping of Japanese goods. The Japanese-Egyptian trade treaty and the Japanese-Canadian trade regulations were successively abolished. Its position in international credit has gradually been lost. Therefore, although the financial authorities are working hard to save this critical situation, they have been unable to make up for it. If a huge increase in military expenditure is added, the collapse of the entire economy will be difficult to avoid.</p>

<p>basin, and Suide in the Wuding River basin, and Xie County and Qingyang Jingchuan in the Jing River basin to be afforested in phases. (2) Building flood control reservoirs in the middle reaches. Summer and autumn floods carry sediment downstream, and the river cannot accommodate them. This is the biggest cause of breaches every year. In the future, it is planned to set up flood control reservoirs to block floods and allow them to flow down gradually, so as to avoid the danger of breaches. It is planned to set up several model areas first for testing. The locations are approximately in Lingbao, Sarachi, Pingliang, Qianxian, and Suide. This type of flood control reservoir allows flood sediment to flow down gradually and is different from old-style reservoirs that store water permanently. (3) Dredging the sea outlet and opening tributaries in the lower reaches. The Yellow River's outlet to the sea is increasingly silted, resulting in poor official drainage. In the future, it is planned to implement water diversion projects at the sea outlet and open more tributaries to facilitate drainage. Then, Shandong can permanently avoid river disasters. The total planned cost is 60 million yuan, which will take four or five years to complete, requiring about 10 million yuan per year. After the completion of this plan, it will be submitted to the National Economic Commission for review.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Anhui Provincial Finance Department Plans to Reorganize Official Property and Reclaim Wasteland <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Continuing to Promote Conscientiously According to the Original Plan</p>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: Since the National Finance Conference decided to transfer the affairs of official property reclamation in Anhui Province to the provincial government, the revenue from this item, as a central subsidy for local undertakings, was originally set at 100,000 yuan per year, included in the budget estimate for 1933, and submitted to the former Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters, which reduced it to 160,000 yuan. In 1934, after deducting expenses, it was also listed as 160,000 yuan. However, since taking over, the establishment of a department in the Finance Department and the commencement of operations in various counties and bureaus were all after the autumn harvest in 1933. Preparation took time, making it difficult to achieve quick results. Moreover, 1934 happened to be a year of severe drought, with a full year of wasteland, resulting in revenue of only slightly over 60,000 yuan. Furthermore, most of the large-scale wasteland in Anhui Province has already been disposed of by the former Anhui Provincial Reclamation Agency and the bureau established by the Ministry. What remains now are only a few plots of land that have not yet been released, among which there are many disputes, making it difficult to clear them up. Now the Finance Department intends to continue to promote conscientiously according to the original plan and has specially pre-determined this year's plan, and the inquiry is as follows: (A) Official Property Section: Investigations into the official property in this province, such as former government offices, post stations, warehouse land, horse school prisoner relief and other fields, as well as confiscated land and buildings used as collateral for payment, are located everywhere. The civil, financial, construction and education departments each manage a portion, and some are managed by the local county government, while others are still privately occupied by the people and have not yet been found. It is planned to use two methods of reorganization, as left: 1. Official property in the custody of government offices: This official property is either in the custody of various departments or scattered in various counties. To obtain accurate statistics, it is necessary to start with registration. It is planned to select those that are not necessary for public use, and the responsible authorities will estimate the value according to the regulations and prepare to sell them. The proceeds will be reported to the Finance Department and handed over to the treasury for collection, and then submitted to the provincial government for the issuance of a license to operate. For this official property that still needs to be retained for use, it is planned to immediately formulate regulations for the rental of official property and temporarily rent it out according to the regulations by the valley custody agency. All rental income will be reported to the Finance Department for delivery to the treasury for collection. 2. Official property privately occupied by the people: This official property has been occupied by the people. Without a detailed investigation, it is impossible to know the full story. It is planned to order the county bureaus to first issue a notice within a time limit, ordering the private occupiers to estimate the value and post it for bidding. If they comply with the marked price and submit it, they will be allowed to issue a license. If they fail to report beyond the time limit and still attempt to conceal it, once discovered, their priority right to receive the land will be revoked and another bidder will be sought to prevent anyone from taking advantage of the situation. (B) Wasteland Reclamation Section: Investigations into the ownerless wasteland in this province, such as various riverbanks, lakeside, riverside shoals, and newly accreted old land, are found in all counties in central and northern Anhui. As for barren mountains, they are mostly found in counties in southern Anhui. However, the situation is extremely complicated, and disputes are inevitable. Some have not yet been reclaimed, some have been privately reclaimed and matured but have not yet paid the price, and some have reported reclamation but have not yet paid the price. Without a thorough investigation, it is not enough to organize them. It is also planned to use three methods, listed as follows: 1. Wasteland that has not been reclaimed: This wasteland will be investigated and surveyed by the county bureaus, and personnel will be sent to measure and mark the boundaries, publicly solicit reclamation, and the county bureaus will estimate the grades and submit them for approval. Immediately collect the price fees and report the application for a license. For large sections of wasteland that cannot be reclaimed and matured without constructing dikes, digging ditches, and drainage projects, the counties will be asked to prepare concrete engineering plans and submit them to the province for approval. The province will then allocate funds for the work. The land that has matured due to the construction work will become official property of the province, and the county will recruit tenants to cultivate it, collect rent on schedule, and report it to the provincial treasury. 2. Wasteland that has been privately matured: The original reclaimers will still be ordered to pay the price and take over the land. If the original reclaimers cannot afford to pay the price or refuse to comply, another reclaimer will be sought, and the reclaimer will compensate the original reclaimer for the reclamation fees to show consideration. 3. Wasteland where the price has not been fully paid: The original recipients will also be ordered to clear the payment. If they are indeed unable to continue paying the price, the amount of land will be allocated according to the amount that has been paid, and the remainder will be publicly announced for reclamation. The reclamation fee will also be compensated by the continued recipient. Disputes over the release of wasteland over the years should also be resolved. In addition to the general conditions, the county governments responsible for handling them, the major cases, such as Tiancheng Lake Yitaiwei in Wuhu, Gulang Lake in Sixian, etc., have been in litigation for many years, or the disputed area is more than 100,000 mu. If this continues to be delayed, it will only increase the burden of litigation on the people and reduce the income of the provincial treasury. It is planned to send special commissioners to the county to conduct an on-site survey and properly formulate a clearance plan to ensure that all outstanding cases are cleared within the year. The parties in dispute will each operate in accordance with the delineated land, pay taxes, and if there is any violation of orders and forcible occupation, the county governments responsible will be responsible for stopping it. Although the above-mentioned implementation methods are determined according to the regulations and after considering the situation, this province has now organized a land declaration. In addition to the official property item, because it has always been kept in the custody of various departments and counties, the county bureaus will still implement the clearance according to the original official property regulations. As for the wasteland reclamation item, it is planned to combine the counties that have already handled the land declaration into the land declaration case, and order the chiefs of each Baojia to be responsible for reporting the ownerless official wasteland, listing and numbering it, and submitting it for further disposal. Those who have been privately reclaimed by the people will still be ordered to declare it themselves according to the regulations to determine property rights. (November 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Jiaodong: Tobacco Leaf Prices Plummet <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Oversupply, No Buyers: Impacts Farmer Livelihoods Severely</p>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: Jiaodong's Linzi, Yidu, Weixian, Anqiu, and other counties are famous tobacco-producing areas. Annual production is valued at approximately 20 million yuan. Each official mu of tobacco leaves can fetch as much as 300 yuan, or at least around 100 yuan. Therefore, many farmers rely on tobacco cultivation for their livelihoods, especially in Linzi and Yidu, where planting is most prevalent. Every early summer, they compete to plant. From summer to autumn, it takes about 100 days to harvest completely. After drying and sorting, the leaves are graded into first, second, and third classes and transported to nearby tobacco companies for sale. Tobacco companies have established branches along the Jiaoji Railway to purchase in large quantities, such as at Xindian, Yangjiazhuang, Tanjiabuzi, Weixian, Ershilibu, Fangzi, and Huangqibao stations along the Jiaoji Railway. During the tobacco season, hundreds of tobacco companies gather at these stations, competing to buy. The British-American Tobacco Company (BAT), the American Tobacco Company, and the Japanese Mitsui &amp; Co., Nanshin, Zhongnan's Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Huacheng, Shanghai Tobacco Company, and Hefeng are the largest buyers. Last year, over two thousand carloads were transported out via the Jiaoji Railway, with a total value of approximately 18 million yuan. However, due to last year's higher production, supply exceeded demand. Coupled with the widespread economic recession, tobacco prices have plummeted this year. Currently, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company still has over 3.8 million yuan worth of tobacco leaves in stock, sufficient for one and a half years. Shanghai Tobacco Company also has seven-tenths in stock. Other companies also have surpluses. Therefore, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company and Shanghai Tobacco Company are no longer purchasing this year. Only BAT, the American Tobacco Company, and small companies formed by tobacco merchants are still buying, but there are only about thirty such companies along the Jiaoji Railway. These companies are taking the opportunity to further depress tobacco prices. Last year's 30 yuan per 100 pounds is now only worth 17 or 18 yuan. Additionally, this year's tobacco leaf harvest is poor, with many farmers sacrificing their capital and reducing prices to sell, yet they still struggle to sell their goods. The general tobacco farmers are complaining incessantly, and the direct impact on the rural economy is quite significant.</p>
<p>Songfa: The First District Prepares for Winter Defense</p>
<p>The county government recently convened a winter defense meeting, established a winter defense office, and decided to implement the plan from the 16th of this month. After receiving the order, Shen Fuyun, the district head of the first district, followed the usual practice and convened the heads of various townships and towns yesterday, and invited the police chief to hold a winter defense meeting. After District Head Shen reported the purpose of the meeting, they discussed how to prepare for winter defense issues. It was resolved to follow the established procedures from last year during the winter defense period. Yu Kuisun, Dai Lianzhang, Liao Zhaoshun, and Wang Jinyun were designated to preside over the first district, Liu Fenghao, Che Yiru, and Huang Runhan to preside over the second district, and Ju Weichun and Long Xueqin to preside over the third district. The heads of other townships and towns will preside separately. It is planned to add sixteen police officers to the first district, twenty-seven to the second district, and eleven to the third district. Nine will be added to Pīyún Town and three to Huayang Town. The monthly salary for squad leaders is eleven yuan, and for police officers, nine yuan. The director and deputy director will select economic committee members to solicit donations and distribute the salaries monthly. The uniforms and insignias will follow the same style as last year, and the district office will manufacture and distribute them.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Grain Dealers Schedule Opening of Warehouses</p>
<p>This year's rice harvest in various villages has been successively reaped and brought to the threshing grounds, with yields estimated at around seventy percent. Grain dealers are preparing to convene meetings to collect rent. It has been decided that the maximum rent conversion rate will be 7.5 yuan per unit of rice. The opening dates for the warehouses of various grain dealers have also been determined separately, with the earliest being the 16th and the majority opening on the 20th. The Public Security Bureau, to protect tenants who pay their rent in full, ordered the detective team on the 10th to dispatch plainclothes detectives to strengthen security. Regarding the issue of rent collection, in previous years, the county government nominally organized tenant rent disposal offices to detain tenants who owed rent, with the expenses borne by the grain dealers. This year, a decision has been made to change the method, with the county government making administrative rulings to avoid conflicts with the judicial system, and the tenant rent disposal offices will no longer be organized.</p>
<p>Wuxi: County Magistrate Wang Resigns, Retention Attempted</p>
<p>Wang Baoxuan, the county magistrate of this county, recently requested to resign due to poor health and inability to cope with the heavy workload. The Civil Affairs Department, considering the various policies being actively promoted and relying heavily on him, did not approve his resignation and warmly urged him to stay. He was granted ten days of leave for recuperation. County Magistrate Wang has gone to Shanghai for medical treatment, and all official duties are being handled by Secretary Xia Dingwen.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Banks Abolish Legal Tender Exchange Fees</p>
<p>The banking community in Wujin County held a meeting at Yu's residence in Yangliu Lane on the afternoon of the 9th. Representatives from eight banks, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Wujin Bank, Jiangsu Bank, Farmers Bank of China, Credit Fides Mutual Bank, and Guohua Bank, attended. The resolved matters are as follows: (1) Exchange fees for legal tender remittances will be abolished, and a handling fee will be charged instead. Within the province, it will be 5 jiao per 1,000 yuan. Outside the province, regardless of distance, it will be 1 yuan. Telegraphic transfers will incur additional telegraphic fees. (2) Handling fees will be charged for small remittances. Within the province, it will be calculated according to the previous clause, with a minimum charge of 1 jiao. Outside the province, if the fee is less than 2 jiao, the minimum charge will be 2 jiao. (3) Out-of-town payments and collection of bills of exchange for correspondent factories and firms will be subject to handling fees according to the remittance method and credited on the date of receipt. For deferred payments on the Beijing-Shanghai line, the credit will be delayed by one day. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Crackdown on Deliberate Price Gouging</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of Commerce, in order to crack down on deliberate price gouging, issued an order to local chambers of commerce, stating that the Ministry of Finance has promulgated legal tender and stopped using silver dollars in order to stabilize the financial situation and revive the economy. However, speculative merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate and hoard goods, causing various prices to suddenly skyrocket. If strict measures are not taken to crack down on this, it will inevitably affect people's livelihoods and disrupt market order. The chamber of commerce should promptly convene trade associations within three days, determine prices based on the cost of goods, and uniformly comply. Anyone deliberately raising prices should be reported immediately for severe punishment.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhishi, a native of Zhuji, Zhejiang, was arrested in Shanghai in 1932 due to political reasons and sentenced to a heavy crime in Nanjing. Recently, through the intercession of friends, the authorities have restored his freedom. After several years of recuperation, Mr. Zhou is now in good health, both physically and mentally. He recently passed through Hangzhou on his way back to his hometown, where he will engage in reading and writing.</p>

<p>Ministry of Railways Convenes Railway Accounting and Statistics Committee</p>
<p>Since Zhang Jingli, the Chief Accountant of the Ministry of Railways, took on the additional role of Chairman of the Railway Accounting and Statistics Committee, he has vigorously rectified the system, achieving remarkable results. The fourth general meeting is scheduled to be convened on the 11th of this month to discuss important proposals such as the unification of railway accounting procedures and statistical regulations. The committee members from various railway lines have been appointed and have reported to the Ministry. In addition to the heads of various sections, the Chief Accountant's Office has also designated Wu Junshi, Wu Yinghao, Sun Baolian, and others as attending members.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Military Impersonation Case Cracked</p>
<p>Sun Jianshi, the 24-year-old grandson of Sun Youshan, the owner of the former Anju Dormitory in Jiaxing, specialized in colluding with recruitment officers, falsely using names to swindle and deceive, causing countless victims. Recently, he organized a military agency in Beimeng Tannong. Yesterday, he ordered ten blue-bordered insignias of the 58th Division Headquarters from Yixin Printing Shop, which was discovered by the First Squad of the County Security Corps. On the morning of the 9th, Hu Weizhong and Sun Jianshi were arrested successively, and a forged seal of the Commander of the 58th Division of the Army (wood-carved), ten white silk insignias, five pawn tickets, one set of yellow military uniform, one badge of the Officer Education Corps of the Zhejiang Security Office, one bayonet, two letters, and one small map were seized. Subsequently, Shen Guantin and Shen Ruheng, who were involved in the case, were also detained. They were immediately taken by the squad to the supervisory office of the county government for interrogation. As the case involved impersonating a military agency, the suspects will be transferred by the county government to the headquarters for investigation.</p>
<p>Haimen: Arson by an Enemy Claims Seven Lives</p>
<p>Zhu Nianbang and Zhu Nianlun, residents of the 16th Bao of Guanglie Township in the Third District, lived in the same house. At 11:00 PM on the 6th, an enemy committed arson, burning all five thatched rooms and miscellaneous items. Zhu Nianbang's wife, Sun, his eldest daughter, Zhenli, his young daughter, Xiaobao, Zhu Nianlun's son, Yunfang, his daughters, Yunda, Yunmei, and Xiufang, a total of seven people, were unable to escape and perished in the fire. Their severed limbs and mangled bodies were a tragic sight. On the morning of the 7th, the incident was reported to the county government by the local public security substation. In the afternoon, Chen, the assessor, went to inspect the scene, ordered the family members to prepare coffins and instructed the police to secretly investigate the arsonist for prosecution.</p>

<p>Educational Broadcast Supplement: How the Sun, Moon, and Stars Move, and the Phenomena Resulting from Their Movement</p>
<h3 id="e70">(3) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— (Lecture to the National Public on October 18th, 21st, 27th, and 28th) Researcher at the Astronomical Research Institute of the Academia Sinica: Chen ZunGui</p>
<p>What I have said above only applies to the Big Dipper. The arrangement of other fixed stars also changes in the same way, but their changes require hundreds of thousands of years to become noticeable. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for us to call them permanent and unchanging and refer to them as fixed stars. Now, by observing the movement of the Big Dipper, we can understand that the movement of fixed stars can be divided into two types. One is perpendicular to the sky and our line of sight, which is called the proper motion of the fixed stars. The other is aligned with our line of sight, which is called radial velocity. After understanding these two types of movement, we can understand the movement of fixed stars in space and their speed in miles per second. Since the sun is also a fixed star, it also has these two types of movement. As a result of its movement, our entire solar system is moving towards the constellation Hercules at a speed of approximately 20 kilometers per second.</p>
<p>The movement of fixed stars usually appears to be random in all directions. However, upon closer examination, a certain system can be found. For example, the common movement of star clusters, where each cluster often moves at the same speed in the same direction in space, like a flock of birds heading towards a distant destination. Star clusters and nebulae often approach or move away from our Milky Way galaxy at considerable speeds. These movements require astronomers to study, which is beyond the scope of our discussion today. Additionally, there is a type of fixed star called a binary star, where the two stars are very close to each other. To the naked eye, they appear as one, but through a telescope, they are seen as two. Sometimes, they appear as one through a small telescope but as two through a large telescope. The movement of these binary stars is the same as that of ordinary fixed stars, except that in some cases, one star orbits the other. It is now known that there are over 20,000 pairs of binary stars.</p>
<p>In short, celestial bodies in the solar system are the closest stars to us, so we can easily observe their movement. As for the movement of fixed stars, it is not noticeable to the average person in a short period of time due to their great distance from us. This belongs to specialized knowledge and requires astronomers to study. The above has explained how the sun, moon, and stars move. Now, I will explain the various phenomena resulting from their movement. The common phenomena that we see are the phases of the moon, solar and lunar eclipses, and the change of seasons. Other phenomena, such as the transit of Mercury and Venus across the sun's surface and lunar occultation of stars, are more specialized and will not be discussed for now. As for the rising and setting of the sun, moon, and stars, that is due to the earth's rotation and is not related to their movement.</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about the phases of the moon. What are the phases of the moon? As everyone knows, this is a phenomenon of the moon that we see from Earth. We know that on the first day of the lunar month, the moon is completely invisible. This is called the new moon (朔). After two or three days, we gradually see a crescent moon. After four or five days, we see half of the moon, which is called the first quarter (上弦). After another seven or eight days, we can see the full moon, which is called the full moon (望). Afterwards, it gradually wanes, and after another seven or eight days, we can only see half of it, which is called the last quarter (下弦). After another seven or eight days, it becomes completely invisible again, returning to the new moon. The lunar calendar is based on the time it takes for the moon to go through one cycle of phases.</p>
<p>But why does the moon have phases? This is due to the movement of the sun and moon. We already know that the Earth orbits the sun, and the moon orbits the Earth. As mentioned above, the time it takes for the moon to orbit the Earth is 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, and 11 seconds. If the Earth were stationary, then the length of a month would naturally be this number. But in reality, the Earth is constantly orbiting the sun and is not stationary, so the actual time it takes for the moon to orbit the Earth is more than 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes, and 11 seconds, but rather 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 3 seconds. Also, the moon itself does not have light; the light we see is sunlight reflected off its surface. Therefore, the changes in the moon's brightness, which are the phases of the moon, completely depend on the positions of the Earth, the sun, and the moon. When the sun, Earth, and moon are in a straight line, and the moon is between the sun and the Earth, we on Earth can only see its back side, so it is dark and invisible, which is called the new moon. After a little over seven days from the new moon, the sun and moon are 90 degrees apart, and we can gradually see half of it, with the light shining to the west, which is called the first quarter. After another seven or eight days, the moon is 180 degrees from the sun, with the Earth in between, and the sun and moon are directly opposite each other. We on Earth can see its front side, so it is fully illuminated, which is called the full moon. After another seven or eight days, the moon is again 90 degrees from the sun, and we can only see half of it, with the light shining to the east, which is called the last quarter. Afterwards, it gradually gets closer to the sun, and when it is between the sun and the Earth, it becomes completely dark, returning to the new moon.</p>
<p>As a result of the Earth and moon's movement, we see the phases of the moon. The orbits of the inner planets are inside the Earth's orbit. When we look at them from Earth, they also have phases. That is, the shapes of Mercury and Venus also have various changes, similar to the moon. Finally, I want to clarify one thing, which is that the new moons and full moons listed in the almanac published by the government refer to the waxing and waning of the moon. That is, the new moon is called "朔" (shuo), and the full moon is called "望" (wang), and it doesn't mean that shuo is the first day of the lunar calendar, and wang is the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar. Every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the dates in the almanac published by the government often differ by one or two days from the Mid-Autumn Festival used privately by the people. They often think that it is an error in the almanac, but in fact, it is not an error. The reason is a fundamental difference in meaning, because in the past, the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month was considered the Mid-Autumn Festival. After switching to the solar calendar, the government, in order to cater to the entertainment and rest of the general public, moved the Mid-Autumn Festival, Double Ninth Festival, and other festivals to the solar calendar. However, it is not based on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month as the Mid-Autumn Festival, but on the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox as the Mid-Autumn Festival. Therefore, there is a difference of one or two days from the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about solar and lunar eclipses. The principle of solar and lunar eclipses is very simple. Now, let me give you an example. At night, when we turn on an electric light, the whole room is bright. Suppose we take two balls of different sizes and put them under the electric light, then there will definitely be two shadows on the ground or wall. In the area of these shadows, we cannot see the light. Now, let's suppose we hold the small ball in one hand and the large ball in the other and put them both under the electric light. If the small and large balls and the electric light are in a straight line, then the shadow of one ball will definitely be cast on the other ball. For example, if the small ball is between the electric light and the large ball, then in the area of the small ball's shadow on the large ball, we will not be able to see the electric light. If we put the large ball between the electric light and the small ball, then if the large ball's shadow is directly cast on the small ball, then we will definitely see the small ball as dark and without light. The cause of solar and lunar eclipses is the same as this principle. We already know that the moon and Earth themselves do not have light; they are bright by reflecting sunlight. We also know that the Earth orbits the sun, and the moon orbits the Earth. Sometimes, the moon happens to be between the sun and the Earth. Sometimes, the moon and sun are on opposite sides of the Earth. Now, let's assume that the electric light mentioned above is the sun, the small ball is the moon, and the large ball is the Earth. Then, when the moon is between the sun and the Earth, the shadow of the sun cast by the moon reaches the ground. If we are in a place where the shadow reaches the ground, we will either not be able to see the sun or we will only see part of the sun, and this is where the phenomenon of a solar eclipse occurs. If the Earth is between the sun and the moon, and the shadow cast by the sun on the Earth happens to be directly on the moon, then we will definitely not be able to see the light of the moon, and this is where the phenomenon of a lunar eclipse occurs. Because of the relationship between the positions of the sun, moon, and Earth, solar and lunar eclipses have various different phenomena, that is, solar eclipses have three types: total eclipse, partial eclipse, and annular eclipse. Lunar eclipses only have two types: total eclipse and partial eclipse. Anything where the sun or moon is completely eclipsed is called a total eclipse. Anything where part of the sun or moon is eclipsed is called a partial eclipse. Because the moon's volume is smaller than the sun's, it sometimes cannot block the entire sun and can only block the center, leaving a ring of light around it. This is called an annular eclipse.</p>
<p>From what has been said above, we already know that the phenomenon of solar and lunar eclipses in the sky is only due to the relationship between the positions of the Earth, moon, and sun when they move into a straight line. However, there is a big difference between solar and lunar eclipses. That is, during a lunar eclipse, the entire or part of the moon's surface is inside the Earth's shadow, so the same lunar eclipse can be seen at any location or even outside the Earth. However, this is not the case for solar eclipses. A solar eclipse can only be seen by people on the ground where the cone of the moon's shadow reaches, and the solar eclipse seen varies from place to place depending on the depth of the cone of the moon's shadow. It is truly what is called "move a step, change the shape," so the calculation of lunar eclipses is much simpler than that of solar eclipses.</p>
<p>We already know that the moon is between the sun and the Earth during the new moon and the Earth is between the sun and the moon during the full moon. Therefore, solar eclipses must occur during the new moon, and lunar eclipses must occur during the full moon. We already know that the Earth orbits the sun, one revolution a year, and its orbit projected onto the celestial sphere is called the ecliptic. The moon orbits the Earth, one revolution a month, and its orbit is called the lunar orbit. If the ecliptic and lunar orbit were the same, then a solar eclipse would definitely occur every new moon, and a lunar eclipse would definitely occur every full moon. However, the ecliptic and lunar orbit are not the same; they are inclined to each other, and their angle of inclination is five degrees. Therefore, even if the moon is between the sun and the Earth during the new moon, or the Earth is between the sun and the moon during the full moon, if the latitudes are not the same, eclipses will still not occur. Therefore, although solar and lunar eclipses must occur during the new and full moon, they do not necessarily occur every new and full moon.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Incident of Japanese Marine Soldier Shot <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Victim Died Yesterday Morning, Perpetrator Still Being Investigated</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sergeant Major Hideo Nakayama of the Japanese Marine Corps was shot on Douleran Road, in front of house number 209, around 9:10 p.m. the night before. The bullet entered the back of his head and exited through his brain, causing him to fall to the ground immediately. He was rushed to the Japanese Naval Hospital for treatment but succumbed to his injuries at 1:10 a.m. yesterday morning. Hu Hexiang, a worker at the Gaogang Shoe Store, witnessed the incident and is considered a witness in the case. He is currently being held at the Dixwell Road Police Station. Hu Hexiang, a native of Changzhou, works as a shoemaker at the Gaogang Shoe Store, which is located on Douleran Road. He went to the store around 9 p.m. the night before to collect his wages. As Hu Hexiang was about to step into the store, he suddenly heard a gunshot. Hu turned around and saw a person wearing a black Western suit fleeing from Fengerli towards North Sichuan Road. However, due to the dim streetlights at the time, he was unable to clearly identify the fleeing person's face. At the same time, Hu also saw another person lying on the ground. In a state of panic, he immediately ran into the store and, together with the Japanese store owner, went outside to check. They found that the injured person lying on the ground was a Japanese Marine soldier. They immediately reported the incident to the police. The location of the incident was found to be on an extra-territorial road, which connects North Sichuan Road to the east, Yokohama Road to the west, and Jiangwan Road to the north. After the incident, the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters immediately notified the Dixwell Road Police Station and the North Station Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting them to investigate and apprehend the perpetrator. Inspector-General Wang Dasui of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and Branch Chief Liang Fuchu of the North Station Branch led police officers to search pedestrians in the nearby area and arrest the perpetrator. At the same time, the police found a bullet casing on Douleran Road and a Spanish-made .32 caliber automatic pistol, which the perpetrator had abandoned at the entrance of Fengerli. All items are currently held at the Dixwell Road Police Station. The perpetrator has fled and is being actively pursued. The Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters dispatched Staff Officer Yasuda to visit Branch Chief Liang Fuchu of the North Station Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau around 10 a.m. on the 10th, requesting assistance in investigating and apprehending the perpetrator. Director Cai Jingjun of the Municipal Public Security Bureau also dispatched Inspector-General Wang Dasui, accompanied by Liang Fuchu, to visit Mr. Araki, the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps, around 10:30 a.m. on the 10th, to express his condolences. This morning's news indicates that the guard posts set up by Japanese soldiers in the area north of Yokohama Bridge have been removed.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Polish Independence Day Celebration <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Held at the Catholic Church Yesterday Morning, Polish Envoy Awards Medals to Three Overseas Compatriots</p>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Poland's regained independence. The Polish embassy and consulates in Shanghai, as well as other institutions, are closed for the holiday as usual. Yesterday morning at 9:30 a.m., all Polish officials and citizens residing in Shanghai held a religious celebration at the Catholic Church on Avenue Ste. Marie. Polish Envoy Wiedenfeld and his wife, the Polish Consul, Greczynski, and several hundred others attended. The event concluded at 11 a.m. In the afternoon, at 4 p.m., the Polish community in Shanghai held a celebration for Independence Day at the Catholic Club on Avenue Ste. Marie. Mrs. Wiedenfeld, the wife of the Polish Envoy, gave a speech, and Envoy Wiedenfeld awarded honorary medals to three overseas compatriots for their contributions. The ceremony was very solemn. Poland was founded in 990 A.D. and was extremely powerful in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1772, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland for the first time, causing great turmoil. This was followed by the second and third partitions, and by 1795, the nation had unfortunately ceased to exist. Patriotic individuals launched repeated revolutions, but they all failed. With the outbreak of the European War, Polish patriots rose up to strive for a revival movement, forming secret military organizations. Under the leadership of the national hero General Pilsudski, they resisted Russia and fought for Polish independence, achieving successive victories. Later, when Germany and Austria sought to utilize the volunteer army led by Pilsudski, he refused. In 1917, he was imprisoned by the German government in a military prison. In 1918, the European War ended, and Pilsudski was released. On November 10th of that year, he returned to Warsaw amidst the cheers of the masses. The following day, a provisional government was established. Poland, which had been in decline for over a century, finally regained its independence and freedom. Today marks the 17th anniversary of this event. Poland has become increasingly prosperous, and General Pilsudski, who created the Polish revival, has passed away, but his fame is intertwined with Poland and will be immortalized and admired by future generations.</p>

According to Franco himself, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, he is now scheduled to take a direct steamer to Japan on the 16th to take up his new post. All the transfer procedures have been completed, so there is no need for him to return to his home country. Having lived in China for many years, he has enjoyed harmonious relations with Chinese officials, citizens, and people from all walks of life, and has made many Chinese friends. Now that he has been ordered to transfer, he feels quite nostalgic upon leaving. He is very interested in China's various construction and revival movements and is very pleased to see that they are gradually succeeding.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Simple Aviation Exhibition Opened Yesterday Morning <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>More Than 30,000 Visitors</p>
<p>The simple aviation exhibition organized by the China Aviation Association to promote national salvation through aviation opened yesterday morning (the 10th) at the Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. The exhibition venue has two sections. One is a large wooden shed on the open space in front, in the center of which is a Jiang Feng aircraft, painted silver and strikingly beautiful. The names of the various parts and the sequence of manufacturing the wings are clearly indicated with white arrow signs on a blue background. To the west of the shed, five floats made entirely of domestic fir wood are displayed, forming a complete wooden float, all with clear explanations so that viewers can easily understand. To the north, a V-shaped water-cooled aircraft engine and a Y-shaped air-cooled aircraft engine that has been dissected are displayed. The internal names are also clearly marked with small red arrows. To the west, a fire engine manufactured by the Zhendan Fire Extinguisher Factory is parked to prevent accidents. Two police officers are stationed inside the shed to maintain order. The third exhibition room is located in the courtyard of the Chongsheng Temple in the Hou Dai area. A square wooden structure has been built, decorated with large-scale colored paintings that are startling to the mind. Below are statistical charts related to the aviation industry. Next to the pavilion are photographs of various projects from the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department. The four gates form the exhibition hall, which is square. Wooden cabinets are built along the four walls, covered with blue cloth. Various aircraft models, various types of lighting, various aircraft machine guns, formations of aircraft from various countries, and photographs of parachute airfields are placed on the cloth. Hanging on the walls are photographs about the establishment of the Aviation Association and the public's donation of aircraft. In the center, in front of a square wooden platform, is an amphibious bomber, with explanations marked with colored ribbons. At the rear is a general overview of the association's new clubhouse and exhibition hall models. The entire layout is well-organized, and people from all walks of life are shoulder to shoulder, crowding the venue. It is estimated that there were more than 30,000 visitors.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Second Day of Scouting Fundraising <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Internal Fundraising Begins Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Joint Relief Association for Victims of Disasters in Various Provinces, in view of the widespread suffering and dire conditions in various regions, especially with the approaching winter, which makes the situation even more severe, decided to provide relief to alleviate the rural crisis and help disaster victims survive. With the consent of the Shanghai Scouting Council, a city-wide scouting fundraising campaign was launched to provide relief, with Li Dachao of the Disaster Relief Association and the directors of the Scouting Council responsible for the campaign. After days of preparation, the general mobilization began yesterday, with 6,000 scouts across the city going to designated locations in the morning to solicit donations from various businesses, organizations, and recreational venues. Yesterday was Sunday, and the scouts continued their fundraising efforts on the streets and alleys as planned, which was very common. Chinese-owned buses and trams were given special permission to provide free rides for fundraising. The busiest areas of the city were particularly concentrated with scouts. They politely and earnestly pleaded with people to donate generously to help the disaster victims. People from all walks of life, aware of the severity of the disaster, already had compassion in their hearts. Seeing the young age of the scouts and their energetic spirit of running around, they were generally willing to contribute out of respect. Yesterday, on a public bus, two scouts, who were very young, did not have money with them. They thought that since they were serving the disaster victims, they should not have to pay for tickets. The ticket sellers generally did not have any problems with this, but there were occasional Western ticket inspectors who were very strict. The scouts were embarrassed by the Western ticket inspectors, but the passengers on the bus, mostly our compatriots, could not bear to see the scouts in such a predicament and stepped forward to help them. The enthusiasm of our compatriots is commendable. In the past two days, the scouts, while being sincere and polite, also displayed their energetic and valiant spirit. Many people were moved by their words, and some even helped them solicit donations. Last night, in front of a dance hall, three scouts stopped a car. The scouts said to the male and female occupants of the car, "Sir, this year there have been floods in various parts of the country, and countless compatriots have nothing to eat or wear. Now the dance hall will not let us in. Please donate something here." The people in the car then took out a ten-dollar bill and went into the dance hall. Dance halls are places where people spend money and waste time, which does not benefit society. At a time when the country is facing frequent disasters and widespread suffering, all our compatriots should do their best to help the victims of the disasters. Dance halls should also provide assistance. The scouts have worked very hard for the past two days to help the disaster victims. The scouts, wearing their thin uniforms, were still soliciting donations on the streets at midnight. Their spirit of righteousness and courage is admirable. Tong Xingbai and Leng Xueqiao, the executive directors of the Scouting Council, have also been inspecting the situation in the field for the past few days. The results of the past two days have been quite good. The fundraising on the streets ended last night, and internal fundraising begins today. The temporary office of the Youth Association was also closed last night. Scouting troops participating in the fundraising can still contact the Scouting Council on Dajilu Road from today onwards. The donations collected by the various troops in the past two days should also be submitted to the council today. The council has designated the 11th, 12th, 15th, and 18th as the four days for collecting donations, with the deadline being 4 p.m. each day. In addition, Mr. Gu Zhiyong of the Juchang Pavilion on Simalu Road found a donation book and helped donate one dollar. The council has sent a letter to retrieve the donation ticket and express its gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e79">This Office Received Disaster Relief Donations Yesterday <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>

<h3 id="e80">Cotton Production Greatly Increased <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Efforts of the Cotton Industry Control Committee</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, attention has been paid to cotton seeds throughout the country, so the output in various regions has greatly increased compared to before. According to recent statistics in the business community, China's cotton production is very small, and the dependence on foreign cotton over the years has led to a huge outflow of money, which is shocking. In the past one or two years, thanks to the vigorous promotion of the Cotton Industry Control Committee and the guidance of farmers to improve cotton seeds, the output has greatly increased compared to before, and the area of cotton planting in various provinces has also expanded. It is expected that in five years, the annual increase in cotton production will be more than 40 million bales, so that it will no longer be necessary to rely on foreign cotton, which is of great importance to the social economy.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Xu Xiaochu first reported: "Today, the National Association of New Pharmaceutical Industry is holding its inaugural ceremony. We are very honored to have representatives from higher-level agencies and leaders from all walks of life to attend and give guidance. The new pharmaceutical industry has only been in China for about 50 years, and its development has only been in the last 30 years. The government's establishment of a special department to manage it only came after the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. As of today, according to investigations, only 24 places meet the requirements of Article 5 of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, which states that more than seven companies can organize an industry association. As a result, when accidents occur between companies in the same industry, they often feel scattered and powerless. Whenever the health authorities have facilities, they also lack opinions. As a result, the promotion of the business often faces many obstacles, and it is difficult to maintain cohesion between superiors and subordinates. With the daily progress of science and the flourishing of medicine, we feel that the responsibilities of the new pharmaceutical industry are heavy, and the need for communication and unity is urgent. Therefore, last autumn, the new pharmaceutical industry associations of Nanjing, Hankou, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai jointly initiated the preparation of the federation, applied for approval from the local highest party department in accordance with the law, and actively carried it out. It was not until today that we were able to hold the inauguration ceremony. We sincerely hope that representatives from all regions will uphold the sincerity of one heart and one mind, jointly plan the development of the industry, be committed to the purpose of professional ethics and community, and strive to strengthen unity. The industry is fortunate, and it is also the blessing of the country and society. The details of the preparations will be reported separately, so I will not repeat them."</p>
<p>Preparations</p>
<p>Next, Xu Chao reported on the preparations, saying: "This association was initiated in July last year. First, at the meeting of member representatives of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Xu Xiaochu, the representative of Zhongfa Pharmacy, proposed that although the new pharmaceutical industry associations of various provinces and cities usually have official documents, there is no joint office and it is not enough to unite their spirits. He advocated organizing the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to connect with each other. After being approved on the spot, he sought the opinions of the new pharmaceutical industry associations of Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Hankou, Kaifeng, Zhenjiang, and other places. They all replied in agreement and recommended Zhou Shiluo, Ding Jianting, Zhao Shengbin, Yuan Fengzhou, and Nuo Jun to come to Shanghai to participate in the launch meeting, and asked the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department to approve it early. Xu Xiaochu, Sun Deyao, Zhao Shengbin, Huang Yusheng, Xiang Runquan, Ding Jianting, Yuan Hesong, Zhou Bangjun, Zhu Yuquan, Xu Chao, Xu Xiangsun, and other 11 people were designated as members of the preparatory committee, and Xu Xiaochu was mutually elected as the director of the preparatory committee, and Zhou Bangjun and Yuan Hesong. As deputy directors, they were responsible for carrying out the work. A part of the remaining rooms of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association were used to formally establish the preparatory office. The preparatory committee meetings were convened three times successively, the draft of the articles of association and the application form for membership were drafted, and the graphic logo was published, and submitted to the party and government agencies for filing for record to show solemnity. At present, the new pharmaceutical industry associations of various provinces and cities have filled in the application form and recommended representatives. There are 22 provinces and cities that have formally joined, which has exceeded two-thirds of the national industry organizations. There are also 24 stores that have joined because there are no industry or no industry association organizations in other places, or although there are industry associations, they are not organized. On the opening day of the representative conference, I will summarize the preparations as above.</p>
<p>Adoption of the Articles of Association</p>
<p>Then, representatives from various circles delivered speeches. (1) Zhu Yangwu, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, said in his speech, "The establishment of a group should first improve its organization in order to seek happiness for members and society. Today, your association has gathered colleagues from various provinces, cities, and counties to hold its inaugural meeting here. I am very happy to participate in the grand event. I hope that you will work hard to consolidate the spirit of mutual assistance in the industry." (2) Li Zhensheng of the Ministry of Health said in his speech, "After examining the existing new pharmaceutical associations across the country, I found that they have not been established. Your association is working to seek the happiness of the industry and initiate the establishment of a federation. I hope that the members of your association will adhere to the spirit of unity to strengthen the association and benefit development." Next, Zhong Ziqi of the Health Bureau, Hu Xiyuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Xu Naili of the National Medical Association, and Wang Yansong spoke successively. At noon, the four pharmacies, including Zhongying, Huamei, Dazhong, and Wenhua, hosted a public banquet at the Youth Association on Sichuan Road.</p>
<p>Election of Executives and Supervisors</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the meeting continued to discuss and adopt the articles of association, and then began to elect the executives and supervisors. The results were as follows: (Executive Committee) Xu Xiaochu, 99 votes; Zhou Bangjun, 97 votes; Yuan Hesong, 103 votes; Zhu Yuquan, 90 votes; Chen Xingwu, 80 votes; Xu Xiangsun, 97 votes; Tu Kaizheng, 95 votes; Xu Chao, 90 votes; Ding Jianting, 73 votes; Sun Deyao, 83 votes; Zhao Shengbin, 82 votes; Xie Younan, 69 votes; Hu Zhaoxiang, 62 votes; Wu Shaojiu, 26 votes; (Alternate Executive Committee) Xiang Kaiquan, Fan Wenwei, Gao Peiliang, Huang Yusheng, Chen Shenghai, Zheng Runlin, Peng Zhongyi; (Supervisory Committee) Zhu Ruichen, 66 votes; Yuan Feng votes; Xiang Shengwu, 63 votes; Zhou Mengbai, 61 votes; Luo Bowen, 58 votes; (Alternate Supervisory Committee) Liu Yanchen, Ma Xinquan, Zhang Bolin. The association originally scheduled the meeting for yesterday, but due to the short time and the large number of proposals (44 in total), it was decided to postpone it for one day to allow for a thorough discussion. Chu Minyi, the representative of the Executive Yuan, will also attend and give guidance today. The following is the text of Chu's telegram to Xu Xiaochu yesterday: Xu Xiaochu, Zhongfa Pharmacy, Beijing Road, Shanghai, I have received your telegram and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 11th). If there is a meeting on that day, I can still participate. Chu Minyi Qing.</p>

<h3 id="e85">General Labor Union Petitions the Fifth Plenary Session to Properly Plan Relief Measures for Unemployment <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Unemployed Workers Wander and Strive for a Living Without a Way Out; Requesting Deliberation on Fundamental Solutions and Implementation of Relief</p>
<p>The General Labor Union of this city notes that since the market has declined, industry and commerce have withered, and the number of unemployed workers has increased sharply. They wander and strive for a living without a way out. Yesterday, they submitted a petition to the Fifth Plenary Session, requesting proper deliberation on relief measures. The original text reads: "Petition regarding the withering of industry and commerce, increased unemployment, requesting proper planning of measures, implementation of relief, to secure the people's livelihood and relieve their suffering. Our country has been affected by the global recession in recent years, which has brought the rural economy to the brink of bankruptcy, and industry and commerce are in extreme decline. The arrogance and devastation of the Red Bandits and the mutual torment of disasters have led to a further decline in the people's purchasing power and a tightening of domestic currency. Commercial difficulties are extremely severe, and many feel unable to sustain themselves. Bankruptcies and closures are heard of daily. Even those who can barely maintain themselves are reducing staff and cutting personnel, striving for austerity. As a result, the number of unemployed workers has increased sharply, wandering and striving for a living without a way out. With the severe cold approaching, if relief is not quickly planned, the impact will inevitably lead to social unrest. The association witnesses this with heartache and has repeatedly appealed to the government for relief, but has not yet received proper and practical measures. Now, the Fifth Plenary Session is opening in Beijing, gathering the nation's elite in one hall. Great plans and schemes will surely benefit the country and the people. We dare to submit this petition to your esteemed session, requesting proper deliberation on fundamental solutions, providing practical relief to unemployed workers, and ordering all competent authorities to be responsible for implementation, to secure the people's livelihood and relieve their suffering. We are extremely urgent in submitting this petition." Zhu Xuefan, Chairman, Li Mengnan, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xiangzui, Long Peiyun, and Shao Xubai, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Ministry of Finance Approves Methods for Affixing Stamp Tax Stamps <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently approved the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's methods for affixing stamp tax stamps: "Internal documents compiled into a volume should be affixed with stamps." The approval reads: "Your telegram has been received. Internal documents and internal ledgers are both related to business operations. Since the ledger should be affixed with stamps, internal documents should also be affixed accordingly. However, these documents are complex and numerous. If each is required to be affixed with stamps, merchants will inevitably bear an excessive burden. The Stamp Tax Law grants exemptions to show consideration for merchants. These exempt documents are discarded immediately after use and do not pose a problem. If there is a need to compile and store them, they serve the purpose of verifying accounts like ledgers used for business. Therefore, they should be handled in accordance with Article 11 of the Implementing Regulations. If these documents can be legally exempted from stamps when used individually, but not be affixed with stamps as ledgers after being compiled into a volume, all store ledgers will be changed to the document format in the future, and compiled into a volume at the end of the month or year to avoid paying taxes. Then, the 'business ledgers' listed in the tax rate table of Article 16 of the Stamp Tax Law would be equivalent to a mere formality. The Ministry has previously instructed that internal documents compiled into a volume should still be affixed with stamps according to ledger regulations to prevent this abuse. Please inform accordingly." This approval relates to (2) "Delivery slips should be affixed with stamps as invoices." The approval reads: "Your telegram and attachments have been received. It is impossible for any third party other than the delivery store and the customer to know whether a delivery for viewing results in a transaction, or whether an invoice is issued separately after the transaction. Upon inspection, the delivery slips used by the Shanghai medicinal materials industry are essentially disguised invoices and should be affixed with stamps in accordance with the law. As for reconciliation statements, according to the latter half of Article 5 of the Stamp Tax Law Implementing Regulations, they should be issued to corresponding accounts at the end of each month or year to verify whether there are errors in the amount of receipts and payments. The sample reconciliation statement attached to the telegram does not indicate whether the content only lists the amount of receipts and payments, or whether it is used for other purposes, making it difficult to determine. It is difficult to recognize as a reconciliation statement. Please inform accordingly."</p>

<p>The Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held its fourth plenary committee meeting at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday in the meeting room on the third floor of the chamber. Over fifty committee members attended, including Wang Yansong, Xu Jiguang, Chen Zeqing, Xu Yongzuo, Jin Guobao, Ke Ganchen, Xu Peikun, Xi Yushu, Pan Yangyao, Zheng Chengqing, Yan E'sheng, Gao Shiheng, and Ma Jiliang. The meeting was chaired by Chairman Wang Yansong. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Discussion and Resolution of Various Proposals</p>
<p>The meeting began with an address by the chairman, stating that today is the fourth meeting of the committee, and the government has now announced and implemented the currency reform proposal requested and expected by industry and commerce. This proves the government's concern for industry and commerce and its respect for public opinion. The panic of silver outflow and increased trade deficit can be eliminated or reduced. The industrial and commercial sectors and the general public should support this. In addition to respecting the law, we must strive for production. The committee is an organization that provides opinions. The opinions previously contributed have been adopted by the Ministries of Finance and Industry and the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee. In the future, we should gather opinions from all parties and formulate opinions on reviving industry and commerce based on the new currency law, and contribute them to the government. Next, Yan E'sheng, director of the General Affairs Group, reported that after the committee passed the report on increasing collateral, it sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting the Ministries of Finance and Industry to adopt it. Later, it received notifications from the Ministry of Industry (Shang Zi No. 3729) and the Ministry of Finance (Qian Zi No. 7520), and sent the original opinion letter to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Trust Bureau for review. The Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee established by the government in Shanghai has adopted some of the proposals in the report and will change the planned three million yuan loan for industrial and commercial operations to commercial acceptance drafts. Next, Pan Yangyao, deputy director of the Training Group, reported on the process of drafting the "Guidelines for the Management of Industrial and Commercial Organizations." Next, Ren Jinping, the executive director, reported on the establishment of a practical problems research class for industry and commerce, stating that the committee members believe that the lack of a sound organization is a major cause of the decline in industry and commerce. Therefore, the Training Group decided to jointly run the practical problems research class for industry and commerce with the Chamber of Commerce's commercial night school. Three classes were established first: industrial and commercial management, industrial and commercial accounting, and product promotion. Experts were invited to serve as lecturers. Classes started on the 28th of last month, with a total of 199 students, an increase of one-third over the original number, which is very optimistic. Among the students, many have a middle school diploma, and some hold director positions in industrial and commercial organizations, and there are even inquiries from other cities. Next, Xi Yushu, director of the Investigation Group, reported that at the third general meeting, investigation forms had been received from 16 industries. As of today, investigation forms have been received from 32 industries. Next, the proposed "Guidelines for the Management of Industrial and Commercial Organizations" were discussed and passed by the general meeting. Next, opinions on actively providing government relief to industry and commerce were discussed. Gao Shiheng, Pan Yangyao, and other committee members expressed their opinions. After discussion, it was decided to transfer the matter to the subcommittee, adopt opinions from all parties, prepare a report, and submit it to the next general meeting for discussion and passage. Then, it will be forwarded to the government by the Chamber of Commerce. Finally, it was discussed that the government already has fundamental solutions to the collateral problem and will further control foreign exchange and trade. The revival of industry and commerce will not be difficult to gradually realize. The committee was originally scheduled to operate for six months, but now it can be concluded early. The meeting discussed the conclusion of the committee's term and decided to send a letter from the committee to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, setting a date for the conclusion. Unfinished matters will be continued by the relevant departments of the Chamber of Commerce. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Guidelines for the Management of Industrial and Commercial Organizations</p>
<p>The original text of the "Guidelines for the Management of Industrial and Commercial Organizations" passed by the committee is as follows: From an economic point of view, there are three major factors of production: capital, land, and labor. To replace them with more common terms, land is raw materials, because land is the source of raw materials, labor is all management, because all production activities are labor, and capital, raw materials, and management are all indispensable for production. But in comparison, management seems to occupy the most important position, because capital and raw materials are inactive substances that cannot be used without management. The appropriateness of management can increase or decrease the effectiveness of capital and raw materials. Industrial and commercial management is an extremely complex term, including many items. If classified, it can be divided into accounting management, production management, administrative management, personnel management, etc. If these types of management are studied, each can become a specialized discipline. However, based on the situation of industrial and commercial enterprises in our country, there are several items in these aspects of management that deserve special attention and should be studied first. Therefore, we briefly propose several important principles for reference. Regarding accounting, the committee has already drafted "Instructions for Final Accounts." Here, we only select the most important aspects of production, administration, and personnel management that are urgently needed by industry and commerce in our country, and propose them as follows: (1) Production methods should be thoroughly researched. Most industrial and commercial enterprises in our country only know how to adopt or imitate foreign machinery or methods to carry out production work. The best results are the same as existing foreign products, and the worst results need not be mentioned. However, foreigners are constantly researching and improving the machinery and methods they use, which is beyond the reach of industrial and commercial enterprises in our country that adhere to established rules. Therefore, products in our country are often unable to compete with foreign goods. Industrial and commercial enterprises in our country should constantly conduct spiritual research and analysis of the machinery and methods they use, strive to save raw materials and time, and improve the finished products of machinery. This kind of research requires the use of specialized talent and cannot be handled by ordinary knowledge. (2) Standards for finished products should be established. The products of European and American countries can gain the trust of users because they have definite standards. The quality of the products and other standards of a manufacturer are always the same. The products of the industrial sector in our country often do not have fixed standards. Today's products may be different from tomorrow's products, and for various reasons, there are often deliberate changes in standards. This situation is extremely detrimental to sales and has an extremely unfavorable impact on the progress of the entire industry and commerce. Therefore, in the future, strict standards should be established for finished products based on research on raw materials, machinery, methods, market needs, and customer psychology. (3) The amount of production should be based on statistics. The amount of finished products manufactured in industry and the amount of goods sold in commerce cannot be guessed or estimated, but should be calculated based on actual sales conditions. With accurate calculations, the overall production in industry and the overall procurement in commerce can have a comprehensive plan. With a comprehensive plan, the profit and loss of business can be calculated clearly. Industrial and commercial enterprises in our country often have no basis for the amount of production and are entirely at the discretion of the responsible person's subjective views. Even if there is a slight basis, it is mostly a hasty estimate. It can be said that there are very few who use accurate calculations to control production. Therefore, supply and demand cannot be adjusted, production is affected, and business suffers losses. Therefore, the amount of production must be based on statistics to seek accuracy. (4) Administrative matters should avoid backlog. Administrative matters other than production in industrial and commercial organizations, such as documents, accounting, and general affairs, often have the bad habit of backlog. Things cannot be completed on the same day. This situation is not limited to one reason, whether due to poor organization, unclear procedures, or poor psychology. But whatever the reason, this situation should be completely eliminated, because backlog not only directly hinders the progress of affairs, but also has an adverse psychological effect on the people who work, which can increase the power of this bad habit and greatly reduce efficiency. Therefore, all affairs should be based on the principle of "one day's affairs, one day's completion." (5) Procedures and forms should be centrally designed. In all kinds of organizations, there are many procedures in administrative matters. The implementation of these procedures inevitably requires the use of various forms. These procedures and forms are naturally not all generated at the same time, but are added at any time according to needs. For this reason, they often have no system and have many repetitive places. In terms of affairs, it is not economical and can easily cause various obstacles and abuses. Therefore, the various procedures and application forms of an organization, although they can be added or changed at any time, should be centrally managed in the design to plan comprehensively, seek continuity, stipulate priorities, and reduce duplication. This can increase the efficiency of the entire affair. (6) Office premises should be rationally set up. The layout inside the office premises of general organizations is often uncertain and lacks organization. In the case of office rooms, related parts are often separated too far. In the case of offices, each person's position is often chaotic. Even if the distance is suitable, there are not many cases where other supplies and furniture can be placed properly. This situation may seem unimportant on the surface, but it actually has a great impact on the efficiency of affairs. Because appropriate settings can reduce much unnecessary labor and time, and can also make the spirit comfortable and increase the concept of clarity in dealing with things. Therefore, all kinds of organizations should have reasonable settings for the places where they handle affairs. (7) The employment of workers should be based on rational selection. It is a recognized phenomenon that the employment of people in various undertakings in our country is not on the right track. Industry and commerce are no exception. People employed due to private relationships, favors, or family ties are often incompetent, and sometimes adverse phenomena occur. In an organization, various jobs require different things, and people in society all have different points in terms of ability, knowledge, interest, and experience. What kind of person should do what, must be determined after careful study of both parties. Industrial and commercial organizations that want to succeed must, for the people they use, regardless of size, be based on needs and detailed examination in order to achieve maximum effectiveness. As for the methods of selection, they must be based on facts, meet needs, and specify standards using scientific methods. (8) New employees should be trained. No matter how educational institutions try to adapt to the needs of industry and commerce, they strive for universality, but they may not be able to supply the special needs of each organization. Because each organization has its own history, organization, characteristics, etc., which cannot be completely included in the teaching materials of educational institutions. Therefore, new employees, although they may be competent in basic abilities, still need to adapt to the special places in the organization. Training is to reduce the unsuitable situation for new employees in the shortest period of time and increase work efficiency. All industrial and commercial organizations should plan training procedures for all high and low positions, making it a part of management work. (9) Rewards and punishments for workers should have fair standards. Both rewards and punishments have the effect of increasing efficiency. This is understood by general organizations, and most have implemented methods. However, the effectiveness of rewards and punishments lies in the fairness of implementation. Whether it is rewards such as bonuses or promotions, or punishments such as demerits or salary deductions, they can cause resentment and injustice among employees. This kind of situation not only cancels out the original intention, but also hinders the discipline of all employees. To seek fairness in rewards and punishments, there must be detailed and accurate methods for evaluating work results. Various jobs must have performance standards, and each person's work must have detailed records. Then, individuals can be compared with standards to obtain the basis for rewards and punishments. Therefore, to seek fairness in rewards and punishments, there must first be a method for evaluating results. (10) Employee benefits should be given as much attention as possible. Common people responsible for management believe that paying employees their salaries is the extent of their responsibility. This is an extremely short-sighted view, because it is not only salaries that can affect work. Everything related to life, such as diet, housing, medicine, education, hygiene, sports, and entertainment, can increase or decrease work efficiency. Therefore, industrial and commercial enterprises should also organize employee welfare undertakings as much as possible within their capacity, only thinking of their own interests. Try to ensure that employees are comfortable and stable in their lives and can do their best to work for the organization. In our society, special attention should be paid to employees' spare time to prevent the abuses that easily occur in many ordinary occupations. The above points are selected from the most important aspects of industrial and commercial management and those that urgently need to be implemented in industrial and commercial enterprises in our country. Although they cannot include all matters for reviving industry and commerce, if complete attention can be paid to these ten items and they are thoroughly implemented, at least industrial and commercial management can be brought into line, so that industry and commerce can proceed on the road to revival and achieve success easily.

Fifty percent of the creditors' debts will be allocated as preferred shares, and the remaining fifty percent will be repaid in installments six months after the resumption of business. The Shanghai branch creditors must vote on whether they approve of the resumption of business and the resumption plan proposed by the Hong Kong creditors. Please indicate whether you agree with the resumption of business and the above-mentioned resumption plan."</p>

According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency who inquired with the person in charge of the Shanghai branch, the Shanghai branch's capital of 2,574,100 yuan will be used as ordinary shares. The remaining 2,425,900 yuan will be added as Class B preferred shares, using half of the deposits of the bank's creditors. Then, the opinions of the old shareholders will be solicited to decide whether to raise new shares or for the old shareholders to increase their shares to raise five million yuan as Class A preferred shares. Each share is worth ten yuan. The interest rate for Class A shares is 5%, and for Class B shares is 4%. Ordinary shares have no official interest. Class A, Class B, and ordinary shares will be paid in sequence at a rate of 7%. The Shanghai branch will report to the headquarters after today's meeting to formulate a resumption plan and proceed with the resumption of business.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Zhang Sumin's Opinion on the New Currency System <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Economic scholar Dr. Zhang Qimin made a statement regarding the Ministry of Finance's announcement on the reform of the currency system, saying that, according to this announcement, our country has officially abandoned the silver standard and adopted managed currency, which coincides with his personal advocacy over the years, so he is very happy to hear it. Based on the financial and general economic conditions in recent years, the entire currency system and economy are trending towards total collapse. If our country does not break away from the silver standard, the silver standard will also break away from our country. Now, we are voluntarily abandoning the silver standard and clarifying the methods, which can not only increase prices, restore economic prosperity, but also promote export trade, attract foreign investment, and build the national economy. Although the salaried and wage-earning classes will suffer slightly from the rise in prices, the development of various industries and seeking other occupations can avoid the suffering of unemployment, which is enough to compensate for the loss. However, after abandoning the silver standard, many problems need to be solved urgently, such as (1) how to strictly prohibit and punish unscrupulous merchants from raising prices and hoarding goods, (2) how to immediately issue new subsidiary coins to compensate for the escape of silver dimes and should immediately buy up silver dimes, (3) what kind of effective methods should be adopted to buy up the cash hoarded by people in various places, (4) how to consult with the Japanese authorities to help prohibit the smuggling of silver in the Dalian and Shanhaiguan areas, (5) the government already has considerable methods to stabilize foreign exchange, but how to establish an independent large-scale foreign exchange balance fund for long-term planning, (6) how to expand and contract the issuance of banknotes and lower the silver content of silver dollars to wait for the establishment of a global currency system agreement and implement the gold exchange standard. All of these are issues that the financial authorities should pay urgent attention to. In short, the success of future matters depends entirely on proper management.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Overseas Chinese Youth Huang Agan Travels the World and Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Seven Years of Hardships</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that Huang Agan (transliteration), the 22-year-old son of an overseas Chinese man who planted rubber trees in the Straits Settlements, has traveled the world on a bicycle for seven years and has recently returned to Shanghai. Huang set off in 1928, traveling to various European countries, North Africa, India, and Siam. He claimed yesterday that he now intends to travel to various parts of his motherland before returning to his hometown of Malacca. When Huang was studying geography in school, he aspired to travel the world. He departed from Malacca, traveling north along the Malay Peninsula to Siam, then entering Myanmar, India, Balochistan, Persia, Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Bulgaria. When he arrived at the border of Yugoslavia, he was detained by guards who suspected him of being a spy. His hands were tied behind his back, and he was imprisoned for a month, receiving one pound of hard bread and one bowl of water per day, with no bedding, sleeping on the cement floor at night. Later, with the intervention of the British Consul, he was released and went to Vienna. A farmer generously took him in, and he lived in a cowshed for eight months, waiting for his confiscated bicycle to be returned. In Vienna, he joined the Haijingbo Circus as an assistant. He arrived in Germany in 1931 and stayed for eight months. German farmers provided him with daily necessities, and workers at the Cologne factory also helped him. They asked him many questions about China, but he could not tell them much except about the situation in British Malaya. He then entered France via Strasbourg and went to Dunkirk from Calais. He was detained by border guards because his bicycle did not have a license and he could not pay the tax. This time, with the help of the British Consul, who paid 50 francs on his behalf, he regained his freedom. He stayed in France for two months and took a boat to Dover, England, staying for four months. He relied heavily on the assistance of the priest Johnson. With the help of church funding, he was able to visit Northern Ireland and then returned to England, before visiting Germany again. He rejoined the Haijingbo Circus and performed in Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy, Sardinia, Sicily, and Malta. He also traveled to North Africa, Algeria, Tripoli, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Aden, and Oman. He then took a British oil tanker across the Persian Gulf and returned to Singapore. The journey was not always smooth. He stayed overnight in a police station in a town in Persia. When he woke up the next morning, he found that his luggage and bicycle were missing. The police station demanded a fee for the night, but he had no money to pay. Later, an Indian driver intervened, and he was able to avoid payment. The driver still demanded two tumans as a reward, but this was less than what the police station had demanded. He then rode his bicycle to Tehran, the capital of Persia, and was again assisted with a small amount of money by American missionaries and the British Consul. When he arrived at the Caspian Sea, the British Consul advised him not to risk entering Soviet Russia, so he changed his route to Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. The Arabs there carried long curved knives, which looked frightening. He then went to Syria and received help from the Armenians there. On his way to Turkey, he occasionally encountered motor transport teams who gave him food. All parts of Turkey presented a modern atmosphere. The municipal governments of all the places he passed gave him three liras as travel expenses. In March of this year, he returned to Siam from Europe, where he encountered an anti-Chinese movement and was stopped by the Siamese police, who demanded an entry fee of 100 yuan. He was taken to a certain place, and after arguing, he paid only one yuan and one jiao. He then went from Bangkok to Hong Kong, arriving there on March 21. He then walked along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to Guangzhou. Huang arrived in Shanghai in June of this year and traveled to various cities along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, receiving hospitality from Chen Shuren and members of the Central Party Headquarters. He now plans to continue traveling to various parts of the interior before returning home. Huang told a reporter from the Continental News yesterday that he now needs a bicycle. When he was in England, a company gave him one, but when he arrived in Liverpool, he abandoned it there because he had to pay customs duties. When he arrived in Guangzhou, it was difficult to meet Liu Jiwen. It is very difficult to meet dignitaries in China, and he really doesn't understand why. Often, his secretary would meet him instead, saying that the person was too busy to meet him in person.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Municipal Zoo Pigeon Research Association Holds Pigeon Race <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Starting from Changzhou, a Full Distance of 160 Li; The First Pigeon Arrived in Shanghai in Two Hours and Three Minutes; Full Results to be Announced in a Week</p>
<p>The first pigeon race organized by the Municipal Zoo Pigeon Research Association was held yesterday. The Datong News reporter inquired about the details as follows:</p>
<p>Pre-Race Arrangements</p>
<p>A total of 15 people participated in this race, with a total of 71 pigeons. The starting point was in Changzhou, so all the pigeons participating in the race were taken to Changzhou by Chen Qihui of the Pigeon Association and Cao Yongnian of the Zoo on the 11:00 PM Beijing-Shanghai night express train the night before last. In addition to the staff of the Pigeon Association and the Zoo, the judges also included Zhou Shuwang and four others invited from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Xu Jianhua and six others from the Mass Education Center, totaling 15 people. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, they were sent to the judging locations separately by a hired car of the association.</p>
<p>Race Conditions</p>
<p>The 71 pigeons were released in Changzhou at 8:30 AM yesterday morning and successively flapped their wings and flew back to Shanghai to return to their nests. The earliest arrival was the British-breed speckled pigeon of Mr. Li Xinming at No. 12 Tiantang Street, Puyuxi Road. It arrived in Shanghai at 10:33 AM, covering the entire distance of more than 160 kilometers in just 2 hours and 3 minutes. The others arrived in Shanghai successively within five hours. A total of 45 pigeons qualified, while the remaining 26 pigeons took more than two hours to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>First Arrival</p>
<p>The names of the pigeon owners and the arrival times of the pigeons that returned to Shanghai before 11:00 AM, with a golden course flight time of less than three hours, are recorded below: Tao Dunji (Changping Road, West Shanghai) 10:50 AM, Wang Guicai (Haichang Road, Zhabei) 10:50:21, Tao Shunji (same as above) 10:52 AM, Shen Zongde (North Sichuan Road) 10:55:17, Shen Zongde (same as above) 10:55:19, Ling Yunsheng (Yuejiazuilu) 10:55:40, Zhu Jingli (Lafayette Road) 10:56 AM, Chen Zhaoyuan (Tangjiawan) 10:56 AM, Chen Zhaoyuan (same as above) 10:57:30, Wang Jingyuan (Feilu) 10:58:13.</p>
<p>Judging Results</p>
<p>However, the official rankings will be determined after calculating the ratio based on the different distances of the pigeon nests, which will take about a week. According to a reporter from Datong News, the first place should belong to Mr. Li Xinming's pigeon, because its performance was the most outstanding. At the same time, after the judges of the zoo have determined the results, the top pigeons will be displayed in the zoo for several days.</p>
<h3 id="e95">High Court Branch to Open Trial Regularly: Wang Xinggao's Appeal Case <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Family of Tang Jiapeng to be Summoned to Court for Questioning</p>
<p>Wang Xinggao, a key suspect from Funing in the death of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was reported by the perpetrator Zhao Guangfu, because after killing Tang, he did not receive the promised reward and was imprisoned. He could not bear the injustice and reported the matter to the French Police Department last winter. On the night of December 13, the French Concession Police and the Public Concession Old Gate Police assisted in arresting Wang at the Central Hotel on Wuma Road and brought him to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. Over three months, the court opened hearings and summoned witnesses for questioning. Although Wang denied it outright, the presiding judge comprehensively reviewed various evidence and witness statements and carefully studied them. As a result, he determined that Wang Xinggao did have the act of inciting murder. On April 1 of this year, Wang Xinggao was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder and deprived of his civil rights for life. Wang refused to accept the first-instance judgment and filed an appeal with the High Court Branch based on his reasons. The High Court Collegiate Bench has heard the case several times. The informant Zhao Guangfu also confessed that Gu Zhuxuan, the old Guan of the Tianchan Stage, also known as the Fourth Boss, entrusted Wang to invite someone to assassinate Tang. Because the court needed to investigate the case in detail, it ordered a postponement. The informant, prisoner Zhao Guangfu, also wrote several letters to Gu Zhuxuan to demand remuneration, but Gu ignored them. He then reported Gu Zhuxuan to the French Police Department for inciting murder. On September 10, Gu was arrested by the French Police and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. During Gu's case, the judge in charge of Wang Xinggao's appeal case at the High Court Branch applied for an extension of the investigation period because Wang's case required a long time for investigation. The Criminal Court decided to extend the detention period for Wang Xinggao by two months. Subsequently, the Second Special Court ruled on Gu Zhuxuan's case on the 28th of last month, sentencing him to 15 years in prison and depriving him of his civil rights for 10 years. Gu also refused to accept the judgment and submitted a statement of appeal. The Second Special Court sent all the case files to the High Court Branch for review on the morning of the 8th. This has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the High Court Branch has scheduled the Wang Xinggao appeal case to be heard on the afternoon of the 13th (Wednesday) at 3:00 PM. The notification letters for his defense lawyers and witness summonses were issued and sent by the police the day before yesterday. It is also heard that the family of the victim Tang Jiapeng has been summoned to court for questioning this time.</p>

<p>Xu Chengmao is Covered in Scars, with Swollen and Rotten Armpits</p>
<p>At 11:30 PM the night before last, five robbers wearing blue and black cloth short shirts and trousers with Jiangbei accents suddenly came to the home of Xu Chengmao (44 years old, from Funing), who raises pigs and rents out rickshaws in the thatched shed west of the Zhijiang Temple Road (i.e., the north end of Datong Road) in Zhabei. They showed handguns and forbade anyone from making a sound. Because the owner refused to reveal where the valuables were hidden, the robbers first used iron rods to beat him, causing Xu Chengmao to suffer serious injuries to his head, forehead, waist, back, and leg bones. Then, they tied Xu's hands behind his back, lifted him up with iron rods, and used kerosene to burn under his armpits. Currently, Xu's armpits are swollen and rotten, and his body is covered in scars. As a result, the robbers robbed him of 16 silver dollars, 30 silver dimes, 40,000 copper coins, and several pieces of clothing. The owner has now reported the case to the Sun Temple Police Station, which has reported the case to the Xinzha Sub-bureau to track down the criminals and recover the stolen goods.</p>

<p>Inspect the Vagrant Habitual Labor Center for Reference</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs was previously ordered by the Municipal Government that, according to the security measures stipulated in the Criminal Law, regarding the compulsory labor and moral education of the security institutions, the number of people is large and the effectiveness is difficult to see. After repeatedly convening the relevant bureaus for consultation, it was proposed that the municipal government allocate funds to prepare for the establishment of a special institution for teaching and supporting vagrants. After the report was submitted for approval, the Secretariat of the Municipal Government sent a letter stating that the special institution for teaching and supporting vagrants should be estimated in detail by the relevant bureaus to be submitted for approval. The Bureau of Social Affairs convened the bureaus of Public Security, Finance, Public Works, Education, and Health for consultation. In view of the fact that the Shanghai Vagrant Habitual Labor Center has been operating for many years with remarkable achievements, it has been used as a reference for regulations. After jointly sending personnel to Caohoujing for inspection, the organizational situation of the institution was reported by the Bureau of Social Affairs to the Secretariat of the Municipal Government, which was submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, and then preparations will be made.</p>

<p>The War Zone Temporary Relief Loan Office is one of the undertakings of the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee. Since its establishment, it has been three years. At the beginning of the office, the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee decided that the operation period would be four years.

The number of loans issued by the office reached nearly 300,000 yuan. Now that the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee has ended, the business of the War Zone Loan Office is specially merged into the Poor People's Loan Office of this city. All procedures and repayment methods are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Loan Office. A public notice has been published in the newspaper.

The company, located on Yangxing Street, specialized in buying and selling goods and handling ship chartering and ticketing. The plaintiff's father invested 1,400 taels of silver, as evidenced by the partnership agreement, which specified that Zhang Shuming was the manager, Zhang Fenke was the assistant manager, and Zhang Jinhao was the bookkeeper. All company operations were to be managed by the manager and assistant manager, while Zhang Jinhao was responsible for managing the finances. The company's business was to be summarized every three years. In the 21st year of the Republic [1932], the plaintiff received the Macrofa Company's ledger, which showed a surplus of over 370,000 taels of silver in the company's reserve fund. Unexpectedly, at the end of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the company suddenly closed down, and all company accounts and funds were taken to Chaozhou by Zhang Shuming and Zhang Fenke without the plaintiff's prior knowledge. Upon learning of this, the plaintiff questioned the defendants about the reason for the closure, but they refused to disclose it. According to the plaintiff, the company's business in the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic did not decline, and the surplus should have increased. Furthermore, no liquidation announcement was ever made, indicating that the company had not suffered any losses. As the defendants were either the manager, assistant manager, or bookkeeper, they abruptly closed the company and took the company's books and funds with them during a period of thriving business. They not only failed to obtain the plaintiff's consent but also kept it a secret. The defendants collectively violated Article 357, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law regarding occupational embezzlement and Article 366 regarding breach of trust. The plaintiff requested that the court investigate the matter according to the law and, as an ancillary civil suit, requested that the defendants be held jointly liable for the return of the accounts for verification. The court, based on the indictment, repeatedly summoned the defendants for questioning, but they consistently failed to appear. At the continued hearing on the 23rd of last month, the first defendant, Zhang Shuming, remained absent. Only the second defendant, Zhang Fenke, appeared with his lawyer, Dong Chi, and stated that the company had been making money in the past, but on December 6th of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the company was temporarily closed due to the instructions of the general manager and half of the shareholders, as well as the poor market conditions. Although the company had over 400,000 in reserve funds, there were 600,000 in bad debts in Shantou, Dalian, Qingdao, and other locations, resulting in a significant amount of outstanding debt. General Manager Zhang Shuming is currently involved in a lawsuit that has not yet concluded, making it difficult to settle the accounts. Ten of the nineteen shareholders are in Shantou, while only the plaintiff, Gu Fan, is in Shanghai. He wants to see the books and was told to go to Shantou to see them. The judge instructed Zhang Fenke that the case could not be concluded without Zhang Shuming's presence and that he should immediately write to Zhang Shuming urging him to come to Shanghai to surrender and be questioned. In the meantime, he was required to post a bail of 2,000 yuan before being released. Lawyer Dong Chi posted the bail, and then repeatedly telegraphed Shantou, instructing Zhang Shuming to personally bring the books to Shanghai for questioning, but Zhang Shuming never responded. The case is now scheduled for continuation on the afternoon of the 15th of this month. If Zhang Shuming is still absent, it is unclear how the case can be resolved.</p>

They also requested that the association find an alternative site next to the Caojiadu Small Ball Field to hold the Shanghai West National Products Exhibition, scheduled for drawing of lots on November 15th and the official opening on the 18th, with no extension. Therefore, an urgent notice was issued stating that manufacturers who have already registered to participate should bring the booth fee to the meeting on November 15th for the drawing of lots. Those who have not registered but wish to participate should register immediately to avoid missing out due to reaching capacity. Therefore, this notice is issued.</p>

<p>This year, the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins have suffered from floods, leaving the victims without clothes or food, and diseases are rampant.

Fortunately, it has received support from all sides, resulting in significant effects. The previous performance by Mr. Mei Lanfang at the Golden Theatre was one example. In order to meet the needs of the Shanghai public and speak out for the victims, the council sent people to the north to invite Ms. Meng Xiaodong and Ms. Zhang Eyun to perform in Shanghai. Ms. Meng and Ms. Zhang agreed immediately because the matter concerned disaster relief. However, Ms. Meng and Ms. Zhang were also busy performing in Ping Opera for fundraising, and therefore did not arrive here until yesterday. It is now known that they are scheduled to take the stage again at the Golden Theatre tomorrow night (the 12th) to perform a charity show for ten days, purely to speak out for the victims. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively participate and contribute to the cause. Millions of disaster victims will be grateful.

<p>Short-Term Primary School Education Research Association of This City</p>
<p>First General Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Administrative Issues All Studied and Completed</p>
<p>Remaining Issues Assigned to Schools by the Bureau of Education</p>
<p>In addition to establishing primary education research associations in various districts this semester, the Municipal Bureau of Education has also established a short-term primary school education research association. The first district research meeting concluded on the 9th. The first general meeting of the primary short-term primary school education research association was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the auditorium of Shangwen Primary School. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Schools</p>
<p>Principals or directors of various short-term primary schools and short-term primary school classes in various schools. Yesterday, there were more than 80 attendees, including Shangwen, Zhouqiao, Zhenru, Xinlu, Shicun, Bide, Pengpu, Shuji, Meixi, Caotang, Feihong, Hean, Wusong, Jingye, Wanzhu, Zhenxiu, Danhua, Longde, Weida, Songxue, Shihua, Fahua, Cangji, Xijiang, Tangwan, and other schools.

Bureau of Education representatives Zeng Shengdian, Qian Fugong, and Jia Renya attended for guidance. Zhang Zeng'an presided over the meeting and Huang Fengming recorded the minutes.</p>
<p>Bureau of Education's Speech</p>
<p>After the usual formalities, the chairman gave a report, followed by a training speech by the section chief of the Bureau of Education, representing Director Pan. He mentioned that Director Pan could not attend in person due to a trip to Beijing, so he was representing him. The Bureau of Education, considering that short-term primary schools are different from ordinary primary schools in terms of administration, teaching, and guidance, has specially established a short-term primary school education research association this semester in addition to the primary education research association to take on the special responsibility. However, short-term primary schools are newly established by the country and have no established methods to follow and few precedents to draw upon. Therefore, there must be many difficult problems. Moreover, the significance of short-term primary schools lies in supplementing the shortcomings of primary schools and is the education needed under China's economic situation. The significance of the research and the mission of everyone are greater than those of other research associations. He hoped that everyone would conduct research based on practical experience and avoid empty talk. At the same time, they should seek improvement based on the research results.</p>
<p>Research Results</p>
<p>There were more than 30 research questions this time, divided into three categories: administration, teaching, and guidance. In addition to the teaching and guidance questions, which will be assigned to designated schools for research by the Bureau of Education, the remaining administrative questions were researched in the general meeting yesterday. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Bureau of Education designated schools to research the reasons for the decrease in the number of students and remedial measures. The schools will submit separate reports to the Bureau of Education, and this meeting will not discuss it.</p>
<p>(2) Can children who are under or over the prescribed age be admitted if there are no ordinary primary schools nearby? As a result, those who are under the age are not admitted because their level may not be sufficient, and those who are over the age can be requested from the Bureau of Education for approval and appropriate flexibility.</p>
<p>(3) Can the teachers of the affiliated short-term primary school classes be given additional salaries? As a result, considering the financial difficulties of the city treasury, this issue will be discussed later.</p>
<p>(4) How should classes be opened if the number of students is more than 50 and less than 100? As a result, if this situation occurs, the school should directly report it to the Bureau of Education.</p>
<p>(5) How should graduates' requests to continue their studies be handled? As a result, the original school should find a way to transfer them to nearby primary schools for free admission.</p>
<p>(6) What grade level in primary school is the short-term primary school graduate equivalent to? What grade level in primary school is most appropriate for them to enter after graduation? As a result, each school should determine it based on their level.</p>
<p>(7) How should single-grade primary school teachers handle leave requests? As a result, the leave application procedures for ordinary single-grade primary school teachers should be followed.</p>

<p>Liangjiang Alumni Association</p>
<p>Preparing to Celebrate the Anniversary of the Alma Mater</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School in Jiangwan, Shanghai, will celebrate its 15th anniversary. The alumni of the school organized the Shanghai Alumni Association in 1933. Now, because the alma mater has experienced setbacks in the past and created today's glorious position, the number of graduates from previous sessions and the excellent performance are known and praised by the society. In addition, in recent years, the atmosphere of women's physical education in China has been booming, and the lack of guidance from the alma mater is also a major reason. On the occasion of this anniversary, although the country is in great difficulty, it is not convenient to celebrate, but looking back on the past and feeling deeply, it has been decided to prepare for a meaningful celebration. Now, it is actively planning to announce to alumni at home and abroad, re-edit the alumni directory, and send letters to alumni in various places to discuss how to support the revival and construction of the alma mater, and lay the permanent foundation of the alumni association. It is said that the association is currently being carried out by Huang Da, Jiang Lixian, and Yang Yaxin.</p>

<p>Carson Wins Hard Court Singles Championship</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Loses Bitterly After Five Sets</p>
<p>Leading 2-1, Injured His Foot in the Fourth Set and Lost</p>
<p>Mrs. De Foe Wins Mixed Doubles Championship</p>
<p>The French Chamber of Commerce's hard court tennis tournament concluded yesterday. Qiu Feihai and Miss Howell's mixed doubles were ultimately no match for De Foe and Mrs. Mall, losing 0-2. The singles final between Wang Wenzheng and Carson was tense and intense. Wang Wenzheng fought hard for five sets, leading 2-1, but unfortunately injured his foot and lost two sets in a row, suffering a bitter defeat. The hard court championship came to an end.</p>
<p>(Men's Singles Final) Carson 4-6, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 Wang Wenzheng</p>
<p>Wenzheng's Bitter Defeat Due to Foot Injury is a Pity</p>
<p>The men's singles match, which attracted the most attention, began at 2:30 PM. Wang Wenzheng was ambitious and intended to win the championship and avenge his previous loss on the grass court. After the serve, he was very aggressive, winning two games in a row, which made Carson shudder. In the third game, he began to fight back hard. Both sides stood on the baseline, each with long shots from both corners, carefully and cautiously, not daring to easily get on the net. Wenzheng often made Carson admire with excellent landing points. Wenzheng led 6-4 in the first set. In the second set, Wang won a game first, but Carson won three games in one go, which was extremely wonderful, attracting thunderous applause from the audience. Although he won several games later, he lost too many and could not recover, eventually losing to Carson 4-6. Wenzheng then tried his best to make Carson exhausted with diagonal shots, which worked. Carson really couldn't get on the net and lost to Wenzheng 4-6. At this time, Wenzheng's victory was within reach. In the 2-1 situation, he only needed to win one more game to win the championship. After the break, Carson tried his best and worked hard. As soon as he had the opportunity, he went to the net, and his powerful serve made Wenzheng helpless. Wang still calmly fought back. At 4-3, Wenzheng suddenly injured his foot while saving the ball and couldn't run. After a short rest, he tried his best again, but finally lost 4-6. The fifth set was the most important moment. After fighting to a 1-1 tie, Wenzheng asked to give up due to his inability to run, but the referee refused, and he had to fight. He only served and didn't return the serve. Carson won easily 6-1. As a result, Carson won the championship 3-1. Therefore, Wenzheng's defeat today was extremely unfortunate. If he could have won in the fourth set, then it wouldn't have come to this. In terms of skills, Carson was indeed better.</p>
<p>(Mixed Doubles Semifinals) Mrs. Mall De Foe 6-1, 6-3 Mrs. Tuiler Colonel Qiu</p>

<p>In the mixed doubles, De Foe and Mrs. Mall first defeated Colonel Qiu Tuiler 2-0 in the morning to win the finals. In the afternoon, they played against Qiu Feihai and Miss Howell in the finals. De Foe's smashing was extremely fierce, and Mrs. Mall also had excellent saves. In the first set, the enemy was wiped out, Qiu Feihai struggled hard, but Miss Howell was too weak. Although the first set was not a blank, only two games were recovered. De Mall won the doubles championship in a lighthearted manner.</p>

<p>Tung Wah Defeats Western Business Heavily</p>
<p>Result: 6-1</p>
<p>Tung Wah met Western Business in the Western Football Club's Group A match yesterday. The two sides clashed at Yi Yuan at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Although Western Business is a mediocre team, they played well yesterday and threatened Tung Wah from time to time. In the first half, Western Business opened the scoring first. Although they lost two goals in a row later, the score was still close. It was only because a penalty kick failed to score that the first half would have been a tie. In the second half, Western Business lost four goals in the last fifteen minutes of the game. Their defeat was due to insufficient endurance.</p>
<p>Western Business Opens the Scoring First</p>
<p>After Tung Wah kicked off in the center, the five forwards lined up and attacked the Western Business defense. Western Business was unwilling to be outdone, intercepted the ball and made a counterattack. Li Ning saved the ball, and Gu Shangxiang took advantage of the situation to shoot, trying to gain an unexpected harvest. Shi Wei was also not an ordinary person, and he didn't score. Sun Jinshun was a counter-footed faction, and Jia Youliang immediately passed it to Dai Linjing. He lost a little bit of delay, and was saved by Mike Lang into a corner kick. It was unfortunate to open the ball, and it was sent far away by Haitlai in one kick. Hagerlov got the ball and went deep, and Gu Shangxiang was eager to save the ball, resulting in a corner kick. Yaer got the ball and turned it, hitting the goal post and rebounding in front of the goal. The left wing caught up and kicked it in.</p>
<p>Mai Sun Turns Defeat into Victory</p>
<p>After Tung Wah lost this goal, the whole team of athletes was furious and desperately counterattacked. After a long time of maneuvering, Li Yichen passed it to Dai Linjing, who shot but was saved. Gu Shang happened to come, and he delivered a kick from afar. Jia Youliang rushed to the side of the goal, jumped up and headed the ball. Shi Wei was stunned and watched the ball enter the net. The tie was made, and the audience cheered. After that, Li Yichen advanced with the ball and went deep into the defense. Sun Jinshun was shrewd and capable, and lifted his iron leg to hit the ball into the goal. He immediately turned defeat into victory. Lin Jing scored three goals in a row, breaking the enemy's goal. Unfortunately, Jia's offside was invalid. Before long, Western Business had the opportunity to counterattack. Li Ning was anxious to protect the car and accidentally knocked down the foreign general. Le Xiurong was in charge of the washing like a mountain. Hof took the penalty kick, but the ball was not in luck and hit the goal post and bounced out. On the stage, the foreign face was happy for nothing, and sighed with his head down.</p>
<p>The Foreign General Resists with All His Strength</p>
<p>After the lemon, the battle started again. Western Business was determined to break the boat and calmly fought back, defending the country with all their lives. He did not easily take the offensive until he met the enemy. This made Tung Wah's athletes unable to achieve anything under this serious surveillance. Sun Jinshun rushed out diagonally and was blocked by Man Lai Tuo. Cao's missed a chance, and Dai Linjing's head was saved. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun failed to score several times. Although Sun's foot was strong, Shi Weihang was also a likable person, responding sensitively. Cao got the ball and dribbled in, handing it to Dai to pass it to Jia Youliang, who kicked it diagonally and attacked the net from the corner of the goal, which broke the dull situation.</p>
<p>Three Goals in One Go</p>
<p>At this point, there were only fifteen minutes left to the end, but Western Business had many veterans, who were afraid of being weak. On the contrary, Tung Wah became more and more courageous. Sun Jinshun passed it to Li, who was unable to attack because of the surveillance of the foreign general. Therefore, he temporarily passed it to Cao, who followed the law and made it diagonally. A kick flew into the enemy's net. This ball was clear and beautiful, just like Jia's. Before long, A Dai got the ball and passed it to Sun Jinshun, and it was successful again. Li Yichen was envious when he saw someone making contributions. He received Jia's method and did not disgrace his mission. He also attacked and shot into the net, completing the result of 6-1.</p>

<p>The Shenbao Medical Weekly introduces the Japanese Trachoma Prevention Association By Chen Ren</p>
<p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advanced countries around the world began to systematically and planfully engage in trachoma eradication efforts. Hungary took the lead in 1886, followed by Prussia in Germany in 1889. Subsequently, other major powers followed suit, regarding trachoma as a venomous snake or beast, plotting its eradication as if facing a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Among the countries with the widest distribution of trachoma, none is more prominent than Egypt. Among the poor, the incidence rate reached 100%, and even among the upper classes, it exceeded 95%. It can be said that everyone has trachoma. The Western name for trachoma is “Egyptian eye disease” for this reason. Since the beginning of the 20th century, a great eradication and prevention effort has begun, led by British ophthalmologist MacCallan. Over the past few decades, it has become a model for trachoma eradication and prevention efforts worldwide.</p>
<p>In the Far East, China and Japan are also known for the wide distribution of trachoma. Therefore, when trachoma is mentioned, China and Japan are immediately thought of, and there is no lack of contempt. However, since the Japanese government promulgated trachoma prevention laws in 1919, the entire country has devoted its efforts to eradicating this disease. Over the past decade, remarkable results have been achieved, and the incidence of trachoma in annual conscription examinations has been decreasing day by day. When countries around the world discuss trachoma, they all express respect for Japan. In contrast, our country lags behind in every aspect. The poison of trachoma invades the entire country, depriving many strong and poor people of their livelihoods and weakening the country's strength. Today, China's trachoma eradication work is urgent. Neighboring Japan has already implemented it, so it is necessary for us to learn from other countries. To understand Japan's trachoma eradication efforts, one must first understand the Japanese Trachoma Prevention Association, which lives and dies with trachoma in Japan. We will introduce it first.</p>
<p>The eradication of trachoma is one of the sanitation efforts. Sanitation is two-sided, one side is individual and the other is social. Social sanitation efforts require political power to systematically and planfully engage in eradication and prevention work. Therefore, social sanitation efforts can also be said to be sanitation policies. At this time, there must be so-called enlightened elements, especially our doctors and advanced elements of social knowledge, who fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of diseases and devote their efforts to advocating for society and engaging in publicity: on the one hand, instill knowledge in the people and promote sanitation; on the other hand, attract the attention of the authorities, propose prevention plans, and promote their implementation. Under this great will, the Japanese Trachoma Prevention Association was founded in Tokyo in 1915.</p>
<p>(I) The Real Purpose of the Association</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has been united in its efforts to promote the creation of a modern nation. The purpose of trachoma prevention propaganda is also based on the country as the highest premise. The three major reasons are the only slogan of their propaganda: First, the reduction of productivity. Because Japan must work to revive the country, it must increase national wealth. Now, because of illness, the ability is small, and parasitism due to blindness will hinder the development of the country. Second, the reduction of military strength. Japan is a small country, and to maintain its international prestige, it relies entirely on military force. If soldiers have eye diseases, their combat effectiveness will be reduced, and the national strength will be exhausted. Third, the concept of national shame. Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States often uses the fact that Japan has a lot of trachoma, a disease of barbaric countries, as a pretext. Being called a barbaric country is a great shame to Japan's self-esteem, and immigration is blocked, hindering Japan's overseas development. Therefore, Japan supports and strives to obey the eradication of trachoma. As a result, the formulation of trachoma prevention laws, the establishment of trachoma research bureaus and treatment hospitals, the holding of lectures, and the promotion of prevention efforts have all developed and become known to the world, which is very good.</p>
<p>(II) The Mission of the Association</p>
<p>The mission of the association is very clear: to gather the enlightened elements of society, doctors, especially ophthalmologists, to fight for a common ideal. The association's initial undertaking was solely to promote the attention of the government and to implement systematic policies. Due to the continuous efforts of the members, the Japanese government promulgated the Trachoma Prevention Law in 1919. Although the promulgation of this law was due to the efforts of the association, the mission of the association did not stop there. In the association's publications, it is said: "Because members have contributed to the prevention effort, they have gained the attention of people from all walks of life. The association is very happy about this. However, the goals we expect in the future are still quite far away. The past undertakings are only a small part. After the promulgation of the Trachoma Prevention Law, we should not celebrate too much. Only by fully utilizing this law and working together to eradicate this poison can we achieve good results."</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the prevention law, the association's undertakings clearly shifted to another aspect, namely, the practical implementation of prevention work: "The assistance of the government authorities, the full implementation of the prevention law. The investigation, examination, and treatment of trachoma in all aspects, the lack of planning and implementation of prevention efforts, or the connection of local trachoma prevention organizations, and the establishment of branches, etc."</p>
<p>(III) Important Undertakings in the Association's History</p>
<p>The association held its founding meeting in the Department of Forensic Medicine at Tokyo Medical University in 1915. The inaugural meeting was held in April of the following year. All of those who joined the association were famous people at the time. Under the leadership of Dr. Kawamoto, the father of Japanese ophthalmology, a great undertaking began. The important achievements of the past years are briefly described below: Things to Know About Quitting Smoking (V) By Zhang Zhongming</p>
<p>(V) Sleep-assisted Smoking Cessation Method</p>
<p>This method uses a large amount of sleeping pills to keep the quitter in a state of drowsiness, so that he does not experience the pain of nicotine addiction and can achieve the goal of quitting. This method must be carried out in a hospital under the close supervision of a doctor. Generally speaking, young and strong people may be able to support it, but weak people may have the danger of falling asleep and never waking up. Therefore, doctors often dare not try it.</p>
<p>(VI) Injection Smoking Cessation Method</p>
<p>The injection smoking cessation method uses a calcium mixture injected into the veins once a day. On the one hand, smoking cessation drugs must still be taken to gradually achieve the goal of quitting. This method was first created in Japan. Recently, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory in our country can also manufacture it by itself. The efficacy of the injection method is similar to that of the injections used in the tapering method.</p>
<p>(VII) Cold Turkey Method</p>
<p>The cold turkey method is more popular in Europe and the United States. Because in European and American countries, the use of narcotics such as opium and morphine (foreigners mostly swallow and inject, and do not smoke) is a crime and has long been strictly prohibited. Therefore, once discovered, they are sent to the hospital to quit. This method requires the quitter to be admitted to the hospital without any substitute narcotics, and only a few auxiliary drugs are given.</p>
<p>According to this method, the time required is very short, about a week, to achieve the goal of quitting. However, the quitter suffers terribly, and the weak are prone to accidents. It is a dangerous method.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 Abstinence Symptoms</p>
<p>Abstinence symptoms, commonly known as "nicotine addiction," are the various uncomfortable phenomena that occur when the amount of smoking is reduced or completely stopped. These phenomena vary depending on the individual's environment, strength, amount of smoking, mental state, and age. The most important symptoms include muscle and bone pain, insomnia, diarrhea, nocturnal emission, cough, nausea and vomiting, palpitations, sudden chills and fever, sneezing, and tearing. Several symptoms may occur simultaneously, or only one or two symptoms may occur. There are many different symptoms, and it is difficult to describe them all. The severity of the various symptoms also varies. Some are more severe in this aspect and less severe in that aspect, and some are suddenly light and suddenly heavy. In short, the strength of abstinence symptoms is directly proportional to the rate of smoking reduction. That is, the less smoking, the stronger the abstinence symptoms. But once the nicotine addiction is completely broken, all the uncomfortable phenomena during quitting will gradually disappear, and life will return to the normal state before smoking. Therefore, abstinence symptoms are not permanent. They are only occasional symptoms during quitting. This is what quitters should be comforted by.</p>
<p>The biggest goal of doctors is to prevent and stop the occurrence of various abstinence symptoms. Therefore, the first thing to do is to choose auxiliary drugs that are suitable for each person's situation to prevent them. Second, if discomfort occurs in the middle, it is necessary to respond temporarily to reduce the pain. The strength of abstinence symptoms is the key to the success or failure of quitting smoking, and the doctor's skill can also be judged by how they deal with abstinence symptoms.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Self-cultivation During Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>During the smoking cessation period, there are abstinence symptoms of varying degrees of severity. We already know this. Therefore, in addition to drug treatment, quitters must also pay special attention to their physical and mental health to facilitate the progress of smoking cessation.</p>
<p>(I) Mental Attention</p>
<p>Quitters should be indifferent and quiet. All feelings of sorrow, evil, fear, and fright must be kept away from. At ordinary times, you can use beautiful music to cultivate your temperament, or take a walk in the fragrant suburbs to divert your surroundings. When your body and mind are at peace, quitting smoking will be twice as effective with half the effort.</p>
<p>(II) Attention to Exercise and Work</p>
<p>During the smoking cessation period, exercise and work are not absolutely forbidden. However, overwork and strenuous exercise should still be stopped.</p>
<p>(III) Attention to Diet</p>
<p>All food and drink should be no different from ordinary people. However, irritating foods such as alcohol, chili, ginger, and pepper should be avoided. Glutinous food and fruit are very likely to cause indigestion or diarrhea, so they should also be limited.</p>
<p>(IV) Attention to the Room</p>
<p>The room should be well-lit and well-ventilated. Most smokers work at night and have little contact with sunlight. They also swallow clouds and spit out fog, and the air they breathe is inevitably turbid. Therefore, when quitting smoking, they should try to correct these bad habits.</p>
<p>(V) Attention to Hygiene</p>
<p>Hygiene should be followed by everyone, but during the smoking cessation period, you should pay more attention to it. Because once there is negligence, it is easy to develop diseases, which will hinder the progress of smoking cessation.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>It feels like a lot has been written. Now, let's make a summary of the main points.</p>
<p>(I) You must have a strong determination.</p>
<p>(II) You must be guided by a doctor.</p>
<p>(III) Extremely effective and non-toxic smoking cessation drugs are still waiting to be invented.</p>
<p>(IV) Abstinence symptoms are an inevitable fact during the quitting period. You must have patience.</p>
<p>(V) To increase the efficiency of quitting smoking, strict laws and regulations are the only way.</p>
<p>Oh, gentlemen who smoke opium. Everyone knows the harm of opium. And those of you who have experienced it firsthand can describe it in detail. For the sake of the nation's future and the country's survival, you have to give up your habits. Therefore, for your sake, instead of regretting it in the future, why not make up your mind today? Although quitting smoking is not easy, if you have a strong will, you will not fail. Once the nicotine addiction is eliminated and you become a new person again, how happy will you be? What day is today? What time is it now? Is there still room for leisure and elegance to linger in the misty clouds? (The End)</p>

<p>The Latest Anti-Tuberculosis Front Lines in Various Countries (Part 1) By Ding Huikang</p>
<p>The Three Lung Disease Insurance in Italy and Switzerland</p>
<p>Italy implemented an anti-tuberculosis insurance charter in 1929. Article 10, Section 27 states that all salaried people between the ages of 15 and 65, and their families, a total of 26 million people, almost half of the entire Italian population, should fulfill their obligations under the insurance implementation regulations. Their rights include hospital treatment, doctor's treatment, and the issuance of sickness allowances.</p>
<p>Switzerland also implemented a lung disease insurance method in 1928. Its regulations and rights are the same as those of other disease insurance methods. Approximately, within every five years after insurance, if you suffer from lung disease, you can be hospitalized for 540 days.</p>
<p>Improvements in Clinic's Anti-Tuberculosis Visits</p>
<p>Recently, countries have been working hard on research on anti-tuberculosis. Clinics should not only pay attention to tuberculosis patients, but also examine people who are suspected of having tuberculosis symptoms but have not yet developed subjective and pathological symptoms. These undiscovered patients can be obtained during the examination, that is, general experimental doctors can also send them. In addition, home treatment should also be actively carried out in cooperation to eliminate the source of infection. It is most important to conduct regular examinations on new tuberculosis patients and those who live nearby, such as relatives, friends, co-residents, and co-workers, and should not be neglected.</p>
<p>Lung examinations can be carried out in groups within certain age groups and periods, such as during adolescence, or certain occupations, such as glass workers.</p>
<p>In addition, the most important contribution to anti-tuberculosis is the tuberculin skin test for students. Although lung disease is not a major problem during school, Ah's X-ray examination of 6,788 children found that 45 people had active, fresh childhood tuberculosis, with a percentage of 0.64%. Therefore, compulsory examinations should also be carried out in university students.</p>
<p>In short, if early diagnosis of lung disease can be popularized, the treatment results will be better, the treatment period can be shortened, and the country's productivity can be increased considerably. Q&amp;A on Dental Knowledge (IX) By Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 46) What is the difference between dead teeth and live teeth?</p>
<p>(Answer) The function of dead teeth is inferior. Because there is no sensation, even if they are damaged, such as by cavities, there is no feeling. Moreover, the tooth substance is dead, the elasticity is reduced, and it cannot support the enamel like living tooth substance to make it firm.</p>
<p>(Question 47) The dentist said "removing the nerve," is that removing the pulp?</p>
<p>(Answer) Removing the nerve is removing the pulp. Because the pulp contains nerves, it is commonly called the nerve.</p>
<p>(Question 48) Since the pulp is so important, it should be protected. Why is it sometimes removed?</p>
<p>(Answer) The pulp should be removed under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(1) When there is inflammation, swelling, and unbearable pain, and this inflammation cannot be subsided. (2) When it is already necrotic (it should be removed immediately at this time). (3) For the purpose of fitting dentures, when it is necessary to drill through the pulp chamber, the pulp should be removed first.</p>
<p>(Question 49) What is the relationship between pulp, dentin, enamel, and age?</p>
<p>(Answer) The dentin and enamel of children's deciduous teeth are very thin, the pulp chamber is large, and the pulp is also large. The permanent teeth of young people have thicker dentin and enamel, and the pulp chamber and pulp are also smaller. The older the age, the smaller the pulp chamber and pulp. Some elderly people's teeth even have no pulp and are almost solid.</p>
<p>(Question 50) In addition to the three main parts of enamel, dentin, and pulp, are there other parts of the tooth?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are also cementum (i.e., bone substance) and the periodontal ligament. Q&amp;A on Common Diseases By Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(72) Liver Syphilis</p>
<p>(Question) What is liver syphilis?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is a syphilitic lesion that occurs in the substance of the liver, causing the destruction of liver cells and overall atrophy.</p>
<p>(Question) Does liver syphilis occur after birth or is it inherited before birth?</p>
<p>(Answer) Both acquired and congenital can occur.</p>
<p>(Question) What changes occur in the nature of the liver in congenital liver syphilis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Congenital liver syphilis has diffuse or localized small cell infiltration and connective tissue proliferation. The liver is enlarged and hardened. Sometimes, new connective tissue atrophy occurs, liver cells are destroyed, the liver shrinks, and the surface becomes uneven.</p>
<p>(Question) What changes occur in the nature of the liver in acquired liver syphilis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Acquired liver syphilis usually occurs in the third stage of syphilis, showing symptoms of syphilitic liver interstitial inflammation or liver syphilitic tumors. The liver hardens, and millet-sized or walnut-sized gummas appear, making the liver surface uneven.</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms occur in the body of a patient with liver syphilis?</p>
<p>(Answer) If the lesion is limited to one part of the liver, and is sometimes in a not very important position, there may be no symptoms clinically. If the gumma compresses the portal vein, ascites, splenomegaly, varicose veins in the upper abdomen, and gastrointestinal bleeding will occur. If it compresses the bile duct, jaundice will occur.</p>
<p>(Question) What phenomena occur in the liver when syphilitic gummas first appear?</p>
<p>(Answer) At this time, there are soft, spherical protrusions on the surface or edge of the liver. When the gummas are absorbed, depressions are formed, and the substance is hardened, dividing the liver into multiple lobes. The liver surface is uneven.</p>
<p>(Question) How does the patient feel at this time?</p>
<p>(Answer) The patient feels tenderness in the affected area.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there a fever?</p>
<p>(Answer) There may be remittent or consumptive fever.</p>
<p>(Question) What disease is it easy to confuse with under these circumstances?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is easy to confuse with liver abscess.</p>
<p>(Question) How to diagnose liver syphilis?</p>
<p>(Answer) Just pay attention to the changes in the liver, and pain, ascites, splenomegaly, and other syphilitic changes, or check the blood for Wassermann reactions, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) How is it distinguished from ordinary cirrhosis?</p>
<p>(Answer) It can be distinguished by the patient's past history, large granules, slow progress, and better prognosis.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the prognosis of liver syphilis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The prognosis is poor. However, if anti-syphilitic therapy is performed early, there is still room for salvation and it cannot be considered absolutely bad.</p>
<p>(Question) How to treat this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is no other way than anti-syphilitic therapy. Pain Relief Medicine (40) By Li Xing</p>
<p>In 1846, Dr. Morton performed a demonstration at the famous Massachusetts General Hospital, using ether anesthesia on surgical patients with great success. Milton also received a special award from the Department of Industry and Commerce in the same year. Because he exclusively enjoyed the reputation of being the inventor, it also caused a lot of controversy. As a result, he suffered mental pain himself, and later died of a stroke. Jackson also went crazy later. This is a tragedy of sacrificing oneself for the happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>From this time on, the practical application of ether anesthesia has developed rapidly and become popular all over the world. In 1847, a man named Flourens used chloroform to anesthetize animals. In the same year, Simpson in Edinburgh, England, used chloroform on the human body, and chloroform also became an anesthetic. The following year, Flourens proposed using ethyl chloride as an anesthetic. This is the process of early anesthetic invention. In 1923, ethylene was discovered, and this gas is the best among anesthetics. Since there are anesthetics, incurable diseases can be surgically treated without pain. It is common to bring the dead back to life in surgery. We should now be grateful for the hard work and research of our medical predecessors, and we should also be grateful for the basic work done by chemists for medical scientists.</p>
<p>Flexible Use of Anesthetics</p>
<p>There are currently two types of anesthetics used, one is gas and the other is liquid. Liquid anesthetics are rapidly volatile compounds. Liquids must first be vaporized into a gas before they can be inhaled into the lungs. Once the anesthetic is inhaled into the lungs, it is absorbed by the circulating blood in the lungs, then flows to the whole body, and is carried to the brain to interact with nerve cells. After the action, the brain is numbed, initially like sleep, and gradually deepens into a daze, completely losing consciousness and sensation. At this time, surgery can be performed and the patient is completely unconscious. Anesthetics can be administered for several hours without any particular harm to the body. After stopping the anesthetic, the anesthetic in the body and nerve cells gradually returns to the blood, then enters the lungs through the blood, gradually volatilizes and leaves the body, and the patient's mind gradually returns to its original state.</p>
<p>In the early days of anesthetic use, patients undergoing surgery were mostly trembling with fear, and some were frightened to death before using anesthetics. In recent decades, with the widespread use of anesthetics, patients have gradually become less fearful of anesthetics, and are no longer as afraid of surgery as before. Before administering an anesthetic, injecting the patient with a small amount of anesthetic to numb their nerves can eliminate the patient's fear. This is the proper use of anesthetics. Eliminating pain and fear, performing various surgical operations to do the work of medicine, and saving dying patients, the contribution of science and medicine to mankind cannot be considered small.</p>
<p>Ether was the first anesthetic discovered, and its effect is mild. What anesthetic is safe? Ether is the easiest to use and the safety limit is the widest. It is easy to control the amount. If there is danger, the addition of anesthetic can be stopped immediately, and it is not difficult for the patient to turn from danger to safety. This is where it is superior to injectable anesthetics. Overdoses of injectable anesthetics cannot be saved. Ether is also not very harmful to the body. Ether has been used for nearly a century and still occupies an important position in anesthetics.</p>
<p>Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) was discovered earlier than ether, but its widespread use came later than ether. This gas smells better than ether, and patients do not feel pain when anesthetized. Ether smells more difficult to endure. Nitrous oxide has a rapid anesthetic effect and goes away quickly, and there is no pain after it goes away. It can be used for both major and minor surgeries, but the time should not be too long. Using nitrous oxide to relieve pain during childbirth is also considered a savior for women. People with heart disease and high blood pressure should not use it because this gas increases blood pressure. A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (74) By Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 3 Mental Cultivation of Patients</p>
<p>So, where should the so-called mental cultivation start? First: Patients should thoroughly understand that pulmonary tuberculosis is a curable disease. Because there is no specific drug for pulmonary tuberculosis, it is currently considered an incurable disease. This is completely wrong. If it is said that many pulmonary tuberculosis patients die, this is also true for all acute infectious diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and neurasthenia. Even ordinary colds have incurable cases. But these diseases are definitely not incurable! If patients understand this reason, their hope and belief in recovery will not be shaken and will not be threatened by other theories. Furthermore, patients should trust knowledgeable and enthusiastic doctors wholeheartedly and obey their orders. Only when the minds of doctors and patients are aligned can they work together to conquer this chronic enemy and gradually move the disease towards recovery.</p>
<p>How can patients' hope and belief in recovery not be shaken? In addition to the above, patients must have patience and, secondly, they must have sufficient willpower. We know that, with a few exceptions, most cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are chronic and relapse from time to time: therefore, no one can answer how long it will take to recover, not even the attending physician: such a long and indefinite period of time will naturally cause mental anxiety for the sufferer and fill the future with sadness. To deal with this stubborn chronic enemy, only long-term patience and agonizing thoughts are detrimental to the disease. Whether or not the patient can be patient depends first on whether he has sufficient willpower; otherwise, he will always succumb to habits and temptations. Patients with a strong will can have a great desire to overcome chronic diseases and will never be controlled by the disease. If patients have this kind of spirit, then the so-called physical and mental rest is of course not difficult to achieve! News Record of the 11th Congress of the Chinese Medical Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association took advantage of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Guangzhou Boji Hospital, the 50th anniversary of the Premier's medical studies and revolutionary activities, and the groundbreaking ceremony of the Yat-sen Medical College to hold the 11th Congress, the 3rd Congress after the merger, in Guangzhou. Originally, only more than 260 people registered to attend. When registering on the 1st of this month, the number of registered members suddenly increased by more than 100 people. As of the morning of the 5th, the number of registered members reached 455, of which foreign members accounted for about one-quarter. The nationalities were mainly British, American, German, Japanese, and French. The rest were domestic members (according to the association, there are 2,093 members, and only one-quarter of them attended this time). The conference officially opened on the morning of the 4th.

<p>The Shenbao Local Supplement Talks About the "W" on the Back of a Locust By Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The most famous prophet in our country is Liu Bowen. It is said that none of his prophecies have been wrong after the event. We dare not say whether this is credible. We only think that his words are unscientific. The so-called fulfillment is nothing more than the far-fetched association of a group of busybodies. If we examine them, we will laugh for three days. However, not only does China have Liu Bowen, but foreign countries also have Liu Bowen. Moreover, the prophecies of foreign Liu Bowens are often more arbitrary than those of Chinese Liu Bowens. Recently, we have heard of one or two foreign prophets who, with a pretentious air, either say that so-and-so will be assassinated in so-and-so country on so-and-so day of so-and-so month, or that a fire or flood will occur in so-and-so place after a certain period of time, as if they can even predict when the thunder god will strike a centipede spirit to death. If you ask them what they are basing their claims on, they will either tell you that they saw a comet fall from the south of the sky to the ground that night, or that the secrets of heaven cannot be revealed.</p>
<p>Now, another foreigner predicts that a world war is about to break out because he discovered an English letter on the back of a locust. This person is an old veteran of the Spanish-American War named Edward Maurice, who currently lives as a recluse in Briston, Oklahoma. His reason for making the prediction is that locusts have recently been discovered in local rural areas, and all of them have naturally generated English "W" letters on their backs, which is the abbreviation of the word "War." He said that he had seen the same manifestation on the backs of locusts before the Spanish-American War and the European War. He also said that if there was only one "W" letter, it would not be so bad. Unfortunately, there is a small dot under the letter, which indicates that the war will affect the whole world.</p>
<p>This old war veteran's prediction is as clever as our country's character-splitting masters. Whether or not a letter will appear on the back of a locust is already a question. Even if this miracle is real, there are hundreds of English words that start with "W," how can we determine that this "W" is the abbreviation of the word "War"? However, it is not fair for us to say that this old prophet is talking nonsense. Because he had experience before the Spanish-American War and the European War.</p>
<p>However, his prediction that a world war is about to break out is quite good. Unfortunately, he is old and has experienced war. If we want to see whether a war will happen, we should not observe the world situation, but ask the locust for a divination, which is too foolish. I tell you, all countries are currently desperately preparing for war. What is this for if not for war? This evidence is much more reliable than the letters on the back of a locust. The Lone Singer By Laoxin</p>
<p>These past few evenings when I went out onto the street, I encountered him, a very old lone singer. His hair was already gray, he was as thin as a twig, and the expression on his face was often silent and melancholy, tight, and his muscles seemed to be twitching. He had no embellishments, and all civilized objects were alien to him. He always wore that tattered robe that was covered in patches, stained with mottled greasy marks. The clothes were very thin, and although it was not a cold autumn wind, it blew him shivering. He, perhaps because of his old age, standing in the autumn wind, had that haggard and pitiful face. He relied on coming to eat, probably because of a broken huqin in his arms. The huqin was a sanxian, but it had become a solo string in his hand. The other two strings were probably broken, and because he had no money to spend, there were two holes left on the head. However, when he pulled it, the bow was still very lively, and he was good at using</p>
<p>Page 18</p>
<p>his left hand's three fingers, very purely "walking the line", from the lowest note to the highest note.</p>
<p>When I encountered him, also because I was originally an unemployed person with nothing to do and idle on the road, so I always stood there watching him play that skillful solo string. I don't know if it was because of his pitiful life, the tunes he played were all so heavy and melancholy, very much like he was telling about his hard and bitter life. Originally, I felt the same way as him, but I was still a young man, and I still had a stubborn temper, and it wasn't like his tunes, which symbolized all darkness. He played for a while, his hunched back twitched a few times, followed by stopping the hand that was pulling the bow, violently choking and coughing, and after spitting out a black and hard lump of phlegm, he cupped his hands and asked the passers-by who were listening to him for copper coins. He didn't make a sound, he only used the expression on his face to replace his words. But the passers-by may have been deliberately going against him, either taking advantage of the noise and slipping away, or standing there without moving.</p>
<p>His eyes fell on me. I was ashamed, I didn't know how I should answer his unspoken words. Because I wasn't someone who could pity others, I didn't have this qualification, if my pocket had a few copper coins at that time, a bowl of taro would have been my best dinner. Similarly, I used a kind of cowering and fearful attitude, and averted his gaze. Then he sighed, and with a slightly angry look, quickly glanced at the passers-by, and then dragged away with a kind of pitiful pace. I knew that he must have been very sad at this time, and maybe he was even blaming and cursing this world, this humanity, and unavoidably I was one of those who was blamed or cursed! But, what could be done? Let's just let our own family know about our pain.</p>
<p>When I was sending off his back, maybe my heart was even more sad than his. Because, judging from his huqin, he was a person who had had a very good fate, and I believe that he had lived a life that, although not very affluent, could be said to be stable when he was young. But, cruel time can no longer keep a person's happiness, maybe he was such an eliminated person. Time has buried everything about him, only letting him try sadness alone. Just like his huqin, he can only be left to play the solo string in a broken way, he has no freedom and right to fix it.</p>
<p>When he stopped, I hurried up again, because I loved to listen to his silent songs. But this time the fate was worse than the last time, not only could he not use his skillful tunes to exchange for other people's sympathy, but he got more indifference. What I saw with my own eyes were some young people who were recognized as gentlemen, civilized and beautifully decorated, walking away after beautifully cursing a couple of sentences. In such an opportunity that could easily provoke my "barbarian" temper, I quickly covered my face and walked away, because I could no longer watch such a cruel tragedy.</p>
<p>I haven't met this solo singer for several days, because of the matter of finding food. But, I still remember him firmly in my heart, when I closed my eyes, I seemed to see such a haggard and silent old solo singer, he was again casting that look of reproach on me, and I was afraid, and I opened my eyes wide. But after a while, that desolate silent tune blew into my ears again, like a very sharp knife, stabbing straight into my heart, and so I had to cover my ears again. But I haven't forgotten him, when I ran out onto the street, I was still searching for him in the crowd. But these were all illusions, I could no longer find him.</p>
<p>A long time passed again, when I couldn't borrow money and couldn't not eat again, I went to sell old newspapers. A large bundle of old newspapers was exchanged for forty-two and twenty-three copper coins at the old goods stall. At this time, I suddenly found the huqin of that solo singer whom I had been remembering every day in a pile of old goods. My heart was twitching, and I understood why I couldn't find him</p>

<h3 id="e120">A Visit to the China-Philippines Tobacco Company <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Jinhua Ting</p>
<p>The Vanguard of Overseas Chinese from the Philippines Returning to the Country to Establish Industries - Capital of 500,000 Yuan, Considered a Trial Venture</p>
<p>For nearly a century, China's national strength has weakened day by day and its diplomacy has become increasingly difficult due to the mutual pressure of internal troubles and external threats. Since the September 18th Incident, our national crisis has reached an extremely serious stage. Initially, we hoped for help from others, but now we realize that others cannot be relied upon. We must do everything ourselves. Only by concentrating our own strength can we overcome and create everything.</p>
<p>Our government has embraced this principle, enduring humiliation and bearing burdens, single-mindedly moving forward on this path. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the people of the whole country, especially overseas Chinese, will concentrate the manpower and financial resources of the entire nation to assist the government in building all undertakings and establishing the country's due strength.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese, although you have considerable wealth and stable businesses, living under someone else's roof and being subjected to humiliation is not a long-term solution. I believe you are always thinking of your motherland and desperately hoping that its strength will extend overseas, so that you can be protected by your motherland. At the same time, your compatriots in the motherland are also thinking of you day and night, earnestly hoping that your capital will be invested in the motherland, so that the motherland can receive your help.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese, do not wait and see, do not doubt. The time has come for the motherland to need your help. Look at the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, who have already started the first step of pioneering investment in establishing industries. They have gathered 500,000 yuan of capital and established the "China-Philippines Tobacco Company" in Shanghai. Having been open for only two months, their products have already become famous at sea and are in greater demand than supply.</p>
<p>Because we highly value this pioneer, we specially visited the founders, Mr. Lin Zhaopin and Mr. Kuang Guanglin, and at the same time visited their tobacco factory. Mr. Lin personally led the tour, explaining in detail the manufacturing work of each department. Mr. Kuang recounted the preparation process and the situation of overseas Chinese in the Philippines as follows.</p>
<p>The Financial Strength of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines</p>
<p>There are approximately 150,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, most of whom are engaged in industry and commerce, such as sugar, tobacco, coconut oil, firecrackers, etc., which are almost entirely operated by our overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese have opened more than 3,000 grocery stores throughout the Philippines. As a result, the economic strength of overseas Chinese in the Philippines is also quite strong, accounting for about 80% of the total economic power. However, in recent years, due to Japan's southward policy, which is being actively pursued, overseas Chinese have also been hit hard, and their economic power has declined day by day. Now it is only about 65% or so.</p>
<p>In the past, a group of overseas Chinese always believed that our government did not have adequate guarantees, and they took a wait-and-see attitude towards investing in the motherland. Since the end of 1933, when President Sun of the Legislative Yuan visited the Philippines, he vigorously encouraged overseas Chinese to return to the country to invest. In the first half of 1934, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting also visited the Philippines one after another, visiting compatriots in various places and vigorously persuading them to return to the country to invest and revitalize industries. After being encouraged and comforted by these government officials, the overseas Chinese in the Philippines changed their previous wait-and-see attitude and decided to return to the country to invest.</p>
<p>The Preparation Process of China-Philippines Tobacco</p>
<p>Eighteen years ago, overseas Chinese in the Philippines raised 30,000 yuan to establish a "Philippine Overseas Chinese Tobacco Company" in the Philippines. Over the years, the business has been extremely prosperous, with annual profits. Until now, it has expanded to a capital of 10 million Philippine pesos, making it the largest tobacco factory operated by overseas Chinese in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, when Mr. Kuang was in Shanghai, he had several meetings with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and decided to raise 500,000 yuan in national currency to establish the "China-Philippines Tobacco Company" in Shanghai. Among them, 400,000 yuan was subscribed by the Philippine Overseas Chinese Tobacco Company, and the remaining three-quarters were collected by the overseas Chinese in the Philippines. Another 100,000 yuan was reserved for fundraising in China. After they gathered the 500,000 yuan of capital, they began preparations in March last year. On August 20th this year, it was officially announced that the company was established on Qiqihar Road. At the same time, Mr. Lin Zhaopin, who is experienced in the "Philippine Overseas Chinese Tobacco Company", was hired to preside over everything. This "China-Philippines Tobacco Company" is the first time that overseas Chinese from the Philippines have returned to the country to invest. They consider it a trial venture. If the trial results are good, they can then come in a mighty and continuous stream.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the "Philippine Overseas Chinese Tobacco Company" invented three kinds of cigarettes: (1) "Cigarilli," which is the "White House" brand. The U.S. government has granted them a 17-year patent. The governments of Canada and Hong Kong have also granted them exclusive sales rights. The Chinese government has granted a five-year patent. The "Cigarilli" is the most valuable product of the China-Philippines Tobacco Company. (2) "Black Girl." (3) "Hero." These two kinds of cigarettes are now in greater demand than supply because of their good flavor and low price. Most of the tobacco leaves used by the company are shipped from the Philippines, and they are grown by overseas Chinese themselves. One-quarter is purchased domestically, and a very small number is purchased from the United States. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e121">Listening to the Radio Indoors, Suddenly Alerted to a Fire Outdoors <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Carelessness at a firewood shop in Shenjia Alley, Pudong. Total loss reaches over 4,000 yuan.</p>
<p>A firewood shop opened by local resident Pan Shunchang in Shenjia Alley, west of Jiangjia Bridge, Pudong, has a history of three to four decades and is quite prosperous. The shop has three southward-facing tiled bungalows, with two additional rooms in the back, all used for stacking firewood. West of the house and behind it were several large piles of reed firewood. At around 10 o'clock last night, the firewood pile west of the house suddenly caught fire. At that time, Pan and several family members were listening to the radio in the back room and had not yet noticed. A passerby, Mr. Jia, caught sight of the fire and shouted urgently. However, the fire had already spread to the storefront. Pan and the others jumped out of the window to escape. The flames burned more and more fiercely, and in an instant, spread to the firewood piles in the back, becoming uncontrollable. Yang, the chief of the Yangjiadu police station in charge, heard the alarm and urgently telegraphed various fire departments for assistance. At the same time, he personally led police officers to the scene to maintain order. Soon, Zhao, the director of the Pudong Fire Brigade, led his men in a vehicle to rush to the rescue. Subsequently, the Yangjing Fire Brigade arrived to assist. The newly established Laobaidu Fire Brigade also sent a pump truck to the fire scene to extinguish the fire. However, the fire spread quite rapidly. After half an hour, it had spread to the houses along the river to the west, causing fires to burn in two places, with flames reaching the sky. The firefighters had to divide up to fight the fire. However, the order around the fire scene was quite chaotic, so the police persuaded the onlookers to retreat to a farther place. The Security Corps also sent personnel to the scene to maintain order, and the firefighters were able to calmly put out the fire. After burning for about an hour, only one house east of the firewood shop was burned down, and the rest were saved. The houses along the river to the west, except for the three new bungalows at the corner, were completely destroyed. The firefighters continued their efforts, and the fire gradually subsided. However, the fires in the firewood piles were very strong. After fighting the fire until 3:00 AM yesterday, the tide in the river receded. Seeing the situation was not good, Chief Yang immediately ordered the police to obtain a large number of rice bags from a nearby rice store, fill them with mud, and fill the narrower parts of the river mouth to block the tide. By daybreak, the firewood piles were still burning fiercely. After eating their fill, the firefighters gathered their remaining strength and continued to pour water to extinguish the fire. It was not until late last night, when the remaining embers were completely extinguished, that they stopped. The whole process took a long time. In this incident, a stone workshop opened by Gu Jingen, a house inhabited by Wang Shunlin, two rice stores of Xi Shunchang, an oil putty shop of Wang Shunlin, and five firewood shop buildings were destroyed. In addition, two iron shops of Wu Ju's family and half of the firewood shop's eastern neighbor were demolished. Several piles of firewood were also destroyed. The estimated total loss amounted to over 4,000 yuan. As for the cause of the fire, the police station is still unable to ascertain it. The firewood pile was inside the fence outside the house, so it is quite difficult to determine how the disaster occurred. The station questioned the fireman Pan Shunchang yesterday and ordered him to prepare a document for submission to the headquarters for disposal.</p>
