<p>— 都</p>
<p>英記者瓊斯。以壯健有爲之身手。盡披求蒐訪之責任。不憚跋踄躬歷險阻。其銳猛邁往之精神。宜爲吾人所共仰。不幸陷落匪窟。陡失自由。雖經我國當道之竭力營救。取贖條件之往復磋商。卒無補于瓊斯生命之安全。而有寳昌附近撕票之慘果。噩耗傳來。吾人以同業立塲。固不勝其哀悼若就地主關係而論。對茲戾變之造成。尤致無限之歉疚。</p>
<p>瓊斯與德記者穆勒。于前月二十九日在自多倫赴張垣途中爲匪架去。當時情形。迷離惝怳。傳說不詳。迨穆勒自匪窟釋回。乃知匪之目的。全在挾質責贖。我國當局。上自中央政府。下迄寳昌縣長。無不殫智敝慮。亟籌援救。並不惜委曲遝就。與匪作對等之談判。頓兵韜鋩。從事于和平之接洽。徒以匪方要索逾分。遷徙靡定。兼之所距遼邈。情勢錯綜。迄于依違莫得眞際。正當官方躊躇圖維之中。而瓊斯突以遇害聞。此中變化如何。殆難令人索解。要之。我國當局對于營救此異國同業之措置。不可謂不盡最大之努力。巳往之苦心孤詣。宜爲中外所共見。事至末可如何。言之徒增惋歎。死者有知。當能深體我方之衷誠而曲予諒諒解也。</p>
<p>自察東一帶形成特殊局面以來。一切措施。動遭製肘。官方失其控馭之能力。匪徒利爲活躍之淵藪。情勢惡劣。匪伊朝夕瓊斯與穆勒。于七月十一日行抵張垣。聲請游歷內蒙。當地官憲。卽告以萑苻不靖。阻勿前往。而二人意志堅决。甘願簽具切結。必欲冒險前趨。卒啟匪徒之覬覦。召致不幸之事態。蓋匪方明知所匿非軍隊勢力直及之處。而外人爲官廳不甘放棄之票。苟奇貨之可居。宜予取而予求。故一入掌握。不肯放鬆。而外人之游歷其間者。自更增進其危險性。惜乎瓊斯昧于個中究詰。祗憑冒險精神以獲此意外之橫禍也。根據以上所述。吾人對于瓊斯之遇害。可得兩重之敎訓。第一。所謂特殊局面。非唯阻碼行政設施。抑且危及交通安全。予匪氛以坐張潛滋之便。而使中外行旅失其保障。自非速謀恢復統制。寗能復瞻淸明之日。第二。外人之游歷內地者。厥後應絕對遵從中國官廳之指示。而勿復偏矜一時之血氣。須知變故所伏。匪易猝辨。一子失着。全盤皆錯。貽禍之烈。寗有底止自有今回之事。懲前毖後。吾知外僑之踐履斯土者。必且有深切之認識矣。</p>

<p>日本在平組經濟調査團　所謂提携方案業巳到平</p>
<p>北平通訊、日本對於開發華北經濟問題、現又擬一新計劃、由滿鐵各專家、日軍部代表、及僞組織實業界代表、在平設立「華北經濟調査團」、該團組織、分為五班、（一）鐵道班、（二）公路班、（三）礦業班、（四）築港班、（五）商業班、日前來平之經濟調査會第六部主任野中、現已返大連報吿、俟擬有具體成案後、野中再行來平、組織該「華北經濟調査團」、又中日經濟提携問題、當我國駐日大使蔣作賓返國前、日外相廣田、曾數度向蔣提議、該項中日經濟提携方案、日方業已寄平、內容如次、</p>
<p>中日經濟提携、其前提必須根本改善中國國民經濟、大要如下、（一）農業方面、接受日本之技術指導、農產品以增進日本工業之利用價値為要、（地）開發礦業、對於資本技術兩方面、均協力合作、（三）開發交通運輸業之技術資本的合作、（四）紡織業與其他工業方面之合作、（五）設立中日貿易協議會、謀民間之接近、（六）修正中國關稅、恢復中日恊定稅率、</p>
<p>農業</p>
<p>農業為中國國民經濟之基本、生產額年約一百五十萬萬元、若日本予以技術援助為可增加牧入、足可救濟中國國際收支之不均衡、（一）將勵植棉與技術援助中國定世界三大產棉國之一、年約二萬萬餘元之棉花、輸入日本、然植棉知識幼稚、須日本加以改善品質的技術援助、使中國農村與日本紡織界實現共存共榮政策、（甲）中國方面的獎勵植棉、與中國棉花輸出可能性、中國棉花生產量、最近年約一千萬擔、其消費量為九百萬擔、因品質上的關係、每年尙須仰給外國輸入二百萬擔、現國府根據獎勵棉作計畫、擴充棉區為六千萬畝（現為四千萬畝）因此可收獲一千四百萬擔、合消費量一千萬擔、尙有四百萬擔之餘力、然以現在生產品之品質而觀、二三年間、外棉依然有輸入之可能、若中國提高棉花輸入稅、或取銷輸出稅、則中國棉花輸出並不困難、（乙）日本方面、對於改良棉花之設施、在華之日本紡織業者、在山東·河南·湖北·等省、貸予優良綿種、改良棉花、已有相當成績、最近某方在北寗路沿綫、計畫植棉、已調査竣事、正實行一部分、（丙）植棉救國運動、華北近來獨行產業立國政策、因種植小麥小豆利薄、改植有利之棉花、所謂「植棉救國運動」、（二）栽植小麥、中國為世界上第二小麥生產國、但每年有一萬元之小麥入口、日本每年需要加拿大美國及澳洲輸入七千萬元、日本培植小麥、世界所公認為優越、可將日本之技術、指導中國、（三）羊毛、近來日本國內毛織工業發達、羊毛需要量頓增、每年需要一百八十萬擔、大部來自外國、中國羊毛產量、未有精確統計、去年大約有二十五萬噸、大半輸往美國、日本不過輸入一萬二千擔、今後中日雙方努力、使中國羊毛產量增力、（四）其他技術指導、改良農塲、養成農村指導員、實為必要、中國灤東十縣、夙來依賴日本、經某方之介紹、派遺指導員在满鐵農事試騐所實習、此外關於水田灌溉事業、一概由日方指導、關於工業利甩農業原料品之研究棉麥等、日本必要原料之外、植物油豬毛等、可以供工業國之原料、實行集團經濟」、鄰國有優先供給之義務、</p>

<p>紡織</p>
<p>中國紡織業之不振、人所共知、因此、正需要日本之救濟、最近髙級生產品，已　有向日本舫織之勢、此事並不一定於日本不利、要在當事者提携如何、</p>
<p>上述各情、為促成中日經濟之密切、尤其促進中日貿易民間的·精神的·技術的·資本的·接近起見、應援日美·日英·貿易協議會之例、組織「中日貿易協議會」、又昭和八年（民國二十二年）五月中日規定稅率滿期、日本棉織品·海產物·小麥等失去優待、中國之棉花·刺　·絲織品、亦失特殊權益、日貨此　稅率提髙由二成至八成、甚至高至十五成至六十成、如何辯解、終以排日色彩濃厚、未得結果、日方　促中國之覺悟、結果、去年七月、日方要求改定稅率、海產物降低、棉織品减低稅率極少、日方到底不能滿足、最近中國又將全部輸入稅增加、但免除輸出稅·轉口稅·若中日實行經濟提携、自應予以改良、（二十日）</p>

<p>鮮民運銀出關之內幕　奸商機關被破獲數處</p>
<p>北平通信北平市自白銀問題發生迄茲、流出現洋之數字、雖未影響及各銀行之現金準備、然半年來由外埠調集北平之現洋、恐均被一般奸商秘密轉運出境、觀夫每日往來平榆間之平瀋通車、人手一提箱之鮮籍乘客、垣在五六十名左右、間或逾百、日無問斷、就以每人運洋四百元計算、則半年來流出之白銀、其數概可見矣、</p>
<p>平市當局、對於現洋流出之防堵辦法、考慮至再、除一方函請日方對於鮮民私運現洋、隨時協助取締外、另一方面、則注意奸商之偸連、數越月來、此輩奸商狡兎三窟、用計甚密、故彼等之秘密機關、迄未被破獲、據各方面探詢所得、大批鮮民恒往返偸運者、完全為奸商僱用而來、大體每百元所得贏利、作對折或四六及三七分潤、胥視行市為標準、半年以來、此輩奸商所得之利、殆無從數計矣、</p>
<p>北平日使館警察署、疊次在東車站、西直門車站、扣留鮮民所携現洋、為數雖未統計、但可信必不在少、表面雖為鮮民之損失、實際則純係一般奸商之犧牲、所以截留者儘管截留、於私運鮮民、並無利害、雖日對於被截留現洋之處置、尙稱大允、酌量分配與有紙幣發行之各銀行、為數方屬滄海一粟、然藉此可使奸商知所警惕、僱用鮮民、亦不足恃也、</p>

<p>繼續集訊</p>
<p>先由捕房律師蔣保廉聲稱、本月十八日、有餘姚保衛團隊長楊姓、投捕房報吿、謂彼曾接被吿干登來之表兄王新全函云干在滬託其帶庫劵五千元、現欵二千三百元回箱、中途被人詐去一千二百元、及耗由資四十元、尙剩一千另六十元、速同庫券埋於某處塔底等語、該隊長即按址馳往搜査、祇得現欵七百六十元、庫券四千元、至王新全則避匿無踪矣、庭上即訊之被告干登來供、因做公依、</p>
<p>虧損鉅欵</p>
<p>曾乞魏元生帮忙、彼其拒劫、至廿九日、我赴魏家、請求寄寓幾天、嗣魏元生因見報載干雲樵登有缉拿我之廣吿、即催我速投捕房自首、至我晋裕私做公責、則造容戶、共有五名、其中三戶確有其人、我唯假借其名義為公債之交易、此外先記、年記、兩戶實全屬揑造、我因見司事潘全忠舞弊事　、被經埋報吿甫房、自思亦有</p>
<p>舞弊情事</p>
<p>恐一旦發覺、興潘受同等對待、故乘機盜券逃避等語、繼據魏元生供稱、千於七月廿七日來我家時、僅云將赴鄕、要求寄往數天、我情難推却、遂允之、彼乃於二十九日携一皮篋來住居我家三樓、初不知筐藏庫券、後因見報、即迫令投捕房自首、當為僱就汽車、囑車夫須送到捕房、干臨行欲取其所有現欵、我恐其携欵逃逸、故將欵扣留、嗣探員來家査詢干所盜庫券、即至、</p>

<p>乘機盜劵</p>
<p>而逃、故其逃也、可謂係受潘之影響、惟其先將彼存於農工銀行之欵提去、足見預有計劃、至魏元生之牽及、純由於干之供攀、但干今已自承彼之自首、實係魏所主張、就此一點而言、則魏所負嫌疑之程度、巳大减少、應請依法處斷云云、次由晋裕代表律師吳麟坤陳述對干登來私訴之標的、（一）庫券一千元、（二）現金一千五百四十元、（三）干揑造客戶</p>
<p>私做公債</p>
<p>欠欽二千八百卅二元八角五分、末由江一平律師爲魏元生辯白、謂魏今不幸為干誣攀、致亦處被吿地位、然就干所供涉及於魏者而觀、巳屬矛盾百出、殊難置信、如干稱彼於廿七日往與魏言、將於二十九日向銀行收取公債等語、該號經理决不致於兩日前以收公債事語干、彼既不知、從何與魏言、此其一、干又供彼到魏家、即將庫券交給於魏、彼之盜券、由於投機失敗、虧負巨資、故寗干冒法紀、豈肯將</p>
<p>犯法得來</p>
<p>之財產、輕易付諸他人、干非至愚、必不為此、此其二、設魏對於干之遠法行為、果屬知情、願加恊助、則决不嚴催自首、必縱之使逸、而魏亦儘可乾屯該項庫劵、今魏不獨着千自首、且特為催汽車囑衘者載置捕房、一面將干所欲取去之現金、予以截留、干以欲逃不得、致全盤計劃、被魏破壞無餘、恨魏實甚、故於投捕房誣魏同謀、此其三、至魏之留干暫住、事屬朋友恒情、更不便</p>
<p>先加盤問</p>
<p>及見報載、即毅然予吿訴人以種種助力、俾其少受不法之損害、是魏之態度光明、舉動磊落、不但無國、而且有功、乃今反被牽連公訴、寗為事理之平、應請宣告魏元生無罪、庶使天下之好鳴捕平者、不致灰心云云、此一篇滔滔雄辯、頗是種廳、庭上於啟滸畢、遵論干登來滬押、魏元生仍交原舖保出外、候下星期三宣判、</p>

<p>— （宛廬）</p>
<p>事事物物都有一個顯著面，和一個黑黯面，普通人，是只見顯著面，而不去研究它的黑黯面，聰明人，看顯著面，同時也要窺探黑黯面，另有一種人，恰與普通人相反，專看黑黯面，而不去理會顯著面，齊通人的看法，固然是太淺陋了，專看黑黯面的，也未免太掃興，祇有兩面全看的人，即不會上當，也不會掃興，拿上海來說吧，專門欣賞霓虹燈的光彩，是不命認識上海的，專門研究南京路倒閉了的商店共有多少，每天報紙上載着自殺的人共有多少，這種認識的方法，也不正確，所以要兩面都看到，才算聰明人，才會眞芷認識了上海。</p>
<p>天下事，最好帶三分糊塗，才有意思，你如果把什麽都看穿了的話，那一點樂趣都沒有哩，醫如你正當卿卿我我的時候，忽然想起紅粉骷髏的景像，平空一個寒噤，會把柔情密意，霎時間飛到　霄雲外，譬如你正在盤算着那一筆錢該到期了，那一份產業，該整理了，滿腦子花花綠綠的鈔票兒亂泛，你忽然想起無常一到萬事全休的况味，會把全副精神，降到永點，所以說：有一分糊塗，有一分福氣，多一分聰明，多一分折磨。</p>

<p>— 顧佛影自東京寄</p>
<p>國內報載，有某外籍水利專家言：中國近來治水方法，專事防隄，實屬非計，以後應該多注意於疏濬，這話自然不錯，不過疏濬也還是治標之策，所謂治水的根本方法惟有治林，因為樹木能够涵蓄水分，調節兩暘，這是極淺顯的道理，可不用多說。</p>
<p>我此次到日本，特別注意他們的林政，曾經視察過好幾個林塲，在北海道還親自爬過幾個山頭，在札幌道廳拓殖部等處收集到許多計劃書報吿書和表格，仔細研究之下，覺得我國現在的林政設施全部摹倣日本，實在是大錯誤。他們地方小，經費足，人材多，又已有了相當的成績，現在自然只有試騐研究改良的工作了。但在我國，情形剛巧相反，政府丟着幾千萬的童山不去造林，却只學着他們辦試騐塲，成績好壞，姑且不論，卽使你十年二十年後會有試騐出某種樹木的吸水量若干蒸發量若干的時候，也許一塲大水，早連你的試騐塲都送進水晶宮去了。肚子餓，應該用大餅油條塞飽了再說，那鷄蛋糕昨製造法等等，慢些研究又何妨。</p>
<p>我的意思，目下政府只要下一個决心，粗粗的擬定一個實施綱要，（只要粗粗的，因為一求精密，必然又是聚訟不决，而事實上寒帶樹種到溫帶來，也不見得就死），如某處應植某幾種樹木之類，通令全國，各在一定區域內設一苗圃，一二年後，苗木培成，便全國總動員，限定每人須種樹幾株，違者重罰，卽使每人只種十株，四萬人也有四十萬萬株，每株占地一方丈，便有六千萬餘畝的面積，而所需經費實在微乎其微。老實說一句，種樹是人人會的，不比開機器要有熟練的技術，也不比種蔬菜要有精密的管理，只要揷了下去不再拔起來，他自己會生長。我國有了六千萬畝以上的大林塲，二十年後，水旱之災，至少减輕一半，這是我可以根據科學來保證的。至於試騐研究的林學專家將來自然還得借重，不過有了頭髮纔用得着木梳呵。</p>

<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>社會上種種無益的事，雖然在努力地改革，可是一般民衆迷信神權的心理，依然建築得很為堅固，給社會改進者一個重大的阻礙！</p>
<p>移風易俗推行的手續，本不容易發生迅速的效果，像上海社會公安兩局，對於破除迷信，歷年以來，總算十分努力的進行，但是一到七月中，各弄口打醮的風氣，仍很囂張，東也如此，西也這般，委實是沒有辦法！把許多有用的金錢，化在虛無縹緲之鄉，眞是可惜得很</p>
<p>上海一部分化去的錢已有可觀，綜計全國化在迷信上的錢，數目是很驚人了。今年他們重申禁令，切實勸導民衆，再不要妄行這種無益的舉動，想來此風一定可以稍殺。外埠的各鄉各鎭，在這七月鬼的季節內，隨處可以見到鼓鈸喧天，香烟繚繞。更大量的燒化楮帛，據說是救濟一般無依孤魂，免得與人作祟，保佑人口平安，實在愚妄得可笑。</p>
<p>去年鬧了一個嚴重的旱荒；今歲又釀成了大水災，弄得災民載道，無處容身，閉目一想，覺得如許災民都在亟待救濟。現在我們人人應該節衣縮食，把省下的錢來以振災黎，倘把全國的打醮費，移作振欵，不是更功德無量嗎？我願為災民請命，希望大家起來提倡！</p>

<p>— 吳愛伯</p>
<p>我們平常經過理髮店門口，不是看見有一根三色的圓柱子，在那裏不停的轉動嗎？這根三色的圓柱子，是理髮店唯一的標識，隨便什麽人，都沒有不知道的。可是要尋根究底査考他的來歷，恐怕　有許多人不大明白吧。</p>
<p>前幾天，我到一家舊書店裏去坐談，無意之中，看見一本「旅美觀察談」，是王一之先生做的。他這本書的前面，有本報前總經理史量才先生和陳冷先生的相片同序文，當時引動了我的好奇心，便把他翻開來一看。在這本書的一三四面，王先生有談到此事，他的解釋如下</p>
<p>理髮店門前捲旋不息之圓柱，周圍塗漆，狀似紅白黑三色帶，斜上廻繞，一經電力旋動，最足引人注目。此種風習，係由歐洲傳入，歐洲古代，理髮師嘗兼外科醫生，此項捲旋不息之圓柱，所以有紅白黑三條紋者，實因古時醫士療臂傷所用之各色裏傷布，常裂為極細長條故也。觀於今日醫院中之綳帶，可見一斑。</p>
<p>以上是王一之君所說，看來是很詳細的了。不曉得還有其他的說法沒有，這是要請讀者諸君指敎的。</p>

<p>倒是他身邊，站着一位太太，不過三十來歲，燙着頭髮，穿着高跟鞋，旗袍瘦瘦的拖平了脚背，很是摩登。大家看到了這種情形，都不免失望，殊不料大事誧張的歡迎，不過歡迎着這麽一位先生來了。可是張介夫卻與普通人的心理相反，他是更加着一層熱烈，遠遠看到專員汽車到了，便是紅光滿面，手上取下帽子，站在大門邊，垂手直立。見藍專員快到了門口，不敢怠慢，立刻搶步向前，正對了他，深深的三個鞠躬。那專員忽然看到有人搶來行禮，也有些愕然，不過心裏猜着，總也是本地的歡迎代表，决不能够跑出一個攔與吿狀的，因之在百忙中站定，也就連連點了兩個頭。介夫見他站定，而且又點了兩個頭，不由得心花怒放，於是彎着腰，笑嘻嘻的由身上掏出一張名片，舉肴送了過去。藍專員接過去一看，是個陌生的名字，又沒有官銜，不知道究竟是那一個機關的，只得哦了一聲，點頭道，回頭再詳談罷。介夫說了兩個是，倒退了兩步。藍專員陪着太太，向小西天裏面走，介夫也隨着向裏面。這一下子，彷彿身上的骨頭，立刻加重了好幾斤，舉起步子來走路，非常的沉着。眼睛向兩邊看熱鬧的人，胸挺了起來，好像暗示着人，你看我也同着專員在一路走呢。尤其是走進了小西天看到一班相識的旅客，更是不住的，由嘴角上露出笑容來。那意思又是說，我歡迎藍專員不是偶然的吧？因為如此，別人也就果然相信他是藍專員的親戚了。（二九六）</p>

<p>太后搽胭脂又是怎樣搽法的呢？</p>
<p>伊先把剪下的一小方紅絲棉在一杯溫水中浸了一浸，便取出來在兩個手掌的掌心裏輕輕的擦着，擦到伊自己覺得已經滿意了，這才停止；因為從前的女人，掌心上總是搽的很紅的，所以太后第一步也是搽掌心。掌心搽好，才搽兩頰；這時候伊可沒工夫再和我說話了，伊把伊的臉和鏡子凑得非常的近，並用極度的小心搽着，以期不太濃也不太花，正好適宜為度。最後才是點唇；不過從前的人决不像現在的人一樣的把上下唇的全部統搽上口紅，伊們是只在唇的中間搽上一點胭脂，恐怕就是受着文人『櫻桃小口」的一句形容詞的支配罷（三九六）</p>

<p>— 薜繼羣</p>
<p>前幾天在一家親戚家裏應酬，席間有位在食品界裏服務的王先生，與我閑譚，他說：現在的生意眞難做，吃客都愈加精明，成本，一年比一年大，不論一件什麽東西，凡是我們食品公司的出品，或是自己發明的，或是仿照西洋製迭的，或者向來是江浙一帶的著名特產，到如今別說同行要搶生意，競爭。即使專做批發，或是專販來路貨的，一打聽那件買賣好佔光些，就會你仿我學的做起來，在吃客方貨，同行有了競爭，比較比較，自然是優勝劣敗，大家都往好的那家去了，可是，在我們設身處地做這行生意，那才要呌苦呢。此刻，不講別的，就拿上海一埠的餅乾事業來說，餅乾，在食品界也是一椿件子」小本錢是做不好的，向來，除了來路貨裝聽子的東西不計外，上海有兩家如『沙利文」等洋商，設廠在本埠製造的，國產方面，有『馬　山，」「泰豐，」「泰康，」「冠生園」等幾家比較範圍大，出品多，銷路到也不差。說起冠生園，我們茲來曉得在十餘年前，還是一家開在九畝地專賣陳皮梅結汁牛肉的小舖子，那知不到二十年工夫，由一家而分了幾家，從上海而蘇，杭，寗，漢，平，津，港，粵，支店不下十餘家，分銷一百餘處，營業蒸蒸，資本巳增加至五十萬元，他們的工廠，一向是在滬南的局門路，總理冼冠生君，耐勞刻苦，數十年如一日，不論一椿什麽事，或是一樣細小的出品，他必定要親自嘗試，親自研求。為了糖果和餅乾的精進起見，他同廠裏的餅乾部主任王常源君，還到過三島去考察過幾次，旋鑒於廠基的不敷應用，和人工的遠不如機製的迅捷，於是，在前兩年到漕河涇去買了四十多畝地，闢一半作農塲，半則自建五層鋼骨水泥的巨廈，還到法國去定了一部最新式最經濟的機器，經過長時期的規劃經營，現在是已樂觀厥成了。工廠坐辦趙澤民君跟冼君每天的上漕河涇，此刻，先把餅乾部從舊廠搬去，機器已經裝竣，還聘了幾位專門技師生火開車，出品大佳。據王常源君負責的談話，譬如本來每天用一躉煤，烘成的餅乾，不過一千磅，現在，那新機器試車以來，太便宜了，一躉煤可以用三四天而出品的細淨餅乾，烘得透，製迭快，作料重，味道好，比以前要多五倍的貨色，而所耗的煤反而省了十分之六七，人工又省，成本比較輕了。出品方面，舉凡早茶，牛乳，夾心，梳打，等名目不下二三十種，他們的定價，取薄利多賣主義，原料步步提高，滋味取和平中正，雖未能自誇獨步，但，舶來品却視為一個勁敵了。</p>
<p>我們現在正在耳邊聽到的，不是都在鬧不景氣嗎？那知在這潮流中，居然有這樣一家冠生園餅乾工廠來擴展發揚，是値得來提倡和介紹的。如此，我們希望他們的出品，永久的向前邁進，則前程的成就是未可限量的，而更希望別的國產廠家，都能跟着他們那樣的埋頭苦幹，本在本身上努力，不作無　的誇張，那末，先總理的「民生」主義，就不難實現了。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>美國駐華老商務參贊安諾德先生，吾數次和他談話，他總是說中國貨的好處中國貨有無窮的希望。這次他在上海扶輪會講演，說的話，越加透澈，八月十八日本報蔭良先生節譯的一段，使人讀了，不由地發生無限的感慨，和無限的企望。他說：『國貨所以不能和別人競爭的原因，一方面固然因為不能改良，不用新方法經營，一方面也是因為中國人自己先不用，外國貨自然也不去用他了。可舉幾個例：數星期前，吾跟美國經濟考察團到廣州去，銀行界假座一個中國旅館歡迎，席中所用的，完全是外國茶葉。廣州商會歡迎時用中國茶，照外國喝法，用極好的紅茶，把牛乳冲淡，完全失却華茶的意味。有人提議，請考察團設法推廣華茶，我們就謂他把華茶先在中國社會推廣，有時在中國的旅館裏，中國的火車裏，中國的俱樂部裏，簡直找小到一些華茶，這樣不給外國人喝中國茶，不給外國人喝到中國茶的好處，如何使他們來買中國茶呢？這話是何等的爽快澈底，所以蔭良先生提要的說：「要使外國人用中國貨，先要把中國貨改良，中國人自己用起來。」就吾所知，目下一般不爭氣不要臉的中國人，還是迷信洋貨，樂用洋貨，有某機關竟公然說：我們向來不用國貨，這種反常態度，不知是何居心？最近大中華橡膠廠倡製了汽車輪胎，出品可說和外貨不分上下，各公路熱心採用的很多，聽說有一個什麽會，無論如何，不肯採用他，這種仇視國貨的分子，他是否已經忘却身為中國人。啊喲中國人自己先不信任國貨，愛用國貨，國家還有什麽希望？橡膠輪胎不過國貨的一種，此外如吃的，喝的，用的，穿的，倘能大家拿出良心來，先把他漸漸改良，自己先用起來，那麽國貨前途才有一綫希望。」</p>
<h3 id="c198">儉約運動與國貨 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>國人崇拜洋貨心理的高築，和奢侈生活的養成，這本是年來我國龐大入超的大原因，同時，我們在眼前，能够努力儉約運動和提倡國貨的進行，這却也正是挽救時艱的一個唯一動向。</p>
<p>大家曉得，自從帝國主義的商品，衝破我們的閉關自守政策以後，一方面由於西洋的物質文明，漸漸輸入國內，同時，幾個工業先進國家的貨物，就先到我國的各處的都市，開始他傾銷的手腕，於是，使生產落後，沒有見過機製物品的我們，起了重大的誘惑，而他的結果，就在我們大衆的生活上，無論是精神的，物質的，都傾向洋化和奢侈的享用，並產生了大批洋貨推銷員，造成了年來國內經濟崩潰，工商破產的根基。</p>
<p>我們試向現社會上的人們，細細地看一看，在目下，過着洋俗和奢侈生活的，是如何充斥，一般資產階級們，果是衣必舶來，食必歐化，住必洋房，出必汽車，甚至連化妝品，文具等，也是非洋不辦，然而再看看中下之家呢？他們也因受了上層社會者的影響，雖然一個依賴二三十塊錢維持生活的薪水階級，他們做丈夫的，却也一定要西裝革履起來，做主婦的，必更要燙髮，畫眉，染指，旗袍，高跟鞋，好像非此不足以自榮的樣子，但是，出另一方面，入超激增，年年有驚人的漏卮，國家一天天地貧弱下去，這何嘗不就是他們的賜給。並且，卽使就他們個人方而看，近來我們不是常常聽到「失業」「自殺」嗎？究其因，却無非都是因受了家庭生活太奢侈化的結果，經濟壓迫，致事業失敗，人格墮洛，而趨向到這最後的末運去。</p>
<p>所以，我深深地覺得在目前的熱烈提倡國貨口號下，同時有努力儉約運動的必要，記得新生活運動中，已把國貨運動和儉約救國二者同樣列入，我們是要十分遵循的，最近本市社會局和許多團體，也都有提倡儉終運動的呼聲，這種意見和動向，是很正確的，在這民窮財盡的時候，我希望大家不要再度那洋化和奢侈的生活，相反的要替國貨前途謀出路呵！</p>

<p>輓近以降，可說是商業戰爭時代，要自己貨品暢銷，賺別人的錢，第一要講究貨品道地，合乎時代的需求，但旣已達到目的，還要怕別人仿造假冒，因此加上一個商標，就可以互相識別了。國人自提倡國貨以來，製造出品，日增月盛，日常需用品，可說應有盡有。而各貨俱有登記商標，以資識別。為此，國人本愛國心購買國貨時，牢記國貨商標也是一個比較便利的方法。</p>
<p>商標普通叫牌子，一提起某種牌子的貨品，便會連想到某種牌子的品質如何。譬如固本肥皂，便知道牠去垢耐用，無損衣服；「三角牌西湖毛巾」，便知道牠質地柔軟，吸水力强：「無敵牌牙粉」，便知道牠能潔牙固齒，氣味芬芳，「雙十牌牙刷」，便知道牠刷牙舒服，一毛不拔，立鶴牌面盆便知道他的漂亮耐用。牢記國貨商標，便是信用國貨的明證；國人若能個個如此，還怕國貨不暢銷麽？</p>
<p>以上所提到的，不過幾種著名的國貨商標，若進而至於各種需用品的國貨商標都能牢記，那麽當自己沒有工夫去購買時，就是差遺佣僕，也只銷說明貨品與商標，斷不致錯誤；就是有些慣銷洋貨的商店，也難以施其伎倆，而以洋貨冒充國貨了！</p>
<p>要實行牢記國貨商標的方法，在家庭中自然應由做父母的來提倡，當每逢購買一種貨品時，除本人牢記着外，還須指明兒女，這是什麼東西，叫什麼牌子商標，是某國貨工廠的出品，廠名或記不得這許多，不過牌子定要給他們牢記的。在學校中自然應由敎員來提倡，尤其在小學中，因中學生已能自己識別了。或有時舉行測騐，叫他們說出國貨的商標名，或在游戲操時，譬如演「穿龍門」時，普通每個人報個花名或鳥名，如今叫他們來報個國貨商標名，也是怪有趣味的。總之，要牢記國貨商標的方法儘有，惟在國人努力實行之而已！</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>此次新藥業因成藥登記問題，推舉周邦俊許曉初等赴京向衛生署面陳意見，予亦同往，本報駐京記者秦墨哂君，邀遊總理陵園，乘便謁譚墓而赴靈谷寺，訪建築陣亡將士公墓委員會主席許朋非，許君係浙江吳興人，與陳英士先烈茶莫逆，性頗爽直，談及提倡國貨問題，渠舉一故事，而證明日本人之熱心毅力，有一記之價値。並非予長他人志氣，而滅自己威風，事實如是，希望嗜用外貨之同胞，閱後相互效法，則國難雖嚴重，未始不可挽救，否則徒在嘴上提倡，不能坐言起行，現銀有限，總有漏盡之日，强鄰卽不以鎗砲逼我，我因經濟枯竭，如人之患貧血症然，不受外感，亦欲自斃。許君言：淸季余已改裝，隨中山先生在日本時，一日擬辦春季西裝一套，赴市上看貨，見多數商店，僉定價二十八元，旋發現有一商店，定價僅二十元，且同樣之料，價格低者反較價格高者之貨精細，遂在此店內定製一套，星期日價日本友朋相聚時，見渠等所穿之料，均較予所穿者粗，詢以價格，一律稱二十八元，以予所穿者相比較，渠等亦承認價廉物美，詢予在何處購辦，告以地址店號，渠等皆曰以足下打算，自然在是店購辦最宜，蓋是店之料，係外國貨，我等所穿者皆日本貨，足下是中國人，自然揀便宜人家採辦，我等而亦不用本國貨，則本國呢羢永無精進之日，利權外溢，其害不堪設想。雖明知本國貨較外國貨價貴貨劣，亦當忍痛提倡，試問如貪美觀而欲便宜，二十元做一套西裝，些二十元完全流入外國，現在以二十八元買一套本國貨西裝，每人多耗八元，其數尙微，以全國計算，數目甚大，本國呢羢業因銷路廣，而有盈餘，則對於製造上，亦逐漸改良，不患不能做到價廉物美四字，而與外貨爭衡。故我等情願出重價，而購質地較劣之貨，雖忍痛一時，然希望無窮。余當時聽渠等所述，深佩其目光遠大，迄今二十餘年，每覩日本貨較前進步，而價格低廉，時常要想到當時談話之景况，故予卽在是年起，亦立志不用外貨，現已習慣成自然，並不感覺到中國貨之不能用。奈一般時髦朋友，沾染歐化者，往往以為中國貨質地功效不及外貨，而價値並不低廉，咸不屑用，大家不用，銷數不多，卽不倒閉，亦不過勉强維持，安能望其改良。希望足下將此意旨在申報國貨週刋上宣布，對於提倡國貨不無小補，予佩其熱忱，特表而出之，以吿讀者。</p>
<h3 id="c201">提倡國貨全憑良心 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>本來是，一個人在世界上做事情，無論做的是什麼事情，都得憑良心，纔可以做得好。豈獨『提倡國貨』而然哉？</p>
<p>不過，我這篇東西，是寫給「國貨週刊』的。所以，便專就『提倡國貨』這一件事情來說說。</p>
<p>我們知道，『提倡國貨』這一件事情，不自今日始，實在已經鬧了許久了。但是，成績之糟，是每况愈下！到如今我們不必求「洋貨』不『入超』只要求『洋物入超』的數目的只减不加，尙且不可能！遑論『國貨』能彀「出超』？這樣的情形，『提倡國貨』，簡直是紙上空談！數十年來以迄於今日，都是如此，何怪國計民生，一天不如一天呢？唉！這……這……這……其間究竟是何緣故呢？仔細想來，這全然是各人的「良心』問題啊</p>
<p>因為，一個人有了『良心』，便任何事都做得好。『提倡國貨』，也是這這樣。如果，你有「良心』的話，那你說『提倡國貨』，一定是眞心誠意，不會騙人的。自然，說得到，做得到。否則，『提倡國貨』，嘴上儘管好聽，無奈口是心非。着的；吃的；喝的；吸的；以及用的一切，背地裏依然無一不是「洋貨』！這種自欺欺人的勾當，實在是沒有信義。一個人沒有信義，還有什麽『良心』？唯其沒有「良心」，纔會販賣『洋貨』。唯其沒有『良心』，纔會購用「洋貨」。這樣提倡『國貨」，試問焉得不糟？所以，在下要在這裏嚕囌的說：「提倡國貨，全憑良心』。無非要希望大家此後提倡『國貨』，要拿出『良心」來！</p>
<h3 id="c202">稻草製報紙的計畫（上） <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>造報紙之機器。不成問題。譬如燒小菜。只在做手。不必定購電爐煤氣灶也。現成所有。如龍章天章之平廉機，均可兩面使光。至於卷筒式者。則機上本出卷筒。更無難處。所難者。紙漿問題耳。稻草製漿，造紙，就愚兄弟二人。十餘年來之實騐。可謂早已成功。惟在城市收買稻草。殊不合算。一元僅得三担左右。故不能與外國報紙爭廉。但在農村造漿。則挑運之力可省，卽其成本廉過三分之二，且不第造報紙。並可以草漿銷出國外。試就江北言之。</p>
<p>曩據友人述悉東台鹽城等處。稻草每元可購八擔。麥草倍之。惟裝船到滬。則大不合算。因其價値太賤。船價反比草價昂也。以裝棉花比例。一船裝三百餘擔。川捐包凈需九十元。行程乃需一月。若奘稻草無須捐稅。則船價可廉。約六十元。以容三百擔論。卽每擔川運之費。已需二角。加以草價一角二分半。與上海浦東一元三擔之價相同。惟在崇明海門等處。稻草之價雖祇每元兩擔半。但其所用之秤。實與石灰窰秤相同。每斤核天平廿二兩。則每元核得三百四十餘斤。亦與無錫之一元三擔半。相等矣。予因鑒於川運之難。愈覺東臺等處就地製漿。實為有極大之利源可闢。且最合於經濟。蓋以稻草製漿。每四千斤成一噸。每船可裝廿噸。卽不啻以三船之草併裝一船。運費可省三分之二矣。每以六十元一船論。卽每噸川資不過二元。加以草價五元。共祇七元。應用石灰。可由空船帶轉。但如加以水脚不合其時。可以硫化碱代之。每桶六十磅。現價三元五角。可製一噸半之草漿。是則廿噸草漿所用。但有十四桶足矣。總董不及六擔。川運之費亦以二角一擔論。不過一元二角。每船統計廿噸。連同草價一應。其成本不過二百十一元八角。售十四元四角一噸。可得二百八十八元。卽獲凈利七十六元二角。若照拙擬。由農村合作社社。提倡小組工塲。每以四十人操作。卽每日能出五噸。如有一百六十人工作。卽每日可以裝出一船。每月可出六百噸。售八千六百四十元。除墊付一百六十人預支各四十元計六百四十元。川資一千八百元。石灰或硫化一千五百四十四元。共計三千九百八十四元。得餘三千六百五十六元。除提合作社開支一成外。餘作三千二百元。卽每人派得二十元。連同預支十元。已得三十元矣。所需之草共計二萬四千擔，以一百六十人分擔之。卽每人每月出草一百五十擔。原售一元八擔。所得不過十八元七角五分。今得三十元。是在每人生活費。每月可以多出十一元二角五分。足供老小二人之飯食。是操作者雖祇一百六十人。然以二十元。足供五口十之食論。亦足以使八百孤寒不號饑矣。若恐稻草缺乏。可以田畝計之。每畝平均以十擔論。但有三萬畝田。已足供其長年操作，每以二人耕田四十畝論，是業農者當有千五百人，今為工者不過十分之一，若在農閒操作，則每年之中，每人操作一月，亦已綽乎有餘，惟如操作一時，卽其墊本約需五萬，非有銀行扶助不可，若論銷路，則七千二百噸之總量，僅足以供一家紙板廠耳，售出草漿總價，則七千二百噸，可得十萬餘元，合作社提一成時，已得一萬，應付銀行拆息，以按月一分計，逐月售出歸還，以每月八千元計，在初三個月作放帳論，聽出利息一千五百元，至第四月卽已還出二萬四千元，則聽出利息，不過二百六十元矣，第五月又還八千，則聽息僅一百六十元，第六月又還八千，聽息祇須八十元，第七月則已全數淸償，是其所聽之息，總共不過二千，尙餘八千元，派給社員及理事監事等之酬勞，亦可觀矣。</p>

<h3 id="c217">海洋的描繪 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 白苧</p>
<p>因為自己是喜歡海洋的人，所以對於描繪海洋的文字，也特別的愛好着。常以為海洋的美總是隨着觀者的心境而變幻，有時是愛撫的慈母，有時是一個睡眠的嬰兒，有時又似呑噬一切的暴君或魔鬼。有人說海包藏着許多秘密，可以吿訴人以他所不知道的東西。這種說法，在我面對着海洋或讀到描繪海洋的文字時想來，是毫不覺得過分的。</p>
<p>過去最使我愛讀的，是丹農　烏的一死之勝利」一書中描寫海洋的一段，寫一個臨死的人，在海濱的星空下聽海波的呼嘯，而引起種種離奇的幻覺。雖然取着小說的形式，但讀起來正如一篇想像豐富書調鏗鏘的散文詩，BurtonRaicoe說他的文字想像豐富描寫確當，這話就能在這篇文字中看出例證。海的怒吼與低泣，夢境的迷惘，死的威嚇，和出現於黃昏時的暮色的莊嚴，在字裏行間織成一幅最妖艷最神秘的圖畫。他寫着在七月的醇潔的丁香色天幕之下，緩緩展開的海的諧樂。又用擬人法來寫海的憤怒，嫉妬，謙抑，潦倒，嘲諷，撫慰，呻　，祈禱，種種行為。他的描繪是華飾的，不吝惜地把可能用的新字眼和形容詞都用進去。</p>
<p>和他相反的，高爾基，對於海雖也用着擬人的刻畫，但全是素樸的，他用的古怪字眼很少，只如淡水彩畫那麼略略鈎勒上幾筆，便在紙上現出個生動的形象。如瑪爾伐，如一個人的誕生諸作品，為海時，所採用的全是最經濟最有效的浮雕式的手法。他似乎看到海洋之美的某幾個要點，專抓住這要點表現出來遺棄了那不値得寫的糟粕東西，景物的美便集中在這幾句話的範圍裏。。他寫「海笑着』，又寫「海騰着快活的波濤』，這種使人神往的「健康的笑」，也正象徵着這甦生期的巨人的心境。素凈，單純，有力，正表現着新文學特具的優點。</p>
<p>有些較舊的作家，其描寫海洋手法的優越，仍是不能被我們所遺忘的。如最近為人譯出的洛諦的冰島漁夫，把海寫得神秘得可愛，同時又凄凍得可怖；迴環描畫中，透出一種北歐的　　氣分。每章都如逐漸舖張開的圖畫券軌。寫海又沒忘記寫那海上的人，因之他筆下不僅傅出人與自然力的抗爭，也還有從人的心理角度上視出去的海的另一面目，寫出那從外界所取來的全體的色彩，但却被反映於內界，而同時對心情予以同一的調子。</p>
<p>從前看過一本伊本納茲的『我們的海』，其中寫歐戰中一個女間諜的活動，為到海中許多古怪的東西，那寫得就未免單調。此外使我不忍釋的是小泉八雲的一篇海濱看太陽初昇的散文很大氣力來形容那旭日，那旭日下的海波和帆影。雖然所寫環境和高爾基所寫的沒什麽兩樣，但情調却全異其趣。高爾基對於海，有的是富有生命力的浪漫性的誇張；而小泉八雲，却只用了抒情詩的調子平靜地舖叙出那戀歌神話般的境界，給人帶來一種朦朧而委婉的詩趣。前者是對於『自然力』之『野性的號呼』，後者則只是一偭冥想的詩人流連景物之作而巳。生活之决定作品，有如此者。</p>
<p>古往今來不知有多少作者費他們的心血於海洋的描繪上，要說也說不盡，但我們現在所要求的，不是沉醉於海洋的妙景中作神秘冥想的詩人，而是能從一切偉大事物中看出了「新生的萌芽」的歌手，來歌頌並描繪那「中國海的怒潮」！</p>
<h3 id="c218">「詞兒」構成底分析 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 汪馥泉</p>
<p>不論用「注音字母」也吧，用國語羅馬字也吧，用國語拉丁字也吧，「詞兒』底寫定，改造及創制，是一個共同的某本的問題。</p>
<p>這里，我們試就詞兒底構成，加以分析。（當然，這只是一個發端而已。）</p>
<p>（一）意義相同的—王引之『經義述聞』卷三十二『通說下』『經傳平列二字上下同義」條：「引之謹案：古人訓詁，不避重複，往往有平列二字，上下同意者，解者分為二義，反失其指。如『泰象傳』『后以裁成天地之道，輔相天地之宜。」……裁與成同義……輔與相同義。『隨象傳』『君子以嚮晦入宴息。」……宴之言安，安與息同義。……」如道路，遮蔽，居住，離散，疲倦，顚倒，賓客，懼怕，傾覆等都是。</p>
<p>也有意義相同的兩個詞，構成為一個詞之後，其意義或者不變或者轉變了的，如　目一詞，可以作眼睛解，如「眼目淸凉」；也可以作主要處解如『傳燈錄』「夫參學眼目，臨機直須大用。」</p>
<p>（二）意義相類的—把意義相類的兩個詞，構成為一個詞的，可以分為兩類；一類是，構成為一個詞之後，其意義楚將相類的兩個意義都包括了進去的；一類是，成為一個詞之後，其意義已轉變了，</p>
<p>前者，如詩歌，歌謠，姿容，禮儀，法則，法律，刑罰，筵席等。</p>
<p>後者，如柴米，衣食是指日用；筆墨指詩文，褚墨指寫字需用的東西，紙筆指契據：衣冠可以指臣子，冕旒可以指君上；絲竹指音樂；干戈指戰爭；木石指無知覺的東西（『孟子』『與木石居。』）（以上所舉，即修辭學上所謂『借代格』。』</p>
<p>（三）意義相反的——如大小，左右，好歹，雌雄，買賣，借貸，勝負，多寡，賞罰，陰陽，深淺，生死，長短等。這一種，也可以分為兩類，也是一類包括兩個意義，一類轉變了意義的。但是，雖說一類包括兩個意義，却也稍稍轉變了的，如「决個勝負」，可以解作决定個你負我負，我負你勝，也可以解作打一仗。如「還多寡有幾兩選金和幾十本樣本送與先生」，這多寡可以解作多多少少何幾兩……云云，也可以解作總有幾兩……云云</p>
<p>後一類，如「一决雌雄」，是一决勝負的意思。「假使有個長短」，是說假使一個人有個「三長兩短」（即「死」）的意思。「只是我要往一個朋友處借貸」，這裏只是借，沒有貸。「現在是一個存亡關頭」，這是說將亡的時候。「通個緩急」，是吿急的時候。</p>
<p>這裏，還有一種構成方法的，便是被構成的兩個詞底意義，並不相類，也並不相反，却是對待的。如東西，規炬，水火，父子等。構成後，意義已完全轉變。「不辨東西」，是不知道力向的意思（東西，也作」物事」解）。一不懂規矩」，這個規矩，變成禮貌了。水火，是說「物性之相克」，父子，「含嗣續相承之義」。</p>
<p>（四）重疊詞——如爸爸，媽媽，哥哥，弟弟，太太，奶奶，漸漸，往往，單單，常常，哈哈，玩玩，走走，坐坐，天天，剛剛等。「詩經」第一首第一句（「關關睢鳩」），便是一個例。李淸照「聲聲慢」詞中的「尋尋，覓覓，哈哈，淸淸，悽悽，慘慘，戚戚」赴有名的例子</p>
<p>（五）由於雙聲的——如彷彿，躊躇，流離，山水，悒　，古今，加减，規矩，陰陽等。</p>
<p>（六）由於疊韻的　如徘徊，糊塗，荒唐，朦朧，從容，窈窕，糢糊，水火，老幼，好醜等</p>
<p>這第五第六兩項，在數量上是很多的。（由于聲韻的關係拂成的詞兒，這里有一點，是得帶便述及的，便是章太炎底「一字重音說』。「如「說交」人部有『焦僥』，僥，本字也，焦則借音字；何以不兼造樵，則知僥字兼有焦僥二音也。』）</p>
<p>（七）類名加區別詞—類名加區別詞，可以分爲兩類：一，在類名之上；二，在類名之下。</p>
<p>前者，如科學家，文學家，軍閥，學閥，字典，辭典，鈔票，當票，大狗，小狗，包車夫，汽車夫，白馬，黑馬。</p>
<p>後者，如眼淚，眼球，電燈，電話，女學校，女博士，文章，文學。</p>
<p>（八）本詞加發語字或收語字—加發語字，如阿公，阿婆，阿叔，阿姊，阿姨，又如老兄，老伯，老大，老二，老張，老王。</p>
<p>加收語字，如窗子，褲子，墊子，刀子，扇子，桌子，兒子，女子，妻子。又如瓶兒，盆兒，鳥兒，要子兒，孩兒，（杭州話中兒的收語字很多。）又如木頭，拳頭，鼻頭，（也作鼻子），釘頭（也作釘子），紙頭，罐頭，鈕頭。</p>
<p>（九）街頭語及接尾語—這與第七第八兩項，相似而不同。接頭語，如反革命，反猶太主義，不周延，不景氣。接尾語，如理想化，科學化，一般性，必然性。</p>
<p>關於詞兒底構成，大約可分如七的九項。</p>
<p>這里，還有零零碎碎的幾點，也試着寫下來。</p>
<p>上述第四項的重疊詞，有疊成四個「字」而構成的，如男男女女，明明白白，忽怱忙忙，陸陸續續，和和氣氣，呑呑吐吐，老老小小。</p>
<p>有一種所謂「帶收釋」，如汪中「述學」「釋三九」中所述，三仕，三已，三戰，三勝，九死，九牛，九地，九天。又如四海，十方，十足，一切。</p>
<p>以上所述，只是隨手寫下來的東西；當然，是在打算將來更精細地寫一點的。</p>
<h3 id="c219">傍晚 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>在任何季節裏，我常常最愛傍晚的。人們大概都愛淸晨：當你還穿着柔軟的睡衣，帶了一副睡熊站到窗子面前，對着明朗的天空，看一片兩片薄雲懶散地飄浮過去，或看着三五成羣的小鳥翩翩地在晨風裏飛過，那眞是再安閒不過的事了。如果從睡夢中醒來，在窗帘的隙縫裏望到一塊塊蔚藍的天，聽着遠處送來的隱約的市聲，便伸手到枕邊拿起一本愛看的書看，或是無賴地哼起一雙愛聽的歌曲，這中間一定會體味到許多樂趣。然而像我們那麽載着生活的重負的，那裏會有這樣悠閒的日子呢。每一天，只是希望把日子快快打發過去，讓生活的重担負載着，把自己在生的巨輪之下榨壓着。每到傍晚時候，才給自己鬆一口氣，便懶散地坐到我的椅子裏，看着窗外給晚風吹拂的樹枝，看着掛在牆角上的夕陽，任性地吸幾口安適的空氣。一切希望的夢，也在這個時候飄浮了起來，對於生活的重負，也得到一點聊以自嘲的慰藉。</p>
<p>說到傍晚，我愛那夏天和秋天的時候。夏天的傍晚是特別美麗的，牠是那麽地使人覺得凉爽和絢麗，當你穿一件輕便的薄衣，站在樹蔭下面，或是短籬傍邊，給一陣陣晚風玩弄着短髮和衣角，那是比較坐到咖啡館裏吃刨氷要凉快多咧。而且還有那藍的天空，給夕陽渲染成的雲霞，鮮明的色澤和幻變的姿態，看着便得到一點輕柔的快感。在這種時候，無論什麽悲哀歡樂都忘了，我往往想到只有自然是最美麗吧。至於秋天的傍晚，我就最愛牠那種恬靜的色澤，以及略有悲凉的氣氛，牠是那麽地使人容易想到過去，悠然地浮起許多憧憬來。在這個時侯，我便坐在我的椅子裏，噓了一口氣，好像把一天生活上的累贅都吹去了似的，默默地望到幽澹的天空，看飛鳥成羣地在我窗前斜掠過去。</p>
<h3 id="c220">雨 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 立波</p>
<p>很多的人愛雨。「夜雨瀟湘」成了古來的名句，「雨打芭蕉」也說是能够引起淸切的離情的光景，「雨洗梨花」更能够使人想像「梨花帶雨」的悽艷，而「雨窗之下」確實也做了多少淸高的福地。</p>
<p>但我却深惡痛絕雨。雨是最沒有情熱的東西。他潮壞了光明，銷損了花枝的强健，更冷落了人間來往的路。他好像滂沱的眼淚，但這淚是毫無情義的，冷冷的沒有一絲熱意和鹹味，不是人間的。</p>
<p>晚上每被臭蟲咬醒，一聽見雨聲，就感到冷寞和嫌惡。撚開燈，馬上又閉息了；原是想起來捉掉幾個臭蟲的，因為討厭看到雨，臭蟲也不捉了。我想，臭蟲使人嫌惡，到底還知道人的熱血；又公然冒死來做人類的敵，還有生的勇敢，遭他咬，咬得睡不着，也比看着雨的顏色好。</p>
<p>雨蕭條的下，打在小窗上。想起剛才撚開燈，一瞥之下，看見白色的窗帷被屋漏滴濕了，到明天，那濕處要留下一塊黃色的痕印。又轉彎抹角的想到了十幾省的濁水上面無數浮腫的人屍。</p>
<p>雨可惡。可是他又這麽鈍感，一點也不覺到被人嫌惡了，老是不停不息的滴，滴在屋頂上，飄在窗台上，發出啾唧的無恥的聲音。</p>
<p>就是雪和氷都好；雪有潔白，氷有徹骨的寒氣，都比不冷不熱的雨好。人一淋到雨，就祇有感到無窮無盡的霉氣的。</p>
<p>「可是雨不能缺呀。雨是日常生活的必需品。」</p>
<p>正因為他是日常生活的必需品，就祇有這個功用，此外，什麽用處也沒有，更使人討厭！人不是單單銷度日常生活的。</p>
<p>如果有人問：有一頂夜光珠寳鑲造的王冠，戴着可要挨受一個月的淫雨，又有一座猛火，熊熊的活火山，山裏面有一賴燒死了的美麗的女人戴過的燒不鎔的戒指，你要那樣，戴了那雨裏的王冠呢還是去取那火中的戒指？我說，去取那女人的戒指，取得了，永遠做個死了女人的男子也罷，取不到，而且就因此燒成了飛灰也罷，都此看着不冷不熱無愛無仇的日常生活裏的灰色的雨點好。</p>
<p>我就是這樣深惡痛絕雨和愛雨的人，我以這同樣强烈的程度，熾愛着太陽和愛向太陽的男女。</p>

<p>— S.塞爾吉夫·晋斯基作蘇明譯</p>
<p>塞爾基夫·晋斯基（S.Sergeiev-Tsensky）生於一八七六年，廿八歲時開始文學生活，十年的文學活動之後，便沉默了。直到一九二三年才又出現於文壇，發表了他得長篇變形（Transfiguration）。革命時，他隱居在克里米亞，他是常常和文學界的人們隔絕的。批評家和讀者的讚賞，高爾基甚至稱他得變形爲二十世紀最偉大的俄國小說之一。他的在現今蘇俄的文壇，他並不是進步的，活躍的作家。但他的作品在革命以前就專得許多批評家和讀者的讚賞，高爾基甚至稱他的　形為二十世紀最偉大的俄國小說之一。他的作風是以語彙的豐當和詞藻的華美見長，他是一個優秀的Stytist。在主題上，他頗與安特列夫和阿茲巴雪夫相似，常以死，運命的殘酷，個人的寂寞，病態的心理狀態為主要的主題。但是在這裏譯的一篇裏，雖也同樣可以看出運命的播弄和個人寂寞的心理，但却已閃耀着另一種形態的光芒了。—附記</p>
<p>這是在一九二五年。</p>
<p>在一條流入北冰洋的西伯利亞的大河流上，是斯拍司克村。在那裏，一位年輕的新敎員，最近從維埃特卡來的，被離學校不遠的一個小屋裏的十九歲的沙瓦卡。考爾特（Coward—即怯懦者）所熱切的凝視着。</p>
<p>這位新敎員喜歡大聲的笑。大體上說，她是活潑，愉快而漂亮。她那燦爛的紅帽子和她那掛在耳邊的烏黑的捲髮十分相稱。當那此簡單的西伯利亞人在街道上問她呌什麽各字的時候，她搖着她的捲髮，同答說，『我—亞洛沙。』</p>
<p>「什麽—亞洛沙？這是個男孩子的名字，」這些農民說，仲直他們的寬闊的肩膊。</p>
<p>「這是我的名字。要是你們呌我做愛麗娜，我是不答應的，更不要說叫我伊娃諾芙娜了。</p>
<p>他們叫她做亞洛沙。</p>
<p>當沙瓦卡在街上看到她的時候，他不單是開始熱切的凝視着她，而且還熱切的凝視着自己。他做着以前從沒有做過的事情，在一面鏡子前審視自己。</p>
<p>他的臉是一副極平凡的臉。兩頰寬闊而平坦，像是被稍稍熨過一下似的。他的灰色的眼睛從眉毛底下倔强的向外探望，不管他怎樣盡力去使牠們有吸引力和愛憐，牠們看上去總是像兩隻狼在牠們的洞裏看見了一個生人一樣。</p>
<p>每天亞洛沙在從學校回來的路上走過他的小屋。一天他鼓起了勇氣去吿訴她，慢慢的動着他的嘴唇：「我是—一個木匠。我從我父親那裏學得的，他是個好木匠呢。但是我自己對於紅木也是並不怎麽外行的。」</p>
<p>『哼，你自己就像木頭，」亞洛沙大笑起來。「你要我叫你用紅木做一面穿衣鏡，或是別的什麼嗎？你是什麽意思？』</p>
<p>『這好處是在工作，不是在穿衣鏡，』沙瓦卡喃喃地說。「是在你和我。』</p>
<p>「你說什麽！在你和我！且問你是誰？你叫什麽名字？」</p>
<p>『我叫考爾特，」沙瓦卡紅了臉說，『但那並不是重要的。』</p>
<p>「考爾特？一個什麼名字！」亞洛沙搖搖她的捲髮。</p>
<p>『但那並不是重要的，』沙瓦卡頑强的回答着，隨後又極柔和的，奇妙的加說道，『我對你發生了愛情。」</p>

<h3 id="c222">花選拯災 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>目前滬上賑災游藝大會發了一通吿同胞書，說上海十里洋塲，燈紅酒綠，觀於各游藝塲之摩肩接踵，電影院之出入擁擠，可知我滬上同胞，尙非絕無能力以救災黎，因之特舉行游藝脤災大會。並謂這一「義舉」，旣可藉娛樂以遣身心，更得嘉惠災民，誠一舉而兩善皆備。</p>
<p>自然，「兩善皆備』的事情很多，尤其在上海「燈紅酒綠』下的玩意兒可謂不一而足，所以，除了游藝大會之外，還有所謂「花選賑災」的舉辦。花選的等級，有大總統副總統及國務總理參議院長衆議院長，更有貌才品性藝術六部部長與次長等。眞的，今年災民之多，為狀之慘，只要稍具惻隱之心，卽當大發慈悲，更無須說甚麼民胞物與，國祚民運。然而這一善舉却到了不得不藉「花選」以資號召，這使我們一方面旣覺賑災諸公運籌之苦心，而另一方面更感到中國人心之堪悲，與經濟疲困的可憐。</p>
<p>為甚麼？第一，近幾年來我國正遭受着經濟凋敝，農村破產，然而這是為某一部份人造成發財的機會，所以我們無法否認現在的社會情形，畸形發展得十分厲害，因此災害之來，許多人卽欲慷慨解囊也無囊可解，而所謂某一部份的人，實不能瞧到所謂哀鴻之遍野。救災的義舉，竟不能不求之於走馬章臺的風流人士，望他們於選舉花國總統等的風流事件時發發慈悲，就是這一情景的反映。</p>
<p>其次，人心奢靡，道德淪，這些現象，近來被一般「衛道」者用作「痛嫉新潮力崇古禮」的好題目。不用說娼妓之徙大遭禁止，卽男女同學同行同泳等也在各地加以取締。然而混跡花叢者也不少這些道貌岸然的人士。從救災義舉之推行於選舉花國總統這回事，就表示出所謂關心世道的人心如何，而其一痛嫉新潮力崇古禮」究竟是怎麽一回事。</p>
<h3 id="c223">雁歸草 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>陽光萎枯而無力地照在田塲上，巳經又是秋天的季候了。在遠處，對門的小山的頂上，依舊像去年的殘冬一樣，環繞地飄浮着成堆的萎黃而空虛的雲片。那些東西，正像一種沈鬱的氣分之集合一樣，凝聚在曠野而高朗得怕人的秋之高空裏，頑固而黏厚，老是不肯消散開去。這時侯，人便從以前的輕快的心情中，一天天地感到更苦悶，更陰鬱起來，由此便明白，秋天是確實毫無挽回地在走來了。</p>
<p>黃昏，在夕陽的映照中，雁子成羣從北方飛了來，預示着在後面的一個困苦的嚴冬，這些，人們是知道的，人們是經過了一個個的殘酷的冬天而過着來的，人們是熟悉牠的呀，</p>
<p>一聲聲陰沈的嗚叫，古屋的門廊也變得陰慘起來了：一個老人歇在破殘的陽光裏默默地抽烟，烟絲一縷縷地騰向空去，在靜寂中，像在思索一點永遠想不懂的東西似的。屋檐下，依然存在着三二個燕子的舊巢，而如今是，一個可怕的季侯將來臨，燕子已經遠去，而留下的這些破舊的窩巢，也顯得多凋落哪！</p>
<p>還淸楚地記得，春上，轟烈而熱鬧的季節，燕子南來的時候呢，那時節，氣候是好的，一天的靑空就保蹬了不會再有風雨，人在輕微然而却是愉快的憂鬰中，依稀還能記得晏殊的詞句：「無可柰何花落去，似會相識燕歸來。」</p>
<p>而今，歸來的再不是燕子，而是成羣的雁了。</p>
<p>原野間依然鋪着零落而無力的陽光，故鄕，想起來該也會同樣地顯得凋零，柔和，而可憐了吧？為了細小得像麵包屑一樣的生活，一年年無　期地漂流在外面（一千里的外面！）像勞碌的燕子與孤獨的雁，到夜晚來，在沈沈的烏黑的時日中，遇到的已僅僅是「似曾相識」之依稀的故土的輕夢了。</p>
<p>秋天是那麽一天天地過去，像書頁是那麼一頁頁地翻過那萎黃的書頁，而記載在這裏面的，究竟是一些什麽呢？是一些枯萎的秋陽和落葉，與一夜夜的凄絕的蟲的鳴叫吧？</p>
<p>雁羣是向着南方歸來了，經過了那麼可驚的長途跋涉，渡過了那麽悠長的曠野與巨流，為的是僅僅企圖獲得一點較溫煖的空氣啊。是的，像這樣的小動物的努力是可驚奇而感佩的，然而，那被稱作萬物之靈的人呢……？</p>
<p>飄流着，一個個地，有那麽多，而酷冷的季節是在預示着它底來臨了，然而依舊是苟安；對於故鄉，煖的故鄕，依舊是一些虛空而傷感得幾乎難以令人相信的懷念罷了。</p>
<p>說，是愚蠢而懦弱的吧。</p>
<p>曾經嘆息過燕子的離去的，而現在是，又在感念着雁子的歸來了—明日的：就在那麽一次次地嘆息中，平凡的時光終究得平凡地過去，而自己底鬢髮也會添上銀白的星星的。</p>
<p>來吧，一切枯萎的，寒冷的，儘跟着雁子毫無顧忌地來吧！自己底心上是冷漠而空洞的，可以讓它們到裏而去住。</p>
<p>是的，雁子歸來了！是南方的秋天，有成堆的雲，空曠的天河，寂寞的大海，枯萎的秋陽……總之，雁子是歸來了。</p>
<h3 id="c224">六月之夜 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>六月的夜是憂鬱的。在這狹小的茅舍里又是這般的沉靜，我心裏不禁感到一陣空虛。</p>
<p>天上的月亮皎潔地在這蒼鬱的原野上斜射着一片乳白色的銀光，把沉睡中的田原和林叢映成一幅銀色絕美的繪畫。</p>
<p>這兒雖沒有新式的時計；然而遠處傳來的更梆已經報着三更。燥熱使我煩囂地睡不着覺，便睜着眼在痴想。</p>
<p>一片凄厲的叫囂，突的不知從那兒起了。我懷着好奇心靜穆地傾聽着，可是它却又慢慢的低弱着沉靜下去。從此相差不到五分鐘我便能聽到了同一的可怕的呼號，有時是那麼地低弱，有時却又光亮起來。</p>
<p>「是夜狼的嗥嗎？或者是虎嘯！」然而我仔細地聽着，却一點也不像。</p>
<p>於是我便爬起床來，在地底下隨便找着一雙鞋穿上，用發顫的手以墻架上抓把烏槍，也不想它有沒有裝好了火藥，便踏着輕快的步伐，開着門偷偷的溜出去。</p>
<p>原野廣闊地展開了它底陰影，顯示着沉悶的寗靜。狗兒縮緊着宏碩的壯頸在樹蔭下蜷伏着。呼號沉悄了，迎面哆嗦來了田野的晚風。</p>
<p>我輕步的來回在打稻塲上踱着，心里兀的感到了焦跺和空虛。</p>
<p>突然，尖亮的呼號又來了，似乎還能够糢糊地聽到了一個近於女子嗚咽的尾聲：「苦啊！……」村狗從睡夢中驚醒了，好像突的中了一刀似的跳起，聳着鼻子，高昂着頭，宏亮的叫了，旺！旺！旺！</p>
<p>我底神經開始威到了陣震慄，額角上濕刺刺的沁滿了汗珠，毛髮好像都快</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>豎起似的，遍身感到一陣瘧疾病患的者痙孿。一個可怕的思想很快地攫住了我，使我想不顧一切地拔着腿便望屋里奔進去。但是，我畢竟沒有這樣做，我想起了自己帶着武器，便也就膽壯起來。</p>
<p>有一種不知道從什麼時候生起來的力量在蠱惑着，我於是便望發出呼號的地方逕去。</p>
<p>穿過了一畦一畦靑翠的田野，我悄悄地行進着，一顆活躍了的心為緊慄和好奇所充滿。</p>
<p>遠遠的林叢，像座蒼鬱的山巒，在銀色的天空底下，一縷縷地反射着燜顫的迴光。</p>
<p>從村里通到這林叢本來是有一條寬敝的坦途，坦途底兩旁便夾着兩條澄淸的溪流。這兩條溪流從山上發源起，一直通過三十六村的田野而流到大海里的。往常這條溪流在三十六村里的莊家，是被視為生命綫的，天氣酷熱時年靑人便會集羣結隊在這兒洗操，全身脫得光光的放肆地談笑，調情；村里的村娃也常當在上市時三三五五地借着洗滌衣服的名目，在這兒和年靑夥子們鬼混。</p>
<p>可是這幾年來到處鬧着災害，這條三十六村的生命綫便不斷地鬧着一些被逼害男女的投水，或者在溪旁的樹上上吊事情，而被視為畏途，村人認為它有鬼魅作祟，已不把它看成怎樣可愛的了。</p>
<p>我偷偷的走着，忽然在溪旁的一叢樹蔭下，我發現了一團糢糊的陰影在那兒蠕動着。仔細一看！隱隱的便能够認出了他們一共是三個人，好像是兩個男人和一個女人。這兩個男人都是一種農民的打扮，死拖活捉的夾着一個頭髮篷鬆，衣服破碎的女人望林中進去，那個女人便死命地抱住一株樹根不肯進去，口里鳴咽着。</p>
<p>我心里暗自默忖道：「這一定是奸情或者是無端的逼害！」禁不住憤怒起來，提緊了槍想大聲的吆喝，但是當我想起自己帶出來的鳥槍原沒裝好了火藥，心里不禁忙亂起來了，不知道自己該怎樣纔好：追上去呢！還是回了村里去叫人再來呢？一時迷亂着，無從决定。但是當我定了一會神後，再看看這溪邊上正在扮演着悲劇的那三個角色，巳經不知從什麼時候便跑得無踪無跡了。</p>
<p>我心里感到一陣悶鬱也就回村了。</p>
<p>第二天早上有人上山去砍柴木，便在溪流里發現了一個被勒斃的女屍，但是却誰也不知她叫什麼名字，那個地方的人。</p>
<p>這事過後不到兩個月，村里便來了一個將約有五六十歲年紀，鬚髮斑白的老人。他穿着身襤褸的衣服，頭戴竹箬，背駄包袱，手里高揚一把白紙旗，旗上歪寫着兩個大字：「尋人」，敲一面破鑼，用着悽苦的聲調喊道：「好心好量的善人，誰人看見我底芸兒……」話沒說完便嗚咽住了。</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>近來黃葉嶺山坡上已聽不到那雄壯的「礦夫之歌』，而祇聽到那一串一串的太息聲，和咒詛聲了。原因是兩個月沒有發工資了。</p>
<p>別的不打緊，倒苦了那班流汗流血的礦工，他們全是做一天工，有一天飯吃的，怎樣能够給他們把工資一連欠了幾個月不發呢？於是他們的生活就發生了恐慌——</p>
<p>「他媽的，三個月不發工錢，叫咱們拿煤屑當飯吃嗎」？阿狗憤憤地，從盤桶上歇了下來，扭起破衣角抹了一把汗說。銀寳對他同情地瞥了一下，嘆了一口氣，也從盤桶傍邊走到棚外的一棵一筒一筒的吸進去，但是他空着的肚子遂是空着的。</p>
<p>「眞的，什麼幾時上海可以匯欵下來，幾時可以發工錢，那些全是騙鬼的話』！金龍忍不住也揷進嘴來咆哮的說：「老二，咱們去找賬房去，叫他們把工錢算給了咱們，咱們不要做工了；反正做也餓肚子，不做也是餓肚子，老子情願餓死在老家里去的……』</p>
<p>話不是這樣講得，你暴躁有什麽用？得，不做，不做咱們又得到那兒去呢？到處都還不是一樣！你不看見人家廠里全在裁工人，减工資，失業同志一天一天的在那里多起來，人家要想找個做白工的地方都沒有呢？咱們現在需要生存，所以還得忍耐住性兒來幹，沒有辦法，總之只怪自己為什麼要生在這樣一個世界里來！」老二說到這里，聲音已經有些顫抖了，但是眼睛里幾乎暴漲出血來，然而終於換了一個氣向他安慰着：「他們雖然欠了咱們幾個月工錢，可是早晚總是要算還咱們的一。</p>
<p>老二雖則這樣的安慰着他們，其實他自己心里何嘗不在憤恨；可是有些朴麼法子想。幾次的向賬房去算工錢，他總是回答總經理沒有回來，或者說上海匯來的欵子卽日要到了。但是左等右等，等到一筆欵子匯來的時候，他們自家先派好了，還捱得到工人的份！</p>
<p>大家沉默着不說一句話，週遭全給悲悽的空氣充塞着。一大堆五十多個人全擠在一個不十分大的蘆蓆棚下，大堆大堆的煤屑，彷彿一個一個小土山般的在曠塲傍邊蹲着，在冒着一股一股氛氣。</p>
<p>槓工們却一蔀又一蔀的將媒送到煤棧里去——</p>
<p>「他們是大老板，咱們是工人，工人是做一天吃一天的，一家老小也要生活，他儘一月兩月的不把工錢發出來，這算什麽呢」？</p>
<p>『咱不相信他們搗的究竟不知是什麽鬼，工錢也發不出來，還要開什麽勞什子的煤礦呢」！</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>噹—噹—噹—噹—噹—噹—</p>
<p>礦穴上面的鐵板響了，於是他們這一羣便一擁上了盤桶，掄住了槓子轉，轉；將一隻一隻的空桶放下去，吊起一桶一桶的渾水來。</p>
<p>「㗒……在礦穴底里漾出了這樣一聲悠長的呼喊，那音波是十分飄遠而糢糊的。</p>
<p>「噢……」上面是那麽地還了一聲下去。</p>
<p>「一丈七尺料段——」下面又爬起了這樣一句，於是一支一丈七尺的毛松樹從桶上褂了下去。在離地面十五六丈深就是礦穴，那穴的空間約莫有四五丈開閻，二十多個礦工全在里面工作；有五六個木匠工，他們是專管理夾板，搭蹺和打樁的。半腰架着板跳，人都在板上往來作事，底下全是水。里面沒有空氣，沒有亮光，地氣和一種水土的潮濕味窒息的得人的腦子也幾乎暴開來，但是他們要生活，不能不强制的忍耐，雖然同伴中每天總有一兩人病倒了抬回去，然而也抵當作沒有看見一般！</p>
<p>因為經濟少，範圍小，所以許多地方全採用了土法，沒有辦完全機械，因此非特要多費不多人工和精力，並且出煤也十二分的遲滯。</p>
<p>『喞—喞—喞—」散工鐘響了，於是他們有的從盤桶上放了下來，也有的從礦穴里吊了起來，拍去了身上的煤屑，拖着一個給饑餓和勞苦的肢體走出了礦屋的門，但是誰的面孔都是憂鬱的，不會有一絲懽愉的色彩，大家只低垂了頭，默默地向着回家的途上走去；人，像是從牢監里赦放出的一羣囚徒，他們彷彿自家商議着明天能否得到大家勞苦的代價。</p>

<p>— （明天）</p>
<p>五，黃耐霜這個名字很熱習，這倒不是因為她與淪落異域的沒有靈瑰的女兒黃柳霜有着直似的名宇。遠在四年前吧，那時候中國電影界發現了一個奇蹟，第一部有聲影片「雨過天靑」很新奇的出現了，其實奇蹟倒並不是這部有聲影片，而是這部有聲影片中的女主角黃耐霜女士的芳姿，確實的，那窈窕的身軀那富於愛嬌的臉兒，不知有多少影迷為她顚倒，可惜此後她跑到另一方面去演人生更眞切的戲劇去了，不得不與她熱誠的觀衆暫時吿一聲小別，直到現在她好似一顆久巳隱藏在雲後的星兒又光輝地出現於王先生的影片中，我們相信王先生影片得到廣大羣衆的歡迎，我們這位美麗小為兒不無力量吧！</p>
<p>六，新時代公司有兩個「偉人」：一翻胖而矮的王師母，一個就是瘦而長的陳太太。陳木太姓翟名綺綺，她有溫柔的性情，文雅的談吐，和廣博的人生經騐，她很可以做一個政治家，或者是家庭中的賢妻良母，但是她對那些都感不到興趣，她毅然决然投身到電影界，她常說藝術是創造光明社會的武器，她將用藝術的武器去與眼前的黑暗勢力搏鬥，這種精神是很可佩服的，我們謹祝翟女士搏鬥勝利。</p>
<p>七，大家還記得不，不久以前，有一個世界最胖的女人來上海表演，一時滿足了上海人的新奇慾，其實這並不算希奇，假若大家注意到葉淺予的漫畫王先生中的王師母的胖姿的話，那位世界最胖的女人就不會那樣値得人們稱奇了。固然這是漫畫，隨人可以畫得如何胖都可以的，可是奇怪的事情就跟着來了，當新時代影片公司成立的時候了，要物色一個與漫畫中的王師母一樣胖的女角，誰也以為這是不可能的事，可是登報徵求的第二天，公司裏忽然來了一位奇特的生客，這客人就是後來的王先生影片中的王師母桑淑貞女士。她的胖姿不用我介紹，諸位一定早巳在銀幕上見過了，她不但身份給合劇中人的需要，而且表演也是很好，此次到蘇州去拍外景，把她的那兩隻大而肥的臂膀晒得像一雙帶紫紅色的金華火腿，王先生在戲中正在哭着大天早沒有飯吃的時候，左明指着王師母的一雙大肥臂膀說：『這兒有兩隻大火腿為什麼不煮來吃呢？」說畢，大家都忍不住笑了。</p>

Regarding the details of the investigation, Miller stated that he must report to the embassy before he could make any announcements.  The British Embassy has not made an official statement regarding the incident.  British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen is still on vacation at the beach.  The British government has not yet sent a reply to Beiping.  Rumors that the British Ambassador telegraphed our Ministry of Foreign Affairs with demands are not accurate.  The Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stationed in Beiping previously received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordering them to negotiate nearby.  Yesterday, Secretary Cheng was dispatched to formally offer condolences.  Commissioner Cheng Xigeng is currently present and will be within the week.</p>

At the same time, a telegram was sent to the government of Chahar Province asking them to take good care of Jones's coffin as it passed through the province.  It is heard that the British Embassy has reported the matter to Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen and requested instructions from London. However, as of noon on the 21st, they had not yet received a reply and therefore had no opinion to express.

<h3 id="e25">Lessons from the Murder of Jones <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>—Du</p>
<p>British journalist Jones, with his robust and capable hands and feet, fulfilled his responsibility of extensively researching and gathering information. He did not fear hardship and personally braved dangers. His vigorous and forward-looking spirit should be admired by all of us. Unfortunately, he fell into a bandit's den and suddenly lost his freedom. Although our country's authorities exerted great efforts to rescue him, and conditions for ransom were negotiated back and forth, it ultimately did not help secure Jones's life, resulting in the tragic outcome of his murder near Baochang. When the bad news arrived, we, standing as members of the same profession, could not overcome our grief. Considering the matter from the perspective of the host country, we felt infinite remorse for the creation of this perverse incident.</p>
<p>Jones and German journalist Mueller were kidnapped by bandits on their way from Duolun to Zhangjiakou on the 29th of last month. The situation at the time was vague and unclear, and the rumors were not detailed. It was not until Mueller was released from the bandit's den that we learned that the bandit's purpose was solely to kidnap for ransom. Our country's authorities, from the central government down to the magistrate of Baochang County, exhausted their wisdom and spared no effort to plan a rescue. They did not hesitate to compromise and engage in equal negotiations with the bandits, putting down their weapons and engaging in peaceful contact. However, the bandit's demands were excessive, their location was uncertain, and the situation was complex. Until the official was hesitant to maintain the true circumstances. While the authorities were hesitating and planning, news suddenly came that Jones had been murdered. How this change occurred is difficult to understand. In any case, the measures taken by our country's authorities to rescue this foreign colleague cannot be said to have not been the best efforts. Their past painstaking efforts should be seen by China and foreign countries alike. Since things have reached the point of no return, words only increase lamentation. If the dead had knowledge, they would be able to deeply understand our sincerity and offer understanding.</p>
<p>Since the area east of Chahar formed a special situation, all measures have been subject to constraints. The authorities lost their ability to control, and bandits took advantage of the opportunity to become active. The situation was dire, and banditry was a daily occurrence. Jones and Mueller arrived in Zhangjiakou on July 11th and requested to travel to Inner Mongolia. Local officials immediately informed them that bandits were rampant and advised them not to go. However, the two were determined and willingly signed a statement stating that they would risk the journey. This ultimately aroused the covetousness of the bandits, leading to an unfortunate situation. The bandits clearly knew that they were hiding in a place where the military's influence did not directly reach, and that foreigners were a valuable commodity that officials were unwilling to abandon. If it was possible to profit from it, they would take it. Therefore, once they were in their grasp, they would not let go. And foreigners traveling there further increased their danger. It is a pity that Jones was ignorant of the details and relied on his adventurous spirit to obtain this unexpected tragedy. Based on the above, we can derive two lessons from the murder of Jones. First, the so-called special situation not only hinders administrative facilities, but also endangers traffic safety, giving bandits the opportunity to grow and making it impossible for Chinese and foreign travelers to be guaranteed safety. Unless we quickly seek to restore control, we will not be able to see the light of day again. Second, foreigners traveling in the interior should absolutely follow the instructions of Chinese authorities in the future and not rely on their own temporary bloodthirst. It must be known that the dangers are difficult to identify suddenly. One wrong step can ruin the whole game. The consequences can be endless. After this incident, learning from the past, I know that foreigners who set foot on this land will have a deep understanding.</p>

<p>(London) The Abyssinian situation is becoming increasingly critical. The entire country is now discussing this. The Foreign Office was very active today. Labour Party leader Lansbury and Liberal Party leader George both went to the Foreign Office this morning. Lansbury arrived at 10:30 and met with Foreign Secretary Hoare for 20 minutes. George traveled by car from Chequers specifically for the meeting and arrived at the ministry at 11:00, where he met with the Foreign Secretary and Eden for about an hour. Afterwards, someone inquired about the news from George, but he declined to comment. Shortly thereafter, the Foreign Secretary held a preliminary Imperial Conference in the ministry. The High Commissioners of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada in Britain, as well as the British Ambassador to Egypt, attended. It is heard that the cabinet's foreign affairs committee will meet today at the Prime Minister's residence in Downing Street. Because Prime Minister Baldwin has not yet returned to the capital, the Lord Privy Seal MacDonald will preside over the meeting. The committee will listen to Eden's report on the Paris Tripartite Conference and consider the situation arising from the failure of the conference. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) The representative of the Irish Free State also attended the preliminary Imperial Conference held by Foreign Secretary Hoare in the ministry today. Later, American Chargé d'Affaires Atherton spoke with the Foreign Secretary for about 45 minutes. It is heard that Samuel, the leader of the Samuelite faction of the Liberal Party, had a long talk with Hoare and Eden yesterday. Today, responsible sources claimed that the British government's policy is to give diplomatic negotiations every opportunity. Britain and Italy have not engaged in diplomatic negotiations as expected by the Paris communiqué of August 18. No one has yet submitted a responsible proposal to London. The League of Nations Executive Council meeting will be held on September 4th. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

(Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources, the British cabinet will discuss the practical aspects of the Abyssinian issue at its regular meeting on Wednesday. The British cabinet will view the Abyssinian issue as a conflict between the Italian government and the League of Nations and will study the consequences of the conflict item by item. Britain believes that the most pressing issue at present is the protection of the British Embassy in Abyssinia. Britain will send additional troops to protect the embassy in the Abyssinian capital, and the British colonies bordering Abyssinia will also increase their defenses. This matter will be studied in conjunction with the authorities of the British colonies. It is expected that the colonial authorities' report will be sent soon. In addition to this issue, the cabinet will consider amending the method of exporting military supplies to Abyssinia, as British public opinion generally believes that the failure of the Paris Tripartite Talks was the fault of Italy, and therefore advocates lifting the arms embargo on Abyssinia. However, after these two measures are decided, the core of the problem remains. There are two main points to the core of this issue: one is the sanctions to be taken when Italy carries out aggression, and the other is how the British-Italian relationship will change regardless of the League of Nations' decision. According to a statement made to the press by Italian representative Aloisi before leaving Paris to return home yesterday, it can be seen from this statement that Italy does not believe that the British water rights and interests on the upper reaches of the Blue Nile must be respected. Therefore, the British are deeply afraid that Italy may one day infringe upon the water rights of British Egypt and Sudan. If so, the Blue Nile must be diverted and the source of Lake Tana cut off before this can happen. The project is extremely large and requires a huge amount of capital, which Italy cannot afford. However, it is possible for Italy to adopt a smaller-scale project plan to damage the irrigation of Sudan's cotton fields, which is why Britain cannot help but worry about it. Secondly, the race issue is also a serious concern for the British cabinet. The Italian-Abyssinian war is enough to cause a conflict between white and colored races. Not only will Africa be disturbed by this, but also disputes will inevitably occur in the rest of Britain's territories, and even the organization of the British Empire may be endangered. Generally, it is believed that the British overseas autonomous territories, in view of the seriousness of the race issue, all advocate taking a tough stance in Geneva, especially the South African Federation. The South African Federation's government firmly believes that the Suez Canal should be blockaded in the event of an Italian-Abyssinian war, and that the League of Nations should support the resolution on the Italian-Abyssinian incident with effective means of valley species. The British autonomous territories have always regarded the League of Nations as a guarantee of their political independence and complete sovereignty, while the British government believes that the only way to intervene in European affairs and avoid the notoriety of alliance diplomacy is through the League of Nations. Although the two have different views, they agree on taking a firm stance in the League of Nations. However, the greatest difficulty in taking a firm stance in Geneva is France's stance. Because France maintains a policy of alliance with Italy in Central Europe, if France is to take a firm stance in Geneva and harm its friendship with Italy, Britain must provide France with compensation so that France can have nothing to fear in the event of something happening in Central Europe. This level will also be considered by the British cabinet. In short, whether Britain should go all out and take firm action in the League of Nations is a question that should be resolved by the cabinet meeting on the third day. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) International circles are all talking about the possibility of sanctions against Italy. They hope that tomorrow's British cabinet meeting will advocate holding an emergency meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council within the next week, without waiting until September 4th. Generally, it is believed that this move will save a week's time, which is extremely valuable, because there is a possibility of war at any time. According to the resolutions of the League of Nations General Assembly in 1921 and 1927, the League of Nations' sanctions plans include adopting a blockade and naval demonstrations against countries that endanger peace. The danger of resorting to high pressure is generally recognized. It is believed that the most effective way to stop Italy from annexing Abyssinia is to blockade the Suez Canal, that is, to prevent Italian ships from passing through the canal. However, the League of Nations Executive Council must first vote to authorize the countries with the necessary naval power, such as Britain and France, to implement the blockade. In terms of naval power alone, implementing the blockade is within Britain's power, but the British government certainly does not want to take any unilateral action. League of Nations personnel are now returning to Geneva in droves, knowing that the next half month will be a critical period for the survival of the League of Nations and the war and peace in East Africa and other places. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, the French newspapers believe that a peaceful resolution is hopeless and painfully speak of the need to maintain the Stresa Front to prevent German danger.

<p>(London) Abyssinia and silver are currently the two major events of great interest to Londoners. If a conflict occurs between Italy and Abyssinia, it will inevitably cause various complex problems. The sanctions of the League of Nations and the definition of contraband are particularly contentious issues. World commerce will definitely be affected, which is what the business community is worried about. Silver continues to destabilize foreign exchange. The United States purchased a large amount of silver on August 19 and 20, but there were no similar transactions in the foreign exchange market. It is said that the US Treasury Department deals directly with large commercial banks because these banks purchase US dollars every autumn. However, others say that the Bank of England advances pounds and uses gold allocated to New York as collateral. There is currently a rumor that the United States is buying silver at its current value without any restrictions. Whether this statement is true or not cannot be verified. At the same time, the price of gold is currently below 140 shillings, the first time this year. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>

<p>(Washington) Moffett, Director of the US Low-Cost Housing Loan Committee, is an accomplished industrialist with authority on Chinese affairs. Commissioned by President Roosevelt, he traveled to China during his vacation this year to unofficially investigate the impact of the US silver purchase policy on China and to take the opportunity to investigate the situation of the silver issue. Moffett arrived here from the Far East and issued a statement saying that the US silver purchase policy does not harm China, and that the current situation in China is better than most people believe. He also said that in order to prevent drastic fluctuations in silver prices, it may be necessary to stabilize them. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Moffett, director of the Federal Housing Administration, who recently traveled around the world, said after meeting with President Roosevelt today that raising and stabilizing silver prices could benefit most countries in the world. Even for China as a whole, it is not as greatly harmed as generally imagined. Currently, China has largely made progress compared to last year, and there is no shortage of prosperity. The so-called US government's silver policy greatly harms China is actually international propaganda. The various difficulties of the Shanghai business community recently may still be due to the excessively low price of silver. Ying believes that the current sluggishness in the Shanghai market is the result of excessively high land prices in recent years. As for after the rise in silver prices, other prices will be affected. If China wants to buy American cotton, of course, a silver price of 67.5 cents can buy a lot more than 25 cents. However, drastic changes in prices must be properly prevented, as this could create opportunities for speculators. Moffett also said that a news agency had mistakenly reported that he believed that the current market decline in China was caused by the US government's silver policy. He also does not believe that China will benefit after linking with the pound, because new banknotes will be issued at that time, and most of the transactions in the interior still do not use gold and silver, but use copper as a medium. Moffett believes that the higher the silver price, the easier it is to stabilize. If the president is willing, he can also formally write a report on the relationship between China and the US silver policy. It is reported that Moffett spent a long time in Shanghai studying business conditions during his travels around the world. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e80">Japanese Side Drafts Yet Another Economic Cooperation Plan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Economic Investigation Group in Peiping Formulates a So-Called Cooperation Plan Which Has Already Arrived in Peiping</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Japan is now drafting a new plan for the development of North China's economy. Experts from the South Manchuria Railway Company, representatives from the Japanese military, and representatives from the puppet regime's business community are establishing a "North China Economic Investigation Group" in Beiping. The group is organized into five sections: (1) Railways, (2) Highways, (3) Mining, (4) Port Construction, and (5) Commerce. Nonaka, the director of the 6th section of the Economic Investigation Committee who came to Beiping the other day, has already returned to Dalian to report. After a concrete plan has been drafted, Nonaka will come to Beiping again to organize the "North China Economic Investigation Group". Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, Foreign Minister Hirota repeatedly proposed it to Chiang Tso-pin, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, before Chiang returned to China. The Japanese side has already sent the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation plan to Beiping, the contents of which are as follows:</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must fundamentally improve China's national economy. The main points are as follows: (1) In agriculture, accept Japanese technical guidance, with the goal of increasing the utility value of agricultural products for Japanese industry. (2) Develop mining, with cooperation in both capital and technology. (3) Technological and capital cooperation in the development of transportation. (4) Cooperation in the textile industry and other industries. (5) Establish a Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement Association to promote civilian interaction. (6) Revise Chinese tariffs to restore the Sino-Japanese Agreed Tariff Rates.</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>Agriculture is the foundation of China's national economy, with an annual production value of about 1.5 billion yuan. Japanese technical assistance could increase income and help alleviate China's international balance of payments imbalances. (1) Encourage cotton planting and provide technical assistance to make China one of the world's three major cotton producing countries. Japan imports about 200 million yuan worth of cotton annually. However, knowledge of cotton planting is rudimentary and requires Japanese technical assistance to improve quality, so that Chinese rural villages and the Japanese textile industry can achieve a policy of co-existence and co-prosperity. (A) China's encouragement of cotton planting and the possibility of Chinese cotton exports: China's cotton production has recently been about 10 million dan annually, with a consumption of 9 million dan. Due to quality reasons, it still needs to import 2 million dan from foreign countries annually. Currently, the National Government is expanding cotton growing areas to 60 million mu (currently 40 million mu) based on the cotton encouragement plan. This would allow for a harvest of 14 million dan, meeting the consumption of 10 million dan, with a surplus of 4 million dan. However, based on the quality of current products, foreign cotton may still need to be imported for two or three years. If China raises cotton import taxes or cancels export taxes, then Chinese cotton exports will not be difficult. (B) The Japanese side's facilities for improving cotton: Japanese textile operators in China have already achieved considerable success in lending excellent cotton seeds and improving cotton quality in Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and other provinces. Recently, a certain party has completed a survey for planting cotton along the Beining Railway Line and is implementing part of it. (C) A cotton planting salvation movement: In North China, a unique policy of national industrialization is being pursued. Due to the low profits from planting wheat and soybeans, there is a shift to planting profitable cotton, the so-called "cotton planting salvation movement". (2) Planting wheat: China is the world's second largest wheat producer, but imports 10 million yuan of wheat annually. Japan needs to import 70 million yuan from Canada, the United States, and Australia every year. Japan is recognized worldwide for its superior wheat cultivation and can provide technical guidance to China. (3) Wool: Recently, Japan's domestic wool weaving industry has developed, and the demand for wool has increased sharply. Japan needs 1.8 million dan every year, mostly from foreign countries. China's wool production has not been accurately counted, but it was roughly 250,000 tons last year, mostly exported to the United States. Japan only imported 12,000 dan. In the future, China and Japan should work together to increase China's wool production. (4) Other technical guidance: Improving agricultural fields and training rural instructors is necessary. The ten counties of Luan Dong in China have always relied on Japan. Through the introduction of a certain party, instructors have been dispatched to intern at the South Manchuria Railway Agricultural Experiment Station. In addition, the Japanese side provides guidance on water irrigation projects. Research on the industrial utilization of agricultural raw materials such as cotton and wheat, besides the raw materials needed by Japan, such as vegetable oil and pig bristles, can provide raw materials for industrial countries. "Implementing a group economy" means that neighboring countries have a prior obligation to supply.</p>
<p>Mining</p>
<p>(1) Iron: Daye and Elephant Trunk Mountain in Hubei, Taozhong in Anhui, and Jinlingzhen in Shandong already have relations with Japan. In addition, Japanese technical cooperation and capital cooperation are necessary for iron ore in provinces such as Chahar, Henan, and Fujian. (2) Antimony and Tungsten: Refining is necessary for antimony in Hunan and tungsten in Guangxi, and Japan must provide guidance. (3) Oil: Japan can provide lessons for oil field surveys in Shaanxi. (4) Coal: Coal is most suitable for Sino-Japanese barter trade. Japan should provide capital and technical assistance to Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>China's railways are underdeveloped, making it very difficult to transport products from the interior to ports. Shanxi's coal and Henan's cotton would be much more active if there were railways directly to the seaports. Japan has plans to extend the Jiaoji Railway and build the Cangshi Railway for transportation.</p>
<p>Textile</p>
<p>It is well known that China's textile industry is depressed, and therefore, it needs Japan's rescue. Recently, there has been a trend of high-end products being transported to Japanese textile factories. This is not necessarily detrimental to Japan. The key is how the parties cooperate.</p>
<p>In order to promote close Sino-Japanese economic relations, and especially to promote civilian, spiritual, technical, and capital approaches to Sino-Japanese trade, a "Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement Association" should be organized, following the example of the Japanese-American and British-Japanese trade agreement associations. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese tax rates set in May of the 8th year of Showa (1933) expired, and Japanese cotton textiles, seafood, wheat, etc. lost preferential treatment. China's cotton, embroidery, and silk fabrics also lost special rights. The tax rate on Japanese goods was raised by 20% to 80%, or even as high as 150% to 600%. No matter how one explains it, the result is strongly anti-Japanese. Japan is urging China to wake up. As a result, last July, the Japanese side requested a revision of the tax rates. The tax rate on seafood was lowered, and the tax rate on cotton textiles was reduced very little. The Japanese side was ultimately dissatisfied. Recently, China again increased all import taxes, but exempted export taxes and transit taxes. If Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is implemented, improvements should be made. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Bandit Atmosphere Rampant in Luan Dong <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Large and Small Bands of Bandits Are Everywhere; Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan Are Up to No Good</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Recently, the bandit atmosphere near the Great Wall Line has become rampant. Villages and towns in the northern borders of Zunhua, Qian'an, Miyun, and Xinglong counties are particularly areas where bandits roam. Due to the growing green crops, the bandits' tracks are elusive and uncertain, making it difficult for the security teams to encircle and suppress them. Recently, a band of over 700 bandits led by Ma Huwu from Dongjia Flavor occupied the area and planned to infiltrate from inside Malan Pass, harassing Zunhua and Jixian counties. The bandit gangs were organized like the military, calling themselves the pseudo-North China Autonomous National Salvation Army, and were organized into 37 detachments. However, the Japanese and puppet troops in Malanyu were heavily guarded. The bandit gangs only stayed in Dongjiakou and did not actually disturb the interior. In Zunhua, Lulong, and Qian'an, the people are panicking. The county towns have conscripted large groups of militia to defend the city, closing the city gates tightly during the day and inspecting suspicious individuals. County Magistrate Li of Xinglong specifically went to Tangshan on the 17th to meet with Yin Rugeng and pleaded for the security team to be dispatched to suppress the bandits. On the 16th, about 500 bandits from the pseudo-North China Army led by Li Laobao were discovered near the Great Wall Line at Tiemenguan and Fouerling near Shanhai Shimensai. The Zhang Yantian Division of the Second Security Corps rushed to encircle and suppress them. The bandits relied on the mountain's dangers to resist, and after a fierce battle lasting one day and night, the bandits were finally unable to hold out and fled to the vicinity of Xifengkou on the morning of the 17th. The area has been placed under special alert. However, there are many lurking bandit gangs east of the Shi River and around Shanhaiguan, all hidden in the green crops, and they are active at night, causing unrest around Yuguan. Gunfire occurs from time to time at night, and residents cannot sleep peacefully. The police of the Shanhaiguan Special Public Security Bureau and the police of Linyu County can only maintain the city gates and are unable to go out of the city to search and suppress the bandits. Therefore, the area three or four li away from the city is within the bandits' sphere of influence. In Xituogu Village, west of Beimaguan in Miyun, there is a traitorous civilian named Peng Ziyun, who is nearly sixty years old. Recently, he has been very active, gathering more than 500 bandits, organizing a pseudo-army, issuing blue cloth military uniforms to each person, and wearing yellow armbands, calling themselves the North China Army. He intends to contact the bandit gangs at various passes along the Great Wall and carry out a major operation. The county magistrate of Miyun has reported to the Jiji District Administrative Commissioner's Office and requested that the security team be sent to suppress the bandits, so as to prevent the bandit forces from spreading. In addition, a gang of about 200 mounted bandits, armed with well-equipped firearms, recently appeared near Shixia, Miyun. They came from Yanqing in eastern Chahar. On the 16th, they fought fiercely with the security team in Xiahe Village for one night. The bandits abandoned more than a dozen corpses and fled to Xiachengzi. Before leaving, they kidnapped more than a dozen men and women. There is also a bandit gang entrenched on Zhongfeng Mountain in western Miyun, with a population of about 600 to 700. All the villages in the vicinity have been looted, and they intend to invade the county seat. Wang Boling, the county magistrate of Miyun, specifically invited all the gentry of the county on the 17th to discuss the city defense methods and decided to conscript strong men from various villages to organize temporary militias and assist in the defense separately. The above is only the largest and most disruptive bandit gangs. Robberies, arson, and killings by sporadic small gangs in other counties are everywhere. Yin Rugeng has scheduled a visit to various counties in late August to provide instructions on joint defense methods. It has been found that the rampant bandits in the war zone are instigated by Liu Guitang and Shi Yousan, creating chaos and doing evil in the process. Therefore, suppression is not as simple as dealing with the bandits themselves. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Beiping's Treacherous Merchants Smuggling Silver Repeatedly <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Inside Story of Fresh-Faced People Transporting Silver Out of the Pass; Several Treacherous Merchant Organizations Uncovered</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the occurrence of the silver dollar problem in Beiping, the amount of silver dollars flowing out has not affected the cash reserves of the various banks. However, it is feared that the silver dollars transferred to Beiping from other ports in the past six months have all been secretly transported out of the country by a group of treacherous merchants. Looking at the daily Ping-Shen through train between Ping and Yu, there are about fifty or sixty fresh-faced passengers, or even more than one hundred, carrying a suitcase each. Counting on the basis of each person carrying 400 yuan of silver, the amount of silver flowing out in the past six months can be seen.</p>
<p>The Beiping authorities have considered the method of preventing the outflow of silver dollars again and again. In addition to writing to the Japanese side requesting them to assist in cracking down on fresh-faced people who privately transport silver dollars, they are also paying attention to the collusion of treacherous merchants. Over the past few months, these treacherous merchants have had three burrows for cunning rabbits and used very sophisticated tactics, so their secret organizations have not been uncovered. According to inquiries from various sources, the batches of fresh-faced people who constantly travel back and forth smuggling silver are entirely hired by treacherous merchants. Generally, the profit earned for every 100 yuan is split in half, 4-6, or 3-7, depending on the market price. The profits earned by these treacherous merchants in the past six months are almost uncountable.</p>
<p>The Police Department of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping has repeatedly detained fresh-faced people carrying silver dollars at the East Railway Station and Xizhimen Railway Station. Although the number has not been counted, it is believed that it is definitely not small. On the surface, it is a loss to the fresh-faced people, but in reality, it is purely a sacrifice by a group of treacherous merchants. Therefore, no matter how much is intercepted, it is of no interest to the smuggling fresh-faced people. Although the Japanese have been very generous in their handling of the intercepted silver dollars, distributing them to various banks with paper currency issuance, the amount is only a drop in the bucket. However, this may alert the treacherous merchants that employing fresh-faced people is not reliable.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ping-Shen train encountered bandits near the Shi River, and all the paper money received by the fresh-faced people outside the pass was robbed, which must have dealt a not insignificant blow to the treacherous merchants. According to transportation industry news, in the past week, the number of fresh-faced passengers on the various trains between Ping and Yu has suddenly decreased, and it is believed that the number of fresh-faced passengers carrying silver dollars has also sharply decreased. According to financial industry news, in the past week, there has been no significant change in the silver dollars in Beiping. The amount of silver deposits has been slightly increasing every day. This proves that there has been no outflow recently. One of the reasons why silver deposits can be stabilized is that the private transportation by fresh-faced people has decreased. However, the recent breaking of smuggling organizations in Ping has an important relationship.</p>
<p>The situation of the Ping Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team breaking private silver dollar organizations in recent days is briefly recorded as follows: (1) On August 16, the first detective team discovered in Tiande Zuo cigarette shop on Meishi Street outside Qianmen that the shop manager, Mu Ziyuan, secretly purchased silver dollars and transported them out of the country to make profits. Mu Ziyuan and the shop assistant, Wan Ruiqing, were arrested. According to their confessions, Liu Ziming, the main culprit, was arrested at No. 19 Caijia Hutong, and more than 1,000 silver dollars and multiple silver-transporting vests were found. Liu confessed that he had been operating this illegal incident for two months, transporting out 2,000 to 3,000 yuan every day. (2) On the 17th, plainclothes police arrested Zhang Yupei, the shopkeeper of Wang Chengxiang cigarette shop at No. 90 North Road, Tianqiao, and Guo Zongwen, the shopkeeper of Guo Ji cigarette shop, and several bags of silver dollars. In addition, Rao Yingge, a resident of No. 40 Sunjia Pit, Longfusi, Dongcheng, was discovered by Li Tonghui, a policeman in the Third District, selling silver dollars, and was arrested on the evening of the 17th and confessed without denial. (3) On the 18th, when the Yiji Money Shop in the Meat Market was engaged in private silver dollar smuggling, the detective team of the first detective team went to search and seized Liu Baotian, Ma De, Li Yu, Li Jinbo, He Yongxian, Liu Shaoming, and other criminals involved in buying and selling silver dollars. More than 500 silver dollars were found on each person. (4) According to news released by the detective organization, in addition to breaking the above-mentioned private transportation organizations in recent days, He Xing and Xin Maosheng cigarette shops, and Yisheng and Ding Taichang grain shops were also discovered to be smuggling silver dollars. They were searched one after another, and many people were arrested. The total amount of silver dollars found was over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The authorities attach great importance to the handling of the key criminals involved in smuggling silver dollars that have been broken up in recent days and have decided to punish them in accordance with the Central Government's specially promulgated orders and the laws of the Republic of China for endangering the country. Therefore, those with serious circumstances will be sentenced to death to warn against illegal practices. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Anhui Province Intensifies Flood Prevention; Survey and Repair the Sui River to Unblock the River <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: After the Yellow River breached in Shandong Province and the main flow invaded south, the Anhui Provincial Government ordered Lu Peizhang and Nan Yuejun, the commissioners of the sixth and seventh districts of northern Anhui, to summon the county magistrates to hold a meeting to discuss measures to defend against the Yellow River water and ordered the relevant dikes to be repaired completely to prevent emergencies. It also sent personnel to inspect and supervise. Now, the provincial government has received successive reports from the relevant county governments and Cui Bingsen, the commissioner sent, that the Yellow River flood has passed Shaanxi Province, and the water situation in Weishan Lake in Jiangsu Province increased by an average of about two inches from the 1st to the 6th of this month. After the 6th, it gradually eased, but on the 10th, the area around the lake increased by more than two inches, and the situation gradually became serious. The provincial government is deeply concerned that the Yellow River breach in Henan Province will cause the main flow to turn sharply downward, and it has telegraphed the Suxian County Government to inform the relevant counties to strictly prevent it in accordance with successive telegrams. It also ordered the situation of the defense of the various counties in northern Jiangsu after the Yellow River entered the Central Canal to be reported for investigation. In addition, the provincial government believes that the various rivers in northern Anhui, which are close to Jiangsu and Henan, have been repaired well in recent years, and the river dikes are also very strong, but the Sui River still needs to be repaired urgently. The river was previously surveyed and completed by a joint measurement team composed of the provincial governments of this province and Jiangsu Province and the Huai River Guidance Committee. The provincial government also intends to send personnel to survey and handle it immediately and supervise Suxian to convene an emergency meeting to repair the river dikes in order to ensure that the river dikes are strong and the river is unblocked to prevent floods.

<p>The robbery and assault on the Shenhu ferry last month in Songjiang County, in which an old man was injured, was reported to the land and water public security agencies for investigation, but no news was received. Recently, Yang Shijie, the captain of the Public Security Bureau's detective team, learned that a certain Fang was among the bandits in this case, residing in Litahui Township. He sent someone to secretly investigate. When Fang's wife fell ill and returned home, she came to Songjiang yesterday to buy things. Captain Yang, based on a tip-off, went to Dacang Bridge with detective Shen Guichang to meet Fang and arrested him. When questioned, he said his name was Fang Ziguang, and he was being escorted back to the county bureau. While passing through Xita Lane, the thief remained expressionless and ran away in the lane. Yang and others chased after him and captured him in a paddy field. After taking him to the bureau for interrogation, he confessed without denial. A pawn ticket was found and checked at the Yifeng pawnshop. It was a Huchou silk fabric and was indeed one of the stolen goods from the ferry. The clothes he was wearing were also stolen goods sewn by hired workers. Based on the confession, Yang and others heard that another thief had been captured in Ganxiang, and there were still bandits at large. They are buying leads and tracking them down separately.</p>

<p>The local native goods industry is currently facing sluggish business and is in a state of depression. However, the Business Tax Bureau believes that the annual package quota of 2,000 yuan for the native goods industry is too low and plans to increase it from the autumn. The industry believes that the existing tax burden of 2,000 yuan is already too heavy, and it will be impossible to bear any further increase. Therefore, Wang Mengsheng has been designated as a representative to request a reduction from the Business Tax Bureau, with the minimum requirement that there should be no increase. However, this has not been approved, and the industry is extremely indignant and plans to follow the rice industry's example by staging a complete strike to resist. The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations are currently mediating.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Zhenjiang: Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Asks Songyun Office to Revoke Punishments for Various Soy Sauce Workshops <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Songjiang Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, stating that Song Junjian, Deputy Salt Transport Commissioner of Songjiang, had received a submission from Liu Zhuoyun, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Soy Sauce Industry Association, and five soy sauce industry representatives, including Zhou Shoutian, Tan Jingru, Zhang Xingru, Zhao Huiqing, Cai Fengxiang, and Liu Huanzhang, stating that they had received a letter from the Zhenjiang Zhejiang Salt Main Depot, forwarding a letter from the Zhejiang West Su Five Prefecture Salt Merchants Association, forwarding Instruction No. 1604 from the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Commissioner's Office, which stated: "According to an investigation, the Su Five Prefecture monitoring stations have reported in the soy sauce sales lists for the 23rd year that soy sauce workshops in Yixing, Jintan, and Liyang counties did not receive official salt throughout the year, and soy sauce workshops in Zhenjiang County received excessive amounts of official salt. It is suspected that there are cases of privately increasing vat openings and purchasing illicit salt. The office dispatched Ling Xichao, Chief of the Sixth District of the Su Five Prefecture Tax Police, Liu Shengqi, a clerk from the Songjiang Branch, and Ding Shiding, a clerk from this office, to conduct a thorough investigation after April 30 this year. Now, according to the report from the said officials, the actual situation has been investigated, and measures for suppression and correction have been drafted. We request that these measures be reviewed and implemented, and the investigation report on the vat openings of each soy sauce workshop, the table of salt consumption by soy sauce workshops, the table of refined salt used for soy sauce production by soy sauce workshops, and various vat opening documents are attached. It has been found that the names and garden names of most of the soy sauce workshops in Zhenjiang do not match the licenses, indicating that they are operating under borrowed licenses, using large vats and refined salt for soy sauce production, and privately increasing vat openings. These are serious violations of the regulations and damage to tax revenue. As for the soy sauce workshops in Yixing and Liyang counties, although the violations are less serious, they are still illegal. Based on the report, in addition to submitting the proposed suppression and correction measures to the department for review and implementation and issuing public notices separately, we will also determine the supplementary donations and fines and the revocation of licenses in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of the Soy Sauce Workshop Suppression Regulations. We order the association to comply immediately, relay the instructions to the soy sauce workshops in each area, and promptly prepare the vat donation fines and the original licenses according to the list and submit them to the office within half a month for verification and handling, without any delay. Furthermore, any soy sauce workshops found operating without a license will be severely punished. We also order you to publicize and comply with these instructions. This is extremely important." Another Instruction No. 1690 from the Songjiang Hall Transport Deputy Commissioner's Office stated: "An investigation has revealed that the soy sauce workshops in Zhenjiang, Yixing, and Liyang are operating under borrowed licenses and have privately increased vat openings. This office has previously dispatched personnel to conduct further investigations and has determined the supplementary donations and punishments. On June 29 this year, Instruction No. 1604 was issued to the association, ordering compliance. Now, more than a month has passed, and no report has been received. What are the merchants Hengchang and Zhang Yiyuan doing? This is extremely dilatory. We hereby issue another order urging you to comply immediately, relay the instructions to the soy sauce workshops, order them to prepare the vat donation fines and the original licenses according to the list, and submit them to the office by August 15 for verification and handling. If there is any further delay or hesitation, the police will be instructed to enforce the order against each household according to the list, or revoke the licenses and order them to cease operations, as a warning. The merchants Zhang Hengchang and Zhang Yiyuan, who are responsible for guaranteeing compliance but have failed to do so despite repeated urging, shall be held jointly liable and ordered to pay the vat donation fines. Consider this a warning. Also, publicize this knowledge without delay. This is extremely important." Copies of the Soy Sauce Workshop Suppression Regulations are attached. How are the regulations stipulated? Since there has been no clear notification and salt has been purchased repeatedly, the depot has never refused due to discrepancies in the licenses and has never provided guidance. Therefore, since the fourth year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty until now, more than seventy years have passed, and there have been countless mergers and transfers. This has become a habit. The vat licenses are obtained by the depot on behalf of the workshops. Recently, due to doubts about the amount of donations, we have truthfully presented our plight and requested that the old licenses be exempted from revocation and the punishment be revoked. However, we believe that requiring soy sauce workshops to obtain vat licenses is only a special measure in Su Wu Prefecture and Zhejiang Province, and no other provinces have such a special prohibition. Even Yangzhou, which is nearby, does not have it. Recently, since soy sauce has been sold throughout the country, soy sauce made in areas where the tax rates on Huai salt are lighter has been shipped to Zhenjiang in full loads. The business of merchants has been greatly affected. As leaders of the merchants, we are more familiar with the situation and should be more concerned. Therefore, we have jointly appealed to you, requesting that the chairman review the situation and allow us to present the difficulties of the merchants to avoid innocent people being punished and harming their business." Based on this, we believe that the suffering described by the merchants is real. The market has been depressed in recent years, and business has been slow. If we apply the regulations, it will be difficult for them to bear. Moreover, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang are separated by a river, and the measures are clearly different. Since soy sauce has been sold throughout the country, soy sauce from Jiangbei, made with Huai salt, has been flowing in. The suffering of Zhenjiang merchants is already difficult to express. If we impose harsh regulations that do not exist in other provinces, how can they maintain their business? Therefore, we are reporting the situation and requesting that you review it. We hope that you will consider the plight of the Zhenjiang soy sauce merchants and approve the revocation of the original punishment and grant exceptional leniency. We eagerly await your instructions. Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce seal.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously ordered the counties under the Huai River to collect a small amount of money per mu or per tax for guiding the Huai River. The Louzhuang Township Farmers' Association of Taixian County, together with others, submitted a further report to the Ministry of Finance on July 17 this year, stating that this money was the same as the funds collected per mu in Huaian for guiding the Huai River, and it was the same as adding a surcharge to the land tax, which contradicted the clear order of the National Government in the 23rd year that the land tax would never be increased. They requested that the provincial government be consulted and the case be closed, and that this type of money be corrected and stopped completely. On the 17th of this month, the Ministry of Finance approved, "The report has been received and understood. It is hereby ordered to consult the Jiangsu Provincial Government, quickly merge the case and correct it, and transfer it to the Ministry for review."</p>

<h3 id="e96">Old Ningshao Steamer and Beian Steamer Collide in Huangpu River This Morning. Ningshao More Severely Damaged, Beian Slightly Damaged. Both Parties Report to Navigation Bureau, etc. <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Northern Shipping Company's Beian steamer, with a capacity of 3,585.89 tons, unloaded coal in Shanghai and set sail from the Zhonghua Wharf at 4:00 a.m. yesterday, heading to Nanjing to load cargo. At around 5:00 a.m., it arrived at the Huangpu River near the Waibaidu Bridge, i.e., the Lujiazui River surface. At the same time, the Ningshao Company's Old Ningshao steamer, replacing the New Ningshao, was operating the Ningbo route. The steamer, with a capacity of 2,642 tons, was fully loaded with passengers and cargo and arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning. It arrived at Lujiazui at 5:00 a.m. The Ningshao steamer saw the Beian steamer departing and sounded its horn three times. The Beian steamer did not change its course, resulting in both steamers being unable to avoid each other when they approached, leading to a head-on collision. Due to the excessive force of the impact, the bow of the Ningshao steamer was completely destroyed. The iron plates on both sides were completely dented, and a large hole was punched in the right side of the bow. Both anchor holes were also destroyed. The bow of the Beian steamer was also damaged on both sides, and a large hole was also punched in the right side. Although the Beian steamer was empty, the extent of the damage seemed to be less severe than that of the Ningshao.</p>
<p>Report by Shipowners</p>
<p>After the incident, the Ningshao steamed to the wharf, and passengers disembarked and unloaded the cargo. The Beian steamer was also unable to leave the port and changed to anchoring at buoy No. 21, awaiting inspection and repair. According to the report of the Ningshao steamer's owner, when his ship was sailing in front of the Yisong Shipyard, he saw the Beian steamer coming. The Ningshao sounded its horn once in advance, but the Beian did not respond. The Ningshao sounded its horn again, but the Beian still did not respond. On the third sounding of the horn, the Beian responded once. At that time, the steamers were approaching each other, and the Ningshao quickly sounded its horn twice, and the Beian also responded twice. However, the Beian did not change its course. The Ningshao steamer steered to the left, and the Beian also steered to the left, making it impossible to avoid each other, resulting in a collision and causing this disaster. The owner of the Beian steamer reported that when he saw the Ningshao, he first sounded his horn three times, then sounded his horn three times again, and told the Ningshao steamer that the Beian had stopped. At that time, the tide was rising rapidly, and the Ningshao was proceeding very quickly with the tide. The Beian was sailing on the Puxi side. When the steamers approached each other, they collided. The truth of the matter needs to be determined by impartial persons and ship inspectors.</p>
<p>Both Suffered Great Losses</p>
<p>The bow of the Ningshao steamer was almost completely destroyed. The outer iron plates of the bow were broken, the keel was also damaged, and all other internal decorations were damaged. It is completely unable to sail. According to people in the company, the loss will be at least 16,000 to 17,000 yuan. As for the Beian steamer, because there are no cabins, the loss is relatively light, but it cannot sail either. It must be repaired in the factory before it can sail.</p>
<p>Various Reports of Inspection</p>
<p>After the Old Ningshao unloaded its cargo and passengers, the company telegraphed the Jiangnan Shipyard to send a tugboat to the Ningshao Wharf. At around 3:00 p.m., the Shao steamer was towed to Gaochangmiao, preparing for major repairs. However, in order to inspect the losses, the Ningshao Company reported to the Maritime Affairs Bureau and the China Ship Insurance Federation, requesting that technicians be sent to inspect the ship. At the same time, Yisong, Ruirong, and Jiangnan Shipyards were also requested to send engineers to Gaochangmiao at 8:00 a.m. this morning to survey the damage and then carry out major repairs. The Beian steamer was also reported by the Northern Company to the Maritime Affairs Bureau and foreign insurance companies, requesting that personnel be sent to buoy No. 21 to inspect it before repairing it.</p>
<p>Ningbo Route Suspended</p>
<p>The Ningshao Company's Shanghai-Ningbo route New Ningshao steamer is currently undergoing routine repairs, and the Old Ningshao steamer is temporarily used as a substitute. The regular routes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday have been suspended because the Ningshao steamer was damaged and cannot sail without major repairs. Therefore, the Ningbo route steamer that should have departed yesterday was temporarily suspended. Most of the passengers going to Ningbo went to the French Concession and changed to the Taikoo New Beijing steamer, so the New Beijing departure last night was crowded with passengers, which was rare. The Ningshao will have to suspend another route tomorrow. Yesterday, the company telegraphed Ningbo to inform them that the New Ningshao steamer can be repaired and leave the factory next Monday and officially resume sailing.</p>

<p>The Tongli steamer of the Tongcheng Company in this port set sail from Tanggu to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 15th of this month. When it was sailing near the fourth section of the port surface, the Xintai steamer of the Xintai Steamer Company followed behind. It came closer and closer. At that time, it blew its horn to indicate that it wanted to pass the Tongli. The Tongli replied that it could, so it slowed down and stopped to wait for the Xintai to pass first. However, the Xintai was traveling too fast, causing the stern to run aground on the north beach, and the bow suddenly turned to the left, pushed by the tide, and collided violently with the Tongcheng steamer, causing damage to the right side of the Tongli. The company has requested compensation from the Xintai Steamer Company. The owner of the Xintai reported that the Tongli was blocking the port surface. He has reported this to the Shanghai Insurance Company yesterday, requesting that both parties conduct an inspection to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Yongheng Hits Civilian Ship</p>
<p>The Yongheng steamer of the Wing On Steamship Company loaded cargo from Shanghai to Tianjin this time. Yesterday, it received a telegram from Tianjin stating that the Yongheng steamer sailed into Dagukou at 4:00 a.m. on the 16th, heading to Tianjin with the tide. When it arrived near Tanggu, it encountered the Japanese ship Huashan Maru. In order to avoid the Japanese ship, the Yongheng crashed a civilian ship on the Tanggu River. At the same time, due to the impact of the civilian ship, the Yongheng also damaged the Zhenxing Wharf. The damage is currently being inspected, and the extent of the damage is awaiting further reports from the shipowner. He has already telegraphed the insurance company yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e98">International Convention on Load Lines for Ships: Our Country Officially Joins <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Our country's participation in the International Convention on Load Lines for Ships was submitted by the Ministry of Communications to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Navy to draft their opinions and forward them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval. The National Government then ordered the Executive Yuan to forward them to the Ministry of Communications, which forwarded them to the local Maritime Affairs Bureaus. The details of the process are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Submits Request to Executive Yuan for Review</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that more than 30 countries around the world have joined the International Convention on Load Lines, and our country did not join it in the past because the shipping industry was not yet developed. Now that the country is planning to develop the shipping industry, the mutual relations between international navigation will inevitably become closer. In order to facilitate international navigation and protect the safety of life and property at sea, it is felt that it is necessary to join this convention. The ministry has attached a translated version and the original text of the convention and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review, and asked the Executive Yuan to forward them to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. After receiving the report, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Navy to review it.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Navy Draft Opinions</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Customs Administration to forward the convention to the General Inspectorate of Customs for review. Subsequently, the General Inspectorate submitted its proposed opinions to the Ministry of Finance, arguing that training personnel should be prioritized before considering joining the convention.

The Inspection Bureau yesterday issued the detailed rules for the implementation of flour inspection as follows: Article 1: These detailed rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the Commodity Inspection Law (hereinafter referred to as the Law). Article 2: All flour imported from abroad shall, before customs declaration, fill in the inspection application form to the local Commodity Inspection Bureau (hereinafter referred to as the Inspection Bureau), together with the inspection fee, and apply for inspection.

Select 8 bags for 100 bags or less, 15 bags for more than 100 bags but less than 1,000 bags, and 20 bags for more than 1,000 bags but less than 10,000 bags. Each bag shall contain 4 liang (125 grams) of the market system. 2. Mix the goods mentioned in the previous paragraph together, extract 2 jin (1,000 grams) of the market system (divided into four bottles) and seal them with the sampler's seal. One bottle shall be used for inspection, one bottle shall be kept by the applicant, and two bottles shall be stored in the bureau for reference. The rest shall be sent back on site. 3. The samples shall be selected by the sampler, and the applicant shall not designate them. 4. After the sampling is completed, the sampler shall add a seal to each package and issue a sampling certificate. The sampling certificate shall be numbered by the Inspection Bureau and signed and issued by the sampler. Article 4: The order of inspection shall be based on the order in which the inspection application forms are received, and the procedure shall be completed within two days after sampling. Sundays and other holidays may be extended accordingly, but when necessary, work may be carried out as usual. Article 5: The standards for qualified flour inspection are as follows: 1.

An application for re-inspection of unqualified flour shall be made within 14 days of receiving the notice of unqualified status, and the original inspection application form shall be submitted.

<p>The Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee held its eighth meeting on the 20th. The attending committee members were Cai Zengji, Du Yuesheng, Chen Guangfu, Bei Songsun (replaced by Chen Guangfu), Song Ziliang, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Zuoting, Zhang Peikun, and Xi Demao, totaling ten individuals. During the meeting, they reviewed twenty-two applications for small credit loans that had been investigated and reviewed. After reviewing each case, they were divided into three categories: "approved for loan," "approved with reduced loan amount," and "rejected." The approved applications were processed accordingly. Eight applications were approved for the full amount requested, eleven were approved with reduced loan amounts, and one was rejected. Two applications were approved pending the guarantor's written confirmation of guarantee. The total amount of small loans approved was over 27,000 yuan. It is reported that recently, there has been a steady stream of applications to the committee. The completion of the application forms is mostly guided voluntarily by the Lixin Accounting Firm on Ningbo Road, and errors have gradually decreased. Therefore, if industrial and commercial firms wish to apply for loans but are unsure of the form completion procedures, they should first consult the Lixin Accounting Firm for guidance to facilitate the process. In addition, to show consideration for the difficulties of industrial and commercial businesses applying for loans and to thoroughly implement the initial intention of relief, the committee also proposed at this meeting: (1) to grant small loans to semi-industrial, commercial, and small businesses with flexibility to provide widespread relief; and (2) to modify the repayment period for small credit loans to a maximum of one year. Both proposals were approved and will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation. The original text of the proposals is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Flexible Lending for Small Loans</p>
<p>(1) Proposal to grant small loans to semi-industrial, commercial, and small businesses with flexibility to provide widespread relief. The original text of the proposal states: "It is noted that the restrictions in the loan regulations were too strict during the seventh meeting of this committee. A study on flexible measures within possible limits should be conducted to facilitate implementation." After discussion, it was decided that Chairman Cai and representatives from various banks would conduct a detailed study and submit the results for discussion at the next meeting. On the 15th of this month, Zengji convened representatives from various banks to jointly conduct a study. It was generally agreed that since the committee had already proposed to the Ministry of Finance a plan for flexible guarantee methods, the most difficult point for applicants would be resolved upon approval. It seemed unnecessary to amend the other points in the regulations. However, for semi-industrial businesses applying for loans under 500 yuan and small businesses applying for loans under 200 yuan, if the guarantor is found to be reliable and creditworthy, even if their own financial strength is insufficient, flexible handling and lending should be considered. Furthermore, applicants with sufficient financial strength and the ability to repay the loan may be granted a waiver of security to align with the initial intention of widespread relief. The results of the joint study are now submitted for discussion to determine if they are appropriate. Proposer: Chairman Cai Zengji."</p>
<p>Modified Repayment Period for Small Loans</p>
<p>(2) Proposal to modify the repayment period for small credit loans to a maximum of one year. The original text of the proposal states: "It is noted that according to Article 9 of the ten principles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance regarding the repayment period for small credit loans, repayment should be made at the end of the term according to market practice. In reality, the latest loans issued must be repaid by the end of this year, leaving loan applicants with only a short period of four months to use the funds, which is not very beneficial. Currently, most applicants request a repayment period of one year or eight months. In consideration of practical circumstances and to thoroughly implement the initial intention of relief, it seems appropriate to modify the repayment period for small credit loans, referring to the regulations for mortgage loans, to a maximum of one year. With such a longer term, borrowers can benefit more and avoid the difficulty of tight credit at the end of the term. This would also contribute to market stability. It is submitted for discussion to determine if it is appropriate. Proposer: Chairman Cai Zengji."</p>

<p>According to the "National News," the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is planning to provide tung oil loans to Zhejiang Province at the request of the Zhejiang Construction Department. After repeated negotiations between the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and the Zhejiang Construction Department, a draft loan agreement has been agreed upon. It has also been decided that local branches of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will directly provide loans to farmers, with an interest rate starting at 9%. Once the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau sends representatives to conduct an investigation, a contract can be signed and loan disbursement can begin. Currently, the Zhejiang Construction Department has specially dispatched Chen Zhongming from the Cooperative Management Committee to Shanghai to request the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to send representatives to various counties as soon as possible to conduct investigations so that loans can be disbursed earlier.</p>

<p>Repeatedly Consulting the Municipal Government for Investigation and Punishment of Similar Exchanges and Businesses. The city's five exchanges, including the Gold Industry Exchange, the Chinese Securities Exchange, the Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange, and the Flour, Grains, and Oilseed Cake Exchange, yesterday received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, Qian Zi No. 6762, stating: "A submission has been received requesting the legal prohibition of illegal commercial organizations engaged in trading similar to exchanges and the protection of legitimate businesses. Your submission is acknowledged. Previously, Xu Fenghui and the supervisors of the Shanghai Exchange successively submitted lists of Shanghai area businesses engaged in illegal margin trading, requesting their prohibition. Copies of the lists were sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation and strict handling according to the law, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was also notified for verification and handling. Now, based on the previous situation, in addition to again notifying the Shanghai Municipal Government to expedite the investigation and punishment of these cases and notifying the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, you are hereby notified. This is a reply dated August 19, 24th year of the Republic of China, from Minister Kong Xiangxi."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Request to Waive Stamp Tax on Checks; Original Letter from the Bankers Association to the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association is submitting another case requesting the amendment of the Stamp Tax Law. The previous reply from the Ministry of Finance was not adopted. However, the industry believes that the stamp tax on checks greatly hinders the circulation of negotiable instruments and the turnover of funds. Therefore, they are submitting another request to the Ministry of Finance to maintain the old policy and allow for exemption from stamp tax. The original text is recorded as follows: "Submission regarding the earnest request to maintain the old policy and temporarily postpone the stamp tax on checks. A reply was received from your ministry on July 23, Tax Zi No. 6380, regarding the case submitted by the association and others requesting the amendment of the new Stamp Tax Law, with attached opinions. After careful reading, it is noted that the item regarding checks was approved by your ministry in 1929 for exemption from stamp tax. The new Stamp Tax Law now classifies this type of negotiable instrument as an important document and changes it to a stamp tax of two cents per item. This is already a light levy among the taxes. It can be seen that the legislation has profound implications. We should not discuss it again. However, the current financial situation is severely depleted. Encouraging the circulation of credit instruments is an urgent priority. Even if the market has one more turnover chip, it can indirectly reduce the outflow of social funds and contribute to the country's economic construction. Furthermore, although the tax liability for checks belongs to the drawer, most ordinary depositors have not yet developed the habit of using checks. Adding this burden will not only hinder the implementation of the function but also make existing customers who understand the effectiveness of checks and issue more checks inevitably reluctant to use them and worry about penalties for missing stamps. Therefore, for various reasons, check users will inevitably tend to use passbooks for payment. The number of checks will decrease accordingly, and cash movement will inevitably increase. Those who are cunning will benefit from the convenience of checks but also worry about the stamp duty and may turn to foreign banks. In theory, Chinese and foreign parties are the same and subject to the same penalties, but in practice, there are many complications, which have a considerable impact on financial security. After repeated consideration, the association believes that the time is not yet ripe for stamp tax on checks. The other points requested for amendment in the original opinion have been explained and should be followed. Therefore, we are submitting another request to your ministry for approval to maintain the old policy and temporarily postpone the stamp tax. The new Stamp Tax Law will be implemented on the first day of next month. Before it is finalized in this city, we should also request that all inspection agencies be notified to handle the inspection of stamp tax on checks with leniency to avoid disputes. We deeply hope that your ministry will approve this request and we will be grateful for your convenience."</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, recently went north to inspect the Yellow River flood disaster. He first went to counties in western Shandong, then to Lanfeng, Laocheng in Henan, and Dongming, Changyuan, and Puyang in Hebei, completing his official duties. He returned south on the 20th and arrived in Beijing last night. In addition to reporting the Yellow River disaster situation and undertaking disaster relief, he plans to come to Shanghai on the 24th to attend the first standing committee meeting of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces to be held on the 25th. The association also received a telegram from Xu Shiying in Bian reporting on the disaster situation. The excerpt is as follows: "To the President, Vice Presidents, Directors, Deputy Directors, Secretaries-General, and Gentlemen of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces: I departed from Kaifeng this morning, traveled along the south bank of the Yellow River embankment, and passed through Lanfeng, Kaocheng in Henan, Dongming, Changyuan, Puyang in Hebei, and Heze and Juancheng in Shandong, totaling seven counties. I did not reach the Dongzhuang gate. The ground level in Kaifeng is lower than the river level, and the future danger is worrying. The Kaocheng Civil Levee has been raised and a protective embankment has been built, so there should be no problem. The Yellow River disaster in Hebei Province only affects Dongming, Changyuan, and Puyang, three counties. The disaster area is relatively small. The disaster victims number about 200,000 people. However, houses and farmland in the river beach have been flooded, and there is deep water accumulation inside the embankment. Most of the victims have moved to the embankment, and the disaster situation is dire. At the junction of Hebei and Shandong provinces, the Liu Zhuang embankment is facing a dangerous situation. The river affairs bureaus of the two provinces are working on reinforcement. The storage of materials is being prepared. Heze and Juancheng counties are the most severely affected areas in Shandong Province. More than 10,000 disaster victims are gathered on the embankment. Their faces are pale and their bodies are thin. The situation is unbearable. The Dongzhuang No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 gates have been silted up and cut off. However, the No. 5 and 6 gates have merged into one and are 800 zhang wide. The main flood is over 200 zhang wide. The large flows from both rivers have entered the breach. 90% of the people in Shandong want the breach to be closed urgently. Chairman Han and Committee Chairman Li Yizhi are holding a procedural meeting on closing the breach in Dongzhuang in a few days and have reported to the Yuanhui. However, it is heard that there has been unprecedented heavy rain in Ningxia. It is expected that around the date before, the disaster area in the lower reaches of Henan and Shandong will not be large, but the disaster situation will definitely worsen, which is very worrying. Shiying returned to Bian late at night and is now returning to Beijing to report to the Zhenwu Committee. Committee Chairman Xu Shiying. Mao Si 4."</p>
<p>Yesterday (August 21), this newspaper received fundraising donations for flood relief in various provinces, including four yuan from Mr. Huang Puqi and one yuan from an anonymous person, totaling five yuan.</p>

It is scheduled to move to the new location at the end of this month and open for business before the autumn fishing season. The internal work of the market's preparatory committee is extremely busy. All measures have been finalized. The cooperation issue between the market and the fish trade has also been resolved. Brokers have begun to be recruited. Many people have come to the committee for contact, especially those from the Sixteen Shop fish trade. However, it is heard that the qualifications for brokers are extremely strict, and the number is limited to only ten. Those who do not have strong capital and a good reputation in the fishing industry may find it difficult to be selected. It is rumored that the candidates have already been internally selected and will be announced soon.</p>

<p>After the new Stamp Tax Law takes effect on September 1, the stamp tax for ledgers will be 2 jiao per book per year, which is different from the current Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, which is 1 jiao per book per year. The City Chamber of Commerce recently received inquiries from various industries asking whether old ledgers that have not been used up and continue to be used after September 1 should be stamped with an additional 1 jiao. The City Chamber of Commerce immediately provided detailed instructions based on the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Stamp Tax Law and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting an explanatory order. The letters and telegrams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>"To the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: According to the Stamp Tax Provisional Regulations, the effective period of stamp tax payment on continuing to use ledgers should be until the end of the year's commercial closing date or the end of its designated accounting year and does not need to be fully stamped with 2 jiao according to the Stamp Tax Law. This is a natural interpretation based on legal principles. Inquiries from various places sometimes have doubts about this. Please, your ministry, issue an explanatory order to avoid suspicion and misunderstanding. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Reply to the Silverware Industry Letter</p>
<p>"Direct reply: We received your letter on the 20th of this month asking whether ledgers used before September should be fully stamped with 2 jiao after the new Stamp Tax Law takes effect. This matter can be discussed in two layers: (1) According to the principle of not applying the law retroactively, the Stamp Tax Provisional Regulations are not governed by the new Stamp Tax Law that takes effect on September 1. (2) The issue of the effective period should be discussed. Although the Stamp Tax Provisional Regulations have been abolished after the Stamp Tax Law takes effect, the effective period of stamp tax stamps affixed to ledgers that have not been used up according to the Regulations should be until the end of the year's commercial closing date according to Article 10 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Stamp Tax Law. The tax rate effect of the Regulations on the ledgers has not disappeared. There is no need to stamp again at this time. To the Shanghai Silverware Industry Association."</p>

Then, representatives reported on production and sales. After discussion, it was decided that the bureau would formulate detailed measures before proceeding further. At the same time, cotton cloth merchants will submit samples for the bureau to collect and send to Southeast Asia to promote the trade.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Guangxi Finance Department Imposes Additional Yarn Tax; Yarn Mill Association Appeals for Exemption <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Yarn Mill Association sent a letter to the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "We respectfully inform you that we received a letter from the Wuzhou Flower Yarn Industry Association stating that the province held a business tax last year, considering cotton yarn as a necessity for people's livelihood. Therefore, the business tax for selling cotton yarn was halved compared to other industries, levied at 2 per mille. Now, the tax rate has been revised, and all industries are taxed at 6 per mille, and the halved rate for cotton yarn has also been abolished. Our industry's burden has suddenly increased by two-thirds. All donations and fees required for cotton yarn from Shanghai to Guangxi have reached more than 20 yuan per package. Current sales are already sluggish, and it is impossible to increase costs further. We earnestly request that you transfer the request to reduce the levy to 2 per mille or halve the rate to avoid collapse. Cotton yarn sales have been declining in recent years. Fortunately, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have purchased more. The cost of transporting Shanghai yarn to the south has already been large. If the business tax of 4 per mille is suddenly increased, the cost will increase again, and sales will inevitably decrease. Manufacturers and yarn merchants in Guangxi Province will suffer, and even Guangxi's tax revenue may not increase. Therefore, we earnestly request that you transfer the situation to the Guangxi Finance Department and ask them to continue to levy the Wuzhou cotton yarn business tax at the old rate. If an appropriate increase is necessary, please follow the previous method of halving the tax rate to benefit yarn sales and maintain the factory industry. Please examine and approve this request."</p>

<p>Yuan Lianghua, director of the Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, recently went to Beijing to meet with the authorities and report on the current situation of the office and make some requests. He returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is learned that Director Yuan went to Beijing this time because the autumn fishing season is approaching and fishermen are about to go fishing again. The office has worked hard in recent years to prevent pirates and protect fishermen. However, fearing that the power is weak, he requested the Navy to provide assistance at any time. The result was very satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Song Municipal Government Asks to Repair the Seawall; There Are Also Collapsed Parts in the Baoshan Section <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The tide outside the Wusong mouth has been high recently, and the sky is often hazy, which is a sign of storms. The seawall in the Songbao area, in its important places, has been repaired last year, and the seawall is still considered solid. However, the sections such as the Five Peaks Mound in the Baoshan section were attacked by the storm tide in June 1933. The piles and stone beaches in each section collapsed a lot, and the soil was loose and sinking. When it was repaired last year, due to funding reasons, several projects in the area were not repaired in the end. The tide has risen greatly in recent days, and the damage to each section is even greater. Now, Yan Fenlou and others from the Baoshan Tangdong have telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government to quickly allocate the 100,000 yuan of seawall funds listed in the provincial budget for 1935 and estimate the construction to avoid major disasters. It is learned that the Tanjiabang North section of the seawall in the Wusong District of this city was originally a temporary emergency project during the hurricane in 1933. After two years, the Jiangchao has washed away and there are many defects. If it is attacked by a violent storm, there may be a risk of collapse. Yesterday, Wu Song Municipal Commissioner Yin Gongtian, together with gentlemen Gu Zhouchao and Zhang Panshi, went to inspect and immediately prepared a document to submit to the Municipal Government to order the Bureau of Public Works to send personnel to repair it quickly to avoid danger.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Sino-Foreign Relief Association: Report Received on the Hubei Flood Disaster <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association on Jen Kee Road recently received the first report on the Hubei Sino-Foreign Relief inspection of the Hankou to Caidian Xiang River flood disaster. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Conditions along the route: since the association's vessel sailed upstream, the north bank from Tuoluokou and the south bank from Qinduankou and above were indistinguishable from the sky and water, with no shore to be found. The willow tips floating on the water were like duckweed, and the exposed tile ridges were like floating gulls. (2) Residence of the victims: on the south bank, from Heshan to Ma'anshan, the victims' shelters were either closely packed or simply mats on the ground beneath the sky. This information was obtained through telescopes, so it was not possible to capture videos. (3) The state of Caidian: this city belongs to the second district of Hanyang and is known for its prosperous commerce, unmatched by any other. Currently, the entire city is flooded, with boats traveling through the main streets, all businesses suspended, and the people showing signs of hunger. (4) Causes of the disaster: the city is located by the Han River, with the Xiangyongti and other embankments acting as a barrier in the rear. On July 12th, the Xinzhakou Sanhe and other embankments of the Xiang River successively collapsed. The Han River, being at a higher elevation, rushed in, and the Jiudouti and others also collapsed due to the breach of the Lanjian dike. Therefore, within a few hours, the water reached the eaves. According to the watermarks, although the water level has dropped by about five feet, the city's houses are still half-submerged in the water, and the area outside the city is a vast expanse of water, all fertile farmland. (5) Victims awaiting relief: due to the sudden flood, goods and food in the city were washed away, the autumn harvest is hopeless, and the death toll is estimated to be over 500. The people are all without food and awaiting relief. The farmers are especially hoping for the distribution of autumn seeds. The Hubei Relief General Association of the Commercial Red Swastika Society has allocated several thousand yuan to purchase and distribute food, but this is insufficient due to the large number of victims. A second report was received after inspecting the fifth district of Hanyang and Xinkou Town, on the Nang River flood: (1) Causes of the disaster: the district borders the Han River in the front and is traversed by the Fu River (Xinkou). The town is located at the mouth of the river, on the extreme south, and relies on the Honghu dike of Hanchuan to block the western water. Unexpectedly, on July 7th, the Hong dike collapsed, and Kangjia Yuan in the fifth district was the first to be submerged. Subsequently, due to the expansion of the Yuan, it breached the Kang dike and converged with the Fu River. Moreover, the high water level of the Han River hindered its discharge, causing it to rush horizontally into the Yihe Tiesuo and other Yuans, flooding the entire district. Although the water level has now dropped by five feet, except for the dikes where the victims can set up shelters, the rest of the district's fields and houses are still half-submerged in the water. (2) The situation of the disaster: Xinshi had been heavily flooded, but has now receded, leaving muddy streets and a foul odor. The district had already harvested 80% of the spring crop this year. The stored grain was completely submerged within a day due to the sudden flood, and the autumn harvest is also hopeless, resulting in a very tragic situation, with hungry people grabbing food. (3) Inspection of the disaster area: today, together with the district chief and others, we took a boat up the Fu River to inspect the breached dikes in areas such as Yihe Tiesuo and Kangjia Yuan. Countless houses were collapsing into the water. Moreover, the entire district has no high ground. Not only do the people have no place to settle, but there are also no burial sites for the floating corpses that are being salvaged. Photos were taken to document the tragic situation.</p>

<p>Due to dissatisfaction with the mutual aid society's unfair use of their membership fees, rickshaw pullers in the Special District sent nine representatives, including Cang Gongyou, Zhu Fengxiang, Xu Zhulin, Zhu Richang, Lu Deguang, Xing Riqing, Sun Shihe, Li Yourong, and Ma Taizhi, to petition Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce at the Municipal Council, requesting (1) to serve as chairman of the mutual aid society, (2) to convene a new board meeting, and (3) to ask the Municipal Council to order the mutual aid society to publish its accounts. Mr. Yu replied that the board of directors will hold a meeting within a week to discuss this and advised the rickshaw pullers to wait for a resolution. At the same time, the Rickshaw Pullers Association also sent a letter to Mr. Frelippo, acting general manager of the Municipal Council, and Yao Zengmo, the chief Chinese inspector, requesting that a solution be formulated as soon as possible to stabilize the rickshaw pullers' work.</p>

<p>Since the government advocated cooperative undertakings, domestic cooperative enterprises have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Although there were also one or two cooperatives established earlier in this city, they were all small in scale and insufficient for development. It is said that Mr. Yin Rangneng is very knowledgeable about cooperative undertakings. In view of the frequent disasters and economic exhaustion in recent years, and the people's hardships being worse than in the past, the implementation of cooperative undertakings is particularly urgent. Now, taking action rather than just talking, he has initiated the establishment of Shanghai Citizens' Production, Consumption, Credit, and Insurance Limited Cooperative, and has obtained the sponsorship of Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Xu Shiying, and others. Currently, they are engaged in raising capital. It is also said that its future business will focus on developing agriculture and industry, and circulating finance, lending funds necessary for production and manufacturing to members at low interest rates. It also seeks mutual assistance and handles insurance for all unexpected events of members. Therefore, after the establishment of this cooperative, it will be of great benefit to society.</p>

Beyond this limit, the exceeding portion will still be charged according to the regulations. (2) For this free storage period, excluding the original seven days, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will bear 50% of the storage fee. To facilitate settlement with Tianjin-Pukou, the Maigen Road stationmaster should promptly list the actual storage dates of each batch of goods in detail when the free storage period ends in mid-October and submit it to the responsible section for processing. (3) The quantity of goods eligible for one month of free storage is limited to 15,000 tons. If this amount is about to be reached or the capacity of the Maigen Station's warehouses is about to be full, the stationmaster should promptly report to the responsible section for approval. (4) When goods arrive, the Maigen Station should conduct a particularly detailed inspection. If there is any dampness, it should be immediately reported to the responsible section for approval. (5) During the same period (from August 15th to September 14th), goods shipped from various stations of this railway and other connecting railways to the Maigen Station will also receive special preferential treatment, with a free storage period of 15 days, without tonnage restrictions.</p>

<p>Mr. Ray, the American telephone expert, arrived in Shanghai at 9 a.m. the day before yesterday. Those who welcomed him at the port included Mr. Frelippo, acting general manager of the Municipal Council, Mr. Ford, head of the Finance Department, and telephone experts from China, Britain, America, and Japan. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, a preliminary meeting was held at the Municipal Council office to exchange opinions on the subsequent investigation. The inspection of the various stations of the telephone company by the experts from China, Britain, and Japan had been completed the day before yesterday. After the arrival of the American expert in Shanghai, he may need to conduct a separate inspection for a week. According to those familiar with the matter, the equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Company is largely the same as that of the Bell System telephone company, which is common in the United States and well-known to the American expert. Therefore, the inspection can be completed within a day or two. As for the subsequent work outline, it is said that the four experts will hold a discussion meeting once a day, consulting with the Shanghai Telephone Company authorities on everything at any time. If there is a need to go out for investigation, the four experts will go together and will not act alone. The reporter met with Mr. Hu Ruixiang, a Chinese telephone expert, again the day before yesterday. Mr. Hu said that he is currently starting the investigation of the telephone issue and has no opinion to express for the time being. As for the opinions of various Chinese commercial and civic organizations, he has met with all parties in the past week. Regarding the situation in this city, it is best for the various organizations and institutions to provide opinions to the expert committee at any time, so that other experts can also understand the public opinion of the related organizations in our country.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Retailers Association has repeatedly received reports from members that the price of foreign goods has recently increased sharply without decrease, and that many stores are being opened by people from other industries, resulting in competition and disputes, leading to operating losses and maintenance difficulties. They have already realized this and are willing to unite and formulate an agreement, requesting the association's permission to jointly comply with it in order to maintain business development. Based on this, the association held a meeting and passed the revised agreement. Yesterday, it dispatched personnel to distribute notices to the city inside and outside the South Gate, and solicited unanimous participation from the industry to affix official store seals on the agreement to show credibility. Next, it will be promoted in Zhabei and the three concessions of England, France, and the United States. The articles of the agreement are excerpted as follows: (Article 1) This agreement is based on the general outline of the wholesale agreement formulated by this association, with the purpose of reorganizing the industry, unifying prices, and safeguarding the public welfare of the industry through voluntary unity. (Article 2) The publicly agreed price list will be distributed by the office, and all members of the industry must abide by it and not disrupt it. (Article 3) Those who agree to join the agreement should each pay a security deposit, divided into three grades: Grade A, three yuan; Grade B, two yuan; and Grade C, one yuan. The total amount will be deposited into a reputable bank and kept by four publicly elected persons. The office will issue a certificate, which can be used to pick up goods from tobacco companies and wholesalers. The aforementioned certificate must not be lent to others for use, otherwise it will be revoked. (Article 4) If a member who agrees to join the agreement violates the agreement, and it is reported secretly or found to be true after investigation, the security deposit paid by the store will be confiscated (the confiscated funds will be disposed of separately). For Grade C, after the first offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and another five yuan will be paid. For the second offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and another ten yuan will be paid. For the third offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and the certificate will be revoked. For Grade B, after the first offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and another ten yuan will be paid. For the second offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and another twenty yuan will be paid. For the third offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and the certificate will be revoked. For Grade A, after the first offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and another fifteen yuan will be paid. For the second offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and another thirty yuan will be paid. For the third offense, the security deposit will be confiscated and the certificate will be revoked. If, after the first offense, the second security deposit is not paid, the tobacco companies will be notified to cancel the industry's benefits, and for those without industry benefits, the certificate will be revoked and they will not be allowed to pick up goods from wholesalers. (Article 5) For those who have not joined the agreement, personnel will be sent to solicit their participation in the agreement. Those who withdraw halfway should request the tobacco company to stop supplying them with goods and the wholesaler to stop supplying them with goods. (Article 6) Newly opened stores must join the agreement and obtain a certificate from the office. Without a certificate from the office, they will not be allowed to pick up goods from tobacco companies and wholesalers. (Article 7) Members who join the agreement must be responsible for supervising each other. If there is any behavior that disrupts market prices, and it is reported or secretly reported and found to be true, the store's security deposit will be confiscated, and the reporter will be given a reward of three times the amount (the reward will be paid from the security deposit paid by the offending merchant). (Article 8) Members who join the agreement will be issued badges by the office and may go out at any time to investigate the prices of other members. Those being investigated must not refuse. (Article 9) If a member who joins the agreement uses gifts as a promotion or similar disguised gifts, it will be considered selling at a low price, and the store's security deposit will also be confiscated. (Article 10) If a member who joins the agreement sells at a low price while peddling outside, they will also be punished according to the agreement and the security deposit will be confiscated. (Article 11) The security deposits paid by members who join the agreement will be the responsibility of the elected custodians, deposited in a bank, and not allowed to be used for other purposes. (Article 12) If there are any matters not covered in this agreement, they may be decided by means of a meeting, but must be approved by more than half of the members present in this district.</p>

<p>The Water Disaster Entertainment Association in this city received a telegram from the magistrate of Hua County, Henan Province, and the Water Disaster Association yesterday, stating: "The people of Hua County are unfortunate, and floods are frequent. Fortunately, various charitable organizations in Shanghai have repeatedly provided relief, and the disaster-stricken people have been able to regenerate. However, the accumulated water has just receded, and the early drought has returned. This year, there was a drought for half a year, and the harvest of wheat was reduced. It was not until the beginning of July that the sweet rain began to fall, and the late autumn crops were barely sown. We were happy to see the lush green seedlings, and there was hope for the harvest. Unexpectedly, from the day of Wenri to Youri, it rained continuously, and the flat land was flooded. The germinated autumn crops all died in the water. In addition, accumulated water from Changyuan and Fengqiu counties all entered Hua County, and the Yellow River floods overflowed. Wan River houses and villages collapsed, villages were submerged, and people died. The city gates were surrounded by water on three sides. Yesterday, the provincial government dispatched a committee to the county to investigate the disaster. The county magistrate and others went out to survey, first riding horses and wading through the water, then taking boats, traveling back and forth for several days, traveling more than a hundred miles. Statistics show that more than 600 villages were flooded, of which more than 400 villages in the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts had been hit by the disaster three times. The tragic situation cannot be fully described in writing. We were suffering from a lack of avenues to appeal when we suddenly read in the newspaper that you gentlemen were promoting the kindness of rescuing the drowning, doing the good deed of helping the masses, and launching entertainment to help the disaster relief, universally saving all living beings on the earth. We admire your benevolence, and we are extremely grateful. Therefore, we have attached the disaster situation survey table of this county and photos of the tragic situation of the third-year water disaster, and we hope that you will inspect them and quickly provide rescue. The people of the entire county will be able to survive, and we will be extremely grateful." Signed, Xie Suian, Magistrate of Hua County, and the Water Disaster Association, respectfully. Attached: Disaster Survey Table (1) "Disaster area": The entire county has ten districts, and more than nine districts have been affected by the disaster, with a total area of more than fifty square miles. (2) "Number of deaths": The upper three villages of the East Qingcheng River have been washed away by the Yellow River flood, and there have been many deaths.

(5) "Number of submerged houses": More than 9,000 houses were washed away. (6) "Number of disaster-stricken households": A total of 681 villages, more than 50,000 households. (7) "Number of people awaiting relief": More than 280,000 people. (8) "Number of people displaced due to the disaster": Most of the county has been displaced due to the inconvenience of water, and many live in the open air on the land. (9) "Disaster period": Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been a drought, which has caused a disaster. Until the 7th, 8th, and 9th of July, the rain began to fall, and the autumn crops began to be sown. Suddenly, on the 12th, there was a heavy rainstorm, which did not stop day and night. From the 17th to the 25th, it rained continuously, and the land was flooded. Houses collapsed and crops were submerged. The villages near the dike were also washed away at this time. After receiving the telegram, in addition to replying to the county government, the association has yesterday transferred the original telegram and attached letter to the Relief Association, requesting a way to provide relief.</p>

After being instructed by Chief Judge Zhong, Deputy Police Chiefs Zhang and Chen, together with police detectives, successively arrested three people suspected of being involved: Zhu Fuqing, Qiao Liantang, and the woman Qiao Qishi. The interrogation was judged to have been suppressed for investigation. The details have been reported previously. It is now known that after continuous interrogation by Prosecutor Xie for several days, the day before yesterday, he ordered Zhu Fuqing and Qiao Liantang to be released on bail by reputable shopkeepers, while Qiao Qishi was detained awaiting thorough investigation. All the corpse's belongings, including a gold diamond ring, a set of thin gemstone hoops, a watch, and banknotes totaling 123 yuan, as well as small foreign coins, were transferred to Zhang Zhou yesterday after being instructed to come to court and receive them.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Chinese Police Officer Wang Yonghao Sues for Usury: Zhang Jingzhi Lived by Lending Money at High Interest; Excessive Oppression Led to Legal Action <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jingzhi, a Tianjin native residing at No. 30, Lane 345, Tangshan Road, has been engaged in the business of lending money at high interest rates, exploiting usury. There are not a few poor people who have been economically oppressed by him. Wang Yonghao, Chinese police officer No. 733 of the Huishan Police Station, once borrowed money from him, but because the interest was too high, he was still unable to repay it. Recently, Zhang sued him in the First Special District Court. Wang was angry at the excessive oppression and, citing the new criminal law's provisions for punishing usury, hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint against Zhang, requesting legal punishment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the criminal court of the First Special Court opened a court session to summon them. Since the implementation of the new criminal law, this is the second case of prosecuting usury. According to Wang Yonghao's complaint, he borrowed 20 yuan from Zhang in 1920, and Zhang demanded 4 yuan in interest per month. By the following year, according to Zhang's calculation, the principal and interest had reached 120 yuan. In addition, he still owed him 182 yuan in hui money (a type of rotating savings and credit association). However, by 1933, the two amounts had been combined, and together with interest, they had become 694 yuan. The money I repaid was the 15 yuan salary given to me each month by a certain rental agent, which the defendant collected. Up to now, I have repaid more than 400 yuan in succession, etc. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Jingzhi denied that the loan was a loan at a high interest rate, saying that the money owed by the defendant was all lent to him successively, and that the 694 yuan was all principal, with no hui money included, and even less interest on interest. The interest rate was also set at 2% per month, with a promissory note as proof. Because he had delayed in repaying, he had filed a lawsuit in the civil court, etc., and submitted 13 promissory notes. The plaintiff's attorney then stated that the civil court case had been suspended and should be handled after this case is resolved. Judge Huang ruled that since the plaintiff had presented witnesses, saying that he could prove the fact that the defendant was exploiting usury, he adjourned the hearing to investigate the evidence and question it again.</p>

<p>Rickshaw pullers in the Shanghai South and West areas, protesting the French Municipal Council's levy, went on strike on the morning of the 6th of this month. Later, over a thousand rickshaw pullers and representatives, holding flags, intended to petition the French Municipal Council Police Department and the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association. Around 9 AM, they arrived at the junction of the French and Chinese areas at Xiejiao, and a conflict broke out due to French Concession police officers preventing their passage. Three Vietnamese constables were beaten and injured. Upon receiving the alarm, the French police dispatched a large number of detectives to suppress the situation, arresting Xue Ruxu, Li Yuehua, Xu Xiaosi, and three others. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention, pending further questioning after the injured Vietnamese constables recovered. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Peng, appointed by the Second Special Court, visited the eighth criminal court and ordered the defendants to be brought in for further questioning. The police department's lawyer, Chen Ming, explained the results of the investigation, and filed a public prosecution based on Article 150 of the Criminal Law (disrupting order), Article 153 (obstructing official duties), and Article 277 (assault). The police also submitted as evidence the broken rifle carried by the Vietnamese constables, the damaged hats, the iron bars and stones used in the assault, and the flags with slogans. Furthermore, Witness No. 632, a Chinese constable, testified that the first defendant, Xue Ruxu, used a wooden stick to hit people. Witness No. 422, a Chinese constable, testified that the third defendant, Xu Xiaosi, held a flag and shouted slogans, and also beat a Vietnamese constable. Witness No. 29, a Western constable, testified that he saw two Chinese constables chasing the second defendant, Li Yuehua, so he helped to arrest Li. In court, all three defendants denied the acts of assault and beating of the Vietnamese constables. Xu Xiaosi even claimed that the flag he was holding was picked up from trash. At this point, Judge Sun stated that the police department's prosecution of the defendants for assault was a private prosecution, requiring the injured Vietnamese constables to appear in court for cross-examination before a verdict could be reached. Currently, the injured Vietnamese constables are receiving treatment in the hospital, and the case cannot proceed. Therefore, the hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 28th. The defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>Hua Azeng, the owner of the Huangdai Watermelon Company in Xiyuan, received two threatening letters from the "Communist Party Reconnaissance Team Captain Zhou Gengsheng" starting on the 10th of this month, attempting to extort 10,000 yuan. Hua reported the case to the police for investigation. The day before yesterday at 10:30 AM, Huisi Police Department detectives Shang Wu and Tao Genrong, and detective Wang Youshan, arrested two suspects, Wang Asheng from Shaoxing and Wang Zhixiang from Ningbo, at the Deyuelou Teahouse on North Xizang Road and took them into custody. Yesterday morning, they were prosecuted in the First Special Court under Article 346, Section 3 of the Criminal Law. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case, saying that Hua Azeng, in addition to operating the Huangdai Watermelon Company, also contracted tea stalls in the Yong'an and Xianshi amusement parks, with a good business, which attracted the attention of bandits. Around 2 PM on the 10th of this month, Hua received a threatening letter, signed by Zhou Gengsheng, the captain of the Communist Party Reconnaissance Team, demanding 10,000 yuan in "subsidy funds." If not granted, Hua's descendants would be killed, and reporting to the police was forbidden. Hua immediately reported the letter to the police. After a detailed investigation, the police learned that the letter was mailed from a mailbox on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. On August 16th, Hua received a second letter. Knowing it was a threatening letter, Hua refused to accept it and had the postman return it. The police have since retrieved the letter from the post office. The letter urged Hua to contact them quickly. Yesterday morning, detective Shang Wu learned that the bandits were hiding in the Deyuelou Teahouse on North Xizang Road, so he arrested the two defendants. Two receipts for mailing letters were found on Wang Asheng. Wang Zhixiang confessed to the police that he wrote the draft of the letter and instructed Wang Asheng to mail it, but the idea originated with a man named Li who is still at large. Li used to work for Hua Azeng and discussed the threatening wording in room 13 of the Dongxin Hotel, which Wang Zhixiang then wrote down. Because further investigation is needed, the police requested an extension. Judge Liu Yugui briefly questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be detained for further questioning in ten days.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Dong Zhenyi Throws Himself into the Huangpu River - Owes Over 1,000 Yuan to Indians - Drove to Desperation and Suicide <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>At 5 PM the day before yesterday, near the Dinghai Bridge in Yangshupu East, a middle-aged man in a Western suit was seen pacing on the Bund. At that time, a dredging ship from the Shanghai Dredging Bureau happened to be docked nearby. The foreman noticed the man's worried expression but did not pay much attention. In a flash, the man disappeared, leaving behind a white sun helmet and a brown serge jacket. Assuming he went ashore, the area was sparsely populated, and he would have been visible. Therefore, they suspected he had thrown himself into the river and died. They immediately sent the belongings to the Customs Water Police Station. Inside, the name "Dong Zhenyi" was written on the leather belt with a pen. Two business cards were found in the pocket, one from the Chengji Hospital in Gaochangqiao and one from Shi Ruihua of the Xinghua Printing Bureau in Hongdeli, Xiamen Road. The police, with leads to follow, immediately dispatched detective Yao Guofa to investigate. They learned that the deceased was indeed named Dong Zhenyi, 30 years old, from Changzhou, living in a house without a number on Pingliang Road, Xiajiabang. Dong had worked as a director in a department of the Shenxin No. 6 Factory, proficient in writing. After losing his job, he was now selling medicines for Chengji Hospital. His wife had passed away, and he remarried a woman named Li last year, and they were deeply in love. According to Li, her husband was very concerned with appearances. Even though his monthly income was very small after leaving the Shenxin Factory, he still took a private rickshaw every day, and his clothing was no less than before, causing increasing financial difficulties. He owed over 1,000 yuan to Indians and other creditors. On the 16th of this month, he gave her one yuan, asking her to use it for several days of living expenses. He said he was going out to find work, but he had not returned for several nights and must have committed suicide. She was heartbroken. The detective, having clarified the matter, returned to the police station to report, in order to recover the body.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Jin Yu Securities Firm Embezzlement of Treasury Bonds Case Closed Yesterday - Gan Denglai Resort to Embezzlement After Public Debt Investment Failed - Wei Yuansheng Was Implicated by a Friend, Lawyer Delivered Eloquent Speech <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Gan Denglai of Yuyao, an employee of the Jin Yu Securities Firm on Qingyuan Lane, Beijing Road, privately traded public debt using fabricated accounts, incurring losses of over ten thousand yuan. Fearing to suffer the same fate as his colleague, surnamed Pan, who was reported to the police by the firm's manager, Gan Yunqiao, for corruption, he sought help from Wei Tingrong's son, Yuansheng, but was refused. He then took advantage of the gap before the end of July's settlement to steal a large amount of treasury bonds bearing the firm's stamp. Upon being arrested, he implicated Wei Yuansheng out of resentment for ruining his plans. Yuansheng was implicated and surrendered for questioning last Friday. Details were reported in the previous issue. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court continued the hearing.</p>
<p>First, the police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated that on the 18th of this month, a Yang, the leader of the Yuyao Security Team, reported to the police that he had received a letter from Gan Denglai's cousin, Wang Xinquan, saying that Gan had entrusted him to bring back 5,000 yuan in treasury bonds and 2,300 yuan in cash to his hometown. On the way, he was swindled out of 1,200 yuan, and spent 40 yuan in expenses, leaving 1,060 yuan. He was instructed to bury the remaining money and treasury bonds under a certain pagoda. The team leader rushed to the address and found 760 yuan in cash and 4,000 yuan in treasury bonds. Wang Xinquan was nowhere to be found. The court then questioned the defendant, Gan Denglai, who confessed that due to public debt trading, he had incurred huge losses. He had asked Wei Yuansheng for help, but Wei had refused. On the 29th, he went to Wei's house to ask for a few days of lodging. Later, Wei Yuansheng, seeing the advertisement posted by Gan Yunqiao to apprehend him, urged him to surrender to the police quickly. Regarding the private trading of public debt at Jin Yu, he fabricated five accounts, three of which were real people, and he only borrowed their names for public debt transactions. The other two accounts, Xian Ji and Nian Ji, were entirely fabricated. Seeing that his colleague Pan Quan Zhong was reported to the police by the manager for corruption, he thought he also had corrupt practices, fearing that he would be treated the same as Pan, he seized the opportunity to steal the bonds and escape.</p>
<p>Wei Yuansheng testified that when Qian came to his house on July 27th, he only said that he would be going to his hometown and asked to stay for a few days. Unable to refuse, he agreed. On the 29th, he brought a leather suitcase and lived on the third floor of his house, not knowing that the case contained treasury bonds. Later, seeing the newspaper, he forced him to surrender to the police and hired a car, instructing the driver to take him to the police station. Before leaving, Qian wanted to take all his cash, but I feared that he would take the money and escape, so I withheld the money. Later, the detectives came to my house to investigate the stolen treasury bonds and found 25,000 yuan in the Qian's bedroom, which was handed over to the detectives. The next morning, they continued to search the room and found 20,000 yuan in treasury bonds under the mat, which was also handed over to the police. Because the facts were clear, the court ordered the debate to begin. First, the police stated that the defendant, Gan Denglai, had originally worked at Jin Yu. He had been fired last year and re-employed this spring at the request of others. He continued to fabricate names, privately print orders, and forge seals, committing fraud as before. Seeing that the case of his colleague, Pan, was exposed, fearing that he would suffer the same fate as Pan, he seized the opportunity to steal the bonds and escape. His escape can be said to be influenced by Pan. The fact that he withdrew his money from the Agricultural and Industrial Bank showed that he had planned in advance. The implication of Wei Yuansheng was purely due to Qian's confession. However, Qian has now admitted that his surrender was advocated by Wei. Therefore, the degree of suspicion borne by Wei has been greatly reduced, and it should be judged according to law. Next, Wu Linkun, the lawyer representing Jin Yu, stated the object of the private prosecution against Gan Denglai: (1) 1,000 yuan in treasury bonds; (2) 1,540 yuan in cash; (3) Qian fabricated client's private trading of public debt owing 2,832 yuan and 85 cents. Finally, lawyer Jiang Yiping defended Wei Yuansheng, saying that Wei was unfortunately falsely accused by Qian, resulting in his being in the position of a defendant. Viewing the allegations involving Wei in Gan's confession, there are many contradictions, making them difficult to believe. For example, Qian said that on the 27th, he told Wei that he would collect the public debt from the bank on the 29th. The manager of the firm would never tell Qian about the collection of public debt two days in advance. If he did not know, how could he tell Wei? This is the first point. Gan also confessed that he gave the treasury bonds to Wei when he arrived at Wei's house. Qian's theft of the bonds was due to failed speculation, incurring huge losses. Why would Qian, even at the risk of breaking the law, easily give the illegally obtained property to others? Qian is not so foolish, he would never do this. This is the second point. Supposing Wei knew about Qian's illegal behavior and was willing to help, he would never urge him to surrender to the police, but let him escape. And Wei could have hoarded the treasury bonds. Instead, Wei not only urged Qian to surrender, but also hired a car to take him to the police station. At the same time, he intercepted the cash that Qian wanted to take away. Because Qian wanted to escape but could not, his entire plan was ruined by Wei. He hated Wei very much, so he falsely accused Wei of conspiracy to the police. This is the third point. As for Wei's allowing Qian to stay temporarily, it was a normal act of friendship and it was not proper to question him in advance. Upon seeing the newspaper report, he resolutely gave the plaintiff various assistance, so as to minimize the illegal damage. Wei's attitude is bright and his actions are upright. Not only is he innocent, but he is also meritorious. Now, he is involved in a public prosecution. For the sake of justice, Wei Yuansheng should be declared innocent, so that those who support justice in the world will not be discouraged. This was a powerful and eloquent defense, quite moving to the court. After the opening of the court, the judge ordered Gan Denglai to be detained and Wei Yuansheng to remain on bail from the original shop, pending sentencing next Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ye Zhongfang, from Ningbo, nicknamed "Little Tremor," was ordered by the Second Special Court to be detained and forcibly executed after his wife, Lu Yinglan, sued for divorce, and the judgment ordered him to pay 60,000 yuan in alimony. Ye resisted and did not appear in court. At the same time, Shuntaixiang Western Clothing Store on Avenue Joffre was owed 1,416 yuan and 3 jiao for materials, and after suing in the Wuxian Court, the judgment was made to repay the debt. Upon hearing the news, lawyer Lin Jieqing was also entrusted to participate in the case and requested enforcement. Since Ye was detained without bail, the creditors requested that the movable property inside No. 22, Lane 169, Carter Road, where Ye lived, be sealed and impounded. The court approved the request and sent a letter to the First Special Court to send someone to seal Ye's residence on Carter Road. After Ye's detention, the house was immediately vacated, making it impossible to impound it. Yesterday, Judge Yang Ding of the Enforcement Division of the Second Special Court held a hearing to question Ye. Ye said that he really had no means to deal with it and could not find bail. He has been in detention for nearly two months. The plaintiff has not been able to find any other property. He asked to be released. Moreover, his mother is seriously ill, and he asked to be allowed to go out and visit his mother. The official said that you must find a guarantor before you can go out, otherwise you cannot. Later, Ye's lawyer, Ma Nangeng, made a request on his behalf. The court ruled that he could send someone to accompany Ye out today to quickly find a guarantor, and temporarily return him to detention. However, since Ye's detention, he has quit his habits, his complexion is whiter than before, and his spirit is also good. His concubine, Lu Xiaomei, goes to the detention center every morning to visit and send food. Ye spends his days in detention working on short essays, and the comedy playwright Yi Fangshuo is detained in the next cell, and the two can polish comedy plays through the wall. Therefore, Ye is not lonely in detention, and his expression is cheerful and his movements are free, but he is only forbidden to go downstairs and talk loudly.</p>

<p>The old factory of the Zhonghua Book Company on Jing'an Temple Road was completed twenty years ago, and is not very suitable in the current era. Therefore, the old factory was sold and a new factory was built on Gordon Road and Macao Road, with five four-story buildings, about three million cubic feet. Its characteristics are four: (1) All steel and concrete construction, extremely sturdy, load-bearing, and fireproof, all very suitable. (2) Each room uses steel windows, the area of the windows accounting for two-thirds of the walls, sufficient light and air. (3) The factory uses a "川" shape, with the offices built horizontally on top of the "川" shape, the printing plant on the lower floor, the general office on the second floor, the editorial office on the third floor, and the library and testing room on the fourth floor. The entrances and exits are very economical. The general manager can gather the cadres and staff in one minute, and can gather the heads of the various departments in three minutes. Other work connections are also very time-saving. (4) The printing capacity is increased, and the efficiency is increased. Daily letterpress can print 10 million pages of books, color printing can print more than one million New Year's prints of various sizes, and intaglio printing can print more than one million banknotes. In addition, various printing techniques, such as photogravure, photographic plate, electroplating plate, carved relief plate, and Western typesetting, are all the most sophisticated and up-to-date. The relocation is scheduled to begin next month, and new machines will be installed, but work will not be stopped. The entire move is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Whether in terms of architecture or output, it is almost the only printing factory in China.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Flood Relief Entertainment Fair Hearing Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since its opening, the flood relief entertainment fair in all circles of the city has been crowded with guests. Although it has been intermittently sunny and rainy for several days, the grand occasion has not diminished. Yesterday was the sixth day after the opening. Peking Opera was performed by all the amateur actors of the Zhengyi Society's Box Office, and the performance was very exciting. The group singing of "Qunfang" was also deeply appreciated by the guests. The president of the fair, Wang Xiaolai, and the chairman, Lin Kanghou, believed that because the disaster area was too wide, the funds raised in the future would not be distributed without a leading body for overall planning. Therefore, it was decided that after the funds were collected, they would be turned over to the city's flood relief associations to distribute them to various places. The fair also received a telegram from the magistrate of Huaxian County yesterday asking for relief. The original telegram was sent to the relief association for processing. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Relief Association</p>
<p>To the esteemed: Since the beginning of this summer, continuous rain has been rampant, mountain floods have erupted, the Yangtze River has overflowed first, and the Yellow River has breached its dikes afterwards. The disaster area is wide, and the disaster is heavier than in the past. We, as fellow citizens, cannot but feel grief for this great disaster and calamity. Therefore, we have boldly initiated a flood relief entertainment fair, incorporating charity into entertainment, and raising funds through entertainment. In the future, all surplus funds will be handed over to your association for distribution to the disaster areas to help the victims. We know that a cup of water or a cart of firewood cannot solve the problem, but accumulating bits and pieces and gathering sand into a tower may provide some help to the victims. Now that our fair has just opened, we plan to invite members of your association to be stationed here to provide guidance, so that we can follow your lead to benefit the disaster and revitalize affairs. We are truly grateful to the public.</p>
<p>Today's Entertainment</p>

<p>Around 8 AM on the 11th of this month, two rogue Russians, Konstantin Dinashav and Airahanqin, went to the home of Englishman Tom Boson at No. 810 Avenue Lafayette in the French Concession to take out 600 yuan in ten-yuan banknotes from the Tianjin Local Bank, offering to sell them for 200 yuan. Tom Boson realized that the Tianjin Local Bank had been closed for a long time, and they were using this counterfeit money with the intention of fraud, so he secretly reported it to the French police. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest the two Russians and took them to the police station along with the counterfeit money. During interrogation, Dinashav dared to grab the head of Western inspector Gan Xiu, and fortunately Gan struggled and managed to escape. Airahanqin even kicked Russian detective Loknaski in the leg, causing injury, and dared to break the arm of a Chinese constable. After being imprisoned in the detention center, they continued to make noise. The next day, the police sent the two defendants to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, prosecuting them for using counterfeit money and obstructing official duties. During the interrogation by Judge Li Changnian, the defendants tore their clothes in court, saying that they had been beaten by undercover detectives in the police station and had water poured into their mouths and noses, causing injuries. They requested an examination and said that they did not want to be returned to the police station, otherwise they would go on a hunger strike and die. The court ordered the defendants to be transferred to the detention center pending investigation and further hearing. During the investigation, it was found that the defendants had also committed crimes in Harbin and Tianjin. The police sent letters to investigate. Yesterday morning at 11 AM, Judge Li of the Second Special Court continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. The police lawyer said that because the investigation of the case was not concluded, he requested another adjournment. The judge questioned the Western detective in charge of the case whether he had sent official letters to Harbin, Tianjin, etc. for investigation. The detective replied that the letters were sent by the police station and had not yet received a reply. At this time, the defense lawyer hired by the defendants requested the court to have the injuries on the defendants photographed and filed for record. The judge said that this could be requested from the police department and announced that the case would be re-heard on the 23rd in a special court. The defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>Cai Jinjun, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued a notice to rectify the city's appearance, strictly prohibiting going topless. Recently, at the dyeing workshop opened by Wu Wenhai at No. 92 Jinjia Road, the workshop staff, Chuan Decheng, Yang Peifa, and Wu Wangshi, were all standing naked at the door to cool off. Ms. Wu was also wearing a short vest, which was very detrimental to the city's appearance. Guard Liu Fangqiu of No. 34 persuaded them to put on clothes five times, but Chuan and the others turned a deaf ear. Last night at 8 PM, Chuan and others were standing naked on the street again. When Officer Liu went forward to stop them, not only did they not listen, but they also spoke rudely. Just as he was about to go to the station to ask for punishment, five or six people suddenly rushed out of the workshop, surrounded Officer Liu, and beat him. Officer Liu's white uniform was torn, and his wrist was broken, bleeding profusely. With the help of the neighboring guards, Chuan Decheng, Yang Peifa, and Wu Wangshi were taken to the station. After questioning by Director Liu, the defendants were found to have refused to listen to the ban on going topless, and relying on their numbers, they dared to commit outrageous acts, assaulting the police officer and tearing his uniform, which was extremely bold and reckless. It was ruled to be sent to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>In the Chenjiazhai area of Beitouziguo, in the Luxing District of Pudong, there is a small river where Mr. Chen of Chenjiazhai has traditionally raised fish and shrimp. Recently, he has suffered repeated losses due to unscrupulous individuals who secretly set nets at night to steal them, causing him great distress. Therefore, filled with hatred, he and his clansmen kept watch around the area for several nights, aiming to catch the thieves. On the night of the sixteenth of this month, around midnight, they spotted a thief, about thirty years old, wearing a blue short-sleeved shirt and trousers, carrying fish, fishing nets, and bamboo poles on his shoulder, secretly setting nets in the river shallows to catch fish. Mr. Chen and his men spotted him and, unwilling to let him go easily, rushed forward with axes. Without asking any questions, they struck the thief's head with more than ten axe blows, killing him instantly. Seeing the magnitude of the disaster they had caused, they scattered and fled. Afterward, the local bailiff reported the incident to the local court, which sent officials to investigate, place the body in a coffin, and order the arrest of the perpetrators. It is now learned that the Donggou Police Station of the responsible Public Security Bureau is paying exceptional attention to this case. Due to the extremely cruel methods of the perpetrator, the police secretly ordered senior officers to search for the culprits. The two suspects, Chen Fusheng and Chen Tianming, were taken into custody a few days ago, and their interrogation yielded evasive answers. Yesterday, on orders, an official document was prepared and police were dispatched to escort Chen Fusheng and Chen Tianming to the Public Security Bureau for transfer to the local court for further investigation. Subsequently, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying submitted a proposal, and after lengthy separate interrogations, he ordered them to be detained separately pending investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Series of Crimes in Shanghai Committed by a Bandit Resolved in Baoying <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Jiangbei bandit Dong Changfu, who had previously committed numerous crimes in the Shanghai International Settlement and evaded justice by fleeing to other areas, was recently apprehended by the Public Security Bureau of Baoying County. Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective of the Jiading Road Precinct, and Ye Yusi, an investigator, learned of this. A few days ago, they presented a notice from the First Special District Court and rushed to the Baoying County government to bring back the bandit Dong. Yesterday, he was brought to the Third Criminal Court. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that between the nineteenth and twentieth years of the Republic, the defendant, along with others already apprehended, including Da Ming, armed and robbed ten households, including Tu Ruiqing at 1080 Wuzhou Road, Zhuang Yuanda at Yard Road, Hong Youming at 282 Yuezhou Road, Hou Chunfu at 444 Huishan Road, Qian at 668 Zhoujiazui Road, and Xie Er at 1805 Tangshan Tou, of valuables worth over four thousand yuan. He requested an adjournment to summon the victims to testify in court. Judge Jiang Shuzi briefly questioned the defendant, then ordered him to be returned to custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Wan Mu Ai Hua Wei Qu Xisai (transliteration), a 38-year-old Russian employee of the World Detective Protection Office located in Room 310, No. 2 Beijing Road, was addicted to gambling. Recently, he embezzled a significant amount of public funds from the office for gambling debts, which he could not repay. In a fit of resentment, he conceived the idea of ending his life. Yesterday morning around nine o'clock, while no one was around, he used his own pistol to shoot himself in the head inside the office. He collapsed in a pool of blood. The office's chief supervisor, an Englishman named Ge Like, returned from outside and discovered the body. He immediately reported the incident to the Central Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. The detectives transported the Russian to Gongji Hospital, but resuscitation attempts failed, and he soon died. The detectives also found three suicide notes near his body, stating that he was driven to suicide by financial difficulties. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei was appointed by the First Special District Court to conduct an autopsy. After Head Constable Lu Dagong and others explained the situation, and Ge Like testified that the deceased was his assistant and that he was not present when the suicide occurred. "Upon my return, a Western woman told me that she had heard a gunshot from within my writing room. I intended to go inside to investigate but found that the door had been locked from the inside by the deceased. I broke the glass in a small window next to the door and managed to open the door, finding the deceased collapsed between two chairs with a lot of blood flowing from his head, and the pistol lying beside his body on the right side. I then notified the police station. As for the funds he used, I am unable to determine the amount at this time as he was in charge of the accounting books, etc.," Ge Like said. The deceased's wife, He Ai Tuo, also testified. Prosecutor Guo Wei concluded that the deceased, Russian man Wan Mu Ai Hua Wei Qu Xisai, male, died from a gunshot wound to the head sustained during his lifetime. The body was released to Ge Like for preparation for burial with a signed guarantee.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Women's Production Cooperative, affiliated with the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, has been actively progressing with two departments: a women's cooperative store and a vocational training class. Recently, for the sake of convenience, the vocational training class has merged with the "Chinese Women's Domestic Arts Vocational School" established by the Qijia Department of the association. Enrollment has been extremely enthusiastic in recent days. As the school is vocational in nature, in addition to theoretical instruction in the morning, the courses focus on practical training. A formal women's cooperative store will be established for the practice of crafts students, and a cafeteria and nursery will be prepared for the practice of nutrition and infant care students. The association has decided to dedicate a section of the building with a street-facing facade for a formal opening in a short period.

<h3 id="e146">New Gospel for Tuberculosis Patients <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao has been researching lung diseases for decades and has recently discovered a medicinal herb that is proven to have therapeutic effects on lung diseases. It has already been taken by many lung disease patients with excellent results. This medicinal herb is named Mi Gen. Its efficacy lies in promoting metabolic processes in the body, fully eliminating waste products, and allowing tuberculosis toxins to be discharged through urine. Its greatest effect is improving blood circulation, which is essential because circulating blood contains immune substances that combat tuberculosis bacteria. Improved circulation allows a greater flow of these substances to the lungs, like sending more soldiers to the front lines to resist lung disease, thereby strengthening the encirclement and suppression of the bacteria. Furthermore, weakened lung tissue due to lung disease benefits from improved blood circulation, receiving a greater supply of blood for nourishment. The more blood that circulates, the more nutrition is replenished to the lung tissue deprived by the tuberculosis bacteria. This is like providing abundant supplies from the supply depot to the anti-tuberculosis front lines in the lung tissue, sustaining its resistance and achieving ultimate victory. This is the real reason why this herb, by improving blood circulation, can cure lung disease. In addition, it is also effective for all chronic diseases.</p>

<p>— (Wan Lu)</p>
<p>Everything has a prominent side and a dark side. Ordinary people only see the prominent side and do not study its dark side. Smart people see the prominent side while also exploring the dark side. There is another type of person who is the opposite of ordinary people, only seeing the dark side and ignoring the prominent side. The views of ordinary people are naturally too shallow, but focusing only on the dark side is also too disappointing. Only those who see both sides will not be fooled, nor will they be disappointed. Take Shanghai for example, simply admiring the brilliance of neon lights is not recognizing Shanghai. Exclusively studying how many stores have closed on Nanjing Road and how many suicides are reported in the newspaper every day is also not the correct way to understand Shanghai. Therefore, you must see both sides to be considered smart and to truly understand Shanghai.</p>
<p>The best things in the world have a bit of confusion in them, making them more interesting. If you see everything through, there is no fun at all. For example, when you are in the midst of sweet affection, suddenly the image of a decaying skeleton pops into your head, sending a chill down your spine and instantly scattering all the tenderness to the clouds. Or, if you are calculating when a sum of money is due, or when a property should be settled, with your mind filled with colorful banknotes, you suddenly think about the impermanence of life, when everything comes to an end, and your whole spirit sinks to the lowest point. Therefore, it is said: a bit of confusion brings a bit of happiness; more intelligence brings more torment.</p>
<h3 id="e160">From Flood Control to Afforestation <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Foying from Tokyo</p>
<p>Domestic newspapers report that a foreign water conservancy expert said that China's recent flood control methods, which focus on dikes, are not a good strategy. In the future, more attention should be paid to dredging. This is certainly true, but dredging is still a temporary solution. The fundamental method of flood control is afforestation because trees can conserve water and regulate climate. This is a very simple principle and need not be explained further.</p>
<p>On this trip to Japan, I paid special attention to their forestry policies. I visited several forest farms and even climbed several mountains in Hokkaido. I collected many plans, reports, and forms from the Hokkaido Prefectural Government and the Colonial Department in Sapporo. After careful study, I realized that it is a big mistake for China to imitate Japan's current forestry facilities completely. Their area is small, funding is sufficient, talent is abundant, and they already have considerable achievements. Now they are naturally only conducting trials, research, and improvement work. However, in China, the situation is exactly the opposite. The government leaves millions of barren hills unplanted and only learns from them how to run trial farms. Regardless of the success or failure of these farms, even if you discover after ten or twenty years how much water a certain type of tree absorbs and how much it evaporates, perhaps a flood has already sent your trial farm to a watery grave. When you are hungry, you should fill your stomach with large pancakes and fried dough sticks first. It is okay to study the manufacturing methods of sponge cake later.</p>
<p>My point is that the government only needs to make a decision, roughly formulate an implementation outline, (just roughly, because seeking precision will inevitably lead to disputes, and in fact, cold-climate tree species do not necessarily die when brought to warm climates). For example, it should specify which types of trees should be planted in certain areas, issue orders nationwide, and set up a nursery in each designated area. One or two years later, when the seedlings are cultivated, a nationwide mobilization should be launched, requiring each person to plant a certain number of trees, with heavy penalties for those who violate the rules. Even if each person only plants ten trees, with four hundred million people, there would be four billion trees. If each tree occupies one square zhang, there would be over six hundred million mu of land, and the required funding is actually minimal. Frankly speaking, everyone knows how to plant trees. It does not require skilled techniques like operating machinery, nor does it require precise management like growing vegetables. As long as you plant them and do not pull them up, they will grow on their own. If China has large forest farms of over six hundred million mu, the disasters of floods and droughts will be reduced by at least half in twenty years. I can guarantee this based on scientific principles. As for the forest experts for trial research, we will naturally need to rely on them in the future, but you need to have hair before you can use a comb.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Dajiao (Taoist Ritual) <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Bokuang</p>
<p>Although efforts are being made to reform various useless things in society, the public's superstitious belief in divine power remains firmly entrenched, posing a major obstacle to social reformers!</p>
<p>It is not easy to achieve rapid results in promoting changes in customs. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau and Social Affairs Bureau have been working hard to eliminate superstition for many years, but in the middle of July, the atmosphere of Dajiao rituals at the entrances of various alleys is still rampant, both in the east and in the west. It is truly helpless! It is a great pity to waste so much useful money in the ethereal realm.</p>
<p>The amount of money wasted in Shanghai alone is considerable. The total amount of money wasted on superstition nationwide is staggering. This year, they are reiterating the ban, earnestly persuading the public not to engage in these useless activities, hoping that this trend can be slightly reduced. In various towns and villages outside of Shanghai, during this ghost month of July, the sounds of drums and cymbals and the smoke of incense can be seen everywhere. Even larger amounts of paper money are burned, supposedly to help homeless ghosts and prevent them from haunting people, and to ensure the safety of the population. This is truly absurdly ridiculous.</p>
<p>Last year, there was a severe drought; this year, there is a major flood, leaving disaster victims stranded and with nowhere to go. Closing my eyes and thinking, I feel that so many disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. Now everyone should be frugal and save money to help the disaster victims. Wouldn't it be more virtuous to use the money spent on Dajiao nationwide for disaster relief? I am willing to speak out for the disaster victims and hope that everyone will stand up and promote this!</p>
<h3 id="e162">Questions and Answers on the Flood <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— (Ning Ziqiang)</p>
<p>Zilu asked Confucius, "How is the water situation this year?" Confucius said, "The overflowing waters are everywhere under the heavens."</p>
<p>Zilu then asked, "Is such a great flood beneficial to farming?" Confucius said, "Water! Water! (Disaster!) What good can be derived from water?"</p>

<p>Zilu asked again, "Since the flood is receding so quickly, are the seedlings unharmed?" Confucius said, "There are those that sprout but do not flower, and those that flower but bear no fruit!"</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Rotating Cylinder in Front of Barber Shops <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Aibo</p>
<p>When we usually pass by a barber shop, don't we see a three-colored cylinder rotating there non-stop? This three-colored cylinder is the unique symbol of a barber shop, and everyone knows it. However, to delve into its origins, I'm afraid many people don't quite understand.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I went to a used bookstore for a chat and inadvertently saw a book called "Observations on Travel in America," written by Mr. Wang Yizhi. At the beginning of the book, there were photos and prefaces by Mr. Shi Liangcai, the former general manager of this newspaper, and Mr. Chen Leng, which aroused my curiosity, so I opened it to take a look. On page 134 of this book, Mr. Wang discussed this matter, and his explanation is as follows:</p>
<p>"The constantly rotating cylinder in front of barber shops is painted around with what looks like red, white, and black stripes, spiraling upwards. Once it is set in motion by electricity, it is most eye-catching. This custom was introduced from Europe. In ancient Europe, barbers often also served as surgeons. The reason why this constantly rotating cylinder has red, white, and black stripes is that in ancient times, doctors used various colored cloths for binding wounds, which were often torn into very thin strips. You can get a glimpse of this in the bandages used in hospitals today."</p>
<p>The above is what Mr. Wang Yizhi said, which seems very detailed. I wonder if there are any other explanations. This is to ask the readers for guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Little Western Paradise <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Mo Wen's Daughter Has Unspeakable Pain, Everyone Eagerly Looks at the Dignitary, Admiring His Noble Demeanor</p>
<p>However, standing next to him was a woman, only in her thirties, with a perm, wearing high heels, and a tight cheongsam that stretched smoothly over the instep of her feet, very fashionable. Everyone couldn't help but feel disappointed when they saw this, never expecting that the grand welcome was just to welcome such a gentleman. However, Zhang Jiefu's psychology was the opposite of ordinary people's. He was even more enthusiastic. From afar, he saw the special commissioner's car arriving, his face beaming with red, and he took off his hat, standing by the gate, with his hands hanging straight down. Seeing that Special Commissioner Lan was about to reach the gate, he didn't dare to be negligent and immediately rushed forward, facing him directly, and bowing deeply three times. The special commissioner was a little surprised to suddenly see someone rushing forward to salute, but he guessed that it was probably a local welcoming representative, and definitely not someone trying to intercept him to file a complaint. Therefore, in his busy schedule, he stood still and nodded twice in succession. Jiefu saw him stop and nod twice, and his heart blossomed. He bent over, smiling, and took out a business card from his pocket, holding it up and handing it over. Special Commissioner Lan took it and looked at it. It was an unfamiliar name, and there was no official title. He didn't know which department it was from, so he just said "Oh" and nodded, saying, "Let's talk in detail later." Jiefu said "Yes, yes" twice, and stepped back two steps. Special Commissioner Lan accompanied his wife and walked into Little Western Paradise, and Jiefu also followed inside. This time, it felt like the bones in his body immediately gained several pounds, and he walked with very steady steps. He looked at the people watching the excitement on both sides, and his chest puffed out, as if hinting to people, "Look, I'm walking with the special commissioner." Especially when he walked into Little Western Paradise and saw a group of acquaintances, he couldn't stop smiling from the corners of his mouth. The meaning was again, "My welcoming Special Commissioner Lan is not accidental, right?" Because of this, others indeed believed that he was a relative of Special Commissioner Lan. (296)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"After the flower juice is made, we use newly spun silk from that year (of course, undyed white silk)," she said again, "We press it into square shapes like mooncakes; their size is determined by the diameter of my rouge container, so they fit perfectly. These square pieces of silk floss must be soaked in the flower juice for at least five or six days to be completely saturated; once they are saturated, we take them out one by one and put them in the sunlight to dry. After about three or four days of drying, when they are completely dry, we can send them in for us to use. The effort involved is quite a lot when you calculate it carefully, but fortunately, we don't waste it too much. Each time we make it, it's enough for five or six months!"</p>
<p>How did the Empress Dowager apply rouge?</p>
<p>She first soaked a small square of red silk floss in a cup of warm water, then took it out and gently rubbed it in the palms of her hands until she felt satisfied. Because women in the past always applied a lot of red to the palms of their hands, the Empress Dowager's first step was to apply it to her palms. After applying it to her palms, she applied it to her cheeks. At this time, she didn't have time to talk to me anymore. She brought her face very close to the mirror and applied it with extreme care, hoping that it wouldn't be too thick or too uneven, just right. The last step was to apply it to her lips; however, people in the past definitely didn't apply lipstick to the entire upper and lower lips like people do now. They only applied a little rouge to the middle of the lips, probably influenced by the phrase "cherry mouth" used by scholars. (396)</p>

<h3 id="e166">Tan Biscuits <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Jiqun</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was socializing at a relative's house, and during the meal, a Mr. Wang who works in the food industry chatted with me. He said: "Business is really difficult to do now. Customers are becoming more and more discerning, and costs are increasing year by year. No matter what product it is, whether it's produced by our food company, invented by ourselves, copied from Western production, or a famous specialty from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, nowadays, not to mention competitors trying to grab business, even those who specialize in wholesale or selling imported goods, once they hear that a certain business is profitable, they will copy each other. On the customer's side, there is competition between companies, so they compare and naturally the superior wins and the inferior is eliminated, and everyone goes to the better company. However, if we put ourselves in the position of doing this business, then we will have to cry in pain. At the moment, not to mention anything else, just take the biscuit business in Shanghai as an example. Biscuits are also a 'big deal' in the food industry. Small capital can't do it well. In the past, apart from the imported goods in tins, there are two foreign companies in Shanghai that have factories here, such as 'Sullivan,' etc. On the domestic side, there are 'Mashen,' 'Taifeng,' 'Taikang,' 'Guanshengyuan,' etc., which are relatively large in scope, produce a lot, and their sales are not bad. Speaking of Guanshengyuan, we now know that more than ten years ago, it was still a small shop in Nine Acres, specializing in preserved tangerine peel and concentrated beef juice. Who knew that in less than twenty years, it has grown from one store to several, from Shanghai to Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Hankou, Beijing, Tianjin, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, with no less than ten branches, distributing to more than a hundred places. The business is booming, and the capital has increased to 500,000 yuan. Their factory has always been on Jumen Road in South Shanghai. General Manager Xian Guansheng is hardworking and frugal, and has been like this for decades. No matter what the matter, or even a small product, he must personally try it and personally study it. For the sake of improving the quality of candies and biscuits, he and Wang Changyuan, the director of the biscuit department in the factory, have even gone to the Three Islands several times for inspection. Realizing that the factory base was insufficient and that the efficiency of manual labor was far inferior to that of mechanized production, he bought more than forty acres of land in Caohejing two years ago, half of which was used as a farm, and half of which was used to build a five-story steel and concrete mansion. He also ordered the latest and most economical machine from France. After a long period of planning and operation, it has now been successfully completed. Factory supervisor Zhao Zemin and Mr. Xian go to Caohejing every day. At the moment, the biscuit department has been moved from the old factory, the machines have been installed, and several specialized technicians have been hired to start the machines, and the products are excellent. According to the responsible talk of Mr. Wang Changyuan, for example, originally one ton of coal was used every day, and only 1,000 pounds of biscuits were baked. Now, since the new machine has been tested, it's too cheap. One ton of coal can be used for three or four days, and the fine biscuits produced are thoroughly baked, quickly made, have heavy ingredients, and taste good, with five times more products than before, while the coal consumption is reduced by 60-70%, and labor is also saved, so the cost is relatively low. In terms of products, there are no less than twenty or thirty kinds, such as morning tea, milk, sandwich, soda, etc. Their pricing is based on the principle of small profits and quick turnover. The raw materials are increasing step by step, and the taste is moderate and balanced. Although they cannot boast of being unique, they regard imported products as a strong enemy.</p>
<p>Aren't we hearing about the economic downturn all around us? Who knew that in this trend, there would be such a Guanshengyuan biscuit factory expanding and developing, which is worthy of promotion and introduction. In this way, we hope that their products will continue to move forward, and then the achievement of their future is immeasurable, and we hope that other domestic manufacturers can follow their example of hard work, focusing on their own efforts, without making unfounded exaggerations, then Mr. Sun Yat-sen's "People's Livelihood" doctrine will not be difficult to realize.</p>
<p>After Mr. Wang finished speaking, I was happy to write it down.</p>

<h3 id="e167">The Problem of Co-educational Schools in Peiping is Completely Solved. The Original Female Students of Each School Will Be Graduated Yearly. No Female Students Will Be Enrolled in the First Grade This Year. <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) The problem of abolishing private co-educational schools in Peiping has taken a sharp turn after mediation from various parties in recent days. Both parties have agreed on a general outline for resolution. The Private Middle School Federation held a general membership meeting at 11:00 AM on the 19th at the Senlong Western Restaurant in the Dong'an Market to discuss detailed solutions in order to make a final decision. Representatives from 52 schools were present at the meeting. After lunch, the five executive committee members who had visited the authorities reported on the agreed outline, which was then discussed. The entire body unanimously passed the proposal. After the meeting, all members of the federation took cars to visit Yuan Liang at the Municipal Government. After some discussion and explanation, three solutions were decided: (1) The original female students of the co-educational schools will continue their studies at their original schools and graduate yearly; (2) The first grade of junior high school and the first grade of senior high school in each school this year will not be allowed to enroll female students. The names of the female students who have already been enrolled will be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau, which will find ways to place them in other public and private girls' middle schools in Peiping; (3) The Private Middle School Federation will draft a formal document and submit it to the authorities. After approval, it will be implemented. The members of the Private Middle School Federation left the Municipal Government at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Placing Female Students</p>
<p>The private Kongde Middle School is also co-educational, and the students learn French, not English. Ordinary private middle schools in Peiping all teach English. The first-year junior high school students of the school who are graduates of Kongde Elementary School also study French, which raises doubts about the second article of the co-educational solution. Kongde Middle School is also one of the private middle schools. According to the second article, the school is also not allowed to enroll female students. Then how should the female graduates of Kongde Elementary School be placed? Can the names of the female students already enrolled in Kongde Middle School also be submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau? Will the Social Affairs Bureau be able to find ways to place them in other public and private girls' middle schools in Peiping? (Jin)</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Government of Dutch Borneo Burned Chinese Books. The Words in the Books Were Considered to Violate the Law. The Teachers of the Shanmu School Were Expelled from the Country. <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The government of Dutch West Borneo recently judged that the teachers of the Shanmu School in Kunshan (doulrouok) improperly revised the spelling of students, and was ordered by the Han Affairs Department of Java to be expelled from the country, and burned our country's textbooks, and strictly inspected the entry of Chinese books. After the Chinese Overseas United Association was reported, it was very indignant and will express its views. The reporter of the Industrial News Agency learned the whole story and recorded it in detail below.</p>
<p>Chinese Children's Composition Considered Inappropriate</p>
<p>The Shanmu School in Kunshan was founded by the Catholic Church. A few days ago, the Minister of the Political Department of the area and a translator went to the school to investigate and found that some of the students' compositions revised by the teachers were considered "uncontrolled," "words were intense," and "contained political provocation and malice to alienate various ethnic groups." The composition topics were "Unity" and "Banning Foreign Goods." There were inappropriate words in the students' compositions such as "Eastern × ghosts." There were also several student question-and-answer books that were considered to have harmed the feelings of various ethnic groups. The Minister of the Political Department immediately questioned the teachers, who explained that the questions were contained in the textbooks and were not invented by individuals.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection of Chinese Textbooks</p>
<p>The Political Department further inspected the textbooks and sent the Advanced Book II and Book IV of the Chinese textbooks used by the school and the Elementary Book VIII to the Han Affairs Department of Java for verification. It then instructed the Minister of the Political Department of Kunshan to collect the Advanced Book III Book I and the Elementary Book III, V, and VII of the Chinese textbooks of the school and send them to Java for review, and reported the situation to the Han Affairs Department for verification.</p>
<p>Burning Books and Expelling Teachers</p>
<p>The Han Affairs Department of Java reviewed the results and considered that the content of the textbooks violated local laws, and ordered the Political Department of Kunshan to confiscate all Chinese textbooks in the school, destroy them on a regular basis, and order the composition teacher to leave the country by a certain date. This announcement has been conveyed to the teachers and school authorities by the local officials of Kunshan. The Shanmu School is an educational institution of the Catholic Church in Kunshan, located in the Yichangxing Building at Lantinwei. The principal is Tan Zhengdao, a Dutch priest, who has specialized in Chaozhou dialect for two years in Chaozhou. The students are all Chinese, and most of the teachers come from Shantou.</p>
<p>More Stringent Inspection of Imported Chinese Books</p>
<p>The shipment of Chinese books to Kunshan has always had two inspection agencies. All imported books and newspapers are first reviewed by the customs wharf. If they are considered inappropriate, they will be detained. After the inspection, they are submitted to the Political Department for inspection. The local area cannot be said to be not strict in monitoring the import of books and newspapers. According to reports, the textbooks used by the Shanmu School were compiled and printed by the Catholic Church of Xujiahui in this city, so they were not inspected by the customs wharf and the Political Department when they entered. Because the Catholic priests in the area have always been respected by the society, but since the occurrence of this case, it is reported that the local area will strictly inspect the entry of Chinese books.</p>

Graduates of each class are well-prepared, resulting in excellent results in the entrance examinations.

This is largely due to the responsibility taken by the school principal, Dr. Lu Xirong, and the school board members for the graduates' future in higher education and career choices. Principal Lu is currently the Director of the Department of Etiquette and Customs at the Ministry of the Interior. The school board members include prominent figures such as Wang Boqun, a member of the National Government; Li Peitian, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission; Ma Junwu, President of Guangxi University; Huang Jingsi, Director of the High School Affiliated to Jinan University; bankers Chen Boquan and Zhang Naiwu; Jia Shiyi, Director of the Hubei Finance Department; Ou Yuanhuai, President of Daxia University; and Zheng Tonghe, Principal of Shanghai Provincial High School, all of whom are capable of leading figures in finding opportunities for the school's graduates.

<p>China Middle School</p>
<p>Since China Middle School on West Innes Road in this port was approved by the Ministry of Education, school affairs have been thriving. This semester, in addition to the existing faculty and staff, Xu Chunting, Pan Tianmin, Liu Zhigen, Wang Jingyun, Chen Mengqiu, and others have been newly hired to take on important teaching positions. The school buildings are exquisite, and the sports field is extremely large. This semester, the number of students applying for admission is very enthusiastic. Classes are scheduled to begin on September 10th, and there are still vacancies in all grades.</p>
<p>Huahua Middle School</p>
<p>Principal Li Baozhen of Huahua Middle School, in order to cultivate a correct theory of life for young people, has specially established a Maxims Lecture Series. During memorial week, he invites famous scholars from outside the school to give concise explanations of the central ideas of famous and effective maxims from China and abroad, as well as the success stories of great figures in history, with particular attention to the words and deeds of national heroes, in order to achieve the subtle influence of daily accumulation for the youth and lay the foundation for the rejuvenation of the nation.</p>
<p>Huadong Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>Huadong Girls' Middle School on Bellows Road is a well-known girls' school in this city. This year's graduates all passed the joint entrance examination. High school graduates were admitted to various famous universities. The school's sports teams have won the women's championship in the city's middle school sports meet twice in a row. The school is particularly strict in disciplining students. At the end of the last semester, students with unsatisfactory conduct were expelled. This shows the strict management of the school. The school will continue to enroll students for junior high school, senior high school general and business courses, and the affiliated Huaguo Primary School and Kindergarten on the 30th of this month, as well as transfer students. The primary school for girls also has boarding facilities.</p>
<p>Ranye Primary School</p>
<p>The private Ranye Primary School has been established for thirty years and has achieved remarkable results. It has long been registered with the Municipal Education Bureau. However, it has always rented civilian houses on Jiangyin Street in the South City as school buildings. The principal, Mr. Yang Ligen, believes that the population in that area is becoming increasingly dense, and the number of students seeking admission is increasing, making the school buildings insufficient. Therefore, he consulted with the director, Mr. Zhuge Wanming, and planned to prepare for the construction of a new school building. A directors' meeting was held the other day at Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road, where the chairman invited all the directors. Attendees included Yang Wutian, Chen Baoqing, and Weng Wenqiao. It was immediately decided to purchase more than two acres of land from Zhujingji near the original school site, actively preparing for construction to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Donghai Vocational Middle School</p>
<p>Since Principal Ye Jiaxing reformed Donghai Vocational Middle School on Liaoyang Road in Hongkou, school affairs have been developing day by day, and the school buildings have been renovated. Classes are scheduled to begin on August 26th, and September 1st is the deadline for the last enrollment.</p>
<p>Private Silk Workers' Primary School</p>
<p>The Private Silk Workers' Primary School on Tiantong Road, Shouyin Lane, is the abbreviation for the school for children of workers in the silk reeling industry in the Fourth District. Since its establishment nine years ago, the facilities have been perfect and the teaching has been strict. Recently, due to the economic downturn and the decline of the silk industry, unemployed workers have come to the school one after another to request fee reductions. It is reported that the school has approved their request and has established a fee reduction method. Children of silk workers in this district or those from poor families can get one-third of their tuition reduced.</p>
<p>Hubbei Middle School</p>
<p>Hubbei Middle School on Qiujiang Road opened on the 20th. More than 900 new and old students reported and registered. Due to insufficient teaching staff, workers are hired to build houses, hoping to complete them in the shortest possible time, and one hundred new steel-framed desks and chairs were made and sent to the school yesterday.</p>
<p>Nanyang Second Primary School</p>
<p>Nanyang Second Primary School is affiliated to Nanyang Middle School on Longhua Road. The original First Primary School is near Rihui Bridge.

<p>The Sichuan Road Youth Association's Sports Department has been hosting summer member swimming training classes and women's fitness classes in the past. The number of participants in this year's session has been very enthusiastic, with more than 120 members in the summer member class and more than 40 in the women's class. Since the start of training, two months have passed. The organizers of the association have decided to hold a water celebration in the association's swimming pool from 2:00 to 4:00 PM today to test the results of the trainees. All male and female trainees must prepare to participate. There are many male trainees, so they are divided into Group A and Group B. The chief referee is Mr. Ling Xitao, and the duties of referee and timekeeper are performed by Peng Sanmei, Chen Fuzhang, and others. All circles are welcome to visit, but due to the limited space of the pool, entry will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis. After the limit is reached, entry will be denied to maintain order. After the event, all levels of trainees will be invited to a tea party in the conference room to celebrate. The order of events is as follows:</p>

<p>The historic sixth Rotary Cup Tennis Tournament, which opened on the 11th of this month, has been repeatedly delayed by rain since the start. It has now entered the semi-final week. Yesterday at 4:30 PM, the doubles match between England's Derfoth and Panniphique against America's Carlson and Skya was originally scheduled at the Shanghai Club court on Conte Road. This match is crucial to the outcome of the final, as England and America have already won one singles match each, splitting the honors equally. The acquisition of the final right depends entirely on this doubles match. However, the weather was uncooperative. A heavy rain poured down around 2:00 PM, making the courts muddy and slippery, preventing the heroes from showing their skills. This good show had to be postponed for another day. According to the Sports Association, this match is scheduled for 4:30 PM today, still at the original location.</p>
<h3 id="e192">News from the Youth Cycling Touring Group <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Cycling Touring Group is composed entirely of formal businessmen who enjoy long-distance cycling. Therefore, they plan to take long-distance trips to the suburbs with a few like-minded comrades every weekend. I recall that on September 8th of last year, they traveled to Hangzhou along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway by bicycle, taking a total of eleven hours to reach their destination. Now, taking advantage of the completion of the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, they made their first cycling trip on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway on the weekend of August 18th. Due to the rough and uneven road surface, it took them more than eight hours to reach Wuxi. At first, they thought that the highway, being newly completed, would definitely be flat, so they expected to arrive in about six hours. Now, it took more than two hours extra, which is really disappointing. (For details, please read the English "Shanghai Times" on August 20th, in the sports news column, there is a detailed record of our seven trips.) Although, I feel that this trip was very interesting and I was not discouraged by the difficult roads. Therefore, I have already begun to prepare a cycling club, hoping to unite many comrades and often take long trips on weekends. The purpose of the club is to bring together a few people to have fun, and to help each other, encourage each other, and strive forward, which is conducive to progress, without comparing speed or deciding competition skills. If our country's highways are completed one by one, we may not be able to find a way to travel all over them. This all depends on our spirit and perseverance. During the current preparations, each aspect is not yet perfect, and we rely on the instructions of the comrades to achieve success. No membership fee is charged, as it is entirely an amateur nature, which is completely different from the purpose of other established clubs. However, members should each have a bicycle, which should not be too old or damaged, as it is feared that repairs along the way will be inconvenient for both the group and themselves. Also, those who can continue to ride for two or three hours can join the club. The club is scheduled to go to Wusong on August 25th (Sunday) (postponed if it rains), and will gather at the entrance of the Hongkou Swimming Pool from 6:00 to 6:30 in the morning. Those who are late will not be waited for. If you are unable to participate this Sunday (August 25th), you can fill out the attached paper and send it to our club at China Post Box 256. It is also planned to travel to Kunshan on September 1st (Sunday). Details will be announced later.</p>

<p>Shen Weigui, president of the Gaoqiao Sports Association, has recently realized that small ball sports are economical and convenient, and it is necessary to promote them in Gaoqiao. Therefore, he has asked the Shanghai Small Ball Association to initiate the Gaoqiao Small Ball Competition. There are many titles for the trophies, in addition to the champion and runner-up, there are also prizes for third, fourth, and fifth place. At the same time, the association also invites the following twelve teams to participate in the competition: Shanghai Zhonghua, Weiguang Yousheng, Sanmin, Lianghua, Jiudui, Huanan, Shixin, Huqing, Yueguang, Hongxing, and Qingxi. The above teams are all strong teams in the small ball world. Please bring your credentials and register immediately at the Small Ball Association at No. 4, the intersection of Luban Road and Taierfeisi Road. The deposit is 5 yuan, which will be collected by the association. It is also reported that Shen Zhengui will host a banquet at the Tongxinglou Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road at 7:00 tonight to entertain all circles for the purpose of networking.</p>
<p>It is also reported that there are not a few small ball teams in Shanghai, but it is often difficult to invite each other to compete because of a lack of promotion and the compilation of a directory of team contact information. The Shanghai Small Ball Association has taken this into consideration and has published an advertisement soliciting the addresses of each team in order to compile them into a booklet for statistics. All established small ball teams can directly write to the association to register (both local and foreign), and the deadline is this month. After all the information is printed, each team will receive a copy free of charge. Don't miss this good opportunity.</p>

<p>Who is "Too Fat"? We have already said above that his original name was George Curry. He was first spoiled by an indulgent mother, because she fed him too many candies, later he became ill, and too weak to work hard. By the time he was twelve years old he had become a pale, bloated child, sluggish, irritable and lazy. A friend advised her to send him to Plumfield, where he soon became refreshed, because here, sweets were rarely allowed, exercise was compulsory, and lessons were so interesting. "Too Fat" followed this gradual persuasion and unknowingly improved, until his worried mother was surprised, and fully admitted that the air in Plumfield did have some incredible magic.</p>
<p>Thorny was a sharp and cunning boy, he was sent to this school simply because it was a "reform" one. Many people might think of him as a clever and astute boy, and even though these qualities are praised by Americans, Mr. Bhaer did not approve of the conduct by which he exhibited these qualities, and felt that his premature sophistication and his love of money were a big problem, no lighter than Dolly's stutter or Dick's hunchback.</p>
<p>Ned as like other billions of fourteen year old boys, was all legs, stumbling, crashing. His family called him "Clumsy," often afraid he would trip over a chair, or turn over chairs and tables, or knock over small objects. He often boasted that he could do this and that, but rarely did so in practice to prove his words. Lacking courage, he also could not avoid gossiping, habitually bullying younger children, and flattering older children. We cannot simply say he was bad, but he was definitely one of the misled.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold, the senior commercial attache of the United States in China, I have talked to him several times, and he always said the benefits of Chinese goods and the infinite hope of Chinese goods. This time he spoke at the Shanghai Rotary Club, and his words were even more thorough. Mr. Yinliang's abridged translation of this newspaper on August 18th made people feel infinite emotion and infinite anticipation after reading it. He said: "The reason why national products cannot compete with others is not only because they cannot be improved and are not managed with new methods, but also because the Chinese themselves do not use them first, and foreigners will naturally not use them. I can give a few examples: A few weeks ago, I went to Guangzhou with the American Economic Mission. The banking community held a welcome reception in a Chinese hotel, and the tea used was entirely foreign tea. The Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce used Chinese tea when welcoming them, but they drank it in a foreign way, using excellent black tea and diluting it with milk, completely losing the flavor of Chinese tea. Someone suggested that the mission find ways to promote Chinese tea, so we told him to promote Chinese tea in Chinese society first. Sometimes in Chinese hotels, Chinese trains, and Chinese clubs, it is simply impossible to find any Chinese tea. If you don't let foreigners drink Chinese tea and let them taste the benefits of Chinese tea, how can you get them to buy Chinese tea?" These words are so straightforward and thorough, so Mr. Yinliang summarized: "To get foreigners to use Chinese goods, first improve Chinese goods and get the Chinese to use them themselves." As far as I know, the current general unpromising and shameless Chinese people still believe in and enjoy using foreign goods. A certain organization openly said: We have never used national products. I don't know what the motive is for this perverse attitude? Recently, the Greater China Rubber Factory has created automobile tires, and the products can be said to be on par with foreign products. Many highways are enthusiastically adopting them. I heard that a certain association, no matter what, refuses to adopt them. Has this element that hates national products forgotten that he is Chinese? Alas, if the Chinese themselves do not trust and love to use national products, what hope is there for the country? Rubber tires are just one type of national product. In addition, such as food, drink, use, and wear, if everyone can take out their conscience and gradually improve them first, and then use them themselves, then there will be a glimmer of hope for the future of national products.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Thrift Movement and National Products <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The high level of national worship of foreign goods and the cultivation of extravagant lifestyles are the main reasons for my country's huge import surplus over the years. At the same time, we can work hard to promote the thrift movement and the promotion of national products, which is the only trend to save the current crisis.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, since the commodities of imperialism broke through our closed-door policy, on the one hand, Western material civilization has gradually been introduced into the country. At the same time, the goods of several industrially advanced countries first arrived in the cities of our country and began their dumping tactics. As a result, we, who had backward production and had never seen machine-made goods, were greatly tempted, and the result was that in the lives of our people, whether spiritual or material, they tended to be westernized and extravagant, and a large number of foreign goods salesmen were produced, creating the foundation for the collapse of the domestic economy and the bankruptcy of industry and commerce over the years.</p>
<p>Let us take a closer look at the people in today's society. In the current situation, how rampant are those who live a Westernized and extravagant life? In general, the bourgeoisie must wear imported clothes, eat European food, live in Western houses, and travel in cars. Even cosmetics and stationery must be foreign. But then look at the middle and lower classes? They are also affected by the upper class. Although a salaried class who relies on twenty or thirty dollars to maintain their lives, their husbands must also wear suits and leather shoes, and their wives must perm their hair, paint their eyebrows, dye their nails, wear cheongsams, and high heels, as if they are not enough to be proud of themselves without this. However, on the other hand, the import surplus has increased sharply, and there is a shocking leak every year, and the country is becoming weaker day by day. Is this not their gift? Moreover, even from their personal point of view, have we not often heard of "unemployment" and "suicide" recently? The reason is nothing more than the result of too extravagant family life, economic pressure, business failure, and the fall of personality, leading to this final fate.</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply feel that under the current enthusiastic promotion of the slogan of national products, it is necessary to work hard to promote the thrift movement at the same time. I remember that the New Life Movement has included the national product movement and thrift to save the country in the same category, and we must follow it closely. Recently, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and many groups have also called for the promotion of the thrift movement. This kind of opinion and trend is very correct. In this time of national poverty and exhaustion, I hope that everyone will not return to the Westernized and extravagant life, and instead find a way out for the future of national products!</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Chinese People Should Firmly Remember National Product Trademarks <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>Since recently, we can say that we are in an era of commercial warfare. If you want your own goods to sell well and earn other people's money, the first thing is to pay attention to the authenticity of the goods and meet the needs of the times. But once you have achieved your goal, you are still afraid of others imitating and counterfeiting. Therefore, adding a trademark can help you recognize each other. Since the Chinese people have advocated national products, the manufacturing output has been increasing day by day, and almost all daily necessities are available. And each goods has a registered trademark for identification. Therefore, when Chinese people buy domestic goods with patriotism, remembering the trademarks of domestic goods is also a more convenient method.</p>
<p>Trademarks are commonly called brands. When you mention a certain brand of goods, you will think of the quality of that brand. For example, when you mention "Guben Soap," you know that it is effective in removing dirt, durable, and does not damage clothes; when you mention "Triangle Brand West Lake Towel," you know that it is soft and absorbent; when you mention "Invincible Brand Tooth Powder," you know that it can clean teeth, strengthen teeth, and has a fragrant smell; when you mention "Double Ten Brand Toothbrush," you know that it is comfortable for brushing teeth and does not shed bristles; when you mention "Lihe Brand Washbasin," you know that it is beautiful and durable. Remembering the trademarks of national products is a clear proof of trusting national products. If the Chinese people can all do this, are we still afraid that national products will not sell well?</p>
<p>The above are just a few famous national product trademarks. If we go further and remember the national product trademarks of various necessities, then when you don't have time to buy them yourself, even if you send servants or commission agents, you only need to explain the goods and trademarks, and there will be no mistakes. Even some stores that are used to selling foreign goods will find it difficult to use their tricks to pass off foreign goods as national goods!</p>
<p>To implement the method of firmly remembering national product trademarks, in the family, parents should naturally take the lead. Whenever you buy a certain product, in addition to remembering it yourself, you must also point out to your children what this thing is, what the brand trademark is, and which domestic factory it is produced from. You may not remember the factory name so much, but you must let them firmly remember the brand. In schools, teachers should naturally take the lead, especially in primary schools, because middle school students can already identify them themselves. Or sometimes hold tests and ask them to say the trademark names of domestic goods, or during games and exercises, such as when performing "Wearing the Dragon Gate," where everyone usually reports a flower name or bird name, now ask them to report a domestic product trademark name, which is also quite interesting. In short, there are plenty of ways to remember national product trademarks, only that the Chinese people work hard to implement them!</p>

<p>This time, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, due to the issue of registered medicines, elected Zhou Bangjun, Xu Xiaochu, and others to go to Beijing to personally present their opinions to the Department of Health. I also went along. Qin Moxiao, a reporter from this newspaper stationed in Beijing, invited us to visit the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, took the opportunity to visit the Tan Yankai Tomb, and then went to Linggu Temple to visit Xu Pengfei, Chairman of the Committee for the Construction of the Cemetery for Fallen Soldiers. Mr. Xu is from Wuxing, Zhejiang, and was a close friend of the martyr Chen Qimei. He is quite straightforward in nature. When talking about the issue of promoting national products, he cited a story to prove the enthusiasm and perseverance of the Japanese, which is worth recording. It is not that I am increasing the ambition of others and diminishing my own prestige, but the fact is so. I hope that compatriots who are addicted to using foreign goods will emulate each other after reading this. Then, even if the national crisis is serious, it may not be possible to save it. Otherwise, it is useless to advocate it verbally, and if you cannot put words into action, the current silver is limited, and there will always be a day when it runs out. Even if strong neighbors do not force me with guns and cannons, I will die of economic exhaustion, just like a person suffering from anemia. Even without an external infection, I will die of my own accord. Mr. Xu said: During the late Qing Dynasty, I had already changed my attire. When I was with Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Japan, one day I planned to make a set of spring suits. I went to the market to look at the goods and saw that most stores were priced at 28 yuan. Later, I discovered a store that was priced at only 20 yuan, and the material was the same. The lower price was even more refined than the higher price, so I ordered a set in this store. On Sunday, when Japanese friends gathered, I saw that the material they were wearing was coarser than what I was wearing. When asked about the price, they all said 28 yuan. Comparing it with what I was wearing, they also admitted that it was cheap and good. When asked where I bought it, I told them the address and store number. They all said that I was planning to buy it at this store because the material in this store was foreign goods. What we are wearing is Japanese goods. You are Chinese, so naturally you choose to buy from cheaper people. If we also don’t use domestic goods, then our domestic woolen industry will never improve, and the outflow of rights and interests will be unimaginable. Even if we know that domestic goods are more expensive and inferior than foreign goods, we should also promote them with pain. If you want beauty and cheapness, making a set of suits for 20 yuan will completely flow into foreign countries. Now, buying a set of domestic suits for 28 yuan, each person spends 8 yuan more, which is a small amount, but calculated across the country, the amount is very large. The domestic woolen industry has a surplus due to its wide sales, so it will gradually improve in manufacturing, and there is no fear of not being able to achieve the four words "cheap and good" and compete with foreign goods. Therefore, we are willing to pay a high price to buy goods of inferior quality, although it is painful for a while, but the hope is endless. When I heard what they said at the time, I deeply admired their broad vision. More than 20 years later, every time I see Japanese goods that have improved and are cheaper, I often think of the scene of the conversation at the time. Therefore, I made up my mind not to use foreign goods from that year on. Now I am used to it and don't feel that Chinese goods are unusable. However, fashionable friends who are influenced by European culture often think that Chinese goods are not as good as foreign goods in terms of quality and efficacy, and the price is not cheap, so they are unwilling to use them. If everyone doesn't use them, the sales volume will not be large, and even if they don't go bankrupt, they will only barely maintain themselves. How can they hope to improve? I hope you will announce this intention in the National Products Weekly to help promote national products. I admire his enthusiasm and specially express it to tell the readers.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Promoting National Products Depends Entirely on Conscience <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Yi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Originally, when a person does things in the world, no matter what he does, he must rely on his conscience to do it well. Is it only "promoting national products" that is so?</p>
<p>However, this article of mine is written for "National Products Weekly". Therefore, I will specifically talk about "promoting national products".</p>
<p>We know that "promoting national products" is not something that started today, it has actually been going on for a long time. However, the results are getting worse and worse! Now we don't have to ask for "foreign goods" not to have a "trade surplus", we only need to ask for the number of "foreign goods trade surplus" to only decrease and not increase, and that is still impossible! Let alone "national goods" being able to have a "trade surplus"? In this situation, "promoting national products" is simply empty talk! It has been like this for decades up to today. How can we not blame the national economy and people's livelihood for getting worse every day? Alas! This... This... This... What is the reason for this? Thinking carefully, this is entirely a matter of each person's "conscience"!</p>
<p>Because, a person with a "conscience" can do anything well. "Promoting national products" is also like this. If you have a "conscience", then you say "promoting national products", you must be sincere and will not deceive people. Naturally, you can say it and do it. Otherwise, "promoting national products", no matter how good it sounds on the mouth, is unfortunately insincere. What you wear; what you eat; what you drink; what you smoke; and everything you use, are still all "foreign goods" behind your back! This kind of self-deceiving behavior is really untrustworthy. If a person is untrustworthy, what "conscience" does he have? It is only because he has no "conscience" that he will sell "foreign goods". It is only because he has no "conscience" that he will purchase and use "foreign goods". How can we not be bad if we promote "national goods" like this? Therefore, I want to nag here and say: "Promoting national products depends entirely on conscience". I just want to hope that everyone will take out their "conscience" when promoting "national goods" in the future!</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Plan to Make Newspapers from Straw (Part 1) <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>The machine for making newspapers is not a problem. It's like cooking a small dish. It only depends on the skill of the cook. There is no need to order an electric stove or gas stove. What is already available, such as the Pinglian machine of Longzhang Tianzhang, can be used to make both sides smooth. As for the reel type, the machine itself comes with a reel, so there is no difficulty. The only difficulty is the pulp problem. My brother and I have been making pulp and paper from straw for more than ten years. It can be said that we have already succeeded. However, it is not cost-effective to buy straw in the city. One yuan only gets about three dan. Therefore, it cannot compete with foreign newspapers for cheapness. But making pulp in rural areas can save the cost of transportation. Its cost is more than two-thirds cheaper. Moreover, it is not only for making newspapers, but also for selling grass pulp abroad. Let’s take Jiangbei as an example.</p>
<p>According to a friend, straw in places such as Dongtai and Yancheng can be bought for eight dan per yuan. Wheat straw is twice as much. However, shipping it to Shanghai is very uneconomical because its value is too cheap and the ship price is more expensive than the grass price. According to the proportion of shipping cotton, a ship can load more than 300 dan. The Chuan donation package costs 90 yuan net. The journey takes one month. If you ship straw without paying taxes, the ship price can be cheaper, about 60 yuan. If you calculate it for 300 dan, the cost of shipping each dan has already cost two jiao. Adding the grass price of one jiao and two and a half fen, it is the same as the price of one yuan and three dan in Pudong, Shanghai. However, in places such as Chongming and Haimen, the price of straw is only two and a half dan per yuan, but the scale used is actually the same as the lime kiln scale. Each jin is equivalent to 22 liang of the balance. Then each yuan is equivalent to more than 340 jin, which is also equal to one yuan and three and a half dan in Wuxi. Because I am aware of the difficulty of shipping from Sichuan, I feel that making pulp locally in Dongtai and other places is a great source of profit that can be developed and is most economical. Because making pulp from straw yields one ton for every 4,000 jin. Each ship can load 20 tons, which is equivalent to loading three ships of grass into one ship. The freight can be saved by two-thirds. If each ship costs 60 yuan, the shipping cost per ton is only two yuan. Adding the grass price of five yuan, the total is only seven yuan. The lime used can be brought back on an empty ship. But if the water feet are not suitable, sodium sulfide can be used instead. Each barrel of 60 pounds costs 3.5 yuan and can make 1.5 tons of grass pulp. Then the 20 tons of grass pulp used only needs 14 barrels. The total board is less than 6 dan. The cost of shipping is also calculated at two jiao per dan, which is only 1.2 yuan. The total statistics for each ship is 20 tons. Including the grass price, the cost is only 211.8 yuan. Selling 14.4 yuan per ton, you can get 288 yuan, which is a net profit of 76.2 yuan. According to my humble plan, if the rural cooperative promotes a small workshop, with 40 people operating each, they can produce 5 tons per day. If 160 people work, they can load one ship per day. They can produce 600 tons per month and sell them for 8,640 yuan. Deducting the advance payment of 40 yuan each to 160 people, totaling 6,400 yuan. The shipping cost is 1,800 yuan. Lime or sulfur is 1,544 yuan. The total is 3,984 yuan. The remaining 3,656 yuan is obtained. After deducting 10% of the cooperative's expenses, the remaining amount is 3,200 yuan, which is 20 yuan per person. Including the advance payment of 10 yuan, they have already received 30 yuan. The total grass required is 24,000 dan. If divided among 160 people, each person produces 150 dan of grass per month. Originally selling 8 dan for one yuan, the income is only 18.75 yuan. Now they get 30 yuan. The monthly living expenses per person can be 11.25 yuan more, which is enough for the food of two old and young people. Although there are only 160 operators, if each person's 20 yuan is enough for the food of five people, it is enough to prevent 800 orphans from starving. If you are afraid of a shortage of straw, you can calculate it by the area of the field. Each mu can average 10 dan. But with 30,000 mu of land, it is enough for them to operate all year round. If each person farms 40 mu with two people, then there should be 1,500 farmers. Now the number of workers is only one-tenth. If they operate during the slack season, then each person operates for one month each year, which is more than enough. However, if you operate at one time, the investment required is about 50,000, which requires the assistance of a bank. As for sales, the total amount of 7,200 tons is only enough to supply one cardboard factory. The total price of the grass pulp sold is 7,200 tons, which can get more than 100,000 yuan. When the cooperative takes 10%, it has already obtained 10,000. To pay the bank's interest, calculated at 1% per month, return it monthly, calculated at 8,000 yuan per month. In the first three months, it is treated as accounts receivable, and the interest is 1,500 yuan. By the fourth month, 24,000 yuan has been paid off, then the interest is only 260 yuan. In the fifth month, another 8,000 is returned, then the interest is only 160 yuan. In the sixth month, another 8,000 is returned, and the interest only needs 80 yuan. In the seventh month, the entire amount is paid off. The total interest paid is only 2,000. There is still 8,000 yuan left, which can be used to pay the members, directors, supervisors, and other rewards.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stimulated by Sassoon's continued aggressive buying, tight foreign exchange market, and large players covering short positions, and rose to the 890 yuan level.

<p>In previous years, Shanghai's business, especially during the peak season of new autumn for department stores, saw frequent use of silver funds. However, this year, much of it has been affected by the slow adjustment of the financial industry. Spot goods are difficult to purchase, and no one pre-orders goods. Therefore, although the market is in a boom season, its idle state is no less than that during the slack season of hot summer. The repayment of financial public debt this time has not yet been fulfilled, and the headliners of its counterparties are unevenly distributed. Those who are in short supply have no ability to repay, and even those who have surplus funds are still waiting and seeing. Because of this mutual concern, the market atmosphere is even more stagnant. Yesterday, the price of foreign short-term loans in the market was 18 cents in the morning and noon, a slight decrease of 2 cents compared to the previous day, but the headliners still did not add water, and the easing of the loan market remained the same. Most of the warehouses did not accept funds. The volume of short-term note transactions was 3.45 million in the morning, 300,000 in new transactions, 200,000 in bull market transactions, and 600,000 in transactions at the Small General Chamber of Commerce. The amount of banknotes recovered was 600,000, the amount of secret-mark notes issued was 500,000, and the amount of circulating notes was 300,000. The amount of foreign pledges redeemed was 1.22 million (including a portion of real estate pledges that were discounted, approximately 400,000), and the amount of new loans made (for cotton, silk, groceries, sugar, northern goods, and piece goods) was 600,000. In addition, the amount of securities pledged was 200,000-300,000, the source of customer funds was 200,000, and the outflow was 250,000. The amount of foreign public orders received by Qian Zhuang was over 4.44 million, the amount of foreign headline funds received was 3.9 million, the amount of customer remittance funds was over 400,000, and the amount of cash received was over 500,000. In terms of bank receipts and disbursements, foreign banks received over 1.78 million in note payments, over 3.34 million in various goods, remittance pledges, and miscellaneous payments, over 400,000 in telegraphic remittance funds, over 900,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, and over 1.4 million in special remittance funds (including the exchange rate difference for shillings and foreign exchange rates). Warehouse intake was 700,000. Chinese banks received over 2.56 million in note payments, over 3.3 million in various goods, remittance pledges, tax payments, and miscellaneous payments, over 700,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds, over 400,000 in telegraphic remittance funds, and over 500,000 in special remittance funds. Warehouse outflow was 300,000. Japanese banks received over 2.22 million in note payments, over 3.9 million in various goods, remittance pledges, and miscellaneous payments, over 500,000 in telegraphic remittance funds, over 300,000 in special remittance funds, and over 700,000 in foreign exchange settlement funds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of small silver dollars from Jiangnan suddenly rose. The morning market was still stable, with the same price as the previous day at 832 yuan, but the afternoon market suddenly increased by 2 yuan, totaling 834 yuan. However, transactions were very rare, with 2,000 jiao in the morning and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon. Small silver dollars from Guangdong also rose by more than 2 yuan, totaling 737.5 yuan in the morning and 737.6 yuan in the afternoon. The volume of transactions was easy to achieve, with 260,000 jiao in the morning and 80,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins also rose by 500 wen, totaling 344,000 qian wen. The volume of transactions was 51,600 strings, equivalent to 15,000 yuan in silver dollars. In addition, the total number of bills exchanged in the city was 1,020,0734.46 silver dollars, including a total of 4,723,899.55 silver dollars exchanged, 3,152,004.73 silver dollars remitted, and a total collected amount of 1,401,305.24 silver dollars from Qian Zhuang and 843,594.94 silver dollars from other sources.</p>

<p>Although the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was approaching settlement yesterday, both bulls and bears were still holding their positions, observing each other. Large bulls emerged, but they were slow and not in a hurry. Judging from the situation, they may first take a downstream route, and the momentum of squeezing has been dispersed, and it will not be too violent. Arbitrage transactions are no longer worthwhile due to the proximity of high prices and the distance of low prices, and most have stopped. The Northern Gang, however, is selling off quite a bit, and the trend shows signs of loosening. However, since the amount of outstanding accounts is still large, fluctuations will still occur later. The market yesterday opened slightly better by 12 cents, but quickly showed weakness. The next session saw chaos, with alternating highs and lows, a completely stalemate situation. In the two afternoon sessions, as numbers 11 and 48 continued to sell off, each session saw a rally of 5 cents or 10 cents. Overall, it was a fluctuating situation. In reality, the bulls were gradually becoming impatient. There are only three days left for trading this month, and there will still be some competition. As a result, the market price fell more than it rose. The largest drop was 30 cents for the 23rd pass. The total transaction volume was 9,155,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>According to a report from New Reindeer Foreign Company, the New York stock market yesterday (20th) fell again at the beginning of the morning, and then returned to the same level as the commodity market. There was considerable demand for military stocks, copper stocks rose, and aircraft stocks rose by several cents to more than one yuan. US steel reached this year's highest peak. Stocks on the small exchange eased slightly, and the bond market declined. The total transaction volume for the day was 1.98 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning but fell in the afternoon, and the situation became more frustrating. The market relationship of this month, due to the approaching delivery period, 800 packages of Fugui yarn and 100 packages of Shuanglong yarn have been released from the warehouse. As a result, panic suddenly arose. At the same time, the movement of recent month speculators wavered. The spot yarn market became even more deserted. In the afternoon, the price of the current month plummeted by 1.8 yuan.</p>
<p>Recent Month Yarn Prices Fall Drastically</p>
<p>The opening price of speculative yarn was firm due to the rebound in the gold price. The market atmosphere in the field stabilized, and sellers were not eager to sell, so the prices of each month rose by 2, 3, or 4 cents. However, the trading volume in the field was quite sparse. As a result, the prices of each month rose slightly by 1, 2, or 3 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, the price of the current month suddenly declined, and the distant months also fell due to the fluctuation. According to some sources, the short sellers had 800 packages of a certain yarn from the 16th mill and 100 packages of yarn from the 17th mill. There were also 600 packages of Mupyang yarn from the 20th mill. There was also talk of delivering Tianguan yarn, causing widespread panic. The bulls closed their positions, and the market price fell gradually. The sales of spot yarn became more sluggish. As a result, the price of the current month fell by 1.8 yuan compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months fell by 1.1 to 0.5 yuan. However, the prices of three-ply yarn rose by 2 yuan for recent months and 1.5 yuan for distant months. Sold 600 packages of Jinchang, 600 packages of Renfeng, 1,450 packages of Yida, 400 packages of Daji, 400 packages of Senkang, 600 packages of Runkang, 1,500 packages of Hengchang.

The highest and lowest prices and the closing price for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Clearing Prices Also Fall</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn remained sluggish. It is estimated that all the gangs bought only 302 packages throughout the day. The market price fell by 2.5 cents. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below: Inland 20, Jiangxi 60, Shantou 5, Ningbo 5, Guangdong 60, Peers 2, Fujian 1, Xuzhou 50.</p>

<p>The August futures, which had the strongest pull from the bulls in the cotton market, saw a decline again today. According to the market, the Cotton Inspection Office has inspected and qualified over 10,000 dan of cotton. Some of the bulls have emerged, causing the market to loosen. New cotton, due to favorable weather conditions, is said to be delivered in October, including Yao flower and Taicang flower, and the market is showing fatigue.</p>
<p>August Futures Approach the 6 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The opening price of speculative cotton was firm due to the recovery of the gold price. The market atmosphere rose slightly, and the prices of each month rose slightly again. However, the bulls in the broader month futures emerged, and the situation became weaker. As a result, the price of the current month fell by 1 cent compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months rose by 0.5 to 1 cent. In the afternoon, the price of August futures suddenly plummeted. The market rumors said that some of the bulls had closed their positions, so by the second and third sessions, the price broke through the 6 yuan mark. New cotton in distant months, due to the approaching season for new cotton to enter the market, has more short sellers, and the market condition is becoming more sluggish. As a result, the price of the current month fell by 6 cents compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months fell by 1 to 2.5 cents. Sold 1,600 dan of Zhenda, 600 dan of Hexing, 700 dan of Yuanyi, 1,100 dan of Changyu, 1,200 dan of Xiesheng, 1,000 dan of Gengfeng, 1,700 dan of Shenji, and 1,000 dan of Dachangcheng.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a drop of 9 to 13 points for each month. Trading was very quiet due to loan issues. In the early morning, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, bulls closed their positions and foreign merchants sold. Based on the report that loans were below 1.2 cents, the market price fell slightly. Subsequently, with the strong advocacy of a 1.2 cent loan by the representative of Punkhae, the market improved slightly. Short selling was peaceful, Southern merchants disregarded desolidation, the weather conditions were favorable in the West, there was continuous rain in the Southwest, and the East was too wet. At the close, some people covered their shorts, and the market remained relatively stable. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 6 to 11 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices fell by 3 to 4 points. The Indian cotton market was stable, with the prices of Pingguoer and Aomu La rising by 0.75 roby, and the price of Aomu La rising by 0.375 to 1.5 roby. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 20th):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources of local rice (South Shanghai) still reached over 20 merchants (a total of over 4,000 shi). After the public confidence turned negative the day before yesterday, the market conditions yesterday showed sluggish sales as soon as the market opened. Bao Wei also only did business with over 300 packages from Yantai and other merchants. As a result, the market prices of all thick Japonica and thin Indica varieties fell by 12 cents, and the price of Du Yangjian also decreased by a few cents. However, Yin Yuan relied on a shortage of goods and good sales, so the market atmosphere was uniquely good. Dong Xin and Xin Yangjian also fell by 12 cents. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 26 to 27 boats of various sources arrived from the lower reaches of the river. The spot market for white Japonica and early rice was calm, and the price varied slightly by 12 cents. The sales of Dong Xin Japonica and new customer Jian were quite strong, and the road to sales was dull. The market price fell by 2 cents. The arrival of new Can Jian was small and sales were active, and the market situation was stable. The sales of thin Indica and Bai Yuan were slightly sluggish, and the market situation was also weak. The other goods also showed weakness.</p>
<p>Yesterday, new Yongjiang rice continued to arrive in Shanghai, totaling 700 yuan. It was all purchased by the local street office. 334 packages of Sichuan rice also arrived, with a price of 9.75 yuan, and was also purchased by the local street office. Currently, the local street office is purchasing vigorously. In addition to the active sales of customer Xiang as it arrives, the desire for foreign rice is also active. The owner of Saigon No. 1 rice is holding out. The inventory of Saigon No. 3 is also low, and the prices of each have risen by 56 cents to nearly a yuan. Xiaojiao and Huan Luo are in a stalemate. A total of 4,000 packages of West rice were sold throughout the day, and over 1,000 packages of Xiaojiao Huan Luo were sold. With the exception of a small amount of No. 3 and broken rice purchased by inland merchants, everything was purchased by the local street office.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Flour Market Regains Momentum <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price in the flour market was due to the quoted prices of foreign wheat. Chicago rose by about 67 cents, and Canada rose by 5 cents, so although the market atmosphere was trending positive, factories were acquiring current months. Customers were also buying distant months, so the prices of each month were about 1 cent higher than the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, transactions remained active, but the market atmosphere fell back again. Fuxin, Fufeng, and other factories were selling distant months, and it was rumored that the combined price of current foreign wheat was slightly lower than before. Therefore, after a brief rebound, the market fell back again. Judging from the time, it is the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the spot sales of mooncakes are booming. However, the purchasing power is still weak and will not be recovered in a short period of time. As a result, the price of the current month remained unchanged, while the prices of September to December fell by 2.5 cents, and the price of January rose by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Futures Wheat Market Weak in Bull-Bear Competition <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was slightly stable. The quoted prices of foreign wheat rose by 5, 6, or 7 cents, and the gold market also rebounded. Under normal circumstances, the price should be high, but the market transactions were actually sparse. Both internal and external buyers and sellers could gain or lose, and no attention was paid. The competition between the two sides was weak, so the market had little response. Therefore, although the opening price was 23 cents higher, it then tended to fluctuate. In addition, a certain firm's unloading of foreign wheat caused the public confidence to become even more calm. As a result, the price of the current month remained unchanged, the prices of each month were 3 cents higher, and the prices of October and November rose by 2 cents. In the spot wheat market, because the factory demand has not opened and there have been no formal deliveries, it is said that the price of special high-quality goods in the southern market has opened at 6.8 cents, but it is relatively weak. However, the factories are still rarely involved.</p>
<p>The U.S. wheat and miscellaneous grain expert Snow estimated that the production of spring wheat would be 145 million hectoliters, a decrease of 93 million hectoliters compared to the August 1 estimate of 238 million hectoliters. The European situation has a stable impact on wheat prices. The factory market and Winnipeg are more stable than before.</p>

<p>Yesterday, 100 packages of Xin Hongliang (i.e., sorghum seeds) from Jiangbei were launched. The annual environment for Hongliang in the Jiangbei area this year is particularly good, so it was launched early before the End of Heat. In previous years, it was necessary to launch after the festival, and its identity inevitably carried moisture and softness. The seeds are still thick and fat, and the price is 3.2 yuan. They were purchased by inland merchants, and the old goods turned weak as a result. Yesterday, 100 packages of Bengbu goods were opened, with a price of 3.1 yuan. The market price fell by 5 cents compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>This year, the inventory of high-quality goods in various production areas in Hunan and Hubei provinces has been almost sold out. Hankou was originally a concentration place, but because the arrival does not meet the sales, there is no inventory. Since there are more than two months before the production of new crops, we have to lower the standards. Even if the degree is insufficient, it is accepted. The foreign market oil in Hankou has been sold to 49.6 yuan per dan. The follow-up merchants seem to be impossible without 50 yuan. Generally, the price of oil with insufficient degree is determined according to the degree. However, the standard is still the price of sufficient degree. In the future, foreign merchants will purchase the goods regardless of the degree and accept all of them. If so, the export of tung oil will have another outlet.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly better due to the slightly tight official gold, but the transactions were not many. The trade association Liu Pan 24 coarse sand white spot goods were sold slightly in the morning, with a price of 17.25 yuan, an increase of 5 cents. The transshipment goods did not reach the original price. Taigu sugar and the local factory's cotton white were not significantly up or down. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Association sold a total of 3,000 packages of Huizhou coarse white and medium sand white in the bidding, but none of them were sold at the original price. 2,000 packages of Dutch coarse white were sold at 17.2 yuan, 110 packages were sold. A Chao merchant issued a number of more than 100 packages of Huanggang Qing, with a price of 10.3 to 2 cents. As there is no follow-up delivery, the trend turned tight, and the price was better than the previous market by 23 cents.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Depictions of the Ocean <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Lu</p>
<p>Because I am someone who likes the ocean, I have a special fondness for texts that depict it. I often think that the beauty of the ocean changes along with the state of mind of the observer. Sometimes it's a loving mother, sometimes a sleeping infant, and sometimes it seems like an all-consuming tyrant or devil. Some people say that the sea holds many secrets that it can tell people things they don't know. When I face the ocean or read texts that depict it, I don't feel that this is an exaggeration at all.</p>
<p>In the past, what I loved to read the most was the section describing the ocean in D'Annunzio's "The Triumph of Death," where a dying person listens to the howling of the sea waves under a starlit sky and is aroused by all sorts of bizarre hallucinations. Although it takes the form of a novel, reading it is just like reading a richly imagined, eloquently worded prose poem. Burton Rascoe said that his writing is imaginative and descriptive, and this can be seen in this text. The roar and weeping of the sea, the bewilderment of dreams, the threat of death, and the solemnity of the twilight that appears at dusk, all weave together in the lines into a most enchanting and mysterious picture. He writes of the harmonious music of the sea slowly unfolding under the pure lilac sky of July. He also uses personification to write of the sea's anger, jealousy, humility, dejection, ridicule, comfort, groaning, and prayer, all kinds of behaviors. His descriptions are ornate, not stingy in using all the new words and adjectives that can be used.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gorky also uses personification to depict the sea, but it is all simple. He uses very few strange words, only sketching a few strokes like a watercolor painting, and a vivid image appears on the paper. In works such as "Malva" and "The Birth of a Man," he uses the most economical and effective relief-style techniques to depict the sea. He seems to see a few key points of the beauty of the ocean, focusing on expressing these key points and abandoning the dross that is not worth writing about, so the beauty of the scenery is concentrated within the scope of these few sentences. He writes "the sea is laughing" and "the sea is surging with cheerful waves," this "healthy laughter" that makes people yearn is also a symbol of the state of mind of the giant in this period of rebirth. Simplicity, purity, and strength are precisely the unique advantages of new literature.</p>
<p>The excellence of some older writers' techniques for depicting the ocean is still something we cannot forget. For example, Pierre Loti's "An Iceland Fisherman," which was recently translated, writes of the sea as mysteriously lovely and at the same time frighteningly frigid; in the looping depictions, it reveals a kind of Nordic atmosphere. Each chapter is like a gradually unfolding picture scroll. Writing about the sea, he did not forget to write about the people on the sea, so his pen not only conveys the struggle between people and natural forces, but also another aspect of the sea as seen from the psychological perspective of people, writing out the entire color taken from the outside world, but reflected in the inner world, while at the same time giving the mood the same tone.</p>
<p>I once saw a book by Ibner Nas titled "Our Sea," in which the activities of a female spy during the European War were written about, with many strange things in the sea, which was written in a rather monotonous way. In addition, what I can't bear to let go of is Lafcadio Hearn's essay about watching the sunrise on the beach, which takes great pains to describe the rising sun, the waves and sails under the rising sun. Although the environment written about is not much different from what Gorky wrote, the mood is completely different. Gorky's description of the sea is full of life-giving, romantic exaggeration, while Lafcadio Hearn only uses the tone of a lyric poem to calmly narrate the fairytale-like realm of a love song, bringing a kind of hazy and tactful poetic interest. The former is a "wild cry" for "natural force," while the latter is just the work of a meditative poet lingering on the scenery. Life determines the work, and there are such cases.</p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, I don't know how many authors have spent their energy on depicting the ocean, and there's no end to what could be said, but what we demand now is not a poet who is intoxicated by the wonderful scenery of the ocean and engages in mysterious meditation, but a singer who can see the "sprouts of new life" in all great things, to sing and depict the "angry tide of the Chinese sea"!</p>
<h3 id="e218">Analysis of Word Formation <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Fuquan</p>
<p>Regardless of using "phonetic symbols," National Language Romanization, or National Language Latin Script, the defining, reforming, and creating of "words" is a common, fundamental issue.</p>
<p>Here, we will attempt to analyze the formation of words. (Of course, this is just a starting point.)</p>
<p>(I) Same Meaning—Wang Yinzhi's "Jing Yi Shu Wen," Volume 32, "Tongshuo Xia," "Parallel Placement of Two Characters in Classics and Commentaries with Same Meaning": "Yinzhi respectfully notes: In ancient exegesis, repetition was not avoided; often, there were two characters placed in parallel, with the same meaning above and below. Interpreters who divide them into two meanings miss the point. For example, in the 'Tai Xiang Zhuan,' 'The sovereign thereby regulates and completes the way of heaven and earth, and assists and guides the suitability of heaven and earth.'… 'Regulate' and 'complete' have the same meaning… 'Assist' and 'guide' have the same meaning. In the 'Sui Xiang Zhuan,' 'The gentleman thereby retires to rest in the evening.'… 'Banquet' means 'peace,' and 'peace' and 'rest' have the same meaning…" Examples include: roads, obstruction, residence, dispersal, fatigue, inversion, guests, fear, and collapse.</p>
<p>There are also two words with the same meaning that, when combined into one word, either retain their meaning or have their meaning changed. For example, the word 目 (mu), can mean eyes, as in "clear and cool eyes"; it can also mean the main point, as in the "Transmission of the Lamp" "To study Chan, one must make great use of the eyes in response to the moment."</p>
<p>(II) Similar Meaning—Combining two words with similar meanings into one word can be divided into two categories: one in which, after being combined into one word, the meaning includes both of the similar meanings; the other in which, after becoming one word, the meaning has changed.</p>
<p>Examples of the former include: poetry and song, ballads, appearance, etiquette, rules, laws, and banquets.</p>
<p>Examples of the latter include: firewood and rice, referring to daily necessities; pen and ink, referring to poetry; Zhu and Mo, referring to things needed for writing; paper and pen, referring to contracts; clothing and hats, which can refer to officials; crowns and tassels, which can refer to the ruler; strings and bamboo, referring to music; shields and spears, referring to war; wood and stone, referring to things without awareness ("Mencius," "Living with wood and stone.") (The above examples are what is called "synecdoche" in rhetoric.)</p>
<p>(III) Opposite Meaning—Examples include: big and small, left and right, good and bad, male and female, buying and selling, lending, victory and defeat, much and little, reward and punishment, yin and yang, deep and shallow, life and death, long and short. This type can also be divided into two categories: one includes both meanings, and the other changes the meaning. However, even the category that includes both meanings has a slight change in meaning. For example, "Decide a victory or defeat" can be interpreted as deciding whether you lose and I win, or I lose and you win; it can also be interpreted as fighting a battle. For example, "Return several taels of gold and several dozen samples, be they many or few, to the teacher," "many or few" can be interpreted as "however many taels…" or it can be interpreted as "a total of several taels…"</p>
<p>The latter category includes examples such as "A decisive showdown," which means a decisive victory or defeat. "If something long or short happens" means if a person has a "three longs and two shorts" (i.e., death). "I just want to borrow from a friend" here only means to borrow, not to lend. "Now is a moment of survival or extinction," which means when about to perish. "Go through a crisis" means it is a time of emergency.</p>
<p>Here, there is another type of formation, where the meanings of the two words being combined are neither similar nor opposite, but rather opposing. Examples include: east and west, rules, water and fire, father and son. After being combined, the meaning has completely changed. "Unable to distinguish east and west" means not knowing the direction (east and west can also be interpreted as "things"). "Not understanding rules" means the rules have become etiquette. Water and fire refer to "the mutual restraint of things," and father and son "contain the meaning of succession."</p>
<p>(IV) Reduplicated Words—Examples include: papa, mama, older brother, younger brother, wife, grandma, gradually, often, only, frequently, haha, playing, walking, sitting, everyday, just now. The first line of the first poem in the "Book of Songs" ("Guan Guan cry the ospreys") is an example. Li Qingzhao's "Sheng Sheng Man" contains the famous examples of "searching, searching, seeking, seeking, cold, cold, clear, clear, miserable, miserable, sorrowful, sorrowful, grieved, grieved."</p>
<p>(V) Due to Alliteration—Examples include: seemingly, hesitation, displacement, mountains and rivers, melancholy, ancient and modern, addition and subtraction, rules, yin and yang.</p>
<p>(VI) Due to Rhyme—Examples include: wandering, confused, absurd, hazy, leisurely, graceful, vague, water and fire, old and young, good and ugly.</p>
<p>There are many examples of the fifth and sixth categories. (Regarding words formed due to sound and rhyme, there is one point that should be mentioned in passing: Zhang Taiyan's "One Character Heavy Sound Theory." "For example, 'shuo jiao' in the ren radical has 'jiao yao,' yao is the original character, and jiao is the borrowed sound character; why not also create qiao? This shows that the character yao also has the two sounds of jiao and yao.")</p>
<p>(VII) Category Name Plus Distinguishing Word—A category name plus a distinguishing word can be divided into two categories: one, above the category name; two, below the category name.</p>
<p>Examples of the former include: scientist, writer, warlord, academic bully, dictionary, thesaurus, banknotes, pawn tickets, big dog, small dog, chartered rickshaw puller, car driver, white horse, black horse.</p>
<p>Examples of the latter include: tears, eyeballs, electric light, telephone, girls' school, female doctor, essay, literature.</p>
<p>(VIII) Original Word Plus Initial or Terminal Particle—Adding an initial particle, such as agong (grandfather), apo (grandmother), ashū (uncle), azie (older sister), ayi (aunt), or lao xiong (old brother), lao bo (old uncle), lao da (oldest), lao er (second oldest), lao Zhang (old Zhang), lao Wang (old Wang).</p>
<p>Adding a terminal particle, such as chuangzi (window), kuzi (pants), dianzi (cushion), daozi (knife), shanzi (fan), zhuozi (table), erzi (son), nuzi (daughter), qizi (wife). Also, such as ping'er (bottle), pen'er (basin), niao'er (bird), yaozi'er (to ask for money), hai'er (child) (there are many terminal particles using "er" in Hangzhou dialect). Also, such as mutou (wood), quantou (fist), bitou (nose, also called bizi), dingtou (nail head, also called dingzi), zhitou (paper), guantou (can), niutou (button).</p>
<p>(IX) Street Slang and Suffixes—This is similar to but different from the seventh and eighth categories. Prefixes, such as anti-revolution, anti-Semitism, not comprehensive, not prosperous. Suffixes, such as idealization, scientification, generality, necessity.</p>
<p>Regarding the formation of words, it can roughly be divided into the above nine categories.</p>
<p>Here, there are also a few miscellaneous points that I will try to write down.</p>
<p>The reduplicated words in the fourth category mentioned above can be reduplicated into four "characters," such as nannan nü nü (men and women), mingming baibai (clearly and plainly), hucong mangmang (hurriedly), lulu xùxù (continuously), hehe qiqi (harmoniously), tuntun tutu (hesitantly), laolao xiaoxiao (old and young).</p>
<p>There is a kind of so-called "supplementary explanation," as described by Wang Zhong in "Shuxue," "Releasing Three Nines," such as three appointments, three dismissals, three battles, three victories, nine deaths, nine oxen, nine lands, nine heavens. Also, such as four seas, ten directions, full marks, everything.</p>
<p>The above is just something written down casually; of course, I plan to write about it in more detail in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Evening <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>In any season, I often love the evening the most. People probably all love the morning: when you are still wearing soft pajamas, standing in front of the window with a sleepy expression, facing the bright sky, watching one or two thin clouds floating lazily past, or watching three or five small birds flying gracefully in the morning breeze, that is truly the most leisurely thing. If you wake up from a dream, look at patches of azure sky through the cracks in the curtains, and listen to the vague sounds of the city coming from afar, then reach for a favorite book by the pillow to read, or hum a favorite song idly, you will definitely experience a lot of fun in between. However, for those of us who bear the burden of life, where would we have such leisurely days? Every day, we just hope to get through the day quickly, letting the burden of life carry us and squeeze ourselves under the giant wheel of life. Only in the evening do we give ourselves a sigh of relief, sit lazily in my chair, watch the branches outside the window being blown by the evening breeze, watch the setting sun hanging on the corner of the wall, and indulge in a few comfortable breaths. All dreams of hope also float up at this time, and we get a little self-deprecating comfort for the burden of life.</p>
<p>Speaking of evening, I love the times of summer and autumn. The summer evening is especially beautiful, it is so refreshing and gorgeous that it makes people feel cool and brilliant. When you wear a light, thin shirt, stand under the shade of a tree, or by a short fence, and let the evening breeze play with your short hair and the corners of your clothes, that is much cooler than sitting in a cafe eating shaved ice. And there is also the blue sky, with the clouds dyed by the setting sun, the bright colors and the changing postures, watching them gives a gentle pleasure. At this time, no matter what sorrow or joy is forgotten, I often think that only nature is the most beautiful. As for the autumn evening, I love its tranquil colors and the slightly sad atmosphere. It makes people easily think of the past and leisurely bring up many longings. At this time, I sit in my chair, sighing, as if blowing away the burdens of the day's life, silently looking at the faint sky, watching flocks of birds skimming diagonally past my window.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Rain <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Libo</p>
<p>Many people love rain. "Night Rain Xiao Xiang" has become a famous line from ancient times, "Rain hitting plantain leaves" is also said to evoke a clear and poignant parting sentiment, "Rain washing pear blossoms" can even make people imagine the tragic beauty of "pear blossoms with rain," and "under the rainy window" has indeed become a blessed land for many pure and lofty people.</p>
<p>But I deeply detest rain. Rain is the most unfeeling thing. It dampens the light, diminishes the strength of the flowering branches, and further isolates the roads of human interaction. It is like pouring tears, but these tears are devoid of affection, coldly without a trace of warmth or saltiness; they are not human.</p>
<p>Every night, when I am bitten awake by bedbugs, I feel cold and disgusted when I hear the sound of rain. I turn on the light, but immediately turn it off again; I originally wanted to get up and catch a few bedbugs, but because I hate to see the rain, I don't catch the bedbugs either. I think, bedbugs make people disgusted, but they still know human blood; and they openly risk death to be the enemy of humanity, and they still have the courage to live. Being bitten by them, being unable to sleep because of it, is better than watching the color of rain.</p>
<p>The rain falls bleakly, hitting the small window. I remember just now when I turned on the light, I glanced and saw that the white window curtains were wet from the leak in the roof, and tomorrow, a yellow stain will be left on the wet area. Then, I thought in a roundabout way about the countless swollen corpses on the turbid waters of a dozen provinces.</p>
<p>Rain is hateful. But it is so insensitive that it doesn't even realize that it is hated, and it keeps dripping incessantly, dripping on the roof, floating on the windowsill, making a chirping, shameless sound.</p>
<p>Even snow and ice are good; snow has whiteness, and ice has piercing coldness, both are better than tepid rain. As soon as a person gets wet in the rain, they can only feel endless mustiness.</p>
<p>"But rain is indispensable. Rain is a necessity of daily life."</p>
<p>Precisely because it is a necessity of daily life, it only has this function, and nothing else, which makes it even more annoying! People don't just spend their daily lives.</p>
<p>If someone asks: There is a crown inlaid with luminous jewels, but wearing it requires enduring a month of torrential rain, and there is a fierce fire, a raging volcano, and in the mountain there is a ring that was worn by a beautiful woman who was burned to death and that cannot be melted by the fire, which do you want, to wear the crown in the rain or to take the ring in the fire? I say, go get the woman's ring, get it and be a dead woman's man forever, or fail to get it and be burned to ashes because of it, either is better than watching the gray raindrops in the tepid, loveless, and hateful daily life.</p>
<p>That's how much I detest rain and people who love rain, and I love the sun and men and women who love the sun with the same intense degree.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Love (I) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— By S. Sergeiev-Tsensky, translated by Su Ming</p>
<p>S. Sergeiev-Tsensky was born in 1876 and began his literary career at the age of 28. After ten years of literary activity, he fell silent. He did not reappear in the literary world until 1923, when he published his long novel "Transfiguration." During the revolution, he lived in seclusion in the Crimea. He was often isolated from people in the literary world. Critics and readers praised him, and Gorky even called his "Transfiguration" one of the greatest Russian novels of the 20th century. In the current Soviet literary scene, he is not a progressive or active writer. But his works had already earned the praise of many critics and readers before the revolution, and Gorky even called his "Transfiguration" one of the greatest Russian novels of the 20th century. His style is characterized by rich vocabulary and beautiful rhetoric, and he is an excellent stylist. In terms of themes, he is quite similar to Andreyev and Artzybashev, often using death, the cruelty of fate, personal loneliness, and morbid psychological states as his main themes. But in the essay translated here, although the manipulation of fate and the psychology of personal loneliness can also be seen, it already shines with another kind of light. —Note</p>
<p>This was in 1925.</p>
<p>On a large Siberian river flowing into the Arctic Ocean, there was the village of Spassk. There, a young new teacher, recently arrived from Vyatka, was being eagerly stared at by the nineteen-year-old Savaka. Coward—from a small house not far from the school.</p>
<p>The new teacher liked to laugh loudly. On the whole, she was lively, cheerful, and pretty. Her bright red hat suited her black curly hair hanging by her ears very well. When the simple Siberians asked her in the street what her name was, she shook her curly hair and replied, "I—Alyosha."</p>
<p>"What—Alyosha? That's a boy's name," these farmers said, shrugging their broad shoulders.</p>
<p>"That's my name. If you call me Alina, I won't answer, let alone call me Ivanovna."</p>
<p>They called her Alyosha.</p>
<p>When Savaka saw her on the street, he not only began to stare at her eagerly, but also stared at himself eagerly. He did something he had never done before: he examined himself in a mirror.</p>
<p>His face was a very ordinary face. His cheeks were broad and flat, as if they had been slightly ironed. His gray eyes looked out stubbornly from under his eyebrows, and no matter how hard he tried to make them attractive and affectionate, they always looked like two wolves seeing a stranger in their den.</p>
<p>Every day Alyosha passed his small house on her way back from school. One day he plucked up the courage to tell her, moving his lips slowly: "I am—a carpenter. I learned it from my father, he was a good carpenter. But I myself am not that unskilled with mahogany."</p>
<p>"Huh, you yourself are like wood," Alyosha laughed. "Do you want me to ask you to make a dressing mirror out of mahogany, or something else? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"The advantage is in the work, not in the dressing mirror," Savaka muttered. "It's in you and me."</p>
<p>"What are you saying! In you and me! And who are you? What's your name?"</p>
<p>"My name is Coward," Savaka said, blushing, "but that's not important."</p>
<p>"Coward? What a name!" Alyosha shook her curly hair.</p>
<p>"But that's not important," Savaka replied stubbornly, and then added very softly and wonderfully, "I have fallen in love with you."</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3 id="e222">Flower Selection to Aid Disaster Relief <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Currently, the Shanghai Charity Performing Arts Festival issued a notice to fellow citizens, saying that Shanghai's ten-mile foreign concession is filled with lights and wine, and seeing the crowds at various performing arts venues and the crowded entrances and exits of cinemas, it is known that our Shanghai compatriots are not completely incapable of saving the disaster victims. Therefore, a Charity Performing Arts Festival is specially held. It is said that this "righteous act" can not only be used to entertain the body and mind, but also benefit the disaster victims, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are many things that "combine both goods," especially the things under "lights and wine" in Shanghai can be said to be endless. Therefore, in addition to the Performing Arts Festival, there is also the so-called "Flower Selection for Disaster Relief." The ranks of the flower selection include the President, Vice President, Premier, President of the Senate, President of the House of Representatives, and even the Ministers and Vice Ministers of the six departments of beauty, talent, character, and art. Indeed, the number of disaster victims this year and the misery of the situation are such that as long as one has a little compassion, one should show great mercy, not to mention the spirit of treating all people as brothers and sisters, and the fate of the country and the people. However, this good deed has reached the point where it has to be promoted through "flower selection," which makes us on the one hand feel the hard work of the disaster relief officials in planning, and on the other hand feel the lamentable state of the Chinese people's hearts and the pity of economic fatigue.</p>
<p>Why? First, in recent years, our country has been suffering from economic depression and rural bankruptcy, but this has created opportunities for some people to get rich. Therefore, we cannot deny that the current social situation is developing abnormally to a very serious extent. Therefore, when disasters come, many people want to donate generously but have no money to donate, and the so-called some people cannot see the so-called wailing of the disaster victims all over the country. The righteous act of disaster relief has to be sought from the romantic people who frequent brothels when electing the Flower Country President, hoping that they will show compassion during the romantic events, which is a reflection of this situation.</p>
<p>Secondly, people's hearts are extravagant and morality is declining. These phenomena have recently been used by general "defenders of morality" as good topics for "hating the new tide and advocating ancient rituals." Needless to say, the relocation of prostitutes has been greatly prohibited, and even men and women going to school or swimming together have been banned in various places. However, there are not a few of these seemingly moral people who are mixed in the flower bushes. From the promotion of the righteous act of disaster relief to the election of the Flower Country President, it shows what the hearts of those who are concerned about the world are like, and what their "hating the new tide and advocating ancient rituals" is all about.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Geese Returning to the Grass <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>The sunlight shone weakly and feebly on the fields, and it was autumn again. In the distance, on the top of the small mountain across the way, just like the end of last winter, clumps of withered yellow and empty clouds floated around. Those things, like a collection of a kind of depressed atmosphere, condensed in the wilderness and the frighteningly high autumn sky, stubbornly and thickly, refusing to dissipate. At this time, people gradually felt more depressed and gloomy day by day from their previous cheerful mood, and from this they understood that autumn was indeed coming back without any remedy.</p>
<p>At dusk, in the reflection of the setting sun, flocks of geese flew from the north, foretelling a difficult and severe winter ahead. People know this, people have lived through one cruel winter after another, people are familiar with it!</p>
<p>With a deep and mournful cry, the porch of the old house also became gloomy: an old man rested in the broken sunlight, silently smoking, wisps of smoke rising into the air, in the silence, as if thinking about something that he would never understand. Under the eaves, there were still two or three old swallows' nests, but now, a terrible season was coming, the swallows had gone far away, and these dilapidated nests that were left behind also seemed so desolate!</p>
<p>I still remember clearly, in the spring, the roaring and lively season, when the swallows came from the south, the weather was good, and a clear sky for a day ensured that there would be no more wind or rain, and people in a slight but pleasant melancholy, could vaguely remember Yan Shu's lines: "There is nothing to be done about the flowers falling away, but the swallows returning seem to know each other."</p>
<p>But now, it is no longer the swallows that are returning, but flocks of geese.</p>
<p>The fields are still covered with scattered and weak sunlight, and the hometown, when I think about it, should also appear equally desolate, gentle, and pitiful, right? For a life as small as breadcrumbs, drifting aimlessly outside year after year (thousands of miles away!), like hard-working swallows and lonely geese, when night comes, in the deep black days, what is encountered is only the faint dream of a "seemingly familiar" homeland.</p>
<p>Autumn is passing day by day, just like the pages of a book are turned page by page—those withered yellow pages, and what exactly is recorded in them? Are they withered autumn sun and fallen leaves, and the mournful chirping of insects night after night?</p>
<p>The flocks of geese are returning to the south, having gone through such an amazing long journey, crossing such long wilderness and huge rivers, for the sake of merely trying to obtain a little warmer air. Yes, the efforts of such small animals are amazing and admirable, but what about humans, who are called the spirit of all things...?</p>
<p>Drifting, one by one, there are so many, and the cold season is foretelling its arrival, but they are still living in complacency; for the hometown, the warm hometown, it is still some empty and sad memories that are almost hard to believe.</p>
<p>Saying that, it is foolish and cowardly, right?</p>
<p>I once sighed at the departure of the swallows, and now I am feeling the return of the geese—tomorrow's: in such sighs, ordinary time will eventually pass by ordinarily, and silver-white stars will be added to my sideburns.</p>
<p>Come, all withered and cold things, just follow the geese without hesitation! My heart is indifferent and empty, and they can go inside and live.</p>
<p>Yes, the geese are back! It is the autumn of the south, with piles of clouds, an empty Milky Way, a lonely sea, a withered autumn sun... In short, the geese are back.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Night of June <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Yago</p>
<p>The night of June is melancholic. Inside this small thatched cottage, it is so quiet, and I cannot help but feel a sense of emptiness in my heart.</p>
<p>The bright moon in the sky shines obliquely on this lush wilderness, casting a milky white silver light, turning the sleeping fields and forests into a silver and beautiful painting.</p>
<p>Although there is no modern clock here, the distant sound of the night watchman’s clapper already announces the third watch. The heat makes me restless and unable to sleep, so I lie awake, lost in reverie.</p>
<p>A mournful cry suddenly arose from somewhere unknown. With curiosity, I quietly listened, but it slowly weakened and subsided. From then on, within no more than five minutes, I heard the same terrifying howl, sometimes so faint, and sometimes bright again.</p>
<p>"Is it the howl of a night wolf? Or a tiger's roar!" But I listened carefully, and it didn't sound like either.</p>
<p>So I got out of bed, found a pair of shoes to wear on the ground, grabbed a black gun from the wall rack with trembling hands, without even checking if it was loaded with gunpowder, and tiptoed out of the door with light steps.</p>
<p>The wilderness unfolded its shadows expansively, revealing a dull tranquility. Dogs curled up under the shade of trees, their strong necks tucked in. The howling subsided, and the evening breeze from the fields sent shivers.</p>
<p>I paced back and forth on the threshing ground with light steps, feeling a sudden sense of anxiety and emptiness in my heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sharp howl came again, and it seemed that I could vaguely hear a final, almost sobbing sound from a woman: "It's bitter!..." The village dogs woke up from their dreams, jumping up as if suddenly struck by a knife, sniffing, raising their heads high, and barking loudly, "Woof! Woof! Woof!"</p>
<p>My nerves began to tremble, and my forehead was damp and prickly with sweat. My hair felt like it was about to</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>stand on end, and I felt a spasm like a malarial patient throughout my body. A terrible thought quickly seized me, making me want to run back into the house regardless. But, after all, I didn't do that. I remembered that I had brought a weapon, and I became bolder.</p>
<p>A force, I don't know when it arose, was bewitching me, so I went straight to the place where the howling was coming from.</p>
<p>Passing through patches of lush green fields, I quietly advanced, my active heart filled with tension and curiosity.</p>
<p>The distant forest, like a lush mountain range, under the silvery sky, reflected shimmering, quivering light.</p>
<p>From the village to this forest, there was originally a wide and open road, with two clear streams flanking the road on both sides. These two streams originated from the mountains and flowed through the fields of the Thirty-Six Villages into the sea. In the past, this stream was regarded as the lifeline of the farmers in the Thirty-Six Villages. When the weather was hot, young people would gather in groups to bathe and frolic here, stripping naked, talking and laughing wantonly, and flirting. The village girls also often took advantage of the market days, using the pretext of washing clothes, to mingle with the young men here.</p>
<p>But in recent years, disasters have occurred everywhere, and this lifeline of the Thirty-Six Villages has been constantly plagued by drowning incidents of persecuted men and women, or hangings on the trees beside the stream, and it has been regarded as a dangerous place. The villagers believe that it is haunted by ghosts and no longer see it as so lovely.</p>
<p>I walked stealthily, and suddenly, under a cluster of trees by the stream, I discovered a blurry shadow wriggling there. Looking closely! I could vaguely recognize that there were three people in total, apparently two men and one woman. The two men were dressed as farmers, dragging and seizing a woman with disheveled hair and tattered clothes, trying to drag her into the forest. The woman desperately clung to a tree root, refusing to go in, sobbing.</p>
<p>I silently thought to myself, "This must be an affair or unwarranted persecution!" I couldn't help but feel angry, and I tightened my grip on the gun, wanting to shout loudly, but when I remembered that the bird gun I had brought was not loaded with gunpowder, I couldn't help but feel flustered, not knowing what I should do: chase after them! Or go back to the village and call for help? I was confused for a moment, unable to decide. But when I calmed myself down for a while and looked at the three characters playing out the tragedy by the stream, they had already run away without a trace, I don't know when.</p>
<p>I felt a sense of depression in my heart and returned to the village.</p>
<p>The next morning, someone went up the mountain to cut firewood and found a strangled female corpse in the stream, but no one knew her name or where she was from.</p>
<p>Less than two months after this incident, an old man, about fifty or sixty years old, with gray hair, came to the village. He was wearing ragged clothes, a bamboo hat, and carrying a bundle on his back. He held aloft a white paper flag with two large characters crookedly written on it: "Seeking Person." He beat a broken gong, calling out in a miserable tone, "Kindhearted and generous people, has anyone seen my Yun'er..." He choked up before he could finish speaking.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Grassroots Work <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<h3 id="e226">Miners <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yefe</p>
<p>Recently, on the slopes of Huangye Ridge, one can no longer hear the majestic "Miner's Song," but only a string of sighs and curses. The reason is that wages have not been paid for two months.</p>
<p>Other things are not a big deal, but it is the hard-working miners who sweat and bleed who suffer. They all work one day and eat one day. How can you not pay them their wages for several months in a row? So their lives are in panic——</p>
<p>"Damn it, they haven't paid wages for three months. Do they want us to eat coal dust?" A'gou said angrily, taking a break from the winch, wringing the corner of his torn clothes to wipe away sweat. Yinbao glanced at him sympathetically, sighed, and walked from beside the winch to the outside of the shed, inhaling a pipe of tobacco. But his empty stomach remained empty.</p>
<p>"Really, when Shanghai can remit money down, when wages can be paid, those are all lies!" Jinlong couldn't help but interject, roaring, "Lao Er, let's go find the accountant and ask them to calculate our wages. We don't want to work anymore. Anyway, working is starving, not working is also starving. I'd rather starve to death in my hometown..."</p>
<p>"You can't talk like that. What's the use of being irritable? So, we don't work, where else can we go? Isn't it the same everywhere! Don't you see that factories are all laying off workers, reducing wages, and the number of unemployed comrades is increasing day by day? People can't even find a place to work for free. We need to survive now, so we have to endure our temper and work. There's no way around it. In short, blame ourselves for being born into such a world!" Lao Er's voice was already trembling when he said this, but his eyes were almost bursting with blood. However, he finally changed his tone and comforted him, "Although they owe us several months' wages, they will eventually calculate and repay us."</p>
<p>Although Lao Er was comforting them like this, how could he not be angry in his own heart? But what could he do? Several times he went to the accountant to calculate the wages, and he always replied that the general manager had not returned, or that the money remitted from Shanghai was about to arrive that day. But waiting left and right, when a sum of money was remitted, they arranged it for themselves first. How could the workers' share be reached!</p>
<p>Everyone was silent, not saying a word. The surroundings were filled with a tragic atmosphere. A large group of more than fifty people were all squeezed under a not very large reed mat shed. Large piles of coal dust, like small earthen mounds, squatted beside the open space, emitting puffs of gas.</p>
<p>The lever workers, however, were sending coal to the coal storehouse one batch after another——</p>
<p>"They are big bosses, we are workers. Workers eat one day at a time. The whole family has to live. How can they not pay wages for one or two months? What is this?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe what ghosts they are up to. They can't even pay wages, and they still want to run some kind of coal mine?"</p>
<p>"……"</p>
<p>Dang—dang—dang—dang—dang—dang—</p>
<p>The iron plate above the mine sounded, so this group of them swarmed onto the winch, grabbed the levers and turned, turned, lowered one empty bucket after another, and hoisted up buckets of muddy water.</p>
<p>"Ai..." Such a long call echoed in the mine shaft, and the sound waves were very distant and blurry.</p>
<p>"Oh..." The response came from above.</p>
<p>"One zhang seven chi of material section——" The following sentence was climbed up again, so a one zhang seven chi Maosong tree was hung from the bucket. The mine shaft is fifteen or sixteen zhang deep from the ground, and the space in the hole is about four or five zhang wide. More than twenty miners are all working inside; there are five or six carpenter workers, who specialize in managing the splint, scaffolding, and piling. The board jumps are supported at the waist, and people work back and forth on the boards, all in water underneath. There is no air, no light, and the earth gas and a kind of soil moisture suffocate people's brains, almost exploding, but they have to live, so they have to forcibly endure. Although one or two companions always fall ill and are carried back every day, they also pretend not to see it!</p>
<p>Because of less money and smaller scope, many places all adopt local methods, without complete mechanization, so not only does it cost more labor and effort, but also the coal production is very slow.</p>
<p>"Ji—ji—ji—" The dismissal bell rang, so some of them put down from the winch, and some were lifted up from the mine hole, patted the coal dust off their bodies, and dragged their limbs, tired from hunger and hardship, out of the door of the mine house, but everyone's face was melancholy, and there was not a trace of joy. Everyone just lowered their heads and walked silently towards the way home; people, like a group of prisoners released from prison, seemed to be discussing among themselves whether they could get the price of everyone's hard work tomorrow.</p>

<p>Opening "Zhaojun"</p>
<p>The north wind howls, rolling yellow sand. Zhaojun's departure from the border is as beautiful as a flower. Emperor Liu of the Han Dynasty graciously bestows three cups of wine. She shouts "Long live" three times to thank the emperor. She bids farewell to the Empress Dowager in the palace. In the Jin Yan Hall, she bids farewell to her parents. Weeping and crying, she exits the imperial city. Civil and military officials escort her with a green gauze curtain. Pitiful civil officials who hold pens to pacify the world. Military generals who wield swords to secure the country. Civil and military schemes are clever and resourceful. Why use us to pacify the barbarians? The lady is resenting in her heart. She is unwilling to hold the pipa. Gritting her teeth, Mao Yanshou. He shouldn't have drawn her portrait to offer to the barbarians. Luckily, the Imperial Brother Wang Long came to persuade her. The groom adds the whip behind. See, a group of Tartars flashing out of the woods. Listen to them shouting in their mouths. Command to open the pass to welcome the lady. I am, unable to see the imperial city when looking back. Regretting that my beauty is not suitable. Red face and thin life, it is true.</p>

<p>Opening "Consort Drunk"</p>
<p>The Western Palace is quiet at night, fragrant with flowers. She wants to roll up the pearl curtain, her spring hatred is long. The Consort sits alone on the agarwood couch. Burning red candles to await the emperor. Gao Lishi, inform the lady. Saying, tonight, the emperor is in Zhaoyang. Yu Huan hears this and adds to her sorrow. Softly she leaves to remove her palace makeup. She sleeps on the dragon bed. Short sighs and long sighs, tears in two lines. Seeing, a round of bright moon shining on the palace wall. So many palace maids are beautiful. Why do you leave me aside? The quilt is cold. The pillow is cold. Thinking of a dream. The emperor is also a fickle man. Advise people not to accompany the emperor. Accompanying the emperor is like accompanying a tiger. It is better to marry a romantic man. Enjoying happy times day and night. Purple micro flowers facing purple micro man.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Sketch of New Era Characters <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— (Tomorrow)</p>
<p>Five, the name Huang Naishuang is very hot, not because she has a similar name with Huang Liushuang, the soulless daughter who fell into a foreign land. As early as four years ago, the Chinese film industry discovered a miracle. The first sound film "After the Rain" appeared very novelly. In fact, the miracle was not this sound film, but the beauty of the heroine Ms. Huang Naishuang in this sound film. Indeed, many fans were fascinated by her slender body and charming face. Unfortunately, after that, she ran to the other side to perform a more realistic drama of life, and had to say goodbye to her enthusiastic audience for a while. Until now, she seems to be a star that has been hidden behind the clouds for a long time, appearing brilliantly in Mr. Wang's film. We believe that Mr. Wang's film is welcomed by the broad masses, and our beautiful little girl has no power!</p>
<p>Six, the New Era Company has two "great men": one is the fat and short Wang Shimu, and the other is the thin and tall Mrs. Chen. Chen Mu is named Zhai Qiqi. She has a gentle temperament, elegant conversation, and broad life experience. She can be a politician, or a virtuous wife and good mother in the family, but she is not interested in those. She resolutely devoted herself to the film industry. She often said that art is a weapon to create a bright society, and she will use the weapon of art to fight against the dark forces in front of her. This spirit is admirable. We wish Ms. Zhai a successful fight.</p>
<p>Seven, everyone still remembers, not long ago, a world's fattest woman came to Shanghai to perform, temporarily satisfying the novelty of Shanghai people. In fact, this is not surprising. If everyone pays attention to the fat appearance of Wang Shimu in Ye Qianyu's cartoon Mr. Wang, then the world's fattest woman would not be so worthy of people's amazement. Of course, this is a cartoon, and people can draw it as fat as they want, but the strange thing followed. When the New Era Film Company was established, to find a female character as fat as Wang Shimu in the cartoon, everyone thought it was impossible, but the day after the advertisement was published, a strange visitor suddenly came to the company. This visitor was Ms. Sang Shuzhen, who later played Wang Shimu in Mr. Wang's film. Her fat appearance does not need my introduction. Everyone must have seen it on the screen. Not only does her identity meet the needs of the characters in the play, but her performance is also very good. This time, when she went to Suzhou to shoot on location, her two big and fat arms were tanned like two purplish-red Jinhua hams. In the play, Mr. Wang was crying loudly that he had no food to eat, Zuo Ming pointed to Wang Shimu's two big fat arms and said: "Why don't you cook these two big hams to eat?" After saying that, everyone couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<h3 id="e232">"Fishing and Killing Home" on the Screen <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Play within a Play in "Parents and Children"</p>
<p>"Fishing and Killing Home" is a famous historical drama known to women and children in our country. It has now been moved to the screen in the sound film "Parents and Children" by the Culture Film Company, starring Ms. Min Cuiying, a famous amateur actor in Shanghai. Yesterday, a large group of people from the Culture Company - directors, actors, etc., more than 30 people, drove to Wusong to shoot "Fishing and Killing Home". It is a real mountain and real water, with picturesque scenery, a flat boat, white waves soaring into the sky, father and daughter paddling, and both male and female actors wearing specially made ancient costumes, which are full of ancient charm and flavor. In the play, Xiao En and Ding Fu's teacher and apprentice, etc., fought fiercely in the water for eight hours, performing passionately and enthusiastically, which was exciting. Ms. Min Cuiying also sang the "Fisherman's Tears" in the boat, which was colorful and like icing on the cake. The move of "Fishing and Killing Home" to the screen has been prepared by the Culture Company for three or four months. Performed by Ms. Min Cuiying, the pioneer of improving national opera, it is truly an unprecedented initiative on the Chinese stage and screen.</p>

<p>Zhang Shichuan is preparing for the new work "Peach Blossom After the Calamity" after "Big Family⑥", and Li Pingqian is actively shooting "Love Letter". Yesterday, he convened the actors and staff of the two dramas in the Star Director Department to explain the plot.</p>
<p>After Xia Peizhen completed "Difficult Sisters and Difficult Brothers" by Jixing, she immediately took the lead role in a sound film at the Happy Forest. Now it is said that the central government intends to invite her to shoot a play, which will be produced in Shanghai. At the same time, Xi Jianong, Li Junpan, and Gao Yian are also invited.</p>
<p>The cartoon hygiene film "Resistance" and several other cartoons were specially screened at the Central Health Administration on Monday of last week to commemorate the anniversary. There were many viewers, and all the viewers praised it. The cartoon is the masterpiece of the Wan Brothers, the only cartoonist in China, and it is also the product of the Star Company.</p>
<p>The memorial service for Zheng Zhengqiu was initiated by various groups and is scheduled to be held at Lake Society on Beijing Road on the 25th. It is now heard that Zheng Xiaoqiu also wants to hold a memorial service for his father. It is said that obituaries have been distributed these days.</p>
<p>The Star Tennis Team has now been formally established. Hu Die, Gu Lanjun, Wang Zhengxin, Gong Jianong, Wang Shizhen, He Maogang, He Zhaohuang, He Zhaozhang, etc. are all basic members. If you want to make a friendly match, you can directly send a letter to He Maogang of the Tennis Team of Star Company at Fenglin Bridge.</p>
<p>The New Light Theater is now preparing to start showing films recently. It is said that the first one will be the sound film "Big Family" produced by the Star Company with all the actors, or the full sound "Night Fragrance" starring Hu Die.</p>
