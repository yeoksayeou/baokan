<h3>海軍會議前途之暗礁</h3>
<p>— 記</p>
<p>倫敦海縮會議自本年三四月以來即有進行復活之消息迨五月中旬英德海軍協定正式成立德國保有英國海軍百分之三五之此例為英國所接受而英國前此所堅持之海軍比率主義亦自動宣告廢棄於是英日意見日趨接近海軍會議復活之聲浪亦因是而高漲頃摟倫敦方面消息英國政府已於本月三日至八日之間通告美日法意四國大使建議在十月間召集非正式海軍會議以籌備將來之正式會議無會內容且提議兩點「廢棄海軍比率制」放棄前此總噸數的限制之主張而代以質的限制之協議英國此項公文雖非正式請書但吾人就華盛頓海軍條約內規定於締約國中一國發出廢棄通告書之一年內垂體協約國應召集第二次海軍會議另訂新約之倏欽加以推惻則再度召集海軍會議文說似信而有微矣</p>
<p>目下吾人所欲論列者一為現階段海軍會議之性質其次則為前途之暗礁先就性質問題言目前海軍會議因受英德海軍協定之形響盤形複雜去年倫敦海縮預備會議進行之際其討論範圍以太平洋問題為中心而以英美日三國為全體規則波羅的海北海與地中海之海軍間題共情形似較太平洋問題更為嚴重關係國家實須包含英法德意美俄諸國在內目前英國對海軍問題之重心似亦在歐洲且歐洲海軍問題與太平洋海軍問題之聯系更使整個海軍軍縮問題形成不可分解之矛盾矣</p>
<p>次就前途之暗礁而言殊報難關重重舉其大者言之「廢除比率制之主張英日兩國見解雖屬一致但日本以國防安全威為其基本原則對英國所堅持之規定各級軍艦噸戰及砲徑之最大限度之提議頗　之以冷淡其次英國為維持歐洲和平機構力主海軍會議應邀穗俄參加此層已為日本政府所反對至英國所提出之建艦通告原則日本反認為事實上無此必要」美國對海軍會議問題頗持審慎觀望之態度而賞質上其保持五五三海軍比率之原則仿一秉初衷美大海軍主義者文生氏曾公開聲明美國今後之海軍政第為日本造艦三艘而美國必須造艦五艘若干議員且認為華盛頓海軍條約之取消於美國實有利益蓋該約中規定太平洋不添設防備之條欵將一併取消也美國此種立婆為共海軍孤立政策之表現視此情形美國縱參加海軍會議亦無非多添－番爭執而已德國海軍造艦程序之詳細訐劃頗為曖昧英法意俄諸國輿論為之皇然因之英國政府與法意俄之海軍談判亦發生暗礁法國旨在先獲得保隊北海方面法國瓣隊之安全而蘇聯則提出保障波羅的海安全之計劃以為英國宜允許於戰時尊重丹麥海峽之中立此種提議實為英國所難容納者</p>
<p>以上三者為海軍會議前途之主要暗礁必先打破此主要之暗礁而後有各國妥協成立新協定之可言不然和平談判之最後命運既已告終海軍軍備競爭之前途將益不堪設想矣</p>

<h3>意相覆電到巴黎　拒絕英法建議　力避國聯爲基礎成立恊定　對英所詢各節無明確答覆　三強代表昨下午續開會議</h3>
<p>（巴黎）今晨賴伐爾與阿洛錫之談話、已使巴黎空氣爲之不寗、意總代表今晨所接羅馬訓令、聞對於下述兩要點、殊欠明晰、（一）關於可爲討論基礎之建議、來電對之似拋置不談、而又提出切實辦法以代替之（二）關於英代表艾登欲知何者究爲意國要求之意見、來電絕未提及、法總理晤見艾登時、已將今晨　與阿洛錫交換意見之詳情、告知艾登、（十八日）路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據哈瓦斯社外交訪員探悉、意大利代表阿洛錫、今晨與總理兼外長賴伐爾會晤時、曾表示意大利政府拒絕英法兩國所提出解决意阿爭端之建議、但意國方面則並未提出對案、對於英國不管部大臣艾登所詢問各節、亦無確切答復、聞意國拒絕英法之建議、乃欲避免以國聯會爲基礎成立協定、意國所根據之理由、以爲一九〇六年條約所規定英法意三國在阿國所獲得之讓予權、本具有政治性質、故根據該約、意國當然可向阿國要求獲得政治讓予權云、英法意三國代表團、現定於午後三時三十分開會、以討論意相墨索里尼致阿洛錫之最後訓令、官塲方面對於談判前途、頗爲悲觀、蓋墨索里尼倘堅决拒絕視尊重國聯會盟約爲必要之各項建議、則此後談判究將根據何種基礎以進行、殊不可得而知矣、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）三强會議延會、以待意相墨索里尼答覆英法兩國昨日所提出解决意阿爭執之新建議後、阿案之中心、暫由巴黎移至羅馬、一般人士之目光、現咸股切注於意京、蓋菲洲之和戰、全繫於墨氏之答覆也、意總代表阿洛錫昨晚與意外交部互作電話交談、羅馬負責方面對於目前之局勢、緘默不發一詞、墨氏現正乘汽車巡閱南意被徵赴菲之黑衫隊、適不在京、聞意外交部亟欲與之接觸、俾可答覆英法之新建議、惟意京一般輿情、距樂觀甚遙、衆信巴黎會議將發一種文吿完事、於是日內瓦將遭遇難關、如國聯希圖對阿案作全盤討論、則意國或卽將對阿比西尼亞與不列顚挑戰也、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>英意互爭地中海紅海霸權</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間今日一般人深信、英法兩國要求意相墨索里尼宣布對於阿比西尼亞之最低要求、已成爲三國會議之交涉基礎、墨氏之遲遲不覆、尤足證明此事之重要、咋日會議中各代表之態度、已可見英意兩國意見之不同、其背景實爲爭奪地中海及紅海之霸權、巴黎深覺墨氏有增加控制南歐海道權力之野心、而英國所寢食不安者亦在於此、今日據最可靠方面消息、英國擬使意國明瞭蘇彝士運河對於溝通英國與印度、並不如意國理想中之重要卽使意國得控制阿國、亦不致驟然改觀、因意國在紅海及印度洋沿岸、早已有愛立德里及索馬里倫兩處屬地云、至於阿國內部之察那湖區、則因該區爲灌漑尼羅河之中心、英國已明白警吿、如意國竟欲攫取該區、則將爲對英直接衝突、惟英國亦以外交口吻聲稱、預料不致有此意外耳、歐洲消息最靈通之政論家泰蒲亞今日曾稱、艾登與賴伐爾二氏不久或將親赴羅馬、面請墨索里尼對於阿國接受經濟權利、而放棄軍事控制之野心云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>三國代表　分別舉行談話　未能打開困難局面</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　理兼外長賴伐爾、淤今晨十時與意大利代表阿洛錫舉行談話、至十一時四十五分始畢、十一時五十五分又與英國不管部大臣艾登舉行談話、至下午一點始畢、談話後、賴伐爾語人、謂談判進行頗感困難、又謂英法意三國會議下次會議、定於午後三點三十分舉行云、又美國駐法代辦馬利尼耶於今晨拜訪英國駐法大使克賴克爵士、對於意阿爭端談判進行之情形有所探詢、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）一般人相信意大利認意阿爭端係純粹意國殖民問題、故國聯會行政院若果於九月四日開會討論意阿爭端、則意國將不列席會議、關於此事、意國現尙採取保留態度、此間人士對於巴黎三國會議、目前尙抱樂觀、以爲英意兩國相反之觀點提出後、會議並未决裂、可見英國態度已較軟化、而正在探尋與一九零六年三國條約不相牴觸之各種可能解决方法云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法建議內容　願以財力助意開拓　英反對政治讓與權</h3>
<p>據法國消息靈通方面傳出最近提交羅馬之建議內容、爲就英法兩國而論、已任令阿比西尼亞開放、以供意國從事經濟的發展、此項建議乃根據一九二五年英意協定與本年法意協定製成、惟英國保留對柴那湖與尼羅河支流之權利、法國僅請保衛其在吉波蒂至阿京鐵路之權利、</p>
<p>除提交羅馬之新建議外、聞英法兩國且允以財政助力予意、以供其在阿從事經濟的發展、而成三國財政開拓之方式、艾登雖於對意之經濟的讓與權已完全同意、但英國仍反對政治的讓與權、惟法政府表露經阿王之同意、可許意國獲某項之保障、如阿國各行政部聘用意國顧問之類、聞阿國陸軍亦在其列、法國視此爲對意國的安全之一種保障、聞艾登在未接墨索里尼對英法新建議之意見前、不允贊同關於財政助力及意國顧問之建議、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）賴伐爾與艾登現正協商英法共同計劃、據消息靈通方面稱、此種計劃亦非根本解决意阿爭端之辦法、不過考慮意大利在阿國如何發展經濟之可能性、外間關於英法願借欵贊助意國開發阿國礦產之傳說、現盛極一時、並謂墨索里尼若能接受英法之經濟建議、則英法願進而討論政治保障之問題、唯意大利至今尙未宣露其意向所在、故會議不能不暫行停頓、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>意採延宕政策　英法代表漸感不耐　艾登準備束裝返國</h3>
<p>（巴黎）三國會議在墨索里尼未提出書面條件之際、實危如壘卵、據巴黎英人方面咋夜聲稱、英代表團竚候羅馬之覆電、不能遲逾兩日、在下星期中問或取此法、或取他法、必須使大局眞相畢露、未便容其長此糢糊云、咋夜巴黎英法各界之一般印象、具顯明的悲觀、法總理兼外長賴伐爾對於會議之頓挫、頗有不能忍耐之態、因其女公子已定本月二十日結婚、故雅不欲在臨此佳期之時會議頓轉危急也、巴黎廻聲報謂、英意兩國彼此試騐實力或改稱决心之形勢、現日見顯矣云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）聞英國代表團宣稱、意大利對於向阿比西尼亞所提政治性質之要求、若至下星期中旬以前、尙未提出答覆、則英國代表擬卽束裝返國、按英國不管部大臣艾登已向意國提出兩項問題、至爲明確、卽（一）對於意屬索謀里蘭及伊里特里亞之安全、（二）對於願赴阿國居住之意國僑民之安全、意國究取得何種最低限度之保證是也、英國人士對阿國威脅意國屬地之說、不信能成爲事實、至於意國人士則堅稱一九〇六年條約、規定英法意三國與阿比西尼亞間之關係、此項修約具有政治意義、實與規定瓜分阿國無異、惟意大利將在阿國享有何種政治勢力則意國人士極端緘密、絕無表示、（十七日哈瓦期電）</p>
<h3>意專家言論　引起法方驚異　謂意要求早有所宣示　法報論調漸傾向英國</h3>
<p>（巴黎）怠國大使館專家茄那賽里、代表阿洛鉅男爵接見法國新聞記者、所發言論、頗令人驚異莫名、法國總理賴伐爾曾謂、三國會議齊停進行、係因阿氏方靜待意相墨索里尼之訓令、而茄氏則稱彼並不希望有何訓令、且亦未曾有此請求、茄氏對於三國會議純粹法律性質之問題、或一一作答、惟對於有關意國要求之問題、則忽稱早已登載意國報紙、故此間新聞界咸以爲茄氏大槪已得羅馬之訓示、以致法國報紙益形不耐、而漸露傾向英國之論調、如某報謂、「吾人亦知墨索里尼之要求、自有理由、惟爲擁護國聯之原則起見、不得不贊助英國、」巴黎晚報亦謂、「如墨索里尼要求以阿比西尼亞爲意國之保護國、而絕無讓可之餘地、亦宜早日聲明、墨氏或以爲倘能延宕事再三星期之久、則可利於軍事上之準備、然英法兩國所得不良之印象、恐尤有甚於此者也」云云、（十八日國民電）</p>
<h3>意相朂勵將士　向前勇進爲民族爭光榮</h3>
<p>（巴黎）聞意相仍從事秣馬厲兵、渠聞昨日在伊塞尼亞向第二十三師團一萬二千人演說時有言曰、「吾人應向前勇進、至法西斯帝國成立而後已、余知君等必以鐵的紀律各盡天職、至一切目的全達而後已」、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>意大利伊塞尼亞城　汎繫黨黨軍一隊、行將開往東菲洲、今晚首相墨索里尼親來歡送、並向黨軍發表激昂演說、謂「黨軍抵菲洲後、將爭得最光榮之勝利」、又謂「意大利將繼續奮鬭至汎繫帝國締造成功而後已」、渠深信黨軍定能以堅强不屈之精神、履行職責、到底不懈云云、首相抵此後、受民衆熱烈歡迎、將於明日在飛機塲校閱「十月二十八日」師團士兵、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>郵局簡易人壽保險　定下月內開辦　便利平民保費特低最少五十元　手續力求簡便與儲蓄閒戶相似</h3>
<p>交通部郵政儲金匯業局創辦簡易人壽保險、經立法院通過條例、並由國民政府公布、該局積極籌備以來、爲時已久、但以該項保額微細、保費須按月繳納故籌備手續、頗爲麻煩、現已大致籌備就緒、擬定於九月內開辦、該簡易　險、原爲便利平民階級、故保額與普通保險公司不同、最低五十元、最高爲五百元、保費按月繳納、甚有每月祇收大洋一角、故輕而易舉、任何人均有投保可能、蓋舉辦該項簡易人壽保險目的、乃在養成國民儲蓄習慣、其辦法力取簡便、與普通開戶儲蓄大同小異、該局爲試辦計、擬先在滬京漢三地先行開辦、如成績良好、再行推廣各地、以資普遍云、</p>
<h3>早稻略有登場　米價供求相應　麥貴粉賤麵廠吃虧　紗廠停工已達半數</h3>
<p>秋收漸近、南京廣波浦東硤石等地、新榖已略有登塲、浦東於半月間見新、寗波南京則於上星期初、相繼分批運滬、從此供求相應、靑黃啣接、米價可逐潮平衡、據米業中人觀察、今年穀稻收成、較生年可望豐裕、因夏初雖曾鬧旱、繼即雨量充足、近半月間、晚稻施肥期屆、江南河流縱橫之區、且無庸戽水、今後結穗時期、史可扶搖直上、再本年春季所訂洋米、迄今尙有一部份未銷罄、故今後米價看低、爲意料中事、惟秋收後米價看低、對農民收穫、頗有損害云、</p>
<p>麥貴粉賤麵廠受窘</p>
<p>本年夏初、新麥登塲時、麵粉廠均有欣欣向榮之氣象、斯時國內各省、亟須麵粉以補米糧之不足、故當時預料粉廠可穩渡今夏旺盛時期、奈最近兩旬來、國內外麥價上漲無定、而麵粉價格、又因米市平定、而日漸回小、（現麵祗二元四角許）致各粉廠均有難色、聞若長此下去、本月底將商議或各個自動减車云、</p>
<p>棉織紗廠停减逾半</p>
<p>至於國內紗廠、自棉貴紗賤深刻化後、因之停工或减工者、在本市已達十分之三、近一月來、雖紗花曾迭吿上漲、但棉貴紗不貴之現象、仍未稍刦、且現銷亦有限、故停减者、迄至最近已達十分之五、據某紗廠領袖表示、非至新花上塲後、看情勢如何、則决不易復工云云、並悉中國紗廠業、曾以友誼立塲、請在滬日紗廠酌减一部份時間、以免傾虬、惟日紗廠以係自紡自織者居多、致該問題至今尙在考慮、無正式答復表示允許或否云云、</p>

<h3>不景氣籠罩全市　消耗物品進口减落　其中以捲烟减落爲最鉅　婦女化妝品亦减退不少</h3>
<p>滬市素稱繁華、市民日常生活、習於奢侈、舉凡一切消耗物品、多以取給洋貨爲榮、故外來奢侈品之進口、乃以滬市爲大量消納之地、惟此年以來、不景氣籠眾全市、市民購買力日趨薄弱、洋货進口、、因以漸减、新新社記者、曾訪國際貿易局統計處專員吳道鍼君、詢以本年上半年來、洋貨消耗品進口之消長情形、承吿頗詳、</p>
<p>洋酒進口不减當年</p>
<p>據吳君談、滬埠市面蕭條各業調敝經營洋貨者、亦無利可圖、上半年洋貨進口、因以漸趨衰落、獨日常生活消耗品奢侈品、傾注滬埠、减落尙少、卽以烟酒而論、上半年滬埠輸入、近三百萬金單位、而洋酒一項、與上年相較、未見减落、上半年輸入、亦達五十九萬金單位、其中以啤酒數字最鉅、威士忌酒次之、可見滬埠人士嗜好之所向、纸烟烟卓等項、上半年進口、大爲减落、與上年同期相較、僅及百分之三十一、其中百分之九十以上、均在滬埠銷售、玫本年來烟草進口衰落之原因、或以各方提倡新生活禁吸紙烟所致、然一般消耗力之疲弱、亦爲一大原因、</p>
<p>香水脂粉均見减落</p>
<p>烟酒以外、奢侈品中、婦女化妝品、實佔有重要位置、上半年就此一項統計、僅滬埠一隅、已達三十五萬餘金單位、占總額百分之六十三、蓋全國爲五十六萬餘金單位也、其中以香水脂粉爲最多、化妝用品次之、首飾最少、香水脂粉進口、以美國居第一、法國·德國·次之、日本亦有相當數字、僅次於法國而已、本年上半年與去年上半年比較、滬埠進口减落、達十餘萬金單位足徵婦女雖愛好天然、但購買力亦臻一致疲弱之境矣、</p>
<p>無綫電汽車亦减退</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （心仁）</p>
<p>沒有一個人不想做長子，這是好的，也是壤的。菜刀可以切菜，也可以殺人，全瞧你怎麼使用。</p>
<p>俗語說：「一個和尙挑水吃，兩個和尙扛水吃，三個和尙沒水吃。　這簡簡的三句，把人類的推諉說盡了，於此也可知做大事的人常常是孤獨的。</p>
<p>人在社會裏，正如一個白亮小球滾在桌上高而夫的球盤裏，到處碰釘子，路是釘子做成的。至於這個白亮的小球碰在五千分的圓眼裏，事是打了個羅斯，那全不是因爲白亮的小球本身有什麼貴賤的分別。</p>
<p>夏天說冬天好過，冬天說夏天快樂，人就是這麼吃在嘴裏，望在鍋裏的，永不會滿足。</p>
<h3>燄口</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>畢竟上海是大地方，慈善家也特別的多，他們不止替活人想方便，而且還顧及到地下的餓鬼們，因此一年一度的盂蘭盆會，那一個不當件正經事兒去幹。各會館·各公所·各里巷，錠箔高燒，佛號喧　，倘使地獄中眞的有無祀的孤魂，在這兒有吃·有穿·有用，眞是比農人的秋收還高興十倍咧！可是餓鬼們到底實惠與否？我們還無從去調杳；而事實的呈現，倒也沾了餓鬼們不小的光，要算一般發起盂蘭盆會的慈善信士？和主持功德的有道高僧，他們胡混了一陣，袋裏不期而然的「麥克」麥克」了。</p>
<p>盂蘭盆會最要工作，便是一壇燄口，據說許多餓鬼們，本來餓得是口吐燄火，痛苦難忍，仗了我佛法力，洒了我滴靈水，拋了幾粒米穀，餓火全熄，渾身舒快，各各歡喜跳躍，合十禮拜。這些不要講了，便是高僧們打掃了嗓子，調弄了絲竹，外加全新行頭，，袈裟，—電燈排塲，－壇上法器和佛像等，也全用小電燈裝飾，－也够引得附近的善男信女，圍繞觀聽，拍掌喊好，按理這壇燄口主體是餓鬼，閒觀的人們尙是附帶的。現在人們尙在說好，餓鬼們更不消說得當然是雀躍歡欣，威激莫名了。</p>
<p>佛經從印度傳來，雖是譯了華文，多少總帶些梵音氣息。惟獨放燄口念的一部經典，駢四儷六，工整典麗，好像讀唐宋人的小品；尤其是「一心朝請……來受甘露味」那一段，更多精彩。相傳說這篇大手筆倒是蘇東坡老人家做的，因爲他和佛印做了朋友，纔肯寫來送給他。是否可靠，不得而知，總之這篇手筆，一定出之名家，那可以說得定的。</p>
<h3>有趣的小新聞</h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>英國的國皇皇后和皇子等，每逢乘坐皇家御用專車旅行的時候，侍從的人至少有四十名，內中有十個是機械專家，以備發生意外如火車損壞等事的時候，立卽從事修理的。</p>
<p>最近有幾位著名的科學家，發明一種汽油的新原料，那是用海豹的脂肪，篠懸木的木質，和棉花子的油三者混合而成，這種發明對於第二次世界大戰的影響很大。</p>
<p>自從一九〇一年正月以來，在英吉利與惠爾斯二部，計有男子三百三十五名，女子五名因犯罪而處死刑。在此時期中，共有六百二十一名受死刑的判决。平均統計，在英國每一人送進監獄或同樣的機關中去，每年要花費六十金鎊。</p>
<p>現在全世界通行的航空路綫中、路程最長的是從倫敦到爪哇，計有九千英里，每次單程的乘飛機費，要一百八十八金鎊十先令。</p>
<p>維也納的法院中，曾開審兩件案子，都是妻子受不慣吵鬧而控吿丈夫的。其實感情破裂以致提起訴訟的原因，都是爲了女子的愛犬或愛貓過於愛人。內中的一件，是丈夫說他的妻子終是先把食物喂給伊的狗吃，剩下來的東西方始輪到他吃，所以要向伊吵鬧。</p>
<p>南奈伐達一埋沒的城市，已有一萬年的歷史，現被人發掘出來，得到不少有價値的遺蹟，在某種遺蹟上，可以推測往時的居民，在權力上女子較男子爲大。</p>

<p>在培惠區省有一所住宅，叫做浪頓別墅，建築於六十年前，最近拍賣，標價祇有十五先令，可稱最低廉的住宅拍賣價格；不過這所住宅的一切値錢的裝置，在拍賣之前，都已拆除殆盡。</p>
<h3>夏天的南昌</h3>
<p>— 菽</p>
<p>在南昌過夏，可算一件苦事，汽水每瓶大洋三角，氷汽水加半毛，西瓜論斤買，海斤三百五十文，一担賣八塊錢，誰吃得起，因此氷淇淋店像雨後春笋那們發達，水菓灘賣氷洪淋是本行，脚踏車行大餅店也兼做氷洪淋。學校也把開氷淇淋店爲暑期作業，百花洲小學，正蒙小學，新民小學等等早就有飲氷室開張，心遠中學開映露天電影，算是別闢途徑。飮氷室用女招待爲號召，市招上標着特聘平津滬漢美麗女子招待，引得門口擠滿了好奇的路人偷看。</p>
<p>好久不雨，火災便盛起來，自七月二十五日中山路　瓜池汽油棧大火焚斃四命毀二十餘家後，每日平均總有二三次，南昌的消防隊，還在用燒煤的長烟囱水龍，人家火燒，芳鄰放鞭爆座祝，本地習慣如此，警察不干涉的，跟着火燒是太平淸醮，抬着菩薩馬路上走，新都市舊點綴，也是相映成趣的。</p>
<p>電氣扇可以用，電費每度大洋三角，照例是三房客自己出，電標特別快，一個暑假，電費得二十塊錢，說來上海人不會信，但事實是如此的。</p>
<p>担挑的凉粉和香瓜，價錢倒不貴，就是蒼蠅多，中國人吃些蒼蠅不要緊，南昌有的是醫院。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看賣人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>這標語在小西天飯店裏外貼上了一天又有神話一襯托，總算收到了效果，許多人都要看看藍專員，也就有許多人要知道張介夫，他旣用個人的資格來歡迎，想必他也有些地位，要不然，就犯不上做這種事了。於是大家要認識藍專員之餘，却也願意認識這位張介夫先生。不過介夫本人，却不知道全旅館的空氣，有這樣緊張。當晚預備了兩塊錢，靜等楊浣花小姐前去取用。他想着楊浣花這種環境裏，多得一毛錢，有一毛錢的帮助，他一定會來的。殊不料直等到深夜一點鐘，還不見女人的影子，他想着，白天他在程志前屋子裏勾勾搭搭，恐怕是姓程的出得錢多，他到程志前屋子裏去了。心裏這根是有些不服，於是悄悄的走出屋子來，站在志前的屋子外，靜聽了許久。不想裏面僅僅只有志前的鼾呼聲，並不曾配着別的響動。但是雖然沒有響動，心裏依然也寬解不下來，回得房去，半夜不曾安睡。預備的那兩塊現洋，原是放在小衣口袋裏的，自己睡不着，在床上未免翻來覆云的。於是小口袋兩塊錢，嗆啷一聲響，滾了出來。這一下子，可把張介夫驚醒過來了。他不來算得了一回什麼事，這倒很好，省下兩塊錢了。這兩塊錢留到明天，請問幹什麼不好，於是心裏安然着，就睡過去。（二九三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>照普通人家的習慣講，已做寡婦的女人是不應該再用什麼脂粉的，但我們却天天在調弄脂粉，豈非很背禮嗎？可是這也不是我所創的例，上代的老祖宗，已早就這樣了，尤其是我們處在這樣地位上所穿的衣服，往往很鮮艷；衣服的顏色一鮮艷，可就不能讓自己的容顏再保持着灰褐色了，因爲容色和衣色如其太不相稱，委實是非常難看的。這就是我們不能不打扮打扮的緣故！</p>
<p>「現在先說我們所用這種粉：它的原料其實也和尋常的粉一般是用米研成細粉加些鉛便得，並且你從表面上年，它的顏色反面尤比尋常的粉黃一些，但在實際上，却大有區分。第一，它們的原料的選擇是十分精細的，不僅用一種米；新上市的白米之外，還得拚用顏色已發微紫的陳米，如此粉質便可特別的細軟。第二，磨製的手續也决不像外面那樣的草草，新米和陳米揀凈之後，都得用大小不同的磨子研磨上五六次；先在較組的石磨中研，，研凈後篩細，再倒入較細的石磨中去研，研後再篩，這樣研了篩，篩了研的工作，全都由幾個有經騐的老太監担任，可說是絲毫不苟的。這兩種不同的米粉旣研細了，就得互相配合起來，配合的分量也有一定，不能太多太少，否則色澤方面便要大受影響。（三九三）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>消暑小品</h3>
<p>— 白露</p>
<p>夏天是讀書的好天氣，也是睡眠的季節，綠窗人靜，焚　爐香，或者吸一枝淡味的烟捲，讀着你所愛讀的書籍，如果你讀的是屠格湼夫的小說，它會激起你的熱情，如吳你讀的是安德生的童話，它會引你進入幻境……總之，每一種書籍都會給予你以新鮮的不同的作用的。假使你讀書有了倦意，那就不妨睡一覺，夢裏你也許會看見書中的故人和人物。當你醒時，默念：「　凉石枕竹友牀，手倦拋書午夢長，睡罷莞然成獨笑，數聲漁笛在滄浪」詩句，你會欵心這詩是爲你而作的呢。</p>
<p>往事果然不堪回首，但有時想起來却也很有趣的。我記得小時候，每一個夏天都是我最快樂的時節。我家裏有一僩院子，雖然不大，但裏面的花草，因爲經我父親的殷勤灌溉，却都很茂盛。園裏還有幾株芭蕉，有一人多高，濃翠欲滴。每天，我總是和幾僩小朋友躱在蕉葉下玩耍，講故事，或者拿地上的土揑泥人，時常把一雙手弄得塗滿泥汚。有一次我把芭蕉蔭摘下好幾片，舖在地上睡；這是我從一張畫上學來的，那張畫上也畫着一個孩子睡在芭蕉葉上。我正睡得香甜，忽然覺得有人打了我一下，睜開眼來，却見父親扳着面孔站在我面前，我嚇得哭了起來；父親還要打我，幸而母親聽見我哭聲趕到，把我拉到伊房裏去了，一邊還埋怨着父親，說他不應該在小孩子睡着的時候打。我現在已經不是小孩子了，我眼下住的地方也再看不見芭蕉了，但每年夏天來了時，總會使我想起這件事來。</p>
<p>「天下無如吃飯難」！這話說得最道地。有飯吃便什麼都好了。世界上怎麼有强盜和土匪？老實說，他們也是爲生存而競爭而已。不過他們走錯了路綫，因此雖然可以求生於一時，到義免不掉半官裏去，從法官的手裏取取了死的證據，他們是爲着求生而死了。天下最大的悲劇想莫過於此吧。不幸今年跟着夏天來的是：××銀行倒閉，××銀行淸理，××商店關門，……便平空添了無數的失業游民。上海把失業稱爲「砸碎飯碗」，飯碗旣碎，則沒飯可吃，沒飯可吃，則壯者鋋而走險，老弱者除了自殺就沒有別的法門。無怪乎今之報紙新聞，盡爲自殺與險刦案充滿矣。</p>
<p>「夏日可畏」，但畏夏日的只有黃包車夫，苦工，種田佬，以及一切無產階級的市民。至於老爺，太太，少爺小姐，大腹賈，密斯們，他們有冰淇淋可吃，有汽車可兜風，有電風扇可招凉，有冷氣的洋房可藏身，如果這一切的設備還滿意，進一步可到盧山，莫千山，靑島，那些風景美麗，永遠沒有夏天的地方去。他們是不畏夏日的，也許他們還熱烈地歡迎夏天的到來呢。</p>
<p>因爲想到夏天賜給農民們的疾苦，便聯帶地想到一首古舊的詩來：「鋤禾日當午，汗滴禾下土。誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦？」我覺得這才是眞實的農民文學，連三幾的孩子差不多都唸得上口，這比起新興的農民文學來，顯然有價値多啦。我以爲覺得詩雖古舊，它的意味却永遠是新的。</p>

<p>本年上海扶輪盃國際網球賽、咋日下午在上海網球會舉行複賽、中華對日本、英國對美國、前者乃一面倒形勢、後者則勢均力敵、咋日結果、中華已連勝兩單打獲得决賽權、（本年僅賽兩單打一雙打）英美各勝一組、猶待雙打解决决賽資格、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>美車形勢不佳</p>
<p>咋日觀衆並不踴躍、僅二三百人而已、上海會佈置簡陋、有碍觀瞻、而塲地不平、尤使賽員不滿、日本選手大野與須藤俱係普通角色、不經中華林寳華張定釗之迎頭痛擊、英國則由名將德孚及明納維區出傷、美國則爲卡遜與史規亞、雙方勝負關鍵、在於朋納維區與史規亞之一組、理想中德孚不敵卡遜、而史朋二人、球藝相仿、不可預下、史規亞如能在適當時期、不難操得勝券、但咋日形勢全非、毫無把握、反爲朋納維區所敗、至於英美雙打、茲定星期三下午舉行、美國恐兇多吉少、中日雙打、日本已申明棄權、不再、賽矣、</p>
<p>中華淘汰日本</p>
<p>張定釗勝大野</p>
<p>張定釗與大野於下午三時起賽、張夙具靈心探討之精、故其球藝進步之速、亦最令人倣佩、姿勢雖不美、技術甚可靠、正反手抽球、穩健而敏捷、大野遠非其敵、但甚耐戰、結果雖係直落三、但競爭甚爲耐久、大野長抽不敵、試以上綱、經不起張定釗之左右掃射、對抗無能、張幾無往不利、表演其純熟老練之擊法、博得黨聲不少、</p>
<p>林寳華勝須藤</p>
<p>中日第二組爲林寶華對須藤、自始至終、須藤一任林寳華之玩弄、聽憑林之指使、而左右前後奔跑不遑、林以對手支術欠虽、擊去益見穩建、左右手之抽擊及斬球、恰正過網、美麗悅目、林連勝十一局後、始爲須藤奪得一局、三盤結果、須藤僅得二局、然已不易矣、</p>
<p>英美秋色平分</p>
<p>史規亞敗於朋納費區</p>
<p>美英之戰、最先上海者爲史規亞與朋納維區、下午三時開始、以爲必有劇戰、不意史規亞精神不振、擊出之球、一再送入綱中、使對手不用深謀遠思、垂手而勝、但朋納維區之擊法、亦頗有功夫、左右對射、恰到妙處、加以史規亞自暴自棄、故勝來極易、</p>
<p>卡生苦戰五盤勝德孚</p>
<p>卡遜對德孚可謂今年扶輪盃中最精彩之節目、目平素二人從未交手、形勢莫測高下、惟以平時個別之觀察批評、卡遜在德孚之上也、故昨日一旦相遇、無不洗目而觀、</p>
<p>二人經五盤劇戰、始分勝負、卡遜雖勝、甚覺吃力、德竿雄健如昔、其敏捷爽脆之擊法、使卡遜大窘、惜以長力不足、不堪久戰、卡遜表演失常、球機不能聽其指揮、頻頻觸網、幾爲德孚所敗、開始之一盤、卡遜表演之惡劣、等於一無名小卒、德孚以可靠之擊法、六比二勝之極易、第二盤自四比四後、德孚幾次自殺遂爲卡遜得勝、第三盤競爭最烈、表演最有精彩、卡遜連腓之後、第二盤卡遜又在不景氣狀况中、以二比六失敗、最後一盤、卡遜賴其壯健之體格、依舊不變常態、德孚已疲憊不支、卡遜以六比一得最後勝利、</p>
<p>英美雙打星期三舉行</p>
<p>英美雙打星期三在上海會舉行、英國由德孚與朋納維區出塲、美國亦仍由卡遜與史規亞合組、勝利希望、以英國校爲濃厚、</p>

<h3>小男兒（十九）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>因此小橋就被移送到梅莊，他對那裏的生活十分愛好，梅格，喬恩和他的外公，都自以定策不誤，深自欣慰。常和其他男孩子相伴，便使他實際的能力漸漸萌發出來，鼓動了他的精神，并且刷除了他自在小腦子裏愛結的那些徒然美麗的絲網。自然，當他回家時不免驚助了他的母親，因爲他開閉門戶時碰得很響，口裏發誓，還要一雙高大粗厚的靴子，「匍得像爸爸的。」然而喬恩對他反覺歡喜，聽見那些有力的話反而笑着，爲他去買到了那陣靴子，泰然說道，「他這麼就行：所以且讓他去　罷。我要我的兒子成爲具有丈夫氣的男子，他偶然的組率是無傷於他的。我們可以漸漸使他文雅起來：至於學問，他自會隨地取拾像鴿子拾荳一般。所以不要催逼他。」</p>
<p>小梅一直明朗而可愛，日益嫵媚婉好，如　　之始展，因爲她是像她柔和的母親，又愛好小小的家事。她有了一家子的囡囡兒，她敎養他們的方法，堪爲母親的模範；她必得有她的小工作籃帶在手頭才覺安心，　縫紉得那麼好，小橋不禁要常常抽出他的手帕來誇示她細潔的針線，菊綏小寶寶竟有了件怫蘭絨的小背心，係出於小梅姊姊巧妙的製作。她喜歡在磁器欄裏摸索，預備鹽碟子，將羹匙等平整地安　在桌上天天執　繞客室而行，隨手爲桌椅坲拭塵灰。小橋稱爲「多管事」，然而也很高興有她來爲他整理什物，在各種事上有她靈巧的手指來幫忙，又幫助他的功課，他們倆在功課上總是並　齊進，從沒有比勝之心的。</p>

<h3>醫療大衆化與公醫制（下）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>右了上這種種原因，所以，要靠少數挂牌的私人醫師的免費送診，來推行醫療於下層大衆，要實行醫療大衆化，達到醫療大衆化的目的，是斷斷做不到辦不通的事。事實上，全體的營業醫師，是否肯個個注意及此，個個拿出慈悲心腸，個個能抽出一部份的時間，來做免費送診的工作，還是大問題。就退一步說：假使能够辦到，照此做了，也只是限於中等階級的中層大衆，而數目最多生活最苦的下層大衆，仍然根本談不上。再具體地說：如在上海的社會環境中，免費送診，至多只對於每月也有三十五十元收入的中等階級一部份人，或能得到些微的好處，至對於每月收入不到十元八元的下層大衆勞苦階級，乃無絲毫的補益。</p>
<p>那末，用什麼方法，才能眞正使醫療大衆化，不但使中等大衆能享受至醫療的好處，使人數最多生活最苦的無產大衆，都能享到醫療的福利，達到「醫療大衆化一的理想目的呢？我以爲還不能靠私人醫師的免費送診，須要政府的力量來有系統的舉辦公醫制，才能解決這個問題。</p>
<p>這種公醫制，似乎有人曾經提起過；可是要使醫療深入民間，的確只有採用這種公醫制，要根本的解决醫藥大衆化普遍化這一問題，亦惟有採用公醫制的辦法。</p>
<p>至於舉辦這種公醫制的大事業；必須要由國家來主持，來推行，才有實效的希望，才有辦到的可能。因爲一則國家始有舉辦此種公醫制的職權和能力，二則國家還負有解决全體大衆的醫療問題的應有義務。這次義務，正好像人民對國家有納稅的義務一樣。</p>
<p>如其不由國家去舉辦，只由社會少數私人或公團零零星星去主辦，一則因經濟能力的關係，不易持久，每有虎頭蛇尾的毛病，二則因無系統化的統一計畫，不易辦得美滿，三則因私人或公團等等，對於此項事業並無限定的應盡義務，可隨各人的興趣，可辦可不辦。若由國家主持，政府舉辦，便可免去這種種的弊端。同時有能力有財力的私人及公團，仍可恊助政府，帮同推行，自能收到偉大的效果了。</p>
<p>這種由國家主持舉辦的公醫制，才是解决「醫療大衆化」的根本辦法。</p>
<p>可是，這種計畫，是要看政府人員的興趣，這種事業的施行，又要看政府當局的財力。所以講到實施上，不管客觀的社會環境，仙病交迫的全體大衆，需要醫療是如何的急迫；然在此民窮財盡的局面，現社會的經濟狀態，要使理想化爲事實，又不無有「談何容易」之慨哩！</p>
<h3>肺結核</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>醫學故事之七</p>
<p>肺結核是最普通的肺部疾病。肺結核的療治，重在初步症狀的診察。當結核菌侵犯身體任何部分—大抵爲肺，骨與關節，淋巴腺，腎臟，及底腦膜等部分的時候，那一部分的組織就起一種特殊的反動。這反動是屬於防護性質的，爲的是吞沒與消滅那些來侵犯的結核菌。反動的結果是組織起變化。從肉眼看來，這是顯現在組織上面的微小的灰白色的斑點。用顯微鏡窺察，我們可以看到它是一個較大的中心細胞，由許多細胞集合而成，週圍被一圈白血球包圍着。較大的中心細胞巳把結核菌吞沒，正在殺死它們。通常它是成功的。</p>
<p>任何人都會偶然威染肺結核的。但在威染肺結核的人們中，十個有九個會於不知不覺中已消滅了那些來侵犯的結核菌。有時，結核菌得到滋長的機會，被害的組強便開始起腐化。在肺部，到了這一階段，往往發生第二種疾病，就是：其他病菌侵入肺的柔軟部分，使傷害擴大。</p>
<p>奧斯勒氏（William　Osler）把肺結核的感染比擬播種，頗爲愜當。他說：當播種子的時候，有些種子落在石地上，有些被飛鳥啄去，有些落在莠草中間，受它們的阻遏。就結核菌的感染而言，我們大多數好比石地，使它們無從安身。在一部分人們，血球細胞好比飛鳥：它們把病菌掃淸了。在另一部分人們，體身組織的具防謎功能的反勤，好比莠草對於種子，阻止了病菌的滋長。但在少數人，闖入的結核菌找到了優惠的環境，得以滋長與蕃殖。</p>
<p>對於肺結核初步症狀的最適官的診察者，是病人自己。在若干年前的Stantic　Monthly中，有一篇文字，題目叫做肺結核患者的自白（Confessions　of　aT．B．）。作者是美國某大學的一位歷史敎授。在這篇文字中，作者描述自己在肺結核病中的經騐。他的最初的症候，是一種「難堪的疲乏」。這疲乏和尋常的「神經」的或「氣力」的疲乏不同。卽使在休息着的時候，他也威到一種「肉體的累贅」。每天下午，他躺在牀上，他的身體中每一肌肉纖維似乎在個別地呼號它的疲乏。肺結核患者的初步症候，都是如此。後來，咳嗽起來了。更後來，咳吐起來了。年靑人若遇體重逐步减一輕，便非留意診察不可。</p>
<p>最重要的診察方法，是每日測最體溫四次—上午八點鐘，十二點鐘，下午四點鐘，八點鐘。當肺結核初步發生的時侯，在上午，體溫比正常的體溫低；到了下午，昇到九十九度至一百度，到晚上，又回降至原有溫度。隨着病勢的進展，每天的體溫變化逐漸加重。除測量體溫外，診察胸部，檢査唾液，用愛克司光察看，也都是不可省的手續。</p>
<p>至於療治肺結核，單靠醫生是不够的。病人及其家屬所想到的第一伴事，是適宜的氣候。這是經濟上的事。但氣候不是主要的條件；若爲了氣候而放棄其他主要的條件，便是重大的錯誤。人體（The　Human　Body）作者克林登　博士（Logan　Clendening，M．D．）曾把外行人　醫生對於治療肺結核的各種絛伴的意見列表比較如下。</p>
<p>外行人的意見：</p>
<p>第一：氣候</p>
<p>第二：血漿</p>
<p>第三：騎馬</p>
<p>第四：含金的藥</p>
<p>第五：牛奶和乳酪</p>
<p>醫生的意見：</p>
<p>第一：休息</p>
<p>第二：新鮮空氣</p>
<p>第三：額外的食物</p>
<p>第四：外科手術</p>
<p>第五：精神的鼓勵</p>
<p>第六：氣候</p>
<p>用外科手術療治肺結核，是從一九一〇年開始的，其意義是把腐化部分割除，以免蔓延。目前，非到最後地步，醫生决不用此方法。至於用新鮮空氣療治肺結核，是一八四五年由巴丁登（George　Boddingtong）發明的。當他最初著女發表此項發明的時候，他遭受一般醫學界的反對，甚至被停止職務。</p>

<h3>止痛的醫學（二十八）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>手部膿腫</p>
<p>成語有「十指速心」，意卽手部受傷或生膿腫十分疼痛。手指生膿腫不但是十分疼痛並且也是非常危險。茲舉一例爲證：我在醫學時在我前一班有一位在醫院實習時，一日在病理所將一手指刺破所出不過一滴血，立時擦上碘酒消毒。他以爲預防方法已實行當然沒有事了。誰知事有出人意料之外，一兩日後手指刺破處起始紅腫，且臂上也發現紅綫病狀（急性淋巴管炎）。病者也發冷發熟。漸以腋下之淋巴腺也成膿腫。再數日同邊的胸腔內也充滿了膿水，病勢沉重已達到極點，生命實已絕望。唯因他是在落山磯市市立大醫院遭遇此難，著名醫師都不願見他爲醫術而犧牲，於斯决定選全市醫學界多數名流擔任治療，日夜三班私人護士服務。內外手術一齊施行。卽輸血一項治療，每數日一次，一共已有數十次之多。嚴重的時期歷數月之久。他昏厥了數次，自己也知不能生存。豈知科學有時也能勝天，經近一年的科學治療，他到底得到了再慶生還。他現在仍是健在。</p>
<p>這是一種特殊的遭遇，並非每人手指受傷都是這樣倒霉。然而每逢手部受傷或生瘡却是含有危險性。手指刺破大概有以下幾種結果：（一）局部成膿腫。在成膿前日夜疼痛。成膿後開刀不用蒙藥也是很痛。用局部麻藥不能完全。免去疼痛。雖是開刀有一點疼痛但不應當不開。（二）手指膿腫傳至手掌全部，全手掌腫脹疼痛較之手指膿腫更加十倍。如果手指成膿時早開刀大概可以避免蔓延及手掌。（三）除局部發炎外加上臂部淋巴管炎或腋下淋巴腺膿腫。（四）如以上所舉之例。</p>
<p>手指手掌部膿腫在未成熟時可有幾種止痛消腫的辦法。用冷熱法，如浸手在熱水內三分鑪（漸加熱水以能忍受爲度），繼浸於冷水內半分鐘。如此冷熱各三次。一日施行數次。熱冷水之作用，（一）減去發炎部之張力使變成鬆弛的狀况，故能止痛。（二）加增血流故有消腫之效。用熟冷之外將手部完全休息（全身休息更好）也是非常要緊。使發炎部休息也是止痛的一法。其次用止痛藥水或止痛藥糊也有些止痛的效力。</p>
<p>小便痛</p>
<p>現在有一種疾病在曙地裏突飛猛進，各國如此，我國各大城市更是普徧傳染令人驚異。那是什麽疾病？是很容易猜。就是淋病。在歐美有大概統計，在有的國家全國男性在半數以上染過林病。我國向無統計，並且這種統計材料也不易得到，不過由大城市花柳醫院的生意興隆狀况與報紙上充斥淋病藥的廣告可以看出花柳病之流毒有意想不到之普徧。這旣是一種暗疾，所以大多數患者所受的痛苦也是暗痛苦。</p>
<p>急性時期的淋病第一個要緊病狀是小便時疼痛。現在要問問爲什麽小便時痛？痛的根本原因是尿道發炎。第二個原因是尿的成分不合於發炎的尿道。雖是根本止痛的辦法是治愈尿道發炎，但多是短時期內達不到目的。至减少痛苦却是較容易辦到。茲略述减除痛苦的原理：現在比方在任何破傷處滴些醋，其結果自然是非常疼痛。爲什麼痛？是醋內酸叫爛處痛。那末，平常的尿是酸，尿越濃酸性也越重。那就是，平常的尿經過發炎的尿道時尿內的酸激刺發炎處。發炎處受激刺就是痛，激刺越大痛也越難忍。現在反過來講，比方將破皮處浸在淸水內，傷處受激刺很小疼痛也很少。若是又浸在小蘇打水內，傷處幾不受激刺故無痛苦。那末，很淡的尿含酸最少，經過發炎處時激刺也很少，故疼痛也很少。若是內服和平性的鹼性藥品將尿變爲淡鹼性，或中和性，那樣經過尿道時疼痛就可减去百分之九十九。總而言之多喝水使尿淡减低酸度與內合宜鹼性藥品是止小便痛的正當辦法。</p>
<p>有時疼痛過甚，內服鎭痛藥品也是正當的辦法。此種藥品是鎭定神經，經鎮靜神經致大腦司痛覺威應遲鈍，其結果疼痛亦等於减少。這一類藥如澳化鈉，澳化鉀，亥俄賽阿民等與任何相類藥品用得其當均無不可。尿道痛的人小便末了時不可用收縮力以排凈餘尿，因小便用力收縮可以增加疼痛。若小便末了時餘尿任其自然慢慢滴去可免去疼痛不少。</p>
<p>在本篇的起頭已講過用冷熱水療法於止痛有不小的效力，同時與身體有益無害。對於任何痛如此，對於小便痛也是一樣。若長小便痛極時將小便浸在熱水內一短時間末了溺在熱水內可减少疼痛不少。晚上就寢前將小便浸在熱水內一時大概可免去夜間小便硬痛。</p>
<p>若是尿道的後部有急性發炎非常疼痛，患者若坐在熱水缸內每次歷數鐘，每數小時一次效力也不小。初入水時水熱可由法倫表一百〇四度起（熱水）等入水後可漸加熱水熱度到能忍受爲止。其次用熱水冲洗直腸也有益不少，因直腸與尿道後部發炎部相隔很近。</p>
<p>除了用熱外用冷也有相當好處。若是小便硬痛發作時向小便上澆冰水或浸在極冷水內立時就可鬆弛緊張全消。冬天比夏天方便些不必用冰水，平常冷水就够了。若外加內服鎮靜神經藥品也是有益的。</p>
<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常職</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（六十）淚囊膿漏</p>
<p>淚囊膿漏又稱慢性加答兒性淚囊炎。一般俗間祇知以爲是由眼睛有病的關係。因爲本病的主徵。是流淚。而流淚是一種普通眼病具有的症侯。所以無怪乎病家常常悮爲眼病。實則本病除有流淚之外。尙有下眼瞼內眥部發生隆起。時或該部皮膚現出潮紅色。若加指壓於該部。則有膿性，粘液性，或漿液性的液體流出。這是我們應當注意的幾點。對於診斷上，也是有莫大的輔助。本病的主要原因。是由於淚鼻管的不通。至於淚鼻管不通的綠故。大概是因淚鼻管的狹窄。狹窄的起因。有（一）萎縮性鼻炎，（二）腺病，梅毒，狼瘡，及癩病，（三）骨疽，（四）鼻茸腫，（五）梅毒性骨膜炎，（六）腺病性骨膜炎，（七）骨折，及（八）腫瘍等等。有時原因不明。亦可發生。</p>
<p>本病的經過。多爲慢性。有時因爲淚囊壁常有液體充滿其間。以致失去彈力性。而生淚囊無力症。有時因爲淚囊壁的膨脹增加。現出囊腫樣的外觀。或向前方隆起。或向後方膨大。壓迫眼球。是卽可所謂淚囊水腫，有時因淚囊部的化膿。引起囊壁及皮膚的破壞。因此往往殘留淚囊瘻管。患者此時每每苦於流淚（若遺風，烟，塵等時，則更劇）。時而引起慢性結膜炎，眼瞼綠炎，濕疹，及下眼瞼外翻症等症。時而竟可惹起角膜潰瘍或化膿性眼炎而致失明。</p>
<p>講到本病的治療方針。第一，應當探求淚鼻管不通的原因。第二，設法排除淚鼻管的狹窄。第三，排出淚囊部所潴留的液體。第四，用洗滌法洗淸淚囊。不過這四種治療方針。當然須由眼科醫師施之爲宜。</p>
<h3>現代花柳病學通俗演講（十四）</h3>
<p>— 陳生自（編述）殷木强（校正）</p>
<p>第二編　淋病</p>
<p>局部治療者。爲以藥液直接作用於罹病粘膜之法也。是爲最合理而主要之療法。於此吾人當注意者。卽</p>
<p>甲，局部治淋劑之條件使用治淋劑。須備有種種之條件。早爲Neisser氏所倡導。卽</p>
<p>對於淋菌須有强有力之殺菌能力。但不能損害組織。</p>
<p>b．對於粘膜。當無刺戟而增加炎症之弊者．</p>
<p>c．須有深達粘膜下組織之作用。但不能凝固食鹽及蛋白質。致妨害洽愈。</p>
<p>欲治淋劑之有深達作用。先使不與組織液相結合。而避免减輕其作用。前論淋菌對藥物之通性時。已述及之。故治淋劑之投與。以不使之與食鹽或蛋白質相結合者爲必要。例如昇汞，硝酸銀之與組織相結合者。不特减輕其藥效。旦在該處生沉澱物。而阻塞其深達之道。但在另一方面。則有沉澱物時。却可防止淋菌之繁殖。且當沉澱物再溶解時。尙存暫時的殺菌作用。惟衡以得失。淋病之應用本劑。終不能認完滿之效果也。</p>
<p>乙，使用之注意急性期間。當先用內服藥及消炎法等减其症狀。而後用局部療法。是爲至要。蓋不聰明之局部療法。雖可以减殺菌毒於一時。但有損於粘膜。而减其自然之抵抗力。不無遺憾存焉。</p>
<p>局部療法。有注入法，洗滌法，及Janet氏灌注法三種。隨症施治。固無弊端可生。惟在有數病家。每自行施術。致本爲前尿道炎。而續發後尿道炎或其他病變者。屢見之。是又當注意者也。</p>
<p>以上所述。僅爲普通治療智識。至於其他看效藥劑之投興。及治療之手技等等。爲專門醫師事。故略。</p>
<p>第七章　淋病之診斷及預防</p>
<p>淋病之診斷。普通可依旣往之經過。一般之症狀而知之。至於分泌液或膿汁中特異病原菌之蹬明。當更爲可靠。此外在慢性淋病之分泌少。症狀輕者。其診斷較難。又欲鑑定病變之所在者亦難。此非有專門學識者不可也。</p>
<p>淋病之預防法。與徽毒大同小異。茲撮述個人預防上數要項如下。</p>
<p>甲·遠離不正當之交際塲所，如妓院，賭塲，酒館等處。多好色淫樂之徒所麕集。受染之機會極多。</p>
<p>乙·絕對禁止不潔之性交，己犯者。當於性交之後。立時放尿，並用消毒水或油膏洗塗陰部。其他如大醉後之性交。中絕性交。射精後陰莖長時間留於腔內。均爲感染之誘因。當嚴禁。</p>
<p>丙·男子之有包莖者。每以汚物之停積。易受傳染。故應早期割治。</p>
<p>丁·浴室之器具。公共場所之手巾。厠所中之物品等。皆爲本病間接之傳染病。亦須注意之。</p>
<p>第三編　軟性下疳</p>
<p>第一章　關於軟性下疳</p>
<p>軟性下疳（Ulcus　mole）之在吾國。據臨床之一報吿。知其蔓延頗廣。至於已往歷史。舊有醫籍上。苦無確當之證據。故略之。</p>
<p>按軟性下疳。爲由固有之病原菌所發生之性病性潰瘍也。由於本病原菌之侵襲。乃在局部發生病變。但不起全身症狀。此與徵毒，淋病之能轉移於全身各部者不同。</p>
<p>甲病原菌　軟性下疳之病原。由一八八九年意人Ducrey氏之發現。知爲細小之桿菌。長約一·五U。幅約〇·四U。兩端稍鈍圓。中央稍狹。單獨的或集簇的存在於膿球之體內或體外。其在組織間者。則呈特有之連鎖狀。</p>
<p>乙症候，部位，及經過　軟性下疳主由不潔之性交。依皮膚或粘膜之小損傷部的病原菌之侵入而發病。本病之發生。其潛伏期甚短。或竟無之。當本病初起。只見表皮之剝落。而顯著之症狀。於二三日後方見之。故吾人可確認。軟性下疳之發生。每在一週以內。若在一週後方發生者。則診斷時有愼重考慮之必要。本病發生時之症狀。先以紅色之丘疹。繼卽化膿。成特有之潰瘍。卽以（一）邊緣凹凸不齊，作鋸齒狀或鼠噙狀，向皮下穿掘。（二）周圍有著明之紅暈。（三）排出多量之膿汁。（四）鮮紅色之肉芽面。（五）膿汁附着他部時，能自己接種更生新潰瘍，或由小變大。成碩大之潰瘍。或作綫狀與蛇行性蔓延。或侵蝕深部。或形成壞疸。爲其特徵。其自覺症狀。則有初起時之灼熱感及痛感（經磨擦或牽引時更甚）。他如體溫及全身狀態。在純粹之軟性下疳。每無異常。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（六四）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>（三）結核與哮喘症　結核和哮喘症的關係，各家的意見是不一致的：有些人以謂是狠密切，有人是完全反對的。在事實上，兩症連合的例子，確是不多見的。在慢性肺結核型式中，有時在行路登高的時候，狠多發生呼吸困難狀態，這狠容易使一般人錯認的！</p>
<p>（四）結核與瘧症　結核和瘧症，如果連合發生了，對於預後情形的揣測，各家也是意見分歧的。有人以謂是趨於惡劣的，有人則認爲由此而轉愈的。因爲在流行瘧症的熱帶區域中，兼患兩症的例子是狠多的，但結果優良者狠多，並且好多是貧民階級，毫無治療的。所以肺結核患者，一部分人主張用人工傳染瘧症法，俾易轉愈的；這方面的成績如何，迄今還沒有一致的判論。</p>
<p>此外，我們要曉得，肺結核症到了轉愈或完全停止進行的時際，如果發生別的傳染病症了，他是狠容易死灰復燃的。像小孩之患麻症百日咳，都是狠明顯的例子；此外，若戚冒，咽峽炎，流行性威冒症，都對於肺部是狠不利的。此種病者，除開上列諸症的治療外，須絕對休息，對於受凉之防止，也應該十分注意的。</p>
<p>附錄　任娠與肺結核</p>
<p>婦女的姙娠，本來是一件狠平凡的事情，但如果發現於患有肺結核症的婦女身上，則馬上會引起人鄭重注意的。他是對於結核症（特殊是肺結核）有弊無利的，潛伏性可變成進行性，結果會發生流產或早產；所以我們拿姙娠當作肺結核的合併症，亦無不可。</p>
<p>那末，我們對亽患有肺結核症之婦女發現任娠，應該如何處置呢？稍有一點醫學常職的人們，都曉得人工墮胎一手術有時是免不了的。但這一種手術之執行與否？醫者須經過數番慎重考慮方可决定，决不能冒昧從事的。我們應該要詳悉病症的眞正狀態。進行性呢？潛伏性呢？抑是痊愈的狀態呢？如果在痊愈狀態以下的比較影響不多；潛伏性是狠容易變成進行性的；這兩種都應該經過長時期診察方可斷定的。如果進行性症象已經顯明了，痰中也可見結核桿菌了，則人工墮胎一手術是應該執行的；以愈早愈妙，最好在姙娠第一月中行之，最遲亦須在四月以內。四月以後則除决對必要外，以愼重爲是。</p>
<p>喉結核是一個狠嚴重的病症，上列的手術也是勢在必行的，但如果在姙娠末期，而病者無痊愈希望時，則官靜待姙娠終了，以保全拾兒之生命。（第十一章完）</p>

<h3>商業銀行農村投資之利幣</h3>
<p>— 新在</p>
<p>最近三四年以來，農村衰落的尖銳和都市金融的呆滯，金融界以及救濟農村之人士，都主張商資投入農村，使都市的「過剩」和農村的『枯竭』，互相調劑，這的確是金融事業的一個出路。可是我們再進一步研究，商資投入農村後，能不能復興農村？是否係一個永久的辦法？這確是疑問。我以爲商業銀行承做農業投資，一方面固有種種利益，但在他業務的本質上同時也發現了許多缺陷，現把他的利弊分別討論如後</p>
<p>A利益</p>
<p>（一）農業投資本，本來是大量的，我國土地廣大，農人又如此之多，當然更需要大量的農業投資，在政府財力困頓的現在，要全靠政府來維持，事實上斷乎不能。商業銀行來做農業放欵，確可補救這一點政府財力之不足。</p>
<p>（二）農村崩潰的事實已爲一般人所明瞭，母須多述，生產資金之缺乏乃可斷言。如有商資投入農村，可使農民金融周轉靈活，改良生產事業，而農民的生活環境，也可因之改進。</p>
<p>（三）農村旣缺乏資金，高利貸乃必然的結果、普通的利率總在二分左右、內地則大多在二分惟上。商業銀行放欵於合作社，普通九釐，合作社轉貸於農民，約一分四至一分五，比農村原有的利率，至少要低五六釐，這不能不說是商資流入農村的貢獻</p>
<p>（四）中國農業投資尙未達最高限變，决不受土地酬報遞减的影響。據一般農學家的推論，如採用良種及多施肥料，可增加一倍之產量，這種估計因不能輕信，但我國農業投資的尙未達於極限（Limitation）却可肯定，苟有商資流入，生產自可遞增。</p>
<p>（五）整個的金融事業，都市與農村是成循環性的（Cycle），農產物出售，資金流入農村，農人購買工商品，資金就流向都市，這樣工商業金融和都市金融成了一個簡單的循環系統，他們必一貫融通，然後可以相提並進，所以商資投入農村，不特是復興了農業，同時也成爲發展工商業的一個準備。</p>
<p>B缺陷</p>
<p>（一）推開板壁說亮話，商資投農村的最後目的，並非是救濟農村，却在佔幾個利息，所以放欵的是否穩固，農人能否按期付息都是他們的先决問題。這樣能借欵的人，無形就限於具有田產的自耕農了。但事實吿訴我們，頂需要資金上接濟的却是佔百分之五十五的半自耕農和佃農，所以商資的投入農村是局部的，階級化的，不能作普遍的救濟。</p>
<p>（二）商資旣須求其穩固，對於貸欵數額遂有相當的限制，其貸欵多少，每不以用途爲標準，而視其抵押品之價値承借人之信用及資產來决定。這一點自然有不可掩飾的錯誤，我們知道農民借欵的用途固須正當，而其數額亦務必能適合此種用途，使承借人可整套的使用。假使貸欵不够他的需要，就失却貸欵的目的，更因移於他用的關係，反增加了農民無謂的消費。醫如農民想買廿塊錢的農具，但因信用和抵押品的不足，能借到十五元，他就無法買此農具，遂將這十五元錢分散移用，增加他不是迫切的消費，這原是極平常的事實。所以借欵的數額最好視其正當之用途而定，不能全依抵押品及信用來做唯一的標準。介商業銀行爲求穩固起見，這一點是决難辦到的。</p>
<p>（三）農業投資的期限，普通較工商業要長，因爲農業的循回期（Turnover）很慢，投資之期限，自然因之延長。考世界農業金融週轉的期限最長的是法國，不動產抵押可達七十五年，德國五十六年，意大利五十年，日本的勸業銀行，亦有五十年之長期借貸，美國聯邦土地銀行（Federal　LandHank）四十年，由這些數字，我們知道，農業的投資的確是需要長期的。但這一點和商業銀行的放欵，是背馳太甚了，他們的使命在流轉金融市面，自然對於農業投資也不能期限太長，我所知道的都在一年以內，八個月居最多數。這種不能迎合農人時間上需要的放欵，也是商資的缺陷。</p>
<p>（四）商資投入農村，固可壓低現在的高利率，前面已經說過，但我以爲這種貸欵利率的高低不能僅和當地原有的利率比較，應該和農業本身的利率比較，如不能比農業投資的利率低，那就不是一個根本的辦法。我們根據金陵大學農學院的調査（見Buck：Chluess　FarmEconomy）農塲投資平均所得的利率不過是九，四釐，這是一九二。五年的材料，到今年，天災人禍雙重摧殘了十年，我想現在投資農業的利率，一定還不到九？四釐。商業放欵利率，農民實得的是一分四五，以一分五的借欵投於農業，得到九，四釐的利息，農民還須虧本五釐，如常此下去，農村同樣有日趨衰落的危險。所以商資投入農村，在理論上根本就發生了問題，决非是救濟農村澈底的辦法。</p>
<p>關於商資投入農村的利弊，已可看得淸淸楚楚，我們的結論是這樣？在政府財力困頓無法投資農業的今天，商業銀行臨時來補救政府力量之不足，是可以的。假使要謀澈底而根本救濟農村，那就不能奢望於商業銀行了。政府應就財力所及籌劃農行，實施合理的農業放欵。道一點希望政府方面，特別是迷戀於商資救濟農村的人，在此銀行辦理農貸的高潮下，切實注意。</p>
<h3>美國提高銀價政策之檢討</h3>
<p>— 潘文安</p>
<p>自一九三三年十二月美國實行購銀政策以來，銀價逐步上騰，在本年三月以前，盤旋於每盎司五角四分左右，顧因美國財部之賡續購買，投機者之需求殷切，與中國之禁銀輸出，供稀求繁，至三月中而突呈激挺，四月十日之世界銀價，幾與美國國內收購礦銀每盎司六角四分·六四之價並駕齊驅，故美總統又有提高國內銀價至每盎司七角一分之舉，引起世界莫大之注意。而世界銀價竟與美國銀價，亦步亦趨，現貨交易激漲至六角九分半，期貨交易竟逾七角一分。舉世之投機者，均認美國此舉，爲决心貫澈購銀法案之實證。美總統鑒於市塲銀價之升漲，已與購銀定價相距微幾，復於四月二十四日宣布第二次提高銀價至每盎司七角七分·五七，而市價亦備帶漲至每盎司八角一分半。嗣後總統未將銀價作第三次之提高。故市價亦遂回軟至七角五六分左右。　我人未可遽信爲銀派議員有變更提高市價至每盎司一元二角九分之企圖也。</p>
<p>十六比一標準之維護</p>
<p>我人更不能希望銀派企圖提高銀價，至此而止，不再提高。試觀政府自减低金元成分以後，白銀派欲將銀元成分同樣减低；良以金元成分原爲純金二五·八格蘭，成色百分之九〇，自减低爲純金十五又二十一分之五以後，，如不將銀元成分同樣减低，則金元與銀元之比例，將改原有之十六比二爲二十七比一，即二十七盎司白銀，方可等於純金一盎司也。</p>
<p>乃者，銀派有力分子，更擁護十六比一之標準。四月間曾力說參院農業委員會贊同一議案，由政府命令財部按月收購白銀五千萬盎司，以達財部準備銀一金三之比例，或市價十六比一，果此項比例而形諸法令，則財部勢必以每盎司二元一角八分之高價購買白銀矣。</p>
<p>供給减少愈使銀價趨高</p>
<p>演成目前銀價之激漲，有一重要因素，即除中國與印度外，世界竟無巨量之白銀供給者，即以美國新產之礦銀而論，年產祇二萬萬盎司以上，尙未克由美政府全部收購，一部份尙須供應工藝之用途。中國以銀爲本位，業已頒布限制銀輸出之命令，其他用銀國家，目擊危機，早晚必須探取類似之步驟，實可預料。苟此等國家而能有效的禁止溶毀銀幣，私售白銀，則均足以减少白銀之供給，促進銀價之高漲：然以中國爲例，欲保持存銀不使因價高而流出，實感不易耳。，</p>
<p>印度存銀較多，除民間窖藏不易估計外，祗國庫及儲備銀行所存，爲數約達三萬一千萬盎司之多，顧印度受倫敦白銀協定之限制，每年出售白銀，不得遂三千五百萬盎司，故對於銀市之漲落，無足重輕。惟値得我人注意者，即銀市旣呈上漲之趨勢，印度及其他國家之投機者，相率屯銀不售，或竟爲虎作倀，競事收買，以冀繼續趨漲，利市十倍，證以事實，據倫敦方面之報吿，印度投機者，踴躍購銀，爲掀高銀價之有力因素，在茲畢世爭奪白銀之時，不待美國積儲巨量白銀，祗須賡續收購，則銀價不難立達每盎司一元二角九分，或竟　　十六與一之比例，未爲奇也。</p>
<p>然則銀價高至頂點以後，又將如何？如我人試一爲探討；銀價停止上漲以後，投機者將急謀脫手，惟資牟利，當此之時，能支持銀價者，舍美國草屬，我人固知目前各國均無意於改用金銀複本位，或提高銀價，則美國不得不以最昂之價格，用存金將市上白銀全部收買，據査倫敦之投機者，握有白銀一萬萬盎司，正待售諸美國，美國所實施之征收白銀交易稅百分之五十，其效果僅將美國原有交易，驅諸國外，其因銀價變動而獲得之贏利，悉屬於國外投機家所有矣。</p>
<p>購銀計劃之進展</p>
<p>美國自實施購銀以來，雖進行不遺餘力，顧按照購銀法案所定之數量，及現有金準備比例，尙須大量購買。此項偉大之購銀計劃，使全球悉素敝賦，以相獻納，價騰倍蓰，遂致用銀國家，通貨收縮，痛苦曷極。蓋自上年六月以來，國庫購入之銀已達四萬萬盎司，惟庫內金準備亦巳增高，故欲適合總額四分之一比率，必須較多之白銀，易言之，國庫雖不斷收購白銀，而距離預定之目標尙遠。以現狀而論，尙須續購一萬萬盎司，方稱足額。此鉅量之白銀將從何而來，殊無把握，何况存金加多，則應購白銀之量，又將增加乎。</p>
<p>購銀計劃對於信用基礎之影響</p>
<p>或謂减低國庫之存金量，則對於總額爲一比四之存銀量，亦可减少，然此實足以减弱幣制之基礎。又謂購銀法案之實施，不啻將美國原有過剩之黃金，重行分配與他國，對於復興世界經濟，不無小補。此種謬見，可謂知其一不知其二；蓋將美國存金重加分配，固屬利人利己之舉，惟分配之途徑，必須出於正常之貿易，如僅以金易銀，死藏不用，殊未盡分配之道也。如美國果捨棄存金之一部，則必須有相當有用之交換物品，足以增殖國富，方可取償；今也積存鉅額白銀，高騰其價，果有何用？欲加出售，則足以壓低市價；用以鑄幣，則通貨膨脹；反不若保有生鐵錫及木材等於國庫，可以用作救荒之需，或歸公用，其利反溥矣。</p>
<p>收買之銀，原意可用以代替黃金，作爲通貨之準備，此種假定，實堪反對；良以銀爲信用通貨之一種，所以能雜持幣面價値者，全賴政府規定得與金及他秤貨幣互相兌換，故銀之本身，實不足以構成準備也。</p>
<p>銀價提高至一元二角九分，或竟高於此價，如美國欲以之作爲信用機構之準備，則其基礎必不鞏固，苟一旦而所發通貨，羣來兌現，假定幸而存銀得以脫售，然欲售斯高價，實屬難能，故終必仰賴於金準備，以資應付；馴至金貨罄盡，金本位不克維持，意中事耳。故金準備漸吿短絀，則信用　礎亦必因之緊縮，如欲以銀代金，作爲膨脹信用與通貨之準備，而仍期幣制之健全者，實屬妄想耳。</p>
<p>中國之現狀</p>
<p>中國用銀爲本位，銀價波動，影響於經濟情形者至深且鉅。綜計美國購銀政策爲害於中國者計有二端：第一，使華幣對外滙價放長，巾塲梗塞；第二，銀幣外流，通貨緊縮，物價下落，貿易衰退，雖徵收銀出口稅及平衡稅，亦難奏效，白銀受海外高價之吸引，偷運蠭起，通貨益緊，形勢愈惡，銀行倒閉，接踵而至，瞻望前途，不勝危慄！</p>
<p>在美國購銀政策持續之下，中國情况，能否改善，誠屬疑問，尤以三月以後銀價續漲，形勢每况愈下，雖在華外商銀行，曾有紳士協定之訂定，不再運銀出口，以資遏止投機；然銀價愈漲，偷運愈盛，故存銀之能否保持，尙待實證。最後或足以誘致中國鈔票停兌之危險，流弊所及，危機叢生矣。</p>
<p>美國提高銀價之目的，在於提高中國之購買力，多購美國商品，證之事實，適得其反。據中美最近貿易統計所昭不，更覺事與願遠，本年一月份進口貨値較上年同月减少百分之十四，二月份則减少竟達百分之二十。</p>
<p>購銀政策之其他影響</p>
<p>購銀政策在增進中國地位之困難以外，被擾地域，更爲廣表。本年四月，與中國同樣用銀爲本位之墨西哥，受銀貴影響，擾動紛起，幣値提高，滙率激挺貿易衰退，銀幣私鎔，競運出口，墨政府之不能長此坐視，實堪預斷。旋於四月二十六日，果有禁鎔與禁運銀幣之命令，同時收回流通銀幣，代以紙幣，於是匯率方始回落，操縱自如。</p>
<p>以中墨兩國而論，墨西哥較占優勢，蓋該國係產銀之邦，銀價騰貴，首沾餘潤，即有出口，亦可以新產礦銀，作爲抵補。而中國則不然，銀旣流出，即爲永久之損失，果欲抵補，亦須以高價求諸海外。近聞墨政府頒布命令，對於新產礦銀，按照銀價之高下，分級徽稅，俾因銀漲而獲得之利益，政府亦得分嘗杯　也。然而墨西哥將來仍或被迫而採取管理通貨，致膨脹通貨，正與中國及他國孕育同樣之危機。</p>
<p>銀價續漲，則影響之流播愈廣，照目前之匯率計算，如銀價漲至每盎司一元〇二分，則西班牙之批西塔（西幣名），如溶爲銀塊價値反高。如銀價提高至一元〇六分，則印度之羅比，亦難逃同樣之命運。總此數端，使世界現狀，益趨紊亂，貿易阻滯，舉世渴望之滙兌安定，更難迅速恢復矣。</p>
<p>白銀用途减少後之結果</p>
<p>銀價高漲，迫使用銀國家脫離銀本位，改用紙本位，而銀市波動不息，尤足减弱銀爲貨幣之信仰，遠東用銀國尤無力再用銀爲貨幣，不得不另擇他種較廉幣材，作爲貨幣。中國與印度，爲銀之主要需求者，已往數年間，白銀均爲入超，於此我人應特加注意者，即在此次銀貴以前，巳有數國採取價値較低之鎳，作爲銀之代替品；良以鎳與銀有同一之功用，而價値較廉，故爲各國政府所樂用，銀價愈貴，用鎳愈多。總之用人力提高銀價，而不促進代巷品之用途，亦猶提高木材與橡膠水泥之價格，而不激起他種商品之競爭者，無是理也。</p>
<p>一言以蔽之，白銀之自然市塲，今已被美國銀政策破壞無遺，最後必至美國國庫，爲銀之唯一市塲。然則美國預定國庫總額百分之二十五之銀準備收購足額後，更將何如？美國顯然不能舉天下之存銀而盡購之，終至金被銀逐，一變而爲銀本位。故凡物過於提高價格，未有不招致自身之崩潰者，白銀之前途，正無二致也。</p>
<p>美車提高銀價，催殘我國金融商業，爲害之烈，無待贅述。本文係根據美國花旗銀行月報五月號編譯而成，全文反對美政府之購銀政策，論據始終一貫，對於用銀國之被累而演成恐慌，反覆申述，頗具卓見。意者美國銀行界與遠東市塲，實際接觸，較爲頻繁，眞情實况，聞見較切，故能認淸銀政策對於中國不良之影響，攻擊政府銀案之失策。觀次則知具有實際經騐之實務家，其見解較之閉門造車之白宮智囊，與惟利是圖之銀派分子，稍勝一籌矣。文安附誌，二四，八，五，於四行調查部</p>
<h3>美國棉業計劃的失策</h3>
<p>— 增椿</p>
<p>從一九三三年以來，棉花的消費一部份已呈復興的氣象。但美國久經建立的棉紡織業，不過在减退之中，稍有進步。這種原因在下述的情形中，是很顯明的，如日本中國及其他輸入棉貨的小國，因其棉織品的生產狀况順利，於是市塲上的供求也好像重行分配。在過去一年，日本對於印度及英屬東印度阿拉伯波斯等地的輸出，仍有繼續增加。所以以前幾年對於製造方法，比較新式的國家，營業日有增進，至於機器陳舊的，大多停留於停工狀態，及遭受生產過剩與價格低落之苦。</p>
<p>美匯政府以人爲的提高棉花價格，是不啻對於製造者困難的增加。於是世界消費量的復與，也受其阻礙。例如一九三三年竭力的减縮生產，以及斷然給與農民以每磅得借欵一角，美國次年又每磅增加爲一角二分。是美國政府在一九三三年旣將棉花價格提高一倍，更進而維持其較高的水準。本年仍舊繼續限制生產，如一月十七日美國農部長曾决定收獲量爲一〇·九八三·二六四包。如與一九三四年相比較，則爲九·七三一·〇〇〇包·一九三三年爲一三·〇四七·〇〇〇包。從此程决定之後，三月份的價格，曾一度低落。到四月份，才有一部恢復。其恢復的原因，係由政府宣佈將原定貸欵一角二分的計劃，到本年六月三十一日者，决定延長。如從美國農長的宣言觀之，謂將盡力予生產者以便利，而使物品在市塲上保持正規。但事實上對於本年收成，應有貸金着千，，至今尙未確定。</p>
<p>這種嚴厲的手段？其結果不過使美棉價格提高，自民的收入，也由一九三二年的四八四百萬元，增加至一九三三年之七一七百萬元；及一九三四年之七五六百萬元。至如農民補償支付的所得，一九三三年爲一六三百萬元，一九三四年則爲一一七百萬元。</p>
<p>受美國政府的棉花政策所影響到的，可分三方面。第一，美國廠商對於政府此舉，表示頗爲不滿。因爲棉花價格的提高，及竭力顧及生產者的利益，而向廠商方面征收手續稅，使營業的週轉及利潤均受影響而衰退。再則，其結果爲製造成本的增加。美國雖有維持水準的關稅，但進口棉貨仍屬有利可圖。因此美國自日本進口之棉貨，由一九三一年之七八九·〇〇〇平方碼，增至一九三三年之一·一一六·〇〇〇平方碼。一九三四年增加到七·二八七·〇〇〇平方碼。且因棉價的增高，徒使世界消費减少，另一方面間接促進各國自行增加棉產。所以美國棉花在世界生產的地位，已由一九三二年的百分之五四·九，跌至一九三四年的百分之四三·〇。如果美棉依然維持此等價格的水準，則地理上的重行分配的傾向，尙有繼續的趨勢。如巴西的棉產，巳由一九三二年之三九六·〇〇〇包（每包五百磅），增至一九三四年之一·二〇〇·〇〇〇包。埃及以前亦如美國决定限制，不過埃及的產量已由一九三二年之九九一·〇〇〇包，至一九三三年增爲一·七一五·〇〇〇包·一九三四年一·五六〇·〇〇〇包。同時中國之產量亦由二·二二八·〇〇〇包，增至二·九二七·〇〇〇包。（未完）</p>

<h3>環境與藝術</h3>
<p>— 佛朗</p>
<p>這里「瓖境」兩個字，當給它一個解釋，就是：它幷不像泰納專指自然環境而言，而是更廣義地指社會環境，卽是社會的各穩絛件。</p>
<p>藝術自由論者往往否認藝術的社會性，把藝術遊離了社會生活，作爲獨立的超現實的東西，這是可笑的偏見。不知藝備品究竟是人前思想感情的產物，而不是憑空從天掉下來的東西；社會環境即决定了人的意織，因此通國藝品的思想與感情，也就不能不爲特定的社會環境所限制；換言之，藝術作品，它必然會反映出那特定社會的生活形態。無論一個作家，他是有意地或無意地去創作，無論他應用在作品上的思想與技巧，有無限的自由，但他的意識却仍然爲社會所規定；藝術品是被决定於現實實的諸絛件下，它不能離開社會這許多條件的形成或限制而產生。</p>
<p>藝術旣爲社會環境所决定，它與某社會的發達形態是相結合的，就是說，在某一社會條件底下，必有某一特定的藝術，藝術將因社命環境的不同，而發生不同的實質。</p>
<p>試就古典主義，浪漫主義，自然主義，這三種文學的不同和怎樣被社會環境條件所决定，加以說明一下，便可知藝術以及文學與環境的密切的關係。</p>
<p>古典主義文學是在怎樣的社會環境中產生的呢？</p>
<p>中古時代，政治社會形態是建築在封建剝削制度上，當時封建貴族都是自鳴高貴上流的人物，他們是要求合理的禮貌，婉美的言談，舒適的享樂的，因此在那種社會環境便產生了嚴肅和諧的古典文學。古典文學的特質，就是莊生的，齊整的，內容務求優美婉轉，適合貴人的口胃。所以殘酷的事實，殺人的傷面，叫囂，熱烈的行徑，都悉數被排於外，這，我們祇要考察一下法蘭西的古典悲劇，便可知道。這種反映特反映別在造形藝術上表現得深刻。曼沙爾（Mansar）等的壯嚴華麗的建築，以及Le　Notne所設計的雄壯的庭園，凡爾賽宮殿裏的一切裝飾。都莫不表達出當時費族的精神，這種古典主義藝術，顯然是以宮延爲中心的，它是被决定於當時的社會諾形態而產生。</p>
<p>到了經濟上的自由主義推動了法國革命，初興的資產階級在經濟上奪去了貴族的地位，政治上推翻了貴族的統治，在這種發展自由主義的環境底下便產生了浪漫主義的文學。浪漫主義文學是古典主義文學的內容和形式都改變過來的，前者是嚴肅，有規律，後者是熱情奔放，意志自由。悲艶的情死，英勇的決鬥，成爲作品中唯一的內容。囂俄的作品，可爲代表。</p>
<p>及至資產階級達到成熟期，產業完全機械化，資本家已穩定了他黃金地位，同時自然科學勃興，美麗的幻想便逐漸消失。在這種社會環境底下，浪漫主義的熱情便自然變而爲自然主義的冷觀」了，幷且資本不新集，一切都站在金錢上面，社會也就有許多醜惡的面相，和魔敗的缺憾，自然主義作品逐反映出這種狀態而以暴露黑暗爲其特質。</p>
<p>如上的分析，足以說明社會環境和藝術結合的關係。</p>
<h3>不俗的一羣（上）</h3>
<p>— 周文</p>
<p>「哈，我以爲你今天是赴了張先生那兒的約，不會賞駕來的了。哈哈，居然……」頭髮梳得油光的主人，滿臉堆着笑，向着面前的一個鬍鬚刮得精光，嘴唇周圍現出一圈靑色的蒼白臉說，同時伸出右手，五指伸直，請客人向里面走去。</p>
<p>「旣然我答應了你就當然要來的喏。」蒼白臉一面走，一面掉過笑臉來說。「本來今天張先生是特別親自坐了他的自備車很早就去請我的，可是他今天的客都是些生意人，談話總不離幾兩幾錢，唉唉，我和他們弄不來，你知道，那些所謂市……」到了這裏他突然含蓄地把最後的一個字收着。</p>
<p>頭髮油光的主人張開嘴怔一下，脚步幾乎一停；但他立刻大聲地笑了起來：</p>
<p>「哈哈，我也是遝麼……弄不來……和他們…所以我早就猜着你一定肯賞駕來的，因爲我今天這兒都是荷花詩社的朋友，大家都早就說要你來指導指導。不過，」他兩眼一閃，小心地向蒼白臉望一望。「不過，我今天附帶也請了兩位所謂生意人，不過——」</p>
<p>蒼白臉的耳朵微微紅一紅，但馬上張開嘴笑起來，伸手拍了主人的肩頭一下，打斷他的話：</p>
<p>「那你這兒又當別論了喏，何况——」</p>
<p>「是的是的。」主人連連搶着說。「不過這兩位雖是所謂生意人，但也不俗：一位是敝業王老板，他也能謅幾句詩；至於另一位劉老板，他最近打算也要做雜誌生意了，所以我今天特地—附帶請他來隨便談談。」他說到這裏，臉色忽然嚴重起來，低聲地把嘴唇凑到蒼白臉的耳旁說：「因爲我打算主編他一個雜誌……」</p>
<p>蒼白臉怔一下，—唔？「主編」？他？他腦子裏這麼一閃，便深深地望一望肩旁這主人的臉，同時彷彿看見一張報紙的廣吿，這主人的名字就居然擠在自己的名字前面！他便掉過臉來，伸起一隻手爪抓抓後腦勺，兩眼一睞一睞地問道：</p>
<p>「這劉老板就是我們前次在密斯特黃的席上遇見過的那劉—劉—劉甚麽的老板呵？」</p>
<p>「對咯對咯。」主人連連點頭說。「喏，圓圓的，胖胖的，就是那樣。他也說他很仰慕你這大詩人呢。」</p>
<p>「哦？」蒼白臉立刻高興地發出微笑，掉過臉來，兩眼深思地緊緊盯了主人的紅嘴唇好一會。</p>
<p>主人走着，臉色忽然騷動起來了，兩眼的黑白翻動了幾下，接着他的嘴唇便閃出一個微笑，動兩動，但他却把嘴唇緊閉住，竭力不使笑出來。</p>
<h3>夏底海濱</h3>
<h3>再談蚊子</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>我已經在自由談裏談過南宋詩人范成大的苦蚊一首詩，這首詩裏記出了那個時候熏蚊的事實。我想熏蚊决不是起於宋朝，正像蚊廚蚊帳一樣，乃是老早就有的事。記得在莊子讓王篇裏，說是越君逃避王位，躲到一個洞穴裏面，人民就用熏穴的法子把他熏出來。至今獵夫尋找洞居的野物，還是每每熏穴。要說熏蚊是老早就右的事，起碼一千年以前，人就知道熏蚊，這話想不會怎麽大錯罷。</p>
<p>在我們的故鄕，每當夏秋良夜，豆棚瓜架的旁邊，庭前階下的餘地，一家子人都在一起乘凉。蚊子哼哼的飛來，蒲扇拍着，應接不暇。倘用巴掌打去，蚊子早已飛開，倒打痛了自己。你想躺在竹牀上安睡一下，蚊子决不會講個人情。便是你有蚊帳，蚊子也會尋閒覓縫的飛進來，攪得你一晚睡不落枕。趙甌北有題爲「一蚊」的一首詩道：</p>
<p>六尺匡牀障皂羅，偶留微罅失譏訶。一蚊便攪人終夕，宵小原來不在多！</p>
<p>甌北這首詩雖然是含有敎訓意味的諷刺詩，可是帳子裏鑽進一個蚊子，就可以使你一晚不能睡覺，至少這在像我一樣患着神經衰弱症的人，竟是事實。我的厭惡蚊子不比平常，不是沒有理由的。回想我的幼年時代，住在鄉村，熱季的晚飯之前，熏蚊子是我的專職。香腸似的鋸屑蚊香熏了不够，就用稻草捆把，點火燒了，再用穀糠藿辣子（一種生草）堆上去，一股烏烟像烏龍矯夭一般的飛騰起來，蚊子就毫無抵抗的遠揚了。要是在食鼈的時候留下　骨，剖鱔的時侯留下鱔骨，搗成粉末，摻在穀糖裏，熏出烟來，更爲有用，蚊子觸着就紛紛的墜下。至於鋸層，就算從橡木鋸出的拿來熏蚊頂有効力，不過似乎不及除蟲菊罷了。</p>
<p>蚊子經過扇擈，烟熏，風吹，雨打，蝙蝠吃，還是不會絕種。據說這是樹上結的，這種樹叫做蚊母樹。又說是從一種鳥的嘴裏吐出的，這種鳥叫做　母鳥。我也懶翻得爾雅本草之類的書，總之古人曾有這一說。還有爾雅翼說，「蚊生草中者，吻尤利而足有花紋，吳興號豹脚蚊子」。蚊子是不是生在草中，也還待仔細觀察。不過豹脚蚊子是蚊子中最兇的一種，身軀比較別的蚊子要小一點，腿脚腰腹都有白色環紋，喙管尖長，刺整人很利害。陰賠的地方，汚　水邊，都是牠們的托足之所，我鄕俗語叫做糞蚊。據近人的研究，蚊子的幼蟲是汗水裏面的孑孓，變形成爲蚊子。所以滅蚊最好的方法，不使有汚水屯積，或者殺盡汚水中的孑孓。不過又有人說，傳染瘧疾的那種瘧媒蚊，牠的幼蟲每每生在溪流及新鮮的水裏，和普通蚊卵產在汚水的不同。這種蚊子觸角粗而短，翅有褐色斑紋，頭及胸部呈淡灰色，腹部淡綠，棲息的時候，一定要舉起她的後脚，斜置牠的軀體。人不小心，被這種蚊子可了從牠的喙管把一種極微小的毒菌注入人的皮膚，不但皮膚立刻紅痛起腫，倘若你的抵抗力弱，瘧疾的細菌就向你的血脈進攻，叫你患着瘧疾了。舊說人患瘧疾，是因瘧鬼纏人，韓愈有譴謔鬼詩。搜神記上說是「昔顓頊氏有三子，死而爲疫鬼，一居江水爲瘧鬼，一居若水爲魍魎鬼，一居人宮室，善驚人小兒，爲小鬼」誰知道使人　瘧疾的瘧鬼原是一穩蚊子呢！</p>
<p>有人說，可人吸血的蚊子是雌蚊，雄蚊專吸車木的汁液，是否如此，我沒有親自看過。又有人說，蚊子能嗚的是雄蚊，不鳴的是雌蚊。這一說有詩爲證，也是趙甌北的詩。詩云：</p>
<p>白鳥營營聚成陣，響或如雷滿堂震。豈知中有不鳴者，猝不及防巧伺釁。向來只解聞聲撲，無聲可聞便不覺。一朝撲得不鳴蚊，翹肖中有此陰惡。想當化機亭毒時，二氣已自潛分滋。一般形模兩般性，有聲者雄無聲雌。眼前習見孰留意，靜觀乃識同中異。由來無物無陰陽，此亦格物中一事。郤笑讀書八十年，格物僅在一蟲細！</p>
<p>依趙甌北說，不鳴的雄蚊也在可人了。趙老先生自笑讀書八十年，纔分別出蚊子的雌雄，好像以爲格物是瑣屑事。其實，他這種分別蚊子雌雄的方法是否可靠，還是疑問。說到格物，豈怕瑣屑？瑣屑到肉眼不能看見的生物也正要人研究。十九世紀法國科學家巴斯德，畢生研究空中之微生物，或名細菌，建立了徽菌學，從此纔知道白喉，赤痢，瘧疾，肺癆，疹痘，黑死，霍亂，恐水症等傳染病，都是由各種病菌作祟，同時他還發明細菌發酵作用，於釀酒造醋上大有貢獻。他又在醫學上發明了許多治療新法。科學上這些偉大的功績，都是從瑣屑的微生物研究得來的。從來中國的所謂格物君子，都只肯在書本上用功夫，趙甌北不肯誠意研究蚊子的雌雄，也就不足怪了。</p>
<h3>海邊的悲劇（六）</h3>
<p>— 法國巴爾扎克原著王堅生譯</p>
<p>那個好人柴勃拉梅——好像不幸的命運是註定了的——泛舟歸來，當他登岸時他看見一張小紙浮在水面上，他拿了起來送到他妻子面前，她認識這些字是她的親筆，頺然倒在地板上，柴勃拉梅默然不語，隨後就到娜克羅亦錫克去，在那地方，聽到他的兒子正在打着彈子，假使你把金子如數交回給我，我必將在門口守候着，並且以銀子代替牠酬勞你，」這位善良的婦人把錢幣交給他。柴勃拉梅收下了。「很好，」他說後就回去了。那件事又攪到滿城風雨。但是這就是我所知道的，其餘的史好各人臆測了。他吿訴他妻子準備把樓下的屋子整理淸潔。爐中燃起了火，點着二支蠟燭，火爐的一邊放着二隻椅子，另一邊放着一張櫈子。於是他吿訴他的妻子拿出他的結婚禮服，吩咐也穿起她的婚服來。他披上自己的衣服，當他穿好時，他找着他的兄北，他在外面防備嚴密，並且報吿他，如果在海濱沙灘的任何一邊——這一邊，和居輪第沼澤一邊，聽到聲響。當他料想他的妻子一定穿好了衣服時，他又踱進了屋子，實了他的槍彈，把槍藏在烟囪的角落裏。少頃，呷葵斯回來了，他是遲了，他已經狂欽濫賭一直到十點鐘，他被人家扶着走過下羅夫彭因突尖　。他的叔叔一聽見他在海濱沙灘上的沼澤帝邊呼喊時，就立刻抓牢。他一句話也不說的把他帶回來。當他進來時，他的父親指着那張橙子就說：「你坐在那兒。你現在是坐在你曾經觸犯的父母面前，他們要做你的審判者。呷葵斯開始哭號起來，因爲柴勃拉梅的面容上閃耀一種奇異而又堅决的神情。他的母親，坐得筆直。「假使你狂呌，身體移動一英寸，假使你不能如柱子一般的挺直坐在橙子上，」辟銳說，用他槍瞄準着他的兒子，「我必將如殺一條狗子般的來殺死你。」這位毫無可取的活寳貝却變成呆子一般的沉默，母親也不講一句話。「看着這兒，」辟銳問他兒子說「這兒有一張曾經用來包過一塊西班牙金洋的紙，這槐金幣是在你母親床中的，你的母親是唯一知道這塊金幣藏處的人；當我登陸進，我就發現了這張紙浮在水面上，你愉巧把——就在今晚上——這西班牙金幣送給老太婆佛勒朗，而你的母親，又沒有在床上找着她的金幣，請你解釋。」呷葵斯說他並未拿他母親的金幣，化在南突斯的，是他自已的錢。「那好極了！」辟銳說：你能證明給我們看麼？「我有錢。」「你沒有私拿你的母親的麼？」「沒有。」「你能對上帝發誓麼？」他將對天立誓，他的母親舉自望着他說：「呷葵斯我的孩子，小心點啊，不要立不眞實的誓願；懺悔吧；現在還來得及呢。」她哭泣了。「你是眞是個好孩子，」他說；你常常叫我左右爲難。」柴勃拉梅面色變爲蒼白。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>子女婚嫁問題的責任者</h3>
<p>— 非</p>
<p>前日本報本埠新聞內，載有自殺案件凡四，兩男，兩女，其三人自殺原因不明，大約不是爲了經濟壓迫，便是爲了情塲失戀，這種問題，不但本列中已發表不少的文字，便是他家報紙，也曾發表過不少高論，此處可以不談。</p>
<p>現在所欲談的，在此四件自殺案中的一件，甬人徐志惠者，向在菜市街某野味店當帳房，近年因婚嫁子女，，負債甚鉅，近爲債權者逼迫，無法擺布，因而仰藥自盡，這件事便是當前的切要問題。</p>
<p>近年來因婚嫁子女而債臺高築的人，不知多少，不但現在，卽從前亦是如此，但是從前在宗法社會制度下，男婚女嫁，須得父母作主，所謂「養兒不了掛肝腸」男大須婚女大須嫁，男女的婚嫁，全是做父母的責任，並且這責任是絕對無可推諉的，現在女子解放，婚姻自由，假定父母爲子女擇配，而未經子女的同意，這種婚約，便完全失其效能，從這一點看來，現在子女的婚嫁，其責任全在子女而不在父母。</p>
<p>我更以昨日某報的本埠新聞中舉一個例，江灣水電路廣肇中學學生簡立華，與某校女生何雪妹，自友誼而進於戀愛，對於婚姻問題，早已兩相默契，惟被雙方家長聞悉，阻止婚姻進行，簡大受打擊，乃偕何女士雙雙服毒自盡，近來因婚姻不遂而目殺的案件，可以說時有所聞，司空見慣，無足爲奇，這原是舉最近的一個例。這都是做父母不必去負責，而强要去負責的所造成的罪惡。</p>
<p>並且這個負責，不是輕易所能擔當的，替子女結了婚姻，已加重了不少負據，但是結婚之後，又不能使其不生育，則負擔還要加上一層，於是一人之身，旣欲子女敎育的負擔，還要子女和孫子孫女的負擔，這樣負擔的重大，恐一般做父母中能擔當得起這個責任的，能有幾人。</p>
<p>是以現在做父母的，只有擔當子女的敎育費，但是僅敎育費一項，父母能够擔當至大學畢業的，已不是容易的事，至於訂婚結婚問題，儘由他們自己來作主，他們自己估量能够養活一家生活。便去結婚，倘然不能，還是先應該解决職業問題，或讀書問題再講，所以現在東西各國，男子結婚的時期甚遲，也便是這個緣故，因爲一人負擔較易，而一家負擔較難。</p>
<p>至於買辦資產階級，本來富有的，原不在此例。所以在現社會制度之下，還要拿子女的婚姻問題，放在自己的肩上，簡直不明現在的法律和現在的社會情形，眞是蠢虫，因爲現在的法律，已不許你去負擔。現在的社會，已不能使你負擔。而在子女，又不要你去負擔，做父母的還要去負擔甚麽？</p>
<p>集團結婚制度，雖己减輕結婚的臨時費用，已屬不少，但日常的生活開支，究不能因集團結婚而完全省却，則生活的鞭子，依舊在自己身上驅策，所以只有自己結婚由自己來解决，子女結婚由子女來解决。</p>
<h3>蟬之二</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>上篇我只約略寫了一點蟬同我的幼年關係。現在，想再寫一點關於蟬的各方面。</p>
<p>所謂蟬有好幾種，一種是全身褐色的，身子較大，聲音也最大，駱賓王聞蟬詩：「四陸蟬聲唱，南冠客思深；不堪玄　鬢影，來對白頭吟…」恐怕就是指那種蟬。這種蟬在我們鄉下叫「知了」。另一種身子狹長，較小，淺藍色，在我們鄕下叫做「學斯帶」。再一種形如「知了」，但身子小得多，深灰色，在我們鄉下叫做「隱了」。所謂「知了」，「學斯帶』，「隱了」都是以牠的聲音來定名的。「知了」氣魄較大，富「男性」色彩。「學斯帶，聲音較脆，威覺最敏銳，一時不容易捉到，身了簡直漂亮得像一個二八年華的小姑娘，就是捉到了也不容易養活牠，但我特別喜歡這一種。「隱了」聲音最小，有「村姑」色彩，在我是不大喜歡的。</p>
<p>這裏，我想說蟬叫的時間性。當「困人天氣日初長的時候，從濃綠的樹蔭裏第一聲叫出來的總是「知了」，這一叫，就給你特別的感覺，你威到初夏來了，這聲音非常脆，非常嘹喨。反映在威覺上的是高興，是愉悅。等到「學斯帶」也叫出來時，「知了的聲音漸漸變得重了，尤其在午後，火熱的太陽幾乎灼焦人的腦袋，汗如雨點那樣滴下來，你只覺得軟軟的，懶懶的，沒奈何的想睡中覺，但那時的知了，聲總特別來得響，使你威到煩膩，彷彿所有的熱都是被牠翅子振動起來的。</p>
<p>「學斯帶」在白天不大高興叫的，在火熱的太陽下更不高興叫。在東天剛放紅光時，在，一切睡夢中時，持別叫得起</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>勁，再不然便是晚上了，當日落西山時，學斯帶」也叫得特別起勁的。有時在較熱的月明之夜，也會琅琅的叫起來，「學斯帶」倒是夏天的詩人呢。</p>
<p>在雷雨將來時，天悶得人喘不過氣來，那時的「知了」，「學斯帶，「隱了」便要來一個叫的總動員。在蜻蜓滿天飛之下，蟬聲是嘈雜的一片，但這情境，我並不喜歡。我喜歡在秋天的下午，一片蒼茫的落日愈來愈大，愈大愈紅，秋風帶着凄凉味掠過樹際，晚烟一縷縷，一縷樓，像夢樣的　忽，那時有一二隻「知了」拖長了聲音叫起來，若斷若續的似乎遠在天邊。假設你是一個詩人，你定要被這種凄凉味所襲倒的。在四年前我曾寫過兩句詩：「蟬鳴秋柳外，烟亂晚風中」。就是想描摹那種情境的，但何嘗描摹到萬一。</p>
<p>黃仲則的所謂「蟬到吞聲尙有聲」大概就是指這種殘蟬。因爲這聲音幾乎只有一縷了，如殘絲那樣軟，如秋風吹蘆葦那樣凄凉。</p>
<p>秋風一到，殘蟬連殘聲也沒有了，緊抱着霜裏的枯枝，讓風雨來剝蝕。想到這個結局，更想到臨風高唱時的傲慢，我像嘆息一個薄命詩人那樣頗想弔念弔念緊抱着枯枝的殘蟬的軀殼了。</p>
<h3>「貝蒂蒲」的面型</h3>
<p>— 流水</p>
<p>從日本回來的友人，送給我一件可愛的禮物，那是電影中時常看見的天眞的面孔——貝蒂蒲」的泥塑面型。</p>
<p>在她那圓而黑的瞳子裏，是蘊藏着永恆的天眞。在她那鮮紅的嘴唇中，含着毫無盧偽的微笑。在她那　着笑渦的雙頰上，印着一朵淺色的玫瑰。她有金黃色的捲髮，頸上束着藍白色的緞帶。</p>
<p>於是，我把她掛在床頭的壁上，她永遠裝着頑皮的笑臉。</p>
<p>我時常呆望着她，那早已失去了的，好像遼遠到相隔幾個世紀了的模糊的童心，又在我爲生活擠得衰老了的心房中再生了。</p>
<p>每天，當我生活掙扎得全身無力時，我便倒在床上，把手墊着頭頸，望着她那睜得又大又圓的天眞的黑瞳子。在那瞳子裏，我重溫了一個夢。那是在悠久到不知多少時候以前的一個天眞的夢。夢中的事物已經非常朦朧，朦隴到和一張相底感到了陽光一樣。捉摸不到一點眞實的東西。我閉起眼睛，極力地回索，好像逆着一條銀色的小河到上流去找尋一件失去了的珍貴的東西。然而，那是飄渺的，捉不住輪廓的夢。……</p>
<p>在對樓的窗口，時常出現着一個孩子的臉，他（或者是她）每次都木然地望着地下，或者看着我。幾次，我想從這孩子的面孔中重溫一下失去了的童年的事跡。於是，我對他笑，對他招手，懷着一顆自以爲天眞的心。然而，孩子依舊木然。他不能了解對樓的一顆心，他用疑惑的目光望了一刻，便回過頭走了。</p>
<p>這回，輪到我木然立着，我明瞭，自己的童心早已消滅了。我們雖然相隔祗十多尺，但是，我們的心境已相隔着一個量不出來的距離，那樣地遙遠，遙遠……於是，我無奈地祗好讓心情一天天地和蒼老相近，和一個扶杖的老者在黃昏的歸途中一樣。</p>
<p>不知在那個一早晨，我把那隻泥塑面型從壁上拿下來，用手摸弄着，在窗口呆立着，心裏空洞得沒有一點東西在那裏停留，凝望着遼遠的天空。忽然，我聽到一串天眞的笑聲，晨風中的銀鈴似的笑聲；那是對樓孩子的笑聲。而且，他在對我招手。我立刻就明白了，他在對手中的「貝蒂蒲」的面型招手。</p>
<p>於是，每天，我都拿着「貝蒂蒲」的面型和對樓的孩子招手，微笑。我藉此忘郤一切成年的煩惱。對樓的孩子從此不和我疏隔了。</p>
<p>但是，今天我從外面回來，發現。貝蒂蒲」的面型粉碎了。破碎地散落在床頭。我黯然，拿起瓦碎片給對樓的孩子看，他郤呆了一陣，猛的「哇」地哭了。</p>
<h3>洱海初秋夜</h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>洱海灘！那兒，彷彿是塵外的潔美的夢境地。那兒，深印着我無限的純眞的心魂。敎我如何不懷念呢？像個已消失的美夢，一顆沉醉在美夢裏的心，亦杳渺無處尋了！殘留在胸懷裏的，是剩些追憶的，惆悵的感懷。美景是剎那間便過逝了，跟着來的是難以忘却的哀情；人生的旅程上，便是這麽忽促，變幻。遙遠困累的旅程上，悶得我窒息，連追憶的心情，時常都給接棄。然而，秋風又起了。酸的胸，軟的脚，使我不能不凄然的，給秋風撩起舊情！</p>
<p>一顆心，碎裂得像給殘踏而理的落花股，是難以追尋了！於是，我只能說：那顆心，大概是沉沒在洱海底去了吧！那玉洱的碧水裏！</p>
<p>秋風又起了，吹不起那顆沉沒了的心；但却泛起洱海上無數的漪漣的碧波。</p>
<p>『呵，新秋的洱海，天上初出浴的美人似的洱海的臉容！縱然，那顆心是難以追尋了！可是，新秋的洱海，我怎能忘却呢！』</p>
<p>那是値得歌咏的大自然；不，是我最潔眞的故人。牠，惟右牠是永遠地潔眞，永遠的秀美！永遠地値得人們懷念。任風雨摧殘，牠是仍舊潔美不變；而善變的人們的心，却是可怕！哦，把可怕的忘去吧！</p>
<p>「家住洱海濱，不知人間苦，」那時節……</p>
<p>呵，記起來了！七月十五的民間佳節。從中秋夜忘懷一切的賞過皎皎的玉盤似的秋月後，洱海，秋月，便是我整個心兒留變的去處。從上弦月望到下弦月，從新秋的輕盈的碧波着到殘秋的玉洱浪。</p>
<p>玉洱的春水盈盈，極是迷人，東風溫醇，殆如醉酒；可是，我更愛初秋的洱海，碧水是盈盈得更覺多情，再添幾分越發淸秀的容姿，上下的氣魄，更是高爽澄淸，天，水，月，人，都蒙上一層新淸的歡情。洱海的初秋，是另一個新生的人間世呵！我的心情也新生了。</p>
<p>春花秋月，尤其洱海的新秋月，映得人間，活像個新裝的美人在樓頭期待，那淸新，澄潔皎美的銀化的景色，那輕盈，那欲舞欲歌的歡情……</p>
<p>初秋的風，夾着輕微寒意；但正蓄着無限柔意，使人感到生的溫慾。徘徊在洱海濱，從這不同的天色，風，月，水，很淸楚的辨別新秋的美人兒；淸楚的覺到天地與人間的眞實的存在。</p>
<p>薄暮輕淡的，遲遲的，從山頭籠置下來，洱海濱的人，給漸更靜謐的氣息溶得凝神不已，那時侯，雖然夜姍姍而來了；可是大理的夜，沒有深黑可怕的情景；只是慢慢的，人會發出驚喜的歡呼或者贊嘆的低聲——呵，那金盤，那新月！</p>
<p>遠遠望去，碧綠的洱海波，如一帶鮮美的綠葉，輕盈，飄逸，自如，生氣躍然的心情油然滿腔。夜的新秋風飄得人要融化了，很自然的登上一葉輕舟，人像睡在甜夢中隨柔風碧水浮去，碧水上，便是我的家，我的理想中的美人的酥胸溫懷。這時候，人生的什麼什麽，全然是身外事了。</p>
<p>遙飄去，漂白的雲圍間，透出淡黃色來，像一個潔凈的臉孔閃着光，漸漸的，淡黃色漸濃漸廣，彌漫染變，金霞像花朵散佈在天邊，天邊由高潔而閃光，而金輝，而鮮明。海與天邊，一片迷醉人的美絕的夜色，使人飄飄欲追上去。追尋到天邊去呵！</p>
<p>四望洱海，靜謐如深林的氣息下，普映着皎皎的銀光，紗衣，換上了婆娑的銀色浴衣。洱海上，碧波點綴着無限的閃閃着光輝的金銀色澤，像玉帶隨風飄，像萬點金子在波上。舟子上的人會私私對着天邊和海說：永遠睡在你的胸懷吧？然而，嘗幾何時，人是隔絕在天涯地角。洱海，你何在？夢般的人生……又是秋風起了！</p>
<h3>鳥虫篇</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>偶然記起一句「以鳥嗚春。」可是，每年的春天，我總不太聽見「鳥」在樹枝頭上「鳴，」——很宛轉地唱出淸脆悅耳的迎春的歌曲。除了關在籠子裏，掛在大戶人家的客堂里或房子里供人玩賞娛情的黃鸝和鸚鵡，有時在淸晨或午後的沈寂靜穆的空氣里隨意地歌唱着一兩支小調兒，來助人們的淸興？調齊人們的精神上的疲倦。然而，牠偶爾的一兩聲歌唱，似乎不是「鳴春」，更談不到「報春」，就是在嚴寒的雪天裏，牠也還會悠閒自在地歌唱起來，牠的歌唱，那不過隨意地舒展一會喉嚨，來一下玩意兒罷了。這些鳥兒，終生給人們餵養在大戶人家的暖室里，像家畜似的，飽暖悠閒，一點顧慮都沒有，早已失掉了牠的本來的性靈了。因此，鳴春的鳥，自然不是指這些失却自由給人餵養在暖室里的「家鳥」了。此外，小麻雀兒到了春天，表面上似乎呈着一種喜悅的表情，在屋簷下蹦蹦跳，啁啁啾啾　低語，然而，聲音的瑣瑣碎碎，又短促又不淸脆，聽起來未免有點不大動聽，至於烏鴉，終年咿咿呀呀地吵得要命，牠的聲音，一聽見就叫人討厭！而且牠的叫聲是不分春，夏，秋，冬的，卽使是六月的大毒熱天，或是雨雪霏霏的嚴冬的季節，牠還是咿呀的吵個不停，簡直跡近搗亂的樣子。除此之外，每年的春天，我是不大聽見其他的什麼遨遊於宇宙之間的鳴春的鳥，給我報告春的消息了，這也許是居住在都市里，隔離大自然界太遠了的緣故吧？就是幾年前我居住在第二家鄉的南國—暹羅—的山巴里，每天都可以瞧見在綠蔭深處的杈枒上跳躍着的拖長着顏色美麗的長尾巴的不知名的小鳥，有時牠也伸長了脖子，高高興興地唱着好聽的歌曲，可是，牠的歌唱也是不分四季的，這也許是環境使牠不知道什麽叫做春天，因爲南國一年四季都沉在炎熱的氛氣裏，壓根兒就沒有所謂春天吧，所以，「以鳥嗚春」的這一句古話，至今還無緣領悟，悵然的很！</p>
<p>「以鳥鳴春」旣然無緣領悟，而另一句古話：「以虫鳴秋」，却深深地體味了。每當夏末秋初的季節，這時正是虫類的世界，紡織娘，「知了」，蟬，……在牆根下，樹技頭，吱吱啾啾喧叫的多麽熱鬧。尤其是在恬靜的午後，陣陣微微的薰風，拂得人們像喝了過度的酒量似的，無聲無息軟棉棉地沈到睡鄉里去的時候，紡織娘的吱吱像紡織機發出來的聲音似的叫聲，曳長而又宏亮，懶散散地爬過窗口來，喚醒人們的酣夢，記得兒時，每當午睡的時侯，我時時給牠的吱吱的叫聲吵醒了，因此，我總有點感到不愉快，揉着惺忪朦朧的睡眼，對媽媽問道：「這是什麼虫聲呢」？媽媽却和顏悅色的回腔：「是紡織娘，——　　推醒那班懶散貪睡的娘兒們，趕快起來舫織呀！」但，至今，我對於紡織娘的叫聲還是不會發生好感，這也許是我的固執的僻性的作祟了吧。其次就是那些給人們關在小竹籠里當作玩具般的沿途挑賣給小孩子玩要的「知了」，牠雖則也會鏗鏗鏘鏘地叫着好聽的聲音，在岑靜的辰光里，有音韻地鳴奏着，然我總威得牠的命運有如「家鳥」，畢竟是可憐的！在虫類中給我發生好感的莫如蟬，尤其是秋將殘了的鳴蟬，牠的一聲聲斷斷續續的叫聲，宛如經過一生的磨練，已走到衰邁的境界了；因此，牠那叫出來的聲音，多少帶有一點兒嘶啞和凄凉，彷彿不勝生活綫上的磨折，同時，又飽含着辛酸苦澀的氣味。雖然這聲音我有聽怕點，但我却又喜歡聽這帶有點兒警敕的叫聲。每當滂沱的驟雨過了之後，，嬌媚的太陽重嵌在碧玉似的藍天里，這時大地上的一切格外地顯着新鮮的景象，於是，你倚靠窗檻，悠閒地瞧望窗外的晴朗的藍天，和閃着金光的靑葱的樹葉，靜聆着一兩聲斷斷續續的鳴蟬孤奏着，這倒是一種新鮮的詩景，而使你的胸懷頓威到無限的舒快呵！現在又是到了「鳴虫」的季節了，好吧，我們就靜聆虫兒的吱吱啾啾，快快樂樂地高唱低吟吧。</p>

<h3>奔投（上）</h3>
<p>— 金光</p>
<p>一重山又一重山，一道水又一道水，一個一個的村莊，在他們疲憊的脚下過去了；他們作了無歸宿的奔投。————他們是一羣無家可歸的難民。</p>
<p>老的，少的，男的，女的，他們一共是八十多個。洪水噬吞了他們的家鄉，噬沒了他們的家人，噬沒了他們家鄉的一切，却留下一羣殘餘的他們；可是也只得向陌生的道路上，作了沒歸宿的奔投。</p>
<p>他們經過了許多村莊，經過了許多古鎮，祇是一連串的『搶堤！搶堤！』，使他們沒有膽量在一個村莊裏留下，儘是向南趕過哪一叢遠密的森林。。過多的樹材會阻欄洪水的泛濫。</p>
<p>現在他們有一百八十多個向伴了，那一百多個，是沿途跟着來的別村的難民。</p>
<p>無邊際的薄暮，在秋的荒凉的原野上偷偷地伸了起來，一個大的凄凉，鎖住了一羣人疲憊的心，夜已經潛伏在前面灰色的林子裏了。各人的心裏浮起一個自然的反應；祇是不肯說出來，任牠纏住疲憊的心作加速的跳動。——『今天又要趕夜路了！』</p>
<p>一陣小孩子的哭聲，亂了大人的心腸；隨着一陣太息，歸鴉把他們帶進更蒼茫的黃昏；癡望着那一片佈滿黑色雲塊的天空下，是洪水吞噬了的故鄉；一陣心酸，痛苦在他們的心上打了個烙印。</p>
<p>一步一步的，這羣人走進了森密的樹林，他們看着夜的羅網從黑色的樹根下張了起來，一陣陣駭人的西風簌簌地，零亂的吹下半地半殘了的葉子，經騐吿訴他們，是一個恐怖的夜已伺候在他們的前面了；一陣寒慄，亂了各人的心緒。</p>
<p>夜的羅網重電的張上，冥色中失掉了兩旁的樹木，失掉了脚底下的路；每個人都看不淸楚己身以外的一切，只是小心地跨開二條腿，拖着一身的疲勞，低着頭，裝着鎭靜，向這秋的凄凉的林子裏，作希望的探索；可是一陣陣雜沓的脚步聲，和急促的呼吸聲下隱藏着的，却是寒慄和失望。</p>

<p>繁華風景說申江。紙醉金迷富貴鄕。到晚來，電炬通明如自晝。蛇神牛鬼盡登塲。洋塲素號銷金窟。有一班，富家公子女紅妝。穿的好衣裳。住的大洋房。進出隨身車一輛。如飛來去好風光。賣貴光陰閒裏過。用錢支給有爺娘。花天酒地無拘束。忘形浪跡任徜徉。有的是。影戲院中携愛侶。舞塲摟抱美姑姑。有的是。平康賣笑千金擲。達旦通宵樂未央。有的是，男女雙雙開旅館。豳期密約赴高唐。還有那。輪盤賭。跑狗塲。回力球。花會打。一夜工夫賭幾塲。尋常消遣义麻雀。一千塊底小白相。如此繁華如此夜。胡天胡地太荒唐。揮霍金錢如糞土。縱有，萬金家業亦勿久長。到頭來。身敗名裂黃金盡。自作孽來自遭殃。只好。水門汀上寫文章。</p>

<h3>「自由神」中兩新人</h3>
<p>—施超與藍蘋—</p>
<p>昨晚，得先看了電通新片『自由神』的會　試映，深深地被全部劇情感動，各人的演技　激着，就是新人施超，也有驚人的表演，寳叔塔下，跟王瑩絮絮地談情，對襯他致力革命時的激昂憤慨，以至病歿醫院時的慘狀，顫慄的手，悽慘的音調，感動人的心懷，刺激人的視綫。至於他的流暢的國語，使人更有悅耳的愉快，在聲片運動中，該是値得注意的一員新人。</p>
<p>藍蘋，她是話劇界中的健將，今年娜拉的兩度公演，在技術上獲得了更美滿光榮的評價。這次在「自由神」中，雖初上銀幕，飾一員女兵，戲雖少，却顯出了她的身份，假使與演娜拉時相對比，前者爲活潑快活的小鳥兒，後者爲一頭威烈的雄獅子，一則輕鬆有趣，一則激昂奮發，姿態雖不同，感人却司樣地深刻。</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Orders Zhang Qun to Urge Wang Jingwei, Who Agrees to Return to Nanjing Within Days; Chiang Kai-shek Sends Personal Letter to Wang; Return Date to Be Determined Within Three Days; Wang Jingwei's Surface Illness Has Healed, but Underlying Condition Remains; Plans to Assume Position as Central Standing Committee Member Exclusively</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Political News: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek dispatched Chairman Zhang Qun of Hubei Province to Qingdao by plane on the 17th, representing his condolences and urging Wang Jingwei to return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over political affairs. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) After Zhang Qun personally delivered Chiang Kai-shek's letter to Wang Jingwei, Wang agreed to return to Nanjing immediately. The date of Wang's return will be determined tonight, and it is said that he will leave within three days. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi flew from Qingdao to Nanjing at 11:15 AM on the 18th. According to his conversation with Central News Agency reporters at the airport, President Wang's surface illness has healed, so he is able to travel outside for a while. However, the underlying condition has not healed, so his intention to resign remains firm. Wang indicated that as soon as the Central Government approves his resignation from all concurrent posts, he will come to Nanjing to serve exclusively as a member of the Central Standing Committee. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has again sent Zhang Qun to Qingdao to visit Wang and inquire about his health. Zhang arrived in Qingdao by plane at 5:45 PM on the 17th and met with Wang that evening. At 8:00 AM on the 18th, Zhang went to Wang's residence again, and Sun Ke was also present. They discussed matters together. I left Wang's residence at 8:30 AM on the 18th to go to the airport to depart, so I do not know the outcome of the talks between Wang and Zhang, or whether Wang will leave Qingdao within days. My return to Nanjing is to preside over the swimming competition. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Shen Honglie accompanied Zhang Qun to visit the city's construction and scenic historical sites on the morning of the 18th. In the afternoon, they went swimming in the sea together. In the evening, Zhang was hosted at a banquet at the Yingbin Hotel. According to Zhang, he came here on the orders of Chiang Kai-shek to persuade President Wang to stay in his position. He has visited Wang and conveyed his sincerity. Wang agreed to return to Nanjing in the near future. Zhang is scheduled to return to Wuhan the day after tomorrow. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, flew from Shanghai to Qingdao on the 17th to inquire about President Wang's health. He returned to Nanjing by China National Aviation Corporation plane on the afternoon of the 18th. Chu issued a written statement, saying that President Wang's illness has healed, so he is able to go out for a walk to get some fresh air, but the underlying condition has not healed, so his resignation is very firm. According to President Wang, as soon as the Central Government approves his resignation from all concurrent posts, he will come to Nanjing to serve in the Central Standing Committee. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Chu Minyi flew to Nanjing on a China National Aviation Corporation plane at around 9:00 AM on the 18th. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Our Country Has Not Borrowed Money From England; Foreign Reports of 5 Million Pounds Are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After British Commissioner Ross left London, foreign newspapers in Shanghai suddenly reported that China had borrowed 5 million pounds from England, and that Ambassador Guo Taiqi had contacted the British side and an agreement would soon be reached. According to financial circles, this rumor is for international atmosphere and is absolutely not true. China's current finances do not need to borrow foreign debt to improve the economy, and construction is also carried out in a progressive manner, gradually increasing. If there is a need to borrow money, it must be approved by the Central Government's careful decision, and then the competent authorities will contact the lending country. It cannot be so hasty. Although Britain, the United States, and other countries have sent commissioners to China to inspect China's economy and contribute as a basis for improvement and reference, they still focus on their own commercial interests. It is their initiative and not at the invitation of our country. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Real Culprit in the Liu Case Is Still Being Strictly Pursued</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said: (1) The new commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, Tada Hayao, will arrive in Tianjin on the 19th. I will invite him to a banquet on a regular basis to fulfill the duty of a host. (2) The deadline for apprehending the murderer in the Liu case has expired. Although several suspects have been arrested, none of them are the real culprit. I have ordered the competent authorities to continue the strict pursuit. (3) The bandit suppression affairs in this province will be carried out in three zones. The rumors of changes are inaccurate. (4) The date of my return to Baoding has not yet been determined. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Yuguan said that a certain secretary-general of Liu Zuozhou was recently detained in Yuguan by a certain party for unknown reasons. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Purpose of the Bandits in the Shihe Train Robbery Case Was Property; More Than 10,000 Yuan in Cash Was Coveted by the Bandits</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Railway Bureau sent personnel to investigate the Shahezi train robbery case on the Beining Railway and determined that the bandits' purpose was to rob property. It was because someone was transporting more than 10,000 yuan in cash on the train, which was known to the bandits. Therefore, they boarded the train together and robbed it midway, and then fled eastward to Shihe. Now, in addition to increasing the police force escorting the train, the Railway Bureau has also sent letters to various agencies to jointly arrest the bandits. The dead and wounded employees have been given compensation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Railway Bureau sent personnel to investigate the train robbery case on the Beining Railway and determined that the bandits' purpose was only property. It was because someone was transporting more than 10,000 yuan in cash on the train, which was taken advantage of by the bandits. Therefore, they boarded the train together and robbed it midway, and then fled eastward to Shihe. Now, in addition to increasing the police force escorting the train, the Railway Bureau has also asked all parties to jointly arrest the bandits. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the case of the robbery of the Ping-Shen train, five important suspects in the train robbery case were arrested on the 17th in places such as Xianguan, Qindaohai County, and Tangshan. They were sent to Tianjin for interrogation that day. (Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin sent Police Inspector Gao Pu to Qinhuangdao to investigate the Shihe train robbery case. The Beining Railway police searched and found that the five river robbers had fled out of the pass via the Da Jiao Mountain. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Political Reorganization Committee Telegraphs to the Provincial Government to Investigate the Circumstances of Jones's Death; Jones's Remains Will Be Transported to Zhangjiakou; British Military Officer Miller Has Gone to Baochang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After receiving the official report of Jones's murder, the Political Reorganization Committee yesterday sent Zhang Jianchu, the section chief of the committee, to the British Embassy to express condolences for Jones's death. At the same time, it also urgently telegraphed to the Chahar Provincial Government to investigate the circumstances of Jones's death as soon as possible. However, as of this afternoon, Beiping has not yet received a reply from the Chahar Provincial Government. It is said that the German reporter Miller has also gone to Baochang to meet Jones's remains. After Jones's remains are transported to Baochang, all circles in Zhangjiakou will hold a memorial service. After the meeting, Jones's body will be transported to Beiping. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the British reporter Jones was torn up by bandits, the German reporter Miller, who was kidnapped at the same time as Jones and has now escaped danger, telegraphed to the Political Reorganization Committee last night, saying that Jones's body was found in Cao Jiafangzi near Baochang and was discovered by a car driver in Baochang. He immediately reported to the Baochang police, and it has now been confirmed that it is indeed Jones. The British military officer Miller stationed in Zhangjiakou has rushed to Saichang to identify the body and will be able to transport Jones's body to Zhangjiakou tomorrow, etc. The reporter learned from various sources about the circumstances of Jones's death. After Jones was kidnapped by the bandits, the Chahar Provincial Government immediately sent Zhang, the platoon leader of the Baochang Special Police Team, to rescue him and negotiate the ransom and other conditions with the bandits. He traveled back and forth several times and worked extremely hard. Unexpectedly, the bandits shot Zhang in the last time he went to the bandit's lair. Later, because the security team tracked down and suppressed them, Jones was still taken to the mountains to flee. They had to change their residence every day. Jones was exhausted and hoarse. Because the bandits lived in the deep mountains, there was a severe shortage of food. Jones was accustomed to a life of luxury, so he could not eat his fill at every meal, so his body felt more and more weakened. On the day he died, he was taken to a high mountain by the bandits again in the early morning. After walking to the hillside, he ran out of strength and suddenly fell into a coma and could not walk. Therefore, the bandits became impatient and fired three shots in a row, killing Jones. Afterwards, they moved his body to Cao Jiafangzi near Baochang, which was only discovered by a car driver the day before yesterday. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Investors Develop Xinglong Gold Mine; Hebei's New Budget Has Not Yet Been Prepared</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Daxiao Daoliushui Gold Mine in Xinglong County is now being developed on a large scale by Japanese investors Kimura Goro and Narita Tsutomu with a capital of 10 million. The Rehe Xinglong Gold Mining Co., Ltd. has been established. The head office is located in Changchun, and the president is Yang Jue Maogawa Kuanji.

<h3>Hidden Reefs in the Future of the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>— Note</p>
<p>Since March and April of this year, there have been rumors of the revival of the London Naval Disarmament Conference. In mid-May, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was formally established, and Germany's possession of 35% of the British Navy was accepted by Britain. The naval ratio system previously insisted on by Britain was also automatically declared abolished. As a result, British and Japanese opinions became increasingly close, and the voice of the revival of the naval conference also rose. According to news from London, the British government has notified the ambassadors of the four countries, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy, between the 3rd and 8th of this month, suggesting that an informal naval conference be convened in October to prepare for the future formal conference. The content of the conference also proposes two points: "abolishing the naval ratio system" and abandoning the previous claim to limit the total tonnage, and instead agreeing to the qualitative limitation. Although this official document of the United Kingdom is not a formal petition, we can infer from the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty that a second naval conference should be convened by the contracting states within one year after one of the contracting states issues a notice of abandonment to conclude a new treaty. The argument for reconvening the naval conference seems credible and subtle.</p>
<p>What we want to discuss at present is the nature of the current naval conference, and secondly, the hidden reefs in the future. First of all, in terms of the nature of the problem, the current naval conference is complicated by the shape of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. When the preparatory meeting for the London Naval Disarmament Conference was held last year, the scope of its discussion was centered on the Pacific issue, and the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan were the overall rules. The naval problems in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean are more serious, and the countries involved must include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Russia. At present, the focus of the United Kingdom on naval issues seems to be in Europe, and the connection between European naval issues and Pacific naval issues makes the entire naval disarmament issue an inseparable contradiction.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of the hidden reefs in the future, it is very difficult to overcome numerous obstacles. To mention the major ones, "the British and Japanese views on the abolition of the ratio system are consistent, but Japan takes national defense security as its basic principle and is quite indifferent to the British proposal to stipulate the maximum tonnage and gun caliber of warships of all classes. Secondly, in order to maintain the European peace mechanism, the United Kingdom insists that the naval conference should invite Russia to participate. This has been opposed by the Japanese government. As for the principle of ship construction notice proposed by the United Kingdom, Japan believes that there is no need for it in fact." The United States is quite cautious and hesitant about the naval conference issue, and in essence, its principle of maintaining a 5:5:3 naval ratio remains unchanged. The famous American naval strategist, Vincent, publicly stated that the United States' future naval policy is that for every three ships built by Japan, the United States must build five ships. Some congressmen also believe that the abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty is actually beneficial to the United States because the clause stipulating that no fortifications will be added to the Pacific will be cancelled together. This kind of position of the United States is a manifestation of its naval isolation policy. Seeing this situation, the United States' participation in the naval conference will only add to the disputes. The detailed plan of the German navy's ship construction program is quite ambiguous, and the public opinion of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Russia is stunned by it. As a result, the United Kingdom's naval negotiations with France, Italy, and Russia have also encountered hidden reefs. France aims to first obtain the safety of the French fleet in the North Sea, while the Soviet Union proposes a plan to guarantee the safety of the Baltic Sea, believing that the United Kingdom should allow respect for the neutrality of the Danish Strait in wartime. This kind of proposal is actually difficult for the United Kingdom to accept.</p>
<p>The above three are the main hidden reefs in the future of the naval conference. The main hidden reefs must be broken first, and then there can be talk of compromise among the countries to establish a new agreement. Otherwise, the final fate of the peace negotiations has come to an end, and the future of naval arms competition will be even more unimaginable.</p>
<h3>The Water Level in the Lianjiaba Area of Weishan Lake Rises Sharply; The Water Level in the Jing River and the Bulao River Are Both Level with the Banks; The Tong County Government Requisitions Labor to Build Dikes for Protection; The Dikes of Weishan Lake Are Already Showing Signs of Shaking</h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) At 7:00 PM on the 18th, there were torrential rain and strong winds here. It is believed that a part of the Yellow River water entering the Central Canal will inevitably flow faster along the canal, and the accumulated earthworks will inevitably be slightly affected. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water level in Lianjiaba has risen sharply, and the water flow outside the mouth is too fierce. The flow of the Jing River cannot keep up, and the excess flows back, circling around the outside of the west embankment. The water inside the inner embankment is three meters deep, and the inside and outside are surging, creating a dangerous situation. Shao Hanyuan ordered Wang Picheng and Zhao Yuxin to rush to cooperate with Wang Gong to supervise the construction and block the breach. The county government has requisitioned hemp bags and sealed off cars to transport them to Jiyong overnight for the dikes outside the mouth, the set dikes upstream of the Jing River, and the west dike of Weishan Lake. It is investigated that Lianjiaba is the south mouth of Weishan Lake. The Commissioner's Office, in order to accept the opinions of the representatives of Shandong Province and quickly discharge the Yellow River water in western Shandong, widened the mouth by eight meters, so the water flow is particularly fierce. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The west dike of Weishan Lake and Lianjiaba have been surrounded by the Yellow River water on both sides. On the nights of the 17th and 18th, there were more than 30 places of seepage and collapse. Fortunately, the officials and people blocked the breach quickly, so it did not breach, but the dike body has shown signs of shaking, and there are many cracks. If the Yellow River water rises again and washes away, it will be difficult to guarantee the dike. It is generally expected that there may be a risk of complete collapse within three to five days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The mouth of Lanjia Dam has been widened, and there is a large amount of water flowing down. The Jing River and the Bulao River are level with the banks both upstream and downstream, and are about to overflow. The Tong County government has gathered civilians and divided them into sections to set up signs and start building the dikes along the river on the 20th to prevent flooding. The reeds and earth dams in the river have been cut and removed by Zhang Yaxuan's team, and the water flow is smooth and rushing straight down. However, because there is too much water coming, it is still continuing to rise. The Commissioner's Office strictly ordered the river dikes to be built within three days. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Yellow River water is flooding the Central Canal, but because the flow is still slow, it is still seeking to go straight to the downstream. Jinyaosu is also level now, but the Yellow River water is still continuing to rise, and Weishan Lake is 13 centimeters higher, storing 3.5117 meters of water. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai, the chief engineer of the Water Conservancy Committee, in order to understand the actual situation of the Yellow River water intruding southward and inspect the Yellow River prevention project, is scheduled to depart for inspection on the 20th. He has telegraphed to the engineer stationed in Qingjiangpu to come to Nanjing to act as an agent for Beijing affairs. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Zunhua and Qian'an Counties Implement Joint Defense by Teams; Mounted Bandits in Shizha Disturbed Everywhere; After Being Suppressed, They Fled to Outside the Pass</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The four counties of Luanzhou, Luzhou, Zunhua, and Qian'an, because the bandits in each mouth of the Great Wall are like hair, all intend to intrude inward. Joint defense by teams will be implemented from the 17th, and pedestrians will be checked. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Yantian's unit of the Second Security General Team fiercely attacked the areas around the Iron Gate Pass and Xing'erling of the Great Wall on the 16th. The Li Laobao bandit gang relied on the dangerous terrain to resist stubbornly, and the artillery fire was fierce. Until 10:00 AM on the 17th, the bandits could not hold out and abandoned the positions, leaving many corpses and retreating to the vicinity of Xifengkou. Xifengkou was under special alert on the evening of the 17th. The Dongjiakou bandit gang planned to intrude inward from Xinglong because the Japanese army in Malan Valley was strictly guarding against them. On the 17th, Xinglong County Magistrate Li went to Tangshan to see Yin Rugeng and asked the security team to go to block and resist. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhanshan said that Ma Wufu led more than 3,000 bandits to intrude from Dongjiakou, intending to occupy Malan Valley. Dongjiakou has been looted by the bandits, and the situation is serious. Ordinary poor people and local ruffians have also joined the bandit team one after another, and the bandit forces are increasing day by day. Now, the counties of Xinglong, Zunhua, Qian'an, and Lulong along the Great Wall have all been placed under martial law, checking pedestrians, and the four gates are tightly closed. Most of the team police in the county towns have been transferred out. It is now heard that the bandit gangs in each mouth of the Great Wall and the so-called North China Army have all made contact. Because the strength of the Xinglong Militia and Special Police is weak, the bandits have surrounded and occupied all the districts and villages of Xinglong, and intend to spy on the Yulong Building and the Yulong Checkpoint. Xinglong County Magistrate went to Tangshan on the 17th to see Yin Rugeng, report everything, and ask for instructions on suppressing the bandits. The Luan-Yu District Office has divided the area and ordered each county in the district to concentrate the militia and special police to jointly suppress them. The special police Zhang Yantian and Zhang Qingyu have also sent 1,000 team police each to Xinglong to suppress the bandits. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Rugeng is scheduled to go to the counties of eastern Luanzhou next week to inspect the administration of officials. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng returned from Tianjin to Tangshan on the 17th and talked about the bandit gangs in each county of the Great Wall. He has ordered the special police and militia to jointly encircle and suppress them. He will go to each county for inspection within days and will go to Yuguan to urge Su Yuqi to take up the new position of Commissioner of the Ji-Mi District. The bandit disaster has been very serious in the areas near the Great Wall recently. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telephone call from Miyun said that more than 500 mounted bandits who had fled east from Shixia to Baihejiangou a few days ago were disturbing the local area. The First Brigade Headquarters of the Miyun Special Police dispatched troops to pursue them overnight on the 16th. However, the bandits scattered to other places to rob early in the morning of the 17th and fled back to outside the Qiangzilukou along the original road. Hundreds of mounted bandits in local uniforms and with complete guns and equipment appeared and disturbed the area, and then fled back outside the pass. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telephone call from Miyun said that in Jiagucun, Baimaguan, ninety miles north of Miyun, there is a resident named Peng Ziyun, who has recently recruited troops and gathered bandits, reaching more than 400 people. They are all wearing blue cloth military uniforms with yellow armbands with the words "Hua Hua Army, Team No. XX" written on them. Peng is now in command of them, contacting the bandit gangs in the Great Wall Pass and each pass, trying to intrude and disturb the area. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Yi Wo, Takahashi, and Others Go to Tianjin to Greet Tada</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The new commander of the Japanese Army in Tianjin, Tada Hayao, will arrive in Tianjin tomorrow morning. Both China and Japan are preparing to welcome him.

<p>(Tianjin) Yi Wo Cheng also came to the law on the 17th. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The head of the Shanhaiguan Special Service Agency, Takeshita, came to Tianjin from Beiping on the afternoon of the 18th. Matsui, Takahashi, and others are all waiting in Tianjin to greet Tada. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tada, the commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in North China, is scheduled to take the Beining Railway train from Yuguan at 7:30 AM on the 19th and arrive at Tanggu. He will change to a motorboat to come to the law. He will land at the Mitsui Wharf in the Japanese Concession at 9:30 AM and go to the Haiguang Temple Barracks along Miyajima Street on horseback. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Both the Yongding River and the North Canal Continue to Be Silted</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Yongding River has passed the flood season safely, and the water level has gradually receded in recent days, and the people along the river are greatly relieved. According to Xu Shida, director of the Engineering Department of the North China Water Conservancy Association, although the water flow of the Yongding River is gradually decreasing, the amount of sand it contains is very large. Recently, the water in the North Canal is also turbid. The total amount of silt in the two rivers is about 1% or more of the water volume, so the silting is still continuing. The success of silting the Haihe River this year is really unexpected. According to Tuohe, the water flow this year's flood season is quite rapid, resulting in damage to the weir gate of the irrigation project in Lingshou County. The North China Water Conservancy Association has set a budget to repair it after the flood season. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Han and Li Hold a Meeting to Block the Breach in Dongzhuang</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Han passed yesterday through the city of Wangtan, personally supervised the workers to throw hemp bags to rescue the danger. Today, after inspecting the dangerous works of Lihua, a meeting to block the breach will be held. Since the heavy rain on the 10th, the flow of the breach has completely changed. Only 20% of the main river water remains. Li Yishe told Han that the mission of this trip is to plan to make the water from Lianjiaba, the mouth of the lake, and Dongping Lake all be discharged through the main route, and to guide the water from Nanwang Lake to the north into Dongping Lake, and then return to the Yellow River through the canal. At present, the water from Dongping Lake entering the Yellow River has been realized, but Nanwang Lake is lower than Dongping Lake, and the water from the lake cannot flow north, so the plan cannot be realized. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The provincial government received a telegram from Ma Hongda, saying that the Yellow River in Ningxia has risen sharply and will arrive in Shandong within days. It has ordered the River Bureau and the counties to take strict precautions. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

After a few seconds, it descended straight down, with a light extending several feet. The tail was white, the head was fiery red, and the middle section was light green. As it lowered, the tail gradually expanded, followed by countless small spots of light (similar to small stars) descending like raindrops. As it plummeted, a faint rumbling sound was heard. It seemed to have landed not far from Beiping. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Italian Ambassador's Reply Telegram Arrives in Paris; Rejects Anglo-French Proposals; Strives to Avoid Agreement Based on League of Nations; No Clear Answers to British Inquiries; Representatives of Three Powers Continued Meeting Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Paris) The conversation between Laval and Aloisi this morning has made the atmosphere in Paris uneasy. The instructions from Rome received by the Italian representative this morning reportedly lack clarity on the following two key points: (1) Regarding the proposals that could serve as a basis for discussion, the telegram seems to dismiss them and instead puts forward practical measures to replace them. (2) Regarding the British representative Eden's desire to know exactly what Italy's demands are, the telegram does not mention it at all. When the French Prime Minister met with Eden, he informed Eden of the details of the exchange of views between Laval and Aloisi this morning. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to information obtained by a Havas news agency diplomatic correspondent, the Italian representative, Aloisi, stated during his meeting with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval this morning that the Italian government rejected the proposals put forward by Britain and France to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. However, the Italian side did not put forward a counter-proposal. There was also no definite answer to the questions asked by the British Minister Without Portfolio, Eden. It is said that Italy rejected the Anglo-French proposals in order to avoid an agreement based on the League of Nations. Italy's reasoning is that the concessions obtained by Britain, France, and Italy in Abyssinia as stipulated in the 1906 treaty are political in nature. Therefore, according to this treaty, Italy can of course demand political concessions from Abyssinia. The delegations of Britain, France, and Italy are now scheduled to meet at 3:30 this afternoon to discuss the final instructions from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Aloisi. Officials are quite pessimistic about the prospects of the negotiations. If Mussolini resolutely refuses to consider respect for the League of Nations covenant as a necessary condition for any proposal, it is impossible to know on what basis future negotiations will proceed. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Three-Power Conference has been postponed to await Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's response to the new proposals put forward by Britain and France yesterday to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The focus of the Abyssinian case has temporarily shifted from Paris to Rome. The eyes of the general public are now keenly focused on the Italian capital, as the peace or war in Africa depends entirely on Mussolini's response. The Italian representative, Aloisi, had a telephone conversation with the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs last night. Officials in Rome remained silent on the current situation. Mussolini is currently traveling by car, inspecting the Blackshirts conscripted in southern Italy for service in Africa. He happened to be out of the capital. It is said that the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is eager to contact him so that it can respond to the new Anglo-French proposals. However, public opinion in the Italian capital is far from optimistic. Many believe that the Paris conference will end with a statement. Then Geneva will encounter difficulties. If the League of Nations attempts to have a full discussion of the Abyssinian case, Italy may challenge Abyssinia and Great Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Britain and Italy Compete for Hegemony in the Mediterranean and Red Seas</p>
<p>(Paris) It is generally believed here today that the demand by Britain and France for Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to announce the minimum demands for Abyssinia has become the basis for negotiations at the Three-Power Conference. Mussolini's prolonged failure to reply further proves the importance of this matter. The attitudes of the representatives at yesterday's meeting already show the differences between Britain and Italy. The background is actually a struggle for hegemony in the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Paris deeply feels that Mussolini has ambitions to increase his control over the sea lanes of southern Europe, which is what keeps Britain restless. According to the most reliable sources today, Britain intends to make Italy understand that the Suez Canal is not as important to communicating Britain and India as Italy imagines. Even if Italy gains control of Abyssinia, it will not change suddenly, because Italy already has Eritrea and Somaliland on the coasts of the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. As for the Lake Tana region in Abyssinia, because the area is the center for irrigating the Nile River, Britain has made it clear that if Italy intends to seize the area, it will be a direct conflict with Britain. However, Britain also stated diplomatically that it does not expect such an accident to occur. Europe's most well-informed political commentator, Tapua, said today that Eden and Laval may soon go to Rome in person to ask Mussolini to accept economic rights in Abyssinia and abandon his ambitions for military control. (National News dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Three Countries Hold Separate Talks; Unable to Break the Deadlock</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval held talks with Italian representative Aloisi this morning at 10:00 AM, which lasted until 11:45 AM. At 11:55 AM, he held talks with British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, which lasted until 1:00 PM. After the talks, Laval told people that the negotiations were progressing with great difficulty. He also said that the next meeting of the Three-Power Conference of Britain, France, and Italy would be held at 3:30 PM. Also, the US Chargé d'Affaires in France, Marinier, visited the British Ambassador to France, Sir Clerk, this morning to inquire about the progress of the negotiations on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is generally believed that Italy considers the Italian-Abyssinian dispute to be a purely Italian colonial matter. Therefore, if the League of Nations Council meets on September 4 to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Italy will not attend the meeting. Italy is currently adopting a reserved attitude on this matter. People here are still optimistic about the Paris Three-Power Conference. The fact that the conference has not broken down after the opposing views of Britain and Italy were put forward shows that Britain's attitude has softened and is exploring various possible solutions that do not conflict with the 1906 Tripartite Agreement. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Anglo-French Proposals; Willing to Provide Financial Assistance to Italy for Development; Britain Opposes Political Concessions</h3>
<p>According to informed French sources, the content of the recent proposals submitted to Rome is that, as far as Britain and France are concerned, Abyssinia has been allowed to open up for Italy to engage in economic development. This proposal is based on the 1925 Anglo-Italian Agreement and this year's Franco-Italian Agreement. However, Britain retains rights to Lake Tana and the tributaries of the Nile. France only requests to protect its rights on the Djibouti to Addis Ababa railway.</p>
<p>In addition to the new proposals submitted to Rome, it is said that Britain and France are also willing to provide financial assistance to Italy for its economic development in Abyssinia, forming a tripartite financial development model. Although Eden has fully agreed to economic concessions to Italy, Britain still opposes political concessions. However, the French government expressed that, with the consent of the Abyssinian King, Italy could be granted certain guarantees, such as Abyssinian government departments hiring Italian advisors. It is said that the Abyssinian army is also included in this. France sees this as a guarantee of security for Italy. It is said that Eden will not agree to the proposals for financial assistance and Italian advisors until Mussolini's opinion on the new Anglo-French proposals has been received. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Laval and Eden are currently negotiating a joint Anglo-French plan. According to informed sources, this plan is not a fundamental solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but rather considers the possibility of how Italy can develop its economy in Abyssinia. Rumors are rife that Britain and France are willing to lend money to help Italy develop Abyssinian mineral resources. It is also said that if Mussolini can accept the Anglo-French economic proposals, Britain and France are willing to further discuss the issue of political guarantees. However, Italy has not yet revealed its intentions, so the conference has had to be temporarily suspended. (National News dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Italy Adopts Delaying Tactics; British and French Representatives Become Increasingly Impatient; Eden Prepares to Pack Up and Return Home</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Three-Power Conference is as precarious as a pile of eggs when Mussolini has not put forward written conditions. According to British sources in Paris last night, the British delegation's wait for a reply telegram from Rome cannot exceed two days. In the middle of next week, either this method or another method must be used to reveal the truth of the overall situation. It is not convenient to allow it to remain vague for so long. The general impression of the British and French communities in Paris last night was clearly pessimistic. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval is quite intolerant of the conference's setback, because his daughter is scheduled to marry on the 20th of this month, so he does not want the conference to suddenly become critical as this auspicious occasion approaches. The Paris Echo newspaper said that the situation in which Britain and Italy are testing each other's strength or are expressing their determination is becoming increasingly apparent. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that the British delegation has stated that if Italy has not responded to the political demands made to Abyssinia by the middle of next week, the British representatives plan to pack up and return home immediately. British Minister Without Portfolio Eden has put two very clear questions to Italy, namely: (1) the safety of Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, and (2) the safety of Italian immigrants who wish to live in Abyssinia. What minimum guarantees will Italy obtain? British sources do not believe that the threat of Abyssinia to Italian territories can become a reality. As for Italian sources, they insist that the 1906 treaty stipulates the relationship between Britain, France, Italy, and Abyssinia. This amendment has political significance and is tantamount to stipulating the division of Abyssinia. However, Italian sources are extremely secretive about what kind of political influence Italy will enjoy in Abyssinia and have made no indication whatsoever. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Italian Expert's Remarks Arouse French Surprise; Says Italy's Demands Were Declared Long Ago; French Newspapers' Tone Gradually Leans Toward Britain</h3>
<p>(Paris) Mr. Cagnassari, an expert from the Italian Embassy, received French journalists on behalf of Baron Aloisi. His remarks were quite surprising. French Prime Minister Laval said that the Three-Power Conference had stopped because Mr. Aloisi was quietly awaiting instructions from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. However, Mr. Cagnassari said that he did not expect any instructions and had never made such a request. Mr. Cagnassari answered the questions on the purely legal nature of the Three-Power Conference one by one. However, when it came to questions about Italy's demands, he suddenly said that they had already been published in Italian newspapers. Therefore, the press here generally believed that Mr. Cagnassari had probably received instructions from Rome, causing French newspapers to become increasingly impatient and gradually reveal a tone leaning toward Britain. For example, one newspaper said, "We also know that Mussolini's demands are justified, but in order to uphold the principles of the League of Nations, we have to support Britain." The Paris Evening News also said, "If Mussolini demands that Abyssinia become an Italian protectorate and there is no room for compromise, he should declare it as soon as possible. Mr. Mussolini may think that if he can delay the matter for three weeks, it will be beneficial to military preparations, but the bad impression that Britain and France will have is probably even worse."

<h3>British Propose; Convening a Naval Conference; US Has Not Yet Received Formal Notice; Britain and Japan to Conduct Preparatory Negotiations First</h3>
<p>(Washington) It has been rumored that Britain notified the United States, France, Japan, and Italy half a month ago, proposing to hold a naval conference in London in October.

<h3>Regular Summons by Japanese Army: Division Commanders' Conference; Stern Military Discipline to Be Emphasized with Important Instructions; Revision of Military Criminal Law Under Consideration</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) The military is considering revising the Army and Navy Criminal Law in January of next year. The Nagata Incident, in which a junior officer used a military sword to kill a senior officer, exposed a deficiency in the current military criminal law, which lacks a specific provision for such a crime. The existing law only includes Article 6 of the Army Criminal Law and Article 60 of the Navy Criminal Law, which stipulate the crime of assault by a superior officer. Therefore, in cases of murder, only the general murder clause of Article 199 of the ordinary criminal law can be applied. The punishment of the perpetrator, Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa, could not be determined solely based on the military criminal law and had to be dealt with under both the military and general criminal laws. This inadequacy is a critical defect in the military criminal law. Therefore, military leaders plan to wait until the Nagata Incident has concluded before, with the heads of the Army and Navy Legal Bureaus, Oyama and Yamanaka, as the central figures, discussing a fundamental revision of the military criminal law. There are also proposals to impose the death penalty for killing a superior officer in the same way as killing a direct ancestor, which is noteworthy. (Dentsu dispatch, 18th)</p>

During the congress, delegates from various countries did not present any new theories or inventions, but they had the opportunity to exchange research experiences and connect with the Soviet scientific community, which was considered a valuable event. One delegate participating in the congress stated, "The organization of the International Physiological Congress is like a scientific United Nations."

<p>(Moscow) The delegates to the 15th World Physiological Congress arrived here today by four special trains from Leningrad.

(TASS dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, hosted a banquet tonight in the Grand Kremlin for the delegates to the 15th International Physiological Congress. Over 1,500 people attended, including members of the Soviet government, delegates to the congress, Moscow scientists, and representatives from all sectors of Soviet society. Molotov delivered a speech, stating that the Soviet people paid close attention to and sympathized with the congress. Millions of Soviet citizens listened to the speeches of physiologists. "It is not difficult to understand this attitude of Soviet public opinion towards the work of the congress. Modern truly materialistic physiology has fulfilled the great task of liberating the human mind. It frees mankind from the decay of mysticism and religious prejudices, provides the possibility of truly organized and effective work in treating diseases, and is gradually occupying an important position in the development of industry and agriculture. The position of Soviet physiologists among scientists is becoming increasingly important. At the same time, we have produced world authorities in natural science, such as Pavlov (thunderous applause) and several other famous scientists. Therefore, we are proud that they have received great assistance from the Soviet government and the great hope of truly free scientific and creative work."</p>
<p>Molotov continued, "Soviet public opinion deeply understands the current situation and fate of science in the world, which is worrying. This is a feeling shared by scientists in capitalist countries, as expressed by the famous American scientist, Tallent, in his first report at the congress (thunderous applause). The position of science and the working conditions of scientists are far worse than before, and in many cases, they seem to be declining. The agents of obscurantism and aggressive nationalism have raised their heads high and are being assisted by the ruling parties. Although this situation can prove anything, it certainly cannot prove the so-called true interests of the people or represent cultural development and social progress by the ruling parties. No, what we see is that these policies are illusory and will eventually lead to their own destruction."</p>
<p>Amid thunderous applause, Molotov spoke of the position of science in the Soviet Union, saying, "We have forged a solid alliance between labor and science. The working masses have been freed from the control of parasitic millionaires. They see their bright future in the cultural development of all nations and in a prosperous world of Soviet science." Molotov added that the success of the Soviet planned economy has led to the increasing welfare of the working masses, and that the Soviet Union is uniting all nations to strive for a happy life, while promoting the cultural prosperity of all nations. This is a true example of harmonious cooperation among nations. Molotov mentioned the surge in cultural demand in the Soviet Union and the government's large-scale assistance to scientific and cultural work, stating that "we will triple the cost of school construction and double the cost of hospital construction next year compared to this year. In the current era, concern for science cannot be separated from concern for peace. The crisis of new imperialist wars is now particularly acute. Preparations for war and imperialist aggression have become obvious. The authorities in some countries are merely using the development of new imperialist wars to avoid their domestic difficulties, while the Soviet Union's appropriate peace policy (thunderous applause) and the Soviet government's resolute struggle to consolidate peace are in opposition to the above position. The Soviet Union has become a pillar of science and peace, and the Soviet Union's achievements meet the expectations of the masses and outstanding representatives of the scientific community in various countries."</p>
<p>Molotov then raised his glass to the health of the delegates to the congress, regarding it as one of the largest contingents of modern science. Everyone stood up, cheered Molotov, and applauded thunderously for a long time. (TASS dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Ping-Shen Train Robbery: Details of the Incident; Six Korean Passengers Arrested by Japanese Police in Ping</h3>
<p>The coffin of Wang Wenwei, the ticket inspector who died in the line of duty, has been transported to Beiping. According to a Beiping dispatch, the second Ping-Shen train traveling north, at 10:40 PM the night before, was robbed by bandits at Shahezi, a place a little over ten li from Shanhaiguan. Ticket inspector Wang Wenwei and railway police Xin Guangyu were shot and killed by the bandits. After the train arrived in Ping, six Korean passengers were taken away by the Japanese police. Details from various sources are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Truth of the Robbery</p>
<p>The second Ping-Shen train traveling north departed from Shenyang at 10:00 PM the night before and arrived at Yuguan Station, where it immediately switched to locomotive number 326. Due to the crowding of passengers, a third-class carriage, number 29, was attached behind the locomotive and in front of the luggage car. Other first, second, and third-class carriages were all attached behind the luggage car. The carriage was full, with seven or eight local travelers and two railway police officers as usual to maintain order, and the rest were Korean passengers. The train departed at 10:40 PM and traveled very fast. When it reached Shahezi, west of Shihe, Bai Zhensheng, a partner from the Xiaoying Company, was selling candy from a basket in the carriage. As soon as he stepped out of the carriage door, a burst of gunfire suddenly erupted. Passengers in other carriages, knowing that there was an emergency, became extremely panicked. The police officers escorting the train went out to maintain order, but the luggage car door was shaking and could not be opened, as it was locked from the outside. The gunfire continued. The captain of the escort team, Mr. Tang, heard the news. Because the train was traveling at full speed, he could not pass through to resist. He temporarily assigned guards to each carriage. The bandits in carriage number 29 brazenly robbed passengers of their belongings. When the bandits were looting, the passengers in carriage number 29 resisted, and the bandits opened fire indiscriminately. Ticket inspector Wang Wenwei, who was in the carriage checking tickets, heard the noise and tried to escape with his hat, but before he could exit the door, he was shot twice by the bandits. One bullet entered the back of his head and exited his left eye, and he died on the spot. Railway police officer Xin Guangyu, because the bandits tried to seize his gun, resisted and was also shot and killed. Passengers Han Shangyun and two others were also shot and killed. Other injured included railway police officer Dai Binghui and eight passengers, including Park Daeyuk.</p>
<p>Bandits Escape</p>
<p>As the train was about to enter Qinhuangdao Station, the bandits pulled the emergency brake in the third-class carriage to sound the alarm. The train slowed to a stop, and the bandits jumped out of the train, fired shots in the air as a show of force, and fled with their loot. After the train arrived at Qinhuangdao, Zhou Dechang and the train guard Zou Jinren led the railway police to inspect the carriage where the incident occurred. The entire carriage was covered in bloodstains, a truly tragic sight. Two firemen were also seriously injured, and the driver was missing. After arriving at Qinhuangdao, Zhou Dechang immediately telegraphed the Beining Railway Bureau to report the details of the robbery and had the bodies of the deceased moved from the train to the station for temporary storage. Carriage number 29 was also detached and inspected. The glass in the carriage was riddled with bullet holes. After the incident occurred, the Japanese army stationed in Yushu heard the report and sent a mobile unit by locomotive to search the Shihe area. The special police stationed in Qinhuangdao also mobilized to apprehend the bandits. However, the bandits had already fled far away and could not be caught. The train remained in Qinhuangdao for about two hours and then headed west. When it passed through Tangshan, the injured were sent to Tangshan Hospital for treatment. Upon receiving the news, the Beining Railway Bureau also ordered all stations to strictly inspect all passengers boarding the train to prevent bandits from mixing in.</p>
<p>Comforting Passengers</p>
<p>When the train passed through Tianjin, train conductor Zhou Dechang and train guard Zou Jinren got off the train to report the details of the robbery to the Beining Railway Bureau. A watchman named You, who was assigned to carriage number 29, accompanied the train to Langfang Station and was also summoned back to Tianjin by the Railway Bureau for questioning. The director of the bureau, Yin Tong, due to the unfortunate incident, sent a special telegram to Li Baozhen, the chief of the Beiping Qianmen Train Affairs Section, to represent him in comforting the passengers. Li immediately went to Yongdingmen Station, boarded the train, and, holding Yin's name card, offered condolences to the staff and passengers one by one. The Railway Bureau convened an emergency meeting yesterday and decided to send Deputy Director Xu Wenguo and Police Chief Chen Tao by special train from Tianjin at 10:10 AM to the scene of the incident to investigate everything.</p>
<p>Two Hour Delay</p>
<p>The train was originally scheduled to arrive at Beiping Qianmen East Station at 9:45 AM yesterday morning. Due to delays along the way, it was delayed by two hours, not arriving until 11:45 AM. Passengers disembarked at the first platform, where police from the Public Security Bureau's police security team and detective team separately inspected passengers' luggage and inquired about the details of the incident. The Japanese police station also sent military police to the station to assist in inspecting Korean passengers. The inspection was not completed until 12:30 PM. At that time, six Koreans were taken away by the Japanese police for questioning.</p>
<p>Aftermath of the Robbery</p>
<p>Xu Wenguo, the deputy director of the Beining Railway, went to investigate the truth by special train yesterday morning. He reported that night. Security between the authorities and Qinhuangdao is very tight, with checkpoints set up along the way to search for the escaped bandits. Four passengers who were injured and receiving treatment at the Meijin Hospital in Qinhuangdao arrived in Tianjin this morning, three came to Beiping, and the rest remained in the hospital. The bodies of Wang Wenwei, the ticket inspector who died in the line of duty, and railway police officer Guangyu, were coffined and enshrouded. Wang's coffin is scheduled to arrive in Beiping tonight. The Railway Bureau is currently deliberating on Wang's compensation. It is said that in addition to the compensation, his original salary will be paid monthly to support his orphaned children. Wang was from Tianjin, in his thirties this year, and served faithfully during his lifetime. (17th)</p>
<h3>Rampant Bandits Near Malanyu; Bandit Leader Zhang Huwu Plans to Capture the Eastern Tombs; 300 Mounted Bandits Discovered in Shixia Town; Yin Rugeng Summons Corps Commanders to Discuss Solutions</h3>
<p>According to a Beiping dispatch, relevant parties received a telephone report from Malanyu stating that the bandit situation near Malanyu is intensifying. In total, there are approximately 3,000 bandits with approximately 2,000 guns. The bandit leader is Zhang Huwu, who intends to capture Malanyu and the Eastern Tombs. Three hundred Japanese soldiers have already entered Malanguan to suppress the bandits. Our special police have also been on strict alert to prevent them from fleeing randomly.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, over 300 mounted bandits were discovered east of Shixia Town. Because the police and local militias were very vigilant, at 6:00 AM this morning, they fled to Baihejian Gou (south of Xiaoxinkailing), a little over ten li north of Shixia. Special police are currently stationed on various mountain tops to block their escape. Due to the rampant bandits, the First Brigade Headquarters of the special police stationed in Miyun, at 1:00 AM this morning, transferred two additional companies of special police from Shunyi. One team is defending Miyun County, and the other team was transported overnight to Shixia Town by the seized Dachang Yongfeng long-distance buses to reinforce defenses. Also, over a hundred bandits were discovered at Niufengyuko, a little over twenty li northwest of Miyun, a few days ago. Farmers are flocking to the county seat to avoid the chaos. County Magistrate Wang Bolin has ordered the local defense corps to cooperate with the special police to actively block them.</p>
<p>Previously, it was reported that special police would be increased in the war zone to suppress bandits. After special commissioner Yin Rugeng of the Aoyu District contacted the relevant parties, there were still no results. Yin summoned the first and second corps commanders of the special police, Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, to Tianjin on the 14th and 15th to discuss bandit suppression measures. It is said that concrete measures have already been decided. The two Zhangs have returned to their respective defenses. Yin is also scheduled to return to the Tangshan Commissioner's Office today.

<h3>Wei Lihuang Supervises the Suppression of Remnant Bandits on the Zhejiang Border - Organizing a Joint Clearing and Suppression Command for the Four Provinces Border Area</h3>
<p>The Military Affairs Commission in Hangzhou has specially appointed Wei Lihuang as the commander-in-chief of the clearing and suppression in the border area of the four provinces of Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi in order to eliminate the remnant bandits in this area. All commanders of the various units in the four provinces border area are under Wei's command and control. After receiving the order, Wei arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 16th. Over ten people, including his accompanying adjutants and guards, took the night train to Hangzhou that evening. Wei, accompanied by his secretary and others, took two cars and arrived in Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway at 7:00 PM on the 17th. After resting at the West Lake Hotel for about half an hour, at 7:40 PM, he took a car to the Jianggan First Pier to cross the river, then transferred to a special train on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to Jiangshan to inspect the front lines and meet with Xuan Tiewu, the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, to discuss bandit suppression plans. The headquarters for the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the four provinces border area has already dispatched personnel to begin organizing, and all personnel will be transferred from the existing reserve army headquarters to save expenses. The headquarters location has been selected in Quzhou. It is said that it will be officially established on September 1st. As for the bandit forces in southern Zhejiang, since they were pursued by the Nationalist army in multiple directions, the territory within Quzhou has been completely cleared. The bandits, under pressure, are fleeing towards the border between Jin and Chu, with the potential to continue fleeing to Songyang, Xuanping, and Yunhe. Currently, there are three groups of bandits fleeing along the Jin-Chu border. One group of remnant bandits disturbing Nenkeng fled east on the 14th to the south of Yingtou Village, near Kengjian. The Huang Fuwu group, which fled into Xinzhai area in the south of Wuyi, due to pressure from government troops, turned southeast and arrived at the Xiaofeishi area. In addition, remnant bandits who fled into the northwest of Xiaoshun Station in southern Yunhe fled northeast near Xiaogang. The Nationalist army is pursuing them in multiple directions, hoping to annihilate them in one fell swoop. (18th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Offer Through Transport, Scheduled to Begin in Mid-September; Journey from Guangdong to Hankou to Take Four Days</h3>
<p>According to a Guangzhou dispatch, the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has been actively carrying out track-laying work, aiming to complete the direct through-train service between the northern and southern sections by the end of the 25th year. It has been verified that the section of track from Pingshi on the Guangdong border to Luojiaping was completed at the end of last month and was test-run once, which was stable along the way. The locomotives have already been equipped. The section started operation on the 15th of this month to transport passengers and goods. Currently, track-laying work is being carried out to extend to Pingkou on one side and to build Hengzhou Station in the Xiang section in Hengzhou. It has been verified that the section from Lechang in Guangdong to Luojiaping involved considerable engineering. The railway track runs along the mountains and faces the river, with the route passing through five mountain tunnels, all of which have now been completed. It can now offer through transport with highway vehicles in Hunan Province. In the future, for the section from Pingkou to Zhuzhou, there are still 406 kilometers of unfinished railway. Currently, the Guangdong and Hunan authorities, for the sake of facilitating transportation, have discussed and agreed on measures for combined railway and highway transport, which will be implemented in mid-September of this year. In the future, before the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is connected, a temporary transport route will be available. It is estimated that the journey from Guangdong to Hankou will take four days, which is half to two-thirds less time than taking the Yushui waterway from Guangdong to Hankou. The combined highway and railway transport will start from Huangsha Station on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway in Guangzhou, passing through the following connecting stations: Yin Xiao Ao Station, Lianjiangkou Station, Yingde Station, Shaozhou Station, Lechang Station, Pingshi Station, Xiaotang Station, Yizhang Station, Chenzhou Station, Laiyang Station, Hengzhou Station, Nanyue Station, Xiangtan East Station, Yijiawan Station, Changsha East Station, Miluo Station, Yuezhou Station, Tongxiangmen Station, Xujiapeng Station, and Hankou Station. Departing from Guangzhou, taking the Guangdong-Hankou southern section train to Pingshi Station takes approximately eleven hours, with a third-class ticket costing approximately $4.70. Taking a highway bus from Pingshi to Xiaotang Station takes approximately half an hour, with a fare of $0.48. Taking a Hunan southern highway bus from Xiaotang to Hengzhou takes seven hours, with a fare of $6.65. Taking a highway bus from Hengzhou to Changsha takes approximately five and a half hours, with a fare of approximately $5.40. Taking the Guangdong-Hankou northern section train from Changsha to Xujiapeng (i.e., across the river from Hankou) takes approximately fourteen hours, with a third-class ticket costing $5.70. In total, it takes the first day from Guangzhou to Lechang, the second day to Hengzhou, the third day to Changsha, and the fourth day to Hankou, staying overnight in each location. The total combined transport fare for the entire journey is $22.94, with the total time spent on highway and railway transport being 38 hours. (August 17th)</p>
<h3>Eight More Prisoners Escape from Xiamen; They Chiseled Through Walls and Residents Even Watched; Police Arrived and Opened Fire, and the Remaining Prisoners Did Not Manage to Escape Completely</h3>
<p>According to a Xiamen dispatch, last month, ten prisoners escaped from the Xiamen Court Prison by digging a tunnel. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 PM on the 14th, eight more prisoners escaped by chiseling through walls. It has been verified that the escaped prisoners were: (1) Chen Zhushui from Zhao'an, a murderer sentenced to ten years of imprisonment; (2) Chen Zhencheng from Siming, a robber whose sentence has not been determined; (3) Tang Rongfeng from Zhao'an, a robber who has been sentenced; (4) Su Jianqiu from Zhejiang, a kidnapper sentenced to seven years; (5) Hu Jianghe from Haicheng, a murderer sentenced to twenty years; (6) Chen Songbai from Tongan, a bandit sentenced to thirteen years; (7) Weng Lintian from Anhui, a thief sentenced to five years; (8) Li Feng from Siming, a murderer whose sentence has not been determined. After the incident, it was learned that the masterminds were Su Jianqiu, Li Feng, Chen Zhencheng, Hu Jianghe, and Chen Songbai. Su and others began their escape work from around 2:00 PM on the 14th. First, they used lead wires to hang on the southwest walls of cell number seven, and covered the lead wires with a quilt to block people's view. Chen, Hu, Li, and Chen hid behind the quilt and poured boiling water on the south wall first, then used the sharp end of a bed board to chisel. Su kept watch at the prison cell door. The wall was made of earth and stone. Before long, a rectangular hole about two chi high and three chi wide was opened, and a large stone three chi long and one chi high and earth and sand on three sides were excavated. At around 11:00 PM at night, eight prisoners escaped from Bao and headed towards Sharou Lane. Weng Lintian was the last to escape. Nearby small shops had not yet closed, and many people came out to watch. Liu Chunfu, the post police in the area, saw the situation and chased after them. One prisoner struck the police fiercely with a sharp piece of wood. The police then fired a shot into the air, so the other seventeen prisoners in the same cell, including Chen Wenhui, did not dare to continue escaping after hearing the sound. When the team police arrived, they immediately blocked the hole. That night, Zhang Weiying, the on-duty prison guard in charge of internal affairs, and Li Yongbo, in charge of external affairs, and Director Zhang Fucai also went out to pursue the prisoners after hearing the gunfire. However, the eight prisoners had already escaped without a trace. Xu Wuqian, the guard, immediately reported to the local court. Soon, inspector Xu Shaoxue led over ten clerks and judicial police to the prison for inspection, questioned the seventeen prisoners who had not escaped one by one, and obtained details of the escape. Before long, Xu Jiashi, the president of the high court, also arrived. Xu Wuqian, the warden, was allowed to post bail pending investigation. The three on-duty guards were detained, and the Public Security Bureau was notified by telegram to order its subordinates to assist in the arrest. It has been verified that the Xiamen Prison has changed wardens three times this year. Last month, ten prisoners escaped by digging a tunnel without a single one being captured. This time, if the post police had not discovered the escape and fired a shot, all twenty-five prisoners in cell number seven would have escaped. Moreover, it was 11:00 PM at night, and residents had not yet gone to sleep and were still watching, which shows the boldness of the escaped prisoners and the negligence of the prevention.

<h3>The Economic Commission is Building Tea Improvement Farms in Huizhou and Qimen</h3>
<p>Specializing in Research on Planting, Improving and Manufacturing Wuhu Communication, Anhui Huiguang counties are famous tea producing areas. In the past, the amount of tea transported and sold overseas was huge, especially Qimen black tea, which was the most famous. However, because they silently adhered to the old methods and did not know how to improve, the overseas market was seized by Japan, Ceylon and Java. However, the color, quality and taste of Qicha are unique, and they are all better than other countries. If it can be actively improved, it is still possible to recover the overseas market. Therefore, the government attaches great importance to the improvement of black tea. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has announced the exemption of Qicha tax rate, which is intended to reduce the burden and give special encouragement. The National Economic Commission, in accordance with the government's intention, specially planned to build a tea improvement farm on Phoenix Mountain outside the South Gate of Qimen County to specialize in researching planting improvement and manufacturing. Director Zhao of the Agriculture Department was specially sent, together with Qian Suozhang of the Central Agricultural Experiment Farm of the Ministry of Industry, to Qimen to inspect the farm site. Now it has been completed, and on the 16th, they returned to Beijing by car via Wuhu. According to reports, it has been determined to build a tea improvement farm on Phoenix Mountain in Qimen, because the location is just right and it is easy to control the implementation of the plan to improve the entire area. Hu Changchang, the head of the improvement farm, has conducted surveys with technicians, which can be completed in about three days. Construction can begin this month, and it is planned to simultaneously build a 50-li motor road to connect with the Pingli Tea Improvement Farm on the South Road and integrate it into the industrial zone. The funds will be allocated entirely by the National Economic Commission. (August 17th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: A Modern Female Corpse Found in Xiangqitu</h3>
<p>An unidentified female corpse was found in Guan Tanghe, north of the Hushan Shiqiao in Xiangqitu, Yongfeng Town, within the city. She was standing upright in the river, about twenty years old, with short hair, wearing a Xiangyun silk shirt, short-sleeved and narrow, dressed in a modern style. Yin Mugen, the town police officer, reported it to the local court's prosecutor's office for inspection.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Capture Thieves and Recover Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau's Detective Team previously apprehended two thieves, Liao Shangwen and Zhang Wenyou, at Zhangzegang Port. After learning the whereabouts of their accomplices based on the confessions of the two suspects, Captain Yang apprehended three thieves, Wu Decai, Wu Qian Shi, and Wu Raoyao Zi, at their residences in Pudong. They have now been brought back for questioning. They confessed that there was a boat and stolen goods hidden in the home of a certain family in Baihegang, Qingpu. Captain Yang led detectives Wei Yunhui and Sun Shaoqing to Qingpu and, together with Jin Duchazhang of the Qingpu Public Security Bureau, went to Baihegang and confiscated a trunk containing loan receipts, pawn tickets, clothes, and fabrics. The remaining accomplices are being investigated and will be prosecuted together.</p>
<h3>Water Conservancy Bureau Sends Personnel to Survey the Seawall</h3>
<p>The dangerous condition of the seawall in this county has attracted considerable attention from the provincial government. Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office sent deputy engineer Tu Yaobin, who arrived in Songjiang yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. This morning, he was accompanied by Gu Shuchen, a technician from the county government's technical section, to Jinshanwei to inspect the seawall in order to prepare for the construction.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Steamship Companies Reduce Fares</h3>
<p>After the opening of the Xihu Highway, steamship companies feared they would fail. The Suzhou-Changzhou shipping companies once proposed joint operations, but were unexpectedly opposed by the Laogongmao Bureau. However, now that cars have officially started running, steamship passengers will be affected. Therefore, the fares of the Kunshan Qingyang Port ferries have been reduced by one corner for each class, and the fares of the Xiban ferries have been reduced by 40%, effective from the 16th. As for the Suzhou-Changzhou Steamship Bureau, it still needs to convene a meeting to decide. It is likely that the fares will be changed to three types: two corners, three corners, and four corners. This will also be realized soon. At the same time, the Provincial Shipping Association also has this proposal and will convene a meeting of members from all counties in the province to resolve it.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Township Chief Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Huang Heshang, who previously worked as a laborer in Shanghai, returned to his hometown in Hongqiao Township, outside the East Gate, and was suddenly harmed and killed by local thugs, who threw his body into the river. After the discovery, it was reported to the county government. Now the county has sent a presiding officer to go to the countryside on the 19th of this month to open the coffin for inspection. However, Shao Heyun, the local township chief, witnessed Huang's murder and advised the murderers not to do it, but he did not report the situation afterwards. Now that the incident has occurred, he feared being implicated. Therefore, he hanged himself to death on the morning of the 17th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Appealing for Exemption from Increased Flour Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>The Consolidated Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance levies a consolidated tax of 6.5 cents per bag of flour. Recently, the Ministry of Finance, in order to increase tax revenue, ordered the General Tax Department to instruct consolidated tax collection offices in various places to increase the consolidated tax on flour by 5 cents per bag from August 1st. The Jiufeng, Maoxin, Tailong, and other flour mills in Wuxi City believe that the import of foreign wheat has been increasing in recent years, and flour sales have been sluggish, making it very difficult to maintain operations. If the consolidated tax is increased again, it would be equivalent to driving various flour mills to bankruptcy. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the original tax rate of 6.5 cents be maintained and that the increase be exempted. Before the Yuan and Ministry approve the petition, the consolidated tax payable by each flour mill will be temporarily recorded.</p>
<h3>Suzhou-Wuxi Road Divided into Two Sections for Construction</h3>
<p>Following orders to build the Suzhou-Wuxi Road in this county, the survey has long been completed. The original budget was 180,000 yuan, but the Construction Department has reduced it to 85,000 yuan. The plan is to first build a dirt road for traffic, and the bridges will be made of wood. The road surface width is set at 7.5 meters, and the average filling height is 8 meters, requiring 153,000 cubic meters of filling. The Construction Bureau, through the relationship of Huang Zhiying, decided to divide the entire project into two sections for implementation. The first section requires 5,947.77 cubic meters of earthwork, and the second section requires 137,682.13 cubic meters. There are 25 large and small bridges along the route, with 137 full arches. There are five agricultural field water pipes per kilometer, totaling 130. The plan and budget were submitted to the government for approval yesterday.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: President of the Judicial Yuan is Visiting Changzhou</h3>
<p>Ju Zheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, took time out of his schedule in Nanjing yesterday (the 17th) morning to take a fast train to Changzhou at around 11:00 AM for sightseeing. Those who came with him included two secretaries, Liu and Zhang, and his son. After getting off the train, because he and Xie Zhijing, a lawyer in the city, were old friends, Xie accompanied him to Tianning Temple, Qingliang Temple, the First Park, and other places for sightseeing. In the meantime, he took a car to Wuxi.</p>
<h3>Provincial Committee Investigates Private Enclosure of Lake Land</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government has recently formulated measures to stop the private enclosure of lake land for cultivation and has ordered the counties along the lake to conduct thorough investigations and report any discoveries in a timely manner, ordering the demolition of any such enclosures. The Provincial Government dispatched inspector Gu Qiaoruo to various counties to urge implementation. Since there are many private enclosures of lake land in Wujiang and Wuxian, Committee Member Gu went to sit and supervise the demolition, which has lasted for more than a month. Yesterday (the 17th), he came to Changzhou from Suzhou and plans to conduct on-site inspections in the lakeside areas before going to Yixing and Wuxi to investigate.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Old Store Clerk Suddenly Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>Shen Zengyou (from Ningbo), a clerk at the Longshun Dry Tobacco Store on Hexi Street in the county seat, was 67 years old. He was kind and diligent in his work and was trusted by the store owner. However, Shen had no parents or children and was all alone, making him pitifully lonely. He often felt sadness about his life. Last December, he attempted to hang himself in secret but was rescued. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 16th), Shen hanged himself again in the toilet. People discovered it soon after and rushed to save him, but he had already been dead for a long time and could not be resuscitated. The store owner, Ben Yougen, reported it to the county government. Chen, the county magistrate, personally inspected the body in the afternoon and confirmed that he had died by hanging. He ordered the Ningbo Guildhall to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Held Memorial Service Yesterday for Four Fallen Police Officers; Director Cai Attended and Presided over the Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau recently had four police officers who died in the line of duty. Director Cai Jinjun, to commemorate the four officers and encourage their descendants, specially held a memorial service at 8:00 AM yesterday in the auditorium of the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road. Director Cai personally presided over the ceremony, and representatives from all police officers in the city were sent to attend and pay their respects. For a time, on Wenmiao Road, police officers in white uniforms participating in the memorial service came and went in an endless stream, creating a solemn and tragic atmosphere. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Altar</p>
<p>From 8:00 AM yesterday, additional police officers were dispatched at the intersection of Zhonghua Road to maintain order. A plain archway was erected high at the entrance of the Wenmiao People's Education Center, with a white cloth banner hanging on it that read, "Memorial Service for the Four Fallen Police Officers of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau." Inside, there were two more colorfully decorated archways in front of and behind the auditorium. Further inside, the arrangement of the altar was extremely orderly and solemn. In the center hung the portraits of the four martyrs: Zhu Jishan, Qian Guilin, Mu Shunan, and Liu Shoujing. Nine pots of fresh flowers and five tripods were displayed on the altar table, along with a pair of tall, plain candles. Outside, there was a piece of embroidered curtain. In front of this were floral wreaths from Director Cai, Secretary Su Liping, Section Chief Chen Guangzong, all officers and police of the Public Security Bureau, all officers and police of the First Squadron, companies, businesses, residents from various streets, and memorial scrolls from various public security sub-bureaus and police stations in the city. Among them, a couplet personally presented by Director Cai was the most striking, reading: "Officer Zhu Jishan, due to directing traffic, and Officers Qian Guilin, Mu Shunan, and Liu Shoujing, due to apprehending bandits, successively encountered mishaps; their demise has become a lesson for those who came before; their loyalty in sacrificing their lives has left a model for those who come after."</p>

<p>Holding of the Public Memorial Service</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, the public memorial service began. First, the family members of the four police officers offered incense and flowers, took their seats, and completed the family memorial ceremony. Then, Director Cai led all officers and police of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in the ceremony according to the prescribed order. The ceremony was conducted by Zhou Zhicheng as the master of ceremonies. After everyone stood in solemn silence, the presiding officer, Director Cai, took his place. Immediately, the police orchestra of the Public Security Bureau played mournful music and performed the sacrificial rites, bowing three times. The presiding officer offered flowers, and after a moment of silent tribute, Yu Pu, the director of education at the Police Training Institute, read the eulogy (attached below). After the reading, mournful music was played, and the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Memorial Eulogy</p>
<p>The eulogy personally written by Director Cai read: "On this eighteenth day of August, in the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, Cai Jinjun, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, leading all staff, respectfully offers this pure wine and fragrant flowers to the spirits of Zhu Jishan, Mu Shunan, Liu Shoujing, and Qian Guilin, saying: Alas, you four, diligent and loyal, facing danger and responding to changes, never shirking your responsibilities. When standing at the crossroads, a vehicle suddenly darted across; directing without effect, you encountered calamity. While inspecting, you served diligently and cautiously; a sudden mutiny occurred, and you sacrificed your lives. Furthermore, when facing danger, searching for the bandit leader, on water and on land, you relentlessly pursued the fleeing enemy; not anticipating that a cornered beast could still fight back, its poisonous stinger caused your untimely demise. With such courage, you confronted the vicious and cruel; the flying pellet hit the magpie, injuring and killing a man. Facing danger, never compromising; upon encountering incident after incident, your spirit embodied great fearlessness; you did not avoid the tiger's den or the dragon's pool. Your loyalty in planning affairs, your courage in executing tasks, the citizens admire you, the authorities commend and cherish you. Though your bodies are gone, your spirits remain; deterring corruption and establishing morality. Sincere in your actions, you touched the hearts of men; worthy of song and tears. Therefore, we hold this memorial service to comfort your heroic souls. May your spirits be not unaware, and come to accept our offerings. Alas, still resounding."</p>

<h3>Temporary Postponement of Land Acquisition at Qianliang Temple; Official Letter from Songjiang County Government to Shanghai Telegraph Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau recently planned to acquire 200 mu of land in Changqiao Town, Songjiang County, to build a radio station. The more than 200 landowners in the area are all self-cultivating farmers. If their land is acquired, they will lose their livelihoods, and more than 2,000 people will be displaced. Therefore, they have repeatedly petitioned the provincial government, the Executive Yuan, and the county government, stating their grievances and strongly opposing the acquisition, requesting that the decision be reversed. The county government, understanding the real situation, felt sympathy for them and, based on the instructions of the provincial government regarding the petition of Zhu Hexiang and others, specially sent a commissioner to retrieve the land acquisition notice issued the other day from the Telegraph Bureau in order to discuss alternative solutions. The official letter from the Songjiang County Government to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Regarding your bureau's plan to acquire land near Qianliang Temple in the 51st district, 36th Bao of Xinzhuang District (i.e., Changqiao Town) of this county to build a radio transmitting station, your bureau previously submitted a clear list of the names of the landowners and the number of mu to be acquired, requesting that it be publicly announced in accordance with the law. This was done in a draft notice on the 9th of this month, requesting your bureau to publish it in the Zhonghua, Minbao, and Xinwen newspapers so that the public would be aware.</p>
<p>However, a petition from citizens Zhu Heqing and others states that the case has been submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government on August 12, Jianzi No. 229, which states, 'The submission has been noted. Since the citizens have repeatedly petitioned, temporarily wait for consultation with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Communications for review and handling. You are hereby notified.' They requested that the process be temporarily suspended. This petition has been received by the county government.</p>
<p>Since this case has already been submitted by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Communications for review and handling, and based on the request from Zhu Heqing and others for a temporary suspension, the county government should temporarily postpone the public announcement to await further instructions and to appease the people. Special commissioner Gu Guangyi from the Second Section of this government is being sent to your bureau to explain the details in person. Please return the previously submitted draft announcement to Mr. Gu so that it can be handled after the ministries and the province have resolved the matter. This letter is sent to the Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Bao, for your information and action." Issued on August 16.</p>
<p>Also, the document from Zhu Heqing and others to the county government says: "Regarding the case of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau forcibly acquiring land regardless of the people's livelihood, petitioning for a change of location and alternative solutions, requesting that the county government not assist in the oppression by issuing a public announcement, for the sake of the lives of all people: The petitioners hereby submit that the Shanghai Radio Telegraph Bureau, under false pretenses, forcibly acquires civilian land, harming the people's livelihood, and petition for a change of location and alternative solutions. We now receive Jiangsu Provincial Government's Jianzi No. 229 issued on August 12, which states, 'The submission has been noted. Since the citizens have repeatedly petitioned, temporarily wait for consultation with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Communications for review and handling. You are hereby notified.' This demonstrates that our provincial government truly cares about the people's livelihood and strives to maintain the overall situation. All the people in the township burn incense and pray, hoping for rebirth. Therefore, we specially submit the original instructions for your review. Please, with the provincial government's love for the people, do not be misled by the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, uphold justice, and stop the process to avoid complications. The locality would be fortunate, and the people would be fortunate. Respectfully submitted to the Songjiang County Government." From this, it can be seen that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's large-scale land acquisition is still difficult to realize.</p>

<h3>Simplified Life Insurance by the Post Office Scheduled to Launch Next Month; Convenient for Common People with Especially Low Premiums, Minimum 50 Yuan; Simplified Procedures Similar to Savings Account</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications' Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has established simplified life insurance. The regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. The bureau has been actively preparing for a long time, but because the insured amounts are small and the premiums must be paid monthly, the preparation procedures are quite troublesome. They are now largely ready and are scheduled to launch in September. This simplified insurance is originally intended to benefit the common people, so the insured amounts are different from ordinary insurance companies. The minimum is 50 yuan, and the maximum is 500 yuan. The premiums are paid monthly, and some are as low as one dime of silver per month, so it is easy to afford, and anyone can apply for insurance. The purpose of launching this simplified life insurance is to cultivate the people's savings habits. The procedures are simplified as much as possible, and are very similar to opening a regular savings account. For the pilot program, the bureau plans to first launch it in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou. If the results are good, it will be extended to other areas for widespread adoption.</p>
<h3>Early Rice Has Slightly Appeared; Rice Prices Correspond to Supply and Demand; Wheat Expensive, Flour Cheap, Flour Mills Losing Money; Half of Cotton Mills Have Stopped Production</h3>
<p>The autumn harvest is approaching. New grain has slightly appeared in Nanjing, Guangbo, Pudong, Xiashi, and other places. Pudong saw new grain in half a month, and Ningbo and Nanjing began shipping batches of new grain to Shanghai in early last week. From now on, supply and demand will correspond, and the green and yellow will connect, so rice prices can be gradually balanced. According to observations by rice industry insiders, this year's grain and rice harvest is expected to be more abundant than in previous years. Although there was a drought in early summer, rainfall was sufficient afterward. In the past half month, the late rice fertilization period has arrived, and in the areas with crisscrossing rivers in Jiangnan, there is no need to bail water. In the future, the ear-filling period can steadily improve. Furthermore, some of the imported rice ordered this spring has not yet been sold out, so it is expected that rice prices will decline in the future. However, the decline in rice prices after the autumn harvest will be detrimental to farmers' incomes.</p>
<p>Wheat Expensive, Flour Cheap, Flour Mills in Trouble</p>
<p>When new wheat appeared in early summer this year, flour mills were optimistic. At that time, various provinces in China urgently needed flour to supplement the shortage of rice, so it was expected that flour mills could steadily get through the peak season this summer. However, in the past two weeks, domestic and foreign wheat prices have been rising indefinitely, and flour prices have gradually declined due to the stability of the rice market (now flour is only about 2.4 yuan), causing difficulties for various flour mills. It is said that if this continues, they will discuss reducing or individually stopping production by the end of this month.</p>
<p>More Than Half of Cotton Spinning Mills Have Stopped or Reduced Production</p>
<p>As for domestic cotton mills, after the deepening of expensive cotton and cheap yarn, the number of mills that have stopped or reduced production in Shanghai has reached 30%. Although yarn and cotton prices have repeatedly risen in the past month, the phenomenon of expensive cotton and cheap yarn has not improved, and current sales are also limited. Therefore, the number of mills that have stopped or reduced production has recently reached 50%. According to a leader of a certain cotton mill, it will not be easy to resume production until the new cotton appears on the market and the situation is assessed. It is also learned that the Chinese cotton mill industry has requested that the Japanese cotton mills in Shanghai reduce their operating hours as a gesture of friendship to avoid excessive competition. However, because most of the Japanese cotton mills are engaged in both spinning and weaving, the issue is still under consideration, and there is no formal response indicating whether permission will be granted.</p>
<h3>New Life Service Corps Departed Yesterday to Promote Sanitation; Sincerely Provided Instructions and Guidance with a Cordial Attitude</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association's Youth Service Corps departed again yesterday morning at 8:00 AM to inspect hygiene in hotels and barbershops in various districts as usual. In Xiaodongmen, Laoximen, and the Baoshan Road area of Zhabei, they worked diligently to provide guidance, their spirits were particularly vibrant, and their attitudes were very cordial. They inspected whether the equipment in hotels and barbershops was clean or not. If it was not up to standard, they sincerely provided instructions. The inspection results were filled in a progress chart. They dispersed at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Wife Agreed to Assist in Fundraising for Flood Relief in Various Provinces; Appointed Deputy Director of the Women's Guidance Group;</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, it has been actively working and is extremely busy. In order to increase the fundraising efforts, the committee has specially established a Women's Fundraising Group, publicly recommending the wife of President Kong as the director and the wife of Mayor Wu as the deputy director. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The latest news is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Wife Assumes Position in Women's Group</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's wife officially replied to the committee yesterday, expressing her acceptance of the position of Deputy Director of the Women's Fundraising Group. Mayor Wu's wife's enthusiasm for charitable work is commendable. It is hoped that the ladies of all circles in Shanghai will emulate her and extend their compassion to help those in distress, participating and supporting the effort together to raise a large sum of money as soon as possible to rescue those who are left behind. Mayor Wu's wife's original letter to the committee is attached below:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, I have received your letter and read it with great concern. Your committee, in view of the terrible floods in various provinces, is launching a fundraising campaign for relief with a feeling of compassion. I have been asked to serve as the Deputy Director of the Women's Fundraising Group. This is a duty that I should fulfill, and I will follow the example of the wise and virtuous and participate in this noble cause. I am hereby informing you of this and hope you will take note. Sincerely, Wu Ma Fengqi."</p>
<p>This Newspaper Received Donations Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th), this newspaper received donations for flood relief in various provinces, totaling 37 yuan: Mr. Ma Jun, 10 yuan; Mr. Wang Xingmin, 10 yuan; Gu Deji, 5 yuan; Gu Shanji, 5 yuan; Ms. Xu Juxiang, 5 yuan; Mr. Gu Junqi, 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Da Zhongguo Pharmaceutical Factory Donates Sha Medicine</p>
<p>Da Zhongguo Daode Pharmaceutical Factory has always had the heart of providing widespread relief and has always been happy to contribute to public welfare and charitable causes. The factory's newly manufactured popular emergency Sha medicine water is made with especially fine ingredients and has even greater efficacy, which is very different from ordinary Sha medicine water. Yesterday, Xu Xiajun, executive director of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, obtained 2,000 bottles of this medicine water from the factory to be shipped to the disaster areas in Luxi and Jining to provide relief. The original letter from Mr. Xu is also recorded below:</p>
<p>"Dear Sirs, I have donated 2,000 bottles of popular emergency Sha medicine water from Da Zhongguo Daode Pharmaceutical Factory. The Sha medicine water manufactured by this factory uses authentic medicinal materials and does not use alcohol to treat emergency Sha. It is incredibly effective and completely different from the Sha medicine water sold in the market. Therefore, I specially donate this and send this letter as a gift. I hope that it will be transported to the disaster areas to provide relief and that Da Zhongguo Daode Pharmaceutical Factory, the donor, will be rewarded or thanked as usual.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Bocang Donates Writing Fees to Help with Disaster Relief</p>
<p>This year, the provinces in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have suffered extremely heavy flooding, and the disaster victims have been displaced, without food or clothing. Following this, in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the Yellow River's water has breached the dikes in many places, causing disasters. The number of suffering people is even greater than in the year of Xinwei. Mr. Ye Bocang, a resident of this city, concerned about disaster relief, generously donated his writing fees of more than 130 yuan, sending it to the Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces for verification, collection, and transfer to the disaster areas for distribution to enhance relief efforts.</p>

<h3>Pessimism Envelops the Whole City; Imports of Consumable Goods Decline; Decline in Cigarettes is the Most Significant; Decline in Women's Cosmetics is Also Notable</h3>
<p>Shanghai has always been known for its prosperity, and the daily lives of its citizens are accustomed to extravagance. For all kinds of consumable goods, taking foreign goods as a source of pride is common. Therefore, the import of foreign luxury goods is a large consumption area for Shanghai. However, since this year, pessimism has enveloped the whole city, and the purchasing power of citizens has gradually weakened. The import of foreign goods has gradually declined. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency interviewed Mr. Wu Daozhen, a specialist from the Statistics Division of the International Trade Bureau, to inquire about the ebb and flow of imported foreign consumable goods in the first half of this year. The information provided was quite detailed.</p>
<p>Imports of Foreign Wine Not Reduced</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wu, the Shanghai market is in a slump, and various industries are depleted. Merchants dealing in foreign goods are also unable to profit. In the first half of the year, the import of foreign goods gradually declined. However, the reduction in daily life consumable goods and luxury goods pouring into Shanghai was still small. Taking tobacco and alcohol as an example, the import to Shanghai in the first half of the year was nearly 3 million gold units. Compared with last year, the imports of foreign wine were not reduced, and the imports in the first half of the year also reached 590,000 gold units, of which beer was the largest and whiskey was the second largest, which shows the preferences of people in Shanghai. The import of cigarettes, tobacco sheets, and other items in the first half of the year was greatly reduced, accounting for only 31% of the same period last year. More than 90% of them are sold in Shanghai. The reason for the decline in tobacco imports this year may be due to the promotion of the New Life Movement and the ban on smoking cigarettes. However, the general weakening of consumption power is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Perfume and Cosmetics Have Seen a Decline</p>
<p>In addition to tobacco and alcohol, women's cosmetics occupy an important position among luxury goods. According to statistics in the first half of the year, in Shanghai alone, it has reached more than 350,000 gold units, accounting for 63% of the total. The total for the whole country is more than 560,000 gold units. Among them, perfume and cosmetics are the most, followed by makeup products, and jewelry is the least. The import of perfume and cosmetics is the highest in the United States, followed by France and Germany. Japan also has a considerable number, second only to France. Comparing the first half of this year with the first half of last year, imports to Shanghai have decreased by more than 100,000 gold units, which shows that although women love beauty, their purchasing power has also weakened.</p>
<p>Radios and Cars Have Also Decreased</p>
<p>The import of other radios and cars are all starting from Shanghai. In the first half of the year, Shanghai imported a total of 1.08 million gold units of radios, with the United States accounting for the largest share and Japan ranking second. The United Kingdom, Germany, and the Netherlands also have more than 5,000 gold units. As for cars, although imports to Shanghai reached more than 1.19 million gold units in the first half of the year, it was a significant reduction compared with the same period last year. Imports from other coasts accounted for only 28%. However, in recent years, the construction of domestic highways has been extremely developed, and the demand for vehicles is bound to be greater. The import of long-distance buses is also not small. In summary, the decline in purchasing power in Shanghai has been an undeniable fact, and the prosperity of the city is only a superficial appearance.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Ordered to Cut Staff and Streamline Administration; Staff Welfare Association Presents Suggestions; General Manager Liu Promises Due Consideration</h3>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, following a ministerial order to cut staff and streamline administration, and under repeated urging from Director Gao Tingzi of the Navigation Administration Department to General Manager Liu Hongsheng for its implementation, is now in a state of imminent action. It is understood that Mr. Liu has already informed the heads of various departments to assess their subordinates and draw up a list of employees to be laid off for final decision. The heads of departments also held a meeting some days ago, but all felt it was difficult to cut further staff after several rounds of previous reductions, and a concrete plan has yet to be decided upon. The company's Staff Welfare Association also convened a joint meeting of various groups yesterday, deciding to present the following two suggestions to General Manager Liu and the department heads for their consideration: (1) The salaries of female staff in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are not very large in the overall expenditure. Therefore, in terms of tightening budgets and reducing expenses, attention should be focused on major items such as ship and warehouse repairs, and large quantities of metal and coal. (2) Even with staff reductions, fairness must be ensured. Ship and warehouse branches should be considered in a unified manner, and not only focus on staff within the head office. Moreover, ship crews are currently adding more watchmen and third mates, and the disparity in treatment between company staff and ship crews should not be too great. Furthermore, regarding the proposed transfer of the company's accounting department to the Ministry of Transportation's Chief Accountant's Office, which has been confirmed but not yet implemented, the company's Staff Welfare Association also discussed this matter and intends to politely request General Manager Liu to postpone its implementation until the political situation of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee is settled, to avoid unnecessary disputes. It is reported that Mr. Liu has promised to give due consideration to the aforementioned suggestions from the association.</p>
<h3>Five Provinces and Cities Transportation Conference: Shanghai Representatives Return; Drafting Report for Mayor's Review</h3>

<h3>German Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Kriebel, to Return Home</h3>
<p>According to the *North-China Daily News*, the German Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Kriebel, has recently been personally invited by the German head of state, Hitler, to participate in this year's Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. Therefore, Mr. Kriebel and his wife will return to Germany within days. Mr. and Mrs. Kriebel, who are currently on vacation in Japan, have already canceled all scheduled engagements and intend to depart via the Siberian Railway. The Congress is held every year on September 10th, and it is expected that 400,000 members of national Nazi Party organizations will participate, along with 25,000 members of other parties. Therefore, the total number of attendees will be approximately 650,000. In addition to inviting Mr. Kriebel to attend the Congress, Hitler has also requested Mr. Kriebel to stay in Germany until November 9th, as this day is the anniversary of the Nazi Party's first uprising in 1922 and is traditionally celebrated. According to an official from the German Consulate General, Mr. Kriebel is very enthusiastic about this celebration, as he was an active member during the uprising. During Mr. Kriebel's absence, the position of Consul-General will be held by Consul Hellendorf.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Issues New One Yuan Banknote</h3>
<p>According to the *Shen Shi News*, the Bank of China is now printing a new one-yuan banknote with a Shanghai denomination. The front features a picture of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing at the center and the words "Printed in the 24th Year of the Republic of China" at the bottom. The back features a model of a sailing ship one-yuan national coin in the center. The design is very beautiful. The new one-yuan banknote has been signed and stamped and began circulation yesterday. Citizens are advised to take note.</p>
<h3>Letters with Insufficient Postage Returned to Sender for Additional Payment; Public Advised to Note</h3>
<p>According to *Hua Dong News*, the Shanghai Postal Administration noted that senders of ordinary letters often mail overweight letters without weighing them at the post office, causing undue loss to the recipients, or even rejection if they refuse to pay the penalty postage. In order to prevent such incidents from occurring, a new procedure has been implemented. All letters with insufficient postage will be returned to the original sender for additional payment. The words "Insufficient postage… cents, returned to sender for payment" will be written on the letter. Once the sender receives the returned letter, they can pay the designated amount within two days (postage stamps already stamped are still valid, but the original letter cannot be opened) and mail it again. Citizens are advised to take note.</p>
<h3>Tang Shudong to Depart for the United States Tomorrow to Continue Studying Wood Science</h3>

<h3>Grand Spectacle at Flood Relief Amusement Fair; Flower Queen Election Voting Begins Today; Manufacturers Generously Donate Tickets</h3>
<p>The Flood Relief Amusement Fair, organized by various sectors of Shanghai, entered its second day yesterday after the opening ceremony. The number of visitors was greater than the previous two days, indicating that the public is still interested in entertainment and charitable contributions. A report of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Grand Spectacle</p>
<p>Yesterday was a regular Sunday holiday, so the venue was packed with people. All sections were full, with latecomers barely able to squeeze in, especially the famous flower performances and the half-length theater. Furthermore, a Western child named Fang Ximo, only eight years old, was able to sing songs from various countries with perfectly matched tunes, which was highly praised by the audience. It is said that this Western child was introduced to the fair by Mayor Wu and volunteered to come to the fair for half an hour each day to sing, demonstrating his enthusiasm for disaster relief. It is estimated that there were over five thousand visitors yesterday, with crowds everywhere, creating a magnificent spectacle. The order of the venue was maintained by the Boy Scout troop, so there was no confusion. Most of those who attended were members of the upper class.</p>
<p>Flower Queen Election Begins</p>
<p>In order to promote the sale of admission tickets, the fair launched a flower queen election to attract the attention of the sisters in the northern district, so as to sell more tickets and benefit the victims of the disaster. The elected titles are as follows: Flower Queen President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Speaker of the Senate, Deputy Speaker, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Deputy Speaker, Minister of Appearance, Deputy Minister, Minister of Talent, Deputy Minister, Minister of Virtue, Deputy Minister, Minister of Sexuality, Deputy Minister, Minister of Art, Deputy Minister, Minister of Skill, Deputy Minister, etc. In addition to receiving awards and medals from the fair, the winners will also receive valuable daily necessities donated by national product factories. The fair has also commissioned the *Citizens Daily* to publish a special edition of the flower queen election. The ballot papers are included with the admission tickets. Starting today, a large ballot box will be set up at the entrance on the second floor to facilitate voting. It is expected that there will be a heated competition among the famous flowers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Today's Program</p>
<p>Today, there will be over twenty variety shows and performances by various celebrities. In terms of Peking opera, the Dacheng Opera Troupe will be responsible, with the following programs: Ge Zaihua's *Mr. Jun Acts Benevolently and Gains a Son*, Chen Peng's *Fengming Pass*, Wan Yongquan's *Female Escort* (Chen Xuejun's *Little Yuans Gates Execution of Son*, Cao Zhenkang's *Two Generals*, Hu Shusen's *Baochan Sends Wine*, Ge Zaiding and Liu Guohua's joint performance of *Empty City Stratagem*, Miss Zhuang Guolan and Mr. Zhang Shengcun's joint performance of *Mother and Daughter Reunion*, Rong Ruichang, He Zuoying, Cao Zhenkang, Chen Peng, and Ge Zaiding's joint performance of *Yellow Crane Tower*, You Jusun, Qun Sun, Lantin Jun, Wang Yifang, Liu Junlin, Wu Defang, Yu Yaofang, Dong Yanfei, and Liu Zhikui's joint performance of *Evil Tiger Village*.

<p>Manufacturers Donate Tickets</p>
<p>Various factories and businesses in Shanghai believe that the fair's disaster relief efforts are essential, and are willing to help promote the sale of tickets. For example, the Asia America Fresh Orange Juice Company donates tickets with purchases. For every two dozen cases of Golden Camel brand fresh orange juice or Polo juice purchased from the company, one admission ticket is donated to the fair. For every five dozen cases purchased, three tickets are donated. Similarly, the *Citizens Daily* newspaper donates one ticket for every half-year subscription. Furthermore, the Yuan Tai Arts and Crafts Company and the Hong Tai Industrial Company donate one ticket for every purchase of five yuan or more, with proportional increases for larger purchases. It is reported that various factories participating in the National Products World are also planning to donate tickets with purchases and are currently in negotiations. It is hoped that major manufacturers in Shanghai will follow suit and generously donate tickets. Selling one more ticket can potentially save one more disaster victim.</p>
<h3>Rent Reductions Demanded by Nanjing Road Shops Gradually Materializing</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's business sector has been depressed and has not yet recovered, and the economy is at its breaking point. Shops in the Public Concession's Nanjing Road area, which is known as a prosperous center, have also been affected. They once jointly sought economic recovery, but since the fundamental solution involved the entire country and could not be achieved overnight, they adopted immediate measures, aiming to reduce expenses, the largest of which was rent. Therefore, a rent reduction movement was launched. Since the movement was led by the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association under the jurisdiction of Nanjing Road, it has been going on for many months, and reports of the meeting situation have been published in this newspaper. It is now learned that all tenants under the landlords on the entire road have been divided into groups, and after negotiations with the owners, the matter is now nearing completion. The houses of a company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shimen Road have agreed to reduce the rent by 30%, charging 70% of the original rent. A certain bank that manages the rent has agreed to 80%. Negotiations for rent reduction at the building in front of the bowling alley have also been successful. In other cases, such as Tianfu South Goods Store and other single-house-single-owner cases, the rent has long been reduced. Except for the houses in Ju Li, Daqing Li, and De Yu Li, where the rent is relatively balanced, the tenants will not demand rent reductions for the time being. Only about 20 houses of a famous foreign company have not yet been settled. However, according to the tenants of this group, because there is evidence of various facts and reasons, they will eventually achieve the goal of rent reduction regardless of any setbacks.</p>
<h3>Children's Year Implementation Association Plans to Establish Children's Cinema; Delegates Plans to Hu Shuyi Etc. for Review</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Year Implementation Association held its seventh meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau the other day. Those present included Sun Yongyi, Wang Gang, Hu Shuyi, and ten others. Mr. Zhang Binghui chaired the meeting, and Mr. Guo served as the recorder. The chairman reported: (A) The draft implementation work procedures of the association have been submitted to Commissioner Jiang Jianbai for review by the third standing committee meeting, but have not yet been completed. (B) The opening ceremony budget has been approved by the municipal government. Next, Commissioner Sun reported on the opening ceremony and the amount of various expenses on that day. Matters discussed: (1) The association's budget proposal was resolved to be submitted to the standing committee to convene responsible conveners of various groups to review. (2) The proposal to establish the Shanghai Children's Cinema was resolved to be delegated to Committee Members Hu Shuyi and Xu Gongmei to prepare a detailed plan and submit it to the standing committee for review. (3) The proposal to establish a children's problem counseling center and a parents' association was resolved to be held until the National Children's Year Implementation Committee issues the measures to the association, and then it will be held.</p>
<h3>Ruan Kaiji Talks About Impeachment Case; Claims to Be Innocent; Thorough Investigation Will Clarify the Truth</h3>
<p>Ruan Kaiji, the head of the Xin Zha Public Security Sub-bureau, was sued by dismissed bureau members Zheng Zuhan, police officer Peng Wenwei, and resigned secretary Gong Qizhang to the Control Yuan for illegal dereliction of duty. Reporters from various newspapers, in order to understand the details of the charges, specifically visited Sub-bureau Head Ruan at the Xin Zha Sub-bureau yesterday. The details of Mr. Ruan's statements are recorded as follows: Reporter asked, yesterday's newspapers in this city carried a case of the Control Yuan impeaching you. Can you tell us the details of the charges? Mr. Ruan replied, I am deeply ashamed. I am incompetent and inexperienced. I have been promoted by the superior and appointed as the head of this bureau. For several months, I have been conscientious and diligent, dutiful and law-abiding, and buried in hard work. Later, because the discipline was too strict, it caused the malice of the dismissed personnel, which is the origin of the charges. Asked, are the seven cases of Yang Zuozi in the Control Yuan's impeachment case the same cases that were investigated by the local court last time? Answered, yes, the above seven cases have been examined and defended according to law, and have been interrogated in court. The court upheld justice and ruled that the charges should not be prosecuted according to law. In the first ten days of the month, the prosecutor collected the original case files and submitted a statement to the Shanghai Local Civil Service Disciplinary Committee for review. Whether it is illegal or not will soon come to light. Asked, what is the situation regarding the recommendation of a dismissed police chief and the misappropriation of the coachman's salary? Answered, first, it was introduced by the General Bureau's Office of Hearing (i.e., duty officer) and sent to the General Bureau for examination and passed. The General Bureau recruited him as a police officer. I really did not know that Ling Shaoxuan was the pseudonym of Ling Ziao, the dismissed police chief during Gong's tenure as sub-bureau head. And I have never met him before, how can I know the inside story of whether he accepted bribes? There are witnesses, which can be investigated. Second, when I arrived at the bureau, in addition to the three police officers who received subsidies for writing, there were indeed five vacancies. In fact, it was also to make up for the lack of office funds. However, I always felt it was inappropriate, so I successively filled the quota and the General Bureau sent someone to inspect the bureau and there were no errors. Only at the time of inspection I was attending a meeting at the General Bureau, which is why one coachman did not respond to the roll call. The above two points have also been truthfully stated to the Shanghai Local Civil Service Disciplinary Committee. In short, I believe that this internal investigation can clarify the truth of my actions after arriving at the bureau.</p>
<h3>Municipal Children's Welfare Association to Continue Establishing Second Labor Day Care Center; Located in the Labor District of Tapping Tree Dike in Eastern Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Day Care Center, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Children's Welfare Association, first established the First Labor Day Care Center near Banfang on Penglai Road. Since its establishment, it has been half a year and it has greatly benefited the working children of Shanghai. The management of the center has also been quite successful. It is understood that the establishment of the Second Day Care Center can be realized soon. Currently, this motion has been approved by the meeting and a decision has been made to hold it. The location of the Second Labor Day Care Center will be set up in the labor district of Yangshupu in eastern Shanghai. However, funds are currently unavailable and must be raised.</p>
<h3>North German New Ship, "Bremen," to Sail to Japan This Morning; Returns to Shanghai on the 27th; Passengers Return to Germany Next Month; Reception Held Last Night to Welcome Crew</h3>
<p>The second express liner of the North German Lloyd shipping company, the "Bremen," arrived in Shanghai on the 16th. The previous two days, it separately invited celebrities from various Chinese and Western circles in Shanghai and reporters from various newspapers to visit the ship. Many people were invited, and the equipment of the ship was praised by all circles. The German General Association in this port, in order to welcome the ship owner Arens and all the crew of the "Bremen," which is its maiden voyage to Shanghai, specifically held a Sino-German reception at 6:30 PM last night at the Liva Piao Sister Village on the opposite side of the Toyota Yarn Factory on the west side of Zhaofeng Garden in western Shanghai, in order to connect the feelings of Chinese and German officials and people. No less than 500 people from all Chinese and Western circles arrived. The Bremen Orchestra played new music, and there were electric fireworks, gun salutes, dancing, singing, and other entertainment to entertain the guests. It was dispersed at around 11:00 PM, which was very grand for a time. The ship has departed from Shanghai this morning and is heading to Japan, passing through Yokohama, Kobe, and other places along the way. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 27th, stay in Shanghai for four days, load passengers and cargo, and then set sail for Germany again on September 1st.</p>
<h3>The Honor of Old Painter Li Xia</h3>
<p>The famous old painter Li Xia is good at drawing figures. Last year, he was invited by Xiong Shihui, the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, to tour Jiangxi with his brush. Chairman Xiong opened the East Hall of the Provincial Government as a planned exhibition hall for Mr. Li. At that time, Chairman Chiang was stationed in Nanchang, and important officials of the Jiangxi Provincial Government gathered in Jiangxi. Mr. Li's works were deeply appreciated by the important officials. Recently, at the invitation of several acquaintances in Shanghai, he exhibited more than a hundred of his recent works at the New World Hotel starting from the 15th. Over the days, many Chinese and Western people visited the site. The *North-China Daily News* and the *China Press* praised Mr. Li's works very much. It is reported that the exhibition period is only five days, from the 15th to the 19th.</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* on August 16th wrote, Mr. Li Xia's national book exhibition started yesterday at the New World Hotel. This Chinese painting exhibition is a great expression of the standing of modern Chinese art in the cultural sphere and occupies a considerable position. It also allows foreigners to understand the wonderful art of the East so that they can understand the essence of ancient Chinese traditions and know the way to control Oslo's secret path. All kinds of exhibitions are purely water paintings. The red, yellow, and blue colors used are well-matched, attracting people to study everywhere. The exhibits are mostly famous stories from ancient times and history, mixed with Buddhist legends. The most touching ones are the figures of Dharma, Arhats, and Guan Yu, which can be seen actively on paper.</p>
<h3>Investigation and Prohibition of Carelessly Grazing Cattle on Automobile Roads</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received a report from the Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company stating that the width of the Shanghai Songhui Road in Songjiang and the Shanghai Beihui Road is only nine feet. Large and small vehicles come and go frequently. Drivers must pay attention to avoiding pedestrians. If cattle are carelessly grazed, driving will be more difficult. The peasants are ignorant and cannot be persuaded. Driving is dangerous and makes people feel apprehensive. A request has been made to issue a notice to prohibit such actions. After receiving the report, County Chief Ye not only ordered the Public Security Bureau to inform all households and investigate and prohibit such actions at any time, but also issued a notice yesterday informing farmers not to graze cattle and sheep on the roads to avoid danger and facilitate traffic. Those who dare to violate the ban will be arrested and punished.</p>
<h3>Murderer Chen Jinlan to Be Imprisoned for More Than Thirteen More Years</h3>
<p>Murderer Chen Jinlan from Ningbo was arrested for killing Chen Zhikui, the young owner of the Qian Fengtai Candle Store. The French Concession Police Department sent him to the Second Special Court and sentenced him to 15 years in prison. After three trials, the sentence was reduced to 12 years. Before the Higher Court could deliver his verdict, the criminal damaged the gate lock of the Second Special Court Detention Center and escaped to Hankou. Not long after, he sneaked back to Shanghai and was arrested by the French Concession Police Department on April 16th of this year. He was sent to the Second Special Court and sentenced to four years in prison. His appeal to the Higher Third Branch Court was rejected and the sentence has been finalized. The prosecutor of the Higher Court requested the Criminal Court to merge the sentences for the two crimes and execute them together. The Criminal Court ruled that Chen Jinlan should be sentenced to 14 years and 6 months of imprisonment. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Judge Wang of the Execution Court of the Higher Third Branch Court held a hearing, ordered Chen to be brought to the case, and asked about his age and place of origin. He then announced that for the two crimes of murder and escape, he should be sentenced to 14 years and 6 months of imprisonment. After deducting the number of days of detention in the detention center, with two days equivalent to one day of imprisonment, 10 months and 18 days are deducted. He should still be imprisoned for 13 years, 7 months, and 12 days, calculated to be released from prison in mid-April of the 37th year of the Republic of China. The criminal acknowledged and was taken down by the bailiff and sent to the Xiu 2 Prison on Route Massenet to serve his sentence.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Lawyer; Abducting a Young Woman and Forcing Her to Terminate Her Engagement</h3>
<p>Yu Sichen, a 19-year-old daughter of Yu Chen, a resident of No. 14 Dongyu Genglang Lane, north of Meilong Town in western Shanghai, was engaged to Zhang Jianren, a farmer from No. 5 Tiantu Village, near her hometown, to be married this winter. However, Chu Yougen, a local resident of No. 16 next door, who works as a tea boy in a certain school in Shanghai, would always instigate Yu Chen and her daughter to terminate the engagement with the Zhang family every time he returned home, saying that he had a friend from Hangzhou named Zhou Pei who was not yet married and was working as a lawyer in Shanghai. After the termination of the engagement, he could introduce Sichen to him. The Yu Chen mother and daughter were bewitched by him, so they entrusted lawyer Zhou Pei to handle the termination of the engagement with the Zhang family. They also packed their clothes and prepared to escape to Shanghai. The day before yesterday afternoon, Zhou Pei, who was impersonating a lawyer, went to Zhang Jianren's house with Chu Yougen to force the termination of the engagement. Zhang insisted on refusing, which led to a quarrel between the two sides. Later, someone reported it to the Meilong Town Guard Group Branch, which detained Zhang Jianren, Chu Yougen, Zhou Pei, Yu Chen, and Yu Sichen, and confiscated four clothing packages (about dozens of pieces) from Chu Yougen's home. After a brief interrogation, they were all sent to the Caojing Police Station. After questioning by Director Wu, Zhou Pei claimed to be 27 years old, from Hangzhou, residing in the Chengfeng Tobacco and Paper Store on Fanghong Road, and currently unemployed. He denied impersonating a lawyer. The director believed that the case involved allegations of conspiracy and abduction, as well as impersonating a lawyer, which was extremely illegal. Therefore, he prepared a document and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Liu Shangyu Injured by Car Accident</h3>

<h3>Aviation - A Grand Arts and Entertainment Event</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China Aviation Association's Mobilization Team, in conjunction with the Star Motion Picture Company, held an aviation arts and entertainment event at Lafayette Garden at 8:00 PM the night before last. The chairman, Li Dachao, first gave a report, saying in brief: "Tonight, this association, with the help of Mobilization Team leaders Zhang Shichuan of Team 74 and Ms. Hu Die of Team 302, is holding this aviation arts and entertainment gathering. The entire cast of male and female stars from the Star Motion Picture Company will perform novel songs and dances, as well as the play 'The Wife of the Republic of China.' We are also grateful to Lafayette Garden for providing the venue. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used to solicit donations. We are very grateful for the enthusiastic participation of guests from all walks of life, and we hope for more efforts to help and support the mobilization movement." He then introduced Zhang Shichuan of the Star Motion Picture Company to report on the preparations, followed by Ms. Hu Die, who reported on the song and dance programs of the female stars. For the past two nights, Ms. Die led the performance of various amazing programs, novel songs and dances, and also performed the patriotic comedy "The Wife of the Republic of China," which contained aviation ideas. The audience was packed, and the atmosphere at the venue was extremely enthusiastic. The office also sent Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Li Jimin, Zhu Shengyang, Gu Shangrui, Bao Lengxue, Li Wenyao, Xue Baolun, and others to provide attentive service, and the order was well maintained. In addition to Hu Die, the participating actors included Wang Huijuan, Gao Qianping, Ye Qiuxin, Li Qiuchen, Shu Xiuwen, Huang Naishuang, Yan Yuexian, Xu Lai, Gu Dingjun, Yuan Shaomei, Wang Xianzai, Gao Guiping, Gong Jianong, Wang Jiting, Mei Xi, and Zhu Guyan, among others, who performed singing programs. Ms. Li Qiuchen performed fashion shows, Ms. Xu Lai performed "White Orchid," Huang Naishuang performed a rice planting song, Ye Qiuxin performed "Fragrant Night," Yan Yuexian performed "Phoenix Seeking Mate," and Gu Dingjun performed "Descending to the Jade Pavilion." The plot of the play is roughly as follows: Ling Ayun (played by Hu Die) is a female worker. She originally had a lover, Hu Xiangsheng (played by Gao Zhanfei), and they were engaged to be married. However, her mother (played by Shu Xiuwen) was unwilling for her to marry the penniless Xiangsheng. However, she did not think it right for her mother to interfere in her lifelong affair. Ayun used the money she earned from her work, after deducting household expenses, to buy an aviation lottery ticket, and unexpectedly won the first prize. Newspaper reporters (played by Gong Jianong and Mei Xi) naturally came to interview her immediately, and Xiangsheng was also very happy for her. Those who previously disliked her for being poor and were unwilling to marry her also came to propose marriage. However, even though she won the first prize, she did not enjoy it herself but donated it all to the government to buy two airplanes. Therefore, she said herself, "I am still a poor person," but no one believed it. Four self-proclaimed extraordinary people (played by Wang Xianzai, Wang Jiting, You Guangzhao, and Xie Yunqing) came to ask Ayun to marry them. Ayun felt that such a situation was simply unmanageable. Therefore, she used this situation to issue another three million lottery tickets. All the prizes would be donated to the government to buy twenty airplanes. Whoever won the first prize would marry her. Therefore, all those who proposed to her went to buy lottery tickets, not only to win the prize but also to marry Ayun. When Xiangsheng learned of this method, he was naturally a little sad. However, after Ayun explained, he understood that Ayun was marrying the country for the sake of righteousness. How could he bear to claim this wife of the Republic of China for himself?</p>
<p>Since the Mobilization Team office officially began collecting aviation donations of one cent each throughout the city on the 15th, the results have been excellent. Dance halls such as the Cosmopolitan, St. Anna, Vienna, Great Shanghai Garden, Great East, Jiezi, Lafayette, International, Old Dahua, Moon Palace, Dahua, Great Hu, and nightclubs have been particularly helpful in assisting the effort. Customers have been able to donate enthusiastically, and some have donated three or four cents per entrance, which shows that the people of the country are making great efforts to support the mobilization movement. The office also sent a letter to the municipal government requesting assistance in maintaining order while collecting aviation donations. It is reported that the letter has been received, and the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus have been ordered to comply with and maintain order.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Detectives Disguised Themselves to Arrest Thieves - Gunshots Filled Dananmen - Bandits Opened Fire and Killed a Three-Year-Old Child - Four Thieves Arrested After Pursuit</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, a large number of detectives, all in disguise, were guarding and arresting thieves on the west side of Dananmen on Zhonghua Road in the South City. The reason was that they had received a tip that the thieves planned to rob a certain family on the west side of Dananmen, and had agreed to meet there at 11:00 AM yesterday to carry out the robbery. Therefore, detectives from the Zhabei Branch and detectives from the Xundao Street Police Station were scattered in the area. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 AM, a robber wearing a short shirt and trousers of dark silk gauze, with a burly figure, rode a bicycle from east to west, speeding past. It seemed that he had arrived at the destination first to test for danger before carrying out the robbery. As the robber was stretching his head to look around on the bicycle, he was spotted by the informant. With a secret signal, the detectives rushed up and surrounded him on all sides, immediately capturing the robber and the bicycle together. A search of his person found nothing. For a time, there were many onlookers. Unexpectedly, while the commotion was going on, the informant again identified a young man wearing a white Indian silk short shirt and trousers in the crowd as a member of the thief gang. Therefore, the young man was also arrested. (However, according to a subsequent investigation, the young man was actually an apprentice in a hemp rope shop at the Great Pier, and was mistakenly arrested while passing through the area.) In an instant, another robber came from south to north. When he reached the entrance of Dananmen, he caught sight of the detectives arresting thieves on the west side. The robber was frightened and ran north. He was seen by the detectives, who chased after him. The robber had just escaped to the vicinity of Baimiao Lane, Fumin Road, inside Dananmen. Seeing that the pursuers were catching up, he turned around and opened fire to resist arrest. Unexpectedly, a stray bullet hit the temple of Hu Jindi, the three-year-old son of Hu Changgui, who lived at No. 407 Fumin Road in the area. He fell to the ground injured, bleeding profusely. At that time, gunshots filled the air, and pedestrians ran to take cover. As a result, the robber who opened fire was finally captured, and a pistol was found on the ground. Another robber also escaped from Fumin Road into Huangjia Road, turned north into Huayuan Lane, Yujia Lane, and ran straight to Qiaojia Road before being arrested. A total of four thieves were arrested before and after, and taken to the Xundao Street Police Station. After a brief interrogation by Director Jin Dianyang, they were taken back to the Zhabei Branch by the detectives for thorough investigation. The injured child, Hu Jindi, was taken to Shanghai Hospital by his family for treatment. Unfortunately, due to the injury to a vital part of the head, he could not be saved and died in the hospital at around 2:00 PM. According to the father of the deceased, Hu Changgui, 35 years old from Wenzhou, he ran a tin shop. His wife, Hu Zhu, was 31 years old and had two children, a daughter, Lin Ying, 5 years old, and a son, Jin Di (the deceased), 3 years old. At the time of the incident, Hu Zhu was strolling at the door with Jin Di when the tragedy occurred. According to people, the thieves' planned to rob the home of the late local gentleman Mo Zijing on the west side of Dananmen. Because some of the accomplices distributed the spoils unevenly after robbing a certain family, they told on each other. As a result, the Mo family was safe.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's High Tide - Continued Backflow onto the Roads - The Tide Will Return to Normal After Today - There Will Be a High Tide from the 13th to the 16th of Next Month</h3>
<p>Since the continuous high tide occurred in the Huangpu River on the 14th, the low-lying roads in this city began to be flooded on the 16th. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, the side of Wing On Company on Zhejiang Road, as well as Gansu Road, Avenue Albert, and the front of China General Edison Company on Sichuan Road, experienced backflow from the sewers again, with water accumulating on the roads to a depth of several inches. At dawn today and around 4:00 PM this afternoon, the above-mentioned roads are still likely to be flooded. From tomorrow, the situation will return to normal, as the tide has receded to below ten feet. Although there are still four days of high tide at the end of the month, the amount is only around eleven feet, which is not worth paying attention to unless there are strong winds and storms. However, from the 12th to the 16th of next month, there will be four days of high tide, which, according to the Junpu Bureau's prediction, will exceed this month's high flood, and should not be ignored.</p>

<h3>He Fu, Liquidator of American Oriental Banking Corporation, Sues Lei Wenshu and His Nephew Again - Recovering $225,000</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, He Fu, the liquidator of the American Oriental Banking Corporation, sued Lei Wen, the former manager of the bank, and his nephew Walter Lei Wen, the former deputy manager of the bank, in the U.S. Court for China on Saturday. The reason for the lawsuit is that Lei Wen borrowed $169,000 from the bank in the form of promissory notes. With interest, he still owes about $120,000. Lei Wen also overdrafted $69,000 from the bank. Lei Wen's nephew had promissory notes worth $6,000 U.S. dollars signed by himself that were overdue and unpaid, and he also overdrafted $30,000 from the bank. The total amount requested to be recovered is $225,000. Previously, He Fu had filed a lawsuit in the U.S. Court to recover 400,500 taels of silver in rewards given to Lei Wen and others by the American Oriental Banking Corporation and three other companies. Including this case, the amount that He Fu has requested the U.S. Court to recover has reached a huge sum of 800,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Two Women Commit Suicide by Poisoning - Tobacco Seller Sentenced</h3>
<p>Mai Ailian and Feng Baozhen, Cantonese women residing at No. 11 Peng Road, suddenly developed a pessimistic view of life in the middle of the twelfth of this month and bought opium to swallow in an attempt to commit suicide. They were discovered by someone and sent to Shanghai Convalescent Hospital for treatment. Feng died despite the rescue efforts, and Mai recovered. Chen Xikang, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Patrol Room, learned that the opium had been bought by Mai from Li Quan, a Cantonese man at No. 644 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. At 8:50 PM the day before yesterday, he secretly went to the address and arrested Li, confiscating two cans of opium, three taels of opium dross, and a set of smoking paraphernalia, and took them all to the patrol room for detention. The next morning, he escorted them to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated the previous situation and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law, requesting investigation. Then, according to Detective Chen's report on the course of events, the exhibits were submitted for inspection. According to Mai's statement, she bought opium from the defendant for twelve cents at the time, which was the truth. The defendant admitted it without denial. Judge Xiao Bianfen sentenced Li Quan to one year of imprisonment and a fine of fifty yuan, and the exhibits were confiscated as listed.</p>
<h3>Tongren Fuyuan Hall Receives Another Letter from a Dancer About to Drown Herself - The Letter Describes Her Unfortunate Experiences with Unusual Sorrow - An Enclosed Letter to Li Peijun Asks for Help to Claim the Body</h3>
<p>At the beginning of last month, the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall at No. 6 Ningbo Road, French Concession, received a report of a suicide by drowning, requesting assistance in recovering and burying the body. After it was published in the newspaper, it seemed that a new trend of committing suicide by drowning had emerged for a time. From then on, the hall successively received more than a dozen similar letters every other day, all of which were forwarded to the Nanshi Lifesaving Bureau, asking them to pay attention to recovering the bodies. This has been reported in this newspaper several times, but the Lifesaving Bureau has never recovered the body of a single person, which is extremely strange. This trend gradually subsided. Yesterday, the hall received another letter delivered by the post office, sent from this city. Upon opening the letter, it was signed by Hua Lizhu, a weak woman from Yang County, Jiangsu Province, announcing her suicide by drowning and requesting the hall to recover and bury her body. There was also an enclosed letter to Li Peijun, consisting of four sheets of stationery. The handwriting of both letters was old and elegant, and the writing was clear and coherent, seemingly not written by a woman. In the letter to Li, she described her bitter life, having worked as a dancer in the Great Shanghai dance hall. She was deceived by Sun Zhendong, suffered harm, and was abandoned. With no one to rely on, she was forced to commit suicide. The two letters are recorded as follows: The letter to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall reads: "Respected Sirs, I am the weakest woman in the world. I have no hope for anything in this world, so I am throwing myself into the Wusong River. I believe that your hall specializes in good deeds and will surely show compassion. Although I have written another letter to Mr. Li Peijun, I do not know if he is currently in Shanghai. Please publish this letter in the major newspapers of Shanghai, so that Mr. Li can read it and the hall can be spared the expense of a coffin. Li Peijun used to live on East Zilaishui Street, French Concession, Shanghai, but I forgot the number. Mr. Li is from Dapu, Guangdong, with the courtesy name Menghao and the alias Chayang Henren, father's name Junchen. I also ask the newspapers of Shanghai not to begrudge a corner of their news columns to publish the above facts. Sincerely addressed to the gentlemen of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. Furthermore, this letter can be collected in person by its relatives from your esteemed hall. Sincerely, Hua Lizhu, a weak woman from Wu County, Jiangsu, September 14th, written in my residence in Suzhou." The letter to Li Peijun reads: "Brother Peijun, I have always wanted to write to you and talk, but I lacked the courage. I also wanted to visit you in person, so the bitterness in my heart for four years has never been relieved. The suffering is obvious. I am a weak woman who lost her father early and recently lost her support again. I lament my orphaned life. Women in ancient and modern times have never been as miserable as me. Since I was misunderstood and abandoned by you after believing in rumors, my heart has been unwilling. I litigated with Ms. Zhang Susu, but failed again. I begged her to find a way to help me, but I was rejected. All for the sake of my dear mother's joy, I wanted to find a suitable position in society to provide shelter for my mother and daughter, but I hated having no real talent. Driven by the environment and forced by hunger and cold, I had to sacrifice my beauty, apply powder, learn Zhao Feiyan's dance, and make a living. Two or three years ago, when I appeared in the Great Shanghai dance hall, although I earned a meager income, it was enough to keep my mother and daughter warm and fed. However, unfortunate people often have little room for happiness before being envied by heaven. Moreover, in this world of gold and paper, even people with hearts of stone cannot help but be moved, let alone me. At that time, there was a person named Sun Zhendong, the son of a wealthy family, who feigned diligence and deceived me. One mistake led to another, leading to a loss of reputation. Because the seeds of disaster were sown, worries suddenly arose. I fell ill for a month and accidentally took pills that caused me to miscarry. As a result, I lost my source of income. I became frail, and my skills were no longer sufficient. My mother felt sorry for my life's encounters and passed away in less than a week. Alas, I previously lived only for my mother. Now that she is gone, there is no reason for me to keep this ill-fated body in the world. Therefore, today I force myself to pick up a pen, muster my courage, because you praised me for my knowledge of water skills. I have not forgotten our past relationship, and I am talking to you in the most sincere way. I hope you will not blame me for being a despicable woman, but I have entrusted my whole life to you. Even in death, I have no place to bury my body, because I am so orphaned. If you have not forgotten our past feelings, please come and recover my body from the Wusong River after seeing the newspaper. I will die in peace. The early autumn dew is heavy, so please do not think of my suffering in death, but fulfill my request. Sincerely, I wish you a bright future. Written by Hua Lizhu on September 14 in Wu County." The hall notified the Lifesaving Bureau to pay attention to recovering the body from the Huangpu River and the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<h3>Nanshan Road Kidnapping Case Solved - The Hostage Was Found Hidden in a Boat in the Reeds - 18 Male and Female Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>Xiang Dianchang, who opened a business on Oujia Road in Hongkou and Xiang Yixing, the owner of the Nanshan Foundry on Hongshan Road in Zhabei, were kidnapped by bandits after going to worship Buddha in the Buddha hall built by Xiang himself on the north side of Gonghexin Road at about 7:00 AM on the 20th of last month. Ji Yuanpu, the captain of the Detective Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Deputy Captain Wang recently ordered Bao Ziying, the captain of the Xinzha sub-team, to speed up the investigation. Captain Bao went out to investigate in all directions. Until the afternoon before yesterday, according to squad leader Liu Changpei's confidential report, the kidnappers in this case were hiding in room 7 of the Defeng Western Restaurant at No. 2 Taofenfeisi Road, Luban Road, French Concession. Captain Bao sent Deputy Captain Shi Zuhan, squad leader Liu Changpei, Dong Wenrui, detectives Zang Nai, Zhang Shuwen, Mao Gongzhao, Yang Yucai, Yi Ruifu, Zhou Deming, Fang Chaofu, Cai Jilin, Gao Changgui, Zhong Da, Li Guiqing, Sun Youzhi, etc. that night to the Lujiawan Patrol Room, and sent Chinese detectives Xia Zhenglong and Lu Dongliang to assist. As expected, Zhou Shishi, Chen Bingsheng, Wu Xingsheng, Li Jinshan, and Zheng Yushi were arrested in the Defeng Restaurant, and Zheng Changqing, Gu Jiafu, Gu Yuanshi, and Gu Jigen were arrested separately at Nos. 26 and 27 Huangjiabang Road, Jin Shenfu Road. After Chen Bingsheng confessed that the accomplices in this case, Wang Zhonghong and others, were hiding at No. 62 and a half Madeli Road, Changbang Road, British Concession, Captain Bao personally led detectives Fang Chaofu, Gao Changgui, Zhou Deming, and Yang Yucai to the Chengdu Road Patrol Room to assist in the arrest. After guarding until late at night, Wang Zhonghong was seen returning home and arrested. Wan Junming, Zheng Jinshui (who drove the car during the kidnapping), and Yuan Jinmei (i.e., Yuan Chenshi) were also arrested in various places. After being brought back, it was learned from the interrogation that the hostage was hidden in a boat in the reeds in a small port next to the Shanghai County Police Cemetery in Huangjiadu, at the junction of Shanghai County and Nanhui County. After obtaining this information, the team dispatched detectives and rushed to the scene, accompanied by Shen Huanlun, the director of the Second Branch of the Shanghai County Police Bureau, and sent patrol officer Wang Deji, leading police chief Zhu Chengdong, and Shi Tingji to the destination. Unexpectedly, the bandits had already noticed. It is said that they opened fire to resist arrest and fled while fighting. However, the hostage was unable to hide and was abandoned on the boat. As a result, detectives Zang Nai and Zhang Shuwen boarded the boat and rescued the hostage Xiang Yi and also arrested Ji Weiqing and Chen Zhang, who were guarding the hostage (there were two small boats in total), Chen Zhaoming, and the boat woman Lu Zhangshi, and Zhangshi's seven-year-old child, Lu Liannu. At about 5:00 AM yesterday, patrol officer Wang Deji of the Second Branch of the Shanghai County Police Bureau accompanied them to Shanghai. Director Ruan ordered the photography studio to take a group photo of the personnel who made contributions to the case in the courtyard of the bureau before dispersing. A total of eighteen male and female kidnappers and suspects arrested in this case have been temporarily taken into custody. It is also learned that the nine men and women arrested in the French Concession, after a brief interrogation of their ages and origins, have been sent back to the French Concession Patrol Room for interrogation by the French Court in the future.</p>
<h3>Minghua Bank Case - Starting with Liquidation First - Criminal Part Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>After the Minghua Bank collapsed, its creditors, because the liquidation of the bank was indefinite, filed criminal self-suits against the responsible directors, supervisors, and general managers for fraud. The First Special District Court has already ruled in the case filed by Le Junfen to temporarily suspend the criminal part, pending further application for clear liquidation before further review. Yesterday afternoon, the court summoned Yu Mingxun and other eighteen people to testify in the case against the bank's chairman Tong Jinyao, general manager Zhang Choubo, deputy manager Yu Dehua, and assistant manager Miao Wojin for fraud. Except for Zhang Choubo, who was still detained by the Public Security Bureau under the order of the Qingdao Municipal Government and could not be brought to court, Miao Zhendong rushed back from Qingdao and surrendered with Tong Yu. First, the plaintiff Yu Mingxun stated the amount of his deposit that had been lost. Then, he stated that the bank closed on May 24th, but on the afternoon of the 23rd, it still accepted deposits, issued promissory notes and checks, and used fraudulent means against depositors, so he filed a lawsuit. Tong Jinhui only admitted that he had served as chairman before 1931 and had never inquired about the bank's affairs after 1931. Yu Dehua stated that the Shanghai branch of Minghua Bank had losses last year, but if the Qingdao and Tianjin branches were combined, there would still be a surplus. The bank had been established for fifteen years. When it was registered with the ministry, it was said that the capital was 5 million, but the actual receipt was 2.75 million. It did not join the Bankers Association. This time, the Qingdao branch was the first to start the trend. The Shanghai branch received a telegram on the afternoon of May 23rd. At the same time, the silver and money industry also received the news and unanimously refused to deal with Minghua's bills. As a result, the Shanghai branch was unable to maintain operations and announced its closure. Miao Zhenhuo stated that the directors of Minghua were Tong Jinhui, Zhang Guangfu, Yu Yueting, Lin Erqing, Zhang Yifei, Lin Shenfu, and the general manager Zhang Tongbo. One or two days after the closure, a board meeting was still held, but only some of the directors attended, and Tong Jinhui did not attend that day. I just came from Qingdao. The Qingdao branch has debts of about 2.9 million and has not yet been closed, so Zhang is still being held in the Qingdao Public Security Bureau. The court ruled that the most important part of this case was the liquidation of the bank's accounts, and also ordered that the criminal part be temporarily suspended and that an application for liquidation be made to the civil court. After the liquidation is completed, it will be reviewed again.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West, Jessfield Road: Robbery and Gun Theft from Police; Zhabei Branch Captures Four Main Culprits and Recovers Firearm the Same Evening</h3>
<p>At 8:15 PM on the 17th, Ji Qingxi, a police officer on duty at post number 4 on Jessfield Road, Zhabei Public Security Branch, Shanghai West, was patrolling west when suddenly a person rushed towards him from the right front, throwing a bag of lime powder at his eyes. The officer was temporarily blinded. Another person stuffed lime powder into his mouth. The officer tried to grab them, but another person came from behind and held him tightly, snatching his gun and fleeing. The bandit whom the officer had initially caught managed to break free and escape as well, tearing his clothing in the process. The officer's Mauser pistol, number 536794, and whistle were stolen. Upon receiving the report, Director Tan Baoshou of the branch immediately led a large contingent of officers and detectives to search the area. Inspector Long Jianpo, detective Zhang Wenbin, and officer Yang Lieming pursued the suspects to the entrance of Yongting Lane on Jessfield Road. There, they saw a person covered in lime powder running into Yongting Lane. They chased him to the front of house number 4 in Yongting Lane, where, with the help of a civilian named He Yougen, they apprehended him. Under interrogation, he identified himself as Zhang Yubiao (alias Liu Lichang) and confessed that the robbery with Xu Zihua was instigated by Liu Fazhong. He also said that they had taken two bags of lime powder from Zhang Tongfu's house. Not far from the police post, Xu Zihua first threw lime powder at the police officer's eyes, then hugged the officer around the waist, grabbing the gun. He, Zhang Yubiao, stuffed lime powder into the officer's mouth. The officer grabbed him, but he managed to break free. Xu Zihua was staying at Zhang Tongfu's house. Zhang Tongfu worked as a gatekeeper at a certain theater in Wujiaochang and often went to the Siyanglou teahouse. The owner of Siyanglou knew his address. Liu Fazhong lived at number 380 Kangti Road in the French Concession. Director Tan then dispatched Inspector Wei Chen, along with detective foreman Liu Bingyuan, detective Song Ziming, and others, to the French Concession. Together with the Lujiawan police, they arrested Liu Fazhong at number 380 Kangti Road and temporarily detained him at that police station. Police were also sent to number 57 Xin Sen Lane to arrest Zhang Tongfu, but he was not found. Only his wife, Zhang Xu, was arrested. According to Xu Zipan's confession, he and Zhang Yubiao used lime powder to attack the police officer's eyes and steal the gun. Simultaneously, Inspector Long Jianpo, Gu Wentao, detective squad leaders Zhuang Dexiu, and Xin Jingsheng, along with detectives, and Nanshi West Gate Branch Station Road Police Chief Niu Jixun, apprehended Xu Zihua's wife, Xu Zhang, Zhang Yubiao's wife, Wang Di, and suspects Gao Buyun, Wang Huaiyou, Guo Kuiyun, Wang Chen, Gao Zhou, and seven others in total at number 31 Xiang Sheng Lane in the South Railway Station area. The stolen Mauser pistol (number 56794) was recovered from the attic of that address and taken back to the Zhabei Branch. Director Tan, branch officers Xing Yichun, Duan Dengdi, detective squad leader Zhuang Dexiu, deputy squad leader Xin Jingsheng, and others interrogated them separately. The details were documented and forwarded to the General Bureau.</p>

<h3>County Magistrate: Uniform Fare for Inland River Steamers Should Be Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction stating that the fare prices for inland river steamships have been set by the ship merchants themselves, without any standards. This has led to competition among the various shipping lines, who often disregard costs and arbitrarily lower prices to attract passengers. Once they reach a tacit understanding, they unite and raise fares in unison, monopolizing profits. Such fluctuating and uncertain prices are not beneficial to either the ship merchants or the passengers. It is necessary to investigate the actual situation in various places and stipulate steamship fares to restrict them. The county magistrate is instructed to conduct a thorough inquiry and, with reference to the recent business situation of the various ship merchants and the historical precedents for collecting fares, to draft reasonable maximum and minimum prices per kilometer and report them for review. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Ye immediately notified the various inland river steamship companies in Shanghai, Minhang, and other areas of the county to comply, and to promptly submit a detailed list of passenger fares and a summary of operating income and expenditures for the past three years for review.</p>

During this period, the inspection fee is 15 yuan per type, and the certificate stamp fee will still be paid as stipulated. If there are many types of prepared medicines for which inspection is requested, permission is granted to pay the stamp fee first, and the inspection fee will be paid upon receipt of the permit. (2) The general registration of prepared medicines is limited to the registration of the place of production. (3) The restrictions on poisonous and potent drugs in Article 8 of the Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines are revised as follows: A. If a poisonous and potent drug recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia is used, the amount per dose for internal medicine shall not exceed one-third of the single medicinal dose of the drug listed in the Pharmacopoeia. This restriction does not apply to external medicines, which will be assessed separately. B. If a poisonous and potent drug not recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia is used, the amount per dose shall be determined by this Ministry. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan for filing, you are instructed to inform [your members] immediately and promptly send them for inspection as required."</p>

Recently, it was learned that the factory has begun weaving cashmere spring and autumn shirts, new women's wool coats, scarves, sports shirts, children's shirts, and other winter wool products. It is expected that there will be a new contribution at that time.</p>

<h3>City Sounds</h3>
<p>Lida Factory Silver Thread Lace, Affordable and Popular: The Lida Mingji Lace Factory of Dapu Bridge in the French Concession produces various lace products with an independent trademark registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Trademark Bureau, selling throughout the country and achieving increasing business prosperity. The general distributor is located at Defeng Lace Shop in Yingchunfang, Daxin Street, Sanma Road. Recently, with the arrival of autumn, businesses from various ports believe that the factory's lace products are reliable and offer particularly low prices, so correspondence and personal visits to the general distributor have been continuous, making it extremely lively and bustling. Among them, the silver thread lace is particularly popular. It is said that the factory's silver thread lace is the result of in-depth research, investing effort into its creation, with patterns and colors that suit the times, colorful and dazzling, exquisitely beautiful. It is also said that the factory also produces knotted lace, which is also very popular. Compared with those who secretly skimp on materials, it is like mixing fish eyes with pearls, so buyers specify goods with an independent trademark. This shows that if Chinese people want to promote domestic products, they must first ensure the products are genuine and of good quality in order to be welcomed.</p>

Tumoling is available in three forms: solution, ointment, and powder, making it more convenient to use than any other skin disease medicine. As we are now in late summer and early autumn, when skin diseases are prone to occur, and people often suffer from itchy feet, everyone is worried about a lack of effective medicines. Therefore, since Tumoling's launch, purchases have been exceptionally enthusiastic, with orders from other locations arriving one after another, almost unable to meet demand.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in your newspaper's local news section regarding a fire on East Zilaihuo Street. I was shocked to read it. Upon investigation, a fire did occur near the intersection of Ningbo Road and West Zilaihuo Street at around 6:00 PM on the 17th, but it did not cause a major conflagration. It was not Zhang Yongxing's dowry shop, located at 156-158 East Zilaihuo Street. I hope you will correct this immediately.</p>
<p>Zhang Yongxing Dowry Shop, 156-158 East Zilaihuo Street, 18th.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Xin Ren)</p>
<p>No one doesn't want to be the eldest son, which is good, and also bad. A kitchen knife can cut vegetables, and also kill people, it all depends on how you use it.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "One monk carries water to drink, two monks carry water together, three monks have no water to drink." These simple three sentences completely express humanity's tendency to shirk responsibility. From this, one can also see that great men are often lonely.</p>
<p>People in society are like a bright little ball rolling on the high-level roulette of a table, bumping into nails everywhere. The road is made of nails. As for this bright little ball bumping into a five-thousandth-of-an-inch round eye, the matter is done with a twist, which is not because the bright little ball itself has any difference in value.</p>
<p>Summer says winter is better, winter says summer is happier. People are just like that, eating what's in their mouth, looking at what's in the pot, never satisfied.</p>
<h3>Flaming Mouth</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>After all, Shanghai is a big place, and there are many philanthropists. They not only think of convenience for the living but also take care of the hungry ghosts underground. Therefore, the annual Ullambana Festival is treated as a serious matter by everyone. Various guilds, public offices, and neighborhoods burn silver foil high, and Buddhist chants are loud. If there really are unsacrificed lonely souls in hell, they have food, clothing, and use here, which is ten times happier than the farmer's autumn harvest! But are the hungry ghosts really benefiting? We have no way to investigate. However, the factual presentation also benefits from the hungry ghosts. Should we count the benevolent believers who initiate the Ullambana Festival? And the virtuous monks who preside over the merits. They fooled around for a while, and unknowingly, the "mic" "mic" in their pockets increased.</p>
<p>The most important work of the Ullambana Festival is the Altar of Flaming Mouth. It is said that many hungry ghosts were originally so hungry that they spewed flames from their mouths, suffering unbearably. Relying on the power of the Buddha, sprinkling my drop of spiritual water, and throwing a few grains of rice, the fire of hunger was completely extinguished, and their whole bodies felt comfortable. Each and everyone happily jumped and bowed with joined palms. These need not be said, even the high monks cleared their throats, tuned the instruments, and added new equipment, cassocks, electric light arrangements, altar instruments, and Buddha statues, all decorated with small electric lights, are enough to attract the surrounding faithful men and women to watch, applaud, and cheer. Logically, the main object of this Altar of Flaming Mouth is the hungry ghosts, and the people watching are only incidental. Now that people are saying it's good, the hungry ghosts are of course even more joyful, in awe.</p>
<p>Buddhist scriptures came from India, and although translated into Chinese, they still carry some Sanskrit flavor. Only the classic recited during the Flaming Mouth ceremony, with its parallel four-character and six-character phrases, is neat and elegant, like reading a short essay by Tang and Song people; especially the section "With one mind, I beseech... to receive the nectar taste" is even more wonderful. It is rumored that this great work was done by Su Dongpo, because he made friends with Buddha Seal, and was willing to write it and send it to him. Whether it is reliable or not, is unknown, but in short, this work must come from a famous writer, that can be said for sure.</p>

<h3>Nanchang in Summer</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Spending summer in Nanchang can be considered a hardship. Soda water costs 30 cents per bottle, and ice-cold soda water costs an extra half cent. Watermelons are sold by the catty, costing 350 cash per sea catty, with a load selling for eight dollars. Who can afford to eat them? Therefore, ice cream parlors are as developed as bamboo shoots after a rain. Fruit stalls selling ice cream are their regular business, and bicycle shops and pancake shops also sell ice cream. Schools also treat opening ice cream parlors as summer assignments. Baihuazhou Primary School, Zhengmeng Primary School, Xinmin Primary School, etc., have long had ice cream shops open. Xinyuan Middle School shows open-air movies, which can be considered a different approach. Ice cream shops use female servers as a selling point, with advertisements saying "Specially hired beautiful female servers from Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan," attracting curious passersby to peek at the door.</p>
<p>It hasn't rained for a long time, so fires are prevalent. Since the big fire at the Guachi gas station on Zhongshan Road on July 25, which killed four people and destroyed more than 20 homes, there have been an average of two or three fires every day. Nanchang's fire brigade is still using coal-fired long-chimney water dragons. When a neighbor's house burns down, the other neighbors set off firecrackers to celebrate, which is a local custom. The police don't interfere. Following the fire is the Taiping Qingjiao festival, carrying Bodhisattvas on the road. The old embellishments of the new city also form a beautiful contrast.</p>
<p>Electric fans can be used, with electricity costing 30 cents per unit. As usual, the three tenants pay for it themselves. The meter runs particularly fast. In one summer, the electricity bill can cost twenty dollars. People in Shanghai won't believe it, but that's the fact.</p>
<p>The prices of Liangfen and melons carried by street vendors are not expensive, but there are many flies. It doesn't matter if Chinese people eat some flies. Nanchang has plenty of hospitals.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 17: Do not ask about the daughter's difficult to say hidden pain, compete to see the sale of people's faces, admire high moral character together</p>
<p>This slogan has been posted inside and outside the Little Western Paradise Hotel for a day, and with the embellishment of mythology, it has finally achieved the desired effect. Many people want to see Commissioner Lan, and therefore many people want to know Zhang Jiefu. Since he welcomes people in a personal capacity, he must have some status, otherwise, it is not worth doing this kind of thing. So, while everyone wants to meet Commissioner Lan, they are also willing to meet this Mr. Zhang Jiefu. However, Jiefu himself is unaware that the atmosphere in the entire hotel is so tense. That night, he prepared two dollars, waiting quietly for Miss Yang Huanhua to come and take it. He thought that in Yang Huanhua's situation, getting one more dime would be of assistance, so she would definitely come. Unexpectedly, he waited until one o'clock in the morning and still did not see the woman's shadow. He thought that she had been flirting with Cheng Zhiqian during the day, and perhaps the Cheng family had paid more, so she had gone to Cheng Zhiqian's room. He was a little unconvinced, so he quietly walked out of the room and stood outside Zhiqian's room, listening quietly for a long time. Unexpectedly, there was only Zhiqian's snoring inside, and no other sounds. But even though there were no sounds, he still couldn't relax, and when he returned to his room, he couldn't sleep peacefully all night. The two silver dollars he had prepared were in his small pocket, and because he couldn't sleep, he tossed and turned on the bed. As a result, the two dollars in the small pocket made a clanging sound and rolled out. This startled Zhang Jiefu. It wouldn't matter if she didn't come, this was a good thing, saving two dollars. These two dollars could be used for something else tomorrow, so he felt at ease and fell asleep. (293)</p>
<h3>Fragrant Clouds Drifting</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>According to the customs of ordinary families, a widowed woman should not use any more cosmetics, but we are playing with cosmetics every day, isn't that very impious? But this is not an example I created, the old ancestors of the previous generations have already done this, especially the clothes we wear in such a position are often very bright; if the colors of the clothes are very bright, we can't let our appearance remain grayish-brown, because if the color of the face and the color of the clothes are too mismatched, it is really very ugly. That's why we have to dress up!</p>
<p>"Let's talk about the powder we use now: its raw material is actually the same as ordinary powder, it is made by grinding rice into fine powder and adding some lead, and when you look at the surface, its color is even yellower than ordinary powder, but in reality, there is a big difference. First, the selection of raw materials is very fine, not only one kind of rice is used; in addition to the newly launched white rice, old rice that has turned slightly purple must also be used, so the powder can be particularly soft. Second, the grinding process is by no means as casual as outside, after the new rice and old rice are cleaned, they must be ground five or six times with millstones of different sizes; first, grind in a rougher stone mill, after grinding clean, sift it finely, and then pour it into a finer stone mill to grind again, after grinding, sift it again, this work of grinding and sifting, sifting and grinding is all done by several experienced old eunuchs, it can be said that they are not sloppy at all. After these two different rice powders are finely ground, they must be mixed together, and there is a certain amount of mixing, not too much or too little, otherwise the color will be greatly affected.

<p>Miscellaneous Remarks</p>
<h3>Summer Refreshments</h3>
<p>— Bailu</p>
<p>Summer is a good weather for reading, and it is also a season for sleeping. In a quiet green window, light incense, or smoke a mild cigarette, reading the books you love to read. If you are reading Turgenev's novels, it will arouse your passion. If you are reading Andersen's fairy tales, it will lead you into a fantasy world... In short, every book will give you a fresh and different effect. If you are tired of reading, you may as well take a nap, and you may see the old friends and characters in the book in your dreams. When you wake up, silently recite: "Cool stone pillow, bamboo mat bed, tired hands throw away the book, long nap. After sleeping, I smile to myself, and a few sounds of fishing flutes are in the vast waves." You will feel that this poem was written for you.</p>
<p>The past is indeed unbearable to look back on, but sometimes it is very interesting to think about it. I remember when I was a child, every summer was my happiest time. My family had a small courtyard, which was not big, but the flowers and plants inside were very lush because of my father's diligent watering. There were also several banana trees in the garden, which were more than one person tall, with a rich green color that seemed to drip. Every day, I would always hide under the banana leaves with a few friends to play, tell stories, or knead clay figures on the ground, often getting my hands covered in mud. Once, I picked several banana leaves and spread them on the ground to sleep; I learned this from a painting, which also showed a child sleeping on a banana leaf. I was sleeping sweetly when I suddenly felt someone hit me. I opened my eyes and saw my father standing in front of me with a straight face. I was so scared that I started to cry; my father wanted to hit me again, but fortunately, my mother heard me crying and rushed over, pulling me into her room, while still complaining about my father, saying that he shouldn't hit a child when he was sleeping. I am no longer a child now, and I can no longer see banana trees where I live, but every summer, I will always be reminded of this.</p>
<p>"Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating"! This saying is the most authentic. With food to eat, everything is fine. How can there be robbers and bandits in the world? To be honest, they are also competing for survival. However, they have taken the wrong path, so although they can survive for a while, they will inevitably end up in the court, taking the evidence of death from the hands of the judge, they died for the sake of survival. The greatest tragedy in the world is nothing more than this. Unfortunately, this year what came with summer was: ×× Bank went bankrupt, ×× Bank was liquidated, ×× store closed... adding countless unemployed vagrants out of thin air. Shanghai calls unemployment "breaking the rice bowl". Once the rice bowl is broken, there is no food to eat. If there is no food to eat, the strong will take risks, and the old and weak will have no choice but to commit suicide. No wonder today's newspaper news is full of suicide and robbery cases.</p>
<p>"Summer is dreadful," but those who dread summer are only rickshaw pullers, coolies, farmers, and all the proletarian citizens. As for the masters, madams, young masters and misses, wealthy merchants, and misses, they have ice cream to eat, cars to ride around in, electric fans to cool off, and air-conditioned foreign houses to hide in. If all this equipment is still not satisfactory, they can go to Lushan, Moganshan, Qingdao, those places with beautiful scenery, where there is never summer. They are not afraid of summer, maybe they even warmly welcome the arrival of summer.</p>
<p>Because I thought of the hardships that summer bestows on farmers, I was reminded of an old poem: "Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat dripping onto the soil below. Who knows that the food on the plate, every grain is hard-earned?" I think this is the real farmers' literature, even children of three or four can almost recite it. Compared with the emerging farmers' literature, it is obviously more valuable. I think that although the poem is old, its meaning is always new.</p>

<h3>National Games Venue Construction Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>The National Games of this year is scheduled to be held in this city on National Day, and it is now only a month away from the Games. The new venue built in the central district of the city is thought to be of interest to the general public. The reporter from the Central News Agency went to visit the construction yesterday to understand the progress of the project, and the details are as follows.</p>
<p>Main Traffic Roads Have Been Widened</p>
<p>During the National Games, there are two necessary traffic routes for citizens to visit the venue: one is from Hongkou Park via West Sports Association Road and Xiangyin Road, and the other is from Disweilu Road via Qimei Road to the venue. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, in order to prevent congestion at that time, has widened the western section of Xiangyin Road. Currently, the entire project has been completed, which is an important facility for traffic during the Games.</p>
<p>Construction Inside the Track and Field Venue Nearing Completion</p>
<p>The grandstands of over twenty tiers and the east and west gates of the track and field venue have been completed. The exterior is connected by red brick arched gates, while the interior grandstands are purely made of steel pipe concrete, with beautiful lines and comfortable seats. Several dozens of workers are currently laying turf in the venue, but three-fifths of it is still land. It is estimated that the turf can be laid within a week. The foundation of the runway has been built, and the 200-meter runways along the east and west sides are being rolled with crushed bricks by road rollers, and some have been paved with coal ash. The temporary shops under the grandstands have not yet been separated. The electric lights have been installed.</p>
<p>Swimming Pool and Gymnasium Completed</p>
<p>The swimming pool and gymnasium have been completed. The swimming pool has been filled with water, but they are all closed, so it was not possible to enter and visit. Currently, about 200 workers are engaged in the construction of the sewer, and the construction and tidying of the roads and parking lots near the venue. It is expected that it will be completed by mid-next month.</p>

<h3>Rotary Cup International Tennis: China Wins Over Japan, Securing Finals Spot; Lin Baohua and Zhang Dingzhao Win Two Singles Matches; British and American Players Each Win a Singles Match, Outcome Undecided; Carson Struggles Through Five Sets, Almost Losing to De Foe</h3>
<p>This year's Shanghai Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament held its semi-finals yesterday afternoon at the Shanghai Tennis Club. China faced Japan, and Britain faced America. The former was a one-sided affair, while the latter was evenly matched. Yesterday's results showed that China has already won two singles matches, securing a spot in the finals (this year only features two singles matches and one doubles match). Britain and America each won one match, leaving the doubles match to decide the final qualification. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>American Side in a Disadvantageous Position</p>
<p>Yesterday's audience was not large, with only two to three hundred people. The Shanghai Club's arrangement was simple and affected the appearance, and the uneven ground made the players dissatisfied. The Japanese players, Ohno and Suto, were ordinary characters, unable to withstand the head-on attacks of China's Lin Baohua and Zhang Dingzhao. Britain fielded the famous players De Foe and Bunninverich, while America had Carson and Squia. The key to victory for either side lay in the Bunninverich and Squia pairing. Ideally, De Foe would lose to Carson, and the skills of Squia and Bunninverich were similar, making it impossible to predict the outcome. If Squia could seize the right opportunity, he would have a good chance of winning. However, yesterday's situation was completely different, with no certainty, and Squia was defeated by Bunninverich. As for the British-American doubles, it is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. America's chances are probably grim. In the Sino-Japanese doubles, Japan has declared its withdrawal and will no longer compete.</p>
<p>China Eliminates Japan</p>
<p>Zhang Dingzhao Wins Over Ohno</p>
<p>Zhang Dingzhao and Ohno began their match at 3 p.m. Zhang has a great intellect for exploration, so his tennis skills progressed rapidly, and everyone admires him. Although his posture is not beautiful, his technique is very reliable. His forehand and backhand strokes are steady and agile. Ohno was no match for him, but very resilient. The result was a straight-set victory, but the competition was quite durable. Ohno's long shots were not enough, and he tried to attack the net, but could not withstand Zhang Dingzhao's left and right sweeps. Unable to resist, Zhang displayed his proficient and experienced hitting skills, winning much applause.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua Wins Over Suto</p>
<p>The second Sino-Japanese match was Lin Baohua against Suto. From beginning to end, Suto was at Lin Baohua's mercy, allowing Lin to dictate the game, running left and right without a moment's rest. Lin, seeing his opponent's lack of support, played even more steadily. His left and right-hand strokes and slices were perfectly placed over the net, beautiful and pleasing to the eye. Lin won eleven consecutive games before Suto finally won a game. In the three sets, Suto only won two games, which was already difficult.</p>
<p>Britain and America Evenly Matched</p>
<p>Squia Loses to Bunninverich</p>
<p>The first match between America and Britain was Squia against Bunninverich, starting at 3 p.m. It was thought that there would be a fierce battle, but Squia was listless, and his shots repeatedly landed in the net, allowing his opponent to win easily without deep thought. However, Bunninverich's hitting skills were also quite good, with left and right exchanges hitting the right spot. Squia's self-abandonment made the victory very easy.</p>
<p>Carson Struggles Through Five Sets, Wins Over De Foe</p>
<p>Carson against De Foe can be said to be the most exciting program of this year's Rotary Cup. The two had never played each other before, and their strength was unpredictable. However, based on usual individual observations and criticism, Carson was above De Foe. Therefore, yesterday's encounter was watched with bated breath.</p>
<p>The two went through a grueling five-set battle before a winner was decided. Although Carson won, he felt it was a great effort. De Foe was as strong as ever, and his agile and crisp hitting made Carson very embarrassed. Unfortunately, his endurance was insufficient to withstand a long battle. Carson's performance was abnormal, and his ball control was not under his command, frequently touching the net, almost losing to De Foe. In the first set, Carson's poor performance was like that of an unknown amateur. De Foe won very easily with a reliable hitting technique, 6-2. After 4-4 in the second set, De Foe made several unforced errors, allowing Carson to win. The third set was the most intense and the most exciting performance. After Carson was defeated, Carson failed to perform well in the second set, losing 2-6. In the final set, Carson relied on his strong physique and remained unchanged. De Foe was exhausted and unable to support himself. Carson won the final victory with 6-1.</p>
<p>British-American Doubles Scheduled for Wednesday</p>
<p>The British-American doubles will be held at the Shanghai Club on Wednesday. Britain will field De Foe and Bunninverich, and America will still consist of Carson and Squia. Britain has a stronger chance of winning.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Co-education in Beiping to be Resolved: Mediators Propose a Compromise Solution</h3>
<p>(Beiping Special Dispatch) The Beiping Municipal Government's ban on co-education in private secondary schools has led to extreme opinions on both sides of the Municipal Authorities and the Private Secondary School Federation. Now that the summer vacation is coming to an end and the start of school is approaching, this problem has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. Because the parties in favor of change have different opinions and disagreements, many female students in private secondary schools are hesitant to register. In this regard, the reporter has specially inquired with the parties concerned to find out the truth. According to the latest situation, both parties are prioritizing the academic studies of students and cannot delay for a long time. Now a mediator has come forward to mediate, and the future looks optimistic. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Compromise Solution</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the matter, the opinions held by both the Municipal Authorities and the Private Secondary School Federation are extreme, like riding a tiger. However, due to time constraints and facts, a solution must be urgently sought. Recently, through the mediation of two persons, a compromise solution has been proposed. The content is that private secondary schools must enroll female students in separate classes or separate schools in the future. Existing co-educational classes can be closed gradually over the years. It is reported that both parties have agreed to this plan.</p>
<p>Private School Attitude</p>
<p>According to news from the Private Secondary School Federation, rumors that the Federation will send representatives south to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Minister of Education Wang Shijie to request that the Beiping Municipal Authorities stop banning co-education in private secondary schools are inconsistent with the facts. Guo Dengao, a member of the Federation who is currently in Nanjing, only asked him to request a copy of the telegram sent to the Beiping Municipal Authorities from the Ministry of Education. As for the rumors that the Federation has filed a complaint against Mayor Yuan Liang, the source is unknown and it is purely fictitious.</p>
<p>Parents' Meeting</p>
<p>Since the co-education of the male and female schools belonging to the Private Secondary School Federation is of great concern to all female students, the Federation has decided on countermeasures after discussion and has announced them in newspapers, hoping that female students will not feel that they will lose their schooling. Fearing that the parents of female students in various schools still do not understand the truth, a parents' meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on the 15th to report on everything.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Border Education Funds: To be Decided at This Week's Executive Yuan Meeting: Eight Provinces Including Shaanxi and Gansu to Receive Subsidies</h3>

<h3>City Education Bureau Sends Zhou Shang to Inspect Hygiene Education in Europe and America - First to America, then Europe Next Winter - Colleagues from the City Education Bureau Give Him a Fond Farewell Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of this city, and Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Education Bureau, both attach great importance to children's health. Last year, they sent Zhou Shang, a specialist from the Education Bureau and concurrently the Director of Experimental Research, to Japan for inspection. This autumn, they have again sent Zhou Shang to Europe and America to inspect hygiene education. Zhou Shang is from Kunshan and graduated from Great China University. He initially served as the principal of the Municipal Jingye Middle School in this city, and later joined the Education Bureau as a lecturer at the Great China Education Institute for over eight years. The advancement of hygiene education in this city, such as health camps, holiday health activities fairs, health experimental schools, tuberculosis sanatorium classes, and health center plans, as well as teacher health, are mostly the result of Zhou Shang's efforts. He usually enjoys buying and reading books and has authored works such as "Hygiene Education in Kindergartens," "Experiments in Chinese Hygiene Education," and "Hygiene Textbooks for Junior High Schools," published by the Commercial Press. Recently, Mr. Wang Yunwu also commissioned him to compile and translate new books abroad. Zhou Shang recently went to Beijing to meet with officials from the Ministry of Education and the Department of Health to seek instructions on matters of attention regarding hygiene education in our country. He has now returned to Shanghai and is scheduled to depart on the 20th of this month on the President Jackson, first to America, and then to Europe next winter. It is expected that he will make a great contribution upon his return to the country. Colleagues from the City Education Bureau held a farewell luncheon for Zhou Shang yesterday at the Sixinglou Restaurant on Fourth Avenue. Over forty people attended, and the event ended with great joy. Attached above is a portrait of Zhou Shang.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (19)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of America, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Therefore, Little Bridge was moved to Mei Village. He loved life there, and Meg, Joan, and his grandfather all felt that they had made the right decision and were deeply gratified. Associating with other boys made his practical abilities gradually emerge, boosted his spirits, and brushed away the useless, beautiful cobwebs that tended to form in his little brain. Naturally, when he came home, he inevitably startled his mother, because he slammed the doors and swore, wanting a pair of big, thick boots "just like Daddy's." However, Joan was actually pleased with him, laughed when she heard those strong words, bought him the boots, and said calmly, "That's how he is; let him go. I want my son to become a manly man. His occasional rudeness won't hurt him. We can gradually make him refined. As for learning, he will pick it up everywhere, like a pigeon picking beans. So don't push him."</p>
<p>Little Mei was always bright and lovely, becoming increasingly charming and gentle, like a budding flower. Because she was like her gentle mother and loved small household chores. She had a family of dolls, and her methods of raising them were a model for mothers. She had to have her little work basket at hand to feel secure and sewed so well that Little Bridge couldn't help but often pull out his handkerchief to show off her fine stitches. Little Ju Sui even had a small flannel vest made by Little Mei's skillful hands. She liked to rummage through the china cabinet, preparing salt dishes, and neatly placing spoons on the table. She went around the living room every day, dusting the tables and chairs. Little Bridge called her "busybody," but he was also happy to have her organize his things, help with various tasks with her nimble fingers, and help with his homework. The two of them always progressed together in their studies, without any desire to compete.</p>

<h3>Medical Popularization and the Public Medical System (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Due to the various reasons mentioned above, relying on a small number of private doctors providing free consultations to promote medical care among the lower classes and to achieve medical popularization is simply impossible and unworkable. In fact, whether all practicing physicians are willing to pay attention to this, each show compassion, and each can spare some time to do free consultation work is still a big question. Even if we take a step back and assume it can be done, it would only be limited to the middle classes, while the lower classes, who are the most numerous and live the hardest lives, would still not be able to benefit at all. To be more specific, in the social environment of Shanghai, free consultations can at most provide some slight benefits to a portion of the middle class who earn thirty to fifty yuan per month. However, they provide no benefit to the lower-class working class who earn less than ten or eight yuan per month.</p>
<p>Then, what method can truly popularize medical care, so that not only the middle class can enjoy the benefits of medical care, but also the propertyless masses, who are the most numerous and live the hardest lives, can enjoy medical welfare and achieve the ideal goal of "medical popularization"? I believe that we cannot rely on free consultations from private doctors. We need the government's power to systematically implement a public medical system to solve this problem.</p>
<p>It seems that some people have mentioned this public medical system before. However, to truly bring medical care to the people, we can only adopt this public medical system. To fundamentally solve the problem of medical popularization and universalization, we can only adopt the public medical system.</p>
<p>As for the great undertaking of establishing this public medical system, it must be led and promoted by the state to have the hope of real effectiveness and the possibility of success. Firstly, the state has the authority and ability to establish this public medical system. Secondly, the state also has the due obligation to solve the medical problems of the entire population. This obligation is just like the people's obligation to pay taxes to the state.</p>
<p>If it is not run by the state but only by a small number of private individuals or public organizations in a scattered manner, firstly, due to economic constraints, it is difficult to sustain, and there is often the problem of starting strong and finishing weak. Secondly, due to the lack of a systematic unified plan, it is difficult to run it perfectly. Thirdly, private individuals or public organizations, etc., have no fixed obligation to this undertaking and can do it or not according to their interests. If it is led by the state and run by the government, these drawbacks can be avoided. At the same time, private individuals and public organizations with the ability and financial resources can still assist the government and help promote it, which will naturally achieve great results.</p>
<p>This public medical system, led and run by the state, is the fundamental solution to "medical popularization."</p>
<p>However, this plan depends on the interest of government personnel, and the implementation of this undertaking depends on the financial resources of the government authorities. Therefore, when it comes to implementation, regardless of the objective social environment and the urgent need for medical care among the people who are suffering from illness and poverty, in the current situation of the people being poor and the country being financially exhausted, turning ideals into reality is inevitably a matter of "easier said than done"!</p>
<h3>Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>Medical Story No. 7</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most common lung disease. The treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis focuses on the observation of initial symptoms. When tubercle bacilli invade any part of the body—mostly the lungs, bones and joints, lymph nodes, kidneys, and the base of the meninges, etc.—the tissue in that part undergoes a special reaction. This reaction is defensive in nature, aiming to engulf and destroy the invading tubercle bacilli. The result of the reaction is a change in the tissue. To the naked eye, this is manifested as small, grayish-white spots on the tissue. Under a microscope, we can see that it is a larger central cell, formed by the aggregation of many cells, surrounded by a ring of white blood cells. The larger central cell has engulfed the tubercle bacilli and is killing them. Usually, it is successful.</p>
<p>Anyone can accidentally contract pulmonary tuberculosis. However, among those who contract pulmonary tuberculosis, nine out of ten will unknowingly eliminate the invading tubercle bacilli. Sometimes, the tubercle bacilli get a chance to grow, and the affected tissue begins to decay. In the lungs, at this stage, a second disease often occurs, which is: other germs invade the soft parts of the lungs, causing the damage to expand.</p>
<p>Osler's analogy of pulmonary tuberculosis infection to sowing seeds is quite appropriate. He said: When sowing seeds, some seeds fall on stony ground, some are pecked away by birds, and some fall among weeds and are hindered by them. In terms of tubercle bacillus infection, most of us are like stony ground, making it impossible for them to settle down. In some people, blood cells are like birds: they clear away the germs. In other people, the defensive reactions of the body tissue are like weeds to seeds, preventing the germs from growing. But in a small number of people, the invading tubercle bacilli find a favorable environment to grow and multiply.</p>
<p>The most suitable observer for the initial symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis is the patient himself. Several years ago, in the Atlantic Monthly, there was an article titled "Confessions of a T.B." The author was a history professor at a university in the United States. In this article, the author described his experiences with pulmonary tuberculosis. His initial symptom was a kind of "unbearable fatigue." This fatigue was different from ordinary "nervous" or "physical" fatigue. Even when resting, he felt a kind of "physical burden." Every afternoon, he lay in bed, and every muscle fiber in his body seemed to be individually crying out its fatigue. The initial symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis patients are like this. Later, he started coughing. Later still, he started coughing up phlegm. Young people should pay attention to examination if they experience gradual weight loss.</p>
<p>The most important method of examination is to measure body temperature four times a day—at 8 a.m., 12 p.m., 4 p.m., and 8 p.m. When pulmonary tuberculosis initially occurs, the body temperature is lower than normal in the morning; in the afternoon, it rises to 99 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and then returns to the original temperature in the evening. As the disease progresses, the daily temperature changes gradually increase. In addition to measuring body temperature, examining the chest, checking saliva, and using X-rays are also indispensable procedures.</p>
<p>As for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, relying on doctors alone is not enough. The first thing that patients and their families think of is a suitable climate. This is an economic matter. But climate is not the main condition; if other main conditions are abandoned for the sake of climate, it would be a major mistake. Dr. Logan Clendening, the author of "The Human Body," once compared the opinions of laymen and doctors on the various conditions for treating pulmonary tuberculosis in a table as follows:</p>
<p>Layman's Opinion:</p>
<p>First: Climate</p>
<p>Second: Blood Plasma</p>
<p>Third: Horseback Riding</p>
<p>Fourth: Gold-containing Medicine</p>
<p>Fifth: Milk and Cheese</p>
<p>Doctor's Opinion:</p>
<p>First: Rest</p>
<p>Second: Fresh Air</p>
<p>Third: Extra Food</p>
<p>Fourth: Surgery</p>
<p>Fifth: Mental Encouragement</p>
<p>Sixth: Climate</p>
<p>The use of surgery to treat pulmonary tuberculosis began in 1910, and its significance is to remove the decayed part to prevent it from spreading. Currently, doctors will not use this method unless as a last resort. As for the use of fresh air to treat pulmonary tuberculosis, it was invented by George Boddingtong in 1845. When he first published this invention, he was opposed by the general medical community and even had his job terminated.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Question and Answer About Disease</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(Sixty-Four) Acute Generalized Peritonitis</p>
<p>Question: What is acute generalized peritonitis?</p>
<p>Answer: This is a disease caused by various bacteria (streptococcus, staphylococcus, pneumococcus, E. coli, typhoid bacillus, gonococcus, etc.) invading the peritoneum and causing inflammation throughout. Perforation or suppuration occurs on the peritoneum, or septicemia occurs throughout the body.</p>
<p>Question: What are the symptoms of acute generalized peritonitis?</p>
<p>Answer: It can be divided into local and systemic symptoms.</p>
<p>Question: What are the local symptoms?</p>
<p>Answer: The main local symptom is abdominal pain, especially in the case of perforating peritonitis, which is more sudden and severe. When the abdomen is pressed, the patient complains of extreme pain.</p>
<p>Question: What is the external appearance of the patient's abdomen?</p>
<p>Answer: Initially, the abdominal wall shows localized tension, and then the entire abdomen becomes evenly tense, like a board.</p>
<p>Question: What symptoms appear in the patient's gastrointestinal tract?</p>
<p>Answer: Belching, vomiting, and hiccups occur. There is flatulence in the intestines, especially in the case of perforating peritonitis, which is more severe. The abdomen is highly distended. Percussion reveals that the boundaries of liver and spleen dullness disappear due to abdominal distension.</p>
<p>Question: What is the condition of the patient's bowel movements and urination?</p>
<p>Answer: Bowel movements are mostly constipated; but in puerperal and septic peritonitis, diarrhea occurs instead. Urination is frequent and urgent, and the patient complains of pain when urinating. Urine volume is reduced.</p>
<p>Question: What are the systemic symptoms?</p>
<p>Answer: The body temperature mostly rises to a moderate degree. However, there are also cases of remitting fever or even no fever. Also, in the case of puerperal and septic peritonitis, there is usually chills and shivering accompanied by high fever (above 40 degrees Celsius). Afterwards, the fever fluctuates and becomes consumptive.</p>
<p>Question: What are the pulse and respiration like?</p>
<p>Answer: The pulse is rapid, reaching 120 to 140 beats per minute, soft and irregular. Respiration is shallow and superficial, mainly thoracic breathing, with 30 to 40 breaths per minute.</p>
<p>Question: What are the appearance and limbs of a patient with acute generalized peritonitis like?</p>
<p>Answer: The appearance is terrified, ashen gray, with sunken eye sockets, falling into collapse. The limbs are cold and sweaty, and the skin is bluish purple.</p>
<p>Question: What is the abnormality of the patient's tongue coating?</p>
<p>Answer: The tongue is dry, covered with a thick coating, and the patient complains of thirst.</p>
<p>Question: What is the state of consciousness?</p>
<p>Answer: Consciousness remains clear throughout, on the contrary, the patient may feel a sense of euphoria.</p>
<p>Question: What is the entire course of this disease like?</p>
<p>Answer: It lasts for three to four days to as long as two weeks. If death is avoided, the intestinal tract may be curved, or there may be incarceration, causing intestinal stenosis, with fecal vomiting. The course is better in those secondary to gonorrhea, pneumonia, and arthritis.</p>
<p>Question: How is the prognosis?</p>
<p>Answer: Death is usually inevitable. Especially in the case of perforating, puerperal, and septic generalized peritonitis, the prognosis is absolutely poor.</p>

<h3>Medical Treatment for Pain (28)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Hand Abscesses</p>
<p>There is an idiom "ten fingers connected to the heart", meaning that injury or abscesses on the hands are extremely painful. Abscesses on the fingers are not only extremely painful but also very dangerous. Here is an example to illustrate: When I was in medical school, there was a student in the class ahead of me who, while interning at the hospital, pricked his finger in the pathology lab, resulting in no more than a drop of blood. He immediately applied iodine for disinfection. He thought that the preventive measures had been implemented and that everything would be fine. Who knew that something unexpected would happen? A day or two later, the area where the finger had been pricked began to swell and become red, and a red line symptom (acute lymphangitis) was also found on the arm. The patient also had chills and fever. Gradually, the lymph nodes under the armpit also became abscessed. After a few more days, the chest cavity on the same side was also filled with pus, and the condition was so severe that it had reached its extreme, and life was truly hopeless. However, because he encountered this difficulty in the Los Angeles Municipal Hospital, famous doctors were unwilling to see him sacrifice himself for medical science. Therefore, it was decided to select a majority of celebrities in the medical community of the entire city to be responsible for the treatment, and private nurses served day and night in three shifts. Internal and external surgeries were performed at the same time. Even for blood transfusions, one treatment was given every few days, for a total of dozens of times. The severe period lasted for several months. He fainted several times and knew that he could not survive. Who knew that science can sometimes overcome fate? After nearly a year of scientific treatment, he finally managed to be reborn. He is still alive today.</p>
<p>This is a special encounter, and not everyone who injures their fingers is so unlucky. However, every time the hand is injured or has sores, it is dangerous. There are probably several outcomes for a finger prick: (1) A local abscess forms. It is painful day and night before it becomes abscessed. Even after the abscess forms, opening it without anesthesia is very painful. Local anesthesia cannot completely eliminate the pain. Although there is some pain with surgery, it should not be avoided. (2) The finger abscess spreads to the entire palm, and the swelling and pain of the entire palm are ten times greater than the finger abscess. If the finger abscess is opened early, it can probably avoid spreading to the palm. (3) In addition to local inflammation, lymphangitis of the arm or abscess of the axillary lymph nodes may occur. (4) As in the example given above.</p>
<p>Before finger and palm abscesses mature, there are several ways to relieve pain and reduce swelling. Use the hot and cold method, such as soaking the hand in hot water for three minutes (gradually adding hot water to the extent that it can be tolerated), followed by soaking it in cold water for half a minute. Do this three times each for hot and cold. Do this several times a day. The effects of hot and cold water are: (1) to reduce the tension of the inflamed area, making it relaxed, thus relieving pain. (2) to increase blood flow, thus having the effect of reducing swelling. In addition to using hot and cold, it is also very important to completely rest the hand (total body rest is even better). Resting the inflamed area is also a method of relieving pain. Secondly, using analgesic lotion or analgesic paste can also have some pain-relieving effects.</p>
<p>Painful Urination</p>
<p>There is now a disease that is advancing rapidly, in all countries, and it is even more widespread in the major cities of our country, which is surprising. What disease is that? It is easy to guess. It is gonorrhea. In Europe and the United States, there are rough statistics that in some countries, more than half of the men in the country have had gonorrhea. Our country has no statistics, and such statistical materials are not easy to obtain. However, the prosperity of venereal disease hospitals in large cities and the advertisements for gonorrhea drugs filling the newspapers show that the poison of venereal disease is unexpectedly widespread. Since this is a hidden disease, the suffering of most patients is also a hidden suffering.</p>
<p>In the acute stage of gonorrhea, the first important symptom is pain when urinating. Now we need to ask why it hurts when urinating? The root cause of the pain is inflammation of the urethra. The second reason is that the composition of the urine is not suitable for the inflamed urethra. Although the fundamental way to relieve pain is to cure the urethral inflammation, it is often not possible to achieve this in a short period of time. However, reducing the pain is easier to do. Here is a brief description of the principle of reducing pain: Now, for example, if you drip some vinegar on any wound, the result will naturally be very painful. Why does it hurt? It is the acid in the vinegar that makes the sore area hurt. Then, ordinary urine is acidic, and the more concentrated the urine, the stronger the acidity. That is, when ordinary urine passes through the inflamed urethra, the acid in the urine stimulates the inflamed area. The stimulation of the inflamed area is what causes pain, and the greater the stimulation, the more unbearable the pain. Now, turning it around, for example, if you soak a broken area of skin in clean water, the stimulation to the wound is very small, and the pain is also very little. If you soak it in baking soda water, the wound is hardly stimulated, so there is no pain. Then, very dilute urine contains the least amount of acid, and the stimulation is also very little when it passes through the inflamed area, so the pain is also very little. If you take mild alkaline drugs internally to turn the urine into a weakly alkaline or neutral, then the pain can be reduced by 99% when it passes through the urethra. In short, drinking more water to dilute the urine, reduce acidity, and combining appropriate alkaline drugs internally is the proper way to stop painful urination.</p>
<p>Sometimes the pain is too severe, and taking painkillers internally is also the proper way. This type of drug calms the nerves, causing the brain's perception of pain to become slow, and as a result, the pain is also reduced. Such drugs as sodium bromide, potassium bromide, hyoscyamine, etc., and any similar drugs can be used properly. When a person with urethral pain is finishing urinating, they must not use constricting force to drain the remaining urine, because constricting hard when urinating can increase pain. If you allow the remaining urine to drip out slowly and naturally when you are finishing urinating, you can avoid a lot of pain.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this article, I have mentioned that the hot and cold water therapy has a not small effect on relieving pain, and it is beneficial and harmless to the body. This is the case for any pain, and it is the same for painful urination. If you have severe painful urination, pouring ice water on the urine or soaking it in extremely cold water can immediately relax the tension and eliminate it completely. Winter is more convenient than summer, so you don't need to use ice water, ordinary cold water is enough. It is also beneficial to add a tranquilizer internally.</p>
<p>If the posterior part of the urethra is acutely inflamed and very painful, the patient can sit in a hot water tank for a few minutes each time, every few hours, and the effect is not small. When entering the water for the first time, the water heat can start from 104 degrees Fahrenheit (hot water), and after entering the water, you can gradually add hot water to the degree that it can be tolerated. Secondly, washing the rectum with hot water is also very beneficial, because the rectum is very close to the inflamed part of the posterior urethra.</p>
<p>In addition to using heat, using cold also has considerable benefits. If the painful urination flares up, pouring ice water on the urine or soaking it in extremely cold water can immediately relax the tension and eliminate it completely. Winter is more convenient than summer, so you don't need to use ice water, ordinary cold water is enough. It is also beneficial to add a tranquilizer internally.</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(60) Dacryocystitis</p>
<p>Dacryocystitis is also known as chronic catarrhal dacryocystitis. Generally, people only know to think of it as being related to eye diseases. Because the main symptom of this disease is tearing. And tearing is a common symptom of ordinary eye diseases. Therefore, it is no wonder that patients often mistake it for an eye disease. In fact, in addition to tearing, this disease also causes a bulge to occur in the inner canthus of the lower eyelid. Sometimes, the skin of that area appears reddish. If pressure is applied to that area with a finger, a purulent, mucous, or serous liquid will flow out. These are a few points we should pay attention to. These points also provide great assistance in diagnosis. The main cause of this disease is the blockage of the nasolacrimal duct. As for the reasons for the blockage of the nasolacrimal duct, it is probably due to the narrowing of the nasolacrimal duct. The causes of narrowing include (1) atrophic rhinitis, (2) adenopathy, syphilis, lupus, and leprosy, (3) osteomyelitis, (4) nasal polyps, (5) syphilitic periostitis, (6) adenopathic periostitis, (7) fractures, and (8) tumors, etc. Sometimes, it can occur for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>The course of this disease is mostly chronic. Sometimes, because the lacrimal sac wall is often filled with fluid, it loses its elasticity, resulting in lacrimal sac atony. Sometimes, because the expansion of the lacrimal sac wall increases, it presents a cyst-like appearance, either bulging forward or expanding backward, compressing the eyeball. This can be called lacrimal hydrops. Sometimes, the suppuration of the lacrimal sac causes damage to the sac wall and skin, often leaving a lacrimal fistula. At this time, the patient often suffers from tearing (which is even more severe with wind, smoke, dust, etc.). Sometimes, it can cause chronic conjunctivitis, blepharitis, eczema, and ectropion of the lower eyelid. Sometimes, it can even cause corneal ulceration or purulent ophthalmia, leading to blindness.</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment plan for this disease, first, the cause of the nasolacrimal duct obstruction should be investigated. Second, efforts should be made to eliminate the narrowing of the nasolacrimal duct. Third, the fluid retained in the lacrimal sac should be drained. Fourth, the lacrimal sac should be cleaned using the washing method. However, these four treatment plans should, of course, be carried out by an ophthalmologist.</p>
<h3>Popular Lectures on Modern Venereology (14)</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengzi (Compiled and Narrated), Yin Muqiang (Proofread)</p>
<p>Part Two: Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Local treatment is a method of directly applying medicinal solutions to the affected mucous membranes. This is the most rational and main method of treatment. Here, we should pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>A. Conditions for Using Local Treatments for Gonorrhea</p>
<p>The use of treatments for gonorrhea must meet various conditions, as advocated by Neisser early on:</p>
<p>a. It must have a strong bactericidal ability against gonococci, but it must not damage tissues.</p>
<p>b. It should not be irritating to the mucous membrane or increase inflammation.</p>
<p>c. It must have an effect that reaches deep into the submucosal tissue, but it must not coagulate salt and protein, thereby hindering healing.</p>
<p>To ensure that the treatment for gonorrhea has a deep-reaching effect, it must first not combine with tissue fluid, thereby avoiding reducing its effect. This has already been mentioned when discussing the general properties of gonococci against drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to administer the treatment for gonorrhea in a way that prevents it from combining with salt or protein. For example, substances like mercuric chloride and silver nitrate that combine with tissue not only reduce their medicinal effect but also produce precipitates at that location, blocking the path to deeper penetration. However, on the other hand, when there are precipitates, they can prevent the reproduction of gonococci. Furthermore, when the precipitates dissolve again, there is still a temporary bactericidal effect. However, weighing the gains and losses, the application of this agent to gonorrhea cannot be considered a completely satisfactory effect.</p>
<p>B. Precautions for Use</p>
<p>During the acute phase, internal medicine and anti-inflammatory methods should be used first to reduce the symptoms, and then local treatment should be used. This is of utmost importance. Because an unwise local treatment, although it can reduce and kill bacteria and toxins for a time, can damage the mucous membrane and reduce its natural resistance, leaving regrets.</p>
<p>Local treatment includes three methods: injection, washing, and Janet's instillation method. Applying treatment according to the condition will not cause any drawbacks. However, many patients often perform the procedure themselves, resulting in anterior urethritis developing into posterior urethritis or other lesions. This is frequently seen and should also be noted.</p>
<p>The above is only general treatment knowledge. As for the administration of other effective agents and treatment techniques, etc., these are matters for specialist physicians, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Diagnosis and Prevention of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>The diagnosis of gonorrhea can generally be made based on past history and general symptoms. However, the identification of specific pathogens in secretions or pus is even more reliable. In addition, in chronic gonorrhea with few secretions and mild symptoms, diagnosis is more difficult. Furthermore, it is also difficult to determine the location of the lesion. This requires specialized knowledge.</p>
<p>The prevention of gonorrhea is very similar to the prevention of syphilis. Here is a summary of several important items for personal prevention:</p>
<p>A. Stay away from improper social venues, such as brothels, gambling houses, taverns, etc. Many people who are fond of lust and pleasure gather in these places, and the chance of infection is extremely high.</p>
<p>B. Absolutely prohibit unclean sexual intercourse. Those who have engaged in it should urinate immediately after intercourse and wash and apply disinfectant water or ointment to the genitals. Other factors such as sexual intercourse after heavy drinking, interrupted sexual intercourse, and prolonged retention of the penis in the vagina after ejaculation are all inducements to infection and should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>C. Men with phimosis are prone to infection due to the accumulation of dirt. Therefore, circumcision should be performed early.</p>
<p>D. Bathroom utensils, towels in public places, and items in toilets are all indirect routes of transmission for this disease and must also be noted.</p>
<p>Part Three: Chancroid</p>
<p>Chapter 1: About Chancroid</p>
<p>According to a clinical report in our country, chancroid (Ulcus molle) is quite widespread. As for past history, there is no definite evidence in old medical books, so it is omitted.</p>
<p>Chancroid is a venereal ulcer caused by its own specific pathogen. The invasion of this pathogen causes lesions to occur locally, but it does not cause systemic symptoms. This is different from syphilis and gonorrhea, which can spread to various parts of the body.</p>
<p>A. Pathogen</p>
<p>The pathogen of chancroid was discovered by the Italian Ducrey in 1889 and is known to be a small bacillus, approximately 1.5U long and approximately 0.4U wide, with slightly blunt and rounded ends and slightly narrower in the middle. It exists singly or in clusters inside or outside pus cells. Those in the tissues exhibit a unique chain-like shape.</p>
<p>B. Symptoms, Location, and Course</p>
<p>Chancroid is mainly caused by the invasion of pathogens into small damaged areas of the skin or mucous membranes due to unclean sexual intercourse. The incubation period for the onset of this disease is very short or even non-existent. At the beginning of the disease, only shedding of the epidermis is seen, and significant symptoms are only seen after two or three days. Therefore, we can confirm that the onset of chancroid usually occurs within one week. If it occurs after one week, careful consideration is necessary when diagnosing. The symptoms at the onset of this disease begin with red papules, which then suppurate, forming a characteristic ulcer, characterized by (1) irregular edges, serrated or rodent-gnawed, burrowing under the skin, (2) a clear red halo around it, (3) a large amount of pus discharged, (4) a bright red granular surface, (5) when pus adheres to other parts, it can self-inoculate and regenerate new ulcers, or grow from small to large, forming large ulcers, or spread linearly and serpentinely, or erode deep into the tissue, or form gangrene. The subjective symptoms include a burning sensation and pain at the beginning (especially when rubbed or pulled). Other symptoms such as body temperature and general condition are usually normal in pure chancroid.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (64)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(3) Tuberculosis and Asthma</p>
<p>Opinions differ regarding the relationship between tuberculosis and asthma: some consider it very close, while others completely disagree. In fact, examples of the two conditions occurring together are indeed rare. In the chronic form of pulmonary tuberculosis, breathing difficulties often occur when walking or climbing, which can easily lead to misdiagnosis!</p>
<p>(4) Tuberculosis and Malaria</p>
<p>Opinions also differ regarding the prognosis when tuberculosis and malaria occur together. Some believe it tends to worsen, while others believe it leads to recovery. Because cases of both conditions occurring together are very common in tropical areas where malaria is prevalent, but the outcomes are very good, and many are from the poor class with no treatment. Therefore, some pulmonary tuberculosis patients advocate the method of artificially infecting with malaria to facilitate recovery; the results in this area have not yet been unanimously judged.</p>
<p>In addition, we must understand that if pulmonary tuberculosis is in the process of recovery or complete cessation, and other infectious diseases occur, it is very easy for it to relapse. Childhood measles and whooping cough are obvious examples; in addition, colds, pharyngitis, and epidemic colds are very unfavorable to the lungs. Patients with these diseases must have absolute rest in addition to the treatment of the above-mentioned diseases, and prevention of catching a cold should also be carefully noted.</p>
<p>Appendix: Pregnancy and Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Pregnancy in women is originally a very ordinary thing, but if it is discovered in women with pulmonary tuberculosis, it will immediately attract serious attention. It is harmful to tuberculosis (especially pulmonary tuberculosis) and has no benefits. Latent tuberculosis can become progressive, resulting in miscarriage or premature birth; therefore, it is not unreasonable to regard pregnancy as a complication of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>So, what should we do when we find that a woman with pulmonary tuberculosis is pregnant? People with a little medical common sense all know that an induced abortion is sometimes unavoidable. But whether this operation should be performed or not must be decided by the doctor after several careful considerations and cannot be rashly carried out. We should know the true state of the disease in detail. Is it progressive? Latent? Or in a recovered state? If it is in a recovered state or below, the impact is relatively small; latent tuberculosis is very likely to become progressive; both of these should be diagnosed after a long period of observation. If the progressive symptoms are already obvious, and tubercle bacilli can also be seen in the sputum, then an induced abortion should be performed; the sooner the better, preferably in the first month of pregnancy, and at the latest within four months. After four months, be cautious unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Laryngeal tuberculosis is a very serious disease, and the above-mentioned operation is also imperative, but if it is in the late stages of pregnancy and the patient has no hope of recovery, then it is better to quietly wait for the end of pregnancy to preserve the life of the child.

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Commercial Bank Investment in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>— Xin Zai</p>
<p>In the past three or four years, due to the sharp decline of rural areas and the stagnation of urban finance, financial circles and those who are rescuing rural areas have advocated that commercial capital be invested in rural areas to regulate the "excess" in cities and the "exhaustion" in rural areas. This is indeed a way out for the financial industry. However, if we further study whether the investment of commercial capital in rural areas can revive rural areas and whether it is a permanent solution, this is indeed a question. I believe that commercial banks undertaking agricultural investment have various benefits on the one hand, but many shortcomings are also found in the nature of their business. Now I will discuss its advantages and disadvantages separately as follows:</p>
<p>A. Advantages</p>
<p>(1) Agricultural investment is inherently large. China has a vast land and so many farmers, so it certainly needs a large amount of agricultural investment. In the current situation where government finances are difficult, it is simply impossible to rely entirely on the government to maintain it. Commercial banks engaging in agricultural lending can indeed make up for this inadequacy of government financial resources.</p>
<p>(2) The fact that rural areas are collapsing is already clear to most people and does not need to be described in detail. The lack of production funds can be asserted. If commercial capital is invested in rural areas, it can make farmers' financial turnover more flexible, improve production, and the living environment of farmers can also be improved as a result.</p>
<p>(3) Since rural areas lack funds, high-interest loans are an inevitable result. The ordinary interest rate is always around 2%, and in the interior, it is mostly above 2%. Commercial banks lend to cooperatives at a common 9%, and cooperatives relend to farmers at about 1.4% to 1.5%, which is at least 5-6% lower than the original interest rate in rural areas. This cannot but be said to be a contribution of the inflow of commercial capital into rural areas.</p>
<p>(4) China's agricultural investment has not yet reached its maximum limit and will definitely not be affected by the law of diminishing returns. According to the inference of general agronomists, if good seeds and more fertilizers are used, the output can be doubled. This estimate cannot be easily believed, but it can be affirmed that my country's agricultural investment has not yet reached its limit. If commercial capital flows in, production can naturally increase.</p>
<p>(5) The entire financial industry, urban and rural areas, is cyclical. Agricultural products are sold, funds flow into rural areas, and farmers buy industrial and commercial goods, funds flow to urban areas. In this way, industrial and commercial finance and urban finance form a simple cycle system. They must be consistently integrated and then can progress together. Therefore, the investment of commercial capital in rural areas is not only reviving agriculture but also becoming a preparation for developing industry and commerce.</p>
<p>B. Disadvantages</p>
<p>(1) To speak frankly, the ultimate goal of commercial capital investment in rural areas is not to rescue rural areas but to obtain some interest. Therefore, whether the loans are secure and whether farmers can pay interest on time are their prerequisite issues. In this way, those who can borrow loans are invisibly limited to self-cultivating farmers with farmland. But the facts tell us that those who need financial assistance the most are the semi-self-cultivating farmers and tenant farmers who account for 55%. Therefore, the investment of commercial capital in rural areas is partial, class-based, and cannot be used for universal relief.</p>
<p>(2) Since commercial capital must seek security, there are considerable restrictions on the amount of loans. The amount of loans is not based on the purpose but is determined by the value of the collateral, the credit of the borrower, and the assets. This naturally has an undeniable error. We know that the purpose of farmers borrowing loans must be legitimate, and the amount must be suitable for this purpose so that the borrower can use the whole set. If the loan is not enough to meet his needs, it loses the purpose of the loan and increases the farmer's unnecessary consumption due to being diverted to other uses. For example, if a farmer wants to buy 20 yuan of agricultural tools, but because of insufficient credit and collateral, he can only borrow 15 yuan. He cannot buy these agricultural tools, so he disperses the 15 yuan and diverts it, increasing his non-urgent consumption. This is a very common fact. Therefore, the amount of the loan is best determined according to its legitimate purpose and cannot be based solely on collateral and credit as the only standard. As commercial banks seek security, this point is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>(3) The term of agricultural investment is generally longer than that of industry and commerce because the turnover of agriculture is very slow, and the term of investment is naturally prolonged accordingly. The longest agricultural financial turnover period in the world is in France, where real estate mortgages can reach 75 years, Germany 56 years, Italy 50 years, and the Industrial Bank of Japan also has long-term loans of 50 years. The US Federal Land Bank has 40 years. From these figures, we know that agricultural investment does need to be long-term. But this point is too contrary to the lending of commercial banks. Their mission is to circulate in the financial market, so naturally, the term of agricultural investment cannot be too long. What I know is that they are all within one year, with eight months being the most common. This kind of lending that cannot meet the time needs of farmers is also a defect of commercial capital.</p>
<p>(4) The investment of commercial capital in rural areas can indeed lower the current high-interest rate, as mentioned earlier, but I believe that the level of this loan interest rate cannot only be compared with the original interest rate in the local area but should be compared with the interest rate of agriculture itself. If it cannot be lower than the interest rate of agricultural investment, then it is not a fundamental solution. According to the survey by the College of Agriculture of Jinling University (see Buck: Chinese Farm Economy), the average interest rate obtained from farm investment is only 9.4%. This is the material from 1925. Until this year, the double destruction of natural and man-made disasters has lasted for ten years. I think the current interest rate for investing in agriculture must be less than 9.4%. The interest rate obtained by farmers from commercial loans is actually 1.4-5%. Investing in agriculture with a 1.5% loan and getting a 9.4% interest rate, the farmer still has to lose 5%. If this continues, rural areas will also be in danger of declining. Therefore, the investment of commercial capital in rural areas has a fundamental problem in theory and is by no means a thorough solution to rescue rural areas.</p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of commercial capital investment in rural areas can be seen clearly. Our conclusion is this: In today's situation where government finances are difficult and unable to invest in agriculture, it is possible for commercial banks to temporarily make up for the lack of government power. If we want to seek thorough and fundamental relief for rural areas, then we cannot expect commercial banks. The government should plan for agricultural banks within its financial capabilities and implement reasonable agricultural lending. I hope that the government, especially those who are fascinated by commercial capital to rescue rural areas, will pay close attention to this under the high tide of banks handling agricultural loans.</p>
<h3>Review of the U.S. Policy of Raising Silver Prices</h3>
<p>— Pan Wenan</p>
<p>Since the United States implemented its silver purchasing policy in December 1933, silver prices have gradually increased. Before March of this year, the price hovered around 54 cents per ounce. However, due to the continued purchases by the U.S. Treasury, eager demand from speculators, and China's ban on silver exports, the supply became scarce and the demand high. This led to a sharp rise in mid-March. By April 10, the global silver price was almost on par with the U.S. domestic price of 64.64 cents per ounce for newly mined silver. Consequently, the U.S. President took the initiative to raise the domestic silver price to 71 cents per ounce, attracting significant global attention. The global silver price followed suit, with spot transactions surging to 69.5 cents and futures exceeding 71 cents. Speculators worldwide perceived this move as solid proof of the U.S. determination to fully implement the Silver Purchase Act. Observing the rise in market silver prices nearing the purchase price, the President announced a second increase on April 24, raising the silver price to 77.57 cents per ounce, and the market price correspondingly rose to 81.5 cents per ounce. Subsequently, the President did not implement a third price increase, causing the market price to soften to around 75.56 cents. We should not hastily believe that silver faction congressmen have changed their plan to raise the market price to $1.29 per ounce.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the 16 to 1 Standard</p>
<p>Furthermore, we cannot hope that the silver faction's attempt to raise silver prices will stop here. Considering that since the government reduced the gold content of the gold dollar, the silver faction has sought to reduce the silver content of the silver dollar in a similar manner. The original gold content of the gold dollar was 25.8 grains of pure gold, with a fineness of 90%. Since it was reduced to 15 and 21/5 grains of pure gold, the gold and silver dollar ratio would change from the original 16 to 1 to 27 to 1 if the silver dollar content was not reduced accordingly. This means that 27 ounces of silver would only be equal to 1 ounce of pure gold.</p>
<p>Recently, influential figures in the silver faction have been advocating for the 16 to 1 standard. In April, they vigorously persuaded the Senate Agriculture Committee to support a bill mandating the Treasury to purchase 50 million ounces of silver monthly to achieve a silver-to-gold ratio of 3:1 or a market price of 16:1. If this ratio were enacted into law, the Treasury would inevitably have to purchase silver at the high price of $2.18 per ounce.</p>
<p>Reduced Supply Drives Silver Prices Higher</p>
<p>One significant factor driving the current surge in silver prices is the lack of substantial silver suppliers worldwide, apart from China and India. Even considering the newly mined silver in the United States, the annual production is only slightly above 200 million ounces, which is insufficient for the U.S. government to purchase entirely. A portion must still be used for industrial purposes. China, using silver as its standard, has already issued an order restricting silver exports. Other silver-using countries, witnessing the crisis, will inevitably take similar steps sooner or later, which is foreseeable. If these countries can effectively prohibit the melting of silver coins and the private sale of silver, it will reduce the silver supply and promote higher silver prices. However, taking China as an example, maintaining silver reserves to prevent outflow due to high prices is difficult.</p>
<p>India holds a relatively large amount of silver. Excluding the difficult-to-estimate private hoards, the reserves in the national treasury and the Reserve Bank amount to approximately 310 million ounces. However, India is restricted by the London Silver Agreement and cannot sell more than 35 million ounces of silver annually. Therefore, it has little impact on silver market fluctuations. What warrants our attention is that with the upward trend in the silver market, speculators in India and other countries are hoarding silver and refraining from selling, or even colluding, aggressively purchasing in hopes of further gains, multiplying their profits tenfold. In fact, according to reports from London, Indian speculators are enthusiastically purchasing silver, which is a strong factor driving up silver prices. At this time of global competition for silver, without the United States accumulating massive silver reserves, merely continuing purchases will make it easy for the silver price to reach $1.29 per ounce, or even the 16 to 1 ratio, which would not be surprising.</p>
<p>But what will happen after the silver price reaches its peak? Let us try to explore this. After silver prices stop rising, speculators will rush to sell to make profits. At this time, the only ones who can support silver prices are related US organizations. We know that currently, no country intends to switch to a gold-silver bimetallic standard or raise silver prices. Therefore, the United States will have to use its gold reserves to buy all the silver on the market at the highest price. According to investigations, speculators in London hold 100 million ounces of silver, waiting to sell to the United States. The U.S. imposition of a 50% tax on silver transactions only drives the original U.S. transactions abroad. All profits from silver price fluctuations will belong to foreign speculators.</p>
<p>Progress of the Silver Purchasing Plan</p>
<p>Since implementing the silver purchase policy, the United States has been making vigorous efforts. However, according to the quantities stipulated in the Silver Purchase Act and the current gold reserve ratio, large-scale purchases are still required. This grand silver purchase plan drains the world's resources, and the soaring prices lead to currency contraction and extreme suffering for silver-using countries. Since June of last year, the Treasury has purchased 400 million ounces of silver. However, the gold reserves in the Treasury have also increased, so more silver is needed to meet the quarter ratio. In other words, although the Treasury continues to purchase silver, it is still far from the predetermined goal. Under the current situation, another 100 million ounces need to be purchased to reach the full amount. It is uncertain where this massive amount of silver will come from. Moreover, if gold reserves increase, the amount of silver to be purchased will increase further.</p>
<p>Impact of the Silver Purchasing Plan on the Foundation of Credit</p>
<p>Some argue that reducing the Treasury's gold reserves can also reduce the silver reserves for the 1:4 ratio. However, this would weaken the foundation of the monetary system. Others claim that the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act is equivalent to redistributing the U.S.'s surplus gold to other countries, which would slightly aid the recovery of the world economy. This fallacy only sees one side of the matter. Redistributing U.S. gold is beneficial to both the U.S. and other countries, but the redistribution must occur through normal trade. Simply exchanging gold for silver and hoarding it is not a complete way of distribution. If the U.S. abandons a portion of its gold reserves, it must have equivalent useful exchange items to increase national wealth in return. Now, accumulating massive amounts of silver and raising its price, what is the use? Selling it would lower the market price. Using it to mint coins would cause currency inflation. It would be better to keep pig iron, tin, and timber in the treasury, which could be used for famine relief or public use, benefiting a wider range of people.</p>
<p>The original intention of purchasing silver was to use it as a reserve to replace gold for currency. This assumption is highly objectionable. Silver is a type of credit currency, and its ability to maintain its face value depends entirely on government regulations that allow it to be exchanged for gold and other weighed currencies. Therefore, silver itself is insufficient to constitute a reserve.</p>
<p>If the silver price rises to $1.29 or even higher, and the U.S. wants to use it as a reserve for its credit institutions, the foundation will not be solid. If there is a run on currency, even if the silver can be sold, it would be difficult to sell it at such a high price. Therefore, it would ultimately rely on gold reserves to cope. Eventually, the gold reserves will be depleted, and the gold standard will be unsustainable. Therefore, if gold reserves gradually become short, the foundation of credit will inevitably contract. It is delusional to expect a sound monetary system while using silver in place of gold as a reserve for expanding credit and currency.</p>
<p>China's Current Situation</p>
<p>China uses silver as its standard, and fluctuations in silver prices have a profound impact on its economic situation. In summary, the U.S. silver purchase policy harms China in two ways: first, it causes the exchange rate of Chinese currency to rise, hindering trade; second, silver coins flow out, currency contracts, prices fall, and trade declines. Although imposing silver export taxes and equalization taxes, they are difficult to take effect. Attracted by high prices overseas, silver is smuggled out in droves, tightening the currency situation further, and the situation worsens. Bank bankruptcies occur one after another, and the future is filled with anxiety!</p>
<p>It is doubtful whether China's situation can improve under the U.S. silver purchase policy, especially since the silver price has continued to rise since March, and the situation has been deteriorating. Although foreign banks in China have made gentleman's agreements to stop exporting silver to curb speculation, as silver prices rise, smuggling becomes more rampant. Therefore, whether silver reserves can be maintained remains to be seen. Ultimately, it may lead to the risk of suspension of convertibility of Chinese banknotes, causing a multitude of crises.</p>
<p>The purpose of the United States in raising silver prices is to increase China's purchasing power and purchase more American goods. However, the facts show the opposite. According to recent trade statistics between China and the United States, the situation is even further from the intended goal. In January of this year, the value of imported goods decreased by 14% compared to the same month last year, and in February, it decreased by 20%.</p>
<p>Other Impacts of the Silver Purchasing Policy</p>
<p>In addition to the difficulties in improving China's position, the affected areas are even more extensive. In April of this year, Mexico, which also used silver as its standard like China, was affected by high silver prices, causing disturbances, a rise in currency value, a surge in exchange rates, and a decline in trade. Silver coins were privately melted and exported in droves. It is predictable that the Mexican government cannot continue to sit idly by. On April 26, it issued orders prohibiting the melting and export of silver coins, and at the same time, it withdrew circulating silver coins and replaced them with banknotes. As a result, the exchange rate began to fall, and control was restored.</p>
<p>Comparing China and Mexico, Mexico is in a more advantageous position because it is a silver-producing country. The rise in silver prices initially benefits it. Even if there are exports, new mined silver can be used as compensation. China is different. Once silver flows out, it is a permanent loss. If it wants to compensate, it must seek it from overseas at a high price. Recently, it was heard that the Mexican government issued an order to levy taxes on newly mined silver according to the level of silver prices, so that the government can also share the benefits gained from the silver price increase. However, Mexico may still be forced to adopt managed currency in the future, leading to currency inflation, which is the same crisis as China and other countries.</p>
<p>As silver prices continue to rise, the impact will spread wider. According to the current exchange rate, if the silver price rises to $1.02 per ounce, the Spanish peseta (Spanish currency name) will be more valuable when melted into silver ingots. If the silver price rises to $1.06, the Indian rupee will also hardly escape the same fate. In summary, these factors make the current world situation more chaotic, trade is hindered, and the exchange rate stability that the world craves becomes even more difficult to restore quickly.</p>
<p>Consequences of Reduced Silver Usage</p>
<p>High silver prices force silver-using countries to abandon the silver standard and switch to the paper standard. The incessant fluctuations in the silver market weaken the belief in silver as currency. Far Eastern silver-using countries are unable to use silver as currency again and must choose other cheaper materials as currency. China and India are the main demanders of silver. In the past few years, silver has been in a state of trade deficit. We should pay special attention to the fact that before this silver price increase, several countries had adopted nickel, which has a lower value, as a substitute for silver. Nickel has the same function as silver, but it is cheaper, so it is favored by governments. The more expensive silver prices are, the more nickel is used. In short, artificially raising silver prices without promoting the use of substitutes is like raising the prices of wood, rubber, and cement without stimulating the competition of other commodities. This is unreasonable.</p>
<p>In a word, the natural market for silver has now been completely destroyed by the U.S. silver policy, and ultimately, the U.S. Treasury will become the only market for silver. So, what will happen after the United States completes the purchase of silver reserves up to 25% of the total amount of the Treasury as planned? The United States obviously cannot buy up all the silver in the world and will eventually be forced to move to a silver standard. Therefore, anything that raises prices too much will inevitably lead to its own collapse, and the future of silver is no different.</p>
<p>The U.S.'s move to raise silver prices is crippling our country's financial commerce and causing severe harm, which need not be repeated. This article is compiled from the May issue of the Citibank Monthly Report, which opposes the U.S. government's silver purchasing policy throughout. The arguments are consistent, and it repeatedly states the panic caused by the accumulation of silver-using countries, which is quite insightful. It seems that American bankers have more frequent practical contact with the Far Eastern market and have a clearer understanding of the real situation. Therefore, they can recognize the adverse impact of the silver policy on China and criticize the government's silver policy failures. From this, we can see that practitioners with practical experience are slightly better than the White House think tank that closes its doors to build cars and the silver faction that only seeks profit.

<h3>Failure of the U.S. Cotton Industry Plan</h3>
<p>— Zeng Chun</p>
<p>Since 1933, cotton consumption has shown signs of recovery. However, the long-established cotton textile industry in the United States has only made slight progress amidst decline. The reason for this is very evident in the following circumstances, such as Japan, China and other small countries importing cotton goods. Because of the smooth production conditions of their cotton textiles, the market supply and demand seems to be re-allocated. In the past year, Japan has continued to increase its exports to India, British East India, Arabia, Persia and other places. Therefore, in the past few years, the business of countries with more modern manufacturing methods has increased, while most of those with outdated machinery have remained in a state of shutdown and suffered from overproduction and low prices.</p>
<p>The U.S. government's artificial increase in cotton prices is tantamount to increasing the difficulties for manufacturers. Therefore, the recovery of world consumption is also hindered. For example, in 1933, it made every effort to reduce production and resolutely granted farmers a loan of one dime per pound, and the United States increased it to one dime and two cents per pound the following year. The U.S. government has already doubled the price of cotton in 1933 and is now taking steps to maintain its higher level. This year, it continues to restrict production. For example, on January 17, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture decided that the harvest volume should be 10,983,264 bales. Compared with 1934, it was 9,731,000 bales, and in 1933 it was 13,047,000 bales. After this decision, the price in March once fell. It was not until April that a part of it recovered. The reason for the recovery was the government's announcement that the original plan to lend one dime and two cents would be extended until June 31 of this year. Judging from the declaration of the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, it said that it would do its best to provide convenience to producers and keep the goods in the market regular. But in fact, the loan payment for this year's harvest has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>This severe means? The result is only to increase the price of U.S. cotton, and the income of the people has also increased from 484 million yuan in 1932 to 717 million yuan in 1933 and 756 million yuan in 1934. As for the income from farmers' compensation payments, it was 163 million yuan in 1933 and 117 million yuan in 1934.</p>
<p>The cotton policy of the U.S. government has affected three aspects. First, U.S. manufacturers have expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the government's move. Because the increase in cotton prices and the efforts to take care of the interests of producers, while levying handling fees on manufacturers, have affected and declined the business turnover and profits. Furthermore, the result is an increase in manufacturing costs. Although the United States has tariffs to maintain the standard, it is still profitable to import cotton goods. Therefore, the United States' imports of cotton goods from Japan increased from 789,000 square yards in 1931 to 1,116,000 square yards in 1933. In 1934, it increased to 7,287,000 square yards. Moreover, the increase in cotton prices has only reduced world consumption, and on the other hand, it has indirectly promoted countries to increase their own cotton production. Therefore, the status of U.S. cotton in world production has fallen from 54.9% in 1932 to 43.0% in 1934. If U.S. cotton still maintains this price level, the tendency of geographical redistribution will continue. For example, Brazil's cotton production has increased from 396,000 bales (500 pounds per bale) in 1932 to 1,200,000 bales in 1934. Egypt also decided to restrict it like the United States, but Egypt's output has increased from 991,000 bales in 1932 to 1,715,000 bales in 1933 and 1,560,000 bales in 1934. At the same time, China's output has also increased from 2,228,000 bales to 2,927,000 bales. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Finance: The Financial Market Was Quiet on Sunday</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday again, and banks were closed as usual. There was nothing worth recording in the market. In the money market, the overnight interest rate for silver dollars was still 20 cents. The morning and afternoon were the same. The transaction volume for discounted bills was more than 3.2 million in the morning market. There was no new trading. The transaction volume in the early market was more than 300,000. The transaction volume in the Small General Association was more than 400,000. The transaction volume for silver dollar pawn loans was only more than 200,000 for money shops to redeem. The amount of remittances from various places was more than 300,000. As for bank collections, there was nothing to note due to the Sunday holiday. The collection of silver dollar public bonds by money shops was inferior yesterday, totaling more than 37 million. According to the current trend, every Sunday, except for money shops which operate as usual, other small banks and remittance silver shops are mostly closed all day. Therefore, the news on this day is very quiet. It is sincerely feared that in the near future, money shops may also be closed on Sundays. In terms of the auxiliary currency market, the early market price for small silver dollars in Jiangnan was 833 yuan and 50 cents, and the price was the same in the afternoon market. The transaction volume was only 2,000 corners in the early market. The early market price for small silver dollars in Guangdong was 736 yuan and 20 cents, and the afternoon market price was 735 yuan and 50 cents. The transaction volume was 210,000 corners in the early market and 40,000 corners in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins increased by 1,000 texts to 344,000 texts. The transaction volume was 44,720 strings, with a total value of 13,000 silver dollars.</p>

<h3>Securities: The Bond Market Remained Quiet and Hovered for a Week. Futures Trading Resumes Today.</h3>
<p>From August 12 to 17 of last week, the trend of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange was generally hovering. The only environmental stimulus was the resignation issue of President Wang, which was barely enough to motivate the sluggish public sentiment. However, the large bulls and bears did not change their measures because of this, and still followed their fixed strategy to slowly switch positions. The most noteworthy thing in the market was the large number of bulls in No. 48. At first, because their support was thin, and then to prevent their discharge from the cage, they sell when the price is high and buy when the price is low, which makes people dizzy. In fact, they have gradually switched positions and reduced their ability to influence the market. Therefore, the price increase and decrease are small in number. It is estimated that most are waiting and watching. There is not much time left for August futures trading, and there should still be some competition this week. Last week passed, the trading was light, the market was hovering, and most of the price increases and decreases were no more than 20 or 30 cents. In the middle, due to the resignation of President Wang, the meeting fell more than 50 cents on Tuesday. Then, because there was hope that the resignation intention would be cancelled, the market price rebounded by about 50 cents on Saturday, which were the two most volatile days last week. The rest were hovering between 20 and 30 cents. Because last week was still a half-day transaction, the transaction was greatly reduced because there was no room for maneuver. The large dealers' buying and selling were mostly waiting and unmoved. Only No. 21, 47, and 48 slightly sold out. The rest were sporadic trades to switch positions. The future market will fluctuate if there is a change in the environment as the delivery period approaches. The market price result is slightly better than the previous week, ranging from 12 cents to 65 cents, while 9 holes are slightly smaller by 25 cents. The total transaction volume was 43.2 million yuan. The result of its rise and fall is compared in the left table (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan). Starting today, the daily morning and afternoon trading will resume, with two sessions each.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: U.S. Cotton Has Improved Amidst Hovering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the U.S. cotton market opened, due to poor news from Liverpool, the price of each month fell by 1 to 5 pounds. Then, because of the general opinion that the government would earnestly announce its policy, traders continued to buy in, causing the market price to gradually rise. Compared with the previous day, it rose by 10 pounds. When the market closed, some bulls took profits and the market softened slightly. As a result, the spot price rose by 5 pounds, and the futures price rose by 1 to 4 pounds. The spot price of British cotton rose by 5 points, and the futures price rose or fell by 1 to 2 points. Indian cotton short-sellers sold out, and Japanese merchants bought in slightly. The Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, the Aomula rose by 0.5 rupees, and the Bairoxi rose by 1 to 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 17th).</p>
<p>Pingguoer 134.50 Rise of 0.25 19.80</p>
<p>Aomula 186.00 0.50 27.40</p>
<p>Bairoxi 326.00 1.75 33.10</p>
<p>April-May Futures 305.75 1.00 30.20</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the April-May futures of Bairoxi Flower on the 19th was 206 rupees, up 0.25 rupees from the previous day's closing.</p>
<h3>Grain: The Price of Rice in Hexia Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>(Hunan, Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang remained more than 20, (with a total of nearly 5,000 stones of goods) and the sales market was still sluggish. The sales market only took in more than 400 packages from the Tianjin gang. The market color was difficult to cheer up. The quotations for each thick japonica and thin rice, etc., all fell by 10 or 20 cents again. However, the trend of thin rice seems to be that if the market arrives a little sparsely today and the sales market continues to move, then it seems that there may be hope of seeing a conclusion. Lu Yangjian and Yin Yuan, etc., have also continued to fall by more than 10 cents. Only Dongxin is settled.</p>

<p>(HubNorth) Yesterday, there were twenty-four or five sources from each Hexia road. The market for each good, white japonica, was still weak. The market price also dropped by a small amount of 10 or 20 cents. The other rice on the early market was dull. Prices are down by about 20 cents. Dongxin japonica arrived with 600 to 700, the other market has too many, the market shape avoids settlement. White Yuan continued to shrink by a small angle of permit, although the new customer sharp car transport one is not prosperous, the sales channel is not smooth, the price shape is peaceful, and the remaining goods are also tired by one percent to one dime,</p>

<h3>Environment and Art</h3>
<p>—Fulang</p>
<p>The term "environment" here needs an explanation. It does not refer solely to the natural environment, as Turner specifically did, but more broadly to the social environment, i.e., the various stable conditions of society.</p>
<p>Advocates of artistic freedom often deny the social nature of art, detaching it from social life and treating it as an independent, surreal entity. This is a ridiculous prejudice. They fail to realize that artworks are ultimately the products of human thoughts and emotions, not things that fall from the sky out of nowhere. The social environment determines people's consciousness; therefore, the thoughts and emotions conveyed through artworks cannot escape the constraints of the specific social environment. In other words, artworks inevitably reflect the life patterns of that specific society. Whether an artist creates consciously or unconsciously, whether they apply unlimited freedom of thought and technique in their work, their consciousness remains dictated by society. Artworks are determined by the conditions of reality and cannot emerge independently of the formation or limitations imposed by these social factors.</p>
<p>Since art is determined by the social environment, it is inherently linked to the developmental stage of that society. That is, under certain social conditions, there must be a specific kind of art. Art will undergo changes in substance in response to different social environments.</p>
<p>By examining the differences among Classicism, Romanticism, and Naturalism, and how they are determined by social environmental factors, we can understand the close relationship between art and literature and the environment.</p>
<p>In what kind of social environment did Classical literature emerge?</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages, the political and social structure was built upon a feudal system of exploitation. The feudal aristocracy considered themselves noble and refined individuals, demanding reasonable etiquette, graceful speech, and comfortable enjoyment. Consequently, the social environment fostered a solemn and harmonious classical literature. The characteristics of classical literature are dignity, order, and a content that strives to be elegant and tactful, suitable for the tastes of the nobility. Therefore, harsh realities, scenes of killing, clamor, and passionate actions were all excluded. We only need to examine French classical tragedy to understand this. This reflection is especially profoundly expressed in the visual arts. The solemn and magnificent architecture of Mansart and others, as well as the grand gardens designed by Le Nôtre, and all the decorations in the Palace of Versailles, all express the spirit of the aristocracy at the time. This classical art was clearly centered around the royal court, and it was determined by the social structure of that era.</p>
<p>When economic liberalism propelled the French Revolution, the newly emerging bourgeoisie seized the aristocracy's economic status and overthrew their political rule. In this environment of developing liberalism, Romantic literature emerged. Romantic literature transformed both the content and form of Classical literature. The former was solemn and regulated, while the latter was passionate and unrestrained, with tragic love deaths and heroic duels becoming the sole content of the works. Rousseau's works can be considered representative.</p>
<p>As the bourgeoisie reached maturity, industry became fully mechanized, and capitalists stabilized their golden position, while natural science flourished, and beautiful fantasies gradually disappeared. In this social environment, the passion of Romanticism naturally transformed into the "cold observation" of Naturalism. Furthermore, with capital newly concentrated and everything based on money, society also had many ugly aspects and corrupt flaws. Naturalistic works thus reflected this state, with exposing darkness as their characteristic.</p>
<p>The above analysis is sufficient to illustrate the relationship between the social environment and art.</p>
<h3>An Uncommon Group (Part 1)</h3>
<p>—Zhou Wen</p>
<p>"Ah, I thought you had an appointment with Mr. Zhang today and wouldn't grace us with your presence. Haha, surprisingly…" The host, with his hair slicked back, greeted a pale-faced guest with a clean-shaven beard and a bluish circle around his lips with a wide smile. He extended his right hand, fingers outstretched, inviting the guest inside.</p>
<p>"Since I promised you, of course, I had to come," the pale-faced man said, turning to smile as he walked. "Originally, Mr. Zhang himself drove his private car early to invite me, but all his guests today are businessmen, and their conversations never stray from money. Alas, I can't get along with them, you know, those so-called com…" He suddenly withheld the last word in a subtle way.</p>
<p>The slick-haired host opened his mouth in a daze, his footsteps almost stopping, but he immediately laughed loudly:</p>
<p>"Haha, I also… can't get along… with them… So, I guessed you would definitely grace us with your presence because all my friends from the Lotus Poetry Society are here today, and they all said they wanted you to come and guide them. But," he glanced cautiously at the pale-faced man with a flash in his eyes, "I also invited two so-called businessmen as an aside, but…"</p>
<p>The pale-faced man's ears turned slightly red, but he immediately opened his mouth and laughed, patting the host's shoulder, interrupting his words:</p>
<p>"Then this is a different matter, especially since…"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," the host eagerly interjected. "However, although these two are so-called businessmen, they are not vulgar: one is Mr. Wang, our boss, who can also compose a few lines of poetry; as for the other, Mr. Liu, he is recently planning to start a magazine business, so I specially—incidentally—invited him to chat casually." As he said this, his face suddenly became serious, and he whispered into the pale-faced man's ear: "Because I'm planning to edit a magazine for him…"</p>
<p>The pale-faced man was stunned—"Edit"? Him? The thought flashed through his mind, and he stared deeply at the host's face next to him, as if seeing a newspaper advertisement where the host's name was actually squeezed in front of his own! He turned his face away, scratched the back of his head with a claw-like hand, and asked with a sideways glance:</p>
<p>"Is this Mr. Liu the same Mr. Liu—Liu—Liu what's-his-name that we met at Mr. Huang's banquet?"</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right," the host nodded repeatedly. "You know, round, chubby, just like that. He also said he admires you, the great poet."</p>
<p>"Oh?" The pale-faced man immediately smiled happily, turning his face and staring intently at the host's red lips for a long time, deep in thought.</p>
<p>As the host walked, his face suddenly stirred, his eyes shifting back and forth a few times. Then a smile flashed from his lips, moving slightly, but he kept his lips tightly closed, trying not to laugh.</p>
<h3>Seaside in Summer</h3>
<h3>More About Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>—Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>I have already discussed the poem "Suffering from Mosquitoes" by the Southern Song poet Fan Chengda in Free Talk, which recorded the fact of mosquito fumigation at that time. I think mosquito fumigation did not originate in the Song Dynasty, just like mosquito nets, it was something that existed long ago. I remember in Zhuangzi's "Yielding the Throne," it was said that the King of Yue escaped the throne and hid in a cave, and the people used the method of fumigating the cave to smoke him out. Even today, hunters still often fumigate caves when searching for wild animals living in caves. To say that mosquito fumigation was something that existed long ago, at least a thousand years ago, people knew about fumigating mosquitoes, this statement should not be too wrong.</p>
<p>In our hometown, on pleasant summer and autumn nights, beside the bean trellises and melon racks, in the remaining space in front of the courtyard steps, families would gather to enjoy the cool air. Mosquitoes would hum and fly around, and people would swat them with palm-leaf fans, but it was difficult to keep up. If you tried to swat them with your palm, the mosquito would have already flown away, and you would end up hurting yourself. If you wanted to lie down on a bamboo bed and sleep peacefully, mosquitoes would not show any consideration. Even if you had a mosquito net, mosquitoes would find gaps to fly in, disrupting your sleep all night. Zhao Oubei had a poem titled "A Mosquito":</p>
<p>Six-foot bed draped with black gauze,</p>
<p>A tiny gap carelessly left invites ridicule.</p>
<p>A single mosquito disturbs one all night,</p>
<p>Small evils are more numerous than you think!</p>
<p>Although Oubei's poem is a satirical poem containing a lesson, a mosquito entering the net can prevent you from sleeping all night. At least, this is true for people like me who suffer from neurasthenia. My aversion to mosquitoes is greater than usual, and there is a reason for it. Recalling my childhood, living in the countryside, fumigating mosquitoes was my special duty before dinner in the hot season. It was not enough to use sausage-like sawdust mosquito coils, so I would tie up bundles of rice straw, light them on fire, and pile grain husks and Huolazi (a kind of raw grass) on top of them. A plume of black smoke would rise like a black dragon, and the mosquitoes would fly away without resistance. If bones were left over from eating turtles, or eel bones were left over from gutting eels, ground into powder, and mixed with grain sugar, the smoke produced would be even more effective, and mosquitoes would fall down in droves. As for sawdust, even if it was sawed from oak wood and used to fumigate mosquitoes, it would be very effective, but it seemed inferior to pyrethrum.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes, despite being fanned, smoked, blown by the wind, beaten by the rain, and eaten by bats, still do not become extinct. It is said that they grow on trees, and this kind of tree is called the mosquito mother tree. It is also said that they are spat out from the mouths of a certain bird, and this bird is called the Quemu bird. I am too lazy to look up books like Erya Materia Medica, but in short, the ancients had this saying. There is also Erya Yi saying, "Mosquitoes born in grass have particularly sharp mouthparts and patterned legs, and Wu Xing calls them leopard-legged mosquitoes." Whether mosquitoes are born in grass still needs careful observation. However, leopard-legged mosquitoes are the fiercest type of mosquito. Their bodies are smaller than other mosquitoes, and their legs, waists, and abdomens have white rings. Their proboscises are sharp and long, and they are very good at stinging people. Shady places and dirty water are their favorite habitats. In my hometown dialect, they are called dung mosquitoes. According to recent studies, mosquito larvae are wrigglers in sweat, which transform into mosquitoes. Therefore, the best way to kill mosquitoes is to prevent the accumulation of dirty water or kill all the wrigglers in the dirty water. However, some people say that the Anopheles mosquito, which transmits malaria, has larvae that often live in streams and fresh water, unlike ordinary mosquito eggs that are laid in dirty water. This type of mosquito has antennae that are thick and short, wings with brown spots, a head and thorax that are light gray, and an abdomen that is light green. When it rests, it always raises its hind legs and positions its body diagonally. If people are not careful, they can be infected by this type of mosquito, which injects a tiny bacterium into the person's skin through its proboscis. Not only will the skin immediately become red, painful, and swollen, but if your resistance is weak, the malaria bacteria will attack your bloodstream, causing you to suffer from malaria. It used to be said that people suffer from malaria because they are haunted by malaria ghosts. Han Yu has a poem scolding the malaria ghost. Sou Shen Ji (In Search of the Supernatural) says, "In the past, Emperor Zhuanxu had three sons who died and became epidemic ghosts. One lived in the Jiang River as a malaria ghost, one lived in the Ruo River as a goblin ghost, and one lived in human palaces and was good at frightening young children as a little ghost." Who knew that the malaria ghost that causes people to suffer from malaria was originally a mosquito!</p>
<p>Some people say that the mosquitoes that suck human blood are female mosquitoes, and male mosquitoes only suck the sap of trees. Whether this is true, I have not personally seen. Some people also say that the mosquitoes that buzz are male mosquitoes, and the ones that do not buzz are female mosquitoes. This saying is supported by a poem, also by Zhao Oubei. The poem says:</p>
<p>White birds gather in formations,</p>
<p>Their buzzing like thunder fills the hall.</p>
<p>Who knows among them are silent ones,</p>
<p>Catching one off guard, skillfully seeking openings.</p>
<p>People only know to swat at the buzzing ones,</p>
<p>Unaware of the silent ones.</p>
<p>One day, swatting a silent mosquito,</p>
<p>I realized there is cunning malice among them.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the time of creation,</p>
<p>The two energies were already subtly divided.</p>
<p>The same shape, but two different natures,</p>
<p>The buzzing are male, the silent are female.</p>
<p>People see this every day but pay no attention,</p>
<p>Careful observation reveals differences among similarities.</p>
<p>Everything has yin and yang,</p>
<p>This is also a matter for investigating things.</p>
<p>I laugh at myself for reading books for eighty years,</p>
<p>And only now learning about this tiny insect!</p>
<p>According to Zhao Oubei, the silent male mosquitoes also bite people. Zhao Oubei laughed at himself for reading books for eighty years before distinguishing between male and female mosquitoes, as if he thought that investigating things was a trivial matter. In fact, why be afraid of triviality when it comes to investigating things? Even organisms that are too small to be seen with the naked eye need to be studied. In the 19th century, the French scientist Pasteur spent his life studying airborne microorganisms, or bacteria, and established the field of microbiology. From then on, people learned that infectious diseases such as diphtheria, dysentery, malaria, tuberculosis, measles, smallpox, the Black Death, cholera, and rabies are all caused by various germs. At the same time, he also invented the process of bacterial fermentation, making great contributions to winemaking and vinegar making. He also invented many new treatment methods in medicine. These great achievements in science all came from the study of trivial microorganisms. From ancient times Chinese gentleman devoted to investigating things were only willing to work hard on books. It is no wonder that Zhao Oubei was unwilling to sincerely study the sexes of mosquitoes.</p>
<h3>Seaside Tragedy (Part 6)</h3>
<p>—Original by Balzac, Translated by Wang Jiansheng</p>
<p>That good man Chabrol—as if misfortune was destined—returned by boat, and as he landed, he saw a small piece of paper floating on the water. He picked it up and brought it to his wife, who recognized the handwriting as her own and collapsed on the floor. Chabrol was silent. Then he went to Nacroisic, where he heard his son playing billiards. “If you return the gold to me in full, I will wait at the door and reward you with silver instead,” the kind woman had given him the coins. Chabrol accepted. "Very well," he said before returning. The event stirred the whole city again. But this is what I know; the rest is for each person to speculate. He told his wife to prepare to clean the downstairs room. A fire was lit in the hearth, two candles were lit, two chairs were placed on one side of the hearth, and a stool was placed on the other side. Then he told his wife to take out his wedding clothes and instructed her to wear her wedding dress as well. He put on his own clothes, and as he dressed, he found his brother, who was guarding outside and reported to him that if he heard any sound on either side of the seaside beach—this side and the side of the Guilland marshes. When he assumed his wife was dressed, he stepped back into the house, checked his bullets, and hid his gun in the corner of the chimney. Soon, Grapheix returned; he was late. He had been gambling wildly until ten o'clock, and he was helped through the lower path by someone. When his uncle heard him shouting on the marshy side of the seaside beach, he immediately grabbed him. He brought him back without saying a word. As he came in, his father pointed to the stool and said, "You sit there. You are now sitting before the parents you have offended, who will be your judges.” Grapheix began to cry because Chabrol's face shone with a strange and determined expression. His mother sat up straight. "If you scream, move an inch, if you cannot sit straight on the stool like a pillar," Pirau said, aiming his gun at his son, "I will kill you like killing a dog." This worthless treasure became dumbly silent, and his mother did not say a word. "Look here," Pirau asked his son, "here is a piece of paper that was used to wrap a Spanish gold doubloon, which was in your mother's bed; your mother is the only one who knows where this coin is hidden; when I landed, I found this paper floating on the water. You cleverly gave—just tonight—this Spanish gold coin to old woman Freland, and your mother could not find her coin in bed, please explain." Grapheix said he did not take his mother's coin; he had spent his own money in Nantes. "That's great!" Pirau said: "Can you prove it to us?" "I have money." "You didn't secretly take your mother's?" "No." "Can you swear to God?" He was about to swear to heaven when his mother looked up at him and said, "Grapheix, my child, be careful, do not make a false oath; repent; there is still time." She wept. "You are really a good boy," he said; "you always make me confused." Chabrol's face turned pale.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>The Responsible Party for Children's Marriages</h3>
<p>—Fei</p>
<p>In recent news in this newspaper's local section, there were four suicide cases, two men and two women. The causes of suicide for three of them were unclear, but presumably they were due to economic pressure or romantic failures. This issue has already been extensively discussed in this newspaper and in other newspapers, so I won't discuss it further here.</p>
<p>What I want to discuss now is one of the four suicide cases: Xu Zhihui from Ningbo, who worked as a bookkeeper in a wild game shop in the Caishi Street area. In recent years, he had accumulated a large debt due to his children's marriages. Recently, he was pressed by creditors and unable to cope, so he committed suicide by taking poison. This matter is the urgent problem at hand.</p>
<p>In recent years, countless people have accumulated high debts due to their children's marriages, not only now, but also in the past. However, in the past, under the patriarchal social system, parents had to make the decisions about their sons' and daughters' marriages. As the saying goes, "Raising a child is a lifelong worry." When sons grow up, they must marry, and when daughters grow up, they must be married. The children's marriages were entirely the responsibility of the parents, and this responsibility was absolutely undeniable. Now, with women's liberation and freedom of marriage, if parents choose a spouse for their children without their consent, the marriage agreement is completely invalid. From this point of view, the responsibility for children's marriages now rests entirely with the children, not with the parents.</p>
<p>I will cite an example from yesterday's local news in a certain newspaper. Jian Lihua, a student at Guangzhao Middle School in the Jiangwan area, and He Xuemei, a female student at a certain school, developed from friendship to love and had long implicitly agreed on the marriage issue. However, when their parents learned of this, they prevented the marriage from proceeding. Jian was greatly affected and committed suicide with Ms. He by taking poison. In recent years, cases of suicide due to failed marriages can be said to be heard from time to time and are common, not worth mentioning. This is originally the most recent example. These are all evils caused by parents unnecessarily taking responsibility and insisting on taking responsibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this responsibility is not easy to bear. Arranging marriages for children has already added a lot of debt. However, after marriage, it is impossible to prevent them from having children, so the burden is increased by another layer. Thus, one person bears not only the burden of their children's education but also the burden of their children and grandchildren. With such a heavy burden, I am afraid that few parents can afford this responsibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, parents now only bear the cost of their children's education. However, even the cost of education alone is not easy for parents to afford until their children graduate from university. As for the issue of engagement and marriage, let them make their own decisions. They should assess whether they can afford to support a family. If they cannot, they should first solve the issue of employment or education before considering marriage. Therefore, in Eastern and Western countries today, men marry very late, and this is the reason. Because it is easier to bear the burden of one person, but more difficult to bear the burden of a family.</p>
<p>As for the comprador bourgeoisie, who are inherently wealthy, they are not included in this example. Therefore, under the current social system, it is simply foolish to still put the issue of children's marriages on one's own shoulders. They simply do not understand the current laws and the current social situation. It is truly idiotic because the current laws no longer allow you to bear this burden. The current society can no longer enable you to bear this burden. And the children do not want you to bear this burden. What are the parents still trying to bear?</p>
<p>The group marriage system, although it has reduced the temporary expenses of marriage, is already considerable, but the daily living expenses cannot be completely saved due to group marriage. Thus, the whip of life still drives oneself. Therefore, one's own marriage should be solved by oneself, and the children's marriages should be solved by the children themselves.</p>
<h3>Cicada, Part Two</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>In the previous article, I only briefly wrote about the relationship between cicadas and my childhood. Now, I want to write a little more about various aspects of cicadas.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of cicadas. One is entirely brown, with a larger body and the loudest sound. Luo Binwang's poem about cicadas, "Four lands chime with cicada songs, a southern prisoner's thoughts run deep; I cannot bear to see my darkened temples, so I sing this song with a white head..." probably refers to this type of cicada. In my hometown, this cicada is called "Zhīliǎo." Another type has a slender, smaller body and is light blue. In my hometown, it's called "Xué sī dài." Still another resembles "Zhīliǎo" but is much smaller and dark gray. In my hometown, it's called "Yǐn liǎo." "Zhīliǎo," "Xué sī dài," and "Yǐn liǎo" are all named after their sounds. "Zhīliǎo" has a larger presence and a "masculine" quality. "Xué sī dài" has a crisper sound, is highly alert, and isn't easily caught. Its body is simply as beautiful as a young girl of sixteen, but even if you catch it, it's not easy to keep alive. However, I especially like this type. "Yǐn liǎo" has the smallest sound and a "country girl" quality, which I don't particularly like.</p>
<p>Here, I want to talk about the timing of cicada songs. When "the wearying weather begins to lengthen the days," the first sound that comes out of the thick green shade is always "Zhīliǎo." This call gives you a special feeling; you know that early summer has arrived. The sound is very crisp and clear. The feeling it reflects is joy and delight. When "Xué sī dài" also starts calling, the sound of "Zhīliǎo" gradually becomes heavier, especially in the afternoon. The fiery sun almost scorches your head, and sweat drips down like rain. You only feel soft and lazy, helplessly wanting to take a nap. But at that time, the "Zhīliǎo's" sound is especially loud, making you feel annoyed, as if all the heat is being stirred up by its vibrating wings.</p>
<p>"Xué sī dài" doesn't usually like to call during the day, and even less so under the fiery sun. It calls especially vigorously when the eastern sky is just starting to turn red, when everything is still in slumber. Otherwise, it calls especially vigorously in the evening when the sun sets. Sometimes, on hotter, moonlit nights, it will also call out in a clear voice. "Xué sī dài" is truly the poet of summer.</p>
<p>When thunderstorms are coming, and the air is so stuffy that it's hard to breathe, the "Zhīliǎo," "Xué sī dài," and "Yǐn liǎo" will launch a total calling mobilization. With dragonflies flying all over the sky, the sound of cicadas is a noisy mass, but I don't like this situation. I like it in the autumn afternoon when a vast expanse of setting sun grows larger and redder, the autumn wind with its melancholic flavor sweeps through the trees, and wisps of evening smoke rise one after another, like dreams flitting away. At that time, one or two "Zhīliǎo" drag out their calls, seemingly far away in the sky, intermittent and drawn-out. If you are a poet, you are sure to be overwhelmed by this melancholic flavor. Four years ago, I wrote two lines of poetry: "Cicadas sing outside the autumn willows, smoke scatters in the evening wind." I wanted to depict that situation, but how could I capture even a fraction of it?</p>
<p>Huang Zhongze's saying, "Even when the cicada is about to swallow its voice, it still has a sound," probably refers to this type of dying cicada. Because the sound is almost just a wisp now, as soft as a remaining strand of silk, as melancholic as the autumn wind blowing through reeds.</p>
<p>Once the autumn wind arrives, the dying cicadas don't even have a dying sound anymore. They cling tightly to the frost-covered withered branches, letting the wind and rain erode them. Thinking about this ending, and also thinking about their arrogance when singing loudly in the wind, I feel like mourning the shells of the dying cicadas clinging to the withered branches, just as I sigh for a poet with a short life.</p>
<h3>The Face of "Betty Boop"</h3>
<p>— Liú Shuǐ</p>
<p>A friend who returned from Japan gave me a lovely gift: a clay mask of the innocent face often seen in movies—"Betty Boop."</p>
<p>In her round, black pupils, eternal innocence is hidden. In her bright red lips, a completely genuine smile is held. On her cheeks with dimples, a light-colored rose is printed. She has golden curly hair, and a blue and white ribbon tied around her neck.</p>
<p>So, I hung her on the wall by my bed, and she always wears a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>I often stare blankly at her, and that long-lost, hazy childhood innocence, which seems to be separated by several centuries, is reborn in my heart, which has grown old from the struggles of life.</p>
<p>Every day, when I am exhausted from the struggles of life, I lie down on the bed, put my hands behind my head, and look at her big, round, innocent black pupils. In those pupils, I relive a dream. It was an innocent dream from a time long ago, I don't know how long ago. The things in the dream are already very hazy, so hazy that they feel like sunlight felt on a photograph. I can't grasp anything real. I close my eyes and try hard to recall, as if going upstream along a silver river to find a precious thing that has been lost. However, it is an ethereal dream, impossible to grasp the outline of...</p>
<p>In the window of the building across from mine, a child's face often appears. He (or she) always stares blankly at the ground or at me. Several times, I wanted to relive the events of my lost childhood from the child's face. So, I smiled at him and waved to him, with a heart that I thought was innocent. However, the child remained wooden. He could not understand the heart across the street. He looked with doubtful eyes for a moment, then turned around and left.</p>
<p>This time, it was my turn to stand there blankly. I realized that my childhood innocence had long been extinguished. Although we are only separated by more than ten feet, the state of our minds is separated by an unmeasurable distance, so far, so far... So, I helplessly had to let my mood grow closer day by day to old age, like an old man with a cane on his way home at dusk.</p>
<p>One morning, I took the clay mask from the wall, touched it with my hand, stood blankly at the window, my heart empty, nothing lingering there, gazing at the distant sky. Suddenly, I heard a burst of innocent laughter, laughter like silver bells in the morning breeze; it was the laughter of the child across the street. Moreover, he was waving to me. I immediately understood that he was waving to the "Betty Boop" mask in my hand.</p>
<p>So, every day, I hold the "Betty Boop" mask and wave and smile to the child across the street. I use this to forget all the worries of adulthood. The child across the street has not been estranged from me since then.</p>
<p>But today, when I came back from outside, I found that the "Betty Boop" mask was shattered. It lay scattered in pieces by the bed. Sadly, I picked up the broken pieces to show the child across the street, but he was stunned for a moment, then suddenly cried "Wah!"</p>
<h3>Early Autumn Night on Erhai Lake</h3>
<p>— Xīn Ěr</p>
<p>Erhai Beach! It seems like a pure and beautiful dreamland beyond the dust. There, my infinite pure and innocent soul is deeply imprinted. How can I not miss it? Like a beautiful dream that has disappeared, a heart intoxicated in a beautiful dream has also disappeared without a trace! What remains in my chest are some reminiscent, melancholic feelings. The beautiful scenery passes in an instant, followed by an unforgettable sorrow; the journey of life is so hasty and changeable. On a distant and tiring journey, I feel suffocated, and even the mood to reminisce is often abandoned. However, the autumn wind is rising again. A sore chest and weak legs make me unable to help but feel sad, and the autumn wind stirs up old feelings!</p>
<p>A heart shattered like fallen flowers trampled underfoot is hard to find! So, I can only say: that heart is probably sunk to the bottom of Erhai Lake! In the clear waters of that Jade Erhai!</p>
<p>The autumn wind is rising again, unable to stir up that sunken heart; but it does ripple countless turquoise waves on Erhai Lake.</p>
<p>"Ah, Erhai in early autumn, the face of Erhai like a beauty just out of the bath in the sky! Even if that heart is hard to find! But, Erhai in early autumn, how can I forget you!"</p>
<p>That is Nature worthy of singing; no, it is my purest and truest old friend. Only it is forever pure and true, forever beautiful and graceful! Forever worthy of people's remembrance. No matter how wind and rain ravage it, it remains pure and beautiful unchanged; but the hearts of fickle people are terrible! Oh, forget the terrible things!</p>
<p>"Living by the Erhai Lake, I don't know the suffering of the world," in those days...</p>
<p>Ah, I remember! The folk festival of July 15th. After forgetting everything and enjoying the bright autumn moon like a jade plate on the Mid-Autumn Festival, Erhai and the autumn moon were the places where my whole heart lingered. From the waxing crescent moon to the waning crescent moon, from the light turquoise waves of early autumn to the jade Erhai waves of late autumn.</p>
<p>The spring water of Jade Erhai is full and charming, and the east wind is warm and mellow, almost like being drunk; but I love Erhai in early autumn even more. The turquoise water is even more affectionate, with a few more refined and delicate features. The atmosphere above and below is even more refreshing and clear. Heaven, water, moon, and people are all covered with a layer of fresh joy. Erhai in early autumn is another newborn world! My mood is also reborn.</p>
<p>Spring flowers and autumn moon, especially the new autumn moon of Erhai, reflect the world, like a newly dressed beauty waiting in a tower, that fresh, clear, bright, silver-plated scene, that light, that joyful feeling of wanting to dance and sing...</p>
<p>The wind in early autumn carries a slight chill; but it is storing infinite gentleness, making people feel the warmth of life. Wandering along the Erhai beach, from this different sky, wind, moon, and water, I clearly distinguish the beauty of the new autumn; clearly feeling the real existence of heaven and earth and the human world.</p>
<p>The faint dusk slowly descends from the mountains, and the people on the Erhai beach are engrossed by the increasingly tranquil atmosphere. At that time, although the night comes slowly; but the night in Dali does not have a dark and terrible scene; only slowly, people will exclaim with surprise or whisper with praise - ah, that golden plate, that new moon!</p>
<p>Looking far away, the turquoise waves of Erhai, like a belt of fresh green leaves, are light, elegant, free, and a vibrant mood fills my heart. The new autumn wind of the night makes people melt away, and I naturally board a light boat, feeling like I am sleeping in a sweet dream and floating with the gentle wind and turquoise water. On the turquoise water, is my home, the warm embrace of the breasts of the beauty in my ideal. At this time, everything else in life is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>Drifting far away, a pale yellow color emerges from between the bleached clouds, like a clean face shining. Gradually, the pale yellow color becomes thicker and wider, permeating and changing, and golden clouds like flowers are scattered on the horizon. The horizon changes from noble and sparkling to golden and bright. The sea and the horizon, a captivating and beautiful night scene, makes people want to chase after it. Chase to the horizon!</p>
<p>Looking around Erhai, under the tranquil atmosphere like a deep forest, the bright silver light is reflected everywhere. Jade Erhai has put on a rustling silver bathing gown. On Erhai, the turquoise waves are dotted with infinite sparkling golden and silver colors, like jade belts floating in the wind, like ten thousand points of gold on the waves. The people on the boat will whisper to the sky and the sea: let me sleep in your embrace forever? However, how often is it that people are separated at the ends of the earth? Erhai, where are you? Dreamlike life... the autumn wind is rising again!</p>
<h3>Bird and Insect Essays</h3>
<p>— Lǐ Ní</p>
<p>I casually recall the saying, "Welcoming spring with the song of birds." However, every spring, I don't often hear "birds" "singing" on the branches— sweetly singing clear and pleasant songs of welcoming spring. Except for the orioles and parrots kept in cages, hanging in the living rooms or houses of wealthy families for people to enjoy and entertain themselves, sometimes in the silent and solemn air of the morning or afternoon, they casually sing one or two little tunes to aid people's clear interest? To adjust people's mental fatigue. However, their occasional singing does not seem to be "welcoming spring," and even less does it "report spring." Even in the severe cold of snowy days, they will still leisurely sing. Their singing is just casually stretching their throats for a while, doing a little play. These birds, fed by people in the warm rooms of wealthy families all their lives, like domestic animals, are full, warm, and leisurely, without any worries. They have long lost their original spirituality. Therefore, the birds that welcome spring naturally do not refer to these "domestic birds" fed in warm rooms who have lost their freedom. In addition, the little sparrows seem to show a joyful expression on the surface in the spring, jumping and chirping under the eaves, however, the sound is trivial and fragmented, short and not clear, so it sounds a bit unpleasant. As for the crows, they croak and caw annoyingly all year round! Hearing their sound makes people disgusted! And their croaking does not distinguish between spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Even in the extremely hot days of June, or the snowy and drizzly seasons of severe winter, they still croak and caw incessantly, simply like troublemakers. Apart from this, every spring, I rarely hear other birds that roam the universe and welcome spring, reporting the news of spring to me. Perhaps this is because I live in the city and am too far away from the natural world? Even a few years ago when I lived in my second hometown, the Southern country—Siam—at Sambari, I could see unnamed little birds with beautiful long tails jumping on the forked branches in the depths of the green shade every day. Sometimes they would stretch their necks and happily sing nice songs, but their singing also did not distinguish between seasons. Perhaps the environment made them not know what is called spring, because the Southern country is immersed in a hot atmosphere all year round, and there is no such thing as spring at all, so I have not had the opportunity to understand the ancient saying "welcoming spring with the song of birds" to this day, which is very regrettable!</p>
<p>Since I have not had the opportunity to understand "welcoming spring with the song of birds," I have deeply experienced another ancient saying: "welcoming autumn with the song of insects." Every time in the season from late summer to early autumn, this is the world of insects. Textile maids, "Zhīliǎo," cicadas... how lively they are chirping and chirping under the base of the wall and on the tree branches. Especially in the quiet afternoon, the waves of slight warm breeze caress people as if they have drunk too much wine, silently and softly sinking into the land of sleep, the chirping of the textile maids, like the sound coming from a weaving machine, is long and loud, lazily climbing over the window, awakening people's sweet dreams. I remember when I was a child, every time I took a nap, I was always awakened by its chirping, so I always felt a little unhappy, rubbing my sleepy eyes, and asked my mother, "What is this insect sound?" My mother replied with a kind and pleasant voice, "It's a textile maid, - pushing those lazy and sleepy girls to wake up quickly and weave!" But, to this day, I still do not have a good feeling for the chirping of textile maids. Perhaps this is the mischief of my stubborn and eccentric nature. Secondly, there are those "Zhīliǎo" that are kept in small bamboo cages as toys and sold along the way to children for fun. Although they will also sing nice sounds clang clang clang, harmoniously playing in the quiet time, I always feel that their fate is like "domestic birds," after all, they are pitiful! Among the insects, the one that gives me a good feeling is the cicada, especially the singing cicada at the end of autumn. Its intermittent calls, like going through a lifetime of training, have reached the realm of decline; therefore, the sound it calls out carries a bit of hoarseness and sadness, as if it cannot bear the wear and tear of the line of life, and at the same time, it is full of sour and bitter flavors. Although I am a little afraid to hear this sound, I like to hear this call with a bit of warning. Every time after a heavy downpour, the charming sun is re-embedded in the blue sky like jade, at this time everything on the earth is particularly fresh, so you lean on the window, leisurely looking at the clear blue sky outside the window, and the green leaves flashing with golden light, quietly listening to the solitary playing of one or two intermittent singing cicadas, this is a fresh poetic scene, and makes your heart feel infinitely comfortable! Now it is again the season of "singing insects," well, let us quietly listen to the chirping of the insects, happily sing and chant.</p>

<p>Just when the little maid emptied the old master's chamber pot, the old master was escorting the concubine back from the dance hall</p>
<h3>Flight (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jīn Guāng</p>
<p>One mountain after another, one river after another, one village after another, passed under their weary feet; they were making a homeless flight. ———— They were a group of homeless refugees.</p>
<p>Old, young, male, female, they were more than eighty in total. The flood devoured their hometown, devoured their family members, devoured everything in their hometown, but left a group of remaining ones; but they had to make a homeless flight on an unfamiliar road.</p>
<p>They passed through many villages, passed through many ancient towns, but a series of "defend the dikes! defend the dikes!" made them not dare to stay in one village, only to rush south past that dense forest. Too much timber would hinder the flooding.</p>
<p>Now they had more than one hundred and eighty companions, those more than one hundred were refugees from other villages who had followed along the way.</p>
<p>The boundless twilight was secretly stretching out over the desolate autumn wilderness, a great desolation locked up the weary hearts of a group of people, the night had already lurked in the gray forest ahead. A natural reaction floated in everyone's heart; but they were unwilling to say it, letting it entangle their weary hearts and accelerate their beating. ———— "We have to travel at night again today!"</p>
<p>A burst of children's crying disrupted the hearts of the adults; followed by a burst of sighs, homing crows brought them into an even more vast dusk; foolishly gazing at that sky full of black clouds, was the hometown devoured by the flood; a burst of heartache branded a painful mark on their hearts.</p>
<p>Step by step, this group of people walked into the dense forest, they watched the net of night stretch out from under the black tree roots, waves of terrifying west winds rustled, randomly blowing down half-ground half-remaining leaves, experience told them that a terrifying night was already waiting in front of them; a burst of chills disrupted everyone's mood.</p>
<p>The net of night was heavily spread out, the darkness lost the trees on both sides, lost the road under their feet; everyone could not see clearly everything outside themselves, only carefully spread their legs apart, dragging their fatigue, lowered their heads, pretending to be calm, making a hopeful exploration in this desolate autumn forest; but hidden under the waves of cluttered footsteps and hurried breathing was chills and disappointment.</p>

<p>Hán Lèyú lost his wife in an early drought year. The only one at home was his weak daughter named Xiǎoméi. Waiting to be married. Xiǎoméi was seventeen years old. Beautiful on the outside and wise on the inside. Her father's doting was more than usual. Hán Lèyú accompanied Lǐ Shǒubái to his home. Because he did not see Xiǎoméi, he asked the servant Èrtū. He said that the girl was picking beans in the garden and had not returned. Hán Lèyú then instructed Èrtū to go in and make tea, and bring out two basins of hot water. He asked Lǐ Shǒubái and his servant to wash their faces and hands. Shǒubái sat in the hall. He was talking with Hán Lèyú. Suddenly, he saw a beautiful young girl at the door. She glanced inside. This girl was Hán Xiǎoméi. Seeing a guest in the hall, she turned around and left. Lǐ Shǒubái saw that she was born with a simple innocence. Her posture was touching. He was about to ask, but was afraid that she was Hán's daughter. It was not convenient to be rash. Unknowingly, his body moved and spilled the teacup on the table. Shǒubái regretted his rashness. He did not know what to do.</p>

<p>Opening: "Shanghai Sketches of People"</p>
<p>The prosperous scenery describes Shanghai. A land of riches with paper, wine, and gold. When night falls, the electric lights are as bright as day. Snakes, gods, cows, and ghosts all come on stage. The foreign concession is known as a den of dissipation. There is a group of rich young men and women in fine clothes. They live in large foreign houses. They have a car to go in and out. They fly around in great style. They sell their precious time in leisure. They use the money provided by their parents. They live a life of pleasure without restraint. They indulge themselves as they please. There are those who take their lovers to the cinema. They embrace beautiful women in the dance hall. There are those who spend a fortune on prostitutes. They enjoy themselves all night long. There are those who open hotels for couples. They make secret agreements to go to the high hall of love. There are also roulette wheels, dog racing, Jai Alai, and flower betting. They gamble several times a night. Ordinary entertainment includes mahjong. A thousand-dollar stake is considered a small game. Such prosperity, such a night, is wild and absurd. They squander money like dirt. Even if they have a fortune of ten thousand gold, it will not last long. In the end, their reputation is ruined and their gold is gone. They suffer the consequences of their own actions. They can only write articles on the cement floor.</p>

<p>Opening: "Wicked Mother-in-Law"</p>
<p>The continuous spring rain is depressing. Sitting alone at home, I think of idle stories. Speaking of a neighbor's wife in my hometown, the cruel abuse by her wicked mother-in-law is truly heartbreaking. She can hardly get enough to eat three meals a day. She can't get a good night's sleep. She works like a cow or a horse every day. She hardly has a moment to rest her hands and feet. She is ordered around like a servant. If she disobeys even slightly, she is beaten and scolded. Her whole body is beaten until it is bruised and swollen. She is not allowed to cry out in pain. What's more, the daughter and young uncle are truly hateful. They help the wicked mother-in-law to do evil. They secretly observe her actions like detectives. They fabricate stories to tell the mother. The wicked mother listens to her daughter's report. She creates trouble and stirs up disputes. Small beatings every three days become the norm. Big beatings every five days are unforgiving. Pitifully, she is a good wife, beautiful and intelligent. She has grievances but nowhere to complain. She can only weep secretly alone in her room. Sometimes she even has to be careful not to be heard. Pitifully, her husband is doing business far away. He has a new lover and has forgotten the old one. He doesn't care about the suffering of his virtuous wife at home. It is wrong of him to abandon the old and love the new. He only sees the smiles on the new woman's face. He doesn't see the tears of the old one. It is even more pitiful that this virtuous woman has a hard life. Both her parents are dead, and she has no relatives. She has tasted all kinds of cruelty from her wicked mother-in-law. She has no one to complain to about her grievances. I only hope that good and evil will eventually be repaid. Such a wicked mother-in-law will not have a good end. When death comes one day, she will not be able to carry out her cruelty. I want to advise the many mothers-in-law in the world. Do not be cruel and make a name for yourselves for evil. You should put yourselves in her shoes and think about how your own mother-in-law was. If your mother-in-law was cruel, I ask you, were you happy when you first became a wife? If your mother-in-law was truly kind, you should learn from her and treat others well. You should know that although a daughter-in-law has a different surname, she is ultimately related to you by blood. You should teach her politely when she is rude. Do not speak coldly or make many criticisms. There are many wicked mothers-in-law in the world. There are few virtuous wives in my hometown. I only hope that she can escape the sea of suffering and be reborn soon.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Two Newcomers in "The Goddess of Freedom"</h3>
<p>—Shi Chao and Lan Ping—</p>
<p>Last night, I had the privilege of seeing the preview screening of Diantong's new film "The Goddess of Freedom." I was deeply moved by the emotions of the entire play, and excited by the performances of each actor. Even the newcomer Shi Chao had an amazing performance. At the foot of the Bao Shu Pagoda, he chatted with Wang Ying, contrasting with his passionate indignation when he devoted himself to the revolution, and the tragic state of his death in the hospital. His trembling hands and mournful tones moved people's hearts and stimulated their vision. As for his fluent Mandarin, it gave people a pleasant feeling. In the voice film movement, he is a new member worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Lan Ping, she is a strong player in the drama world. This year, the two performances of Nora received a more satisfactory and glorious evaluation in terms of technique. This time, in "The Goddess of Freedom," although she appeared on the screen for the first time, playing a female soldier, although her role was small, it showed her identity. If compared with her performance as Nora, the former is a lively and cheerful little bird, while the latter is a mighty lion. One is relaxed and interesting, and the other is passionate and striving. Although the postures are different, the emotions are equally profound.</p>
<h3>Northwest Film Company Newsletter</h3>
<p>(1) The Northwest Company's new film "Long Live the Emperor" has returned to Bingzhou after shooting war scenes on location in the Niangziguan Yangquan area. This trip lasted a total of two weeks, shooting more than 5,000 feet of film, with excellent results.</p>
<p>(2) Northwest Company actor Wen Songkang plays the middle-aged Yan Xishan in "Long Live the Emperor." Not only does his appearance resemble Yan, but his performance is also excellent. When filming on location at Niangziguan, many of Yan's close associates came to visit, and all said that Wen's imitation of Yan's actions was extremely similar.</p>
<p>(3) The Northwest Company's new film "Ten Thousand Miles of Wind and Sand" has passed the initial review and has been submitted for re-examination.</p>
<p>(4) Shanxi has always been famous for its coal production. According to research, the coal reserves in Shanxi can supply the world for thousands of years. Recently, in order to strive for the production of educational films, the Northwest Company specially commissioned Mr. Song Yizhou to write a script with the Shanxi coal mine as the background (the title of the play has not yet been determined) in order to attract the attention of the Chinese people to the Shanxi coal mine.</p>
<p>(5) Since Ileidi joined the Northwest Company, he has received dozens of requests for photos every day. Since Ileidi cannot sign his name in Chinese characters, he has not replied for the time being. Now Ileidi has taken many photos and will personally sign his name in Chinese, which he recently learned, and distribute them to fans.</p>
<h3>"Naval Plot" Premieres</h3>
<p>"Naval Plot" is a double contribution from MGM, combining comedy, drama, and suspense. The tense action, terrifying emotions, and rich humor are exactly the stimulation that movie fans crave. It can also increase a lot of knowledge about military affairs. The leading actors are Robert Taylorqi, Spike, comedy star Tate Schelnard Panterden, Tom Dugan, etc. It is now premiering in Nanjing. The left is a scene from the film.</p>
