<p>時評</p>
<h3>意國之經濟恐慌</h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>國人恒以意大利在墨索里尼之統治下。其經濟狀况。必較其他國家穩定。近半年來意國對於東菲。整軍經武。雄心勃勃。尤使人有國力充實之感。故最近廢止金本位之一舉。實深足以引起吾人注意者也。</p>
<p>有人以爲意大利今次廢止金本位之行動。乃對阿軍事費用過大之結果。而二十三日羅馬電。則謂係最近意大利負欠外國貨欵五萬萬里拉之結果。然稍加考察。卽知此之二事。雖不失爲原因之一。然並非絕對之原因。尤非原因之原因。蓋意大利今次對阿動員軍費。至今尙不足十萬萬里拉。（據二十七日歐電稱。謂截至六月底止。爲九萬七千五百萬里拉）。爲數尙非甚大。不足爲今次廢止金本位之說明。推考其眞正原因。實在意大利國際貿易之逆超性上。至於財政預算之不能平衡。國債發行之繼長增高。失業人數之無法减少。金本位之不能維持。皆爲貿易逆超之結果。卽其對阿之軍事行動。亦大可視爲此種經濟狀况所促成者。</p>
<p>意大利向爲入超國家。其情形正與中國相似。所差者意國關稅完全自主耳。自墨索里尼主政以來。常以制北入超爲職志。然此種政策。若在物產豐富之國家。關稅苟能自主。行之固不甚難然。在煤鐵以及其他工業原料皆感缺乏之意大利行之。實爲一大難題。自墨索里尼厲行限止輸入。努力發展農產之後。入超雖見减少。有一時期國際收支。亦吿平衡。然自一九三〇年來。入超現象。又見復活。如自一九三一年以至一九三三年間之入超額。每年平均總在十四萬萬里拉左右。及至去年。則又突增至十七萬萬里拉。而本年度之首四個月。更達七萬五千三百萬里拉以上。依是觀測。至本年底統計時。甚數當在二十萬萬里拉以上。意大利每年入超。旣有如是之鉅。國民經濟自必受嚴重之打擊。而財政亦必首受影響。預算短少。在所難免。據歷年統計。意大利之預算短少。有不絕增加之勢。如一九三一—二年度短少數爲五萬七千六百萬里拉。一九三二—三年度增至三十三萬八千七百萬里拉。一九三三—四年度爲二十九萬萬里拉。一九三四—五年度增至二十九萬七千四百萬里拉。同時爲彌補此種預算之短少計。政府又不絕發行公債。故公債之數額。自一九二八年來。愈積愈大。如一九二八年。政府公債總額。爲八六·四一八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇里拉。至一九三四年十一月底增至一二八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇里拉。據最近估計。則已達於一五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇里拉之鉅。衡之意大利之國民經濟力量。實已達飽和點。此後非借外債。必致無法挹注。再則意大利失業人數。近年亦有增無减。就登記失業人數而言。近數年來常在一百萬左右。而一九二五年。意之失業人數。不過七萬餘人。兩相對照。實有令人不能置信者。然此數僅就登記者言。若包括不登記者。當在二百萬左右。觀此數點。可知墨索里尼。今次突然宣佈金本位之廢止。實爲打開經濟難關之必要手段也。</p>
<p>抑此次墨索里尼所以向阿比西尼亞耀武揚威。不惜出於一戰者。亦可謂爲經濟恐慌之影響。蓋對阿用兵。一則可以轉移國民之視綫。二則可以安挿國內之失業人員。三則戰爭順利。又可滿足意大利獲取原料擴大市塲之慾望。然軍事行動果能解决經濟恐慌乎。吾人姑拭目視之。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）海軍條約滿期之後、美國如何維持其太平洋之海軍優勢、實爲政府方面及海陸軍高級官員最注意之事、最近英國政府宣布、擬放棄比率制度、更使此項問題引起深切之興趣、目前此間官塲方面之一切討論皆嚴守秘密、故政府最後將取何種步驟尙未可知、惟數日來官塲方面稱、以前史汀生任國務總理之時、其主張爲比率問題與太平洋設防問題、　一者不可分離、現在局勢變遷、美國當須早日决定確切之海軍政策、所謂局勢之變遷、約有下列六端、（一）一切海軍限制取悄之後、海軍國家或將發生造艦競爭、（二）菲律濱之自主（三）日本之大事建造商船、（四）美國國會反對擴充美國商船之立法、（五）太平洋航空綫之卽將成立、（六）東京消息、日本或將於現有條約滿期之後、在太平洋各島佈設巡艦根據地、是故目前海陸軍方面最關心者、爲太平洋各島設防及增加商船二項問題、官塲方面大都皆以爲新約如不能成立、則國防問題將非常嚴重云、（廿八日國民電）</p>
<p>（東京）英國宣佈放棄海軍比率主義後、美國亦發聲明不固執比率主義、因而海軍軍縮會議、又有復開之希望、但日方對此新形勢不甚樂觀、外務省及海軍省當局、推斷其中必有重大意圖、或爲欲將軍縮會議失敗之責任推設日本身上、故日方將甚愼重對付新局勢云、（二十九日華聯電）</p>

<p>（二）海軍會商之召開委任英國處理、然英國忙於進行歐洲和平工作、現在祗有日美兩國之對立而已、且歐洲方面因認海軍協定無成立希望、對於日英美三國海軍預備會商及正式會議並未進行積極工作、</p>

<p>沈維挺詞　今日敝會敬備菲筵、歡宴各報記者、辱承諸公、不嫌溽暑、惠蒞賜敎、無任榮奉、今謹將維持國貨捲菸之旨趣、略陳一二、以求敎於諸公之前、竊查摔菸雖爲消耗品、但就一般的社會情形而言、其需要頗爲廣泛、故歐美諸邦、亦均風行一時、英美兩國、且爲著名出產菸葉區域、每年輸出捲菸及菸葉爲數頗鉅、佔有對外貿易之重要地位、是以政府從而提倡之獎勵之、以助長農村經濟之發展、至乎我國產菸區域、所在多有、其情形與英美相似、惟菸農往往墨守成法、不知改良、致質地稍遜、故爲復興農村計、菸葉固宜改良、而國貨捲菸、尤宜維持、質言之、維持國貨　菸、疋所以復興農村之經濟也、更就華商　菸廠業營業狀況而言、在最近的過去數年間已漸感不振、自本年二月以還、尤覺一落千丈、每况愈下，停工者時有所聞、即幸而開工者、亦因出品滯銷、岌岌可危、其一般的不景氣、可以想見、推究其　結所在、雖非一端、但外貨之跌價競銷、實爲最大原因、今華廠處此危境、支持彌感艱苦、若不一致奮起、共謀挽救、則來日大難、方興未艾、設不幸華廠全部崩潰、非特將捲菸營業權斷送以盡、抑使十餘萬工人同吿失業、即菸農生計、亦感恐慌、膽顧前途、不寒而悚、此國貨捲菸之亟待維持者又其一也、惟是維持之道、端賴羣策羣力、而宣傳倡導、尤爲要舉、至乎報紙實爲宣傳之利器、視三千毛瑟而過之、况滬埠爲全國輿論之中心、各報又風行乎全國、登高」一呼、足以移易社會之觀聽、今國貨捲菸、旣處　危地位、務請諸公、本其愛護實業、提倡國貨之熱忱、竭力贊助、廣爲宣傳、並希惠錫南針、匡其不逮、俾國貨捲菸之營業、得以發揚光大、則拜賜多矣、</p>
<p>袁　登詞　略謂、竊維國貨捲菸一業、五卅以後、頗有蓬勃之象、際茲世界不景氣潮流鼓盪所及，未免有今昔之感、在資方或尙可忍痛待時、在勞方恐即將不堪收拾、故今日之霄維待、誠爲烟廠工人方面計者多也、</p>
<p>王曉籟詞　略謂、今日國貨捲菸業之着手維持、猶之亡羊補牢、其計已末、燦爛光明之夢、徒成陳蹟、言之可惜、蓋余曾費幾許苦心於斯業、凡在同仁、咸知其底蘊者也、余遂憶及二十四初度、正當光復去辮之時、余本日需捲菸半聽而強、、是日並此捲菸之癮而革去焉、惟在吸烟之同胞、則必吸國貨捲菸、其維持母墮云云、</p>
<p>嚴獨鸛詞略謂、頃聆諸位偉論、悉極欽佩、若曉籍先生自述其戒捲菸之住事、尤足以身作則、持世人之能如其坐言起行者、不數數覯耳、即以鄙人個人言之、日需捲菸、吸量幾倍之、决志戒菸者、且歷五六度、而終無成效、以己度人、其相似於余、與曾不思戒者、固爲多數、則捲菸之爲社會需要、乃是事實、惟吸國貨捲菸、得大有裨益於菸農工、菸商猶其次焉、至新聞界爲國貨工商各業作宣傳、自其天職、不獨於國菸一業爲然也、新聞業固不能超然物表、必因國貨各業之繁榮而共榮焉、故吾報界爲國貨捲菸盡其宜傳之勞、甚樂爲之也、爰代報界同人、回敬一觴於國貨捲菸業、祝其漸由維持、而進於繁榮之境焉、</p>
<h3>上海防止霍亂　臨時事務所二號公吿</h3>
<p>（一）四星期前、本所會發表關于霍亂第一號公吿、迄今本埠及其他各處、尙無眞性霍亂發現、如南昌·蕪湖·九江·杭州·蘇州·寗波·等處患腸胃炎病人之糞樣、曾經細菌檢騐、但均証明爲非眞性、</p>
<p>（二）汕頭及厦門方面、繼續有疑似霍亂病例發生、七月六日、汕厦兩市／均各有死亡　例、但未經化騐證明眞性、本年至現在止、可謂無霍亂年、（三）七月十八日、本埠各報、載有本市發現眞性霍亂新聞一則、據謂華德路中國時疫醫院有眞性霍亂病人二名、均于數小時內治愈云云、經調查後、始悉全属子虛、</p>
<p>（四）揚子·黃河·兩流域大水泛濫、釀成巨災、因此有數種報紙、時有霍亂或將暴發之論調、但可謂絕無根據、蓋霍亂　名詞、係指有眞性霍亂菌（即郭　氏撇形菌）之傳染病而言、凡夏季之普通腸胃病、不得遽謂爲霍亂、以前因此項名詞之誤用、曾致我國商業交通上受一種非必要之束縛、並使我國被認爲惡疫發源地、</p>
<p>（五）本夏迄今高溫度爲華氏一百度·八、（七月十四日）及一百度·五、（七月十五日）去年最高溫度爲一百〇四度·四、（七月十二日）但本夏濕度甚高、平均每日達九十以上、去年則有數日均在九十以下、</p>
<p>（六）各區時疫醫院均已開幕、以防萬一、惟並無真性霍亂病人、即患普通腸胃病例亦不多、如西藏路時疫醫院迄今只用過鹽水注射四十次、華人與西人中暑死亡者、雖有數起、但中暑病例並不多見、</p>
<p>（七）衛生當局仍繼續努力設法防止覆亂及其他夏季病症之發生關於此事，有須言者、即智識階級、對於西瓜與蒼蠅傳佈疾病之事實、仍稍有誤解、以故土產瓜果、雖價廢物美、而過於小心之人、往往願以兩元代價、購買舶來水果、如購土產則化洋兩角足矣、有人以爲汚田內之瓜根、可以吸入細菌、殊爲過慮、蓋祗有切開之瓜果、洒以汚水、或經汚蠅及汚手之染及、始有傳染疫病之虞、且惟有染菌之蠅、方含危險性、</p>
<p>（八）受預防霍亂接踵之人數如下、上海市（至七月二十三日）二〇九一〇八、法租界（至七月二十五日）六二四四〇、公共租界（至六月三十日）八四八八三、兩路局衛生科（至五月三十一日）八五四三、共計四六四九七四人、</p>

<p>突又起火昨日八時半、於草屋均為易燃之物、傾刻即成燎原、無法收拾、當經楊家渡警所所長楊中權聞報、急電各救火機關呼援、面另派該所林楊兩巡官、分別　率長警、至火塲彈壓、不久、浦東區救火會主任趙龍生、率員驅車趕到施救、但該處小浜適值落潮、遍覓附近、並無滴水、使救火員束手無策、旋經商請北首大德新油廠接濟水力、　接數—丈皮帶、方得出水灌溉、</p>

<p>哀哭之聲當火起後、附近居民、扶老携幼、搶救什物、幸無受傷、但火塲內　係曲折小道、極難行走、加之觀者塞途、幸賴長警維持得力、災民分福康路·大慶街·草泥塘路·數處走出、沿途哀哭之聲、不絕於耳、厥狀至慘、</p>
<p>原因未明查此次起火原因、以及何家為禍首、因火起倉卒、該管警所一時無從查明、祗悉係工頭五某兼　一家、但亦難以證實、楊所長誠恐火首逃避他處、故候火熄後、先將王某查傅到案、冉憑訊究、</p>
<p>善後辦法是役計焚燒兩小時許、所燬草棚約三四百間、災民達千餘之衆、若　均係客籍平民、大都以碼頭小工為業、窮苦不堪、住屋被燬後、大半將無處容身、故善後辦法、頗為急要、聞楊所長仍將按照上次災後辦法、商請滬上各善團高潮救濟、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （俞慕古）</p>
<p>「戲法人人會變、各有巧妙不同。」吾人生存在這個世界上，一切的一切，那一件那一刻不是表演着戲法的勾當，因爲各有巧妙的不同，所以形成富貴貧賤悲歡離合種種階級的生活方式。</p>
<p>玩偶是小孩子所喜歡玩弄的東西。實則人們都喜歡玩弄小孩子，所以小孩子是人們的玩偶。而資本主義者喜歡玩弄人們，所以人們是資本主義者的玩偶。金錢喜歡玩弄資本主義者，資本主義老成爲金錢的玩偶。質言之，世界上一切人們，都是受金錢喜弄的玩偶。</p>
<p>「人心不同，各如其面。一但是人家的面目，可以用目力瞧得淸淸楚楚。人家的心，目力所不能窺探。自見的面，也可用鏡子照個一覽無遺，自己的心，鏡子也沒照見的可能。世人忽視此理，對於自己的心，尚不知怎樣形式，如何能專責人心的叵測呢？</p>
<p>電影一幕幕映着，而至於終了，使觀衆發生無限的感想與批判。吾人的生活，亦正如表演電影，一幕幕過去，而至於終了的死，要惹動多少人的戚想與批判。所以吾人在生前，先要想到死後，爲感想與批判的多少人，打算一下。</p>
<h3>悼惲鐵樵先生</h3>
<p>— 田舍翁</p>
<p>田舍翁曰：文章每與世運爲轉移，獨孤常州，承六朝靡麗之後，而出以和平溫厚。歐陽於五季擾亂之餘，亦以和平出之；皆足以輓救頹俗者也。遜淸光緒季年，一二憂國之士，頗有以小說轉移風俗之志，若吳研人，李伯元，王元生，林琴南，蔣景緘，陳冷血，包天笑，許伏民諸君，皆以小說　於時。小說林月月小說，商務繡像小說停刊後，狄平子瓶辦小說時報，王西神創小說月報，此光宣間事也。</p>
<p>當是時，小說時報中，刊載美大小說家却爾司佳維名著荳蔻葩，黑衣孃，波痕荑茵三長篇，旖旎香艷，能移我情；迻譯者，武進惲鐵樵先生也。淸社既屋，說報蠭起，餖　堆垜，號爲鴛鴦蝴蝶派，識者譏之。當是時，惲先生操小說月報選政，立矯堆砌之弊，譔譯說部，淸絕滔滔，與荳蔻葩，黑衣孃等之纖麗，迥然兩派。夫亦見瓦釜雷鳴，移風易俗，匪此末由歟？當時有詆先生小說爲「大說」者，以予論之，若先生者，實當時小說界之馬丁路德也。</p>
<p>惲先生，諱樹珏，字鐵樵，又署冷風，焦木，江蘇武進人，淸畫家南田老人後裔也。淸季，畢業南洋公學，故西文頗有根底。其譯小說，以淸麗之筆，達纏綿之情，若　蔻葩，黑衣孃，出山泉水諸篇，讀者莫不嘆賞。先生以子女多病，深以未諳醫學爲憾，迺遍議國醫典籍；久之，頗有心得。用科學方法以整理國醫典籍，實自先生始。</p>
<p>惲氏醫學湛深，心得甚富，自懸壺後，就診者靡不霍然而愈，以是戶限爲穿。而先生沉潛醫學，孜孜勿懈，暇則以著作自娛，至今醫學著作，裒然巨帙；論者莫不以翳學家目之，寗知先生固一小說家也。</p>
<p>先生衰病已久，近以不堪溽暑，病勢轉劇，突於前日逝世，年五十有八。自前月曾孟樸氏（東亞病夫）死後，先生又以逝世聞，小說家又弱一個，豈僅國醫界之不幸哉！</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>李士廉道，求佛求尊，何必去東拉西扯。現在張先生闊起來了。你讓他隨便帮你一點忙，那就行了。楊浣花笑道；我是有耳朶的，早已聽到有個中央大員要來，和他沾親呢。便把眼珠斜轉着，看到介夫的臉上去。介夫揚着眉毛道：若論替你想一點小法子呢，過了明日，或者不難。浣花道；爲什麼要過了明天呢？明天就是個大發財源的日子嗎？介夫道；你沒聽見說藍專員明天要到嗎？他是我的親戚。他來了，少不得有許多事要派我去作。自然，叫我作事，當然，有銀錢由我手上經過，那時，我在大批的欵項裏面，移動一點小欵子給你用，那是不值什麼的。浣花道；你不知道我明天一早就要走嗎？若是等你明天給錢，帶我到潼關去的汽車，趕不上，我又得拿出好幾塊錢來買票，那還是不合算。介夫淡淡的笑道；我也不過處於朋友的地位，帮點忙。天下事那裏有面面都到的，那就只好聽憑你自己去挑選了。浣花聽他說話的口音，並不能有什麼切實的表示，這給我錢的事，似乎沒有什麼多大的希望，因之站若呆了一呆。張介夫好像是很忙，並沒有功夫說閑話，扭轉身體，就向他自己屋子裏走去。李士廉緊緊的跟隨在後面，也去了。這廊子下面，就剩了一個楊浣花。他能夠弄到一張火車票錢，還是張介夫說的好話，要不然賈多才把朱月英已經弄到了手，他就過河拆橋，也沒有他的法子。（二七七）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>黃河，誰都知道是一條極不平安的河流，每年總得給它釀成幾處很重大的水災；這一年，照例又鬧出來了，沿岸一帶的百姓，自然又得鬧着饑荒和疫癘了。淹死的人，總在二三千以上，還有五六千人是全部都成了無家可歸的哀鴻。本來朝廷方面對於這種每年必須發生的災荒，原也有些預備的，可是這一年的災情特別的重，原來預備下的一些賑欵和糧食，絕對不夠分配，頓教那些辦脤的官員弄得手忙脚亂，不知所措起來，沒法只得從實申報上來。依着朝廷上住日的規矩，無論什麼事情總不免有許多的躭擱，先必發交軍機處閱過，再由軍機處轉發給該管的衙門去核議，核議了多時，再辦奏稿，請旨定；這樣往遝遞送，常有躭擱到一月兩月的事情。那日太后接到了災情重大，賑欵不敷的奏報之後，却一反歷來陋習，竟毅然央然的親自提起筆來，批了幾句，立刻交給戶部去，要他們火速籌撥幾十萬兩庫銀，專充救濟黃災的用處。伊還恐他們不能了解伊的苦心，未必會十分誰力，因又另外專俞出去說：</p>
<p>（只要眞是爲着救災而用的，我們連一個錢都不應該省；如共庫上沒有充分的現銀，一時無從調撥的話，我自己的私產也極願捨施出來。我們務必要把這件事做到一個比較圓滿的結果！」（三七七）</p>

<h3>妻子的買賣</h3>
<p>— 殷憶秋</p>
<p>人物：程彩珍（拜金主義的女人）劉宏祥（富商）老張（法院庭丁）法官三人律師二人法警二人旁聽者若干人</p>
<p>地點：法庭</p>
<p>幕開：（將近開審的時候，老張坐在公案下面，原告律師走去報到，二人爲素識，隨便談起來）</p>
<p>老張：潘律師你早啊！</p>
<p>律師：時間已經到了，推事還沒有到嗎？</p>
<p>老張：到了，馬上就要開庭了！</p>
<p>律師：今天這件案子才有趣，一個非常美麗的女人，要求一個十分醜陋的男子承認。伊是妻子。</p>
<p>老張：我猜這個男子一定會承認伊的。</p>
<p>律師：承認了伊還用打官司嗎？傻子！</p>
<p>老張：唉！天下眞有這樣不公平的事！一個漂亮的女人，要求做他的妻子，還會不承認嗎？</p>
<p>律師：老張！你嘆什麼窮氣？難道你這般年紀，還沒有老婆嗎？</p>
<p>老張：不瞞你說……我的老婆那才眞漂亮哩，就是因爲我窮，在六年以前，跟人逃走了！</p>
<p>律師：你當時沒有找尋嗎？</p>
<p>老張：就因爲尋找伊，我才從北平到了上海，在那個時候，我眞像瘋了一樣，茶飯都辨不出滋味，時時刻刻老是想着伊！</p>
<p>律帥：後來怎麼樣呢？</p>
<p>老張：唉！不要提起！到今天整整地過了六個年頭，竟會音息全無！</p>
<p>律師：女人變起心來可眞快，我說那個女人也太沒有良心了！（程彩珍上劉宏祥偕律師上旁聽者絲續上）</p>
<p>老張：庭長到（全塲起立致敬空氣嚴肅）</p>
<p>（推事翻閱卷宗，法警引彩珍入原告欄，宏祥站被告欄，老張正坐在彩珍的背後，十分驚異的注視着伊的背影，）</p>
<p>推事：你呌程彩珍嗎？</p>
<p>彩珍：是的。</p>
<p>推事：你幾歲？那裏人？</p>
<p>彩珍：二十八歲，北平人！</p>
<p>推事：你爲什麼要告劉宏祥？</p>
<p>彩珍：因爲他不承認我是妻子！</p>
<p>推事：你什麼時候嫁給他的？</p>
<p>彩珍：我二十二歲那年嫁給他的，起光，他待我還好，從民國十七年冬季起，對我日形冷淡，把我遺棄到如今，現在他發了財了，竟喪了良心，不准我進他的大門，請庭長救濟！</p>
<p>推事：劉宏祥！</p>
<p>宏祥：是。</p>
<p>推事：幾歲？那一裏人？</p>
<p>宏祥：三十六歲，上海人！</p>
<p>推事：做什麼生意？</p>
<p>宏祥：開綢緞莊。</p>
<p>推事：剛才程彩珍的話你聽淸嗎？你的意見一怎麼樣？</p>
<p>宏祥：我不承認伊是妻子，因爲俘並沒有和我結過婚！不過在五年前有過一度姘居關係，那個時候，我還是綢緞店的一個小夥計，伊嫌我窮，另外愛上了一個人走了，現在看我的境况好了點，又來和我糾緾，我决不能承認！</p>
<p>（這時，老張的一切慘痛的往事，都湧現在腦海）</p>
<p>原告律師：現在事實巳經證明，原告和被告是有夫妻關係的，請庭長確認原告爲被告之妻！</p>
<p>被告律師：根據民事訴訟二零八條請庭長駁回原告之訴！</p>
<p>老張：（情緒緊張）好下賤的女人！（程彩珍突見老張驚慌失措）</p>
<p>法警：老張！你昏了嗎？這是什麼地方？</p>
<p>老張：（瘋了似的）潘律師！伊就是我的老婆！（將彩珍扭住）你跟我回去！</p>
<p>彩珍：誰是你的妻子？</p>
<p>老張：好沒有良心的女人，我爲了你差一點兒病死！……</p>
<p>法官：（震怒）這個人瘋了，把他攆出去！</p>
<p>彩珍：庭長！我不認識他！</p>
<p>老張：（被二法警挾住）好不要臉的女人！拿做買賣的手叚來嫁丈夫，有錢的，不是你的主顧，硬去拉！沒有錢的，明明是你的主顧，推出門去！我不能吃你的肉也得剝你的皮……</p>
<p>法警：別多嚕囌！出去！出去！</p>
<p>老張：我不出去怎麼樣？</p>
<p>法警：（強推老張）滾！滾！滾！</p>
<p>老張：我偏不出去！我偏不出去！</p>

<h3>紗花　流言利多　花紗再驚人漲風　遠期紗近月花逼近八十元卅六元關</h3>
<p>紗市趨堅、且漲風越漲越有勁、此種情形、完全紗廠受經濟困難、停閉者益衆、生產大减、客帮對於倉庫之存紗、首先搬運、於是人心激動、近日市塲流言繁雜、通貨問題、異常濃烈、而本月份且有多頭公司組織、一般空頭、遂發現極大恐慌、市盤乃暴漲五元外、遠月迫近一百八十元大關矣、</p>
<p>鷄一跳五元餘</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月漲風尚綏、但塲中新賣者未旺、後聞標金趨漲、形勢突緊、且某方而仍大量的購進、對於本月份有多頭公司組繳、拍至收盤、某廠主在遠月不限價大枇購進、以致檯面忽緊、賣戶缺乏、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元五六角至二元八九角、午後開盤、塲中議論粉紜、皆屬利於多頭、本月份價多空兩方相持不下、狂喊呌至一百八十元、後以價高有吐出、略見回下、但賡豐頭盤狂購八百五十包、遠月盤盤向上、步開步漲、形勢頗緊、結果各月比上午收盤價又漲二元三角至三元六·八·角、查賣出裕康一千包、益大五百五十包、穗隆七百五十包、達記四百五十包、新昌二千包、明德六千四百五十包、合興二千一百五十包、瑞大一千三百五十包、均昶一千二百五十包、森康七百包、慎記一千二百包、潤康二千七百五十包、泰昌一千三百包、長豐一千五百五十包、買進明華一千六百五十包、大孚二千八百包、通記四千八百五十包、振大九百包、賡豐四千九百包、大昌成九百包、泰昌一千二百五十包、長豐八百包、恒昌四千一百包、慎昌一千六百包、生源八百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>鄭標激漲一元三角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各有漲氣未熾、拍至二三盤、開金市上漲、且市塲謠諑紛紛、謂通售膨脹之傳極厲、買風大熾、收盤時遠月漲力愈銳、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲六角半至八九角、午後開盤、因紗市狂騰、漲勢益激、一般浮空、急於抵補、市價步開步挺、標金又穿出九十元外、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲三·四·五·六角、查賣出長豐五千六百擔、同興一千七百擔、昶記一千七百擔、大孚一千七百擔、同孚三千七百擔、通記四千三百擔、大豐二千四百擔、源大二千擔、明德三千七百擔、瑞大四千擔、大昶二千三百擔、永大二千八百擔、益豐二千八百擔、永昌二千七百擔、長和三千八百擔、買進生源三千二百擔、潤康四千七百擔、裕大一千七百擔、大孚一千九百擔、賡豐一千八百擔、大昌成三千七百擔、長豐四千三百擔、恒昌二千七百擔、長和五千擔、穗隆三千八百擔、達記二千二百擔、均昶三千擔、源興昌二千九百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>證劵　七月份公債交割槪况　交割數四千三百三十九萬　各種游資集中於公債市塲　市價由低紀錄而轉直上</h3>
<p>昨二十九日、爲華商證券交易所七月份期貨公債交割之期、雖在河北事件以後、並受各種環境之壓迫、內政外交之拮據、難關重重、而備現收貨者、仍甚踴躍、計七月份交割數仍有四千三百三十九萬、內除各經紀人多空相抵、自行交割者、一千九百六十六萬、在交易所交割者、計一千四百十三萬、塲外交割者、數尚不祗此、故在表面上觀察、每以爲環境情形之惡劣而放出、但自華北事件以後、申津兩埠金融界之不健全、加以水災之鉅、愈令人不寒而慄、空方藉此頑抗、但因此各帮對於投資、漸有無所適從之槪、實業旣已凋弊、銀錢業尤難發展、各種游資、乃得漸漸集中於公債市塲、七月十一日、津埠發生風潮、市上更有債息减低之謠、人心極度恐慌、發現時、鹽稅跌七元四角、栽兵跌七元七角半、金短跌九元一角、迨後謠言已過、河北事件解决、初以空頭擁濟而回好、繼以散戶吸收及大戶由空翻多而上漲、最後屆七月份期貨、行將終了時、忽有金鎊借欵之謠、更有銀行紙幣準備、現金部份、由六成减爲四成、通貨之說、尤屬甚　塵上、而劇漲甚勁、與五月卅日高價相較、祇差三左右而已、但目下人心尚堅、暫尚不易遽小、九六公債、在各債市驚濤駭浪中、仍能獨立而緊漲、則完全受一部份之扶持、前途尚未可厚非也、茲將七月份期貨交割　帳及其總成交數、分別列表於後、（單位百元）</p>
<h3>糧食　粉麥漲後卽回</h3>
<p>粉市初漲繼跌、形勢頗見混亂、以洋麥報價、芝加哥續漲一元零之巨、坎拿大漲六角零、利物浦漲兩辦士零、故開價後、各月份人心、均一致騰貴、計近好二分左右、遠漲一分、初開交易、異常旺暢、迨至二盤以後、人心又忽漸軟因大廠對各月份之拋售、頗見猛烈、一部分之浮多、亦趁勢了結、是以市氣遂逐步軟下、半日中之交易、達七十餘萬包、亦爲市面沉寂以來之僅見者、觀白銀問題之謠傳不一、金價反未見鬆、故客戶心思、仍趨穩定、結果本月份仍好七厘半、八九月份不動、十月份小半分、十一月份反跌一分半、十二月份跌一分云、</p>
<p>麥市昨呈初振繼平之象、初以洋麥報價續漲、金價亦復續躍、故各月份初盤、曾漲一二四分不等、至二盤以下、逐步鬆疲、因粉市由高而低、又有一部分行家之洋麥套貨、趁勢出　、故穩定之際、不免略受打擊、不過此種情形、恐亦係一時之衝動、往後如無現洋麥之傾銷、業中人均看穩站耳、結果八月份好一分、九月份小一分、十月份不動、十一月份小一分、現麥市面、因客戶扳售、產地亦未鬆宜、各檔喊價又提三五分、開烏衣麥三五角、次至四角半、洋河瑤灣麥三元六角、次五角六分、湖熱麥三元四角三分、五河麥三元五角一分、高資六合揚州鎮江麥一元四角半、次四角、江新洲麥三元五角二分、丹陽麥三元四角七分、江北麥三元五角二分、至船麥如唯亭崑山支塘等、高貨三元五角、次四角、由福新去八千包、申大去三千包、信大去二千包云、</p>

<h3>杜洋米又見上漲</h3>
<p>本米（滬南）昨各帮來源又稀、祇到七八號、（貨共千五六百石）、市况自經前市一番騰升後、昨則開手猶有餘波、惟零躉兩胃則較前俱懈、是其午時形勢已見遜色、而結果各貨行情雖尚賴到稀續升、然究屬環境虛弱、後若到源一夥、或即難以立足、計包胃祇烟臺帮辦百四五十包、而各厚粳及薄稻價悉增一二角不等、陰元定局、東新亦無軒輊、（滬北）昨日河下各路來船約七八號、河下存船五六十艘、市上銷路白梗早市零拆續交、致又加一二角、至收盤零拆稍轉呆滞、東新便到百餘石、零星交易續化、市價定勢、早薄稻去胃尚佳、價形加起角許、白元零胃滯細、價小角外、其餘花色無甚上落、</p>
<p>洋米昨市復見博機、實因目下全滬存底逐减、後到已絕、而成本高昂、貨主均不願貶價賤脫、一經本客銷路活潑、市面立即轉升、一昨日河下米已經回漲、囤戶心思隨即向上、河下米既漲、本街多注意於洋米、內地雖無暢胃、然九江漢口北洋各帮均有辦裝、本街胃口最貪、各洋米售價立即飛升一角、全日開出西貢米八千七百包、小絞一千五百包、暹羅·敏黨·等一千四百包、統計開出一萬一千六百包、後由亦爲看好矣、</p>
<h3>贛城門荳亦已登塲　—價開三元九角—</h3>
<p>九江新豆第二批上市者爲城門豆、但爲數甚微、祇十五包、出品尙佳、惜身骨較江橋豆見軟、價開二元九角、由本街小磨及菜擔戶分去、後批能否蟬聯、暫時小有把握、陳豆市氣依然平疲、因去路不暢、且在新貨登場之候、市况不免軟弱、豆餅交易尚續、價市相妨、</p>
<h3>南北貨　湘蓮續漲木耳回跌　生仁收歉開價步漲</h3>
<p>湘蓮　近以地價步緊、將近四十元、而收成因水患受損甚重、故申市人心極佳、逐步向上、開頂莊湘潭蓮有售過五十餘元之說、普通亦需四十五元云、</p>
<p>木耳　漢市軋缺見漲、本難持久、昨據函訊、途貨有二三百包不日可到、因此辦價已回鬆二元、後防續鬆、</p>
<p>生仁　近以收成告歉、而靑島亦漲、兼之申市價巳低廉、一經衡動、漲勢當亦必勁、昨廣帮進意甚濃、號貨碭山仁較高者要六元三角、還二角、尚在接合中、普通郊仁六元六角、巳有成交、市看再緊、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵糖定期照常標售</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金更堅、趨勢復見向上、公會劇盤、二四粗砂白現貨呌十六元三角半、轉口貨四元八角、均未成交、惟本棧貨劃過十六元四角、比升五角、本廠綿白以原料既升、因亦呌高、一號喊十五元六角未成、國產潮靑以汕頭辦理登記、停止出口、後市防漲、故申市號貨昨亦喊升、零星稍有成交、上落有限、正綿赤開出七八十包、十一元四角、枝洋數十包十二元四角、比升一二角、東白呌升五六分未成、</p>
<p>糖業合作公司自粗白降價以來、因難合劃、存糖久無標售、聞昨已通告同業、自八月二日起每逢星期一三五日仍照常標售、蓋糖市已見起色也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　秋冬毛貨　川帮提先採辦</h3>
<p>秋冬時令之毛織物、近來續有到埠、同業中因之皆相繼開盤、四川帮首見索樣問訊、蓋其路遠、故歷年來皆提早採購、昨頭號人字大衣呢、躉批開盤價每碼爲六元七角半、副號五元半、普通四元二角半、咪吔利豐昌明麥高之次號人字毛花呢、開售二元八角、並通頭號馬褲呢、均開售七元一角半、一萬八千號啥味開售五元半、四萬一千號花呢開售四元七角半、麥爾登大半均開售二元四角、寶達格子爛糊呢原包子開價一元一角、</p>

<h3>陳舊的話</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>撤去了宗教家眼中的　障，則我們就可知道宗教家所崇奉的上帝或神祇，並不是人類的佑護者。如果神祇是自然的人格化，那末人類是與自然對立的。這種對立的觀念，在各民族初期傳說中，就存在着。</p>
<p>據各民族初期傳說，最初的統治者，總是神，或介乎神與人之間的人，或神的子孫。而那些敬事神祗的大多數人，都是神祇用特種物質造成的。在希伯萊有上帝用塵土造人的傳說，在中國也有黃土搏人的神話，在北美的Seminoles與Choctaw部落中，也有「生命之神」用泥土造人的神話。這些「芻狗」不如神祇造成的賤民，自然隨造物者的喜怒而使之存在或淘汰。在太古的時候，事實上也許曾有一次汎濫全世界的洪水，因而洪水的傳說普遍於各民挨中。一切宗教家就利用這種傳說，爲其說教的資料。舊約中說：「耶和華見人在地上罪惡很大，終日所思想的盡都是惡。耶和華就後悔造人在地上，心中憂傷。耶和華說；「我要將所造的人，……都從地上除滅。」在南美巴西TupjGuaran這部落中，也有相類似的故事，那就是創造神Monan覺得人類太壞，就决定用火來燬滅世界。大術士Irin　Mape爲救人類，降雨以滅火，結果造成汎濫的洪水。古希臘亞斯奇勒斯（Aeschylus）的悲劇樸羅米塞斯被縛（Prometheur　Bound）中，也有這樣的故事，說到南斯立意要毀滅人類，另創造一個新種族，樸羅米塞斯，這位巨人，爲愛護人類，將火偷送給人類，因而觸了宙斯之怒，被鎖於高加索的岩石上。</p>
<p>這一切傳說，都表明人與自然是站在對立的地位，沒有調和的餘地，不是人利用自然，征服自然，就是人被自然征服，人被自然毀滅。所以那些返歸自然論者，或者與自然調和論者所認爲理想的世界：「至德之世，其行填填，其視顛顛；萬物羣生，速屬其鄉，禽獸成羣，草木逐長。是故禽獸可係覇而遊；鳥鵲之巢而攀援而　，……」决不是一個極樂的世界。舊約創世紀中所說的亞當夏娃住的伊甸樂園，也不過是宗教家一種欺人的寓言。反之，人類的女祖夏娃的受了蛇的誘引，摘下了智慧之果與亞當共同吃了，因此『眼睛也明亮了』。爲了這件事被上帝逐出樂園，『終身勞苦，纔能從地上得吃的。』這正說明了人類的向上，而决不是人類的墮落。所以密爾頓在他的失樂園替亞當夏娃所悲咏的幾句：</p>
<p>『地球的內臟也在戰抖了，似乎又在絞痛；自然又第二次呻吟天空下垂，隆隆的雷聲，幾點慘澹雨點，哭泣着這凡人最初的罪惡！』</p>
<p>我們也可以反過來講，地球的戰抖，自然的呻吟，天空的下垂，正是一切自然界，對於人類向之征服的恐懼，並不是自然界替人類犯罪的恐懼。神宰制的世界的必須破滅，以及神的對於人類的畏懼，連神的說教者，也早已感覺到。舊的創世紀中說：洪水以後，『天下人的口音言語，都是一樣。他們從東邊遷移的時候，在示拿地遇見一片平原，就住在那裏。他們彼此商量說：『來吧，我們要作甎。一把甎燒透了，他們就要拿甎當石頭，又拿漆當灰泥。他們說：『來吧，我們要建造一座城，和一座塔，塔頂通天，爲要傳揚我們的名，免得我們在地上。』耶和華降臨要看世人所建的城和塔。耶和華說，「看哪，他們成爲一樣的人民，都是一樣的言語，如今旣作起這事來，以後他們所要作的事，就沒有不成就的了。我們下去，在那裏變亂他們的口音，使他們的言語，彼此不通。」於是耶和華使他們從那裏分散在全地上，他們就停工不造那城了。」</p>
<p>這意義正說明了自然所加於人類的威力與人類征服自然的企圖。</p>
<p>在同樣意義下，上述的希臘悲劇撲羅米修斯被縛中，樸羅米修士，這位人類的保鏢者，爲保護人類，教人造屋，教人認識四季，教人認識生產，教人製造文字，教人用牛耕種了，教人醫藥的智識，教人團結，教人使用鐵　金屬等，以與自然的威力反抗，柔弱的人類獲得了這樣的武器，終有一天將宇宙的主宰，新興的暴君宙斯，從那光榮的寶座上推倒。</p>
<p>亞斯哥勒斯還有兩部以同樣人物爲劇中主角的而現已喪失的悲劇，一部叫做給火者與樸羅米塞斯被釋，據說後一劇中樸羅米塞斯，並沒有像樸羅米塞斯被縛一中所說一樣遭遇他預定的命運，而遭滅亡，而樸羅米塞斯自己，也終於與宙斯和解了。英國詩人雪萊，對於這樣的結局，不大滿意。於是他也創作一個詩劇叫做樸羅米塞斯被釋。雪萊在這劇本的序言中說：『我對於人類保鏢者與人類壓迫和解這樣一個結局很討厭。這寓言的道德的意義，本由樸羅米塞斯的痛苦與忍耐所支持的，如果我們認爲他在他的仇敵前　服。那意義就完全消滅。」因此在他的劇中，宙斯終於走上他的滅亡的命運，而人類也總於達到「無偶像的自由的，不受限制的平等的「階級的境界」，這樣在雪萊的劇中，又有另一種意義存在了。</p>
<h3>失眠的一晚（上）</h3>
<p>— 龍在田</p>
<p>柯諒夫爲了兩個月以來的神經衰弱，就輾轉遷徙到了離城六十里以外的T鎮去休餐。T鎮是以有溫泉著名的，在一個沒有到過那兒的人，多半是會慷憬着一幅美妙如畫的景色吧。但事實上：山是那們地渺小，不需十分鐘就可能繞行一周，而且是濯濯的一座牛山；靠北的一部分，不錯的還有百多株的黑松，但那是栽植不久的，還沒成蔭；民房是那們地簡陋；街道是那們地　　與凌亂……</p>
<p>柯諒夫所住的地方，也還沒有裝電燈，兼之夏夜的鄉村的蚊虫所予人們的騷擾是夠可驚的，因此他就在漫漫的黑夜還沒有完全把黃昏的地位佔領以前的星稀時，就靜靜地爬到他獨自的臥室裏躺着了。</p>
<p>當他剛一上床時，原頗有倦意，大概好夢是就會跟着來似的。因爲炎炎的長夏，他從不曾睡到過一回午覺，尤其近來，他爲求一個甜密的憇睡，在薄暮時，老在山前山後獨個子作一小時左右的散步，確也有些疲憊了，但他剛一合上眼，莫明的，又跟往常一樣，一切不快意的思緒，正跟帳外可厭的蚊虫似的，又飛集上來了。</p>
<p>先前他還坦然，故意悠閒地搔搔腮，爬爬耳，望望帳頂，有時思索些平生得意的事跡，來壓伏這些不快，雖然，爲了年齒還小，得意的事跡太少，不上幾分鐘，這霎那的欣慰，又曇花似的凋零，而騰着依然的萬斛愁城，這便翻一個身。也有時想些近乎淫佚的記憶；有時更想些距離可能極遠的空想，然而拗不過的是事實，一個爲了他大哥與三妹發生意外不幸後的，到處求神問下，愁眉不展的他那媽媽的蒼白的臉，又幌在他的眼前了。翻一個身，就像蚊虫經驅遂以後，飛遠一點，但一下又飛回來了！</p>
<p>而且這時候的思緒，方弗眞鑽到了牛角尖裏，無論怎樣的打　也盆不開。房外：康雨與李美娜也早躺着了。而康雨在息燈以前，更照例的打着四川腔，譏刺似的照呼他一句：</p>
<p>「柯諒夫還裝死嗎？眞睡着了？」</p>
<p>他怕一經允答以後，會愈盆刺激起神經的興舊，於是也照例地答復他一個沉默。但不由的一陣煩燥，接着便又照例地開始數起一二三四五……的數目字來，雖然也明知是無效的。</p>

<h3>侮辱</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>電車給聲叮叮的響着，停在一個站台上，琳擕着她的綢傘和錢包下了車。</p>
<p>迎面一家商店裏無綫電話的播音引起了她的注意，她拾起頭來望，櫥窗裏嵌着的鏡片淸淸楚楚的映出了她美麗的臉，臉是紅紅的，充滿了憤怒，額上微微沁出了一些汗珠。</p>
<p>琳本能地抽出手帕來，拭去了額上的汗，同時在電車上的一剎那印象，又在她眼前顯現了出來。</p>
<p>這眞是太豈有此理了，人們怎麼竟把女性在社會上的地位看得這樣低！難道女性便沒有獨立的人格，應該供大衆玩弄的嗎？她覺得這在車上的十幾分鐘時間，是她畢生難忘的一個恥辱。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：早上在宿舍裏，失手把惟一的一隻漱口盂打碎了，同時常用的毛巾也有幾分污舊，日用品和化妝品有幾種也需要添置，爲了這以上的原因，使得素來不喜歡出門的琳，也不得不勉強出外去購買了。</p>
<p>天氣是異樣的熱，馬路上的柏油都被太陽融化了，黃包車夫都乘機拾高了他們出賣勞力的價值，短短的一段路程，討價却總在兩毛以上，這是受經濟環境限制的琳所坐不起的。爲了節省一些費用起見，她只得撑着綢傘，走到離學校有百餘步路的電車站去等車。</p>
<p>站在烈日之下，等候那遙遠的車子開來，這况味是很難受的。好容易盼着車到了，偏偏上落的人又非常擠軋。琳耐心地等所有的人都上去了，才踏上車級去。這時，車鈴響着，車已經開動了，琳使勁向上一跳，沒有跳上，心裏很是着急。幸得那站在車門邊的賣票人在她臂上拉了一把，才把她拉上車來。她起初很感謝他，但當一抬頭，望到那賣票的喀開的嘴和乘客們詭異的笑臉時，她才明自自己是被人輕薄了。這意外的侮辱使她憤怒，但她又能怎樣呢？她只有勉強忍耐着，走進車廂裏去。</p>
<p>車廂裏已坐得沒有隙地了，連藤圈上都吊滿了人，琳只得將身靠在車門上，站久了的腿使她漸漸感覺支持不住。這時，忽然有一個穿着漂亮西裝的靑年立起身來向她讓座，琳毫不遲疑的領受了他的好意，同時並投給他一瞥感謝的眼光。她覺得，中國人到底還有幾個有禮貌的。</p>
<p>這靑年就站在琳面前，眼光不時溜到她面上來。琳也不在意，自顧取出錢來買票。但漸漸的，她感覺有些異樣了，在她的膝蓋上，感到一種重壓，一個異性的笑險向她誘惑着，正是讓座給她的靑年。同時，那賣票人送過票來時，又有意無意地碰了碰她的手指。這種種的侮辱，使她的感情裏充滿了憤怒，她一聲不響的跳起身來，仍舊站着，讓　車把她的身體戰到目的地去。</p>
<p>過去的印象一一在琳眼前展開，深刻的悲哀蛇一樣的咬住她的心，她想到婦女運動的口號在中國喊了也巳有十幾年了，而還不能把社會上的人們對女性輕蔑玩視的心理改正過來，這到底是誰的過失呢？她懊悔先前不該吝階小費，不乘了黃包車來。</p>
<p>但過去的巳經過去，除了受一些侮辱以外，並沒有損失什麼，儘可不必再去想牠了。於是，她便又心平氣和的走進那商店裏去。</p>
<p>電風扇在她頭上輕快地轉動着，凉風習習的向她身上吹來，她所有的憤怒全都給風吹散了，興會重又颼舉起來。她很耐煩的從這一部定到那一部留心尋找着她所需要的物品，一種式樣玲瓏的電玉器皿把她的眼光吸引住了，她忍不住從裏面揀選了一隻漱口孟，向櫃毫裏的男店員問着：</p>
<p>『喂！這個賣多少錢？』</p>
<p>『五角六！』那店員用輕佻的聲口說，同時向琳扮了一個鬼</p>
<p>琳有些躊躇了，費這許多錢，買一隻漱口孟，未免太過奢侈。但仔細把玩着這玲瓏的器皿，又覺不忍釋手。於是，她便冒險作了一下還價的嘗試。</p>
<p>『三角錢賣嗎？』</p>
<p>『哼！三角錢，只好買……哈哈！……』那店員輕簿地笑着，回過頭去，在他身旁的另一個店員也怪聲地笑了。</p>
<p>琳不禁大怒了起來，對着顧客，而且是一個少女，竟敢施用這樣無賴的口吻，這是無論如何不能容許的，她眞想劈面打那店員兩記耳光。但看到兩旁的人，想到自己總是偭女性，不論在那一方面都不能和人爭勝，便只有忍氣吞聲的放下了漱口孟，走出那商店去。</p>
<p>終於還是在一家用着女店員的商店裏，買了她所要買的東西。雖然那女店員在做着交易時面色非常冷淡，但在琳的心裏却安寗了許多。她輕輕噓一口氣，覺得這　天侮辱和受罪的生活總算告一段落了。</p>

<h3>大學時代（三三）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>我不知道爲甚麼聽見這話會嚇了一跳。我正要向這吹牛大王打聽下去，但忽然想起剛才出門時曾見跛脚瑪麗在房東底側房裏坐着。</p>
<p>我立刻動身回家，半點鐘之後就站在她旁邊同她交談起來了。</p>
<p>『你好久沒有看見雷娜麗了麼？」我問。</p>
<p>她沉默了一會。「我現在不同她一起做針綫生意了，』她說，眼睛祇注視她的工作。</p>
<p>『你們本來是很好的朋友啊！』</p>
<p>『本來麼，是的！』—她用指甲在剛縫好的綫路上擦了一會。『但自從她在郊外同大學生們跳舞之後……。他現在已不常在老姨母家裏了；遺囑上恐怕也要變動了。』</p>
<p>『呵，原來有這回事！』我想—克里斯多夫動身不久便把借去的錢寄還我，祇簡單附了幾句話，說他在舅父家裏很受歡迎，二老和他們的半老的女兒都喜歡他，他工作很忙。</p>
<p>自此以後我就沒有聽見他以及娜麗底消息。</p>
<p>『可是，怎麼會有這種事情呢？』我過一會又問，芷當女裁縫一心忙着針綫時候。</p>
<p>『是這樣的！』她說，把縫針挿在衣物裏頭。『在五旬節二個星期以前，那時娜麗早已心煩氣燥了；我起初以爲是因爲那個木工好久還沒有寫信給她，但有時我又覺得似乎這個婚約使她難受，她自巳似乎不曉得怎麼辦才好。她時常發脾氣，一點也不顧慮到會得罪了我，或者得罪了高貴的主顧：尤其聽見跳舞館音樂響時候，她脾氣發得更厲害，因爲她答應過木工不再到跳舞館去的。有一天晚上我們正坐在我的門口板凳上，我的姨姪同幾個夥計到我家來閒談。他是一個裁縫，前一天剛從外邦回來。他到茵萊河一帶遊歷過，在那裏二三個城市中做過工；他說過這幾個城市底名字，但我忘記了。別的夥計問他，他談說着。—『你也看見克里斯多夫，魏爾納了麼？」一個人問。—「那個木工麼？我的確看見他；他正走了紅運。」—「有甚麼好事呢」另一個問。—「甚麼好事麼？他娶了師傅底女兒；她是有……你懂得我的竟思麼？」說時他做了手勢，像數綫樣子。我聽這話時心裏很難過、「孩子，放淸醒一點吧！」我說，「你幫謅些甚麼！」—「咄哈，姨母，我是很淸醒的！」他喊，「他刨着板做他那新婚床時候，我還在旁邊哩！」——娜麗聽了這句話，一聲不響便從板凳上站起來，拿了她的帽子，頭也不回就沿街走了。「她有甚麼難過的事情？」我的姨姪還問。—「我也不知道，狄特里希。」—我的確是不知道。她和木工并不怎麼熱烈，因為他追求了她很長久，在許嬏以前她還考慮了兩次。我雖然巳經曉得她同那個高貴少爺，那個大學生，的事情，但我并未曾想到他會還樣把她那執拗的頭腦完全弄昏了。</p>
<p>『我還同他們坐了一會，聽那個孩子，那個木工，談些故事；但我祇半個耳朶聽着，不久我便忍耐不住了，因爲我很關心她。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>平市取締租妻</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>北平二十四日專電有云：市府近以二十二日報載，平市有發現租妻惡風，如果屬實，殊屬有碍風化，今日訓令公安局，分飭所屬一體切實注意，並嚴密偵查取締。」</p>
<p>中國之有租妻惡風，我想絕不是今天才「發現」的「新聞」，前不久滬上各報就載着貴州省城來的通信，說此風在那兒是怎樣盛行，以及幾多錢可以租一年幾多錢可以賃一月的事實。就在北平，以筆者往年旅居所悉，此事確已點綴於我們「古城日落」的故都裏，若果到四圍城廂或天廠一帶去查訪查訪，租妻之事還有一種「瞞上不瞞下」的市面行情。中國人向來是拖峨冠立廟堂，晞着眼睛俯瞰塵寰慣了的，如何能透視到這地獄般的情景；就是一般士君子流，到了北平也只曉得三殿三海是怎樣的雄壯幽勝，這些事對於他們是見之而不知，知之而不言的。</p>
<p>那麼何以此風突然會宣騰報章，並引起當道的嚴密取締呢？讀者大概還記得，自從灤東成了戰區浪人橫行以後，隨着產生了許多「會社」，就在那要開辦「當小孩」「押婦女」的事業。中國古話有云，覆巢之下無完卵，我國北部一度驚恐之餘，彷彿平市便入於同樣的情景。問題很明白，當小孩買兒女既迫不得已的潛滋暗長，「租妻惡風」又何嘗不會在同一理由下盛行。親血骨肉都不能不分拆。何能同他們談到甚麼風化，廉恥。</p>
<p>對於此事我們不想引伸來談甚麼婦女問題，因爲在這事的本身去談婦女解放，值等於一種文字的游戲。中心的癥結，在於如何消滅租妻的根本原因，當然這根本原因又有他的根本原因。只要大家以已度人，誰也不願將老婆租給別人，自己却空帶其「綠帽子」的。對於「租妻」若是以「風化」爲重來加以取締，這無異勸人說，「大丈夫」餓死不要緊，却萬不能帶「綠帽子」。因此功令一行，許多帶「綠帽子」的懾於威力固可暫時不「租妻」，然而在飢寒交迫下，又何能保蹬他們不由長期的「租」，變作短期的賣？但是這樣一來，不知所謂「風化」也者，又將何以自存，不傷乎風化又在那要。</p>
<h3>江畔</h3>
<p>— 達雲</p>
<p>黃沙的江流，這里特別窄狹，潮水急湍地從高處瀉下，水面上打着團團的漩渦，白的浪花飛濺着，高高地。</p>
<p>堤岸是潮濕的。綠草更不起殘踏，現着衰頽的狀態。成羣結隊的牧童，橫坐在牛背上，口里吹着輕快的口哨，有的提高着嗓子唱着村里流行的山歌，望冒着裊裊的炊烟的鱗次櫛比的村莊走去</p>
<p>天邊燒滿着一片片的紅霞，看去不像落日的餘暉，凉風陣陣地吹着，紅靑蜓順着風向成夥兒環繞飛向對岸去了。懂事的成年人，大家都預料到不幸的事情會降臨到頭上來，不像那些　輕的小夥子，還吹着歡樂的歌調，抱懷着幸災樂禍的心情，無憂無慮地消磨過時日。</p>
<p>血紅的雲霞，黃泥的江水，帶着凉濕的風，成夥兒的紅靑蜓，……這些，在經騐豐富的人們看起來，原是水災的預兆。</p>
<p>江水離堤岸祇有尺把來高，無疑地，水的災難是可能的。憑着大家過去的經騐，如果天公再下一陣雨，上游的溪洪暴發，凶猛的水流壓瀉下來，這堤岸難免給衝潰了，那末，數月來辛辛苦苦培養的田稼，就將給泛濫的洪濤浸蓋了。於是種田人眼巴巴所盼望的秋收，將化作烏有。瞧着江心團團滾滾的水流，激發飛濺的白色的浪花，誰的腦海里都浮印着這幕可怕的水災底魔影。</p>
<p>「天老爺眞有意和咱們這些種田人尋開心！」秀欽哥招起腦袋瞧着天空里燒紅的晚霞有所感地咕噥着。</p>
<p>「可不是嗎，上年田土旱得龜裂，秧子晒炙得成卷子的低垂到地面上，任憑怎樣的請出龍王來，許下了三七一大堆的願，和虔誠地　求，終是不肯下雨，眞是牠媽的……」盛氣橫溢的雄大爺，雖則年紀可算不少，然而說起話來，總帶着幾分蠻野和火氣，他不怕天，—從去年起他就不信任天神，龍王，這一類冥冥的菩薩，他不相信罵了天和菩薩就會有什麼「罪過」，受責罰。</p>
<p>想起去年鬧旱災的情景，雄大爺的胸腔驀地彷彿挿下一把尖利的刀子似的！他活了這麼多的日子，從沒有瞧過像去年的旱災鬧得多麼凶，多麼厲害！十幾年前也嘗鬧過旱災，那時雖則沒有稀粥吃，但，至少野茡薺和草根總還夠馬馬虎虎地渡過日子，可是去年的旱災，連樹皮樹根也都給人們剝光掘盡了，接着，瘟疫又蔓延起來，在村上橫行，每天村上總有接二連三的人給裝進薄薄的木匣子里，肩到村外的荒塚上去；他的老婆和兒子，就在這沒有半點血腥氣味而又殺人不貶眼的瘟疫底翅膀撫糜底下，給帶到天國里去，祇勝下他孤零零的一個兒。</p>
<p>瞧着騰騰滾滾滿含着黃泥的江水，和聽着橫坐在牛背上的牧童底口里盪漾出來的悠閒自得的挑逗情慾的輕薄風騷的山歌，這使雄大爹的心窩冒出一股熊熊的火燄來，他憤憤地叫罵着：「你們這些死不盡的野種，簡直全不知死活還唱着你媽的屁歌！大水一來，休想有樹皮樹根來飽肚，大魚在等侯你們這些浮屍哩。哼，全不知死活的野種！還在唱你媽的屁歌！」</p>
<p>西北角的天邊，翻騰着朵朶的黑雲，迅速地把火紅的晚霞吞蓋了，電光接連一閃一閃地在黑雲里刻劃着金色的長蛇，雷隱隱地鳴打着。「上頭準又下雨了」。側着頭與秀欽哥說：「水災是免不了的，唉，一切都完了！雄大爹望着水面上團團的漩渦，和飛濺的浪花呆呆的嘆氣。</p>

<h3>遷居</h3>
<p>— 牟木</p>
<p>一個人，單身隻影的旅居異地，爲了生活與環境，他的居所是恰像水上的浮萍，無有定處的。而租寓人家的房子也儘有說不盡的麻煩和不便，常常爲了人家的喜惡；或則是自己的關係，總得悶着一肚子氣，撅着嘴來東搬西徙。雖然自己到現在還沒有資格成立一個「家」，但就這幾隻箱子，臥床檯子以及一些零星碎物書本之類搬移起來，也儘夠頭痛的了。</p>
<p>在房子住定以後，常常都會覺得日常需用的東西總是欠缺這樣，未備那樣，爲了一隻小紙盒，一根小釘，都會惱得發狠，也是常事，對自家又得大發一肚牢騷。不過，平時儘管覺得應用的東西太少，一旦搬移起來又覺得無用的東西多得無法搬動，紙頭呀，紙盒小瓶呀，破鞋爛箱呀，結果又有一大批廢物丟棄。有時爲了搬運費上的計算，檯椅鐵床都得丟掉。心里雖痛惜不過，也無可如何。</p>
<p>現在又得搬遝了。—「搬家」我是沒有資格夠說的—但遷到那里去呢？這又難爲我了。上海的弄堂房子，這大熱天是不敢領教的；仍在江灣罷，但要找到有自來水給我洗操的地方又實在太少了，何况還要樓房？大烈日下，流着滿頭汗跑了一整天，回來只有倒在凌亂的床上發呆嘆氣。日子又快到期了。在送走回家的友人以後，看着那房中凌亂的樣子：空了的書架，搬脫的裱壁紙，塵痕疊疊的檯椅，心里眞是又焦急又荒凉。想不到這小小的遷居問題，會這應擾亂我的心！</p>
<p>早上，大房東已來關照過，說今天下午就有新住客要搬進來。但我又還在那里打圈子！在上海登了幾年，給我學了一點乖，知道上海的世態人情，都不是建築在「交情」上的；爲了不願受人家的白眼，還是識相好些，下了一個决心，就費了一個上午的時間，遷到這個新居來了。</p>
<p>房子雖然是新建起來的小洋房，但住在樓底，鄉鈸里多的是毒惡的蚊子，這樣一來可眞叫我無法在燈下提一下筆了。在白天，不是了頭的哭喊，就是小孩的喧叫。然而，這個地方還算上選的，我不能再加挑剔，因爲我中了衛生學的毒，習慣要我每天要冲一次凉，這里就正有自來水給我供用。</p>
<p>對於新居，事前縱使如何合意，在搬來後的最初幾天，總覺生疎不慣的。何况現在已不是住在自己佔有一幢房子的時候。比如用開水罷，就得人家的用人做完了以後纔輪得到你的。結果時常只得自己拿了熱水瓶到茶館泡去。若果不是肚子餓不過我眞不高興每天中午向晚穿鞋着襪到飯館里去吃飯了。而今繼知道自己有娘姨供用的便當享福。想到還有兩月悠長的夏天，心里眞不知如何是好。</p>
<p>這里尤使我難受的是夜夜開不膩的收音機，自然，能夠開一二套西樂，或者高尚優美一點的中曲，也頗惹人愛聽的；而淸早開的一陣嗡嗡嗡嗡的唸經聲，大約是房東太太在那里誠心禮佛的時候了。然而，上海人之懂得生意經，由此也足見一斑。</p>
<p>房子總算住定了，雖然有許多缺點。以後除非至不得不搬開時，我是打算抱媽虎主義混下去的；生活已决定只能租人家的房子來寄足，全合自己理想的事情是難於水底撈月的，而且我也實在無此勇氣來享受遷居所生的苦惱了。</p>

<p>同住的幾個人都已經先後離此他去，往日那一份使我感到極端厭惡的無謂的煩擾也隨着他們而去了。我頓然覺得一陣輕快，彷彿從離亂的鬱久的劇塲跑出來的那種輕快，幾乎是長長的個把目的光景，與一支靠以支使日子的筆桿脫離關係，這固然可以說是由於天氣過分迫熱，活都活不了，還做得了這種向腦袋用盡挑撥的方法的精神消磨的事，但亦是因爲環境不容許我作一點鐘甚至一刻鐘的靜坐，這的確是完全難能的，當我正在艱辛地孕育出一滴思緒，準備讓臂腕梳爬出來的時光，幾個每天里惟以閒談或說着粗野的故事過日的輕浮的同住的人，不是一陣大大的鬨笑，就是突然高起來的嗓子交雜胡鬧着，也許便有誰從背後拍了我一肩膀，拉我加入，他們無聊的談笑，我雖然表示並沒有感着怎樣的興趣，他們的興趣自然很濃。而這會子一滴思緒早已悄悄遠逸了。我只得無可奈何地投了筆，苦悶地站起來。或許索性溜出門，因爲他們那種　鄙俗的嘴臉，卽使我是默默地坐着，也會引起無端的惡威以至於無端的憤怒，這一月來筆桿墨水瓶便動也沒動過的躺在桌子，叫塵埃蓋着厚厚的層了。場在他們走了。這偌大的屋子，單勝下我獨個兒佔據着。我儘儘管把門牢閉，不必再像以往擔心着又是誰來叩門，那些叩門的人，也是和他們一起絕跡，縱使偶爾當一半次的叩們聲，我可以裝做沒人在的不加應理。這樣，我渴求若的靜穆是漸漸親近上來了，而需要在靜穆之下進行的作活也該是着手的時候吧，我决心重新耕植久荒的硯田，可是爲了這些日子人變成一匹野馬，動得過度的心一下子有點按捺不下。一切都異樣地覺得生疏似的，抓在手里的筆彷彿成爲一支竹槓那麼沉重，腦子像生了銹的久廢的機器，怎樣也泛不起一些漪論。這如何好呢，想寫的辰光却不能給我一個適宜的境地，如今有着適宜的境地則又撩不出，我悵然面着稿紙而太息了。並且在這爲我所徧愛的寂寞的情緒中，我又常常太留心在寂寞里僅有的音響的一聲鳴蟬或一聲哇叫，在百無聊俚的夏之長日間，打太陽昇，蟬便藏在綠葉蔭里吚吚地叫着，囀得那麼的股切，那麼的有節奏，我如果剛好在醞釀着一些文思，這聒絮的鳴蟬卽將立刻奪去我原有的文思，而另外給我發生一種不同的念頭和心情。且從這生命十分短促的小動物從那嘹喨的調子的時候，到獨滯的時候，再到哽啞的時候，我彷彿聆着日子馳駛的足音，從一個季節渡到另一季節，使人連想着有許多事，有許多東西也會如這蟬聲的闌珊似的，一樣的闌珊下去了。</p>
<p>同樣能夠把我的思想弄出岔子的，在夜中，除了遠處冷落的傳來一聲尖銳火車的火車的笛子，此外就是屋子後淺塘間蛙的噪嚷，聽着則似乎載着幾乎凄凉的意味，爲了是在深夜，四野寂然無聲無闐，蛙的叫是極其淸晰而刺耳的，若是在雨後，那就將更繁密似驟雨了，這蛙聲很容易鬧得我心緒繚亂，往往有可能叫我離開了坐位，把攤開的稿紙塞進拍屜里，或者竟滅了燈，睡是別用心想的。踱近窗前，望望黑黝黝的天空，月是沒有，祗有疏落的星子閃着冷眼，聽聽叫的越殷勤嘓嘓的蛙聲，在這冥濛的渾渾噩噩的暗夜里，蛙的生命也似乎不渺小，却有了無邊的孤獨了。而我倒不曾爲這攪我睡不着的蛙鳴煩惱，我憂愁的是，我的想念太繽紛了，簡直沒有彙集的可能，那等什麼時候才找到題目呢？</p>
<h3>大水來了的時候</h3>
<p>— 二郎</p>
<p>何大叔氣喘喘地踏進自己的家門，一看，家裏靜寂寂地一個人也沒有，只見花貓在堂屋裏的桌邊翻肚皮用四隻腿兒亂抓空氣玩耍。</p>
<p>——小牛的媽，小牛的媽！……×媽的，死到那裏去？喊着，沒人應，罵起來了。</p>
<p>小牛的媽——何大娘——這時正在後頭院子里收拾被連日的大雨淋濕了的柴枝稻草一面將那些柴枝稻草披開來在院子里晒太陽，一面嘴里咕嚕着，「都濕透了，都濕透了！」幷沒有聽見前頭何大叔的聲音。何大叔尋到後頭來，看到何大娘那樣的閒情，心裏浮上了一個思想，「還在晒這些鳥！」大聲喊住何大娘，甚至可以說是喝着她道：「趕快呀，大水來了，收拾東西上樓去！」說着自己轉身到屋裏，動手搬東西去了。</p>
<p>大水來了？何大娘今天早上就聽到這個消息，可是不相信來得這麼快；同時回想起大前年水來了的時候的情境可怕，呆住了。何大叔在屋里已經搬了一個箱子到樓上去了，還不見她來。×媽的，還在後節幹嗎？搶出去大聲喊道，「快來呀，死在後頭！」何大娘這才好像從夢中醒覺過來一樣，三步搶作兩步，一拐一拐地進了屋里。</p>
<p>何大娘不是一個能幹的女人，平常老給何大叔打罵，就是因爲她的笨拙。這時一聽到「大水來了，」魂不附體似地呆了一大半，進了屋裏不知道要收拾什麼東西的好。她雖然也去忙着，拿這個拿那個，臉上還急得大汗直流，時常用袖子去揩拭，可是當何大叔將衣箱搬上樓以後，要到堂屋里去挑穀子的時候，回頭一看，她是在將床底下的破鞋子破爛布塞滿了一個小竹箱子！這不由得何大叔不冒火，喝了她一聲：「你幹嗎的？衣服不收拾，拿那些破爛東西做什麼用？×媽的，給我滾，滾到河裏去吧！」</p>
<p>何大娘才覺醒似地，自己亦覺得好笑，爲什將床底下的破鞋子破爛布收拾起來呢？　　那些破鞋子破爛布從小竹箱子裏抓出來又忙將牠們塞到床底下原來放着的地方去。上床將小牛的連大叔的與自己的衣服破棉被都拿起爬下床來。走了幾步，又呆住了，待要塞進小竹箱子里去，棉被太大，小竹箱子裝不進去，待要順手拿上樓去，却碰着何大叔背上一大簍穀子哼着聲一音小心地已經走到木梯邊；於是將棉被放在梯邊地下，然後搶到床上要去拿衣服。床是古式的是幾代祖宗傳下來的寶貝，又寬又大，她爬進裏頭將衣服拿出來，待要將它們放進小竹箱子里頭去，看一看，却被自己抓得散亂亂的一堆，心想：「放在箱子里的衣服，應該疊好，」又放在床沿上，一件一件地疊摺齊整，然後一件一件地放到小竹箱子裏頭去。</p>
<p>何大叔將堂屋里的七八簍穀子通通背上樓去了，何大娘的衣服還沒有收拾好，外邊傳來敲鑼聲子。還夾着話語：「大家到堤上搶堤去呀！」何大叔心裏一急，看她慢吞吞地在疊摺衣服，搶上前，一巴掌，就打了去，「×媽的，還不快點！」何大娘退了一步將身子閃避，可是已經吃了一記耳光：她習慣地大哭大鬧起來了。索性連衣服都不去收拾。何大叔兇着眼睛扳着臉孔，手指着她道，「回頭看你還不快點收拾，再揍你！」說着跑出屋子要搶堤去。剛到門口，小牛笑嬉嬉地從外頭跑來，一路叫媽，「大水來了，已經上堤了！」何大叔知道危急，對兒子道，「帮你媽收拾東西上樓，我搶堤去。」又道：「你不要來呀，小鬼頭！」</p>

<h3>關胖子肚臍眼中變鉛筆</h3>
<p>「凱歌」有聲片拍「春生家門口」的那天，演員有袁美雲·王桂林·魏鶴齡·王引·關胖子宏達·姜修等·拍好了四個鏡頭，已到午飯時間，大家吃飽了後，坐在綠樹蔭下休息閑談。關胖子腹大量大，別人早經食畢出飯廳，他猶狼吞大嚼，直至食足九大碗飯後，始口哼「凱歌」中袁美雲所唱之懷春歌，搖頭擺股的走出膳廳，袁美雲見而問道：「胖子你今天吃了幾碗飯」？「今天天氣太熱」胖子的回答，「國吃了九碗飯」。</p>
<p>「九碗飯還嫌少嗎？怪怪龍的冬」！美雲怪驚奇的伸出了鮮紅的舌尖。「告訴你。不要害怕，咱吃過十二碗的，在東北當義勇軍抗日的時候一頓更吃過三十個大饃饅「。</p>
<p>「呵！胖子。你的肚臍眼眞大」，美雲指着胖子露出外面　毛茸茸的大肚臍眼說。</p>
<p>「大不可希奇，希奇的是它會變戲法」，胖子很得意的說：「諸位要看戲法不要」？</p>
<p>「好；要看，要看……」。</p>
<p>胖子學着魔術家的派頭，指手劃脚，忽前忽後，喘嘆氣，汗如雨流，忽然口中大喊一聲：「出來」，只見他把肚子向前一挺，一根長有寸餘的鉛筆，從肚臍眼裏飛出，於是喊彩叫好之聲，如雷灌耳，有人將鉛筆拾還給胖子，胖子仍舊塞入肚臍眼中，引得個個稱奇呌絕，目瞪口呆，下導演萬蒼看得滿意，獎賞汽水兩瓶，一霎間鐘聲大作，拍戲時間到了，「凱歌」又繼續開拍下去。</p>

<h3>日本的廟寺建築</h3>
<p>— 伊東忠太（著）張廣正（譯）</p>
<p>誠如本文作者所說，宗教建築，實雄視建築界，居於指導其他建築的地位。我們綜觀中國，希臘羅馬，印度等有悠久文化歷史的國家，其歷久而仍在建築界保持相當地位的建築藝術，多以教堂廟寺爲代表。且近代建築式樣，受其影響之處極多。</p>
<p>日本的廟寺建築，在東方建築藝術上，亦佔相當重要的地位。本文作者爲一日本有名的廟寺建築專家。從這文中，我們對日本廟寺的建築，已可得到概略的認識。（譯者）</p>
<p>宗教建築與非宗教建築</p>
<p>在西洋，自昔建築界大別爲二：一，曰宗教建築，一曰非宗教建築。而宗教建築，實雄視建築界，居於指導其他建築的地位。在日本，從前如此；尤其是佛寺，保持住建築界王位的威嚴。但時至今日，因宗教的不振，連帶而使此種建築威嚴失去。僅成爲建築王國中的一州一省，以至不能不和一般非宗教建築的官衙，校舍，公會堂，大公司，劇塲，工廠，住屋等相提並論。此乃歷史的趨勢與非宗教建築急激躍進的結果，固爲世界共通的現象。</p>
<p>與此同時，於是人們對世界宗教建築的考究方法爲之一變。且以爲神廟佛寺，住屋，官衙，工廠等，本來同爲建築物，其間原無尊卑高下之分，現在硬把建築別爲宗教的與非宗　的二種，對這種方法，覺得沒有多大意義。但今就我（著者稱，下仿此）對此考察所得，述之於次：</p>
<p>在此，先須考慮的問題，是神廟究竟是否宗教的這一點，關於此問題，人們盡知其雖經長時間的討論，而至今仍得不到明確的解答。若將宗教嚴格地狹義地下定義，則神廟可以說不是宗教的建築；然若加以廣義的解釋，則神廟亦可說是宗教的建築了。茲姑且就認神廟是和宗教的存在而存在的。至於佛寺，那當然完全是宗教的建築，這可無用多說了。（未完）</p>
<h3>建築史話（二）</h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>希臘人似乎具有非常敏感而且訓練得很好的眼睛，所以他們不歡喜有式樣或比例不十分合式的建築物。他們創造而且完成被稱爲「建築三式」的柱樑建造的三種模範建築式——第一種叫做陶立克“Doric”，第二種叫做埃盎匿克式“Ionic”，第三種叫做科林多“Corithian”。不但柱頭大不相同，而且嵌綫和裝飾亦隨建築式而互異，比例亦不相同。“Doric”是其中最平淡的，也是最強固的。到了希臘人被羅馬人征服以後，純粹的希臘建築就告終了。勝利的羅馬人雖從他們的新順民那里採用許多建築設訏，但他們却把這些建築設計全和他們自己的建築設計混和起來了。</p>
<p>羅馬人是非常勇猛的，進取的，實際的民族，不畏巨大的工作，常以可驚的方法使工作完成。他們所感到興味的，宏大與壯麗勝於美的完整。他們很多利用巧妙的方法，以便宜的代價和短暫的時間收得巨大的效果，例如，用大理石板罩覆磚或三和土的房屋，用直柱和拱木裝飾空白的牆壁。</p>
<p>可是，羅馬人雖多利用這樣的「詭計」，但他們究竟不失爲優良的建築師和上乘的建造者；他們的偉大的建築物到現在還存留在歐洲各處啦。</p>
<p>他們也有他們自己的建築式—其實，三種是多少仿傚希臘建築式的，第四種組合式（Composite）可以說是他們自己的。和希臘人不同，他們格外注重拱門和圓屋頂。</p>
<p>從羅馬人的建築物，我們可以略窺他們度着怎樣的生活—先受治於共和政府，後受治於帝政，自勞苦工作和多效率的時期以迄鬆懈奢華的時期，最後則爲曾稱雄一時的帝國的破裂。</p>
<p>仍爲羅馬人所有的首都，後來從羅馬遷至拜占廷Byzantium（卽君士坦丁堡）從此所謂拜占廷式建築便發達起來。磚是那兒就地出產的材料，他們便以精良的技術利用這材料，特別是供建造圓屋頂之用。羅馬人的圓屋頂是房星內外形式相同的，這是羅馬建築物和希臘建築物不同的特點之一。</p>
<p>於是，比以前更有權力的耶教徒，建造許多屬於這種建築式的教堂；在這時期以前的教堂比較簡單，取法於舊式羅馬法庭，大多數是從羅馬建築物的廢址搜集柱子及其他材料而建造的。同樣，在不久以後，住在羅馬帝國的土著也開始建造他們自己的房屋，利用傾頹的羅馬建築物的殘餘材料，或粗略地摹仿它們。</p>
<p>隨着耶教的發展，教堂的建造逐漸增多，這些教堂的設計兼具拜占廷式和過去羅馬式，這混合的結果就是產生我們稱爲拜占廷的羅馬建築式。傳入英國的北歐式，和以前英國原有的撒克遜式，都是羅馬建築式隨地變異的產物。</p>
<p>和原來的羅馬建築物一樣，這些羅馬建築式經過變遷後的產物亦以大量的材料爲建築物鞏固的基礎；可是，從這些建築式，一種被稱爲哥德式的完全新異的建築式却逐漸發達起來。這是注重智巧的平衡勝過注重堅固的構造的一種建築式。尖角形的拱廊和窗門開始被採用；輕巧的圓屋頂給用石肋當撑：拱廊和圓屋頂的橫壓力相互平衡，，以免碎裂和移動。這時期的建造者已懂得工程學的知識；他們利用這知識使輕巧的材料可以造成堅固的建築物。（完）</p>

<h3>從建築藝術說到希臘的神廟（四）</h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>——世界建築史蹟上最光榮的一頁——</p>
<p>（二）　希臘神廟與柱頭設計</p>
<p>希臘神廟上柱頭的出現，可說爲世界建築史上一頁光榮的奇蹟；牠不僅爲當時造成希臘建築藝術的一支生力軍，又爲後世建築藝術上供獻最大的藝術結晶品。故在此地我們不得不大書特書的。原來希臘美術之進化，可分成三期：</p>
<p>（A）經過Jnspiration時期，結果有多立克柱頭Doric　Order的出現。此種柱頭卽創自Dorians人，柱身中部稍大，而不甚高；全部以簡單及粗大爲主，係合平方板，Abacus圓盤Echinus，及圓輕連續之柱頭Neching，組合而成，別無裝飾；此爲美術進化初期的產品，故爲諸柱中之最古的作品一直留存到現代。應用此柱頭之神廟代表作，則首推建於亞克羅坡利堡塞Acropolis上之派生登神廟Partheno　Athens；並且牠亦爲世界上挺着名的一座神廟，其在建築藝術上之地位，可想而知。</p>
<p>多亞克柱頭有人主張說牠是從木頭建築物裏變化出來的，但亦有人主張說牠是從石頭建築物裏變化出來的—因爲柱身是非常之粗大，木頭决不能作成的，非石頭不可也。至此種方式之神廟，則在Greece，Holy及Siciiylll處地方最多。</p>
<p>（B）第二時期，則有愛阿尼亞柱頭Lonic　Order的出現。柱身細長，下有雙盤爲礎，柱頭則用渦卷形爲裝飾，故覺優美；此柱之神廟，其唯一之代表作，則首推建於派生登神廟之北之Erechthion　Athens神廟，最著名於世，並且此神廟在南邊的六個柱子，却把「石女神柱」代之，名之曰Coryatids，爲希臘自有建築史來第一次的發現應用者；故此柱之神廟，在建築史上，亦是一座極有價值的代表作呢！</p>
<p>（C）第三時期時，對於柱之細小部份極爲研究，故此期之出產品甚爲精細美麗，極美化之能事，故有可林新柱頭（Cornithien　Order的出現。此柱力以裝飾爲務，柱身既極細長，柱頭亦雕刻着繁褥之買芳棄形，（Acantbe之草葉）其起源係從埃及柱子及愛先令柱子混合而成，並且其形狀極似一鐘倒置之狀。據羅馬某名建築師謂，第一次用此柱之人並非用於建築物上，而却用於銅器物件上，係某一古代墳墓上面一塊銅片之花紋也，爲Callinachus民族第一次在銅器上應用之，亦爲此柱花紋之來源之一說也。此柱雖甚華美，然已惇希臘人合理之性情矣。此柱之代表作，則有奧林比亞神廟Olimpia　Temple此外極少應用之；因爲此柱之作風，同希臘之民族性是不相調和的；根本，希臘的美術，是以忠實爲主的啊！</p>
<p>以上三種柱頭在現代諸偉大的建築物上，及含有紀念性的或美術性的建築物上，極多應用之。如果我們跑到黃浦江畔沿外灘一帶去流連一下，當能證明我的話並不虛僞的了。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Tangshan on the 28th reports that two people outside the Gangyao kiln in eastern China were struck and killed by lightning, their bodies charred black, a truly tragic sight. (29th Central News Agency Telegram).</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster in Hua County</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Red Swastika Society's second relief team reported to Beiping that Hua County, due to its low-lying terrain, has become a gathering point for floodwaters from Changyuan, Lanfeng, and Kaocheng. The entire area has become a swamp. The fifth, sixth, and seventh districts are the most severely affected, with over 390 villages flooded and over 1,000 people drowned.

<h3>Jining: The Zhaowang River Continues to Rise; Two Breaches on the North Dike at Tangjiakou</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Zhaowang River in Jining rose four inches on the 28th and two inches today. The surrounding areas are flooded. People are taking earth to reinforce the dikes. Today, two breaches, each about ten feet wide, occurred on the north dike at Tangjiakou, east of the Liangqiao and west of the bridge. The floodwaters have merged with the breach at Wang Guitun, increasing the force of the water and threatening to overflow the Jining-Jiaxiang highway to the north. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Construction Department, due to the sudden rise of the Weihe River in northern Shandong, which has triggered warnings in various counties, has dispatched technical officer Zhou Li to inspect the situation. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu: The Great Dike Nears Completion; Preventing the Yellow River from Flowing Southward Without Blocking Its Entry into the Sea</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Great Dike in northern Jiangsu, built by 120,000 workers, will be completed in ten days. The dike is 120 li long and is intended to prevent the Yellow River from flowing southward without blocking its entry into the sea. Wu Hui in Shandong Province has been reassured. The water level in Weishan Lake has risen two meters in the past three days. The dikes along the Zhongyun River and the Liutang River, which flow into the sea, are being reinforced. If the water level rises another four meters, the flooding in northern Jiangsu may be unavoidable. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Various counties under the jurisdiction of Xuzhou are taking precautions against the Yellow River and constructing the Great Dike in northern Jiangsu. Officials and civilians in Shandong Province believe that this will block the Yellow River's flow, exacerbating the disaster in Shandong. Letters and telegrams have been exchanged, causing great concern among the people of both provinces. On the 29th, according to Director Shen of the Construction Department, the southern flow of Shandong's floodwaters enters the canal through Weishan Lake, with the Hukou Dam and Linjiaba serving as outlets. Repairs to the dams have been carried out historically to regulate the flow, with the discharge volume determined by the water level of the rivers and dikes downstream. The current flood prevention efforts in Jiangsu Province are still being carried out in accordance with established practices. As for Tongshan and Pei counties, fearing that the Yellow River might pour in and the flow from Weishan Lake might become excessive, potentially causing breaches and overflows, the dikes southwest of Weishan Lake have been raised and thickened. The intention is to ensure that the water flows into the canal. The breach at Linpu is wide, and the water flows slowly. The capacity of Weishan Lake has not yet been reached, and there have been no overflows of the dikes. The barriers have not yet served their purpose. Therefore, there is no question of blocking the upstream flow or exacerbating the disaster in neighboring areas. This dike is limited to the west bank of Weishan Lake and should be properly named the West Dike of Weishan Lake, which has no connection to the Yellow River disaster in Shandong. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A report from Pei County states that most of the water from Nanyang Lake has overflowed to the northeast. Therefore, Weishan Lake has stopped rising in recent days, and the water level is still within the banks, far from the newly built Great Dike in northern Jiangsu. A telegram from Shandong stated that the water level in southern Shandong was being forced to back up due to the obstruction of the Jiangsu dike. This indicates a lack of understanding of the location of the Jiangsu dike. The Jiangsu dike is designed to prevent the indiscriminate overflow of water from Weishan Lake and has nothing to do with the discharge of water into the canal. The Great Dike is nearing completion, and the Linjiaba dike in northern Tongshan also began construction yesterday, with plans to install sluice gates to facilitate storage and discharge. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huaiyin: According to a telegram from Pei County, the Huaiyin Huai River Diversion Project Office and the Flood Prevention Office are on high alert due to the rising water level in Weishan Lake. Deputy Director Chen has repeatedly dispatched engineers Guan Chengwu, Ke Tang, and Gu Lianchao to inspect the Zhongyun and Liutang dikes in Lianshui, Muyang, Shuyang, Guannan, Sixian, and Suxian counties. Director Xu, who also serves as the head of the Flood Prevention Office, has just arrived in Huaiyin and immediately plans to personally inspect the conditions of the damaged dikes along the aforementioned rivers and repair them without delay. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The principles of flood prevention in Jiangsu Province are: 1. Repair the dikes of lakes and rivers to prevent the Yellow River from overflowing. 2. Maintain the original sluice gates and dams in Weishan Lake to regulate the flow. Regarding the reorganization of the Hukou Dam, the provincial department has telegraphed the Provincial Economic Committee to request instructions. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Shuangcheng River Breaches Again; Villages in Yutian Affected</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Shuangcheng River in Yutian breached again on the night of the 27th, and the floodwaters have merged with the Huanxiang River. Villages in the second and third districts have been affected. The water level in the Luan River shows no signs of receding. After the Hukushi Dam was urgently reinforced, hundreds of villagers have been stationed there day and night. The Lufengou Canal has been breached by the floodwaters and is also about to overflow. The people are mobilizing to prevent it. The Dacheng River in Macheng has overflowed, posing a risk of backflow into the Ao River. Villagers are sounding gongs day and night to warn of the danger. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Floodwaters Rise in Handan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level in the Dongfu River in Handan County has risen and overflowed. More than a dozen villages, including those in the southern and central areas, are surrounded by water. Over 2,000 mu of cotton fields have been flooded, with floodwaters reaching three to four feet deep on the plains. There is no hope of harvesting. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Eastern Sichuan: Drought Afflicts Various Counties</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Wanxian, Zhongxian, Fengdu, Shizhu, Fuling, and Changshou counties in eastern Sichuan have experienced no rain since the beginning of July. Liangshan, Dianjiang, Linshui, and Mianzhu counties have also experienced drought for over twenty days. The fields are cracked, and the seedlings are withered. If it does not rain in the next few days, a major disaster is inevitable. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Urgent Relief Efforts Underway in Changyuan</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Baoding reports that County Magistrate Zhang Qinglu of Changyuan has telegraphed the province, stating that Committee Member Xin arrived in the county despite the rain and, together with the county magistrate, inspected the entire Taihang dike. Upon returning to the city in the evening, he convened local gentry to discuss urgent relief measures. It was decided to divide the area within the western river dike into five groups, each with two people, and allocate 4,000 yuan for relief. The area within the eastern river dike was divided into two groups, with 1,000 yuan allocated for relief. Each household with four or more people will receive one yuan, while those with fewer than four people will receive 50 cents. Due to the large disaster area, the standard for relief is based on those who cannot survive without it. Since the floods began, the county has dispatched police to rescue over 780 elderly and vulnerable flood victims and shelter them in the Chenghuang Temple. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangrong telegraphed the Economic Commission, reporting that the reports of a breach in Changyuan are inaccurate. However, in the middle of the Yanggeng Dam and the Shiba Dam, the surface of the dike was damaged, with a width of about 13 zhang and a depth of about three to four chi. The Qingtuba Dam on the southwestern side of the dam was also damaged by about four zhang, but it did not lead to any danger. Approximately 300 villages within the dike on the west bank have been affected, with a population of about 120,000. The commission has dispatched Liu Qinglin, a resident commissioner in Jinan, to conduct an on-site investigation. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

Ye personally met with them in the Central Second Conference Hall, accepted the petition, and listened to Chen Jin's explanation of the purpose, requesting the Central Government to take remedial measures as soon as possible. Ye replied with a sincere attitude, stating that the procedure for reconsideration was extremely cumbersome. It would be best to stipulate remedial measures within the detailed implementation rules for the Publication Law. These detailed rules are still under study by the Ministry of Interior, and the Central Political Conference can decide on the principles based on the points presented and instruct the Executive Yuan to implement them. Finally, Ye stated in a solemn tone that he would be responsible for pursuing the matter. The representatives then took their leave. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin press community has responded to the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association's opinions on improving the Publication Law and jointly telegraphed the following: "To the esteemed Central Political Conference in Nanjing, we have investigated the newly revised Publication Law by the Legislative Yuan, and its content differs greatly from the current law. We fear that its implementation will encounter many difficulties. The Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association has already submitted an appeal. We respectfully request that you adopt the association's opinions, re-examine the law, and return it to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The press community will be greatly fortunate. Tianjin Dagongbao, Yongbao, Shangbao, Yishibao, respectfully submitted on the 28th." (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italy's Economic Panic</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Chinese people have always believed that under Mussolini's rule, Italy's economic situation must be more stable than that of other countries. In recent months, Italy's military buildup and ambitious plans in East Africa have particularly given people the impression of strong national power. Therefore, the recent abandonment of the gold standard is indeed worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Some believe that Italy's recent action of abandoning the gold standard is a result of excessive military spending in Africa. However, a telegram from Rome on the 23rd stated that it was a result of Italy's recent foreign debt of 500 million lira. However, upon closer examination, it is clear that these two events, while being contributing factors, are not the absolute cause, let alone the root cause. Italy's current military expenditure in Africa is still less than 1 billion lira (according to a European telegram on the 27th, it was 975 million lira as of the end of June). The amount is not very large and is insufficient to explain the current abandonment of the gold standard. The real reason lies in Italy's adverse international trade. As for the inability to balance the fiscal budget, the continuous increase in the issuance of national debt, the inability to reduce unemployment, and the inability to maintain the gold standard, all are the results of adverse trade. Even the military action in Africa can be largely regarded as being prompted by this kind of economic situation.</p>
<p>Italy has always been an import-surplus country, similar to China. The difference is that Italy has complete tariff autonomy. Since Mussolini came to power, he has always made it his goal to control import surplus. However, this kind of policy, if implemented in a country rich in resources and with autonomous tariffs, would not be very difficult. However, it is a major problem to implement it in Italy, which lacks coal, iron, and other industrial raw materials. Since Mussolini strictly restricted imports and vigorously developed agricultural production, the import surplus has decreased. For a period of time, the international balance of payments was also balanced. However, since 1930, the import surplus has reappeared. For example, the average annual import surplus from 1931 to 1933 was around 1.4 billion lira. In the past year, it suddenly increased to 1.7 billion lira. In the first four months of this year, it has reached more than 753 million lira. Based on this observation, the figure is likely to be over 2 billion lira by the end of the year. Italy's annual import surplus is so huge that the national economy will inevitably suffer a serious blow, and the financial situation will inevitably be affected first. A budget deficit is inevitable. According to historical statistics, Italy's budget deficit has been increasing continuously. For example, the deficit in 1931-32 was 57.6 million lira, which increased to 338.7 million lira in 1932-33, 290 million lira in 1933-34, and 297.4 million lira in 1934-35. At the same time, in order to make up for this budget deficit, the government is constantly issuing public bonds. Therefore, the amount of public debt has been increasing since 1928. For example, in 1928, the total amount of government public debt was 86,418,000,000 lira. By the end of November 1934, it had increased to 128,000,000,000 lira. According to recent estimates, it has reached a staggering 150,000,000,000 lira. Judging from Italy's national economic strength, it has reached a saturation point. In the future, without borrowing foreign debt, it will be impossible to make up for the deficit. Furthermore, the number of unemployed people in Italy has also been increasing in recent years. In terms of registered unemployed people, the number has often been around one million in recent years, whereas in 1925, Italy's unemployment was only over 70,000. The contrast between the two is indeed unbelievable. However, this number only refers to registered unemployed people. Including those who are not registered, the number should be around two million. Considering these points, it can be seen that Mussolini's sudden announcement of the abandonment of the gold standard is a necessary means to overcome the economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mussolini's display of military might towards Abyssinia, even at the risk of engaging in a war, can also be said to be influenced by economic panic. Sending troops to Africa can, on the one hand, divert the nation's attention. On the other hand, it can provide jobs for the unemployed at home. Thirdly, if the war goes smoothly, it can also satisfy Italy's desire to obtain raw materials and expand its market. However, can military action really solve the economic panic? We will wait and see.</p>
<h3>Naiman Banner: Seven Japanese Tragically Killed; Japanese Aircraft Once Surrounded Near Nuanchi Pond</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the Naiman Banner incident, according to subsequent investigations, the final moments of Counselor Yamamori and the other six were extremely tragic. Initially, they intended to fight their way out and seek help from friendly forces, but at that time, the enemy had already invaded the public office and opened fire, killing Counselor Yamamori and Instructor Nakane. Driver Iwamoto was killed in the open space in front of the public office. Employee Sasaki and Mr. and Mrs. Kimura of the Salt Affairs Office were also killed south of the public office. The remains of these martyrs are too tragic to bear. The traces of their struggle to the end are clearly visible. (29th Dentsu News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Investment in North China: South Manchuria Railway President Says Under Investigation; Plans to Cooperate with Japanese Financial Groups in the Future</h3>
<p>Moji: South Manchuria Railway President Hayashi Minoru and his secretary Nishiwaki arrived in Moji on the Ural Maru from Dalian on the 19th. They are scheduled to board the Fuji special express train tonight at 8:30 to head east. According to reports, the president's return to Japan is entirely for personal matters. The following is a record of his remarks: Reorganizing the South Manchuria Railway is not only ineffective but also inconvenient in terms of control. The reorganization issue is easy to talk about but difficult to implement. If it is to be implemented, it is necessary to increase capital, which will have a significant impact on the domestic Japanese financial market. The news of the reorganization has become very quiet. As for the plan to invest in North China, it is still under investigation, and no decisions have been made. However, in the future, we will cooperate with financial groups from the banking sector to make progress. (29th Japanese Union Telegram)</p>
<h3>London Newspaper Reveals British Navy's Seven-Year Plan: Proposing to Build New Ships with £150 Million; Suspicions Arise Regarding Japan's Reaction to Britain Abandoning the Ratio System</h3>
<p>(London) The British "Daily News" today published the British Naval Department's seven-year plan. The detailed rules of this plan have been notified to the governments of other related countries. This plan is flexible and can be modified at any time, but according to the "Daily News," future modifications are more likely to increase than decrease. It is estimated that during the period from 1935 to 1942, several British warships will be decommissioned under the Washington and London Naval Treaties. Therefore, Britain intends to build the newest warships with £150 million to make up for the shortage. The ships to be added include 50 to 72 cruisers, 84 to 142 destroyers, 39 to 57 submarines, 8 to 10 aircraft carriers, and battleships will be reduced from 15 to 14. However, in practical terms, what needs to be built during the period from 1935 to 1942 includes 12 battleships, 33 cruisers, 63 destroyers, 21 submarines, and 3 aircraft carriers.

<p>(London) The British Naval Department neither acknowledges nor denies the British Navy's seven-year plan published by the "Daily News." (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American naval community does not believe that the British Naval Department's shipbuilding plan published by the British "Daily News" will trigger a world shipbuilding competition, in which Japan will express its major activity. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) How the United States will maintain its naval superiority in the Pacific after the expiration of the naval treaty is a matter of utmost concern to the government and senior military officers. Recently, the British government announced its intention to abandon the ratio system, which has aroused deeper interest in this issue. All discussions in official circles here are kept strictly confidential, so it is not yet known what steps the government will ultimately take. However, in recent days, official circles have stated that when Stimson was Secretary of State, he advocated that the ratio issue and the Pacific fortification issue should not be separated. Now that the situation has changed, the United States must decide on a precise naval policy as soon as possible. The so-called changes in the situation include the following six points: (1) After all naval restrictions are removed, naval powers may engage in shipbuilding competition; (2) The autonomy of the Philippines; (3) Japan's major construction of merchant ships; (4) The U.S. Congress opposes legislation to expand U.S. merchant ships; (5) The imminent establishment of Pacific air routes; (6) News from Tokyo that Japan may establish cruiser bases on various Pacific islands after the expiration of the current treaty. Therefore, the most concerned issues for the military are the fortification of Pacific islands and the increase of merchant ships. Official circles generally believe that if a new treaty cannot be reached, the national defense issue will be very serious. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Britain announced its abandonment of naval ratioism, the United States also issued a statement that it would not adhere to ratioism, so there is hope for the resumption of the Naval Disarmament Conference. However, Japan is not very optimistic about this new situation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Naval Ministry authorities infer that there must be a major intention behind it, or that they want to push the responsibility for the failure of the disarmament conference onto Japan. Therefore, Japan will deal with the new situation very carefully. (Hualian Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira will arrive in Yokohama on the 2nd of next month and enter Tokyo on the same day. The Japanese disarmament work, which has been suspended since the preparatory talks, is expected to become lively. The activities of Japan to realize its disarmament policy in the various tasks of the British Secretary of the Navy Monsell's declaration to abandon ratioism, the United States' promotion of shipbuilding according to the quota stipulated in the naval treaty, and the strengthening of Pacific defense work are particularly worthy of attention from various countries. After Ambassador Matsudaira returns to China, he will first report to Foreign Minister Hirota and Navy Minister Osumi on the progress of the London preparatory consultations and the changes in its atmosphere. Secondly, based on the results of the Paris ambassadorial conference and consultations with Ambassador Saito to the United States, he will propose the most effective and appropriate new disarmament policy. It is reported that the content of Ambassador Matsudaira's report and proposals is roughly as follows: (1) At last year's naval preparatory talks, the fundamental claims of the British, Japanese, and American navies were opposed to each other, and in fact, the meeting was adjourned at a step before a break.</p>
<p>(2) The convening of naval consultations was entrusted to the UK for handling, but the UK is busy carrying out European peace work, and now there is only a confrontation between Japan and the United States. Moreover, since Europe believes that there is no hope for the establishment of a naval agreement, it has not actively carried out the naval preparatory consultations and formal meetings of the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States.</p>
<p>(3) If the UK truly understands the current situation in East Asia, it will definitely realize that its work in East Asia must have Japan's cooperation. (4) At this time, the United States, on the grounds of containing Japan's work in China, is expanding its existing naval power and strengthening the defense work in the Pacific, and is cooperating with the UK to jointly prevent the decline of British and American power from the Far East. This kind of British-American cooperation and American activities in the Far East must be guarded against. (Japan Allied News Agency Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The "Sunday Dispatch" reported that the British Army is expected to be completely transformed within a year. The plan is to completely abolish the current rifles and replace them with light machine guns, and to abolish horse-drawn artillery teams and replace them with high-speed tanks and armored vehicles. The thirteen-pound small guns will also be abolished and replaced with three-inch seven-caliber howitzers. Even the army uniforms will be completely changed. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to observations of Filipinos here, General MacArthur, Chief of Staff of the U.S. General Staff, who is currently organizing the army on the Philippine Islands, will soon go to Manila to plan naval facilities, because after the establishment of the Philippine autonomous government, it must have a navy to protect it. Moreover, the independence of the Philippines, although it can be made a permanent neutral country in the form of a treaty, the effectiveness of the treaty is very limited. Therefore, it cannot but rely on the long-range navy of the United States as a guarantee of strength to defend the Pacific region. Furthermore, MacArthur is not only a soldier with profound military knowledge, but also a genius in strategy, so his mission to Manila cannot be regarded as merely an action to develop Philippine army equipment.

<h3>Unanimous Decision by the Japanese Military and Government: Major Reform Plan for the Army; Taking the Absolute Autonomy of East Asia as the Standard; Deciding on a Five-Year Expansion Plan of 900 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army has become an abnormal situation for emergency purposes. The Japanese military, from Minister of the Army Hayashi and Vice Minister Hashimoto to the General Staff Headquarters and military authorities, unanimously believe that the Japanese army needs active reorganization and strengthening, and that it must create military preparations for absolute autonomy in East Asia based on Japan's special position in the Orient. Therefore, according to the international situation, industry, economic power, and national finances, a five-year expansion plan of 900 million yuan for the establishment of army military preparations is requested to be included in next year's budget in order to carry out more concrete steps. This major reform plan will be carried out decisively without avoiding any difficulties.</p>
<p>It is found that the 900 million yuan five-year plan for this major reform plan averages approximately 180 million yuan per year. The plan is as follows: (1) Materials Preparation Plan. In addition to obtaining assistance from the parliament and stipulating that the reorganization fee is 200 million yuan, plus the wartime material preparation fee for the air force, the total cost is approximately 500 million yuan, which will be prepared in five years. Among them, the expenses required for air defense and air defense, which were previously approved by the parliament, are approximately 25 million yuan for the enrichment of aviation preparations in "Manchuria," and the rest is to complete the reorganization of the foundation of aviation preparations, which will be completed by 1938. If this plan is completed, Japan's military strength will double.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has formulated countermeasures for the issue of extraterritoriality and administrative rights of affiliated territories in Manchuria. After the decision of the joint meeting of the Office of Manchurian Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of the Army, it adopted a gradualism approach and gradually resolved the issues in the order of postal rights, taxation rights, industrial supervision rights, and judicial rights. This plan will be implemented after being approved by the cabinet meeting on August 1. (Hualian Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>The Emperor Organ Theory: Minobe Will Be Punished; Retired Soldiers Hold Regular Meetings</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Minister of Justice Obara returned to Beijing, he immediately discussed the punishment of Dr. Minobe with Chief Prosecutor Inomata. The Prosecutor's Office held a meeting today and planned to punish Dr. Minobe under Article 26 of the Publication Law. (Hualian Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the government's statement clarifying the national ceremony, Cabinet Secretary-General Shirane is currently drafting it. As for the timing and form of publication, a very cautious attitude is currently being taken. Shirane visited Minister of Internal Affairs Goto and Minister of Justice Obara on the 27th and 28th to seek various opinions. The issue of the disposition of Dr. Minobe is expected to be determined at the end of July, but the attitude of the Ministry of Justice has not yet been determined, so it is unavoidable that the disposition will be delayed. On the one hand, the content and form of the statement have been changed due to opinions from the military. It cannot be attached to the regular cabinet meeting on August 1. However, after the government decides to dispose of Dr. Minobe, it will promptly issue a statement to resolve the Emperor Organ Theory issue. Approximately eight days will be required to complete all procedures. On that day, the cabinet will formally decide to publish it immediately. (Dentsu News Agency Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Empire Retired Soldiers Association believes that the Emperor Organ Theory is completely inconsistent with the beliefs of soldiers, so the retired soldiers are becoming more united. The method has been carefully considered, and it has now been decided to abandon the wait-and-see attitude. It has been decided to convene a national congress of branch representatives of the National Retired Soldiers Association in Tokyo in late August. The convocation was issued today in the name of General Suzuki Soroku. At the congress, they will declare and resolve to oppose the organ theory, and will issue a call to the whole country. They will also discuss the active implementation methods for rejecting the organ theory in the future, and the 3 million members will move forward to realize the method. Also, when implementing it, they will do their best to support and criticize the government's methods, but they will act individually with the government's policies or measures, and they are determined to achieve the goal. Therefore, the future is worthy of attention. (Dentsu Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain Assaults; South Manchuria Railway Halts; Traffic on the Antung-Mukden Railway is Also Cut Off</h3>
<p>(Dalian) According to the announcement of the South Manchuria Railway Bureau, since the morning of the 28th, Korea and Manchuria have been hit by heavy rain. Much of the sand and soil along the railway lines in Korea and Manchuria has been washed away, and bridges have also been washed away one after another. The South Manchuria Railway Main Line and the Antung-Mukden Railway have now been cut off. The situation is serious. The South Manchuria Railway Department is now working hard with the Railway Bureau, the Korean Railway Bureau, and other military and police authorities to try to restore it. Between Nanfen and Xiamatang on the Antung-Mukden Railway, the bridge in Wudaogou was washed away, and landslides and land collapses occurred between Lianshanguan and Xiamatang. Therefore, the fourth train that should have arrived in Antung at 7:30 this morning was trapped between Xiamatang and Nanfen, in a dilemma. The military is now protecting the 160 passengers and trying to send them out of the disaster area. Between Zhangtaizi and Liaoyang on the South Manchuria Railway Main Line, the embankment was also breached due to the flooding of the Taizi River. At 10:27 am on the 29th, it was still impossible to open the line. By noon, trains were blocked on the South Manchuria Railway Main Line in pieces. Other routes have been greatly affected and cannot be repaired for the time being. As for the Taizi River, the water level is still increasing, and the area along the way is in danger. (Japan Allied News Agency Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) According to the South Manchuria Railway Company's report, the business performance in the previous year was extremely prosperous, with total operating profits reaching 46.46 million yuan.

<h3>Hidden Reefs in Japanese-American Trade: U.S. Senate Proposes a Silk Goods Compensation Tax Bill</h3>
<p>Osaka: The U.S. government believes that the import of raw silk and rayon is a competitor to cotton, so it intends to levy an import compensation tax. It had this intention last year, but it has remained an open issue due to opposition from the U.S. silk fabric industry itself. Who knew that this time, Senator Bankhead's old proposal was brought up again in the U.S. Senate? Japanese silk merchants were in a panic when they heard the news. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also attached importance to this matter. If the United States levies this kind of import compensation tax on silk goods, it will be a huge blow to Japan. Because in Japanese-American trade, Japan has a trade deficit. The goods that Japan exports to the United States are almost all silk. Whether Japanese-American trade will fall into chaos in the future will also depend on this case. (Hualian Telegram, 29th)</p>

<h3>The Abyssinian Government Submits a New Document to the League of Nations Declaring its Willingness to Continue the Investigation; Italy Will Also Participate in Tomorrow's Meeting</h3>
<p>(Geneva) People here are more optimistic about the Italian-Abyssinian dispute because the Abyssinian government sent a letter to the League of Nations today. The Abyssinian document declared its willingness to continue mediation and stated that the debate on this matter had been raised by the Abyssinian representative of the mediation committee. The Abyssinian government now wishes to hear the decision of the League of Nations Court of Justice on the interpretation of the terms and recognizes the application submitted by the Abyssinian representative regarding the interpretation of the mission of the mediation committee. The document also stated that the Abyssinian government had never agreed to limit the powers of the arbitrators, and the League of Nations Executive Council should adjudicate the dispute between the two arbitrators. This document has caused a very good impression here. The document did not mention Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, and did not suggest that the meeting on Wednesday should discuss the whole case. This section is very important, so it is hoped that the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on Wednesday will be limited to discussing mediation and management issues, so that at least one month of free time can be obtained, so that the relevant powers can make further efforts to find a peaceful solution to the dispute between the two sides. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Abyssinian government sent a letter to the League of Nations today, saying that it is willing to continue mediation. Therefore, this afternoon, the Italian government has decided to send representatives to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on Wednesday. However, it is believed that the Italian representatives will formally move in the meeting that the basis for the mediation committee's discussion has been firmly decided in the May meeting, and there is no need to raise this matter again at Abyssinia's request. Since Abyssinia wishes the discussion of the mediation committee to be limited to the border conflict case, the Italian-Abyssinian negotiations should be regarded as having ended, and the Executive Council meeting can be adjourned. According to Roman people, if the meeting on Wednesday intends to make a comprehensive discussion on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, the Italian representatives can easily postpone the meeting. Italy may be prepared to announce its views on Abyssinia at the League of Nations meeting on August 25, but it is expected that Italy will refuse to do so. Therefore, the League of Nations will be forced to have a general discussion on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute at this meeting. However, Italy's refusal to express its views cannot be interpreted as Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>The Roman Pope Eagerly Hopes to Maintain Peace, But Italy and Abyssinia Still Continue to Deploy Troops</h3>
<p>Holy City: Today is the 75th anniversary of the death of Pope Representative Cacobi, who died in Abyssinia. When the Pope prayed to God for blessings for Cacobi, he mentioned the Italian-Abyssinian dispute for the first time, hoping that the two countries could maintain peace. The Roman political circles especially welcome the Pope's declaration, fearing that he would make comments that were completely unfavorable to Italy's policy toward Abyssinia. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

The Italians have purchased 500 donkeys and mules on the island of Sheplers and transported them to Eritrea on Greek merchant ships. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A semi-official telegram from Aigina stated that the Italian overseas Chinese in the Dodecanese Islands have received a notice from the Italian embassy to withdraw from A territory. Although the Dodecanese Islands belong to Italy, the residents are Greeks. They are familiar with trading with A people, but they opposed Italian rule after the European War. There are many of them in the territory of A country, enough to secretly plot changes, which will make the situation more difficult and make Italy bear the responsibility. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Aigina: The A king has decided to reorganize 3,000 armed police officers, led by military officers. Aigina is currently expelling bad elements and plans to contact the diplomatic corps to use a pass-through method to ensure that the overseas Chinese of neutral countries will not be interfered with during the war.

<p>(London) The Times' correspondent in Abyssinian capital declared that 5,700 Abyssinian troops had recently arrived in the capital from the two southern provinces of Gura and Waluren, led by Governor Gore of Gura. They went to Dabatai, north of Gonda. They carried both new and old French-made rifles, and some of them carried new weapons. This group of people went north and south. The action is to mediate, which shows that Abyssinia expects the enemy to attack soon, and the seriousness of the situation between Italy and Abyssinia can be seen from this. In addition, there are 7,000 soldiers in the Sitaino area who are coming one after another. The weather has begun to clear up. Abyssinia is deeply afraid that the Italian army may gradually advance and then launch a large-scale attack. According to Abyssinian sources, Italy is now moving personnel and weapons from the original large camp in Waltair to Makana in the province of Sibili. The natives of that area are more friendly to the Italian army than the natives of the Ogahen province. Judging from the current situation, what Abyssinia is worried about is the front line in Italian Eritrea to the front line in Italian Somaliland, which seems to have nothing to fear. This is because the propaganda made by the Abyssinian emperor is the most effective in that area. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Aigina: The Abyssinian Women's Assistance Army Committee met here this afternoon, chaired by Mrs. Wislo, a celebrity in the women's world of the capital. Leaders of the various armies attended the meeting. The association resolved to organize groups to provide relief to sick and injured soldiers during the war. According to Abyssinian customs, all members of the committee will provide material and spiritual assistance to the soldiers fighting. If soldiers are killed in battle, they will also be buried.

It also urged the government to protest to the government against Italy's immoral and barbaric attitude towards Abyssinia. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Italian Representative Appointed, Departing for Geneva Today</h3>

Other representatives include Guarnachielli, Director of the Foreign Affairs Division of the Prime Minister's Office, Undersecretary for Colonies Leschaine, and several legal experts. Aloisi is scheduled to depart for Geneva tomorrow, while the rest of the delegation will leave this evening. It is reported that the Italian government insists that the Executive Council meeting should be limited to explaining the powers of the Italo-Ethiopian Mixed Arbitration Commission, and that the appointment of a fifth neutral arbitrator by the Executive Council is unacceptable to Italy. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Ethiopian Foreign Minister Heruy, on Sunday, sent a note to the Italian government in response to the Italian government's note of July 23rd. It is reported that the Italian government is dissatisfied with Ethiopia's note, and therefore Italy may refuse to resume the work of the Italo-Ethiopian Arbitration Commission. The reason is that the note sent by Ethiopia to Italy differs in wording from the note sent to the League of Nations. The note sent to Italy contains firm claims regarding the fundamental issues of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Comparing this to the Chinese government's previous policy on the Manchurian issue, Ethiopia's attitude is actually stronger than China's at that time. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>American Federation of Labor President Denounces Hitler: Should Be Rejected by All Americans</h3>
<p>(Washington) The President of the American Federation of Labor, Green, issued a statement today, vehemently criticizing German leader Hitler, urging the US government to take appropriate measures to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment encountered by the German working class. Green declared that Hitler is more cruel than the monarchs who slaughtered heretics in the dark ages. The time has come when Germany should not only be rejected by the American labor community but also by all Americans. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party today accused Catholics and Communists of jointly conspiring against the government. According to a government announcement, Munich police confiscated a batch of leaflets, discovering that the Communist Party had suggested to Catholics that they unite to oppose the National Socialist Party movement. The National Socialist Party's movement against the Steel Helmet Party is also becoming more active. The authorities have now banned veterans' gatherings and prohibited the wearing of uniforms in the Hschmargaden district. The National Socialist Party is paying close attention to news from the United States to see what attitude New York Mayor LaGuardia will take toward the riots of the previous day. German newspapers are all printing the news about this incident in large letters and are publishing editorials stating that the insult to the German flag must lead to diplomatic consequences, and the American authorities should apologize. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department is not making any statements regarding the turbulent situation in Germany caused by anti-Semitic and anti-religious movements. As for several German immigrants in New York who planned to open massage parlors and applied for business licenses from New York Mayor LaGuardia, the mayor refused to issue the licenses, citing the discriminatory treatment of Jews in Germany. Regarding this matter, a State Department spokesperson recently stated that the State Department does not intend to make any decisions until the German government formally lodges a protest.

<p>(Moscow) German Communist leader Pieck recently delivered a lengthy speech at the Seventh Congress of the Third International, which lasted six hours. The future policies adopted by the Third International can be seen from this speech. The outline is as follows: "(1) Communists believe that social democracy and the Second International have completely bankrupted, therefore only Communism is the only antidote to destroying the capitalist system. However, Communists should still try to unite with various parties holding democratic ideals to form the periphery of the Communist Party. The goal of all parties is to destroy Fascism, capitalism, or imperialism. Even if they adopt different methods, they should cooperate with them. However, the Communist Party should maintain the right to lead various movements, and should still occupy the leading position in collective combinations. (2) The organization of the Third International should be adapted to local needs according to local conditions. The Communist Parties of various countries should enjoy broad autonomy, but they are still subject to the control of the Third International and continue to be guided by the Third International. 3. Communist Parties of various countries should assume special tasks separately according to the needs of various countries. For example, in China, they should focus on opposing the aggression of foreign imperialism and defending the integrity of Chinese territory. In France, they should engage in more extensive actions, such as winning over the masses, resisting Fascism, and promoting Franco-Russian cooperation. 'In the Czech Republic, the recent accusations by Communist Party members that President Masaryk and Foreign Minister Benes have fascist tendencies should be corrected.'" (Havas, 28th)</p>

<h3>Former Dutch Prime Minister Colijn to Form an Extraordinary Cabinet; London Exchange Rate Shows Continued Rise in Guilder Value</h3>
<p>Amsterdam Queen Wilhelmina has instructed former Prime Minister Colijn to form a new cabinet. According to general opinion here, Colijn will soon ask all factions to support his plan to form an extraordinary cabinet, but this plan must be approved by Parliament. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam The news that Colijn was summoned to form a cabinet caused the guilder's value to continue to rise. It is expected that Colijn will form a new cabinet this afternoon or at the latest tomorrow. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The news that Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands ordered former Prime Minister Colijn to reorganize the government has greatly changed the trend in the foreign exchange market today. Speculators have rushed to cover their positions, scrambling to buy Dutch guilders previously sold by the Dutch, which has caused the guilder's value to rise from 7.365 to 7.31. The discount rate for three-month futures has fallen from 34 to 26. Although the hope that the Dutch guilder will adhere to the gold standard is greatly increased, well-informed sources claim that the Dutch Bank has lost £20 million worth of gold, so its defense capabilities have been weakened. People feel that if Colijn can form a new government, it will be more difficult for him to handle matters than before the economic bill was proposed. The previous government headed by Colijn collapsed because of this bill. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>US Gold and Silver Statistics: Last Year's Silver Imports Were Extremely High</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Department of Commerce's international balance of payments report states that last year's silver exports remained very small, totaling only US$16,551,000, but the amount of silver imported was extremely large, totaling US$102,725,000. The report also stated that from July 19 of last year to March 29 of this year, the US Treasury obtained a total of US$395,000,000 in silver. In addition to silver, the inflow of gold was even greater. Calculated at US$35 per ounce, the imported gold was worth a total of US$1,187,000,000. In addition, last year's surplus in US foreign trade was US$478,000,000, the largest amount since 1930. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to recent statistics, the value of gold imported from the Philippines to the United States in the first half of this year was US$6.6 million, more than the US$5.84 million in the same period last year, an increase of more than US$700,000. The value of silver flowing into the United States in the first half of this year was US$94,000, more than the US$40,000 in the same period last year, which proves that the production of the mining industry and agricultural production on the Philippine Islands is indeed great. Previously, some people thought that once the Philippine Islands became independent, they would have no way to survive economically. This point can be understood immediately.

<p>(Tokyo) Central Meteorological Observatory technician Arakawa said that the hurricane with a speed of 20 meters per second passed Ishigaki Island in Okinawa Prefecture on the 28th and blew westward. From the evening of the 29th to the morning of the 30th, southern Taiwan will be severely hit by it. This hurricane is still in the process of development, so it will increase its speed to 30 meters per second when it reaches Taiwan. Although its center will pass through the south, the entire island will inevitably suffer great damage. After passing through Taiwan, it will advance towards Fujian Province in China. The Japanese mainland can avoid its harm. (Japanese United News, 29th)</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from the Shimen County of Hunan Province appeals to the National Government Executive Yuan Relief Committee, the China International Famine Relief Commission, all organizations, all charities, all newspapers, and all groups: Shimen County is located in a remote area of western Hunan, with obstructed transportation. Natural disasters and banditry have occurred one after another, and the people have long suffered. Last year, a severe drought plagued the area, and the county's harvest was less than 20 percent of normal. The disaster situation was already serious. Unexpectedly, heaven did not tire of inflicting misfortune. Now, during the time when the autumn crops should be flourishing, we have suddenly suffered an unprecedented flood. Shimen County has the Ying River running through it. The upper reaches consist of many chaotic mountains, and the river flows swiftly and turbulently, making it extremely dangerous. Between summer and autumn, mountain waters erupt, and the situation is even more dire. Therefore, the slightest spring rain turns into a massive disaster, but even then, it usually only affects one or a few places, making it easier to remedy. Even in 1931, although boats could sail on the foot of the mountains in the county seat, it was not as severe as this time. Unexpectedly, from July 3rd to 6th this year, continuous rain fell, and mountain torrents erupted. All the large and small villages and important towns along the 200+ li of the Ying River were swept away by the raging waves. Farmland turned into gravel, houses were destroyed, and the topography changed. People who were caught off guard were drowned. Those who managed to escape were left with nothing. At this time, the autumn harvest is hopeless, and it is even harder to care about spring farming. The remaining survivors are destitute and lack both food and clothing. Suicides by drowning are reported daily, and corpses are everywhere. The stench of decay is overwhelming, and epidemics are raging, with no medical care available. Those who do not die from fire will die from disease. Alas, what a terrible fate for our people! We, who are concerned about our homeland and feel the pain deeply, have organized the Flood Relief Association of Fellow Townsmen Abroad. We are appealing to all parties, hoping to extend the life of the dying disaster victims for one more day. We have long admired your organizations' compassionate hearts and concern for suffering. Hearing of this catastrophe, you must feel deeply saddened. We respectfully request that you quickly grant us a large sum of money to provide generous relief, so that we can receive timely aid and save many lives. We are awaiting your orders in anticipation. Sincerely, the Flood Relief Association of Fellow Townsmen Abroad from Shimen County, Hunan Province.</p>
<h3>Shandong Province, Dongping: Three More Breaches in the Canal; Floodwaters Threaten to Enter Dong'e Lake</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Jinan: Amidst the reports of the Yellow River overflowing in western Shandong, the canal in Dongping County burst through three breaches west of Anshan Town on the evening of the 27th due to the Yellow River filling it. The water was extremely strong, and nearby villages were completely submerged. The terrain here is higher in the southwest than in the northwest, which may cause the water to combine with nearby slope water and flow directly into Dong'e Lake. The Xin Dian breach downstream of the Jinning Canal has already flowed to the Wujiawan northeast of the Si River. Its northward flow has reached the Jinpu Railway. Fortunately, precautions were taken early. Soldiers and civilians blocked the culverts and built crescent-shaped levees, so the water did not flood. The Nanyang and Shushan Lakes are still rising due to the inflow of the Yellow River water from Jiaxiang and Shanxian and the breaches of the Yun and Wen rivers. Fortunately, the dikes along the lake are in good condition, and Jinning and the northern part of the province may be spared from disaster. The waters of Nanyang Lake have reached the highway foundation north of Nandazibo, and are connected to the Yellow River water, reaching a width of 27 li. As for the plan to cut reeds in Nanyang Lake to facilitate drainage, the Jinning County Magistrate Zhen Guangyuan led the teachers, staff, and students of the rural schools in Qiaoshiqiao, Wang Guitun, and other three locations on the 27th, along with Commander Liu and Battalion Commander Wang of the 58th Brigade of the 20th Division with a battalion of soldiers on 100 boats. They departed. The work area extended from the north bank of the canal and between the Zhao and Wang Rivers, starting with direct cutting to Nanyang Town, about 60 li long. It will take about one week to complete. The Yellow River water in Heze has recently receded by 4 inches. The Yellow River water inside the Zhukou dike has retreated, revealing flat ground, and gradually stabilizing. On the 26th, heavy winds and rain hit Yutai, and the dikes along the coast of Nanyang Lake became dangerous works. People are working hard to protect them.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Has a Good Early Rice Harvest, But Disaster Areas Have Nothing</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Nanchang: Jiangxi is an important agricultural area of the Yangtze River. The harvest of three seasons of rice, early, middle, and late, is about 130 million dan per year. Since the beginning of spring this year, there has been sufficient rain. The early rice grew well. However, due to continuous rains at the turn of June and July, the water in the Gong River rose sharply. The rivers, lakes, and the Yangtze River in Northeast Jiangxi: Xiushui, Raohe, Xinhe, Ganjiang, Poyang Lake, all overflowed. Many people along the rivers and lakes collapsed. The low-lying areas are still one color of water. All crops are gone. Disaster victims are scattered and fleeing. However, in areas outside of the permanent disaster zones in the province, the early rice harvest in the mountainous areas and higher elevations is good. The early rice in southwest Jiangxi and the Fu River basin in eastern Jiangxi is more than 80% good. As the new grain enters the market, rice prices are falling in various places. The price of rice in this city, which was formerly 11 yuan per stone, has now fallen below 10 yuan, and is still falling.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Security Team Squad Leader Flees with Arms</h3>
<p>The various squads under the jurisdiction of the 12th Security Brigade of the county are stationed in the Pu-North area to protect the local area. The third squad of the first company is currently stationed in Shanyang, and Wei Tongwen, the squad leader of the ninth squad in the squad, is stationed in Jinshanwei on the coast. Unexpectedly, on the 23rd of this month at around 5:00 PM, the squad leader left the team for no reason and did not return that night. Before leaving, he took a Mauser pistol, serial number 698136, and 70 rounds of ammunition. Private Li Fucai noticed and reported to the squad leader, who immediately sent squad leader Liu Anfang and privates Chen Quanxing and others to investigate in various places, but no trace was found. The squad leader also went to various places to investigate but found nothing. He reported to the brigade headquarters. The brigade headquarters sent Adjutant Li Dengyun to rush to the defense area for investigation. The squad leader's station was more than ten li away from the squad headquarters, so he could easily escape with his arms.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Embezzlement Case Involving Farmland Tax - Bankruptcy Compensation</h3>
<p>The case of Zhu Jingbo, the former director of the Farmland Tax Collection Office, who was accused of embezzlement, has been going on for over a year and has not yet concluded. Last month, the government sent Zhu to the county government to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for detention. Later, due to illness, he paid 5,000 yuan in cash for bail. The Department of Finance has completed its calculation of the amount of Zhu's embezzlement, which totaled over 18,000 yuan. The county has been ordered to have Zhu pay the full amount. Zhu voluntarily agreed to compensate for this amount and has decided to sell his house in Youlan Lane, valued at about 20,000 yuan, and use the proceeds to repay the public funds, after deducting the 5,000 yuan that had been mortgaged previously. He submitted this to the county government for approval yesterday. However, the county government learned that Zhu also owned three self-built houses at the west entrance of the alley, and that these houses should also be sold together to cover the compensation. As for the criminal matter, whether to send it to the judiciary will be decided by the county government after reporting to the civil and financial departments and the provincial government.</p>

<h3>Provincial Committee Randomly Checks and Re-examines Smokers</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee recently dispatched Lv Xingfu, a member of the committee, to various counties to conduct on the spot checks and re-examinations of smokers in order to assess the effectiveness of the anti-smoking efforts in each county. The provincial capital designated more than ten names per county from the list of smokers who had quit smoking, and instructed Member Lv to randomly check them upon arrival. Now, Lv has come to Wuxi yesterday to inspect the County Anti-Smoking Association and the Smoking Cessation Center, and to conduct random checks and re-examinations of smokers. It is said that the provincial capital has prescribed two methods for re-examining smokers in order to prevent relapses: one is to have the county association submit a certain number of people on a regular basis, which the province will circle and designate for re-examination; the other is to have the province randomly select a certain number of people from the smokers' registry of each county and send staff or order the county to handle the re-examination.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Retired Soldier Arrested for Fraud</h3>
<p>Recently, a man from Hunan named Xu Yue, dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes with neat attire, went around defrauding people by presenting a card. Dozens of people have been defrauded, but none dared to speak out. On the 27th of this month, he presented a card to the Gu Zhihe family in the Nanguai Garden. The gatekeeper, seeing his neat attire, had no doubts and led him inside. After briefly exchanging pleasantries with Mr. Gu, he claimed to be an officer of the 88th Division and was about to go to Lushan for training, lacking travel expenses. He intended to borrow 200 yuan for expenses. Mr. Gu, not knowing him at all, refused to lend him the money. Unexpectedly, the soldier took out a pistol to threaten him. Fearing trouble, Mr. Gu gave him 15 silver dollars, and he left. On the same day, a similar incident occurred at the Shengxiangyun incense store in Dongwai. After investigation by the Public Security Bureau's detective team, he was indeed captured outside the North Gate on the morning of the 28th, taken to the bureau, and awaiting transfer to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Danyang: Change of County Magistrate in Danyang</h3>
<p>The county magistrate of this county, Bi Jingqian, recently developed a strong desire to resign and repeatedly requested resignation from the provincial government.

The vacancy has been entrusted to Hua Huiyue, who has passed the selection and is acting as an agent. It is said that the new County Magistrate Jiang is from Wuyuan, Anhui, and has previously served as the county magistrate of Anji and Ningguo counties in Zhejiang. After receiving the news, County Magistrate Bi has been rushing to complete the handover and is waiting for the transfer.</p>
<h3>Huangnianqiao Town: Bandits Rob and Injure Police</h3>
<p>At the Zhao Mao General Merchandise Store in Huangnianqiao Town, about 11 li from Erling Town, more than a dozen bandits suddenly appeared the night before, wearing short black clothes, carrying long and short guns and iron rods, and broke into the store. The store owner, Wang Hechu, was awakened from his dream and, unable to escape, was grabbed by the bandits and forced to reveal the location of the hidden money. When Wang refused, he was beaten and injured. The bandits then rummaged through the boxes and cabinets, looting everything, and left after about half an hour. Upon hearing the report, the Erling 6th Sub-Station immediately ordered police officers to pursue and capture them. The bandits had already fled, so they telegraphed the Danyang General Bureau and requested that police be sent to Erling to assist in the capture. Upon receiving the telegram, the General Bureau immediately ordered Inspector Peng and Police Officer Guo to lead the police out of the city and search along the highway towards Ke. When they reached the first wooden bridge about 5 li from the city, two barefoot men wearing blue short shirts and trousers suddenly approached. Seeing their panicked expressions, they immediately found many stolen goods on the spot and detained them. Inspector Peng then led the police officers to continue searching forward. After another half a li, they saw five more people approaching and ordered them to stop, intending to search them. Unexpectedly, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. With a loud bang, Police Officer Zhu Hongtong was shot and killed. The police officers immediately returned fire. The gunfire was intense for a while. As a result, two bandits were killed, and two were captured. One rifle was seized. The remaining three bandits escaped. It was not until dawn that the body of the deceased police officer Zhu Hongzhang and the two captured bandits were brought into the city. The bodies of the two dead bandits were temporarily placed under the Yin Gong Bridge outside Dongdou. According to the two bandits in the bureau, one named Gao Sheng and the other named Wang Guofa, they confessed to the robbery in Huangnianqiao without denial. They have now been sent to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Provincial Order Abolishes Cart Tax</h3>
<p>The cart tax in this county has always been contracted out by the Education Bureau to merchants for a total of more than 4,000 yuan, which is used as educational funding. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee has sent personnel to Haimen to investigate various donations and taxes. As the cart tax is levied on farmers and is indeed harsh and petty, it should be abolished. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Finance Department requesting approval to stop the levy. Yesterday (the 28th), the Finance Department ordered the county government to stop collecting the tax from the 24th year onwards.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Teasing a Dwarf Child Leads to a Fatal Incident</h3>
<p>Huang Gengxiang, originally from Tiantai, runs a bakery in Gan Yao Town in this county, and his business is doing well. He has a domestic servant surnamed Zhang, who is only 14 years old, with a small body and very naughty nature, which Huang dislikes. The day before yesterday, Huang ordered the dwarf child to carry a cake tray and sell along the road. At the end of the market, he fell asleep on the grass. Unexpectedly, someone secretly moved and hid the cake tray. When the child woke up, the cake tray was gone. Extremely frightened and wanting to cry, he was afraid of being beaten by Huang and hurried back. He questioned everyone in the store, and while they were arguing, Huang heard them. He grabbed the dwarf child, beat him severely, and ordered his wife to send the child back to his hometown. Thereupon, the aunt and nephew took a boat to Shan. After landing, they were still far from the station, so they walked west along the railway track. Just as they reached the Gou Shou Jingyang Bridge, a train came speeding from behind. In a hurry to get out of the way, both of them accidentally fell into the river. Passersby went into the water to rescue them. Huang's wife was fortunately unharmed, but the dwarf child was drowned. His body has not been found yet.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Newspaper Association's Talk on the Amendment of the Publication Law</h3>
<p>After the amendment of the Publication Law was passed by the Legislative Yuan, newspaper industries in various places rose up to discuss it. They considered that the amendment to the law imposed strict restrictions on the news industry and telegraphed the authorities one after another, requesting reconsideration. In the past two days, newspapers reported that Legislator Chuan Bingchang and Vice President of the Judicial Yuan Qin Zhen made statements, saying that after the promulgation of the amended Publication Law, if there were any obstacles that were difficult to implement, they should be carefully revised. The reporter interviewed the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Newspaper Association yesterday and inquired about this matter. According to the spokesperson of the association, in order to seek legitimate freedom for the press, the association believes that the Publication Law has many restrictions and that the points that should be noted have been telegraphed to the Central Political Council, requesting that it be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. This procedure, as Legislator Fu Bingchang said, if the Central Political Council submits it for reconsideration, it can be discussed again. Otherwise, the Legislative Yuan has no power to change the law that has been passed. It can be seen that although a bill has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, if it is believed that it is still necessary to study and revise it, it can be remedied by following the reconsideration procedure. If we wait until it is promulgated and implemented and then encounter difficulties before seeking revision, it seems that we will spend too much time. As for publishing personal or family privacy, it belongs to private legal interests. Therefore, the criminal law on defamation requires prosecution. The provisions of Articles 309 to 313 of the Criminal Law are very detailed and are not without restrictions. If the provisions of the amended Publication Law are followed, the competent authorities have the right to prosecute, which is in obvious conflict with the principles of criminal law.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, etc. Took the Same Train to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, came to Shanghai a few days ago to handle the business of the Central Bank. He took the night train from Shanghai to Beijing at 11 o'clock last night to attend the meeting of the Executive Yuan. He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, as well as Zou Lin, Deputy Minister of Finance, Liu Weichi, Deputy Minister of Industry, Chuan Rulin, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, and Yang Hu, etc., also returned to Beijing on the same train. It is difficult to predict whether they will return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Hurricane Is Still Far From Shanghai; It Is Difficult to Predict Whether It Will Hit Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that the barometer is falling today (29th) and the weather changes are uncertain, making the future weather difficult to predict. An extremely strong hurricane is currently attacking the coast of China from due east of Taiwan. This hurricane is developing very strongly and progressed quite quickly at the end of last week, but it is still far from Shanghai today and has not yet had a direct impact on Shanghai. Judging from its current direction westward or west-northwest, its severe power can be felt within days. If it deviates towards Shanghai, it will be even more severe. Its current position is greatly hindering southern shipping. The mail plane to Guangzhou tomorrow may not be able to pass safely. If the direction of the hurricane does not change, it will land near Fuzhou and disappear in Fujian Province. However, there is concern that it may change direction, in which case Shanghai will at least be on the edge of the affected area.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Unifies the Currency System; Collects and Melts Miscellaneous Currencies to Mint Decimal Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, China's currency system has always been very chaotic, which has greatly affected the livelihood of ordinary people. The authorities of the Ministry of Finance believe that it is necessary to unify it immediately, so the Currency System Research Committee of the Ministry of Finance was established. The committee also established a Shanghai office to assist in the affairs of the committee. Since its establishment, the committee has been actively conducting research on the national currency system, sparing no effort. According to reporters' inquiries in the financial sector, the unification of the national currency system is very difficult. This is a major matter, and it is necessary to conduct detailed research beforehand before proceeding step by step. Otherwise, the disadvantages will be seen before the advantages are achieved. The chaotic state of currency in various provinces and cities in China cannot be fully described in a few words, and the provinces of Sichuan, Guangdong, and Fujian are the worst. The more complex the domestic currency, the more exploitation there is in the exchange, and the small businessmen are the ones who suffer the most. Before proceeding with the unification, we should first investigate the chaotic state of currency in various places across the country, and then mint decimal currency to replace it. The collection and melting of miscellaneous currencies in various places will not be effective in a short period of time. Therefore, on the one hand, the Ministry of Finance has the Central Mint minting new coins every day and circulating them on the market. On the other hand, the Central Bank is collecting and melting miscellaneous currencies in various places. As for the use of decimal currency to mint subsidiary coins with nickel and other materials, it is said that the Currency System Research Committee of the Ministry of Finance is actively planning it.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Si Hai Ship Begins Selling Hong Kong Tickets; Chinese Ship Owners Will Start Implementation From the Hai Li Ship Starting August 3rd</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been selling Hong Kong passenger tickets and has been negotiating with the Hong Kong government many times. Since July, the Hong Kong authorities have recognized China as a country that has signed the Nine-Nation Maritime Safety Convention and allowed it to issue passenger licenses, but each ship must first obtain the international navigation safety certificate issued by the ministry. The Hong Kong government can then issue passenger licenses based on this safety certificate. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has sent Zhou Houkun, deputy director of the ship department, to Beijing to collect the international navigation safety certificate from the Ministry of Transportation. They will be distributed to the shipowners of the Haiyuan, Haining, Haili, and Haizhen to be handed over to the Hong Kong government for verification when they arrive in Hong Kong. Then, the passenger licenses will be issued to each ship. Now, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has received instructions from the Ministry of Transportation that the Hong Kong authorities have publicly recognized our country as one of the countries of the Nine-Nation Maritime Safety Convention, and the international navigation safety certificate has been issued. Passenger tickets to Hong Kong can now be sold to benefit passengers. The bureau has also obtained the Hong Kong passenger license and allowed the passenger stock to sell Hong Kong tickets for all classes on the Si Hai ship from today. The Haiyuan ship will depart tomorrow. This ship could have sold Hong Kong passenger tickets (because the shipowners are Westerners), and the first Chinese-owned ship to sell Hong Kong tickets is the Haili ship that will leave Shanghai on August 3rd. The current ticket prices are: First class (Deluxe Cabin) - 50 yuan, First class cabin - 24 yuan, Second class cabin - 17 yuan, Third class - 9.5 yuan, Fourth class - 7.6 yuan.</p>

<p>Chairman Wang Yansong said in his opening speech: "Today is the first time that the association has invited the owners and representatives of various factories in this city. It coincides with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce entrusting the Industry and Commerce Loan Committee to issue loan application forms, which also starts today. Therefore, the number of people attending the meeting is more than expected, and the reception is not very thoughtful. I am very sorry. As for the significance of the association inviting the owners and representatives of various factories, it has been described in the official letter. The association is an organization organized by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce based on the motion of the Sixth Member Congress. Its task is to work with the industrial and commercial circles to raise appropriate plans in order to seek effective relief. This task is extremely important, and it is not something that the colleagues of the association can bear with their thoughts and talents. However, in the face of national difficulties, we dare not avoid difficulties and shirk our responsibilities, so as to avoid inevitable accusations. This requires joint efforts and cannot but be based on the principle that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, and we hope that the industrial and commercial circles will enthusiastically advance and cooperate sincerely to reduce the inevitable accusations. In our country's society, we are always happy to criticize various problems, but the result of the criticism often makes the work of solving the problem unable to increase benefits. For example, the association is an organization that plans to relieve the unprecedented difficulties of industry and commerce. Critics often accuse it of being slow because it cannot immediately propose a proper plan after its establishment. This kind of criticism is extremely admirable, but it should not be overlooked that there are various difficulties, such as increasing tariffs and controlling foreign exchange, which are the best ways to curb imports and revive industry and commerce, but they cannot be implemented temporarily due to environmental reasons. Other things, such as flood attacks, are also external causes that promote the decline of industry and commerce. The best way to relieve the disaster is to dredge the river channel, but due to financial reasons, we can only do prevention. Therefore, the formulation of a plan must take into account both the actual strength and the environment. The so-called plan is not a paper article or an oral speech that embodies personal ideals, but a method of studying the factual environment, collecting thoughts from many parties, carefully sorting them out, and seeking to conform to the environmental facts to solve the problem. If the association, after its establishment, does not conduct practical research on the current environment and only proposes methods immediately based on one aspect of the problem's needs, I am afraid that this method will inevitably encounter the difficulty of being too hasty. Therefore, it is necessary to learn from the past and know the hidden things as a warning. The plan for governing a business is the same as the policy for governing a country. Therefore, the plan cannot be obtained in one case. If it is so easy, industry and commerce will never fall into decline and suffer the pain of calling for help without a door. Colleagues have recently invited leaders and experts from various industries to discuss the reasons for the decline of industry and commerce. They feel that the reason is that there is no appropriate plan for governing the industry. The so-called no appropriate plan for governing the industry means that there is no sound organization in terms of economy and personnel, and there are no accurate statistics on production and consumption. Without statistics, there is no way to know oneself, and without organization, there is no way to know others. If you don't know others and yourself, you will certainly not be able to cope with the attacks of commercial warfare, and gradual decline is inevitable. If we want to revive industry and commerce, we must attach importance to investigation, statistics, and training in order to formulate plans and promote the application of plans. Therefore, the association's work starts with investigation. The obtained investigation materials are analyzed by statistical methods to analyze the reasons for the decline of industry and commerce. Experts are invited to study and predetermine a reasonable plan. On the other hand, we can pay more attention to training so that managers and staff know how to be loyal and dutiful in order to seek the soundness of their own abilities, and then submit them to the government for practical assistance. In this case, it is not necessarily hopeless to save industry and commerce that is trapped in the phenomenon of recession. Today, the general opinion is that the only way to relieve industry and commerce is to increase chips. This is undoubtedly true, but how can we make the ideal of increasing chips a reality? We must study it. For example, doctors all know that a certain prescription can cure the disease, but they also know the place to buy the medicine and the way to reach the place to buy the medicine before prescribing the medicine. Otherwise, even if there is a good prescription, what is the use of the disease? Now, to take a step back, assuming that the proposal to increase chips will become a reality tomorrow, and we ask the critics to distribute it on our behalf, I am afraid that the critics will also need investigation and statistical materials and are unwilling to distribute it without selection. It can be seen that investigation and statistics must be valued in the future. The association has already started working on the work that must be valued in the future today, so it should not be described as slow. Therefore, if we want to save the declining industry and commerce, we must first invigorate ourselves and develop the spirit of self-help, and then we can expect people to rescue us, and we can also advance to rescue others. The association's investigation, statistics, and training work are based on the source of the disease and strive for self-invigoration and self-help methods, which can complement the proposal to increase chips. I hope that the enthusiasts and pioneers in the industrial sector can provide sincere cooperation and assistance to the association's work. What I want to solemnly state on behalf of my colleagues today is that first, the association will absolutely keep all kinds of investigation materials confidential and will not leak them except for the research of the staff. If there are certain materials that are more important to keep confidential, you can also submit them to the association's executive director in writing to be kept more strictly. Second, the association's current work is limited to the 43 industries that have been determined, but the association is also willing to sincerely welcome other industries outside the scope of the 43 industries who are willing to cooperate with the association according to the initial working procedures.</p>
<p>Investigation Instructions</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce forwarded the application forms for small loans for industrial and commercial credit. It is estimated that there are more than 400 national goods factories and shops, and about 400 forms have been issued. It is stipulated that the period for issuing forms is from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm every day, except for holidays. In addition, the instructions for the association's industrial survey form state, "The purpose of the association's investigation is to find out the reasons for the decline of industry and commerce. It is necessary to have a clear understanding of the current phenomenon of each industrial and commercial organization before seeking relief, and then there will be a path to follow. For this reason, the filling of the investigation form must sweep away the common state of concealing the disease and avoid medical treatment. Based on the facts, talk about the source of the disease, so that effective cooperation and assistance can be expected. The forms issued by the association are for research purposes only and are kept confidential from the outside world. It is especially hoped that the various items listed will be filled in in detail, and please attach your opinions on relief." "Regarding the statement of opinions on relief, it must be divided into two categories: opinions on relief for oneself should be listed as the first category, and opinions on relief for the industry in general should be listed as the second category. Regarding the opinions on relief for oneself, it is best to list in detail the production efficiency and restoration guarantee that can be increased after obtaining relief. If the writing space in the original form is not enough, you can write on a separate sheet."</p>

<h3>Headquarters of the Aviation Association's General Mobilization Team Holds 22nd Office Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Office of the General Mobilization Team of the China Aviation Association convened its 22nd office affairs meeting at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday to discuss all matters related to the progress of fundraising and donations. The attendees included Chief Secretary Li Dachao, secretaries Zhang Yuliang, Li Wanyao, Gu Shangrui, Zhou Songhe, Chen Shuo, Wei Jianxin, Zhang Xiamin, Zhu Shengyang, Song Zheng, Lu Zhangyan, and Liu Songtao. Chairman Li Dachao presided over the meeting, and Chen Shuo served as the recorder. The Chairman's report briefly stated that the various fundraising teams were actively engaged in their efforts and were continuously submitting their achievements. He expressed his hope that the field secretaries would understand the environment in which the team leaders, deputy team leaders, and members were operating, and would devise more methods to assist them in their work, so that the fundraising efforts would become increasingly vigorous. He emphasized that the future of the nation and the people depended on their success. Regarding donations, the hotel industry had been collecting donations since last year, and the hotels throughout the city had enthusiastically supported the effort, with travelers eagerly contributing, resulting in excellent results. The inspectors should supervise this effort at all times and in all places, maintaining this spirit and moving forward bravely to complete the fundraising work as soon as possible. The collection of donations from the freight transport industry has proceeded smoothly, and the chairman and executive committee members of the association have been enthusiastic and diligent. It is expected that the results will be very impressive. Since the collection of donations from the stevedoring industry began, the majority of vehicle operators and customers have actively participated, and the results have been good. The first batch of donations has already been submitted to this office. However, a small number of vehicle operators have delayed payment. In addition to dispatching inspectors to provide guidance, the relevant public security bureau police stations are requested to assist in urging them to submit their payments as soon as possible. It has been reported that payments have been made one after another. Following reports from the field secretaries on the progress of their work, the meeting discussed various approaches for fundraising and donation, and adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>

<h3>The China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association Hosted the Press Last Night</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association hosted a banquet for reporters from various newspapers at the Deng Tuomo Hotel on Ningbo Road last night. Reporters from Shen Bao, Xin Bao, and other newspapers attended and were warmly received by the standing committee members of the association. The banquet began at 7:30 PM. Mr. Yuan Ludeng of the association stood up first and expressed his gratitude to the reporters for their presence and spoke of the necessity to maintain the national cigarette industry, relying on the guidance and assistance of the press for promotion. Subsequently, Mr. Shen Weiting and Mr. Wang Xiaolai of the association delivered sincere speeches. Finally, Mr. Yan Duhe was elected by the reporters to give a reply. Toasts were raised repeatedly, and the guests and hosts parted joyfully at around 10:00 PM. The details of the gathering are recorded below.</p>
<p>List of Guests: Reporters from various newspapers included Ma Chonggan, Zhao Junhao, Jin Huating, Huang Jiping, Hu Zhongchi (all from Shen Bao), Li Haoran, Yan Duhe, Quan Kongwo, Jiang Xiyi (all from Xinwen Bao), Teng Shugu, Zong Dao (both from Shibao), He Xiya, Wu Han, Yang Yucheng (all from Chen Bao), Huang Tianpeng, Nie Shiqi (both from Shishi Xinbao), Qian Cangshuo, Wu Zhongyi (both from Min Bao), Zhang Ruogu, Cui Wanqiu, Zhu Chaoran (all from Da Wan Bao), Li Wu (from Zhonghua Ribao).</p>
<p>List of Hosts: Those responsible for hosting from the association included Yuan Ludeng, Wang Xiaolai, Shen Weiting, Bao Gengsheng, Ding Zhenbo, Shen Xuewen, Shen Xingde, Wang Junzhi, Ding Houqing, Wu Linzhi, Jing Yimeng, Sun Daosheng, and committee members Wu Peiyin and Gong Weiguan.</p>
<p>Speech by Shen Weiting: Tonight, our association has prepared this humble feast to entertain reporters from various newspapers. We are deeply honored that you have not hesitated to brave the summer heat to grace us with your presence and offer your guidance. I would now like to briefly present the purpose of maintaining national cigarettes for your consideration. Although cigarettes are a consumable item, their need is quite widespread in general social circumstances. Therefore, they are also popular in European and American countries. England and the United States are also famous tobacco-producing regions. The number of cigarettes and tobacco leaves exported each year is very large, accounting for an important position in foreign trade. Therefore, the government promotes and encourages it to help promote the development of the rural economy. As for the tobacco producing areas in our country, there are many. Their situation is similar to that of England and the United States. However, tobacco farmers often stick to old ways and do not know how to improve, resulting in slightly inferior quality. Therefore, for the sake of revitalizing the rural economy, tobacco leaves should be improved, and national cigarettes should be maintained. In other words, maintaining national cigarettes is also to revive the rural economy. From the perspective of the business conditions of Chinese cigarette factories, they have gradually felt sluggish in the most recent past few years. Since February of this year, they have felt a sharp decline and things have gotten worse. Shutdowns are frequently heard, and those who are lucky enough to be at work are also in a precarious situation due to sluggish sales. The general downturn is imaginable. There are many reasons for its cause, but the price cuts and competitive sales of foreign goods are the biggest reason. Today, Chinese factories are in a difficult situation, and it is increasingly difficult to support them. If they do not rise up together and seek to save them, then great difficulties will be on the rise. If unfortunately all Chinese factories collapse, not only will the right to operate the cigarette business be lost, but also more than 100,000 workers will be unemployed, and tobacco farmers will also feel panicked. Looking to the future, I cannot help but feel terrified. This is another reason why national cigarettes urgently need to be maintained. However, the way to maintain them depends on the collective efforts of everyone, and publicity and promotion are especially important. Newspapers are a powerful tool for propaganda, surpassing even three thousand Mauser rifles. Moreover, Shanghai is the center of national public opinion, and the newspapers are popular throughout the country. A loud call can change the views and opinions of society. Now that national cigarettes are in a dangerous position, please, based on your enthusiasm for protecting industry and promoting national products, do your best to support us, promote widely, and hope to give us some guidance to correct our shortcomings, so that the business of national cigarettes can be developed and promoted. We will be very grateful.</p>
<p>Speech by Yuan Ludeng: Briefly speaking, I believe that the national cigarette industry has had a vigorous appearance since the May 30th Movement. At this time, when the global economic downturn is sweeping, there is bound to be a feeling of past and present. The capital side may still be able to endure the pain and wait for the opportunity, but the labor side may not be able to cope. Therefore, today's maintenance is really more for the sake of the workers in the cigarette factory.</p>
<p>Speech by Wang Xiaolai: Briefly speaking, starting to maintain the national cigarette industry today is like mending the fold after the sheep is lost. It is too late, and the dream of brilliance has become a memory. It is a pity to say. I have put in a lot of effort into this industry, and all colleagues know the details. I remembered my twenty-fourth birthday, just at the time of the Restoration and the removal of braids. I needed half a tin of cigarettes a day. On that day, I got rid of my cigarette addiction. But for fellow smokers, they must smoke national cigarettes, and they must maintain it.</p>
<p>Speech by Yan Duhe: Briefly speaking, I have listened to the great views of everyone just now and admire them very much. Mr. Xiaolai’s self-narration of his story of quitting cigarettes is especially enough to set an example. Not many people in the world can do what he says and does. Speaking of myself, I need cigarettes every day, and my smoking amount is several times that. I have resolved to quit smoking five or six times, but I have never succeeded. Judging others by myself, there are certainly many people who are similar to me, or who have never thought of quitting. Cigarettes are a social need. It is a fact that smoking national cigarettes can greatly benefit tobacco farmers, and cigarette merchants are secondary. As for the press to promote national industrial and commercial industries, it is its natural duty, and it is not unique to the national cigarette industry. The news industry cannot transcend the world, and it must prosper together with the prosperity of various national industries. Therefore, our press is very happy to do its duty to promote national cigarettes. On behalf of the press, I would like to toast the national cigarette industry and wish it a gradual transition from maintenance to prosperity.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Cholera Prevention Temporary Office Notice No. 2</h3>
<p>(1) Four weeks ago, this office issued Cholera Notice No. 1. To date, no true cholera cases have been found in Shanghai or elsewhere. Fecal samples from patients with gastroenteritis in Nanchang, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Ningbo, and other places have been tested bacteriologically and found to be non-cholera.</p>
<p>(2) Suspected cholera cases continue to occur in Shantou and Xiamen. On July 6th, Shantou and Xiamen each had one death, but neither was confirmed as true cholera. So far this year, it can be said that there is no cholera year.</p>
<p>(3) On July 18th, Shanghai newspapers carried a news item stating that two true cholera patients had been found in the Chinese Isolation Hospital on Huade Road, and that both had been cured within a few hours. After investigation, it was found that the whole thing was fabricated.</p>
<p>(4) The major floods in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins have caused great disasters. As a result, some newspapers have speculated that cholera may break out, but this is completely unfounded. The term "cholera" refers to an infectious disease caused by true cholera bacteria (i.e., Koch's comma bacillus). Ordinary summer gastroenteritis should not be hastily called cholera. In the past, the misuse of this term has unnecessarily restricted our country's commercial transportation and caused our country to be regarded as a source of evil epidemics.</p>
<p>(5) The highest temperature this summer was 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit (July 14th) and 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (July 15th). Last year's highest temperature was 104.4 degrees Fahrenheit (July 12th). However, the humidity has been very high this summer, averaging over 90 daily, while last year it was below 90 for several days.</p>
<p>(6) Isolation hospitals in various districts have been opened to prevent emergencies. However, there are no true cholera patients, and even common gastroenteritis cases are not numerous. For example, the Xizang Road Isolation Hospital has only used saline injections forty times so far. Although there have been a few cases of heatstroke deaths among Chinese and Westerners, heatstroke cases are not common.</p>
<p>(7) The health authorities continue to make efforts to prevent cholera and other summer diseases. It must be said that the intellectual class still has some misunderstandings about the fact that watermelons and flies spread disease. Therefore, although locally produced melons and fruits are inexpensive and beautiful, overly cautious people are often willing to pay two yuan for imported fruits, while buying local products costs only two jiao. Some people think that the roots of melons in polluted fields can absorb bacteria, which is an overestimation. Only cut melons and fruits that are sprinkled with sewage or contaminated by contaminated flies and hands pose a risk of spreading infectious diseases, and only flies containing bacteria are dangerous.</p>
<p>(8) The number of people vaccinated against cholera is as follows: Shanghai City (as of July 23rd) 209,108, French Concession (as of July 25th) 62,440, International Settlement (as of June 30th) 84,883, Health Department of the Two Roads Bureau (as of May 31st) 8,543, totaling 464,974 people.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Organizes Verification and Exchange of Stamp Tax Tickets, Opens for Business on August 1st, First Handles the Procedures for Assembling and Verifying</h3>
<p>Regarding the exchange of old stamp tax tickets for new tickets, since the City Chamber of Commerce received the Ministry of Finance's announcement of the exchange method, it has now begun preparations. It has been decided that the collection and verification will begin on August 1st, and a verification and exchange of stamp tax tickets office will be organized on the first floor of the chamber. Staff have been assigned to handle it, as detailed below.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Public Notice</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce issued a public notice stating that the Ministry of Finance has formulated six articles on the method of exchanging old stamp tax tickets for new tickets, which have been published in the newspaper. According to Article 2 of the method, old tickets that were registered last year and have been returned to the accounts for storage in accordance with the regulations must still be collected by the Chamber of Commerce first, and the commissioners dispatched by the provincial bureau will conduct detailed verification and seal them in the Chamber of Commerce for monthly exchange for new stamp tax tickets in accordance with Article 1. The current first step is to re-collect the registered old tickets that have been returned, verify them, and seal them before they can be exchanged for new tickets. Therefore, this notice is for all accounts that registered old stamp tax tickets in this chamber last year. Please submit the registered old stamp tax tickets to the Old Ticket Verification Office of this chamber starting from August 1st to await verification and sealing by the provincial committee in preparation for exchanging them for new tickets. The office hours of this chamber are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day except holidays. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Assigned Staff</p>
<p>The Stamp Tax Ticket Verification and Exchange Office organized by the Chamber of Commerce will also begin operations on August 1st. The Standing Committee assigned the following staff yesterday: Zhang Yukun from the Commercial Affairs Department, Zhang Lishen from the Finance Department, Yang Baoru from the Exhibition Hall, and Zhu Qirong. They will first discuss the verification and exchange procedures today in order to proceed with the handling.</p>
<h3>Various Charitable Organizations Receive Tragic Reports of Flood Disasters from Various Provinces</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association: Since this month, we have received telegrams from the Yellow River and Yangtze River areas, reporting that either entire cities have been submerged or that the land has been a vast expanse of water, all urgently requiring rescue. These have been compiled and reported in previous newspapers. The association has recently received further reports from various disaster areas, which are excerpted below: (1) The Juye County Government of Shandong Province telegraphed: "Heaven has afflicted Juye, and disasters have occurred year after year. This time, the Yellow River breached its banks at Dongzhuang in Juancheng, and the torrents rushed down, covering the fields. On the same day, it entered from the northwest of the county, irrigating Kangji and Taiping to the north, and rushing through Longhe to the south, and crossing the Zhu River to the east, surrounding the county seat. All six regions of Tai Kang, the majority of the Great Righteousness Yushan regions, and other regions have been submerged. The water is eight or nine feet deep on flat ground. Sorghum, grains, and beans have all been submerged. Houses and stored grains have been washed away, and the number of people and livestock drowned is countless. The disaster area is 120 li long from east to west and 30 to 40 li wide from north to south, affecting over 800 villages and approximately 200,000 disaster victims. They are scattered everywhere, and their plight is unbearable to witness. In addition to the county's urgent relief efforts and the diversion and accommodation of victims, we urgently request the swift allocation of relief funds to save the remaining survivors." (2) Gao Xiangfu and others, disaster victims from Jining County, Shandong Province, telegraphed: "The Yellow River has breached its banks, and the floodwaters have flowed south, from Jining to Jincheng and then to Tengyi. The disaster area is over 200 li in both directions. Most of the villages in between have been engulfed, and no grains have been left in the large fields. Over 2 million disaster victims have suddenly lost their homes and are forced to sleep in the open and eat in the wind, making their plight unbearable. We respectfully plead on behalf of the people for swift relief." (3) The government of Duchang County, Jiangxi Province, telegraphed on behalf of the people: "Our county is located along Poyang Lake and is naturally low-lying. Unexpectedly, in the last ten days of last month, heavy rains came down like pouring water, causing mountain floods and a sharp rise in the lake level. The entire area is a vast expanse of water, becoming a swamp. Fields and houses have been submerged, and livestock and property have been washed away. This kind of catastrophe is unprecedented in decades. Most of the refugees are temporarily living in the mountains, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open, with their livelihoods cut off. They are suffering from heat and cold, and deaths are occurring one after another. Their plight is so tragic that Zheng Xia could not depict it. We are appealing for the dispatch of personnel to the county to distribute urgent relief and save the people." (4) The Water Disaster Relief Committee of Yuan'an County, Hubei Province, wrote: "The disaster area of this flood in our county is vast, extending from Naxiangcheng in the north to Dangyang in the south, covering over a hundred li. Cities and towns have been turned into swamps. Not only crops and livestock have been swept away, but also the elderly and young people have been swept away by the waves. There are corpses piled up in ditches everywhere. Disaster victims have no place to live and no food to eat. Their cries of hunger are everywhere, and they are eagerly waiting for food. We are begging for urgent relief." (5) The Wu Zhen Chamber of Commerce and various groups in Nanzhang County, Hubei Province, reported: "On July 3rd, there were five days and nights of continuous rain in our town, causing mountain floods that submerged the model towns of Wufeng and other towns, and the villages of Foshan and other townships. Some parts of Lingxi and other townships were also submerged. The area of over 50 li has become a swamp. Over 8,000 households have been engulfed, over 1,000 people have drowned, over 200 people have been crushed to death by collapsed houses, and tens of thousands of mu of fields have been submerged. The disaster situation is extremely serious, unprecedented. Disaster victims are on the roads, crying for food. We are begging for relief." (6) The Fifth District Temporary Disaster Relief Committee of Qianjiang County, Hubei Province, wrote: "On the 8th of this month, the embankment near Zhongxiang Shiergong breached, and the water rushed down, with Qianjiang County directly in its path. The water level was over two zhang high. The people were unable to escape, and their fields, houses, livestock, and people were all swept away by the waves. The number of people and livestock drowned is countless. It is estimated that there are over 10,000 households and 80,000 people in the entire district. No household is complete, and no family is whole. The dead are already gone, and the living are eating in the wind and drinking dew. It seems that those who do not die in the water will also die of hunger. We are making this appeal and pleading for relief."</p>
<p>The Chinese Jiesheng Society recently received a telegram from Peng Zhanyuan and Wang Chenge Yang Liu Zhao, representatives from Juancheng, Yuncheng, Juhe, and Heze counties in Shandong Province, stating: "The Shandong region, including Zhencheng, Heze, Yuncheng, and Juye counties, has suffered repeated Yellow River disasters, numbering seven times. This year is the most severe. On the 10th of this month, the Yellow River suddenly breached its banks at Dongzhuang on the east bank of Juancheng County, directly cutting through the county borders of Juancheng, Heze, Yuncheng, and Juye to the east. The roads it passed through were still the areas that had been affected by the previous six disasters. The torrents surged, as if galloping horses. In one day and night, hundreds of li were submerged. Hundreds of villages were lost, with depths exceeding a zhang in deeper areas and a chi in shallower areas. Houses were swept away, and countless people and livestock were drowned. Cries of woe are everywhere, and all the people have become subjects of the waves. Starvation and drowning are intertwined, and the survivors have no way to continue their lives. Life and death are permanently separated. Some have lost their white-haired parents and cannot care for their families. Some have abandoned their nursing children. Those who are fortunate enough to escape are crowded on the embankments. They have no place to live or eat. Those who are trapped and have not come out are sleeping in the open ruins of villages. They are in urgent need of rescue. In addition, continuous rain has worsened the situation, with torrential downpours occurring frequently. The god of wind is stubborn and frequently raises huge waves. They are exposed to rain and wind, and their figures are haggard. The situation is tragic and unbearable to witness. If relief is not provided quickly, the millions of disaster victims who have not yet died will soon fill the ditches. We beg you to open your benevolent hearts and join us in this good deed. Please quickly send funds and dispatch personnel to provide relief to save the survivors, etc." The association provided tens of thousands of yuan in relief during the Heze County flood two years ago. This year, too many counties have been submerged, and we urgently want to provide relief and rescue. We have not yet raised enough funds and have prepared 1,000 bottles of Jiesheng Dan to send to Heze County to urgently treat the sick. If we can raise a significant amount of relief funds, we will carefully arrange urgent relief to save the victims from this tragic disaster. Compassionate and virtuous people at home and abroad, please open your wallets and create blessings. Why not come?</p>
<h3>Seventy-Third Batch of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to Implement Relief Plan</h3>
<p>The seventy-third batch of four overseas Chinese expelled from Japan arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Jian Jinglun, director of the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, previously suggested to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission a plan to provide relief to the overseas Chinese. The plan is scheduled to be implemented, and a reporter from the Industrial and Commercial News Agency has learned the details, which are detailed below.</p>
<p>More Overseas Chinese Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>The seventy-third batch of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan, Chen Shaoyu, Zhou Xianren (from Ruian, Zhejiang), Liu Tingzhai, and Chen Zhuoqing (from Qingtian, Zhejiang), arrived in Shanghai on the Tsukuba Maru of the Japan Post Steamship Company from Tokyo yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The ship docked at the Osaka Wharf, and they disembarked and temporarily resided in the Lao Gongxin Hotel on the 16th Pier. Their situation is pitiful. It is reported that the overseas Chinese intend to request registration with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau today so that they can cultivate land in the Qiaole Village.</p>
<p>Relief Plan Scheduled for Implementation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, in view of the fact that the returning overseas Chinese have suffered unemployment, displacement, and extreme suffering, and in order to implement relief, previously joined forces with the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss relief measures. Director Jian of the bureau also drafted a relief plan for the overseas Chinese and went to Beijing to suggest it to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, so that diplomatic and domestic affairs could be carried out in unison. At the same time, the diplomatic authorities will negotiate with various countries regarding anti-Chinese incidents. This plan is a matter of urgency for providing relief to the overseas Chinese and is expected to be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Taoist General Society Relief Team Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The floods in the Yellow River and the Yangtze River have been severe, and the livelihood of the Chinese people is difficult. Although there have been initiatives to raise relief funds, according to various reports, the amount collected is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Mr. Chen Ruiqi, president of the Hong Kong Taoist General Society, has personally donated tens of thousands of yuan and has voluntarily organized the Taoist Relief Team. He has appointed the society's staff members Chen Zhonghao, Zhao Dongyuan, Huang Hengjie, Feng Zaisheng, and Li Xiangquan to take the funds and medicines to Jinan to handle relief matters. The team members arrived in Shanghai on the 28th and are temporarily using the Dadong Hotel as a temporary office. They are scheduled to transfer north within the next few days.</p>
<h3>Shops on Two Roads in the French Concession Request Landlords to Voluntarily Reduce Rent; Sent Letters to Landlords Yesterday Explaining Difficult Circumstances</h3>
<p>Shops along Caishi Road and Route Paul Beau in the French Concession, considering the market to be depressed and affected by road construction, making it difficult to maintain operations, have unanimously requested relief from the French authorities and rent reductions, as previously reported. It is now learned that the rent reduction delegation of the shopkeepers and residents of the two roads sent letters yesterday to the landlords in the area, including Ji Zhenyu Company, Wing On Real Estate Company, Ruiji Company, Chen Yueting, Junyi Industrial Company, Yuelai Company, Thiele &amp; Co., Chen Sanlin, Yuanchang Company, Xu Linji, Qin Xijiu, Shunji Company, Ruizheng Company, Sino-French Bank, Continental Property Management, Xingji Company, Gan Yifeng, Banque de l'Indochine, Thiele Company, Gu Lanji, Rixin Sheng, Xieji Company, Junji Company, Hanzhuang Jiyi Public Association, Jiyi Real Estate Company, Hengji Company, Tian Hongsheng, Lawyer Xu Shihao, Lin Shuangquan, China Industrial Bank, Rendao Company, and more than thirty other landlords, requesting them to voluntarily implement rent reductions. The original letter is recorded below: Respected Sirs, In recent years, Shanghai has been hit by the global economic downturn and the impact of rural bankruptcy in the interior, resulting in a depressed market that worsens daily and an extremely difficult social economy. As a result, finance is stagnant and shops are closing one after another. Shanghai, once known as the most prosperous city in the country, has turned into a desolate ancient ruin. Those who are operating shops in Shanghai today, in order to save the critical situation, have to lower their prices to attract customers and reduce their expenses to maintain the status quo. Although they try every possible means, they are ultimately unable to sustain themselves, because rent is too high, accounting for a large portion of their expenses. The meager profits they earn through cheap sales are all used to pay rent, and they are still worried about not having enough. Or, because they are unable to pay the rent, their businesses are sealed up and unable to reopen, which is also common. This is all because the rent is too high, which is a major reason for not being able to restore prosperity. The shops along Caishi Road and Route Paul Beau, which belong to this delegation, are all in a precarious situation due to the high rent. Recently, the French tram company has been repairing the roads for no reason, and the accumulation of mud and soil has blocked traffic. The shops that already have sluggish business are now facing this unexpected blow, which makes it even more difficult to sustain. We have no choice but to ask the landlords to understand. Therefore, the shops on Caishi Road and Route Paul Beau, forced by the environment, have passed a resolution at the general meeting of all shop representatives to elect representatives to form this delegation, and have decided on the following rent reduction standards: (1) For the six months of May, June, July, August, September, and October this year, due to road construction, please landlords reduce the original rent by 50%. (2) From November onwards, collect 70% of the rent. (3) Once the market improves, the original rent will be restored immediately. The above measures have been unanimously approved and submitted to this delegation to request each landlord to voluntarily implement them. It has been found that the rent of your valuable shop houses on Caishi Road and Route Paul Beau is indeed expensive. This special letter is to inform you that we hope that your valuable landlord will deeply understand the difficult times and immediately implement the above rent reduction measures to maintain the market and prevent public resentment.</p>
<h3>French Concession Rickshaw Pullers Petition the Municipal Council Today; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Accepts the Request and Sends Representatives to Accompany Them</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, there are a total of 17,000 public rickshaws in the French Concession (in addition to the 9,990 licenses in the International Settlement). There are approximately 50,000 to 60,000 rickshaw pullers who depend on this for their livelihood. The French Municipal Council is also implementing rickshaw puller registration because the International Settlement is holding rickshaw puller registration. As rickshaw pullers are unwilling to register, the Municipal Council announced that registration will be compulsory from August 1. All the rickshaw pullers are quite dissatisfied with this. On the afternoon of the 28th, a meeting was held in the wasteland of South Wharf, attended by more than 90 representatives, chaired by Shi Changsheng. The resolutions were: 1. Unanimously oppose registration; 2. Send representatives to petition the guild.</p>
<p>Representatives Petition</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the rickshaw pullers specially dispatched representatives Shi Changsheng, Zhao Shujing, Zhou Yongcai, Yang Fenghao, Yang Yougui, and others, with a written petition, to the Rickshaw Pullers' Guild in Sanminfang. The standing committee member of the guild, Song Yaokun, received them. The rickshaw puller representatives first stated that the representative meeting had resolved to inform the rickshaw pullers to refuse registration. If the owners want to force registration, they would rather give up the life of pulling rickshaws and requested that justice be upheld. The guild representative agreed to reply after discussion.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Mediation</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the guild specially dispatched representatives Qiu Chunshan, Zhang Huaiyang, Yu Dajin, and others, with a written petition, to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. They first stated that the rickshaw pullers absolutely oppose registration, and the French Municipal Council’s announcement also ordered the owners to force the rickshaw pullers to register. If the rickshaw pullers do not apply for registration within the deadline, the vehicles will be detained and returned after the rickshaw pullers register. The owners really cannot bear this responsibility. The clerk of the Commerce Section, Yuan Hongjun, received them and promised to accompany them to the French Municipal Council tomorrow (today) to request a change of the method. The guild has appointed Song Yaokun, Zhang Huaiyang, and Yu Dajin as representatives to go to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM and accompany the Chamber of Commerce representatives to petition the French Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>China Travel Service Continues to Organize Second Lotus Viewing Tour</h3>
<p>The Shanghai China Travel Service organized a lotus viewing tour to Zhengyi and Qingyang Port on the 28th of this month, with a quota of 100 people. The registration was very enthusiastic, and the quota was filled in three days, causing latecomers to feel regret. Furthermore, the company frequently received letters from all walks of life requesting an increase in the quota. After careful consideration, the company added 30 more places, so the number of people on the lotus viewing tour on the 28th totaled 130. Recently, the company continues to receive letters from all walks of life requesting a second lotus viewing tour, so it will continue to organize a second Zhengyi Qingyang Port lotus viewing tour on August 4 (Sunday) to thank everyone for their kindness. It is reported that the travel fee is still one dollar and fifty cents per person, including round-trip transportation and lunch. The departure time is 9:00 AM on August 4, lunch will be at the Qingyang Port Garden Hotel, and the return to Shanghai is at 6:35 PM. The Sichuan Road branch has brochures available for collection.</p>

<h3>Major Fire at Yangjia Ferry, Pudong; Three to Four Hundred Straw Sheds Burned Down Within Two Hours; Over a Thousand Disaster Victims Crying Along the Road</h3>
<p>At 8:30 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the Nan Shou Beifan Nitantang area of Yangjia Ferry, Pudong. Within two hours, three to four hundred straw sheds were burned down, and more than a thousand people were affected, a true disaster. The details are recorded below. Repeated Fires It is found that the Caonitang area is divided into north and south, separated by the Xiaobang River. The buildings in both places are straw sheds built by people from other provinces. In the past six or seven years, there have been three major fires, each time destroying hundreds of straw sheds, causing superstitious people to regard it as a fiery place. However, after each disaster, the situation soon returned to its original state, because these people from other provinces have nowhere else to live and take the Caonitang area as the basis of their lives.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire Again At 8:30 PM yesterday, the straw houses were all flammable, and in an instant, the fire became a prairie fire, impossible to control. After Yang Zhongquan, the director of the Yangjia Ferry Police Station, heard the report, he urgently telegraphed various fire departments for assistance and dispatched police officers Lin and Yang to the fire scene to maintain order. Soon, Zhao Longsheng, director of the Pudong District Fire Association, drove his men to the scene to put out the fire, but the Xiaobang River was at low tide, and no water could be found nearby, leaving the firefighters helpless. After negotiation, the Dadeshin Oil Factory in the north agreed to provide water, and after connecting a few lengths of hose, water was finally obtained.</p>
<p>Burning Dozens of Acres At this time, fire trucks from Yangjing Town Fire Association, Wu Yi Zhan, Lao Bei Du, and other places all gathered at the scene to assist, but the flames became more and more fierce. In addition, the southeast wind was quite strong, and several dragons of water were ineffective. Moreover, the hoses of the Pudong District and Yangjing Town broke several times due to excessive water pressure, making it more difficult. The fire continued to burn until about 10:30 PM. The area of the fire was even wider than the previous few times. It is estimated that it extended east to the intersection of Fukang Road, south to the riverside, west to the foot of the Taikai wall, and north to the tile houses of Xiechang East and West Lane, covering an area of several tens of acres. All the straw sheds in the area were swept away. Fortunately, the firefighters did their best to protect the tile houses in Xiechang Lane, and the fire could not spread and subsided. Otherwise, if the fire spread to the north, the consequences would be even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>Sounds of Lamentation After the fire broke out, nearby residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, rescued their belongings. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the fire scene was full of winding paths, which were extremely difficult to walk. In addition, the onlookers blocked the way. Fortunately, the police maintained order effectively, and the disaster victims walked out along Fukang Road, Daqing Street, and Caonitang Road in several places. The sounds of lamentation along the way were endless, and the situation was extremely miserable.</p>
<p>Cause Unknown The cause of the fire and which family was responsible is still unknown because the fire broke out suddenly and the police station in charge was unable to determine it for the time being. It is only known that a foreman named Wu is suspected, but it is difficult to confirm. Director Yang was afraid that the arsonist would escape to other places, so after the fire was extinguished, he first brought Wang to the station for questioning.</p>
<p>Relief Measures The fire lasted for about two hours and destroyed about three to four hundred straw sheds, affecting more than a thousand people. Most of them are civilians from other provinces, mostly working as coolies at the docks, extremely poor. After their homes were destroyed, most of them will have nowhere to live, so relief measures are very urgent. It is reported that Director Yang will still follow the previous disaster relief methods and consult with various Shanghai charities for relief.</p>
<h3>The Municipality Adds Civilian Housing; Construction of Three Sites to be Completed This Year</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government established the Civilian Welfare Committee, it has been actively planning for civilian welfare projects. The first project to be implemented is civilian housing. The civilian housing on Qimei Road has been contracted by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and construction has begun. It is expected to be completed by the end of September and leased to civilians. Currently, there are many civilians in the city, scattered in various places, so one location on Qimei Road is not enough. Therefore, the Municipal Government has continued to survey three other locations on Pusan Road, Zhongshan Road, and Damuqiao Road, designated land, and will build more civilian housing. All evaluation and purchase matters will be handled by the Land Bureau under the instructions of the Municipal Government. Once the purchase is completed, contractors can be hired to start construction. It is expected that construction will be completed within this year.</p>
<h3>Lumber Industry in the French Concession Resolves to Oppose Sanitary Tax; Representatives Appointed to Petition</h3>
<p>The lumber merchants in the French Concession received a notice from the French Municipal Council that each lumber company must apply for a classified business sanitary license and pay a review fee of ten yuan, etc. The lumber companies believe that they have been operating for many years, and the cancellation has been strongly advocated by the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association. At a time when the market is extremely depressed and shops are unable to sustain themselves, they must pay for the license, which is difficult to accept. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the guild, requesting it to forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for relief, and also requested the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association and the Citizens' Federation to uphold justice and demand that the French authorities strive to cancel the tax. It is now learned that each lumber company suddenly received a notice from a Westerner a few days ago, stating that they should apply for the license from the bureau this week, otherwise the police station will be notified for punishment. Each lumber company was very frightened, so at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they convened a temporary emergency meeting of each lumber company at the Citizens' Association on Route Paul Beau to discuss countermeasures. Attendees included Tongyu, Fuxing, Lida, Hongda, Hetai, Yinji, Chengda, Lixing, Zhengda, Xietai, Wanfeng, Maosheng, and more than thirty other companies. Tongyu's Lin Zhengtang was elected as chairman to report on the efforts to seek assistance from all parties, and to report on the subsequent notice from the Westerner that the police station would punish them, and how to deal with it, and asked everyone to discuss it. After the representatives of each industry expressed their opinions, they decided on countermeasures: (1) This industry has never paid taxes, and the attachment table of the classified business regulations does not have any regulations for this industry. The cancellation has also been negotiated before. All of these are proofs that this industry should not pay for the license, and it is decided to deny it to the end. Any oppression will not be recognized, and everyone will sign on the spot to express their determination. (2) Lin Zhengtang and Huang Zhixian were appointed as representatives to petition the relevant national bodies for relief at a fixed time when necessary. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Lotus Blossoms in Zhengyi and Qingyang Port; Beautiful Flowers Fill the Pond and Fragrance Fills the Stream</h3>
<p>The Heavenly Bamboo lotus of the Tongdi variety in the Gu Garden East Pavilion of Zhengyi, and the newly planted Thousand Petal White Lotus, and the Tongdi lotus flowers in the Qingyang Port Railway Garden Hotel, the beauty and preciousness of which have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper, are now in full bloom in both places. The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has also provided special trains to facilitate travel, so the number of men and women from this port and the Su-Kun area who go to admire the lotus flowers is increasing daily. According to a tourist who returned to Shanghai from admiring the lotus flowers in the two places, the original Tongdi lotus in the East Pavilion has red-purple petals and is rich in Longsheng, and the newly planted Thousand Lotus flower is as white as snow and wins with its elegance. The Tongdi lotus in the pond of the Qingyang Port Railway Garden Hotel is well-protected and well-cultivated, with almost every branch and every flower doubled, and some stems have four or even six flowers, with bright colors all over the ground and a refreshing fragrance. This color and this fragrance can only be appreciated by those who are on the scene.</p>
<h3>Shareholder of Tongqing Exchange Discovers Manager Embezzling More Than 500,000; Reports to Police Station; Manager Xia Guichu and Others Arrested; Court Opened Trial Yesterday to Obtain Evidence of Fraud</h3>
<p>Tongqing Exchange at No. 180 Ningbo Road is a financial giant jointly established by Xu Liantang, Qin Xianfu, Qin Xianfu, Li Hongquan, etc. Each share is valued at 30,000 yuan in national currency. It opened in the spring of the Republic of China in the 13th year. Xia Guichu from Ningbo was hired as manager, and Zhu Haichu from Huzhou was hired as assistant manager. Since its opening, it has suffered huge losses. Recently, after the shareholders checked the accounts, they discovered that Xia and Zhu had major fraud and embezzled public funds. The total amount reached 534,393.23 yuan. Therefore, they entrusted Lawyer Eson to report to the Chief Patrol Room. The police station requested the First Special District Court to sign an arrest warrant. A Chinese detective named Chen Yaoting was sent to Tongqing Exchange to arrest Xia and Zhu. They were temporarily detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court. Defendant Xia Guichu hired lawyers Fan Gang and Zhao Fuding, and Zhu Haichu hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Wang Shudong as defenders. Tongqing Exchange, accompanied by Lawyer Eson, filed a civil suit. First, the police lawyer Jiang Baokang stated that the police station, after receiving the reporter's report, requested the court to issue an arrest warrant and arrested the two on the previous day. Now the police station is prosecuting them for the crime under Article 335 of the Criminal Law. The following is a brief statement of the defendants' crimes: (1) From October 30th last year to July 29th this year, Xia Guichu obtained public bonds of 100,000, 50,000, and 692,000 yuan from the chief accountant Dong Jinghong on three occasions, with receipts, as capital for his private speculative business. (2) In July last year, Xia used the name of Taiji in Ningbo to mortgage 100,000 yuan to Tongqing. Now, including interest, he owes 103,950.73 yuan. It is found that Taiji is actually Xia's alias. Xia also mortgaged a package of square receipts worth 8,393 yuan to Tongqing for a loan of 96,607 yuan. (3) At the end of last year, Taichang, Tongyu, and Xinyuan deposited public bonds worth 157,660 yuan to Tongqing. When they came to retrieve them in March this year, the public bonds were missing. Tongqing compensated them with public bonds of the same value. However, it is still being investigated whether the public bonds were actually deposited or taken by the defendant. (4) A Ruizhi client mortgaged public bonds with a face value of 20,000 yuan to Tongqing for 12,000 yuan. The public bonds were also cashed in by Xia. In summary, the total amount of funds embezzled by the defendants is 534,393.23 yuan. The defendants also confessed in the police station. Then, the Tongqing shareholders stated that they had three shares in Tongqing, totaling 90,000 yuan, but due to the defendants' fraud, each share now requires about 300,000 yuan, causing all shareholders to be ruined and their property mortgaged in order to repay the external debts. Tongqing opened in the spring of the 23rd year, and all the staff in the store belonged to the defendants, so it was difficult to detect the fraud in the accounts. Lawyer Wu Linkan then asked about the manager's authority. The reply was that according to the custom of the money industry, the manager has dictatorial powers, that is, even the shareholders cannot interfere with his duties or check the accounts. Lawyer Zhao Fuding also asked Wang whether the store had set up two supervisors, Wang Zhongyun and Qin Xianfu, to supervise the manager's accounts, but Wang denied it. Questioning Xia Guichu's confession, the plaintiff's accusations were entirely losses from buying and selling public bonds, not embezzlement by us. The public bonds deposited by Taichang and other three companies were sold during the financial crisis to maintain the store's operations. As for the several accounts under my name, it was because the money industry was extremely panicked at the end of last year, and the store's losses were too great. If it was clearly recorded in the accounts, the news would spread to the outside world and inevitably lead to a run on the store. Therefore, after consulting with the supervisors, a portion of the accounts was temporarily transferred to my account as a cover. After the crisis subsided, the accounts would be transferred back, etc. Zhu Haichu confessed that the full authority in the store belonged to the manager, and I had no right to interfere. I resigned from the position of assistant manager at the end of last year. Now I am only assisting in collecting accounts and am not paid. I sometimes knew about Xia Guichu's buying and selling of public bonds, but I did not advise him, etc. The defendants' lawyers then requested permission to post bail. After verifying the confession, Criminal Division Chief Feng Shide decided to postpone the trial for a week. Zhu Haichu was allowed to stop detention with a cash bail of 100,000 yuan or a guarantee of the equivalent amount. Xia Guichu was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Gang Fight in Zhabei; Iron Bars, Axes, and Sharp Knives Used; Three People Seriously Injured and Sent to the General Bureau</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 PM the night before last, dozens of gangsters in the Sun Temple area of Zhabei engaged in a gang fight, each holding iron bars, axes, sharp knives, etc. Police Officer Tang Zijiu of the Sun Temple Police Station No. 40 noticed this and immediately rushed to the station. Inspector Zhang Zhongde then led Police Chief Hu Lianbo, Zhu Liming, Yang Jintang, and others to the scene. When the gangsters saw the police, they fled in all directions. As a result, Zhang Gongqi, Zhang Yongsheng, and Wang A'bao, who were seriously injured, were arrested. Several iron bars found on the roadside were brought back to the station. Inspector Zhang briefly questioned them and then sent them to the Xinzha Sub-bureau. After questioning by Bureau Member Huang Chongren, Zhang Gongqi stated that he was 45 years old, from Henan, and lived at No. 551 Haichang Road. Yesterday (the day before last), Zhang Yongsheng and the owner of the Jin Yu Ji Steel Workshop at the location had a fight. At that time, the steel workshop owner lost. I and someone named Wang came out to mediate. Wang suggested making tea and buying two plasters. I suggested setting up two tables of wine. Later, there was no result. Zhang Yongsheng stated that he was 19 years old, from Changzhou, and lived on Yongxing Xiaoma Road, without knowing the address. This fight was because the copper workshop owner worships the old man Zhang Gongqi. He, as the old man, must save face, so he insisted on setting up twenty tables of wine. Because I could not agree to this condition, he threatened to make me regret it. As a result, yesterday (the day before yesterday), he led many people, each carrying weapons, and beat me, and stabbed my leg several times. Wang A'bao confessed that he was 27 years old, from Suzhou, lived at No. 10 Qia Yu Li, Zhongxing Road, and worked as an electrician. Zhang Gongqi was helping his apprentice. He demanded not only ten tables, but also that Zhang Yongsheng sing for three days. Zhang Yongsheng could not do it, and he said I was not giving him face, so he invited many people to break my head with weapons. After Huang verified, both sides had serious injuries. Zhang Gongqi had severe injuries to his face and arms. Zhang Yongsheng had injuries to both legs, with a total of four stab wounds. Wang A'bao had injuries to his head and hands. They were immediately sent to Shanzhong Hospital for treatment, and the three, Zhang Gongqi, Zhang Yongsheng, and Wang A'bao, together with an iron bar, were sent to the Public Security General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Case Cracked at the Oriental Hotel; Many Gamblers are Reputable Merchants; Boss Zhang Gengsheng Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Yao Jiaquan, the Chinese detective of the Lao Zha Patrol Room, recently received a tip that there was a large-scale gambling den in Room 307 of the Oriental Hotel, 308 Nanjing West Road, profiting from commissions. The gamblers were all reputable merchants, and the stakes were very high. Detective Yao secretly arrested them and arrested the boss Zhang Gengsheng, as well as gamblers Yang Shukang (real estate businessman) from Shanghai, Xiong Mingde from Nanhui, Shao Yaochen (cotton yarn industry) from Wuxi, and Mrs. Yang Dong (the manager of the Rong Binggen Fuxin Flour Factory), etc. There was also a prostitute named Xue Laoba from Suzhou, who was smoking opium, who was also arrested. The mahjong tiles, dominoes, chips, account books, and opium smoking paraphernalia were all confiscated and brought back to the patrol room. Zhang Gengsheng and the opium smoker Xue Laoba were detained separately. The rest were released on bail of 100 yuan each. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baokang explained the situation and prosecuted Zhang Gengsheng based on Article 168 of the Criminal Law and Articles 6 and 10 of the Opium Prohibition Law. Zhang Gengsheng confessed that the room was opened by him, but only mahjong was played and no opium was sold. When questioned, Yang Shukang, Xiong Mingde, Sun Yanru, and Shao Yaochen all confessed to playing mahjong. Xue Laoba denied smoking opium, and Mrs. Yang Dong also denied participating in gambling. After verifying the confessions, Chief Judge Feng Shide sentenced Zhang Gengsheng to one month of imprisonment and a fine of 50 yuan. Xue Laoba was fined 15 yuan. Yang Shukang, Xiong Mingde, Sun Yanru, and Shao Yaochen were each fined 20 yuan. Mrs. Yang Dong was acquitted. All gambling and opium paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Safety Jointly Prohibit Da Jiao</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs believes that in Shanghai, every year between July and August, idlers initiate the Yu Lan Pen Festival (commonly known as Da Jiao) on various roads and lanes, soliciting money from house to house, promoting superstition, and wasting people's money and harming their wealth. At a time when the floods in various provinces are terrible and the victims are in dire need of rescue, it is not appropriate to waste hard-earned money on useless consumption. It is necessary to ban the practice to reverse the bad trend. A few days ago, the Bureau sent personnel to consult with the Bureau of Public Safety. In addition to the joint announcement by the two bureaus, the Bureau of Public Safety also issued orders to all subordinate units to strictly prohibit the practice.</p>
<h3>Minghua Bank Lawsuit Heard Again Yesterday: Tong Jinhui Denies Being Chairman; Plaintiff Requests Inspection of Records</h3>
<p>Minghua Bank, located at Henan Road, Beijing Road, suddenly declared its closure in May of this year due to unfavorable market conditions. Twelve creditors, including Yu Mingyi, Zheng Weimin, and Gu Fengting, hired lawyers Wu Kaisheng and Zheng Wenkai to accuse the bank's chairman, Tong Jinhui, manager Zhang Gangbo, deputy manager Yu Dehua, and assistant manager Miao Zhenfan of fraud and breach of trust. The First Special Court has already held two hearings, but due to the defendants' absence, the court ordered a postponement. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhao of the Eighth Criminal Division continued the hearing. Only Tong Jinhui and Yu Dehua appeared in court. Miao Zhenfan's lawyer, Wang Fu, presented a telegram stating that manager Zhang Gangbo was currently being detained by the Qingdao Municipal Government. Miao Zhenfan was unable to return to Shanghai because of the busy affairs of the Qingdao branch and requested a postponement. Tong Jinhui denied being the chairman or a director. The plaintiff's lawyer requested that the court dispatch bailiffs to Minghua Bank to retrieve the board of directors' meeting minutes and shareholder list to verify whether Tong was the chairman of Minghua or had no connection to it. The defendant's lawyer, Zhu Hongru, stated that after Minghua closed, all important account books were listed and entrusted to accountant Xu Yongzuo and his law firm, Wei Jiong, for safekeeping. Although Minghua Bank repeatedly convened shareholder meetings from 1931 to this year, they all failed due to insufficient attendance to form a quorum. Therefore, since a shareholders' meeting never convened, there were no board members elected. Judge Yang stated that because the defendants were not all present, the case would be postponed. He ordered the case to be reheard on August 16th in the afternoon and granted the plaintiff's lawyer's request to inspect the records.</p>

<h3>Hunan Guild Sends Unemployed Fellow Villagers Back Home; Certificates to be Claimed on the 31st of this Month</h3>
<p>The Hunan Guild at Xieqiao, Hunan, in Shanghai is handling the repatriation of unemployed fellow villagers. With approval according to regulations for refugees, they notified all unemployed workers to register. The Hunan Fellow Villagers Association sent personnel to investigate and telegraphed the Hunan Provincial Government and the Ministry of Railways and Communications, obtaining approval to repatriate the unemployed workers in accordance with regulations for refugees. Yesterday, the Shanghai Hunan Fellow Villagers Association issued a notice stating that the association has investigated and registered all unemployed fellow villagers and telegraphed the Hunan Provincial Government and the Ministry of Railways and Communications, obtaining approval to handle the matter according to regulations for refugees. All those who have registered should come to the Hunan Guild at Xieqiao on the 31st of this month to collect their train or boat tickets. No replacements will be issued after the deadline.

<h3>Journalists' Association Aids Xuzhou Xin Wan Bao</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Association, in order to assist the Xuzhou Xin Wan Bao, resolved in its fourth standing committee meeting to write to the Fourth Branch of the High Court, requesting a fair trial. This has been reported previously. The letter from the association to the Fourth Branch of the High Court is as follows:</p>
<p>Respected Sirs,</p>
<p>We received a letter from Xia Yiming, deputy editor-in-chief of the Xuzhou Xin Wan Bao, stating that their newspaper was sealed by the Ninth District Security Command of Jiangsu Province on June 27th because it published a telegram from a Nanjing newspaper. Editor-in-chief Chen Suyi was detained and sentenced to seven months' imprisonment by the Tongshan County Government, which also handles judicial affairs, on June 30th. An appeal has now been filed. They request our assistance. After discussion at the fourth standing committee meeting, we believe that if the Xin Wan Bao merely reprinted news of "reactionary leaflets appearing in Ping City" from a Nanjing newspaper, then both newspapers are operated by Chinese people and are under the jurisdiction of the central government. It is unlikely that news from a newspaper under central control would constitute a crime if reprinted in a local newspaper. Furthermore, the Tongshan County Government's interrogation and judgment, conducted on a weekend holiday, one day before the establishment of the court, seem to be biased. Since this case has been appealed to your court, we urge you to conduct a fair trial to conform to justice and sentiment.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Journalists' Association</p>
<p>Yan Duhe, Tang Shichang, Jiang Songdao, Jiang Xiangqing, Wang Xinming, Jiang Hongjiao, Zhu Zian.</p>
<h3>Miao Horen Angered by Wife's Infidelity, Shoots and Wounds Paramour; Police Prosecute for Attempted Murder; Miao Chen Admits Adultery</h3>
<p>Miao Horen, a local resident, 38 years old, runs the "Xianrentang" at 236 North Fujian Road, offering medical treatments. On the 27th of this month, at 5:45 AM, Miao, suspecting his wife, Chen (also known as Lin Di), of having an improper relationship with Wang Lianji, a worker at the copper shop next door at 232 North Fujian Road, became enraged. He secretly took a pistol, lured Wang to Yushun Lane on Qipu Road, and shot him, wounding him in the right flank. The International Settlement Police learned of the incident. Detective Shang Wu, along with detectives Zheng Huaili and Li Wenbin, arrested Miao Horen, seizing a pistol and six bullets. The injured Wang Lianji was taken to the Douren Hospital, where doctors found a bullet wound in his right flank and surgically removed the bullet. He was hospitalized for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police prosecuted Miao Horen in the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court for attempted murder under Article 27, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, stating that the defendant was arrested after being reported by the victim, Wang Lianji. During the investigation, the police asked where the gun was hidden. The defendant led them to the home of Sun Rusong at 768 Tianmu Road, where the gun was found hidden inside a shoe cabinet. Sun was not home at the time. Sun's mother stated that Sun was at 580 Lane 14, Weihaiwei Road, on business. The defendant had secretly placed the gun under the bed that morning, and her son was not yet awake, so she was unaware. The police arrested Sun but released him after determining he was not involved. The defendant confessed that he bought the gun from Jin Fushou, who lived on North Fujian Road five years ago. The police arrested Jin, but Jin denied selling the gun, claiming he was being framed. After investigation, the police released Jin as well. The defendant also confessed that because Wang Lianji had an affair with his wife and had secret meetings with her, he plotted to lure Wang out on the pretext of repairing a glass cabinet and shot him in Yushun Lane. Wang is still in the hospital. The case was then postponed, and the gun and bullets were presented as evidence. Questioned, Miao Horen stated that he bought the gun from Jin Fushou for 100 yuan five years ago when he lived on North Fujian Road for self protection as he had once been robbed. He runs the "Xianrentang" on North Fujian Road, treating children's illnesses. Wang Lianji is a worker at the neighboring copper shop. In the past half month, he has been having an affair with my wife, frequently going out together, causing scandalous rumors. For the sake of my reputation, I arranged to meet Wang the previous morning to negotiate. When we arrived at Yushun Lane, I reasoned with Wang, but Wang not only refused to listen but also said that my wife was willingly participating in the affair. Enraged, I drew my gun to scare him. I don't know how, but the bullet went off. I didn't realize Wang had been hit and went home. Later, Wang incited seven or eight colleagues from the shop, all armed, to beat me, causing me to be injured all over. I had no intention of murdering Wang.</p>
<p>Miao Chen, the defendant's wife, stated that she is from Funing, 30 years old, has been married to the defendant for eight years, and has two children. Their relationship was usually harmonious. She admitted to having an affair with Wang Lianji for only about ten days.</p>
<p>Judge Liu Guigui reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days before the next hearing.</p>

<h3>After Scientific Identification, Concealed Inheritance Revealed; Confirmed Not to be Zhou Songqing's Handwriting; Huang Xianyao Confesses the Truth; Written by Wu Jiajin, Clerk of Lawyer Mi Jingshen</h3>
<p>After Huang Chujiu, founder of the Gongfa Company, died on January 19th of the tenth year of the Republic, the Riyue Bank, Dashijie, and Youlan Beichubu, all under the Gongfa Company, simultaneously went bankrupt. Creditors filed lawsuits, and Huang's family declared bankruptcy, handing over all private property to repay debts and requesting the court to grant the family a living allowance of 40,000 yuan. Eventually, over 20% of the debt was repaid, and the funds were managed by the First Special Court. After four years, the debt remains unsettled due to complicated matters. In the spring of this year, Wang Shaozeng, a creditor of Gongfa Company, discovered that Huang Chujiu had</p>
<p>Concealed a Large Inheritance</p>
<p>after his death, deposited at the residence of Zhou Songqing, Huang Chuli's father-in-law, at 52 Qiaojiabang, Huajie. Zhou issued a receipt stating, "After the matter is settled, the 100,000 yuan allocated to Xianyao's (Huang Xianyao's) household will be returned to their management." The receipt was signed "Songqing" and contained a handwritten fingerprint. The receipt was stored in a safe deposit box at Guohua Bank and Huang Xianyao based on this receipt, petitioned the Shanghai District Court for mediation in September of the twenty-second year, requesting Zhou Songqing to return the property. Because</p>
<p>Mediation Failed</p>
<p>and Huang had not formally filed a lawsuit, Wang Shaozeng, believing that Zhou Songqing and Huang Xianyao, father and son-in-law, were engaging in actions to damage the interests of creditors, hired lawyer Xu Yannian to file a criminal self-lawsuit in the Second Special Court against Huang Xianyao and Zhou Songqing for damaging creditor rights. After the court repeatedly summoned them, only Zhou Songqing appeared and denied issuing the receipt, while Huang Xianyao consistently failed to appear. The court issued an arrest warrant, and police officers arrested Huang on June 14th. During the hearing the next day, Huang stated that he found the receipt</p>
<p>Inside His Wife's Wardrobe</p>
<p>between March and April of the twenty-first year. He had petitioned the District Court for mediation, but it failed, and his father-in-law denied the matter. After investigation, it was confirmed that no such property existed. Zhou Songqing requested to retrieve the receipt and authenticate its veracity. On June 21st, the court summoned both parties to open the safe deposit box at Guohua Bank and retrieve the receipt. It matched the photograph submitted by the plaintiff, Wang Shaozeng. Zhou Songqing still denied everything, claiming Huang Xianyao had forged it. He reported it to the police, requesting an investigation. When the Second Special Court continued the hearing on the case of damaging creditor rights on June 26th, several creditors of Gongfa Company joined the lawsuit. Huang Xianyao stated to the court that when he was detained and awaiting bail, someone had</p>
<p>Forced and Enticed</p>
<p>him to write a receipt. During the police investigation, he was ordered to write characters, fearing further complications, he requested the court's attention. Judge Shu Chang believed that the evidence needed to be investigated, he postponed the hearing and ordered Zhou and Huang to each post 30,000 yuan in bail. Zhou was released, but Huang, unable to pay bail, was detained in the Second Special Court's detention center.</p>
<p>During this period, the police compared Zhou and Huang's writing on the receipt to the characters on the discovered 100,000 yuan receipt. Rao Boze, deputy chief of police, a calligraphy expert, magnified and photographed samples of the writing and then</p>
<p>Scientifically</p>
<p>analyzed and identified it, concluding that the receipt was not written by Zhou Songqing. Huang Xianyao confessed to the police that the receipt was written by Wu Jiajin, a clerk at lawyer Mi Jingshen's office. Yesterday, Huang Xianyao, Mi Jingshen, and Wu Jiajin were sent to the Second Special Court. Judge Li Changnian of the First Criminal Division conducted the hearing. (The second defendant, Mi Jingshen, had left the bar, though his residence was at 12 Dada Lane, Avenue Haig. The third defendant, Wu Jiajin, was living at 2 Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. Neither could be located.) Huang, 31 years old, from Yuyao, was charged according to Article 210 of the Criminal Law, as was explained by police lawyer Fei Xizhen, who presented a large volume of</p>
<p>Enlarged Handwriting Photographs.</p>
<p>The judge questioned Huang, who confessed that the receipt was written by Wu Jiajin from lawyer Mi Jingshen's office. "I was not instructed to do it; I was deceived. The matter arose because I wanted to request my wife to cohabitate with me. Lawyer Mi said that cohabitation was pointless; it would be better to get some money from my father-in-law. He offered to help me find a way and had Wu write this receipt to request mediation. Later, because mediation failed, I no longer wanted it. Then a Mr. Tang (Zengshou) used this receipt to blackmail me. When that failed, he put the receipt in the safe deposit box, causing the creditors to report me." At this point, the court postponed the hearing to August 7th at 8:00 AM because the plaintiff, Zhou Songqing, was not present. The defendants were ordered to be summoned again for questioning. The defendant was remanded to detention.</p>
<h3>Northern District National Goods Fair Opened Yesterday; Party Representatives Raised Flag and Opened Fair; Temporary Market Fully Open Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Northern District National Goods Fair, sponsored by the Shanghai Chinese National Goods Association, held its opening ceremony yesterday at 4:00 PM at the association's grounds at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Zhajiang Road in Zhabei. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Those present yesterday included Party Representative Zhu Yangwu, Fan Zhongzhang from Guangdong Brothers Rubber Company, Fan Guanghan from Yaxin Fragrance Company, Xu Zihou from Sancai Factory, and over 300 guests from various sectors. After Chairman Sun Yu conducted the ceremony, the chairman gave a report on the purpose of the fair, stating that the association, recognizing that Zhabei had not recovered from the scars of the January 28th Incident and that imports of foreign goods were increasing daily, causing alarming financial losses, organized the Northern District National Goods Fair to encourage citizens to use domestic goods. He was pleased that guests had braved the heat to participate in today's opening. The national goods movement has been promoted for many years, but with limited success. In this time of national crisis, he hoped that patriotic compatriots would use and promote domestic goods to develop the national goods industry and achieve the goals of saving the country and saving ourselves. Chairman Sun Yu then delivered a response (omitted).</p>
<p>Representative Speeches</p>
<p>Party Representative Zhu Yangwu then gave a speech, stating that the significance of the National Goods Fair was to concentrate the products of manufacturers on one hand and to make the people of northern Shanghai aware of domestic goods and to promote them on the other, to lay the foundation for saving the country. In recent years, imports of foreign goods have increased daily, with financial outflows amounting to hundreds of millions, weakening the nation's foundations and leaving it with little room to stand in the future, which is truly painful. Now, if we want to stop these financial losses and save ourselves from danger, we must use domestic goods. He hoped that everyone would promote and correct this, and that manufacturers would improve their products and dedicate themselves to domestic goods and strive for the country.</p>
<p>Market Opens</p>
<p>After the speeches, the military band led Mr. Zhu to the gate, where the national flag was raised and the curtain outside the gate was drawn back. The crowd cheered and rushed in. The association's temporary market immediately opened for business. To entertain the guests, the association hired a full troupe of Gujin performers to perform various acts. Yesterday's attendance was exceptionally high.</p>
<h3>Robbers Rent Car to Commit Robbery; He Shideng Restaurant Robbed; Robbers Drive Away in Car After Robbery</h3>
<p>At 9:50 PM last night, the Jiangsu Automobile Company at 125 Guizhou Road received a call to rent a car. The caller, claiming to be a Mr. Li from Room 412 of the Great Shanghai Hotel on Xiangfen Lane, requested the immediate dispatch of a car, saying he was waiting at the entrance of the Great Shanghai. The company's accountant immediately ordered driver Zhu Alin to take taxi No. 17691 (International Settlement) / 4181 (Chinese Territory). Upon arrival, three well-dressed men, all around 30 years old, were waiting at the entrance. Upon seeing the car, they immediately got in and told the driver to drive east along Nanjing Road towards the Bund. When the car reached the back of Wills and Sons, one of them ordered the car to stop. Two men remained in the car while one got out and told the driver to park on Renji Road. The one who had left went into the He Shideng Western Restaurant at 20 Nanjing Road for about 15 minutes. Then, the first man returned with three others, hurrying out. Reaching the car, one of them pulled out a gun and forced the driver out of the car. The driver had no choice but to comply. One of the men then started the engine and drove away. The driver, realizing he had encountered robbers, immediately reported to the company by phone. The accountant immediately reported to the Laozao Police Station. However, since the incident occurred in the jurisdiction of the Central Police Station, the driver was instructed to personally report to the Central Police Station. At this time, the He Shideng Restaurant also came to report that three or four robbers had broken into the restaurant and displayed guns. Three diners were present and were robbed of over 300 yuan in silver dollars. The police chief, upon receiving the report, immediately telegraphed the relevant police stations, the French Concession police, and the Public Security Sub-Bureau to be on the lookout for the car. However, as of press time, the car had not been recovered.</p>
<h3>Xu Xiaochu Talks About Reasons for Establishing Narcotics Management Office: Department of Health Adopted Request from Leye Association</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News reports that Mr. Xu Xiaochu, a standing committee member of the Xin Leye Trade Association, commented on the process of the Central Department of Health establishing a narcotics management office in Shanghai as follows: Since Chairman Chiang issued a strict ban on potent narcotics last year, merchants needing to purchase narcotics for formulation purposes have complied with the Central Management of Pharmaceutical Merchants Regulations and Chairman Chiang's directives without error. Foreign merchants, however, are not subject to these restrictions and can import freely with consular certification. Therefore, when representatives of the Xin Yaoye Trade Association and the Pharmaceutical Factory Trade Association went to Beijing twice to petition for the Management of Prepared Medicines Regulations, they repeatedly requested that Director Liu of the Department of Health establish a special office to regulate and manage narcotics. Director Liu adopted this request, so the establishment of the management office was in response to this request. Reports stating that pharmacies are prohibited from selling narcotics are a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Ye Bocang Evaluates Fortunes to Aid Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Ye Bocang, a native of Wu, has lived in Shanghai for many years. In his spare time, he enjoys studying fortune-telling and provides evaluations and guidance to those who are lost. His words are often accurate, and friends and relatives who have consulted him are amazed at his abilities. However, he usually does not accept fees, except for close friends and relatives. But during times of disaster, he uses his knowledge to help the public and donates his earnings to disaster relief. In the past, during the disasters of 1925 and 1931, Mr. Ye's fortune-telling and disaster relief efforts were very successful. This summer, the heavy rains in Hubei, Shandong, Hunan, and Jiangxi Provinces have caused flooding and unprecedented disasters. Mr. Ye, feeling compassion, is again publicly evaluating fortunes to aid in charitable efforts, despite the heat. Those who seek evaluation will not only learn about their fortune and avoid misfortune but also benefit disaster victims. This is a win-win situation and a great merit. The fee for a brief evaluation is 5 yuan, and for a detailed evaluation, it is 10 yuan. Disaster relief donations can be sent to Xintong Bank, 579 Henan Road, and will be delivered within a week without delay. If you donate to the flood relief and note that it is for "Bocang's Fortune-Telling Disaster Relief," it can also be exchanged.</p>
<h3>Chen Changheng to Lecture on China's Population Problem</h3>
<p>The twelfth lecture in the Shanghai YMCA's "Chinese Economy" series, "China's Population Problem," was originally scheduled to be given by Legislative Yuan member Chen Changheng on the 10th of next month. However, Mr. Chen will be lecturing in Guangxi at that time and will not be able to come to Shanghai. Therefore, the lecture has been moved to this month on the 31st (Wednesday) at 7:30 PM. Mr. Chen is our country's only expert on population problems and has written many books. He will surely present a profound discussion. Those interested in China's population problems are welcome to attend.</p>

<h3>Dielai Hotel Sending Out Discount Coupons</h3>

<h3>Hu Hanzhu Takes Over the Far East Theatre, Hires Many Famous Performers, Opening Tonight</h3>
<p>The dramatist Hu Hanzhu has considerable research into the dramas of various regions. Considering that the lyrics and plots of Shaoxing opera troupes are somewhat lacking in refinement, he intends to improve them. Therefore, he has contracted to take over the Far East Theatre, which specializes in Shaoxing opera, naming it the Yuetuo Theatre Company as an initial experimental base. In addition to retaining all the performers from the Hengrui Stage as the core cast, he has also hired Liang Younong, Lin Yulin, Li Yushui, Chen Hegao, Xiao Yangsong, Zhang Cuixia, and other famous performers to enhance the effect. The opening performance is scheduled for tonight. It is expected that Zhejiang natives in Shanghai will be eager to see it.</p>
<h3>Dunhe Lane Rent Reduction Meeting</h3>
<p>Dunhe Lane on Route Ratard in the French Concession was built around October of the 20th year of the Republic (1931). The location is in the west and not a prosperous commercial area. Commerce has always been sluggish here, especially since the January 28th Shanghai Incident. Shops have become even more desolate, with few customers. Coupled with high rents that are unbearable, tenants have united to form the Dunhe Lane branch of the 8th District Subcommittee of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation. Yesterday at 4 p.m., the second preparatory meeting was held at the 8th District Subcommittee's office. Despite the scorching sun and hot weather, the tenants did not hesitate to attend on time, totaling 27 households. Zhang Zhiqin of Nanchang Company was elected as chairman, and Zhu Yunsheng as secretary. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, the discussion of the rent reduction plan began. (1) At the previous meeting, it was resolved to send a letter to the managing agent, Talley &amp; Co., requesting a 30% rent reduction. The Document Section has already prepared and sent the letter, but after ten days, no response has been received. How should this be handled? After the tenants present expressed their opinions, the chairman summarized the consensus and put it to a vote. It was resolved that if the landlord does not grant a rent reduction, the rent due will be deposited in a designated bank under the name "Talley &amp; Co. Managing Agents," to demonstrate determination until the goal is achieved. Everyone applauded and unanimously approved. (2) To prevent the landlord from suing for rent arrears, it was resolved to hire Wang Peiyuan as legal counsel to legally protect rights and interests. (3) To appoint responsible personnel to prevent the landlord's henchmen, it was resolved to appoint Zhang Zhiqin of Nanchang Company and Zeng Jinchun of Heji as northern supervisors of all tenants, Yongfayuan and Yongqing as central supervisors of all tenants, and Zhang Jiyun and Dayuan as southern supervisors of all tenants. (4) To report to superiors for record-keeping, it was resolved that the Document Section would be responsible. (5) For the next meeting, it was resolved to hold the inaugural meeting at 3 p.m. on August 3rd and to invite party and government agencies to attend and provide guidance. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: National Goods City Expansion Delayed Opening</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang National Goods City Commercial Center was previously negotiated by Li Linfu, the General Affairs Director of the China National Goods Production and Sales Promotion Association, who selected the New Garden in Zhenjiang Provincial Government Road as the site. It is now heard that the association found the site insufficient due to enthusiastic registration by various manufacturers. Therefore, it reassigned design committee member Bao Linjun to Zhenjiang to locate vacant land near the Jianghai Customs to build the commercial center for application. It is reported that the design drawings have been completed and construction will begin soon, expected to be completed before August 20th. Therefore, the association has decided to hold the opening of the Zhenjiang National Goods City Commercial Center on August 20th.</p>

<h3>New Filament Electric Bulb Introduced</h3>
<p>The world-renowned electric lamp giants General Electric, Edison, Osram, and Philips have now created a new type of ordinary light bulb with higher efficiency, called the "Woven Filament Bulb." With a wattage of 40 watts, it emits 10% more light than ordinary bulbs while using the same amount of electricity. In other words, users can obtain more light for the same electricity bill. This is a major advance in electrical science. This type of light bulb can reduce the cost of lighting. In ordinary argon bulbs, the filament is surrounded by nitrogen or argon, making it less likely to melt than vacuum bulbs. The filament of the woven filament bulb is even more heat-resistant. Its filament is shorter and thicker. Because the filament is larger, it also emits more light. Although this type of light bulb seems very simple, it is the result of several years of dedicated research before it could be widely applied. It is reported that this type of light bulb is now sold by the Zhonghe Bulb Company in this city, which is the manager of the famous General Electric, Edison, Osram, and Philips legacy light bulbs.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated: Shandong and surrounding areas are cloudy, with winds varying from northeast to southeast.

The lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastline of this area are cloudy with showers and strong southeast winds. The East China Sea and surrounding areas of Taiwan have a very intense cyclone, with very bad weather, showers, and storms, due to a hurricane approaching Taiwan from the north-northwest. The hurricane center at noon reached within approximately 60 miles of 23 degrees 30 minutes north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude, with strong winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the local temperature was a maximum of 94.1 and a minimum of 78.3. On the same day last year, the maximum was 100.2 and the minimum was 77.4.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Yu Mugu)</p>
<p>"Everyone knows how to perform magic, but each has their own unique skill." In this world we live in, everything, every moment, is a performance of magic. Because each has its own unique skill, it forms various levels of life styles of wealth, poverty, joy, and sorrow.</p>
<p>Dolls are what children like to play with. In fact, people all like to play with children, so children are people's dolls. And capitalists like to play with people, so people are the capitalists' dolls. Money likes to play with capitalists, and capitalists often become the dolls of money. In short, all people in the world are dolls played by money.</p>
<p>"People's hearts are different, each like their face. But people's faces can be seen clearly with the naked eye. People's hearts cannot be窥探 by the naked eye. One's own face can also be seen in a mirror at a glance, but one's own heart cannot be seen in a mirror. People ignore this principle. If they don't even know what their own heart is like, how can they specialize in blaming people's hearts for being unpredictable?"</p>
<p>The scenes of a movie are projected until the end, causing the audience to have unlimited thoughts and criticisms. Our lives are also like performing a movie, scene after scene passes until the final death, arousing the thoughts and criticisms of many people. Therefore, before we are alive, we must first think about after death, and plan for the thoughts and criticisms of many people.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Yun Tieqiao</h3>
<p>— Tian Sheweng</p>
<p>Tian Sheweng said: Writing changes with the times. Du Gu Changzhou, following the decadent elegance of the Six Dynasties, emerged with peace and gentleness. Ouyang, after the turmoil of the Five Dynasties, also emerged with peace; both were enough to save the declining customs. In the late Qing Guangxu years, a few patriots had the ambition to change customs through fiction. Gentlemen such as Wu Yanren, Li Boyuan, Wang Yuansheng, Lin Qinnan, Jiang Jingjian, Chen Lengxue, Bao Tianxiao, and Xu Fumin all used fiction to influence the times. After the cessation of Xiaoshuo Lin, Yuet Yuet Xiaoshuo, and Shangwu Illustrated Fiction, Di Pingzi founded the Xiaoshuo Shibao, and Wang Xishen created the Xiaoshuo Yuebao. This was during the Guangxu and Xuantong periods.</p>
<p>At that time, the Xiaoshuo Shibao published three lengthy novels by the American novelist Charles Garvice, "Nutmeg Flower", "Black-Clad Lady", and "Ripple on the Yinyin", which were charming and sensual and could move my heart. The translator was Mr. Yun Tieqiao of Wujin. After the Qing dynasty was overthrown, Shuo Bao arose, piled up in confusion, and were called the Mandarin Duck Butterfly School, which was criticized by connoisseurs. At that time, Mr. Yun took charge of the selection of the Xiaoshuo Yuebao, corrected the malpractice of piling up, and wrote and translated fiction that was clear and utterly different from the slender and beautiful works such as "Nutmeg Flower" and "Black-Clad Lady." Did he also see that if the lowly pot roars like thunder, and customs are changed, nothing but this could lead to it? At that time, some criticized Mr. Yun's novels as "big sayings." In my opinion, Mr. Yun was truly the Martin Luther of the fiction world at that time.</p>
<p>Mr. Yun, whose given name was Shujue, courtesy name Tieqiao, also known as Lengfeng, Jiaomu, was a native of Wujin, Jiangsu, and a descendant of the Qing painter Nantian Laoren. In the Qing Dynasty, he graduated from Nanyang Public School, so he had a good foundation in Western languages. His translated novels used a clear and beautiful style to express lingering feelings. Readers admired and praised works such as "Nutmeg Flower", "Black-Clad Lady", and "Spring Water from the Mountains". Mr. Yun deeply regretted not knowing medicine because his children were often sick, so he widely studied classical medical texts; after a long time, he gained considerable insights. He was the first to use scientific methods to organize classical medical texts.</p>
<p>Mr. Yun's medical knowledge was profound, and his insights were very rich. After he began practicing medicine, patients who sought his diagnosis recovered quickly, so his threshold was worn through. Mr. Yun immersed himself in medicine, diligently and tirelessly. In his spare time, he entertained himself with writing. To this day, his medical writings form a huge collection; commentators regard him as a medical expert, but they did not know that Mr. Yun was originally a novelist.</p>
<p>Mr. Yun had been ill for a long time. Recently, his illness worsened due to the unbearable heat, and he suddenly passed away the day before yesterday at the age of fifty-eight. After the death of Mr. Zeng Mengpu (East Asian Sick Man) last month, the news of Mr. Yun's death has been heard again. Another novelist has weakened, is it not just the misfortune of the national medical community!</p>
<h3>Unconscious Scene</h3>
<p>— Qingquan</p>
<h3>Small Decorations</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shou Ruo)</p>
<p>It is said that modern small families should have various necessary small decorations: this is in line with the organizational principles of small families. Now, let's briefly list them below for reference. If there are any shortcomings, please feel free to discuss and modify them, in order to achieve perfection and practical application.</p>
<p>Detailed list:</p>
<p>One black lacquered bench, one vase; countless weapons; (or prepare a debt platform); eight or nine curved beauties of varying lengths; one or two crystals of love; one copy of "Divorce Must Read"; one copy of "Cosmetic Surgery"; one copy of "Understanding Singing and Dancing During the Day"; two volumes of "Modern Dictionary" (preferably with a supplementary volume).</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Do Not Ask About the Hidden Pain of a Daughter's Body; Strive to See the Face of a Noble Person and Adore Their High Moral Character</p>
<p>Li Shilian said, "Seeking Buddha and seeking honor, why bother going around in circles? Now that Mr. Zhang has become wealthy, if you let him help you with a small favor, that would be enough." Yang Wanhua laughed, "I have ears, and I have long heard that a central official is coming and is related to him." She turned her eyes to look at Jiefu's face. Jiefu raised his eyebrows and said, "If you want me to think of a little way to help you, it may not be difficult after tomorrow." Wanhua said, "Why does it have to be after tomorrow? Is tomorrow a day to make a big fortune?" Jiefu said, "Didn't you hear that Commissioner Lan is arriving tomorrow? He is my relative. When he comes, he will inevitably have many things for me to do. Naturally, if I am asked to do things, of course, there will be money passing through my hands. At that time, I can move a little small amount for you from the large sums of money. That's not worth mentioning." Wanhua said, "Don't you know that I have to leave early tomorrow morning? If I wait for you to give me the money tomorrow, I won't be able to catch the car to Tongguan, and I will have to spend several more dollars to buy a ticket, which is still not cost-effective." Jiefu smiled faintly, "I am just in the position of a friend, helping a little. How can everything in the world be done perfectly? Then you will have to choose for yourself." Hearing his tone, Wanhua could not get any practical indication, and it seemed that there was not much hope of getting money from him, so she stood there in a daze. Zhang Jiefu seemed to be very busy and did not have time to chat, turned his body, and walked to his own room. Li Shilian closely followed behind and also left. Only Yang Wanhua was left under the corridor. She was able to get a train ticket because of Zhang Jiefu's kind words. Otherwise, Jia Duocai had already gotten Zhu Yueying, and he would cross the river and tear down the bridge, and she would have no way. (277)</p>
<h3>Imperial Incense Wanders Around Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Yellow River, as everyone knows, is a very unsafe river, and every year it has to cause several major floods; this year, as usual, it has broken out again, and the people along the coast are naturally suffering from famine and epidemics. The number of people drowned is always more than two or three thousand, and there are five or six thousand people who have become homeless. Originally, the court had some preparations for this kind of disaster that had to occur every year, but this year's disaster was particularly serious, and some of the relief funds and food originally prepared were not enough to distribute, which caused the officials handling the relief to be at a loss. There was no way but to report the truth. According to the court's old rules, whatever happens will inevitably be delayed a lot. First, it must be sent to the Military Aircraft Department for reading, and then transferred by the Military Aircraft Department to the relevant yamen for review. After review for a long time, a memorial will be drafted and the imperial decree will be requested; this way, it often takes a month or two to deliver. That day, after the Empress Dowager received the report that the disaster was serious and the relief funds were insufficient, she reversed the old habits and resolutely picked up the pen and wrote a few sentences, and immediately handed it over to the Ministry of Household to urgently allocate hundreds of thousands of taels of silver from the treasury, dedicated to relieving the Huang disaster. She was still afraid that they would not understand her good intentions and would not be very willing, so she issued another special order saying:</p>
<p>"As long as it is really used for disaster relief, we should not save a penny; if there is not enough cash in the treasury and there is no way to allocate it temporarily, I am also willing to donate my private property. We must do this thing to a relatively satisfactory result!" (377)</p>

<p>Location: Court</p>
<p>Curtain opens: (Near the start of the trial, Lao Zhang is sitting under the public case. The plaintiff's lawyer walks over to report. The two are acquaintances and chat casually)</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: Lawyer Pan, good morning!</p>
<p>Lawyer: It's time, hasn't the judge arrived yet?</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: He's here, the court will open soon!</p>
<p>Lawyer: Today's case is interesting, a very beautiful woman is asking a very ugly man to admit that she is his wife.</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: I guess this man will definitely admit she is.</p>
<p>Lawyer: If he admitted her, would she still need to sue? Fool!</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: Alas! There are really such unfair things in the world! A beautiful woman is asking to be his wife, and he still won't admit it?</p>
<p>Lawyer: Lao Zhang! Why are you sighing? Haven't you got a wife even at your age?</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: To tell you the truth... my wife was really beautiful, but because I was poor, she ran away with someone six years ago!</p>
<p>Lawyer: Didn't you look for her back then?</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: Because I was looking for her, I went from Beiping to Shanghai. At that time, I was really like a madman, I couldn't tell the taste of tea and rice, and I was always thinking about her!</p>
<p>Lawyer: What happened later?</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: Alas! Don't mention it! Today, it has been exactly six years, and there has been no news at all!</p>
<p>Lawyer: Women change their minds so quickly, I say that woman is too heartless! (Cheng Caizhen enters, Liu Hongxiang and his lawyer enter, spectators enter one after another)</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: The judge is here (everyone stands up to salute, the atmosphere is solemn)</p>
<p>(The judge flips through the files, the bailiff leads Caizhen into the plaintiff's column, Hongxiang stands in the defendant's column, Lao Zhang is sitting directly behind Caizhen, staring at the back of her head in great surprise,)</p>
<p>Judge: Are you called Cheng Caizhen?</p>
<p>Caizhen: Yes.</p>
<p>Judge: How old are you? Where are you from?</p>
<p>Caizhen: Twenty-eight years old, from Beiping!</p>
<p>Judge: Why are you suing Liu Hongxiang?</p>
<p>Caizhen: Because he doesn't admit that I'm his wife!</p>
<p>Judge: When did you marry him?</p>
<p>Caizhen: I married him when I was twenty-two years old, Qiguang, he treated me well, but starting from the winter of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), he became increasingly indifferent to me and abandoned me until now. Now that he has made a fortune, he has lost his conscience and won't let me into his house, please save me, Judge!</p>
<p>Judge: Liu Hongxiang!</p>
<p>Hongxiang: Yes.</p>
<p>Judge: How old are you? Where are you from?</p>
<p>Hongxiang: Thirty-six years old, from Shanghai!</p>
<p>Judge: What business do you do?</p>
<p>Hongxiang: I own a silk shop.</p>
<p>Judge: Did you hear Cheng Caizhen's words just now clearly? What is your opinion?</p>
<p>Hongxiang: I don't admit that she is my wife, because she has never married me! But we had a relationship five years ago. At that time, I was just a shop assistant in a silk shop. She嫌ed I was poor and fell in love with someone else and left. Now that she sees my situation is better, she has come to pester me again, I will never admit it!</p>
<p>(At this moment, all of Lao Zhang's painful past events flood into his mind)</p>
<p>Plaintiff's lawyer: Now the facts have proven that the plaintiff and the defendant have a marital relationship, please the judge to confirm the plaintiff as the defendant's wife!</p>
<p>Defendant's lawyer: According to Article 208 of the Civil Procedure Law, please the judge reject the plaintiff's suit!</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: (emotionally agitated) What a vile woman! (Cheng Caizhen suddenly sees Lao Zhang and is panic-stricken)</p>
<p>Bailiff: Lao Zhang! Are you dizzy? Where is this place?</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: (like a madman) Lawyer Pan! She is my wife! (grabs Caizhen) Come back with me!</p>
<p>Caizhen: Who is your wife?</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: What a heartless woman, I almost died because of you!……</p>
<p>Judge: (enraged) This person is crazy, throw him out!</p>
<p>Caizhen: Judge! I don't know him!</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: (being held by two bailiffs) What a shameless woman! Using business tactics to marry a husband, if the rich are not your customers, you force them! If the poor are clearly your customers, you push them out! I can't eat your meat, but I must peel your skin...</p>
<p>Bailiff: Stop babbling! Get out! Get out! Get out!</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: What if I don't go out?</p>
<p>Bailiff: (strongly pushes Lao Zhang) Scram! Scram! Scram!</p>
<p>Lao Zhang: I just won't go out! I just won't go out!</p>

<h3>Introducing "Little Men"</h3>
<p>— Gan</p>
<p>A New Contribution to the Opening of Children's Year in This Newspaper</p>
<p>To be Published in This Column Starting August 1st</p>
<p>The Famous Work of Ms. Louisa May Alcott of the United States</p>
<p>Translated by Zheng Xiaocang, Director of the Department of Education at Zhejiang University</p>
<p>There are three prerequisites for implementing children's education: first, excellent teachers; second, perfect teaching materials; and third, a loving society. Only when all three are in place can the implementation of children's education be easy and effective. Among the three, the selection of children's teaching materials is the most important, because it has a great impact on the development of children's intelligence.</p>
<p>Our newspaper has always taken the promotion of children's education as its mission. In October of the year before last, we launched "Children's Weekly." In this year's Children's Day, we published "Children's Friend." All publications aim to make a small contribution in terms of children's teaching materials. Now, on the occasion of the opening of Children's Year, we have specially commissioned Mr. Zheng Xiaocang to translate the book "Little Men." The author of this book, Ms. Louisa May Alcott, is the daughter of the American philosopher Bronson Alcott. She devoted her life to education and writing, enduring many hardships but never changing her ambition. After the publication of "Little Women" and "Good Wives," her reputation soared. The extent of their circulation was unprecedented in the publishing industry. The term "Little Women" is almost a household name in England and the United States. Two years later, she completed the book "Little Men." On the day of its publication, the author had just returned to the United States from Europe. Friends greeted her in a carriage with a red banner inscribed with the three characters "Little Men," hanging high above the port. It is said that pre-orders for this book in the United States had reached more than 50,000 copies before its publication, which can be considered a great success.</p>
<p>This book describes more than a dozen boys and girls with different temperaments, who live a free and unrestrained life under proper supervision, so that their bodies become healthier and their knowledge gradually improves. All their actions are full of educational meaning, with guidance embedded in suggestion. It is truly a good book for teachers, parents, and children. As for the vividness of its writing, anyone who has read "Little Women" and "Good Wives" can predict it. Moreover, the translator, Mr. Zheng, is known to the country for his learning and experience in education and literature. His translations of Alcott's books are fluent and accessible, and have been widely praised. Now he has translated this famous work, which will surely be even more successful. Then we are even more willing to use the name of the translator to add a layer of guarantee to this book.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market was up. Although foreign banks reversed their earlier gains and declined, investor sentiment remained bullish.

<h3>Public Bond Delivery: Silver and Banking Sectors Particularly Busy with Settlements</h3>
<p>The interbank call loan rate in the market yesterday remained unchanged, at 0.2 for both morning and afternoon sessions. The head-of-the-line price remained the same, with no additional water added. The overall sentiment appeared slightly better than before. However, with the end of the month approaching, settlements were busy and complex, so the settlement situation gradually became more active.

In addition, there were over 500,000 in marked securities, 200,000 in customer-sourced funds, and 300,000 in outflows. As for the banking sector, the current settlement situation was difficult due to commercial circulation, so the number of routine settlements was also scarce. As yesterday was Monday and also the end of the month, settlements were busy, so they seemed more numerous than usual.

<h3>Cotton Yarn  Rumors of Speculation Boost Prices  Cotton Yarn Soars to Astonishing Heights Again  Forward Yarn, Near-Month Cotton Approach 80 Yuan, 36 Yuan Thresholds</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the price surge is gaining momentum. This situation is entirely due to the increasing number of yarn factories facing economic difficulties and closures, leading to a sharp reduction in production. Merchants are prioritizing the removal of yarn from warehouses, causing heightened anxiety. Recently, the market has been rife with rumors, and concerns about currency issues are exceptionally strong. Furthermore, there is talk of a bullish consortium being formed this month. Bears have experienced extreme panic, causing the market to surge by five yuan, with forward months nearing the 180-yuan mark.</p>
<p>A Leap of Five Yuan for Chicken</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard yarn saw moderate price increases across all months. However, there weren't many new sellers in the market. Later, upon hearing that benchmark prices were trending higher, the situation suddenly tightened, and a certain party continued to purchase in large quantities. Regarding the rumored formation of a bullish consortium for this month, at the close of the auction, a certain factory owner was buying in large quantities in forward months without price limits, causing the market to suddenly tighten and sellers to become scarce. As a result, each month's closing price increased by 1.56 to 2.89 yuan compared to the previous day's close. Upon the afternoon opening, discussions in the market were diverse, but all favored the bulls. Buyers and sellers of this month's yarn remained locked in a stalemate, with frantic bids reaching 180 yuan. Later, due to the high price, some selling occurred, leading to a slight pullback. However, Geng Feng head traders frantically purchased 850 bales, driving the forward months steadily upward, step by step, creating a tight situation. As a result, each month's price increased by another 2.3 to 3.68 yuan compared to the morning close. Sales included 1,000 bales of Yu Kang, 550 bales of Yi Da, 750 bales of Sui Long, 450 bales of Da Ji, 2,000 bales of Xin Chang, 6,450 bales of Ming De, 2,150 bales of He Xing, 1,350 bales of Rui Da, 1,250 bales of Jun Chang, 700 bales of Sen Kang, 1,200 bales of Shen Ji, 2,750 bales of Run Kang, 1,300 bales of Tai Chang, and 1,550 bales of Chang Feng. Purchases included 1,650 bales of Ming Hua, 2,800 bales of Da Fu, 4,850 bales of Tong Ji, 900 bales of Zhen Da, 4,900 bales of Geng Feng, 900 bales of Da Chang Cheng, 1,250 bales of Tai Chang, 800 bales of Chang Feng, 4,100 bales of Heng Chang, 1,600 bales of Shen Chang, and 850 bales of Sheng Yuan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Rises by 2-3 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. Statistics show that merchants purchased a total of 812 bales throughout the day, with prices rising by 2-3 yuan. The total volume of Japanese yarn transacted was 400 bales. The purchase volume of each merchant is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland: 955</p>
<p>Yunnan: 200</p>
<p>Ningbo: 2</p>
<p>Luzhou: 20</p>
<p>Sichuan: 110</p>
<p>Anqing: 25</p>
<p>Changsha: 200</p>
<p>Guangdong: 135</p>
<p>The cotton market is rising along with the yarn market, and the upward trend is becoming increasingly sharp. This situation is unprecedented. Rumors are spreading in the market, causing people to be even more bullish. The market is bustling, and sellers are scarce. The benchmark price reached a high of 894 yuan. The talk of currency inflation is becoming increasingly intense, and new cotton has soared by 1.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Surges by 1.3 Yuan</p>
<p>The pre-market opening for standard cotton saw some upward momentum, but it wasn't strong. Upon reaching the second and third trading sessions, the opening prices rose, and the market was filled with rumors of severe currency inflation. Buying activity was strong, and the upward pressure on forward months intensified at the close of the market. As a result, the prices for each month increased by 0.65 to 0.89 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Upon the afternoon opening, due to the surge in the yarn market, the upward trend intensified further. Speculators were eager to cover their positions, and market prices steadily rose. The benchmark price broke through the 90-yuan mark. As a result, the prices for each month increased by 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 5,600 dan of Chang Feng, 1,700 dan of Tong Xing, 1,700 dan of Chang Ji, 1,700 dan of Da Fu, 3,700 dan of Tong Fu, 4,300 dan of Tong Ji, 2,400 dan of Da Feng, 2,000 dan of Yuan Da, 3,700 dan of Ming De, 4,000 dan of Rui Da, 2,300 dan of Da Chang, 2,800 dan of Yong Da, 2,800 dan of Yi Feng, 2,700 dan of Yong Chang, and 3,800 dan of Chang He. Purchases included 3,200 dan of Sheng Yuan, 4,700 dan of Run Kang, 1,700 dan of Yu Da, 1,900 dan of Da Fu, 1,800 dan of Geng Feng, 3,700 dan of Da Chang Cheng, 4,300 dan of Chang Feng, 2,700 dan of Heng Chang, 5,000 dan of Chang He, 3,800 dan of Sui Long, 2,200 dan of Da Ji, 3,000 dan of Jun Chang, and 2,900 dan of Yuan Xing Chang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Daily Demand for Cotton is Strong</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are good. Demand from outside factories is relatively strong. The sources are estimated to be 155 bales of Yao cotton and 453 bales of Tong cotton, it is said. The number of deliveries was 43.39 million. Various speculative funds concentrated in the public bond market, market prices turned sharply upward from record lows.</p>
<h3>Securities  Overview of July Public Bond Deliveries  Delivery Volume of 43.39 Million  Various Speculative Funds Concentrate in the Public Bond Market  Market Prices Turn Sharply Upward from Record Lows</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 29th, was the delivery date for July futures public bonds on the Chinese Securities Exchange. Although it was after the Hebei Incident and under pressure from various circumstances, with difficult internal and external affairs and numerous hurdles, those preparing to receive goods were still very enthusiastic. The delivery volume for July still reached 43.39 million. Among this, after various brokers offset long and short positions and settled independently, 19.66 million were settled. Those settled on the exchange amounted to 14.13 million. The number of off-exchange settlements was even higher than this. Therefore, on the surface, it seemed as though people were selling off due to the worsening environment. However, since the North China Incident, the unsoundness of the financial circles in Tianjin and Shanghai, coupled with the massive floods, has been increasingly alarming. Bears took advantage of this to resist stubbornly, but as a result, various merchants became increasingly unsure of where to invest. With industry in decline and the silver and money business difficult to develop, various speculative funds gradually concentrated in the public bond market. On July 11, there were disturbances in Tianjin, and rumors of a reduction in bond interest rates spread in the market, causing extreme panic. At the time, salt tax bonds fell by 7.4 yuan, troop disbandment bonds fell by 7.75 yuan, and gold short bonds fell by 9.1 yuan. Later, after the rumors subsided and the Hebei Incident was resolved, the market initially rebounded due to the bears covering their positions, followed by purchases by retail investors and large investors switching from short to long positions, causing prices to rise. Finally, as the July futures period was nearing its end, there were sudden rumors of gold and pound loans, and even talk of banks reducing the cash portion of their paper money reserves from 60% to 40%, intensifying concerns about currency inflation, causing prices to surge sharply, coming within only 3 yuan or so of the high prices on May 30. However, currently, people's confidence remains strong, and it is not easy to see a sudden small decline. The 96 public bond has been able to stand independently and rise firmly amidst the tumultuous waves in various bond markets, entirely due to the support of a certain group. Its future is not entirely unfavorable. The July futures delivery accounts and total trading volumes are listed separately below (unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Food  Wheat Flour Retracts Immediately After Rising</h3>
<p>The flour market initially rose and then fell, showing a rather chaotic situation. With the quoted prices for foreign wheat rising significantly, Chicago rose by a large 1.0 yuan, Canada rose by 0.6 yuan, and Liverpool rose by 2 pence, the sentiment for all months rose uniformly after the opening. Near months rose by about 0.2 yuan, while forward months rose by 0.1 yuan. Initial trading was exceptionally active. However, after the second session, sentiment suddenly softened again because large factories sold off aggressively in various months. Some of the speculative longs also took advantage of the opportunity to close out their positions. As a result, market sentiment gradually softened, and trading volume reached over 700,000 bags in half a day, which was a rare sight since the market had been quiet. Despite the conflicting rumors about silver, gold prices did not loosen, so customer sentiment remained stable. As a result, this month was still up 0.075 yuan, August and September remained unchanged, October was up a small 0.05 yuan, November was down 0.015 yuan, and December was down 0.01 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>The wheat market presented an initial rise followed by a stabilization yesterday. Initially, due to rising foreign wheat prices and rising gold prices, the initial opening prices for each month rose by varying amounts of 0.01 to 0.024 yuan. From the second session onward, prices gradually softened because the flour market went from high to low, and some merchants also took the opportunity to sell their foreign wheat positions. Therefore, while prices stabilized, they inevitably suffered a slight blow. However, this situation is likely to be a temporary impulse. In the future, if there is no dumping of spot foreign wheat, those in the industry generally expect it to stand firm. As a result, August was up 0.01 yuan, September was down a small 0.01 yuan, October was unchanged, and November was down a small 0.01 yuan. The spot wheat market saw customers selling off, and the producing areas also did not loosen prices appropriately. Each merchant raised prices by another 0.03 to 0.05 yuan. The opening prices for Wuyi wheat were 0.35 yuan, then up to 0.45 yuan; Yanghe Yaowan wheat was 3.6 yuan, then up to 3.56 yuan; Hu Re wheat was 3.43 yuan; Wuhe wheat was 3.51 yuan; Gaozi Liuhe Yangzhou Zhenjiang wheat was 1.45 yuan, then up to 1.4 yuan; Jiang Xin Zhou wheat was 3.52 yuan; Danyang wheat was 3.47 yuan; and Jiangbei wheat was 3.52 yuan. As for boat wheat such as Weiting Kunshan Zhitang, the high-quality goods were 3.5 yuan, then up to 3.4 yuan. 8,000 bags went to Fu Xin, 3,000 bags went to Shen Da, and 2,000 bags went to Xin Da, it is said.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat July 26 July 27 Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>September 89.250 93.125 Up 3.875</p>
<p>December 90.750 94.125 Up 3.375</p>
<p>May 93.750 96.500 Up 2.750</p>
<p>Spot 99.125 104.125 Up 5.000</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>August 83.625 85.50 Up 1.875</p>
<h3>Du Yang Rice Sees Another Increase</h3>
<p>The supply of local rice (Shanghai South) was scarce again yesterday, with only 7-8 shipments arriving (totaling 1,500-1,600 shi). After the surge in the previous session, the market situation still had some lingering effects yesterday. However, both retail and wholesale demand were weaker than before, and the situation deteriorated by noon. Although the prices for each type of rice still rose due to the continued scarcity of supply, the overall environment was weak. If a large supply arrives later, it may be difficult to maintain the current prices. It is estimated that the wholesale demand was only 140-150 bags from the Yantai merchant, but the prices of various thick japonica and thin indica varieties all increased by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The prices at Yin Yuan were stable, and there was no difference at Dong Xin. In Shanghai North, about 7-8 ships arrived from various locations downstream yesterday, with 50-60 ships remaining downstream. The retail sales of white japonica in the market continued from the early session, leading to another increase of 0.1-0.2 yuan. By the close of the market, retail sales had slowed down slightly. Dong Xin had over 100 shi arriving, and scattered transactions continued. Market prices were stable, with early thin indica rice having good demand, with prices rising by 0.1 yuan. Retail sales of white Yuan rice were sluggish, with prices up by a small 0.01 yuan. There were no significant price changes for other varieties.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market saw speculative buying again yesterday, mainly because the total inventory in Shanghai is decreasing daily, and there are no new arrivals. Due to high costs, merchants are unwilling to sell at low prices. Once local customer demand is active, the market will immediately turn upward. Yesterday, the price of downstream rice had already rebounded, and merchants' sentiments were upward. With downstream rice prices rising, the main street is paying more attention to foreign rice. Although inland demand is not strong, merchants in Jiujiang, Hankou, and Beiyang are all preparing to purchase. The main street has the most demand, and the prices of various foreign rice immediately rose by 0.1 yuan. Throughout the day, 8,700 bags of Saigon rice, 1,500 bags of Xiaojiao rice, and 1,400 bags of Siam rice and Mindang rice were sold, totaling 11,600 bags. The outlook is also optimistic.</p>
<h3>Gancheng Gate Soybeans Have Also Entered the Market - Opening Price at 3.9 Yuan -</h3>
<p>The second batch of new soybeans from Jiujiang to enter the market is the Chengmendou soybean, but the amount is very small, only 15 bags. The product is good, but the quality is softer compared to the Jiangqiaodou soybean. The opening price is 2.9 yuan, distributed to the small grinding and vegetable stall owners in this street. Whether the later batches can follow this will take a while. The old soybean market atmosphere is still plain and tired, because the go-way is not smooth, and at the time of the new goods debut, the market situation can not help but soft weak, soybean cake trading is still continued, the price market is mutually exclusive.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods  Xiang Lotus Continues to Rise, Fungus Declines  Peanut Crop Failure Leads to Rising Opening Prices</h3>
<p>Xiang Lotus: Recently, land prices have been tightening, approaching 40 yuan, and the harvest has been severely damaged due to flooding. Therefore, sentiment in Shanghai is excellent, and prices are steadily rising. There is talk of top-grade Zhuang Xiangtan lotus selling for over 50 yuan, while ordinary ones require 45 yuan.</p>
<p>Fungus: The shortage in Hankou saw rising prices, but this was difficult to sustain. According to a recent letter, 200-300 bales of goods in transit will arrive soon, so the negotiated price has already fallen by 2 yuan. Further declines are expected.</p>
<p>Raw Peanuts: Due to the poor harvest recently and rising prices in Qingdao, coupled with the low prices in Shanghai, once the market moves, the upward trend will definitely be strong. Yesterday, Guangdong merchants showed strong interest. The higher-grade Dangshan peanuts were offered at 6.3 yuan, but buyers were only willing to pay 6.1 yuan, and negotiations are ongoing. Ordinary suburban peanuts were trading at 6.6 yuan. The market is expected to tighten further.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market  Guangdong Sugar Regular Auctions to Proceed as Usual</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a rebound in the trend as customs gold strengthened. In the association's intraday trading, 24 raw white sugar spot was offered at 16.35 yuan and transit goods at 4.8 yuan, but no transactions were made. However, goods at our warehouse traded at 16.4 yuan, up 0.05 yuan. Our factory's fine white sugar also quoted higher due to the rising cost of raw materials, with Number 1 being offered at 15.6 yuan but no transaction was made. Domestic Chaoqing sugar's export was halted as Shantou handled registration, so a price rise is expected in the later market. Therefore, Shanghai Number 1 goods also quoted higher yesterday, with limited sporadic transactions and limited fluctuations. 70-80 bags of first grade cotton red sugar was offered at 11.4 yuan, several dozens bags of Zhiyang sugar was offered at 12.4 yuan, increasing by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Dongbai sugar called up five or six points without success.</p>
<p>Since the Sugar Industry Cooperative reduced the price of raw white sugar, it has been difficult to agree on prices, and auctions have been suspended for a long time. It is reported that the industry has been notified that starting from August 2nd, auctions will still be held regularly every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as the sugar market has seen improvement.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods  Autumn and Winter Woolens  Sichuan Merchants Order in Advance</h3>
<p>Autumn and winter seasonal wool fabrics have recently continued to arrive at the port, and merchants have successively opened for business. Sichuan merchants were the first to request samples and inquire, as their route is long, so they purchase early every year. Yesterday, the wholesale opening price for first-grade herringbone overcoating was 6.75 yuan per yard, second-grade was 5.5 yuan, and ordinary grade was 4.25 yuan. The second-grade herringbone wool flannel from Meiya Li Feng Chang Ming Maigao opened for sale at 2.8 yuan, and first-grade riding breeches also opened for sale at 7.15 yuan. 18,000 series Shavei opened for sale at 5.5 yuan, 41,000 series flannel opened for sale at 4.75 yuan, and most of the Melton opened for sale at 2.4 yuan. Baoda plaid rough flannel by the roll opened for sale at 1.1 yuan.</p>

<h3>Old Sayings</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>If we remove the blindfold from the eyes of religious figures, we can know that the God or deities worshiped by religious figures are not the protectors of humanity. If deities are the personification of nature, then humanity is in opposition to nature. This concept of opposition existed in the early legends of various nations.</p>
<p>According to the early legends of various nations, the earliest rulers were always gods, or beings between gods and humans, or descendants of gods. And the majority of those who revered the gods were created by the gods from special materials. In Hebrew lore, God created man from dust; in Chinese mythology, Nuwa molded humans from yellow earth; and among the Seminoles and Choctaw tribes of North America, there is a myth of the "God of Life" creating humans from mud. These inferior beings, less valuable than "straw dogs," created by the gods, naturally exist or are eliminated according to the whims of the creator. In ancient times, there may have actually been a worldwide flood, hence the widespread flood legends among various peoples. All religious figures use these legends as material for their preaching. The Old Testament says: "The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. The Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. The Lord said, 'I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth...'" Among the TupjGuaran tribe of South America, there is a similar story: the creator god Monan felt that humanity was too bad, so he decided to destroy the world with fire. The great wizard Irin Mape, in order to save humanity, sent rain to extinguish the fire, resulting in a devastating flood. In Aeschylus's tragedy Prometheus Bound, there is also such a story, saying that Zeus intended to destroy humanity and create a new race. Prometheus, this giant, out of love for humanity, stole fire and gave it to humanity, thus incurring Zeus's wrath and being chained to the rocks of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>All these legends show that humans and nature are standing in opposition, with no room for reconciliation. Either humans use nature and conquer it, or humans are conquered by nature and destroyed by it. Therefore, the ideal world envisioned by those who advocate a return to nature or harmony with nature: "In the age of highest virtue, their actions are simple and honest, their vision is straightforward; all things grow together, quickly returning to their origin, birds and beasts form herds, and plants grow tall. Therefore, birds and beasts can be tethered and roam; birds and magpies' nests can be climbed and disturbed..." is by no means a paradise. The Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve lived, as described in the Old Testament's Book of Genesis, is merely a deceptive allegory of religious figures. On the contrary, the fact that Eve, the female ancestor of humanity, was tempted by the serpent, picked the fruit of wisdom, and ate it with Adam, thus "their eyes were opened," and for this reason they were expelled from the Garden of Eden and "in toil shall you eat of it all the days of your life," precisely illustrates the upward progress of humanity, and by no means its fall. Therefore, the lines Milton laments for Adam and Eve in Paradise Lost:</p>
<p>"Earth trembled from her entrails, as again</p>
<p>In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan;</p>
<p>Sky loured, and, muttering thunder, some sad drops</p>
<p>Wept at completing of the mortal Sin Original..."</p>
<p>We can also say the opposite: the trembling of the earth, the groaning of nature, and the lowering of the sky are precisely the fear of all nature towards humanity's conquest of it, and not the fear of nature for humanity's sin. The inevitable demise of a world ruled by gods and the gods' fear of humanity was already felt by the preachers of the gods. The old Book of Genesis says: After the flood, "Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. As people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. They said to each other, 'Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly.' They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar. Then the said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves; otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.' But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, 'If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.' So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city."</p>
<p>This meaning precisely illustrates the power that nature exerts on humanity and humanity's attempts to conquer nature.</p>
<p>In the same sense, in the aforementioned Greek tragedy Prometheus Bound, Prometheus, the protector of humanity, in order to protect humanity, taught people to build houses, to recognize the seasons, to understand production, to create writing, to plow with oxen, to acquire medical knowledge, to unite, and to use iron, metals, etc., to resist the power of nature. Weak humanity obtained such weapons, and one day they will overthrow the master of the universe, the newly emerging tyrant Zeus, from that glorious throne.</p>
<p>Aeschylus had two other tragedies with the same character as the protagonist that have now been lost, one called The Fire-Giver and Prometheus Unbound. It is said that in the latter play, Prometheus did not meet his predestined fate, as described in Prometheus Bound, and perish, but Prometheus himself finally reconciled with Zeus. The English poet Shelley was not very satisfied with such an ending. So he also created a poetic drama called Prometheus Unbound. In the preface to this play, Shelley said: "I am very disgusted with the ending of the protector of humanity reconciling with the oppressor of humanity. The moral significance of this fable is supported by Prometheus's suffering and patience. If we think that he submitted to his enemy, that meaning is completely eliminated." Therefore, in his play, Zeus finally walks towards his fate of destruction, and humanity also finally reaches the "classless realm" of "unrestricted equality, freedom of the idol." In this way, in Shelley's play, there is another meaning existing.</p>
<h3>A Sleepless Night (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Long Zaitian</p>
<p>Ke Liangfu, because of his neurasthenia for two months, moved to Town T, sixty miles outside the city, for convalescence. Town T is famous for its hot springs, and most people who have never been there would probably imagine a beautiful and picturesque scenery. But in fact: the mountains are so small that it may take less than ten minutes to go around them, and it is a barren, bald mountain; the northern part does have more than a hundred black pines, but they were planted not long ago and have not yet provided shade; the houses are so simple; the streets are so deserted and messy...</p>
<p>The place where Ke Liangfu lives also does not have electric lights installed. Coupled with the annoyance that summer night country mosquitoes inflict on people, it is quite alarming. Therefore, before the long black night had completely occupied the position of dusk, he quietly climbed into his solitary bedroom and lay down.</p>
<p>When he first got into bed, he was quite tired, and it seemed like a good dream would follow. Because during the long summer, he had never slept a nap, especially recently. In order to seek a sweet slumber, he always took a solitary walk for about an hour before and after the mountains at dusk, which was indeed a bit exhausting. But as soon as he closed his eyes, inexplicably, as usual, all the unpleasant thoughts, like the annoying mosquitoes outside the tent, flew together again.</p>
<p>At first, he was still calm, deliberately scratching his cheek leisurely, scratching his ears, looking at the top of the tent, and sometimes thinking about some of his proud deeds in his life to suppress these unpleasant thoughts. However, because he was still young, there were too few proud deeds. In less than a few minutes, this momentary joy withered like a ephemera, and he still held the city of sadness of ten thousand hu, so he turned over. Sometimes he also thought of memories close to debauchery; sometimes he even thought of fantasies that might be extremely far away. However, what he could not resist was the fact that the pale face of his mother, who was worried and unhappy everywhere after his eldest brother and third sister had an accident and misfortune, also flashed before his eyes. Turning over is like the mosquitoes flying a little farther after being driven away, but flying back again in a moment!</p>
<p>And at this time, his thoughts were really stuck in a dead end, no matter how hard he struggled, he could not get out. Outside the room: Kang Yu and Li Meina had also been lying down for a long time. And Kang Yu, before turning off the lights, habitually called out to him in a Sichuan accent, teasingly:</p>
<p>"Ke Liangfu is still playing dead? Really asleep?"</p>
<p>He was afraid that once he answered, it would further stimulate the excitement of his nerves, so he also habitually answered him with silence. But he could not help but feel a burst of irritability, and then he also habitually began to count the numbers one two three four five... Although he also knew it was ineffective.</p>
<h3>Manufacture</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Insult</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The streetcar rang its bell, "ding-ding," and stopped at a platform. Lin, carrying her silk umbrella and purse, got off the streetcar.</p>
<p>The broadcasting from a wireless radio in a store across the street caught her attention. She looked up and saw her beautiful face reflected clearly in the mirror embedded in the display window. Her face was flushed with anger, and a few beads of sweat dotted her forehead.</p>
<p>Instinctively, Lin took out her handkerchief and wiped the sweat from her forehead. At the same time, the impression from that brief moment on the streetcar reappeared before her eyes.</p>
<p>It was truly outrageous! How could people see the position of women in society as so low? Did women not have independent personalities and were instead meant to be played with by the masses? She felt that those few minutes on the streetcar were an unforgettable humiliation in her life.</p>
<p>The story was this: In the morning, she had accidentally broken her only washbasin in the dormitory. Moreover, the towel she often used was also somewhat dirty and old. She also needed to replenish several daily necessities and cosmetics. For these reasons, Lin, who usually disliked going out, had no choice but to venture out to make purchases.</p>
<p>The weather was unusually hot, and the asphalt on the road was melting in the sun. The rickshaw pullers took the opportunity to raise the price of their labor. A short distance was being quoted at more than two dimes, which Lin, limited by her financial circumstances, could not afford. To save some money, she had to hold her silk umbrella and walk to the streetcar stop, which was over a hundred steps away from her school.</p>
<p>Standing under the scorching sun, waiting for the distant streetcar to arrive, was a very uncomfortable experience. Finally, she managed to see the car arrive, but the people getting on and off were extremely crowded. Lin patiently waited for everyone to board before stepping onto the streetcar steps. At this moment, the car bell rang, and the car started moving. Lin jumped up with all her might, but failed to get on, making her very anxious. Fortunately, the ticket seller standing by the car door pulled her arm, finally pulling her onto the car. Initially, she was very grateful to him, but when she looked up and saw the ticket seller's grinning mouth and the passengers' strange smiles, she realized that she had been taken advantage of. This unexpected insult made her angry, but what could she do? She could only barely endure it and walk into the carriage.</p>
<p>The carriage was already packed, with people even hanging from the rattan loops. Lin had to lean against the car door, and her legs, which had been standing for a long time, gradually felt unable to support her. At this moment, a young man in a smart suit suddenly stood up and offered her his seat. Lin accepted his kindness without hesitation and gave him a grateful glance. She thought that there were still a few polite people among the Chinese.</p>
<p>This young man stood in front of Lin, his eyes constantly glancing at her face. Lin didn't pay attention and proceeded to take out money to buy a ticket. But gradually, she felt something was wrong. She felt a heavy pressure on her knees. A lewd smile tempted her; it was the young man who had given her the seat. At the same time, when the ticket seller handed her the ticket, he intentionally or unintentionally touched her fingers. All these insults filled her with anger. Without saying a word, she jumped up and stood again, letting the car shake her body to her destination.</p>
<p>Past impressions unfolded one by one before Lin's eyes. Deep sorrow bit into her heart like a snake. She thought that the slogans of the women's movement had been shouted in China for over a decade, but they still could not change the condescending and playful attitude of people in society towards women. Whose fault was this? She regretted not being willing to spend the extra money and take a rickshaw.</p>
<p>But the past was already in the past. Besides suffering some insults, there was no real loss, so there was no need to think about it anymore. So, she calmed down and walked into the store.</p>
<p>The electric fan turned briskly above her head, and a cool breeze blew over her body. All her anger was blown away by the wind, and her spirits rose again. She patiently looked carefully for the items she needed, moving from one counter to another. A delicately designed electric jade container caught her eye. She couldn't help but pick out a washbasin from it and asked the male clerk behind the counter:</p>
<p>"Hey! How much does this sell for?"</p>
<p>"Fifty-six cents!" the clerk said in a frivolous tone, while making a face at Lin.</p>
<p>Lin hesitated. Spending so much money on a washbasin seemed too extravagant. But looking closely at the delicate container, she couldn't bear to put it down. So, she ventured to try bargaining.</p>
<p>"Will you sell it for thirty cents?"</p>
<p>"Hmph! Thirty cents? You can only buy... haha!..." The clerk laughed lightly and turned to another clerk beside him, who also laughed strangely.</p>
<p>Lin couldn't help but become furious. Daring to use such a rogue tone towards a customer, and especially a young woman, was unacceptable. She really wanted to slap the clerk twice across the face. But seeing the people around her and thinking that she was just a woman, and could not win against others in any way, she had to swallow her anger and put down the washbasin, walking out of the store.</p>
<p>Finally, she bought what she needed in a store with female clerks. Although the female clerk's face was very cold when she made the transaction, Lin felt much more at ease. She sighed softly, feeling that this day of humiliation and suffering had finally come to an end.</p>
<h3>Also Lili's Gaze</h3>

<h3>University Days (33)</h3>
<p>— Written by Storm of Germany, translated by Chen Yin</p>
<p>I don't know why I was startled when I heard this. I was about to ask this braggart more, but suddenly remembered that I had seen lame Mary sitting in the landlord's side room when I went out just now.</p>
<p>I immediately set off for home, and half an hour later I was standing beside her talking to her.</p>
<p>"Haven't you seen Lena Li for a long time?" I asked.</p>
<p>She was silent for a while. "I don't do needlework with her anymore," she said, her eyes fixed on her work.</p>
<p>"You used to be good friends!"</p>
<p>"Used to be, yes!"—She rubbed the newly sewn lines with her fingernail for a while. "But since she danced with the university students in the suburbs.... He is not often at the old aunt's house now; I'm afraid the will will also be changed."</p>
<p>"Oh, so that's what happened!" I thought—Christopher sent back the borrowed money shortly after he left, with a few simple words saying that he was very popular in his uncle's house, and the old couple and their middle-aged daughter liked him, and he was very busy with work.</p>
<p>Since then I have not heard from him or Nali.</p>
<p>"But, how could this happen?" I asked again after a while, while the seamstress was busy with her needlework.</p>
<p>"It's like this!" she said, inserting the needle into the clothes. "Two weeks before Pentecost, Nali was already annoyed; at first I thought it was because the carpenter hadn't written to her for a long time, but sometimes I felt as if this marriage made her uncomfortable, and she didn't seem to know what to do. She often lost her temper and didn't care about offending me or the noble customers: especially when she heard the music in the dance hall, she lost her temper even more, because she had promised the carpenter not to go to the dance hall again. One evening we were sitting on the bench at my door, and my nephew and a few buddies came to my house to chat. He is a tailor and just returned from abroad the day before. He had traveled to the Rhine River area and worked in two or three cities there; he said the names of these cities, but I forgot them. Other buddies asked him, and he talked about it.—'Have you seen Christopher, Werner?' someone asked.—'The carpenter? I did see him; he is having good luck.'—'What's good?' another asked.—'What's good? He married the master's daughter; she has... you understand what I mean?' He made a gesture as if counting lines. I felt very sad when I heard this. 'Child, wake up!' I said, 'What are you talking about!'—'Duh, aunt, I am very awake!' he shouted, 'I was still next to him when he was planing the board to make his wedding bed!'——Nali heard this, stood up from the bench without saying a word, took her hat, and walked down the street without looking back. 'What sad thing happened to her?' my nephew asked. —'I don't know, Dietrich.'—I really didn't know. She and the carpenter were not very enthusiastic, because he had been chasing her for a long time, and she had considered it twice before promising. Although I already knew about her and that noble young master, that university student, I never thought that he would completely confuse her stubborn mind like this.</p>
<p>'I sat with them for a while, listening to the child, the carpenter, tell some stories; but I only listened with half an ear, and soon I couldn't bear it anymore, because I was very concerned about her.</p>

<h3>Ping City Bans Renting Wives</h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping on the 24th stated: "The city government recently learned from a report on the 22nd that there is an evil trend of renting wives in Ping City. If true, it is extremely detrimental to public morals. Today, the Public Security Bureau was instructed to direct its subordinates to pay close attention and conduct strict investigations and bans."</p>
<p>The evil trend of renting wives in China, I think, is by no means "news" that has only been "discovered" today. Not long ago, Shanghai newspapers published a communication from the provincial capital of Guizhou, saying how prevalent this trend is there, and the facts of how much money it costs to rent for a year and how much money it costs to rent for a month. In Beiping, as I know from my years of living there, this matter has indeed been embellishing our "sunset of the ancient city" old capital. If you go to the surrounding towns or the Tianqiao area to investigate, there is also a kind of "deceiving superiors but not inferiors" market quotation for the rental of wives. The Chinese have always been accustomed to wearing high hats and building temples, looking down at the world with squinting eyes, how can they see through this hell-like situation; even the general scholars and gentlemen, when they arrive in Beiping, only know how majestic and secluded the three palaces and three seas are. These things are seen by them without knowing, and known without speaking.</p>
<p>So why did this trend suddenly spread to the newspapers and cause the authorities to strictly ban it? Readers probably still remember that since Luandong became a war zone and the rogues ran rampant, many "societies" have been formed accordingly, and they are about to start the business of "pawning children" and "mortgaging women." There is an old Chinese saying that there are no intact eggs under a capsized nest. After a period of panic in northern China, it seemed that Ping City had entered the same situation. The problem is very clear. When pawning children and buying sons and daughters is forced to grow secretly, why wouldn't the "evil trend of renting wives" prevail under the same reason? Even close flesh and blood must be separated. How can we talk to them about morality and shame.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, we don't want to extend it to discuss the women's issue, because discussing women's liberation in this matter itself is equivalent to a kind of literary game. The central issue lies in how to eliminate the root cause of renting wives. Of course, this root cause has its own root cause. As long as everyone treats others as they would like to be treated, no one wants to rent their wife to others, but they themselves wear a "green hat" in vain. If "renting wives" is strictly prohibited with "morality" as the focus, this is tantamount to advising people, "It doesn't matter if a 'true man' starves to death," but he must never wear a "green hat." Therefore, as soon as the ordinance is implemented, many people who wear "green hats" can temporarily "not rent their wives" for fear of power, but under the pressure of hunger and cold, how can they guarantee that they will not change from long-term "rental" to short-term sale? But in this way, I don't know what is called "morality," how will it survive, and where will it not harm morality.</p>
<h3>Riverside</h3>
<p>— Da Yun</p>
<p>The yellow sandy river, here it is particularly narrow, the tide rushes down from a high place, whirlpools are swirling on the water, and white waves are splashing high.</p>
<p>The embankment is wet. The green grass can no longer withstand trampling, showing a declining state. Groups of shepherd boys, sitting sideways on the backs of cows, whistle lightly, and some raise their voices and sing popular folk songs in the village, heading towards the villages with rows of houses emitting curling smoke.</p>
<p>The horizon is full of red clouds, which do not look like the afterglow of the setting sun. A cool breeze blows in gusts, and swarms of red dragonflies fly towards the other shore along the wind. Sensible adults, everyone expects unfortunate things to happen to them, unlike those young lads, who still sing joyful tunes, harbor a gloating mood, and spend their days carefree.</p>
<p>Blood-red clouds, yellow muddy river water, with a cool and humid wind, swarms of red dragonflies... these, in the eyes of experienced people, are originally omens of floods.</p>
<p>The river water is only a few feet away from the embankment. Undoubtedly, the disaster of water is possible. Based on everyone's past experience, if the sky rains again and the upstream mountain torrents break out, and the fierce water flow pours down, the embankment will inevitably be breached. Then, the crops cultivated so hard for months will be flooded by the overflowing torrents. So, the autumn harvest that the farmers have been looking forward to will turn into nothing. Looking at the swirling river in the heart of the river, the white waves splashing, everyone's mind is imprinted with the ghostly shadow of this terrible flood.</p>
<p>"The God of Heaven really intends to make fun of us farmers!" Brother Xiuqin looked up at the red sunset in the sky and murmured with emotion.</p>
<p>"Isn't it? Last year, the fields were so dry that they were cracked, and the seedlings were scorched and hung down to the ground in rolls. No matter how we invited the Dragon King, promised a bunch of three-seven-one and piously prayed, he still refused to rain. It's really his mother's..." Grandpa Xiong, who was full of vigor, although he was not young, always spoke with a bit of wildness and anger. He was not afraid of the sky—since last year he had not trusted the gods, the Dragon King, this kind of vague bodhisattva. He did not believe that cursing the sky and the bodhisattva would lead to any "sin" and be punished.</p>
<p>Thinking of the drought last year, Grandpa Xiong's chest suddenly felt as if a sharp knife was inserted into it! He had lived so many days, and had never seen a drought as fierce and terrible as last year! There was also a drought more than ten years ago. Although there was no thin porridge to eat at that time, at least wild water chestnuts and grass roots were enough to get by. But in last year's drought, even tree bark and tree roots were peeled off and dug up. Then, the plague spread and raged in the village. Every day, people in the village were packed into thin wooden boxes and carried to the desolate tombs outside the village; his wife and son, under the wings of this plague that had no bloody smell and yet killed people without batting an eye, were taken to heaven, leaving him alone.</p>
<p>Looking at the surging river water full of yellow mud, and listening to the leisurely and seductive frivolous folk songs that wafted out of the mouths of the shepherd boys sitting sideways on the backs of cows, this made a raging flame burst out of Grandpa Xiong's heart. He cursed angrily: "You unkillable wild things, you simply don't know how to die and you're still singing your mother's fart song! When the flood comes, don't expect to have tree bark and tree roots to fill your belly. Big fish are waiting for your floating corpses. Humph, wild things who don't know how to die! Still singing your mother's fart song!"</p>
<p>In the northwest corner of the sky, clusters of black clouds tumbled, quickly swallowing the fiery red sunset. Lightning flashed in the black clouds, carving golden snakes, and thunder rumbled faintly. "It's going to rain again up there." Leaning his head, he said to Brother Xiuqin: "The flood is inevitable, alas, everything is over!" Grandpa Xiong looked at the swirling eddies and splashing waves on the water and sighed blankly.</p>

<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>— Mou Mu</p>
<p>A person, traveling alone in a foreign land, for the sake of life and environment, his residence is just like floating duckweed on the water, without a fixed place. And renting a house from someone else is also full of unspeakable troubles and inconveniences. Often, because of other people's likes and dislikes, or because of one's own reasons, one has to sulk and pout to move east and west. Although I am not yet qualified to establish a "home," just moving these few boxes, beds, tables, and some scattered things, books, and the like is enough to cause a headache.</p>
<p>After settling in a house, I often feel that the things I need daily are always lacking this or not prepared that. For a small cardboard box or a small nail, I often get annoyed and swear, and it is also common to complain a lot to myself. However, although I usually feel that there are too few things to use, once I move, I feel that there are too many useless things to move, such as paper, cardboard boxes, small bottles, broken shoes, and rotten boxes. As a result, a large batch of waste is discarded. Sometimes, for the sake of calculating transportation costs, tables, chairs, and iron beds have to be discarded. Although I feel very distressed, there is nothing I can do.</p>
<p>Now I have to move again.—I am not qualified enough to say "moving home"—but where to move to? This is difficult for me again. The alley houses in Shanghai are not something I dare to experience in this hot weather; still in Jiangwan, but it is really too difficult to find a place with tap water for me to wash. What's more, I want a building? Under the scorching sun, I ran all day with sweat on my head, and when I came back, I could only lie on the messy bed and sigh. The days are almost over. After seeing off the friends who went home, looking at the messy room: the empty bookshelves, the torn wallpaper, the dusty tables and chairs, I really feel anxious and desolate. I didn't expect this small moving problem to disturb my heart so much!</p>
<p>In the morning, the landlord had already come to inform me that the new tenants would move in this afternoon. But I'm still going in circles! I have learned a little bit of cunning after living in Shanghai for a few years. I know that Shanghai's worldly affairs are not built on "friendship"; in order not to be looked down upon, it is better to be sensible. I made a decision and spent a whole morning moving to this new residence.</p>
<p>Although the house is a newly built small foreign house, living on the ground floor, there are many poisonous mosquitoes in the countryside. In this way, it is really impossible for me to write under the lamp. During the day, there is either the heart-rending crying or the children's shouting. However, this place is still considered the best choice. I can't be picky anymore, because I am poisoned by hygiene and I am used to taking a bath every day. This place just has tap water for me to use.</p>
<p>Regarding a new residence, no matter how satisfactory it is beforehand, in the first few days after moving in, I always feel unfamiliar and unaccustomed. What's more, I am no longer living in a house that I own. For example, when using boiling water, I have to wait until the servants of others are done. As a result, I often have to take a thermos to the teahouse to make it. If I weren't hungry, I really wouldn't be happy to wear shoes and socks to the restaurant for lunch every day. Now I continue to know that I have a comfort of having a cook to supply meals. Thinking that there are still two long months of summer, I really don't know what to do.</p>
<p>What makes me even more uncomfortable here is the radio that is never tired of playing every night. Naturally, being able to play one or two sets of Western music, or more noble and beautiful Chinese music, is also quite pleasing to the ears; and the buzzing chanting sound that starts early in the morning is probably when the landlady is sincerely worshiping Buddha. However, the Shanghai people's understanding of business can also be seen from this.</p>
<p>The house is finally settled, although there are many shortcomings. Unless I have to move away in the future, I plan to adopt a wait-and-see attitude and muddle through; life has decided that I can only rent other people's houses to live in, and it is difficult to find things that completely meet my ideals, and I really don't have the courage to enjoy the troubles caused by moving.</p>
<h3>Untitled</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>The several people who lived with me have all left one after another. The pointless annoyances that used to make me feel extremely disgusted have also gone with them. I suddenly feel a burst of lightness, like the kind of lightness one feels running out of a turbulent and long-depressed theater. For almost the past month, I've been detached from the pen that I rely on to make a living. It can certainly be said that this is because the weather is excessively hot, making it impossible to even live, let alone engage in the mentally exhausting task of racking my brains. But it is also because the environment does not allow me even an hour or even a moment of quiet contemplation. This is truly difficult. Just as I was laboriously gestating a drop of thought, preparing for the time when my arm could comb it out, those frivolous housemates who spent their days idly chatting or telling vulgar stories would either erupt in loud laughter or suddenly raise their voices in a noisy melee. Perhaps someone would even pat me on the shoulder from behind, pulling me into their meaningless chatter. Although I showed no interest, their interest was naturally strong. And at that moment, that drop of thought had already quietly drifted away. I had no choice but to helplessly put down my pen and stand up in frustration. Perhaps I would simply slip out the door because their vulgar faces, even if I sat silently, would provoke unwarranted disgust and even unwarranted anger. For the past month, the pen and ink bottle have lain motionless on the table, covered in a thick layer of dust. Now that they are gone, this huge house is left to me alone. I can keep the door tightly shut and no longer worry about who might be knocking, as those knockers have also vanished with them. Even if I occasionally hear a knock or two, I can pretend that no one is home and ignore it. In this way, the tranquility I have been yearning for is gradually approaching, and it should be time to start the writing that needs to be done in silence. I am determined to replant the long-barren inkstone field, but after these days of becoming a wild horse, the excessively active heart is a little difficult to restrain. Everything feels strangely unfamiliar, as if the pen in my hand has become as heavy as a bamboo pole. My brain is like a rusty, long-abandoned machine, unable to produce even a ripple of thought. What can I do? When I wanted to write, I could not find a suitable environment, but now that I have a suitable environment, I cannot stir up any inspiration. I sigh with disappointment as I face the blank paper. And in this solitary mood that I cherish, I am often too mindful of the only sounds in the silence, the chirping of a cicada or the croaking of a frog. During the long and tedious days of summer, from the moment the sun rises, the cicada hides in the shade of green leaves, chirping rhythmically. If I happen to be brewing some literary thoughts, the noisy cicada will immediately steal away my original inspiration and give rise to a different idea and mood. And from the moment this short-lived little creature's song is clear and loud, to when it becomes stagnant, and then to when it becomes choked, I seem to hear the sound of time galloping by, passing from one season to another, reminding me that many things, many things, will fade away like the fading sound of the cicada.</p>
<p>Similarly, what can derail my thoughts at night, besides the distant, desolate sound of a sharp train whistle, is the noisy croaking of frogs in the shallow pond behind the house. Listening to it, it seems to carry an almost desolate meaning. Because it is late at night, and the surroundings are silent and still, the croaking of the frogs is extremely clear and piercing. If it is after rain, then it will be even denser, like a sudden rainstorm. The croaking of the frogs can easily disturb my mind, often making me leave my seat and stuff the spread-out manuscript paper into the drawer, or even turn off the light. Sleep is out of the question. I walk near the window, looking at the dark sky. There is no moon, only sparse stars shining with cold eyes. Listening to the frogs croaking more diligently, in this hazy, confused, dark night, the life of the frog does not seem insignificant, but full of boundless loneliness. And I am not bothered by the frog's croaking that keeps me awake. What worries me is that my thoughts are too colorful, simply impossible to collect. When will I find a topic?</p>
<h3>When the Great Flood Comes</h3>
<p>— Erlang</p>
<p>Uncle He, panting, stepped into his own house. Looking around, the house was quiet and empty, with not a single person in sight. Only the cat was playing upside down on the table in the main room, using its four legs to claw at the air.</p>
<p>"Xiao Niu's mother, Xiao Niu's mother!... Damn it, where did you go?" He shouted, but no one answered, and he started cursing.</p>
<p>Xiao Niu's mother—Aunt He—was at this time in the backyard, tidying up the firewood and rice straw that had been soaked by the continuous rain. She spread out the firewood and rice straw in the yard to dry in the sun, muttering, "All soaked through, all soaked through!" She did not hear Uncle He's voice from the front. Uncle He searched to the back and, seeing Aunt He's leisurely mood, an idea floated into his mind: "Still drying these birds!" He shouted loudly at Aunt He, one might even say scolding her, "Hurry up, the great flood is coming! Pack things and go upstairs!" Saying this, he turned around and went into the house to move things.</p>
<p>The great flood is coming? Aunt He had heard this news this morning but did not believe it would come so quickly; at the same time, recalling the terrible situation when the water came three years ago, she was stunned. Uncle He had already moved a box upstairs from the house and still did not see her come. "Damn it, what are you doing in the back?" He rushed out and shouted loudly, "Come quickly, you'll die in the back!" Only then did Aunt He seem to wake up from a dream, taking two steps for every three, hobbling into the house.</p>
<p>Aunt He was not a capable woman, and she was usually beaten and scolded by Uncle He because of her clumsiness. At this time, hearing "The great flood is coming!" her soul seemed to have left her body for the most part, and she did not know what to pack in the house. Although she also went to busy herself, taking this and taking that, sweat flowed down her face, and she often wiped it with her sleeves, but after Uncle He had moved the chest upstairs, when he wanted to go to the main room to pick up the grain, he turned around and saw that she was filling a small bamboo box with broken shoes and rags from under the bed! This could not but make Uncle He angry, and he shouted at her, "What are you doing? You don't pack the clothes, what's the use of taking those broken things? Damn it, get out, go into the river!"</p>
<p>Aunt He then seemed to awaken and also felt it was funny, why had she packed the broken shoes and rags from under the bed? She grabbed the broken shoes and rags out of the small bamboo box and busily stuffed them back under the bed where they originally were. She got on the bed and picked up Xiao Niu's clothes, Uncle He's clothes, and her own clothes and broken cotton blankets, and climbed down from the bed. After walking a few steps, she was stunned again. She was about to stuff them into the small bamboo box, but the cotton blanket was too big, and the small bamboo box could not fit it. She was about to take it upstairs, but she bumped into Uncle He, carrying a large basket of grain on his back, humming and carefully walking to the wooden ladder; so she put the cotton blanket on the ground next to the ladder, and then rushed to the bed to get the clothes. The bed was an old-fashioned one, a treasure passed down from generations of ancestors, both wide and large. She climbed inside to take out the clothes, but when she was about to put them in the small bamboo box, she looked at them and saw that they were a messy pile, so she thought, "The clothes in the box should be folded well," and put them on the edge of the bed, folding each piece neatly, and then putting each piece into the small bamboo box.</p>
<p>Uncle He had carried all seven or eight baskets of grain in the main room upstairs, but Aunt He's clothes were not yet packed, and the sound of gongs came from outside. Interspersed with the words: "Everyone go to the dike to defend it!" Uncle He was anxious. Seeing her slowly folding clothes, he rushed forward and slapped her, "Damn it, why aren't you faster!" Aunt He took a step back to dodge, but had already taken a slap in the face: she habitually started to cry and make a fuss. She simply stopped packing her clothes. Uncle He, with fierce eyes and a stern face, pointed at her and said, "I'll see if you don't hurry up, I'll beat you again!" Saying this, he ran out of the house to defend the dike. Just as he reached the door, Xiao Niu ran in from outside with a smile, calling "Mom" all the way, "The great flood is coming, it's already on the dike!" Uncle He knew it was critical and said to his son, "Help your mom pack things and go upstairs, I'm going to defend the dike." He also said: "Don't come, you little rascal!"</p>

He returns to his room to tell his beautiful wife, knowing that his mother's orders are difficult to disobey, what should he do? He advises his dear wife to return to her mother's home for the time being, and he will welcome her back in a few days. Lanzhi listens, heartbroken, tears falling like raindrops on her clothes. She thinks that she has entered the Jiao family without any guilt, hoping to serve her mother-in-law and repay her kindness. She doesn't care about thousands of hardships, wanting to live together with him in the same bed and die together in the same grave. Unexpectedly, her mother-in-law in the hall is forcing her, how can she burden her husband with the name of being unfilial? Each word brings a tear, moving even a heart of iron. She presents her husband with an embroidered belt with both hands, and hangs a red silk curtain. She says that this is a trivial thing that is not worth presenting, but it is only to express Lanzhi's feelings. Feelings are heavy and gifts are light, as it has been said since ancient times, not enough to leave for future generations. But from now on, there will be no chance to meet again, meeting only in dreams in the middle of the night. Therefore, she offers this as a souvenir, hoping he will accept it and hang it in his heart. After she says this, the rooster crows and the east turns white, dawn has come. Lanzhi hurriedly changes her clothes, and Zhongqing's heart is even more shocked at this moment. Their hearts are broken inch by inch, and they slowly move out of the room, fearing that they will be separated like mandarin ducks.</p>

<h3>Fatty Guan Turns Pencils from His Navel</h3>
<p>On the day the "Kaige" sound film "Chunsheng's Doorway" was being shot, the actors included Yuan Meiyun, Wang Guilin, Wei Heling, Wang Yin, Fatty Guan Hongda, and Jiang Xiu. After shooting four scenes, it was lunchtime. After everyone was full, they sat in the shade of the green trees to rest and chat. Fatty Guan had a large stomach and a large appetite. Others had finished eating and left the dining hall, but he was still devouring greedily, until he had eaten nine large bowls of rice. Only then did he hum the love song sung by Yuan Meiyun in "Kaige," shaking his head and swaying his hips as he walked out of the dining hall. Yuan Meiyun saw him and asked, "Fatty, how many bowls of rice did you eat today?" "The weather is too hot today," Fatty replied, "I only ate nine bowls of rice."</p>
<p>"Nine bowls of rice is still too little? Oh my gosh!" Meiyun stuck out her bright red tongue in surprise. "Let me tell you, don't be afraid, I've eaten twelve bowls. When I was an anti-Japanese volunteer in the Northeast, I ate thirty large steamed buns in one meal."</p>
<p>"Oh! Fatty, your navel is really big," Meiyun pointed at Fatty's hairy big navel that was exposed outside, and said.</p>
<p>"Big is not strange, what's strange is that it can do magic," Fatty said proudly, "Does anyone want to see magic?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we want to see, we want to see..."</p>
<p>Fatty imitated the demeanor of a magician, gesturing with his hands and feet, sometimes forward and sometimes backward, panting and sighing, sweat pouring down like rain. Suddenly, he shouted, "Come out!" He thrust his stomach forward, and a pencil more than an inch long flew out of his navel. Cheers and applause rang out like thunder. Someone picked up the pencil and returned it to Fatty, who stuffed it back into his navel, causing everyone to exclaim in surprise, dumbfounded. Director Wan Cang was satisfied and rewarded him with two bottles of soda. In an instant, the clock struck, and it was time to shoot. "Kaige" continued shooting.</p>

<h3>Japanese Temple Architecture</h3>
<p>— Ito Chuta (Author), Zhang Guangzheng (Translator)</p>
<p>As the author of this article says, religious architecture is indeed a leader in the architectural world, guiding other architecture. Looking at countries with long cultural histories such as China, Greece, Rome, and India, the architectural art that has endured and still maintains a considerable position in the architectural world is mostly represented by churches and temples. Moreover, modern architectural styles are greatly influenced by them.</p>
<p>Japanese temple architecture also occupies a very important position in Eastern architectural art. The author of this article is a famous Japanese temple architecture expert. From this article, we can get a general understanding of Japanese temple architecture. (Translator)</p>
<p>Religious Architecture and Non-Religious Architecture</p>
<p>In the West, architecture has long been divided into two categories: one is religious architecture and the other is non-religious architecture. Religious architecture is indeed a leader in the architectural world, guiding other architecture. In Japan, it used to be like this, especially Buddhist temples, which maintained the dignity of the throne of the architectural world. But today, due to the decline of religion, the dignity of this type of architecture has been lost accordingly. It has only become a province of the architectural kingdom, to the point where it cannot but be compared with general non-religious buildings such as government offices, schools, public halls, large companies, theaters, factories, and houses. This is a common phenomenon in the world due to the historical trend and the rapid advancement of non-religious architecture.</p>
<p>At the same time, people's methods of studying world religious architecture have changed. It is believed that temples, houses, government offices, factories, etc. are originally all buildings, and there is originally no distinction between superior and inferior. Now, it is felt that there is not much meaning in simply dividing architecture into religious and non-religious types. But now, based on what I (the author) have learned from this investigation, I will describe it in the following:</p>
<p>Here, the first question that needs to be considered is whether temples are religious. Regarding this question, people know that although it has been discussed for a long time, a clear answer has not yet been obtained. If religion is strictly and narrowly defined, then temples can be said not to be religious buildings; but if a broad interpretation is given, then temples can also be said to be religious buildings. Now, let us assume that temples exist because of religion. As for Buddhist temples, they are of course completely religious buildings, which is unnecessary to say. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Architectural History (II)</h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>The Greeks seemed to possess very sensitive and well-trained eyes, so they did not like buildings whose style or proportions were not quite right. They created and completed three model architectural styles known as the "Three Orders" of column-and-beam construction—the first called Doric, the second Ionic, and the third Corinthian. Not only were the capitals of the columns very different, but the moldings and decorations also varied according to the architectural order, and the proportions were also different. Doric was the most plain and the most solid of the three. When the Greeks were conquered by the Romans, pure Greek architecture came to an end. The victorious Romans adopted many architectural designs from their new subjects, but they mixed these architectural designs entirely with their own.</p>
<p>The Romans were a very brave, enterprising, and practical people, not afraid of huge tasks, and often completing them in amazing ways. They were more interested in grandeur and magnificence than in aesthetic completeness. They often used clever methods to achieve huge effects at a cheap price and in a short amount of time, for example, covering houses made of brick or concrete with marble slabs, and decorating blank walls with columns and arches.</p>
<p>However, although the Romans often used such "tricks," they were ultimately excellent architects and superior builders; their great buildings still exist throughout Europe today.</p>
<p>They also had their own architectural order—in fact, three of them were somewhat imitated from the Greek architectural orders, and the fourth, the Composite order, can be said to be their own. Unlike the Greeks, they paid more attention to arches and domes.</p>
<p>From Roman buildings, we can get a glimpse of how they lived—first governed by a republic, then by an empire, from a period of hard work and high efficiency to a period of relaxation and luxury, and finally the disintegration of an empire that once dominated.</p>
<p>The capital, still owned by the Romans, was later moved from Rome to Byzantium (Constantinople), from which so-called Byzantine architecture developed. Brick was a material produced locally there, and they used it with excellent technique, especially for building domes. Roman domes had the same shape inside and out, which is one of the features that distinguishes Roman architecture from Greek architecture.</p>
<p>Then, Christians with even more power than before built many churches belonging to this architectural style; churches from before this period were simpler, based on old Roman courthouses, and most were built from columns and other materials collected from the ruins of Roman buildings. Similarly, soon after, natives living in the Roman Empire also began to build their own houses, using the remaining materials of dilapidated Roman buildings, or roughly imitating them.</p>
<p>With the development of Christianity, the construction of churches gradually increased, and the designs of these churches combined Byzantine and past Roman styles. The result of this mixture was the Romanesque architectural style that we call Byzantine. The Nordic style introduced to England, and the original Saxon style in England, were both products of variations of the Romanesque architectural style according to the location.</p>
<p>Like the original Roman buildings, these products of the Romanesque architectural style after changes also used a large amount of materials as a solid foundation for the buildings; however, from these architectural styles, a completely new architectural style called Gothic gradually developed. This is an architectural style that emphasizes ingenious balance over sturdy construction. Pointed arches and windows began to be used; light domes were supported by stone ribs: the lateral pressure of the arches and domes was balanced against each other to prevent them from breaking and moving. The builders of this period already understood the knowledge of engineering; they used this knowledge to make light materials create strong buildings. (The End)</p>
<h3>The Completion of the Fence at Longhua Airport</h3>
<p>The Longhua Airport of China National Aviation Corporation has recently merged with the airport of Eurasia Aviation Corporation to facilitate travel. The area for aircraft parking and part of the hangar were equipped with wire mesh fences this spring to form the outer perimeter. The total length of the fence is approximately 600 meters, and the entire fence is painted in colored paint, making it exceptionally beautiful. The surrounding protection has been greatly improved. At the same time, Eurasia Aviation Corporation also erected a movable mesh fence sliding gate with a length of approximately 150 feet at its Longhua air terminal. This type of sliding gate is the first installation of its kind in a Far Eastern air terminal. Rails are laid at the lower end, and the project is quite grand. It is reported that the above-mentioned fences and special gates were all manufactured by Shanghai Public Works Iron Works, and they also provided design and installation services. The work has been completely completed. In recent days, the road to Longhua has been crowded with travelers, and those who take the opportunity to visit the airport, upon seeing this brand-new facility, are amazed at the increasing advancement of material civilization.</p>
<h3>From Architectural Art to the Temples of Greece (IV)</h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>——The Most Glorious Page in the History of World Architecture——</p>
<p>(II) The Greek Temple and Capital Design</p>
<p>The appearance of capitals on Greek temples can be said to be a glorious miracle in the history of world architecture; it not only created a vital force in Greek architectural art at the time, but also contributed the greatest artistic crystallization to later architectural art. Therefore, we must give it a great description here. Originally, the evolution of Greek art can be divided into three periods:</p>
<p>(A) After the Inspiration period, the Doric Order appeared as a result. This type of capital was created by the Dorians. The middle of the column body is slightly larger and not very tall; the whole is mainly simple and thick, and is composed of a square plate Abacus, a round plate Echinus, and a round, light, continuous capital Neching, with no decoration; this is a product of the early stage of artistic evolution, so it is the oldest of all capitals and has survived to the present. The representative work of a temple using this capital is the Partheno Athens temple built on the Acropolis fortress; and it is also one of the most famous temples in the world, and its position in architectural art can be imagined.</p>
<p>Some people argue that the Doric capital evolved from wooden buildings, while others argue that it evolved from stone buildings—because the column body is very thick, wood cannot be used to make it, only stone is possible. The most temples of this type are in Greece, Holy, and Sicily.</p>
<p>(B) In the second period, the Ionic Order appeared. The column body is slender, with double discs at the bottom as a base, and the capital is decorated with spiral shapes, so it feels beautiful; the only representative work of a temple with this column is the Erechthion Athens temple built to the north of the Partheno temple, which is the most famous in the world, and the six columns on the south side of this temple are replaced by "Stone Goddess Columns," called Coryatids, which is the first discovery and application in Greek architectural history; therefore, the temple of this column is also a very valuable representative work in architectural history!</p>
<p>(C) In the third period, the fine parts of the column were extensively studied, so the products of this period were very exquisite and beautiful, maximizing the beauty, so the Cornithien Order appeared. This column emphasizes decoration, the column body is very slender, and the capital is carved with a lot of luxurious abandoned shapes (Acanthe's grass leaves). Its origin is a mixture of Egyptian columns and Aceling columns, and its shape is very similar to an inverted bell. According to a famous Roman architect, the first person to use this column did not use it on buildings, but on bronze objects, which was a pattern on a piece of copper on an ancient tomb, which was the first application of the Callinachus people on bronze, and it is also one of the sources of the pattern of this column. Although this column is very beautiful, it is no longer in line with the rational nature of the Greeks. The representative work of this column is the Olimpia Temple, in addition to which it is rarely used; because the style of this column is not in harmony with the Greek national character; fundamentally, Greek art is based on loyalty!</p>
<p>The above three types of capitals are widely used in modern great buildings, and in buildings with commemorative or artistic significance. If we go to the Bund along the Huangpu River for a stroll, we can prove that my words are not false.</p>
