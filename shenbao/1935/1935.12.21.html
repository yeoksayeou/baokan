<p>— 昂</p>
<p>加拿大纔與美國在華盛頓簽定互惠商的復有與日議妥通商恊定以結束關稅戰爭之說此訊初自東京傳來嗣沃太華亦有同樣消息雖均語焉不詳迄今且未見續報但本年十月間加拿大議會改選結果自由黨之金氏已起而代保守黨之彭納德氏組織新政府其經濟政策自必有改弦更張者日加重訂商的固早有具體化之可能性也</p>
<p>今日之日加經濟關係基於一九一三年之商的其時二國對於世界貿易加拿大居第九位日居十二位在一九三二年以前加拿大之貿易額常超過日本但至一九三三年加拿大仍居第九位日則凌駕而上躍居第七位而日加二國之貿易關係日本始終爲加拿大之第三第四重要市塲本年至三月底止加貨輸日總値美金千七百萬元日貨輸加僅値八百萬元數額雖均不大然亦足證加拿大對日仍維持其出超之地位也</p>
<p>自世界經濟恐慌發生以來各國厲行貶抑幣値傾銷貨物日本允甚加拿大爲農業邦惟其紡織橡皮等工業頗以日貨之競爭爲慮乃施行匯兌傾銷稅及課稅換算制以資保護此二種保護關稅非專事對日但對日貨之打擊最爲嚴重日本屢向加政府交涉無效遂於本年七月二十日首决實行通商擁護法對加拿大之木材小麥麵粉紙漿絨布包皮紙及麩皮等八種主要物產課以從價値百抽五十之報復關稅加拿大不甘示弱卽宣布對全部日貨徵收値百抽三十三又三分之一之附加稅此種對日經濟鬥爭之形勢固一九三二年英帝國沃太華會議所促成者今茲加拿大之對日妥恊殆卽沃太華經濟集團勢力渙散之表徵歟</p>
<p>加拿大經濟上離英之趨向觀於上月十五日加拿大與美所訂商的似允顯著蓋美加互惠商的之發動遠在一九一一年其談判所以歷年來迄無成議者半由於互惠貨物之不易解决半亦由於加拿大握有政權之保守份子反對離英之單獨行動今則加拿大之握政權者乃爲離央色彩濃厚之自由黨該黨領袖金氏於十月間競選時卽已預言三個月內必見美加商的之告成今可謂實踐其言矣</p>
<p>美加新訂互惠商的須於明年元旦起生效羅斯福總統稱此約為『二國通商關係之革命』蓋一則此的足使加拿大六十種物品開闢新山塲加拿大對美貨的三分之二减低關稅二則此的實爲對英帝國經濟國家主義之重大打擊也美國務總理赫爾曾稱世界政局之俶擾實以經濟的國家主義爲其厲階而欲重建和平基礎須自改善國際經濟關係入手故自一九三三年六月間世界經濟會議失敗後美國卽對各國分別進行互惠貿易政策先後與古巴巴西哥倫比亞及海地等國締結商的最折美加商的成立以後復與洪都拉斯簽定互惠商的美國此種政策與英前外相霍爾所謂重行分配世界資源之主張顯有分道揚鑣之勢此後英美兩國之經濟矛盾勢必益趨深刻而美當局所　意在重建和平基礎云云蓋亦徒託空言而已</p>

<p>— 黃幼雄</p>
<p>一·國產鉛筆之發軔二·鉛筆製造原料三·鉛筆製造耍點四·筆心製造程序五·筆軸製作程序　六·機械設備　七·其他出品　八·中國鉛筆廠略歷</p>
<p>（一）國產筆之發軔</p>
<p>小小一枝鉛筆，牠的構造，不過是一條圓木，嵌上一段細細的鉛心，總以爲製作手續必不見得十分煩複的。但如果你有機會到個鉛筆製造廠，（例如中國鉛筆廠在上海斜徐路一一七六號）去參觀一下，那未，你一定會得暗暗納罕，說一聲「想不到鉛筆的製造，竟有這樣的困難，」自然相信物力之可貴了。</p>
<p>鉛筆創自英國，時在西歷一五六五年；而最著名的鉛筆工廠，則爲德國的A.W.Fale廠，我們常常看到鉛筆上烙有Bavaria字樣的，就是德國南部巴威略邦之所產，因爲那裏製造鉛筆的原料，頗爲豐富，而工資父廉，所以鉛筆工廠特多，其出品能行銷於世界各國。至我東鄰之日本，想造鉛筆，雖爲時只不過二十餘年，但因人工低廉，成本較輕，故亦能暢銷於產業落後之國家，而運至我國銷售者，爲數至于巨。</p>
<p>鉛筆一物，看似輕微，但實爲現在小學生必　之文具，占　育用品中重要之地　；以中國學齡兒童之　多，　用鉛筆之數量，減未可以估計，但照去年海關貿易報吿，鉛筆輸人我國之數量，巳達一百五十萬金單位之　；常此識字運動正在急進，普及敎育力謀貫現之時，其需要程度自必隨之而增，倘仍須　給於外來，則利權外溢，何堪設想。幸而近年以來，中國之鉛筆製造工業，已肇始　，九龍之　　鉛筆廠創設於前上海之中國鉛筆廠崛起於後。記者　製造鉛筆尙為我國　與工業，　特就近往巾國鉛筆廠參觀，承該廠卞任吳　梅君竭誠招待，細加指示，始知鉛筆製造之稈序，並不像一般人設想之簡單，而鉛筆出品之優劣，全視乎工作之是否認眞不苟。又　於該廠所取用之材料，全爲我國之國產，完全國貨，尤爲難得，故樂就參觀之所見，略爲之記，以介紹於國人。</p>
<p>粘十淘洗</p>
<p>（二）鉛筆製造原料</p>
<p>在鉛筆初到中國的時候，人因其筆心之物質如鉛，故有鉛筆之名，其後一般人顧名思義，誤以為鉛筆即是之所製：（說不定現在也還有人誤會）實際製造鉛筆筆心之原料，乃是炭質的石墨，亦名　鉛（Graplit　），我國山西陝西，河北湖南福建江蘇各省，鄰有出產。天然產品，含有土質或他種雜質，佳質之石墨如山西天鎮之土狀石墨，含有率為百分之八十五，湖南賢慶所產者，亦在百分之八十以上。最佳者為陝西秦嶺附近之鱗狀石墨，含有率竟達百分之九十四。</p>
<p>筆心原料，除筆鉛外，即為粘土（Claye）粘土須十分細緻，不使混有砂粒，始可與筆鉛混合勻浄。這在我國江南一帶，出產極多，不虞缺乏，但須經淘洗，沈澱，壓濾，種種手續而已。</p>
<p>鉛筆外包之木材爲最重要之原料，高級品如鉛筆柏Pencil　Cedar及Incense　Cedar多產於美國，我國東北各省亦有出產。但普通如松杉等常青喬木，以及椴木，紫杉，白楊，圓柏，果松，銀杏，均可應用。中國鉛筆廠常就國內各地，採辦多種木料樣子，加以試騐，以便擇其質地佳者－大量採用。現在所用者則大都為緞木和松杉等。</p>
<p>（三）鉛筆製造要點</p>
<p>製造鉛筆，說說原是很間單的，即一方面用石墨和粘土混和，成　筆心，一方面將木材做成筆幹，放入筆心，即鉛筆成。可是事實上要謀用品這精良，同時又求工作之迅速，非有相常之機器設　和熟練的人工技術不可。劣質的鉛筆我想讀者之中，一定都曾有過經騐的。現在找且把各種弊病舉出一二，隨便談談。譬如你用鉛筆寫字，忽然發硬，寫不明瞭，那是因為筆鉛沒有勻細，粘土沒有提淨，或者　者混合不　均勻，不甚結實；又如筆鉛易和筆桿脫離，那是因為筆心太細，或者所用木材製造時不甚　燥，不甚平直；有時筆桿之一半很鬆軟，而另一半却很堅硬，則是木料選擇配合不得其常。其他筆心易於折斷，筆桿不易捲刨，都由於質料配合不適，製造工作馬虎之所致。所以要　良質　鉛筆，就非經過很麻煩　手續不可了。</p>
<p>（四）筆心製造程序</p>
<p>中國鉛筆廠對於粘土原料，有淘洗沈澱之設備，先把運來之粘土，加以淘洗，後流經數隻之濾筒，使砂粒逐步沈澱。取其輕浮勻細之純粹粘土，再經濾水架壓濾　，將水排除，成爲泥漿狀之粘土，乃置於磨上，藉電力細磨二天，始行應用。故粘土本身已極其細微。此爲粘土淘洗細磨部之工作。</p>
<p>中國鉛筆廠所用之筆鉛，係向軋石廠購得，固已軋成細粉，可是究未勻細，故與粘土混合以後，又須用混磨機細細滾磨，至半日之久。始取出蒸幹。而移至鉛心練製臼，這是搗臼，亦用電力拖動。經過相當時期的搗舂以後，鉛心始具粘件，乃再送至鉛心滾壓機，道機使成塊的鉛心碾成一片片的碎片，道樣的滾壓的須　二十次之多，鉛心才十分勻細，但因質地又鬆，故又須重　搗實。此時鉛心已成黑色之軟塊。遂送至鉛棒壓製機，壓榨出一握粗細的鉛棒，隨榨隨切成小段，復以同樣的方法，使粗鉛棒壓榨出鉛心，即是所用鉛筆心一般的粗細長短。</p>
<p>這樣製成的鉛心，是　的，所以先經一次捆紮烘幹以後，便　入爐中漸漸加以九〇〇度的高熱，使排去水分而硬化再加油蒸煮，等釗冷下時，鉛心就可應用了。此為筆心製作的程序。（未完）</p>

<p>春秋點滴  （茸餘）　　「看人挑擔不吃力，」這是普遍的習性。人民在譏官吏無能，夥計駡老闆飯桶，等到自己做了官吏，一做了老闆，才知當時駡人的不當。　　「文章是自己的好」，因此文壇上多筆戰；「老婆是別人的好」，因此社會中多奸情。倘使交互的改變一下，「文章是別人的好」，那末讓謙君子，儘多處心研究之人；「老婆是自己的好」，那末舉案齊眉，定無離婚脫輻之舉。　　少年能老成，自是佳事。不過一老成而事事退讓，絕不前進，不等於「木乃伊」者幾希。　　中國人一過花甲年歲，便思享田園之樂，國家大事，一概付興後來者肩任，這眞是犯了「未老先衰」病。在外國的政治舞台上，儘多古稀老翁，飛揚活躍，「老當益壯」眞可當之而無愧。老上海  周賢　　「老上海展覽會」，展醫着五十年前的上海，大家都覺得所展覽的，是富有「神秘」，「新奇」的意義。的確，五十年前的上海，和現在是大不相同了。在「老上海展覽會」中所展覽的，還不過是表面上的一些而已，在上海的這個社會層的內面，在這五十年中，正不知其變動的程度，是該怎麼的表現在出距來今。四十年前，有一個所謂「僕歐」也者，在一西人家執役。一天，因給主人拭玻窗，一失足，跌傷了一腿一臂。他的主人見他跌傷了，忙給他錢去求醫診治。病了二個月，醫藥罔効，終於成了一個殘廢者。他的主人，却依然每月給他薪水。後來他的二個兒子，也由主人給入學念書。待到他的二個兒子，都有了職業之後，才停止他的薪給。他的小兒子，曾和我同事，所以我得知其梗概。但現在呢，洋人汽車碾死了華人，還說被碾者自己不小心呢。　　我到上海，已在光緒之末，距今也已足有三十年了。在那時候，洋人在上海，巳有相當的勢力，但社會上一般的心理，都覺得靠洋人吃飯，是不要臉的，所以那時候，會得說「也司，奧來」，而當買辦的，似乎都有些不齒於鄕黨。在那時候的上海，雖然也是華洋雜處，但在實際上，洋人是洋人，華人是華人，洋人果不諳華人的心理與習俗，華人却也保守着自有的道德與生活，絕對不阿附洋入。可是時至今日，僅是短短的三十年，上海人的心理，習俗，道德，生活，完全大變了。一般的市民，甚麼都愛沾上一個「洋」字，恨不得把皮膚漂白，眸子染藍了，根本地洋化一下子。　　在這數十年中，上海的租界，已寬放了好幾倍。昔日租界外的縱橫阡陌，現在都成爲繁華都市了。於是昔日之僅有二三畝瘠土，還須以織履，編籃，或製售紙錠爲副業，以維持一家生活的農夫，現在因地價的高漲了數千倍，而都安坐而成爲富翁了。但是此輩老農的孫曾之輩，現在雖都西裝革履起來，而此輩老農，却還是一身老棉襖褲，藉着一點兒如豆的煤油燈光，織履，編籃，或是製紙錠，勤儉樸實，一如數十年前。　　茶餘酒後，若和此輩老農，閒話前塵，上海的滄桑歷史，或許比「老上海展覽會」所展覽的，將更有價値，更多趣味哩。談兎  楊聲　　關於紀載兔子的文字，在中國歷史上是常常看到的。有時那種紀載似乎在勸誘人們效法兔子，如「狡兔三一窟」一類的詞句，確曾貢獻過人們許多躱閃騰挪的妙法，因此它已一致地被認爲是句萬古不朽的名言了。　　可是，無論兔子怎樣能跑善躱，但打獵的肩上仍是背着許多死兔，可見能跑善躱並不是掙扎生存的方法！然而歷史上的暗示却在勸誘人們取法兔子之所長，那纔可怪！　　不過，爲兔子設想，除跑躱外他有什麽力量可以抵抗許多想攫奪它的生命的野獸或獵人呢？它沒有這種能力，然而它要生存下去，於是上帝就賦予它們一種能跑的肢體，機警的性靈，但是它們仍不能免於野獸或人類的摧殘，於是它們又得了一種繁殖力極强的本領，被殺的固是很多，但產生出來的倒也不少，因此世界上的兔子是不會絕種的！　　我有個喜歡打獵的朋友，曾對我說：「野兔給獵狗從窟中趕出後，那種在奔駭竄的情形，不是筆墨所能形容的。但獵狗的矯捷使它無法脫逃，那時它機警的性靈完全給恐怖支配，連竄帶跳，見洞就鑽。有時它鑽進的洞很淺，僅能容納它的頭部，而它以爲已是躱得很妥善了，蟄伏不動，於是獵狗就很輕易的奪去了它的生命！』　　說文上「寃」字從「　」從「兔」。這是說兔子躱藏了頭部而卒不免於死，在它自身想來，眞是寃枉得很哪！記所見  （李晴）　　在寒風凛冽中我跨進校門，忽聽得對面曠塲上有人在尖聲地高喊：　　「賣小孩呀！」　　聲音是凄厲，陰慘，而且單調。我問同房：　　「對面什麽人在叫？」　　「那是個山東人，賣小孩呀，賣小孩呀，已經喊得點把鐘了，還沒有人要。」　　娘姨却接上來說：　　「李先生，那是騙人的，廚房里已給他騙去了一碗飯，你不要相信他。」「那個小孩倒要給凉死了。」我說：　　「那個小孩多少大了？」　　「纔五六個月哩。」　　門房娘姨搶着回答。　　我想：卽使是騙人，在這寒風凛冽的夜晚，也太可憐了！申報婦女專刊徵文啓事　　本報廿五年一月始，每逢星期六編行「婦女專刋」，旨在探討一般婦女問題。凡有關於現代婦女生活及新家庭各項材料，無論譯著，均所歡迎。尤望婦女界隨時　賜稿。每篇自五百字至一千字，注重實際，不尙空談，一經刋載，酬報從豐，此佈。　　申報婦女專刋部啟小西天  張恨水著　　第二十二回　侠語動脂唇羣姝集議虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚　　看完了之後，他就道：關於籌欵的事，我看就不必辦了。那位姓賈的，出了一百五十元的代價，來蹂躪女性，已經十天理不容。現在我們只要他恢復朱女士的自由，並不要他受什麽處分，已經是二十四分的對得住他，還能退回聘金給他嗎？若是眞退錢給他，倒顯着我們沒有辦法，不過是拿錢把入贖回來的罷了，說出來了，也有些敎人笑話。所以我的意思，老實說一句，就是和姓賈的要人，沒有什麼條件。若是有條件，就是我們的失敗。這件事很明白的，若是公道戰勝了，我們就不必出錢。出錢就是公道失敗，縱然替朱女士爭得自由，那也是我們的羞恥。他說完了，全座得女人，就不約而同的，怒潮也似的鼓起掌來。藍夫人道：旣然大家都贊成我的主張，這就不必再討論，就請周太太劉太太兩個人去當代表。我們不必散會，就在這裏等候回信。說得成那就千好萬好。說不成，你二位回轉來報告，我們一定同去和他交涉。周劉二位聽到，都站起來，向各人看看，問着還有什麼話說沒有？大家全說就是照藍夫人的意思辦就是。周太太便笑道：照說，這個代表，我是不能當的。因爲我和賈先生很熟，我去了，倒疑心我和熟人爲難。不過站在婦女的立塲上，我又不能不去。所以我拆衷兩可，只有說平和一些的，激烈的話，可要請劉太太說了。北海伏在窗后台上，靜靜的向下聽着，連氣也不曾透得出來。這時看到要由那位鮮紅嘴唇的劉太太去作說激烈話的代表，怕是有點兒不稱職。可是他雖如此想着，那位劉太太可不留難，已經是挺起了胸脯子，將高　鞋走得的咯的咯嚮着，走出大客廳裏了。（三八〇）遊踪所至西北行  王穀　　——華山和灞橋——　　車子在潼關，停了半點鐘光景，隆隆地父向西開行了。這回不再是發在的顚簸和搖擺，却換上異乎尋常的慢；慢得使人不相信自己是坐在火車上，而彷彿在什麼時候，不知怎麼一來，換乘了牛車了。　　慢呵！慢慢地踱，踱了幾點鐘，纔走一百多里，到了華山的脚下。自然，以西嶽華山的盛名，是使旅客們要稍微興奮一下的；一座綠色和赭色彩畫成的大圍屛，巍峨雄渾的緊靠在左邊，峯巒，雲彩，樹色，無一不奇，不美；允其是主峯下的一幅大峭壁，頂上　　　　，像誰在揮動着無數柄的利劍，底下，一折，一折，又一折，畫出奇奇怪怪的綫條圖案。一嚮愛好中國畫的我，這時不禁想起畫譜上的大斧劈，小斧劈，亂柴皺，披麻皺了。「誰說中國畫是不寫實的呢？」我自言自語地似乎在和誰雄辯。　　「關中到底不關比外，你瞧！那些大麥綠得多有勁；」鄰座的一位丘八先生也居然讚美起自然來。果然，一路上很久不看見農作物了，這眞是個特別的地方。大片大片綠油油的田，展開在華山的脚下，和山上的草木，互相比賽誰更綠得可愛些似地。我恍惚已回到了江南，欣喜地，愛撫地，不禁對它們發了半天獃。　　牛車型的火車，爬了三四點鐘，仍然還沒把華山摔掉。這固然可以使我們把西嶽看個飽，然而小時候讀過的「朝見黃牛，暮見黃牛。」的詩，却從厭煩的腦海裏顯出了。使我感覺到一　旅行的困倦和莫名其妙的心急，心煩。——這時纔知道我還沒脫小孩子的暴躁脾氣。　　挨死樣的，一站一站挨過去，好容易纔挨到了霸橋，離長安還有二十多里。討厭的路軌，不知在什麼時候斷了，據說是被灞水冲壞的。沒法想，只好下車走過缺口去。這一下，我可又得着奇怪的見聞。　　在冲决的口子上，正有許多路工在修理，他們一剷一剷揮動着，我看他們所剷的，鬆鬆地，一拋下，馬上便四散開來，我奇怪：「這不是泥土，是沙吧？不對！沙怎麼可以拿來建築路基？不是沙，是什麽呢？」我找不出答案。　　過了缺口，又上了那邊的火車，好問的我，再也忍耐不住了；於是便找着一個車上的茶房問：　　「剛才那邊塡缺口，是用的什麽土？」　　「沙喲！」他瞪着眼睛似乎轻蔑我連土和沙都不會分別。　　「沙！堵口子，爲什麽不用土？難道沙比土還牢靠些嗎？」我莫名其妙得還發出　問。　　那個茶房笑起來了。他說：「沙怎麼會比土牢靠呢？因為者二沒有土，所以就用沙代替啦！豈但今天堵口子十用的沙，壓根兒從壩橋過來十里路長的路基，全是沙包子呀！」　　「沙包子？」　　嗯！裏面是沙，外面包一二土。這不是沙包子嗎？」　　「哦！」我驚異透了，同時也就佩服透了！用沙堆成七八丈高的路基，居然敢泰然地走起火車來，眞不能不佩服本領大！我們家裏的土話　　「沙上砌寶塔，隨砌隨到。」眞未免太土了！　　不過，聰明雖聰明，膽大，口子却倒底决了！我不知道在剛决的時候，有沒有人送命在這沙包子上？　　灞橋，本是個尋找詩料的處所，我却尋找到「這個」，太不風雅了。然而無法可想，我只得帶着這個不風雅，走進中國最古的都城——長安國際無綫電空中戰聲中之强大電力播送諸問題  决明　　最近各國鑒於無綫電之發達與普遍，於是乃相競利用爲重耍宣傳之工具，而列强之無錢電空中戰亦卽開端於斯焉。　　在此國際無綫電空中戰聲中，最强而有力者，厥爲强大電力播音台之設立。蓋若用强大電力播送，不惟可以遠達，且足以壓倒他國電力較弱之播音。　　因是之故，——在列强毘連相接之歐洲，以强大電力播送爲中心之無錢電空中戰，至爲激烈：蘇俄境內無綫電播台中，一百基羅瓦特以上之强大電力播音台有十七家之多，其電力最大者竟達五百基羅瓦特之巨；意國亦有五百基羅播音台之設：法德諸國均正在盡力擴充此種强大電力之播送。在東方，我國與日本及僞國間之無綫電空中戰中，因佔有優越之地位，但實際上並不如是之簡單。茲將此强大電力播送上之種種問題’　列說明於後。　　第一，安全收音區域範圍問題。　　在利用强大電力播音以與他國競爭之際，應先决定者，卽其安全收音區域範圍應規定爲多少一點。普通所　安收音區域者，卽在此區域中，以普通所用之三。四燈收音機（備有整流管者）與天綫，亦能明白收音之謂。對於此點，若電波與距離無關係，則問題至爲簡單，但實際上並不如此。電波之强弱，不惟與距離成爲反比例，且因其所經過地方之地形與地質等，而强弱各不相同。是故欲使距離較遠而電波經過時之條伴較劣之地方能得到必需之電波，結果對於距離近而條件優之地方，必致送以比所必需電波較强之電波，在經濟上損失頗鉅也。總之，在設置强大電力播音台之時，應先愼重决定其安全收音區域，務期能以最小勞力而獲得最大效果爲要。　　第二，衰落（Fadding）問題。　　普通以爲電力增加，則收音範圍亦卽可隨之而擴大者，實僅日間而已；一入夜間，則收音常能發生强弱，或失去正確，所謂衰落現象者是。衰落現象普通可分爲兩種：卽近距離的與遠距離的。此處所言，係指近距離者而言；考其所以發生衰落現象之原因，實由於沿着地面而來之電波與由天上反射層而來之反射電波相互作用而起，若此二者間之關係適宜，則不致有衰落現象發生，可「無衰落現象地帶」，嚴格而言，所謂安全收音區域者，實卽指此而言也。總之，在設置强大電力擠音台之時，應詳細調査各地方之地形地質與電波通過時之關係，及該地方衰落現象之發生狀態之要。　　第三，妨碍收音之種種雜音問題。家庭所用之電氣器具，醫院所用之電療器械，工廠所用之電氣裝置，以及其他各種電氣施設，均足以影響收音而使其發生雜音，此點在近代工業地帶允屬重要。欲制止此種足以妨碍收音之雜音之發生，須播送較無此種妨碍存在時所需電波更爲强大之電波，始能見效。然此種電波應增加至若干程度，又非先精細調査其周圍工業之發達狀况及所用電力之多少等不可。　　當然，在建設强大電力播音台時之問題，並不僅此三者，如週數及夜間感度等，亦頗屬重要，但如果欲期以較小勞力而獲得較大效果，則　對於上列點深加注意不可也！使用便利的三管短波機  仲旭　　我們使用短波機，最感覺得麻煩的事：第一件要算調換插入式綫圈，當有時耍從這一波段很快的換到那一波段裏去收聽，這項調換手續，常常使我們措手不及，第二件便是旋轉天錢回路內的小型電容器，因爲這爾容器人體感應很是厲害，要旋到好的一點，也不是易事。　　本年七月份美國Short　wave　Caft無錢電雜誌登載過一張不要調換插入式綫圈的綫路，而用二隻分綫器來代替調換手續，前面所說的第一件麻煩的事就可以解决了。現在再在此機上加一級高放，來免除第二件麻煩的事，豈不是使用起來更可以便利嗎？　　但是爲什麽高放用不調整的呢？因要避免校準二枚錢圈的麻煩緣故，其實短波的選擇性不十分重要，何必多此一舉呢！　　此機的檢波級用最新式眞空管6C6組成電子配合式本來已是很靈敏，再上了一級6D6的高放，成績當然更佳。綫圈共有三枚，包括波長自一百公尺起，到十五公尺止。繞法見圖，L1的兩綫間距離，等於綫的直徑兩倍。L2的兩綫間距離，等於綫的直徑。L3則密繞。零件如下：指向天綫的原理（續）  崇齡　　如另將一同樣的垂直天綫c裝置於離天綫a四分之一波長（入　）的地方，而使其兩天錢同週率的電流相差九十度的相角，換言之，卽使a的電流早於c的電流四分之一週波，則其波塲分佈的結果，可以圖三的F示之，形如象徵愛神的心。其理由很容易明白：因爲a的電流早四分之一週波，c離a又爲四分之一週波，故c所放射的電波到達a時，與a所放射的電波爲同相，互相加起來；而a所放射的電波，到達c時，與c的電波爲異相，相差180度，故互相消滅。是故這種設置，可使電波於一方向相加，而於反方向相滅，成爲單向的放射。這裏天綫c所担任的工作，為一種反射作用，好像馬可尼指向天綫的反射器（Reflector）一樣。圖三　圖四　　指向天錢的目的在使無綫電波由發射台僅向一方發射，故如將圖二與圖三的作用合併，便成功所謂指向天錢。如圖四所示，ab兩天錢相距半波長，司發射作用；cd兩天錢也相距半波長，各離ab平面四分之一波長，司反射作用。依上述原理，所得波塲形狀當於圖四的F所示一樣，而爲單向的放射。　　尋常發射台或接收台所用指向天錢，其發射天錢及反射天綫均不僅爲兩根，常各爲四根以上，以至十六根，愈多愈妙，因天綫根數愈多，其波塲愈强且愈尖；換言之，卽其指向性愈佳。圖五所示爲九根發射天綫並列，各相距半波長；其反射天綫亦爲九根，各離發射天綫四分之一波長，其所得指向波塲如圖六所示，可見其指向愈佳之一斑。圖五　圖六　　以上所述，是以天錢並行橫列，而得「橫」的指向性。同樣道理，如將天錢裝於天綫之上，而爲縱列，則可得「縱」的指向性；如縱橫兼用，則「縱」橫」的指向性均可兼而得乏。茲因限於篇幅，不能再評論。（完）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言愛國運動  子南　　自從北平學生英勇的愛國運動發生以後，各地各界紛起響應的宣言通電，如雪片樣飛來，宣言通電之外，爲實力援助起見，沉寂久矣的救國會等等團體，也紛紛宣告成立，這樣轟轟烈烈的蓬勃的現象是吿訴些我們什麽呢？是告訴了我們靑年中國的不可侮的朝氣，是告訴了我們沉默了四年的民衆，他並沒有長眠不醒，在國難變本加厲的時候，他的力量是更堅强起來。　　當前的目標祗有一個：反對華北「自治」，反對借任何形式以分離國土。　　當前的信念也祗有一個；在保全領土完整，主權獨立的前提下團結一致。把整個中國的民衆團結在一起，同一步伐的向我們敵人進攻。　　所以，時間上雖有先後的分別，空問上雖有各地的歧異，組織上雖有各團體的不同，而她的目標，牠的信念可是同一的；這個目標和信念，不僅是我們堅信着是絕對的對，並且堅持着非做到如此不可。　　在這轟轟烈烈的大運動中，我們看十六日的北平路透電：「隊中有一燕京大學美籍學生與新聞記者談話時，渠不自認爲外人，但以「吾輩學生」及吾輩主張「爲言」。可見卽使是旅華的外僑學生，也免不得爲正義感情所衝動，而爲第二祖國效力！雪地  沈塢　　雪夜中的遠行是可怕的，然而我們畢竟又踏上遼遠的征途了。我們把通帶（一種土布做成的粗大的帶子）綑住了腹部得棉衣，使它增加了身體的溫度；然后把套帽子套紧了整個頭顱，只放出兩隻眼睛在看着路。槍桿兒放在肩膊上，沉重得象挑千斤重的擔子。脚尖象刀割樣的冷硬，很吃力地才拖動着蹣跚的步子，在山野間行進。　　北風呼呼地吹着，雪跟小石子那樣粗大，朝我們的身上，臉上打來。在黑夜裹什麽都看不見，山影是迷糊的。大家象麻木地不做聲，步子槖槖地在雪地上作嚮。人們的脚步把蓋滿了白雪的出路踏成一個深坑，兩邊是陰冷的雪堆。不時有一頓在烈的山風吹來，雪堆就被吹坍了，「嘩啦——」「嘩啦」的滾到山坑　去，有時也滾到我們的脚跟來，使我們駭了一跳。要是步子沒把的穩，也很容易跟雪堆一道滾到山坑下去的。　　我們垂着頭，把兩隻手捲進袖子裏去。眼睛只看着山路，前后左右都不顧。，前鋒的幾個伕伴，　好象忘記步哨的樣子，大家和長伕們混在一道走，人氣盛，似乎也　　溫暖一些。但有時也扁着要掩蔽老閻的眼睛，略爲把隊伍分散一下了；可是一　了個彎，老閻落在后面，看不到前鋒的情形，大家於是又聚攏在一起了。在冷氣威逼之下，大家有時也就顧不得山鼠們的利害了。　　風越吹得起勁，雪也就下得更大了。長伙們大都喘着氣，吃力地挑着笨重的貨物，咿咿呀呀的蹣跚着走。竹老頭更是上氣不接下氣的在急促地喘息着，口裏呢喃着一些咒語；這老頭子的古怪脾氣，是我們所深知的。大家都沒理睬</p>

<p>他，只顧在急疾地走着自己的路。　　轉過了一個斜坡，是望山亭了。前而的幾個伙伴把擔子停了下來，躲進亭子裏去。雪這時下得更大了，山野間噼嚦噼嚦地嚮。后面的擔子立刻加快了步子趕到亭子裏來。竹老頭也吃力地移動着一雙年老無力的腿，一顚一拐的趕着過來。雪紛紛在他的頭上，身上襲擊着。他的身上立刻飄滿了白色的雪花。眼看着同行的伙伴統統跑進了亭子來，然而自已却還落在后面，他抬起沉重的頭，象是想看看同行伙伴，可是一下子却滑倒到地上去了，雪立刻壓在他的身體上；他有點躁念，死命地爬了幾爬，在雪地上掙扎一下子。很快的就給雪堆滾到斜坡下面去。擔子却攤倒在雪地上。　　老閻在亭子裏只顧睜着眼睛，象是氣，又象是駡：「這老鬼眞不中用，這擔貨可完蛋啦！……　　松森和我在大家底驚恐中，跑下了斜坡去；好容易才在風雪之中把竹老頭扶了起來，松森就把他背負到亭子裏去。大家圍住了他，用萬金油揉揉了他的額角，他的體溫好象頓時降低了。氣息是急促地喘着。我們拍去了他身上的雪花，松森緊緊地把他抱住。這之間，大家好象意識着會有什麼不幸的到來，互相獃獃地觀望着。……　　雪沒命地下，山風呼呼地悲鳴，倒在斜坡上的擔子給雪堆蓋着了，老閻焦急了起來，在大聲駡：「松森！打仗救了人，就不要貨了嗎？……」　　松森回頭朝我望望，我會意地就拉着小狗子去把那擔貨挑回亭子裏來。大家的眼睛冒了火，朝老閻瞧着，他可沒理會，只望着遠遠的山景。——竹老頭這時漸漸醒了，張開了老花眼朝松森望：」呵，你，松森——你到底是個好人！……」　　雪終於又慢慢地靜止了，亭子的周圍已堆滿了積雪，竹老頭勉强地站了起來，大家於是又打算往前趕了。望望滿天的陰沉，和滿地的雪，老頭子又搖着頭，嘆了口氣：「唉，雪天雪地的，這世界！……」安貧  楊仲碩　　自問是頗能安貧的人，有時雖然其窮不堪尙能晏如自處，那種少年時代因爲無錢的煩燥好像已被世故磨滅掙盡了。　　處貧並不是一件容易的事，最低限度你得逢事容忍，不被環境引誘，不怨天不允人，能够做到上述各點才配談安貧，除此之外，一番磨折工夫也是不可缺的。　　好比說我從前便不愛走路，一出門口無論路之遠近非僱部洋車代步不可，然而窮了旣無錢僱車，兩條腿却被鍜鍊得甚有勁兒了。　　可不是？從前我沒走過一里以上的路，但是現在此刻卽十里二十里的路也能走了，而且走起來一點也不費力，不但不費力好像越走越精神似的。　　又好比說我從前每星期必看電影三四决，上跳舞塲三四次，但是現在電影院已三星期沒有去，跳舞塲已兩個月未至了。　　假如不是爲了貧窮，這種頹廢的生活，我是决不能輕易放棄的。　　又好比說我從前愛抽上等的捲烟，白錫包，三砲台之類，是不能須臾離口的，後來因爲比較窮了一點，白錫包，三砲台固然抽不起，但是，白金龍，小美麗，仍還整聽買的，可是因爲窮，便速仙女牌，老鼠牌，這些祗賣銅元十幾枚的下等劣烟也抽不起了，於是鬧出許多無烟的笑話來，如拾香烟屁股，嗅給烟薰得焦黃的指頭聊以抵癮等。　　漸漸地我覺得烟這束西給我的痛苦太大了，於是我就立志戒絕牠，初時還有些奈不住的苦惱，可是後來倒好了，算起我的戒烟日子也快十天了。　　以上所舉不能不說是因窮而獲的利益。由是觀之，貧窮並沒有如世人所云那末可怕。　　話雖如此，不過有時貧窮也着實令人害怕，人窮了，不能不睡覺，不能不喫飯。大家都曉得在都市里喫飯固然花錢，睡覺又何嘗不取費呢？　　不能因爲窮而不喫飯，不能因爲窮而不睡覺。旣喫飯就要錢，旣睡覺又要錢。但是，我沒錢，難道便不喫飯，睡覺？得，你得喫窮的苦，上窮的當了。　　二房東討房錢時那副刻薄面孔使你心驚。飯館老闆催飯錢時的那番聲色俱厲的說話準叫你透不過氣。　　房東說「再不把房錢付淸，你得立刻滾蛋！」　　飯館老闆說「不給淸飯錢便不做你的生意了！」　　旣然窮了，就得想些生財之道。懷着一腔熱望，開始託託和自己從前玩在一起臭味相投的一般朋友。那才蹩扭呢，你沒錢了，誰還高興理你？　　日子把一個人的性格磨得又軟又棉。而且近來又受了一班「相命」論者的朋友影響。　　「你廿八歲開始交印堂運，那時便不愁沒飯吃了！眉目鼻顴各運都好，允其是那張嘴，更了不得！」　　得，我便挨着，雖然還有四年我才滿廿八歲。　　安貧之道就是如此這般養成的。共工給顓頊打得一敗塗地，弄得滿身都是傷痕，執着鮮血淋漓的銅刀石器，率領了他的黨徒，直向不周山逃去。（十四）[P嚐着驚惶的苦難</p>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—還鄉苦雪之二</p>
<p>不管故還是多麼醜陋的，或是死寂的，然而，牠總有那可愛的成分存在着，撲進了遠地的游子的心門，禁不住會對於牠生了依戀，思慕。我的故鄉呢？太美麗了，是一幅沐浴後靜子的畫圖，對於這樣的勝境，慕戀當然是有的，但，帶有刺藜的鐵絲，一條條地阻攔在面前，想到家中，想到由家中連署的事情，嘆了一口長氣，哦，我是不能就隨便的回去的，現在呢？呵呵！</p>
<p>緊壓住心頭的跳動，呆木的，看那窗外乾枯了的槎枒披了白的外衣，迅速的向車子後面跑過去！</p>
<p>從開封到鄭州，這一段路程並不怎樣長，只經過小小地三四個站頭，一霎眼，這一條長的大虫就爬到了。</p>
<p>鄭州，一個通商的大埠，幾條鐵路在這里會接着，交錯着，一列車子怪叫着跑過來，一列車子又吶喊着開出去。</p>
<p>提了一個小布包袱，跳下來，我驚惶了，四下里，厚的雪緊埋着空敞的站軌，沒有一個熟的面孔，站役，像天空一樣，露不出一點兒溫馨，好些旅館的紙卡紛列在眼前，呵，到什麼地方去呢？這簡直是一塊不見水草的戈壁喲！</p>
<p>等着，等着，心里想，曾受拜託的人總會來引領我的，可是，一刻，二刻，又那里有什麼踪影呢？後來我想，這總不會是一幕騙局吧？不能，絕對不能，一個沒有金錢的流浪孩子，他又能騙取些什麼呢？</p>
<p>同車的人，都挾了忽促的心情，不多時候，走光了，站上怪靜寂的，北風捲着那不凝固的雪花沒命的在吹着，把圍巾提得高了些，握牢了袖管，不理會那方向究竟是向南的或是向東的，沿了鐵道走去！</p>
<p>—往那裹去呢？自己責問着，憂鬱，浮上了心頭：也許自己的生命會在這里交卸吧！哼，管他呢，假使生命能在這地方毀滅了。那或許就是所謂天數吧？</p>
<p>於是，自己起了一陣小小的悲傷。軌道上，凌亂的遺留着段節的車皮，看看，走出來已經很遠了。把包袱扛在肩頭上，順着路側的邊道，緩緩地行進。遠處，正擺着一個摸不住的空洞呢</p>
<p>—怎麼，你這時候才來？</p>

<p>跟從着進了一家旅舍，一推門，屋裏正燃着一盆熊熊的炭火，兩三個不認識的人圍擺着，手放在火上，好像　論什麽，臉，都充　着陰沉，沒有笑意，火光的紅印在他們的面頰上。</p>
<p>不一會，我們都熟識了，那位是副官，那位是隨徒，那位……</p>

<p>今天起在大光明公映的「夢殘魂斷」Peter　Ibbtseon，是一部非常淒豔的文學電影。派拉蒙的當局，因為過去的幾部文藝電影像「塊肉餘生」「小婦人」等都得到獲極大的成功，所以特地把這部十九世紀英國大文豪喬治茂利爾的不朽傑作，搬到銀幕上去，並特請加萊古柏和安哈婷來擔任本片的主角，在演出方面，確是哀豔絕倫，獲得極大的成功，片述一對戀人，自分飛，但他們的愛情並不稍衰，把半生的生活，寄托在夢的迴憶裏，這確是影迷們不可錯過的一部好作品。</p>

<p>Wakasugi Arrives in Beijing to Convey New Instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Arimaki</p>
<p>Nanjing: Japanese Ambassador to China, Arimaki, visited Nanjing to meet with President Chiang and pay his respects to the new Foreign Minister Zhang Qun. They did not discuss Sino-Japanese diplomatic issues. At 5:30 PM on the 20th, Ambassador Arimaki conveyed the opinions of his country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by Arino, to Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and held brief discussions before departing after two hours. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Article Published in American Publication</p>
<p>New York: Simeon, editor of the "Far Eastern Survey" published by the Institute of Pacific Relations, published an article in this issue stating that Japan aims to turn North China into a source of raw materials and a dumping ground for its goods. This is the main motivation behind the autonomy movement. The publication was published today. Simeon also stated that current facts prove that the economic group of Manchuria and North China is about to take shape. "Manchukuo" has failed to supply Japan with the expected raw materials and is hosting industries within its borders that compete with Japan. Japan's ambition is to develop a large part of North China, so that Japan can obtain a large amount of American-style cotton and no longer buy from the United States. Technical and other difficulties may not affect Japan's actions, but financial problems are enough to affect most Japanese capitalists, who previously invested in enterprises in Manchuria, but the gains did not offset the losses. The addition of North China to the Japanese economic group can change the current situation or change the attitude of Japanese capitalists. (19th National Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Canada's New Commercial Treaties with the United States and Japan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>Canada recently signed a reciprocal trade agreement with the United States in Washington and is also said to have reached a commercial agreement with Japan to end the tariff war. This news initially came from Tokyo, and then similar news came from Ottawa. Although both reports were vague and there have been no follow-up reports to date, the result of the Canadian parliamentary election in October of this year was that Mr. King of the Liberal Party replaced Mr. Bennett of the Conservative Party to form a new government. Its economic policy will inevitably undergo changes. The revision of the commercial treaty between Japan and Canada was already a concrete possibility.</p>
<p>Today's economic relations between Japan and Canada are based on the commercial treaty of 1913. At that time, Canada ranked ninth and Japan ranked twelfth in world trade. Before 1932, Canada's trade volume often exceeded Japan's, but by 1933, Canada still ranked ninth, while Japan surpassed it to rank seventh. Japan has consistently been Canada's third or fourth most important market. Up to the end of March of this year, Canadian goods exported to Japan totaled US$17 million, while Japanese goods exported to Canada were only US$8 million. Although the amounts are not large, they are sufficient to prove that Canada still maintains its trade surplus with Japan.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the world economic panic, countries have vigorously devalued their currencies and dumped goods, especially Japan. Canada is an agricultural country, but its textile, rubber, and other industries are quite concerned about competition from Japanese goods, so it implemented exchange dumping taxes and tax conversion systems to protect itself. These two types of protective tariffs are not specifically aimed at Japan, but they have the most severe impact on Japanese goods. Japan repeatedly negotiated with the Canadian government to no avail, and on July 20 of this year, it first decided to implement a trade protection law, imposing retaliatory tariffs of 50% ad valorem on eight major products of Canada, including timber, wheat, flour, pulp, woolen cloth, wrapping paper, and bran. Canada was not to be outdone and immediately announced an additional tax of 33 and 1/3% on all Japanese goods. This form of economic struggle against Japan was indeed promoted by the 1932 Ottawa Conference of the British Empire. Is Canada's compromise with Japan now a sign of the disintegration of the Ottawa economic bloc's power?</p>
<p>Canada's economic tendency to move away from Britain seems to be clearly reflected in the commercial treaty signed with the United States on the 15th of last month. The initiation of the US-Canada reciprocal trade agreement dates back to 1911. The reason why negotiations have not been successful over the years is partly due to the difficulty in resolving reciprocal goods and partly due to the opposition of the conservative elements holding power in Canada to independent actions away from Britain. Now, those in power in Canada are the Liberal Party with a strong tendency away from the center. The leader of the party, Mr. King, predicted during the election in October that the US-Canada commercial treaty would be completed within three months. Now it can be said that he has fulfilled his words.</p>
<p>The newly signed US-Canada reciprocal trade agreement will take effect on New Year's Day next year. President Roosevelt called this agreement a "revolution in trade relations between the two countries." On the one hand, this agreement will enable 60 kinds of Canadian goods to open up new markets, and Canada will reduce tariffs on two-thirds of American goods. On the other hand, this agreement is a major blow to the economic nationalism of the British Empire. US Secretary of State Hull once said that the turmoil in the world political situation is due to economic nationalism as its acute stage, and to rebuild the foundation of peace, it is necessary to start with improving international economic relations. Therefore, after the failure of the World Economic Conference in June 1933, the United States has been conducting reciprocal trade policies with various countries separately, successively concluding commercial treaties with Cuba, Brazil, Colombia, Haiti, and other countries. After the establishment of the US-Canada commercial treaty, it also signed a reciprocal trade agreement with Honduras. This policy of the United States clearly deviates from the claim of the former British Foreign Secretary Hoare to redistribute world resources. In the future, the economic contradictions between Britain and the United States will inevitably become more profound, and the US authorities' intention to rebuild the foundation of peace is just empty words.</p>

<p>London – The Naval Conference decided today to adjourn from Saturday until January 6 next year. (National Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>London – The Naval Conference is scheduled to continue today. This is the last meeting before the Christmas holiday. The holiday will last until January 6 next year. Representatives from France and Italy will return to their countries for the holidays. Most of the American representatives will use the holidays to travel abroad, with the majority going to Paris. Others have accepted invitations from British friends to spend the holidays here. As for the Japanese representatives, they will all temporarily leave Britain, with most planning to go to Paris, and the rest to the French Riviera to enjoy the warm sunshine, which is better than the gloomy weather in England. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>London – The First Committee resumed at 10:30 am on the 19th. Chairman Monsell proposed extending the Christmas holiday period to January 6, and representatives from all countries expressed their agreement. Then, discussions began on the British draft declaration on shipbuilding. US Representative Davis clarified the US government's position and stated that the US government was considering the issue with a sympathetic attitude. Representatives from France and Italy also expressed their approval of the decision, but pointed out that its application still needs to be studied. Finally, the Japanese plenipotentiaries Nagano and Nagai took turns speaking, raising important questions about the British proposal. According to the preamble of the draft declaration on shipbuilding, each government needs to autonomously declare the necessary military equipment for its national security. However, how to determine the minimum limit of naval power for each country? Japan will never theoretically or practically acknowledge the existing strength based on the provisions of the Washington and London treaties. The Japanese government is dissatisfied with the existing naval power based on the ratio system and abandoned the Washington Treaty, so determining the required quantity based on the existing strength cannot guarantee national defense security. British representatives Monsell and Chatfield refuted these questions. The meeting adjourned at 1 pm. (Japan United Press, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Paris Plan Fails, the League of Nations Council Resolves: Expresses Gratitude for the Peace Efforts of Britain and France, Entrusts the Thirteen Committee to Re-examine the Overall Situation, and Continues to Monitor Sanctions Against Italy <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Geneva – The Council of the League of Nations continued to discuss the peace plan of Britain and France yesterday afternoon at 5:30, and concluded at 6:10 after a short period. First, the Soviet representative, Ambassador to France Potemkin, spoke, strongly opposing the peace plan of Britain and France, saying that it contradicted the principles of the League's Covenant, and proposed a draft resolution, advocating that the Council firmly reject the British and French plan. Then, Turkish representative Rushdi stood up and said that the Council should not condemn the efforts of Britain and France to mediate the dispute, and immediately proposed a draft resolution containing three points:</p>
<p>Express gratitude to Britain and France for proposing a peace plan.</p>
<p>This plan is only preliminary in nature and cannot be used by the Council to take any decision.</p>
<p>Entrust the Thirteen-Nation Small Group Committee to re-examine the entire case of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute based on the principles of the League's Covenant.</p>
<p>This draft resolution was unanimously adopted by all directors. British Minister Without Portfolio Eden then said that although the peace plan has failed, the situation of the sanctions issue has not changed as a result. After the Council adjourned, the Eighteen-Nation Small Group Committee met immediately afterwards, for a very short time, with only the chairman, Portuguese representative Vasco Valerio, announcing that the committee of experts on monitoring the implementation of sanctions is continuing its work. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Geneva – Before the Council of the League of Nations passed the resolution, it had a long secret consultation on the second article, and then decided to delete the phrase "when the two parties have not replied," because it felt that the Council could not continue to handle this suggestion. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Geneva – The Thirteen-Nation Small Group Committee of the League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet on January 10 or 12 next year. There is little hope of re-considering the peace plan proposed by Britain and France. This plan will almost become a page in history. According to observers here, the task of the Thirteen-Nation Small Group Committee in accordance with the resolution passed by the Council yesterday is to "find appropriate ways to stop the Italian-Abyssinian war." Therefore, the basis for negotiations on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute will be found by the committee itself. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa – The Abyssinian government recently submitted a memorandum to the British and French ministers, expressing its rejection of the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute proposed by those countries. Once this plan is implemented, "Abyssinia will establish a political system that is even worse than the trusteeship system, the principles contained in the League's Covenant will be abandoned, and the situation of Abyssinia being divided will be formed." The Abyssinian government is determined to maintain territorial integrity to the last moment, hoping that the League will take necessary measures to stop the war of aggression.

<h3 id="e19">British Parliament Heatedly Debates Diplomacy, Baldwin's Cabinet Wins Victory, Labour Party's Impeachment Motion Ultimately Rejected, Hoare Takes the Blame and is Sacrificed <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>London – The House of Commons discussed the government's diplomatic policy and the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute proposed by Britain and France this afternoon. Prime Minister Baldwin delivered an important speech, and the House voted 390 to 165 to express confidence in the government. The position of the cabinet has been temporarily stabilized, at least in the parliamentary aspect. However, the House was rather cold to Baldwin's declaration. A large part of the cabinet's victory was due to the opposition Labour Party's ineffective attack. When the party leader, Major Attlee, began to speak, Conservative Party members who were dissatisfied with the British-French plan withdrew from the meeting, thus stabilizing the cabinet's position. Major Attlee's attack on the British-French plan involved Baldwin's personal reputation, which was not approved by the House of Commons. This was also a reason for the cabinet's victory. Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain refuted it, saying that Prime Minister Baldwin's personal reputation was not damaged in the slightest, and most members should support him. He also said that Britain should still assist the League of Nations, but only within the scope of collective action, without any ambiguity that would allow Britain's true intentions to be misunderstood. The plan proposed by Britain and France has aroused suspicion, but its original intention was not to disappoint the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>London – The British government has won a victory in today's extremely important debate in the House of Commons on the British-French peace plan. After Prime Minister Baldwin disclosed British foreign policy and explained his advocacy of collective security, the House rejected the Labour Party's impeachment motion by a vote of 397 to 165, and passed Winterton's amendment by a vote of 390 to 165.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Original Text of the Labour Party's Impeachment Motion <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The original text of the impeachment motion is roughly as follows: "The conditions proposed by the government as the basis for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian war are actually a reward for the aggressor, destroy collective security, and violate the wishes expressed by the people and the spirit of the League of Nations. Therefore, the House of Commons demands the immediate cancellation of these conditions." Winterton's amendment, on the one hand, stated that any conditions for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute must be acceptable to the League of Nations, and on the other hand, expressed its willingness to fully support the government in promoting the foreign policy stated in the government's statement, which was supported by the people during the recent general election.</p>
<p>During the debate, the meeting was extremely crowded, with the public gallery filled with diplomats from various countries and important figures, and the Prince was also among them.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Attlee Challenges the Government <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>After former Foreign Secretary Hoare explained the reasons for his resignation, Labour Party leader Attlee proposed an impeachment motion, saying that he expressed great sympathy for Sir Hoare, because the entire government was responsible for Hoare's actions. Hoare only took the blame for others. Since Hoare should resign, the government should also resign. This peace plan cedes half of Abyssinia in exchange for a corridor for camels, sacrifices the aggressed, and grants the greatest concessions to the aggressor. This is not British justice. Collective security and the League of Nations itself will be destroyed by it. The people recognize this clause as a breach of faith by the government in the election, because the electors did not support the government for this reason. Even if there is an immediate danger of war, the government has no reason to take this action. The government should declare that the League of Nations has failed, revoke the sanctions, and should not encourage the aggressor with more concessions than the aggressor wants. This is simply an act of betraying the Abyssinian people. When Hoare urgently needed rest, the cabinet entrusted him with the most difficult task. Before Hoare went to Paris, what instructions did the cabinet give him? This is what the country wants to know.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Baldwin Defends with All His Might <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin spoke with great excitement, first praising Hoare, saying that Hoare still believed that his actions did not go beyond the scope of the League of Nations. His actions were not satisfactory, so he resigned to apologize. At this time, Hoare's resignation was not only a great loss to the government, but also a loss felt by the people, because he was loved by the people. The day Hoare went to Paris happened to be a Sunday. There was no contact, and it was not until the next day that he learned that the agreement had been reached. On Monday morning, he received a letter from Hoare asking the cabinet members to support what he had done. When the government had not had time to study it, this matter had been leaked out. Should the cabinet support or deny the actions of a cabinet member? This is what the cabinet needs to discuss. The cabinet members were not satisfied with this plan, and thought that the measures were inappropriate, but the main responsibility should be borne by him (the Prime Minister himself), so he immediately decided that he must maintain his colleague who was abroad. He did not think it strange that the opposition expressed their feelings, but he did not expect that so many Conservative Party members across the country would have such deep feelings based on conscience and honor. He knew that he was not supported by the majority of public opinion, but if the government ultimately submitted this plan to the League of Nations, judging from the current situation, this plan has completely died. The British government does not want to find a way to revive it. The British government has always remained unchanged in its position, that is, British policy is based on the League of Nations. He is willing to always abide by the policy of collective security. If Britain had to participate in a unilateral war, he was afraid that there would be a backlash in the country. People often said that if Britain supported the League of Nations and was in a position to independently exercise what all countries should do together, then we would no longer allow the government to abide by this collective security, because the decision to wage war would not only be in the Mediterranean, but perhaps closer to Britain. The Prime Minister continued to speak about the effectiveness of sanctions, saying that if the world and the League of Nations acted immediately in unison, the sanctions could be completely effective, but today we have not yet reached this point. Therefore, if the League of Nations, when imposing sanctions, reaches the point where the aggressor is not subject to these sanctions and will resist the League of Nations, then the League of Nations will surely obtain the guarantee that all those with power must support it and will immediately support it. The last sanction of the League of Nations is indeed a great force, but if it cannot be implemented immediately, it will be useless. Because it cannot be implemented immediately, there is a danger of gradually dragging various countries into the war without knowing where it will end. If the free countries of Europe today want to maintain their security, they must carefully consider that the assistance that small countries hoping for the League of Nations can obtain is that the powerful countries in the League of Nations are prepared to come out to assist them in case of emergency. We have now moved from the stage of empty words to the stage of action. The Prime Minister finally asked the House to give him trust. After the speech, there was great applause.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Chamberlain Rises to Support <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain then rose to speak in defense of the Prime Minister. The gist of his words was that it was a matter of public affairs, not our own affairs. This is the true meaning of the League of Nations. If other countries all did what Britain did, then the League of Nations could escape from its difficult situation, and it would be more difficult for aggressors to do what they want in the future.</p>

<p>When Winterton proposed the amendment, he said that advocating military sanctions or similar military sanctions that could have the effect of causing Italy to resist by force is an act with criminal responsibility. If the oil embargo is implemented, causing Italy's armed resistance, then this action would conflict with the government's promise in the general election.</p>

<p>Labour Party member Dalton asked Finance Minister Chamberlain whether he could announce the selection of the new Foreign Secretary. Chamberlain shook his head and did not answer. Dalton also asked whether the government intended to continue the oil embargo, and said that the Prime Minister's words were very unclear. The Labour Party must propose an impeachment. Chamberlain replied that this tragedy had caused the government to lose the service of Sir Hoare. The only comfort the government had was that Sir Hoare had the opportunity to recover his health because of this. He hoped that Sir Hoare would be able to resume political affairs soon. The government had taken responsibility for what the country now considered a mistake.</p>

<p>Someone asked whether the government had inquired about the attitude of the major powers if Britain were attacked by Italy. The Finance Minister replied that if war broke out, the location must be in the Mediterranean, so what should be known is the attitude of the Mediterranean countries, not the attitude of other member states far from the Mediterranean. The British government has inquired about the attitude of other countries, but the attitude of France is very important. The rumor that Britain has not obtained guarantees from several countries is incorrect. If the League of Nations decides to implement the oil embargo, if the British government is well aware that the relevant member states of the League of Nations are all prepared to participate to deal with sudden attacks, then Britain will of course be prepared to do its part and support the implementation of the oil embargo.</p>

<p>In short, the British government's attitude towards the League of Nations has not changed in the slightest. We must take advantage of all opportunities to negotiate an acceptable peace, but if we cannot, we still advocate collective action to seek collective security. However, it must be known that the League of Nations' final sanction must come from force. If the member states of the League of Nations are not prepared to use force to deal with the threat of the aggressor, then it cannot be hoped to be completely successful. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">A Battle of Wits in the House of Lords <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>London – The House of Lords and the House of Commons met simultaneously today to debate diplomatic matters. Many noble ladies gathered in the special public gallery. First, former Liberal Party member of the House of Commons, Lord Davies, began by asking the House of Lords to declare that it could not accept the peace plan and did not approve of any solution that did not conform to the principles of fairness and Britain's obligations to the League of Nations. Davies also urged the government to continue the policy announced by Hoare in Geneva in September, and said that Europe, the United States, and the British Dominions were greatly shocked by this peace plan. The plan has indelibly stained Britain's glory and reputation, and the government has curbed the rising tide of cooperation between the United States and the League of Nations. Lord Privy Seal Halifax replied on behalf of the government, saying that it was not the task of the League of Nations to start a war in Europe to stop the war in Africa. The danger of the war expanding is unimaginable. When Hoare took the road to Paris to Switzerland, he did not order to discuss peace or reconciliation conditions with French Premier Laval. Hoare was involuntarily drawn into the discussion. These conditions were first published in detail in French newspapers. When the British government received them, because the newspapers had already disclosed them, it felt that it had to make a decision. The government did not approve of these conditions when it read them. He need not hide this. The government did not initially expect the public to react to this clause. This is indeed something that cannot be shirked. He thought that Hoare's resignation was enough to thank the people. The spiritual leadership position that Britain has gained in recent months can be consolidated again in the world. The Archbishop of Canterbury then spoke, expressing concern about the government's handling of this most unfortunate Paris peace plan. He said that he hoped that the sanctions policy would continue and that the British government should refuse to participate in any solution that seemed to respect the aggressor's behavior. Lord Allen of Hurtwood delivered a thorough speech, saying that he did not believe Mussolini was making empty threats. He had never taken this action. Mussolini would rather fight with France or fight with us or fight with Britain alone than give in. We cannot now return to the policy of security first announced in September. Unless we are prepared to support any sanctions that can force Mussolini to stop the war, we cannot relieve our position in the League of Nations or the country. Lord Allen's conclusion said, "I have to make a decision, that is, in the danger of the Mediterranean war, the serious development in Europe or the Far East, the only right way is to advance without retreat." Then, Lord Ponsonby expressed doubts about Hoare being suddenly forced to discuss peace in Paris. Lord Strabolgi then expressed sympathy for Ponsonby's doubts and asked, "If it is credible, then what was discussed before Paris?" Finally, Lord Stanhope concluded the debate, saying that British and French experts had indeed discussed the peace conditions in Paris for two weeks, but there seemed to be no possibility of compromise. After Hoare and the experts returned to London, the British cabinet seemed to have ample time to discuss everything, but since it had been leaked by the French newspapers, the British government had to make a decision. Then, Lord Davies' motion was put to a vote and was unanimously passed by the entire House. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>London – King George V recently summoned Prime Minister Baldwin in the morning, and the cabinet is scheduled to meet in the afternoon. The general public attaches great importance to these two events, because the selection of the Foreign Secretary will be decided by this. It is rumored that Lord Privy Seal Halifax will be transferred to the position of Foreign Secretary. This statement is difficult to realize, but the saying that Finance Minister Neville Chamberlain will be transferred to the position is rampant. According to observers, the most promising candidates are actually Finance Minister Neville Chamberlain and former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain. It is also said that if Austen Chamberlain succeeds as Foreign Secretary, the future relationship between Britain and Italy will inevitably become tense. The transfer of the Finance Minister means that the British government is willing to see the tense relationship between Britain and Italy ease. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>London – Political circles here are wondering what Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's reaction will be to the resignation of Foreign Secretary Hoare. The general belief is that Anglo-Italian relations will become increasingly tense in the coming days. Regarding the sanctions issue, political figures believe that the British government can only implement stricter sanctions if other member states of the League of Nations immediately pledge military assistance (land, sea, and air) to Britain. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome – The semi-official Roman newspaper, "Il Popolo di Roma," recently commented on Prime Minister Mussolini's speech delivered at the new village of Pontinia the day before, saying, "If anyone attempts to seize even an inch of land that we have conquered by military force, we are prepared to resist with all our might. The world should understand this clearly. Neither unfair economic blockades, nor diplomatic trickery, nor violence can shake our resolve. We will not allow those Ethiopians who have already surrendered to return to their government, lest they suffer retaliation." The newspaper concluded, "If other countries force Italy to relinquish its acquired rights and disregard</p>

<p>Showing Sympathy for Hoare</p>
<p>London – This morning's newspapers, though politically diverse, all stated that the outstanding figure during yesterday's House of Commons debate on the Anglo-French peace plan was Sir Samuel Hoare, who resigned yesterday as a scapegoat. Prime Minister Baldwin, on the other hand, appeared ashamed. The Morning Post stated that since the government had approved Hoare's policy, it should have supported Hoare through thick and thin, which would have been the honorable thing to do. The Daily Telegraph reported that Baldwin seemed completely unprepared for the intensity of the storm caused by the peace plan. The News Chronicle stated that it was not Baldwin who saved the government, but rather the leader of the opposition party, Attlee, whose speech far exceeded the standards expected in this debate, and whose accusations against Baldwin's honor were also a strategic error. The Times stated that Hoare's resignation was a temporary pause in his political career, not its end. The government clearly acknowledged the legitimacy of public opinion and rescinded its hasty decision, thus quelling the wave of opposition. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

He stated that as a cabinet member, he should have the freedom to act, but this is incompatible with the party's demands. The personal pain he has endured is beyond description. Herriot's political friends tried to persuade him to withdraw his resignation letter, but to no avail. A new party leader for the Radical Socialist Party may not be elected for some time.

<p>Asmara – Italian military authorities announced today that the Ethiopian army, which launched a counterattack south of Magale, has been repelled by Italian machine guns. However, there was previously a fierce battle. (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa – Our special correspondent, O'Chenay, reports that news regarding the fighting on the Tigre front on the northern front is both vague and contradictory from both the Italian and Ethiopian sides. What is known is that the positions of the two armies on the front line have not changed much recently. The Ethiopian army's plan was originally to divide its forces into two groups to attack the flanks of the Italian army on the northern front. The right flank army, personally commanded by General Seyoum, the governor of Tigre Province, made progress and came into contact with the Italian army near the Taigas River two days ago. As for the left flank army, commanded by General Kassa Sebhat, it advanced northwest towards the city of Magale. Due to the vague nature of previous war reports, it is still difficult to judge the value of this operation. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Japan's Ambitions Resemble Those of Germany's Wilhelm; US and Japan Inevitably Headed for War in the Pacific</p>
<p>Las Vegas, USA – Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated today in a speech at the local Rotary Club that the Japanese government's ambitions are quite similar to those of former German Emperor Wilhelm, and that its ultimate goal is to conquer the world. If this continues, the United States, for the sake of self-defense in the Pacific, will have no choice but to go to war. Japan's conquest of China is the preliminary plan for its imperialism. "Sooner or later, the United States must also fight for its survival. If we delay too long, the outcome will be difficult to predict." Pittman described the United States' Far East policy, saying, "We can either retreat and lie dormant, or we can decide on our final stance and no longer retreat." Pittman further stated that Japan will seize the Philippines as soon as it has the opportunity. Pittman then turned to commenting on the world situation, saying, "The failure of the League of Nations is undeniable, especially in dealing with Japan. Japan seizes every opportunity when various countries in the world are facing difficulties to expand its territory. Japan is now taking advantage of Britain's entanglement in Europe and the United States' pacifism, causing these countries to be caught off guard. I deeply resent the policy of appeasement towards Japan. At the London conference, the Japanese representative again stated that, fearing a war in the Pacific, insisting on naval equality is truly unbearable. Japan fears only two things: the navies of Britain and the United States. If the navies of the two countries simultaneously conducted exercises near Japan in the Pacific, Japan could be subdued without a single soldier or bullet." Pittman emphasized the importance of the Nine-Power Treaty, saying that Japan has blatantly violated it, demonstrating its contempt for other governments. "I am not trying to create alarm, but the American people should have someone tell them where the danger lies. Once Japan dominates China, it will become an unrivaled world power and can proceed to realize its dream of conquering the world. Although I support neutrality, in such circumstances, we must formulate a policy early and stick to it to the end." (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>

<p>London – The London silver market eased somewhat today as the United States took in 4 million ounces in the Bombay market, a quarter of which had previously been intended for sale in London. This eased tensions here. Today's sales in London amounted to approximately 16.5 million ounces, with the United States purchasing 6% of it. Buyers are now trying to buy one-month futures at a price of 20 pence, and sellers are gradually limiting sales prices, which shows an improvement in the psychology of speculators.

Morgenthau claimed that he had bought silver every day this week, and the purchase locations were quite numerous and unexpected. Morgenthau declined to say whether the purchases were from private individuals or from the government. Morgenthau also said that although there are no buyers in London, New York can still determine the price of silver, which is very noteworthy. Since London has no market, New York has no other choice. Morgenthau also stated that the US government has purchased 72 million ounces of newly mined silver produced in Mexico in the past year at New York prices. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Moscow – A dispatch from Kulun reports that on the 18th, more than 20 Japanese soldiers in vehicles appeared near the position of the Mongolian border guards at Bulundetson, southwest of Lake Baynor. The Mongolian guards immediately signaled that they had entered Mongolian territory, and they returned to Manchurian territory.

The passenger car contained two Japanese officers and one White Russian, and each vehicle carried 25 armed soldiers. They also carried five machine guns. Without warning, they surrounded the Mongolian guard post and opened fire on the Mongolian soldiers with machine guns. The commander of the post, under orders to avoid conflict with the Japanese and Manchurian sides, ordered the border guards to retreat, but the Japanese continued to fire. As a result, many Mongolians were killed, the number of which is unknown. According to reliable reports, the deputy director of the post and six Mongolian soldiers were indeed killed. A detailed investigation is currently underway. Kulun was outraged upon hearing this news. (TASS dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Nanjing – At the conclusion of the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 20th, President Sun stood up to introduce Vice President Ye, as it was Ye's first time attending a meeting of the Yuan, and then invited Ye to speak. Ye modestly addressed the legislators as "teachers" and explained, "The Legislative Yuan is a place where specialized talents gather. I have neither learning nor strengths. Aside from attending classes and reading books, there is nothing I can say here. Over the years, I have served in party departments and various political circles, and the knowledge I have gained, as incomplete as it may be, I am confident has not come solely from books. The knowledge and experience I have gained at meetings are indeed not small. Since the 16th year of the Republic [1927], my life for the past eight years has almost entirely been spent in meeting rooms. At every meeting, I have listened attentively and benefited greatly. However, the materials I have obtained from attending various meetings in the past still seem simple and cannot compare to the richness of the Legislative Yuan. Being able to attend here is no different from the President giving me the opportunity to attend classes and read books. From now on, I will be able to hear everyone's high opinions often. I would like to express my special thanks to all of you teachers." After his speech, the entire room responded with enthusiastic applause. Historically, Vice Presidents attending meetings of the Legislative Yuan are rare. Aside from Lin Sen, who attended one meeting when Hu Hanmin was President of the Yuan, Ye is perhaps only the second person to do so. Therefore, all the legislators felt a doubled sense of interest in Ye's attendance. At noon, Sun hosted a banquet for Ye at the Yuan's Mingzhi Building, inviting dozens of people to accompany him, including the chairmen and conveners of various committees, such as Chuan Bingchang, Wu Jingxiong, Ma Yinchu, Wu Shangying, He Sui, Huang Youchang, Liu Kejun, and Liang Hancao.

<p>Shanghai Shenbao Office forwards to all newspaper offices, schools, and mass organizations for public information. At a time when the flames of aggression are raging and North China is in danger, all our countrymen should rise up together and strive to serve the country. Therefore, students in Peiping, with their zeal for national salvation, have been holding demonstrations in the past few days. However, the military and police have obstructed and arbitrarily arrested them, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Upon hearing the bad news, we are filled with anger and indignation. The students of our school specially telegraphed the students of all schools in Peiping, vowing to be their support, and put forward the following five requirements, hoping that our compatriots across the country will shout out and embrace this aim together: Oppose the Peiping-Tianjin autonomous government and all Japanese-ruled organizations. Request the central government to implement revolutionary diplomacy and announce the negotiations in North China. Guarantee the absolute freedom of speech, assembly, association, and national salvation movements for the people. Request the government to immediately release the arrested students in Peiping and severely punish the officials responsible for shooting and injuring the students. We hope that the people of the whole country will rise up together and be the support of the government. Xiamen University Student Union.</p>

<p>More than a thousand students participated, and all orders were well maintained</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the past half month, middle school students and above in Tianjin have witnessed the difficulties in North China and the patriotic movement of students in various schools in Peiping, and their blood has been boiling. Last week, with the French Business School as the center, the Tianjin Municipal Students' Union of Middle Schools and Above was organized, and a circular was issued to respond to the student movement in Peiping and Tianjin. At that time, it was intended to make further representations, but due to the vigorous persuasion of the principals of various colleges, it was suspended. On the 16th, the students of Peiping and Tianjin had a second movement, and most of the male and female students were arrested, which gave the students in Tianjin a great shock. On the evening of the 17th, students from various schools held a secret meeting at the French Business School and decided to march and demonstrate and petition the municipal government. That evening, the principals of various colleges heard the news and knew that it was difficult to stop them. They gathered at the Women's Normal College and invited Sun Runyu, secretary-general of the municipal government, Liu Yushu, director of the Public Security Bureau, and Li Jinzao, director of the Education Bureau, to discuss ways to eliminate the situation, and hoped that the authorities would explain the truth about the patriotic movement of students in Peiping to the students. The principals of various colleges who were present were Li Shutian, president of Beiyang Institute of Technology; Huang Zijian, secretary-general of Nankai University; Yang Yizhou, president of the French Business School; Qi Biting, president of the Women's Normal College; Wei Daoming, president of the Industrial College; Zhang Songguan, president of the Fisheries College; Yang Shaoun, president of the Tianjin Normal School; He Kongbin, president of the Tianjin Middle School; Liu Fang, president of Huiwen; etc. The presidents of the colleges stated that Peiping and Tianjin are close to each other, and the student patriotic movement is a legitimate act. The principals of the colleges can only persuade and stop them, but cannot interfere by force. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities have a good way to deal with it to avoid any movement that will put the two cities of Peiping and Tianjin in unrest. Moreover, young people's thoughts are easily radical. If the authorities guide them according to the situation, it will be easy to quell them. In addition to trying their best to persuade the students of various colleges to study with peace of mind, on the other hand, they earnestly request the authorities in Peiping to not go too far, and should be lenient to the students and release the arrested. Then the students in Tianjin will be less stimulated, or the storm may be quelled invisibly, etc. Sun Runyu and Liu Yushu expressed their opinions separately, hoping that the presidents of the colleges would be responsible for persuading the students to study with peace of mind. The intention of the Tianjin college presidents was to convey it to the Peiping authorities. At 6 pm that night, two telegrams were sent out, one to President Jiang and Minister Wang, and one to the Peiping authorities, requesting the speedy release of the arrested students from various schools. At 8 am on the 18th, more than a thousand male and female students from nine colleges, including Industry, Beiyang, French Business, Fisheries, Jiuzhen, Vocational Business, Tianjin Normal, Women's Normal College, and Industry and Commerce, gathered in the Tianjin Municipal Public Gymnasium in Caijia Garden, Hebei. Representatives from various schools gave speeches, distributed declarations, and marched in formation along Daqiang Road, Hebei, North Road, and East Road, shouting slogans along the way. The police did not interfere, and the students also maintained order. Later, they turned to Riyi Road, Hebei, to petition the municipal government. Mayor Cheng Ke was ill in bed, and Secretary-General Sun Runyu rushed to receive the student representatives on his behalf. The student representatives jointly submitted a petition in the name of the Tianjin Municipal Petition Group of Middle Schools and Above, requesting the authorities for several points: Please forward to the Peiping authorities to speed up the release of arrested students. Please ask Song Zheyuan to abolish the puppet organization. Please ask the Peiping authorities to apologize to the students. Please pay medical expenses for the injured students. Guarantee all patriotic movements of the students. Remove the surveillance military and police from the colleges in Peiping and Tianjin. Sun Runyu replied that the presentation could be forwarded, but Mayor Cheng has been ordered to step down and the new Mayor Xiao has not taken office. Everything is difficult to manage, and I regret that I cannot be responsible for replying. I deeply hope that the students will understand this intention and stop this movement to avoid accidents. The representatives were satisfied and led the crowd to the public gymnasium, dispersing at about 11 am. The leaflets distributed during the parade and the slogans shouted were generally the same as the meaning of the presentation. (18th)</p>

<h3 id="e102">National Economic Commission's Plan to Improve Anhui Tea <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Qimen Tea Farm to Complete Purchase of New Machines for Grading Experiment Next Spring</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The southwestern counties of Anhui Province have traditionally been tea-producing areas. Western Anhui is known for its green tea, while Qimen in southern Anhui is renowned for its black tea. The total annual export volume is seven to eight million dan, with a value of tens of millions of yuan, which is of great importance to the rural economy. In the past, sales to foreign countries were insufficient to meet demand. However, due to poor production methods, in recent years, they have been affected by the competitive sales of tea from Japan, India, and Java. In foreign markets, they have been completely encroached upon. The National Economic Commission believes that improving Anhui tea is an important task for increasing production. It has jointly agreed with the Ministry of Industry, the Anhui Provincial Government, to reorganize the existing tea experiment farm in Qimen. The purpose is to improve Qimen tea through technical research. According to the Anhui Construction Department, the farm is currently managed by the Qimen Office of the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Commission. The internal organization of the office is divided into two sections: General Affairs and Technology. The Technology Section is divided into Tea Improvement Farm, Cooperative Promotion, Trainee, Packaging Improvement, Qimen Hospital, Grading Experiment, and Mechanical Experiment Factory. The various farms and offices have a total of seven or eight rooms, which is a large scale. The newly established Qimen Hospital and Tea Chemistry Laboratory are located in Rao Ci, Raoshanwu, with the tea-making chemistry laboratory adjacent to it. The machinery was recently purchased from Shanghai and transported to Qimen. Workers are already engaged in tea-making and using machinery for grading chemistry experiments to seek progress in production methods. The new farm address on Phoenix Mountain is currently under construction and is expected to be completed in March next year. A winter cooperative tea-making training class has also been opened to recruit tea farmers near Qimen to provide simple training. In addition, one or two trainees from each county of Guichi, Shitai, and Zhizhi are sent to Qimen for training. At the same time, cooperation is promoted, long-term tea loans are made, and a film is produced to be shown in various villages to arouse farmers to unanimously improve tea and increase production.

<h3 id="e103">Tomb of Bian Dashou of the Ming Dynasty Robbed; Losses Exceed One Million <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Treasures All Looted, Scattered Bones, Descendant Bian Ziqing Visits Yutian</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Bian Dashou, a prominent official of the Ming Dynasty, along with Wu Sangui and others, were important figures in the north at the time. After Bian's death, he was buried in Yutian, Hebei. The jewels in his tomb were numerous, comparable to the Eastern Tombs of Malanyu. Since the Eastern Tombs robbery, tombs of value in Hebei have often been robbed. However, Bian Dashou's tomb was carefully protected and only recently was robbed by bandits. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tomb Architecture</p>
<p>Bian Dashou, a prominent official of the Ming Dynasty, along with Zu Dashou, Mao Wenlong, Wu Sangui, Hong Chengchou, and others, were famous figures in the north at the time. Bian served as Minister of Personnel and Grand Secretary in the Ming Dynasty and died in Pingdong at the age of eighty-nine. His descendants multiplied, and his family was wealthy. Many of them served as officials in the early Qing Dynasty. He was buried in the second district of Yutian County, about two li west of Zhang Hongqiao, in the northeast of Dadafeng Village, Hedong. There were more than two hundred tombs of various sizes, with towering steles and ancient cypresses. The tomb was surrounded by walls made of tiger skin stone, marble, and white marble. Successors continued to build it, making it majestic and magnificent, known far and wide, and one of the most valuable historical sites in the history of Pingxi. According to the locals, every tomb in the cemetery contained treasures, comparable in value to the Eastern Tombs of Malanyu. However, due to its solid construction and many tomb keepers, and the local Public Security Bureau repeatedly sending police to protect it, it was difficult for bandits to succeed.</p>
<p>Robbery Process</p>
<p>According to Bian Ziqing, a descendant of Bian, upon returning to Ping, he stated that recently, the police at the cemetery were withdrawn. On the night of the early tenth of this month (6th), at 12:00 p.m., thirty to forty tomb robbers suddenly arrived with pistols, knives, iron picks, lanterns, torches, and ropes. They stormed into the home of the tomb keepers and tied up Shi Youfa, Shi Lianfang, and other father and son, and confined the women, the old and the weak in the Shi family in the house, stuffing their mouths with cloth and cotton. They immediately went to the tomb and began digging, completely digging through Bian Dashou's tomb and three tombs on either side. They dug all night until dawn before finishing the digging and leaving with shouts. After dawn, a passerby heard the voices of people in the yard and entered to release the bound and confined Shis. Shi Youfa and others rushed to Beiping that day to report the incident to me. Upon hearing the news, I went to investigate. Upon arriving at the tomb, I saw the ancestral coffin thrown on the ground, and the bones were scattered everywhere. In addition to quickly sending someone to Ping to prepare a new coffin to be transported to Yutian for reburial, I inspected each tomb according to the family tree. I heard that Bian Dashou's tomb was missing a Ming Dynasty imperial sword called the Azure Dragon Sword, worth 500,000 yuan; a pearl called the Water-Repelling Pearl, worth 300,000 yuan. Besides the one stored in the Forbidden City, whose whereabouts are unknown, there is a town sea bell with a pearl beneath it. In total, there are only three pearls, each about the size of a table tennis ball, that can repel water. In addition, there were dozens of scattered pearls of various sizes in the tomb, worth more than one million yuan in total. All of them have been lost. In addition to submitting a report to the county government, a request has also been submitted to the Hebei provincial government to issue a notice to investigate the bandits and the whereabouts of the treasures.

<p>Fengjing, Chaowu Township: The home of Jin Shangen, a villager in Bao Qi Jia, was suddenly robbed the night before last. The bandits pried open a hole in the wall and entered, threatening the owner with sharp knives. They robbed him of twenty yuan in banknotes, a gold ring, a silver lock, rice, cloth, and other items, and fled with their loot. The villagers have submitted a list of losses and reported the incident to the police for investigation.</p>

<p>Due to the provincial order for reorganization, the business corps in the city and townships of Wu County, except for some branches bordering Taihu Lake and the bustling areas of the city, which continue to be on duty for local security reasons, most branches have been suspended invisibly. Recently, the provincial order allowed them to pass the winter defense period and then reorganize. Therefore, as of the 20th, except for the 3rd, 15th, and 10th departments in the urban area, which have not been on duty for various reasons, all other branches have been on duty. All 18 branches in the township area have been on duty to maintain winter security. The necessary expenses, in addition to subsidies from the County Chamber of Commerce, are still raised locally by each branch.</p>

<p>The Wuxi County Agricultural Warehouse Management Committee held a committee meeting in the county government on the 19th, chaired by County Chief Long. It was resolved that the county's agricultural warehouse, which had been ordered to be established repeatedly, would be set up first in Sitou as the main warehouse and Youjiatan as the branch warehouse, and it would be opened on the 21st. The loan contract will be set at 30,000 yuan for a term of nine months and will be repaid in full. * Dongsheng Yongfeng Pawnshop, which is very close to the Provincial Agricultural Bank's Dongting Warehouse, should follow the county's regulations and unified methods, and no storage and pawn institutions should be added within ten li. The pawnshop has been closed for many years, but this year it suddenly resumed business, which is not conducive to the unified method. The meeting sent a letter to advise it to stop. * All pawnshops, banks, and warehouses that also operate agricultural warehouses should apply for registration. The meeting sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to advise them. Other matters were briefly discussed.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Letter: Letter from the Student Union of Zhejiang University <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Sir, since the crisis in North China and the patriotic movement of students in Beiping on the 9th of this month, our association immediately responded. On the 11th, we united more than 10,000 students from 19 universities and middle schools in Hangzhou City to conduct a grand parade demonstration. However, in the past ten days, all telegrams, declarations, and communications from students in Hangzhou have not been sent out. Regarding what Education Minister Wang said in his speech on the 19th, "If students have opinions on political current events, there are legitimate ways to express them," it is difficult to apply to Hangzhou students. Our association, considering that the situation is getting more difficult and that the Beiping students are bleeding for the patriotic cause, and there is no way to express legitimate opinions, specially instructed someone to bring this letter to Shanghai for publication, so that the patriotic enthusiasm of tens of thousands of young people in Hangzhou and their determination to support the Beiping students can be fully expressed to the people of the country. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Student Union of National Zhejiang University, December 20, 24.</p>

They elected a presidium to lead them. At about 9:00 p.m. that night, they departed from Jiaotong University in a line and followed Zhongshan Road and Shuodian Road. At about 3:00 a.m. yesterday, they arrived at Fudan University. After a short rest, they continued to advance towards the city center, arriving at the city government at around 5:30 a.m. The city government had received the news in advance and sent personnel to take care of them along the way. Considering that the students had been walking for a long distance all night, they prepared bread and tea for the students to eat. Mayor Wu and others arrived at the city government at dawn and personally received the students in front of the stone steps of the city government. When the students saw Mayor Wu, they all applauded and cheered. Mayor Wu expressed his condolences and earnestly persuaded the students to maintain strict discipline and order in the patriotic movement to avoid causing other disputes and increasing the government's difficulties. At the same time, he hoped that the students would not abandon their studies because of the patriotic movement. After listening to Mayor Wu's speech, the students were deeply moved and submitted a written request from the student presidium: * Request the mayor to telegram the central government to stop the North China military and political authorities from suppressing the students' patriotic movement. * Request the government to send troops immediately to suppress the rebel Yin Rugeng. * Request the government to preserve the integrity of the country's territory and sovereignty. * Request the government to implement an active revolutionary diplomacy. * Request the mayor to immediately release Li Zhensheng, a student of Jiaotong University who was arrested. * Request the mayor to protect the patriotic movement in Shanghai. * Request the government to guarantee freedom of speech and assembly. Mayor Wu immediately replied that he would do his best to protect the patriotic movement in Shanghai within the scope of maintaining discipline and order. As for Li Junsheng, he was not arrested. He was taken to the Public Security Bureau for questioning because a letter was found that was suspected of being suspicious. After the questioning, he was released back to the school and it had nothing to do with the patriotic movement. As for the other requests, Mayor Wu promised to forward them to the central government. All the students were satisfied with the reply and dispersed with cheers. It was already about 9:00 a.m. Because it was raining and the road was far, the city government prepared dozens of large group cars to send the students back to school. It was found that the more than 5,000 students who participated in this petition were representatives of major middle and high schools in the city. Students who did not participate continued to attend classes as usual. All representatives of the schools who participated in the petition returned to school and continued to attend classes as usual. All schools in the city did not suspend classes.</p>
<p>Meeting of School Representatives</p>
<p>In order to support the patriotic movement of students in Beiping, all students in Shanghai first gathered at Jinan University at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, together with more than 5,000 students from schools such as Datong, Guanghua, Jiaotong, Chizhi, and Law School, and Nanyang Model Middle School. At 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning, they gathered at Fudan University and convened a temporary meeting of representatives from various schools in the library of the school.

In addition, there were more than 1,000 students from the Chinese Vocational School and hundreds of students from Junyi Middle School.

It happened that Mayor Wu was out, and the first section chief, Li Dachao, received them as a representative. According to the student representatives, the purpose of their petition was exactly the same as that of the petition delegation of the middle schools. Section Chief Li replied that Mayor Wu was now going to a meeting elsewhere and might not be able to come to the government for a while.

<h3 id="e110">Mayor Wu's Letter to All Students in the City <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu yesterday issued a letter to all students in the city, saying: In recent days, thousands of students from major middle and high schools in this city have come to the government to petition because they are worried about the national crisis. We deeply sympathize with the expression of this patriotic spirit, and most of them are disciplined and orderly, and they can still avoid the mistakes of strikes and riots in the past. We are especially gratified. However, because there are many people and the road is long, the representatives of the schools are in the middle of winter, from night to dawn, and they have traveled a long distance. In addition to admiring their patriotic enthusiasm, we are also deeply uneasy. Seeing this phenomenon, Tiecheng is restless in the bedroom, and he is always concerned about the safety and homework of the young students in the city. However, at this time, Tiecheng is for the sake of protecting the youth and for the sake of the youth to whom the life of the nation is tied. There are still things that cannot be said. I would like to express my sincerity and hope to learn from it together.</p>
<p>China is unfortunate to encounter this national crisis, but the arrival of the national crisis is not a matter of one morning and one evening, but a result of the accumulation of historical and global long-term and complex causes. Therefore, saving the country and seeking survival is the most difficult and serious work in the world, and the nation must make efforts on its own, each in its own position, to cultivate the potential of the country's life. What we should learn from the country is not a temporary impulse, not a temporary indignation, but a determination and perseverance to fight and work hard for the country forever.</p>
<p>The central government has already made a prudent decision on the entire diplomatic policy, and the responsible authorities have also repeatedly declared that the government is deeply concerned about the importance of national affairs, the situation in North China, and the necessity of maintaining sovereignty and territory, and is working hard to deal with them. They will never shirk the responsibilities that should be assumed, and they will never give up the rights and interests that should be maintained. However, due to the deep weakness of the nation, it has not been possible to break through this difficult and difficult environment immediately. The people of the country should painfully encourage themselves, swear their sincerity and contribute their strength, and take the spirit of helping each other in the same boat, and vow to be the backing of the government and the country, so that the central authorities can more effectively cope with this dangerous situation.</p>
<p>The city government has forwarded the opinions of the students in this city to the central government. All our young people can only be moved by their hearts, be patient, and maintain a calm spirit and attitude to help the central government cope, and do not take a temporary anger, do not make false and reckless actions, turn the government's energy, and increase the difficulties of the authorities.</p>
<p>Tiecheng loves the country and dares not be behind others. However, there is an undeniable weakness in the patriotic movements of the past, that is, taking the surface for the actual, taking the means for the purpose, so that abandoning the fundamentals and chasing the ends, using energy in vain, not enough to succeed, but more than enough to spoil things. This is the crux of the failure of the national liberation movement over the years, and the reason why China's national spirit is strong on the outside and weak on the inside and cannot help foreign countries, or even be used by a few people with ulterior motives. This is a dangerous step. After Germany's disastrous defeat in 1806, its patriotic philosopher Fichte once frankly warned his people: "Germany's defeat today is caused by the various diseases of the entire German people in peacetime. The future war is a war of character, a war of morality, and a war of knowledge." My enlightened youth in the city, if you forget the precedent of Germany's revival, please remember this philosopher's advice and do not strike, but devote your energy to preparing for the "war of knowledge" with your teeth clenched, to win the final victory for our nation, and to ensure and promote the independent and unshakable life of our nation for thousands of years.

Students from various universities in this city also jointly petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday. Several thousand young people, enduring hunger and cold, spent the night on the streets, yet remained spirited and orderly. This kind of patriotic movement demonstrates utmost sincerity and excites all of us citizens. Now that the various demands raised by the students have been fully accepted by Mayor Wu, and he has agreed to forward them to the Central Government, the petition can be considered concluded. Dear students, henceforth, you should urgently embody the spirit of national salvation through your respective roles, burying yourselves in hard work, preparing your strength, and jointly shouldering the significant task of saving the nation and preserving its existence. We especially hope that the government and its departments will make the greatest determination and have practical plans to fully maintain the integrity of the nation's territory and administration, and will no longer compromise to seek peace, lest the people become disappointed. Then the passionate patriotic sentiments of the youth can be comforted, and traitors and national thieves will have no opportunity to grow secretly. This is what we firmly believe."</p>

<p>Flown to China by Gu Ge and Others</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, after the accident involving aircraft number 5, Eurasia Aviation Corporation increasingly felt that the design and equipment of these aircraft were not suitable. Therefore, they telegraphed Lufthansa in Germany to lease another Junkers-style jumbo aircraft for use. After receiving the telegram, Lufthansa immediately dispatched four individuals: the renowned German pilot Gu Ge, the telegraph operator Qu Luo Si, and the mechanics Bu Er Luo and others. They departed from Berlin yesterday morning and are flying to China. The estimated journey, if uninterrupted, will arrive in Guangzhou on the 27th. By 3 PM on the 28th, they should be able to fly to Longhua Airport. Yesterday, a responsible person from the company told reporters that the design, speed, and safety equipment of the newly leased jumbo aircraft are exactly the same as the two previously leased. After arriving in Shanghai, it will be added to the Shanghai-Xinjiang-Shaanxi-Chengdu route. To express a welcome, the company will send the head of the agency's flight team, Mr. He En, in a small, fast aircraft (number 160) to Guangzhou to guide it to Shanghai.</p>

The telegram stated: (Omitted Salutations) Our association has been collecting winter garments to be transported to various disaster areas to provide relief to the victims, as previously reported by telegram.

It is understood that the Navy's transport ship "Anding" arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 20th) and is docked at the Gaochangmiao Naval Pier. The Relief Association has already sent a letter requesting personnel to board the ship and retrieve the garments today, as the "Anding" is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow and return south.

<h3 id="e129">Ministry of Finance: Affirms That Delivery Notes Should Have Stamps <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Invoices Without Prices Are Exempt</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the request from the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association to exempt three types of goods invoices from stamp duty. The reply stated: Both the telegram and attachments are noted. Upon investigation, when goods are sold and an invoice containing the name, quantity, or price of the goods is issued, it constitutes a sales invoice. The delivery notes used by the pharmaceutical industry, since they contain the name and quantity of the goods and are issued with the goods, even without a price, should still have stamps affixed according to the regulations for sales invoices. Although it is claimed that the notes clearly state "a formal invoice will be provided upon acceptance," implying that another invoice will be issued, it is apparent that there will not be inspection personnel present at every transaction to verify this. Therefore, it cannot be proven. Regarding the delivery notes from Tongmaoyuan and Laiyuan stores that were fined, the word "entered" is already written on the notes, indicating that the goods have been sold. It is reasonable to assume that the business would issue another invoice at the same time as delivering the goods. However, if the purchaser relies on the delivery note for accounting purposes, why not mark "entered" on the invoice containing the price instead of the delivery note, which is only for viewing samples? This clearly indicates that the claim that a separate invoice will be issued after the transaction is a deceptive practice. Furthermore, purchasers have no use for unsold delivery notes and therefore do not need to keep them. If a separate invoice is used for settled transactions, it does not need to be saved. Therefore, since these delivery notes were confiscated, there is no doubt that they are disguised invoices. The request for exemption from stamp duty is denied. As for account statements used for reconciliation, they refer to statements issued to clients at the end of each month or year to verify whether the amounts paid and received are correct. These statements should be limited to those that list the amounts paid and received before the end of the month or year. If the account statements used by the pharmaceutical industry only list the names and quantities of the medicines received and paid, with the dates of receipt and payment clearly indicated, but without the prices, these types of statements can be exempted from stamp duty according to the law. The reason is that when the other party records the medicines, they will definitely be entered into their account books. Therefore, it is not necessary to list them again when issuing the monthly statement for reconciliation. If the price is also listed, it is no different from an invoice for payment as described in item three of the tax schedule and cannot be regarded as an account statement for reconciliation. Please instruct them to comply accordingly. This is the approved reply.</p>

<p>Approved and Registered by the Ministry of Finance; Applying to the Supervisory Committee for a New License</p>

<p>And Requests Earnest Protection for National Porcelain</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Jiangxi Provincial Government yesterday, stating: "To Chairman Xiong of the Jiangxi Provincial Government in Nanchang: According to a report from the local porcelain industry association, the one-year term for the temporary subsidy donation for the extermination of bandits by merchants in Jingdezhen has expired. We have received your government's order to cancel the donation as scheduled and change it to a business tax. Your government's trustworthiness and care for merchants is admired. Upon hearing this news, porcelain merchants are grateful, believing that this is a turning point for the better. Porcelain is a special product of Jiangxi Province. In recent years, it has been severely affected by bandit activities and foreign products, causing business to decline sharply. Without earnest protection, it will be difficult to recover. According to the Business Tax Law passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, business tax is levied on stores, not on forwarding merchants. Some officials in various provinces may not fully understand this point, resulting in a disguised form of transit tax. There have been cases where merchants have petitioned the Ministry of Finance to correct this in accordance with the law. We propose that your government instruct the relevant departments to pay attention to this, so that the export of porcelain products will not be obstructed along the way. We respectfully offer this suggestion in the hope that it will be adopted. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Disguised as a Man When Traveling in Tibet; Narrowly Escaped Disaster in Afghanistan</p>
<p>According to the Continental Report, Mrs. Hamel, a young French woman who is good at writing travelogues and loves to travel and is not afraid of dangers, came to Shanghai on Thursday for a short trip. Mrs. Hamel once traveled from Algeria in North Africa to Dakar. The journey was all in desolate areas, but this weak woman dared to venture out alone, which is admired by everyone. Later, she joined a British exploration team to Tibet. Because Tibetans hate women, she dressed as a man. The team first arrived in Mumbai, and after preparations were completed, they went to Gangtok. After two weeks of traveling, they entered the plateau. The purpose of this trip was to climb Mount Everest. Mrs. Hamel was later forced to return due to illness. After three weeks of traveling, she arrived in Gangtok and received the hospitality of the British political officer and his wife. They would not allow her to leave until she recovered. Mrs. Hamel, because she did not fulfill her desire to travel freely, later went to the border of Afghanistan, where she encountered robbers on the way and narrowly escaped disaster. When she arrived in the capital of Afghanistan, she was received by the Prime Minister, who captured and punished the robbers to show his gratitude. This happened two years ago. Mrs. Hamel started this trip from her hometown in France, passed through the Americas, stayed for two months, and then went to Honolulu and Japan before entering China. Mrs. Hamel has traveled to various countries in Europe. What she has achieved is remarkable. When Mrs. Hamel was hunting in France in previous years, she caught a small bear, raised it, and tamed it. It often followed her around, which those who saw it found strange.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Accused of Deliberately Embezzling Estate Under Management; Xie Lianqing is Sued <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Discovered After Inspecting Accounts; Zhang Wu Sues</p>
<p>The rich merchant from Ningbo, Zhang Yanzhong, who lived in Shanghai, established the Hengchangxiang Machinery Shipbuilding Factory in Hongkou. The business was unusually prosperous. Unfortunately, in September of the Republic of China's 15th year, Zhang Yanzhong suddenly fell ill and died, leaving behind a large estate. Because his only son was young, relatives and friends from the same hometown organized the Zhang Xiarang Estate Management Committee and publicly elected Xie Lianqing as the chairman. He resided in the factory, and all the property was under Xie Lianqing's control. Last year, Zhang's wife, Zhang Wu, discovered that various businesses were facing financial difficulties. She entrusted accountant Huang Bingzhang to audit the accounts. In April of the same year, Xie and others handed over the managed property. It was then that Xie Lianqing's deliberate embezzlement of the estate under management was discovered. Zhang Wu hired lawyers Peng Yuanxun and Xiang Xun to file a private prosecution in the criminal division of the local court, stating that the defendant, Xie Lianqing, had deliberately betrayed his friendship for personal gain. He used his power as manager to sell the five mu, three fen, five li, and four hao of land on East Broadway Road without authorization. According to the accountant's report, there was a discrepancy of 64,266 taels of silver. Furthermore, when the Municipal Council acquired one mu, eight fen, three li, and four hao of land for road expansion, it allocated 66,000 taels of silver as compensation for the land price. This was not recorded in the accounts, and it is unknown who used the money. There were many buildings and houses on the land, with an annual rental income of more than 15,000 yuan. Even if the buildings were demolished and sold as waste materials, there should have been some income. However, after a thorough search of the accounts, there was no record of it at all. How did the defendant dispose of it? After the accountant inquired with the defendant, they refused to answer, causing the plaintiff great losses. To cite just one of the largest amounts, the defendant has clearly committed crimes under Article 342 and Article 335 of the Criminal Law. A request is made to investigate and punish him, so that the evil practice of deceiving orphans and the weak in society can be punished, and a civil lawsuit is also attached. After receiving the complaint, the court held a special hearing in the third courtroom at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Judge Chen Jingyi. The plaintiff, Zhang Wu, and lawyers Peng and Xiang were present in court. The defendant, Xie Lianqing, also hired lawyers Wang Jianhang and others to appear in court to defend him. First, Zhang Wu testified that she was 53 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 2 Tangshan Road. She also recounted the previous events and stated that after her husband died, the defendants organized the Estate Management Committee. Last year, when the factory was reorganized, she refused to sign, and the accountant was hired to audit the accounts and found discrepancies. The defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant was old and appeared in court with illness, and requested permission to be seated. The judge granted permission. The defendant, Xie Lianqing, sat and testified that he was 68 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, and lived at No. 1 Qing'an Lane, Guangqi Road, in Shanghai City. He stated that it was his own property, that he used to be in the money industry, and that he was now retired at home due to old age. He confirmed that after Zhang Yanzhong died, the Estate Management Committee was organized, consisting of seven people, including himself. When asked if there were management regulations, he replied no. When asked if he was in charge of everything and should therefore be responsible, and who sold the land privately, he replied that it was sold by one of the six people, and he did not know. He requested that Yuan be summoned because Yuan was a relative of the plaintiff. The judge obtained this information and stated that the case still required witnesses to be summoned. Lawyer Peng stated that the civil lawsuit in this case was significant and requested that the defendant be detained or provide a guarantee of 100,000 yuan from a reliable shop. The judge then ordered that the defendant not be detained in consideration of his old age and illness, but that a guarantee should be arranged, and instructed the lawyers of both parties to try to settle the civil lawsuit out of court. After the instructions were given, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Data Tung Yuen Shop is Blinded by Profit: Secretly Removing Pure Silver from Silver Cups Exposed. The cup was originally made by Yang Qing He Silver Shop, who informed the cup's owner to report the crime. <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Gu Yuqi, the president of Tongde Medical College, received two commemorative silver cups (marked with Yang Qing He Silver Shop's mark) from a friend many years ago. Because they had become tarnished, on the 10th of this month, he sent a servant to the Data Tung Yuen Shop at 484 Jiujiang Road to have them cleaned and refreshed, agreeing on a price of $2.20. Unexpectedly, the Data Tung Yuen Shop conceived a bad idea. Seeing that the country was implementing the legal tender system and silver was very valuable, they disregarded integrity and were driven by profit. They sent the two silver cups to Zhang Cailin's workshop, Cai Lin Kee, on Guohuo Road, instructing them to remove the silver from the cup centers and replace it with copper, agreeing on a price of $4, intending to deceive Gu. However, Zhang Cailin and his partner Tao Liangbao felt that this kind of behavior would greatly affect their own reputation, and because the silver cups were marked with Yang Qing He's mark, they informed Yang Qing He Silver Shop. The silver shop, believing that Data Tung Yuen Shop's actions of replacing genuine with fake and passing off fish eyes as pearls would have a major impact on their business, notified Gu Yuqi and reported to the silver shop trade union, who in turn reported to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Xu Dezong was dispatched to investigate. It was determined that Huang Yiru, the local owner of the Data Tung Yuen Shop, should bear full responsibility. A request was submitted to the First Special Court, which issued a summons for Huang Yiru to appear in court for questioning. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing in the criminal court. The defendant, Huang Yiru, did not appear, and instead sent lawyer Zhao An to represent him, stating that Huang was currently in Suzhou and requesting a postponement. The victim, Gu Yuqi, also retained lawyer Ding Zheming to appear in court, with a related civil suit. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu presented the case, accusing Huang of fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. Judge Huang, noting the defendant's absence, ordered a postponement of seven days for further review.</p>

<p>The fundraising department of the China Foreign Relief Association at 505 Henan Road, recognizing that winter is approaching and millions of disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold and urgently need relief, is actively raising funds for aid. It has been reported that they have obtained the consent of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai to hold a charity concert at the Grand Theatre on Jingan Temple Road on the 22nd of this month (Sunday) at 10:00 AM. They have also invited music experts from China, Britain, the United States, and Russia to participate. The program includes a speech by Chaplain Wei of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, a joint performance by the military bands of the British and American armed forces, choir performances by the American church, and solo performances by the famous Chinese singer and architect Chen Zhi and the Russian socialite Ms. Luo Fusu. There are many other programs as well, too numerous to list. Gathering famous musicians from China and abroad in one place is truly a grand event in Shanghai. It is reported that no tickets will be sold on the day, but donations will be collected, all of which will be used for disaster relief. This combines disaster relief with entertainment, achieving two goals at once. Benevolent men and women, why not contribute generously?</p>

<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, translated by the Foreign Press, when the President Truman ship was leaving the port the other day, several Chinese customs officers boarded the ship to inspect it and paid particular attention to searching Japanese people for silver. At that time, there were indeed several Japanese people on board who were planning to smuggle silver out of the country. When the customs officers came to check, they were forced to come up with a plan. One of them took out 3,000 silver dollars and threw them onto the Central Wharf. At that time, there were many coolies working on the wharf. When the sound of the silver coins hitting the ground was heard, they scattered like birds and beasts and rushed to grab the silver dollars. Because the silver coins were scattered, it was not easy to gather the coolies together for a while. The customs officers were very surprised to see this situation and assumed that the Japanese had already disposed of the smuggled goods, so they stopped checking and left. But in fact, more than sixty Japanese people on board were carrying huge amounts of silver coins and took advantage of the customs officers' confusion to leave the port safely.</p>

<p>According to the Japanese Mainichi News, at 4:30 PM on the 19th, the police of the Japanese Consulate arrested a 39-year-old Japanese woman. It was found that the woman was from Nishikojima-cho, Nagasaki. She came to Shanghai four years ago and worked as a maid. Since September of last year, she became addicted to heroin and became depraved. In recent years, because she had no money to buy heroin, she broke into the home of a Japanese person at 1000-Ai Li, Siccawei Road, and stole a clock worth 35 yuan from the living room, pawning it for 3 yuan at a Chinese pawnshop on Wusong Road, and selling the pawn ticket for 2 yuan to a restaurant on North Sichuan Road. Other crimes are also being investigated.</p>

<p>Sun Jiean, a new student at the Wusong Merchant Marine School this year, is from Hunan Province. Although his admission credentials included a letter of verification from the provincial education department, when they were sent to the Ministry of Communications for examination, doubts arose. The Ministry of Communications consulted the Ministry of Education, which instructed the Hunan Provincial Education Department to investigate and reply. According to the Hunan Provincial Education Department's response, the credentials were indeed forged. The Ministry of Communications has instructed the Wusong Merchant Marine School that Sun Jiean, as a new student, dared to forge official seals and has committed a crime. In addition to immediately expelling Sun Jiean from the school, he should be transferred to the local court for legal prosecution. The school has complied with the ministry's order.</p>

<p>Shen Weixia, a local woman who works as an elementary school teacher and is 39 years old, recently retained lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a complaint with the criminal court of the District Court against Hu Yunqiao, a former Qing dynasty scholar, accusing him of slander and demanding severe punishment, with a related civil suit seeking 7,200 yuan. The complaint stated that the plaintiff had served as a teacher in public and private elementary schools. On October 26 of this year, the plaintiff and her younger brother received letters from the defendant, Hu Yunqiao, accusing the plaintiff and his son, Hu Youchang, of engaging in improper behavior while working at the Quan He Flour Mill. Reputation is a person's second life, and even more so for a woman. The defendant fabricated facts and arbitrarily slandered the plaintiff, which is a heinous crime. Even if a foster son is not well-behaved, he should bear his own responsibility. Adultery between men and women is frowned upon by society. She requests that the defendant be punished under Article 310 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened a hearing. Both parties failed to appear and instead sent lawyers. First, lawyer Xu presented the plaintiff's case. Next, defendant's lawyer Pan Zhensheng stated that the defendant, Hu Yunqiao, is 82 years old, lives in Chenjiaxing, Pudong, and is an old friend of the plaintiff's father. The letters contained advice but no slanderous statements. Please consider. The judge reviewed the statements and acquitted Hu Yunqiao on the spot, dismissing the civil suit.</p>

<p>Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective at the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and detective Zhang Desheng were searching pedestrians in the Zhegao Road area at 4:15 PM the day before yesterday. They saw three men, Miao Jincai from Kunshan, Guo Jinquan from Tongzhou, and Wang Jinkui, acting suspiciously. They ordered them to stop. Miao immediately ran from Fentian Road and Tangen Road. They and Chinese police officer No. 82 chased after him. Miao, in desperation, fired a shot with his gun. The Chinese police officer also pulled out his gun and fired four shots at him, eventually capturing him. At the time, a stray bullet hit a pedestrian, Chen Guiyang, in the abdomen, and he collapsed. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. The three suspects, Miao, Guo, and Wang, along with a pistol and six bullets, were taken to the police station. Miao's left hand was also wounded by a bullet. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Industrial Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that the group was planning to rob a resident at No. 17, Lane 304, East Jiaxing Road, and requested a postponement for further investigation. Detective Shao then explained the incident and the guns and bullets were inspected. When Miao was questioned, he claimed that the pistol belonged to a fugitive friend named Wang with a lame foot, and he bought it for 30 yuan. The rest of his answers were evasive. Guo Jinquan confessed that Wang with a lame foot invited him from Pudong to rob a family on East Jiaxing Road. They were arrested just as they arrived at the bridgehead. Wang Jinkui confessed that he knew nothing about the robbery and was there to buy cotton. He requested release. Judge Xiao Fengyi ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Youth Lacking Ambition Commits Suicide for Marriage <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Weighing Mount Tai and a Feather, He Should Have Known What Was Important.</p>
<p>How Could He Have Thrown Away Such a Promising Future?</p>
<p>Shi Yanyun, a 61-year-old from Kunshan who resides at No. 6, Lane 68, Medina Road in the French Concession, used to work on a ship and was also the head of the Royal Righteous Society at the City God Temple. He is now retired due to his advanced age. Because he was concerned about his descendants, he adopted a son, Xuejun, early in life, who brought him joy. He is now 18 years old. Xuejun is a handsome young man and is currently studying at the Franco-Chinese School. In order to further his studies, he also studies English at night at an English night school set up by four people in the Zhonghua Building. His parents only had one son and were eager to have a grandson. They had previously hired a matchmaker to arrange a marriage for him, but Xuejun was stubborn and refused his parents' proposed marriage, stating that he wanted to choose his own partner. His parents did not want to go against his wishes and gave up. From then on, during his studies at the night school, he fell in love with a female classmate. The two secretly got engaged on May 27 of this year, stating that they would hold the wedding after Xuejun graduated. His parents found out about this and felt that marriage was not a child's play and that a matchmaker should be formally hired to negotiate. In June, they hired a matchmaker to propose marriage to the girl's parents. The girl's parents said that they would wait until Xuejun graduated and had the ability to support a family before discussing the marriage. Otherwise, they would refuse. Xuejun learned of this and felt that his good intentions had gone wrong and his reputation was ruined. The date of his graduation from school was still far away, and there was no hope for marriage. He had been unhappy for several months. Unexpectedly, he took it a step further and conceived a desire to abandon the world. On the evening of the 18th, after leaving night school, he swallowed poison and committed suicide. He also wrote a farewell letter to his parents and others. When he went to sleep, he told his family that he was tired and would ask the school for leave the next day and told his family not to disturb his sleep. It wasn't until noon the next day that the servant Lu Changsheng woke Xuejun up for lunch and discovered that he was barely breathing. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital, but it was too late. He died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The French Police Station was notified, and the body was taken to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Second Special Court was requested to send Prosecutor Wang Qian and a forensic medical recorder to the funeral home at noon. It was determined that the deceased, Shi Xuejun, had indeed died from taking poison. After questioning the body, permission was granted to prepare the body for burial.</p>

<p>Biological Father Accused of Obstructing Family: Sun Yang Wants Someone, Not Money</p>
<p>Yang Shaochen, a Cantonese man from Shanghai who resides at No. 44 Belle Road in the French Concession and is 49 years old, made his fortune in the opium trade in his early years and accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars. Recently, he switched to running a cotton yarn business. He is now being represented by a lawyer by Sun Yang (41 years old), a Suzhou woman residing at No. 366 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu in the Public Concession, who has filed a complaint with the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing him of obstructing the family and requesting an investigation, with a related civil suit requesting that her daughter Sun Xingzhen (16 years old) be returned to her. According to the complaint, the defendant only values sons and not daughters. In May of the ninth year of the Republic of China, he abandoned his daughter, who was only eleven days old, through an introduction. The plaintiff knew that she could not have children due to illness and had always been concerned about not having any children. When she learned of the situation, she was delighted and asked the defendant to adopt the child as her daughter, issuing a formal adoption certificate. The plaintiff hired lawyer He Fei to sign the document as proof. Since then, she has raised the child as if she were her own, treating her with extreme care and affection. She educated the child and taught her to read, hoping that she would bring honor to the family and be a source of support in her old age. All her hopes rested on her. Who knew that the defendant had ulterior motives and, seven or eight years ago, had the girl come to his house, enticing her with vanity. Fortunately, the plaintiff treated her well, and the love between mother and daughter was not initially tempted by him. In recent years, Xingzhen's knowledge has gradually increased, and she has become literate and knows right from wrong. She told the plaintiff about her biological father's various methods of temptation. Out of gratitude, she cherished the girl even more. She took photos of her every year to commemorate the occasion. The defendant, however, wanted to use the plaintiff's hard work and great sacrifices to raise a child for him. Suddenly, at 8:00 AM on November 16 of this year, the defendant drove his car and took the foster daughter Xingzhen away and hid her. The plaintiff was devastated by the loss of her precious daughter and was beside herself. She first reported the incident to the police station and then went to the defendant's house to inquire, but he claimed that she had not come. Later, she received a notice from the defendant claiming that Xingzhen had turned herself in to the police station on the 16th of last month in search of her biological father. The daughter was now being sent over by Chinese and Western detectives. The plaintiff was heartbroken. She inquired at all the police stations and found that there was no such thing. It was clear that the defendant had lured her away. The plaintiff is not as wealthy as her biological father, but she has enough to eat three meals a day. Crows have a sense of gratitude, and cats and dogs have loyalty to their owners. Humans are not animals, so how can they be so ignorant of conscience and be tempted by vanity? The plaintiff has now learned that she is being hidden in his house. She has sent letters requesting her return, but to no avail. Therefore, she is suing him under Article 240 of the Criminal Law. The court issued a summons for both parties to be interrogated in the criminal court on the morning of yesterday. The plaintiff, Sun Yang, arrived in court with her lawyer and explained the situation, requesting an investigation. She asked that the defendant be ordered to return her daughter. The defendant, Yang Shaochen, stated that his daughter Xingzhen was born to him. Because her "eight characters" were not good and caused conflict, she was adopted by Sun Yang eleven days after birth. On the evening of the 16th of last month, a detective named Guan from the Laozha Police Station came and said, "Why don't you take your daughter back? She is being abused and forced to be a dancer and prostitute. If she is taken care of by me, she should be raised well, not treated as a cash cow." So, I took the daughter back. The girl then testified that her name was Yang Xingzhen, that she was sixteen years old, and that she lived at her father's house at No. 44 Belle Road. She was asked, "You were raised by Sun Yang, weren't you?" She replied, "Yes." She was asked, "Since Sun Yang raised you so well, why did you want to go back to your own home?" She replied, "Because I heard people say that I was going to be a dancer." She was asked, "Did you want to go back to your father's house because Sun Yang is not as rich as your father and you are poor?" She replied, "Because I heard that I was going to be a dancer, I left." The plaintiff then stated that Xingzhen had never been to the police station. She had inquired and found out that it was not true. Moreover, she had reported to the police station after Xingzhen ran away. Her daughter's return was purely instigated by her father, because her father has a car and bodyguards and heartlessly abandoned her sixteen years of upbringing and ran back to her biological father's house to enjoy wealth. The judge said to Ms. Yang, "Why don't you ask her father for some money? Besides, you will need money for your daughter's dowry when she gets married in the future." Ms. Yang replied, "I live for one person, I don't want money. Besides, I am already forty-one years old, and it is too late to have any more children." The court reviewed the statements and ordered that the case be checked with the Laozha Police Station and postponed the hearing until the morning of the 31st.</p>

<p>Savings Dwindled, Lover Found New Love</p>
<p>Yan Meizhen, a 25-year-old woman from Wuxi, went to the Natural Hotel at No. 68 Zhifu Road alone at around 7:00 PM on the 18th of this month, using the alias Huang Meizhen, and rented room number 222. The next morning, Bai Huansheng, a tea boy at the hotel, discovered that Ms. Yan had hanged herself behind the door in her room. He immediately reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, who summoned an ambulance. She was rushed to Guangren Hospital, but it was too late, and she died shortly after. Detective Pang Yutang of the police station was dispatched to investigate. A suicide note was found on the bed in the deceased's room. It stated that she had lost her parents at a young age and had come to Shanghai from her hometown at the age of eighteen. She had worked as a female worker at the Dadong Tobacco Factory and had accumulated more than a hundred dollars in cash. She had met a man named Huang Ziqi and lived with him at No. 2, Chang'an Road, Xinzhazhi. All the money she had accumulated had been spent by Huang, and Huang had suddenly become involved with another woman and had left without returning, making it difficult for the woman to survive. She had no relatives and lacked the care of friends. Therefore, she had resorted to this. The detectives rushed to No. 2 Chang'an Road to investigate. The household there denied it. The body was taken to the Feilun Road autopsy room. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang was dispatched by the First Special District Court to the funeral home to confirm the identity of the body. It was determined that the deceased, Yan Meizhen (alias Huang Meizhen), was female and had indeed died by hanging herself. There were no relatives of the deceased. The body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>Yu Reported to the Police Afterward, Chen Ah Er Arrested and Awaiting Summons</p>
<p>Yu Xiaolian, a native of Shaoxing who lives at 21 Yuezhou Road, went to the Changchun Tea House on Xinbin Road with Zhang Yinxiang, a Ningbo woman who lives next door, to watch a Shaoxing opera at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. A gangster nicknamed "Little Guangdong" spotted them and gathered more than ten people, including Chen Ah Er from Ningbo and "Little Suzhou," to confront Yu and accused them of coaxing virtuous women to watch plays together. They forced them into a room at the Zhongnan Hotel on the road, saying they should not seduce women and demanding $50 as a birthday present. Otherwise, they would chop off their legs with an axe. Yu, in desperation, gave them the money, afraid that if he made a sound, it would be difficult to escape. They sent Little Suzhou to Yuezhou Road to invite Mrs. Xu Shen, the owner of a tobacco and paper store, to mediate. First, they paid $10, which Little Guangdong accepted. They then drafted a note for $40, which Yu Xiaolian and Zhang Yinxiang signed, agreeing to pay it off gradually. Ms. Xu Shen, the owner of the tobacco shop, guaranteed their return and was able to bring them back safely. Yu was unwilling to submit to this and reported the incident to the Hanshan Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Chen Ah Er and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the criminal court of the First Special District Court. Industrial Bureau lawyer Zhang Shizhu presented the case and requested a postponement. Yu Xiaolian, Zhang Yinxiang, and Xu Shen testified about what happened. When the defendant was questioned, he said that Little Guangdong was the mastermind and asked for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered that he be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Cohabitation Agreement Followed by Abandonment: Zhang Ziqing Accused <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Woman Jin Baohua Narrates the Incident, Defendant Claims Agreement Was Signed Under Duress</p>
<p>Jin Baohua, a woman from Zhenjiang who is nearly forty years old, has been drifting around since her divorce. In 1932, she met Zhang Ziqing, a man from Shaoxing, at a game park. Zhang was captivated by her beauty, and they became close. Later, they rented a house together. While their love was still strong, Zhang wrote her a cohabitation agreement, stating that he would never abandon her and would pay alimony if he broke his promise. However, they have recently fallen out of love, and Zhang has stopped visiting the woman. The woman has hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Zhang for abandonment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened a court hearing to summon and interrogate him. According to Jin Baohua's complaint, she met Zhang through Song in May 1932. Zhang then rented a house for them to live together, and Zhang provided all the daily expenses. For four years, they moved several times, eventually settling at No. 66 Hexiang Lane, Xinzha Road. Zhang would return every day. However, on the 18th day of the fifth lunar month, he suddenly left and never came back. She later learned that he was in love with a maid named Abao and had secretly taken his clothes and other belongings away little by little. By the time the clothes were all gone, he had disappeared. But her private savings have also been used up, and she and the two children she brought with her are unable to maintain their lives. When the defendant was questioned, he stated that he used to visit the plaintiff's house when he first met her and gave her 20 yuan every month. In November of last year, they broke up. In November, he was lured back and forced to sign an agreement while drunk. At that time, there were four or five women and two men who threatened him in every way, so he had no choice but to sign the agreement to escape. Judge Feng stated that both parties had rented houses in the Chinese-administered area of the International Settlement and that it was necessary to investigate in detail whether the alleged abandonment occurred in the Chinese-administered area or in the International Settlement. He then ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Battery Trademark Case, Court Hearing Concluded Yesterday, Verdict Next Friday <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Hu Guoguang, owner of the China Battery Factory at No. 3, Yuqing Lane, Dongtangjia Alley, recently produced a kind of battery called the "Shu" brand. He applied for registration with the Trademark Bureau. After the Trademark Bureau examined and approved it, the Hezhong Electric Company believed that the sound of the China Battery Factory's "Shu" brand battery was the same as that of the company's registered "Mingzhu" brand battery. Yu Shu'an, chairman of the company (Chief Engineer of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications), filed an objection. After deliberation by the Trademark Bureau, the objection was declared invalid and rejected. The company then filed a reconsideration, which has not yet been resolved. Yi Yixin, the business manager of Hezhong, filed a complaint with the First Special District Court against Hu Guoguang for fraud. The First Special Court had summoned him once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Qianchang held a hearing in the criminal court. Both parties were present. According to Zhang Yixin's statement, "Mingzhu" and "Shu" have the same pronunciation. In rural areas, people only know the sound and meaning and do not distinguish between the authenticity of the goods. Therefore, it has a significant impact on business and requested that the matter be handled according to law. The defendant's defending lawyer, E Sen, presented various documents from the Trademark Bureau to prove the facts of the case and said that before the administrative agency in charge of trademarks has made a decision, how can it be determined that the defendant's trademark is forged or original? Moreover, the plaintiff's objection has already been rejected. Therefore, this lawsuit is unfounded. It should be noted that the cause of this case is that the plaintiff applied to the Trademark Bureau to register the "Great Linked Beads" brand, which the defendant had been using for a long time, resulting in the Trademark Bureau rejecting the plaintiff's application. Therefore, this case is actually a means of retaliation. The court stated that the facts were clear and ordered the lawyers to begin their arguments. After the lawyers from both sides made their arguments, Judge Yang declared the hearing concluded and set a date for the verdict next Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>Last Night West Qing:</p>
<p>Youyou Fought Hard but Failed</p>
<p>Lost to Pirates 64 to 56</p>
<p>Led for a While in the First Half</p>
<p>West Qing basketball had its only Group A game last night. Youyou played Pirates. Initially thought to be a one-sided affair, the result was surprisingly tense. Youyou lost to Pirates by only eight points, 64 to 56. Notably, Youyou led for a while in the first half, overshadowing Pirates, until two minutes before halftime, when Pirates overtook them with a score of 31 to 30. Youyou unfortunately lost due to lack of stamina.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Mingqiang defeated Jewish (B) 32 to 23 (First half 18 to 11)</p>
<p>Guoguang defeated Shell (B) 37 to 26 (First half 17 to 15)</p>
<p>Pirates defeated Youyou (A) 64 to 56 (First half 31 to 30)</p>
<p>Youyou's Surprise Weapon Emerges</p>
<p>After the game started, in a few rounds, Youyou's Chen Xuechong immediately opened the scoring. Although Shia and Langan returned the favor, the scores were unusually close, with only a one or two-point difference. Zhang Rongcai and Liang Yunming scored consecutively, and Youyou then surpassed with a score of 11 to 10. Running smoothly, they took the lead with a score of 21 to 10, feeling confident and incredibly sharp. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Pirates urgently brought in Bai Nate, gradually catching up from behind, and the two sides grew closer. With Carson's goal, Pirates regained the lead with a score of 31 to 30. The first half then ended quickly.</p>
<p>Stamina Falters, Setback Suffered</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Youyou continued to work hard, but the players gradually showed signs of fatigue in terms of stamina. However, they still fought hard, and the scores were not far behind, differing only by three or four points. Unexpectedly, when the score reached 48 to 41, Youyou's main defender, Sun Huipei, was ejected for committing four fouls, and the hope of victory vanished. However, this did not diminish their fighting spirit, and the final result was 64 to 56, with Youyou losing by only eight points. Youyou's Zhang Rongcai and others were praised for their skillful shooting last night.</p>
<p>First half: Pirates 31 points; Second half: Pirates 33 points</p>
<p>First half: Youyou 30 points; Second half: Youyou 26 points</p>

<p>Zhongti Yueye Championship</p>
<p>Team and Individual Titles Both Go to Fushi</p>
<p>Zhu Wenzhang Finishes Full Course First at 14 Minutes 10 Seconds</p>
<p>Minli Temporarily Absent; Actually Only Three Schools Competed</p>
<p>The cross-country race organized by the Zhongxiao Sports Federation was held yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM in drizzling rain. The entire course was 3,000 meters, with the starting and ending points both at the front of Fuzhong on Haig Road. A total of four schools, including Guanghua, Minli, Xunshi, and Fuzhong, registered for this year's event. Minli temporarily withdrew, and only three schools actually participated, with 26 athletes. As a result, Fushi won the championship with 46 points, Guanghua finished second with 54 points, and the third place went to Fuzhong. Zhu Wenzhang of Fushi also won the individual championship, achieving a time of 14 minutes and 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Zhu Wenzhang Emerges</p>
<p>At around 2:00 PM, 52 fast runners gathered in front of Fuzhong on Haig Road, and the race started at 2:30 PM, with Chen Bingde leading the way on a motorcycle. When passing Yidingpan Road, the racers gradually separated, with Zhu Wenzhang of Houshi spreading out his strides and emerging ahead. Wang Shijing of Guanghua followed closely. By the time they turned onto Baisai Zhong Road, they had already formed a long line. Due to the rain and slippery ground, the racers were extra careful. After crossing Zhu Erdian Road, half of the entire course had been covered. At the intersection of Fukaissen Road, Zhu Wenzhang was still leading the way, quickening his pace. Wang Shijing remained in second place, followed by Zheng of Fushi and Gao of Fuzhong, with the other racers not far behind. At this point, eight-tenths of the entire course had been covered, and all the leading racers were full of ambition. By the time they reached the intersection of Qiaoden Road and turned north onto Haig Road, the finish line was in sight. Zhu Wenzhang dashed forward like an arrow, breaking through and taking the lead, with a time of 14 minutes and 10 seconds. The second place went to Zheng Zhen of Fusai, and the third place went to Wang Shijing of Guanghua, with only a few steps separating them.</p>
<p>Fushi First in Team Event</p>
<p>After the race, Lu Xiangqian, Jiang Jingnan, Chen Bingde, and Han Kuiyong calculated the scores, taking the top six racers from each school. Fushi Zhongxiao won the championship with 46 points. Guanghua Middle School finished second with 54 points, and Fudan Middle School finished third with 73 points. It is a pity that Guanghua lost by eight points due to the absence of their strong athlete Zhang Heling. The results are as follows: 1. Zhu Wenzhang (Fushi); 2. Zheng Zhen (Fusai); 3. Wang Shijing (Guanghua); 4. Gao Jinfu (Fuzhong); 5. Chen Chongxian (Fuzhong); 6. Wen Yeping (Fushi); 7. Zhang Delin (Guanghua); 8. Zheng Shilu (Fusai); 9. Deng Tingkun (Guanghua); 10.

<p>Among the four final games of the Shanghai Basketball Association last night, the match between the Yidui Jingwu's B team was the most interesting.

At the final whistle, the score was tied at 21 to 21.

<p>Education News</p>
<p>Recent Education Situation in Guizhou Province</p>
<p>The estimated educational expenditure budget for Guizhou Province in the 24th year of the Republic is set at a total of 749,101.60 yuan, including expenses for the Department of Education, educational funds, special education for ethnic minorities, and expenses for the Tongzhi Museum and other cultural activities, accounting for 10.66% of the total provincial expenditure (7,029,468.84 yuan). The province has 36 secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools, including 10 provincial-level secondary schools (one for girls), 12 county-level secondary schools (three junior high schools for girls), 2 joint schools, and 5 private schools. There are 2 provincial-level normal schools (one for girls) and 4 county-level vocational schools. These schools have 1,629 students in senior high school (1,197 boys and 432 girls) and 7,491 students in junior high school (6,026 boys and 1,465 girls), totaling 9,120 students in both senior and junior high school. In addition, the province has one county-level girls' junior high school in Chishui County, which has not yet reported due to bandit activity this spring. There are also one boys' secondary school each in Meitan and Bijie and one girls' secondary school each in Qianxi and Dushan, which have not been approved by the Department of Education and are not included. Regarding vocational education, since the provincial-level vocational school was closed in 1927, only agricultural, industrial, and commercial courses have been offered within provincial-level senior high schools. In 1935, a provincial-level Guiyang junior vocational school was established with an opening budget of 25,000 yuan and a recurring expense of over 14,000 yuan. The three county-level secondary schools in Dading, Du, and Tianzhu Counties were renamed vocational schools and began recruiting junior vocational class students, with the province subsidizing each class 800 yuan annually. The total vocational education expenditure is 41,810.80 yuan, which is less than one-tenth of the allocated funding for secondary education (450,743.60 yuan). Although this does not meet the standards set by the Ministry of Education, it is a significant achievement considering that the province's vocational education has no foundation and is just beginning. The provincial authorities plan to gradually increase funding in the future.</p>

<p>Opinions of Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Principals on Visiting Education in North China</p>
<p>In order to encourage educational administrators in Jiangsu Province to improve their qualifications and to seek improvements in education in the province, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has established regulations for educational administrators to visit education domestically and abroad. The department recently sent eight principals from the province to visit educational institutions in North China, including Zheng Xigu from Shangzhong, Peng Qinming from Changzhong, Liu Hengjing from Nanjing Girls' High School, Jiang Long from Private Girls' High School, Huang Dunfu from Qiling Xiang Teachers' School, Cao Yihua from Hai Teachers' School, Jin Shiru from Xu Girls' Teachers' School, and Zhang Yaomo from Suqian Vocational School. They traveled north from Nanjing on November 16, passing through cities and provinces such as Feng, Anji, Jinan, Doping, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Boye, Ding County, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Xuzhou. They returned to Nanjing yesterday. A reporter interviewed Zheng Xigu, Huang Dunfu, and Liu Hengjing, representatives of the visiting group, inquiring about their experiences and materials collected during their visit to nine provinces and cities in North China, which lasted one month and two days. They stated that they had gained much from their personal development and that they had seen much that could be learned for the improvement of education in Jiangsu Province. The colleagues summarized their observations as follows:</p>
<p>A. What impressed them most after the visit:</p>
<p>The municipal construction of Qingdao City has made rapid progress in recent years, achieving astonishing results. Mayor Shen and the heads of various bureaus have shown determination, and all civil servants are full of vitality, diligently performing their duties and taking responsibility for their tasks. All municipal and rural construction projects, including education, highways, sanitation, public housing, beggar reformatories, and drug rehabilitation centers, have been planned and implemented appropriately. This is unparalleled by any other city in China and rare even in Europe and the United States. The visitors were deeply impressed and felt that the affairs of China are not difficult to manage and that the Chinese people are capable if they are willing to work diligently for the public good. Qingdao City can serve as a practical example.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Tongxuan's establishment of the Sizhong Middle School in Boye County, Hebei Province, and his training of the local population in three nearby counties demonstrate an indestructible spirit and achievement. Mr. Zhang, a former army commander and commander-in-chief, is now a member of the Hebei Provincial Government and is able to endure hardship, lead by example, and live with the youth and the people, training them personally using a combination of education and hygiene methods. This has reversed the demoralized atmosphere in the general education sector. His spirit of perseverance and determination is truly admirable.</p>
<p>The Northwest Industrial Company in Taiyuan is a large-scale enterprise with more than 20 large factories, such as textile, paper, machine, flour, cigarette, and chemical plants. The equipment costs for each factory are mostly over a million yuan. A copper smelting plant is currently under construction. The products of all the factories are comparable to foreign goods in quality but are priced lower. The province's people are self-sufficient in their daily necessities. This spirit of hard work is truly inspiring.</p>
<p>B. Aspects of education in various regions that are worthy of learning:</p>
<p>Students in middle schools in various provinces and cities in northern China have simple lives and strong physiques. Their spirit of hard work and endurance is worthy of emulation by the youth in the south. The school buildings and facilities in Qingdao's municipal and rural primary and secondary schools are well-equipped, military training is strict, and the methods of popularizing civil education and compulsory education are worthy of Jiangsu Province's reference. The school buildings in the Pingjin Hebei area are large in scale and well-equipped, such as Nankai Middle School, Tianjin Normal School, Ping City Normal School, and Hebei Provincial High School, which are mostly unmatched by Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Compulsory education in Shanxi Province has been implemented for many years, and its coverage has reached 80%. In the remote border areas of Chahar Province, the land is barren, and the people are poor, but the administrative staff of each school are diligent and responsible. Their hard work is commendable. The prosperity of the nation depends on healthy youth, but the development of healthy youth depends on those who have the responsibility of leading and training youth first possessing national consciousness, patriotic ideas, hard work, leading by example, and living with the youth. Only then will it be effective. After our visit to education in various regions, we found that, with the exception of a very small number of schools and a very small number of teachers, the vast majority are teaching only, not only failing to live with the students but also not asking about or caring about the students' behavior and how to be a person. If those with the responsibility of education and teachers maintain this attitude, can we train youth who are capable of saving the nation and surviving? This is an extremely important issue.</p>
<p>The above two issues are the most important and most difficult to solve that we felt after our visit. We would like to publicly raise them for our colleagues in the education sector to discuss together. Finally, we are very grateful for the warm reception and guidance from our colleagues in the education sector in various regions during this visit.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel: Little Men (130), Translated by Zheng Xiaocang, Original by Louisa M. Alcott</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Rob will be perfectly fine, but Nan has a headache and her face is covered with cold pain relief cream, lying on Mother Bhaer's sofa. She no longer feels regret now and clearly thinks that getting lost is a good game. Mrs. Jo naturally feels unhappy seeing this situation. Therefore, she speaks seriously to Nan, wanting to make her understand the difference between freedom and indulgence, and at the same time tells several stories to deepen the effectiveness of her lecture. She hasn't decided how to punish Nan, but when she gets to a certain story, she thinks of a method, and because Mrs. Jo likes strange punishments, she decides to try it.</p>
<p>"All children have run away," Nan defends herself, as if it's like measles and whooping cough, very natural and inevitable.</p>
<p>"Not all are like that, and some who run away are never found again," Mrs. Jo replies.</p>
<p>"Haven't you ever gotten lost?" Nan asks, her sharp eyes able to recognize some traces of the same adventurous spirit in the woman across from her, who is somber and stitching non-stop.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jo smiles, admitting that she has.</p>
<p>"Tell me about it," Nan requests, thinking that she has gained the upper hand in this conversation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jo has seen this, immediately shakes her head, indicating that she still regrets it, and then says solemnly: "I had several times, this naughtiness made my poor mother suffer a lot, until finally she cured my problem."</p>
<p>"How?" Nan suddenly sits up, her face full of interest.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Reflections (Rong Yu)</p>
<p>"Watching others carry a burden, one doesn't feel the effort," this is a common habit. People criticize officials for being incompetent and scold bosses for being idiots, but only when they become officials or bosses themselves do they realize the inappropriateness of their previous criticisms.</p>
<p>"One's own writing is the best," hence the many literary battles in the literary world; "Another man's wife is the best," hence the many adulterous affairs in society. If we could change these around, "Another man's writing is the best," then humble gentlemen would dedicate themselves to careful study; "One's own wife is the best," then the couple would live in harmony and there would be no divorces.</p>
<p>It is a good thing for a young person to be mature, but if that maturity leads to constant retreat and never advancing, the difference from a "mummy" is minimal.</p>
<p>Once Chinese people pass the age of sixty, they think of enjoying rural life, leaving national affairs to those who come after them. This truly commits the sin of "premature aging." In the political arena of foreign countries, there are many elderly men in their seventies who are active and vigorous, truly deserving of the saying "vigorous in old age."</p>

<h3 id="e157">Radio Stations Broadcast Gramophone Records Freely Without Interference; Gramophone Records are Not Publications and Have No Exclusive Performance Rights; Directorate General of Telecommunications Informs Broadcasting Industry of Rejection <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Foreign record companies in this city, using the excuse of copyright for their produced records, demanded that various broadcasting radio stations pay performance fees, which caused a great dispute that has not yet been resolved. According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter, after this incident occurred, the International Telecommunications Bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and requested an interpretation from the Judicial Yuan. The bureau has now received Directive No. 17731 from the Ministry of Communications, stating that regarding whether broadcasting radio stations broadcasting gramophone records involves copyright or the Publication Law, after this Ministry requested the Judicial Yuan for interpretation, the reply from the Yuan is as follows: "The Yuan received your Ministry's public letter dated July 8, roughly stating that broadcasting radio stations broadcasting gramophone records involves copyright law or the Publication Law, and requesting an interpretation. This matter has been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of this Yuan. Gramophone records are neither publications nor copyrighted works and have no exclusive right to public performance. Purchasers exercise their ownership rights and are free to use them in any way, whether for personal entertainment or public listening. Sellers, manufacturers, and publishers may not interfere." Based on this, since the Judicial Yuan's Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference has ruled that gramophone records are neither publications nor copyrighted works and have no exclusive right to public performance, all foreign record companies demanding performance fees from the broadcasting radio stations should be rejected. The bureau, after receiving the order, has informed the broadcasting industry association of the rejection.</p>

<p>I. The Beginning of Domestic Pencils II. Raw Materials for Pencil Manufacturing III. Key Points of Pencil Manufacturing IV. Pencil Lead Manufacturing Process V. Pencil Shaft Manufacturing Process VI. Mechanical Equipment VII. Other Products VIII. Brief History of the China Pencil Factory</p>
<p>(I) The Beginning of Domestic Pencils</p>
<p>A small pencil, its structure is just a round piece of wood, embedded with a thin piece of lead. One always thought the manufacturing process would not be too complicated. But if you have the opportunity to visit a pencil factory (such as the China Pencil Factory at 1176 Xiexu Road, Shanghai), you will definitely be secretly amazed and say, "I didn't expect the manufacture of pencils to be so difficult," and naturally believe in the value of resources.</p>
<p>Pencils were invented in England in 1565 AD; and the most famous pencil factory is the A.W.Fale factory in Germany. We often see the word Bavaria branded on pencils, which is produced in Bavaria, southern Germany, because the raw materials for making pencils are quite abundant there, and wages are cheap, so there are many pencil factories, and their products can be sold to countries all over the world. As for Japan, our eastern neighbor, although it has only been manufacturing pencils for more than twenty years, it is also able to sell well to countries with backward industries because of its low labor costs and lighter costs, and the number transported to our country for sale is huge.</p>
<p>The pencil seems to be a trivial item, but it is actually a necessary stationery item for primary school students today, occupying an important place in educational supplies. With so many school-age children in China, the number of pencils used is impossible to estimate. But according to last year's customs trade report, the number of pencils imported into our country has reached 1.5 million gold units. As the literacy movement is rapidly advancing and universal education is striving to be implemented, the degree of need will inevitably increase accordingly. If we still have to rely on foreign supplies, the outflow of rights and interests is unbearable to imagine. Fortunately, in recent years, the pencil manufacturing industry in China has begun. The Jiulong Pencil Factory was established earlier, and the China Pencil Factory in Shanghai has risen later. Because manufacturing pencils is still a new industry in our country, I visited the China Pencil Factory nearby. I was warmly received by Mr. Wu Qingmei, the director of the factory, who carefully explained to me. Only then did I know that the process of manufacturing pencils is not as simple as people imagine, and the quality of pencil products depends entirely on whether the work is conscientious or not. Moreover, the materials used by the factory are all domestic products of our country, which is completely domestic goods, which is especially commendable. Therefore, I am happy to record what I saw during the visit and introduce it to the people of the country.</p>
<p>Clay washing</p>
<p>(II) Raw Materials for Pencil Manufacturing</p>
<p>When pencils first arrived in China, people named them pencils because the material of the pencil lead was like lead. Later, people misunderstood, thinking that pencils were made of lead (maybe some people still misunderstand now). The actual raw material for making pencil leads is carbonaceous graphite, also known as black lead (Graphite), which is produced in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Hunan, Fujian, and Jiangsu provinces in our country. Natural products contain soil or other impurities. High-quality graphite, such as the earthy graphite from Tianzhen, Shanxi, has a content of 85%, and the graphite produced in Xianqing, Hunan, is also above 80%. The best is the scaly graphite near the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi, with a content as high as 94%.</p>
<p>In addition to pencil lead, the raw material for pencil leads is clay (Clay). The clay must be very fine and not mixed with sand particles, so that it can be mixed with pencil lead evenly. This is produced in large quantities in the Jiangnan area of our country, so there is no need to worry about shortage, but it needs to be washed, precipitated, and filtered.</p>
<p>The wood used for the pencil shell is the most important raw material. High-grade products such as Pencil Cedar and Incense Cedar are mostly produced in the United States, and the northeastern provinces of our country also produce them. But ordinary evergreen trees such as pine, fir, linden, yew, poplar, juniper, and ginkgo can also be used. The China Pencil Factory often purchases various types of wood from various parts of the country and tests them in order to select the best quality for large-scale use. The ones currently used are mostly linden and pine and fir.</p>
<p>(III) Key Points of Pencil Manufacturing</p>
<p>Manufacturing pencils is very simple in principle: mix graphite and clay to form a pencil lead, and make the wood into a pencil shaft, put in the pencil lead, and the pencil is made. But in fact, to seek excellent products while also seeking rapid work, it is necessary to have considerable machine equipment and skilled manual technology. I think readers must have had experience with inferior pencils. Now let's just list a few defects and talk about them casually. For example, when you use a pencil to write, it suddenly becomes hard and unclear. That's because the pencil lead is not fine enough, the clay is not purified, or the mixing is not even and not very strong. Another example is that the pencil lead is easy to separate from the pencil shaft. That's because the pencil lead is too thin, or the wood used is not dry enough or straight enough when it is manufactured. Sometimes one half of the pencil shaft is very soft, while the other half is very hard. This is because the wood is not selected and matched properly. Other problems such as pencil lead being easily broken and the pencil shaft being difficult to sharpen are all due to improper material matching and sloppy manufacturing work. Therefore, to make high-quality pencils, one must go through a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>(IV) Pencil Lead Manufacturing Process</p>
<p>The China Pencil Factory has equipment for washing and precipitating clay raw materials. First, the clay that is transported is washed, and then it flows through several filter cylinders to gradually precipitate the sand particles. The pure clay, which is light and fine, is then filtered on a filter press to remove the water and become mud-like clay, which is then placed on a mill and finely ground for two days using electricity before it is used. Therefore, the clay itself is extremely fine. This is the work of the clay washing and grinding department.</p>
<p>The pencil lead used by the China Pencil Factory is purchased from a stone crushing factory, and it has already been crushed into fine powder, but it is still not fine enough. Therefore, after mixing it with clay, it must be finely ground in a mixing mill for half a day before it is taken out and steamed dry. Then it is moved to the pencil lead kneading mortar, which is also driven by electricity. After a considerable period of pounding, the pencil lead begins to have adhesion, and then it is sent to the pencil lead rolling machine. The machine rolls the block of pencil lead into pieces of flakes. The rolling must be done more than twenty times before the pencil lead is fine enough. But because the texture is still loose, it must be compacted again. At this time, the pencil lead has become a black soft block. Then it is sent to the pencil rod pressing machine, which presses out a pencil rod about the thickness of a finger, and it is cut into small sections as it is pressed. Then, in the same way, the coarse pencil rod is pressed out to form the pencil lead, which is the general thickness and length of the pencil lead that is used.</p>
<p>The pencil lead made in this way is soft, so after it is bundled and dried once, it is gradually heated to a high temperature of 900 degrees in the furnace to remove moisture and harden it, and then it is steamed with oil. When it cools down, the pencil lead can be used. This is the pencil lead manufacturing process. (To be continued)</p>

<p>I did not practice small regular script when I was young. However, in the past, the imperial examinations in the palace halls placed great emphasis on calligraphy. In the 30th year of Daoguang, I became a Jinshi. In the Baohe Hall examination, I was ranked first. Everyone was suspicious. Later, I learned that it was because of Duke Xiangxiang. Xiangxiang obtained my paper and greatly appreciated its writing. He told Du Wenzheng that he must place me first. The officials gathered to watch. The emperor said, "The writing is good, but how could it be done so quickly? It must be a copied old text." Xiangxiang said, "No, his poetry is also consistent. Could the poetry also be old?" The discussion was settled. Therefore, I was able to enter the Hanlin Academy. Recalling the origin of my fame, I dare not forget it at every meal.</p>

<p>The "Oriental Mae West?" of "Begonia Red" has been "politely declined" by the Star Film Company. The reason for the rejection, it is said, is to rush the production of four new films, all to be completed within the year; in fact, this is only one-third of the reason. Another third is due to unfavorable public opinion, and the final third is reportedly due to issues with the compensation.</p>
<p>According to reports, the so-called "Oriental Female Douglas Fairbanks," Wu Lizhu, will inaugurate the Nanyang Dance Hall today. (I remember that the inaugurator of a friend's dance hall in the past was also this woman.) In addition to the grand title of "Oriental Female Douglas Fairbanks," it seems that she can also add the title of "Small Dance Hall Inauguration Star."</p>
<p>At the end of 1935, Yao Zi made an "interpretation" of "1935 is Tan Ying's Year" in the Film Times. Some say that in order to avoid "193X is Tan Ying's Year" becoming just a slogan, it seems that a boss should invest in a play directed by Yao Zi and starring Tan Ying. In this way, it is believed that Tan Ying's acting genius can definitely be developed, and the box office will certainly not be bad. (Zi said: It would be even better if Cheng Bugao cooperated or co-starred).</p>

At first, she is deeply in love with a famous male actor, but later a street singer wins the beauty's favor with his beautiful voice, leading to a happy marriage.

<p>This Year's Masterpiece of Extreme Sadness</p>
<p>"Dreams Shattered, Souls Lost" (Peter Ibbetson), opening today at the Grand Theatre, is an extremely tragic literary film. Paramount's executives, because previous literary films like "Little Lord Fauntleroy" and "Little Women" have achieved great success, specially adapted this immortal masterpiece by the 19th-century British literary giant George du Maurier to the screen, and specially invited Gary Cooper and Ann Harding to play the leading roles in the film. In terms of performance, it is indeed extremely sad and moving, achieving great success. The film tells the story of a pair of lovers who are separated, but their love does not diminish, and they entrust half of their lives to the memories of their dreams. This is indeed a good work that movie fans cannot miss.</p>

<h3 id="e177">"Go to the Countryside" Mr. Wang Carries the Sedan, Little Chen Sits <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang's comics have long been household names, and Mr. Wang's appearance on the screen is even more popular. Mr. Wang's portraits are everywhere in the streets and alleys. Mr. Wang has become a prominent figure in the market, the only advertising material for commodities. But this time, Mr. Wang went to the countryside. He threw away his top hat, suit, gown, and mandarin jacket, put on tattered coarse cloth clothes, and became a thoroughbred country bumpkin, leading his fat wife and daughter A Yuan to farm in the countryside. Like other petty citizens, he was affected by the wave of the world economic collapse and went bankrupt. Mr. Wang is extraordinary after all. He has the courage to be a human being. In addition to working hard in rural affairs, he also helps people carry sedan chairs to earn some "extra money" to make a few floral clothes for his little A Yuan. But he was heartbroken, Mr. Wang carried the sedan for the first time and smashed his good friend Little Chen, who had become an official. In order to curry favor with his friend, he resolutely carried the sedan for Little Chen. Because Little Chen was fat, when passing over a small bridge, Mr. Wang finally had his legs shaking due to his thin body and lack of strength. The look was a bit embarrassing. In this day and age, it's a bit "that way" for a good friend to carry a sedan for another friend to sit in.</p>
