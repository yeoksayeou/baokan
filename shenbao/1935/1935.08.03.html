<p>— 綸</p>
<p>中國各公司股票。向無公開之行市。及流通之機關。有之。亦維如曇花一現。終歸於有行無市。於是求者難求。售者難售。公司投資所以不踴躍。公司發展所以不容易。此亦其一因。夷考其故。固爲一般人士對於公司事業缺乏深切之認識。但興業數十年。中國實業之能卓著成效者有幾。卽號稱大實業者。亦住往經營不善。一究內容。則蕪雜凌亂。散漫無序。其空虛殊不堪問。至於因天賜之倖運。獲一時之興盛。而難於持久。終歸失敗者尤比此皆是。此欲引起一般對於公司投資之信用。不亦南轅而北轍。就另一方面而言。公司間亦有經營得宜者。設欲購其股票。常出以高於票商之價。而不可得。反之。欲出售亦無受主。蓋股票如有公開行市。則其市價。常視其營業之情况而變遷甚速。在公司事業尙未踏上軌道之前。股票行市之轉變。常易引致公司意外之不利。公司股票之不爲公開買賣。要亦有其不得已之情形在焉。</p>
<p>公司股票之處境已如是。請再就公司債言之。公司價之募集。不外兩種動機。一爲興游新事業。增資恐增永久之負担。不得不募債以應一時之周轉。一爲缺乏資金。添股爲難。不得已而出於募債之一途。公司債用途如何。姑置不論。要之。皆以其財產爲本息之担保。茍一般對其財產有深切之信任。則增資添股易。募債亦易。若無此信任。債亦無從募起。公司債之募集。雖有不崇朝而竣事者。但其地位不同。營業自有其優長。乃能得入之循任也。</p>
<p>自金融業一度發生事故。有存欵若亦深爲焦急。埋藏則無利。投資則無門。於是激進者趨於投機。穩健者鑒於年來各債本息之如期支付。出其所存。以購債劵。因之各業蕭條。惟證券市塲獨繁盛。劵價雖有時而疲。終必崛然以起。此無他。能保持其信用。得人之信任也。且倩券之担保爲關稅而關稅。又爲一般認爲最可靠之担保品。假如各債本息之担保。非爲關稅。爲股票一類之有價證券。而又種類繁多。恐難同樣得人之信任矣。</p>
<p>就各種數字一加觀察。銀底缺乏。自係事實。然如不圖挽救。則不但缺乏。終且有窮盡之一日。從另一方面以觀。中國遊資。正患無安身之所。甚至流入外國銀庫。藏身於海外者亦多。使此種遊資能運用於工商業。存置淤本國銀庫之內。其裨益於工商業者必大。然如何能使之不逃避。可爲吾用。此則在乎欲利用之者自己之努力努力。之道亦不難。要在去其隱秘之私心。而爲業務內容之公開。以求得人之信任耳。然今則一般尙不能以其眞實狀况公諸世。欲謀救濟方案之自出。勢不得不賴於翔實之調查。精密之審核。此卽所謂不得巳而求其次也。成以商戰之世。戰不厭詐。不知經商究非行軍可比。行軍之言詐。虛則實之。實則虛之。示人以不可測。而工商業除技術上應有時嚴守秘密外。業務上可以公開者理宜虛虛實實。俾大衆有審量之餘地。久之而其信用自堅。竊以爲今日之最大改革。莫如去其爲己。而盡其在己。躬自厚而薄責於人。事業庶有轉機之望歟。</p>

<p>遇匪當時</p>
<p>予（密勒自稱）與瓊斯君、約於上月二十七日上午十時、乘汽車自多倫啟程往張家口、經黃旗大營·哈叭咖·在一沙漠地方、汽車突然發生障礙、當夜卽在該處過宿、詰朝、車脫險後、繼續前進、午刻至官馬溝地方之何家大火房村、汽車尙未山村、突有穿藍色制服（與保安隊之制服相埒）之匪衆約三四十名、自兩旁竄出、放射步槍及機槍數十發、予等所乘汽車之水箱、當中兩彈、遂被迫停止、</p>
<p>沒收財物</p>
<p>予（密勒自稱）卽自汽車中跳出、請問彼等何事開槍、阻予等前進、匪答稱、我們是剿匪的保安隊、旋邀予進一小屋啜茗、是時、予瞥見匪等搬取予之行李進屋、詰其何故、據稱、照例的檢查、其中有一匪、卽將予之銀錢、入其衣囊、予憤詢擅取人財、亦爲檢查耶、匪笑稱、予等是土匪也、並不是保安隊、君旣來之、則請安之、匪等繼將車中之英記者瓊斯君、架入另一小屋、用繩縛懸樑上、未幾、復架渠至予室、似將作談判然、</p>
<p>四項要求</p>
<p>是時、室之四周、滿站匪崗、端槍作預備放式、形勢之嚴重、無以復加、在此種局勢之下、匪方提出、（一）贖欵十萬元、（二）步槍四十枝、子彈兩萬發、（三）手槍二十枝、子彈二萬發、（四）手提機槍二十支、子彈二萬發、此四項要求、不待商酌、卽以書面要予等簽字、限十日內辦到、否則撕票、該字條卽交汽車夫俄人比得利雪夫·與予之僕人梁某、於下午三時餘、由官馬溝出發、逕往寶昌縣、車夫等旣到目的地、卽用電話報告張家口車夫之戚某、轉達北平英大使館、德公使館、寶昌縣長、亦將予等被擄事件、急電省府報告、</p>
<p>匪窟生活</p>
<p>直至二十九日晚、英德大使館等接張垣電話後、卽派員於三十日上午六時離平、下午二時抵張垣、辦理營敘事項、予等陷身匪窟、所得待遇尙佳、故精神上未受重大刺激、惟瓊斯因初次遭遇、不無恐懼、而予則殊認爲生平最有興趣之事件、蓋匪窟生活、自有其洞天也、當二十八日車夫及梁某離官馬溝南行以後、予與瓊斯、卽於匪人脅迫之下、雙手反覆、騎馬北行、輾轉多處、可知匪人之地理、亦不熟悉、蓋左繞右轉、仍未離寶昌縣境也、至二十九日最後移至葉木旗、予等雖隨彼等亂移、飲食幸尙不虧、</p>
<p>營救情形</p>
<p>是日、卽有保安隊排長張雲吉·偕警察三人前來交涉、土匪先向張放槍、張以白手巾表示無抵抗、土匪卽派人與張談話、張復取出隊部函件、以爲徵信、詎匪目不識丁、竟將該函撕成粉碎、並將張等三人縛持、然後帶至匪首處、匪首姓紀或季未確聞、張首先要求將予等釋放、匪首因見張勇敢精練、自動表示讓步、减爲贖似五萬元、其他一槪免去、</p>
<p>脫險經過</p>
<p>三十日、行至科泰爾地方、予與瓊斯共食後、匪卽將予等分開、予一行共六騎（內有保安隊排長張雲吉及警察三名、引導二人、）予初以爲凶多吉少、或係將予槍斃者、未料竟安然到達寶昌縣城、綠張與匪商洽結果、先將予假釋放、以便與各方辦理贖票事宣、而匪首亦曾稱、政府如允彼等改邪歸正、願受招撫、予係於三十日午抵寶昌、三十一日下午四時乘汽車回抵張家口與察省府負責人蕭振瀛·曁英大使館所派武官米樂君會晤、商談營救瓊斯君辦法、蕭君表示甚佳、允必用種種秀屈求全辦法、使瓊斯安然歸來、</p>
<p>瓊斯安全</p>
<p>關於瓊斯君之安全問題、在限期以前、如能營救得法、當不致可慮、頃據非正式消息、謂瓊斯有已脫險說、經向各方探訽、尙未能證實、但願外傳係確、則不勝馨香祝禱者也、假定瓊斯仍在匪窟、予則擬於明日（二日）赴張垣、協同進行營救難友、萬一仍無辦法、則予卽轉往寶昌、仍返匪窟與瓊斯共生死、以全道義之交、中國政府對予等此次事件、熱誠援助、私衷殊有無限之　佩云云、（八月一日）</p>

<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>偶然在××里經過，忽然聽到一陣雜亂無章的讀書聲，於是就引起了我的好奇心，毫不猶豫的一脚跨進×號的大門，暫時充了個不速之客。</p>
<p>是一間光綫極壞的小小屋子，裏面放着四五張垢污的方桌，每隻桌子上都是坐滿着一般面有菜色營養不足的小孩。他們有的在灣着背脊寫字，有的在乞丐叫街式的念書，有的在暗裏戲弄，有的在大打瞌睡……</p>
<p>靠窗邊擺着一張長方的舊式賬桌，和一隻足坐兩人的太師椅；椅上就坐着一個頭戴瓜皮紗帽，鼻架老花眼鏡的老塾師正在搖頭播腦的用硃筆改着學生的諜卷，嘴裏還不住地「之乎者也」像蚊子般的低低哼着！</p>
<p>突然他把戒尺猛力一拍，嘴裏高聲喊着，「福生過來」！馬上一個十一二歲的小學生，帶着戰慄畏懼的神情，跑到他的案前，老塾師頓時鬍鬚一蹺，接連的譽了一大串，同時這根紅木的戒尺，也就接連的在小手掌裏劈拍拍的響起來！</p>
<p>這時他才一眼瞧見了我這站任門口的不速之客，就一面起身和我招呼，一面在他喉嚨裏哼哈一響，吐出了一口濃痰；似乎是先來一下淸喉運動，然後再預備和我談話！</p>
<p>他告訴我他是前淸頂括括的舉入老爺，坐館也足足坐了二十多年，在從前學生束修之奉，已足一家溫飽，但是年來學校林立，搶去了他們的飯碗，而且官廳還要嚴厲取締，言下大爲歎息，欷歔不止！</p>
<p>他這番冬烘頑固，愁窮說苦的神情，非但引不起我的同情，反而使我十足的厭惡。我始終主張在這讀書識字運勁風起雲湧的現在，這種內部腐收貽害人家子弟的私塾，實有取締掃除的必要！</p>
<h3 id="c150">從諺語說起 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— 某</p>
<p>現在文人們往往自詡淵博，引用在文章裏的所謂古典，其在從前，怕就多數是當時的諺語，而經孔子删存的三百篇詩，更有强半顯然是民間歌謠型，這類古語和古詩，不論屬於任何方面的描寫與歌詠。流誦室今，都覺具有特別美感，令人愛不忍釋，所謂古語古詩的價值，亦卽在此。</p>
<p>因爲這種諺語，大都發乎天籟，具對沒有斵飾造作的存份。不過當在口頭傳述的時候，一瞥卽逝，自難感到多厚的興味，一經收入文人的筆底，便如明珠美玉，斐然可觀，而爲行文的絕妙資料了。</p>
<p>各地有各地的獨有諺語，而此諺語的產生，都有生活與社會的根據，所以在諺語上可以窺出生活的形態，和社會的現象。譬如病者的呻吟，行樂時的歡呼，失意時的嗟嘆，傷痛時的悲哀，憤怒時的　哨，都是不容勉强的，上海的社會生活，都要比較複雜，而在目前，更是充滿着種種畸形狀態。因之上海的諺語，錯亂繁沉，也就不比其他地方的單純浮淺，所以如果研究上海的社會生活的實際情狀，從這諺語入手，是最好不過的途徑，同時，這種諺語在文學方面，自也比較的更具價值。</p>
<p>汪仲賢君，近著上海俗語圖說一書，現在已將殺靑的一部出版問世，汪君不但居滬甚久，而且都曾深入各個社會。尤其汪君又是戲劇家，對於上海自更有着深切的認識，所以這一部書，只有他擅長書中除將上海所有諺語一一收入外，還以明爽簡練的筆調，一一道其出處，繫以故事，讀後每令人威到上海的五臓六腑，都在這部書中了。同時爲增興趣起見，並由許曉霞君逐篇繪圖，示以形聲，所以論書是美具難並，論其在各方面的貢獻，這價值更是無法估計。　（全書一原冊，都四十萬言，售一元二角，由寗波路廣西路社會日報館發行）</p>

<p>第三十章　朝荷迎日</p>
<p>當太后决定了怎樣去處罰那作惡的廣東巡撫的一天，伊雖然巳不顧了情面，捐棄了仁愛，毅然决然的宣佈了伊的主張；但這種主張原祗是受了公正心的一時的驅使，並非出自伊的本意，過後伊就想到了那個受處罰的人的祖及父在本朝所立的功績，以及他本人過去所表顯的幾樁功勞，使伊頓覺無限不安。臉上的笑容，全部收歛了起來，老是鐵靑地彷彿正懷着滿肚的憂憤的樣子。我見了不由好生奇怪，雖然我也知道是爲着那叛臣的緣故，但在那時候，我却還不知道這個處罰的性質，竟是那樣的嚴重影饗又是那樣的久遠，所以我很奇怪在旣已處罰之後，何必又抱什麽不安呢？</p>
<p>爲了太后一人的不快，於是整個的大內，便又照例的陷入一團灰色的氛圍中去了；所有的太監，宮娥，甚至女官們，都一齋擔心着，惟恐適逢其會的給伊抓去做洩憤的工具。大家連走路也不敢隨便，踮起了足尖，竭力的不使它發出聲音來：說話是特別的减少，卽使有話要說，也祗　用耳語的方法。其實太后倒不曾懷着什麽怒意，祇是心中覺得很難過，像有什麽東西鯁着一樣；祇看伊屢次張開嘴唇，想跟我說什麽話，但屢次都忍住了，可見伊心上眞是想得很苦悶。（三八〇）</p>

<h3 id="c153">潘簫九軼事 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 南丁</p>
<p>吳門潘簫九先生，久經宦海，倦游歸海上，頗有俠聲。最精於相字之學與南宋謝石不同，爲相字中最上等的一流，旣無字卷，又隨人任意點宇，所拆字理，極合情理，所以友好親戚，每逢了疑難的事務，常請他相字指示，經潘指示之後，無不靈騐如神，因此都稱他做謝石第二。</p>
<p>潘與張宗昌，早年極熟，有深交，張督魯後，潘因張政聲不佳，雖得了張幾次的招聘，仍未前往，後來張到上海，遇見了潘，便把他拖到了濟南，潘因無意爲官，在濟南同了程國瑞邱鳳眞等，縱情風月，不常與張見面，此時李景林，方自直退入濟南。天津已爲馮玉祥所得，李欲借張軍力，恢復天津，但因馮勢正盛，尙未實行出兵。一夕，李忽做一夢，見大脾樓三個，正中的頂上，有「魁武」兩字，右面有一樊崇」兩字，左面却是「樊鈺」兩字，醒來之後，歷歷目前，大奇，因言於張，張是個粗人，那裏知道什麼字意，這時邱鳳眞，方任山東高等法院院長，在張的旁邊，便想到了潘的相字，遂向張李說知，張李亦素聞潘的相字有神騐，立即命邱請潘到督署研究。到了明天，潘聞邱至，李即將夢中六字，請潘一相，潘看了之後，因這時正在十二月中，便說出了很妙的字理，說第一個「樊」字，中間含看兩個木字，一個××字，兩個木字，合併便是李景林的林字，這時是冬季，木正在凋零之際，逢了六××卦，六××一動，即有戰爭之事，把林中分，所以李景林失了天津，但是那一個「樊」字，是在左面，須從右過去。冬季過去，便到春天，春天木欣欣向榮，六××戰爭之後，兩個樊字之下，都有大字，成了兩大，可以同張各得一大，恢復了天津，重作一人爲大之事，又以「崇」字，乃山下之宗，即泰山之靠張宗昌，「鈺字」爲金爲玉，即金蘭之好吳子玉，仰些二人，可以重得失地，致「魁」字從鬼，加酉爲醜，敵人小醜，無作顧慮，從斗加門正屬戰鬥之時，「武」字，止戈爲武，但此時正當用武之秋，何能止戈，而此戈字，並非正寫戈字，乃一反戈，因須防倒戈之人。相畢之後，李因吳子玉正屬金蘭，大奇其言，張則因有倒戈之說，欲聞潘須防何人，潘初不言，至出門時，暗與邱言，所謂倒戈的人，乃方振武，已暗示於張，即防有倒戈之防字中有方字，正當用武中有正武二字，果然不到三天，方振武倒戈，至明年春，李景林得張與吳子玉之力，重又入了天津，潘的相字，至此已完全應騐的了。</p>
<p>有一次一個朋友請潘相一個腦字，潘即告他留神，因腦字有災字頭，凶字底災象雖未成，而有凶事，友又問何人有凶凶爲何事，潘謂腦字寫法，可寫作腦，中有凶字，乃有人死亡，腦字之旁爲肉，有人寫月，可稱似骨肉而非骨肉，只有兒媳，當速防之，友再問死在何日，潘將月字加其成期，期中有月，即爲本月，而其字適爲廿六八三字拚成，爲廿六下午八時，其後此友的兒媳，竟在月內廿六日下午八時死亡，這種神騐，同謝石也不差什麼了。其餘尙有張宗昌在李紀才打到濟南八里窪時，請潘相一「一」字，潘斷定不妨，因是年爲丑年，丑爲牛，牛下加一，適爲生字，惟至卯年，則一下加卯，成爲死象，後來李紀才果即敗退，張在卯年死掉。</p>
<p>現在潘君，因了應朋友之請，現巳定八月一日起始，在上海設硯相字，從此之後，我們倘有疑難的事情，可以請潘指示，不致誤入歧途了。</p>

<p>志前道：好像那位張先生，已經答應和你帮忙了吧？浣花手扶了空杯子。呆着眼珠不動，眉頭微微的蹙起，似乎他心裏很難受。志前道：這也難怪他，在外面作客的人，無非想掙幾個錢帶回家去享受，那裏有許多　帮助別人？浣花很低的聲音道：那是當然。祗是……祗是……他不該騙我。一個我字，擒着說出來，立刻兩行淚珠在臉上滾着。他來不及用手絹來擦眼淚，就用手指在　睛上摸着。志前看到他哭，又聽到他說受了騙，這下文如何，是不必問的。便道：我看這位張先生，今天是大忙而特忙，也許他來不及帮你的忙。浣花道：程先生，你沒有聽到嗎？剛才他說了，要到明天才能帮我的忙呢？他知道我歸心似箭，故意這樣說的。其實我眞的等到了明天，他也末見得能帮我的忙。志前道：你以爲這樣，就是他騙了你嗎？院花又垂若淚道：程先生是個聰明人，還用我細說嗎？一個飄零的女子，還有什麼讓人家騙？無非是……在前天晚上，他喝醉了酒，很高與。許我十塊錢，在火車上零用。又說他有個親戚在南京作官，介紹我去找他，他可以送我到上海的火車票，還可以送錢。我自然是相信。昨天大家又混在一起，忙這朱姑娘的事，我在他屋裏坐到晚上一點多鐘，他說今早有客來，要我回去，我也祗好回去（二八〇）</p>

<p>遊覽日程</p>
<p>中華基督敎靑年會全國協會、爲使各代表遊覽我國著名勝跡、特增加遊覽一項、日程如下、（一）北平（故宮天壇）（二）長城一日、（三）由北平南下途中二日、（四）濟南（泰山）二日、（五）曲阜一日、（六）由曲阜南下途中二日、（七）南京一日、（八）杭州二日以上、共計遊覽全程十四日云、</p>
<p>國際少年夏令營概述　周尙夏令營的種類分靑年少年兒童和女童諸種、夏令營的起源、由於歐洲海陸軍學生團和男童隊在野外營幕內生活而來、迨童子軍脫穎而出篷帳的敎練遂成一時的風氣、</p>
<p>英國於一九一八年頒怖敎育條例第十七條明文規定各地敎育行政機關應盡力創辦或裏助辦理夏令營、丹麥·瑞典·德意志各國的成績最著、美國夏令營同樣的風起雲湧地創辦、去年沿太平洋一帶設有五百七十五個、東隣日本邇亦效顰學步、有後來居上之槪、我國年來也自告奮勇地幹着、天津·南京·上海各市的兒童健康營、大家已知道了、</p>
<p>各國自辦的夏令營已有頭緒了、於是日內瓦世界靑年會協會少年部發起組織「太平洋國際少年夏令營、」第一届於一九二九年在日本舉行、到十三國代表一百餘人、一九三一年在檀香山舉行第二届國際少年夏令營、此時我國開始派代表參加、一九三三年爲第三屆、地點在菲列賓、今年是第四届、前年議决挨到在我國開設、現定營址假靑島燕兒島、此島四面環海、風景幽美、柳絲如廉、波紋如　游泳划船、都極便利、早由上海靑年協會推派幹事籌備了、</p>
<p>這營的宗旨便在聯終沿太平洋各國的少年、以友誼的態度、來研討各國開的情勢和人生問題、所以謀交換智識·技能·習尙求謀種族間的諒解、同時發展少年人格、鍜鍊身體、一樣地被當作重要目的、像這種營的價值、可得而言的、一日矯正身體和心理的缺陷、二日養成良好習慣、三日啓發心靈與道德、四日產生互助合作精神、五日接近自然界、六日利用閒瑕裨益於性情的陶冶總之、道德·健康·世界大同爲此營的理想目的、同時亦係此營的最高價值、</p>
<p>因爲這營由於基督敎靑年會主持、故各處代表、自亦不出靑年會方面的範圍、這次代表預計參加的約一百二十二人、內有各國領袖二十四人、參加國有日本·朝鮮·美國·夏威夷·坎拿大·暹邏·菲列賓·他如沿太平洋國家和寓居遠東各國的僑民也曾派有代表、我國代表定南京·廈門·寗波·上海·廣州·長沙·烟台·福州·杭州·漢口·香港·開封·北平·天津·濟南·靑島等、各大城市分配推選二十七人並請領袖六人、代表資格限十六歲至十九歲的高中一二年級學生而富有活動能力的、</p>
<p>每位代表用費約五十四元、合計八天膳食自上午至靑島來回通車旅費和報名費等、但個人用費例外、這營閉幕後、擬再組織一個游覽團、自由參加作二星期的日程、如北平·濟南·曲阜·南京·杭州各處、均編入程序中、每人約需費百元左右、至於這營的生活程序、見八月二日各報敎育欄「吳市長今日歡迎國際少年夏令營代表」消息中、恕不詞費、</p>

<p>乃德看見這樁興奮的比賽，竟至出了神，不知不覺已逐　離開了他的角落，冒着險走了出來；到後來一個很活動的男孩子，騎着扶梯滑下來的時候，因爲用力太猛，連自己都抑勒不住，於是翻落了扶梯，砰然一聲摔在地下，乃德聽了，也就忘了自己，便趕到那個人的身邊，想來他必己頭破血流而半死了。那知這個小孩的頭經過十一年不斷的碰撞，已堅硬得如砲彈一般！因此他祗把眼睛急速重霎了一回子，不半晌他已安靜地仰看着這個新面孔，不勝驚奇地向他招呼，喊了一聲「哈囉！」（註一）</p>
<p>（註一）Hallo係對人招呼之詞，與我國的一聲「喂」相仿。但此處的Hallo。並寓有歡然相遇之情，似非「喂」字所能盡故直譯。</p>
<p>「哈囉，」乃德也回答道，因爲他不知這更有別的可說，想來那種答語的方式是最簡捷而又便利的。</p>
<p>那個伏地的靑年，一點也不動彈，却又問題「你是新來的男小孩嗎？』</p>
<p>「現在還不知道。」</p>
<p>「你呌什麽名字？」</p>
<p>「白乃德。」</p>
<p>「我呌做龐韜摩；上去來一下子好嗎？」韜摩就一躍而起，似乎驟然記到了對生客責任模樣。</p>
<p>「恐怕我還是不做罷，且看我能不能够留在這裏再說，」乃德回道，可是他想留住的欲望却与时而俱深了。</p>
<p>「我說，小橋，這裏又來了一個。你來招呼他；」這精神篷勃的韜摩說了之後，又回復到他原有的游戲，興致還是和以前一般地濃厚。</p>
<p>那坐在梯階上的男孩子，聽見他呌了，就舉起一雙　黃色的大眼靑，仰頭一看，再停了體瘦長眼色和善的童子，容相上自有一種引人的力量。</p>

<h3 id="c177">談談單紐炭屑話筒 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 石華鑫</p>
<p>在無綫電播音機上，一般的都用炭屑話筒，在比較考究些的播音機上，也有用電容式話筒Condenser　Microphone及活動綫圈式話筒Moving　Coil　Microphone炭屑話筒可以分爲兩種：單紐和雙紐，單紐炭屑話筒在有綫電話中，用得最多，在廣播機上，則大半用雙紐炭屑話筒，以及其他的式樣，然而單紐炭屑話筒的最大優點，就是在同一强度的音波輸入中，輸出最大，因此多級的放大裝置，也就可以避免。而失眞程度，在適當的調節下，可以减少到最低限度，爲了上列優點，在業餘界中，單紐炭屑話筒用得最多。</p>
<p>它的構造如第一圖，A是有彈性的膜片，用橡皮圈FF固定在話筒蓋E上，B＇B，是兩塊炭精板，B板是固定的，B板則興膜片A連接，可以隨着膜片一起振動，B，B＇板之間是極細的炭屑C，G是雲母片，H是絕緣的匣蓋，D是匣子四壁上的一圈絕緣紙，B，B兩板也就是話筒的接綫柱。我們在，B，B兩板上接上直流電源，就有電流由B板經炭屑流至B板；或由B板經炭屑流至B板，同時我們對着話筒講話，膜片A跟着音波振動，這振動傳至B板，因爲B板是固定的；兩板間的炭屑就受了不同壓力；依着炭屑的特性，B，BB兩板間的阻力，也跟着或小或大，通過的電流也或大或小，興阻力成反比例，興壓力成正比（炭屑的阻力與壓力成反比）因爲壓力和音的波動成正比，所以電流變化的波形和音波完全一樣，達到使用話筒的目的。</p>
<p>話筒中所能通過的電流是很小的，如果電流大過一定的限度之外，炭屑間便要發生火花，失去作用了，普通的單紐話筒，所能通過的最大電流，大約是十分之一安培，在沒有音波作用的時候，大約有五十歐姆到一百歐姆的阻力，所消耗的最大電力，依據公式o.ixo.ixoo等於一瓦特了。此外又有一種低阻率單紐炭屑話筒，大約只有十歐姆到二十歐姆的阻力，通過電流的最大限度是半安培，消耗的最大電力是五瓦特。</p>
<p>膜片A的最大振幅，在普通的話筒上，約爲四千分之一米厘米達.oo25mm如果振幅過大，則輸出電流的波形，便不能和音波一樣，例如話筒上所受到的是正弦波，在膜片的振幅不超出四千分之一米厘時，輸出的電流也是正弦波形，如果振幅漸漸大到限度之外，輸出電流的波形，也就不是純粹的正弦波，而由正弦波與其單數及雙數的副波所組合，產生失眞，失眞的程度，是依着膜片振幅超過限度的大小而增减。</p>
<p>在應用上，單紐炭屑話筒和放大級的配合是用調幅變壓器的（見第二圖）它初級的混合阻力，大約是一百或二百歐姆，話筒的電源可用六弗打的直流電，再用　一只二百歐姆的電位器，跨在電源上，以便調節到最適宜的電壓，話筒變壓器的次級，跨接着一只十萬歐姆的電位器，以便管理輸出的電壓。</p>

<p>— 泡</p>
<p>無綫電的功用是永無止境的，除了供通信之外，更有種種意想不到的用途。有了各種的無綫電療器具，我們的生命更多了一層保障；就是一向認爲難望治愈的「癌」症，近來亦靠了神秘的無綫電波，而得到確切迅速的治療方法。</p>
<p>關於用無綫電波治療癌症的問題致力最多的，當推拉柯斯基氏（George　Lakhovsky）。拉氏最初用波長二公尺的電波，治療因沾染一種腫瘍病微生物而患白色腫瘍的植物；初試的幾天，病勢反見滋長蔓延，但幾十天後腫瘍突消，逐漸痊愈；拉氏因此發覺癌症可以利用電波治療，而深加研究。</p>
<p>其後拉氏又創造一種能同時發出種種不同波長的超短波發振器，試騐結果更好。這時，對這問題發生興趣的漸多，繼續研究的如風起雲湧。某次曾試騐三百個患癌症的，結果極好，其中二起認爲永無痊愈希望的，竟完全治愈。</p>
<p>六年前，拉氏另行設計一能同時發出自四百公尺到十公分間種種波長的减幅波發射機。因爲有倍波，干擾，及外差等等作用，實際上竟有波長約近紅內綫電波，甚至與人目所見的光綫波長相等的電波，同時存在。這機試騐結果極好，甚至用X光及鐳錠不能治療的絕症，竟能手到回春，又據拉氏宣稱，這種治癌器械，施用時並無人工發熱作用（Artificial　lever）。拉氏的新式電療機械</p>

<p>—交直流式收音機之改良—</p>
<p>最近裝置二管收音機一架，眞空管應用6C6，12A7各一枚，前者担任一級回授式檢波之工作，後者之任務爲低放及整流，試騐結果，除選擇性平平者外，其他如靈敏度音質等却頗堪使人滿意。</p>
<p>此機之綫路如圖所示，各零件之數値容量均已詳註圖中，此機之收音波長範圍頗廣，自十公尺至五百公尺均可收聽無遺，共用一吋二分半徑四脚揷入式綫圈六枚，波段及綫圈之設計，因篇幅有限，從略。</p>
<p>本機凡一百十弗打或二百二十弗打之交流電源均可適用，乙電直接取自商用交流電源，復由整流及瀘波而得，絲極電源則由變壓器降壓取用。</p>
<p>機中雖應用二枚絲壓不同値之眞空管，而電源變壓器之燈絲次級圈仍用一枚，此無他，略思之，不難明其理也，據云，仇貨收音機，大都應用此法，供給機內各式眞空管使用，其經濟便利可想見矣。</p>
<p>本機雖僅能使用於交流電源，而其用電之經濟，誠非交直流式者所能及也，（按此機之電力消耗，約十瓦特不到，若用機使用作交眞流式時，則至少須五十瓦特以上）。</p>
<p>電源變壓器，如欲自製，可用砂鋼片一·五二磅疊至廿六公厘，初級用卅六號漆包綫繞二千四百圈，一半處抽一頭，以備一百十弗打電源時使用之，次級用二十四號漆包綫繞一百廿八圈，於六十四圈處抽一頭，以供6C6絲極用，繞製時之手續，應注意之事項，請參閱本刋一百廿二期學綸君佳作，不贅。</p>

<p>— 學綸</p>
<p>（四）加一級高週率放大</p>
<p>高週率放大之功用，係將收得微弱之高週率訊號，經眞空管放大後，再輸入檢波級，使檢波管得到相當之電壓，所以效率甚高，且高週率變壓器普通多用調節式，因此又可增加選擇性與靈敏度。在電台林立之區，或欲接收遠地播音，當以加高放級爲宜。</p>
<p>現在須先將原機之蛛網板拆下，換用圓筒式綫圈。取直徑三二公厘，長度七六公厘之膠木管二枚，綫圈繞法如左：</p>
<p>高週率變壓器　取膠木管一枚，用三〇號漆包綫繞一〇五圈爲L1，距離三公厘，用同號綫繞二四圈爲L，L1起端接高放管柵極，末端接地，L起端接地，末端接天綫，二綫圈俱同方向。</p>
<p>檢波綫圈　另取膠木管一枚，用三〇號漆包綫繞一〇五圈爲L3，再以三六號漆包綫，距離L3末端三公厘處繞四五圈爲L4，再取二〇公厘闊之絕緣紙在L3上裹一層，以三六號漆包綫五〇圈爲L2，L2起端接高放管屏極，末端接乙正，L3起端接柵電容器，末端接地，L4起端接高　圈，末端接檢波管屏極，三綫圈之方向俱同。</p>
<p>裝配收音機時，盡人皆知最難裝是高放級，但高放級並非有深奧之學理，及需巧妙之技術，不過高放易起感應，及高週率變壓器之次級與檢波之次級，兩綫圈之感應量須絕對相同而已。所以除兩綫圈須用鋁隔離罩外，三九號與三六號兩眞空管亦須用鋁罩隔離之，以防互威作用。</p>
<p>新加高放級接綫完畢，卽爲全部收音機完成之時，綫路如六圖所示，此時先宜細細檢查有無錯誤之處，然後將電源接上，開啟電源開關，緩緩旋動刻度盤與電位器，俟揚聲器發生嘯聲，再將電位器旋鈕退回少許，至振盪適止爲止，此時揚聲器中卽可發出很淸晰之聲浪矣。倘音量太輕，或糢糊不淸，或怪叫不止，可將雙連變量電容器之償補電容器較準之，設仍不能淸晰，乃係二次級綫圈相差太巨，必須重繞之。所用各零件如左；</p>

<p>— 陳憲文</p>
<p>（一）光電管的話：</p>
<p>光電管在近代科學界要算時髦而最有用的一件東西，許多精密的儀器或機器都會用到它。平常人總以爲自己的眼睛可靠，但是要和現在這個電眼（光電管的別名）來比，還是望塵莫及　靈敏的光電管很容易檢測出三公里外一技臘燭所發的光。因它有這樣的靈敏度，所以常用它來擔任精密的檢測工作，如有聲電影，　文學內的測量術（Star　photometry），傳送　　（Transmission　of　Picrures）電視（Tele·Vlion）以及自動光號（Automatic　Light　Signals）等。</p>
<p>（二）音的性質：</p>
<p>我們平常聽到的聲音，牠的振動週率固有一定的限制，（按普通人所聽到的爲每秒二十次至一萬餘次）但牠的强度如小於或大於某一定的數値時，則亦不能辨別或生痛苦的感覺。普通所能聽到的最小聲音（就是指小於此點的聲音就不能聽得）所具有的强度，呌做聽聞起點（Thresholdofudobility）若聲音的强度慢慢增加，至達到起痛苦的時候，這種强度就呌做感覺起點（Threshold　of　Feeling）。上面所說的聽聞起點和感覺起點所需要的聲音的强度，都隨聲音的週率而變，牠們相互的關係，略舉出幾個寫在下面：</p>
<p>聲的週率　聽聞起點　感覺起點</p>
<p>（三）眞空管的話：</p>
<p>收音機內眞空管的燈絲電，於可能範圍內，最好用到最小。但以不减小效力爲原則；因爲這樣可以使眞空管延年益壽。按普通眞空的燈絲使用電壓（Operating　Voliage）爲它的規定電壓（Rated　Voltage）的百分之九十時，效力並不减小。這一點小知識，講經濟的業餘家不可不注意。</p>

<h3 id="c184">我所希望於商務印書館者 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 張素民</p>
<p>商務印書館，是中國最大的出版家，這是人人知道的。其總經理王雲五先生之道德學問，經理才能，和其內部職員之努力，以及組織之優良，也是大家所佩服的。從一二八以來，商務印書館更加努力，出版的新書，一天一天的多，這更是我們文化界好現象。</p>
<p>但是我們正因爲敬愛商務印書館，所以對牠的希望更奢，對牠的責備更嚴。本此動機，特來說點我個人對牠的希望。</p>
<p>中國今日出版界程度之低，恰爲我們社會知識敎育程度之低的反照。編著的書，好的固少，翻譯的書，更只是白紙上堆黑字，令人無法卒讀。我因爲平日對於商務印書館的信仰，對於牠出版的書籍，當然是「另眼相看。」平心而論，牠的書籍，就大概而言，是比較的好一點。然把一本一本的仔細讀起來，也覺得好的少，壞的多。卽翻譯的書，也脊謬誤很多的。推原其故，不出二端：——</p>
<p>一、對「名人」太客氣，太講情面，而同時過於注重一時的利潤。名人的著作，本來應該是好的。然而中國的名人，也有由「牛皮」造成的：牛皮雖大，學問文章仍淺。例如商務出版的某名人的最近某名著，若以外國大學敎授看本科學生的畢業論文的眼光來講，簡直是「不及格」，至小是應「重寫」。第一因爲那書的標題與內容不符，第二因爲那書所用的譯名，前後不一致，第三因爲那書內容的矛盾和謬誤之處太多。然而商務竟將那書一字不改的出版了！書價須三四元，買來實後改悔。從「內容」看來，不過冤枉花了幾塊錢：但「外行」買之，將視爲「名著」，以之爲「權威」。此「謬種流傳」之害，遠過於幾塊洋錢的損失。這不能不說是商務的編輯部對「名人」太講情面。我希望商務以後審查稿件，不問作者姓名，須嚴格審查內容。</p>
<p>但天下事有出人意料之外，以那樣不能及格的書，又在今日經濟凋敝的中國，賣價在三四元以上，居然再版三版的暢銷起來。若從謀利的觀點講，商務的眼光高，我的眼光低；那部書是於商務有利的。然這種銷路是一時的，不能持久的。因爲買書的人，大都和我一樣，鑒於作者牛皮之大，買一部來領敎領敎。然讀了之後，始知大上其當，不敢再介紹別人來買了。所以卽爲謀利計，商務的編者應該勸作者將題目與內容稍加修改，再予出版，則銷路或可持久。何必重視一時的利潤？</p>
<p>二、重量不重質，選稿不嚴。商務的新書，每天都有。在量的方面，就中國的情形講，並不爲少。但書籍這種東西，與普通商品有別，不是可以「大量生產」的。買書的人，是要把書拿來研究，以期取得知識學問的。若打開一看，卽發現其內容膚淺，甚或條理不明，令人莫名其妙；甚或形式也不完備，如材料的來源，參考書籍等，一字不提。若是譯本，則一頁中有幾句令人讀不懂，甚或有整段的讀不懂，則這種書籍有何用處？商務的書，因比較的好，然這類的書，亦復不少。我希望商務的編者，以後選稿，宜較嚴格。所謂嚴格，不一定是拒絕不受；卽對於可受的稿子，詳細批註應行刪改之處，令作者或譯者自加刪改，再予出版，也是嚴格之一法。若是專門書，最好是由編輯部的專家審訂，或偶請外面的專家審訂，亦無不可。</p>
<p>上述兩點希望，是可適於一般出版界的。然我特別對商務言之者，是因爲以商務的資望能力，實行較易，可首先倡導，以求出版物的質的進步。鄭宗楷</p>

<p>— 鄭宗楷</p>
<p>日本適用出版之法律的種類，可分爲普通出版及新聞報紙出版兩種。普通出版是適用「出版法」的出版，又分爲所謂普通出版與預約出版。預約出版是適用「出版法」以外的「預約出版法」的出版，新聞紙出版是適用「新聞紙法」的出版。</p>
<p>所謂普通出版，即是適用「出版法」而不適用「預約出版法」及「新聞紙法」之規定出版是。不但單行本，繪畫，地圖，寫眞等，屬於普通出版，就是記載學術，技藝，統計，廣告之類的雜誌等出版，也是屬於普通出版。</p>
<p>一　普通出版責任者</p>
<p>日本著作者，發行者及印刷者，對於出版上，均應負擔一定的責任，這些人稱爲「出版責任者，」試分別說明如左：</p>
<p>（一）　作者依日本「出版法」規定，所謂著作者，就是著述及編纂文書製作圖畫之謂，如係演說或講義的筆記，以演說者或講義者爲著作者　但得　記者，演說者或講義者的允許，自爲出版的塲合，其筆記者視爲著作者。編纂書以編纂者爲著作；翻譯者以翻譯者爲著作者；學校，公司，恊會等的出版，以其出版呈報署名的代表者，視爲著作者。</p>
<p>（二）發行者日本「出版法」規定，所謂發行者，就是負擔發賣頒布者之謂。發行者不限於著作者及其繼承人，須係以販賣文書圖畫爲業者。</p>
<p>（三）印刷者日本「出版法」規定，所謂印刷者，就是負擔印刷者之謂。但非負擔各個的印刷行爲的人，而是負完成印刷行爲之全部的責任者之謂。故以有印刷所者爲印刷者，而印刷所係數人共有時，以營業上代表其印刷所者爲印刷者。</p>
<p>二　出版的星報</p>
<p>日本「出版法」規定，凡出版文書圖畫時，由其發行之日起，除到達的日數外，須於前三日連問出版物製本二份呈報內務省。官廳出版時，於發行前連同出版物製本二份，送達內務雀。其呈報書須由著作者或其繼承人及發行者連署呈報，但在非賣品時，僅由著作者及發行者呈報即可。無版權保護的出版及著作者或其繼承人不明時，僅由發行者呈報亦可。至於學校，公司，恊會等的出版，須由其代表者與發行者連署呈報。</p>
<p>追加册號而順次出版者，有每次呈報的必要。但在雜誌之類，如受內務大臣的許可，可省略其呈報手續，僅呈繳其出版物即可。再版時，除改正，增减及加入註解，附錄，繪畫等塲合之外，母庸呈報。關於書簡，通信，報告，社則，傳單，寫眞等特殊出版物，完全不要履行呈報的手續。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c186">從著書到出書（三） <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 器重</p>
<p>製型是怎麼製法呢？就是將排好而校改好的活字版交給製型工人，他們就用漿糊把紙糊成了一張幾重的紙，放上活字版，然後用大毛刷在上面敲打。你不要以爲這工作也是誰都會做的，假如你是外行，你去打幾下，把紙打破了，那就必須換紙，打得不當心，紙移動了，字的筆劃就成了雙劃；打得不均勻，有的很淸楚而有的地方不淸楚，澆版印成之書，模糊不淸，勢必無人購讀。</p>
<p>紙型打好了，就要送到火爐上壓了烘乾；如果壓得不好，或是烘的火力不足，那紙版就不行：烘得火力太足了，說不定紙型要燒燬，那排成活字版的鉛字也要燒燬的，所以烘的時候也得十分注意的。</p>
<p>現在各家大報館，他們的打紙型是用機器的，那不僅打得好，而且費時也少。比方，人工的紙型，打一張須費一小時，而機器則用不到兩分鐘。他們做那種紙型的紙是種精厚的外國紙，只要放上活字在機器壓一下，就得了。可見機器工業要比手工業優良得多。</p>
<p>澆版</p>
<p>紙型打出了，於是送給澆版的工人，他把這紙型用機器壓住了，將熔化的鉛液澆入紙型，揭開來，便成了一塊與活字版一式一樣的鉛版。這鉛版拿上機器去印刷，要比活字版方便得許多。但是，澆鉛版，也是要熟練工人才能澆得好；因爲鉛太熱或是不很熱，或是紙版潮濕，澆出來都有毛病，不能印書的。熟手工人，澆一塊有用一槐，難得有一塊不好用而須重澆的，生手工人，往往連澆數塊，一塊也不適用的。一張紙版，普通可以澆到十多次，不大好的紙版，澆了六七次就沒有用了。</p>
<p>澆好的鉛版，如果排版時中間用有鋅版的，那鋅版的地方還得由工人修過；因爲鋅版的字脚淺，不修過，印的時候旁邊要染墨的。而修鉛版也不容易的，修得不當心，把字修壞了。他們熟手工人是不會修壞的，就是修壞了，會得鍍上一些鉛，修得和原來一樣的。</p>
<p>如果打成了紙版，紙版上發現沒有校出的錯字，可以改紙版；如果已澆好鉛版而才發現，那在鉛版上他們工人可以爲你挖改；但是，如果印了書，書上就無法挖改了。</p>
<p>印刷</p>
<p>澆好的鉛版，送上機器，就可印書。但書是小小的一本，而紙是大大的一張，所以一張大的紙，要印成好幾張的書。書本的大小不一定　，有八開的，十二開的，十六開的，二十開的，二十三開的，二十四開的，二十五開的，三十二開的，三十六開的，四十開的，四十六開的，五十開的，六十開的，六十四開的，甚至，還有一百二十八開的。每一種開數，鉛版排列的方式不同，排錯一塊，裝訂時就要頁次倒誤，所以不但要細心，簡直是一種不大好幹的工作。如果你排錯了一塊，將來發現錯誤，這一個賠賬你吃下來可不得了！</p>
<p>還有，要注意到的是美觀，假使有一塊版排得太高一些或是太低一些或是歪了，失掉了全書的統一性，書就失掉美觀了；還有，統一固統一了，而天地頭之太高太低，以及版口之太進太出，都是失掉美觀，並且說不定裝訂時把字訂着了，或是把字切去了，那不僅不美觀，簡直成了一堆廢紙，所以你看來好像機器在印書，工人不過在旁着移動紙張，很省力，但你看到這一些，你就知道工作大家都是不易的。</p>
<p>我再告訴你一些印書時的事件，那就是紙張和油墨了。紙張有光有毛，有厚有薄。光的好印而毛的不好印；厚薄適度的好印而太厚太薄的不好印；並且，紙的名目，種類繁多，各種紙有種不同的紙性，有堅，有鬆，有靸，有脆，而性質不同，受墨各異，故必須懂得紙的性質，須用何種油墨，那才印刷時可减少困難。</p>
<p>書是印好了，於是，送進裝訂作（即製本所）去裝訂成書。</p>
<p>裝訂</p>
<p>裝訂是成書的最後一種手續。當書在機器上印好後，送交裝訂作，他們先把大張的紙切成小張，然後送交工人一帖一帖摺起來。這摺書的工人，大都是女人充任的，摺好了由裝訂工人拿去依了頁次的先後，一帖一帖放在桌上，整理起來成爲一本本的書坯，然後再行裝訂。</p>
<p>裝訂的方法有幾種，如用綫在每帖中摺處穿訂的呌做「綫裝」，如在書脊近處打三個眼，用綫穿訂的呌做「平裝」，如用鐵絲代綫的呌做「鐵絲訂」。前兩種是用手工的，後一種是機器的，這是指小規模的裝訂作而言的。如果大的裝訂作，則各種裝訂，概用機器代替人工。不過「鐵綫訂」是用於裝訂雜誌等簿的刋物，那是因其快的緣故，至於厚的書，則因鐵銹而易損壞，故普通大都不用。</p>
<p>裝訂的形式，有布面的西洋裝，有平脊的日本裝，有毛邊的法國裝，有細訂的中國裝。書蕊裝好了，才後冉裝封面。說到封面，也是麻煩得很的，精裝，要燙金，平裝的要用彩印，而這裝幀書面，又化了裝幀先生不少的心血；蓋其設計不美觀，使讀者對於是書之購買要减掉不少影響也。裝好了，然後再一包包包好了，送出去發賣。</p>
<p>結束</p>
<p>書發賣時櫥窗的布置，廣告之設計，也要廢去不少人的心血，但我們且不去談他，我們單看從著書到成書的手續，已感到不少麻煩耗人不少心血了。以上所述是出書的常識，想讀者不會以我說得太簡略而以爲不値一讀吧！（完）</p>

<h3 id="c187">又是一篇摩登賬 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>去年因爲是婦女國貨年，所以當海關關於婦女消耗品入口驚人數字發表之時，曾經引起一般人對於婦女大加斥責，認爲旣奢靡，又不愛國。今年國貨年的責任已由婦女移到學生，自然更不能引起人們的注意。但是我們以爲國貨年不應當成爲一種把戲，演完一套換一套，目的在敷衍目前，欺誑臺下的觀衆而已；所以不辭聒絮，逆「摩整」小姐奶奶們之耳，再來談談這回事。</p>
<p>茲據國定稅則委員會與新聞記者談話，謂「本年份上半年單以香水脂粉二項婦女消耗品輸入，共達國幣五十五萬八千七百七十元，較之上年同期，未見若何减落。其中以美日法三國進口最多，大多爲上海之摩登婦女所消耗」云云。自然，這不過是膏唇飾膚的一小部份，若以各種衣着珍飾器用之類來統計，其「驚人」當不止此。</p>
<p>這一數目與幾萬萬元的入超比較，實在微乎其微，可是它的嚴重，就在於這是一種不生產的耗費。在助長國內生產事業方面的大量入口這種奢侈消耗品的大量輸入，表示出我們婦女現在正競於「摩登」。固然不能否認「愛美」差不多是人類的天性，但是這一「摩登」的趨尙，却包含着無數的惡因惡果。首先是婦女的冶容修艷，表現成許多喪廉失德的事情，造成許多風流的孽債，其結果必然是女子蒙受損失。其次因爲這一「長姹婦女競向侈邪」事態的影響，也引導整個社會走入於頹廢奢侈的境况中，自然「靡靡傳志」，結果又是社會人心的淪落，人們意志的滅亡。這種現象我們自然不站在「衛道之士」方面，來主張甚麼「恢復舊道德」的「移風易俗」，但是我們爲遏止「奴性」的增長，並挽回爭取獨立解放的决心與意志，都是反對婦女這種「忘掉現實」的罪惡的。</p>
<p>爲此，又開了一篇婦女「摩登」的總賬，希望婦女們能得到一些驚惕，非徒心長言重已也。</p>
<h3 id="c188">石岐一瞥 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>南國的大都市的夜裏是囂張的，那華麗的堤岸上高矗着的大厦透出來迷人底燈光，跟那煌耀奪目的碼頭上的街燈，人們底擁擠，苦力們的喊叫，組成不平靜的夜裏，噪雜底聲息，在移動着，喧擾着。在這個時分，經又帶着旅人的悾惚底心情，跨上了船艙里，讓牠帶着飛在黑夜的海面流盪着向下流去——夜裏的河面是黝黑的，魔鬼在張大了嘴巴似的，顯得異常的冷靜而凄凉。除了聽到了那老是不變的嘩啦嘩啦的江水的衝擊底聲息以外，便是海風迢迢的飄揚。</p>
<p>在船上，很快就疲乏地睡着了。等到第二天，溫柔的太陽已愉快地在東方微笑着的時候，我才給一大羣旅人或自水手們的嘩雜的聲音擾醒，揉了一揉眼睛的就跑到甲板上，去吸受新鮮的早晨底海風，那時，眼睛眺望出去的時候，可以看見兩岸的蘆葦和平野上的綠林，那麽妖媚似的穿上了大自然的美麗的衣裳。</p>
<p>船經過了不欖，不久就抵達繁華的石岐。當船還在海風的時候，我可以看得到不平整的碼頭排列似地峙在岸邊，岸上飄着各色各式的不同底旗幟，招徠似的。那不齊整的新舊的建築物跟着看不完的碼頭展開得老遠的。市里的高山上的荒蕪的塔項在淸靜的早晨更顯出可怕的慘淡與寂寞底悲哀。市道上間，或有一些高高地矗立着的大酒店，那兒正在驕傲地飄揚着國旗——是的，那是鄉村里的繁華的市塲上的天的驕兒呀！</p>
<p>船泊在那不很淸潔的碼頭底時候，我還沒有踏上岸就有許多挑子或車夫們攔着我的去路，你一句我一句的吵得交不開的：</p>
<p>「喂！先生！××旅店去吧！那兒是五折計算！要車不要？」</p>
<p>「來來！這里，我拉你去，我拉你去……」</p>
<p>那情形實在跟大都市中沒有兩樣，從各方面可以看得到那兒蘊藏着欺騙的和可怕的罪惡。那一些帶着狡滑的氣味兒的人們就覬覦似地集在我底身上。</p>
<p>在闊大的馬路上流浪着的時候，可以從擠擁的人羣里瞧着和大都市的一切一不兩樣的。大商店的門口有着張大了嘴巴喊着的伙計，有着綉上花朵的大减價的旗旌，有着苦笑的臉孔，有些顯得生意異常熱鬧的，有些却是冷淡得或伙計也打酣睡了。百貨大公司的留聲機的調子波揚得那麽起勁的。那大旅店像怕人不知道美麗似的，還在門檻外擺出了生意經的動人底花樣。還有，大酒店的櫥</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>子裡透出來的馨香，大戲院透出來的迷人的音樂，大銀行的高清和嚴肅，這一切的，配上了大都市化的女兒們糊上了香粉底臉孔，迷人的時裝，高跟鞋的裊娜的資態——這一切都可以代表了孫總理的家鄉底繁華，進步的色彩已跟着時代的輪子輾轉個不停的。也許，這兒算是個很出色的市填吧！就是這兒的「盲公餅」「蠔油」「海味珍品」，一切的出產都是挺有名聲的</p>
<p>廣關的市塲上的街道，縱橫或灣曲的。當我跑到疲乏的時候，才跨上了高高的山峯上的和尚寺里去吸取新鮮的江風。這時，更可以看見了一個新興的市鎮的蓬勃的色彩，那白色的建築物跟白色的天空反照着，到處還見到從小工廠的黑烟筒里冒出來的黑烟，一股一股地向天空散開。</p>
<p>除了一些奢華的影子以外，我們還可以看到樸實的姑娘們的，康健體魄的在街上來去着——這一切的都令人不能忘記了牠（石岐）是一個有着茂盛的氣息的新興的市鎮，到處蘊藏着生動而撩人的影子呢。</p>
<h3 id="c189">海病 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>人還沒有到海上來的時候，便聽見別人說，身體不健康的人到了海上是會「暈浪」的。暈浪在斯文人們說來，是「海病」。也就是說，到了海上才生的病，一脫離了海，病也就用不着醫治也會慢慢地好起來的了。這種病，本來沒有國界，并非洋人們便不會，而且這海病的名稱還是從洋人那里番譯得來的哩。海病本來是一種可怕而又奇怪的病，不過還只是不康健的人才較有着很多機會的：安樂慣了的朋友，突然地走到這瘋狂一樣的海里來，過着那種不安定而且顛倒得要命的生活，當然過不慣咧，因此便發生了精神上的不舒服而至嘔吐，頭暈，實在是很有理由的。爲了這，雖然朋友們怎樣警告着我，我也不把它當作一會事，因爲從來我不是過慣了安樂的生活的人，而且在海上生活的時候也不很少，雖然是內河，可是也不一樣嗎。因此我這一次雖說是獨自個兒漂到了海上，可也並不害怕的。</p>
<p>船慢慢地駛出了內河，駛到了漫無天際的太平洋沿岸來了。本來這尚岸的海浪，比之太平洋橫貫時的海浪，是小巫和大巫的，可是和內河一比，却又大巫和小巫的。而且時候又是秋初，明浪是不大，而「暗湧」是非常厲害，也就是水的反動，它們都在海的內部革命着，表面上雖然沒有喜馬拉雅山一樣高的波浪拋着過來，可是它們在船身底下不作聲的反動，是更甚於明顯的波濤的。這對於一般生活在舒適安樂的紳士們無疑是一個天大的要挾。於是嘔吐的聲音是跟着船身的不安定，而正比例地增加着了。</p>
<p>大概是幸災樂禍的心理吧，我爲了要看這種文明人的醜態，非特地冒了一次天大的險從統艙里走到那些什麼官艙之類的走了一遍。——「奇境」咧，我看到了許多「小松鼠」「小鳥兒」般的太太們把整個身體伏着在男人的身上，呈着一副象貧血病患者的灰白的臉孔，唇也是白得沒有一點血色，口里掛着了一條長長的口涎，呻吟着在象一個垂危的病者一樣。我心裏在納罕着，誰會相信在都市里安享着的，把臉蛋兒擦得紅紅白白的所謂迷人的「美人」原來便是這樣的一副「骷髏」。</p>
<p>我讚訟着海，她是那樣的公平，她象一個鐵面無私的判官，比之給錢薰陶變了顏色的都市，真是兩樣。她暴動着的權威，便是對於安樂者的一個懲罰。因此，我又想到，海病是沒有什麼界限的，有之先是對於生活着在沒有波濤的人們的一種可怕的試騐。</p>
<p>回頭來想自己，還算好的便是沒有被這種可怕的試騐難着，因爲我原也是生活着在儘是波濤中不安定的生活中的浮浪者，海上和不是海上原也是同一樣地在可怕的暴風雨底下過生活，沒有什麼分別。因此，海雖然厲害，可是它的狂浪在我們已經是一件再尋常不過的事了。甚而至，我還在讚頌着海，因爲它的狂浪的賜予是在不公平當中也算是較爲公平的一種。</p>
<p>不過世界的事是沒有一個確定的看法的，尤其是在這個萬花鏡般的社會里。或者，在另一種人的看法，比方紳士淑女們之類的，也許他們對於這一種類事情的看法，是恰巧和我們相反地，不特不贊許海，而且還咀咒着「海病」對於他們的殘酷。自然，他們或她們的認爲都是對的，實際上他們對於自身的苦難除了覺得別人或第三者是殘酷外，還有什麼！然而，也不能說我贊許海，或者對「海病」好感是不對的啊，當然我也有我的理由，我在社會上的卑微的地位便可以作證。</p>
<h3 id="c190">夏晚（上） <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>彩雲在遠處的炊烟里跳舞着，幽幽的牧笛聲是在附近的田隴間傳過來；在那邊的泥路上正有三五牧童伏在老牛背上緩緩地向村中歸來，而那些農夫們也在田里耘畢了稻，拖着了個疲憊的肢體踽踽的走上了回家的途上。</p>
<p>女人的喝呵，男人的談話，孩子的啼哭，羊子的吼叫，一陣一陣的在村子裏蕩漾，整個的村子裏全充滿了騷擾的聲音，空氣也突然顯得煩囂了。</p>
<p>那些女人纔幫丈夫耘了田回來，然而却還不能使她們有一刻兒休息。匆忙的要哺孩子的乳，又要給羊子喂草，端正燒晚飯，弄浴湯水給男人，替孩子們洗澡，……真是忙得透不過氣來。但是這些不種田而沒有孩子的，却老早吃了晚飯，洗了浴，換過衣服，坐在門前曠塲上去，搖着芭蕉扇乘風凉，有時高興的時候，嘴里還會哼唧哼唧那些古老調子的山歌。她們看她們的忙不開，對於自家兒的悠閒，却不自覺的有些驕傲，然而在她們呢，只有常常自己怨着命：</p>
<p>「一年到頭是像忙人，但是時常還要閙着餓肚子恐慌；不像別人家舒舒服服的倒天天吃得飽，穿得好，既不必上山打柴，更不用下田拔草，　！像我們命生得窮的……」她們有時聽到孩子們的噪，或欄里的羊子叫不迭的時候，便會更引起她們的煩惱與暴躁：「斷命羊子，小鬼，你們都來不及的要斷命了嗎」？</p>
<p>我家屋子裏全是漆黑洞洞的也不點上一支燈，蚊子却在戶內外排起黃河陣來，草蚊烟是極其　嗅的在地上燃燒着，烟務彌漫住了整個屋子。牠們的陣勢也有些動亂了：儘嗡嗡嗡的在空中亂進亂飛，聲音是像散了蜜蜂箱似的。氣膀阿根躺在天井沿上，却變了蚊子們的進攻目標，他一面拿了蒲扇趕，一面却用手劈劈拍拍的打，但牠們還是不住地向他身上每一個部份每一塊肉上偷襲！</p>
<p>「死蚊子，瘟蚊子，老子吃力了要想睡睡你們都要找我的」。他終於咕嘟着爬了起來，走到後門口南反棚底下，在那小石橋上坐了下來。（未完）</p>

<p>今天是我們最可紀念的一天，因爲我們在打魚島工作，今天是開始了。</p>
<p>上午四時起床，集合出發，大隊人馬，浩浩蕩蕩奔向打魚島而去。</p>
<p>石島距打魚島約七八華里，該地又沒有車子可乘，大家只好苦命地的用兩條腿奔跑了！每個人都很興奮，眞是步伐整齊，紀律嚴明。</p>
<p>出得門來眞是好一個天氣也，我們行行重行到了目的地！打魚島。我們在一個漁人家里休息，於是整理道具，化裝…大家都工作起來，我們更祥細觀察他們的一切，對他們的生活行動作進一步的研究。</p>
<p>眞是別有風味的漁人之家，魚腥潮濕氣使我們的氣息爲之閉塞。</p>
<p>田方化了裝後，便和漁人在一起混談，漁人們竟把他當做同伴，和他開起玩笑來了。</p>
<p>我們離開了漁人家到海濱去，工作可就够麻煩的了。船隻爲了是潮不能下水，王大導演也幫着拖曳。才使得船下水去。</p>
<p>符保盧拿起大格搖得很快，使船夫們驚訝，怪咧！幾分鐘他就會搖了。</p>
<p>開末拉的地位擺在一塊岩石上，前面怒濤衝擊着，後面有着深溝，一不當心，便有人機共毀的危險。在更後面的一塊岩石上，站滿了觀光的男女羣，他們的眼，直瞪着那隻神秘的開末拉！</p>
<p>在開拍的時候，又發生了難題：船划到鏡頭里時，船夫不肯下錨停住，並且說下面有暗礁，王大導演被逼得沒有辦法時，便躍入水深十丈的海底，潛伏了六七分鐘後才浮上來，證明了海底是沙底，船夫才安心把錨放下。據說海底確全部是暗礁，爲了要拍戲，不能不欺騙他們了。符保盧，陳天國，田方在水深處打椿，戲拍完之後，仍由王大導演下水將錨取出。</p>
<p>之後，全部人馬又從海邊上船，到遠處去拍幾幅美麗的海景，和歸航的漁舟等。風浪很大，小船行動極不自由，鏡頭的角度也很不容易的呌它安定，可是攝影師沈勇石以百折不撓的精神同海掙扎，勝利終歸是屬於我們的。</p>
<p>小妹妹方琍很聰明，剛到石島幾天就把漁人們的山歌學會了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yutai Breaks Levee, Flooding Towards Fengpei; Northern Embankment Roots Already Submerged; People from Two Counties Build Embankments to Block the Flood; Weishan Lake Water Reaches the South Bank; Emergency Meeting Called by Flood Prevention Committee <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) A telegram from Pei reports that the Yutai levee has broken, and water is flowing into Fengpei, now reaching the roots of the northern embankment of Fengpei, with a depth of one meter. Upon investigation, the northern embankment of Fengpei is connected to the western embankment of Weishan Lake at Gaozhuang in Pei County in the east, and to the Fuxin River embankment in Feng County in the west. People from both counties are working urgently to build and reinforce the embankment. The low-lying fields along the western bank of Weishan Lake in the eastern part of Pei County are also flooded, approaching the new embankment. However, the water from the north is rushing in from the plains, making it particularly fierce. Most of the manpower is deployed to defend the northern embankment. (Second Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water from Weishan Lake has reached the southern bank, and the situation in northern Tongshan is critical. The Flood Prevention Committee will hold an emergency meeting tonight to register for burlap sacks and request a special grant of 2,000 yuan to prepare for flood control. (Second Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Xu Dingkang, concurrently the Director of the Flood Prevention Office for the Jiangbei Canal Area, believes that although the water level in the central section of Weishan Lake is gradually stabilizing, the people of Shandong are always trying to shift the burden onto their neighbors, and there is a constant possibility of the Yellow River's water entering Jiangsu. He has sent a special telegram to the magistrates of Huaiyin, Gaobao, Jiangdu, and five other counties along the canal, ordering them to accumulate 600,000 to 700,000 cubic meters of soil within ten days, covering a length of more than 60 kilometers, to prepare for emergencies. (Second Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the people of Shandong mistakenly believe that the western embankment of Weishan Lake is forcibly suppressing the flow of the Yellow River and intend to open the embankment, shifting the burden onto their neighbors. Chairman Chen, in order to avoid misunderstandings between Jiangsu and Shandong, has urgently telegraphed Wang Shuxiang in Huaiyin, requesting him to negotiate with Shandong to delay the opening and prevent the disaster area from expanding. (Second Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Feng County Magistrate Wang Shuxian telegraphed Xuzhou, reporting that he personally inspected Zhaoyang Lake on the first day, and that the lake, located in the fields south of Yutai, had a breach of 14 zhang. The water flows southward, and is only about ten li away from the Sanhejian of Pei City and the Xiaoyan of Feng City. The water situation is urgent. The people of Feng County are working overnight to build the Fuxin River embankment and are also helping to build the Weishan embankment in Pei County. The Special Commissioner's Office has telegraphed Pei County to intensify the blockade. (Second Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shao Hanyuan inspected Linjiaba yesterday and told reporters that the location is the entrance to the Bulao River connecting Weishan Lake to northern Tongshan. He plans to repair the original dam, but believes the gate is still too small and has decided to widen it further to match the flow of the Bulao River, facilitating the discharge of Weishan Lake water and avoiding impact on the western embankment. He has also submitted a request to the province to prepare to install a gate for future opening and closing. (Second Day Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) A responsible person from the Jiangsu Construction Department said that according to recent reports, the water level at the Zhongmou water gauge station on the Yellow River is only 86.05 meters, and the water level at the Hanzhuang hydrological station on the Weishan Lake of the Grand Canal is 31.57 meters, both lower than in previous days, and far from the highest flood level in the past. The flood disaster in northern Jiangsu may be fortunately avoided, but the breaches need to be blocked, and the autumn floods in August are particularly worrisome. Currently, every effort is being made to prevent them. (Second Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Where Will Industry and Commerce Draw Funds? <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Lun</p>
<p>Shares in Chinese companies have never had a public market or a mechanism for circulation. When they have appeared, they have been as fleeting as the epiphyllum, ultimately ending up with a listed price but no actual market. As a result, it is difficult for buyers to buy and difficult for sellers to sell. This is one reason why investment in companies is not enthusiastic and why company development is not easy. Examining the reasons for this, it is true that the general public lacks a deep understanding of company businesses. However, after decades of industrial development, how many Chinese enterprises have achieved remarkable success? Even those hailed as major industrialists often suffer from poor management. An examination of their internal operations reveals them to be disorganized, chaotic, and unstructured, their emptiness beyond description. As for those who, through a stroke of good fortune, achieve temporary prosperity but fail to sustain it and ultimately fail, the instances are even more numerous. To try to inspire public confidence in investing in companies under these circumstances is like traveling south by heading north. On the other hand, some companies are well-managed. If one wishes to purchase their shares, they are often unattainable even at a price higher than that offered by stockbrokers. Conversely, there are no buyers if one wishes to sell. This is because, if shares have a public market, their market price often changes rapidly depending on the company's business situation. Before a company's business is on track, changes in the share market can easily lead to unforeseen disadvantages for the company. The fact that company shares are not publicly traded is also due to unavoidable circumstances.</p>
<p>The situation for company shares is already like this. Let us now consider company bonds. The raising of company funds is motivated by two reasons. One is to develop new businesses. Increasing capital is feared to increase permanent burdens, so bonds must be issued to meet temporary funding needs. The other is a lack of funds. Adding shares is difficult, so issuing bonds is the only option. Regardless of how the company bonds are used, they are ultimately secured by the company's assets for principal and interest. If the public has deep trust in its assets, then increasing capital by adding shares is easy, and issuing bonds is also easy. Without this trust, bonds cannot be raised. Although some company bond issues are completed in no time, their position is different. Their operations have their own advantages, enabling them to gain public trust.</p>
<p>Since the financial industry experienced an accident, depositors have been deeply anxious. Hoarding cash is unprofitable, and there are no channels for investment. As a result, the adventurous tend towards speculation, while the prudent, mindful of the timely payment of principal and interest on various bonds in recent years, use their savings to purchase bonds. As a result, various industries are depressed, while only the securities market flourishes. Although bond prices sometimes weaken, they are bound to rise again. This is because they maintain their creditworthiness and gain public trust. Moreover, the security for bonds is customs duties, which are generally considered the most reliable form of security. If the security for the principal and interest of various bonds were not customs duties but marketable securities such as shares, and of various types, it would be difficult to gain the same level of public trust.</p>
<p>Observing various figures, the lack of silver reserves is a fact. However, if no effort is made to remedy this, it will not only remain lacking but will eventually be depleted. From another perspective, Chinese idle capital is suffering from a lack of safe havens. Much of it even flows into foreign banks and hides overseas. If this idle capital could be used in industry and commerce and kept within domestic banks, it would greatly benefit industry and commerce. However, how can we prevent it from fleeing and make it available for our use? This depends on the efforts of those who wish to utilize it. The way to do this is not difficult. The key is to abandon selfish secrecy and make the content of the business public in order to gain public trust. However, if companies cannot reveal their true situation to the world, then finding self-generated rescue plans will inevitably rely on thorough investigation and careful auditing. This is what is meant by seeking the next best option out of necessity. It is said that in the world of commercial warfare, deception is unavoidable. But it is not known that doing business is not comparable to conducting military operations. In military operations, deception is used, making the empty appear full and the full appear empty, showing people the unpredictable. However, in industry and commerce, except for technical aspects where secrecy should sometimes be strictly maintained, matters that can be made public in business should be revealed truthfully so that the public has room for assessment. Over time, their credibility will become firm. I believe that the greatest reform today is to abandon self-interest and do one's best within oneself, being strict with oneself and lenient with others. Then there may be hope for a turnaround in business.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Methods for Mediating the Italian-Abyssinian Dispute: Italy Expresses Acceptance, Not Exceeding Mussolini's Demands, Several Points of the Draft Resolution Still Need Modification, No Problem for the League of Nations to Pass It <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations is currently working to find a solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and its own fate is almost tied to this effort. Late yesterday, Eden (England), Laval (France), and Aloisi (Italy) broke the deadlock and agreed on a draft resolution, which was immediately telegraphed to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. His approval or disapproval will be decided by Mussolini this morning. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The draft resolution to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, agreed upon last night by British cabinet member Eden, French Premier Laval, and Italian representative Aloisi, has now been accepted by Italy. Therefore, the proposal is certain to pass at the League of Nations Council meeting. Prime Minister Mussolini's reply telegram regarding the compromise draft arrived here today, with slight modifications, but they will not cause difficulties. Therefore, the reply is tantamount to acceptance. It is believed that if there are no objections to the mediation process, the modifications requested by Mussolini all relate to subsequent steps. After studying Mussolini's reply telegram with experts today, Italian representative Aloisi and French Premier Laval immediately sent the original text to British representative Eden and Abyssinian representative Haile Selassie. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations this morning postponed its intervention in the Italian-Abyssinian dispute until mid-September. The United Kingdom, France, and Italy have agreed on a compromise plan, which is generally seen as a victory for Italy. This plan restores the work of the League of Nations arbitration committee within the scope of Mussolini's demands. Once Italy agrees tomorrow, the League of Nations will notify Abyssinia of this plan. If Abyssinia can accept it sooner, the Council may be able to formally pass it on Friday evening. According to this plan, French Prime Minister Laval, British representative Eden, and Italian representative Aloisi reached an agreement after repeated meetings within 24 hours. During the secret meetings, the three tried to avoid any measures opposed by Mussolini, and as a result, they agreed on two compromise methods: first, regarding the scope of the arbitration negotiations; second, regarding the fundamental procedures for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Yesterday, when the three statesmen considered the French draft containing Eden's amendments, there was a significant divergence of opinions between Britain and Italy. Britain refused to accept the two opposing suggestions made by Italy regarding the draft: one concerning the provision that Italy should not resort to force during the negotiations, and the other concerning Abyssinia's participation in the negotiations of the signatory countries to the 1906 treaty, namely Britain, France, and Italy. Britain insisted on Eden's amendments. Later, Eden, Laval, and Aloisi worked hard to communicate their opinions. The main difficulty at that time was Italy's insistence that the League of Nations Council should not be involved in the negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy. The three representatives finally agreed on a compromise: deleting the mutually contested clauses regarding the League of Nations' involvement in the three-country negotiations, and leaving this matter to be decided separately by the three countries. The three countries will formally declare their readiness to negotiate with the relevant fourth party in the spirit of the 1906 treaty. This method satisfies Britain in substance and Italy in form. However, everything now depends entirely on Mussolini's decision. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e23">British, French, and Italian Representatives Agree on Draft Resolution: Contains Four Points <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval, and Italian representative Aloisi held talks at the French delegation office from 7:15 PM to 8:20 PM. The contents of the draft resolution of the League of Nations Council were discussed and agreed upon. Then, experts jointly drafted the text of the resolution. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy agreed on the draft resolution of the League of Nations Council, Italian representative Aloisi consulted Italian Prime Minister Mussolini by telephone. At 4:00 PM, Aloisi informed French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval of Mussolini's opinion. Laval then held talks with Eden. As a result, the Council meeting originally scheduled for 5:00 PM this afternoon was postponed to tomorrow. It is reported that the measures in the draft resolution agreed upon by the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are divided into the following items: (1) The Council appoints a fifth neutral arbitrator to agree with the arbitrators of Italy and Abyssinia to establish a reconciliation method before September 1, in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the 1928 Italian-Abyssinian arbitration treaty. (2) The Council acknowledges that the Walwal border issue is not within the jurisdiction of the arbitration committee. (3) The United Kingdom, France, and Italy, which signed the 1906 treaty on Abyssinia, should immediately begin negotiations to seek a solution that guarantees good relations between Italy and Abyssinia with the Abyssinian government. (4) The League of Nations Council should reconvene on September 4, and reports should be submitted by all parties concerned. It is said that Italy has generally accepted the above points. In addition, the United Kingdom advocates that the resolution should stipulate that Italy and Abyssinia agree not to resort to force during the negotiations. Mussolini is not opposed to this point, but believes that the existing treaties are sufficient to guarantee that armed conflict will not occur after the failure of negotiations. Therefore, the resolution only states that Italy and Abyssinia agree to abide by the provisions of existing treaties in the event of a breakdown in negotiations. The biggest difficulty in the current negotiations lies in the issue of the League of Nations' mission. Britain and France both advocate that the three signatory countries to the 1906 treaty should negotiate a way to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute within the framework of the League of Nations, while Italy opposes any form of intervention by the League of Nations. No agreement has yet been reached on this matter. Although Laval has made every effort to mediate, Italian representative Aloisi has recently informed Laval that Mussolini will not reply tonight. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The key points of the reconciliation plan created by the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy after a long negotiation last night have been revealed to the world through discussions between League of Nations representatives and journalists this morning. This place is now quietly waiting for Italy's reply, and it is expected that there will be no more changes. This is because the compromise reached by Aloisi with Eden and Laval is not inconsistent with the instructions he received from Mussolini. The compromise plan is to entrust the fifth arbitration committee to continue its work, but only to examine the Walwal incident and not to discuss border issues. The arbitration work must be completed before the end of September. As for other matters, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy should discuss solutions through diplomatic channels based on the 1906 Three-Power Treaty. If Italy can accept this plan, the three-country meeting will be held in Italy next week. The location is approximately Vatican Termiglia. The reservation regarding the League of Nations Council's intervention in the entire Italian-Abyssinian issue has been abandoned. However, Italy must sign a gentleman's agreement with the United Kingdom and France, preparing to discuss the Abyssinian issue at the next Council meeting. Whether Abyssinia will be invited has not yet been decided. Once Italy's formal reply is received, the full text of the resolution to be proposed in the League of Nations will be formally notified to the Abyssinian authorities. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>

It is believed that his purpose is to provide the League of Nations with moral assistance from the United States. He said, "At this time when the Council of the League of Nations is meeting to consider how to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute peacefully, I would like to express the hope of the United States, both government and people, that the League of Nations will find a peaceful solution to maintain peace."

<p>Addis Ababa: The official circles here are very calm on the surface regarding the progress of the Geneva negotiations, but it is noteworthy that they believe the League of Nations trusteeship proposal is aimed at dealing with Italy. The Abyssinian government firmly believes that this plan will not be approved by Italy, because Italy hopes to monopolize East Africa. Therefore, defense works should continue to be carried out in preparation for the Italian army's attack. Thousands of troops passed through the capital yesterday and set off northward, but they were not allowed to enter the city, in order to avoid the attention of reporters and the diplomatic community. The government is now doing its best to promote self-defense among the people. Two group exercises were held yesterday. The first was convened by the Patriotic Youth League, and its mission was to instill the principles of colonial warfare in the rural people. The second was convened by Abyssinian women. Some women even carried weapons. At the women's meeting, speeches were given to encourage women to live and die with men. However, these speeches were not of a nature that fostered hatred of foreigners. A total of 83,000 yuan was donated at the two meetings. At the same time, the government is preparing for the capital's air defenses to avoid air raids. The entire city is divided into two parts, and some foreigners have voluntarily taken on the task of training Addis Ababa police. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Reuters has learned from reliable sources that if war breaks out in North Africa, Abyssinia will build dams to block the Webi Shebeli River and other rivers. It has been found that these rivers originate in Abyssinia and flow into Somalia. Military experts from Belgium who have experience in the Great War can turn the rivers into deserts, preventing the Italian army from advancing along the waterways. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa, Abyssinia: "Voice of Abyssinia," the only daily newspaper here, which is popular and printed in "Amharic" (the name of a central region of Abyssinia), recently published an article, saying, "If Abyssinia's policy is wavering, it will increase Italy's intention to invade. We want peace, but we can only achieve it by adopting an unyielding attitude. In short, if Italy advocates peace, we are prepared to listen to it. On the other hand, if it is belligerent and warlike, we will not hesitate to deal with it." Currently, the Abyssinian people are waiting for the resolution of the League of Nations Council with a calm attitude. Speeches are given daily in 40 churches in the capital and its suburbs. Every Sunday, patriotic organizations gather everywhere to give speeches. All this proves the enthusiasm of the Abyssinian people's patriotic psychology. Before going to work every day, young people and most civil servants in the capital do walking exercises on the streets in the morning. In addition, women's organizations help the committee, donate money to support the soldiers. People across the country donate generously, and many celebrities even sell jewelry and donate the proceeds to the public. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira, who returned to the country on the 2nd, entered the Imperial Palace and paid respects to Prince Chichibu at 3:00 PM on the same day to explain the situation of his return. He then went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Foreign Minister Hirota, reported his return, and also presented an important report, based on the report co-signed by Yamamoto Isoroku, a representative who had returned to the country, on the London naval preparatory consultations and their contents. He also reported on the latest situation regarding European naval issues, centering on the Anglo-German naval agreement, which had been discovered since the establishment of Baldwin's new British cabinet, as well as the content and results of the Paris ambassador conference, and made important suggestions on the above matters. (Jiji News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Matsudaira visited Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice Minister Shigemitsu at 2:30 PM this afternoon. Matsudaira reported to Foreign Minister Hirota that the British Conservative Party's policy towards Japan was still a friendly policy. The US policy toward China is to maintain its vested interests in China and uphold the interests of the British people. It is willing to discuss these policies with Japan and implement its goals. He also reported on the conclusions and suggestions of the Paris Conference of Ambassadors and the Ottawa Conference of Ambassadors. The issue of disarmament only confirmed the proposal jointly made by Yamamoto and Matsudaira. Detailed details have not yet been raised. It is heard that Ambassador Matsudaira will go to Hayama to see the Emperor on the 5th. (Chinese Allied Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Yokohama: Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira and his family arrived in Yokohama on the morning of the 2nd aboard the Heian Maru. Important figures such as Imperial Representative Prince Chichibu (Ambassador Matsudaira is Prince Chichibu's father-in-law), Tokugawa Iesato, Hayashi Gonsuke, and Matsuoka Yosuke came to the pier to welcome them. Ambassador Matsudaira told reporters that Britain's attitude towards Japan was very tough after the September 18th Incident, but recently, its understanding of Japan has deepened, and therefore its attitude has also changed greatly. Regarding the naval disarmament issue, Britain understands Japan's position quite well, and knows that the method of disarmament using the ratio system is unreasonable and may hurt Japan's feelings. Therefore, it now wants to change its disarmament method. During the preparatory consultation last year, there was no opposition to Japan's proposal for equality among the three countries, but recently, they have gradually understood the situation on the Japanese side. Britain originally planned to convene a disarmament conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan this year, but if there is no hope for a satisfactory conclusion to the conference, there is no need to hold a meeting. After the establishment of the Anglo-German naval agreement, the attitudes of France and Italy have also become more complicated. With such a complex European political situation, it is doubtful whether the disarmament issue can be resolved. (Jiji News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) During today's meeting in the Lower House, the opposition party initiated a debate on foreign affairs. Foreign Secretary Hoare issued a warning, saying, "One of the most difficult problems in the world today is the disparity in the situation of countries, with some having vast jurisdictions such as colonies, and others having none."</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also made an important announcement, saying that after Parliament adjourns tomorrow, the Speaker has the right to convene a meeting of the Lower House upon the Prime Minister's request. This procedure will be taken if a serious incident occurs. Today, opposition leader Lansbury asked to hold two major world conferences: (1) a disarmament conference aimed at abolishing air warfare; (2) to reconvene an economic mediation conference.</p>
<p>Lansbury continued to discuss the Abyssinian issue, saying that the government would bear the obligations under the League of Nations Covenant for a long time, and Labor Party members would support it, but not by asking Britain to act alone. Liberal Party leader Samuel then claimed that he believed that if the United Kingdom, France, and Italy jointly handled issues under the 1906 treaty, it would not damage the prestige of the League of Nations. It is rumored that the United Kingdom and France are eager for Italy's cooperation in various matters in China. The guarantees given to Italy by the United Kingdom and France have tied their own hands. The government should clarify these claims. In his reply, the Foreign Secretary expressed great satisfaction with the United States' condemnation of any resort to force. He continued to say that the British government was well aware of the obligations under various treaties and the League of Nations Covenant and was determined to maintain them. After the Foreign Secretary spoke of the problems caused by countries with and without colonies, he said that the way to solve this matter was not to resort to force but to consult. He then spoke of the world conference, saying that if it was not properly prepared, it would make people nervous. The World Economic Conference still exists, and the United Kingdom may rely on it again in the future. Britain initiated the abolition of air warfare as early as March 1933. Now, without Germany's cooperation, this matter cannot be discussed. At present, the opinions of France and Germany on the issue of disarmament are still far apart. Finally, he said that if war breaks out in East Africa, whether Italy or Abyssinia wins, the damage to the League of Nations will be unimaginable. From then on, disputes and controversies will follow one after another without end. Britain and its French friends have, for generations, aimed to build bridges between Europe and Africa and between Europe and Asia. Britain's sympathy for Italy is not just empty words. If Italy is dissatisfied with Abyssinia, it can raise it in a proper manner. (Cheers) This dispute does not need to be resolved by resorting to force. Once the war breaks out, it will plunge Europe into chaos, the forces of peace will be greatly weakened, and the vast colored peoples of the world will be horrified and uneasy. At this point, the Foreign Secretary solemnly stated that Britain is now using all kinds of forces to avert the catastrophe. The Foreign Secretary then denied rumors that Britain had allowed Italy to act freely in Abyssinia. The Foreign Secretary concluded, "The state of Europe is still bleak and terrible. We must consider our own strength again and again, so that Britain can be strong enough to maintain a firm policy of peace and be respected by all countries in the world." (Cheers) (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(London) Although the international situation is rather bleak, the British Parliament adjourned today in high spirits for the summer. The number of unemployed people in the country has now continued to decline, and the business situation has also improved, especially in the steel industry. The trade statistics for the first six months of this year are particularly encouraging. The banknotes circulating in British banks are often an indicator of public prosperity and credit reliability. According to the bank's report, the total number circulating this week is 19,000,000 pounds more than in the same week last year. The number of unemployed last month, according to informal sources, was 1,970,000. This is particularly welcome, because July is usually a slow month for industry, and the number of unemployed often increases. It was found that one month after the national unity government took office, the number of unemployed reached as many as 2,852,772. The number of steel exports in July also increased significantly. According to a report from Middlesbrough, it increased by more than 30% compared to June. The increase in refined steel was even greater, reaching 26,647 tons, an increase of 10,000 tons compared to the previous month. This is due to the demand in many parts of the world, especially in South Africa, Finland, India, China, and Argentina. At the same time, many manufacturers are now engaged in manufacturing cold-rolled steel sheets for the motor industry. This product was previously a specialty of the United States. The Southern Railway and the Northeastern Railway are now planning to extend their lines and electrify the railways, which will cost millions of pounds. Exports for the first half of 1935 were worth 206,000,000 pounds. It was found that the same month last year was 189,000,000 pounds. The import surplus has decreased from 142,000,000 pounds to 124,000,000 pounds. During the same period, the issuance of new company stocks has increased from 69 to 89. At the same time, there are many people in the UK on vacation. Travel by rail, ship, and plane has broken previous records. The railway companies are now planning to add 1,000 trains at the end of the week for vacationers to use by the sea. The number of sleeping car berths ordered from Ostend has reached 4,000, and the number of train seats has reached 13,000. The number of people going to and from domestic and European resorts is higher than at any time since 1929. There is also a new record for those who travel by private plane. Hungary is a popular destination for the masses. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

He then addressed the branch staff regarding his new position, saying, "In order to fulfill the mission of Mantetsu, there is no other way but to work together. He advocated cooperation with Yuan, with many encouraging words. Finally, regarding his future ambitions, he spoke as follows: "Mantetsu will not touch political issues or anything else in the future. We will only strive to advance economic activities. This is an era where it is necessary to do so. Mantetsu is different from the domestic railways. Its mission is to fully implement railway policy. Therefore, it is imperative to make the economic strength of Manchurian farmers extremely abundant. As for focusing only on Manchurian cities and trying to promote manufacturing industries, it is a big mistake. Doing so would not only waste domestic capital but also oppress domestic industries to some extent, and it would be of great benefit to Manchurian farmers. The same situation applies to North China. It is imperative to find ways to stabilize the lives of farmers. Regarding the new lineup of Mantetsu, the appointment of a vice president has not yet been decided. As for the improvement of personnel matters, it is not yet known to what extent it can be started.

<p>(San Francisco) The famous American long-distance aviator Post, accompanied by his wife, departed by plane today, planning to cross the top of the world to reach Moscow. This one-eyed aviator is now making a non-stop flight to Seattle. However, floats are installed under the plane to cross the Bering Sea. After arriving in Moscow, Mr. and Mrs. Post will go to the swimming island and Greenland and then return to the United States. The purpose of this trip is to measure the sky routes between Alaska and Siberia for commercial airlines, seeking a shortcut to connect Europe and America. Post is currently flying a new-style Lockheed low-wing single-engine aircraft. (1st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The famous Soviet Russian aviator, Captain Levonevsky, recently plans to fly through the Arctic to reach the United States. Professor Shmidt, Director of the Northern Shipping Administration, recently spoke on this plan, saying, "If this flight plan can be completed, then based on the reports obtained along the way, and with detailed research, it will not be difficult to establish a regular airmail route between Russia and the United States via the Arctic. As for preparing for this flight, the most important thing is climate reports along the way. Good weather is a necessary condition for flying over the Arctic. The weight of the aircraft to be used this time will be reduced to the lowest possible level, but its total weight will still reach eleven tons, because the aircraft carries 7,200 liters of gasoline and 500 liters of engine oil, which weighs six tons. Therefore, the aircraft must fly low when taking off to be effective. The most worrying danger along the way is the problem of icing on the outside of the wings. At present, there is no equipment to avoid this danger. In addition, the crew carries enough food for three months, so that if the aircraft is forced to land in the Arctic, the crew will not be cut off from food. In addition, an icebreaker will take care of it near the Arctic to prevent emergencies. The aircraft used this time is the same as the aircraft that created the round-the-world flight record in 1934. This record is 11,000 kilometers, but in theory, it can fly 30,000 kilometers." According to reports, the departure date of the aircraft has not yet been determined and will depend on the weather. It may depart this afternoon or at night. It is not yet certain whether foreign reporters will be able to visit the airfield at that time. (1st Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying talked about the German reporter Miller has been released and returned. He has reported to the Chahar Provincial Government the organization of the bandits, the situation of the bandit den, and the experience of being kidnapped. The bandits pretended to be security teams and wore armbands with the word "Bao" on them, which was obviously impersonation. The Chahar Provincial Government, in order to rescue the British reporter from danger, had previously sent Squad Leader Zhang of the Security Team to lead several soldiers of the Security Team to negotiate with the bandit leader. Because the negotiation did not yield any results, Zhang had returned to Baochang from the bandit den. Now the Chahar Provincial Government sent Squad Leader Zhang, and added two more staff members, to negotiate with the bandit leader again.

The Central Party Headquarters believes that there are a large number of party members who are civil servants. Paying income donations and then paying income tax is an increase in the burden on party members, and the names are similar, which is not conducive to public opinion.

<p>Over 80,000 People and Livestock Drowned - Countless Public and Private Losses</p>
<p>A correspondent in Hankou reports that the flood in Hubei Province was most severe in Tianmen and Hanchuan. The disaster in Tianmen was particularly dire due to its low-lying terrain and intricate network of rivers. The people relied on the dikes for their lives. On July 7th, the Xiang River surged violently, and the 11-bow section of the Xiang River main dike in Zhongxiang County collapsed. The flood rushed directly into the county, rising more than 19 feet overnight, exceeding the highest historical water level by more than 5 feet. On the morning of the 8th, Commissioner and County Magistrate Shi Yuling went to Yuekou to supervise the people in rescuing the Yuekou dike section, which fortunately remained safe. However, the Shuanghe Dyke, 15 miles downstream of Yuekou, ultimately collapsed late at night amidst wind and rain, extending to 72 embankments, all of which were breached. The 72 embankments, surrounding over a hundred miles, encompassing areas of Tianmen, Mianyang, and Jingling counties, were all submerged. At the same time, the county river's water level continued to rise. The commissioner's office and all its staff, along with the security team and local organizations, desperately tried to rescue the city walls, increasing their height and thickness, hoping to preserve the county town. Unexpectedly, by 8:00 AM on the 9th, the water level became increasingly fierce, and the city walls immediately overflowed and collapsed, flooding the city higher than the crenellations. When the dike collapsed, more than a dozen security team soldiers and civilians who were rescuing the dike were washed away, and the rest had nowhere to go. When the flood entered the city, the West Gate bore the brunt of the impact. Some 300 families had their people, houses, and belongings washed away, some had their houses washed away but some people survived, and some had their houses remaining but their people were annihilated. In an instant, the entire city was submerged. Except for the north and south city towers and the top of the ancient city dike outside the North Gate, all institutions, schools, blockhouses, and barracks were either completely destroyed or severely damaged. Seven or eight tenths of the city walls collapsed. The roofs of the commissioner's office could be navigated by boat. In the rural areas, the eighth district was the worst affected. Hundreds of towns and villages, such as Huiputou City, were completely destroyed, and livestock, grain, clothing, and other items were washed away. Subsequent investigations revealed the following losses: (1) The disaster area covered approximately 6,300 square miles, accounting for seven-eighths of the county's area. (2) The affected population was approximately 124,000 households, totaling 643,000 people, accounting for eight-tenths of the county's population. (3) The flooded farmland accounted for 1.4 million mu out of the county's total of 1.79 million mu, representing eight-tenths of the total. (4) Over 16,000 houses collapsed, and approximately 40,000 houses were submerged but not yet evacuated. (5) The number of deaths due to drowning was highest in the first, eighth, fifth, and twenty-fourth districts, with approximately 12,000 people. (6) Over 28,000 head of cattle, 32,000 pigs, and 5,500 horses were drowned. (7) Approximately 350,000 dan of washed-away grains, beans, and wheat. (8) 130,000 dan of unharvested cotton, over 700,000 shi of soybeans, and over 800,000 shi of rice. (9) Public losses included over 300 miles of telephone lines erected over the years, running vertically and horizontally, and over 500 miles of county and district roads built over the years. In this flood, the telegraph poles, wires, bridges, and roadbeds were all washed away completely. Other public buildings, such as the commissioner's office, Confucian temple, various institutions, school buildings, and newly built blockhouses, and repaired city walls, were also destroyed. When news of the county's disaster arrived, it was said that no less than 100,000 people had drowned. According to a detailed investigation, 80,000 people have been rescued, but the water has not yet receded, and the disaster victims have nowhere to shelter, facing hunger and disease. If relief is delayed, they will ultimately perish. (August 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Summer Season Gradually Passes: Business Declines in Guling <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>--Vacant Houses for Rent Are Everywhere--</p>
<p>A correspondent from Guling reports that Mount Lu is vast and majestic, with tranquil scenery, embracing rivers and lakes, and convenient transportation. The mountain rises over 4,000 feet above sea level, and the summer temperature is often around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, making it a popular summer resort for Chinese and foreigners. Mount Lu spans over 500 li, with Guling as its center. The usual resident population is only three to four thousand, but it increases to forty to fifty thousand during the summer. Especially after 1930, important central figures often came to discuss national affairs, and dignitaries gathered, adding to its prosperity. Last year, the demand for houses in the mountains exceeded supply, and hotels and shops were making several times their usual profits. For example, the Lujinfang, Jiaotong, Qingliang, and Yuntian hotels earned profits exceeding ten thousand for the most successful, and at least several thousand for the less so. However, with the summer season almost over this year, vacant houses for rent are still everywhere, the streets are deserted, and business is less than three-tenths of what it was last year. The reasons are: (1) The cost of living on Mount Lu is very high. For those staying in hotels, a minimum living expense of two yuan per person per day is unavoidable. Those who travel around the mountains by sedan chair need at least eight yuan a day. In this period of economic decline, there are very few who can afford such extravagance. (2) The Yangtze River area has been severely flooded, and business is in decline. The compradors from Yichang, Shashi, and Hankou, who used to come to the mountains to escape the heat, are also fewer in number this year. (3) Many of those who used to come from Nanjing, Shanghai, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to escape the heat have switched to Qingdao and Beidaihe. For these reasons, the business of Mount Lu, including major stores and hotels, has been greatly affected. (July 29th)</p>

<p>German Journalist Returns Safely to Beiping - Details Encounter with Bandits</p>
<p>A Beiping correspondent reports that the British journalist Jones and the German journalist Miller (also translated as Mi and Bai), who were kidnapped by bandits in Baochang County, eastern Chahar Province, have been rescued due to the strenuous efforts of the Chahar provincial authorities. The German journalist Miller escaped from the bandit den on the 30th of last month. After briefly staying in Baochang and Zhangjiakou, he arrived safely in Beiping this (1st) morning at 7:10 AM, escorted by Zhai Weiqi, an official dispatched by the Chahar Provincial Government. Everyone was delighted by Miller's safe return. The Military Affairs Committee sent Councilor Yang Quanzhong and Special Diplomatic Commissioner Cheng Xigeng to Miller's residence to express their condolences. Miller expressed his infinite gratitude for the enthusiasm of our government authorities in rescuing him. This (1st) noon, he went to the British and German embassies to report on his encounter with the bandits at the same time as the British journalist Jones and his personal escape, and to discuss ways to rescue Jones. He is scheduled to travel to Zhangjiakou tomorrow (2nd). A reporter visited Miller at 3:00 PM this (1st) afternoon, and he recounted his experience of encountering the bandits. The details of his account are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At the Time of the Encounter with Bandits</p>
<p>I (Miller referring to himself) and Mr. Jones departed from Duolun at 10:00 AM on the 27th of last month by automobile to Zhangjiakou. After passing through Huangqidaying and Habaka, the car suddenly malfunctioned in a desert area. We spent the night there. The next morning, after the car was repaired, we continued our journey. At noon, we arrived at Hejiadahuofang Village in Guanmagou. Before the car reached the village, a group of about thirty or forty bandits wearing blue uniforms (similar to the uniforms of the security team) suddenly rushed out from both sides and fired dozens of shots from rifles and machine guns. Two bullets hit the water tank of our car, forcing us to stop.</p>
<p>Confiscation of Property</p>
<p>I (Miller referring to himself) jumped out of the car and asked them why they were shooting and stopping us from moving forward. The bandits replied, "We are the bandit suppression security team." They then invited me into a small house for tea. At that time, I caught a glimpse of the bandits carrying my luggage into the house. I asked them why, and they claimed it was a routine inspection. One of the bandits then put my money into his pocket. I angrily asked if taking people's property was also part of the inspection. The bandit laughed and said, "We are bandits, not the security team. Since you have come, please settle in." The bandits then dragged the British journalist Mr. Jones from the car into another small house and hung him from the beam with a rope. After a while, they brought him back to my room, seemingly to negotiate.</p>
<p>Four Demands</p>
<p>At that time, the room was surrounded by bandits standing guard, holding guns in a ready-to-fire position. The situation was extremely serious. Under these circumstances, the bandits made the following four demands: (1) a ransom of 100,000 yuan; (2) 40 rifles and 20,000 rounds of ammunition; (3) 20 pistols and 20,000 rounds of ammunition; (4) 20 portable machine guns and 20,000 rounds of ammunition. Without discussion, they immediately wrote these four demands on a piece of paper and asked us to sign it, giving us ten days to fulfill them, otherwise they would tear up the ticket. The note was handed to the Russian driver Peter Lixuefu and my servant Liang, who departed from Guanmagou at 3:00 PM and went directly to Baochang County. After the driver and others arrived at their destination, they used the telephone to report to a relative of the driver named Qi in Zhangjiakou, who relayed it to the British Embassy and the German Legation in Beiping. The county magistrate of Baochang also telegraphed the provincial government to report the kidnapping.</p>
<p>Life in the Bandit Den</p>
<p>Until the evening of the 29th, after the British and German embassies received the phone call from Zhangjiakou, they dispatched personnel on the morning of the 30th to leave Beiping at 6:00 AM and arrive in Zhangjiakou at 2:00 PM to handle the rescue. While we were trapped in the bandit den, we were treated well, so we did not suffer significant mental trauma. However, Jones was frightened because it was his first encounter, while I found it to be the most interesting event of my life, as life in the bandit den had its own unique charm. After the driver and Liang left Guanmagou and headed south on the 28th, Jones and I, under the coercion of the bandits, with our hands tied behind our backs, rode horses north, moving from place to place. It can be seen that the bandits were not familiar with the geography, as they circled left and right but still did not leave the territory of Baochang County. On the 29th, we finally moved to Yemqi. Although we were moved around haphazardly, fortunately, we were not lacking in food and drink.</p>
<p>Rescue Situation</p>
<p>On that day, Zhang Yunjie, a platoon leader of the security team, along with three policemen, came to negotiate. The bandits first fired at Zhang, who indicated that he was unarmed with a white towel. The bandits sent someone to talk to Zhang. Zhang took out a letter from the team headquarters as proof of his identity. Unexpectedly, the bandit leader was illiterate and tore the letter into pieces. He then tied up Zhang and the other three people and brought them to the bandit leader. The bandit leader, whose surname was Ji or Ji (not confirmed), first asked them to release us. The bandit leader, seeing Zhang's bravery and skill, voluntarily offered to concede, reducing the ransom to 50,000 yuan and waiving all other demands.</p>
<p>Escape Experience</p>
<p>On the 30th, after eating together in Kethier, the bandits separated us. My group consisted of six riders (including security team platoon leader Zhang Yunjie and three policemen, two of whom were guides). I initially thought the odds were against us, or that I was going to be shot, but unexpectedly, I arrived safely in Baochang County. Zhang's negotiations with the bandits resulted in my parole so that I could negotiate the ransom with various parties. The bandit leader also said that if the government would allow them to turn over a new leaf, they would be willing to accept amnesty. I arrived in Baochang at noon on the 30th. At 4:00 PM on the 31st, I returned to Zhangjiakou by car and met with Xiao Zhenying, the person in charge of the Chahar Provincial Government, and Miller, the military attache sent by the British Embassy, to discuss ways to rescue Mr. Jones. Mr. Xiao expressed his agreement and promised to use all means of tactful compromise to ensure Jones's safe return.</p>
<p>Jones' Safety</p>
<p>Regarding the safety of Mr. Jones, if effective rescue measures can be taken before the deadline, there should be no cause for concern. According to unofficial news, Jones has already escaped. After inquiring with various parties, this has not been confirmed. However, I hope that the rumors are true and offer my sincere prayers. Assuming that Jones is still in the bandit den, I plan to go to Zhangjiakou tomorrow (2nd) to assist in the rescue of my friend in need. If there is still no solution, then I will go to Baochang and return to the bandit den to share life and death with Jones, to fulfill my moral obligation. The Chinese government has provided sincere assistance to us in this incident, and I have boundless admiration. (August 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Guangdong Province: Second Major Flood in the Dong River <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Heyuan and Zhaoqing Experience a Sudden Rise of Over Ten Feet - Huilai Experiences Flash Floods, Destroying All Fields</p>
<p>A Guangzhou correspondent reports that Guangdong Province's West River recently suffered a major flood, and the disaster situation in counties such as Guangning, Sihui, Gaoming, and Gaoyao was extremely severe. The counties are currently handling local disaster relief. In addition to the government allocating 1,000 yuan to each county and the Renai Charitable Hall distributing over 10,000 jin of rice, the Renai Charitable Hall recently resolved to allocate 40,000 yuan in relief funds to assist the disaster victims in Guangning and Sihui counties. However, just as the West River's situation was improving, the East River flooded again. The East River had already experienced a major flood before the West River disaster, causing significant losses along the river. It was thought that after the East River had receded, the West River would flood, and the East River would be spared a second flood. Unexpectedly, misfortunes never come singly. Starting on July 21st, the East River experienced continuous strong winds and heavy rain, and the river level suddenly rose by over ten feet, causing flooding along the East River basin again. In Heyuan County, the city was flooded starting on the 25th. In the city's Taiping Road and Hualong Bridge areas, the water was over five feet deep on the ground. Residents' furniture was floating everywhere, and countless livestock were drowned. The embankments of Laolong Town in Longchuan were also submerged. The roadbed of the Guanghe section of the second provincial highway in the eastern district was submerged, and the Waxi Bridge on the Zijing-Wuhua section of the third highway (from Huizhou to Xingning) was destroyed. Traffic was suspended on the 25th. Downstream, in counties such as Huiyang and Boluo, the river level also rose at the same time. In Huiyang, the water level rose by more than nine feet in areas such as Sandu, Pingshan, Pingtan, and Xinxu. Below Pingshan, areas such as Mahuang Temple, Niuxu, Shanchang Street, Shaibu Chang in Huicheng, Xiamei Street, and Tangxia were all knee-deep in water. Boluo, located downstream, anticipated a second flood due to the upstream flooding. Currently, farmers are rushing to harvest the rice day and night, fearing that the flood will submerge everything, leaving no grain left. Therefore, crowds gather in the fields day and night to harvest, creating a chaotic scene. In Huilai County, located northeast of Huiyang, torrential rains have continued for the past ten days, causing flash floods this month. The water in the county's fourth district is over ten feet deep, sweeping away all the rice and crops, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. The fourth district chief and others have submitted a request to the county government for relief, stating in the petition: "A petition is submitted to request relief to comfort the disaster victims. The area under my jurisdiction is low-lying, and the Longxi River runs through the middle. The river is shallow and narrow, with sand and gravel accumulating, causing frequent floods and droughts. The agricultural villages have already fallen into bankruptcy. Selling sons and daughters is a common occurrence. However, Heaven has not been kind and has brought down another calamity. Starting on the 6th of this month, heavy rains have poured down without stopping day or night, causing flash floods. The water on the ground is over ten feet deep, turning all the fields into a watery land. All the rice crops, which were bearing fruit and about to ripen, were suddenly submerged and completely destroyed for six days and nights. At this time of devastation in the villages, another major flood has occurred. Early rice crops have been lost, and the means of livelihood have been cut off. Rice prices have soared in recent days, and wails of anguish can be heard everywhere. The voices of people crying for food are unbearable to hear. I, as a representative of the people's will, am heartbroken by what I have witnessed. The disaster situation is so severe that I cannot bear to keep it from your attention. Therefore, I respectfully submit this document detailing the disaster situation for your examination and approval. I humbly request that you forward this to the higher authorities to seek relief and comfort the disaster victims. Upon submission, I am at a loss for words to express my heartfelt entreaty."

<p>——Many Spectators Observed During Transfer Through Guixi——</p>
<p>A Guixi correspondent reports that after the Jiangxi communist leader Fang Zhimin was captured and escorted to Nanchang last year, his wife, Song Damei, continued to lead the remnants of the communist forces to raid and disturb various places in northwestern Fujian. After repeated searches and suppressions by the garrison troops, they were gradually eliminated. Fang's wife was also captured recently. The Resident Commissioner's Office in Fujian has now received orders to transfer Fang's wife to the Pacification Commissioner's Office in Nanchang to handle the case together. At 11:00 AM on July 29th, she was escorted to Guixi Station by a long-distance bus on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Highway. At the time, it caused a sensation throughout the city. Thousands of people flocked to see Fang's wife's face. Fang's wife is about thirty years old, with short hair, wearing a white silk shirt, a black silk skirt, a wristwatch on her arm, black socks, and black shoes. Although she had a weathered face, her eyes were sharp and bright. Under the watchful eyes of thousands, she appeared unaffected. At noon, the bus drove straight to Nanchang. (30th)</p>

<p>—Provisional Measures for Exchanging Silver Dollars—</p>
<p>A Qingdao correspondent reports that the Qingdao Municipal Government has formulated five provisional measures for citizens to exchange silver dollars in order to prevent the export of silver and maintain the city's financial stability. These measures are intended to restrict the exchange of silver and prevent unscrupulous individuals from secretly transporting it out of the city. A notice has been issued to all government agencies and the public to inform them of these measures. The notice and the measures for exchanging silver dollars are listed below:</p>
<p>Municipal Government Notice</p>
<p>It has been found that our country uses silver as its main currency. Sufficient silver reserves ensure convenient circulation and a sound economy. However, since the price of silver has increased, exporting silver has become highly profitable. Therefore, incidents of exchanging banknotes for silver dollars and secretly transporting them out of various places have been occurring from time to time. This government has repeatedly received clear orders from the central government to prohibit such activities and has issued orders to strictly investigate and ban them. In the past, merchants, both Chinese and foreign, in this city have been able to consider the overall situation, and there have been few such incidents. However, recently, the number of silver dollars exchanged by banks daily has gradually increased, indicating that there are unscrupulous individuals attempting to transport them out of the city secretly. If this outflow is allowed to continue unchecked, it will not only affect the financial stability of this city and hinder trade between Chinese and foreign merchants, causing harm to both Chinese and foreign merchants, but it will also lead to the collapse of the national economy, endangering the foundation of the country. Therefore, it is necessary to strictly prevent this from happening and eliminate this hidden danger. The following five provisional measures for banks and money shops in Qingdao to exchange silver dollars are hereby formulated and will be implemented from the date of promulgation in order to maintain the market. In addition to issuing this notice by this government and sending it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it is hereby copied and sent to you for your information. This order is issued.</p>
<p>Measures for Exchange</p>
<p>(1) In Qingdao City, these measures are formulated to alleviate the impact of silver outflow on financial stability. (2) When people exchange banknotes at banks, the banks should first provide yuan notes for circulation. If there is a need to use silver dollars, they may provide a limited amount of silver dollars, but the number should not exceed ten yuan per person. (3) If merchants need to exchange a large amount of silver dollars for legitimate purposes, they should declare the purpose. After the Chamber of Commerce verifies and approves it, the government will notify the bank to exchange the silver dollars accordingly. (4) These measures must be implemented by all Chinese and foreign merchants in this city. The Municipal Government will notify the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Money Shop Guilds to inform their members to comply with the measures. It will also ask the consuls of various countries stationed in Qingdao to notify their merchants to comply. (5) These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation of this notice by the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Songjiang: Township Head Retains Queue, Ordered to Cut It Off</p>
<p>This county has received orders to organize township heads, gather them in Songjiang, and provide them with knowledge of the baojia system. All districts have been able to strictly comply with the orders and diligently implement them. However, Feng Luyuan, the head of the fourth bao of the Puhua Township in the sixth district of Peinan, secretly asked someone to replace him after reporting for duty. This was discovered by the county government, which immediately summoned the township head for reprimand. It was also found that the township head was still wearing a queue coiled inside his hat. He was severely reprimanded and ordered to have his queue cut off in the court by the police.</p>
<h3 id="e85">A Glimpse of Summer Hygiene Work <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The County Public Security Bureau, regarding public health in the urban and rural areas and road cleaning as particularly important during this summer season, followed provincial orders to organize a hygiene committee. The bureau chief, district chief, and head of the hygiene section serve as ex officio members, and local figures Cai Zhongyu, Zhu Jiuwang, and Du Gui were hired as members. The committee has been established. In addition to the original street cleaners from the district office continuing to serve, the committee hired ten additional street cleaners to work together. A portion of their work includes removing melon rinds and filth from city rivers, banning open-air latrines, and donating funds to purchase and prepare "ke fa sha" (heatstroke relief) medicine. They entrusted the First District Office to distribute four bottles per "jia" (a neighborhood unit) to the "jia" head's office, for the needs of each household within the "jia." Currently, the committee's work is quite active.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Appealing to the Ministry of Finance to Implement Currency Reform</p>
<p>The local guilds of wine and soy sauce shops, tobacco retailers, the tobacco industry, restaurants, and other related businesses, noting the prevalence of copper coins in the county market and the soaring price of silver dollars (each dollar can be exchanged for approximately 3,600 cash coins, a difference of over 800 cash coins compared to the previous rate of 2,800 cash coins per dollar), submitted a petition. The guilds, consisting of small-capital shops, pay for goods in silver dollars but receive cash coins for sales. Given the current economic decline in rural areas and the sluggish business conditions, they find it difficult to raise prices, resulting in significant losses. If no relief measures are taken, a collapse is feared. Recently, the Ministry of Finance specially organized a currency system research committee, which decided to adopt a decimal system with ten "jiao" (dimes) equaling one yuan (dollar) and ten "fen" (cents) equaling one "jiao." It was also decided to mint new subsidiary coins made of nickel and antimony in denominations of 5 li, 1 fen, 2 fen, 1 jiao, and 2 jiao. The central mint would produce these coins, and the Central Bank would distribute them to various banks to circulate in the market and support commerce and industry. In this time of commercial crisis, this would be like timely rain after a long drought. The guilds jointly submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting prompt implementation to provide relief and alleviate the distress in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Public Security Bureau Police Affairs Meeting</p>
<p>The Wuyi Public Security Bureau convened a county-wide police affairs meeting on the afternoon of the 1st. Attendees included the heads of various sections within the bureau, as well as the heads of various sub-bureaus, inspectors, and others. The meeting was chaired by Bureau Chief Xu Baoguang. The following resolutions were passed regarding important cases: (1) Registration of domestic dogs and methods for capturing and killing rabid, sick, and stray dogs. It was resolved that rabid and sick dogs should be immediately captured, killed, and buried to prevent harm. The bureau will draft methods for dealing with domestic and stray dogs and submit them to the county and then to the provincial office for review and implementation. (3) Concerning the dangerous practice of riding bicycles on the streets without sufficient skill, it was resolved that bicycle shops would be prohibited from renting bicycles to unskilled riders. All rented bicycles must have lights at night, and violators will be punished. Beat police will be responsible for strict enforcement at all times. (4) It was decided to convene a training session for the secretaries of all sub-bureaus and stations at the bureau on the 6th of this month. (5) It was resolved to strictly prohibit the performance of local operas and gambling in rural teahouses in various townships. Other cases were briefly mentioned.</p>
<p>Nantong: Intensifying Landslide Along the Langshan Riverbank</p>
<p>The landslide along the Nantong riverbank has recently intensified. The Yao Dong riverbank has retreated, having been breached by a large tide for over 300 "zhang" (approximately 1,000 meters), creating a critical situation. People along the river have been conscripted to protect the riverbank day and night. Currently, Langshan Mountain is getting closer to the river. When the high flood season arrives, it will immediately enter the river. Local funds for bank protection are insufficient. The County Construction Committee plans to divert 30,000 yuan from funds raised to rebuild the ancestral hall of the national hero Cao Ding for bank protection purposes. A stone bank will be built and named Cao Gong Dike. At the same time, a telegram will be sent to the provincial and central authorities for subsidies for the project. The Hangzhou city government's riverfront bathing area at Zhakou, covering over ten "mu" (approximately 0.67 hectares), is conveniently located along the car road. The bathing area is surrounded by bamboo fences and small pavilions and has two flat buildings serving as men's and women's changing rooms and toilets. It has been completed. The opening ceremony was held yesterday (the 1st) at 4:00 PM. Over a thousand people attended, including guests from various organizations, swimming enthusiasts Xu Shaodi and Huang Huabiao, the Changfeng Swimming Team, the Boy Scout Summer Camp, and students from the police academy. Mayor Zhou Xiangxian reported on the preparatory process, which cost a total of 2,400 yuan. The performances then began. Over twenty members of the Changfeng team participated, with their formation being orderly and resembling swimming dragons. Thirty members of the Zhejiang Provincial Boy Scout cadre, led by Liuhe Pagoda, arrived and performed water polo and swimming techniques.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Letter: Letter from Zhou Xuewen and Others <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed chief editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to Tang Zhigao's letter of July 27, which was a response to the court's examination of the stolen corpse bones case. His letter, titled "Correction," actually confuses the public. Therefore, we must clearly expose the truth to uphold justice. The Nijiatan (mud altar) is a local public property, with ownership belonging to the local public. In 1915, Songjiang County Magistrate Li Ji and the official in charge of land reclamation, Di, jointly issued a proclamation permanently prohibiting encroachment. No one is allowed to privately hope to take possession of it. This is because the land is where Li Zhigang of the late Ming Dynasty buried his writing tablet, and it has long been respected by local people. However, Tang Zhigao claims that the ownership of the land belongs to the "Jiazi Disaster Memorial Association" and identifies himself as a representative of the memorial association. From this, it is clear that Tang Zhigao and others have long intended to encroach on the altar. The demolition and excavation this time were deliberate actions planned in advance. It should be known that the two title deeds for the altar, referring to the 7 fen and 8.6 li owned by the Yin family and the 6 mu, 1 fen, and 4.8 li owned by the Zhang Shude family (as mentioned in the original letter), include the deed for the Zhang Shude family, which was donated back to the local citizens by Zheng Bocang and others, and was not redeemed by the Memorial Association. How can it be falsely claimed to be owned by the Memorial Association? In 1932, when Zhang Jiecai attempted to seize the altar, a meeting was held at the County Chamber of Commerce, and a public resolution was made to investigate and resist the original plan. At that time, Gu Shisheng was still a representative of Zhang Jiecai and stood against Tang Zhigao. Tang Zhigao ran around appealing to everyone, and presented the deed, saying it would be permanently preserved. Now, the Yin family deed has surfaced, and it turns out that Tang Zhigao and Gu Shisheng have colluded. They have been planning to encroach on and utilize the altar ever since. The Disaster Memorial Association is just a facade. However, the Disaster Memorial Association is a temporary memorial meeting for people affected by war, not a permanent legal institution. Tang Zhigao is the representative of the meeting, also only a temporary representative chosen at the meeting, not a lifetime representative. Then the Disaster Memorial Association itself is like a spark of fire or a flash of lightning, only appearing for a moment. How can Tang Zhigao and others use the name of the association to implement means to seize the Nijiatan? Moreover, both times the Nijiatan was registered, the first time in 1915 by Jiang Shilun and many others, and the second time in 1926 by Yao Jun and ten others, were all local citizens and did not use the name of the Disaster Memorial Association. And Tang Zhigao was also one of those listed in the document. Looking back, it's as clear as yesterday, how can he have forgotten? These are obvious facts, and the public land is officially documented. Tang Zhigao still dares to fabricate and deceive. If he can falsely claim this, what can't he falsely claim? Since the Nijiatan is a public property that is permanently prohibited from encroachment and is not the private property of the Jiazi Disaster Memorial Association, then Tang Zhigao, Yin Shisheng, and two or three other private individuals cannot use the name of the Memorial Association to dispose of the altar. This is very clear. With this in mind, it can be seen that the so-called meeting of directors and supervisors held at the County Chamber of Commerce on September 21, 1934, as mentioned in the original letter, was an infringing act by a few private individuals like Tang Zhigao and cannot reduce their responsibility for encroaching on, destroying, and excavating the altar. Moreover, since the altar had been registered as permanently prohibited from encroachment, anyone who wanted to do anything with it would have to submit it to the competent authorities for approval. Otherwise, it would be a private action, and especially since the event was an intentional encroachment, the act violates the current criminal law. As for the excavated corpses, 31 wooden boxes have been collected, and it was publicly agreed to seal them and choose a date for a joint burial. Why, without waiting for the date, did they hire workers to bury them privately at night? This time, when the prosecutor came to the scene to excavate and inspect, why did the location not match what was indicated? Why were there fewer boxes? Why were some seals there and some not? Why were the bones in the boxes dry and wet? And why was there an empty box? Why doesn't Tang Zhigao explain these doubts one by one to clear up public suspicion? Also, the original letter stated that all expenses, except for the 621 yuan contributed by the Pastor Bu, were raised by the association's colleagues. It is unknown that Pastor Bu's 621 yuan was his celebration money, which Pastor Bu intended to donate to the orphanage as an educational fund. Tang Zhigao violated his wishes and asked someone to find a way to get it to be used for demolishing the pavilion and destroying the tomb. Pastor Bu still feels pained when he talks about it. As for the other expenses, since the soil was sold for money to cover the costs, and the altar could be used to generate income in the future, who wouldn't be happy to temporarily pay for it to gain endless benefits in the future? But they changed the name to fundraising. This is truly what is called "eloquent lies." Furthermore, the original letter said that since the memorial pavilion was planned to be built on the land in 1925, no coffin has ever been buried there, and the burial of wounded soldiers in 1927 is even more of a substitution. According to the information, there were as many as 48 wounded soldiers buried in 1927, and the wounded soldier roster of the Fifth Sanatorium clearly states the date of death, burial date, and location, and it was also reported to the Chinese Red Cross Society headquarters, with records available. Furthermore, the leader of the burial team, Yu Zhanjing, can be questioned. How can they call a deer a horse, and replace things to cover the public's eyes and ears? When the National Revolutionary Army fled from Hangzhou in 1927, Sun Chuanfang retreated to Songjiang. The army of Wu gathered in Songjiang, and when the Zhili-Lu army was redeployed, Bi Shucheng's 37th Brigade, He Dianjia's 39th Brigade, and Deng Xishan all stationed at the station and the infant nursery, while the military police inspection office was stationed at the fire brigade. Therefore, the wounded soldiers buried by the Fifth Sanatorium after the National Revolutionary Army recaptured Songjiang, it happened at this time. Tang Zhigao has not heard of it, and he hastily referred to the transplantation, referring to a shelter as a horse, which is really a muddled head, eye holes like a bean-like view. The above reasons are all facts seen by everyone and consistent public opinion, not personal opinions. We are afraid that the original letter is called a correction, and if it is not revealed, it will be enough to confuse right and wrong. We have stated the facts in detail and ask you to include them in the letter column for public viewing, so that the truth may be known. This is our letter.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhou Xuewen, Chairman of the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Li Xiuzhe, President of the Sijing Branch, and Huang Xiaohe, a citizen of Songjiang.</p>

<p>Postal Contract to be Established Within Days</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway is opened to traffic, transportation in Changshu and Taicang will be very convenient.

(2) Where there are no stations along the route, they will be added at any time as necessary, in order to facilitate passengers. (3) Passengers are allowed 15 kilograms of free luggage. Those over 15 kilograms will be charged one-eighth of the ticket price per 10 kilograms. (4) A fraction of 5 "li" for half the ticket price is counted as 1 "fen."</p>

<p>Regulations for Recruiting Merchant Agents for China Merchants</p>
<p>The regulations for recruiting merchant agents for the Shanghai-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company are as follows: 1. In order to facilitate passengers, the Company has specifically set up agency stations in small towns along the route to provide passengers with stations for getting on and off. The Company recruits local merchants to act as agents. 2. Any store or household living on both sides of the route through which the Company's buses pass who is willing to act as an agent may do so as long as it meets the requirements of these Regulations. 3. If there are more than two people who wish to act as agents in each location, the Company has the right to select and designate them. 4. Anyone who wishes to act as an agent must fill out a voluntary application and find a reputable merchant in the local area or county seat to guarantee everything. They must also pay a deposit of 50 yuan in silver to the Company (this deposit does not accrue interest). If business is booming in the future and the Company deems it necessary to increase the deposit, it shall be complied with. 5. If the agent is a local government agency or organization, it shall appoint a person in charge to handle the business. 6. The agency station established by the agent should have a waiting room large enough to accommodate more than ten people, and must be equipped with tables and chairs for passengers to sit and wait for the bus. 7. The passenger tickets sold at the agency station should be obtained in advance from the Company's designated self-operated station. When the tickets are about to run out, preparations should be made to continue to receive them. However, the amount of tickets received shall not exceed 80% of the amount of the deposit paid. Under no circumstances may the agent print and replace them without permission. Violators will be immediately dismissed. 8. The agent shall fill in the number of passenger tickets sold and the amount of ticket fares in the Company's daily payment report every day, and submit them together with the ticket money to the first bus the next morning. If the payment is delayed by more than one day, 1/10 of the monthly agency fee will be deducted. 9. The agent shall sell tickets daily in the order of the ticket numbers and report the full amount daily. It is not allowed to sell tickets from the middle or sell tickets in reverse order, or report smaller numbers than the actual numbers. If there is any failure to sell in order, intercept and leave ticket money unresolved, the full monthly agency fee for that month will be cancelled. If the circumstances are serious, the agency right will be revoked. 10. When the bus arrives, the agent should collect tickets from passengers. If passengers have not purchased tickets or are riding past the stop, they should be ordered to make up the ticket and hand over the ticket after punching it. The collected waste tickets shall be sorted, numbered, and sealed separately for each station on a daily basis, and submitted together with the daily report to the ticket office. If ten or more are found missing in the whole month, a demerit will be recorded. If waste tickets are fraudulently resold, in addition to ordering compensation and revoking the agency right, the case will be sent to the local government agency to recover the losses in accordance with the seriousness of the circumstances. 10. In addition to the seals and ticket punching copper seals, etc., that the agent station should use, it may receive them from the Company. All other stationery that should be used must be provided by itself, but it may be entrusted to the Company for the price to be processed, in order to be uniform. 12. The agent station's housing, as well as all miscellaneous expenses, advertising, and business expenses, shall be borne by itself, and the Company shall not be responsible for it. 13. At the end of each month, the Company will deduct 10% of the total amount of passenger tickets sold at the station as remuneration. However, when it exceeds 200 yuan, for every 100 yuan increase, the increased remuneration fee will be reduced by 1/10. For example, for 300 yuan, the increased remuneration fee of more than 100 yuan is 9 yuan, and for 400 yuan, the remuneration fee of more than 300 yuan is 8 yuan, and the total is 37 yuan (and so on). The agency station's remuneration fee will be issued by the Company on a regular basis after the monthly settlement and shall not be intercepted by itself from the ticket money. 14. The agent shall strictly abide by the Company's various rules and regulations and must obey all announcements of the Company and accept the inspection and guidance of the Company's station managers and inspectors. 15. The agent shall not engage in any acts such as overcharging for tickets, fraud, or embezzlement, or allow relatives, friends, or passengers to ride without a ticket. Otherwise, once it is found out, the loss suffered by the Company as a result shall be compensated, and the local judicial authority shall be requested to punish it in accordance with the seriousness of the circumstances. 16. If the agent does not wish to continue to act as an agent, it shall report to the Company one month in advance, and shall be allowed to resign after finding a successor. 17. If necessary, the Company may take it back at any time for self-management, and the agent shall not make any requests because of this. 18.

<h3 id="e94">Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce Requests the Opening of a Nanyang Shipping Route <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is currently planning to proceed.</p>
<p>The Da Gong She reports that the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce believes that Singapore is an important metropolis in Nanyang, with over ten thousand overseas Chinese residing there. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the shipping routes to the area have been interrupted, leading to difficulties in the transportation of domestic goods and severely impacting sales. In recent years, domestic products have been almost entirely displaced by foreign goods, which is deeply lamented. To promote domestic goods, the Chamber sent representatives back to China in November of last year to collect samples of domestic goods from various regions, which was well-received by the overseas Chinese community. The Chamber has scheduled a domestic goods exhibition to be held in Singapore on October 15th of this year and has sent letters to domestic goods organizations in various regions, encouraging manufacturers to participate enthusiastically. As the opening of the exhibition is fast approaching, the Chamber still faces difficulties in transportation. To ensure the success of domestic goods in overseas markets, it is necessary to first establish shipping routes to maintain long-term development. Therefore, the Chamber sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications in March of this year, requesting them to instruct the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to purchase additional ships and extend the company's Hong Kong route to Singapore to facilitate the promotion of domestic goods. However, as this has not yet been realized, the Chamber sent letters to various business organizations in this city yesterday, requesting unified support to urge the authorities to implement this plan as soon as possible. The Da Gong She reporter inquired with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday and learned that the company has already planned to open a shipping route to Nanyang. However, the leasing of wharves in various Nanyang ports and the purchase of additional ships have not yet been finalized, and due to economic considerations, it is difficult to open the route in the short term.</p>

<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation, under the orders of the Ministry of Communications to open a new Shaanxi-Chengdu route, dispatched a Junkers No. 6 aircraft, which took off from Longhua Airport in Shanghai the day before yesterday. It arrived in Xi'an at 4:31 PM that day. At 8:40 AM yesterday morning, the aircraft, with three people on board—acting head of the flight group He En'er, Xi'an station chief Yang Xingzhong, and German pilot Kast—took off from Xi'an station to test the new Shaanxi-Chengdu route. It arrived safely in Chengdu at 12:27 PM that afternoon, landing at the airport. The aircraft did not stop when passing through Nanzheng (i.e., Hanzhong). Although the direct route is 600 kilometers, the flight speed was particularly reduced due to the numerous mountains and ridges. The inspection of the mountains along the way yielded excellent results. It is expected that the flight will take approximately two hours when the route is officially opened. The aircraft is scheduled to fly from Chengdu to Xi'an on the 4th, and then return to Shanghai via Zhengzhou and Nanjing, following the Shanghai-Xinjiang route, before officially opening the route. After General Manager Li Jingcong arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning, he received a report that the test flight was successful and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Communications in Beijing. The opening date and ticket prices will be determined after the aircraft returns to Shanghai. It is expected that the route will be officially opened before the end of August.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Stock Exchange: A Humorous Official Letter <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Forwarding Tax Payment to the Public Works Department to Inquire Whether the Department Accepts</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, stating: "Sir, according to a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, 'Our tenant, the Guoxin Bank, claims that the Public Works Department arbitrarily overestimated the property value, considering that the rent of 800 yuan is definitely not the correct amount, which has caused complications in the collection of property tax. In fact, based on the current market conditions, a monthly rent of 800 yuan is already quite high. Now, the bank requests your association to uphold justice and provide assistance, and asks our exchange to provide proof, etc. After investigation, the bank's rent is indeed 800 yuan per month, with a contract, rent receipt, and account books as proof. Previously, because the building was vacant and no one was managing it, it had been empty for more than two years. Therefore, in March of this year, we rented it to the bank, reducing the rent to be better than leaving it empty for a long time. In this time of economic depression, we naturally cannot take costs into account. This is the situation of our exchange renting the property to the bank. If the Public Works Department, under the current circumstances, truly wishes to assume that the bank's annual rent is 17,000 yuan and deems it appropriate, then our exchange would be delighted to allow the Guoxin Bank to terminate the lease. Please have the department come to rent the property directly or find a tenant on our behalf, and we are willing to offer 5% as a commission. Our exchange's stock exchange building has many vacant rooms, and we would also like the department to quickly rent them or find tenants based on the valuation ratio of the Guoxin Bank, in order to increase the rent and avoid the pain of prolonged vacancy. This would greatly benefit property owners throughout Shanghai; otherwise, property owners will only suffer the blame of tenants, and tenants will also suffer the department's exploitation. We are specially writing to verify; we hope your esteemed association will investigate and handle it.' The above information was received by the association. After investigation, the agent lawyer of Guoxin Bank has already sent a letter to your esteemed department regarding this case. Now that there is proof from the landlord, your esteemed department should believe that the reported actual rent is reliable. If your esteemed department insists that the rent is definitely not just 800 yuan per month, then does your esteemed department have the ability to accept the exchange's opinion, according to the information in the letter? We are writing to request your investigation and joint handling." To Mr. Fei, Acting Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement.</p>

<p>The Hua Dong She reports that there was still no news yesterday regarding the Savoia aircraft presented by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flying to Shanghai. According to the Italian Consulate and the Meiji Yangxing Company, which is handling the aircraft, they had not received any telegrams regarding the departure for Shanghai as of yesterday afternoon, possibly due to the poor weather in Fujian and Guangdong. Furthermore, according to the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy, the visiting aircraft piloted by Japanese aviator Ano did not come to Shanghai yesterday either. Therefore, both the Italian and Japanese aircraft are currently still stranded in Hong Kong and will only be able to fly to Shanghai after the weather clears up in the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="e104">City Chamber of Commerce Cables Shaanxi Provincial Government, etc., Requesting Reduction of Special Tax on Domestic Enamelware <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce cabled the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the Office of the Financial Commissioner yesterday, stating: "(Titles omitted) On the 31st of this month, we received a letter from the Enamelware Trade Association, stating that the members of the association, such as the Zhonghua Enamel Factory, proposed that enamelware has long been popular throughout the country. In order to maintain the national foundation, the government has spared no effort in protecting and promoting the budding domestic industry. The taxes and levies imposed on it have always been in accordance with the Ministry's regulations on machine-made domestic goods, which exempt it from repeated taxation in any region within the country except for the export tariff. However, in recent years, various provinces have unilaterally promulgated tax laws due to financial difficulties. Some provinces define it as a local specialty, while others define it as a consumer good. The names are different, and the tax rates vary, but none is heavier than the tax rate set by the Shaanxi Special Tax Bureau. The tax rate in Shaanxi is determined by the Office of the Financial Commissioner and is purely a unilateral law of one province. For enamelware items such as rice bowls and lunch boxes, the tax is almost 10% of the value, which merchants cannot afford. Moreover, Shaanxi is located deep in the northwest provinces. Once this heavy tax is imposed, not only will sales in the province be greatly reduced, but it will also be difficult to purchase from Shaanxi to other provinces. If we do not list the difficulties and request the Shaanxi authorities to review and amend them, the future of domestic goods will be greatly affected, and foreign goods may take the opportunity to enter. The Shaanxi authorities have always been enthusiastic about domestic goods and will certainly understand the government's painstaking efforts to protect them, consider the difficult situation of business, and make fair revisions. Please have the chamber send a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce for review and approval, and humbly request that you submit a document to the Shaanxi Provincial Financial Commissioner, requesting that the tax rate on enamelware items under the 'magnetic' category in the tax rate be revised and reduced as soon as possible to facilitate sales and maintain domestic production," etc., which was received by the chamber. It is appropriate to report this to your esteemed chamber for review and forwarding, which is truly a matter of public concern. The association stated that, according to past practice, goods treated according to the machine-made western-style goods tax law could circulate throughout the country after paying taxes at the first customs office in the place of origin. Apart from the Chongwenmen tax, no other taxes were levied. This method has been followed since the middle of the Qing Guangxu era until the Republic of China, even when the Likin tax had not yet been abolished. The enamelware of the member factories of the association is manufactured by Chinese factories and enjoys the treatment of the machine-made western-style goods tax law. After paying all the regular and additional taxes at the Shanghai Customs, it should not be taxed again when sold in your province according to the above-mentioned precedents. The factory takes into consideration that the northwest provinces are financially strained and are currently focusing on water control and road construction, with everything needing to be rebuilt. Therefore, it cannot be treated as a normal case and cannot dare to request exemption from repeated taxation. However, it hopes that the enlightened authorities in Shaanxi province will reduce the tax rate. As the factory considers the situation and acts reasonably, it is not forcing the impossible. Your province will surely consider the fundamental purpose of cooperation between officials and the people and maintain the sales of domestic products. Therefore, we are writing to inform you of the situation and earnestly request your approval. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully asks."</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Red Swastika Society Begs for Disaster Relief for Victims of the Yangtze River Provinces <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Southeast Main Society's Relief Team Has Arrived in Wuhan; Zhijiang County in Hubei Province Reports a Catastrophic Submergence</p>
<p>The Joint General Office of the Southeast Societies of the Red Swastika Society is actively preparing for the relief of the flood disaster in the Yangtze River provinces. The Nanjing Southeast Main Society has organized a team to go west to the most severely affected disaster area in that province to provide emergency relief, and has also sent telegrams to various societies and sectors, begging for disaster relief for the victims. At the same time, the society also received a report from Zhijiang County in Hubei Province on the catastrophic submergence, which is recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Red Swastika Society's Circular Begging for Disaster Relief for the Victims stated: "Respectfully, Heaven has sent down a great disaster, and we have suffered a terrible flood. In the north, the Yellow River is overflowing, and the areas of Shandong, Henan, and Hebei have become half swamps. In the upper reaches, mountain torrents have erupted, and more than 100 counties in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have been flooded. According to telegrams received from various places, when the floodwaters suddenly arrived, the water level was as high as several or even more than ten zhang (a Chinese unit of length, approximately 3.3 meters or 10 feet). Dykes collapsed, and wherever the waves passed, cities and villages were turned into ruins in an instant. People were unable to escape and drowned in the raging waves. Counting the provinces together, there are millions of people. This is truly a disaster unseen in decades. Those who managed to escape are calling for help from rooftops, mountain peaks, or collapsed walls and withered trees. The situation is too tragic to bear. Even those who were fortunate enough to escape the floodwaters have had their houses, clothing, and food washed away, and they are exposed to the wind and rain, their lives hanging by a thread. These disaster victims are even more countless. Currently, the northern areas have been organized by the General Relief Society and the two Swastika Societies, in conjunction with various societies, to form a relief team and distribute relief in various directions. However, raising funds is difficult, and the work is very difficult. The relief team of this society has already set off for Hankou, carrying relief funds and medicines, and will transfer to the disaster area to carry out work. However, a cup of water compared to a cartload of firewood is shameful and cannot make up for the situation. The urgent task now is to combine the efforts of all and promote both righteous relief and official relief to save the people from their desperate situation and achieve stability. If we delay any longer, I fear that these millions of dying victims, the weak, will all starve to death, and the strong will take risks. What a tragic situation to imagine! At this time of successive years of famine and financial exhaustion, we know that fundraising is difficult. However, if we can all work together, accumulating grains can become a mountain. If we plan things with people in mind, we can surely turn the tide. All our compatriots, please have the compassion to treat others' hunger as your own and take universal actions to save everyone. The amount is not important, but at this time, every yuan can save a life. In this critical moment, please, gentlemen of virtue, act quickly! We bow to you for the sake of the millions of survivors. If you are willing to donate generously, please include the address and title of the letter with the donation and deliver it to No. 24 Xiaohuo Lane, Longwangmiao, or No. 4 Tongfu Lane, Juluda Road, Shanghai, or submit it to the collector. We will promptly issue a receipt, forward it to the disaster area, and publish it in the newspapers for acknowledgment to demonstrate our sincerity. Respectfully."</p>
<p>The Telegram from the Magistrate of Zhijiang County to the Red Swastika Society stated: "(Titles Omitted) The floods are overflowing, the land is submerged, and the disaster is catastrophic. Zhijiang County is the worst affected. On the 5th of this month, the water level of the Yangtze River suddenly exceeded the level of the past decade by two chi (Chinese foot, approximately 0.33 meters or 13 inches) or more. The Yangtze and Tuo Rivers overflowed, and the Ju and Zhang Rivers flowed wildly. In addition, with continuous wind and rain, mountain torrents erupted. Those near the river were spared, and those near the mountains could not protect themselves completely. The fields and crops were washed away, and the houses were turned into ruins. People and animals were swept away and became the spirits of the waves. Even those who were fortunate enough to survive are all hungry and exhausted, their faces pale and their bodies thin. They have not had a full meal for days. This time, the river suddenly rose, and the North Gate was breached. The residents were caught off guard and could only escape for their lives. Their properties were almost completely lost. The official embankment, which has been the first district's water conservancy project for hundreds of years without any changes, was also washed away by mountain floods, and the fields became wasteland. Yangxi is an important commercial town, but the backwater was too strong, and the houses were submerged to the roof, with nearly half of them collapsed. In Jiangbei (north of the river), the areas bordering the mountains and rivers, such as Changshoujing, Fuxingyuan, Sanheyuan, Yujiaxi Yuan, Wuliuyuan, Guojia Yuan, and the two towns of Jiangkou and Dongshi, are all threatened by the Yangtze River on the outside and washed by mountain floods on the inside. All of them have been breached. The Liumuyuan in the third district, the Xia Bailizhou, and the Gonghe Yuan are all on the Juyuzhang River basin. The mountain torrents flow from north to south, higher than the Yangtze River by more than a zhang. The force is even more fierce. Each Yuan has collapsed into a dyke, and the disaster is extremely severe. The houses and livestock have been damaged even more severely. The towns of Caopu and Fengtai have been completely destroyed. Shang Bailizhou, Yangjiaozhou, and Pianbaizhou, located between the Yangtze and Tuo Rivers, are attached to the outside of Shang Bailizhou, with a vast area. The Fufu Yuan, Fusheng Yuan, Tongfu, Tongde Yuan, and Xinli Yuan are surrounded by water on all sides and depend on the dyke for life. Fufu and Fusheng Yuan are low-lying, so they were the first to be breached. The dyke of Shang Bailizhou, which is closely connected to the two dykes, was also affected and suffered extremely severely. Attached to the outside of Yangjiaozhou are Zhonghe Yuan and Jicao Yuan. Zhonghe was breached, and Jicao followed. Jicao was breached, and Yangjiaozhou followed. Renhe Yuan, which is connected to Pianba, also suffered the disaster. Siyangzhou, Luzhou, Tongxinyuan, Zhongchengyuan, and Huazhouyuan are all south of the Nanhe River, located in the lower reaches of Songxi. Since the dike outside the North Gate of Songzi was breached, the water flow has been like a merchant building a bottle. None of the Yuan have survived. In short, most of the cities and towns in the county have been destroyed, and all the land for farming has been flattened. The disaster victims number about 100,000, and the losses amount to 50 million. Currently, the water level of the rivers is gradually receding, and it is possible to rush to plant autumn crops and autumn vegetables to try to make up for the losses. However, we are afraid that the river will flood again and that there is a lack of seeds. It is difficult to find a clean piece of land to escape to other places. If you step into the disaster area, you will see starving people on the road and hear crying that shakes the sky. It is truly unbearable to see or hear. I beg your esteemed society to show great compassion and provide prompt relief to save the people from the mud and water and relieve the suffering of the people. Let the dead be reborn and the scattered can reunite. The benevolence will be widespread and infinite. I respectfully report this to you and await your urgent instructions. Rao Guangya, Magistrate of Zhijiang County and Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, bows respectfully."</p>

<p>Da Da and Da Tong Companies Cooperate to Eliminate Bad Practices Like Extortion for Liquor Tips</p>
<p>The privately-owned Da Da Steamboat Company and Da Tong Navigation Company, which operate the Shanghai-Yangzhou route on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, have recently thoroughly reformed their ship operations for the convenience of merchants and travelers. As of yesterday, they abolished the compradore system on all ships and adopted a new management method. All the tea servers on board are now paid wages, eliminating the long-standing bad practice on Yangtze River ships of extorting tips for liquor and berth fees. Our reporter Lao Te from the New Sound News Agency visited Yang Guanbei, the manager of Da Da Company, who kindly explained in detail the cooperation between the two companies, the operational situation, and the actual progress of the improvements. These details are specially recorded below:</p>
<p>Cooperation Process</p>
<p>Mr. Yang first stated that our country's shipping industry has always lacked unity, and there are often internal conflicts among peers, resulting in losses for both sides. This is a major reason why Chinese merchant shipping cannot thrive. The Ministry of Transportation, recognizing this, promoted shipping cooperation in order to consolidate the foundation of the shipping industry. Da Da Company and Da Tong Company implemented cooperation in the 22nd year (of the Republic, i.e., 1933), establishing a joint office. They strive to reduce passenger and freight prices, with no intention of monopolizing. In recent years, rural bankruptcy and the nationwide economic downturn have led to a sharp decline in business compared to before. The two companies own a total of eight steamships, in addition to iron barges such as Chu Yuan and Chu Heng. In fact, supply already exceeds demand, and annual income and expenditure are barely enough to offset each other.</p>
<p>Actual Reform Situation</p>
<p>Director Peng of the Navigation Administration Bureau personally inspected and instructed on various points for improvement. Those that have been prepared include complying with the order to charge tea server liquor fees at a rate of 10% of the ticket price, and no overcharging is allowed, which has been implemented since August 1st. Awnings, handrails, and seats have been added separately. At the pier, police officers maintain order when ships arrive and depart. The pier management office also assigns 20 registered porters from each company to help passengers carry luggage and items, with fixed prices and no overcharging allowed. Since implementation, the order has been orderly, and there has been no crowding. Tea servers wear uniforms while serving, which is clean, tidy, and quite impressive. Each ship's cleaning duties are divided into sections and assigned to tea servers and sailors. In terms of life-saving equipment, there are multiple lifeboats, life jackets, and lifebuoys. Various medicines are also prepared to prevent emergencies. For fire prevention, there are pump machines and chemical fire extinguishers. Crew members and tea servers practice drills during their holidays to become proficient. There are also various books and magazines for passengers to read. After the ship sets sail, wireless radio is used to play elegant music and opera songs to entertain all the passengers' eyes and ears, relieving the boredom of the journey. Mr. Yang also said that Da Tong Company is now also complying with the order to make improvements, and the company's purpose is to serve the society, not just to make profits. Omissions and oversights are inevitable, and there will certainly be areas that are not perfect. We will study them carefully, and we also hope to receive guidance from advanced opinions to improve.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Recruitment Team Office of the China Aviation Association has started its first recruitment campaign, and has successively hired leaders from all sectors, organizations, institutions, and schools in the city to serve as recruitment team leaders, carrying out recruitment work separately with great effort. Now, Ye Zhendong, the Shanghai County Magistrate, and Wu Yaqin, the Principal of Huazhong Middle School, have been additionally appointed as recruitment team leaders, and various recruitment documents have been sent to them, asking them to work hard. The office has also received membership fees from Zhou Zaichang, the Deputy Team Leader of Team 406, who paid 138 yuan, from Zhu Wenqi, the Team Leader of Team 3, who paid 52 yuan, from Wu Dejun, the Deputy Team Leader of Team 406, who paid 33 yuan, from Li Mulian, the Team Leader of Team 141, who paid 70 yuan, from Tang Baoshu, the Team Leader of Team 33, who paid 100 yuan, and from Tao Baichuan, the Team Leader of Team 82, who paid 125 yuan.</p>
<p>The aviation swimming competition sponsored by Liangjiang was originally scheduled to be held on the 27th of last month. Due to the fact that Mr. Lu Lihua and Ling Xitao went to Qingdao to attend the National Sports Research Conference, it was changed to be held on the 10th of this month, as previously reported. It is said that the admission tickets are divided into two types: special tickets are one yuan each, and ordinary tickets are four jiao each. The ticket sales locations are at the YMCA and YWCA on Sichuan Road in Ba Xian Qiao, and the Da Ji Public Sports Ground. It is said that people from all walks of life have been rushing to buy tickets in recent days.</p>

<p>Limited to Members of the Bar Association</p>
<p>When lawyers go to visit inmates at the Ward Road Prison in Shanghai, the prison staff uses the membership list of the Bar Association as the standard. Only those who are on the membership list are allowed to visit. Recently, Lawyer Jia Yaoxi was entrusted by his client to visit an inmate at the prison the other day. Because Lawyer Jia had only joined the association last month and was not yet added to the membership list, he was refused by the prison. Lawyer Jia then presented his lawyer badge, but the prison staff refused to allow him to visit, resulting in a wasted trip. Afterwards, Lawyer Jia sent a letter to the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Bar Association, requesting that they quickly forward a letter of certification to the prison management staff before he could visit the inmates again.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Continued Report on Lottery Ticket Drawing Method <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The detailed method for drawing the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Tickets has been reported in this newspaper. According to our investigation, during the 25th joint meeting of the lottery ticket committee on the 31st of last month, Director Chen of the lottery ticket office made an important proposal regarding the drawing: "It has been found that the ticket number balls used for drawing are three thousand four-digit balls, from 0000 to 2999, and one hundred two-digit balls, from 00 to 99. Therefore, the numbers that can be drawn range from a minimum of 000000 to a maximum of 299999. In fact, 300000 cannot be drawn. However, the numbers of the issued lottery tickets range from 000001 to 300000. In order to maintain the integrity of the numbers, it is proposed to stipulate that ticket number ball number 000000 be used to replace 300000. If 000000 is drawn, it means number 300000 in the lottery tickets has won. Also, the newly revised prize level table lists bonus prizes, such as first and second prizes being the smallest or largest number, and the associated upper and lower numbers for bonus prizes. It is proposed to use a circular method to determine them. For example, if the first prize number drawn is 000000, i.e., 3(00000), then lottery ticket numbers 299999 and 000001 will be its upper and lower associated bonus prizes. If the first prize is number 000001, then its bonus prizes will be number 300000 and number 000002. Is this feasible? Please decide publicly." The committee, considering that this matter concerns the integrity of the ball ticket numbers and solves the problem of associated bonus prize numbers, passed the proposal and decided to implement it starting from the 13th drawing (August 9th).</p>

<p>In recent years, culture has been progressing rapidly, and imported fountain pens have been sold everywhere in the interior, resulting in significant losses. Previously, Dai Heqing carefully researched and invented a Yongxie brand ink spoon, which can be installed in ordinary pen tubes to store a large amount of ink, replacing the function of fountain pens. It is convenient to use, low in cost, and can recover profits. He specially entrusted Accountant Jiang Xinzhao to apply for a patent from the National Government's Ministry of Industry to promote it. It has been reviewed and commended by the Ministry of Industry and granted a five-year patent. Yesterday, he received patent certificate No. 37 from the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Reasons for Rising Flower Cloth Prices <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, the price of flower cloth has been rising recently. The reason is that a certain party has jointly formed a company to borrow money to purchase goods, trying to artificially raise flower prices in order to profit from it. However, the financial community, considering that the number of flower clothes pledged is already large, and new flowers will be on the market soon, the sales of old flowers will inevitably be sluggish. Therefore, they mostly adopt a policy of reducing loans for those who pledge old flowers. It is reported that a certain party has changed its policy and is contacting some smaller banks and money shops for mortgages, promising special benefits as a reward. It is said that an agreement is already in sight.</p>

<p>Wang Jinrong, a worker from Yufeng Yarn Factory, from Dongtai, had a minor disagreement with a certain Qu from Qin Prefecture in the same factory at about 4:00 PM on the 23rd of last month. Chen Guoxing, a ruffian friend of Qu, learned of this and took the opportunity to invite Ding Guizhang, Pu Xiaolin, and others to take Wang to a teahouse on Poyang Road, where they extorted three yuan from him. Chen lived in the Yufeng workshop and was expelled by the factory manager, and was not allowed to live there anymore. Chen suspected that Wang Jinrong had instigated this, so he waited on Poyang Road at 6:00 PM on the 26th. When Wang was returning home from the factory, Chen, Pu, and Chen used an axe to wound his head and body in three places, and beat him. He fell to the ground injured, and the perpetrators fled in a hurry. After the case was discovered, detectives Hou and Lin, and control officer Liu Changgen of the Yangshupu Police Station arrested Chen Guoxing and the other two one after another, and sent them to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Shanghai Municipal Council requested that they be severely punished. After deliberation, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the third criminal court yesterday morning and sentenced Ding Guizhang, Pu Xiaolin, and Chen Guoxing to eight months of imprisonment each. The number of days detained before the judgment is final will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Xu Peikun Discusses Recent Developments in the Financial Industry <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the financial situation in Shanghai has been chaotic. Our reporter specially interviewed economic expert Mr. Xu Peikun, questioning him about everything. His comments are revealed below:</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, rumors have flourished in Shanghai, and the financial market has been unusually chaotic. Margin calls and foreign exchange rates have soared and plummeted wildly. If this continues, not only will individuals be affected, but the national finances will inevitably fall into a desperate situation. Everyone knows that our country's economic structure is not sound. If we do not cultivate it to consolidate its foundation, the consequences are self-evident. Based on the situation in the past two weeks, the trend is extremely frightening. Everyone feels insecure and cannot rest easy. Those with assets are either rushing to buy spot goods for hoarding or buying up foreign exchange bills to seek safety. The more capital that escapes, the more the domestic financial system will be depleted, and the market will become increasingly chaotic and deteriorate. Agriculture, industry, and commerce will have no hope of recovery. The recent tension and panic are all due to rumors, especially regarding inflation. It is as if the government will implement inflation, making all money useless, and all industries hopeless. People are rushing to escape while they still have a breath left. It's like "one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark along." In an instant, it turns into a citywide panic.</p>
<p>However, we clearly know that the government will not implement an inflationary policy at this time. The recent rise in public prices is a very obvious indication. Moreover, the reserves of both Chinese and foreign banks have increased. For example, in 1929, it was 240,260,000 yuan; in 1930, it was 261,956,000 yuan; in 1931, it was 66,188,000 yuan; in 1932, it was 438,339,000 yuan; in 1933, it was 547,446,000 yuan; in 1934, it was 324,199,000 yuan; and in May 1935, it was 340,943,000 yuan. Except for the special circumstances of 1932 and 1933, the recent increase in reserves is very significant. If we only consider the reserves of Chinese banks, this year's reserves are higher than in any other year (except last year). That is, 290,165,000 yuan in May of this year, compared to the peak of 337,632,000 yuan in June of last year, the difference is very small. Moreover, this is due to the fact that all the silver in the interior is being imported into Shanghai. It can be seen that the outflow of silver is entirely silver from foreign banks. We cannot control its departure or retention. However, the amount of silver held by Chinese people is increasing endlessly. From this, it can be seen that the illness of today's market is not a lack of money but a lack of money circulation. It is like a person's illness is not anemia but polycythemia, making them prone to stroke.</p>
<p>In terms of the current market situation, the government has absolutely no need for inflation. If we consider the needs of large-scale economic construction across the country, there is a significant shortage of capital in all countries, which is indeed a symptom of anemia. However, inflation is definitely not the solution. Moreover, inflation is a very dangerous experiment, which I believe no wise financial authorities would be willing to undertake rashly. Perhaps the recent central government's plan to implement unified currency issuance has been mistaken for inflation, which is also possible. In fact, they are as different as heaven and earth. How can they be confused? The financial crisis that occurs every five years was fortunately quelled by the authorities' statement. Although the recent crisis was caused by unfounded rumors, the frightened birds urgently need a place to roost. Moreover, the matter is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood, as mentioned above. The financial authorities are expected to pay attention to it. If a timely statement is made to correct the errors of the rumors, then the stability of the people's hearts can be expected immediately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the subsidiary currency is complex and chaotic and must be reformed. However, if we only think that adopting the decimal system or using nickel to mint coins can solve the subsidiary currency problem, then we are missing the mark. Adopting the decimal system does have its conveniences, and it is extremely simple in terms of calculation. However, not adopting the decimal system or continuing to use the current subsidiary currency system is also not a hindrance. For example, the United Kingdom does not use the decimal system. Moreover, the lives of most people in our country are calculated in copper coins. Copper coins are to most people as silver dollars are to a few people. The reform of silver dollars can have a huge impact immediately, and the reform of copper coins will inevitably have an even greater impact. This subsidiary currency has been used for a long time, and the connection to people's livelihoods is extremely deep. In terms of the current state of people's livelihoods, there is no need for this reform.</p>
<p>Using nickel to mint subsidiary currency is even more ill-advised. In various countries in Europe and America, many of the smallest unit subsidiary currencies are minted with nickel. However, our country produces very little nickel. The smallest unit subsidiary currency is the copper coin and one-tenth of each copper coin. Using nickel would be even more uneconomical and would inevitably raise the standard of living suddenly, making it even more difficult for the common people to make a living. In short, there is no need to reform our country's smallest unit subsidiary currency, the copper coin, at present. Even for other subsidiary currencies, although there is no need for the decimal system, due to the issuance of silver dollar fractional notes, they are already trending towards the decimal system. The current subsidiary currency system has no fundamental flaws. The main reasons for the complexity and chaos are the lack of uniformity in the minting of subsidiary currency and the prevalence of private minting. If the central government can solve these two points satisfactorily, then the exchange rate between fractional silver dollars and the standard currency and the exchange rate between copper coins and the standard currency can be stabilized. Although there is no decimal system in name, there is the effect of the decimal system in reality. If the government wants to mint subsidiary currencies in units of fifty cents, twenty-five cents, or five cents, but lacks silver to mint them, then it may as well use antimony or tungsten to mint smaller unit coins, such as ten cents and five cents. This would not only promote domestic production but also increase chips, which seems to be slightly better than using nickel.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our country's subsidiary currency system is a currency system that is suitable for the living standards of the people. The areas that need reform are unifying the national subsidiary currency minting rights and cracking down on private minting. Other than that, it is not a matter of urgency. It is like dressing a weak body in fancy clothes, which is not beautiful and has no use. Recently, scholars have gradually begun to pay attention to production and sales issues, which is a good phenomenon. The root of our country's economic problems lies in the irrationality of production and sales and the irrationality of business management. The former can be seen in the issue of food. Although we claim to be a country based on agriculture, we have to rely on foreign rice and wheat. What else can we say? Mr. Peng Xuepei's advocacy of a policy of food self-sufficiency is indeed a life-saving policy. The latter can be seen in adherence to old customs. The management methods of our country's agriculture, industry, and commerce, except for a very small number of modernized enterprises, have not changed. However, the enterprises of other countries are changing with each passing day. How can we compete? The recent failures of financial businesses are also due to clinging to old habits. Minister Kong's explanation of the weaknesses of money shops is also nothing more than wanting to encourage the business community to work hard to move forward and achieve self-reliance.</p>
<p>In the above, it is said that our country's finances have not deteriorated and that there should be no difficulties in turnover since there are many reserves. However, what is frightening is that the impact of instability has created vigilance, and people are afraid to invest. At the same time, on the government side, the progress of construction projects, such as the construction of highways and waterways, and the establishment of various weighing factories, require a lot of money, which the reserves of Shanghai alone cannot cope with. This extra funding must be raised separately. In this turbulent time, people are panicking. It is appropriate to be open and honest and cooperate between the government and the public. For any new facilities, the government should carefully study them to establish trust and show impartiality. Mr. Kong has adopted the principles of stabilizing finance and stabilizing people's hearts. The current need is nothing more than seeking a strategy to stabilize the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e131">French Concession Police Continue to Arrest Rickshaws Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The total number has exceeded a thousand, and the situation is very serious. Rickshaw pullers petition party and government agencies for prompt negotiation.</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, rickshaw pullers in the French Concession do not support the Municipal Council's registration of rickshaw pullers. Therefore, the bureau began registration for a month, but no one applied. It was then stipulated that registration would be compulsory from August 1. Otherwise, vehicles would be detained, and they would only be returned after the rickshaw puller had registered. However, the rickshaw pullers still ignored the bureau's announcement. Therefore, 700 vehicles were detained on the 1st. Yesterday, the police continued to arrest them. Including the previous day, the number has exceeded a thousand, and they are being detained in various police stations.</p>
<p>Compulsory Registration</p>
<p>When the police arrest vehicles, most rickshaw pullers abandon their vehicles and flee. However, the police's initial intention was to force rickshaw pullers to register. Therefore, when arresting vehicles, they also arrested rickshaw pullers and took them to the registration office on Route Ghisi to register. In the past two days, only 14 rickshaw pullers were forced to register (there are more than 40,300 rickshaw pullers and 7,100 rickshaws in the French Concession).</p>
<p>Reduced Number of Vehicles</p>
<p>Since more than a thousand vehicles were detained by the police, the number of rickshaws in the French Concession has decreased. Usually, at the intersections of the two concessions, there are vehicles with "small permits" (i.e., French Concession permits) parked on the road. Now, because of the police arrests, rickshaw pullers dare not stop. As a result, fares have also doubled, causing hardship for pedestrians. The business of trams and buses has flourished as a result.</p>
<p>Report to the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers are unable to operate due to the detention of their vehicles, causing extreme panic in their livelihoods. They are all bringing their families and children to complain to the owners and the trade association. The rickshaw industry trade association specially sent representatives Qiu Chunshan, Yu Dajin, Zhou Jinyuan, and others to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to report the situation and ask for justice to be upheld and the actions of the French Concession to be corrected. The association's secretary, Yan Esheng, met with them and promised to send someone to investigate and handle the matter thoroughly.</p>
<p>Representatives Petition</p>
<p>Based on the resolution of the general meeting, representatives of the rickshaw pullers in the French Concession, including Xu Hongsheng, Zhou Li, Lü Yigao, Zhou Yongcai, Li Asi, and Yang Yougui, went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at 2:00 PM yesterday with a written petition. The bureau stated that the petition was not stamped and did not meet the formal requirements of official documents. Therefore, they were asked to complete the procedures and wait for review. They then went to the Municipal Government, but it was past office hours. Therefore, it was decided to go again at 9:00 AM today. At the same time, it was also decided to petition the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the French Concession, the Citizens' Federation, and various organizations for assistance.</p>
<p>Submit Documents to the Party and Government</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers submitted documents to various party and government agencies, stating: "Regarding the petition, the French Concession in this city is conducting a registration for public rickshaws. Since the announcement, the rickshaw pullers have been repeatedly advised by the trade association to proceed. However, the general coolie rickshaw pullers have been hesitant to move forward. This is because rickshaw pullers have many individual sufferings and sufferings associated with the rickshaw owners. We respectfully submit the details of the treatment in the concession: Rickshaw pulling is a profession where people work like animals, regardless of cold or heat, and rushing about without leisure. After paying the rickshaw owner's rent every day, the meager earnings are barely enough to fill their stomachs. If there are slightly more people in the family, they often have to endure hunger and starvation. It is even more common that business is slow and the earnings are not enough to pay the rent, resulting in days without food. Now, rickshaw pullers are required to register, and each person must pay a fee of fifty cents. This is rickshaw pullers' individual suffering number one. French Concession police need to fulfill a certain number of official duties every month. Therefore, rickshaw permits are often confiscated for no reason, and permits are lost or stolen. It is not possible to reissue them at any time, resulting in the suspension of vehicles. This is the rickshaw pullers' and rickshaw owners' joint suffering number two. According to human principles, even if they register, they should not be photographed or fingerprinted. Such behavior insults the rickshaw pullers' reputation and the rickshaw pullers' personality, reaching the extreme. This is rickshaw pullers' individual suffering number three. Moreover, rickshaw pullers take advantage of the busy farming season in the countryside to come and go at will. Or they have no fixed property or residence to rely on. They make a living by pulling rickshaws, coming and going freely, and there is no possibility of restriction. This is rickshaw pullers' individual suffering number four. In summary, the above points are illegal acts. Moreover, they are oppressing rickshaw pullers with harsh measures. Yesterday alone, hundreds of vehicles were detained. It is clearly seen that they are deliberately making things difficult for rickshaw pullers. At a time when the city is sluggish and various industries are struggling, the authorities should be providing relief. How can they allow the concession to recklessly exploit them? The public sentiment among rickshaw pullers is surging and unstoppable. Once a major disaster occurs, how can the overall situation be imagined? Therefore, we submit this petition, requesting your department (bureau) to show compassion for our suffering, and approve the transfer to the relevant authorities to carefully consider and allow the above points to be granted. Regarding the registration, or there may be room for maneuver. Otherwise, it is difficult to approve. We present this petition with extreme trepidation, awaiting your orders."</p>
<p>Rickshaw Business Statement</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Association issued a statement regarding the issue of responsibility: "The French Concession's current registration of public rickshaw pullers has caused all rickshaw pullers to express their opposition due to their own interests. In order to maintain their business, rickshaw owners sympathize with the rickshaw pullers. This association is the only legal group of rickshaw owners in this city, and it is our duty to safeguard the business of rickshaw owners. We have no hesitation in representing the public opinion of rickshaw owners, running around for negotiations, and appealing for assistance. Thanks to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for coming forward to mediate. On the rickshaw owner's side, for the sake of social security, we have always respected the opinions of the mediators and waited quietly for a solution. However, the French Concession authorities insisted on their established methods and refused to listen to others. As a result, all mediation efforts were ineffective. Moreover, the French Concession police stations took decisive measures from August 1, forcing rickshaw pullers to register and arresting vehicles along the way, detaining them in police stations. The number of arrested vehicles has reached several hundred. The losses suffered by rickshaw owners are extremely deep and significant. The number of rickshaw pullers forced to lose their jobs is nearly a thousand. Their livelihoods are cut off, and the public is in constant panic. In view of the ineffectiveness of mediation and the exhaustion of all negotiations, and the increasing number of vehicles forced to suspend operations and the unemployed rickshaw puller masses, if an unexpected dispute is triggered, the responsibility should be borne by those who caused this incident. In addition to protecting the business of rickshaw owners in accordance with the law, this association will not be involved in any actions taken by rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers. We are afraid that the public may not understand the truth, so we hereby declare this."</p>
<h3 id="e132">Pawnshops in This City Submitted a Petition to the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Reporting the history and current situation of the industry, which is affected by the market and has undergone great changes.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Trade Association previously received instructions from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation of the industry and report it to the bureau for relief purposes. After receiving the order, the association has now completed the investigation and mailed it to the bureau for review yesterday afternoon. The original petition and statement of the actual situation of the industry are as follows:</p>
<p>Document Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the submission of a report, in accordance with Order No. 6293 of the Municipal Bureau dated July 24, which stated: "In order to provide relief to businesses, this bureau previously formulated a Shanghai business situation investigation form. In April of this year, all industry associations were instructed to conduct a thorough investigation according to the form, discuss and report it, and submit it to the bureau within one month. The association has been overdue for a long time. Therefore, this order instructs the association to promptly comply with the previous order and submit a detailed investigation report within fifteen days of receiving this document, without further delay or blame. This order is hereby issued." After receiving this, we immediately complied with the previously issued form and truthfully filled it out below. We respectfully request your review and approval, which would be a great benefit. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Evolution and Current Status</p>
<p>1. Changes and Overview of Business Operations Over the Years: Pawnshops are a convenient industry for the people. The internal organization and business operations have rarely changed throughout history. In times of thriving markets and social stability, they rely on interest income to cover various expenses. In addition to dividends, even if there are profits, they are very limited.</p>
<p>2. Recent Business Situation and Reasons for Its Decline: Since the January 28 Incident, the market has been sluggish, and prices have plummeted. Most customers abandon their pawned goods without redeeming them, resulting in a sharp decline in interest income. Various expenses cannot be covered by revenue. The selling price of expired goods is only 60-70% of the pawned value. The loss of capital is truly significant. Therefore, those with weak financial resources have no choice but to close down. (1) Procurement and Manufacturing: The goods procured by pawnshops are all received through pawning. They do not engage in any manufacturing themselves. (2) Sales Situation: Expired pawned goods are usually returned to the pawnshop, which then purchases them at market value based on the expired pawn ticket. In times of thriving markets, the selling price can be 10-20% higher than the pawned value. Now, the market is declining, and buyers can inspect the goods item by item, which is called "looking at the goods." The value discussed by the buyer is only 60-70% of the pawned value. In order to sell the goods and seek profit, pawnshops have no choice but to sell them at a painful loss. (3) Comparison of Price Increases and Decreases Over the Years or Recently and the Main Reasons: Pawnshops accept daily necessities pawned by ordinary people. In times of stable prices, even after long-term storage for a year and a half, the capital can often be maintained when selling. However, nowadays, the styles of men's and women's clothing change rapidly, and prices continue to plummet. Many customers abandon their goods without redeeming them. When selling expired goods, they have to lose 30-40% compared to the pawned value. Compared with the past, the selling price is only half of what it used to be. For example, if the pawned value of a certain item is ten yuan, it can be sold for eleven or twelve yuan when it expires in a thriving market. Now, it can only be sold for six yuan. (4) Competition Between This Industry and Foreign Goods: Pawnshops are neither producers nor retailers, so there is no competition with other industries. (5) Difficulties in the Industry and Relief or Improvement Measures: The most difficult problem for pawnshops is that the operating income is not enough to cover expenses, the selling price of expired goods is repeatedly losing money, and the increased burden from employees' demands (although not fully implemented, the impact is very significant). At this time of market decline and financial drought, pawnshops feel the above difficulties very seriously. If this continues, they will all be forced to close down. If they want to provide relief, they must reduce rent, shorten the expiration date, lower the pawned value, and obtain low-interest funds for turnover to be effective. (6) Total Number of Employees and Treatment in This Industry: According to statistics from more than 30 pawnshops in the association, there are more than 500 employees in total. During the service period, in addition to salaries, there are also usage fees, which are distributed according to their duties. (7) Names of Newly Opened, Reorganized, and Closed Stores in Recent Years and the Reasons: In recent years, more than 20 pawnshops in the inland and concessions have closed down. The reason is that their businesses are declining and they are losing money. (8) Recent List of Store Names in This Industry That Have Joined and Have Not Joined the Association (Names and Addresses): Those who have joined the association are all stores opened in the inland. Their names and addresses have been reported to your bureau and are omitted here. Most of those who have not joined the association are stores in the concessions, so they cannot be reported.</p>

<p>Detained by the captain and sent to the police</p>
<p>The French warship S.de Brazza, which is stationed in China, regularly patrols the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It returns to Shanghai several times a year to enter the factory to inspect and repair the ship's engine. Yesterday, the ship sailed from the Yangtze River to Shanghai and immediately entered the Qiuxin Factory for repairs. As the ship was anchoring, a Chinese translator and servant took several boxes ashore. The captain discovered this and ordered the boxes to be opened. It was revealed that they were filled with opium and morphine. The two men were immediately detained by the captain and handed over to the police for questioning. According to reports, the two men were carrying a total of 160 kilograms of opium, 20 kilograms of raw opium, and 20 kilograms of unrefined morphine, with an estimated original value of around 70,000 yuan. If it were further refined, the market value would exceed 200,000 yuan. The French newspaper in Shanghai has also reported this incident.</p>

<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday, a self-owned car of the Bank of Communications, license plate number 10078, was transporting funds on Jinling Road, from Machen Road to Jinling Road. As it passed Debao Lane, opposite electric pole number 19, a bandit car was parked in advance. It was rented from the Feili Car Rental Company at 383 Xiaoshadu Road, which is under the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road Police Station. The city license number is 4313, and the rental license number is 17893. At the same time, opposite electric pole number 20, a small cart full of old long bamboo was parked. Seeing the Bank of Communications car approaching, the small cart deliberately blocked the road in the middle. At this time, the bandit car opposite electric pole number 19 rushed over and four people jumped out. Three of them were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, and one bandit was wearing a Xiangyun gauze short shirt and pants. Two bandits jumped onto the Bank of Communications car, each taking out a Mauser pistol to watch over the bodyguard Jin Baoqi and seizing Jin's pistol, number 3810. They then robbed the bank employees Leng Baozhen and Luo Shaonan of all the cash, totaling 1,391 yuan, and two receipt books, and fled. Police officer He Shuntian, number 2363, from the Hengfeng Road Police Station was on guard at the scene. However, during the robbery, two bandits first seized Officer He's pistol, number 132998, and watched over him, preventing him from taking action. After the bandit car left, He took the bank employees Leng Baozhen, Luo Shaonan, and the driver Qiu Yuhu to the police station to report the incident. At the time of the incident, the deputy leaders of the New Zhabei Branch Detective Team, Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan, the deputy squad leaders Dong Wenrui and Liu Changpei, and detectives Mao Gongzhao, Zhong Da, Fang Chaofu, Sun Youzhi, Zhou Deming, and others rushed to the scene. Chief Lu Pei of the Hengfeng Road Police Station also led police officers to pursue the bandits, but they had already disappeared. Later, the New Zhabei Detective Team dispatched officers, along with Chinese detective Xu Guirong of the Gordon Road Police Station, to investigate the Feili Car Rental Company on Xiaoshadu Road. According to the accountant Liu Xilong, four people came to rent the car at the time. He then sent driver Liu Defa to drive the car. According to Liu Defa, he was sent by the accountant Mr. Liu to drive the car to the bottom of the Zhaofeng Garden at Datong University. The area was deserted. The bandits then pushed him out and were watched over by two people in the soybean field. They were released a short time later. As of the reporter's deadline, the car from the Feili Car Rental Company had not been found. The small cart with old long bamboo used in the robbery on Jinling Road was also detained, but the cart driver was not the actual perpetrator. According to the Hengfeng Road Police Station, the bandits were carrying four Mauser pistols. However, according to the investigation of passersby, there were two Mauser pistols and two handguns.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Homicide Resulting from Argument Over Borrowed Hairdressing Scissors; Verdict Rendered <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Li Guangtai Sentenced to Two Years</p>
<p>Li Guangtai, a 17-year-old apprentice from Yangzhou working at the Gui Ji barbershop located at 198 Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, had an argument with Rong Zhengbang, a 24-year-old fellow barber from Yangzhou, on July 8. Rong borrowed a pair of hairdressing scissors from Li, and after using them, he returned them without sharpening them. After closing shop at around 12:00 AM that night, the two argued and quarreled over the unsharpened scissors. Rong then became violent and beat Li. In desperation, Li, unable to resist, took the scissors and stabbed Rong once in the left rib, penetrating his lung. Rong fell to the ground after being injured. Fellow shop workers sent Rong to the hospital for treatment. The hospital, as per usual protocol, reported the incident to the police station. Detectives arrested the suspect, Li Guangtai, and took him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Rong died on the 10th due to the severity of his injuries. The French police sent the body to the mortuary for examination. The Second Special District Court dispatched personnel to confirm the cause of death. The body was claimed by the family for burial. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution against Li for homicide. The details have been reported previously. The case has been investigated by Judge Sun Peng, and the date for the verdict was scheduled. Yesterday was the scheduled date for the verdict. Judge Li Changnian presided over the First Criminal Court on behalf of Judge Sun Peng. Li Guangtai was ordered to appear in court. After a brief interrogation of his age and background, the verdict was announced: Li Guangtai is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for causing death by injury. The number of days spent in detention prior to the judgment will be deducted from the prison sentence at a rate of one day of detention for one day of imprisonment. During the appeal period, the defendant will be transferred to the detention center to await instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e136">The Rampage of Wharf Bandits <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Fish Lost, Knife Wielded   A Lone Bandit</p>
<p>Yu, a fishmonger from Pudong named Yan A, is forty-four years old this year. His home is at the Jialukou (i.e., Longzhen) in Pudong. As usual, he would come to Shanghai at midnight to wholesale fish at the 16th Pier Fish Market, and then carry them back to Gongzhen to sell in the morning, which he did every day. The day before yesterday at midnight, Yan shouldered a carrying basket and came to Shanghai via the Bo Wharf, arriving at the fish market pier outside the 16th Pier of the French Concession (i.e., the Iced Fresh Wharf), waiting for the fishing boats to arrive and wholesale fish. Because it was still early, Yan sat on the pier to cool off and doze. In a short while, he was fast asleep. At one o'clock yesterday morning, suddenly three wharf bandits came together and, taking advantage of Yan's sleep, tried to reach into Yan's stomach pocket to steal silver coins. Yan woke up in shock in his dream, and saw that the three bandits were still trying to forcefully snatch it. Yan shouted, "Robbers!" One of the three bandits immediately took out a sharp knife and stabbed Yan's lips and left and right arms five or six times, causing blood to flow. The bandits then released their hold and fled. Yan still tried to stand up to pursue them, but fell to the ground in pain. One of the patrols, No. 156, and No. 542, a Chinese patrolman, heard the alarm and rushed over, capturing one bandit. He confessed his name was Zhou Chunsheng, eighteen years old, from Jiangbei, and lived at No. 13, Jinda Lane, Lan Ni Du, Pudong. He admitted that because the theft was unsuccessful, he committed the assault out of spite. His accomplices, Wang Atang and Li Jinbiao, had already escaped. The patrolman immediately took Zhou to the Xiaodongmen French Police Station for detention pending investigation. On one hand, the patrol head dispatched Detective Xu Guilin to send the injured person to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was quite serious. At ten o'clock yesterday morning, the police station escorted the bandit Zhou to the Criminal First Tribunal of the Second Special Court, where Judge Li Changnian conducted the trial. Attorney Yuan Jiahuang of the Police Department presented the case, stating that the police station had not yet completed the investigation and needed to apprehend the remaining accomplices. The victim was also still in the hospital receiving treatment and had not yet recovered. He requested that the hearing be postponed. The court verified the report, interrogated the defendant Zhou Chunsheng, and then ordered that the hearing be postponed for seven days. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Disputes Once Arose over Jewelry   Why Was the Injury Report Submitted After Death?</p>
<p>Zheng Yugui, the young owner of the Yongning Pawnshop at No. 20 Chengdu Road, is from Chaoyang, Guangdong. He is currently nineteen years old and still studying. When Zheng was four years old, he was betrothed by his parents to Chen Liana (one year older than Zheng Yugui), the daughter of Chen Xiushan, a Teochew merchant in Shanghai. By the winter before last, because both the man and woman had grown up, they held a wedding on October 21st of that year. On the morning of the 9th of last month, at around 11:00 AM, Chen Liana suddenly committed suicide by opium. The police were notified, and she was taken to the hospital by car.</p>
<p>Treatment was Ineffective</p>
<p>She died at 1:00 AM on the 10th. The prosecutor of the First Special District Court examined the body and confirmed that she had died by suicide. He ordered the body to be taken away for burial. After his wife's death, Zheng Yugui discovered that about 10,000 yuan worth of his wife's jewelry was missing. He reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station and requested an investigation. On the 17th of last month, Zheng found two notes left by Chen Liana in a drawer. One note said:</p>
<p>All jewelry</p>
<p>Is placed in the rattan basket in the third-floor bathroom of my mother's house. The other note said that after death, she must be dressed in He Xian's clothes. These clothes were also in the rattan basket. When Zheng saw these two notes, he noted that the clothes that the deceased wore when she was encoffined were all brought by his in-laws, and they matched what was written on the notes. Therefore, there was no doubt that the jewelry was in his in-laws' house. He then reported the situation</p>
<p>To the police station</p>
<p>The police station ordered Chinese detective Huang Fusen and Western detective Harvey to go to Zheng's in-laws' house at No. 84, Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, to investigate. According to Zheng's mother-in-law, Chen Yang, the bathroom had never been opened, and she did not know if the jewelry was there. She then claimed that the jewelry had been handed over to her son-in-law at the Wan Guo Funeral Home. At the time, Zheng thought that since they were relatives, it would be better to postpone the negotiation. However, the next day (the 18th), Chen Yang also reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, saying that her</p>
<p>Son-in-Law Zheng Yugui</p>
<p>Had repeatedly abused her daughter. Before March 12th last year, he had beaten his daughter Liana, causing injuries. She was treated at Renji Hospital, and there was an injury report. The injury report was handed over to the maid, Lu Wu, before she committed suicide and then transferred to me. She requested that a public prosecution be initiated. The police station granted the plaintiff's request and filed a public prosecution against Zheng, which was handled by the Special Court.</p>
<p>Issued a Summons</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Zheng Yugui was summoned to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Judge Ye Shengchao took the seat to conduct the trial. Zheng Yugui hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend him. First, lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station stated that the police station was now prosecuting the defendant in accordance with Article 277, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. After the police station received the plaintiff's report, it filed a lawsuit in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, stating that after the death of the victim, her relatives could file a complaint. At that time, the plaintiff</p>
<p>Submitted an Injury Report</p>
<p>One copy. The injury report stated that the deceased had five injuries. The injury report was then submitted to the court. The court summoned Chen Yang to the court and asked her in detail when she learned that her daughter had been beaten. The court then asked why the deceased did not tell her beforehand, but only handed over the injury report to the maid before committing suicide. She replied that her daughter had instructed the maid not to tell me after being beaten, so</p>
<p>I Didn't Know Before</p>
<p>And so on. Then Lu Wu was summoned to court for questioning. Defendant Zheng Yugui confessed, "My wife and I have always been harmonious. Her suicide this time was due to the fact that my family is an old-fashioned family, while her family is a new-fashioned family." Lawyer Chen Churu immediately presented three letters written by the deceased to prove the affection between the young couple. In one of the letters, she even instructed the defendant not to let the maid Lu Wu know about family matters, because the maid was good at stirring up trouble. He also made a statement about the jewelry incident. Lawyer Zhang of the police station stated that the police station had not accepted the jewelry incident because it was a matter of civil property rights.

<h3 id="e139">Gangsters, in the Name of the Blood Soul Extermination Squad, Extorted 50,000 Yuan from Sun Bosheng, Sun Yu, et al. Acted as Representatives of the Plaintiff to Negotiate Several Times, Ye Yongbiao Was Captured by Detectives While Counting Banknotes <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Sun Bosheng, a director of the Zhengda Bank on Tianjin Road, lives at No. 15, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road. Last month, he received several threatening letters from a criminal gang claiming to be representatives of the Xishou Command of the Blood Soul Extermination Squad, with the seal of the Blood Soul Extermination Squad, demanding 50,000 yuan. Sun reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which ordered Detective Wu Chengmo, Detective Ma Derong, Detective Ni Jiafeng, and others to conduct a secret investigation. Until the day before yesterday,</p>
<p>(The Suspect Was Arrested) Ye Yongbiao (i.e., Ye Chenglin), a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, was taken into custody by the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the First Court. The police station filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 346 of the Criminal Law for the crime of extortion. Lawyer Yu Xunjiu of the police station then began to describe the details of the case, stating that at 11:25 AM on the 23rd of last month, the victim, Sun Bosheng, brought a registered threatening letter to the police station. Detectives found that the letter contained fierce language and claimed to be representatives of the Blood Soul Extermination Squad stationed at the Xishou Command, attempting to extort 50,000 yuan, and arranged to meet at Hankou Road</p>
<p>(Yangtze Hotel) The police station ordered Detective Wu, together with Sun's representative Zhu Xian, to wait in rooms Zi Zi 4 and 716 in the Yangtze Hotel. At 5:00 PM on July 26th, room 716 suddenly received a phone call from the criminal gang. Detectives, disguised as Sun's representatives, negotiated with the gang. The gang demanded 50,000 yuan. After negotiation, they pretended to agree to pay 20,000 yuan and agreed to hand over the money there in an hour. Unexpectedly, the gang did not show up. The next day, the gang called again, and Detective Wu answered. According to their story, they were very sorry for not showing up yesterday. Now</p>
<p>(Coming to Collect the Money) Shortly after, a person came to room 716 of the Yangtze Hotel with a letter. Detectives found that the person was a tea server from the Donghu Hotel, surnamed Liu. The letter stated that the money should be placed in a paper box and handed over to the person who brought it. The detectives thought that Liu was a tea server and it was not appropriate to hand it over. They also sent a detective to follow Liu to the Donghu Hotel in order to track down the gang. However, the gang had already left the Donghu Hotel, so there were no results. Until 2:10 PM on July 30th, Sun received the third letter from the gang, in which Sun was blamed for not contacting them. The company is now opening a room at the Shenzhou Hotel</p>
<p>(Continue Negotiations) The team will send someone here. The detectives then joined Sun's representative to wait in rooms 404 and 421 of the Shenzhou Hotel. Until 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, room 404 suddenly received a phone call, asking if the money was ready. If it was ready, a representative surnamed Ye would be sent at 5:00 PM. Detective Wu answered the phone again. Each side said that the money was ready and asked them to come and collect it. At about 5:00 PM, the defendant arrived, hiding a black wooden light switch in his sleeve, exposing one end, pretending to be a pistol, and asked if Mr. Sun was there, saying that he was</p>
<p>(Blood Soul Extermination) The representative sent by the group. Detective Wu replied that he was not there and that he was the representative. How much money do you need at least? The defendant replied that the minimum was 10,000 yuan. Detective Wu said that he only had 1,000 yuan ready now. If he wanted to increase it, he had to call Mr. Sun. The defendant also expressed his willingness to accept 2,000 yuan. The detectives then wrapped several packages of white paper, with a real banknote on the surface, in newspaper and put them in a paper box and handed them to the defendant. The defendant insisted on opening the box to check and count the banknotes. When he was about to</p>
<p>(Open the Paper Package) Found that it was not banknotes. At that time, the detectives also realized that what the defendant was hiding in his sleeve was not a pistol, but a counterfeit. So, with a secret signal, the lurking detectives stood up together and arrested the defendant, taking him to the police station. The case is now requested to be postponed in order to arrest the accomplices. Then, Sun Bosheng, along with the witness Xian, filed a complaint about what happened, and Detective Wu Zhai Ming explained the situation of solving the case. The defendant Ye Yongbiao confessed that this matter was planned by Shen Dehua, Yao Gongda, He Fengxian (i.e., Xiao Lu), Ying Maoxian, and me.</p>
<p>(Five People Conspired) Discussed at Xiao Lu's house at No. 95 Guangxi Road. Because Yao knew Sun, Yao proposed writing a letter to Sun to threaten him. After the money was obtained, Yao would get 30%, and the remaining 70% would be divided equally among the four of us. Yao also figured out how to make the seal. The first letter was drafted by Yao, and Xiao Lu went to the post office on Fujian Road to register and send it. On July 26th, Shen and Ying went to the Yangtze to inquire about the news and learned that Sun had sent someone to open room 716 in the name of Rong Sanbao. Then again</p>
<p>(Wrote Two Letters) On July 31st, Yao and Ying went to Shenzhou to see what was going on. So, they opened a room in the Zhaoshang Hotel across from Shenzhou to hold a meeting. On the one hand, the fourth letter was handed over to me to bring to Shenzhou to be arrested, and so on. Finally, Sun Bosheng said, "I don't know Yao Gongda and others. Only He Xiaolu, eight years ago, was a tea server on the Taidong steamboat that I heard about. So, I know him. But I haven't seen him for three years. I now ask you to arrest He and bring him to justice." Judge Liu Yugui ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and postponed the trial for seven days.</p>

<p>A Woman Returned Home and Suddenly Saw Another Woman in Bed, Accusing Her Husband of Adultery According to the New Criminal Law</p>
<p>Xu Wenqing, a native of Wenzhou, is 38 years old and runs an umbrella shop on Fuyou Road, Xinbeimen, in this city. He married Ms. Hu (35 years old) in the past. The couple was harmonious and lived together in the shop. This time, Ms. Hu returned to her hometown of Wenzhou for something, and went home to visit her relatives. On the night of July 23rd, she took a boat from Wenzhou back to Shanghai. When she arrived at her home on Fuyou Road, it was already around 10:00 PM. She immediately went to the bedroom and saw a woman, Pan Wu, lying in bed with her husband. Ms. Xu Hu couldn't help but feel jealous and called the police to arrest Pan Wu and her husband Xu Wenqing together into the Yimiao Police Station. According to Pan Wu, she was 40 years old and came to Xu Wenqing's house to collect old debts, and there was no irregular behavior. When asked Xu Wenqing, he also denied everything. However, the plaintiff Xu gave to Public Security Bureau the couple photograph of her husband Xu Wenqing and Pan Wu with a discussion. The Public Security Bureau submitted the case to the Local Court for investigation the day before yesterday. After the investigation was conducted by Prosecutor Du Jiasheng, he ordered Xu Wenqing and Pan Wu to be detained separately pending investigation. On the one hand, Xu Hu hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to write a complaint to the court, requesting that he be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year in accordance with Article 239 of the New Criminal Law for having a spouse and committing adultery with others, and the adulterer shall be punished in the same way. (It has been implemented since July 1st) According to Article 256 of the former Old Criminal Law, a married woman who commits adultery with others shall be sentenced to imprisonment for two years, and the adulterer shall be punished in the same way. This time, Ms. Xu Hu accused her husband of adultery, which is the first interesting case of its kind in the Local Court.</p>

<p>Hu Claimed that He Was Mentally Confused at the Time and Is Now Willing to Die to Repay His Wife's Life</p>
<p>Hu Shen, a woman from Shaoxing, 36 years old, recently rented a room alone at the home of Wang He, an old woman from the same hometown, at No. 464 Donghanbili Road. She worked at the Huaxing Tobacco Factory to support herself. Her husband, Hu Youxing, used to run a fresh meat shop, but has been unemployed for more than a year. Because he could not support his wife, they parted ways, and he stayed in Pudong. He thought that he had come to Shanghai from his hometown at noon on the 23rd of last month, and quarreled with Shen. She scolded him severely. Hu Youxing became angry and took a kitchen knife from the side and severely injured her head, causing blood to flow like a fountain. She fell to the ground and called for help. Chinese detective Zhang Youming and patrolman No. 1302 heard the alarm and came to arrest Hu. Together with the murder weapon, they were taken to the Huishan Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court. Because she was seriously injured in the hospital, she could not go to court to testify and was ordered to be remanded in custody, pending her recovery. However, Hu Shen died at 1:00 PM the next day. The body was sent to the Feilun Road Inspection Office, where the prosecutor appointed by the court examined the body and filed a case. Yesterday morning, Jiang Shuzi approved the case and presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Tribunal. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department described what happened and said that Hu Shen was silent from the time she entered the hospital until her death. They did not know the truth of the serious matter that led to this tragedy. The deceased was usually very well-behaved, as confirmed by Ding Ren, a woman from the same factory. She said that she had worked with the deceased Hu Shen in the factory for a long time and had a very good character. My family lives at No. 101 Youheng Road. In the morning, she came to my place and asked me to eat watermelon. She didn't eat it and hurried back. Later, I learned that she was stabbed by her husband, but I didn't know the details. When asked, the defendant confessed that he married her when she was only 17 years old, but she was infertile. At that time, I went to ask her to wash my clothes, but she scolded me. In a moment of anger, I took a knife and stabbed her. The court declared that your wife's head was found to have knife wounds, and there were also bruises on her face and chest, which were purplish-blue, and blood was flowing from her eyes. Why did you do such a cruel thing? You might as well tell the truth. He replied that there was nothing else, and that he was mentally confused at the time and could not control himself. I am now willing to die to repay my wife's life, and so on. The judge appointed a lawyer to provide him with pro bono defense. He still was ordered to be remanded in custody, and a date was set for sentencing.</p>

<p>— (Bai Ding)</p>
<p>Although it is said that "every profession produces its own expert," people are actually "complaining about every profession they are in." This is truly an inexplicable philosophy.</p>
<p>People in society admire the happiness of school life, but when they recall their student days, how much they wanted to enter society! However, in the end, society disappoints them.</p>
<p>Goethe said, "No girl is bad at being sentimental, and no boy is bad at falling in love." The concept of love between men and women is that men are dewdrops, while women are just hidden.</p>
<p>"Okay, you wait and see, I'll show you what's what later." It is said that this is the last trump card of our Ah San. However, what is "what's what"? That remains unknown.</p>
<p>A friend who was complaining about the literacy campaign said, "Damn it, literacy? Does literacy mean we won't even have food to eat?" Alas! This is the good nature of the citizens of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Stupid people are called "honest"; bad people are called "smart."</p>

<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>I accidentally passed by ×× Lane and suddenly heard a chaotic sound of reading, which aroused my curiosity. Without hesitation, I stepped into the gate of No. × and temporarily acted as an uninvited guest.</p>
<p>It was a small room with extremely poor lighting. Inside, there were four or five dirty square tables, each filled with children who had sallow complexions and were malnourished. Some were hunched over writing, some were reading in a beggar-like street cry, some were secretly teasing each other, and some were fast asleep...</p>
<p>Against the window was a long, old-fashioned account table, and a large armchair that could seat two people. Sitting on the chair was an old tutor wearing a melon-skin gauze hat and old-fashioned glasses, shaking his head and using a vermilion brush to correct the students' test papers, humming "zhī hū zhě yě" like a mosquito!</p>
<p>Suddenly, he slammed the ruler hard and shouted loudly, "Fusheng, come here!" Immediately, a student aged eleven or twelve, with a trembling and fearful expression, ran to his desk. The old tutor immediately twitched his beard and launched into a long series of praises. At the same time, the mahogany ruler repeatedly struck the palm of the student's hand!</p>
<p>Only then did he catch sight of me, the uninvited guest standing at the door. He stood up to greet me, cleared his throat with a "hmm-ha" sound, and spat out a mouthful of thick phlegm; it seemed like he was clearing his throat first, and then preparing to talk to me!</p>
<p>He told me that he was a top-ranked juren in the Qing Dynasty and had been teaching for over twenty years. In the past, the students' tuition fees were enough to support his family, but in recent years, schools have sprung up, snatching their livelihood, and the authorities also want to strictly ban them. He sighed greatly, and his sobs did not stop!</p>
<p>His stubborn, impoverished, and bitter expression not only failed to arouse my sympathy but instead made me feel completely disgusted. I have always maintained that in the current era of vigorous reading and literacy, such private schools, which are internally corrupt and harm other people's children, must be banned and eliminated!</p>
<h3 id="e150">Starting from Proverbs <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— A Certain Person</p>
<p>Now, writers often pride themselves on being erudite, and the so-called classics they quote in their articles were mostly proverbs at the time. Moreover, more than half of the three hundred poems selected and preserved by Confucius are clearly folk songs. These kinds of ancient sayings and ancient poems, regardless of which aspect they describe and praise, feel particularly beautiful and make people reluctant to let go, even today. The value of so-called ancient sayings and ancient poems lies in this.</p>
<p>This is because these proverbs mostly come from nature and contain no artificial embellishments. However, when they are passed down orally, they disappear in a flash, making it difficult to feel much interest. Once they are included in the writings of writers, they become like bright pearls and beautiful jade, impressive and remarkable, and become excellent materials for writing.</p>
<p>Each region has its own unique proverbs, and the creation of these proverbs is based on life and society. Therefore, one can see the form of life and social phenomena in proverbs. For example, the groans of the sick, the cheers of those enjoying themselves, the laments of the frustrated, the sorrows of the wounded, and the anger of the enraged are all unavoidable. Shanghai's social life is relatively complicated, and at present, it is even more full of various abnormal states. Therefore, Shanghai's proverbs are chaotic and complicated, unlike the simple and superficial ones in other places. So, if you want to study the actual situation of Shanghai's social life, starting from these proverbs is the best way. At the same time, these proverbs are also of relatively greater value in literature.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhongxian's recent book, "Illustrated Shanghai Proverbs," has now been published. Mr. Wang has not only lived in Shanghai for a long time but has also deeply entered various societies. In particular, Mr. Wang is also a playwright, so he has a deep understanding of Shanghai. Therefore, he is especially good at writing this book. In addition to including all the Shanghai proverbs, the book also states their origins in a clear and concise style and connects them to stories. After reading it, one feels that Shanghai's viscera are all in this book. At the same time, to increase interest, Mr. Xu Xiaoxia has also drawn pictures for each chapter to show its form and sound. Therefore, the book is beautiful and difficult to match. In terms of its contribution in various fields, its value is even immeasurable. (The entire book is forty hundred thousand words and costs one yuan and two jiao. It is published by the Social Daily Newspaper Office on Ningbo Road, Guangxi Road.)</p>

<h3 id="e152">The Imperial Fragrance Drifting Record <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Qingdeling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 30: Facing the Sun with Lotus Flowers in the Morning</p>
<p>On the day the Empress Dowager decided how to punish the corrupt Guangdong Governor, although she had disregarded sentimentality, abandoned benevolence, and resolutely announced her views, these views were only driven by a temporary sense of justice and did not come from her original intention. Afterwards, she thought of the merits of the punished person's ancestors and father in this dynasty, as well as several achievements he had shown in the past, which made her feel infinitely uneasy. The smile on her face completely disappeared, and her face was always iron-blue, as if she were holding a belly full of sorrow and anger. Seeing this, I couldn't help but feel strange. Although I also knew it was because of the rebellious minister, at that time, I didn't know the nature of this punishment was so serious and the impact was so lasting. So, I was very strange as to why she was so uneasy after the punishment.</p>
<p>Because of the Empress Dowager's unhappiness, the entire inner palace was once again plunged into a gray atmosphere as usual; all the eunuchs, palace maids, and even female officials were worried, fearing that they would be caught and used as tools for venting her anger. Everyone didn't even dare to walk casually, tiptoeing and trying their best not to make any noise. They reduced their speech especially, and even if they had something to say, they only used whispers. In fact, the Empress Dowager didn't have any anger, she just felt very sad in her heart, as if something was stuck in her throat. Seeing her open her lips repeatedly, wanting to say something to me, but repeatedly held back, it can be seen that she was really thinking very painfully in her heart. (380)</p>
<p>Character Sketches</p>
<h3 id="e153">Anecdotes of Pan Xiao Jiu <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Ding</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Xiaojiu of Wumen had long been an official and, tired of his travels, returned to Shanghai, where he enjoyed a reputation for chivalry. He was most skilled in the art of character divination, unlike Xie Shi of the Southern Song Dynasty, and was considered a top-tier master of the art. He had no pre-written scrolls, and would interpret characters chosen at random, offering explanations that were extremely logical and reasonable. Therefore, friends and relatives often sought his guidance on difficult matters, and his instructions invariably proved miraculously effective. As a result, he was known as the second Xie Shi.</p>
<p>Pan and Zhang Zongchang were very close in their early years and had a deep friendship. After Zhang became the military governor of Shandong, Pan did not go to him despite several invitations, because of Zhang's poor reputation in governance. Later, when Zhang came to Shanghai and met Pan, he dragged him to Jinan. Pan had no desire to become an official, so in Jinan, he indulged in pleasure with Cheng Guorui, Qiu Fengzhen, and others, and did not often meet with Zhang. At this time, Li Jinglin had just retreated from Zhili to Jinan. Tianjin had been taken by Feng Yuxiang, and Li wanted to use Zhang's military power to recover Tianjin, but because Feng's power was at its peak, he had not yet launched an attack. One night, Li had a dream in which he saw three large spirit tablets, with the words "Kui Wu" on the top of the central one, "Fan Chong" on the right, and "Fan Yu" on the left. After waking up, the vision was vivid in his mind, and he was greatly surprised. He told Zhang about it, but Zhang was a crude man and knew nothing about character interpretation. At this time, Qiu Fengzhen was serving as the president of the Shandong High Court and was by Zhang's side. He thought of Pan's character divination and told Zhang and Li about it. Zhang and Li had also heard of Pan's miraculous accuracy in character divination, so they immediately ordered Qiu to invite Pan to the governor's office to study the dream. The next day, when Pan arrived at Qiu's invitation, Li immediately asked Pan to interpret the six characters from his dream. After looking at them, Pan, noting that it was currently mid-December, gave a very insightful explanation. He said that the first character "樊" (Fan) contained two "木" (wood) characters and a "爻爻" (gua) character in the middle. The two "木" characters combined formed the character "林" (Lin), as in Li Jinglin. It was winter, and the trees were withering. Meeting the "六爻爻" (six-gua) meant that there would be war. Splitting the "林" (Lin) meant that Li Jinglin had lost Tianjin, but the "樊" (Fan) character was on the left, so it would have to come from the right. Winter would pass and spring would arrive. In spring, the trees would flourish. Under both "樊" (Fan) characters were "大" (big) characters, forming "兩大" (two big), meaning that they could each gain a big advantage with Zhang, recover Tianjin, and once again accomplish a great feat. Furthermore, the character "崇" (Chong) meant "宗" (ancestor) under a "山" (mountain), representing relying on Zhang Zongchang like Mount Tai. The character "鈺" (Yu) meant gold and jade, representing the brotherhood of Wu Ziyu. By relying on these two, they could regain the lost territory. The character "魁" (Kui) came from "鬼" (ghost) plus "酉" (you), meaning ugly enemies who were not worth worrying about. "斗" (dou) plus "門" (men) rightly indicated a time of battle. The character "武" (Wu) meant stopping the spear, but this was a time for using force, so how could they stop the spear? Moreover, the spear in this case was not a correctly written spear, but a reversed spear, so they had to guard against someone turning against them. After the interpretation, Li was amazed by the mention of Wu Ziyu, who was indeed a sworn brother. Zhang wanted to know whom Pan was referring to with the talk of turning against them. Pan initially did not say, but as he was leaving, he secretly told Qiu that the person who would turn against them was Fang Zhenwu. This was hinted at to Zhang, as the character for defending against treachery, "防" (fang) contained the character "方" (fang), and the phrase "正當用武" (at the time of using force) contained the characters "正武" (Zhenwu). Sure enough, within three days, Fang Zhenwu turned against them. The following spring, Li Jinglin, with the help of Zhang and Wu Ziyu, regained Tianjin. Pan's character divination had been completely validated.</p>
<p>On another occasion, a friend asked Pan to divine the character "腦" (brain). Pan immediately warned him to be careful, because the character "腦" (brain) had the "災" (disaster) character at the top and the "凶" (ominous) character at the bottom. Although the disaster had not yet occurred, there would be an ominous event. The friend then asked who would be in danger and what the ominous event would be. Pan said that the character "腦" (brain) could be written as "脳", containing the character "凶" (ominous), meaning that someone would die. The part of the character next to the "肉" (meat) looked like "月" (moon), resembling flesh and blood but not quite flesh and blood, meaning a daughter-in-law. He should quickly be on guard. The friend asked when the death would occur. Pan added the "月" (moon) character to the character "期" (qi), which contained "月" (moon), indicating this month. Moreover, the parts of the character, properly arranged, formed the numbers "二十六" (twenty-six) and "八" (eight) and "三" (three) - meaning the 26th at 8 PM. Later, the friend's daughter-in-law died on the 26th of that month at 8 PM. This kind of miraculous accuracy was no different from Xie Shi's. Furthermore, when Li Jicai attacked Jinan at Baliwa, Zhang Zongchang asked Pan to divine the character "一" (one). Pan determined that there was no cause for concern, because that year was the year of the Ox (丑), and adding "一" (one) under "牛" (ox) formed the character "生" (life). However, in the year of the Rabbit (卯), adding "一" (one) under "卯" (rabbit) would form the character "死" (death). Later, Li Jicai was indeed defeated and retreated, and Zhang died in the year of the Rabbit.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan, at the request of friends, has now decided to set up his divination table in Shanghai starting on August 1st. From now on, if we have any difficult matters, we can ask Pan for guidance, so as not to go astray.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Do Not Ask About a Daughter's Gender and Difficulties, Everyone Competes to See a Noble Person's Face and Admire Their Lofty Character</p>
<p>Zhiqian said: It seems that Mr. Zhang has already agreed to help you, right? Huanhua held the empty cup, staring blankly, her brow slightly furrowed, as if she was in great distress. Zhiqian said: It's not surprising. People who are guests elsewhere just want to earn some money to take home and enjoy, why would they help others? Huanhua said in a very low voice: That's for sure. It's just... it's just... he shouldn't have lied to me. She struggled to utter the word "I," and immediately two streams of tears rolled down her face. She didn't have time to use a handkerchief to wipe her tears, and just wiped her eyes with her fingers. When Zhiqian saw her crying and heard her say she had been deceived, he didn't need to ask what happened next. So he said: I think this Mr. Zhang is very busy today, maybe he doesn't have time to help you. Huanhua said: Mr. Cheng, didn't you hear? He just said that he could only help me tomorrow. He knows I'm eager to return home, so he said that on purpose. Even if I really waited until tomorrow, he might not be able to help me. Zhiqian said: Do you think that's him deceiving you? Huanhua said again with tears: Mr. Cheng is a smart person, do I need to explain it in detail? What else does a drifting woman have that people can deceive? It's just that... the night before last, he was drunk and very happy. He promised me ten dollars for expenses on the train. He also said that he had a relative who was an official in Nanjing and would introduce me to him. He could send me a train ticket to Shanghai and even send me some money. Naturally, I believed him. Yesterday, everyone was together again, busy with Miss Zhu's affairs. I sat in his room until after one o'clock in the morning. He said that guests were coming this morning and told me to go back, so I had to go back. (280)</p>

<p>Shen Siliang Advocates for Annual Discussion Conference</p>
<p>Qingdao, 2nd – The National Sports Discussion Conference concluded successfully at noon on the 10th. At 8:00 AM, Chu Minyi spoke on the value of national martial arts in sports. At 9:00 AM, Yuan Dunli gave a report on the submitted papers and discussion summaries on behalf of the organizing committee. Subsequently, the inaugural meeting of the Chinese Martial Arts Group was held, and it was decided to rename it the China Sports Association. Yuan Dunli, Wu Yunrui, Shen Siliang, Hao Gengsheng, and Cheng Dengke were appointed to be responsible for the preparations, and they would still maintain relations with the National Sports Association. Finally, Shen delivered the closing remarks, hoping that the discussion conference would be held annually so that the national sports community could exchange ideas. Zhang Boling and Zhang Jiwu left together for Jinan on the morning of the 2nd, en route to Tianjin. Zhang discussed the issue of the 19th North China Games. A chance to discuss further would be sought during the National Games on the Double Tenth Festival. If it remains inconvenient for the North China provinces to hold it next year, Qingdao City will be asked to host it again. However, the budget will be set by the Sports Association to avoid waste.</p>

<p>China's Preliminary Results</p>
<p>Official Representatives to be Announced After Review by the Committee; Over 700 Participants Forced Entry</p>
<p>The International Swimming Competition is scheduled to be held on the 14th and 17th of this month at the West Qing Swimming Pool. To prepare for participation, the Chinese team held preliminary trials last night at 8:00 PM at the Sichuan Road YMCA Swimming Pool. To observe true talent, the selection was not solely based on rankings but also on the quality of the results. Most of the registered participants were members of the Central YMCA and Guangdong teams, with only three individual participants. Therefore, last night's competition was essentially a contest between the Central YMCA and Guangdong teams, indirectly showing which team was superior. Last night's event was open to the public and free of charge, so by 7:00 PM, men and women were arriving in droves, leaving almost no space by the pool. Later, another three to four hundred people arrived but could not enter, so they rushed the door, causing considerable damage to the YMCA's glass door. The Boy Scouts maintaining order were also unable to do anything. Many of the participants were also pushed outside the door, delaying the start of the competition by 25 minutes. As more people arrived later, they were on the verge of breaking down the door, so it was decided to let everyone in. As a result, the poolside was so crowded that it was impossible to move. The event finally ended at 9:35 PM. The results of each event will be reviewed by the committee before the official representatives are determined. The Sports Association will register the team under the name of China, and the announcement will be made in about three or four days. The full results are listed below:</p>

Furthermore, it is expected that after Xu and others arrive in Shanghai, they will put on a performance match to allow the Chinese people to see how their skills have improved. However, according to an informal discussion with someone from the Sports Association, it is feared that they will not perform, and Mr. Xu will return to Java shortly after arriving in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Japanese Rikkyo University table tennis team, on an expedition to Shanghai, won four out of five matches. The Postal Workers suffered a crushing defeat to Rikkyo with a score of 5-2 the night before last, which was due to a misguided and failed strategy in forming the team.

<h3 id="e164">Ministry of Education Strictly Orders Colleges Not to Accept Students from Unregistered Private Schools <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>According to a key official in the Ministry of Education, students and graduates of unregistered private schools should not receive the same treatment as students from registered schools. This is clearly stipulated in the regulations for private schools. Unregistered schools have no legal basis, and students who rashly enroll in them will not be able to obtain graduation qualifications approved by the Ministry of Education upon completion of their studies. Rights conferred by law, such as subsidies for students and eligibility for various examinations for graduates, cannot be enjoyed equally with students from legal schools. This matter is related to the students' own interests, and the choice of school should be carefully considered. The Ministry of Education has issued earnest announcements to students, hoping that they will all understand this. Recently, the Ministry of Education again issued a notice to public and registered private colleges, stating that from the 24th academic year, they must absolutely not accept transfer students from unregistered colleges or students from unregistered high schools. From now on, students should pay even more attention when applying to schools. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>It has been found that public and registered private colleges should not communicate back and forth, wasting procedures and being improper. We hereby reiterate the previous order: from the 24th academic year, schools must absolutely not accept transfer students from unregistered colleges or students from unregistered high schools. If any have already been admitted, they should be removed immediately and should not be mixed in and reported to the Ministry. Rejection is of utmost importance. In addition to sending to the branches, it is ordered to comply. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Improvements to University Systems in Shanxi and Anhui Provinces <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Shanxi University: The Ministry of Education issued an order to Shanxi Provincial Shanxi University on the 2nd, stating, "The Ministry has dispatched personnel to inspect the school and has received a report. After detailed review, there are many aspects that need to be improved. The main points are outlined as follows: 1. The School of Education was formed by merging the former Shanxi Provincial School of Education. The Ministry previously ordered the integration of all departments of the school into the School of Liberal Arts. The name 'School of Education' should be immediately abolished. Existing Chinese Literature students should enroll in the School of Liberal Arts. The Department of Education should temporarily suspend enrollment. The Department of Electrical Engineering in the School of Engineering lacks equipment and duplicates the electrical engineering program at the Provincial Vocational School of Engineering. It should be discontinued starting next year. The mining and metallurgy departments should be merged into a mining and metallurgy department, with specialization in the third year. 2. Many departments in the school have established positions such as deputy director, and some departments have also established deputy directors, which is inconsistent with university organizational regulations. These positions should be immediately abolished. The number of staff members is excessive and should be reduced to save expenses. Of the 90 faculty members, 58 are part-time. Their expertise does not always align with their duties, and their research achievements are minimal. In the future, the number of part-time faculty members should be reduced, and excellent and qualified full-time professors should be hired to guide research and improve teaching efficiency. 3. The allocation of funds in the school is unreasonable. Equipment expenses account for only 6%, leading to a significant lack of equipment. Office expenses account for 19%, exceeding the Ministry's standard by a large margin. The allocation should be revised, with equipment expenses no less than 15%. Office expenses and salaries should be strictly reduced to supplement equipment. 4. The equipment in the school's laboratories and factories, as well as instruments and specimens, are outdated and rudimentary. Most books, except for ancient texts, are outdated and do not meet the needs. Western books and magazines are scarce. The above three points should be implemented, and any remaining funds should be used to improve equipment. 5. The curriculum design of the school is inadequate and should be revised and implemented effectively. The departments of the School of Engineering should add physics and physics experiment courses, reduce mathematics hours, and complete them in the first and second years. Factory practice should begin in the first year. Surveying practice for the civil engineering and mining departments should be scheduled during the second-year summer vacation, with a duration of at least three weeks, and should be supervised by professors. 6. The teaching materials in the school are outdated lecture notes, and the content is not practical enough. The teaching methods are misguided, and there are few experiments. The course progress is not well-planned. The grades on various test papers are poor. The school should strengthen the training of newly admitted students to improve their level. 7. Moral education in the school is lax and lacks positive measures. Although the students are simple, many are spiritually decadent. In the future, faculty and staff should pay close attention to moral education, striving to cultivate a spirit of simplicity and hard work. The order requires compliance and sincere improvements to be reported."</p>
<p>Anhui University:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education also issued an order to Anhui Provincial Anhui University on the 2nd, stating, "The Ministry has previously issued key points to urge improvements. Based on the report of the inspectors, the school has generally paid attention to the implementation over the past year. However, the following points still need to be implemented and reported for review: 1. The School of Agriculture is approved to establish one class of agronomy this year. Enrollment should be strictly limited to 20 students. Training in basic subjects such as physics, chemistry, and biology should be emphasized, and equipment should be improved. 2. The school's physics and chemistry equipment, such as wireless electricity, gas and electricity communication, modern physics, and physics instrument repair room, are rudimentary. The gas plant and combustion chamber are missing. Psychological instruments are insufficient. There are very few complete sets of scientific journals. The above equipment should be added to facilitate teaching and practice. Sanitation and sports venues should also be established as soon as possible. 3. There are still too many part-time faculty members in the school, and many are unqualified. In the future, recruitment must be strictly controlled, and the number of part-time faculty members should be reduced. The full-time system should be implemented. The number of staff members should also be reduced. 4. Although the recruitment of new students and the restriction of leave and absence are slightly better than before, they still need to be strictly implemented to improve the level and quality. This order."</p>

<p>(Guangzhou Electric Dispatch) The opening ceremony of Children's Year in Guangzhou was held at 7:00 PM on the 1st, with over 10,000 children attending. After the ceremony, recreational activities were held, and the sounds of joy resounded.</p>
<p>National Mandarin Education Association</p>
<p>Telegram from Suzhou Urging Attention to Symbols</p>
<p>Promoting Local Dialects Aligns with Ministry Orders, Welcoming Children from Jiangsu and Shanghai to Participate</p>
<p>The Fangyin Committee of the National Mandarin Education Promotion Association is promoting Suzhou phonetic symbols, starting on August 1st of this year, which is National Children's Year. It is also seeking 1,000 young Suzhou dialect speakers to assist in the promotion. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting Local Dialects Aligns with Ministry Orders</p>
<p>The Fangyin Committee of the association promotes Suzhou phonetic symbols based on the Ministry of Education's order in May 1920, promoting phonetic symbols: "Thousands of symbols can annotate national sounds, or annotate local sounds. Teachers and students should all learn and practice them, making it easy to promote supplementary education for the public." And in July of the same year, the Ministry of Education ordered 25 measures for provinces, cities, and counties to promote phonetic symbols: "4. Provincial, city, and county departments should investigate local dialects. 5. Compile small booklets for learning local dialects with phonetic symbols, and pay attention to local homophones with symbols, explaining them in the local dialect to facilitate promotion." In 1922, the Ministry of Education ordered the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee to compile local phonetic symbols according to the important dialect regions of the country. The Suzhou phonetic symbols promoted this time are the latest revised version of the National Language Association. All activities are completely based on laws and regulations and are not in violation.</p>
<p>Welcoming Participation, Offering Textbooks</p>
<p>The first step in the association's promotion of Suzhou phonetic symbols is to use wireless transmission to teach, seeking 1,000 young Suzhou dialect speakers to assist in the promotion. Children aged 10 to 15 in Jiangsu and Shanghai are welcome to participate. Those willing to participate can obtain registration forms and methods from the Suzhou Park Library and the Shanghai He De Road Fo Yin Radio Station. Fill out the registration form and send it to the association at No. 3 Ping Le Li, Xizang Road, Shanghai. The association will immediately send a young Suzhou dialect speaker certificate and a Suzhou phonetic symbol textbook. At the end of one month, the association will reward young speakers with excellent results. The first prize is a scholarship of 30 yuan, the second prize is 10 yuan, the third prize is 5 yuan, the fourth to tenth prizes are 3 yuan each, the eleventh to twentieth prizes are 1 yuan each, and the twenty-first to one hundredth prizes are a piece of learning supplies each.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Programs Change Daily</p>
<p>The association will broadcast the Suzhou phonetic symbol textbook taught at the Shanghai Fo Yin Radio Station (980) from 2:15 PM to 3:00 PM daily, starting on August 1st. There will be one lesson per day, and classes will be held as usual on Sundays. Stories, novels, plays, riddles, folk songs, common sense, and popular tunes will also be broadcast, as well as prize-winning tests to help listeners' interest. All programs except textbook teaching will change daily. Please check the broadcasting news in various newspapers. The association and Shanghai Yamei Company jointly organize a radio Mandarin course, which is broadcasted non-stop every day from 5:20 PM (on Shanghai Broadcasting Station (1100).

The National Association of Chinese Youth Associations has specially added a tour itinerary to allow the representatives to visit scenic spots in China. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor's Welcome</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng of the city specially held a tea party yesterday to welcome the representatives of the International Junior Summer Camp from various countries and China. The location was originally set at the City Hall Auditorium, but later, in order to allow the representatives to visit the Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, at 2:30 PM yesterday, all the representatives took a special boat prepared by the municipal government to Gaoqiao and transferred to cars to the Seaside Bathing Beach.

<p>Departure to Qingdao Today</p>
<p>In addition to the representatives from Japan, Korea, and northern China, the representatives from the Philippines, Honolulu, and various places in southern China, including more than 60 people from Ningbo, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Nanjing, Yunnan, Hangzhou, and Xiamen, are scheduled to take the Xinjiang ship to Qingdao today and transfer to Yan'er Island to enter the camp. Zheng Hanjun, the executive secretary of the camp, and six Chinese leaders, including Tian Xingen, are also taking the same boat to Qingdao.</p>

The entire tour will last for 14 days.</p>
<p>Overview of the International Junior Summer Camp: Zhou Shang The types of summer camps are divided into youth, junior, children, and girl scout camps. The origin of summer camps comes from the outdoor camp life of European naval and army student groups and boy teams. When the Boy Scouts emerged, the training of tents became a temporary fashion.</p>
<p>In 1918, the United Kingdom promulgated Article 17 of the Education Ordinance, which clearly stipulated that local educational administrative organs should do their best to create or assist in running summer camps. Denmark, Sweden, and Germany have the most remarkable achievements. Summer camps in the United States are also springing up like mushrooms. Last year, there were 575 along the Pacific coast. Japan, a neighboring country, is also learning and imitating, with the potential to surpass others. In recent years, our country has also volunteered to do it. Everyone already knows about the children's health camps in Tianjin, Nanjing, and Shanghai.</p>
<p>The summer camps run by various countries have already made headway. Therefore, the Junior Department of the World YMCA Association in Geneva initiated the organization of the "Pacific International Junior Summer Camp." The first session was held in Japan in 1929, with more than 100 representatives from 13 countries. The second International Junior Summer Camp was held in Honolulu in 1931. At this time, our country began to send representatives to participate. 1933 was the third session, and the location was in the Philippines. This year is the fourth session. It was decided the year before last to set it up in our country. The current camp address is assumed to be Qingdao Yan'er Island. This island is surrounded by the sea on all sides, with beautiful scenery, willow branches like curtains, and ripples like 　. Swimming and boating are very convenient. The Shanghai Youth Association has already sent staff to prepare.</p>
<p>The purpose of this camp is to connect the young people of the Pacific countries, to discuss the situation of the countries and life issues with a friendly attitude, so to exchange knowledge, skills, and customs, to seek understanding between races, and to develop the personality and鍛鍊 body of young people at the same time are equally regarded as important goals. The value of this kind of camp can be said to be that one day, it can correct physical and psychological defects, secondly, develop good habits, thirdly, enlighten the mind and morality, fourthly, produce a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation, fifthly, approach the natural world, and sixthly, use leisure time to benefit the cultivation of temperament. In short, morality, health, and world harmony are the ideal goals of this camp and also the highest value of this camp.</p>
<p>Because this camp is hosted by the YMCA, the representatives from all places are also within the scope of the YMCA. It is estimated that about 122 people will participate this time, including 24 leaders from various countries. The participating countries include Japan, Korea, the United States, Hawaii, Canada, Siam, the Philippines, and other Pacific countries, as well as overseas Chinese living in the Far East. Our country has assigned 27 people from major cities such as Nanjing, Xiamen, Ningbo, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Changsha, Yantai, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Hankou, Hong Kong, Kaifeng, Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao, and invited 6 leaders. The qualifications of the representatives are limited to high school first and second-year students aged 16 to 19 and who are active.</p>
<p>The cost for each representative is about 54 yuan, including eight days of food, round-trip travel expenses from Shanghai to Qingdao, and registration fees, etc., but personal expenses are excluded. After the camp closes, a tour group will be organized for a two-week itinerary with voluntary participation. Places such as Beiping, Jinan, Qufu, Nanjing, and Hangzhou are all included in the program, and each person will need about 100 yuan. As for the daily routine of the camp, see the news in the education column of the August 2 newspapers, "Mayor Wu Welcomes the Representatives of the International Junior Summer Camp," so I will not waste words.</p>

<p>Ned was so engrossed in watching this exciting contest that he lost himself, and unknowingly he had gradually left his corner and ventured out. Later, a very active boy slid down the escalator, but because he used too much force, he couldn't control himself and fell off the escalator, slamming to the ground. Ned heard the sound and forgot himself, so he rushed to the person's side, thinking that he must have a broken head and be half dead. Who knew that the child's head had been constantly collided for eleven years, and it was as hard as a cannonball! So he just quickly blinked his eyes once, and after a while, he looked up at this new face quietly, and greeted him with surprise, shouting "Hello!" (Note 1)</p>
<p>(Note 1) Hallo is a greeting word to people, similar to the "hey" in our country. However, the Hallo here also implies a happy encounter, which seems to be difficult for the word "hey" to express completely, so it is translated directly.</p>
<p>"Hello," Ned also replied, because he didn't know if there was anything else to say, thinking that that kind of reply was the simplest and most convenient.</p>
<p>The youth on the ground didn't move at all, but asked, "Are you a new boy?"</p>
<p>"I don't know yet."</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Ned White."</p>
<p>"My name is Pang Tao Mo; would you like to go up and try it?" Tao Mo jumped up as if he suddenly remembered the responsibility of being a guest.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I still won't do it, let's see if I can stay here," Ned replied, but his desire to stay grew deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>"Hey, Xiao Qiao, here comes another one. Come and say hello to him;" said the energetic Tao Mo, and then returned to his original game, with the same interest as before.</p>
<p>The boy sitting on the stairs heard him call and raised a pair of big yellow eyes, looked up and stopped the child with a thin and kind face. There was a kind of attractive power in his appearance.</p>

<p>Rumors Amplify Buyer Momentum; Bid Reaches $900</p>
<p>Huge Increase of $16.60</p>
<p>Following the rebound from the earlier reversal, the gold market continued to thrive yesterday. Although momentarily dampened by the loose exchange market, persistent buying interest and supporting rumors led to another surge. Early morning analysis revealed that overseas silver markets in the UK and US were flat, while forward silver prices in Montreal either rose by one point or remained unchanged. London spot gold increased by one and a half pence, and exchange rates slightly appreciated. Overnight unofficial trading had already pushed prices higher, reinforcing market confidence. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened at $92.30, then retreated to $91.00, before rising again to $93.40. The morning opening was high, with the central bank's official rates announced as flat for both the UK and US, and the customs gold unit also unchanged. The gold bid standard price, however, rose again to $909.70 (?). Market sentiment was normal. Unexpectedly, the exchange market hardened, suggesting a lack of maintenance, and selling pressure intensified, driving prices below the $90 mark. Shanghai Bank's sell-off initially weakened the market, but foreign banks seized the opportunity to buy on the cheap, pulling prices back above $90. Subsequently, supply and demand varied, with Shanghai Bank heavily selling foreign exchange, while foreign banks bought. Anticipation of HSBC's rates, which remained flat for both the UK and US, led to an extremely mediocre market, characterized by brief rises and falls within a narrow range. Later, stronger bank buying appetite fueled a temporary surge, but large investors capitalized by supplying at the high, soon reversing the trend and leading to fluctuations. However, continued bank buying on the cheap provided support, resulting in a slight increase. Expectations for unchanged Indian silver further reduced trading volume, with little change in overall momentum. In the aftermarket, bank buying led to stabilization, and once buying interest was triggered, the exchange market tightened. The bank's inability to sell in large quantities gradually pushed prices above the $900 mark. Rumors of restrictions on paper currency redemption in Qingdao further boosted market confidence. Although Indian silver remained unchanged, there was a slight dip mid-session, swiftly offset by large investors scrambling to cover their positions.

<p>Bond Market Rises and Falls Based on Large Investor Activity</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was still flickering uncertainly. The trend had a slight downward tendency, but large investors absorbed bonds, supporting market prices, showing signs of fatigue and recovery. The situation may enter a winding path. The environmental news was dull, and people's minds were bewildered. There were many who followed the trend, so when large investors bought in, the market price rebounded slightly, and all scrambled to go long. When large investors slightly exited the market, they scrambled to sell short. Based on this speculation, there will likely be no drastic changes in the short term. Yesterday's experience was that retail investor sentiment was weak at the opening, and many sold out. The liquidation fell by half a yuan, and the Northern Help Eleventh and other bonds also sold out, and market conditions were quite sluggish. Most of them were just a small two or three jiao, and after that, the Fourth and Forty-eighth and other bonds absorbed a little, and the market stabilized. 96 rebounded two or three jiao due to the Fourth's hedging. In the next session, the popularity of various gangs turned slightly, and the Twenty-first, Twenty-third, and Forty-eighth and other bonds had advanced appetites, and the market situation suddenly turned to surge, and the market price suddenly rebounded in unison. After that, the upward trend became stronger and stronger, and the Twenty-third Guan soared by 6.5 jiao, and 96 continued to rise by about 3 jiao. The question is whether the upward trend has continued capacity. In the end, most of the market prices rose from one or two jiao to 6.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 10.072 million yuan. The results of the rise and fall are listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Has Plenty of Profit-Taking</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported yesterday (the 1st) that the New York stock market had plenty of profit-taking, and prices fell.

The bond market rose under the leadership of railroad bonds. Small exchange stocks had mixed rises and falls, with 1.89 million shares traded. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>

<p>Long and Short Compete Fiercely in Yarn Bidding</p>
<p>The yarn market is free to rise and fall, and the situation is as chaotic as hemp. General speculators have enthusiastic minds, and their views are inconsistent whether they are bullish or bearish. Moreover, rumors arise in the market. There is an unusually sufficient amount of long and short chips, so the range of changes is quite broad. The bulls discuss that the inventories are weak and buy blindly. As for what the sellers hold, the current yarn sales are sluggish, and the price has risen by more than 20 yuan compared with the low price. Both the long and short sides are in short-range contact.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Fluctuates, Unstable Yarn Bidding In the early market, the prices of the various months rose slightly by five or six jiao, but when they were filmed to the distant months, they fell slightly by</p>
<p>One or two jiao. When filming to the second or third session, it was heard that the current yarn sales were sluggish, and most of the transactions belonged to Japanese yarn. A downward trend suddenly arose, and the stage was quite weak, and the downward trend was fierce. As a result, the prices of each month fell by 1.467 yuan to 2.1 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. The opening of the afternoon market was still flat. When filming to the distant months, they suddenly showed off, the second or third session of the rising trend was fierce, because the bid money soared, breaking out of the $900 mark, and rumors suddenly arose in the market, saying that the matter of inflation would be realized again. So the buyers took the opportunity to raise the price, but the turnover was not strong. As a result, the prices of each month rose by 1.7 jiao to 2.2 jiao compared with the closing price of the morning. It was found that Jifeng sold 900 bales, Dafu 2,200 bales, Tongji 800 bales, Zhenda 1,300 bales, Junchang 1,200 bales, Senkang 900 bales, Yuanyi 900 bales, Changfeng 1,200 bales, Dachang 450 bales, Shenji 550 bales, Runkang 400 bales, Shengyuan 500 bales, Yongchang 550 bales, Tongfu bought 1,200 bales, Meiji 500 bales, Jinchang 1,100 bales, Ruidata 3,500 bales, Shenji 900 bales, Yichang 1,050 bales, Xincheng 1,150 bales, Dafeng 450 bales, Senkang 750 bales, Renfeng 750 bales.

<p>The cotton market started to fall and then rise, and the August trend was more relaxed. Because the bulls swapped the futures, the distant months were still tight. The climate has been good recently, and the new cotton production has been smooth. Some of the distant months were sold short at high prices, but the bulls were still pulling in due to the inflation problem, which was still rumored. The amount of pull-in has not been released after all.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao is Uneven Cotton Bidding In the early market, the prices of each month fell uniformly because the US cotton fell back and the bid price was calm. The second or third session continued to fall, and the cotton market was particularly weak due to the sluggish yarn. As a result, the prices of each month fell by 0.3 yuan to 0.45 yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon market, the market situation suddenly became tight, and although the buyers were not strong, the trend was quite strong. The bid money broke out of the $900 mark and reached $907. The rumors of inflation were rampant again, and the floating households were eager to hedge. As a result, the prices of each month rose by 0.3 yuan to 0.6 yuan compared with the closing price of the morning. It was found that Xinheng sold 2,900 loads, Yongda 2,800 loads, Jifeng 1,500 loads, Tongji 1,200 loads, Changyu 2,400 loads, Tongxing 3,000 loads, Changfeng 3,000 loads, Runkang 2,200 loads, Yuanxingchang 4,400 loads, Xinhua 2,000 loads, Changhe 1,300 loads, Dachang 1,400 loads, Changfeng bought 5,500 loads, Runkang 1,300 loads, Dafu 6,300 loads, Dafeng 3,400 loads, Ruidata 2,900 loads, Shenji 1,700 loads, Yongda 2,200 loads, Yikang 1,300 loads Mingde 1,100 loads, Renfeng 1,700 loads.

<p>Possibility of Borrowing Two-Point Interest</p>
<p>US Cotton Traders Advance Near and Out Far</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was quiet and stagnant. Traders were still waiting for the announcement of the new cotton borrowing. The news from Liverpool was not good, the weather was good, and the wheat market was weak, all of which were the reasons for the small drop in the early morning. The trend in the market was to buy near and sell</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai electricity, the opening forecast for the white Luo Creek cotton in the April-May period on the 2nd was 216 Robis, which was 1.75 Robis lower than the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the turbulent market, a commotion and decline, Zhonglei fierce, with foreign teaching prices, the current wheat stopped being annoyed... only the package was not opened</p>
<p>Floating Air Plus Code</p>
<p>Futures Wheat Plunged Seven or Eight Points</p>
<p>Current Wheat Stagnant... Only Package Not Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, saw a continuous sharp drop in each month. The price of foreign wheat fell back by 24 jiao. The minds of people inside and outside the industry, with the rumor of currency in front, speculative customers, have absorbed one after another. Now that things have passed, most of the floating longs are eager to close out. The floating shorts who take advantage of the situation are frequently adding codes, resulting in a consistent loosening and falling in the near and far periods. However, the quotation of wheat in the mainland has not been affected. In the future, unless the foreign wheat continues to be fixed, the market will not be too loose. As a result, this month fell by 6 points, September fell by 4 points, October fell by 7 points, November fell by 7 points, December fell by 8 points. The factory side of the current wheat, with the continuous decline in the price of flour and wheat in the future, intends to reduce the purchase, and the owners are unwilling to sell cheaply because the cost is high, so the unified market has no package transaction.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat</p>
<p>Dumi Ke's Sales are Gradually Moving</p>
<p>—Foreign Rice Arrives, Scarcity and Gradual Rise—</p>
<p>Yesterday's source of customers for Benmi (South Shanghai) still arrived on the 14th and 15th, (the goods totaled nearly 3,000 shi), so people's minds continued to be stable, and the sales market was quite refreshing. If the stores on this street had a special taste, the morning market was very active, and the package flavors also had more than 500 packages of Tianjin Qingdao and other dealers, so the prices of various thick japonica rice rose again by two or three jiao. Wan rice was good for a few jiao, Dongxin japonica rice was calm, Lujian was proud, and Yinyuan accounted for freshness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various roads under the river were on the 26th and 27th, and the various goods on the market went away. The white japonica rice was still continuing to transform in the early morning market, and the price was still shouting for an increase of one or two jiao. Later, because the store's acceptance of the taste turned lazy, it was calm until the closing. The arrival of Dongxin japonica rice was quite strong, about 700 shi, and the retail transaction was active, and the price was fixed. The goods were scarce and the price increased by two or three jiao in the early rice. The price also increased by two jiao in the thin rice, and the delivery of Baiyuan was less, the sales were still good, and the price increased by two or three jiao. The rest of the goods were slightly tight.</p>
<p>Foreign</p>
<p>The market for rice yesterday, inheriting the turbulent and rising situation of the past few days, the minds of merchants and hoarders became more determined, and the inventories gradually decreased, the delivery and settlement were both exhausted, and the foothold was quite stable. Although the taste of the customers was weak yesterday, the market continued to rise by five or six points. 5,000 packages of Saigon, 1,500 packages of small strangulation, 2,000 packages of Siam, and 50 packages of Mintang Su japonica rice and other places were opened throughout the city, and they were distributed by the local Jiujiang Nanjing Ningbo and other places. The situation remained strong, and if the customer transformation became more prosperous, it might be necessary to step into the brickwork.</p>
<p>New Soybeans from Ganliu Fangchi are on the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, a batch of new soybeans from Gan Province's Liu Fangchi was shipped, totaling 23 packages, and the goods were of good quality and the identity was also dry, but the grains were slightly small and stiff, and they were also opened at 3.88 yuan. The red bridge beans continued to arrive with 33 packages, the goods were inferior, and the price was opened at 3.83 yuan. The market situation was 1 point, and they were all distributed to scattered households on this street. Because the new soybeans were on the market, the old soybeans were sleeping and surging, and people's minds were leading. The destination turned active, and the market price showed a steady increase. The soybean cake and the rotten goods were still woven, and the market atmosphere was inevitably super tight, and the upper and lower afternoons started by one point.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Talking About Single-Button Carbon Granule Microphones <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Huaxin</p>
<p>In wireless broadcasting machines, carbon granule microphones are generally used. In more sophisticated broadcasting machines, condenser microphones and moving coil microphones are also used. Carbon granule microphones can be divided into two types: single-button and double-button. Single-button carbon granule microphones are mostly used in wired telephones, while double-button carbon granule microphones and other styles are mostly used in broadcasting machines. However, the biggest advantage of single-button carbon granule microphones is that they output the most with the same intensity of sound wave input, thus avoiding multi-stage amplification devices. The degree of distortion can be reduced to a minimum with proper adjustment. Due to the above advantages, single-button carbon granule microphones are most commonly used in amateur circles.</p>
<p>Its structure is shown in the first diagram. A is an elastic diaphragm, fixed to the microphone cover E with rubber bands FF. B'B are two carbon plates, with B' being fixed and B connected to the diaphragm A, vibrating along with it. C is extremely fine carbon granules between plates B and B'. G is a mica sheet, H is an insulated cover, and D is a circle of insulating paper on the four walls of the box. B and B' plates are also the connecting posts of the microphone. When we connect a DC power source to B and B' plates, current flows from plate B through the carbon granules to plate B', or from plate B' through the carbon granules to plate B. At the same time, when we speak into the microphone, the diaphragm A vibrates with the sound waves. This vibration is transmitted to plate B. Because plate B' is fixed, the carbon granules between the two plates are subjected to different pressures. According to the characteristics of the carbon granules, the resistance between plates B and B' either increases or decreases accordingly, and the current flowing through either increases or decreases accordingly. It is inversely proportional to the resistance and directly proportional to the pressure (the resistance of carbon granules is inversely proportional to the pressure). Because the pressure is directly proportional to the sound wave, the waveform of the current change is exactly the same as the sound wave, achieving the purpose of using the microphone.</p>
<p>The current that can pass through the microphone is very small. If the current exceeds a certain limit, sparks will occur between the carbon granules, rendering it useless. The maximum current that ordinary single-button microphones can pass is approximately one-tenth of an ampere. When there are no sound waves acting, the resistance is approximately 50 to 100 ohms, and the maximum power consumption is o.ixo.ixoo, equaling one watt. In addition, there is a low-impedance single-button carbon granule microphone with a resistance of approximately 10 to 20 ohms. The maximum current limit is half an ampere, and the maximum power consumption is five watts.</p>
<p>The maximum amplitude of diaphragm A in ordinary microphones is approximately four-thousandths of a millimeter, 0.0025mm. If the amplitude is too large, the waveform of the output current cannot be the same as the sound wave. For example, if the sound wave received by the microphone is a sine wave, when the amplitude of the diaphragm does not exceed four-thousandths of a millimeter, the output current is also a sine waveform. If the amplitude gradually increases beyond the limit, the waveform of the output current will not be a pure sine wave, but a combination of sine waves and their odd and even harmonics, resulting in distortion. The degree of distortion increases or decreases according to the amount the diaphragm amplitude exceeds the limit.</p>
<p>In application, the combination of a single-button carbon granule microphone and the amplification stage uses an amplitude modulation transformer (see the second diagram). The mixed resistance of its primary stage is approximately 100 or 200 ohms. The microphone power supply can use a six-volt DC power supply, and a 100 or 200 ohm potentiometer can be connected across the power supply to adjust to the most suitable voltage. The secondary stage of the microphone transformer is connected to a 100,000 ohm potentiometer to manage the output voltage.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Wireless Electricity Cures Cancer <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>The uses of wireless electricity are endless. In addition to communication, there are various unexpected applications. With various wireless electricity therapeutic devices, our lives have an extra layer of protection. Even "cancer," which has always been considered difficult to cure, has recently been treated with definite and rapid methods using mysterious wireless electricity waves.</p>
<p>George Lakhovsky has devoted the most effort to the issue of treating cancer with wireless electricity waves. Lakhovsky initially used electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of two meters to treat plants suffering from white tumors caused by a type of tumor-causing microorganism. In the first few days of the trial, the disease seemed to grow and spread, but dozens of days later, the tumor suddenly disappeared and gradually healed. Lakhovsky thus discovered that cancer could be treated with electromagnetic waves and delved into further research.</p>
<p>Later, Lakhovsky created a type of ultra-shortwave oscillator that could simultaneously emit various different wavelengths, and the experimental results were even better. At this time, more and more people became interested in this issue, and continued research sprung up like mushrooms. One time, an experiment was conducted on 300 cancer patients, and the results were extremely good. Two cases, previously considered hopeless, were completely cured.</p>
<p>Six years ago, Lakhovsky designed another type of amplitude-modulated wave transmitter that could simultaneously emit various wavelengths from 400 meters to 10 centimeters. Due to the effects of harmonics, interference, and heterodyne, waves with wavelengths close to infrared radiation and even equal to the wavelengths of light visible to the human eye were actually present simultaneously. The experimental results of this machine were extremely good. Even terminal illnesses that could not be treated with X-rays and radium pills could be cured with ease. Lakhovsky also claimed that this type of cancer treatment device did not cause artificial fever during application.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Lakhovsky’s New Electrical Therapy Machine <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<h3 id="e181">Economical Small AC Two-Tube Radio <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>—Improvement of AC/DC Radio—</p>
<p>I recently assembled a two-tube radio. The vacuum tubes used were a 6C6 and a 12A7 each. The former handles the work of a single-stage feedback detection, and the latter's task is low-frequency amplification and rectification. The experimental results show that, apart from the average selectivity, other aspects such as sensitivity and sound quality are quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>The circuit diagram of this machine is shown in the figure, and the numerical values and capacities of each component are detailed in the diagram. This machine has a wide range of radio wavelengths, from 10 meters to 500 meters, all of which can be listened to without missing anything. A total of six 1.25-inch radius four-pin plug-in coils are used. The design of the bands and coils is omitted due to limited space.</p>
<p>This machine can be used with 110 volt or 220 volt AC power sources. The B voltage is directly taken from the commercial AC power source and then obtained by rectification and filtering. The filament voltage is taken from the transformer after voltage reduction.</p>
<p>Although two vacuum tubes with different filament voltages are used in the machine, only one filament secondary coil of the power transformer is used. This is nothing more than a slight consideration, and it is not difficult to understand the reason. It is said that mass-produced radios mostly use this method to supply various vacuum tubes in the machine. Its economic convenience can be imagined.</p>
<p>Although this machine can only be used with AC power, its economic use of electricity is truly unmatched by AC/DC machines (the power consumption of this machine is less than about 10 watts, while if the machine is used as an AC/DC type, it must consume at least 50 watts or more).</p>
<p>If you want to make the power transformer yourself, you can stack 1.52 pounds of silicon steel sheets to 26 mm. The primary coil should be wound with 2,400 turns of No. 36 enameled wire, and a tap should be taken at the halfway point for use with a 110 volt power source. The secondary coil should be wound with 128 turns of No. 24 enameled wire, and a tap should be taken at 64 turns for the 6C6 filament. For the winding procedure and matters that should be paid attention to, please refer to Mr. Xuelun's masterpiece in Issue 122 of this magazine.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Steps for Assembling a Radio for Beginners (Conclusion) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Xuelun</p>
<p>(4) Adding a High-Frequency Amplification Stage</p>
<p>The function of high-frequency amplification is to amplify the weak high-frequency signal received by the vacuum tube and then input it to the detection stage, so that the detection tube can obtain a considerable voltage, so the efficiency is very high, and high-frequency transformers are usually adjustable, so selectivity and sensitivity can be increased. In areas where there are many radio stations, or if you want to receive broadcasts from distant places, it is advisable to add a high-frequency amplification stage.</p>
<p>Now, you must first remove the original spider web board and replace it with a cylindrical coil. Take two Bakelite tubes with a diameter of 32 mm and a length of 76 mm. The coil winding method is as follows:</p>
<p>High-Frequency Transformer Take a Bakelite tube and wind 105 turns of No. 30 enameled wire for L1. At a distance of 3 mm, wind 24 turns of the same wire for L. The starting end of L1 is connected to the grid of the high-frequency amplification tube, and the ending end is grounded. The starting end of L is grounded, and the ending end is connected to the antenna. The two coils are in the same direction.</p>
<p>Detection Coil Take another Bakelite tube and wind 105 turns of No. 30 enameled wire for L3. Then, with No. 36 enameled wire, wind 45 turns for L4 at a distance of 3 mm from the ending end of L3. Then, take a 20 mm wide insulating paper and wrap a layer on L3. Wind 50 turns of No. 36 enameled wire for L2. The starting end of L2 is connected to the plate of the high-frequency amplification tube, and the ending end is connected to the B positive. The starting end of L3 is connected to the grid capacitor, and the ending end is grounded. The starting end of L4 is connected to the high-frequency coil, and the ending end is connected to the plate of the detection tube. The direction of the three coils is the same.</p>
<p>When assembling a radio, everyone knows that the most difficult thing to assemble is the high-frequency amplification stage, but the high-frequency amplification stage does not have profound theories or require clever technology. It is just that high-frequency amplification is prone to induction, and the amount of induction between the secondary coil of the high-frequency transformer and the secondary coil of the detection must be absolutely the same. Therefore, in addition to using aluminum isolation shields for the two coils, aluminum shields must also be used to isolate the No. 39 and No. 36 vacuum tubes to prevent mutual power effects.</p>
<p>After the new high-frequency amplification stage is connected, the entire radio is completed. The circuit is shown in Figure 6. At this time, it is best to carefully check for any errors, then connect the power source, turn on the power switch, and slowly rotate the dial and potentiometer. When the speaker emits a whistle, turn the potentiometer knob back a little until the oscillation stops properly. At this time, a very clear sound can be emitted from the speaker. If the volume is too low, or the sound is unclear, or it makes strange noises, you can adjust the compensation capacitor of the dual-gang variable capacitor. If it is still not clear, it is because the secondary coils differ too much and must be rewound. The components used are as follows:</p>
<p>L, L1 High-Frequency Transformer winding method see this article</p>
<p>L2, L3, L4 Detection Coil winding method see this article</p>
<p>R 500 ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>R1 75,000 ohm fixed resistor</p>
<p>C 5 trillionth farad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>C1 Trillionth farad fixed capacitor</p>
<p>V No. 39 or No. 44 vacuum tube</p>
<p>The article Steps for Assembling a Radio for Beginners has been serialized three times, occupying a lot of valuable space in this magazine. The author deeply apologizes. In the second continuation of this article, the power transformer section, the secondary high voltage was found to be wrong. It was mistakenly copied from the manuscript for use with vacuum tubes such as 6D6 and 6F1. It should be changed to a secondary high voltage of 400 volts, wound with 1,680 turns of American standard No. 32 wire, and a center tap should be drawn.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Simple Two-Tube Shortwave Radio <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>The receiving range of a shortwave radio is far beyond that of a broadcast radio. An ordinary two-tube radio with a single-stage regenerative detection and a single-stage audio frequency amplification is considered to have achieved excellent results if it can receive broadcasts from 1,000 to 2,000 miles away. If a shortwave radio with the same conditions is used, it is not difficult to receive shortwave broadcasts from Europe, or even telecommunications from the United States on the opposite side of the earth, can be easily received from a small two-tube shortwave radio. This article introduces how to make a simple two-tube shortwave radio as a preliminary tool for us to develop shortwave treasures.</p>
<p>Please see the attached diagram for the circuit diagram of this radio. The numerical values of the components are marked in the diagram. A total of four plug-in coils are used? The wavelength received ranges from 10 meters to 200 meters, covering all shortwave wavelengths. Please see the table below for the number of turns, wire number, and winding method of L1 and L2. The wiring method is as shown in another attached diagram. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e184">Miscellaneous Notes <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xianwen</p>
<p>(1) Thoughts on Photoelectric Tubes:</p>
<p>Photoelectric tubes are considered a fashionable and useful item in the modern scientific community. Many precise instruments or machines use them. Ordinary people always think that their eyes are reliable, but when compared to this electric eye (another name for photoelectric tubes), they are far behind. Sensitive photoelectric tubes can easily detect the light emitted by a candle 3 kilometers away. Because it has such sensitivity, it is often used for precise detection work, such as sound movies, stellar photometry, picture transmission, television, and automatic light signals.</p>
<p>(2) Properties of Sound:</p>
<p>The sound we usually hear has a certain limit to its vibration frequency (the average person hears between 20 and 10,000 times per second), but its intensity, if less than or greater than a certain value, cannot be distinguished or causes a painful sensation. The minimum sound that can be heard (meaning that sounds smaller than this point cannot be heard) has an intensity called the Threshold of Audibility. If the intensity of the sound slowly increases until it reaches the point of causing pain, this intensity is called the Threshold of Feeling. The intensity of sound required for the Threshold of Audibility and the Threshold of Feeling varies with the frequency of the sound. Their relationship is briefly summarized below:</p>
<p>Sound Frequency Threshold of Audibility Threshold of Feeling</p>
<p>(3) Thoughts on Vacuum Tubes:</p>
<p>The filament current of the vacuum tube in the radio should be kept to a minimum within the possible range, but without reducing the effectiveness. This is because it can prolong the life of the vacuum tube. The Operating Voltage of an ordinary vacuum filament is 90% of its Rated Voltage, and the effectiveness is not reduced. This little knowledge should be noted by economical amateurs.</p>

<h3 id="e185">What I Hope from the Commercial Press <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Sumin</p>
<p>The Commercial Press is the largest publisher in China, and everyone knows this. The morality and knowledge of its general manager, Mr. Wang Yunwu, his managerial talent, the efforts of his internal staff, and the excellence of its organization are also admired by everyone. Since January 28th, the Commercial Press has worked even harder, and the number of new books published has been increasing day by day, which is a good phenomenon in our cultural world.</p>
<p>However, it is precisely because we respect and love the Commercial Press that we have even greater hopes and stricter criticisms of it. Based on this motivation, I would like to share some of my personal hopes for it.</p>
<p>The low level of the publishing industry in China today is a reflection of the low level of knowledge and education in our society. There are few good books that are compiled and written, and even fewer good translated books. Most translated books are just black words piled on white paper, making them impossible to read. Because of my usual faith in the Commercial Press, I naturally "look at" the books it publishes with different eyes. To be fair, its books are generally better. However, when I read them carefully one by one, I also feel that there are few good ones and many bad ones. Even translated books are full of errors. The reason for this can be traced back to two points:——</p>
<p>1. Being too polite and sentimental to "celebrities" while simultaneously paying too much attention to temporary profits. The works of celebrities should be good. However, some celebrities in China are created by "bragging." Although the bragging is big, the knowledge and writing are still shallow. For example, a recent famous work by a certain celebrity published by the Commercial Press, if viewed from the perspective of a foreign university professor looking at a undergraduate student's graduation thesis, is simply "failing," or at least should be "rewritten." First, because the title of the book does not match the content. Second, because the translations used in the book are inconsistent. Third, because there are too many contradictions and errors in the book's content. However, the Commercial Press published the book without changing a word! The book costs three or four dollars, and buying it is regretful. From the "content" point of view, it is just a waste of a few dollars. However, "laymen" will regard it as a "masterpiece" and take it as an "authority." The harm of this "erroneous doctrine" far outweighs the loss of a few dollars. This cannot but be said to be that the editorial department of the Commercial Press is too sentimental to "celebrities." I hope that the Commercial Press will strictly review the content of manuscripts in the future, regardless of the author's name.</p>
<p>However, surprisingly, such a book that cannot pass the test, and at a selling price of more than three or four dollars in China today with its devastated economy, has surprisingly become a bestseller with a third reprint. From a profit-seeking point of view, the Commercial Press has a high vision, and I have a low vision; that book is beneficial to the Commercial Press. However, this kind of sales is temporary and cannot last. Because most people who buy books, like me, buy one to learn from the celebrity's boasting. However, after reading it, they realize that they have been greatly deceived and dare not recommend others to buy it again. Therefore, even for the sake of profit, the editors of the Commercial Press should advise the author to slightly modify the title and content and then publish it again, so that sales may be sustainable. Why value temporary profits?</p>
<p>2. Emphasizing quantity over quality and not being strict in selecting manuscripts. The Commercial Press releases new books every day. In terms of quantity, it is not small in China's current situation. However, books are different from ordinary commodities and cannot be "mass-produced." People who buy books want to take the books to study in order to gain knowledge and learning. If they open it and immediately find that the content is superficial, or even the reasoning is unclear, making them confused; or even the format is incomplete, such as the source of materials, reference books, etc., not mentioning a word. If it is a translated version, there are several sentences on one page that are incomprehensible, or even entire paragraphs that are incomprehensible, then what is the use of such books? The books of the Commercial Press are relatively good, but there are still many books of this kind. I hope that the editors of the Commercial Press will be stricter in selecting manuscripts in the future. The so-called strictness does not necessarily mean rejecting manuscripts; that is, for acceptable manuscripts, detailed annotations should be made on the places that should be deleted and revised, so that the author or translator can make their own deletions and revisions before publishing them. This is also a method of strictness. If it is a specialized book, it is best to have experts in the editorial department review it, or occasionally invite outside experts to review it, which is also possible.</p>
<p>The above two hopes can be applied to the general publishing industry. However, I am specifically saying this to the Commercial Press because, with the Commercial Press's qualifications and abilities, it is easier to implement and can take the lead in promoting it in order to improve the quality of publications.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Japan's Ordinary Publishing Law <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zongkai</p>
<p>The types of laws applicable to publishing in Japan can be divided into ordinary publishing and newspaper publishing. Ordinary publishing is publishing that is subject to the "Publishing Law" and is further divided into so-called ordinary publishing and subscription publishing. Subscription publishing is publishing that is subject to the "Subscription Publishing Law" in addition to the "Publishing Law." Newspaper publishing is publishing that is subject to the "Newspaper Law."</p>
<p>So-called ordinary publishing refers to publishing that is subject to the "Publishing Law" but not subject to the provisions of the "Subscription Publishing Law" and the "Newspaper Law." Not only are standalone books, paintings, maps, photographs, etc., considered ordinary publishing, but also publications such as magazines that record academics, skills, statistics, and advertisements.</p>
<p>1. Persons Responsible for Ordinary Publishing</p>
<p>In Japan, authors, publishers, and printers are all responsible for publishing to a certain extent. These people are called "persons responsible for publishing." Let's explain them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Authors According to the Japanese "Publishing Law," an author refers to writing, compiling documents, and creating drawings. For notes of speeches or lectures, the speaker or lecturer is the author. However, if the reporter, speaker, or lecturer permits self-publication, the notetaker is considered the author. The compiler of a book is the author; the translator is the author; the school, company, association, etc., that publishes, is the representative who submits the report to the authorities with their signature.</p>
<p>(2) Publisher According to the Japanese "Publishing Law," a publisher refers to someone who is responsible for selling and distributing. The publisher is not limited to the author and their heirs, but must be someone who is in the business of selling documents and drawings.</p>
<p>(3) Printer According to the Japanese "Publishing Law," a printer refers to someone who is responsible for printing. However, it does not refer to someone who is responsible for individual printing activities, but someone who is responsible for all printing activities. Therefore, someone who owns a printing shop is considered a printer, and if a printing shop is jointly owned by several people, the person who represents the printing shop in business is considered the printer.</p>
<p>2. Publishing Reports</p>
<p>The Japanese "Publishing Law" stipulates that when publishing documents and drawings, the author must submit two copies of the published work to the Ministry of Internal Affairs within three days from the date of publication, excluding the number of days it takes to arrive. When a government office publishes, it must send two copies of the published work to the Ministry of Internal Affairs before publication. The reporting form must be jointly submitted by the author or their heirs and the publisher, but for non-sale items, only the author and the publisher need to submit the report. If the publication is not protected by copyright, or if the author or their heirs are unknown, only the publisher needs to submit the report. For publications from schools, companies, associations, etc., the report must be jointly submitted by the representative and the publisher.</p>
<p>If additional volumes are added and published sequentially, it is necessary to report each time. However, for magazines, etc., if permission is obtained from the Minister of Internal Affairs, the reporting procedure can be omitted, and only the published work needs to be submitted. When reprinting, no report is necessary except in cases where corrections, additions, subtractions, and the addition of annotations, appendices, and drawings are made. For special publications such as letters, communications, reports, association rules, leaflets, and photographs, it is not necessary to complete the reporting procedures at all. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e187">From Writing to Publishing (3) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Importance</p>
<p>How is the paper mold made? It involves giving the typeset and proofread letterpress to the mold-making workers, who then use paste to glue multiple layers of paper together. They place this paper onto the letterpress and tap it with a large brush. Don't think just anyone can do this job. If you are an amateur, and you hit it a few times, breaking the paper, you have to replace it. If you are not careful when tapping, the paper will shift, and the strokes of the characters will become doubled; if you tap unevenly, some areas will be clear while others are unclear. The book cast from this plate will be blurry and unreadable, and no one will buy it.</p>
<p>After the paper mold is made, it must be placed on a stove to be pressed and dried. If it is not pressed well, or if the heat is insufficient, the paper mold will be useless. If the heat is too high, the paper mold might burn, and the lead type of the letterpress will also be destroyed, so extreme care is required during drying.</p>
<p>Nowadays, large newspaper offices use machines to make paper molds. This is not only done well, but it also takes less time. For example, making a paper mold manually takes one hour, while a machine takes less than two minutes. They use a special, thick foreign paper for making these molds. Just place the letterpress on the machine and press it, and it's done. It is evident that machine industry is much better than manual labor.</p>
<p>Casting the Plate</p>
<p>After the paper mold is made, it is sent to the plate-casting workers. They use a machine to hold the paper mold in place and pour molten lead into it. When opened, it becomes a lead plate identical to the letterpress. This lead plate is much more convenient to use on the printing press than the letterpress. However, casting lead plates also requires skilled workers to do well. If the lead is too hot or not hot enough, or if the paper mold is damp, the cast will have flaws and cannot be used for printing. Skilled workers can cast a usable plate almost every time, rarely needing to recast one. Unskilled workers often cast several plates in a row, none of which are suitable. An ordinary paper mold can be cast more than ten times. A not-so-good paper mold becomes useless after being cast six or seven times.</p>
<p>If zinc plates are used in the middle of the typeset when the lead plate is cast, the zinc plate areas must be repaired by the workers because the character feet of the zinc plates are shallow. If not repaired, the surrounding areas will get ink during printing. Repairing lead plates is not easy either; if you're not careful, you can damage the characters. Skilled workers will not damage them, and even if they do, they can plate some lead onto it and repair it to be the same as before.</p>
<p>If a paper mold has been made, you can correct any uncorrected typos on the paper mold. If a lead plate has already been cast and then you discover a typo, the workers can dig and correct it for you on the lead plate; however, if the book has been printed, there is no way to dig and correct it on the book.</p>
<p>Printing</p>
<p>Once the lead plate is cast, it can be placed on the printing press to print the book. However, the book is a small booklet, and the paper is a large sheet, so one large sheet of paper must be printed with several pages of the book. The size of the book is not fixed; there are octavo, duodecimo, sextodecimo, 20-mo, 23-mo, 24-mo, 25-mo, 32-mo, 36-mo, 40-mo, 46-mo, 50-mo, 60-mo, 64-mo, and even 128-mo sizes. The arrangement of the lead plate is different for each size. If one plate is arranged incorrectly, the page order will be reversed during binding, so it not only requires care, but it is simply not an easy job. If you arrange one plate incorrectly and discover the error later, the resulting compensation you have to pay will be enormous!</p>
<p>Also, attention must be paid to aesthetics. If one plate is arranged too high or too low, or is crooked, losing the unity of the whole book, the book will lose its aesthetic appeal. Moreover, even if it is unified, if the head and tail margins are too high or too low, or if the plate's position is too far in or out, it will also lose its aesthetic appeal. Furthermore, it might cause the characters to be bound or cut off during binding, which is not only unaesthetic but simply turns it into a pile of waste paper. So, it may seem that the machine is printing the book and the workers are merely moving the paper, which is very easy, but once you see all this, you will know that everyone's job is not easy.</p>
<p>Let me tell you some more about the issues when printing books, which are paper and ink. Paper can be glossy or matte, thick or thin. Glossy paper is easy to print on, while matte paper is not; paper with moderate thickness is easy to print on, while paper that is too thick or too thin is not. Furthermore, there are many names and types of paper, and each type of paper has different paper properties, such as being hard, loose, smooth, or brittle. Because of these different properties, they absorb ink differently, so one must understand the properties of the paper and what kind of ink to use, which will reduce difficulties during printing.</p>
<p>After the book is printed, it is sent to the binding workshop (i.e., bookbinding factory) to be bound into a book.</p>
<p>Binding</p>
<p>Binding is the final procedure in making a book. After the book is printed on the machine, it is sent to the binding workshop, where they first cut the large sheets of paper into small sheets, and then send them to the workers to fold them page by page. Most of these book-folding workers are women. After folding, the binding workers take them and, according to the page order, place them on the table, arranging them into book blocks, and then bind them.</p>
<p>There are several binding methods, such as "thread binding," where thread is used to sew through the fold of each section; "perfect binding," where three holes are punched near the spine and sewn with thread; and "wire stitching," where wire is used instead of thread. The first two are done manually, while the last one is done by machine. This refers to small-scale binding workshops. In large binding workshops, all types of binding are generally done by machine instead of manual labor. However, "wire stitching" is used for binding magazines and other thin publications because it is faster. As for thick books, it is generally not used because the wire rusts easily and can damage the book.</p>
<p>The binding styles include Western binding with cloth covers, Japanese binding with flat spines, French binding with uncut edges, and fine Chinese binding. After the book block is bound, the cover is then applied. Speaking of the cover, it is also quite troublesome. Hardcover books require gold stamping, and paperback books require color printing. The book cover design also takes a lot of effort from the designer, as an unaesthetic design will significantly reduce the reader's desire to purchase the book. After it is bound, it is then packaged and sent out for sale.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The window display during book sales and the design of advertisements also require a lot of effort from people, but we won't talk about that for now. Just looking at the procedures from writing to publishing a book, one already feels the amount of trouble and effort it takes. The above is the common knowledge of publishing. I hope the readers won't think it's too brief and not worth reading! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e188">Another Modern Account <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Last year, because it was the Year of Women's National Products, the Customs Office released alarming figures about the import of women's consumables, which caused many people to criticize women, believing that they were extravagant and unpatriotic. This year, the responsibility of the Year of National Products has shifted from women to students, so it naturally no longer attracts people's attention. However, we believe that the Year of National Products should not become a kind of play, with one act being performed and then another being switched out, with the aim of perfunctorily dealing with the present and deceiving the audience below the stage. Therefore, we don't mind being verbose and going against the ears of the "modern" misses and grandmothers, and talking about this matter again.</p>
<p>According to a conversation between the National Tariff Commission and reporters, "In the first half of this year alone, the import of women's consumables such as perfumes and cosmetics reached 558,770 national currency units, with no significant decrease compared to the same period last year. Among them, imports from the United States, Japan, and France were the most numerous, mostly consumed by the modern women of Shanghai," and so on. Naturally, this is only a small part of the spending on face and body. If the various clothes, jewelry, utensils, and so on are included in the statistics, the "alarming" figure would be more than this.</p>
<p>This figure is insignificant compared to the trade deficit of several hundred million yuan, but its seriousness lies in the fact that it is a non-productive expenditure. The large-scale import of these luxury consumables does not promote the domestic production industry, and shows that our women are now competing to be "modern." It cannot be denied that "love of beauty" is almost a human nature, but this "modern" trend contains countless evils and consequences. First, women's makeup and beauty lead to many things that are immoral and lose integrity, causing many romantic debts. The result is that women will inevitably suffer losses. Secondly, because of the influence of this "unrestrained extravagance of women," the entire society is also led into a situation of decadence and luxury. Naturally, "decadent ideas spread," and the result is the decline of social morals and the demise of people's will. Naturally, we do not stand on the side of the "defenders of the Way" to advocate "restoring old morality" or "changing customs," but in order to curb the growth of "servility" and to recover the determination and will to strive for independence and liberation, we are against this evil of women "forgetting reality."</p>
<p>For this reason, we have opened another general account of women's "modernity," hoping that women can receive some alarm, not just heartfelt words.</p>
<h3 id="e189">A Glimpse of Shi Qi <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>The night in the big cities of the South is rampant. The glamorous embankment, with its towering buildings, exudes a fascinating light, along with the dazzling street lights on the wharf. The crowds of people, the shouts of the coolies, form an uneasy night, and noisy sounds are moving and disturbing. At this moment, I, again with the traveler's absent-minded feeling, stepped into the cabin, letting it take me flying in the dark night of the sea, flowing downstream - the river surface at night is dark, like a devil opening its mouth wide, appearing unusually calm and desolate. Apart from hearing the unchanging sound of the river water rushing, there was also the sea breeze blowing from afar.</p>
<p>On the boat, I quickly fell asleep from exhaustion. The next day, when the gentle sun was smiling happily in the east, I was awakened by the noisy voices of a large group of travelers or sailors. I rubbed my eyes and ran to the deck to absorb the fresh morning sea breeze. At that time, when looking out with my eyes, I could see the reeds on both sides of the bank and the green forests on the plains, so charmingly dressed in the beautiful clothes of nature.</p>
<p>The boat passed through Bu Lan, and soon arrived at the prosperous Shi Qi. When the boat was still in the sea breeze, I could see the uneven wharves standing on the shore like rows of teeth, and various flags of different colors fluttering on the shore, beckoning. The uneven, old and new buildings followed the endless wharves, spreading far away. The desolate tower top on the high mountain in the city showed a terrible desolation and lonely sadness in the quiet morning. Among the city streets, there were occasionally large hotels standing tall, proudly flying the national flag - yes, they were the proud sons of heaven in the bustling markets of the countryside!</p>
<p>When the boat was docking at the not-so-clean wharf, before I even stepped ashore, many porters or rickshaw pullers blocked my way, shouting one sentence after another, unable to get out of the way:</p>
<p>"Hey! Sir! Go to ×× Hotel! It's half price there! Need a car?"</p>
<p>"Come, come! Here, I'll pull you there, I'll pull you there..."</p>
<p>The situation was really no different from that in big cities. From all aspects, one could see that there was deception and terrible evil hidden there. Those people with a cunning air gathered around me, like predators.</p>
<p>When wandering on the wide road, one could see from the crowded crowds everything that was no different from the big cities. The shop assistants were shouting with wide-open mouths at the entrances of the big shops, there were flags embroidered with flowers and advertising big discounts, there were bitter smiling faces, some showing extremely lively business, while others were so cold that even the shop assistants were dozing off. The gramophone melodies of the department stores were blasting so vigorously. The big hotels, as if afraid that people would not know how beautiful they were, were still displaying the touching patterns of business outside the threshold. Also, the fragrances exuding from the show windows of the large hotels, the fascinating music coming from the large theaters, the aloofness and solemnity of the large banks, all of these, coupled with the faces of the daughters of the metropolitan city covered with fragrant powder, the charming fashions, the graceful posture of high heels - all of these can represent the prosperity of Sun Yat-sen's hometown. The colors of progress have been constantly turning with the wheels of the times. Perhaps, this place can be considered a very outstanding market town! Even the "blind man's cake," "oyster sauce," and "seafood delicacies" produced here are quite famous.</p>
<p>The streets in the market towns of Guangdong are longitudinal, horizontal, or curved. When I ran until I was exhausted, I finally stepped onto the mountain peak and went to the Buddhist temple to absorb the fresh river breeze. At this time, one could even see the vigorous colors of a new town. The white buildings reflected against the white sky, and everywhere one could see black smoke rising from the black chimneys of small factories, spreading out into the sky in puffs.</p>
<p>Apart from some extravagant shadows, we can also see simple girls with healthy bodies walking on the streets - all of this makes people unable to forget that it (Shi Qi) is a new town with lush vitality, full of vivid and alluring shadows.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Sea Sickness <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>Before I even went to sea, I heard people say that people who are not healthy will get "seasick" when they go to sea. Seasickness, as the refined people say, is "sea sickness." That is to say, it is a disease that one gets only when one goes to sea. Once one leaves the sea, the disease will slowly get better without needing treatment. This disease originally has no borders; it is not as if foreigners will not get it. Moreover, the name of this sea sickness was even translated from foreigners. Sea sickness is originally a terrible and strange disease, but it only gives more opportunities to those who are not healthy: friends who are used to comfort suddenly come to this crazy sea, living the kind of unstable and upside-down life, of course they cannot get used to it. Therefore, they will have mental discomfort, leading to vomiting and dizziness. It is very reasonable. Because of this, even though my friends warned me in every way, I did not take it to heart, because I have never been someone who is used to living a comfortable life, and I have not lived at sea for a short time, although it is an inland river, but is it not the same? Therefore, although I am drifting on the sea alone this time, I am not afraid.</p>
<p>The ship slowly sailed out of the inland river and arrived on the coast of the boundless Pacific Ocean. Originally, the sea waves near the shore are much smaller than the sea waves when traversing the Pacific Ocean, but compared to the inland river, they are much bigger. Moreover, the time is also early autumn, the visible waves are not large, but the "ground swells" are very severe, that is, the reaction of the water. They are all rebelling inside the sea. Although there are no waves as high as the Himalayas throwing over on the surface, their silent reaction under the hull is even worse than the obvious waves. For the gentlemen who generally live in comfort and ease, this is undoubtedly a huge threat. Therefore, the sound of vomiting increases proportionally with the instability of the hull.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was out of schadenfreude, I took a great risk to walk from the steerage to those so-called cabins to see the ugliness of these civilized people. – “A wonder!” I saw many ladies like "little squirrels" and "little birds" lying their entire bodies on men, presenting a gray-white face like an anemic patient, their lips also white without a trace of blood, a long string of saliva hanging from their mouths, groaning like a dying patient. I was wondering in my heart, who would believe that the so-called charming "beauties" who enjoy themselves in the city, their faces painted red and white, are originally such a "skeleton."</p>
<p>I praised the sea, she is so fair, she is like an impartial judge, very different from the city that has changed its color after being influenced by money. Her rioting authority is a punishment for those who live in comfort. Therefore, I also thought that sea sickness has no boundaries. What it has first is a terrible test for people living in places without waves.</p>
<p>Thinking back to myself, it is good that I have not been troubled by this terrible test, because I am also a vagrant who lives an unstable life in the midst of waves. Being at sea or not being at sea is originally the same, living under terrible storms, with no difference. Therefore, although the sea is terrible, its raging waves are already a very common thing for us. Even so, I am still praising the sea, because its gift of raging waves can be considered a relatively fair one in the midst of unfairness.</p>
<p>However, there is no definite view of things in the world, especially in this kaleidoscope-like society. Or, in another person's view, such as that of gentlemen and ladies, perhaps their view of this kind of thing is exactly the opposite of ours. Not only do they not praise the sea, but they also curse "sea sickness" for its cruelty to them. Naturally, their or her opinions are all correct. In fact, what else can they feel about their own suffering other than that others or a third party are cruel! However, it cannot be said that my praise of the sea or my liking for "sea sickness" is wrong. Of course, I have my reasons, and my humble status in society can prove it.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Summer Evening (Part 1) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>Colorful clouds are dancing in the distant cooking smoke. The faint sound of a shepherd's flute is passing through the nearby fields. On the mud road over there, three or five shepherd boys are lying on the backs of old oxen, slowly returning to the village, while the farmers, having finished weeding the rice in the fields, are dragging their tired bodies and walking home.</p>
<p>Women's shouts, men's conversations, children's cries, and goats' bellows are rippling in the village in waves. The entire village is full of noisy sounds, and the air suddenly seems irritable.</p>
<p>Those women have just helped their husbands weed the fields and returned, but they still cannot have a moment's rest. They are busy nursing their children, feeding the goats grass, fixing dinner, preparing bathwater for the men, and bathing the children… They are truly so busy that they cannot breathe. However, those who do not farm and have no children have already eaten dinner, taken a bath, changed clothes, and sat in the open space in front of the door, fanning themselves with palm-leaf fans to enjoy the cool breeze. Sometimes, when they are happy, they will hum those old-fashioned mountain songs. They see them being so busy, but are unconsciously proud of their own leisure. However, for them, they only often resent their fate:</p>
<p>"I'm busy like a busy person all year round, but I still often have to worry about going hungry. Unlike other people's comfortable lives, they eat well and dress well every day. They don't have to go up the mountain to chop firewood, and they don't have to go down to the fields to pull weeds! Alas! It's like we were born with a poor fate..." Sometimes when they hear the noise of the children or the bleating of the goats in the pen, it will further cause them annoyance and impatience: "Damned goats, little ghosts, are you all going to die soon?"</p>
<p>My house is completely dark and I don't even light a lamp. The mosquitoes have set up a Yellow River formation inside and outside the door. Mosquito-repellent smoke, which smells extremely unpleasant, is burning on the ground, and the smoke covers the entire house. Their formation is also somewhat chaotic: they are buzzing and flying around in the air, making a sound like a scattered bee hive. Qi Bang A Gen is lying on the edge of the courtyard, but has become the target of the mosquitoes' attack. He is waving a cattail fan to drive them away while slapping them with his hands, but they are still constantly sneaking attacks on every part of his body, every piece of his flesh!</p>
<p>"Dead mosquitoes, plague mosquitoes, I'm tired and want to sleep, but you all have to come find me." He finally grumbled and got up, walked to the back door and sat down on the small stone bridge under the Nanni fan-shelf. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Mr. Bao Mingshan, editor and publisher of the Chinese Harmonica Circle, teaches the performance of world-famous songs on the Huamei Radio Station (frequency 1060) every Sunday morning from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM. It is heard that this Sunday (August 4th), Mr. Bao has invited Mr. Yu Yuxing, our country's only chromatic harmonica expert, to come to Huamei Radio Station to broadcast a special program on chromatic harmonica and short scale harmonica. (Please read tomorrow's column for detailed program). Mr. Yu is famous throughout the country and has many harmonica works published. He usually promotes the art of harmonica very hard, such as founding the joint harmonica team of various universities in Hangzhou, the Suzhou Da Wu Harmonica Association, etc. Mr. Yu does not usually perform lightly. This public broadcast is because of a deep friendship with Mr. Bao, which he could not refuse, so he exceptionally makes his first performance after coming to Shanghai. Readers of this newspaper are requested to pay attention to listening at that time, and don't miss this good opportunity.</p>

<p>Chinese children's education has not been popularized, and Chinese children's educational films are even more lacking. This can be said to be a huge loss for China and for all Chinese children.</p>
<p>Taking "Little Angel" as an educational film for children is most appropriate, but its more valuable aspect is that it has educational significance and is presented in an interesting, lively and vivid manner.</p>
<p>Using Wang Renmei, Lin Chuchu, Tang Tianxiu, and Li Junpan, these first-class actors, and using Wu Yonggang, a most promising director, to direct, can already prove the superiority of this drama. What is even more noteworthy is the new child star Ge Youye in this film. Xianhua specially invited him from Hong Kong to help make this drama a success. The new star Liu Qiong also</p>

<p>The male and female protagonists of "Water Country Spring and Autumn" are two major celebrities who are currently highly regarded (because the time has not yet arrived for the film's maturity, the names are temporarily not announced).</p>
<p>Wan Cangsu is wholeheartedly devoted to discovering new talents, so in "Water Country Spring and Autumn", in addition to the two male and female protagonists, Zhao Zhenni, Dai Yanwan, Liu Li, Chen Juanjuan and others are all new people.</p>
<p>Wan Cang has a naughty son who is ten years old this year, and is the little overlord of Luyang Village. He gathers a group of naughty children in the lane to play movie-making games, and he directs, shouting "Camera", "Cut" very loudly. Someone said: Like father, like son, this is certainly believable.</p>
<p>The colleagues of Zhonghua who are staying behind are relatively relaxed in their work, so in addition to playing table tennis for recreation, they have also been actively studying Peking opera tirelessly these days.</p>
<p>Miss Yan Qun from Beiping has now been hired as a Mandarin professor at the Zhonghua Company.</p>
<p>Miss Wei Fen, the daughter of Bu Wancang, who played the daughter of Li Minghui in the Yi Hua's "Woman" and was regarded as an extraordinary little angel, will also be "active" in "Water Country Spring and Autumn."</p>
<p>There are three special features of the script for "Water Country Spring and Autumn": (1) The subject matter is realistic and tragic, (2) The plot is stimulating and powerful, (3) The background is majestic and vast.</p>

<p>Hu Die in "Night Fragrance" is a flower-selling working woman. Whenever the lights come on, she carries her flower basket and appears at the entrances of some dance halls and bars. Because her will is weak and she cannot resist the temptation of vanity, she is soon seduced by Sun Min, a young master who often appears in places of wine, red lights and green lights, and becomes his plaything. After a long time, Sun Min gradually lost interest in Hu Die? At this time, she was pregnant, her boudoir was empty, and she sat up until dawn every night. In fact, at this time Sun Min had already found a new love. The blow of "unbearable memories" was already enough to hurt Hu Die, and Sun Min would abandon him even more. At this time, she didn't know where to go, and she had no face to see her old father and mother when she returned home, which made her understanding of life only deception and insult.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Working Diary of Dayu Island <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Today is our most memorable day, because our work on Dayu Island has begun today.</p>
<p>We got up at four o'clock in the morning, gathered and set off. The large team marched mightily towards Dayu Island.</p>
<p>Shidao is about seven or eight li away from Dayu Island. There are no vehicles to ride there, so everyone had to run hard on their two legs! Everyone was very excited, and the steps were neat and the discipline was strict.</p>
<p>It was really good weather when we got out of the door. We walked and walked to our destination! Dayu Island. We rested in a fisherman's home, then organized props, makeup... Everyone started working, and we observed everything about them in more detail, and conducted further research on their life and actions.</p>
<p>It is really a uniquely flavored fisherman's home. The fishy and humid air made our breathing blocked.</p>
<p>After Tian Fang put on makeup, he chatted with the fishermen, and the fishermen actually treated him as a companion and joked with him.</p>
<p>We left the fisherman's house and went to the beach, and the work was troublesome enough. Because of the tide, the boats could not go into the water, so Director Wang also helped to tow them. Only then could the boat go into the water.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu shook the large case very quickly, which surprised the boatmen. Strange! He would be able to shake it in a few minutes.</p>
<p>The position of the camera was placed on a rock, with raging waves in front and deep ditches behind. If you are not careful, there is a danger of both people and machines being destroyed. On a rock further behind, stood a crowd of men and women watching, their eyes staring straight at the mysterious camera!</p>
<p>At the beginning of filming, another problem arose: when the boat rowed into the lens, the boatmen refused to drop anchor and stop, saying that there were hidden reefs below. When Director Wang was forced to have no choice, he jumped into the bottom of the sea, which was ten feet deep, and floated up after lying dormant for six or seven minutes, proving that the bottom of the sea was sandy. The boatmen were then relieved to drop the anchor. It is said that the seabed is indeed full of hidden reefs, and in order to film the scene, they had to deceive them. Fu Baolu, Chen Tianguo, and Tian Fang drove piles in the deep water. After the filming was over, Director Wang still went into the water to retrieve the anchor.</p>
<p>After that, the entire crew boarded the boat from the beach again to shoot a few beautiful seascapes and returning fishing boats in the distance. The wind and waves were very strong, the small boat was very unfree to move, and it was not easy to stabilize the angle of the lens, but the photographer Shen Yongshi struggled with the sea with an indomitable spirit, and victory ultimately belonged to us.</p>
<p>Little sister Fang Li is very smart and learned the fishermen's folk songs just a few days after arriving at Shidao.</p>
<p>Miss Liu Liying also had the courage to go to sea. (Tianyi Communication)</p>
