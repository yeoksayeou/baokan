<p>主席林森致開會詞</p>
<p>（南京）五全大會開幕典禮、主席林森致開會詞、原詞如次、自從第四次代表大會以來、至今整整已有四年、經過好幾次因不得已原因的延期、直至今日纔舉行第五次全國代表大會、關於籌備和延期的經過、中央黨務報告中當另有說明、不待重述、我們歷次延期、固然因為有種種事實的原因、最主要的還在希望大會多得集思廣益的機會、使大家在大會中、格外能表現踴躍團結的精神、這次參加大會的代表、及中央委員人數、超過了歷屆的紀錄、因內部的團結情形、較之四次代表大會時更有增進、這一層全黨同志必定覺得很安慰的、我們開會的日期、正是總理的誕日、大家在參謁總理陵墓以後、來參加開幕典禮、人人心中必然感覺得有總理偉大的精神、照臨乎我們之上、全體同志追念總理的遺訓、體察國家當前情勢的艱危、人人心中又必然都感覺到有兩個問題、（一）我們對於總理遺留給我們的革命救國的使命、所已盡力者幾何、（二）我們對於今後努力奮鬥的途徑、又應該怎樣、這兩點正是代表大會的使命、卽所謂檢查過工工作、和決定將來方針、本黨負有建國的責任、在代表大會開會期間、全國同胞均屬目於我們大會的進行、我們大家應該如何以總理之精神為精神、發揮總理未竟的緒業、安慰全國同胞的期望、鼓舞起一致救國的熱誠、振衰起敝、以挽回艱危的國運、在過去四年的中間、國家所遭遇的國難、重疊相乘、難以盡述、四次代表大會舉行於國難發生之始、到今天國難的嚴重、更十倍於當時、因了外患的加深、加上了水旱天災匪禍、以及經濟變動的劇烈、使得舉國民衆備嘗屈辱流離和痛苦、在責備我們的、都是我們的工作不能和國家艱危緊迫的境相應和、在原諒我們的、則以為我們在這幾年中並不是沒有向上的努力、國家與人民並不是沒有相當的進步、祇是世界形勢的變遷、外來困難的加甚、證明革命救國的工作、正在經過一重極辛苦的試騐、不論是責備或是原諒、我們都覺得應自己鞭策、我們站在黨內的地位、實在是愧對總理、愧對我們革命的天職、站於本黨對國家的責任來說、實在也可以說是愧負一般的國民、為完成我們的使命、當然應有更深一層的自省和努力、大會對於過去的工作、在開會中間必有嚴切的檢查、來作成决議、但最重要的任務、尤其在開創今日以後努力途徑、使我們的黨與全體國民、提挈一致、以盡救國復興的責任、因此對於本黨的章制、以及黨務的推進、我們應考慮有沒有應改善的地方、研究如何切實改善的方法、使本黨能在革命救國的工作上、切實負起比一般國民還要吃重的責任、來實現總理的遺敎、對於今後政治上、對內對外的設施、以及一切建設、我們應悉心討論、確立精詳切當的方針、對於團結國民共門奮鬥、我們應該討論如何鼓起全國的熱誠、集中全國的心思才力、以共濟艱危的方案、我們相信到會代表同志、必然有很完美的議案、很精詳的討論、來作成切實有效的决議、以慰全黨全國的期望、我們覺得我們當前的工作、應重在將來、因為本黨是負有時代使命的黨、而時代是始終前進的、由今日來比較第四次代表大會時代的情勢、有一點顯著的變遷、足使我們感到興奮、這便是國民對於本黨的態度、在四次代表大會、當時一般國民對於國家的環境和前途、似乎還沒有十分深刻的認識、對於本黨祇是片面的責難、或不滿、甚至因對黨的不滿、而對總理救國的主張、及一切遺敎、也發生懷疑的、到了今天、則大多數知識分子、及有覺悟的國民、一改其片面的責備、而為加重責任的期望、在黨外的輿論、祇是責備我們沒有完全盡到、總理交給我們的使命、不斷鞭策本黨的努力自愛、願意在一個目的之下、與本黨共同盡瘁、來努力於國家的建設和復興、這一個顧然的變遷、一方面證明總理遺敎和主義的偉大、表示我們時代的進步、但同時也使我們身為黨員的全體同志、格外感覺得責任的重大、我們若不能一致的努力、切實負起救國的責任、將不僅為總理的罪人、因此更使我們想到第一次代表大會時、總理所諄諄告誡黨員的遺訓、總理當時曾說、我們國民黨要有一種精神結合、第一犧牲自由、第二要貢獻能力、並且還申說了必須個人能犧性自由、然後全黨纔能得自由、個人能貢獻能力、然後全黨纔能有能力、黨有了自由和能力、纔能擔負革命的大事業、來改造國家、總理說這一番話這在十餘年以前、但我們觀察這十幾年以來、許多新興國家由困苦危亡中奮鬥成功的途徑、實在不外犧牲自由、與貢獻能力兩句話、可惜總理這樣的精識遠見、我們過去沒有能完全奉行、其實要組織一個健全的革命救國的集團、固然必須全體黨員能犧牲自由、與貢獻能力、要造成一個獨立自由的國家、也不外乎使全體國民、人人都能為國家而犧牲自由、與貢獻能力、這個精確不磨的理論、眞是我們今後努力的大道、犧牲自由、就是能克己、貢獻能力、就是能效命、我們要以黨內犧牲自由的精神、來感動全國國民、都為國家來犧牲自由、我們又必須加倍刻苦、來貢獻能力、才可以團結、全國同胞人人貢獻能力、為國家效命、在這個安危興亡的關頭、我們重述總理這一番的還敎、更覺得有深長的意義、敎望全體同志、充分表現這兩句遺訓的精神、來盡我們應有的使命、敬祝大會成功、（十二日中央社電）</p>

<h3 id="c32">奉獻於五全大會 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>五全大會已於昨日開幕。各地出席代表。較歷屆為多。實為國民黨內部團結進步之徵象。按全國代表大會為國民黨之最高權方機關。對於黨章與政綱。皆有改變决定之權。同時又為產生五屆中央執行委員之唯一機關。故其使命之重大。亦遠過於尋常之中全會。亦唯如是。其對於黨國所負之責任尤重。我人於此。深願出席諸公。能認識其使命與責任。而慰國民喁喁之望。</p>
<p>今日之國民對於國民。黨之主義。原則上可謂皆已接受。且多深信其為建國之僅有途徑。所未能滿意者。卽國民黨雖有燦爛光明之主義與政綱。惜未能切實推行從早兌現耳。如節制資本平均地權。為國民黨民生主義之精粹所在。然七八年來。果有一事類乎此種政策者乎。訓政時期最重要之民衆訓練。為四權訓練。然訓政六年。亦未遑及乎此也。其他能坐而言不能起而行之煌煌大計。亦復不一而足。我人固知此種現象之發生。多為近年來內憂外患交相煎迫。人力財力兩皆缺乏之所。致然國民黨之未能盡其最善的努力。及一般黨員缺乏推行主義之熱誠。當不失為一大原因。此後如何救弊補偏。力圖挽救。此今日出席大會諸公所應注意而妥為籌謀者也。</p>
<p>國難之嚴軍。無過於今日。國民黨適當其衝。遂為論者非難之的。一時名流學者。且多主張從早結束訓政。早開黨禁。一若舍此而外。別無救國之道者然。顧平心而論。中國今日之國難。為近數十年來歷史陳陳相因之總彙。非國民黨所能單獨負責。縱使今日之國民黨立刻交出政權。我人敢斷言中國之國難。不獨未必减輕。或且有加甚之可能。何則。今日之國難。多半由於我國未具現代國家之條件。國民黨具有數十年之歷史。黨員數十萬。其主義政策。又皆為建立現代國家必不可少之大經大法。以如是之黨。握有全國之政權。而尙不能有為。反謂以此政權交與其他臨時集合之三數渺小政團。卽能使國家起死回生。苟非愚味。孰能信之。故眞能明白事理者。當不以國難之嚴重歸責於國民黨。唯國民黨為副國民儲託之重起見。當使其種種支票早日兌現耳。</p>

<h3 id="c53">日月星辰怎樣運行　及運行結果所發生之現象（五） <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— （十月十八二十一二十七二十八日對全國民衆講）　中央研究院天文研究所研究員　陳遵媯</p>
<p>我現在巳經查過從公元一五四二年（明嘉靖二十一年）到本年，差不多是四百年裏頭，一共有過二十六次日食經過中國。從今年以後一百年裏頭一共有十次日全食可見於中國可算是很多的一個世紀。可是這等日食或者太近早晨，或者太近日落，或者太偏於南北邊境。求其地位恰好能在中午見食者，在過去四百年內祇有四次，在未來一百年裏頭，祇有一次，這和上面所約算的機遇，大約相符。如果還要求其經過黃河長江一帶人口稠密區域，而且在本部的中區近中午而見食，則五百年裏頭，祇有兩次。其一是一五四二年八月十一日（明嘉靖二十一年七月已酉，明史紀之）的全食，中午日食在黃河流域。其二是一九四一年（民國三十年）九月二十一日的全食，中午日食在長江流域，這兩次全食差不多相距整整四個世紀。這樣的機會，眞眞可以算是難逢可貴的，所以我國天文學家，物理學家，氣象學家，現在巳經組織一個日食覜測委員會，準備那時候的觀測事宜。</p>
<p>我們中國最近可見的日全食，本來還有明年六月十九日和民國三十二年（公元一九四三年）二月五日兩次，不過這兩次的路綫，都是很偏於東北的邊境，機會不算很好，還有民國三十七年（公元一九四八年）五月九日一次雖然從西南到東北，可是多半可見的是環食，就使能够看見一點全食，時間也是非常的急促。</p>
<p>以上所說的是日月運行結果所發生日月食的情形，現在我們要講四季的變化了。</p>
<p>什麽叫做四季？我們都知道就是春夏秋冬。我們並且知道夏天是非常的熱，冬天是非常的冷，春秋兩季是溫暖合宜的。所以大家都知道春夏秋冬是和氣候溫度有聯帶的關係。但是春夏秋冬是這樣的發生？各季溫度何以有變化？那就是和太陽位置有關係，換一句話說，就是地球繞着太陽運行的原故。</p>
<p>我們都知道地球是一個扁球的形狀，他每天自轉一周。他的自轉方法是以通過他的中心一條綫為軸而旋轉的，譬如我們拿一個木球，另外用一桿木棒挿過木球的中心，我們用兩個手拿着木棒的兩頭而旋轉，則木球也隨着而旋轉。地球的自轉，乙是和這個樣式一樣，通過地心這條綫呌做自轉軸，自轉軸的兩端，呌做直交，這個平面和地球表面相交成為一個犬圓，這個大圓周呌做地球的赤道。所以我們把地球表面上和兩極相等距離的地點，連結起來，翼是地球的赤道。譬如上面所說的木球，代表我們的地球，我們用鉛筆把球面上頭和棒的兩端相等距離的點，都連結起來，那一定是一個大圓周，這個圓周，就是赤道。</p>
<p>我們站在院子外頭，看見天空，好像是一個半圓球的樣子。一切日月星長好象都在這半圓球上面，實際上這天空是以我們所站在的地方為中心，以無限大的長為半徑的一個大球形，我們雖然只看見他的一半，另外一半是在我們的地平綫以下。這樣大的球，天文學上呌做天球一切日月星辰的運行，都想像在這個天球的上面，我們假設把地球赤道面向外面延長，一定和天球相交於一個大圓呌做天球的赤道。我們把地球自轉軸的兩端向外邊延長，一定相交天球於兩點，在北邊的呌做天球的北極，南邊的呌做天球的南極。這個天球的北極附近有一個星，我們呌做北極星。我們於晴天的晚上向北面而立，先找到北斗七星的所在。看見了北斗七星，然後把斗的外側兩個星向斗口方向引長過去，到這兩個星的距離的五倍光景，有一個亮的星，這就是北極星。天的北極，就在這個星的附近，也就是我們地球自轉軸所指的方向。</p>
<p>我們已經知道地球是環繞太陽周圍而運行的，但是我們從地球上面看過去，好像是太陽在空中運行的機子，我們地球實際環繞太陽一周所需要的時間是呌做一年，他所行的軌道投射在天球上面的呌做黃道，所以黃道就是太陽一年在天球上所行的軌道。這個黃道和赤道不是一致的，他們兩個相交的角度是二十三半，因為這兩個大圓——赤道是一個大圓，黃道也是一個大圓——不是一致的原故，所以相交於兩點，這兩點呌做分點，就是春分點和秋分點。</p>
<p>黃道和赤道旣然不在一個平面上頭，所以黃道被赤道分做兩部分，一部分在赤道的北面，一部分在赤道的南面，我們知道太陽是在黃道上面走的，所以每年裏頭太陽是出入於赤道的南北，就是從赤道的北邊向赤道的南面而行，然後再從南面向赤道北面而行，一年一周。所以每年裏頭太陽在赤道上面的日期有兩次，就是通過兩分點的日期，一次是每年三月二十一日左右太陽從南半球移到北半球所經道的點這點呌做春分點，這時候呌做春分，一次是在每年九月二十三日左右，太陽從北半球移到南半球所經過的點這點呌做秋分點，這時候呌做秋分。又黃道上在赤道南邊最低的點，呌做冬至點，太陽在這點上的時候呌做冬至，黃道上在赤道北邊最高的點，呌做夏至點，太陽在這點的時候，呌做夏至。</p>
<p>至於太陽出沒的方向，也在四季而不一樣，就中國地方來說，當春分和秋分的時候，太陽從正東出來，而由正西下去，太陽一天所行的道路，一半在地平綫上面，一半在地平綫下面，所以晝夜平均，就是白天和夜晚是一樣的長短。到夏至時候，太陽在極北地方，從東北方向出來，而沒於西北，太陽在地平綫上所行的道路比半圓大，所以白天最長，晚上最短。冬至時候，太陽在極南地方，從東南方向上來，向西南方向下去，太陽在地平綫上面所行的道路比半圓小，所以白天最短，夜間最長。</p>
<p>太陽從今年三月二十一日左右，經過春分點以後，循着黃道向東運行到明年三月二十一日左右再通過春分點的時候是為一年，在這一年裏頭，太陽是在黃道上行了一周，共三百六十度；上面所說的春分夏至秋分冬至四點，正好彼此相距是九十度，再把九十度分為六個等分就行十五度為一節，一共得了二十四節氣，他的次序，從春分說起，是春分，淸明，殺雨，立夏，小滿，芒種，夏至，小暑，大暑，立秋，廳暑，白露，秋分，寒露，霜降，立冬，小雪，大雪，冬至，小寒，大塞立春，雨水，警蟄，這二十四節氣的來源，按上面所說的節氣，是完全根據太陽的位置，所以大家多以為節氣是奮歷的好處，實在可笑的很，關於這個問題，等到下次講到「國歷的好處」的時候再說。至於四季的分法，有的是按節氣來分的，有的是按氣象來分的，他的令法可以分做三種</p>
<p>第一，我們中國歷來的分法，就是</p>
<p>春：以春分為中心，即從立春（二月四日左右）到立夏（五月五六日左右）凡九十日十八小時。</p>
<p>夏：以夏至為中心，即從立夏到立秋（八月七，八日左右）凡九十四日一小時。</p>
<p>秋：以秋分為中心，即從立秋到立冬（十一月七日左右）凡九十一日二十小時。</p>
<p>冬：以冬至為中心，即從立冬到立春，凡八十八日十五小時。</p>
<p>就是我們中國是以四個立字為四季的起頭，就是立春是春的起頭，立夏是夏的起頭，我們中國的舊歷規定正二三月是春季。但是以月亮的朔望，規定每月的日數，根據太陽的位置，規定月數，所以正月元旦，未必就是立春，立春常在正月元旦前後十四日半左右，所以立春有的時候在前年的年底，但是長久期間的平均，大概是正月九日左右。</p>
<p>第二，西洋各國的分法，就是</p>
<p>春：從春分（三月二十一，二日左右）到夏至（六月二十二，三日左右）凡九十二日二十小時。</p>
<p>夏；從夏至到秋分（九月二十二，三日左右），凡九十三日十四小時。</p>
<p>秋：從秋分到冬至（十二月二十一，二日左右），凡八十九日十九小時。</p>
<p>冬：從冬至到春分，凡八十九日一小時。以上的分法，普通呌做天文學家的分法，他是從三月下旬畫夜平分日期起到白天最長的日期止呌做春。從春末起，到九月畫夜平分的日期止呌做更，從夏末起到白天嚴短的日期止呌做秋，從秋末起到明年畫夜平分的日止，呌做冬</p>
<p>第三氣象果的分法。就是</p>
<p>春：三，四，五，三個月，共九十二日</p>
<p>夏：六，七，八，三個月，共九十二日</p>
<p>秋：九，十，十一，三個月共九十一日</p>
<p>冬：，十二，一，二，三個月，共九十日或九十一日</p>

<p>— 紀元</p>
<p>重慶之形形色色（上）</p>
<p>重慶位置介於揚子江與嘉凌江二水之間、全城成半島形、房屋依山構築、高低不一、以地勢言、頗似美國的落杉磯、我國南部的香港、但前以街道的狹窄、街上秩序的凌亂而言、則殊多愧色、據最近的統計、全市人口約有三十餘萬、連江北巴縣在內、約有八十餘萬、為四川第一大商埠、亦為我國西北及西南兩方面的屏藩、川省出入口貿易、除下川東有一部份貨物由萬縣集散外、其餘均須以重慶為轉運的樞紐、卽雲南貴州西康陝西甘肅等省進出口的貨物、亦多由此地轉運、</p>
<p>因地勢之衝寧、所以在前清光緒十六年、翼為英國所垂涎、於中英北京續約中、將重慶闢為商埠、迄今領事巷內、各國領署林立、大門半掩、入其內則庭草幽閒、使人倍增「長江門戶洞開」之感、民元以來、四川省內大小四白七十餘次之內戰、亦幾無不以成渝兩地為爭奪的中心、重慶地位之重要、實不亞於成都、</p>
<p>自今春中央軍入川以後、重慶地位愈形重要、交通建設、旣以重慶為樞紐、而四川經濟的開發、亦將以重慶為發動中心、最近行營遷至重慶、武昌行營亦與重慶行營合併、於是重慶更成為全國軍事指揮的中心、記者此次在渝、先後逗留旬日、見開所及、覺渝市之種種情形、與下游各埠、頗有不同之點、略述所感如次、一、銀行發達錢號倒閉重慶在前淸末年、已有銀行的設立、及至民十九年以後、銀行業務更日益發展、中間雖因川省財政的混亂、與金融幣制的複雜、於銀行業務的准展、不無妨害、但銀行在此百孔千瘡的狀態中、仍呈日漸滋榮之象、此中最大原因、約有二點（一）農村不斷崩潰、官僚商人資本、集中於銀行、（二）經營申匯投機及公債買賣與利率洋水等業務、銀行較錢號為便利、職是之由、去年渝市銀行、除有二三家因狂賭空頭申匯而折本外、其餘均獲厚利、現渝市有大小銀行十餘家、各銀行在渝分設之支行、聞尙不在內、至於錢號、則受銀行幫的壓迫、營業不振、倒閉頗多、數目已由五六十家减至一二十家、近尙有繼續倒閉者、自中央以八折收回地鈔命令公佈後、重慶金融界曾掀起小波浪、幣制基礎、迄今尙未完全安定、商業來往收支多採用劃條或劃賬、近來因中央鈔供不應求、劃條兌換中央鈔須貼水百分之二十、因之渝市金融界又起風波、但於銀行業務似尙不致有多大妨害、最近渝市美豐銀行擴展業務、新業銀行（原係鴉片業銀行）又有復活消息、因受滬市銀行投資農村的影饗、各銀行眼光似多集注於四川農村、因之各縣新設立之農民銀行、為數頗多、</p>
<p>二、商業外觀尙稱繁榮重慶商業、就大體分折、約有綢緞·布疋·山貨·藥材·鹽糖·蘇貨·五金·棉紗·米糧·桐油·烟業·航業等項、在過去一年中、本地出產之鹽糖、因受外貨侵銷、與捐稅之東縛、營業頗形不振、其他谷業、或以申匯關係、或以交易興旺、不無有利可圖、今年惰形、大致仍如往年、各項進口貨物、擁擠不堪、上水輪船水脚費、因高漲、反之出口貨物、以銷塲狹隘、數量日漸减少、惟桐油出口尙佳、據中國銀行經理周君、談「進口貨中以石油一項為大宗、年在八千箱左右、總計每年全省入超約在二千萬元以上、出口旣無法補救、而進口則源源而來、長此以往、其情形甚足憂慮」、言下深致感嘅、據記者調查所得、重慶市面、洋貨充斥、尤以日貨為多、而各洋貨店之生意、近來似乎特別發達、重慶一般豪富子弟、喜時髦、好摹仿、專為外商任消費工作、以故都市愈發展、而外商之勢力愈增加、交通工具之便利、適造成一推銷外貨的良好機會、頗堪痛心、周君繼談、「目前四川救急之法、雖不能積極開源、亦應儘量節流、如石油一項、四川到處皆有、水泥石膏銅鐵等等、四川亦右產額、毛織品之原料、四川西部及西北部出產甚多、如原料能充分利用、則外流可以抑制、百業可以發達、現四川的最大苦痛、為有原料而無生產工具、如何發展生產、實為當務之急、</p>
<p>三、中飽階級頗為專橫中飽階級卽所謂中間人、專恃獵取一航苦力的佣錢以為生、重慶市內此種人頗佔相當勢力、其對一般勞工的剝削、可謂無微不至、如輪船上之輪伕、人力車中佣錢、以及木船、卽小帆船四川人稱為木船）轎子骨竿（搆造較簡單之轎子）碼頭人力夫等組織中（均有中間人從中操縱、一般工人不經中間人之手、每不易找到職業、而一般中間人每招致多數失業農民、投奔都市、以便進一層從中剝削、以一般勞工生活、苦不堪言、卽以人力車一項而論、在共匪未竄以前、每日車租約十三吊（每吊約合銀元四分餘、外加佣錢、車夫每天辛苦所得、除付租而外、所餘無幾、竟有全部所得不够付車租者、後因共禍滋長、市政當局乃將車租由十三吊减至五吊、聞重慶市府方面、近亦注意及此、對此種榨取勞工惡習將嚴加限制、果能澈底辦理、勞動界受益不淺、</p>

<p>一，詩人眼里的農民</p>

<p>「怎樣了——</p>
<p>我們新釀的酒？」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>——劉半農一個小農家的暮——</p>
<p>在詩人的眼里，農村是多麽綺麗多麽令人神往的一幅圖畫！同樣地郁達夫先生暢遊浙省名勝的時候，也曾有過一首描寫山村景色的小詩，原詩我已不大記得，彷彿後二句是「雙雙兒女採茶去，閑煞鬥前一樹花！」在詩人的筆下，寂寞荒凉的農村變成「匕皂不驚」的太平世界了，</p>
<p>但，我們正不必向所謂田園派詩人的集子里去找材料，我們得從農民的現實生活去觀察去找問題。原來所謂一詩人」之流，是慣會以自己的悲歡哀樂去照觀」切的。下面，將我在鄕下二年來所見到的農民生活略談一二。</p>
<p>二，我看到的農民</p>
<p>在這里，我可以告訴讀者農村裏的幾件事實：</p>
<p>有一回，我們辦的簡易診療處來了一個五十多歲的農婦，為了她的兒子患瘧疾已有二年，想來求治。她問明了須吃金雞納霜之後，便要了一包：照例是要向她收六個銅子的——因為本地患癮疾的很多，要化十多塊錢一月才能應付，不能不收費——她在胸前挖了半天，出於意外的挖出來的竟是一枚鷄蛋。原來她家里可以作為交換品的就是這僅有的一枚雞蛋！而昨天生的一枚已經向雜貨店里換取洋油了！</p>
<p>記得我在家時，買稻草總是一担兩擔買的，市上也從沒有見過農民會提着一綑稻草來求售，可是，一天竟有一個農民提着一綑稻草來賣了，問他為甚麼只帶出一綑來呢？他的回答眞出於我的意外。『今天×村拜老爺，只要幾個銅子買香燭就够了。」原來鄕下是不大需要貨幣的。他們吃的麵粉，只是用小麥去換來—一升換一升，很是公平。</p>
<p>從城里回來，走過某一個村巷的時候，常會看到三三兩兩的農民圍着一張小方凳用膳。我有點近視病，最初也沒有留心到他們吃的是甚麼。想來大概不外豆腐鹹菜，鹹魚，白飯之類，總不會得新鮮魚肉吧。可是有一回我忽發奇想，在他們吃飯時，我走近去一看，這可把我怔住了：我雖不會把麥子當作韮菜，可是他們吃的東西我實在從未見過，當然不是飯，也不是粥，像米粉，又像漿糊。飯菜就是一盌用鹽水燒的羅漢豆。據說因為鹽貴，醃菜是不大有得吃。</p>
<p>夏天，一個龍鍾的老人，帶一個十四五歲的孩子來看病。老人坐下來還在那里喘氣，孩子忽然昏厥了！倉猝間急急用阿母尼亞給他嗅了，才慢慢的蘇醒過來。一問，知道他今天一起身就幫他父親挑一擔菜到村上來賣。肚子餓了，想買二個銅子山芋，沒有錢身體本是有病，空腹走了五六里路，還擔着菜，自然要支持不住了！</p>
<p>普遍的貧窮，普遍的在死亡綫上掙扎！然而這些還不過是旁觀者眼中的表象，終不免還是皮相。要知道他們—農民—實際上究竟過着怎樣的生活，最好還是聽他們自己的訴苦。三，農民自己的說話</p>
<p>他們本是「種田吃飯」的，可是現在已經普遍地感覺到「種田無好處，不種沒飯吃」了！</p>
<p>他們最怕是荒年，這裏有一位民校高級班畢業生曾寫這樣一首詩：</p>
<p>「年成荒，沒飯吃！</p>
<p>賣老牛，換米粒。</p>
<p>轉眼揷秧要翻泥，</p>
<p>沒有老牛只剩犁！』</p>
<p>寫這首歌的是一個勤苦的靑年農民，他今年還只有二十歲左右。我相信他下筆的時候，一定還忍着滿眶熱淚！</p>
<p>但是，還有比荒年更慘的事呢！去年的旱災，很多農田都是顆粒無收。免糧的荒田畝數是由政府核定的，可是農民享受不到免糧的權利，鄕下有句俗話呌做「荒年熟區書」，原來一到有災荒，總有免糧的田畝，一般徵收田賦的下級胥吏，便可以熟報荒，以荒報熟的從中舞弊。種自田的出錢買到一荒單」，可以免糧，種租田的買得荒單，可以免租；誰來管你田裏有沒有收成呢！下邊是合作社社員俞鴻山的日記的一頁：「今天早晨，我遇見一個憂容滿面的人，在田橫頭發呆。我問他，他說：「我家有八口，種田五畝，不幸今年旱災蟲傷，籽粒無收！現在不但衣食無着，連做荒費也無辦法，沒有荒單，便要還租米，看來只有一條死路了！」我說：「最近××鄉公所門口，貼着通告，所有全荒田畝，可以免糧，做荒公人，不准收取分文：現在為什麼又要收錢呢？」「呀，不要說一張告示，就是貼一百張也是無用的……他們都是一窠裏人。起初是糧書區書出頭收取，每畝荒田收取四角，才給荒單。後來圖正看看眼紅，就對大家說：糧書區書私造荒單，完全無效，必須鄉公所裏發的，方為有效，以後便歸鄕公所收取。不過×先生說鄕公所裏收取荒費，太不好聽。所以又遷至××里收。區書獨得五十元，其餘的便五股均派：糧書，南圖正，北圖正，救息會，鄕副各得一股。但是，荒的荒得眞苦，那裏還有錢來領荒單呢？」</p>
<p>我聽了不覺得也在田橫頭發呆了。</p>
<p>「如果沒有災荒怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>收成好，收成好！</p>
<p>今年要比去年多收幾担稻。</p>
<p>媽媽哈哈笑，妹妹雙脚跳；</p>
<p>『今年要搭我做件新棉襖。』</p>
<p>『好，好，好！』一陣笑！</p>
<p>收成好，收成好！</p>
<p>稻價眞眞糟，沒有去年高；</p>
<p>陳租還不了，那敢誤棉襖？</p>
<p>冬天到，冬天到！小妹妹凍得呌。」</p>
<p>周伸靑（民校高級班畢業生）</p>
<p>現在江浙等省不正在嚴追舊欠田賦嗎？田賦是國庫主要的收入，人民有納稅的義務：遇災荒可以從寬豁免，有舊欠當然也要「從嚴追回」可是我們要問，究竟是誰欠了田賦？回答得乾脆一點，所有赤足下田的自耕農或是半自耕農，統沒有欠過政府半個銅子兒！相反地，他每年支付的已超過了他們應完的串票一倍以上！農民直接到糧櫃上去完糧是不收的，他們只有讓「圖正」土劣等來替他們代完，而從中敲詐，我們且看民校學生金勻的日記：</p>
<p>「微風帶來了咯咯的咳嗽聲，原來×伯也來樹下休息了，他繼續說：「前天是完上年錢糧的末期，我預先把新娘子房裏的當頭當了五塊多錢，特為趕到城裏去完，那曉得櫃上先生一查，說是早已完過了。我一聽這話，曉得包完錢糧的圖正，已看中了我，悔氣錢一定不能逃了！就餓了肚子，匆匆趕到鄕下，在西街茶館裏尋到×圖正。我帶着笑說：多承您先生代我完了錢糧，請算一算幾塊錢？他慢慢地，拿出串票一看說。。照串完了十一塊，貼我盤費一元，共十二塊。哦！老侄！我應該只完五塊四五角錢，他要我十二塊…五塊多錢，還是在新娘子眼淚中奪出來的當頭…裏還有這外加六七塊錢呢？…後來我向他說了許多懇情話，還是沒用，昨天向××借了月利五分頭的七塊錢給他，才算了事！……」講到道裏，他老人家頭也垂下了，聲也哽住了！我也不忍再聽下去，就勸着他別哭，一同再去挑河泥。我想，吃了農民每畝五升米糧的圖正，總應當體恤我們窮苦人了。那知道他聯絡鄕長，無惡不作，連在完糧國課上也要大敲竹槓。這樣的貪得無厭，我們就是流盡了汗，滴盡了血，終年像牛馬一樣工作着，也是供養不起他們啊…！』</p>
<p>水災，旱災，土劣，警吏所交織成的一天羅地網」，把農民束縛得不能動彈了。他們終年的辛苦工作，還不能求得一飽。可是不種田，又待怎樣呢？無怪他們要作不平之鳴了：</p>
<p>「農夫忙，農夫忙，</p>
<p>農夫眞正忙！</p>
<p>穀子老，要收稻；</p>
<p>稻上塲，要種麥；</p>
<p>種好麥，要磨礱；</p>
<p>磨好礱，白米送給富人用！</p>
<p>一年忙到頭，</p>
<p>餓了肚皮挨了凍！』</p>
<p>—華逸民（民校高級班畢業生）—</p>
<p>把農村描寫做人閒的仙境，當然是詩人的幻覺；我們混入農民隊裏去，或則可以認識他們生活的一部份；但總不如請他們目己告訴我們來得真實而親切！有句俗話。「晨夫不種田，城隍斷火烟，農夫不讀書，有苦無處訴。」怎樣使農夫呌喊出自己的痛苦呢？</p>
<p>二四，一〇，一五，在無錫，埄鄕寫。</p>

<h3 id="c56">滬各界昨日舉行　總理誕辰紀念大會 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>

<p>報吿書補充附伴提出討論　最後大多數通過專家主張</p>
<p>工部局電話專家委員會電話報吿書、經工部局公用委員會兩次召集會議、詳細討論、反覆研詰、結果該報告書以大多數贊同、通過於公用委員會、前日工部局董事會舉行特別會議時、復已將公用委員會會議紀錄接受、並根據公用委員會之建議、將專家報吿書通過、詳情已誌昨報、查公用委員會上月二十八日第一次會議紀錄、前此已公佈於中外各報、茲複將本月七日第二次會議討論詳情、擇其要者披露如下、</p>
<p>是日公用委員會首先提出討論者、即各專家於總報告後所補充之附帶書、某委當即提出質問、謂據專家所補充之意見、徜按具收費辦法仍予維持、商用電話月費應增為十五元五角、查電話公司原有要求僅為十五元零六分、何以專家所擬訂者、反較公司所要求者為高、專家勃郞氏當即答稱、目前狀况、巳有實質上之變更、因在本年之內、話機數目减少、將達數千具之譜、此項損失、應自明年一月一日起、加入計算之中、再則本年投次之支出旣巳增加、開年折舊之提存、自亦必較目前為鉅也、某委復問前此公司方面、豈目光短缺、見不及此、勃郞氏稱、公司原冀話機有四千具之增加、今則非但無此增加、反有四千具之减少、前後相差、公司收益上之損失、達八千具之鉅、另一委員復問、何以商用電話須較住宅電話增加者多、勃郎氏答、現在住宅電話所付之話費、久巳超越其所應付者、此後倘再增加過多、該項電話前途之發達、恐受影響、主席於此指明、按勃郎氏所言、公司損失話機八千具、如以每具月租十五元而言、即為每月損失十二萬元、每年損失一百四十四萬元、勃郞氏又稱、電話公司所付與法租界工部局及公共租界工部局之年稅百分之二、在本年內、僅付其一部份、即自八月至年終為止、惟自翌年始、即須按照全年撥付、某委謂、公司在請求加價之特、當巳早知此點、故此次話機之减少、是否由於按具收費辦法所使然、勃郞氏答、按具收費辦法、當然為話機减少原因之一、即如報吿書後所補充者、亦謂、吾等深信此種按具收費辦法、此後若繼續行之、話機之數目、亦必日益减少、據吾久所知、現有許多較小用戶、預計將來按次收費辦法、勢必實行、故尙未取消其電話、倘將來按具制仍予維持、則此後用戶之减少、勢必益劇也、至此項因預料將來按次收費制之必實行、因而尙未取消其電話較小用戶之確實數目、據勃郞所言、則頗難加以統計、惟以約略言之、本年內話機之損失、其由於按具收費之辦法者、總在過半以上、蓋本年話機之减少、巳達三千四百具、而停止電話者、大半屬於小用戶也、因此知按具收費辦法、在昔時為適當者、現因租界範圍擴大、環境巳變吏矣、</p>
<p>某委當即起稱、據報吿書中所載、在一九三一年話機增加二千九百九十六具、即一九三〇年話機總數百分之八、一九三二年復增加六千一百七十七具、即一九三一年總數百分之十六、一九三三年又增加四千七百九十六具、即一九三二年總數百分之十一、而一九三四年又復增加五千四百六十具、即一九三三年總數百分之十一、凡此諸年份、均屬沿用按具收費辦法之時、但話機之數目、確未因按具收費辦法之不良而見减縮、故目前話機之减少、不如謂為因於經濟衰敝使然之為近理也，主席於此稱、即此以上所言確屬有理、供應最初費用之應低减、實益覺其迫切也、專家雷氏則稱、前數年話機增加之猛進、實有二大原因、一則因於電話事業之發展、久已在遏止潛伏之中、一則因新公司成立之後、機件改為自動、話務遂現蓬勃之勢、但該項發展、在按具收費制下、决無繼續滋畏之可能、惟改行新制後電話事業之重見起色、則可毫無疑義、復據勃郞氏所言、現有話機之總數、約為四萬八千具、惟以公司設備之範圍觀之、此數殊不足謂為經濟也、各委中有問何者始為合乎經濟之數目者、勃郞氏答、在電話事業之中、彼等實未嘗達到鮑滿之點、但倘使在上海已達到此點、而不需再添加新設備、亦不須增設新站、則在每一萬綫之新綫　上、　高度時、可供給九千話機之用、但在按具收費制下、因通話額非常龐大之戰、在中央接綫所原有一萬綫之設備、但僅可供六千具話機之用、倘公司全部機件之能力、能應用至八九成之程度、以至再無發展之餘地時、彼等然後可言巳達到一至經濟至圓滿之地步、外間有謂公司閒空機件數目過多者、但倘閒空機件、係百分之四十、即謂為百分四十之浪費、誠屬錯誤、世界各大電話事業、對於閒空機件之地位、無不時時在審核調查之中、以上海言之、形勢之變易、亦應加以老慮、即如中央區域之居民、向郊外區遷移、地下設備遂不得不隨之而增加、此俱屬專家時時考慮之事項也、</p>
<p>各委中復有請專家將上海電話供應、與倫敦紐約電話事業作一比較者、勃郞氏稱、據彼所知所聞、本埠所有之供應、較之世界各地所有者、毫無遜色之處、惟本埠空氣濕份過重、而小街之中、居民復有將雜物掛於電綫之上、公司無從禁止、因此造成之阻礙、恐亦不在少數云、電氏亦謂、據彼應用電話之經騐、及調查公司紀錄之所得、上海所有之電話、確乎可與美國紐約·詩家谷·或他處所有者、等量齊觀、稻田氏稱、日本東京之電話、亦時受潮氣之侵襲、但猶不及上海之甚、其他各種阻礙、上海所有者、日本亦有之、以大致而論、上海電話之供應、實不亞於日本所有者云云、</p>
<p>某委問、美國在三四十年以前、各城俱用按具收費之辦法、嗣後即易為按次收費制、惟行之不久、又復有退用按具收費辦法者、其故何在、雷氏答、自一八九五年至一九〇〇年之間、電話事業中、即有自按具改為按次之趨勢、此即各大城普遍之趨勢、所云旣改按次收費辦法、而又返為按具收費辦法者、彼實未之前聞、惟在紐約及波士頓二地之某種區域內、用戶曾有按具付費者、但其通話祗限於隣近極少數用戶之內、若與此少數用戶以外之用戶通話、仍須每次付五分一角或二角之話費、此在紐約·波土頓·及斐拉德爾斐亞·三地、彼知確曾一度行之、惟在詩家谷、則自始即行按次收費辦法、而在上述所謂區域內通話者、復有「帶內」及「市內」等通話費之名目云、</p>
<p>勃郞氏於此復指示、各專家在報吿書中已言之、按具收費辦法、祇可行之於用戶範圍不超越一個接綫機關之時、若在倫敦、通話百分之九十以上、俱須經連接之手續、若一切用戶悉在一接綫機關範圍之內、則站與站間綫纜之費用即可减省、若接綫站增加、費用遂不得不以倍計矣、各委中有詢及倫敦何時始行按次收費制者、勃郞氏答、當英國郵政局接辦電話事業之時、曾特許一部分甩戶、沿用按具收費辦法、惟至一九二一年、當局即對於該辦法感覺厭倦、遂通知舊用戶、宣告按具收費辦法一律中止、而按次收費制、即於是年普遍施行、且倫敦所行者、係屬完全按次收費辦法、並無第一階段免費通話次數包含在內云、勃郞氏復謂、在按次收費制尙未一律施用之前、倫教及其他各地平均通話次數、為每日七次半、在按次辦法施行之後、通話次數、即降為每日五次有餘、其减額為百分之二十五、惟在日本東京、自按次收費辦法施行之後、通話額即有百分之五十之减縮、蓋原有通話額愈高、將來减縮程度亦益鉅也、若以上海而論、將來改用按次辦法之後、减縮之程度、將超過倫教之數、但恐不至如日本東京之鉅、蓋在英國自一八七九年至一九二二年之中、所行者雖為按具收費辦法、但用戶祗限於少數享有特權之老用戶、再則在英國尙行按具收費辦法之時、商用電話之平均租費、約為每年十鎊、自郵政接辦之後、利物浦商用電話、每月租費為十二先令、通話一次、收費一辨士、彼曾於研究上海情形之後、與堪比擬也、惟英國每通話一次、收費一辨士、較之現在擬議之大洋三分、則在一倍左右云、</p>
<p>此次專家調查研究及革具報吿書之時間、計共二閱月之久、委員中有詢及此時間是否充分者、勃郞氏稱、此事全視彼等所須為之工作若何、若公司所有一切機件、須一一與以估價、則所需之時間必極長、此次草擬報吿書時、其中一切財政報吿數目等、確係由電話公司供給、而由各專家加以審定奢、在此點上、須知各專家、在機件費用上、各有其獨到之經騐、勃郎氏繼復陳述話機費用計算之方法、及各地費用比較之手續者甚詳、</p>
<p>某委復詢及報吿書中對於商用家用電話價目旣巳擬定、最近匯率之變更、於話價上是否有多少之影響、勃郞氏答稱、彼等不能因匯率之漲落、而變更其建議、彼覺內部之費用、不致有甚大之增加云、某委復謂、公司一部份之費用、當然與匯率有關、如以金元計算之人員薪資等、勃郞氏稱、據彼所知、僅有一人之薪金、係以金元計算者云、工部局財務處處長亦稱、專家之工作、不能顧及匯兌等問題、另一委復稱、據報吿書中所言、倘按具收費辦法不變更、公司方面、因通話額繼續增高之故、將不得不增加資金上之支出、約三百萬元之譜、匯率之漲落、當然於公司之支出上不無相當之關係云、勃郞氏稱、彼對於匯兌問題、未能加以注意、亦未加以研究、某委當即謂在此點上、可見按具收費辦法、倘繼續行之、前途危險實益鉅云、</p>
<p>另一委員復論及公司地產·房屋·機件·等等之估計、並詢問各專家是否曾加以深切之考察、抑僅以公司賬目中之數字為憑、勃郎氏稱、若謂專家僅以公司之賬目為憑、實屬不平、因專家之所以為專家、必因其對於此等事項有相當之經騐、不致僅憑公司之賬目為根據、而必須於每一數目字上、加以覆按、惟估計一事、問題至為繁複、即以英國郵局之前例言之、當該局接辦電話事業之後、原擬每五年舉行財產估計一次、但後以工作過於繁重之寄往　、計自受盤國家電話公司財產之後、約至二十年、始克舉行估計一次、彼時有所謂百分標凖者、係戰前一切費用之標準、迨歐戰告終以後、物價增高、至一九二二年、竟達百分之一百二十、且當時機件陳舊、急須加以改革、支出因此益鉅、雖價格極高、亦不能避免、嗣後物價復日漸低落、以至一九二九年為止、但在此時期之內、物價平計、總在戰前價格百分之八九十以上、結果、機件照戰前價格估計、在三千萬鎊者、戰後投資總數、竟達一萬萬鎊、且估詩必須行之於某一確定之日、但在此種情狀之下、如何與以適當之估計、誠屬疑問、如欲行之於上海之電話公司、恐至少須聘用五十人、費時一年之久云、但估價旣約之後、再遲一月行之、所得之數目、復必與前所得者絕異也、</p>
<p>某委當即調、據勃郞氏之所言、各專家確有不得不依賴於公司賬目之苦衷云、、勃郞氏對此表示絕對之異議、彼謂、各專家對於公司所供給之數目、一律以各人之經騐加以評判、各專家雖對於地產房屋之估計、並無專長、但彼等仍時時取得獨立之估計、而使工部局工務處加以審定、如解釋需要之時、如福建路分站基礎費用之浩大等、則復加以調查、故無論何人、倘知有何較良估價之方法、彼當竭誠歡迎之云、</p>
<p>關乎公司人員及薪給一端、胡瑞祥氏稱、該公司人員總數為九百十三人、平均薪給為每月一百三十二元四角九分、每月薪次總額約十二萬一千元、詳數如需要時亦可供給、財務處處長當即表示、公司現行之薪水等級、於專家所擬定之話價、並無影響、且公司薪給亦不過高、大致與其他公用事業中所有者相等、最近公司復厲行减政、節省頗多云、</p>
<p>繼各委復討論通話時間長短問題、蓋通話一分鐘為一次、通話十分鐘亦為一次、同樣收費、顯屬不公、再則無效果之通話、亦屬一問題、往往通話三四次始尋得對方之人、應如何加以計算、勃郞氏承認時間長短一律付費、確屬不公、惟欲求其公允、公司方面、勢須有三分錡計數機之添設、各國電話當局、對於此項流弊之可能、早巳計及、惟關於第二點、則與公司實無關係、蓋公司旣以相當之供應供給用戶、用戶雖通話三四次、始尋得對方之人、亦不應歸咎於公司也、惟按時計數之方法、在超越總站範圍以外時、往往即行之、在倫敦亦曾如此、在倫敦界綫以內、通話時間、毫不加以限制、公司方面、雖冒若干危險、但談話綿綿不斷之人、究居少數、若通話範圍超越倫敦界線之外、即須按時計算、但倘此種辦法行之於本埠、則各界反對之聲、勢將一發而不可止、屆時民衆攻擊之烈、恐將十百倍於今茲之反對按次收費、故本問題之提出、富有相當之危險性云、</p>
<p>再則、按次收費辦法、於用戶之中、究有若干願加以接受、亦曾論及、據中國市商會方面所表示者、中國用戶之大多數、贊成按具收費辦法、並且已作按具付費之準備、勃郎則謂、現在對於按次收費辦法之反對、俱發之於覺將蒙受損失之有組織團體、惟代大用戶付價之人、則絕無反對之聲、專家在此點曾作數千次之估計、何種用戶、每晶通話若干次、均有精密之計算、某委繼問、中國用戶之贊成按具收費辦法、已有堅強之表現、專家方面、曾否加以忽視、勃郎氏稱、今可告語者、即各專家對於按次收費辦法可行之結論、殊與此種論辯無關、蓋專家結論之取得、根據於科學之原則、彼個人對於上海用戶、並未發見何種特殊之處、如有恐即他處巳不再見之利用電話之方法、此處仍可見之云、</p>
<p>財務處處長當即於此表示意見、謂目前所需要者、即應為大多數求最高之利益、現在旣經證明在按具收費制度之下、小用戶所付話費之一部份、係代大用戶所出者、倘此後不顧專家之勸吿、猶沿用按具收費辦法、則此後機件等等、必須繼續添加、而贏利數目、亦必隨之增進、倘公司之所要求者無减低之希望、則日後話價之增加、將不止百分之十一、而為百分之二十六、而日後話機之减少、尙未計及也、然則將來用戶將於不知不覺之中、受更鉅之加價要求矣、蓋資本之投入日益增加、話價勢必隨之而上、故此後如今日之加價問題、益將層出而不窮、公司方面、殊無法自行發展其本身之組織、而獲得相當之贏利、故據彼之所見、旣欲取得贏利、須不損及用戶之大部份、即小用戶、捨按次收費辦法之外、實別無良業、若按具收費辦法長此沿用、則此後情况、將每况而愈下、至一九三六年年終、公司贏利之缺少、將達七十萬元之鉅、屆時如仍用按具收費辦法、則如何取回該項損失、惟有出之於再行加價之一途、但在按次收費制下、公司有遂漸取得贏利一分之希望、一旦贏利達到該項數目、或超過之時、話價改訂賬、即可隨時應用、而話價即有减低之可能、</p>
<p>關乎通話次數、在採用按次收費辦法之後、勢將次數不減云云、彼實無從加以理解云、財務處處長復稱、公司方面、巳允試辦一年、將來贏利超過一分以上、則歸入話費改訂同生共死上、雷氏稱、倘將來通話次數之減縮、超過百分之三七·五、則公司勢將再向工部局要求加價、財務處處長承認其說、但據彼所見者、此種危險、實較沿用按具收費制之危險為小、蓋在按具收費制下所應加之數、為額極大也、</p>
<p>勃郞氏、曾將電話對於用戶之價値、與其他消息相通之方法相較、則知按次收費制下之話費、實至低廉也、但倘用戶每年通話次數達六七千次、則將來所付出之話價、自必較現在為高也、</p>
<p>某委復提出二點、一為上海目前之狀况、此種狀况、在報吿書之後部、雖曾提及、但未能加以通盤之計算、第二點為專家未能有充分之時間、以完畢其調查工作、故本埠經濟狀况之考慮、實屬公用委員會之仔肩、公衆之呼聲雖不足長、但亦加以顧慮、再則話額百分之三七·五減縮、以彼觀之、尙屬理想上之損失、而未至實現之時、公司似不應於事前增加大衆之負擔、再則在目前情况之下、工部局百分之二年稅、似應暫緩徵收、財務處處長稱、工部局年稅、於提議之話價、並無深切之關係、另一委則謂、彼對於各專家之工作、雖極重視、但對於其報吿書、則雖贊同、因彼覺專家於調查之中、未得充分之時間、因而不得不以公司所供給之數字為計算之根據、而使加價一端、成為不易之定論、再則用戶之意見、專家方面、亦未能儘量徵採、而按具收費辦法、應繼續之理由、亦未能與以充分之考慮、彼主張時間雖極忽促、專家應再貢獻其意見、彼對於報吿書之不能贊同、不得不表示遺憾云、主席復聲明、在本問題內、各委無論作何主張、公司方面之同意、尙待徵求、蓋工部局不能勒令公司、而必須與之成立同意也、工部局代理總辦復稱、公司因贏利不足而要求加價、工部局不得不允其請求、但工部局所擬定之價目、倘仍不能給與應得之贏利、則公司方面、得拒絕接受、而將加價問題、交付促裁、至按次收費辦法、法租界工部局雖尙未表示意見、但贊成之成分極多、倘本局公用委昌會不擁護專家按次收費之主張、而法工部局贊成之、則本局之威信將受極大之損失、財務處處畏則謂、關於工部局年稅一節、倘工部局願加以放棄、則收入缺少之數、仍須均攤之於市民、而市民之大多數、仍屬電話用戶也、</p>
<p>繼勃郞氏雷氏等、對於第一階段之話額、復與他國現有制度、作一簡單之比較、最後專家報告書以大多數通過於工部局公用委員會、主席最後、復向各專家致謝其工人、遂即散會、</p>

<h3 id="c101">上海紡織業概況 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 中國徴信所主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之一）</p>
<p>1．上海紡織業之沿革及其地位</p>
<p>紡紗織布，由來久矣，惟以機器製造，在我國尙不過四十餘年之歷史。蓋自英領印度輸入機製棉舫以來，國人始知起而傲傚，淸光緒十六年，（卽民國紀元前二十二年）李鴻章氏創設機器緻布廠（俗稱洋布局）於上海楊樹浦，為上海紡織業之濫觴，亦為全國紗業之嚆矢，嗣後上海紗業之發展，可分三大階段觀察。</p>
<p>一、初創期—自光緒二十一年中日戰爭起，中經日俄戰爭，（光緒二十一年）以至民國三年歐洲大戰止，為上海紡織業之初創期，在該期內，活動之主角厥惟外商，如德商之瑞記，（後改英商）美商之鴻源，（後由英而日）英商之怡和，日商之東華等廠，皆於中日戰後紛紛成立於上海，稍後華商方面雖有振華九成同昌各廠之創設，然類多規模狹小或與外資合辦，初非獨樹一幟可言也，職是之故，再加以當時官民合辦之種種流弊，上海紡織業在初創期內所遭逢之艱險，實繁有徒，</p>
<p>二、勃興期—歐洲大戰期間及戰後數年，為上海舫織業之勃興期，亦為我國紗業之黃金時代，緣當時除東鄰之日本外，歐洲各國皆忙於戰事及戰後之復興工作，無暇東顧，稱覇全國之印棉印紗遂暫告退隱，民族紗業遂趁機而起，據統計所得，華商紗廠於是時勃興於上海者，約有申新等二十餘家，其間尤以民九所增者為最多，計有十家，然美中不足者，卽在滬日商紗廠亦以同速度而增加，且全係新創，不若華商方面有一部份乃由改組而成，故日商所增錠子有四五萬之多，超過華商者約一二萬枚，以致演至今日，外商紗廠在滬之勢力仍雄厚可觀，此吾人所應注意者也，</p>
<p>三、困難期—民國十三年以後，西歐之紡織勢力又復東來，民十五年以後，全國工商又受國民革命之影響，故上海紗業遂難言如何之發展，金責銀賤風潮期間，上海紗業雖一度向榮，但為時甚暫，至九一八事變以後，我國政治頻受特異之影響，去年又倍受美國購銀政策之襲擊，上海紡織業，（全國亦然）遂陷於極度之困難中，紗銷凝滯，存貨堆積，廠家隨而停工或閉歇，迄今尙未復驚，</p>
<p>上海紡織業之沿革已槪述如上，今更進而論其在全國紡織業中所處之地位，據華商紗廠聯合會本年三月之調查報吿，全國中外紗廠共計一四三家，上海佔六十五家，卽佔全國總廠數百分之四五·四五，卽以華廠而言，全國共計九十五家，上海佔三十一家，其比重亦在三分之一以上，由此可見，上海紗業在　國所處之地位，究有若何之重要性矣，</p>
<p>2．上海各華廠之概況</p>
<p>從前節所論，吾人巳知上海紗業之重要，惟近年以來，因各種關係之襲擊，亦與內地同樣陷於困難之境地，今將最近三年來上海各華廠之異動大勢，列表如次，</p>
<p>近三年來上海華紗廠異動表</p>
<p>就廠數而言，民二十二年較二十一年增多三家，民二十三年則維持原狀，紗業前途，頗似穩定，然而揆諸實際，又稍有不然，蓋紗錠綫錠及布機之數額雖增，但其實際開工者或不以同比例而加多，據二卷七期社會經濟月報所載，二十二年之三十一家中，有九廠减工，八廠停工，其紗錠總數一，一二六，二〇四枚之中，停减錠數達四分之之以上，計三六五，一二四枚，故一方為廠數紗錠數等等之增加，而另一方面則工人及原動力之减少，一加分析，似不容吾人樂觀也，</p>
<p>上海現存之三十一廠中，其歷史最早者為恒豐紡織新局，（其前身卽為李鴻章氏前創辦之洋布局），其次為東方（卽現在之申新七廠）同昌振，資金最大者為申新永安，其次為統益大豐等，整個陷於停工者，已有申新二五兩廠，及同昌民生經緯上海紡織四家，（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c110">政制改革的途徑（續） <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 潘公展　（二十四年十一月於上海）</p>
<p>——謹獻於中國國民黨第五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們——</p>
<p>如果說，政制不改革，則黨治不取消，訓政不桔束，因而人才不能集中，民權不能發揮；人才不集中，民權不發揮，則跋重的國難也就無法可以解除。驟聽起來，似乎也未嘗不言之有理。可是從實際情形和政治學理上來稍加推究，那末這種反對建國大綱所定程序的似是而非的議論，可以不攻而自破。</p>
<p>何以故？第一，試問「人才集中」，還是要集中於「組織」呢？還是要集中於「散漫」呢？雖三尺童子，也知道必先有相當的組織，必先嚴密其組織，而後可以集中人才。故由「無黨」政治進而為「多黨」政治（即政黨競爭的政治），更由「多黨」政治進而為「一黨」政治，乃為政治上進化的必然趨勢，也是由無組織進而致於有嚴密組織的必然步驟。現在一面要希望集中人才，一面却希望由「一黨」退而至於「多黨」，更由「多黨」退而至於「無黨」，還我中國四萬萬同胞一盤散沙的本來面目，姑無論大悖乎孫總理的遺教，就令一旦做到，豈不與集中人才的原意背道而馳？故今日不說「集中人才」則巳，如要集中，祇有網羅一般信仰三民主義的眞實人才於國民黨之中，或退十步百步，網羅那能遵守三民主義的眞實人才於聞民黨所主政的國民政府之下，共同努力，纔能舉集中之實。大凡國家愈艱危，政治力量的需要集中也愈迫切，而人才的趨向集中也愈成為自然的趨勢。大戰以後的蘇俄，進軍羅馬後的意大利，國社黨成功後的德意志，固不必說，就是英，法，日，美向來多黨競爭的國家，也有混而為一的行動，例如英國的舉國一致內閣，法國的混合內閣，日本的非常時內閣（還有內閣審議會的網羅　彥），美國的國會授權總統，無非想在多黨競爭的憲政之下，別謀集中人才集中力量的策略。可見東西各國，都因為時處非常，希望由分而合，斷不像我們這些「名流學者」，反因國勢阽危，大開倒車，而希望我國政制退回到民十三以前「多黨」擾攘或「無黨」混沌的漩渦之中的。所以「集中人才」是一事，而「取消黨治」又是一事。須知「客卿」尙可用，何况「同胞」？掌握政權的黨，如果公忠體國，一定會樂用天下的英才，祇要這些英才不是發願背叛建國的黨。蘇俄儘管是共產黨專政的社會主義國家，兩次五年計劃之中人才何嘗不集？意大利和德意志儘管是法西斯黨或國社黨專政的國家，而在對內對外的建國過程之中，人才又何嘗不集？所不願集者，僅僅那些與建國的主義不相容的人物而巳，則治理國家的人又安得人人而悅之？就拿目前的中國來說，黨外人才確多容納的事實。也儘有集中的可能。不但地方政府行政長官，黨外人才數見不鮮，即上而至於中央政府，各院部會，濟濟多士，亦何嘗完全是隸於黨籍？中此可見：黨治縱不取消，人才也能集中，兩者之間初無必然的因果關係。</p>
<p>第二，試問民權的行使是否需要訓練？如果要訓練，則訓政的要素就在乎訓練民權的行使，而為實施憲政的階梯。故今日的訓政愈完密，則他日民權的行使愈正當，而憲政的成績也愈良好。祇要讀過孫總理所手定的建國大綱，就可明白這層道理。如果說訓政不結束，民權就不能發揮，則當初軍事底定，國家統一以後，何以要有訓政的階段？國民教育不普及。參政常識不具備，四權行使不熟練，地方自治不完成，以此而談民權，論憲政，牠的結果，民治政府恐將建築於沙灘之上，殷鑒不遠，只要一翻民國成立後十二三年間的歷史，就可恍然大悟！孫總理所以在民國十三年手訂建國大綱，就是要懲前毖後，澈底地為民治政府建築一個很堅深的基礎。如今我們假使又為那些自以為是的「名流學者」請張為幻的游詞所感，搖動我們的信念，不問民智的程度如何，不問訓政的收效如何，就以為訓政不妨結束，憲法立可施行，則不但前功盡棄，而草率實行的憲政也將終於表現非驢非馬的現象·胡適以為「憲政是憲政的最好訓練」，實在是一種遁詞。須知訓練憲政的時期·在國民黨就稱之為訓政，也就是建國大綱上所說的訓政，訓政時期約法也就是訓練憲政時期的憲法。故憲政的需要訓練，巳為反對訓政的人所承認，無待更為詞費。所須說明的：憲法是國家的根本大法，頒布憲法原屬一件應該十分鄭重的事·而以為憲法一經頒布，訓政即巳完功，憲政旣經開始，憲法即須頒布，實在是大誤而特誤！建國大綱第二十二條說：「憲法草案，當本於建國大綱，及訓政，憲政兩時期之成績，由立法院議訂。隨時宣傳於民衆，以備到時採擇施行」旣說憲法草案要本於訓政憲政兩時期的成績，則可見憲政時期在前而議訂憲法草案在後。這裏所謂「憲政時期」，想當指第十六條第十九條「憲政開始時期」而言。現在還沒有一省可以看到全數之縣都巳達到完全目治，本來連「憲政開始時期」還談不到，姑且退十步百步，則目前的中國，就算要躐等而進，至多也不過跨入憲政開始時期」、的階段。所以，若不是為粉飾門面計，則訓政時期約法實在就是「憲政開始期」的根本大法，有了這一部約法，好好地運用，好好地遵守，儘可以訓練民權，也儘可以發揮民權。假使一定要另訂憲法，也祇須議訂憲政開始時期可以適用的一部憲法草案，其中必須當量包含訓政的精神，使民權在適當的範圍內加緊訓練起來，方纔眞能有利於國，有惠於民。（未完）</p>

<p>住在弄底一幢屋子裏的，是一位何先生，和一位袁先生。</p>
<p>這二位先生，眞可以代表二個環境裏的典型人物。</p>
<p>何先生是一位愛賭若命的。除非是手裏沒錢。沒有甚麼話好說。若是手裏有了錢，便會夜以繼日，廢寢忘餐的賭錢。賭得順手，那麼便似乎發了橫財了，買了魚，還得買肉，有時還拉些親戚朋友到家來大吃大喝。帶着老婆瞧電影，逛大世界，吃大菜，坐汽車。孩子要錢，一出手總是二毛。可是賭輸了呢，那便整天的不開口。孩子吵了，提起腿來，當屁股便是一腳。若是老婆對他說一句米缸空了，或是明天該付房租了，那他會畢起拳頭，把檯子打得檯上的東西，都直跳起來，還得放大着喉嚨嚷道：「你只會吃死食，我又不是做强盜的，賺錢可是這麼容易的！」</p>
<p>袁先生呢，却不是這麼。一天到晚，只是對着綠豆大的一燈，抽着鴉片。老婆向他要一塊錢買米，他只裝沒聽見，非第三次向他開口，他是絕對不肯掏腰包的。但烟缸裏沒有見底時，他却早已預備着煎了。他一年四季之中，有了錢，多煎多抽些鴉片，臉上掛一些笑容，沒有錢了，少煎少抽些，臉上笑意收歛着。對於家事，除了每天登着老婆買菜的另用賬之外，一些都不過問的。有時或說一二句「怎花得這費，一塊錢三天已花完了」之外，從沒疾言厲色的。</p>
<p>一天，何師母對袁師母說，「還是你袁們先生好。性兒耐耐的。」</p>
<p>袁師母哭喪了臉答道，「够了，要他一塊錢，眞似要了他的命。」</p>

<p>賈多才雖不說什麼，可是他的臉色，却十分的難看。向對過屋子裏看了一看，見窗子裏好幾個女人影子，就把鼻子左右，兩道斜紋伸出，向周太太苦笑了一笑。周太太道：我知道賈先生一定不高興，可是這和你太太並沒有什麼關係，你要見怪，就怪我罷。周太太說到這裏，本來還想和月英遮蓋幾句，可是月英在窗子裏早是遠遠的向這邊瞟了一眼，看見賈多才小鬍子翹了起來，瞪了兩隻荔支眼睛臉皮紅紅的。心裏這就砰砰亂跳個不了，料着就是有周太太保鑣，這事情也和緩不下來，倒不如早早的出去，認一個錯下塲。於是右手掄着衣襟上的紐扣，左手挽着放到背後，將牙齒咬了下嘴唇，斜側了身子，挨着房門出去。到了過廳裏，又把腳步站住了，閃在周太太身後。因為他走出來的腳步，是非常之輕，他直到了耳邊，周太太還不聽到。這時，賈多才的眼睛，只管向周太太身後看來，他也就隨着回頭一看，見月英低了頭站着，便向兩邊都看了一看，於是握了月英垂下去的手道：你就是要作賢妻良母，也犯不上見了先生，嚇得像老鼠見了貓一樣。說着，牽了他，只管向前送。就在這個時侯，王北海夾了一個書包，忽忽忙忙的向裏頭跑，他是只管這樣猛力的衝着，却不理會到身邊有熟人，及至到了面前，彼此一躱閃，才把腳停住了。（三六〇）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>伊也不耐煩再在殿上多坐，便怱怱地宣吿退朝，仍由我們簇擁着回宮。往常太后回宮時，一路上總得東張西看的在各處查視着：今天，伊却目不轉瞬地僅是一味的向前猛走，直接回至寢宮中去。苑內各處所開的花向為伊老人家所十分喜愛的，今天雖也有很燦爛的幾種時令花開暗，但對於伊已不發生什麼好感了；便是各處的那些小太監當伊經過時照例向伊磕頭，也不復能博得伊的一顧了。</p>
<p>往常伊的身軀原是有些傴僂的，但今天却挺得非常的直，像一個很英勇的少年君主一樣；伊彷彿在想把伊自己的身子站在伊底敵人的身上去，用力的壓住他，不使他能有爬起來打倒伊的機會。現在伊就感覺到伊肩上所負的責任底重大了！</p>
<p>我不禁暗暗在懷疑：或者這一伴事變，就是當我們從奉天回來時大家都覺得很慌張急迫底預兆的結果吧！</p>
<p>太后回到了寢宮以後，便急不及待的吩咐所有的人一起退出去，祇許留下兩個女官給伊承値，而我就是那兩個中的一個。那可憐的光緒雖然在名義上還是一個「現任」的皇帝，但凡逢國家有比較大一些的事故時，他是從來不許與聞的。（便是小事也輪不到他發表意見）此刻自然也早就給太后打發出去了。連那隆裕瑾妃也在同時奉諭退出；另外的那些宮女太監之輩，更不容遲疑地盡給太后趕了出去。（四五六）</p>

<p>— 朱</p>
<p>吳先生在內地主編了一張小報，總算已兩度寒暑了；在這種年頭，國事當然不涉小報的事，然而為了輿論關係，地方上的事情，總不能不中持公道，秉筆直書。吳先生原是關在書房裏的傻子，起初想憑這一枝禿筆權當三千毛瑟，不光明處見光明，在黑暗社會中，奮鬥出一條光明的路來！</p>
<p>吳先生的傻子計劃，實幹了幾個月，可憐！社會的黑暗，是更見濃厚；而吳先生精神和肉體上的痛苦，是够他受用了，法院的傳票，是接連的飛來，開庭，審訊，是成了家常便飯。然而社會上的人們，對於吳先生，除了幾個知己的朋友，仍保住着相當的友情；餘外的人，都聽了吳先生的大名，對着搖頭，尤其是一班縉紳先生，認為是十足搗蛋的壞人！</p>
<p>吳先生在與人法律週旋之外，還受到了幾次重大的侮辱，和傷害。他在受辱以後，常搔着他星星白髮的頭顱，恨恨的說：「編小報，簡實不是人幹的！」然而在這人浮於事的時候，又幹得何事呢？並且報館老闆，因吳先生的迭次受辱，巳由十七元的薪水，增加到二十四番大洋，他感恩知己，當然非幹下去不可。</p>
<p>「我自有我高尙的人格，是非自有公論，怕什麼呢！」他在受到刺激以後，常用這種阿Q的口吻來安慰自己！</p>
<p>然而在這種環境之下，吳先生的奮鬥勇氣，當然鼓不起來；怯弱的身體，擋不住人家的老拳，加着內的地小報旣沒有訪員，而稿費又微得等於沒有，所以報間的文章，大一半是編者的手筆。吳先生旣改變作風，閒話風月，那報紙銳利的精神，逐漸喪失，漸漸地變成了「老爺報。」</p>
<p>然而不幸得很，吳先生又因為一篇稿子，閙出了糾紛：那稿子是一個大報館記者寄來的，記事的內容，是記載某局長喪妻的新聞，在不敢駡人的環境中，這種似平庸而非平席的新聞，當然是小報的好資料，並且作者又是個奔走那機關的訪員，當然不至造謠；可是刋出來以後，突有個友人奔來向吳先生說道：「老吳：你什麼又鬧出這個岔子，某分局長的未人，好好的活着，你怎麼造出這種謠言，現在某局長因報上的新聞，接到了十餘處的吊箔，心中大怒，已請律師提起控訴，非法律解决不可了。吳先生聽了消息不確，心中當然覺得抱歉，因此翼挽那朋友調解，可是那朋友卻搖了搖頭說：「我已替你說過，他早一口拒絕，實在不能効勞。」</p>
<p>吳先生在這種環境之下，也不能不作涉訟的抵禦工作。第一步，把那作稿的記者我來，詢問那消息的來源、，那位記者忙取出一紙某局長太太身故的報喪條，並且印着某局的郵寄信對，常然不是朋友所造的謠言，於是吳先生為博訪起見又在別家報館搜集了若干報條，好得報館中的某老闆，是新任了律師，於是吳先生就前去相訪，探詢法律的保障；某老闆那天是特別高興一口對吳先生說毫無問題，假使不是某局長來函更正，聽他起訴，不加理睬。</p>
<p>吳先生得某老闆的保障以後，很氣壯的回館服務，可是那位報信的朋友，已候在編輯室裏，開口就說「某局長巳自願和解了，祇要刊一則更正啟事，事兒就過去了。」吳先生起初當然是一口拒絕，可是經不起那位朋友再三的要求，吳先生想起那友人的來意，總是一翻好心，打官司究不是快樂的事，於是吳先生就違背了某老闆的命，另撰了一則更正的新聞；這麼一來，事態是鬧大了，某老闆勃然大怒，而吳先生的飯碗因老闆之一怒，就宣吿了碎裂。</p>
<p>吳先生踏出了報館，呆立在街角上：他想到來日的生活，他想到了老闆的威風，他想到了朋友的友情，斜陽是漸漸下去，吳先生的人影也越拖越長；他茫然，茫茫然說：「我自有我高尙的人格，怕什麼呢！…」</p>

<p>— Lonisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「謝謝先生」，康恩說着，勉力想不要粗暴，覺得倒也不如他所想的那麼困難。</p>
<p>『現在，看看那隻腳，啊赫——這不好。明天我們須得請費爾德大夫來。蜀，拿些熱水和紗布來。』</p>
<p>裴先生洗了幷包了那隻受傷的腳，蜀夫人預備了那屋子裏惟一的空眠牀，那牀是安在坐落間外的小客室裏，童子們不適意的時候往往用着，因為這可以省得蜀夫人跑上跑下，病人也不至於寂寞，等到牀已預備好了，裴先生用兩臂抱了一個小夥子，送他進了房，帮他脫了衣服，放他在小的白的牀上，最後和他一握手，幷且以父親般的神氣說道，「望你一夜好好安眠，我的孩子，」然後離去。</p>
<p>唐恩立即睡着，熟睡了數小時，然後他的腳又開始抽跳作痛，他醒來將身子翻着，極感不安，忍着不呻吟，免得別人聽見，因為他確是一個勇士，忍着痛苦，眞像一個「好漢。」</p>
<p>蜀夫人晚間要出來巡視着全屋子，巳經習以為常，這樣，如果風急天寒了可以將窗子關上，可以整理着坦第牀上的蚊帳，也可以照顧着韜摩，因為他有時睡夢裏會　個起來行走的。一點兒的聲息便可以打醒了她，她有時聽到了聲音，以為是盜賊，狸貓，或者竟是大火，四壁的門戶儘自開着，所以那晚她銳敏的耳朶聽釗了唐恩微微的呻吟，她就立刻起來了。他正在給他的熱枕頭以失望的重撞，忽然看見一個燈火從那門衖裏閃霎則來，接着巳見到蜀夫人溜進了房間，看去像一個可笑的鬼物，因為她的髮巳束成一個結，正在頭頂中心，後面拖着梳妝時用的一件灰色的長袍。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言社會局取締抬高物價  行安　　自四日財部緊急法令頒布後，各地市上最先受影響的，為物價的增漲。這種現象，雖為一時的刺激使然，但不無少數商人從中操縱。查財部這次施行新貨幣政策，原為復興經濟，安定金融的謀國大計，至關緊要。乃一般奸商，只圖私利，不顧大局，竟爾乘機居奇，殊屬不法。故當局又有通令取締抬高物價之舉，這不能不認為救濟的要策。　　關於取締辦法，頃社會局已規定四項：（一）各同業公會，應於三日內，按照成本的多少，議定價目，議定的價目，如超越成本過多，而有故意抬高物價之嫌者，以違抗中央命令論，由各該公會全體執監委員負責。（二）各同業公會議定價目，得先通知各同業遵守，一面將議定的價目單及核議標準，同時補呈到局備案。（三）各同業公會不論有無業規或業規已否核准，所議定價目單，各該同業無論專營兼營，會員或非會員，須一律强制遵守。（四）違反議定價目，而任意跌價者，得依照核准業規辦理。這辦法是極切要的。　　然我們覺得議定價目，聽各同業公會自行規定，尚有不妥。這事應由黨政機關及各同業公會，合組一物價評定委員會，負責處理，方為適當。這方法南京市等地已實行，本市亦可仿效。評議範圍，尤應以人民日常必需品，先行規定，以免居民受物價增漲之苦。例如遏止米價的高漲，這是刻不容緩的。至價目議定後，一方由評議會公布，他方亦須製成價目表，令各業懸掛，使購者不致受愚。否則物價雖經規定，難保無暗中抬高出售者。　　聞某專家所主防止物價上漲，以貨幣數量操縱之說，當局謂現實無這需要。蓋物價的漲落，與貨幣數量為比例。貨幣數量增加，則物價亦隨之而漲。貨幣數量减少，則物價亦隨之而落。現在貨幣數量，旣無甚增加，則物價實無從上漲，目前所有的現象，係暫時的，不久當仍趨歸於平穩。故我們顧本市各同業，能不為一時的利益所蔽，切實奉行政府的通令。這不但居民受其賜，卽新貨幣政策的施行，亦不至有所妨碍。而各業營業的發展，亦可以蒸蒸日上。誠一舉而三得也。</p>

<p>懷鄕  羅之華　　為什麼又懷念起家來了，弟弟，我沒有方法把我懷鄉的情緒用一家傳出來。當然你也是不懂家是什麼東西的，是在怎樣地使一個人傻頭傻腦地瞎想，想着並不怎樣値得懷念的家鄉。　　比方我吧，街上的秋葉一經凋落，冬天的氣味便鐵一樣生長在我的心裏了。然而，我在你們眼睛裏不是看作一個不考的，不値得愛的人生嗎？——我沒有通知爸爸和媽媽，就殘忍地乘車出走了，惹得你們好久沒得安心。這樣的一個人怎樣能够再想起家來呢？眞是奇怪得很，連我也怪。　　菊池寬在他的「父歸」裏曾說到那個年老的父親之所以回去是由於他的年紀老了，他想起家。田漢的「南歸」裏的流浪者是由於他厭倦了北國的風光，他想起美麗的江南，美麗的光南的春天。但是，我的年齡還年靑呵，而這地方却巳不能留戀我。　　按照往日讀書和觀察別人所得到的結果，我明白，一個人在二十歲的前後充滿了幻想，這些幻想是美麗的，誘惑人離開家庭，學校，往社會上走去。社會的鐵臉把他的幻想破滅了；於是，在三十歲前後就沉湎於回憶裏，回憶着叫人興奮或嘆息的往事。　　而我現在應當是一個充滿了幻想的人。弟弟，你一定很愛空想，人家剛剛說一句話，你從這一句話裏就能够發出許多許多的想頭。因為我曾經這樣過。那時，自然心境是很年靑的，早晨或晚上，（就說是整個的日子吧，）無論在作什麼事，比方正看着書，外邊一聲狗咬把注意力分散以後，許多美好的事情便展開在眼前了。比方說將來如何去學習功課，去學習外國語，去外國，……有時正找一本書，（找一本算學教科書吧，）手不知怎麼拿錯了，這一錯，就錯下去了：忘記了你是在找算學教科書。我想你一定也有這類的經騐的，弟弟。　　現在，我很想冉回復到這境地却不可能了。　　我從家裏跑出來是幻想鼓勵了我。我空想着出走以後的生活。但是，現在我是孤零零的一個。　　每天，早晨起來，翻翻報紙，就過完了。吃吃飯，玩一玩，在一間小房子裏踱踱步，寫寫文章，盼盼信，一天就完了。在這一天內我接觸不到一個人。在街上走跑，和別人不發生關係，寫文章，看報，吃飯，都是孤獨地一個人。這樣的生活把我幻想的泡沫完全打破了。你當然還不明白孤獨者的痛苦。在以先，（你現在也許如此，）我曾想，假如果世界上剩餘下我自己了，那該是多麼自由呀！我喜歡吃什麼就吃什麼，穿什麼就穿什麼，住在山洞裏或十八層天堂裏也沒人管我，我該多樣自由呀！現在，我的確是和這相差不遠的地步了：我很「自由，」——高興了唱歌，悲哀了哭，睏了睡覺，醒後就起來，（躺着誰也管不着，）但是，現在的我倒願意能够回到那雜亂的家裏去。而日想着：使一個人孤獨是一條最殘酷的刑罰。　　家，多樣叫我懷念呀，那可愛的你們，每天不是依在門口望我歸來嗎？年紀漸老的母親不是在數着日月嗎？而我呢，我也厭倦了這旅途的孤獨。　　我淸淸楚楚地記着你和妹妹的笑臉，和母親的慈祥。我看着書，你們的影子來了；和朋友談着話，你們的影子來了：你們的靈魂時時刻像一曲音樂似地圍繞着我。我想，我你懷鄉的心也把你們網住了：你們盼我回去，依在門口的石獅上。　　弟弟，等着吧，我的影子就要到達你們的身邊了。那時，我成了家裏的一個成員。自然，懷鄉的事情，是沒有了。散品兩章  西蒙　　（一）叩門聲　　在凝靜到幾乎只能聽着自己的呼吸，此外萬物都歸於死滅的午夜，而又當我給一些苦惱攪擾得不能安睡的時候，便溜下床，用着慣常的腳步，悵然地踱近窗口，悵然地望着黑沉沉的天空，又悵然地退回來，悵然地坐在明朗的燈光下發楞。　　連着好幾天都是這樣，今夜依然是這樣，於是一陣輕輕地敲着門環的銅屬音韻，在沒有一絲聲息的空氣里，那輕輕的音韻便重重地停落在我的耳根上來，彷彿遠處古寺的搖鐘，帶着濃濁的凄凉味，和着原野的風蜿蜓過來，襲擊着我整個兒的神經。於是我悵然地站起來，悵然地走到窗邊，悵然地把視綫落在微暗的燈照着的弄堂的巷里，就在這時候，不知那家的門突的開了，我的眼睛卽刻投向有聲嚮發出來的地方：我瞧見一幅女人的背影急急地閃了進去了。　　於是我悵然關了窗，悵然地踱回來。　　要看淸楚那女人的嘴眼，似乎成為我一種奇怪的慾念，在我不能安睡，給一些苦惱攪擾着的午夜，我預先開了窗，悵然地站立着，不惜叫寒風吹得打冷噤，可是我並不知時辰的遲早，等着等着，半天不見什麼踪跡，覺得有點不耐煩，便悵然地離開窗前，在屋子里來往繞方步，當我正悵然地坐下去，那銅屬的音韻却淸晰地浮上來，我敏捷地走上窗前，但是敲門的人已經踏過門檻走進門內去，却有着更艷麗的服裝的背影投入眼廉中。　　我失望，又悵然地關好窗。　　每夜每夜，在差不多同樣的時間內，在飄雪的日子，在括大風的日子，在淋雨的日子，那叩門聲從不曾間斷過，漸漸地，我聽得爛熟了。亦漸漸地，我明白一個在深夜奔波的女人，所過的是什麼生涯了。　　落着繽紛的雪和雨的時候，在屋子里的人是多麼安適，而在路上蹌踉的人却是多麼難堪，却使是一個簡陋的家，可是終有着溫暖的氣氛，明亮的燈，也會像追尋天堂那樣懷着異樣歡樂的心，加急了步子吧。我想着那女人或正許是迷惘於凄凉的街道間也如自己一樣不幸的流浪者啊！可是坐在屋子里的現在，是應該威到滿足的。並且用着鑑賞的情緒去數着窗外雨的起落，然而一聆到那串從細微的雨聲里送來的門環的銅屬音韻，另後像一縷怨魂似的蕩漾在屋內，我便不由地悵然起來，悵然地不知在思索什麼，感覺鉛一樣的沉重，有無邊的鬱悴稠雲似的圍繞着我。　　為着此，我常時於無眠的夜聽雨到天明。　　（二）冬天了　　一陣雨，一陣風；又一陣風，雨跟着，把日子送冷了。又到冬天哪，意識着冰凍的季候夢在漸漸挨近，還會有春天嬌艷的花，嫩葉的色，讓你去欣賞吟咏麼，河流不久就將結成泳床的，枝頭的殘葉楚嗚咽到深谷中去了，虫也蟄藏在地窟底。　　等明年柳樹投着濃影於池塘的時候，再去拾起你的墮夢吧。冬天黑是找不着婉囀的黃鶯語的，便連溫煦的陽光也輕易大不露出來天，總是擺着古銅色的陰霾的臉廳，暗雲在簇簇抑飛翔，天體如同將崩落來，飄雪片的日子是不遠的了。　　可是南方是依然有晨的嫩綠色，和遲開的大菊子的飄香，為什麼不回去呢，為什麼要在北方忍受重感的壓迫呢？南方不是有明媚的季候迎着你。　　然而一個流浪者啊！冬天了，有怎樣的感覺？秋之雨天  李夾人　　秋之細雨天是會給人以留戀底魅力的，耽緬於晦澀約天色裏，本來亦頗為晦澀的心境倒能明快地，再不會有常日那麼陰黯之感了。　　近來更有着漠然於懷的怏悒呢，特別是在靜的時刻裏，老覺得自己有着一顆不安定的心，充足的陽光則更帶有窘悶的意味了，過度的光熱，令人眩然地。　　雨之夜是頗有凉爽的味感的，如果披上雨衣散步在靜的柏油路面，或竟流連在海濱的沙灘上，從凝結着的雲之縱隙間慢慢地搜尋着稀少的閃星，這情景是極風情地的。　　愛雨的孩子有着憂悒的顏色，而雨天是我最愛唸的詩句呢。有着醉人的魅力地，我輕適的步子也神經於其淸新的美之音韻間了。那麼一顆顆的洒着，輕快地落在自己的身上，明朗的心境會因之更明朗着。　　秋是多雨的季節，秋之雨是那麼勻小適度而足够給人魅力之引誘的，但雨天的星星則更有戀人的明眸般地風姿呢，閃在遠遠的天野流散着明媚的亮光，憂悒的孩子滿腹的憂悒亦為之散失完盡了。　　長遠耽身於雨之魅力吧，有如一條小魚遊泳於雨之水池吧，那麼晶瑩地，似露之留滯於荷葉面，更似戀人的眼瞳在懷想裏，秋之雨的夜成為我戀念最高峯的瀑泉了。播音歌曲介紹　　漁村之歌　　層層的海雲　揚，映照着綠水底魚光。張開破魚網：迎面晒太陽，海風吹過來陣陣凉，送來海魚香。潮水漲：波聲狂：漁船兒飄飄出漁鄕。浪花打雙漿；遠山霧茫茫；捕魚人兒不怕浪頭强；揚帆向海洋。層層的海水飄盪，盪盡了漁人慘傷。父命傷漁船；爺命傷魚網。生生死　里死海洋，痛苦向誰講？浪花狂；魚深藏；捕不得魚兒債難償！魚兒賤如糠；魚稅兇似狼，捕魚人兒一世好凄凉，挖肉來補瘡！歌唱　　上海歌劇社　　大中華（二六〇）下午六時至七時　　有止柳梢頭　（周璇　　別矣巴黎　（秋影）　　蘇三不要哭　（徐健）　　母親　（周潔）　　小妹妹的心　（秋影）　　船家曲　（周璇）　　龍虎鬥　（周潔）　　夜深深　（徐健）　　新新（七八〇）下午七時至八時　　芭蕉葉上詩　（周璇）　　燕帶春來　（秋影）　　賣油條　（徐健）　　偉大的手　（周潔　　戰地之花　（秋影）　　戀愛明星　（鬧璇）　　你要那一個抱　（周潔）　　吿別南洋　（徐健）　　李樹德堂（九四〇）下午九時至十時　　我們的皇后　（周璇）　　火線西施　（秋影）　　逍遙調　（徐健）　　女軍人歌　（周潔）　　月下如音　（秋影）　　民族之光　（周璇）　　蘇武牧羊　（周潔）　　戀人的心弦　（徐健）　　芙蓉團　　東陸（六四〇）下午七時一刻至八時　　燕帶春來　（雪雪）　　窮富姻緣　（雪琦）　　賣油條　（雪露）　　劍鋒之下　（雪雪）　　蝴蝶姑娘　（雪琦）　　慈母搖籃曲　（雪露）　　大同歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）下午七時三刻至八時半　　凱旋歌　（姚莉）　　小小茉莉　（楊瓊）　　體育皇后　（林鶯）　　好時光　（姚莉）（王琪）　　花開為你　（戴萍）　　雙料情人　（王琪）　　等一等吧　（林鶯）（戴萍）　　航空救國　（王琪）　　丁香社　　東陸（六四〇）下午八時至八時三刻　　南海美人　（姚英）　　英雄夫婿　（綠茵）　　戰地之花　（姚莉）　　戀愛明星　（金光）　　快樂家庭　（姚英）　　窮富姻緣　（綠茵）　　求愛秘訣　（姚莉）　　天倫之愛　（姚英）　　大上海社　　華美（一〇六〇）下午九時至十時　　寄生草　（前奏）　　聽聽聽　（飛亞）　　良辰美景　（曼麗）　　小鸚哥　（飛虹）　　雙料情人　（飛亞）（飛虹）　　秋夜簫聲　（文仙）　　心琴曲　（文仙）　　電影院中　（曼麗）　　小小書眉鳥　（飛亞）（飛虹）彈詞　　朱筱麟開篇　　新聲（一三八〇）下午一時半至二時半　　開篇「果報錄平反」　　滿城賊寇勢猖狂。縱火燒房四處慌。毛老大人傳將令。御林軍士盡戎裝。驚大動地連環砲。無數剛刀無數槍。四面城門多緊閉。毛家父子早提防。軍師被斬江彬獲。張保無謀走落荒。無奈越城逃出外。三羅城有兩重牆。狹路相逢唐八妹。帶兵駐紮近關廂。當時活獲捉生擒。猛虎工夫勝異常。不多幾個從亡漢。一半逃生一半亡。切鼎之仇今始洩。况兼擒賊必擒王。紅旗捷報宮中心。兄弟同心保奏忙。樓上君臣眺望久。幸而兵火巳無光。當今天子無窮苦。剿滅無餘諒不妨。張保囚車曾解到。法司三位審當堂。讞定凌遲嚴密防。　　夏何生三笑　　敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時　　開篇「紅樓夢平兒理妝」　　秋高氣爽淡淡風。大觀園點綴奪天工。姊妹花枝多有興。吟詩作賦樂無窮。這一天鳳姐生辰日。花廳慶壽喜融融。誰知醋海風波起。　二奶奶。大發雷霆怒氣冲。無故痛打嬌婢子。俏平兒。滿懷委屈恨萬重。幸有衆人來分解。寳二爺相勸到怡紅。題起傷心兩淚溶。襲人寳玉忙寬慰。說道姐姐呀。二奶奶素來量寬洪。一時誤會將你責。怪只怪。璉二爺作事理欠通。勸姐姐。快去重梳洗。莫把此事掛在胸。平姑娘聽說抬身起。急忙忙。坐對菱花整玉容。重掃娥眉勾粉面。口點胭脂一點紅。並蒂秋蕙鬢邊挿。烏雲巧挽髻玲瓏。妝扮得。好似嫦娥離月殿。又如仙女下九重。引得寳玉多情子。暗裏憐惜女嬌容。堪嘆。空有這如花貌。不辛列婢妾中。呌紅顏薄命自占同。美術　　毛執中美術講習座　　航業（一一八〇）下午五時半至六時一刻　　繪畫之研究（下）取象於天地萬物，師法於迭化四時，證之於古人，出之己意，表現性情之高原，發揚民族之精神。（二）教畫今日下午四時祚李樹德（九四〇）播講兒童美育及敎畫。餘音　　本埠元昌費吿公司廣播電台前在舊址突吿失慎火燬以來，已九月於茲，後經呈請交通部國際電信局核准遷移菜市路二讓坊七號為新址，積極進行恢復，從事建新，所有機件工程亦經吿竣，巳奉交通部頒給第二十七號播音執照云。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Fifth National Congress, which the entire nation eagerly anticipates, held a grand and solemn opening ceremony at the Premier's Mausoleum on the morning of the 12th. Central Committee members from various regions, as well as representatives from provinces and cities across the country and overseas, came to Nanjing to participate enthusiastically, creating an unprecedented spectacle. The 12th coincided with the anniversary of the Premier's birth, so before the opening ceremony, a ceremony of paying respects at the mausoleum and commemorating the anniversary of the Premier's birth was held first. People from all walks of life in Nanjing City attended the grand event, hanging flags to celebrate, and the entire city presented a fervent atmosphere. The capital's police, from outside Zhongshan Gate to around the mausoleum, were stationed at their posts, and order was extremely solemn and orderly. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>All Representatives Paid Respects at the Mausoleum</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 12th, the weather was overcast and drizzling, but the Central Committee members and representatives went to the Premier's Mausoleum around 7 o'clock and arrived around 9 o'clock. They all gathered on the platform in front of the memorial hall. The foremost was the seat for the chairman, with a set of broadcasting equipment. Behind it was the seat for the Central Committee members, standing in seven rows according to age. Further back was the seat for the representatives, also standing in several rows. The seat for military representatives was arranged on the left. The Central Committee members and representatives who participated, except for the military representatives who wore military uniforms, all wore blue robes and black mandarin jackets, which was very neat and solemn. At 9:40, the ceremony of paying respects at the mausoleum and commemorating the anniversary of the Premier's birth was held. Cai Yuanpei presided over the ceremony, led the ceremony, and presented wreaths. Afterwards, he led the procession into the mausoleum to pay respects to the Premier's remains. They then returned to their positions, and the ceremony was completed. At 10:00 sharp, the opening ceremony of the Fifth National Congress was held. Chairman Lin Sen, after leading the ceremony, delivered the opening address in front of the broadcasting equipment in a calm and clear voice while the entire venue was silent. It lasted fifteen minutes before it was over, and the entire venue responded with enthusiastic applause. After the speech, music was played, and the ceremony was completed. After taking photos, they went into the city. The afternoon of the 12th was a rest, and the preparatory meeting was held at 9:00 on the morning of the 13th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Sen Delivered the Opening Address</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the opening ceremony of the Fifth National Congress, Chairman Lin Sen delivered the opening address, the original text of which is as follows: "It has been exactly four years since the Fourth National Congress. After several postponements due to unavoidable reasons, we are finally holding the Fifth National Congress today. The Central Party Affairs Report will provide further explanations regarding the process of preparation and postponement, which need not be repeated. Our repeated postponements were, of course, due to various factual reasons, but the main reason was to hope that the congress would have more opportunities to gather ideas and benefits, so that everyone could express a more enthusiastic and united spirit at the congress. The number of representatives and Central Committee members participating in this congress exceeds the records of previous sessions, because the internal unity situation has improved more than during the Fourth National Congress. This is something that all party comrades must feel very comforted by. The date of our meeting is the Premier's birthday. After everyone visited the Premier's Mausoleum, they came to participate in the opening ceremony. Everyone must feel in their hearts that the Premier's great spirit is shining upon us. All comrades remember the Premier's instructions and understand the dangers of the current national situation. Everyone must feel two questions in their hearts: (1) How much effort have we made for the revolutionary and nation-saving mission that the Premier left us? (2) What should be the path for our future efforts and struggles? These two points are precisely the mission of the Representative Congress, that is, to check the work that has been done and to determine the future direction. Our party bears the responsibility of building the nation. During the Representative Congress, compatriots across the country are paying attention to the progress of our congress. How should we all take the Premier's spirit as our spirit, carry forward the Premier's unfinished business, comfort the expectations of compatriots across the country, inspire a united patriotic enthusiasm, revitalize the decline, and save the precarious national destiny? In the past four years, the national disasters that the country has encountered have been multiplied, making it difficult to describe them all. The Fourth National Congress was held at the beginning of the occurrence of national disasters. Today, the severity of the national disasters is ten times greater than it was then. Due to the deepening of foreign troubles, coupled with water and drought disasters, bandit troubles, and drastic economic changes, the people of the whole country have tasted humiliation, displacement, and suffering. Those who blame us say that our work cannot correspond to the urgent situation of national crisis. Those who forgive us think that we have not made upward efforts in these years, and the country and the people have not made considerable progress. It is only that the changes in the world situation and the increasing external difficulties prove that the work of revolutionary nation-saving is going through a very hard test. Whether it is blame or forgiveness, we all feel that we should spur ourselves on. Standing in the position of the party, we are really ashamed of the Premier and our revolutionary duties. Speaking of the party's responsibility to the country, it can really be said that we have failed the general public. In order to complete our mission, we should of course have a deeper level of introspection and effort. The congress will have strict checks on past work during the meeting to make resolutions, but the most important task, especially, is to create a path for future efforts, so that our party and the entire nation can unite to fulfill the responsibility of saving the country and revitalizing it. Therefore, regarding the party's charter and the promotion of party affairs, we should consider whether there are any areas that should be improved, and study how to effectively improve them, so that our party can truly shoulder the heavier responsibility than the general public in the work of revolutionary nation-saving to realize the Premier's teachings. Regarding the future political, domestic and foreign facilities, and all construction, we should carefully discuss and establish detailed and appropriate guidelines. Regarding uniting the people to fight together, we should discuss how to inspire the enthusiasm of the whole country and concentrate the minds and talents of the whole country to jointly overcome the difficulties. We believe that the representatives attending the meeting will surely have very perfect proposals and very detailed discussions to make practical and effective resolutions to comfort the expectations of the entire party and the entire country. We feel that our current work should focus on the future, because our party is a party with a mission of the times, and the times are always advancing. Comparing the situation of today with the era of the Fourth National Congress, there is a significant change that makes us feel excited. This is the people's attitude towards our party. During the Fourth National Congress, the general public did not seem to have a very deep understanding of the country's environment and future. They only had a one-sided blame or dissatisfaction with our party, and even doubted the Premier's nation-saving ideas and all his teachings because of their dissatisfaction with the party. Today, most intellectuals and enlightened citizens have changed their one-sided blame to the expectation of increasing responsibility. The public opinion outside the party only blames us for not fully fulfilling the mission entrusted to us by the Premier, and constantly urges the party to work hard and cherish itself, and is willing to work together with the party under one goal to strive for the construction and revitalization of the country. This reassuring change, on the one hand, proves the greatness of the Premier's teachings and doctrines, and represents the progress of our times. But at the same time, it also makes all of us, as party members, feel the weight of responsibility more than ever. If we cannot work together to truly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country, we will not only be sinners to the Premier. Therefore, it makes us think of the instructions that the Premier earnestly warned party members during the First National Congress. The Premier said at the time that our Kuomintang must have a spirit of unity, first to sacrifice freedom, and second to contribute ability. He also stated that only when individuals can sacrifice freedom can the entire party obtain freedom, and only when individuals can contribute ability can the entire party have ability. Only when the party has freedom and ability can it undertake the great cause of revolution to transform the country. The Premier said these words more than ten years ago, but when we observe the path of success of many emerging countries in the past ten years, who have struggled from difficulties and dangers, it is really nothing more than the two sentences of sacrificing freedom and contributing ability. Unfortunately, we have not been able to fully follow the Premier's profound insights and foresight in the past. In fact, to organize a sound revolutionary nation-saving group, it is necessary for all party members to be able to sacrifice freedom and contribute ability. To create an independent and free country, it is nothing more than to make all citizens be able to sacrifice freedom and contribute ability for the country. This precise and unyielding theory is truly the great way for our future efforts. Sacrificing freedom means being able to restrain oneself, and contributing ability means being able to serve. We must use the spirit of sacrificing freedom within the party to move the people of the whole country to sacrifice freedom for the country. We must also work harder to contribute our ability so that we can unite and the people of the whole country can contribute their ability to serve the country. At this juncture of safety and danger, prosperity and decline, restating the Premier's teachings makes us feel more profound significance. We hope that all comrades will fully express the spirit of these two instructions to fulfill our due mission. I respectfully wish the congress success." (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>The Process of Postponing the Congress</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fourth National Congress was held on November 12th of the 20th year of the Republic. According to the party charter, the Fifth National Congress should be held in November of the 22nd year of the Republic. However, in April of that year, the Central Committee, in order to resolve whether or not to convene the National Assembly in advance, decided in the 64th Standing Committee meeting to convene a temporary representative assembly in July, and issued notices to party headquarters at all levels at home and abroad to select student representatives. Later, because the work of suppressing bandits had not been completed, it was decided to suspend the temporary assembly and retain the qualifications of the elected representatives, changing them to representatives attending the Fifth National Congress. On September 28th of that year, the 90th Central Standing Committee meeting decided to postpone the Fifth National Congress for one year due to the relationship of suppressing bandits. On October 25th of the 23rd year of the Republic, the Central Committee still based on the requests of various party headquarters to allow the completion of the work of suppressing bandits, and decided to postpone it again. The Fifth Plenary Session decided on December 11th to hold the Fifth National Congress today. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Following the order to switch to legal currency in Yuguan, unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to spread rumors, and the prices of rice, wheat, and copper coins skyrocketed. The market was unstable. A certain foreign rōnin took the opportunity to purchase and hoard a large number of copper coins and legal currency, resulting in a shortage of spot goods. Each dou of japonica rice increased by 6 jiao, each liter of rice increased by 1 jiao 5, each bag of wheat increased by 6 jiao, and the prices of all goods increased. Banks and money houses in Yuguan and Qinhuangdao held an emergency meeting on the 10th to seal up the stored silver and not redeem it, and reported it to Tianjin Bank. However, because it was not easy to concentrate the purchases by a certain foreigner, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would persuade the merchants to automatically exchange silver for banknotes. The silver stored in Qinhuangdao is about 100,000 yuan, and the silver stored in Yuguan is about 30,000 yuan. All of them will be transported to Tianjin for sealing before the 15th.

<h3 id="e27">China's Currency Reform Was Not Instigated by the UK <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Roos Did Not Propose a Loan to China to Japan Either. All Countries Benefit from the Stability of Chinese Finance</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that Japan intends to reply to the UK, refusing to participate in the international loan to China, because China did not consult with Japan first before announcing currency reform. People in London were surprised by this news. China's currency reform was neither instigated by the UK nor due to British assistance. Although representatives of the UK, Japan, and the United States had experimental discussions on the matter of international loans to China, since Sir Arthur Salter, the economic advisor to the British government, traveled to the Far East, the UK has not put forward specific measures regarding loans to China to Japan. Therefore, people in London felt that it was even more strange that Japan intended to send a note to the UK during this discussion phase, solemnly declaring its unwillingness to participate in international loans to China. The Japanese warlords' recognition of the UK's loan to China as an accomplished fact has received considerable attention from the British press today, but the British government may not attach much importance to it. According to responsible sources, the UK has not proposed a separate loan to China, because the UK is aware of its obligations to the banking group and cannot take this step without long and careful consideration. Today's editorial in The Times calls for a purely monetary plan. It is a pity if the Japanese insist on objecting in error and accuse it of having political implications. It should be known that if currency and financial reforms can be effectively adopted, then not only China will benefit from the more stable Chinese financial system, but all countries that have business relations with China, especially Japan, will benefit from it as well.

<p>(London) Regarding the British government's invitation to participate in the London Naval Conference opening on December 5, the Italian government has not yet responded. Those in charge here have commented on Italy's delayed response, saying that it is possible that Italy will not participate in the naval conference. However, Italy's decision to do so will not be related to the Italo-Ethiopian conflict. (11th Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) Rear Admiral Johnson, commander of the US Naval Air Force base, still advocated maintaining the 5:5:3 ratio of the US, British, and Japanese navies. Johnson said in a speech here today that there are sufficient reasons to restore this ratio system.

<p>Miyakonojo: The army maneuvers continued in heavy rain for several days and closed after the final decisive battle was fought on the Hyuga Plain on the morning of the 12th. The Emperor is scheduled to hold a review ceremony tomorrow. The location of next year's special grand exercises is said to have been determined to be the Hokkaido area. (12th Japanese League Telegram)</p>
<p>Miyakonojo: The Eastern Army, which broke through the vigilance positions of Matsumoto and Yamato and advanced to the Noseki-Shiwachi area before dawn, engaged in melee combat in enemy territory. Meanwhile, the Western Army also launched a bombardment of the Eastern Army's positions at 6:00 AM from its headquarters, using its central artillery as its main force. The Eastern Army's artillery also began to retaliate. Thereafter, the battle line gradually expanded, and at 8:00 AM, the Eastern Army switched to the offensive, attempting to annihilate the Western Army on Mount Wanitsuka. It concentrated its attack on the center of the right wing. The Western Army also used its superior forces to try to counterattack and annihilate the enemy. As a result, the main forces fought on the entire line. Aircraft from both armies were dispatched to the front line before the battle at dawn, attempting to establish air supremacy and to scout the enemy's situation. As soon as the battle on the ground began, they began to participate in the bombing and launch a three-dimensional war. When the battle became white-hot and victory and defeat were undecided, the Command Department raised the signal fire to end the exercise and blew the ceasefire bugle. At this point, the grand exercises that had been held for days were closed. The time was exactly 10:46 AM. (12th Den-tsu Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Dedication to the Fifth National Congress <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress opened yesterday. There were more representatives from various regions than in previous sessions, which is a sign of internal unity and progress within the Kuomintang. The National Congress is the highest authority of the Kuomintang and has the power to change and decide on the party constitution and platform. At the same time, it is the only body to elect the 5th Central Executive Committee. Therefore, its mission is more important than the usual Central Committee plenary session. It is also because of this that it bears a heavier responsibility to the party and the nation. Here, we sincerely hope that all the attending officials can recognize their mission and responsibilities and console the ardent hopes of the people.</p>
<p>Today, the people of the country can be said to have accepted the Kuomintang's doctrine and principles in principle and mostly deeply believe that they are the only way to build the country. What they are not satisfied with is that although the Kuomintang has a brilliant and bright doctrine and platform, it has failed to earnestly promote and fulfill them as soon as possible. For example, restricting capital and equalizing land ownership are the essence of the Kuomintang's Principle of People's Livelihood. However, in the past seven or eight years, has there been anything similar to this kind of policy? The most important mass training during the period of political tutelage is the training of the four rights. However, after six years of political tutelage, it has not been possible to do this. Other grand plans that can be spoken of but not acted upon are also countless. We know that the occurrence of this phenomenon is mostly due to the internal and external troubles that have plagued us in recent years and the lack of both human and financial resources. However, the Kuomintang's failure to make its best efforts and the lack of enthusiasm among ordinary party members to promote the doctrine should not fail to be a major reason. How to remedy these abuses and make amends, and strive to save the situation, is what the officials attending the conference today should pay attention to and carefully plan for.</p>
<p>The national crisis is no greater than it is today. The Kuomintang is at the forefront of this crisis and has become the target of criticism. For a time, celebrities and scholars mostly advocated ending political tutelage as soon as possible and opening up the party ban, as if there was no other way to save the country. However, in all fairness, China's current national crisis is the culmination of the accumulation of historical events in recent decades and cannot be solely blamed on the Kuomintang. Even if the Kuomintang immediately handed over power today, we dare to assert that China's national crisis would not only not necessarily be alleviated, but might even be aggravated. Why? Today's national crisis is mostly due to the fact that our country does not have the conditions of a modern country. The Kuomintang has a history of several decades and hundreds of thousands of party members. Its doctrines and policies are all major principles and laws that are indispensable for building a modern country. If such a party holds the national power and still cannot achieve anything, and it is said that handing over this power to other temporary small political groups of three or two people can make the country come back to life, who can believe it if they are not foolish and tasteless? Therefore, those who can truly understand the truth should not attribute the severity of the national crisis to the Kuomintang. However, in order to live up to the trust of the people, the Kuomintang should make its various checks redeemable as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Responding to League of Nations Sanctions, Italy Launches a Twofold Counterattack: Protesting to Sanctioning Countries on One Hand, and Implementing Import Controls and Retaliation on the Other <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini has retaliated against the sanctions passed by the League of Nations. In addition to sending notes to the countries participating in the sanctions, attacking the legal basis of the League of Nations' actions, the Italian government has also promulgated a royal decree temporarily suspending trade relations with the countries implementing sanctions and deciding to implement it from November 18, the date the League of Nations' economic war begins. (11th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government has sent a note to the governments of all member states of the League of Nations Adjustment Committee on the sanctions plan, and a copy of the original text has been sent to the governments of other countries for reference. The content is as follows: (1) Italy denies violating Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant, so the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy are not fair. (Article 12 of the Covenant stipulates that if a dispute arises between member states, they may not engage in war until three months after the Executive Council's report, etc.) (2) The people of Abyssinia and the local authorities, as well as religious leaders, are willing to accept Italian protection. After the Italian army occupied the city of Adowa, it ordered the abolition of the slave system in the occupied territories and has fulfilled the obligations of an advanced country. (3) The League of Nations did not notify Italy of the procedures for implementing sanctions under Article 16 of the Covenant. (4) Sanctions will not only endanger the Italian economy, but also seriously affect the world economy. In order to safeguard the survival of its nation, Italy will inevitably take self-defense measures to ensure that the goods needed by the Italian people are not in short supply, and the current relations of international trade must be disintegrated as a result. In short, although the prohibition of the import of all goods from Italy by various countries is an economic measure, it is actually a truly hostile act. Italy has sufficient reason to take retaliatory measures. The League of Nations' move attempts to exclude the 44 million people of Italy from the world market. Once Italy implements retaliation, millions of farmers around the world will be unable to make a living as a result. (5) Although the League of Nations holds an opposing attitude towards Italy, Italy has no intention of withdrawing from the League of Nations in order to avoid causing more serious disputes. The Italian government has taken all measures to prevent the crisis that this situation may cause. "But the member states of the League of Nations are requested to pay attention to the issue of responsibility that may be caused by the implementation of sanctions." Finally, it is said that the Italian government will deal with the coercive measures taken by various countries against Italy calmly. (12th Havas)</p>

<p>(London) Although the Italian government has protested to the governments of the countries participating in the sanctions on the issue of implementing sanctions, according to what our reporter knows, the attitude of the British government has not changed as a result.

<p>(Washington) The Italian Ambassador to the United States, Rosso, spoke with Under Secretary of State Phillips today and handed him a copy of the Italian note to the League of Nations Sanctions Committee. The note requests each country to declare its position on economic sanctions. However, for the United States, it is merely for informational purposes and does not expect a response. Rosso also stated that the note does not mention the US neutrality law or measures taken because of it. Rosso briefly described the contents of the note to reporters, which include the following six points: (1) Italy does not acknowledge violating the League of Nations Covenant and strongly protests the injustice of the sanctions. (2) Italy declares that all events since the last meeting of the League of Nations Council and Assembly have proven Italy's claim that Abyssinia is morally unfit to be a member of the League of Nations. (3) The actions of the Sanctions Committee are illegal because the committee is not a legitimate organization of the League of Nations. (4) The arms embargo on Italy, but not on Abyssinia, has exacerbated the situation in East Africa. (5) Sanctions were not implemented during the conflicts in Daba Valley and Manchuria. (6) Boycotting Italian goods is an act of war, and Italy can take retaliatory action. (National Telegram, November 11)</p>

<p>Wide Range of Goods Included As Retaliation Against Sanctioning Nations</p>
<p>(Rome) Last night, the government ordered the control of foreign imports to retaliate against the countries implementing sanctions against Italy. According to the order's provisions, starting November 18, importers purchasing copper, iron, meat, coffee, grains, cotton, single-wrap silk, hardware, and other various goods from foreign countries must obtain a license from the government. The scope is very broad, almost including all goods. (Reuters dispatch, December 12)</p>
<p>(Rome) The government has just issued an order stipulating that, starting from the 18th of this month (the date when various countries will implement economic sanctions against Italy), anyone importing the following goods into Italy must first obtain government permission and the government will determine the quantity to be imported. These goods are meat, grains, oilseed, oils, fatty foods, woven fabrics, silk fabrics, metal ores, chemical and medical instruments, tanning and dyeing supplies, pigments, rubber, hides, furs, pulp, paper, gramophones, jewelry, gemstones, precious metals, and films. However, currency notes and books are not included. The above measures also apply to the Libyan territories in Africa. In addition, the government has issued an order stipulating that office hours for all agencies will be from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM, with only a half-hour break in the middle, to advance time and save on electricity bills. Finally, the government has another order stipulating that the original tax rate will be maintained for income tax on small amounts of money, but for those with higher incomes, it will be moderately increased starting January 1, 1937.

<h3 id="e38">Luring the Enemy Deep into the Interior Ethiopian Troops Await at Leisure <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Sufficient Ammunition and Provisions Preparing for a Protracted War</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian troops are now asking each other where the Ethiopian troops will make a stand and defend themselves. According to reports from both the northern and southern fronts, the Italian troops' operations are no different from striking air. Although the Italian troops advance quickly, the Ethiopian troops retreat even faster. Whenever the Italian troops enter a town, they find no enemy soldiers. It is generally believed that the Ethiopian troops' strategy is to lure the Italian troops deep into more rugged terrain, lengthen their lines of communication, and then rely on advantageous terrain to await the enemy at leisure and engage with them. Currently, it is believed that the Ethiopian troops on the northern front will persist in resistance south of Ambalagi. Italian aircraft reconnaissance flights have spotted a large army of over 100,000 men gathering in that area. On the southern front, Ethiopian troops are expected to defend along the Qiqiqa to Harar line. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to military experts here, the Ethiopian troops' repeated retreats are motivated by two factors. One is to force Italy to lengthen its lines of communication, and the other is to lure the Italian troops deep into the Ethiopian interior, where the Ethiopian troops have stockpiled large quantities of ammunition and food, making it easy to wage a protracted war against the Italian troops. Ethiopia is currently repairing roads from the western provinces to the Xuya province (northeast of the capital). After the road is repaired, Ethiopian reinforcements from the rear will easily arrive in an endless stream. Conversely, Italian troops advancing from the northern front must simultaneously build roads and establish transportation and rear bases. The reason for the slow progress of the Italian troops in the Tigray province lies in this. It is said that the Ethiopian troops are preparing to confront 220,000 Italian troops in southern Tigray, including 50,000 men led by General Seyoum, 70,000 men led by General Qasa, 50,000 men led by General Yngala, and 70,000 men of the Ethiopian Imperial Guard. All of these troops are equipped with modern weapons and concentrated along the Taquesse River. In addition, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen is stationing another 40,000 men between the city of Taixi and Lake Achanki to resist the advance of the Italian left wing. (Havas dispatch, November 11)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa A clergyman arrived here today from the Tigray region, claiming that the morale of the Ethiopian troops in the Danping area is very high. He also said that although the Italian troops have appointed Qufsa, an Ethiopian leader who surrendered to Italy, as the civil administrator of Magal, the people of Tigray also know that they will never accept Qufsa's rule. According to a dispatch from the southern front, the Italian troops used tear gas in the battle to capture Golahai. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa The Ethiopian government has not issued a formal communique for a long time. According to official sources, General Qasa is currently constructing defenses south of the city of Makale, and it is said that if the Italian troops advance south of Makale, they will encounter countless natural obstacles. The high peak of Mount Hill, the deep valley of the Taquesse River, and the cliffs of Simian are all sufficient to impede the Italian troops' advance. It is also heard that General Seyoum has ordered the execution of twenty Italian spies. (Havas dispatch, November 11)</p>

<p>(Rome) According to military reports from the front, Italian troops have begun to encircle the Tembién area. The troops led by General Maravigna have reached the Atbiyet area and are advancing towards the Taqueza River to prevent General Seyoum's Ethiopian troops from counterattacking Aduwa. Four columns of Italian troops have occupied key military points in the Chagate area. The Italian troops on the Makale front are concentrated in Sherigote. In addition, infantry reconnaissance teams patrol the area day and night to prevent looting by locals. Floodlights are shone from the mountains occupied by the Italian troops at night to facilitate reconnaissance. (Havas dispatch, November 11)</p>
<p>(Rome) Roman newspapers today reported that the Italian troops of Madaha have now advanced to the suburbs of Qiqiqa and are expected to occupy the town tomorrow.

The occupation of Qiqiqa will clear the road to Harar and Dire Dawa. However, it has been learned today that the troops will stop temporarily in Qiqiqa to await the arrival of the main force led by General Graziani. (National Telegram, December 12)</p>

(4) To actively expand armaments, saying that "British defense equipment has many shortcomings, and the government must remedy them. Unexpectedly, there has been a flurry of accusations, pointing to an intention to initiate a new arms race. The voters of the country will certainly not be blinded by such fallacies. I have repeatedly guaranteed that Britain will not establish a large-scale military force. The government's plan is only to reorganize national defense to maintain national security, so that in the event of an accident, the interests of the British mainland and imperial territories can be protected. Apart from this, there is no other thought in mind."

<p>Trade Barriers Are a Cause of International Conflict Aggressive Ambitions Do Not Obstruct Human Progress Treaties Treated as Trifles Where is International Credit?</p>
<p>(Washington) In his Armistice Day speech at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier today, President Roosevelt made an important announcement regarding Britain's world policy. President Roosevelt pointed out that trade barriers are a cause of international conflict and declared that the United States and Canada have effectively agreed to eliminate differences regarding unreasonable trade restrictions. President Roosevelt also solemnly stated that the United States is willing to always seek peaceful means, but must protect itself. The more other countries reduce their armaments, the faster and more firmly the United States will carry out its disarmament. Except for a very small number of people who value private interests over the peace of the nation and the world, the vast majority of the American people unanimously support the government's basic policies in this regard and fully sympathize with other countries' efforts to eliminate war. This is why we have always diligently supported steps to eliminate the causes of war and opposed the aggressive actions taken by other countries. We have used concrete actions and solemn promises to make the United States a good friend. We call the armed aggression and killing acts of people war, and give war a simple definition and reality. We acknowledge that the world's progress has been minimal, which disappoints us. The dangers faced by the entire mankind in the future are greater than those faced by the American people alone. International jealousy still exists, the increase in armaments and the ambitions of countries that disturb the peace have not yet been suppressed, and the most significant crisis is that international trust in the sacred solemnity of international contracts is now weakening. We cannot build walls around ourselves or bury our heads in the sand, we can only move forward with all our strength to seek international peace. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>

<h3 id="e48">US Army Officer Successfully Ascends Stratosphere Achieves Record of 74,000 Feet Above Ground <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Weiner A stratosphere balloon rose to 74,187 feet today, about fifteen miles, breaking the high-altitude record. It landed near the small town of Sticker, eleven miles north of Platt. The metal ship was not shaken when it landed. Explorers Captain Stevens and Anderson completed fifteen kinds of scientific experiments at an altitude of fourteen miles above sea level. The mysterious nature of the stratosphere may be understood more clearly. The balloon landed very quickly. As the sun was setting, the 3.5 million cubic feet of helium slowly leaked out, and the balloon gradually shrank, losing its buoyancy. When the balloon approached the ground, the people in the balloon climbed to the top of the metal ship. Captain Stevens threw a long rope from above and tied it to a tree on the ground. The rope was slowly lowered, and the metal wheel landed safely after two minutes. Four US Army airplanes that followed the balloon also landed at the site a few minutes later. The people in the planes helped the two fold the balloon and sort out the instruments in preparation for transportation. The two were successful and in good spirits. Captain Stevens, who managed the instruments, declared that once the instruments were inspected, it would be known that they had risen to a height of 74,000 feet to 75,000 feet. The landing site was near a highway, and thousands of curious people gathered there in an instant, repeatedly trying to get close to the balloon to find souvenirs, but they were stopped by the air force personnel. The metal ship was made of manganese alloy lighter than aluminum. The shell was only three-sixteenths of an inch thick, but it was extremely hard. The two observed the ascent through many round holes. One hole allowed them to see the shape of the balloon, another hole allowed Anderson to see the ground, and there was another hole under the metal ship, equipped with a large camera, which took pictures every minute and a half. The side of the ship had holes for radio equipment, which the people in the ship used to communicate with the ground. The ship and instruments weighed a total of six tons, and the balloon weighed three tons. (National Telegram, November 11)</p>
<p>Tanchen The two American Army majors, Stevens and Anderson, returned after ascending to a height of 72,000 feet on the world's largest balloon "Explorer II", and landed at White Lake today, 230 miles from Tanchen, breaking the world record for altitude. "Explorer II" took off this morning for stratospheric investigation, spending about eight hours in the sky, taking four hours and twenty-five minutes to ascend and three hours and eight minutes to descend. At 3:20 PM, the balloon sent a radio report that it had reached an altitude of 60,000 feet, and the temperature outside the balloon was 67 degrees below zero. The balloon's goal of 70,000 feet was soon reached, and it continued to ascend for another thousand feet before beginning to descend. When the balloon descended to a thousand feet above the ground, the two explorers climbed to the top of the balloon chamber to prepare for the most important part of the landing. Finally, it landed safely at White Lake. The average descent speed was 400 feet per minute. In addition to the X-ray recorder, the two majors, Shi and An, also used other new photographic and perspective devices to take pictures of the earth at various altitudes. The previous official world altitude record was 61,236.691 feet, set by two American Navy officers, Settle and Fordney, on November 29, 1933. On January 31 of the following year, three Russian pilots reached a height of 67,954 feet, but unfortunately, the balloon chamber fell off during the descent, crashing to the ground, and all the pilots died. Although their results exceeded those of their predecessors, they were not included in the official record. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Guangdong Province Strictly Prohibits the Outflow of Silver <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Additional Restrictions on the Transportation of Silver Coins At the Same Time, the Government Uses Legal Tender to Collect Hard Currency</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication After the promulgation of the currency management laws in Guangdong Province, silver coins in general have lost their circulation effectiveness. In order to prevent the outflow of silver, on the one hand, in accordance with the laws, provincial and municipal silver small denomination notes and silver dollar legal tender are used to purchase silver coins and silver dollar coins at an increased rate (that is, small denomination notes and legal tender of one dollar and two cents are used to purchase one dollar of silver coins, and silver dollar legal tender of one dollar and forty-four cents are used to purchase one silver dollar hard currency), so as to concentrate the silver in the government. On the other hand, strict prevention and precaution are taken against merchants privately transporting silver for export. Regarding the issuance of permits for transporting silver, the Department of Finance has added regulations, which have been submitted to the provincial government for approval and implementation. The following eight temporary measures, which the Department of Finance has added to restrict the transportation of silver coins within the province and the issuance of permits, are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  If merchants in this province transport small denomination silver dollars or silver dollars to areas that have always used small denomination silver dollars or silver dollars, and the vessels carrying them must pass through the ocean for export before re-importing to the destination, or belong to the domestic border, they can leave the country upon arrival. Even if the transporters are not directly smuggling for export, but there is a possibility of circumventing export for profit, in addition to the allowable limit of ten yuan per the silver prohibition rules, if there is more, it will be handled in accordance with the supplementary measures previously ordered by this department to crack down on private transportation of hard currency circumventing export from the inland, and the provisions of these measures.</p>
<p>2.  If there is no situation mentioned in the preceding article (1) for transporting silver coins within the province, these measures do not apply.</p>
<p>3.  If there is a situation mentioned in the preceding article (1) for transporting silver coins within the province, the person should, in accordance with the supplementary measures, find a reputable and well-established guarantee shop in Guangzhou that has obtained a business license to provide a guarantee bond and submit it to the Department of Finance for verification, approval, and issuance of a permit to protect the transport of silver. If the Department of Finance has entrusted the customs supervision office or customs branch to issue transport permits on its behalf, the local area will still handle it in accordance with the case.</p>
<p>4.  Whether silver coins are transported for export or import, they are limited to locations where customs offices are established. No matter which ferry is used to carry the silver coins, it must be listed on the manifest of the ferry for customs inspection and verification.</p>
<p>5.  When declaring for import, the permit should be submitted to the customs for inspection. After the customs has completed the verification, the date of verification and release should be written on the permit, stamped with a seal, and released. After being transported to the destination, the reporting merchant should submit the permit to the original issuing agency for verification and cancellation within the time limit.</p>
<p>6.  Regardless of which agency issues the permit to protect the transport, this department may at any time secretly order officials of the local agency to investigate whether a merchant has transported silver coins to the local area and sold them abroad to smuggle them for export and profit. If there is such a situation, even if the original protection permit has been cancelled, the guarantee shop and the reporting merchant cannot shirk their responsibility.</p>
<p>7.  Wuzhou is an inland commercial port outside this province, but the commercial relationship between Guangdong and Wuzhou is close. These measures specifically treat Wuzhou in the same way as the inland areas of this province. If there is a merchant transporting silver from Guangzhou to Wuzhou, the reason for needing to transport silver should be submitted to this department for the issuance of a permit before transportation can begin.</p>
<p>8.  These measures will be promulgated and implemented by the Department of Finance after being submitted to the provincial government and transferred to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for the customs supervisors and tax commissioners of this province to follow, and the various customs offices will implement them in accordance with the instructions.

<p>— (Lectures to the National Public on October 18th, 21st, 27th, and 28th) Researcher at the Institute of Astronomy, Academia Sinica Chen Zun-Gui</p>
<p>I have now checked that from 1542 AD (the 21st year of the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing reign) to this year, in roughly 400 years, there have been a total of 26 solar eclipses that passed over China. From this year onwards, in 100 years, there will be a total of 10 total solar eclipses visible in China, which can be considered a very plentiful century. However, these solar eclipses may either be too close to dawn, too close to sunset, or too far towards the northern or southern borders. Seeking those whose position is just right to be visible at noon, in the past 400 years there have only been 4, and in the next 100 years, there will only be one, which roughly matches the estimated odds above. If we also require that they pass through densely populated areas along the Yellow River and Yangtze River, and be visible near noon in the central region of the mainland, then in 500 years, there will only be two. One is the total eclipse of August 11, 1542 (the day of Ji You in the seventh month of the 21st year of the Ming Dynasty's Jiajing reign, as recorded in the History of Ming), a noon solar eclipse in the Yellow River basin. The second is the total eclipse of September 21, 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China), a noon solar eclipse in the Yangtze River basin. These two total eclipses are almost exactly four centuries apart. Such an opportunity can truly be considered rare and precious, so our country's astronomers, physicists, and meteorologists have now organized a Solar Eclipse Observation Committee to prepare for the observation activities at that time.</p>
<p>The most recent total solar eclipses visible in our China were originally the two on June 19th of next year and February 5th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943 AD), but the paths of these two are both very far towards the northeastern borders, so the opportunity is not very good. There is also one on May 9th of the 37th year of the Republic of China (1948 AD), although it is from southwest to northeast, most of what will be visible is an annular eclipse, and even if a little total eclipse can be seen, the time will be extremely short.</p>
<p>What I have said above is the situation of solar and lunar eclipses that occur as a result of the movement of the sun and moon. Now we want to talk about the changes of the four seasons.</p>
<p>What are the four seasons? We all know that they are spring, summer, autumn, and winter. We also know that summer is very hot, winter is very cold, and spring and autumn are warm and suitable. So everyone knows that spring, summer, autumn, and winter are related to climate and temperature. But how do spring, summer, autumn, and winter occur? Why do the temperatures of each season change? That is related to the position of the sun, or in other words, it is because the Earth revolves around the sun.</p>
<p>We all know that the Earth is a oblate spheroid shape, and it rotates once every day. Its rotation method is to rotate around a line passing through its center as an axis. For example, if we take a wooden ball and insert a wooden rod through the center of the wooden ball, and we hold both ends of the wooden rod with two hands and rotate it, then the wooden ball will also rotate with it. The Earth's rotation is the same as this style. The line passing through the center of the Earth is called the axis of rotation, and the two ends of the axis of rotation are called the poles. The plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation intersects the Earth's surface to form a large circle, and this large circle is called the Earth's equator. Therefore, we connect the points on the Earth's surface that are equidistant from the two poles, and that is the Earth's equator. For example, the wooden ball mentioned above represents our Earth. We use a pencil to connect all the points on the surface of the ball that are equidistant from the two ends of the rod, and that must be a large circle, and this circle is the equator.</p>
<p>When we stand outside in the yard, we see the sky as if it is a hemispherical shape. All the sun, moon, and stars seem to be on this hemisphere. In reality, this sky is a large sphere centered on where we are standing, with an infinitely large length as its radius. Although we only see half of it, the other half is below our horizon. This large sphere is called the celestial sphere in astronomy. All the movements of the sun, moon, and stars are imagined on top of this celestial sphere. We assume that we extend the Earth's equator outwards, and it must intersect the celestial sphere in a large circle called the celestial equator. We extend the two ends of the Earth's axis of rotation outwards, and it must intersect the celestial sphere at two points, the one in the north is called the north celestial pole, and the one in the south is called the south celestial pole. Near the north celestial pole there is a star that we call the North Star. On a clear night, we stand facing north, first find the location of the Big Dipper. After seeing the Big Dipper, then extend the two stars on the outside of the Dipper towards the mouth of the Dipper, to about five times the distance between these two stars, there is a bright star, and that is the North Star. The north celestial pole is near this star, which is also the direction pointed to by our Earth's axis of rotation.</p>
<p>We already know that the Earth revolves around the sun, but when we look from the Earth, it seems that the sun is the machine that is moving in the sky. The time it takes for our Earth to actually revolve around the sun once is called a year, and the orbit it travels projected onto the celestial sphere is called the ecliptic. Therefore, the ecliptic is the orbit traveled by the sun on the celestial sphere in a year. This ecliptic and the equator are not the same, the angle at which they intersect is twenty-three and a half degrees. Because these two large circles—the equator is a large circle, and the ecliptic is also a large circle—are not the same, they intersect at two points, and these two points are called the equinoxes, which are the vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox.</p>
<p>Since the ecliptic and the equator are not on the same plane, the ecliptic is divided into two parts by the equator, one part is to the north of the equator, and one part is to the south of the equator. We know that the sun travels on the ecliptic, so every year the sun enters and exits the north and south of the equator, that is, it travels from the north side of the equator to the south side of the equator, and then travels from the south side to the north side of the equator, once a year. Therefore, there are two dates each year when the sun is above the equator, which are the dates when it passes through the two equinoxes. One is around March 21st each year, when the sun travels from the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere, and the point it passes is called the vernal equinox, and this time is called the vernal equinox. The other is around September 23rd each year, when the sun travels from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere, and the point it passes is called the autumnal equinox, and this time is called the autumnal equinox. Also, the lowest point on the ecliptic south of the equator is called the winter solstice point, and the time when the sun is at this point is called the winter solstice. The highest point on the ecliptic north of the equator is called the summer solstice point, and the time when the sun is at this point is called the summer solstice.</p>
<p>As for the direction of sunrise and sunset, it is also different in the four seasons. In the case of China, during the vernal equinox and autumnal equinox, the sun rises from due east and sets in due west. The path traveled by the sun in one day, half is above the horizon and half is below the horizon, so day and night are equal, that is, daytime and nighttime are the same length. At the summer solstice, the sun is in the far north, rising from the northeast direction and setting in the northwest. The path traveled by the sun on the horizon is larger than a semicircle, so the daytime is the longest and the nighttime is the shortest. At the winter solstice, the sun is in the far south, rising from the southeast direction and setting in the southwest. The path traveled by the sun above the horizon is smaller than a semicircle, so the daytime is the shortest and the nighttime is the longest.</p>
<p>The sun travels eastward along the ecliptic from around March 21st of this year, after passing the vernal equinox point, until around March 21st of next year when it passes the vernal equinox point again, which is one year. In this year, the sun travels one circle on the ecliptic, a total of 360 degrees; the four points mentioned above, the vernal equinox, summer solstice, autumnal equinox, and winter solstice, are exactly 90 degrees apart from each other. Then divide 90 degrees into six equal parts, with 15 degrees as one segment, for a total of twenty-four solar terms. Their order, starting from the vernal equinox, is the vernal equinox, Qingming (Pure Brightness), Guyu (Grain Rain), Lixia (Start of Summer), Xiaoman (Grain Full), Mangzhong (Grain in Ear), summer solstice, Xiaoshu (Minor Heat), Dashu (Major Heat), Liqiu (Start of Autumn), Chushu (End of Heat), Bailu (White Dew), autumnal equinox, Hanlu (Cold Dew), Shuangjiang (Frost's Descent), Lidong (Start of Winter), Xiaoxue (Minor Snow), Daxue (Major Snow), winter solstice, Xiaohan (Minor Cold), Dahan (Major Cold), Lichun (Start of Spring), Yushui (Rain Water), Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects). The source of these twenty-four solar terms, according to the solar terms mentioned above, is completely based on the position of the sun, so many people think that the solar terms are the benefit of the solar calendar, which is really ridiculous. Regarding this issue, I will talk about it next time when I talk about "the benefits of the National Calendar". As for the division of the four seasons, some are divided according to the solar terms, and some are divided according to the climate. His decree can be divided into three types</p>
<p>First, the division method that we have always used in China is</p>
<p>Spring: With the vernal equinox as the center, that is, from Lichun (around February 4th) to Lixia (around May 5th or 6th), a total of ninety days and eighteen hours.</p>
<p>Summer: With the summer solstice as the center, that is, from Lixia to Liqiu (around August 7th or 8th), a total of ninety-four days and one hour.</p>
<p>Autumn: With the autumnal equinox as the center, that is, from Liqiu to Lidong (around November 7th), a total of ninety-one days and twenty hours.</p>
<p>Winter: With the winter solstice as the center, that is, from Lidong to Lichun, a total of eighty-eight days and fifteen hours.</p>
<p>That is, we Chinese use the four "Li" (establishment) characters as the beginning of the four seasons, that is, Lichun is the beginning of spring, Lixia is the beginning of summer. Our Chinese lunar calendar stipulates that the first, second, and third months are the spring season. However, the number of days in each month is determined by the new moon and full moon, and the number of months is determined according to the position of the sun, so the first day of the first month is not necessarily Lichun. Lichun is often around fourteen and a half days before or after the first day of the first month, so Lichun is sometimes at the end of the previous year, but the average over a long period is probably around the ninth day of the first month.</p>
<p>Second, the division method of Western countries is</p>
<p>Spring: From the vernal equinox (around March 21st or 22nd) to the summer solstice (around June 22nd or 23rd), a total of ninety-two days and twenty hours.</p>
<p>Summer: From the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox (around September 22nd or 23rd), a total of ninety-three days and fourteen hours.</p>
<p>Autumn: From the autumnal equinox to the winter solstice (around December 21st or 22nd), a total of eighty-nine days and nineteen hours.</p>
<p>Winter: From the winter solstice to the vernal equinox, a total of eighty-nine days and one hour. The above division method is commonly called the astronomers' division method. It is called spring from the date of equal day and night in late March to the date of the longest day. From the end of spring to the date of equal day and night in September, it is called summer, from the end of summer to the date of the shortest day it is called autumn, from the end of autumn to the date of equal day and night next year, it is called winter</p>
<p>Third, the division of the weather fruit. is</p>
<p>Spring: March, April, May, three months, a total of ninety-two days</p>
<p>Summer: June, July, August, three months, a total of ninety-two days</p>
<p>Autumn: September, October, November, three months, a total of ninety-one days</p>
<p>Winter:, December, January, February, three months, a total of ninety days or ninety-one days</p>

<p>Bank-issued banknotes guaranteed by real estate, with denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan, total about 1.3 million yuan in circulation in the market. (3) After the bank's closure, the unrecovered guaranteed banknotes are circulated with the Chamber of Commerce's seal, called circulating notes, with about 600,000 yuan still in the market. In addition, there are temporary white paper subsidiary currency notes issued for year-end turnover (i.e., day exchange orders, with face values of 50 yuan and 100 yuan), which were originally limited to short-term circulation and were to be recovered within the period, but in fact, various stores have formed long-term use due to credit or business relationships, in order to facilitate mutual assistance and settlement among peers. In addition, various reputable stores in Chao'an, Chenghai, Jieyang, Puning, and Chaoyang counties, such as those that have obtained the status of gentry from district and township chiefs, also print and issue silver dollar and copper cash notes, with denominations of 50 cents, 100 cents, 5 dimes, and 10 dimes, which are entrusted to collection and exchange shops in Shantou for cash redemption, so they can also circulate. The total number cannot be investigated, because there are many shops and numbers in each county, and the printing and issuance are not subject to government inspection, nor is there a board of directors to protect them. With such a chaotic and complex situation, the intangible losses of the people cannot be quantified.</p>
<p>The Shantou branch of the Provincial Bank is a sub-treasury for collecting provincial and national taxes. The monthly tax revenue from Chaozhou and Meizhou submitted to the bank is no less than 2 million yuan. With sufficient capital and good credit, it issues 5-dime, 1-yuan, 5-yuan, and 10-yuan silver dollar notes, totaling about 800,000 yuan. Also, because Shantou markets circulate silver dollars, it separately issues 300,000 yuan of silver dollar notes. The banknotes issued by the Shantou Provincial Bank are printed with the words "Shantou", and the style is the same as the banknotes of the Guangzhou head office, but the price is different. In previous political upheavals and rumors in Guangdong Province, the price of Provincial Bank banknotes fluctuated, but the price of the banknotes of the Shantou branch has always been stable and has not deviated from the standard, because silver dollars and silver dimes are not as convenient as Provincial Bank banknotes for carrying, settlement, and paying taxes. Moreover, Provincial Bank banknotes must first be exchanged for silver dimes at exchange shops and require a premium to be used in Shantou, because the banknotes of the head office cannot be directly circulated and used in Chaoshan, which is the difference. Before the Ministry of Finance's order on nationalization of silver reached Shantou, the Shantou branch of the Provincial Bank actually held the highest authority in the city's financial circles. As for the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and the two banks, there are no branches in Chaoshan. The Shantou branch of the Bank of China only operates domestic and foreign exchange, savings, etc., and collects taxes on behalf of the Chaozhou Customs. Banknotes from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are very rare in Chaoshan. Someone remits money from Shanghai to Shantou through the Bank of China, and a 35-yuan remittance note only receives about 32 yuan in Shantou. The exchange rate and silver price are so far apart. If legal tender is brought from Shanghai to Shantou for use, it must first be exploited by the exchange shops, and it will probably only get 92%. This can also be seen as the currency situation in Chaoshan in the past.</p>
<p>On the 7th of this month, the Finance Department promulgated the order on nationalization of silver to Shantou, and the method is the same as that promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, but the Bank of China collects Chaozhou Customs taxes using the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications banknotes as the standard, and the Shantou branch of the Provincial Bank collects various taxes using the Provincial Bank banknotes as the standard, and the Provincial Bank banknotes use the Shantou local name notes as the standard, so there are in effect two countries' legal tender in Chaoshan markets. The financial situation in Chaoshan still feels chaotic, and due to the major financial turbulence in recent days, prices have soared, and the people are also very distressed.</p>

<p>Provincial Committee Investigates Red Pill Offenders</p>
<p>According to reports from Provincial Anti-Smoking Investigator Zhou Weinong, someone was selling red pills in the 25th Tu of Chedun Village. On the 11th, he went with the Farmers' Association and County Government investigators Wang Yueliang and others. They found two pounds of red pills and smoking paraphernalia in the home of Yao Jinyun, a former local security officer, and arrested him for handling by the County Government.</p>

<p>Fundraising to Open a County Hospital</p>
<p>The County Government is preparing to establish a county hospital and has already established a preparatory committee. It was resolved to raise 20,000 yuan for construction costs, 10,000 yuan for start-up costs, and 30,000 yuan for a fund in teams. County Magistrate Xu was appointed as the overall captain, and Huang Yusun and Pan Zhiren as deputy overall captains. Zhu Yinjiang, Yang Weiyu, Gu Weijun, Tong Shiheng, Qin Jingyang, Chen Xingzhang, Pan Yangyao, Wu Yunshun, Chen Bangxing, Wu Huanru, Xu Xiangsun, Gu Jisheng and other twenty-four people were appointed as captains and proceeded immediately. The hospital site was decided next to the Kuishan Park, and the land was donated by Dr. Ge Chenghui.</p>

<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Harassing Everywhere</p>
<p>In the Zhongzhuang Township of the First District, more than 200 guest籍 refugees arrived on the day of Er. They stayed in the Huangchi Temple that night. The next morning, they went to the Shenjiawan area to rope in rice and other grains, and robbed the house of Baozhang (Neighborhood chief) Chen Dingxing, where they were robbed of three fur coats. In the afternoon, the refugees robbed the Lin family at Xiaoqiaotou, and the losses were uncountable. In the Houzhai Town area of the Eighth District, more than 380 refugees arrived, speaking with a Hunan accent. The Second Sub-Station of the town's Public Security Bureau dispatched police to suppress them and force them out of the border, heading towards Suzhou.</p>
<p>Nantong</p>
<p>Burning Cotton Stalks to Eliminate Pests</p>
<p>In recent years, the counties under the jurisdiction of Jiangbei Tong and the coastal reclamation areas have suffered from insect pests, and production has decreased. According to research by cotton pest experts, the nests of these pests for overwintering are mostly lurking in cotton stalks, dead leaves, or fruit bolls, and only become active in March and April of the following spring. The villagers use cotton stalks as fuel and are unwilling to burn them in the fields, which is against the prestige of insect pests. They are encouraging the villagers to burn the cotton stalks beforehand and limit all states to be burned before Qingming next year. Special orders were issued to each county to make use of Baojia to implement it effectively.</p>
<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Villagers from Three Counties Sue Each Other Over a Judgment</p>
<p>The villagers from the same township in Zhenjiangyi three counties previously sued because Xiao Wensun and Zhang Dongchen, from the same township in Yangzhou, dismantled the Nanmu Hall wood of the Hubei Guild Hall and transported it to Jin Da Wood Company outside Fuyunmen for sale. This was discovered by fellow villager Dan Gongjin, who reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which ordered the first sub-station to send police to stop it. At the same time, brick lawyer Fang Ren wrote a complaint to the court, requesting the restoration of the original state. After several trials by Judge Zhou of the Civil Court, a judgment was pronounced a few days ago. The main text said that the Wang Bucheng and others' resolution on February 19 of this year was confirmed to be invalid. The defendants Xiao Wensun and Zhang Dongchen should restore the dismantled part of the Nanmu Hall of the Hubei Guild Hall to its original state, and the rest of the plaintiff's claims were rejected. The litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant.</p>

<p>Livelihoods of Salt Farmers Amidst the Salt Tide</p>
<p>The Yuyao salt field is the best in Zhejiang, producing a large amount of salt. It has a salt factory that specializes in buying and selling salt and selling it to various provinces. The business has always been known to be developed. Since the beginning of this year, the salt works have been piling up with stock, losing money for years, and not accepting new goods. Therefore, the livelihoods of 100,000 salt farmers have been cut off. If they sell smuggled goods, there are prohibitions in the law, and the salt farmers dare not try it lightly, resulting in the sale of wives and children, which is often heard. There are several suicides and starvation deaths a day. In this situation, the salt farmers were forced to gather in groups and ask the salt works to open scales and accept salt several times to maintain their livelihoods. However, the manager of the salt works had already fled, and no one was responsible, so there was no answer. Fortunately, Salt Transport Envoy Zhou Zonghua saw the seriousness of the situation, so he convened a meeting of salt merchants. As a result, the salt works were notified to collect salt at 60% of the reported amount, but the salt farmers felt that it was still difficult to maintain their livelihoods and could not be satisfied. Later, after strenuous persuasion, some who were forced into poverty only sold it painfully, and there were still some who sat and waited for death. I don't know how many there are, it is said.</p>

<p>Security Forces Rescue Hostages</p>
<p>The Security Corps of Zhaitou, the third district of Yuhuan, received a tip-off on the afternoon of the 7th of this month that two hostages were hidden in the Sutou Suyan Cave in the local mountains. Squad Leader Fu immediately led the troops to search. Halfway there, they suddenly met a child who asked if the hostage Sun Renzhou, 14 years old, from the Chetou of Yueqing Baixiang, and his classmate Huang Lihua, (11 years old) were sleeping in the cave. They took the opportunity to escape while the bandits were drinking and hadn't returned. He was young and unable to walk, crying and lost. He thought that he was still in the hands of thieves. There were more than ten other classmates. Because the bandits were inconvenient to carry due to the strict pursuit of the military and police, they were all pushed into the sea by the bandits and drowned, which is pitiful. Squad Leader Fu wrote a detailed document based on the situation and sent it to the Chuli Corps headquarters in person, and telegraphed to Yueqing County Magistrate Zhang to inform the family members to come and claim them.</p>

<p>— Jiyuan</p>
<p>Various Aspects of Chongqing (Part 1)</p>
<p>Chongqing is located between the Yangtze River and the Jialing River, the entire city forming a peninsula. Houses are built against the mountains, varying in height. Geographically speaking, it is quite similar to Los Angeles in the United States and Hong Kong in southern China. However, in terms of the narrowness of the streets and the disorder on the streets, it is far inferior. According to recent statistics, the city has a population of over 300,000, and including Jiangbei and Ba County, about 800,000, making it the largest commercial port in Sichuan and a strategic barrier for both northwestern and southwestern China. Except for a portion of goods from Lower Eastern Sichuan that are distributed from Wanxian, most of Sichuan's import and export trade must pass through Chongqing as a transportation hub. The import and export goods of provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Shaanxi, and Gansu are also mostly transshipped here.</p>
<p>Due to its strategic location, as early as the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign in the Qing Dynasty, Britain coveted it and designated Chongqing as a commercial port in the Sino-British Beijing Supplementary Treaty. To this day, various countries' consulates stand in Consulate Lane, their gates half-closed, and the courtyards inside are quiet and secluded, making people feel even more strongly the "open door of the Yangtze River." Since the beginning of the Republic of China, almost all of the more than 470 large and small civil wars in Sichuan Province have centered on the struggle for Chengdu and Chongqing. The importance of Chongqing's position is no less than that of Chengdu.</p>
<p>Since the Central Army entered Sichuan this spring, Chongqing's position has become even more important. Transportation construction has taken Chongqing as its hub, and the economic development of Sichuan will also take Chongqing as its starting point. Recently, the provisional headquarters moved to Chongqing, and the Wuchang provisional headquarters also merged with the Chongqing provisional headquarters. As a result, Chongqing has become the center of national military command. During my stay in Chongqing this time, I spent ten days and saw that the various situations in Chongqing were quite different from those in the downstream ports. I will briefly describe my feelings as follows: 1. Developed Banks and Bankrupt Qianzhuang: Banks were established in Chongqing in the late Qing Dynasty, and after 1930, banking business developed even more rapidly. Although the chaos of Sichuan's finances and the complexity of the monetary system hindered the development of banking business to some extent, banks still showed a growing trend in this state of being riddled with problems. There are two main reasons for this: (1) The continuous collapse of the countryside led to the concentration of bureaucratic and merchant capital in banks; (2) Banks were more convenient than qianzhuang in operating in Shanghai exchange speculation, government bond trading, and interest rate and ocean freight business. For these reasons, except for two or three banks in Chongqing that lost money due to reckless speculation in Shanghai exchange, the rest made huge profits last year. There are now more than a dozen large and small banks in Chongqing, and the branch banks set up by various banks in Chongqing are said to be not included in this number. As for qianzhuang, they have been suppressed by banks, their business is sluggish, and the number has decreased from fifty or sixty to ten or twenty, and there are still more going bankrupt. Since the central government announced the order to recover local banknotes at 80% of their value, a small wave has been stirred up in Chongqing's financial circles. The monetary base has not yet been fully stabilized, and commercial transactions mostly use checks or account transfers. Recently, due to the insufficient supply of central banknotes, there is a 20% discount for exchanging checks for central banknotes, which has caused another disturbance in Chongqing's financial circles, but it does not seem to have much impact on banking business. Recently, the American-Feng Bank in Chongqing has expanded its business, and there is news that the New Industry Bank (formerly an opium industry bank) is being revived. Influenced by Shanghai banks' investment in rural areas, various banks seem to be focusing on rural Sichuan, and as a result, a large number of farmers' banks have been newly established in various counties.</p>
<p>2. Commercial Appearance Still Prosperous: Chongqing's commerce can be roughly divided into categories such as silk, cloth, mountain goods, medicinal materials, salt, sugar, Soviet goods, hardware, cotton yarn, rice, tung oil, tobacco, and shipping. In the past year, the local production of salt and sugar has been sluggish due to the encroachment of foreign goods and the restrictions of taxes and levies. Other grain industries have been profitable due to Shanghai exchange relations or thriving trade. The situation this year is roughly the same as in previous years. Various imported goods are extremely crowded, and the freight rates for upstream ships have risen sharply. Conversely, due to the narrow sales market, the quantity of exported goods is gradually decreasing, but the export of tung oil is still good. According to Mr. Zhou, the manager of the Bank of China, "Oil is a major import, about 8,000 boxes per year. In total, the province's annual trade deficit is about 20 million yuan or more. There is no way to remedy exports, and imports are coming in steadily. If this continues, the situation is very worrying." His words expressed deep emotion. According to my investigation, the Chongqing market is flooded with foreign goods, especially Japanese goods, and the business of various foreign goods stores seems to be particularly developed recently. The wealthy sons and daughters of Chongqing generally like fashion and are good at imitation, specializing in consumption work for foreign merchants. Therefore, the more the city develops, the more the power of foreign merchants increases. The convenience of transportation has created a good opportunity to promote foreign goods, which is quite heartbreaking. Mr. Zhou continued, "Although there is no way to actively increase revenue at present, we should try our best to reduce expenditure. Sichuan has oil everywhere, and Sichuan also has production of cement, gypsum, copper, iron, etc. The raw materials for woolen fabrics are abundant in western and northwestern Sichuan. If raw materials can be fully utilized, outflow can be suppressed and all industries can be developed. The biggest pain in Sichuan now is that there are raw materials but no means of production. How to develop production is the most urgent task."</p>
<p>3. Middlemen Classes Are Quite Overbearing: The middleman class refers to the so-called middlemen, who rely solely on extracting commissions from hard labor for a living. This kind of people occupies a considerable force in Chongqing. Their exploitation of general workers can be described as meticulous. For example, among the organizations of boatmen on ships, rickshaw pullers, wooden boats (small sailboats that Sichuanese call wooden boats), sedan chair carriers (simpler sedan chairs), and dock porters (all manipulated by middlemen), it is not easy for general workers to find work without going through middlemen. And general middlemen often attract many unemployed farmers to flock to the cities in order to exploit them further. The life of general workers is unspeakably miserable. Taking rickshaws as an example, before the Communist bandits fled, the daily rickshaw rent was about 13 diao (each diao is equivalent to more than four cents of silver yuan), plus commission. After paying the rent, the rickshaw pullers had little left, and some even did not earn enough to pay the rent. Later, due to the growing Communist disaster, the municipal authorities reduced the rickshaw rent from 13 diao to 5 diao. It is heard that the Chongqing municipal government is also paying attention to this and will strictly limit this kind of evil habit of extracting labor. If it can be thoroughly handled, the labor community will benefit greatly.</p>

<p>He also walks to the pen,</p>
<p>To take a look at his ox;</p>
<p>Turns his head and says to her;</p>
<p>"How is it—</p>
<p>Our newly brewed wine?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>——Liu Bannong, "The Evening of a Small Farming Family"——</p>
<p>In the eyes of poets, the countryside is such a beautiful and fascinating picture! Similarly, when Mr. Yu Dafu toured the famous scenic spots of Zhejiang Province, he also had a short poem describing the scenery of the mountain village. I don't remember the original poem very well, but it seems that the last two sentences were "Children go to pick tea in pairs, and idle away before the bucket with a tree of flowers!" In the poet's pen, the lonely and desolate countryside has become a peaceful world that "is not surprised by knives or soap."</p>
<p>However, we don't have to go to the collection of so-called pastoral poets to find materials. We have to observe and find problems from the real lives of farmers. It turns out that the so-called "poets" are used to using their own joys and sorrows to "illuminate" everything. Below, I will briefly talk about what I have seen about the lives of farmers in the countryside in the past two years.</p>
<p>2. The Farmers I Saw</p>
<p>Here, I can tell the reader a few facts about the countryside:</p>
<p>Once, a simple clinic we ran came to a farmer in her fifties who wanted treatment for her son, who had been suffering from malaria for two years. After she found out that she had to take quinine, she wanted a packet: as usual, she had to be charged six copper coins—because there are many addicts locally, and it costs more than ten yuan a month to cope, so she had to charge a fee—she dug around in her chest for a long time, and unexpectedly dug out an egg. It turned out that the only thing her family could exchange was this only egg! And the one laid yesterday had already been exchanged for kerosene at the grocery store!</p>
<p>I remember when I was at home, I always bought straw in loads of two loads. I have never seen a farmer in the market bringing a bundle of straw to sell, but one day a farmer actually brought a bundle of straw to sell. When asked why he only brought one bundle, his answer was really out of my expectation. "Today, × village pays homage to the gods, and a few copper coins are enough to buy incense and candles." It turns out that the countryside does not need currency much. The flour they eat is just exchanged for wheat—one liter for one liter, which is very fair.</p>
<p>Coming back from the city, when walking through a certain village lane, I often see two or three farmers surrounding a small square stool for meals. I have a little nearsightedness, and at first I didn't pay attention to what they were eating. I thought it was probably nothing more than tofu, pickles, salted fish, and white rice, and they would never get fresh fish and meat. But once I had a whim, and when they were eating, I walked over to take a look, and it shocked me: although I wouldn't mistake wheat for chives, I had never seen what they were eating, of course it was not rice, nor was it porridge, it looked like rice noodles, and like paste. The dishes were just a bowl of broad beans boiled in salt water. It is said that because salt is expensive, there is not much pickled vegetables to eat.</p>
<p>In summer, a rickety old man brought a fourteen or fifteen-year-old child to see a doctor. The old man sat down and was still panting, and the child suddenly fainted! In a hurry, I quickly gave him ammonia to smell, and he slowly woke up. I asked and learned that he had gotten up early today to help his father carry a load of vegetables to the village to sell. He was hungry and wanted to buy two copper coins worth of sweet potatoes, but he had no money. He was sick, walked five or six miles on an empty stomach, and carried vegetables, so naturally he couldn't hold on!</p>
<p>Universal poverty, universally struggling on the line of death! However, these are just the surface appearances in the eyes of outsiders, and they are still just superficial. To know what kind of life they—the farmers—are actually living, it is best to listen to their own complaints. 3. Farmers' Own Words</p>
<p>They were originally "planting fields to eat," but now they universally feel that "there is no benefit in planting fields, and there is no food to eat without planting."</p>
<p>They are most afraid of famine years. A graduate of the senior class of a people's school once wrote such a poem:</p>
<p>"The year is barren, no food to eat!</p>
<p>Sell the old ox, exchange for rice grains.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, rice seedlings have to be planted and the soil turned,</p>
<p>Without the old ox, only the plow is left!"</p>
<p>The person who wrote this song is a diligent young farmer, and he is only about twenty years old this year. I believe that when he wrote it, he must have been holding back tears!</p>
<p>But there are even worse things than famine years! Last year's drought caused many farmland to have no harvest. The number of mu of barren land exempted from grain is determined by the government, but farmers cannot enjoy the right to exempt from grain. There is a saying in the countryside called "Barren Years Familiar Books." It turns out that when there is a disaster, there is always land that is exempted from grain. The lower-level clerks who collect grain taxes can fraudulently report barren land as fertile land. Those who plant their own land pay to buy a "barren certificate" to be exempt from grain, and those who plant rented land buy a barren certificate to be exempt from rent; who cares if there is a harvest in your field! Below is a page from the diary of Yu Hongshan, a member of the cooperative: "This morning, I met a worried-looking person, staring blankly at the head of the field. I asked him, and he said, "My family has eight people, planting five mu of land. Unfortunately, this year there was a drought and insect damage, and there was no harvest! Now, not only is there no food or clothing, but there is no way to pay the barren land fee. Without a barren certificate, I have to pay the rent rice, and it seems that there is only one way to die!" I said, "Recently, a notice was posted at the entrance of the ×× township office, stating that all completely barren land can be exempted from grain, and barren land officials are not allowed to charge a single penny. Why are you charging money now?" "Ah, don't say a notice, even if you post a hundred notices, it's useless... They are all in the same gang. At first, the grain clerk and the district clerk took the lead in collecting the fee, charging four corners per mu of barren land before issuing a barren certificate. Later, the chief of the village saw that they were jealous and said to everyone: The grain clerk and the district clerk privately made barren certificates, which are completely invalid and must be issued by the township office to be effective. After that, it was collected by the township office. However, Mr. × said that it was too unpleasant for the township office to collect barren land fees. Therefore, it was moved to ××li to collect. The district clerk got 50 yuan alone, and the rest was divided equally into five shares: the grain clerk, the southern village chief, the northern village chief, the relief association, and the township deputy each got a share. However, those who are barren are really suffering, where can they get the money to get a barren certificate?"</p>
<p>After listening, I couldn't help but stare blankly at the head of the field.</p>
<p>"What if there is no disaster?"</p>
<p>Good harvest, good harvest!</p>
<p>This year I will harvest a few more loads of rice than last year.</p>
<p>Mom laughs haha, little sister jumps with both feet;</p>
<p>'I'm going to make me a new cotton-padded jacket this year.'</p>
<p>'Okay, okay, okay!' A burst of laughter!</p>
<p>Good harvest, good harvest!</p>
<p>The price of rice is really bad, not as high as last year;</p>
<p>The old rent cannot be paid, how dare you delay the cotton-padded jacket?</p>
<p>Winter is coming, winter is coming! Little sister is freezing and crying."</p>
<p>Zhou Shenqing (Graduate of the Senior Class of a People's School)</p>
<p>Now, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are strictly pursuing old debts of grain tax, aren't they? Grain tax is the main income of the national treasury, and the people have the obligation to pay taxes: if there is a disaster, it can be generously exempted, and if there are old debts, of course, they must be "strictly recovered." But we have to ask, who owes the grain tax? To answer bluntly, all self-cultivating farmers or semi-self-cultivating farmers who go to the fields barefoot have not owed the government half a copper coin! On the contrary, the amount they pay each year exceeds more than double the amount they should pay on the string ticket! Farmers cannot pay grain directly to the grain counter, they can only let the "village chiefs" and local bullies pay on their behalf, and extort money from it. Let's look at the diary of Jin Yun, a student of the People's School:</p>
<p>"A slight breeze brought the sound of coughing, it turned out that Uncle × was also resting under the tree. He continued: "The day before yesterday was the deadline for paying the grain tax from last year. I pawned more than five yuan for the pawn in the bride's room, especially to rush to the city to pay, but I didn't know that the gentleman at the counter checked and said that it had already been paid. As soon as I heard this, I knew that the village chief who paid the grain tax had taken a fancy to me, and I couldn't escape the money! So I went hungry and hurried back to the countryside, and found × village chief in the teahouse in West Street. I said with a smile: Thank you, sir, for paying my grain tax for me, please calculate how much it is? He slowly took out the string ticket and looked at it and said.. According to the string, it costs eleven yuan to pay, plus one yuan for my expenses, a total of twelve yuan. Oh! Old nephew! I should only pay five yuan and forty-five cents, he wants me to pay twelve yuan... more than five yuan, or the pawn in the bride's tears... where is there another six or seven yuan?... Later I said a lot of pleading words to him, but it was still useless. Yesterday I borrowed seven yuan from ×× at a monthly interest rate of five points before it was settled!... Talking about the truth, the old man lowered his head and choked up! I couldn't bear to listen any longer, so I advised him not to cry and go to pick river mud together. I thought that the village chief who eats five liters of rice per mu of farmland from the farmers should always show compassion for our poor people. Who knows that he colluded with the township chief and did all kinds of evil, and even took the opportunity to extort money on the national grain tax. With such insatiable greed, even if we shed all our sweat and blood, working like cattle and horses all year round, we still can't afford to support them...!'"</p>
<p>The "net of heaven and earth" woven by floods, droughts, local bullies, and police officers has tied the farmers so that they cannot move. Their hard work all year round cannot even afford them a full meal. But if they don't plant fields, what else can they do? No wonder they want to make unjust complaints:</p>
<p>"Farmers are busy, farmers are busy,</p>
<p>Farmers are really busy!</p>
<p>The millet is old, harvest the rice;</p>
<p>The rice is on the threshing ground, plant the wheat;</p>
<p>Plant good wheat, grind and thresh;</p>
<p>Grind good threshing, white rice is given to the rich!</p>
<p>Busy all year round,</p>
<p>Hungry and cold!"</p>
<p>—Hua Yimin (Graduate of the Senior Class of a People's School)—</p>
<p>Describing the countryside as a paradise where people are idle is of course a poet's illusion; we can join the farmers' team, or we can recognize a part of their lives; but it is always better to ask them to tell us themselves to be more real and kind! There is a saying: "If the morning man does not plant fields, the city god will cut off the fire, if the farmer does not read books, there is no place to complain." How to make the farmers cry out their own pain?</p>

<h3 id="e55">Various Circles in Shanghai Held a Memorial Meeting for the Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birthday Yesterday <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>More than 300 representatives attended the Municipal People's Education Center. All agencies, etc., flew flags and closed for the holiday. Military police were on alert.</p>
<p>November 12 is the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang. The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters convened representatives from all walks of life at the Municipal People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road at 10:00 a.m. to hold a memorial meeting for the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's birth. The Chairman of the Municipal Committee, Huang Zaoxiong, reported on the significance of the memorial, and Cai Bubai, the representative of the Municipal Anti-Smoking Committee, delivered a speech. All agencies, schools, and factories in the city were closed for one day, and all circles flew flags to celebrate. The military and police authorities were also on strict alert. The situation of the memorial meeting is recorded in detail below.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Those who attended the memorial meeting included Huang Zaoxiong of the Municipal Committee, Shi Weijun of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Tan Gengxin of the Audit Office, the Shanghai South Office of the Health Bureau, Qi Shugong, Li Yuanfu of the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Association, Zhu Shengying of the Air Defense Association, Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Shi Yuemen of the Jiangxi Fellow Association in Shanghai, Hu Tianseng of the New Movement Association, Yu Yaoqiu of the Baoshan Fellow Association, Cen Chiyao of the Shipping Industry Association, Chang Daotong of the French Concession Taxpayer Association, Hong Hao of the Poor Children's Education Institute, Cai Bubai of the Anti-Smoking Committee, Zhu Zongjian of the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, Wu Ding of the Gao Er Branch, Lin Kecong of the Women's Association, Lou Zhaoding of the Navigation Administration, staff members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, representatives of various schools, groups, and party headquarters at all levels, and others, totaling more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the Chairman, Huang Zaoxiong, reported that the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen of our party marked the beginning of a new life for the Chinese nation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen created the great Three Principles of the People in his doctrine and organized the revolutionary Kuomintang in his career, enabling the Chinese nation to break away from the shackles of autocracy and embark on the open road of freedom and equality. Therefore, when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in addition to expressing our admiration for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's great revolutionary cause, we should also earnestly abide by and strive for the teachings that Dr. Sun Yat-sen left us. Among Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, the most unforgettable for us are "peace," "struggle," and "saving China." Because to unite domestically, strengthen national power, obtain freedom and equality from our own national status, and then achieve the goal of world harmony, we must start with "peace." Because to advance all undertakings in China and overcome all difficulties, we must also struggle. Being able to "peace" and being able to "struggle" can "save China." Furthermore, the fearless spirit shown in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong career should be emulated even more when the national crisis is becoming increasingly serious today. These are a few things I wanted to say today. Over.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Cai Bubai, the representative of the Anti-Smoking Committee, delivered a speech, stating briefly that today I would like to take this opportunity to report to you on some matters related to anti-smoking. The degree to which the prevalence of opium in China harms the country and the nation is already clear to everyone. But why does opium have such a deep-rooted force in China? After so many anti-smoking campaigns, why hasn't there been a very good result? It can be roughly divided into three reasons: (1) The reason of national character, because of the laziness and conservatism of the Chinese nation, an inextricable relationship occurred after opium was imported; (2) The reason of politics, because of the restrictions of unequal treaties and the desire of warlords and corrupt officials to seek personal gain, opium was able to circulate freely in the country; (3) The reason of society, because general traitors tried to make huge profits and the environment was bad, causing the spread of opium. We must start from three aspects in the future to carry out anti-smoking: (1) Sanctions by public opinion; (2) Sanctions by politics; (3) Improving the environment. Now the government has made the greatest determination to strictly prohibit opium. I hope that all of you present can assist the government in implementing the anti-smoking policy.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans</p>
<p>(1) To commemorate the leader, we must eliminate the Red bandits and appease the refugees. (2) Work hard and implement the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress. (3) Gather the will of the entire party and strengthen the power of the country. (4) Unite sincerely and support the Fifth National Congress. (5) The anniversary of the leader's birth is the memorial day for the development of a new life for the Chinese nation. (6) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. (7) Long live the Three Principles of the People. (8) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Memorial</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 12th) was the anniversary of the leader's birth. All the staff of the municipal government gathered in the auditorium of the municipal central district at 10:00 a.m. to hold a memorial ceremony. Because Mayor Wu went to Beijing to attend a meeting, Secretary-General Yu presided over the meeting and led the ceremony. He then reported on the significance of the memorial and encouraged his colleagues to continue the leader's legacy, work together with one heart and one mind, and complete the leader's great revolutionary cause, etc.</p>
<p>Memorial by Party Headquarters on Both Railways</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 70th anniversary of the leader's birth. The Special Party Headquarters of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways held a memorial meeting at the headquarters. More than 100 people who signed in were the entire staff of the headquarters, as well as representatives of the railway bureau, various schools, employees, and groups. Chairman Li Dasan presided over the ceremony and then reported on the significance of commemorating the leader's birth and celebrating the Fifth National Congress. Then, representatives of the railway bureau, Fan Shouzhu, and employees Yang Youren, Li Guohua, Zhang Yunhe, and other comrades delivered speeches. They then shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Zou Lu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon from Guangdong <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>

<p>Central Executive Committee member Zou Lu, who departed from Hong Kong on the Pacific Steamship Company's General Pershing liner on the 9th to travel north, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8 a.m. yesterday. However, due to fog encountered en route, the ship's progress was slower, and it did not enter the Wusongkou until noon yesterday. It docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Bund Wharf at that time. Those who came to welcome him included Kong Xiangxi, Song Ziwen, Xu Kan, and other representatives, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Hai'an, Deputy Finance Minister Zou Lin, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan Qin Zhen, Central Executive Committee member Huang Jilu, Guan Suiren, Cui Guangxi, Li Renren, Deng Qingyang, Yang Dezhao, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission member Xie Zhongfu, Shanghai Municipal Government representative Li Dachao, Municipal Security Bureau representative Wang Zhinan, Municipal Party Headquarters representative Tong Xingbai, and over sixty of Zou's friends.</p>
<p>Proceeding to Nanjing That Evening</p>
<p>After the ship docked, all the welcoming personnel boarded the ship to greet him. They then disembarked and went directly to the Cangzhou Hotel to rest. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by friends in Shanghai. Afterward, at 11 p.m., they took the night express train to Nanjing. Central Executive Committee members Guan Suiren, Huang Jilu, Li Renren, Cui Guangxi, Deng Qingyang, Liu Luyin, Zhan Jusi, Bai Wenwei, He Shizhen, Yunnan representatives Zhang Xilin, Pei Cunfan, Lu Zian, and others traveled to Nanjing on the same train to attend this morning's Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Zou's Remarks</p>
<p>Zou looked energetic, although his face appeared somewhat older than before. According to his written statement issued upon arrival in Shanghai, "This time, because comrades from all parties at the Fifth National Congress felt the country's plight was increasingly urgent and there should be a method of uniting to save the nation, and because the Central Government repeatedly requested comrades Dai Jitao and Ma Chaojun to come south to urge us, all the Central Executive Committee members from the Southwest, except those who were ill or had special duties, have come to Nanjing to attend. Those who came before me included Liu Luyin, Li Renren, Huang Jilu, Deng Qingyang, Cui Guangxi, Zhan Jusi, and other committee members. Those who came separately from me include Lin Yunhai, Huang Xuchu, Chen Yaoyuan, Chen Jiayou, Xiong Kewu, Liu Jiwen, and other committee members. In addition, there are dozens of representatives from Guangdong and Guangxi and overseas, as well as university professor Dr. Cao Siwu, etc. My personal advocacy is to follow the consistent aim of saving the country, seeking national unity to overcome the national crisis. Therefore, in this time of serious national crisis, all who save the country are comrades, and all who do not save the country are enemies. This attendance at the Fifth National Congress is based on this aim, to earnestly discuss with all comrades how to start with our party to save the current crisis of the party and the nation. The current situation in China is full of holes, such as politics, diplomacy, finance, economy, military affairs, rural areas, business circles, industry, disaster relief, etc. All need to work hard to improve and rescue. If our party can first adhere to the aim of saving the country, unite as one, and then, based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's heart that the world is for all, put it into practice, and the entire party and nation take responsibility together, I believe that although China is in danger, there are still ways to solve the problems, which is what I deeply believe. The 11th of this month is the 11th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen University, and the ceremony for moving five colleges of the university to the new campus will also be held (Sun Yat-sen University has six colleges: Literature, Law, Science, Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine. Except for the medical college, which needs to be close to the city and will not be moved, the other five colleges have all moved to the new campus in Shipai). I have many personal matters, but because this Fifth National Congress is of great importance, I cannot but spare the time to attend. As for the new campus of Sun Yat-sen University in Shipai, construction began in March 1933 and was completed last year. There is a bronze statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, an agricultural museum of the agricultural college, several sericulture museums, several rice cultivation fields, a chemistry museum of the science college, an electrical and mechanical engineering classroom of the engineering college, a civil engineering classroom, six male dormitories, and one female dormitory. Therefore, in the autumn of last year, the three colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, and Law were moved to the new campus. Because the classrooms of the science college were not enough, the law college was moved instead. Completed this year are a southern gate archway, a western gate stone archway, the entire literature college, the entire law college, a biology, geography, and geology classroom of the science college, a mathematics, astronomy, and physics classroom, a chemical engineering classroom of the engineering college, a materials testing laboratory, a weak current testing laboratory, two factories, two agricultural and forestry chemistry museums of the agricultural college, an agricultural mat manufacturing room, two greenhouses, an agricultural field office, a forest office, an agricultural tool room, a storage room, each one, a power plant, several water storage fields, pumping rooms, and ancillary buildings, a water tower filtration room and ancillary buildings, a large faculty dormitory, three male dormitories, one female dormitory, a temporary hospital, a dozen sports fields and ball fields, a male swimming pool and a female swimming pool each, a milk room, cow house, pigsty, and chicken farm each. This autumn, the two colleges of Literature and Science will also be moved to the new campus in Shipai. From this point on, all five colleges of the university will be moved. From the start of construction to August of this year, it took 30 months, with a total construction cost of approximately 5 million yuan. The faculty dormitory can accommodate more than 200 people, and the male and female dormitories can accommodate more than 2,000 people. The entire campus covers more than 12,000 mu, with approximately 100 li of roads already built, and a total of more than 4.5 million trees have been planted in the agricultural fields and forests. This is the only university personally founded by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the only university of our party to commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The current situation can be told in passing."</p>

Therefore, yesterday, Secretary-General Yu was sent to contact Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, to urge the concession authorities to pay close attention and to instruct the police department of the Shanghai Municipal Council to take effective measures to strictly prevent and suppress them to ensure safety. Fessenden has agreed to do so.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Xu Qingfu Sent Letter to Zhang Shenzhi Yesterday Requesting Continued Discussion on Fishermen's Loans <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>To Conduct Earnest Consultations with the Banking Syndicate to Ensure Success</p>
<p>Xu Qingfu, Director of the Finance Department of Zhejiang Province, specially sent a letter to Zhang Shenzhi, a Standing Committee member of the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriots Association, yesterday regarding the fishermen's loan, asking him to conduct earnest consultations with the banking syndicate to save the fishermen from their predicament. The original letter stated, "Mr. Shenzhi, Greetings, This is to inform you that Dinghai's fishing industry has always been prosperous. Recently, due to the tightening policy of financial institutions, fishing warehouses have difficulty in turnover and cannot lend, causing fishermen to be unable to set sail, and the livelihood of fishermen is extremely worrying. Our department previously convened a meeting to discuss with the Central, China, Communications, Siming, China Real Estate Zhejiang, and other banks to each lend 50,000 yuan to organize cooperatives to lend to fishermen for rescue. The Bank of China has agreed because it is a production loan, but on the condition that it cooperates with other banks, but the Siming and other banks have not agreed, and there is still no agreement. I dare to ask you to appeal on your behalf to Zhuotang Mengjia and other fellow villagers in the vicinity to ensure success. The Bank of Communications has been established in Dinghai for many years and has a deep history, and it is heard that it receives a lot of deposits. Please discuss earnestly with Mr. Yigu and join the lending group together. I am dealing with the implementation of the legal tender and have to deal with many matters, so I cannot come to Shanghai in person. I specially instructed Zhang Danren to pay a visit. I have long admired your service and your contribution to your hometown. You will surely receive strong assistance. Mr. Zhang is deeply aware of the situation of the fishing industry in Dingyi. If you have any questions, please consult him face to face. This is specially to inform you and wish you well, Your younger brother Xu Qingfu. It is now known that Zhang has decided to consult with the banking community within days after receiving the letter."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government issued an order to the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus yesterday, stating, "Regarding the order, It has been found that the rumors in the city have subsided in recent days, and the concerns of citizens have also been alleviated. However, it is feared that there are a few traitors who do not understand the overall situation, thinking of taking the opportunity to sabotage to achieve their selfish plans, and causing trouble to achieve their country-endangering plans. If we do not effectively prevent them, we are afraid that it will cause unnecessary disputes. It is hereby ordered that the bureaus comply with the order, instruct all subordinates to pay close attention, earnestly admonish, and prevent any incidents that may affect social order and local peace. Those who deliberately violate this order should be strictly arrested and investigated. This is the order."</p>

<p>The All-Provinces Flood Relief Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Respectfully, our association's purchase of relief goods should be open for bidding. This year's winter clothing needs are being raised from all walks of life, and it has not been resolved to invite bids and custom-make them ourselves. However, recently, a military clothing store came to the association to request to contract the production, and said that there are rumors outside that the association has to rush to make 300,000 to 400,000 sets of relief clothing, and some military clothing stores even came to the association to volunteer to contract. The association considers it strange and is deeply afraid that someone is taking the opportunity to fabricate rumors outside. Therefore, we specially ask your municipal government to quickly forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council and order the Municipal Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate to facilitate relief work. We wish you well."</p>

<h3 id="e68">Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing Plant Sells Soy Sauce with a Percentage to Help Relief <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Mengzhang Performs in Drama, Ticket Sales Are Surprisingly Successful</p>
<p>The various provincial flood relief associations in this city believe that the flood disaster in various places this year is extremely serious, more than ever before. Moreover, the winter cold has arrived, and the north wind is roaring. The hunger and cold are pressing, and even if they do not starve to death, they will freeze to death. Therefore, the relief work cannot be delayed for a moment. The flood relief association has been appealing to all parties for donations on behalf of the disaster victims and has successively held various recreational activities to use all the income for relief. Since the beginning of the fundraising, fortunately, all parties have enthusiastically supported and assisted, and the effectiveness has been satisfactory. Recently, the water disaster general donation and the Boy Scout general mobilization fundraising were also held. The two-day external fundraising has ended, and the results are also very good. According to the Boy Scout directors and members in charge, the number of external donations has not yet been fully submitted by each team, and it will probably be announced soon. The Boy Scouts from each team are now soliciting donations from their relatives and friends. All parties are also moved by the Boy Scouts' lively innocence and tactful statements, and they are even more aware of the misery of the disaster victims, so they are happy to donate. The factory owners Shen Yanghou, Pu, and Cao of the China Agricultural Chemical Manufacturing Plant in this city, in view of the above situation, believe that all Chinese people should do their best to donate to provide relief. The factory, in order to be pragmatic, will reduce the original price of 30,000 bottles of the factory's "Three Fresh" soy sauce and sell them, using one-third of the proceeds to relieve the disaster victims. Donors can provide relief to the disaster victims and also get practical benefits, which is a win-win situation. Soy sauce is a daily necessity for every household, and it must be manufactured using scientific methods to eliminate preservatives. The factory is guided by this principle to manufacture it. This is beneficial to others and self, which is very good. It is heard that this plan has been negotiated by the factory manager Shen with the deputy director of the fundraising group of the Flood Relief Association, Li Dachao, and is now asking the Shanghai Boy Scout Council to entrust the Boy Scout teams in this city to help sell it during this internal fundraising. We hope that all sectors will enthusiastically contribute to this good deed, and the merit is immeasurable. As for the money from the sales, in addition to being received by the Boy Scouts who sell it, the rest can be sent to the temporary office of the fundraising group of the Flood Relief Association on the third floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, and the goods will be delivered to the address at any time. In addition, Ms. Meng Xiaodong and Ms. Zhang Eyun will perform dramas at the Golden Theater at the invitation of the Flood Relief Association to help relief. They have already taken the stage yesterday, and the ticket sales are surprisingly successful, which is beyond our expectations. After 8 o'clock, the "Sold Out" sign was hung up at the theater, which shows that Ms. Meng and Ms. Zhang's theatrical skills and calling ability are very large. If people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about disaster relief want to order tickets, they should do so as soon as possible to avoid missing out.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Red Swastika Society: Report on the Tragic Situation in the Zhongxiang Disaster Area <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>President Han Fuhang Returns to Shanghai to Report</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported that the Red Swastika Society previously appointed Presidents Han Fuhang and Li Yizhen to lead a relief team, carrying a large quantity of medicines and burial equipment, to Hubei Province to oversee the Yangtze River flood relief efforts. It is now known that President Han returned to Shanghai on the 6th of this month after inspecting the disaster areas. According to him, since arriving in Hubei, he has intensified the supervision and implementation of relief work, and reallocated the relief funds after inspecting the disaster areas. However, the disaster situation in Hubei Province this time is truly unprecedented and extremely tragic. The most severely affected areas include Hanyang, Hanchuan, Zhongxiang, and Tianmen counties, where floodwaters have not yet receded, leaving behind a vast expanse of water. Hanyang and Hanchuan have already been investigated and relief distributed once, and teams are now being sent to continue the relief work. Tianmen has already completed the relief distribution organized by benevolent individuals. However, after inspecting Zhongxiang County, the tragic situation there is truly beyond description. The county covers a vast area, with an east-west diameter of 190 li and a similar north-south extent. The county is divided into ten districts, with Districts 1, 2, 6, and 9 being the most severely affected. When the floodwaters suddenly descended, the water level reached approximately 40 chi, engulfing the city. This resulted in the drowning of over 23,000 people, with over 320,000 people affected. Homes, fields, graves, grain, and tools were all washed away. Over 700,000 mu of farmland were submerged, 200,000 mu were covered in sand, and over 50,000 houses were destroyed. Along the way, rubble was everywhere, and piles of white bones were seen. The landscape was entirely desert-like, resembling a living hell. At night, the cries of the disaster victims embracing each other could be heard from several li away, a truly unbearable sound. Although the Swastika Society, in conjunction with the Chinese and foreign benevolent relief organizations and the Hubei Benevolent Relief Office, has allocated 40,000 yuan for emergency relief, this amount is definitely insufficient to address the severity of the disaster. Furthermore, the county is 800 li by water and over 600 li by land from Hankou, and the road for motor vehicles has been washed away, making it extremely difficult to transport grain. A second relief team has now been dispatched to conduct further investigations. There are still many counties awaiting relief. It is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will have great compassion, generously open their purses, and contribute to this righteous cause.

<h3 id="e75">Municipal Federation Notifies All Branches to Strictly Prevent Merchants from Buying Silver Coins; Any Discovery Should Be Immediately Reported to the Police for Investigation <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagongshe, the Municipal Federation of Citizens of the First Special District believes that the government's resolute reform of the currency system this time is sincerely supported by the people of the country. However, a small number of unscrupulous merchants and vagrants are being used by others, disregarding the law, and secretly buying silver at high prices. The federation issued a special notice to all district branches yesterday, emphasizing the importance of complying with the law. If any of the above-mentioned situations occur, they should immediately report to the local police authorities for arrest and strict handling, in order to warn against illegal activities. The original text reads: "Regarding the urgent notice, since our country has been affected by the drastic changes in world silver prices, silver outflows, and currency contraction, the industrial and commercial sectors have been declining daily, and the social economy has developed into an unstable state. Our central authorities, in order to save the national economy and stabilize society, announced on the 4th of this month that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will be used as legal tender, reversing the tide and benefiting the country and the people. However, it has been reported that in the Hongkou district and other areas, small money shops and small cigarette paper shops, etc., are being used by others and are willing to flout the law and secretly buy silver coins, which is truly hateful. (It has now been resolved by the sixth executive committee meeting of this federation to notify all district branches to convey this to their member stores, and to pay close attention. If any of the above-mentioned situations are discovered again, the traitor should be immediately reported to the police for investigation, in order to block the outflow of silver, and to ensure the foundation of the country and society. This matter concerns the foundation of the nation, and it is hoped that everyone will follow and handle it accordingly. This special notice is hereby given."</p>

<h3 id="e80">Three Vagrants Sent to the Xi Qin Institute <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Liu Lingfang, the chief of the Yemiao Police Station, was patrolling the area at 7:10 PM yesterday when he noticed a person near the Yemiao wearing a padded jacket and an overcoat, resembling a vagrant. This reminded him of the frequent incidents of extortion in the area, so he immediately ordered the person to stop for questioning. However, the person was evasive, so he ordered the constable Zhang Chenghua to take him to the station. He also found a person in the Yemiao wearing old underwear and a leather overcoat, looking suspicious, and found a counterfeit yuan of foreign currency on him. At the same time, another person was also taken to the station by constable Chen Zhaolin for dressing inappropriately and looking like a vagrant. After Chief Liu returned to the station, he interrogated the accused, who identified himself as Lu Guoliang, 31 years old, from Changzhou, a comb maker, living at No. 47 Xue Longdi. He ordered the sergeant Li Hongqing to investigate in detail and found that Lu had been making combs several years ago, but now specializes in extortion. It was also found that the other two people, Gu Yuqing and Tian Chunshan, were local vagrants with no permanent occupation, engaged in extortion. Chief Liu believed that these vagrants, who do not engage in production, must be up to no good. As the winter defense period is approaching, if they are not sent to the bureau for investigation, it would be insufficient to maintain local security. He ordered them to be sent to the Municipal Police Headquarters for transfer to the Xi Qin Institute for rehabilitation.</p>

His family has more than ten mu of land and usually lives by farming. His wife, Zhou, has been working as a servant in the Zhu residence in Ba Xian Fang, Ba Xian Qiao, in the French Concession of Shanghai. He has not heard from her for more than a year. Recently, due to the scarcity in the countryside, he could not make a living, so he borrowed two yuan for travel expenses to Shanghai to look for his wife. Unexpectedly, she had left with someone to Minhang, so he pawned his jacket and took a car to Minhang. After searching for several days, he had no news. Being unfamiliar with the area and penniless, he had not eaten for two days. He walked to the Wu Jiaxiang area, where he was so hungry that he could not continue. He thought that life was meaningless and decided to die. He jumped into the river to commit suicide. After Chief Wu heard the whole story, he felt sorry for him and gave him food and drink. He also prepared a document and sent him to the Municipal Police Headquarters for relief.</p>

<p>Since the soaring gold prices, imported raw materials have increased in cost due to exchange rates. Therefore, the bread, mirror-making, and camel hair industries have successively issued notices of price increases, which are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Bread</p>
<p>The bread industry association members in this city, including Dongfang, Huili, Wanguo, Dahua, Xingli, Shunquan, Ruita, Hetai, Huitai, Jinxing, and Nanfang, jointly announced price increases: "To our valued customers, due to the rising prices of various goods, the cost of imported raw materials has increased by 30%. In order to maintain capital, our association has decided to post notices of price increases in Shen and Xin newspapers for two days each, starting today, and implement the price increases on the 16th.

<p>Mirror Making</p>
<p>The Mirror Making Industry Association announced: "To our valued customers, our industry published a notice on October 18 to slightly increase prices, and we are grateful for the enthusiastic support of our customers. However, the foreign exchange rate has recently shrunk sharply, and the prices of all raw materials have increased accordingly, resulting in a sharp increase in costs. We have no choice but to find ways to remedy this situation. However, considering the market situation, we cannot suddenly continue to raise prices. The costs of the industry should also be taken into account. Therefore, we specially convened a meeting of industry colleagues to discuss and unanimously decided to temporarily increase prices by 10% based on the prices negotiated on October 18 in order to maintain capital. In addition to sending special letters of notification, we are publishing this public notice again for your consideration."</p>
<p>Camel Hair</p>

From November 10th, striped camel hair will increase by 2 jiao 5 fen per yard, and plain camel hair will increase by 2 jiao per yard. (2) Tianxiang Camel Hair Factory announced that the competition for wool back and plain camel hair has been fierce in recent years, and the price has been at its lowest limit. Now, due to the soaring prices of raw materials, which far exceed the selling price, prices should be formally increased to maintain capital. However, given the current economic downturn in various industries, we can only slightly increase prices in order to maintain a livelihood. We hope that those who love and use domestic goods will sympathize with us. Thank you for your understanding. (3) Dada Camel Hair Factory announced that all floral and plain items will increase in price: "Recently, due to the sudden decline in foreign exchange rates, the cost of raw materials has increased. If we do not raise the price of our products, it will not be enough to maintain our operations. Therefore, starting today, we will increase the price by 2 jiao per yard. We hope that all the esteemed firms will understand."</p>

It was determined that Wang Sheng and Chen Ziheng were involved in the kidnapping, and the court approved their transfer to the Water Police for further investigation. Shi Shubang and Zhang Zhisheng were temporarily detained, and Captain Gao was instructed to provide substantial evidence within seven days for further verification. This was reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the Second District Water Police, after taking Wang, Chen, and the South City suspects along with the hostage back to the Suzhou District headquarters for interrogation, found that Shi and Zhang, who were detained in the Special Second Court, were indeed not involved in the kidnapping. The District headquarters sent a letter to the Special Second Court requesting their release. Upon receiving the letter, the Special Second Court, through Prosecutor Zhang, visited the Criminal Division One courtroom the day before yesterday and ordered that Shi Shubang and Zhang Zhisheng be brought before the court. After a brief questioning, they were ordered to be released in court. Shi and Zhang thanked the court and left.</p>

<p>Brain Concussion and Ear Bleeding Lead to Death</p>
<p>Cheng Jishi, a 42-year-old rural woman from Suzhou, had been working as a domestic servant in Shanghai. Recently, she had been unemployed and was staying temporarily at Zhang Lao's employment agency for Yangzhou natives at No. 42 Route du Père Huc in the French Concession, waiting for work. In the evening, she stayed on the loft floor of the employment agency. At 6:00 AM on the 10th, Cheng got up to comb her hair, intending to look for employment. While descending the bamboo ladder, she slipped and fell headfirst from the loft floor, her head hitting the floor. She suffered a brain concussion and profuse bleeding from her ears, immediately losing consciousness. The employment agency reported the incident to the French Concession Police, who immediately summoned an ambulance to take her to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of her injuries, medical treatment was ineffective, and she died that night. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. Since she had no family in Shanghai, the next day, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special Second Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor and clerk, visited the funeral home. The autopsy confirmed that the deceased had died from a head injury sustained in a fall. The prosecutor questioned the witness, Mrs. Zhang Wang, the owner of the employment agency, about the circumstances of the fall. He then ordered the body to be handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for burial, pending identification by relatives. Subsequently, the employment agency notified her guarantor, who sent someone to Suzhou to urge her husband, Liu Jin'an (48 years old), to come to Shanghai yesterday. According to him, the deceased was indeed Mrs. Liu. Her husband first went to the autopsy room to claim the body for encoffining, and today he will submit a petition to the Special Second Court for permission to transport the coffin back for burial.</p>

<p>Gu Jirong Fined Five Yuan</p>
<p>Gu Jirong, also known as Nai Xin, a lawyer from Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, with an office at No. 451 Jiangxi Road, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Sun Shoubo, a resident of No. 81 Shouchun North Lane, Route Frelupt, and an employee of the Zhengda Asbestos Manufacturing Factory, for abusing checks. Sun had previously entrusted Gu to collect payments, and after collecting the money, Gu issued a check to Sun, which could not be cashed when it matured. Sun filed a lawsuit. The First Special District Court completed the interrogation, and yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao held a hearing and sentenced Gu Jirong to a fine of five yuan for intentionally issuing a check with an amount exceeding his deposit. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be sentenced to labor service, with one yuan equivalent to one day. The plaintiff's incidental civil lawsuit was dismissed.</p>

<p>Kidnappers Actively Seek Customers; Chinese Detectives Investigate, Arrest, and Send to Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Zhou Jindi, a thirteen-year-old girl from Changzhou, residing at No. 10 Jinyu Lane, Changzhou, was playing alone in a nearby park on the afternoon of the 5th of this month. She was approached by a couple, Zhang Linbao and his wife, who, seeing that she was young and easily deceived, falsely claimed that they could recommend her for a job. They tricked Zhou Jindi into going to Suzhou for a temporary stay. The next day, they conspired with Yang Keming, Zhou Laosan, Zhang Lian, and others to travel to Shanghai by car, staying at a certain hotel near the North Railway Station. For several days, they actively sought customers, entrusting Wang Genhai, Li Baoshi, Wang Zhangshi, and others to find a buyer, intending to sell the girl into a brothel as a prostitute. However, their scheme was discovered by Zheng Huaili, a narcotics detective from the Huishi Police Station, who, along with Western Detective Chief Yang Mi, went to the Meihualou Teahouse at No. 175 North Fujian Road at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday and arrested the seven men and women, along with Zhou Jindi. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the above situation, stating that the police investigation was not yet complete, so formal charges had not been filed. He requested that the court detain the arrested individuals. According to the victim Zhou Jindi's complaint about the abduction, Judge Wu Zehan briefly questioned Zhang Linbao and others and ordered that they be detained for seven days for further interrogation. Zhou Jindi was temporarily sent to the Women and Children Relief Society for care.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Second Public Utilities Committee: Detailed Discussion on Telephone Rate Increase Proposal <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Supplementary Report Submitted for Discussion: Final Majority Approval of Experts' Proposals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Telephone Expert Committee's telephone report was convened for two meetings by the SMC Public Utilities Committee. After detailed discussion and repeated deliberation, the report was approved by the Public Utilities Committee with a majority in favor. During the SMC Board of Directors' special meeting the day before yesterday, the minutes of the Public Utilities Committee meeting were accepted, and the expert report was approved based on the Public Utilities Committee's recommendations. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Upon reviewing the minutes of the Public Utilities Committee's first meeting on the 28th of last month, which were previously published in Chinese and foreign newspapers, the details of the second meeting held on the 7th of this month are disclosed below, selecting the important points:</p>
<p>On this day, the first item the Public Utilities Committee put forward for discussion was the supplementary document added by the experts after the general report. A certain committee member immediately raised a question, stating that according to the experts' supplementary opinion, if the current metered rate system is maintained, the monthly fee for commercial telephones should be increased to $15.50. The original request from the telephone company was only $15.06. Why is the rate proposed by the experts higher than what the company requested? Expert Brown immediately replied that the current situation has undergone substantial changes. The number of telephone sets is expected to decrease by several thousand within this year. This loss should be included in the calculation starting from January 1st of next year. Furthermore, since this year's capital expenditure has increased, the depreciation reserve for the coming year will inevitably be greater than the current one. The committee member then asked if the company's side had been shortsighted and had not foreseen this. Brown replied that the company originally hoped for an increase of 4,000 telephone sets, but now not only is there no increase, but there is also a decrease of 4,000 sets. The difference results in a loss of income equivalent to 8,000 telephone sets for the company. Another committee member then asked why commercial telephones need to be increased more than residential telephones. Brown replied that the current telephone fees paid by residential telephones have long exceeded what they should be paying. If they are increased too much in the future, the development prospects of that type of telephone may be affected. The chairman pointed out that, according to Brown's statement, the company lost 8,000 telephone sets. If each set is rented at $15 per month, the monthly loss would be $120,000, and the annual loss would be $1.44 million. Brown also stated that the 2% annual tax paid by the telephone company to the French Concession SMC and the International Settlement SMC was only paid for part of this year, from August to the end of the year. However, starting next year, it will be paid according to the full year. The committee member said that the company must have known this when requesting the price increase. Therefore, is this decrease in telephone sets due to the metered rate system? Brown replied that the metered rate system is certainly one of the reasons for the decrease in telephone sets. As supplemented in the report, it is stated, "We firmly believe that if this metered rate system continues, the number of telephone sets will inevitably decrease day by day." According to what we have long known, many smaller users are anticipating that the measured service billing system will definitely be implemented, so they have not cancelled their telephones. If the metered rate system is maintained in the future, the decrease in users will inevitably be more severe. As for the exact number of smaller users who have not cancelled their telephones due to anticipating the measured service billing system, according to Brown, it is quite difficult to count. However, roughly speaking, the loss of telephone sets this year is more than half due to the metered rate system. The decrease in telephone sets this year has reached 3,400 sets, and most of those who stopped using the telephone belong to small users. Therefore, it is known that the metered rate system was appropriate in the past, but now the scope of the concession has expanded and the environment has changed.</p>
<p>A certain committee member immediately rose and stated that, according to the report, in 1931, the number of telephone sets increased by 2,996 sets, which is 8% of the total number of telephone sets in 1930. In 1932, it increased by 6,177 sets, which is 16% of the total number in 1931. In 1933, it increased by 4,796 sets, which is 11% of the total number in 1932. In 1934, it increased by 5,460 sets, which is 11% of the total number in 1933. All of these years used the metered rate system, but the number of telephone sets did not decrease due to the disadvantages of the metered rate system. Therefore, the current decrease in telephone sets is more likely due to economic recession. The chairman stated that what has been said above is indeed reasonable, and the reduction of the initial supply cost is urgently needed. Expert Rae stated that the rapid increase in telephone sets in the previous years had two major reasons: first, the development of the telephone business had been suppressed and latent for a long time; and second, after the establishment of the new company, the equipment was changed to automatic, and the telephone business showed a vigorous trend. However, that development will definitely not continue to grow under the metered rate system. Only after the new system is implemented will the telephone business see a resurgence, without any doubt. According to Brown, the total number of telephone sets is currently about 48,000, but from the perspective of the company's equipment scope, this number is not economical. Some committee members asked what number would be economical. Brown replied that, in the telephone business, they have never reached the point of saturation. However, if Shanghai has reached this point, and there is no need to add new equipment or new stations, then on every 10,000-line system, at peak times, it can supply 9,000 telephone sets. However, under the metered rate system, due to the extremely large volume of calls, the central switching station originally had a 10,000-line system, but it could only supply 6,000 telephone sets. If the company's entire equipment capacity can be applied to 80% or 90%, to the point where there is no room for further development, then they can say that they have reached an extremely economical and satisfactory state. Some outsiders say that the company has too many idle equipment, but if the idle equipment is 40%, it would be a mistake to say that it is a 40% waste. Major telephone businesses around the world are constantly reviewing and investigating the status of idle equipment. Taking Shanghai as an example, changes in the situation should also be taken into consideration. For example, residents in the central area are moving to the suburbs, and underground equipment must be increased accordingly. These are all matters that experts constantly consider.</p>
<p>Some committee members asked the experts to compare Shanghai's telephone supply with that of London and New York. Brown said that, according to what he knows and has heard, the supply in this city is not inferior to that of anywhere in the world. However, the humidity in this city is too high, and residents in small streets often hang miscellaneous items on the telephone lines, which the company cannot prohibit. Therefore, the obstacles caused by this may not be few. Rae also said that, according to his experience in using telephones and the information obtained from investigating the company's records, the telephones in Shanghai can indeed be compared with those in New York, Chicago, or elsewhere. Inada said that telephones in Tokyo, Japan, are also often affected by humidity, but not as much as in Shanghai. Other obstacles that Shanghai has, Japan also has. Generally speaking, the telephone supply in Shanghai is not inferior to that in Japan.</p>
<p>A committee member asked why the United States used the metered rate system in various cities 30 or 40 years ago, and then changed to the measured service billing system, but after a short period of time, some cities returned to the metered rate system. Rae replied that from 1895 to 1900, there was a trend in the telephone business to change from metered to measured service. This was a common trend in major cities. He had never heard of a measured service billing system being changed back to a metered rate system. However, in certain areas of New York and Boston, users used to pay by meter, but their calls were limited to a very small number of neighboring users. If they talked to users outside of these few users, they still had to pay 5 cents, 10 cents, or 20 cents for each call. He knew that this was indeed implemented in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. However, Chicago has always used the measured service billing system. In the aforementioned areas, there were also terms such as "intra-zone" and "intra-city" call fees.</p>
<p>Brown further pointed out that the experts stated in the report that the metered rate system can only be implemented when the user scope does not exceed one switching exchange. If in London, more than 90% of calls need to go through a connection procedure. If all users are within the scope of one switching exchange, the cost of cables between stations can be reduced. If the number of switching stations increases, the cost will have to be multiplied. Some committee members asked when London started the measured service billing system. Brown replied that when the British Post Office took over the telephone business, it specially allowed some users to continue using the metered rate system. However, by 1921, the authorities felt tired of that method and notified the old users, announcing that the metered rate system would be terminated, and the measured service billing system was universally implemented in that year. Moreover, what London implemented was a complete measured service billing system, with no first stage of free calls included. Brown further said that before the measured service billing system was uniformly implemented, the average number of calls in London and other places was 7.5 times per day. After the measured service billing system was implemented, the number of calls dropped to just over 5 times per day, a reduction of 25%. However, in Tokyo, Japan, the number of calls was reduced by 50% after the measured service billing system was implemented. The higher the original number of calls, the greater the degree of reduction in the future. If Shanghai is concerned, the degree of reduction will exceed that of London after the measured service billing system is implemented, but it may not be as large as in Tokyo, Japan. Although the metered rate system was used in England from 1879 to 1922, users were limited to a small number of old users who enjoyed special privileges. Furthermore, when the metered rate system was still in use in England, the average rental fee for commercial telephones was about £10 per year. After the post office took over, the monthly rental fee for commercial telephones in Liverpool was 12 shillings, and a fee of one penny was charged for each call. He had studied the situation in Shanghai and found it comparable. However, the fee of one penny per call in England is about twice as much as the proposed three cents in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The time for this expert investigation, research, and report was a total of two months. Some committee members asked if this time was sufficient. Brown said that this all depends on what kind of work they need to do. If all of the company's equipment needs to be evaluated one by one, the time required will be very long. When drafting this report, all of the financial reports and numbers were indeed provided by the telephone company, and the experts reviewed and determined them. On this point, it must be known that each expert has his own unique experience in equipment costs. Brown then gave a very detailed account of the method of calculating telephone set costs and the procedures for comparing costs in various places.</p>
<p>A committee member asked that since the prices of commercial and residential telephones have already been determined in the report, how much impact will the recent changes in exchange rates have on the telephone prices? Brown replied that they cannot change their recommendations due to fluctuations in exchange rates. He felt that internal costs would not increase significantly. A committee member also said that part of the company's costs is certainly related to exchange rates, such as the salaries of personnel calculated in gold dollars. Brown said that, as far as he knew, only one person's salary was calculated in gold dollars. The head of the SMC Finance Department also said that the experts' work cannot take into account exchange rate and other issues. Another committee member said that, according to the report, if the metered rate system is not changed, the company will have to increase its capital expenditure by about $3 million due to the continued increase in call volume. Fluctuations in exchange rates will certainly have a considerable impact on the company's expenditures. Brown said that he had not paid attention to or studied the exchange rate issue. The committee member immediately said that on this point, it can be seen that if the metered rate system continues, the future danger is indeed great.</p>
<p>Another committee member then discussed the valuation of the company's land, buildings, equipment, etc., and asked whether the experts had conducted in-depth investigations or only relied on the numbers in the company's accounts. Brown said that it would be unfair to say that the experts only relied on the company's accounts. Because the reason why an expert is an expert is that he must have considerable experience in these matters and must not only rely on the company's accounts as a basis, but must review each number. However, the valuation is a very complicated issue. Taking the example of the British Post Office, after the bureau took over the telephone business, it originally planned to conduct property valuations every five years, but later found the work too heavy. It took about 20 years from the time it took over the assets of the National Telephone Company to complete one valuation. At that time, there was a so-called percentage standard, which was the standard for all costs before the war. After the end of the European War, prices increased, reaching 120% by 1922. Moreover, the equipment at that time was old and urgently needed to be reformed, so the expenditure was even greater. Although the prices were very high, it could not be avoided. Afterwards, prices gradually declined until 1929, but during this period, the average price was still 80% or 90% above the pre-war price. As a result, equipment estimated at £30 million according to pre-war prices amounted to £100 million in total investment after the war. Moreover, the valuation must be carried out on a certain definite date, but under this situation, how to give it an appropriate valuation is indeed a question. If you want to do it with the Shanghai Telephone Company, you may need to hire at least 50 people and take a year. But after the valuation is agreed upon, if you do it a month later, the numbers obtained will definitely be different from the previous ones.</p>
<p>A committee member immediately stated that, according to Brown's statement, the experts did indeed have to rely on the company's accounts with a heavy heart. Brown expressed absolute disagreement with this. He said that the experts used their own experience to judge all the numbers provided by the company. Although the experts do not have expertise in the valuation of land and buildings, they still obtain independent valuations from time to time and have the SMC Works Department review them. If an explanation is needed, such as the high cost of the foundation of the Fujian Road branch, then a further investigation will be conducted. Therefore, anyone who knows of a better valuation method, he will sincerely welcome it.</p>
<p>Regarding company personnel and salaries, Hu Ruixiang stated that the total number of company personnel is 913, the average salary is $132.49 per month, and the total monthly salary is approximately $121,000. Detailed numbers can also be provided if needed. The head of the Finance Department immediately stated that the company's current salary grades do not affect the telephone prices proposed by the experts. Moreover, the company's salaries are not too high, and are roughly equal to those in other public utilities. The company has also recently implemented streamlining and saved a lot.</p>
<p>The committee members then discussed the issue of the length of calls. It is obviously unfair to charge the same fee for a one-minute call as for a ten-minute call. Furthermore, ineffective calls are also a problem. How should it be calculated when it often takes three or four calls to find the person you are looking for? Brown acknowledged that it is indeed unfair to charge the same fee regardless of the length of time. However, in order to achieve fairness, the company will have to add a three-cent metering device. Telephone authorities in various countries have long taken into account the possibility of this abuse. However, the second point has nothing to do with the company. Since the company provides users with a reasonable supply, the user should not be blamed on the company even if it takes three or four calls to find the person they are looking for. However, the time-based accounting method is often implemented when the call exceeds the range of the central station. This has also been done in London. Within the London line, the duration of the call is not limited at all. Although the company is taking some risks, there are only a few people who talk endlessly. If the scope of the call exceeds the London line, it must be calculated according to time. However, if this method is implemented in this city, the voices of opposition from all walks of life will inevitably erupt and become unstoppable. The public's attacks will probably be ten or a hundred times more intense than the current opposition to measured service billing. Therefore, the introduction of this problem has considerable danger.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the number of users who are willing to accept the measured service billing system has also been discussed. According to what has been expressed by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the majority of Chinese users are in favor of the metered rate system and have made preparations to pay by meter. Brown said that the current opposition to the measured service billing system comes from organized groups who feel that they will suffer losses. However, there is no opposition from those who pay the price for large users. The experts have made thousands of estimates on this point, and have made precise calculations on what kind of users make how many calls per month. A committee member then asked whether the experts had ignored the strong expression of support for the metered rate system from Chinese users. Brown said that what can be told now is that the experts' conclusion that the measured service billing system is feasible has nothing to do with this kind of argument. The experts' conclusion is based on scientific principles. He personally has not discovered any special characteristics of Shanghai users. If there is any, it is the method of using the telephone that is no longer seen elsewhere, but can still be seen here.</p>
<p>The head of the Finance Department then expressed his opinion, saying that what is needed now is to seek the greatest benefit for the majority. Since it has been proven that under the metered rate system, part of the telephone fees paid by small users is paid by large users, if the metered rate system is still used in disregard of the experts' advice, equipment and the like must continue to be added in the future, and the number of profits will inevitably increase accordingly. If there is no hope of reducing the company's demands, the increase in telephone prices in the future will be not only 11%, but 26%, and the decrease in telephone sets in the future has not yet been taken into account. In that case, users will unknowingly be subjected to even greater price increase demands. As capital investment increases day by day, telephone prices will inevitably rise accordingly. Therefore, price increase problems like today's will become more and more frequent. The company has no way to develop its own organization and obtain considerable profits. Therefore, according to what he has seen, if profits are to be obtained without harming the majority of users, that is, small users, there is really no good industry other than the measured service billing system. If the metered rate system continues to be used for a long time, the situation will get worse and worse in the future. By the end of 1936, the company's profit shortfall will reach $700,000. At that time, if the metered rate system is still used, the only way to recover that loss is to increase prices again. However, under the measured service billing system, the company has a hope of gradually obtaining profits. Once the profits reach that number or exceed it, the telephone price revision account can be applied at any time, and the telephone price can be reduced.</p>
<p>Regarding the number of calls, he really could not understand that the number of calls would not decrease after the measured service billing system was adopted. The head of the Finance Department added that the company has agreed to a one-year trial. In the future, if the profit exceeds one point, it will be included in the telephone fee revision for better or worse. Rae said that if the reduction in the number of calls in the future exceeds 37.5%, the company will inevitably ask the SMC to increase prices again. The head of the Finance Department admitted his statement, but according to what he has seen, this danger is smaller than the danger of continuing to use the metered rate system, because the number that should be added under the metered rate system is extremely large.</p>
<p>Brown compared the value of the telephone for users with other methods of communicating information, and found that the telephone fees under the measured service billing system are actually very low. However, if a user makes 6,000 or 7,000 calls per year, the telephone prices paid in the future will inevitably be higher than now.</p>
<p>A committee member then raised two points: one is the current situation in Shanghai. Although this situation has been mentioned in the latter part of the report, it has not been comprehensively calculated. The second point is that the experts did not have enough time to complete their investigation work. Therefore, the consideration of the economic situation of this city is the responsibility of the Public Utilities Committee. Although the public's voice is not long enough, it should also be taken into consideration. Furthermore, a 37.5% reduction in call volume, in his opinion, is still an ideal loss and has not yet been realized. The company should not increase the burden on the public in advance. Furthermore, under the current situation, the SMC's 2% annual tax should be temporarily suspended. The head of the Finance Department said that the SMC's annual tax does not have a deep relationship with the proposed telephone prices. Another committee member said that although he attaches great importance to the work of the experts, he supports their report because he feels that the experts did not have enough time during the investigation, so they had to use the numbers provided by the company as a basis for calculation, making the price increase an inevitable conclusion. Furthermore, the experts did not collect as much user opinions as possible, and the reasons why the metered rate system should be continued were not fully considered. He advocated that even though time is extremely short, experts should contribute their opinions again. He had to express his regret for not being able to support the report. The chairman declared again that no matter what proposals the committee members make on this issue, the company's consent is still needed, because the SMC cannot order the company, but must reach an agreement with it. The acting director-general of the SMC added that the company is demanding a price increase due to insufficient profits, and the SMC has to grant its request. However, if the prices proposed by the SMC still cannot give the company the profits it deserves, the company may refuse to accept them and submit the price increase issue to mediation. As for the measured service billing system, although the French Concession SMC has not yet expressed its opinion, there is a lot of support. If this Bureau's Public Utilities Committee does not support the experts' advocacy of measured service billing and the French SMC supports it, this Bureau's prestige will suffer a great loss. The head of the Finance Department said that regarding the SMC's annual tax, if the SMC is willing to give it up, the number of revenue shortages must still be shared among the citizens, and the majority of the citizens are still telephone users.</p>
<p>Then Brown, Rae, and others made a simple comparison of the first stage of call volume with the existing systems in other countries. Finally, the expert report was approved by the SMC Public Utilities Committee with a majority. The chairman finally thanked the experts for their work, and then adjourned the meeting.</p>

<p>— Compiled by China Credit Information Office</p>
<p>(One of the Overviews of Shanghai Industry and Commerce)</p>
<p>1.  The Evolution and Status of Shanghai's Textile Industry</p>
<p>Spinning and weaving have a long history, but machine manufacturing has only about forty years of history in our country. It was only after the import of machine-made cotton fabrics from British India that the Chinese began to imitate them. In the sixteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (that is, twenty-two years before the founding of the Republic of China), Li Hongzhang established the Machine Weaving Factory (commonly known as the Foreign Cloth Bureau) in Yangshupu, Shanghai, which was the beginning of Shanghai's textile industry and also the beginning of the yarn industry in the whole country. After that, the development of Shanghai's yarn industry can be observed in three major stages.</p>
<p>First, the initial stage—from the Sino-Japanese War in the twenty-first year of Guangxu, through the Russo-Japanese War, (the twenty-first year of Guangxu) to the European War in the third year of the Republic of China, was the initial stage of Shanghai's textile industry. During this period, the main actors were foreign merchants, such as Ruiji of the German merchants (later changed to British merchants), Hongyuan of the American merchants (later from British to Japanese), Yih and of the British merchants, and Donghua and other factories of the Japanese merchants, all of which were established in Shanghai after the Sino-Japanese War. Later, although Chinese merchants established Zhenhua, Jiucheng, Tongchang, and other factories, most of them were small in scale or jointly operated with foreign capital, and they were not unique. Therefore, coupled with the various malpractices of official and private joint ventures at that time, the difficulties encountered by Shanghai's textile industry in the initial stage were numerous.</p>
<p>Second, the rising stage—the European War and the years after the war were the rising stage of Shanghai's textile industry, and also the golden age of our country's yarn industry. Because at that time, except for Japan in the east, European countries were busy with the war and post-war reconstruction work and had no time to look eastward. Indian cotton and Indian yarn, which dominated the country, temporarily retreated, and the national yarn industry took the opportunity to rise. According to statistics, about twenty or more Chinese yarn factories, such as Shenxin, rose in Shanghai at that time. Among them, the most were added in the ninth year of the Republic of China, with a total of ten. However, the only drawback is that the Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai also increased at the same speed, and all of them were newly established. Unlike the Chinese merchants, some of them were reorganized. Therefore, the spindles added by Japanese merchants were 40,000 to 50,000, exceeding those of Chinese merchants by about 10,000 to 20,000. As a result, the power of foreign yarn factories in Shanghai is still strong and considerable today. This is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Third, the difficult stage—after the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the textile power of Western Europe came to the East again. After the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the national industry and commerce were affected by the National Revolution. Therefore, it is difficult to say how Shanghai's yarn industry will develop. During the period of the silver devaluation, Shanghai's yarn industry flourished for a while, but it was very short-lived. After the September 18th Incident, our country's politics was frequently affected by special influences. Last year, it was hit by the United States' silver purchase policy. Shanghai's textile industry (and the whole country as well) fell into extreme difficulties. Yarn sales were stagnant, inventories piled up, and factories stopped work or closed down. It has not yet recovered.</p>
<p>The evolution of Shanghai's textile industry has been briefly described above. Now, let's further discuss its position in the national textile industry. According to the investigation report of the Chinese Yarn Factory Association in March of this year, there are a total of 143 Chinese and foreign yarn factories in the country, and Shanghai accounts for 65, that is, 45.45% of the total number of factories in the country. In terms of Chinese factories alone, there are 95 in the country, and Shanghai accounts for 31, which also accounts for more than one-third. From this, it can be seen how important Shanghai's yarn industry is in the country.</p>
<p>2.  Overview of Shanghai's Chinese Factories</p>
<p>From the previous section, we already know the importance of Shanghai's yarn industry. However, in recent years, due to the impact of various factors, it has also fallen into difficulties like the mainland. Now, let's list the major changes in Shanghai's Chinese factories in the past three years as follows:</p>
<p>Table of Changes in Shanghai Chinese Yarn Factories in the Past Three Years</p>
<p>In terms of the number of factories, there were three more in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China than in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, and the twenty-third year of the Republic of China maintained the status quo. The future of the yarn industry seems to be stable. However, according to the actual situation, it is slightly different. Although the number of yarn spindles, thread spindles, and looms has increased, the actual number of workers or not increases in the same proportion. According to the Social Economic Monthly Report in Volume 2, Issue 7, of the 31 factories in the 22nd year, 9 factories reduced work and 8 factories stopped work. Among the total number of 1,126,204 yarn spindles, the number of spindles stopped and reduced reached more than one-fourth, totaling 365,124. Therefore, on the one hand, the number of factories, yarn spindles, etc. is increasing, while on the other hand, the number of workers and motive power is decreasing. After analysis, it seems that we cannot be optimistic.</p>
<p>Among the 31 existing factories in Shanghai, the earliest in history is the Hengfeng Textile New Bureau (its predecessor was the Foreign Cloth Bureau founded by Li Hongzhang), followed by Dongfang (that is, the current Shenxin No. 7 Factory), Tongchang Zhen, and the largest in capital are Shenxin Yongan, followed by Tongyi Dafeng, etc. The entire factories that have been shut down are Shenxin No. 2 and No. 5 Factories, and Tongchang Minsheng Jingwei Shanghai Textile Four Factories (to be continued).</p>

<p>Sending Personnel to Wusong is Difficult Due to Incomplete Equipment</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received letters from dozens of merchants, including Songhu United Transportation Company and Huiyuan Company, stating that the Song District is located in a remote corner, and most of the opium smokers in the district are employed. It is too far to go to Shanghai for inspection. Therefore, they requested that the Wusong Health Office be temporarily used as an opium addiction treatment hospital and that doctors be sent to Wusong for inspection. The Chamber of Commerce forwarded the requests of the merchants to the Public Security Bureau for verification. The Bureau stated that the handling of opium addiction treatment matters is under the jurisdiction of the Health Bureau and specially requested the Health Bureau to reply. The Health Bureau stated that the Wusong Health Office does not have the special equipment for inspecting opium smokers, so it is difficult to send doctors to Wusong for inspection. It specially sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, and the Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that it is really difficult to do so.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Zhang and Lu Wedding <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang's son, Shou Chun, of the Jiu Ji Timber Company in Nanshi, married Ms. Lu Yingqi at his residence in Nanshi at 5 pm yesterday. Mr. Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, presided over the wedding. Many celebrities and relatives from all walks of life went to watch the ceremony and offer their congratulations. The Zhang family's door was crowded with cars and horses, and it was very lively. The music teams of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Concession Public Works Department also participated in the entertainment. After the ceremony, a banquet was held, with Cantonese cuisine provided by Xinghua Restaurant, a Cantonese cuisine expert on Fourth Malu. It is said that there were more than a hundred tables.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Third Volume of the "National Studies Rare Book Library" Published <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>One of the "National Studies Rare Book Library" compiled and printed by the Central Bookstore on Fourth Malu, has published two kinds of "Xiexinji," a collection of small works by hundreds of masters in the late Ming Dynasty, and "Xiaochuang Youji," a handwritten copy by Chen Meigong. It is said that the third kind of book was published yesterday, "Zheyuxinyu" by Li Qing. Although this book is a kind of judgment, it has no "official document" air at all. The judgment of each case is entirely based on self-decision, abandoning the so-called "Great Ming Code" at that time, and relying on "human feelings." It is similar to the unofficial history called "Judge Qiao Misinterprets the Mandarin Duck Score." The writing is by no means official, but a small essay, written entirely with a pen of chanting wind and playing with the moon, and there are quite neat antitheses in between. It can be called a creation in the file, with more than 300 articles in total. This book is not only popular with legalists, but ordinary literary enthusiasts can read it as a novel. It is said that the complete set of "National Studies Rare Book Library" has 20 rare books (divided into 30 thick volumes), and one kind is published every week. The entire set is only collected for six yuan (and a large edition of "Jin Ping Mei Cihua" is presented), and those who pre-order can immediately receive the three kinds of books that have been published.</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Path to Political System Reform (Continued) <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan (November 24th in Shanghai)</p>
<p>——Respectfully dedicated to the comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang and the gentlemen who like to talk about political system reform——</p>
<p>If we say that if the political system is not reformed, the party rule will not be abolished, the tutelage will not end, and thus talents cannot be concentrated and civil rights cannot be developed; if talents are not concentrated and civil rights are not developed, then the heavy national crisis cannot be resolved. At first glance, it seems not unreasonable. However, if we investigate it slightly from the actual situation and political theory, then this seemingly right but actually wrong argument against the procedure set by the Founding Program can be broken without attack.</p>
<p>Why is that? First, I would like to ask, is "talent concentration" to be concentrated in "organization" or in "scattered"? Even a three-foot child knows that there must first be a considerable organization, and its organization must be strict, and then talent can be concentrated. Therefore, from "non-party" politics to "multi-party" politics (that is, the politics of party competition), and then from "multi-party" politics to "one-party" politics, is an inevitable trend of political evolution, and it is also an inevitable step from no organization to a strict organization. Now, on the one hand, we want to concentrate talents, but on the other hand, we want to retreat from "one-party" to "multi-party", and even from "multi-party" to "non-party", returning my Chinese compatriots to the original state of a plate of loose sand. Regardless of whether it greatly violates Sun Yat-sen's last wishes, even if it is done once, wouldn't it run counter to the original intention of concentrating talents? Therefore, today, if we don't talk about "concentrating talents", if we want to concentrate them, we can only recruit general real talents who believe in the Three People's Principles into the Kuomintang, or retreat ten steps or a hundred steps, and recruit real talents who can abide by the Three People's Principles under the Kuomintang government led by the Kuomintang, and work together to achieve the reality of concentration. Generally speaking, the more difficult the country is, the more urgent the need for political power to be concentrated, and the more natural the trend of talent to be concentrated. The Soviet Russia after the war, Italy after the march on Rome, and Germany after the success of the National Socialist Party need not be said. Even in the countries of Britain, France, Japan, and the United States, which have always had multi-party competition, there have been actions to merge into one, such as the British all-party cabinet, the French mixed cabinet, the Japanese extraordinary cabinet (and the cabinet deliberation council to recruit distinguished people), and the US Congress authorizing the president, all of which want to seek strategies to concentrate talents and concentrate power under the constitutional government of multi-party competition. It can be seen that all countries in the East and the West, because of the extraordinary times, hope to combine from division, and unlike our "celebrated scholars", they hope that my country's political system will retreat to the whirlpool of "multi-party" disturbance or "non-party" chaos before the 13th year of the Republic of China because of the dangerous national situation. Therefore, "concentrating talents" is one thing, and "abolishing party rule" is another. It must be known that "guest ministers" can still be used, let alone "compatriots"? If the party in power is loyal to the country, it will definitely be happy to use the talents of the world, as long as these talents are not vowed to betray the party that built the country. Although the Soviet Russia is a socialist country under the dictatorship of the Communist Party, why haven't talents been concentrated in the two five-year plans? Although Italy and Germany are countries under the dictatorship of the Fascist Party or the National Socialist Party, why haven't talents been concentrated in the process of building the country at home and abroad? Those who are unwilling to gather are only those who are incompatible with the doctrine of building the country, and how can those who govern the country please everyone? Take the current China as an example, there are indeed many facts that non-party talents are accommodated. There is also the possibility of concentration. Not only are the heads of local governments and administrative regions rare among non-party talents, but even in the central government, various departments and committees, many scholars, are not entirely affiliated with the party. From this, it can be seen that even if the party rule is not abolished, talents can also be concentrated, and there is no inevitable causal relationship between the two.</p>
<p>Second, I would like to ask whether the exercise of civil rights requires training? If training is required, then the element of tutelage lies in training the exercise of civil rights and serving as a stepping stone for the implementation of constitutional government. Therefore, the more complete the tutelage today, the more proper the exercise of civil rights will be in the future, and the better the results of the constitutional government will be. As long as you have read the Founding Program personally written by Sun Yat-sen, you can understand this truth. If it is said that civil rights cannot be developed if the tutelage is not ended, then why should there be a stage of tutelage after the initial military stability and national unification? National education is not universal. The common sense of participation in politics is not available. The exercise of the four powers is not skilled. Local autonomy is not complete. With this to talk about civil rights and constitutional government, the result of it is that the civil government will be built on the beach. The lessons of the past are not far away. Just flipping through the history of the twelve or three years after the founding of the Republic of China will make you suddenly realize! The reason why Sun Yat-sen personally wrote the Founding Program in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China was to learn from the past and thoroughly build a very solid foundation for the civil government. Now, suppose we are again moved by the illusory rhetoric of those self-righteous "celebrated scholars" and shake our beliefs, regardless of the degree of popular wisdom, regardless of the effectiveness of the tutelage, and think that the tutelage may as well end and the constitution can be implemented immediately, then not only will the previous achievements be abandoned, but the constitution that is hastily implemented will also end up showing a phenomenon that is neither a donkey nor a horse. Hu Shi believes that "constitutional government is the best training for constitutional government" is actually a kind of evasion. It must be known that the period of training constitutional government, in the Kuomintang, is called tutelage, which is also the tutelage mentioned in the Founding Program. The provisional constitution during the tutelage period is also the constitution during the training of constitutional government. Therefore, the need for training in constitutional government has been recognized by those who oppose tutelage and does not need to be more verbose. What needs to be explained is that the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and the promulgation of the constitution was originally a matter that should be taken very seriously. However, to think that the tutelage has been completed once the constitution is promulgated, and the constitution must be promulgated once the constitutional government has begun, is a big mistake! Article 22 of the Founding Program states: "The draft constitution shall be based on the Founding Program and the achievements of the two periods of tutelage and constitutional government, and shall be discussed and decided by the Legislative Yuan. It shall be publicized to the people at any time in preparation for adoption and implementation at the appropriate time." Since the draft constitution is said to be based on the achievements of the two periods of tutelage and constitutional government, it can be seen that the period of constitutional government is before the discussion and decision of the draft constitution. The so-called "period of constitutional government" here probably refers to Article 16 and Article 19 "the period when constitutional government begins". Now there is not a province that can see that all the counties have reached complete self-government. Originally, even "the period when constitutional government begins" cannot be talked about. For the time being, retreat ten steps or a hundred steps, then the current China, even if it wants to leapfrog and advance, will at most step into the stage of "the period when constitutional government begins". Therefore, if it is not for the sake of decorating the facade, then the provisional constitution during the tutelage period is really the fundamental law of "the period when constitutional government begins". With this provisional constitution, it can be used well, obeyed well, can train civil rights as much as possible, and can develop civil rights as much as possible. If we must formulate another constitution, we only need to discuss and decide on a draft constitution that can be applied in the early stage of constitutional government, which must contain the spirit of tutelage to the appropriate extent so that civil rights can be intensified in training within the appropriate scope, and only then can it truly be beneficial to the country and benefit the people.

<p>A 75-year-old white-haired candle maker in New York claims that someone recently asked him to customize a huge candle to commemorate the former band leader and film actor named Ross Columbus, which must burn for a thousand years. This candle maker's name is Enduni Ajelo, and he is known for making the world's finest candles. He refused to disclose the name of the person who customized this giant candle, only saying that it was an unmarried woman from somewhere in California.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Wushan Crispy Cake <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>The crispy cake in Wushan Four Scenery Garden is fatty, tender, sweet and loose, and was praised by diners in the Qing Dynasty, no less than the Song Sao fish soup by the West Lake. Whenever there was a provincial examination, the Zhejiang candidates would all try it once for pleasure. At that time, the incense of the City God Mountain was in full bloom, and the guests had to stay there, drinking tea and eating. Therefore, the business was booming, and it was vaguely opposed to the Five Willows Residence. Since the Republic of China, the shops in the upper city have gradually moved north, and Yunjuliang Road! All the mountain names belong to Wushan! The area has become a trace of the past. Now, if you ask about the Four Scenery Garden, even the people of Hangzhou will be stunned and unable to answer. The garden is located on the sunny side of the mountain, with low buildings and empty ridges, which are extremely high, refreshing, broad and clean; the trees are hidden on the left and right, and the wind can make the sound of autumn waves; facing the Qiantang River, looking at the desolate white practice, swallowing and spitting the shadows of sails, it makes people feel the sense of washing away the remaining heroes! And the fireworks of Xixing across the bank, coming out of the forest silk by silk, are no less than a picture of a maid washing her hair. It is a pity that such a good view is rarely seen by the guests. According to Yun Jiao: In the past, when Zhang Nan first came to Zhejiang, he had to come here with a staff and a book every day to drink tea, which can be said to be the confidant of the garden. Later, he called for cakes to be made, which was managed by an old woman. When asked, it has been dozens of years; and she told the story of the rise and fall. Thinking of a cake like this, why listen to the white-haired palace maid? The woman's face showed a vegetable color, and we could not bear to ask again. The cake is boiled in oil. When it is cooked, it can be separated by touching the finger, so it is incomparably crispy. When leaving, the sun was setting, looking at the fourth floor was still empty, and no one continued to us, it was a great sorrow! Then wrote a poem: "The Wushan woman is like a paragraph, try to see the short-haired frost in the living; at noon, the high-rise is empty, and the diners pity a cake with vicissitudes!" But what can it make up for?</p>
<h3 id="e112">Two Typical Characters <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Living in a house at the end of the alley are Mr. He and Mr. Yuan.</p>
<p>These two gentlemen can truly represent typical characters in two environments.</p>
<p>Mr. He is a person who loves gambling like his life. Unless he has no money in his hand. There is nothing to say. If he has money in his hand, he will gamble day and night, forgetting to eat and sleep. If he gambles smoothly, then it seems that he has made a fortune. He buys fish and meat, and sometimes pulls some relatives and friends to his house to eat and drink. He takes his wife to watch movies, go to the Great World, eat big meals, and ride in cars. If the child wants money, he always gives two hairs at a time. But if he loses the gamble, then he will not open his mouth all day. If the child makes a noise, he will raise his leg and kick his butt. If his wife says to him that the rice jar is empty, or that the rent should be paid tomorrow, then he will clench his fist and hit the table so hard that the things on the table will jump straight up, and he will have to yell with a loud voice: "You only know how to eat and die, I am not a robber, earning money is so easy!"</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan, however, is not like this. All day long, he just faces a lamp as big as a mung bean and smokes opium. If his wife asks him for a dollar to buy rice, he just pretends not to hear it. He will absolutely refuse to open his wallet until she opens her mouth for the third time. But when the opium ash container has not seen the bottom, he has already prepared to fry it. All year round, if he has money, he will fry and smoke more opium, and his face will be smiling. If he has no money, he will fry and smoke less, and the smile on his face will be reduced. He does not ask about family affairs at all, except for the separate account that his wife makes for buying food every day. Sometimes he may say a word or two, "Why do you spend so much, a dollar has been spent in three days", but he has never been harsh.</p>
<p>One day, Mrs. He said to Mrs. Yuan, "Your Mr. Yuan is still good. He is patient."</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-One: She Softly Relies on Him, Cherishing Her Moon-like Beauty; He Vigorously Admonishes His Son-in-Law, Listening to the Lion's Roar from the Next Room</p>
<p>Although Jia Duocai didn't say anything, his face was very unsightly. He looked at the opposite room and saw several women's shadows in the window. He stretched out two diagonal lines on either side of his nose and gave Zhou Tai a bitter smile. Zhou Tai said, "I know Mr. Jia must be unhappy, but this has nothing to do with your wife. If you want to blame someone, blame me." As Zhou Tai spoke, she originally wanted to cover up for Yueying, but Yueying had already glanced over from the window, seeing Jia Duocai's small mustache turned up, his two lychee eyes staring, and his face red. Her heart was pounding wildly, and she figured that even with Zhou Tai as her bodyguard, this matter wouldn't ease up, so it would be better to go out early and admit her mistake to end the scene. So, with her right hand twisting the buttons on her collar and her left hand behind her back, she bit her lip and went out of the room, slanting her body. When she reached the hallway, she stopped again, hiding behind Zhou Tai. Because her footsteps were so light, Zhou Tai didn't hear her until she was right next to her. At this time, Jia Duocai's eyes were only looking at Zhou Tai's back, so she also turned her head and saw Yueying standing with her head lowered. She looked at both sides, then grasped Yueying's drooping hand and said, "Even if you want to be a virtuous wife and loving mother, you don't have to be so scared of your husband, like a mouse seeing a cat." As she spoke, she pulled her forward. At this moment, Wang Beihai, carrying a book bag, rushed in in a hurry. He was rushing so forcefully that he didn't notice there were acquaintances beside him. Only when he reached the front did they dodge each other and stop. (360)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>She was also impatient to sit in the hall any longer, so she hurriedly announced the end of the court session, and we still escorted her back to the palace. Usually, when the Empress Dowager returned to the palace, she would always look around and inspect everywhere along the way. Today, however, she walked straight ahead without taking her eyes off the road, directly back to her bedroom. The flowers blooming in various parts of the garden were always loved by the old woman, but today, although there were also several kinds of bright seasonal flowers blooming, they no longer aroused any good feelings in her; even the little eunuchs in various places kowtowing to her as usual when she passed by could no longer win a glance from her.</p>
<p>Usually, her body was a little hunched, but today she stood very straight, like a very brave young monarch; she seemed to want to stand her own body on the body of her enemy and press him down hard, so that he would not have the opportunity to climb up and defeat her. Now she felt the weight of the responsibility on her shoulders!</p>
<p>I couldn't help but suspect secretly: Perhaps this sudden change was the result of the very flustered and urgent omen that everyone felt when we returned from Fengtian!</p>
<p>After the Empress Dowager returned to her bedroom, she impatiently ordered everyone to leave together, only allowing two female officials to stay and serve her, and I was one of those two. That poor Guangxu, although in name was still a "current" emperor, was never allowed to be involved in any major national affairs (even minor matters did not give him a chance to express his opinion). Naturally, he had already been sent away by the Empress Dowager. Even Empress Longyu and Consort Jin were ordered to leave at the same time; the other palace maids and eunuchs were even more decisively driven out by the Empress Dowager. (456)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e118">Personality <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>Mr. Wu was the chief editor of a small newspaper in the interior, and it had been two years since he started. In this kind of year, national affairs were certainly not the concern of small newspapers, but for the sake of public opinion, local affairs could not but be handled impartially, with an honest pen. Mr. Wu was originally a fool confined in his study. At first, he wanted to use this worn-out pen as three thousand Mauser rifles, to bring light to dark places, and to fight a bright path in the dark society!</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's foolish plan was put into practice for a few months, alas! The darkness of society became even thicker; and Mr. Wu's mental and physical pain was enough for him to endure. Summons from the court flew in one after another, and court hearings and trials became commonplace. However, the people in society, apart from a few close friends, still maintained considerable friendship with Mr. Wu; the rest of the people had heard of Mr. Wu's great name and shook their heads at him, especially a group of gentry gentlemen, who regarded him as a thoroughly troublemaking bad guy!</p>
<p>In addition to dealing with the law, Mr. Wu also suffered several major insults and injuries. After being insulted, he often scratched his graying head and said resentfully, "Editing a small newspaper is really not something a human does!" However, in this time of overstaffing, what else could he do? Moreover, because Mr. Wu had repeatedly been insulted, the newspaper owner had increased his salary from seventeen yuan to twenty-four silver dollars. He was grateful to his confidant, so of course he had to continue.</p>
<p>"I have my own noble personality, and right and wrong have their own public opinion, what am I afraid of!" After being stimulated, he often used this kind of Ah Q-like tone to comfort himself!</p>
<p>However, in this kind of environment, Mr. Wu's courage to fight naturally could not be mustered; his weak body could not withstand other people's fists, and because the small newspaper in the interior had no reporters and the manuscript fees were so small that they were equivalent to nothing, most of the articles in the newspaper were written by the editor. Mr. Wu changed his style and talked about trivial matters, so the sharp spirit of the newspaper gradually disappeared and gradually became a "gentleman's newspaper."</p>
<p>However, unfortunately, Mr. Wu got into a dispute again because of a manuscript: The manuscript was sent by a reporter from a major newspaper. The content of the article was a news report about the death of a certain bureau chief's wife. In an environment where it was not daring to scold people, this kind of seemingly mediocre but not common news was of course good material for a small newspaper, and the author was also a reporter running errands for that agency, so of course there would be no rumors; however, after it was published, a friend suddenly ran to Mr. Wu and said, "Old Wu: What mess have you made again? The unmarried wife of a certain sub-bureau chief is alive and well, how did you create such a rumor? Now a certain bureau chief, because of the news in the newspaper, has received more than a dozen mourning telegrams, is furious, and has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit, and it must be resolved legally." Mr. Wu, hearing that the news was inaccurate, of course felt apologetic in his heart, so he wanted to ask that friend to mediate, but that friend shook his head and said, "I have already spoken to him for you, but he refused outright and really can't help."</p>
<p>In this kind of environment, Mr. Wu could not but make legal defense work. The first step was to bring the reporter who wrote the manuscript to ask about the source of the news. That reporter busily took out a mourning strip reporting the death of a certain bureau chief's wife, and it was printed with a certain bureau's mailing address, so of course it was not a rumor made by a friend. So, in order to make an investigation, Mr. Wu also collected several newspaper strips from other newspaper offices. Fortunately, a certain boss in the newspaper office was newly appointed as a lawyer, so Mr. Wu went to visit him to inquire about legal protection. That boss was particularly happy that day and told Mr. Wu that there was no problem at all. Unless a certain bureau chief sent a letter to correct the error, let him file a lawsuit and ignore it.</p>
<p>After Mr. Wu got the guarantee from a certain boss, he returned to the office very confidently, but that friend who reported the news was already waiting in the editorial office, and opened his mouth to say, "A certain bureau chief has voluntarily reconciled, as long as you publish a correction notice, the matter will pass." Mr. Wu of course refused outright at first, but he couldn't stand that friend's repeated requests. Mr. Wu thought of that friend's intention, which was always well-intentioned, and lawsuits were not a happy thing after all, so Mr. Wu disobeyed a certain boss's orders and wrote another piece of corrected news; as a result, the situation became big, a certain boss was furious, and Mr. Wu's rice bowl was declared broken because of the boss's anger.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu stepped out of the newspaper office and stood blankly on the street corner: He thought of his future life, he thought of the boss's power, he thought of his friend's friendship. The setting sun gradually went down, and Mr. Wu's shadow became longer and longer; he was at a loss, vaguely saying: "I have my own noble personality, what am I afraid of!…"</p>

<h3 id="e120">Record of Chairman Lin's Inspection of Education in Fujian <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Inspected a total of eleven schools and social education institutions, and believes that education in Fujian Province has made great progress compared to the past</p>
<p>When Chairman Lin of the National Government returned to Fujian to pay his respects to his ancestors, he not only inquired in detail about the handling of education in Fujian Province from Education Director Zheng and praised it deeply, but also returned to his hometown on October 17 to participate in the completion ceremony of the new school building of Fenghang Elementary School, and personally delivered a speech to encourage the children of his hometown to work hard and make progress. The elementary school was built by Chairman Lin at his own expense two years ago, and it is well-managed. On the morning of the 21st, he went to the Fujian Provincial Fuzhou Normal School for inspection with Military Advisor Mao and Education Director Zheng. After inspecting the newly built auditorium and classrooms for a week, he went to the Fujian Provincial Fuzhou No. 3 Elementary School to visit Sun Yat-Sen Hall. This hall was originally the Qing Dynasty's Minglun Hall. When President Sun came to Fujian in the first year of the Republic of China, he lectured there. In order to commemorate the President, people from all walks of life renamed it Sun Yat-Sen Hall. It is currently being renovated with funds allocated by the Central Party Department at the joint request of Chen Xiongbao and Chairman Chen Gongru. At nine o'clock, he went to the Fujian Provincial Fuzhou High School. The principal and teachers of the school respectfully welcomed him at the door. More than 800 male and female students, all wearing uniforms, gathered in the large playground and lined up to pay their respects. The Chairman expressed his extreme satisfaction with the neatness and cleanliness of the school and the students' lively spirit. At ten o'clock, when he went to visit the Provincial Science Museum, high school students in the museum's physics, biology, and chemistry departments were all practicing. The Chairman greatly praised the students' spirit and interest in studying science, and especially praised the museum's thorough and economical equipment and orderly management. He also lingered for a long time on the equipment of the weather station and the arrangement of the animal enclosure, and took photos at the museum as a souvenir. At eleven o'clock, he went to the Fujian Provincial Fuzhou No. 1 Elementary School. This school is a famous elementary school in Fuzhou. About 1,800 students lined up in the large playground to perform health exercises. Their clothes were clean and their steps were orderly, which greatly pleased the old man. Afterwards, he went to the Provincial Short-Term Compulsory Simple Elementary School. The school used an old General Temple as a school building. Most of the students were poor children, about 200 people. Chairman Lin believed that the two-part system and complex teaching method practiced by the school were particularly suitable. After the inspection of the prefecture was completed, he went to the Provincial Library to visit. In the afternoon, he went to the Fujian Provincial Fuzhou No. 2 Elementary School. The school's products won the Ministry of Education's greatest praise at last year's National Elementary and Middle School Labor Achievement Exhibition. At that time, when the Chairman visited the venue in Beijing, he also gave it a high rating. On this day, in addition to the personal inspection, he also the principal of the school and the labor science teacher guided the students in making various items such as human-faced bamboo earth batteries and flower baskets, etc., and sent them to on the 26th of the month to be exhibited in Beijing. He also personally wrote the four characters "Happy Education Cultivating Talents" and gave them to the school. Afterwards, he went to the Commercial Press to purchase various practical books about children and bestowed them on the school. At nine o'clock on the morning of the 23rd, he visited the Fujian College, inspected the classrooms, dormitories, farm, experimental rooms, family study rooms, etc., and finally went to the private Guangfu High School, where he spoke to the students for about 30 minutes, and toured the weaving department and the industrial field. In total, Chairman Lin inspected four ordinary elementary schools, one short-term elementary school, two middle schools, one normal school, one college, and two new education institutions. He believes that education in Fujian Province has made much progress compared to the last time he returned to Fujian, and has given many encouragement to the educational authorities.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association began to bury educational films in various schools on a weekly rotation, it has achieved remarkable results. Originally, it was planned to screen three times per school per semester, and four times per screening, which was not economical in terms of time. Therefore, it has been approved by the Education Bureau to revise the method, screening twice per school per semester, and increasing the number of films screened each time to six volumes. Each time, the schools and times for the next week's screenings will be announced first. If any schools wish to change, they can fill out a notification form and notify the association in advance. It is known that the association has announced the schools that will be screened next week, which are recorded as follows: Zuguang Elementary School at 3:00 PM on the 18th of this month, Shuji Elementary School at 6:00 PM, Peiben Elementary School at 8:30 PM, Cangji Elementary School at 2:00 PM on the 19th, Qingxin Girls' Middle School at 4:30 PM, Songxue Elementary School at 7:00 PM, Feihong Elementary School at 1:00 PM on the 20th, YMCA Middle School at 5:00 PM, Youde Elementary School at 7:30 PM, Qilu Elementary School at 10:00 AM on the 21st, Shangwen Elementary School at 2:30 PM, Xin Elementary School at 6:30 PM, Guangming Elementary School at 10:00 AM on the 22nd, Zhenru Elementary School at 7:00 PM, Xicheng Elementary School at 1:00 PM on the 23rd, Meixi Elementary School at 4:30 PM, and Nongtan Elementary School at 8:30 PM.

<p>Wang Sisters' Tennis Performance</p>
<p>Grand Occasion in Bian</p>
<p>Quite Wonderful</p>
<p>(Kaifeng Correspondence) Wang sisters, famous national female tennis players, Chunxu and Chunxian, made their first performances in Bian today (9th) starting at 2 pm. Less than an hour beforehand, over a hundred people were waiting with their tickets. The Wang sisters, wearing white velvet coats, entered the stadium amidst audience applause at the strike of 2. Players from Bian, also in military attire, entered the stadium together. The performances began after a photo session. People thought it was already spectacular under their slight showing. Formally begun, first was the doubles match between Lu Xifen, Tong Zhiren against Wang sisters. The Wang sisters were overwhelming, taking two games in a row. Lu Xifen quickly revitalized, winning back one game. The Wang sisters won another game. Lu struck vehemently, making the Wang sisters run around to the point of exhaustion, winning four games in a row, then ended the match with 7 to 5. Lu Tong won. Second was the five-game match between Lu Xifen and Xu Zhonghui against Tong Zhiren and Chen Jingpan, which ended at three to two. Lu Xu won. Last was the mixed doubles match between Wang Chunqing and Xu Zhonghui against Wang Chunwei and Lu Xifen. Wang Lu won the first game with six to two. Wang Xu won the second game with six to three. The two sides competed fiercely in the last game. Wang Lu eventually won the final victory with eight to six. Overall, the two Wangs played wonderfully today. Both forehands and backhands were low and forceful. A'di's backhand was particularly good, often making Lu Xifen helpless. Lu Xifen was excellent at first, but afterwards she was probably tired from the long battle and did not play as well. Although Xu Zhonghui was flustered when she took the court, her clever drop shots today were quite unique. As for Chen Jingpan and Tong Zhiren, there was nothing spectacular. The two Wangs will leave Bian after tomorrow's performance. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Lu Xifen, Tong Zhiren 7 - 5 Wang Chunqing, Wang Chunwei</p>
<p>Lu Xifen, Xu Zhonghui 2 - 2 Chen Jingpan, Tong Zhiren</p>
<p>Wang Chunxian, Lu Xifen 6 - 2, 3 - 6, 8 - 6 Wang Chunxu, Xu Zhong</p>

<p>Tennis player Li Guangjun and swimmer Liu Bingpei also stay in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yang Shuhui and his brother, the captain of the Philippine basketball team that participated in the Sixth National Games, and team captain Zhang Liangxiong and three others did not return south with the team after participating in the National Games in Shanghai. They have now enrolled in Chi Chih University on Shuidian Road, Jiangwan. Yang and others have superb basketball skills, quick reflexes, and accurate throws, and have already reached a state of perfection. They were appreciated by everyone during the National Games (it is said that the Philippine basketball team defeated Hunan 90 to 22 and Sichuan 100 to 20 in the National Games, setting a new record in the basketball world, but unfortunately lost to Beijing 39 to 49 in the semi-finals). Chi Chih basketball was originally a force to be reckoned with in Shanghai, and now with the addition of four players, it is like adding wings to a tiger. It will once again dominate the basketball season. It is reported that many famous athletes from various places have stayed in Shanghai to study or seek employment after participating in the National Games. Swimmers include Guo Zhenheng and Liu Bingpei, tennis players include Li Guangjun, and football players include Chen Zhenhe. Two female athletes from Malaysia are also studying at 两江.

<p>The Call Money Market Was Closed, and the Foreign Exchange Market Was Dull.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Banks Were Nervously Purchasing.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Market Was Initially Firm But Gradually Loosened.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday started with strong purchases by Chinese merchants but weakened later. The Hong Kong market was firm. The process of the day was initially tight but loosened later. Early in the morning, overseas calls indicated that the London rate was close to the previous level but rose by 0.0625. The price of gold in London rose by one penny, the exchange rate between the pound and the US dollar narrowed by 0.125, and the exchange rate between the pound and the French franc fell by six pounds. The US market was completely closed, and market sentiment was still good. The exchange market opened in the morning with a selling price of one shilling and two pence 4375 for the near-term pound and 29.6875 yuan for the US dollar, which was 0.0625 tighter for the pound and unchanged for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After the opening, Chinese merchants continued to purchase strongly. Run Chang Yu and the Dalian group successively settled near-term and far-term US dollars, tightening the market. Although the Guangdong group provided some supply, it was minimal. Banks turned to buying, and the process became fixed. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced its exchange rates, which were unchanged for both the pound and the US dollar. The situation stabilized slightly. Later, although the Hong Kong market did not appear tight, Sassoon's settlement of shillings caused Japanese and Chinese merchants to purchase US dollars again, tightening the process. Swap rates also became more divergent. The Indian Silver Bureau predicted no change, and banks took advantage of the high prices to fill orders slightly, but the market softened at noon. The afternoon market was very mediocre and lacked change. Later, due to quiet buyers, Chinese merchants slightly settled the near-term rate, and the Hong Kong market firmed up and loosened. The initial report from the Indian Silver Bureau was a reduction of 5.5.5 Anna, which had little impact. The second telegram from the Indian Silver Bureau later stated no change, and the situation stabilized. Afterwards, trading became sparse and lacked support. Selling pressure became stronger, and the Hong Kong market continued to firm up and loosen. The closing selling price for the pound was one shilling and two pence 4375 and half a penny to match, and the US dollar was 29.6875 yuan, which was slightly softer compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants slightly purchased US dollars, about 200,000 yuan. Sassoon Japanese Bank Mobil also paid, and now the transaction price for the day will be recorded later.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>The Recent Increase in Yarn and Cotton Prices</p>
<p>Yarn Up 30 Yuan, Cotton Up 10 Yuan</p>
<p>--And the Brand New Front Lines of Both Long and Short Positions--</p>
<p>The recent changes in the yarn and cotton market in the past two weeks have been rarely seen in history. The market has experienced a dramatic surge, completely affected by the gold market fluctuations. The call money market price has soared, reaching the third major threshold, passing 1,000 yuan, then exceeding 100 yuan, and then breaking through the 200 yuan threshold. New peaks have emerged endlessly, and the market sentiment has been greatly shaken. Rumors are rife, and there is no consensus. Group discussions focus on currency, and speculators are in a frenzy. Certain parties and banking circles are engaged in animal husbandry purchases. One cotton merchant has purchased as much as 70,000 bales of cotton and 14,500 bales of yarn at the highest. Mei Ji has also purchased about 30,000 bales of cotton. All of these are new purchases. Min Feng Yarn Factory and foreign merchants have the largest amount of short selling. In view of the tense situation, they are actively covering their positions, and the surge has continued. It is found that Chang Feng and Da Feng have the largest amount of short positions in cotton yarn, and they have successively purchased and tended to reverse to long positions. According to this movement, market prices will inevitably soar, and rumors are rampant for a time, soaring endlessly. It is found that the market price of standard yarn for October 15th of each month was between 173.4 yuan, and the price of standard cotton was about 33 yuan. Starting from the 16th, it began to rise until November 4th. The Ministry of Finance announced that the paper currency issued by the Central China Communications Bank is the legal currency, and cash may not be used. Therefore, the market situation was panic-stricken, and the buying frenzy was unprecedented. The opening price of the first board of each month broke through the 200 yuan threshold, and cotton all rushed out of the 40 yuan threshold. The far month jumped by 3 yuan to 43 yuan, and the December futures of standard yarn jumped by 6 yuan to 204 yuan, discovering the new peak since the abolition of taels and the change of yuan, which is an unprecedented new record since the establishment of the exchange, fully demonstrating the intensity of the surge. Subsequently, the bulls profited and sold, and the securities firms also sold, and the market price immediately plummeted. The December futures, which had the most intense surge, fell by 9 yuan from the peak. The difference in the rate on one day was as much as 9 yuan, fully demonstrating the chaos in the market. Later, the local authorities strictly prohibited rumors and raising prices, and all industries tended to be quiet, and the market gradually calmed down. The yarn market returned to normal. However, it is found that the bulls still do not underestimate the yarn and cotton market prices after the change of legal currency, and still adopt the strategy of buying on dips. Therefore, the bull's share is still concentrated and not released. The following is an excerpt of the recent lineup of standard yarn and cotton longs and shorts for reference:</p>

<p>No Difference Between the Northern and Southern Rice Markets</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of nearly 30 boats arrived from various sources (totaling over 6,000 stones of goods). Due to the cloudy weather, sellers' thoughts were ambiguous, and they shouted up prices as soon as they were listed. However, the sales market was sluggish, and the momentum was weak, and the situation was relaxed. Fortunately, the stomach bag was uninterrupted, and nearly a thousand bags were picked up from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao and other groups. The price of thin rice was able to stand, and the new japonica rice was also fixed. The supply and demand of Du Yangjian was equal, and there was no difference. However, the early rice from Nan'gang arrived in groups and sales were stagnant, and the depreciation fell to 角砠阴 and changed to 元 flat and flat. There was no difference in 破礱.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were 37 or 38 sources, and the sales of various goods in the market were normal due to the cloudy and humid weather. The market prices of white japonica rice and Yangjian Du Jian埠尖客尖 were stable. Thin rice and late japonica rice were slightly soft, and other goods were the same as before.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<p>New Asphalt Prices Seen to Rise</p>
<p>The new asphalt products from various producing areas have already been seen, but the products from the two groups of Han and Shanghai have not yet arrived. The Hankou market has to wait for the goods to be shipped from the E'xi Jingyi area, so the new asphalt product is seen later than in Shanghai. The existing stock in Hankou is still Chen oil, and the winter sales market has already started to move slightly. Because the cost of the Hakka is high, they are unwilling to sell at low prices. 重荆 must not be less than thirteen taels, and since the currency system has been improved, there is no need to worry about tightening of silver, so the Hakka's willingness to sell is even more firm. It is heard that there are only buyers and no sellers in recent days, so it must be added if you encounter a deal. The price of 麻城油 must also be twelve taels and five or six qian, and the price of 津市重砠 is probably more than thirteen taels. 本雄 traders never pay attention to 汉 in the early stage of new products, but rely on the new oil from the neighboring Zhejiang province for 注. It is heard that the new 本车油 from Jiaxing can be shipped on the same day, but the price has been taken over by the wholesale households on the spot, and the price has been increased by about two yuan, so the new oil is more expensive than the Chen oil. The market scale price of the 合到 Shanghai market is 19 yuan per tan. The traders are not convinced by such prices, so there are very few transactions. Generally, they are unwilling to pay the price unless it is urgent. However, the annual order is rich everywhere, but the new prices have risen, which is really unexpected.</p>
<p>White Tung Oil Turned from Decline to Sales</p>
<p>Since the new white tung oil was produced, the price has continued to fall, and it has been stable until the previous week. The lowest price sold by foreign firms in Hankou was 48 yuan in foreign regulations. Last week, the currency system was improved, and the loading and transportation in various producing areas could not help but wait and see, so the source of Hankou could not be prosperous. Although the spot oil transactions of various foreign firms were only dozens of tons, the arrival of goods was slightly scarce, and they showed a state of being insufficient for sales. The market has also turned tight, and the spot oil has been increased to 52 yuan and 10 cents per tan in foreign regulations. The futures oil for delivery in December is priced at 51 yuan. The total amount of futures and spot transactions is two or three tons. However, the currency system is now implemented everywhere, so the source of goods in the future will be prosperous day by day, and the market may fall slightly. However, the futures oil is now around 50 yuan, and even if it falls, it will be limited. In short, the key still depends on the prosperity of export trade.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>关金 Tightened, and Foreign Sugar Prevented Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was driven by the tightening of 关金, with a listed price of 2.280 and a purchase price of 2.285, so the trend was slightly stronger. The guild's plate division was 24 coarse sand white spot price of 21 yuan and 9 and a half corners, and there were already transactions. The transferred goods were priced at 6 yuan and 9 corners. The 本厂 cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 21 yuan, No. 2 was 20 yuan and 8 corners, No. 3 was 20 yuan and 5 corners, No. 4 was 20 yuan and 3 corners, and No. 5 was 20 yuan and 2 corners</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," Conn said, trying his best not to be rude, feeling it wasn't as difficult as he had thought.</p>
<p>"Now, let's take a look at that foot, ah-ha – this isn't good. We'll have to ask Dr. Field to come tomorrow. Shu, bring some hot water and gauze."</p>
<p>Mr. Pei washed and bandaged the injured foot. Mrs. Shu prepared the only empty bed in the house, which was located in the small parlor next to the sitting room. The children often used it when they were feeling unwell, as this saved Mrs. Shu from running up and down, and the patient wouldn't be lonely. Once the bed was ready, Mr. Pei carried the young boy in his arms, took him into the room, helped him undress, and placed him on the small white bed. Finally, he shook his hand and said in a fatherly manner, "I hope you sleep well tonight, my child," and then left.</p>
<p>Conn fell asleep immediately and slept soundly for several hours. Then his foot started throbbing again, and he woke up, tossing and turning, feeling extremely uneasy,忍着 not groaning to avoid being heard, because he was indeed a brave warrior, enduring the pain, truly like a "hero."</p>
<p>Mrs. Shu was accustomed to making nightly rounds of the entire house, so that if the wind was strong and the weather cold, she could close the windows, tidy up the mosquito net on Tandy's bed, and also take care of Tao Mo, because he sometimes got up and walked around in his sleep. The slightest sound could wake her. Sometimes she heard sounds that she thought were thieves, civet cats, or even a large fire. The doors of all the rooms were left open. So, that night, her sharp ears heard Conn's faint groans, and she immediately got up. He was disappointedly pounding his hot pillow when he suddenly saw a light flickering from the doorway, and then Mrs. Shu slipped into the room, looking like a funny ghost because her hair was tied into a bun in the center of her head, and she was dragging a long gray robe used for dressing behind her.</p>
