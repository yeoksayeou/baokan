<p>道義兩字爲解決中日難局根本原則</p>
<p>東北問題爲國民反感心理重要因素</p>
<p>經濟提攜彼此應有互助互惠之誠意</p>
<p>牯嶺　蔣委員長十四日對東京大阪朝日新聞記者之訪問、作下列之談話、</p>
<p>日記者間、（一）東亞大局上中日兩國有提攜之必要、提攜之方法如何、蔣委員長、（答）中日兩國不僅在東亞大局上看來、有提攜之必要、即爲世界大局設想、亦非提攜不可、因亞東只有中日兩個國家、同時這兩個國家、亦是世界之重要份子、至於中日提攜、首當以道義爲出發點、則提攜不難具體實現、</p>
<p>（二）對於日本及日本人之意見如何、請不客氣的賜敎、（答）貴國維新以來、進步之速、及一般國民忠義孝友之德、禮儀勤儉之風、向所傾偑、但如拋棄東方文化之固有精神、而爲崇力黜理的思想所支配、則爲至惋惜之事、</p>
<p>（三）中日兩國現在之難局、有無解決之根本良策、（答）余始終認爲道義兩字、是解決中日兩國現在難局之根本原則、君既爲希望中日提攜之新聞記者、應先澈底了解中國人民真正之心理實際、談中國不但無排日之行動與思想、亦本無排日必要的理由、但中國人民、實普遍的具有深刻的反清思想、即排斥清室總統治之思想、積三百年間之不斷奮門、始得解脫滿清惡政之覊絆、全中國人民至今尚有極沉痛之回憶、自東北問題演變至現階段、創痛愈深、此一思想、可謂根深蒂固、萬難消除、如東北問題、一如今日之現狀、則此種反感心理、日見深刻、史實所積、非任何力量所能消減、故研究中日提攜、能否實現、萬不能忽略此種國民心理之重要因素、</p>
<p>（四）關於改變排日態度、改善兩國感情、尤其在敎育上、委員長之意見如何、（答）中國向來崇尚信義和平、冀與各友邦增進合作、若仇恨觀念、則向非所取、即在敎育上亦復如此、總以養成仁愛互助之德性爲主、凡違反此種精神、而足以引起仇恨心理者、爲健全國民思想、自當注意矯正、但關於敎育與思想、必須兩國均有同樣之注意與努力、而對於中國避免侵略與侮辱之事實、勿再引起我國民任何之剌激、與百世莫解之陷恨、乃有根本解善感情之可能、</p>
<p>（五）請問對於中日經濟提攜之感想、（答）此事有一前提、應先從改善兩國間之現狀、並恢復共正常關係做起、則合理而互利的純粹經濟提攜、不但可能且有必要、但彼此應有互助互惠之誠意、不可含有共他之作用、</p>
<p>（六）對於廣田外相對華政策之演說、委員長感想若何、（答）此次廣田外相對華政策之演說、雖極抽象、但吾人對之感想頗深、至少可說是中日關係好轉之起點、余想廣田外相必能以此後事實證明其演說之內容、同時我國民衆亦可因此而得一番對日之新認識、</p>
<p>（七）對於民族復興國民黨所採步驟、似不無過急、自然生出排外之傾向、尤其中日間易起糾紛、尊見以爲如何、（答）孫中山先生所領導之國民革命、其目的祇在求中國之自由平等、中國近來正在本此獨立自強之精神、爲建設一現代國家而努力、當不致引起對外糾紛、</p>
<p>（八）過去在日本經騐對中日間認爲以外交方式、更易得到解決、鄙意以爲以後應以誠意解決爲最妥善、尊見以爲如何、（答）余認爲中日問題、唯依正義可以解決之亦唯依外交方式、乃可得到解決、</p>
<p>（九）對於日本所倡之大亞細亞主義、請以中國地位不客氣的批評、（答）關於大亞細亞主義、請參考孫中山先生之遣著、即可明瞭鄙人之意思、</p>
<p>（十）個人認爲中國有相當程度獨裁之必要、委員長之意如何、（答）中國與義德諸國國情各異、不適宜於獨裁、</p>
<p>（十一）請問委員長對中國歷史上最崇拜之人物爲誰、（答）中國歷史上可崇拜之先聖賢哲甚多、余所及身私淑而畢身服膺者、則孫中山先生也、</p>
<p>（十二）對於日本古今人物、委員長有無尊重之人、其人爲誰、（答）維新以前之賴山陽、維新諸傑中之勝安房與吉田松陰二氏、均爲余所欽偑者云云、（十六日中央社電）</p>

<p>— 敬</p>
<p>當去年年底日本宣言廢除華盛頓·倫敦·兩條約所規定之英美日海軍比率時。英美雙方皆力持鎮定。一則因該項條約尚有二年之實效。二則日本財力有限。英美諒其不敢輕於發動建艦之競爭。自本年開始迄今。爲時一月有餘。三國海軍問題尚未聞有何惡化之趨向。即首倡撤除海軍比率居心獨霸西太平洋之日本。對於英美外交。亦以促進常軌爲標榜。如最近美國阿里索那省排斥日本僑農之舉。日方與論尚能鎮靜如恒。差可見其態度之一般也。</p>
<p>惟就海軍實力而論。預料在明年海約失效之時日本海軍將有七十五萬四千噸。其中並無陳舊之艦艇。美國號稱一百二十萬噸。但有巡洋艦。航空母艦。驅逐艦。潛水艇等多艘尚未完成。實力殆不過九十四萬噸。英國號稱一百二十二萬噸。而有九萬四千噸未成之艦艇。及六萬噸之老朽船隻。實力僅一百零六萬六千噸。驅逐艦與潛水艇爲近海作戰之利器。日本在此二項均占絕對優勢。即輕重兩種巡洋艦之比率。與英美相較。亦超過百分之七十一。以言攻擊。或有未足。以言自守。則綽有餘裕。</p>
<p>美總統羅斯福氏鑒於國際危機之緊迫。頗表同情於軍擴派之主張。擬積極實施二十萬萬美金之國防計劃。此一計劃茍能實施。則美國沿太平洋之領土。可以安如磐石。無復有被侵之虞。此外如該國前空軍司令米克爾少將高唱飛船政策。主張以齊伯林式飛船五十艘。在必要時。直達亞洲任何國家。將其炸燬。而最近陸軍委員會亦擬投資一千一百萬金圓在夏威夷建設大空軍根據地。二百萬金圓在太平洋沿岸加築要塞防衛。八百萬金圓充實各要寨中之駐屯部隊。九千萬金元增加軍用裝甲飛機八百架。使其陸軍中之近代式新機一躍而爲二千三百餘架之多。</p>
<p>按美國所以懷此軍擴計劃者。第一。認夏威夷羣島爲其本國領士之一部分。與菲律賓尋島絕異。第二。近代交通工具日趨發達。舊金山與檀香山聞之飛行距離祇十五小時。故爲自衛計。尤須積極整頓空軍。第三。華盛頓條約對於菲律賓。關島。及亞留仙羣島之防禦工程皆加限制。故必須以夏威夷爲其最前之防綫。</p>
<p>與美國隱然處於敵對地位之日本。對於美人擴張空軍一舉。恐慣特甚。故於所謂空軍第二次補充計劃之外。更預備第三次之補充。將陸海軍雙方之所屬飛機全體更新。以長距離續航力之新機替代舊者。務使力足制止美機之進攻。吾人皆知日本式備最深者。厥爲敵國空軍之轟炸。蓋其國境四週環海。軍有天險。在立體戰爭未發展之前。確可自誇安全。詎知空軍發達。日新月異。地理上之險陰固已失所憑藉。而各主要都市之木造建築。仍居全部百分之八十以上。一但及空軍襲擊。縱出全力防禦。究亦足以牽動大局。然則美國熱心於空軍之擴張。真意殆在於斯。總之。最近海軍問題雖無何特殊之發展。而英美日之對立形勢。則仍甚緊張也。</p>

<p>對國聯及中東歐約隻字未提</p>
<p>［柏林］德國對於倫敦議定書之覆文、於柏林倫敦巴黎三處同時發表、此文開首即謂、德國與英法政府同有推進和平之誠意、蓋和平之保持、不僅有利於他國、抑且有利於德國也、故德國對於英法建議之公開討論、極表歡迎、德政府願將英法建議書第一部所引起之歐洲各複雜問題、提出作詳細之審議、斟酌德國地理環境、以保德國之安全、德政府尤願考慮如何避免軍備競爭之危險、蓋此一問題、全爲各國不守各種和約之裁軍條欵之結果、德國深信唯有於自由之討論中、始能將軍備問題之澈底解決、該文對於締結防空公約亦加以歡迎、德國並願以其空軍之力量作爲擾亂和平之製裁、唯在德國正式參加談判之前、甚願與各國政府作個別之預議、最後該文謂德國與英法政府全然同意、以爲防空公約之締結、確爲安定歐洲之辦法云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］德國答覆二月三日英法所提建議之覆文、果如豫料、今夜在柏林發表、對於英法德比意五國締結空中公約一舉、表示歡迎、覆文中謂德政府在原則上準備用其空軍制止對和平之騷亂、故渠殊願儘速獲有關係諸政府自由之同意、覔取方法、使此種擔保諸簽字國最大可能的安全之公約、得以實現、惟許多方面之談、今一切尚未有充分之準備、殊易引起衝突、爲締成天空公約起見、宜避免此種談判、德政府以爲當參加此種談判之前、宜與有關係諸政府以各別之公約、分清若干原則上之第一步問題、故德政府殊願英政府先與德政府直接交換意見、蓋英政府爲倫敦談話之一份子、且爲洛迦諾公約之擔保人也、英政府以爲空中公約之締結、將爲趨向歐洲各國團結之重要步驟、而足導成歐洲其他各問題之滿意解決、德政府對此意見、殊表同情、德政府與英法政府相同、亦抱有增進與保全和平之至誠、故殊歡迎英法來所表示鼓起各政府間討論的友好信任之精神、覆文繼謂德政府願以注意和平興注意德國安全相同之精神、透澈研究倫敦公報第一部份所舉歐洲各問題、德政府尤注意研究軍備競爭之危險、將來可以何法避免之、蓋自武裝雄厚諸國不能履行條約中所規定之軍縮、此種危險業已發生也、今唯如倫敦公報中所表示各主權國間自由妥恊之精神、能導成軍備範圍之永久國際解決云云、覆文中對於英法所建議德國復返國聯一節、一字未提、而亦未述及東歐中歐公約、殊惹人注意、此項覆文已由德政府另送法意政府、英閣員因無暇加以討論、故倫敦官塲方面尚未有何評論、據外交界之意見、覆文中唯對於天空公約表示接受而已、英法兩國政府當然須需長時間之考慮、而後始能決定覆文之是否滿意也、（十五日路透電）</p>

<p>［巴黎］此間與論與倫敦相同、以爲法英兩國互相諮商之後、當再以公文送達柏林、今晨英國報紙提出建議、謂英國可與德國單獨談話一次、此議英國政府即使予以授受、德國雖表示贊同、而法英兩國亦當以新公文送達柏林、兩國關於德國復文之談判、大約將於星期一日經由外交機關進行、法國政府定於星期二日舉行國務會議、英國閣議亦將於星期三日舉行、藉以決定兩國政府之立塲、自是而後、兩國談判即將進入活動階段云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>外交新談判啟其端</p>
<p>已使時局稍見進步</p>
<p>［倫敦］今日報紙對德國致英法之覆文、頗多批評、皆謂覆文空泛而無具體提議、所可歡迎者、爲德國宣佈贊成和平反對武裝耳、泰晤士報稱、英法建議咸已爲德國所接受、認爲外交新談判之起點、故此覆文在其初步答覆之性質中、乃準備談判之表示、每日電聞稱、德國未迎合英法之意志、但至少亦無慍色、覆文已使時局稍有進步、不過未如英法計畫初宣佈時預料之佳也、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］德國對於英法倫敦宣言書之覆文所引起之印象、顯然不佳、一般人以爲英法兩國有立即舉行磋商之必要、蓋英國內閣以爲二月三日倫敦宣言書內所決定之英法兩國意見一致、仍當與以保持、以後致德國之答覆、當俟英法兩國互徵同意後方可決定、抑此項答覆實屬必要、蓋德國覆文並非表示不接受、而係故意含混其辭、德國對於保障奧國獨立公約東歐互公約、暨德國重返國聯會問題、究具何種意向、一般人期望有明白之認識、且一般人以爲二月三日倫敦宣言書所提議各節、均互相聯帶不可分離、即天空公約亦然、如倫敦宣言書之其他部分未經接受、則天空公約亦無由訂立、惟英國方面意見、以爲各項提議雖屬互相連貫、然關於天空公約及其他各點、固亦不妨分別進行交換意見、關於東歐公約則以爲別進行交換意見、關於東歐公約則以爲各簽約國倘在實質上凖備相互援助、則該公約起草及施行之方式、亦不妨由關係國相互討論、略予通融、但當以貫徹東歐公約原來目的、爲其必要條件耳、又德國覆文中、責備各戰勝國不履行凡爾賽條約所規定縮減軍備之一節、此間人士多加以嚴厲之批評、蓋英法兩國宣言書內曾再三審慎、避免提及德國破壞凡爾賽條約秘密擴張軍備之一事、德國乃竟反唇相譏、可謂不智之甚、對於德國覆文作如何答復、大概將由英法兩國就外交途徑、立即舉行談判、談判結果、倘認爲英國派一閣員赴德係屬有益、則奉命前往柏林者或當係掌璽大臣艾登、惟在目前則一切均無法加以推測耳、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>認談判前途多艱</p>
<p>但諒解之門未閉</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間預料英法政府商榷後、不日即將共同答覆德國來電、法某要人今日在此語路透訪員曰、吾人態度極爲沉靜、假設德國來牒言及東歐或中歐公約、而不僅談天空公約、則尤可歡迎、但德國或以爲關於東歐公約興羅馬約定、刻正在進行中、故來牒無須涉及之也云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］此間負責方面人士圣於德國答覆英法倫敦提議之照會、並不甚爲驚異、以爲德國覆文、縱不能謂爲已表示同意、至少並未關閉未來諒解之門戶、蓋欲求未來之諒解、必經過長時間之談判、此種談判又必極爲艱難、今不過初具端倪而已、德國對於倫敦宣言書所提出之各項問題、均未加以注意、而對於訂結天空公約一事、則獨加以重視、認爲天空公約、其意即在準許德國設置空軍、此則頗可注目者也、德國覆文中、對於金瑙河公約、（即中歐保障奧國獨立公約）及東歐互助公約兩事、均不提隻字、殆因德國曾於二月初向法意兩國要求對於多瑙河公約作詳細之解釋、且法國亦曾於本年一月間照會德國政府、答覆去年九月十日德國所提出關於東歐互助公約之備忘錄、德國對法國此項照會、須另行答覆、故在此次致英法之覆文內、兩事均未提及也、此外德國覆文內未提及國聯會、亦頗爲此間負責人士所注目、大概德國政府認爲兩年以來、德國對于國聯會所採取之立塲、已十分明顯、不必再行說明、茍然、則德國重返國聯會之問題、是否當俟其他問題獲得解決後、方可作最後之決定、殊成一疑問矣、要之各項問題應同時舉行談判、不可分離、此爲倫敦宣言書之基本原則、德國復文對于此種基本原則、不表示意見、其故何在、雖令人不解、然英法兩國政府固當堅決維持倫敦宣言書之原則及文字而始終不變也、又按照倫敦宣言書、須先行簽訂一般限制軍備公約、與東歐及多瑙河公約同時訂立、方可用以替代凡爾賽條約第五部分之軍備條欵、對于訂結此項一般限制軍備公約之可能、德國復文亦避免表示意見、且尤有足以注意者、則德國復文暗中表明德國重整軍備之政策所根據之理由、由於軍備強大之國家未遵照凡爾賽條約之規定而實行縮減軍備、則當知英法美意德五國政府於一九三二年十二月十一日所作宣言中、明白規定逐步縮減軍備之辦法、向爲德國政府要人所承認、且一九三三年十月德國宣佈退出國聯會時、英法美三國亦曾提出逐步縮減軍備之計畫、可見德國之所指責、殊與事實不符、此外德國照會中所建議由英德兩國政府領袖舉行非正式談話一節、如此種程序足以謀各項懸案解決之便利、則自當爲法國政府所慶幸、總之、昨日德政府送交英法駐德大使之照會、須經巴黎倫敦會同作縝密之研究後、方可繼續進行談判也、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>京訊、交通部長朱家驊、今（十五）日下午六時存中央廣播電臺講演	「今年進行中之交通事業、」原詞照錄如下、</p>
<p>中央廣播電臺去年就要我來講我國交通事業概況、直到今天才有時間、鄙人於二十一年冬季到交通部、以爲交通事業是與國家生存、人民生活、有極大的關係、自然不能採取保守或縮小範圍的政策、但迫於經濟關係、只得先設法維持現狀、所以即從整理內部著手、例如整飭員工紀綱、實施會計獨立、統一電政內部、更立郵電合併的基礎、裁撤航政登記所、緊縮郵電各機關及招商局、與歐亞中國兩航空公司用人行政等等、務使各項業務商業化、行政鹽督務使嚴密迅速、以漸國事業之發展、現在郵政方面的難關已經過去了、內部紀律也逐漸恢復了、二十二年度的決算、且有一百二十餘萬之盈餘、倘再將撥與民用航空的經費一併計算、尚不止此數、與以前郵政全盛時代相較、已無遜色、不過從前的虧負、還要逐漸填補、民信局取締以後、郵政從此真正統一了電政方面、兩年來也已經整理出一個眉目來、同時也有相當的進步、不過經濟基礎本來太差、現在一切大小舊債、雖均已整理就緒、因爲又要擔負清還舊債的本利、所以目前尚無餘力從事較大的擴充、至於航政方面的招商局、營業成績、較有進步、惟以種種關係、目前尚多困難、民用航空方面、歐亞中國民航空公司、以擴充航綫、撙節開支、曾遠到收支適合程度、中國航空公司現更日見起色、現當二十四年開始的時候、姑且約取今年預定要辦的事業、簡略的來說說、同時爲明瞭一事的經過情形、不免連帶說到以前去、</p>
<p>（甲）郵政</p>

<p>發表談話</p>
<p>顏氏昨日下午、在國際飯店、接見各記者晤談、據云、本人以前出國二年餘、回國料理私事、并視察國內情形、嗣因身體不適、未能早日返任、近來身體已漸復原、本人原不擬再行返任、但念及中俄復交事完全由本人在國聯與李維諾夫所晤商、待復交實現後、應命爲第一任駐俄大使、爲時僅年餘、今驟缷職、似於人情上說不過去、且同時政府方面、亦以一時不易物色繼任人選、而蘇俄方面使館人員等、亦均希望余返任、因乃決計重返原任、</p>
<p>邦交密切</p>
<p>顏氏繼謂中俄復交後、雙方往來甚密切、非特文化上、我國常有軍事交通敎育市政武官等團體前往視察、即商業方面、亦甚進步、本人近聞蘇俄現定購華茶四千噸、而俄國煤木等等之進口、亦爲兩國邦交上之一種良好現象、此次俄國邀請梅蘭芳等前往表演、則更足使中俄兩國文化之發展、故本人此行、頗感愉快、至華茶各商、渠頗希望其能聯合起來、則於國際貿易上、較爲有力、</p>
<p>中俄外交</p>
<p>關於中俄外交、顏氏謂、中東路問題、我國本來反對、歷次均有抗議、中俄商約、在京進行、大約俄大使回任後、可繼續進行、</p>
<p>國際情形</p>
<p>顏氏末謂、赴新疆之舉、盛世才督辦曾一度邀本人前往、但事實上不可能、將來抵俄後、有機會擬一往、中日關係及廣田演說、須看舉動如何、此事我國爲被動的、須日本自覺、其第一步工作、須先使空氣轉好、九一八之前、兩國本甚好、故改善中日之關係、不使其長此僵持、亦須先明其因果、至英美合作、在語言宗敎經濟種族以及歷史種種關係方面言之、均有其可能、但範圍未免太廣、兩國在遠東之利益、當然維持、即如美使所發表之談話、英國對遠東政策未變、此即表示其擁護其向來之主張也、但吾人不能希望借他人以爲援助、此觀念實爲不可能之事、亦非獨立國家所應存之意想、李頓爵士爲一熱心之人、所發表之言論、亦不過維持渠調查報告上之主張耳、故李氏在英時、對於關東北之事、頗注意以表示其始終擁護其報告云、</p>

<p>三月五日起實行</p>
<p>國營招商局、與各鐵路簽訂水陸聯運、業已次第實行、商辦江南鐵路公司京蕪路聯運、自經周鳳圖君與江南公司簽立聯運細則後、茲又更進一步、已將聯運運費議妥、江南鐵路公司特派車務股周股長來滬、與同局恊議簽定聯運實施日期、昨日已經決定、三月五日起實行聯運、茲將詳情分述如下、</p>
<p>聯運地點</p>
<p>招商局與江南鐵路公司議定聯運地點、屬於鐵路方而之陸運地者、爲蕪湖之東門·卡子口·竹絲莊·繆家莊·灣沚·蕭桿·汪家·宣城·及孫家埠·等九站、以後如路軌延長、則隨時通知、屬於水道之聯運處、由招商局輸承載者、則爲漢口·九江·大通·安慶·鎮江·煙臺·天津·寧波·汕頭·廣東·與上海·等十一個口岸、（京蕪通車前南京亦在內）</p>
<p>實施日期</p>
<p>江南鐵路公司運輸貨物、大都爲農產品、蕪湖出產菜子與雜糧爲最大宗、宣城出品爲名聞全國之紙頭、尚未運往各地、全特內地之帆船、費巨而稽延時、日商幫之往採辦貨物者、周折困難、耗資費時、今江南鐵道造成、將昔日艱阻、一旦刻除、不特運輸速快、更可辦理押匯、於經濟上·生產上·均有莫大之利益·此次水陸聯運辦成、既可挽回外輸竸運之漏巵、更能減節運輸之費用、已定於三月五日起、上海與蕪湖兩處、路航同時實行、</p>
<p>運率低廉</p>
<p>招商局聯運主任周鳳圖、爲此事經數月之磋商、費盡心血與路局車務股商聯運運費、處處以體諒貨主、將運價減輕、各貨運率、業經訂定、大致分爲整車與另擔兩項、整車則以十與十六公噸爲一車之單位、詳細價目、另有「太利夫」、可向路局與招商局聯運股、或各車站各分局索閱、裝運貨車、分作六聯、手續非常慎重、付繳聯運運費、已議定分作兩種、一爲先付、一係貨到時繳納、均可憑客自便</p>
<p>貫通首都</p>
<p>京蕪路已經竣工者、爲蕪湖東門到孫家埠一段、一面向南京者、今亦將鐵道路軌、接通至首都、據車務討周股長、昨對記者言、南京城內之小火車、已經江南鐵路與之租定、期爲二十年、現京蕪段正在積極施工、謀將路軌與南京小火車路接通、惟因啣接之處、有城牆及民房之阻隔、公司正在進行收買拆缷、改鋪軌道、在三月內可先到達南京城外、至五月內、始將與首都鐵路啣接、實行通車以後、京蕪路貫通後、皖貨下運、尤爲便利、</p>
<p>挽回航權</p>
<p>向來皖貨運輸、長江綫內、洋商各輸營業甚巨、其中轉口到南北洋各埠者、尤以英日各輓占優勢、今江南鐵路與招商局聯運後、皖貨之裝赴南北洋者、將奪洋商之營業、而改裝國輪、無形中挽回航權頗巨、本埠洋商各輸公司、得聞二月五日竤行聯運消息、乃欲先發制人、業將皖貨之運往南洋各埠者已經跌減十分之二、藉以竸爭、而謀挽救云、</p>

<p>原告新近購股被告駁爲無權過問</p>
<p>關於程序部份昨已訊結聽候宣判</p>
<p>華商證券交易所理事長張慰如及該所常務理事尹韻笙·沈長賡、因共同處理該所業務、不能取信於股東粵人鄺野夫、經鄺致函詰問、而張等則以鄺係新股東、無權顧問舊事、覆函相駁、但鄺非特不甘放棄股東職權、默爾而息、且更爲進一步之行動、搜集證據、對張·尹·沈·三人向第一特區地方法院提起刑事自訴、請求治該被告以朋比營私背信侵占之罪、臚列重大</p>
<p>舞弊事項</p>
<p>五欵、（一）假設理事長交際名目、侵占三萬六千元、其說明謂理事長於十九年間除按月支用交際費五百元外、復矇蔽要求少數理事議決於營業費項下、加支交際費三萬六千元之鉅、查交際費既有定額、豈能額外加支、該被告等委因浪費虧空、不得不假設名目、以資彌補、其實爲侵蝕之化名、毫無疑義、（二）侵吞捐助中央黨部建築費一萬元、查二十年營業費項下、付出捐助</p>
<p>中央黨部</p>
<p>建築費一萬元、實際上中央黨部並未收到此欵、而爲該被告等侵占朋分、無庸諱言、（三）將本所庫存有價證券之保管據抵押十二萬元、私擅化用、二十年七月間、由張慰如盜出本所交與交通銀行保管之一九善後庫券二十五萬元之保管收據、向益昌錢莊抵押洋十二萬元化用、迨九一八事變後、設法揑造開支、始行贖回、（四）侵占四明銀行支票十七萬元、二十年下半年、該被告等在本所取去</p>
<p>四明銀行</p>
<p>支票兩紙一爲十二萬元一爲五萬元始終不明其係何用途、勢必爲該三人共同朋分、否則決無如此鉅欵、彼此均不過問之理、（五）申同撏付新所址建築費十七萬元、本年前因建築現用新屋、係由陳永興營造廠投標承攬、先後所付之欵、均有該營造廠印板正式收據可憑、惟二十年九月間所付之十七萬元、當時並未取得、該廠正式收據、串通侵吞、情跡顯然、綜上五欵、共計侵蝕五十萬零六千元、此尚不過爲自訴人所已知者、</p>
<p>其不知者</p>
<p>究有幾何、猶未敢斷言也、故請求將該被告等拘提到案、盡律重懲外、並附帶民訴、請再判令該被告等連帶將所侵蝕之五十萬零六千元、如數返還、以維股權云云、昨日午後、由第一特院姜樹滋推事開庭傳審、被告張慰如以赴京公幹、祇尹韻笙·沈長賡·兩人投案、姜推事即向自訴人鄺野夫訊間起訴意旨、據供彼有華商證券交易所股份五股、係於去年十二月間購得、茲因查悉被告等有</p>
<p>朋比爲奸</p>
<p>勾串舞弊情事、爲整個公司之利益起見、特行提起控訴、此際被告之辯護律師吳麟坤·王黼裳·秦聯奎·章士釗·陳暎·即提出訴權問題、要求駁回原告之自訴、姜推事亦覺本案能否提起自訴、於訴訟程序上、確尚有問題、遂決定將本案事實暫置綏議、命令兩造律師、先就程序一點、開始辯論、以憑核奪、遂由原告之律師王鑑首述提起、</p>
<p>自訴理由</p>
<p>次引法律上之根據、末更援收回租界法權設立中國法院所訂恊定之條文、謂本案情形、對於該被告等殊無須依照普通舉發刑事罪犯之例而得以依據恊定第五欵提起自訴云云、繼由爲三被告辯護之各律師次第辯駁、謂原告自訴、雖云根據恊定、但究應受刑訴法之拘束、須直接受害者、</p>
<p>方得自訴</p>
<p>今原告所訴內容、皆係十九年二十年之事、而其股份則甫於二十三年十二月購得、尚非直接被害者、況其僅有五股、尤不夠爲股東代表資格、查舊公司早經解散、現在之新公司始於去年四月間、經部註冊、原告縱欲主張權利、然亦祇能溯及註冊日止、如必欲繼承其股利、更應先向民庭提起確認股權之訴茲乃逕提刑訴、實不合法、請即駁斥云云、庭上旋諭關於程序部份辯論終結、候十九日下午宣判、</p>

<p>工部局衛生處長之報告有云、一般居民、對於瘋犬癥之防止、毫不注意、殊屬可憂、上年之經注射者、雖已用重劑、而效果殊難滿意、求診者往往不俟注射程序完畢、即絕跡不來、此輩多係勞力分子、雖向之陳說、必需注射完畢之重要、而難於見聽也、</p>
<p>上年發見患癥之犬、數目頗增、一般公衆、對於犬帶口套一舉、殊鮮遵行、且又攜犬入鄉間、多冒染患之危險、此習不改、則瘋犬癥殊無法防止、至貓亦能染患此癥、彼時危險更大、</p>
<p>人類被毒後之注射、雖經完畢手續、亦不能斷定不發、而目今除注射外、亦更無其他挽救之法、故最要之著、厥爲先事預防、勿使染患、</p>
<p>所可惜者、即在智識階級、亦尚不知犬類染患此癥之易易、即有染患者、而其主人又每每絕對否認、一蓋　其愛犬真被證明染患瘋癥、其主人之名譽地位、即將爲之失墜然、</p>
<p>衛生處上年曾特由巴黎之巴斯德學院、購取注射原料、因其力量較強、現又將關於瘋犬癥之小冊子、重新編印、以期喚醒居民之注意、衛生處之意見、以爲三個市區、應即擬定合作辦法、將不帶口套之犬、一概捕捉消滅、爲社會計、寗可剷除貓狗、不應以人命爲兒戲、故應破除情面、依理智而行也、</p>

<p>下午三時在申園足球塲</p>
<p>昨日法商九比零大勝華捕</p>
<p>史高塔杯複賽、昨日法商既以九比零大勝華捕、已得決賽資格、另一幕爲東華對臘克斯、則定今日下午三時在申園舉行、以爭與法商之決賽權、查東華臘克斯兩隊、人材濟濟、實力強勁、甲組聯賽中東華尚未失敗、䐉克斯之地位、雖不如東華但爲西人隊中之最強者、實爲東華這大敵、今番相遇、必有劇烈竸爭、今日秩序如下、</p>
<p>東華封臘克斯　史高塔杯　申園　李諾斯</p>
<p>（巡邊昌沈惠春培爾）</p>
<p>西捕對猶太隊　甲組　跑馬廳　那愛脫</p>
<p>西商對英尼斯　甲組　跑馬廳　勃　脫</p>
<p>東華通告云、今日東華對臘克作施高塔杯賽於申園、東華出塲陣綫如後、</p>
<p>陸鍾恩　李　寧　關洵安　顧尚勷　馮運佑　丁兆成　萬象華　李義臣　戴麟經　陳家球　賈幼良</p>
<p>史高塔杯複賽、法商對華捕之戰、昨日在逸圍舉行、結果法商以九以對零淘汰華捕、得決賽權、將與今日東華臘克斯之勝者決賽、</p>
<p>實力究竟不如</p>
<p>華捕自一對零淘汰西商後、一鳴驚人、頗有刮目相看之概、新春在京、又以四對一勝京華、然昨日與法商對敵、實力究竟相去尚遠、亦無可如何之事、然假以時日、恐非凡品也、</p>
<p>五位埠際大將</p>
<p>法商昨日前鋒中、加入大將一員、即柯拉沙是也、因此實力頓時大增、攻勢殊烈、將來倘與東華決賽、大有可觀、昨日法商共有埠際大將五員、即柯拉沙·法凡笑·雷米迪·馬山兒·華特、難怪華捕不敵矣、</p>
<p>相持達念分鐘</p>
<p>最初軍相持不下者、達二十分鐘之久、華捕銳氣方盛、腿勁甚佳、東奔西跑、活動非凡、有時亦居然進攻法商之門、法商一時有無可奈何之勢、華捕開球、法商琴生帶球直進、苗華國撩出、吳錫泉數次沿邊攻擊、以力弱收效甚微、法商漸漸反佔攻勢、但華捕堅璧高壘、法商始終不能越雷池一步、苦守至二十分鐘時、鮑休脫斜裹一腳、從此將華補鐵門打破、</p>
<p>上半時四時零</p>
<p>鮑休脫一腳後、形勢從此大變、董兆斌在罰球綫外之任意球未得中後、雷米迪橫裹飛來、鮑休脫又一頂而中、尹杏生拾而復失、小董特輕輕棧進、成三對零、法凡笑亦中、上半時法商以四比零佔先、</p>
<p>下半時五對零</p>
<p>如此一來、華捕完全瓦解、下半時開球後之第一分鐘、柯拉沙拉起自攻、球從門上彈下未進、法凡笑被絆、雷米迪中十二碼成五比零、法捕已成法商掌中之物、笑話百出、法罔笑大爲賣力中第六、柯拉沙第七球、琴生第八球、法凡笑中最後第九球、華捕打不破鴨蛋、力不足、無可奈何事也、</p>
<p>法商</p>
<p>華特　馬山兒　大華特　派克　尼格洛夫電述　小華特　鮑休脫　柯拉沙　法凡笑　琴　生</p>
<p>華捕</p>
<p>尹吉生　馬乘璋　薛志文　朱貴奎　苗華國　張子權　錢祖滋　廖中乾　董兆斌　邱天生　吳錫泉</p>

<p>甲組兩江崇德相繼退出</p>
<p>僅暨南東南兩隊爭勝負</p>
<p>上海籃球會今晚女子甲乙兩組、在申園開始比賽、屆時當有一番新氣象、惟兩江崇德兩隊、因故退出、致甲組僅由暨南與東南兩隊競技、改用三賽二勝定勝負、今晚除二塲女子賽外、尚有真如對鷹隊、及梁溪對慕爾兩幕補賽、茲將四塲秩序列左、</p>
<p>華東對東南　　女乙　　六時三十分　陸翔千</p>
<p>東南對暨南　　女甲　　七時二十分　張元生</p>
<p>真如對應隊　　甲甲　　八時十分　　邵樂平</p>
<p>梁溪對慕爾　　乙一　　九時十分　　王亦樵</p>
<p>（註）光華女子退出所有對該隊之賽一律取消</p>
<p>昨晚上海籃球會僅有兩塲比賽、乙一組藥光以二十一對十四勝慕爾、甲乙組大同對青光、雙方雖無錦標得失之爭、亦有名次先後之別、故爭扎頗烈、一路戰來、極呈清晰、比數大同領導前行、青光諸將緊緊迫隨、惟談董等雖有往昔氣概、確無當年咸風、不免有心餘力絀之感焉、結果大同以三七對二十勝青光、</p>

<p>優游甲乙兩足球隊、昨日分別出塲、甲組在申園與沙谷爾作甲組賽、乙隊則在虹口公園與東華乙作字林杯第三次重賽、結果一以六比一大勝、一以三比零奏凱、勝利雙收、皆大歡喜、茲分誌經過如下、</p>
<p>甲隊勝沙谷爾</p>
<p>優游甲隊養精蓄銳者已久、個個精強力壯、生氣勃勃、昨與沙谷爾作甲組賽於申園、操縱全局、沙谷爾無奈何、結果六比一、優游大勝、甲組各隊成績如下、</p>
<p>連中三元</p>
<p>竸爭形勢、頗有可觀、優游攻勢極盛、沙谷爾亦不示弱、相持久之、周紹文首探龍門、一舉成功、沙谷爾幾度進攻、均不得利、此後孫錦順又中一球、羅海光心雄萬夫、亦建一功、上半時三比零、優游全勝、沙谷爾一籌莫展、</p>
<p>造就半打</p>
<p>休息之後、沙谷爾力圖收復失地、形勢益見緊張、優游乘勝餘威、不稍讓步、前鋒頗能聯絡孫鐵腿再中鵠的、四比零遙佔上風、沙谷爾積極反攻、卒由諾斯登夫打破鴨紀録、而羅海光鍾勇森又先建功、結果六比一鳴金收軍、兩隊陣綫如下、</p>
<p>乙隊克服東華</p>
<p>西聯足球會字林盃賽中之東華優游兩乙隊、賽力平均、一旦相遇、誠可謂棋逢敵手、將遇良才、故激戰兩次、勝負不分、乃於昨日下午三時在虹口第一球塲舉行第三次重賽、東華因大部健將承青年隊征杭、實力銳減、交綏結果、以三對零受挫、</p>
<p>銀笛聲起</p>
<p>東華開球先攻、祇見五前鋒作一字式相輔而進、縱橫敵陣、苦無機會、徒勞而無獲、約一刻鐘時、優游許文奎興兵來犯、破關斬將、聲勢洶湧、幾下傳遞、球已到達門前由文奎對門力射、球從左下角而進、優游既勝一球、士氣益甚、東華門前幾全爲優游之世界、反順東華則不能越雷池一步、</p>
<p>易地再戰</p>
<p>來華奮勇、冀圖最後勝利、衝鋒陷陣、銳不可當、惟前鋒不聯絡、射門欠準確、致未能得心應手、一次東華內衛陳公與在罰球區城內、非法撞人、被罰十二碼、由許文奎主踢、急而且準、守門瞠目視之、望球興嘆、優游繼續進窺、始終不懈、奚巧生驍勇過人、截得石金生之來球、匹馬單槍、在二十碼處傳命中、成三比零、此後彼此往返、絕少驚險之處、長笛一鳴、一塲難解之球賽、就此解決矣、</p>

<p>青年隊定廿四日前往</p>

<p>贊同宣言原則並提出基本工作</p>
<p>第一步啓蒙運動應從敎育著手</p>
<p>上海市敎育局長潘公展氏、於昨日下午二時半、在中華學藝社演講、到各校敎職員五百餘人、講題爲「中國本位的文化建設啓蒙運動、」除對十敎授發表之中國本位文化建設宣言詳細說明外、並供獻文化建設之基本工作、講詞甚長、茲摘錄其大意如下、潘氏首對一十宣言之原則表示贊同、次謂要建設之基本工作、打破目前的蒙味糊塗的現象、做了第一步工作、然後可以做第二步工作、如第一步啓蒙工作不做、建設文化根本辦不到、而負此啓蒙工作責任的、先在敎育界人士、芰文化者是人類一切生活方式生活形熊的緩和、是無所不包無所不用的、文化不是少數人可以建設、尤其不是一二人可建設、固然先要靠先知先覺者提倡、而後靠後知後覺者宣傳、但必須要大多數人能照這生活方式來模仿、而後可以做到建設文化、所謂文化文即是文明、化是變化和溶化、要變化和深化到趨向於文明、即是文化、故文化即文明化、但化一定要普遍、不普遍不能算化、所以建設文化第一步工作要要多數人民能接收這種生活方式、照這生活方式來做、就非靠啓蒙運動不可、所謂啓蒙、換句話說即是普及敎育運動、建設文化必須從敎育著手、離開敎育不能談建設文化、敎育意義分兩方面、一方面是思想的指導、使精神生活美滿、一方面是技能的訓練、使物質生活進步、前者是識字敎育、後者是生產敎育、兩者能兼顧不偏、才算完全敎育、能普及此種敎育才能使人民能接收新的生活方式、故建設文化啓蒙運動的基厯礎、是敎育界云云、</p>

<p>（二）唐壽民</p>
<p>（二）忠實服務諸君應爲機關做事、不可爲個人做事、更應以服務機關爲各國人終身事業、忠實的做下去、不可思想活動、或東或西、本行招諸君來的目的、爲造就銀行健全人才、假如造就以後、即向別方活動、結果將使社會上各機關各行商、不願微用大學畢業生了、我希望諸君不作如是想法、如果不幸有此種思想、應該早些覺司、</p>
<p>（三）有責任心諸君都是大學或專門學院出身、對於責任心、當然是非常明白、就是事前不推諉、事後不缷責、說了就做、做了再說、凡有交辦事項、應切實負責辦理、並於最短期內、迅速辦妥、</p>
<p>（四）合作精神　諸君既已抱定決心服務於此、不僅要有責任心、有忍耐心、並且應有共同合作精神、尤其在機關範圍較大情形之下、更應將合作精神、盡量發揮、譬如放欵課人員工作有誤時、會計課人員應該留意、細心核算、發現錯誤時、即應通力合作、不分彼此、免得整個機關遭受損失、</p>
<p>（五）謙誠待人　公司商號以貨物爲買賣之標的、金融機關既不是賣銀洋、又不是賣鈔票、所賣的是「個—服務、」你們應該殷勤謙恭來招待顧客、普通一般人、都覺得銀行裹人、自視地位高太、志高氣傲、尤其對於幾個老大銀行、有許多人真不敢進門、他們雖有存欵、亦不敢來存放、這種不良習氣、影蠁銀行很大、請你們特別注意、</p>
<p>（六）服務勤慎現代銀行最應注意的、是對於顧客服務週到、尤其是要注意「櫃臺服務、」本行與各大銀行地位相仿、只要我們的服務好、不傲慢、不騙矜、就可以勝過人家、說話要真實、待人要誠懇、我前在上海銀行當副經理的時候、爲督率固人起見、曾提倡一件事、就是「副經理亦坐在櫃臺內、」結果、同人既特別勤慎服務、復沒有驕矜態度、那時頗受顧客之歡迎、并受社會之贊許、最好付欵人、一方面付欵、一方面爲免除顧客寂寞起見、與之談天、發生好感、如以驕矜態度對人、那就無論登了多少廣告、也無用的、</p>
<p>（七）從事研究服務應不忘讀書、公餘之暇、再隨時閱覽關於銀行方面的書籍、才能補充學識、增長經騐、發揮自已的能力、對於一切不知道的銀行實務、都應從事研究、請敎有經騐者指導、處處虛心、不可主觀太探、更不可過於自滿、將研究所得、隨時在通訊內發表、</p>
<p>（八）不受同化　各人有各人的思想和特長、能將這種特長盡量貢獻、機關不無蒸蒸日上、諸君有好的意見貢獻、本人非常歡迎、在可能範圍內、無不採納的、最不好的自已沒有好的建議、而對於別人的建議猜忌毀謗、結果、大家不說話、大家不願爲整個機關求進步、求發展、大家腐化、毫無生氣、假如有這種有習氣的人、諸位應該同化他們、不應爲他們所同化、</p>
<p>再次、關於本行內人待遇問題、亦乘此機會談談、社會上有很多機關商號、除郵政海關外、都不及銀行來得優待、諸君能將能力充份表現、隨時可以增加薪水、往年習慣、每年年終各分支行經副理爲同人請求加薪、辦事精幹得力者如是、處事懶惰無能力者亦如是、譬如、某行有同人三十名、二十餘人都能進級、其餘數人爲情面關係、亦加以進級、結果、考績等於零、徒然每年增加開支、且使賣力者之辦事效率、無形減少、良可慨嘆、故我去年曾將同人薪水小者大者重行核定、此後主管人員說他辦事得力、他便可隨時加薪、「天天有加、刻刻有加、」這完全看你們能力如何賣力如何、爲進級的標凖、爲加薪的辦法、至於獎勵金一節、從前無論成績如何、一律照薪額支配、這種辦法、實失去獎勵、之本旨、今後賞實行獎勵、服務優異者、可以多得、如考核不好者、或有過失、或請假過多、竟可完全沒有也說不定、</p>
<p>再有一點、諸君要明白的、就是將來機關分設、調遣時無論遠近、總得遵調前往、經過各處調動後、即有機會明瞭各地金融經濟狀況、便可造就全國全融人才、這是我非常希望的、</p>
<p>最後諸位中研究的科學、各有不同、有的專門會計的、經濟的、農業的、紡織的等等、凡研究會計的、已派在稽核處、在不久的將來、要添辦一班會計訓練班、其目的在使你們「由傳票至決算、」都能完全明瞭、訓練以後、派往各分支行擔任會計、同時將原有會計人員、調回總行、擔任稽核工作、其派在業務部者、亦擬用實習辦事方法、由原經辦者起立在旁指導、俟實習純熟後、再將原有人員調開、總使全體同人、益致健全、到處可以應用、他如紡織學校出身者、可派往各紗廠實習、其他專門人員、尚盼各位安心做事、還有一點要記得的、就是知過即改、不要受不良之同化作用、努力前進、庶不負造就各位的本意、（完）</p>

<p>— 紅霞</p>
<p>我們走到街頭巷尾，我們可以看見：許多拖鼻涕，穿著破衣裳的孩子們，在那兒跳著跑著，打著鬧著。</p>
<p>當一個挾著書包的小孩子，興高彩烈的走過去時，他們會帶著羨慕的視缐不住的瞧，一方面好像帶著怨恨似的，深深的嘆一口氣。</p>
<p>在酷熱的日光下，在寒冷的氛圍裹，許多正在學齡的兒童，提著燒餅油條，瓜子花生在呌賣，一陣陣的呌賣聲，打進人們的心坎裹，酸溜溜的。</p>
<p>他們難道都是天生的苦命嗎？他們之中，也有很多希望讀書，希求學的，然而，社會的環境，生活的逼迫，不允許他們去發展他們的本能。</p>
<p>今年是兒童年，希望國內有志的人們，趕快設法來救一救這般可憐的苦孩子，也許將來救國的中堅份子，就在這一羣苦孩子裹面哩！</p>

<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>晉代裴秀，苦聲力學，八歲能文，友人誇費了說：「後俊領袖有裴秀」，領袖是不平凡的意思，小朋友，你如果立志要做個不平凡的人，將來做些不平凡的事業，就要少小努力，免得老大傷悲。</p>
<p>南北朝徐陵，幼年喜歡看史籍，也同裴秀一樣，八歲能文，十三歲通老子莊子，他讀書很多，記下來的「古典」不在少數，所以他做出來的文章，差不多句句都引用「古典」的，呌做六朝文，與庚信齋名，時稱爲徐庚體，流傳至今；現在時代不同，小朋友固然不必在古書上專爲求「古典」，但是一切的常識，究竟在心得上有幾何呢？趕快努力吧！</p>
<p>唐代李賀，七歲能詞章，當時有韓愈和皇甫湜兩位大文學家，不相信這話，以爲七歲的小孩子，怎麼就會能爲「詩人」？恐是人家代筆冒充的吧了。兩人到李賀家裹去，當面看李賀做詩，李賀援筆立成，那首詩的題目，名呌高軒過，韓愈和皇甫湜看了大驚，說是「難能可貴」，小朋友，你的作品有人看到呌好麼？若是不好，就要發憤練習，纔會漸漸的好起來，若不這樣，光陰易過，就容易由小朋友一變，變成個大朋友了，還是語句不通，連篇別字，不要被人恥笑嗎？由小看大，可不要把這「黃金時代」錯過了。</p>

<p>— 真</p>
<p>天氣漸漸的冷了，學校裹便放了二十多天的寒假，西北風在呼呼的怒吼，一陣陣刮在禿枯的樹枝上。</p>
<p>平兒不得不躱在家裹消寒。在家裹是怪悶氣的，正要想在家裹做些什麼工作。恰巧他的哥哥—建兒從外面進來說：「你學校裹的先生剛才來過，對爸爸說：「你對於自然科學不十分好」。所以爸爸呌我來敎你」。</p>
<p>平兒聽了低著頭，覺得很慚愧。建兒便說道：「用不著慚愧，祇要你自已努好了。你有不懂的地方，儘管來問我」。平兒便到書架裹去拿一本他曾經讀過的自然書，便問道：「哥哥！先生說地球是橢圓形的，我很有些疑惑」。</p>
<p>『我國古時都是這樣說：「天圓地方」。就是西方古代也是有這樣的相信。自希臘大哲學家亞黎斯都德說：「在月蝕的時候，地球的影子映在月球上。它的邊是曲缐，可知地球是圓的」。埃及天文學家托勒密也說：「進港的船，先看見船橋，然後看見船身。出港的船，先看見全船，漸漸的不見」。還有冒險家哥侖布，麥哲倫等發見新大陸，這些都是證明地圓的鐵證。</p>
<p>十七八世紀之中，英國博士家牛頓利用離心力的方法，推測地球在從前是液體，它的赤道部必定因爲旋轉而澎漲，兩極因旋轉而扁平，纔知地球是扁平橢圓形，不是渾圓像皮球一樣的』。建兒很緊張的告訴他的弟弟，平兒便一句句的牢記在心頭。</p>

<p>光陰過得真快，一眨眼已過了寒假的季節，又要用心去讀書了。可是過於勞心，身體也有妨礙的，最好用了一回腦以後，再來遊戲一下，來調和久不運動的身體，搶羊，就是最好的玩意。</p>
<p>搶羊須有十個小孩子纔可組織（至少也要五六個小孩子），今天假定十個小孩小，九人充當羊子，依長短身體而挨次序，最長的當頭，次長的牽著當頭的身後衣襟，兩手牽牢，不可脫手，以下類推。搶羊者，立者當羊頭前面。當羊頭的好比是一隻老羊，後面的八人好比小羊。搶羊的人來搶小羊，老羊要保護小羊不要給人搶去，一面小羊要緊隨老羊身後逃避。</p>
<p>搶羊的見預備好了，呼著一，二，三，的口號就開始搶，在五分鐘以內，看能搶到多少羊？被捨的羊須另行住開。結束的時候，罰老羊和被搶去的羊，排列著獨腳跳一丈路，算懲戒老羊保護不週，小羊逃避不力。真正有趣哩！</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>古代的人類一到了冬天，他們沒有別的方法禦寒，只得躱在洞穴裹，披著獸皮，燒著木柴，使自已的身體溫暖，（一圖。）文明愈進步，禦寒的方法愈加完備，到了現代，人們一到了冬天，便在屋了裹裝起煤爐，電爐，熱水汀來、使空氣溫暖。（二圖）衣服的材料也有獸皮·呢·棉·毛絨綫等數種，這些都能夠保持體溫。（三圖）上面所講的是住在溫帶上的人們過冬的情形；那些寒帶上的人們的冬天生活卻又不同了：他們把雪磗堆成圈形·越到上面越小，頂上蓋一塊圓形的雪：磗和磗的中間，用散雪塞住，這樣，就成功一座不透風的可以過冬的屋子了。他們的衣服完全用獸皮製造。靴子也用長毛的皮製咸。（四圖）</p>
<p>小朋友們，我們在冬天，不是總怕麼？有什麼方法使自已的身體常常暖烘烘的呢？捧手爐，腳爐麼？那使你的手足容易生凍瘃；靠煤爐麼？那股煤氣也不衛生。裝電爐，熱水汀麼？價錢太貴了，並不是家家裝得起的·所以最好的方法是常常運動，運動作夠使得你在冬天也熱得出汗·</p>
<p>常運動，不怕風，方配做新時代的兒童！（五圖）</p>

<p>雪的成因水蒸氣，在天空中遇著冷，便成雨，雨未到地面，再遇更冷，便成「雪」；雪分一粒粒的呌做雪珠，一朶朶的呌做雪花，總稱呌「雪」</p>
<p>雪的性狀　雪色白，而質地輕鬆，他的形狀各各不同，很是美麗，有六角形，多角形等，（圖一）不過有時雪花，兩片互相合併；或到地面後，受相當的溫度，便能失去原來的形狀。</p>
<p>雪的遊戲　雪的遊戲有許多種類；什麼堆雪人呀！擲雪球呀！滾雪球呀！推雪撬呀！玩雪戰呀：等等，都是我們喜歡的遊戲。（圖二）</p>
<p>雪的利害　雪的益處：一，點綴景色：二，殺死害蟲和蟲卵，幫助農作物，所以農人希望冬季下雪，也是這個緣故：雪的害處：一，傷害植物的幼芽：二，雪下的太子了，能壓倒房屋，阻礙交通的。</p>

<p>— 任潮軍</p>
<p>小朋友！你們不是時常看報嗎？在每年的冬季裹，被煤氣毒死的人不是很多嗎？他們爲甚麼會死呢？主要的原因，他們用的爐子祇有二個口，並且睡的時候把窗門都關緊。因爲煤烯燒後能產生炭氣，這是一個很普通的學識。煤生了炭氣，就和原有的空氣中的養氣化合，就成了二氧化炭。但是屋中的養氣是有限的，加著睡著人的呼吸，這樣屋中的空氣都成了二氧化炭。然而炭氣繼續的生著，沒有養氣去化合，它祇能把屋中的二氧化炭化成了一氧化炭。人是照樣呼吸，他所吸入的是有毒的一氧化炭，一氧化炭既有毒並且有固凝性，它混入了血液，排去氣變成炭血色素，並且凝固著不會循環，人就死於非命。雖然有人說。水可以解毒，但是它祇能多加屋中的氧，卻不能永遠解毒，所以這是一個謬說。至於救濟的方法，最簡單是把爐子多開一孔，用一節煙囪把爐中的炭氣引到外面去。</p>
<p>小朋友，你們應當注意煤毒，並且要解釋給附近的鄰居和同學聽，使他們都知道煤毒的可怕和這種不確實的謬解。</p>

<p>海兒看見鄰居胡伯伯的哈叭狗身上穿著綿襖，他說：「胡伯伯很愛哈叭狗，怕它受冷，特爲做件綿襖給它穿著，我所愛的就是洋娃娃，像這樣的寒天，伊還赤裸裸的，難道人不如狗嗎？」尋著幾塊洋皮，要求母親做件皮衣給洋娃娃翻穿著，和外國小朋友裝飾一般。母親說：「玩具的洋娃娃，是無知覺的，用不著穿什麼皮衣，我們身上原有體溫，冬天穿了皮綿，衣服，使體溫不致外散，所以纔覺得溫暖，像那玩具的洋娃娃，是沒有體溫的，不穿衣，固不覺得寒，就穿了衣，也不覺得暖，用不著做了。」海兒說：「這種理由，即經解釋，我已明白，不過玩具，似乎應當要合時令，冬令是要穿衣的，爲何洋娃娃特別赤裸呢？那末只可作夏天玩具，不能作冬天玩具了，若是翻穿著皮襖，更覺有趣，還請你做好吧—母親說：「你可知道？去年旱災奇重，各地災民，饑寒交迫，無衣禦寒的，不知多少？你也有感動嗎？海兒說：「那麼這幾天長輩所有給我的壓歲錢和拜年錢，我都一起捐去救濟難民好不好？」線親大爲贊，並允他的要求，將洋娃娃的皮衣製成穿起來了。海兒看看洋娃娃翻穿了皮衣，因唱道：</p>
<p>「洋娃娃，穿皮衣，翻穿皮衣笑嘻嘻，災民號寒並啼饑，我願把我的一些錢來賬濟你。」</p>

<p>— 心青</p>
<p>我如今纔知道人們怎樣從這深谷中取那可貴的寶石的。我曾聽得過這種故事，卻不能信以爲真，直至我親眼瞧見了纔相信。</p>
<p>鷹有小鷹的時候，人們都到這所在來。他們立近那巉巖的邊上，拋下大塊的肉來。地上的寶石黏住在肉塊上，到得那些熱鳥取了肉飛到巖頂上的巢中時，人們就爬到巢外，嚇走了鳥取那寶石去。</p>
<p>我眼見了這麼一回事，就想到一個計畫，可以助我出此山谷，可是我已確知自已不能爬出去的了。</p>
<p>第一我先把那所能找到的寶石和所賸的食物都放在袋中。接著把裹頭的布將一大塊肉縛住在身上，將我的臉伏倒在地，那袋寶石便緊緊的擊在我的腰帶上稍停那許多鷹飛下來取食喂小鷹去：有一頭鷹便銜住了我所縛著一塊肉，帶著我飛到一座高巖頂上的巢中去。我所說的那些人果然把羣鳥都嚇走了，有一個人直到我所在的巢中來。</p>
<p>他瞧見了我先自一震：他以爲我要來偷他的寶石了，因爲這巢是他的。你們，要知道每人都有一個巢，往往當做是他自已的了。</p>
<p>我想他要虐待我了，因此便對他說不用如此：他儘可安心，因爲我不是來偷他的寶石的。</p>
<p>我說：「委實說我所有的寶石比你們一起所有的更多：不但如此，他們須仗著機會得來，而我卻在山谷中拾取的。」</p>
<p>我從袋中取出那寶石來，給此人瞧。不一會見，大羣的人都圍住了我，我就把那船撇我去後的一切經過情形告訴他們。又將一顆很值錢的大寶石給那最先發見我的人，我很快樂的和他們終夜同在一起。過後便同到他們的幕中去和他們同住了幾天。</p>

<h3 id="c194">獨身主義的看法 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 應申</p>
<p>原則上說來，獨身生活是一種病態生活，獨身主義底存在是不合理的。然而在現在情況之下，卻有許多人不得不過著身生活。我們光在理論上兜圈子而不深入於現實，所下的結論往往是不得不成問題的。因此，亦瓊先生雖然反覆發揮了『獨身主義的理想與現實』的議論（女聲三卷七期），然而畢竟把理想從現實游離出來了。</p>
<p>現在有許多人不得不過著獨身生活，這是塗改不了的事實。不過這一事實我們可以從兩方面來觀察。</p>
<p>有些人（這種人是獨身生活者中底絕對多數）根本不抱什麼獨身主義，也不是不需要結婚，（事實正相反）只是因爲環境不容許她結婚：理想伴侶的標準儘管低，結婚在她仍是不可能。</p>
<p>有些人，雖然不是『仙根仙骨』，雖然從未說過『不需要結婚不悄結婚』的話，然而爲了『努力於社會事業』，在許多不但不能獲得『美滿婚煙』，獲得『稱心意的伴侶』，並且連人的生活也是不到的時候，她們覺得應當把個人的利益和需要放在事業的利益和需要之後，『苦痛』的擔子放在她面前，她甘願地挑起了。因爲結婚『確可妨礙她們努力於社會事業。』</p>
<p>前一類人是被迫如此，完全是被決定的；但後一類人除掉客觀的原因外，還通過其理智，含有主觀的因素。前一類人是獨身者而不是獨身主義者，用不到和她們講什麼獨身主義的不合理，反生理等等道理，因爲她們同你一樣知道得夠清楚。後一類人不妨稱之爲獨身主義者（就是因爲她們意識底地這樣做的），問題的焦點也就在這裹，這兩種人，儘管你把獨身主義判了一個殺頭加上充軍的罪名，她們還是不得不獨身。</p>
<p>當然，世上也有不少怪物，把獨身主義當作一種最終想而篤信著；也有人『以退爲進』地抱著獨身主義，希望善價而沽。但這些人，當是少數，至少也只是一個部份。而這種人，唯有這種人，是值得對她們頭腦下總攻擊的。</p>
<p>然而亦瓊先生似乎把一根牛毛當作一條牛來開刀了。</p>
<p>不錯，對於那種努力於社會事業而意識地實行著獨身主義的人，亦瓊先生曾說過這不能作爲獨身主義之合理的根據，『是屬於另一性質的社會問題。』但這裹，亦瓊先生不免將『獨身主義』固定化了。好像獨身主義走遍天下總是要不得的。這種看法我覺得和把資本主義看做絕對不具革命性一樣，忘記了具體的，時空的條件。照我底未必成熟的意思，我們對於獨身主義一般地應採取否定的態度，但我們也必須要有一點保留，抹殺了這點保留，錯誤是並不小的。即對於那些爲了完成更重要的社會事業而抱獨身主義，卻不僅要加以原諒，並且值得欽偑。在那種人們中間。提倡獨身主義（這種主義已給以新的內容），義成獨身風氣，也斷乎不是錯誤。</p>
<p>總括一句話。把獨身主義當作一種目的是荒唐得可笑的舉動，但把它當作一種手段卻有時是必要的。同時，那種把獨身主義當作一種手段而奉行的人，反而是爲了根本埋葬這種『不合理』的現象。正如有些人的死是爲了別人的生一樣。</p>
<p>這種意義下的獨身主義，敢說絕對不是『不抵抗主義』，假使要在戰略上分找出一個適當的譬方的話，大概可以說是一種『堅壁清野』。</p>
<p>未必成熟的意見，謹請亦瓊先生指敎。</p>
<h3 id="c195">婦女問題講座 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>第一講　研究婦女問題的意義</p>
<p>第一節　婦女問題的概念</p>
<p>所謂婦女問題，簡單說來，就是怎樣把婦女從男子的隸屬關係底下解放出來的問題。換句話說，就是如何使婦女獲得在政治上，經濟上，社會上和男子完全平等的地位的問題，牠包含了婦女的參政問題，法律問題，敎育問題，職業問題，勞動問題及母性保護問題等等。</p>
<p>婦女問題之所以成爲問題，自然有其歷史的原因。</p>
<p>在歷史上看來，自從原始的氏族共有制崩壞和財產私有制發生的時候起，在人類社會固然發現了貧富貴賤，主人和奴隸等不平等的現象，但同時，佔人類半數之婦女也就失去「人」的地位，而成了給男子任意支配的一種奴隸。這種現象，特別在封建社會裹，表現得更爲顯著。在封建時代，婦女對男子的隸屬關係，正如農奴對領主的關係一探，已經不是人對人的關係而是人對一種物件找的關係。，就是說，男子對婦女，好像人對一頭牛或一張椅子一樣，可以隨意使用，隨意拋棄，更隨意毀壞！到了「文明」的資本主義社會，男女的隸　屬關係在所謂自由平等的幌子底下表面上似托緩相了些，但是，事實上婦女仍然成爲男子的抑魘，玩弄，侮蔑的對象。這樣看來，所謂婦女問題，早在氏族共有制崩潰以後便已存在，換言之，這個問題，是跟某種社會制度的存續而存續，而不是偶然發生的。不過，到了資本主義的勃興時期，才由近代的市民階級提倡出來罷了。</p>
<p>當平民階級在封建社會的廢圩上建築了近來的產業都市，而和封建勢力對峙鬬爭的時候，的確提出了許多值得注目的問題，例在政治上的民主問題，敎育權平等問題，職業自由問題，農奴解放問題乃至婦女解放問題等等。但是這些問題的提出，也就是爲了這應牠自身的生長與發展國。因爲資本主義的生產方法本身，正是需要這些問題的解決。</p>
<p>可是，資產階所要提出解決的婦女解放問題也和牠的政治的民主問題同樣是不能夠澈底的予以解決，例如婦女的參政問題，敎育問題，職業問題等等，在最進步的歐美諸資本主義國家還仍然沒有得著根本的解決，男女在社會的地位仍有天壤之別。這理由很簡單。就是因爲市民階級雖則打倒了不合理的封建社會，但牠自身卻也製造出不合理的社會制度來，這樣，在不合理的社會裹，公平，合理的事情是絕對不會存在的。</p>
<p>資本主義到了帝國主義的階段，關於婦女解放問題引起了本質的變化，尤其在歐戰後，各資本主義國家女工的數目一天天增大起來，她們在勞動運動上表現出偉大的力量，於是在從來的婦女運動裹面，發生了階級的分比，結果發生所謂勞動婦女的解放運動，而和中產層智識婦女的男女同權主義運動對立。他方面，在蘇聯建立了社會主義的國家，有的國家，建立了男女真正平等的新誴會，把資本主義國家所不能解決的婦女問題加以根本的解決，給全世界婦女們以極深刻的興奮與剌激，於是乎婦女問題的意義，上女性對男姓的解放問題擴大到婦女對社會制度的解放問題。</p>
<p>現在許多改良主義的婦女運動者，都以爲婦女在現存狀態下也可以獲得生男子完全平等的社會地位，但這是一種夢想而已。自然，在現社會裹，少數上層婦女是有受高等敎育，或就高級職業，或更參加到高級的政治機關之可能，但這和整個婦女的解放是沒有關係的。</p>
<p>我們以爲要解決婦女問題，第一要解除婦女對男子的社會的從屬關係，第二要解脫婦女對國子的經濟的隸屬關係，但這兩種關係的解脫，在男子中心的社會制度底下是絕對不能實現的。因此婦女解放運動，必然的滙合到要改變不合理的社會而建設平等合理的社會運動。因爲祇有這樣才能得到婦女的根本解放！</p>
<h3 id="c196">梳起 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 草明</p>
<p>「梳起」，在廣東順德縣底某一個時期，曾經是一種非常流行的行爲。蠶絲業興盛的時候，牠會經被業蠶桑的地方，過分神聖地尊崇看，而且被那兒的女孩子們，敵對地用來反抗不滿意的「婚姻」。</p>
<p>一九一六年秋天，敦睦鄉裹，自已有幾畝桑地的吳福如底最大的女兒阿秀，那性子強硬而爽快的女孩子不容人陰止地，借著她那能幹的姑母的幫助，舉行她底梳頭禮節了。福如，和氣慈祥的爸爸，除了不滿意他底妹妹阿蘭多買了一頭鵝之外，也非常活潑地招呼女兒底同伴們。</p>
<p>「怎樣？女人這樣的日子一輩子只有一次，就讓阿秀來得體面一點吧。」嘴巴，顴部的皮肉被左頰底刀痕牽抬著，做成一個醜陋的酒搖的阿蘭，答覆她底哥哥。這個除了用敎訓的口氣去解釋什麼之外，就不愛多講話的女人，像那什麼時候被人投在鹽缸底的茨菇，常常叫人忘卻了她底存在。即使那天晚飯後（因爲那些出嫁子的女客，吃過飯就走了，很少跟已經統起或未嫁的女孩子們一塊玩到天亮的。），剩下來的女孩子們好像圍城一樣圍住阿秀搶橄欖的時候，那歪嘴姑母聲著手督戰似地站在房的一個角落，沒有笑，也沒有說。總之，無論什麼塲合，很離得她表示一點什麼感情的。像給那些強烈的劫動情的舉動誘惑了，後將，她很矛順地答應了女孩子們底請求，講出一個跟她底身分非常適合的，有敎訓意味的故事。</p>
<p>像一羣頑皮的小麻雀的年青女人們，有意使自已沉醉在這一個夜裹，隨便口說得出，手做得出的事情，她們都做了，房裹面擺著的家具，床舖都改變了原來的位置，有幾個機跳皮的傢伙，熱心地扮著各種腳色，演著臨時編成的侮辱新郎的戲。剛剛請一個長壽的前輩梳上一個髻子的阿秀，帶了榮耀的險色被完全好意的下流話椰揄著，羞辱著，同伴們就非常過廳地更愉快了。</p>
<p>「歪嘴蘭姑，講一點吧，呵，你進過姊妹黨的是不是？」一個尖尖下巴的十八九歲的女孩子，突然向那向落叫起來。她曉得人家附和她底提議的時候，就更就興地繼續說，「就講講你底嘴巴怎樣會歪起來的吧，到底是你自已害的還是……」</p>
<p>「憑你們想，像我這付嘴吧能夠講些好聽的故事麼？」蘭姑微笑著，嘴更歪得像甜楊桃一樣了。「唱個歌給你們聽聽好不好？」</p>
<p>給女孩子們瘋狂地搖動著身子，她就閉上眼睛，仰起頭來，用很覺重的緩慢的調子，唱出憂鬰的字眼，像給大石塊壓住了的野獸底郵死的呼號。</p>
<p>「用的是，綫和針：</p>
<p>爲的是，自由身！</p>
<p>好姊妹，不要怨衣衫緊。你說呀，</p>
<p>寗讓花黃不願蝶來侵！」</p>
<p>她睜大了眼睛，望望大家，然後奇怪地笑了一聲。「你們吃米吃得太少，不知道的了，從前姊妹黨，像你們現在這個糊裹糊塗的樣子麼？唉，這是聖潔的事情！那個女人，不願意死了去見玉皇大帝的時候，乾爭得像觀音一樣呢？所以入了黨的人，要發過誓永遠不接近男人的。要是認被父母強逼出嫁，那末，臨上轎，姊妹就得把她底小衫小褲，巧妙地細心地密密縫住，大家便死了母親似地哭唱起來了。」她非常清楚地說著，像要人把每一個字都裝進耳朶去。「不過有一次石埔鄉曾經鬧過一個笑話呢，那個女孩子就是我母親的一個疏遠的表姊妹，依靠一對兇惡的兄嫂長大的。她出嫁了，而且回樣被姊妹們把她底內衣縫起來。事情很湊巧——她那個男人是個很聰明的傢伙哩；洞房那個晚上，他懷了一把剪刀在身上預備割開那些針綫；但可惜我母親底表妹不是一塊木頭。當手忙腳亂的時候，把她底肚皮戮破了——」</p>
<p>「啊，恐怕要死了的吧？」誰在呌著。</p>
<p>許多女孩子很擔心地編著臉孔，緊湊到那如來佛祖似地坐著的阿秀底後面，像在玩著疊羅漢。</p>
<p>「事情非常簡單：她跟婆家鬧翻了，並且跟哥哥嫂嫂翻了臉，但自已卻經鬆地過活著，一個英雄似地被人尊敬著。一直到二十四幾那年的初夏——一個非常沉悶的中午——她跟絲廠裹那個單身外鄉的火夫，兩條沒有吐絲的蠶蟲那樣在絲廠棧房背後，那個平時沒人到的草蓬底下，給人碰見了……」</p>
<p>「呵，那是爲了什麼呵？——」</p>
<p>「這個樣了，太可惜了！」一個女孩子機械地說。</p>
<p>「誰曉得這究竟爲了什麼！」歪嘴女人重新閉上眼睛。「她居然道樣做了。像這種不名譽的事情潰常有的！可是你們想想，我們底耳躱願意裝載這些有毒的漿汁麼？」</p>
<p>大家非常整齊地沉默了一個很短的時間，跟住就毫無系統地發揮著自已的意見。對於這種問題，她們感著絕大的興味，恰像她們在那陰森而單調的生活裹，需要一些鼓勵和剌激……</p>
<p>「懂了吧，孩子們？你們真的沒有聽過這個故事麼？」</p>
<p>「還有麼？再講一點呀！」一個年青而肥胖的姑娘說著，聲音有點不自然，像大雷過後，裝做鎮靜那個機子。</p>

<h3 id="c197">世界婦女大會 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 敏君</p>
<p>輓近以來世各國前進的婦女，鑒於各國內在的矛看以及種種問題無法解決，現已危機四伏，恐將因此釀成世界大戰；同時歐洲自法西方義得勢以後，對於婦女運動壓迫不遣餘力，例如今日德國婦女在社會上的地位幾被剝奪凈盡，「婦女回到庖廚去」的口號高唱入雲。所以特發起世界婦女大會，於去年八月四日起至七日止在巴黎第五區孟慈街（Ｒue　Monge）的互助會禮堂（Ｐalaio　de　la　Mntnahte）開會，該項消息，本刋曾有簡略的記載，茲將開會詳情，再列舉如左：</p>
<p>此交大會所討論的事項甚多，各國的婦女代表因所抱的理想和信仰不同，所以討論提案時每每爭論得異常激烈，然而她們對於重要點則完全一致。她們明瞭在今日在資本主義的社會裹面，所謂婦女解放，世界和平是辦不到的：她們均承認：（資本主義的惡劣環境是創造經濟恐慌的，經濟恐慌則促成向外侵略的帝國主義，帝國主義一到成熟時期則加緊戰爭，這是必然的結果。同時資本主義乃爲一般婦女以及勞動婦女解放的仇敵。）</p>
<p>她們認清了這睦阻礙誴會健全發展的根源之所在，於是各代表遂全塲一致表決各委員會所提出的決離案。根據那些決議案，可知此次是婦女大會意義之重大和婦女思想之深刻，眼光的遠大。決議案甚多，不能一一枚舉：全塲的代表均抱著堅毅的奮門精神。大會的意見歸納起來，可分爲兩派：</p>
<p>青年婦女派主張：「全世界婦女應當迅速謀婦女反戰反帝的宣言早日實現；</p>
<p>和平主義派主張：「凡一切從事侵略戰爭或延長敵對的工作，全世界的婦女應當拒絕參加」。</p>
<p>於是決議，婦女不從事帝國主義製造殺人工具的兵工廠中的工作；全世界婦女不參加侵略的軍事組織。法國婦女和平自由同盟會里昻支部（Ｌa　section　de　la　Ligne　des　femmes　pour　la　paix　et　Lyon　de　la　liberte）建議全世女女不參加一切侵略的軍士救護隊。後來鐵路女工和鐵路工人的婦女提出一個值得注止的建議案：帝國主義從事侵略戰爭時，即設法竭力以制止之。她們與鐵路工人，造盤工人，海員，冶金工人以及陸路運輸工人合作，其採取的手段如下：</p>
<p>Ａ反對軍需品的製造和運輸；</p>
<p>Ｂ停止鎮壓爲生存門爭的勞工的一切軍警的運輸。</p>
<p>女敎員敎議於授課時務必拒絕帝國主義的侵略宣傳。</p>
<p>除了決議案之外，該大會又發表一項宣言，茲特摘錄歲句於下：</p>
<p>「我們婦女看見人類受著空前未有的禍害所威脅。我們有抵抗並打倒這種禍害的權利，這是我們的義務和使命……」</p>
<p>大會又把決議案列成法典總括的說，她們要求婦女絕對解放，在社會上的地位一律平等，反對帝國主義和戰爭：此外從事被壓迫人類—沒有人種和國籍的區別—的解放運動。她們認爲婦女既是人類，應當讓她們自由去發展，她們的能力，讓她們去自由工作。</p>
<p>她們現已回去從事她們改造計會的工作，將來成効如何還不可知，但這次大會卻引起全世界與論的重大注意。</p>

<p>本危以不容於黎公之後人，不得已另行改嫁。此在我國舊倫理觀上，縱有未合，而根於今日之法令，及新道德律，實而無所妨。乃社會論調，及青市當局對本危均有不滿。本危不得已隻身南來，擬在西子湖上，覓一禪菴，青磬紅魚，了此殘身已耳。復何言哉？乃昨訊貴報能鳳凰續弦新聞一則，社會不獨無所指摘，且定情新詞，播爲佳語，竊以熊氏本危同一現世之人也，所異者男女之相耳，乃一娶一嫁之間，而是非之論，竟判若蝅淵。時賢方以提倡男女平等相號召，本危以一弱女子，乃不禁痛有感焉。爰依熊氏新詞略加改竄，另成一闋以寄意。雖知不倫，母乃在歌當哭耳。素仰。</p>
<p>貴報主張公論，乞將敝作登入婦女園地欄中，以求當世大雅之指正焉。</p>
<p>本危謹啓二月十日</p>
<p>答</p>
<p>本危女士：</p>
<p>這大約總是你的親筆吧，一字不改地替你發表在這裹。</p>
<p>你過去的舉動——再醮——我們認爲勇敢的，正當的。但今天訊了來信，知道你追於與論，礙於青市的逐客，已悄然南下。從此將青磬紅魚了此殘身了，這未免過於示弱。</p>
<p>王某，假使你認爲確可爲友爲夫，且任何一方，沒有半點欺騙的話，我認爲你仍得繼續前此的勇氣，實行同居生活。這社會上的封建茶毒，只有讓我們的「實踐」來踏平它的。退讓是弱者之行！不然，假使你真正不想結婚了的話，亦不必作那種消極的態度，你既意識到社會與論，有那樣的不平，對於老夫續弦少婦，頌揚有加，對一弱女的再醮，那樣貶迫備至。你也知道：這社會，只有每一個受痛苦受壓迫的人，連合起來改造，才能真正平等的。你該明的：消極的退讓，於已有損，與人無益，不如積極地進取，來做些有益於人，亦可以慰已的工作，不知尊意以爲如何？</p>
<p>編者</p>
<p>往事嗟回首，歡年來慘遭憂患病宕消瘦。砍樹女權新生命惟有精神奮門。黎云去淮憐蒲柳，天賦人權本自由，乞針神另把鴛鴦繡。青島上得相手琵琶更將新聲奏。雖不是齊眉舉案糟糠箕帚。相印兩心同契合恍似當年幼。箇中情況自濃厚。禮數吃人儀沸騰薄海濱笑端起頑漚，干卿事春水縐</p>

<h3 id="c199">職業婦女與讀書 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 梧</p>
<p>爲了生活，在職業的夾板裹壓了十年。十年來自已處擲光陰，毫無寸進；同時遇見之許多毫多寸進的同病的他人，偶一想著時心底便黯然。</p>
<p>在現代，中下等報酬的職業，每日大抵不只八小時的工作。工餘之後筋疲力倦地歸來，無論男女自然很少和書本相接，然而婦女似科更甚。所以婦女羣中，在家庭的已不待論，即在社會服務的，要求她有些常識，也是很難。這情形，大半是環境使然，小半乃是自已未能打破因襲的習慣。</p>
<p>因襲的習慣，女子早已和知識絕緣，和社會絕緣，於書本感不著甚麼興趣。現今雖時移勢異，女子也常入校讀書。然而讀書的最大目的，是爲得文憑；文馮的最大用處，第一是謀職業，其次是做裝飾。女子拿了文憑而謀到職業，算達到了讀書的最後階段，盡了讀書的最大作用；以後，便也和沒有訊書的女子一樣，戰只平淡地毫不追求地過活。</p>
<p>至於環境，在今日婦女總還是婦女的環境。已婚的職業婦女，工餘歸來有家務之煩。未婚的職業婦女，所交游的大抵是諸姑姊，所談的大抵是裝飾，娛樂，變愛，是非。因爲國勢日危，逼迫日緊，男子的頭都低下了三尺，女子的頭更不許她抬舉起來。有意義的，倔起高飛的壯圖，不但沒有機會給她啓發，而且只有機會給她塵抑，所以她便流於毫無意義而不自知。</p>
<p>然而光陰是人生的真珠寶，知識是人生的真米糧。職業婦女爲了生活的限制，不能不把一部分的珠寶當作薪炭，一部分的米糧換成糟糠，已是無可奈何之事：若竟輕輕地拋棄了二者的整部，使自已的生命衰竭枯萎，暗然無光，不但不能多所貢獻於社會，守會也將不需要於你；結果所倚羣的職業，也就成爲問題。所以爲充實生命計，爲保持職業計，職業婦女都不能不設法訊書，求些新的知識。這兒最要的約有數端：</p>
<p>一訊報紙雜誌　報紙和雜誌—尤其是報紙，滿載的社會的現象，世界的現象；在這上面，可以明瞭國際的情形，中國的狀況，和本人的地位。於是研究怎樣應付的方法，致力於有意義的工作。</p>
<p>二讀本行以內的書　職業有時與所學不能全然一致，則必易於不稱其職，故須多多研究才是。有時所學與職業或竟一致，亦須隨時研究新的學理，新的方法，俾學識技能日進，不爲後浪所推；</p>
<p>三讀社會科學的書　職業婦女民經踏入了社會，若還只重視家庭而不努力將社會認清，那是枉做了人。本身的職業何以如此動搖？社會的狀況何以如此不安？層層上溯，探尾尋源，社會科學書中，必能給你以解答。</p>
<p>總之，今日職業女女除看時裝的畫報，影戲或洋貨減價的廣告，消造的章回小說之外，眼睛裹很少再映些字跡。結果使她早年略灌入了的知識，經過多年的蒸發而乾涸無餘。一些久任職務的女性，常至冥頑淺薄，與稍有常識者不堪共語，這已成爲普遍的痛心的現象。職業解決了生活，解決了生活便滅卻了靈性；而有人反以此自滿自安，婦女又從那裹去長進呢</p>

<h3 id="c200">勞働托兒所參觀記 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>很久就有這樣的一個念頭，—參觀勞働托兒所：結果都是每次念頭動了一動，又被別的事情纏住了。</p>
<p>這天，特地下了個決心，—非去看一下不可；於是，下午四點鍾，我便在蓬萊路上找到了這想念已久的托兒所了。</p>
<p>托兒所是設立在勤泮坊弄堂房子裹面，一連五開問的樓房；進門便是一間兼充禮堂的客廳，正中交駐懸著黨國族及孫總理遺像，下面放了一張大餐枱和四張沙發椅，這都是有雪白的布套子套著的。我剛進門檻，兀自覺得有種嚴肅而又寂寞的空氣迎面撲來，我本能地楞住了一下；一會兒從裹面走出來一個茶役，我便交給他一張名片替我投了進去。茶役再出來時，後面便有一位女士跟著出來，一身藍布的旗袍，戴著托力克的眼鏡，含著滿臉笑意走向我這邊來，望我問著；「這位就是沈先生？」有什麼事吧？態度顯著非常的和譪。</p>
<p>我連忙站起來，笑著回答說；不敢！聽說貴所辦理的成績很好，所以我特地跑到這裹來參觀一下。是的，我還沒有請敎貴姓是？」</p>
<p>「姓朱；談不到什麼成績，還祇剛剛開辦。」她伸手招呼我後又重行坐下了。</p>
<p>「客氣，成績一定是很好的，我相信；不過不曉得這裹組織的情形怎樣，我想朱女士要是不忙，希望你能夠告訴我。」我開始向她提出了我的要求。</p>
<p>「可以，現在沒有什麼事；但是我們的組織很簡單，恐怕沒有什麼好的材料供給沈先生；」她淺淺地笑了一笑，接著說：「這裹的所長是李廷安先生，還有一位副所長，以下便是事務兼保姆主任，另外還有一位敎員和三位保姆練習生。」</p>
<p>「保姆主任就是朱女土吧？」我猜想地問著。</p>
<p>「……」她是微微地一笑。</p>
<p>「這裹每月的收支有好多？」</p>
<p>「經常費是四百五十塊錢，房子是敎育局義務供給的，所以有這麼多經費，開支是足夠了：不過托兒的收費，卻是少到可憐，總共還祇有十三個孩子，每月僅僅有二十元的收入，這點錢還不夠支配兩個孩子的生活費用嘿！」她說得忍不住笑了。</p>
<p>「在這裹寄托的孩子，大概是勞工階級的孩子佔多數吧？」</p>
<p>「唔！也並不像一般人所臆測的了麼多的：十三個孩當中，勞工界有五個，敎育界一個，商界三個，警國界三個，銀行界一個——」</p>
<p>「銀行界？」我連忙截斷了她的話問著。</p>
<p>「是的！」她很鎮靜的說：「這個孩子的父親是中滙銀行的行員，因爲他有五個孩子，這是最小的一個：做母親的實在不能把五個孩子都撫育得那麼周到，所以他才到這裏來</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>向我們要求，把這孩子寄托在這裹。當然囉！托兒所是該爲誴會一般人服務的，因此我們便答應了他的要求；不過將來這裹勞工兒童的人數超過定額時，我們還是要通知他把這孩子領回的。一她娓娓地解釋了一番。</p>
<p>我心上好像有一塊石頭掉了下來似的，輕快了一下，我接著又問：「兒童托的時間和對他們的敎養是怎樣？」</p>
<p>「李先生的意思以爲就孩子對於家庭的情感而言，是不能使他們和其家庭隔離的；日裹寄托是因家庭環境關係，那沒有什麼妨礙，晚上就非得回去不可，且寄宿在所裹，責任也比較太大了。所以這裹兒童寄托的時間是從上午七時至八時，由家屬送孩子到所：下午六時至七時，再由家屬領回。每個孩子的家屬，都有這樣發給的一張「寄托證」，領孩子時就得帶來：不然，就由這裹的人送孩子回去。對於寄宿的孩子，暫時是不收，孩子的吃飯是一天五頓；早晨七時半吃早餐，十時吃點心，十二時午飯。十二時半到下午二時半午睡，每天都是這樣。有些孩子在家庭裹沒有養成這種習慣。所以剛送到這裹來時總不能像別的孩子一樣的安靜睡覺，可是不到幾天工夫，漸漸地就習慣了。下午三時半還有一次點心，六時吃晚飯。吃飯時是一湯兩菜，每人一個小盆子和兩個小碗，像吃西餐般分開來吃。」</p>
<p>「孩子的衣服也是由這裹供給的麼？」</p>
<p>「是的，這裹並且特別做了一種制服由身是白的，褲子是藍的，式樣也還不壞；可是一班孩子們的家屬，都有這樣的一個觀念；以爲穿著所裹的衣服，似科不很雅觀。因些現在也就不給他們穿了。」她說著站起身來，招呼我說；「沈先生要參觀，現在就可以陪你到樓上去看一看。」</p>
<p>「好的，好的；請你打前面走罷！」我忙著答應了。</p>
<p>從這客廳裹走過去，便是辦公的地方；這裹有三張寫字枱和牆壁上掛著的一些字畫，陳設得有條不紊。在這房間後面，還有一間衣服間，裹面擺著十幾座比人還高的衣櫉，這裹放滿了孩子的衣服。早晨孩子到所裹來，須先到這裹換穿所裹的制服；晚上又在這裹換好衣服回去。從這裹再走進去，就是盥洗室；這裹有三隻沖水浴的「蓮蓬頭」，十二隻面盆，毛巾，牙刷和漱口杯。洗面的地方，是用土敏土砌好的一座土墩，小孩子靠在那裹洗面恰恰適合他們身體的高度；洗面時都是孩子們自已動手，保姆祇是站在傍邊負著監護的責任罷了。</p>
<p>「孩子們洗，浴是另外有保姆幫助的吧？」我望著她問。</p>
<p>「當然囉，就是洗面的時候，有的孩子還是洗不乾凈；不過我希望能養成他們一種獨立的精神。這裹洗浴本來規定一天一次，後來有些孩子的家屬要求在這冷天延長一點，改爲三天一次；你看，那邊不是還裝著一個大的火爐麼？」她指到那邊的一個火爐望著我說。</p>
<p>在浴室參觀了一會，才轉到樓上孩子們午睡的寢室；這間寢室是三個前樓面打通的，外面便是市立動物園。從這邊玻璃窗上可看到動物園裹許多稀奇的動物；房間裹的空氣簡直像公園裹那麼新鮮充足，在這裹齊齊整整的擺著三十張小鐵床，每張床上放著一條棉被和一隻枕頭，雪白的被單鋪著，佈置的清潔簡直和上等醫院的病房沒有兩樣。寢室的隔壁是遊戲室的所在，這是兩間樓面的地位；室裹有著兒童遊戲的鞦韆，蹺板，木馬，腳踏車，似乎玩具店般的陳列著，另外還有三籠黃鶯兒唧唧喳喳地呌著，引得每個孩子都望著笑了。遊戲室東端放著二十四張卓椅，整齊的分列兩排，小規模的會塲似的；孩子們玩得乏了，便坐在這裹休息，有幾們孩子還正在這裹談著。他們突然看到我這陌生的人走進來，都不約而同的停止了談話，露著一雙圓圓的小眼睛朝我看著。</p>
<p>「這些孩子最大是幾歲？」我回身望著她問。</p>
<p>「四歲！在這裹坐的，卻都祇有兩歲多點。」她指著那些孩子說。</p>
<p>孩子們的眼睛又一閃一閃地互相望了一下，似乎已經曉得我們是在說他們了。</p>
<p>打遊戲室走下去就是飯堂。這裹擺著和樓上一樣的二十歲張小桌椅；另外一面還擺了兩張大的桌子，飯碗和許多吃飯的器具，都整理得很潔凈的安放在兩架高到和樓板一樣的大櫉裹面。吃飯的時間，員和孩子是同時的；不過孩子早晚吃點心，職員卻是沒有的。靠近飯堂傍邊，還有一間診療室和隔離室，孩子們如有患普通小毛病的，便可到診療室診治；這裹有著和醫院裹那麼多的西藥，有施手術的病床，還有一架磅秤。孩子們的身體，每月檢騐兩次，每週磅騐體重一次；如果發現了有傳染病的孩子，便把他送到隔離室裹請醫生診治，一面通知家屬把孩子領回，所裹還可以代爲介紹可靠的醫生醫治他。</p>
<p>所裹僱用的醫生是德國人，每星期來所兩次，不過有的孩子突然的生了病，臨時還可以通知他來的。</p>
<p>所有的設備情形，我都看了；當時我祇有這樣的一種感想，同時也向這位熱誠招待我參觀的朱女士說了：</p>
<p>「中國像這樣的托兒所還不能普遍的設立，的確是件憾事！」</p>

<h3 id="c202">嫁人——一種女子職業 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 永年</p>
<p>在上海這個地方，無論你是租房子，或者是新接觸著一個陌生的朋友，大家不是問一句『你在那裹發財？』，就是問一句『你先生做甚麼生意？』，這都是問你作甚麼職業的意思。作職業的活動而云『發財』，云『做生意』，這倒是合乎在現社會中作職業活動的意義的。因爲在現社會中的職業活動者，不過僅僅是爲了個人的生活而活動罷了。所以那『做甚麼生意』的問語，固然本樸地表現了現社會的職業性質，就是那『在那裹發財』的一句問話，也是說你在那裹找錢維持生活，表明了現社會的職業之本徵。這樣，我們可概括地說：一般的所謂職業，就是指個人如何維持生活的手段和方法了。</p>
<p>在這樣一個職業的定義之下，那麼我們可以說社會上沒有無業的人了。因爲當官吏，軍人，商人，敎書，賣文章，在工廠裹做工，在鄉村務農，固然是職業者，就是在街頭賣草藥，玩把戲，說相書，乃至當娼妓，當乞丐，也是合於那以一種一定的手段和主法去維持其個人生活的職業定義的，這不是人人都是職業者，人人都有職業了嗎？</p>
<p>別的我們不談，現在根據這樣的職業定義，來說一說嫁人在現社會中也是婦女職業罷。</p>
<p>自從產業革命以來，把許多婦女從家庭中解放出來，允許她們在社會上找事做，這呌做婦女有了職業自由。的確，在過去的婦女是不能到產業機關，政府機關和一切公共的機關去作事的，而現在的婦女們呢？則既可以當女工，可以當店員，當敎員，當看護婦，當律師，又可以在公共的機關裹當辦事員，當委員，甚至當公使，領事，部長等等。如果我們跟著上面所說的職業定議而擴充其範圍，那麼，那些公開掛牌子且受法律保護的娼妓也一樣是一種職業者了。我們不要因爲她們卑賤，遂不把她們算在職業者之數，須知她們一樣是被逼得不得已，才採取那種『發財』『做生意』的辦法來維持生活的啊！</p>
<p>在中國，婦女現在雖已有相當機會參加社會的職業活動，然而大部分仍被禁錮在家中沒有找著出路，所以能由她們自由選擇職業的機會仍然很少。農村婦女，雖然能就近地參與農業生產的活動，但因爲一般的都沒有獨立的經濟地位，因此是以附屬於別人的地位而生活著的。特別是一切未婚的女子，簡直是寄養在父母兄弟的家庭中，連以任何手段和方法獨立地換取生活權利都說不上。因爲這個緣故，所以中國大部分的成年未婚女子，她們多半是以出嫁給男人當妻子作爲唯一的出路，以此爲維持生活的手段和方法。這樣，我們可以說嫁人是大部分婦女的職業。這絕不是一句苛刻語，實際上大多數婦女的心理是這樣，甚至社會心理也是這樣。在舊式的未婚女子，固然是把出嫁作爲解決終身的問題打算的，一經嫁給了丈夫，便終身依靠丈夫生活，來解決她的生活問題。就是現代的許多摩登青年女子，那怕她們還是智識份子，也是具有同樣的心理。她們在年齡達到一定時期，就專門注意到找愛人嫁人的問題。雖說婚姻問題的解決也包含在其中，但她們卻多半不再努力於自已學問才能的深造，總以爲結了婚一切都算得了一個歸宿了。所以在她們之間，或則選擇戀人專門注意他有無財產，有無能力和職業能夠維持她的生活，保障她的生活之永久的安全，或者直接希望著結了婚立刻可解決生活問題。這不是以嫁人爲職業的心理是甚麼？在社會心理上亦復如此，大家都認爲婦女嫁人就是解決她的問題的鎖鑰。在前幾天我看見一份婦女刋物，它就說婦女的經濟原是包括在男子的經濟中的，所以縱令婦女不能在誴會上找得職業，也不會發生生活問題乃至社會問題，這是因爲在她們身上沒有職業問題的緣故。這種論調它不明明是在說婦女嫁給人當老婆，就是她們的職業，主持生活的目的已達到了嗎？</p>
<p>我們並不是說婦女以應該以嫁人爲職業，並應該以此爲滿足，而蠊在現社會下婦女經濟不能獨立，和社會職業未完全給婦女們開放時，她們和社會都必然地要形成那以嫁人爲職業的心理，成爲她們不得已的苦衷的。</p>

<h3 id="c203">戀愛與年齡 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 少問</p>
<p>我不是戀愛至上主義者，我並不以爲戀愛是人生的第一意義，反之，她倒是隸屬於最高的人生意義之下的。不過，如果要談戀愛這回事情時，那我便以爲一定要在真摯地愛著之下，才會有偉大的戀愛。戀愛不應爲任何傳統觀念所拘束，男的和女的只要是真正地相互愛戀了，就可以結合起來，不必去要求上帝或不相干的人的承認。</p>
<p>可是，年齡與戀愛有什麼關係呢？我以爲愛的感情並不是無中生有的。而是在一些存在著的實際條件之下產生的。一對真正相愛著的男女，他們的坐活興趣。他們的思想必然是沒有大的矛看，他們的年齡也是大概相當的；否則，在他們中真摯的愛的感情便要無從產生。我敢說，一位相信無政府主義的女郎絕不會真正地愛一個縮頭縮腦的守財虜；一位不願意墮落，而決心在艱苦的生活中爲自已的前途奮門的青年，絕不會天天陪伴著一個充滿了勢利的虛榮心，抱著亨樂主義的摩登姑娘去浪漫；同樣，說是一個妙齡少女真的會熱愛一個白髪蒼蒼的老頭兒，那我也是很難相信的。我平生就不相信什麼「純潔的精神戀愛」的事情，那是禁慾主義者的偏見；我以爲戀愛必然是靈肉一致的。如果我沒有弄錯，那麼，就請諸位想想看，在一位青春年少的女郎與一位白髪蒼蒼的老頭兒之間，怎麼會發生靈肉一致的戀愛呢？倘若真的發生了，那的確是一件大的怪事！</p>
<p>當然，我並不是說一定要都是十九歲半的男女才會發生戀愛，不，我的意思是一定要年齡相當的男女才易發生真摯的愛情。所謂相當者乃是不要相信太遠了的意思，如果裹一青春年少的女郎去與一個種物的公裁，至一樣大的年齡的老頭兒結婚，那使是一件苦事，因爲年齡太不相當了。</p>
<p>於此，即使要我們退一步來說，承認青年女士可以和「老當益壯」的老摩登戀愛，那也必須要她真的愛他，愛他的學識才能，因而愛他的一切才是對的，否則，這戀愛便不能算是偉大的戀愛，而是在某種卑下的意識下產生的。更具體一點說，如果當著她被她的老情人抱在懷中的時候，真的是熱愛著他，那固然很好；反之，假如她那時是一面想著洋錢和什麼地位，一面又笑在心頭，疾想著年輕健壯的汽車夫或她那老情人的少君的時候，因而在這中間感到歡樂同時又感到痛苦的時候，那便不能令人贊成了！</p>
<p>然而，事實上，愛神維那絲據說早作了財神老爺趙公明元帥的婢妾，人間的戀愛已爲財神斧所支配，所管理了。因此，凡是年齡不相當的戀愛，大半都是在洋錢和鈔票的麼力下硬組成的。有父母家長的少女之與老頭兒結婚的，多半都是由父母家長貧戀別人的錢財所供處；無父母家長的「自由的」青年女士之與年老氣衰的人戀愛的，多半也是在金錢直接驅使當事人之下產生的。</p>

<h3 id="c204">碼頭車 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 漢英</p>
<p>所謂「碼頭車」是推著車子趕碼頭的意思。不用說，推這種車子的人是農民；但也有把這作爲職業的。</p>
<p>由於年來農村經濟的衰落，農民離村的現象是日益普遍化了。有的在嚴重的災荒中扮了災民四出去就食，有的則到都市去賤價出賣勞動力以糊口。此外，還有些保守性較重的農民，他們雖仍是留在農村裹工作因他們的收成時常不夠維持他們一家的溫飽，也是勢不得不在正業之外再找一點副業做做的了。</p>
<p>推「碼頭車」就是作爲一種副業而對於這種農民有必要的。這種工作大都是短期臨時性質，且大都是在農閒時期，所以也並不怎末妨礙農事。去的城鎮多亦不過兩百多里路，普通不過百餘里，所以距家總也不過一兩日的路程。由於這種便利，農民的趙赴這種工作，無怪其要惟恐或後的了。</p>
<p>可是推這種車子卻也不是一件憄樣容易的事。這種車子是一種我們常能見到的獨輪小車。推這種車子有一種用力的「訣竅」，要懂得這種「訣竅」方能愉快地省力地運行牠，光是用一般蠻力有時卻是奈何牠不得的。所以這種工作不是那「不在行」的農民所能勝任。一個普通的農村裹儘管有百把壯丁，但未必就有十個以上碼頭車的能手。有許多農民縱然心裹想藉碼頭車去博取一點生活之資，但他們的實力卻把他們限制住了。假使不是爲了這種關係，推碼頭車的人或許還要多些。</p>
<p>在安慶慶—上面所說大都係安慶及附近各地的情形，雖說這種情形在別處也不是沒有的—每年「下冬」要算是推。「碼頭車」的車夫最活躍的時候了。在舊歷的十一月裹，農事大致已經完畢，農民在這時候就可以拿剩餘的勞力到城鎮裹去換錢了。他們可以三五成羣的結伴投到安慶這城市的懷裹來。他們趕了自備的空車子，打算滿載而歸。到了安慶，安慶的車行就會接納他們。他們就可在這車行裹等待他們好運氣的到來。</p>
<p>在安慶，這種車行很多，光是在西門外的一條「和街」上就有十多家。從西部縣分來的農民大都是「下」在西門外的車行裹的，作的生意也是往西部縣分去的爲多。其餘北城東城的情形可以依此類推，這裹可不必去提及牠了。</p>
<p>車行對這班主顧的待遇大致是這樣的：每蝅只要他們出一升米，小菜和住宿，行裹是不要錢的。車行隨他們到的先後替他們「編號」，然後隨著每人的號頭的先後分派生意。米是由他們家裹帶來的多，所以即使一時找不到住意，他們也有消多所花費，而可安靜的等候著的。</p>
<p>車行給他們這種便利，到底有怎樣的好處呢？好處可說不小；農民大概是被規定要抽出自已收入的百分之二十給車行作傭金。農民做了兩塊錢的生意，有四角大洋是要從自已的腰包裹搯出來交給車行老板的。老板雖貼了點小菜錢，但這種不菜粗劣到只值得幾個銅板，就是不記在賬上也沒有什麼不可。總之，老板是得了一筆不小的好處了。</p>
<p>推「碼頭車」的工錢大致是由載重和路的這近來計算的。普通二百斤左右的重量載到一百里左右遠近的地方去，大致不能少過一塊五角到兩塊錢。假如是有錢的人們要坐車子回家地年的話，他們會同其多索塊把幾角車錢，或至少也要討幾角酒錢（這種車子可用棉被舖成坐位，可以靠的，在平地上走來也很舒服），至於沿路的茶錢，飯錢，宿店錢，雖也有講明「百包」一概不</p>

<p>推這種「碼頭車」大都是很辛苦的。雖然他們對於推車已是老手，懂得「訣竅」，但一天推好幾百斤重的東西走百多里的路，總不是一件憄末容易的事吧。這種善於推車子的農民，大都山居的多，平素在山上走慣了，又是從小時候就學推車子起，而且不論大事小事，幾乎是一律地非使用車子不可的，在他們，用「扁擔」挑，這不如用車子推的來得習慣些。除子割稻，「稻棵把子」非挑不可外，平常稻榖用車推，磗瓦用車推，棉花用車推……不用說外，就是糞也用車推的。在這種極熟練的情形下，他們推「碼頭車」的辛勞，應該是可以減去不少了，但我每一看到他們那種喘息不停的樣子和額上豆般大的汗珠，卻仍不免要油然的起了一種同情心。而且他們的收入也實在微薄得很。他們首先得貼掉許多米來等生意。好容易挨號數挨到了自已，去推推二百多里路，那也不過四塊錢左右，車行拿去八角，剩下給自已的也就無多了。還有，他們雖只推了二百多里路，實際他們已是走了四百多里路的，因爲這是雙程的一來一去而不是單程的呀！</p>
<p>不但如此，在安慶，要是人少，還有受游民們欺侮的危險。他們已屬十分貧苦，但還有要欺侮他們而向他們敲竹槓的。但事關上他們人總不會少，又都有一根「車棍」和幾股「蠻力」，所以倒也不致怎末失敗。過去雖曾有過游民們向他們挑釁的事，但後來他們到底打擊了那侵犯者而得到了平安。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>我認識周樂山先生是在老同學朱君的宴會上。</p>
<p>一個寒冬的晚上，同興樓的某號房間裹，人頭擠擠，大半是青年。那時候，有一位年紀比較大一點的某君，他的臉是長方，穿著皮袍子，看上去有點像敎授，在房間的一角大變青年的戀愛問題。好幾位聽者都在點頭微笑，似乎他的話句句打動著青年人的心。得朱君的介紹，知道這位就是著作家周樂山先生。當時我就記起他在「一個婦人的供狀」裹描寫在玩按摩院的一幕，不覺笑了起來。</p>
<p>初次認識後，他所給我的印象確是很深刻。我祇覺得他是一個合乎青年人理想的作家，他的口吃也是使我永遠忘不了的。</p>
<p>上星期，十路公共汽車把我帶到了膠州路，抱著一顆希望的心，走進了緣楊邨。</p>
<p>『答…答…』按了一下電鈴。</p>
<p>『啥人？』小孩子的聲音。</p>
<p>『是我。』</p>
<p>一張十一二歲的臉在鐵門隙處望出來。</p>
<p>『周先生在家嗎？』</p>
<p>『是。』</p>
<p>開了森嚴的鐵門，我走進小布爾喬亞式的客堂。</p>
<p>『爸爸，有人來看你。』那小弟弟在扶梯腳下喊。</p>
<p>兩個小布爾喬亞碰在一起。我倆道過安好之後，他敬煙，女傭倒茶來。</p>
<p>『先生是在寫作嗎？』我問。</p>
<p>『不，那裹來的這麼多材料，剛才在看一本「唯生論」。』</p>
<p>『呵，這部書的作者真是一位聰明的人物，去年他曾經到我們學校裹來演講過，記得講題是「禮義廉恥的科學分析」。那時候，全禮堂二千多同學沒有一個不是聽得津津有味的。』</p>
<p>『他確有學問，不過從他那本「唯生論」看來，似乎說話太複雜了一點。』</p>
<p>『周先生，聽說你要出洋留學，不知確否？』轉變談鋒。</p>
<p>『是，我預備到日本去。如果事實上許可的話，再要到南洋去走一趟。』</p>
<p>談到南洋，使我想起了最近的過去他在時事新報「青光」欄所發表的那篇「南國風光」。</p>
<p>『周先生，你寫那篇「南國風光」是什麼用意？』</p>
<p>『說起寫那篇拙作的用意，恐怕你也要好笑。原因是我對於神秘的南洋起了極大的興趣而時常幻想著，爲了預祝我到南洋去的成功，所以就大瞻的寫了這篇東西。』</p>
<p>『這並不是瞎說，當你那篇大作在「青光」裹發表的時候，無論怎樣忙，我每天都要讀，不然便覺得有一件事沒有完畢似的，原因是我也在作遊南洋之夢。』</p>
<p>『你這樣恭維得太過分了，使我感到慚愧。』</p>
<p>自鳴鐘的針跑了一圈。</p>
<p>『耗費了你很多光陰，抱歉萬分。』</p>
<p>『不必客氣。』</p>
<p>一團高興，我辭了出來，坐在車子上，還回味著他所給我的興奮。</p>

<p>名人傳記</p>
<h3 id="c207">愛因斯坦傳（四） <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 從木</p>
<p>在愛因斯坦的一九○五年的主要的三篇論文中，在關於光電效果等的量子論的，關於分子論的布拉文運動的，關於電氣力學的相對論的，這三篇論文中，關於量子論的，是超越一九○○年蒲蘭克在熱輻射論中引導出來的能力量子的概念，還只是當作熱輻射現象中的特殊的假說的那個界限，把一般所認識的在發光現象，光電氣現象上擴張了；在一九○七年更使之在比熱的理論上出於人們意料之外地發展了，說明了在低溫度中的固體的比熱並不遵從居倫，勃丁的法則。他的徹底的不連續說，在當時是給與了物理學的革新的豫感的。</p>
<p>關於布拉文運動的論文，在斯莫爾可夫斯期基的一九○六年的論文中，已經有了共鳴，這是無須在此評說的。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦在一九○五年的動體電氣力學的論文中的有名的時間空間變換式，羅倫茲早在一九○四年五月亞姆斯特當姆學士院的雜誌中，在與其同樣題目的論文中，發表了。原來愛氏住在偏僻地方，不曾見聞到羅倫茲的這篇論文，其發見當然也可說是獨立的發見；但這發見的優先權是在羅倫茲，所以，後來這變換式被稱爲羅倫茲變換式。但是羅倫茲是把這個變換式在動體的電氣力學上便宜地任意地導入的，愛氏則是從所謂「同時刻的相對性」的根本的考察中看出的，因而其論文中，於所謂變換式的結果之外，還包含了原理的地重要的意義。</p>
<p>如果要略術須這個愛氏的論文發表前後關於此問題的學界的情形，則此時便應呌做羅倫茲的電子論的「補強工作」的時代。羅倫茲的電子論，是在馬克斯威爾的電磁論之後出現的。關於電子似的，電氣的原子的性質的發見，在電氣分解和陰極綫，電氣傳導論，光分散論的基礎上，也有其前史；關於這個理論的羅倫茲的電子論是在一八九五年傳播出來的，而且即刻就在一八九七年由於扎曼現象的發見而得到了光輝的支持？其次，需的發見在顯示電子之實在上又給與了顯著的證據。於是，物質只是由陰陽電氣構成的這見解，便漸次地成爲有力的了。</p>
<p>羅倫茲的電子論，是以所謂絕對禁止的以太爲基礎，而解決了關於動體系的電氣力學的種種難題。但是，如果以太是絕對地靜止著，不隨物體之動而動，那麼，在物體與以太之間，作爲牛頓力學的根本原則之一的作用反作用的原則便不能成立了。又與梅格爾孫，莫里的寶騐（發見以太與地球之相對運動）相矛盾，不依從力學的相對原理。如果要稍爲詳細地說明這個問題，則在力學上的相對原則是在加里林，牛頓的力學上建立基礎，一物體系全體地進行運動，在內部的力學的實騐上是不能測知的。然而如果像羅倫茲那樣地假想所謂絕對禁止的以太，那在光學上是能測知那樣的進行運動，於此意義上梅格爾孫，莫里實行了他的實騐，但結果是否定的，即不得不承認力學同樣的相對原則在光學上也能成立。於是，在一八九五年的論文中，羅倫茲又說出了有名的羅倫茲收縮的假說，他說在空間中，即在以太中運動的物體，一切都要感愛這個收縮，所以無論在光學上也不能檢知其等速運動，這樣地迥避了與梅格爾孫，莫里的實騐的衢突。他以爲從電子之小到地球之大都是受著這個收縮的。</p>
<p>愛因斯坦的一九○五年的論文，是說相對原則在一電氣力學上也是成立，以在靜止體系與運動體系中的時間空閒之變換爲根底，爲公準，而把羅倫茲收縮說理論地演繹了。</p>
<p>羅倫茲並未像愛因斯坦那樣徹底地考究時間（同時刻）的相對性，但對於電子的質量與速度的關係，羅倫茲與愛氏則是給與了同一的結果的。</p>
<p>但在一九○二年及一九○三年，亞布拉哈姆在其論文「電子的力學」中，認爲電子是自然構成的單位，是不能收縮的剛體，而反對了羅倫茲收縮說。從而對於梅格樂孫，莫里的實騐之正確性也發生疑問，結局是不從力學的相對原則，而以當初的羅倫茲的絕對論爲甚礎，在物質的情性只是全然的電磁氣根源的考察下，計算的結果，看出了所謂電子之縱的質量與橫的質量的區別，算出了與這些速這度的關係。</p>
<p>柏林的勃蘭克敎授則認爲愛因斯坦的論文有重要的意義，特別寫信給他表示推崇之意；又，在一九○六年三月柏林的物理學會上，勃蘭克發表了基於愛氏的論文的，記載他的運動方程式的有名的論文。</p>
<p>在一九○六年九月於徐茲加爾特所開的理學者醫學者大會上，勃蘭克基於上述的運動方程式，發表了改變古夫曼的實騐結果的計算的論文。其改算的結果，仍然歸於亞布拉哈姆說的優勝；但勃蘭克不以此爲滿足，他想在羅論茲，愛因斯坦所說的方法上，獲得理論的優勝，而希望著再行實騐。</p>
<p>此後，在勃蘭克，古夫曼，亞布拉哈姆等之間便發生了辯論。古夫曼說，愛因斯坦的相對論，也只是等速進行運動的相對論，不是認識論的地徹底的相對論。準馬費爾德則打趣地說；四十歲以上的人維護力學的（機械的）相對論，四十歲以下的人贊成電氣學的絕對論，自已則是屬於後者。這樣，使得滿座皆笑。……</p>
<p>在一九○七年九月於德萊斯登的德意志理，醫學大會上，只有準馬費爾德一人在其一個小的報告中，對於愛因斯坦的論文這否定超光速度的信號一事發生疑問，此外便沒有關於相對論絕對論的什麼議論。然而，就在這年，愛氏在德國的「放射學及電子學年報」上發表了關於相對論的綜合報告，在其末章中，提出了在等加速度運動上擴張相對論的議論之一部。</p>
<p>及至一九○八年九月的德意志理，醫學者大會，其情形就與前二年的正相反了，相對論是得到了絕對的勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c208">𡝰娜爲什麼回來了？ <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 先</p>
<p>「𡝰娜到那裹去了？」——當二姊回來的時候，書桌上寫了這麼七個字，潦草地躺在半張縐揮了的紙上，顯得非常地頹喪，還帶著一個那麼樣子的疑問號：好像一隻圓睜著的眼請，眼睛裹剛剛尚下來一滴很大的涙。</p>
<p>二姊妹裝作沒有兒模樣，還頑皮地說笑著。但蘭卻忍不住罵起來了。二姊也沉下了面孔說：爲什麼憑空地責備她；她可不能忍受任何人加於她的侮辱。</p>
<p>其實，二姊當然在心裹原諒蘭。他當然也不錯的，她愛大姊妹。的確，大姊妹是多麼溫和可親呢！誰不希望可愛的人享受著人間的幸福呢？蘭就只知爲她憂慮著！立即會加於她身上的苦難。</p>
<p>二姊更是愛大姊姊的。大姊姊心的深處的痛苦，只有受盡人世間的折磨的二姊，才能夠司解，才能夠深切地同情。蘭以爲；大姊夫是愛大姊姊的，她該離開家——有兒子，女，愛的美滿的家。可是蘭不知道：大姊姊除了文夫的愛，家庭的愛她，不過因爲她是溫馴地服從。倘使她不溫馴地服從他，他也就不會愛。她想：一個女人的生存意義，就只爲了使丈夫愛嗎？甚至於敎養小孩子，處理家事，以及他愛情的不專一——同另外的女性發生頭係——都必得一一聽取，曲從丈夫的意旨；女人不就是一架機器嗎？她可不願意做一架機器。她對二姊說；她要好好地做一個「人」，過著「人的生活。」</p>
<p>可是蘭不會知道大姊姊有這麼些難訴的苦衷。他只想到；她離開家庭以後；她會爲了想念孩子而流涙；她會感覺孤單而悲傷；而且她將過著長久的風流生活，飄流的生活是多麼痛苦呵——像二姊，一個人多苦惱！多可憐！</p>
<p>其實，大姊姊未曾覺得三姊是孤單的，苦痛的。她反而非常羨慕二姊的自由咧！因此，時間終於給了她這一次的勇氣；她堅決地要逃出那牢獄式的家庭。</p>
<p>她決意要出走，這意思只告訴了二姊。當二姊提出許多反駁和利害的問題，同她商討之後，知道她這次的堅決，不是無因的衝動。她贊成她「好好地做個「人」過「人」的生活」的。於是她不再用消極的語言去勸阻她，喪失她的勇氣。</p>
<p>她們悄悄地預備好，沒有告訴蘭；下午四點一刻的特快車，她就把大姊姊送出了上海。</p>
<p>當她回來的時候，蘭就責罵她不該做出這樣冒失事。大姊夫卻更兇地恨她，問她要人呢。她只裝著不關她的事，她一點也不知道，找不上她。她心裹所打算的，只是怎樣替大姊姊找工作；怎樣寫信安慰她，鼓勵她。——有什麼辦法呢？女人要掙扎，要好好地做「人」，獨立生活，苦，必得忍愛的。無論精神，身體，那方面都得受不可揣度的痛苦的。但大姊姊和二姊說：這種苦，苦得自由，有意義，有價值。二姊也就只有拿這些空談去鼓勵她，安慰她</p>
<p>空談終於是空談，事實給二姊的敎訓，她難道會忘記嗎？但是，她不忍阻止一個地獄裹的人，熱烈地憧憬於理想的新生命的光；而她更找不出理由來動阻她回到大姊姊認爲是不可再忍了的使——不正當的愛，和不調和的生活。</p>
<p>「這是必然發生的事，讓牠隨著時間走去吧」——這是二姊所取的態度。但她也知道：同情大姊姊而援助她的，只有幾個少數人。社會，人羣，誰能關心她的苦痛？一切的苦難除非她自已去擔當，是沒有半點幫助的。那末，脆弱如大姊姊，是不能像二姊一樣地強頑，能夠和狂流暴風雨橫七竪八地亂撞一陣的！</p>
<p>因此，必然的，終於大姊姊回來了——被大姊夫接回來了。秘密的住址是二姊寫給人家的，也可以說是被大姊夫「騙」去的。但二姊早已明白；懷疑她，咀咒她，鄙薄她，她都不管。她的心平靜得和向來一樣。——她沒有喜悅的興奮，也沒苦悶的消沉。</p>
<p>只是，二姊從此不常到大姊姊的家裹去。她知道大姊姊的心是更加苦痛，她不忍去觸動一顆不願麻木而不能不麻木的婦人心！</p>
<p>「𡝰娜到到那裹去了！」但是𡝰娜又回來了！拉娜爲什麼要回來？狂風暴雨欺凌她；明槍暗箭中傷她；生活的絕處恐嚇她；禮敎的，宗去的環境壓迫她。受傷損了的脆弱的她，沒有具備一切抵抗強敵的武器，她必然地回來了！</p>

<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>梅羅勃蓀又說道：「我做優伶做了五十年，我現在覺得我還如五十年以前，在倫敦第一次登臺時那樣健壯。當然，我現在對於人生觀，已經不像從前那樣嚴重了。年齡的成熟，已指示一個樂天知命的途徑，並且養成了一個幽默的習性。一個人的腦筯，是不應該因年老而衰頹的。我一生已經看到多少滄海桑田的變遷。舞臺總是映照世界萬物的，而世界萬物是永遠旋轉的。而我徧徧能在舞臺上，看盡世界萬物的變遷，我覺得那是我的幸運。但是今日必後必定還有許多變遷要陸續在我們的眼前舒展出來，我亦一定願意活下去看著。在戰爭繼續進行的時候，一個人決不肯放下兵器逃走的，除非他是個懦夫。我決不做懦夫。我靜待著死神的宣召。」</p>
<p>五十年以前，曼麗羅別蓀（Mary　Robison）第一次在倫敦一家小戲院登臺。那時寫戲目的一時粗心，在她的姓名上，每字中遣忘了一個字母，將她的芳名寫成了（Ｍay　Robson）。梅羅勃蓀亦就將錯就錯，改用了那個名字，一直到現在。她的到好萊塢，是去年過世的老皇后曼麗特蘭漱引薦的。曼麗特蘭漱去世之後，梅羅勃蓀就成了好萊塢惟一的老旦角。她在「太夫人」（Ｌady　for　a　Day）中，已經獲得盛名。現在她的新片（Ｌay　by　Choice），也是一個不弱的作品。</p>
<p>有一位亨利姠妲克勞斯曼（Ｈenrieta　ro　man）。她第一次登臺的時候，還遠在一八八三年。她經過了千辛萬苦，漸漸成了一位名女伶。爬著榮名的梯子，是很慢而艱難的，但是她居然爬到了最高的一級。那個時候，她的頭髪，已經出金黃而灰白了，但是紐約的觀衆，卻看見她登臺而大家站立起來歡呼。她成名了。她當了。她告退的時候，已經在舞臺上足足站立了半個世紀。她於是購買了一所大房子，和她丈夫安居著。不想交易所的風潮起了，享利婀廻腳底下的土地完失剷去了。她雖然有大房子可住，卻沒有錢生活了。後來她爲飢寒所迫，不得不從新粉墨登塲，重作馮婦。福斯公司慕名，將她聘了去。她在（Ｍenacz）中，佔著很重要的地位，但是距墜她呱呱墜地之時。已經六十有五年了！</p>
<p>愛麗蓀史吉潑華斯（Ａ　son　skipworih），現在已經五十五歲了，但她亦是到了最近的幾年，才紅起來的。她在紐約百老滙，亨了二十五年的盛名。她有嘹亮的歌喉，亦嘗一登銀幕，但是在默片時代，她雖具有天賦的歌喉，卻是英雄無用武之地。等到聲片發明之後，她就一躍而爲能歌的老旦角。她在歌星平克勞斯貝的（Ｈere　is　my　hearl）中，佔著極重要的地位。以下就是愛麗蓀最近的一些談話。</p>
<p>「許多人問我，既已有了不少錢，可以愉快地過著日人，你爲什麼不退休呢？但是倘使我退休不作事，又叫我怎樣度日子呢？誰情願自已坐在家裹，儘著想牠是一個老太婆呢？許多人爲年齡而擔憂，以大年齡未老而人已老了。那就因爲牠們一天到晚，坐在搖椅裹想著，想著，想著的緣故。我記得有一位朋友，當紐約地下鐵道剛敷設的時候，就自言自語道：「他們想造地下鐵道了。不道我卻來不及看它造成了。」現在地下鐵道造乭後，又已經好幾十年了，而我那位朋友還活著沒有死。倘使牠不怕死，出來作些事，那末在這幾十年之中，已經作了不少事業了。</p>
<p>我喜歡工作。工作可以使一個人的身體健壯，亦可以使一個人的腦筯靈活。年齡並不是以時間計算的。年齡是與思想有關的。一個到了六十歲，也許年紀很輕同，但二十歲的人，也許已經老了。我對著那些一天到晚愁著老死的人而擔憂。以我個人而論，就是沒有工夫作空想的。我的工作，我的游戲，已使我夠忙的了。我亦不追念過去而悲悼。我但知爲前途而設想。我要站在這個地方，直到沒有人再要我的時候（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c215">評「再續情絲」 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ａ　Ｌost　Lady-國泰</p>
<p>差不多是用不著解說的，劇作者在戀愛與義務的釋義之下，那種戀愛觀的陳腐，以致於有利於現有社會制度，凡是看過這一影片的人們，都不會忽視這一點的。看罷，這裹的故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>瑪麗死了他的未婚夫，覺得萬念俱灰，誓不再言愛。不久，有一中年的名律師愛上了她，她雖然自信和他之間沒有愛情可言，可是爲了報恩到底和他結婚了。當然，最主要的是因爲律師有錢，婚後，她和丈夫盡情的享樂，丈夫給她做了新屋子，而且還有花園，這年齡相差甚遠的兩夫妻，似乎是過得很平安的。可是她又偶然的和一飛機師認識了，而且有了愛的糾紛，這使她的生活起了變化，有如平靜的水面給石塊擊破了一般。她一方面對於丈夫有著妻子的責任，而另一方面她又給愛情纏住。在這矛看的心情之下，她感學極大的苦痛，這使她瘋狂的喝酒，自戕身體，最後向丈夫提出了離婚的要求。自然，這使律師感愛著最大的難堪，他在十分苦痛的心情中，刺戟過甚的暈倒了。於是瑪麗自知責任更大，她不能不日夜奉侍丈夫，一直到夫病危急的時候，她才開始和丈夫真誠的相愛。（說明書上並不如此）</p>
<p>在這樣的故事之中，除了說明了劇作者觀念的陳舊之外，更主要的是使女子屈服於丈夫，犠牲自已的愛情，犠牲自已的幸福。在易卜生的娜拉出走了傀儡的家庭之後而且討論到娜拉走向何處的現在，不料我們還看到這勸女人們回到家庭去的影片！以前曾有人極力提倡戀愛至上主義，這在某一階段來說，未嘗不是進步的，而現在卻已受著時代的打擊，可是「再續情絲」卻是連戀愛至上主義都趕不上的。</p>
<p>但是這一影片，卻因著劇作知導演的技巧的優良，使影片的內在深深的印入了每一觀衆的心朡。很明白的，劇作者深刻的描寫了瑪琳的內心，使觀衆們給她深刻的感動了。更值得電的是導演亞爾伐格林（Ａlfred　E　Green）的手法，他不僅是依據劇本的緊湊而使故事的敘述十分簡單，而在對於戲的部份，他是非常勝任愉快的發揮了的。最精采的是瑪琳苦痛的喝酒，以及律師一夜不睡，清晨出走，一直到在法庭上不能支持以至於暈倒，這些地方都是非常成功的。同時我們也不會忽視白倍蘭斯坦匪（Ｂarbara　Stanwyok）和佛蘭克毛根（Ｆrank　Morgan）演技的優良，（但是李加圖卡脫卻因著不適合個性而沒有成功的，他根本不能扮裝風流青年，雖然他以前如都會交響曲等都很有成績。）這種成績，不是平庸的演員能夠做到的。不過我們認識，「成功」與「好」，似不相同，就是一影片本身來說，它的表現技術是成功了的，可是根據一定的觀點，及我們主觀的判斷，卻不能說這是一部怎樣「好」的影片。</p>
<h3 id="c216">評「春心映媚」 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Ｈere　is　My　Heart</p>
<p>大光明映</p>
<p>在「又驚又愛」之後，平克勞斯貝與凱蒂卡麗兒兩人又來了這「春心映媚」。也同樣是以歌曲的唱詠爲號召的。</p>
<p>這兒，自然地在他們這歌曲的階級性的決定下，爲適應他們的欣賞者的口胃，必然地虛搆了一個空虛的華貴的故事來包容牠。同時也實在覺到現實的華貴詠可者羣可詠歌的榮華已成了逝去的夢痕了於是這兒所虛搆的也不得不是困乏的公主與沒落王孫的窮貴族們，以調恊他們所發的熱烈又悽愴的歌調來求合拍與滿足當前峪㟱日暮中之華貴者羣的心情。更解嘲地以名歌家屈身侍役，居然取得貴爲公主的愛戀後，背棄他，終於又不得不投向他懷抱中的玩笑的演出</p>
<p>由於這一基占的出發，整個的演出就隨著處處在兒戲胡鬧的氛圍下支持著。從浩森的大西洋中的釣得一尾小魚，電梯跟前的色情追逐，真侍役的醉態，假待役的惡形，女婢的性愛變態，沒落貴族的狼狽，到貓，狗，小鳥的一切動靜，處處滑稽化了以所謂噱頭來行逗觀衆笑。於是製作者的目的在觀衆的笑聲中完成了。</p>
<p>自然，我們不該忘掉作爲這片子的主要部分之歌曲的。這兒有著“it's　June　in　January"　"With　Every　Breathl'　Take"與；Love　is　Just　Aroundthe　Corner"的三支歌。正如對話與動作的「噱頭」之成功一樣，歌曲也同樣成功地唱出的。至於所謂成功的意義，由於整個片子來瞭解時，我們是沒法給以更高的估價的。</p>
<p>導演Ｆrank　Tuttle把這空虛的故事總算用力地完成了該成的型物了。</p>
<p>兩位主角都還勝任愉快。以凱蒂卡利兒較有內心的表現。</p>

<p>在李萍倩導演的「人倫」中，龔稼農是一個喜歡喝酒賭博的小工，以致弄得妻離子散，身入牢獄，當他二十年出獄後，在他兒子所開的銀行裹，當一個僕人，可是他爲了環境的關係，他不能當著他的兒子的面前說，他就是他的父親。</p>
<p>有一天，他知道他的兒子要解一批欵子到外埠去，他又知道他的兒子在沒有動身以前，先要到一個旅館裹去，他更知道他到了旅館，一定逃不了惡人的暗算，他紙有趕這旅館裹來，果然他兒子的欵子被人搶了，於是，他不顧一切地將欵子奪了過來便逃，等他逃出了門口時，就便警察一槍擊斃了，可是別人那裹知他是爲了兒子犧牲，而不是做了張盜哩？（卻）</p>

<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>強尼拉米立斯對著審判官發言道：庭上，這件案子的簡明事實，已經陳明了，因此我覺得，我對於我的當事人，和對於庭上，都有重要的職務，必須再陳述一點；我已經發現了，被告的車子並沒有保險，但是她卻屢次闖禍，不一而足……被告的律師聽了，立即站起來發言道：「我反對這種說話。請庭上禁止。」那位審判官如同應聲蟲似的，立即宣告；「反對成立。」</p>
<p>強尼知道他沒有別法，祇有遵從法官的意思。他於是忍耐著繼續陳述道：「庭上，遵從庭上的意思。但是還有第二點。在這件意外發生的時候，十分之九被告是在灑後。換言之，被告實係飮酒過量，醉中所聞的禍……」被告律師聽見了，又站起來發言道：「我反對這話」。但是他卻帶著一些微笑。「對造律師這話，實係無的放矢，並且與本案毫無關係；再則，現在對於被告當時情形，並無人證可以對質。」審判官於是又宣告：「反對成立。」</p>
<p>強尼拉米立斯這下子，有些著急了。他說道：「但是，庭上，我不過要證明……」審判官不等他發言完畢，就攙言道：「本庭已明瞭貴律師的用意，但是貴律師應明白，本庭並不是什麼法律學校，在你沒有上庭之前，你對於案子，應早有相當的準備……」審判官是舒聞的，頭上一些汗都沒有；被告律師亦是如此。有相當的準備，頭鬆梳得光光的，鬍鬚剃得白白的。他們雖然不一定相視而笑，但卻是心心相印的，看不起這從桑諾拉城出來的，不修邊幅的窮律師，不讓他有說話的機會。</p>
<p>最後，強尼已是不能再忍耐了。他堅強的種族性，不覺勃發起來。他高聲道：「庭上不願意知道真情實況嗎？庭上不願意主持公道嗎？你不知道這可憐的老頭子，他的車子被一個酒醉的婦人撞毀了，以致他的生活之所恃，被一個驕恣成性的女子毀滅了嗎？她自已以爲有的是錢，殺了人都不在乎的。但是在這法庭之中，到底什麼更要緊？法律上的幾個專門名詞呢？還是真實的情形？」</p>
<p>強尼的話，使滿庭的人，都相顧失色了，但是倘使強尼以爲這個地方，他可以據理力爭的話，他是錯誤的。因爲審判官已經鄭重其事的發言了。他說道：「本庭對於真實情形，當然是很關心的但是從一個信口雌黃，言語粗俗，償形於色的…唔…律師的口中說出來的，本庭卻不能承認。因此，本庭不得不指明，貴律師事前既沒有相當的準備，你對於你的當事人，已經犯了失職之罪。本案因爲證據不足，即此撤銷！」</p>
<p>一切都完了。審判官已經退入休息室去了。那老農站在強尼的旁邊，情急地問道：「強尼，我的車弄好了嗎？你替我官司打贏了嗎？」這時那個黑髪女郎，悄悄地走到強尼的背後，用手觸著他的臂。強尼掉過頭來，縐著周看著她。她女郎，名字叫黛見埃惠兩爾，說道：「或者你不會相相的，但是我卻情願幫幫你的當事人的忙，將他的車子修好。我已經明白了，雖然審判官……你說好嗎？……」她說著，嫣然一笑，順手取出一大捲鈔票，伸手給強尼。她的笑，誰能抵抗得住呢？他開始笑了。他謝著她道：「你真好心……」他話還沒有說完，她的律師，勃魯克，已經走了上來禁止她道：「黛兒，你瘋了？你給他錢就等於承認你的責任。你不怕他在刑庭裹告你嗎？」（未完）</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Huang Musong spoke about his journey to Tibet, saying, "I departed last April and arrived in Chengdu, then proceeded west by land. I arrived in Lhasa in mid-August. I stayed in Tibet for three months and traveled to Nepal and India at the end of November. On January 3rd, I traveled by sea eastwards and also conveniently visited various islands in Southeast Asia. In total, the journey lasted ten months and covered 20,000 li. Although it was arduous, it is what one should do for the country. The general situation in Tibet is good, and there is a strong sense of orientation. There is also no problem with the Panchen Lama returning to Tibet. After completing the memorial service, I received a telegram from Prime Minister Yudha of Nepal, inviting me to visit. I stayed there for four or five days and was impressed by the country's good political construction and other conditions. On the way back east, I visited Penang Island and Batavia, where Chinese compatriots held meetings to welcome me and showed great concern for the motherland. In particular, the Dutch in the Dutch East Indies have greatly changed their attitude towards Chinese compatriots due to China's recent efforts to build a unified nation. My stay in the Philippines was relatively short. I passed through Hong Kong and Guangzhou and transferred to a ship northwards. I did not meet with President Wang in Shanghai. I will report to the central government and Wang in the next few days and then go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang in a few days, but the date of departure has not yet been determined."

<p>The Principle of Morality as the Fundamental Principle for Resolving Sino-Japanese Difficulties</p>
<p>The Northeast Problem as an Important Factor in National Antipathy</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation Should Be Based on Sincerity of Mutual Assistance and Mutual Benefit</p>
<p>Kuling: Chairman Chiang's interview with reporters from the Tokyo and Osaka Asahi Shimbun on the 14th included the following remarks:</p>
<p>Japanese Reporter: (1) In terms of the overall situation in East Asia, Sino-Japanese cooperation is necessary. What are the methods of cooperation? Chairman Chiang: (Answer) Sino-Japanese cooperation is not only necessary from the perspective of the overall situation in East Asia but also for the sake of the world's overall situation, because East Asia has only two countries, China and Japan, and these two countries are also important members of the world. As for Sino-Japanese cooperation, it should first start from the principle of morality, and then it will not be difficult to concretely realize cooperation.</p>
<p>(2) What are your opinions of Japan and the Japanese people? Please give us your frank advice. (Answer) Since the Meiji Restoration, I have admired your country's rapid progress and the general public's virtues of loyalty, filial piety, friendship, etiquette, diligence, and thrift. However, it would be regrettable if you abandon the inherent spirit of Eastern culture and are dominated by the ideology of valuing power and rejecting reason.</p>
<p>(3) Is there a fundamental solution to the current difficulties between China and Japan? (Answer) I have always believed that the principle of morality is the fundamental principle for resolving the current difficulties between China and Japan. Since you are a news reporter who hopes for Sino-Japanese cooperation, you should first thoroughly understand the true psychology of the Chinese people. Not only is there no anti-Japanese action or ideology in China, but there is also no reason to be anti-Japanese. However, the Chinese people generally have a deep-seated anti-Qing sentiment, that is, an ideology that rejects the rule of the Qing dynasty. After 300 years of continuous struggle, they were finally freed from the shackles of the Manchurian evil government. The entire Chinese people still have extremely painful memories. Since the Northeast Problem has evolved to the current stage, the trauma has deepened. This ideology can be said to be deeply rooted and extremely difficult to eliminate. If the Northeast Problem remains as it is today, this antipathy will deepen daily. The accumulation of historical facts cannot be eliminated by any force. Therefore, in studying whether Sino-Japanese cooperation can be realized, one must not ignore the important factor of this national psychology.</p>
<p>(4) What are the Chairman's views on changing anti-Japanese attitudes, improving relations between the two countries, especially in education? (Answer) China has always advocated good faith, peace, and hoped to enhance cooperation with friendly countries. Hostile concepts have never been adopted. The same is true in education, which always focuses on cultivating the virtues of benevolence, love, and mutual assistance. For the sake of healthy national thought, attention should be paid to correcting anything that violates this spirit and is sufficient to cause hostile feelings. However, regarding education and thought, both countries must pay the same attention and make the same efforts. The avoidance of aggression and humiliation against China will no longer cause any stimulation or resentment to our people, and it is possible to fundamentally improve our relations.</p>
<p>(5) What are your thoughts on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation? (Answer) There is a prerequisite for this matter. We should first improve the current situation between the two countries and restore normal relations. Then, rational and mutually beneficial pure economic cooperation will not only be possible but also necessary. However, there should be sincerity of mutual assistance and mutual benefit between each other and not contain other effects.</p>
<p>(6) What are the Chairman's thoughts on Foreign Minister Hirota's speech on China policy? (Answer) Although Foreign Minister Hirota's speech on China policy was very abstract, we have deep feelings about it. At least it can be said to be the starting point for the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations. I think Foreign Minister Hirota will be able to prove the content of his speech with future facts. At the same time, our people can also gain a new understanding of Japan as a result.</p>
<p>(7) It seems that the steps taken by the Kuomintang for national rejuvenation are somewhat too hasty, which naturally gives rise to a tendency to exclude foreigners, especially between China and Japan, which easily causes disputes. What is your opinion on this? (Answer) The purpose of the National Revolution led by Sun Yat-sen is only to seek freedom and equality for China. China has recently been striving to build a modern country in the spirit of independence and self-reliance, which should not cause foreign disputes.</p>
<p>(8) In the past, I believe that diplomatic methods are easier to solve problems between China and Japan. I think the most appropriate way to solve the issue in the future is with sincerity. What is your opinion on this? (Answer) I believe that Sino-Japanese problems can only be solved by relying on justice, and they can only be solved through diplomatic methods.</p>
<p>(9) Regarding the Pan-Asianism advocated by Japan, please criticize it frankly from China's position. (Answer) Regarding Pan-Asianism, please refer to Sun Yat-sen's writings, and you will understand my meaning.</p>
<p>(10) Personally, I believe that China needs a considerable degree of dictatorship. What does the Chairman think? (Answer) China's national conditions are different from those of Italy and Germany and are not suitable for dictatorship.</p>
<p>(11) May I ask who is the most admired figure in Chinese history by the Chairman? (Answer) There are many admirable sages and philosophers in Chinese history. The one I have personally followed and admired all my life is Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>(12) Does the Chairman respect any Japanese figures, ancient or modern? Who are they? (Answer) Rai Sanyo before the Meiji Restoration, and Katsu Kaishu and Yoshida Shoin among the Meiji luminaries are all figures I admire. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>[Tianjin] The fire in Wudao Street, Xingcheng County, on the 11th did not extinguish until the evening of the 12th. The entire street was burned to ashes. The Japanese army tightly closed the four gates and searched for resistance elements. Many innocent people were shot and killed. The cause of the fire was that the Japanese army forced residents to hand over their self-defense guns and promised to pay a price, but after they were handed over, they did not give a penny. The Japanese army searched the densely populated Wudao Street. In the house of Yu Zhizhong, they found one gun and ten bullets and said that Yu had violated the law by plotting rebellion and immediately shot him and his son. This sparked a civil uprising. More than a hundred strong men resisted with private guns and were surrounded and dispersed by a large Japanese army. More than half of them were killed. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>— Respectfully</p>
<p>When Japan declared the abolishment of the naval ratios stipulated in the Washington and London treaties at the end of last year, both Britain and the United States remained calm. Firstly, the treaties still had two years of effect. Secondly, Japan's financial resources were limited. Britain and the United States understood that Japan would not dare to rashly initiate a naval arms race. It has been more than a month since the beginning of this year. There has been no sign of any deterioration in the naval issue among the three countries. Even Japan, which first advocated the removal of naval ratios with the intention of dominating the Western Pacific, is promoting the return to normalcy in its diplomacy with Britain and the United States. For example, Japan's public opinion has remained calm regarding the recent exclusion of Japanese immigrant farmers in Arizona, USA, which shows its general attitude.</p>
<p>However, in terms of naval strength, it is expected that when the naval treaties expire next year, the Japanese navy will have 754,000 tons, with no obsolete ships. The United States claims to have 1.2 million tons, but many cruisers, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines have not yet been completed, and its actual strength is probably no more than 940,000 tons. Britain claims to have 1.22 million tons, but has 94,000 tons of unfinished ships and 60,000 tons of old ships, with an actual strength of only 1.066 million tons. Destroyers and submarines are useful tools for coastal warfare, and Japan has an absolute advantage in these two categories. Even the ratio of light and heavy cruisers, compared with Britain and the United States, exceeds 71 percent. In terms of attack, it may be insufficient, but in terms of self-defense, it is more than adequate.</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt, aware of the urgency of the international crisis, has expressed sympathy for the arguments of the military expansion faction and intends to actively implement a $2 billion national defense plan. If this plan can be implemented, the United States' territory along the Pacific Ocean can be as solid as a rock and will no longer be in danger of being invaded. In addition, former Air Force Commander Major General Mitchell has been advocating an airship policy, proposing to use 50 Zeppelin-style airships to reach any country in Asia when necessary and bomb it. Recently, the Army Committee also plans to invest 11 million gold dollars in building a large air force base in Hawaii, 2 million gold dollars in building fortresses along the Pacific coast for defense, 8 million gold dollars in strengthening the garrison troops in various fortresses, and 90 million gold dollars in increasing military armored aircraft by 800, bringing the number of modern new aircraft in its army to more than 2,300.</p>
<p>The reasons for the United States' military expansion plan are: First, it recognizes the Hawaiian Islands as part of its own territory, which is completely different from the Philippine Islands. Second, modern transportation is becoming increasingly developed. The flight distance between San Francisco and Honolulu is only 15 hours. Therefore, for the sake of self-defense, it is especially necessary to actively rectify the air force. Third, the Washington Treaty imposed restrictions on the defense projects of the Philippines, Guam, and the Aleutian Islands. Therefore, Hawaii must be its foremost line of defense.</p>
<p>Japan, which is implicitly in a hostile position with the United States, is probably particularly wary of the American expansion of its air force. Therefore, in addition to the so-called second air force supplementary plan, it is also preparing a third supplement to completely update the aircraft belonging to both the army and navy, replacing the old ones with new aircraft with long-distance endurance, striving to be able to stop the American aircraft's offensive. We all know that the Japanese are most concerned about the bombing of their country by enemy air forces. Its borders are surrounded by the sea, which is a natural barrier. Before the development of three-dimensional warfare, it could indeed boast of its safety. Who knew that with the development of the air force, which changes with each passing day, its geographical advantages have already lost their basis, and the wooden buildings in its major cities still account for more than 80 percent of the total. Once it is attacked by the air force, even if it puts all its efforts into defense, it will still be enough to affect the overall situation. Therefore, the United States' enthusiasm for the expansion of its air force is probably for this reason. In short, although there has been no special development in the naval issue recently, the confrontational situation between Britain, the United States, and Japan is still very tense.</p>

<p>Hiring a Lawyer to Draft a Document to Raise Funds for Appeal</p>
<p>Claims He Can Swear to God That He Cannot Plead Guilty</p>
<p>Flemington - Hauptmann, who was sentenced to death in the Lindbergh kidnapping and murder case, today asked his lawyer, Reilly, to issue a statement stating that the trial was improper. He said, "I swear to God that I was not involved in the kidnapping and murder case. Apart from what I have confessed to the court, I have absolutely no knowledge of this case or the ransom. What I am now asking for is justice and public assistance in order to obtain this justice. God is my judge. I cannot plead guilty because there is no guilt to plead. If someone comes to me and says, 'If you make a declaration, you can be released,' then I will answer, 'I have already confessed everything I know to the court.'" This document requests public donations for appeal expenses. A reporter visited Hauptmann, who said that the most absurd thing in the trial was the wood board in my attic. You must know that there is a lot of lumber in my garage. Why would I go to the attic to get a wood board? He also said that Lindbergh's presence in the courtroom during the trial certainly had an impact on the jurors. The New York police chief stated today that, as far as New York is concerned, the Lindbergh kidnapping case has not ended. This is a case in New Jersey, but if someone wants to arrest criminals in New York, it is certainly our business. At the same time, the New York Daily News stated that there are more than just three people involved in the ransom fraud case, but the New York police have already found the second person and are planning to arrest him. When Lindbergh was sitting in the car, waiting for Dr. Condon to return from the cemetery (the location where the ransom was paid), this person, with his head wrapped in a towel, peeked into Lindbergh's car. New Jersey did not mention this second person when trying this case because it wanted to end the case quickly and did not want to involve too many people. In fact, the police in the Department of Justice in New York and New Jersey have long known that Hauptmann had an accomplice. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Flemington - After Hauptmann was sentenced to death, his lawyer solicited donations from the public on his behalf in order to use the funds raised for appeal expenses. A total of 70 dollars were raised on the first day. Hauptmann recently received a telegram from his mother in Germany, saying, "I firmly believe that you are innocent and that the truth will eventually come to light." Hauptmann's mother also sent a telegram to New Jersey Governor Hoffman, saying, "During the European War, two sons and my husband all died on the battlefield. I am seventy years old this year, and I cannot bear another blow. Please, Governor, grant my son amnesty to avoid his death." The Governor recently said that Hauptmann's case should first be decided by the appellate court, and finally it can be reviewed by the "Court of Pardons." (Note: The Governor is one of the judges of the Court of Pardons.) (Havas, 15th)</p>

He was deeply saddened and is still living in Hebian Village to guard the tomb. I passed through Beiping this time, but the time was short and I did not meet with Chairman He. Shanxi is peaceful, but the social economy is shrouded in the national recession. The road to recovery is still far away, and it still depends on the government and the people working hard in the future. Shanxi's heavy industry has not yet been launched, and the government is vigorously promoting light industry, which is still developing. All daily necessities do not need to be supplied from outside. The turnover of banks and silver firms in the province is still smooth, but the money remitted back by Shanxi merchants living abroad is not as enthusiastic as before. I took leave to return to Shanxi for more than a month. I originally planned to return to Nanjing earlier, but I was unable to do so due to private matters. Now Chairman Shi is on sick leave, and the affairs of the commission urgently need to be dealt with. He sent a telegram urging me to go south to preside over everything on his behalf. I will visit the important figures in the central government in Nanjing within a few days to report on the recent situation in Shanxi.

<h3 id="e65">Public Release of Germany's Reply to the Anglo-French Declaration of London: Shared Desire for Peace, Willing to Negotiate Individually with All Nations <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Acceptance Expressed Only for the Conclusion of an Air Convention</p>
<p>No Mention of the League of Nations or Central and Eastern European Pacts</p>
<p>[Berlin] Germany's reply to the London Protocol has been simultaneously published in Berlin, London, and Paris. The document begins by stating that the German government shares the sincere desire of the British and French governments to promote peace, as the preservation of peace is not only beneficial to other countries but also to Germany. Therefore, Germany greatly welcomes the open discussion of the Anglo-French proposals. The German government is willing to submit the complex European issues raised in the first part of the Anglo-French proposal for detailed review, taking into consideration Germany's geographical environment to ensure its security. The German government is particularly willing to consider how to avoid the dangers of an arms race, as this problem is entirely the result of various countries failing to adhere to the disarmament clauses of various peace treaties. Germany firmly believes that only through free discussion can the issue of armaments be thoroughly resolved. The document also welcomes the conclusion of an anti-aircraft convention, and Germany is willing to use its air force as a sanction against those who disrupt peace. However, before formally participating in negotiations, it wishes to conduct preliminary consultations with various governments individually. Finally, the document states that Germany fully agrees with the British and French governments that the conclusion of an anti-aircraft convention is indeed a way to stabilize Europe. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>[London] Germany's reply to the suggestions proposed by England and France on February 3rd, as expected, has been published in Berlin tonight. It expresses welcome to the conclusion of a five-nation air convention by England, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. The reply states that the German government is prepared, in principle, to use its air force to suppress disturbances to peace; therefore, it sincerely hopes to promptly obtain the free consent of the governments concerned, seeking methods to ensure that this convention guarantees the maximum possible security for the signatory states. However, discussions on many aspects are not yet fully prepared, which can easily lead to conflicts. To conclude an air convention, such negotiations should be avoided. The German government believes that before participating in such negotiations, it should, through separate agreements with the governments concerned, clarify several fundamental issues of principle. Therefore, the German government sincerely hopes that the British government will first exchange views directly with the German government, as the British government is a party to the London talks and a guarantor of the Locarno Treaty. The British government believes that the conclusion of an air convention will be an important step towards the unity of European nations, leading to a satisfactory resolution of other European issues. The German government expresses great sympathy for this view. The German government, like the British and French governments, also holds the utmost sincerity in promoting and preserving peace; therefore, it sincerely welcomes the spirit of friendship and trust expressed by England and France in encouraging discussions among governments. The reply continues by stating that the German government is willing to thoroughly study the European issues raised in the first part of the London communiqué with the same spirit of attention to peace and German security. The German government is particularly attentive to studying the dangers of an arms race and how to avoid them in the future, as such dangers have already arisen since heavily armed nations failed to fulfill the disarmament provisions stipulated in treaties. Only the spirit of free compromise among sovereign states, as expressed in the London communiqué, can lead to a permanent international resolution of the scope of armaments. The reply makes no mention of the Anglo-French suggestion that Germany rejoin the League of Nations, nor does it mention the Central and Eastern European Pact, which is particularly noteworthy. The German government has separately sent this reply to the French and Italian governments. Because British cabinet members do not have time to discuss it, there has been no comment from official circles in London. According to opinions in diplomatic circles, the reply only expresses acceptance of the air convention. The British and French governments will naturally need a long period of consideration before they can decide whether the reply is satisfactory. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>[London] The matter of Britain sending a cabinet member to Berlin has not yet been considered. The Foreign Office is currently studying the content of Germany's reply in detail. The impression of disappointment here last night has been confirmed by diplomatic figures. Britain and France will soon exchange views in order to decide on procedures for conducting negotiations with Germany. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Opinion here is the same as in London, believing that after consulting with each other, France and England should send another official document to Berlin. This morning, British newspapers suggested that Britain could hold a separate conversation with Germany once. Even if the British government accepts this proposal, and Germany expresses agreement, France and England should still send a new official document to Berlin. Negotiations between the two countries regarding Germany's reply will probably proceed through diplomatic channels on Monday. The French government is scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, and the British cabinet meeting will also be held on Wednesday, in order to determine the position of the two governments. From then on, negotiations between the two countries will enter a phase of activity. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Situation Shows Some Improvement</p>
<p>[London] Today's newspapers offer many criticisms of Germany's reply to England and France, all stating that the reply is vague and lacks concrete proposals. What is welcome is Germany's declaration of support for peace and opposition to armaments. The Times states that the Anglo-French suggestions have been accepted by Germany, considering it the starting point of a new phase of diplomatic negotiations. Therefore, this reply, in its nature as a preliminary response, is an indication of preparation for negotiations. The Daily Telegraph reports that Germany has not catered to the will of England and France, but at least it is not resentful. The reply has brought some progress to the situation, but not as good as expected when the Anglo-French plan was first announced. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>[London] The impression caused by the German reply to the Anglo-French London Declaration is clearly unfavorable. It is generally believed that Britain and France need to hold consultations immediately, as the British cabinet believes that the consistency of opinion between Britain and France determined in the London Declaration of February 3 should be maintained. The subsequent reply to Germany should be decided only after Britain and France have consulted and agreed with each other, or whether this reply is indeed necessary, as the German reply does not indicate non-acceptance but is deliberately ambiguous. What intentions does Germany have regarding the Treaty guaranteeing the independence of Austria, the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, and the issue of Germany rejoining the League of Nations? The general public hopes for a clear understanding, and it is generally believed that the proposals put forward in the London Declaration of February 3 are interconnected and inseparable, including the air convention. If other parts of the London Declaration are not accepted, then the air convention cannot be concluded. However, British opinion is that although the various proposals are interconnected, it is still possible to exchange views separately on the air convention and other points. Regarding the Eastern European Pact, it is believed that if the signatory countries are substantially prepared to provide mutual assistance, then the drafting and implementation of the pact can be mutually discussed and slightly accommodated by the countries concerned, with the original purpose of the Eastern European Pact as a necessary condition. Furthermore, in the German reply, criticism is leveled at the victorious nations for not fulfilling the disarmament provisions stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. People here have severely criticized this, as the British and French declarations have repeatedly and cautiously avoided mentioning Germany's secret expansion of armaments in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Germany's retort can be described as extremely unwise. How to respond to the German reply will probably be negotiated immediately by Britain and France through diplomatic channels. If the outcome of the negotiations deems it beneficial for Britain to send a cabinet member to Germany, then the Lord Privy Seal, Eden, may be ordered to go to Berlin, but at present, everything cannot be speculated.

<h3 id="e68">Eden's Declaration <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>[London] The Lord Privy Seal, Eden, recently issued a declaration stating that the Anglo-French London talks have yielded results and will have infinite benefits. He also stated that the resolution of the Saar issue and the South Hungarian dispute by the League of Nations Council of Administration last December was of great importance, and that the establishment of the Rome Agreement by France and Italy afterwards has opened a new era for European reconstruction and the restoration of trust. The conclusion is that the League of Nations Council is now in a much stronger position than it was six months ago, and the collective peace system is consistently superior to the balance of power system, which has never been able to absolutely guarantee peace.

<p>[London] The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain, delivered a speech to voters, mentioning the issue of a Western European air convention. He stated that if Britain is to assume certain new obligations, it should have the ability to fulfill them. An air force alone is insufficient and must be supplemented by considerable naval and land forces for the air force to be effective. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Paris Maintains a Calm Attitude <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Recognizes that the Future of Negotiations is Difficult</p>
<p>But the Door to Understanding Remains Open</p>
<p>[Paris] It is expected here that the British and French governments, after consultation, will soon jointly reply to the German telegram. A certain important French figure told a Reuters interviewer here today, "Our attitude is extremely calm. It would be especially welcome if the German dispatch referred to the Eastern European or Central European pacts, and not just the air convention. But Germany may believe that the Eastern European Pact and the Rome Agreement are currently in progress, so there is no need for the dispatch to involve them." (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Responsible figures here are not very surprised by the German memorandum answering the Anglo-French London suggestions. They believe that although the German reply cannot be said to have expressed agreement, it has at least not closed the door to future understanding. To seek future understanding, it is necessary to go through lengthy negotiations, and these negotiations will be extremely difficult. Now it is just the beginning. Germany has not paid attention to the various issues raised in the London Declaration, but has uniquely emphasized the conclusion of an air convention, believing that the air convention means allowing Germany to establish an air force, which is quite noteworthy. In the German reply, no mention is made of the Kinau River Convention (i.e., the Central European Pact guaranteeing Austria's independence) and the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact, probably because Germany requested France and Italy in early February to provide a detailed explanation of the Danube River Convention, and France also sent a note to the German government in January of this year, replying to the German memorandum of September 10 last year regarding the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact. Germany needs to reply to this French note separately, so neither matter was mentioned in this reply to England and France. In addition, the fact that the German reply did not mention the League of Nations is also noteworthy to responsible figures here. It is probably that the German government believes that Germany's position on the League of Nations over the past two years has been very clear and does not need to be explained further. If so, whether the issue of Germany rejoining the League of Nations can be finally decided only after other issues have been resolved is a question. In short, all issues should be negotiated simultaneously and cannot be separated. This is the basic principle of the London Declaration. It is incomprehensible why the German reply does not express an opinion on this basic principle. However, the British and French governments should firmly maintain the principles and text of the London Declaration from beginning to end. Also, according to the London Declaration, a general arms limitation convention must be signed first, and the Eastern European and Danube River conventions should be signed at the same time to replace the arms clauses in Part V of the Treaty of Versailles. The German reply avoids expressing an opinion on the possibility of concluding this general arms limitation convention. Even more noteworthy is that the German reply implicitly indicates the reasons on which Germany's policy of rearming is based: due to the fact that heavily armed countries have not complied with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles to implement arms reduction, it should be known that the governments of England, France, the United States, Italy, and Germany clearly stipulated in the declaration made on December 11, 1932, the method of gradually reducing armaments, which has been recognized by important German government officials, and in October 1933, when Germany announced its withdrawal from the League of Nations, the three countries of England, France, and the United States also proposed a plan for gradually reducing armaments, which shows that Germany's accusations do not conform to the facts. In addition, the German note suggests that the leaders of the British and German governments hold informal talks. If this procedure can facilitate the resolution of various outstanding issues, then the French government should naturally be pleased. In short, the note submitted by the German government to the British and French ambassadors in Germany yesterday must be carefully studied in Paris and London together before negotiations can continue. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The memorandum from Germany regarding the Anglo-French declaration has been published in all morning newspapers today, becoming the material for discussions in political circles. The parliamentary discussion of this case last night was very heated. According to external speculation, the content of the reply will be nothing more than two points: (1) the wording will be very gentle, and (2) the door to all developments will be fully open. People here are very uneasy about Germany's intention to negotiate with Britain first, because this action is tantamount to demolishing the cooperation between Britain and France. The French embassy in Britain issued a message last night, stating that the British and French governments, in view of Germany's attitude, are willing to reconsider the London Declaration. This decision is supported by all newspapers that are concerned about world peace. A small magazine stated that Germany's reply has nothing other than the inherent color of German diplomacy in recent years. However, since the path is not blocked, we must maintain a patient attitude. If the Germans can recognize the indivisibility of the London Declaration, then the result will be satisfactory. The Petit Parisien believes that Germany's reply must be very cold. On the surface, Germany does not oppose the Anglo-French suggestions, but it has implicitly shelved these suggestions. Another newspaper finds it strange that the German reply does not mention the most important parts of the London suggestions. L'Industrie believes that the German reply is very cunning. Le Matin advocates against being dogmatic and opposes immediately accusing Germany of demanding equality but not being willing to pay the price, because it is now in the initial stage of talks. Although the situation may be smooth or rough in the future, as long as there is sincerity, the door to negotiations will never be closed. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>[Rome] The German government's reply to the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3 has been reprinted in important positions in the newspapers here, but without any criticism, so as not to hinder the negotiations of the countries concerned. This is in line with the attitude that the government should take during the initial negotiations. Political figures suspected that Germany might be delaying things even before the German reply was published, and they are even more worried at this moment. However, it is generally believed that the friendship between Italy, France, and England has become a major fact and should be maintained. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>U.S. House Committee Submits Report</p>
<p>Accuses Soviet Russia of Violating Promised Guarantees</p>
<p>National Socialist Party's Expanded Propaganda is Cause for Concern</p>
<p>[Washington] The House Committee investigating the National Socialist movement in the United States today confirmed General Poutland's claim that someone offered him the position of commander, enabling him to lead a fascist army to march on Washington. The committee's report also attacked Soviet Russia, accusing it of not keeping its promise to stop communist propaganda in the United States in exchange for U.S. recognition of Soviet Russia. General Poutland's report claimed that the fascist leader in the United States used huge sums of money as bait to induce him to lead party members to march on Washington. Senior government officials unanimously laughed at this, but the committee's investigation has vindicated Poutland. The committee stated that it has not yet obtained evidence proving that foreign governments should be held responsible for this matter. The governments of Germany, Italy, Soviet Russia, and Mexico have been criticized for this matter. It is said that the representatives of the Jost government are obviously engaged in expanded propaganda. Congress has already suggested curbing foreign ideologies that harm the democratic system of the United States. The committee's report stated that evidence has been collected proving that some people are plotting to organize fascist groups in the United States. There is no doubt that this conspiracy is being considered, and if the party's financiers believe that the time is ripe, this plan may have already been implemented. The committee strongly criticized the National Socialist Party's propaganda, stating that the National Socialist Party's propaganda includes large-scale gatherings, literary propaganda, and short-wave radio.

<p>[Tokyo] Britain's aviation network construction plan in the Far East has attracted worldwide attention.

Their purpose is definitely to construct the aviation route between Hong Kong and Singapore. According to other information, the British Air Force is currently investigating aviation routes in the South Pacific. It is said that its purpose is to construct aviation routes between the South Pacific and China. Thus, the British aviation network, with Singapore as the center, extends to the South Pacific and China. Its completion is only a matter of time. When the Singapore naval port is completed, the power of the British Air Force can also dominate the skies of the Far East. The future is quite noteworthy. (Japan United News, 16th)</p>

Tokyo has decided to use 30 million yen to organize a trans-Pacific airline, and a committee has been formed to order a flying ship from the Zeppelin company in Friedrichshafen in a short period of time. It is about twice the size of those built in the past, costing more than 10 million yen, and is scheduled to be delivered in early 1936. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Dalian The Pacific Airline in Tokyo, with capital of ¥33,000,000, is proceeding with the opening of an air route between San Francisco and the Dutch East Indies, with a stopover in Dalian. Since the company recently applied to the Kwantung Leased Territory authorities for a license to stop over in Dalian, this matter has been officially announced. According to its plan, it hopes to open two air routes, one between San Francisco and Dalian, and the other between Dalian and the Dutch East Indies. The two routes are connected to each other, and it plans to use three Zeppelin-type flying ships to travel between them, costing about ¥15,000,000. One of them may be exchanged for Manchurian soybeans with Germany. These negotiations are currently underway. The Kwantung Government has transferred the company's application to the Tokyo Ministry of Communications for consideration.</p>
<p>Also, Tokyo The Japanese Pacific Airline is currently building flying ships for its plan to fly between Japan and Manchuria, and plans to expand the route and cross the Pacific Ocean within a few years. According to the company's announcement, the accident of the American flying ship is not enough to affect its original plan. German technicians can avoid the shortcomings that occurred in American manufacturing. The past achievements of Zeppelin flying ships are safe proof. (External Opinion Society)</p>

<p>Thick Fog Causes Impact with Mountain Peak, Resulting in Instant Fire</p>
<p>Four Military Officers and Experts Killed</p>
<p>Messina – A British Royal Air Force airship, en route from Naples to the Kalafrana seaplane base in Malta this morning, crashed on a mountainside near Messina in Sicily. Three aviation officers and one aviation technical expert were killed. The airship, equipped with four engines, was one of four en route from Britain to Singapore. The only eyewitness to the crash was a farmer digging on the hillside. He stated that the entire mountain was shrouded in fog and the sky was filled with clouds. At approximately 9:30 AM, as he looked up at the sky, he suddenly saw an aircraft descending from the clouds, one wing up and one wing down. The lower wing of the aircraft appeared to have struck the mountainside, and a dense cloud of smoke immediately erupted, followed by a loud explosion. According to his account, the aircraft was already on fire before it hit the mountain. After impact, it shattered into pieces and fell onto the hillside. He immediately rushed to the scene and saw two people in front of the aircraft, their bodies half-burned. However, due to the intense flames, he could not approach. He then found a section of the aircraft body some distance away and rushed to San Filippo to report to the local authorities. The official immediately led Red Cross workers to the crash site to collect the charred remains. Shortly thereafter, heavy rain began to fall, and the work was suspended. Due to nightfall, it had to be postponed until the next morning. At that time, only three bodies had been recovered. The Royal Air Force has begun a thorough investigation into the cause of the crash. The Admiralty has dispatched a warship to transport the remains of the four victims back to England.

Outwardly, we must seek peace; inwardly, we must have the will to reform. The government's current plans have a firm will to reform the administration. The government has already taken steps to reduce interest rates and circulate finance. This is an important measure to restore the normal state of exchange rates. Now, it is advocating measures to prevent unemployment. The reason why I have this appeal is that I have always believed in the Republic.

<h3 id="e95">Discussions in Tianjin Regarding Issues in the War Zone <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Doihara's Instructions</p>
<p>Yin Tao Expresses Extreme Optimism</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Yin Tong, Yin Rugeng, and Tao Shangming arrived in Tianjin on the evening of the 10th with Takahashi, a military attache from the Japanese Embassy, to discuss various unresolved issues in the war zone. Knowing that Iwaga would arrive in Tianjin from Yu on the 11th to meet Doihara, they arranged to come to Tianjin to discuss the matter together. At 2:00 PM on the 11th, the two Yins and Tao Shangming went to the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese Concession to visit Doihara and meet Takahashi. Under Doihara's instructions, they briefly exchanged views on matters in the war zone. At 2:00 PM, Takahashi accompanied Yin Rugeng to visit Meijin, the commander of the Japanese garrison, at the Japanese military camp in Haiguang Temple. At 3:00 PM, Yin Rugeng left and went to the Provincial Government to visit Yu Xuezhong to discuss the principles of the negotiations on the eastward deployment of the newly formed special task force in the Gaoyi war zone. At 2:30 PM, Iwaga arrived in Tianjin from Yu via the Pingyu train and waited at the Tokiwa Inn. The two Yins and Tao Shangming visited again and had a long talk in Room 10 of the inn. The matters discussed at the time were: (1) the issue of the exchange of garrisons for the newly formed Hebei War Zone Special Police Force; (2) the issue of cracking down on Japanese and Korean thugs in Luanle and restricting the forcible opening of drug dens; (3) the issue of reorganizing the Yutian Security Supplementary Team and Wang Bingxiao's local militia; (4) the issue of taking over the Eastern Mausoleum of Malanyu. The discussion lasted for three hours and ended at 6:30 PM. After the meeting, Yin Tong hosted a banquet at the Beining official residence on Haihe Road to entertain the guests. Iwaga and Takahashi sent Doihara off on the train south on the 12th and then went to Ping. Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming returned to Ping and Tang on the 12th and 13th to begin discussing the contents of the bilateral talks. According to Yin Rugeng after the meeting, the important matter discussed between the two parties this month was the issue of exchanging garrisons for the newly formed Special Police Force in the war zone, which has generally made progress. It is believed that it will be possible to enter the area within a short period of time. The principle of taking over the Eastern Mausoleum of Malanyu had already been agreed upon, but there were some difficulties in implementation. The discussion today focused on this point. However, the date of the takeover has not yet been determined. I will leave Tianjin and return within a day or two. According to Tao Shangming, the number of guns and personnel that the Special Police Force in the war zone should carry when entering Luandong to exchange garrisons had already been discussed and there were no problems. It will be implemented soon. The atmosphere of drugs in Tangdong and other places has been cracked down by 60% to 70% through successive negotiations. It is expected to be completely eliminated soon. This matter was also studied today to find a way to facilitate its implementation. The political situation in Luandong is still stable. I will return to Tangshan in a day or two.</p>
<p>Doihara arrived in Tianjin from Ping at 7:00 PM on the 9th. Sakai, the chief of staff of the Japanese army in Tianjin, and senior staff officers Oki and Kawaguchi all went to the station to welcome him. After Doihara got off the train, he went to the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese Concession. That evening, Meijin, the commander of the Japanese garrison, hosted him at the Haiguang Temple barracks, accompanied by Sakai and Japanese Consul-General Kawagoe. At around 10:00 AM on the 10th, Doihara and Oki visited Yu Xuezhong at the Zhili Provincial Government and left after talking for about an hour. At 11:00 AM on the 11th, he visited Mayor Zhang Tingao at the Municipal Government and talked for about half an hour. He described his feelings about coming to China and stated that he had no mission, saying that the relations between China and Japan had deteriorated due to the deadlock in the China-Japan issue. This time, he plans to visit various places and meet with various authorities to show contact and to hear the opinions of the Chinese authorities on how to restore Sino-Japanese friendship and maintain East Asian peace. He recently heard that the Chinese government has banned the transportation of salt to Japan. He did not know the truth of the matter. Zhang told him that the reason why salt was not transported to Japan was because the transportation cost was too high. After arriving in Japan, the price was very low. All the salt merchants automatically did not transport it, and the government did not issue any orders to prohibit it. That evening at 7:00 PM, Zhang hosted a banquet at the Municipal Government. Doihara is scheduled to go to Qingdao on the 12th and then go south to Shanghai. (11th)</p>

<h3 id="e96">Decline of the Guangdong Match Industry <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Five Large Factories Closed Down Last Year</p>
<p>Remaining Factories Have Not Resumed Work This Spring</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong match industry, at its peak, had more than a hundred match factories in various places. After 1924, the workers demanded a wage increase and won. The wage increase dealt a blow to the business. In addition, the commercial recession in the Nanyang region in recent years has greatly reduced the sales of Guangdong matches to the Nanyang market. By 1932, only about 30 factories remained. The industry was barely surviving. The reason why it could not compete with foreign goods in the Nanyang market was that the cost of Guangdong-made matches was too high. It was found that the wages for Guangdong-made matches were high, and after leaving the factory, they had to pay two taxes. That is, each gross (1,200 boxes) of matches had to pay a unified tax of 3.8 yuan and a raw material tax of 1 yuan. Including the cost, the selling price of each gross was about 8 yuan. On the other hand, foreign matches were almost one-third cheaper per gross. Therefore, foreign matches not only occupied the entire Nanyang market, but even in the inland areas, imported matches were transported and sold. As a result, the Guangdong match industry was on the verge of collapse. Last year, due to the lack of sales of goods, the factories had an inventory of matches worth about 2 million yuan. Moreover, during the year-end period, there was no cash turnover, so the factories stopped production at the end of the year. Those who were unable to support and declared bankruptcy included Guangzhou Gongyi Factory, Jiangmen Wenming Factory, Huadi Dayi Factory, Shiqiao Guangzhongxing Factory, and Taishan Zhujiang Factory, totaling five factories. The loss of capital reached more than 1 million yuan, which caused a great impact. As for those who stopped production but did not go bankrupt, there is still no hope of resuming production since the spring. It is heard that the goods accumulated last year have not been sold off yet. If the sales gradually increase in the spring and the inventory is gradually sold off, the factories will be able to resume production three months later. Otherwise, the future is unimaginable. According to investigations, there are currently only eleven match factories remaining in the province, including China, Guangda, Dongshan, Guangdong, and Qiaoming branches in Guangzhou, Qiaoming and Guangzhou factories in Foshan, Xinan Factory in Sanshui, Minsheng Factory in Nanhai, Guangming Factory in Jiangmen, and Minxing Factory in Qingyuan. The above eleven factories have more than 100,000 long-term workers and 70,000 to 80,000 temporary employees. If there is no way to resume production for a while, more than 100,000 workers will lose their jobs. The Match Industry Union has been holding meetings in recent days to discuss ways to maintain the industry and has convened representatives from both labor and capital. The capital side has proposed to cancel the wage increase conditions for the labor side in 1924 in order to maintain the business, but it has not yet been agreed to by the labor side. Based on this speculation, there is still no definite date for the factories to resume production. (February 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Zhu Jiahua's Speech on Transportation <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Beijing News: Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua delivered a speech at the Central Broadcasting Station at 6:00 PM today (the 15th) on "Transportation Projects Underway This Year." The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Central Broadcasting Station asked me to speak on the general situation of China's transportation industry last year, but only today did I have the time. I came to the Ministry of Transportation in the winter of the 21st year and believed that the transportation industry has a great relationship with the survival of the country and the lives of the people. Naturally, a conservative or downsizing policy cannot be adopted, but due to economic relations, we had to first find a way to maintain the status quo. Therefore, we started by reorganizing the internal affairs, such as rectifying the discipline of employees, implementing independent accounting, unifying the internal affairs of telecommunications, and establishing the foundation for the merger of postal and telecommunications services. We also abolished the shipping administration registration office, tightened up various postal and telecommunications agencies and the China Merchants Bureau, and the personnel administration of the Eurasia and China Airlines, etc., so that various businesses were commercialized, and administrative supervision was made strict and rapid, so as to gradually develop national undertakings. The difficulties in the postal service have now passed, and internal discipline has gradually recovered. The final accounts for the 22nd year even had a surplus of more than 1.2 million yuan. If the funds allocated to civil aviation are also included, it will be more than this amount. Compared with the heyday of the postal service in the past, it is no less inferior. However, the previous losses still have to be gradually made up. After the private postal offices were banned, the postal service has been truly unified from now on. In the field of telecommunications, a rough outline has also been sorted out in the past two years, and there has also been considerable progress. However, the economic foundation was originally too poor. Although all the old debts, large and small, have now been sorted out, because we also have to bear the principal and interest of repaying the old debts, there is currently no surplus to engage in larger expansions. As for the China Merchants Bureau in the field of shipping administration, the business performance has improved relatively, but due to various reasons, there are still many difficulties at present. In the field of civil aviation, Eurasia and China Airlines have expanded routes and economized expenses, and have even reached the point of suitable income and expenditure. China Airlines is now seeing improvement day by day. Now, at the beginning of the 24th year, let me briefly talk about the undertakings that are planned to be undertaken this year. At the same time, in order to understand the course of events, I cannot help but mention the past.</p>
<p>(A) Postal Service</p>
<p>The development of the postal service actually cannot but depend on the development of other transportation tools such as railways, highways, automobiles, and ships. However, as far as the postal service itself is concerned, China has a considerable foundation. The resolutions passed at the postal conference in September last year will continue to be implemented separately in the future. As for the more important matters to be carried out this year, (1) reorganize postal districts and expand the powers of the management bureau. The original postal districts were divided according to the previous transportation, political, and economic situation, which did not conform to the administrative regions very well. Now, because of the development of transportation undertakings such as highways, trains, aviation, telegraphs, and telephones, and the necessity of being consistent with the telecommunications districts after the merger of postal and telecommunications services last year, it is necessary to re-divide the postal districts. For example, the postal districts of Jiangsu and Anhui are vast, which is inconvenient. In terms of powers, because the postal business was not developed in the past, even an expenditure of several yuan had to be submitted to the Director of Postal Services of the General Post Office for approval, which could not give full play to its ability, and the General Post Office often reviewed it without understanding the local situation and needs, which had an impact on the development of the postal service. Now, regulations are being formulated to increase the responsibilities of the management bureau, so that ordinary events can be resolved on the spot, and events within the jurisdiction area should also be planned by them first, so that the General Post Office can concentrate on the responsibility of supervision and command, and will not be distracted by trivial matters. (2) Promote the postal service in the inland provinces and add bureaus and offices. The equipment in the inland bureaus and offices is still very simple, and there are still counties, townships, and towns that have not yet been opened to postal services, which should be reorganized or expanded separately. After all the private postal offices were closed at the end of last year, the postal administration bureaus of various provinces have added many third-class bureaus and agency offices in the inland, and they also deliver mail to places where no bureaus or offices have been set up for free. However, postal routes should still be opened up and bureaus and offices should be added. (3) Expand postal routes in border provinces. The establishment of bureaus and offices by the postal service has always been based on the principle of whether income and expenditure can be balanced. However, for the sake of developing the people's wisdom and culture in remote provinces, we should open up postal routes regardless of losses or strive for their development. For example, the postal affairs of Xikang are now being handled by personnel sent by the Sichuan Postal Administration Bureau. In the future, a management bureau or a first-class bureau will be set up in Kangding or Batang, directly under the Postal Administration Bureau. On the one hand, we will find ways to promote the entire postal service in Tibet. In the future, a management bureau must also be established in Lhasa. This matter is being discussed with the local authorities in Tibet, and it may be realized in a few months. Also, Qinghai is very vast, so a management bureau or a first-class bureau must also be established in Xining. (4) Build post office buildings. There are more than 2,300 post offices in the country (not including more than 10,000 agency offices). Only more than 80 of them have their own real estate. The others are rented private houses, which are not suitable. Therefore, we started to proceed with the design and construction of bureau houses in Nanchang, Changsha, Wuchang, Chengdu, Wuhu, Zhengzhou, Jiujiang, Shashi, Batang, Xining, and other important locations last year, and they will be completed in order. (5) The use of postal savings. Postal savings were more than 18 million yuan in the winter of the 21st year. The highest record before was more than 21 million yuan. Last year, due to the difficulty of safe investment, efforts were made to restrict it, and several provinces and regions stopped accepting savings. Now, the total has increased to more than 37 million yuan. At the same time, due to economic instability, for the benefit of depositors, investment has been specially restricted since the year before last, and large amounts of money have been deposited in reputable major banks, and a portion of the cash has been stored in the treasury. Therefore, the postal savings were not affected in the slightest by the financial crisis. However, this kind of savings comes from the people in various places and should not be used exclusively in urban areas. Therefore, we are now paying special attention to rural loans, so as to benefit farmers and ensure that loans are safe. Last year, the Hunan Post Office used a certain amount of money to be responsible for lending to rural areas by the bank. This year, we will try it out in several places. (6) Preparing for remittance of savings. The basic method of remittance of savings is that all deposits can be used to open a remittance account, and the post office will assign a number in turn. No matter who is in a general savings place, they can hand over the money to the post office and transfer it to the designated number. The China Post Office will notify the account holder of the number to withdraw it at any time, or ask for the deposit book to be recorded. Each time the remittance is taken, the job is clean, and merchants feel convenient. If both parties have this savings, they can hold the book and request direct remittance, one out and one in, without having to pay in cash, which is even more convenient. This method is available in various countries. The Ministry has also ordered preparations for it again and again last year. However, China's currency is not very uniform, and the market is different, so it is difficult to handle. However, preparations have been largely completed, and this year, it will be piloted in the six postal districts of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Beiping, and Shanghai, so as to gradually promote it. (7) Preparing for simple life insurance. The simple life insurance system can provide a considerable guarantee for the lives of poor people, and at the same time cultivate the habit of saving. The collected funds can be used to invest in local public utilities, directly and indirectly benefiting the society—especially the general public. Various countries have been running it for a long time, some are run by merchants, and some are run by post offices. Japan is quite developed, and it is run by the post office. The maximum amount of insurance is 450 yuan. At present, the total amount received is said to be more than 20 million yuan, and the national society has benefited greatly. The Ministry has drafted a plan, which is now being reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, and will be announced soon. The maximum amount of insurance is tentatively set at 900 yuan. Personnel who will handle this postal service will be trained next month. This year, it will be piloted in Nanjing and Shanghai first, and then gradually promoted. (8) Post offices purchase books, newspapers, and magazines on behalf of others. In order to subsidize cultural undertakings and facilitate the purchase of books and newspapers by people in various places, the Ministry formulated regulations and compiled a general catalog of books across the country last year. Post offices in various places have started purchasing on behalf of others from April last year and January this year. Because the publishing industry in China is not well organized, each publishing house publishes its own books, and the remittance procedures are cumbersome, which is especially inconvenient for people in the inland, which hinders the development of culture a lot. Now, it is extremely convenient to promote it through the post office, and it should be improved at any time in the future. (9) Drawing postal maps. The third edition of the postal map issued at the end of the year before last was revised based on the previous map. All the routes of ships, railways, automobiles, aviation, and telegraphs are recorded in more detail than before. However, in the past, postal maps were drawn by postal staff, focusing on the records of bureaus, offices, and lines. As for the terrain and humanities, everything was omitted, and there were inevitably errors. Also, some postal wall maps were drawn in the 10th year of the Republic of China and are no longer very suitable. Last year, the Ministry sent experts to the General Post Office to sort them out and redraw them, and asked the Land Survey Bureau and the Geographical Society to assist in the work. It is expected that they can be printed in about June or July. (10) Population survey. Post offices in China have always paid attention to the handling of population surveys and have published reports. Last year, statistical staff were sent to the General Post Office to plan properly and continue to handle them. It will be completed this autumn.</p>
<p>(B) Telecommunications</p>
<p>Telecommunications has also made considerable progress. The average monthly income of international radio was 150,000 yuan in the 21st year, and it increased to 330,000 yuan in the 23rd year. The average monthly income of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau is about 60,000 yuan. Together with the monthly income of 40,000 yuan from the Shanghai domestic radio station, it is 100,000 yuan per month. Now, it has increased to 170,000 yuan, and old materials, old machines, old poles, and old machines are being repaired and utilized as much as possible. Although the telecommunications equipment has been improved in many ways, it is still far from being completely modernized. Many cases were resolved at the telecommunications conference held in September last year, and they have been implemented in order. The matters to be realized this year are: (1) Complete the national important long-distance telephone trunk line. Since the establishment of the National Government, many provinces have been handling long-distance telephones. The opinions between the Ministry and the provinces often cannot be consistent. Therefore, we are now formulating measures to entrust the provincial governments to handle long-distance telephones on behalf of the Ministry, so that the business can be easily developed, and the national and provincial businesses will not conflict, so as to maintain the entire system of national long-distance telephones, and the economy will also be rational, so that long-distance telephones and wired telegraphs can be integrated. On the one hand, we will first determine the long-distance telephone trunk line plan for the nine provinces, so as to connect the telephone calls of the provinces. Last year, we successively completed the fund-raising and material purchase, etc. Now, it has been started, and most of it can be completed by the end of the year. It is also planned to extend the original plan to Xi'an, Taiyuan, and Lanzhou, so as to facilitate the transportation in the Northwest. In this plan, there was originally another project to expand the long-distance telephone network in Jiangsu Province. Later, some of the materials were transferred to Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. This year, the long-distance telephone network in these two provinces should be able to be completed in its entirety. In addition, it is planned to lay branch lines in Anhui and Henan provinces to complete the communication network. Now, long-distance telephones are being built between Wanxian and Chongqing, and wireless telephone stations are being built between Hankou and Chongqing. (2) Expansion of international radio stations. Since the winter of the 19th year, the business of international radio stations has been booming. Last year and in January this year, the three routes of China-UK, China-Japan, and China-Italy were opened successively, and the telegraph business was particularly prosperous. This year, we plan to negotiate with the telecommunications authorities of India, Australia, and Canada to open direct circuits. Therefore, in addition to the transceivers, there are also many international telegraphs in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou. It is also planned to set up automatic telegraph stations with lower power to communicate directly with neighboring places, such as Japan, the Philippines, and Annam. Thirteen 3.5-kilowatt transceivers have been purchased and installed in various places. On the one hand, they can communicate international telegraph business, and on the other hand, they can supplement the speed of domestic telegraph transmission. International wireless telephones have also been tested and will be put into commercial use in the past two years. The Ministry has set up a machine at the Shanghai International Radio Station to test the telephone calls with various countries in Europe and the United States, and the results are good. Because the secret machine and terminal machine have not arrived, it has not been officially opened. It can be completed this summer, and it is planned to install several smaller telephone stations to communicate with neighboring countries. At the same time, it is planned to install a wireless telephone station in Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Hankou. It should be able to communicate in May, so as to connect with long-distance telephones and city telephones in various places, and can be transferred to foreign countries from Shanghai. The Guangzhou telephone station is run by the Ministry. When it is completed in the future, Hong Kong and Shanghai can also communicate. It is also planned to install 12 wireless telephone stations in the inland and remote important locations to complete the initial completion of the national telephone network. (3) Reorganization of city telephones. City telephones have now been retrofitted with automatic machines in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Qingdao. As for the telephone bureaus in Suzhou, Zhenjiang, etc., the Nanchang Telephone Bureau, which was established last year, and the Xi'an Telephone Bureau, which is under construction, will all repair and apply the original manual machines in order to save costs. We are currently negotiating and expanding the Lanzhou and Yichang Telephone Bureaus, and plan to convert the Yantai and Wuhu Bureaus into common-battery type and expand them. The Chengdu Telephone Bureau will also be taken back, and we will start to add 1,000 common-battery type telephones. In addition, small magneto-type bureaus, such as Dongtai, Anyang, and Huaiyin, are being carried out successively and must be completed uniformly this year. (4) Improvement of telegraph business. In the past two years, trunk lines have been repaired more and machines in large bureaus have been replaced more. This year, it is planned to reorganize the branch lines and machines in small bureaus, and promote public telegraph ciphers, using one word to replace one word or one sentence, so as to reduce the number of words. For meteorological telegraphs, we will also consult with relevant agencies to reorganize them to ensure that they are fast and accurate. After the promulgation of the National Phonetic Telegraph, it has not been promoted, and the National Phonetic Standard has also been changed. In the past two years, the Ministry has compiled the National Phonetic Telegraph and recompiled it according to the new standard. It can be completed and promoted this year. (5) Expansion of the repair factory. The Ministry's Telecommunications Material Repair Factory has been established in Nanjing since last year and has now taken shape. This year, it is planned to expand it. We are now investigating the needs of telecommunications materials across the country, including those for military use, so as to gradually expand it. (6) Training of personnel. The Telecommunications School was suspended because it was not run properly. In addition, nearly 300 people have been dismissed or retired due to cases involving telegraph service personnel. Recently, the business has been gradually promoted, and the city telephones and long-distance telephones that have been taken back and newly established have increased day by day, and the demand for personnel has also increased. In the future, when the long-distance telephone business in the nine provinces is completed, the telephone service personnel must be technically trained in advance. Therefore, a training institute will be established in Beijing this year. On the one hand, we will transfer existing personnel from various places in batches for further training, and on the other hand, we will recruit qualified personnel. (7) Conducting publicity. The telecommunications agencies of the Ministry have complete equipment and convenient communication. Now, we plan to publicize transportation undertakings and pay attention to social and commercial news. We will also pay attention to international publicity. At the same time, we plan to set up broadcasting stations in major ports. The 10-kilowatt broadcasting station in Shanghai can be completed this summer. We are now planning the entire national broadcasting network. This matter is of great importance to education and cultural undertakings. We have also started to deal with the chaotic situation of various broadcasting stations in Shanghai, and the Wireless Radio Design Committee will be established in the shortest possible time to maintain the domestic spatial order and allocate broadcasting stations across the country into a complete plan.

<h3 id="e99">Zhejiang Province's Work Relief Road Construction <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>To Start Within This Month</p>
<p>Quzhou News: The work relief in this province was planned by the Construction Department last year, and the approved funding was 3 million yuan, with 1 million yuan for water conservancy, 600,000 yuan for road construction, and 400,000 yuan for agricultural improvement. The work relief funds for water conservancy and agricultural affairs have been determined by the competent department of the Construction Department for their use and distribution. As for the road construction, the work relief road construction is currently being surveyed. The Tongfen, Sanmen Bay branch line, and Anxiao and Jiaping and other five roads have been approved by the provincial government for implementation. The lengths of the five highways are: (1) Linhai to Xianju line, 15 kilometers; (2) Sanmen Bay branch line, 25.5 kilometers; (3) Linping to Jiaxing line, 95 kilometers; (4) Tonglu to Fenshui line, 42 kilometers; (5) Jiaxing to Huzhou line, 58.3 kilometers, totaling 265 kilometers. It is estimated that 2.78 million yuan will be needed for road construction. As of last month, the above five roads had not yet started construction because the contractors were all waiting to see if all the construction funds would be paid before they would agree to undertake the construction. Other work relief roads will also have to wait until the survey of these five roads is completed before they can continue to be handled. However, the recruitment of workers and road construction can only build the roadbed earthwork project. The pavement, bridge, and culvert projects still need to be contracted out. According to the Road Bureau, this work relief road construction is expected to start this month. (10th)</p>

<p>Two Prisoners Die Tragically in Prison</p>
<p>Zhao A'mei, a woman from Shihudang Township, was 21 years old. Last year, she went to Zhang's recommendation shop in Fuxiatang and was recommended to work as a servant in a certain family. Later, because Zhang demanded payment without success, he detained Zhao's clothes and bags, and a quarrel broke out. Then Zhang beat Zhao, who then bit off Zhang's finger. The case was reported to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the court. As a result, Zhao was sentenced to one year and two months in prison. However, Zhao was young and inexperienced. After entering prison, her injuries flared up, and her appearance gradually became haggard. Three months ago, she was coughing up blood and bedridden. Her family was poor and never came to visit her. She died in prison yesterday. After the inspection, she was put in a coffin for burial. Everyone who heard about it was saddened.</p>
<p>Also, Zhu Ziying and Diao Zizong from Xuzhou pretended to be members of the Public Security Bureau and extorted cigarette money from the Chen family's small teahouse in Chenjiaxing, Zhujingbang Township, in the name of catching gambling. The owner of the teahouse saw through them and turned them over to the nearby Public Security Bureau. They were transferred to the court, and Zhu was sentenced to two months in prison and Diao to 40 days in prison. It was reported that Zhu's old illness recurred and he died yesterday. After the judge's inspection, he was also put in a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Ministry of Communications Expands Long-Distance Telephone Lines</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the increasing improvement of domestic construction and the gradual completion of highway construction, believes that it is necessary to add more lines in various places and has ordered its subordinates to make preparations. It is learned that the Minhang Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau was established on February 6 and started telephone service. Minhang, Beiqiao, Zhuanqiao, Hupu, and Fushan also started telephone service on the 5th. The Liyang Long-Distance Telephone Business Office has been prepared and started telephone service on February 1. Telephones east of Wuxi are connected and transferred through Yixing, and Wuxi West Mountain Wujin Yixing connects and transfers. After the establishment of the Hushuguan Branch of the Wuxian Telegraph Bureau, it started business on February 1. A telegraph and telephone office was established in Xinzhen, a place between Kunshan and Taicang, on January 30 and started telephone service. The Danyang Long-Distance Telephone Office believes that the telephone service time at night is very short and there is only one telephone operator. It has specially petitioned the Ministry of Communications to stipulate the business hours. If there are air defense telephones and express telephones, they can be connected and transferred at any time. It has been tentatively decided that the telephone service hours for Danyang, Longtan, Taicang, and Kunshan will be from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. In addition to the original provincial long-distance telephone line between Wuxi, the Ministry of Communications will also hang a pair of phantom lines on the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway, which is expected to be connected to telephone service in March. The direct line of the Beijing-Hangzhou Road has been connected to telephone service on February 1.</p>
<p>Shell Explodes and Injures Two People</p>
<p>Zhang Shunxing Iron Shop outside Nanmen was opened by Zhang Renquan and is doing good business. Recently, the shop took in a batch of iron shells, about one foot long. Yesterday (the 16th) at about 8:00 AM, Zhang Renquan and his apprentice Zhou Fuxiang put the shells into the coal stove, preparing to transform them into other objects. Unexpectedly, the shell leaves were heated and suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, the roof tiles moved, and shrapnel flew everywhere. The shell pierced through the back wall and fell into the river. Zhang and Zhou were seriously injured in the face and other places and have been sent to Puren Hospital for treatment. It is said that their lives may be in danger.

<p>Huangtiangang Canal Dredging is Scheduled</p>
<p>The dredging of the South Canal of Huangtiangang is being actively carried out. The Construction Department sent engineer Yu Dejie and engineer Wu Xuexun to Cheng on the 14th, and the engineering office was established on the 15th and started working. It was decided to notify ships in various counties of Jiangsu Province from the 20th that they are not allowed to enter the port to facilitate the disconnection of the venue. Regarding the dredging cost budget, it is estimated that the total length from the mouth of Huangtiangang to Qingzhen is 26.85 kilometers, and the amount of excavated soil is about 793,000 cubic meters, which is divided into two types: machine excavation and manual excavation. The amount of soil excavated manually is about 700,000 cubic meters, which requires 7,100 coolies and workers to engage in excavation. The total cost is 160,000 yuan, which is allowed to be used from the 50,000 yuan of the Shu Yanzhen Wuyun River project account and the 15,000 yuan of the project account subsidized by the provincial government as resolved by the provincial government. The remaining 95,000 yuan will be borrowed from the local government and used as a ship donation for offsetting. Yesterday (the 14th), Magistrate Yan of the Mountain County, together with Chen Zhisan and Liu Chiying of the Farmers Bank of China, and Chairman Wu Shuying of the Chamber of Commerce, went to Wuxi to borrow money from the China Shanghai Banks. The result was good. The Construction Department also instructed the county government that the method of offsetting the borrowed cash is feasible in principle. However, the third item, the request to allocate a new public bond of 50,000 yuan for borrowing, should be transferred to the Water Conservancy Construction Public Bond Supervision and Use Committee of this province for review, and Magistrate Yan was appointed as the deputy director of the project account office, responsible for handling it.</p>

<p>Victim Fights Robbers, Both Sides Injured</p>
<p>The Huangni Bridge area in the Third District, close to the lake marshlands, has many bandits. The family of Zhang Abing, a farmer in that area, is relatively well-off. Unexpectedly, they were robbed. The victim, Zhang, seeing that the robbers were mostly unarmed, fought back. Unfortunately, it was late at night and there was a lack of assistance, and the robbers relied on their numbers. Zhang Abing and his son, Jinsheng, were both severely beaten, their heads broken and bleeding. The robbers then searched and looted miscellaneous items, taking everything, totaling a loss of approximately seven to eight hundred yuan. On the 15th, the two victims came to the city to seek treatment at the county hospital and reported the robbery to the county police.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Financial Advisory Committee Established Yesterday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>First Meeting Held, Deputy Chairman and Committee Members Appointed</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Financial Advisory Committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon at Minister Kong's private residence. The committee members present were Minister Kong, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Xing, Tang Shumin, Li Fusun, Chen Guangfu, Qian Xinzhi, Hu Bijang, Xu Xinliu, Ju Songsun, Xu Kan, Song Ziliang, Xi Demao, Qin Runqing, Chen Zheqing, Qian Changzhao, Shen Shuyu, Wu Yunzhai, and Ye Fuxiao. After the meeting began as scheduled, Minister Kong delivered an opening speech, saying that today is the day of the establishment of the Financial Advisory Committee, and he has endless thoughts and hopes. The current Chinese economy and finance do have many difficult problems. In essence, these difficult problems mostly arise from the lack of a sound foundation in China's economy and finance. The public must think that this committee will solve many of the current problems. However, his purpose is to hope that everyone will use their accumulated experience and intellect to jointly study and build a sound economic foundation for China. However, everyone is very busy and sacrifices their precious time, which he feels ashamed of. Because China's economic organization does not have a sound foundation, any novel foreign policies, which sound very appealing, will inevitably be unsuitable once implemented. Therefore, any plan to remedy China's economy and finance must be suitable for China's national conditions. Arbitrarily imitating others will not only be useless but may also increase difficulties. We must know that we are a backward country and must first do a lot of basic construction work before we can be on par with other countries. In other words, we should first maximize the development and utilization of our inherent resources to make the entire national economy deeply rooted. At the same time, we should base the economic construction plan on national habits and social development processes and adopt economic policies. Not only must we have a thorough understanding of the domestic situation, but we must also be well-versed in the trends of the world economy. Because today the economies of all countries in the world have close interrelationships. Everyone is a leader in the banking and business sectors and has a keen observation of domestic and foreign business conditions. In the future, this committee will be able to provide appropriate suggestions to the government's construction plans by considering both Chinese and foreign situations. The government will also humbly adopt them. Recently, the government officials in charge have repeatedly declared their financial policies: First, they will never lightly use superficial shortcuts to solve the basic problems of our country's current finance and economy. Second, they will never adopt extreme measures that would shake the people's credit and hinder the future of economic construction. At the same time, we should also recognize that there are areas for improvement in China's currency and financial organization. Now, domestic trade between producers and merchants in various regions is still unable to fully develop due to the lack of adequate financial regulation. Therefore, we must carefully improve the current issuance system to obtain a more unified, stable, and widely circulating currency. In addition, we should set up more financial institutions and agricultural warehouses in the inland, and implement bill discounting to make inland finance more active. There is also the matter of the government's great anxiety about our country's huge trade deficit. Although there is no way to remedy it in the short term, we must always actively find ways to gradually stabilize foreign trade. This committee should provide practical suggestions to meet the government's expectations. Therefore, the scope of work of this committee is very broad, and the responsibility entrusted to this committee by the government is very heavy. At the same time, the government is very grateful for everyone's loyal service. Then, the chairman, in accordance with the law, appointed Committee Member Zhang Gongquan as Deputy Chairman and appointed the committee members of each group. The first group includes Tang Shouliang, Chen Xing, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Kan, Qian Xinzhi, and Wu Daquan, with Tang Shumin as the director. The second group includes Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, Wu Yunzhai, and Shen Shuyu, with Bei Songsun as the director. The third group includes Li Fusun, Qian Changzhao, Song Ziliang, Xu Xinliu, and Ye Fuxiao, with Li Fusun as the director. The fourth group includes Chen Guangfu, Hu Bijang, Qin Runqing, Zhou Zuomin, Chen Zheqing, with Chen Guangfu as the director. Zhang Gongquan expressed his best efforts to serve as the vice chairman of the council. He hoped that the members of each group would focus on basic issues, conduct research and discussion, and contribute to the government. This council is an advisory body to the Ministry of Finance. Chairman Kong concurrently served as the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank. Committee Member Xu Keting is the Director of the Currency Department. He hoped the committee relationship would bring the Ministry of Finance, the banking community, and society together to sincerely cooperate to overcome national difficulties. Then, Chairman Kong proposed that the National Federation of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Silver and Money Trade Association petitioned the Ministry of Finance to reward the import of foreign silver and exempt the new silver export tax added in October of the 23rd year when re-exporting. After discussion, it was deemed necessary to reward it. It was resolved that it could be approved, but it was still requested that the Ministry of Finance make a decision. Subsequently, Chairman Kong reported that the address of the committee would be attached to the Central Bank, and all secretarial affairs would be handled concurrently by the Secretariat of the Central Bank. Then the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Going to Hangzhou Tonight</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters in the Afternoon</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: Dr. Yan Huiqing, our country's ambassador to Russia, returned to China and has been on vacation in the country for several months. He is now scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 20th of this month to return to his post. Mr. Yan arrived in Shanghai by train from Tianjin yesterday morning. He accepted the invitation of the Soviet Russian representative and is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hangzhou tonight. After returning to Shanghai tomorrow, he will attend a tea party hosted by Minister Kong, Mayor Wu, and Minister Gu tomorrow night. Then he will go abroad with Mei Lanfang and others. Mr. Yan met with reporters yesterday and expressed his pleasure at returning to his post. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Mr. Yan took the train from Tianjin southwards a few days ago, without any attendants. He did not stop when passing through Beijing the night before and came directly to Shanghai, arriving at the North Station at 8:20 yesterday morning. After getting off the train, he took a car directly to Room 345 on the 13th floor of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to rest. Those who welcomed him at the train station included Zhao Tiezhang, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai, Qian Xinzhi, General Manager of the Four Banks Savings Society, Yan Fuqing, President of the National Shanghai Medical College, and many relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Go to Russia</p>
<p>The "Northern" special ship sent by the Soviet Union to welcome Mr. Yan and the Mei's opera troupe left Vladivostok and headed south on the 8th, arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the 14th. After Mr. Yan arrived in Shanghai, he has decided to take the ship immediately without changing his plans. Now, he is only waiting for Mr. Mei Lanfang to finish the charity performance for the China Benevolent Childcare Association and the Jiangzhe Drought Relief Association and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 20th. It is estimated that it will take 25 to 26 days to reach Vladivostok, where he will transfer to a special Siberian railway train and arrive in Moscow before March 1st.</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel</p>
<p>In addition to the Mei's opera troupe and Miss Hu Die and others who are going to Russia to attend the International Film Exhibition, those traveling to Russia with Mr. Yan include the newly appointed Third Secretary of the Embassy in the Soviet Union, Jiao Xiangzong, the former President of the Qingdao Physicians Association, attendant Wu Gang, the wife of the current Chargé d'Affaires in the Soviet Union Wu Nanru, Secretary Wei's wife, the wife of Xu Nianceng, the Consul-General in Khabarovsk, and the couple of Tian Kuanqi, the Vice Consul in Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Russian Consulate Banquet</p>
<p>Mr. Spilvanik, the Soviet Russian Consul-General and Chargé d'Affaires in Shanghai, welcomed Ambassador Yan and Mei Lanfang and others at the Soviet Russian Embassy office at No. 1 Huangpu Road at 12:30 yesterday afternoon. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai Yu Ming, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, former Minister to France Chen Lu, and local celebrities Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and Russian Vice Consul Zhurikovsky and others accompanied the banquet, which ended at around 2 pm.</p>
<p>Tea Party Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>Central dignitaries such as Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Minister to France Gu Weijun, former Minister to France Chen Lu, Central Committee Member Cai Yuanpei, former Minister of Railways Ye Gongchao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, as well as Feng Gengguang, Du Yuesheng, Shen Shuyu, Yuan Ludeng, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Yin, Li Zhaohuan, Li Xuangong, Li Yuying, Yang Hu, Jin Tingsun, Lin Kanghou, Qian Yongming, Pan Gongzhan, Bei Zuyi, Xu Shiying, Chen Guangfu, Yu Ming, Xu Xinliu, Chen Qicai, Liu Zhanen, Zhang Zhuping, Wu Zaizhang, Zhang Shouyong, Wang Xiaolai, Ma Yinliang, Shen Kunshan, Zhao Zunyu, Zhang Jia'ao, Tang Shumin, Chen Jie, Li Denghui, Wang Boqi, Zhang Wenhuan, Xiong Xiling, Yu Zuoting, Hu Yun, Zhu Shaoping, Yu Qiaqing, Yu Hongjun, and more than forty others, have jointly invited Ambassador Yan, Mei Lanfang, and other related Chinese and Russian figures to a grand tea party at the International Hotel from 4:30 pm to 6:30 pm tomorrow to bid farewell to the two gentlemen.</p>
<p>Remarks</p>
<p>Mr. Yan met with reporters at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon. He said that he had been abroad for more than two years before, returned to China to take care of private affairs, and inspected the domestic situation. Later, due to physical discomfort, he was unable to return to his post earlier. Recently, his health has gradually recovered. He did not intend to return to his post, but considering that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia was entirely negotiated by him and Litvinov in the League of Nations, and that he was appointed as the first ambassador to Russia after the resumption of diplomatic relations for only a year or so, it would seem unreasonable to resign suddenly. At the same time, the government also found it difficult to find a successor for a while, and the embassy staff in the Soviet Union also hoped that he would return to his post. Therefore, he decided to return to his original post.</p>
<p>Close Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>Mr. Yan continued that after the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the exchanges between the two sides have been very close. Not only in culture, our country often has military, transportation, education, municipal, and military attaché groups going to inspect. In terms of commerce, it is also very progressive. He recently heard that the Soviet Union is now ordering 4,000 tons of Chinese tea, and the import of Russian coal, wood, and so on is also a good phenomenon in the diplomatic relations between the two countries. This time, Russia invited Mei Lanfang and others to perform, which will further promote the development of culture between China and Russia. Therefore, he feels quite happy about this trip. As for the Chinese tea merchants, he hopes that they can unite, which will be more powerful in international trade.</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Diplomacy</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Russian diplomacy, Mr. Yan said that our country has always opposed the Middle East Railway issue and has repeatedly protested. The Sino-Russian Commercial Treaty is in progress in Beijing. It can continue after the Russian ambassador returns to his post.</p>
<p>International Situation</p>
<p>Mr. Yan finally said that Sheng Shicai, the administrator of Xinjiang, once invited him to go to Xinjiang, but it was not possible in reality. He plans to go there if he has the opportunity after arriving in Russia. Regarding Sino-Japanese relations and Hirota's speech, we need to see how things develop. Our country is a passive party in this matter, and Japan needs to be aware of it. The first step is to improve the atmosphere. Before the September 18th Incident, the two countries were very good. Therefore, to improve Sino-Japanese relations and not let them remain in a stalemate for a long time, we must first understand the cause and effect. As for Anglo-American cooperation, in terms of language, religion, economy, race, and history, there is a possibility, but the scope is too broad. The interests of the two countries in the Far East will of course be maintained. Even as the US ambassador stated, Britain's Far East policy has not changed, which means that it supports its consistent position. But we cannot hope to borrow others for assistance. This concept is indeed impossible and not what an independent country should have. Lord Lytton is an enthusiastic person, and his remarks are only to maintain the claims in his investigation report. Therefore, Mr. Li paid close attention to the affairs of Kwantung when he was in the UK to show that he always supported his report.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Sun Ke Discusses the Issue of Far Eastern Peace <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Anglo-American Alliance Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by train the night before to bid farewell to Central Committee Member Wang Longhui, who is going abroad. Mr. Sun met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road yesterday morning. According to him, Mr. Wang Chonghui's task of running around the North and South of the country has been completed, and he is now returning to his post via Japan and the United States because his vacation is over. The collection of transaction taxes has precedents in various countries, but it is still a new tax in our country. Therefore, the tax rate is light. At present, the Regulations on Transaction Tax of the Exchange have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and will be implemented soon. Lord Lytton advocated the Anglo-American alliance to maintain peace in the Far East, but considering the facts, this statement is difficult to realize. The British Conservative Party recently advocated not to care about matters east of Singapore and to abandon the Singapore naval base to avoid war. The Labor Party advocates thorough peace, which is close to compromise. The attitude of the United States is also very ambiguous. From this point of view, it is difficult for Britain and the United States to unite to maintain peace in the Far East. However, if Britain and the United States continue to maintain the attitude of the past three years and hold the principle of seeking nothing, then within five years, Britain and the United States will have no foothold in the Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e111">US Far East Commercial Investigation Group Will Come to China <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>March 22nd</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports: It was learned today (16th) that the Far East Commercial Investigation Group organized by the American Foreign Trade Association in New York will depart from San Francisco on a Dollar Company邮船 on March 22nd. This trip will pay special attention to China and will strive to promote the commercial relations between the United States and China and Japan. After arriving in Japan, they will stay for two weeks. Although Manchuria is not included in the itinerary, several members may separate from the main group and go for an informal investigation. Several other members may go south to Manila. After arriving in China, they will stay for six weeks or two months to conduct detailed investigations in various places to achieve the purpose of this trip. The current plan is to form the group with 15 to 25 important merchants, and several secretaries and experts will accompany them.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Minutes of the Annual Meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The China Press reports that the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held its annual meeting yesterday (15th) at the American Community Center. Chairman Françoise briefly described the difficult period that the world, especially China, is currently going through. Last year, the American Chamber of Commerce requested the Chinese government to revise a certain clause of the Regulations on Encouraging Industry. The US Minister to China has received a notice stating that some modifications will be made. In addition, the troublesome clauses in the laws requiring goods imported into China to be labeled with the country of manufacture will also be relaxed. Furthermore, the certification of passport regulations, which is particularly inconvenient for those who go to the Philippines or Japan several times a year, is also under consideration for revision to give those who live in China the same treatment as Chinese living in the United States. One noteworthy item in the Chamber of Commerce's accounts last year was the relief work it carried out. The total amount used for relief, loans, and sending impoverished American expatriates back to their country throughout the year was 17,869 yuan and 81 cents. After the description, the members voted to approve the amendments to the charter proposed by the special committee. The main amendment was to increase the number of directors from 11 to 15. All the clauses were unanimously passed by the entire meeting. Then, Francoise and 14 others were elected as the new directors. Next, Frischman of the Shanghai Telephone Company stated that the company recently submitted a request to the工部局 to increase telephone charges, which is only to fulfill the contract signed three times before. In the past three years, the company's income has not been able to cover its expenses, so it feels that Shanghai users should fulfill that part of the contract. The new charter charges according to the number of calls, so the increased cost is borne by those who use the telephone more, and users in residential areas or those who use less water do not have to pay more. This method is very fair. Next, American Commercial Counselor Arnold detailed his observations on his return to the United States, saying that the people have mixed opinions on the new government, but in his personal opinion, things are indeed better than before. Next, he said that in order to increase the export trade of the United States, we must first seek to increase purchases, because buying and selling are mutually dependent. The extreme nationalism that has gradually expanded in recent years is no longer applicable today. As for the economic depression, he believes that the United States is now gradually approaching the period of turning from bad to good. Based on the statistics and other signs of 1934, he believes that it is now the time for the Chamber of Commerce to plan for development and strive to cooperate with Chinese and other countries. Next, he mentioned that the American Economic Investigation Group will depart from New York around March 18th to come to China. The members are all important figures in the business community and are very concerned about commercial issues here. After Arnold finished his speech, member Balenman suggested that a committee should be established to study China's export trade, but member Barsha said that this move is hopeless because the Chinese government never cares about exporters and often troubles merchants who try to increase China's export trade by imposing donations and increasing export taxes, even though the development of export trade can enable tens of millions of Chinese to obtain jobs and can bring new capital into China. However, the Chinese government does not regard encouraging this move as its task.</p>

It has assisted in various construction projects and exerted its efforts. Last year, it established a large loan for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway with the Ministry of Railways, so that the construction of the road could be completed as soon as possible. Therefore, it has made great contributions to the country and society. It is now heard that Mr. Song believes that China's industry and commerce have been affected by the world economic depression in recent years and are mostly declining. If they are not given practical assistance, the future is unlikely to be optimistic. Therefore, in this year's business progress, the company will try its best to invest in various industries and commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Anti-Drug Conference Resolves Four Important Cases <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Chairman of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, Wang Yingqi, Vice Chairmen Li Denghui, Zhong Ketuo, General Manager Huang Jiahe, and others held a tea party yesterday at the 14th-floor restaurant of the International Grand Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to entertain the association's committee members and anti-drug leaders. Over twenty people attended, including Xue Dubi, Chu Fucheng, Wu Kaisheng, Yin Zhufu, He Dekui, Liu Wang Liming, and Li Gongpu. Li Denghui and Zhong Ketuo successively gave speeches, briefly stating that the association's launch of the National Anti-Drug Movement has lasted over a decade. Its advocacy and undertakings have been witnessed by the people of the country. In recent years, due to environmental factors, the work has been slightly stagnant. Recently, the government has implemented a drug prohibition movement and a six-year eradication plan. The association should continue its efforts to jointly supervise and promote the complete eradication. They also expressed hope that all attendees would provide guidance on future plans and strategies. Huang Jiahe then reported on the association's recent work progress, and put forward ten proposals regarding the prohibition of opium. Chu Fucheng advocated that Shanghai, as a place of observation for both Chinese and foreigners, and also the center of opium, should be subject to the association's request to the authorities to strictly eradicate drugs to eliminate the root cause of the disaster. Subsequently, Wu Kaisheng, the former representative attending the International League of Nations Opium Suppression Conference, delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association is the only anti-drug organization in China. Its past statements were bright and its advocacy was righteous, which was valued by the International League of Nations and various countries. All countries in the world know that China has this anti-drug association. In the past, for China's opium prohibition issues, many cited the association's proposals and reports as the basis. He himself, when attending the International Opium Suppression Conference in Europe, received a lot of help from the writings of the association's General Manager Huang, and other representatives also benefited from the association's documents. This shows the association's international status. In the future, they should unite comrades and provide spiritual and material support to expand its work, strive for opium prohibition, and win glory for the country. Xue Dubi gave a speech, briefly stating that he knew the association's work when he served in the northwestern provinces, and later, as Minister of Interior, he co-founded the Anti-Smoking Committee with the association's members, drafted the anti-smoking law, and deeply knew the association's deep relationship with China's opium prohibition. Currently, the government has announced a six-year eradication plan, and the association should request the government to implement it. Yin Zhufu then reported on his experience traveling to Shaanxi and praised the province's authorities for prohibiting the planting of opium and changing to planting cotton. He hoped that the province could persist to the end, extending from the first phase of 41 counties to the entire province, and that the association should work hard to promote its realization. Finally, the following resolutions were made: (1) Organize a Narcotics Research Committee; (2) Hold a grand anti-drug movement on June 3rd of this year, Lin Zexu Memorial Day; (3) Continue to publish the International Anti-Drug Newsletter; (4) Publicly elect Xue Dubi, Wang Jingqi, Chu Fucheng, Li Denghui, Zhong Ketuo, Wu Kaisheng, Huang Jiahe, and other seven people to revise the association's declaration on opium prohibition, and elect Huang Jiahe as the convener. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Huang Musong Arrived in Beijing Yesterday Morning <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Northwest Problem Research Association Gave a Farewell Banquet to Mr. Huang the Night Before</p>
<p>Huang Musong, the special envoy specially appointed by the Central Government to Tibet to pay tribute to the distant Dalai Lama, returned to China last winter via India and Nepal. He landed in Hong Kong at the beginning of this month, traveled to Guangdong for a short tour, and arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Changxing Company's Asia Queen ship the day before yesterday. He took the early train to Beijing at 8:00 yesterday morning to report everything to the Central Government. The Northwest Problem Research Association held a banquet to welcome Mr. Huang at the Banking Club on the fifth floor of the Bank Association at 6:00 the night before yesterday (the 15th). Over forty people attended, including Lin Kanghou, Chen Binhe, Pan Gongzhan, Yin Zhufu, Guo Weiping, Gao Changzhu, Wang Yuzhuang, Li Dachao, Pan Dajing, Wang Weisong, Dai Yuheng, Huang Jingwan, Ma Hongdao, Xu Zhaoxian, Li Shuqing, and Chen Yunsuan. First, Lin Kanghou delivered a welcome speech, briefly stating that Mr. Huang had worked hard for the country, traveled to the northwest, and provided a lot of support to the association. This time, he went to Tibet to pay tribute to the Dalai Lama, traveled for six or seven months, lasting a whole year. Although it was said to be full of hardships, it deepened the feelings between China and Tibet, completed the mission successfully, and returned with honor. This is the first reason why the association should express a warm welcome. Although the association's members are determined to study border affairs, it is difficult to obtain accurate information. Mr. Huang's trip, experiences, and insights are naturally accurate and rich, and can be used as research materials for us in every way. We have a new guide. This is the second reason for a warm welcome. Border issues should be studied with the attention of the Chinese people. Therefore, we hope that the government leaders who manage border affairs will provide us with practical materials at any time within the scope of possibility, so that the conclusions of the research will not contradict the actual situation of the border. Then, Mr. Huang stood up and gave a speech, roughly saying that border issues are indeed important issues for China today. He has always been interested in them. This trip to Tibet was mainly spent on the road, so the observation time was very short. In general, he felt that the people of Tibet were simple and sincere, with a strong inward feeling, which was very good. At the same time, he felt that there were three advantages in the relationship between China and Tibet that were gratifying: (1) Tibet and China have a long history of more than 2,000 years, and the past feelings were very good, so the inward feeling is strong. This is the first advantage. (2) The border policies of China's past dynasties have all adopted a policy of appeasement and provided practical assistance to the border people. The Tibetan people are very grateful for this kind of policy. This kind of lenient border policy is the second advantage. (3) China's national spirit has always upheld humanity, justice, and equality for all five ethnic groups in the country under the current Prime Minister, which is beyond the reach of foreign countries and makes the Tibetan people more determined to look inward. This great spirit of nation-building is the third advantage. Since China has these three advantages, it can move the border people, and the anesthesia and temptation of foreigners are not easy to implement. Although China has these three advantages, border issues cannot be considered resolved from now on. We should continue to restore, preserve, and promote this good historical nation-building spirit and border governance policy, and further achieve the ability to provide substantial assistance and protection, so that the border people will not feel foreign oppression and have other concerns. Then, the inward-looking heart can be permanently strengthened. If there are only the above three advantages without substantial assistance, it will still be difficult to solve today's border issues. However, the cultivation of this strength depends on the efforts of the compatriots across the country, and I especially hope that the gentlemen of the Northwest Problem Research Association will lead and promote it, and look forward to its success. This is an important matter that I felt this time. As for the geography, religion, politics, economy, society, customs, etc. of Tibet, there is no shortage of things to talk about, but due to time constraints, I can't say everything at once. I will contribute to you in detail later when I have the opportunity to serve as a reference for research. I hope everyone will work hard, and I am willing to follow behind and do my best. Next, the members successively raised various questions, and Mr. Huang answered them one by one, discussing each other. There were also many important reports and interesting lectures on the details of Nepal, India, Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and the Philippines. The guests and hosts dispersed at 9:30 pm, all in good spirits.</p>

<p>Another Meeting Was Held Yesterday to Elect Important Officials</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese Tourism Delegation to the Philippines held another meeting yesterday at 4:30 pm in the conference room on the third floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the previous meeting, before departure. Over twenty people attended, including Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Songyuan, Zhu Shaoping, Chen Xiaodie, Xu Xiaochu, and Wang Tianshen. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai first stood up and reported that, as of now, applications have been submitted and approved for those who will board the President Jackson ship on the afternoon of the 19th and set sail for the Philippines on the morning of the 20th. They include Chen Songyuan and his wife, Pan Gongzhan and his wife, Wang Xiaolai and his wife, Chen Xiaodie and his wife, Xu Xiaochu and his wife, You Jusun, Wang Tianshen, Chen Xiangtao, Du Jinsheng, Zhu Shaoping, Zheng Fangzheng, Zheng Xuejun, Mao Heyuan, Le Fucheng, Zai Yizhong, Zhong Guoquan, Yao Xijiu, Chen Yonglin, Wang Yanqing, and Sun Lanting, totaling twenty-six people. In addition, the head of the delegation, Mr. Wang Rutang, has already gone to the Philippines in advance and will meet in Manila.

<p>The members of the delegation are now going through the procedures for obtaining passports. Those who do not have blue robes and black jackets will have their sizes measured at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce after the meeting and rush to make them. The top hats are all made in China, light-colored felt hats. Also, because the rooms are double rooms, members can freely choose to report to the Chief Secretary to share a room, except for couples, to avoid loneliness during the journey. Various promotional materials are also being rushed to be printed. The meeting ended at about 6:00 pm.</p>
<h3 id="e118">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Jing-Wu Railway Jointly Operate Water-Land Intermodal Transport <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Effective March 5th</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) has signed water-land intermodal transport agreements with various railways, which have been implemented in sequence. The commercial operation of the intermodal transport between CMSNC and the Jiangnan Railway Company's Jing-Wu (Nanjing-Wuhu) line, after Mr. Zhou Fengtu signed the intermodal transport regulations with the Jiangnan Company, has now taken a further step. The intermodal transport fee has been negotiated. The Jiangnan Railway Company specially dispatched Section Chief Zhou of the Traffic Section to Shanghai to negotiate and sign the implementation date of the intermodal transport with CMSNC. It was decided yesterday that the intermodal transport will be implemented simultaneously in Shanghai and Wuhu from March 5th. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Intermodal Transport Locations</p>
<p>The intermodal transport locations agreed upon by CMSNC and the Jiangnan Railway Company, belonging to the land transport of the railway side, are nine stations in Wuhu: Dongmen (East Gate), Kazikou, Zhusizhuang, Miaojiazhuang, Wanzhi, Xiaogan, Wangjia, Xuancheng, and Sunjiabu. In the future, if the railway tracks are extended, CMSNC will be notified at any time. The intermodal transport locations belonging to the waterway, carried by CMSNC ships, are eleven ports: Hankou, Jiujiang, Datong, Anqing, Zhenjiang, Yantai, Tianjin, Ningbo, Shantou, Guangdong, and Shanghai (Nanjing was also included before the Jing-Wu line was opened to traffic).</p>
<p>Implementation Date</p>
<p>The goods transported by the Jiangnan Railway Company are mostly agricultural products. Wuhu's rapeseed and miscellaneous grains are the largest commodities. Xuancheng's paper is famous throughout the country but has not yet been transported to various places. In the past, inland sailing ships were used, which were expensive and delayed. Japanese merchants who came to purchase goods faced difficulties and spent a lot of time and money. Now that the Jiangnan Railway has been built, the difficulties of the past have been eliminated. Not only is transportation fast, but also the handling of export financing is possible, which has great benefits for the economy and production. The success of this water-land intermodal transport can not only recover the leakage of foreign shipping competition, but also reduce transportation costs. It has been decided that the road and sea will be implemented simultaneously in Shanghai and Wuhu from March 5th.</p>
<p>Low Freight Rates</p>
<p>Zhou Fengtu, the director of intermodal transport at CMSNC, spent several months consulting and painstakingly negotiating intermodal transport fees with the Traffic Section of the Railway Bureau, taking into account the interests of the cargo owners and reducing freight rates. The freight rates for various goods have been set, roughly divided into two categories: whole car and separate load. The unit of a whole car is ten or sixteen tons. Detailed price lists are available in separate "tariffs," which can be requested from the intermodal transport section of the Railway Bureau and CMSNC, or from various stations and branch offices. The loading of freight cars is divided into six links, and the procedures are very cautious. The payment of intermodal transport fees has been agreed to be divided into two types: prepaid and payable upon arrival, both of which can be chosen at the customer's convenience.</p>
<p>Connecting the Capital</p>
<p>The Jing-Wu Railway has been completed from Wuhu Dongmen to Sunjiabu. The railway tracks facing Nanjing are also being connected to the capital. According to Section Chief Zhou of the Traffic Section, the small train in Nanjing City has been leased by the Jiangnan Railway for a period of twenty years. Currently, the Jing-Wu section is actively under construction to connect the railway tracks with the Nanjing small train line. However, because there are walls and houses blocking the junction, the company is in the process of buying, dismantling, and repaving the tracks. The capital can be reached outside Nanjing City in March, and the railway will be connected to the capital railway in May. After the completion of the Jing-Wu Railway, the transportation of Anhui goods will be even more convenient.</p>
<p>Recovering Shipping Rights</p>
<p>In the past, foreign merchants engaged in a large amount of cargo transportation within the Yangtze River line. Among them, the British and Japanese companies had an advantage in the transshipment to various ports in the South and North Seas. Now that the Jiangnan Railway and CMSNC are jointly operating intermodal transport, the shipment of Anhui goods to the South and North Seas will seize the business of foreign merchants and switch to domestic ships, which will greatly recover shipping rights. Foreign shipping companies in this port, upon hearing the news of the intermodal transport on February 5th, wanted to strike first and had already reduced the freight for Anhui goods to various ports in the South Seas by 20% in order to compete and try to save their business.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group Holds a Ceremony Today</p>
<h3 id="e120">Completion Ceremony of the Cenotaph for Four Martyrs <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Change of Reception Location</p>
<p>Various Sectors Sent Eulogies</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group will hold a completion ceremony for the cenotaph of four martyrs, Luo Yunxiang, Mao Weixiang, Ying Wenda, and Bao Zhengwu, at 10:00 am today in the Shanghai Cemetery in Jiangwan. Various sectors were invited in advance to participate and share in the grand event. At the same time, a special issue on the completion of the cenotaph for the four martyrs was edited and distributed to various sectors at the cemetery. It was reported that the group originally planned to set up a reception area on Baoshan Road, but now it has been changed to board the train at the former Songhu Station inside the North Station due to the narrow space there. It was also reported that various sectors deeply mourned the sacrifice of the four martyrs for the country and sent eulogies, including from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yang Hu, Ye Mojun, Ye Jiaxing, Shen Zechun, Wu Yunqi, the Municipal North Middle School, the Sugar Industry Association, and many others. It was reported that the reception train was also changed to depart from the North Station at 8:10 am today.</p>
<p>The original inscription of the cenotaph for the four martyrs is as follows: "When the Northeast was lost, our group felt the urgency of the day of national decline and remembered our responsibility. We worked hard to prepare, and on the night of January 28, the Japanese led dozens of aircraft and more than 10,000 marines to attack the prosperous Zhabei of our city. The citizens were slaughtered, their houses turned to ashes, the soldiers struggled in the hail of bullets, and the women and children groaned in the broken walls and wells. Suffering such devastation, the whole country was indignant. At that time, comrades raised their arms in response, and the refugee relief team, the frontline transport team, the rear service team, and the fireline stretcher team were immediately established. The next day, a collective meeting was held, and more than a hundred people decided to sacrifice their occupations, property, families, and lives to be loyal to the country and wrote oaths in blood. At that time, senior member Luo Yunxiang served as the leader of the seventh group of the rescue team, leading intermediate members Ying Wenda, Mao Zhengxiang, and Bao Zhengwu to rush to the war zone to rescue the wounded soldiers and civilians, saving more than a hundred people. Alas, who would have thought that after departing on the morning of January 31, they would not return for a long time. The refugees reported that they had been captured. Under public indignation, they were rescued in all directions. The enemy, fearing justice, pretended to promise to investigate and release them, but secretly falsely accused them of being spies and killed them. Alas, the martyrs' ambitions were not fulfilled, and their loyal bones were destroyed. Their noble spirit will last forever, and their heroic souls will not perish. We mourn the loss of our good friends as national heroes and have become forever separated. We encourage our comrades to continue their legacy and swear to avenge the family feud. Recalling the meaning of diligently serving the country until death, there should be sacrifices and worship for thousands of years. Therefore, together with the Chinese Red Cross Society, we built a cenotaph for the four martyrs in the Shanghai Cemetery in Jiangwan, this city, to promote their loyalty and bravery and to serve as an example. This is the inscription."</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Has Already Issued an Order to Comply</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, the captain of the recruitment team of the China Aviation Association, in order to actively promote the association's affairs and conduct recruitment, sent a letter to the municipal government requesting that it order all its affiliated agencies to instruct their staff to participate in the aviation salvation movement. Yesterday, it was learned that the municipal government had replied to the office that it had ordered all its affiliated staff to participate. The original letter is excerpted as follows: "In accordance with your letter, in order to hold the second aviation salvation recruitment movement, please instruct your staff to participate. This should be complied with. In addition to issuing separate orders, we hereby reply for your information."</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Daily Newspaper Reports That Doihara Will Be Appointed Military Attaché to China <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Expression of the Japanese Army's Independent China Policy</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that the army will elect officers in March and is currently assessing personnel in the personnel bureau. Among the generals expected to be transferred, Lieutenant General Suzuki, the military attaché to the Chinese Embassy, will be transferred back to Japan and replaced by Doihara. The recent inspection of North China and central China by Major General Doihara is quite relevant, so it has been rumored for a long time. However, the appointment of Doihara as military attaché to China and the courageous retirement of Minister Ariyoshi are both subtly related. Minister Ariyoshi's return to his country will be after May. On the one hand, the inspection of North China by Major General Isotani, the second director of the General Staff Headquarters, and Lieutenant Colonel Kusumoto, and the consultations with Major General Doihara, etc., are the army's attitude to independently express its China policy. Major General Doihara's visit to Shanghai is his preparatory work. Therefore, the schedule of Doihara's visit to Shanghai and other matters have not been reported in detail by the local military attaché's office.</p>

<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, most industries in this port were not prosperous last year, resulting in the bankruptcy of nearly a thousand companies. However, in the banking industry, although several small banks also experienced liquidation storms, most of them achieved considerable profits. In the depression of all industries, the banking industry alone is better, which is a畸形phenomenon. As for the detailed figures of the profits of official and commercial banks last year, they have been seen in various newspapers. The business performance of the five major British banks that hold power in China last year is explored below. According to the investigation, there are five British banks in China: Standard Chartered, Mercantile, HSBC, Oriental, and Chartered, all of which have very strong capital and are also very powerful in the financial industry. In 1934, the total net profit of the five banks was 8,821,000 pounds, equivalent to more than 120 million yuan in national currency, an increase of 442,000 pounds compared with 8,379,000 pounds the previous year, an increase of about 5% or more. It is said that most of the income of the banks is from buying and selling customs duties and securities transactions, and the profits from lending and discounting are very small, which is due to the low interest rates last year.</p>

<p>Regarding the Chairman of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, Zhang Weiru, and the standing directors of the exchange, Yin Yunsheng and Shen Changgeng, due to their joint handling of the exchange's business in a manner that allegedly failed to gain the trust of shareholder Kuang Yefu from Guangdong, Kuang sent a letter of inquiry. Zhang and the others responded by stating that Kuang was a new shareholder and had no right to inquire about past matters, rejecting his inquiry. However, Kuang not only refused to relinquish his shareholder rights or remain silent but took further action, collecting evidence and filing a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against Zhang, Yin, and Shen, requesting that the defendants be punished for collusion for personal gain, breach of trust, and embezzlement. The major</p>
<p>allegations of malfeasance</p>
<p>include five items: (1) Allegedly using the guise of the chairman's entertainment expenses to embezzle 36,000 yuan. The explanation states that in the nineteenth year, in addition to the monthly entertainment expenses of 500 yuan, the chairman allegedly deceived a small number of directors into resolving to add a huge sum of 36,000 yuan to the operating expenses as entertainment expenses. Since the entertainment expenses already had a fixed amount, how could additional expenses be added? The defendants had no choice but to create a guise to make up for the waste and deficits, which was actually a disguised form of embezzlement, without any doubt. (2) Embezzling 10,000 yuan donated for the construction of the Central Party Headquarters. In the twentieth year, 10,000 yuan was paid from the operating expenses as a donation for the</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters</p>
<p>construction fee. In reality, the Central Party Headquarters did not receive this sum, and it was embezzled and divided among the defendants without any concealment. (3) Pledging the exchange's inventory of valuable securities for a mortgage of 120,000 yuan and privately misappropriating it. In July of the twentieth year, Zhang Weiru stole the receipt for the 250,000 yuan of post-reorganization treasury bonds held by the exchange in the custody of the Bank of Communications and used it to obtain a mortgage of 120,000 yuan from the Yichang Qianzhuang for private use. After the September 18th Incident, he tried to fabricate expenses and redeem it. (4) Embezzling 170,000 yuan in checks from the Four Ming Bank. In the second half of the twentieth year, the defendants took away from the exchange</p>
<p>Four Ming Bank</p>
<p>two checks, one for 120,000 yuan and one for 50,000 yuan, and their purpose was never clarified. It must have been jointly divided among the three, otherwise, there would be no reason for such a large sum to be ignored by each other. (5) Falsely claiming to have paid 170,000 yuan for the construction of the new exchange site. Earlier this year, the construction of the current new building was contracted through bidding by the Chen Yongxing Construction Company, and the payments made successively all had official receipts from the construction company. However, the 170,000 yuan paid in September of the twentieth year did not obtain an official receipt from the construction company at the time, colluding to embezzle, with clear signs. In summary, the above five items total an embezzlement of 500,600 yuan. This is only what the plaintiff knows;</p>
<p>how much more</p>
<p>is unknown is still uncertain. Therefore, the plaintiff requests that the defendants be arrested and severely punished, and also requests a civil lawsuit, asking the court to order the defendants to jointly return the embezzled 500,600 yuan in full to protect shareholder rights, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the First Special Court opened a court session for interrogation. Defendant Zhang Weiru claimed to be on official business in Beijing, and only Yin Yunsheng and Shen Changgeng appeared in court. Judge Jiang immediately questioned the plaintiff, Kuang Yefu, about the intention of the lawsuit. According to his statement, he has five shares in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, which were purchased in December of last year. Because he has discovered that the defendants have engaged in</p>
<p>collusion for illicit purposes</p>
<p>and collusive malfeasance, for the benefit of the entire company, he is filing a complaint. At this point, the defendants' lawyers, Wu Linkun, Wang Fuchang, Qin Liankui, Zhang Shizhao, and Chen Ying, raised the issue of the right to sue, requesting that the plaintiff's self-accusation be rejected. Judge Jiang also felt that whether the self-accusation could be filed in this case was indeed a question of procedure. Therefore, he decided to temporarily postpone the discussion of the facts of the case and ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin debating on the procedural point first in order to decide. Thus, the plaintiff's lawyer, Wang Jian, first stated the</p>
<p>reasons for the self-accusation,</p>
<p>then cited the legal basis, and finally cited the clauses of the agreement established by the recovery of the concession's legal rights and the establishment of the Chinese court, saying that in this case, the defendants did not need to follow the example of ordinary reporting of criminal offenders and could file a self-accusation according to the fifth clause of the agreement, etc. Subsequently, the lawyers defending the three defendants successively refuted, saying that although the plaintiff's self-accusation was based on the agreement, it should still be bound by the Criminal Procedure Law and that only</p>
<p>those who are directly harmed</p>
<p>can file a self-accusation. Now, the content of the plaintiff's complaint is all about the events of the nineteenth and twentieth years, and his shares were only purchased in December of the twenty-third year, so he is not directly harmed. Moreover, he only has five shares, which is not enough to qualify as a shareholder representative. The old company has long been dissolved, and the current new company only started in April of last year and was registered by the ministry. Even if the plaintiff wants to claim rights, he can only trace back to the date of registration. If he insists on inheriting his dividends, he should first file a lawsuit in the civil court to confirm his shareholder rights. Now he is directly filing a criminal lawsuit, which is illegal and should be rejected, etc. The court then announced that the debate on the procedural part was concluded and would be sentenced on the afternoon of the 19th.</p>

<p>Li Heshang, a local from Liujiazhai, Yangjing, Pudong, 27 years old this year, and his mistress, Li Yushi, a Suzhou woman (25 years old this year), were both housekeepers and amahs for Westerners at No. 247, Lane 261, Baisai Zhong Road in the French Concession. Li had a friend from the same village named Jin Kui, who was scheduled to get married in the near future. Because he lacked funds to make clothes, he discussed with Li and asked Li for help. At around 4:00 PM on the 9th of last month, Jin Kui held a hemp rope and Li held a pistol. They went to the Dahua Coal Ball Distribution Office at No. 3 Shanzhong Road to rob and obtained 12 jiao in small foreign currency before fleeing. Li rode away on a bicycle, heading west on Haige Road. At that time, the victim Xu Guochang followed behind. Li fled to the intersection of Fukaishan Road, where Xu reported to the Vietnamese police at No. 192, who caught up and pursued him. At the intersection of Baisai Zhong Road, the Vietnamese police at No. 434 also helped to pursue him. Li opened fire to resist arrest, killing the Vietnamese police officer at No. 192. At the same time, Li's right leg was also injured by the police's gunfire. He fled back to his employer's house, changed his clothes, lay on the bed, and handed the pistol to his mistress, Li Yushi, and his companion, Sun Linwen (28 years old) from Changshu, to hide. At that time, Li's employer, a Westerner, returned home. Li lied that he was injured by stray bullets in the encounter between the police and the robbers on the road and asked the owner to send him to the hospital for treatment. The Westerner reported the information to the police, who sent detective Zhou Buguang to investigate and solved the case, seizing the pistol and the coat worn by Li (with bullet holes) and the bicycle.

It is reported that Mr. Lu Liankui sent more than 500 yuan to the Jincheng Bank yesterday, which was a special donation, all of which was the price of flower baskets and souvenirs given to his daughters, Misses Gui Fen and Gui Fang, which was transferred to charity. Mr. Lu's move was particularly enthusiastic and commendable. The joint office specially announced and thanked him on the stage last night. The original text is as follows: This time, our association, in order to raise funds and provide relief to the victims of the Jiangzhe disaster, specially invited Dr. Mei Wan Hua and the famous amateur performers on the sea to perform academic opera.

<h3 id="e135">Citizens Should Pay Attention to Preventing Rabies <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The report from the Public Health Department of the Public Works Bureau states that the general public pays little attention to the prevention of rabies, which is a matter of great concern. Although heavy doses were used for those who were injected last year, the effect was not satisfactory. Those seeking treatment often disappeared before completing the injection process. These people are mostly laborers, and although they are told the importance of completing the injections, they are difficult to persuade.</p>
<p>The number of rabid dogs found last year has increased significantly. The general public rarely complies with the practice of putting muzzles on dogs, and taking dogs to the countryside risks infection. If this habit is not changed, rabies cannot be prevented. Even cats can be infected with this disease, and the danger is even greater at that time.</p>
<p>Even if the injection is completed after a person is poisoned, it cannot be determined that the disease will not develop. Currently, there is no other way to save lives except for injections. Therefore, the most important thing is prevention, to prevent infection.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even the educated class does not know how easily dogs can be infected with this disease. Even when a dog is infected, its owner often denies it absolutely, because if their beloved dog is proven to be rabid, the owner's reputation and status will be lost.</p>
<p>Last year, the Health Department purchased injection raw materials from the Pasteur Institute in Paris because of their stronger potency. Now, it has reprinted a pamphlet on rabies to awaken the public's attention. The Health Department believes that the three municipal districts should jointly formulate measures to capture and eliminate all dogs without muzzles. For the sake of society, it is better to eliminate cats and dogs than to play with human lives. Therefore, sentimentality should be abandoned and reason should be followed.</p>

<p>The Hongqiao Sanatorium in western Shanghai, founded by Dr. Ding Fubao, a respected elder in the medical community, was completed last summer. It is beautifully decorated and well-equipped, with various electrotherapy machines, X-ray machines, cold air equipment, anesthesia rooms, delivery rooms, sterilization rooms, chemical laboratory, dining rooms, etc. All types of wards face south and have mutually isolated balconies for patients to rest. With ample sunlight and fresh air, it is one of the most modern sanatoriums in the country.

<h3 id="e137">Xu Zuoxun and Others Propose to Reduce Ferry Fares <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Due to Rural Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Xu Zuoxun, Xin Shenzhai, Gao Jiyun, Hua Xiqing, and others, for the sake of alleviating the burden on the poor laborers in Pudong, suggested to the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association to reduce the price of city ferry tickets and add third and fourth class cabins, etc. The association had submitted a request to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, which approved that the matter was to be handled by the Xingye Trust Company, so it could not be done. Xu and others believe that the collapse of the rural areas and the decline of industry are at an extreme point. Witnessing the situation, they feel compassion. They found that the city-run cross-river ferry reduced fares in the morning and evening to facilitate poor laborers. Long-distance ferries are the same. Although it is not possible to reduce the price of city ferry tickets or add third and fourth class cabins, at a minimum, it is appropriate to add special morning and evening shifts for the poor. The time should follow the example of the cross-river ferry, from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM every day, and from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM in the afternoon. The fare for round trip should be 50% of the current second-class fare, and baggage tickets should be waived to show consideration and benefit the poor. A special written opinion has been prepared and submitted to your association for discussion at the fourth general membership meeting. Special contact has been made with the Xingye Trust Company to achieve the goal. Anxious for a response. It is reported that the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association has included it in the agenda and will discuss it at today's general meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e146">National Invention of Gold Paint <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Hui merchants Mr. Wu Jun Huangxiang and Mr. Cheng Jun Enguang, in view of the fact that the gold paint and decals used in Chinese porcelain, which is known for its pure national goods, must be imported from abroad, fortunately, Yifeng Porcelain Factory has already invented and launched decals. There is still the most difficult to handle gold paint, which has long been a product monopolized by foreigners. Many Chinese have studied this, but because it is so difficult to start, they have successively given up. Mr. Cheng is a chemist with both academic knowledge and experience. In his early years, Mr. Zhang Jian sent him to study chemistry with Dr. Luo Dexiong, a German doctor of chemistry, for more than ten years. In recent years, he served as a technician in the chemical department of Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant. Many of the improvements in the factory's manufacturing matters relied on him. Later, in order to seek further education, he went to the United States to study various chemical industries. After returning to China, he responded to Mr. Wu's invitation and jointly founded the Star Chemical Industry Company at No. 14 Ji Gui Li, Xiejiao Jumen Road, Nanshi, Shanghai, spending huge sums of money and spending a long time to actively research and create gold paint. It has now been announced that it has been completed and has begun to be released. The trademark is named Golden Dragon. The beauty of the results is surprising and can indeed surpass imported products. Chinese manufacturers who want to make their products truly pure national goods can contact Mr. Wu, the manager of the company. Even more commendable is that Mr. Cheng has further served the society with his tireless spirit, and has established the Enguang Chemical Research Branch to accept entrusted chemical testing and design matters from the national goods community.</p>

<h3 id="e148">The Pawnbroking Industry in This City Held a Spring Conference Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that the Shanghai Pawnbroking Industry Association held a spring conference at 2:00 PM yesterday at the pawnbroking office in Wu Jia Nong, Hou Jia Qiao, Nanshi. More than 40 members of the industry attended, including Ji Hong Chuan Zuo Heng, Ding He Du Yunchu, Tong Yi Wu Qiutao, Shun Kang Hu Chunsheng, Yu Tai Fang Minfu, Qian Yi Qu Qiufang, De He Shen Boxin, Yi Chang Huang Yuanren, Guang Da Zhang Shengyao, Bao Kang Weng Zhitian, and Tong Yi Xing Mengqun. The chairman was Chuan Zuoheng and the recorder was Yu Langxi. The discussions included: (1) The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a survey form on the prosperity and decline of business, ordering the industry to fill it out. It was decided to reprint the form and distribute it to the industry, two copies per pawnshop, to fill it out truthfully and submit it to the association for compilation. (2) The association's office was previously decided to be renovated at a general meeting. However, due to the economic downturn, the industry is afraid that it will be difficult to bear the construction cost. Therefore, the main resolution was to decide that since the office would not be renovated, the office should consider the situation and find ways to repair it. (3) Omitted. (4) Mr. Hu Chunsheng's letter stated that the pawn industry was prosperous last year, and the profits came from the pawn industry filling up with goods. Starting this year, the industry should unite as one, unify interest rates, and refuse to pawn strange costumes. The government should also stipulate the clothing system for men and women, and use domestically produced cloth and silk fabrics as the only raw materials in order to save the industry. It was decided that the industry should pay special attention to the spring inventory this year and not reduce prices too much to avoid losses. (5) Omitted. (6) In the French Concession, some members of the industry intend to shorten the maturity period to twelve months. How should this be handled? Please make a public decision. It was decided that the members of the industry in the French Concession should convene a meeting to decide on their own. According to Mr. Chuan Zuoheng, chairman of the association, to the Datong News Agency reporter, the pawnbroking industry's business situation last year was that 95% of the companies lost money. The reason for the loss was the impact of the severe drop in prices. The past two years have been the most severe period of price decline. The maturity period of the pawn industry was originally 18 months, and the clothes that were pledged two years ago also matured last year. Therefore, the heavy losses were inevitable. As for the old companies that closed their pawnshops last year, there were Taichang, Anding, Nanda, Yuansheng, and others. As for the concession, it belongs to the new companies, and the situation is not very clear. It is speculated that there are not a few companies that have stopped operating.</p>

<p>After the 6th of this month, the Yangtze River water level suddenly decreased, and between Hankou and Jiujiang, it was only 11 feet and 2 inches. Large ships were all suspended, and all Yangtze River ships were restricted in loading. In the past three days, the water level of the Yangtze River has increased rapidly due to the rising water level of the Xiang River, rising by more than 2 feet per day. The new record of the Yangtze River rising water level is seven feet and several inches in three days. Yesterday, Hankou reported that the water level between Jiujiang and Hankou has risen to 15 feet and 5 inches, and the water level between Wuhu and Jiujiang has risen to 18 feet. The restriction on loading at Jianghanguan has been lifted, and the ships grounded on the Xiaogushan side of the Yangtze River have been rescued due to the rising water level. The shipping companies in this city have agreed that from today onwards, the restrictions on the loading of cargo on Yangtze River ships have been lifted, and upstream and downstream shipping has been completely opened.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association Concerned About the People's Food in Their Hometown <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Discussing Purchasing 50,000 Stones of Saigon Rice</p>
<p>Expediting Spring Relief and Agricultural Relief in Ningbo</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association, sighed that the drought disaster in the counties of Ningbo last year was extremely serious. The Civil Affairs Department investigated the disaster situation and did not include the counties in the emergency winter relief. In fact, at the end of winter and the beginning of spring, farmers have no food to last overnight. Therefore, they are extremely concerned about the people's food in their hometown. A meeting of the committee was convened to discuss jointly raising funds to purchase 50,000 stones of Saigon rice to expedite spring relief and agricultural relief to relieve the suffering. It is reported that the association has sent a special letter to the Quan Zhe Relief Association to obtain a tax-free passport to facilitate the process. The letter states: "I am writing to inform you that the drought ravaged the land last year, and the severity of the disaster was unprecedented. The disaster situation in the old Ningbo prefectures, such as Yin, Ci, Zhen, Feng, Ding, and Xiang counties, is no different from that of the counties in western Zhejiang. However, the Civil Affairs Department's investigation of the disaster situation did not include the counties in the emergency winter relief. Perhaps it is because the silkworm industry in western Zhejiang has been in poor harvest for many years and the price of silk has plummeted, coupled with the drought disaster, which is even more painful in comparison, resulting in the exclusion of Ningbo. It is not known that Ningbo is not a rice-producing area, and even in a year of good harvest, it is not enough to be self-sufficient. In addition, the people lack food in the event of a major disaster. At the end of winter and the beginning of spring, farmers have no food to last overnight. In the blink of an eye, they will be engaged in morning farming. The situation is unimaginable at a time when the new and old crops are not connected. Our colleagues in the association have repeatedly met and discussed and plan to purchase 50,000 stones of Saigon rice to expedite spring relief and agricultural relief to relieve the suffering. In addition to the county governments and relief sub-associations doing their best to raise funds, the shortfall will be raised by our association from the fellow villagers in Shanghai. Therefore, we are writing to ask your association to transfer the request to the Relief Committee to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance to issue a tax-free passport for 50,000 stones to facilitate relief. We are anxiously awaiting your reply."</p>
<h3 id="e151">Workers at Tianzhang Paper Mill Strike <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Due to Unequal Treatment Between the East and West Factories by the Employer</p>
<p>And the Dismissal of More Than Ten Members of the Labor Union</p>
<p>The Tianzhang Paper East Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, employs more than 100 workers. Last year, the workers repeatedly requested the Party and government authorities through the Fifth District Paper Workers Union to mediate because the factory could not provide the same treatment as the West Factory of the company, paying bonuses for annual paper. It has been nearly a year and has not been resolved. Recently, it has been learned that at the end of this year, the staff and tea servants of the East Factory have received bonuses, while the workers who have worked hard day and night have received nothing, which has caused deep resentment between labor and capital. On the 10th of this month, the workers expressed dissatisfaction with the factory's delay in paying wages for six days, which caused a slowdown strike. The labor union persuaded the workers to retreat, and Li, the captain of the third squadron of the local police, took on the role of mediation. Both parties unconditionally resumed work. Unexpectedly, after the incident, the factory suddenly dismissed eleven people, including Jin Changfa, the director of the labor union, and Chen Lizhi, a member, on the pretext that the workers went on strike. More than 20 police officers were deployed inside and outside the factory, as if facing a great enemy. The labor union sent personnel to negotiate, but to no avail. As a result, all the workers went on strike together. After the Fifth District Paper Workers Union reported the incident, in addition to sending personnel to comfort the workers and maintain order, it has reported to the Party and government authorities and the General Labor Union for verification.</p>

<p>According to the report by the Chief of Works of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in January, among the public works projects, two new school buildings, namely the Hanbury Girls' School and the Chinese Girls' Elementary School, were completed and handed over for use. The interior decoration of the new Fuzhou Road Central Police Station building is still in progress, and drainage pipes have been installed in the courtyard. The East Hongkou Vegetable Market is half completed. The framework of the new bridge on Dinghai Road has been installed, but the project has been slightly delayed due to the severe cold.</p>

A total of 7,198 tons of garbage and sweepings were sent to the two incinerators for incineration.</p>
<p>Condition of Milk Supply in the Shanghai International Settlement</p>
<p>The supply of fresh milk and cheese in the Shanghai International Settlement comes from 2,162 yellow cattle, 206 water buffalo, and 118 goats. There are 28 dairy farms, 10 of which have "Grade A" licenses and 17 of which have "Grade B" licenses. The average daily milk production in the morning is 30,380 pounds, an increase of 17% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The cattle at each farm are regularly inspected by the Municipal Council's veterinarians. The cattle at Grade B farms are examined individually every six months, and the cattle at Grade A farms are examined individually every three months, with temporary inspections in addition. The fresh meat in the Public Settlement comes from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Anhui provinces. The slaughtering places include the Municipal Council's large slaughterhouse, the Municipal Council's pig slaughterhouse, and four private pig slaughterhouses. Nowadays, the slaughtering of cattle, sheep, and pigs all adopts new humane methods, with excellent results. Butchers and meat vendors initially strongly opposed the new methods, but their opposition has gradually subsided.</p>
<p>Extension of Publication Date for "Scenic Views of Southeast China"</p>
<p>The publicity team of the "Traffic Tour of the Five Southeast Provinces" has prepared a book called "Scenic Views of Southeast China," which was originally scheduled to be published on the 15th of this month. However, the printing of the book is extremely time-consuming, and all the text has been carefully collected, resulting in a work that is rich in both text and illustrations. The printer dares not produce it carelessly and strives to ensure that the book is treasured by all sectors of society. Therefore, the publication date of the 15th of this month could not be realized. It is now reported that the publication has been extended to March 15th and will definitely be published then. At the same time, the period for advance orders will be extended to the end of this month so that those who have not yet pre-ordered can enjoy the special pre-order price (the regular price is eight yuan per copy, but the pre-order price is only four yuan). The pre-order locations are United Advertising Company at 255 Shandong Road, Shanghai, the headquarters of China Travel Service on Sichuan Road, Life Bookstore on Fuzhou Road, Section 6 of the Department of Construction of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou, and the branches of China Travel Service in Guangzhou and Nanjing.</p>
<p>Spring Lantern Festival at the Shanghai National Products Company</p>
<p>A Poem Presented by Taoist Songshi</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hong Temple on Nanjing Road, held a Spring Lantern Festival a few days ago. It collected hundreds of types of lanterns made by famous craftsmen, including airplane lanterns and anti-Japanese revolving lanterns, and gave them away to customers. The supply could not meet the demand. These timely gifts were very popular among those who love to buy national products. Yesterday, a customer who signed himself as Taoist Songshi presented a poem, which, amidst elegance, also conveyed a deep sense of patriotism. The poem reads, "Spring days cannot be kept, lantern light accompanies night tours. Everyone promotes national products, the small streams will converge into a great flow." The poem cleverly uses the four characters of "Spring Lantern Festival" as the first character of each line, forming a coherent whole. It is specially recorded here for the enjoyment of all.</p>

<p>3 PM at Shenyuan Football Field</p>
<p>Yesterday, French Business Beat Chinese Police 9-0</p>
<p>In yesterday's Scota Cup semi-final, French Business defeated Chinese Police 9-0, securing a spot in the final. The other semi-final, between Donghua and Rucks, is scheduled for 3 PM today at Shenyuan, to determine who will face French Business in the final. Both Donghua and Rucks have plenty of talent and strength. Donghua is undefeated in the First Division League. While Rucks may not be as strong as Donghua, it is the strongest of the Western teams and a formidable opponent for Donghua. Their encounter is sure to be intensely competitive. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>In yesterday's Scota Cup semi-final match between French Business and Chinese Police, held in Yiwei, French Business eliminated Chinese Police 9-0 to secure a spot in the final, where they will face the winner of today's Donghua-Rucks match.</p>
<p>Strength Ultimately Inferior</p>
<p>After eliminating Western Business with a 1-0 victory, the Chinese Police surprised everyone. In Beijing during the New Year, they defeated Jinghua 4-1. However, their strength was ultimately much inferior to that of French Business, and there was nothing they could do about it. However, given time, they may become something special.</p>
<p>Five International Players</p>
<p>French Business added one international player to their forward line yesterday, namely Kelasha. As a result, their strength increased significantly, and their attack was particularly fierce. If they face Donghua in the final, it will be a spectacle to behold. Yesterday, French Business had a total of five international players: Kelasha, Fafanxiao, Lemidi, Mashan'er, and Huate. It is no wonder that Chinese Police were defeated.</p>
<p>Stalemate Lasted Twenty Minutes</p>
<p>The two sides were evenly matched for twenty minutes. Chinese Police were in high spirits and had good leg strength. They ran around tirelessly and even managed to attack the French Business goal. For a time, French Business seemed helpless. Chinese Police kicked off, and French Business's Qinsheng dribbled straight in. Miao Huaguo cleared the ball. Wu Xiquan attacked along the wing several times, but with little success due to his lack of strength. French Business gradually gained the upper hand, but Chinese Police built a strong defense, and French Business could not cross the line. They held out until the twentieth minute when Baoxiu Tuo angled a shot, breaking the Chinese Police's iron gate.</p>
<p>First Half Four to Zero</p>
<p>After Baoxiu Tuo's goal, the situation changed completely. After Dong Zhaobin's free kick from outside the penalty line failed, Lemidi flew in and Baoxiu Tuo headed in another goal. Yin Xingsheng picked it up and lost it again. Xiao Dong pushed it in lightly, making it three to zero. Fafanxiao also scored. At halftime, French Business led 4-0.</p>
<p>Second Half Five to Zero</p>
<p>As a result, the Chinese Police completely collapsed. In the first minute of the second half, Kelasha launched an attack. The ball bounced off the goal and did not go in. Fafanxiao was tripped, and Lemidi scored a penalty, making it 5-0. The French Police were now at the mercy of French Business, and many mistakes were made. Fafanxiao made a great effort to score the sixth goal, Kelasha the seventh, Qinsheng the eighth, and Fafanxiao scored the final ninth goal. The Chinese Police failed to score, and their lack of strength was a matter of fate.</p>

<p>Two Rivers and Chongde Withdraw from Division A</p>
<p>Only Jinan and Southeast Compete for Victory</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association's women's Division A and B games will begin tonight at Shenyuan, promising a new atmosphere. However, Two Rivers and Chongde have withdrawn for various reasons, leaving only Jinan and Southeast to compete in Division A. The format will be best-of-three. In addition to two women's games tonight, there will also be two makeup games: Zhenru vs. Eagles and Liangxi vs. Moore. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Huadong vs. Southeast Women's B 6:30 PM Lu Xiangqian</p>
<p>Southeast vs. Jinan Women's A 7:20 PM Zhang Yuansheng</p>
<p>Zhenru vs. Eagles Division A 8:10 PM Shao Leping</p>
<p>Liangxi vs. Moore Division B 9:10 PM Wang Yiqiao</p>
<p>(Note) Guanghua Women's Team has withdrawn, and all games against that team have been cancelled.</p>
<p>Only two games were played at the Shanghai Basketball Association last night. In Division B, Yaoguang defeated Moore 21-14. Although there were no championship implications in the Division A/B match between Datong and Qingguang, there was still a difference in rankings, so the competition was fierce. Throughout the game, Datong led, and Qingguang closely followed. However, although Tan Dong and others showed glimpses of their former glory, they clearly lacked the strength of their younger days, leaving them feeling unwilling. As a result, Datong defeated Qingguang 37-20.</p>

<h3 id="e156">You You Achieves Victory on Both Fronts: A Team Defeats Saguer 6-1, B Team Wins Over Donghua 3-0 <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>You You's A and B football teams played yesterday. The A team competed against Saguer in the A Group match at Shen Garden, while the B team played against Donghua B in the third replay of the Zilin Cup at Hongkou Park. As a result, one team won by a large margin of 6-1, and the other team won 3-0. Everyone was delighted with the double victory. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Team Defeats Saguer</p>
<p>You You A team has been conserving energy for a long time, and everyone is energetic and strong. They played against Saguer in the A Group match at Shen Garden, controlling the overall situation. Saguer had no choice. As a result, You You won a big victory of 6-1. The results of each team in Group A are as follows:</p>
<p>Scoring a Hat-Trick</p>
<p>The competition was quite remarkable. You You's offensive was extremely strong, but Saguer also showed no weakness, holding on for a long time. Zhou Shaowen first probed the goal and succeeded in one fell swoop. Saguer launched several attacks, but none were successful. After that, Sun Jinshun scored another goal, and Luo Haiguang, full of ambition, also made a contribution. In the first half, You You won with a score of 3-0, and Saguer was at a loss.</p>
<p>Creating a Half Dozen</p>
<p>After the break, Saguer tried to recover lost ground, and the situation became more tense. You You took advantage of the remaining power and did not give way. The forwards were able to connect well, and Sun Tuitui scored again, taking a remote lead of 4-0. Saguer actively counterattacked and finally broke the duck egg by Nostendoff, while Luo Haiguang and Zhong Yongshen scored again, resulting in a final score of 6-1. The formations of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>B Team Overcomes Donghua</p>
<p>The Donghua and You You B teams in the Western Union Football Association's Zilin Cup were evenly matched. Once they met, it could be said that they had met their match. Therefore, after two fierce battles, the victory was undecided. They held the third replay at the first Hongkou Stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday. Because most of Donghua's veterans were undertaking the youth team's expedition to Hangzhou, their strength was greatly reduced. As a result of the battle, they were defeated 3-0.</p>
<p>The Silver Whistle Sounds</p>
<p>Donghua kicked off first, only to see the five forwards advancing in a single line, assisting each other, traversing the enemy's line, but there was no chance, and they were in vain. After about a quarter of an hour, You You's Xu Wenkui sent troops to attack, breaking through the gates and slashing generals, and the momentum was surging. After a few passes, the ball had reached the front of the goal, and Wenkui shot hard at the goal, the ball went in from the lower left corner. You You won a goal, and their morale was even greater. Almost the entire Donghua goal was the world of You You, while Donghua could not cross the Lei Chi line.</p>
<p>Changing Sides and Fighting Again</p>
<p>They came to China bravely, hoping for the final victory, charging into battle, unstoppable. However, the forwards did not connect, and the shooting was inaccurate, so they could not get what they wanted. Once, Donghua's inner guard, Chen Gongyu, illegally bumped into someone in the penalty area and was penalized a penalty kick. Xu Wenkui took the shot, quickly and accurately, and the goalkeeper stared at it, sighing at the ball. You You continued to spy, and never slackened. Xi Qiaosheng was extremely brave and intercepted Shi Jinsheng's ball. He passed the ball from 20 yards away, making it 3-0. After that, they went back and forth with each other, and there was very little danger. When the long whistle sounded, a difficult ball game was solved.</p>

<p>Due to the severe drought and flood disasters in various places last year, the Hubei Provincial Party Department launched a winter relief fund, divided into ball games and recreational activities, using the income from tickets to donate to the disaster relief bureau after deducting the necessary expenses. In terms of provincial ball games, in addition to inviting local well-known teams to participate, in order to increase interest and attract the audience, they first contacted Shen Siliang and Zhou Jiaqi of the Sports Promotion Association and the Youth Football Team. At the same time, Ke Nanshan, the director of the Provincial Public Sports Field, was sent to Shanghai to investigate. The Youth Football Team had once defeated Innes and recently won all the matches in Hangzhou.

<p>There will be about four games in Hubei, scheduled for March 1, 2, 5, and 8, at the Wuhan Public Sports Field, the original site of the Third National Games, or the Wuhan Stadium. The participating teams include the Ji Jian Team, which represented Hubei Province at the National Games, and the United Team, which is jointly formed by the Far East and Boxue teams. The British Navy, Kepler, and Western Merchants are all excellent in Wuhan. At that time, they will surely attract the attention of the elite in central Hubei and open an unprecedented grand occasion in Wuhan ball games. Ke Nanshan has negotiated everything satisfactorily and decided to return to Hubei tonight to arrange everything in advance.</p>

<p>Approving the Principle of the Declaration and Proposing Basic Work</p>
<p>The First Step of Enlightenment Should Start with Education</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech at the China Arts and Crafts Society at 2:30 PM yesterday, attended by more than 500 teachers and staff from various schools. The topic was "The Enlightenment Movement of Chinese-Based Cultural Construction." In addition to explaining in detail the declaration of Chinese-based cultural construction issued by the Ten Professors, he also contributed to the basic work of cultural construction. The speech was very long, and the following is an excerpt of the main points: Pan first expressed his approval of the principles of the Ten Declarations, and then said that the basic work to be done to break the current state of ignorance and confusion is to do the first step of work, and then the second step of work can be done. If the first step of enlightenment work is not done, it is impossible to build a culture. Those who are responsible for this enlightenment work are first of all people in the education field. Culture is the moderation of all lifestyles and life forms of human beings. It is all-encompassing and all-purpose. Culture cannot be built by a few people, especially not by one or two people. Of course, it first depends on the foresight and consciousness of the promoters, and then on the propaganda of the afterthought and consciousness, but most people must be able to imitate this way of life before it can be done to build a culture. The so-called culture, "wen" is civilization, and "hua" is change and dissolution. To change and deepen to tend towards civilization is culture. Therefore, culture is civilization. However, "hua" must be universal. If it is not universal, it cannot be considered "hua." Therefore, the first step in building a culture is to enable most people to receive this lifestyle and do it according to this lifestyle, which must rely on the enlightenment movement. The so-called enlightenment, in other words, is the popularization of education movement. Cultural construction must start with education. Without education, it is impossible to talk about cultural construction. The meaning of education is divided into two aspects: one is the guidance of thought, so that spiritual life is happy, and the other is the training of skills, so that material life progresses. The former is literacy education, and the latter is production education. Only when the two can be taken care of without being biased can they be considered complete education. Only by popularizing this kind of education can people be able to receive new lifestyles. Therefore, the foundation of the enlightenment movement for cultural construction is the education field.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3 id="e170">What University Graduates Should Know When Serving in the Banking Industry <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>(2) Tang Shoumin</p>
<p>(2) Serve Loyally: You should work for the organization, not for individuals. You should consider serving the organization as a lifelong career. Be loyal and persevere. Avoid restlessness, indecision, or changing your mind frequently. The purpose of this bank hiring you is to cultivate sound banking talent. If, after being trained, you immediately move to other fields, it will discourage various organizations, businesses, and merchants in society from wanting to employ university graduates. I hope you will not have such thoughts. If you unfortunately harbor such ideas, you should realize this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Responsibility: You all come from universities or specialized colleges, and you certainly understand the importance of responsibility. This means not shirking responsibility beforehand and not evading it afterward. Do what you say, and speak after you have done it. All assigned tasks should be handled responsibly and completed quickly within the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(4) Cooperation: Since you have resolved to serve here, you must not only be responsible and patient but also possess a spirit of cooperation. Especially in larger organizations, you should maximize this spirit. For example, if there are errors in the work of the lending department, the accounting department should be attentive and carefully check the calculations. When errors are found, everyone should work together, without being divisive, to avoid losses to the entire organization.</p>
<p>(5) Treat People with Humility and Sincerity: Commercial firms sell goods, while financial institutions do not sell silver dollars or banknotes. What they sell is "service." You should treat customers with diligence and courtesy. Ordinary people generally feel that bank employees consider themselves to be of a high status, arrogant and conceited. Especially towards some of the older, larger banks, many people are afraid to even enter. Although they have savings, they are afraid to deposit them. This bad habit greatly affects the banks. Please pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>(6) Diligent and Careful Service: Modern banks should pay the most attention to providing thorough service to customers, especially "counter service." This bank has a similar position to major banks. As long as our service is good, not arrogant, and not deceptive, we can surpass others. Speak truthfully, and treat people sincerely. When I was the Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Bank, I promoted an idea to supervise the employees, which was that "the Deputy Manager should also sit at the counter." As a result, everyone provided particularly diligent service and had no arrogance. At that time, we were very popular with customers and praised by society. It is best for the cashier to chat with customers while paying, to dispel their boredom and create a good impression. If you treat people with arrogance, no matter how much you advertise, it will be useless.</p>
<p>(7) Engage in Research: Service should not come at the expense of reading. In your spare time, read books on banking to supplement your knowledge, increase your experience, and develop your abilities. For all unfamiliar banking practices, you should engage in research and ask experienced individuals for guidance. Be humble and avoid being too subjective or overly complacent. Publish your research findings in communications from time to time.</p>
<p>(8) Resist Assimilation: Everyone has their own thoughts and strengths. If you can contribute these strengths as much as possible, the organization will surely thrive. I welcome your good suggestions, and I will adopt them within the possible scope. The worst thing is not having good suggestions yourself while being suspicious and slandering the suggestions of others. As a result, no one speaks up, no one wants to seek progress and development for the entire organization, and everyone becomes corrupt and lifeless. If there are people with these habits, you should assimilate them, not be assimilated by them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the salary issue for employees in this bank. In society, many organizations and businesses, except for the post office and customs, do not treat their employees as well as banks. If you can fully demonstrate your abilities, you can increase your salary at any time. In the past, it was customary for branch managers and deputy managers to request salary increases for their colleagues at the end of each year. This was done for both diligent and capable employees and for those who were lazy and incompetent. For example, if a branch had 30 employees, more than 20 could be promoted, and the remaining few would also be promoted out of consideration for their feelings. As a result, performance evaluations were essentially meaningless, increasing expenses each year and reducing the efficiency of hard-working employees. This is regrettable. Therefore, last year, I re-evaluated the salaries of all employees, both low and high. From now on, if a supervisor says that an employee is performing well, that employee can be given a salary increase at any time. "Increases every day, increases every moment," depend entirely on your abilities and hard work as the standard for promotion and the method for increasing salaries. As for bonuses, in the past, they were distributed according to salary regardless of performance. This method essentially defeats the purpose of rewards. In the future, we will implement rewards based on merit. Those with excellent service can receive more, while those with poor evaluations, those with faults, or those with excessive leave may not receive any at all.</p>
<p>Another point you should understand is that when the organization establishes new branches or transfers personnel, you must comply with the transfers, regardless of the distance. After being transferred to various places, you will have the opportunity to understand the financial and economic conditions of different regions, which will help you become national financial talents. This is what I very much hope for.</p>
<p>Finally, you all have different areas of expertise, such as accounting, economics, agriculture, textiles, etc. Those who specialize in accounting have been assigned to the Audit Department. In the near future, we will add a training class for accountants. The goal is to ensure that you fully understand everything "from vouchers to final accounts." After training, you will be assigned to various branches to work as accountants, while the original accounting staff will be transferred back to the head office to work in auditing. Those assigned to the business department will also use a practical training method, where the original operators will stand beside you and provide guidance. After you become proficient, the original staff will be transferred. The overall goal is to improve the abilities of all employees, so that they can be applied everywhere. Those with a background in textile schools can be sent to various textile factories for practical training. It is hoped that all other specialists will focus on their work. One more thing to remember is to admit and correct your mistakes and not be affected by negative assimilation. Strive forward, so as not to disappoint the original intention of cultivating you all. (End)</p>

<p>When we walk through the streets and alleys, we can see many children with runny noses and wearing tattered clothes, jumping, running, and playing.</p>
<p>When a child carrying a schoolbag walks past excitedly, they will stare with envy, seeming to harbor resentment and sigh deeply.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun or in the freezing cold, many school-age children are selling fried dough sticks, melon seeds, and peanuts, their cries piercing the hearts of people, leaving a bitter feeling.</p>
<p>Are they all born with a miserable fate? Among them, many hope to study and seek knowledge. However, the social environment and the pressures of life do not allow them to develop their potential.</p>
<p>This year is the Year of the Child. It is hoped that people of ambition in the country will quickly find ways to save these poor, unfortunate children. Perhaps the core members who will save the country in the future will be among this group of children!</p>
<h3 id="e172">Clever and Studious Children in Ancient Times <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Dazhai</p>
<p>Pei Xiu of the Jin Dynasty studied diligently and was able to write at the age of eight. A friend praised him, saying, "Pei Xiu will be a leader of outstanding talents." A leader is someone extraordinary. Children, if you aspire to be an extraordinary person and do extraordinary things in the future, you must work hard from a young age, lest you grieve when you are old.</p>
<p>Xu Ling of the Southern and Northern Dynasties loved reading historical records from a young age. Like Pei Xiu, he was able to write at the age of eight. By the age of thirteen, he was familiar with Lao Tzu and Zhuangzi. He read a lot and memorized numerous "classics," so his writing almost always quoted "classics." This style was called Six Dynasties literature. Together with Yu Xin, they were known as the Xu-Yu style, which has been passed down to this day. Now, times are different, and children do not necessarily need to seek "classics" in ancient books. However, how much common sense do you have in your heart? Hurry up and work hard!</p>
<p>Li He of the Tang Dynasty was able to write poetry at the age of seven. At that time, two great writers, Han Yu and Huangfu Shi, did not believe this, thinking, how could a seven-year-old child be a "poet"? They suspected that someone was writing for him and pretending. The two went to Li He's house to see him write poetry in person. Li He took up a pen and immediately composed a poem titled "High Carriage Passes By." Han Yu and Huangfu Shi were greatly surprised and said it was "rare and valuable." Children, do people praise your work when they see it? If not, you must practice diligently, and you will gradually improve. If you don't do this, time will pass easily, and you will easily transform from a child into an adult with still incoherent sentences and numerous typos. Wouldn't you be laughed at? Judge by the small, so don't miss this "golden age."</p>

<p>I love Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Love our country, do not let it be ruined;</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder, and school has let out for a winter break of over twenty days. The northwest wind is howling, blowing in gusts on the bare branches of the trees.</p>
<p>Ping'er had to hide at home to escape the cold. It was quite boring at home, and he was thinking of doing some work. Just then, his older brother, Jian'er, came in from outside and said, "Your teacher from school just came over and told Dad, 'Ping'er isn't very good at natural science.' So Dad asked me to teach you."</p>
<p>Ping'er lowered his head, feeling ashamed. Jian'er said, "There's no need to be ashamed, as long as you work hard. If there's anything you don't understand, just ask me." Ping'er went to the bookshelf to get a natural science book he had read before and asked, "Brother! The teacher said the earth is elliptical, but I'm a bit confused."</p>
<p>"In ancient China, people always said, 'Heaven is round, and the earth is square.' People in ancient Western countries also believed this. But the great Greek philosopher Aristotle said, 'During a lunar eclipse, the earth's shadow is projected onto the moon. Its edge is curved, so we know the earth is round.' The Egyptian astronomer Ptolemy also said, 'Ships entering the port see the bridge first, then the hull. Ships leaving the port see the entire ship first, then gradually disappear.' Furthermore, adventurers like Columbus and Magellan discovered the New World. These are all ironclad proofs that the earth is round.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the British scientist Newton used the method of centrifugal force to speculate that the earth was liquid in the past, and its equator must have expanded due to rotation, while the poles were flattened. That's how we know the earth is a flattened ellipse, not a perfectly round ball." Jian'er excitedly told his younger brother, and Ping'er memorized each sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Snatching the Sheep <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Biguang</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, the winter vacation is over, and we have to concentrate on studying again. But overworking the mind can also harm the body. It is best to play a game after using your brain for a while to balance a body that hasn't exercised for a long time. Snatching the Sheep is the best game.</p>
<p>Snatching the Sheep requires ten children to organize (at least five or six children). Today, let's assume there are ten children. Nine children act as the sheep, arranged in order according to their height. The tallest is the head, and the next tallest holds onto the back of the head sheep's collar with both hands, tightly, without letting go. This is repeated down the line. The person who is snatching the sheep stands in front of the sheep head. The sheep head is like an old sheep, and the eight behind are like lambs. The person who is snatching the sheep comes to snatch the lambs. The old sheep must protect the lambs from being snatched away, while the lambs must closely follow the old sheep to escape.</p>
<p>When the sheep snatcher sees that everyone is ready, they shout the countdown, one, two, three, and start snatching. Within five minutes, see how many sheep they can snatch. The snatched sheep must step aside. At the end, the old sheep and the snatched sheep are punished by lining up and hopping on one foot for ten feet. This is to punish the old sheep for not protecting the sheep well and the lambs for not escaping effectively. It is really interesting!</p>

<h3 id="e178">How Do Humans Spend the Winter? <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>In ancient times, when winter came, humans had no other way to keep warm except to hide in caves, wear animal skins, and burn firewood to warm their bodies. (Image 1) As civilization advanced, the methods of keeping warm became more complete. In modern times, when winter comes, people install coal stoves, electric heaters, and hot water radiators in their houses to warm the air. (Image 2) There are several kinds of clothing materials such as animal skins, wool, cotton, and woolen yarn, all of which can maintain body temperature. (Image 3) The above describes how people living in temperate zones spend the winter. The winter lives of people living in the arctic zones are different: They stack snow bricks into a circular shape, getting smaller and smaller towards the top, and cover the top with a round piece of snow. The gaps between the bricks are filled with loose snow. In this way, they create a windproof house that can be used to survive the winter. Their clothes are made entirely of animal skins. Boots are also made of long-haired skin. (Image 4)</p>
<p>Children, are we always afraid of winter? What ways can we use to keep our bodies always warm? Carry hand warmers and foot warmers? That will make your hands and feet prone to chilblains. Rely on a coal stove? That coal gas is unhygienic. Install an electric heater or hot water radiator? The price is too high and not every family can afford it. Therefore, the best way is to exercise often. Sufficient exercise will make you sweat even in winter.</p>
<p>Exercise often, and don't be afraid of the wind. That's the way to be a child of the new era! (Image 5)</p>
<h3 id="e179">Snow <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Hengjiu Qianchuo</p>
<p>The Formation of Snow: Water vapor encounters cold temperatures in the sky and turns into rain. Before the rain reaches the ground, it encounters even colder temperatures and turns into "snow." Individual pieces of snow are called snow pellets, and clumps of snow are called snowflakes. Both are generally called "snow."</p>
<p>The Properties of Snow: Snow is white and light. Its shapes vary and are very beautiful, including hexagonal and multi-angled shapes. (Image 1) However, sometimes snowflakes merge with each other, or after reaching the ground, they lose their original shape due to the prevailing temperature.</p>
<p>Snow Games: There are many types of snow games, such as building snowmen, throwing snowballs, rolling snowballs, pushing sleds, and playing snowball fights. These are all games that we like. (Image 2)</p>
<p>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Snow: The benefits of snow: 1. Beautifying the scenery; 2. Killing pests and insect eggs, which helps crops. This is why farmers hope it will snow in winter. The disadvantages of snow: 1. Damaging the young buds of plants; 2. Excessive snow can collapse houses and hinder transportation.</p>
<p>Year-Round Snow: Our country is located in the North Temperate Zone, so there is no year-round snow cover. In the Arctic, the Eskimos live in areas with year-round snow cover. Even their houses are made of ice and snow! (Image 3)</p>
<h3 id="e180">Dangerous Coal Gas <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Chaojun</p>
<p>Children! Don't you often read newspapers? Aren't many people poisoned by coal gas every winter? Why do they die? The main reason is that the stoves they use only have two openings, and they close the doors and windows tightly when they sleep. Because burning coal produces carbon gas, this is a very common piece of knowledge. Coal produces carbon gas, which combines with the oxygen in the existing air to form carbon dioxide. However, the amount of oxygen in the room is limited. Combined with the breathing of the sleeping person, the air in the room becomes carbon dioxide. However, the carbon gas continues to be produced, and there is no oxygen to combine with it. It can only convert the carbon dioxide in the room into carbon monoxide. People continue to breathe, inhaling toxic carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is toxic and has coagulation properties. It mixes into the blood and replaces the oxygen, turning into carboxyhemoglobin, and solidifies, preventing circulation, so people die. Although some people say that water can detoxify, it can only add more oxygen to the room, but it cannot detoxify permanently, so this is a misconception. As for the method of rescue, the simplest thing is to open another hole in the stove and use a chimney to lead the carbon gas from the stove to the outside.</p>
<p>Children, you should pay attention to coal poisoning and explain it to your neighbors and classmates so that they all know the horror of coal poisoning and this inaccurate misconception.</p>

<p>— Zhang Nancun</p>
<p>Hai'er saw that Uncle Hu's pug next door was wearing a cotton coat and said, "Uncle Hu loves his pug very much and is afraid it will get cold, so he specially made a cotton coat for it to wear. What I love is my doll. In weather like this, it's still naked. Are people worse off than dogs?" He found some scraps of leather and asked his mother to make a leather coat for the doll to wear, like the decorations of foreign children. His mother said, "Toy dolls have no sensation and don't need to wear leather coats. We have our own body temperature. In winter, we wear leather and cotton clothes to prevent our body heat from dissipating, so we feel warm. But toy dolls have no body temperature. They don't feel cold without clothes, and they don't feel warm with clothes, so there's no need to make them." Hai'er said, "I understand that after this explanation, but it seems that toys should be suitable for the season. Winter requires wearing clothes. Why is the doll especially naked? Then it can only be used as a summer toy, not a winter toy. It would be more interesting to wear a leather coat. Please make it for me." His mother said, "Do you know? Last year's drought was very severe, and many disaster victims in various places were starving and freezing, with no clothes to keep warm. Are you also moved?" Hai'er said, "Then, can I donate all the lucky money and New Year's money that the elders have given me these past few days to help the disaster victims?" The mother greatly praised him and agreed to his request, making the doll's leather coat into clothes to wear. Hai'er looked at the doll wearing the leather coat and sang:</p>
<p>"Doll, wearing a leather coat, wears a leather coat and smiles happily, disaster victims are cold and hungry and crying, I am willing to use some of my money to help you."</p>

<p>The father exchanged a joint giveaway coupon for two bags of chocolate candies. The child was extremely happy and asked his father how many he had exchanged. The father said, "One bag in my hand and one bag in my pocket. How many bags do you see in total?" The child replied, "Three bags." The father angrily scolded, "You stupid person, how many are you and me?" The child replied, "Two stupid people."</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>I now knew how people obtain those precious gemstones from this deep valley. I had heard such stories before, but I couldn't believe them until I saw it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>When eagles have young, people come to this place. They stand near the edge of the steep cliffs and throw down large chunks of meat. The gemstones on the ground stick to the meat, and when these birds of prey take the meat and fly to their nests on the top of the cliffs, people climb to the outside of the nests, scare the birds away, and take the gemstones.</p>
<p>Having witnessed this, I came up with a plan to help me escape this valley, as I knew for sure that I couldn't climb out on my own.</p>
<p>First, I put all the gemstones I could find and the remaining food into my bag. Then, using my headscarf, I tied a large piece of meat to my body, and lay face down on the ground, with the bag of gemstones pressing tightly against my belt. Soon, many eagles flew down to eat and feed their young. One eagle grabbed the piece of meat I was tied to and flew me to a nest on top of a high cliff. The people I had mentioned indeed scared all the birds away, and one person came to the nest where I was.</p>
<p>He was shocked when he saw me. He thought I was there to steal his gemstones because this nest was his. You see, everyone has a nest, and they often consider it their own.</p>
<p>I thought he was going to mistreat me, so I told him not to worry, that I wasn't there to steal his gemstones.</p>
<p>I said, "In truth, I have more gemstones than you all combined. Moreover, you rely on chance to get them, while I picked them up in the valley."</p>
<p>I took out the gemstones from my bag and showed them to him. Before long, a large group of people surrounded me, and I told them everything that had happened since the ship abandoned me. I also gave a very valuable gemstone to the person who found me first. I happily spent the whole night with them. Afterward, I went with them to their camp and lived with them for a few days.</p>

<p>The Plunge in April Gold Standard Futures</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Desperately Liquidate Long Positions, Banks Struggle to Cope</p>
<p>Hitting a New Low of $909.5 Before Rebounding</p>
<p>Falling Below the $900 Mark If Swaps Are Factored In</p>
<p>The gold market has recently seen a loosening of holdings, the short sellers' momentum is overpowering, and the long position holders dare not act. Yesterday, the April contract just rolled over from March, with a total holding of only around 15,000 contracts. Many major players have ceased activity, making the market even looser. The sellers find it easy to operate, and once a decline begins, there's a lack of support. Furthermore, there are rumors of a major speculator wavering, leading many Chinese merchants to cut losses, and banks are struggling to cope. The foreign exchange market is strong, further exacerbating the decline and creating a new low. This is the largest decline since the imposition of the equalization tax, with the lowest price reaching $909.5. If swaps are factored in, with the long positions paying out $13, the price has secretly broken the $900 mark.</p>
<p>Finally, with the support of Sassoon and the banks, and the tightening of the foreign exchange market, the gold market rebounded from the decline. Unexpectedly, the overseas gold market continued to rise sharply in the morning. Reports surfaced that a Japanese parliament member advocated abandoning the gold standard and adopting the silver standard. Off-exchange trading opened at $26.7. With swaps factored in, the dark market saw further declines. Although it rebounded slightly afterward, the People’s Bank of China’s official exchange rate rose, and both the British and American exchange rates increased. The customs gold unit also fell by 1.1 fen, lowering the gold standard price to $948, but it remained weak. After the opening, the foreign exchange market loosened, leading to a downturn. However, due to bank support and the entry of major players, the market rebounded. It was anticipated that the HSBC exchange rate would also rise, and the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu also sold. The process remained loose, with Chinese merchants rushing to sell and aggressively cut losses. The foreign exchange market repeatedly became loose and flooded, with a dense atmosphere of selling in the market. Even if there were short-term gains, they were only temporary, and the price broke through the $20 mark. Rumors circulated that foreign banks wouldn't need passports to transport funds, but these rumors had little impact. At a time when buyers were hesitant and sellers were gathering, the downward trend intensified. There were occasional fluctuations along the way, but it ultimately created a new low of $909.5, after which the decline slowed slightly. Buyers then took advantage of the low prices to become active. Sassoon made up for short sales of sterling, and the banks continued to support. The short sellers eagerly bought to cover their positions, and the gold price gradually rebounded, once approaching the $20 mark. However, at noon, it was still fluctuating. The trading was chaotic in the first half of the day, and the actions of fellow traders were erratic and difficult to grasp. Swaps, due to the large short positions being paid, had fallen to within $11. Here is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day.</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at $927.6, which was an increase of $8.9 compared to the previous close, but still a decrease of over $4 if swaps are factored in. Chun Yuan, Yong Rui, and Kang did enter the market, but Fu Xing, Yong Qian, Chang Xiang, and Da De Cheng actively sold, causing it to fall to $5.3. Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, Yong Yu, and Qing took the opportunity to enter, reaching $6.8. The May US dollar was difficult to sell at $43.75. Fu Xing, Yong Heng Yu, and Da De Cheng sold down to $4.8. Fu Chang, Fu Xing, Yong Yu, Qing Yong, Fu Xing, Qing Fa, and Yong Fu entered, rising to $6. The April US dollar was difficult to sell at $8.75.

Yu Qing Yong, Fu Yu, and Da De Cheng re-entered, rising to $5. Yuan Chang, Yong Yi Feng, Yuan Mao, and Yong and others continued to sell. Although the banks were supporting, the process remained tight and gradually declined. The Banque Belge supported the April sterling at $75, but it soon became difficult to maintain. It was anticipated that the HSBC exchange rate would rise by 125 for sterling and 25 for US dollars. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sold sterling, causing Heng Yu, Yuan Mao, Yong Fu Sheng, and Yong Yu Xin Xiang to sell aggressively, falling to $2. Pan Gen Na's April US dollar was already $36.125. Da De Cheng Heng Yu Na stabilized slightly. Yuan Mao Yong Fu Yu sold aggressively, falling to $0.05. Fu Xing Yong Zhao Feng Chang entered at $1,500. Qing Yu, Heng Yu, Yuan Chang, Yong Fu Yu, Shun Mao, Yuan Sheng Yong, and Wan Chang Yong sold off, retreating into the $20 mark, at $19.5. The Banque Belge supported the March sterling at 6 pence and stabilized slightly. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged. At this time, it struggled around $20, but the foreign exchange market was tight, and people's hearts were inclined to decline. Heng Yu, Yuan Chang Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Qing Yu Chang, Da Da Fa Yong, Qing Fa Yong sold aggressively, and the downward trend started again. Da Fa Yong and Fu Xing Yong competed to sell, falling to $13.8. Banque Belge supported the March US dollar at 625. Heng Yu Da Da Yuan, Yi Fu Xing Yong bought to cover, rebounding to $6. Before long, the April US dollar could be closed out at $3.75. Fu Xing Yong Wan Xing Fu Yu Jin Feng Yong sold off, falling again to $2.5. Heng Yu Da De Cheng, Fu Xing Yong Fu Tai Heng Wan Xing sold to cover, rising to $4.4. Fu Xing Yong Yuan Chang Yong Heng Xing Yuan Mao Yong sold off bravely, breaking the $10 mark, retreating to a low of $9.5. Sassoon supported the April sterling at $93.75. Yuan Yi, Heng Yu, Da De Cheng, Qing Fa Yong Wan Xing Fu Yu Yu Li jointly paid and recovered. Before long, Zhengjin bought the March sterling at $1.25. Yi Cheng, Heng Yu, Qing Fa Yong Da De Cheng Fu An Yuan Chang Yong competed to enter, gradually rebounding to $18.8. Heng Yu Fu Xing Yong Hui Xiang took the opportunity to sell high, retreating to $6.5. Yuan Chang Yong Wan Xing re-entered at $8.5. Fu Xing Yong Tong Yu Run Fu Chang sold again down to $6.5. Heng Xing Zhao Feng Chang entered at $7.7. The foreign exchange market hardened. Fu Yu Heng Yu Yu Li Yuan Mao Yong sold aggressively, retreating to $4.5. Fu Xing Yong Yuan Chang Yong Fu An Da De Heng Xing Yuan Qian Chang Xiang continuously bought in, rising to $9.5. Fu Xing Yong Tong Tai Chang Heng Yu and others took the opportunity to sell high, retreating to $6.2. At this time, due to the news that Mitsui was paying $3.75 for the April gold and $0.0625 for the March sterling, it rebounded to $7.5. Da Fa Yong Heng Yu Hong Xing Heng Chang Yong had a strong intention to sell, and fell to $5.5. Qian Chang Xiang Yu Qing Yong and others still entered. After fluctuating, the noon close was $917.3. At the close, Yuan Yi, Chun Yuan Yong, and Hui Xiang sold, once falling to within $5. Shen Kang and Da Lian Bang Da De Cheng came in, rising to outside $7. Chun Yuan Yong Fu Xing Yong Yu Qing Yong sold again to $6. Fu Yu and others came in. Finally, it rose again to outside $7. It was found that the highest price in the first half of the day was $927.6, and the lowest price was $909.5, a difference of $18.1. As a result, it fell by $1.4 compared to the previous close. If swaps are factored in, the premium is $14.</p>
<p>The closing price of the People's Bank of China's gold standard was lowered to $948, about $31 less than the closing price, and $4 less than the previous close. The March listing rose to $906, and the April listing was $917. The morning water replenishment was $898, and the gold price was reduced by $9 to $918.6. The spot market remained quiet, but the additional water fell due to the swap premium of $13 paid by the long positions. Tianjin goods were $6 less than the gold standard, and there were no transactions. The initial shout of the swap was a premium of over $13 paid by the short positions, but there were no buyers. Hui Xiang was the first to pay, falling to $12.8. Zheng Chang Ren Fa Yong and others paid, rising back to over $13. Yuan Chang Yong paid $13.5 to Bu An for seven items. Later, Qian Chang Xiang Yi Cheng Heng Yu Da De Cheng Tian Feng and others paid, falling again to within $13. After that, there was a lack of large long positions. Qian Chang Xiang and Heng Yu and others paid one after another, repeatedly lowering the price, finally falling to a low of $10.0.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was extremely chaotic. In summary, Chun Yuan Yong Jian Kang Heng Chang Yong Fu Xing Yong Yuan Mao Yong Qing Fa Yong Heng Yu Da Fa Yong Fu Tai Heng Yi Feng Yong Qing Yu Fu Chang Zhao Feng Chang and others were on the selling side. Da De Cheng Wan Xing Yi Cheng Fu An Shun Mao Chang Da Fu Yu Shun Li Yu Qing Yong Rui Kang Qian Chang Xiang Da Shun and others were on the buying side.

<p>Chinese Merchants Dump Over 1 Million in US Dollars</p>
<p>Sassoon and Banks Maintain Stability</p>
<p>According to foreign news reports yesterday, London’s major contracts, both near and far, rose by 1.875. It was said that after the market closed, the United States bought in at an official exchange rate plus 0.0625. New York’s silver price rose by 0.375, London’s raw gold rose by 2 pence, the British pound against the US dollar narrowed by half a point, the British pound against the French franc remained unchanged, the US dollar against the British pound fell by 0.25, and the US dollar against the French franc rose by 0.25. Reports stated that a Japanese member of the House of Peers proposed abandoning the gold standard and adopting the silver standard. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices, with British exchange rates at 1 shilling and 6 pence, and US exchange rates at $36.5625. Compared to the previous close, both British and American exchange rates were slightly looser. The People’s Bank of China raised the official exchange rate, increasing by 125 in total, with US dollars increasing by 25, and the customs gold unit falling by 1.1 fen again. It immediately became loose after the opening, mainly because Chinese merchants tended to cut long positions. However, the banks still supported, causing a lot of fluctuation. HSBC raised the official exchange rate, increasing by 125 for British pounds and 25 for US dollars. After this, a certain major player among the Chinese merchants wavered and cut long positions. Although the announcement of the silver equalization tax was unchanged, people’s hearts were extremely timid. Chinese merchants with long positions scrambled to close out, while short positions such as Ding Kang and others made codes. The banks were unable to maintain and were in a difficult position. Rumors circulated that the equalization tax would be cancelled, and that foreign banks wouldn’t need passports to enter and exit, causing the process to be extremely tight and loose beyond measure. Later, Sassoon took the opportunity to buy shorts cheaply, and the banks also competed to support, causing the process to change from loose to tight. However, because Fu Chang and others were taking US dollars and selling British pounds, they exchanged foreign exchange, causing the final situation to be uncertain. By the noon close, recent selling prices were British exchange rates at 1 shilling and 6 pence 115, and US exchange rates at $36.8125. Compared to the previous close, British exchange rates were 125 looser, and US exchange rates were 3125 tighter. The Chinese merchants all scattered and sold. Some short positions, such as codes, sold approximately 1 million US dollars and over 100,000 pounds of British exchange rates. Although the banks supported, they were not strong. Sassoon slightly supported British pounds, while the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sold. In addition, many Chinese merchants mainly sold British pounds and exchanged foreign exchange. The half-day transactions are recorded below.</p>

<p>Foreign Bank Discount Returned to a Small Fraction</p>
<p>Yesterday’s Opening Market at 9 Points</p>
<p>It has been more than a week since the opening of the market yesterday. According to past practice, it is the time when entries and exits are numerous and transactions gradually become prosperous. However, this year, the number of internal items has decreased due to the tight relationship between colleagues. However, it is still calm on the surface. The foreign bank discount market price has also fallen back by 1 point, changing to 9 points. The transaction volume of discount notes was more than 1.8 million in the morning, and the new transaction was more than 400,000. Because the noon market has not yet recovered, there is no market price for the head-drawing. Because of time constraints, the bank’s receipt and delivery were also inferior. It is estimated that foreign banks received and delivered more than 1 million in notes, more than 200,000 in telegraphic transfers, and more than 2.2 million in various remittance pledges. 200,000 was dispatched from the warehouse. Chinese banks received and delivered more than 1.4 million in notes, more than 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, more than 300,000 in special remittance payments, and more than 3.1 million in various remittance pledges and taxes. 300,000 was entered into the warehouse.

<h3 id="e185">The Securities and Bond Market Gradually Shows Weakness and Decline <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Nian San Pass Turmoil Temporarily Comes to a Short End</p>
<p>The market on the Hua Gao Securities Exchange yesterday was seen to be stable, but the trend gradually showed weakness. Due to the fact that most brokers didn't make new trades in the Nian San Pass turmoil, the manipulators had nowhere to use their skills, so the turmoil came to an end. The market sentiment was mostly weak, and there were no signs of loosening in terms of opening silver. The banking and money houses were as tight as ever, which was very different from the situation in previous Lunar New Years. Therefore, the bond industry was also affected by the inability to operate. There are not many days left in the February futures, and there will be many twists and turns in the future of the market price. As for yesterday's events, the opening market price for this month's issue fell sharply by 45 jiao, and people's hearts were discouraged by this. After that, most items saw weakness, with minor fluctuations of 5 fen to 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The number of Nian San Pass transactions was also much smaller than before, and the price was also slightly smaller by 4 jiao and a half. In the second round, numbers 4, 5 and 57, etc., were sold a lot, and number 32 was bought a little. The market price still showed more declines than increases. Nian San Pass continued to decline by 2 and 3 jiao, and number 96 was also weak and unable to rise. In summary, the market price mostly fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao to 3 jiao, and Nian San Pass fell by about 7 jiao. Only the long-term of the Nian Two Pass was still at 5 fen and 1 jiao. The total number of transactions was 11,815,000 yuan. The number of Nian Two Pass transactions was only 980,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (battle unit transaction unit 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Industrial Stocks Rise the Most</p>
<p>A report from the Xinfeng Foreign Firm stated that the Wall Street market was active yesterday (the 15th). Many stocks re-reached their highest peaks of this year, but public utility stocks were sluggish and showed no signs of improvement, falling to their lowest records of this year. It is said that the government strongly wants each power plant to reduce electricity rates and ban public utility securities companies. The Federal Trade Commission accused Edison Electric Society of failing to help public utility companies simplify their capital structure and of helping to destroy heavy industry and hindering the development of the electrical industry. Today, Studebaker cars fell to 1.5 jiao, which is the lowest record for this stock in history. Bonds also rose due to increased demand from investors. Small exchange stocks rose except for public utility stocks. The total number of transactions for the day was 730,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Prevalence of Cutting Losses on Yarn and Flower Yarn <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The market is heading toward a fatigued state, continuing to decline.</p>
<p>The yarn market is exhausted. The situation remains turbulent. Several thousand bales of yarn are due this month, yet no adequate solution is in sight. Consequently, buyers are anxious. Although mills are making daily adjustments, they struggle to stem the tide of selling. This underscores the severity of the yarn market. However, a certain cotton company, seeing the worsening environment, has painfully cut losses on a significant number of positions, causing the market to decline.</p>
<p>"Golden Rooster" Chips Abound</p>
<p>Before the auction of standard yarn, the market opened with stability across all months, primarily because the American and Indian cotton markets rebounded uniformly, leading to a wait-and-see approach. Some profit-takers covered their positions. A certain yarn mill from the interior continued to buy, helping to maintain prices. However, intelligence revealed a sudden softening at the third closing bell, as a cotton company cut losses on over ten thousand bales. The market shifted dramatically. As a result, all months fell by one or two jiao. News spread in the afternoon of large-scale liquidations by bullish investors. With such a large volume of chips in the market, the situation deteriorated, threatening floating positions. Those closing out positions surged in like a tide. Simultaneously, spot yarn sales became sluggish, causing the market to soften further. All months fell by four, five, six, or nine jiao. Sales included 5,050 bales from Da Feng, 1,000 bales from Da Fu, 1,050 bales from Geng Feng, 3,950 bales from Shen Chang, 1,650 bales from Sen Kang, 2,800 bales from Chang Feng, 1,450 bales from Run Kang, 850 bales from Xin Cheng, and 900 bales from Jun Chang. Purchases included 1,750 bales by Da Fu, 3,700 bales by Da Ji, 1,850 bales by Da Chang, 1,500 bales by Da Feng, 1,650 bales by Geng Feng, 1,100 bales by Rui Da, 900 bales by Chang Feng, 750 bales by Chang Yu, and 750 bales by He Xing. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Over Three Hundred Bales Actually Sold</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have once again turned sluggish. Statistics show that all guilds combined purchased only 380 bales throughout the day. Except for the Shen Xin mill's yarn price remaining steady, all others fell by five jiao. The breakdown of purchases by guild is as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market is steadily trending downwards, driven by rising exchange rates, new lows in gold prices, and instability in the yarn market. Furthermore, the Ningbo guild has delivered 4,000 dan of Yao cotton, while cotton inventories in this city have increased, further dampening buyer sentiment. In the afternoon, a certain company cut losses on a large scale, significantly loosening the market and making it difficult to support prices.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton: Bullish Investors Collapse</p>
<p>Before the auction of standard cotton, the market was relatively stable, with a considerable number of buyers resisting shorts. This was due to Indian cotton rising by two and a half rupees and American cotton rising by ten points. Consequently, all months rose by five fen. However, at the third closing bell, Da Feng abruptly unloaded over ten thousand dan. As gold prices continued to fall after futures settlement, bullish investors became disillusioned, causing the market to loosen significantly. The market suddenly changed. As a result, all months fell by five fen to one jiao. The market shifted dramatically after the afternoon opening bell, creating a sense of panic. With approximately 8,000 dan scheduled for delivery this month, the bullish front was breached by sellers. Furthermore, Yi Kang and Shen Chang did not cut losses on their large positions, making it even more difficult for the market to stabilize, leading to a collapse. All months fell by two or three jiao. Sales included 11,700 dan from Da Feng, 6,400 dan from Shen Chang, 11,300 dan from Yi Kang, 2,300 dan from Tong Ji, 2,500 dan from Ji Feng, 8,100 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, 3,800 dan from Yi Cheng, 40 dan from Chang Feng, and 2,400 dan from Xin Cheng. Purchases included 5,300 dan by Da Fu, 7,700 dan by Da Ji, 4,000 dan by Yuan Da, 3,000 dan by Yuan Da, 4,900 dan by Chang He, 4,800 dan by Rui Da, 1,600 dan by Ji Feng, and 1,600 dan by Shen Ji. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Mills' Spot Purchases Increasingly Sluggish</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is stagnant due to the persistent slump in yarn prices, leading to mills' increasingly hesitant purchases. The source included 1,520 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>41.50 for fire-damaged cotton Shen Xin Mill is purchasing 300 bales of spot goods for the mill. The Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange Market has announced that the February yarn and cotton futures will be delivered on the 27th of this month. Trading of the February futures will be suspended on the 23rd, 25th, and 26th. The market will be closed on the delivery day, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e187">US Cotton Counterparts Raise Prices, Purchasing Gold Bullion Cases Create Constraints <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened firmly, with all months rising by two to four points. Subsequently, due to positive news from Liverpool, counterparts purchased at limit prices. With few sellers, the market rose gradually. Bullish investors closed out March positions, which were absorbed by the Liverpool group and shifted to distant months. Most of the day's trading involved calendar spreads, with little off-market activity. In the afternoon, news that the gold bullion case might be resolved on Monday prompted counterparts to buy and shorts to cover, leading to continued gains. Spot demand showed slight improvement. The textile industry's appetite was also better. Hethorn estimated this week's mill consumption at 239,000 bales, and Liverpool's stock at 324,000 bales. The market closed strongly, with spot prices rising by ten points and futures prices rising by six to nine points. The British cotton market was strong, with spot prices rising by four points and futures prices rising by six points. The Indian cotton market initially weakened due to bullish liquidations but then strengthened due to Japanese purchases. Pingguoer rose by 2.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 1 rupee, and Bairuoxi rose by 2 rupees. Reported by Yuan Dianluo (15th).</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a Bombay dispatch, the predicted opening price for Bairuoxi cotton on the 16th is 249 rupees, an increase of 1.25 rupees compared to the previous day's close. A New York dispatch on the 15th reported on the week's cotton market: Although divergent opinions on the gold bullion case problem decreased during the past week, general interest remained weak, and overall uncertainty continued to constrain cotton trading. Currently, the underlying strength is considerable. There is no selling pressure from the South. Bullish liquidations and scattered selling were absorbed by some pricing and short-covering. However, these transactions were mostly calendar spreads or spreads with overseas markets. The March liquidations were also swap-related. Ground conditions in the South have improved, but the subsoil in the Southwest and Southeast still needs more rain. There is still no definite discussion on external exports. Industry players are awaiting developments in Washington and the Chamber of Commerce's ruling on the gold bullion case. The cotton market is extremely quiet. There is hope for improvement after the gold bullion case is resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Grain: New Rumors of a Boatload of Foreign Oats Settled. Flour Market Speculators Active <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, all months showed a consistent firmness. Foreign oats were quoted with Chicago up two or three jiao and Canada up one jiao six fen. When prices opened, the current month was stable due to successive purchases by northern merchants. Distant months were positive due to good reports on foreign oats and the absence of selling by mills. Therefore, bids for all months were also higher by one fen. However, at the afternoon opening, the current month remained steady due to active spot sales, but distant months suddenly plummeted. Rumors circulated that Fufeng had settled on a boatload of Australian wheat at a price of only four yuan, five jiao, and five fen. As a result, speculative selling was brisk, and prices fell sharply. Under current circumstances, the current month is unlikely to fall much due to active merchant sales, while the distant months will depend on wheat prices. As a result, the current month was down by half a fen, March was down by one fen and two and a half li, April was down by one fen and a half, May was down by one fen and two and a half li, June was down by one fen and a half, and July was down by one fen and two and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Insiders Stop Spreading, Buyers Watch, Numerous Short Positions Seen in Future Wheat <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the future wheat market opened in the morning, market conditions for all months were flat and quiet. Foreign oats were quoted with Chicago up two or three jiao and Canada up one jiao six fen. At the opening, trading in all months was sluggish. With little bidding, market price fluctuations were also small. However, at the afternoon opening, trading in all months was even quieter. Only the current month traded at the opening price, down by two fen from the previous day. Months after March were entirely bidless because insiders were unwilling to spread positions and buyers were mostly watching due to tight credit, resulting in extreme apathy. As a result, the current month was down by two fen, while the others were unchanged. Spot wheat was quiet. The factory was quite greedy and priced high quality wheat up by three to five fen, offering Dong Guide wheat at three yuan, nine jiao, and seven fen, and Yaowan wheat at three yuan, nine jiao, for an estimated 4,000 bags, which were purchased by Shen Da and Xin Da.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat: Canada claims that its inventory will be below 100 million bushels by the end of August. At the same time, due to a lack of rain in the winter wheat belt, manufacturers are purchasing May futures.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Second Grade Saigon Soars by Two Jiao <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market remained active, especially the No. 3 Saigon with 60 broken grains. Over ten thousand bags were traded again yesterday. The morning price was only nine yuan, one jiao, and eight fen to nine yuan and two jiao, already two or three fen higher than the previous market. In the afternoon, demand from Jiangsu and Zhejiang interiors was very strong, and Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Yangtze guilds in this street were also inquiring. The price rose again and again to nine yuan, three jiao, and eight fen, a significant increase of two jiao compared to the previous market. Furthermore, the price of the No. 3 Saigon road goods traded the day before (the ship is en route and will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of this month) opened only at nine yuan and four fen. Yesterday, another 600 tons of returned goods were traded. The price initially opened at five yuan and then surged to five yuan and three fen, an increase of nearly one jiao, and was even higher than the No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon futures. Because the spot price of the second grade Saigon also increased by five fen. Siamese rice remained stable. Various types of rice from Hou Dang and Annam all had new spot transactions, and the market was also strong. Although merchant Xian rice was initially viewed favorably due to high production prices, it has been affected by foreign rice and has become a stagnant situation.　　Jing rice producing areas intend to wait and see.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various guilds were even weaker than before, totaling only 14 or 15 lots (a total of over 3,000 shi). Sales in various markets were not brisk, but the situation seemed tight. As a result, the price of each thick Jing rice variety slightly rose by a few fen. Over 300 bags of late-season rice were sold by the Weihaiwei guild, and the market price also increased by five fen. However, considering the overall situation and the current environment with tight credit, it is speculated that the market may not show any strength and may continue to fluctuate in the long term. Due to the shortage of Du Jian rice, the market color is slightly better. Foreign Jian rice continued to lack market presence, while Yin Bian Yuan rice only showed a flat and weak trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, due to rising prices in the producing areas, the arrival of river goods did not match the Shanghai market, resulting in only a few goods arriving. Sales in the market were normal, and prices for overvalued goods were slightly adjusted by a few fen. The prices of the remaining goods remained stable. However, the price of thin rice was still down by about one jiao.</p>
<p>Bran Gu Prices Tighten Daily</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bran market remained tight, with inland guilds continuing to purchase. Mill inventories did not appear abundant, so bidding was again strong. For example, returned goods were bid at six jiao and a half net. Although mill prices have not been released, industry insiders believe that the opening price will be no less than seven jiao.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained soft. The guild's benchmark price for No. 24 crude sugar was seventeen yuan, six jiao, and a half, but no transactions occurred. There were also few transactions for the remaining Dutch red and Taikoo sugar. There were slight transactions for the original price of this factory's cotton white sugar. Some Guangzhou Chao guilds opened Hainan red sugar at eleven yuan and three jiao for about one hundred and several tens of bags, also Chong Ti Qing at ten yuan, two jiao, and a half to two jiao, and Wu Tong Ci Huang Gang Qing at nine yuan, nine jiao to eight jiao, totaling more than three hundred bags. Furthermore, the Jian guild opened tens of bags of Zhang Diao Qing at nine yuan and eight jiao.</p>

<p>Although sales of wood ear have not been brisk recently, inventories in the market are low, and the Han market has risen, so the trend is quite bullish. Sichuan ear opened at one hundred and nine yuan, a good increase of five yuan from before. Currently, both the Fujian and Guangdong guilds have demand. The top-tier wholesale price for Ding Sheng Hao's air-freighted small-packaged Sen ear is one hundred and eight yuan, Gao Zhuang's original-packaged ear is one hundred and four yuan, and Xuan Chang ear is ninety yuan, an increase of two yuan.</p>

<p>Overseas markets are sluggish, and exchange rates remain high. Recent sales of foreign-made silk appear unlikely to move upward. Domestic silk mills have very little appetite. The price of grade B silk is still above 500 taels outside the Customs. According to silk industry insiders, the estimated market price is currently not very firm, but it is also unlikely to decline significantly.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Thoughts on Celibacy <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Shen</p>
<p>In principle, a single life is an unhealthy life, and the existence of celibacy is unreasonable. However, under the current circumstances, many people have no choice but to live a single life. If we only circle around in theory without delving into reality, the conclusions we draw often have to be questioned. Therefore, although Mr. Yi Qiong repeatedly elaborated on the discussion of "The Ideals and Realities of Celibacy" (Women's Voice, Volume 3, Issue 7), he ultimately separated the ideal from reality.</p>
<p>Many people have no choice but to live a single life, which is an undeniable fact. However, we can observe this fact from two perspectives.</p>
<p>Some people (the absolute majority of those living single lives) do not embrace any celibacy at all, nor do they not need to get married (in fact, the opposite is true). It's just that the environment does not allow them to marry. Even if the standard for an ideal partner is low, marriage is still impossible for them.</p>
<p>Some people, although not born to be celibate and have never said "I don't need to get married," in order to "strive for social causes," find that not only can they not obtain a "happy marriage" or a "satisfactory partner," but they cannot even maintain a decent life. They feel that they should put the interests and needs of their personal life after the interests and needs of their cause. When a burden of "suffering" is placed before them, they willingly take it up because marriage "can indeed hinder their efforts in social causes."</p>
<p>The former are forced to do so, entirely determined by circumstances. The latter, in addition to objective reasons, also involve subjective factors through their reason. The former are single people but not celibates. There is no need to tell them the unreasonableness of celibacy, its anti-physiological nature, and so on, because they know it as well as you do. The latter can be called celibates (because they do it consciously). The focus of the problem lies here. No matter how you condemn celibacy with a death sentence and exile, they still have to remain single.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many freaks in the world who regard celibacy as a final belief and adhere to it. There are also people who embrace celibacy as a strategy of "retreating to advance," hoping to sell themselves at a good price. But these people are in the minority, or at least only a part. Only these people are worth launching a total attack on their minds.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Yi Qiong seems to be treating a strand of cow hair as a whole cow.</p>
<p>It is true that Mr. Yi Qiong has said that for those who strive for social causes and consciously practice celibacy, this cannot be used as a reasonable basis for celibacy. He said that it "belongs to a social problem of a different nature." But here, Mr. Yi Qiong inevitably fixed the concept of "celibacy" as if celibacy is always unacceptable everywhere. I feel that this view is like regarding capitalism as absolutely lacking revolutionary nature, forgetting the specific, temporal, and spatial conditions. According to my immature understanding, we should generally adopt a negative attitude towards celibacy, but we must also have a little reservation. Erasing this reservation is no small mistake. Even for those who embrace celibacy to accomplish more important social causes, we should not only forgive them but also admire them. Among those people, advocating celibacy (which has been given a new content) and creating a trend of celibacy is definitely not a mistake.</p>
<p>In a word, regarding celibacy as an end is a ridiculously absurd act, but regarding it as a means is sometimes necessary. At the same time, those who practice celibacy as a means are actually fundamentally burying this "unreasonable" phenomenon, just as some people's death is for the sake of others' life.</p>
<p>I dare say that celibacy in this sense is definitely not "non-resistance." If a suitable metaphor is to be found in strategy, it can probably be said to be a "scorched earth" policy.</p>
<p>Immature opinions, please enlighten me, Mr. Yi Qiong.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Lectures on Women's Issues <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>Lecture 1: The Significance of Studying Women's Issues</p>
<p>Section 1: The Concept of Women's Issues</p>
<p>Simply put, the so-called women's issue is the issue of how to liberate women from their subordinate relationship to men. In other words, it is the issue of how to enable women to obtain a completely equal status with men in politics, economics, and society. It includes women's participation in politics, legal issues, educational issues, occupational issues, labor issues, and maternity protection issues, etc.</p>
<p>The reason why the women's issue has become an issue naturally has its historical reasons.</p>
<p>Historically, since the collapse of the primitive clan commune system and the emergence of private ownership of property, although inequality phenomena such as wealth, nobility, masters, and slaves have been found in human society, at the same time, women, who account for half of humanity, have also lost their status as "human beings" and become a kind of slave arbitrarily controlled by men. This phenomenon is particularly evident in feudal society. In the feudal era, the subordinate relationship of women to men was like the relationship of serfs to lords. It was no longer a relationship between people but a relationship between a person and an object. That is to say, men treated women like a cow or a chair, able to use them at will, abandon them at will, and even destroy them at will! In the "civilized" capitalist society, the subordinate relationship between men and women seems to have eased somewhat on the surface under the guise of so-called freedom and equality, but in fact, women still become objects of male oppression, playthings, and insults. In this way, the so-called women's issue has existed since the collapse of the clan commune system. In other words, this problem has existed with the continuation of a certain social system, rather than occurring by chance. However, it was promoted by the modern bourgeoisie only during the rise of capitalism.</p>
<p>When the commoner class built modern industrial cities on the ruins of feudal society and confronted and fought against feudal forces, they did propose many noteworthy issues, such as the issue of democracy in politics, the issue of equality in educational rights, the issue of freedom of occupation, the issue of serf liberation, and even the issue of women's liberation. However, the proposal of these issues was also for the sake of its own growth and development. Because the capitalist mode of production itself requires the solution of these problems.</p>
<p>However, the issue of women's liberation that the bourgeoisie wanted to propose and solve, like its political democratic issues, could not be thoroughly resolved. For example, women's participation in politics, educational issues, occupational issues, etc., have still not been fundamentally resolved in the most advanced European and American capitalist countries, and there is still a vast difference between the social status of men and women. The reason is very simple. That is because although the bourgeoisie overthrew the unreasonable feudal society, it also created an unreasonable social system itself. In this way, in an unreasonable society, fair and reasonable things will never exist.</p>
<p>When capitalism reached the stage of imperialism, essential changes were brought about in the issue of women's liberation. Especially after the European War, the number of female workers in various capitalist countries increased day by day, and they showed great strength in the labor movement. As a result, class divisions occurred in the past women's movement, resulting in the so-called liberation movement of working women, which was opposed to the equality of rights movement of middle-class intellectual women. On the other hand, the establishment of socialist countries in the Soviet Union and some other countries established a new society of true equality between men and women, fundamentally solving the women's issue that capitalist countries could not solve, giving women all over the world a very profound excitement and stimulation. As a result, the significance of the women's issue expanded from the issue of the liberation of women from men to the issue of the liberation of women from the social system.</p>
<p>Many reformist women's activists now believe that women can obtain a completely equal social status with men in the existing state, but this is just a dream. Naturally, in the current society, a small number of upper-class women have the possibility of receiving higher education, engaging in high-level occupations, or even participating in high-level political organizations, but this has nothing to do with the liberation of the entire women.</p>
<p>We believe that to solve the women's issue, the first is to eliminate women's social dependence on men, and the second is to eliminate women's economic dependence on men. However, the elimination of these two relationships cannot be realized under a male-centered social system. Therefore, the women's liberation movement will inevitably merge into the movement to change the unreasonable society and build an equal and reasonable society. Because only in this way can the fundamental liberation of women be achieved!</p>
<h3 id="e196">Combing Up <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Ming</p>
<p>"Combing up" was once a very popular behavior in a certain period in Shunde County, Guangdong. When the silk industry was booming, it was excessively revered and regarded as sacred in places where mulberry silkworms were raised, and it was used by the girls there to resist unsatisfactory "marriages" in a hostile manner.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1916, in Dunmu Township, Ah Xiu, the eldest daughter of Wu Furu, who owned several acres of mulberry fields, held her combing ceremony with the help of her capable aunt, without allowing anyone to stop her. Furu, a kind and amiable father, was very lively in greeting his daughter's companions, except for being dissatisfied with his sister, Ah Lan, buying an extra goose.</p>
<p>"What? A woman only has such a day once in her life, so let Ah Xiu have a decent one," Ah Lan replied to her brother, her mouth and the flesh of her cheekbones being pulled up by a knife scar on her left cheek, forming an ugly dimple. This woman, who didn't like to talk much except to explain things in a lecturing tone, was like a water chestnut that had been thrown into a salt jar, often making people forget her existence. Even after dinner that night (because those married female guests left after eating, rarely playing with the girls who had already combed up or were yet to be married until dawn), when the remaining girls surrounded Ah Xiu like a besieged city, snatching olives, the crooked-mouthed aunt stood in a corner of the room, as if supervising the battle with her hands, without smiling or saying anything. In short, no matter what the occasion, it was very rare for her to express any emotion. As if seduced by those intense emotional gestures, she reluctantly agreed to the girls' request and told a story with a didactic meaning that was very suitable for her status.</p>
<p>Like a group of mischievous little sparrows, the young women deliberately indulged themselves in this night. They did whatever came to their mouths or hands. The furniture and beds in the room were all moved from their original positions. Several mischievous fellows enthusiastically played various roles, performing a temporarily composed play to insult the groom. Ah Xiu, who had just had her hair combed into a bun by a long-lived elder, was teased and humiliated with honorable shyness by completely well-meaning vulgar words, making her companions even happier.</p>
<p>"Crooked-mouth Aunt Lan, tell us something, huh? Didn't you join the Sisterhood?" a girl with a pointed chin of eighteen or nineteen years old suddenly shouted towards the corner. Knowing that people agreed with her proposal, she continued even more excitedly, "Tell us how your mouth got crooked, was it your own fault or..."</p>
<p>"Based on what you think, can my mouth tell any nice stories?" Aunt Lan smiled, her mouth even more crooked like a sweet star fruit. "How about I sing a song for you?"</p>
<p>The girls shook her body frantically, and she closed her eyes, raised her head, and sang the melancholic words in a very heavy, slow tone, like the dying cry of a wild beast crushed by a large stone.</p>
<p>"Using thread and needle:</p>
<p>For the sake of, a free body!</p>
<p>Good sisters, don't complain about tight clothes. You say,</p>
<p>Rather let the flower wither than let the butterfly invade!"</p>
<p>She opened her eyes wide, looked at everyone, and then gave a strange laugh. "You eat too little rice, you wouldn't know. Was the Sisterhood like your muddle-headed appearance now? Alas, this is a sacred matter! Which woman, when unwilling to die and meet the Jade Emperor, doesn't try to be as clean as Guanyin? So those who joined the party had to swear never to approach men. If they were forced by their parents to marry, then, before getting into the sedan chair, the sisters would have to sew up her little shirt and pants skillfully and carefully, and everyone would cry and sing as if their mother had died." She spoke very clearly, as if wanting people to put every word into their ears. "But once, there was a joke in Shibu Township. That girl was a distant cousin of my mother, who grew up relying on a pair of fierce elder brothers and sisters-in-law. She got married, and her underwear was sewn up by the sisters. Things were very coincidental—her man was a very clever fellow; on the wedding night, he carried a pair of scissors on his body, preparing to cut open those stitches; but unfortunately, my mother's cousin was not a piece of wood. In the rush, she pierced her belly—"</p>
<p>"Ah, is she going to die?" someone shouted.</p>
<p>Many girls worriedly grimaced and huddled behind Ah Xiu, who was sitting like the Buddha, as if playing a game of stacking Arhats.</p>
<p>"The matter was very simple: she fell out with her in-laws and turned against her elder brothers and sisters-in-law, but she lived a relaxed life, respected like a hero. Until the early summer of her twenty-fourth year—a very dull noon—she and the single out-of-town fireman in the silk factory, like two silkworms that hadn't spun silk, were seen behind the silk factory's warehouse, under the grass shed where no one usually went..."</p>
<p>"Oh, why was that? ——"</p>
<p>"It's like this, too bad!" a girl said mechanically.</p>
<p>"Who knows what this is for!" The crooked-mouthed woman closed her eyes again. "She actually did that. Such dishonorable things happen often! But think about it, are our ears willing to load these poisonous juices?"</p>
<p>Everyone was very neatly silent for a very short time, and then expressed their opinions unsystematically. They felt great interest in this kind of question, just like they needed some encouragement and stimulation in that gloomy and monotonous life...</p>
<p>"Do you understand, children? Have you really not heard this story?"</p>
<p>"Is there more? Tell us a little more!" a young and fat girl said, her voice a little unnatural, like a machine pretending to be calm after a big thunder.</p>

<h3 id="e197">World Women's Congress <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Min Jun</p>
<p>Recently, progressive women from various countries, in view of the inherent contradictions and various problems that cannot be solved in various countries, are now fraught with crises, fearing that this will lead to a world war; at the same time, since Western fascism gained power in Europe, it has spared no effort to oppress the women's movement. For example, the status of women in German society today has been almost completely deprived, and the slogan "Women, go back to the kitchen" is sung loudly. Therefore, a World Women's Congress was launched, which was held from August 4th to 7th last year in the Mutual Aid Society Hall (Ｐalaio　de　la　Mntnahte) on Mengci Street (Ｒue　Monge) in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. This journal has briefly recorded the news. The details of the meeting are listed again as follows:</p>
<p>There are many matters discussed at this conference. The women representatives of various countries have different ideals and beliefs, so the debates when discussing the proposals are often extremely fierce, but they are completely unanimous on the important points. They understand that in today's capitalist society, so-called women's liberation and world peace are impossible: they all acknowledge that (the bad environment of capitalism creates economic panic, economic panic promotes outward-aggression imperialism, and when imperialism reaches maturity, it intensifies war, which is an inevitable result. At the same time, capitalism is the enemy of the liberation of ordinary women and working women.)</p>
<p>They recognized the root of these obstacles to the healthy development of society. Therefore, the representatives unanimously voted on the resolutions proposed by the various committees. Based on those resolutions, it can be seen that this women's congress is of great significance, and women's thoughts are profound and their vision is broad. There are many resolutions and cannot be listed one by one: all the representatives hold a spirit of firm struggle. The opinions of the conference can be summarized into two factions:</p>
<p>The Young Women's Faction advocates: "Women all over the world should quickly seek the early realization of the women's anti-war and anti-imperialism declaration;</p>
<p>The Pacifist Faction advocates: "Women all over the world should refuse to participate in all work that engages in aggressive war or prolongs hostility."</p>
<p>Therefore, it was decided that women should not work in imperialist arsenals that manufacture killing tools; women all over the world should not participate in aggressive military organizations. The Lyon branch of the French Women's Peace and Freedom League (Ｌa　section　de　la　Ligne　des　femmes　pour　la　paix　et　Lyon　de　la　liberte) proposed that women all over the world should not participate in any aggressive military rescue teams. Later, female railway workers and the wives of railway workers put forward a noteworthy proposal: when imperialism engages in aggressive war, they should try their best to stop it. They cooperate with railway workers, shipbuilding workers, sailors, metallurgical workers, and road transport workers, and the means they take are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Oppose the manufacture and transportation of military supplies;</p>
<p>B. Stop the transportation of all military and police forces that suppress workers struggling for survival.</p>
<p>Female teachers teach that they must refuse imperialist aggressive propaganda when teaching.</p>
<p>In addition to the resolutions, the conference also issued a declaration, and a few sentences are specially excerpted below:</p>
<p>"We women see that mankind is threatened by unprecedented disasters. We have the right to resist and overthrow this disaster, this is our duty and mission..."</p>
<p>The conference also listed the resolutions into a code, summarizing that they demand absolute liberation of women, equal status in society, and opposition to imperialism and war: in addition, they engage in the liberation movement of oppressed people—without distinction of race or nationality. They believe that since women are human beings, they should be allowed to develop freely, their abilities, and allowed to work freely.</p>
<p>They have now returned to engage in the work of their transformation plan. It is still unknown what the effect will be in the future, but this conference has aroused great attention from world opinion.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Introducing "The Life of Soviet Women" <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Wen</p>
<p>Written by Fan, published by Shanghai Wenku of Shen Bao, actual price of two dimes</p>
<p>The new country of the "Soviet Union," although it has long been recognized by various countries in the world, and China and the Soviet Union have resumed diplomatic relations for many years, most people still talk about the Soviet Union with horror. The Soviet women in most people's minds are still occupied by concepts such as "common wives" and "state-owned." But in fact, what is the life of Soviet women like? Talking about this "Life of Soviet Women" can give you a clear answer.</p>
<p>According to the author's preface, he has studied in the Soviet Union for many years and visited many centers of large-scale industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Therefore, he has a real understanding and experience of the life of Soviet women.</p>
<p>What is here is a description of real life, without exaggeration or propaganda. It is not a legendary myth. Anyone who has doubts about the life of Soviet women must read it.</p>
<p>The whole book consists of sixteen chapters, including family life, marriage and divorce, love, children, increased cultural level, economic liberation, women's labor and pure rights protection, political life, decoration, music, and women's publications, totaling more than 30,000 words.</p>
<p>Mr. Pu Shunqing, Guan Lu, Guo Zhenyi, Xie Qing, Qian Yuzhen, She Ying, and others:</p>
<p>Please send a replacement imprint for remittance.</p>
<p>Editorial office</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the editor of Women's Garden:</p>
<p>This person cannot be tolerated by the descendants of Mr. Li, and has no choice but to remarry. Although this may not conform to the old ethics of our country, it is not hindered by today's laws and new moral laws. However, social discourse and the Qing Municipal authorities are dissatisfied with this person. This person had no choice but to come south alone, intending to find a Zen nunnery on the West Lake, singing scriptures and raising fish, to end this life. What else can be said? However, yesterday I heard a news item in your newspaper about the remarriage of a phoenix. Not only was there no criticism from society, but the new words of affection were broadcast as beautiful words. This person believes that this person and Mr. Xiong are both living in the same world, the only difference is the gender. However, between one marriage and one remarriage, the arguments of right and wrong are as different as the abyss. Contemporary sages are advocating equality between men and women. This person, as a weak woman, cannot help but feel deeply. Therefore, I have slightly altered Mr. Xiong's new words and composed another poem to express my meaning. Although I know it is inappropriate, I sing while crying. I have always admired.</p>
<p>Your newspaper advocates public opinion, please publish my work in the Women's Garden column to seek the correction of the great masters of the world.</p>
<p>This person respectfully informs you on February 10th</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>To Ms. Ben Wei:</p>
<p>This is probably your own handwriting, and I will publish it here without changing a word.</p>
<p>We believe that your past actions—remarriage—were brave and justified. But today, after hearing the letter, I know that you are being chased by public opinion and hindered by Qing City's eviction, and have quietly gone south. From now on, you will end this life with scriptures and fish. This is a bit too weak.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, if you think he can be a friend and a husband, and neither party is deceiving in the slightest, I think you should continue your previous courage and live together. The feudal poison in this society can only be leveled by our "practice." Retreat is the act of the weak! Otherwise, if you really don't want to get married, you don't have to take such a passive attitude. You are aware that social public opinion is so unfair, praising old men remarrying young women, and demeaning weak women remarrying. You also know that this society can only be truly equal if everyone who suffers and is oppressed unite to transform it. You should understand that passive retreat is harmful to yourself and does no good to others. It is better to actively strive forward to do some work that is beneficial to others and can also comfort yourself. I wonder what you think?</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>Alas, looking back on the past, happy years have turned into suffering and disease, making me haggard. Chopping down trees for women's rights, the new life can only be achieved through spiritual struggle. Li Yun went to Huai, pitying the willow, the天赋人权本自由 (tianfu renquan ben ziyou - God-given human rights are inherently free), begging the needle god to embroider the mandarin ducks again. Playing the pipa on the Qingdao, composing new sounds. Although not raising the case together like a humble wife. Hearts in harmony, like in childhood. The circumstances are rich. Etiquette devours people, and the ceremony is boiling. The laughter of the sea rises like stubborn foam. It's none of your business, like ripples on a spring water</p>

<h3 id="e199">Professional Women and Reading <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>For the sake of life, I have been pressed in the vise of a profession for ten years. In the past ten years, I have wasted my time and made no progress; at the same time, I have met many others with the same problem who have made little or no progress, and my heart is saddened when I think about it.</p>
<p>In modern times, lower-middle-income jobs generally involve more than eight hours of work a day. After work, men and women naturally rarely come into contact with books after returning home exhausted, but it seems even more so for women. Therefore, it is very difficult to ask women for some common sense, whether they are in the family or in social service. This situation is mostly due to the environment, and partly due to one's own failure to break the inherited habits.</p>
<p>Inherited habits: women have long been isolated from knowledge and society, and have no interest in books. Although times have changed and women often go to school, the biggest purpose of reading is to get a diploma; the biggest use of a diploma is, first, to find a job, and second, to use it as decoration. When a woman gets a diploma and finds a job, she has reached the final stage of reading and has fulfilled the greatest role of reading; afterwards, she lives a plain and unpursued life, just like a woman who has not read.</p>
<p>As for the environment, women are still in women's environment today. Married professional women are troubled by housework after returning from work. Unmarried professional women mostly associate with aunts and sisters, and mostly talk about decorations, entertainment, love, and gossip. Because the national situation is becoming more and more dangerous and the pressure is increasing, men's heads are lowered by three feet, and women are not allowed to raise their heads even more. Not only is there no opportunity to enlighten her with meaningful and soaring ambitions, but there is only opportunity to suppress her with dust, so she becomes meaningless without knowing it.</p>
<p>However, time is the true pearl of life, and knowledge is the true grain of life. It is helpless for professional women to use part of the pearls as firewood and part of the grain as dregs due to the limitations of life: if they simply abandon both completely, making their lives exhausted, withered, and dim, not only will they not be able to contribute much to society, but society will not need you either; as a result, the profession that you rely on will also become a problem. Therefore, for the sake of enriching life and maintaining a profession, professional women must find ways to read and seek some new knowledge. The most important things here are:</p>
<p>1. Read newspapers and magazines: Newspapers and magazines—especially newspapers—are full of social phenomena and world phenomena; on them, you can understand the international situation, the situation in China, and your own position. Then study how to deal with the situation and devote yourself to meaningful work.</p>
<p>2. Read books within the industry: If the profession is sometimes not entirely consistent with what you have learned, it will be easy to be incompetent, so you need to study more. Sometimes what you have learned may even be consistent with the profession, but you must always study new theories and new methods, so that your knowledge and skills will improve day by day and not be pushed back by the new waves;</p>
<p>3. Read books on social sciences: Professional women have entered society, and if they still only value the family and do not strive to understand society, they are wasting their lives. Why is one's own profession so shaky? Why is the social situation so unstable? Tracing back layer by layer, exploring the source, books on social science will be able to give you answers.</p>
<p>In short, today, professional women rarely see any writing in their eyes except for fashion magazines, movies, or advertisements for discounted foreign goods. As a result, the knowledge that she slightly instilled in her early years has evaporated and dried up after many years. Some women who have been in office for a long time often become stubborn and shallow, and are unbearable to talk to those with a little common sense. This has become a common and painful phenomenon. Professions solve life, and solving life extinguishes spirituality; and some people are complacent and content with this, so how can women grow</p>

<h3 id="e200">A Visit to the Laborers' Nursery <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>I had this thought for a long time—to visit a laborers' nursery. In the end, every time the thought stirred, I was entangled by other things.</p>
<p>This day, I made a special resolution—I had to go and see it. So, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I found the nursery I had been longing to visit on Penglai Road.</p>
<p>The nursery was located in a five-room building in the Qinpanfang alley. Upon entering, there was a living room that also served as an auditorium. In the center, a portrait of the Party, the Nation, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen was solemnly hung. Below it, there was a large dining table and four sofas, all covered with snow-white cloth covers. As soon as I stepped over the threshold, I instinctively felt a solemn and lonely atmosphere rushing towards me, and I was stunned for a moment. After a while, a tea servant came out from inside, and I handed him my business card to take in. When the tea servant came out again, a lady followed behind, wearing a blue cotton qipao, with glasses and a smile on her face, walking towards me, asking, "Is this Mr. Shen?" What can I do for you? Her attitude was noticeably very kind.</p>
<p>I quickly stood up, smiling and answering, "I wouldn't dare! I heard that your institution is doing very well, so I made a special trip here to visit. Yes, I haven't had the pleasure of asking your name yet?"</p>
<p>"My name is Zhu; there's not much achievement to speak of, we've only just started." She gestured for me to sit down and then sat down again.</p>
<p>"You're too kind, the achievements must be very good, I believe it. But I don't know how the organization here is structured. I hope that if Ms. Zhu is not busy, you can tell me." I began to present my request to her.</p>
<p>"Sure, I don't have anything to do right now; but our organization is very simple, I'm afraid there aren't any good materials to provide to Mr. Shen." She smiled faintly, and then said, "The director here is Mr. Li Ting'an, and there is also a vice-director, followed by an administrative and nanny director, as well as a teacher and three nanny trainees."</p>
<p>"The nanny director is Ms. Zhu, right?" I asked tentatively.</p>
<p>"..." She smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"What is the monthly income and expenditure here?"</p>
<p>"The recurring expenses are four hundred and fifty dollars. The building is provided free of charge by the Education Bureau, so with so much funding, the expenses are sufficient. However, the fees for childcare are pitifully low, with only thirteen children in total, generating only twenty dollars of income per month. This amount of money is not enough to cover the living expenses of two children!" She couldn't help but laugh as she said this.</p>
<p>"The children entrusted here are mostly from the working class, right?"</p>
<p>"Well! It's not as much as people generally assume. Among the thirteen children, five are from the working class, one from the education sector, three from the business sector, three from the police and national defense sector, and one from the banking sector—"</p>
<p>"Banking sector?" I interrupted her and asked.</p>
<p>"Yes!" She said calmly, "This child's father is a staff member of the Zhonghui Bank. Because he has five children, this is the youngest one. The mother really can't take care of all five children so thoroughly, so he came here to</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>ask us to entrust this child here. Of course! The nursery is supposed to serve the general public, so we agreed to his request. However, when the number of working-class children here exceeds the quota in the future, we will still have to notify him to take the child back." She explained in detail.</p>
<p>It felt like a stone had been lifted from my heart, and I felt lighter. I then asked, "What are the hours for childcare and how do you educate them?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Li believes that, in terms of the child's feelings for the family, they should not be separated from their families. Daytime care is due to family circumstances, which is not a problem, but they must go back at night. Moreover, boarding at the nursery would place too much responsibility on us. So, the childcare hours here are from 7:00 to 8:00 in the morning, when family members bring the children to the nursery; and from 6:00 to 7:00 in the afternoon, when family members pick them up again. Each child's family member is issued a 'care certificate,' which they must bring when picking up the child; otherwise, the nursery staff will send the child home. We don't accept boarding children for now. The children eat five meals a day: breakfast at 7:30 in the morning, a snack at 10:00, lunch at 12:00. Nap time is from 12:30 to 2:30 in the afternoon, every day. Some children haven't developed this habit at home, so when they first come here, they can't sleep as quietly as the other children, but after a few days, they gradually get used to it. There is another snack at 3:30 in the afternoon, and dinner at 6:00. Each meal consists of a soup and two dishes, and each person has a small basin and two small bowls, eating separately like a Western meal."</p>
<p>"Are the children's clothes also provided by the nursery?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we even made a special uniform: the shirt is white and the pants are blue, and the style is not bad. However, the families of the children all have this idea, thinking that wearing the nursery's clothes doesn't seem very elegant. So now we don't give them clothes to wear." She said, standing up and inviting me, "Mr. Shen, if you want to visit, I can accompany you upstairs now."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay; please lead the way!" I hurriedly agreed.</p>
<p>Passing through the living room, we reached the office area. There were three desks and some calligraphy and paintings hanging on the walls, arranged in an orderly manner. Behind this room, there was also a clothing room, filled with more than a dozen wardrobes taller than people, full of children's clothes. When children arrive at the nursery in the morning, they must first come here to change into the nursery's uniform; and in the evening, they change back into their own clothes before going home. Going further in from here, we reached the washroom, which had three flushing "shower heads," twelve washbasins, towels, toothbrushes, and mouthwash cups. The washing area was a mound made of cement, perfectly suited to the height of the children when they leaned on it to wash their faces. The children washed their faces themselves, with the nannies only standing by to supervise.</p>
<p>"The children's washing and bathing are assisted by nannies, right?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Of course. Even when washing their faces, some children still don't wash them clean. But I hope to cultivate a sense of independence in them. Bathing was originally scheduled once a day, but later some of the children's families requested that it be extended a bit in this cold weather, changing it to once every three days. Look, isn't there a large stove over there?" She pointed to a stove over there and looked at me.</p>
<p>After visiting the bathroom for a while, we turned to the children's nap room upstairs. This room was formed by connecting three front rooms, and outside was the Municipal Zoo. From the glass window on this side, we could see many exotic animals in the zoo. The air in the room was as fresh and abundant as in a park. There were thirty small iron beds neatly arranged here, with a quilt and a pillow on each bed, covered with snow-white sheets, arranged as cleanly as a ward in a top-notch hospital. Next to the bedroom was the playroom, which occupied two rooms on the floor. The room had children's swings, seesaws, rocking horses, and bicycles, displayed like a toy store. In addition, there were three cages of canaries chirping, making every child look at them and smile. At the east end of the playroom, there were twenty-four tables and chairs, neatly arranged in two rows, like a small-scale meeting place. When the children got tired of playing, they would sit here to rest, and some children were still talking here. They suddenly saw me, a stranger, walk in, and they all stopped talking at the same time, revealing a pair of round, small eyes looking at me.</p>
<p>"How old are the oldest of these children?" I turned and asked her.</p>
<p>"Four years old! Those sitting here are only a little over two years old." She pointed to the children and said.</p>
<p>The children's eyes flickered and looked at each other again, as if they already knew that we were talking about them.</p>
<p>Walking down from the playroom was the dining room. Here were the same twenty chairs as upstairs. On the other side, there were also two large tables, and the bowls and many eating utensils were all neatly arranged in two large cabinets as tall as the floorboards. During meal times, the staff and children ate at the same time; however, the children had snacks in the morning and evening, but the staff did not. Next to the dining room, there was also a clinic and an isolation room. If the children had common minor ailments, they could go to the clinic for treatment. There were as many Western medicines as in a hospital, as well as an operating bed and a scale. The children's bodies were examined twice a month, and their weight was checked once a week. If a child with an infectious disease was found, they would be sent to the isolation room for a doctor to diagnose, and the family members would be notified to take the child back. The nursery could also introduce reliable doctors to treat them.</p>
<p>The doctor hired by the nursery was German, and he came to the nursery twice a week, but if a child suddenly fell ill, he could be notified to come on a temporary basis.</p>
<p>I had seen all the equipment and conditions. At that time, I only had one feeling, and I also said to Ms. Zhu, who had warmly welcomed me for the visit:</p>
<p>"It is indeed a pity that nurseries like this are not yet widely established in China!"</p>

<p>— Yongnian</p>
<p>In Shanghai, whether you're renting a house or meeting a new friend, people either ask, "Where are you getting rich?" or "What business does your husband do?" These are both ways of asking what your profession is. To describe professional activity as "getting rich" or "doing business" is consistent with the meaning of professional activity in today's society. Because in today's society, those who engage in professional activity are merely doing so for their personal lives. So, the question "What business do you do?" naturally expresses the nature of profession in today's society, and the question "Where are you getting rich?" also indicates where you are making money to support your life, highlighting the fundamental characteristics of profession in today's society. Thus, we can generally say that profession refers to the means and methods by which individuals maintain their lives.</p>
<p>Under this definition of profession, we can say that there are no unemployed people in society. Because being an official, soldier, businessman, teacher, selling articles, working in a factory, or farming in the countryside are certainly professions, but selling herbal medicine on the street, performing tricks, telling fortunes, and even being prostitutes or beggars also fit the definition of using specific means and methods to sustain one's personal life. Doesn't this mean everyone is employed and everyone has a profession?</p>
<p>We won't discuss other matters, but now, based on this definition of profession, let's talk about how marriage is also a profession for women in today's society.</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, many women have been liberated from their families and allowed to find work in society, which is called women having occupational freedom. Indeed, in the past, women could not work in industrial institutions, government agencies, or any public institutions, but what about women today? They can be factory workers, shop assistants, teachers, nurses, lawyers, and they can also be clerks, committee members, and even ambassadors, consuls, ministers, etc., in public institutions. If we expand the scope according to the definition of profession mentioned above, then prostitutes who openly display their signs and are protected by law are also professionals. We should not exclude them from the number of professionals because they are lowly. We must know that they are forced to adopt the method of "getting rich" or "doing business" to maintain their lives!</p>
<p>In China, although women now have considerable opportunities to participate in social professional activities, most are still confined at home without finding a way out, so the opportunities for them to freely choose a profession are still very few. Although rural women can participate in agricultural production activities nearby, they generally do not have an independent economic status and therefore live as subordinates to others. Especially unmarried women, who are simply raised in the families of their parents and brothers, and cannot even talk about independently exchanging the right to live by any means or method. For this reason, most adult unmarried women in China mostly take marriage to men as wives as the only way out, using this as a means and method to maintain their lives. In this way, we can say that marriage is the profession of most women. This is by no means a harsh word; in fact, this is the mentality of most women, and even the social mentality. Old-fashioned unmarried women certainly regard marriage as a lifelong problem to be solved. Once married to a husband, they rely on their husband for life to solve their livelihood problems. Even many modern young women, even if they are intellectuals, have the same mentality. When they reach a certain age, they focus on finding a lover and getting married. Although the solution to the marriage problem is also included, they mostly no longer strive to deepen their own knowledge and talents, always believing that getting married is a final destination. Therefore, among them, they either choose lovers and pay special attention to whether they have property, ability, and profession to maintain her life and ensure the permanent security of her life, or directly hope that getting married can immediately solve the livelihood problem. What is this if not the mentality of taking marriage as a profession? The social psychology is also the same, and everyone believes that women's marriage is the key to solving her problem. A few days ago, I saw a women's magazine that said that women's economy originally included men's economy, so even if women cannot find a profession in society, livelihood problems and even social problems will not occur, because there is no professional problem on them. Doesn't this argument clearly say that women's marrying people as wives is their profession, and the purpose of managing their lives has been achieved?</p>
<p>We are not saying that women should take marriage as a profession and should be satisfied with it, but rather that when women's economy cannot be independent and social professions are not fully open to women in the present society, they and the society will inevitably form the mentality of taking marriage as a profession, becoming their unavoidable hardship.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Love and Age <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>I am not a believer in love above all else. I don't think that love is the primary meaning of life. On the contrary, it is subordinate to the highest meaning of life. However, when it comes to talking about love, I think that there must be great love only under genuine love. Love should not be constrained by any traditional ideas. As long as a man and a woman truly love each other, they can unite without asking for the approval of God or irrelevant people.</p>
<p>But what does age have to do with love? I think the emotion of love is not created out of thin air but is produced under certain existing practical conditions. A truly loving couple, their living interests and their thoughts must not have major contradictions, and their ages must be roughly equal; otherwise, genuine love in them will have nowhere to arise. I dare say that a girl who believes in anarchism will never truly love a timid miser; a young man who is unwilling to degenerate and determined to strive for his future in a hard life will never accompany a modern girl full of snobbish vanity and holding hedonism every day; similarly, it is difficult for me to believe that a young girl will really love a gray-haired old man. I have never believed in the matter of "pure spiritual love" in my life. That is the prejudice of ascetics. I believe that love must be a unity of spirit and flesh. If I am not mistaken, then please think about it, how can a unity of spirit and flesh love happen between a young girl and a gray-haired old man? If it really happens, that is indeed a big strange thing!</p>
<p>Of course, I am not saying that only men and women who are nineteen and a half years old will fall in love. No, what I mean is that only men and women of similar age are more likely to have genuine love. The so-called similarity means not to believe that it is too far away. If a young girl marries an old man of the same age as a planting expert, that is a bitter thing because the age is too dissimilar.</p>
<p>At this point, even if we take a step back and admit that young ladies can fall in love with "vigorous" old men, it must be because she really loves him, loves his knowledge and talent, and thus loves everything about him, that is correct. Otherwise, this love cannot be considered great love but is produced under some base consciousness. To be more specific, if she really loves him when she is held in the arms of her old lover, that is of course very good; on the contrary, if she is thinking about foreign money and what position at that time, and smiling in her heart, quickly thinking about the young and strong car driver or her old lover's young son, and therefore feels joy and pain at the same time in the middle, then it cannot be pleasing!</p>
<p>However, in fact, it is said that the god of love, Venus, has long been the concubine of the god of wealth, Marshal Zhao Gongming, and human love has been dominated and managed by the axe of the god of wealth. Therefore, most of the loves with incompatible ages are forcibly formed under the magic of foreign money and banknotes. The marriages of girls with parents and elders and old men are mostly caused by parents who love other people's money; the loves of "free" young ladies without parents and elders and old and decaying people are mostly produced under the direct drive of money by the parties.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Pierhead Cart <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Han Ying</p>
<p>The so-called "pierhead cart" means pushing a cart to catch up with the pier. Needless to say, the people pushing this kind of cart are farmers, but there are also those who do this as a profession.</p>
<p>Due to the economic decline of rural areas in recent years, the phenomenon of farmers leaving their villages has become increasingly widespread. Some, amidst severe disasters and famines, dress up as refugees and go out to seek food. Others go to the cities to sell their labor at low prices to make a living. In addition, there are some more conservative farmers who, although they still work in the countryside, often find that their harvests are not enough to sustain their families. They are forced to find some side jobs to do in addition to their main occupation.</p>
<p>Pushing a "pierhead cart" is necessary for these farmers as a kind of side job. This kind of work is mostly short-term and temporary, and mostly done during the slack farming season, so it does not hinder farming much. The cities and towns they go to are mostly no more than two hundred li away, usually only a hundred li or so, so they are never more than a day or two's journey from home. Due to this convenience, it is no wonder that farmers rush to do this kind of work, fearing that they will be late.</p>
<p>However, pushing this kind of cart is not an easy task. This cart is a kind of single-wheeled cart that we often see. There is a "trick" to pushing this kind of cart, and you must understand this "trick" in order to move it happily and effortlessly. Sometimes, just using brute force will not work. Therefore, this kind of work cannot be done by farmers who are "not in the know." In an ordinary rural village, even if there are a hundred strong men, there may not be more than ten skilled pierhead cart pushers. There are many farmers who would like to earn some money by pushing pierhead carts, but their abilities limit them. If it were not for this reason, there might be even more people pushing pierhead carts.</p>
<p>In Anqing—what has been said above mostly refers to the situation in Anqing and nearby areas, although this situation is not unique to this area—every year during "late winter" is the most active time for pierhead cart drivers. In the eleventh month of the lunar calendar, farming is generally finished, and farmers can use their surplus labor to exchange for money in the towns and cities. They can travel in groups of three or five to the city of Anqing. They bring their own empty carts, planning to return fully loaded. When they arrive in Anqing, the cart transportation agencies in Anqing will accept them. They can wait in these agencies for their good fortune to arrive.</p>
<p>In Anqing, there are many such cart transportation agencies. Just on "He Street" outside the West Gate, there are more than ten. Farmers from western counties mostly "stay" in the cart transportation agencies outside the West Gate, and most of their business is to go to western counties. The situation in the north and east of the city can be inferred from this, so there is no need to mention it here.</p>
<p>The treatment of these customers by the cart transportation agencies is generally as follows: each customer only needs to provide one sheng of rice, and the agency provides side dishes and accommodation free of charge. The cart transportation agencies "number" them according to their arrival order, and then assign business according to the order of each person's number. Most of the rice is brought from their homes, so even if they cannot find work immediately, they do not have much to spend and can wait quietly.</p>
<p>What benefits do the cart transportation agencies get from providing this convenience to them? The benefits are considerable. The farmers are generally required to give 20% of their income to the cart transportation agency as a commission. If a farmer earns two dollars, forty cents of silver must be taken from his own pocket and given to the cart transportation agency owner. Although the owner provides some side dishes, these dishes are so rough that they are only worth a few copper coins, and it would not matter if they were not recorded in the accounts. In short, the owner gets a considerable benefit.</p>
<p>The wages for pushing a "pierhead cart" are generally calculated based on the weight carried and the distance traveled. Generally, carrying a weight of about two hundred jin to a place about one hundred li away cannot be less than one dollar and fifty cents to two dollars. If wealthy people want to take a cart home for the New Year, they will ask for a few more cents, or at least ask for a few cents for wine money (these carts can be padded with quilts to make seats, which can be leaned on, and are very comfortable to walk on on flat ground). As for tea money, food money, and lodging money along the way, although there are also clear stipulations that they are "all-inclusive" and will not be</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>taken care of, in the end, they are allowed to freeload on them because they are small amounts.</p>
<p>Pushing this kind of "pierhead cart" is mostly very hard work. Although they are old hands at pushing carts and know the "trick," pushing several hundred jin of weight for more than a hundred li a day is not an easy task. Most of these farmers who are good at pushing carts live in the mountains. They are used to walking in the mountains and have been learning to push carts since they were young. Moreover, whether it is a big or small task, they almost always use carts. For them, carrying with a "carrying pole" is not as convenient as pushing with a cart. Except for harvesting rice, when "bundles of rice stalks" must be carried, they usually push rice with a cart, push bricks and tiles with a cart, push cotton with a cart... Not to mention that, they even push manure with a cart. Under such extremely skilled conditions, the hardship of pushing "pierhead carts" should be greatly reduced, but every time I see their panting and the bean-sized beads of sweat on their foreheads, I cannot help but feel a sense of sympathy. Moreover, their income is really meager. They first have to spend a lot of rice waiting for business. After finally waiting for their number to be called, they push for more than two hundred li, which is only about four dollars. The cart transportation agency takes away eighty cents, leaving little for themselves. Moreover, although they only push for more than two hundred li, they have actually walked more than four hundred li, because this is a round trip, not a one-way trip!</p>
<p>Not only that, in Anqing, if there are few people, there is also the danger of being bullied by vagrants. They are already very poor, but there are still those who bully them and try to extort money from them. But in matters concerning them, there are always many people, and they all have a "cart pole" and some "brute force," so they are not easily defeated. In the past, there have been incidents of vagrants provoking them, but in the end, they defeated the invaders and obtained peace.</p>
<p>Interviews with Famous People</p>
<h3 id="e205">Interview with Zhou Leshan <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I met Mr. Zhou Leshan at a banquet hosted by my old classmate Mr. Zhu.</p>
<p>One cold winter evening, in a certain room of Tongxing Building, there were many people, mostly young people. At that time, there was a gentleman who was a little older, with a rectangular face, wearing a leather coat, and looking a bit like a professor, who was talking about the love problems of young people in a corner of the room. Several listeners were nodding and smiling, as if his words were touching the hearts of young people. Through Mr. Zhu's introduction, I learned that this was the writer Mr. Zhou Leshan. At that time, I remembered the scene he described in "A Woman's Confession" of playing in a massage parlor, and I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>After the initial introduction, the impression he gave me was indeed very deep. I only felt that he was a writer who met the ideals of young people, and his stuttering was something I would never forget.</p>
<p>Last week, the No. 10 public bus took me to Jiaozhou Road. With a hopeful heart, I walked into Yuan Yang Village.</p>
<p>"Ding...ding..." I pressed the doorbell.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" A child's voice.</p>
<p>"It's me."</p>
<p>A face of eleven or twelve years old looked out from the gap in the iron gate.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Zhou at home?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Opening the stern iron gate, I walked into a small bourgeois-style living room.</p>
<p>"Dad, someone has come to see you," the little brother shouted at the foot of the escalator.</p>
<p>Two small bourgeois met. After we greeted each other, he offered me a cigarette, and the maid poured tea.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Zhou writing?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, where did so many materials come from? I was just reading a book on 'Vitalism'."</p>
<p>"Oh, the author of this book is really a clever person. He came to our school last year to give a lecture. I remember the topic was 'A Scientific Analysis of Propriety, Justice, Integrity, and Shame.' At that time, none of the more than two thousand students in the entire auditorium were not listening with great interest."</p>
<p>"He is indeed knowledgeable, but judging from his book on 'Vitalism,' it seems that he speaks a bit too complex."</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhou, I heard that you are going abroad to study. Is that true?" I changed the topic.</p>
<p>"Yes, I plan to go to Japan. If the circumstances permit, I would also like to take a trip to Nanyang."</p>
<p>Speaking of Nanyang, it reminded me of his recent past article "Scenery of the Southern Country" published in the "Qingguang" column of the Shishi Xinbao.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhou, what was your intention in writing that article 'Scenery of the Southern Country'?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of the intention of writing that humble work, I'm afraid you will laugh. The reason is that I have a great interest in the mysterious Nanyang and often fantasize about it. In order to wish me success in going to Nanyang, I boldly wrote this thing."</p>
<p>"This is not nonsense. When your masterpiece was published in 'Qingguang,' no matter how busy I was, I had to read it every day, otherwise I would feel like something was not finished, because I was also dreaming of traveling to Nanyang."</p>
<p>"You are flattering me too much, making me feel ashamed."</p>
<p>The needle of the self-ringing clock ran around once.</p>
<p>"I have taken up a lot of your time, I am very sorry."</p>
<p>"You're welcome."</p>
<p>Full of joy, I resigned and came out, sitting in the car, still savoring the excitement he gave me.</p>

<p>Biographies of Famous People</p>
<h3 id="e207">Biography of Einstein (4) <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— From Wood</p>
<p>In Einstein's three main papers of 1905—the one on the quantum theory of the photoelectric effect, the one on the molecular theory of Brownian motion, and the one on the special theory of relativity in electrodynamics—the one on quantum theory went beyond Planck's concept of energy quanta, which was introduced in 1900 in the theory of thermal radiation, and only treated as a special hypothesis in the phenomenon of thermal radiation. It expanded the generally recognized range to light emission phenomena and photoelectric phenomena. In 1907, it unexpectedly developed in the theory of specific heat, explaining that the specific heat of solids at low temperatures does not follow the Dulong–Petit law. His thoroughgoing discontinuity theory gave a sense of innovation to physics at that time.</p>
<p>There is no need to comment here that the paper on Brownian motion had already resonated with Smoluchowski's 1906 paper.</p>
<p>In Einstein's 1905 paper on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, the famous space-time transformation formula was published by Lorentz as early as May 1904 in the journal of the Amsterdam Academy of Sciences, in a paper with the same title. Originally, Einstein lived in a remote place and had not heard of Lorentz's paper, so his discovery can of course be said to be an independent discovery. However, the priority of this discovery is with Lorentz, so later this transformation formula was called the Lorentz transformation formula. However, Lorentz arbitrarily and expediently introduced this transformation formula in the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Einstein, on the other hand, saw it from a fundamental examination of the so-called "relativity of simultaneity," and therefore his paper contained important principles in addition to the results of the so-called transformation formula.</p>
<p>If we want to briefly describe the situation in the academic community regarding this issue before and after the publication of Einstein's paper, then this period should be called the era of "reinforcement work" on Lorentz's electron theory. Lorentz's electron theory appeared after Maxwell's electromagnetic theory. Regarding the discovery of the properties of electron-like electrical atoms, there was also its prehistory in electrical decomposition, cathode rays, electrical conduction theory, and optical dispersion theory. Lorentz's electron theory of this theory was disseminated in 1895, and it immediately received brilliant support in 1897 due to the discovery of the Zeeman effect. Secondly, the discovery of the need gave significant evidence in showing the reality of electrons. Therefore, the view that matter is only composed of positive and negative electricity gradually became powerful.</p>
<p>Lorentz's electron theory was based on the so-called absolutely forbidden ether, and solved various difficult problems in the electrodynamics of moving systems. However, if the ether is absolutely stationary and does not move with the movement of objects, then the principle of action and reaction, which is one of the fundamental principles of Newtonian mechanics, cannot be established between the object and the ether. It also contradicts the Michelson-Morley experiment (discovering the relative motion of the ether and the Earth) and does not conform to the mechanical principle of relativity. If we want to explain this issue in a little more detail, then the mechanical principle of relativity is based on the mechanics of Galileo and Newton, and the overall movement of an object system cannot be measured in internal mechanical experiments. However, if we imagine the so-called absolutely forbidden ether as Lorentz did, then that kind of movement can be measured optically. In this sense, Michelson and Morley carried out their experiment, but the result was negative, that is, we must admit that the same mechanical principle of relativity can be established optically. Therefore, in the 1895 paper, Lorentz also put forward the famous Lorentz contraction hypothesis, saying that everything moving in space, that is, in the ether, must be sensitive to this contraction, so that its uniform motion cannot be detected optically, thus avoiding the conflict with the Michelson-Morley experiment. He believed that everything from the smallness of electrons to the greatness of the Earth is subject to this contraction.</p>
<p>Einstein's 1905 paper said that the principle of relativity is also established in electrodynamics, taking the transformation of time and space in stationary and moving systems as the basis and postulate, and deductively deduced the Lorentz contraction theory.</p>
<p>Lorentz did not thoroughly investigate the relativity of time (simultaneity) as Einstein did, but Lorentz and Einstein gave the same results for the relationship between the mass and velocity of electrons.</p>
<p>However, in 1902 and 1903, Abraham, in his paper "The Mechanics of Electrons," believed that electrons are naturally constituted units, are rigid bodies that cannot be contracted, and opposed the Lorentz contraction theory. Consequently, he also questioned the correctness of the Michelson-Morley experiment. In the end, he did not follow the mechanical principle of relativity, but based on Lorentz's initial absolutism, and under the investigation that the emotions of matter are only entirely of electromagnetic origin, the result of the calculation showed the so-called longitudinal mass and transverse mass of the electron, and calculated the relationship with these velocities.</p>
<p>Professor Planck of Berlin considered Einstein's paper to be of great significance and wrote him a letter to express his admiration. Also, at the Berlin Physical Society in March 1906, Planck published a famous paper based on Einstein's paper, which recorded his equations of motion.</p>
<p>At the conference of physical scientists and medical scientists held in Stuttgart in September 1906, Planck, based on the above-mentioned equations of motion, published a paper calculating the results of Kaufmann's experiment. The result of the recalculation still leaned towards Abraham's theory. However, Planck was not satisfied with this. He wanted to obtain theoretical superiority in the method of Lorentz and Einstein and hoped for further experiments.</p>
<p>After this, a debate ensued between Planck, Kaufmann, Abraham, and others. Kaufmann said that Einstein's theory of relativity is only a theory of relativity for uniformly moving bodies, not an epistemologically thorough theory of relativity. Jun Machfield jokingly said that people over the age of forty maintain the mechanical theory of relativity, while people under the age of forty support the electrical theory of absolutism, and that he himself belongs to the latter. This made the entire audience laugh...</p>
<p>At the German Science and Medicine Conference in Dresden in September 1907, only Jun Machfield raised a question in a small report about Einstein's paper denying signals exceeding the speed of light. Other than that, there was no discussion about the theory of relativity and absolutism. However, in this year, Einstein published a comprehensive report on the theory of relativity in the German "Annual Report of Radiology and Electronics," and in its final chapter, he proposed a part of the discussion on expanding the theory of relativity to uniformly accelerated motion.</p>
<p>By the time of the German Science and Medicine Conference in September 1908, the situation was the exact opposite of the previous two years, and the theory of relativity had achieved absolute victory.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Why did 𡝰娜 Come Back? <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— First</p>
<p>"Where did 𡝰娜 go?"—When the second sister came back, these seven words were written on the desk, lying sloppily on half a crumpled piece of paper, looking very dejected, and with such a question mark: like a round, wide-open eye, with a large tear just about to fall from the eye.</p>
<p>The second sisters pretended not to notice, still playfully joking. But Lan couldn't help but scold. The second sister also frowned and said: Why blame her for no reason; she cannot tolerate anyone adding insult to injury.</p>
<p>In fact, the second sister certainly forgave Lan in her heart. She was certainly right, she loved her eldest sister. Indeed, how gentle and amiable the eldest sister was! Who wouldn't want a lovely person to enjoy happiness in this world? Lan only knew to worry about her! The suffering that would immediately befall her.</p>
<p>The second sister loved the eldest sister even more. Only the second sister, who had endured all the torments of the world, could understand the pain deep in the eldest sister's heart, could deeply sympathize with it. Lan thought: The eldest sister's husband loves her, she should leave home—a home with a son, a daughter, and loving bliss. But Lan didn't know: The eldest sister only received her husband's love, the family's love, because she was docilely obedient. If she were not docilely obedient to him, he would not love her either. She thought: Is a woman's meaning in life only to be loved by her husband? Even teaching children, handling household affairs, and his unfaithfulness in love—having relationships with other women—must all be listened to one by one, bending to the will of the husband; isn't a woman just a machine? She didn't want to be a machine. She said to the second sister; she wanted to properly be a "person," living a "human life."</p>
<p>But Lan would not know that the eldest sister had so many unspeakable grievances. She only thought that after leaving the family; she would shed tears because she missed her children; she would feel lonely and sad; and she would live a long dissolute life, how painful a wandering life is—like the second sister, how lonely! How pitiful!</p>
<p>In fact, the eldest sister never felt that the third sister was lonely or in pain. On the contrary, she greatly envied the second sister's freedom! Therefore, time finally gave her this courage; she resolutely wanted to escape that prison-like family.</p>
<p>She only told the second sister her decision to leave. After the second sister raised many objections and issues of pros and cons, and discussed them with her, she knew that her determination this time was not an impulsive decision. She agreed with her "properly being a 'person' and living a 'human' life." So she no longer used negative language to dissuade her, losing her courage.</p>
<p>They quietly prepared, without telling Lan; on the 4:15 pm express train, she sent her eldest sister out of Shanghai.</p>
<p>When she came back, Lan scolded her for doing such a rash thing. The eldest sister's husband even more fiercely hated her, asking her for his wife. She only pretended that it was none of her business, that she didn't know anything, and they couldn't find her. What she was planning in her heart was only how to find work for her eldest sister; how to write letters to comfort her and encourage her. —What can be done? Women have to struggle, to properly be "people," to live independently, suffering, they must endure love. Whether spiritually or physically, they must endure immeasurable pain. But the eldest sister and the second sister said: This kind of suffering is suffering for freedom, meaningful, and valuable. The second sister could only use these empty words to encourage her, to comfort her.</p>
<p>Empty talk is ultimately empty talk, would the second sister forget the lessons that reality had taught her? But, she couldn't bear to stop a person in hell, eagerly yearning for the light of a new ideal life; and she couldn't find a reason to stop her from returning to what the eldest sister considered an unbearable place——improper love, and an incompatible life.</p>
<p>"This is bound to happen, let it go with time"—This was the second sister's attitude. But she also knew: There were only a few people who sympathized with the eldest sister and helped her. Society, the masses, who could care about her pain? Unless she bore all the suffering herself, there was no help at all. Then, the eldest sister, as fragile as she was, could not be as strong as the second sister, able to clash head-on with gales and storms!</p>
<p>Therefore, inevitably, the eldest sister finally came back—was brought back by her husband. The secret address was written by the second sister, it could also be said that it was "deceived" out of her by the husband. But the second sister had already understood; whether she was suspected, cursed, or despised, she didn't care. Her heart was as calm as ever. —She had no joyful excitement, nor bitter depression.</p>
<p>It's just that, the second sister no longer often went to the eldest sister's home. She knew that the eldest sister's heart was even more painful, she couldn't bear to touch a woman's heart that didn't want to be numb but couldn't help but be numb!</p>
<p>"Where did 𡝰娜 go!" But 𡝰娜 came back again! Why did 𡝰娜 want to come back? Gales and storms bullied her; open spears and hidden arrows wounded her; the dead end of life threatened her; the etiquette and religious environment oppressed her. The fragile her, injured and damaged, did not possess all the weapons to resist the strong enemy, she inevitably came back!</p>

<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>May Robson also said: "I have been an actor for fifty years, and I now feel as strong as I was fifty years ago, when I first appeared on stage in London. Of course, my view of life is not as serious as it used to be. The maturity of age has pointed out a path of optimism and acceptance, and has cultivated a sense of humor. A person's brain should not decline due to old age. I have seen so many changes in my life. The stage always reflects the myriad things of the world, and the myriad things of the world are always spinning. And I have been able to see the changes in the myriad things of the world on the stage, and I feel that is my luck. But there must be many changes that will continue to unfold before our eyes today and in the future, and I am certainly willing to live and watch. When the war continues, a person will never put down his weapons and run away, unless he is a coward. I will never be a coward. I quietly await the summons of death."</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, Mary Robison first appeared on stage in a small theater in London. At that time, the person writing the program was careless and missed a letter in each word of her name, writing her fragrant name as (May Robson). May Robson simply made a mistake and used that name, all the way to the present. Her arrival in Hollywood was recommended by the late Queen Mother Mary Tramp. After Mary Tramp's death, May Robson became the only old female role in Hollywood. She has already gained fame in "Lady for a Day." Now her new film (Lay by Choice) is also a strong work.</p>
<p>There is a Henrietta Crossman. She first appeared on stage as far back as 1883. After many hardships, she gradually became a famous actress. Climbing the ladder of fame is slow and difficult, but she actually climbed to the highest level. At that time, her hair had already turned from golden yellow to gray, but the audience in New York saw her take the stage and everyone stood up and cheered. She became famous. She was it. When she retired, she had stood on the stage for half a century. She then bought a large house and settled down with her husband. Unexpectedly, the turmoil in the exchange market arose, and the land under Henrietta's feet was completely swept away. Although she had a large house to live in, she had no money to live on. Later, forced by hunger and cold, she had to put on makeup and return to the stage, becoming a widow again. Fox Company, admiring her fame, hired her. She occupies a very important position in (Menacz), but it has been sixty-five years since she first came into the world!</p>
<p>Alison Skipworth is now fifty-five years old, but she has only become popular in recent years. She enjoyed twenty-five years of fame on Broadway in New York. She has a bright singing voice, and has also tried to appear on the screen, but in the silent film era, although she had a natural singing voice, she had no place to use her talents. After the invention of sound films, she jumped to become a singing old female role. She occupies a very important position in singer Bing Crosby's (Here is my heart). The following are some recent talks by Alison.</p>
<p>"Many people ask me, since you already have a lot of money and can live a happy life, why don't you retire? But if I retire and don't do anything, how can I spend my days? Who is willing to sit at home by themselves, just thinking that she is an old woman? Many people worry about age, and their age has not reached old age, but they are already old. That's because they sit in a rocking chair all day long, thinking, thinking, thinking. I remember a friend who, when the New York subway was just being laid, said to himself: "They want to build a subway. I don't know if I will be able to see it built." Now that the subway has been built, it has been several decades, and my friend is still alive and has not died. If he was not afraid of death and came out to do something, then he would have accomplished a lot in these decades.</p>
<p>I like to work. Work can make a person's body strong, and it can also make a person's brain flexible. Age is not calculated by time. Age is related to thought. A person who is sixty years old may be very young, but a person who is twenty years old may already be old. I worry about those people who are always worried about dying of old age. As far as I am concerned, I don't have time to fantasize. My work, my games, have kept me busy enough. I also don't reminisce about the past and grieve. I only know how to think about the future. I want to stand in this place until no one wants me anymore (To be continued)</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e215">Review of "A Lost Lady" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>A Lost Lady - Cathay</p>
<p>It is almost unnecessary to explain that the playwright's outdated view of love under the definition of love and duty, which is beneficial to the existing social system, will not be ignored by anyone who has seen this film. After watching, the story here is like this:</p>
<p>Mary's fiancé died, and she felt completely hopeless, vowing never to speak of love again. Soon, a middle-aged famous lawyer fell in love with her. Although she was confident that there was no love between her and him, she still married him to repay his kindness. Of course, the most important thing was because the lawyer was rich. After the marriage, she and her husband enjoyed themselves to the fullest. The husband made her a new house, and there was also a garden. The couple, whose ages were very different, seemed to be living very peacefully. But she also accidentally met a pilot, and there was a love entanglement, which changed her life, like a calm water surface broken by a stone. On the one hand, she had the responsibility of a wife to her husband, and on the other hand, she was entangled in love. Under this contradictory mood, she felt great pain, which made her drink madly, abuse her body, and finally ask her husband for a divorce. Naturally, this made the lawyer feel the greatest embarrassment. In a very painful mood, he fainted from excessive stimulation. So Mary realized that her responsibility was even greater, and she had to serve her husband day and night, until her husband was critically ill, when she began to sincerely love her husband. (The brochure does not say so)</p>
<p>In such a story, in addition to illustrating the playwright's old-fashioned views, the main thing is to make women submit to their husbands, sacrifice their own love, and sacrifice their own happiness. After Ibsen's Nora walked out of the doll's house and discussed where Nora was going, we unexpectedly saw this film that advises women to return to their families! In the past, some people vigorously advocated the supremacy of love, which was not necessarily progressive at a certain stage, but now it has been hit by the times, but "A Lost Lady" can't even catch up with the supremacy of love.</p>
<p>However, this film, due to the excellent skills of the playwright and director, has deeply imprinted the film's internal content into the hearts of every audience. Very clearly, the playwright deeply depicted Marlene's inner world, giving the audience a deep impression of her. What is even more worthy of praise is the technique of the director Alfred E Green, who not only made the story very simple based on the compactness of the script, but also played the part of the play very competently and happily. The most brilliant thing is Marlene's painful drinking, and the lawyer's sleepless night, leaving early in the morning, all the way to not being able to support himself in court and fainting. These places are very successful. At the same time, we will not ignore the excellent acting skills of Barbara Stanwyck and Frank Morgan, (but Ricardo Cortez did not succeed due to not being suitable for the personality, he could not pretend to be a suave young man at all, although he had very good results in the past, such as City Symphony.) This kind of achievement cannot be done by mediocre actors. However, we recognize that "success" and "good" seem to be different. In other words, the film's expression technique is successful, but based on a certain point of view and our subjective judgment, we cannot say that this is a "good" film.</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Review of "Springtime in My Heart" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Here is My Heart</p>
<p>Radiance of Great Light</p>
<p>Following "She Knew All the Answers," Bing Crosby and Kitty Carlisle are back with "Springtime in My Heart." It's also touted as a showcase for singing.</p>
<p>Here, naturally, given the class nature of their songs and to cater to their audience's tastes, they inevitably fabricate a hollow and luxurious story to contain it. At the same time, there's a real sense that the reality of the luxurious lifestyle that could be sung about, the glory that could be extolled, has become a fleeting dream. Therefore, what's fabricated here also has to be impoverished princesses and fallen nobles, these poor aristocrats, to harmonize with the passionate and melancholic melodies they sing, seeking a good fit and satisfying the mood of the wealthy in their twilight years. It's further self-deprecating in its portrayal of a famous singer who condescends to work as a servant, actually wins the love of a princess, is then abandoned, and finally has to return to her embrace in a jesting performance.</p>
<p>Starting from this premise, the entire performance is supported by an atmosphere of childish pranks and nonsense throughout. From Hao Sen fishing a small fish out of the Atlantic Ocean, the erotic pursuit in front of the elevator, the drunken state of the real servant, the ugly behavior of the fake servant, the perverted sexuality of the maid, the embarrassment of the fallen nobles, to the movements of cats, dogs, and birds, everything is made comical to elicit laughter from the audience with so-called gags. Thus, the producer's goal is achieved amidst the audience's laughter.</p>
<p>Naturally, we shouldn't forget the songs, which are the main part of this film. There are three songs: "It's June in January," "With Every Breath I Take," and "Love is Just Around the Corner." Just like the success of the "gags" in the dialogue and action, the songs are also sung successfully. As for the meaning of so-called success, when understood in the context of the entire film, we cannot give it a higher evaluation.</p>
<p>Director Frank Tuttle forcefully completed this empty story, making it into the shape it should be.</p>
<p>Both lead actors performed well. Kitty Carlisle, in particular, had more inner expression.</p>

<p>In Li Pingqian's film "Human Relations," Gong Jianong plays a construction worker who likes to drink and gamble, which leads to his wife leaving him, his family falling apart, and him going to jail. When he is released after twenty years, he works as a servant in the bank his son owns. However, due to the circumstances, he cannot tell his son that he is his father.</p>
<p>One day, he learns that his son is going to transport a batch of funds to another location, and he also knows that his son will first go to a hotel before departing. He further knows that once he arrives at the hotel, he will inevitably be ambushed by villains. He rushes to the hotel, and indeed, his son's funds are robbed. Therefore, he disregards everything and snatches the funds back and flees. As he escapes out the door, he is shot dead by the police. But no one knows that he sacrificed himself for his son, rather than being a thief. (Question)</p>

<p>— Xuemei</p>
<p>Johnny Ramirez spoke to the judge: "Your Honor, the simple facts of this case have been stated, and therefore I feel that I have an important duty to my client and to the court, which must be stated again. I have discovered that the defendant's car is not insured, but she has repeatedly caused accidents, one after another...". The defendant's lawyer listened and immediately stood up to speak: "I object to this statement. I ask the court to forbid it." The judge, like an echo, immediately declared: "Objection sustained."</p>
<p>Johnny knew he had no other choice but to obey the judge's will. He then continued patiently: "Your Honor, according to the court's will, but there is a second point. At the time of this accident, nine-tenths of the defendant was under the influence of alcohol. In other words, the defendant was indeed excessively drunk and caused the disaster..." The defendant's lawyer heard this and stood up again to speak: "I object to that." But he said it with a smile. "Opposing counsel's statement is completely unfounded and has nothing to do with this case; furthermore, there is now no witness who can testify to the defendant's condition at the time." The judge then declared again: "Objection sustained."</p>
<p>Johnny Ramirez was a little anxious now. He said: "But, Your Honor, I just want to prove..." The judge interrupted him before he could finish speaking, saying: "This court is aware of what counsel intends, but counsel should understand that this court is not some kind of law school. Before coming to court, you should have had adequate preparation for the case..." The judge was relaxed, without a bead of sweat on his brow; the defendant's lawyer was the same. He was well prepared, his hair neatly combed, his beard cleanly shaved. Although they may not necessarily be looking at each other and smiling, they were kindred spirits, looking down on this disheveled, poor lawyer from Sonora, not giving him a chance to speak.</p>
<p>Finally, Johnny could no longer endure it. His strong ethnicity burst forth involuntarily. He said loudly: "Does the court not want to know the truth? Does the court not want to uphold justice? Does the court not know that this poor old man's car was wrecked by a drunken woman, so that his livelihood was destroyed by a spoiled woman? She thinks she has money and doesn't care if she kills someone. But in this court, what is more important? A few specialized legal terms, or the real situation?"</p>
<p>Johnny's words caused everyone in the courtroom to look at each other in dismay, but if Johnny thought he could reason his way through this place, he was wrong. Because the judge had already made a solemn statement. He said: "This court is of course very concerned about the truth, but from the mouth of someone who speaks recklessly, speaks vulgarly, and shows his feelings... um... a lawyer, this court cannot accept it. Therefore, this court must point out that since counsel did not have adequate preparation beforehand, you have committed professional negligence towards your client. This case is dismissed for lack of evidence!"</p>
<p>Everything was over. The judge had already retreated into the chambers. The old farmer stood beside Johnny, anxiously asking: "Johnny, is my car fixed? Did you win the case for me?" At this moment, the black-haired woman quietly walked behind Johnny and touched his arm. Johnny turned his head, frowning as he looked at her. The woman, whose name was Diane Ahern, said: "Perhaps you won't believe it, but I'm willing to help your client and get his car fixed. I understand, even though the judge... Do you think that's alright?..." As she spoke, she smiled sweetly, took out a large roll of banknotes, and reached out to give them to Johnny. Who could resist her smile? He began to smile. He thanked her, saying: "You're so kind..." Before he could finish speaking, her lawyer, Brooke, had already come up and stopped her, saying: "Diane, are you crazy? Giving him money is the same as admitting your responsibility. Aren't you afraid he'll sue you in criminal court?" (To be continued)</p>
