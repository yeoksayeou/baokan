<p>（日內瓦）蘇俄外長李維諾夫今日通知國聯秘書長愛文諾、謂蘇俄已實行對意財政制裁及軍火對銷、是則蘇俄已爲實施國聯財政制裁之第一國、（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）現有八國政府、卽英·法·波蘭·希臘·古巴·芬蘭·哥倫比亞·拉特維亞·照會國聯、謂已從事取銷對阿國軍火輸出之禁令、蓋遵國聯决議案而出此也、巴黎晚報載開羅電稱、自取銷對阿軍火輸出禁令後、第一批輸阿之軍火、乃由一英船載運、已於今晨駛過蘇彝士運河、第二英船聞將接踵而至、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>英屬索馬里巴巴拉　此間航業中人今日聲稱、子彈七百萬發已在此間起卸上岸、其中多數係比國製造、現正運交南路阿軍、此項軍火將使阿軍領袖能以滴當之武器供給數千援軍、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間接阿京電、阿比西尼亞政府已訂購比利時步槍十萬支及軍火無數云、（十八日國民電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）賴伐爾總理今晨先後接見英國駐法大使克拉克及意國駐法大使賽呂蒂、各會談約一小時、據本社訪員所知、意國政府向阿國擴展問題尙未提出最後要求、此外法國政府已向英國大使表示，願依照國聯會盟約第十六條第三項規定、互相援助、但英法兩國內閣、關於法國援助英國辦法、尙未成立協定、賴伐爾總理當於本日午後賡續與英國大使克拉克會談云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國近向法國探詢、如地中海英艦隊爲意所攻、法國將否起助英國、豫料法內閣開會討論此事後、其覆文將於星期一日發出、，衆信法政府將允助英斕、據官塲聲稱、英國從未與法總理賴伐爾或他人提及對意軍事制裁問題，英國且無封閉蘇彝士運河實行對意封鎖之意、英國唯欲與他國合作、履行其國聯全部義務、但非出於集體行動、英國不願獨負艱鉅、</p>
<p>全國現正殷切竚待下院於下星期二日重行開會時外相霍爾關於國際現局之宣言、衆意今宜明白宣布一切、俾消釋意國報紙及法國一部分報紙故意造成之誤會、巴黎所傳出及他處法國訪員所傳出之消息輒求引起一種印象、以爲日內瓦今所取之一切集體步驟、全由英國代表團發起、英國之政策、志在使意國於作戰與屈服二者之中擇一行之云、每日電報今日評論賴伐爾最近拉攏意國與國聯相接近之努力遭遇失敗一事、謂實則非俟意國停止戰事、談判之其礎不能存立、該報又涉及法總理所稱如英國撤退地中海艦隊之一部分、則其調人之地位可更安穩一節、謂當此意國報紙無一日不作煽惑人心之新議論以仇英國之際、英國碍難出此、今唯望賴伐期切實答覆英國關於相互合作之探問、此實可爲大局安固之保障云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間消息靈通方面預測、內閣將通告全國人民、謂對竟軍事制裁雖未予考慮、但不能担保實施經濟制裁不致引起戰爭、此間咸信星期四國會召開特別會議後、下院將一致援助內閣擁護國聯之政策云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）中國大使郭泰祺今日由日內瓦回抵倫敦、其夫人未同行、擬與友人留居日內瓦數星期郭使語路透訪員、謂日內瓦人士甚以對意之制裁引起戰爭為懼、郭使以國聯此次申責意國之舉與四年前處置滿案相比較、謂渠意雖者國聯寬容日本、實直接鼓勵墨索里尼今日之行爲、中國人民今全渴望對意制裁能發生實效蓋國聯生存唯一之希望實繫於此譽也、郭使對於一般人所抱制裁之結果、或將使墨索里尼傾覆、意國發生内亂共產主義乘時而起之意見、表示同情、（十八日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今晚此間外交情勢極為混沌、一則因此盛傳英國駐意大使德魯蒙向內閣報告、謂意相墨索里尼知英國已準備一切、必欲使意國屈服、撤退其在阿國之軍隊、故現已决定先發制人、立與英國開始武裝衝突云、此項消息、殊足駭人聽聞、因其性質十分嚴重、官方自不至加以徵實、然有足注意者、卽官方對於此說竟亦不願加以否認、意者英國大使送致内閣之報告、措辭或不若傳說之甚、僅述墨索里尼對於前途局勢、態度認眞、特請內閣加以注意、則亦未可知也、又有另一傳說、雖亦未經徵實、但較爲可信、卽謂墨索里尼同時施展其一切努力、以求在各方面加緊法意兩國之聯繫、近日各報登載消息、謂意國政府向法國要求共同保障勃倫納要隘之安全、此項要求雖屬局部性質、然羅馬方面希望與巴黎成立史較普遍之共同保障、則於此可見其一端、總之、目前時局轉變之重要關鍵、則在於法國致英國之答覆、按昨晚英國大使克拉克訪問法國總理兼外長賴伐爾、其所提出之主要問題、卽法國能否約定實施國聯會盟約第十六條之全部規定、而與地中海英國海軍以援助、對於此一問題、賴伐爾表示須俟下期一日方可答覆、一般人相信、法國所以必須緩日再行答覆、實因法國主張意國徹退意屬里比亞軍隊、同時英國亦撤回現駐直布羅陀港之「霍特號」與「雷囊號」兩大巡洋艦、而以法國保證、遇意國實行侵略時、立卽援助英國爲交換條件、此種辦法自必先與意國談判後、方可向英國提出、法國所以須延緩三四日答覆、其故當在於此云、（十七日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日自可靠方面得悉、英已向法提出事實上等於哀的美敦書之照會、要求法國在地中海與英合作、否則將在大陸上喪失英國之援助、英國官員對於此說不置可否、惟稱此項消息代表英政府之意見云、法外長賴伐爾允於星期一復英、可靠方面今日宣稱、法國業已通知國聯、卽行實施對意制裁云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）英意兩國將以地中海爲戰塲而發生公開衝突之危機較前益形嚴重、此間對於英國拒絕撤退地中海本國艦隊一點、觀察觀者一致認係表示英國之認眞、其目的如下、（一）舉行一種示威、强迫意相墨索里尼緩和其政策、（二）如墨索里尼决定拒絕終止阿比西尼亞之戰事、則準備行動、英國對法之態度亦爲事態中之一、大要點、倫敦表示英國對於賴伐爾之兩面政策、已至忍無可忍之境地、美聯社記者自可靠方面得悉、英國已將事實上等於哀的美敦書之照會、送交法國、內容謂法國如無意與英合作、則英將親德云、但此間專家宣稱、如英法合作、則墨索里尼唯有兩途可擇、一卽知雖而退、一則不顧利害力戰到底云英國方面今日聲稱、賴伐爾如拒絕英國借用爾中海之法國軍港、則英國步武希特退出國聯、僅係時日問題云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯會人士目下最所關心者、乃非會員國即美日德三國對於意阿爭端之態度、日本某要人宣稱、「日本現有兩種目標一乃加緊「滿洲國」之發展、俾日本貨物獲得相當銷路、二乃在事實上與中國成立持久之協定、至日本與蘇俄關係、自最近兩年以來、日益緊張、邊境上雖未發生重大事故、但吾人已不能忽視亞洲局勢、而爲歐洲作聲援、或向歐洲方面活動」、若以德國而論、該國多數觀察家刻正注視時局發展、密爲英國政策作後盾、此在英國人士亦已倡言不諱、關於奧國內閣改組一事、德國某要人頃向本社記者宣稱、「現已無人指責德國干預外國內政」、美國人士解釋該國態度云、「歐洲各國如眞欲懲罰侵略國、使之知難而退、則美國之功、實不在小、美國一方面對於意國侵略行爲表示憤懣、一方面仍欲嚴守中立國矣、但戰時中立法、若果嚴格加以解釋、實不利於侵略國、羅斯福總統日前所發表之宣言、雖謂制裁問題與美國無干、但美國人民若與交戰國交易、則政府不能加以保護、因而美國人民如因國聯會施行制裁手叚而遭受損失、則當自行担負責任」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會員國家將於本星期六致函美德日及巴西等非會員國家、將國聯所取對意制裁之辦法及將來擬取之方針、通知各該國政府、以冀此等國家共襄大舉、該項通知書將要求各該國政府書面答覆、並悉爲預防此等國家不合作起見、英國已先事非正式徵求意見、茲已向國聯秘書保證、四國合作甚有希望云、（十八日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）謠傳意相墨索里尼與愛立特利意軍司令發生意見最初無人置信、惟今日則因阿國政府所發表之公報、曾詳述墨氏不滿之意、以致此項謠傳益有力量、據每日電報阿京通信員電告阿政府公報云、「阿國政府得悉、墨氏與愛立特利之司令部人員已發生重大之意見、」據稱墨氏對於阿杜華方面之進行遲緩非常不悅、因如此延宕、已使意軍聲勢大减、墨氏對於狄波諾將軍更大加遣責、聲稱、將另易他人爲該路司令、狄波諾將軍因此曾提出辭呈、聲稱因地理上之困難、且軍中疾病流行、糧食水料皆感缺乏、而阿軍復勇於抵抗、故意軍銳氣早已被挫云、據悉狄氏提出辭呈之後、意方內部之爭業已消滅、（十八日國民電）</p>

<p>— 宜</p>
<p>自意阿戰爭發動以來。英政府在外交方面。力主對意嚴厲制裁。已於極短時間以內。使國聯先後通過關于經濟制裁之三項具體方案。在軍事方面。則將海軍主力集中於地中海。以備應變。據近日消息。英軍事當局又復增調戰艦五艘。驅逐艦十艘開入地中海。於十五日晚。舉行示威性質之海軍會操。同時徵調西印度羣島英艦返歐助防。法總理賴伐爾近雖力勸英國當局。减少地中海方面兵力。以謀戰爭危機之緩和。而英政府卒未聽從。英半官發言人日來公然表示。英國爲事勢所迫。或將封銷意國海岸。蘇彝士運河。及紅海各海口。亦未可知。而昨日倫敦電訊。且有墨索里尼决定先發制人。立與英國開。始武裝衝突之可　的傳說。歐戰以後。地中海風雲之險惡。殆無過於今日矣。</p>
<p>夫法西斯意大利近年來日趨膨脹之軍力。固英國所扶植者。其對阿比西尼亞之貪欲。固亦英國所誘致者。蓋英原欲籍意之力以抑法德也。今者意大利向阿實際下手。英國竟轉而與意反目矣。推原其故。實以墨索里尼東征一旦成功。足使龐大而散漫之英帝國。在其聯絡遠東之主要航綫。受嚴重之威脅也。請就此項意義。　論地中一上兩國之軍事形勢。</p>
<p>先言地勢。英國欲維護經蘇彝士之航綫。非保持其控制地中海之軍事形勢不可。地中海東西門戶賽特港及直布羅陀。均在英國掌握。設有要塞。中部馬爾太島。央亦建有軍港。常駐巨額海軍。以上三地實已構成强固之軍事聯絡綫。此外央尤注意蘇彝士運河之保衛力。在塞浦洛斯島建有法馬干太軍港。與賽特港及巴力斯坦之耶法港。形成三角防綫。今日英帝國支配地中海之布局。大致如此。但在意國方面。自一九一二年佔領利比亞後。築軍港於脫立坡黎。在地中海南岸已獲有軍事根據地。小亞細亞對岸之多特干尼斯羣島。亦係一九一二年爲意所佔領者。意國近年在其羅得斯。利洛斯兩島所築軍港。不僅使土耳其南部海岸感受威脅。抑且使地中海東部之英海軍不得不加意　戒。蓋駐紮兩島之意海軍。固可隨時向英海軍三角防綫施行襲擊也。</p>
<p>次言實力。近年世界空軍戰術之進步。足使海軍减少其威力。固軍事家所公認者意。國今日龐大之空軍。頗有震撼馬爾太及直布羅陀兩要塞之可能性。即英軍事專家思脫拉波爾基。亦不諱言。茲姑置空軍不論。僅就兩國海軍實力之。比較言之據八月間倫敦每日電聞報所載英海軍專家徘瓦特之論文。意國新造巡艦及現有潛艇。均視英爲精銳。而建造中之無畏艦。且在全世界可稱最大者。但意海軍改造計劃尙未完成。而曾受嚴格訓練之海軍不過八萬五千。是否有控制英國東方航路之能力。尙屬難言。再據英海軍當局之調查。地中海意國戰艦。有總排水量二八四七三四噸。而英帝國地中海常備艦隊之總排水量。不過二〇〇〇〇〇噸。地中海一旦有事。英國方面雖尙可徵調其本部及遠東艦隊。但就上述形勢以觀。要非與法切實合作。則英國單獨之實力恐尙難壓倒意大利也。</p>
<p>總之。今日英國在地中海之地位遠非往昔可比。一九二三年墨索里尼與希臘發生邊界糾紛。圖佔柯夫島時。尙對英國之干涉。有所忌憚。今則地中海上形勢如此。且意大利已以二三十萬大軍。帶同無數飛機坦克及一切軍需品。開入阿國邊境。所耗軍費在二萬萬里拉以上。於此法西斯精神一發難收之際。欲謀英意衝突之和平解决。當然遠不若一九二三年事件之易易矣。</p>

<h3 id="c88">山東懸案之一　靑島國武農塲　經市政府交涉收回　農田一萬五千餘畝 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>靑島通訊、本市日人經營之國武農塲、爲山東懸案細目協定中之一項、前經歷任常局交涉、卒以日人索價過高、迄未解决、但此同題雖小、係於我國土地行政之完整、綦爲重大、現經市當局派員迭次交涉、結果以八萬一千元之代價、將該項農田完全收回、茲將詳情誌次、</p>
<p>國武農塲之由來</p>
<p>民國三年、日人佔領靑島後、日本國內人民爭來島上、或經商、或業農、當時有日人某、藉日本官府之勢力、在市外李村滄口一帶、以最低代價、向民間强迫收買土地、每畝代價數十元不等、收買後、仍租於原地主耕種、按年收租、後日人某、又將此項農田、轉賣於國武農塲會社、此爲國武農塲之所由來、總計由該農塲先後收買之農田、約一五八七三畝有奇、迨民國十一年十二月、我國將靑島正式收回關於國武農塲一節、並訂於山東懸案細目協定中、其附伴第四項中、訂有「中國政府將以公正之補償」收回德國舊租借地日本人經營之國武農縐及其他之大農塲」、此外並註明「關於前項收回細目由　澳商埠局與日本領軍官協定之」</p>
<p>交涉收回之經過</p>
<p>我國旣將靑島收回、而國武農塲關係於我國土地行政問題、交涉自不可緩、但日人最初索價、竟達一千零四十萬元之運、市當局以其索價過昻、無法進行、故經歷任當局交涉、屢歸停頓、迄無結果現任市長沈鴻烈、近派市府第　科大長謝祖元、興日領事迭次交涉、經十一年久、始於今春將此懸案完全解决、由我方備價八萬一千元、將該縐農田全部收回、沈以謝科長辦理此案有功、特製金質紀念獎章贈之、以酬其勞、</p>
<p>收回後分等放租</p>
<p>市府將此項農田收回後、卽由財政局規定分爲三等、仍由原地主領租、上等每畝二百元中等每畝百五十畝、下等每畝一百元、全部放出後、可得租洋三十萬元、惟聞各地主以日人收買時、僅予以數十元之代價、此次財政局放領最低價額、亦須百元之多、故多存觀望之心、不肯領租、最近並擬聯合向市當局請願、請求將價格减低、以資體恤、</p>

<p>夢境是極甜蜜的，同時也是極酸苦的；有時會夢見生平未遇見過的甜蜜，但有時也會夢見生平未遭逢過的酸苦。</p>
<p>你說人家在做夢，人家也說你在做夢，不必他說你，你說他，「大家俱是夢中人」。</p>

<p>— 特</p>
<p>葡國查城鎭中常有一個乞丐出沒其間，他的雙目業已失明，他的臉兒，已被人熟識，據他自己說，他腰無分文，活着受苦，現在他忽然被控假裝瞎子騙錢，捉到官府裏去了·原來他雙目炯炯，却故意裝做瞎子，乞憐於人，辛苦了半世，積存英金萬鎊，至於被人發覺的原故，說來也很奇怪，葡國海濱有一個名穆爾的小鎭，風景絕佳，極合爲避暑的勝地，却因爲鎭中沒有旅館，所以遊客都裹足不前，地方官本打算興造，苦於經費不足，便把這事擱起了，那乞丐本生在該鎭，一日他突然拜會地方官，願助五千金鎊，把那旅館造成，使冷落的穆爾鎭，變成繁榮的遊息所，並且願意担任親自督工，地方官聽了這番話，不禁發笑，以爲這乞丐有神經病，便露譏刺的口吻，頓時激怒了這位來賓，便從懷中摸出支票簿，表示他的的確確是一個擁有萬鎊的主人翁，同時證明他並不是瞎子，却有精銳的目力，當局很感謝他慷慨解囊的盛意，但同時又不得不把他拘禁，因爲他假裝了三十年的瞎子，騙取人們的金錢，消息傳出之後，全鎭居民，大爲詫異，但因爲這人耐勞耐苦，積蓄了許多金錢，不自己享用，却犧牲在公共事業上，所以都對他表示同情，以爲他或不免判罪，將來由獄中放出來的時候，也許有被選爲市長的希望哩！</p>

<p>— 葉奕顧</p>
<p>爲着到滬西霍必蘭路附近的一個農村小學裏去看一個朋友，所以‘就很遠的從南市出發到了兆豐公園；到了兆豐公園，又沿着白利南路往西走去，漫長吃力地到了霍必蘭路，一問那所小學的地點，又橫過了林肯路前去。路旁樹木成蔭，兩邊農作物已成熟；且走且看，不覺已到了一個門前扎着道縐彩牌的地方，仰面觀之，則寫有××××水陸法會幾個大字；黃布的圈結，點綴在水泥牌樓的前面，門有三個，往裏是一倏長道。在下爲好奇心驅使，就站立而不走了；一問旁邊的水果攤，才知道這就是，永安公墓」；爲着這兒還沒參觀過，就搖擺着身髒踱了進去。心想：這些墳墓裏的死人，幸福倒是超於水災區難民之上。</p>
<p>嘿！不進去倒也罷，一進去後，祇見饅頭形的，方形的，平形的，種種式子的墳墓，不計其數；有大理石的，也有白石的；墓前豎起了石碑，或刻以像，或刻以哀辭，或刻以略歷，富麗堂皇，眞不愧是一個墳墓的都市，墳墓的天堂。大人有，小孩也有。更見許多女人。在一個墓前痛哭，聲調悲哀，深深地打動了我一個小小的心兒。</p>
<p>問守者，知道所謂水陸法會也者，要做七天：經費是有錢人處捐來的；特地到囌波附近一個什麼山，請了八十個和尙來。</p>
<p>我在到朋友學校的那段路上想：水災區域的災民，活活的忍受着饑寒，待人拯救；那知上海的死人，倒有如此的幸福無量。活人不如死人，實在是伴矛盾的事！</p>

<p>可是在這個時候，却鑽出了一個多事的人，要打聽這事的究竟。這就是那位强項令周有容的夫人。他正由潼關外趕了來，陪伴他的丈夫，對於西安城裏的事事物物，他都感到一種興趣。這時，賈太太的事，已經闀動了全旅館，他也就在人叢裏看着熱鬧。及至他們到屋子裏去了，他還不肯罷休，依然坐在過廳裏一張椅子上，看着他們可有什麼變化。後來許久許久，他們都沒有作聲，周太太倒反是不耐，推開門簾子，伸了半截身體進來問道：咦！你們怎樣不說話呢？再不說話，賈先生回來了，你們又沒有了機會了。老太太和朱胡氏有到一位東方打扮的婦人走了進來，料着是一位闊人太太，全慌裏慌張站起來沒有一個放手脚處。周太太就向他二人搖着手道，不要緊，你們只管坐下，我姓周，是那周縣長的太太，不過看到你們說得可憐，所以來打聽打聽你們的情形，你們打算怎麼辦呢？月　就向他微鞠了個躬，可不知道讓坐略垂了頭道，多謝你關心，我已經把身子賣給人了，還有什麼打算？什麼都只有聽着人家的了。朱老太坐在床沿上，向周太太望着，想開口說話，但是掀起衣襟，揉擦了兩　眼睛，把話打斷了回去。（三四三）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>再說太后所躺的坑，那倒不是怎樣特別的，就是下而襯的軟彬，比普通原一些；冬天要襯三重，春秋是二重，夏天遝得襯一重，這也許是伊年事巳高，比較上怕冷的綠故，軟褥上罩的那條綢毯自然又是　得極精緻的，而且是每隔兩三天就要更換一次的。伊的寢宮內除却夏天之外，平常總得生一個暖爐，祇是冬天生得旺些，春秋生得微弱些而已。到晚上，伊上床之後，無論什麼日子，我們八個女官中總得有一人留在伊的臥榻之旁；而在外面的廊下，也是不論睛雨，無間寒暑，　有一批太監，一動不動地，一聲不發地伺候着。</p>
<p>啊！這種種的情形，雖然在我比刻想來，還像祇是昨天所見到的一樣！所使我懷疑的僅僅是何以像太后那樣一個名聞天下，權傾匹海，掌握着幾萬萬人的生死之權的皇太后，歸根結底，却依舊是一個肉骨凡胎的生人卜伊也得吃東西，穿衣服，跟普通的人一樣；伊也得洗操，—雖然洗法微有不同，但洗的結果還不是同樣的，祇是把身上的汚垢去掉嗎？這種種都足以蹬明伊仍然只是一個女人！</p>
<p>更進一步說：伊的感覺也並不曾異於常人。伊也一般歡喜休息，歡喜洗澡；尤其是在洗澡的時候，當那四名宮女用着極熟練的手法，在伊的潔白的嫩膚上洗擦時，伊顯然楚有相當的快感的。（四三九）</p>
<h3 id="c170">採野栗子 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 王莎葩</p>
<p>綿亘數十里的山岳，舒展着茸茸的茅草，幾枝蒼松很挺秀的聳立聳立山腰邊，白鍊般的瀑布，打從山峯的石隙里潺潺地直瀉到山脚下一隻大池中，清澈見底的碧水，十來尾黑背鬰　，在游來游去的覓食。</p>
<p>在秋的節候里，茅草中間雜了許多綠色刺球的菜實，這就是野栗子，野栗子的粒形雖然比較人工種植的小了數倍，可是吃口格外味甜香糯。大的，眞和天津良鄉栗一樣。在我們小小的鈸落上，四面都是叢山峻嶺，所以野栗子的產生也不少。採取野栗子的人，都是十來歲的村姑，把一個個栗球，小心翼翼的割取了，別讓刺兒刺痛了手指。回到家內一個個用板把刺滾去，剝出一粒粒的野栗，積成了一大筐。再放到鍋內去炒熱了，帶上街來換取銅子，一酒盃，大約三個銅子，給小孩子消閒是很好的。如果買些生的剝了肉，做一碗糯米飯，是別有風味的。</p>
<p>假使我們細細的體味一下，村姑將野栗子換到銅子的手續又多麻煩呢？回想社曾上種種的事情，那一椿能不費點氣力，可以輕鬆鬆的得來呢？所以做人，也應當辛辛苦苦的幹些事業，以後綫有安閒的日子過。</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>很多朋友問我：爲什麼我們把挺大挺活潑的金魚，養在很敞闊的玻璃缸中，沒有多久，就陸續的都會僵去？水，是天天換的，食，給它吃，有時吃盡，有時一味的浮在水面上不停的翕張，換了水好些，不過，歸根結蒂還是一條也不剩。</p>
<p>這，我敢告訴大家，玻璃缸根本不合飬魚，僅能作暫時的供養則可。大凡直徑一尺的玻缸，舀八分光景的水，（水，最好鑲些老綠水，更得。）祗能放寸來長的魚兒三四尾，每天一次，給些紅蟲子它吃，如果居家不易撈取紅蟲，卽飯顆粥粒也成，不過，要摘小了先把膩液冲洗去，也不宜多給，然後就太陽光照射一二小時，一星期換一次水，就能不出毛病，如果缸底魚屎多了難看，也不必急急換水，僅須用「吸水管」把脚抽去便成，至遲十天八天不換水，只要不浮頭，是不要緊的，假使魚大缸小，半天也躭不往，至於換水，無論井水，自來水均可，祇要能在地面上停留一周時後始用，此卽謂之熱水，換熟水對魚身亳無刺激，所以，最好換水要用熟水的。</p>
<p>上面這些話，是從實地試騐過來，可以說是上海寓樓的飬金魚方法，照這樣子養魚，可無他應。</p>
<p>這些日子，秋高氣爽，游漕河涇的人們非常多，尤其星期六同星期日，冠生園農塲就熱鬧得可以，因之金魚買賣，倒很不差，去買的都要三四年的老魚，所以最近又到蘇錫一帶添進了百多條的細種老魚，還有，一種北方出產的絨球魚，前兩個月，有位天津冠生園分店的經理先生到上海來，我就託他回去後物色些大球魚，好了，前幾天快信已來，承他情專派一個魚園做手，帶了三十幾尾花絨球和大紅絨球，搭平滬通車到上海來了，一檢看，嚇，其大無比，那種頭上的絨球，整整有兩顆桂圓那麼大，挺好看，上海是見不到的。不久，我們要舉行一個南北名種的「魚展會」，來請海上各界名流欣賞和品評咧。</p>

<h3 id="c185">目前文化界的一個巨大危機 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 平之</p>
<p>目前我國的文化界，正當着一個巨大的危機。這個危機的到來，旣不是由於出版界的不景氣，也不是因爲一般人心消沉，總說一句，是由於帝國主義國家文化政策的新展開。</p>
<p>我國的出版事業，在所有的產業中，許多年來，可說很少受到帝國主義勢力的壓迫。如其他產業，因外國資本的壓迫與外國商品的傾銷，現在是十九皆朝不保夕，乘着歐戰的機運而興起的民族工業，簡直全陷於破產的境地。然而出版事業，雖以不景氣故，目前的情况，很是蕭條，但對帝國主義的壓迫，可說是超然於其外的，這原因，由於彼此之間，存着完全不同的語言文字的間隔。</p>
<p>因此之故，帝國主義國家對殖民地的文化政策，最初只是傳教，所謂教會者，亦以翻印耶教經典爲事，這與我國思想上的影響，實在很小，繼着由傳教而辦學，然仍不脫教會的支配，影響尙淺，迨美國首先退還庚子賠欵。用於教育及文化專業而成效大著，於是如英法比日等國都起而效之，我國的文化界，遂如割據主義的封建軍閥一樣，因其所受的教育及庚欵根據之不同，亦分成許多派別，這個從傳教到辦學的過程，正當於資本帝國主義之由商品輸出進而爲資本輸出。在商品輸出的階段，其目的是商品的推銷，迨至資本輸出，乃利用資本，投資於殖民地，以購買公債證券，設立工廠等方式，求取利潤，故當帝國主義商品輸出的階段，其所需要的是，商品推銷員與服用西洋文明品物的所謂新人物，而至資本輸出的階段，則更進一步，需要技術上的專門人材，如帝國主義者投資築路，他實不止希望能從鐵路營業上取得利息，還更希望如鐵路材料等等，亦能由彼供給，如鐵路之經營管理，亦能由彼支配，在這裏就需要受其教育的人材了</p>
<p>直到最近爲止，我國的文化界，是在這樣的一個情狀中。但是我們知道，資本帝國主義對殖民地的政策。决不止於資本的輸出，他還要再進而使殖民地為其本國政治經濟以及文化上的隸屬·這是廣大的中國從次殖民地到分裂的殖民地的過程。不幸，我們的運命現在却不得不踏上這過程的第一步！</p>
<p>現在不說政治經濟方面的情形，單就文化界言，我們可明顯的看到，因爲帝國主義勢力的壓迫，我們已不能隨便發言，甚至我們的教科書，我們的歷史，都不能不有所修改，但帝國主義者能就此而止嗎？不能的！像蘇俄那樣，爲了宜傳其主義，赤化我中國，曾經編有中文教科書及其他讀物，並且，也曾出版過不少的中文報紙與雜誌。帝國主義者也必然的要來這一套的。帝國主義的中文報與中文雜誌，現在已經有了，以帝國主義自己的立塲開設書店，來編輯的教科書，當然也不久就會出世的。到了那時。試問我國出版界的資力，能與之競爭嗎？這樣，我們向來超然於帝國主義壓迫以外的出版事業，就必須受其傾銷的打擊，而陷於絕境。</p>
<p>或者說，即其如此，只要我們的知識中人，不與合作，一致抵制，帝國主義雖有雄厚的資本與勢力，有什麼用呢？但我敢問這是可能的事嗎？我們須知中國今日的一般知識分子，正以能親近外人爲榮，而社會一般的心理，亦以能與外人相交接者爲高等。現狀如此，只有帝國主義者之不我用，倘若一且有什麼需要，我恐中國的知識分子，像登龍門，一樣還求之不得呢。</p>
<p>讀者諸君懷欵我的說話嗎？那麼請看當前的事寮。那些朋分庚欵的，不是我國的所謂名流學者嗎？而所謂專家也者，共所研究的報告，不是多用東西文字，而反不屑用自已的中文嗎？還有，現在的所謂學者，雖是中文的著述，不是反送至外國印刷听或外國出版，然後冉由外國書鋪以爲發行嗎？憑藉了帝國主義的勢力，旣可在社會上占有高等的地位，受一般人的崇敬，並且，還可避免本國政府的檢查，而自由發表共詆斥本國的言論，給人稱爲敢言的英雄，這樣的漢奸有誰不願意充仟呢？</p>
<p>事情旣已到了這步田地，這是中國在文化上的消滅，及今不圖，我恐將來眞要後悔莫及了！</p>
<h3 id="c186">一本可讀的書 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 曾建屏</p>
<p>中國中古時期的田賦制度　劉道元著新生命書局印</p>
<p>近幾年來，中國的出版界，雖然因爲社會史的論戰而稍稍注重到中國社會制度本身上的諸問題；可是新近的著乍，對於中國社會的史實能作個別的論述及分析的，究是少數之少數。尤其是關於田賦問題的比較專門的著作，更是少如鳳毛。這種現象，是我在這幾月中才更加了解的。</p>
<p>劉道元先生的「中國中古時期的田賦制度」，雖然不是一本什麼專門的大書，雖然只是以中國中古時期！即向東漢靈帝中平元年黃巾亂起，至唐玄宗天寶十四年安錄反叛爲止這一時期的田賦制度爲其研究的對象；但是他這本書，在其方法論上，在其內容瓷料上的尙不失爲一本可讀的書。</p>
<p>這是什麼原因呢？</p>
<p>第一，是因爲劉道元先生這一本書，其所採用的方法，完全和陳登元等所採用的方法不同。他並不把中國的土地制度或賦稅制度，看成爲一種孤立的現象；相反的，他却是把它們看成爲當時的生產力制約下的社會現象，而且依照這現象內部的階級關係來研究的。他並不以考證的熊度來平鋪過去歷史的事實，而是欲藉他的研究，來「顯示出」當時的「統治者和被統治者在租賦上所有的關係。」</p>
<p>故在方法論上來看，這本書是可讀的。</p>
<p>其次，在社會階級段的分野上，劉先生這本著作，也是有着特殊的見解。即是：他不僅將中世紀這一階段列爲一個特殊的階段，而指出這一階段是莊園自足的生產，是以「國家莊園和大族莊園及寺院莊園鼎峙對立着，國家以軍耕或均田隸屬了其下的農奴，領了土地的大部，在大族及寺院之上建立起有力的王權」爲其特徵；而且更指出這一世紀的賦稅的特色，是完全和一八”四年以前（　兩漢及其以前，）七五五年以後的租稅完全不同·因爲中世紀以前及以後的租稅的負擔者，是商業資本家及大地主；而中世紀則是一般強示巨族及寺院僧侶·田賦制度的變化是當時階級對立關係之一面，劉先生却能從一面來（解决三國至唐的社會階段所屬之謎，「這樣的觀點，是比較一般平鋪史實的所謂學者的意見高出萬萬的。</p>
<p>故從這一點來看，我們也以爲他這一著作，是一本可讀的書。</p>
<p>第三，劉道元先生這本書，對於歷史資料的引用，也是非常之適度及有分寸的。例如將他論「三國土地的二種形態」這一章與陳登元先生或陳伯瀛先生等的著作來比較的時候，我們就可以見出陳登元先生等之運用當時的歷史資料，是怎樣平鋪直序和表面化；而劉著却怎樣能够從當時土地制度之特殊形式入手而分析當時諸種土地佔有形式的相互關係。凡此種種，均是劉著爲其他各書所無的特色。由於這種特色，使幾個人益認爲劉道元先的著作，實爲目前中國土地制度問題日益嚴重的時期中，一般靑年所應該熟讀的書。</p>
<p>不過，據劉先生自己的序言說：這一本小書還是他的中國出賦史綱的第四編。我們爲着他的著作的可讀，更希望他的令書人作的出現。</p>

<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>第五——辦雜誌而擴充開來的書店——辦了一種刋物，覺得生　不錯，讀者也很廣，於是進而辦書店了，如新女性之於聞明，新生命月刋之於新生命，生活週刊之於生活，黎明月刊之於黎明，都是其例。最近，據說中國農村經濟研究會與中國經濟情報社因出版中國農村與經濟情報，得了好評，也振充而成立了新知書店，新生週刊不幸夭折，聞鄒先生回來又在籌劃新生書店，「經濟常識」因新聞報的廣告效力而行銷較廣，隨之也就產生了經濟書店，這此書店，也都可歸併於此類的。</p>
<p>第六——由舊店新擴充的書店——隨着開書店的風氣的推動，有許多舊書店也紛紛擴充起來，舊軀殼中灌注進了新生命。如大東，出一些武術法律等書，不是很好嗎？突然的大收其稿。成立了今日這樣很漂亮的門面。神州國光社的碑帖字畫是很廉錢的，可見突然又來了讀書雜誌，以及什麼蒲列哈諾夫之類的一大批新書，民智書局以出售黨義書籍出名，在楊幼炯先生主持下也出了許多國際政治及法律等新書。世界書局的特徵是紅玫瑰與江湖奇俠，那知突然來了許多ABC，不足，又是大批的大學叢書，中學叢書之類的許許多多的新書。</p>
<p>第七——不，沒有了。並不是沒有了，若再加上去，未免要重複了。如不嫌繁瑣，還可以分的，至少，還可以分出一種「莫名其妙的書店。」在過去不久的現在，大家盲目的爭開電影公司，由莫名其妙的成立，結果也莫名其們的關門。當時也有許多這種的新書店。闊老妙聽了人家的慫恿，拿出幾萬來開一家書店，結，果，沒有好久就倒閉了。再其次，這看新近的事，黨國要人開書店，甚或「半官」性質的書店也發生了。</p>
<p>還有，是的，還有那些「以宣揚文化爲職責的書店」還沒有提到呢！但是，究是那幾家呢？亞門，我們祇能說：所有書店都是的！</p>

<p>書店的資本在實質上和其他各業的資本並沒有一樣，不過在資本的徵集上，因出資人的性質不同，遂也有了分別。依照普通的集資方法，不外乎：一，獨資，二，合夥，及三，公司組織三種，書店也近是。但是你要知道，「開書店」這個賣貿，也許是在「百業」之外，並不是誰都知道做，誰都會做，以及誰都願意做。因此，公開招股，以公司方式來組織的，除了商務，中華等幾家所謂大書店外，委實不多，有之，似乎祇見年前開明書店於報端公開的招了一次股，其他各新書店，雖則也有公司組織的，但公開招股的却不多見，原因非各書店不願招股，而是即招股也不曾有人來應招故。</p>
<p>要知道新書店資本的來源，當先知道新書店須要多少瓷本，如不嫌過大的話，那末，我們可說，少至數十元，多至數百萬，都是一樣。這話怎樣說呢？你不見，祇印簿簿數十頁「本書，而創立一個書店名稱的，不是很多嗎，這樣的書店，不是數十元巳够了嗎？至於數百萬呢？那話固有些過大，但實際上，新書店對於資本的需要，確是無限制的。</p>
<p>新書店最好的應用資本的策略，是把所有瓷本，除開一部份必須的開支外，全用在出版新書上，書店營業的發達，以售書的多少爲定，要書售出的多，非種類多不可，這樣，就使書店對於資本的需要，沒有止境了。因爲，譬如出版一本書，成本是二百元，待書一出版，這二百元是非全付不可的（書店有意使印刷所及者作者「吃倒賬」，自當別論），但書不能立即售完，即使售完，又不一定能收回全部賬欵，於是，出版新書愈多，墊下去的「死資本」也愈多，存貨也愈多，賬底也愈多，一切都「愈多」，而活動資本則愈少了。因此，除了幾家發展到了頂點（？）的大書店以外，新興的書店，尤其是在發展的過程中，隨時隨地在渴求新的資本。今日上海四馬路上各書店沒有一家不感到流動資本的缺乏，這是不能完全　罪於新書業不景氣的，一部份還是由於書店的「資本構成機能」使然。</p>
<p>於是，各書店的資本來源以及取得的方法，不得不出之於下列幾途：</p>
<p>第一，獨資，所謂獨資有好幾種，有的是書店老闆自己經營書店，而自已出資的，這種書店，大半全是市儈書店，規模也不大的。還有是非經營者出資，在過去數年中，頗有此東軍政要人，黨國先進，聽了一般文士的包圍慫恿，拏出幾萬幾十萬，來開一爿書店的，這種書店，在今日已有很多倒閉，但還有一二家，到沒有錢了的時候，由出資者開一張支票，這樣一張一張地在繼續着。以前，有幾家書店，，營業部根本沒有賬目，有一家，經理死了，往來的客賬即無從查起，不知道的人以爲是笑話，如知道了這種書店集資的內幕，自然不足爲奇。</p>
<p>第二，合夥，這種合夥多見之於文人自己所開的書店，幾個寫作的朋友，集合在一起，大家拏出些錢來，書店是成立了，但不知道新書店是不時需要新的資本去滋養的，文人根本沒有這末多的錢，因爲無以爲繼，以致中途夭折的，這種書店眞是太多。</p>
<p>各種有趣的拉資本的方法，也多發生於這種書店中。如侵呑作家稿費，作爲新股，即其一。因爲文人所開的書店，對於著作書大多有些認識，如有人在他們那裏出書，他們便對你說：「你的稿費一半作爲股欵，加入我們的書店吧！」這樣，在名義上是增加了新資本了。其次，於熟人，「老朋友，請你也來加入一股吧」，錢拏到，先付了房租，甚至是先作了拉股者本身這一月的薪金，直到閉門大吉，出資者還不見發來股票的，也是很多。</p>
<p>第三，公司組織，但眞化的依照公司法辦理的，在上海新書店中，很不多見。除了一二家大書店外，有許多新書店，雖宅爲股份公司，事實上不但沒有官紅利，而每年的營業報告也是不見的。</p>
<p>還有一種吸收瓷本的方法，且是一種不很好的方法，即書店吸取存欵。其中佼佼者，當推世界。此外，即如開明，兒童等，也都有同人存欵。銀行存欵，長年利息不過七厘，書店存欵則在八厘至一分之間，在書店方面說，道比向銀行出九厘去透支好些，但在書業一般衰落中，營業結算很難有一分的純利，所以，所謂存欵，實是飮鴆止渴。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c200">正栅負屏三極管用做檢波管 <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>通常三極眞空管，無論是用做振盪，放大，或檢波，眞所用屏壓必爲正，柵壓必爲負，大家都知道是一個負柵正屏的三極管；其輸入電路爲柵路，輸出電路爲屏路，而由柵極主持控制作用。俱是反轉過來，利用屏極爲控制極，將高週率電壓輸入屏極而由柵極輸出，也來售不可見諸實用。</p>
<p>正柵負屏三極管（PositiveGridTube），共構造與尋常三極管無異，所異者卽在共屏柵極之互換作用，其屏極担任尋常三極管柵極的一切工作，而柵極則担任尋常三極管屏極的一切工作。故正柵負屏三極管，也可稱爲倒用眞空管（InvertedVacuumTube），其主要點有三，（一）柵極爲正壓，故可改稱曰正柵極，因其距離絲極較近，故柵流頗大；（二）屏極接負壓，故屏流較小或無屏流，因其主控制作用，故改稱曰控制極（Brakeelectrode，以示有別；（三）屏柵旣互易工作，故由屏路担任輸入，而由柵路担任輸出。</p>
<p>正柵負屏三極管的用途，在振盪方面，則有巴漢生振盪器（BarkhausenOscillator）的發明，以產生十公分至數公尺的超短波；在放大方面，則可用來做降低電壓的器具，因簽入的控制極比輸出的正柵極距離絲極較遠，其作用恰與尋常三極管相反，實際上非放大而爲放小；至檢波方面，非但可用以接收超短波，如設法得當，接收尋常的廣播波帶，其靈敏度亦並不弱。</p>
<p>圖一所示卽爲正柵負屏三極管的綫路接法。絲極F所產生的電子爲正柵極G所吸，一部流入柵路，一部便穿過柵隙而至控制極B附近。如控制極這時的電壓爲正，這一部電子便爲控制極所吸收；如這時的控制極電壓爲負，則這一部電子便爲控制極所拒而折回柵極。如將柵正壓高至飽和數値，則絲極所放射總電流，is已達飽和狀態而不變，於是屏流，ib與柵流，ig的總和必不變，因絲極所放射的總電流卽爲屏流與柵流的總和。是故</p>
<p>ib＋ig＝is＝常數</p>
<p>如示之以圖，則ig－eb特性曲綫必爲ib－eb特性曲綫之倒影，如圖二，如圖二所示；換言之，卽屏流的增加必等於柵流的减小，如柵流增加，屏流必因之而减小一，如將尋常三極管屏檢波的原理應用於此，可將控制極的負壓Eb配値於相當作用點，則輸入於控制極的高週率電壓eq，經整流作用，而使屏流ib按照輸入eb波形而增加，柵流ig便也跟着屏流波形而减小，於是檢波作用便轉達於輸出的柵路了。</p>
<p>（一）超短波檢波應用上述原理，可得檢波綫路如圖三所示，以收超短波。超短波高週率電壓由天綫誘導於配諧電路E以達控制極B，配置Eb負壓以得控制曲綫ib—eb上的相當作用點。於是，藉整流作用，調幅電法便輸送於柵路了；柵流的變化，經荷載電阻Eg的作用而使爲電壓的變化以輸出。爲避免Zg消耗於Zg的直流電壓降過大，故eb不周耗阻，而為總阻（Impedauce），因總阴的電流電壓降甚小，故所用Eg僅須超過飽和値以調幅電流所降低的柵壓已足。</p>
<p>（二）廣播波帶檢波圓三所示僅能應用於當配諧電路E的總阻甚小時；如E的總阻甚大，因ib流經E的總阻，勢必使此管對於eb不靈敏。接收超短波的E電路，其總阻極小，故能如尋常三極管的靈敏。但對廣播波帶的波長，則E電路的總阻已足使圖三不能適用。欲檢波廣播波帶，可將圖三加以改良如圖四所示，並將ib—eb的作用點一配置於P，而同時ig—eb的作用點則當爲q。c爲一〇〇M．M．F．的電容器連接於屏柵之間，以使一部屏流ib經c而行，以减輕E路的荷載。另於柵路內挿入一高週率阻流圖D以阴止高週率電流流入的路，而同時C對於低週率的廻阻亦足可使柵路的整流不能流入屏路，故整流僅流經柵的荷載Zg。據試騐所得結果，這樣的裝置，其靈敏度得比圖三增加四十五倍，並不弱於尋常三極管的檢波云。</p>

<p>— 曹潤生</p>
<p>外差式收音機是收音機中最好的綫路，因爲它有高超選擇性和靈敏度。在電台林立的上海尤能顯出它的特長。外差式原理是簡單的：外來電訊經過檢波器而成爲低週率電流，同時收音機內局部振蕩器發出的高週率電流和它混合成爲介乎高低週率問的中間週率。然後將此中間週率由中問週率變壓器而輸入另一檢波器（卽第二檢波）成爲人耳可聞的低週率電流。外差式收音機中較不易製者爲中週變壓器，此器須適能使一種週率電流能通過，其他週率絕對不可通過，同時使外來電訊和局部振蕩器混合週率永與中週變壓器相同，否則失效·外差式收音機之所以有高超之選擇性者亦</p>
<p>自製收音機中採用外差綫路者極少，大概製者以爲外差式是極難製而不敢嘗試。不過也有許多人單以娛樂爲目的，所以稍爲高深綫路卽不屑領教。其實外差式綫路並不難造的，假使難，那更是我輩業餘研究者所應負的責任了！這裏作者來介紹給諸位一具最簡單的外差式收音機，它有數種特點：（待績）</p>

<p>全國運動大會、已成尾聲、昨爲第九日、男女錦標又解决三項、上海連得棒球、男子排球、及女子籃球三項錦標、男子網球雙打冠軍、亦歸上海、其餘各項錦標、除游泳外、悉將於今日解决、男女總錦標之歸入上海、已爲不可能之事、男女游泳中、昨又有全國新紀錄發現、港馬粵滬昨日之足球複賽、尤爲轟動一時、動衆近十萬人之譜、尙有成千不得其門而入、實開上海運動比賽盛况之新紀錄、今日港粵競奪冠軍、適逢星期六、更必轟動無疑也、</p>

<p>昨日全部游泳節目中、　緊張者、爲女子百公尺决賽、參加者共陽秀瓊等八人、原有之預賽、因參加之人數不多、故爽快改爲决賽、昨日游水看客之衆、不亞前日、甚有遠道來自南京杭州者、旣宜告女子百公尺决賽點名時、只看萬頭　動、人聲鼎沸、而後至之看客、雖皆購得門票、但因宜告客滿、而不得入場者、猶大有人在、</p>
<p>槍聲起處羣魚角逐</p>
<p>楊秀珍居最前綫、其身左爲劉桂珍、劉在五十公尺中、將秀瓊壓倒、於百公尺賽中、不無再勝楊之野心、而楊則祈求於百公尺中、以雪前恥、槍聲一起、繁魚　躍入水、領先者爲陳煥瓊、陳身體短小、速度極佳、一路領導在前、至五十公尺處、陳煥瓊勝楊秀瓊達三公尺、而劉桂珍與楊秀瓊、則並駕齊驅、</p>
<p>桂珍秀瓊競爭激烈</p>
<p>至七十公尺處、陳煥瓊仍佔先、惜陳煥瓊年較幼、氣力不濟、致至最後三十米爲劉桂珍及楊秀瓊追出、此際秀瓊桂珍、競爭最烈、全塲掌聲不絕、桂珍一度超出、但在最後之九公尺、秀瓊以速度勝人、而得優勝、</p>
<p>最後五米决定勝負</p>
<p>楊秀瓊昨日之於百公尺自由式决賽、兇險　生、但於最後五公尺、卒獲勝利、亦云幸矣、斯項因競爭激烈、故前三名均破全國紀錄、前二名破遠運紀錄、成績誌下、</p>
<p>（一）楊秀瓊（港）一分二三秒　（被遠運及全國）</p>
<p>（二）劉桂珍（粵）一分二七秒一（破遠運及全國）</p>

<p>楊維莫星洲土生之華僑也、年僅十六、於中距離游泳、在南洋屢創全國紀錄、去歲王正廷博士南遊、曾賞識楊之身手、對之大加鼓勵、並告其全運會將在滬舉行、囑其返國參加、此次楊之身手非凡、在預賽中、即打破全國紀錄、而在决賽中、又創全國　紀錄、</p>
<p>起碼佔先姿勢輕捷</p>
<p>楊維莫在起碼時、即佔先、其游亡方法非常敏捷、似不甚用力、而速度極快、至五十公尺第一轉身時、麥偉明追隨一楊後約一米、一百五十米處、陳震南超過麥偉明、而進至第二位、</p>
<p>維莫靂南各不相讓</p>
<p>未幾陳震南竟奪勇追上楊維莫、楊則亦不甘屈服、努力前划、在十二百五十米處、幾完全相併、不分軒輊、其餘諸子、落後甚遠、</p>
<p>一氣呵成佔得鰲首</p>
<p>三百五十米後、楊陳二人、競爭仍不分上下、全塲鼓掌聲靂耳如雷、但楊在最後之十米、一氣呵成、陳震南終不敵楊之城力、而屈居第二、但二人之成績、相差甚徵、均破全國紀錄、</p>

<p>女子二百公尺俯亡預賽、楊秀瓊竟告棄權、昨之三百公尺俯泳預賽、昨繼女白公尺决賽後舉行、楊於百公尺中、疲於奔命、險裏逃生、而得保持冠軍之后座、雪洗前日五十公尺之恥、故於二百公尺俯泳棄權、女二百公尺俯泳預賽、第一組第一名廣東陳玉瓊、以三分一二九秒七之成績、打破全國紀錄及遠東運動會紀錄、游來迅速無比、較之二三名、遠達十餘米、第二名區恩照、成續三分五十二秒九、第二組第一名林都麗、成績三分四七秒五、亦破遠運紀錄、但未破全國紀錄、</p>
<p>全國高於遠東</p>
<p>女子游泳一項、所謂之「遠東紀錄」係第十屆遠東運動會中、女子游泳表演之成績也、該次表演、參加者只中菲兩隊、不過十餘人耳、各項表演冠軍、由國人一手包辦、設日人出席、則吾國無可問津、而遠東女子游泳紀錄、國人亦無保持之可能、故現在之遠東紀錄、幼稚至極、甚至較低於全國紀錄、如女子二百公尺俯泳之遠東紀錄爲三分五十八秒（陳煥瓊保持）、而全國紀錄爲三分四一秒一、較超出遠運紀錄、</p>

<p>港粵足球旗鼓相當</p>
<p>理想中之廣東香港足球决賽、今已成爲事實、本屆錦標呼聲、初以廣東最高、及黃紀良馮景祥李天生葉北華因事缺席後、目光咸轉移於香港、但廣東實力、仍不可侮、香港畏於攻、廣東精於守、各有專長、　鼓　當、鹿死誰手、殊難預必、是賽於下午三時開始、一時起爲上海對馬華之三四名决賽、預料今日觀衆之多、仍可媲美作日、</p>
<p>男子籃球南京有望</p>
<p>本屆男子籃球參加各隊、甫京周公認爲最强之隊伍、據一般觀察、菲律賓北乎亦人村濟濟、造諧宏深、菲不幸於次賽即遇南京、而受淘汰、可惜之至、北平昨竟敗於河北、亦非始料所及、上海之敗於南京、不足爲奇、今日京冀决賽、南京可以高枕無愛、</p>
<p>男女網球單打决賽</p>
<p>男女網球變打冠軍、已於昨日解决今日秩字全爲單打决賽、男子得决賽權者、爲許承基邱飛海、邱於昨日雙打决賽中、表演優越、似已恢復當年威風、故今日單打賽中、或將予許承基以極大之威脅、另一組爲林寶華對錢耀彬之落選賽、林連日表演、精彩備至、錢雖火氣太重、但初生之犢、後生可畏、要亦不失爲個中好手也、與林相爭、大刀闊斧、定頗可觀、女子組山西王春芾與上海魏麥谷、互爭首席、晋于抽壓厲害、滬魏穩健可嘉、一硬一軟、一柔一剛、以柔制剛、以硬克軟、孰勝孰敗、必經劇戰、方能分曉、競賽爲黃山農對陳淸、兩人均爲首都代表、藝在伯仲間、預選時雖陳敗於黃、而此次姊妹相逢、必思報復、故亦有一番競爭也、</p>
<p>女子排球滬有厚望</p>
<p>女排球連日結果、廣東上海已躍登高　、今日下午三時舉行决賽、滬隊爲上届錦標盟主、粵隊爲華南巾幗英雌、寃家逢於狹路、精彩表演、定必可觀、惟以實力推則、此爭親局面云、上海聯絡功夫、也能得當、但殺球無勁、爲一大毛病、港隊後路欠周、亦屬缺點、今日决戰、鹿死誰手、猶在各人努力之程度而定、惟滬隊老將星散、少不得籠罩着恐怖印象也、三四名决賽、於一時舉行、湖南較有希望、二三名决賽、則須待錦標落選之一隊實力揭曉、方能推知、</p>

<p>昨日足球複賽、滬、粵、港、馬四强隊、均出戰參戰、龍虎爭鬥、形勢旣極平均、戰來震天撼地、十萬球迷、以能同時參觀四隊戰術、爲最難得機會、紛紛集中田徑場、週圍看臺上、黑簇萬頭攢動、未及下午一時、已坐無隙地、後至者祗可望塲興嘆、各汽車行汽車僱乘一空、江灣道上、車擁擁塞、臨時由南京杭州趕到之學校團體數千人、咸在跑道旁席地而坐、誠爲大會開幕以來、未有之盛況、首場香港戰馬來亞、戰爭劇烈、人仰馬嘶、形勢十分緊張、表演更多精采、結果港軍以三對二、倖獲勝利、第二塲廣東戰上海、滬隊以一比三敗北、港粵兩軍獲得決賽權、將於今日下午三時會師、一決雌雄、足球錦標呼聲、自以香港爲高、但粵軍饒勇拚命、戰事前途半緊球運也、又今日下午一時、複賽失敗隊上海與馬來亞亦將會戰、決戰三四名位次、敗者卽爲第四、勝者再於二十日上午九時、與決賽失敗隊作戰、勝者為亞軍、敗者為第三、此種連環式比試、各隊咸有相遇機會、殊饒有甚深之趣味也、</p>
<h3 id="c218">馬華苦戰　敗於香港　上半時二比一佔優勢砲火劇烈　李惠堂率軍反攻港獲最后勝利 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>李惠堂率軍反攻港獲最后勝利昨日下午一時、銀笛聲中、香港與馬來亞足球戰開幕、全塲空氣、驟形緊張、馬華首先進攻、港軍積極應戰、各有往還、閱十分鐘、香港獲踢角球、由曹桂成主踢、球落在門前最佳地位、雙方泯戰之下、黃美順獲球、遠遠一脚、球由左角入網、歡呼聲中、首開紀錄、</p>
<p>馬華進攻打成平手</p>
<p>馬華受此打擊、竭力反攻、未四分鐘獲一罰球機會、右內鋒盤球傳與右冀尹金振、闖過防御綫、以他輕巧之脚頭、射球入網、包鋼鬥目定口呆、全軍驚悼失色戰成一與〇之平手、茲後球多在馬雜鬥前盤旋、以防衛堅固、球門盡責、並無寸地失陷、球王李惠堂復在嚴重監視下、籌莫展、</p>
<p>鋼門遠救偷渡陰平</p>
<p>至三十一分鐘時、馬華五鋒深入港隊腹地、左衝右突、異常活躍、中鋒謝慶福傳球與左鋒杜亞池、盤過余慶元難關、港軍回救不及、包鋼門見勢萬分危急、輕離老巢、趕前搶球、不料球未搶着、而馬華左內鋒關信德竟獲球、偷渡陰平、飛將軍目天而下、空城一座、抵抗無人、　踢一脚、球欵步入門、包家千返身不及、連連頓脚、二比一、馬華佔先、其後、又混戰許久、港隊軍勢、漸見散漫、復以內御軟弱、時遭攻擊、馬軍左右鋒作戰神速、惜打門尙欠力量、上半時即以二比一終塲、一般觀衆、以港軍氣餒、或疑球王終不能爲力焉、</p>
<p>李陳傳遞球王得手</p>
<p>休息後、易地再戰、馬華球勢益盛港軍雖數度進攻、迭次造成攻鬥機會、或出綫、或越網、終無成就、軍心渙散、於是馬華更爲勇敢、一終戰來、勢如破竹、辛網門憑其經騐手段、保守有方、拳打腳踢、救出不少險球、攻勢稍懈、至第十五分鐘、球王獲球、斜傳與鄭季良、馬軍趕至鄭處搶殺、鄭又傳與球王、李惠堂在三敵人包圍下、球如吸鐵石、始終未離脚下、盤至門前十餘尺處、祇見脚頭起處、球巳入網、淸楚美麗、觀眾有大呼李惠堂萬歲者、港軍如打一嗎啡針、精神爲之大振、勝利轉機、藍完全在此球也、</p>
<p>馬華苦戰一球之差</p>
<p>港軍經球王之拉提、氣勢驟盛、戰績旣成二對一、雙力短兵相接、已達肉搏時期、精采百出、緊張萬狀、觀眾屏息注目、危險處啊唷　致、確爲繪聲繪色之戰、雙方小心翼翼、凡五分鐘未開紀錄、至第二十分鐘、港右內鋒傳球與李、復傳與梁、飛奔衝防綫、球如彈丸、由左角宜投以綱造成三比之紀錄、香港獲勝、於是港勢益振馬華一時陷於苦戰、港五鋒頻頻攻門、均未中的、至三十五分鐘時、馬軍獲罰角球、落點極佳、中鋒趕上一脚、越網而過、最爲可惜、未幾、馬軍三鋒直衝上門、　著地而進、急如流矢、鋼門臥救接住、姿勢妙極、而關信德亦受傷倒地、當由童軍抬出塲外救治、其後馬軍環攻港門者達五次、均由包鋼門化險爲夷、將終塲時、馬軍又獲罰角球機會、一而再、再而三、方欲舉脚、比賽時間已至、港軍以三比二奪得决賽權、</p>

<p>港馬之戰甫畢、滬粵戰士即整裝出塲、樂聲抑揚、舉塲歡呼、三時正、開始接觸、滬軍全綫進攻、萬象華沿邊深入、傳與陳鎮祥、攻門出綫在最初十五分鐘內、滬軍攻勢不衰、萬象華攻門機會最多、以慌促均未得手、混戰久之、雙方均無精采表演、</p>
<p>李寗失脚粵開紀錄</p>
<p>至第二十六分鐘時、粵右內鋒譚江柏獲球、勇往直前、李寗截住接戰、不料稍一大意、李失脚仆地、譚乘機傳球與楊水益、楊又傳與黃永康、黃猛攻球門、張榮才揮拳擊出、又被楊水益所獲、轉身一脚球觸門柱、彈入網內、天意所歸、非戰之罪、一比零、粵軍首開紀錄、</p>
<p>義臣攻門扳回一球</p>
<p>上海雖陷一城、毫不在意、戴麟經統率三軍、直撲敵營、李義臣、孫錦順各有數次極好射門機會、高低左右、尺寸之間、失之交臂、粵方把守益嚴、徐亞輝文武兼全、前後供給、厥功至偉、距上半時終塲祇有五分鐘、觀眾咸爲滬隊着急、幸吉人天相、孫錦順單人匹馬、直闖敵營、李義臣追蹤前進、何佐賢迎上撲孫、孫傳球與李、麥紹漢大吼一聲、舉脚攔球、以來勢過猛、麥被撞倒地受傷、李旣越過大關、輕伸脚頭、攻球中的、打成一對一之平色、</p>
<p>黑炭兇猛榮才受傷</p>
<p>粵以麥受傷調譚江柏爲內衛、繼續應戰、砲火連天變方戰士暴跳如雷、戰事益爲猛烈、一幾粵軍踢角球、小黑炭陳鎭和與守門肉搏、球雖救出張榮才仆傷倒地、　救移時、即躍起應戰、全塲咸讚美其勇敢、越一分鐘、銀笛一聲、首塲終了、大家歡天喜地、宜告休息、雙方以、敵當前、錦標所關、集合戰士、面授方略、</p>
<p>變更陣線粵軍奏功</p>
<p>下半時、粵方變更戰略、調動陣綫軍勢極盛、開球之初、粵軍五鋒如排山倒海、滾滾而來、馮連佐李寗老將鎭靜、左右攔住、戴麟終獲球反攻、衝過防綫、傳與李義臣、已距球門、不足十三碼、球發如彈丸、直出界綫、最爲可惜、羣謂天敗上海之表徵、果也、在第六分鐘時、小黑炭陳鎭和盤球深入、打過數道防綫、攻獲一球、成二比一、粵已勝利、越二分鐘粵軍又至、在滬門前混戰、險象環生、三鋒連人帶球、同時衝進網內、又陷一城、成三比一、滬隊氣餒、大有一蹶不振之勢、</p>
<p>堅壁淸野徒喚奈何</p>
<p>同時粵方守　蕭殿廉、頗具包家平手碗、以孫錦順李義臣之脚頭、亦奈何不得、半小時中、雙方未開紀錄、粵軍以勝利在握、用堅壁淸野方法、四面防守、滬方愈急愈慌、錯誤百出、左右翼傳球、旣極遲緩、孫李脚頭雖準、無機會可踢、更屬傷心萬分、賈幼良兩次在數尺距離處射門、亦未中的、此中似有天意、未幾戰事吿終、上海以一對三失敗、廣東在前屆全運會時决賽戰滬之挫敗、至是始得雪恥、今日下午三時與香港作最後錦標比賽、當有一塲劇戰也、</p>

<p>綜聞昨日港·馬·粵·滬·足球隊之戰、實力伯仲之間、香港五鋒最活潑迅速、左右鋒曹桂成鄭季良、均有飛毛腿功夫、球王李惠棠左右接應、盤過防綫、則箭無虛發、其取勝之道在此、但內衛綫似稍軟弱、幸有包鋼門把守最后關口、使全軍無顧之憂、杏則、殊難獲最后勝利也、馬來亞隊傳球神妙、最長短派司、防衛綫亦配稱適宜、惜五鋒射門經騐不足、每至緊要關頭處、輒慌亂散漫、或射而不中、是爲大病、上海五鋒失之遲緩、尤以兩翼爲甚、孫錦順李臺臣均以拌胖、奔馳不靈、吃虧非淺、防衛綫以上海爲最佳、守門張榮才資格固淺、但昨日之戰、可謂盡了十分責任矣、廣東隊饒勇善戰、五鋒拚命功夫、實可讚美、譚江柏徐亞輝之頭脚、可稱一時無兩、但有時全軍失之火氣過盛、涵養功夫不足、獲勝時固進退咸宜、失敗恐不易控制、未達爐火純靑時期、應加一番修養也、</p>

<p>本屆棒球錦標、上海業自廣東手、奪歸己有、第二廣東、第三北平、第四河北、一幕群雄逐鹿之棒球戰、至時巳告段落、</p>
<p>大功臣　光耀上海史</p>
<p>全運會之有棒球賽、始在第二屆、初次得錦標者華北、第三屆歸諸華東、第四屆覇達移、得者香港、第五屆則屬廣東、本屆乃爲上海攫得、上海先後共三戰、初克湖南、繼服河北終乃壓倒廣東奪得冠軍、三戰之中、未戰廣東爲最重要又最精彩之役、當其時雙方盤馬灣弓虎視不下、勝負之數、尙在不可知之間、第四局中、乃有宿將梁扶初、本其一生三十八年之豐富經騐、擊出人所不備之犧牲打、首爲上海隊開分數之源、加以投手甘鈹球出曲折有勁、華南諸健兒、均屈服於其球卜、寸步雖進、上海陣內、遂鮮有敵跡、保境安民厥功偉大、是一人者、光躍史績、同時全隊人員、亦個個盡職、稱雄全國、事實使然也、</p>
<p>前錦標　先來下馬威</p>
<p>前屆錦標廣東隊、人才出才，偷壘工夫、擊打技藝、均甚可佳、惜投手余伯惠、不克盡其一貫之有勁臂力、在第七局中、大露弱點、開門迎敵、幾至不能下塲、第一局廣東材業首行攻陣、値四球數、步走一壘、乘人不備、又偷二壘、會告明出戰不利、但林再偷至三壘、余伯惠受三打數而退、高漢恩一棒在手、先來下馬威、出一安打、正越一壘之後、林業知機不可失、輕騎疾歸、爲廣東立第一功、周肇均機上、即在一壘中伏、廣東乃反攻為守、靜候上海攻打、上海一再不利、弟一局終了、廣東、一、上海零、第二第三兩局、則各在嚴密監視之下、束手在策、雖上海賀瓊華在第二局得兩壘打、梁澄松在第二局得一壘打、均以孤軍力弱、有志難償、</p>
<p>衆英雄　大閙第四局</p>
<p>第四局廣東先攻不利、輪及上海、安打源源而出、曾瑞康一擊登壘、甘鋮又一安打、曾至　壘、甘居一壘、宿將梁扶初福至心靈、乘人不備、輕輕一觸、作犧牲打、曾遂奏旋而歸、分數簿上、乃開紀錄、甘進壘、梁登一壘、賀瓊華冉一安打、甘梁各升一壘、壘壘皆滿、何憲成上塲、投手送容、各上一壘、甘乃緩步還壘、安樂生攻時、梁亦乘接手錯誤之際、飛奔四壘、其時上海已連得三分、繼續而歸者、後有回憲成安樂生周駿梁澄松叫人、共獲七分、廣東則亳無所得、第五局彼此均未建功、第六局廣東高漢恩安打登學、偷壘、受　傷、改由劉杜明相替、値黃有勳盤出安打、劉乃代高歸壘、黃兆熊亦一安打、不期黃有勳還壘前中伏、全功　棄此後數局、雙方投手接手各顯本領、攻者東手、至第九局後半局、上海以勝利在握、宜告放棄、結果七對二、上海勝、司球裁判張國勳、司壘裁判員陳福田、紀錄員黎　駿、</p>

<p>兩個光盤</p>
<p>聽說山西多雞鴨、此番王氏姊妹帶來不少、故參戰以來、雖所向無敵、但爲聯絡感情起見、戰時常以鷄蛋鴨蛋敬客、與之交鋒者、雖用盡全身本領、要想心領璧還、仍屬勞而無功、四川小姐、當然不能例外、論黎趙球藝、僅與上海二魏相仿、二魏當之、鴨蛋成雙、人各一個、昨日相逢、川姊川妹、自亦不此厚薄薄彼、免得分配不勻、發生糾葛、於是先敬川姊、後贈川妹、均各吃得哈哈大笑、滿載而歸、</p>

<p>女排球複賽、昨日有兩塲對壘、雙方以錦標關係、各竭其能、各盡其力、形勢非常緊凑、而廣東對湖南一塲、尤見精彩、結果廣東以三對二勝湖南、上海以三對零勝北平、今日畢行决賽、戰績如次、</p>
<p>廣東勝湖南</p>
<p>湘軍大勇粵陷窘迫</p>
<p>女排球複賽、粵軍對湖南、一個是老將風範、一個新練精銳、論理戰來必不致十分緊張乃廣東銳氣不足、老於行任者、雖以苦戰、仍操勝算、而戰况已極窘迫、今日出戰上海、奪錦標如仍此局面、則前途殊難樂觀、是塲於一時開賽、湘軍前排、人雖矮小、却精銳强悍、以不畏不餒之决心、努力厮殺、廣東不明對方實力、後排楊杏芬鮑以微更失之大意、半塲經過、險受重創、嗣辛顏秀容於機會來時、獨支大廈、第一局遂得以二十一比十八佔優勢、</p>
<p>死裏逃生打成平手</p>
<p>第二局、湘軍來勢更猛、劉興珩人小胆大、粵軍重兵來犯、動遭擋駕、此日此時、全塲祗見湘軍天下、粵軍不但無從進攻、即欲閉關自守、亦不可得、上半塲竟以二對十一之大差、屈於湖南、轉過陣地、廣東得回壁聲勢之援助、始死裏逃生、一時風雨叱詫、湖南究屬未經大戰、一嚇之下、屢次失手、得少損多、戰壘又換花樣、至十九比十九時、湘軍殺得火起、連下一分、造成一對一之平局、</p>
<p>拳腳交加粵又獲勝</p>
<p>第三局粵軍乘水推舟、輕使寫意、湘軍不免陣綫大亂、上半塲以九比十一之差易陴、轉過馬頭、再圖反攻、但女兒家眼光不遠、南國健兒亦小氣非常、旣來一脚、必還兩拳、紛紛擾擾之中、致爲粵軍奪回一局、湘南老鄉、少不得爲之華頭喪氣、</p>
<p>驚聲動大球響震地</p>
<p>前三局、二勝一負、廣東佔據上風、湖南於此役、如果扳轉、則尙能談到錦標、故於變更戰略、改換陣容之下、力圖振作、廣東亦秣馬萬兵、凖備迎敵，一上場即蛇絞蛇、不見軒輊、再至比數十四比十叫時、方見苗頭、霎時之間、但聞隔岸鶯聲動天、而塲內球響震地、揮手劈殺、煞那之間、湖南以廿一比十九勝、總比數爲二對二、</p>
<p>趾高氣揚廣東進級</p>
<p>第五局來、廣東中排馬杏燕時對區來球、輕傳球網右角、林德貞本技癢難熬、借此一殺、爵積宿寃、一連串地、盡情宣洩、此局後排之救球、本來不大佳妙、以時來運來、亦居然楚楚可觀、造成十六對十八之比數白粵英雌、熱望冉加幾分、即有錦標希望、但不知急勝之下、步伐失序、湘軍連來兩球、平淡無味、而竟以台步踏錯失利、湘軍乃積極肉搏、旅進旅退、不分雌雄、廣東雖屬能征慣戰、亦不免喫一驚嚇、於是步步爲營、鎭靜應付、於各二十分時、始得機重壓、楊玉瓊顏秀容左右二丞相、各着一記、完成全局、於是粵軍大笑、而趾高氣揚、湘軍掩袖而自恨薄命、裁判員於雙方香池涔涔下、宣佈廣東以二對二得决賽權、</p>
<p>上海勝北平</p>
<p>跳躍不高勝來非易</p>
<p>女排球複賽第二塲、上海獨對北平、上海爲上屆全運錦相隊、聲勢喧赫、次賽本戰河南、以豫軍放棄、致上海排球陣容、未曾映人眼廉、昨日出塲、似多數已非舊時人馬、惟中堅黃杏芬、依然故我、北平開球後、理得三分、當年威譽、尙不推扳、張麗珠亦能征慣戰、堪爲棟樑之材、一路戰來、並無大疵、惟兩翼之攔網打球、跳躍不高、而力又不濟、故第一局僅以廿一對中七之比獲勝、雖屬吃力、但並無特別表演、</p>
<p>捧塲聲高反彈琵琶</p>
<p>雙方休息後、再事開火、咿唔啊呀、究不比男子漢來得吃硬、其實贏了要嬌、輸了要哭、本屬小姐們的普通表現、第二局中、先時互有哭笑、惟北平小姐、後衛表演之失態、確爲是局失敗之至要原因、下半塲、場外拉拉隊唱得急急、北平背起琵琶、彈得　　如此如此、即造成廿一對七之局、北平一　　地、</p>
<p>突圍轉安三戰三勝</p>
<p>第三局、北平方紀小姐發球、燕　挿　、已不料女兒份、可見連輸一局、冤毒之深、入人心也、一索之下、喜報宣男、上倓繼之成功、遂成一雙十五、上海人見勢不佳連忙招呼緊急動員、一球落陣、無敢怠慢、居然一洗脂粉氣息、屢陷危落、而屢次突圍、最後之結果、以廿一比十六直落三大敗故都英雌今日滬隊出戰南國健兒、寄語姐兒們好自反之、</p>

<p>男子排球錦標、以過去形勢觀察、自爲滬粵爭霜之天下、粵隊為排球宿將產生之區域、上海又為各處精央集合之所在、兩雄爭遇、勢均力敵、自必有一番惡戰、昨日三時開賽、結果三對〇、滬隊大獲全勝、高擊錦標、增光不少、惟當比賽中途、球戰之外、尙有觀眾向裁判員毆辱之一幕、雖即續賽、然在大命不免爲璧之玷也、許情如下</p>
<p>情緒熱烈滬隊先勝</p>
<p>男排球决賽、昨日下午二時舉行對學者爲備東上海、粵隊　角如雲、滬隊實力平均、一塲　戰、　動整千整萬之姑娘公子、引領期望、各有會心、三時裁判昌錢　勤、檢察員徐紹武、會同兩隊領袖、决定陣地、然後居高發令、上海首先挑釁、略有得分、粵隊繼起後追、造成平局、彼此熙熙攘攘、於熱烈之情緒中、各有建樹、十一對十換塲、上海小勝、專隊亦客客氣氣、並無糾葛、轉變區域、上海以中排之前攻後救、連次進階、成十六分、廣東尙在十一十二之間、黃英傑梅迪督等、見勢不佳、拼性捨命、追成平局、顧殺心太重、關門本領、還差一着、故終局無得、上海以廿一對十六佔先、</p>

<p>第二局、粵軍李福申開球、不得要領、上海得球、卻牢不放鬆、開排抗爭、專司局戶、偶有軟球攔網、則反手一壓、落點輙在網柱左近、旣述目斜、粵隊毫無反應、高球過境、則有丘廣　專司大刀闊斧、　鼎亦推波助瀾、有軟硬調和、幾使對區縛手縛脚、粵隊後排、日有救險工作、未見努力、半响之間、已以十一對六再勝、下半塲、粵隊亦一度反攻、以滬隊曹廷贊前後招顧周到、雖連中大砲、滬隊鋼甲禦身、未遭大難、此時以底綫落球出界問題、微有爭執、旋以司綫員勘定爲根據、旋即消滅、結果廿一對十一、上海再勝一局、滿塲觀眾、於此風狂雨暴之下、嘆爲觀止、彩聲不絕於耳、</p>
<p>發生糾紛裁判受辱</p>
<p>第三塲開球後、雙方拼戰益烈、廣東抱破釜沉舟之决心、故力事掙扎、期背城借一、以挽危急、塲內外觀衆、亦多爲粵隊打氣、乃命運不佳、未能如願、時滬隊仍以　比一列前茅、嗣上海發球過境、經粵隊馬元百托球左翼、前鋒遂乘　壓殺、眼到手到、確是靈敏、裁判員因粵前鋒攔網時、手先於球、故嗚笛判令上海得分、笛聲方起、不圖塲地觀眾中之拉拉隊員、已有四五人怒目而起、聲勢橫兇、抵裁判員坐椅時、即將錢一勒硬手硬脚、用力拉下、幸錢機驚發覺、當由高登躍下、但霎時已受若　毆辱、並撕去裁判證章、在塲維持秩序之警察童軍、急上前保護、將錢護衛出塲、比賽暫停、秩序亦不免紊亂、</p>
<p>緊急會議决定重</p>
<p>錢一勤被毆辱後、雖未受有重傷、但以事關運動道德、與運動紀律、因即向總裁判張伯苓報告經過、旋由張報告大會副會長吳市長、召集重要職員、開緊急會議、副會長吳鐵城、總幹事沈嗣良、競賽委員會主任委員王正廷、裁判股長蔣湘書、警衛組長在大燧等均到、經决議此項比賽、仍繼續進行、至在塲搗亂份子、則設法緝拿、依法嚴懲、並請錢一勤仍到塲担任裁羊、决定後、即由吳市長鐵城、張總裁判伯苓、王委員正廷、沈總幹事嗣良等、及警衛人員、陪同錢氏往排球塲繼續進行比賽、到塲後、吳市長對粵隊人員加以申訓、勉以注重體育精神、然後由張伯苓王正廷沈嗣良等、在旁監視、繼續進行比賽、</p>
<p>三戰三勝滬得錦標</p>
<p>開　後、山丘廣　繼續發球、不數分鐘連下數　、成十一比七、滬隊佔上風、易地後、粵隊梅迪賢會作兩次猛攻、奈滬隊壁壘森嚴、終雖超過雷池、多無功而返、滬隊及乘機猛攻襲擊、因又奪獲多分、結果廿一比十一、滬隊又勝、總結果三比零、滬隊奪得本屆男子排球冠軍、兩隊陣突如次、</p>
<p>糾紛經過一般議論</p>
<p>排球纠紛時期、經大會重要職員蒞塲監視重賽後、似已解决、廿一般觀眾之意思、以爲在裁判員方面言、裁判之公正否、應有合法之抗議手續、决不能動手毆辱、此與提倡運動道德之原旨、根本矛盾、即退一步言、運動在合於正軌之體方協調、動手用武、不在運動會本身方面之問題、可以不必裁制、然則不但大會之尊嚴與紀律風格、將掃蕩無餘、而於法律之立塲言、自猶有未能使人愜意者也、今大會於比賽之終局問題、巳告解决、而於此越執行動、尙無處置途徑、使大會留一惡劣之印象、誠爲不取、况此問題、在將夾裁判制度本身之信念、至有關係、而大會處事之熊度、又另一問題也、</p>

<p>男子雙打得决賽　者、爲上海林寶華邱飛海、與爪哇許承基許承位、於昨日下午三時爭奪冠軍、而許球藝超越、尤以承基更佳、其砲彈式之發球、重若泰山之過頂高壓、峻急無比之正反抽擊、獨步全國、乃弟承位之發球及高壓、均與承基相若、惟經　欠缺、臨陣慌張、昨日慘敗、亦因是故、林邱老將威風、不减當年，林連日苦戰、手足均受微傷、而昨日裏創出塲、表演特佳、劈殺抽壓、出神入化、奔跑迅速、救出險球無數、邱連日表演、球藝退化、雖歷盡艱難、得達决賽週、但還費九牛二虎之力、誰知昨日戰米、奮發有爲一變往昔疲憊不振之狀態而與林搭配、珠聯璧合、無懈可擊、以直落三之輕取勁敵、榮居首席、固出人意外、上海之得網球錦標、已無問題而總錦標之誰　、亦因之解决誠上海之意外收獲也</p>
<p>先發制人</p>
<p>未賽之前、滬網球指導張子震君、以爲林邱連日作戰、疲憊不堪、且表演未見出色、恐非兩許之敵、不忍目睹其　慘敗情形、故遠走他方、不料開賽後、二許大彈琵琶、錯誤百出、林邱破釜沉舟、不慌不忙、連下兩局、嗣後二許續趨鎭定、漸人佳境、不時上網攔殺、以巧妙無比之截球、制敵外命、林邱雖以高球窘敵、弄巧成拙、反予二許以高壓之機會、時時命中要害、三比二、四比三、兩許躍登前茅、林邱宿將、究非弱者、頃刻報以顏色、造成各四平手、下局承基發球、勝利可操左券、惜因求勝心切、錯誤叢生、繼又操之過急、野球迭見、遂爲林邱取得是局、第十局勝負所繫、各不相讓、雙方均各上網、短兵相接、劈拍之聲、不絕於耳、你來我往、煞是好看、林邱終以態度鎭靜、獲得最後勝利、六比四奪獲首盤、先聲奪人、</p>
<p>再接再厲</p>
<p>再戰聲中、一許抖擻精神、奮勇反攻、林邱毫不放鬆、亦步亦趨、因之戰情更爲劇烈、長靠短打、精彩雜陳、各一各二、而至各三、始終不離左右、次局小許發球、接連雙失誤、旋林又上網、施展其拿手傑作、憑兩記美妙截球、取得勝利、繼又加上一局、林邱以五比二遙居上風、一許雖憑高壓扳回一局、終以四比六再告失守、</p>
<p>奠定大局</p>
<p>第三盤林邱勝利在握、益見穩健、老邱亦時有傑作表演、二許則一籌莫展、錯　更多、雖其最拿手之高壓、亦因操切過甚、頻頻自殺網下、林邱則光芒萬丈、氣燄薰天、開始後、即一路順風、以三比一局佔絕對優勢、一許竭力追趕、奪回一局、但狂瀾旣倒、欲挽無從、林邱着着進取、連陛三級、六比二高唱凱歌、獲得最光榮之雙打冠軍、</p>

<p>兩組雙打複賽之失敗者四川對馬華、原定下　午三時起賽、馬華林生望阮國英跚跚來遲、四川王文正錢耀彬特別講交情、不作棄權、因此關始將近四點鐘矣、　點三盤、馬華以二比一佔先、第四盤四川則以五比二居前、因天黑中止、改於今晨上午十時續賽、</p>
<p>各得一盤</p>
<p>開前一盤、馬華頗見順利、四比　、五比、在土錢一再失誤之下、以六比四勝、下盤相爭甚力、各不相讓、間空隙掃射、屢中要害、形勢遂成緊張、各三各、四、各五、各六、各七之後、卒被四川奪得勝利、</p>
<p>馬華佔優</p>
<p>第三盤林望蘇阮國英又恢復原狀、抽擊攔網、得心應手、王錢二人又陷於善戰、失誤頻頻、馬華組一而再、再而三、一氣呵成五局之多、四川急起直追、扳回三局、卒以六比三歸馬華再勝、</p>
<p>天黑中止</p>
<p>時天色巳晚、巳可中止、但雙方球員、仍須繼續比賽、裁判員祇有聽其自然，因光綫不足、表演愈見鬆懈、素然無味、馬華二人、又見不支、四川輕描淡寫、以四比一領前時、裁判員與球員商决再賽二局、不論結果如何、決定停頓、旋成五比二、乃止、今晨十時續賽、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c256">現代中國婦女需要的是新道德 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>濟南通信：省政府主席韓夫人等，近鑒於中國現代婦女，維新者徒慕虛榮，不自檢束，放棄固有之職責，守舊者則驘弱無能，知識卑陋，墨守已往之陋習，致均將周有之舊道德，埋沒殆盡，女子之眞精神，泯滅無餘，女權愈發達，生活之墮落愈甚，文明愈進步，習尙之腐敗愈烈，若不亟加挽救，則提倡女權者，適以摧殘女權，世人重男輕女之觀念，永難消除，爲糾正婦女惡習，惟復婦女道德起見，特聯絡各界明達婦女，組織山東婦女道德促進會，以謀婦女生活之改善。</p>
<p>「中國現代婦女，維新者徒慕虛榮，不自檢束，放棄固有之職責，」這是實情。「守舊者則驘弱無能，知識卑陋，墨守已往之陋習，」這也是實情。但爲什麼會如此呢？武斷說一句：這是中國舊道德所促成！蓋中國婦女，自來生活在舊道德的桎梏下，一點自由都沒有。故維新者，一旦感受新思想的陶化，須奔放不覇。守舊者，旣無知無識，就只好墨守陋習。那末救濟之道，須應把舊道德，根本推翻，重建一種新道德，使婦女有所遵循，這才是辦法。否則中國婦女的生活，恐怕永無進步的希望！然而山東婦女道德促進會，却在那裏慨歎固有道德的埋沒，要以恢復婦女道德的手段，來謀婦女生活的改善。這是錯誤的。</p>
<p>說到女權一問題，這是現代中國婦女所要力爭的。因爲中國婦女的女權，早已給人剝奪殆盡！但是山東婦女道德促進會，却說什麼「女權愈發達，生活之墮落愈甚，文明愈進步，習尙之腐敗愈烈」。本來，在現在的中國，婦女還沒有女權可言，何况是發達呢？須等中國婦女的女權，已有相當的進步，這也不能使婦女生活墮落，現代中國婦女的生活，的確有一部分是墮落的。然這决不是女權發達的罪責，而是有其墮落的另一種因素。且這也只少數的中國婦女是如此。難道女權眞是要不得的嗎？山東婦女道德促進會，以爲這現象「若不亟加挽救，則提倡女權者，適以摧殘女權，有人重男輕女之觀念，永難消除一。那末，試問恢復婦女道德，就能保障女權，就能使重男輕女的觀念消滅嗎？今日中國婦女之沒有女權，世人之重男輕女，都是舊道德的作祟呢！</p>
<p>總之，山東婦女道德促進會的組織，若不是有意復古，便是走錯路程。我們在這裏復說一句。今後要望中國婦女生活的改善，不在舊道德的恢復，而在新道德的建立！</p>
<h3 id="c257">花房 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 雄</p>
<p>新居的院子里，沿階種着一列梧桐樹，牠挺着率直的粗幹，高過樓房的屋脊。夏天，那些屬形的濃密的巨葉像一柄傘似的互相散開來，彷彿覆在樓房的頂上，擋住了焦炙的陽光；而帶來了一陣陣輕微的涼風。樹葉搖動的時侯，窗上構成了美麗的圖案，使人感覺夏天的太陽也有可愛之處。</p>
<p>居停主人是位五十歲光景的長老，他孤獨的獨自住在這里，有一個喜歡捕蟬撲蝴蝶的孩子倍着他。我初次由朋友的介紹曾見他，他說很高興招到像我這樣的同居，他覺得太寂寞了。他給我的影像是受過極大刺激的隱者。</p>
<p>老者愛花如命，院子里排列的花盆以百計。那孩子對於種花的經騐很豐富，每天早上帮同主人分枝，培土，灑水，捕虫，那樣謹愼，不像平時躍躍跳跳的樣子。後來知道他是主人從前僱佣的花匠的兒子。</p>
<p>因爲愛花，主人特地借着梧桐的幹枝底力量，向外架了個可以遮蔽全院子的涼棚，覆以蘆蓆，像捲簾一樣可以起捲，這自然也是那孩子的責任了。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>主人很愛護那孩子，平時談話間他頗有作爲小主人的樣子。他時常感嘆沒有錢造一個精緻的花房爲：「那孩子也太辛苦了，他服侍這些花朶從沒有差悞的時候！」</p>
<p>我閑着無事的時候，靠着窓口看他們倆個在院子里摸東摸西，精密地檢察着每一個盆，發現了病花的時候，他們討論起來了，應該怎樣療飬，醫治，往往久久不决。於是主人仰起頭來對我講話：</p>
<p>「種花是很有興趣的，就是討厭那些虫，簡直沒有辦鈇，捉不勝捉，眼看着牠死去眞彷彿死了親生兒子一樣…」</p>
<p>結語他總是搖搖頭：「能造個花房就好了!」</p>
<p>這樣他踱到我樓上來，拉着我「下一盤棋罷。」主人的棋子不很高明，十次有九次敗在我手里：而這個時候更是敗得快，沒有幾個子，他把棋盤一推，　又敗了」着說過再踱到院子里去。</p>
<p>那孩子就有能耐，他坐在階沿上，雙手捧着頭，他想從那小小腦袋的一角搜尋種花的經騐，或者是父親所告訴他的故事可以使那株病花復活·他老半天坐着不想走開，卽使主人去催促他，他會說出種種的方法來使得主人重復鼓起興趣，倆個子再去療治牠們。</p>
<p>這種情形是很多的，而每次那孩子會把病花蘇甦的。</p>
<p>住久了那孩子和我很投機。有一天，我們在池畔釣魚，我問起他種花的經騐，卻引起他告訴我主人的故事：</p>
<p>那孩子自小是住在主人家里的。主人曾做過官，家財盈萬，老妻早過，有一個獨生子，他把主人的家財化光了，以盜案繫於獄。於是主人退避到近郊的這所僅有的住宅來。當初僱佣花匠，是妝飾他大宅的花園的，有名貴的花搜羅來置植在他花園里以爲榮顯。現在是借種花來消遣寂寞的餘生，偶然死了一株不值分文的花，他會整天駡他的兒子，以致廢寢忘食而害病·「所以」孩子說：「有病花發現的時候，我總相盡方法把牠救活。主人愛我至深，我不忍見他的發瘋狀態。」</p>
<p>我慶幸主人有那樣一個忠誠的僕人，但是聽到他能造一個花房就好了」的時候，我不知所對。</p>
<h3 id="c258">夜過裙帶山 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 沈塢</p>
<p>太陽把頭縮到山腰下邊去，一陣霏紅的霞采輝映着半壁的羣山。山坳間底狹道上的人跡漸漸稀少了，淙淙的流水聲還是清晣地向耳朶吹來，松林和荒荊在彩霞的襯映中格外顯得鮮艷，山坑里深得象個無底的潭；大家再也不敢顧望遠近的景色了，一面提心弔胆地把穩着自己的脚步，恐怕一差池就滾到山坑里去；一面又驚懼着前面那座險峻的裙帶山，那兒的山老鼠們（對强盜的別稱）的手段的凶狠，是誰聽到都會寒心的。</p>
<p>「莊二哥，我們吃這碗飯的人眞是拿性命去換來的，我眞不放心小狗子哪，他沒有了爹，爲娘的眞苦，你在路上總要爲我照顧照顧他，年紀靑靑的不知危險，會搶着走在前頭的，……要是——唉，聽黃家伯伯說：那些山鼠們一些兒也不肯把人放鬆，他怕有老板扮着小伙計哪，那里會一夥子里沒有一個值錢的傢伙？……眞的，說到綉刀花（殺人的一種刀法）才怕煞人！……眞是「九死一生」，十個人恐怕還沒有一個能回轉來的！……」一走到這里，不禁使我記起每次臨行時小狗子的＼親那番嘮嘮叨叨的請來。周圍的山是這樣高聳和險峻，路又是那麽狹小，每一個轉灣的路口，或者荒亂的長草堆中，隨時都可以埋伏着那些山鼠們的。要是碰不着他們，就算是我們的好運氣。以前曾有人放火燒過山里的亂草，想使山鼠們沒有地方好埋伏，結果反而被僱們捉着去綉刀花了。怪可憐呢，吃這口踏在生死關頭上的飯！</p>
<p>「小狗子！川點勁兒吧，老是綿羊拖老牛那麽爬着幹嗎的？你打仗落在後頭就不怕了麽？……」</p>
<p>慢慢地爬上了裙帶山上的險路，小狗子就漸漸走得慢了，老宋任　邊吆喝着他　我回暫鼎　一眼，眞的，　只象是隻螞蟻般蹣跚　走着，怯生生的眼睛望望前面又看看後頭。我不由得不催促他一下：「小狗子，打點精神趕路哪，大家是不會等候你的！」</p>
<p>小狗子這小伙子並不像他母親口中所說的那麼樣：是個不知危險的人，在我們這」夥中，他最年靑，然而却最胆怯，走路老是落在後頭，非經同伴再三催促，永是不會趕到前面來的，眞不像是個靑年的伙子！……</p>
<p>走上裙帶的狹路上，太陽已經落山背後邊打睏了，月亮還沒有起來，周圍已是一片深沉和黯黑的夜海了。幾顆星斗極力要睜大它們的眼珠子，可是山徑里還老是一片烏暗。蟲聲在日落後就開始滿佈在山野間了，這時就更淸晣地傳到耳邊來。不時還有一些「呼　」「呼　」的樹木給山風搜刮着呼嘯，聲音是凄然而且單調的。竹老頭常常說這是老虎或山鼠來時的先兆，其實過後却連一些什麽動靜都沒有發生。有時大約是山鳥之類的鳴叫吧，又使竹老頭疑心到是鬼哭：「冤枉的，我會知道的，今晚回去我給你燒紙錢，不要叫了，讓我們好好地走路吧！…」這樣的呢喃地唸唱着，我們已經不止聽過一回了。松森每次都故意地和他開玩笑：「竹老伯，她不會要你的紙錢的，她要你作伴哪，是女鬼呢！」不然，就是：「他還沒討親的，明兒帶你的女兒來吧，封神哪，裙帶山的土地娘娘！」</p>
<p>但是一碰到松森這麽一說，竹老頭就抖起那個斑白的頭來駡：「殺頭的，有報應的呵，你好亂說話？草紙揩你的嘴！」</p>
<p>可是給松森開了一個玩笑，大家哈哈呵呵地笑了一回，心頭一輕鬆，不再把恐怖在心上，裙帶山這個關口，就易過得多了。</p>
<p>夜靜默着，我們在月色的朗照下，慢慢從山頂又爬到山坳下邊來，越過一重山又一重山，自己好象一個幽靈一樣，忘記了自己還有一條生命。</p>
<h3 id="c259">江南 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>—南行散記之一—</p>
<p>沒有來到江南以前，我的心情像渴望野外一樣望到江南；見到野外的時候，我又渴望着江南似的望到江南的野外。</p>
<p>三等車箱里的人們有的正安靜地翻着畫報，或心愛的小說，有的就和隔座的人炎論着時事。更有些人討論着女人的美麗。</p>
<p>我的四周是空空的，甚至一個人也沒有，他們的談論很少影響我的思想。所以我就很有閑地在那里想些問題。這些問題大半都是跟着別人的談話起來的。頭靠近窗口，望着外面起伏的土地，疲倦的心在火車的輪聲里安靜着。</p>
<p>在學校里的時候，聽一位先生講：江南是美麗的。他是一位唯美派的詩人，他說在南京，你到明孝陵，台城，向四周望去，幾乎桑是善綠的，而日還吟着他的詩句：</p>
<p>是誰家的油海决了口，江南的野外全是綠油油，披綠的姑娘進去無跡，一枝紅桃像夢樣自由！</p>
<p>因此，我夢想江南的野外是一個碧綠的大海，那軟茵似的野草，平舖在廣大的平原上，像流永樣地鮮艷而有光。山土也如此，看去像是要流下來的瀑布，整個的山是一大的玻璃體。</p>
<p>於是，我想到這一個景界。頭依在窗口，瞧無限的路程住後退去。</p>
<p>這時，一個紳士型的人移位到我的對面坐了。他看看我的簡單的衣服和行李，帶着一種輕視的口吻說：</p>
<p>—呵，您是到那兒去的？（純粹的</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>北平話到是好聽的，但是，他的神氣實在叫人受不住：頭搖幌着向我問。）</p>
<p>—我嗎？到上海去的！</p>
<p>—打哪兒來！</p>
<p>北平！</p>
<p>—呵，北平！（停了停）北京是好地方！</p>
<p>接着，他的態度變了，也許是發覺到我也會說北平話的綠故。</p>
<p>—北京呵，可眞是好地方，我也是打那兒來，到上海去。……上海你到過嗎？……沒有？那地方眞討厭，頂叫人討厭的是馬桶！你看北平，住着多舒服，不說別的，像北海，中南海，十刈海，都是好玩的，上海，多住一天眞少活十年！……唉，那個髒呀！</p>
<p>說時，臉前頭，身四周像全是髒的了。用絹手帕擦了一下鼻子，又說了很多話；更特別言明的是『有錢人不要緊，」好像是說：「你這樣的窮光蛋可得去聞馬桶味的！」我爲了保持自己的態度的嚴肅，只是喊了他兩聲，他就又跑到別的地方去了。聽他談的還是北平的事。</p>
<p>他的話並沒有使我對江南厭惡：我依舊喜愛江南的。這原因是我討厭了那灰色的北國，那成天是灰沙扑面的天氣和嚴寒與酷暑。但是，江南還沒有到來。也許江南還遠呢。</p>
<p>不過江南的原外是終於叫我見到的。</p>
<p>在先，將要到浦口的時候，我十分懷疑這些田地的所在：都是赤紅的裸體的土地。沒有一根綠的草。我那時還想：這是江北，過去南京再看吧，也許會好的。</p>
<p>過來南京旱災的景象在一幕幕地換。有的是望不見邊際的赤的。有些地方雖然有着草，那是乾枯的黃草？經過幾個河流，全都乾着吐皮躺在那兒。</p>
<p>那綠的草原呢，可愛的江南！</p>
<p>旱災和水流掩去了這綠的草原。</p>
<p>詩人的騙話將我的希望加强了信仰，鐵的現實撕碎了這夢的憧憬。我的心又被火車載到另一個地方了。</p>

<h3 id="c263">「月兒彎彎」介紹 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>季候巳到了深秋，十月的風給失意的人帶來了悲秋的情緒。在月明皎潔的晚上，我們也許可以聽到這一首民歌，從深閩的怨婦的口中，幽幽地傳出。</p>
<p>月子彎彎照九洲，幾家歡樂幾家愁！</p>
<p>幾家夫婦同羅帳，幾個飄零在外頭。</p>
<p>這是一首膾炙人口的通俗的古詩，描寫人世間的男女，爲了生活的奔波，和環境壓迫，弄得東飄西怕，各飲着別離的苦酒·同是三五團圓之夜，有的是夫倡婦隨，享盡人間艷福，有的却是對月思鄉，臨風懷人，十分悽慘。——「月兒彎彎」就是徐桌呆先生根據了道首民歌當幹綫，把人生的悲歡離合，編寫成一個纏綿悽惻的五幕話劇。</p>
<p>「月兒彎彎」，由胡蝶女士領　，明星公司全體男女演員合演，現在經過兩個多月的排練，已經是完全純熟·大約在不遠的期間之中，就將在新光大戲院公映了。這是明星公司空前的大規模的話劇運動，這千載難逢的盛舉，當然是最近十分轟動的事了·</p>
<p>「月兒彎彎」的劇情的梗概如下：</p>
<p>「月兒彎彎」序幕的開場，是遠在四五年前的一個某城市中，時在中秋之夜，一個美滿的家庭中，有一對年靑夫婦，正在高朋滿座，對月飛觴，但是山洪忽然暴發，這一個歡會，馬上充滿了恐怖空氣。</p>
<p>因爲山洪的暴發，巨大的水災釀成了，一時哀鴻遍野，流亡載道，百姓們都皇皇然如喪家之犬。這其間，那一對年靑的夫婦——陶子芳和妻子曼珠女兒雪兒，也弄得夫婦冲散，骨肉流離，彼此不知所終。</p>
<p>曼珠被大水冲散了她的丈夫以後，祇得帶着女兒，在困苦艱難的生活之下，度着慘澹的歲月。曼珠因爲想念着丈夫，想念着那夫婦間旦旦的信誓，在四五年中，一直過着她那可憐的潦倒貧因的生活，她歷盡滄桑，總癡心地盼着丈夫安然歸來·許多人都勸她嫁，她不肯；對她帮助最多的幼年同學金煥章，癡心愛着她，她也婉轉地拒絕了。規然那男子爲了她，也拒絕了許多女子的熱愛。她祗有一個始終不渝的願望：就是丈夫能翩然歸來，重過甜蜜的歲月。</p>
<p>這是最後的一幕：曹珠歷盡苦辛，依人作嫁，終於在偶然的機會中遇到了她的丈夫。可是人事全非，子芳已經做了一個貴族小姐的丈夫，當着面，竟如陌路蕭郎，假作不認得她了，而且無意之間，他竟害死了曼珠的，也是他自己親生女兒雪兒·曼珠悲痛萬分，同時却像大夢初醒，知道一個女人要依靠丈夫，不過是一種夢想，因爲男子常常是靠不住的·這塲悲劇，雖然當塲說穿，那責族小姐，把子芳責備了一陣以後，因爲同情也願意要她住下來共同生活。但她却終於毅然的離開了她的丈夫·這舞台上的人生的悲劇，便在慘厲的空氣中閉了幕。</p>
<p>「月兒彎彎」有了這樣動人的情節，富於戲劇性的人生表演，悲歡離合，纏綿悽惻，自然處處都能超縱觀眾的情緒。再加了舞台上偉大的佈景，像山洪暴發，洪水汜濫……等淸景，在我國舞臺上，恐怕還是空前的創舉吧？</p>
<p>「月兒彎彎」的演員，是胡蝶女士飾曼珠，王獻齋飾棄舊換新醉生夢死的陶子芳，高占非飾曼珠的幼年同學金煥章，顧蘭君飾把「戀」愛寫成「變」愛的煥章的表妹，嚴月閒飾交際花、朱秋痕飾貴族小姐映玉，舒　文飾陳媽媽……等等，全都是電影界的最優秀的人材，所以她們的一舉一動，一顰一笑，都是體貼入微，和劇中人合而爲一。——他們在銀幕上的演技，是早巳有口皆碑，一致稱頌的了，但這一次大規模的影人舞臺表演，他們的優越的舞臺的藝術表演，却也做到了登峯造極的一步。</p>
<p>愛好話劇的讀者們，待着吧！</p>

<p>(Paris) France announced today that the arms embargo against Abyssinia has been lifted, while arms shipments to Italy are being blocked. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov informed League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol today that the Soviet Union has implemented financial sanctions against Italy and a sales ban on weapons, making the Soviet Union the first country to implement League of Nations financial sanctions. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The governments of eight countries—namely, England, France, Poland, Greece, Cuba, Finland, Colombia, and Latvia—have notified the League of Nations that they have lifted the ban on arms exports to Abyssinia, in accordance with the League's resolution. The Paris Evening News carries a dispatch from Cairo stating that since the lifting of the ban on arms exports to Abyssinia, the first shipment of arms to Abyssinia was carried by a British ship, which passed through the Suez Canal this morning. A second British ship is reportedly following closely behind. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>British Somaliland, Barbara: Shipping industry sources here stated today that seven million rounds of ammunition have been unloaded and brought ashore here. The majority were manufactured in Belgium, and are currently being transported to the southern Abyssinian army. These military supplies will enable the Abyssinian army leaders to provide thousands of reinforcements with appropriate weapons. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) A telegram received here from the Abyssinian capital states that the Abyssinian government has ordered 100,000 Belgian rifles and countless quantities of military supplies. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Economic Committee of the Sanctions Committee today approved in principle the British representative Eden's proposal to boycott Italian exports, and passed the French representative's proposal to ban the export of major products to Italy. Subsequently, a committee was formed to handle this matter specifically. The committee is scheduled to meet on October 29, at which time it will decide on the date for implementing this plan. At the same time, the governments of each country in the Economic Committee will each notify the League of Nations when they can begin implementing this plan. Yugoslavia, Norway, and Soviet Russia today banned the export of military supplies to Italy. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Laval met with British Ambassador to France, Clerk, and Italian Ambassador to France, Cerruti, this morning, each meeting lasting about one hour. According to our correspondent, the Italian government has not yet made a final demand regarding the expansion of Italy into Abyssinia. In addition, the French government has expressed to the British Ambassador its willingness to provide mutual assistance in accordance with Article 16, paragraph 3, of the League of Nations Covenant. However, the British and French cabinets have not yet reached an agreement on the French methods of assisting Britain. Prime Minister Laval will continue his talks with British Ambassador Clerk this afternoon. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain recently inquired with France whether it would assist Britain if the British Mediterranean Fleet were attacked by Italy. It is expected that the French Cabinet will discuss this matter in a meeting, and its reply will be issued on Monday. It is widely believed that the French government will agree to assist Britain. According to official sources, Britain has never mentioned military sanctions against Italy to French Prime Minister Laval or anyone else. Britain has no intention of closing the Suez Canal or implementing a blockade against Italy. Britain only wishes to cooperate with other countries to fulfill all its League of Nations obligations, but Britain is unwilling to bear the burden alone without collective action.</p>
<p>The entire nation is eagerly awaiting Foreign Secretary Hoare's statement on the current international situation when the House of Commons reconvenes next Tuesday. It is widely believed that everything should be clearly announced now to dispel the misunderstandings deliberately created by Italian newspapers and a portion of the French press. Messages emanating from Paris and from other French correspondents seek to create the impression that all the collective steps taken in Geneva are initiated entirely by the British delegation. Britain's policy aims to force Italy to choose between fighting and surrender. The Daily Telegraph today commented on the failure of Laval's recent efforts to bring Italy closer to the League of Nations, stating that, in fact, the basis for negotiations cannot exist until Italy ceases hostilities. The newspaper also addressed the French Prime Minister's statement that his position as a mediator would be more secure if Britain withdrew part of its Mediterranean fleet, stating that Britain finds it difficult to do so at a time when Italian newspapers are producing new arguments to incite hatred against Britain every day. It is now hoped that Laval will provide a concrete response to Britain's inquiry regarding mutual cooperation, which would be a guarantee of stability for the overall situation. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here predict that the Cabinet will notify the nation that, although military sanctions against Italy have not been considered, it cannot guarantee that the implementation of economic sanctions will not lead to war. It is widely believed here that after the special session of Parliament convenes on Thursday, the House of Commons will unanimously support the Cabinet's policy of upholding the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e2">Ambassador Quo Returns to London for Talks - Hopes for Successful Sanctions - Mussolini Will Fall <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi returned to London from Geneva today. His wife did not accompany him and plans to stay in Geneva with friends for several weeks. Ambassador Quo told a Reuters reporter that people in Geneva are very fearful that sanctions against Italy will lead to war. Ambassador Quo compared the League of Nations' current censure of Italy with its handling of the Manchurian Incident four years ago, stating that in his opinion, the League of Nations' leniency towards Japan directly encouraged Mussolini's actions today. The Chinese people now fervently hope that sanctions against Italy will be effective because the only hope for the League of Nations' survival depends on it. Ambassador Quo expressed sympathy for the general opinion that the consequences of sanctions may lead to Mussolini's downfall, internal turmoil in Italy, and the rise of communism.

<h3 id="e3">Naval Cooperation Issue - France Will Reply to England Again - Laval Indicates Decision Possible on Monday <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic situation here tonight is extremely chaotic, partly due to widespread rumors that British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, reported to the Cabinet that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini knows that Britain is fully prepared and determined to force Italy to submit and withdraw its troops from Abyssinia, so he has now decided to strike first and immediately begin armed conflict with Britain. This news is extremely alarming and its nature is so serious that officials cannot confirm it. However, it is noteworthy that officials are also unwilling to deny this claim. It is possible that the report sent by the British Ambassador to the Cabinet was not as strongly worded as the rumors suggest, and only stated that Mussolini's attitude towards the future situation was serious, and specifically asked the Cabinet to pay attention. There is another rumor, though unconfirmed, that is more credible, namely that Mussolini is simultaneously exerting all his efforts to strengthen the ties between France and Italy in all aspects. Recent news reports have stated that the Italian government has requested France to jointly guarantee the security of the Brenner Pass. Although this request is partial in nature, it shows one aspect of Rome's desire to establish a more general joint guarantee with Paris. In summary, the most critical key to the current situation is the French response to Britain. Last night, British Ambassador Clerk visited French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, and the main question he raised was whether France could agree to implement all the provisions of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant and provide assistance to the British Navy in the Mediterranean. Laval indicated that he would only be able to respond to this question on Monday. It is generally believed that the reason why France must postpone its response is that France advocates for Italy to withdraw its troops from Italian Libya, while Britain also withdraws the two large cruisers "Hood" and "Renown" currently stationed in Gibraltar, in exchange for France's guarantee that it will immediately assist Britain if Italy commits aggression. This approach must be negotiated with Italy first before it can be presented to Britain. The reason why France needs to delay its response by three or four days is likely due to this. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today from reliable sources that Britain has presented France with a note that is virtually equivalent to an ultimatum, demanding that France cooperate with Britain in the Mediterranean, otherwise it will lose British assistance on the continent. British officials declined to comment on this, but stated that this news represents the views of the British government. French Foreign Minister Laval has promised to respond to Britain on Monday. Reliable sources declared today that France has notified the League of Nations that it will immediately implement sanctions against Italy. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(New York) The crisis of an open conflict in the Mediterranean between Britain and Italy is becoming more serious than before. Observers here unanimously believe that Britain's refusal to withdraw its fleet from the Mediterranean indicates Britain's seriousness, with the following objectives: (1) To hold a demonstration to force Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to moderate his policies; (2) If Mussolini decides to refuse to end the war in Abyssinia, then prepare for action. Britain's attitude towards France is also a major point in the situation. London has indicated that it has reached the end of its tether with Laval's duplicitous policies. An Associated Press reporter learned from reliable sources that Britain has sent France a note that is virtually equivalent to an ultimatum, stating that if France has no intention of cooperating with Britain, then Britain will align with Germany. However, experts here claim that if Britain and France cooperate, then Mussolini will only have two options: one is to retreat knowing he will fail, and the other is to fight to the end regardless of the consequences. British sources stated today that if Laval refuses Britain's request to use French naval ports in the Mediterranean, then Britain's departure from the League of Nations, following in Hitler's footsteps, is only a matter of time.

<h3 id="e4">League of Nations Attention to the Attitudes of the United States, Germany, and Japan - A Japanese Figure Discusses Two Goals <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The people of the League of Nations are most concerned about the attitudes of non-member states, namely the United States, Japan, and Germany, towards the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. A certain Japanese figure declared, "Japan currently has two goals: one is to intensify the development of 'Manchukuo' so that Japanese goods can obtain considerable sales; the other is to establish a lasting agreement with China in reality. As for Japan's relationship with Soviet Russia, it has become increasingly tense in the last two years. Although no major incidents have occurred on the border, we can no longer ignore the situation in Asia and speak out for Europe or engage in activities in Europe." As for Germany, most observers in that country are currently watching the development of the situation, secretly backing British policy. British sources have also openly advocated this. Regarding the reorganization of the Austrian Cabinet, a certain German figure recently declared to our reporter, "No one is now accusing Germany of interfering in the internal affairs of foreign countries." American sources explained their country's attitude, saying, "If European countries truly want to punish aggressor nations and make them retreat in the face of difficulties, then the contribution of the United States will be no small matter. The United States, on the one hand, expresses anger at Italy's acts of aggression, and on the other hand, still wants to strictly adhere to the neutrality of a neutral country. However, the wartime neutrality law, if strictly interpreted, is actually unfavorable to the aggressor nation. President Roosevelt's recent statement, although stating that the issue of sanctions is unrelated to the United States, said that if the American people trade with belligerent nations, then the government cannot protect them. Therefore, if the American people suffer losses due to the implementation of sanctions by the League of Nations, then they should bear the responsibility themselves." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Member states of the League of Nations will send letters to non-member states such as the United States, Germany, Japan, and Brazil this Saturday, notifying the governments of these countries of the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy and the future policies to be taken, hoping that these countries will participate in the great undertaking. The notification will request a written response from each of these countries, and to prevent these countries from not cooperating, Britain has sought informal opinions in advance and has now assured the League of Nations Secretary that there is great hope for cooperation between the four countries.

<p>Suez: Italians are currently converting the port of Massawa in Italian East Africa into a second Gibraltar. It is reported that fifteen-centimeter cannons have been placed in concealed locations on the sandy shores a few miles north of the port, with a range of about twenty miles. Four-centimeter gun positions capable of bombarding destroyers and light cruisers have also been installed, overlooking the entire bay. Islands outside the port with military significance have also had four-centimeter and six-centimeter gun positions installed at night. There are currently at least five Italian submarines docked in Massawa's waters, but because the numbers on their conical turrets have been painted over, it is impossible to know if there have been any additions. It is believed that the Italian Air Force in East Africa now has a total of about 500 aircraft, mostly bombers, all capable of flying two to three hundred miles. A hundred aircraft recently arrived in Massawa, and it is reported that each is equipped with two machine guns. The structure of these aircraft allows them to fly low and strafe tribal populations. Because there is a lack of concentrated targets in East Africa, machine gun fire is often more effective than bombing. According to reports from Djibouti, an Italian ship carrying 350 aircraft, intending to transport them to Mogadishu in Italian Somaliland, has arrived there. The combination of this aerial offensive strength and Massawa's naval defense layout allows the Italians to control everything in the southern half of the Red Sea. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Mussolini Dissatisfied with Front-Line Generals - Says Progress Slow at Adowa <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(London) Rumors that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the commander of the Italian army in Eritrea had disagreements were initially met with disbelief. However, today, due to the Abyssinian government's communiqué detailing Mussolini's dissatisfaction, these rumors have gained more traction. According to the Daily Telegraph's correspondent in the Abyssinian capital, the Abyssinian government's communiqué stated, "The Abyssinian government has learned that significant disagreements have arisen between Mussolini and the staff of the Eritrean command." It is claimed that Mussolini is very unhappy with the slow progress on the Adowa front. This delay has greatly diminished the morale of the Italian army. Mussolini has been even more critical of General De Bono, claiming that he will replace him as commander of that route. General De Bono has therefore submitted his resignation, stating that due to geographical difficulties, the prevalence of disease in the army, and the lack of food and water, the Abyssinian army is bravely resisting, and the Italian army's morale has long been dampened. It is understood that after De Bono submitted his resignation, the internal dispute within the Italian side has been resolved. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Italian Front Line: Commander De Bono reviewed the entire military situation on the northern front line today and was very satisfied with it. At dawn today, an Abyssinian aircraft flew over the Italian lines to Assab, was shot at by Italian anti-aircraft guns, and immediately retreated. The Italian command is eager to eliminate the entire border of British Somaliland to cut off the Abyssinian army's supply of military supplies. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Djibouti: An Italian team's attempt to establish a base on the Hawash River failed. After fierce fighting, they safely returned to Eritrea today. They initially advanced to the Hawash River, hoping to establish a base there because of the abundant water sources, after the chief of Wossa, Ayuk, submitted to the Italian army. However, they were cut off by the Abyssinian army, and they bravely broke through and retreated to Eritrea. At the same time, the Abyssinian army is now guarding Mount Moussa Ali, which controls the plain of Wossa at 2,000 feet. It is reported that the Danakil tribe is now poisoning the wells to cut off the Italian army's water supply. The Italian army is still working on building a highway to the Djibouti railway to transport artillery. French aircraft are now constantly scouting the border airspace to prevent the conflict from spilling over into French territory. Yassu, the grandson of former Abyssinian Emperor Menelik II, who was imprisoned by the current Emperor several years ago in Ta Juba, is now being sought by the Italians, with the intention of installing him as the Emperor of Abyssinia. As a result, additional guards have been deployed to monitor his imprisonment. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>Abyssinian Capital: 40,000 Abyssinian warriors held a primitive oath ceremony here today, shouting and clamoring as they passed before the Abyssinian Emperor, ordered to resist the Italian army with rifles and swords. The warriors, young and old alike, shouted in unison, "We are the sons of the Lion King, we live for war. We will crush the enemy's corpse to feed the hawks." "Abyssinian Army Minister, Gete, went to the front line today, and read the Abyssinian Emperor's swearing-in proclamation, saying: "I am not a warmonger, but the Italians are pressing us too hard. It is better for us to die for the country than to die of disease. Although the enemy has guns and cannons, God will protect us. When fighting, discard your shields to avoid becoming targets for enemy fire in the sunlight. Do not gather together to fight in the old way, but follow the orders of your leaders, quickly move to sheltered places, and shoot into the air, only after you see the aircraft." After the oath, 100,000 troops marched out of the capital, heading north to fight to the death with the Italian army. These warriors all walked barefoot, their footsteps were very light, but the general public was greatly shaken, leading to rumors that the Abyssinian army was about to launch a major counter-offensive. However, officials still claim that this is not the case, because the Abyssinian army's strategy does not involve offense. The Abyssinian Emperor will soon leave the capital and travel south to meet with Haile Selassie, who has resigned from his post as the League of Nations representative and returned to the country to command the army.

<p>Abyssinian Capital: A Reuters special correspondent stood near the British Embassy today and saw thousands of strong warriors pass before him. These men will march two hundred miles to the Taesi front line. Most of them only carry rifles and spears, with no other military equipment. Behind each tribe follow several women riding mules, carrying food and medicine on the mules. Soldiers will mostly take food along the way. The Abyssinian government has issued orders to the chieftains along the way to prepare for the passage of 100,000 people. When the warriors passed in front of the British Embassy, they cheered to show their respect. The fierce and undisciplined troops of the Gofa tribe also marched to the front lines today. Four of them told the Reuters special correspondent that they had sworn to their wives that they would never return home unless they could prove that they had killed at least one Italian. They also said that they did not want to repeat the brutal acts of the Abyssinians at Adowa in 1896, but would bring back the skull of the Italian they killed to show their wives as proof. The Army Minister said that General Lugtai had postponed his departure to the front lines and would probably fly out tomorrow so that he could reach his destination before the troops arrived.

<p>Abyssinian Capital: According to well-informed sources, the situation of the Abyssinian army on the Tigray front has improved. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Our correspondent with the army declared that the telephone line from the capital to the northern city of Magale has recently been repaired. It is reported that the troops led by Generals Gaza and Kebebe have defeated the rebel general, the former Tigray province's old queen's descendant, Kessas, and recovered the city of Magale. Since then, both sides have suffered heavy losses. 1,500 troops from Italian Eritrea have reportedly surrendered to the Abyssinian authorities in the city. According to a government spokesman, the northern army led by General De Bono, the Italian High Commissioner of East Africa, is demoralized due to the high number of wounded soldiers, lack of food, and difficulty in fighting. The Abyssinian government has formally denied the external rumors that the Abyssinian army has invaded Italian Somaliland and that the Adal tribe in the Awala Magala region of Abyssinia has rebelled.

Hochman said that the Red Cross hospital in Jijiga has now admitted hundreds of people injured by dumdum bullets and poison gas. He estimates that General Nasibu has ambushed one million Abyssinian soldiers in the valley to await the Italian army's advance. Although Italian bombers can destroy materials, they have not been able to eliminate the guerrillas. Abyssinian leaders are confident that they will ultimately win. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Diplomatic Activities Still Underway in Geneva, No Difficulty for Various Countries to Participate in Sanctions <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) A certain key figure in the British delegation recently stated to a Havas News Agency reporter, "Rumors that diplomatic activities have now moved from Geneva to London or Paris are incorrect. The Economic Sanctions Committee has not encountered any significant resistance in drafting the sanctions plan. Firstly, no country refuses to participate in the sanctions. Although countries such as Poland and Switzerland have reluctantly提出some reservations, they still support the sanctions in principle. Secondly, the British side has not only not advocated strict implementation of sanctions but has also requested the committee to consider various special circumstances. Thirdly, France has consistently supported the British viewpoint. Therefore, the future is very promising." Furthermore, according to sources within the League of Nations, even if the compensation and mutual assistance system stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant is extremely complex, the sanctions work should not be delayed or harmed as a result. Regarding this, responsible individuals claim that the Economic Mutual Assistance Committee will likely adopt the proposal of Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu, namely that all countries participating in the sanctions should strive to develop their mutual trade. When redistributing markets in the future, countries that have suffered the greatest losses due to faithfully fulfilling collective measures should receive greater preferential treatment. Conversely, countries that do not implement sanctions should not enjoy these preferences. Reliable sources claim that if this approach is used to resolve the issue, it will not be difficult for countries to gradually restore free trade policies. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The general debate of the Economic Mutual Assistance Committee has concluded. It has now been decided to adopt the following measures: (1) Establish a compensation system to provide countries that suffer losses from participating in sanctions with alternative trade outlets to offset those losses. (2) Establish a credit system to allow countries in need of financial assistance to obtain loans. In addition, measures have been discussed to address those who do not participate in sanctions but individually offer goods for sale to Italy to profit from the opportunity. The committee has now appointed representatives from France, Spain, Britain, Romania, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Italy as drafting committee members to immediately begin drafting a concrete plan for economic mutual assistance. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The United Kingdom exports the most coal to France. Aside from France, Italy is the second-largest customer. Therefore, if economic sanctions are imposed on Italy, the British coal mining regions will inevitably be greatly affected. This is a matter of considerable concern to British officials. After detailed research by various cabinet departments, it was pointed out that if British coal exports to Italy are halted, the losses incurred cannot be compensated. In 1934, Italy purchased a total of 4.7 million tons of coal from the United Kingdom, valued at £3.5 million, accounting for one-eighth of the total British coal exports. Aside from France, which purchases £7 million worth of British coal annually, no other country purchases as much as Italy. Therefore, some key figures believe that the United Kingdom's imposition of sanctions on Italy is definitely not in the UK's own interests, as can be seen from this perspective. Furthermore, officials believe that this loss is impossible to compensate for. In Europe, the amount of coal purchased by various European countries cannot be changed. Countries such as the Baltic states and Spain purchase most of their required coal from the United Kingdom, and this cannot be increased. The amount of coal purchased by Germany, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands also cannot be changed. As for Poland, it is not a customer but instead exports coal, competing with the United Kingdom. In addition, the countries of the Balkan Peninsula do not require much coal. The only way to seek compensation is to increase sales to Greece or countries outside Europe, such as Egypt, to offset the loss of the Italian market, which is extremely difficult.

<p>(Vienna) After yesterday's cabinet resignation and reorganization by Dr. Schuschnigg, Heimwehr leader Starhemberg is now the dictator of all Austrian autocracy. Although Schuschnigg still holds the post of chancellor, he is no different from a puppet. His existence in the news is only to avoid opposition from the Catholic Party. The cabinet reshuffle has placed all key government positions under the control of the Heimwehr. It is expected that the new cabinet's pro-Italian stance will be even stronger than before. It is reported that this new government is the 25th Austrian government since the end of the European War. Although the country claims to be peaceful, the Vienna Heimwehr and the Farmers' League are secretly jealous of Starhemberg. The Farmers' League has 300,000 members and its power should not be underestimated. Starhemberg is a descendant of an Austrian noble family with a long history and has always been a royalist. He has admitted that his goal is to restore the Habsburg monarchy. He associated with Hitler in his early years and was responsible for studying Italian Fascism, thus harboring the ambition to form his own army. Therefore, he founded the paramilitary Heimwehr, whose organization is very similar to Germany's National Socialist Party and Mussolini's Blackshirts. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Chancellor Schuschnigg and the entire cabinet resigned today. However, the cabinet was soon successfully reorganized. In the new cabinet, Interior Minister and Director General of Public Security Fey was removed and replaced by Baron Wölfel, leader of the national Heimwehr. Fey was the leader of the Vienna Heimwehr. Today's cabinet resignation was the result of the Heimwehr in southern Austria threatening the capital. This change ended with Baron Wolf succeeded him as Minister of the Interior. The inside story is that Chancellor Schuschnigg and Heimwehr leader Prince Starhemberg united to exclude radical elements in the Heimwehr. After the reorganization, Austria's foreign policy remains conservatively pro-Italian. Schuschnigg remains Chancellor. In addition to Fey, Justice Minister Karwinsky and Agriculture Minister Reither have also been excluded, and replaced by two members of the Socialist Party close to Prince Starhemberg and two conservative leaders in the Heimwehr. One of them is a cabinet minister without portfolio. Today, rumors circulated that Fey had plotted a coup, which failed due to the cabinet change. However, this claim could not be confirmed. Prince Starhemberg announced that the volunteer army would be reorganized by merging with the original organization and removing all unqualified members. The government issued a communiqué today, announcing that its policies of maintaining Austrian independence and assisting the domestic economy remain unchanged. (National News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department reports that government tax revenues are lower than last year, making discussions of tax increases in the next Congress more likely. The Budget Bureau previously estimated that this year's tax revenues would increase by $670,000,000 compared to last year. However, revenues for the first three and a half months of this year were only $1,120,192,388, compared to $1,121,363,496 for the same period in 1934. The agricultural adjustment tax caused $100,000,000 to be suspended due to lawsuits. However, ordinary taxes have also been decreasing in recent weeks, offsetting the peak season in July and August.

<h3 id="e22">Military Situation of British-Italian Confrontation <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War, the British government has, in its diplomatic efforts, advocated strict sanctions against Italy. It has, within a very short period, enabled the League of Nations to successively pass three concrete proposals regarding economic sanctions. In military terms, it concentrated the main force of its navy in the Mediterranean to prepare for contingencies. According to recent news, the British military authorities have again transferred five battleships and ten destroyers to the Mediterranean and held a naval exercise of a demonstrative nature on the evening of the 15th. At the same time, British ships from the West Indies were requisitioned to return to Europe to aid in defense. Although French Premier Laval has recently been strongly urging the British authorities to reduce their military presence in the Mediterranean in order to ease the crisis of war, the British government has ultimately not heeded his advice. A semi-official British spokesman has publicly stated in recent days that the United Kingdom may be forced to block Italian coasts, the Suez Canal, and the mouths of the Red Sea. Furthermore, yesterday's London dispatch had a 可　credible rumor that Mussolini had decided to strike first and initiate armed conflict with the United Kingdom. Since the European War, the treacherousness of the Mediterranean situation has rarely exceeded what it is today.</p>
<p>The increasingly expansionist military strength of Fascist Italy in recent years was, in fact, fostered by the United Kingdom. Its greed for Abyssinia was also, in fact, induced by the United Kingdom. The UK originally wanted to use Italy's power to suppress France and Germany. Now that Italy has actually launched an attack on Abyssinia, the United Kingdom has turned against Italy. The reason for this is that once Mussolini's eastern expedition succeeds, it would pose a serious threat to the vast and scattered British Empire on its main route connecting to the Far East. Please, based on this meaning, discuss the military situation of the two countries in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>First, regarding the terrain, if the United Kingdom wants to maintain the route through Suez, it must maintain its military posture controlling the Mediterranean. The eastern and western gateways of the Mediterranean, Port Said and Gibraltar, are both under British control and have fortresses. Malta in the center also has a naval port built with a large navy stationed there. The above three places have formed a solid military communication line. In addition, the United Kingdom also pays attention to the defense of the Suez Canal. A Famagusta military port has been built on the island of Cyprus, forming a triangular defense line with Port Said and Jaffa in Palestine. Today, the British Empire's layout to control the Mediterranean is roughly like this. However, on the Italian side, since occupying Libya in 1912, a military port has been built in Tripoli. It has acquired a military base on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. The Dodecanese Islands opposite Asia Minor were also occupied by Italy in 1912. The military ports built by Italy on its islands of Rhodes and Leros in recent years not only threaten the southern coast of Turkey, but also force the British navy in the eastern Mediterranean to be more vigilant. The Italian navy stationed on the two islands can launch attacks on the British navy's triangular defense line at any time.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding strength, the progress of world air force tactics in recent years is sufficient to reduce the power of the navy. This is a consensus among military experts. Italy's large air force today has the potential to shake the two fortresses of Malta and Gibraltar. Even the British military expert Strappo Borghi does not deny this. Let us put aside the air force for the moment and only compare the naval strength of the two countries. According to an article by British naval expert Paivat published in the London Daily News in August, Italy's newly built cruisers and existing submarines are considered more elite than those of the United Kingdom. The dreadnoughts under construction are the largest in the world. However, Italy's naval modernization plan has not yet been completed, and the navy that has received rigorous training is only 85,000 strong. Whether it has the ability to control the United Kingdom's eastern route is still difficult to say. According to an investigation by the British naval authorities, Italian warships in the Mediterranean have a total displacement of 284,734 tons, while the total displacement of the British Empire's standing fleet in the Mediterranean is only 200,000 tons. If something happens in the Mediterranean, the United Kingdom can still requisition its home fleet and Far East fleet. But judging from the above situation, unless it truly cooperates with France, the United Kingdom's sole strength may still be difficult to overwhelm Italy.</p>
<p>In summary, the United Kingdom's position in the Mediterranean today is far from comparable to what it was in the past. When Mussolini had a border dispute with Greece in 1923 and attempted to occupy Corfu Island, he was still wary of British intervention. Today, the situation in the Mediterranean is such that Italy has already dispatched 200,000 to 300,000 troops, along with countless airplanes, tanks, and all military supplies, to the border of Abyssinia, spending more than 200 million lire. At this moment, when the Fascist spirit is unleashed and difficult to restrain, seeking a peaceful resolution to the British-Italian conflict is certainly far less easy than the 1923 incident.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Xia Shirong, the prosecutor of Qu County, Zhejiang, telegraphed the Judicial Yuan, stating that Article 266 of the Criminal Law stipulates that those who gamble for money in public huts or places accessible to the public shall be fined up to 1,000 yuan, but this restriction does not apply to gambling with objects used for temporary entertainment. The second clause states that the gambling instruments and the money at the gambling table or exchange counters, whether belonging to the offender or not, shall be confiscated. According to legal interpretation, the "on the spot" in the second clause refers to the public huts or places accessible to the public mentioned in the first clause. Now, a certain Jia gambled at home and was raided by the Public Security Bureau. The gambling instruments and the gambling money on the gambling table were sent to the court for investigation. As it was not a public place or a hut accessible to the public, the gambling for money should not be punished according to law. The court decided not to prosecute. However, since Jia's act of gambling is not punishable, and the gambling instruments and gambling money were not seized in a public place or a place accessible to the public, can they still be regarded as contraband and confiscated? How should they be handled? Please interpret. The Judicial Yuan explained that the seized gambling instruments and gambling money are not contraband and cannot be confiscated separately. Since the decision has been made not to prosecute, Article 238, Section 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law should be followed. (Special Telegram, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e87">Shandong: Break in the Dyke at Juancheng. The Situation at the Dongzhuang Mouth is About to Change Dramatically. Plans for Closing the Mouth are About to Change. <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The situation at the dike in Juancheng has been tight for nearly a week. Qin Daoyu, the magistrate of Juancheng County, is leading more than 2,000 civilians in a desperate effort to reinforce the dike, fighting the Yellow River day and night. Pan Yifen, the engineering section chief of the River Affairs Bureau, and Chen Wenmo, the head of the upper reaches section, have also arrived to mobilize workers and materials to jointly protect the dike. However, the dangerous section is 100 zhang long, and the dike body has collapsed completely. Repairs are immediately lost. On the 16th, due to strong northwest winds, the Yellow River emptied and violently scoured the dike body, causing water seepage everywhere, making it impossible to block. At 8:30 AM on the 17th, a break occurred on the southern section. Officials and civilians retreated to the small embankment, increasing its height and thickness. It is still unknown whether it can be blocked. According to a telegram from Song Wentian, the chief engineer of the dike closure committee, the breach is 10 zhang wide and 3 chi deep. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, rushed from Kaifeng on the 17th, but it was too late. Han Fuju received a telegram from Qin Daoyu early on the 17th reporting the critical situation and replied that there was no need to worry and to do everything possible to protect it. After receiving the report of the breach, he still ordered Zhang Lianjia to supervise the protection. According to the observation of the dike closure committee, the Yellow River water is breaking through the Juancheng dike and flowing eastward, and in the future it may still enter the main river at Huanghuasi in the Huanghuasi, and the water leaking from the Dongzhuang Linpu mouth will inevitably decrease, or even silt up to become a dry mouth, which also cannot be known, the situation will inevitably change dramatically, the original plan for the dike closure project of the province, I am afraid it will change, and good supporting engineering will be more important, etc. The telegrams reporting the breach and the situation of the dam are recorded below.</p>
<p>Report Summary</p>
<p>(1) Limited to immediate arrival, to Zhang Junjian, Director of Jinan River Affairs Bureau, to be opened by Zhao Xunjian, Section Chief. I have wired a message to understand and look into it. From last night to this morning, six willow pillows have been pushed in, about 40 zhang long, and are being urgently added. About 2,000 civilians are distributed in the water overnight, working desperately to add sacks, but the working section is too long and the soil quality is too bad, and they collapse as soon as they are added, taking care of one but not the other, and they are overwhelmed. This morning at dawn, leaks appeared repeatedly, and after a desperate blockage, the water was not allowed to pass. Extending to 7:00, two more leaks appeared at the upper end, which were very violent. After blocking, they were strictly supervised by soldiers and rushed to block the water. After the blockage was completed, they were pursued and pressed with sacks, but the water flow was too fast to block. At 8:30, the embankment collapsed. We can only strictly supervise the soldiers to retreat to the small dam. However, since the dam is newly built and has not been weathered, and it is sandy soil, it is difficult to predict whether it can resist the water. Respectfully submitted by Qin Daoyu, Magistrate of Juancheng County, Chen Wenmo, Chief of the Upper Reaches Section, and Pan Yifen, Section Chief. (2) Briefly. I respectfully acknowledged the telegram. This morning, I set off from Kaifeng to investigate the collapse of the river banks at Tianhezui in the second section of southern Hebei Province and Lengzhai in the fourth section of the southern province, which are currently only twelve or thirteen zhang away. The bureau staff and soldiers are actively protecting them. If the water does not rise, there will be no danger for the time being. Arrived at Dongzhuang at 7:00 tonight. Respectfully reported by Zhang Lianjia (3) (Briefly) I humbly acknowledge it. At 9:00 this morning, Chen, Director of the Upper Reaches Section, reported by telephone from Duzhuang that the Juancheng civilian-built dam was not being maintained. Two villages were flooded. They are currently trying to protect the retreat, etc. discussed and submitted by Zhang Lianjia, Director of Shandong River Affairs Bureau. (4) Most Urgent. To Chairman Han of the Jinan Provincial Government, Juancheng dam has been rescued in vain for days, and collapsed through the water at 8:30 in the morning. We are now retreating to the pre-repaired small retreat dam and are working hard to increase its height and thickness. It is found that more than 20 sections of the dam have been repaired at the break, and they still have the effect of digging out the river. However, all the embankment cables are hanging and urgently need to be added. In addition to the River Affairs Bureau allocating straw materials, poles, and ropes to temporarily help with the rescue, please approve Juancheng's rescue fund of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan to increase public support and maintain important construction work. Zhang Lianjia (5) Urgent, to Zhang, Chairman of the Jinan Blockade Committee. According to reports, the Juancheng civilian dam has been opened, with a width of ten zhang and a water depth of three chi. The people are currently protecting the retreat dam. The current water level is falling day by day, and the retreat dam is easier to defend. Specially heard by Song Wentian.</p>
<p>Shape of the Dyke</p>
<p>The Yucheng Dyke is between the great dyke and the civilian dyke, initially built by the local people to prevent water leakage from the civilian dyke in the Lishengtun area and to protect the safety of the river loop. On the night of July 10 this year, the Lishengtun civilian dyke broke, and the water flowed south, breaking through the great dyke between Linpu and Dongzhuang, flooding western Shandong. Qin Daoyu, the magistrate of Juancheng County, feared that the river would roll eastward, endangering the river loop, so he led thousands of civilians to reinforce the Yucheng Dyke. At that time, the Yucheng Dyke was no more than five feet high and no more than one zhang wide. On the 11th, many loopholes were found. Qin Daoyu then requisitioned 30,000 civilians to repair it overnight, thickening and widening the dam. The base width was twelve zhang, the top width was three zhang six chi, and the height was one zhang two chi, thus becoming the only lifeline to protect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in the river loop. Later, the current rolled eastward, the remaining dam collapsed, approaching the Yucheng Dyke, and there were repeated dangers. For the sake of safety, Qin Daoyu added a retreat dam behind the Yucheng Dyke, 580 zhang long, the base of the dam was four zhang wide, the top was one zhang five chi wide, and the height was eight chi. After that, the river's momentum was suddenly fast and slow, and for more than three months, there were rescue efforts from time to time. The public has exhausted their strength. Li Yizhi, the former chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, once advocated that the Yucheng Dyke should be excavated to reduce the leakage from the mouth, making it easier to block. However, it was dismissed due to opposition from the people in the river loop. In the past month, the situation at the mouth has changed dramatically. The river water rushes out from the Lishengtun residual dike, passing through Daxiaoyanglou Wuzhuang to Xuzhuang, and has been brushed into a large east-west river channel, which is very smooth. The Yucheng Dyke was the first to bear the brunt. In the past week, the situation has become even more serious. More than 2,000 civilians have been working together to protect it. Qin Daoyu, the magistrate of Yucheng County, Pan Jianfen, the engineering section chief of the River Affairs Bureau, and Chen Wenmo, the head of the upper reaches section, have all arrived to help direct the work. In the end, it was difficult to change God's will, and it collapsed on the 17th. Although there is a retreat dyke behind it, according to general observation, the retreat dyke is soft and sandy and is difficult to resist. The water will inevitably flow eastward and will still follow the old course of the 14th year's breach and re-enter the main river at Huanghuasi in Shouzhang. Inside the river loop, in addition to the Yucheng county seat, there are more than 10,000 hectares of good farmland in Yuncheng, Fan County, Shouzhang, and other counties. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">One of Shandong's Outstanding Cases: The Qingdao Guowu Farm. Recovered After Negotiations by the Municipal Government. More Than 15,000 Acres of Farmland. <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Guowu Farm, operated by the Japanese in this city, is one of the outstanding cases in the detailed agreement for Shandong. Previous attempts to negotiate by each former standing committee ended without resolution due to the high prices demanded by the Japanese. Although this topic is small, it is of great importance to the integrity of our country's land administration. The current municipal authorities have repeatedly negotiated through assigned personnel, and as a result, the farmland has been completely recovered at a price of 81,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Origin of Guowu Farm</p>
<p>In the third year of the Republic of China (1914), after the Japanese occupied Qingdao, people from Japan rushed to the island to do business or farm. At that time, a certain Japanese person, taking advantage of the power of the Japanese government, forcibly bought land from the people in the Licun and Cangkou areas outside the city at the lowest price, ranging from dozens of yuan per mu. After the purchase, they were still rented to the original landlords for cultivation and rented annually. Later, a certain Japanese person sold the farmland to the Guowu Farm Company. This is the origin of Guowu Farm. In total, the farm bought about 15,873 mu of farmland before and after. When our country officially recovered Qingdao in December of the eleventh year of the Republic of China (1922), the Guowu Farm was also included in the detailed agreement for outstanding cases in Shandong. Item 4 of the supplement stipulates that "the Chinese government will recover the Guowu Farm and other large farms operated by the Japanese in the former German leased territory with fair compensation." In addition, it is noted that "details of the aforementioned recovery will be agreed upon by the Qingdao Commercial Bureau and the Japanese military officer."</p>
<p>The Process of Negotiating Recovery</p>
<p>Since our country recovered Qingdao, and the Guowu Farm was related to the issue of our country's land administration, negotiations could not be delayed. However, the Japanese initially demanded a staggering 10.4 million yuan. The municipal authorities were unable to proceed because of the excessive price. Therefore, negotiations with each past administration repeatedly stalled and yielded no results. The current mayor, Shen Honglie, recently sent Xie Zuyuan, the chief of the Municipal Government's Department No. 1, to negotiate repeatedly with the Japanese consul. After eleven years, this outstanding case was completely resolved this spring. Our side prepared a price of 81,000 yuan to recover all the farmland of the farm. Shen made a special gold commemorative medal for Xie's work on this case to reward him for his labor.</p>
<p>Renting After Recovery</p>
<p>After the municipal government recovered the farmland, the Finance Bureau stipulated that it be divided into three grades and still leased by the original landlords. The first grade is 200 yuan per mu, the second grade is 150 mu per mu, and the third grade is 100 yuan per mu. After all the farmland is released, a rent of 300,000 yuan can be obtained. However, it is heard that when the Japanese bought the land, they only gave dozens of yuan, and this time the lowest price released by the Finance Bureau is also more than 100 yuan. Therefore, many people are watching and waiting and are unwilling to lease. Recently, they also plan to jointly petition the municipal authorities to reduce the price in order to show sympathy.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Guangdong Province Issues Another 5 Million Yuan in Public Bonds to Fund Various Construction Projects <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Guangdong Province has been enveloped in a general economic downturn. Commerce is far from what it used to be. At the same time, the rural economy is collapsing. In impoverished counties and areas that have suffered from natural disasters such as floods and droughts, the wealthy have declined, middle-class families can barely make ends meet, and those without permanent property are mostly destitute, or even die in ditches. For example, stores in Shanwei in Lufeng County and Southwest in Sanshui County have recently closed one after another. In the rural silk farms of Shunde County, the old and weak are crying for food. Those who can make a living can only get one full meal a day, and the rest are wrapped in coarse grains. The people are so poor that the exhaustion of rural finance can be seen. As a result, society and the business community are extremely depressed, and government tax revenues have also been greatly affected. The fiscal budget for the 24th year of the Republic (1935) is insufficient. Therefore, there is a resolution to pay administrative expenses at 80%. Although administrative expenses are paid at 80%, construction projects that should be carried out in the three-year plan must still be implemented. If we want to implement them, we must find ways to raise funds. Therefore, the government recently decided to raise public bonds and issue 5 million yuan of construction public bonds for various construction purposes. Last month, Chen Yuanzhen, manager of the Guangdong Provincial State-Owned Products Management Office, and Chen Zhongbi, president of the Guangzhou Municipal Bank, were sent to Beijing to discuss the construction public bond plan with the central financial authorities. When they passed through Shanghai, they also contacted the Shanghai financial community to discuss sales methods. The two Chens have already returned to Guangdong. It is said that this trip to Beijing and Shanghai has concrete methods for the issuance and sale of construction public bonds. As soon as the bonds are printed, they can be shipped to Shanghai for sale. The bonds are printed by the Shanghai Commercial Press and will be delivered in batches around the beginning of November. After the issuing agency signs and seals the bonds, they will be issued around the beginning of December. In the future, they will be sold in Guangdong and Shanghai, and if necessary, they will be distributed to various places in Beijing and Wuhan. Those who act as agents for sales will be given considerable benefits by the issuing agency to encourage them. These bonds are specifically used for construction, industry, and commerce in Guangdong Province, and a portion will be allocated to supplement the circulating funds of various state-owned factories. Detailed allocation will be specified one by one and must not be used for other purposes. (October 14)</p>

<h3 id="e92">Wuxi: Active Silk Market and Silkworm Cocoon Conditions <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The spring silkworm harvest in Xiyi this year was good, and the silk reeling was excellent. In addition, the silk sales in Europe and the United States were active, and the silk market gradually rose. At present, it has reached 610 yuan, so the silk industry is showing signs of recovery. There are 41 factories operating in the whole city. However, the market situation for dry silkworm cocoons is strong. Southern goods require 250 yuan, and the prospects are still bullish. Northern goods are priced at 160 yuan, but there is a serious shortage of inventory. It is estimated that the current inventory of cocoons is only enough for the year. Once the spring begins, there will be no raw materials to make, and the demand for silk in Europe and the United States is still strong, and it seems that supply cannot meet demand. The reasons for this surge in sales are: (1) The European and American silk sales markets have long been monopolized by Japanese silk. This year, Japanese production has fallen sharply, and Chinese silk has been able to seize the opportunity to rise. (2) The American recovery movement has been effective, and the silk industry's operations have improved, and the demand for raw silk has increased, so sales have become increasingly prosperous. In addition, the silkworm breeding model area, in view of the rising silk sales and the lack of raw materials, is trying its best to promote the late autumn silkworm. More than 20,000 sheets of seeds have been issued. At first, due to the warm weather, the silkworms developed very well. Now, most of them have reached the stage of large hibernation and leaf opening, and the late ones are also in the third hibernation stage. However, the weather has changed drastically, with varying degrees of cold and warmth. Most of them have turned into white zombies with pus and empty heads. The harvest is expected to be only about 60%.</p>

<p>The riverbank from the north to Huangtiangang is a prosperous area for merchants from Jiangnan and Jiangbei. There is no road there, and the original embankment is narrow, and vehicles are crowded. At the county government affairs meeting on the 16th, County Magistrate Yan proposed that if a road is built from Junshan Park to the riverbank, merchants coming to Cheng from the upper and lower reaches of the river and from Jiangbei can also reach the city directly via Zhongshan Road. It was decided to first build the roadbed to facilitate traffic. The construction section will design it, prepare a budget, and submit it to the Construction Committee for review and handling.</p>

Haimen is still suing the Executive Yuan. Currently, people from Tonghai and Haimen counties are acting as mediators and will negotiate a solution in Shanghai in the coming days.</p>

<p>The drought in various counties in northern Anhui is severe, surpassing the floods of the 20th year of the Republic in severity. Each county is successively appealing to the province for relief, but the provincial treasury is also strained, with no way to provide assistance. The provincial government has specifically telegraphed the Central Relief Commission, requesting the allocation of substantial funds to save the disaster-stricken populace. The original telegram is as follows: "The counties in northern Anhui Province have suffered a severe drought between summer and autumn, resulting in a failed harvest of millet and widespread misery. The drought disaster is extremely serious, even surpassing the floods along the Yangtze River this year. Urgent appeals for relief from various counties are pouring in, and Commissioner Xi Chulin has also come to the province to detail the disaster situation and plead for assistance. We are currently working with the province's disaster relief committee to find ways to provide relief. However, due to years of disasters and widespread hardship, even with our best efforts, fundraising efforts are insufficient to meet the severe disaster. We earnestly request your committee to consider the extraordinary severity of the drought in northern Anhui and swiftly allocate substantial funds for disaster relief."</p>

<h3 id="e107">Cotton Adulteration with Water and Impurities Slightly Restrained; Suppression Work Has Achieved Considerable Results <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that because ordinary cotton farmers and merchants covet meager profits, the practice of adulterating cotton with water and impurities has been prevalent. Since the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Suppressing Adulteration of Cotton with Water and Impurities and its implementing rules last year, the Central Cotton Adulteration Suppression Office of the National Economic Council's Cotton Industry Control Committee was established, and joint Cotton Adulteration Suppression Offices in Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Hubei provinces were formed with the construction departments of the four provinces. The heads of the construction departments of each province concurrently serve as directors to implement investigations and inspections. The work of each office has now reached one year. Reporters visited the person in charge of the Central Cotton Adulteration Suppression Office and learned that each suppression office has been able to handle the inspection of cotton conscientiously. All cases that have been discovered have been strictly dealt with according to the law. As a result, the practice of adulterating cotton with water and impurities has been slightly restrained. The following is an excerpt of the major cases of punishment for adulteration with water and impurities: 1. The Jiading District sub-office of Jiangsu Province discovered a certain flower shop and ginner in Taicang, Sha Creek, and transferred the case to the Taicang County government, which also handles judicial affairs, and sentenced the manager of the shop to a fine of 250 yuan and two months of detention. In addition, the Nantong District sub-office discovered an agent of a yarn factory transporting cotton with impurities, and sent him to the Changshu County government, which sentenced him to a fine of 100 yuan. 2. The Zheng County sub-office of Henan Province discovered a batch of cotton adulterated by cotton merchant Zhang and sent it to the county government, which fined him 300 yuan. The Shan County sub-office discovered a batch of cotton adulterated with water by a certain flower shop and sent it to the county government, which sentenced it to a fine of 800 yuan and three months of imprisonment. In addition, the Luo County sub-office discovered a batch of cotton adulterated with water by a certain flower shop and sent it to the county government, which sentenced it to a fine of 400 yuan. 3. The Weinan sub-office of Shaanxi Province discovered that a batch of cotton adulterated by cotton merchant Wang was sentenced by the county government to a fine of 100 yuan, or 100 days of imprisonment in lieu of payment. The Jingyang sub-office discovered that a certain flower shop's re-examined cotton was unqualified and sent it to the county government for a fine. 4. The First District sub-office of Hubei Province discovered a batch of cotton adulterated by a certain flower shop and sent it to the Guanghua County government, which sentenced it to a fine of 1,000 yuan. In addition, the office discovered that a batch of cotton adulterated by cotton merchant Xu was sentenced by the Guanghua County government to one year of imprisonment. The moisture and impurity content of Chinese cotton has indeed gradually decreased in recent years. The following is a comparison table of the highest and lowest percentages of moisture and impurities in Chinese cotton over the past two years for reference.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Decisions from the South District Rent Reduction Meeting: No Rent Reduction, No Rent Payment; All Deposits in Banks Starting October; Branch Associations in All Areas Limited to One Month to Organize <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to New Voice Society, the Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee has established over 200 branch associations since its establishment last year. Besides those that have reached settlements, over 100 are still working hard. Therefore, representatives of shops and residents in Nanshi, such as Shen Xinfu, stated that while a few active branch associations have achieved rent reductions again and again, those who do not understand the procedures or act alone in requesting rent reductions not only fail to obtain rent reductions but also win themselves lawsuits. This is not beneficial to society in the long run. Therefore, on the 16th, they held a representative meeting of the Nanshi district's businesses and residents' rent reduction movement at the Shaonian Yi Jiang Guan, proposing to promote the establishment of rent reduction branch associations in all lanes and blocks of Nanshi within one month. Before obtaining a clear order from the Sixth Plenary Session, the following items will be temporarily implemented. After being approved by the entire meeting, it was submitted to the South District Rent Reduction Committee for implementation. The committee specially invited representatives from the city's rent reduction efforts yesterday afternoon. Attendees included Zheng Jianbo, Standing Committee Member of the Joint Rent Reduction Association of Various Districts; Hu Yibo, Standing Committee Member of the Zhabei District; Zhang Binghua, Standing Committee Member of the Pudong District Association; Zhu Wenbo, Standing Committee Member of the Huxi District Association; and Shen Xingu, Executive Committee Member of the Nanshi District, and over 50 others. Shen Xinfu, Zhu Tiwu, and Yang Qiqing were publicly elected as the presidium. After performing the rituals, the following matters were discussed: (1) Resolutions submitted by the representative meeting of businesses and residents in the Nanshi district. It stated that although rent reductions, both voluntary and involuntary, are heard of daily in the Nanshi District, the problem has not been thoroughly resolved. How should it be promoted to complete the universal rent reduction plan? Resolution: Send a letter to the South District Rent Reduction Committee, requesting it to send representatives to participate in the Shanghai City Rent Reduction Petition Group and go to Beijing to petition the Sixth Plenary Session. Before obtaining a clear order, the South District Committee will notify all branch associations in the South District to follow the following resolutions: (1) Each rent reduction association will investigate each household. Those who have not yet organized must organize within one month. (2) All disputes or lawsuits arising from rent reduction issues before this meeting should be reported to the local rent reduction association for legal assistance. (3) Those who feel that the rent is high and request a reduction must not default on rent due to rent increases before a resolution is reached. Rent arrears before October are not subject to this rule. Starting from October, all rent payments should be suspended, and the rent should be deposited in a bank. The methods and procedures will be designated by each association for handling. (4) If second landlords profit from leases and undermine rent reductions, subtenants within the same address may jointly request rent reductions and lower rents. (5) In this economic downturn, with the fall in commodity prices, reducing rent is an urgent matter. When initiating rent reductions in various areas, residents must not obstruct or resist the overall resolution due to kinship or friendship with the landlord. If the above facts occur, it should be submitted to the assembly for punishment. (6) Those who request rent reductions without the regulations of the Rent Reduction Committee and the resolutions of the plenary meeting of each location, and act alone, thereby hindering the overall interests, all overall losses should be fully compensated by the individual acting alone. The resolutions were duly recorded and approved for strict implementation. (2) Report on the housing case of Liang Yi Fang in Xicang. After investigation by this committee, the rent is indeed higher than the surrounding areas. Although the landlord has already expressed a 10% discount, it is still not fair. A resolution should be requested. Resolution: Send a letter to the landlord, requesting him to express to the tenants within five days that he will voluntarily reduce the rent by 20%, otherwise, according to the tenants' wishes, permission is granted to suspend payment and file a lawsuit. Approved. (3) Resolution on determining the address of the Nanshi District Association of the Rent Reduction Joint Association. Resolved: Temporarily at Wu An Elementary School, Qinglian Street, Nine Acre Land. (4) The branches of Minguo Road, Xinhua Road, Fangbang Road, and Zhaojiabang Road are requested to hire lawyers Zhou Lianze, Zhu Yakui, and Wang Liwu as legal advisors to the branches. Resolution passed. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e113">National Goods Groups Collect Samples of Products <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Xia Pu County, Fujian Province, in order to promote national goods, has launched the establishment of a national goods exhibition hall and sent a letter to the China General Federation of Industry requesting it to collect products on its behalf. The federation has sent letters to its members and factories, stating: "With the opening of seaports after the White Opium War, foreign goods flooded in, absorbing cash. Not only has the commercial arena suffered, but it has also affected rural bankruptcy. In recent years, national goods have been exquisitely made, practical, and affordable. Compared with imported goods, they are no less inferior. However, they have failed to reduce the record-breaking surplus of customs. The reason is that consumers do not recognize national goods and misuse foreign goods, and producers fail to publicize their goods to the best of their ability. As a result, even with national goods, foreign goods are still used, or due to traffic obstruction, the supply and demand of production from various places cannot be balanced. There is a surplus of national products here, and similar foreign goods are used there. In view of this, the Association plans to organize a national goods exhibition, sending separate letters to major domestic factories, soliciting samples or specimens of various products, in order to promote them. We know that your association is the highest industrial organization in the country, so we hereby send this letter and request you to check and forward the purpose of our association to your members, and we hope that you will provide us with samples or specimens of various products, indicating the type, price, month, and description as much as possible. We will widely introduce and publicize them, and we look forward to your reply." According to the meeting, a corresponding letter was issued immediately, and it was announced that it should be checked, verified, and sent to the Association for collection and transfer. The matter concerns one's own interests and should not be delayed. The China National Products Manufacturers Association yesterday notified all its members and factories, saying: "For the purpose of notification, according to a letter from the China Youth Using National Goods, 'Since the opening of our country to the sea, due to the decline of industry, countless amounts of money have flowed out every year, resulting in great economic difficulties for the people. In recent years, although the authorities and those concerned about national affairs have regarded the huge amount of money flowing out as sufficient to harm the country, they have spared no effort in promoting national goods. However, our country has a vast territory, and there are many places with inconvenient transportation, and cooperation between production and sales is difficult to popularize. The colleagues of our group, in view of this, plan to go to all parts of the country and to the residences of overseas Chinese in Nanyang to expand publicity, with areas with inconvenient transportation as important publicity sites. The publicity method is to hold exhibitions of national product samples in various places, and to collect samples in various places, introduce each other, and investigate the sources and specialties of all daily necessities of the people in various places, for the research and adoption of industrialists. However, at the beginning of the process, we must rely on the guidance of national goods groups and industrial experts. We are responsible for being the leading agency in the national goods industry, and we should be fully aware of the national goods factories. For the convenience of collection, we specially send this letter to your association to collect samples of completely national goods, so that they can be taken to various places to introduce to the public, and to provide guidance.'" Accordingly, it is hereby notified that if manufacturers wish to have the group introduce them, please send samples to the association immediately, and indicate the capital, the source of raw materials, the manufacturing situation, whether Chinese workers are employed, the purpose, and the history of the enterprise, so that they can be collected and handed over to the group to be taken to various places for publicity. This is a special notice.</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Telephone Company Does Not Cancel Toll Fees, Two Reasons Are Difficult to Establish <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Both Parties Can Re-Negotiate the Contract, and the Lines Can be Re-equipped.</p>
<p>If the Interests of the Public Are Taken into Account, Cancellation Should Be Expedited</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession, in response to opposition from all parties to the five-cent toll fee, requested the cancellation of the fee. The company specially issued two reasons for not canceling it: (1) Due to the temporary telephone contract, it is not convenient to change it midway, and this toll fee must continue to be collected. (2) Due to the different structures of the two-way automatic telephone exchanges, it is not convenient to dial directly, and the current manual switching method must continue to be used. A reporter from New Voice Xiang consulted relevant parties for their opinions, and they expressed the following: (1) The temporary telephone contract was signed by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, the Ministry of Transportation Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and the Shanghai Telephone Company. The current Telephone Bureau and the Bureau of Public Utilities, for the convenience of public transportation, both advocate the cancellation of this toll fee. This has been reported in various newspapers. Furthermore, the Telephone Bureau has already provided telephone users with 40 free calls per month for Type A users and 80 free calls per month for Type B users. If the Shanghai Telephone Company can also take public interests as a premise, then with the consent of both parties, this toll fee can be cancelled. (2) The automatic switch installed by the Shanghai Telephone Company is a rotary type, and the automatic switch installed by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau is a step-by-step type. Although the structures of the two switches are incompatible, a changing machine line can be added between the two-way lines to replace the current manual station. Then, users of both parties can dial directly. Moreover, the manual station requires hiring drivers. If direct dialing is used, this expense can be saved. After the improvement, not only will the public benefit, but the company and the Telephone Bureau themselves will also be able to save more on the monthly expenses required to maintain the calls. The Ministry of Transportation Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company in the concession have repeatedly discussed the cancellation of the five-cent toll fee in the Chinese concession. However, because the telephone company used the telephone contract and the different machines as excuses, no concrete measures were taken. Chinese users have also requested the Bureau to realize the cancellation as soon as possible because the Telephone Bureau has not been able to completely cancel the fee.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Postal Savings Bureau Allocates 200,000 Yuan to Organize Agricultural Product Loans in Changshu; Operations Are Scheduled to Begin Next Month; Warehouse Base is Undecided and Rented Civilian Housing Temporarily <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation plans to promote the development of rural economic prosperity in several provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, and has successively established loan agencies in Kunshan, Wujiang, and other counties to handle various loans and pledges for agricultural products and rural side businesses in order to regulate the economy. Since its opening, it has achieved remarkable results. The Bureau has taken into account that Changshu is a well-known rice-producing area, with an annual autumn harvest of more than 1.5 million shi. More than 500,000 shi also pass through from neighboring counties such as Jiangyin and Wuxi. All industries and businesses in the county rely on rural areas to maintain themselves. In recent years, disasters have frequently occurred, and the domestic economy has been absorbed by cities, resulting in the depletion of the rural economy. In order to regulate the livelihoods of farmers in the county, a loan agency and an agricultural warehouse were specially established. Previously, Secretary Wang Zhijing was sent to Changshu to inspect and contact financial circles and rice industry groups such as Wang Yaowen and Lu Gongquan. After returning to Shanghai, Wang reported the findings of the investigation to Director Shen Shuyu for review and processing. The Bureau has already allocated 200,000 yuan in savings as a loan fund and started to prepare for the establishment of a loan agency, which will be implemented next month. As for the agricultural warehouse, because the base has not yet been surveyed and construction will take time, it has been decided to temporarily rent civilian housing for application. In the future, after the formal opening, the development of Changshu agriculture and the adjustment of farmers' economy will surely benefit greatly.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Oil Cake Manufacturers in Various Places Strive to Abolish Bran Tax; Chairman Chen Ziyi of the Association Said That if It Is Not Abolished, He Will Sacrifice His Business <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, since the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of Guangdong Province implemented the additional tax on bran on September 1, oil cake manufacturers in various places, as well as merchants from Shanghai, Shantou, and Guangdong, have been suspending business and shipments for nearly two months without a resolution. Yesterday, it was reported that the Political Affairs Committee had decided to continue collecting the bran tax at the original rate of two jiao and five fen per dan. The reporter visited Chen Ziyi, the chairman of the Oil Mill Association, to inquire about the manufacturers' attitude. According to him, the case of Guangdong Province levying a bran tax is really unreasonable. At a time when the central government is abolishing harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies and alleviating the suffering of the people, the Political Affairs Committee suddenly added a bran tax. Although the Association and other associations, together with representatives of the municipal Chamber of Commerce, have petitioned various authorities in the central government and telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee to request its abolition, Guangdong has not yet given an official reply. In order to protect their own business and the livelihoods of workers, the manufacturers continue to strive for it. If Guangdong Province clings to its prejudices, disregards the difficulties of industry and commerce, and does not abolish it, the manufacturers plan to sacrifice their business as a whole at the last step.</p>

<h3 id="e123">The Ministry of Industry Asks the Municipal Government to Ban the Sale of Water-Containing Damp Tea; A Reward Will Be Granted for Moisture Content Below 30 Percent <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government received a notice from the Ministry of Industry, Commerce No. 37567, stating that the letter from the Secretariat of the National Economic Commission, "The plan of the Commission to revive the tea industry originally included improving the quality of tea. In recent years, Chinese tea has always had a burnt taste, which has led to a sharp decline in quality. It is often criticized when sold, and the price is low. The most taboo of tea is the burnt taste, which has a great impact on the sales of tea. The reason for the burnt taste is that the raw tea contains too much water. Therefore, the sale of damp tea should be strictly prohibited. It is proposed that the Grand Office send a letter to the Ministry of Industry, ordering all tea-producing provinces in the country to strictly prohibit damp tea. The sale of any raw tea with a water content exceeding 45% should be prohibited, and a reward should be granted for moisture content below 30%." The letter also stated, "Please submit the letter for review and handling. In addition to replying to the letter and sending copies, please also consult with the responsible officials and ask them to comply."</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks the Ministry of Finance to Pay Attention to the Case of Rough Stone Penalties at Customs; Cases Where Penalties Have Been Executed Are Penalized Again; There is No Such Law, Whether Criminal or Administrative Penalties <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "In the matter of the request, on the 3rd of this month, this Association received a directive from the Ministry's Customs Letter No. 7307, stating that the General Taxation Department had submitted a reply on the handling of the Chen Kaiqing Rough Stone case in Shanghai Customs, and a copy of the original submission was attached. It was ordered to be informed, etc. When the Association received the original submission, it forwarded it to Chen Kaiqing for information. Now, it is learned that the merchant has forwarded a copy of the objection submitted to Customs, requesting assistance. As this case has been submitted by the merchant to Shanghai Customs, it is not necessary to submit a direct appeal to the Ministry at this time, procedurally speaking. However, there is one crucial point in this case that must be stated. Chen Kaiqing's rough stones transported to Shanghai for sale are no more than the scope of underreporting the price, as stated in the sections submitted by the General Taxation Department. In other words, it is only one case. According to the principle that one matter should not be tried again, the case has been executed. After the execution is completed, a new penalty is imposed, regardless of whether it is a criminal penalty or an administrative penalty. There is no such law, which opens a precedent that has never existed before. The imported goods that have been taxed and released as cited in the original submission of Shanghai Customs can still be inspected by Customs at any time, which is also inappropriate. This clause clearly states that the goods that have been taxed can still be inspected at any time, not that the case that has been punished and completed can still be inspected and penalized. The two situations are different and should not be compared in a crooked way. In short, in the Chen Kaiqing case, the various arguments in the objection letter are a clarification of the facts, and the Association need not say much. The principle of not trying a matter again must not be destroyed by any means. Otherwise, the rights of the people will always be in an uncertain position. This is the main point of the case and must be brought to the attention of the Ministry. As for the disposition issued by Shanghai Customs, no reason for the disposition was given. If the merchant had not received the copy of the submission forwarded by the Association, it would have been impossible to raise an objection. This is another example of Shanghai Customs' failure to fully comply with the legal procedures. It is appropriate to attach a copy of the original objection letter and present it for the review of the Ministry.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Jisheng Society Remits the Third Batch of Disaster Relief Funds to Hankou <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Eighth District of the E Province of the China Jisheng Society's Tianmen Disaster Relief has been completed. A total of 1,036 disaster relief tickets have been collected, including 5,741 large denominations and 2,715 small denominations, totaling 72 dan, 4 dou, and 9 sheng of disaster relief rice and 77 dan, 6 dou, and 9 sheng of broad beans. This has been previously reported. Recently, Hou Yongde and Zheng Shouchang, the chief of Tianmen Disaster Relief, and Gu Yabin, sent a letter reporting that on the 10th of this month, Gu Yabin, Liu Xingben, Wu Youqing, and others investigated nine locations including Xiaozili Nantang in the 16th bao, 14th bao, and 5th bao of the first district, distributing more than 230 tickets. On the 11th, they investigated 14 locations including Xinjiekou Qingyunguan in the 5th bao, 6th bao, 13th bao, and 12th bao, distributing more than 270 tickets. They immediately released and redeemed them with our office. On the same day, Gu Zheng and others went to the disaster area of Jiaowan Ziqianziyi in the 5th district to inspect and release. In the above two districts, a total of 5,576 disaster relief tickets were distributed, totaling more than 15,430 large denominations and more than 7,690 small denominations. There are still places in the two districts that have not been investigated due to silt and soft obstructions, making both boats and land inconvenient. They will wait until the 5th district is completed before detouring to investigate. The first batch of disaster relief funds of 6,000 yuan remitted by your association is planned to be used to designate 5,000 yuan for the 5th district, and the remaining 1,000 yuan will be used to supplement the 1st and 8th districts. However, the funds are small and the disaster is severe, making it difficult to distribute. Is it possible to increase the disaster relief funds so that more people can benefit, etc. After receiving the report, the association realized that the disaster relief funds were insufficient, and in desperation, made a meager effort. The third batch of 1,000 yuan was remitted yesterday by the Siming Bank to Ji Guozhen in Hankou, who will forward it to Hou Yongde to purchase beans and rice and distribute it in moderation.</p>

<p>The election of two directors from the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, with 400 rickshaw puller electors participating in the election, has been drawn. The original date for holding the directors' election was scheduled for the 21st of this month. However, during the meeting of the Public Works Department's board of directors on Tuesday of this week, the chairman of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee proposed that the method of electing the rickshaw puller directors should be slightly modified, and proposed that the Taxpayer's Association for Chinese should send another notice to each Eastern husband elector, delaying the election date by three days so that there would be sufficient publicity in advance, and the names and registration numbers of each elector who had been drawn should be announced in the newspaper. Jiang Yiping immediately represented the election inspectors, and Yu Heqing spoke in favor of using publicity methods to prove that all electors had been generally notified, and to avoid the possibility of delayed delivery of the notification letter. Later, the board of directors resolved to approve the changes to the election method.</p>

<h3 id="e129">National Goods Market Opened Yesterday: Held at the Central Auditorium; Yuan Lvdeng Raised the Flag and Unveiled the Plaque <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai North Sichuan Road Hengbang Bridge National Goods Market, after preparations, held its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Central Auditorium. The ceremony was presided over by the prominent figure Yuan Lvdeng, who raised the flag and unveiled the plaque. The ceremony was grand. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Those present yesterday included Sun Yu of the Chinese National Goods Association, Fan Tianjin of the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, Ye Qichang of the First Special District Citizens Association, and over two hundred guests from various circles. After Chairman Yuan Lvdeng performed the ceremonial rites, he first reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly that promoting national goods is one of the principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nation-building program. Although there are many ways to save the country, it is essential for everyone to use national goods in order to make the country rich and the people strong. Mr. Zhou and others, seeing the influx of foreign goods and the decline of the people's livelihood, initiated the organization of this market in Shanghai to give the citizens of Zhabei a full understanding of national goods. He hoped that the guests present would vigorously promote and purchase national goods as much as possible, in order to block the leak.</p>
<p>Preparatory Process</p>
<p>Liu Chunfan then reported on the preparatory process, stating briefly that the market in this city has been in preparation since the middle of last month, and it has taken more than a month to get it ready after many twists and turns. The original opening date was set for the 15th of this month, but it was delayed for another three days due to fire safety issues. Now it is completely ready. In terms of fire safety, in addition to the fire brigade of the Fifth District stationed on-site for protection, dozens of fire extinguishers are also prepared to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Flag Raising and Unveiling</p>
<p>After the report, the flag-raising and unveiling ceremony was held. Guided by the military band, Yuan Lvdeng walked slowly to the front of the market, first slowly raising the Blue Sky White Sun flag, and then unveiling the curtain, opening the gate, and announcing the ceremony. The crowd outside the gate surged in, and the manufacturers immediately began business.</p>

<p>Qiao Yin, from Yixing, 29 years old, had been working as a small worker in the engine room of the Yitai Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. He and his wife lived in Room 11, Lane 4 of the mill's worker quarters. His wife also worked in the mill as a female worker. Both husband and wife had jobs, and their lives were relatively comfortable. At 10:30 yesterday morning, when he was working, he temporarily ran out of cold water and went upstairs to fetch water. He casually closed the engine. Unexpectedly, the lower level was unusually slippery, and he fell, suffering serious injuries on the spot. He was rushed to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 3:20 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Telephone Committee Decides on Telephone Rates: Will Not Exceed Existing Rates; Report to be Completed and Submitted to Municipal Council Next Week <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Chinese, British, American, and Japanese experts of the Municipal Council's Telephone Committee have been working intensely in recent days. At 10:30 AM yesterday, the four experts held another meeting at the Municipal Council. According to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter's investigation, the result of yesterday's meeting was quite satisfactory. The experts had quite different opinions on the most important issue of telephone rate increases. The focus of yesterday's meeting was the rate increase issue. During the meeting, each expert expressed very detailed opinions, and Mr. Hu Ruixiang, a Chinese expert, especially made many efforts to negotiate and argue on the rate increase issue. Therefore, as a result of the consultation, the opinions of the experts have gradually become consistent. It is heard that the amount of the increase will not exceed the existing telephone rates, that is, 13 yuan for business telephones and 8.40 yuan for residential telephones. The report can be completed and submitted to the Municipal Council next Monday or Tuesday. The rate increase matter still needs to be finally reviewed by the Council's Standing Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Italy Eagerly Needs Eggs; Chinese Factories Have No Goods to Supply: Increased Exports are Not Credible <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, previous reports stated that Chinese egg factories, due to the tense relationship between Italy and Abyssinia in Europe, Italian merchants specially purchased eggs in China for shipment to Italy, resulting in a large export of Chinese dried eggs. Yesterday, reporters inquired about this with egg industry and egg merchant circles in Shanghai. According to manufacturers familiar with the industry, there are many Chinese egg factories, but the largest exporters are Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou, followed by Qingdao. The dried eggs, dried egg yolks, dried egg whites, and frozen egg yolks produced by egg factories are mostly produced in the spring. In the autumn, fresh eggs are in greater demand by residents in the interior, and egg prices increase, so egg factories generally stop production during this period. The goods sold overseas are those produced in the spring for sale. Normally, nine-tenths are sold to the United States, and the rest are sold to Europe. As for Italy, the quantity is very small. This year, due to the Italo-Abyssinian War, Italy urgently needs eggs, but Chinese egg factories can be said to have no goods to supply. As a result, the price of dried egg yolks alone has increased by about one-tenth due to the lack of goods, and the export volume is not large. Exports from Shanghai are even less than those from Tianjin. In short, in recent years, exporters have found it increasingly difficult to export Chinese eggs due to high tariffs and increased costs. The previous rumor that Qinhuangdao intended to use ships to transport Chinese eggs for export, and that egg products from Tianjin and Shanghai were increasing exports, is not credible.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Global Catholic Church Holds Mission Day: Shanghai Catholic Churches Will Expand Publicity Tomorrow <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The third Sunday of every October (i.e., tomorrow) is the Catholic Church's Global Mission Day. On this day, universal believers assist in the promotion of missionary work through three methods: prayer, publicity, and donations. This year, Archbishop Salotti, President of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, will deliver a broadcast speech in multiple languages on the Vatican Radio Station. Anyone in the world with a shortwave radio can hear it. The first broadcast will be at 6:00 PM on Saturday, the 19th, with a wavelength of 19.84 meters. The second broadcast will be at 2:40 AM on Sunday, the 20th (all Shanghai time), with a wavelength of 50.26 meters. All Catholic churches in the city have been ordered by Bishop Hu to conduct expanded official publicity tomorrow. In addition to religious ceremonies, donations will be collected at the entrances of various churches to help the poor and disaster-stricken missionary areas. The Catholic Church on Nansun Road in Hongkou will also have a donation group composed of Chinese, British, American, Portuguese, French, and Japanese young ladies collecting donations in front of the church. The Yangjingbang Catholic Action Association issued an official statement as follows:</p>
<p>It has been nineteen centuries since our Lord Jesus completed the great work of redemption. Although the Holy Church has relied on the tireless efforts of the apostles, bishops, and priests, who have crossed mountains and seas, undeterred by dangers, it has reaped rich harvests. Thanks to the sweat and blood of many heroic missionaries, the gospel of salvation has spread to the five continents. However, most people have not yet heard the gospel, and even entire nations are immersed in the darkness of foreign religions. Therefore, the souls of hundreds of millions of people cannot be redeemed, and the precious blood of the Savior seems to have been shed in vain for them. Now, missionaries around the world, more than 19,000 priests, more than 9,000 assistant brothers, and more than 51,000 nuns, constantly appeal to us from the vast missionary areas, asking us to replenish their strength so that they can advance the cause of the church and save many souls, sharing in the grace of redemption. We must know that in order to cultivate native clergy, a lot of funds are needed. Those who preach the gospel also need a minimum of living expenses. The construction and maintenance costs of all churches, schools, hospitals, nurseries, orphanages, and homes for the elderly are also very large. These funds are received by the Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith from offerings from believers around the world, and after centralized control, they are distributed to various missionary areas. If the organization lacks generous donations from believers and donations decrease day by day, then the missionary fund loses its guarantee, and tens of thousands of missionaries lack assistance, and the cause is difficult to develop, and may even have to stop. The current Pope said that as long as one missionary is forced to stop working because he cannot get the economic assistance we can provide, it is a major responsibility. Therefore, on this annual Mission Day, we must generously donate to meet the material needs of the missionaries, and in our prayers, in the Mass, and after receiving Holy Communion, we must fervently pray for the missionary cause, so that there will be abundant harvests, the Holy Church will flourish, and the Kingdom of the Lord will come to the world.</p>

<p>Zhang Xiaoruo, Chairman of Dasheng Cotton Mill and General Manager of Dada Steamboat Company, after being assassinated and killed the day before yesterday, his eldest daughter, Fei Wu, had the body transported to the China Funeral Home on Haig Road. Zhang Jingli, Zhang Xiaoruo's cousin, telegraphed the Zhang family in Nantong and dispatched a special ship to Nantong to welcome his mother, who arrived on the afternoon of the 17th. His wife, along with his children, Rong Wu, Can Wu, Rou Wu, Fan Wu, and Xu Wu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and are now staying at their residence on Lafayette Road. Representatives from all walks of life in Nantong arrived in Shanghai yesterday to offer condolences. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter paid a special visit to his brother, Zhang Jingxian, at the China Funeral Home to inquire about the results of the French police's investigation into the case. According to him, the French police authorities said that the case is under strict investigation and has not yet reached the stage of release, so the inside story is unknown. As for the condition of his concubine, Guangci Hospital announced that she had passed the danger period yesterday and had been moved to a different room for treatment. Although her spirit is numb, she sometimes cries out in pain, so there is no danger to her life. It was also said that his wife was almost overwhelmed with grief after arriving in Shanghai. The funeral has been scheduled for 10:00 AM this morning. As for where he will be buried in the future, it has not been considered yet. As for the duties of Dasheng Cotton Mill and Dada Company, they are currently being handled by agents, and all matters will not be suspended as a result. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e135">China Foreign Relief Association: Disaster Relief Work is Tense; Expanding Publicity to Encourage Donations; Winter Relief to Begin Soon <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since its internal approval and registration 15 years ago, the China Foreign Famine Relief Association has been conducting disaster relief affairs throughout the country and other rural construction work with extraordinary seriousness, and its performance has been quite remarkable, and it has been praised by people across the country. According to the director of the association's Shanghai office, Mr. Yu Zaoshi, the society's reporter said that all the fundraising donation books for this Jianghe Famine Relief have been internally stamped with bells for fundraising, and the results are very optimistic. However, many donations are mistaken for the Yang Yi Relief Association, so many donations are sent to that association. In fact, this society is the China Foreign Famine Relief Association, not the Huayang Relief Association. As for the future work of this society, after Director Zhang returns to Shanghai this time, he can start to handle the Jianghe Winter Relief. However, in recent circumstances, in addition to assigning a special person to report on the Jianghe disaster situation in various schools in Shanghai this year, he will immediately solicit donations. Fudan University has also sent a letter to this society, inviting it to send personnel to give a lecture on the 21st. This kind of effect is also extremely satisfactory. Caricrow Company, Milllnton Company, and Huamei Tobacco Company in this city have donated dozens of locations for disaster relief billboards in the British and French Concessions for this society and posted tens of thousands of disaster relief advertisements for this society on their behalf. Yongtaihe Tobacco Company and Huacheng Tobacco Company have also donated the cost of this society's disaster relief advertisements on public buses in the Public Concession for two days.</p>
<h3 id="e136">High Court Prosecutor Appeals Yi Fangshuo's Not Guilty Verdict <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, head of the Fangshuo Spirit Troupe, a Hangzhou native who performs comedic song and dance dramas at the rooftop playground of the Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road, is 44 years old. He was previously charged with raping his cousin. The French police arrested Yi Fangshuo and brought him to the Second Special Court. During the investigation, it was also found that Yi bought women to learn opera and monitored their actions, which constituted the crime of interfering with family freedom. After prosecution, regarding rape and disrupting public morals, the plaintiffs Ye Baozhu and Li Xiaozhen requested withdrawal of the case. As a result of the trial, Yi was found guilty of interference and sentenced to three years in prison. He was found not guilty of interfering with family freedom, and the charges of disrupting public morals were not accepted. He was ordered to be held in custody pending instructions. Yi was not satisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. As a result, the verdict was changed, the criminal law clauses were amended, and the original sentence was maintained. Yi again appealed to the Supreme Court, which finally revoked the original verdict and sent the case back for retrial. The Third Branch of the Court opened a trial on September 17 of this year and concluded on the 21st of the same month, acquitting the defendant. During the appeal period, he was allowed to be released on bail pending summons. Yi was detained in the detention center for ten months. After being released on bail, he first went to Hangzhou to take care of family affairs and then went to Suzhou for sightseeing. He did not return to the Xinxin Company to perform again until the first day of this month. The details have been published in the newspapers. Now it is learned that the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court has expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict of acquittal in Yi Fangshuo's retrial and has submitted a written statement of reasons to Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, appealing to the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Supreme Court in Nanjing. It is not known how the Supreme Court will rule on this retrial appeal in the future.</p>

<p>Mrs. Zhang, the wife of Han Fusheng, who lived at No. 10 Chongde Lane, Zhaozhou Road, Nanshi, was in her thirties. Due to a long-term illness of paralysis, she obtained a folk prescription of herbs from Nanxiang. She swallowed it the night before last, and died at 7:00 AM yesterday. The local headman reported it to the Ximen Public Security Bureau, which sent the herbs to the Health Bureau for testing to see if they contained any toxic substances. The court was also notified, and Prosecutor Zhang was dispatched to inspect the body at 3:00 PM yesterday. He ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Young Woman from Sian Town, Zhejiang, Jin Jinfeng Abducted and Sold; Raped in Shanghai but Fortunately Not Sold; Three Abductors Arrested, Three at Large <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Jin Jinfeng, 20 years old, wife of Weng Tianming, a farmer from Panjiashan Village in Sian Town, Zhejiang Province, was lured by Old Woman Dong from the same village on the 25th of last month to Shanghai to be sold. She was first raped by Pan Jinyuan (aka Little Nanjing) for two nights and planned to be sold at the Tiger Stove entrance on Xieshi Road, Nanshi. Shen, the squad leader of the Detective Squad of the Ximen Public Security Bureau, and Deputy Squad Leader Luo received a secret report and immediately ordered their subordinates to investigate on Jumen Road. They brought Zhang Xiaomao, the female abductor, and Jin Jinfeng, the abducted woman, to the bureau for interrogation. First, Zhang Xiaomao confessed that her husband, Shen Genfu, Xiao A Dan, Xiao Nanjing (i.e., Pan Jinyuan), Zhu Fugen, Four Eyes, and others led Jin Jinfeng to be hidden in the house of Four Eyes. Today, her husband and Xiao Nanjing called her to Four Eyes' house to take her out, and they were arrested. Jin Jinfeng, the abducted woman, confessed that she was 20 years old, from Panjiashan in Sian. Old Woman Dong from the same village often said that Shanghai was a good place and persuaded her to come together. On August 25th, Old Woman Dong first took her to Taizhou and stayed for eight days, and then entrusted her to someone else to take her to Shanghai. She was not familiar with the road and let them take charge. She had been raped by Pan Jinyuan (aka Little Nanjing) for two nights. Her husband's name is Weng Tianming, 18 years old, and lives in Panjiashan, about two miles from Sian. After hearing the confessions, Squad Leader Shen dispatched detectives to arrest Pan Jinyuan and Four Eyes, who were related to the case, and strictly pursued Old Woman Dong, Shen Genfu, Zhu Fugen, and others who were at large. Since the case involved abduction and rape, the abductors Pan Jinyuan and Four Eyes, the female offender Zhang Xiaomao, and the victim Jin Jinfeng were all sent to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Embezzling Relief Funds for Gambling; Attempted Suicide by Poisoning, Rescued; Qin Tinghou Prosecuted by Police <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Bian Yichen, Qin Tinghou, and others from Ningbo jointly invested 2,000 yuan to open the Shenji Chemical Supplies Store at No. 11 Jinyu Lane, Edward Road. Bian served as the manager, and Qin was responsible for purchasing and sales. Last month, Qin sold 2,400 yuan of chemical supplies and did not hand over the relief funds to the relief office. Instead, he issued four checks from Tongyuan Bank, Municipal Bank, and other banks on this month's date to the relief office as a stopgap measure. From that day on, Qin did not go to the store to work. He went to the dog racing track to gamble every day. Within a few days, he was out of money. Because he could not make up for the loss, he had the idea of committing suicide. On the night of the 15th of the month, he went to Room 133 of the Xinya Hotel on North Sichuan Road and secretly took a large amount of opium to commit suicide. The tea boy discovered him and had him transported to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He Suizhen, the Chinese detective of the Laozao Police Station, learned about the matter and requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant, and then transferred Qinshan Tongren Hospital to the Municipal Council Hospital for treatment. He has now recovered. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the previous situation and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Bian Yichen also hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to attend the court with a civil suit. Qin Tinghou admitted that he had used a total of 2,200 yuan since August and was now trying to raise money to repay it. He also hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him and requested bail. Because there was no shop to provide bail, he was ordered to be released on bail to Lu Pengling, a friend of the defendant. The court approved it and scheduled a retrial for one week later.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Gu Zhuxuan's Sentence Not Pronounced Yesterday: Because Several Points Still Need Further Investigation; Retrial Scheduled for the 22nd <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Stage from Yancheng, known as Boss Gu Si, 50 years old, was recently accused by Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Tingzi, and other criminals in the case of the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, on June 18, 1933, of instigating the murder of Tang. They met with Gu in Room 208 of the Asia Hotel on Edward Road beforehand, and Gu handed them a pistol and promised a reward of 10,000 yuan after the matter was accomplished. The French Police Department requested the Second Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. At noon on the 10th of last month, Western Detective Grell (transliteration) led Chinese detectives, together with detectives from the Public Concession Central Police Station, to No. 9 Yonghe Lane, North Xizang Road, and arrested Gu, bringing him back to the police station and transferring him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. After investigation, the Police Department filed a public prosecution for the crime of instigating murder in accordance with Articles 29 and 271 of the Criminal Law. Gu hired three lawyers, Xue Dubi, Wu Kaisheng, and Lin Dawen, to defend him, denying the instigation and accusing Zhao and Zhang of extortion and false accusations. Court President Wang Gangxu, together with Assessors Xiong Huiping and Zhang Chaozuo, and Prosecutor Wang Ren, specially opened a joint collegiate bench on the 12th of this month to conduct an inquiry and interrogated prisoners Xue Zhenyi, Zhu Jincheng, Liu Yimin, Wu Shaoting, and others for testimony, declaring the end of the debate and setting a date for sentencing. During this period, Court President Wang convened a meeting of the assessors this Wednesday for the sake of caution to deliberate on various matters. The details have been published in the newspapers. Because Court President Wang, Xiong, and Zhang, who are hearing the case, felt after the meeting that there were still some unclear points in the case that needed to be further examined in detail in order to avoid injustice, yesterday was the originally scheduled date for sentencing. From 1:30 PM, the police continued to send Chinese and Western detectives and a reserve team to protect the court area, and maintained order in the court together with the bailiffs in the court. More than a hundred family members and friends of Gu who came to the court to listen sat quietly in the audience waiting for the verdict. At 2:30 PM, Court President Wang still came to the Criminal Court One with Assessors Xiong and Zhang and Clerk Zheng. Lawyer Fei Xizhen of the Police Department appeared in court, and lawyer Xue Dubi, the defense lawyer of the defendant, and lawyer Wang Shizong, the private prosecution agent of Tang Youmei, the victim's family member, also arrived on time to wait for instructions. The court ordered the bailiffs to bring the defendant Gu Zhuxuan into court. After briefly inquiring about his age, address, and occupation, he immediately informed the defendant that the Police Department's prosecution of your murder case was originally scheduled for today's verdict. Because there are still a few points in the case that need to be further investigated and examined, the sentencing will not be possible today. The closure of the debate is revoked, and the retrial is scheduled for 2:00 PM on Tuesday, the 22nd of this month. After the announcement, Gu Zhuxuan was taken back into custody by the bailiffs.</p>

<p>Huang Chongxiu, a woman from Sichuan who is nearly forty years old, met Zhu Pangu, who opened the Far East Film Company, through an introduction this spring, and then lent him a thousand yuan. At that time, Zhu wanted to create the Xiaoyao Dance Hall and raise shares from Huang. Huang invested 2,000 yuan and also transferred the 1,000 yuan previously lent to him as share capital. However, the Xiaoyao Dance Hall was not profitable for long and lost money. Therefore, Zhu sold the dance hall, and Huang believed that Zhu's behavior was fraudulent. Recently, she sued him in the First Special District Local Court. The trial had been opened once, and it was reported in the newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide continued to open the court. The defendant came to the court with his defense lawyer. The plaintiff, Huang Suxiu, through her agent lawyer, stated the facts of the loan to the defendant after they met, and the process of recognizing shares and jointly opening the dance hall, requesting that the investigation be conducted in accordance with Articles 339 and 342 of the Criminal Law. The defendant, Zhu Pangu, confessed that the Xiaoyao Dance Hall was a partnership between him and the plaintiff, Jiang, Mr. Jin, and others. It started business on May 18, with a total share capital of 5,500 yuan. The plaintiff recognized 2,000 yuan of shares. In addition, the one thousand yuan was borrowed from the plaintiff by him personally. Unexpectedly, after operating until June 23, all the capital had been lost, leaving only five yuan and change. He immediately invited all the shareholders to discuss, and they were all unwilling to increase their investment, so they decided to close the business. Someone wanted to take over the business, so they transferred it, obtaining a transfer price of 4,000 yuan, which was used to repay all debts. There was a transfer agreement, which was certified by lawyer Zhou Yongding, and the plaintiff was also very agreeable at that time. Now, she suddenly dissents, accusing him of breach of trust and fraud, causing great damage to his reputation. Therefore, he also filed a counterclaim against her for false accusation, requesting that the case be brought to justice and punished. Judge Feng ruled that the evidence still needed to be investigated and ordered a retrial on the afternoon of the 25th of this month.</p>

<p>Regarding the robbery case at the North Sichuan Road General Post Office, after the Dixwell Road Police successively arrested eight suspects including Wu Kong the monk, Qiu Guobin from Funing, and the woman Wang Chenshi, on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, Judge Jiang Shuzi specially opened the Third Criminal Court for investigation and trial, postponing the hearing to next Wednesday afternoon. Details have been reported in this newspaper. From 2:00 AM to 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, the Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the case, based on the confessions of the arrested Wu Kong the monk, Qiu Guobin, Wang Chenshi, etc., continued to arrest three more accomplices at the Sun Bridge, Singapore Road in Zhabei, and Foch Road in the Public Concession: Zhou Yaoshi (also known as Zhou Er Mazi), Liu Daosheng, and Ji Wenbin from Funing. They were taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that the three defendants were all involved in the post office robbery case and requested their detention and joint trial at a later date, presenting the arrested Wu Kong the monk, Qiu Guobin, and Wang Chenshi to identify them. According to the defendant Ji Wenbin's confession, he came to Shanghai from his hometown in May of this year (lunar calendar). Previously, at a certain place in Hongkou, a Mr. Liang, who is now at large, invited him to discuss the matter. Liu Daosheng was also present. He did not go to the robbery. Afterward, Mr. Liang received 300 yuan and returned to his hometown. Liu Daosheng confessed that he had a long-standing feud with Ji Wenbin due to a dispute over ear pulling and that he was being falsely accused. He claimed he knew nothing about the post office robbery and asked for leniency. Zhou Yaoshi confessed that he met Wu Kong the monk while smoking opium at Yanzi Nest. Later, Wu Kong visited his tiger stove teahouse on Sun Bridge twice. Although he knew about the post office robbery, he did not go to the robbery. Afterward, someone told him there was 150 yuan to be delivered by Liu Xiaosizi, but he never received it. His remaining statements were evasive. According to the arrested Wang Chenshi, in July of this year, Zhou Yaoshi came to her house and asked Liu Xiaosizi about the robbery. When questioned, Zhou denied it.

<h3 id="e145">Dayuan Salt Manufacturing Company: Shareholder Lawsuit Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for Next Friday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhijie, a once-prominent official in the early Republic of China, recently raised funds to establish the Dayuan Salt Manufacturing Company in Yangzhou. His Shanghai residence is located at No. 18 Liang Yu Li, Weihaiwei Road, in the Public Concession of this city. In recent years, due to a lawsuit with shareholder Shen Kunhe, disputes have arisen repeatedly. Shen also filed a criminal self-accusation against Wang, alleging embezzlement of large sums of company funds and breach of trust. The First Special District Court has repeatedly held hearings and summoned Wang for questioning. Wang initially claimed illness and repeatedly failed to appear. He recently surrendered himself and confronted Shen, each holding to their own version of events. Shen then requested the retrieval of the company's account books, but Wang has not yet handed them over. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ma Shide held another hearing, summoning both the plaintiff and the defendant for further investigation. After the facts of the various allegations made by Shen were heard, he ordered the start of the debate. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated in his indictment that in January of the 20th year, the company was approved to increase the price of each dan of salt by 2 jiao, but the increase was not recorded in the accounts until August of that year. Furthermore, the litigation costs incurred by the company in the lawsuit amounted to as much as 5,500 yuan, and Mr. Ma was owed a large sum of money that was not recovered. He especially criticized the defendant, saying that salt prices were always determined by the government, and salt merchants never suffered losses. The company should have been profitable, but due to the defendant's private interests and corruption, it incurred losses. Furthermore, the defendant failed to register the company, so the voting rights still entailed partnership liability. He said he hoped that the defendant's mismanagement would be revealed in order to ensure that the judgment would be accepted by both parties and reiterated his request to retrieve the company's account books for detailed examination. Next, the defendant's lawyer defended against each of the allegations, refuting them one by one. Finally, he said that the plaintiff really wanted to obtain a position within the company, but when his plan failed, he initiated this lawsuit out of disappointment. Judge Feng then declared the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for next Friday afternoon. If he deemed it necessary to investigate the account books, he would order them to be retrieved for review.</p>

<p>The entire cast of the Shanghai Theater recently performed the musical drama "Xi Shi" at the Xindu World Theater in the capital, winning unanimous praise from the people of the capital. The day before yesterday, when they were about to leave, Zhong Wei Yet Chu Tou hosted a banquet at Minghu Chun to offer condolences and rewards, with Fang Zhi, Luo Gang, Zhang Chong, and representatives of various literary and art groups in the capital accompanying them. The theater originally planned to go directly from Beijing to Hangzhou at the invitation of the West Lake Lianhua Theater, but because the China Cultural Construction Association decided to invite the National Games athletes to watch the entire play "Xi Shi" tonight, the entire troupe was recalled to Shanghai yesterday.

<h3 id="e153">Tianli Light Gas Factory: Concentrated and Dilute Nitric Acid Officially on the Market <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Tianli Light Gas Products Factory in Chenjiadu, this city, was founded by Wu Yun Chu of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory and others. It adopts the method of fixing atmospheric light gas, and the raw materials used are only air and water. This is an emerging industry during the European War. During the European War, the blockade of the coast of Chile cut off the source of Chilean nitrate, but the country was still able to support itself for several years, and gunpowder and explosives were not lacking, which was solely due to this method. Most of the various products made from this are necessary for the chemical industry and the military industry. There is currently no second factory of the same kind in the country. After the sale of various types of ammonia last month, business was booming. At the moment, various concentrations of nitric acid have also officially entered the market. Furthermore, because salt brain (i.e., ammonia chloride) is the main raw material for the telecommunications industry, the factory has cooperated with its sister factory, Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, to manufacture it in large quantities. The Ministry of Transportation's tender for a large quantity of salt brain was also due to the factory's products being of high quality and low price, so it was decided that the factory would supply them entirely.</p>

<p>Since the fundraising group of the Flood Disaster Relief Association requested Dr. Mei Lanfang to perform at the Huangjin, the sale of seats has been very satisfactory. However, the originally agreed-upon period for the performance has expired. Although various parties have retained the performance for continuation, Mei has had no opportunity to rest a little after returning from abroad, so his spirit and physique are both uncomfortable. Mei has repeatedly declined, saying he needs to rest for a while. Mr. Zhang Huiru and others from the local famous ticket circles have gathered many male and female amateur performers to participate as guest stars tomorrow, which is the last day of Mei's performance this time, to show their enthusiasm. The local celebrities Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin will both personally take the stage to perform together. Such a grand event is not easy to come by. The people of Shanghai are truly fortunate!

<p>The Higher Examination this year has added a type of Senior Postal Service Examination, with Postal Regulations listed as a subject in the second test, which is a subject that candidates must test in.

The book is now published and covers all postal regulations, with a comprehensive and complete coverage. The content is divided into two categories: organizational regulations and business regulations. Organizational regulations include six types: Postal Regulations, Postal Law, Postal General Bureau, and Savings and Remittance Bureau Organizational Law. Business regulations include twenty types: Savings Law, Domestic Remittance Law, Simplified Insurance Law, Long-Distance Bus Transportation of Mail Rules, Subscription to Publications, Purchase of Books, Postal Telegrams, and Postal Aircraft and Passenger Return Rules.

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in your esteemed newspaper's "Letters" column on the 15th, the report about the conflict between the Wusong Defense Corps and the barber industry leading to a strike, claiming that the facts are inconsistent, and requesting correction, we were greatly surprised upon reading it. We hereby present several points for clarification: (1) The Defense Corps collectively referred to the thirty or so thugs on Taixing Road who were fighting each other. Why not state the cause of the incident and completely erase the facts? (2) Since Ban Wei Yang Zixiang is the plaintiff, he should be interrogated at the Wusong Police Station and not allowed to turn himself in. Moreover, Yang Zixiang is a squad leader of the Defense Corps and was injured. This is obvious to any discerning person. (3) Regarding the second arrest being deemed illegal, why was there no prior statement of the merchants' criminal activities? Furthermore, during the arrest, the entire armed force was mobilized, divided into squads, and searched each merchant's store, creating a menacing atmosphere as if facing a major enemy or capturing big gangsters. However, at that time, all the shops in the town were still open. Therefore, the public witnessed everything. Whether it was legal or illegal, let the public judge; there is no need for the merchants to waste their breath. Merchants have always known that your newspaper's principle is peace, and your columns are precious, so we did not fully disclose the entire process.

<p>— (Tie Wu)</p>
<p>Dreams are extremely sweet, and at the same time, extremely bitter; sometimes one dreams of sweetness never before encountered in life, but sometimes one also dreams of bitterness never before experienced in life.</p>
<p>You say someone is dreaming; others say you are dreaming. Without him saying it to you, and you saying it to him, "We are all dreamers."</p>
<p>Even iron men, when placed in nitric acid, will slowly corrode. Therefore, great heroes throughout history, when reduced to a state of sorrow, are always helpless.</p>
<p>When people are happy, it is best not to forget the bitterness. "Forgetting the pain once the scar is healed" and "Drinking today's wine today" are both extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Poppy flowers are extremely beautiful, but also extremely poisonous. Using them as a metaphor for a beauty is indeed a fitting example.</p>
<p>A friend who, when you are annoyed, can refrain from revealing your not-so-public secrets is a good friend.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Beggar with Ten Thousand Pounds <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>

<p>In a town called Cha in Portugal, a beggar often appeared. He was blind, and his face was well-known. According to him, he was penniless and suffering. Now, he has been accused of faking blindness to swindle money and has been taken to the authorities. It turns out that his eyes are bright, but he deliberately pretended to be blind, begging for sympathy. After a lifetime of hard work, he accumulated ten thousand English pounds. The reason he was discovered is also strange. There is a small town called Mour, a scenic spot on the coast of Portugal, which is very suitable as a summer resort, but because there are no hotels in the town, tourists are hesitant to visit. The local officials originally planned to build one, but they were troubled by insufficient funds, so they put the matter aside. The beggar was born in the town. One day, he suddenly visited the local official and offered to donate five thousand pounds to build the hotel, turning the desolate town of Mour into a prosperous tourist destination, and he was willing to personally supervise the construction. When the local official heard this, he couldn't help but laugh, thinking that the beggar was mentally ill, and revealed a sarcastic tone, which immediately angered this guest. He took out a checkbook from his pocket, indicating that he was indeed the owner of ten thousand pounds, and also proved that he was not blind but had sharp eyesight. The authorities were very grateful for his generous donation, but at the same time, they had to detain him because he had been pretending to be blind for thirty years, swindling people's money. After the news spread, the whole town was very surprised, but because this person was hardworking and thrifty, accumulating a lot of money, not for his own enjoyment, but sacrificing it for public services, so they all expressed sympathy for him, thinking that even if he was convicted, he might be elected mayor when he was released from prison!</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Happiness of the Dead <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Yigu</p>
<p>In order to visit a friend at a rural primary school near Horbilan Road in Western Shanghai, I started from Nanshi and traveled a long distance to Zhaofeng Park. After arriving at Zhaofeng Park, I walked westward along Bailinan Road, laboriously reaching Horbilan Road. When I asked for the location of the primary school, I crossed Lincoln Road. The roadside was lined with trees, and the crops on both sides had ripened. As I walked and looked around, I arrived at a place with a colorful crepe signboard in front of the gate. Looking up, I saw the words "×××× Water and Land Dharma Assembly" written on it. Yellow cloth knots were adorned in front of the cement archway, and there were three doors leading inside. Driven by curiosity, I stopped and stood there. I asked a fruit stall next to me, and I learned that this was "Yong'an Cemetery." Because I had never visited this place before, I swayed my body and strolled in. I thought to myself: The happiness of the dead in these graves surpasses that of the refugees in the flood-stricken areas.</p>
<p>Hey! It would have been better not to go in. Once inside, I saw countless tombs in various shapes:饅頭-shaped, square, flat, and many others. There were marble tombs, and there were also white stone tombs. Stone tablets were erected in front of the tombs, engraved with portraits, elegies, or brief biographies, all luxurious and magnificent, truly worthy of being a city of tombs, a paradise of tombs. There were adults, and there were also children. I also saw many women crying bitterly in front of a tomb, their voices mournful, deeply touching my small heart.</p>
<p>I asked the gatekeeper, and I learned that the so-called Water and Land Dharma Assembly would last for seven days. The expenses were donated by wealthy people. Eighty monks were specially invited from a mountain near Subo.</p>
<p>On the way to my friend's school, I thought: The flood victims in the disaster areas are suffering from hunger and cold, waiting for rescue. Who knew that the dead in Shanghai have such immeasurable happiness? It is truly a contradictory thing that the living are not as good as the dead!</p>

<p>Episode 20: Striving to Save Her Grandson, Holding Each Other and Weeping; Recalling Pillars in a Year of Famine, Sowing Wheat Provokes Disaster</p>
<p>But at this moment, an inquisitive person emerged, wanting to find out what was going on. This was none other than Madam Zhou Yourong, the wife of the inflexible magistrate. She had come from Tongguan to accompany her husband and felt a great interest in everything in Xi'an. At this point, the matter of Madam Jia had already stirred up the entire inn, and she was watching the excitement in the crowd. When they went into the room, she still refused to give up and sat on a chair in the hallway, watching for any changes. After a long time, they remained silent, and Madam Zhou became impatient. She pushed open the door curtain, leaned half of her body inside, and asked: "Hey! Why are you not saying anything? If you don't speak, Mr. Jia will return, and you will have no opportunity." The old lady and Zhu Hushi and a woman dressed in an Eastern style walked in, presuming she was the wife of a wealthy man, they all panicked and stood up without knowing where to place their hands and feet. Madam Zhou waved her hands at them and said, "It doesn't matter; please sit down. My surname is Zhou, the wife of Magistrate Zhou. I only heard that you were saying something pitiful, so I came to inquire about your situation. What are you planning to do?" Yue bowed slightly, not knowing whether to offer her a seat, and lowered her head, saying: "Thank you for your concern. I have already sold myself to someone, so what else can I plan? I can only listen to others." Old Lady Zhu sat on the edge of the bed, looking at Madam Zhou, wanting to say something, but she lifted her sleeve and wiped her eyes, interrupting her words. (343)</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Fragrant Shadow of the Imperial Incense <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Furthermore, the kang where the Empress Dowager was lying was not particularly special, except that the soft felt underneath was thicker than usual. In winter, three layers were used; in spring and autumn, two layers; and in summer, only one layer was used. This was probably because she was old and more afraid of the cold. The silk blanket covering the soft mattress was naturally extremely delicate and was changed every two or three days. Except for the summer, there was always a stove lit in her palace, burning more intensely in winter and more weakly in spring and autumn. At night, after she went to bed, regardless of the day, one of us eight female officials had to stay by her bedside. Outside in the corridor, regardless of sunny or rainy days, winter or summer, there was a group of eunuchs, standing motionless and silently, serving her.</p>
<p>Ah! These scenes, even as I think about them now, are as if I saw them just yesterday! What makes me doubt is why the Empress Dowager, who was so famous throughout the world, held such immense power, and controlled the life and death of hundreds of millions of people, was ultimately just a mortal human being. She also had to eat, wear clothes, and was just like ordinary people. She also had to wash herself—although the washing method was slightly different, wasn't the result the same, just removing the dirt from her body? All of this is enough to prove that she was still just a woman!</p>
<p>Furthermore, her senses were no different from ordinary people. She generally liked to rest and liked to bathe. Especially during bathing, when four palace maids used their skilled techniques to scrub her clean and tender skin, she clearly had considerable pleasure. (439)</p>
<h3 id="e170">Gathering Wild Chestnuts <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Shapa</p>
<p>Tens of miles of mountains stretch out, covered in fluffy thatch. Several tall pine trees stand tall on the mountainside. A waterfall like a white chain pours directly from the stone crevices on the mountain peaks to a large pond at the foot of the mountain. In the crystal-clear blue water, a dozen black-backed fish swim around looking for food.</p>
<p>In the autumn season, the thatch is interspersed with many green burrs, which are wild chestnuts. Although the size of the wild chestnuts is several times smaller than those that are artificially cultivated, they taste particularly sweet and glutinous. The large ones are truly like Tianjin Liangxiang chestnuts. In our small village, we are surrounded by mountains, so there are quite a few wild chestnuts. The people who gather wild chestnuts are all teenage girls who carefully cut the chestnut burrs, being careful not to let the thorns prick their fingers. When they return home, they use a board to roll off the thorns and peel out the wild chestnuts, accumulating a large basket. Then, they put them in a pot to stir-fry them, bring them to the street to exchange for copper coins, about three copper coins for a small cup, which is great for children to pass the time. If you buy some raw ones and peel the meat to make a bowl of glutinous rice, it has a unique flavor.</p>
<p>If we carefully consider it, how much trouble do the village girls go through to exchange the wild chestnuts for copper coins? Recalling the various things in society, which one can be obtained easily without any effort? Therefore, as people, we should also work hard at our careers so that we can have a comfortable life later.</p>

<p>Ballad singers simply recite scripts passed down from their masters; occasionally adding a joke is considered improvisation. They are not necessarily required to have any talent before they can be popular. In today's world, there is Wei Yu, who possesses literary talent and can improvise and sing on the spot, naturally elegant and harmonious. In the ballad singing world, there is no match for him since Ma Rufei. His unsurpassed masterpieces include The Pearl Pagoda and Second Plum Blossom, which have captivated countless gentlemen and ladies in Jiangnan! Literary figures such as Qi Fanniu and those with elegant reputations such as Shen Anguan and Xue Xiaoqing are all his disciples. And Mr. Wei is getting old! At the beginning of this month, Mr. Wei was invited by the City God Temple to sing Second Plum Blossom, and the seats were filled every day; gifts were presented as souvenirs. A Mr. Zhou presented him with a couplet written by Zhang Zhenglü: "Don't refuse to sit down for another song, listen together to the master's Second Plum Blossom." The cursive script was bold and flowing. The lines flowed seamlessly, like a dialogue. Mr. Wei has poetry in his heart and knows how to appreciate it. With his special skill, he is never short of genuine appreciation. Isn't the spiritual comfort that Mr. Wei receives even greater than the nourishment of food and clothing?</p>
<h3 id="e172">Random Talk About Goldfish <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Many friends have asked me: Why do our goldfish, which are quite large and lively, die one after another after being kept in a very spacious glass tank for not long? The water is changed every day, and they are fed. Sometimes they eat it all, sometimes they just float on the surface of the water, constantly gasping. Changing the water helps a little, but in the end, not a single one is left.</p>
<p>I dare say that glass tanks are simply not suitable for raising fish; they can only be used for temporary keeping. Generally, a glass tank with a diameter of one foot, filled with eight-tenths of water (preferably with some old green water), can only hold three or four fish that are about an inch long. Give them some red worms to eat once a day. If it is not easy to get red worms at home, rice grains or porridge will also work, but they must be small and the greasy liquid must be washed away first. Also, do not give too much. Then expose them to sunlight for one or two hours. Change the water once a week, and they will not have any problems. If there is too much fish droppings at the bottom of the tank and it looks unsightly, there is no need to rush to change the water. Simply use a "suction pipe" to remove the dirt. At the latest, do not change the water for ten or eight days. As long as they do not float to the surface, it is okay. If the fish are large and the tank is small, they will not last even half a day. As for changing the water, both well water and tap water are acceptable, as long as they have been left on the ground for a week before use. This is called boiled water. Changing with boiled water has no stimulation on the fish's body. Therefore, it is best to use boiled water to change the water.</p>
<p>The above words are from actual experimentation and can be said to be the method of raising goldfish in Shanghai apartments. If you raise fish in this way, there should be no other problems.</p>
<p>These days, the autumn is clear and crisp, and many people are visiting Caohejing. Especially on Saturdays and Sundays, Guanshengyuan Farm is very lively. Therefore, the goldfish business is not bad. Those who go to buy want old fish that are three or four years old. So recently, more than a hundred fine old fish have been added from the Suxi area. There is also a type of pompon fish produced in the north. Two months ago, a manager from a Tianjin Guanshengyuan branch came to Shanghai, and I asked him to look for some large pompon fish after he returned. Fortunately, a quick letter came a few days ago, and he specially sent a fish farmer to bring thirty or so colorful pompon fish and large red pompon fish to Shanghai by train. Upon inspection, I was shocked. They were incomparably large. The pompoms on their heads were as big as two longans. They looked very good. They cannot be found in Shanghai. Soon, we will hold a "Fish Exhibition" of famous breeds from the north and south to invite celebrities from all walks of life in Shanghai to appreciate and evaluate them.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Tense Currency Exchange Market: Gold Price Rises Endlessly. Though Many Sell, There is More Demand Than Supply.

<p>Yesterday, the gold market opened weakly. Unexpectedly, the surface was tense, and the currency market was depleted. Major players such as the Guangdong group vigorously sought US dollars. Although there were attempts to sell remittances, the demand exceeded the supply, and the price broke through the 50 yuan mark. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw British silver contract while American silver remained flat. It was rumored that the market would stabilize after closing and that the US would continue to buy. Montreal forward silver prices slightly contracted by 1.5 to 1.7 li.

It was anticipated that HSBC's posted exchange rates would show British rates flat and American rates rising by 1.25. At this time, there was still a correction. As the mainland and other parties strongly sought US dollars, excitement arose. However, banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, leading to a decline. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong group worked hard to secure US dollars for December, selling remittances. However, because banks were not selling smoothly, demand in the market was strong. As a result, the currency exchange market became increasingly tense, and the gold market continued to rise. Major players purchased aggressively. Sassoon also bought forward shillings, finally breaking through the 50 yuan mark. Only then did many parties begin to offload their positions. It was predicted that Indian silver would only rise by a small anna, and the price quickly turned back down. At noon, public sentiment was still stable, hovering within the 50 yuan range. The later market was expected to rise as Shanghai supplemented US dollars, and the currency market remained strong, gradually rising and breaking through the 50 yuan mark. However, because of the sale of remittances by many parties, there were many trades in the middle. The initial report for Indian silver showed no change, and then a rise of one anna. After that, the price suddenly rose to a high of 955 yuan. However, banks took advantage of the high prices to supply silver, and Chinese merchants also stabilized their positions, and the market gradually turned peaceful. The second report from Indian silver showed a rise of one anna. Many parties made settlements, and selling interest became active, retreating into the 50 yuan range.

<h3 id="e178">Rumors of Conflict Between Britain and Italy Cause Stock Market Tremors <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Stock Exchange initially struggled to rise with the support of the financial community. However, as a direct conflict between Britain and Italy seemed unavoidable, bullish investors sold off, and the market situation remained shaky and unstable. Rumors persisted, and the environment was unsettled. Even with support and rebound, the strength was limited, and no one was willing to sacrifice in this environment. Judging from the market situation, although securities numbered 48 and 54 were trading actively, the pressure from security number 10 was also significant. Therefore, the outlook remained difficult to be optimistic. Throughout yesterday, the market seemed stable at the opening in the morning, with a decrease in trading volume. The market price fluctuations were also minor, roughly. Presumably, short sellers, aware of the support from the financial community, did not dare to sell rashly. Market prices showed both gains and losses, but the number was only about 0.1 or 0.2 jiao. In the next round, the financial community again made a push, strongly lifting the market. The gold contract for this month rose sharply by 0.7 jiao, and other contracts also rose uniformly by 0.3 to 0.5 jiao. In the afternoon, the situation initially remained firm and bullish. The long-term 19 recovery contract was strongly pushed up by as much as 0.75 jiao. However, the strength of the bullish investors gradually weakened, and the gains became smaller and smaller, with positive six contracts slightly losing about 0.1 jiao. Then, evening news reported that Britain and Italy were about to engage in armed conflict, causing a sudden panic. Retail investors sold off. Market prices were initially stable, then weakened, and finally major investors took advantage of the situation to exert pressure. The price of positive six contracts for this month fell sharply by 0.85 jiao. Overall, most market prices still rose by 0.1 or 0.2 jiao to 0.7 or 0.8 jiao, with only 23 passes and positive six contracts down slightly by 0.2 or 0.3 jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 20 million yuan. The comparison of the resulting gains and losses is listed on the left (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that yesterday (17th), the New York stock market, due to the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy, the situation became serious, causing the market to want to rise but stop. Recently, leading stocks all sold off, with steel and railways declining. Pack automobiles traded quite actively.

<p>The yarn market's rising trend is increasingly sharp, bid prices steadily increase, rumors of currency inflation are particularly rampant, coupled with the Osaka Sampin yarn prices tending to soar, the market situation appears even more robust. However, market transactions are sparse, and sales of spot yarn have turned dull again, likely due to exchange rate constraints.</p>
<p>Gold Rooster Rises Another Dollar</p>
<p>In the early session of the yarn market, prices for all months showed a slight downward trend, and the market appeared unusually sluggish. Rumors persisted, but after the third round of bidding, things gradually turned around. Due to strong bid prices and tight raw cotton supplies, the yarn market, which is closely linked, was drawn into a high range. However, due to a lack of transactions in the market, prices for all months rose by six, seven, or eight jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. Upon opening in the afternoon, it was heard that the bid price had reached over 950 yuan, strengthening market sentiment further. Run Kang and Tong He suddenly came to buy, and a certain Australian firm was preparing to take delivery this month, further boosting the market. Moreover, Osaka Sampin yarn prices rose steadily, intensifying buying interest. As a result, prices for all months rose by two, three, four, or seven jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Ming De sold 750 bales, Sen Kang 350 bales, Shen Chang 350 bales, Chang Yu 300 bales plus 10 yuan for 400 bales, Mao Huai Mei Ji 1,200 bales, Tai Chang 300 bales, Run Kang 1,800 bales, Da Fu 500 bales, and Tong He 2,050 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 249,200</p>
<p>Actual Sales Reduced to 300 Bales</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn are sluggish. It was found that total purchases by all groups throughout the day amounted to 302 bales, and market sentiment was calm. The trading volume of each group is as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 108 Shantou 50 Guangdong 29 Jiangxi 10</p>
<p>Changsha 5 Ningbo 3 Nanjing 5 Sichuan 2</p>
<p>Sichuan 85 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>The cotton market's rising trend is becoming stronger, entirely influenced by the increase in bid prices, stirring market sentiment. Speculators are covering short positions, but overseas cotton market conditions are flat. It is reported that this month, the cotton inspection office has approved about 10,000 dan of cotton, with goods being Tonghua, Yaohua, and Dongtai cotton.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Floating Empty Covering</p>
<p>In the early session of the bid cotton market, prices for all months were calm, and the market remained stable. After the third round of bidding, it was heard that the gold market was still good and supply was dry. Market prices advanced slowly. As a result, prices for all months rose by one jiao to one and a half jiao, or three jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market atmosphere remained brisk upon opening in the afternoon, with bid prices continuing to rise to new highs. Osaka Sampin cotton prices fell by two or three jiao, but local market sentiment remained high. Chang He and Shen Chang again came to cover short positions, driving the market higher. As a result, prices for all months rose by five fen to two and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Da Fu sold 1,000 dan, Yuan Yi 2,300 dan, Run Kang 1,700 dan, Yong Da 1,000 dan, Da Fu 900 dan, Sen Kang 1,400 dan, Xie Cheng 1,000 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang 1,300 dan.

<p>Yesterday, upon the opening of the US cotton market, domestic brokers and foreign firms made slight purchases, and market prices did not fluctuate significantly. Transactions were sluggish. Subsequently, short selling resumed, with news uncertain. A certain large broker sold about 30,000 bales of December futures, causing a slight drop in market prices. On the buying side, given favorable weather conditions, there was concern about increased short selling, leading to caution. Near the close, short positions were covered, resulting in a slight stabilization. Current demand activity, according to spot cotton merchants, is such that nine out of ten ginned cotton bales have already been sold. The closing was flat, with spot prices falling by ten points, and futures prices falling by four to seven points. English cotton spot prices fell by five or six points. Indian cotton trading was sluggish, with good current demand offset by long covering. Pingle remained unchanged, Omla rose by 0.75 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by half a rupee.

<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for both near and distant months rose uniformly, as the quoted price of foreign wheat from Chicago and Canada rose by five, six, or seven jiao. The quoted price of spot foreign wheat is seen as expensive, and the quoted price from foreign firms is also slightly high. Although mills have an appetite, they ultimately do not transact due to the high price. The scarcity of local wheat has made the cost of flour high, stabilizing prices. Furthermore, Northern merchants continue to pay for shipments of spot flour, inevitably triggering new hoarding and the covering of short positions. However, after the price increase, there is long covering and mills seek to unwind positions, and rumors persist in the market, causing the market to return to calm.</p>

<p>After the opening of the wheat market, there was no competition between buyers and sellers. Transactions for both near and distant months were few. Except for slight activity in February, most months did not open. Subsequently, due to the rising quoted prices of foreign wheat and high set prices, as well as the tight supply of spot wheat and the recovery of bid flour, prices immediately rebounded in the afternoon sessions. Although transactions were weak, the market turned stable. The closing price was good for two or three fen. Spot wheat owners are still hoping for better prices. A batch of Shandong and other trucked wheat was sold on the market at 4.45 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat at 4.4 yuan, with Fuxin taking 3,000 bags and Xinda taking 4,000 bags, it is said.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources from various gangs, with more than 6,000 shi of goods in total. The sales market on this street was average. The weather was cloudy, and market sentiment was slightly flat. Each thick grade had little fluctuation, and each thin grade had a continuous handling of six or seven hundred packages by Yantai and Qingdao gangs, which was relatively strong. As for *Zhong*, although more than a hundred packages were sold, the arrival of goods was not high, so it also stood firm. *Baige* was similar, only *Houxin* ordinary *Jing* rice was soft by several fen. Different grades of new *Jian* from *Du Yang* and others were different because they accepted selected goods, and the rise and fall differed greatly, and the results were only a few fen up and down. *Yinbian Yuan*, old and new goods were mediocre.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources from various gangs in the river, and the market went down. Because there were few stores on the market, all goods were sluggish. The market price of white broken *Jing* rice and new *Jing* rice was a few fen to nearly a jiao. White *Yuan* was more than a small jiao. Dense type was stable, and *Baige* price was a small jiao. *Du Jian* was weak, and *Yang Jian* and *Bu Jian* prices were a few fen. All other goods were fatigued.</p>
<p>(Guest Xian) Yesterday, arrivals were continuous, and shipments continued from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Yongbo, Gan, Wan, and other ports, but the outgoing roads decreased day by day. The *Ke* gang only had Tianjin to deal with Yongbo's evening rice, 160 packages, and there was no news from others. Part of this street inquired about River Rice, and appetite was even weaker. The market immediately showed a downward trend. Throughout the day, 250 packages of Gan rice, 152 packages of Yongjiang machine early rice, 552 packages of Wenzhou Taizhou machine rough rice, and 240 packages of Han rough rice were sold, all handled by this street. Although the market was similar to the previous market, the core was already soft.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) The floating inventory is exhausted, and the line group is guarding high for resale. Only 100 bags of Siamese rice were handled by this street in the whole city, and the market price has also dropped to 6.3 yuan, it is said.</p>

<p>Foreign sesame was slightly reduced due to rumors in the previous day, and hoarders sold loosely, but Jardine's appetite was very strong, and the sellers unanimously tightened. The market price jumped again. It was estimated that 300 tons were traded yesterday, and the price opened at 9.6 yuan. At the moment, industry insiders estimate that the general trend will continue to prosper. Part of the spot market's sentiment is still soft. Because Dalian City raised soybeans sharply, the local market immediately tightened, and the outgoing exports to factories in the mainland were still unremitting, and the market was stabilizing.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Rises Another Two Jiao <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose again, with the customs gold rising again, and the closing price was 1.870. The trend was steadily tight. The association allocated 24 groups of spot sand white at 18.2 yuan, with a slight transaction, up two jiao. The transit customs warehouse price was 6.1 yuan, with no transaction. Benchang Mianbai Zhen Ji No. 1 was 17.3 yuan, No. 2 was 17 yuan, No. 3 was 16.6 yuan, No. 4 was 16.4 yuan, and No. 5 was 16.2 yuan, all up two jiao. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company issued 1,820 packages of Huizhou medium sand white at 17.25 yuan, 550 packages of No. 2 Mianbai at 18 yuan, and 1,400 packages of secondary No. 2 at 17.5 yuan, all without a transaction. Only 1,000 packages of Dutch coarse white were sold at 18.2 yuan. Dongchi and Dongbai were bid up by one or two jiao, but there was no transaction. Only No. 8 white YT Mark was traded slightly at 18.05 yuan.</p>

<p>The sesame oil market has been affected by high sesame prices and weak inventory, and the owners are unwilling to sell lightly. Yesterday, the Bengbu oil market was raised to 18.5 yuan (previously opened at 15.8 yuan), and 100 dan were traded on this street. There were also 170 dan of road goods sold at a price of 18.2 yuan. The price of raw materials has risen, leading to this dramatic rise after being abandoned for a long time. However, after a big rise, it may attract the attention of new vendors, and the subsequent sources may be endless.</p>

<h3 id="e189">A Huge Crisis in the Current Cultural World <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Zhi</p>
<p>The current cultural world in our country is facing a huge crisis. The arrival of this crisis is not due to the sluggishness of the publishing industry, nor is it due to the general depression of people's hearts. In a word, it is due to the new development of the cultural policies of imperialist countries.</p>
<p>Among all industries in our country, the publishing industry has, for many years, rarely been oppressed by imperialist forces. Like other industries, due to the oppression of foreign capital and the dumping of foreign goods, now nineteen out of ten are struggling to survive. National industries that rose during the opportunity of the European War have almost all fallen into bankruptcy. However, although the publishing industry is sluggish and the current situation is very bleak, it can be said to be detached from the oppression of imperialism. This is due to the existence of a completely different language barrier between them.</p>
<p>Therefore, the cultural policy of imperialist countries towards colonies initially focused on missionary work. The so-called church was also engaged in reprinting Christian classics, which had very little impact on our country's ideology. Subsequently, schools were established through missionary work, but they were still under the control of the church, with limited impact. Until the United States first returned the Boxer Indemnity, using it for education and cultural specialization, which proved very effective. Then countries such as Britain, France, Belgium, and Japan rose up to imitate it. Our country's cultural world became like feudal warlords who divided and ruled, and was divided into many factions due to differences in education and Boxer Indemnity basis. This process from missionary work to school establishment corresponds to the shift of capital imperialism from commodity exports to capital exports. In the stage of commodity exports, the purpose is to promote commodities. In the stage of capital exports, capital is used to invest in colonies, such as purchasing government bonds and securities, and establishing factories to seek profits. Therefore, in the stage of imperialist commodity exports, what is needed are commodity salesmen and so-called new people who use Western civilization products. In the stage of capital exports, it is necessary to further advance and need technically specialized talents. For example, when imperialists invest in building roads, they not only hope to obtain interest from railway operations, but also hope that railway materials and so on can be supplied by them, and that the management of the railway can be controlled by them. Here, people who have received their education are needed.</p>
<p>Until recently, the cultural world in our country was in such a situation. But we know that the policy of capital imperialism towards colonies does not stop at the export of capital. It also wants to further make the colony subordinate to its own country politically, economically, and culturally. This is the process of the vast China from a semi-colony to a divided colony. Unfortunately, our destiny now has to embark on the first step of this process!</p>
<p>Now, not to mention the political and economic situation, just in terms of the cultural world, we can clearly see that because of the oppression of imperialist forces, we can no longer speak freely, and even our textbooks and our history must be modified. But will the imperialists stop there? No! Like Soviet Russia, in order to promote its doctrine and communize China, it had compiled Chinese textbooks and other reading materials, and had also published many Chinese newspapers and magazines. Imperialists will inevitably come up with this set of tricks. Imperialist Chinese newspapers and Chinese magazines already exist. The textbooks edited by bookstores opened by imperialists themselves will certainly be published soon. At that time, I ask, can the capital strength of our country's publishing industry compete with them? In this way, our publishing industry, which has always been detached from the oppression of imperialism, will inevitably be hit by its dumping and fall into a desperate situation.</p>
<p>Or it may be said that even so, as long as our intellectuals do not cooperate and unanimously resist, what use will imperialists have even with their strong capital and power? But I dare to ask if this is possible? We must know that the general intellectuals in China today are proud to be close to foreigners, and the general psychology of society is that those who can interact with foreigners are high-class. The current situation is such that it is only that the imperialists do not use us. If there is any need, I am afraid that Chinese intellectuals will be eager to climb the dragon gate.</p>
<p>Do readers doubt my words? Then please look at the facts before you. Are those who divided the Boxer Indemnity not our country's so-called celebrities and scholars? And the so-called experts, are their research reports mostly using Western languages instead of being disdainful of using their own Chinese? Furthermore, the current so-called scholars, even though their writings are in Chinese, are they not sent to foreign printing houses or foreign publications and then distributed by foreign bookstores? Relying on the power of imperialism, they can occupy a high position in society, be respected by the general public, and also avoid the inspection of the government and freely publish their remarks criticizing the country, giving people the impression of being daring heroes. Who would not want to be such a traitor?</p>
<p>Since things have reached this point, this is the cultural elimination of China. If we do not make plans now, I am afraid that we will regret it too late!</p>
<h3 id="e190">A Readable Book <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Zeng Jianping</p>
<p>The Land Tax System in China's Medieval Period, written by Liu Daoyuan, printed by New Life Bookstore</p>
<p>In recent years, although China's publishing industry has paid a little attention to the problems of China's social system itself due to the debate on social history, the recent works that can make individual expositions and analyses on the historical facts of Chinese society are still a minority of minorities. Especially more specialized works on the issue of land tax are as rare as phoenix feathers. This phenomenon has become clearer to me in the past few months.</p>
<p>Liu Daoyuan's "The Land Tax System in China's Medieval Period", although not a specialized big book, although it only takes the land tax system of China's medieval period! That is, the period from the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the first year of Zhongping of Emperor Ling of the Eastern Han Dynasty to the An Lushan Rebellion in the fourteenth year of Tianbao of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty, as its research object; But this book of his, in its methodology and in the materials, is still a readable book.</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>First, it is because the method used by Mr. Liu Daoyuan in this book is completely different from the method used by Chen Dongsheng and others. He does not regard China's land system or tax system as an isolated phenomenon. On the contrary, he regards them as social phenomena restricted by the productive forces at that time, and studies them according to the class relations within this phenomenon. He does not simply lay out the facts of past history with a philological attitude, but wants to "show" the "relationship between the rulers and the ruled in the rent and taxation" at that time through his research.</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of methodology, this book is readable.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the division of social classes, Mr. Liu's work also has unique insights. That is: he not only lists this medieval stage as a special stage, but also points out that this stage is a self-sufficient production of manors, which is characterized by "the standing opposition of state manors, large clan manors, and temple manors, and the state relies on military farming or equal land distribution to subordinate the serfs under it, occupying most of the land, and establishing a powerful royal power over the large clans and temples"; And he further pointed out that the characteristics of taxation in this century are completely different from the taxes before 1804 ("Two Han Dynasties and earlier") and after 755. Because the taxpayers before and after the Middle Ages were commercial capitalists and large landowners; While the Middle Ages were generally strong aristocratic giants and temple monks. The change of the land tax system is one aspect of the class opposition relationship, but Mr. Liu can solve the mystery of the social stage to which the Three Kingdoms to Tang belonged from one aspect." Such a point of view is much higher than the opinions of the so-called scholars who generally lay out historical facts.</p>
<p>Therefore, from this point of view, we also believe that his work is a readable book.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Liu Daoyuan's book is also very appropriate and measured in the use of historical data. For example, when we compare the chapter in which he discusses "Two Forms of Land in the Three Kingdoms" with the works of Mr. Chen Dongsheng or Mr. Chen Boying, we can see how Chen Dongsheng and others use the historical data at that time, which is how flat, direct and superficial; And Liu's writing can analyze the relationship between the various forms of land ownership at that time from the special form of the land system at that time. All of these are features that Liu's writing does not have in other books. Due to this feature, several people believe that Mr. Liu Daoyuan's work is really a book that the general youth should be familiar with in the period when the problem of China's land system is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>However, according to Mr. Liu's own preface, this small book is still the fourth part of his Outline of Chinese Tax History. For the readability of his works, we hope that his other works will appear.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Bookstore Miscellany (Continued) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>Fifth—Bookstores that Expanded from Running Magazines—They started a publication, found it was doing well, and had a wide readership, so they proceeded to run a bookstore. Examples include New Women to Wenming, New Life Monthly to New Life, Life Weekly to Life, and Dawn Monthly to Dawn. Recently, it is said that the Chinese Rural Economic Research Association and the Chinese Economic Intelligence Agency, due to the popularity of their publications Chinese Rural Areas and Economic Intelligence, expanded and established the Xinzhi Bookstore. Unfortunately, New Life Weekly folded. Mr. Zou is back and planning the New Life Bookstore. "Economic Common Sense" has sold widely due to the advertising effectiveness of the Shenbao newspaper, which led to the creation of the Economic Bookstore. These bookstores can also be classified into this category.</p>
<p>Sixth—Bookstores Expanded from Old Stores—With the rise in popularity of opening bookstores, many old bookstores have also expanded. New life has been injected into old shells. For example, Dadong publishes books on martial arts, law, etc., which is not bad. Suddenly, they collected a large number of manuscripts and established the very beautiful storefront we see today. The rubbings and calligraphy from Shenzhou Guoguang Society are very inexpensive. Suddenly, we see Reading Magazine and a large batch of new books such as Plekhanov. The Minzhi Bookstore is famous for selling Party doctrine books. Under the leadership of Mr. Yang Youjiong, they have also published many new books on international politics and law. The World Book Company is known for Red Rose and Kung Fu Knight-Errant stories. Who knew they would suddenly have many ABCs, and then a large number of university series, middle school series, and many other new books.</p>
<p>Seventh—No, there isn't any more. It's not that there isn't any more. If I add more, it would be repetitive. If you don't mind the tediousness, you can still divide it. At the very least, you can divide out a kind of "inexplicable bookstore." Not long ago, everyone blindly competed to open film companies, established inexplicably, and as a result, closed inexplicably. At that time, there were many such new bookstores. A wealthy old man listened to the instigation of others, took out tens of thousands to open a bookstore, but as a result, it closed down before long. Secondly, recently, important Party and state figures have opened bookstores, or even "semi-official" bookstores have appeared.</p>
<p>Also, yes, there are those "bookstores that take promoting culture as their responsibility" that have not been mentioned yet! But, which are they? Ahmen, we can only say: all bookstores are!</p>
<p>(3) The Capital of Bookstores</p>
<p>The capital of bookstores is not different from the capital of other industries in substance. However, in the collection of capital, there are differences due to the different nature of the investors. According to the ordinary fundraising methods, there are only three types: 1. Sole proprietorship, 2. Partnership, and 3. Company organization. Bookstores are similar. But you must know that the "opening a bookstore" business may be outside the "hundred industries." Not everyone knows how to do it, everyone can do it, and everyone is willing to do it. Therefore, publicly soliciting shares and organizing in the form of a company is not common, except for a few so-called large bookstores such as Commercial Press and Chung Hwa Book Company. If there are any, it seems that only Kaiming Bookstore publicly solicited shares in the newspaper a few years ago. Although other new bookstores also have company organizations, public share solicitations are rare. The reason is not that the bookstores are unwilling to solicit shares, but that even if they do solicit shares, no one will respond.</p>
<p>To know the source of capital for a new bookstore, one must first know how much capital is needed. If you don't mind being too broad, then we can say that as little as tens of dollars to as much as millions are the same. How do you say that? Don't you see that there are many who only print a thin few dozen pages of "books" and establish a bookstore name? Isn't that enough with just tens of dollars? As for millions? That's a bit of an exaggeration, but in reality, the need for capital for a new bookstore is indeed unlimited.</p>
<p>The best strategy for a new bookstore to use capital is to use all capital, except for a part of the necessary expenses, entirely on publishing new books. The development of the bookstore's business is determined by the amount of books sold. To sell more books, there must be more types. In this way, the bookstore's need for capital is endless. Because, for example, the cost of publishing a book is two hundred yuan. Once the book is published, the two hundred yuan must be paid in full (it is a different matter if the bookstore intends to make the printer and author "eat bad debts"), but the book cannot be sold out immediately. Even if it is sold out, it is not certain that all the money can be recovered. Therefore, the more new books published, the more "dead capital" is invested, the more inventory, the more bad debts, everything is "more," and the less working capital. Therefore, except for a few large bookstores that have reached their peak (?), emerging bookstores, especially those in the process of development, are constantly seeking new capital. Today, none of the bookstores on Fourth Malu Road in Shanghai do not feel a lack of working capital. This cannot be entirely blamed on the sluggishness of the new book industry. A part is still due to the "capital structure function" of the bookstore.</p>
<p>Therefore, the source of capital for each bookstore and the methods of obtaining it have to come from the following channels:</p>
<p>First, sole proprietorship. There are several types of sole proprietorship. Some are bookstore owners who operate the bookstore themselves and invest their own money. Most of these bookstores are shopkeeper bookstores, and their scale is not large. There are also non-operators who invest. In the past few years, there were quite a few military and political figures and advanced Party figures who, after listening to the encirclement and instigation of general literati, took out tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands to open a bookstore. Many of these bookstores have closed down today, but there are still one or two that, when they run out of money, the investor writes a check, and they continue with one check after another. In the past, some bookstores had no accounts in the business department at all. In one case, when the manager died, the outstanding customer accounts could not be found. Those who didn't know thought it was a joke. If they knew the inside story of how these bookstores raised funds, it would naturally not be surprising.</p>
<p>Second, partnership. This kind of partnership is more common in bookstores opened by literati themselves. A few writing friends gather together, everyone takes out some money, and the bookstore is established. But they don't know that new bookstores need new capital to nourish them from time to time. Literati simply don't have that much money, so they can't continue, and many such bookstores die halfway.</p>
<p>Various interesting methods of raising capital also often occur in this type of bookstore. For example, embezzling authors' royalties as new shares is one of them. Because bookstores opened by literati often have some understanding of books they publish, if someone publishes a book with them, they will say to you: "Half of your royalties will be used as shares to join our bookstore!" In this way, it is nominally increasing new capital. Secondly, to acquaintances, "Old friend, please join us for a share too." After the money is taken, the rent is paid first, or even the salary for the current month of the person who pulled the shares is paid first, until they close the door and everything is auspicious. There are also many cases where the investor has not yet seen the stock.</p>
<p>Third, company organization, but very few of the new bookstores in Shanghai are truly handled in accordance with the Company Law. In addition to one or two large bookstores, many new bookstores, although said to be joint-stock companies, in fact not only do not have official dividends, but also the annual business reports are not seen.</p>
<p>There is also a way to absorb capital, and it is not a very good way, that is, the bookstore absorbing deposits. Among them, the best is the World Book Company. In addition, Kaiming, Children's, etc., also have colleague deposits. The annual interest rate for bank deposits is only seven percent, while the interest rate for bookstore deposits is between eight and ten percent. From the bookstore's point of view, this is better than overdrafting from the bank at nine percent, but in the general decline of the book industry, it is difficult to have a net profit of one percent in business settlement. Therefore, the so-called deposits are actually drinking poison to quench thirst. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(4) Poisoning (Fungi)</p>
<p>Fragrant mushrooms and tree ears are one of our daily edible essentials. Some of them contain toxins, so eating them can cause poisoning. Also, there are those that are not poisonous mushrooms, but are poisonous because the mushrooms have rotted. One must be able to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Those poisoned by mushrooms immediately develop acute symptoms in the gastrointestinal tract. Or frequent vomiting and diarrhea, or abdominal pain, or even strange thirst in the mouth, general fatigue, sweating, thin pulse, mania, drowsiness, and eventually death.</p>
<p>Before the doctor arrives, the following effective measures should be taken. First, induce vomiting. (For vomiting methods, see previous issues). The vomited mushroom pieces should be kept for the doctor to check whether it is true mushroom poisoning. If there is a state of collapse, stimulants should be administered immediately and artificial respiration should be applied to seek a turning point.</p>

<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Those who do not smoke cannot know the suffering of those who quit smoking. The craving for tobacco torments the quitter so that he can neither live nor die. Moreover, when quitting, the body undergoes drastic changes, and all kinds of diseases appear in droves, so it is necessary to use a good medicine to regulate it. Therefore, 生殖素 (Shengzhisu) has become an essential product for regulating during smoking cessation. All those who have received its grace can testify to it.</p>
<p>The smoker, Lu Guozhi, started smoking due to illness. He was deeply addicted to tobacco. Because the national government strictly prohibits smoking, and feeling that smoking was detrimental to both his physical and mental health and career, he decided to quit. However, he suffered from many illnesses during the withdrawal period, which was unspeakable. I extended his diagnosis and treatment and immediately prescribed 生殖素 to regulate his ailments, which disappeared. Before long, the craving for tobacco also ceased. I immediately told him to continue taking several more boxes. Now he hates and rejects tobacco, and his body is strong and healthy. One cannot tell that he was once a hardened smoker.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Treatment of Neurasthenia <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Neurasthenia can be divided into cerebral neurasthenia and sexual neurasthenia. It is generally caused by masturbation, sexual exhaustion, etc. Symptoms often include one or more of nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, etc. Those who suffer from sexual neurasthenia can often induce cerebral neurasthenia, while those who suffer from cerebral neurasthenia do not necessarily suffer from sexual neurasthenia at the same time. However, regardless of whether the ailment is in the brain or in the sexual organs, using ス丹ナ氏氏殖素 (Sudanna Shi Shi Zhisu) to treat it can achieve the beautiful effect of treating both. The following example can prove my point.</p>
<p>The patient, Chen Tianqing, is from Yuyao. He masturbated severely as a teenager, which led to nocturnal emission. After marriage, he also suffered from premature ejaculation. At this point, his sexual nerves were extremely weakened. Due to thin semen and kidney deficiency, his spine and brain marrow could not be nourished, which led to general neurasthenia. Headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, limb tremors, blurred vision, and backaches were endless. Later, he was introduced to my clinic for diagnosis and treatment by his relative, Fu Jun. I treated his neurasthenia with 生殖素 and his nocturnal emission with ヒミ脱氏精片 (Himituo Shi Jingpian). In less than three months, all his ailments disappeared. His whole body felt light, healthy, and full of energy, which he had never felt before.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Nocturnal Emission Caused by Relaxation of the Vas Deferens <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yu Bofu</p>
<p>Those who masturbate have loose and relaxed vas deferens, so semen can easily slip out. Therefore, nocturnal emission is almost unavoidable for those who masturbate. The technique of treatment is to consolidate the essence first. ヒミ脱氏固精片 (Himituo Shi Gujing Pian) is the main medicine for it.</p>
<p>Like Mr. Zhang Dalong, he was seduced by bad friends when he was young, indulged in masturbation, and did not know how to cherish himself. When he grew up and realized this, he had already developed nocturnal emission. Often it occurred more than twenty times a month. His vital energy was depleted, and his limbs were exhausted. He was in great pain. Later, because he was about to get married, he was afraid of hindering his offspring, so he came to my clinic for treatment. I prescribed ヒミ脱氏固精片 to him. After taking more than three boxes, the nocturnal emission was completely eradicated. He also took 生殖素 to nourish himself, and his body was restored.</p>

<p>— Contributed by Tang Jiheng</p>
<p>I have been married for many years, and because my wife suffers from leukorrhea, there is no hope for offspring, which is very painful. I have repeatedly taken various gynecological medicines, but they have not been effective for leukorrhea at all. Later, Dr. Zhou Xiaohan introduced me to use 療帶靈 for external treatment. I used it according to the instructions, and the leukorrhea, which had been considered incurable for many years, was completely eradicated. From this, I know that there are medicines for external treatment that are better than internal administration, such as 療帶靈. Moreover, 療帶靈 is convenient to use and can be treated secretly, which is especially suitable for the environment and psychology of women. Those who suffer from the same disease in the world should know the technique of self-treatment.</p>

<p>— Contributed by Wang Xiaoben</p>
<p>I was ignorant when I was young and contracted the bad habit of masturbation. I did not know how to cherish myself and squandered my essence every day, destroying the foundation of my vitality. Later, I read medical publications and learned the preciousness of vital energy and the harm of masturbation to the body, so I made up my mind to quit painfully and held on with perseverance. Unexpectedly, I often had dreams at night and suffered from nocturnal emission. Afterwards, it became even more severe. Even without dreams, I would vaguely emit semen. During the day, when I urinated, there would also be white, silky semen secreted. It was extremely distressing. Later, I went to Dr. Yu Bofu for treatment. He said that my vas deferens was loose and I also suffered from prostate leakage. He told me to take ヒミ脱氏固精片. After one box, the nocturnal emission stopped during the day and decreased at night. After taking two more boxes, the nocturnal emission was completely cured, pulling me out of the sea of suffering. ヒミ脱氏固精片 is truly the greatest savior for those suffering from nocturnal emission.</p>

<p>The patient, Mr. Zi Jixiang, has always been known as a strongman in the wolf pack. Whenever there is a dinner party with friends, Mr. Yu would wolf down his food, and no one could keep up with him. Mr. Yu's stomach was always healthy. However, Mr. Yu did not know how to maintain his health and finally suffered from indigestion and stagnation due to eating greasy and cold food excessively. Bad breath and constipation arose in droves. Whenever there was a dinner party, he would frown and avoid it, or even not attend. Then, his appetite decreased sharply, he suffered from malnutrition, and his body gradually became weak. He came to me for treatment. In addition to teaching him how to maintain his stomach, I also prescribed the special medicine for stomach ailments, 胃痛靈 (Weitong Ling). After taking about two bottles, his stomach suddenly opened up, his digestion became strong, and his body recovered. However, learning from his past mistakes, he followed my instructions and dared not be reckless again.</p>

<p>— Dr. Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The patient, Shen Kechen, is from Wuzhen. He is 24 years old, but because of congenital inadequacy, his body is still like that of a 17 or 18-year-old child. In particular, his sexual organs have not been fully developed, which he considers to be a great pain. Not only is there a problem with having children, but his wife ridicules and mocks him constantly. He is greatly stimulated mentally, so he came to me for treatment. I diagnosed him with sexual neurasthenia, which was formed due to a lack of internal secretions, resulting in poor nutrition and failure to develop. So, I prescribed the internal secretion preparation "生殖素." After taking four and a half boxes, his body and local parts were well developed. The relationship between him and his wife also became harmonious as before.</p>

<p>There are five of us brothers, and I am the third. I am currently 21 years old. Six years ago, I contracted a bad habit. My brother knew about it and told me about the harms, so I strictly abstained from it. However, I suffered from nocturnal emission, about ten times a month. It has not improved at all. Therefore, my body has gradually become weak. The symptoms include cold limbs, weakness, dizziness, palpitations, backache, insomnia, forgetfulness, fear of fatigue, and exhaustion, etc. Later, my fourth brother also suffered from nocturnal emission and was cured by taking ヒミ脱氏固精片 (Himituo Shi Gujing Pian). I also followed the same method for self-treatment. After three boxes, the nocturnal emission was completely eradicated. Last winter, because I was getting married soon, I sought treatment from Dr. Yu Bofu. In addition to receiving electrotherapy, he also told me to take 生殖素 internally, about four boxes. My ailments disappeared, I gained weight, and I was full of energy. These two medicines are truly the greatest saviors for youth diseases.</p>

<p>(Submissions must include detailed address and postage for reply)</p>
<p>Tinnitus and Back Pain</p>
<p>Hu Changbiao asks: I have a weak constitution and often suffer from tinnitus and back pain. I plan to take tonics in the autumn. I don't know which tonic is the best. I would be grateful for your guidance.</p>
<p>(Answer) ス丹ナ氏生殖素 (Sudanna Shi Shengzhisu) is the most effective for treating weakness-related ailments such as tinnitus and back pain. 生殖素 is also the first choice for nourishing the body in winter.</p>
<p>Stomach Aches</p>
<p>Wang Xingbao asks: Recently, I often feel uncomfortable in my stomach, with hidden pain. I feel disgusted whenever I eat. What medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>(Answer) You can take 胃痛靈 (Weitong Ling) internally to treat it. Your stomach ailment will soon be eliminated, and your appetite will be stimulated.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission and Weak Brain</p>
<p>Shen Zemin asks: I have suffered from nocturnal emission for many years. Sometimes I have dreams, and sometimes I don't. After the emission, I feel dizzy and have a headache. Please advise on the treatment method.</p>
<p>(Answer) Because you suffer from frequent nocturnal emission, your brain marrow is weak. The treatment method is to take two ヒミ脱氏固精片 (Himituo Shi Gujing Pian) every night before going to bed, and take two ス丹ナ氏生殖素 (Sudanna Shi Shengzhisu) three times a day.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Abdominal Pain</p>
<p>Xue Shixiong asks: My wife has had leukorrhea for years and it has not healed. Internal medicine has not been effective. Recently, she has pain in her lower abdomen. What is the cause? Please provide the treatment method and medicine name.</p>
<p>(Answer) External medicine is the most direct and effective for leukorrhea. You can use 療帶靈 (Liaodailing). Place one or two tablets in the vagina every other day. Leukorrhea can easily cause uterine diseases. Pain in the lower abdomen may be due to a disease in this area. You can directly purchase 女用生殖素 (Nuyong Shengzhisu) from Anlisi Foreign Company to take internally. The combination of internal and external treatment is faster.</p>

<p>Treatment for Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Patient: Lu Yaode, 34 years old, from Sian, military. (Chief Complaint) — Thin, weak, and sickly. Brain pain and forgetfulness. (Medical History) — During the Northern Expedition, he followed the army from place to place. His military life was quite arduous. Mr. Lu held an important position and did much planning for the military. He was mentally and physically exhausted. He repeatedly took various tonics, some of which were too dry and hot, and some of which were too stimulating, but none had much effect. Later, he was introduced by his comrade, Shu Hongfu, to come to my clinic in Shanghai for treatment. (Current Symptoms) Neurasthenia, dizziness, blurred vision, back pain, and fatigue (Treatment) — Because Mr. Lu could not stay in Shanghai for long, I told him to purchase ス丹ナ氏生殖素 (Sudanna Shi Shengzhisu). He felt great after taking it. Later, I received a letter from him saying that after taking half a dozen, he was greatly improved and had become a healthy soldier.</p>
<p>The Pain of Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient: Fu Ruihua, 27 years old, from Zhenhai, sailor. (Chief Complaint) — Nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, insomnia, and headache. (Medical History) — He first masturbated at the age of fourteen, and it became more severe at the age of seventeen. He felt dizzy and had back pain, so he forced himself to quit. That autumn, he suddenly developed nocturnal emission, sometimes once every few days, and sometimes several times a night. He gradually became unsustainable. He repeatedly took various tonics and practiced Baduanjin, but it seemed to be effective and ineffective at the same time. The nocturnal emission occurred about several times a month. He married the following year, but suffered from premature ejaculation, which was not satisfactory. He began to realize that he was terribly weak. This spring, after the ship arrived in Shanghai, he came to my clinic for treatment. (Current Symptoms) — Relaxation of the seminal vesicles and vas deferens, sexual neurasthenia (Treatment) — Because Mr. Fu had to leave Shanghai with the ship that night, in addition to using scientific surgical radio wave therapy, I also prescribed two kinds of medicine. He took two ヒミ脱氏固精片 (Himituo Shi Gujing Pian) every night before going to bed and ス丹ナ氏生殖素 (Sudanna Shi Shengzhisu) three times a day. About two months later, Mr. Fu sent a letter from overseas to thank me, saying that all his ailments had been cured and his body was stronger than before.</p>

<p>1. Insomnia and Forgetfulness Cured at the Same Time</p>
<p>Patient: Tang Jiahong, 29 years old, from Yuanjiahui, lumber dealer. He had a weak constitution. Due to overwork, his nerves were abnormally weak. The most painful symptom was insomnia. He could not sleep at night and had wild thoughts all night long, which greatly drained his energy. During the day, he forgot things as soon as he put them down. He could not remember anything no matter how hard he tried. He had no way to get rid of it and eagerly sought treatment. He tried many kinds of tonics, but they were still in vain. This spring, he came to my clinic for treatment. I found that Tang Jun's brain nerves were weak and could not get good nourishment. I immediately prescribed ス丹ナ氏 "生殖素一" (Sudanna Shi "Shengzhisu Yi"). Before he finished three boxes, he felt his brain marrow was flourishing, he was able to sleep peacefully at night, and his memory was restored. He continued to take two boxes, and all his symptoms disappeared. His physique also became extraordinarily strong. He was like a different person.</p>
<p>2. Treatment of Nocturnal Emission and Kidney Deficiency</p>
<p>Patient: Xiong Zhaoquan, 31 years old, from Shuanglin, educator. He masturbated when he was young and did not know how to cherish himself. He wasted his essence greatly. When he grew up and realized this, he painfully stopped himself. However, he already had kidney deficiency and back pain. At night, in a daze, his essence was involuntarily emitted. He felt dizzy and had tinnitus. He bought a kidney tonic pill, but it was a stimulant. The condition became more severe. Later, he was introduced by his close friend, Lao Meishen, to come to my clinic for treatment. I prescribed ヒミ脱氏固精片 (Himituo Shi Gujing Pian) to treat his nocturnal emission and ス丹ナ氏生殖素 (Sudanna Shi Shengzhisu) to treat his kidney deficiency. After taking three boxes each, his essence was consolidated, his kidneys were sufficient, and all his ailments were gone. Moreover, he was full of energy. Even when lecturing for a long time, he did not feel tired at all.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Using a Positive Grid, Negative Plate Triode as a Detector Tube <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Chong Ling</p>
<p>Usually, with a triode vacuum tube, whether used for oscillation, amplification, or detection, the plate voltage used must be positive, and the grid voltage must be negative. Everyone knows this is a triode with a negative grid and positive plate. The input circuit is the grid circuit, and the output circuit is the plate circuit, with the grid electrode presiding over the control function. To reverse this, using the plate electrode as the control electrode, inputting high-frequency voltage to the plate electrode, and outputting from the grid electrode, has not been seen in practical applications.</p>
<p>The Positive Grid Tube has the same basic structure as an ordinary triode. The difference lies in the exchange of roles between the plate and grid. The plate takes on all the work of the grid in an ordinary triode, and the grid takes on all the work of the plate in an ordinary triode. Therefore, a positive grid, negative plate triode can also be called an Inverted Vacuum Tube. Its main points are three: (1) The grid has a positive voltage, so it can be renamed the positive grid. Because it is closer to the filament, the grid current is quite large; (2) The plate is connected to a negative voltage, so the plate current is small or non-existent. Because it has the main control function, it is renamed the control electrode (Brakeelectrode, to indicate the difference; (3) Since the plate and grid have exchanged functions, the input is handled by the plate circuit, and the output is handled by the grid circuit.</p>
<p>The uses of positive grid, negative plate triodes include the invention of the Barkhausen Oscillator in oscillation, to generate ultra-short waves from ten centimeters to several meters; in amplification, it can be used as a device to reduce voltage, because the input control electrode is farther from the filament than the output positive grid, its function is exactly the opposite of an ordinary triode, actually reducing rather than amplifying; for detection, it can not only be used to receive ultra-short waves, but if handled properly, it can also receive ordinary broadcast bands, and its sensitivity is not weak.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the wiring of a positive grid, negative plate triode. Electrons generated by the filament F are attracted by the positive grid G. Some flow into the grid circuit, and some pass through the grid gap to the vicinity of the control electrode B. If the voltage of the control electrode is positive at this time, this part of the electrons will be absorbed by the control electrode; if the voltage of the control electrode is negative at this time, then this part of the electrons will be rejected by the control electrode and fold back to the grid. If the grid positive voltage is raised to saturation, the total current emitted by the filament, is, has reached saturation and does not change. Then the sum of the plate current, ib, and the grid current, ig, must remain unchanged, because the total current emitted by the filament is the sum of the plate current and the grid current. Therefore,</p>
<p>ib + ig = is = constant</p>
<p>If shown in a diagram, the ig-eb characteristic curve must be a reflection of the ib-eb characteristic curve, as shown in Figure 2, as shown in Figure 2; in other words, the increase in plate current must be equal to the decrease in grid current. If the grid current increases, the plate current must decrease accordingly. If the principle of plate detection of an ordinary triode is applied here, the negative voltage Eb of the control electrode can be matched to the appropriate operating point, then the high-frequency voltage eq input to the control electrode, through rectification, causes the plate current ib to increase according to the input eb waveform, and the grid current ig also decreases along with the plate current waveform, so the detection function is transferred to the output grid circuit.</p>
<p>(1) Ultra-short Wave Detection Applying the above principle, a detection circuit can be obtained as shown in Figure 3 to receive ultra-short waves. The ultra-short wave high-frequency voltage is induced by the antenna to the matching tuning circuit E to reach the control electrode B, and the negative voltage Eb is configured to obtain the corresponding operating point on the control curve ib-eb. Thus, by rectification, the amplitude-modulated signal is delivered to the grid circuit. The change in grid current is made into a voltage change through the action of the load resistor Eg for output. In order to avoid excessive DC voltage drop of Zg consumed in Zg, eb is not a circumferential resistor, but a total impedance (Impedance). Since the current-voltage drop of the total impedance is very small, the Eg used only needs to exceed the saturation value to reduce the grid voltage reduced by the amplitude-modulated current is sufficient.</p>
<p>(2) Broadcast Band Detection Figure 3 can only be applied when the total impedance of the matching tuning circuit E is very small; if the total impedance of E is very large, because ib flows through the total impedance of E, this tube is bound to be insensitive to eb. The E circuit receiving ultra-short waves has a very small total impedance, so it can be as sensitive as an ordinary triode. However, for the wavelength of the broadcast band, the total impedance of the E circuit is sufficient to make Figure 3 inapplicable. To detect the broadcast band, Figure 3 can be improved as shown in Figure 4, and the operating point of ib-eb is configured at P, while the operating point of ig-eb should be q. c is a 100 M.M.F. capacitor connected between the plate and grid to allow a part of the plate current ib to pass through c, to reduce the load of the E circuit. In addition, a high-frequency choke D is inserted in the grid circuit to block the path of high-frequency current flow, while C's impedance to low frequencies is sufficient to prevent the rectification of the grid circuit from flowing into the plate circuit, so the rectification only flows through the grid load Zg. According to the results obtained from the test, the sensitivity of such a device is increased by 45 times compared to Figure 3, and it is not weaker than the detection of an ordinary triode.</p>

<p>— Pao</p>
<p>The vacuum tube to be introduced here is specially used for generating ultra-short wave communications, and its external shape is very special.</p>
<p>This vacuum tube is manufactured by the German Telefunken Co., called the 149Y. It is specially for ultra-short wave oscillation, and the highest oscillation frequency can reach 600 MHz! The specified plate voltage is 400 volts, and the output is about 30 watts. During manufacturing, in order to minimize the internal capacity, this special shape was created.</p>

<p>This machine uses a latest composite vacuum tube—12A7. In addition to the rectifier part undertaking the rectification work, the other amplification part is used in a reflex circuit, so there is one stage of high-frequency amplification, one stage of crystal detection, and one stage of low-frequency amplification. Ideally, although it is not as good as a three-tube machine, it has the performance of a two-tube machine. I listened to it in Suzhou with a speaker, and the results were very good. I would like to introduce it to you for testing.</p>
<p>R1 in the circuit is used as a substitute for the high-frequency choke, for economic reasons, but there are no problems. A 110-volt 30-watt light bulb can also be used. It can be said that this light is like a pilot light, because other resistors also consume power.</p>

<p>— Cao Runsheng</p>
<p>The superheterodyne radio is the best circuit in radios because it has superb selectivity and sensitivity. Its special features are especially evident in Shanghai, where there are many radio stations. The principle of superheterodyne is simple: the incoming radio signal passes through a detector to become a low-frequency current, while the high-frequency current emitted by the local oscillator in the radio mixes with it to become an intermediate frequency between high and low frequencies. Then this intermediate frequency is input to another detector (i.e. the second detector) through an intermediate frequency transformer to become a low-frequency current audible to the human ear. The more difficult thing to manufacture in a superheterodyne radio is the intermediate frequency transformer. This device must be able to allow one type of frequency current to pass through, and other frequencies must absolutely not pass through. At the same time, the mixed frequency of the incoming radio signal and the local oscillator is always the same as the intermediate frequency transformer, otherwise it will fail. The reason why a superheterodyne radio has superb selectivity is also</p>
<p>Very few homemade radios use superheterodyne circuits. Most manufacturers think that superheterodyne is extremely difficult to manufacture and dare not try. However, many people are only interested in entertainment, so they disdain to learn more advanced circuits. In fact, superheterodyne circuits are not difficult to make. If it is difficult, then it is the responsibility that we amateur researchers should bear! Here, the author will introduce to you the simplest superheterodyne radio, which has several characteristics: (To be continued)</p>

<p>The National Games are coming to an end. Yesterday was the ninth day. Three more men's and women's titles were decided. Shanghai consecutively won the baseball, men's volleyball, and women's basketball titles. The men's doubles tennis championship also went to Shanghai. The remaining titles, except for swimming, will all be decided today. It is now impossible for Shanghai to win the overall men's and women's titles. Yesterday, new national records were discovered in both men's and women's swimming. The semi-final football match between Hong Kong, Malaya, Guangdong, and Shanghai was particularly sensational, attracting nearly 100,000 spectators. Thousands more were unable to enter, setting a new record for the scale of sports competitions in Shanghai. Today, Hong Kong and Guangdong will compete for the championship. Since it is a Saturday, it will undoubtedly be even more sensational.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Exciting Women's Swimming Performance: Yang Xiuqiong and Liu Guizhen Break Far Eastern Games Records; 100-meter Preliminaries Changed to Finals; Yang Xiuqiong Narrowly Takes the Lead; Third Place Chen Huanqiong Also Breaks National Record <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Of all the swimming events yesterday, the most tense was the women's 100-meter final. Eight people, including Yang Xiuqiong, participated. The original preliminaries were briskly changed to finals because there were not many participants. The number of swimming spectators yesterday was no less than the day before. Some even came from Nanjing and Hangzhou. As soon as the announcement was made for the women's 100-meter final call, all heads turned, and the crowd was roaring. Even though all latecomers had purchased tickets, many were still unable to enter because it was announced that the stadium was full.</p>
<p>When the Gun Sounds, a Group of Fish Compete</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong was in the front line, with Liu Guizhen to her left. Liu had defeated Xiuqiong in the 50-meter race, and had the ambition to defeat Yang again in the 100-meter race. Yang, on the other hand, prayed to avenge her previous shame in the 100-meter race. As soon as the gun fired, fish leaped into the water. The leader was Chen Huanqiong. Chen's body was short and her speed was excellent. She led the way all the way. At the 50-meter mark, Chen Huanqiong was three meters ahead of Yang Xiuqiong, while Liu Guizhen and Yang Xiuqiong were neck and neck.</p>
<p>Guizhen and Xiuqiong Compete Fiercely</p>
<p>At the 70-meter mark, Chen Huanqiong was still in the lead. Unfortunately, Chen Huanqiong was young and her strength was insufficient, causing her to be chased by Liu Guizhen and Yang Xiuqiong in the last 30 meters. At this moment, the competition between Xiuqiong and Guizhen was the most intense, and the applause from the whole stadium was endless. Guizhen once surpassed Yang, but in the last nine meters, Xiuqiong won with her speed.</p>
<p>The Last Five Meters Determine the Outcome</p>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong's participation in yesterday's 100-meter freestyle final was a dangerous birth, but she finally won the victory in the last five meters, which can be said to be a stroke of luck. Because the competition in this event was so fierce, the top three all broke the national record, and the top two broke the Far Eastern Games record. The results are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Yang Xiuqiong (HK) 1 minute 23 seconds (broke Far Eastern Games and national records)</p>
<p>(2) Liu Guizhen (Guangdong) 1 minute 27.1 seconds (broke Far Eastern Games and national records)</p>
<p>(3) Chen Huanqiong (Guangdong) 1 minute 29 seconds (broke national record)</p>
<p>(4) Deng Haizhen (Guangxi)</p>
<p>(5) Chen Yushan (HK)</p>

<p>Yang Weimo is an overseas Chinese born in Singapore. He is only 16 years old. He has repeatedly set national records in middle-distance swimming in Nanyang. Last year, Dr. Wang Zhengting visited Nanyang and appreciated Yang's skills, greatly encouraging him, and told him that the National Games would be held in Shanghai, and asked him to return to China to participate. This time, Yang's skills were extraordinary. In the preliminary round, he broke the national record, and in the final, he broke the national record again.</p>
<p>Taking the Lead from the Start, Posture Light and Agile</p>
<p>Yang Weimo took the lead at the starting line. His swimming method was very agile. He did not seem to use much force, but his speed was extremely fast. At the first turn at 50 meters, Mai Weiming followed about one meter behind Yang. At 150 meters, Chen Zhennan surpassed Mai Weiming and advanced to second place.</p>
<p>Weimo and Zhennan Refuse to Yield to Each Other</p>
<p>Before long, Chen Zhennan courageously caught up with Yang Weimo, but Yang also refused to give in, and paddled forward hard. At 250 meters, they were almost completely side by side, indistinguishable. The remaining contestants were far behind.</p>
<p>Finishing in One Breath, Taking the Lead</p>
<p>After 350 meters, the competition between Yang and Chen was still indistinguishable, and the applause from the whole stadium was deafening. However, Yang finished in one breath in the last ten meters. Chen Zhennan was ultimately no match for Yang's city strength and finished second. However, the results of the two were very close, and both broke the national record.</p>
<p>(1) Yang Weimo (Malaya) 5 minutes 33.2 seconds (broke national record)</p>

<h3 id="e211">Far Eastern Games Record Shattered: Women's 200-meter Breaststroke Preliminaries; All Three Groups Break Record; Today's Final; Yang Xiuqiong Actually Withdraws <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yang Xiuqiong actually withdrew from the women's 200-meter breaststroke preliminaries. Yesterday's 300-meter breaststroke preliminaries were held after yesterday's women's 100-meter final. Yang was exhausted from her desperate struggle in the 100-meter race, narrowly escaping to retain her championship title and washing away her shame from the 50-meter race the day before, so she withdrew from the 200-meter breaststroke. In the women's 200-meter breaststroke preliminaries, the first place in the first group, Chen Yuqiong from Guangdong, broke the national record and the Far Eastern Games record with a time of 3 minutes 129.7 seconds, swimming incredibly fast, more than ten meters ahead of the second and third places. The second place, Qu Enzhao, had a time of 3 minutes 52.9 seconds. The first place in the second group, Lin Duli, had a time of 3 minutes 47.5 seconds, also breaking the Far Eastern Games record, but not the national record.</p>
<p>National Record Higher than Far Eastern</p>
<p>The so-called "Far Eastern Record" for women's swimming is the performance of women's swimming at the 10th Far Eastern Games. Only Chinese and Filipino teams participated in that performance, with just over ten people. The championship of each performance was monopolized by Chinese, and if Japanese had attended, China would have been hopeless. Furthermore, it was not possible for Chinese to keep hold of the Far Eastern Women's Swimming Records, so, the current Far Eastern Records are extremely primitive, and even lower than National Records, for example, the Far Eastern Record of women's 200-metre breaststroke is 3 minutes 58 seconds (held by Chen Huanqiong), while the National Record is 3 minutes 41.1 seconds which is much higher than the Far Eastern Games Record.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiuzhen's One-Woman Show</p>
<p>In the third group, because many people were temporarily absent and Yang Xiuqiong did not swim, only Zhou Xiuzhen from Shanghai sang a one-woman show, and the result was that she swam the entire course with a time of 4 minutes 19 seconds.</p>
<p>First Group (Taking Four People)</p>
<p>(1) Chen Yuqiong (Guangdong), 3 minutes 2 minutes 39.7 seconds (broke national · Far Eastern) (2) Qu Enzhao (HK), 3 minutes 52.9 seconds (broke Far Eastern · Did not break National), (4) He Wenjin (Beijing), (4) Gao Heyi Guangdong),</p>
<p>Second Group (Taking Three People)</p>
<p>(1) Lin Duli (Guangdong), 3 minutes 47.5 seconds (broke Far Eastern · Did not break National), (2) Xu Zhenwan (Guangxi), (3) Yang Xiuzhen (HK),</p>
<p>Third Group (Only One Person)</p>

<p>Hong Kong and Guangdong Football Teams are Well-Matched</p>
<p>The ideal Guangdong vs. Hong Kong football final has now become a reality. At the beginning of this championship, Guangdong was thought to have the highest chance of winning. However, after Wong Ki-leung, Fung King-cheung, Li Tiansheng, and Yip Bak-wah were absent due to various reasons, attention shifted to Hong Kong. Nevertheless, Guangdong's strength should not be underestimated. Hong Kong excels in offense, while Guangdong is skilled in defense. Each has its own expertise. They are well-matched, and it is difficult to predict who will emerge victorious. The match will begin at 3 PM. The third and fourth place final between Shanghai and Malaya will start at 1 PM. It is expected that today's audience will be comparable to that of yesterday.</p>
<p>Men's Basketball – Nanjing Shows Promise</p>
<p>Among the teams participating in this men's basketball competition, the Nanjing team is generally considered the strongest. According to general observation, the Philippine team is also full of talented players with profound skills. Unfortunately, the Philippines encountered Nanjing in the second round and was eliminated, which is a pity. It was unexpected that Beiping lost to Hebei yesterday. Shanghai's loss to Nanjing is not surprising. In today's final between Nanjing and Hebei, Nanjing can rest assured.</p>
<p>Men's and Women's Tennis Singles Finals</p>
<p>The men's and women's tennis doubles championships were already decided yesterday. Today's events are all singles finals. The men who qualified for the final are Xu Chengji and Qiu Feihai. Qiu performed excellently in yesterday's doubles final, appearing to have recovered his past prowess. Therefore, in today's singles match, he may pose a significant threat to Xu Chengji. Another group is the consolation match between Lin Baohua and Qian Yaobin. Lin's performances have been brilliant in recent days. Although Qian is too impulsive, he is a promising newcomer and a good player. Competing against Lin, with his bold and decisive style, will be quite a sight. In the women's group, Wang Chunfu from Shanxi and Wei Maigu from Shanghai will compete for the top spot. Wang's topspin is powerful, while Wei from Shanghai is commendable for her steadiness. One is hard and one is soft, one is yielding and one is firm. It will be a fierce battle to determine who will prevail. The competition will be between Huang Shanong and Chen Qing. Both are representatives of the capital. Their skills are comparable. Although Chen lost to Huang in the preliminary round, this time the sisters meet again, and she will surely seek revenge, so there will be some competition as well.</p>
<p>Women's Volleyball – Shanghai Holds High Hopes</p>
<p>According to the results of the women's volleyball matches in recent days, Guangdong and Shanghai have risen to the top. The final will be held at 3 PM today. The Shanghai team is the champion of the previous championship, while the Guangdong team is a heroine from South China. These rivals will meet on a narrow path, and the performance will surely be spectacular. However, based on strength, this competition will likely be a close match. Shanghai's coordination is good, but a major weakness is the lack of power in its spikes. Hong Kong's defense is not well-rounded, which is also a shortcoming. Who will emerge victorious in today's final will depend on the efforts of each team. However, with the dispersal of veterans from the Shanghai team, there will inevitably be a sense of apprehension. The third and fourth place final will be held at 1 PM, and Hunan is more likely to win. The second and third place final will depend on the strength of the team that lost the championship, which will only be known after it is revealed.</p>

<p>The Games will close tomorrow. A disaster relief competition is scheduled for the 21st, the day after tomorrow. Men's and women's swimming competitions will be held from 2 PM that afternoon. Tickets are priced at one yuan and two yuan. Complimentary tickets are invalid. In addition, a football match will be held on the 26th (Saturday). If the strong football teams do not go to Nanjing for the disaster relief competition, it will be held earlier on the 23rd; otherwise, it will still be on the 26th. In this way, the audience can both enjoy sports skills and help disaster victims, which is truly a win-win situation.</p>

<p>All athletes and staff of the various units of this National Games heard that Chairman Chiang had returned to Nanjing a few days ago for official business. They were eager for Chiang to come to Shanghai to visit the National Games, hoping to witness his demeanor and listen to his instructions. Therefore, they sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang yesterday inviting him to come to Shanghai. However, Chiang replied that he had just arrived in Nanjing and had many important public affairs to deal with, and the National Games was about to close, so he was unable to come to Shanghai for a visit. He sent a telegram to Vice President Wu expressing his apologies and encouraging all the athletes.</p>

<p>Yesterday's football semifinals featured the four strongest teams – Shanghai, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Malaya – all competing in battle. The situation was extremely balanced, and the battles were earth-shattering. 100,000 fans gathered at the stadium, considering it a rare opportunity to watch the tactics of four teams at the same time. The surrounding stands were densely packed. Before 1 PM, there was no empty seat. Those who arrived later could only sigh outside the stadium. All the car rental companies were completely booked. Thousands of school groups who rushed from Nanjing and Hangzhou sat on the ground beside the track. It was the most magnificent scene since the opening of the Games. In the first match, Hong Kong fought Malaya. The battle was fierce, with men and horses clashing. The situation was very tense, and there were many more brilliant performances. In the end, the Hong Kong army was fortunate to win with a score of 3-2. In the second match, Guangdong defeated Shanghai with a score of 3-1. The Hong Kong and Guangdong armies obtained the right to compete in the final and will meet at 3 PM today to determine the champion. The call for the football championship is highest for Hong Kong, but the Guangdong army is brave and willing to fight. The future of the war is half-dependent on the fate of the ball. In addition, Shanghai and Malaya, the teams that failed in the semi-finals, will also fight at 1 PM today to determine the third and fourth places. The loser will be fourth, and the winner will fight against the loser of the final at 9 AM on the 20th. The winner will be the runner-up, and the loser will be the third place. In this type of chain-style competition, each team has the opportunity to meet each other, which is very interesting.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Malaya Fought Hard but Lost to Hong Kong – Dominated with 2-1 Lead in the First Half – Intense Firepower – Li Huitang Led the Counterattack and Hong Kong Won the Final Victory <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>At 1 PM yesterday, the Hong Kong vs. Malaya football match kicked off amidst the sound of the silver whistle. The atmosphere of the entire stadium suddenly became tense. Malaya attacked first, and the Hong Kong army actively responded. They exchanged blows. After ten minutes, Hong Kong won a corner kick, which was taken by Cao Guicheng. The ball landed in the best position in front of the goal. After a fierce struggle between the two sides, Huang Meishun got the ball and took a long shot. The ball entered the net from the left corner. Amid cheers, the first goal was scored.</p>
<p>Malaya Attacked and Tied the Score</p>
<p>Having suffered this blow, Malaya tried its best to counterattack. After four minutes, it got a free kick opportunity. The right inside forward dribbled the ball and passed it to the right winger, Yin Jinzhen, who broke through the defense line and used his light feet to shoot the ball into the net. Bao Gang's eyes were fixed and his mouth was agape. The whole army was shocked and lost its color, and the score was tied at 1-1. Afterwards, the ball mostly revolved in front of the Malay team. Because of its solid defense and responsible goalkeeper, there was no loss of ground. The ball king Li Huitang was also under severe surveillance and could not find a way.</p>
<p>The Steel Gate Saved a Sneak Attack</p>
<p>At 31 minutes, the five Malayan forwards penetrated deep into the Hong Kong team's hinterland, charging left and right, and were extremely active. Center forward Xie Qingfu passed the ball to left forward Du Yachi, who dribbled past the difficult hurdle of Yu Qingyuan. The Hong Kong army was unable to save in time. Seeing the situation was extremely critical, Bao Gang left his old nest lightly and rushed forward to grab the ball. Unexpectedly, he did not grab the ball, and Malaya's left inside forward Guan Xinde got the ball and stole the Yinping Pass. The flying general descended from the sky, and there was an empty city. There was no one to resist. He kicked the ball, and it stepped slowly into the goal. Bao Jiaqian was unable to turn around in time and stomped his feet repeatedly. The score was 2-1, and Malaya took the lead. Afterwards, there was a long melee. The Hong Kong team's military strength gradually became scattered. Because the inner defense was weak, it was often attacked. The Malay army's left and right forwards fought swiftly, but their shots lacked power. The first half ended with a score of 2-1. The general audience thought that the Hong Kong army was discouraged, and some suspected that the ball king would not be able to do anything in the end.</p>
<p>Li and Chen Passed the Ball and the Ball King Scored</p>
<p>After the break, the ball situation of the Malaya team became even stronger. Although the Hong Kong army attacked several times, creating opportunities to attack, either the ball went out of bounds or over the net, and there was no achievement in the end. The military spirit was dispersed. Therefore, the Malaya team became more brave. In the end, the Xin goalkeeper relied on his experience and means to defend effectively, punching and kicking, and saved many dangerous balls. The offensive slackened slightly. At the 15th minute, the ball king got the ball and passed it diagonally to Zheng Jiliang. The Malay army rushed to Zheng to snatch the ball, but Zheng passed it to the ball king again. Li Huitang was surrounded by three enemies, but the ball was like a magnet, and it never left his feet. He dribbled to a place more than ten feet in front of the goal. Just as he raised his feet, the ball had already entered the net, clearly and beautifully. Some of the audience shouted "Long live Li Huitang." The Hong Kong army was greatly boosted, as if it had taken a shot of morphine. The turning point of victory was completely in this ball.</p>
<p>Malaya Fought Hard but Lost by One Goal</p>
<p>After being lifted by the ball king, the Hong Kong army's morale suddenly increased. The war record had become 2-1. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat, reaching the point of melee. The performance was full of excitement and extremely tense. The audience held their breath and watched attentively. When there was danger, there were sounds of "Ah yo," which was indeed a vivid war. Both sides were careful. There was no record for five minutes. At the 20th minute, the Hong Kong right inside forward passed the ball to Li, who passed it to Liang again. Liang sprinted and broke through the defense line. The ball was like a bullet and was shot into the net from the left corner, creating a record of 3-1. Hong Kong won. Therefore, the Hong Kong army's momentum became even stronger, and Malaya was temporarily trapped in a hard battle. The five Hong Kong forwards frequently attacked the goal, but none of them hit the target. At 35 minutes, the Malay army won a corner kick. The landing point was excellent. The center forward caught up and kicked the ball over the net, which was a pity. Before long, the three Malay forwards charged straight to the goal. The ball landed and advanced quickly like an arrow. The steel gate saved the ball by lying down and catching it, which was a wonderful posture. Guan Xinde was also injured and fell to the ground. He was carried out of the stadium for treatment by the Boy Scouts. Afterwards, the Malay army surrounded and attacked the Hong Kong goal five times, but all of them were defused by the Bao steel gate. When it was about to end, the Malay army won another opportunity for a corner kick, again and again. Just as he was about to raise his foot, the competition time had arrived. The Hong Kong army won the right to the final with a score of 3-2.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Wiped Away the Previous Humiliation – Guangdong Defeated Shanghai – Fierce 1-on-1 Battle in the First Half Ended in a Draw – Guangdong Scored Two Goals After Changing Its Lineup <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>As soon as the Hong Kong-Malaya battle ended, the Shanghai and Guangdong warriors were dressed and ready to enter the stadium. The music rose and fell, and the whole stadium cheered. At exactly 3 PM, the match began. The Shanghai army launched a full-scale attack. Wan Xianghua penetrated deep along the side and passed to Chen Zhenxiang. The attack went out of bounds. In the first fifteen minutes, the Shanghai army's offensive did not wane. Wan Xianghua had the most opportunities to attack the goal, but he failed to score due to haste. After a long melee, neither side had a brilliant performance.</p>
<p>Li Ning Lost His Footing and Guangdong Scored First</p>
<p>At the 26th minute, Guangdong's right inside forward Tan Jiangbai got the ball and bravely moved forward. Li Ning intercepted and engaged in battle. Unexpectedly, Li Ning lost his footing and fell to the ground due to a slight carelessness. Tan took the opportunity to pass the ball to Yang Shuiyi, who passed it to Huang Yongkang. Huang attacked the goal fiercely. Zhang Rongcai punched the ball out, but it was obtained by Yang Shuiyi again. He turned around and kicked the ball, which touched the goal post and bounced into the net. It was the will of heaven, not the fault of the war. The score was 1-0, and the Guangdong army scored first.</p>
<p>Yi Chen Attacked the Goal and Tied the Score</p>
<p>Although Shanghai lost a city, it did not care at all. Dai Linjing led the three armies straight to the enemy camp. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun each had several excellent scoring opportunities, but they missed the goal by inches. The Guangdong side guarded even more strictly. Xu Yahui was both civil and martial, providing support from the front and rear, and his contribution was great. There were only five minutes left before the end of the first half, and the audience was worried about the Shanghai team. Fortunately, good fortune befell it. Sun Jinshun charged straight into the enemy camp alone, and Li Yichen chased forward. He Zuoxian greeted and pounced on Sun, who passed the ball to Li. Mai Shaohan shouted loudly, raised his foot to block the ball, but was knocked to the ground and injured due to excessive momentum. Li had already passed the checkpoint and gently stretched out his foot to attack the ball, hitting the target and tying the score at 1-1.</p>
<p>Hei Tan Was Ferocious and Rongcai Was Injured</p>
<p>Guangdong replaced Tan Jiangbai with a defensive player due to Mai's injury and continued to fight. The cannons blazed, and the fighters of Bianfang team were furious. The battle became even more fierce. On one occasion, the Guangdong army kicked a corner kick. Xiao Hei Tan Chen Zhenhe fought with the goalkeeper. Although the ball was saved, Zhang Rongcai fell to the ground and was injured. After a short break, he jumped up and responded to the battle. The whole stadium praised his bravery. A minute later, the silver whistle sounded, and the first half ended. Everyone was happy and announced a break. Both sides, with the enemy in front of them and the championship at stake, gathered the warriors and gave them face-to-face instructions.</p>
<p>Changed Lineup and the Guangdong Army Succeeded</p>
<p>In the second half, the Guangdong side changed its strategy, mobilized its military strength, and the momentum was extremely strong. At the beginning of the kickoff, the five Guangdong forwards came like a mountain and a sea, rolling forward. Feng Lianzuo and Li Ning, the old generals, were calm and blocked them from left and right. Dai Lin eventually got the ball and counterattacked, breaking through the defense line and passing it to Li Yichen, who was less than thirteen yards away from the goal. The ball was like a bullet and went straight out of bounds, which was a pity. It was said that this was a sign of Shanghai's defeat, and it was indeed the case. In the sixth minute, Xiao Hei Tan Chen Zhenhe dribbled the ball deep, passing several lines of defense and scoring a goal, making the score 2-1. Guangdong had already won. Two minutes later, the Guangdong army arrived again. There was a melee in front of the Shanghai goal, and the situation was dangerous. The three forwards rushed into the net at the same time with the ball and fell into another city, making the score 3-1. The Shanghai team was discouraged and showed a tendency to fall.</p>
<p>Defense Alone Was Futile</p>
<p>At the same time, the Guangdong goalkeeper, Xiao Dianlian, had the same level of skill as Bao Jiaping, and even the feet of Sun Jinshun and Li Yichen could not do anything about it. In half an hour, neither side scored. The Guangdong army, with victory in hand, used the method of clearing the field, defending on all sides. The Shanghai side became more and more anxious, making mistakes everywhere. The left and right wings passed the ball extremely slowly. Although Sun and Li's feet were accurate, they had no chance to kick, which was even more heartbreaking. Jia Youliang shot twice from a distance of several feet, but he did not hit the target either. There seemed to be a providence in this. Before long, the war ended, and Shanghai lost to Guangdong with a score of 1-3. Guangdong avenged its defeat in the final against Shanghai in the previous National Games. They will play the final championship match against Hong Kong at 3 PM today, which will be a fierce battle.</p>

<h3 id="e224">A General Review of the Skills of the Four Teams – Hong Kong is the Most Lively, but Its Inner Defense is Inferior – Malaya is Good at Passing, but Lacks Power in Shooting – Shanghai is Slow and Good at Defense – Guangdong is Extremely Fortunate and Overly Impulsive <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>In summary, the battles of the Hong Kong, Malaya, Guangdong, and Shanghai football teams yesterday showed that their strengths were comparable. The Hong Kong five forwards were the most lively and rapid. The left and right wings, Cao Guicheng and Zheng Jiliang, both had the skills of flying legs. The ball king Li Huitang responded to the left and right, dribbled past the defense line, and his arrows never missed the target. This is the way to win. However, the inner defense line seemed a bit weak. Fortunately, there was the Bao steel gate to guard the final checkpoint, so that the entire army had no worries. Otherwise, it would be difficult to obtain the final victory. The Malayan team's passing was magical, and its long and short passes and defense line were also well-matched. However, the five forwards lacked experience in shooting, and they often panicked and scattered at critical moments, or shot without hitting the target, which was a major problem. The Shanghai five forwards were slow, especially the two wings. Sun Jinshun and Li Taichen were both fat and could not run flexibly, which was a disadvantage. The defense line was the best in Shanghai. The goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai's qualifications were shallow, but in yesterday's battle, he can be said to have fulfilled his duty. The Guangdong team was brave and good at fighting. The five forwards' desperate efforts were admirable. The feet of Tan Jiangbai and Xu Yahui can be called unparalleled at the time. However, sometimes the whole army was overly impulsive and lacked cultivation. When winning, they were good at advancing and retreating, but when they failed, it was difficult to control them. Before reaching the stage of perfection, they should add some cultivation.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Men's Baseball Shanghai Wins Baseball Championship, Liang Fuchu and Gan Zhen's Great Contributions, Seven to Two Victory Over Previous Champion Guangdong <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>In this year's baseball championship, Shanghai seized it from Guangdong, Guangdong was second, Beiping was third, Hebei was fourth, and the baseball battle of heroes vying for supremacy has now come to an end.</p>
<p>Great Hero Glorifies Shanghai's History</p>
<p>Baseball games at the National Games started in the second session, with North China winning the first championship, East China in the third, Hong Kong in the fourth, Guangdong in the fifth, and Shanghai in this session. Shanghai played a total of three games, first defeating Hunan, then Hebei, and finally defeating Guangdong to win the championship. Among the three games, the most important and exciting was the game against Guangdong. At that time, both sides were evenly matched, and the outcome was still unknown. In the fourth inning, veteran Liang Fuchu, based on his 38 years of rich experience, hit an unexpected sacrifice hit, first opening the scoring for the Shanghai team. In addition, pitcher Gan Zhen's ball was twisting and powerful, and the athletes of South China were all subdued by his ball, and even a small advance was difficult. Therefore, there were few enemy traces within Shanghai's defense, and his contribution to protecting the territory and securing the people was great. This person has glorified the historical record, and at the same time, all the team members have also done their duty, dominating the country, which is a matter of fact.</p>
<p>Former Champion Comes with a Preemptive Strike</p>
<p>The Guangdong team, the former champion, had talented people, excellent base-stealing skills, and hitting techniques. It was a pity that pitcher Yu Bohui could not exert his consistent powerful arm strength and exposed his weaknesses greatly in the seventh inning, opening the door to the enemy, almost unable to leave the field. In the first inning, the Guangdong team took the lead in attacking, worth four balls, walked to first base, and took advantage of the unpreparedness to steal second base again, which was a clear sign of an unfavorable start. But Lin stole to third base again, and Yu Bohui was retired after three hits. Gao Hanen came up to bat and came with a preemptive strike, hitting a single that went past first base. Lin knew that the opportunity could not be missed, and quickly returned, making the first contribution for Guangdong. Zhou Zhaojun was caught at first base, and Guangdong turned from offense to defense, waiting for Shanghai to attack. Shanghai was repeatedly disadvantaged. At the end of the first inning, Guangdong had one point, and Shanghai had zero. In the second and third innings, both sides were under strict surveillance, and they were bound by strategies. Although Shanghai's He Qionghua got a double in the second inning, and Liang ChengSong got a single in the second inning, they were unable to fulfill their ambitions due to their weak forces.</p>
<p>The Heroes Make a Big Scene in the Fourth Inning</p>
<p>In the fourth inning, Guangdong's first attack was unfavorable. When it was Shanghai's turn, hits came one after another. Zeng Ruikang hit and reached base, and Gan Cheng also hit a single, Zeng reached third base, and Gan stayed at first base. Veteran Liang Fuchu had a flash of inspiration and took advantage of the unpreparedness, lightly touching the ball to make a sacrifice hit, and Zeng returned to score, opening the scoring on the scorebook. Gan advanced to second base, and Liang reached first base. He Qionghua hit another single, and Gan and Liang each advanced one base, all bases were full. He Xiancheng came on the field, the pitcher gave in, and each advanced one base, and Gan slowly returned to base. When An Lesheng attacked, Liang also took advantage of the fielding error and ran to fourth base. At that time, Shanghai had scored three consecutive points. Continuing to return were He Xiancheng, An Lesheng, Zhou Jun, and Liang ChengSong, who won a total of seven points, while Guangdong got nothing. In the fifth inning, neither side scored. In the sixth inning, Guangdong's Gao Hanen hit and reached base, stole a base, was injured, and was replaced by Liu Duming. Huang Youxun hit a single, and Liu replaced Gao to return to base. Huang Zhaoxiong also hit a single, but Huang Youxun was caught before returning to base. All the efforts were abandoned. In the following innings, the pitchers of both sides showed their skills, and the attackers changed hands. In the second half of the ninth inning, Shanghai, with the victory in hand, decided to give up. As a result, Shanghai won seven to two. The umpire was Zhang Guoxun, the base umpire was Chen Futian, and the scorer was Li Jun.</p>

<p>The women's tennis doubles final was held yesterday, with Shanxi's Wang sisters playing against Sichuan's Li Yuping and Zhao Yunhua. The situation was very different, forming a one-sided game. The Shanxi team won the championship easily. There was still one competition for the Shanghai Wei sisters against the Malaysian Chinese Lu Suli and Xie Nili's losing match. As a result, the Malaysian Chinese team failed and got the fourth place. The Shanghai and Sichuan teams are scheduled to decide the second and third place at 3 pm today. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Two CDs</p>
<p>It is said that Shanxi has many chickens and ducks. This time, the Wang sisters brought a lot of them. Therefore, although they have been invincible since participating in the competition, they often respect guests with chicken eggs and duck eggs during the war for the purpose of contacting feelings. Those who confronted them, even if they used all their skills, still failed to return the gift. The Sichuan ladies were naturally no exception. In terms of Li Zhao's tennis skills, they are only similar to the Shanghai Wei sisters. The Wei sisters were treated with a pair of duck eggs, one for each person. When they met yesterday, the Sichuan sisters naturally did not favor one over the other, so as to avoid uneven distribution and disputes. So they first respected the Sichuan sister and then gave gifts to the Sichuan sister, all of whom laughed and returned with a full load.</p>
<p>Sheep Fall into the Tiger's Mouth</p>
<p>The Shanghai Wei sisters participated in the hands of the Wang sisters, and they were really unwilling, but there was no chance to meet again, so they had to take revenge from others. They took the offensive from beginning to end against the Malaysian Chinese girls. The Malaysian Chinese girls also belong to the sheep category. The sheep fell into the tiger's mouth, how can they survive? Although it is better to live badly than to die well, the sheep bravely resisted, but they were unable to do what they wanted. At the end of the two sets, the Wei sisters won with 6-1 and 6-3.</p>
<p>Women's Doubles Situation</p>
<h3 id="e227">Women's Volleyball Women's Volleyball Semi-finals Shanghai and Guangdong Win the Right to Finals Guangdong Wins Hunan in a Hard-fought 3-2 Shanghai Wins Beiping Team in Straight Sets <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>There were two semi-final matches in women's volleyball yesterday. Both sides did their best for the championship. The situation was very tight, and the match between Guangdong and Hunan was particularly exciting. As a result, Guangdong won Hunan with three to two, and Shanghai won Beiping with three to zero. The final will be held today. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Wins Hunan</p>
<p>Hunan Army's Great Courage Guangdong Falls into Embarrassment</p>
<p>In the women's volleyball semi-finals, the Guangdong team faced Hunan. One is a veteran style, and the other is a newly trained elite. In theory, the war will not be very tense. However, Guangdong is not sharp enough. Although the veterans are fighting hard, they still have a chance to win, but the war situation has been extremely embarrassing. Today's war against Shanghai, if the situation is still the same, the future is difficult to be optimistic. The game started at one o'clock. The Hunan army's front row, although short, is elite and powerful, and strives to fight with the determination of not being afraid of setbacks. Guangdong did not understand the strength of the opponent, and Yang Xingfen and Bao Yiwei in the back row were even more careless. After half the game, they were almost severely damaged. Xin Yanxiurong supported the mansion at the opportunity, and the first game was able to take the advantage with 21 to 18.</p>
<p>Escape from Death to a Tie</p>
<p>In the second game, the Hunan army came more fiercely. Liu Xingheng was small but bold. The Guangdong army's heavy troops came to commit, and they were blocked. At this time, the whole game only saw the world of the Hunan army. The Guangdong army not only had no way to attack, but also could not close the door to defend itself. In the first half of the game, it was inferior to Hunan with a large difference of 2 to 11. After changing the position, Guangdong got the help of the wall, and started to escape from death. For a time, the wind and rain roared. Hunan was ultimately inexperienced in the war. Under a scare, they repeatedly missed, gained less and lost more, and the battle base changed again. At 19 to 19, the Hunan army killed fiercely and scored another point, creating a tie of one to one.</p>
<p>Fighting with Fists and Feet Guangdong Wins Again</p>
<p>In the third game, the Guangdong army took advantage of the situation and easily wrote. The Hunan army inevitably had a big mess. In the first half of the game, they changed the troops with a difference of 9 to 11. After changing the horse's head, they tried to counterattack again. However, the daughter's family had short-sightedness, and the South Korean athletes were also very stingy. When they came to the feet, they must return two punches. In the midst of the disturbance, the Guangdong army regained a game, and the Hunan old country fellows could not help but be discouraged.</p>
<p>Screaming Shocked the Ball and Rumbled the Ground</p>
<p>In the first three games, Guangdong won two and lost one, occupying the upper hand. If Hunan could turn the tide in this battle, it could still talk about the championship. Therefore, under the change of strategy and the change of lineup, it tried to cheer up. Guangdong also prepared for the enemy. As soon as they came on the field, they twisted the snake and saw no Xuan Chi. When the score was called at 14 to 10, they saw the clue. In an instant, they only heard the sound of the Oriole across the shore, and the ball in the field rumbled the ground, waving their hands and killing, in a flash, Hunan won with 21 to 19, and the total score was two to two.</p>
<p>Arrogantly Guangdong Advances</p>
<p>In the fifth game, Ma Xingyan in the middle row of Guangdong lightly passed the ball to the right corner of the net when facing the ball coming from the area. Lin Dezhen could not bear the itchiness and used this to kill. She vented her hatred and grievances. The ball saving in the back row was not very good, but when the time came, it was still quite beautiful, creating a score of 16 to 18. The Guangdong heroines hoped to add a few points, that is, they had the hope of a championship, but they did not know that under the eagerness to win, the pace was out of order. The Hunan army came with two balls, plain and tasteless, and actually stepped on the wrong pace and lost. The Hunan army then actively fought hand-to-hand, traveled and retreated, regardless of male or female. Guangdong was also inevitable to be startled, so they carefully operated and calmly responded. At each of the 20 points, they finally had the opportunity to re-press, Yang Yuqiong and Yan Xiurong on the left and right, each with a note, completed the whole game. So the Guangdong army laughed and arrogantly, and the Hunan army covered their sleeves and hated their own thin life. The referee announced that Guangdong had won the right to the final with two to two under the sweat of both sides.</p>
<p>Shanghai Wins Beiping</p>
<p>Jumping Not High Victory Is Not Easy</p>
<p>In the second semi-final of women's volleyball, Shanghai faced Beiping alone. Shanghai was the champion team of the last National Games, and its reputation was loud. In the next game, this was against Henan, but the Yu army gave up, which caused the Shanghai volleyball lineup not to reflect in the eyes of the people. When they played yesterday, it seemed that most of them were not the old team, but the backbone Huang Xingfen was still the same. After Beiping opened the ball, they gained three points. The reputation of that year was still not pushed back. Zhang Lizhu was also able to fight and was a beam material. All the way, there was no major flaw, but the blocking and hitting of the two wings, the jump was not high, and the strength was not enough, so the first game only won with a ratio of 21 to 7. Although it was laborious, there was no special performance.</p>
<p>The Voice of the Crowd Is High, but the Pipa Is Played in Reverse</p>
<p>After the two sides rested, they opened fire again, whining and humming, which was not as hard as the men. In fact, winning is to be coquettish, and losing is to cry, which is a common expression of the ladies. In the second game, there was first crying and laughing, but the Beijing Miss's poor performance in the back guard was indeed the most important reason for the failure of this game. In the second half of the game, the cheerleading team outside the venue sang urgently, and Beiping carried the Pipa on its back and played it so and so, which created a game of 21 to 7. Beiping was in a mess.</p>
<p>Breaking Through and Turning to Safety, Three Wins in Three Games</p>
<p>In the third game, Miss Fang Ji from Beiping served the ball, and Yan cha cha, had not expected the daughter's part, it can be seen that the depth of the injustice of losing a game, into the hearts of the people. Under a search, the happy news was announced for the men, and Shang Zhan continued to succeed, and became a double fifteen. When the Shanghai people saw that the situation was not good, they hurriedly greeted the emergency mobilization. When a ball fell into the formation, no one dared to be negligent, and they actually washed away the atmosphere of powder and grease, repeatedly falling into danger, and repeatedly broke through. The final result was that they defeated the former capital's heroines by a straight line of three to 21 to 16. The Shanghai team will face the South Korean athletes today, and the sisters are well advised to reflect on themselves.</p>

The game started at three o'clock yesterday, and as a result, three to zero, the Shanghai team won a great victory, raised the championship, and added a lot of glory. However, during the game, in addition to the ball game, there was a scene where the audience assaulted and insulted the referee. Although the game continued immediately, the life was inevitable to be a flaw in the wall. The permit is as follows:</p>

<p>Soft Harmonious Shanghai Team Wins Again</p>
<p>In the second game, Li Fushen of the Guangdong army opened the ball, but he did not get the point, Shanghai got the ball, but it was not easy to relax, opened the row of resistance, specializing in the bureau, occasionally soft ball blocking the net, then the backhand pressed, the landing point was often near the left of the net post, and as described oblique, the Guangdong team had no reaction, high ball passed the border, then there was Qiu Guang specializing in large knife and axe, The pot also fueled the flames, with a soft and hard harmony, almost making the opposite area bound hands and feet, The back row of the Guangdong team, there is a daily rescue work, did not see the effort, in a moment, it has won again with 11 to 6, In the second half of the game, the Guangdong team also once counterattacked, with Cao Tingzan of the Shanghai team taking care of the front and back, although he was hit by artillery, the Shanghai team's steel armor protected the body, and did not suffer a great disaster, At this time, there was a slight dispute over the problem of the ball falling out of bounds at the bottom line, which was immediately eliminated based on the line officer's determination, As a result, 21 to 11, Shanghai won another game, the audience full of, sighed in this crazy storm, the color sound is endless,</p>
<p>Disputes Occur, Referees Are Insulted</p>
<p>After the opening of the third game, the two sides fought more fiercely, Guangdong held the determination to break the cauldron and sink the boat, so they struggled hard, hoping to fight with their backs to the city to save the crisis, The audience inside and outside the venue also cheered for the Guangdong team, but the fate was not good, and they could not get their wish, The Shanghai team still led with a score of one, Then Shanghai served the ball over the border, and after Ma Yuanbai of the Guangdong team held the ball on the left wing, the forward took the opportunity to press and kill, eye to hand, it was indeed sensitive, The referee whistled to order Shanghai to score because the Guangdong forward's hand was before the ball when blocking the net, As soon as the whistle sounded, it was not planned that four or five members of the cheerleading team in the audience would stand up angrily, with a fierce momentum, When they arrived at the referee's seat, they forcibly pulled down Qian Yile with hard hands and feet, Fortunately, Qianji was surprised to find out, and immediately jumped down from Gaodeng, but he had already suffered some beatings and insults, and tore off the referee's badge, The police scout who maintained order in the scene hurriedly stepped forward to protect and escorted Qian out of the venue, The game was suspended and the order was inevitable.</p>

<p>After the opening, Qiu Guang continued to serve, and scored a few points in a few minutes, becoming 11 to 7, the Shanghai team took the upper hand, After changing places, Mei Dixian of the Guangdong team made two fierce attacks, but the Shanghai team's walls were strict, and although they crossed the Thunder Pool, they mostly returned without success, The Shanghai team took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, and won more points, As a result, 21 to 11, the Shanghai team won again, The total result was three to zero, and the Shanghai team won the Men's Volleyball Championship this year, The two team's formations suddenly occurred as follows,</p>
<p>General Discussions on the Cause of the Dispute</p>
<p>During the volleyball dispute period, after the important staff of the conference came to the scene to supervise the replay, it seemed that it had been resolved, The meaning of the general audience is that, in terms of the referee, there should be a legitimate protest procedure for the referee's fairness, and they must not start to beat and insult, This is fundamentally contradictory to the original purpose of promoting sports ethics, Even taking a step back, sports should be coordinated in a body that is in line with the right track, and starting to use force is not a problem in the sports meeting itself, and may not need to be裁制, However, not only will the dignity and discipline style of the conference be swept away, but also in terms of the position of the law, there are still those who cannot be satisfied, Now the conference has resolved the final issue of the competition, and there is no way to deal with the enforcement of this transgression, which makes the conference leave a bad impression, which is really not taken, Moreover, this problem, in the belief of the referee system itself, is related, and the conference's attitude to deal with the matter is another problem,</p>

<p>The final match between the Shanghai team and the Guangdong second team was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The Shanghai team's technique was already masterful, and we were confident that the championship was already within their grasp. Yesterday's match did not disappoint our expectations. In the end, they sailed smoothly to victory, defeating the Guangdong team with a score of 48 to 26 and taking home the championship.</p>
<p>A Smooth Sailing</p>
<p>After the two semi-final matches for men concluded, the women's armies of Shanghai and Guangdong, armed and ready, stepped onto the stage. They chose their positions. Chen Rongming, the captain of the Shanghai team, and Liu Mali, the captain of the Guangdong team, were old friends, but now they became enemies. They shook hands briefly, showing respect before the battle. The Chinese jump ball marked the start of the fierce battle. Chen Jia gathered her talent and, without hesitation, scored two points with a well-aimed throw. Rong Xianhong got a free throw opportunity and scored with one attempt. Captain Rongming of the battle formation displayed her power early on. Huang Huier attempted a half-court shot and also scored successfully. The Chen family pressed their advantage further, taking the lead in the first quarter with a score of 14 to 7. In the second quarter, Rong Xianhong left the court for a short rest. Both sides scored some points, bringing the score to 24 to 13, with the Shanghai army leading comfortably in the first half.</p>
<p>Night Battle Under Bright Lights</p>
<p>At this time, dusk had already fallen. Inside the stadium, the lights were brightly lit, shining like daylight. After drinking lemonade, the Guangdong army reorganized and launched a counterattack. Huang Huier displayed her prowess, scoring twice with accurate shots. Rong Xianhong made a comeback, contributing to the effort, and narrowed the score to 24 to 19, the closest margin in yesterday's match. However, good times do not last, and the full moon easily wanes. The Chen family once again unleashed their strength. Chen and Pan coordinated their attacks, creating a score of 26 to 20. Although the Guangdong team tried hard to reverse the situation, it was futile as the three armies advanced, and the front gate was blocked, preventing the wolf from entering. In the end, the score became 37 to 24. The Guangdong team, seeing that the situation was hopeless, lost the will to fight. The Shanghai army, amidst cheers, won the championship with a score of 48 to 26.</p>
<p>News from the Ball Line</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, the Shanghai team played flawlessly, without any flaws. Chen Rongming's individual technique is unmatched among women in the country, and even men of lesser skill would be ashamed in comparison. When it comes to awarding merit, she should undoubtedly take the top spot. The left and right forwards were like green leaves complementing a peony. Chen Jucai was particularly energetic yesterday. Although the defender Chen Baixue is a "short tiger," her ball-stealing and passing skills were outstanding. Jin钗婉卿 can be called a "double difficulty." In short, there were no weak players in the entire team. The Guangdong army's technique can also be ranked among the top teams. The long shots of the Huang and Rong forwards were remarkably accurate. Center Liu Mali was physically strong and excellent at jump balls. It's a pity that the defenders' vision was weak, which prevented them from defending against the sharp Shanghai forwards and resulted in defeat.</p>

<p>The Fujian women's basketball team, after unfortunately being defeated by the Guangdong team, was forced to compete with the Jiangsu team, which had been eliminated in the semi-finals, for third and fourth place. The match was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Fujian team had come with the ambition to win the championship, but they were unexpectedly eliminated, and a sense of resentment lingered overnight. In yesterday's match against Jiangsu, the Jiangsu team's will was low, and they responded casually. They were almost caught off guard at the beginning, but they finally brought out their best skills in the second half and gained the upper hand. The Jiangsu army showed a spirited performance yesterday, with well-organized offense and defense, a stark contrast to their panicked attitude when playing against Shanghai. However, their overall strength was still inferior, and they had to settle for fourth place.</p>
<p>After the silver whistle blew, Huang Lianzhen went straight into enemy territory and scored the first basket. Zhang Xu and Yi Jiang used both hands and took the lead with a score of 8 to 2. The Fujian team was greatly surprised and called a timeout to avoid their sharp offense. Xu Lin, the forward, continuously recovered several balls, and the first quarter ended in a 11-11 tie. During the second quarter, the competition between the two sides was intense. After the Fujian team scored two baskets, Zhang Ruiqin also made a long shot. Xu Xinxi again showed her skill and gave the Fujian team a small lead of 18 to 13 at the end of the first half. After switching sides, the Fujian team attacked steadily, and their score soared. On the other hand, the Jiangsu team gained nothing, and their line was disorganized. It was not until the last five minutes that they began to resist strongly and scored a few points. However, it was too late, and they were defeated by a score of 18 to 40.</p>

<p>The four teams of Peiping, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hebei, who won the right to the men's basketball semi-finals, held the semi-finals yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. The stadium was packed with people, breaking the highest record for the number of spectators. Yesterday's battle of the four strong teams was like a fight between dragons and tigers, shaking the mountains and changing the color of the wind and clouds. As a result, both Peiping and Shanghai won first and then lost. The right to the finals was won by the southern and eastern Hebei teams. The finals are scheduled to be held today. Both sides have their own strengths. It is still uncertain who will win. The two teams of Peiping and Shanghai, who failed in the semi-finals, are scheduled to compete for third and fourth place at 1:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Peiping Suffers a Miserable Elimination Hebei Wins the Right to the Finals</p>
<p>The Hebei vs. Peiping semi-final was held yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Peiping is mostly composed of veteran players from the battlefield, while Hebei is composed of recently emerging talents. Although both sides have northern-style play, tight defense and fast offense, each advancing and retreating, the competition was fierce. The Hebei team performed particularly well yesterday. Center Liu Shicheng relied on his tall stature to gain many advantages. Wang's shot was accurate, and his speed was fast. Li Shaotang was loyal to his duties, taking care of both inside and outside. Peiping's Mou Zuoyun and Yu Jingxiao often had extremely beautiful passes, but because of</p>
<p>Poor Ball Luck</p>
<p>Their baskets often missed. Later, Mou Zuoyun fought with injuries, and Li Heding and Zhang Yunshu were penalized and removed from the court, which was a fatal blow to Peiping. Yi Ligotang and Liu Shiming took the stage, but they had already abandoned their own duties, and the rear was empty. The enemy took advantage of the situation and entered the void, which led to the failure. Otherwise, it is not known who would have won. At the beginning of the war, both sides kept a close watch, and it was not easy to steal the camp. Each took advantage of the opportunity to score points with free throws. Then Mou Zuoyun</p>
<p>Light Cavalry Raids Secretly</p>
<p>Gained merit and welcomed Wang Youcai back. Peiping stopped the war, still unfavorable, and the Peiping score continued to lead, from sixteen to thirteen to eighteen to fifteen. The Peiping team finally won the first half with two points to twenty to fifteen. When the gold was struck, the two Wangs scored repeatedly, creating twenty to twenty-two, only two points behind Peiping. The Peiping team also followed suit, suspending the war, but the Hebei team</p>
<p>Arrogance Outbursts</p>
<p>Mou Zuoyun fought with injuries, Liu Shicheng took advantage of the opportunity to attack, and returned to twenty-six to twenty-four ahead. At this time, Peiping generals Zhang Tingkui and Li Heding were penalized and retired from the field, and no one succeeded him. Liu Shiming made mistakes and missed the opportunity. The Hebei team was already climbing high, creating forty-six to thirty. Although the Peiping team tried to return to the attack, there was limited time. The Hebei team read and kept their homes, and the gates were as deep as the sea. The Peiping team finally had difficulty entering the room, and was miserably eliminated with thirty-six to forty-nine.</p>

<p>Nanjing Defeats Shanghai, Shanghai Army Wins First, Loses Later</p>
<p>The battle between Nanjing and Shanghai began after the Peiping-Hebei shirt match. The Nanjing team was in a state of panic when it first came on the field, and its performance was extremely bad. Li Zhenzhong, who is famous for his accurate shooting, was at a loss in the first half, and was almost plotted against by the Shanghai team. In the second half, everything went smoothly and everything went smoothly, eliminating the Shanghai army with forty-two to twenty-eight and winning the right to the final.</p>
<p>In Danger of Not Being Buried with Dai's Malfunction</p>
<p>When the two armies came into contact, the long-legged deer committed a foul. Li center scored a penalty, and Chen Xianglong also got a free throw opportunity, and immediately achieved equality. Lu Zhongen got the pass from Xiao Feng, and the long arm raised the ball into the basket. Feng Baohua stole and touched it, and also got a ball. Eight to two was already ahead. The Beijing team got five free throw opportunities before and after, but they were panicked and did not score a single ball. After many battles, Nan Zhen Ye Di touched the peach and could connect in one shot. Tang Baokun supported a ball in a very difficult and difficult environment, and Zhang Changjiang followed up with his success. Gao Changming shot from a distance and scored points, and he began to catch up with nine to thirteen. Xiao Li initially showed his color, one penalty and one connection, plus three points, Li Gongyu Yi Changqing four places, and the monk's head killing method was powerful, chasing fifteen equal. Changjiao Lu also penalized one point, and the Shanghai team also won the first half with sixteen to fifteen.</p>
<p>Sleeping Lion Awakes and Water Flows</p>
<p>After switching places, Feng Baohua scored one point first, and the Beijing rear guard was far away from the defense, and Nan Zhen took the opportunity to fill up and became nineteen to fifteen. Changjiao suddenly reported four fouls and was forced to dismiss his post. The Beijing team went to a strong enemy, and Li Zhenzhong began to be active, chasing each other nineteen and a half, and Xiao Li showed his power, calling Baopi Pass, and Wu Wenzhong also repeatedly attacked, and the score jumped to the rear, from twenty-six to twenty-one to thirty-four to twenty-two. Sun Baoqing saw that the situation was not good, and the lone army went deep, and only then did he get a merit. Xiao Tang was delighted to see the hunter, and the bull knife was a small test, and the water came to fruition. Yin Guiren tried to turn the tide, adding two points, and Wu Shixuan also joined in the heat, and nothing was unfavorable. Finally, Xiao Li built a success and closed the door. As soon as the gong rang, on the scoreboard, Gao County forty-two to two-eight, Nanjing won the right to the finals.</p>
<p>Beijing School Personnel Methods Always Prevail</p>
<p>Looking at yesterday's battle situation, the Nanjing team still used the usual Beijing school style of play, working hard and doing practical work. Although they felt a little panicked when they first came on the stage, they soon stabilized the lineup, not panicking, defending like a virgin, and going out like a rabbit. Xiao Tang was qualified and experienced, specializing in transportation, not thinking about shooting, and often causing the other party to foul. Shanghai Lu Chen two generals left the scene, mostly eating at his expense. Li Zhenzhong was not good at the beginning, but after entering Hou Xian's color, the rear guard Wu Wenzhong was quite outstanding yesterday, but he often rushed out, and the rear felt empty, so Xiao Tang looked back from time to time and made up for the lack. The Shanghai team performed extremely well yesterday, and Sun Baoqing, Feng Nianhua and Lu Zhongen performed beautifully. It is a pity that Lao Lu was fined out of the scene, otherwise, who will be the championship, is still a question.</p>

<p>The men's tennis singles championship is scheduled to be resolved today by Xu Chengmou and Qiu Feihai in the final. The doubles final was held yesterday, and the Shanghai-Ma semi-final was also changed to be held yesterday morning. Shanghai's Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai first defeated strong enemy Ma Hua, Lin Wang Su Ruanying, and then defeated Java's Xu Chengji and Xu Chengwei in one day, winning the doubles championship, so the tennis championship will also be steadily won by Shanghai, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>Shanghai Steadily Wins Championship</p>
<p>Since the singles and doubles reached the semi-final week, the tennis championship has become interesting, because the singles championship can be explored by Xu Chengji, and Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai are allowed to get second or third place, and the key to the championship is all in doubles. Ma Hua Lin Wang Su Ruanying has a frightening reputation, and in view of the annihilation of the entire army in singles, he will definitely try to win the final victory in doubles. Java Er Xu is unanimously recognized as the strongest combination. Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai want to win the tennis championship for Shanghai, and they must win the doubles championship, but Lin Ruan looks at the tiger in front, and Er Xu spies behind, and there are many difficulties, how easy it is to talk about, Lin Qiu endured hard and persevered to the end, and sure enough, he collected Ma Hua and defeated Java again, so the doubles championship is in hand, and the tennis championship is also no problem. Lin Baohua worked especially hard and performed particularly well. As he wished, he worked hard and made great contributions. Lin Jun Gu Ying smiled, and Qiu Jun was also proud. Although Java won the unit championship, even if he won the doubles second place again, he would still hope for the championship.</p>
<p>Today's Singles Final</p>
<p>The difficult ones to get to the singles final are Java Xu Chengji and Shanghai Qiu Feihai. They are scheduled to fight each other this afternoon. Xu's victory is definitely no problem.

<p>The men's tennis doubles semi-final was originally scheduled to be held on the 16th, but due to time constraints, except for a game between Java and Sichuan, which was allowed to be played on schedule, the Shanghai-Ma battle was changed to be replayed at 9:00 AM yesterday. Both sides were evenly matched, and the competition was extremely fierce. After a fierce battle of four or four, Shanghai reversed the defeat and eliminated Ma Hua, and won the right to the final.</p>
<p>Snipe Sharply</p>
<p>The success yesterday was all thanks to this gentleman. Ruan Guoying's skills are very good, and the merits and demerits offset each other. Lin Wangsu seems weak, and the high pressure is not inferior. Qiu Feihai is old and has yellowed pearls, and has no ability to control the first set. The Shanghai team won a game first, and then went downhill. Although Baohua was brave, he could not support the building alone, and was killed by the Ma Hua team, losing the first set with one to six. In the first set, Lin Qiu calmly responded and made a big counterattack. The veteran's skills were extraordinary, and he took the lead with two to zero. Ma Hua heroes were not willing to show weakness, and returned the same way. Then Ma Lin made repeated mistakes, and the Shanghai team added two games in a row, and finally won a set with six to three.</p>
<p>Create Equilibrium</p>
<p>In the third set, Lao Qiu still did not improve, and baseball suicide was common. Fortunately, Shihua worked especially hard and stood alone to support the remaining game. After the handshake between each other, Lao Qiu suddenly turned around, and his luck was prosperous. On the Ma Hua side, it was seen that the casual Wang Su was even weaker. Five to three Shanghai team took the lead. In the ninth game, Lin Qiu took the lead with forty-five to zero, and if he won another point, he could get this set. Ruan Lin repeatedly saved dangerous balls, and was able to chase into equality, and was finally won by Ma Hua, becoming five to four. The Shanghai team encouraged the remaining bravery, and won another game, and won a set with six to four.</p>
<p>Come from Behind</p>
<p>After resting and fighting again, the Shanghai team won first and then won, and the momentum suddenly increased. Ma Hua drooped his head and lost his will. Lin Qiu took the lead, three to one, five to, occupied the position, unexpectedly Lin Qiu carelessly lost Jingzhou, three consecutive, Bai killed under the net, Ruan Lin took the opportunity to take advantage of, desperately chasing, unexpectedly,</p>
<p>Three Yuan Lianzhong</p>
<p>Creating each five and Zhou, the situation suddenly became tense, when the tenth game Qiu Lin had many opportunities to win, but Lao Qiu's old illness relapsed and was incurable, and became a draw. Next, Ruan served poorly, and the Shanghai team took the lead again with six to five. In the last game, Lin Baohua happened to serve, and then he showed great power and frequently applied "live work one, to get the light game, and the Shanghai team won the fourth set with seven to five, and eliminated Ma,</p>

<p>The men's doubles winner is Shanghai Lin Baohua Qiu Feihai, and Java Xu Chengji Xu Chengwei, who fought for the championship at 3:00 PM yesterday, and Xu's ball skills are surpassing, especially Chengji is even better. His cannonball serve, the top high pressure as heavy as Mount Tai, and the extremely urgent positive and negative draw and hit, are unique in the country. His brother Chengwei's serve and high pressure are similar to Chengji's, but the lack of experience and panic on the spot. Yesterday's tragic defeat was also due to this. Lin Qiu's old general's power has not diminished in the past. Lin has been fighting hard for days, and his hands and feet have been slightly injured, and yesterday he created a scene and performed particularly well, splitting and killing, drawing and pressing, and he was so quick and saved countless dangerous balls. Qiu's performance has declined in ball skills, although he has gone through hardships and reached the final week, but it still took a lot of effort. Who knows that yesterday, Zhan Mi, was energetic and changed the state of fatigue and listlessness in the past, and matched with Lin, Zhu Lianbihe, impeccable, and took the strong enemy lightly with a straight three, Rongju chief, it is unexpected that Shanghai's winning the tennis championship is no problem, and who will win the total championship is also the unexpected gain of solving Shanghai's sincerely</p>
<p>Strike First</p>
<p>Before the competition, Mr. Zhang Zizhen, Shanghai tennis coach, thought that Lin Qiu had been fighting for days and was exhausted, and his performance was not outstanding, and he was afraid that he would not be an enemy of the two Xu, and he could not bear to see the tragic defeat, so he went far away, unexpectedly, after the start of the game, the two Xu played the pipa and made mistakes. Lin Qiu broke the boat and was not in a hurry, and lost two games in a row. Afterwards, the two Xu continued to tend to calm down, and gradually entered a better state, and from time to time they went online to block and kill, and used clever and unparalleled interceptions to suppress the enemy's life. Although Lin Qiu used high balls to embarrass the enemy, he made a fool of himself and gave Er Xu a chance for high pressure, and hit the key points from time to time. Three to two, four to three, the two Xu jumped to the forefront. Lin Qiu's old general was not weak, and in a moment he returned the color, creating each four draw. In the next game, Chengji served, and the victory could be manipulated, but he was eager to win, and there were many mistakes. Then he was too hasty, and baseball was seen repeatedly, so Lin Qiu got the game, and in the tenth game, the victory or defeat was tied, and each did not give way. Both sides went online, and the short soldiers met, and the sound of splitting and shooting was endless. You came and I went, it was very good-looking. Lin Qiu finally won the final victory with a calm attitude, and won the first set with six to four, and won the first place.</p>
<p>Work Hard Again</p>
<p>In the sound of fighting again, Er Xu shook his spirits and fought bravely back, Lin Qiu did not relax at all, and followed suit, so the battle situation was even more intense, long and short hits, and wonderful miscellaneous presentations, each one each two, and each three, always close to the left and right, the next game Xiao Xu served, and lost twice in a row, Xuan Lin went online again, and showed his best masterpiece, and won the victory with two wonderful interceptions, and then added a game, Lin Qiu was far ahead with five to two, Er Xu relied on high pressure to pull back a game, and finally lost again with four to six,</p>
<p>Lay the Foundation</p>
<p>In the third set, Lin Qiu had the victory in hand and saw more stable, Lao Qiu also had excellent performances from time to time, and Er Xu was at a loss, and made more mistakes. Although his best high pressure was also too hasty, he frequently committed suicide under the net, while Lin Qiu was radiant and imposing. After the start, he went smoothly all the way, and took an absolute advantage with a three-to-one game. Er Xu tried his best to catch up and won back a game, but the crazy tide was falling, and he wanted to save it from being unable to do so. Lin Qiu made progress step by step and sang a triumphal song with three consecutive stages and a six-to-two high, and won the most glorious doubles championship.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Women's 400-Meter Relay Issue Resolved; Beijing Team Also Disqualified; Qualification of Beijing Athlete Yang Chunfu Under Investigation; Two Improvements to Be Implemented for Future Relay Finals <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the women's 400-meter relay, both the Beijing and Shanghai teams ran out of their lanes. Following Shanghai's protest, the judging committee convened to discuss the matter. The third meeting was held at the general affairs office of the sports field yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. Attending were the committee chairman Zhang Boling, members Wang Zhengting, Shen Siliang, Song Ruhai, Qiu Jixiang, Hao Gengsheng, Zhang Huilan, Chen Kun, Chen Kui Sheng, Chu Minyi, Dong Shouyi, Chen Menghai, and the general leader of the Beijing team, Li Zhou, who was invited to attend for consultation.</p>
<p>Differing Opinions</p>
<p>After the meeting commenced, the chairman first read out the key points of Shanghai's protest: (1) The Shanghai team was disqualified from the women's 400-meter relay due to running out of their lane. However, the Beijing team, which also ran out of their lane, has not been officially disqualified, which seems unfair. (2) In the all-around athletics 400-meter relay race, Nanjing athlete Yang Chunfu participated in the Jiangsu first district preliminary round. Please investigate and disqualify him. A discussion then began. Regarding the first point, some committee members believed that the photo evidence from Wang Kai proved that the Beijing team did run out of their lane. However, because a Shanghai team member encroached on their lane, the Beijing team members were forced to run into another lane, so their mistake was understandable. Other committee members argued that the Beijing team members should have reported the Shanghai team's encroachment on their lane to the inspectors on the spot during the race and requested a re-run. They should not have also run into another lane. Now that they have also violated the rules, they should of course be disqualified according to the regulations.</p>
<p>Decision to Disqualify</p>
<p>After much discussion, it was decided to disqualify the Beijing team. Regarding the second point, it was generally agreed that if Nanjing athlete Yang Chunfu participated in the preliminary rounds for two units, his qualification to participate in the games should be cancelled. According to the joint notice from the competition and judging committees to the general leaders of each unit, they should self-report any issues with their athletes' qualifications. If they do not self-report and are discovered, the entire team will be disqualified, even if only one person is unqualified. Therefore, the qualification of the entire 400-meter relay team should be cancelled. However, there is no conclusive evidence at this time whether Yang Chunfu participated in the preliminary rounds for two units. A decision will be made based on the actual situation after investigation. The discussion concluded around 11:00 AM. The committee's resolution was as follows: "Since the Shanghai team was disqualified for running out of their lane, and the photo shows that the Beijing team also ran out of their lane, they should also be disqualified." The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Two Lessons Learned</p>
<p>After the committee members Zhang Boling, Wang Zhengting, and others settled the case, they proposed two points based on the experience of this dispute to improve future rules: (1) When defining the lanes, the number of lanes used should correspond to the number of teams participating, with no empty lanes in between to avoid lane infringement. (2) The lane numbers should also be clearly marked at the turns. These proposals were unanimously approved. It was also heard that the committee has now settled the two protest issues raised by the Shanghai team and will reply to the team by letter. (Note that the women's 400-meter relay was originally sixth place. Due to the Shanghai team being disqualified, it rose to fifth place. Now that it has also been disqualified, only four teams have placed: first place to the Guangdong team, second place to the Malaya team, third place to the Qingdao team, and fourth place to the Fujian team. Fifth and sixth places are vacant.)</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 18th) Chairman Chen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission dispatched Chen Chunpu, the director of the Overseas Chinese Education Department of the Commission, to Shanghai on the 18th to invite the overseas Chinese athlete delegations from Malaya, Java, and the Philippines to visit Beijing after the games. The original letter stated: "You have traveled far and wide to return to the motherland, demonstrating your heartfelt patriotism. Your impressive achievements have added luster to the games. The Commission, responsible for overseas Chinese affairs, has always been concerned about the education of overseas Chinese youth. Promoting sports and strengthening physical fitness are essential for the revival of the nation. Your understanding of this is deeply gratifying. After the closing ceremony of the games, the Commission plans to invite you to visit Beijing to see the political and economic construction of the motherland in recent years, so that you can gain a deeper understanding. Please inform us of your departure date two days in advance so that we can prepare."</p>

<p>The Philippine Chinese Overseas delegation traveled a long way to return to the country to participate in the National Games. The men's basketball team had considerable strength and fought through many matches before being eliminated by Nanjing in the semi-finals. However, their overall appearance was very good. The general leader of the team did not come this time. According to team captain Mr. Yang, the team is now committed to an engagement in Hankou and will prepare to perform there after the closing ceremony of the games. If this cannot be arranged, they plan to return to the Philippines on the 21st. He also stated that the team spent a long time preparing to return to the country for the games, with the sole purpose of connecting with compatriots in the country and dispelling any doubts that we have abandoned the motherland. Therefore, they traveled thousands of miles to come and observed many sporting events, which was very beneficial. However, in the film taken at this games, each province and city unit was included, and the movements and lives of athletes from Malaya were even more detailed, but the Philippine team was not included. Perhaps this was an oversight by the organizing committee, but if this film is shown to the overseas Chinese in the Philippines, it will create a negative impression of the team. Therefore, they feel great regret.</p>

The games have now been rescheduled to the 20th (10:00 AM), 22nd (4:00 PM), 24th (4:00 PM), and 27th (4:00 PM). It has been heard that Mayor Wu has prepared four silver cups for the competition and will personally present the awards on the 27th. It has also been heard that after this competition, the polo team will perform in Beijing next month at the invitation of Chu Minyi and Huang Renlin.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Governor Huang Shaoxiong has always been enthusiastic about sports and particularly fond of tennis. Governor Huang also came to Shanghai to attend the opening of this National Games, but regretted not being able to see the whole picture due to busy political affairs. Since most of the tennis players from Malaya and Guangdong have finished their matches, Huang sent a telegram to Chen Qihao yesterday, which read: "Chen Qihao, I would be very pleased to welcome the Malayan and Guangdong tennis players to Hangzhou to perform. Huang Shaoxiong." However, since Lin Wangsu and Ruan Guoying still need to compete today, Chen Qihao accompanied Chen Qi'an and Guangdong's Li Guangjun on the night train to Hangzhou last night to stay for a day or two before performing.</p>

<p>During a recent meeting, the Municipal Council's Education Committee discussed the issue of subsidies for private Chinese schools. Prior to the meeting, the Municipal Council's Health Department submitted a report on the sanitation facilities of various private schools. The report stated that the sanitation facilities of 180 schools were up to standard and should be given subsidies. The date for issuing the subsidies is scheduled for around the second Friday after the end of each [quarter]. After these measures were approved by the Education Committee, all schools that have paid the Municipal Council's universal housing tax, have sanitary facilities up to standard, or are temporarily considered to be up to standard, can apply for subsidies. The Education Committee also drafted the following four measures to be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval: (1) In addition to the third-quarter subsidies for this year, the subsidies for the three schools that were previously rated as substandard should be temporarily suspended. Now that they have improved in accordance with the regulations of the Health Department, they should be paid retroactively. (2) The subsidies for the five substandard schools and the schools that are in arrears with the Municipal Council's universal housing tax should be temporarily suspended. (3) In accordance with the regulations, starting from the time when the subsidies should be obtained, the subsidies will no longer be issued to those who fail to improve their facilities in accordance with the regulations of the Health Department within six months. (4) Currently, one Chinese school is not located within the Public Concession, and its autumn subsidy will not be issued for the time being. It will be deferred to the next meeting, when the director of the Education Department will submit a detailed report for further review. All of the above proposed measures have been approved by the Municipal Council's Board of Directors at its recent regular meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e260">What Modern Chinese Women Need is a New Morality <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Mrs. Han, wife of the Provincial Governor of Shandong, and others, having recently observed that modern Chinese women either vainly pursue frivolousness and lack self-discipline, abandoning their inherent responsibilities, or are weak, incompetent, and ignorant, stubbornly adhering to outdated customs, resulting in the near-total burying of the old Zhou dynasty morality, the obliteration of the true spirit of women, the more developed women's rights become, the more decadent life becomes, the more advanced civilization becomes, the more corrupt customs become. If this situation is not urgently rectified, advocating for women's rights will only serve to undermine them, and the world's ingrained concept of valuing men over women will never be eliminated. In order to correct these bad habits of women and revive women's morality, a special alliance has been formed with enlightened women from all walks of life to establish the Shandong Women's Morality Promotion Association, with the aim of improving women's lives.</p>
<p>"Modern Chinese women, those who embrace modernity, vainly pursue frivolousness and lack self-discipline, abandoning their inherent responsibilities," this is the truth. "Those who adhere to tradition are weak, incompetent, and ignorant, stubbornly adhering to outdated customs," this is also the truth. But why is this the case? To put it bluntly: this is caused by the old Chinese morality! Because Chinese women have always lived under the shackles of old morality, without any freedom. Therefore, those who embrace modernity, once exposed to new ideas, must be unrestrained and domineering. Those who adhere to tradition, being ignorant and uneducated, can only stubbornly adhere to outdated customs. Therefore, the way to remedy this is to fundamentally overthrow the old morality and rebuild a new morality for women to follow. This is the only solution. Otherwise, the lives of Chinese women will probably never have any hope of improvement! However, the Shandong Women's Morality Promotion Association is lamenting the burying of inherent morality and wants to use the means of restoring women's morality to improve women's lives. This is a mistake.</p>
<p>Speaking of the issue of women's rights, this is what modern Chinese women must strive for. Because Chinese women's rights have long been deprived of them! However, the Shandong Women's Morality Promotion Association says, "The more developed women's rights become, the more decadent life becomes, the more advanced civilization becomes, the more corrupt customs become." Originally, in present-day China, women do not even have women's rights to speak of, let alone development? Even if Chinese women's rights have made considerable progress, this should not lead to the decadence of women's lives. The lives of modern Chinese women are indeed decadent in some aspects. However, this is definitely not the fault of the development of women's rights, but rather another factor that leads to this decadence. Moreover, this is only the case for a small number of Chinese women. Is it really that women's rights are undesirable? The Shandong Women's Morality Promotion Association believes that "If this situation is not urgently rectified, advocating for women's rights will only serve to undermine them, and some people's concept of valuing men over women will never be eliminated." Then, may I ask, will restoring women's morality guarantee women's rights and eliminate the concept of valuing men over women? The reason why Chinese women today do not have women's rights and why the world values men over women is all due to the influence of the old morality!</p>
<p>In short, the organization of the Shandong Women's Morality Promotion Association is either intentionally regressive or taking the wrong path. Let us reiterate here. In the future, if we want to improve the lives of Chinese women, it lies not in restoring the old morality, but in establishing a new morality!</p>
<h3 id="e261">Flower House <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Xiong</p>
<p>In the courtyard of the new residence, a row of parasol trees is planted along the steps. They stand tall with their upright, thick trunks, higher than the roof of the building. In summer, their lush, dense leaves spread out like umbrellas, seemingly covering the top of the building, blocking the scorching sunlight and bringing gentle breezes. When the leaves sway, they create beautiful patterns on the windows, making one feel that the summer sun also has its charm.</p>
<p>The host of the residence is an elder of about fifty years old. He lives here alone in solitude, accompanied by a child who enjoys catching cicadas and butterflies. I met him for the first time through a friend's introduction. He said he was very happy to have a cohabitant like me, as he felt too lonely. He gave me the impression of a recluse who had suffered a great shock.</p>
<p>The old man loves flowers as if they were his life, and there are hundreds of flowerpots arranged in the courtyard. The child is very experienced in planting flowers, and every morning he helps the host to divide branches, cultivate soil, water plants, and catch insects, acting with a care unlike his usual lively and playful self. Later, I learned that he was the son of the gardener who had previously been employed by the host.</p>
<p>Because of his love for flowers, the host specially used the strength of the parasol tree's trunk and branches to build a pergola that could cover the entire courtyard, covered with reed mats, which could be rolled up like a curtain. Naturally, this was also the child's responsibility.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The host cares very much for the child. In ordinary conversations, he often acts like a little master. He often laments not having the money to build an exquisite flower house, saying, "That child is too hardworking. He serves these flowers without ever making a mistake!"</p>
<p>When I am idle, I lean against the window and watch the two of them touching and feeling in the courtyard, meticulously inspecting each pot. When they discover a diseased flower, they discuss it, considering how to treat and nurse it, often unable to make a decision for a long time. Then the host raises his head and speaks to me:</p>
<p>"Planting flowers is very interesting, but I hate those insects. There's simply no way to deal with them. You can't catch them all, and watching them die is like watching my own son die..."</p>
<p>He always shakes his head at the end, saying, "If only I could build a flower house!"</p>
<p>Then he strolls up to my room and pulls me to "play a game of chess." The host's chess skills are not very good. He loses to me nine times out of ten. And at this time, he loses even faster. After only a few moves, he pushes the chessboard away, saying, "I lost again," and strolls back to the courtyard.</p>
<p>The child, however, is capable. He sits on the steps, holding his head in his hands. He tries to search for planting experience from a corner of his little brain, or perhaps a story that his father told him that could revive the diseased flower. He sits there for a long time, unwilling to leave. Even if the host urges him, he will come up with various methods to rekindle the host's interest, and the two of them will go back to treating them.</p>
<p>This kind of situation happens often, and each time the child manages to revive the diseased flower.</p>
<p>After living here for a long time, the child and I became very close. One day, while we were fishing by the pond, I asked him about his planting experience, which led him to tell me the host's story:</p>
<p>The child has lived in the host's home since he was little. The host used to be an official and had a vast fortune. His old wife passed away early, and he had an only son, who squandered the host's wealth and was imprisoned for theft. So the host retreated to this only residence on the outskirts. He originally hired a gardener to decorate the garden of his mansion, priding himself on collecting and planting rare flowers in his garden to show off his wealth. Now he uses planting flowers to pass the lonely rest of his life. If a flower that is not worth a penny dies, he will scold his son all day long, to the point of neglecting food and sleep and becoming ill. "So," the child said, "when a diseased flower is discovered, I always try my best to save it. The host loves me dearly, and I can't bear to see him in his manic state."</p>
<p>I am glad that the host has such a loyal servant, but when I hear him say "If only I could build a flower house," I don't know what to say.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Passing Skirt Belt Mountain at Night <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Wu</p>
<p>The sun has shrunk its head below the mountainside, and a burst of rosy glow reflects half of the mountains. The trails in the mountain depressions are gradually becoming sparse, and the gurgling sound of running water is still clearly reaching the ears. The pine forests and wild thorns appear particularly vibrant in the sunset glow. The mountain pits are as deep as bottomless pools. Everyone no longer dares to admire the scenery near or far, but focuses on carefully steadying their steps, fearing that a misstep will send them rolling into the mountain pit. At the same time, they are also fearful of the steep Skirt Belt Mountain ahead, where the mountain rats (a euphemism for bandits) are known for their ruthless methods, chilling the hearts of all who hear of them.</p>
<p>"Brother Zhuang, we who make a living this way are truly risking our lives. I'm really worried about Little Gouzi. He doesn't have a father, and his mother is truly suffering. You must take care of him on the road. He's young and doesn't know the dangers, and he'll rush ahead... If—alas, Uncle Huang said that those mountain rats won't let anyone off easily. They're afraid that a boss might be disguised as a porter. How could a group like ours not have someone with something of value?... Really, the mention of embroidered knives (a type of killing) is terrifying!... It's truly a 'nine deaths and one life.' I'm afraid not even one in ten can return safely!..." As I walked here, I couldn't help but recall Little Gouzi's mother's nagging requests every time we set off. The surrounding mountains are so towering and steep, and the road is so narrow. At every turn, or in the chaotic piles of long grass, those mountain rats could be lurking at any time. If we don't run into them, it will be our good luck. In the past, someone tried to set fire to the wild grass in the mountains, hoping to deprive the mountain rats of hiding places, but instead they were captured by the mountain rats and forced to undergo embroidered knives. How pitiful! To make a living on this road that treads the line between life and death!</p>
<p>"Little Gouzi! Pick up the pace, why are you dragging along like a sheep pulling an old ox? Aren't you afraid of falling behind in battle?"</p>
<p>As we slowly climbed up the dangerous road on Skirt Belt Mountain, Little Gouzi gradually slowed down. Old Song yelled at him casually. I turned back to take a quick glance. He really did look like an ant, struggling to walk, his timid eyes looking forward and then back. I couldn't help but urge him, "Little Gouzi, cheer up and hurry along. No one is going to wait for you!"</p>
<p>This young man, Little Gouzi, is not as his mother described him: someone who is unaware of the dangers. In our group, he is the youngest, but also the most timid. He always lags behind, and he never moves to the front unless his companions urge him repeatedly. He really doesn't seem like a young man!...</p>
<p>As we walked on the narrow road of the skirt belt, the sun had already set behind the mountain and was dozing off. The moon had not yet risen, and the surroundings were already a deep, dark sea of night. A few stars were trying hard to widen their eyes, but the mountain path was still shrouded in darkness. The chirping of insects, which had begun to fill the mountains and fields after sunset, now reached our ears even more clearly. Occasionally, there were also some "whoosh, whoosh" sounds as the mountain wind scoured through the trees. The sound was desolate and monotonous. Old Bamboo Head often said that this was a sign of tigers or mountain rats coming, but in reality, nothing ever happened afterwards. Sometimes, it was probably the cries of mountain birds, which made Old Bamboo Head suspect it was the crying of ghosts: "Unjustly wronged, I will know. I will burn paper money for you when I get back tonight, don't cry, let us walk well!... We have heard him murmuring and chanting like this more than once. Song Sen always deliberately joked with him: "Old Uncle Bamboo, she doesn't want your paper money, she wants you to be her companion. It's a female ghost!" Or, "He's not married yet. Bring your daughter tomorrow. We'll make her the Land Goddess of Skirt Belt Mountain!"</p>
<p>But as soon as Song Sen said this, Old Bamboo Head would shake his gray head and scold, "You'll be beheaded, there'll be retribution, how can you talk such nonsense? Toilet paper to wipe your mouth!"</p>
<p>But after Song Sen made a joke, everyone laughed heartily, and their hearts lightened. The Skirt Belt Mountain pass became much easier to cross.</p>
<p>The night was silent. In the bright moonlight, we slowly climbed from the top of the mountain to the bottom of the depression, crossing one mountain after another. We ourselves seemed like ghosts, forgetting that we still had a life.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Jiangnan <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>—One of the Scattered Southern Travels—</p>
<p>Before I came to Jiangnan, my heart longed for Jiangnan as one longs for the wilderness; when I saw the wilderness, I longed for the wilderness of Jiangnan as one longs for Jiangnan.</p>
<p>The people in the third-class carriage were either quietly flipping through magazines or their favorite novels, or discussing current events with those sitting next to them. Still others were discussing the beauty of women.</p>
<p>My surroundings were empty, not even a single person. Their conversations rarely affected my thoughts. So I had plenty of leisure to think about some questions. Most of these questions arose from other people's conversations. My head was close to the window, watching the undulating land outside, and my tired heart was quieted by the sound of the train wheels.</p>
<p>When I was in school, I heard a teacher say that Jiangnan is beautiful. He was an aesthetic poet, and he said that in Nanjing, if you go to Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum and Taicheng, and look around, almost all you see is lush greenery. He even recited his poetry:</p>
<p>Whose family's oil sea has burst its banks,</p>
<p>The wilderness of Jiangnan is all green and oily.</p>
<p>A girl in green goes in without a trace,</p>
<p>A branch of red peach blooms, dreamlike and free!</p>
<p>Therefore, I dreamed that the wilderness of Jiangnan was a vast sea of green, with soft, grassy meadows spreading out across the vast plains, as vibrant and luminous as flowing velvet. The mountains and soil were also like this, looking like waterfalls about to flow down, the whole mountain being a huge piece of glass.</p>
<p>So, I thought of this scene. My head rested on the window, watching the endless road recede into the distance.</p>
<p>At this moment, a gentlemanly man moved over and sat opposite me. He looked at my simple clothes and luggage and said in a slightly disdainful tone:</p>
<p>—Oh, where are you going? (The pure</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Beijing dialect is pleasant to hear, but his manner was really unbearable: his head waggling as he asked me.)</p>
<p>—Me? Going to Shanghai!</p>
<p>—Where are you from?</p>
<p>Beijing!</p>
<p>—Oh, Beijing! (He paused) Beijing is a good place!</p>
<p>Then his attitude changed, perhaps because he realized that I could also speak Beijing dialect.</p>
<p>—Beijing, ah, it really is a good place. I'm also from there, going to Shanghai... Have you been to Shanghai?... No? That place is really annoying. The most annoying thing is the toilets! Look at Beijing, it's so comfortable to live in. Not to mention anything else, places like Beihai Park, Zhongnanhai, and Shichahai are all fun. In Shanghai, staying one more day is like losing ten years of life!... Alas, it's so dirty!</p>
<p>As he spoke, it seemed as if everything in front of him and around him was dirty. He wiped his nose with a silk handkerchief and said a lot more. What he emphasized most was that "it doesn't matter for rich people," as if to say, "A poor wretch like you has to smell the toilet smell!" In order to maintain my own solemn attitude, I simply replied to him a couple of times, and then he ran off to another place. I heard him still talking about things in Beijing.</p>
<p>His words did not make me disgusted with Jiangnan: I still loved Jiangnan. The reason was that I hated the gray North Country, the weather that was filled with gray sand all day long, and the severe cold and scorching heat. But Jiangnan had not yet arrived. Perhaps Jiangnan was still far away.</p>
<p>But I finally got to see the wilderness of Jiangnan.</p>
<p>First, when we were about to arrive in Pukou, I was very skeptical about where these fields were: all of them were bare red earth. Not a single blade of green grass. At that time, I thought: this is Jiangbei, let's go past Nanjing and see again, maybe it will be better.</p>
<p>After passing Nanjing, the scenes of drought changed one after another. Some were endless stretches of red. Although some places had grass, it was dry, yellow grass. After passing several rivers, they were all dry, peeling, and lying there.</p>
<p>Where was the green grassland, the lovely Jiangnan!</p>
<p>Drought and water diverted had covered up this green grassland.</p>
<p>The poet's deceptive words had strengthened my hopeful belief, and the iron reality shattered this dream of longing. My heart was carried by the train to another place.</p>

<p>To the Nightingale</p>
<p>Nightingale, your song is so graceful and light; Nightingale, your song is so clear and moving; Ah! Poets are intoxicated by you, Ah! Lovers embrace in carefree joy! But please bow your head and look at these sinners in hell, in deep darkness and pain! Unwarm clothes, Unfilled stomachs, Who knows about the misery of their lives? Who knows? Nightingale! Please, for them, send out some roars of forced resistance, Encourage those despondent and suicidal, wandering on the wrong path; Cut through thorns and briars, and move forward hand in hand! Nightingale, your song must be tragic and powerful, a summons, invigorating! Nightingale, your song must be so solemn and moving! Ah—please don't just praise the gurgling spring in the secluded valley: Please don't, just sing the bright moon in the sky!</p>

<p>Miss Jiang Lingdi, an amateur piano virtuoso, hasn't even been on the radio yet, but yesterday the newspapers were already praising her, even writing about her age, origin, and temperament. The only things missing are Miss Jiang's zodiac sign, birth time, address, number of lovers, number of umbrella hooks, and number of supporters. In your spare time, please, Mr. Great Reporter who wrote this news yesterday, add these details to broaden our horizons and have a laugh!</p>
<p>The Xinmin News Agency wrote a piece titled "Yan Fei, Ye Ying, and Ye Hong Go to Taiwan...Incorrect." Meng Ying wrote a piece titled "Fat Sister Goes to Taiwan with Yan Fei, Ye Ying, and Ye Hong." The former and latter pieces were published on the same day yesterday, which is quite confusing. I don't know which piece is true? However, as far as I know, the Xinmin News Agency is writing nonsense without basis, while Meng Ying plagiarized the "Radio Waves" of the 4th, only reversing the order. Do the two of you think that's right? Does the editor think I'm wrong? (Silver Rain) The editor was inattentive, so both news items were published. It's hard to tell which is true or false for the time being. In the future, I hope readers will point out errors when they find them, but "tofu" is rejected (Editor).</p>
<p>The matter of eating tofu can be found everywhere. Soft Feet and Copper Thunder are having a battle of pens (details not included), while Iron Pen is saying from the side that Soft Feet is a poor scholar who writes solid articles, and Copper Thunder is the young master of No. 48 Penglai Road (note that No. 48 is a toilet). This tofu is indeed eaten well, no wonder Copper Thunder said: "Please, Iron Pen and his younger brother, come to visit. I will 'respectfully' await you." Returning a "respectful" character, so to speak, a punch comes, a kick goes. I wonder what the tofu flavor of "respectful" is like. Iron Pen? (Silver Rain)</p>
<p>I myself feel too "naive" to have become a patron of the "tofu shop" during the back and forth blows. Running the radio station can also add business cards (yesterday Mr. Copper Thunder's manuscript was not seen by the reporters of the Rose Troupe broadcast in Shen, Xin, and Current Affairs, really because the working hours are tight, and they do not have the "blessing of those tofu masters! But I still have to act as the Inspector of Penglai Road, this only asks the masters" to take the trouble (Editor).</p>
<p>I saw the news published in your newspaper on the 16th, about Green Silk, I don't know which brother it is, I have long admired your name.</p>
<p>Everyone calls Ni Yi of the Junren a radio runner, but now he is sitting at home.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Introduction to "The Moon Bends" <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>The season has reached late autumn, and the October wind brings a sad autumn mood to those who are disappointed. On bright moonlit nights, we may hear this folk song, faintly transmitted from the mouth of a resentful woman in the deep Min region.</p>
<p>The moon bends, shining on the nine continents, some families are happy, some families are worried!</p>
<p>Some couples share the same bed, some are wandering outside.</p>
<p>This is a popular and well-known folk poem, depicting the men and women of the world, who are forced to travel and are oppressed by the environment, causing them to drift east and fear the west, each drinking the bitter wine of separation. On the same night of reunion, some couples follow each other, enjoying human bliss to the fullest, while others think of their hometowns while gazing at the moon and miss their loved ones in the wind, which is extremely miserable. "The Moon Bends" is a five-act drama that Mr. Xu Zhuodai adapted based on the folk song as the main thread, weaving the joys and sorrows of life into a touching and poignant story.</p>
<p>"The Moon Bends" is led by Ms. Hu Die, with the entire cast of male and female actors from the Mingxing Company participating. After more than two months of rehearsal, it is completely proficient. It will be released at the Xinguang Grand Theater in the near future. This is the unprecedented large-scale drama movement of the Mingxing Company, and this once-in-a-lifetime grand event is of course the most sensational event recently.</p>
<p>The outline of the plot of "The Moon Bends" is as follows:</p>
<p>The opening of the prologue of "The Moon Bends" is set in a certain city four or five years ago, on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. In a happy family, a young couple is entertaining guests and enjoying themselves under the moon, but a flash flood suddenly erupts, and this gathering is immediately filled with an atmosphere of terror.</p>
<p>Because of the flash flood, a huge flood was brewed, and for a time, cries of mourning were heard everywhere, and refugees were on the road. The people were all in a panic, like stray dogs. Among them, the young couple, Tao Zifang and his wife Manzhu, and their daughter Xue'er, were also separated, and their whereabouts were unknown to each other.</p>
<p>After Manzhu was separated from her husband by the flood, she had to take her daughter and live through miserable years under difficult living conditions. Manzhu, because she missed her husband and the vows between husband and wife, had been living her miserable and impoverished life for four or five years. She has experienced vicissitudes of life, but she always foolishly hopes that her husband will return safely. Many people advised her to remarry, but she refused. Jin Huanzhang, a childhood classmate who helped her the most, loved her deeply, but she also politely refused him. However, that man also rejected the love of many women for her. She only has one unwavering wish: that her husband can return gracefully and relive the sweet years.</p>
<p>This is the last scene: Cao Zhu has experienced hardship and finally met her husband by chance while working as a servant. However, everything has changed. Zifang has become the husband of a noble lady. When they met, he was like a stranger, pretending not to recognize her, and unintentionally, he killed Manzhu's, and also his own daughter Xue'er. Manzhu was extremely sad, but at the same time, she woke up from a dream, knowing that a woman's reliance on her husband is just a dream, because men are often unreliable. Although the tragedy was revealed on the spot, the noble lady blamed Zifang for a while, and because of sympathy, she was willing to let her live together. But in the end, she resolutely left her husband. The tragedy of life on the stage ended in a tragic atmosphere.</p>
<p>"The Moon Bends" has such a touching plot, rich in dramatic life performances, joys and sorrows, and touching poignancy, which naturally can stir the emotions of the audience everywhere. In addition, the great scenery on the stage, such as flash floods, floods, etc., is probably an unprecedented initiative on the stage of our country?</p>
<p>The actors of "The Moon Bends" are: Ms. Hu Die plays Manzhu, Wang Xianzai plays Tao Zifang, who abandons the old and embraces the new and indulges in pleasure, Gao Zhanfei plays Manzhu's childhood classmate Jin Huanzhang, Gu Lanjun plays Huanzhang's cousin, who writes "love" as "change", Yan Yuexian plays a socialite, Zhu Qiuhen plays the noble lady Yingyu, Shu Xiuwen plays Mother Chen, etc. All of them are the best talents in the film industry, so their every move, every frown and smile, are subtle and in harmony with the characters in the play. Their acting skills on the screen have long been widely praised, but this time, their large-scale performance on the stage of film actors has also reached the pinnacle of their superior stage artistic performance.</p>
<p>Readers who love drama, wait and see!</p>
