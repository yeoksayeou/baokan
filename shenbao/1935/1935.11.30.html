<h3 id="c18">黃蘇借欵談判不成 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>日前倫敦電訊。盛傳英蘇兩國進行商業借欽談判。英國擬以欽項貸予蘇聯。供蘇聯購買英國貨物如鐵道材料之用。並謂或將在借欽金額內提出若干作爲償還帝俄時代欠英舊債之一部分云云。惟頃據塔斯社消息。此項談判並未進行。蘇聯當局並聲稱。革命前借欽與目前借欽問題。絕然無關。蘇聯决不容其相提並論。</p>
<p>按年來英蘇關係時緊時弛。政治制度之對立爲兩國不能眞實交好之根因。蘇聯之援助殖民地叛離宗主國。英國之佈置反蘇陣綫。以及舊債償還問題等等。固使雙方關係常趨隔離狀態。但吾人不能認爲兩國將絕對無可協調。彼等互利之處固亦甚多。舉其顯著者。英國正熱望蘇聯之龐大市塲。而蘇聯亦極願接受外來資力之臂助也。且就國際現狀言。最近遠東及歐非局勢緊張。亦頗有稍稍解消兩國對立程度之可能。今次倫敦方面盛傳借欵談判。雖未實現。要可想見英國方面已有此種意向。蓋據吾人觀察。此次英國需求於蘇聯者。似較蘇聯之需求於英國者爲切。試申述之。</p>
<p>其一近年英國在外市塲日趨萎縮。殖民地上被日美等商品與資本之侵入者頗爲深邃。而目前在華市塲又以日本勢力之猛進。使固有之優越地位動搖。加拿大投美形勢益形顯明。日前美加新訂商約。多數英人咸認加拿大之隸屬英國必有失其意義之一日。抑且憂懼渥大瓦帝國貿易恊定之破裂。凡此。皆足以證明英國商品與資本出路之苦悶。蘇聯地域廣大購買力豐富。固一絕好之市塲也。</p>
<p>其二。國聯對意制裁實施。歐非局勢頗形危急。（最近又有埃及要求完全獨立運動之爆發）日本深入中國。太平洋風雲險惡。基於此等極形緊張之國際形勢。英國在遠東及近東方面。在在需一强力者爲之聲援。而蘇聯雄據歐亞適。又爲英國之良好對象也。</p>
<p>至於蘇聯。爲貫澈其和平政策。以利於完成國內建設起見。自亦樂於與英維持較善關係。且建設上亦頗有需求利用國外之資力。故向英借欽購貨。當亦爲蘇聯所期待。</p>
<p>雖然希望爲一事。事實之能否成就則又爲一事。目前英蘇兩國關係。固具有上述互利條件。但若謂借欽之必將成立。國交之必將親密。則又非盡然。此次談判前途。大致至少尙有如下之數種困難點。須加以克服。</p>
<p>一·政治上對立問題如英國不停止反赤主角之任務。或蘇聯不放棄援助殖民地革命。兩國關係將無從好轉。</p>
<p>二·舊價問題如蘇聯表示不願償還帝俄時代之舊債。則英國國內必將反對再起新債。可使談判受相當頓挫。</p>
<p>三·貿易問題聞英蘇兩國俱表示希望擴充出口貿易。是則在談判商約時。或將產生對立狀態。</p>
<p>總之。吾人認定英蘇談判决非簡捷之事。縱使兩國在日後能成就或種恊定。恐亦非依循曲綫進行不可也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）據官方宣稱、日昨法國總理賴伐爾與英國大使克拉克所作談話、「十分滿意」、殆可認爲恢復阿比西尼亞和平之一條捷徑、至於英國外部阿比西尼亞問題專家潘德遜仍在巴黎與法國外部東菲司長桑岡旦進行談話、外部頃已接得潘德遜之報吿、但以爲在談話繼續進展之前、外部必先將此項報吿、加以縝密研究而後可云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>庇斐利斯通訊，塔期社的通訊員訪問斯丹林的母親伊卡台林娜，寫了下面一段說話：</p>
<p>我們跑進一個小而安樂的公腐，那裏有許多光綫充足設備簡單的房間。第一件跑進我們眼簾來的東西，就是一個巨大的列寗照相。圓桌子上有個瓶兒裝滿了鮮花，此外就是幾份最近的報紙，桌子前面一張沙發上，坐着斯丹林的母親，她很樸素地在頭上披着一件黑色的披肩。她戴一副角邊的眼鏡：我們進去時候正在那裏看報。我們握着她的老而瘦的手；當我們講到她的兒子時候，她的眼睛裏面充滿着快樂，表示着她的溫柔和滿足·他說：</p>
<p>「我同索索會見…我已經好久沒有見過他了。我的身體不大好，常常感到軟弱：但是看見他的時候，我是快樂極了，好像我已經長了一對翅膀一樣。我的軟弱和疾病不知道到那裏去了。</p>
<p>「我們的拉佛倫底，（聯邦共產黨地方委員會秘書）來說，索索已經來了，他已經到了這裏，隨時可以進來。</p>
<p>「門開了，他已踏進門檻，這是我自己的兒子啊。我看着，不大相信我的老眼。他也很快樂；他跑來同我接吻。他像很好，歡喜，快樂，溫柔地問着我的身體，問着親戚和朋友。</p>
<p>「突然我看到了兒子頭上的銀絲，我說：「這是什麽呢？兒子！難道你的頭髮也灰白了嗎」？他回答我說：「別去管它，母親！頭髮灰白是不要緊的。我覺得非常好。你不要擔憂我的頭髮。」</p>
<p>「我還問着我的孫子孫女。我歡喜他們，比世界上的什麽都喜歡！我的斯威脫拉娜，耶夏，梵索。索索戲笑着說，事情是這樣，他是斯威脫拉娜叫他來的，來問祖母要些梅醬。索索也歡喜這梅醬；似從小就是這樣的。</p>
<p>「時間過得很快。我們都已老了，朋友，親戚。他說了許多俏皮話；我們笑着。我們一同坐了好多時侯；我是非常快樂，因爲我有索索陪着。</p>
<p>「後來，紫索去看他的朋友，我獨自留在家裏。我想起了從前的事情。我除索索以外還有兩個兒子，但是他們很早就死了，只留了他一個。我想着我怎樣想敎我的兒子，怎樣把他送到髙里（高加索的一個小城）的學校裏去。他是一個好學生。但是他的父親，我的已故的丈夫維沙里昻决意把他領出學校，敎他自己的本行！做鞋匠。</p>
<p>「我盡我的力量來反對，甚至於同我的丈夫吵嘴；然而沒有辦法，還是照他的話做了。</p>
<p>「可是過了不多時候，我又得到勝利，把索索送到學校裏去。他被學校當做一個最好的學生，每日得到三盧布的津貼」。</p>
<p>我們靜靜地緊緊地聽着這位老太太的慢呑吞的說話。她吿訴我們她同她的兒子在髙里城的生活：爲着生活起見，她自己不得不做着各種苦工。她講她的兒子在童年時候怎樣讀書，怎樣敎導人家，在他還是一個小孩子的時候，他就敎着許多隣近的兒童讀書寫字。</p>
<p>她又講到其他時候，講到斯丹林開始做革命工作的時候。她講到她所過的悲苦日子：那時候她的兒子正在西伯利亞充軍。</p>
<p>我們同她看着斯丹林小時候的照片，這是他進高等學校時候的家族合影。我們看着她的牆角，那裏掛着幾幅斯丹林的最好的照片；就在她的床上。有一幅照片上面，有斯丹林用喬治亞文寫的親筆簽字。</p>
<p>伊卡台林娜太太繼續着說：「索索不久就同他的朋友散步回來。我們又談了許多時候。我用各種最好的東西來欽待他；而且沒有忘掉給他一瓶梅醬，帶給斯威脫萊娜。</p>
<p>「可是日子很短；分別的時侯到得太快了。索索跑上來，很溫和地同我接吻。舍不得同他分別，眼淚跑到我的眼睛中間來了；但是我抑制着自己。我不願意使我的兒子知道，我是怎樣舍不得他。因爲我很淸楚，他是忙着，要做許多重要工作」。</p>
<p>我們的訪問就這樣終結。我們向她吿別，感謝着她、親熱的招待，而且深深地威動着，離開了她！那曾把偉大領袖送給世界的老婦人的房間。（塔斯社）</p>

<h3 id="c48">江寗秣陵的農村人口和農村土地 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 喬啟明　蔣傑</p>
<p>（一）前言　民國二十四年夏，金陵大學農學院和農專科同學五七人，由作者等率領，進行江寗縣治秣陵鎭附近鄉村社會調査。按秣陵鎭坐落在首都東南，離京二五·六一公里，現有京建汽中貫通其間，交通極爲便利，鎮上市容亦頗整齊。按照江寗縣地方自治制度，全鎭及鄰近附庸，劃分爲二二里。鎭外有孝陵·仁陵·信陵·愛陵等四鄕，合共九六個村莊。此次在當地調査兩週，完成農村概况，家庭概况，農民生活，家庭析產，黨屬關係，和合作社社員調査等六種表格。本文來源，即係農村概况中的一部分材料，包括秣陵鎭範圍內的一一里，及四鄕七八個村莊。除鎭上九里，屬於非農業方面，並未調査，和另兩里材料不全，未加入統計外：四鄕村莊本屬全部塡報，奈因表格中若干事項，詢問民國元年的事實時，鄉民模糊不淸，無由置答，爲求材料正確起見，自當寗缺毋濫，不予統計。</p>
<p>（二）人口和土地的關聯人口是組成社會的因子，土地是生活資料的來源，所以整個社會的基礎，是建築在人口和土地上的。惟土地的仲縮性較小，而人口的消長，是隨時隨地變遷着的。要是人口傾向在增進，而可耕的土地面積依然，勢必引起人民生活的艱難；繼而發生種種嚴重的社會問題。例如：戰爭，疫病，犯罪等等均是。結果社會文化落後，國家即無由進步。</p>
<p>最近數十年來，中國的人口和土地問題，巳引起各界非常的重視。可是議論紛紛，莫衷一是。在人口方面，常把數量的是否過剩，成爲辯論的中心。在土地方面，雖有同一的「農塲太小」之理解，惟改進方案，却有側重利用與分配之爭。現加以綜合的歸納，可知中國今日人口和土地的失調，已成爲不可諱言的事實。本文目的，即在將調査所得，供給硏究這項問題者的一些助力。</p>
<p>（三）二十三年來的農戶變遷　在這項調査中，爲何抬人口口用農戶？緣年代相隔較久，回憶戶數不但較口數省事，且富有正確性；同時每戶的人口消長，究屬有限，决不致有大量的差異，是以採用農戶作單位爲佳。調査時，每村選擇三至六位年長者爲代表，詢問他們村上民國元年和民國二十三年的農戶比較。而於淸朝和民國的交替，給予農民的印象較深，回憶時即有所把握。據我們的統計；民國二十三年各鎭鄉間每個村莊的平均戶數，自最少的仁陵鄉之三五·四戶，至最多的信陵鄕之五四·二戶，各村總平均有四四·八戶。按當地秣凌鎭·仁陵鄕及孝陵鄕一部，水田較多，緣有秦淮河可供灌溉，土地利用已至極精約程度，人口亦且達到飽和點，因之每個村莊平均戶數自少。信陵鄉和愛陵鄕分據秣陵鎮西北兩方，地勢起伏，旱地居多。孝陵鄕的大部，亦有同樣情形。鄉中還有墾殖的可能，農人雖每年所獲甚至不能償付自己的工價，但爲餬口求生計，亦未嘗不是一種辦法，所以農戶便會逐漸增加。惟據北平地質調査所土壤專家蕭査理及地質專家校勃云：「江寗一帶荒山，均不宜農用，只能專作林地，否則不但無利可圖，反且冲刷過甚，貽害將至無窮。」是則該地未來的農田墾殖，實難樂觀。若拿現在和民國元年的戶數比較，全體村莊計多一二九一戶，每個村莊達一四·五戶。若用民元的共計計數爲基數，求出二十三年來農戶增加指數，可知孝陵，愛陵，信陵等三鄕增加最多，仁陵鄕最少。若將一鎭四鄕總平均，可知二十三年來的農戶數，幾較原數超過二分之一。</p>
<p>（四）二十三年來的土地變遷　我們以民元兀耕地總面積和民二十三年比較，除秣陵鎭外，各鄕都是增加的。秣陵鎭是四鄕的核心，負溝通城鄕經濟文化等種種使命，近年來鎭之附近建築加多，築路被侵等土地亦復不少；同時該鎭土地利用旣極精約，自無開墾新地的希望，則非農業用的土地多加一畝，即耕地面積少去一畝，至於各鄕增加的指數，正和前列農戶的變遷成正比，即以孝唆鄕的數量最髙，而仁陵鄉最低。一鎭四鄕總平均結果，廿三年來的耕地總面積，適較原數增加八分之一。（未完）</p>

<p>主席兪佐廷致歡迎詞云、廣東省政府主席林公、頃以屆全國代表大會竣事、任、道經滬上、小作勾留、本市工商界得以仰瞻豐采、是一極不易得之機會、廣州與上海、同爲吾國最先開闢之商埠、而粤省近年新工業勃興、與滬市加增其密接關係、使彼此有無相通、商業上得以截長補短、尤爲滬粤商業新發展之形勢、足以引起注意、敝會所以代表全市工商業乘此時機、略具杯酒、邀請蒞止、旣以抒其平昔企慕之忱、亦使彼此有傾談機會、幸蒙惠臨、不勝欣幸、年來中央政府銳意建設、粤省爲最努力實行之一省、就其年來爲滬人所共知都而論、如製糖一項、其出品除粵省自給之外、尙有鉅量行銷滬市、足以堵塞若干漏　、此爲振興國產呼聲中至可慶幸之事、語云、輔車相依、一國之中、猶如一家、貴於互相維護、例如粤省糖廠出品假使止以本省為銷路、而不於各省市設法推銷、其發展當有限度、又如種蔗貸欽、滬市金融界亦深明此舉於振興國產、有莫大關係、而竭誠接受、滬市工商界鑒於上述兩事、因此今日有一共同感想、即爲「從生產方面論、可就各省之需要與特長、以一省爲單位、從行銷方面論、從捐稅方面論、應以整個之版圖、爲經濟單位、不宜割分畛域、以「省爲單位、」吾國向來所設之轉口關稅、此省土貨運往彼省、海關須收轉口稅、此爲最妨得國產之發展、亦不符各國關稅之制度、是以中央已毅然於將來之最近期間、予以裁撤、此事財政部已屢有表示、而數年前由國府明令、實施廢除各省厘金、亦爲貫澈此項政策起見、今日省與省之間、不應再收貨物稅、其義至明、粤省前數年對於省外貨物、有議收保護稅之舉、經滬市工商界竭誠請求、蒙免征、足證敝會上述之貢獻、已爲粵省各當道及明公所諒解、此於今日杯酒晤叙之時、欲深致其感謝之忱者也、年來滬市工商業、一落千丈、其原因由於自東北四省淪陷之後、華北亦迭經波動、是以兩處銷路、則全然朴絕、一則非常銳减、致成爲今日不可療治之痼疾、故今日國內市塲、已侷促於艮江流域及珠江流域一帶、而珠江流域、以農產產品雜項專稅、及省外改革製品專稅、相繼施行、迭經籲請而未蒙免征之故、亦困於行銷不易、有折閱賠本之虞、今日滬商處此四面楚歌之會、期望於明公之大力斡旋者甚鉅、仰　棨戟、不啻德星、是以願乘此會、致其欵欽之愚忱、芻蕘之獻、倘蒙採納、何幸如之、</p>
<p>林氏答詞</p>
<p>廣東省主席林雲陔答詞、略云、此次經過上海、蒙貴會熱烈招待、很不敢當、並承貴會會員誠意帮助、甚爲感激、上海爲我國第一通商口岸、全國商業之重心、幾年來受不影氣影響、以致不及從前、但祇要人民與政府同心合力、則復興繁榮、均有希望、我國地大人衆、物產豐富、應將鐵路公路水利設法發展、使交通便利、鄕村之農產品與都市工業品、互相交換、如工業之原料用品、以前均賴外國輸入、此後應利用我國農產原料、仿照外國貨品、來發展工業、同時農業工業礦業、互相扶持、努力去幹、並發展我國地方銷路、日後勢必有很大收效、今雖在此不景氣時期、毋用灰心、繼續努力發展、恭祝各位成功、</p>
<p>劉氏演說</p>
<p>廣州市長劉紀文演說、略云、上海面上之商業重心、上海市商業之處俱全、爲全國之冠、廣東商會則不完備、以致與各處沒有聯絡、以後各地商會、應互相聯絡、例如日本在中國市塲各地、如上海·漢口·宜昌·廣東·等商業聯絡、銷貨有統計、如乙地缺貨物、則電甲地供給、調劑有方、奪了我們的市塲、我國內沒有組織、失了聯絡性、以致失敗、故應一致聯絡統計、才有辦法、廣東方面、有鑒及此、歡迎上海商業同人運貨至粤、粤運貨至滬、切實聯絡大家推銷、使已爲外人奪去之市塲、努力奪回云云、至十時許始盡歡而散、</p>

<p>道契註冊手續流弊</p>
<p>就以最普通之道契而論、亦不免流弊、所謂道契者、即以外人名義、在領事館註冊之承租地契、據此種地之註冊業主、雖爲外人、然大多數係以委托人之地位、代原業主執業、而原業主遂由註冊業主、授以道契及信托狀、此種制度、實中國之別開生面、爲別處所無、於楚在地產轉移中、嘗有註冊業主、借故換領新契、交給另一新業主、而不爲原業主所發覺者、到爭議發生時、法院往往判地產爲原業主所有、新業主爲便犯地權之人、</p>
<p>黠者利用常爲代押</p>
<p>除此之外、尙有註冊業主、往往因不知原業主之地址、無從通訊、而至代其担負各種捐稅者、故註冊業主與原業主之關係、實屬不滿、此外尙有註冊業主、對於原業主之憑據存底、紀載不全、嘗有原業主祗蓋一印章、便算存據、而不於蓋印外、再行簽字、若遇不識字之人、亦不加印指模、以爲憑證、因此種種不充份之紀載、與及社會一般人對於地產上法律之手續與習慣、不大明瞭、於是黠者遂常用不合法方法、取得合法業主之地契、委托證書、甚至印章等件、而實行抵押、至善意之貸欽人、不知根由、其放欽受押、以爲合法、殊不知所放之欵、係放與盜契之人、法律上實毫無保障也、</p>
<p>保障權利惟有登記</p>
<p>綜上各種土地複雜問題及其缺點、因以知土地抵押、非經土地局登記、不能予抵押權人及抵押人以合法保障、蓋當土地登記時、土地局對於地契與物權、加以愼密之考慮、苟地契旣准登記、即可證明業主、即為合法業主、而貸欵人於抵押放欵時、亦知與交易者爲合法業主、奸黠者雖欲敲剝、亦覺技窮、故抵押登記、實所以保障人民權利爲所必需之一種手續也、</p>
<p>公平處理法院是賴</p>
<p>至於抵押人及抵押權人雙方稱益之公平保障、則地方法院當爲處置此種訴訟之機關、關於此點、有一世界著名之理財家、亦曾表異議、已述意見、謂「如可在法院執行上訴、則建議頒行、不無障碍」、但以上海市土地所具之特殊情形而論、實難有充分理由、逕行將法院上訴裁撤、然苟能實行登記辦法、則現在各種缺憾與弊端、自能消滅、而上訴案件、雖不能完全免除、亦當可减少、依據土地法、在土地裁判所未成立以前、地方法院祗暫行處理關於不能以登記辦法、用行政權淸理之抵押特別案件、</p>
<p>拍賣條規限制引用</p>
<p>至於規定抵押權人備具担保、方可公行拍賣之條規、亦不過用於當如上列之爭執案件發生時、以保障合法業主之權利、但實際上非經土地局長認定抵押權人、有實足法律上之證據、可以勝訴時、不輕引用、</p>
<p>托崙制度實可採取</p>
<p>土地制度設完備者、當推托崙氏制度、Torrens　System日然即使在此制度內、對於仰賴法院之保障、以執行抵押權、亦不能避免、照美國現行之托崙氏制度、舉凡各種轉移、如抵押租賃等、均須載入土地證書內、各契據受政府保證、逢有地產轉移、須經政府指定人簽證、至於抵押產業、多由抵押權人交律師備辦、再由抵押人當公證人前、簽認履行抵押權人所擬各條件、倘遇抵押人不履行時、則抵押權人即行採取合法手續、執行抵押權、並可聲請土地法院執行之、至法律規定之期限滿後、普通大約三十天、便即行拍賣、此種簡易制度、實有可取之點、堪充改革土地制度之參考、</p>
<p>歡迎各界規劃建議</p>
<p>本市土地制度情形、須從各方面研究、其根本改革、非經各有關係團體、如地產公會、不動產公司、領館註冊部、新聞界、法律界、銀行界、與各專家、共同恊助研究規劃不爲功、凡有建議於解决土地問題有關者、均表歡迎、尙望社會匡其不逮、有厚望焉、</p>

<p>— 謝壽康</p>
<p>一、</p>
<p>比利時駐中國公使紀佑穆男爵，對於中比間文化事業之發展，極其重視，去年在上海曾主辦比國現代繪畫展覽會，現叉在京滬先後主辦同樣之展覽會，今年規模擴大，徵集出品，有一百三十餘件，在京備受歡迎。現在滬假Hamiltou　House，從今日起公開展覽一星期，紀公使溝通中西文化，其熱心及努力，殊足稱頌。</p>
<p>二、</p>
<p>比國繪畫，不特現在蓬蓬勃勃，光鋩四出，過去之比國畫派，即佛夾門畫派、FlemishSchool，有極燦爛之歷史，特於介紹此次畫展之前，略述其梗概，以溯淵源。</p>
<p>比利時在歐洲繪畫史上之地位，極其重要；蓋歐洲繪畫，自應用油質調色以後，始大發達，而應用油質調色之集大成者，即爲比國崗城人樊逸克兄弟Freres　Van　Eyck。同時樊氏兄弟，復將解剖及透視等科學，灌入繪畫，面與偉登Weyden，博慈Bouts，梅麥靈克Memlins，溝思Goce諸畫聖，創立佛來門畫派，即古代比國畫派，時在西歷十五世紀也。</p>
<p>樊氏兄弟合作之大傑，作爲一神龕，叉名多摺祭臺Polyplique。是項神龕，由二十木板構成。木板表面，繪有圖畫，兩旁有活動板兩扇，前後面亦均有繪畫。神龕中心結構之主題，爲拜禱神羊Acoration　de　L'AgneauMystique，及生命之源泉Fontainede　la　Vie。上層有畫板七，勝利之耶穌居其中，兩旁爲聖母及聖約翰；再兩旁有奏樂之天神。天神之外，右有亞當，左有愛娃。下層畫板，則繪有耶穌之護衛隊，正直之審判官，隱者農民等等。</p>
<p>「神龕」中人物之面部手臂衣褶，以及背景之草木花菓，均肖妙精微，天衣無縫。神龕完成於西歷一四三二年五月六日，當即陳列於崗城之聖約翰敎堂，即現在之聖巴翁敎堂。至十九世紀初葉，神龕巳不完整，其中數畫板，爲柏林美術館購藏。至一九一九年，方由凡爾賽和約規定，交還比國。</p>
<p>你登作品，在當時極風行，長於宗敎畫。聖母，聖約翰，馬得來，及「送埋耶穌者」之痛苦，描寫之莊嚴，虔誠，深刻，空前絕後。博慈之傑作，爲羅文敎堂之神龕，其結構之主題。係「最後聖餐」。此外又有「三聯畫」兩幅，一爲聖逸拉麥之慘刑圖，一爲聖希博利得之四馬分屍圖。素描有個性，顏色呈光澤，係博氏之特長。梅麥靈克係偉登之弟子，其技巧準確而溫柔，所繪宗敎畫，無奪目之彩色，無驚人之情緒，祗求幽靜整肅，慈藹雍容。至比繪畫中，紗葛裏層之透影，人像面部隱約陰陽之推淮，幾不可思議。梅氏爲繪畫史中最大人像畫師之一，其作品之大部分，聚集於波如時之聖約翰醫院內。至於溝思，雖非偉登之學生，却大受其影響。蘇格蘭，斐冷翠，柏林，波如時，均藏有溝氏傑作。就中以在斐冷翠之「牧者拜禱一爲最偉大。結構雄壯，人像眞實，溝氏實十七世紀佛來門畫派之先導者。</p>
<p>與初期佛來門畫派，南北對峙，互相輝映者，爲文藝復興後之意大利各畫派。南畫爲理想派，以素描結構勝：長於史蹟，圖案，及裸體。北畫爲寫資派，以彩色，光綫構，長於人像，風景，與靜物。兩派固旨趣不同，技巧各異，要成績彪煥，啟導後人於無窮則一也。</p>
<p>嗣後佛來門畫派，代出宗師，綿延不巳，在十六世紀有巴底尼Patinir創造風景畫，包詩Bosch創造神魔畫，波耳格爾Brueghel則另樹一幟，以蕭索悲慘之情緒，描寫農民生活，及農村冬景，當時人稱其作品爲「怪畫」。至十九世紀平民主義昌明之後，波氏始爲世推崇，認爲農民畫師之先河。</p>
<p>波耳格爾之後，有呂本期Rubens面集佛來門畫派之大成。呂氏包羅萬象，舉凡人像，風景，動物，靜物，宗敎故事，愛情故事，縉紳階級及民間故事，無不惟肖惟妙，止於至善。當時畫師，及十八世紀英法畫師如希諾此Renolds耿士補賀Gainsborough及瓦多Watteau等，一致師事，受其影饗。至呂氏遺留作品之多，古今藝人，亦無能與比倫者。</p>
<p>同時博浩危Branwer，得尼益Terniers等，專攻小幅繪畫，在極小篇幅之中，作極精細極饒趣味而極有章法之繪畫，其成功與荷蘭小幅繪畫相伯仲，此亦佛來門畫派之另一特色也。</p>
<p>十八世紀爲佛來門畫派之衰微時期，其間名畫師固亦不少，特不能與前三世紀之宗師相提並論，迄十九世紀比國獨立以後，比國畫派迺勃然再興，沛然叉盛，依據歐洲時代潮流，努力前進，以恢復其在國際間固有之重要地位，自一八三〇年至一八六〇年，爲浪漫畫派鼎盛時期，最著名之畫師，爲拉蘭Lalaing月爾慈Wiertz等，作品多偏重於歷史及象徵畫。自一八六〇年至一八八〇年，爲寫實畫派鼎盛時代，最著名之畫師，有格魯Groux，斯帖玫Stevens，麥尼益Meunier等，其特長在描寫日常生活。一八八〇年爲印象畫派出發時期，印象派特別注重光綫及顏色，比人對此滴有遺傳之大賦，故其成功特大；如格羅士Glaus古爾登Courtens，福來特希克Frederic，白斯天Bastien，安索Ensor，斯米特Smith，希蘇爾Gilsoul，雷門士Laemans，阿得斯Wouters等，直與印象畫派策源地之法國大師相頡頑。</p>
<p>至歐戰後產生之未來，達達，立體，表現，新印象，新古典各畫派，比國亦應有盡有，前四派係一時之習尚，無成績之可述。後兩二派仍繼續努力，浪求光明，然近十餘年來，一般畫師，多不受派別之拘束，不遵現成之方式，各本個性，自由發展。比人富有藝術遺傳性，及顏色與形體之天賦，其繪術遺傳性，及顏色與形體之天賦，北繪畫因之精進，實未有艾也！</p>
<p>三·</p>
<p>現代比利時畫派，係古佛來門畫派之嫡系後裔，作風雖今古不同，但其民族性，未嘗不顯然存在也。此次比畫展出品，佳作甚多。佛來門書派之風格，即可見一斑。與展者及其作品分別介紹如後：</p>
<p>比國現代大師中，最崇仰吾國過去之優越文化：而與吾國人士最接近者，當首推白斯天先生A.Bastien。白氏係一出身窮困，刻苦努力而成功之畫師，曾任比京美術院院長。歐戰後，繪有伊塞大戰圖Panorama　de　L'yser，髙十五公尺，長一百五十公尺，此次出品有前比王亞爾培一世之像，（四八號）。以簡捷之筆法，畢露比王英毅不撓之氣槪。另有花菓一幅，筆法亦極簡老，設色復異常蒼麗。</p>
<p>希蘇爾Gilsoul亦現代大師之一，生於一八六七年，其「莊前」（六五號）結構幽靜，作法老練。「老屋」（六六號）亦同一作風，均饒有佛來門意味。</p>
<p>溪喜Richir與巴士Baes，均爲婦女像專家，極受一般貴婦歡迎。溪氏之女人像二幅（一〇八號一〇九號），及巴氏之幼女像二幅（九號十號），皆渲染精細，形態逼眞。其格調雖近館閣，但其工力實有不可及之處。</p>
<p>Opsomer係盎維斯美術院院長，在比畫壇頗享盛名。可惜此次出品中之設君像（一〇〇號）。或因成見，用色太黄，遠不及其平素作品之成功。第二幅出品「花」，設色雖蒼雅，但结構似嫌拘縮。</p>
<p>杜山Toussaint之花（一一九號），亞爾培J.Albert之「比京郊外」（八號），格來士Clesse之一漁人家眷」（二四號），格雷登Creytens之風景（三四號三五號），磨特烏Moitroux之女像（九六號九七號），多馬Thomas之花帽（一一八號），樊得雷Van　de　Leene之裸體及西班牙女人（一二〇號一二一號），均有老到之筆觸，及精雅之彩色，堪稱佳作。</p>
<p>至俾塞海Buisseret之凝思（一三號）及農婦（一四號），在極精確之素描上，加以靜雅之彩色，而衣褶則極其簡勁而有摩登氣味，此可視爲新古典派之代表作品。</p>
<p>以刀代筆者，有格羅林克Crommelinck及馬梭納Massonet，格氏之「農民」及「風雲」（三六號三七號），及馬氏之雜劇院樂師及西班牙人（九〇號九一號），均氣勢磅礴，意味深遠，頗有獨到之處。</p>
<p>拉底尼Latinis之敎堂街（八一號）及鄕村（八二號），古樸簡老，有令人不忘之力量。馬緒Masui則以純印象派之技巧，描寫海景（九三號）及靑野（九二號），極其成功。新派作家，當首推俾蕾Bnyle其作品（一五號一六號（之結構設色，均摩登化，另有一種風味。</p>
<p>總之，此次比畫展，由全部看來，可謂一在水準上之畫展。紀公使熱心溝通中西文化，比畫師踴躍與展，吾人除感謝而外，惟希望北能獲實際成功耳！</p>

<p>— 武育宣</p>
<p>工廠之第二部分，爲毛羢綫之染色塲所。係將成束後之毛羢綫，染成各種顏色，以便購買者之選擇。該廠之染色塲所，又可分爲染色與風乾兩大過程，在染色部分，有自動染色機四部，所謂自動染色機，係將染缸中之沸水，用帮浦使其循環不息，以避免羢綫在染色時，發生顏料膏水不勻之弊，此外另有人工染色機二具，以備不時之需。現在此四部自動染色機，巳能染出五十六種不同之顏色。毛絨綫經染色後，第二部工作，係將其送入熱風亁燥機內風乾，此機上面安置電風扇，下面裝設水汀，平時機內溫度常爲攝氏七十度，染色毛羢綫送入機內，二十分鐘內即可吹亁。</p>
<p>最後一部分則爲毛羢綫之檢查與包裝塲所，染色完畢後之毛羢綫，必須經過人工之檢查，視其有無缺點，若檢査後認爲完善，則由人工加貼商標，打成包裝，以為輸往中塲服資之準備。至此毛羢綫之製造工作，乃全部吿成。</p>
<p>該廠現有男女工人百餘人，其中以女工占大部分。廠方對工人之待遇，除按照工作能力給予工資外，並供給膳宿，以减少工人日當生活上之煩瑣，使其能安心作業、同時對於男女工人之管理及訓練，亦特加注意。因工人爲生產之一主要原素，工人之知識，技術與健康，對於生產能力之關係極爲密切，故該廠當於工人工作之餘，另再根據上述三項原則而施以特殊之訓練，現該廠之生產能力，每日能紡毛羢綫千八百磅，最髙時可達二千磅以上。其所製成之產品，分爲針織開斯米（即針織毛羢綫）與手織開斯米（手織毛羢綫）二種，品質均甚優美。針織開斯米，大都爲四十支與三十二支綫，手織開斯米，則以四股綫寫最多。針織手織二種開斯米之生產量，每日各約爲九百磅，其在山塲上銷售時所用之商標，爲外國皇后牌，蓋寓有擴充世界市塲之雄國也。</p>
<p>參觀旣畢，記者等均甚欣慰，惟個人覺尙有一項必須設法加以改進者，即原料之使用間題。該廠現在所使用之原料，係毛條而非原毛。此項毛條，大部分購自澳洲，間亦向英法等國採辦，惟國貨則尙未採用。據陳先生談，該廠採用外國毛條之理由，因我國海關對於毛條與原毛之進口，係課以同一之稅率。但在製造毛羢綫時，原毛所能製成之羢綫，僅祇及同量毛條所製羢綫之半數，爲咸經成本計，不得巳而購川毛絨爲原料，至於國產羊毛，因毛羢綫之品質關係，能適合於該廠使用者，僅山西省有年約六萬磅之生產量，而該廠每年所需羊毛，約有二百萬磅以上，供需求量甚遠。但在記者記之，我國北部盛產羊毛。每年出口數量頗巨，以去年論，我國毛類輸出爲二十五萬餘擔，値三千四百萬元以上，若該廠能將製造方法，研究改良，設法應用國產羊毛，則該廠之原料，將來可不致受外人之控制，其前途之發展，當更不可限量也。</p>

<h3 id="c145">星宿對於無綫電波之影響 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 决明</p>
<p>（一）星宿和電波的關係</p>
<p>稍微研究過無綫電的人，誰也知道無綫電波和太陽及月亮關係之密切，尤以太陽的黑點數，日蝕，月亮的位置等，對於無綫電波的影饗最大。</p>
<p>可是對於那麽許多的眞珠寳石似地滿佈着天空的星兒們，注意的人却比較的少。普通研究無綫電的人，或許以爲星兒過於渺小，故亦無足輕重，因之可以將其付諸等閑吧。可是這是很大的錯誤。我們如果一想到地球周圍的星宿那麽的多，當亦不難知道其對於電波影響之大。何况太陽和月亮，嚴格的說，本來也不過是星宿之一而已。</p>
<p>現在便宜上，將星兒分爲「流星」與「星羣」詳說於下：</p>
<p>（二）流星與電波的關係</p>
<p>蔚藍的晚上天空，舉首望着明月，或數着那些燦爛的星兒的時候，常常可看到一道星光之飛奔，好像星兒的搬家似的。這就是所謂「流星」。</p>
<p>在天文學上，流星與恒星，根本上沒有什麽直接的關係。流星，實因浮游漂泊於星宿間之鐵或石的碎片，爲地球引力之所牽引，跑進地球的大氣中，與空氣衝突摩擦而發出高度的熱與光的緣故。</p>
<p>流星的主要成分，據學者所分析，總不外：輕氣，養氣，淡氣，炭素，鎂，鈉，鐵，銅，鋁，鈣，錳，鎳，硅素，鉀，鈷等。此種物質，成爲細小粉末散佈空中，其大小約直徑十分之一或百分之一Micron（卽一百萬分之一公尺。）此種微細粉粒，久處於空中而不容易墜落；據日本長岡博士所研究，由流星發生的地方達到地球表面，約需三年之久。普通流星平均發生於離地球表面一一四·四籽之髙處，至七九·六籽而消失；然亦有達及地球表面的，不過爲數很少吧了。其墜落速度，每秒約四·四〇公尺。</p>
<p>此種流星所發生之「伊洪」（Icn），擴散於流星軌道周圍。此種「伊洪」之消失，因其擴散狀態，地球磁力的影饗，太陽光綫的光壓等，而各有出入，固不能一概言之，但就一般而論，似乎頗費時日；流星對於電波的影響，往往繼續存在將及數十天之久者，蓋卽因此。</p>
<p>那末這種流星的數，究竟有多少呢？據天文學家所言，以肉眼能看到者，每小時約有八個；然吾人眼中所能看到者，換言之卽我們的視界，實僅地球周圍的天空之一小部分而已，實際上地球全體人類肉眼所能看到的流星總數，每日約在二千萬個以上；若連肉眼所看不到而須用望遠鏡觀察才能知道者一並算入，則其數覓在四萬萬之多。由是觀之，流星對電波影響之大，實非無因。</p>
<p>不但如此，地球所進行的軌道中，有所謂「流星羣」者；此軌道之中，星流成羣而散在着，爲數至多：所以當地球走進這軌道時，星流對於電波的影饗自然也最爲激烈。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c146">超短波發射眞空管 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>304A號</p>
<p>無綫電學術的進步，促成無量數電台的增加，現在的週率範圍，已有不敷分配之勢，因此地廣人稀的超短波段遂得逐漸開發。爲對超短波作更進一步的研究起見，能產生較大電力的超短波發射眞空管，當然有極大的需要。</p>
<p>普通的發射眞空管，大約週率高至十五兆週時（二十公尺），尙能照常工作；但在三十兆週以上，則效率大减；週率再高時，甚至毫無輸出。據研究的結果，發射眞空管在極高週率時效力减弱的原故，大概是：一，使眞空管的極間電容量充電的電流，因週率加髙而增大，此電流經過管內的導綫，而產生極大的電力損失。二，週率加高則振盪週期（Pariod），與電子自陰極至屏極所須的時間相近，各部份的雷壓電流處於不適宜的相位，（如屏壓與屏流），而輸出跋小。三，在極髙週率時，配諧電路中的自感量及電容量甚小，因此平常可以忽略的眞空管內部自感量及電容量，此時亦產生極大的影饗。因此供產生超短波的眞空管，必須：管內的導綫加粗，屏極陰極間的距離相當的减小，內部自感量及電容量在可能範圍內，减至最小。美國西電公司的304A號（Westerne'ectric　304A）超短波發射眞空管，卽根據上列的改良點而設計製造。</p>
<p>304A的外形如附圖，其柵極及屏極均從玻璃管頂引出（因此引出綫减短，同時又可省去柵極或屏極的支持物，且玻璃在極高週率的絕緣能力，亦極優良），屏極爲石墨質（石墨的散熱能力較金屬質的爲髙，因此屏極面積减少，極間電容量亦同時减小）：屏極離陰極甚近，因此電子自陰極飛至屏極的時間，亦相當的减小。304A是振盪，擴大二用，在一百兆週時（三公尺），可照規定電力工作（屏壓一千二百五十弗打時，輸出約一百十瓦）；週率再高則輸出亦有相當减小，但在三百兆週（一公尺！）時，仍能有相當的輸出。</p>
<h3 id="c147">電工與電工率（續） <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 恩倫</p>
<p>圖中半圓內所標示的數量便等於兩個四分圓內所標示的數量相乘的積；一個四分圓內所標示的數量便等於半圓內所標示的數量除去另一個四分圓內所標示的數量的商。</p>
<p>由歐姆定律，電工率也可以電流和耗阻，或電壓和耗阻來表示。因爲V=IR</p>
<p>故P=VI=IRXI=I2R……（4）</p>
<p>因I=VR</p>
<p>故P=VI=VXVV2……（5）＝RR</p>
<p>電工率旣由電壓與電流相乘的積，故有電壓而無電流，或有電流而無電壓，其電工率皆等於零。上圖便示一發電機或電池的輸出電工率（Output　Power）和負荷耗阻（Load　resistance）改變的關係。電流表A及電壓表V爲量電工率輸出的接法。</p>
<p>（A）圖示輸出電路中斷，稱爲斷路（Opon　Circuit），其綫路耗阻爲無窮大，故電流表所量得的電流爲零；雖電壓表所量的電壓爲發電的電壓全値，但電工率爲輸出電流與輸出電壓的乘積，故輸出電工率亦等於零。（B）圖示輸出電路沒有耗阻，稱爲短路（Short　Circuit），故電流表所量電流極大；但因爲輸出電路的耗阻爲零，故電壓表所量的電壓爲零。因之，出電工率亦爲零；所有發電機的電工率全消耗於電機本身的內耗阻。（C）圖示尋常輸出電路，其電路耗阻爲R。設將R變動，電流電壓均隨之變動，故輸出電工率亦要改變。耗阻增加，電流便要减小，但需壓增大；反之，耗阻减小，電流便要增大，但電壓减小，當R恰等於電機的內耗阻時，電工率輸出爲最大。</p>
<p>電工爲電工率與時間相乘的積。設T表時間，W表電工，則W=VIF…………（6）</p>
<p>W=I2RF……（7）</p>
<p>或　W=V2FR……（8）</p>
<p>以秒計時間時，電工或電能的單位爲朱爾（Joule）；朱爾卽一秒鐘內I安培電流流經I歐姆的耗阻所消耗的電能，或一秒鐘內一安培電流一弗電壓所做的工，（6）（7），及（8）式中，如V爲弗，I有安培，R爲歐姆，T爲秒，則當W爲朱爾。是故</p>
<p>朱爾＝弗×安培×秒</p>
<p>瓦特＝朱爾秒</p>
<p>用時（Hour）計時間時，電工的單位爲瓦特（Watt-hour）；一瓦時即一瓦電工率與一小時相乘的積。電工的較大單位有甅時，瓩時等，普通電燈電表（俗稱火表）所量的電度，卽瓩時，一電度卽瓩時。（續完）</p>

<p>孫德謙先生之死，余適客扶桑，比返國，聞馬公愚敎授言，始知之，爲之欷歔者累日。先生號隘堪，吳縣人，於學無所不窺，尤精諸子，志行介潔，恬忽世榮，垂老執敎海上大學，頗艱窮，前月杪以胃疾卒，年六十有九。所著書有太史公書義法，漢書藝文志舉例，諸子通玫古書讀法略例等二十餘種，宏深精博，得未曾有，扶桑學者，嚮慕獨殷，在昭和攝政時代，曾由文部省大臣江木千之將其書進呈御覽，據彼邦人言，此種殊榮，卽本國人亦不易得。當時吳昌碩戲謂先生曰：我得銅像，僅出自書畫家友朋，不過小人下達，君則可稱君子上達矣。余曾閱彼邦文化刊物，稱章太炎爲大文學家，而稱先生爲大儒，實則先生之文，與李審言並稱。錢基博嘗言：現代工駢偶者，僅此兩家。王靜安則謂審言過於雕藻，先生氣韻疏朗，自當勝之。靜安不輕許人，而獨佩先生與張孟劬，嘗同訪沈寐叟。寐叟贈詩有三客一時萃吳會，百眾九部共然疑之句，需謂先生及干靜安張孟劬也。寐叟又嘗云：海上詩人多而文人少，文人多而學人少，君與王張，眞無愧爲學人矣。此皆余曩者追隨諸前輩之側，而得諸耳目者也。曾幾何時，寐叟返道山，靜安自沈沒，今先生又以病死聞，國學大師，凋謝殆盡，而國運亦益不堪問矣。嗚呼，余又何能無慟於中哉！（不受酬）</p>

<p>鴉月烟如慢性肺癆，傷生伐性，爲害至烈，乃嗜之者以其能興奮一時，遂不惜飲鴆止渴。今流毒遍海內，於民族前途，爲極大之障礙，政府爲挽救危亡計，嚴令厲禁，良有以也。</p>
<p>鴉片之名稱不一，曰烏香，或曰烏烟，就其本名曰鴉片，亦曰阿片，亦曰亞榮，亦曰阿芙蓉，亦曰合浦融。</p>
<p>中國原不產此物，係由域外輸入，惟自何時由何處輸來，漫無可稽，見諸史籍者，當以大明會典所紀各國貢物，謂暹羅爪哇等國貢物中，俱有鴉片列入，爲最先紀載，鴉片之輸入，或卽自此始</p>
<p>又明萬歷時李時珍所著本草綱目，穀部有云：鴉片前代罕聞，近方有用之者，又云：阿芙蓉是嬰粟花津液，其結苞時，午後以針刺外靑皮，勿損其裏皮，刺三五處，次早津出，以竹刀刮入磁器陰乾，爲藥用。</p>
<p>又方以智物理小識云：嬰粟津液，收入磁器，用紙封口，暴二七日用之，其方傳流如此，或以治泄痢，或用爲房中藥，性暖而濇，未爲大害，此皆用以爲藥，若裝槍呼吸，則未有是法也。</p>
<p>曾記某君有戲詠鴉片烟寳塔詩一首，極詼諧，詩云：唉，難挨，癮來哉，且把燈開，拏槍信口吹，吸一個興致來，那管田園盡成灰，一生享用命裏安排，你不吃亦不見得發財。此雖游戲筆墨，而描摹吸烟者之心理，可謂畢肖。</p>
<p>又有詠人吸烟詩云：一副枯骸登鬼錄，二行淸涕聳吟肩，及房門虛掩嗔人問，簾幕低處祗自知，均堪寫照者也。</p>

<p>他說着，又是向了志前微微的一笑，期待着他那具體的答復。志前想了一想，笑道：雖然有一個法子，我暫時不便宣佈。北海放下來的手，又不知不覺的，伸到頭上去搔了幾搔，問道：不便宣佈嗎？志前索興給他一個悶葫蘆去猜着，微笑着點了兩點頭。就在這個時候，得了一個轉園的機會，却聽到茶房，一連串的，在隔壁屋子裏低聲說話。他所報吿的，正是前面院子賈多才夫婦的事。志前這就瞅着板壁，微笑着望了北海，於是二人又聽了下去。却聽到那婦人答道：什麽？那姓賈的這樣欺負人嗎！他花多少錢，把人家的家庭買斷了？茶房答道：聽說是一百五十塊錢。那婦人道：一百五十塊錢就拆散人家的骨肉，這姓賈的太狠心。不過這出賈女兒的人家，也太沒有出息，不過是一百五十塊錢。茶房沒作聲，有一聲微笑，那局長慢聲慢氣的道：不過一百五十塊錢？那是小數目嗎？甘肅地方，爲了一塊五毛錢的事，賣兒賣女的也很多哩。那婦人發出很嚴厲的聲音道：有這樣便宜的人，怎麽不和我買兩個了頭？那局長答道：那是前兩年鬧災荒時候的事。婦人道：前年的事，你鬼扯什麽？局長默然了。那婦人道：茶房，你把那女人的娘家人，叫一個來，我有話和他說。茶房笑道：胡太太，你何必問他們的事。他們都是沒有知識的人，一句話不順頭，就要哭了起來的。那婦人道：人不傷心不流淚，不是受了委屈，人家會哭嗎？我不怕哭，你只管叫一個人來，我還有要緊的話問他呢。接着脚步響，那茶房是由窗子外面帶了笑容過去。（三六八）</p>

<p>— （楊子江）</p>
<p>在從膠州路穿到申園足球塲的一條衖裏，在美藝公司崇髙的牆壁上，我看到了四個很大的白粉字，日：「禁扯招貼」。當然，這是禁止招貼的誤寫，但是多麽足以令人興「失之毫厘，差以千里一之感呵！</p>
<p>中國文字構造的繁複，固是一個弊病。然「止」字與「扯」字的誤用終覺未免太離奇，試想，「禁扯招貼，」不是非惟不禁止招貼，幷且還給招貼者以一種保護嗎？</p>
<p>如果美藝公司的主人行經此處，我想他一定要莞爾而笑了。</p>

<h3 id="c177">美人菊 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>是去年菊花盛開的時候，我寄寓的宿舍裏，開始有一個姑娘來叫賣鮮花兒。每天，滿滿的一籃兒，不上半小時，總已賣完了，欣然的提着空籃兒回去。雖然主顧們都是年靑的餓狼也似的小夥兒，買花，是掛一個名兒，在實際上是買那姑娘的笑，但那姑娘却也並不吝給幾個沒有定價的笑靨，以推銷伊的鮮花。</p>
<p>據那姑娘說，姓黄，名兒就叫菊妹，十六歲，是蘇州城外的山塘上人。因爲父親死了，還有一個母親，和弟妹各一，所以爲衣食計，不得不出來博一些蠅頭微利。於是乎一位洋塲才子式的老余，便給題上了一個商標，叫做「美人菊」</p>
<p>美人菊，大致因加以「美人」的頭銜，所以挺沒有菊枝的那麽傲霜，時常的帶着輕微的咳嗽。隔上一個月，半個月，總得害上三二天的病。伊的臉上，雖然塗着厚厚的一層白粉，還搽上一些已不入時的紅胭脂，可是頸項裏，手背上，是深深地顯示着一層薑黄色。因此，我們的洋塲才子老余，又捏着鼻子，對伊咏着「可憐人比黄花瘦」。美人菊聽他這麼低咏時，總是把細細的腰肢一扭道，「胚，啥人要倷可憐嘘？眞正倒足仔霉哉」！緊跟着這麽幾句的，總是一大夥年靑人的一陣子歡愉的大笑。</p>
<p>從今年的七月間起，美人菊不上我們的宿舍來了，來替代伊的，是伊的母親，說的是女兒害着怯症，躺着不能出來了。但是老婆子連來了一星期，沒人過問，於是每天帶着美人菊的十二歲的妹妹來。雖然營業總是够不上美人菊，但多少倒還能銷去些兒。</p>
<p>昨天，一個悲哀的消息，由那老婆子帶來，而震動了全宿舍，說的是美人菊香消玉殞了。巧娜，正又是黄花凋謝的時節！</p>
<h3 id="c178">怪鴨蛋 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— （紀一介）</p>
<p>本埠康腦脫路瘋癲專門醫院的庖人，日前由小菜塲購得鴨蛋數枚，殼靑色，（俗呼靑殼鴨蛋）不料打開之際，忽發現怪蛋一枚，蛋殼及黄，均與常蛋無異，惟蛋白色紅如血，深以爲異。當報知院中職員，軍相驚奇。聞該院現將此蛋盛貯玻璃杯中，連同蛋殼，一併妥爲保存。亟錄之，以供生理學家之研究。</p>
<h3 id="c179">笑的總動員 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>

<p>據說笑口常開，是足以健康身子的，所以俗語說得好；笑一笑，少一少，在這一切大事容後再談的現在，且尋幾則笑話來談談，留得靑山在不怕沒柴燒，我們培養成了健全的身體，又何事不可爲呢。所以提倡笑話，他的作用，眞不下開什麽運動會啊！哈哈</p>
<p>白食大王　那位無業遊民趙鈞，靠着他頑健的身子，一次次在酒店飯舖中，騙吃酒食，吃飽了肚皮，抺抹嘴，打個招呼；那些怕事的店家，自認晦氣，聽他揚長而去。有些難說話的店家，除了打他一頓，祇有把他扭人警所，好得他有着頑强的身體，打幾下，固然不在話下，就是扭入警局，拘禁幾天，趙鈞也滿不在心，放了出來，依然我行我素，吃他的白食。這一天趙鈞又以騙吃酒食，扭進了公安局，那位分局長，實在看不過了，親自升座問訊，除問了姓名等例供外，笑喀喀問道。。「你爲什麽要一次一吃白食呢」「趙鈞也笑道：局長，我不吃白食，肚子餓了，不是要餓死的麼」？局長仍笑嘻嘻的說這；不借，你不吃白食，是不能活命的，現在我索性成全了你，請你到敎養習藝所去成年的吃白食罷！局長說時，面色仍是笑嘻嘻的，可是趙鈞面上的笑容竟霎時收歛了。</p>
<p>賭徒趣談　甲乙丙三人，是有名的賭徒；這天他們三人遇見以後，預備實行局賭，他們約好後，就邀請某丁，共义麻雀。他們四人入局以後，當然實行三吃一的抬轎子主義互用着暗號招呼，正在得意洋洋，將某丁抬得飛跑的當兒；那知某丁也是賭中老手，一瞧風頭不對，留神細看，被他將甲乙丙三人的暗號，完全看破。於是他一瞧某甲要筒子，就將筒子送與某甲，某乙要索子，就將索子送與某乙這麼一來，甲乙丙都給某丁弄得像鬼迷的張天師面面相戲，弄得一籌莫展，結果某丁施展手腕，反被贏去了一百多元。里乙丙面面相覷，嘆着氣互相說道：「不料我們這三個轎夫，今日却大做汽車心子，給他兜風兜得作不下主」！（注局賭麻將秘訣三吃，呌「抬轎子」，一吃三，呌，坐汽車」。）</p>
<p>吃蟹噱頭　九月團臍十月尖，在這黄花吐艷的當兒，蟹當然是應時佳味，脂黄充盈，其味無窮，所以這幾天來菜館酒肆中蟹，就成了佐酒佳肴。這天某甲和友人們喝着酒，笑哈哈的說道：一這幾天的蟹，才堪大快朶頥，所以老蟹畢竟是好東西」。某乙笑道：「你不要誇口，你原是飲糟亦醉的人物，老蟹也好，小蟹也好，眞呌做呌化子吃死蟹，隻隻好」。這兩位仁兄，原巳吃得醉醺醺了，爲了老蟹死蟹，你一言，我一語，唇槍舌劍，互相口角起來，相駡得不可開交，又互相摔盃摜碗，翻檯拍凳，某甲的頭，給某乙摔碎了，某乙的嘴，給某甲擊腫了，由崗警將二人用繩縛到警所裏去；明天酒醒以後，甲乙互相嘆着氣說「爲了老蟹，昨夜竟做了兩隻大紮蟹」</p>

<p>無錫的金融大權向來握在錢莊業手中、錢莊放欵主要的對象是絲米兩業、民國十八年絲廠業全盛時代、全縣開車絲廠、共有五十六家、絲車二萬餘部、工友幾近十萬人、絲業發達、錢莊業也隨之增多、兩年內錢莊竟由十家而增加到二十家、對於絲業放欵、十分寬鬆、那時無錫的銀行僅有中國交通上海江蘇等數家、中交兩行、是專做發行鈔票的營業、江蘇上海、雖然也做絲繭放欵、但爲數很少、</p>
<p>民國二十年海外絲市慘落、無錫各絲廠存絲山積、虧蝕殊鉅、粉紛倒閉的約有三十餘家、於是每一家錢莊、都吃了倒賬、少者一二萬、多者十餘萬元、錢業受了這樣一個重大的打擊、元氣大傷、結果新設的錢莊、又一爿一爿的倒閉、去年春天、資力宏偉的寶康潤錢莊、也不能維持而宣吿淸理、到今年爲止、全縣滙劃莊祗有瑞昶潤·福裕·復元·愼餘·永恒豐·源豐仁·德暨·福昌盛·允裕等九家了、</p>
<p>無錫是著名的放欵碼頭、除了絲市放欵以外、首推米業放欵、全縣大小米行共有一百二十餘家、放欵數量、每在夏冬兩季、常達千萬元以上錢業受了深刻的創痛、再也沒有能力經營鉅額放欵、同時也不敢輕易放欵了、於中國交通上海江蘇等四銀行、便乘機大量放欵、因爲米業放欵、都有貨物作抵押品、獲利有把握、銀行業更何樂不爲呢、這樣錢莊的營業、便給銀行奪去了一大半、因此近三年來、上海各銀行都紛紛來錫設立分行、發行鈔票、和經營放欵、同業間競爭頗烈、中國交通江蘇等三銀行、更自造倉庫、專營米糧放欵、現在無錫銀行、共有中國·交通·江蘇·上海·實業·浙江興業·大陸·中南·農民·通商·等十家、上海新華銀行、在第八區蕩口鎭、設立辦事處、專做農村放欵、上海銀行在城中區設立分辦事處、專鬥吸牧存戶、</p>
<p>表面上看來、無鍚的金融業、巳由銀行業巳起而代之（錢業）了、可是事實上怎樣呢、銀行的數量雖然在增加、銀行的營業楚否是比例的擴大呢、這就成了疑問、無錫的米業、年來受了洋米洋麥傾銷的影響、大部份巳難於支持、去冬年荒、各米行營業更寥落不堪、其他如紡織、綢布業、洋貨業等等、都一致的衰頽、銀行放欵的對象、在這去年和今年是這樣地不景氣、試問他本身還能景氣嗎、</p>
<p>今年春天、上海金融界起了絕大的波濤、無錫金融界也受很大的影響、銀行錢莊、緊縮放欵、春繭放欵幾乎大家都不願意經營、放出的繭欵、僅二百萬元、和五年前相較、不及十分之一、秋爾登塲時、絲市飛躍直上、銀錢業受了以往的教訓、依然不敢大量放欵、眞是太把穩了、現在新米上市、各銀行錢莊、還是抱着緊縮政策、不肯輕易放欵、工商市塲更顯出蕭條的狀况、因循下去、不謀一個適當的良策、金融業前途也不知怎樣、（鑑淸）</p>

<p>家叔因虧弱多病。以致吸姻上癮。十年以來。三戒未除。因戒期內胃痛遺精等症叢起。以致半途而廢也。今因政府决心掃毒。功令森嚴。遂不得不遍訪名醫。力求戒烟期內消弭痛苦之法。後承詹念曾醫師囑向中西藥房購服胃痛靈及希米脫氏固精片。分治胃症及多年之遺精。並於戒烟期內服生殖素以資調理。依法並進。果然胃痛遺精毫未發現。且戒期內身體壯健。精神愉快。爲以前所意想不到云。</p>

<p>患者駱槐靑君。胃臟素弱。見食輒厭。消化亦複不良。每苦食滯胃呆。迭服各種胄劑。皆僅取效一時。難奏全功。遂視爲不治痼疾。因循自誤。今夏因親聞其至戚周鼎鐘君所患胃腸疾患。爲余用「胃痛靈」所治愈。卽亦投余處求治。經余吿以所患與周君不同。周君因有胃炎及胃痛等症。故取方以「胃痛靈」爲主。而駱君則完全爲胃弱所致。卽開方囑向華美藥房購服「健胃素」。連服三日。食積盡化。連服數日。胃納旺盛。服完三盒。卽覺胃臟壯鍵。大有能化石卵之勢云。</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>金剛法會，以往會先後修建過兩次。一次建於北平，還有一次則建於杭州。這幾日，本地又在大鬧一白傘蓋息災法會，可謂懿歟盛哉。聞發起人因鑒於魔氛日張，邦家多故，爲消弭刦運起見，特請班禪氏表西藏榮增大師及蒙藏太德，啟建法會三天，冀仗佛力，以脫危難。這算是法會救國。</p>
<p>欲解除國家的憂患，應從合理方面努力，方有效果。藉修建法會以挽厄運，用意或未可厚非，舉動却不免乖謬。爲正社會觀感起見，實亦有加以批評的必要。須知救國爲一艱困工作，全賴實力，不可稍存僥倖之心。而求神託佛的行爲，更非我們所應有。果法會能消災息難，眞是最有力的法寳。我們的國難，只消請幾位大師來作法，便可應付，還用什麽救國運動嗎？</p>
<p>過去的金剛法會，由活佛班禪大師主持，未嘗不轟動一時。但結果所得，却是勞民傷財而已。前不久，羅馬敎皇曾率全世界敎徒，爲和平禱吿三日。後來終於消弭不了東菲的屠殺。</p>
<p>我們在這裏奉勸一般「志在救國」的國人，有心救國，大家應盡一點眞實力量。否則佛法雖大，恐亦不足以解脫我們的刦運。</p>
<h3 id="c208">冬之廣州 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 木棉</p>
<p>冬天與南國好像無緣似的，就以現在說吧，在大江南北該是落葉飄零寒霜滿地的時節了。然而南國的草木仍楚那末靑綠可愛，女人們還穿着蟬翼樣的夏天衣裳，東山和西郊的游泳塲，雖然比較的冷落了。但是仍有着不少靑年人在耀武揚威，那球樣的大榕樹仍然濃蔭滿枝的在長堤那里修整地排列着。正是南國杜鵑花盛開的季侯，娘姨們的木展聲得得價響。和暖的太陽照着穿藍方格子布裙的女學生，誰敢說是冬天了？</p>
<p>算起來已有八年沒有在廣州過冬了。假如今年沒有特別的原因相信在南國避寒的機會是無論如何也不會失去的。</p>
<p>粤秀山上的木棉恐怕快要開花了吧。那鮮紅的花朶疏疏地掛在粗大的樹枝上决不像臘梅的婉麗，更不像桃花的嬌豔那氣概正如一個文采風流的儒將。怪不得木棉又有英雄樹的別名了。</p>
<p>荔枝灣雖然冷落了。但是那些喜歡淸幽閑靜的人又何妨邀三五知已僱支划子蕩乎中流，聽聽兩岸的黄鸚的歌唱。或者伸長了脖兒呼吸一口郊野特有的新鮮空氣？這種悠閒的生活會帶着多少羅曼司的氣氛呀！</p>
<p>大街上，也有着冬季大减價旗子的迎風招展，舖票（按卽發財票之一種）像紙錢一樣隨街飛舞。潮州柑上市了，那碗樣大的柑，會使你垂涎三尺的，也許有一兩家良鄉票子店在最熱閙的馬路上。點綴點綴，那股刺鼻的味兒會使你打噴嚏。洋貨店的無綫電收音機發出那不和諧的粤曲，使人非常不耐煩。茶樓里有一陣粗羼的鑼聲。一股雅片烟的臭味也許從一條小弄堂飄了出來，令你十分難過。</p>
<p>珠江大橋巨人也似的跨過了那急湍的激流。橋上蟻樣的行人，擁擠着。許多靑黄的面孔現出忽忙的表情。他們當中自然少了那赶「番攤館」的賭徒，上，「談話處」的癮君子。</p>
<p>過了大橋，這被稱爲東方蒙的卡羅的河南島就在你的眼前出現了。那「裕泰公司樓上銀牌」的大字先把你的脚步拉緊。一批批面色頹喪的，犯上倖致心理病的賭徒從那狹窄的門走了出來，一批批抱着莫太希望的人又急忙衝了進去。我雖然沒有雜在當中但是這東方蒙的卡羅到底傷了我的心。</p>
<p>決不會像北國冬天的晚上那樣蕭零冷落·午夜時分，你仍可看見那霓紅燈的炫耀·茶樓酒館之類還是那末熱鬧·假如你有興致的說話又不妨走上那僱有女伶度曲的茶樓去消磨一會。</p>
<p>午夜的木屐聲驚醒了人們的好夢。買餛飩的小販敲着梆子，聲音是那末淸脆尖銳，沒有西北風在肆虐，就是你身上只穿着單衣也不會哆嗦。多可愛的南國啊！我願在你懷抱里度過每年的冬天。</p>

<p>當天晚上，星和月亮也失去了光明，整箇的宇宙只是黑漆的一團，她們是萬難再在這壁龕中做神，她們要去創造新的光明，新的溫熱。五個女神就悄悄地在闕後的海面消逝，別了黑色的宇宙。</p>
<h3 id="c210">串楊葉的人 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>在北國的水缸里開始結起薄薄的一層冰的時候，我們年靑人的工作便有了。</p>
<p>故鄉的農村里，到處都可以看到高高的白楊。白楊是一個高大的落葉喬木，每年春天，開始發芽的時侯。會落下一種像毛毛蟲似的「楊巴狗」來的；春天，年靑的小孩子們，就用那凍得發紅的小手去檢拾。一邊和別的伙伴們唱着歌，一邊向小籃裏檢；待到一小籃滿了，就送在離大夥不遠處坐着作活的老祖母那兒去。她總是和靄地接過去，倒在預備好的布包袱裏。就又回來檢。到秋天，楊葉又落了，我們就又來串。</p>
<p>因爲，楊葉是一片片的，那樣肥大，可愛，用手拾是不合適的，就來串。串的方法，是用一隻竹針，（或鐵針）在尾巴上串一隻長長的繩子，在繩子尾巴上又結一個擋頭。這樣，就用個針向那滿地的楊葉上串吧，串滿了，弄到繩上去，串滿了，弄到繩上去，一直等到繩子也滿了，，就拖着這長長的一串送回家去。有時，就多帶幾根繩子，這串滿了再弄那一串。</p>
<p>當我們走進年老的祖母屋裏時，他的牆壁上，時常地都是掛着這些東西。</p>
<p>我爲了讀書，大半的時間，都是住在城裏。秋天，春天的假期，以及專爲年長的學生放的「麥假」，我都住在鄉村。我跟着，在田園，在林頭，望着那些波浪似的麥，那園實的杏，梨，桃，跟着由肥大變爲瘦小，由瘦小變爲肥大的牛，馬，和別的牲口。我從那些人裏學習來許多學校裏所以學習的知識。</p>
<p>而使我永遠不忘的還是那些在一起串楊葉的人們。</p>
<p>這些人，現在回想起來，是有些渺茫了。不過，我見到他們的時侯，還是依然很親熱，他們却被生活壓扎得沒有了往昔的歡悅的興緻。而昔日的伙伴，有的已經作了母親，有的作了商品被販賣，有的依舊在牛尾巴後邊跟着，扶着犁頭，有的像我一樣跑到都市裏來了。在都市裏得到的，又是先死亡而來的飢寒交迫。他們，在受着减薪，裁員，失業，……的壓迫，在生命綫上掙扎。像那些依然在田園的人們一樣，不過是受着兩個形式的壓迫吧了。</p>
<p>頭些時，我遇到那伙伴中的一個。他的體格比我魁梧得多，在幼年時，每記串楊葉也好，拾「楊巴狗」也好，他總是獲得最優良的成績。在五年前，他從吉林那邊轉回家，又跑到都市。</p>
<p>黄浦江的浪頭憤怒地打擊着碼頭的時候，他就在那里，他在那里「吭唷，吭唷，」地工作。</p>
<p>他吿訴我生活的痛苦，使我得到許多啟示。</p>
<p>他把那長着黑烏鳥的毛的臂膀揮動一下，像對着他的伙伴似的，對我說：　你說的話對：還能成輩子吃苦嗎？……」當他的臂一抬的時侯，我好像到那像要毁滅這世界的海濤，向世界的岩石湧起了。</p>
<p>他說：「那些串楊葉的人多着呢」，接着他吿訴我，誰已經死去了，誰在那裏被誰槍斃了，他很淸楚，那些難記的年月時日，他都可以吿訴我。彷彿他的腦子里全是伙伴們的事情。</p>
<p>現在，又是串楊葉的時候了，但是，我正流浪在幾千里外的異鄉，對着這昔日的伙伴一方面表示着無限的敬意，一方面懷念着那吏的多人。</p>

<p>— 吉義</p>
<p>一入了夜，西風就呼呼地吹起，人在薄薄的夾衣裏面，已經會禁不住要打抖了。風在空中的電綫的空罅間呼呼也過去，疏落的行人不整齊地用脚敲着街路：「蹋蹋蹋……」，在遠處，街燈漸漸地密起來，工廠裏的機器把呼吸的聲音吐到外面來，隱約而合拍地起伏。</p>
<p>一條細長而奇形的影子借着前面的街燈投射在荒寂的街路上，王大個子帶着一個發燒的腦子，與被燒酒所浸笨了的舌頭，歪斜地沿着路傍的「東洋房子」走去，於是，突然地，在一個狹小的門口停下了，急促而暴亂地搥着門。</p>
<p>「阿林開門，阿林開門！媽的你這死……」</p>
<p>不淸楚的，帶着酸臭的燒酒味的語音像倒一般地吐出來，於是，拍的一聲，小小的門開了，一個髙大的身驅擋在門裏面，塞滿了門框。</p>
<p>「誰？……你？你要怎麽？你要怎麽哪！」</p>
<p>「要怎麼？別說笑話了罷？前天在塲子裏輸掉的錢，你還打算還不還呢？你說！你老實說！」</p>
<p>「你說得淸楚一點！什麽塲子不塲子呀？」</p>
<p>「哼哼哼」王大個子從喉嚨裏擠出了一串可怕的聲音：「朋友……老闆別說笑話了吧？三塊四毛，在你的塲子裏贏來的！等着去過日子啦！在你底塲子裏也丢掉了不少了啊，老闆，是不是？」（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c212">縹緲晴蠻 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>縹緲峯籠罩在乳白色的朝霧里，初昇的朝陽反射到山巓祗隱約顯露出一個糢糊的輪廓，從鎮夏浜渚上望上去，彷彿似一個初點絳唇的少婦站在一幅藍緞下面；太陽漸漸地升高，而那金黄的色彩也慢慢兒地淡薄了起來。</p>
<p>我和君平分坐了兩輛人力車，向着羅漢圩上去；但是那髙低崎嶇的山道震械得坐在車里的我們，使心臟都幾乎翻了起來，有時行經田塍間，或池沼畔，溪澗傍的當兒，我們心里便會漾起一陣恐懼，生怕車子和人一起跌入了田中和池澗里去。</p>
<p>心里惴惴地隨着車子轉了幾個彎，經過上澗橋，就可看見一座文昌閣。</p>
<p>象桐子別別卜卜的從樹上跌下來，樹葉全成了枯黄，而且空中芷有幾片枯葉在飛舞。那頽舊的文昌閣現在已經改設了私立小學，門前的曠地大概就是那小學的操塲。</p>
<p>再走了幾步，車子已不能拉進去了，我們給了車錢，沿着一條長滿矮松樹的石子小路上走去。皮鞋擦着砂子發出喀嚓喀嚓的聲音。深秋的天氣是那麽地晴和，跑了幾步路就覺得身上巳火辣辣地熟了；額角頭上的汗水巳在像簷漏水般的滴下來，我脫了呢帽，用手帕揩着汗。</p>
<p>「天氣眞熱！」我站着噓了一口氣，君平祇笑了笑沒有話說。</p>
<p>到一棵楊梅樹下去蹲着歇息，吹過一陣微風，帶來了點輕快的凉爽。淸脆而宏亮的瀑布聲在附近的山谷中送出來，於是我們便尋聲向着一條白栗樹叢的小徑里找去。沿着一條小溪，走了十多步路，就看見上下兩塊巨大的石板，那傾瀉如匹紗，倒掛似銀河的瀑布從上面直冲下來，再由下面石板接到一個碧澄深闊的水潭里，衝激出碎銀般的水花。水是淸澈得可愛，澗底里的鵝卵石也歷歷可數的。</p>
<p>「那就是陣頭石板，在黄霉矢這里的瀑布聲是像雷鳴一樣的。」我用手承着冲下來的瀑布，水珠子向臉上濺來。</p>
<p>君平脫去了鞋襪，想要在這淸泉里灌足，但水太冷了，因此將脚剛伸下去，就連忙縮了起來：「太冷，吃不消！」</p>
<p>傍邊石板上留着許多石缺，缺里還有柴灰；那就是遊人到這里來煮泉水茶吃的痕跡。</p>
<p>竹塢嶺山坡正有幾個鄉婦蹲在茅柴叢中刈柴，她們聽見了我們的皮鞋，就不約而同的停住工作站起來，用懷疑的目光對我們望着。</p>
<p>皮鞋底踏在曲折的磚砌山道上，時常有滑跌的危險，我們祗能佝僂着腰向上爬，爬到竹塢嶺的最髙峯上，兩個人全已氣喘吁吁，汗流浹背了。仰望縹渺峯的山頂還有一半那麽高。</p>
<p>西邊有一條羊腸小徑，蜿蜓地直向上展開着，我們擦去了臉上的汗，伸伸直腰，從那條小徑裏繼續往上爬。</p>
<p>縹渺峯頂上有一隻茶亭，裏面有一口石鑿的茶缸，郝是夏天裏鄕人們施茶用的。因爲這是山北山南來的必經要這，日常來往的人是很多的，那隻茶亭就是行人唯一的休息處，這在夏天眞不啻是沙漠中的一個綠洲。</p>
<p>站在峯巓上極目四眺，可以瀏覽全太湖的風景，汪洋三萬六千傾，洞庭七十二奇峯，一切湖光山色盡收眼底，二省三州的輪廓全在萬里波光中起伏者。</p>

<p>「船家女」昨晨十時於金城大戲院試映。該片配音甚佳，尤以「風流寡婦」曲爲最，標準美人徐來誠如某君所說從來沒有做得這樣好。不過應該再「加點生意眼進去」，「怪物」以爲然否？</p>

<p>（一）「海上覇王」公映</p>
<p>國泰大戲院今日公映的「海上覇王」Drakeof　England，爲一烈雄壯歴史海戰鉅片，叙述十六世紀末葉英國民族英雄特萊克的一頁奇跡。特萊克以一個海盜一躍而爲英國海軍大將，朝中大臣，都很反對他的作戰計劃，惟有伊壩莎女皇，獨能深然其說，後來特萊克果然大收西班牙軍，爲英國海軍在歐洲史上增添一頁光榮。片中有火攻一幕，將着火之船，乘風勢衝入敵艦陣中，極爲驚心動魄云。</p>
<p>（二）「愛情萬歲」賣座鼎盛</p>
<p>當代歌劇泰斗聶諾馬鐵尼主濱的「愛情萬歲」Here＇s　To　Romance自前日在大光明開映後，賣座擁擠不堪，良以該片不但情節纏綿哀艷，而馬鐵尼的歌喉，確有敲金戞玉之神，，繞探三匝之味，尙有舞星瑪麗亞主演的「天鵝舞」暨西班牙舞王阿斯柯台綠的吉潑西舞，都係銀幕上不容易看見的東西，很値得一觀云。</p>
<p>（三）「阿國風雲」將映</p>
<p>當此意阿風雲緊張到十二萬分的時候，這一部銀幕上的「阿國風雲」Wings　Over　Ethiopia，一定是值得我們來注意的。在這部片子裏面，它把阿國人情風俗澈底暴露出來，阿王海立西　，不啻做了本片的主角。如獅王軍隊最新戰術的操演，和阿國的防空設備，無不一一映諸銀幕，爲觀衆一新耳目，這片子聽說不久將在大光明公映了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan telegraphed He Yingqin to decline his new position, He replied yesterday to comfort and retain Song. Last night, Song convened a meeting at his private residence with Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, and others. They decided to telegraph He again for the second time, still requesting him to forward their request to the central government to withdraw the appointment. The telegram was sent out last night, stating roughly that the situation in the north is becoming more difficult, and that he, being of meager talent and ability, feels inadequate for the important post of Director of Pacification of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. After sending the telegram of resignation, it was also decided to send Liu Jialuan, Chief of Staff of the Tianjin and Beiping Garrison Headquarters, as Song's personal representative, to Baoding to personally meet Shang Zhen, urging Shang to come to Ping immediately to discuss major plans. Liu left Ping for the south last night. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan received Cheng Ke, Zhang Zizhong, and others at his residence this morning. Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun were also present. They exchanged views on the current situation. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan summoned Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, and others this morning for discussions. He also sent Liu Jialuan, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, to Baoding to invite Shang Zhen to Ping. It is reported that Song will again request to resign from the post of Director of Pacification of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. (29th Central Telegram)</p>
<p>(Baoding) Song Zheyuan sent Liu Jialuan, Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters, as a representative to Baoding to inquire about Shang Zhen's illness. Liu arrived in Baoding at noon on the 29th with Fu Liping, Chief of Staff of the 32nd Army. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Ke came to Ping to meet with Song Zheyuan to discuss measures for maintaining public order in Tianjin. He was originally scheduled to return to Tianjin this morning. However, due to the difficult situation in the capital and the need for thorough discussions on specific measures for maintaining local security, he will remain in Ping temporarily to continue consultations with Song. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Ke has not fully recovered from his illness, and his negotiations with Song Zheyuan on public security matters have not been completed. He plans to stay in Ping temporarily. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After an important meeting of North China personnel this morning, Song Zheyuan immediately telegraphed He Yingqin, urging him to come north to preside over everything. Song believes that the responsibility is too heavy and refuses to assume the post of Director of Pacification of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. Those who attended the meeting this morning included Xiao Zhenying and Zhang Zizhong, Acting Chairman of Chahar Province. Chinese officials acknowledge that the Japanese are pressuring Song Zheyuan to publicly announce his attitude towards the autonomous movement. Today, Song sent his advisor to Baoding to urge Shang Zhen to come to Ping for consultations. At the same time, Xu Yongchang's return to Shanxi has attracted considerable attention here. Xu had recently consulted with Song here on everything. Now, he will report Song's views on the current situation to Yan Xishan. Yan will soon convene a meeting of senior officials in Taiyuan to discuss the North China situation and the attitude Shanxi Province should take. It is reported that Doihara had asked Xu to express his attitude towards the autonomous movement. Xu is expected to return to Ping in two weeks. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs hinted today that Japan is prepared to reverse its policy of non-interference in the North China issue. It is claimed that if Song Zheyuan agrees to take the post of Director of Pacification of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan, Japan sees no reason not to negotiate with him on the North China autonomous movement, as this matter is related to both Japan and "Manchukuo."

<p>(Nanjing) Huo Shi, the former director of the Gubeikou Office of the Aoyu District Commissioner, was appointed by the traitor Yin Rugeng as the director of the pseudo-autonomous region's foreign affairs office after Yin Rugeng usurped the title of autonomy. Huo was deeply indignant and, being in a dangerous situation, had no choice but to pretend to cooperate while secretly escaping to Ping in the name of going to Ping before traveling south. He arrived in the capital on the evening of the 28th. At 10 a.m. on the 29th, he took a memorial to Peng Xuepei, Director of the Political Affairs Office of the Executive Yuan, reporting on Yin's usurpation of autonomy and his own unwavering stance. Peng expressed his deep sympathy and forwarded the original memorial to the President of the Executive Yuan. According to Huo, he received a call from Yin at Gubeikou on the 24th, instructing him to go to Tongzhou. He went there on the 25th. At that time, Yin immediately convened a meeting of his subordinates, took out the prepared telegram for autonomy, and instructed everyone to sign it. He politely refused to sign, but due to the harsh environment, he felt pangs of conscience and was in great pain. Yin then appointed him as the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office. He thought it would be best to play along, taking the opportunity to go to Ping, make contact with the embassies, and escape from this dangerous situation. At that time, the rebels insisted on sending a Japanese person to accompany him, but he repeatedly rejected this as inappropriate. After arriving in Ping alone on the evening of the 26th, he immediately published a statement in the newspaper that he had not participated in the pseudo-organization and that due to the urgency of time, he had not had time to go to Baoding to meet Chairman Shang of Shanxi to report on his experiences. He then took a train south. On the morning of the 29th, he visited Director Peng and was greatly comforted. He felt deeply ashamed. After visiting various central authorities to report on his experiences, he plans to go to Shanghai and then return to his native Guangdong. Peng Xuepei said that Huo Shi visited him on the morning of the 29th and had a memorial detailing his vow not to submit to the rebels and his escape. This proves Huo's loyalty to his duties and his determination not to submit to the rebels. In addition to expressing his sympathy, he has forwarded Huo's original memorial to the President of the Executive Yuan. Huo has provided a detailed report on the current situation in the 22 counties of the war zone, and a telegram has been sent from Beijing to Chairman Shang reporting on his escape and arrival in Beijing. (29th Special Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Yin Rugeng's rebellion, people across the country have issued stern denunciations. Huo Shi, the director of the Gubeikou Office of the Jiyu District Administrative Commissioner's Office, resolutely defected due to Yin's traitorous and disorderly conduct. He arrived in the capital last night. The reporter met with Mr. Huo at a certain place this morning. What he said is recorded below: Huo said that on the 25th, he suddenly received an order from the traitor Yin at the Gubeikou Office to go to Tongxian. After arriving in Tong, he learned that Yin had announced the organization of the so-called "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee," betraying the country, breaking away from the central government, and willingly being used by a certain party. Yin also used the position of Director of Foreign Affairs to lure him. Driven by his conscience, although he was powerless to stop it, he was determined not to be an accomplice to the traitor. On the evening of the 26th, he took the opportunity to escape, claiming to visit embassies in Ping. He arrived in the capital last night. Before leaving, he published a statement in the newspaper declaring his severance of relations with the rebels. Yin's rebellion was entirely for his personal gain. In addition to implementing and promoting his policy of poisoning the war zone with opium and heroin, he was also willing to be a puppet. However, his organization is complex and the internal situation is not uniform. There are still many people who will defect after him. The people in the local area are extremely indignant. Yin's demise will not be far off. This morning, he reported Yin's rebellion to Director Peng of the Executive Yuan and telegraphed Chairman Shang of Hebei Province. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the traitor Yin Rugeng rebelled in eastern Hebei and formed a pseudo-autonomous committee, he invited Huo Shi, the director of the Jiyu District Office in Gubeikou, to participate as a member of the committee and appointed him as the pseudo-director of foreign affairs. Huo was deeply dissatisfied with Yin's rebellious behavior. Therefore, when Yin issued a pseudo-declaration, he politely refused to sign it. Yin then sent Huo to Ping to negotiate and planned to send an advisor to accompany him. Huo refused, saying that the advisor did not understand foreign languages, and went to Ping alone. After arriving in Ping, he secretly went south with Yin Tiyang, the traitor Yin's nephew. It turned out that Tiyang was also deeply indignant at the traitor Yin's rebellion. The two arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 28th. Yin went to Shanghai, and Huo plans to draft a written report and submit it to the Executive Yuan within a few days. Huo is a native of Guangdong and studied in Japan in his early years. This time, he resolutely broke away from the rebels in the midst of danger, clarified right and wrong, and upheld justice, which is highly praised by those who know him. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Huo Shi, the situation in Gubeikou and his personal feelings and thoughts are as follows: I have been working in Gubeikou for two years, and the stimulation and pain I have suffered are beyond description. I am very pleased to be able to return safely to the south now. The current situation in Gubeikou is extremely miserable. A few days before I left Gubeikou, thousands of Japanese troops had arrived, and the order was extremely chaotic. Even the office buildings were occupied. The Japanese side claimed that the military strength would be increased to a mixed brigade. I am willing to report the situation of the rebels to the authorities and continue to work hard, be loyal to the party and the country, eliminate the rebels, and revive the nation. As long as I am alive, this ambition will not be slackened and will be carried out to the end. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The British government, which has always been quietly observing the situation in North China, believes that the Japanese government is related to the North China autonomous movement, and has instructed the Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Weiyin, to inquire about the Japanese government's true intentions. Regarding his visit to Vice Minister Shigemitsu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 27th, Chargé d'Affaires Weiyin said that the British government has received information that Japanese officials stationed in China are carrying out various schemes to promote the separation of North China administration. What is the Japanese government's policy on the issue of North China's administrative separation from the central government?

Finally, he stated that participants should maintain a completely objective attitude, avoiding (1) personal biases and (2) prejudices. He added that everyone had served the party and the country for a long time and that everyone could share and trust the "purity" and "fairness" of these two spirits. He concluded by offering these thoughts to everyone. Chairman Lin then delivered a speech, briefly saying that everyone had worked hard in service to the party and the country, and he admired them. In this time of national crisis, he especially hoped that politics could get on track, and the prerequisite for that was the careful selection of good talents. He hoped that everyone would do their best in both examination and personnel selection to achieve the goal of obtaining true talent. Regarding the legal aspects, the most important thing was to be fair. All the accumulated grievances of the people should be handled quickly and fairly. As for the impeachment of officials, the comrades in the Supervisory Yuan could impeach any exploitative officials to rectify officialdom and establish good morals. If the above three items could be achieved, then politics could get on track. He hoped that everyone would act according to the oath they had taken, which said, "Implement the law and devote oneself to one's duties with loyalty and diligence," and not fail the country's entrustment.

<h3 id="e18">Huang and Su Loan Negotiations Fail <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London recently reported that commercial loan negotiations were underway between Britain and the Soviet Union. Britain intended to provide a loan to the Soviet Union for the purpose of purchasing British goods such as railway materials, and it was said that a portion of the loan amount might be used to repay part of the old debts owed to Britain from the Tsarist era. However, according to TASS news, these negotiations did not take place. The Soviet authorities also stated that pre-revolutionary loans were completely unrelated to current loan issues and that the Soviet Union would not allow them to be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>In recent years, Anglo-Soviet relations have fluctuated between tension and relaxation. The opposition of political systems is the root cause of the inability of the two countries to truly be on good terms. Soviet assistance to colonies seeking to secede from their mother countries, British arrangements for an anti-Soviet front, and the issue of repaying old debts have all caused the relationship between the two parties to often trend toward isolation. However, we cannot assume that there will be absolutely no room for coordination between the two countries. There are indeed many areas where they mutually benefit. To name the most obvious, Britain is eagerly anticipating the Soviet Union's vast market, and the Soviet Union is also very willing to accept the assistance of foreign capital. Moreover, in terms of the current international situation, the recent tensions in the Far East and Europe and Africa may somewhat ease the degree of opposition between the two countries. Although the rumors of loan negotiations from London this time have not been realized, it can be imagined that the British side already has this intention. According to our observation, it seems that this time Britain's needs from the Soviet Union are more urgent than the Soviet Union's needs from Britain. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p>First, in recent years, Britain's foreign markets have been shrinking. The penetration of goods and capital from Japan, the United States, and other countries into the colonies has been quite profound. Currently, the Japanese influence in the Chinese market is shaking Britain's inherent superior position. Canada's tendency to lean toward the United States is becoming increasingly apparent. Many Britons believe that the newly revised US-Canada trade agreement means that Canada's affiliation with Britain will inevitably lose its meaning one day. They are also worried about the collapse of the Ottawa Imperial Trade Agreement. All of this is enough to prove the distress of British goods and capital seeking outlets. The Soviet Union has a vast territory and rich purchasing power, making it an excellent market.</p>
<p>Second, the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy have made the situation in Europe and Africa quite precarious. (Recently, there was also the outbreak of the Egyptian demand for complete independence.) Japan has penetrated deeply into China, and the situation in the Pacific is treacherous. Based on these extremely tense international situations, Britain needs a strong supporter in the Far East and the Near East. The Soviet Union, dominating Eurasia, is a good target for Britain.</p>
<p>As for the Soviet Union, in order to implement its policy of peace to facilitate the completion of domestic construction, it is happy to maintain better relations with Britain. It also has a great need to utilize foreign capital for construction, so borrowing from Britain to purchase goods should also be expected by the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>However, hope is one thing, and whether the facts can be achieved is another. Currently, Anglo-Soviet relations do have the above-mentioned conditions for mutual benefit. But it is not entirely true to say that the loan will certainly be established and that relations will certainly be close. The future of these negotiations will likely face at least the following difficulties, which must be overcome.</p>
<p>1.  The issue of political opposition: If Britain does not stop its role as an anti-Red protagonist, or if the Soviet Union does not give up its assistance to colonial revolutions, the relationship between the two countries will have no way to improve.</p>
<p>2.  The issue of old debts: If the Soviet Union expresses its unwillingness to repay the old debts of the Tsarist era, then the British public will definitely oppose taking on new debts, which may cause a considerable setback in the negotiations.</p>
<p>3.  Trade issues: It is said that both Britain and the Soviet Union have expressed their hope to expand export trade. Then, during negotiations on trade agreements, a state of opposition may arise.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we believe that Anglo-Soviet negotiations are by no means a simple matter. Even if the two countries can reach some kind of agreement in the future, it is feared that it will not be possible to proceed without following a winding path.</p>

<p>(London) According to official announcements, the talks between French Prime Minister Laval and British Ambassador Clerk yesterday were "highly satisfactory" and can almost be considered a shortcut to restoring peace in Abyssinia. As for British Foreign Office Abyssinia expert Penderson, he is still in Paris talking with French Foreign Office Director of East Africa, Sangandan. The Foreign Office has already received Penderson's report, but it believes that before the talks can continue to progress, the Foreign Office must first conduct a thorough study of the report. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Associated Press learned today from absolutely reliable sources that France has sternly replied to Italy's warning regarding the implementation of the oil embargo. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with Italian Ambassador Cerutti today and delivered the reply in person. It is understood that Laval also warned Italy that any acts of war, such as an Italian attack on British warships, would be considered an act of war against all member states of the League of Nations, and France would not be able to stand aside. The leaders of Britain and France believe that the time for peace negotiations is now ripe, and it is understood that the British and French ambassadors to Italy have both been ordered to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to secretly express the conditions for stopping the war in East Africa. Laval believes that Italy will accept the non-Amhara provinces that the Italian army has already conquered as conditions for a truce, so he is eager to conduct diplomatic negotiations to prevent Mussolini from taking risks after the world implements the oil embargo. As for Mussolini's claim that Italy will consider the oil embargo as an act of war and will respond with an act of war, opinions here are divided as to whether this is a bluff or whether Italy is indeed prepared to launch a European war. (National Press dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Ambassador to France Clerk paid a visit to Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval the day before yesterday and held talks. According to the Paris Echo and Business Daily, the British ambassador told Laval that Italy had misunderstood France's attitude and that a dangerous international situation had arisen. Therefore, Laval should notify Rome that the British and French views are completely consistent. The British ambassador also said that Italy mistakenly believes that France is taking a neutral stance on the Italo-Abyssinian issue. It must be known that if an Italian warship were to bomb any British warship in the Mediterranean, it would not only be an act of aggression against the British Empire but also an act of aggression against all member states of the League of Nations, including France. Therefore, the French Prime Minister should immediately notify the Italian government that if Italy carries out its threats, cooperation between Britain and France will be inevitable. Laval, upon hearing the British ambassador's words, agreed to do so. When Laval received Italian Ambassador Cerutti yesterday, he seemed to have told him that if Italy were to take risks, the consequences would be unimaginable. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The London Daily Mail points out that Laval's conversation with the Italian ambassador has dispelled the doubts of last week and says that the sanctions implemented in Geneva next week will make Italy's war unsustainable. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italy's threatening remarks in response to the proposal to impose an oil embargo may not sway the views of various countries. Current general opinion strongly advocates that the Committee of Eighteen should meet early next week to show that the League of Nations is determined to deal with this issue. However, French Prime Minister Laval will be unable to come to Geneva next week, so the Committee of Eighteen may not be able to meet until the second week of December. Although some quarters believe that Laval's attitude is to delay the decision, it is widely believed that if the Committee of Eighteen decides on an oil embargo, France will not obstruct its implementation. The League of Nations is confident that if Geneva takes action, the United States will actively follow suit. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the Committee of Eighteen, Portuguese representative Vasco Gonçalves, contacted representatives of the governments of the countries concerned by telephone for the purpose of setting a meeting date. French Prime Minister Laval replied that he was still willing to attend in person. Vasco Gonçalves intends to decide on a date this afternoon. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The Committee of Eighteen was originally scheduled to meet tomorrow, but the meeting was postponed because French Prime Minister Laval was detained in Paris due to domestic political affairs and did not have time to go to Geneva. According to news from Geneva, the host country representative of the League of Nations, Portuguese representative Vasco Gonçalves, may decide on a new date for the meeting tomorrow. The duties of the committee are to accept the reports of the experts handling economic and financial sanctions against Italy and to continue to consider the proposal submitted by the Canadian representative and approved in principle by various countries to ban the transport of coal, iron, and oil to Italy.

<p>(London) Roman officials remain tight-lipped about the recent troop movements, but according to travelers arriving in South Tyrol, large-scale troop movements are currently underway in northern Italy. Of the seven divisions under the control of the Bolzano Command, only three divisions remain to defend the Brenner Pass, the lowest mountain pass in the Alps and the gateway to Italy from Germany. It is said that in the past 48 hours, three Italian divisions have been transferred from Riara to the border between Italy and France. A regiment of light cavalry will also travel to southern Italy to take on special duties related to coastal defense. It is also said that a large number of military supplies are currently being transported from South Tyrol to southern Italy. Northern Italy stationed 500,000 troops this summer, but after the current transfer is completed, the troops stationed in northern Italy will be less than 30,000, which shows the importance of the Brenner Pass. The situation in Italy at the moment does not seem as tense as elsewhere. Residents of South Tyrol are alarmed by rumors that Mussolini will soon issue a general mobilization order and that soldiers and Blackshirt comrades will not be allowed to take leave. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A special dispatch from our reporter: The movement of Italian main force troops in recent days is a precautionary measure to cope with all future events, not only to strengthen the defenses of the Alps. The Italian government has not increased troops in the African colony of Libya, nor does it intend to reduce the garrison there, because the issue of the balance of power in the Mediterranean will be raised at the London Naval Conference, and there is no need to take urgent action at this time. Officials are keeping the troop movements secret, and no newspapers have published a word about them, but it is generally known that this action also serves to support diplomatic activities, so as to prevent countries participating in sanctions from banning the import of oil into Italy.

<p>(Rome) Italy's resistance to sanctions has even affected music and drama. The Propaganda Ministry has ordered a ban on the performance of plays and musical scores by writers from countries participating in the sanctions, with the exception of the works of British playwrights Shakespeare and Shaw and French writers, because the French intellectual class has a more moderate attitude toward Italy. In various concerts, the music of countries participating in the sanctions is also being censored. Performers, singers, and dancers from countries participating in the sanctions are not allowed to perform in Italy.

<p>Addis Ababa. The Abyssinian Emperor traveled by car to Tesci, in the Wolo province of the northern front, at 10:15 a.m. yesterday to inspect the troops and encourage morale. The entourage consisted of three cars and four trucks. The Minister of Finance, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, the Emperor's private secretary, and the royal physician were in the same car as the Emperor. The Empress, along with the two princesses and the youngest son, traveled in another car, but only accompanied the Emperor for 20 kilometers before returning to the capital. Other dignitaries, such as former Army Minister Balu, traveled in the third car. Two trucks were used to transport food, and two trucks were used to carry 25 guards. The Emperor traveled incognito, but the heavy security in front of the palace at the time of departure allowed the people to surmise that the Emperor was on tour. Many residents surrounded the palace, cheering and paying respects to the imperial vehicle. Last night, the Emperor stayed overnight in Teblatpong, 150 kilometers from the capital. He is expected to arrive in Tesci tonight and then fly to the front line in Tigray province for inspection. Mules and trucks transported food along the Emperor's route.

<p>(Moscow) Some foreign newspapers have claimed that an Anglo-Soviet loan agreement would be concluded because former British holders of old Russian bonds would receive partial compensation. TASS learned from the Soviet authorities that the two sides had never held negotiations on this agreement and could not negotiate on it because pre-revolutionary debts were completely unrelated to the current loan issue and the Soviet Union would never allow them to be mentioned in the same breath. (TASS dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Paris, World Press dispatch. The influential left-wing organization "L'Œuvre" predicted in an editorial that after the new developments in North China, there would be an early union between Britain and Russia. The newspaper stated that the British government was very concerned about Japan's actions in China. Observers in British diplomatic circles believed that the only way left for Britain to resist Japan's actions in China was to reach an understanding with Soviet Russia regarding the two countries' actions in the Far East. The newspaper believed that to promote this understanding, the British government would lend the Soviet Union a loan of £25 million to £45 million in exchange for the Soviet capital's gold reserves being deposited in the Bank of England in order to stabilize the exchange rate of the ruble.</p>

<p>Athens. It was learned here today from reliable sources that King George II of Greece is determined to grant amnesty to all political prisoners, otherwise he intends to leave the country. It is also heard that George has told Prime Minister Kondylis that if the army leaders openly reject the plan to grant amnesty to the Venizelists, he still intends to go abroad. Demetrios, who was ordered yesterday to form a cabinet to succeed Kondylis, is still holding meetings with the leaders of the major political parties. After he is able to form a new cabinet, it can probably be finally decided whether George is the true ruler of Greece. (National Telegram on the 28th)</p>

<p>(London) Chinese antiquities were publicly exhibited today at Burlington House in London. The exhibit includes 4,000 items, of which approximately 800 were specially obtained from the Forbidden City in Beijing by the Chinese government. The British monarch also contributed several Chinese antiquities to the display. The largest item in the venue is a Buddha statue, said to weigh 20 tons. The smallest items include bronze mirrors dating back over 2,000 years. The jade artifacts are particularly exquisite, including a jade钺 (battle-axe) from 2000 BC. There are also three jade seals connected to each other by delicate chains, carved from a single piece of rare yellow jade. In addition to porcelain, pottery, bronze, and textiles, there are also masterpieces of calligraphy, painting, and lacquer carving. According to experts, the collection of so many Chinese art objects in one place is a grand occasion unprecedented in history. (28th, Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Stalin's Mother <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Tbilisi Correspondent: A correspondent from TASS visited Stalin's mother, Ekaterina, and wrote the following:</p>
<p>We entered a small, cozy apartment with many well-lit, simply furnished rooms. The first thing that caught our eye was a huge photograph of Lenin. On a round table was a vase filled with fresh flowers, and several recent newspapers. On a sofa in front of the table sat Stalin's mother, simply dressed with a black shawl over her head. She wore horn-rimmed glasses and was reading a newspaper when we entered. We shook her old, thin hand. When we spoke about her son, her eyes filled with joy, expressing her tenderness and contentment. She said:</p>
<p>"I met with Soso... It had been a long time since I had seen him. My health is not good, and I often feel weak, but when I saw him, I was extremely happy, as if I had grown a pair of wings. My weakness and illness vanished.</p>
<p>"Our Lavrentiy (Secretary of the Regional Committee of the Federal Communist Party) said that Soso had arrived, that he was here, and could come in at any time.</p>
<p>"The door opened, and he stepped over the threshold. It was my own son! I looked and could hardly believe my old eyes. He was very happy too; he ran over and kissed me. He looked very well, happy, joyful, and tenderly asked about my health, relatives, and friends.</p>
<p>"Suddenly, I saw the silver strands in my son's hair. I said, 'What's this? Son! Has your hair turned gray too?' He replied, 'Don't worry about it, Mother! Gray hair doesn't matter. I feel very good. Don't worry about my hair.'</p>
<p>"I also asked about my grandchildren. I love them more than anything in the world! My Svetlana, Yasha, and Vanso. Soso joked that Svetlana had sent him to ask Grandma for some plum jam. Soso also loves plum jam; he has been like that since he was little.</p>
<p>"Time passed quickly. We are all old now, friends and relatives. He told many jokes, and we laughed. We sat together for a long time; I was very happy because I had Soso with me.</p>
<p>"Later, Soso went to see his friends, and I stayed home alone. I thought about the past. Besides Soso, I had two other sons, but they died early, leaving only him. I thought about how I wanted to educate my son, how I sent him to school in Gori (a small town in the Caucasus). He was a good student. But his father, my late husband Vissarion, decided to take him out of school to teach him his own trade! To be a shoemaker.</p>
<p>"I did my best to oppose it, even arguing with my husband, but it was no use; he had his way.</p>
<p>"But after a short time, I was victorious again and sent Soso back to school. He was considered one of the best students in the school and received a stipend of three rubles per day."</p>
<p>We listened quietly and attentively to the old lady's slow speech. She told us about her life with her son in Gori: to make a living, she had to do all kinds of hard work herself. She spoke of how her son read as a child, and how he taught others; even as a small child, he taught many neighboring children to read and write.</p>
<p>She also talked about other times, about when Stalin began to do revolutionary work. She spoke of the bitter days she lived through when her son was in exile in Siberia.</p>
<p>We looked with her at a photograph of Stalin as a child, a family photo from when he entered high school. We looked at her corner wall, where several of Stalin's best photographs were hung, right by her bed. On one of the photos was Stalin's autograph written in Georgian.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ekaterina continued: "Soso soon returned from his walk with his friends. We talked for a long time again. I treated him with all the best things, and didn't forget to give him a jar of plum jam to take to Svetlana.</p>
<p>"But the time was short; the time for parting came too quickly. Soso ran over and kissed me very gently. I was reluctant to part with him, and tears came to my eyes, but I restrained myself. I didn't want my son to know how reluctant I was to let him go, because I knew very well that he was busy and had many important things to do."</p>
<p>That is how our visit ended. We bid her farewell, thanking her for her warm hospitality, and left her deeply moved! The room of the old woman who had given the world its great leader. (TASS)</p>

<h3 id="e34">French Parliament Debates Budget; Agenda Prioritizes Finance Over Party Disputes; Laval Cabinet Achieves Preliminary Victory Yesterday <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies resumed its meeting at 9:30 this morning to discuss the government's financial policy. A small number of deputies were in attendance, including Premier and Foreign Minister Laval and Finance Minister Regnier. Communist Deputy Dorès and Socialist Deputy Olivier spoke in succession, attacking the government's current policy, stating that the government's delegated legal decrees had failed to balance the budget. Although wages had been greatly reduced, economic recovery had not been effective, and retail prices had not decreased. Left-wing Republican Deputy Daladier then spoke in support of the government, saying that if a cabinet change were to occur, all hope for economic recovery would vanish, which would be extremely dangerous. At this point, Radical Party Deputy Clerc rose to refute the arguments made by the Communist Deputy, saying that the standard of living had decreased by 28% in the last four years. The Chamber of Deputies then extended the meeting until 3:00 PM to continue the discussion. (29th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today was the day the French Parliament reconvened. A light rain fell on the streets of Paris, and pedestrians could not linger, so the whole city was quiet and no disturbances were seen. The Chamber of Deputies met at 3:10 PM. Premier Laval immediately requested the Chamber to discuss the interpellation on the government's financial policy, while the interpellation on the activities of fascist groups would be discussed next Tuesday. The Chamber then began to debate the procedural issue, causing controversy. Premier Laval said, "In terms of domestic affairs, the financial problem is the most urgent at present. The government must have full authority to deal with the financial crisis, so it cannot be delayed until after this afternoon." Blum, the leader of the orthodox socialists, spoke out against the discussion procedure proposed by Laval, saying, "If the government wants to unite with the parliament and gain the parliament's trust, why did it delay until November 28th to convene the parliament? The delay in the resumption of sessions of both chambers this time has already broken the previous record. It seems Laval could delay the date of convening the parliament again, and then the budget for next year could be promulgated by delegated legal decrees." Blum's words were sarcastic. Laval replied calmly, "Yes, if that were possible, I would do it." At this time, the extreme left deputies responded with jeers. (According to comments from deputies after the adjournment, Laval's words meant that the government could temporarily use the 1935 budget as the budget for next year, as the previous Poincaré cabinet had done.) Blum then advised the Chamber, saying that the deputies of the Chamber were mostly Republicans, and should now rise up to criticize the government. At this point, Premier Laval treated the procedural issue as a question of confidence in the government, and immediately put it to a vote. In the end, the vote of confidence in the government passed by a majority of 345 votes to 225, adopting the discussion procedure proposed by Premier Laval. Speaker Puisson then announced the start of the discussion on the interpellation on financial policy. Only one or two deputies spoke, and the Chamber adjourned at 6:50 PM, to continue the discussion tomorrow morning. The interpellation on financial policy will likely be discussed tomorrow morning and afternoon, and then a vote will be taken. The interpellation on the activities of fascist groups will be discussed next Tuesday, so the fate of the Laval cabinet will be decided after the debate next Tuesday. On the question of the vote of confidence in the government today, the number of votes cast by the Radical Socialist Party was crucial. Of the 160 seats held by Radical Socialist deputies, about 80 voted in favor of the vote of confidence, more than 50 voted against the vote of confidence, and more than 20 abstained. All of the 95 Socialist deputies, 10 Communist deputies, and 15 other extreme left deputies voted against the vote of confidence in the government. (28th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) This afternoon, the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the government by a vote of 345 to 225. This indicated that the Chamber of Deputies agreed with Premier Laval's request to debate the government's financial policy first. The authorities initially feared that the government would be overthrown or riots would occur during the Chamber's debate today, so they took strict precautions and maintained local order during the debate. Another 170 guards were stationed near the Chamber of Deputies with live ammunition to prevent accidents. Today's meeting started at 3:00 PM and adjourned at 7:00 PM. The meeting will continue tomorrow morning at 9:30. The financial debate will likely end tomorrow night, and the Premier can be assured of majority support. Today's meeting was related to the survival of the government, and all cabinet members were in attendance. After the deputies were seated, Laval rose and declared that he would not evade the debate, and also said that the leaders of the various parties had held a meeting and decided to include the discussion on the affairs of the Fascist Party and the National League on the agenda for Tuesday morning, and also decided to discuss the budget bill this afternoon. Everyone applauded to express their approval. Laval continued, saying that if the Chamber was willing, the government intended to allow discussion of Mr. Deng Wen's report on the Fascist Party and the National Federation, and the government did not intend to avoid any responsibility, but if a vote of confidence was to be held, then all votes should be cast. Leader of the inflationists, Reynaud, then declared that all political disturbances must be stopped now, and the budget bill should be discussed first. Socialist leader Blum opposed delaying the discussion of the affairs of the Fascist Party and the National Federation, so a vote of confidence in the government was held. Of the 160 Radical Party deputies, 8 voted for the government, 50 voted against, and the rest either abstained or were absent. All of the extreme left parties voted against the government.

<p>(Manila) The "China Clipper," the first large flying boat to carry mail across the Pacific Ocean, has now completed its entire journey and landed in Manila Bay at 3:36 this afternoon. Several hundred people watched. The plane departed from San Francisco six days ago, but actually flew for only five days. It stopped in Guam for one day for Thanksgiving. After the plane landed, 100,000 letters were taken out, mostly sent by stamp collectors in the United States. The letters and parcels will be transported to the post office by special vehicles, and then the post office will sort out those destined for China and send them to Hong Kong by mail ship. Captain Edsick and the other pilots then went ashore and said that they had departed from Guam this morning and no accidents had occurred en route. It has not yet been announced when the plane will fly back to the United States, but it will probably be in a few days. (29th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Manila) The 25-ton China Clipper flying boat, which took off from Alameda on October 22nd to make the first regular mail flight across the Pacific, should arrive here this afternoon. The time will be around 3:30 or 4:00. Manila is preparing to welcome it with great excitement. It is expected that the entire city's population will come out to see the large flying boat land. It is believed that a new era in the relationship between the United States and the Philippines will begin from this point. This boat will complete the unprecedented 8,000-mile journey today. It is carrying two tons of mail. When it first flew from San Francisco to Honolulu, there were only seven people on board, but when it took off from Honolulu, it carried a total of fourteen people. (29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Manila: The China Clipper landed here at 3:30 this afternoon, taking seven days to complete its 8,500-mile journey from San Francisco to Manila. When the flying boat landed in Manila Bay, the spectators along the coast cheered. Several naval aircraft soared through the sky, and warships in the harbor fired salutes to pay their respects. After Captain Musick landed, the representative of Manila presented him with the keys to the city. Musick then gave a radio address, expressing his gratitude for the warm welcome in the Philippines, and said that it was only after more than five years of long and careful preparation that it was possible to make the journey. Musick later presented President Quezon with a special letter from President Roosevelt. This boat came from Guam, traveling 1,700 miles and rising to an altitude of 10,000 feet, without seeing any ships. It is now scheduled to fly back on December 2nd. The Philippine Post Office has sold stamps worth US$25,000. This boat is the largest aircraft built by the United States, can carry 51,000 pounds, and has a maximum speed of 180 miles per hour, powered by four 800-horsepower engines. Captain Musick is 41 years old, has been in the aviation industry for 22 years, has flown over 10,000 hours, and has traveled over 1 million miles without any accidents. He has an excellent record. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Manila) The China Clipper arrived over here at 3:00 this afternoon, circled for about half an hour, and then landed. The pilot landed at 4:05 PM. The Minister of Public Works and Communications and the Mayor of Manila warmly welcomed him. The Mayor presented Captain Musick with the keys to the city of Manila. President Quezon welcomed him at the Malacañang Palace. Captain Murdock presented President Quezon with the airmail from US President Roosevelt. (29th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Guam: The China Clipper flew to Manila at 6:06 this morning. Guam Naval Governor Captain Alexander and others personally saw Captain Edsick and the plane's personnel off. 15,000 of the island's 20,000 residents watched the plane take off. (29th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e36">Prospects for the Naval Conference; Britain Not Optimistic; US Expanding Pacific Aviation; Japan to Raise New Demands <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Naval Conference is scheduled to open on December 6th. The political circles here are now discussing the impact of this conference on the British government's plan to expand British defense. If the major powers reach any agreement on the tonnage and types of warships, or the caliber of artillery, then British procedure will naturally be affected. It is reported that the British government believes that the more restrictions agreed upon at the Naval Conference, the less funds the British Treasury will have to raise for the naval program. The preliminary talks that have taken place have not inspired much hope for a restrictive agreement. However, the British government is not optimistic about the outcome of the conference, but hopes that some achievements can be made. The conference will be chaired by British Prime Minister Baldwin. Representatives from all major naval powers will attend. The leaders of the British delegation are Foreign Secretary Hoare and Naval Secretary Monsell. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) According to diplomatic sources, the situation in the Far East will have a great impact on the Naval Conference to be held in London on December 6th. Japan will insist on demands for naval equality with Britain and the United States. Britain and the United States will reject this demand because Japan disregards the Nine-Power Treaty. The Nine-Power Treaty was one of the agreements concluded at the Washington Conference in 1922, and the naval superiority of Britain and the United States at the time was the force that brought about this situation. Therefore, if this naval superiority is not maintained, the treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity will be equal to waste paper. It is also reported that Britain will use the League of Nations to maintain its position in China. This is the true reason why Britain invited the League of Nations to send representatives to the Naval Conference. The British government asked Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota to explain what the Japanese army intends to do in North China, which is enough to show Britain's concern for the new situation between China and Japan. (29th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(London) The Naval Conference has been postponed to December 9th because the US delegation is unable to arrive early. (29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) According to a report in the "Hai Ri Dian Wen Bao," when the Naval Conference opens, the Japanese representatives will likely propose to expand Article 19 of the Washington Naval Treaty, which prohibits the relevant countries from expanding naval bases in the Pacific. Japan's proposal is based on the recent opening of Pacific aviation by Pan American Airways, saying that US Pacific aviation, via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam, to Manila, is actually giving the US fleet a bridge to approach the Sea of Japan, which is of great military importance. (29th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) The "Shi Zhe Bao" recently published an article commenting on the upcoming London Naval Conference, saying that Britain's real danger lies in the Far East. If Britain can reach an agreement with the Mediterranean powers to respect each other's rights, so that Britain can act freely in the rest of the world, that would be the best policy. (28th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) US Secretary of the Navy Swanson, in response to a visit from a Washington press corps, said that the fundamental policy of the United States in the London Naval Disarmament Conference is still to adhere to building warships within the limits of the existing treaty, and to be consistent with President Roosevelt's statement that the US government absolutely opposes the world's navies falling into chaotic competition again. However, if Japan disregards its environment and resolutely makes new demands for equality to expand its navy, then the United States will definitely strengthen the military defenses of the Pacific islands as a countermeasure. If Japan demands the same naval power as the United States, then the United States will be affected and will still feel that the Pacific facilities are insufficient. Since observing the establishment of the new government in the Philippines, there has been no indication that it will build its own navy. What kind of necessity does Japan have to expand? However, the United States will never allow the Philippines to be under the threat of Japan. Moreover, Japan's new demands for naval equality will probably not be supported by the representatives of the other countries. (29th, Japanese United News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday and protested, saying that recently, in the Heilongjiang, Songhua River, and Ussuri River regions, fishing boats flying the Japanese flag have repeatedly sailed. According to the Aigun Treaty of 1858, these rivers cannot be sailed by ships other than those of the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo." He hoped that the Japanese government would crack down on this type of sailing. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that he had not heard of Japanese ships sailing, so he did not know the details. The Aigun Treaty was signed between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo," and Japan does not bear direct responsibility. After listening to the opinions of the country concerned, Manchukuo, he will reply. Ambassador Yurenev also urged the Japanese side to respond to the issue of establishing a joint Soviet-Manchukuo committee, and then left. (29th, Dentsu Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) An Associated Press reporter spoke with Sir Sassoon today. He stated that as long as China strictly adheres to its current financial policy, foreign exchange will stabilize at its current price and will not change again. Even if Japan incites the autonomy movement in North China, it will not harm the effect of stabilization. Sir Sassoon also said that no matter what it looks like on the surface, there will be no political changes in China. The current Chinese government is actually more powerful than it has ever been. The rumors that China's financial policy is actually the proposition of Sir Rose, a British Treasury consultant, were laughed at by Sir Sassoon, who said it was very ridiculous. He also said that the rumors that China intends to raise foreign debt are unfounded. Even if it is true, Japan will definitely be invited to participate. Sir Sassoon believes that China does not need foreign debt to stabilize foreign exchange, but it may be needed to reorganize various debts. (29th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Talks on Rural Life <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qing Tang</p>
<h3 id="e48">Rural Population and Rural Land in Jiangning Moling <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Qiming, Jiang Jie</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: In the summer of the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935), 57 students from the College of Agriculture and the Agricultural Vocational School of Jinling University, led by the authors, conducted a rural social survey in the villages near Moling Town, Jiangning County. Moling Town is located in the southeast of the capital, 25.61 kilometers from Nanjing. The Nanjing-Jian Automotive Road runs through it, making transportation extremely convenient. The town is quite orderly. According to the Jiangning County local autonomy system, the entire town and its neighboring dependencies are divided into 22 *li* (villages). Outside the town are the four *xiang* (townships) of Xiaoling, Renling, Xinling, and Ailing, totaling 96 villages. The two-week survey completed six types of forms: rural overview, family overview, farmer life, family property division, party affiliation, and cooperative member survey. This article comes from a portion of the materials in the rural overview, including the 11 *li* within the scope of Moling Town and 78 villages in the four *xiang*. The nine *li* in the town, which are non-agricultural, were not surveyed, and the materials for the other two *li* were incomplete and not included in the statistics. All villages in the four *xiang* were originally filled out, but due to several items in the forms asking about facts from the first year of the Republic of China, the villagers were vague and unclear, with no way to answer. To ensure the accuracy of the materials, it was better to have fewer than to risk errors, so they were not included in the statistics.</p>
<p>(2) The Relationship Between Population and Land: Population is a factor in the composition of society, and land is the source of living materials. Therefore, the foundation of the entire society is built on population and land. However, the compressibility of land is relatively small, while the growth and decline of population are constantly changing. If the population tends to increase, but the area of arable land remains the same, it will inevitably lead to difficulties in people's lives, followed by various serious social problems. For example, war, epidemics, crime, etc. are all results. Consequently, social culture lags behind, and the country has no way to progress.</p>
<p>In recent decades, the population and land problems in China have attracted great attention from all sectors. However, opinions vary, and there is no consensus. In terms of population, whether the quantity is excessive or not has become the focus of debate. In terms of land, although there is a common understanding that "farms are too small," there is a dispute over whether to focus on utilization or distribution in the improvement plan. Summarizing and generalizing it, it can be seen that the imbalance between population and land in China today has become an undeniable fact. The purpose of this article is to provide some assistance to those who study this issue, based on the survey results.</p>
<p>(3) Changes in Farm Households in the Past 23 Years: Why use farm households instead of population in this survey? Because the years are relatively far apart, recalling the number of households is not only easier than recalling the number of people, but also more accurate. At the same time, the population growth and decline of each household are limited, and there will definitely not be a large difference, so it is better to use farm households as the unit. During the survey, three to six elders were selected as representatives from each village to ask about the comparison of farm households in their village between the first year of the Republic of China and the 23rd year of the Republic of China. The transition between the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China left a deeper impression on the farmers, and they had a better grasp when recalling. According to our statistics, the average number of households per village in each town and *xiang* in the 23rd year of the Republic of China ranged from 35.4 households in Renling *xiang* to 54.2 households in Xinling *xiang*, with a total average of 44.8 households per village. In Moling Town, Renling *xiang*, and part of Xiaoling *xiang*, there are more paddy fields because the Qinhuai River is available for irrigation, and land utilization has reached an extremely refined level, and the population has also reached saturation. Therefore, the average number of households per village is small. Xinling *xiang* and Ailing *xiang* are located in the northwest of Moling Town, and the terrain is undulating, with more dry land. Most of Xiaoling *xiang* also has the same situation. There is still the possibility of reclamation in the *xiang*. Although the income of farmers each year may not even be enough to pay for their own labor, it is still a way to make a living, so the number of farm households will gradually increase. However, according to Xiao Charli, a soil expert at the Beijing Geological Survey, and Xiao Boke, a geological expert, "the barren hills in the Jiangning area are not suitable for agricultural use and should only be used for forest land. Otherwise, not only will there be no profit, but excessive erosion will cause endless harm." Therefore, the future reclamation of farmland in the area is difficult to be optimistic about. Comparing the current number of households with the first year of the Republic of China, the total number of villages is 1,291 more households, with 14.5 households per village. If the total number of households in the first year of the Republic is used as the base, and the increase index of farm households in the past 23 years is calculated, it can be seen that Xiaoling, Ailing, and Xinling *xiang* have the largest increase, and Renling *xiang* has the smallest increase. If the total average of one town and four *xiang* is taken, it can be seen that the number of farm households in the past 23 years is nearly one-half more than the original number.</p>
<p>(4) Changes in Land in the Past 23 Years: Comparing the total area of cultivated land in the first year of the Republic with the 23rd year of the Republic, all *xiang* except Moling Town have increased. Moling Town is the core of the four *xiang*, and bears the various missions of connecting the economic and cultural aspects of the city and the countryside. In recent years, more buildings have been built near the town, and land has been encroached upon by road construction. At the same time, land utilization in the town is extremely refined, so there is no hope of reclaiming new land. If one more *mu* of land is used for non-agricultural purposes, the area of cultivated land will decrease by one *mu*. As for the increase index of each *xiang*, it is directly proportional to the aforementioned changes in farm households, with Xiaoyu *xiang* having the highest number and Renling *xiang* having the lowest number. As a result of the total average of one town and four *xiang*, the total area of cultivated land in the past 23 years has increased by one-eighth compared to the original number.

<p>(Nanjing) The 29th was the second day of the Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison air defense exercise. In the morning, the Air Defense Headquarters dispatched aircraft in three routes to conduct reconnaissance operations in the southeast and west of the capital. They returned one after another at noon to report the completion of the mission. Other passive air defense units were concentrated to await orders. In the afternoon, the Air Defense Headquarters received a report of enemy aircraft in Hangzhou. It dispatched aircraft to Hangzhou, encountered them en route, and engaged in a fierce battle somewhere near Taihu Lake. The enemy aircraft retreated, but several other enemy aircraft approached various places in the Nanjing garrison area. The headquarters received a report from the Suzhou monitoring post at 3:18 PM that nine enemy aircraft were attacking from Suzhou at 2:17 PM, and issued an air raid alarm at 2:20 PM. More than 10,000 people from the participating units immediately mobilized and implemented traffic control. Vehicles gradually decreased, and pedestrians entered shelters. At 3:45 PM, another emergency alarm sounded, and the situation in the streets became more tense. Traffic control teams prevented pedestrians and vehicles from passing. The headquarters issued an all-clear order at 4:20 PM when the enemy aircraft retreated. The bustling city returned to its original state. However, there were many shortcomings in the traffic control in the afternoon. Pedestrians and vehicles were not effectively prevented, which was much worse than the blackout on the evening of the 28th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The 29th was the second day of the Nanjing-Zhenjiang-Hangzhou air defense exercise. The Hangzhou side received a report at dawn that simulated enemy army units were attacking and the air force was flying to Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and other places, attempting to bomb Hangzhou. Our side immediately dispatched aircraft to intercept them and encountered them over Shaoxing. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle. At 8:50 AM, enemy aircraft flew over the city of Hangzhou and dropped bombs everywhere. Districts 5, 6, 7, and 8 were bombed, and fires broke out in many places, which were extinguished by the fire brigade. At the same time, various rescue teams and poison gas defense teams performed actions to rescue injured citizens and protect against poison gas. The all-clear signal was given at 10:00 AM when the enemy aircraft left, and traffic was restored throughout the city. At 10:30 AM, two bombers carrying 200-pound long-range bombs flew over West Lake and dropped them on the preset target in the center of the lake. More than 40,000 citizens went to the lakeside to watch. The aircraft circled once, and the huge bombs began to drop. Black smoke rose, and a loud noise occurred, shaking the entire city. The landing point was about ten meters away from the target. The second bomb also missed. Afterwards, eight more bombs were dropped before the target was destroyed. The people were amazed and deeply aware of the power of the bombs. The exercise ended at 11:00 AM. The afternoon exercise was suspended due to rain. A blackout exercise was still conducted from 8:00 PM to 9:30 PM in the evening. The 1st and 5th districts of Hangzhou conducted fire and rescue exercises from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM.

<p>Waiting for Relief in Woyang County - To the Shanghai Shen Bao Newspaper, forwarded to all charitable organizations, government agencies, legal entities, newspapers, major Chinese and foreign philanthropists, and all fathers, brothers, uncles, sisters, and aunts across the country: Woyang is a barren and impoverished county, and it has suffered from years of disasters and bandits. The people have not had a chance to recover. Although there was a half-harvest last year, the population is large and the land is small, which is not enough to provide food for the whole year. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of summer this year, drought has raged, and there has been no rain for five months. The autumn crops have all withered, and there has been no harvest at all. The second district is the most severely affected. According to the county government's investigation, the affected area is more than 100,000 mu, and the affected population is more than 143,000, accounting for almost two-thirds of the entire district. In other districts that have been less severely affected, the autumn harvest is less than 20-30%. Many middle-class families have already run out of food. The elderly and the weak are begging from door to door, and the young and strong are seeking food everywhere. The sound of crying from hunger and cold constantly echoes in our ears. There will soon be nothing left to eat in the way of grass roots and tree bark. Even more tragic is that those who have fled have nowhere to go and have recently returned home, hanging their heads and waiting for death, a sight too terrible to behold. Now that winter has arrived and the cold wind is piercing to the bone, it is foreseen that most disaster victims will either die of hunger or freeze to death. This situation is even more tragic than the floods of the 10th and 20th years of the Republic. What wrong have the people of Woyang done to deserve such misfortune? We hope that everyone will show compassion and provide generous assistance. The more, the better, but even a small amount is greatly appreciated. Every bit of relief is like a life-saving soup. If you are willing to open your purses generously, please remit the funds to the Woyang County Government for transfer to this committee, which will distribute them separately and in a timely manner, so that the disaster victims can receive practical benefits quickly, and to live up to the benevolent intentions of those with compassionate hearts. We respectfully appeal on behalf of hundreds of thousands of disaster victims awaiting rescue, with the utmost urgency. Wang Jiwu, Chairman, Ge Lianyuan, Liu Furen, Wang Jianhua, Liu Xianggu, Zhang Shanfu, Liu Yunzhi, Wang Huixuan, Wang Zhemin, Standing Committee Members of the Woyang County Early Disaster Relief Committee in Northern Anhui, respectfully kowtow with forgiveness.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Library, Wang Delin, Joins the Rebels; The Provincial Government Committee Resolves to Dismiss Wang; The Entire Educational Community of the Province Issues a Declaration Denouncing the Traitor <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Zhenjiang News: Wang Delin (style name Xiacai), Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Library, 38 years old, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang Province, was appointed to his post this summer. Recently, he suddenly left his post secretly to go to eastern Hebei to participate in the activities of the puppet Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Committee, and served as a member, concurrently as the director of both the education and construction departments. It is said that before this, Wang had written to a friend in Suzhou, saying that the situation in the north was about to change, and that someone had invited him to serve as the director of the construction department, etc. Unexpectedly, he actually joined Yin Rugeng in rebelling and harming the country. When the news spread, people from all walks of life in politics, education, military, and police here were filled with indignation. Yesterday, colleagues in the Jiangsu educational community and the teachers and staff of the Provincial Zhenjiang Teachers' School issued a declaration, unanimously denouncing him and asking the people of the country to abandon this kind of degenerate element. The provincial government, considering Wang's obvious rebellious actions, specifically brought it up at the Provincial Government Committee meeting, which resolved to dismiss him. As for the successor to the director of the Provincial Suzhou Library, the Education Department has already appointed Jiang Jinghuan to serve as the acting director. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Member of the Central Committee Issues a Statement</p>
<p>After learning of this news, the reporter immediately visited a member of the Central Committee in the province and asked for his thoughts on Wang Delin's rebellion and betrayal of the country. He was kind enough to issue the following statement, which roughly said: "In recent years, the country has been beset with difficulties, and worries and hardships have been frequent. We rely on the unity of the people across the country to overcome the difficulties together. Everyone with a sense of national pride understands this deeply. Hebei is a strategic area of paramount importance. People from all walks of life are able to persevere and maintain their position, striving to provide support. Any disturbance will affect the safety and security of the region. Especially for civil servants, they have specific duties and responsibilities, and should inspire their conscience and devote their wisdom to loyalty, working together to defend the country. However, Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Commissioner of the Luan-Yu District of Hebei Province, arbitrarily declared on the 25th of this month the establishment of the so-called Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Committee, colluding with traitors and attempting to betray the country, which is already a heinous crime and an abandonment of humanity. Unexpectedly, Wang Delin, as a high-ranking member of the educational community, was actually bewitched by him and joined the rebellion, blinded by profit and abandoned by the people of the country. We predict that the false organization of Yin and other rebels who betray the people and the country will soon be eliminated. Now, the Central National Government has issued a clear order to arrest the rebel Yin Rugeng and ordered the Hebei Provincial Government to handle it directly, quickly curbing the unrest. Wang Delin will regret it at that time," he said.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Education Community Issues a Declaration Denouncing Him</p>
<p>Since the news of Wang Delin, Director of the Provincial Suzhou Library, joining the rebellion and betraying the country spread, people from all walks of life here have been extremely indignant. The education community, in particular, believes it is unfortunate that such a degenerate element has emerged and issued a declaration denouncing him, asking the people of the country to abandon him. The declaration of the teachers and staff of the Zhenjiang Teachers' School is as follows: "The newspaper reported on November 26 that Wang Xiacai participated in the activities of the puppet Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Organization and represented the traitor Yin in external negotiations, which is clearly an act of rebellion. Wang Xiacai has served in Suzhou for many years and is currently the director of the Suzhou Library. He secretly left his post and participated in conspiracies. He is greedy for wealth and endangers the country. He is a moth in our education community. We are willing to abandon him together with the people of the country. This is our declaration."</p>
<p>Jiang Jinghuan Succeeds as Director</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department immediately selected Jiang Jinghuan, the director of the promotion department of the library, to fill the vacancy of director of the Suzhou Library. A special telegram was sent to summon Jiang to the province to receive instructions from the department and to return to the library immediately to take over and assume his duties properly. Jiang's brief resume is as follows: Jiang Jinghuan, 39 years old, a native of Wuxian County, graduated from the National Nanjing Higher Normal School. He has served as a teacher at the Suzhou Art Vocational School, an administrator at the Jiangsu Official Book Printing Office, a standing committee member of the Fourth District Local Education Research Association of the Central University, a lecturer in library science, an executive committee member of the All-Jiangsu Library Association to the China National Library Association, and the director of general affairs of this library. He has continued to hold his position for 14 years since July of the 11th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>Wang Delin's Past Teaching Positions</p>
<p>Wang Delin, style name Xiacai, 38 years old, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang Province, a Bachelor of Arts from the National Peking University, has served as the director of academic affairs at the Jiangsu Private Women's Vocational Middle School, the Jiangsu Provincial Women's Second Normal School, the provost of the Shanghai Wenzhi University, the president of the Southern University General Association, a professor at the Hubei College of Political Science and Law, the principal of the Jiangsu Provincial Huaiyin Middle School, an editor at the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, a professor at the Beiping Sino-French University, and the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Library. Now, out of greed for wealth, he secretly left his post and joined the rebellion, which is intolerable by the laws of the country, abandoned by the people of the country, and an abandonment of humanity. It is truly lamentable. (29th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Hangzhou Air Defense Drill; Military and Police on High Alert, Resembling a State of War <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: After receiving orders to prepare for the joint air defense drill in Beijing, Zhenjiang, and Hangzhou, the Hangzhou Municipality immediately instructed its various units to actively prepare and established a temporary air defense drill headquarters, with Zhou Zhirou as commander, Xuan Tiewu as deputy commander, and Jiang Jianren as chief of staff. It also set up four sections and one committee, mobilizing personnel from various agencies to plan and prepare everything. It began yesterday (the 28th). The central government specially sent Vice Chief of Staff Xiong Bin to Hangzhou to serve as the air defense supervisor and invited Huang Shaohong to serve as the chief judge. Officials from various agencies were invited to serve as judges, inspectors, and instructors. At 7:20 a.m. yesterday, a simulated enemy aircraft was spotted in the airspace over the lower reaches of the Qiantang River, flying from east to west. At 8:00 a.m., another enemy aircraft was spotted, and enemy aircraft were also spotted in Haiyan County. After receiving the report, the air defense authorities knew that multiple enemy aircraft were flying to Hangzhou to attack. They immediately dispatched machine gun teams and rescue teams to set off in different directions, and urgently notified the citizens to act in accordance with the regulations. Shops immediately ceased operations and traffic control was implemented, cutting off traffic to prevent danger. Later, it was reported that the enemy fleet had arrived in the coastal area and appeared to be attacking Hangzhou. Aircraft were dispatched to Hangzhou Bay for reconnaissance. At 8:00 a.m., the aircraft reported by radio that a simulated enemy fleet was anchored at a certain location. Defense aircraft were dispatched to bomb it, destroying an enemy aircraft carrier. At 10:40 a.m., it was learned that the enemy aircraft had no intention of attacking Hangzhou, and the alert was lifted. At 2:00 p.m., the air defense observation post reported that 11 enemy aircraft were attacking Hangzhou from Nanjing. Our side immediately dispatched a defensive flight team to intercept them. Traffic control was re-implemented in the urban area, shops immediately closed their doors, and pedestrians were advised by the police to enter shelters for refuge. All kinds of vehicles retreated into secluded streets and alleys. The bustling commercial areas were as quiet as late at night, as if they had fallen into a state of war. At 2:15 p.m., when our fighter planes flew to the airspace over Haining, they encountered enemy aircraft and engaged in fierce combat. At that time, six enemy aircraft, divided into two teams, attempted to invade Jianqiao along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, but due to the strict defense of our army, they changed direction and attacked Hangzhou. Our side immediately issued an emergency alarm and immediately dispatched aircraft to release smoke screens, covering various important transportation agencies and obscuring the enemy aircraft's targets. Flight teams were also dispatched to intercept them. Six enemy aircraft, divided into two teams in a character formation, four fighters and two bombers, flew in the city's airspace and dropped dozens of incendiary bombs, poison gas bombs, and bombs on our city railway station, Zhakou, Genshanmen, Gongchenqiao, Wulinmen, Security Office, telephone bureau, etc. A section of civilian housing in Meidong Gaoqiao near the city station caught fire. At 3:37 p.m., it was reported that the Zhakou Railway Factory was also bombed and caught fire. The nearby provincial defense team and Yilong rushed to put out the fire. Four men and women on the upper floors of a civilian house at the railway station were unable to escape. Two were rescued by the fire brigade with ladders, and two jumped out of the window, suffering minor injuries. They were taken to a temporary hospital for treatment by the rescue team. The remaining fire was also extinguished. Some of the onlookers were injured by poison gas and were also rescued by students from the Zhejiang Medical College, who were part of the rescue team. The performance was realistic and the results were excellent. Other damaged railway tracks, telephone lines, and water pipes were immediately repaired by the engineering team. At the same time, many reactionary elements who took the opportunity to cause trouble were captured and handed over to the military authorities for interrogation. The blackout, which began at 8:00 p.m., plunged the entire city into darkness. The military and police were on high alert, as if facing a formidable enemy. At around 9:00 p.m., the street lamp wire on Yingchai Road suddenly short-circuited, creating a dangerous situation, but it was calmly extinguished, fortunately without causing any disaster. However, due to the drizzling rain, the performance of dropping illuminating parachutes could not be held. The entire city was restored to light at 9:30 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Chen Zhongbi Arrives in Shanghai to Negotiate Guangdong Provincial Construction Bonds; Pledge of 3 Million Yuan... Obtains Agreement from Three Banks <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The 5 million yuan Guangdong Provincial Construction Bonds of the 24th year of the Republic, passed by the Legislative Yuan, will be issued tomorrow (the 1st). Lin Yunhai, Chairman of Guangdong Province, has been discussing borrowing cash with banking circles in Shanghai and there are already signs of progress. He telegraphed Chen Zhongbi, President of the Guangzhou Municipal Bank, to come to Shanghai for detailed discussions. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Chen, who stated that he had already obtained the agreement of the Central Bank and other banks. The following is a record of his conversation:</p>
<p>Key Points of the Bond Regulations</p>
<p>The Guangdong Construction Bonds amount to 5 million yuan and are being issued with the assistance of the Central Government. The regulations were passed by the Legislative Yuan six months ago. The issuance date is December 1st, but due to procedural delays, it may be postponed to January of next year. The term of the bonds is set at five years, with full repayment by the end of November (or December) of the 29th year of the Republic. The principal and interest will be paid twice a year, at the end of May and November. The collateral for the bonds is all the assets of the province's [unclear] factory. The factory's total revenue last year was 2 million yuan, and it is expected to increase to 3 million yuan after full operation.</p>
<p>Mortgage Agreement Obtained</p>
<p>The bond certificates are currently being printed by the Commercial Press in Shanghai and will soon be completed. It is planned to mortgage 3 million yuan to the banking circles in Shanghai. Lin Yunhai has already discussed this with the banking circles in Shanghai and there are signs of progress. I (Chen Zhongbi said himself) took a flight here yesterday (the 28th) for detailed discussions. This morning (i.e., yesterday morning), I visited Vice President Chen Xing of the Central Bank, Manager Bei Songsun of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, and General Manager Tang Shoumin of the Bank of Communications. I have obtained their agreement and will have further discussions soon.</p>
<p>Designated Use of Bond Funds</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen, the use of the bond funds is designated as part of the working capital for various factories run by the province. The factories that are currently in operation or being established include five sugar factories and one textile factory. The textile factory is divided into five parts: silk weaving, cotton weaving, hemp weaving, spinning, and silk fabric products. Its scale is very large. Other factories include a paper mill, a sulfuric acid plant, a cement plant, a fertilizer plant, a beverage plant, and a caustic soda plant, totaling six plants.</p>
<p>Striving for Thrift and Construction</p>
<p>Mr. Chen continued that the capital needed to establish the above-mentioned factories is more than 30 million yuan. Although the burden on the people of Guangdong Province is heavy, the government is also working hard to be thrifty. Therefore, the above-mentioned factories have been able to achieve success in a short period of two and a half years. There are also steel mills and hydropower plants currently under planning and construction. The former is estimated to require 32 million yuan, and the latter requires 38 million yuan, totaling 70 million yuan. Efforts will be made to tighten government expenses to engage in construction, he said.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Guangdong Province Succeeds in Sugar Cane Farmers' Loan, Totaling 1.4 Million Yuan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Feng Rui, Director of the Guangdong Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, and Zou Bingwen, Vice President of the Shanghai Bank, and Shen Shuyu, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, have successfully negotiated a loan for sugar cane farmers, totaling 1.4 million yuan. The Shanghai Bank and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will each be responsible for half, with a term of one year and a monthly interest rate of eight percent. Panyu and Shunde counties are designated as the loan areas, and the loan is limited to fertilizer and sugar cane seeds. All the measures have been agreed upon, and Director Feng has returned to Guangdong from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Signing the Contract</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will meet today to discuss the loan measures. It is reported that the original plan was for sugar cane farmers in Panyu and Shunde counties to organize sugar cane farmers' purchasing cooperatives, lend the funds to the cooperatives, and then distribute them to the farmers. Now, it is proposed to change the method and lend the funds directly to the sugar cane farmers, guaranteed by the Guangdong Provincial Government, because the sugar cane farmers in the area are very reliable. As for the loan contract, it will be telegraphed to Guangdong after today's meeting, and then formally signed by the Shanghai Bank branch and the Postal Savings and Remittance branch in Guangdong and the Guangdong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Loan Date</p>
<p>Guangdong farmers plant sugar cane once a year, with the planting period around January and the harvest period around December. The loan date after the success of this loan will be from New Year's Day in the 25th year of the Republic until the farmers return the loan after the harvest. As for the 700,000 yuan loan that the Shanghai Bank independently lent to the sugar cane farmers in Panyu County at the end of last year, it has been decided that the borrowing farmers will directly return the loan to the bank starting in December.</p>

Chairman Yu Zuoting delivered a welcoming speech, and Chairman Lin responded with a speech. Mayor Liu and others also delivered speeches. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Yu Zuoting said in his welcoming speech: "Chairman Lin of the Guangdong Provincial Government recently passed through Shanghai after attending the National Congress of Representatives. The business community of this city is able to admire his grace, which is a rare opportunity. Guangzhou and Shanghai are both the earliest commercial ports opened in our country, and Guangdong Province's new industry has flourished in recent years, increasing its close relationship with Shanghai. It allows each other to communicate and make up for each other's shortcomings in commerce. It is a new trend in the development of Shanghai-Guangdong commerce that is worthy of attention. Therefore, our Chamber represents the city's industrial and commercial circles at this time, with a simple wine, inviting you to stop by. It is to express our long-cherished admiration and give each other an opportunity to talk. We are fortunate to have you visit. In recent years, the central government has been determined to carry out construction, and Guangdong Province is one of the most diligent provinces in its implementation. As far as what is known to the people of Shanghai in recent years, such as sugar manufacturing, its products are sold in large quantities in Shanghai in addition to the province's own supply, which is enough to block some loopholes. This is a very gratifying thing in the call to revitalize domestic products. As the saying goes, the auxiliary cart depends on each other. In a country, it is like a family, and it is better to maintain each other. For example, if the products of Guangdong's sugar factories are only sold in this province, and no efforts are made to promote sales in other provinces and cities, its development will be limited. Also, regarding sugar cane planting loans, the financial circles in Shanghai also understand deeply that this move has a great relationship with the revitalization of domestic products, and they have wholeheartedly accepted it. In view of the above two things, the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai have a common feeling today, that is, "From the production perspective, we can take each province's needs and strengths as a unit. From the sales perspective, from the tax perspective, we should take the entire territory as an economic unit, and it is not appropriate to divide the boundaries." The transit tariffs that our country has always set up, where the native products of this province are transported to another province, the customs must collect transit taxes, which is the most obstructive to the development of domestic products and does not conform to the tariff system of various countries. Therefore, the central government has resolutely decided to abolish it in the near future. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly expressed this, and the National Government issued an explicit order several years ago to abolish the likin of the provinces, also in order to implement this policy. Today, there should be no more commodity taxes collected between provinces, and the meaning is clear. A few years ago, Guangdong Province had a proposal to collect protective taxes on goods from outside the province, which was exempted after the sincere request of the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai, which proves that the Chamber's above-mentioned contributions have been understood by the authorities and officials in Guangdong, for which we would like to express our sincere gratitude at this gathering today. In recent years, the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai have declined sharply, and the reason is that after the fall of the four northeastern provinces, North China has also experienced fluctuations, so the sales in the two places have been completely cut off, and one has been greatly reduced, resulting in today's incurable disease. Therefore, today's domestic market has been limited to the Yangtze River Basin and the Pearl River Basin. The Pearl River Basin, with its agricultural product taxes, miscellaneous taxes, and special taxes on reformed products from outside the province, which have been successively implemented after repeated appeals but have not been exempted, is also trapped in the difficulty of sales, with the risk of discounts and losses. Today, Shanghai merchants are in a four-sided predicament, and they have great expectations for your efforts to mediate. We look up to you as a guiding light, and we would like to take this opportunity to express our sincerity and offer our humble suggestions. If you are willing to adopt them, how fortunate we would be!"</p>
<p>Lin's Reply</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Yunhai of Guangdong Province replied, roughly saying: "I am very grateful for the warm reception from your Chamber during this trip to Shanghai. I am also very grateful for the sincere help of the members of your Chamber. Shanghai is the first commercial port in our country and the center of commerce in the country. It has been affected by the unprosperous atmosphere in recent years, so that it is not as good as before, but as long as the people and the government work together, there is hope for recovery and prosperity. Our country has a vast territory and a large population, and is rich in products. We should find ways to develop railways, highways, and water conservancy to facilitate transportation, so that the agricultural products of the countryside and the industrial products of the city can be exchanged with each other. For example, the raw materials and supplies for industry used to rely on foreign imports. In the future, we should use our country's agricultural raw materials to imitate foreign products to develop industry. At the same time, agriculture, industry, and mining should support each other and work hard. We should also develop our country's local sales, and there will inevitably be great results in the future. Although we are in this period of depression, we should not be discouraged, but continue to work hard to develop. I wish you all success."</p>
<p>Liu's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Liu Jiwen of Guangzhou said in his speech: "Shanghai's commercial center is on the surface, and the city's commercial offices are all-encompassing and the best in the country. The Guangdong Chamber of Commerce is incomplete, so there is no connection with other places. In the future, chambers of commerce in various places should be connected with each other. For example, Japanese commercial liaisons in various markets in China, such as Shanghai, Hankou, Yichang, and Guangdong, have statistics on sales. If place B lacks goods, they will telegraph place A to supply them, and the adjustment is proper, which has taken away our market. There is no organization in our country, and we have lost contact, which has led to failure. Therefore, we should unite and connect and collect statistics in order to have a way. In view of this, Guangdong welcomes Shanghai business people to transport goods to Guangdong, and Guangdong transports goods to Shanghai. We will earnestly connect with each other to promote sales, and strive to win back the markets that have been taken away by foreigners." The gathering ended in joy at around 10:00 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Optimistic Promotion of National Goods Overseas: A Large Batch of National Goods Was Shipped the Day Before Yesterday; National Goods Industry to Form Company for Promotion <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the shipment of national goods for overseas promotion, strongly advocated by various sectors, has gradually developed. Overseas Chinese in the Nanyang region are particularly enthusiastic about purchasing and using national goods. Therefore, a large number of national goods are shipped to various ports in Nanyang. National goods manufacturers, seeing the potential for profit, are competing to promote their products. The day before yesterday, when the Dollar Steamship Company's President Jackson sailed from Shanghai to Nanyang, it carried a large batch of national goods to fulfill orders from local overseas Chinese merchants. It is reported that merchants in the national goods industry in Shanghai are planning to raise substantial funds to form a company to promote national goods overseas.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Two Trade Associations Jointly Send Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Urging Implementation of Commercial Acceptance Drafts; Support for Mr. Luo Qinghua's Three Proposals; Request for Representatives to Expedite Rediscounting <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>After the Municipal Chamber of Commerce initiated the implementation of commercial acceptance drafts to improve the account sales system and increase payment instruments, various industries began to promote it in response to the ability of these drafts to improve the current credit system. However, the rediscounting system was not yet complete, hindering the full realization of its benefits. At a time when the government is implementing monetary system reforms, various industries are eager to actively promote these drafts to aid the government's industrial recovery. Previously, Mr. Luo Qinghua sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce proposing: (1) request the Central Bank to promptly formulate rediscounting measures in accordance with laws and regulations and handle rediscounting business; (2) request the banking and money industries associations to strongly support the promotion of acceptance drafts, and first handle acceptance and rediscounting business for the recognized small-amount loan fund; (3) request the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee to list and disclose the names and amounts of small-amount loan banks and businesses that have pledged contributions and distribute them to various industry associations. Yesterday, the paper, dyeing and weaving, rubber, electrical machinery and silk weaving, knitting, electrical appliance, glass, biscuit and confectionery, silk and satin printing, canning, cotton cloth, and other trade associations jointly sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce supporting Mr. Luo's proposals and requesting the dispatch of representatives to expedite rediscounting to facilitate circulation. The original letter from the various industry associations is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from Paper Industry, etc.</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, Since the outflow of silver from Shanghai last year, credit has tightened, industry and commerce have been in distress, and economic panic has prevailed, the severity of the situation is unprecedented. Your esteemed association has led merchants and gathered experts to jointly study and devise remedial measures. As a result, Mr. Luo Qinghua's proposal for the promotion of commercial acceptance drafts was adopted. The associations, recognizing that the current economic tsunami cannot be contained in a short period, and that the stagnation of account receivables in various industries needs to be improved, feel that commercial acceptance drafts are more flexible and convertible than the account sales system. On the one hand, they can increase payment instruments. Therefore, the associations have followed your esteemed association in unanimously promoting them. Unfortunately, the assistance from various parties is limited by their strength, resulting in the failure to fully realize the benefits of the promotion. Several weeks ago, your esteemed association sent a letter to the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee, proposing to allocate three million yuan from the small-amount loans pledged by banks and businesses as an acceptance rediscounting fund, and the Loan Committee has accepted your esteemed association's proposal and decided to proceed accordingly. We believe that with the fund in place, implementation can proceed without worry. We hope that the financial industry can follow this lead and promote it together, and that the Central Bank will handle rediscounting in accordance with the law, so that payment instruments can be increased and industry and commerce can have hope of recovery. However, a long time has passed and it has not been implemented. Industry and commerce are eagerly waiting, like waiting for the new year. The three points mentioned in Mr. Luo Qinghua's letter to your esteemed association reported the other day are what the associations wanted to say and are indeed essential for rescuing industry and commerce and promoting recovery. As for the request for the Central Bank to handle rediscounting, we have heard that your esteemed association plans to dispatch representatives, together with the chairmen of the banking and money industries associations, to request the financial authorities to order its implementation. However, many days have passed, the end of the year is approaching, and industry and commerce are in greater need of assistance than in the past. The circulation of bills is still a pie in the sky. Therefore, the associations, in addition to unanimously supporting Mr. Luo Qinghua's three proposals, also request your esteemed association to check the previous proposal, dispatch representatives, and request the Central Bank to quickly formulate rediscounting measures to facilitate circulation and maintain industry. We are eagerly awaiting your instructions. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Letter from Cotton Cloth Industry</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, We believe that to promote the recovery of industry and commerce, it is necessary to increase credit instruments first. The implementation of acceptance bills has been the unanimous desire of various industries and is recognized worldwide. Unfortunately, although the banking industry and the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee had previously planned to implement acceptance bills, they have not been implemented to date. The commercial acceptance drafts promoted by various associations have not achieved significant results due to the failure to resolve the rediscounting issue. Therefore, although we advocate relief day and night, the lack of instruments remains the same, and the decline of the market remains the same. Now, fortunately, the government is implementing a currency management policy, and the Central, China, and Communications Banks have formed a unified entity. Financial institutions are becoming increasingly consolidated. The issue of rediscounting should no longer be a concern. If we can take this opportunity to promote acceptance bills to increase credit instruments, it will undoubtedly benefit the recovery of industry and commerce. Our association, witnessing the current difficulties, cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are sending this special letter, respectfully hoping that your esteemed association will present it to the Ministry of Finance as soon as possible, forwarding it to the Central Bank, and promptly formulate rediscounting measures in accordance with the law and handle rediscounting business. One hundred, please also send separate letters to the banking and money industries associations and the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee, urging them to handle bank acceptance bills to replace mortgage loans and promote commercial acceptance drafts to replace credit loans, in order to save the critical situation and benefit industry and commerce. We eagerly await your instructions with the utmost anticipation. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Director Cai Explains Improvement of Real Estate Mortgage Issues <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-based North China Daily News recently commented on the "Shanghai Real Estate Mortgage Improvement Issues" proposed by Director Cai Zengji of the Land Bureau. Yesterday, Director Cai published an explanation of the issues in the newspaper, which is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Necessity of Improving Mortgaged Real Estate</p>
<p>Shanghai's land issues have special and distorted characteristics. To resolve the proposed land reform, it is necessary to briefly describe the complexity and shortcomings of the current land system so that society can understand the necessity of improving the current mortgaged real estate system.</p>
<p>弊弊 in Tao Deed Registration Procedures</p>
<p>Even the most common Tao deeds are not immune to malpractices. A Tao deed is a lease registered in the name of a foreigner at the consulate. Although the registered owner of this type of land is a foreigner, most of them are acting as trustees on behalf of the original owner. The original owner is then granted a Tao deed and a trust deed by the registered owner. This system is unique to China and is not found elsewhere. In land transfers, registered owners have been known to take the opportunity to exchange for new deeds and give them to another new owner without the original owner's knowledge. When disputes arise, the court often rules that the property belongs to the original owner, and the new owner is a person who has violated land rights.</p>
<p>Cunning People Often Use Substitute Mortgages</p>
<p>In addition, there are also registered owners who often do not know the address of the original owner and cannot communicate with them, and have to bear various taxes on their behalf. Therefore, the relationship between the registered owner and the original owner is unsatisfactory. In addition, registered owners often do not have complete records of the original owner's credentials. For example, the original owner only stamps a seal and considers it a receipt, without signing it in addition to the seal. If the person is illiterate, they do not add a fingerprint as proof. Due to these incomplete records and the general public's lack of understanding of the legal procedures and customs of real estate, cunning people often use illegal methods to obtain the legal owner's land deed, trust deed, and even seal to implement a mortgage. The lender, in good faith, is unaware of the situation and believes that the mortgage is legal. However, the loan is actually given to a person who has stolen the deed, and there is no legal protection.</p>
<p>Only Registration Can Protect Rights</p>
<p>In summary, due to the complex issues and shortcomings of land, it is known that land mortgages cannot provide legal protection to the mortgagee and mortgagor without registration with the Land Bureau. When land is registered, the Land Bureau carefully considers the land deed and property rights. If the land deed is approved for registration, it proves that the owner is the legal owner. When the lender mortgages the loan, they also know that the person they are transacting with is the legal owner. Even if cunning people want to exploit the situation, they will find it difficult. Therefore, mortgage registration is a necessary procedure to protect the rights of the people.</p>
<p>Fair Handling Depends on the Courts</p>
<p>As for the fair protection of the interests of both the mortgagor and the mortgagee, the local court should be the organ for handling such lawsuits. Regarding this point, a world-renowned financier also expressed dissent and stated that "if appeals can be executed in the court, it is not without obstacles to issuing the suggestion." However, given the special circumstances of land in Shanghai, there is no sufficient reason to directly abolish court appeals. However, if the registration system can be implemented, the current shortcomings and malpractices will naturally be eliminated, and although appeals cannot be completely eliminated, they should be reduced. According to the Land Law, before the establishment of a land court, the local court will only temporarily handle special mortgage cases that cannot be cleared by administrative power through registration.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Auction Rules</p>
<p>As for the rule that requires the mortgagee to provide security before conducting a public auction, it only applies to protect the rights of the legal owner when the above-mentioned disputes occur. However, in practice, it is not lightly cited unless the Director of the Land Bureau determines that the mortgagee has sufficient legal evidence to win the case.</p>
<p>Torrens System Can Be Adopted</p>
<p>The Torrens system is the most complete land system. However, even in this system, it is unavoidable to rely on the protection of the court to enforce mortgage rights. According to the current Torrens system in the United States, all transfers, such as mortgages and leases, must be recorded in the land certificate. All deeds are guaranteed by the government, and any transfer of property must be certified by a person designated by the government. As for mortgaged property, most of it is prepared by a lawyer on behalf of the mortgagee, and the mortgagor signs and acknowledges the fulfillment of the conditions proposed by the mortgagee before a notary public. If the mortgagor fails to fulfill the conditions, the mortgagee will take legal action to enforce the mortgage and may apply to the land court for enforcement. After the legally stipulated period expires, usually about thirty days, it will be auctioned off. This simple system is commendable and can be used as a reference for reforming the land system.</p>
<p>Welcome Suggestions and Proposals from All Sectors</p>
<p>The situation of the land system in Shanghai needs to be studied from all aspects. Fundamental reform cannot be achieved without the joint assistance and planning of all relevant groups, such as the Real Estate Association, real estate companies, consulate registration departments, the press, the legal profession, the banking industry, and various experts. All suggestions related to solving land problems are welcome, and it is hoped that society will correct its shortcomings.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, after an examination by doctors Niu Huilin, Niu Huisheng, and Noel, it was deemed necessary to remove the bullet from President Wang's back. At about 10:00 AM yesterday, the doctors gathered at Wang's residence, and at 11:30 AM, they began the surgery. Doctors Niu Huilin and Niu Huisheng performed the incision, and Doctor Noel monitored the pulse and physical health. After the incision, it was discovered that the bullet was tightly lodged between the ribs, making it difficult to remove. After an hour and a half, the bullet was finally removed from the ribs, but it was still in the muscle and had not been removed. Because too much time had passed, President Wang's physical strength gradually weakened, so the doctors decided to temporarily suspend the surgery and plan to continue the surgery after resting for a few days and regaining some strength. According to the doctors, now that the bullet has been removed from the ribs, the next removal will be easier.</p>

<p>Mr. Weng Jinbao, an overseas Chinese from Sumatra, came to Shanghai yesterday and went to national goods organizations to request introductions to national goods, in order to carry them abroad for promotion. The Federation of National Goods Factories specially notified its members: Respected Sirs, Mr. Weng Jinbao, an overseas Chinese merchant from Sumatra, was introduced by Consul General Song and guided by Mr. Ni Guangxun of the travel department of the China Travel Service to visit the showroom and request an introduction to your factory, preparing to procure domestically produced products to promote them in Sumatra. Since eastern goods are sold there, the overseas Chinese merchant is keen to return to China to investigate national goods, and Consul General Song is working hard to promote them abroad. This is a good opportunity to develop national goods trade. Correspondingly, we are sending this letter of introduction, requesting your factory to check and provide a warm reception and explain the production situation so that he can understand it. We are anxiously awaiting your response.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Federation of National Goods Factories has sent a letter to the China Merchants Electric Company, requesting a reduction in electricity charges to provide relief due to the economic downturn. The original letter stated: Respected Sirs, Regarding the case of various national goods factories in the South City requesting a reduction in electricity charges to provide relief due to the impact of the economic recession, your esteemed company replied on June 28 of this year that the current discount method of your esteemed company is not yet perfect and may adopt a grading system. The revised feeding business regulations were submitted to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau a month ago and forwarded to the Municipal Government for approval. As soon as the approval is returned, it will be announced and implemented on a scheduled basis, etc. Upon receiving this, we immediately submitted two requests to the Shanghai Municipal Government on June 29 and July 30 of this year to approve and announce your esteemed company's revised electricity business regulations. To date, no reply has been received. Subsequently, in September of this year, the All-China National Products Promotion League and the Citizen National Products Promotion Association successively negotiated to urge the matter, but no reply has been received. A reduction in electricity charges will reduce the production costs of national goods in various factories, and the expansion of huge sales is foreseeable. The prosperity of inland factories will increase, and the increase in power supply can be predicted. Although it may be a loss in the east, it will be enough to reap benefits in the west. This case has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and announcement for more than half a year. We do not know whether your esteemed company has received the approval. If it has not been received, please urge the Municipal Government to quickly approve and announce it to comfort the hopes of the user factories. We are anxiously awaiting your response.</p>

<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a fast mail telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday: To the Shanghai National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Regarding the case where the Chamber of Commerce supported a telegram stating that the Shun Chang County Business Tax Bureau was collecting soil cloth tax and paper tax in violation of the law, which was submitted to the Ministry, the Fujian Provincial Government was consulted and ordered to strictly correct it, and instructions were issued in each case. Now, the Fujian Provincial Government's Ministry of Finance's No. 3948 of November 7, 1935, replies, stating briefly that the Shanghai Special Zone Chamber of Commerce had previously submitted a report, and the Shun Chang County Magistrate had been ordered to investigate and abolish it.

<h3 id="e106">Date for Changing Account Books and Affixing Stamps Is Established; National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram Requesting Maintenance <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce separately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday: To the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, Recently, a telegram from the Beijing Municipal Chamber of Commerce opened, stating that Article 10 of the Implementation Rules of the Stamp Tax Law stipulates that all temporary examples of stamp tax and separate regulations of various provinces, as well as all established cases approved by the Ministry of Finance in the past to exempt, postpone, or reduce stamp tax, shall be abolished. It is not clearly stipulated whether the established case that has been implemented for many years of changing new account books and affixing new stamps during the period from February 1st to 15th is also included in the abolition. This association is particularly panicked because merchants are accustomed to changing new account books after February 1st. If it is suddenly changed to January 1st, there will be many difficulties in practice. We should understand the actual situation and allow the national order to apply to the period from March 1st to 15th for the replacement of account books and the affixing of new stamps, except for those that apply to the accounting year. We earnestly request that your esteemed association immediately submit a flying report and unanimously appeal for the rapid issuance of orders and forward them to the judicial organs for investigation to avoid accidents. Please approve and order compliance, and forward them to the Legislative and Judicial Yuans to order compliance to avoid disputes. We pray that the Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, will solemnly print.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Foreign Monk Sues Russian Newspaper: Continued Trial, Court Advises Reconciliation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Buddhist foreign monk Zhao Kong Seng sued the Russian-language "Chai La Wan Bao" at No. 77 Xiafei Road because the newspaper published an article on August 3rd of this year about Trebich Lincoln (translated sound, Zhao Kong's original name) inciting the situation in the Far East, supplying Abyssinia with weapons, and serving as a military detective. After Zhao Kong read it, he believed that the newspaper published the article and spread the words without reason, defaming him. He specifically hired Russian lawyer Yin Shengmin as his agent and submitted a lawsuit to the Second Special Court's Criminal Court, accusing the publisher of Chai La Wan Bao, Lin Biqi, and the editor, Weis, of violating Article 31 of the Criminal Law (defamation) and requesting an investigation. He also filed a civil lawsuit to recover 10,000 yuan in damages. The case had been summoned once, but the parties involved did not arrive, and the court ordered a rescheduling. This newspaper reported the details. Yesterday, the plaintiff and two French disciples, as well as the entrusted agents Lin Yingqing and Yin Shengmin, arrived in court. The defendants also arrived with their defense lawyer Jiang Guofang. At 10:20 AM, Judge Sun Penghang continued to hear the case in the Criminal Court. First, the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Yin Shengmin, stated in court that many newspapers had published that the plaintiff was a "strange talent," and requested the court to order reporters not to use the word "strange" again. The judge ruled that the court had no right to interfere with the freedom of speech of newspapers. If the plaintiff believed it was defamation, he could file a lawsuit. The court then questioned both parties' age, origin, occupation, and address. The plaintiff spoke French and translated his testimony. He was 57 years old, Hungarian, stateless, and lived at No. 12 Gongguan Road. His original name was Trebich Lincoln. The defendants spoke in Russian. Lin Biqi stated that he was 34 years old, a White Russian, and the publisher of Chai La Wan Bao, living at No. 403 Yarbei Road. Weis stated that he was 35 years old, a White Russian, and the chief writer of Chai La Wan Bao, living at No. 764 Pushi Road. At this point, the judge ordered the plaintiff to state the purpose of the lawsuit. He claimed that he requested the court to uphold justice and the protection of the law. Chai La Wan Bao published news that I was selling weapons, which damaged my reputation. But since I was born, I have never done such a thing, it's all rumors. The rest of the words are stated by my agent lawyer. Questioned the defendant Lin Bishi, I am the publisher of Chai La newspaper, the words recorded on the newspaper are all managed by the chief writer. Weis said that the words published in the newspaper were my responsibility for the description of the plaintiff Lincoln, transferred from the Latvia Today newspaper (according to the early newspaper) reprint, the original text is also in Russian, published as it is, followed by a few sentences, the officer asked The Latvia Today newspaper presented today only has empty frames and titles, where is the original text? Why didn't you indicate that it was a reprint? Wei Gong's newspaper clippings were burned after two months of storage because there was no place to store them, so it is not necessary to explain where the news came from. It has been stated that it came from European newspapers, the officer then ordered that the case could be rescheduled, and the original newspaper must be produced as evidence. The current publication is not enough to prove it. I hope the defendant can find a way to prove it. The defendant's lawyer rose up and said that the defendant has written to Harbin to find this newspaper, but I am afraid that it will be difficult to do it after a long time. The plaintiff's means are very spicy, and the defendant wants to buy a story self-described by modern spies published by the British Holysheng Bookstore, which the plaintiff admits to be a spy, and it is impossible to buy this book in the store. After thinking of various methods, I just bought it. The defendant published various things about the plaintiff in many European newspapers and the Shanghai Times, such as being arrested. The news was not reprinted, which is enough to prove that Po Gao had no malice, and according to the publication law, he can write a letter to correct it, etc. The court then advised both parties that this case is a crime of accusation, and reconciliation can be carried out during the political period. He then ordered a retrial to be scheduled, and announced the adjournment.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Rickshaw Trade Association Opposes Vehicle Committee's Arbitrary Fines <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Trade Association recently reported that rickshaw pullers reported that the vehicle committee's vehicle owners had overcharged rickshaw rentals, and the vehicle committee arbitrarily fined and detained licenses. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the vehicle committee, requesting leniency. The original letter said: "Dear Sirs, we have recently received letters from vehicle owners Yu Hengzu, Wang Shengji, Lu Jingchang, Cai Hengxing, Jiang Caichen, Chen Wusheng, Zhang Tongxing, Zhong Kuanzha, Li Yousheng, Lu Genquan, Lu Xieikun, Zhou Zhiyun, Fang Dengfu, Liji, etc. The general idea is that the Public Works Department's vehicle committee, based on the rickshaw pullers' untruthful reports, accused them of overcharging rickshaw rentals, and fined them as much as 4 to 10 yuan per vehicle or detained their licenses for 7 days to 1 month, regardless of whether it is true or false, there must be a subpoena to those that are accused, there must be a fine to those that are summoned. At this time when vehicles are gradually being replaced and vehicle materials are becoming more and more expensive, the losses and hardships of vehicle owners are already unbearable. If they are fined innocently again, they will inevitably be on the verge of desperation. Please send representatives to negotiate on behalf of them, so as to avoid oppression, etc. According to this, the rickshaw rental fee, together with the mutual aid association fee collected on behalf, was originally set at 8 jiao and 5 fen of silver dollars per day. Later, because the rickshaw pullers did not have silver dollars to pay the rent, it was changed to 12 jiao of small silver coins per day, which was a fact. Since the promulgation of our country's new currency system, the letter from your association has been received, stating that 8 jiao and 5 fen of silver dollars should still be charged per day. We immediately notified all vehicle owners to follow the rules consistently. Unexpectedly, a few rickshaw pullers suddenly reported that the vehicle owners had overcharged rickshaw rentals, resulting in repeated fines. However, the vehicle owners all denied it, causing many disputes. We believe that these matters, whether true or not, should be handled leniently by your association first to avoid fines. In the future, we will definitely abide by the agreed rental fee consistently, without any deviation. Therefore, we are writing this letter to request your association to allow the withdrawal of all the orders for fines or license detentions for the rickshaw pullers' reports of overcharging rickshaw rentals, in order to show leniency and avoid disturbances. This is what we earnestly pray for."</p>

<p>Sun Shiyu, who resided at No. 38 Taiping Lane, Suzhou, had a fixed deposit of 10,000 yuan in the Mainland Bank on Jiuzhou Road in Shanghai. Recently, Sun went to Dongtai County in Jiangbei for business. His wife and niece, Ma Yuying, were at home. On the 3rd of this month, Sun's friends, Zhou Wenkui and Jing Riru, employees of the Commercial Bank of China's branch on Aidoa Road in Shanghai, suddenly arrived at Sun's residence in Suzhou. They told Sun's wife that there was news of instability at the Mainland Bank. Knowing that Sun had a deposit there, they came specifically to inform her. However, the deposit was fixed-term and could not be withdrawn immediately. The only option was to pledge the deposit slip to the bank for a loan. Sun's wife believed it was true and, after obtaining her husband's consent via long-distance telephone, sent her niece, Ma Yuying, to Shanghai with Zhou and Jing. On the 6th, they pledged the deposit slip to the Mainland Bank and obtained 9,000 yuan in legal tender. In addition to Jing Riru acting as a witness, Zhou Wenkui also persuaded Wu Yaqin, the manager of the Commercial Bank of China's Nanshi branch, to guarantee the pledge. After the pledge was made, Zhou immediately suggested that the 9,000 yuan be deposited into the Bank of China's Hongkou branch under the name of Sun Shiyu. He then sent the deposit book to Sun's home. Later, Sun's wife received a phone call from her husband, instructing her to withdraw the money. Sun's wife then wrote a check, entrusting Zhou and others to withdraw the money and remit it to Suzhou. However, Zhou disappeared without a trace. On the 16th, Sun suddenly received a letter from Zhou from Ningbo, stating that the money had been used to smuggle silver dollars to Dalian, but the matter was exposed midway, so he could only slowly find a way to return it. After receiving the letter, Sun rushed to Shanghai and inquired at the Bank of China's Hongkou branch. He learned that 8,960 yuan had been withdrawn from the 9,000 yuan, leaving only 38 yuan and 2 jiao. After careful consideration, Sun felt that Zhou and Jing were highly suspicious and had engaged in a joint fraudulent act. He arrested Jing and handed him over to the General Police Station the day before yesterday. After investigation by Chinese detective Yang Peisheng, Jing was detained, and a search for Zhou Wenkui was launched, but he had already fled without a trace. Yesterday morning, Jing Riru was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation, stating that Jing was highly suspected and requested permission to detain him for detailed investigation. Then, Ma Yuying recounted the details of the pledge. Judge Huang Risheng asked Jing about his age and origin. He stated that he was 26 years old, from Shaoxing, and resided at No. 3, Fudeli, Chengdu Road, working as an employee at the Commercial Bank of China. Judge Huang Risheng then questioned</p>
<p>the actual situation, and then ordered that Jing Riru should be allowed to be detained.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiong Huiping and Clerk Tao Zongkan came to the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the Police Department, explained the case and stated that, except for Zhang Dehui, who was not prosecuted due to lack of evidence, the others were prosecuted according to Article 257 of the Criminal Law, and requested a trial according to the law. Then, Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, and the detectives filed a case, requesting permission to transfer Yuan Hongsheng, Wang Tugen, and Zhang Dehui back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The court verified the report and then ordered the suspects to be interrogated separately. Yuan Hongsheng confessed to selling drugs in the concession and requested to be tried here, and did not want to be transferred. Wang Tugen confessed that he occasionally smoked opium because of illness and that he lived in the back parlor and was detained and had nothing to do with Yuan. Zhang Dehui confessed that he was in the kiln business and temporarily lived with his relative Yuan Hongsheng because he stopped working, and did not sell red pills with him. Cao Wangshi confessed that her husband used to sell morphine, but she did not sell it herself. Wang Xiuying confessed that the red pills were placed with her by a young sister to sell. The other suspects all denied their guilt. After verifying the confessions and after debate, the court announced the adjournment and scheduled the verdict for 2:00 p.m. on the 30th (today). The suspects were returned to custody. The seized opium pills, morphine, equipment, etc., were sent to the stolen goods warehouse.</p>

Suspect Ye is Wanted by Zhejiang Provincial Government for Other Cases <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Xida Xing Transportation Company at the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway South Station in this city, on the 23rd of this month at approximately 5:00 PM, received six sacks filled with goods from Wang Changgen, a Hangzhou resident. Wang claimed the sacks contained medicinal herbs destined for Lanxi, Zhejiang. However, suspicion arose when Wang was unable to provide a consignment note from the consigning company. Upon inspection, the sacks were found to contain foreign flour sacks filled with red pills, morphine powder, and other substances worth over ten thousand yuan. Wang Changgen was immediately detained, and the matter was reported to the Ximen Public Security Bureau. Furthermore, Hu Shimu (also known as Hu Zhirong), a resident of Taizhou, was apprehended outside the station and brought to the bureau. According to Hu's confession, Ye Zicai, a fellow villager residing at No. 21, Ren Shou Li, Wang Zhi Road, in the French Concession, had instructed him to have Wang deliver the goods to the station. Consequently, Shen Wenda, the captain of the Ximen Public Security Bureau's Detective Squad, led detectives, accompanied by Hu Shimu, to the French Concession Police Station to request assistance. They proceeded to No. 21, Ren Shou Li, Wang Zhi Road, where Ye Zicai was arrested and taken into custody at the police station. The following day, he was transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. The Public Security Bureau, represented by legal advisor Zhan Jifeng, along with detectives from the Detective Squad, brought Wang and Hu to the court to await questioning. A request for transfer was made, but the French Concession Police Department, citing unfinished matters, requested a postponement. After deliberation, the retrial was rescheduled for yesterday. All details have been previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiong Huiping and clerk Tao Zongkan from the Second Special District Court arrived at the Criminal Division I courtroom. After establishing their positions and addresses, Fei Xizhen, the attorney from the Police Department, presented the Police Department's investigative process against the defendant. In court, addressing Ye, the judge stated, "The last time, you presented an alibi claiming you were at the home of Teng Zhonggao at No. 37, Ji Wu Fang, Ximen Road, at 11:00 AM on the 23rd. However, after sending police to investigate, it was reported that no such person exists there. Furthermore, if you did not hand the goods to Wang Changgen and Hu Shimu for transportation, why are their testimonies identical?" The defendant replied, "I did not entrust anyone to transport such goods. This is a great injustice. Moreover, I arrived in Shanghai on the night of the 22nd and went to the shipping company on the morning of the 23rd. At 11:00 AM, I was at the home of Teacher Teng, the wife of Teng Zhonggao, in Ji Wu Fang. I request a thorough investigation." Ge Zhiqin, the defendant's defense attorney, stated that the Teng surname mentioned by the defendant actually resides at No. 35, Ji Wu Fang, not No. 37, and requested a retrial and interrogation. The judge asked the defendant, "The Shanghai Public Security Bureau now wants to transfer you for questioning. Do you have any objections?" Ye replied, "I live in the French Concession and have not committed any crimes on Chinese soil. How can I be transferred?" At this point, Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor representing the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, stood up and stated to the court, "Investigation reveals that the defendant Ye Zicai is not only involved in this crime. In November of last year, Wang Yonggui, arrested in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, for selling red pills, confessed to purchasing them from Ye Zicai. Simultaneously, it was discovered that red pill dealer Chen Wudi had remitted payment to Ye Zicai through the post office. Yiwu County requested the Zhejiang Provincial Government to issue a warrant for Ye Zicai's arrest, and the Provincial Government instructed the Shanghai Municipal Government to order the Public Security Bureau to arrest the defendant, but this was not achieved. We now have official documents from the Zhejiang Provincial Government as evidence, which we present for your inspection. Furthermore, as the government is currently strictly enforcing the ban on opium, the defendant's crime has been proven and does not conflict with the Concession Agreement. We request permission to transfer the defendant for investigation and prosecution." Shen Wenda, the captain of the Detective Squad, added, "After the Public Security Bureau received the official documents from the Zhejiang Provincial Government on November 13th of last year, I dispatched a squad leader to report to the French Concession Police Station, along with Chinese and foreign detectives, to arrest Ye at his home. Ye was not at home. According to his younger brother, Ye Mengxin, Ye Zicai had already been informed by fellow villagers, so he was not apprehended." The judge then asked Ye, "Did you know that the Zhejiang Provincial Government issued a warrant for your arrest?" He replied, "I have not committed any crime." The judge further asked, "Are you also known as Ye Tang?" He replied, "I do not have that name. I am also known as Ye Mengda." The judge asked, "Do you know Wang Xinquan?" He replied, "I do not know him." The court then ordered the Police Department's attorney and the defendant's attorney to debate the matter. Subsequently, the court ruled that Ye Zicai be handed over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for transfer and investigation. Upon hearing the verdict, the defendant and his defense attorney declared in court that they would file an appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Welcome to the Belgian Modern Art Exhibition - Xie Shou Kang <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Baron Guillaume de Giey, the Belgian Ambassador to China, places great importance on the development of cultural endeavors between China and Belgium. Last year, he organized a Belgian Modern Art Exhibition in Shanghai, and now he is organizing a similar exhibition in both Beijing and Shanghai. This year, the exhibition has been expanded, featuring over 130 works, which have been well-received in Beijing. The Shanghai exhibition will be held at Hamilton House, opening to the public today for one week. Ambassador de Giey's dedication and efforts in promoting cultural exchange between China and the East and West are commendable.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Belgian painting is not only flourishing today, but the past Belgian school, the Flemish School, has a glorious history. Before introducing this exhibition, I will briefly outline its history to trace its origins.</p>
<p>Belgium's position in European painting history is extremely important. European painting only greatly developed after the application of oil-based pigments, and the masters of oil-based pigmentation were the Van Eyck brothers from Ghent, Belgium. At the same time, the Van Eyck brothers also incorporated sciences such as anatomy and perspective into painting. They, along with Weyden, Bouts, Memlings, and Goce, founded the Flemish School, the ancient Belgian school, in the fifteenth century AD.</p>
<p>The great achievement of the Van Eyck brothers' collaboration is a shrine, also known as the Polyptych. This shrine is composed of twenty wooden panels, with paintings on the surface of the wooden panels. There are two movable panels on each side, with paintings on both the front and back. The central structure of the shrine is the Adoration of the Mystic Lamb and the Fountain of Life. The upper level has seven panels, with the victorious Jesus in the center, flanked by the Virgin Mary and Saint John; further to the sides are angels playing music. Outside the angels, there are Adam on the right and Eve on the left. The lower-level panels depict Jesus' guards, righteous judges, hermits, farmers, and so on.</p>
<p>The faces, arms, clothing folds of the figures in the "Shrine," as well as the grass, trees, and fruits in the background, are all vividly detailed and seamless. The Shrine was completed on May 6, 1432 AD and was immediately displayed in the St. John's Church in Ghent, now the St. Bavo Cathedral. By the beginning of the 19th century, the shrine was incomplete, with several panels purchased by the Berlin Museum. In 1919, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated that they be returned to Belgium.</p>
<p>Weyden's works were very popular at the time, specializing in religious paintings. The solemnity, piety, and depth of his depictions of the Virgin Mary, Saint John, Magdalene, and the suffering of "those who buried Jesus" are unprecedented. Bouts' masterpiece is the Shrine of the Church of Louvain, whose theme is the "Last Supper." In addition, there are two "triptychs," one depicting the torture of Saint Erasmus and the other depicting the quartering of Saint Hippolytus. Bouts was particularly skilled at creating drawings with personality and colors with luster. Memling was a disciple of Weyden, whose technique was precise and gentle. His religious paintings had no striking colors or alarming emotions, only seeking serenity, integrity, compassion, and grace. In Belgian painting, the translucent shadows within the gauze layer and the subtle chiaroscuro on the faces of the figures are almost unbelievable. Memling is one of the greatest portrait painters in the history of painting, and most of his works are gathered in the St. John's Hospital in Bruges. As for Goce, although not a student of Weyden, he was greatly influenced by him. Scotland, Florence, Berlin, and Bruges all hold masterpieces of Goce. Among them, the "Adoration of the Shepherds" in Florence is the greatest. With its grand structure and realistic figures, Goce was truly a precursor to the 17th-century Flemish School.</p>
<p>In contrast to the early Flemish School, the Italian schools of the Renaissance flourished in the south. Southern painting was idealist, excelling in sketching and structure, specializing in historical sites, patterns, and nudes. Northern painting was realist, emphasizing color and light, specializing in portraits, landscapes, and still lifes. Although the two schools had different purposes and techniques, their brilliant achievements inspired countless later generations.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Flemish School produced masters generation after generation, continuing without end. In the 16th century, Patinir created landscape paintings, Bosch created fantastical and demonic paintings, and Brueghel established a unique style, depicting peasant life and winter rural scenes with desolate and tragic emotions. At the time, his works were called "strange paintings." After the rise of populism in the 19th century, Bosch began to be admired by the world, recognized as the pioneer of peasant painters.</p>
<p>After Brueghel, Rubens brought the Flemish School to its culmination. Rubens encompassed everything, vividly and flawlessly depicting portraits, landscapes, animals, still lifes, religious stories, love stories, the gentry class, and folk tales. Artists of the time, and 18th-century English and French artists such as Reynolds, Gainsborough, and Watteau, all followed his example and were influenced by him. The number of works left behind by Rubens is unparalleled by any artist in history.</p>
<p>At the same time, Brouwer and Teniers specialized in small-scale paintings, creating extremely delicate, interesting, and well-organized paintings within a small format. Their success was comparable to Dutch small-scale painting, which is another characteristic of the Flemish School.</p>
<p>The 18th century was a period of decline for the Flemish School. Although there were many famous painters during this period, they could not be compared with the masters of the previous three centuries. After Belgium's independence in the 19th century, the Belgian school revived and flourished again, striving forward based on European trends to restore its inherent important position in the international arena. From 1830 to 1860, the Romantic school flourished, with the most famous painters being Lalaing and Wiertz, whose works were mostly focused on historical and symbolic paintings. From 1860 to 1880, the Realist school flourished, with the most famous painters being Groux, Stevens, and Meunier, whose specialty was depicting daily life. 1880 was the starting point of the Impressionist school. The Impressionists paid special attention to light and color, and Belgians had a great innate endowment for this, so their success was particularly great. Artists such as Glaus, Courtens, Frederic, Bastien, Ensor, Smith, Gilsoul, Laemans, and Wouters directly competed with the French masters of Impressionism's birthplace.</p>
<p>As for the Futurism, Dadaism, Cubism, Expressionism, Neo-Impressionism, and Neoclassical schools that emerged after the European War, Belgium also had them all. The first four schools were temporary trends with no achievements to speak of. The latter two schools continued to work hard, seeking light. However, in recent decades, most painters have not been bound by schools or followed existing styles, but have developed freely based on their individuality. Belgians are rich in artistic heredity and talent for color and form. Belgian painting has thus progressed and is truly inexhaustible!</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The modern Belgian school is the direct descendant of the ancient Flemish school. Although the styles of ancient and modern are different, their national characteristics are obviously present. There are many excellent works in this Belgian art exhibition. The style of the Flemish school can be seen at a glance. The exhibitors and their works are introduced separately below:</p>
<p>Among the great modern Belgian masters, the one who most admires our country's past excellent culture and is closest to our people is Mr. A. Bastien. Bastien is a painter who came from poverty, worked hard, and succeeded. He once served as the president of the Belgian Academy of Fine Arts. After the European War, he painted the Panorama de L'yser, which is 15 meters high and 150 meters long. This exhibition features a portrait of former Belgian King Albert I (No. 48). With concise brushstrokes, it fully reveals the King's heroic and indomitable spirit. There is also a flower and fruit painting with extremely simple brushstrokes and exceptionally magnificent colors.</p>
<p>Gilsoul is also one of the great modern masters, born in 1867. His "Village Front" (No. 65) has a quiet structure and skillful technique. "Old House" (No. 66) has the same style and is full of Flemish flavor.</p>
<p>Richir and Baes are both experts in women's portraits and are very popular with noble ladies. Richir's two women's portraits (No. 108 and No. 109) and Baes' two portraits of young girls (No. 9 and No. 10) are rendered in detail and are lifelike in form. Although their style is close to academic painting, their skill is unmatched.</p>
<p>Opsomer is the president of the Antwerp Academy of Fine Arts and enjoys a high reputation in the Belgian art world. Unfortunately, the color of his portrait (No. 100) in this exhibition is too yellow, perhaps due to preconceptions, and it is far from the success of his usual works. The second exhibit, "Flower," although elegant in color, seems cramped in structure.</p>
<p>Toussaint's "Flower" (No. 119), J. Albert's "Outskirts of Brussels" (No. 8), Clesse's "A Fisherman's Family" (No. 24), Creytens' landscapes (No. 34 and No. 35), Moitroux's portraits of women (No. 96 and No. 97), Thomas' "Flower Hat" (No. 118), Van de Leene's nude and Spanish woman (No. 120 and No. 121) all have skillful brushstrokes and exquisite colors, and can be called masterpieces.</p>
<p>As for Buisseret's "Contemplation" (No. 13) and "Peasant Woman" (No. 14), refined colors are added to extremely accurate sketches, and the folds of the clothes are extremely concise and have a modern flavor. This can be regarded as a representative work of the Neoclassical school.</p>
<p>Those who use knives instead of brushes are Crommelinck and Massonet. Crommelinck's "Peasant" and "Wind and Cloud" (No. 36 and No. 37), and Massonet's "Comedian Musician" and "Spaniard" (No. 90 and No. 91) all have a majestic momentum and profound meaning, and are quite unique.</p>
<p>Latinis' "Church Street" (No. 81) and "Country" (No. 82) are simple and old-fashioned, and have a power that is unforgettable. Masui uses pure Impressionist techniques to depict the sea view (No. 93) and Qingye (No. 92), which is extremely successful. Bnyle is the first of the new-style writers, and the structure and color of his works (No. 15 and No. 16) are modernized and have a unique flavor.</p>
<p>In short, judging from the whole, this Belgian art exhibition can be said to be an exhibition of a certain standard. Ambassador de Giey is enthusiastic about communicating Chinese and Western culture, and Belgian painters are actively participating in the exhibition. In addition to gratitude, we only hope that it can achieve practical success!</p>

<p>Wu Bingjun, a 25-year-old laborer from Henan, residing in Yangjia Zha, borrowed one silver dollar several years ago from Hua Hanqing, a Yangzhou native who specializes in high-interest "rubber ball money" (i.e., exorbitant interest). The agreement stipulated a daily interest payment of six copper coins. Over the past four years, the accumulated interest amounts to over 86,000 copper coins. After partial payments, approximately 12,000 copper coins remain outstanding. Hua has repeatedly pressured Wu to pay off the full principal and interest. Due to lack of funds, Wu pleaded with Hua for an extension, offering to continue paying daily interest. Hua refused, leading to a verbal altercation. Hua then resorted to violence, knocking out Wu Bingjun's front teeth, causing profuse bleeding. Police officers Zhang Shi and Hu arrived at the scene and took them to the Yimiao Police Station for investigation. After interrogation, Chief Liu determined that Hua Hanqing's exploitation of the poor through exorbitant interest constituted a criminal offense. Furthermore, his act of violence due to non-payment was deemed illegal. He was ordered to be handed over to the General Bureau for strict handling.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Ningbo County Security Command Requests Transfer of Suspect in Red Pill Case; Zheng Fengyi and Son Unjustly Arrested, Acquitted in Court Due to Lack of Evidence <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Fengyi (also known as Fengxi), a Cantonese native, operates the Yongyuan Pawnshop at No. 285 Park Road and co-owns the Faji Coal Ball Company at No. 10 Meifu Lane, No. 123 Park Road, where he serves as manager. At 9:15 AM the day before yesterday, Wang Yong, leader of the Detective Squad of the Ningbo County Security Command in Zhejiang, obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special District Court and reported to the News Agency Police Station. Together with Chinese Detective Wu Changkai and Western Detective Chief Kainatai, they went to the Faji Company and arrested Zheng Fengyi and his son Zheng Yingyan (23 years old).</p>
<p>Both were arrested on suspicion of trafficking in the narcotic red pills. They were taken to the police station and temporarily detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special District Court. The Zheng family hired attorneys Xue Dubi and Yu Xiangqin to defend them. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's attorney, stated that at around 9:00 AM yesterday, Wang Kuang, leader of the Ningbo County Security Command's Detective Squad, presented an arrest warrant (No. 389) from the court and requested assistance in arresting Zheng Qiuting and Zheng Yangxian, father and son, at No. 9 and No. 10 Meifu Lane, No. 125 Park Road.</p>
<p>This was based on the confession of Chen Yougen, a suspect in Ningbo, who claimed that he was previously a rickshaw puller for Zheng Qiuting and that the Zheng father and son were secretly manufacturing red pills, transporting them to the interior for sale. The police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to Meifu Lane. They first entered No. 9 to investigate and found no one named Zheng. Later, at No. 10, they arrested the two applicants in this case. Upon questioning, their names were</p>
<p>Completely different from those on the arrest warrant. Zheng Fengyi stated that Zheng Qiuting was his cousin and was currently in Guangdong, and that there was no one named Zheng Yangxian. The police station conducted a thorough search of the premises and found no equipment for secretly manufacturing red pills or any related documents. Subsequently, Wang, the squad leader, insisted that these were the correct individuals, so they were taken to the police station. When questioned, Zheng Fengyi stated that he operated the Yongyuan Pawnshop and served as the manager of the Faji Coal Ball Company. He had been doing business in this area for over twenty years. He had</p>
<p>Six brothers, three of whom have died. Zheng Qiuting is his third cousin and used to sell coal balls in Hankou before going to Guangdong. His family had no one named Chen Yougen, and there was no rickshaw. Zheng Yingyan stated that he was also known as Kekou and that there was no one named Zheng Yangxian. Wang Yong, the leader of the Detective Squad of the Ningbo County Security Command, stated that Zheng Yangxian had been identified by the confessed suspect Chen Yougen as</p>
<p>Secretly manufacturing red pills for distribution to other areas in their residence in the public concession. Therefore, he came to Shanghai to request assistance in the arrest. Chen also provided clear descriptions of the Zheng father and son's appearance and age, which matched the two individuals apprehended in this case. He requested their transfer. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's attorney, expressed his opinion, stating that the names of the applicants apprehended were completely different from those on the arrest warrant. Moreover, the Ningbo investigators had failed to provide</p>
<p>Sufficient evidence. Even if the two applicants in this case had committed a crime, it would have occurred within the concession. Furthermore, the police station had not found any evidence. He requested that the court order their release to prevent innocent citizens from suffering detention. The attorneys Xue and Yu debated the matter, requesting that the court grant their release to prevent innocent people from suffering imprisonment. They also presented share certificates to prove that Zheng Fengxi was not Zheng Qiuting. Judge Wu Zehan announced in court that the motion for transfer was denied and the defendants were released that day.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Yi Fangshuo Sued Again by Cousin for Loss of Reputation Although Adultery Case Dropped <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Yi Fangshuo, a comedian actor, has been expanding his business in recent years, organizing the Jingshen Troupe and recruiting young girls to be actresses in the troupe. Yi would then select those who were slightly attractive and easily tempted, using threats and inducements to defile them. As time went on, the matter gradually became public. Last winter, the case came to light, and the French Concession Police Station arrested him and brought him to the Second Special District Local Court, requesting punishment. At that time, Yi's cousin Yi Baozhu, who had been brought to Shanghai from her hometown in Hangzhou by Yi's daughter Yi Meiying and introduced into the troupe as an actress, took the opportunity to report to the French Concession Police Station that she had been living in Yi's house, receiving Yi's training in opera, and had been forcibly raped by Yi. When the police station sent detectives to investigate, Baozhu, at the instigation of Yi's relatives and Yi's wife Hu, withdrew her accusations. Therefore, when the Second Special District Court rendered its judgment, it did not accept the Baozhu's portion of the case. For the remaining part, Yi Fangshuo was sentenced to imprisonment. Until recently, the Second Branch of the High Court declared Yi not guilty, and he was released from prison and moved to No. 10 Minzhi Lane, Nanjing Road, in the British Concession, where he resumed his old profession. However, the prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court considered the judgment of the second instance to be inappropriate. He has now submitted a petition to the Supreme Court, raising appeal about the various facts of Yi's crime and the reasons why the second instance judgment was inappropriate, requesting that the judgment be reversed and Yi punished according to law. The Third Branch of the High Court has sent the entire case file to Beijing. Whether Yi is guilty or not remains to be decided by the final judgment. However, his cousin Yi Baozhu's last-minute halt, and not adding insult to injury, was purely because she valued the conditions promised by Yi Fangshuo. Now that Yi has been released from prison, he has no intention of fulfilling his former promises. She hired a lawyer to sue Yi in the First Special District Local Court for compensation for damages, claiming that in 1932, when she was 17 years old, she was introduced into the Jingshen Troupe as an actress by Yi's daughter Yi Meiying. Because she lived in Yi's house, she was raped, causing serious pain to her physical health, mental state, and reputation. She had filed a complaint with the French Concession Police Station in December of last year. Although she withdrew the lawsuit after mediation by relatives and friends, the fact of rape was not eliminated. She was subjected to illegal infringement, so she had no choice but to request the court to order the defendant to pay compensation of 5,500 yuan for her health, mental state, and reputation. As she was unable to pay the litigation fees, she requested permission to be exempted. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Daxi held a hearing. The defendant Yi Fangshuo did not appear. According to his representative lawyer, Yi had gone to Suzhou. The plaintiff Yi Baozhu was said to be 20 years old, but calculating according to the lunar calendar, her birthday was on the fifth day of the second month, which means she had not met the 20 year adult age. Therefore, she temporarily chose her cousin, Yi Fangchu, Yi Fanghu's half-brother, as her legal guardian. Yi Fangchu stated that his sister Baozhu's chastity had been destroyed by his brother Fangshuo, and she could no longer be married. Moreover, his sister's parents were both dead, and she had no one to rely on. Therefore, he requested that the court order the defendant to pay an amount of 20 yuan per month until she was 60 years old, and he hoped that the amount would be paid in one lump sum. The defendant's lawyer disputed Yi Fangchu's qualifications to represent the lawsuit, as well as whether Yi Fangshuo had committed adultery against the plaintiff. The court then decided to postpone the hearing to investigate the matter further.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Large Wind and Waves at Wusongkou Yesterday Morning, Huangpu River Continued to Experience High Tides, Water Entered Low-Lying Areas <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Outside Wusongkou, at approximately 5:00 AM yesterday, a sudden and enormous wind and wave occurred. The waves were surging and torrential, creating a very dangerous situation. At that time, ships were entering and leaving the port. To avoid danger, incoming ships dropped anchor and stopped, and outgoing ships delayed their departure. The wind and waves subsided at around 8:00 AM, and the ships resumed normal traffic. When the wind and waves occurred outside the port, the weather in the city was also extremely cold.</p>
<p>Inside the Huangpu River, there were continued high tides yesterday morning, mainly due to the large wind and waves at Wusongkou. When the tide was at its highest, it exceeded the predictions of the Dredging Bureau. Various low-lying roads in the city, such as the area in front of Huiluo Company on Sichuan Road, the area in front of Yong'an Company on Zhejiang Road, and Fuzhou Road, Jiangxi Road, and Guangdong Road, were flooded, with water reaching shin height. The water gradually receded at around 9:00 AM. (Dabai News Agency)</p>

<p>On the day before yesterday (28th), at 6:30 PM, a passerby saw someone hanging themselves from a large tree by the roadside behind house number 1375 on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession (at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue Massenet). The witness was a chauffeur, number 57, from the French Concession Fire Department, residing in the building across the street. He rushed over immediately and cut the person down. Feeling a warmth in the person’s chest, he immediately called the Fire Department, who dispatched an ambulance. The person was taken to the police station and revived. Upon questioning, he gave his name as Xu Yulin, from Anhui, age 35. He had previously worked as a butcher, but due to unemployment and economic hardship, he had resorted to this desperate measure.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Jinting Guild Hall and Piaomiao Society <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Jinting Guild Hall, located on Lujiabang in the Nanshi district of this city, was established by natives of Xishan, Dongting who were living in Shanghai. It has been around for several decades and has approximately 2,000 members. The guild hall building was also built with donations from the natives. Unexpectedly, recently a native named Zheng Zhuping suddenly initiated the Piaomiao Society, whose purpose is no different from that of a native-place association. For a time, more than a hundred people joined the society, and a founding convention was held on the 15th of this month. During the meeting, executive and supervisory committee members were elected by ballot. However, because the election results were unfavorable, they caused opposition from the members, who petitioned the city's Party headquarters to send someone to recount the votes. Yesterday, the recount revealed that the number of votes did not match the list of elected individuals. It is said that some natives who are not members of the society have telegraphed their opposition to the society and sent a letter to the Jinting Guild Hall to inquire: given that the society and the guild hall have the same purpose, where should the natives turn to in the future? This is based on the principle that two organizations of the same nature should not be established in the same area.

<p>The Queen brand cashmere wool is selling well in the market. This city's China Wool Textile Factory holds the leading position in China's wool spinning industry. The Queen brand hand-knitted cashmere wool produced by the factory has an exceptionally light and soft texture. It is incomparably warm and comfortable to knit various cold-proof clothes, far surpassing all imported products. Moreover, the size is very long. If you knit an undershirt, you need about two pounds of ordinary wool, but if you use this brand of wool, you only need a little more than one pound. Therefore, although the price is similar to ordinary wool yarn, after careful calculation, it is actually much cheaper. Since the Queen brand cashmere wool was launched, it has been very popular among ladies from all walks of life, who are vying to buy it. Recently, the factory's shipments have been in great demand, and it is working day and night to maximize production to meet market demand. All major companies on Nanjing Road in this city, as well as various wool yarn stores and department stores, sell it.</p>
<p>Wang Shuntai Western Clothing is Discounted. Wang Shuntai Western Clothing at 791 Nanjing Road, at the corner of Lloyd Road, is a well-known western clothing expert in Shanghai, known for its novel tailoring, exquisite styles, and top-quality materials that never go out of shape, so it has a good reputation and is widely known. It is heard that the store has just shipped a large batch of wool fabrics from Europe and the United States, with a wide variety of patterns, which are very suitable for winter clothing materials. In order to maintain contact with customers, the store is holding a large seasonal discount for three weeks, which is a good opportunity to add winter clothes during this cold and windy time.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Letter <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor, In today's edition of your newspaper, in the local news column, there is a report about famine refugees selling their children and Westerners appealing on their behalf, which includes the phrase "Finally, after further inquiries with various Chinese and foreign charity organizations, although they were treated with courtesy, they also stated that they could not accommodate the refugees coming to Shanghai." After investigation, our association did not receive any report from this Westerner about the aforementioned situation. However, compassion is something everyone has, and it is even more so when foreigners cannot bear to see it and appeal on their behalf. Even if there is no place to accommodate them, we should still try to find a way to help. It is inevitable that there was an error. Therefore, we are writing this letter to clarify and request that you publish this letter in a prominent position to avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Hua Yang Yi Zhen Hui, 24.11.29.</p>
<h3 id="e144">A Visit to the China Wool Textile Factory (Continued) <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yuxuan</p>
<p>The second part of the factory is the wool dyeing field. It is to dye the bundled wool threads into various colors for buyers to choose from. The dyeing site of the factory can be divided into two major processes: dyeing and air drying. In the dyeing part, there are four automatic dyeing machines. The so-called automatic dyeing machine uses a pump to circulate the boiling water in the dyeing tank, so as to avoid the disadvantage of uneven dye paste when the velvet thread is dyed. In addition, there are two manual dyeing machines for emergency needs. Now these four automatic dyeing machines can dye 56 different colors. After the wool thread is dyed, the second step is to send it to a hot air dryer for air drying. An electric fan is installed on the machine, and a water tank is installed below. Usually the temperature inside the machine is often 70 degrees Celsius. The dyed wool thread is sent into the machine and can be blown dry in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The last part is the inspection and packaging area of ​​the wool thread. The dyed wool thread must undergo manual inspection to see if there are any defects. If it is considered perfect after inspection, the trademark is manually pasted and packed, so as to prepare for transportation to the central market to serve. So far, the manufacturing work of wool threads is all completed.</p>
<p>The factory currently has more than 100 male and female workers, most of whom are female workers. The factory treats workers not only by paying wages according to their working ability, but also by providing food and accommodation to reduce the trivialities of the daily life of the workers so that they can work with peace of mind. At the same time, special attention is paid to the management and training of male and female workers. Because workers are a major element of production, the knowledge, skills, and health of workers are closely related to production capacity. Therefore, the factory should also conduct special training based on the above three principles in addition to the workers' work. The factory's production capacity can now spin 1,800 pounds of wool thread per day, and the highest can reach more than 2,000 pounds. The products it produces are divided into knitted cashmere (i.e. knitted wool thread) and hand-woven cashmere (hand-woven wool thread), both of which are of excellent quality. Knitted cashmere is mostly 40-count and 32-count thread, and hand-woven cashmere is mostly 4-strand thread. The daily production of knitted and hand-woven cashmere is about 900 pounds each. The trademark used when selling it on the mountain market is the Foreign Queen brand, which means that it has the ambition to expand the world market.</p>
<p>After the visit, the reporters were very pleased, but I personally felt that there was still one thing that must be improved, that is, the issue of raw material use. The raw materials currently used in the factory are wool tops rather than raw wool. Most of these wool tops are purchased from Australia, and occasionally from countries such as England and France, but domestic products have not yet been adopted. According to Mr. Chen, the factory's reason for using foreign wool tops is that China's customs charges the same tax rate for imports of wool tops and raw wool. However, when manufacturing wool threads, the wool threads that can be made from raw wool are only about half of the wool threads made from the same amount of wool tops. For the sake of overall cost, it is not necessary to purchase Sichuan wool as raw materials. As for domestic wool, due to the quality of the wool thread, only Shanxi Province has an annual production of about 60,000 pounds that can be used by the factory, while the factory needs more than 2 million pounds of wool per year, which is far from meeting the demand. But in my memory, northern China is rich in wool. The annual export volume is quite large. Taking last year as an example, China's wool exports were more than 250,000 dan, worth more than 34 million yuan. If the factory can study and improve the manufacturing method and find ways to use domestic wool, then the factory's raw materials will not be controlled by foreigners in the future, and its future development will be even more unlimited.</p>

<h3 id="e145">The Influence of Constellations on Radio Waves <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Jueming</p>
<p>(1) The Relationship Between Constellations and Radio Waves</p>
<p>Anyone who has studied radio even slightly knows how closely radio waves are related to the sun and moon, especially the number of sunspots, solar eclipses, and the position of the moon, which have the greatest impact on radio waves.</p>
<p>However, relatively few people pay attention to the stars that fill the sky like so many pearls and gemstones. Ordinary radio researchers may think that the stars are too small to be of any importance and therefore can be ignored. But this is a big mistake. If we think about how many constellations are around the earth, it is not difficult to know how great their impact on radio waves is. What's more, the sun and moon, strictly speaking, are just one of the constellations.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, the stars are divided into "meteors" and "constellations" and explained in detail below:</p>
<p>(2) The Relationship Between Meteors and Radio Waves</p>
<p>On a clear evening sky, when looking up at the bright moon or counting those brilliant stars, you can often see a streak of starlight flying by, as if the stars are moving house. This is the so-called "meteor."</p>
<p>In astronomy, meteors have no direct relationship with fixed stars. Meteors are actually fragments of iron or stone floating and wandering between constellations, which are attracted by the earth's gravity and run into the earth's atmosphere, colliding and rubbing against the air to generate high heat and light.</p>
<p>According to scholars' analysis, the main components of meteors are no more than: light gas, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, magnesium, sodium, iron, copper, aluminum, calcium, manganese, nickel, silicon, potassium, cobalt, etc. These substances become tiny powder scattered in the air, its size is about one-tenth or one-hundredth of a micron in diameter (i.e. one millionth of a meter.) This kind of fine particles stays in the air for a long time and is not easy to fall. According to the research of Dr. Nagaoka in Japan, it takes about three years for the place where the meteor occurs to reach the surface of the earth. Ordinary meteors occur on average at a height of 114.4 zai from the earth's surface and disappear at 79.6 zai; however, there are also some that reach the earth's surface, but the number is very small. Its falling speed is about 4.40 meters per second.</p>
<p>The "Icn" generated by this kind of meteor diffuses around the meteor's orbit. The disappearance of this "Icn" varies depending on its diffusion state, the impact of the Earth's magnetic force, and the light pressure of sunlight, so it cannot be generalized, but generally speaking, it seems to take a lot of time; the impact of meteors on radio waves often continues to exist for dozens of days, which is why.</p>
<p>So how many of these meteors are there? According to astronomers, there are about eight visible to the naked eye per hour; however, what we can see in our eyes, in other words, our visual field, is actually only a small part of the sky around the earth. In fact, the total number of meteors that can be seen by the naked eye of all mankind on earth is about more than 20 million per day; if we include those that cannot be seen by the naked eye and must be observed with a telescope, then the number is as high as 400 million. From this point of view, the great influence of meteors on radio waves is not without reason.</p>
<p>Not only that, there is a so-called "meteor swarm" in the orbit that the earth is traveling in; in this orbit, meteor streams are scattered in groups, the number is the most; so when the earth enters this orbit, the influence of the meteor stream on radio waves will naturally be the most intense. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e146">Ultra-Short Wave Emission Vacuum Tube <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Pao</p>
<p>No. 304A</p>
<p>The progress of radio science has promoted the increase of countless radio stations, and the current frequency range is not enough to be allocated. Therefore, the ultra-short wave band with a vast land and sparse population has been gradually developed. In order to conduct further research on ultra-short waves, ultra-short wave emission vacuum tubes that can generate greater power are of course in great need.</p>
<p>Ordinary emission vacuum tubes can still work normally at a frequency of about 15 MHz (20 meters); but above 30 MHz, the efficiency is greatly reduced; when the frequency is higher, there is even no output. According to research results, the reason why the effectiveness of emission vacuum tubes weakens at extremely high frequencies is probably: 1. The current that charges the interelectrode capacitance of the vacuum tube increases due to the increased frequency, and this current passes through the wires inside the tube, resulting in extremely large power loss. 2. When the frequency increases, the oscillation period (Pariod) is similar to the time required for electrons to travel from the cathode to the screen, and the thunder voltage current in each part is in an inappropriate phase (such as the screen voltage and screen current), and the output is small. 3. At extremely high frequencies, the self-inductance and capacitance in the matching circuit are very small. Therefore, the internal self-inductance and capacitance of the vacuum tube, which can usually be ignored, also have a great impact at this time. Therefore, vacuum tubes for generating ultra-short waves must: thicken the wires inside the tube, reduce the distance between the screen cathode appropriately, and reduce the internal self-inductance and capacitance to the minimum possible range. The 304A (Westerne'ectric 304A) ultra-short wave emission vacuum tube of the Western Electric Company of the United States is designed and manufactured based on the above-mentioned improvements.</p>
<p>The external shape of 304A is shown in the attached figure. Its grid and screen are led out from the top of the glass tube (therefore the lead wire is shortened, and the support for the grid or screen can be omitted. Moreover, the insulation ability of glass at extremely high frequencies is also excellent). The screen is made of graphite (graphite has a higher heat dissipation capacity than metal, so the screen area is reduced and the interelectrode capacitance is also reduced at the same time): the screen is very close to the cathode, so the time for electrons to fly from the cathode to the screen is also considerably reduced. 304A is used for oscillation and amplification. At 100 MHz (3 meters), it can work according to the specified power (output about 110 watts at a screen voltage of 1,250 volts); if the frequency is higher, the output will be reduced considerably, but it can still have considerable output at 300 MHz (1 meter!).</p>
<h3 id="e147">Electrical Power and Electrical Rate (Continued) <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>

<p>The quantity marked within the semicircle in the diagram equals the product of the quantities marked within the two quadrants multiplied together; the quantity marked within one quadrant equals the quotient of the quantity marked within the semicircle divided by the quantity marked within the other quadrant.</p>
<p>According to Ohm's Law, electrical power can also be expressed in terms of current and resistance, or voltage and resistance. Because V=IR</p>
<p>Therefore P=VI=IRXI=I2R……(4)</p>
<p>Because I=VR</p>
<p>Therefore P=VI=VXVV2……(5)＝RR</p>
<p>Electrical power is the product of voltage and current. Therefore, if there is voltage but no current, or if there is current but no voltage, the electrical power is equal to zero. The diagram above shows the relationship between the output electrical power (Output Power) of a generator or battery and the change in load resistance (Load resistance). Ammeter A and voltmeter V are connected to measure the electrical power output.</p>
<p>(A) The diagram shows an open circuit (Opon Circuit) in the output circuit, where the line resistance is infinite. Therefore, the current measured by the ammeter is zero. Although the voltage measured by the voltmeter is the full value of the generated voltage, the electrical power is the product of the output current and output voltage, so the output electrical power is also equal to zero. (B) The diagram shows that the output circuit has no resistance, called a short circuit (Short Circuit), so the current measured by the ammeter is extremely high. However, because the resistance of the output circuit is zero, the voltage measured by the voltmeter is zero. Therefore, the output electrical power is also zero; all the electrical power of the generator is consumed by the internal resistance of the machine itself. (C) The diagram shows a normal output circuit, where the circuit resistance is R. If R is varied, the current and voltage will change accordingly, so the output electrical power will also change. As the resistance increases, the current decreases, but the voltage increases; conversely, as the resistance decreases, the current increases, but the voltage decreases. The electrical power output is maximized when R is exactly equal to the internal resistance of the machine.</p>
<p>Electrical work is the product of electrical power and time. Let T represent time, and W represent electrical work, then W=VIF…………(6)</p>
<p>W=I2RF……(7)</p>
<p>Or W=V2FR……(8)</p>
<p>When time is measured in seconds, the unit of electrical work or electrical energy is the Joule; a Joule is the electrical energy consumed by a current of I Ampere flowing through a resistance of I Ohm in I second, or the work done by a current of one Ampere at a voltage of one Volt in one second. In formulas (6), (7), and (8), if V is in Volts, I is in Amperes, R is in Ohms, and T is in seconds, then W is in Joules. Therefore,</p>
<p>Joule = Volts × Amperes × Seconds</p>
<p>Watt = Joules/Second</p>
<p>When time is measured in hours, the unit of electrical work is the Watt-hour; one Watt-hour is the product of one Watt of electrical power and one hour. Larger units of electrical work include hectowatt-hours and kilowatt-hours. The electricity measured by ordinary electric meters (commonly called "fire meters") is in kilowatt-hours. One "unit of electricity" is one kilowatt-hour. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Guoguang Middle School basketball team members, though once defeated by Youyou, are quite strong, excelling in both offense and defense, not comparable to ordinary middle school basketball teams. This year, they also added Xiqing. In preparation for vigorous training, they specially invited seven basketball teams for a friendly match at the Youyou basketball court yesterday. The seven teams were all veteran players, but having been away from the court for a long time, they lacked stamina and had difficulty running. They had a fierce presence upon entering the court. Wang Huating took advantage of Chen Anbang's foul to score first, and Guoguang's Gao Baosheng immediately responded. From then on, both sides made progress, and the scores were very close. Guoguang eventually fell behind. In the first half, the seven teams led with a score of thirteen to eleven. Starting from the second half, the veterans became fatigued, while Guoguang became increasingly adept at playing, and their shooting was particularly accurate, although there were occasional mistakes in their movements, which was a slight flaw. As a result, Guoguang made a comeback with a score of twenty-seven to twenty-four. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Guoguang Position Fouls Points</p>
<p>Huang Gongwei Left Forward 〇 Six</p>
<p>Chen Anbang Left Forward Three Eleven</p>
<p>Gao Baosheng Center Two Eight</p>
<p>Lu Bingjin Right Guard Three 〇</p>
<p>Wang Cuneng Right Guard Two Two</p>
<p>Bai Fangzheng Left Guard Two 〇</p>
<p>Total Twelve Twenty-seven</p>

<p>Fifteen, Provincial Obstetric School and Private Jisheng Obstetric School</p>
<p>The Provincial Obstetric School currently has two classes with 50 students. They are recommended by various counties, which are responsible for their expenses. After graduation, they return to their original places of origin to set up obstetric clinics. The intention is excellent, but the students are young, averaging less than 18 years old, which has a significant impact on their service beliefs. The equipment of the affiliated hospital is being improved and is considered complete. The original regulations allowed for graduation after two years, followed by three to four months of internship before being assigned. This should be changed to comply with the new regulations, with a uniform three-year program, increasing the internship period for proficiency.</p>
<p>The Private Jisheng Obstetric School has two classes with 35 students. The hospital and all equipment are rudimentary, and there are very few maternity patients hospitalized, so students cannot gain practical experience. After graduation, they visit the Provincial Hospital for several weeks and then undergo three months of internship. The methods and regulations do not comply with the requirements. In general, the school is quite capable of technical cooperation with the Provincial Hospital, but the lack of resources is a significant inconvenience and should be improved.</p>
<p>Sixteen, Private Zhijiang College Affiliated High School Business Department, Private Jishan High School Senior Business Department</p>
<p>The Business Department of the Private Zhijiang Affiliated High School was newly established this year and currently has only one class with 25 students. The main purpose is to prepare students for admission to the school's economics department. The method is not ideal. General courses account for 25 hours per week and are taught in the same classes as regular middle school students. Business courses include only commercial geography, bookkeeping, abacus calculation, and an overview of commerce, totaling ten hours, which does not comply with the regulations. There is no practical training equipment. It should be improved quickly. Business courses should account for five-eighths of the total curriculum, with the remainder focusing on preparing for employment.</p>
<p>The Business Department of Private Jishan High School has three classes with 50 students. The first graduating class this year saw approximately half of its students find employment. The school's bank is relatively well-established, while the store is very simple, with three typewriters. The allocation of practice time is appropriate. Most of the general courses are taught in the same classes as the regular department. There are nine banks in the school's location. Efforts should be made to strengthen connections and cooperation to seek convenience. There is still a lack of attention to the practical problems of business and the province's production and consumption situation.</p>
<p>Seventeen, Ningbo County Vocational Commercial School, Zhenhai County Junior Commercial School, Jiaxing County Junior Commercial School, Haining County Junior Middle School Junior Commercial Department</p>
<p>Ningbo County Vocational Commercial School is divided into junior and senior levels, with six junior commercial classes and three senior commercial classes, totaling 340 students. The junior commercial program is divided into two-year and three-year systems. The former is designed for those who hope to complete their studies quickly for employment purposes. The content of the academic and commercial subjects is less and simpler compared to the three-year system. The senior level has a banking department. The junior commercial level has practical training in stores, typing, bookkeeping, and abacus calculation. The store organization is quite complete, which is rare in other schools. However, daily business is limited, with sales limited to stationery and food. The amount of money coming in and out is very small, and the value of the training materials is very low. If it can be expanded to outside the school, increase capital, and improve business, this kind of organization will be more beneficial. The school bank for senior students' practice, although the procedures and methods are the same as actual banks, the small amount of money involved may prevent students from taking things seriously. Every effort should be made to entrust the collection of tuition and meal fees and encourage teachers and students to deposit money to expand the scope. About half of the junior commercial graduates find employment, mostly in banks, with a few continuing their studies. Management is lax, and there is no training in good commercial habits. If adapting to environmental needs is considered, commercial supplementary classes should be added.</p>
<p>Zhenhai County Junior Commercial School has four classes with about 100 students. The practical training equipment is very simple, and teaching also lacks practicality. The first graduating class this year faces great difficulty in finding employment. Most of them continue their studies in senior commercial schools. If the school can contact business magnates beforehand, it seems that there should not be a problem to introduce the dozen or so students. The school's difficulty in student placement and a small number of local people advocate restoring junior high school, and the matter is being submitted for approval. This is not a good solution. In terms of the environment, Zhenhai merchants hold the leading position in Shanghai's business community and should be a suitable place for running junior commercial schools or commercial supplementary classes. The school should invite business leaders to organize advisory or placement committees to plan for student placement in advance to avoid temporary panic and helplessness.</p>
<p>Jiaxing County Junior Commercial School has three classes, with the third grade divided into typing and bookkeeping groups, totaling over 100 students. Although it has a long history, its performance is ordinary. Only half of the graduates engage in commerce. The typing and bookkeeping equipment is still good, but the bank and stores are very simple. Most of the students are children of businessmen. The teaching of various subjects, such as commercial geography and commercial arithmetic, lacks relevance and is not suitable for the times. Commercial supplementary classes should be added or redesigned to accommodate students who are employed part-time.</p>
<p>Haining County Junior Middle School Commercial Department is similar to Jiaxing County Junior Commercial School, with one class of 40 students. Most students, except for those who are employed part-time, have no commercial prospects. The practical training equipment is extremely lacking. There are many general subjects, focusing on preparing for further studies. Methods should be found to improve this. If necessary, commercial supplementary classes should be established.</p>

<p>Everyone pays respect and sings praises to the victors. Where is there time to comfort a victimized lamb? The plaintive weeping of the weak and small drifts in the cold wind of the night. How can it compare to the pleasing sound of a triumphal song?</p>
<p>We humans live in hope and perish in despair.</p>
<p>A smile through tears is more sorrowful than mournful cries.</p>
<p>A child struggling in a warm bed is the first step of resistance.</p>
<p>Our life force should be like a clock that tells time accurately, step by step, never stopping, doing what needs to be done without a second of error.</p>
<p>A friend said with emotion, "Only death can reveal true love. Where has true love ever existed in the world?" Another said, "To seek true love in this world is better than seeking sympathy in hell." Both are insightful views, but those who are lost in the sea of love and desire will not awaken.</p>

<p>— Ping Chang</p>
<p>I was traveling in Japan when Mr. Sun Deqian passed away. I only learned of it upon my return to the country, from Professor Ma Gongyu. I sighed for several days. Mr. Sun, known as Aikang, was from Wuxian. He was knowledgeable in all fields of study, especially proficient in the works of various philosophers. He was of noble character and indifferent to worldly fame. He taught at the Shanghai University in his old age and lived in poverty. He passed away at the end of last month due to stomach illness at the age of sixty-nine. His published works include over twenty books such as "Critical Analysis of Sima Qian's Historical Records," "Examples of Bibliography in the Book of Han," and "General Outline of Ancient Books on Various Philosophers," which are profound and comprehensive, unprecedented. Scholars in Japan admired him greatly. During the reign of Emperor Showa, Minister of Education Etō Chizuru presented his book for imperial review. According to the Japanese, such an honor is not easily obtained even by natives. At that time, Wu Changshuo jokingly said to Mr. Sun, "I received a bronze statue, only from calligraphy and painting friends. It is a small matter going from below to above. You can be called a gentleman going from above to above." I once read a Japanese cultural publication that called Zhang Taiyan a great writer, but called Mr. Sun a great scholar. In fact, Mr. Sun's writing is compared with Li Shenyan. Qian Jibo once said, "In modern times, these two are the only masters of parallel prose." Wang Guowei said that Shenyan was too ornate, while Mr. Sun's style was free and clear, so he should be superior. Wang Guowei did not praise people lightly, but he admired Mr. Sun and Zhang Mengqu. He once visited Shen Meisou with them. Meisou gave them a poem with the line, "Three guests gather at Wuhui at one time, and ninety percent of the people doubt it," referring to Mr. Sun, Wang Guowei, and Zhang Mengqu. Meisou also once said, "There are many poets and few writers in Shanghai, many writers and few scholars. You and Wang and Zhang are truly worthy of being scholars." These are all things I learned from being by the side of the elders in the past. It has not been long since Meisou returned to the mountain, and Wang Guowei drowned himself. Now, Mr. Sun's death has also been heard. The great masters of national studies have almost all withered away, and the fate of the nation is even more unbearable to ask. Alas, how can I not mourn in my heart! (No payment accepted)</p>

<p>— Jia Chengsheng</p>
<p>Opium smoke is like chronic tuberculosis, harming life and destroying nature, with extreme consequences. Yet those who are addicted to it think it can provide momentary excitement, so they do not hesitate to drink poison to quench their thirst. Now its poison has spread throughout the country, posing a great obstacle to the future of the nation. The government has issued strict orders and severe prohibitions to save the country from danger, which is well-founded.</p>
<p>The name of opium varies. It is called Wuxiang, or Wuyan. Its original name is opium, also called Apian, also called Yarong, also called Afurong, also called Hepurong.</p>
<p>China originally did not produce this substance. It was imported from foreign countries. However, from what time and from where it was imported is unknown. In historical records, the "Great Ming Code" records tribute from various countries, stating that opium was included in the tribute from countries such as Siam and Java. This is the earliest record. The import of opium may have begun at this time.</p>
<p>Also, in the "Compendium of Materia Medica" written by Li Shizhen during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, the "Grain" section says: Opium was rarely heard of in previous generations, but recently some have used it. It also says: Afurong is the sap of the poppy flower. When the bud is forming, use a needle to prick the outer green skin in the afternoon, being careful not to damage the inner skin. Prick three to five places. The next morning, the sap will come out. Scrape it into porcelain with a bamboo knife and dry it in the shade for medicinal use.</p>
<p>Also, Fang Yizhi's "Minor Knowledge of Physics" says: Collect the sap of poppies into porcelain, seal the mouth with paper, and use it after sunning it for fourteen days. The method has been passed down like this. It is used to treat diarrhea or as a bedroom medicine. It is warm and astringent and not very harmful. This is all used as medicine. If it is loaded into a gun and inhaled, there is no such method.</p>
<p>I remember that someone once wrote a pagoda poem about opium smoke, which was extremely humorous. The poem says: "Alas, unbearable, addiction comes, let's turn on the lamp, grab the gun and blow into it, sucking for excitement, regardless of the fields turning to ashes, enjoying life is arranged by fate, you don't eat and you won't get rich." Although this is playful writing, it depicts the psychology of smokers vividly.</p>
<p>There is also a poem about people smoking, saying: "A withered skeleton ascends to the ghost register, two lines of clear tears tremble on the shoulders of the poet, and the door of the room is half-closed, resenting people asking, the curtains are low, knowing only oneself," all of which are worthy of depicting the situation.</p>

<p>Episode Twenty-One: Gently Complying, Over the Courtyard, Pitying the Moonlight Appearance; Vigorously Instructing the Son-in-Law, Listening to the Lion's Roar from the Next Room</p>
<p>As he spoke, he smiled slightly at Zhiqian again, expecting his concrete reply. Zhiqian thought for a moment and laughed: Although there is a way, I am not convenient to announce it temporarily. Bei Hai put down his hand and unconsciously stretched it to his head to scratch it a few times, asking: Not convenient to announce? Zhiqian simply gave him a conundrum to guess, smiling and nodding twice. At this moment, he had a chance to turn around and heard the servant whispering a series of words in the next room. What he was reporting was the matter of Jia Duocai and his wife in the front yard. Zhiqian looked at the wall, smiled and looked at Bei Hai, and then the two listened further. He heard the woman answer: What? Is that man named Jia bullying people like this! How much money did he spend to buy out someone else's family? The servant replied: I heard it was one hundred and fifty yuan. The woman said: One hundred and fifty yuan to break up someone else's family, this man named Jia is too cruel. But the family who sold Jia's daughter is too worthless, just one hundred and fifty yuan. The servant did not speak, there was a smile, and the director said slowly: Just one hundred and fifty yuan? Is that a small amount? In Gansu, there are many people who sell their sons and daughters for one yuan and fifty cents. The woman issued a very stern voice and said: If there are such cheap people, why don't you buy two heads for me? The director replied: That was when there was a famine two years ago. The woman said: You're talking nonsense about what happened two years ago? The director was silent. The woman said: Servant, call one of the woman's family members, I have something to say to him. The servant laughed: Mrs. Hu, why bother asking about their affairs. They are all people without knowledge, and if one sentence is not pleasant, they will start crying. The woman said: People don't shed tears unless they are sad. If they haven't been wronged, why would they cry? I'm not afraid of crying, you just call someone over, I have something important to ask him. Then there were footsteps, and the servant brought a smiling face from outside the window. (368)</p>

<p>In an alley that runs from Jiaozhou Road to the Shen Garden football field, on the tall walls of the Meiyi Company, I saw four large white chalk characters: "Ban Che Zhaotie (禁扯招貼)." Of course, this is a misspelling of "Ban Zhi Zhaotie (禁止招貼)," which means "No Posting." But how much is it enough to make people feel the sense of "a slight deviation can lead to a great difference!"</p>
<p>The complexity of the construction of Chinese characters is indeed a drawback. However, the misuse of the characters "Zhi (止)" and "Che (扯)" still seems too bizarre. Just imagine, "Ban Che Zhaotie (禁扯招貼)" doesn't it not only not prohibit posting but also give posters a kind of protection?</p>
<p>If the owner of Meiyi Company passed by here, I think he would definitely smile.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Beauty Chrysanthemum <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>It was when chrysanthemums were in full bloom last year that a girl began to come to my dormitory to sell fresh flowers. Every day, a full basket, in less than half an hour, was always sold out, and she happily carried the empty basket back. Although the patrons were all young, hungry wolves, buying flowers was just a pretext. In reality, they were buying the girl's smile, but the girl did not hesitate to give a few unpriced smiles to promote her fresh flowers.</p>
<p>According to the girl, her surname was Huang, and her name was Jumei, sixteen years old, from Shantang outside Suzhou City. Because her father died, and there was a mother and younger siblings, she had to come out to earn some meager profits to make a living. So a Yangchang talented man named Lao Yu gave her a trademark called "Beauty Chrysanthemum."</p>
<p>Beauty Chrysanthemum, probably because the title of "Beauty" was added, was not as frost-resistant as chrysanthemum branches and often had a slight cough. Every month or half a month, she would always be sick for two or three days. Although she wore a thick layer of white powder on her face and some outdated red rouge, the back of her neck and hands showed a deep layer of ginger yellow. Therefore, our Yangchang talented man, Lao Yu, pinched his nose and recited to her, "Pitiable person is thinner than yellow flower." When Beauty Chrysanthemum heard him recite this, she always twisted her slender waist and said, "Pee, what do you want to pity me for? Really unlucky!" Following these few sentences, there was always a burst of happy laughter from a large group of young people.</p>
<p>From July of this year, Beauty Chrysanthemum no longer came to our dormitory. Her mother came to replace her, saying that her daughter was suffering from weakness and was lying down and could not come out. But the old woman came for a week, and no one paid attention, so she brought Beauty Chrysanthemum's twelve-year-old sister every day. Although the business was not as good as Beauty Chrysanthemum, it was still able to sell some.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a sad message was brought by the old woman and shook the whole dormitory, saying that Beauty Chrysanthemum had died. What a coincidence, it was the season when yellow flowers wither!</p>

<p>The cook at the Kang Nao Tuo Road Mental Hospital in this city recently purchased several duck eggs from the local market. The shells were greenish in color (commonly called green-shelled duck eggs). Unexpectedly, upon opening them, he discovered a strange egg. The eggshell and yolk were no different from ordinary eggs, but the egg white was blood-red, which he found very peculiar. He immediately reported it to the hospital staff, who were all amazed. It is said that the hospital is now storing this egg in a glass cup, along with the eggshell, for proper preservation. This is hastily recorded for the study of physiologists.</p>

<p>It is said that a constant smile is good for one's health, as the saying goes: "A smile a day keeps the doctor away." In these times when all major matters must be discussed later, let's find a few jokes to tell. "While there's life, there's hope." If we cultivate a healthy body, what can we not do? Therefore, promoting jokes is no less effective than holding a sports meeting! Haha!</p>
<p>The King of Freeloaders Zhao Jun, an unemployed vagrant, relied on his robust physique to repeatedly scam food and drink in hotels and restaurants. After filling his belly, he would wipe his mouth, say hello, and those timid shopkeepers, considering themselves unlucky, would let him leave triumphantly. Some less agreeable shopkeepers, apart from giving him a beating, could only drag him to the police station. Luckily, he had a strong body; a few blows were nothing to him. Even if he was taken to the police station and detained for a few days, Zhao Jun didn't care. Once released, he would continue his ways, freeloading as he pleased. One day, Zhao Jun was dragged into the Public Security Bureau again for freeloading. The branch director, unable to bear it any longer, personally interrogated him. After asking the usual questions like his name, he asked with a smile, "Why do you keep freeloading?" Zhao Jun also smiled and said, "Director, if I don't freeload, I'll be hungry; wouldn't I starve to death?" The director still said with a smile, "Fine, if you can't live without freeloading, I'll just fulfill your wish. I'll send you to a reformatory to freeload for years!" As the director spoke, his face was still smiling, but the smile on Zhao Jun's face vanished instantly.</p>
<p>Amusing Anecdotes of Gamblers Three famous gamblers, A, B, and C, met one day and planned to gamble. After making arrangements, they invited Mr. D to play mahjong together. After the four of them started the game, they naturally adopted the principle of "three feeding one," using secret signals to communicate. They were gleefully "carrying Mr. D in a sedan chair" when Mr. D, who was also an experienced gambler, noticed something was amiss. He carefully observed and completely deciphered the secret signals of A, B, and C. So, when A wanted tiles of the "tube" suit, he would give A the tube tiles; when B wanted tiles of the "string" suit, he would give B the string tiles. A, B, and C were completely baffled by Mr. D, like Zhang Tianshi, the Taoist master, gazing at each other in confusion. In the end, Mr. D used his skills and won over a hundred yuan. A, B, and C looked at each other, sighed, and said to each other, "Unexpectedly, we three sedan carriers have become car engines today, getting driven around so much that we can't be our own masters!" (Note: In gambling mahjong, "three feeding one" is called "carrying the sedan chair," and "one feeding three" is called "sitting in a car.")</p>
<p>Eating Crab Antics In the ninth month for female crabs and the tenth month for male crabs, when the chrysanthemums are blooming, crabs are naturally a seasonal delicacy. The fat and roe are plentiful, and the taste is endless. So, in the past few days, crabs have become a good accompaniment to wine in restaurants. One day, Mr. A was drinking with his friends and said with a laugh, "These days, crabs are worth savoring, so old crabs are ultimately good things." Mr. B laughed, "Don't brag. You're the type who gets drunk even from wine dregs. Whether it's old crabs or small crabs, it's truly 'like a beggar eating a dead crab, every one is good.'" These two gentlemen were already quite drunk. Over the topic of old crabs and dead crabs, they argued back and forth, verbally sparring and exchanging insults. They smashed cups and bowls, overturned tables and benches. Mr. A's head was smashed by Mr. B, and Mr. B's mouth was punched swollen by Mr. A. The police tied them up and took them to the police station. The next day, after sobering up, A and B sighed and said to each other, "For the sake of old crabs, we became two big 'bundled crabs' last night."</p>

<h3 id="e183">Cotton Yarn: November Contracts, Cotton Yarn Delivery and its Process; Market Prices Reach New Highs from Low to High; Trading is Active and the Delivery Volume is Quite Alarming <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Golden Rooster Brand Yarn The November contract was listed on June 1st of this year, with a price of 169.8 yuan, gradually rising to 171.9 yuan. Then, due to the unrest in the north and the deep penetration of foreign yarn into the mainland, selling at reduced prices, Chinese yarn was greatly hit. In addition, the silver market was extremely tight, business in all directions was depressed, and Japanese merchants frequently sold. On June 19th, the lowest price was seen at 165.9 yuan. At this time, the price of yarn fell daily, and the factory was in great difficulty. A part of the operation was difficult, and those who stopped or reduced work due to inflexible turnover became more serious. As production decreased, the market showed a positive trend, and as the gold bar rose, rumors spread in the market, saying that the currency problem would definitely be realized. And those close to a certain aspect rushed to the cotton yarn market and absorbed a large amount. As a result, the market moved forward, and the highest price was seen at 179.6 yuan on July 29th. Unexpectedly, after the price was high, it hindered actual sales, customers stopped working, and business felt particularly deserted. The market price went from high to low. How could one know that it would rain every night in a leaky house? The U.S. cotton loan was changed from 1.2 to 0.9, and the world cotton industry had a once crazy decline trend. The yarn market followed the trend and went down, repeatedly breaking the 70 yuan mark. Later, after October, the rising trend in the market gradually subsided, and the rumors of the gold bar market were extremely fierce. The enthusiasm of the people was rare in history. The price of gold skyrocketed, quickly breaking through three major barriers, breaking through 1,000 yuan, then to more than 100 yuan, and then rushing out of the 200 yuan barrier, with new peaks appearing one after another. The market was greatly shocked, and rumors abounded. The crowds focused on currency, and speculators were enthusiastic. The banking industry first bought frantically, and the chips in the market became more and more tight. The market soared, pushing towards the peak. On November 4th, after the Ministry of Finance announced that the banknotes of the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were legal tender, the market became more chaotic. Later, with a certain party willing to maintain and spit out according to the market to stabilize the market. However, the frenzy of buying created a new record since the start of the exchange, with a plate soaring by 5.5 yuan, breaking through the 200 yuan barrier, and the highest peak reaching 202 yuan, the new high price since December of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Later, due to the emergence of bulls and the assassination of Japanese sailors in Hongkou, there were many doubts in the market, and rumors arose, causing prices to fall step by step, again breaking the 90 yuan barrier. Before long, public debt rose, and Shanghai dispelled rumors from the authorities, and the people were greatly relieved. Various industries returned to their previous state, and Chinese and foreign yarn stocks were greatly reduced, shrinking to 26,000 packages. The market rebounded, returning to 199 yuan, and the last plate was 197.5 yuan. As a result, the delivery price on the 3rd was 198 yuan, and the remaining 7,250 packages, of which 4,000 packages were self-delivered. The goods were only 100 packages of 20-count Weaver Girl, 50 packages of Ball Crane, 50 packages of Double Globe, 50 packages of Da Fa, and the rest were all self-delivered.

<p>Zhengzhou Standard Cotton The November contract was listed on the market on June 1st of this year with a price of 31.5 yuan, rising to 32.25 yuan. Then, due to the slump in the yarn market and the increasing number of yarn factories reducing work and closing down, the demand was reduced. In addition to the 800,000 dan of Chinese cotton stocks in this city, the Lingxian cotton item accumulated 100,000 pieces. Therefore, there was a surplus of old cotton. Under this condition, it was more difficult for the cotton market to consolidate. On June 19th, the low price was seen at 30.07 yuan. Later, due to bad weather and excessive rainfall, the floods in the north were severe, and the cotton fields in Hubei Province were even more submerged. The market price turned upward, and the high price was seen at 34.8 yuan on July 29th. Entering autumn, the weather was clear, and the cotton development in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces was healthy. The US government announced that the loan was changed from 1.2 to 0.9, and the world cotton market was shocked, again seeing more than 31 yuan. Later, after October, the gold market stepped up, rumors arose, and the gold bar soared. The momentum was like a raging horse, and an unprecedented peak was discovered. The cotton market soared accordingly. On November 4th, after the Ministry of Finance announced the legal tender, the market was enthusiastic and reached a boiling point. The sharpness of the rising air was like a thousand rays, breaking through the 40 yuan barrier, with a plate rising by 3 yuan. The top peak was seen at 40.09 yuan, but the delivery reached more than 90,000 dan. The delivery of such a large volume of chips was a new record after January 28th. The delivery was mostly from the Tong bang and cotton merchants, and the three US, Indian and Japanese merchants were the only ones who were healthy. The price of the last plate was 39.75 yuan, and the remaining 90,600 dan. The delivery price on the 3rd was 40 yuan, and the most popular product was Tongzhou flower, accounting for 63,000 dan.

<h3 id="e186">Securities: January Public Bonds Have Been Introduced; Bulls and Bears Seem to Be Contending; The Short Sellers Are Unwilling to Recover; The Longs Are Also Afraid to Release <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange began auctioning January 1936 futures contracts. The environmental situation is worsening, and the situation in North China is inevitably expanding. Although the strength of the bulls in the financial sector has weakened, it is still easy to manipulate to support prices, fearing that the market price will fall. Because if it does not advance, it will retreat. At this peak, the market price can easily cause a huge plunge. Most people in the market are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Those who have already shorted are in a favorable environment and are unwilling to recover. Those who have already gone long are in a difficult position and dare not release. There is a slight sense of contention. In the evening session, due to bad news, although the North Gang sold aggressively, the financial sector tried its best to support it within limits, so there was no tragic fall. The future environment is extremely favorable to the short side, and if the long side does not let go, there will be no drastic fall. The exchange announced that the January 1936 futures delivery date is set for the 31st, which is outside the Lunar New Year, which is unprecedented in previous years. Yesterday's proceedings: at the opening, the bulls were still raising prices. Numbers 33, 43, and 78 all had purchases, intending to raise prices. Numbers 4, 11, 16, 21, and 71 were all selling, intending to unload their holdings. They all got good prices, so the market price still rose by 35 cents. Zheng Liu even rose by 65 cents. In the second session, the North Gang and Number 72 continued to sell aggressively, while Number 43 still had purchases, and the market price had eased by about 23 cents. In the afternoon session, rumors were rife, and Numbers 11, 16, and 35 sold a lot, while Numbers 43, 54, and 78 supported prices on the long side. It is said that the limit of the fall was 23 cents, so except for Number 96, none of the others fell by more than 30 cents. As a result, the market price rose more than it fell, by 10 cents to 30 cents. Number 96 fell by 80 cents. The total number of transactions was about 25 million yuan. The comparison table of the results of the price increases and decreases is listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>The flour market opened flat in the morning, then became brisk, and then returned to a flat state. At the beginning, the market was soft due to the small price of foreign wheat. After the second and third sessions, due to the slight replenishment of floating shorts, there were also more bulls outside the industry pulling in, and the Jiao initially recovered by one or two cents. By the close, some of the arbitrage bulls in this month gave up. In the midst of the tense situation in North China, people's hearts were inevitably dimmed, so each month saw weakness. By the time the afternoon market opened, trading was not very smooth, and the price was hovering. The final market price for this month was 3 yuan and 9 cents, which was still stable. The morning closing price for far-term flour was one cent better, and there were no special changes after that. The floor price remains solid.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened steady in the morning, then became flat. The price of foreign wheat was reported, with no market in Chicago and about 48 cents in Canada. At the beginning of the morning, people's hearts were slightly healthy, because there were very few sellers, so it was slightly better by two or three cents. Then trading was as light as usual, and it fell back slightly. By the time the afternoon market opened, trading was better, and the market price fell slightly. Looking at the situation afterwards, with the wheat market declining, both inside and outside the industry are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and there is very little room for development. The spot wheat market remains stable. The prices are: Kaiming Guang Huai'an Wheat 5 yuan and 5 cents, Yanghe Wheat 5 yuan and 5 cents, Nansuzhou Wheat 5 yuan and 6 cents, Tiantai Wheat 4 yuan, 5 jiao and 4 cents, and Xiashi Wheat 4 yuan and 8 jiao. Fuxin took 2,500 bags. As of yesterday, the number of deliveries for this month has been more than 20 trucks, with about 30 trucks of formal deliveries.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total arrival from various gangs was more than 50 stores (more than 10,000 dan of goods in total). Most of them were thin rice, so although the thick early and other japonica rice were selling flat domestically, the market price was stable. The same was true for Du Yangjian. However, thin rice had both a surge in arrivals and the suspension of Tianjin's business, with only a few merchant gangs purchasing more than 2,000 bags, so the price uniquely fell by 1-2 jiao, turning into an average price.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were a total of 30 stores from various sources downstream. Recently, the overall market sales have been poor, and the downstream inventory has surged. Yesterday, the market's appetite was also sluggish. The price of top white japonica rice was slightly 7-8 cents. Although the retail sales of Zhongguan white japonica rice were weak, the price was fixed due to the action of hoarding households. Thin rice arrived in large quantities and sales were sluggish, and the price was short by nearly one jiao. Early rice was scarce and the price was flat. The price of Yangbu Jian was stable. Although the sales of Ke Jian were sluggish, the merchants' intentions were firm, and the price was stable.</p>
<p>(Merchant Xian) Arrivals continue to surge, with more and more new arrivals from Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. After Jiangxi brown rice arrived at the port, there was a strong intention to quickly sell it off following the market. However, the merchant hoarders did not move, and people's hearts and the market were both tired. When the market opened in the morning, the appetite of this street was still good, and the market was also stable. Then the merchant traders devalued, and each store cut prices by 3-5 cents. A total of 780 bags of Jiangxi rice, 500 bags of Hunan rice, 800 bags of Fujian rice, 171 bags of Jingxian rice, and more than 1,000 bags of various Zhejiang rice were sold by this street. Hoarding households are still watching due to the situation. The North Gang is only loading the existing rice, and new transactions must also be slowed down. The inventory of foreign rice is depleted, and the market price is firm. Yesterday, 316 bags of Xiaojiao and Siam rice were opened, and the price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Foreign-Grown Sesame Seeds Sell Well and Prices Rise <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jardine Matheson and Mitsui both had appetites for foreign-grown sesame seeds, so the market atmosphere recovered, and prices turned better by 2 jiao compared to the previous day, opening at 11 yuan and 7 jiao. 700 tons were traded. The spot price of raw sesame was therefore also stable, and trading saw a sharp increase. It is estimated that there are more than 800 bags of Kaimingguang sesame, more than 1,000 bags of Suixi Kou sesame, 500 bags of Haizhou sesame, more than 400 bags of Guzhen sesame, 400 bags of Bengbu sesame, 160 bags of Jiujiang sesame, 150 bags of Yangzhou sesame, 100 bags of Taizhou sesame, 85 bags of Wuhu sesame, 450 bags of Yingzhou strip sesame, and more than 500 bags of Central Road yellow sesame.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was slightly stable, and the price of domestically produced red sugar rose again due to the excessive decline. The association divided 24 bags of rough sand white spot goods at 21 yuan and 8 jiao, and the entrepot goods at 6 yuan and 9 jiao, but none were traded. The price of the Bencun Mian Bai Zhenji No. 1 was 11 yuan and 9 jiao. The number of transactions in the Jingye Cooperative Company's bid exchange was still limited, with 2,460 bags of Wuyang Yue rough white at 11.8 yuan, a decrease of 5 cents, and 100 bags were traded. The remaining No. 2 Eryang Mian Bai was 21 yuan and 5 cents, and No. 4 was 20 yuan, 8 jiao and a half, all down 5 cents. The entrepot Dutch rough white was 6 yuan and 9 jiao, and all lacked buyers. The listing had the Guangzhou Gang open a large batch of 2,000 boxes of sliced green sugar, with a price of 8.5 yuan. The Jian Gang also had a small number of followers, which was about 2 yuan lower than the previous listing. More than 100 bags of newly arrived turned-red sugar were opened, with a price of 12 yuan and 6-7 jiao, an increase of 1 yuan compared to the previous listing. Judging from the phenomenon of Qingchi sugar prices, it has reached a considerable point and can be expected to stabilize.</p>

<p>1,000-plus boxes of Quanzhou longan, imported yesterday by the Huaping Wheel, have been shipped. Most of them are new goods, and the costs are high. Another 1,294 pieces of red and white sugar have arrived.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market's going-out was slightly more lively. Yingzhuang Jardine Matheson Foreign Company, Jin Hu Cong, Baochang Yongxing and other firms had sparse purchases of needle eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan Tunxi and other places. Transactions were not lonely. However, sales listings were one or two yuan lower than before. There was no progress in the going-out of Zhenmei Pearl Tea and other goods. Although various foreign companies sent out many telegrams for high-end Zhenmei, there were very few replies, and the market was still depressed. Sales in Ninghang and other places are particularly smooth.</p>

<p>Woolen fabric, which was popular ten years ago, was used for travelers' and hunting gear. Afterwards, sales gradually declined. Except for Westerners still buying it for manufacturing, Chinese people rarely prepared to wear it, leading to a large shortage of imports. Suddenly, this autumn, it became popular again. Chinese people choose to wear it with Western-style suits, and sales have suddenly become active. Currently, 4 yuan and 5 yuan woolen fabric has a wider sales base in Ninghang and other places. The reason for its revival is due to the popularity and strong sales of new dot-print woolens and Hailishi last year. Yesterday, the new suits of woolens, with a full set of three pieces for jackets, vests, and pants, were priced by various Western clothing stores at 26.7 yuan to 30 yuan. The market price fell by two or three cents.</p>

<p>Recently, new arrivals of local white iron are abundant, but there are very few sales. Due to the chaotic situation on the Xiaobei Road, sales have been greatly reduced. In the Yangtze River area, due to tight money, purchasing power is still limited. Sales in Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places are also sluggish. Therefore, the overall market situation is unusually sluggish. Because traders are eager to sell off, the current market price is 1 yuan and 2 cents per sheet for 36-inch sheets, a decrease of 3 cents from before. The price of 37-inch sheets is 1 yuan, 2 jiao and 4 cents per sheet, also a small decrease of two or three cents from before. It is reported that only 1,400-1,500 sheets have been traded in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Investigation: The Rise and Fall of the Financial Industry in Wuxi <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The financial power of Wuxi has always been in the hands of money shops. The main targets of money shop loans are the silk and rice industries. During the heyday of the silk factory industry in 1929, there were a total of 56 silk factories in the county, with more than 20,000 silk machines and nearly 100,000 workers. With the development of the silk industry, the number of money shops also increased. Within two years, the number of money shops increased from ten to twenty. Loans to the silk industry were very generous. At that time, there were only a few banks in Wuxi, such as China Communications, Shanghai, and Jiangsu. The China Communications and other banks were specializing in issuing banknotes. Although Jiangsu and Shanghai also made loans for silk cocoons, the number was very small.</p>
<p>In 1931, the overseas silk market fell sharply. The silk factories in Wuxi had a mountain of accumulated silk and suffered huge losses. About 30 silk factories went bankrupt one after another. As a result, every money shop suffered bad debts, ranging from 12,000 to more than 100,000 yuan. The money industry suffered such a major blow, and its vitality was greatly damaged. As a result, the newly established money shops also went bankrupt one after another. Last spring, the Baokangrun Money Shop, which had strong financial resources, could not maintain itself and announced liquidation. Up to this year, there are only nine exchange money shops in the county: Ruichangrun, Fuyu, Fuyuan, Shenyu, Yonghengfeng, Yuanfengren, Deji, Fuchangsheng, and Yunyu.</p>
<p>Wuxi is a well-known lending port. In addition to lending in the silk market, the most important thing is lending in the rice industry. There are more than 120 large and small rice shops in the county. The amount of loans often reaches more than 10 million yuan in the summer and winter seasons. The money industry has suffered deep trauma and no longer has the ability to operate large-scale loans. At the same time, it does not dare to lend easily. Therefore, the four banks, China Communications, Shanghai, and Jiangsu, took the opportunity to lend in large quantities, because rice industry loans have goods as collateral and profits are guaranteed, so why not the banking industry? In this way, a large part of the money shops' business was taken away by the banks. Therefore, in the past three years, various banks in Shanghai have set up branches in Wuxi to issue banknotes and operate loans. Competition among peers is fierce. The three banks, China, Communications, and Jiangsu, have built their own warehouses to specialize in rice and grain loans. Now there are a total of ten banks in Wuxi: China, Communications, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Continental, Zhongnan, Farmers, and Commercial. Shanghai Xinhua Bank has set up an office in Dangkou Town in the Eighth District, specializing in rural loans. Shanghai Bank has set up a branch office in the urban area, specializing in attracting household deposits.</p>
<p>On the surface, Wuxi's financial industry has been replaced by the banking industry (the money industry). But what is the truth? Although the number of banks is increasing, is the business of the banks expanding proportionally? This has become a question. Wuxi's rice industry has been affected by the dumping of foreign rice and foreign wheat in recent years, and most of them have found it difficult to survive. Last winter, due to the famine, the business of each rice shop was even more desolate. Other industries such as textiles, silk cloth, and foreign goods have all declined uniformly. The targets of bank loans were so depressed last year and this year. Can the banks themselves still be prosperous?</p>
<p>This spring, there were huge waves in the Shanghai financial industry, and the Wuxi financial industry was also greatly affected. Banks and money shops tightened loans, and almost everyone was unwilling to operate spring cocoon loans. The released cocoon loans were only 2 million yuan, which is less than one-tenth compared to five years ago. When Qiuerdeng entered the market, the silk market soared. The silver and money industry learned from the previous lessons and still dared not lend in large quantities. It was really too steady. Now that the new rice is on the market, the banks and money shops are still adhering to a tight policy and are unwilling to lend easily. The industrial and commercial market is showing a more desolate situation. If this continues without devising an appropriate good strategy, I don't know what the future of the financial industry will be. (Jian Qing)</p>

<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Autumn is gone, and winter is coming. The weather is getting colder. To dispel the cold and warm up, the stove is still the choice. However, if the indoor temperature is too high, it is not suitable for hygiene. The suitable indoor temperature is listed below for those who pay attention to hygiene to refer to.</p>
<p>(1) Living room - 18 to 20 degrees.</p>
<p>(2) Bedroom - 13 to 15 degrees.</p>
<p>(3) Children's room - 20 to 22 degrees.</p>
<p>(4) Sickroom - 16 to 20 degrees. (But it depends on the condition of the disease and cannot be generalized.)</p>
<p>(5) Nude - 25 to 26 degrees.</p>
<p>(Note: The degrees listed on the right are in Celsius. The conversion method with Fahrenheit and Réaumur is as follows.</p>
<p>Celsius = Réaumur × 5 ÷ 4</p>
<p>(Celsius 132) × 9 ÷ 5 = Fahrenheit</p>

<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Endocrine is the most precious nutrient for human nerves. If the endocrine is disordered or abnormal, it will cause neurasthenia and present various deficiency symptoms. Injecting endocrine preparations of reproductive hormones often yields the most satisfactory results. Therefore, famous doctors commonly use it.</p>
<p>The patient, Zheng Shengyou, suffered from severe neurasthenia. His limbs were cold and his body trembled. He had palpitations and night sweats. His skin lost its elasticity, became loose, and showed aging wrinkles. This summer, he came to me for treatment. After I injected a large amount of "reproductive hormones", the endocrine system returned to normal. The nerves suddenly became healthy. The past ailments were miraculously cured. Even though the weather suddenly turned cold, he no longer felt afraid of the cold.</p>

<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>There are many patients with the disease of nocturnal emission. Prolonged and untreated, it can cause sperm depletion, brain weakness, kidney deficiency, and back pain. It is difficult to hope for offspring. The treatment method should be both symptomatic and root cause. Those who have taken other medicines and have not been effective can pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Shi, committed masturbation when he was young, which led to the disease of nocturnal emission. After marriage, he had kidney deficiency and thin sperm and was unable to have children. This spring, due to the increase in his ailments, he began to seek treatment from me. I immediately treated both the symptoms and the root cause. I instructed him to purchase Ximitu's sperm-strengthening tablets from the Sino-British Pharmacy to treat his nocturnal emission and to take reproductive hormones to replenish his deficiencies. After taking half a dozen, he immediately felt strong sperm and strength, and the nocturnal emission was completely cured. This autumn, Mr. Shi introduced his younger brother to treat his stomach disease. During the conversation, I learned that his wife was already pregnant.</p>

<p>— Contributed by Huangfu Da</p>
<p>Because my body is weak, I must choose to take supplements every winter to replenish my body. This has become a habit. However, for several years, the supplements I have taken have all been ineffective and difficult to satisfy. Last winter, I was introduced by a relative to take Stanna's reproductive hormones. The effect was unusually amazing. Not only did I gain weight and have plump muscles, but I also felt refreshed and energetic as never before. Since taking supplements, I have never been as satisfied as with reproductive hormones. Now that winter is approaching, it is the time for winter supplementation. As for me, I am already strong and healthy and do not need to take supplements again. Therefore, I introduced it to many friends, and they all showed great effects. Therefore, I wrote this article to inform those who want to take winter supplements.</p>

<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Nineteen out of ten women suffer from leucorrhea. They only hide it and keep it secret, which leads to prolonged and untreated illness, body weakness, loss of health, and hopelessness for offspring. It is indeed regrettable. The treatment method is to use "Liaodailing" externally. It has two major characteristics: one is that the method is simple and straightforward, and the other is that it can be secretly treated by oneself. Therefore, it is most suitable for women's environment. It is indeed the lucky star of women.</p>
<p>The patient, Mrs. Ren Kong, suffered from spontaneous leucorrhea for five or six years. She secretly did not treat it, and it gradually became red leucorrhea. The disease became more severe, and she was so depleted that she could hardly support herself. This summer, she was introduced by her relative, Mrs. Wu, to come to me for diagnosis and treatment. In addition to prescribing "Female Reproductive Hormones" for her to take internally, I also instructed her to purchase "Liaodailing" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy and treat herself according to the method. The leucorrhea went from thin to stopping. Just after finishing one box, it was completely cured. Taking "Female Reproductive Hormones" made her feel stronger, healthier, and more beautiful, and her menstrual irregularities were also cured at the same time.</p>
<p>(Note) Female reproductive hormones are a good medicine for women to regulate menstruation, treat leucorrhea, treat diseases, and strengthen the body. You can purchase and take them directly from the pharmaceutical department of Anlisi Foreign Company. Shanghai Sino-Western Pharmacy, Huamei Pharmacy, and Yong'an Company's Western Medicine Department also sell them.</p>

<p>— Contributed by Qiu Song'e</p>
<p>My uncle suffered from weakness and many illnesses, which led to smoking addiction. For ten years, he has failed to quit three times. During the quitting period, stomach pain, nocturnal emission, and other symptoms occurred in clusters, which led to halfway abandonment. Now, because the government is determined to eradicate drugs and the laws are strict, he has to visit famous doctors everywhere to seek a method to eliminate pain during the smoking cessation period. Later, Physician Zhan Nianceng instructed him to purchase Weitongling and Ximitu's sperm-strengthening tablets from the Sino-Western Pharmacy to separately treat stomach problems and long-term nocturnal emission, and to take reproductive hormones during the smoking cessation period to regulate his body. By advancing according to the law, the stomach pain and nocturnal emission did not occur at all, and his body was strong and his spirit was happy during the quitting period, which he had never expected before.</p>

<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Luo Huaiqing, had a weak stomach and was often disgusted by food. Digestion was also poor. He often suffered from food stagnation and stomach sluggishness. He repeatedly took various stomach medicines, but they only worked temporarily and were difficult to achieve complete success. Therefore, he regarded it as an incurable chronic disease and delayed himself. This summer, because he heard personally that his close relative, Mr. Zhou Dingzhong, had gastrointestinal diseases and was cured by me using "Weitongling", he also came to me for treatment. After I told him that his ailments were different from Mr. Zhou's. Mr. Zhou had symptoms such as gastritis and stomach pain, so I prescribed "Weitongling" as the main prescription. However, Mr. Luo's ailment was completely caused by stomach weakness. I prescribed a prescription instructing him to purchase "Jianweisu" from the Huamei Pharmacy. After taking it for three consecutive days, the accumulated food was completely digested. After taking it for several consecutive days, his appetite was strong. After finishing three boxes, he felt that his stomach was strong and key, and had the potential to digest stones and eggs.</p>

<p>Young men, with their blood and qi vigorous and unrestrained, are prone to impulsiveness. They may mistakenly engage in masturbation or excessive sexual activity, often suffering from ailments such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. The treatment method should involve, on the one hand, calming the mind and restraining desires, nourishing the body through diet and hygiene. As for the selection of medication, it is imperative to consult a physician for appropriate prescription based on the specific condition. Misuse of drying, harsh, or stimulating agents can be detrimental to the body and should be avoided.</p>
<p>Patient Li Deyuan, from Suzhou, due to excessive indulgence, suffered from weakened seminal vesicles, leading to nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. He had tried various tonics on his own but was unable to achieve a complete cure. This spring, he sought treatment from me. I used "Simito's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to cure his nocturnal emission and "Spermin" to cure his premature ejaculation, enabling him to regain his health. In early autumn, he introduced his brother-in-law to me for treatment of nocturnal emission. According to him, within three to four months, the nocturnal emission was completely eradicated, and the premature ejaculation was also completely cured. He repeatedly expressed his gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Saving the Nation Through Buddhist Ceremony <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The Vajra Dharma Assembly has been held twice in the past, once in Beiping and once in Hangzhou. These days, a White Umbrella Cover Pacifying Disaster Dharma Assembly is being held here, which is truly grand. It is said that the initiators, in view of the increasing demonic influence and the many misfortunes of the country, in order to eliminate the calamities, specially invited the Panchen Lama's representative, Rongzeng Master from Tibet, and Mongolian and Tibetan eminent monks to hold the Dharma Assembly for three days, hoping to rely on the power of the Buddha to escape the crisis. This is considered saving the nation through Dharma Assembly.</p>
<p>To solve the nation's worries, one should make efforts in a rational way to be effective. Using Dharma Assembly to salvage the misfortunes, the intention may not be criticized, but the action is inevitably eccentric. In order to correct social perceptions, it is also necessary to criticize it. It must be known that saving the nation is a difficult task, relying entirely on strength, and must not have any fluke. The behavior of seeking gods and entrusting Buddha is not what we should have. If Dharma Assembly can eliminate disasters and difficulties, it is the most powerful treasure. Our national crisis, just invite a few masters to perform the Dharma, can deal with it, what else do we need saving the nation movement?</p>
<p>The Vajra Dharma Assembly in the past was presided over by the Living Buddha Panchen Lama, which was not a sensation. But the result was just wasted money. Not long ago, the Pope of Rome led the world's Catholics to pray for peace for three days. In the end, it could not eliminate the massacre in East Africa.</p>
<p>Here, we advise the general public who are "determined to save the nation" that if you have the heart to save the nation, everyone should do their best. Otherwise, no matter how great the Dharma is, I am afraid it will not be enough to save our calamity.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Guangzhou in Winter <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Muxian</p>
<p>Winter seems to be unrelated to the southern country. For example, now, it should be the season of falling leaves and frost everywhere in the north and south of the Yangtze River. However, the grass and trees in the south are still so green and lovely, the women are still wearing cicada-winged summer clothes, and the swimming pools in Dongshan and Xijiao are relatively deserted. But there are still many young people showing off their power, and the ball-like banyan trees are still full of thick shade, arranged neatly there in the long embankment. It is the season when azaleas are in full bloom in the southern country, and the clacking sound of the nanny's wooden sandals is loud. The warm sun shines on the female students wearing blue plaid cloth skirts. Who dares to say it is winter?</p>
<p>Counting up, it has been eight years since I spent winter in Guangzhou. If there is no special reason this year, I believe that the opportunity to avoid the cold in the south will not be lost anyway.</p>
<p>The kapok on Yuexiu Mountain is probably about to bloom, right? Those bright red flowers are sparsely hanging on the thick branches, definitely not as graceful as wintersweet, and even less as delicate and beautiful as peach blossoms. The temperament is just like a Confucian general with literary grace and elegance. No wonder kapok has another alias of hero tree.</p>
<p>Although Lychee Bay is deserted. But those who like tranquility and quietness may as well invite three or five close friends to hire a boat to float in the middle of the stream, listening to the singing of the yellow orioles on both sides. Or stretch your neck and breathe in the fresh air unique to the suburbs? This leisurely life will bring so many romantic atmospheres!</p>
<p>On the streets, there are also flags of winter discounts fluttering in the wind, and lottery tickets (one type of fortune tickets) fly all over the streets like paper money. Chaozhou oranges are on the market. Those bowl-sized oranges will make your mouth water. Maybe there are one or two Liangxiang ticket shops on the most bustling road. To embellish a little, that pungent smell will make you sneeze. The radio in the foreign goods store emits that discordant Cantonese music, which makes people very impatient. There is a burst of rough gong sound in the teahouse. A stench of opium smoke may float out from a small alley, making you very sad.</p>
<p>The Pearl River Bridge, like a giant, spans the turbulent rapids. Ant-like pedestrians are crowded on the bridge. Many pale faces showed hurried expressions. Among them, there are naturally fewer gamblers who rush to "Fantan Halls" and addicts who go to "Talk Shops."</p>
<p>After crossing the bridge, the Henan Island, which is called the Monte Carlo of the East, appears in front of you. The big words of "Yutai Company Upstairs Silver Plate" first pull your footsteps tight. Batches of gamblers with slumped faces and suffering from a psychological illness of luck came out of that narrow door, and batches of people with too much hope rushed in. Although I did not mix in it, this Oriental Monte Carlo hurt my heart after all.</p>
<p>It will never be as desolate and cold as a winter night in the north. At midnight, you can still see the dazzling neon lights. Teahouses, restaurants, etc. are still so lively. If you are interested, you may as well go to the teahouse that hires female entertainers to sing to while away the time.</p>
<p>The sound of wooden clogs at midnight awakens people's dreams. The hawker selling wontons is knocking on the bamboo clapper, the sound is so clear and sharp, and there is no northwest wind raging, even if you are only wearing a single coat, you will not shiver. How lovely is the southern country! I would like to spend every winter in your arms.</p>

<p>That night, the stars and the moon also lost their light, and the entire universe was just a black mass. It was difficult for them to be gods in this niche again. They were going to create new light and new warmth. The five goddesses quietly disappeared on the sea behind the tower, farewell to the black universe.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Person Who Strings Willow Leaves <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>When a thin layer of ice begins to form in the water tanks of the northern country, our young people have work to do.</p>
<p>In the rural areas of our hometown, you can see tall poplars everywhere. Poplar is a tall deciduous tree. Every spring, when it starts to sprout, it will drop a kind of "poplar grub" that looks like a caterpillar; in spring, young children use their frozen red hands to pick them up. While singing songs with other partners, they pick them into small baskets; when a small basket is full, they send it to the old grandmother who is sitting not far away from the crowd and doing living. She always takes it kindly and pours it into the prepared cloth bag. Then go back and pick again. In autumn, the willow leaves fall again, and we come to string them again.</p>
<p>Because the willow leaves are pieces, so big and cute, it is not appropriate to pick them up by hand, so we come to string them. The method of stringing is to use a bamboo needle (or iron needle) with a long rope strung on the tail, and a block at the end of the rope. In this way, use the needle to string the willow leaves all over the ground, string them full, put them on the rope, string them full, put them on the rope, and wait until the rope is full, then drag this long string home. Sometimes, I bring a few more ropes, and string this one full and then string that one.</p>
<p>When we walk into the house of the old grandmother, these things are often hung on his walls.</p>
<p>In order to study, I lived in the city most of the time. In autumn, spring holidays, and the "wheat holiday" specially given to older students, I lived in the countryside. I followed, in the fields, in the woods, watching those wave-like wheat, the round apricots, pears, peaches, followed by fat to thin, from thin to fat cattle, horses, and other livestock. I learned a lot of knowledge from those people that I learned in school.</p>
<p>But what I will never forget are those people who strung willow leaves together.</p>
<p>These people, now recalling them, are somewhat vague. However, when I see them, I am still very affectionate, but they have been crushed by life and no longer have the joy of the past. And the former partners, some have become mothers, some have been sold as commodities, some are still following behind the tails of cows, supporting the plow, and some have run to the city like me. What I got in the city was starvation and cold that came before death. They are suffering from salary cuts, layoffs, unemployment, ... oppression, struggling on the lifeline. Like those who are still in the fields, they are just suffering from two forms of oppression.</p>
<p>Some time ago, I met one of those partners. His physique was much taller than mine. In childhood, whether it was stringing willow leaves or picking up "poplar grubs," he always achieved the best results. Five years ago, he transferred home from Jilin and ran to the city again.</p>
<p>When the waves of the Huangpu River angrily hit the dock, he was there, he was working there "Hengyo, Hengyo."</p>
<p>He told me the pain of life and gave me many inspirations.</p>
<p>He waved his arm with the black bird's feathers on it, as if facing his partner, and said to me: "What you said is right: Can you still endure hardship for a lifetime?..." When his arm was raised, I seemed to see the sea waves that were about to destroy this world, rushing towards the rocks of the world.</p>
<p>He said, "There are many people who string willow leaves." Then he told me who had died and who had been shot by whom there. He was very clear. He could tell me those difficult-to-remember years and days. It was as if his brain was full of things about his partners.</p>
<p>Now, it is time to string willow leaves again, but I am wandering in a foreign country thousands of miles away, expressing infinite respect to this former partner on the one hand, and missing those who were more official on the other hand.</p>

<p>Once it gets dark, the west wind blows loudly, and people in thin jackets can't help but shiver. The wind howls past in the gaps between the wires in the air, and sparse pedestrians tap the streets unevenly with their feet: "Tap, tap, tap...", in the distance, the street lights gradually become denser, and the machines in the factory spit the sound of breathing out, rising and falling vaguely and rhythmically.</p>
<p>A thin and strangely shaped shadow is projected on the deserted street by the street lamp in front. Wang Dagezi, with a feverish brain and a tongue dulled by being soaked in shochu, walks crookedly along the "foreign-style houses" by the road. Then, suddenly, he stops at a narrow doorway and pounds on the door hurriedly and violently.</p>
<p>"Ah Lin, open the door, Ah Lin, open the door! Damn you..."</p>
<p>Unclear, acid-smelling shochu-flavored words spew out like pouring, and then, with a snap, the small door opens, and a tall body blocks the door, filling the door frame.</p>
<p>"Who?... You? What do you want? What do you want!"</p>
<p>"What do I want? Don't be kidding, right? The money you lost in the gambling den the other day, are you still planning to pay it back? You say! Tell me honestly!"</p>
<p>"Speak a little clearer! What gambling den are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Hum, hum, hum" Wang Dagezi squeezed a string of terrible sounds from his throat: "Friend... Boss, don't be kidding, right? Three yuan and four cents, won in your gambling den! Waiting to live a life! You also lost a lot in your gambling den, Boss, didn't you?" (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e212">Misty Fine Vistas <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>The Misty Peak is shrouded in milky white morning mist, and the rising sun is reflected on the mountain peak, faintly revealing a blurred outline. Looking up from the Zhenxia Harbor, it is as if a young woman with newly applied rouge stands under a piece of blue satin; the sun gradually rises, and the golden color slowly fades.</p>
<p>Junping and I sat separately in two rickshaws and headed towards Luohan Weir; but the high and low, rugged mountain roads shook us sitting in the cars so much that our hearts almost turned over. Sometimes, when passing between rice paddies, or beside ponds, or streams, we would feel a burst of fear in our hearts, fearing that the car and people would fall into the rice paddies and ponds together.</p>
<p>With a uneasy heart, the car turned a few corners, and after passing Shangjian Bridge, we could see a Wenchang Pavilion.</p>
<p>Tung seeds fell from the tree with a crackling sound, and the leaves all turned withered yellow, and only a few withered leaves were flying in the air. The dilapidated Wenchang Pavilion has now been converted into a private primary school, and the open space in front of the door is probably the primary school's playground.</p>
<p>After walking a few more steps, the car could no longer be pulled in. We gave the car fare and walked along a stone path overgrown with short pine trees. Leather shoes rubbed against the sand, making a crackling sound. The weather in late autumn was so sunny and mild that after running a few steps, I felt hot all over; the sweat on my forehead was dripping like water leaking from the eaves. I took off my woolen hat and wiped the sweat with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>"It's really hot!" I stood and exhaled a sigh of relief, Junping just smiled and said nothing.</p>
<p>We squatted under a bayberry tree to rest, and a breeze brought a bit of light coolness. The clear and loud sound of a waterfall was sent out from the nearby valley, so we followed the sound and looked for it in a small path of chestnut trees. Walking along a small stream for more than ten steps, we saw two huge stone slabs, and the waterfall, which was like a piece of silk and hung upside down like a silver river, rushed straight down from above, and then was received by the stone slabs below into a clear and deep pool, stirring up water flowers like broken silver. The water was so clear and lovely that the pebbles at the bottom of the stream could be counted one by one.</p>
<p>"That is the Battle Stone Slab. The sound of the waterfall here in the plum season is like thunder." I held the rushing waterfall with my hands, and the water droplets splashed on my face.</p>
<p>Junping took off his shoes and socks, wanting to soak his feet in this clear spring, but the water was too cold, so he quickly retracted his feet as soon as he stretched them down: "Too cold, can't stand it!"</p>
<p>There are many stone gaps left on the stone slabs next to it, and there is still charcoal ash in the gaps; that is the traces of tourists coming here to cook spring water and drink tea.</p>
<p>Several country women were squatting in the thatch bushes on the hillside of Zhuwu Ridge, cutting firewood. When they heard our leather shoes, they stopped working and stood up at the same time, looking at us with suspicious eyes.</p>
<p>The soles of our leather shoes stepped on the winding brick mountain road, and there was often the danger of slipping. We could only stoop our waists and climb upwards. When we climbed to the highest peak of Zhuwu Ridge, both of us were panting, sweating profusely. Looking up at the top of the Misty Peak, it was still half as high.</p>
<p>There was a narrow path to the west, winding straight upwards. We wiped the sweat from our faces, stretched our waists, and continued to climb upwards from that path.</p>
<p>There is a teahouse on the top of Misty Peak, with a stone-carved tea jar inside, which Hao is used by the villagers to provide tea in summer. Because this is the only way to go north and south of the mountain, there are many people who come and go every day, and that teahouse is the only resting place for pedestrians. This is truly an oasis in the desert in summer.</p>
<p>Standing on the top of the peak and looking around, you can overlook the entire Taihu Lake scenery. 36,000 hectares of vastness, 72 strange peaks of Dongting, all the lake and mountain scenery are taken into view, and the outlines of two provinces and three prefectures rise and fall in the sparkling waves of thousands of miles.</p>

<p>In the film "Spring Flower" directed by Wu Cun, in addition to "Spring Flower", which is sung by Yan Yuexian and others, there is also a song "Could it be the Fragrance of Wild Flowers", which will be sung by Miss Gu Lanjun, the heroine of the play within a play.</p>
<p>Could it be the fragrance of wild flowers, lingering in a foreign land. But the autumn moon is bright, coldly and clearly shining on the empty room. Since we parted, my beauty has faded, half thinking of you, half annoyed at you. When will we be together again, to tell the sorrows of parting. Blame him for being too absurd, failing to cherish the good night, breaking my heart. The more I think, the more I want to think, I am so pitiful, as if drunk and crazy. I ask you, how can you bear to abandon your loyal wife, raising the tray is like Meng Guang and Liang Hong. Don't be in love with the fragrance of wild flowers, wild flowers are not as fragrant as home flowers.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Sudden Change"</p>
<p>The sky is clear, the wind is light, and the air is refreshing. A few lines of new geese fly across the sky. The busy servant Gao Lishi sweeps the imperial garden with great effort. The autumn scenery in the inner garden is endless. Lotus leaves are everywhere in the ponds. Soon, it is reported that Emperor Ming has arrived, with the favored Consort Yang supported on either side. Countless osmanthus flowers are fragrant. Sometimes parrots call to each other. The imperial banquet is laid out on the flower pavilion. Delicacies from the sea and mountains fill the table.</p>
<p>A jade hand holds a golden pot. The emperor taps the beat, the consort sings. The Rainbow Skirt Dance is unparalleled in the world. Consort Yang kneels and presents three cups of wine. The emperor happily holds her hand. Consort Yang falls drunk, like a painting of a begonia in spring slumber. Her drunken state is even more enchanting. Who knew that joy would turn to sorrow. It is said that An Lushan's rebellion is in full swing. What can be done about the capital? The Tang Dynasty has been at peace for too long. The civil and military officials are unable to defend against the enemy. The six armies are quickly ordered to protect the emperor. The carriages and horses rush along the long road. Temporarily avoiding the flames of war, they are lucky to go to Shu. Alas, the woman is as delicate as a flower. Her jade is shattered, her fragrance extinguished, a piece of silk. She is forced to commit suicide at Mawei Slope.</p>

<p>"The Grace of a Beauty"</p>
<p>Hong Shiyi was too deeply stimulated. The more he thought about it, the more upset he became. He grabbed a kitchen knife and went straight to Chang's house. Who knew that things would go wrong, and he was seen by the police. Hong Shiyi was arrested and taken to the district. Fortunately, Chang Xiaonan went to the district and bailed Hong Shiyi out.</p>

The number of pages in this issue has been increased to forty, and the content is extremely rich. The selling price remains the same.</p>
<p>The Lanman Yishe is a singing group of several young ladies from ×× Girls' High School who love singing. Unexpectedly, a major reporter, Wu, sent a letter to the school, and the school considered it related to morals, and gave each person a major demerit and notified their parents, which made them cry out in pain.</p>
<p>Bai Na and Xu Xuan have withdrawn from the Yi Wu Society.</p>
<p>The General Affairs Office of the Singing Art Association has moved to Room 6, No. 49 Sichuan Road, telephone 10052.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>"Boatman's Daughter" was previewed at the Jincheng Grand Theater at ten o'clock yesterday morning. The dubbing of the film is very good, especially the song "The Merry Widow". The standard beauty Xu Lai is indeed as someone said, has never done so well. However, she should "add some business acumen", does "Monster" agree?</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei doesn't seem to have made a good movie since joining Mingyi Star. "Boatman" is also mediocre.</p>
<p>Wang Jiting's "Planting Lotus Flowers by the West Lake" is a very good performance.</p>
<p>It is said that Xu Lai originally had a "standard" shot, but it was not filmed for some reason. (Not cut)</p>
<p>"Yi Hai" stated: The Great China Food Company "Three Times Invites Yuan Meiyun", the entire segment of "Ming Shen Tou Ci Tang" is exceptionally round and moist, resounding like floating clouds. Listeners are undoubtedly addicted. Although Yuan Meiyun came from "Xi Long You Feng", she is now filming "The Night of the Wedding Candle", and has recently been honored as the "Standard Female Concubine", so it is appropriate to "invite three times".</p>
<p>Some people find it strange that they searched all the newsstands yesterday and there was no "Movie Fan Weekly" published. It was all due to printing problems, and it was postponed to Sunday to be resurrected. The newspaper is destined to have bad luck!</p>
<p>Today I did not follow someone's instructions to "scribble", I apologize deeply. When I have the opportunity, I will "scribble"!</p>

<p>(1) "Sea Hawk" Released</p>
<p>"Sea Hawk" (Drake of England), released today at the Cathay Grand Theater, is a magnificent historical naval battle film, narrating a page of miracles of the British national hero Drake in the late sixteenth century. Drake rose from a pirate to become a British naval admiral. The ministers in the court were all against his combat plan, but only Queen Elizabeth could deeply understand his ideas. Later, Drake indeed defeated the Spanish army and added a glorious page to the history of the British navy in Europe. There is a fire attack scene in the film, in which the burning ship rushes into the enemy fleet with the momentum of the wind, which is extremely shocking.</p>
<p>(2) "Here's To Romance" is a Box Office Success</p>
<p>"Here's To Romance", starring the opera master of the contemporary era, Nino Martini, has been extremely crowded since its premiere at the Grand Cathay Theater the day before yesterday. This is because the plot of the film is not only lingering and poignant, but Martini's singing voice is indeed divine, with a roundabout and lingering taste. There is also the "Swan Dance" starring the dance star Maria and the Gypsy dance by the Spanish dance king Ascortai Lu, which are not easy to see on the screen and are worth watching.</p>
<p>(3) "Wings Over Ethiopia" is Coming Soon</p>
<p>At this time when the situation in Ethiopia is extremely tense, this movie screen "Wings Over Ethiopia" is bound to be worth our attention. In this film, it thoroughly exposes the customs of Ethiopia. King Haile Selassie is no less than the protagonist of the film. The exercise of the latest tactics by the Lion King's army and the air defense equipment of Ethiopia are all reflected on the screen, which is a refreshing experience for the audience. It is said that this film will be released soon at the Grand Cathay.</p>
<p>(4) "The 39 Steps" Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The big star Robert Donat has gained great fame since the release of "The Count of Monte Cristo", but so far there have been no new works released, and there are quite a few fans who are eagerly awaiting him. Now, his new work "The 39 Steps" has arrived in Shanghai and will be released in Shanghai soon. In this film, not only is the structure ingenious everywhere, but Robert Donat's acting skills are even better than in "The Count of Monte Cristo". It is indeed a rare work to see. The heroine is Marlene Carroll, the protagonist of "Rose Marie" and "The Scarlet Empress", and the director of this film is Hitchcock, the director of "The Lodger".</p>
<h3 id="e222">"Hero of the Hour" to be Released Soon <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yi Hua Company's latest and most valuable production, the all-dialogue sound singing film "Hero of the Hour", under the clamor of the world, has decided to meet the audiences who support it in the first-class theaters in this city and other cities in the near future. Regarding the organization of this film, and other aspects, director Ying Yunwei already has the ambition to show it to the foreign film fans, so there is no doubt that he has achieved satisfactory results. At the same time, the day of its release can resonate for a while, and give the Chinese film industry a fierce impulse and fresh stimulation, which is also expected.</p>
