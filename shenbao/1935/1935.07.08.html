<h3>長江水患與水利建設</h3>
<p>— 冉</p>
<p>旬日以來。報章紛傳長江水位盛漲。沿江各埠漸呈險象。最近消息。漢口上下游水位。已超過二十年洪水之紀錄。皖贛沿江各縣鎭街道多已淹水。京市下關江水距堤岸祗差尺許。各地軍政長官出發巡視堤防。督率負責機關。積極進行搶險防汛工程。此次長江水患。對於民生國計。至有關係。固不待言而喻也。</p>
<p>凡稍具地理常識者莫不知　長江源遠流長。水勢平順。富灌溉航運之利。有我國大動脈之稱。非若黃河流急沙多。時虞汜濫。夙為民生大患也。孰意近數年來。頗擅水利之長江。竟亦有繼黃河而重苦我民之勢耶。此天之不佑我國歟。抑人謀之不臧歟。</p>
<p>夫夏令多雨。江河水盛。固天時之常也。偶因霪雨不止。山洪暴發。致河水陡漲。淹沒城市。猶可諉為天災。今於四五年之間。屢受大水威脅。祗見臨事張皇應。付平時鮮注意於經常之設備。直可謂之人禍矣。「洪水」一詞。常用以形容危害民衆之可怖現象。吾人對此召致洪水可怖之人禍。焉容忍心坐視。而不圖根本救治之法乎。</p>
<p>根本救治長江水患之方法無他。水利建設而已。我中華以農立國。農業發達。國本斯固。欲求農業之發達。首應注意灌漑之利便。且立國於今日之世界。不可不講求工商業。欲振興工商業。又應開發航運事業。而便利灌溉。開發航運。俱有賴於水利建設。是則水利建設又為我國經濟建設亟應注意之基礎工作矣。果能上下一心。力求長江水利建設之完備。豈特重苦我民之洪水大禍可獲减免。經濟建設之前途實攸賴之。</p>
<p>長江水利建設之經營。政府本設有揚子江水利委員會主持之。徒以國家多故。經費缺乏。致無由發揮其職能。至今日水患將成。僅由經委會撥欵十萬元。以供防汛工作之所需。戔戔此數。所施工程之實效蓋可預想。而臨時救急以外。積極持久之設施。尙未聞有何計劃焉。</p>
<p>雖然。事苟公認為切要。則衆擎易舉。卽如公路之建設。以有力者之倡導。今日已有相當之成就。此經濟命脈所關之水利建設。其重要性實不亞於公路。深望全國上下急起直追。以成此百年大計也。</p>
<h3>意阿爭端　美國拒絕干涉　不啻宣吿非戰約死刑　勸告僑民趁早離阿境</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）關於美國拒不干涉意阿爭端之舉、一般人以為美國政府此種態度、共有兩種動機、（一）不願牽入漩渦、（二）希望各國終能尊重現行條約、國務院頃已授權駐阿比西尼亞代辦喬治、通知美國僑民約一百二十五名、其中傳敎士一百十人、應卽離開阿國或採取必要辦法、以保障自身安全、國務院對於此項撤退命令、不允有所說明、僅謂考慮此事、已歷兩星期之久云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間若干觀察者以為國務總理赫爾對於阿比西尼亞請求援引凱洛格公約之答覆、已將該約宣吿死刑、且此次意阿事件、已為該約第三次不能解决國際間之爭端、官塲方面私人表示、凱洛公約對於意阿爭端之效力、已完全絕望、因該約並無懲戒破壞者之規定也、政府官員尙稱彼等不知政府是否確已通知美僑離開阿境、惟謂此項手續、業已準備、當俟美國駐阿代辦相機執行、國務院稱、現在僑居阿國者、共有美籍人民一百二十五戶、其中一百十三戶為宣敎師、其餘則為外交官及商人、美國政府對於彼等之離境間題、將不用命令、而出以勸吿、惟其結果則大槪相等云、據此間消息、美僑離阿、尙宜趁早、因通至海岸之鐵道、恐不久卽將落於意人手中矣、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據阿京消息、該處美國領署曾否認命令美僑離開阿京、惟亦承認曾與領袖美僑討論退出之問題云、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約時報評論意阿爭端、謂「阿比西尼亞現狀惡劣已極、殊非白種人文明之福、至非戰公約當日本佔領中國東三省之時、卽已病在旦夕、造至此際、直已壽終正寢、」該報嗣又批評美國政府照覆阿皇之文、謂「美國一方面向阿國表示信念、謂意大利不致侵略該國、一方面乃令美國僑民離開阿境、此二事同時發生、誠屬不可思議」云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>軍火出口禁令　對意阿不能適用</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）關於意大利與阿比西尼亞之爭端、外交界人士以為當事國他日開戰時、不致向美國廠家購買彈藥、但美國政府若果遇有此種情事、實亦無力加以制止、自當請由國會通過法案、授權政府、禁北軍火出口云、（按美國對於大厦谷交戰國、卽玻利維亞與巴拉圭兩國、禁運軍火辦法、係由參議院指定範圍、特加允許、未便推行于意阿兩國、）（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日於例行報界談話時稱、阿比西尼亞之現狀、並無新發展、惟國務院則仍密切留意、同時此間觀察者因赫爾曾有表示、謂彼已請專家搜集關於向交戰國家輸出軍火之美國政策、故亦懸測英國或有發起禁運軍火之議、惟目前此種禁令、恐僅能作為一種表示、因阿意兩國向未由美國購買任何軍火云、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿請美國干涉　疑出於英方授意</h3>
<p>（羅馬）參議員達方柴蒂頃在講壇報評論阿比西尼亞問題云、「要求美國出而干涉之舉、决非阿比西尼亞國政府所能為、當係英國外務部或殖民部之發明品、觀於英國政府同時向美國政府詢問、假使意國破壞非戰公約、應否採取集體行動、加以制止、自可恍然大悟、至美國政府答復阿國之照會、未以鄭重形式出之、自屬合理、其拒絕援引非戰公約之嚴大理由、當以世界上業已發生事變之後、幷在發生事變之際、若果試騐此項公約之效力、卽以完善國家文明模範看待阿比西尼亞國、此其為事、旣已愚不可及、而又失之虛偽故也云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>東菲風雲日緊　意人士紛起請纓　首相子投効空軍照准　紅衫隊領袖自吿奮勇</h3>
<p>（羅馬）首相墨索里尼之二子維多利沃與白魯諾投効服役東菲意空軍、今日已由航空大臣照准、又以「加里波狄千人隊」留名史冊之紅衫隊著名領袖加里波狄將軍之後裔裘塞浦加里波狄、現請首相准其組織紅衫隊、服役阿比西尼亞、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>意相高據砲巓　激勵士氣雪奇恥</h3>
<p>意國歐度利　首相墨索里尼今日表示、對阿戰爭已為期不遠、墨氏身據一大砲之巓、向行將就道出發非洲之黑衫黨員一批演說、竭力鼓勵謂、意國軍隊向能戰勝黑種軍隊、惟有一八九六年之一次、意軍以四千之衆與阿軍十萬作戰、盡為殺戮云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>意報記者　欲與英少佐决鬥　英下院辯論引起反響</h3>
<p>（倫敦）法西斯派意報記者意人法萊列大尉今日宣布願與英下院工黨副領袖阿特里少佐决鬥、此為英下院近今辯論意阿爭案之反饗、法氏謂渠願在中立國用任何武器與阿氏一角雌雄、蓋以反對阿氏於辯論時所作某種保留故也、阿氏已予謝絕、謂决鬥乃解决爭議之野蠻的惡習、渠不屑出此、但法氏仍不滿意、决欲為之、阿氏接見路透訪員談及此事時、謂意國今日全無言論自由、致法氏不知英議院辯論時之所可許者云、按阿氏年五十二、曾參與歐戰、一九一九年以陸軍少佐職吿退、一九二四年曾任陸軍次官、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國審愼瞻顧　覓求與列强合作　英報評政府方策　謂一誤不可再誤</h3>
<p>（巴黎）小巴黎人報評論美國照復阿比西尼亞之文云、「英國對於阿比西尼亞問題、現仍覓求法國與各强之合作、此在法國則與意大利相友善、自以審愼為得計、卽在美國亦復如是、蓋恐國際間討論此一問題、則意阿衝突、匪特未能局部化、而且有擴大之虞、美國政府此種心理、實屬顯而易見』云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）觀察報評論意阿問題云、「不管部大臣艾登對於法意兩國所用之外交方策、各方評隲、已多表示不滿、自未可一誤再誤、至以國聯會現狀而論、其孱弱無能、無可諱言、吾人欲使之動員而對意施行制裁、又安可能、吾人若果倡導斯舉、旣足以摧毁國聯會而又自陷於孤立、若以法國而論、則其不願見阿比西尼亞事件之橫生枝節、自與吾人從同、但必須顧及對意之友誼耳、今吾人不出而干涉則已、苟欲出而干涉則非出於一戰不可、如出於一戰、則非與意大利聯盟、卽當援助阿比西尼亞、特在現狀之下、不便有所干涉、允宜審愼將事靜待時機、庶免妨害吾國對意關係耳、星期泰唔土報所持論調不異乎是、其言曰、「時局如此嚴重、內閣現正竭其全力以覔求解决方案、凡吾國民允宜不分黨派、同為政府後盾、前者艾登訪問羅馬、其所建議雖告失敗、但政府對於意阿爭案初未有恝置不理、而聽其一，仍現狀、絕無改善之意也」云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國造艦程序　將通知華府約簽字國　與英德恊定所載無關</h3>
<p>（柏林）據消息靈通方面探悉、德國將以目前在建造中及本年內開始建造各軍艦之隻數及噸數、通知華盛頓海軍條約各簽字國、此項通知與倫敦海軍恊定締結後之德國海軍造艦程序無關、倫敦海軍協定許德國建造軍艦佔英國百分之三十五、此項比率於數年後始可完成、且規定分年建造比例、其詳細造艦程序則猶在英德兩國談判中也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>波外長柏林之行　結果無大成就　波蘭西境現行疆界　未能使德明白承認</h3>
<p>（巴黎）時報評論柏林談話、謂德波兩國締結十年互不侵犯條約之後、波蘭外長柏克柏林之行、幷無何項成就、幷謂「華沙有力方面、原望柏克此行、能使德國明白承認波蘭西境現行疆界、至少德國元首希特勒對於去年一月二十六日所簽訂之互不侵犯條約、能發表宣言、願無限期延長之、孰意柏克所獲結果、僅一維持善鄰關係之聲明、此在現行局勢之下、似不足以　波蘭人之望也」云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　半官式波蘭郵報評論外長柏克柏林之行云、「波德兩國維持和平之志願、係以對於東歐之具體行動表示之、而不崇尙空談、此次外長柏林之行、別無其他目標、」又云、「雙方關係當在長時期之內、實行穩定其志願、業已充分表現、以與外交文件具有時期上之限制者相比較、誠有上下床之別、外長此次游德除禮儀上所受待遇而外、且在良好空氣中進行談話、則以友好空氣之重要性、實與談話目標相等故也」云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>小恊商反對　奧國復辟企圖　一切行動唯法馬首是瞻</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據辯論報消息最近小協約政治會議議决、凡奧國一有復辟企圖、卽須為危險之警號、各國卽須起而互助、同時小協約已將此項决議通知法國當局云、該報繼謂法國政治家對於小協約此種明顯之態度、必須予以注意、最要者卽不可忘却法國為小協約之聯盟者、此後一切行動、慎母使舊友變成新仇始為善策、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）奧國政府近將哈布斯堡皇室法律地位加以變更、此間淸議報發表評論、謂小協商各國業已為之不安、其言曰、「奧國必須生存、自歐洲視之實有必要、但復辟之舉、必在多瑙河流域引起極大之紛擾、反足威脅奧國之生存、一般人以為復辟之舉可以阻止德奧合併、實則非是、面在歐洲現行局勢之下、凡是以引起極端危險之變化者、務當有以避免之」云云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希副揆訪羅馬　此行與復辟事有關　公民投票展至十一月舉行</h3>
<p>雅典　國務副總理兼陸軍部長貢第利斯將軍、業於午後前往羅馬、將在該處勾留三日、並於啟程之前向報界發表談話稱、此行係應意國參戰軍人之請、並無正式性質云、一般人相信此行當與復辟問題有關、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>雅典　國務總理查爾達理斯、頃向報界發表談話云、個人關於國體問題之意見、擬俟適當時機發表之、公民投票原定於九月十五日舉行、政府因欲與反對黨商定投票手續、乃决定展期至十一月十五日、並謂「反對黨若願與政府誠實合作、俾國體問題得　確定解决、余敢斷言、國事必能遵循常軌　　演進、國體問題當以人民意志為依歸、非任何黨派所得而私、此則一般人所當知之者也云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>雅典　國民大會本日討論公民投票法案時農業部長戴阿多克斯發表演說、主張復辟、各議員均熱烈鼓堂贊成、大會旋卽閉會、定於星期　日續開、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>希臘廢王與后離異　經羅國上訴院判准</h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　上訴法院今日判决、准許希臘廢王與其王后離離婚、判决之前曾秘密審訊、控詞未經發表、最高法院大槪能於二星期內核准此項判决、按希臘人民方將投票决定政體問題、故此次離婚事件、殊有重大意義、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>外蒙當局宣布　滿洲里會議經過　偽恃日軍為背景提非分要求　越境事件層出不窮顯存侵略</h3>
<p>滿洲里　滿蒙第十二次會議、六日午後舉行、討論劃定國境問題、外蒙方面依其本國製及蘇聯製之地圖、始終主張哈爾哈廟附近屬於外蒙領域、不肯相讓、「滿洲國」方面加以痛烈之反駁、謂依此不完全之地圖、劃定重大之國境、殊欠妥當、論爭約二時間之久、於午後四時散會、下次定九月舉行、（七日電通電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）外蒙政府代理主席卓波爾桑、對庫倫報界發表談話如下、</p>
<p>追叙事由　本年一月、吾方報紙已載日「滿」軍隊侵吾領土、佔奪吾哈爾興廟一帶之領土、並向吾邊防駐軍開槍、死吾軍將領及士兵各一、吾邊防軍事當局為避免流血計、未採取軍事行動、而與滿方着手談判、以謀此項衝奪之和平解决、</p>
<p>談判開始　六月三日滿蒙代表團在滿洲里站開始談判、在會議開始數日內、吾方卽已懷疑傀儡政府是否有和平解决此項事件之誠意、吾方代表團由桑布主席、彼等百般設法謀得協定、以求及早解决、滿方代表團則反是、彼等不能以實是求是之精神、調查事件發生之背境、</p>
<p>偽無誠意　會議開始三週、彼等不願考慮此項問題、一味顧而之他、提出其他問題、孰知此等問題、吾代表團實無權討論同時當召集此項會議之際、雙方政府絕未提及此等問題、事實已甚明顯、滿洲代表企圖延緩交涉、且在過去數日、若干事實可以證明滿洲方面常受日本駐滿軍隊之支持、不願以和平手段解决哈爾興廟之衝突、反作進一步之侵佔吾國土地、以使國交更為緊張、</p>
<p>再度越境　六月二十三日哈爾興河上蒙古列巴漁塲東南七十公里地方松布爾派出所之所長、與二兵士騎馬巡行邊境、被二騎兵槍擊、後者被派出之巡邏隊所捕獲、查出其一係日本軍事地形考察者、另一為俄人、均在日本軍隊中服務、因常欲與我各鄰邦保持友誼關係、並根據各種瑣細邊境誤會應用和平態度解决、勿使牽涉巨大政治糾紛之觀點、故日本軍隊之二軍官雖已顯然非法越境、而我邊境當局在加以檢查之後、卽將被捕二人釋放、交回滿洲邊境駐軍、</p>
<p>唯最可怪者、當六月二十六日吾方將被捕人員二人交回滿方時、滿方邊防駐軍並不接受、六月二十八日經吾方竭力主張、吾方駐軍遂將此二人及其所有物件一併送交滿方駐卒、該被捕人員嗣用書面聲明、彼等確在蒙境被捕、且對侵渥待遇、表示謝意、</p>
<p>和平為懷　吾人僅向對方抗議侵入疆界、六月二十六日吾駐布倫底西區邊卒復兩次經滿方射擊、惟吾方仍令駐卒母為挑釁所誘、故吾方駐卒並未回擊、夫日軍軍官二人確於蒙境被捕、吾方竟將人物一併交回傀儡政府、此種事實已能表示吾方對於一切邊境糾紛、誠心願有和平之解决、同時此項問題似已儘够解决、因吾方有權向偽國要求、表示應對破壞鄰誼及吾邊界之人員予以嚴懲矣、</p>
<p>反提抗議　「滿方顯然不欲維持友善鄰誼、此點得由若干事實證之、六月二十六日蒙滿方拒絕收回吾方交予之二被捕軍官、六月二十七日偽外交部政治司司長于基（譯音）卽抵滿洲里站、訪晤吾主席代表桑布、要求將被捕人員立卽交回、並向偽國政府道歉、同時越境人員須予檢舉、七月四日康氏復訪桑布、且提出公函一件、托彼轉交、內有對於逮捕上述人員一舉之抗議、並提要求如下、</p>
<p>第一、此次事件外蒙須負全責、第二、外蒙須對越境人員嚴加追詢、傀儡政府要求有派遣代表長駐蒙境之權、同時此等代表得與偽國政府經常聯絡、且在蒙境有行動自由之權、此等要求蒙方如不接受、則偽國將要求湯木蘇克廟以東蒙軍、全部向湯地撤退、</p>
<p>無理要求　同日駐滿洲里之日本軍事代表團團長訪問桑布、代表關東軍司令部證實並擴大此同樣要求、特別着重於要求使關東軍有權遣派代表入蒙、在蒙古境內建立電報綫以典之聯絡絡交通、</p>
<p>此項聲明特別令人難解、因旣非出自日本政府、又非出自傀儡政府、而係出自駐於南滿之關東軍隊、且其交涉對象為外蒙、彼等過去現在、均無任何關係、服務於日本軍軍官二人之在我國境內被捕、外蒙對於該問題之解决、固已表示特殊之和平態度、然此事竟被滿洲當局轉化而為無理要求之一藉口、以為阻碍外蒙與傀儡政府之相互關係、外蒙對於日滿當局非法及難解之行動異常驚愕、因其踐踏正理之最基本之法則、及各民族之和平共存」、（七日塔斯電）</p>

<p>統制貿易、能否在我國施行、學者意見、頗不一致、我國經濟組織不健全交地位困難、實施統制、比較不易、但國民經濟衰落至此、不應畏避難難、祇須出以整個計劃與堅強決心、則困難自可克服、其步驟可分爲三步、（一）修改關稅稅則、分別提高進口稅、外交方面、雖有阻力、但我根據法律事實相折衛、當不難解除、（二）輸出統制與健全工商業之組織、由國家根據市塲供需情形、管理貸品產製之數量、價格品質、求適合於國外市塲之條件、同業間爲謀共同合作、金融互助、及免去無謂競爭、更應有健全之組織、補救營業上之弱點、出口貿易、應漸求不必假手於外商、（三）輸入限額制、施行困難有三點、第一、各國方以我爲貸物銷塲、協議限額、無異與虎謀皮、第二、進口商多爲洋行、恐不肯就範、第三、施行後、國內商人營業數額縮小、勢必反對、以第一項爲最困難、如第一項解決、其餘亦迎刃而解、以我國目前處境、當爲各國所共見、一國銷納外貨、有最大限度、如貧窮至最高程度時、因購買力減退、輸入貸品、勢必銳減、我國已有此現狀、長此友往、進口貿易、縱不加限制、亦必逐漸減少、設不幸而中國經濟呈最後之總崩潰、則各國對華商業、亦必同歸於盡、輸入限制如果實行、使我國經濟得以恢復、則各國在華商務、得益孔多、各國企業家銀行家、大約亦明瞭此意、故協議限制、並非絕不可能、</p>
<p>提介國貸</p>
<p>提倡國貨、此口號已有多年、但未能發生多大效力、其重要原因、爲（一）受苛捐雜稅及國內變亂之影響、（二）國民缺乏愛國心、今後應求、（甲）苛雜之切實廢除、以解除生產事業之束縛、各地方政府、雖因財政困難、不能澈底裁廢苛雜、但如民間生產事業不能發達、則工商業與財政同陷末路、應監督地方官吏、專門敷衍功令、將名義上已廢捐稅、另以其他方法取索商民、（乙）國民愛國心之激發、取法俄意、堅强擁護國家計劃之精神、犧牲個人之舒適、購用國貨、以促國貨之發達、以國貨如與外國貨同樣價廉物美、則早無庸提倡矣、</p>
<p>節約運動</p>
<p>國家如家庭然、當貧窮之時、祗有减少消費、我國工商業尙未發達、而國民生活程度、與日俱增、依經濟理論言、生活費用增高、或消費擴張、足以鼓勵生產、繁榮工商業、但連洋貨充斥之我國、則消費擴張之結果、爲多數金錢流出國外、吸收洋貨、壓倒國貨、故國民節約運動、减少外貨入超、亦爲挽救國民經濟頹勢之一法云云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （菱湖昭）</p>
<p>無綫電發明家馬可尼氏說：「中國科學不發達的原因，就是缺少眞正的科學方法。」的確，講到科學方法，我們向來沒有認眞注意過。</p>
<p>我們無須追溯幾千年前，就是最近一二百年來，不論任何學術大半還是拘守古人的陳言；說得顯明些，無疑中了「好讀書，不求甚解」的毒呵！</p>
<p>至於孔子敎學的「唯一」的方法，也不過主張「致知」在「格物」。可是對於「格物」的方法，却始終不曾具體的解釋出來。</p>
<p>培根吿訴我們，眞正的科學方法是從（一）觀察，（二）實騐，（三）分類，（四）分析，（五）假設，（六）歸納，（七）綜合，（八）定律和學說等組合而定成的。</p>
<p>最後我得說一句若以「好讀書，不求甚解」的態度，來研究科學，是亡國有餘的。</p>
<h3>農村返照</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>住慣了都市，便怕走向農村。及至回到了農村，却又戚到一種恬靜舒適的意趣。看看綠野，聽聽蟬聲，嘗嘗瓜果，赤足裸腿，了無拘束。鷄鳴犬吠，鳥語蛙歌，代替了都市中間一片嘈雜煩噪的聲音。</p>
<p>幾天梅雨，蘇醒了萎黃的穀苗，顯現著滿野新嫩的生意。棉秧起初乾得透不出芽，雨後天氣轉凉，苗是茁長了，但瑟縮着尙未發育。農村裏的工作，並不緊張。許多老幼男婦欲出賣勞力而不得。散工每日的工資，還不够換取一日的油米。</p>
<p>因爲黃梅雨遲到的緣故，有許多栽種豆棉的田，臨時改種了山薯，山薯藤求過於供，每斤賣到一百四十文，在往年過賸的時候，原來是半文不値的。</p>
<p>十年以前，吾們的村裏，不管日裏夜裏，長年可以聽到一片機織的聲音。生產着大量銷售到關東去的大布。在初夏的季節，大家小戶，還忙着摘桑育蠶。近年絲業沒落繭價還抵不够桑葉的成本。紗布又完全斷絕了去路。於是這兩種主要的農村副業都宣吿了日暮途窮。農民的膏血，只有被吮而沒有注入，婚喪喜慶等最小限度的酬應，又不能絕對的還淳返樸，歸到老死不相往來的境界。典當衣庫，變了積穀的倉房。小康化爲破落，破落變爲赤貪。精壯的男人奔向都市去拉包車，當苦力；健碩的婦女擠到都市去當傭婦、做乳母。安分忠厚些的老百姓們，照常死守着已破的農村壁壘，靜侯着轉綠迴黃的天命。</p>
<p>農村破產，奔向都市；都市崩潰，回到農村；來去都是碰壁，出路究在那裏？</p>
<h3>駱駝</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>大街上，小巷裏，常有走江湖的，牽着一頭又髒又瘦的駱駝走着。有時喊着駱駝算命，有時又嚷着駱駝醫病。背後總是跟着一大羣孩子嚷着瞧着。有的站得遠遠地，對着駱駝投着一塊二塊小石子。胆壯的，走近駱駝去，對着它的肚子上拍一下。這些，駱駝似乎都不管，只是跟着它的主人，毫無目的地，拖着沉重的脚步，搬動着龐大的身子，向前一步一步地邁進。有時，會因它的主人在給人算命，或替人醫病，而把腿屈着，暫時地休息一下。</p>
<p>駱駝，是那麼的一個龐大的動物，它雖然沒有馬那麽聰慧，它雖然沒有騾那麽狡猾，但是有任重致遠的天才，却是任誰都够不上它。它能負起了重大的負担，踱着紳士模樣的步子，跋涉過廣大得辨不明方向的沙漠地。它能够利用着天賦予的特殊的生理機構，自己帶着豐富的食糧和飲料，雖然人的目光中，這是運貨的工具。但是，在某一個時代裏，或是，在某一個地域裏，我覺得駱駝還負着溝通文化的責任。偉大哉駱駝。</p>
<p>但是，在都市裏，更其是在我們這個東方的大都市裏，駱駝，是沒落了。它所給與我們的印象，是極度的醜惡，——它是成了江湖流浪者騙錢的幌子了。</p>
<h3>天下無如吃飯難</h3>
<p>— （紀一介）</p>
<p>吳稚暉先生，昔在無錫敎育學院講演，演詞中有「中國人個個要學會一種吃飯的本領，個個都能做飯桶，不但學會自己有吃飯的本領，更要學會給人吃飯的本領，一個人有了這樣本領，發一二百萬大財，是不成問題的，要是沒有這種本領，非但不能發財，恐怕還要凍死餓死」等語，稚老這一席話，現身說法，妙趣橫生，可謂極其幽默的能事，比較當年黎菩薩「有飯大家吃」的現成話，尤爲雋永。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十五回　苦口波心不平空拍案錢聲燈彩可憐正賣人</p>
<p>志前將屋裏的燈擰得火燄小小的，也就走出院子來。這空地裏正有一堆蓋房子的靑磚，就向磚堆裏一閃。看時，一團手電筒閃的白光，在空塲裏射着。接着茶房引了幾個人走過去。正是楊浣花胡嫂子陪了朱月英來了。胡嫂子道：月英你爲什麽都要聽賈老爺的話，你不是個娃，你不要鬧啥脾氣。我們不是窮麽，有飯吃，那會要你這樣定了終身大事？志前等他們過去，立刻在後面悄悄跟着。楊浣花道：這就狠好了。賈老爺多有錢，將來你吃不盡，穿不盡。那朱月英由他們去說，却只是低了頭走。到了前面第二重院子，是賈多才屋外邊了。月英才站住了。那院子裏還有一盞汽油燈沒有熄，志前在牆角邊站住，遙遠看到那姑娘的臉色，有點蒼白。他回轉頭對胡嫂子道：你不必送我進去了。你回去勸我娘和我奶奶不要哭。我自己的事，我自己知道，我們不是窮麽？我的命該如此，我……楊浣花立刻向前握了他的手，又將手絹在他臉上按了幾下。於是他牽着這可憐的姑娘進了那房門。不多久，楊浣花出來了，帶上了房門，隨着那窗戶上的布簾子也遮住了燈光。志前在墦角落裏，只看到那引路的茶房，向這兩個婦人，作了一個鬼臉。好像是戲台上的扮戲人，在閉慕的時候，作個表情一樣。（二五九）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>我當然祇有依着辦，便像一位上司似的押着那四個御醫，走到了另外一所偏殿中法。這裏已和太后的寢宮相隔着兩個宮庭了。殿字雖然也是狠高大，狠潔凈，可是因爲平常難得有人走來的緣故，氣象狠是慘淡，還帶些霉氣。它的四面的壁上，滿釘着一行行的木架子，而在每一行木架子上，便排列着無數的白色的和　色的磁罎。每個罎都有蓋子蓋着，罎的外面，又用一小方的紅紙標明着罎內所藏的藥品的名字，以便檢取；有些體積不大的藥物，往往每兩種或三種合裝一罎。所以這一間大殿上所藏的藥品，眞不下五六百種，大槪是齊全了，祗有幾種非用新鮮不可的才讓外面的藥舖子供給　如今且說那四位御醫老爺接了這一張第五張的藥方之後，他們自己所開的四張是早巳給李蓮英撕掉了——雖然心上都未必贊同，但他們怎敢和太后拗執呢？少不得依着她，一伴一伴的配將起來。雖然依我猜想，他們四位旣然都是年事雖狠高的老醫生，諒來總和這些藥罎相處得極久而極熟了，可是他們在配藥的時候，還是像生手一般的遲慢，必須再三的端詳了才敢把藥取出來。據說這也是他們謹愼將事，不肯苟且的緣故。每一樣藥物取出來之後，還得用一枝小天平秤仔細細地秤出相當的分量來，然後再用紅紙包成一個個的小包，給一個小太監捧着。（三五九）</p>
<h3>剿蝗</h3>
<p>— 沈瘦若</p>
<p>海蕩發現蝗蝻了！一般農民好像不曾知覺，並不立時設法撲滅。那曉得它們的貽害地方，甚於盜賊的劫掠呢！</p>
<p>還是官廳方面具有先知先覺的意識，一得了發現蝗蝻的消息，急如星火，馬上派員下鄉召集了許多民衆，運用保甲的活力，組織滅蝗隊。指揮他們在各個蝶蝻窠的四週，先掘了一條小壕溝，以爲小包圍的陣綫；同時在蝗蝻窠集中地以外，距離稍遠的四週地帶掘了一條長長的大壕溝，大約二三尺闊，三四尺深，溝中每距四五尺掘一深潭，以爲大包圍陣綫的設備。</p>
<p>兩條剿蝗的陣綫，旣經設備好，於是開始總動員了。在總指揮發施號令之下，有的手持麥鞭，來向蘆柴中驅趕；有的傾倒媒油，縱火焚燒。蝗蝻驟遭兩重猛攻，不得不被迫跳逃。說也奇怪，它們的跳逃，是隨着風勢的，比如南風，它們一齊向北跳逃；據說跳逃之聲，有如千軍萬馬，煞是嘈雜哩。</p>
<p>它們在急遽中遭難，　除當塲擊斃或燒殺者外，大多數總是紛紛跳逃，有的跌在小壕溝中，奄奄待斃；就是幸能逃出，依然向前跳去，但是到臨大壕溝邊，前仆後繼的作了陷阱裏的俘虜，無一倖免。不過它們在壕　尙能跳躍，只是跳入壕裏的深潭，性命從此完結了！是役計坑降卒數千萬，勝利的凱歌聲，至今在鄉村裏還有餘音啊。</p>

<h3>雨後登靈巖</h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>正是黃梅天十八變，早上乘車的時候天氣還是那麽淸朗的，然而當車頭駛進蘇州站月臺的時候，天空中却浙淅瀝瀝的洒起雨來，而且是那麼緊密的。我們下了車，看看雨越下越大，一些沒有停止的樣子；於是便走進了車站的酒排間里去，各人喝了一杯牛奶咖啡，準備等待雨小些冉呌車子。可是坐了足足有兩個鐘頭，雨不但沒有小，並且更傾盆如注的下得爽快了。然而我們今天還得搭輪船當日趕到木凟的；所以三個人就僱了一輛馬車在雷雨下向胥門進行。</p>
<p>下了輪船，雨雖然已比剛小了，可還在斷斷續續地下着，那隻笨大的輪船也就在這細雨霏霏中航行。我們已照例一夥兒擠在一起談天，磕瓜子，嚼泡泡糖，和看窗外的景色。</p>
<p>船抵木凟的時候，已是雨過天靑，不過街道中却還泥濘；好在輪船埠頭離開我們的目的地不十分遠，所以十二枚銅元一輛黃包車就可以拉到門口了。</p>
<p>媚，英，和我三個人僱了三輛車子，沒有五分鐘便到了貞的家里，貞見了我們歡喜得什麽似的。</p>
<p>街上慢慢地乾燥了起來，後門口河里的船隻也擠不開的喝么着，我跑到對門弄底去望望，覺得一座山，一爿田，一溜河，全是怪可愛的；前面靈巖山巓上的那支塔尖，傲然地像要戳破那碧澄的天幕，幾縷乳白色的游絲却在繞着山峯飛行。「雨過山峯綠，日出波光紅」，禁不住我這顆頑皮的童心也給這幽美的環境逼得活躍了起來。</p>
<p>「媚，我們去玩靈巖山吧；雨後的風景是很可愛的，我們別要錯過了這好機會」！我回來興奮地對媚等說；貞却提出了反對的意見：</p>
<p>「好吧，淘氣的孩子，歇息歇息明天再去玩吧；况且雨後的山道是多麽地濘滑……」</p>
<p>經過了許久的爭論，勝利最後終於屬於了我，貞，英，媚，都陪着我踏着微潮的草徑，從田疇中穿過去，山坡下有一座「再來人墓」，那里除了有一片綠蔭蔽空的梅林外，却沒有什麽特別風景可尋。</p>
<p>四個人循着磚砌的山路往上爬，爬到了半山，已是氣喘吁吁力不能支了，媚，貞，英，却給我丟在遙遠的背後。坐在「迎笑亭」里等了一回，伊們才趕到，然而幾件薄綢和輕紗的旗衫，也全給汗水滲透了。</p>
<p>「好熱的天氣，跟他來討苦吃」！貞恨恨地看着我說。</p>
<p>到了山嶺上，靈巖寺的大殿正纔建築完工；「吳五臺」，「西施梳妝臺」，「仙人洞」，「痴漢等老婆」等許多有歷史古蹟的地方，我們都去流連了一回。</p>
<p>站在石巖上，縱目四眺，所有湖光山色，風景田舍，靡不盡收眼底，淸風拂袂，這時我們覺得有飄飄欲仙之慨了！</p>
<p>「多麽孩子氣呵，可是我們這些過意做作出來的行爲反而顯得很可憐了」！在慕色蒼茫的歸途中，我們坐了山轎回來，可是我的心底傑處却有一秤茫然的感覺溢了出來……</p>
<h3>良醫靈藥記</h3>

<p>青年藝術家汪滌塵。早歳遊歐。遍歷法意德諸國。故造詣極深。歸國後。即任東北某大學藝術教授。極為全校所推重。但汪君雖年近而立。以半生瘁于藝術。家室之願。固猶未遂也。校中有女生方蕊芝者。綺年玉貌。品學兼優。而又酷嗜藝術。故于汪教授。心詣實深。平時師生于討論學術之餘。雙方不能無動于中。一學期後。竟由師生戀愛。而結為正式夫婦矣。由藝術而締造之愛。美滿為何如乎。亡何。九一八國難起。三省淪亡。某大學亦因以瓦解。汪君遂携眷倉卒走平。痛山河之破碎。感家室之流離。因刺㦸深重。乃亦效醇酒婦人之舉。寄情花月。恣意狎邪。以青年有用之身。投無情之慾壡。良足痛惜。方女士固不料乃夫到平後之行動。不于衣食生計着想。而乃為此頽䘮志氣之舉也。何如風月塲中。盡是蛇蝎。汪君三月連留。千金易耗。最可痛心而愧對室人者。則竟染毒而淋矣。初時尚力自隱忍。不期若干日後。復傳深及于妻子。方女士始知乃夫于此國難家禍之際。尚復微逐風月。致連累而同染亞疾。恨怒之餘。遂嚴詰之。汪君始吐實相告。且深自懺悔。極端安慰之。得不致掀起風波。此後居平三年。夫婦鬻畫自給。感情雖佳。而惡疾綿。百藥罔效。且方女士又不願就醫。汪君雖醫而時愈時發。以致藝術結晶。三四年來尚一無所育也。去年應海上某大公司等之聘。任藝術設計。夫婦遂又相偕南來。比時因舟車勞頓。疾復發。每于辦事時深感痛苦。適同事中有作狎邪遊而患淋疾者。方經法租界寧波路六十四號。孫緯才父子醫院治愈。深慶惡疾得除。常形諸言談間。汪君聞之。叩其情形屬實。遂决意前往根本治療。經該院用最新式短波透熱電療。兼注射内服並進。旬日後。盡然全愈。但方女士以始終不願就醫。帶下無寧日。以致體日以虚。亦經用該院發售之内服白帶丸。及外用白帶藥治愈。而所費每種每盒祗二元。夫婦欣喜。自不待言。此後汪君與方女士於藝術上之努力。固無身體精神上之妨碍。而今夏方女士且誕一麟兒。以紀念藝術之結晶矣。寧非良醫良藥之功歟。記者與汪君為同事。故知其事特詳。</p>

<p>（港訊）滬中華足球隊承吧城體育會之邀請、點將南征爪哇、一切川資費用、俱由羣力負擔、中華隊以全運會期已近、正好乘此機會使球員藉資練習、故全國體育會當局接羣力請柬後、即選將點兵、組織勁旅、惜名將如馮運秋、萬象華、賈幼良、因事不能離滬、只得健兒十二人、浩浩蕩蕩、於去月二十九日由滬趁法郵船亞拉美號出發、於本月二日晨六時抵港、船泊碼頭時、中西報記者、及球玉李惠堂、曹桂成、麥蘇、黎國釗、何家强等均到輪、</p>
<p>小試腳頭</p>
<p>該隊由余衡之率領、抵港後、往加路連山小試脚頭、細察前鋒脚頭踢來頗頸、姜路鐵，腿初試、未見精彩、中後衛踢法平平、甚爲遜色、全隊弱點、在於是間、徐亨自與余女士訂婚後、春風滿面、高球之拿接、依然穩固如昔、低球之來、亨哥倒仍是望球興嘆、中華隊除滬隊爲基本隊外、招港星健將數名參加、茲將該隊陣勢錄下、</p>
<p>徐亨</p>
<p>李寗　江善敬　關洵安</p>
<p>許竟成　陳鎭祥　梁樹棠</p>
<p>姜璐　孫錦順　李義臣　陳家球　鄭季良　鍾勇森　曹桂成</p>
<p>實力略評</p>
<p>全隊實力、表面上頗見强勁、前鋒以星港滬三埠戰將組成、於聯絡上恐未必如意，況李孫二主將、身體肥胖、全綫之推進、必爲之阻遲、姜璐、曹桂成久疏於練習、偶遇强盜、恐未易收水到渠通之功、中後衛力異常薄弱、不足以禦强隊前鋒之襲擊、門將徐亨、祇能接高球、若遇低球、彼祇能鞠躬請球入門、况南島足球隊之前鋒、皆以善射底球著名者、亨哥守門、當陣陣堪虞也、</p>
<p>曹何漏船</p>
<p>曹桂成與何家强、本定二日同船隨軍出發、惟法輪於二日午十二時離港、何家強因誤會該船於下午四時離港、曹桂成因亦誤會故、亦未克趕及、飛將軍不無有翼難飛之歎、法郵於是日午離港赴西貢、至何曹兩將須於五日改乘荷輪赴星洲歸隊、麥紹漢因空軍當局因要事電召返省、亦未克成行、</p>
<p>陳徐兩將</p>
<p>麥黎旣不能爲中華隊效力、故余君抵港後、曾與李惠堂磋商、邀陳鎭和與徐亞輝參加、惟陳徐二人、肄業於省校、該校於本月十五日始開始放假、由本港往返爪哇海程、需時一月有奇、時間短怱、現未能依期趨及上課、苟陳徐兩君若能提前向校請假、則可與曹何二將同輪出發也、</p>
<p>借將困難</p>
<p>滬中華隊此次南征、戰將僅得十二人、苟球員於陳中受傷、誠恐替補無人、故余衡之本擬在港借將四名、嗣因麥黎兩將之不能同行、余君最後之希望、仍冀在星洲方面邀請鄭季良或一二名健將參加、以增厚實力、惟以記者所知、星洲足球季尙未結束、且星方足球總會限制足球員之規例甚嚴、舉凡星洲足球員在足球季內、欲隨別隊遠征者、須先徵得總會同意而後可、比例於前數年、因鄭季良陳玉書隨南華隊征爪哇時、曾執行一次、結果鄭陳二人被停止比賽資格一年、滬中華隊、此次過星偕將、未知鄭季良能否於足球季內、得獲足球總會之准許隨隊出發否、</p>
<p>比賽程度</p>
<p>該隊由吧城羣力會代爲挑定、中華隊南征之第一戰、在西東舉行、過星洲時、不作比賽、大抵在爪哇比賽十五塲、計吧城四塲、泗水三塲、萬隆兩塲、梭羅一塲、日惹一塲、三寳壟兩塲、瑪奎一塲、回旌時始在星洲比賽、</p>
<p>孫錦順談</p>
<p>足球　將孫鐵腿、送妻南下、孫仍隨隊出發、記者事前、曾聞孫氏將於下屆留港爲中華隊效力、乃向孫君詢問此事足否屬實、據孫氏謂、彼來港與否、尚難決定、此次南征返滬後、如仍留滬、或將爲東華隊效力、亦未可定云、又查孫氏此次兩遊、其眷屬亦隨去、有小鐵腿四條、長名福康、年六歲、幼者則尙在懷抱中也、福康活潑可愛、確信乎虎將無犬子也、</p>

<h3>工業統制與限制生產</h3>
<p>— 潘明珊</p>
<p>自一九二八年世界經濟恐慌發生，至一九三四年形勢愈形險惡，工商業及金融界均在極嚴重之情況下掙扎，經濟思潮亦因是改變，在昔崇尚自由放任主義，隨天演之改進，以為市面極度繁榮以後，應有收縮之現象，然後再循環恢復經濟之平衡，殊不知此種循環時期之短長，與夫經濟平衡如何達到，均屬假想的理論根據，因此，在事實上之需要，一般經濟學者，均主張經濟統制，在市面不安狀態下，斷不能再依附假想的理論上着想，應厲行一種極有效之統制辦法為之補救，否則整個社會經濟的組織，將陷於崩潰，蘇俄之五年計劃與美之工業復興法皆其實例。</p>
<p>一般趨時者流，人云亦云，以為挽救中國工商業之衰頹，可因襲歐美統制之成法，殊不知各國有各國之歷史變遷，有各國環境之不同，是如何實行統制，斷非因襲成法足以奏效。美之工業復興法，着重限制生產以消除不公平之競爭，因為工業經濟已極度發過，生產過剩，在商品市場未能適應以前，形成生產過剩之狀態，妨碍工業之發展，乃實施工業統制，以限制生產，避免過剩，使商品市場與生產行程相適應，則存貨不致堆積；銷路不致呆滯，其最顯著之特徵，當在限制生產。蘇俄之人民，十分之七八，尚屬農民，在革命前，工業尚未臻充分發達，革命後，則方在萌芽之工業，又經一度之波折，如施行限制生產辦法，則不啻獎勵外貨之推銷，故對於工業，不採用限制生產辦法，是各個有各個之環境，斷不能一概而論也。</p>
<p>我國工業之衰頽，經濟恐慌日趨尖銳化，實施工業統制以打開此僵局，自經各界倡導後，逐漸進於具體化，惟如何統制，頗有討論之必要。蓋中國自甲午戰後，簽訂馬關條約，在條約中規定日人得在我國通商口岸設廠製造。各國以最惠國待遇之優越權利，均得援用在我國口岸設廠，我國原料豐富，人工低廉，外人乃投資我國，在通商口岸設廠製造貨物，利用我低廉之人工，豐富之原料，用精確之管理，熟諳之技術，其出品優良，成本低，價格小，自在意中，與我幼稚之工業品在市場競爭，優勝劣敗，不待龜卜。況我人在我國設立之工廠，不受我主管官廳之監督，利用條約及租界為護符，暢所欲為。至限制某種工業品之生產，須先調查其全國銷費量及生產量，然後得知供求是否平衡，有無生產過剩情形，國人設立之工廠姑不具論，外人設立之工廠，根本不受約束，其生產量無從調查，是則全國生產量無從統計，換言之，某種工業品之全國產量是否超過銷費總額而有生產過剩現象，根本上不能詳悉，此其一。</p>
<p>工商業之日趨凋敝，一半由於外貨之傾銷，一半由於內地農村破產，購買力減低，致造成生產過剩之畸形狀態，此種生產過剩係變態的，實由於銷場之狹隘，而發生此種不自然之過剩，若誤認此種不自然之生產過剩，為我國某種工業過度之發展，乃採取限制生產辦法，以減少其生產量，調節供求之平衡，此種根據實屬錯誤，因為我國工業生產過剩，絕非由於工業過度之發展，乃生產之飽和，乃屬於工業之極度衰落，不能保障其地盤，任從外貨之傾銷，致銷場日隘，貨品無從脫售，形成一種不自然過剩之病態。如不力謀振作，自圖改良，以與外貨競爭，乃限制生產，不啻為外貨造成傾銷之機會，愈促我國工業之衰落，故限制生產，能否使工業復興，實屬疑問，此其二。</p>
<p>我國工業未發達，輕工業略具萌芽，重工業更無論矣。如認目前之生產，發生過剩，對於新設者加以限制，實屬因噎廢食。我國門戶洞開，關稅未能完全自主，對進口洋貨，既不能增加進口稅以為防止；又不能實行傾銷稅以阻其傾銷且以銀貴金賤，各國減低幣值，匯價低落，廉價推銷，我國如對新設工廠加以限制，則工廠少，產量減低，以自薄其競爭力量，間接即足以助長外貨之傾銷，此應考慮者三。</p>
<p>抵制外貨傾銷，須增厚其抵抗力量，工業統制，自屬對針良藥，但統制不能從限制工廠設立及限制生產着手。一方應積極增加生產，改良技術，管理周密，裝置完善，以求生產成本之減低，貨品之精良，冀能與外貨爭一日這短長；一方則當推廣銷路，使人民之贖買力提高，銷路廣，則生產自不為過剩，如是工業始高有蓬勃發展之望，工業統制之成效如著，如囿於維持現狀為已足則根本錯誤矣。</p>
<h3>統制工業之我見</h3>
<p>— 鄧伯熙</p>
<p>（一）施行工業統制之疑義</p>
<p>年來列邦為挽救其本國經濟恐慌起見，競以我國為其過剩生產品宣洩之尾閭。不特我新興民族工業受其致命打擊，即吾整個國民經濟亦將日即危殆。整肅我方陣容，從事抵抗傾銷，自屬無可非議。惟此乃「計劃經濟」之所有事，而非「統制經濟」之所能言。目統制工業，適足予外國工業品以傾銷之機會。此則吾人對於工業統制深致其疑惑者，一也。</p>
<p>夫自由競爭乃資本主義之骨幹。所謂「互相傾軋」者，乃自由競爭之表現，而為資本主義制度下必然之現象。兩世紀來！列邦工業，突飛猛進，探本追源，未始不由於此。吾國民族工業方始萌芽，正有賴於「互相傾軋」，以促其進展，安得施行統制，以塞其前途。此則吾人對於工業統制深致其疑惑者，二也。</p>
<p>且所謂生產過剩者，果係實在之現象乎？即曰實在，其原因又果在工業界同業間之「互相傾軋」以致生產過剩者，更屬觀察有誤之言。今乃欲憑此錯誤之觀察，療治不自然之現象。此則吾人對於工業統制深致其疑惑者，三也。</p>
<p>即退一步言，此觀察而不錯誤，此現象而果實在，然工業統制施行後，能否廣闢銷場，吸納此過剩之生產，亦成疑問。從事實上觀之，在目前不景氣之氛圈中，廣闢銷場，談何容易。欲求生產不過剩，恐仍不免出於限制生產之一途，前此，棉業生產統制委員會之統制計劃，即以限制生產為鴰的，可為明證。是則施行工業統制之結果，不特不能致「重危之工業」於繁榮，且將使「重危之工業」加速其死亡。即能倖免死亡，充其極，亦不過維持原有工業之現狀而已，易足以圖未來之進展。丁此經濟帝國主義者環攻之下，吾人已無能退回自給自足之農業時代（Agrarian　Age），勢必向「工業化」之途邁進，庶足抵抗外國工業品之侵略。安容各有徘徊瞻顧，自居劣敗？此則吾人對於工業統制深致其疑惑者，四也。</p>
<p>（二）工業衰落之真因</p>
<p>自十八世紀產業革命以來，列邦之工業，因機器之引用，與管理之合理化，出產大事增加；而勞工之失業者亦隨而愈眾，大家之贖買力因隨而愈薄。增加之生產，難覓得其購主。其初，幸有富庶之家，賴前世之積蓄，以吸納之，故工業仍能逐步進展。及此積蓄耗竭殆盡，銷納者「增加之生產」之責，遂移於購買力日弱之大眾。大家無能負此重任。增加之生產，銷路遂窄，隨而感覺生產過剩，工業衰落，而不景氣來矣。且也，工業愈衰落，勞工之失業者愈眾，大眾之購買力愈減；大眾購買國力愈減，工業品之銷路愈窄，工業愈衰落，又誘致大眾購買力之減弱。此中關係，如環無端，為禍無窮，莫能逢拔，而探本追源，則造始於大眾購買力之薄弱。由此可見大眾購買力之薄弱，實為工業不振之真因。我國工業，方始萌芽，產量尚少，若無其他原因，大眾之購買力尚堪担負銷納之責（？）。乃以年來，內則農村經濟破產，外則不景氣鼓盪，傾銷品侵襲。大眾購買力日弱。本國工業品之銷場日仄，方興之工業，遂因之而有「垂危」之感矣。是則造成大眾購買力薄弱而致工業衰落之結果則一。此即我國工業衰落之真因也。</p>
<p>（三）施行工業統制不如提高大眾之購買力</p>
<p>然則工業統制施行上，疑義之多既如彼，而大眾贖買力之薄弱為工業衰落之真因，又如此。居今而言「挽救垂危之工業」，與其施行工業統制，毋庸提高大眾購買力也，明矣。提高大眾購買力之道維何？曰，最主要者，厥炎勞工政策之實施。</p>
<p>（一）增加工資與減低物價　增加工資，則勞工之收入增加，購買力自因而增加，厥理甚顯。然貨幣不過價值之準繩，而非財財富之本體。若工資增加，物價隨而增加，則所得者，與前仍為五十步與百步之比耳，購買力易足以言增加。故增加工資，必隨以減低物價；（指勞工所生產之物價）或物價不動，維持工資之價值；或單獨減低物價，增加工資之價值。誠如是，工資之增加，可謂真工資（Real　Ｗages)之增加。購買力增加之效始顯。此則美國大眾生產者（Mass-productionist）所曾實行者也。</p>
<p>（二）縮短時間與利用技術失業（Technology-Unemploymnt）購買力已因真工資之增加而增加矣，然若勞工無餘暇以運用其購買力，則購買力增加之效及於工業者亦僅，故乃須供給勞工以運用購買力餘暇，即縮短工作時間是也。年來因工業技術進步，人工之需要減少，遂發生所謂技術失業。世人皆認為不利於勞工而無法解決。實則若能利用之以供給勞工以餘暇，俾得運用增加之購買力，則化不利為有利矣。例如將工作時間，由每日八小時，減至二小時，或每年工作三百日，每日工作八小時者，減為每年七十五日，每日工作八小時，餘日仍領全工。假定進步之技術，能於半天內完成前此一天之工作，則勞工亦得運用其增加四倍之購買力，以吸納此增加兩倍之生產矣。且縮短工作時間，非徒給勞工以運用購買力之餘暇已也，且能造成新職業。蓋勞工可利用其餘暇以遊歷，讀書，繪畫等，則凡旅館，汽車，汽船，書肆，顏料等職業，遂緣此而興矣。</p>
<p>（三）失業保險與職業保險　勞工之購買力已增加矣，且有餘暇以運用其增加之購買力矣，然若其職業悉無保障，則彼輩寗願以增加之購買力，儲作將來之衣食，而不願以之作消費矣。故在施行上述兩政策後，仍須舉辦失業保險（Insurance　for　Uenmployment），俾勞工預知無失業痛苦，而安心運用其購買力於消費之途。然此不過失業後補救耳，仍不能盡袪其疑慮。故在理論上，尚須舉辦職業保險（Ingnrance　for　employment），俾其職業得有保障。惟事實上，因施行上述諸政策之結果，大眾購買力增加，工業產品之銷場擴大，工業之繁榮回復，勞工之需要日切，勞工可無失業之患矣。</p>
<p>（四）工業統制及於大眾購買力損害</p>
<p>施行工業統制，不如提高大眾購買力之理由，已如上述。然而工業統制與提高大眾購買力政策可以並行不悖乎？此則尚有待於研究者也。從事實上觀之，工業統制，不特不能與提高大眾購買力政策同時並行，且與提高大眾購買力政策絕端相反，因其太有損於大眾購買力也。理由如左：</p>
<p>施行工業統制之害，其及於他方面者，無論已，其及於勞工方面者，必有二：（一）勞工之得業難；（二）勞工之失業易。前者影響及於未來之勞工，後者及於在職之勞工。蓋統制工業在目前之情勢下，必出於限制生產之一途，前已言之。生產既受限制，則勞工之需要自減少，勞工之勞力，將難覓得其銷售之所矣。且也，施行工業統制之結果，小工廠常立於劣敗之地位，必逐漸為大工廠所淘汰。小工廠地位不安定，勞工遂隨時有失業之可能矣。其影響無論由於前者，抑由於後者，俱足致勞工購買力之降低。其有損於勞工之購買力也，明甚。此則從勞工方面觀察者也，茲請再從農民方面觀察之。</p>
<p>自西方資本主義侵入我國後，農村經濟發生急遽之變化。機製品打倒手藝品之結果，使農民盡拋其自給自足之計劃，而依賴與工業家「交換」以為主，馴至淪為工業家之奴隸，聽工業家之驅策。工業家需要原料，農民作物之種類遂不得不趨於單純，化作原料之供給之。（可以年來各烟廠紗廠在陝西，河南，山東等省獎勵棉花，烟草種植證之。）工業家需要大量供給，農民乃不得不引用機器或改良技術，以事大量生產而供給之。（可以年來農事機器進口之激增，及集體農場之試行證之。）山前一事實發生之結果，農民遂成工業勞工之一部份，托其性命於工廠。若施行工業統制之結果，必為大工廠淘汰小工廠，則平日托命於小工廠之農民，必道受犧牲而失業，購買力將因之而喪失，由後一事實所生之結果，農村發生勞工之過剩。此批過剩之勞工乃流入城市而加大勞工之集團。若施行工業統制之結果，必為勞工需要之減少，則此農村過剩之勞工，將無從覓得噉飯地，其購買力將完全毀滅。此則施行工業統制有損於工農大眾購買力之理由也。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>工業統制政策之有損工農大眾購買力之理由既如上述，而大眾購買力之薄弱實為目前工業衰落之真因，吾人已明瞭。然則，居今而言「挽救垂危之工業」不能施行工業統制而當努力提高大眾之購買力，更無待乎煩言矣。</p>
<h3>日本粉麥自給計畫</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>日本為求小麥生產自給，遂於一九三二年將小麥進口稅自一元半加至二元半。（每担計一百三十三磅）當局曾考慮小麥之消費量，供麪粉製造之用者，凡五百萬石；供釀造及其他用者，凡四百萬石；爰於增高稅率之外，同時更鼓勵農民之原來植稻者，改植小麥。此項計畫，原期五年完成，但時僅三年，已大有進步。在小麥進口稅未增加時，日本小麥市場，常受國外升降之影響，無法防止國內小麥之流出。而麵粉廠之經營，更不啻為投機事業之一種。惟此種現象，自經稅率增加之後，國內之小麥市場，處於關稅壁　保護之下，日趨安定，而各大麵粉公司之營業方釘，亦棄擇機，以博取合理的利潤為目的矣。按諸日本稅律，購自外國之小麥碾成麵粉再行輸出時，可將輸入時所納之稅，於輸出稅中扣除之，均以輸出國外為目標，惟內地之麵粉廠，則以供給國內之消費為主。</p>
<p>一九三四年間麵粉之銷路，尚未脫自一九三一年開始以來之威脅，即一九三一年日本粉業受美國經濟壓迫，與米價低落之影響，更因與米業競爭，不得不抑價應市，雖歐化生活，日形發達，危害麵粉價格，若略形抬高，即食麵包者即改食米飯矣。茲將最近五年來，日本所消耗之麵粉量列左。雖年來小麥之產量日增，然從左表，即可窺見麵粉消費並無進步之一班。（單位千袋）</p>
<p>一九三〇年　三六、四四八</p>
<p>一九三一年　三六、二六六</p>
<p>一九三二年　三二、一二五</p>
<p>一九三三年　三三、四二五</p>
<p>一九三四年　三四、〇〇〇</p>
<p>（注）每袋計重四十八磅。</p>
<p>米之消費量，去年較以前之任何年為高，因農林省曾大量購取至於所需之上也。職是之故。據一般的估計，今年小麥之消費量，或可較高，而達一九三〇年之數字。惟據專家之意見，則謂因農村經濟壓迫之未能解除，營此未必能獲厚利，故今年消費量數字之增加，當不能超出一、〇〇〇、〇〇〇袋。</p>
<p>日本麵粉輸出之大宗為偽滿。惟偽滿之麵粉市場，於一九三四年，亦未見起色。因世界小麥市場之低落，給與澳大利亞麵粉商人以極大競爭之機會。惟今年澳產麵粉，雖仍有輸入偽滿者，但數量漸減，因今年世界麥價，已略高也。若世界之小麥市場，不能回復數年前之高價，則偽滿之麵粉市場，必將為澳產麵粉所操縱。去年十二月間，麥價落漲，於是日本小麥，略見起色。據一般人之估計，今年對偽滿之麵粉輸出，或可達一四、〇〇〇、〇〇〇袋，而造成新紀錄。原因之一為偽滿去年之小麥收穫，殊為惡劣，而必須逢日本大量輸入也。雖日本今年新訂每袋納稅四十錢之稅率，然或可不致影響於對偽滿之輸出。</p>
<p>依現在情形而論，小麥之自給政策，猶不能收絕對禁止小麥輸入之產，因以輸入之小麥，碾成麵粉而輸了時，可得稅率之優遇也。惟將來若能繼續努力於減少稻的栽培，而以農田改植小麥，則輸出日增，輸入日減，自給政策，當不難達於成功之域焉。</p>

<h3>甘肅天水的醫藥界</h3>
<p>— 李康年</p>
<p>天水是被南北二面的高山夾在中間的一個城市，受了地勢的限制，它只能向東西二端發展，因此這個城市的地形是東西長南北狹的。</p>
<p>這裏的人民，至現在還沒有看見汽車火車的機會，交通的工具全賴牲口和人力，飛機（此地設有飛行塲，並有航空隊駐比）的飛降，却是「司空見貫」了。</p>
<p>天水之所以能成爲隴南的重鎭，不僅是商業的繁盛有以促成，而其軍事地位上的重要，也是佔大部份因素。</p>
<p>關於此地醫藥界的情形，表面上似乎已是很發達，但實質上是貧弱得很——診病兼售藥品的舖子雖有十數家，但規模甚少，只是擺着幾種花柳病注射針藥及衛生應用品外，普通藥品是很缺乏的（京貨舖子兼售藥品的也頗有幾家）。</p>
<p>新醫的業務能否發達，往往是和人民的知識水準之高低相正此例，一般無知人民，大多對新醫抱懷疑的不信任態度，家人有害了疾病的，起初是求神拜佛，在菩薩寳座前撮點香灰作藥服治，如果無效，再求舊醫診治，如再無效，到第三步纔找到新醫師，可是一個病人的生命延到這時，已經是危在旦夕，卽使能够救治，也是九死一生了。</p>
<p>如上海的都市，據說醫師的人數往往是有過剩之患的，但在鄉村——尤其西北一帶的鄉村——要找個正式醫師實在不容易，考查正式醫師不能深入內地開業的最大原因：是人民不信任新醫，和一般貧窮的人民出不起醫師診治的代價，所以業務不能發達，卽使有人能深入內地，也多是非常淸淡，甚至日常生活都是難於維持——此地也便和這情形相像。</p>
<p>政府當局對於醫藥衛生事業很是注意，去冬曾實行國醫新醫檢定，新醫方面將事就事的錄取了十數人，幷命各藥舖嗣後如沒有檢定醫師簽字的處方，不准零售藥品，但過後不久，一般人都感覺不便，羣起反對，現在又是可以隨便購買了。</p>
<p>診治一點小病，如注射花柳病針藥之類的診療所是很多，但正式比較有規摸的醫院，除了天主敎堂設有一所外，其餘簡直是沒有。</p>
<p>天主堂醫院由新近從上海來的徐長龢醫師主持，各項設備，頗稱完全，而該院爲慈善性質，對門診不取分文，只取藥費少許，故求診者每日有數十人之多，將來漸爲人民信仰，業務當日臻發達。</p>
<p>陝甘各省，所急待解决的是鴉片毒物之普遍流行，聞政府對比頗爲生意，曾命此間籌設貧民醫院幷戒姻所，惟欵項無着，似一時間尙難實現。</p>
<p>關於公共衛生方面，除了防疫注射和施種牛痘之外，是沒有什麼可說的，一般頑固的人民不明防疫注射的好處，大多表示着不願意。</p>
<p>爲了篇幅，只能這樣簡略的說一點了，但我想，在這短文裏，已可明瞭此地醫藥界情形的一斑了吧。二四，五，一三於甘肅天水城。</p>
<h3>結核之最近觀察</h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>—學說之變遷及其合併療法—</p>
<p>自古以來，結核之學說，雖已有種種之證明，然由今日臨床之實騐，及最近之觀察，則對於結核之學說，已有不少之變遷矣。</p>
<p>結核症之病原，是否完全由於柯赫氏Koch發見之結核菌乎。而自古相傳之結核，Juberkel是否卽爲純粹性之結核症乎。Juberculose</p>
<p>蘇次氏Sohulz觀察各國之文獻，則分爲柯赫氏式與摩虛氏式。Musch</p>
<p>西班牙醫家，如福倫氏及拉伏脫氏Ferran,Ravetta等之觀察，以爲結核之各種形態之變化，乃由於各種細菌之結合及（偶然）變化。Tutntion</p>
<p>法國醫家卡而梅脫氏及福特曼氏CCalmette,　Vaudremer及美國醫家康氏司柰氏Kahn,　Sweany等之觀察，則以爲結核之諸種變態，乃由於結核菌之自己變化所形成。</p>
<p>以前之觀察，如柯赫氏程菌，乃爲純粹之結核病素素。而自古相傳之結核，卽以爲結核病之形成，吾人昔日在學校研究時卽多已知之者，時至今日，其說已不復完全成立矣。</p>
<p>結核之形成，（初期病灶）是否卽爲結核症之起始乎？其學說尙成立乎？</p>
<p>冷克氏Ranke之說曰，結核症之起始，由於初發性之集結而成。Primaerkomplex故結核症之診斷，須待有結核病理解剖上（卽組織上）之變化經過後，方能成立也。</p>
<p>吾人須知每次之傳染，最初乃爲發炎滲出性，Exsudatin其後變爲產生Produktin性結核。（結核性病灶之成立，須有一定之傳染力量，如其傳染力量充足，卽成發炎滲出性及產出性之狀態。——在傳染力量不充足，卽輕度傳染時，雖有局部呈病理解剖上之經過現象，而成爲發炎狀態者，但結核則並不能成立。——普通自以結核之輕度傳染爲最多，此乃毫無疑問者也）。</p>
<p>關於結核症起始之形成，猶有另一種觀察，如一八九七年彼得羅斯克氏Petruschky之觀察，則至今尙爲一般人所公認。卽發炎性之經過，在淋巴腺者，乃屬於結核性，如有發現，卽爲發炎性結核病。蓋結核菌達到口腔或鼻腔及咽喉後，一部分則由氣管粘膜另一部分，或經過胃腸，而達到所屬之局部淋巴腺。此際結核菌亦與其他傳染病菌同，有全被消滅之可能。惟有時因結核菌抵抗力較强，在淋巴腺中能，作長時間之生存，（巴而脫氏Bartel）而達到血行器中。若結核菌達到血行器中，第一道臟腑，卽爲肺部。在學齡兒童十至十二歲時，以百分比例而論，則頸部淋巴腫大，較之肺部爲多，但十二歲至十四歲時則反是。故蘇次氏以爲氣管技淋巴腺者，乃幼童與成人結核之過渡也。</p>
<h3>關於胃液的故事</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之三——</p>
<p>文藝復興期以後，世人開始注意到發生於自然界的所謂「自然變形」的現象。例如：肉爲什麽腐爛？食物爲什麽生蛆？牛乳爲什麽發酸？葡萄汁爲什麽變成酒？蘋果汁爲什麽變成醋？以及，食物爲什麽在胃中起變化？他們以爲這一切都是性質相同的。肉的腐爛，蛆的叢生，牛乳的發酸，食物的消化，都是由於自然變形的作用。</p>
<p>對此懷疑的，第一個是一個意大利人，名叫萊提（Francesco　Redi）的。他把同樣的食物分爲兩部分，一部分給放進開口的瓶子裏，另一部分給放進用羊皮紙及鐵絲紗包紮瓶口的瓶子裏。過了一些時候，開口的瓶子裏的食物生蛆了；另一隻瓶子裏的食物則否，蛆却生在包紮瓶口的羊皮紙上及鐵絲紗上。這証明了「自然變形」學說的不可靠。</p>
<p>一個名叫勞茂（Reanmur）的法國人，飼養着一隻寵愛的鳶。他從它的胃中抽出一些液汁，放入盛食物的瓶中，食物居然溶解了。他又發見，把唾液放在瓶中，亦能改變某種食物，當然是澱粉質的性質。這是一七八二年的事。</p>
<p>一個著名的英國醫學家，名叫享脫（Hunter）的，曾憤激地說：「若干生理學家說胃是磨機；有的說它是發酵桶；有的說它是蒸鍋；但照我的見解，胃不是磨機，也不是發酵桶，也不是蒸鍋—只是一個胃罷了。」但他却沒有說明胃到底是什麼，具有怎樣的機能。</p>
<p>胃有胃液，雖早已被人發見，但學者們對於胃液的功用大抵持荒謬可笑的見解。一八一五年，紐約有一個當時著名的學者，名叫史密士（Nathan　R.　Smith）；他說：「胃液是由許多黏質的小蟲組成的，這些小蟲把走進胃中的食塊呑嚙，使它們變成形式一律的軟糜。」</p>
<p>至於胃液的化學作用的發見，則須歸功於一個偶然發生的意外槍傷事伴。一八二二年六月六日，美國邊境麥克拿克地方一個印第安人，名叫阿里克什斯（Alexis　St.　Martin）的，被槍彈誤傷，他的上腹部的皮膚肌肉和胃臟的外壁給擦碎了。一個年靑的美國軍醫布蒙脫（William　Beanmont）應了延請，來救護這個不幸的犧牲者。他把受傷者的胃的邊緣和皮膚縫接攏來，居然救活了他。他的胃臟這纔有了一個洞眼。布蒙脫看到他的胃動盪着。他看到胃液滲出在胃的表皮上，於是他决定試騐一下。他把一塊肉繫在綫上，塞入阿里克什斯的胃中。半小時候，他把綫拉出來看，肉的邊緣已腐蝕了。一小時後，去了一半。二小時後，全部溶化了。他發見：只在食物進入胃中的時候，或在口中咀嚼着食物的時侯，纔有胃液出現。他用橡皮管把純粹的胃液抽了些出來，送到維基尼亞大學的籐里遜敎授（Propessor　Dunglison）那里去化騐，結果發見胃液含有鹽酸。用週到的化學方法分析純粹的胃液，這是第一次。</p>
<p>布蒙脫决定把阿里克什斯留在家裏，當作僕人，以便繼續研究他的胃臟。但阿里克什斯不是一個馴良的試騐品；他常常喝醉了酒，在試騐的中途逃走了，幾天或幾個月不回來。布蒙脫却耐心等候着，堅持着。到了一八三三年，他自費出版一本關於胃液的實騐與觀察及消化生理（Experiments　and　Observations　onthe　Gastric　Juicei　and　the　Physiology），由紐約布來茲堡地方一家書店發行。這是生理學史上重大事蹟之一。</p>
<p>一八三九年，布蒙脫退出軍隊，在聖路易地方行醫，至一八五二年死在那兒。但他的試騐品却此他後死。阿里克</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>什斯仍然常常喝醉了酒逃走，仍然以「胃生眼」著名。至一八八〇年他纔死。蒙脫里耳一個年輕的生理學敎授奧斯勒（William　Osler）聽到這個消息，便出重金向他的妻購買死人的胃臟。她拒絕他，把丈夫的屍體深埋在地面八呎下，不讓別人掘去。這誠然是可惜的，因爲假如那寡婦答應了奧斯勒的要求，這有眼的胃也許到現在還被保存在美國醫藥博物院裏供我們賞鑒咧。</p>

<h3>耳鼻喉眼衛生常識</h3>
<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（五十四）慢性肥厚性鼻炎（續）</p>
<p>慢性肥厚性鼻炎患者鼻腔所排出的分泌物。大都爲少量粘稠粘液性。有時爲粘液膿性。呈黃色或綠色。若爲純膿性的時候。那就是兼有副鼻腔的化膿。我們如果用鼻鏡來檢查鼻腔。就可察見鼻腔的粘膜。爲灰白色或淺紅色。或爲尋常的色澤。牠的腫脹程度。各有不同。最顯著的是下甲介。次爲中甲介。病人自己往往可以用手指探摸鼻腔。覺得有一塊腫肉在內。這就是腫脹的下甲介。中甲介的位置。比較高而深。所以病人自己是不容易探摸得到的。甲介粘膜的腫脹。雖屬同樣。但是下甲介的前後兩端。大半腫脹顯著。表面平滑而呈半球狀。時而一端具有多數的切痕。變爲凹凸不平。這種情形特稱之爲分葉狀肥大時而牠的後端。變爲乳嘴狀或覆盆子狀。</p>
<p>本病患者往往併發慢性咽頭炎，慢性喉頭炎，副鼻腔疾病，及中耳炎等。這是要注意的。講到牠的治療方法。第一當然是要避去一切致病的原因。次則依照腫脹的性質。施行各種局部的療法。普通所用的幾種。就是鼻腔灌洗法，藥物吹撒法，塗布法，及腐蝕法等等。如果粘膜業已增殖。腫脹高度的時候。那就非行手術不可。手術的方法有三。就是電氣燒灼法，蹄係截斷法及剪除法的三種。這三種手術都無危險。至於三種方法中，究竟用那一種爲適當。這是可由專科醫師斟酌增殖肥厚的情形而决定的。不過往往病家因懼手術的痛苦。而不願手術。以致遷延病勢。併發副鼻腔疾病的狠多。所以遇有本病的時候。還是早期根本治療施行手術爲宜。</p>
<h3>現代花柳病學通俗演講</h3>
<p>— 陳生白（編述）　殷木强（校正）</p>
<p>第二編　淋病</p>
<p>（二）淋菌之抵抗力</p>
<p>甲·對於溫度淋菌對於高溫之抵抗力殊弱。在攝氏四十度以上則數時間而死滅。惟在人體微與在試騐管者異。蓋經數日間四十度以上之體溫。尙不能致淋菌於全滅者有之。其對於低溫之抵抗力。在一〇度以下。迅速死滅。</p>
<p>乙，對於乾燥淋菌對於乾燥之抵抗力頗弱。在全乾燥之處置。可立致死滅。惟在手，襁褓，器具之附有膿汁者。以其乾燥較難。故每有傳染之危險。故在濕潤狀態卽在溫水中。則雖經二時間以上。尙能生活而逞其感染之力力。</p>
<p>丙，對於殺菌劑關於淋菌對殺菌劑之抵抗力。依藥劑之不同。而其程度亦各異。此於淋病之治療上。含有重大之意義。爲吾人所不可不注意之要點。茲據各國學者之實騐。略示其綱要如下。</p>
<p>按淋菌對於殺菌劑之抵抗力最弱者。卽殺菌劑中之最有效力者。當推銀劑。故能善爲應用。則於治療上亦不難得良好之效果。茲將淋菌與銀劑之關係述之。</p>
<p>應用銀劑。使在尿道內發生銀蛋曰。有顯著的阻害菌發育之作用。且如用硝酸銀或Protargol時。該銀蛋白尙有持續之效能。此依實騐的分泌物中所瞪明者也。</p>
<p>不僅試騐對於化學製劑之抵抗力。卽淋菌對於吾人組織之關係。亦爲治療方針上所必要之條件。在組織中。含有蛋白質及食鹽。多數殺菌劑如昇汞，硝酸銀等。每與之結合。形成不溶解性之物質。由試騐之結果。如昇汞，硝酸銀等與蛋日質及食鹽相結合之藥物。較之將淋菌放置於單純水中而作同樣試騐時。其殺菌力爲弱。故如用其他銀製劑如Argentamin,ArgoninPtargol等凝固蛋白及食鹽性較遜的藥劑。其奏效。當更較昇汞，硝酸銀爲顯著。</p>
<p>當然。依試騐管內之試騐。有與實際應用於人體時。大異其趣者。此間所述。蓋略示以治療上之注意點耳。</p>
<p>（三）淋菌之存在部位</p>
<p>關於淋菌之存在部位。本爲臨床醫家之智識。是於檢查淋菌時所當注意者。作者以其事關重要。因述其梗槪。作一般之介紹。</p>
<p>淋菌之存在。依淋病時期而不同。在初期之粘液中。多核白血球尙未出現。此時淋菌多游離於粘液。或附着於表皮細胞面上。而存在於白血球內者較少。逮分泌液帶有膿性。則淋菌之存在於白血球內者。漸次增加。至於末期。則白血球內之淋菌。再見减少。若夫在慢性淋疾。則多游離於分泌液中</p>
<h3>止痛的醫學（廿二）</h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>講到生肛瘻的原因，第一是由肛部膿腫。第二是由於臀部多脂肪，脂肪內血流很少故抵抗力非常低，膿極易伸張，久之成肛瘘。血栓外蘭有時潰爛亦可成肛瘺。肛裂治療不得當時也可變成肛瘻。一部分的肛瘻是癆病。我們曉得癆病無論生在那一部都不易醫好。其次因脂肪對於細菌與化學分解作用抵抗力非常低致肛瘻得成爲最顯著的慢性病。患者雖不多受劇烈痛苦但逐年累月流膿出水也減少人生幸福不少</p>
<p>講止痛必須根本治療。如果毛病不好無法完全除去痛苦。最可靠的治法是正當的外科手術。但馬馬虎虎的外科手術也是等於零，例如將管口割破一點。外科的方法效騐較好的是將瘻管全部割開。也有的外科家完全將瘻管割去，效騐雖有時較好，但手術較爲嚴重。不用外科的治法治愈希望不多，但單管的肛瘻有時注入飽和硝酸銀亦可治愈。動外科雖是短時期內免不了一些疼痛但却是一勞永逸的辦法。此種外科手術結果多是安全不會有特別危險。外科手術旣是最靠得住的辦法。欲避免外科手術最好是預防生肛瘻。要預防，務注意肛門部一切膿腫（俗稱生瘡）宜用相當外科手術將膿放淸。肛裂與內外痔務卽早治療</p>

<p>俗語講，「天有不測風雨人有旦夕禍災」。燙傷火燒於想不到當中可以臨到自己身上。燙燒傷部分大的不是小傷，是一種非常疼痛非常危險的傷。燙燒傷痛較比任何種猛烈痛都有過無不及，因爲燙傷部分的神經接觸器（卽痛覺接觸器）都露在外面。空氣無論熱，冷，乾，濕，或與化學品接觸，或與任何物接觸都要激刺這些接觸器，感覺時時傳到大腦當中，受傷者就時時覺得痛。反過來講痛就是由於曝露的神經接觸器受激刺。若是沒有激刺痛就可以沒有。注意除痛以外大的燙燒傷是直接危害生命的。平均燙燒傷佔全皮膚面積一半以上的常是凶多吉少。燙燒傷死亡的原因如下：火燒時烟氣悶死人。傷後由受驚受傷衰竭發生暴卒。傷後數日內死者常是由於血中毒。再後死亡的是由於傷部潰爛或內部併發症。最後死亡的是由於身體衰竭或乘時而發生的別種毛病，兒童燙燒傷後結果常較成人為嚴重。</p>
<p>治療燙燒傷有兩個大目標。第一是止痛。這種痛是眞應當止的。止痛宜用合乎生理的方法。止痛不應當危害生命。須知不正當的北痛方法是很可以危害生命的。第二是保障生命安全。止痛是屬於人道的，保障生命安全是醫治的最大目的。用最新科學的醫法却是可以起死回生。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（五九）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第五節　肺部以外的呼吸器管——喉結核（續）</p>
<p>關於喉結核之如何治療，提起來也是狠話長的。第一步當然是肺結核本身的治療了！這方面的詳細情形，在後面係另有專章分述的，現在且節去不談。惟喉結核症有」事須特別注意者，卽病者須决對禁止談話是已，這一種手續，如果病家因習慣不能辦到，或不完全辦到，對於病者的損失，是非常重大的。作者敢大膽地說一句，就是：越是病者照醫者所關囑絲毫不苟實行，預後的希望愈大。這一件事情，看似平凡無奇，其實是所關非淺鮮的，希望讀者們都牢記着纔好！如果病者確有要事非面談不可，祇好用筆代語，這在病者方面，非馴練成了習慣不行的！</p>
<p>現今用金屬製劑來治療肺結核症，久已引起醫界的注意了！其實在事實上，對於喉結核確實有許多成績，値得引人重視的。他的用法，是和肺結核症無分彼此的：，至於被治療者究竟適應此製劑與否？以及此劑之利弊，這種種情形，都詳列於「肺結核之治療」專章裏面。鐵勃固靈的注射，也有相當之成效的。</p>
<p>局部藥物的治療，可用五一〇％薄荷油溶液注入喉頭裏面，他係有制腐止痛，使刺激停止，等功效的。關於潰瘍的部分，最好用乳酸腐蝕法；此成份可漸加濃厚，末後可加至百分之八十光景，在塗抹此溶液以前，最好先用高加因溶液麻醉患處。但行使此兩種治療手續，一定要經過專家用喉鏡監視方行的。尤以乳酸溶液腐蝕太甚，如果塗抹他處，結果黏膜反遭損壞，與本症係絲毫無補的。嚥下因劇痛而過分困難者，可外用高加因等溶液塗抹。飲食以粥狀帶冷者爲宜；過分稀薄的液體，以及溫熱之食品，均不宜服。此外，若人工太陽燈及鐳錠局部使用法，電氣燒灼法，對於局部的疾患，也有成效可睹的。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論想像</h3>
<p>— 林芷英</p>
<p>如果我們涉獵及古典的現實主義諸作品，則在實際上，那些作品裏面往往有着一種豐富的，剛美的，新鮮的「空想」或「幻想」力存在着。比方：果戈理的「五月之夜」，普式庚的「皇后牌」，高爾基的「母親」……這些作品，是屬於現實主義的；可是那內容却穿貫着健康的空想的要素。像「五月之夜」和「皇后牌」中的「鬼」，以至於「母親」的結構，都是出於作者的健康而強烈的想像（Fantasy）而來的。這些作品，都抓住了現實的核心，在世界的文學史，入出燦爛的光芒！</p>
<p>這是為什麼呢？</p>
<p>原來藝術是概括和綜合現實的，然而藝術家並不是像會計一樣，把一切日常煩瑣的事項收攏在一起，再清算出一個總賬來的。藝術家（恕我大胆地說一句）是人類認識現實，改變現實的馬前卒！看着文學史上偉大的作家們吧，他們有意或無意地是歷史現實的新的發展要素的發現者，表現者，科學學的發明，是發現科學的法則中的新的發展要素。就是說，他的發明並不是從「無」中造出來的，而是根據正確的，嚴密的，尖銳的推理得來的。物質的運動法則不斷地發展，嚴峻的科學家會在這發展的過程中發現新的成果。藝術家也同樣地，他視察現實，研究現實，因此發現現實發展中的新的要素，由此來創造出各種的典型。由於那作家對於他所發現的現實的新要素所抱的態度，創造出沒落的，動搖的，前進的各種典型來。在這裏很明白的有他的世界觀在作巨大的作用，然而也同樣很明白的，他不是從空虛的「主觀」造出各種的典型來的。</p>
<p>拿一個最「空想」的作品來說。比方像十九世紀末期英國「拉斐爾前派」（Pre-Raphaelitism）的作家莫利斯（William　Morris）所作的鳥托邦的（Utopian）小說「虛無鄉消息」（News　from　No　where）這是一本運用濃厚想像的小說，寫一種未來的快樂的理想社會的情形。但這並不是莫利斯憑着自己的主觀隨便描畫出來的，這是當時的英國社會，呈現出了私有制度的，金錢的，機械的罪惡，換句話說，就是當時的社會條件，使唯美派的莫利斯起了對於現實的不滿，所以他對着私有，金錢，機械這些東西，寫出沒有貨幣的，沒有機械的想像中的社會來。可是在世界觀的限制之下，莫利斯的想像力不能得到健全的發展，譬如他之否定機械，否定工業，把未來社會想像成一同古典的手工業的世界的圖畫這就是他的認識的缺憾。</p>
<p>由上面的敘述，我們可以看出二點重要的結論來：第一，文學藝術既然是着重於創造，着重於「發明」，那末，所謂「空想」或「幻想」Fantasy　是非存在這個創作過程裏不可的。如果我們為避免字義的誤會，可以把「空想」或「幻想」挽說為「想像」。想像——是藝術的一個重要的原素或手段。第二，所謂想像，不應該是空洞的「主觀」的觀念，而應該配合於現實發展的法則，不能象莫利斯那樣讓想像的下半身陷入於自己的主觀裏，背反了歷史的發展：應該像高爾基那樣，讓自己的主觀和客觀的歷史發展吻合了，產生出健全的想像來。</p>
<p>怎樣才能使自己的想像健全呢？這是要靠作家的生活的實踐去鍛煉。我們知道這一種既成的世界觀，是不輕易變化的，這種世界觀的發展，靠着三個主要的因素：（一）自己的生活，（二）理論的研究，（三）創作的實踐。高爾基的豐富的生活經驗，玄博的研究，細心的寫作，就是現在希望向前的作家的一個最上的例子。青年的藝術學徒如果能在這三方面上努力，那想像就不能不是健全的，因為在這過程中，認真的人們的世界觀，會逐漸走上正確的道路。</p>
<p>從前自然主義派的現實主義者，也異常着重生活的體念。沙克萊（W.M.Thackeray）描寫這樣的人們中一個說「他巡視倫敦之一切的角落，觀察酒店的炭礦夫與河岸，郊外的各街道的泥醉者，他窺看一切，祇要能夠為自己的作品蒐集材料，即與扒手交杯也在所不辭。」左拉（Emile　Zola）在他的「實驗小說」裏，也反對「純粹虛構和純粹想像的小說」而提倡「實驗的小說」，他不知道「向着真實突進的藝術」，並不能停止在現象上，而是需要一種正確的想像力去幫助它的。而且左拉自己的作品，也未曾全然離開過想像，不過想像在他的藝術裏佔的地位不重要就是了。</p>
<p>健全的想像力的發展，結果是形成健全的浪漫主義。這是提高藝術的反映現實及其社會效果的唯一重要的因素。我們應該為健全的想像，為新文學而努力！</p>
<h3>樓上的一對</h3>
<p>— 胡考</p>
<h3>丁律小景</h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>新加坡印象記之二</p>
<p>整天被火車的轟轟聲震動着耳膜，馬來亞的吸血鬼在這晨安置下動靜脈的心房。成天見火車的動脈運去營養整個馬來亞的新鮮的血液：貨物，糧食和苦力，而靜脈載回來吮吸來的生產原料。整天見烟囪吐着黑烟，而汽笛的尖銳聲叫醒殖民地子民的夢。</p>
<p>此外丁律保持着靜寂。炎炎的太陽下很少行人；電車擦出幽悠的聲調。</p>
<p>深夜偶或被困在一家樓上，寂寞地聽丁律吉靈人的教堂發出叮噹的鐘聲。大風吹時，屋後的大樹搖曳着暗影，發出了簌簌之聲。</p>
<p>前面的皇家山上永遠升降的指示海航的旗幟，在月亮光時偶或可以看見一二個小小的人影。</p>
<p>隣近着的是總督衙門。黃昏時可以看見由各種人組成的出操歸來的帝國義勇軍。柏油道上響着整齊的皮鞋着地聲，軍樂奏着偉壯的示威的音調。</p>
<p>附近的街道滿佈着住宅。小阜上的屋宇在黑夜時泛出一幅樹蔭的巨影，月亮光時小徑旁邊的青草反映出一顆顆銀白色的露珠。</p>
<p>一直到「大實森節」，丁律才擠滿了各式各樣的人。神的出遊轟動了全新加坡，吉靈人似乎才被人家所認識。</p>
<p>黃昏的風是冷寂而清涼的；海吹來印度洋的風。滿佈在「吉靈廟」的附近，吉靈人的苦力裸着赤臂，商人的階沿；馬來婦人賣着香蕉和香烟，馬來人頂着一個小筐喊賣小豆。</p>
<p>丁律永遠是一幅靜物的繪畫：寂寞時可領會畫情詩意，熱鬧時也不過是一幅人間小小動亂的繪圖。</p>
<h3>廣告</h3>
<p>— 辛卓佳</p>
<p>我的長篇小說愉要出版了，我非常高興。我本想跑出去告訴我的許多朋友，要他們和我道謝的；但天突然落起大雨來，沒有雨具，我就祇得像關在雞　中的雞一般的關在亭子間裏了。</p>
<p>我的腦子使我一刻兒都不能安靜，我老想着我的書出版以後將得到怎樣的毀譽與批評。我吸着一根香烟靠在窗口上，眼睛望着那數不清的雨絲，心裏不安地，頻繁地衝擊着。</p>
<p>對於批評家，我一向是討厭他們，看不起，而又有些害怕他們的。他們差不多都不曾知道作家創作的艱難，和作品主題的高深的意義。甚至於可以說：他們什麼都不懂。他們讀你的作品，就是像蒼蠅叮食物似的，不管是香的，臭的，他們還沒有叮到食物上面嚐出食物的味道，就老遠老遠地，嗡嗡　　地哼了起來。並且還得意地告訴人家說：『這就是我的對於這部作品的最確切地批評呀！……』</p>
<p>我的長篇小說，我很知道：是不會討得批評家的歡心的。他們一定看不出來的的隱藏在作品中間的高深的意義，他們一定不耐煩的，剛剛開場產就會看不下去，他們決不會知道我的作品的精彩的部份在什麼地方。再加以，我的名字又是他們所生疏的。當然……一定。不過，我還並不十分着急，主要的，還是讀者。</p>
<p>我對於讀者，是很有些把握的。但偶一轉念：讀者有時候也會盲目地跟着批評家跑，聽信着批評家的造謠和污蔑，心裏就又有些惶惶地不安起來。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>「中國一般的文化水準的確還是太低了些！」我這樣深深地感慨着。</p>
<p>外面的風雨更加大了，我丟掉手中的半截香烟頭，開始離開窗口，在房間中來回地走着。我竭力的要丟開着壞的這一方面的心思，朝好的一方面想：有了這樣好的，偉大的一部作品，也許馬上就會另外產生出一個新的，偉大的批評家來的。當然，我的作品並不難讀，祇要他稍為有一點兒文藝理論的基礎，還稍為有點讀偉大作品的耐性，就夠資格來讀我的作品的。那時候，他的批評一定會因我的作品而成名；我呢，也就能得到我在文壇上應得的地位了。</p>
<p>這樣地想着，我的心裏就又慢慢地安靜起來。我渴望着馬上有一兩個朋友從雨中跑來探望我，談談心，商量商量書出版後用怎樣的方法來宣傳和介紹。</p>
<p>突然地，我的房門響了。我還沒有來得及轉過身去，　看見書店里的伙記，渾身淋得像落水鬼似的闖進了我的房間，並且恭敬地，　歡似的笑着。</p>
<p>「先生，好啦！」</p>
<p>「送板稅來的嗎？」我連忙問。</p>
<p>「不是，先生。板稅要等出版以後到經理先生那里去支，我是來找先生討張廣告的。」</p>
<p>「廣告？」</p>
<p>「是的，先生。」</p>
<p>「誰的廣告呀？」</p>
<p>「就是先生的那部長篇小說呢。」他說着，抖了一抖雨衣上的水珠，並且坐了下來，告訴我：因為他們的廣告主任看不懂，也看不完我的長篇小說，所以他呌他來找我替自己的小說寫一張廣告的。</p>
<p>我不由生起氣來了：</p>
<p>「他看不懂我的小說嗎？」</p>
<p>「不是，先生。他是什麼人的書都看不懂，什麼人的書都看不完的。並且他也沒工夫統統看。」</p>
<p>「那麼其他的人的書呢？」</p>
<p>「也大半都是請其他的先生自家作的。」</p>
<p>我昂頭想了一想，心里覺得怪不舒服：「原來……」但是，突然地，有一種另外的，不可告人的秘密，湧上我的心頭了。</p>
<p>「人家知道了不會笑話嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，沒有關係；先生，這是人家不知道的。」</p>
<p>我呌他坐在我的床邊等着，我提起筆來，先在紙上畫了張廣告的式樣。於是，我的對於自己作品所要說而怕人家說不出，說不好的許多評語，便像潮水似的衝激了起來。什麼批評家，讀者，朋友……一概都從我的心潮中衝跑得無影無踪了。好像祇要有人能看得到我的廣告，就什麼都無須顧慮了似的，寫道：</p>
<p>「這是一位青年作家餓着肚皮，費了三年半艱苦的時光，寫出來的一部偉大的長篇小說。這里面有「戰爭與和平」那樣不可一世的才氣，有「鐵流」那樣洗鍊的寫法，有「士敏土」那樣沸騰的熱情，「有希羅斯基」的鬧忙和「十二把椅子」的諷刺……作者因此一躍而登世界文壇的最高峯，是不無原因的。……印刷精美，定價低廉……假如你還不趕快趁機會買一本，將來一定會要後悔得自殺的……」</p>

<p>希望的歡欣像陣陣微風，</p>
<p>憑空兒，會在深淵中</p>
<p>浮出一個渦旋……</p>
<p>激越的心弦彈起</p>
<p>飄渺中一絲兒幽曲，張開雙眼，</p>
<p>瞅視着黑野中隱隱約約的</p>
<p>那茫茫天涯：</p>

<p>瞅一瞅——那黑野中</p>
<p>隱隱約約的茫茫天涯，</p>
<p>舉手擱在胸口，</p>
<p>肉製的心房兒</p>
<p>畢竟還不曾變成冷石堅鐵，</p>
<p>就伸開堅實的脚步，</p>
<p>一個個跡印，一個個落在後面。</p>

<h3>大學時代（十）（八）</h3>
<p>— 德施國托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>此時我不知覺走近前去，直走至周圍經繞的鐵絲旁邊。——坐在褐馬上面的，是我的朋友克里斯多夫底妹妹。但是還來了一個騎馬的女孩，一個漂亮的面孔；他斜坐着懶懶地，在一隻驚馬上面。現在她慢慢轉近來了，她把頭掉過來，微笑地向周圍一看。——這是娜麗；我吃了一驚，四肢發起抖來了，她也認出我了；但她的眼睛惶惑地看着我的眼睛，祇有一秒鐘長久；接着她把身子向旁邊屈下去，裝做整理衣裳的樣子。她的小拳頭拿着那把沉重的鍜劍，似乎不是學不意思的，因為這劍串滿了鐵環，幾乎串到了劍把上面。</p>
<p>此時木馬盤老闆走進來了，他來收下次轉動的錢。她立了起來，把鍜劍給他看。「我是包坐的！」她說，同時把劍倒轉來，讓鐵環落在老闆手裏。</p>
<p>他點點頭，就走到其他的坐位去，那裏有好多小朋友正在爭奪較好的位子。——當我的眼睛從那裏再轉向娜麗時候，克里斯多夫底妹妹恰站在她旁邊，便她背對着我，似乎不覺得我也在這裏。</p>
<p>「你同我回去麼？」我聽她問，「我是必須回家去的。」</p>
<p>娜麗沒有立刻回答；她的眼睛用一種不定眼光向我飄過來。我一點不敢動彈；但我的眼睛回答了她，我的嘴唇低低地說「留着吧！」說得我自己都聽不見。</p>
<p>「說話啊！」那一個催迫她，「八點種已經敲過了。」娜麗又把雙脚放在踏鐙裏去，她本來離開踏鐙了；她的眼睛看着我，回答說：「我還不回去，我是包坐的！」又低聲地加上一句說：「我的母親也許要在這裏過路的。」</p>
<p>我覺得這話是說謊。</p>

<h3>陸徵祥</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>中國軍政界要人，每一下野，除了一輩因厭倦軍政生涯，自動休隱去做寓公，和一班以退爲進，暫時出洋，以待再起的而外，還有不少是皈依宗敎，以度其唸經祈禱的歲月。前兩種人多得很，舉不勝舉。後一種人，如吳佩孚孫傳芳，他們是佛門的弟子，陸徵祥，他是基督的信徒。這三個人，他們從前都曾握過國家的大權，顯赫一時，而現在皆已變成宗敎的虔信者。其中尤以陸徵祥最爲有名。據二十九日報載：陸徵祥今日在比國勃稱琪城附近聖安德肋敎堂受任爲天主敎神甫，聖名彼得賽勒斯丹，該敎堂懸有敎皇國旗及中比國旗，四方人士前往觀禮者，不下千人，敎皇亦有賀詞致陸云。</p>
<p>陸徵祥於一九一二年，曾任前北京政府國務總理。於一九二七年，因其比利時籍的夫人逝世後，悲痛萬分，乃棄官於是年十月四日、以鄭重儀式，入比國聖安德肋修道院，爲聖本篤信敎士。自是而後，卽一心皈依天主敎，過其修道的生活。光陰荏再，轉眼已是八個年頭了。敎會因其平日虔誠修道，故今特晋授司鐸的職位，這是何等的光榮。</p>
<p>陸徵徵前任北京政府國務總理時，對於國家的功罪如何，這自有事實作判斷，不必去論它。惟聞陸氏自放棄政治生涯，赴比入天主敎修道院後，對於祖國，還是愛護非常，未嘗因其身爲異國敎徒，便把中國忘却。這一點是很値得敬仰的。如九一八東北事變時，他憤慨極了，立刻發表了許多有力的言論，向歐洲各國呼援，得到各國不少的同情。又如這一次，他榮任神甫之職，在典禮完成之後，卽致電回國，聲稱其第一次禱吿，卽爲祈求上帝賜福中國。其一片愛國的熱誠，大足以喚起國人的醒悟。陸徵祥是我國的國民，現在雖做了外國的神甫，到底尙沒有忘記了中國的同胞和中國的國家，我國民之饘斯粥斯的，更深望勿忘記了我中華民國的國家。</p>
<h3>水榭</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>太陽懶懶地照到水榭的欄杆上，那條臭水浜里就幌動着無數水蛇那樣怕人的影子。老闆下意識地抬起被烟煤熏壞了的眼睛，像中午時侯的貓一樣，瞇成一條綫，向樓梯對面的穿衣鏡瞧去，鏡里映着他自己矮小的身材；樓梯上也不見響聲。那個和水榭同樣古老的時鐘偏偏在這時候打了兩　，老闆的胸前就像被鐵錘擊了兩下一樣。</p>
<p>黃梅雨繼續了三數天，沒有一個人上水榭來，雨奪去了老闆的飯碗，他祈求，焚了香燭，叩了無數響頭，果然今日放晴。一早太陽探到窗前，老闆的癟臉上展開了了笑容，一骨碌從地上爬起來，一隻猴子什麼的捲起被褥，　到爐灶旁邊，舉起鐵筷通煤屑，手臂裏滿是勁！</p>
<p>熟練地在爐灶上鋪了一層木片，擦火柴，扇風箱，添媒，蛇舌般的火燄幾乎舐上老闆的眉毛。提水，盛滿銅吊，架上爐灶，又轉過身來掃地。地上沒有什麽，幾天沒有人來嚼瓜子，又放了掃帚取抹布。桌面薄薄鋪着一層塵灰，一個大肚皮的蜘蛛在桌脚中間張起一面網。媽的，你也來欺人，想着，抹布一揮，老闆佔了勝利，得意地笑了癟臉變了</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>一個大餅，分不淸鼻子和眼睛。</p>
<p>坐定身，想起沒有抹臉。銅吊的長頸嘴裏已噴着濃厚的白烟。用手指抓住眼窩，眼角上結着一堆屎，兩天沒有生爐子，兩天沒有抹臉。像誰出了這個壞主意似的，老闆第一次用沸水抹臉，還用胰子，這不是浪費，心裏安慰着，抹去這堆悔氣！</p>
<p>銅面盆里變了顏色，像臭水浜里一樣黑。嘩—啦—去牠媽的，悔氣！老闆的面盤拉長了，不是生氣。</p>
<p>忽然聽見脚步什麼的饗着，老闆直着耳朶，像一頭驢子，自然貓眼珠注視着穿衣鏡。半響，老闆不敢霎一霎幾乎發痛的眼睛，鏡子里沒有影子，自己的矮身材，他認得的。開玩笑？躡着脚尖爬到樓梯頭，猛地挺起身來，樓下一片黑暗，沒有開門！擊着腦壳子，一個皮球打在鍵盤上那麼的—頓！頓！頓！老闆滾下樓梯。</p>
<p>黑暗里摸着門撑，滑汕油地，像摸着一條蛇，老闆跳了起來，普通人一樣高！退後兩步，側轉身子，借下面射下來的陽光，醫生探視顯微鏡里的病菌那樣：從門撑的上端到下截，側裏到正中！沒有什麽？再探上手去，滑汕油地，門撑浮面冒着一層細小的水珠。黃梅天，木頭出汗。打開門，陽光如一支箭，射到樓梯脚，老闆眼睛發花：有人？—不是，一只花貓躥了進來。</p>
<p>對門的石橋樑背發着光。近處，遠處，每一堆水窪里有一個太陽。一株石榴樹開着鮮紅的花朵來歡迎老闆盼望着　　　　　　頭上壓着一担菜，滿滿地，那個筐子有老闆那樣高，爬上橋樑，老五哥的身體彷彿一隻煮熟的蝦，頭可以碰着脚尖。</p>
<p>—老五哥，幾天沒有上街？</p>
<p>老五哥沒有停步，兩筐菜的重量壓着他停不來脚。</p>
<p>—矮脚王，回頭我送幾顆菜來，三天沒有嘗油了？</p>
<p>笑聲過橋去了。老冬瓜，壓死了不得回來！老闆心裏罵着跳上樓去了；他還有工作—那架子上的一長烈茶壺。</p>
<p>爐灶上的銅吊，長嘴頸裏呼着白氣，彷彿罵着老冬瓜，惡有惡報！老闆想，那傢伙一定死在半路。</p>
<p>但是那種脚步什麽的聲音又響了起來，這回他聽明白了；是壁上的鐘。牠像一個破落戶的書香子弟，搖動着沉纍的鐘擺：拆拆！拆！拆光完結，可是迅速地動手洗拭茶壺，今天是大太陽哩。</p>
<p>吃過中飯，老闆三天沒有嘗過油，開水冲冷飯，肚子塡了個半飽，他要把餘下來的留到明天，雖然他預計着今天有五十壺的好生意。</p>
<p>於是他望着樓梯頭的穿衣鏡，望着水榭底下的橋樑。太陽跑得眞快，已經抹上欄杆，少爺式的時鐘，像吃飽了什麽似的拚命跑，這要拚掉俺矮脚王的老命呢！這鎭上的人都是短命鬼，不會享福！</p>
<p>儘你罵沒有一個鬼上門，老闆提起銅吊，把罵老冬瓜的沸水注到爐灶裏，！嗤嗤，像這水榭一樣，完了命！</p>
<p>悔氣！大淸早碰着那短命鬼！老闆望着那些翻着白眼的煤球，他估計着一天的糧食底代價無形犧牲了！</p>
<h3>夜泊崖門</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>我愛海行，汹湧的狂濤好像反映出我的生命似的。</p>
<p>就是這樣的流浪的日子，我跑過繁華的都市，我踏過荆棘的山林。當我從高峯上帶著疲乏的調子下來的時候，必然的，我又跨上了火船或是一些小小的拖渡里，飄過碧綠的每水，去找尋我的美麗的影子。</p>
<p>爲了自己的慾望，我從一個繁雜的都市的碼頭上跨上了一隻開往南海的海　面去的不怎麽大的火船里。這一次的海程就要經過汹湧的巨浪的崖門。——這兒是歷史上挺有名的地方，俗傳崖門的海底。深得非常，從崖門的海面眺望着岸邊，可以看見一座叢生着綠樹和峭險的巖石，在許久許久以前，南宋末年的陸秀夫，負着皇帝沉沒在這個可怕的海面——如今，我又有一個很好的機會，要飄過這巨浪的崖門了。</p>
<p>火船還未曾飄出海面的時侯，沒有什麼波浪，平靜的，黃昏的太陽弛鬆而疲乏地反照着廣闊的河面，兩岸的巖石給輕微的浪花盪激着，透出來的一定的音調，海風飄着岸上的林梢而透出來的哨聲，跟着一些鳥兒的吱喳的聲音。這些海上所聽到的聲音，總可以使我感不到海航的寂寞，這時候，我靠着甲板上的欄杆眺望着，等到黑夜的來臨，海面儘是一幕看不淸楚的黝黑，深藍色的天空裏的稀疏的小星兒反映着海水的時候，我才躺在床上。</p>
<p>因爲疲乏得很！我很快地就熟睡了</p>
<p>不知道是什麽時候，我給巨浪的衝擊，船身的拋盪而驚醒了，揉了一揉疲乏的眼珠子，瞪着艙裏的人們，大部分的人們都是睡着的，那淡黃色的電燈反映着人們很着的臉孔！越看越是可怕的。於是，我很害怕地閉上了眼睛，但是我的耳朶跟腦袋都是非常靈敏的！我聽着火船的機器的轟隆轟隆的聲音。然而，我感到最害怕的是巨大的波浪一上一下的把船身拋盪着，自己好像被吊在天空中一樣。外面刮着大風，嗚嗚……沙……沙……儘是一幕可怕的掙扎。到了這樣的時候，無論那個人都感到害怕的吧！</p>
<p>過了一會兒，我聽到甲板外的水手們在嚷奔跑着，跟着拋了錨，火船也停了下來，然而，風浪依然是一樣衝擊着火船的，船身依然是拋呀拋的。把全部的旅客都驚醒了起來，他們都睜着眼珠子的說：</p>
<p>「多可怕，這風浪是很少口的。但是火船爲什麽泊在崖門呢？」</p>
<p>「恐怕不能够過去吧，看樣子，再開船是不成了。</p>
<p>人們這樣嚷着，我的　袋才想起宋朝的時候那個陸秀夫只駕着小艇兒到這里，就是他不自殺也會給巨浪噬掉了。想着，我不禁顫抖了起來。我只得又三一上了眼珠子，默默地。然而，因爲巨浪不停的拋盪着的，我已漸漸地感到挨不住了，而且胸部志忑地作嘔的樣子，腦袋的昏眩，……實在，我在海行的時候很少「暈浪」的。這一次不能不算是例外了。</p>
<p>好像失了知覺似的，挨過了恐怖的黑夜，風浪也小了一點兒，我才跑到甲板上去。望着還迷在雲霧里的崖山，望着一起一伏的波浪的海面，那時，東方的太陽美麗地映着海面，白鷗們跚跚地飛翔，一切的可愛的海景給我陶醉了。</p>

<h3>Han River Water Rises Sharply: Enters Extremely Severe Period; Torrential Rain in Wuhan Yesterday: Streets and Alleys Flooded and Difficult to Drain; Hanyang Parrot Island Submerged; Labor Conscripted to Rescue Wuhui Embankment</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The river water rose to 48 feet on the morning of the 7th, 9 feet higher than the same day in the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931], and has entered the extremely severe period stipulated by the Flood Prevention Association. The Wuchang Wuhui Embankment is still not out of danger. The authorities have conscripted tens of thousands of residents from the sixth and seventh districts to rescue it. Jinkou Upper Street was flooded, Hanyang Parrot Island was submerged, and the disaster victims are sheltering on the embankment. The situation is extremely tragic. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Torrential rain poured down in Wuhan at noon on the 7th, becoming even heavier in the evening. Low-lying streets and markets were flooded with deep water, and the river water rose at the same time, reaching a water level of 48 feet 5 inches. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director of the Flood Control Association Cheng Renwu, and Construction Director Liu Shoupeng, Director of the Flood Prevention Association Xiao Mian, respectively braved the rain to inspect the embankment works at the Hankou Dikou and Wuchang embankment works and supervise the repair work. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) This afternoon, there was heavy rain here, and half of the low-lying areas of the concession were flooded. This was caused by the torrential rain having nowhere to drain. The river water rose about one foot today, totaling 48 feet 5 inches, higher than the ground of the concession, level with the riverbank, but has not exceeded the safety point of the wall embankment. Major commercial firms are now taking various precautionary measures. All goods on the lower floors of warehouses have been moved to the upper floors. Opposite the Hankou Great Embankment, a giant lake has formed, extending several miles, with boats traveling in it. Many villages elsewhere have been submerged. Zhang Xueliang inspected the river embankment and flood control work yesterday, and then consulted with Wuchang officials on everything. The Changde correspondent of the Hankou Western newspaper said that the northern city river embankment had collapsed, and many streets in Changde were flooded, with water reaching waist-deep, resulting in considerable losses. It is reported that the water level in Yichang is rising, so the river water in Hankou is feared to continue to rise. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The upper reaches of the Jiangxiang continue to rise. Xiangyang Yuekou rose sharply by more than four meters on the 7th, Yichang rose by three feet eight inches, and Changsha rose by one foot four inches. The water head will arrive in Hankou within days, and public panic has reached its extreme. The riverbank of Hankou city is submerged by more than a foot, and it is difficult to drain the sewage from the sewers. The water outside the Zhanggong Embankment is higher than the urban area. Along the Han River in Hanyang, the water will rise above the embankment surface. The residences of the river street people are flooded several feet deep. On the night of the 6th, a flash flood suddenly arrived in Hanchuan County, with a water head of twelve feet high, and the people's houses were flooded more than six feet deep. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Wuhui Embankment, which is related to the safety of the provincial capital, has developed cracks due to the inclination of the sluice gates at both ends, and a dangerous situation has formed. Wuchang County Magistrate Yang Shisheng is conscripting labor to rescue it on the one hand and sending letters to local wealthy gentry to form a Wuhui Embankment Rescue Committee to jointly plan flood control measures on the other. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou water level is 48 feet, a sharp increase of seven inches compared to the 6th. Torrential rain poured down from 4:00 PM on the 7th until 5:00 PM, and it is still continuing. The future water situation is becoming more severe, and people feel quite uneasy. According to the Jianghan Customs water level report, Yichang is 48 feet 9 inches, Yuezhou is 50 feet 3 inches, and Changsha is 27 feet, all of which are increasing without end. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, returned to Hankou after inspecting the embankment works in Yisha Xiangfan. According to his statement, the water rise in the upper reaches of the Xiang River is even more severe than in Wuhan, and the situation is dangerous. He is determined to defend the embankment with all his strength and protect the safety of Wuhan. The Economic Committee has approved an allocation of 200,000 yuan for flood control expenses, and 100,000 yuan has already been remitted. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Headquarters convened a flood prevention conference of heads of various agencies at 9:00 AM on the 7th. He Chengjun and others attended. Qian Dajun presided on behalf of Zhang Xueliang. As a result of mutual discussion, the responsible agencies were to strictly protect the embankment and prevent floods. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) At 8:00 PM on the 7th, the Jianghan Customs water level record was 48.5 feet, with a continuing upward trend. Heavy rain is still continuing. The water on low-lying roads can submerge the knees. The area around Special District Three has prepared sandbags, and the flood control work is extremely tense. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Flood Prevention Work in the Capital City</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The highest water level at Xiaguan in the capital city on the 7th was 53.86 meters, equivalent to 6845 meters on the Maritime Customs scale of the Hydraulic Engineering Society, and has not continued to rise. The Jinggong Bureau has decided to install water pumps in low-lying areas on both sides of Rehe Road and Huimin River to drain the accumulated water. The embankments have been raised and reinforced with soil. A total of thirty-one gaps in the wharves along the river have been equipped with floodgates, and five water pumps have also been installed at Xishuiguan to pump water from the 8th onwards. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The highest water level in Zhenjiang on the 7th was 0.682 meters at the Wusong River, 1.06 meters lower than the highest water level in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], and 1.13 meters higher than the highest level on the same day last year. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mountain Torrent Erupts: Ping-Sui Railway Tracks Destroyed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) In the Jilebao Zhoushizhuang area of the Ping-Sui Railway, the railway tracks were submerged and destroyed by a mountain torrent for more than twenty spans, causing delays in all trains on the line and resulting in significant losses. The railway is now rushing to send craftsmen to intensify the construction. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A section of the railway tracks between Jilebao and Zhoushizhuang on the Ping-Sui Railway was washed away by a mountain torrent on the night of the 6th, causing traffic obstruction. The railway bureau is currently trying to repair it. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Longhai Railway: Embankment Bridge Washed Away by Water</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) There was heavy rain in Shaanxi Province, and a mountain torrent erupted. The embankment bridge on the Longhai Railway was washed away by the water, and trains cannot pass temporarily. The Railway Bureau telegraphed Xuzhou on the morning of the 7th, saying that express trains heading west can reach Tongguan, and instructed them to sell tickets to Tongguan. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Railway News: There was heavy rain in Xi'an, and the newly built roadbed of the western section of the Longhai Railway was not solid and was eroded by water. Although it was not destroyed, train travel is dangerous. From the 6th, passenger trains from Tongguan to Xi'an were temporarily suspended at Xuzhou Station. On the 7th, only passenger tickets to Tongguan were sold, with western trains only going as far as Tongguan. The railway said that traffic could be restored immediately after the rain stopped and repairs were made. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Water Rises in Various Rivers in Shaanxi: Pingmin County to Relocate Administration</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) There has been continuous rain in Shaanxi Province for days, day and night without ceasing. All river hydrological stations have telegraphed to report rising water levels, and the summer flood season is approaching. Long-distance telephone lines in various counties have been cut. Shao Lizi ordered all counties to quickly replant autumn crops on the one hand and ordered all counties along the rivers to strictly prevent floods on the other. Pingmin County is preparing to relocate its administration to avoid flooding. The water level in the Han River is also rising and flowing downstream. According to general observations, the summer flood season is feared to be unavoidable. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) The surveying team of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission measuring the water level between Tongguan and Xianyang has arrived in Tongguan and is conducting measurements westward. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yongding River: Central Channel Dredging Project Completed</h3>

<h3>Hunan Provincial Relief Association: Requests Further Allocation of Funds for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Hunan Provincial Relief Association has telegraphed the Central Government to report disasters in eleven counties including Changning and request the allocation of national currency for relief. It telegraphed again yesterday, saying that various counties including Changde, Nanxian, and Ningxiang have successively suffered disasters, dykes and weirs have collapsed, and fields and houses have been flooded. Not only is the autumn harvest hopeless, but the current living conditions of the disaster victims are truly unsustainable. Please issue relief funds in conjunction with the case. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou: Another Gale and Rainstorm Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) In the provincial capital, at 1:30 PM on the 7th, there was a gale and rainstorm that lasted for fifty minutes before stopping. Residents of the Xiaobei district plan to jointly petition the Public Works Bureau for relief. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Urgent Telegrams Arriving from Various Places; Dangerous Situation with Rising Water Upstream; Qin Fen and Fu Rulin Departed Yesterday for Inspection; Jiangling Embankment Collapses and Water Floods Jingzhou County; Yichang River Water Rises Ashore and Jiujiang Embankment is in Danger</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Committee, Fu Rulin, Director of the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, along with experts Pu Deli, Zheng Zhaojing, Wu Youxin, Chen Jinmo, and others, departed on the morning of the 7th, first to Wuhu to inspect. Liu Zhenhua arranged to meet in Wuhu. In the afternoon, Qin and others sailed upstream. Qin Fen said that according to the telegram report from Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, the water situation upstream is urgent, and although the situation is bad, no dangerous signs have occurred in the main embankments in Hankou, but many civilian embankments have collapsed in the meantime. Supervision and flood prevention cannot be relaxed in the slightest. We are sailing upstream to inspect along the way. We will have considerable stays in Wuhu and Jiujiang. If we recognize any dangerous situation, we will work with the flood prevention agencies of each province to do our best to rescue and protect. It is planned to inspect to Hankou and urge the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to strictly protect it. If necessary, we will go to Yichang to inspect, but it has not yet been decided. The date of this trip is difficult to determine, and it will take about five or six days to return to the capital. Fu Rulin said that the Yangtze River water level has risen sharply, and I will supervise the flood prevention area along the way. When I arrive in Hankou, I will have a detailed consultation with the flood prevention agencies. The return journey is undecided. Before Qin Fen's departure, he telegraphed the construction bureaus and river affairs bureaus of various provinces along the Yangtze River, who are responsible for flood prevention, to carry out strict protection and telegraph early at any time the handling situation. As for the collapse of various civilian embankments in Hankou, what they rely on for protection is the main embankment. The protection is particularly important. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau was also telegraphed to strictly protect it, so as to avoid negligence. Although the water situation is urgent at present, fortunately no major changes have occurred. The Economic Committee's current approach is to focus on urging the rescue measures of the flood prevention agencies of various provinces. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the dangerous rise of water along the river, Qin Fen received two telegrams from Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, on the 6th. (1) The Hankou water level today is 47 feet 3 inches. I received a telegram from Xiangyang saying that the Xiang River water level rose sharply by 5.3 meters on the 5th and 6th. Chongqing rose by one zhang and zero, and there is still heavy rain in Yichang. The Jing River has exceeded the flood level of the 20th year of the Republic [1931] by six or seven inches. Fortunately, nothing has happened to the Jianghan main land. Various engineering offices are desperately rescuing. (2) I just received a telegram from the Jingjiang Embankment Engineering Bureau on the 6th, saying that the Jiang water at the Wan'an and two branch bureaus is seven or eight inches higher than in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], and the Shashi is four inches higher. The Gongma Haojin Shi five branch bureaus are six inches higher. All courtyard embankments have collapsed. Shashi is being rescued by military and political agencies, and there are more than forty dangerous points in the remaining branch bureaus. Based on this, Qin Fen, Fu Rulin, and engineering experts Burtley and Zheng Zhaojing departed from the capital at 9:00 AM on the 7th and went straight to Wuhu, transferring to Jiujiang Hankou and other places. Before the trip, he told reporters that the water situation along the river this time is extremely serious, and the future is worrying. The reason why it has not become a disaster is due to the solid construction of embankments and the arrangement of waterways in recent years. If the water rises again, it will be difficult to rescue in fact.

<h3>Chu Minyi Talks About President Wang’s Condition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chu Minyi arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 7th. After welcoming Kong Decheng at Bojiang, he spoke to reporters about President Wang’s condition. He said that Wang’s fever had not yet subsided.

The doctor ordered him to refuse to see guests and even stopped listening to people read newspapers from the morning of the 6th. If his fever does not increase during the day and returns to the normal 37 degrees Celsius, and the pain in his liver stops, then it can be determined that the gallbladder will not become an abscess, and he will be able to pass the danger period. According to Dr. Noel, he must rest for two or three weeks after being discharged from the hospital to avoid a recurrence. Chu then said that Vice President Kong was considerate of Wang’s illness and agreed to take full responsibility for the affairs of the Executive Yuan. He will come to Nanjing next Tuesday to preside over the Executive Yuan meeting and stay in Nanjing for two or three days each week. When Kong is not in Nanjing, he and Peng Xuepei will take turns going to Shanghai to ask for instructions on important matters. (Central News Agency telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Central Propaganda Department Cables Instructions to Pay Attention to Speech</h3>
<p>Ye Chucang Discusses the Handling of the "New Life Weekly" Case</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department, in order to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future after the improper wording was published in the "New Life Weekly" in Shanghai and has been dealt with separately, has re-cabled the party headquarters of various provinces and cities, instructing local publishing houses, newspapers, and news agencies to strictly prevent such records and comments in the future. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To the party headquarters of various provinces and cities: In May of this year, the "New Life Weekly" in Shanghai published disrespectful words about the Japanese imperial family, causing resentment. Since the Japanese polity is known to the world as being of an unbroken line for generations, its people's respect for the head of state and the imperial family is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Careless records and comments can easily hurt the feelings of the Japanese people. For a year, this department has repeatedly warned, and fortunately, it has been able to abide by it. Unexpectedly, the "New Life Weekly" had this unexpected record. In addition to having been dealt with in a separate case, and in order to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future, we are now issuing another earnest warning, ordering that local publishing circles and newspapers and news agencies be strictly instructed to prevent such records or comments in the future. Furthermore, regarding the crackdown on the anti-Japanese movement, the central government has repeatedly warned that the explicit order of the National Government on June 10 of this year should be followed, and all levels of party members should be informed and the people should be persuaded to strictly abide by it. This is of utmost importance." Printed by the Central Propaganda Department. (Central News Agency telegram on the 7th)</p>

He also said that since Chairman Chiang and President Wang successively delivered speeches and reports on February 1st and 20th, the proposition on Japan has been unanimously supported by the entire party. At that time, the central government also separately convened responsible personnel from the party headquarters of various provinces and cities to give them full explanation. The party headquarters of various provinces and cities also have a deep understanding. In the few locations where the language or behavior did not match the Party instruction, the local Party headquarters, acting in accordance with the central government's intentions, have been lost and corrected, etc. (Central News Agency telegram on the 7th)</p>

<h3>The Yangtze River Flood and Water Conservancy Construction</h3>
<p>— Ran</p>
<p>For the past ten days, newspapers have been reporting that the water level of the Yangtze River is rising sharply, and various ports along the river are gradually showing signs of danger. According to the latest news, the water level upstream and downstream of Hankou has exceeded the record of the flood of the past twenty years. Streets in counties and towns along the Yangtze River in Anhui and Jiangxi have mostly been flooded. The Jiangshui River in Xiaguan, Nanjing, is only a foot away from the embankment. Military and political leaders in various places have set out to inspect the embankments and supervise the responsible authorities to actively carry out flood prevention and rescue work. This Yangtze River flood has a significant impact on people's livelihood and national economy. It goes without saying.</p>
<p>Everyone with a little geographical knowledge knows that the Yangtze River has a long source and a smooth flow, and is rich in irrigation and shipping benefits. It is known as the lifeline of our country. It is not like the Yellow River, which has rapid flows and a lot of sand, and is often subject to floods, which has always been a major disaster for people's livelihood. Who would have thought that in recent years, the Yangtze River, which is known for its water conservancy, would also follow in the footsteps of the Yellow River and cause great suffering to our people? Is this a sign that heaven is not blessing our country, or is it due to poor planning?</p>
<p>Summer is usually rainy, and rivers are usually full, which is a normal phenomenon. If incessant rain and mountain torrents cause the river water to rise sharply and flood cities, it can still be blamed on natural disasters. However, in the past four or five years, we have been repeatedly threatened by major floods, only to see frantic responses in times of emergency and little attention paid to regular facilities in peacetime. This can be called a man-made disaster. The term "flood" is often used to describe the terrifying phenomenon of harming the people. How can we tolerate this man-made disaster that causes floods and not seek a fundamental solution?</p>
<p>The fundamental solution to the Yangtze River flood is water conservancy construction. Our China is based on agriculture. The development of agriculture is essential for the stability of the country. To achieve the development of agriculture, we should first pay attention to the convenience of irrigation. Moreover, standing in today's world, we must pay attention to industry and commerce. To revitalize industry and commerce, we should also develop shipping. Both convenient irrigation and the development of shipping rely on water conservancy construction. Therefore, water conservancy construction is also a fundamental task that should be given urgent attention in our country's economic construction. If we can work together with one heart and strive for the perfection of the Yangtze River water conservancy construction, not only can the great disaster of floods that cause great suffering to our people be reduced, but the future of economic construction will also depend on it.</p>
<p>The operation of the Yangtze River water conservancy construction is presided over by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission established by the government. However, due to the many troubles and lack of funding in the country, it has been unable to exert its functions. Today, when floods are about to form, the Economic Commission has only allocated 100,000 yuan to supply the needs of flood prevention work. The actual effect of the projects implemented with this meager amount can be predicted. In addition to temporary emergency relief, there is still no plan for active and lasting facilities.</p>
<p>However, if something is generally recognized as essential, it is easy to achieve with collective effort. For example, with the advocacy of powerful people, the construction of highways has made considerable achievements today. The importance of water conservancy construction, which is related to the economic lifeline, is no less than that of highways. It is hoped that the whole country will rise up and catch up in order to accomplish this century-old plan.</p>
<h3>The Italy-Ethiopia Dispute: The United States Refuses to Intervene, Which is Tantamount to Announcing the Death Penalty for the Pact of Paris; Advises Overseas Chinese to Leave Ethiopian Territory as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the United States' refusal to intervene in the Italy-Ethiopia dispute, it is generally believed that the US government has two motives for this attitude: (1) unwilling to get caught in the vortex; (2) hoping that all countries will eventually respect existing treaties. The State Department has recently authorized George, the Chargé d'affaires in Ethiopia, to notify approximately 125 American overseas Chinese, including 110 missionaries, to leave Ethiopia immediately or take necessary measures to protect their own safety. The State Department refused to explain this evacuation order, saying only that it had been considering the matter for two weeks. (Havas telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Some observers here believe that Secretary of State Hull's response to Ethiopia's request to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact has declared the treaty dead. Moreover, the current Italy-Ethiopia incident has been the third time that the treaty has failed to resolve international disputes. Officials privately stated that the Kellogg-Briand Pact's effectiveness in the Italy-Ethiopia dispute has been completely hopeless because the treaty has no provisions for punishing violators. Government officials also said that they do not know whether the government has indeed notified American overseas Chinese to leave Ethiopia, but said that this procedure has been prepared and will be implemented by the American Chargé d'affaires in Ethiopia as the opportunity arises. The State Department stated that there are currently 125 American residents living in Ethiopia, including 113 missionaries, and the rest are diplomats and businessmen. The US government will not issue orders regarding their departure, but will issue advice, but the result will probably be the same. According to news here, American overseas Chinese should leave Ethiopia as soon as possible, as the railway to the coast may soon fall into Italian hands. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to news from the Ethiopian capital, the American Consulate there denied ordering American overseas Chinese to leave the Ethiopian capital, but also admitted that it had discussed the issue of withdrawal with leading American overseas Chinese. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times commented on the Italy-Ethiopia dispute, saying, "The current situation in Ethiopia is extremely bad, which is not a blessing for white civilization. The Pact of Paris was already on its deathbed when Japan occupied Northeast China. Now, it has reached its end." The newspaper then criticized the US government's response to the Ethiopian emperor, saying, "On the one hand, the United States expressed its belief to Ethiopia that Italy would not invade the country, while on the other hand, it ordered American overseas Chinese to leave Ethiopia. These two things happening at the same time are truly unbelievable." (Havas telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Arms Export Ban: Not Applicable to Italy and Ethiopia</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia, diplomatic circles believe that when the countries concerned go to war in the future, they will not purchase ammunition from American factories. However, if the US government encounters such a situation, it will actually be unable to prevent it. It should ask Congress to pass a bill authorizing the government to ban the export of ammunition. (Note: The US ban on arms exports to the warring countries of the Chaco, namely Bolivia and Paraguay, was specially permitted by the Senate within a designated scope, and is not suitable for implementation in Italy and Ethiopia.) (Havas telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said during a routine press conference today that there are no new developments in the current situation in Ethiopia, but the State Department is still closely monitoring it. At the same time, observers here are speculating that the United Kingdom may initiate a proposal to ban arms exports because Hull has indicated that he has asked experts to collect information on the US policy on exporting arms to warring countries. However, at present, this kind of ban may only be used as an indication, because neither Italy nor Ethiopia has purchased any ammunition from the United States. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Ethiopia Asks the United States to Intervene: Suspected to be at the Instigation of the British</h3>
<p>(Rome) Senator Dafongchaiti recently commented on the Ethiopian issue in the Tribune, saying, "The request for the United States to come forward and intervene is definitely not something that the Ethiopian government can do. It must be the invention of the British Foreign Office or Colonial Office. Looking at the fact that the British government simultaneously asked the US government whether collective action should be taken to prevent Italy from violating the Pact of Paris, one can suddenly realize. As for the US government's response to Ethiopia's note, it is reasonable not to issue it in a solemn form. The serious reason for rejecting the invocation of the Pact of Paris is that after events have already occurred in the world, and even while events are occurring, if one tries to test the effectiveness of this treaty, it is already foolish and hypocritical to treat Ethiopia as a perfect model of national civilization."

<p>(London) A fascist Italian newspaper reporter, Italian Captain Falaile, announced today that he is willing to duel with British Labour Party Deputy Leader in the House of Commons, Major Attlee. This is a reaction to the recent debate in the British House of Commons on the Italy-Ethiopia dispute. Mr. Fale said that he is willing to fight Mr. Attlee in a neutral country with any weapon to determine the winner, because he objects to certain reservations made by Mr. Attlee during the debate. Mr. Attlee has declined, saying that dueling is a barbaric and evil habit for resolving disputes, and he disdains to do so. However, Mr. Fale is still dissatisfied and is determined to do so. When Mr. Attlee met with a Reuters interviewer to discuss this matter, he said that there is no freedom of speech in Italy today, so Mr. Fale does not know what is permissible during a debate in the British Parliament. According to reports, Mr. Attlee is 52 years old, participated in the European War, and retired from the army as a major in 1919. He served as Undersecretary of War in 1924.

<h3>The United Kingdom Carefully Considers Seeking Cooperation with the Great Powers; British Newspapers Comment on Government Policy, Saying That One Mistake Cannot Be Repeated</h3>
<p>(Paris) Le Petit Parisien commented on the US reply to Ethiopia, saying, "The United Kingdom is currently seeking cooperation with France and other powers on the Ethiopian issue. In France, which is friendly to Italy, it is wise to be cautious. The same is true in the United States, for fear that an international discussion of this issue will not only fail to localize the Italy-Ethiopia conflict, but may even expand it. This mentality of the US government is very obvious." (Havas telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Observer commented on the Italy-Ethiopia issue, saying, "Assessments of the diplomatic policy used by Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden towards France and Italy have mostly expressed dissatisfaction. One mistake cannot be repeated. As for the current situation of the League of Nations, its weakness and incompetence are undeniable. How is it possible for us to mobilize it to impose sanctions on Italy? If we advocate this, it will be enough to destroy the League of Nations and isolate ourselves. As for France, it does not want to see the Ethiopian incident create complications, and will naturally agree with us, but we must take into account its friendship with Italy. Now, if we do not intervene, it is fine. If we want to intervene, it must be through a war. If it is a war, we must either ally with Italy or assist Ethiopia. However, under the current circumstances, it is not appropriate to intervene. We should carefully wait for the opportunity to avoid harming our country's relations with Italy." The Sunday Times holds a similar view, saying, "The situation is so serious that the cabinet is now doing its best to find a solution. All our citizens should support the government regardless of party affiliation. Earlier, Eden's visit to Rome and his proposed solution failed, but the government did not ignore the Italy-Ethiopia dispute from the beginning, and to allow it to remain in its current state without any improvement is not its intention."

<h3>Germany's Shipbuilding Program Will Notify Washington Treaty Signatories; Unrelated to the Anglo-German Agreement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to well-informed sources, Germany will notify the signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty of the number and tonnage of warships currently under construction and to be started this year. This notification is unrelated to Germany's naval shipbuilding program after the conclusion of the London Naval Agreement. The London Naval Agreement allows Germany to build warships accounting for 35% of the British fleet. This ratio will only be completed in a few years, and it stipulates the proportion of construction to be carried out each year. The detailed shipbuilding program is still under negotiation between the United Kingdom and Germany. (Havas telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Minister's Trip to Berlin: Results Are Not Great; Germany Fails to Clearly Recognize Poland's Current Western Border</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Times commented on the Berlin talks, saying that after Germany and Poland concluded a ten-year non-aggression treaty, Polish Foreign Minister Beck's trip to Berlin did not achieve anything. It also said, "Powerful circles in Warsaw originally hoped that Beck's trip would enable Germany to clearly recognize Poland's current western border, or at least that German leader Hitler would issue a declaration on the non-aggression treaty signed on January 26 last year, willing to extend it indefinitely. Who would have thought that the result obtained by Beck was only a statement of maintaining good-neighborly relations, which under the current circumstances seems insufficient to satisfy the hopes of the Polish people." (Havas telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The semi-official Polish Postal News commented on Foreign Minister Beck's trip to Berlin, saying, "The willingness of Germany and Poland to maintain peace is expressed through concrete actions towards Eastern Europe, and not through empty talk. The Foreign Minister's trip to Berlin had no other goals." It also said, "The desire to stabilize bilateral relations in the long term has been fully demonstrated, which is much better than diplomatic documents with temporal limitations. In addition to the ceremonial treatment received during the Foreign Minister's visit to Germany, the talks were conducted in a good atmosphere, because the importance of a friendly atmosphere is equal to the goals of the talks."

<h3>The Little Entente Opposes Austria's Restoration Attempt; All Actions Follow France's Lead</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to news from the recent political meeting of the Little Entente, it was decided that any restoration attempt in Austria should be a warning sign of danger, and that all countries should rise up and help each other. At the same time, the Little Entente has notified the French authorities of this decision. The newspaper continued to say that French politicians must pay attention to this clear attitude of the Little Entente. The most important thing is not to forget that France is an ally of the Little Entente. In the future, all actions should be careful not to turn old friends into new enemies. (National News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Austrian government has recently changed the legal status of the Habsburg royal family. The Qing Yi Bao published a commentary here, saying that the countries of the Little Entente have already been uneasy about it. It said, "Austria must survive, which is necessary from a European perspective. However, the restoration will cause great turmoil in the Danube River basin, and will threaten Austria's survival. It is generally believed that the restoration can prevent the merger of Germany and Austria, but this is not the case. Under the current situation in Europe, everything that causes extremely dangerous changes must be avoided." (Havas telegram on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Greek Deputy Prime Minister Visits Rome; This Trip is Related to the Restoration Issue; The Referendum is Postponed to November</h3>
<p>Athens: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Army General Kondylis left for Rome in the afternoon and will stay there for three days. Before his departure, he told the press that this trip was at the invitation of the Italian war veterans and was not of an official nature. It is generally believed that this trip is related to the restoration issue. (Havas telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>Athens: Prime Minister Tsaldaris recently told the press that his personal views on the issue of the form of government will be announced at an appropriate time. The referendum was originally scheduled for September 15, but the government decided to postpone it to November 15 in order to discuss the voting procedures with the opposition party. He also said, "If the opposition party is willing to cooperate sincerely with the government so that the issue of the form of government can be resolved definitively, I dare say that national affairs will be able to follow a normal course of evolution. The issue of the form of government should be based on the will of the people, and should not be privately owned by any party. This is something that everyone should know." (Havas telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>Athens: When the National Assembly discussed the referendum bill today, Agriculture Minister Diadoxos delivered a speech advocating restoration. All the deputies enthusiastically applauded and agreed. The Assembly then adjourned and is scheduled to reconvene on Sunday. (Havas telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Former King and Queen of Greece Divorce; Approved by the Romanian Court of Appeals</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: The Court of Appeals today ruled to allow the divorce of the former King and Queen of Greece. A secret hearing was held before the ruling, and the accusations were not made public. The Supreme Court will probably approve this ruling within two weeks. Since the Greek people are about to vote on the issue of the political system, this divorce is of great significance. (National News Agency telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Announcement by Authorities in Outer Mongolia: Details of the Manchuria Conference. Relying on the Japanese Army as Support, They Make Excessive Demands. Border Crossing Incidents Occur Repeatedly, Revealing Aggression</h3>
<p>Manchuria, Manchukuo-Mongolia held their 12th conference on the 6th in the afternoon to discuss border demarcation issues. The Outer Mongolian side, based on its own and Soviet-made maps, consistently claimed that the area near Halaha Temple belonged to Outer Mongolian territory and refused to concede. The "Manchukuo" side strongly refuted this, stating that it was inappropriate to demarcate such a significant border based on incomplete maps. The debate lasted for about two hours, and the meeting adjourned at 4 p.m. The next meeting is scheduled for September. (7th dispatch from Tōngdiàn)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Acting Chairman Zhuobo'ersang of the Outer Mongolian government made the following statement to the press in Kulun:</p>
<p>Recounting the Events: In January of this year, our newspapers reported that Japanese and "Manchukuo" troops invaded our territory, seized the Halaha Temple area, and opened fire on our border guards, killing one of our military officers and one soldier. In order to avoid bloodshed, our border military authorities did not take military action but initiated negotiations with the Manchukuo side to seek a peaceful resolution to this conflict.</p>
<p>Beginning of Negotiations: On June 3rd, the Manchukuo-Mongolian delegations began negotiations at Manchuria Station. Within a few days of the start of the meeting, our side already suspected whether the puppet government had the sincerity to resolve this matter peacefully. Our delegation, led by Chairman Sangbu, tried every means to reach an agreement to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The Manchukuo delegation, on the other hand, did not approach the investigation of the incident's background with a spirit of seeking truth from facts.</p>
<p>Insincerity of the Puppet Government: After three weeks of meetings, they were unwilling to consider this issue, focusing instead on other matters. However, our delegation had no authority to discuss these matters. Furthermore, these issues were never mentioned by either government when convening this meeting. It is very obvious that the Manchukuo representatives were attempting to delay the negotiations. Moreover, in the past few days, several facts have proven that the Manchukuo side, with the constant support of the Japanese troops stationed in Manchukuo, is unwilling to resolve the conflict at Halaha Temple by peaceful means, but instead is engaging in further encroachment on our country's territory, thereby increasing tension in relations.</p>
<p>Another Border Crossing: On June 23rd, the director of the Songbu'er police station, located 70 kilometers southeast of the Mongolian Lieba fishing ground on the Halaha River, and two soldiers were patrolling the border on horseback when they were shot at by two cavalrymen. The latter were captured by the patrol sent out from the police station. It was discovered that one of them was a Japanese military surveyor and the other was a Russian, both serving in the Japanese army. Because we always want to maintain friendly relations with our neighboring countries and resolve all minor border misunderstandings peacefully, without involving major political disputes, the two officers of the Japanese army, although they had clearly crossed the border illegally, were released by our border authorities after inspection and returned to the Manchukuo border garrison.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that when we handed over the two captured personnel to the Manchukuo side on June 26th, the Manchukuo border garrison refused to accept them. On June 28th, after our side's strenuous efforts, our garrison sent the two men and all their belongings to the Manchukuo garrison. The captured personnel subsequently declared in writing that they had indeed been arrested in Mongolian territory and expressed their gratitude for the courteous treatment.</p>
<p>Seeking Peace: We only protested to the other side for entering our borders. On June 26th, our border guards in the Bulundixi area were shot at twice by the Manchukuo side. However, we still ordered our guards not to be provoked, so our guards did not retaliate. The fact that two Japanese military officers were indeed arrested in Mongolian territory and we handed over the personnel and their belongings to the puppet government shows that we sincerely wish to resolve all border disputes peacefully. At the same time, this matter seems to have been resolved enough, because we have the right to demand that the puppet state severely punish those who damage friendly neighborly relations and violate our borders.</p>
<p>Counter-Protest: "The Manchukuo side clearly does not want to maintain friendly neighborly relations. This can be proven by several facts. On June 26th, the Mongolian side refused to take back the two captured military officers we handed over. On June 27th, Yu Ji (transliteration), the director of the Political Affairs Department of the Manchukuo Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived at Manchuria Station to meet with our Chairman's representative, Sangbu, requesting that the captured personnel be returned immediately and apologizing to the puppet government. At the same time, the border crossers must be reported. On July 4th, Kang visited Sangbu again and presented an official letter entrusted to him for delivery, containing a protest against the arrest of the aforementioned personnel and making the following demands:</p>
<p>First, Outer Mongolia must bear full responsibility for this incident. Second, Outer Mongolia must strictly investigate the border crossers. The puppet government requests the right to send representatives to be stationed in Mongolia on a long-term basis. At the same time, these representatives must maintain regular contact with the puppet government and have freedom of movement in Mongolian territory. If Mongolia does not accept these demands, the puppet state will demand that all Mongolian troops east of the Tangmusuke Temple withdraw to Tangdi.</p>
<p>Unreasonable Demands: On the same day, the head of the Japanese military delegation stationed in Manchuria visited Sangbu, representing the headquarters of the Kwantung Army, to confirm and expand on these same demands, with particular emphasis on the demand that the Kwantung Army have the right to send representatives into Mongolia to establish telegraph lines in Mongolian territory for communication and transportation.</p>
<p>This statement is particularly perplexing because it did not come from the Japanese government, nor from the puppet government, but from the Kwantung Army stationed in South Manchuria, and its target of negotiation was Outer Mongolia, with whom they have no relationship, past or present. Outer Mongolia has already expressed a particularly peaceful attitude towards the resolution of the issue of the two officers serving in the Japanese army being arrested in our territory. However, this matter has been turned into an excuse for unreasonable demands by the Manchukuo authorities, so as to obstruct the mutual relations between Outer Mongolia and the puppet government. Outer Mongolia is extremely surprised by the illegal and incomprehensible actions of the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities, because they trample on the most basic principles of justice and the peaceful coexistence of all nations."

<h3>Russia Establishes New Fishing Zones; Japan Prepares to Lodge a Protest</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union on fisheries have made no progress, and Japan's attempts to send personnel to inspect fisheries in the North Pacific have been rejected. This is the latest act of tyranny by the Soviet Union. Japan finds it difficult to deal with this issue. This time, they have once again set up fishing zones without authorization, daring to violate the treaty. Therefore, Japan is extremely indignant about this. According to recent information, the Soviet Union has newly established three state-owned fishing zones in the Kalagensky area on the eastern coast of Kamchatka. However, according to the treaty, this matter must be decided by the two countries through consultation. In February of this year, the Soviet Union notified that it intended to establish 19 fishing zones. At that time, because these fishing zones were leased by the Japanese side or were in the process of being leased, they were not recognized. This time, the three fishing zones established by their state-owned fisheries are all included within the 19 zones, which is a clear violation of the treaty by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry believes that this repeated disregard for the treaty threatens Japan's interests in the North Pacific and causes anxiety for businesses, and is extremely indignant. It immediately consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct officials stationed abroad to investigate the facts and decided to strongly demand that the Soviet Union reflect on its actions and change its behavior. The method of revising the treaty and resolving this issue in the future should be approached with an extremely tough attitude. This is necessary and essential.

<h3>Japanese Air Defense Drill Resembles Real Warfare</h3>
<p>Mock Enemy Aircraft Night Raid on Tokyo; Defending Forces Retaliate and Repel Them; Nine People Injured</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The air defense drill continued until the night of the 6th, when heavy rain suddenly fell, but both attacking and defending sides continued to rush forward and fight all night. From around 3:00 a.m. on the 7th, a simulated combat began, and around 5:00 a.m., 30 enemy aircraft launched a final all-out air raid.

Finally, at 7:19 a.m., after leaving behind countless valuable records, the drill was completed. However, this drill resembled actual combat. In the darkness under the air raid, seven members of the defense team and two police officers were knocked down by cars and other things, suffering minor and serious injuries, which shows the seriousness of this operation. (7th dispatch from the Japan Alliance)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army's Huge Military Expenditure; Reaches 900 Million Yen Within Three Years</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the large amount of the Japanese army's budget that has been rapidly increasing since 1932, and which areas are benefiting from the money used for the military industry, an investigation was conducted previously, and the following conclusions have now been reached:</p>
<p>In the three years from 1932 to 1934, the amount used for the military industry reached approximately 900 million yen, of which 80% was given to private companies and the remaining 20% was given to state-owned enterprises. The recipients of these 900 million yen included 60 large companies with capital of over one million yen and approximately 2,000 military equipment companies with capital of less than one million yen. If companies involved in military uniforms, provisions, and other related industries are added, the number reaches over 3,000. As for the types of industries, there are large-scale industries such as aircraft, armored vehicles, and tanks, as well as industries that manufacture rubber goods. The number of people engaged in these industries is said to be approximately 3 million. (7th dispatch from Dentsu)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's National Road Construction Plan; Budgeted at 30 Million Yen; Relief for Mountain Villages, Convenience for Military Movement</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has always neglected relief plans for mountain villages compared to farming villages. This time, it has decided on the following economic revitalization plan for mountain villages: (1) The decline of mountain villages is mostly due to inconvenient transportation and heavy freight costs. Therefore, it has been decided to build a road network to mountain villages. (2) A budget of 30 million yen has been allocated in the next year's budget. Moreover, after the implementation of the plan, the transportation roads in various places will be completed, which will facilitate military movement. Therefore, it has received strong support from the military. (7th dispatch from the China Allied Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs Will Convene a Conference of Colonial Governors; Discuss Countermeasures for Emergency Situations; Ugaki May Arrive in Tokyo Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Colonial Affairs plans to take advantage of Governor-General Ugaki of Korea's trip to Tokyo to convene a conference of colonial governors.

(7th dispatch from the China Allied Press)</p>
<p>Busan Governor-General Ugaki, who was on his way east, arrived in Busan last night and stayed at the Haeundae Hot Spring Hotel. He will depart today on a connecting ship. When the Governor-General departed, he told reporters, "This trip east is only to serve the Heavenly Emperor and to discuss the next year's budget. There are no other tasks. Every time I travel to the mainland, there are rumors about how the next regime will change. I can only listen to them. The Okada Cabinet has been formed for almost a year, and I am very calm about political affairs. I also agree with the Finance Minister's policy on public bonds. However, the Korean budget cannot be established without public bonds, so I am afraid that it will not be possible to completely avoid issuing public bonds." (7th dispatch from Dentsu)</p>

<h3>Movement to Raise Silver Prices: American Silver State Senators Continue Efforts; Jointly Request the President to Continue Silver Purchases</h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Senator Thomas announced today that 40 Democratic and Republican senators have signed a petition to be presented to President Roosevelt, requesting that he continue the silver purchase program in order to raise silver prices. This petition was initiated by senators from silver-producing states. He hopes to obtain the signatures of 49 senators or a majority of the Senate before submitting it. Thomas told reporters that President Roosevelt now has full authority to raise silver prices, but we feel that the silver purchase program has not been fully implemented. Silver is now a major issue nationwide. Thomas then commented on the recent drop in silver prices, saying that banks know when the Treasury Department will sell or buy silver, so they can take the opportunity to profit when silver prices rise and fall sharply. Thomas explicitly stated that he was not blaming Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau or the banks for being two-faced, because when the opportunity to profit comes, a bank will always be a bank. Thomas also said that if the United States accelerates silver purchases, silver could reach a price of $1.19 per ounce before the U.S. government purchases the set limit of 300 million yuan. The U.S. government now has the power to control silver prices and can also have a say in determining gold prices. Therefore, it should participate in international conferences to seek stability in the gold-silver prices of a bimetallic monetary system. (6th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Third Political Party Appears in the United States; Named "American Political Alliance"; Platform Contains Left-Leaning Elements; Eliminating Overproduction as a Slogan</h3>
<p>Chicago A third major political party has appeared in the United States today. Its platform is generally left-leaning. For several days, liberals and radicals from all over the country have gathered here, and today they have formed a new party, tentatively named the "American Political Alliance." The party has resolved to implement an economic system of "production for use" to oppose the profit system. The "production for use" plan is directly derived from the ideas of socialist writer Sinclair, which is the doctrine that Sinclair promoted when he failed to win the California governorship last November. Before the party was established today, Progressive Republican Senator Norris also gave a speech, saying, "What I favor is organizing a second party to oppose the combined conservatives in the current Republican and Democratic parties. If you can establish a solid foundation, the progressives in the Senate will definitely support you." However, Norris believes that if the name of a third party is used, it will be difficult to win for the time being. (6th dispatch from the National News Agency)</p>
<h3>International Exposition to Be Held in Paris in 1937; Designing a Steel-Reinforced Concrete Tower; Will Shine with the Eiffel Tower</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris International Exposition of 1937 is now being actively prepared. The preparatory committee is currently discussing a plan proposed by an architectural engineer in Paris, advocating the construction of a colossal steel-reinforced concrete tower in the exposition venue, with a height of 38 floors, a total of 160 meters, a semi-circular truncated cone shape, a circumference of 35 meters at the base, and a circumference of 25 meters at the top. The construction method of the tower has been specially studied to defend against aerial bombing. The basement is built on the bottom floor, which can accommodate more than 4,000 people. If this level is completed, it will be able to shine with the famous Eiffel Tower, competing for supremacy. The Eiffel Tower was built for the Paris International Exposition of 1900 to represent the miracle of the iron and steel industry at that time, while the new tower to be built for the 1937 Exposition will be used to show the progress of modern steel-reinforced concrete architecture. The construction site of the new tower is located between the Bercy and Champ de Mars districts of Paris. In the future, the towering tower there, with its futuristic artistic style, can be found here. In addition, the exposition needs to build two modern art museums, one for the French National Museum of Art and one for the Paris Museum of Art. The groundbreaking ceremony was recently held. The two museums are located next to the Seine River, on the site of the famous carpet factory in the 17th century. The doors and windows all face east, the location is spacious, and the light is sufficient, for displaying modern paintings, sculptures, and other items. Its rich magic is unmatched.

<h3>Kailuan: Majia Mine Strike</h3>

Police from the mine area were dispatched for guard duty from the afternoon of the 6th. Fortunately, the workers did not take any unexpected actions. The mine's labor-management liaison office is currently in mediation with the foremen. The strike wave at the Majiagou Mine was caused by the miners' opposition to extending the night shift without increasing wages and canceling holidays on various commemorative days. However, after the strike, no representatives were put forward to meet with the mine's responsible personnel. The mine stated that the night shift was normally eight hours, but it was actually only six hours. Due to strict supervision and the implementation of Article 7 of the revised Factory Law of the Construction Department, the holiday for the July 9th Incident anniversary was canceled, leading to a small number of workers inciting a strike.

<h3>Anqing: Guangcheng Embankment Collapses; Total Losses in the Embankment Area Estimated at 400,000 to 500,000 Yuan; Embankments Along the River are Also in Extreme Danger</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, Anhui Province has been dry for a long time without rain, and many people feared that last year's drought would be repeated. The provincial government once promulgated emergency drought relief measures, ordering the counties to follow them. Since the middle of last month, there has been continuous heavy rain, and mountain floods have erupted. In Anhui, the rivers and lakes have gradually increased. Taking Anqing as an example, the water level of the Yangtze River has continued to increase. As of noon on the 4th, the water level was 12 meters, 2 decimeters, and 6 centimeters, which is 1 decimeter higher than the highest water level in 1933 and 9 decimeters and 3 centimeters lower than the highest water level in 1931. The roads along the river from Xiaodongmen to the west to the Zhaoshang Wharf outside Dananmen are all covered with several inches of water, blocking traffic. The areas around Daxinqiao Hengbatou outside Ximen are also knee-deep in water. Most of the shops in these areas have moved to avoid the water. Those who have nowhere to move are sleeping in the overflowing water, looking extremely miserable. The area near Sankongqiao outside Dongmen is also flooded, and residents are mostly uneasy. All the embankments along the Yangtze River in Anhui are now in a precarious situation with the turbulent river waves. Although the Construction Department has set up a flood prevention committee and drafted emergency flood prevention construction measures, which were passed by the Standing Committee of the Provincial Government and notified to the counties, a large number of personnel have been dispatched to assist the counties in handling flood prevention matters in the most dangerous and important areas, such as the Ma Hua Tongren Embankment, the Dongliu Guangfeng Embankment, the Huaining Guangcheng Embankment, the Guangji Embankment (the Heng and Zhen sections), the Tongcheng Dacheng Embankment, the Wuhuai Huangsitan, the Fanchang Pangxieji, and the Tongling Guanzhuang Embankment. However, the Baoju Embankment and the Bao Yingzhou Embankment in Shipai Town, Huaining County, and the Yufeng Embankment in Dongliu County were all washed away by the water because they could not be rescued in time. Furthermore, the Guangcheng Embankment in Haikouzhou, Huaining County, which is about 60 li in circumference, has about 30,000 mu of farmland, and about 9,000,000 people, is located at a key point of the Wan River. It has been repeatedly eroded by the river water. On the morning of the 4th, at 6 a.m., the embankment collapsed due to a breach in the sand ridge in Yejiadun, resulting in a flood. It is reported that the total loss in the entire embankment area is about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The Guangji Embankment in the eastern part of Anqing City has a considerable history in the water conservancy of Anhui Province. Starting from the eastern end of Linjiang Road in Anqing and ending at the Congyang Town in Tongcheng, it extends for hundreds of li and is divided into Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen sections. It was built in the mid-Qing Dynasty and is of great concern to the interests of Huaining and Tongcheng counties. It collapsed in 1931, causing a disaster, and its vitality has not yet been restored. Recently, the river water has risen daily, and the situation has become increasingly urgent. The embankment bodies in Weijiazui and Mianchang have been immersed in the river water, and the areas excavated last year due to drought are in danger. The Construction Department ordered Sun Peifang, the county magistrate of Huaining, to personally supervise the embankment protection team and actively prevent and control the flood. Currently, rescue efforts are underway, but the area has not yet been pulled out of danger. The provincial party and government authorities believe that although engineering defenses have been made for this flood, the actual situation should be inspected in various places to gain a clear understanding. Therefore, the Provincial Party Affairs Special Commissioner's Office, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Disaster Relief Committee formed an inspection team, which was led by various officials on special boats to inspect the banks of the Huai River in order to improve flood prevention efforts. It is expected that if there are no heavy rains and storm surges, the flood disaster can be reduced. Otherwise, a major flood disaster will cause unimaginable harm. (July 5)</p>
<h3>Three Floods in Eastern Jiangxi: Both Banks of the Xin River are Flooded; Roadbeds of Highways and Railways are Washed Away</h3>
<p>Guixi Correspondence: The counties along the Xin River in eastern Jiangxi, including Yushan, Shangrao, Yiyang, Guixi, Yujiang, and Yugan, experienced a major flood on June 21. The losses in various counties were very heavy. After two days of sunny weather, the water level receded slightly. Unexpectedly, on the 24th and 25th, there was another torrential rain, which did not stop day and night, causing mountain floods and the Xin River to overflow, which was even worse than the previous time. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Highway was flooded, and the entire road was impassable on the 25th and 26th. For thousands of miles along both banks of the river, except for the high mountains still sticking out of the water, the rest was a vast expanse of water. Houses and fields were submerged in water, and people and livestock fled to the mountains, exposed to wind and rain, suffering from cold and hunger, which was extremely miserable. This year, the crops in various counties in eastern Jiangxi were very lush, already more than two feet high, and a good harvest was expected in July. After this blow, it is feared that it will become a pie in the sky. On the 26th, the water in Guixi was high enough to wash feet while sitting on the city wall, and boats could travel on the streets. Materials from the Guixi Railway Bridge Project Office of the Yunan Railway outside the West City were washed away by the rolling waves, resulting in huge losses. Various machines were also submerged. Victims from the surrounding villages flocked to the city, wailing in groups, which was even more heartbreaking. On the night of the 26th and all day on the 27th, there was still heavy rain, and the Jiao River burst, with the water level more than ten feet high. Houses and fields in various counties along both banks of the Xin River were turned into swamps. The roadbeds of the newly built Yunan Railway section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Highway were mostly washed away. Telegraph and telephone communications in various counties were cut off. Streets and markets were also flooded. Countless houses, furniture, livestock, and animals were washed away, and people drowned one after another. The mountainsides in various counties were full of refugees wailing, exposed to heavy rain, strong winds, hunger, and cold, truly a living hell on earth. On the night of the 27th, the southwest city wall facing the water in Guixi almost completely collapsed, and the rushing water poured directly in. In an instant, the water depth in the entire city was six to seven feet. The collapsing walls and houses boomed incessantly. Ruan Zhaochang, commander of the 57th Division, urgently sent people to swim and open the Fuxing Gate so that the water could flow north through the city; otherwise, the entire city would have been destroyed. The houses of the Railway Bridge Project Office of the Yunan Railway outside the West City were all washed away at this time, and all the materials were washed away. The company urgently hired small boats to salvage materials. It is reported that the losses were about 100,000 yuan. On the 29th, the water level in various counties gradually receded. Although telegraph communication was restored, there were too many sections of the roadbed of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Highway that had been washed away, and they were being repaired. On the 30th, traffic had not yet resumed. The counties in eastern Jiangxi have suffered from bandit disasters for years, followed by a drought last year and three floods this year. The rural areas have collapsed, and the commerce has gone bankrupt. The county magistrates of various counties have sent telegrams to the province and the central government, requesting emergency relief. According to the local elders, this flood is the worst since the fourth year of the Guangxu era. (June 30)</p>

<h3>Wuxi: Caoqiao Murder Case is Under Appeal; Defamation Lawsuit Against Three Newspapers Causes Repercussions</h3>
<p>In November of last year, a headless murder case occurred in Caoqiao Town, which belongs to Wujin County. It caused a sensation in the counties of Wuxi. The National Daobao and other newspapers in the county reported on it one after another. The prosecutor of the Wujin County Court also filed charges according to law and summoned several defendants, including Zhou Songsheng, to investigate and prosecute them. Subsequently, the Criminal Court concluded the trial, and all the defendants were declared innocent. However, the prosecutor expressed dissatisfaction, and the appeal is still in the High Court. Unexpectedly, Sun Darong and others, who are involved in the case, suddenly filed a lawsuit in the local court of the county against the National Daobao, Ren Bao, and Xinmin Bao newspapers of the county, accusing them of defamation, because the defendants in the case had been declared innocent. This has caused repercussions from the entire press in the county. At 3 p.m. on the 7th, the Wuxi Journalists Association specially convened an emergency meeting to discuss the matter. The agenda items were: 1. Newspaper offices have been repeatedly sued for business-related behavior, which affects the spirit of the journalism profession.

The meeting adjourned after discussion.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Zhejiang University Student Commits Suicide in Hotel</h3>

Because the school had already started summer vacation, at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 6th, he took four pieces of bedding and luggage to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Hotel at the city station and opened room number 23. He then went out, returned to the hotel in the evening for dinner, and went to bed at around 10 p.m., and informed the waiter that he would take the early express train back to Jiaxing at 8 a.m. on the 7th. Unexpectedly, at 7 a.m. on the 7th, the waiter called him but there was no response. He broke down the door and saw Fan's mouth bleeding and he had died. There were two bottles of Lysol on the table, indicating that he had committed suicide by taking poison. The police station was immediately notified and the court was notified. Prosecutor Zhu Nianci led officials to inspect the scene. At the same time, the Agricultural College was notified, and his family in Puyuan was telegraphed to Hangzhou to handle the aftermath. It is said that the reason for Fan's suicide was related to economic problems. A letter from a Shen to Fan was found in his pocket, containing words such as "failure to borrow money." He only had a few small foreign silver coins and long dollars with him.</p>

Chairman Chiang has strived for the revolution and worked hard for the nation for more than 20 years, and his contributions to the party and the country are unparalleled. For the sake of respecting virtue and rewarding merit, and for the sake of encouraging the present and inspiring the future, we express our utmost admiration and respect for the revolutionary leader who has benefited the party and the country, and we think of ways to commemorate him. Therefore, we have united more than 100 public organizations and comrades from all circles in this city, and with the most sincere attitude, we have initiated the establishment of the memorial hall, hoping that Shanghai, the largest metropolis in East Asia, will build a valuable memorial for the hardworking Chairman Chiang, on the one hand to encourage Chairman Chiang to follow the legacy of the Premier, continue to work hard, and use the spirit of revolution to break the current adverse environment and seek a new path for the Chinese nation, and on the other hand to call on the majority of our people to show a clear expression of trust and support for the revolutionary leader and to be their backing. The above is the greatest significance of the various circles in this city, from the standpoint of the people, to initiate the establishment of the Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall. Today's mission is of great importance and significance, in organizing the preparatory committee, to be the responsible design, supervision and guidance agency for future progress, hoping that all those present will carefully select personnel, elect people with reputation and enthusiasm for society, to serve as committee members and share the responsibility, to establish a sound and orderly organization, in order to shoulder this important mission. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is difficult to achieve development without collective wisdom and efforts.

We also hope that all circles will unanimously support and provide convenience, so that colleagues can complete this undertaking in the shortest possible time under the leadership and supervision of party and government agencies and all circles.

<h3>Methods for Saving Industry and Commerce: Three Movements Should Be Earnestly Implemented - Opinions Expressed by Liang Shangdong, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry</h3>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that the Ministry of Industry previously published opinions on methods for revitalizing Chinese commerce, stating that the fundamental ways to prevent the dumping of foreign goods and reduce the trade deficit are the three movements of controlled trade, promotion of domestic goods, and national frugality. Liang Shangdong, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry, specifically expressed the following opinions on these three points:</p>
<p>Controlled Trade</p>
<p>Scholars hold quite different opinions on whether controlled trade can be implemented in our country. Our country's economic organization is unsound, and its diplomatic position is difficult, making implementation of control relatively difficult. However, since the national economy has declined to this point, we should not shy away from difficulties. As long as we come up with a complete plan and firm determination, the difficulties can be overcome. The steps can be divided into three: (1) Revise tariff regulations, and increase import tariffs separately. Although there may be resistance in diplomatic terms, it should not be difficult to resolve by defending ourselves based on legal facts. (2) Export controls and sound organization of industry and commerce. The state manages the quantity, price, and quality of products based on market supply and demand conditions, seeking to meet the conditions of foreign markets. In order to seek common cooperation, financial mutual assistance, and avoid unnecessary competition among industries, there should be a sound organization to remedy weaknesses in business operations. Export trade should gradually seek to no longer rely on foreign merchants. (3) Import quota system. There are three difficulties in implementation. First, various countries regard us as a market for goods, and agreeing on quotas is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger. Second, most importers are foreign firms, and they may be unwilling to comply. Third, after implementation, the business volume of domestic merchants will shrink, inevitably leading to opposition. The first item is the most difficult. If the first item is resolved, the rest will be easily solved. Our country's current situation is generally seen by all countries. There is a maximum limit to the amount of foreign goods a country can sell. If it is poor to the highest degree, due to the decline in purchasing power, the import of goods will inevitably decrease sharply. Our country already has this situation. If this continues, import trade will gradually decrease even without restrictions. If, unfortunately, China's economy experiences a final total collapse, the commerce of various countries with China will also perish. If import restrictions are implemented, allowing our country's economy to recover, the benefits to foreign businesses in China will be significant. Most foreign entrepreneurs and bankers probably understand this meaning, so negotiating restrictions is not absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>Promoting Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Promoting domestic goods - this slogan has been around for many years, but it has not had much effect. The important reasons are: (1) affected by exorbitant taxes and domestic turmoil; (2) the people lack patriotism. In the future, we should seek: (A) the effective abolition of exorbitant taxes to lift the shackles on production. Although local governments cannot completely abolish exorbitant taxes due to financial difficulties, if private production cannot develop, industry, commerce, and finance will all be doomed. Local officials should be supervised, focusing solely on perfunctory orders and regulations, and extorting merchants and people by other methods under the guise of nominally abolished taxes. (B) Stimulation of national patriotism. Learn from Russia and Italy, firmly uphold the spirit of national planning, sacrifice personal comfort, and purchase domestic goods to promote the development of domestic goods. If domestic goods are as cheap and of good quality as foreign goods, there would be no need to promote them.</p>
<p>Frugality Movement</p>
<p>The country is like a family. In times of poverty, consumption must be reduced. Our country's industry and commerce are not yet developed, but the people's standard of living is increasing day by day. According to economic theory, increased living expenses or expanded consumption can encourage production and prosperity in industry and commerce. However, in our country, which is filled with foreign goods, the result of expanded consumption is that most of the money flows abroad, absorbing foreign goods and overwhelming domestic goods. Therefore, the national frugality movement, reducing the trade deficit of foreign goods, is also a way to save the declining national economy, etc.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying to go to Beijing tomorrow to find a solution</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Provincial Relief Association telegraphed various charities in Shanghai yesterday, urgently requesting relief for thirteen counties in the province that have suffered from floods. The original telegram stated, "Shanghai Red Swastika Society Headquarters, Fundraising Association for Drought Relief in Various Provinces, Sino-Foreign Relief Association, benevolent sirs, we presume you have received our telegram. The third flood in Jiangxi Province, as of today, has reportedly affected thirteen counties, including Wu Ning, Xiushui, Yongxiu, Xingzi, Poyang, Shangrao, Gaoan, Jinxian, Dean, Xianze, Nanchang, and Xinjian.

<h3>The Bureau of Weights and Measures Sends Personnel to Inspect Rice Industry Measuring Instruments</h3>
<p>Inspection to be implemented from today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bureau of Weights and Measures has determined that the measuring instruments used by rice shops in the area are mostly not in compliance with regulations, being either too small or too large, causing much confusion. It was specifically decided to start the inspection on the 20th of last month, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs ordered the industry to comply. At that time, the industry claimed that the measuring instruments were essential for business operations and could not be removed at the moment. If they were sent for inspection as scheduled, it would inevitably cause difficulties in business operations. Therefore, they submitted a document requesting a ten-day extension for preparation of replacement measuring instruments. It is now learned that the extension period has expired. The industry association is notified again, and its members are instructed to comply. Starting today, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day, the bureau will send personnel to the association to inspect the measuring instruments of members. The deadline is one month. It is heard that after the inspection, a detailed inspection will be conducted at each shop, and if any violations are found, they will be punished.</p>

<h3>Gu Songmao Writes to Request Explanation Regarding Payment Suspension of Cash Shop Checks</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that Shanghai rickshaw merchant Gu Songmao wrote a letter to Qin Runqing, chairman of the Money Industry Association, yesterday, saying, "Dear Sir, I have learned that the silver and money industries in our country were originally intended to provide merchants with a place to deposit funds and facilitate financial transactions. Suppose a certain cash shop opens in Shanghai, issues several checks totaling a certain amount of yuan, and the payee goes to the shop to withdraw the money upon maturity, but is refused payment. The next day, the shop publishes a statement in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao, stating that the above checks are related to a financial dispute between the shop and a certain account, and that payment will be suspended until the dispute is resolved. To resort to such bizarre means, when the shop is still in business, how can it use the excuse of being involved in a dispute with another account to refuse payment of checks? Is there a clear indication of money industry practices? I am at a loss and hereby write to request that your association provide a detailed explanation and promptly reply. I eagerly await your response."</p>

<h3>Yang Yongnian Newly Establishes World Rubber Factory</h3>

The Scissors brand has been exclusively sold by Shanyi Shenxiang Company and is scheduled to officially start business early next month.</p>

<p>Commits Suicide Due to Inability to Afford</p>

The woman wanted Wang to buy furniture, but due to recent financial difficulties, Wang was unable to comply. Feeling despondent and unable to face his new concubine, he committed suicide at home on the morning of the 6th by ingesting raw opium.

<h3>Public Concession: Rickshaw Pullers Oppose Tax Increase - Annual Tax Amount to Exceed Vehicle Cost - Four Resolutions Passed to Achieve Goal</h3>
<p>The rickshaw pullers of the Public Concession are in a state of panic because the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council has recently made a decision to increase rickshaw taxes starting in the autumn. A portion of the rickshaw pullers, being natives of Nantong, already sent a letter to the Nantong Association in Shanghai a few days ago, requesting intervention to stop the increase. All the rickshaw pullers held a general meeting of rickshaw puller representatives yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Nantong Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road. Over 500 representatives attended. Shen Yong was elected as chairman. After the opening formalities, the chairman reported on the Municipal Council's illegal tax increase and the purpose of the meeting, stating: "In this time of market depression and industry decline, all citizens living in Shanghai seek to reduce rent and taxes. However, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, the highest administrative authority in our special district, does not consider the difficult times and goes against the trend. It has suddenly decided to increase the taxes on rickshaws by more than double starting this autumn, oppressing the laborers. The price of a rickshaw is, at most, twenty yuan. The amount of the increased tax by the Municipal Council, calculated over the four seasons of the year, exceeds the cost of the rickshaw. This puts the rickshaw business in a dead end. This matter concerns our vital interests. I hope that all the representatives present will unite in opposition and discuss ways to cope with it." Subsequently, all the representatives unanimously passed the following resolutions: (1) To establish the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association; (2) To appoint Shen Yong, Gao Youyu, Cheng Zhongdao, Ye Wenhua, Zhu Miaogen, Qian Miaosheng, Zhang Wenyuan, Zhang Baoshi, Cui Hesong, Ding Boliang, Jiang Ade, and others as representatives to petition the Chinese Ratepayers Association in the Concession, requesting assistance; (3) If necessary, all rickshaw pullers will carry their vehicles to the Municipal Council to petition, and will not yield until the goal of stopping the tax increase is achieved; (4) To issue a declaration.</p>
<h3>High Tide Expected in Huangpu River - Tide Date Before Dawn on the 19th - Tide Will Not Flood Banks Unless Weather Changes Drastically</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been extremely gloomy recently, with continuous moldy rain and a chilly climate. In the fields, both the prolonged rain and the abnormal climate hinder the growth of cotton and rice. The following is a report from a correspondent of the Datong News Agency regarding these situations.</p>
<p>Continuous Moldy Rain</p>
<p>Shanghai has recently experienced continuous moldy rain, with a sudden drop in air pressure. The sky is dim during the day, and it feels like autumn, unlike mid-summer. It is said that summer is acting like autumn. In the fields, both the prolonged rain and the reversed seasons will inevitably damage cotton and rice. The weather forecast offers little hope of sunshine, and farmers are inevitably worried.</p>
<p>Huangpu River High Tide</p>
<p>Due to continuous rain in the Yangtze River basin, both upstream and downstream areas have reported flooding. Shanghai, being close to the coast and lacking northeast winds in the summer, has not been affected much. However, according to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's prediction, the 19th of this month will be one of the highest tide days in the Huangpu River for the past seven months, which is worth noting. If there are no strong winds or heavy rains, the high tide will not flood the riverbanks.</p>
<p>Date and Time</p>
<p>The following is the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's prediction for the tide time on the 19th. The start time of the high tide has not been determined, but the time of the fastest rise will be at 1:20 AM, when the current speed will reach 2.3 nautical miles per hour. By 2:05 AM, it will have reached its highest point, measuring 11 feet 7 inches (1 foot 5 inches from the Bund riverbank). It will begin to recede at 5:13 AM and will be completely gone by noon.</p>
<h3>Demao Grain Store Closes After June Accounting</h3>
<p>According to the Shenshi News Agency, the Decheng Grain Store on Doushi Street in the South City of Shanghai, established in August of the 20th year of the Republic, has been in business for four years, dealing in various grains, mainly peanuts, and has also been dealing in imported rice in recent years. Its credit has been good. However, the store recently suffered losses in its peanut business and was affected by the economic downturn, leading to a financial crunch. It suddenly declared bankruptcy the day before yesterday, with debts totaling approximately 100,000 yuan, of which 60% is owed to customers and 40% is owed to silver houses. The bankruptcy has not affected other businesses in the city much, except for Jardine Matheson, which has incurred some losses. The store's capital was approximately 20,000 yuan, and the manager was Ling Zihe.</p>

At the same time, the outpatient department has been expanded and famous physicians have been appointed for diagnosis. The following are the details.</p>
<p>Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Since hiring Du Yuesheng as the president and Wang Xiaolai as the vice president, the hospital, originally scheduled to open on the 1st of this month, was postponed to yesterday (the 7th) due to the expansion of the outpatient department and the addition of equipment. It is stipulated that eight famous physicians will provide free diagnosis from 9:00 AM every day.</p>
<p>Added Outpatient Clinic</p>
<p>In previous years, the hospital only admitted infectious disease patients day and night and did not have an outpatient clinic.

<h3>Human Hearts Difficult to Fathom - Rickshaw Puller Robs His Employer - Apprehended and Detained in Police Station - Commits Suicide Due to Fear of Crime</h3>
<p>Cao Zhitou, a 29-year-old man from Funing, Jiangbei, was working as a rickshaw puller for He Xing Rickshaw Company, owned by Xi Jieren (26 years old, from Chuansha) at No. 10, Mingde Lane, Boer Road in the French Concession, for three years. He had been honest in character and was praised by his employer. Therefore, Cao recommended his younger brother Cao Zhiyi and friend Chen Xinzhang to work in He Xing Company. At 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, the company owner gave 622 yuan in banknotes to his cousin Xi Jingren (33 years old, from Chuansha) to put in his pocket and take the rickshaw pulled by Cao Zhitou to the French Municipal Council on Jingzhong Road to collect the rickshaw license. When Cao Zhitou pulled the rickshaw to the turn from Avenue Joffre to Maiyang Road and traveled north for a few steps, Cao suddenly became greedy and stopped the rickshaw. He suddenly changed his ugly face and snatched the 632 yuan in banknotes, divided into two packages, from Xi Jingren's pocket while walking north. Xi Jingren, being lame, got out of the rickshaw and limped after the robber, shouting "Thief!" Patrolmen and pedestrians heard the shout and helped to chase and capture the robber. Seeing that it was difficult to escape, Cao retreated. The victim and his associates dragged him into the Fuxi Road Police Station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, he ordered him to be detained for further investigation. Patrolmen took Cao down and detained him in Detention Room No. 3. At 8:00 PM that afternoon, the police chief ordered the investigating detective to bring Cao out and send him to the Lujiawan Central Police Station for verification. When the investigator opened the iron gate of Detention Room No. 3, he discovered that the detainee Cao Zhitou had committed suicide in detention out of fear of crime by tearing a strip from a broken blanket in the detention room and hanging himself from the iron railing. His body was cold to the touch. The investigator reported to the police chief, who ordered the body to be sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch morgue for autopsy. After the incident, the police station sent detectives to He Xing Company to investigate and found that Cao Zhiyi and Chen Xinzhang, who were recommended by the deceased, were also missing. It is speculated that the three of them must have made a prior agreement to wait on the road to rob. The deceased, because he did not see the agreed-upon people on the way, acted on his own to rob. Yesterday was a regular holiday, and the weather was hot, so it was inconvenient to delay the body. Therefore, yesterday, the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court, led by Chief Prosecutor Qiao Wanxuan, went to the morgue with a forensic medical secretary to examine the body. He declared that Cao Zhitou had indeed committed suicide before death and that the body should be buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall.</p>
<h3>Pudong Qin Ci Yang Temple: Terrifying Strange Noises from Xiao Ham Nei, a Large Green Frog Scares Many Villagers, Brave Man Chen Jinbao Captures It, Calming Hearts, When Stretched Out, the Frog is About One Foot Long</h3>
<p>West of the Pudong Qin Ci Yang Temple, behind Wangjia Street, there is a small pond, not connected to the tides, hence commonly called "Heaven-Dropped." Recently, for several nights, terrifying strange howls have emanated from within the pond. The sound is quite loud, like an angry ox bellowing, continuous and unceasing. After the night is quiet and still, the sound vibrates for about a mile. The concerned villagers are all alarmed and uncertain. The bolder ones form groups at night and go to the pond's edge, using electric torches to illuminate it, but the calling does not stop due to the crowd.</p>
<p>After this strange event spread, it caused a sensation far and wide. Every night, hundreds of people came to the area to investigate, causing the pond bank to become packed. However, for four consecutive nights, no trace of anything was seen, and the strange sound became louder and more intense. Ignorant and foolish people were perplexed and at a loss, all suspecting it was a "divine ox" calling, a sign of a coming flood, with much talk of "turning pale at the mention of a tiger." A small number of intellectuals then proposed that the Pudong District Fire Brigade use pumps to drain the pond to see what was at the bottom. The night before last, as soon as it got dark, even more people went to investigate, numbering over a thousand, crowding from the pond's edge to the road. The mystery was soon solved. A local man named Chen Jinbao, aged twenty-nine, living southwest of Yangjing Town at the Bu Family Residence, who was a shoemaker, was simple and brave by nature. That evening, he drank a little wine to bolster his courage and also brought an electric torch with a friend to observe the strange phenomenon. Watching until 8:45 PM, he suddenly saw a green, strange head on the south bank, protruding from the water, resembling a frog but particularly large. When the calling sound came out, the eardrum of the frog's head was seen to vibrate greatly. He then concluded it was undoubtedly a frog. He did not undress and jumped into the pond, swimming to the opposite shore. Under the illumination of several electric torches, he quickly and skillfully captured this strange animal. Upon inspection, it was indeed a huge, unparalleled frog. Seeing the crowd of onlookers, Chen could not escape, so he carried the frog into a house on the south bank, dug open a hole in the wall, and disappeared. At this time, the strange sound was no longer heard. However, countless viewers, not having seen the truth, all returned disappointed. Yesterday morning, Chen put the large frog into a bamboo basket and placed it in front of the Yongxing Trough Workshop on West Yangjing Street, allowing people to view it. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, he carried it to the Cao'an Tou Security Team, west of where it was captured. Chen Xing-sheng, the standing committee member of the team, hung the basket on a poplar tree for all to see. A reporter saw that the frog, from head to tail, was about six inches long. When its four legs were stretched out, it was about one foot long. Its two eyes were like large coins, and its two eardrums were like copper coins. Its back was all greenish-black, and its belly was already showing red. Approaching it with the nose, one smelled a pungent odor. According to Chen himself, he had weighed it, and it weighed one catty and four taels. Inquiring among the village elders, all said they had never seen such a thing. Even this kind of strange calling sound was unheard of, they said. After the strange frog was captured, the villagers, who had been panicked for four or five days, were finally at peace.</p>

<h3>Swapping Ancestral Property of One Fen of Land Results in a Tragic Incident of Multiple Stabbings; Zhu Miaofu Acts Like a Madman, Randomly Wielding a Knife; Zhu Afu, Caught Off Guard, and His Entire Family are Injured</h3>
<p>Zhu Afu, along with his brothers Zhu Laobing (deceased) and Zhu Guixin, have lived at 491 Kang Nao Tu Road for generations. A tragic stabbing incident involving multiple injuries occurred due to the swapping of inherited property. The details of the incident are recorded below. Zhu Laobing had no sons, only a daughter who is already married. Zhu Guixin has three sons, the eldest named Miaofu. Zhu Afu has two sons, the eldest named Loubao, who operates a car. The property of the eldest brother was inherited by the second brother, and they had been living peacefully. Behind the residence, there is a vacant plot of land, approximately three fen, jointly owned by the three branches of the Zhu family. Each branch should get one fen. Recently, Zhu Afu and his son Zhu Loubao, along with relatives and the local land officer, approached Zhu Guixin and his son Zhu Miaofu, seeking to transfer the one fen of vacant land behind the house to the second branch for management, in exchange for a side room. Zhu Guixin and his son expressed their agreement. Unexpectedly, Zhu Miaofu suddenly regretted the agreement and refused to make the swap. Suddenly, at approximately 7:00 PM on the evening of the 29th of last month, Zhu Miaofu, holding two kitchen knives in both hands, burst in through the back door of Zhu Afu's house. At that time, Afu was dining with his wife, Zhu Wangshi, and his son, Zhu Loubao. Without asking any questions, Miaofu began to randomly slash at people with the knives, acting as if he had gone mad. Zhu Afu and the others were caught off guard and were all cut. Zhu Afu sustained six or seven knife wounds to the top of his head, and Loubao sustained five knife wounds to his left wrist and chest. Zhu Wangshi was cut the worst, with more than a dozen wounds all over her body. Soaked in blood, she fell to the ground in extreme pain. Zhu Loubao desperately escaped the dangerous situation, shouting for help. However, when he ran to the front gate, he was blocked by Miaofu's mother, Zhu Yaoshi, and Miaofu's wife, Zhu Cuiying, who refused to let him go out to call for help. At that time, a neighbor named Chen Er (from Shandong) suddenly heard the cry for help and rushed in without hesitation. Miaofu was in the process of randomly slashing Zhu Wangshi. Chen Er was horrified at the sight and attempted to snatch the knife, but was instead cut in the arm and other places by Miaofu. Other neighbors had also arrived, fearing a major disaster. They called the police, who arrested Zhu Miaofu and Zhu Yaoshi, along with the two bloody knives, and escorted them to the Caojiadu Precinct for transfer to the local court for questioning and detention. The injured Zhu Wangshi lay in a pool of blood, unconscious and barely breathing, because her skull had been cut. In critical condition, she was immediately transported by car to the Guangren Hospital for treatment. Chen Er, Zhu Afu, Zhu Loubao, and the other three injured people also went to the hospital to have their wounds bandaged. All four injured people were admitted to the hospital for treatment. Zhu Afu immediately hired lawyer Shan Yunhui to draft a complaint and sue in court. Zhu Loubao, fearing that Zhu Wangshi's life was in danger, went to the local court with Chen Er to request an examination of the injuries. Inspector Li conducted an inquiry, and then ordered them to return to await further instructions.</p>

Three wooden imitation pistols and eighty-seven double-horned yuan notes, and a five-yuan bill were found. They were all taken to the Public Security Bureau for detention, awaiting transfer documents. The police station first sent the suspect Shen Zhiqing to the First Special Court's criminal court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, presented the case according to Article 328, Section 1, and Article 330 of the Criminal Code, and requested the court to prepare official documents for the police station to transfer Wu Lian'gen and the other four suspects to the case for interrogation.

The four major uses are: 1. As a perfume essence, 2. As a hair tonic, 3. As a skin toner, 4. As a flower dew water. The price is also very low. Recently, the central and western pharmacy distribution center has been forced to ship goods due to remote foreign shipments, and the retail store is also in the low-price period, so there is a large supply shortage. It is heard that the pharmacy's low price is only for three days, so buyers should buy it early.</p>

<h3>Preface to the Song Dynasty Edition</h3>
<p>The Photographic Reproduction Society of the Song Dynasty Edition of the Buddhist Canon, located at No. 714 Weihaiwei Road, Shuibu, is publishing the Jisha Edition of the Buddhist Canon. Wu Jichen, a lay Buddhist from Zhenjiang, specially wrote a preface to introduce and circulate it. The preface reads: Since Buddhism flourished in the central plains, the oldest, finest, and most meticulously compiled edition of the Buddhist Canon in our Suzhou has been the Song Dynasty Jisha Yansheng Monastery Edition. Its initial publication was during the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty, and it has been passed down for over seven hundred years. The remains of the Yansheng Monastery are still in Chen Lake, and although the dilapidated walls remain, the name is still the same. However, searching for even a fragment of the printing block has long been futile. The vast expanse of the lake makes it impossible to know when it was lost. Yet, the printed edition remains in Qinzhong, radiating light and displaying auspicious signs from thousands of miles away. This is beyond the comprehension of worldly wisdom and the ability of human effort to preserve. It is truly a rare and magnificent destiny within Buddhism. As for we people of Suzhou, we view this as a precious Dharma treasure that has not perished with the world's calamities. The spirit and aspirations of the monks and laypeople of Yansheng Monastery who contributed to its publication are still present each time we open a scroll, appearing before our eyes. We should be especially joyful and grateful. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao and his colleagues have gathered together to plan its photographic reproduction and distribution. I, Zhao Zeng, without considering my own limitations, have eagerly responded to this mission. The tasks of compiling, proofreading, collecting, and printing have already been entrusted to those who have readily assumed responsibility. However, the task of urging circulation also requires utmost dedication and effort. I dare not be discouraged in the slightest. Therefore, I will inform everyone I meet and everywhere I go, whether they are monks or laypeople, believers or non-believers, about the merits of the Jisha Edition, so that they may achieve self-cultivation and help others. First, I requested a copy of the canon for the Shaozong Library in Zhenjiang. This spring, upon completion of the canon, while recovering from illness in the library, I compared it with other commonly available editions and discovered that there were many single characters and phrases that could correct errors and clarify obscurities. In the future, I will use it to compare and examine the Ming and Qing Dynasty editions, which will undoubtedly yield even greater contributions. Furthermore, the colophons within the canon contain a wealth of information that can be used for research and has a profound connection to society. I will briefly list them below to dispel the doubts of those who believe it has no practical value. (1) From the colophons, we can determine the historical facts of the printing. The scribes, painters, and printers of the sutras and Buddhist images each have their names recorded. There are over twenty scribes, including Imperial Physician Yu Xianfu from Songjiang, Jinshi Huang Yaoshou from Yun, Baiyai Ni Shizhong from Tiantai, Wang Chu from Huating, Zhou Changsun from Runan, and Lü Yizheng, Shi Zongyuan, Zhang Changzong, and Shen Mao. In addition, many are monks, such as Xing Qin Zhichen, Zhi Kai, Ru Yuanhui, Che Shi, An Shi, Xi Zu, Mao Qing, Man Zhi, and Jing Gong, all of whom are well-known. The printers include Zhu Yi, Zhu Zhiddao, Zhu Zhengyi, Zhu Ming, Chen Yuquan, Chen Xiu, Chen Dachang, Chen Junxi, Chen Xiaolang, Chen Yonghe, He Yongyan, He Hao, He Junbao, Xu Shen, Xu Jian, Xu Dayou, Zhang Renzhong, Wen Zhongwu, Huang Sheng, You Ren from Jian'an, You Qian, Xiong Geng, Li Qi, Yu Ji, Ding Chunian, Chuan Fang, Gong Rihua, Ying Zihua, Jiang Wenmao, Zong Rong, Weng Yin, Weng Xin, Fan Rong, Fan Maoqing, Shen Xiufeng, Niu Zhao Bijian, Liu Renzhong, Su Run, Yin Yiqing, and a man from the South China Sea. The names "Feng Niu" and "man from the South China Sea" are quite unique. Although only Chen Sheng is recorded as the painter of the Buddhist images at the beginning of the sutras, there are four printers: Sun You, Yuan Yu, Chen Ning, and Chen Bokong. Each of their styles of printing and painting has its own unique characteristics. By distinguishing their styles and describing their systems, a specialized monograph on woodblock printing could be created. (2) From the colophons, we can understand the changes in social prices. For example, Sun Shi Niang, granddaughter of Yang Jiu, donated fifty strings of cash to the official association to engrave one scroll of the Zhuyan Sutra on the Realm of All Buddhas, which is within the 156th volume and consists of ten and a half blocks. Chen Shi Liuwu Niang donated thirty-seven strings of cash to engrave one scroll of the Moonlight Boy Sutra, which is within the 159th volume and consists of seven and a half blocks. Each block has five pages, each page has six lines, and each line has seventeen characters, totaling five hundred and ten characters. If we calculate the cost of engraving at five yuan per thousand characters according to the current price charged by Jiang Junwenqing in Dangjia Lane, Nanjing, it would be 2.55 yuan. However, according to the engraving cost in the Song Dynasty, it would be five strings of cash or more. Therefore, by examining the cost of handicrafts, we can understand the economic situation at the time and the extent of its difference from today. (3) From the colophons, we can see the terms of address for large families. For example, Geng Shi Qianba Niang of Yang Twelve, Chu Wu Ba Lang, daughter one of Chu, Liu Shi Qianshi San Niang, daughter four of Chu Qi Shi Er Chengshi Wei, and Liu Shi Qianshi San Niang. The numbers Qianba and Qianshi San are truly astonishing. They must be determined according to the great ranking within their clan, which is a relic of the patriarchal organization. The equal ranking of men and women still reflects the style of previous generations, with no difference in status at birth. However, the number of women is often several times greater than that of men, which is a sign of the higher or lower birth rate. (4) From the colophons, we can study the evolution of engraving in various regions. For example, "the second kiln of the lower sand field of the nineteenth bao of Changren Township, Huating County," "Gu Xuanpu of the fifth bao of Quanwu Township, Kunshan County," "Changba Zi Weitian of the twenty-eighth du of Jiuyong Township, Wujiang County," and "the upper section of Huangjia Fu of Dao'an Township, Chongming Sand, Chongming Prefecture." All place names are extremely detailed and mostly belong to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with occasional references to the northern capital. Whether the district divisions and names are still used today, and whether there have been any changes, can all be used as reference for local historians. (5) From the colophons, we can reveal the social thoughts of the Song Dynasty. The wishes of individuals belong to the private sphere and are generally for two things: the deceased to be reborn in the Pure Land, and the living to have healthy bodies, harmonious families, and speedy recovery from illness. However, the public wishes, such as "may all sentient beings in the Dharma Realm attain perfect wisdom together" and "may everyone increase their longevity and eliminate disasters," are quite in line with the modern ideal of universal harmony. I am delighted that this canon has been completed. This rare Buddhist scripture from Suzhou, which has been passed down for over seven hundred years, has been revived in the world. I hope that everyone will gain right knowledge and understanding, make great vows, and work for the benefit of the country and the people. Starting from Suzhou, may it spread throughout the country and the world, swimming in the sea of compassion and living in the heaven of peace and happiness. Then we will not have failed the mission of circulating this canon. Therefore, I have written this preface to state its purpose. The Shaozong Library was built by me and a few friends, taking the meaning of the Wen Zong Pavilion of the Qing Dynasty. This canon was originally printed in Pingjiang and is now being photographically reproduced in Shanghai, which is still within the territory of Suzhou. It is being offered to my library to increase the sense of local pride. It is also a karmic connection, so I have attached it here. Written by Wu Zhao Zeng of Zhenjiang in the seventh month of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Linghu Zhao)</p>
<p>Marconi, the inventor of radio, said: "The reason why Chinese science is not developed is that it lacks true scientific methods." Indeed, when it comes to scientific methods, we have never paid serious attention.</p>
<p>We do not need to trace back thousands of years, even in the last one or two hundred years, most academic studies still adhere to the clichés of the ancients. To put it bluntly, we have undoubtedly been poisoned by "liking to read books without seeking thorough understanding"!</p>
<p>As for Confucius's "only" method of teaching, it was nothing more than advocating that "extending knowledge" lies in "investigating things." However, the method of "investigating things" has never been explained concretely.</p>
<p>Bacon tells us that the true scientific method is determined by the combination of (1) observation, (2) experimentation, (3) classification, (4) analysis, (5) hypothesis, (6) induction, (7) synthesis, and (8) laws and theories.</p>
<p>Finally, I must say that studying science with the attitude of "liking to read books without seeking thorough understanding" will only lead to national demise.</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Countryside</h3>
<p>— Kangjian Zhaifu</p>
<p>Once one has become accustomed to living in the city, one fears returning to the countryside. But when one returns to the countryside, one feels a sense of tranquility and comfort. Looking at the green fields, listening to the sounds of cicadas, tasting fruits and melons, walking barefoot and carefree, without any restrictions. The crowing of chickens, the barking of dogs, the singing of birds and frogs replace the noisy and irritating sounds of the city.</p>
<p>A few days of plum rain have awakened the withered and yellowing grain seedlings, revealing a new and tender vitality across the fields. The cotton seedlings were initially so dry that they could not sprout, but after the rain, the weather turned cooler, and the seedlings grew vigorously, though still stunted and undeveloped. The work in the countryside is not intense. Many old, young, male, and female people want to sell their labor but cannot find work. The daily wage for odd jobs is not even enough to buy a day's worth of oil and rice.</p>
<p>Because the plum rain was late, many fields originally planted with beans and cotton were temporarily replanted with sweet potatoes. The sweet potato vines are in greater demand than supply, selling for one hundred and forty cash per catty, which in previous years, when there was a surplus, was worth less than half a cent.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, in our village, no matter day or night, one could hear the sound of looms weaving all year round, producing large quantities of coarse cloth that were sold to the Northeast. In the early summer season, every household was busy picking mulberry leaves and raising silkworms. In recent years, the silk industry has declined, and the price of cocoons is not even enough to cover the cost of mulberry leaves. The market for cotton cloth has also been completely cut off. Thus, these two major rural sideline industries have both declared their demise. The peasants' lifeblood is only being sucked, not injected. Even the minimum social obligations for weddings, funerals, and celebrations cannot be completely abandoned and returned to a state of isolation until death. Pawnshops have become granaries for storing grain. Modest prosperity has turned into decline, and decline has turned into poverty. Strong men flock to the cities to pull rickshaws and work as coolies; healthy women crowd into the cities to work as maids and wet nurses. The honest and loyal old folks stubbornly defend the already broken rural barriers, quietly waiting for the will of heaven to turn things around.</p>
<p>The countryside goes bankrupt and people flee to the cities; the cities collapse and people return to the countryside; going back and forth they all hit walls. Where is the way out?</p>
<h3>Camel</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>On the streets and in the alleys, there are often wandering performers leading a dirty and skinny camel. Sometimes they shout about fortune-telling with the camel, and sometimes they claim the camel can cure diseases. Behind them is always a large group of children shouting and watching. Some stand far away, throwing small stones at the camel. The bolder ones approach the camel and pat its belly. The camel seems to ignore all this, just following its owner, aimlessly, dragging its heavy feet, and moving its huge body forward step by step. Sometimes, it will bend its legs and rest for a while while its owner is telling fortunes or treating illnesses.</p>
<p>The camel is such a huge animal. Although it is not as intelligent as a horse, and it is not as cunning as a mule, it has a talent for bearing burdens and traveling far, which no one can match. It can carry heavy loads, walk with the gait of a gentleman, and traverse vast deserts where it is impossible to discern directions. It can use the special physiological structure bestowed by nature to carry its own abundant food and drink. Although in the eyes of people, it is a tool for transporting goods, I feel that in a certain era or in a certain region, the camel also bears the responsibility of connecting cultures. Great is the camel.</p>
<p>However, in the city, especially in our great eastern city, the camel has declined. The impression it gives us is extremely ugly – it has become a guise for wandering swindlers to cheat people out of money.</p>
<h3>Nothing Is as Difficult as Eating</h3>
<p>— (Ji Yijie)</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, in a lecture at the Wuxi Educational Institute, said, "Every Chinese person must learn the ability to eat, everyone must be able to be a rice bucket, not only learn to have the ability to eat for oneself, but also learn to give others the ability to eat. If a person has this ability, making a million or two million will not be a problem. If you don't have this ability, not only will you not be able to get rich, but you will probably freeze and starve to death." Mr. Wu's remarks were a personal testament, full of wit and humor. Compared to the late Li Pusa's commonplace saying "Everyone has rice to eat," it is even more meaningful.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Bitter Words Cannot Pacify Wave-Like Hearts, Empty Tables Are Slapped, the Sound of Money and Festive Lights Pitifully Sell a Person</p>
<p>Zhiqian turned the lamp in the room down to a small flame and walked out into the courtyard. In this open space, there was a pile of green bricks for building houses, and he flashed into the brick pile. Looking, a beam of white light from a flashlight was shining in the open space. Then the tea boy led a few people over. It was Yang Wanhua, Sister-in-law Hu, and Zhu Yueying. Sister-in-law Hu said: Yueying, why do you have to listen to Master Jia? You are not a child, don't be so stubborn. Aren't we poor? If we have food to eat, why would we have you decide such an important matter as your lifelong happiness? Zhiqian waited for them to pass and immediately followed quietly behind. Yang Wanhua said: This is very good. Master Jia is very rich, and you will have endless food and clothes in the future. Zhu Yueying let them talk, but she just lowered her head and walked. When they arrived at the second courtyard in front, which was outside Jia Duocai's house, Yueying stopped. There was still a kerosene lamp in the courtyard that had not been extinguished. Zhiqian stood at the corner of the wall, and from afar, he saw that the girl's face was a little pale. She turned her head to Sister-in-law Hu and said: You don't need to send me in. Go back and persuade my mother and grandmother not to cry. I know my own business, we are poor, my life is like this, I… Yang Wanhua immediately stepped forward, held her hand, and dabbed her face with her handkerchief. Then she led this pitiful girl into the room. Before long, Yang Wanhua came out, closed the door, and then the cloth curtain on the window also covered the lamplight. Zhiqian was in the corner of the wall, only seeing the tea boy who led the way making a face at the two women. It was like an actor on the stage making an expression at the close of the curtain.

<h3>Records of Imperial Incense, Misty and Fragrant</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Of course, I had to obey, and I escorted the four imperial physicians to another side hall like a supervisor. This place was already separated from the Empress Dowager's bedroom by two palace courtyards. Although the hall was also very tall and clean, it was very desolate and had a musty smell because it was rarely visited. On the four walls, rows of wooden shelves were nailed, and on each row of wooden shelves, countless white and brown porcelain jars were arranged. Each jar had a lid, and the outside of the jar was marked with a small square of red paper with the name of the medicine contained inside, so that it could be easily retrieved; some medicines that were not very large were often packed together in one jar. So there were no less than five or six hundred kinds of medicines stored in this large hall, probably all complete, only a few kinds that had to be fresh were supplied by the outside pharmacies. Now let's talk about the four old gentlemen, the imperial physicians, who took this fifth prescription - the four prescriptions they had prescribed themselves had already been torn up by Li Lianying - although they might not agree with it in their hearts, how dare they argue with the Empress Dowager? They had no choice but to follow her and began to prepare the medicine in pairs. Although I guess that since the four of them were all old doctors who were very old, they must have been with these medicine jars for a very long time and were very familiar with them, they were still as slow as beginners when preparing the medicine, and had to look at them carefully before they dared to take the medicine out. It is said that this was also because they were cautious and unwilling to be perfunctory. After each medicine was taken out, they had to use a small balance to carefully weigh out the appropriate amount, and then wrap it into small packets with red paper, which were held by a small eunuch.

<h3>Locust Suppression</h3>
<p>— Shen Shouruo</p>
<p>Locust nymphs have been discovered in Haidang! The average farmer does not seem to be aware of it and does not immediately take measures to exterminate them. They don't know that the damage they cause is worse than that of bandits looting!</p>
<p>It is still the government that has a sense of foresight. As soon as they received the news of the discovery of locust nymphs, they acted as urgently as if fire was approaching, and immediately sent personnel to the countryside to gather many people and use the vitality of the Baojia system to organize locust extermination teams. They directed them to dig a small trench around each locust nymph nest, as a small encirclement line; at the same time, they dug a long trench around the concentrated area of locust nymphs, a little further away, about two or three feet wide and three or four feet deep, and dug a deep pool every four or five feet in the trench, as a large encirclement line facility.</p>
<p>After the two locust extermination lines were set up, a general mobilization began. Under the command of the commander-in-chief, some held wheat whips to drive them out of the reeds; others poured kerosene and set fire to them. The locust nymphs were suddenly attacked by two heavy blows and had no choice but to jump and flee. It is strange to say that their jumping and fleeing followed the wind, for example, if the south wind was blowing, they all jumped and fled to the north; it is said that the sound of their jumping and fleeing was like thousands of troops and horses, which was very noisy.</p>
<p>They encountered disasters in their haste. In addition to those killed or burned on the spot, most of them jumped and fled, some falling into small trenches and dying; even if they were lucky enough to escape, they still jumped forward, but when they reached the edge of the large trench, they fell into the trap one after another and became prisoners, without exception. However, they could still jump in the trench, but when they jumped into the deep pool in the trench, their lives were completely over! It is estimated that tens of millions of prisoners were trapped in this battle, and the victorious songs of triumph still have echoes in the countryside today.</p>

<h3>Climbing Lingyan After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>It was the eighteenth change of the plum rain season. When I got on the bus in the morning, the weather was still so clear, but when the train drove into the platform of Suzhou Station, it began to rain pattering in the sky, and it was so tight. We got off the bus and saw that the rain was getting heavier and heavier, and it didn't seem to stop at all; so we went into the tavern in the station, each drank a cup of milk coffee, ready to wait for the rain to lessen a little before calling a car. But after sitting for a full two hours, not only did the rain not lessen, but it was pouring down even more happily. However, we still had to take a boat to get to Mudu on the same day; so the three of us hired a horse-drawn carriage and proceeded towards Xumen in the thunderstorm.</p>
<p>When we got off the boat, although the rain was smaller than just now, it was still falling intermittently, and the clumsy big boat was sailing in the drizzle. As usual, we squeezed together to chat, crack melon seeds, chew bubble gum, and look at the scenery outside the window.</p>
<p>When the boat arrived at Mudu, the rain had passed and the sky had cleared, but the streets were still muddy; fortunately, the boat wharf was not very far from our destination, so twelve copper coins could hire a rickshaw to pull us to the door.</p>
<p>Mei, Ying, and I hired three rickshaws, and in less than five minutes we arrived at Zhen's house. Zhen was so happy to see us.</p>
<p>The streets slowly dried up, and the boats in the river at the back door were so crowded that they could not move. I ran to the end of the alley across the street to take a look. I felt that a mountain, a field, and a row of rivers were all very cute; the spire of the pagoda on the top of Lingyan Mountain proudly seemed to pierce the clear blue sky, and a few wisps of milky white silk were flying around the mountain peaks. "The mountain peaks are green after the rain, and the waves are red when the sun rises," I couldn't help but feel that my naughty child's heart was also forced to become active by this beautiful environment.</p>
<p>"Mei, let's go play on Lingyan Mountain; the scenery after the rain is very lovely, let's not miss this good opportunity"! I came back and excitedly said to Mei and others; Zhen raised an objection:</p>
<p>"Okay, naughty child, take a rest and go play tomorrow; besides, the mountain road after the rain is so muddy…"</p>
<p>After a long argument, victory finally belonged to me, Zhen, Ying, and Mei all accompanied me, stepping on the slightly damp grass path, and passing through the fields. There was a "Come Again Tomb" under the hillside, where there was nothing special to look for except for a plum forest shaded by green trees.</p>
<p>The four of us climbed up the mountain road paved with bricks, and when we climbed halfway up the mountain, we were already panting and unable to support ourselves. Mei, Zhen, and Ying were left far behind me. I sat in the "Welcoming Smile Pavilion" and waited for a while before they caught up, but several pieces of thin silk and gauze shirts were all soaked with sweat.</p>
<p>"What hot weather, you came to suffer"! Zhen looked at me hatefully and said.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the top of the mountain, the main hall of Lingyan Temple had just been completed; we went to linger for a while in many places with historical sites such as "Wu Wutai", "Xi Shi's Dressing Table", "Fairy Cave", and "Foolish Man Waiting for His Wife".</p>
<p>Standing on the stone rock, looking around, all the lakes, mountains, scenery, and rural houses were all taken into our eyes, and the clear wind brushed our sleeves, at this time we felt like we were about to become immortals!</p>
<p>"How childish, but our contrived behavior seems very pitiful"! On the way back in the twilight, we took a mountain sedan chair back, but a sense of emptiness overflowed from the depths of my heart…</p>
<h3>Record of a Skilled Doctor and Effective Medicine</h3>
<p>— (Woven Clouds)</p>
<p>The young artist, Wang Dichen, traveled to Europe in his early years, visiting countries like France, Italy, and Germany, thus achieving profound accomplishments. After returning to China, he became an art professor at a certain university in the Northeast, highly respected by the entire school. However, although Mr. Wang was approaching thirty, he had dedicated half his life to art, and his desire for a family had not yet been fulfilled. A female student named Fang Ruizhi was in the school. She was of marriageable age, with jade-like beauty, and excelled in both character and academics. Moreover, she had a deep passion for art, hence holding a profound admiration for Professor Wang. Beyond the academic discussions between teacher and student, they could not help but feel moved. After a semester, their teacher-student relationship blossomed into love, leading to a formal marriage. How beautiful was the love created through art! However, after the September 18th Incident, the three northeastern provinces fell, and the university disintegrated. Mr. Wang hastily fled to Beiping with his family. Grieved by the loss of the country and the displacement of his family, he suffered profound emotional wounds. Consequently, he resorted to the ways of indulging in wine and women, seeking solace in fleeting pleasures, recklessly engaging in debauchery. For a young and promising man to throw himself into the abyss of lust was truly regrettable. Ms. Fang never expected her husband's behavior after arriving in Beiping, neglecting their livelihood and instead engaging in such demoralizing actions. How could she know that the world of romance was full of serpents and scorpions? Mr. Wang squandered a fortune in three months of continuous indulgence. Most heartbreaking and shameful to his wife, he contracted a venereal disease. Initially, he tried to endure it in silence, but after a few days, it spread to his wife. Ms. Fang then discovered that her husband, amidst the national crisis and family misfortune, was still pursuing fleeting pleasures, causing them both to suffer from this shameful disease. Overwhelmed with anger and resentment, she confronted him sternly. Mr. Wang confessed the truth and deeply repented, offering extreme comfort, thus preventing a major upheaval. For the next three years in Beiping, the couple supported themselves by selling paintings. Although their relationship remained good, the illness lingered, and all medicines proved ineffective. Furthermore, Ms. Fang was unwilling to seek medical treatment. Although Mr. Wang sought treatment, his condition only improved intermittently, resulting in no offspring, the crystallization of their art, for three or four years. Last year, upon receiving an invitation from a large company in Shanghai to work as an art designer, the couple traveled south together. However, due to the strain of travel, the disease recurred. He experienced great pain while working. Fortunately, a colleague who had contracted gonorrhea from frequenting brothels was cured at the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital at 64 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. He often expressed his joy at being rid of the disease. Mr. Wang inquired about the situation and, after confirming its truth, decided to seek radical treatment. The hospital used the latest shortwave diathermy combined with injections and oral medication. After ten days, he was completely cured. However, Ms. Fang remained unwilling to seek medical treatment, suffering from leukorrhea constantly, which gradually weakened her body. She was also cured by the hospital's internal white discharge pills and external white discharge medication, each costing only two yuan per box. The couple's joy was beyond words. From then on, Mr. Wang and Ms. Fang's artistic endeavors were no longer hindered by physical and mental impediments. This summer, Ms. Fang gave birth to a son, commemorating the crystallization of their art. Is this not due to the skill of a skilled doctor and the effectiveness of good medicine? The reporter, being a colleague of Mr. Wang, knows the details of this matter particularly well.</p>

<h3>Shanghai China Football Team's Southern Expedition and Visit to Hong Kong; Mai Li Unable to Join; Zheng Jiliang Difficult to Enlist</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) The Shanghai China Football Team, invited by the Batavia Sports Association, is embarking on a southern expedition to Java. All travel expenses are borne by the Qunli Association. As the National Games are approaching, the China team is using this opportunity to train its players. Therefore, after receiving the invitation from the Qunli Association, the National Sports Association authorities selected players and organized a strong team. Regrettably, famous players such as Feng Yunqiu, Wan Xianghua, and Jia Youliang were unable to leave Shanghai due to personal matters. Only twelve strong athletes departed from Shanghai on the French mail ship "Aramis" on the 29th of last month, arriving in Hong Kong at 6:00 AM on the 2nd of this month. When the ship docked at the pier, reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers, as well as football stars Li Huitang, Cao Guicheng, Mai Su, Li Guozhao, and He Jiaqiang, were present.</p>
<p>A Small Warm-Up</p>
<p>Led by Yu Hengzhi, the team warmed up at Caroline Hill after arriving in Hong Kong. Observing the forwards, their kicking seemed quite strong. Jiang Lu, having just tried his legs, did not show any brilliance. The center-backs' play was average and rather lackluster. The team's weakness lies in this area. Xu Heng has been beaming with joy since his engagement to Ms. Yu. His high ball handling remains as solid as ever, but when it comes to low balls, Brother Heng still sighs in despair. In addition to the Shanghai team as the base, the China team has recruited several Hong Kong star players. The team lineup is listed below:</p>
<p>Xu Heng</p>
<p>Li Ning Jiang Shanjing Guan Xun'an</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng Chen Zhenxiang Liang Shutang</p>
<p>Jiang Lu Sun Jinshun Li Yichen Chen Jiaqiu Zheng Jiliang Zhong Yongsheng Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Brief Evaluation of Strength</p>
<p>The team's overall strength appears quite formidable on the surface. The forwards are composed of warriors from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Three Ports, but their coordination may not be as smooth as desired. Furthermore, the two main players, Li and Sun, are overweight, which will inevitably hinder their progress down the line. Jiang Lu and Cao Guicheng have been out of practice for a long time, and they may not be able to achieve effortless success when facing strong opponents. The strength of the center-backs is exceptionally weak and insufficient to defend against the attacks of strong forwards. Goalkeeper Xu Heng can only catch high balls. If faced with low balls, he can only bow and invite the ball into the goal. Moreover, the forwards of the South Seas football teams are renowned for their bottom-ball shots. With Brother Heng guarding the goal, the situation is precarious.</p>
<p>Cao and He Miss the Boat</p>
<p>Cao Guicheng and He Jiaqiang were originally scheduled to depart on the same ship on the 2nd, but the French ship left Hong Kong at 12:00 PM on the 2nd. He Jiaqiang mistakenly believed that the ship would depart at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. Cao Guicheng also made the same mistake, so neither of them was able to catch the ship. The flying general had to lament his inability to fly. The French mail ship left Hong Kong on that day for Saigon. He and Cao had to change to a Dutch ship on the 5th to travel to Singapore to rejoin the team. Mai Shaohan was urgently recalled to the province by the Air Force authorities due to important matters and was unable to make the trip.</p>
<p>Chen and Xu to Join?</p>
<p>Since Mai and Li were unable to serve the China team, Mr. Yu consulted with Li Huitang after arriving in Hong Kong and invited Chen Zhenhe and Xu Yahui to participate. However, Chen and Xu are students at a provincial school, which will only begin its vacation on the 15th of this month. The sea voyage from Hong Kong to Java and back takes more than a month, making the time too short. Currently, they are unable to attend classes on time. If Chen and Xu can request leave from school in advance, they can depart on the same ship as Cao and He.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Borrowing Players</p>
<p>The Shanghai China team has only twelve players for this southern expedition. If any players are injured during the matches, there may be no replacements. Therefore, Yu Hengzhi originally planned to borrow four players in Hong Kong. However, due to the inability of Mai and Li to join, Mr. Yu's last hope is to invite Zheng Jiliang or one or two strong players from Singapore to bolster the team's strength. However, as far as this reporter knows, the Singapore football season has not yet ended, and the regulations of the Singapore Football Association are very strict, requiring any Singaporean footballer who wishes to accompany another team on an expedition during the football season to first obtain the association's consent. For example, several years ago, when Zheng Jiliang and Chen Yushu accompanied the South China team on an expedition to Java, it was enforced once, resulting in Zheng and Chen being suspended from competition for one year. For this trip of the Shanghai China team to Singapore, it is unknown whether Zheng Jiliang will be able to obtain the Football Association's permission to depart with the team during the football season.</p>
<p>Level of Competition</p>
<p>The team was selected by the Batavia Qunli Association. The first match of the China team's southern expedition will be held in West Dong. They will not compete during their stay in Singapore. They will play approximately fifteen matches in Java, including four in Batavia, three in Surabaya, two in Bandung, one in Solo, one in Yogyakarta, two in Semarang, and one in Madiun. They will only compete in Singapore upon their return.</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun Speaks</p>
<p>Football General Sun Iron Leg sent his wife south, but Sun still departed with the team. Beforehand, this reporter had heard that Mr. Sun would stay in Hong Kong next season to play for the China team. I asked Mr. Sun whether this was true. According to Mr. Sun, whether he will come to Hong Kong is still undecided. After this southern expedition and return to Shanghai, if he remains in Shanghai, he may play for the Eastern China team, but it is also uncertain. It was also found that Mr. Sun's family is also accompanying him on this trip, including four little iron legs. The eldest, Fukang, is six years old, while the youngest is still in her arms. Fukang is lively and adorable, confirming that tigers beget no canine offspring.</p>

<h3>Beiping City Middle Schools Oppose Co-Education Ban; Telegraph Ministry of Education to State Reasons; Refuse to Accept Social Bureau Order</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Beiping Mayor Yuan Liang is banning co-education in middle schools. The Private Middle School Joint Association held a meeting and decided to telegraph the Ministry of Education, ordering the Beiping authorities to maintain co-education in Beiping's private middle schools. At the same time, the Social Bureau ordered all private middle schools not to enroll female students and to report the names of female students. The private schools decided not to accept the order. The text of the order and telegram are recorded below:</p>
<p>Social Bureau Order: The Bureau previously received an order from the Municipal Government to draft measures to ban co-education in private secondary schools and to submit them for approval. The Bureau immediately drafted measures and submitted them. Recently, Municipal Government Order Zheng Zi No. 3620 stated that the submitted items were not yet perfect. The government has determined other methods as follows: (1) The Bureau will use the real estate left by the city party headquarters to establish a second girls' middle school that can accommodate twelve classes. (2) The First Girls' Middle School will also be expanded to twelve classes. Students from the existing co-educational private schools will be absorbed into these two schools as much as possible. If this is not enough, the Bureau will instruct the private girls' schools in the city to expand their classes and accommodate them as much as possible. The co-educational private schools should be ordered to recruit male students to compensate. If this is done, the purpose of separating boys and girls can be thoroughly implemented, and the private schools will not face any difficulties. You are hereby ordered to follow these instructions, quickly draft a plan and submit it for approval, and implement it at the beginning of the next academic year. This order: You are ordered to comply with this order and submit a list of all female students, including their names and grades, by July 10th to facilitate their transfer to other schools. It is also noted that the Ministry of Education promulgated regulations in November 1933 to prohibit private schools from establishing branch schools. Recent reports indicate that a few schools are enrolling female students under the guise of branch schools, which contradicts the Ministry's order and the intention to ban co-education. After this notice is issued, all recruitment advertisements from these schools should uniformly remove the words "recruiting female students." If they still fail to comply, they will be severely corrected. You are hereby ordered to comply with this order.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Education: Ministry of Education, Nanjing: Co-education in Beiping's middle schools has been practiced for many years and has been filed with your ministry. Recently, we heard reports that the Beiping authorities intend to ban co-education. Although we have not received a formal order, the Social Bureau suddenly ordered all schools to withdraw advertisements for the recruitment of female students, which is shocking. Co-education is common throughout the country. Why does Beiping discriminate? We respectfully ask your ministry to maintain the original plan and not allow arbitrary changes. We are eagerly awaiting your instructions. The Beiping Private Middle School Joint Association.</p>
<h3>After Banning Co-Education, Beiping Decides to Establish a Second Girls' Middle School</h3>
<p>(Beiping, July 7th, Electric Dispatch) After Cai Yuantan of the Social Bureau received an order from the Municipal Government to ban co-education, he repeatedly consulted and recognized two difficulties for private schools in separating boys and girls: (1) The Ministry of Education stipulates that middle schools with twelve classes or more can only add vocational classes. Many of Beiping's private schools already have a large number of classes, reaching the number set by the Ministry. If they are allowed to separate classes, the number of classes will double, conflicting with the Ministry's regulations. (2) If private schools are allowed to separate boys and girls, it will conflict with the Ministry's regulations prohibiting the establishment of branch private schools. Therefore, after considering the results, it was decided to establish a second municipal girls' middle school and expand the First Girls' Middle School to achieve the goal of separating boys and girls.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Specialist Li Jiaxiang Resigns</h3>
<p>In April 1933, when the Ministry of Education sent five personnel who had been studying education in Europe back to China, they were all appointed as specialists. This was the beginning of the Ministry's appointment of specialists. Specialists were appointed officials, receiving the highest grade of salary for recommended officials, with a status close to that of simplified appointment. (Later specialists, such as Zhou Tianfang, had served as directors of education departments, and Sun Guofeng had served as deans of university colleges. Therefore, after Shen Pengfei resigned from Jinan University, there was talk of him becoming a specialist. Specialists all had very good qualifications). The five personnel who returned from European studies as specialists were reportedly appointed for a term of three years. Apart from Chen Qibao and Yang Lian, who became directors of the Anhui Education Department, and Li Ximou, who became dean of a college at Jinan University, there were also Li Jiaxiang and Guo Youshou, who served in the ministry. Li Jiaxiang had previously taught in the UK. Zhu Jiahua, when serving as Minister of Education, specifically telegraphed and invited him to go to Europe for study. He was appointed as a specialist upon his return to China. Before completing his three-year contract, he resigned from the Ministry due to his rigid nature and accustomed life of teaching. He was recently hired as a professor by a certain university and has resigned from the Ministry of Education. He has not been to the Ministry since the 6th. The Ministry of Education now has another specialist vacancy.</p>

<h3>Notice from the Chinese Students' Association in Germany Regarding Studying in Germany; Requires a Year's Study Certificate from a University; Monthly Living Expenses in Germany: 200 Marks</h3>

<p>No Difficulty in Transferring Schools: German universities exist in every city. The organization of each university is completely uniform. Therefore, German students can freely transfer from a university in one city to a university in another. They only need to complete the required semesters and courses before participating in the national examination or doctoral examination. Transferring schools is not difficult.</p>
<p>Second Semester Opening: German universities stipulate two semesters per year. The first semester begins on March 15th, according to the latest regulations, and ends at the end of June. The second semester begins on September 15th and ends at the end of January. Within half a month of the start of each semester, students must re-register with the school. If they are too late, they must explain the reason to the president of the school in order to be approved.</p>
<p>Required Documents: The most important document for Chinese students studying at German universities is a Chinese high school diploma. Recently, a certificate of completion of the first year of a Chinese university is also required to be admitted as a regular student. Otherwise, they must be a special student for one year before being admitted as a regular student. Chinese students studying in Germany should pay special attention.</p>
<p>Various Expenses in Germany: Tuition is 80 marks per semester, miscellaneous fees are about 23 marks. The cost of registering for each course varies, but on average it costs at least 150 to 200 marks per semester. Room rent is 30 to 40 marks per month, and food and spending money are about 100 to 150 marks. Given the current living conditions in Germany, at least 150 to 200 marks per month are required, excluding tuition and book fees.</p>

It is said that the most important points are three: (1) a plan to guide students to serve the community in their spare time, (2) to supervise student spending entrusted by parents, and (3) to set up a reading life committee to designate teachers proficient in history, geography, Chinese, English, and mathematics to guide students' extracurricular research. In addition, it is heard that the school's summer remedial classes will begin on the 10th of this month, with scheduled classes for six weeks. Tuition is 5 yuan for junior high school students and 6 yuan for senior high school students. Boarders do not pay accommodation fees, and boarders pay 10 yuan for six weeks. Students can enroll regardless of whether they are students of the school.</p>
<h3>Graduation Ceremony of Jiangsu Provincial Medical and Political College</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang, 7th Dispatch) The first graduating class of the Jiangsu Provincial Medical and Political College's health administration and education departments, as well as the special training class, held a graduation ceremony on the 7th.

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop to Hold Second Long-Term Camp; Starts on July 14th for One Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop has achieved excellent results since preparing the training of the troop members. The troop, noting that the youth in the prosperous Shanghai area have weak wills and that businessmen easily become decadent, and also because of the long summer vacation with much leisure time, has decided to conduct rigorous training to reverse the current decadent trend of youth and promote the national spirit of diligence. The troop has decided to conduct its second long-term camp for the fourth batch of troop members in advanced training, starting on July 14th and ending on August 10th. The troop trainer Ying Jing will serve as the camp commander. In addition to the troop members contributing a portion of the expenses, the rest will be allocated by the Chamber of Commerce at the troop's request. The campsite is chosen at Qujiaqiao in Jiangwan, for convenience and to avoid affecting the original occupations of the members.</p>
<h3>News from Various Schools</h3>
<p>Quanzhang Middle School: Quanzhang Middle School, located on Longhua Road and Dapu Road in this city, was ordered to reopen last autumn. It has recently been approved for registration by the Municipal Education Bureau. The teachers hired for each subject are mostly well-known figures. The school will be greatly expanded next semester and is actively preparing. However, the school's economy is declining day by day. To reduce the burden on students' parents, the school will further reduce tuition and accommodation fees and provide various scholarship and free education programs because the school has fixed income and does not rely on tuition income to maintain itself. Since the school began accepting applications, the number of people going to apply for the exam has been exceptionally large. The first entrance exam will be held tomorrow.</p>
<p>Guohua Middle School: Guohua Middle School on Gordon Road in this city was founded by Dr. Xiao Qian. Graduates of the school have always been known for their excellent English. Recently, the school elected Lin Kanghou as chairman of the school board and Zhou Xianchu to manage the school affairs. Many teachers have been hired, and a large number of books and instruments have been purchased to enrich the school. Business and elementary school departments have also been added, and emphasis is placed on extracurricular activities to cultivate students' practical knowledge and skills. The school has begun accepting applications for this semester, and the number of applicants is very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Mingde Women's Vocational Middle School: Mingde Women's Vocational Middle School and its affiliated elementary school on Jinrong Road in the city have added new school buildings due to the increase in students. They are now nearing completion and will be decorated during this summer vacation. All desks and teaching aids will be newly made. The classes in the summer tutoring school will all use a single-style system. The number of summer students has reached more than 400, and the number of new students applying to the school is particularly crowded. It is heard that in order to popularize vocational education, all students with equal levels will be admitted. When each classroom exceeds the prescribed number of people, classrooms will be added.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>Industrial Control and Production Restrictions</h3>
<p>— Pan Mingshan</p>
<p>Since the global economic panic occurred in 1928, the situation has become increasingly dangerous by 1934. The industrial, commercial, and financial sectors are struggling under extremely severe conditions. Economic trends have also changed as a result. In the past, free market policies were advocated, following evolutionary improvements. It was believed that after an extremely prosperous market, there should be a contraction, and then the economy would cycle back to a balance. However, it is not known how long this cycle will last, and how economic balance will be achieved. This is all based on hypothetical theoretical foundations. Therefore, due to practical needs, most economists advocate economic control. In an unstable market, one cannot rely on hypothetical theories. An extremely effective control method should be implemented as a remedy; otherwise, the entire social and economic organization will collapse. The Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan and the United States' National Industrial Recovery Act are examples of this.</p>
<p>Those who follow trends without thinking believe that the decline of Chinese industry and commerce can be saved by copying the successful control methods of Europe and the United States. However, each country has its own historical changes and different environments. How control is implemented is not something that can be achieved by simply copying successful methods. The United States' National Industrial Recovery Act focuses on restricting production to eliminate unfair competition. Because the industrial economy has been excessively developed, there is overproduction. Until the commodity market can adapt, the state of overproduction hinders the development of industry. Therefore, industrial control is implemented to restrict production and avoid overproduction, so that the commodity market is adapted to the production schedule. Then inventory will not accumulate, and sales will not be stagnant. The most significant characteristic is restricting production. Seven or eight tenths of the people in the Soviet Union are still farmers. Before the revolution, industry was not yet fully developed. After the revolution, the industry was still in its infancy. If production restrictions were implemented, it would be tantamount to promoting the sales of foreign goods. Therefore, production restriction methods were not adopted for industry. Each country has its own environment, and it is impossible to generalize.</p>
<p>The decline of China's industry, the increasingly acute economic panic, and the implementation of industrial controls to break this deadlock have gradually become concrete after advocacy by various sectors. However, how to control it requires a lot of discussion. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, stipulating that Japanese people could set up factories and manufacture goods in Chinese treaty ports. All countries, with the preferential rights of most-favored-nation treatment, were able to invoke it and set up factories in Chinese ports. China is rich in raw materials, and labor is cheap. Foreigners invested in China, set up factories in treaty ports to manufacture goods, using China's cheap labor and rich raw materials, with precise management and proficient technology. It is natural that their products are excellent, the cost is low, and the price is small. It is obvious that they will win and the inferior will lose when competing with our immature industrial products in the market. Moreover, factories established by our people in China are not subject to the supervision of our主管官廳. They use treaties and concessions as amulets and do whatever they want. To restrict the production of a certain industrial product, it is necessary to first investigate its national sales volume and production volume, and then learn whether the supply and demand are balanced, and whether there is overproduction. Let us not talk about the factories established by our people. Factories established by foreigners are not bound at all, and their production volume cannot be investigated. That is, the national production volume cannot be statistically determined. In other words, whether the national production volume of a certain industrial product exceeds the total sales volume and there is overproduction cannot be known in detail in principle. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The increasing decline of industry and commerce is partly due to the dumping of foreign goods and partly due to the bankruptcy of rural areas in the interior, which reduces purchasing power, resulting in an abnormal state of overproduction. This overproduction is abnormal. In fact, it is due to the narrowness of the sales field that this unnatural surplus occurs. If it is mistakenly believed that this unnatural overproduction is due to the excessive development of a certain industry in our country, then measures are taken to restrict production to reduce its production volume and adjust the balance of supply and demand. This kind of basis is actually wrong, because the overproduction of industry in our country is by no means due to the excessive development of industry, but to the saturation of production, which belongs to the extreme decline of industry, which cannot guarantee its territory, and allows the dumping of foreign goods, resulting in a shrinking sales field and no way to sell goods, forming an unnatural surplus pathological state. If we do not strive to invigorate and improve ourselves to compete with foreign goods, but restrict production, it is tantamount to creating dumping opportunities for foreign goods, and further promoting the decline of our country's industry. Therefore, whether restricting production can revive industry is doubtful. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Our country's industry is underdeveloped. Light industry has a slight beginning, and heavy industry is even more out of the question. If it is believed that the current production has overproduction and restrictions are placed on new establishments, it is like giving up eating for fear of choking. China's doors are wide open, and customs duties have not been fully autonomous. We cannot increase import taxes to prevent imported foreign goods, nor can we implement dumping taxes to prevent dumping. Moreover, due to the high price of silver and the low price of gold, countries have reduced their currency values, exchange rates have fallen, and goods are sold cheaply. If we restrict newly established factories, there will be fewer factories and reduced output, weakening our competitive strength, which indirectly helps to promote the dumping of foreign goods. This should be considered third.</p>
<p>To resist the dumping of foreign goods, it is necessary to increase our resistance strength. Industrial control is indeed a good medicine. However, control cannot start with restricting the establishment of factories and restricting production. On the one hand, we should actively increase production, improve technology, manage carefully, and install perfect equipment to reduce production costs and improve the quality of goods, in order to compete with foreign goods one day. On the other hand, we should expand sales channels and increase people's purchasing power. If sales channels are wide, production will not be excessive. If so, industry will have the hope of vigorous development, and the effectiveness of industrial control will be obvious. If we are limited to maintaining the status quo, we will be fundamentally wrong.</p>
<h3>My Opinion on Controlled Industry</h3>
<p>— Deng Boxi</p>
<p>(1) Doubts About Implementing Industrial Control</p>
<p>In recent years, various nations, in order to salvage their own economic panics, have competed to use our country as the final destination for dumping their surplus products. Not only is our newly emerging national industry suffering a fatal blow, but our entire national economy is also becoming increasingly precarious. It is undoubtedly proper to rectify our own ranks and engage in resisting dumping. However, this is something that "planned economy" can achieve, not something that "controlled economy" can accomplish. Currently, controlling industry is actually providing foreign industrial products with an opportunity to dump. This is the first doubt we have regarding industrial control.</p>
<p>Free competition is the backbone of capitalism. The so-called "mutual crushing" is a manifestation of free competition and an inevitable phenomenon under the capitalist system. For the past two centuries, the rapid progress of industry in various nations has its roots in this. Our national industry is only just budding and relies on "mutual crushing" to promote its development. How can we implement control to block its future? This is the second doubt we have regarding industrial control.</p>
<p>Moreover, is the so-called overproduction truly a real phenomenon? Even if it is said to be real, is the cause truly the "mutual crushing" among industrialists, leading to overproduction? This is an even more erroneous observation. Now, we want to use this mistaken observation to treat an unnatural phenomenon. This is the third doubt we have regarding industrial control.</p>
<p>Even taking a step back, if this observation is not wrong and this phenomenon is indeed real, it is still questionable whether industrial control, once implemented, can broadly expand markets and absorb this surplus production. From a practical perspective, in the current atmosphere of recession, how easy is it to broadly expand markets? To prevent overproduction, we may still inevitably resort to restricting production. Previously, the control plan of the Cotton Industry Production Control Committee took restricting production as its aim, which serves as clear evidence. Therefore, the result of implementing industrial control will not only fail to bring "critically endangered industries" to prosperity but will also accelerate their demise. Even if they can avoid death, at best, they will only maintain the status quo of existing industries, which is hardly sufficient to plan for future progress. Under the current siege of economic imperialists, we can no longer retreat to a self-sufficient agrarian age. We must advance towards "industrialization" to resist the invasion of foreign industrial products. How can we allow each other to hesitate, considering ourselves inferior and defeated? This is the fourth doubt we have regarding industrial control.</p>
<p>(2) The True Cause of Industrial Decline</p>
<p>Since the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century, due to the introduction of machines and the rationalization of management, the output of industries in various nations has greatly increased. However, the number of unemployed workers has also increased, and the purchasing power of the masses has become increasingly weak. It is difficult to find buyers for the increased production. Initially, fortunate wealthy families relied on the savings of previous generations to absorb it, so industry could still progress gradually. However, as these savings were almost exhausted, the responsibility of selling the "increased production" shifted to the masses, whose purchasing power was weakening daily. The masses were unable to bear this heavy burden. The sales channels for increased production narrowed, and overproduction and industrial decline were felt, leading to recession. Moreover, the more industry declines, the more unemployed workers there are, and the more the purchasing power of the masses decreases. The more the purchasing power of the masses decreases, the narrower the sales channels for industrial products become, and the more industry declines, which in turn leads to a weakening of the purchasing power of the masses. This relationship is like a circle without end, causing endless harm and impossible to uproot. The root cause lies in the weak purchasing power of the masses. From this, it can be seen that the weak purchasing power of the masses is truly the cause of industrial stagnation. Our country's industry is only just budding, and the output is still small. If there are no other reasons, the purchasing power of the masses should still be able to bear the responsibility of sales. However, in recent years, the rural economy has collapsed internally, the recession has surged externally, and dumping products have invaded. The purchasing power of the masses has weakened daily. The sales channels for domestic industrial products have narrowed, and the emerging industries have thus felt "endangered." Therefore, the result of creating weak purchasing power among the masses, leading to industrial decline, is one and the same. This is the true cause of our country's industrial decline.</p>
<p>(3) It Is Better to Increase the Purchasing Power of the Masses Than to Implement Industrial Control</p>
<p>Therefore, since there are so many doubts about implementing industrial control, and the weak purchasing power of the masses is the true cause of industrial decline, it is clear that in order to "save critically endangered industries" today, it is better to increase the purchasing power of the masses than to implement industrial control. How can the purchasing power of the masses be increased? The most important thing is the implementation of labor policies.</p>
<p>(1) Increasing Wages and Lowering Prices: Increasing wages will increase the income of workers, and their purchasing power will naturally increase accordingly, which is very obvious. However, currency is only a yardstick of value, not the essence of wealth. If wages increase and prices increase accordingly, then what is gained is still only a comparison of fifty steps to a hundred steps, and it is easy to say that purchasing power has increased. Therefore, increasing wages must be followed by lowering prices (referring to the prices of goods produced by workers), or keeping prices unchanged to maintain the value of wages, or simply lowering prices to increase the value of wages. If this is the case, the increase in wages can be said to be a real increase in wages. The effect of increasing purchasing power will then become apparent. This is what mass-productionists in the United States have implemented.</p>
<p>(2) Shortening Working Hours and Utilizing Technological Unemployment: Purchasing power has already increased due to the increase in real wages, but if workers do not have enough leisure time to use their purchasing power, the effect of increasing purchasing power on industry will be limited. Therefore, workers must be provided with leisure time to use their purchasing power, which means shortening working hours. In recent years, due to the progress of industrial technology, the need for manual labor has decreased, resulting in so-called technological unemployment. The world generally considers this unfavorable to workers and impossible to solve. In fact, if it can be used to provide workers with leisure time, allowing them to use their increased purchasing power, then it can turn disadvantage into advantage. For example, reducing working hours from eight hours a day to two hours a day, or reducing working days from 300 days a year to 75 days a year, while still receiving full pay for the remaining days. Assuming that advanced technology can complete the work of a full day in half a day, then workers can also use their quadrupled purchasing power to absorb this doubled production. Moreover, shortening working hours not only provides workers with leisure time to use their purchasing power but also creates new occupations. Because workers can use their leisure time to travel, read, paint, etc., occupations such as hotels, cars, steamers, bookstores, paints, etc., will arise as a result.</p>
<p>(3) Unemployment Insurance and Occupational Insurance: The purchasing power of workers has increased, and they have leisure time to use their increased purchasing power. However, if their occupations have no guarantee at all, then they would rather save their increased purchasing power for future food and clothing than use it for consumption. Therefore, after implementing the above two policies, it is still necessary to provide unemployment insurance so that workers can know that there is no suffering from unemployment and can use their purchasing power for consumption with peace of mind. However, this is only a remedy after unemployment and cannot completely dispel their concerns. Therefore, in theory, it is still necessary to provide occupational insurance so that their occupations can be guaranteed. However, in fact, as a result of implementing the above policies, the purchasing power of the masses increases, the sales channels for industrial products expand, industrial prosperity returns, the demand for labor increases daily, and workers can be free from the worry of unemployment.</p>
<p>(4) Industrial Control and Damage to the Purchasing Power of the Masses</p>
<p>The reasons why it is better to increase the purchasing power of the masses than to implement industrial control have been stated above. However, can industrial control and policies to increase the purchasing power of the masses be implemented simultaneously without conflict? This still needs to be studied. From a practical perspective, industrial control not only cannot be implemented simultaneously with policies to increase the purchasing power of the masses but is also completely opposite to policies to increase the purchasing power of the masses, because it is too damaging to the purchasing power of the masses. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>The harm of implementing industrial control, regardless of its impact on other aspects, will inevitably have two impacts on workers: (1) It is difficult for workers to find employment; (2) It is easy for workers to become unemployed. The former affects future workers, and the latter affects employed workers. Because under the current circumstances, controlling industry will inevitably result in restricting production, as mentioned earlier. Once production is restricted, the need for labor will naturally decrease, and it will be difficult for workers to find a place to sell their labor. Moreover, as a result of implementing industrial control, small factories often stand in an inferior and defeated position and will gradually be eliminated by large factories. The position of small factories is unstable, and workers may become unemployed at any time. Whether the impact is due to the former or the latter, it is enough to reduce the purchasing power of workers. It is very clear that it is damaging to the purchasing power of workers. This is an observation from the perspective of workers. Now, please observe it from the perspective of farmers.</p>
<p>Since the invasion of Western capitalism into our country, the rural economy has undergone rapid changes. As a result of machine-made products defeating handicrafts, farmers have abandoned their self-sufficiency plans and relied mainly on "exchange" with industrialists, eventually becoming slaves of industrialists and listening to their commands. If industrialists need raw materials, the types of crops farmers grow have to become simpler and serve as a supply of raw materials. (This can be evidenced by the fact that in recent years, various tobacco factories and yarn factories in Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces have encouraged the planting of cotton and tobacco.) If industrialists need a large supply, farmers have to use machines or improve technology to produce in large quantities and supply them. (This can be evidenced by the sharp increase in the import of agricultural machinery and the trial implementation of collective farms in recent years.) As a result of the occurrence of the first fact mentioned above, farmers have become a part of the industrial labor force, entrusting their lives to factories. If the result of implementing industrial control is that large factories eliminate small factories, then farmers who usually entrust their lives to small factories will inevitably be sacrificed and become unemployed, and their purchasing power will be lost as a result. As a result of the latter fact, there is a surplus of labor in rural areas. This batch of surplus labor flows into the cities and increases the group of laborers. If the result of implementing industrial control is that the need for labor decreases, then this surplus labor in rural areas will have no way to find a place to eat, and their purchasing power will be completely destroyed. This is the reason why implementing industrial control is damaging to the purchasing power of workers and peasants.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>The reasons why industrial control policies are damaging to the purchasing power of workers and peasants have been stated above, and we have understood that the weak purchasing power of the masses is truly the cause of the current industrial decline. Therefore, in order to "save critically endangered industries" today, we cannot implement industrial control and should strive to increase the purchasing power of the masses, which is even more needless to say.</p>
<h3>Japan's Wheat Self-Sufficiency Plan</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>In order to achieve self-sufficiency in wheat production, Japan increased the wheat import tax from 1.5 yuan to 2.5 yuan in 1932 (per dan, equivalent to 133 pounds). The authorities considered that the consumption of wheat for flour manufacturing was 5 million shi, and for brewing and other uses, it was 4 million shi. Therefore, in addition to increasing the tax rate, they also encouraged farmers who originally planted rice to switch to planting wheat. This plan was originally expected to be completed in five years, but it has made great progress in only three years. Before the wheat import tax was increased, the Japanese wheat market was often affected by the fluctuations of foreign markets, making it impossible to prevent the outflow of domestic wheat. And the operation of flour mills was no less than a speculative business. However, since the tax rate was increased, the domestic wheat market has been more stable under the protection of tariffs, and the business focus of major flour companies has also shifted from speculative opportunities to seeking reasonable profits. According to Japanese tax laws, when wheat purchased from foreign countries is milled into flour and then exported, the tax paid at the time of import can be deducted from the export tax. The goal is to export to foreign countries, but domestic flour mills mainly supply domestic consumption.</p>
<p>In 1934, the sales of flour had not yet escaped the threat that had begun in 1931. In 1931, the Japanese flour industry was affected by the economic pressure from the United States and the decline in rice prices. Moreover, due to competition with the rice industry, it had to lower prices. Although the Europeanized lifestyle is developing day by day, it endangers flour prices. If the price of flour is slightly raised, bread eaters will switch to eating rice. The following is a list of the amount of flour consumed in Japan in the past five years. Although the production of wheat has increased year by year, it can be seen from the table that flour consumption has not improved. (Unit: 1,000 bags)</p>
<p>1930: 36,448</p>
<p>1931: 36,266</p>
<p>1932: 32,125</p>
<p>1933: 33,425</p>
<p>1934: 34,000</p>
<p>(Note) Each bag weighs 48 pounds.</p>
<p>The consumption of rice was higher last year than in any previous year because the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry had purchased large quantities beyond what was needed. For this reason, according to general estimates, wheat consumption this year may be higher, reaching the figure of 1930. However, according to experts, due to the failure to relieve the economic pressure in rural areas, it may not be possible to obtain substantial profits, so the increase in consumption figures this year should not exceed 1,000,000 bags.</p>
<p>The main destination for Japanese flour exports is Manchukuo. However, the flour market in Manchukuo did not improve in 1934. Because the low prices in the world wheat market gave Australian flour merchants a great opportunity to compete. However, although Australian flour is still imported into Manchukuo this year, the quantity is gradually decreasing because the world wheat price is slightly higher this year. If the world wheat market cannot return to the high prices of a few years ago, the flour market in Manchukuo will inevitably be controlled by Australian flour. In December last year, the price of wheat fell, so Japanese wheat slightly improved. According to general estimates, the export of flour to Manchukuo this year may reach 14,000,000 bags, creating a new record. One of the reasons is that Manchukuo's wheat harvest last year was very poor and must be imported from Japan in large quantities. Although Japan has newly set a tax rate of 40 sen per bag this year, it may not affect exports to Manchukuo.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, the wheat self-sufficiency policy still cannot completely prohibit the import of wheat because wheat that is imported, milled into flour, and then exported can receive preferential tax rates. However, if we can continue to reduce rice cultivation and convert farmland to wheat, then exports will increase and imports will decrease, and the self-sufficiency policy should not be difficult to achieve success.</p>

<h3>Finance: Interbank Call Loan Rate Still at Two Cents, Subsidiary Currency Slightly Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, a bank holiday, so the market felt even more sluggish. In the money market, the interbank call loan rate was still two cents, as it had been for a long time. Transactions in call loans were generally the same as before. The turnover was approximately 2.2 million in the morning session, over 500,000 in new transactions, over 200,000 in the afternoon session, over 400,000 in small clearing house transactions, and approximately 200,000 in pawn shop redemptions. There were no new loans. No banknotes were redeemed or issued, but over 300,000 in marked notes were issued. Money shops collected and remitted over 3.2 million in foreign silver, remittances from various routes were over 300,000, and silver from other regions was 200,000, with 100,000 shipped to the interior. In addition, bank collections and remittances were temporarily suspended due to the bank holiday. As for subsidiary currency, the situation was weaker than before. Jiangnan small silver rose to 4 yuan in the morning session, opening at 834 yuan, but in the afternoon session, due to the lack of transactions, it returned to 830 yuan. Therefore, the result was still the same as the previous session. Only 5,000 jiao were transacted in the morning session, and none in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver opened at 734.2 cents in the morning session, then fell slightly to 733.5 cents in the afternoon session. Therefore, the result was a decrease of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day. 135,000 jiao were transacted in the morning session, and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins were at 341,000 wen, 500 wen lower than before, with a transaction volume of 30,690 strings of cash, equivalent to 9,000 yuan in silver.</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Fell Every Day Last Week, Financial Instability and Outflow of Spot Goods, Uniform Decline of Around Two Yuan</h3>
<p>During the week of July 1st to 6th, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was closed for two days due to the mid-year settlement. Therefore, there were only four trading days. The market was affected by the continuous supply of spot goods, resulting in an increasingly loose market. Although retail investors tried their best to support the market, their strength was limited. Although arbitrage reached 1.56%, there were few arbitrageurs, because the financial sector has been hit by a raging tide, and money shop arbitrage can be said to be extremely rare. Small banks are taking care of themselves and rarely inquire. Even Zhongjiao and other banks are also working on the overall adjustment of financial plans. Although they occasionally provided the market with support, it was only temporary. The bond market suddenly lost this heavy support, and it was not able to support itself. Due to the large number of gold short bonds, their market price fell significantly, and a new post-Minbian price of 68 yuan was discovered, breaking the record of 68.6 cents on June 13. The spot outflow of the Zhengliu bonds also saw a low price of 62.4 cents in July. The 96 bonds also fell by 67 cents due to the closing of long positions. In short, the current bond market is rarely affected by the environment and is deeply controlled by chips. The trend and future are that the financial sector still presents an unstable picture. Spot goods are still flowing out. All of these factors continuously hit the bond market. As a result of last week's market price, compared with the previous weekend, there was a uniform decline of more than one yuan to two yuan. Only the 18 Customs bonds rose by 2 cents, and the Xin Chang bonds were flat. The total turnover was 53,018,000 yuan. The following is a comparative table of the high and low results of the week (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 1,000 yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower: U.S. Cotton's Sole Rise Due to Resistance to Short Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with sluggish market conditions, with slight increases of one to six points per pound for each month. Subsequently, positive news from Liverpool and buying by traders, along with short covering ahead of the upcoming acreage report, gradually drove prices up. There were fewer deliveries, and spot traders made purchases. Both domestic and international traders showed appetite for near-month contracts. Mainland traders sold March contracts, while the government bought May contracts, with limited new buying and selling. Afterward, market conditions fluctuated due to the wheat and silver markets. There was a slight rebound before closing. As a result, spot prices rose 15 points per pound, and futures rose 10 to 14 points per pound. English cotton spot prices fell four points, and futures fell four to five points. Indian cotton initially fell with silver prices but later rebounded slightly due to short covering. Gujerat fell 0.75 to 1.5 rupees, Oomra fell 1.25 to 1.5 rupees, and Broach fell 2 to 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is on the left. (Dated 6th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Cotton Initially Firm, Then Weak, Last Week</h3>
<p>A New York telegram dated the 5th reported on the cotton market during the week, stating that the market was quite firm at the beginning of the week, and traders were active. However, due to uncertainties regarding loan amounts and other factors, trading was limited, and prices reached new highs. The sudden drop in wheat prices also caused a rebound. The possibility of the July contract price reaching over 12 cents could trigger deliveries from the Commodity Credit Corporation and loaned cotton, thus restricting buying. However, trading remained scarce. Domestic cotton mills are increasingly reducing operations. Favorable weather in the South could offset the low acreage figures. It is generally expected that a recovery in the autumn business season will lead to a healthier cotton fabric market. According to news from Washington, the Senate Agriculture Committee agreed to remove export subsidies in the amendments to the Recovery Act. Currently, many lawsuits are preventing the collection of processing taxes, and the matter will be transferred to the Supreme Court in the autumn. Reports of boll weevil infestations have been received from various states, but the damage is still minor. Attached is the weekend statistical summary (units: thousands of bales).</p>

<h3>Grains: Thick Japonica and Thin Indica Rice Rise by About Ten Cents</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, shipments from various guilds totaled sixteen, with over 3,000 shih of goods. Market conditions continued to rely on the drizzling rain, and people's spirits were good. On the sales front, there was some movement in this street. Qingdao guilds also purchased another 400 shih. Therefore, the prices of thick japonica and thin indica rice continued to rise by several cents to one dime. Yinbian Yuan remained unchanged.</p>

<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, only a dozen or so ships arrived from various guilds. Sales of various goods in the market were decent. White japonica was still relatively active, while Yin Yuan remained stagnant. Selling prices saw slight transactions. Thin indica rice was selectively high. The remaining goods were unremarkable. High-quality Zhongguan goods were priced several cents higher. Yin Yuan slightly decreased by one or two dimes. There was not much fluctuation in thin indica rice.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Drops by Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained weak. The guild quoted 15 yuan and 95 cents for spot coarse granulated white sugar and 4 yuan and 80 cents for transferred field goods, but no transactions occurred. Our store's goods were quoted at 16 yuan and 5 cents, with slight sales, a decrease of five cents. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was quoted at the original price but did not sell. Our refined white sugar had no buyers, and transactions were few. Only the Chaozhou guilds offered Chenzhi red sugar at 9 yuan and 70 cents and ordinary Longqing at 9 yuan and 25 cents, totaling less than 200 bags. There were no further offers.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: Hankou Tung Oil Increasingly Trending Upward</h3>
<p>Due to foreign firms closing their accounts last week, transactions of white tung oil were slightly thin. Recently, foreign firms have started purchasing again. According to detailed letters from Hankou, companies such as Fook Chong and Peng Sung have purchased 200 to 300 tons, with prices quoted at 41 yuan and 50 cents and 41 yuan and 65 cents. It is rumored that the American Mostyn firm is also in negotiations. Most of the goods imported by local firms are Zhejiang tung oil. Goods of standard quality are priced around 43 yuan per picul. Goods lacking quality vary in price due to differences in quality. However, with summer sales in full swing, stocks in various places are low. Therefore, the market is unlikely to decline significantly in the future.</p>
<h3>Metals: No. 5 White Lead Sheet is the Only Product with Strong Sales</h3>
<p>The metal market has been very sluggish recently. Tight credit and frequent floods have greatly reduced sales. However, No. 5 white lead sheet, which has been quiet for a long time, has recently seen a unique surge in sales. This is because battery factories have a strong demand. Yesterday, 60 to 70 barrels were sold, estimated at 22 yuan and 50 cents per dan. It is said that most of these sales came from iron merchants in the North Suzhou Road area. In addition, No. 2 to No. 12 colored sheets have not moved, and the situation is very quiet.</p>

<h3>The Medical Community of Tianshui, Gansu</h3>
<p>— Li Kangnian</p>
<p>Tianshui is a city sandwiched between high mountains on the north and south sides. Limited by its terrain, it can only develop towards the east and west ends. Therefore, the city has a long east-west and narrow north-south shape.</p>
<p>The people here have not yet had the opportunity to see cars or trains. Transportation relies entirely on livestock and manpower. However, the landing and takeoff of airplanes (there is an airfield here with an aviation team stationed) is a common sight.</p>
<p>Tianshui's ability to become an important town in southern Gansu is not only due to its thriving commerce but also to its significant military position.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the medical community here, it seems very developed on the surface, but in reality, it is very weak. Although there are a dozen or so shops that both diagnose and sell medicine, they are very small in scale. In addition to displaying some injectable drugs and hygiene products for venereal diseases, common medicines are very scarce (there are also several Beijing goods shops that also sell medicine).</p>
<p>Whether the business of new medicine can develop often correlates with the level of knowledge of the people. In general, ignorant people mostly hold a skeptical and distrustful attitude towards new medicine. When family members fall ill, they initially seek help from gods and Buddhas, burning incense ash in front of the Buddha's seat as medicine to take. If this is ineffective, they then seek treatment from old doctors. If that is also ineffective, they only find new doctors in the third step. However, by the time a patient's life has been extended to this point, they are already in critical condition. Even if they can be saved, it is a near-death experience.</p>
<p>In cities like Shanghai, it is said that the number of doctors is often excessive. However, in rural areas—especially in the northwest—it is really not easy to find a formal doctor. The biggest reason why formal doctors cannot penetrate into the interior to practice is that people do not trust new medicine, and the general poor people cannot afford the cost of medical treatment. Therefore, business cannot develop. Even if someone can penetrate into the interior, they are mostly very poor, and even daily life is difficult to maintain—the situation here is similar.</p>
<p>The government authorities pay great attention to medical and health undertakings. Last winter, they implemented a national medicine and new medicine examination. In the new medicine aspect, they casually admitted a dozen or so people and ordered all pharmacies not to sell drugs without a prescription signed by a certified doctor. However, not long after, everyone felt inconvenience, and they rose up in opposition. Now, people can buy whatever they want again.</p>
<p>There are many clinics that treat minor illnesses, such as injecting drugs for venereal diseases. However, apart from a hospital established by the Catholic Church, there are simply no formal hospitals with a relatively large scale.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church Hospital is headed by Dr. Xu Changhe, who recently came from Shanghai. The various facilities are quite complete. As the hospital is charitable in nature, it does not charge for outpatient services, only taking a small amount for medicine. Therefore, there are dozens of people seeking medical treatment every day. In the future, it will gradually gain the trust of the people, and its business will become increasingly developed.</p>
<p>What the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu urgently need to solve is the widespread prevalence of opium. It is heard that the government is quite serious about this issue and has ordered the establishment of a poor people's hospital and an opium addiction treatment center here. However, funding is not available, so it seems difficult to realize in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Regarding public health, apart from epidemic prevention injections and smallpox vaccinations, there is nothing to say. The generally stubborn people do not understand the benefits of epidemic prevention injections and mostly express unwillingness.</p>
<p>Due to the limited space, I can only briefly say this. However, I think that in this short article, you can understand a glimpse of the medical situation here. Written on May 13, 1935, in Tianshui City, Gansu.</p>
<h3>Recent Observations on Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>—Changes in Theory and Combined Therapy—</p>
<p>Since ancient times, although there have been various proofs of the theory of tuberculosis, from today's clinical experiments and recent observations, there have been many changes in the theory of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Is the pathogen of tuberculosis entirely due to the tubercle bacillus discovered by Koch? And is the tuberculosis transmitted since ancient times, Juberkel, a purely tuberculosis? Juberculose</p>
<p>Sohulz observed the literature of various countries and divided it into Koch type and Musch type.</p>
<p>Spanish physicians, such as Ferran and Ravetta, believe that the various morphological changes of tuberculosis are due to the combination and (accidental) changes of various bacteria. Tutntion</p>
<p>French physicians Calmette and Vaudremer, and American physicians Kahn and Sweany, believe that the various transformations of tuberculosis are formed by the self-changes of tubercle bacilli.</p>
<p>Previous observations, such as Koch's bacillus, were regarded as the pure tuberculosis pathogen. And the tuberculosis transmitted since ancient times was considered the formation of tuberculosis. We have mostly known this when we were studying in school in the past, but today, this theory is no longer completely valid.</p>
<p>Is the formation of tuberculosis (initial lesion) the beginning of tuberculosis? Is its theory still valid?</p>
<p>Ranke said that the beginning of tuberculosis is due to the formation of primary aggregates. Primaerkomplex Therefore, the diagnosis of tuberculosis must be established after changes in tuberculosis pathological anatomy (i.e., histologically) have taken place.</p>
<p>We must know that each infection is initially inflammatory and exudative, Exsudatin and then becomes productive tuberculous. (The establishment of tuberculous lesions requires a certain infectious power. If the infectious power is sufficient, it will become inflammatory exudative and productive. – When the infectious power is insufficient, that is, in mild infection, although there are local pathological anatomical phenomena, it becomes inflammatory, but tuberculosis cannot be established. – Ordinary mild infection of tuberculosis is the most common, which is undoubtedly).</p>
<p>Regarding the initial formation of tuberculosis, there is another observation, such as Petruschky's observation in 1897, which is still generally recognized. That is, inflammatory processes in the lymph nodes belong to tuberculosis. If found, it is inflammatory tuberculosis. After tubercle bacilli reach the oral or nasal cavity and throat, some pass through the tracheal mucosa, and others pass through the gastrointestinal tract to reach the local lymph nodes to which they belong. At this time, tubercle bacilli are the same as other infectious bacteria, and have the possibility of being completely eliminated. However, sometimes because tubercle bacilli have stronger resistance, they can survive in the lymph nodes for a long time (Bartel) and reach the blood circulation. If tubercle bacilli reach the blood circulation, the first organ is the lungs. When school-age children are ten to twelve years old, the proportion of cervical lymphadenopathy is greater than that of the lungs, but from twelve to fourteen years old, the opposite is true. Therefore, Schulz believes that tracheal lymphadenopathy is the transition of tuberculosis in children and adults.</p>
<h3>The Story of Gastric Juice</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Story Three—</p>
<p>After the Renaissance, people began to pay attention to the phenomenon of so-called "natural transformation" occurring in nature. For example: why does meat rot? Why do maggots appear in food? Why does milk sour? Why does grape juice turn into wine? Why does apple juice turn into vinegar? And, why does food change in the stomach? They thought all these were of the same nature. The rotting of meat, the growth of maggots, the souring of milk, and the digestion of food were all due to the action of natural transformation.</p>
<p>The first person to doubt this was an Italian named Francesco Redi. He divided the same food into two parts, placing one part in an open bottle and the other part in a bottle with a bottle mouth wrapped in parchment paper and wire gauze. After some time, the food in the open bottle grew maggots; the food in the other bottle did not, but maggots grew on the parchment paper and wire gauze wrapping the bottle mouth. This proved the unreliability of the "natural transformation" theory.</p>
<p>A Frenchman named Reanmur kept a beloved kite. He extracted some liquid from its stomach, put it in a bottle containing food, and the food dissolved. He also discovered that putting saliva in a bottle could also change certain foods, of course, those of a starchy nature. This was in 1782.</p>
<p>A famous British physician named Hunter once said angrily: "Some physiologists say the stomach is a mill; some say it is a fermentation vat; some say it is a steamer; but in my opinion, the stomach is not a mill, nor a fermentation vat, nor a steamer—it is just a stomach." But he did not explain what the stomach was or what functions it had.</p>
<p>Although gastric juice had long been discovered, scholars mostly held ridiculous views on the function of gastric juice. In 1815, there was a famous scholar in New York named Nathan R. Smith; he said: "Gastric juice is composed of many small viscous worms, and these worms gnaw and devour the food mass that enters the stomach, making them into a uniform soft chyme."</p>
<p>The discovery of the chemical action of gastric juice must be attributed to an accidental gunshot wound. On June 6, 1822, an Indian named Alexis St. Martin, who was in the border area of Mackinac, was accidentally wounded by a gunshot, and the skin, muscles, and outer wall of his stomach in his upper abdomen were shattered. A young American military doctor, William Beanmont, was invited to rescue this unfortunate victim. He sewed the edges of the wounded man's stomach and skin together and actually saved him. His stomach then had a hole. Beaumont saw his stomach churning. He saw gastric juice oozing out on the surface of the stomach, so he decided to experiment. He tied a piece of meat on a line and inserted it into Alexis's stomach. Half an hour later, he pulled the line out and saw that the edge of the meat had been eroded. After an hour, half of it was gone. After two hours, it was all dissolved. He discovered that gastric juice only appeared when food entered the stomach or when food was being chewed in the mouth. He used a rubber tube to extract some pure gastric juice and sent it to Professor Dunglison at the University of Virginia for chemical analysis, and the result was that gastric juice contained hydrochloric acid. This was the first time that pure gastric juice had been analyzed with thorough chemical methods.</p>
<p>Beaumont decided to keep Alexis at home as a servant in order to continue studying his stomach. But Alexis was not a docile experimental subject; he often got drunk, ran away in the middle of experiments, and did not return for days or months. But Beaumont waited patiently and persisted. In 1833, he published a book at his own expense entitled Experiments and Observations on the Gastric Juice and the Physiology, published by a bookstore in Plattsburgh, New York. This is one of the major events in the history of physiology.</p>
<p>In 1839, Beaumont retired from the army and practiced medicine in St. Louis, where he died in 1852. But his experimental subject outlived him. Alexis still often ran away drunk and was still famous for having a "stomach eye." He did not die until 1880. William Osler, a young professor of physiology in Montreal, heard the news and offered a large sum of money to his wife to buy the dead man's stomach. She refused him and buried her husband's body eight feet deep in the ground to prevent others from digging it up. This is indeed a pity, because if that widow had agreed to Osler's request, this stomach with an eye might still be preserved in the American Medical Museum for us to appreciate.</p>

<p>(Q) What is the prevention method for acute rheumatic arthritis?</p>
<p>(A) To prevent this disease, you must try your best to avoid colds and humidity on weekdays. Pay attention to whether there are infectious parts on the body, such as tonsillitis. If there is such a situation, you must have surgery to remove it quickly. After the onset of the disease, be careful to prevent its recurrence, and pay attention to climate changes. (End)</p>
<h3>Hygiene Knowledge for Ears, Nose, Throat and Eyes</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(54) Chronic Hypertrophic Rhinitis (Continued)</p>
<p>The nasal discharge of patients with chronic hypertrophic rhinitis is mostly a small amount of viscous, mucous fluid, sometimes mucopurulent, and yellow or green in color. If it is purely purulent, it indicates a concurrent suppuration of the paranasal sinuses. If we use a nasal speculum to examine the nasal cavity, we can observe that the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity is greyish-white or light red, or of normal color. The degree of swelling varies. The most obvious swelling is in the inferior turbinate, followed by the middle turbinate. Patients themselves can often probe the nasal cavity with their fingers and feel a lump of swollen flesh inside. This is the swollen inferior turbinate. The middle turbinate is located higher and deeper, so patients cannot easily probe it themselves. Although the swelling of the turbinate mucosa is similar, the anterior and posterior ends of the inferior turbinate are mostly significantly swollen, with a smooth, hemispherical surface. Sometimes one end has numerous incisions, becoming uneven. This condition is specifically called lobulated hypertrophy. Sometimes its posterior end becomes like a mammilla or raspberry.</p>
<p>Patients with this disease often develop chronic pharyngitis, chronic laryngitis, paranasal sinus disease, and otitis media. This is something to pay attention to. Speaking of its treatment, the first thing, of course, is to avoid all causes of the disease. Secondly, various local treatments are performed according to the nature of the swelling. Several commonly used methods are nasal irrigation, drug insufflation, application, and cauterization. If the mucosa has already proliferated and the swelling is severe, then surgery is necessary. There are three surgical methods: electrocautery, submucosal resection, and excision. All three surgeries are safe. As for which of the three methods is appropriate, this can be determined by a specialist doctor based on the extent of proliferation and hypertrophy. However, often patients are afraid of the pain of surgery and are unwilling to undergo it, resulting in prolonged illness and many complications of paranasal sinus disease. Therefore, in the event of this disease, it is better to seek early radical treatment and undergo surgery.</p>
<h3>Popular Lectures on Modern Venereology</h3>
<p>— Chen Shengbai (Compilation and Narration), Yin Muqiang (Proofreading)</p>
<p>Part Two: Gonorrhea</p>
<p>(2) Resistance of Gonococcus</p>
<p>A. Resistance to Temperature: Gonococcus has a very weak resistance to high temperatures. It dies within a few hours above 40 degrees Celsius. However, there is a difference between those in the human body and those in test tubes. There are cases where a body temperature above 40 degrees Celsius for several days still does not completely kill the gonococcus. Its resistance to low temperatures is also weak; it dies quickly below 10 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>B. Resistance to Drying: Gonococcus has a weak resistance to drying. It can die immediately in completely dry conditions. However, the danger of transmission often exists when pus is attached to hands, swaddling clothes, or utensils because it is more difficult to dry them. Therefore, even after two hours or more in a humid state, i.e., in warm water, it can still live and exert its infectious power.</p>
<p>C. Resistance to Disinfectants: The degree of resistance of gonococcus to disinfectants varies depending on the drug. This has significant implications for the treatment of gonorrhea and is a key point that we must pay attention to. Based on experiments by scholars from various countries, a brief outline is given below.</p>
<p>It is said that the weakest resistance of gonococcus to disinfectants, i.e., the most effective disinfectants, are silver preparations. Therefore, if they can be used well, it is not difficult to obtain good results in treatment. The relationship between gonococcus and silver preparations is described below.</p>
<p>The application of silver preparations to produce silver proteinates in the urethra has a significant inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. Moreover, when silver nitrate or Protargol is used, the silver protein still has a sustained effect. This is demonstrated in the secretions from experiments.</p>
<p>Not only the resistance to chemical preparations in experiments, but also the relationship between gonococcus and our tissues is a necessary condition for the treatment plan. In tissues, which contain proteins and salt, most disinfectants, such as mercuric chloride and silver nitrate, often combine with them to form insoluble substances. From the results of experiments, drugs such as mercuric chloride and silver nitrate, which are combined with proteins and salt, have a weaker bactericidal effect than when gonococcus is placed in plain water and the same experiment is performed. Therefore, if other silver preparations such as Argentamin, Argonin, and Protargol are used, which are less likely to coagulate protein and salt, their effectiveness should be more significant than mercuric chloride and silver nitrate.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a big difference between experiments in test tubes and actual application in the human body. The purpose of this description is to briefly illustrate the points to be noted in treatment.</p>
<p>(3) Location of Gonococcus</p>
<p>Regarding the location of gonococcus, it is the knowledge of clinicians and should be noted when examining gonococcus. The author believes that this matter is important, so a general introduction is given.</p>
<p>The existence of gonococcus varies depending on the stage of gonorrhea. In the early stage, polymorphonuclear leukocytes have not yet appeared in the mucus. At this time, gonococcus is mostly free in the mucus or attached to the surface of epidermal cells, and fewer exist within leukocytes. When the secretion becomes purulent, the number of gonococcus inside leukocytes gradually increases. In the late stage, the number of gonococcus inside leukocytes decreases again. As for chronic gonorrhea, gonococcus is mostly free in the secretion.</p>
<h3>Medical Science of Pain Relief (22)</h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Speaking of the causes of perianal fistula, the first is perianal abscess, and the second is that the buttocks have a lot of fat. The blood flow in the fat is very small, so the resistance is very low. Pus is very easy to expand, and it will become perianal fistula after a long time. Thrombosed external hemorrhoids can sometimes ulcerate and become perianal fistula. Anal fissures that are not treated in time can also become perianal fistula. A part of perianal fistulas is tuberculosis. We know that tuberculosis is not easy to cure no matter where it occurs. Secondly, because fat has very low resistance to bacteria and chemical decomposition, perianal fistula becomes the most obvious chronic disease. Although patients do not suffer severe pain, the annual and monthly pus discharge also reduces life's happiness a lot.</p>
<p>Speaking of pain relief, the fundamental treatment is necessary. If the problem is not good, it is impossible to completely remove the pain. The most reliable treatment is proper surgery. But casual surgery is also equal to zero, for example, cutting a small hole in the tube. The surgical method is better if the entire fistula tube is cut open. Some surgeons also completely cut off the fistula tube. Although the effectiveness is sometimes better, the surgery is more serious. There is little hope of cure without surgical treatment, but single-tube perianal fistula can sometimes be cured by injecting saturated silver nitrate. Although surgery inevitably causes some pain in the short term, it is a once-and-for-all solution. The results of this type of surgery are mostly safe and there are no special dangers. Since surgery is the most reliable method, the best way to avoid surgery is to prevent perianal fistula. To prevent it, pay attention to all perianal abscesses (commonly known as boils) and use appropriate surgery to drain the pus. Anal fissures and internal and external hemorrhoids should be treated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Burns and Scalds</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The weather is unpredictable and people have unexpected disasters." Burns and scalds can happen to oneself unexpectedly. Burns and scalds that affect large areas are not minor injuries, they are very painful and very dangerous injuries. The pain of burns and scalds is more intense than any other kind of severe pain because the nerve receptors (i.e., pain receptors) in the burned area are exposed. Whether the air is hot, cold, dry, or humid, or in contact with chemicals or any object, it will stimulate these receptors, and the sensation is constantly transmitted to the brain, so the injured person always feels pain. Conversely, pain is caused by the stimulation of exposed nerve receptors. If there is no stimulation, there may be no pain. Note that in addition to pain relief, large burns and scalds are directly life-threatening. On average, burns and scalds that account for more than half of the total skin area are often more dangerous than safe. The causes of death from burns and scalds are as follows: suffocation from smoke during the fire. Sudden death due to fright and injury after the injury. Death within a few days after the injury is often due to blood poisoning. Later deaths are due to ulceration of the injured area or internal complications. The final deaths are due to physical exhaustion or other diseases that occur at the same time. The consequences of burns and scalds in children are often more serious than in adults.</p>
<p>There are two main goals in treating burns and scalds. The first is pain relief. This kind of pain should really be relieved. Pain relief should be done using physiological methods. Pain relief should not endanger life. It should be known that improper pain relief methods can be very life-threatening. The second is to ensure life safety. Pain relief is a humanitarian concern, and ensuring life safety is the greatest purpose of treatment. Using the latest scientific medical methods can bring people back from the dead.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (59)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 5: Respiratory Organs Outside the Lungs - Laryngeal Tuberculosis (Continued)</p>
<p>Speaking of how to treat laryngeal tuberculosis, it is also a long story. The first step, of course, is the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis itself! The details of this aspect will be described in a separate chapter later, so let's not talk about it for now. However, there is one thing that must be paid special attention to in laryngeal tuberculosis, that is, the patient must absolutely prohibit talking. If the patient cannot do this due to habit, or does not do it completely, the loss to the patient is very significant. The author dares to boldly say that the more the patient follows the doctor's instructions without any deviation, the greater the hope for prognosis. This matter seems ordinary, but it is actually of great significance, and I hope readers will remember it well! If the patient really has something important that must be discussed face-to-face, it is best to use a pen to replace words. This requires the patient to develop a habit!</p>
<p>Currently, the use of metal preparations to treat pulmonary tuberculosis has long attracted the attention of the medical community! In fact, in reality, it has indeed achieved many results in laryngeal tuberculosis, which are worthy of attention. Its usage is no different from that for pulmonary tuberculosis. As for whether the treated person is suitable for this preparation and the pros and cons of this agent, all these situations are listed in detail in the "Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis" chapter. Injections of Tebagen also have considerable success.</p>
<p>For local drug treatment, a 5-10% menthol oil solution can be injected into the larynx. It has the effects of inhibiting decay, relieving pain, and stopping stimulation. For the ulcerated part, it is best to use lactic acid cauterization. The concentration of this ingredient can be gradually increased, and finally it can be increased to about 80%. Before applying this solution, it is best to anesthetize the affected area with a cocaine solution. However, both of these treatment procedures must be carried out under the supervision of a specialist using a laryngoscope. Especially with lactic acid solution, if the cauterization is too severe and it is applied elsewhere, the result will be damage to the mucous membrane, which will not help the disease at all. For those who have excessive difficulty swallowing due to severe pain, cocaine and other solutions can be applied externally. Food should be porridge-like and cold; excessively thin liquids and warm food are not suitable. In addition, artificial sunlamps and radium application methods, as well as electrocautery, also have visible success for local diseases.</p>

<h3>On Imagination</h3>
<p>— Lin Zhiying</p>
<p>If we delve into classical realistic works, in reality, those works often have a rich, strong, beautiful, and fresh "imagination" or "fantasy" force. For example, Gogol's "May Night," Pushkin's "The Queen of Spades," Gorky's "Mother"... These works belong to realism, but the content is permeated with healthy elements of imagination. The "ghost" in "May Night" and "The Queen of Spades," as well as the structure of "Mother," all come from the author's healthy and strong imagination (Fantasy). These works have captured the core of reality and shine with brilliant light in the literary history of the world!</p>
<p>Why is this?</p>
<p>The original art is to summarize and synthesize reality, but the artist is not like an accountant, who gathers all the daily trivial matters together and then calculates a total account. The artist (forgive me for saying it boldly) is the vanguard of mankind in understanding reality and changing reality! Look at the great writers in literary history, they are consciously or unconsciously the discoverers and expressers of new development factors in historical reality. The invention of scientific learning is the discovery of new development factors in scientific laws. That is to say, his invention is not created from "nothing," but is based on correct, rigorous, and sharp reasoning. The laws of the movement of matter are constantly developing, and rigorous scientists will discover new results in this process of development. Artists are the same, they inspect reality and study reality, so they discover new elements in the development of reality, and thus create various prototypes. Due to the writer's attitude towards the new elements of reality that he has discovered, he creates various prototypes of decline, wavering, and progress. It is very clear here that his worldview plays a huge role, but it is also very clear that he does not create various prototypes from an empty "subjective."</p>
<p>Take the most "imaginary" work as an example. For example, "News from Nowhere," a Utopian novel written by William Morris, a writer of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in England at the end of the 19th century. This is a novel that uses a strong imagination to write about the situation of a happy ideal society in the future. But this is not Morris casually depicted based on his own subjectivity. It was the British society at that time that presented the evils of private property, money, and machinery. In other words, the social conditions at that time made the aesthetician Morris dissatisfied with reality, so he wrote an imaginary society without currency and machinery, directed at private property, money, and machinery. However, under the limitations of his worldview, Morris's imagination could not be healthily developed. For example, his denial of machinery and industry and his imagination of the future society as a picture of the classical handicraft world is his lack of understanding.</p>
<p>From the above description, we can draw two important conclusions: First, since literature and art focus on creation and "invention," then the so-called "imagination" or "fantasy" Fantasy is indispensable in this creative process. If we want to avoid misunderstanding of the meaning of the word, we can say that "imagination" or "fantasy" is "imagination". Imagination is an important element or means of art. Second, the so-called imagination should not be an empty "subjective" concept, but should be coordinated with the laws of realistic development. It cannot be like Morris, letting the lower half of his imagination fall into his own subjectivity and betraying the development of history: it should be like Gorky, letting his own subjectivity coincide with the objective historical development, and produce healthy imagination.</p>
<p>How can we make our imagination healthy? This depends on the writer's life practice to temper. We know that this kind of established worldview is not easily changed. The development of this worldview depends on three main factors: (1) one's own life, (2) theoretical research, (3) creative practice. Gorky's rich life experience, profound research, and careful writing are the best examples for writers who now hope to move forward. If young art apprentices can work hard in these three aspects, then the imagination cannot but be healthy, because in this process, the worldview of serious people will gradually embark on the correct path.</p>
<p>The naturalistic realists of the past also attached great importance to the experience of life. W.M.Thackeray described one of these people saying "He patrols every corner of London, observing the coal miners and banks of taverns, and the drunken people in the streets of the suburbs. He peeks at everything, as long as he can collect materials for his work, he will not hesitate to clink glasses with pickpockets." Emile Zola, in his "Experimental Novel," also opposed "novels of pure fiction and pure imagination" and advocated "experimental novels." He did not know that "the art that rushes towards the truth" cannot stop at the phenomenon, but needs a correct imagination to help it. Moreover, Zola's own works have never completely left imagination, but imagination does not occupy an important position in his art.</p>
<p>The development of healthy imagination results in the formation of healthy romanticism. This is the only important factor in improving the reflection of reality and its social effects of art. We should work hard for healthy imagination and for new literature!</p>
<h3>A Couple Upstairs</h3>

<h3>Scenes from Dingle Street</h3>
<p>— Feier</p>
<p>Impressions of Singapore, Part 2</p>
<p>All day long, the eardrums are vibrated by the roaring sound of trains. The vampires of Malaya set up the atria and ventricles of their dynamic veins here in the morning. All day long, the arteries of the train transport fresh blood that nourishes the entire Malaya: goods, food, and coolies, while the veins carry back the raw materials sucked in. All day long, the chimneys spew out black smoke, and the sharp sound of the whistle awakens the dreams of the colony's children.</p>
<p>In addition, Dingle Street maintains its tranquility. There are few pedestrians under the scorching sun; the trams make a secluded sound.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I am trapped in a building upstairs in the deep night, listening lonely to the clanging bells from the Kirani church on Dingle Street. When the strong wind blows, the big trees behind the house sway their dark shadows, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>The flags that indicate sea navigation rise and fall forever on Royal Hill in front, and occasionally one or two small figures can be seen in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Adjacent to it is the Governor's Office. At dusk, one can see the Imperial Volunteer Army, composed of various people, returning from drill. The neat sound of leather shoes hitting the asphalt road and the majestic and demonstrative tones of the military music resound.</p>
<p>The nearby streets are full of residences. The houses on the small hill cast a huge shadow of trees in the dark night, and in the moonlight, the green grass beside the path reflects silver-white dewdrops.</p>
<p>It was not until the "Great Sen Festival" that Dingle Street was crowded with all kinds of people. The procession of the gods shook the entire Singapore, and the Kiranis seemed to be recognized by people.</p>
<p>The evening wind is cold and cool; the wind from the Indian Ocean blows. The area around the "Kirling Temple" is full of the bare-armed coolies of the Kiranis, the merchants' steps; Malay women sell bananas and cigarettes, and Malays shout to sell small beans with a small basket on their heads.</p>
<p>Dingle Street is forever a painting of still life: when lonely, one can comprehend the painting's feelings and poetic meaning, and when lively, it is just a picture of a small human disturbance.</p>

<p>— Xin Zhuojia</p>
<p>My long novel is about to be published, and I am very happy. I originally wanted to run out and tell my many friends, asking them to congratulate me; but suddenly it started raining heavily, and without rain gear, I had to stay confined in my attic room like a chicken in a coop.</p>
<p>My mind wouldn't let me be quiet for a moment; I kept thinking about what kind of praise and criticism my book would receive after it was published. I leaned against the window, smoking a cigarette, my eyes fixed on the countless rain streaks, my heart uneasy and frequently agitated.</p>
<p>I have always disliked, looked down upon, and yet somewhat feared critics. They almost never know the difficulty of creation for writers, and the profound meaning of the themes in their works. It can even be said that they understand nothing. They read your work like flies buzzing around food, regardless of whether it is fragrant or smelly. Before they even taste the food, they start buzzing and humming from afar, proudly telling people, "This is my most accurate criticism of this work!"</p>
<p>I know very well that my long novel will not please the critics. They will definitely not see the profound meaning hidden within the work, they will definitely be impatient and unable to continue reading from the beginning, they will never know where the brilliant parts of my work are. Moreover, my name is unfamiliar to them. Of course... definitely. However, I am not too worried, the main thing is the readers.</p>
<p>I have quite a bit of confidence in the readers. But when I occasionally change my mind, thinking that readers sometimes blindly follow critics, believing in their rumors and slanders, I become a little uneasy again.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"The general cultural level in China is indeed still too low!" I sighed deeply.</p>
<p>The wind and rain outside grew even stronger. I threw away the half-smoked cigarette and started pacing back and forth in the room. I tried my best to discard these bad thoughts and think positively. With such a good, great work, perhaps a new, great critic will emerge immediately. Of course, my work is not difficult to read; as long as someone has a little bit of foundation in literary theory and a little bit of patience to read great works, they are qualified to read my work. At that time, his criticism will surely become famous because of my work; and I will be able to obtain the position I deserve in the literary world.</p>
<p>Thinking this way, my heart slowly calmed down again. I longed for one or two friends to run in from the rain to visit me, chat, and discuss how to promote and introduce the book after its publication.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my door rang. Before I could turn around, I saw a clerk from the bookstore, soaked to the bone like a drowned ghost, burst into my room, smiling respectfully and cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Sir, it's done!"</p>
<p>"Did you bring the royalty payment?" I asked quickly.</p>
<p>"No, sir. The royalty payment has to be collected from the manager after publication. I came to ask you for an advertisement."</p>
<p>"Advertisement?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Whose advertisement?"</p>
<p>"It's for your long novel, sir." As he spoke, he shook the water droplets off his raincoat and sat down, telling me that because their advertising director couldn't understand or finish reading my long novel, he asked him to find me to write an advertisement for my own novel.</p>
<p>I couldn't help but get angry:</p>
<p>"He can't understand my novel?"</p>
<p>"No, sir. He can't understand anyone's books, and he can't finish reading anyone's books. And he doesn't have time to read them all."</p>
<p>"Then what about other people's books?"</p>
<p>"Most of them are written by the other gentlemen themselves."</p>
<p>I looked up and thought for a moment, feeling uncomfortable: "So that's how it is..." But suddenly, another unspeakable secret welled up in my heart.</p>
<p>"Won't people laugh at that?"</p>
<p>"No, it doesn't matter; sir, people don't know about this."</p>
<p>I asked him to sit by my bed and wait. I picked up a pen and first drew a sketch of the advertisement on paper. Then, many comments about my own work that I wanted to say but was afraid others wouldn't say or wouldn't say well surged up like a tide. Critics, readers, friends... all were washed away from my mind without a trace. It seemed that as long as someone could see my advertisement, there was nothing to worry about. I wrote:</p>
<p>"This is a great long novel written by a young writer on an empty stomach, spending three and a half years of arduous time. It has the unsurpassed talent of 'War and Peace', the refined writing style of 'The Iron Flood', the boiling passion of 'Cement', the liveliness of 'Hiroski' and the satire of 'Twelve Chairs'... There is a reason why the author leaps to the highest peak of the world literary scene because of this... Exquisitely printed, low priced... If you don't hurry and take the opportunity to buy a copy, you will definitely regret it and commit suicide in the future..."</p>

<p>It seems like crying, but no tears come out,</p>
<p>It seems like laughing, but the brow doesn't open,</p>
<p>Can't see where the sorrow is,</p>
<p>So deep, green and bottomless,</p>

<p>A faint melody in the ethereal, open your eyes,</p>
<p>Staring at the vaguely</p>
<p>Distant horizon in the black wilderness:</p>
<p>Quietly listening to the melody singing out my own cold and desolate life,</p>
<p>Counting the traces left behind,</p>
<p>It's like someone else's story, although</p>
<p>I'm a little sad, I haven't let go</p>
<p>Looking ahead—</p>
<p>Tigers and wolves lie across the thorns,</p>
<p>The sorrowful wrinkles immediately melt into a bitter smile,</p>
<p>The throat stiffens and trembles slightly,</p>
<p>Take a look—at the faintly</p>

<p>Raise a hand to the chest,</p>

<h3>College Days (10)(8)</h3>
<p>— By German Author Tomo, Translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>At this time, I unconsciously walked closer, straight to the barbed wire surrounding it. Sitting on the brown horse was my friend Christopher's sister. But there was another girl riding a horse, a pretty face; she sat lazily askew on a startled horse. Now she slowly turned closer, she turned her head and looked around with a smile. This was Nali; I was shocked, and my limbs began to tremble, she also recognized me; but her eyes looked at my eyes in confusion, for only a second; then she bent her body to the side, pretending to adjust her clothes. Her little fist held the heavy forged sword, seemingly unintentionally, because the sword was full of iron rings, almost up to the hilt.</p>
<p>At this time, the wooden horse carousel owner came in, he came to collect the money for the next ride. She stood up and showed him the forged sword. "I'm a reserved seat!" she said, while turning the sword upside down, letting the iron rings fall into the owner's hand.</p>
<p>He nodded and went to the other seats, where many children were fighting for better seats. When my eyes turned from there back to Nali, Christopher's sister happened to be standing next to her, with her back to me, seemingly unaware that I was here too.</p>
<p>"Are you going back with me?" I heard her ask, "I must go home."</p>
<p>Nali did not answer immediately; her eyes flickered over to me with an uncertain gaze. I didn't dare to move at all; but my eyes answered her, my lips whispered "Stay!" so softly that I couldn't even hear myself.</p>
<p>"Speak!" the other urged her, "It's already past eight o'clock." Nali put her feet back into the stirrups, she had already taken them out; her eyes looked at me, and she replied, "I'm not going back yet, I have a reserved seat!" and added in a low voice, "My mother might be passing by here."</p>
<p>I felt that this was a lie.</p>

<h3>Lu Zhengxiang</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Chinese military and political figures, whenever they step down, aside from those who are tired of military and political life and automatically retire to become wealthy idlers, and those who retreat to advance, temporarily going abroad to wait for a comeback, there are also many who convert to religion to spend their days chanting scriptures and praying. The former two types are numerous, too many to count. The latter type, such as Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang, were disciples of Buddhism, while Lu Zhengxiang was a believer in Christianity. These three people once held great power in the country and were prominent for a time, but now they have all become devout believers in religion. Among them, Lu Zhengxiang is the most famous. According to a report on the 29th, Lu Zhengxiang was ordained as a Catholic priest at the Church of Saint Andrew near Bo Chengqi City in Belgium today, with the religious name Peter Celestine. The church displayed the papal flag and the Chinese-Belgian flag, and no less than a thousand people from all directions went to observe the ceremony. The Pope also sent a congratulatory message to Lu.</p>
<p>In 1912, Lu Zhengxiang served as the Prime Minister of the former Beijing government. In 1927, after the death of his Belgian wife, he was overwhelmed with grief and resigned from his official position on October 4 of that year. With a solemn ceremony, he entered the Abbey of Saint Andrew in Belgium to become a Benedictine religious. Since then, he has devoted himself to Catholicism, living a monastic life. Time flies, and eight years have passed in the blink of an eye. Because of his usual devotion to monasticism, the church has now specially promoted him to the position of priest, which is a great honor.</p>
<p>When Lu Zhengxiang served as the Prime Minister of the Beijing government, his merits and demerits to the country are judged by the facts, so there is no need to discuss it. However, it is said that since Lu gave up his political career and went to the Catholic monastery in Belgium to practice monasticism, he has been very protective of his motherland, and he has not forgotten China because he is a religious believer in a foreign country. This point is very admirable. For example, during the September 18 Incident in Northeast China, he was extremely indignant and immediately published many powerful statements, calling for help from European countries, which received much sympathy from various countries. Also, this time, after he was honorably appointed as a priest, immediately after the completion of the ceremony, he sent a telegram back to China, claiming that his first prayer was to pray for God to bless China. His patriotic enthusiasm is more than enough to awaken the people of the country. Lu Zhengxiang is a national of our country. Although he has now become a foreign priest, he has not forgotten his Chinese compatriots and the Chinese nation. I deeply hope that my fellow countrymen will not forget the nation of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>The sun lazily shone on the railing of the pavilion, and countless frightening shadows like water snakes rippled in the stinky creek. The boss subconsciously raised his eyes, damaged by soot, squinting into a line like a cat at noon, looking at the dressing mirror opposite the stairs. The mirror reflected his own short figure; there was no sound on the stairs either. The clock, as old as the pavilion, happened to strike two at this time, and the boss felt as if he had been hit twice in the chest with an iron hammer.</p>
<p>The plum rain continued for three or four days, and no one came to the pavilion. The rain took away the boss's livelihood. He prayed, burned incense, and kowtowed countless times. Sure enough, it cleared up today. Early in the morning, the sun peeked into the window, and a smile spread across the boss's wrinkled face. He scrambled up from the ground, and like a monkey, rolled up the bedding and ran to the stove, raising his iron chopsticks to clear the coal ash, his arms full of energy!</p>
<p>Skillfully laying a layer of wood chips on the stove, striking a match, fanning the bellows, adding coal, the snake-tongue-like flames almost licked the boss's eyebrows. Drawing water, filling the copper pot, placing it on the stove, and then turning around to sweep the floor. There was nothing on the floor, no one had come to chew melon seeds for days, so he put down the broom and picked up a rag. The tabletop was thinly covered with a layer of dust, and a big-bellied spider had spun a web in the middle of the table legs. Damn it, you're here to bully people too, he thought, and with a wave of the rag, the boss claimed victory, and his wrinkled face turned into a triumphant smile.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>A big pancake, unable to distinguish between the nose and eyes.</p>
<p>Sitting down, he remembered that he hadn't washed his face. The long neck of the copper pot was already spewing thick white smoke. Grasping the eye sockets with his fingers, a pile of gunk had formed at the corners of his eyes, he hadn't lit the stove or washed his face for two days. As if someone had given him this bad idea, the boss was washing his face with boiling water for the first time, even using soap. This isn't wasteful, he comforted himself, washing away this pile of bad luck!</p>
<p>The color of the copper basin had changed, as black as in the stinky creek. Whoosh—to hell with it, bad luck! The boss's face stretched, not in anger.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard footsteps or something sounding, the boss pricked up his ears, like a donkey, his cat eyes naturally fixed on the dressing mirror. After a long while, the boss didn't dare to blink his almost aching eyes, there was no shadow in the mirror, his own short figure, he recognized it. Just kidding? Tiptoeing to the top of the stairs, he suddenly straightened up, the downstairs was a sea of darkness, the door hadn't opened! Hitting his head, like a rubber ball hitting the keyboard—thud! thud! thud! The boss rolled down the stairs.</p>
<p>Groping for the door brace in the darkness, oily and slippery, like touching a snake, the boss jumped up, as tall as an ordinary person! Stepping back two steps, turning sideways, using the sunlight shining down from below, like a doctor examining germs under a microscope: from the top end to the bottom end of the door brace, from the side to the center! Nothing there? Reaching out again, oily and slippery, a layer of tiny water droplets emerging on the surface of the door brace. Plum rain season, the wood is sweating. Opening the door, sunlight like an arrow, shot to the foot of the stairs, the boss's eyes blurred: someone there?—no, a tabby cat darted in.</p>
<p>The stone bridge beams across the street shone. Near and far, there was a sun in every puddle. A pomegranate tree bloomed with bright red flowers to welcome the boss hoping... a load of vegetables pressed on his head, full to the brim, that basket was as tall as the boss, climbing onto the bridge beams, Old Five Brother's body was like a boiled shrimp, his head could touch his toes.</p>
<p>—Old Five Brother, haven't been to the market for a few days?</p>
<p>Old Five Brother didn't stop, the weight of the two baskets of vegetables prevented him from stopping.</p>
<p>—Short-legged Wang, I'll send you a few vegetables back, haven't tasted oil for three days?</p>
<p>The laughter went over the bridge. Old winter melon, you'll be crushed to death and can't come back! The boss cursed in his heart and jumped upstairs; he still had work to do—the row of teapots on the shelf.</p>
<p>The copper pot on the stove, its long neck exhaling white air, as if cursing the old winter melon, evil has its reward! The boss thought, that guy must die halfway.</p>
<p>But that sound of footsteps or something rang out again, this time he understood; it was the clock on the wall. It was like an impoverished scholar, shaking its heavy pendulum: tick-tock! Wiped out, but quickly washing the teapot, today is a sunny day.</p>
<p>After eating lunch, the boss hadn't tasted oil for three days, boiling water with cold rice, his stomach was half full, he wanted to save the rest for tomorrow, although he predicted he would have fifty pots worth of business today.</p>
<p>So he looked at the dressing mirror at the top of the stairs, looked at the bridge beams under the pavilion. The sun ran really fast, it had already touched the railing, the dandy clock, was running frantically as if it had eaten its fill, this was going to wear out my old short-legged Wang's life! The people in this town are all short-lived ghosts, they don't know how to enjoy life!</p>
<p>Curse as much as you want, no ghost will come to the door, the boss picked up the copper pot, poured the boiling water that cursed the old winter melon into the stove! Hiss, like this pavilion, its life is over!</p>
<p>Bad luck! Running into that short-lived ghost early in the morning! The boss looked at the coal balls with their rolling white eyes, he estimated that the cost of a day's food had been sacrificed invisibly!</p>
<h3>Anchoring at Yamen at Night</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>I love sailing at sea, the raging waves seem to reflect my life.</p>
<p>It is such a wandering life, I have run through prosperous cities, I have stepped through thorny mountains and forests. When I come down from the peak with a tired tune, inevitably, I get on a steamship or some small tugboat, floating across the green seawater, to find my beautiful shadow.</p>
<p>For my own desires, I boarded a not-so-large steamship bound for the South China Sea from the pier of a complex city. This sea voyage will pass through the raging waves of Yamen. This is a very famous place in history, it is popularly said that the seabed of Yamen is very deep. Looking at the shore from the sea surface of Yamen, you can see a cluster of green trees and steep rocks. A long, long time ago, Lu Xiufu of the late Southern Song Dynasty, carrying the emperor, sank in this terrible sea - now, I have another good opportunity to float across the raging waves of Yamen.</p>
<p>When the steamship had not yet floated out to sea, there were no waves, the calm, evening sun reflected loosely and wearily on the wide river surface, the rocks on both sides were agitated by slight waves, revealing a certain tone, the sea breeze floated across the treetops on the shore and revealed a whistle, followed by the chirping of some birds. These sounds heard at sea can always make me not feel the loneliness of the sea voyage. At this time, I leaned on the railing on the deck and looked out, waiting for the arrival of the night, the sea was all a dark scene that I could not see clearly, when the sparse little stars in the dark blue sky reflected the sea water, I lay in bed.</p>
<p>Because I was very tired! I quickly fell asleep.</p>
<p>I don't know what time it was, I was awakened by the impact of the giant waves and the tossing of the ship, I rubbed my tired eyes, staring at the people in the cabin, most of them were asleep, the pale yellow electric lights reflected the people's sleepy faces! The more I looked, the more terrible it was. So, I closed my eyes in fear, but my ears and head were very sensitive! I listened to the roaring sound of the steamship's engine. However, what I felt most afraid of was the huge waves tossing the ship up and down, I felt like I was hanging in the sky. A strong wind was blowing outside, wailing... sha... sha... it was a terrible struggle. In such a situation, everyone would feel scared!</p>
<p>After a while, I heard the sailors outside the deck shouting and running, followed by dropping anchor, and the steamship stopped, however, the wind and waves were still impacting the steamship, the ship was still tossing and tossing. All the passengers were awakened, they all opened their eyes and said:</p>
<p>"How terrible, these wind and waves are very rare. But why is the steamship anchored at Yamen?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid we can't pass, it seems like we can't sail again.</p>
<p>People shouted like this, and my head suddenly thought of Lu Xiufu of the Song Dynasty who only drove a small boat to this place, even if he did not commit suicide, he would be devoured by the giant waves. Thinking about it, I couldn't help but tremble. I had to close my eyes again and again, silently. However, because the giant waves kept tossing, I gradually felt that I couldn't bear it, and there was a feeling of restlessness in my chest, dizziness in my head... in fact, I rarely get "seasick" when sailing at sea. This time, it has to be regarded as an exception.</p>
<p>As if I had lost consciousness, I survived the terrifying night, and the wind and waves were a little smaller, I ran to the deck. Looking at the Yamen Mountain still shrouded in clouds and mist, looking at the sea surface with its rising and falling waves, at that time, the eastern sun beautifully reflected the sea surface, white gulls fluttered lazily, all the lovely sea views intoxicated me.</p>

<h3>"Goddess of Liberty" Works Scientifically</h3>
<p>Under scientific management, Diantong's work in various departments is progressing in a planned manner. The production work of the studio is also actively adopting scientific approaches. Director Situ Huimin's "Goddess of Liberty" took the lead in this trend. Here is a brief description of the situation:</p>
<p>Director: When dividing the scenes of "Goddess of Liberty," in addition to systematically arranging all the shots and creating a table of the timeline of the plot development, the position and angle of the camera were also circled on the design card first, to avoid being rushed and disorganized on the set.</p>
<p>Editing: Editing is an extremely important aspect of a film's perfection. Because it is necessary to wait for the film to be finished before it can be edited in order to facilitate the work, this inevitably requires working all day and all night. Haste makes waste. Situ Huimin divided the editing work into several stages, progressing with the progress of the production work. Now, 80% of the editing work has been completed.</p>
<h3>Jincheng Opens Air Conditioning Today and Selects Lianhua's "Autumn Fan and Bright Lamp"</h3>
<p>Beijing Road's Jincheng Grand Theater, in order to provide a comfortable summer movie-watching experience for all Shanghai citizens, has specially ordered the latest type of ammonia air conditioner from the world's most famous York Air Conditioning Manufacturing Plant and installed it in the theater. This machine is produced by the same company as those used in the Shanghai Nanjing Grand Theater, etc. It uses ammonia, which undergoes changes through an air compressor and an air purification machine, and then chemically reacts with water. The internal structure is extremely complex and magical. It uses 18,000 gallons of water per hour and purifies 30,000 cubic feet of air per minute. It can automatically adjust the air to keep the temperature in the entire theater moderate, without the drawback of being stuffy or cold. The entire machine and project cost tens of thousands of dollars. It has now been installed and will be open day and night starting today. The theater will also specially select and screen Lianhua's latest fully dubbed and singing blockbuster "Autumn Fan and Bright Lamp" at the same time. The film stars Li Lili, Diao Banhua, Jiang Junchao, Han Langen, and other stars. The plot twists and turns, and the dramatic power is overwhelming. The actors' excellent acting skills are especially commendable.</p>

One page titled "Striving for Success"—The New Spirit of the Young Film Industry, is a group photo of the reunited Diantong Unnamed Basketball Team. Half of the full page is a front view of the Goddess of Liberty, and the other half is a still from the "Mountain God." Another page features works by Diantong non-photographers, combining landscapes, portraits, and still lifes into one corner, which can be said to be unique.
