<h3 id="c5">標金投機之影響 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>在十底長期存放欵項結算之際。不虞標金驟現非常之漲風。半月以來。外匯奇昂。物價飛騰。投機居奇狂漲暴跌。宜乎社會震驚。人心皇皇。一般不明通貨膨脹之說者。以為是卽增發紙幣耳。於是有現金者咸思藏匿。有資財者莫不謂與其存積貨幣而受損。毌寗囤積貨物以居奇。標金匯票。需求更股。白銀乃不期而集中於洋商銀行劃頭加水高至七角歷四日不動中國方面在倫敦市塲賣出白銀。連續至十八天猶未停止。資金向安全區域移動。原無足異。然中國正患存銀不足。去冬有加徵平衡稅之舉。今年三季中白銀雖入超七百餘萬。但黃金出超有一千三百餘。萬猶是出多入少。得不償失。</p>
<p>自標金用關金結價。咸知外商換縱不易。然近來金價仍無日不漲。當局出而維持。收效亦微。於是金匯兌本位制將實行。關金券將發行之謠言。愈傳愈盛。明知其說似是而實非。貨幣改革。自有其步驟準備。决不能咄嗟立致。但在一般人以為無有力之糾正。亦姑妄聽之最可慮者。以金價之上漲不已。正當交易。咸存戒心。如絲經等近日轉少成交。皆為此故。若一旦知所傳之非眞。反動之來。其勢又不可遏。此兩重損失。均投機家之所賜也。</p>
<p>吾人為大局計。有不能已於言者。（一）在商業金融疲敝不堪之今日。投機混亂之局面不可久。坐視不知補救徒然造成更嚴重之局面。加速資金之逃避。故當局宜更作明確負責之表示。以安定人心為第一。（二）中國政治經濟情形之複雜。市塲組織之畸形。無論何種改革。宜避免為叢驅爵。為淵敺魚。然觀察以往。不無常為外人造機會。良可慨也。（三）信用自內移外。由來巳久。早年之信用外鈔。及最近願以巨量現銀。換得外國銀行一紙之匯票。可見中國人並非無信用貨幣之觀念。能善用之。焉知不可以成事。故應如何確立信甩制度。移轉對外之心理。獲得人民之信任。是亦當今切要之圖也。（四）世界金融尙難安定。幣價之調整綦難。雖美電傳來有中國貨幣將安定於關金兩元五角及美金兩角六分八之說。但以中國入超之鉅。貿易以外收入之微。及種種故障。終覺此為不易。（五）際此時事多艱。外患孔殷。改革之難。倍於平日。陰謀搗亂。於今為烈。則如何為我民族經濟留一綫之生機。此又貴乎有獨立不倚之精神。自力生存之意志也。</p>

<p>弁言</p>
<p>經濟制度為社會之重心，而經濟勢力又為促進社會進步之原動力，今日之世界，幾全為經濟勢力所籠罩，此問題一日不能解决，則一切錯綜雜亂之問題，皆無從下手。我國當前之經濟病象，如工業生產之落後，農業之崩潰，人民購買能力之低落等，痼病已深，險象畢露，至在西洋各國，若恐慌之深刻關稅之戰爭等，皆屬不易處理，且皆與我國有切身利害關係者。</p>
<p>現時中國正在需要經濟建設之時，故經濟學理及事實，為國人所决不可少之智識，本欄使命，卽在藉文字力量宣傳經濟智識分析現實，以引起讀者對於經濟事物之興趣及確切之認識，此為本欄之一個願望。</p>
<p>至本欄之範圍，大致不外：（一）各種某本經濟觀念之解釋，（二）現代經濟組織之說明，（三）特殊經濟問題之探討，（四）各地經濟狀况之調查，內容文字，求其淺顯與準確，材料求其新頴與完備。</p>
<p>希望熱心之讀者，能給與本欄公正之批評與指敎。</p>
<p>投資　吳德培</p>
<p>近年來世界經濟恐慌之急潮，衝入我國，工商業衰落，失業人數激增，市面蕭條，游資積滯，存入銀行，而銀行因信用基礎浮動，放欵不易，不得不設法轉入投資之途。私人與商業機關之積聚現金者，亦頓呈過剩現象，不得不相率研究投放，以圖應得之利益，近日來本埠因歐亞時局與幣制謠言關係，公債行市暴騰，買方胃口旺盛，此正投資界之大轉機也。</p>
<p>（一）投資之特性</p>
<p>投資者以剩餘之資金，放入生產之途徑，（The　Productive　Employment　of　Capital）俾得適當之利息，使原有本金發出「再生產」之效用也。其投資之標的，須為積極生產且合乎經濟之原則，，不然，以有用之資金投於不生產之事業，是棄資而非投資也。</p>
<p>故投資之特殊要件，以本金之安全為第一。穩健之投資家須先求血本之保藏安妥，决不能孜孜為利，斤斤計較　利之高低，祇圖目前之微利，不知價測將來之危險。投資界之風險，誠所難免，亦須未雨綢繆，設法减少。事先應隨時默察公司理財，金融情况，商塲變遷，銀行業務，證券交易所報吿，政事動態，凡此均與投放之資金，息息相關，投資者雖不必熟習此類專門之學程，但亦應稍知其極槪也。</p>
<p>（二）投資與投機</p>
<p>投資與投機（Speculation）之意義及方向，根本不同，今分析之如下：</p>
<p>（一）投資者常設法避免危險，故危險之程度可减至極小，投機者之謀得巨利，全在危險重大，庶可賣空買空，為所欲為。</p>
<p>（二）投資者希望收受正當之進欵（Income），不作額外非分之想；投機者惟望本金增值（Appreciation）多得餘利，（Profit）愈多愈妙，多多益善。</p>
<p>（三）投資之收益率較有規律，投機則多不定之收入。</p>
<p>（四）投資時買賣有價證券，大都以現貨出之，，立時銀貨兩訖，投機者喜於拋空，多購期貨。</p>
<p>（五）投資者之買賣行為全憑統計；投機者則不然。</p>
<p>（六）投資者可以精密分析市况，預料變動之發生，投機者則不重分析，惟恐其少變動。</p>
<p>（三）投資機緣之開展</p>
<p>世界各國，其國家無論新舊，商塲情况無論盛衰，投資者只須有相當資金準備妥貼，均可相機進行，推其原因，有如下述：</p>
<p>（一）人口之增加農村人民集中都市，幾成為各國之普遍現象，於是人類需要日增，原有之實業，急宜增進生產，擴大組織，新興企業又不啻雨後春筍，接踵而起，凡此均需鉅額之資本，以樹立其基礎。</p>
<p>（二）生活程度之增高社會愈進步，人類生活愈形豐富，消費品之種類日新月異，品質與數量與前逈異，製造者力謀適應潮流，尤非集資充實內容不可。</p>
<p>（三）新興國家之發展立國未久，百廢待舉，政治之組織逐漸完密，經濟事業非隨之進展不可，如殖民之開拓，農工商之建設，交通路綫之完成，礦產之採取，皆係投資者良好之機會。</p>
<p>（四）交通便利內河，內海，大洋，大陸，航空，電報，在地圖上之綫網愈密，一國進出口貿易之數量愈大，進口商出口商與金融機關來往漸密，收支頻繁。</p>
<p>（五）國際關係之密切　近代國家均知古代閉關自守之非計，莫不注意國際間貸借互助之方策，於是發行債券，分售之於外國市塲，或集合一國之資本，投放於他國之生產事業，國際間有無相通，盈虧互補，國際投資遂成為現代國際間之中心事業。</p>
<p>（六）商業統計之編製投資之成功全在精確完密之預測，舉凡商業盛衰之循環，銀根之鬆緊，有價證券市價之變易，均須依據或然律）Law　of　Probability）與平均率（Law　of　Average）以推及將來，如是則現在之資金投放，有所準循，不致投入歧途也。</p>
<p>投資者誠宜一生謹眞，細思默察，靜待良機，萬勿利令智，輕舉妄動，孤注一鄭，致</p>
<p>（四）上海證券市塲與投資</p>
<p>歐美各國，投資市塲交易種類較繁，投資者機會自多，但在我國，以前因公司組織之不健全，公司債之發行絕無僅有，公司股票與省市公債尙無一定市面，最近僅中國銀行股票一種，在上海蘿商證券交易所開拍，幸近來上海市商會工商業復興委員會議决「以承受公司債票方式代替廠基借欵，」為增加市塲籌碼三種方法之一，倘能見諸實施，則我國投資市塲始可稍事擴展也。</p>
<p>本埠證券市塲原有二個：一曰上海證券物品交易所，在四川路一號；一曰上海證券交易所，在漢口路四二二號，自民國二十二年六月起，前者專做物品交易，以證券賣買併合於後者，於是上海證券之投資，集中於上海證券交易所矣。</p>
<p>華商證券交易所每日債票庫券之進出分現貨交易及期貨交易二種。現貨須於成為交後翌日交割，又分為二類在翌日上午十二時以前成交易者謂之前市；在翌日下午五時以前，由交易所交於買方者謂之後市。定期交易如云「十月期」即須於十月月底交貨；「十一月期」即須於十一月底交貨；「十二月期」即須於十二月底交貨，此即所謂本月期，下月期再下月期，三種期貨是也。</p>
<p>（四）投資之危機</p>
<p>商情變幻，莫可預定，市價漲跌，瞬息萬變，忽而金貴銀賤，忽而銀貴金賤，幣值之高低亦無定，投資者即使能盡智竭慮，三思而行，有時亦難完全避免下列各種之危險：</p>
<p>（一）市價之危險證券或增或减，資金或多或少，雖有供需定律為之準繩，但政治上經濟上非常事變之來，其勢急驟，其態嚴重，往往使投資者難於應付，馴至失敗而後巳。</p>
<p>（二）商業機關信用之危險發行公司債或股票之公司，在「不景象」之呼聲中，往往週轉不靈，無法維持，為之經理者，初猶嚴守秘密，掩耳盜鈴，一旦宣吿破產，何異晴天霹靂，自害害人，投資者倘不能預知，而收集其所發行之證券，則不免為也魚之殃及矣。</p>
<p>（三）政治機關信用之危險公家財政量出為入，常致溢出預算，無法彌補，原定公債之抽籤還本辦法，或不能實行，市塲上之信用，遂一落千丈，雖於起復。</p>
<p>（四）人事之危險戰爭暴動等擾亂社會秩序之事作，可使證券交易所為之停拍，百業為之凋疲，市塲為之崩潰，投資云乎哉？安全云乎哉？</p>
<p>（五）天災之危險地震，洪水，颶風，火山噴發，旱災，在在均使投資界遭逢損失，無法抵抗。</p>
<p>有企業必有危險，銀行經理盡閒簽購證券期貨，每致午夜夢回，轉輾不寐，皆負責重大而險象環生之故也。</p>
<p>（五）投資危險之代價</p>
<p>投資界危險之存在，常道也，非變象也。惟其常有危險發生，故須常有相當之報酬，以補益其損失，以酬答其規避危險之勞心，論其損失，有如企業家之利潤，（Profit）論其勞心，有如勞動者之工資，但此項報酬不可太高，亦不可過低，須酌乎其中，以就平正安全之道。茲分析其成分如後：</p>
<p>（一）眞實之所得（True　Imcome）投資之利息不能低於眞實應有之所得，倘一無所得或收入過少，則投資家將　躕不前，猶豫不决，市塲上缺少資本，拆息更須增高。</p>
<p>（二）合理之利潤（Reasonable　Prcfit）投資之利息不必高於合理之利潤，因利用資本之商家，本身亦應有相當利潤，供給資本之投資者不能侵剝此數，否則商家畏利息之高峯，深恐勞而無功，亦將逡巡不前，如是則投資者即富有資本，亦少放出之機會，英雄無用武之地，個人之痛苦事小，社會現金滯積不動，其害於工商業者實非淺鮮。故事實上借欵者付與貸欵者之利金，定須較低於應得之利潤，而資本利息之高低，全視企業收益力（earning　Power）之大小以為準則。通常以年利五厘至一分二厘為良好之標準，而年息七厘或年息八厘為中庸合理之利率。投資者倘不計本金之安猶可，否則非常依此標準不可。是故我國自民國成立以來政府所發之內國公債除十一年八月所發之特種鹽餘庫券利率為月息二分，十年二月所發之特種菸酒庫券月息一分五厘，十二年九月所發之秋節支付庫券月息一分，同年五月之特種鹽餘庫券月息一分五厘，民國十三年四月所發之崇文門津浦貨捐特種庫券月息一分，民國十一年一月所發之特種鹽餘一四庫券月息一分五厘，其利率較高外，又除國民政府財政部十七年金融長期公債祇為年息二厘五毫特別低微外；此外各種公債與庫券之年息或月息均以六厘至八厘為利率也。</p>
<p>（六）合理化之投資</p>
<p>最近各國競相提倡合理化之政策，凡生產消費交易仆配等一切經濟行為，莫不有一定積極完善之正則。投資者依此原則，當注意下列各事項：</p>
<p>一，須投放資本於生產事業，其他一切不生產不經濟之事項，一時定利雖高，亦不應為其所動，冒昧投資，致貽將來之憂。</p>
<p>二，須注意用資者之管理經營方法，因經營一不得當，輕則利潤减低重則虧累甚至破產倒閉。</p>
<p>三，主要目的在獲得眞實與合理之所得，投資者不得要求高利。</p>
<p>四，用資之企業危險性不宜太大，投資者宜處處謹愼，毌蹈風險猛惡之機，要知危險發生，良好資本勢必盡付東流矣。</p>

<h3 id="c54">公民與法律（上） <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>（十月三十日及十月一日對全國民衆講）</p>
<p>立法院委員林彬</p>
<p>今天我講的題目，是公民與法律，這個題目可分好幾點來講，先講</p>
<p>（一）公民與人民的意義</p>
<p>國家是人類集合的團體。屬於這個團體的，是呌人民，就人民全體來講，亦可呌做國民。人民當中，有些對於國家的政事，沒有參與權，有些是有參與樣，這種參與政事的權，呌做參政權。參政權是公法上規定賦與人民的權，所以又呌做公權，享有公權的人民就是公民。可見公民亦是人民，不過比較別的人民，能够享受公樺罷了。</p>
<p>同是國家的人民，何以其中有這樣區別呢。這大概是因為人民當中，有不宜於參政的，不宜於管理國家的政事的。所以不許他有公權。各國法律，用意相同，對於不宜參政的人民，往往有消極的資格的限制。我們中國，亦巳定有明文。例如鄕鎭自治施行法第七條第二項規定，有下列情事之一者，不得有公民之權，（一）有反革命行為，經判决確定者。（二）貪官污吏土豪劣紳經判决確定者。（三）褫奪公權尙未復權者。（四）禁治產者。（五）吸用鴉片或其代用品者。人民旣有此等情事之一，自然不應該許其參與管理國家的事務。其他的人民，沒有這種情事的，可許其有公權。但亦必須經過一定的程序，例如鄕鎮自治施行法第七倏第一項規定，中華民國人民，無論男女，在本鄉鎮區域內，居住一年或有住所達二年以上，年滿二十歲，經宣誓登記後，為鄕鎭公民，有出席鄕民大會或鎭民大會，及行使選舉，罷免，創制，複决之權。照這項的規定，取得公民資格的人民尙須具備以下的要件。　須為中華民國的人民。（二）須在本鄕或本鎮居住一年以上或有住所達二年以上。（三）須年滿二十歲。（四）須巳舉行宣誓的典禮。（五）須經鄕鎭公所登記於公民名册．具備此等要件的人民，才是鄕公民或鎭公民，開鄉民大會或鎭民大會時，可以到會出席，可以行使選舉權，罷免權，創制權，複决權。此四種權，都是政權，就是孫中山先生發明的四權，人民對於地方一縣的事情，可以出席公民大會行使其四樣，對於中央全國的事情，亦可以出席國民大會或是國民代表大會行使其四權。這是所謂參政權的作用，祇有公民，才有此權，其他人民，依法不許享受。所以公民與人民是有區別的。不過就人數比例來講，因為有反革命行為等情事而不得為公民的，到底是極少數。雖然事實上不能盡有公民資格，而在全民政治的精神上着想，當然希望沒有一人不是公民。公民對於國家的法律，固然要深切認識。就是其他的人民，亦應當有同樣的認識。凡是公民與非公民，沒有分開來講的必要的時候，我就用人民二字概括來講，現在要講，</p>
<p>（二）國家為甚麽要有法律</p>
<p>為解答這個問題，先要分兩點來講。一是什麼呌國家。二是什麼呌法律。</p>
<p>國家是人類集合的團體，上面已經講過，這種團體與別的團體不同。第一，須有一定之人民，第一，須有一定之土地，第二，須有一定之主權，凡一定的人民，居住於一定的土地之內，在唯一的主權之下所結合的團體，才呌做國家。其人民的數額少者數萬，多者數萬萬。原不必有固定的限制。國家管領的土地，通稱為領土。領土是表示本國行使主權的區域。就積極講，對於領土內之一切人民，可以行使其權力，就消極講，可以禁止他國侵入領土，以逞其權威。至其對於人民，可以命令强制，同時對外又不受任何權力所支配，這是國樣的表現，所以人民，領土，主權，這三樣都是構成國家的要素。</p>
<p>具備要素可以稱　國家了，而國家所要達到之目的又是如何呢。從前主張個人自由主義的人，都以為國家的目的，專在維持個人之人格自由與財產，然因保護個人過於周到，生產資本集中於少數人之手，社事上因之發生不平等的現象。於是有人又說，國家的目的，應以全體人民的利益為主。不可偏重於個人利益之保護。現代的國家，大抵依此見解，所以國家的目的，可以分為四種。（一）維持國家之生存。為達此種目的起見，所有外交，國防，財政等事項，就應好好辦理。（二）維持國家之治安，為達此種目的起見，所有預防土匪竊盜，以及一切足以妨害治安之事項，就應好好辦理。（三）確定權利義務之界限。個人相互之間或是國家與個人之間，其權利義務關係，均須分明，以防爭執。（四）促進國家之文化。如敎育，衛生，救護，產業交通，運輸等等，關係人民利益，而非私人力量所能舉辦者，須由國家辦理，如果一個國家，能够本此四種目的為其活動的方針，調和階級衝突，以謀社會共同利益之發展，那末便是好的國家。如果是一階級對於另一階級的壓迫，而為少數人維持利益的工具，那木便是不合國家眞正的目的了，又何必有國家呢。</p>
<p>法律可以說是因為逹到國家的目的，而制定的。什麽是國家的目的，從前的人，與現在的人，見解不同。所以關於法律的本質見解亦不一致。從前主張天賦人權的人，以為法律是擁護個人權刊的規則。現在的人，以為法律不是保護個人，不是保護某一階級，而是維持社會全體人類利益的規則，此種說法，比較妥當。如苒具體一點講，國家為行使其權力，應有機關之組織，所調機關，可分兩種，一是意思機關，國家的意思，由該磯關决定，例如國會或國民代表大會等　關就是。一是執行機關，國家所已决定的意思，由該機關來執行。例如君主國的君主，共和國的大總統，以及其他行政機關，司法機關等就是。此等機關內的組織，以及權限如何，均用法律定之。‘如果沒有法律，國家機關的活動，就沒有什麽標準了。再就人民方面講，人民對於國家之權利義務，以及人民相互間之權利義務，關係非常複雜，亦須用法律來規定，如果沒有法律，人民的權利，是得不到保障，人民的義務，是沒有一定的範圍，那末，說是國家權力不能行使，社會秩序不能維持了。所以旣有國家，就不能無法律，沒有法律，國家的目的，就萬萬不能達到，由此可知法律的重要了。</p>
<p>法律的種類很多，巳有明文制定的，稱成文法，未有明文的稱不成文法。適用於國內的，稱國內法，滴用於國際的，稱國際法，規定解决事項之原則的，稱實體法。親定適用法律之程序的，稱程序法。都因翻察點不同，所以名稱亦不一致，此時不能細講，庇外還有公法與私法的名稱。公法私法區別的標準，學說不一，有注重於法律關係之當事人。凡法律的內容，係規定國家或公共團體與個人間之關係，該法律就是公法。凡法律的內容係規定個人相互間之關係，該法律就是私法。例如憲法，行政法，刑法，訴訟法等，規定國家對於個人之關係，所以皆為公法。例如民法，公司法，海商法，稟據法，保險法等，規定個人相互間之關係，所以皆為私法。又有注重於法律關係之性質，為公法私法區別之標準者，凡法律內容如係規定一方對於他方有權力服從的關係，便是公法，如係規定一方與他方為對等的關係，便是私法，這兩種不同的說法，祗可作為參考，因為時代到了現在，公法私法巳無絕對的區別，不過為研究便利起見，仍有所謂公法私法的名詞而巳。</p>
<p>憲法，在公法中，是佔最重要的地位。凡國家之存在，必有一定之人民，土地，與施政的機關，而施政的機關，須為國家而行使其統治權，所以國家領土的範圍如何，國家人民的種族如何，國家統治機關之組織及其職權如何，均用法律明文規定。此類法規，又稱為廣義的國法。其中規定大原則者，為憲法，規定細則者為行政法。然則憲法就是規定國家糾織及其活動圍範之原則的法規。憲法　有最强的效力，高出於普通法律之上，與憲法牴觸之法律，不能認為有效。憲法不便經於修改。從事修改的機關及程序，亦與普通法律逈然不同。這兩點乃是憲法的特徵。現代各國，都有憲法。我們中國現在有訓政時期約法，其實質就是憲法，訓政期滿，開始憲政的時候，應有五權憲法，此項五權憲法的草案，巳經立法院起草完畢，祗要國民黨全國代表大會通過，將來開國民大會時，即可提出通過。公布施行。</p>
<p>民法是在私法中，占最重要的地位。凡父母子女兄弟姊妹夫妻等親屬關係如何，組織事業團體成立法人之程序如何，各種債權與債務之關係如何，動產不動產上之權利狀態如何，遺產之繼承如何，以及何種行為可以取得權利，何種行為應該負擔義務等等問題，均在民法中有詳細的規定，商業方面如公司，票據，保險，海商，銀行，商標等等，亦巳另定單行法規，稱為特別民事法規。一切民事均可依照此等法規辦理，如有爭執，亦可依照此等法規以求解决，實在與社會家族的組織，公共利益的增進，男女平等的原則等，有密接重要的關係，各國多有民法，我們中國亦已由立法院制定民法一千二百二十五條，公布施行。</p>
<p>以上所講，是國家不能不有法律的情形，及法律分類的大概，以下再講：</p>
<p>（三）人民在法律上之地位，</p>
<p>人民在法律上之地位，從前與現在不同，、回想初民時代，人類為避免毒虫猛獸之類的侵害，為在森林　山之中獵取生活資料，不得不互相聚集，謀共同的生活，那時候的社會生活，就是所謂共同勞動，共同享有，沒有階級的區別，沒有貧富貴賤的不同。在這種自然生活狀態之下怎樣是平等，怎樣是不平等，常然不發生問題，後來社會漸漸發展，由狩獵畜牧生活，進而至於農業生活，於是社會上亦有階級的分化，而且成為此一階級壓迫別一階級，支配別一階級的關係，不平等的現象，亦遂顯然可見而居於被支配階級的人，因為知識簡單，猶以為此種階級支配的現象，是出於天然，當然如此的，所以對於不平等的現象，尙未感覺有何等的不滿意。後來社會更加進步，人類知識逐漸增高，對於不平等的社會現象，發生重大懷疑，以為這是支配階級之權力所造成的，於是人類平等之呼聲，自十七世紀以來，遂布滿於社會，當時一般自然派學者，如陸克，如盧梭等，且進而為人類平等權之研究，有所謂天賦平等之說，此種學說，影響於當時社會，確實不少，十八世紀之美國獨立，法國革命，均是打破不平等現象的先例，至於現代，一般國家的憲法中，都有所謂平等權之規定。我們中國，民國元年約法，對於人民平等之規定，其文字是「中華民國人民，一律平等，無種族階級宗敎之區別」，中華民國訓政時期約法，亦有種規定，其文字是「中華民國國民無男女種族宗敎階級之區別，在法律上一律平等。」最近立法院起草之中華民國憲法草案，關於平等權之條文，共有三條。一條是「中華民國人民在法律上一律平等。」一條是定「中華民國各民族，均為中華國族之構成分子一律平等。一又條是定「中華民國人民受敎育之機會，一律平等。」依照此等規定，凡是國民，不問其屬於那一種挨，皆為構成中華民國之分子，一律平等，這是種挨平等。不問其屬於有產階級或無產階級，應受同等之保護或懲罰，這是階級平等。不問其所信仰之宗敎若何，法律上予以同等之待遇，這是宗敎平等。又不問其為男為女，除因性的關係，天然差別以外，法律上待遇，亦復相同，這是男女平等。由比可知人民在法律上之地位乃是一律平等，凡是人民可享之權利，或應負之義務，不因性別，信仰，經濟狀况等不同，而有差異，至於何者為人民可享的權利，及何者為人民應盡的義務，法律上亦有規定，以下分別來講。（未完）</p>

<p>新聲社云、華絲國外貿易、受日絲傾銷歐美市場影響以致大減、絲價暴跌、絲商瀕於破產、今自秋季起、華絲外銷漸見起色、絲價狂漲、各地原料行將吿罄、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>外銷起色</p>
<p>華絲外銷、連年不振、B字等級絲已跌至每担國幣四百元以下、為歷來所罕見繅成之絲、勢必虧本、以致江浙各地絲廠曁經營之絲商、均無法維持、瀕於破產、以上海而言、一百十三家單雙宮絲廠、勉強維持開工約十分之一、自今年秋季起、歐美市場華絲突見活躍、駐滬各洋行均採辦華絲、以致絲價稍高、B字等級每担漲至國幣五百元左右、各絲廠亦紛紛開工、</p>
<p>絲價狂漲</p>
<p>華絲出口七八九十等月、逐漸增加、至十月止已恢復以前狀況、其價格亦隨之高漲、B字等級目前每担已漲全國幣八百四五十元、較前漲高一倍以上、亦為民國十九年後所未有、各地絲廠曁經營之絲商、均大獲盈餘、聞以無錫之永泰·上海之寶泰·等廠為最鉅、同時繭子及下腳均隨之高漲、開工絲廠突增至於雙宮絲之外銷亦漸旺、虹口天寶路之福綸恒雙宮廠、復將閘北柳營路之鴻綸雙宮廠承租開工、</p>
<p>原料缺乏</p>
<p>江浙各地農民、鑒于華絲外銷之衰落、以致絲價狂跌、繭子價格、每担跌至國幣二十元左右、每次育蠶、實無利可獲、不得已將桑地改植其他農產品、以致繭子產額大減、自今年秋季起、華絲外銷起色後、頗感原料缺乏、其資本較小之絲廠、無原料可繅而被迫停車者踵起、</p>

<p>海翊輪係新自國外購入、船身載量極大、雖船齡較老、而建築尚極堅固、前因招商局徇糖商鄭澤南等請求、在北海海口海防三埠、代儎貨運、故即與華商議定、將海翊輪開航上海至防班、兼乘旅客、惟途經汕頭香港、例須請領國際安全航行證書、無綫電證書等三紙、香港政府方許其載客進出、當開航之際、經過種種交涉、方始領到、中國海輪之國際航行安全證、除招商四新海輪外、唯此海翊耳、</p>
<p>覆驗不合格</p>
<p>詎海翊到港、港政府驗明安全證後、惟須覆驗、是否合於安全證上所列各條件、經港政府派驗船師到海翊輪勘驗、發覺該輪台甲上、衹有舢舨、而非救生艇、船上所備救命衣等亦覺不敷、他如台甲、、艙室等等、均不能與國際航行安全證符合、因此吹毛求疵、不許通融、結果認海翊為不合航行國際港岸、搭載旅客、衹可作為貨物船云、</p>
<p>重修需巨費</p>
<p>經此覆驗、港政府不允給發客牌、即不能行駛國外各海口、如須繼續航行、須行大修、且須遵港政府驗船師指示主張、必須在香港船廠修理、但按照港政府所定大修計畫、所需修理費、各項改造、至少需十萬元、刻下華商輪船公司、對此尚在斟酌中、</p>

<p>春秋兒童週刊準備救國實力  王志欽　　小朋友！你們可知道意阿兩國發生戰爭的事情麼？這次意阿戰爭的醞釀，意國是一個主動者，阿國是一個被動者，阿國的人民為保護祖國的疆土起見，均自願赴前綫去為國犧牲。抵抗敵人的侵略，阿國的小朋友，見父親掮着鎗去打敵人，他們就在帮同母親處理家務和照料弟妹的事情之外，即邀集了許多小朋友各掮着木製小型來福鎗，被告小軍人操練，以待年長投軍服役，帮助他們的父親攻打敵人，替祖國爭光雪恥。　　小朋友！我們的中國也危險非常啊，你們是中國的主人翁，負有救國救民的重任，今後的一切工作，全靠你們來繼續奮門。小朋友，強國先要強種，望你們趕快鍜鍊體格，準備將來為國爭光的實力罷。走路的樹葉  真　　敏兒把讀書剩下的時候，總是獨個兒到家園裏去散散步，吸些清新的空氣。　　一天，他和他的哥哥聰兒到家園裏去玩呀，他看見一片樹葉在柳樹的樹枝上走。　　「哥哥，你瞧，那片樹葉在走。」敏兒覺得很奇怪的對他哥哥說。　　「弟弟，不，樹葉是不會走路的。這是因為有一種昆蟲，叫做葉形蟲，它走起路來，一搖一擺，遠遠的看去，真像一片樹葉，你便以為它是一片樹葉了」。　　於是他倆越過去一看，敏兒才相信了。　　「咦！真像一征樹葉，它身上的顏色是綠的和樹枝很像。哥哥，你可能把它一生的歷史告訴我嗎？」　　「好，我把先生所講的告訴你：葉形蟲的卵，在地上往往堆積成一堆，要經過四個月到七個月長的時間，才能孵化出來。幼蟲初從卵裏孵出來，身上帶着鮮紅色，可是它不吃什麼東西。直到一星期後，才開始找東西吃也慢慢的變成棕黑色，又過三星期漸漸的變成綠色，於是雌的一直到死，不會再變顏色的了。它吃的東西大都是茶葉，但也有吃柳樹葉和栗樹葉的。它一生要脫六次皮，這樣的超長越大，越大越像一片樹葉，到老的時候，全身大約有四英寸長的光景，雄的比雌的小，身長不過二三英寸，它沒有雌的這樣像一片樹葉。有些雄的是黃色和綠色，但也有綠色而帶着藍色的，它成蟲後，壽命很短，祇有四五個星期。」　　「它也是防禦的方法，使敵人當它是一片樹葉，便得了一種天然的保護，從此可知大自然的保護生物，是多麼周密啊！可惜我們的中國自己保護不周密，連大自然也不肯保護我們！你瞧，連年的水災，旱災！」兒童寶庫  承明　　小朋友：你們如果將你爸爸媽媽所給的糖果錢，及種種零用費，應該節省下來，積成一筆儲蓄的款項，其數量雖然很少，只要日常節省起來，不難漸漸地積成多數，將這筆儲蓄的款項，假如存進銀行裏吧？其利息究屬有限，倒還不如存放在你們自己的生生不息的寶庫裏吧！什麼叫做寶庫呢？就是多買些有益的書籍來讀，以及報紙雜誌等刊物來看，因為書籍是灌輸智識的資料，報章是增進常識和明瞭世界大事的南針。你們除學校裏日常功課外，還要多讀小說和書報，努力自修，其進步的神速，竟有一日千里之槪。那末將來有了高尚的學問，能在社會上做一番偉大的事業，這不是取之不盡，用之不竭的寶庫嗎？　　而且年來書報的價格，也很便宜，譬如說：每天節省一角錢，一個月就可買三塊錢的書報了，一年就有三十六元的讀物，那麼三五年之後，非獨學問進步的成績可觀，而且存貯的書籍報章，各種齊備，好像小小的一所圖書館。如果有兄弟姊妹數人的話，各人貯藏的各種書報，更來的可觀了。這所小小的圖書館，的確是小朋友們，從少年到壯年，在社會上可能服務自立的發源地的一座寶庫啊！簡易的風車  希旦　　小朋友！今天又是星期日了，我們不妨試做一下吧！它的方法很簡便，只要有幾張紙條，和一根筷子，其餘的東西都用不着，便可做成一個很有趣的風車了。　　先用半寸闊四寸半長的紙條三條，再把這三張紙條，對摺好了。然後把它們互相插起來，最後再漸漸的收緊，便成功了。它的玩法也很簡便，只要用一根筷子橫着頂在它的後面跑，它便會轉得很快。你如果把它的上面，加了各種顏色，轉起來好像各種顏色渾在一起，非常有趣。你若不用筷子，也行，祇有手把風車翻個身，倒拿得很高，一放手它便會旋轉而落在地面上了。　　諸位小朋友！你留心看風車向那邊轉？這是什麼道理？你能另造一個風車向相反的方向旋轉嗎？遊戲畫  （程珍如）　　小朋友：上面一對臉，你看像一個哥哥和一位妹妹在說笑話嗎？每個臉，是用1234567890十個字組織成功的，好玩嗎？如以為好玩，那麼課餘的時間，不妨也可以這樣畫起來玩玩，無論蟲魚鳥獸…，都可以畫得，多麼有趣，還能够增長颕悟。小朋友贊成嗎？修理  天基　　更正　昨日春秋特刊「蟹」三字，誤為「蟹」特刊，特此訂正。彩虹  浪　　雨點淅瀝打在草地，好像一聲聲對孩子們說：　　「我阻止了你們的遊戲，真是十分對不起！」　　一會兒，雨過天霽，　　一條美麗的彩虹，湧現天際，　　孩子們很高興的說：　　「天呀，你真客氣，使我們看了多麼歡喜，謝謝你的美意。」兒童科學講座一本書  林蔭　　（一）排和印　　小朋友們！我們是多麼幸福啊？除了學校裏面讀的書籍以外，還有多少種的書報，供給我們閱讀應用。可是一想到印刷術沒有發明以前，用漆書，刀刻，手抄的書本，是多麼艱難的一事呢！　　印刷術真是傳播文化最好的方法。印刷廠裏的排字間裏，放着許多分成格子的架子。架子上排列着無數的鉛字，一個排字工人，一面讀着書的原稿，一面把鉛字從架上撮下來（圖一）熟練的工人，是非常迅速的。撮下來的鉛字，就盛在盤裏。撮齊以後，再按照行列排好，緊擠在一個框子中，表面上好像是一塊鉛板，實在是無數鉛字，符號，空白鉛條拼湊成的。　　第二步手續，就把拼湊成的鉛版，用黑墨打出樣子，給管理校對工作的人去校正，排字工人在迅速的撮字工作中，免不了有錯誤碼的地方，必須經過三四次的校對，才可以免掉字的錯誤。校對的人一面讀着原稿，一面校對排成鉛字的印樣，仔細地對照，如有錯誤的地方，便用筆摘出記號，叫排字的工作改正。（圖二）　　經過幾次校正以後，錯字沒有了，排列的式樣也對了。那就把這排成的印床放到機上去印刷。一個附着油墨的滾筒在這印床中鉛字上滾過以後，上面覆着一張白紙，然後重壓一下，這墨跡落到紙上，印刷便成功了。（圖三）如過要印第二面，那就須另外用第二塊鉛字印盤。這樣一張張印下去，蓋一張紙，加一次墨，無論要印多少張，都可以隨便印刷者的決定。　　在這印刷術沒有發明以前，如果用手來抄寫，那一本書的成功，不曉得要耗費多少的時日。我國從前把原稿刻在木板上，用木版來印刷，（圖四）也不曉得要化費多少時間哩！張巡故事  穡秋　　張巡是唐代的一位民族英雄，他死守睢陽，抗拒胡虜，雖然結果失敗，以身殉國，但比之一般棄地逃走的人，真是高風千古了。　　張巡是唐元宗開無末年的一個進士，雖是文人出身，武才也很不錯。當安祿山反叛的時候，他在雍邱地方六十多天，與賊兵大小三百餘戰，軍威因之大振。後將賊將令狐潮又統率大軍來圍攻。前後四十餘日，與進廷方面，聲聞完全隔絕。令狐潮與張巡，本屬朋友，因修書勸第巡投降，經第巡嚴辭拒絕了。這時張巡軍中，有六員大將，已經有投降之心，為張巡察知，便一齊殺死，於是士卒之心益堅，沒有一個敢再懷異志的。可是賊兵愈來愈眾覓，將後路截斷，於是他沒有辦法，只得退保寗陵，這時與睢陽太守許遠，才時常相見，終於二人合演出一幕歷史上有名的壯烈的悲劇來。　　唐肅宗至德二年，賊將尹子奇帶了十三萬人馬，來攻打睢陽，許遠便派人向張巡告急，張巡遂引兵入睢陽，可是與許遠的兵合起來，一共只有六千八百多人。但他并不因人數少而懼怕，仍舊鼓着勇氣，不分晝夜，督率了士兵擒賊將六千餘人，斬士卒二萬餘人，以極少數人，演出這樣驚人的成績，無怪要嚇得賊兵在半夜裏偷偷的逃走了。　　尹子奇第一次失敗了，心還不死，第二次又帶了大軍來攻，把一座睢陽城團團圍住，形勢十分吃緊，幸虧張巡那裏有個部將叫做南　雲，善於射箭，竟給他一箭射中尹子奇的左眼，於是尹子奇負創帶兵退去。　　那年秋天七月裏，尹子奇又徵兵好幾萬來圍，這時睢陽城中，兵士只餘一千多人，而且多半飢而且病，不堪戰門。到了後來，死傷之餘，只剩六百多人了。　　這時譙郡的許叔冀，臨淮的賀蘭進明，都擁有重兵，坐視不救，因此一座睢陽孤城，格旬一天色舅一天。但是城雖危急，張巡等抱着死守的決心，毫不懼怕。　　睢陽城被困即久，城中所有食物，漸漸吃盡，甚至鼠雀也羅掘俱窮，後來鼠雀也沒有了，張巡便把他的愛妻也釘聞，將伊的肉，分給兵士吃，這時，所餘的兵，一共只有四百人了。　　結果，睢陽城終於被賊兵打破，張巡雷萬春南霽雲等三十六人，皆被殺死，許遠也活捉了去。事雖失敗，但睢陽是江淮之保障，若沒有他們一番苦守，恐怕江淮一帶，全歸賊手，後來郭子儀等收復失地，還沒有這樣容易吧！介紹小先生聯盟會  巴玲　　我們承認：兒童的能力，是很偉大的。我國的普及教育，如果要達到一條成功的途徑。那末，除了負教育之責的教師們，應該切切實實的負起責任以外，全國的在校兒童，更要行施他們小先生的使命，努力幹去。才能使普及教育，得到成功，這是一般教育家所共同承認的公理。　　小先生的使命，即如重要，小先生的責任，即如此重大，那末，小先生們應該組織起來，來負擔這個偉大的使命吧？關於這一件事，成人們是應該予以帮助，使其實現的。現在我特地來介紹俞塘民教館的小先生聯盟會，希望各地教育機，也繼起組織，使小先生普遍各地，而完成普及教育的重大使命。俞塘開始工作以來，即努力兒童生活，同時認定小先生制為目前普及教育之經濟有效方法，活動數月，成效可觀，現已組織兒童自動普及教育團七處，於上星期日舉行小先生聯盟會成立大會，一　揮，劃齊步驟，是日到會兒童，共有百餘人，舉行宣誓典異，　　由當地黨政機關代表蒞臨監誓，情形頗為熱烈，宣誓完畢以後，一百餘小先生，就開始普及教育的工作。　　由於這一件事情上看來，可知我們要達到普及教育的目的，小先生制是萬萬不可不運用的，我很希望各地教育機關，在兒童年之中，多多推行小先生制的工作。翻身過河之游戲  紀一介　　法以三人為一組，先由甲乙兩人對面立定，甲的左手握住乙的右手，乙的左手握住甲的右手，然後丙用頭攢入甲乙兩人四臂之中，這時甲的左臂與乙的右臂，把丙的頭部用力向下壓，一方面甲的右臂與乙的左臂，同時把丙的腰部用力向上提，使丙的身體，不知不覺的就在這一壓一提之中，在空中翻過去了。如此輸流為之，即不需要何種設備，又可活潑身體，舒展筋骨，鍜鍊體魄，并且可以悟得偶力作用（附註）的巧妙，比拔河捉迷藏，更為便利，可說是小朋友們最有益的游戲。　　（附註）偶力作用，就是兩種用力的方向，各居相反的地位，而作用則一，且其結果，還能得到加倍的效能。小黑炭（音樂家）  徐蝶仙作白山烏的故事（八）  禧　　那斑鳩聽了我的這一句問話，便垂倒了頭，漲紅了臉，耳紅得像綠露姑娘的羅帶一樣，當下伊說道：「啊！先生，我自己也不知道。…」　　我急道：「小姐，瞧上天分上，請對我說！我是本意，并不要冒犯你，恰恰與此相反。在我瞧來，你們倆都是很可愛的，我只要一知道了我自己究竟是喜鵲呢或是別的東西，那我敢在這裏宣誓，把我的心和我的爪一一獻與你們，要是你們肯接受的話。」接着我又放低了聲音，悄悄地向那斑鳩姑娘說道：「當我最初瞧見你時，覺得我自己屬於斑鳩一類的東西，這使我心中很感痛苦。」　　那斑鳩的臉更漲得紅了，向着我說道：「我的話是真的，可是我不知道是不是為的那陽光的長照，恰照在你的身上，又被那罌栗花襯托了一下，我瞧你的羽毛，確是帶些紅噴噴的。…」以下伊就打住不說了。　　自從當初我因了歌唱，被父親驅逐出來之後，我就從來沒有試過我的歌喉。這時我就想利用了它以挑動這兩位姑娘的情感。於是我很謙下的鞠了鞠躬，開始的唱起歌來，先是低低弄舌，然後將聲音提高了一些，末了便提足了嗓子，朗朗的高唱起來，好像一個西班牙的驢去，在那裏齊唱的一般。　　我愈是唱得久，那小喜鵲愈是很詫意的離開了我。末後，更現出驚嚇和厭倦的神情。我仍還沒有覺得，把聲音都唱得嘶啞了。伊好容易打熬了二十五分鐘，實在對不下去，就張開了翅膀，飛將開去，回到伊的綠宮裏去了。至於那斑鳩呢？他早已肯德基熟在那裏。　　我暗暗的想道：「啊！這就給我試驗出來了。只有我的母親，愛聽我的歌唱。啊！我的母親，我是何等的想念你呀！」</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊海外通訊網匈牙利的收穫祭  夕　　——地主與農民同樂——　　布達佩斯通訊　　歐羅巴的收穫祭，是從古代希臘人之祭農業女神德美特開始的。德美特（Demeter）一字等於希臘語的格美特（Gemeter　ge——地，meter——母），卽「七之母」的意思；伊是希臘神話中的土地耕耘的女神，農業的守護神。據希臘神話所說，世界最初的穀物是德美特裁植的。女神德美特曾經向人類宣布：穀物的胚胎卽是我的姿態，看見它猶如看見我一樣，因而家庭和平亦會得到保障。伊的愛人托里普托列莫斯（亞太加的武將）曾以武力將其意旨擴張到全世界，使人類從事和平的耕種。人門對此所行的感謝的祭禮，是在每年秋的收穫期——在希臘是在十月舉行的。於是，德美特女神在希臘羅馬的文明世界中便成為了人類文化宣布之神，和平的專使，家庭生活的守護神，直到現在還被尊重着。　　匈牙利的收穫祭有兩度：一度是初夏的麥的收穫祭，另一度是中秋的豪華熟鬧的葡萄收穫祭。這兒的初夏的麥的收穫祭，也和繼承希臘羅馬文化的歐洲基督敎諸國的收穫祭一樣，是有幾分宗敎的嚴肅性的；但秋季的葡萄收穫祭却是　粹的匈牙利式的，匈牙利的所謂純朴純情的人情，風俗，習慣，都於此際赤裸裸地表現了出來，很是有趣。不過，近年來因為農業生產的現代化，戰後的經濟恐慌，這里的收穫祭也不如往時那麼地可觀了。　　在匈牙利流行着一句諺語：「小麥和葡萄酒一和平與美妙的女郎」，這便是匈牙利人一切願望之具體表現。他們平生都是在為特凱的酣的葡萄酒，為用太沙河平原的麥作成的美味的麵包和果子而奮鬥，為此他們忍受了一切苦痛難堪的生活。事實上，匈牙利的麵包和酒的滋味確是很好，許多人常說，只要嘗過一次匈牙利的美味的麵包和酒，一生都不會忘記的。據說這兒的麵包和酒所以有如此美味的，與太沙河的水有很密切的關係，匈牙利人常說：「飲太沙河之水，使人覺得如歸故里一樣。」　　大約是在四月的下旬，是匈牙利舉行麥穗洗禮儀式的時期。在舉行儀式這天，農民們都在牧師率領之下，走到這年所選的麥田中去，仰望着晴朗的天空，祈禱未來的豐收，希望新穗不為霜雹風旱所傷害。儀式完成後，農民們都各自在田中採一根麥穗回去，將其供奉在神龕上，希望未來的豐收。　　此間割麥的時期大槪是在六月二十八九日。這時麥的全身都是金黃色的，所以，和風吹過，匈牙利平原都好像在起伏着黃金的波籌樣。在割麥的時候，</p>
<p>Page 20</p>
<p>農民們雖然很忙，但他們卻很快活，他們彈着梵亞鈴，唱着快樂的歌；一到休息的時候青年男女們就都跳舞起來，非常快活。此種情形現在雖不能隨處見到，但在德蘭士弗尼亞等地方，還是有這種表現的。　　在割麥的時候，此間還有許多有趣的習慣。例如，在收獲期中，如果地主來到了田間，那割麥者中的美妙的少女就要馬上停止工作，用麥葉的繩將他縛起來；於是那少女即向地主要若干贖身的代金，不得到相當代價她是絕不把繩解開的。此種贖身金在過去是數十彭格，而今則是幾公斤的葡萄美酒。據說要這樣做麥子才不會從麥穗脫落下來。同時，在割取的時候，最初和最後的麥穗都是有重大的宗教意義的。最初被割的麥穗是要由象徵富饒的小孩來割，割了之後再把它架成十字，供奉天使，因而更把它當作滅除惡魔者來崇拜着。至於最後的那根麥穗，則是為老鼠和野鳥及惡魔留下的，此外窮人也可在此得到一點兒恩惠。有些地方的農民們把這留下的麥穗作成人形，飾着花，在其周圍跳舞。　　在匈牙利有些地方，當割麥的時期，我們還看到了這樣的奇事：農民們用割了的麥束作成花環，運到地主家里去；當此之時割麥者教歌舞着行走，婦女們都穿着白衣或別的華麗的衣裳，拿着花束同行。在德蘭士弗尼亞地方，農民們是把割了的麥束堆積在馬車上，再於車上用麥穗和野花作一個美好的大彩門，更找一個最美妙而又不怕冷水的處女站在其正中，於是才排成行列驅車到地主家里去。當他們走過各農家的門前時，人們即要用冷水撲車上的美女。這樣的收穫豐富。當這行列到了地主家下時，地主即要給與農民們一些贈品，農民們即獻給他這一類的詩：　　「收穫已經完了，　　深情的主人現在歡迎我們，　　我們趕緊跑來參與。　　我們必須獻馥郁的花環！　　我們用美好的庭花和野花，　　束成了可愛的麥穗的花環；　　為了主人我們把它携來了，　　為的參加主人的收穫感謝祭！　　神啊，請把永久的歲月之間，　　請給我們夫婦以永久的生活吧！　　我們夫婦如一對斑鳩一樣的和好！」　　在這樣的一番儀禮的應酬之後，盛大的饗宴和歌舞便開始了，他們要在晴空之下飲到天明。　　當葡萄的收穫期來臨時，匈牙利人當然也是很忙的，但是這時他們卻表現出無限的喜歡；他們忘去了一切的苦痛和憂愁，他們要任性地狂飲。在這兒有一句流行的諺語：「沒有酒和娛樂的葡萄收穫猶如沒有音樂的結婚式一樣」，由此當可想見匈牙利人在葡萄收穫期中的歡樂情形了。　　匈牙利的葡園是火山質的土壤，比世界任何地方都適宜於培植葡萄。這里出產的葡萄可以製成黃金色的那有名的葡萄美酒，據說飲了此酒之後，死人也能復生。此外還有幾種葡萄酒，亦是很名貴的。因此，匈牙利人非常寶貴他們此種出產，這寳在是他們遣散憂悶的萬靈藥。　　匈牙利人的結婚，多半是在葡萄收穫完結時舉行；他們祝賀人家的結婚禮物也離不了新麥的麺包和新的葡萄酒。這里有一首小歌：　　「最初看見赤的葡萄的處女，　　必然要在秋天結婚。」　　這便是匈牙利人結婚和葡萄的關係的表明，也就是他們寶貴葡萄的一種表現。　　在大的葡萄園的收穫完結時，也和割麥時一樣，匈牙利人也要歌唱，跳舞，狂歡，少女們也要穿白衣，飾着美麗的野花的花冠，參加這種歡樂的表演。業餘漫譚英美的覇權戰  居肖　　到底雖是領導世界的第一強國？這是世界上一爭帝國主義者間矛盾的原因，也就是英美兩國間永遠水火的問題。　　美國即然換着和平的幌子搖曳於世界政治舞臺之上，自然不可以公然提出世界再分割的口號。但牠卻很乖巧地又用「門戶開放的藥丸加上一層甜蜜的糖衣後與英法諸國作經濟勢力的角逐。所謂門戶開放，就是說凡已獨占的殖民地區域，美國　可以　　資本依平等的權利來加入侵略。牠這一個妙算實現之後，統治殖民地的政權即徒然成了空洞的形式，而美國資本的爪牙，賴其雄厚的實力，卻實　地佔領着經濟勢力的地位。　　加拿大就是最好的例子，形式上雖屬於英國，而經濟上則無異於美國。　　至於海上　　之王，自然應該屬於英國的，但關於海軍門爭，美國又何嘗不傾全力於這個問題？在和平謊語的掩飾之下，美國曾向英國說：「不管你是否同意於你的戰艦噸額不超過於我，假如一旦我們要開軍備競賽的時候，你怕無論如何跑不過我的。」那時英國正想得美國的帮助以穩定牠的金融，并且大家都不能冒輪去公開競爭建造戰艦，以白白糜費無數的金錢，故而兩國標準(Two　P　owers　Standard)　的原則便確這下來了。　　但英國雖忍氣吞聲，卻堅決不默爾而息的，牠的覇王地位決不肯輕易撒手讓人的。牠極力從事於軍用品的新發展，使大戰艦的價值較前大過一倍以上，又，小戰艦即并無限制，牠就盡其可能的維繫其海上霸權於不顧。日內瓦的海軍裁軍會議之無結果，實如水到渠成不可勉強的事。　　牠們在軍事上的角逐，是無時無刻不在鈎心門爭的。現就其形勢，觀察如下：美國除夏威夷群島外，甚少海軍根據地，故不得不需要大型的巡洋艦，才足以威脅作戰海船（戰時裝甲加砲的商船）。至於英國，因為牠有許多聯絡的海軍根據地，并不需要過人的大巡洋艦，而需要輕靈的戰艦來保護商業及控制商業航行。牠原有強大的　務艦隊中，隨時可選出好的船隻，加以武裝，使其成為大巡洋艦，這種準備在平時都早已預備着的。并且海員的訓練有素，英國遠超過美國之上。因此種種，即美國立刻大造戰艦，也決不能即時趕上的。　　嗣後英法的軍法協定實予美國以嚴重的示威意義，英法有組織的諒解合作使美國在訂造大軍艦的熱忱上大失所望。英法協定雖有人認為是英國投降法國的軍國主義，犧牲洛迦諾的和平政策，但魯易喬治則認為是戰後英國外交史上最榮幸的大事。　　目前英美間的矛盾更是一天嚴重一天，這從美國的造艦程序已這參院所同意一事可以證明，不消說，未來角逐的中心還是資本主義國家的霸權問題。雜作夜曲  鐘　　聖誕節，南國的聖誕節，懷着沈重的思鄕病的我，跟着同學老程，懶懶地踐踏着冬天的夕陽，終於直至一座灰色的小洋房的前面。推開圍墻的小門，聽行見裏面有瀏亮的鋼琴聲。客廳裏裝飾得很整潔，稍微帶着法蘭西柔和的風味。在玻璃窗前，一個十七八歲的女孩子正在按琴，穿着青色的旗袍，頭髪比炭還要黑，這是老程的妹子明珠。　　聽見了男性粗暴的腳步聲，像貓一般敏捷地轉過頭來。蒼白的橄欖形的臉孔，憂思的眼睛，兩隻纖細的手還是在彈着蕭邦的「夜曲」，沈鬱凄涼的琴音飛出敞開的小窗，溜進薄暗的聖誕節的晚空。老程告訴我過，她是最近失了戀的。　　我望着她那憂思的疲倦的，然而恬靜的眼睛—眼睛的深淵裏是青年們所不能了解的神秘，我們倆就這樣地認識了。在她看來，我或許祇是一個很平凡的青年，然而在我看來，她是有多麼驚人的迷力啊！　　第二天，我跑遍了全城的書店，為要找一張美麗的，有意義的賀年片送給她，找了半天，才找到一張較為滿意的，接着又親身跑到郵政局去寄，回來的時候才覺得自己輕鬆了不少，心上沒有什麼鉛塊似的東西重壓着了，然而覺得輕鬆的時候并不長久，因為我又在担心着她的回信了。有好幾次，我瞞着朋友們，獨自個在她家附近兜圈子，心中又怕又急，腳步總是不自然地快了起來。有時候有琴聲，很盼望她會從飄揚着的白窗帘後伸出頭來；有時候連琴聲都沒有，隨即又担心她是在生病還是什麼…。　　那一年最後底一天，一個濛霧的冬晨，我終於從老郵差的手裏接到了一封淡青色的信，信封上是女性清秀的小字，我覺得心臟好像是要跳到喉嚨口似的，瞞着同學們，獨自一人向飄着落葉的小徑上跑去，瞎跑了半天，終於揀了一個很幽靜的地方坐了下來。　　她底賀年片是一張風景畫，有點脂粉香味，我注視着那些斜斜的，女性的，藍墨水的小字，我覺得自己是世界上最幸福的人了。賀片上是北歐冬晚落日的風景，街上橋上屋頂上樹枝上都堆積着白雪，石橋帝是一間古舊的小教堂，教堂的窗口露着輝煌的燈光，教堂後是赤紅色的晚霞。這張畫的色調異常沈鬱，很容易使人家體味着人生底疲倦，一個十七八歲藥一般的少女，真不應該用這樣沈鬱風景畫送給她的男友吧！然而，那時候，我還是覺得異常快活。　　以後，我還到她家裏去過兩趟，大家混得熟了一點，講起話來也自然一些了。那年寒假，我回到故鄕，經過了幾夜的失眠，才鼓起勇氣來寫第一封信給她，一星期後她覆了一封短短的信，雖則是那麼短短的一封信，卻挑動了我無限的情思，於是第二封信，第三封信…。　　春，學校內開學了，我像箭一般趕回S埠去。一到S埠，將行李讬同學照料，又是獨自個雇了車子到她家裏去。這時是閩南的初春，處處都充溢着溫柔的春意，街樹青翠的枝梢，孩子的笑聲，春陽的影子，新的店窗，都使我覺得彷彿是在夏夜美麗的夢中一般。　　下了車子，用發抖的手輕輕敲着她家的門，出來開門的是她那七八歲的小弟弟，睜着黑溜溜的眼睛，頑皮地搖着頭，我不懂他是什麼的意思。客廳裏燃着一種奇異的香木，青色的淡煙，一圈一圈地飛出　潔的玻璃窗。一個婦人的頭從書房那邊伸了出來，那是她的母親，接着是辣椒一般的苦笑，她說老程沒在家，說話的聲音有點嗚咽。於是我忽然覺得客廳是比從前空虛多了，玻璃窗前還是那張黑色的鋼琴，琴蓋上蒙着一層灰塵。　　她是在兩天前患着急性肺炎逝世的。她，一朶憔悴了的花，生對於她并沒有無限的繾綣，死也只是一種安靜的休息。然而對於我，我怎樣才能够忘記她那貓一般的腦袋，蒼白的臉孔，濃黑的頭髪，疲倦而憂思的眼睛啊！於是，我，每次聽見蕭邦的「夜曲」，眼睛裏總像小孩子一般的噙着淚珠兒。訓練與修養說「回頭」  超凡　　硬着頭皮，勇往直前是漢子，縮頭縮尾，欲行又止是懦夫，這是人們常常用以鼓勵別人作事要有能力和堅忍心，不要長縮猶豫或者半途而廢，中道回頭的箴語。的確，一個人作事，如果遇事都無勇敢堅決的精神，走到中途便回頭，不肯向前幹到底，那麼你一生的事業總是會前功盡棄，一無所成的。因為如此，所以回頭這兩個字，在這種情形下說來是最不好的。它是代表着一種不堅決的勇敢，　　力的　　的行動，是為任何有担當有魄力的硬漢所不取的。　　但是，我們也常聽到人們說「回頭是佛」這樣一句話。這句話本源出於宗教，它是教人改邪歸正，去惡就善，因而你就可以在一回頭之中，由罪人變成佛，由地獄躍登天堂。所以這句話在本義上原是迷信的，因為成佛根本是幻想，人間天上本沒有佛這種東西，你就回一千一萬次頭也成不了佛的話雖如此說，但它在一般的俗人用語中，已經成為勸人改過自新的習慣語了。這就是說人不能無過，「過而能改，善莫大焉。」如果一個人做着錯事和壞事，也一琮要硬着頭皮蠻幹下去，那麼這仍不能算是英雄漢子，只能算是繼續墮落不堪救藥，對於你自已個人和國家社會都是有害的。并且在這種情形下，愈能勇於回頭的，　　　　　　，因為唯</p>

<p>能於　息之間使之晦而復明；唯豪傑才能有不護短不晦過的勇氣。如此說來，則在這種情形下，回頭不但是正當的好的行為，而且也要硬漢才幹得出來，因為毅然改過自新也是要有最大的勇氣與魄力的。　　上述的兩點是一般人用回頭二字來預示將來的行動的，在檢查過去的行動時，普通也愛用回頭的字樣，并且也同樣有正反兩種意義。許多人在撫今思昔的時候，常常喟嘆着「往事不堪回首」，「回首」二字即是「回頭」二字的雅用，這是不待解說的。人們常喟嘆着「不堪回首」，這是一種感傷過去的詞調，不是感覺得今不如昔，便是感覺得昔不如今。當一個人以前是處於順境幸運之中，而今則歸於蕭條落魄時，他在感傷着好夢不常的情形下，便喟嘆着「不堪回首了」。反之，一個人過去做了許多不好的事，枉逝了年華歲月，空耗了精力錢財，他虛度了可貴的生命，一旦到了醒覺時，也是喟嘆着「不堪回首的」。所以當人們回頭去看他的歷史時，總是不是羨慕便是憎惡，這自然是會給他所經過的歷史作一番評價和檢討看的。　　過去的生活之檢討是未來的新生活的指南，在個人回需如此，即對於社會的運動也應如此。許多偉大的社會改良家或改造家，他們的未來成功都是確立在嚴格的檢討過去的　失上的。沒有舊的教訓來充實我們的經驗，指正我們將來的活動，則我們將不能認清客觀的整個發展趨勢。所以那些偉大的社會改良家或改造家，他們不但自己常常回頭去溫習歷史，并且時常教導人們對歷史回頭，去回顧歷史的發展，以決定將來的活動。如此，則無論是為個人，為國家或是為社會，在為了獲得經驗與教訓起見，向歷史回頭，回頭去嚴密地審察過去的得失，在人類的前進與新生活的開發上都有絕對的意義。并且不管你回頭的結果，對於過去的往事是給以好的或壞的評價，只要你是在獲得教訓，都是必要的。　　可是社會上也有這樣的人，當他回頭向舊的歷史注視時，他不是在於獲得歷史的教訓，而反迷醉於舊的陳跡，或則停止了前進，或則甚至跟着歷史的回頭，則恰恰和上述的對於過去歷史的回頭得出相反的結果，成為阻碍人類的進化的回頭。回頭即是反進化，這種回頭人類是不需要的。　　我們人類是生活在活的事變當中的，在複雜的事變與變化無窮的環境中，進行生活上的門爭，是不能很機械地採取固定的行動方式的。我們不能說在任何情境中處事都當毫不回頭。假使我們所努力的事業，在前面明明擺着一條成功的坦道，勝利已經顯示在眼前，此時我們因為有些本可克服的障碍阻住了我們，便畏難而退，採取了掉頭退卻的方法，那麼那可能的成功便會被你轉變成了失敗，這時回頭卻不是福而是禍。反之，如果在我們的前面明明擺着一個不通之路，無論怎樣努力向前衝去，仍然只有一個命定的失敗結果，這時我們若不知道回頭，而仍埋着頭不顧一切向前擠，結果自然只是老鼠擾牛角，愈擾愈緊愈沒有出路，終至於頭碰着墻白受流血的犧牲。這正如兩軍作戰一樣，如果敵人陣勢已經表現出不支的情形，這時你沒有勇氣前進，卻在回頭東顧西盼，甚至想回頭跑，那麼不但你沒有勝利可圖，而且會在敵人的反攻下敗北。又如果照戰略上說是應該退卻的，那麼這時就應該回頭來很迅速地退卻。假使不然的話，還要硬着頭皮往前衝，或者猶豫不肯回頭後退，則結果不是全軍覆沒，便是會被敵人包圍。人類在生活的戰綫上也是一樣。　　總之，不是一切回頭都是好的或壞的，也不是一切不回頭都是好的或壞的。在就避免失敗，改正錯誤，獲取過去的教訓上說，各種性質的回頭都是應當的，正確的。但是在就爭取可能的勝利，在要不使自己成為時代的落伍者上說，一切性質的不回頭卻又是正確的，應當的。所以我們只有依複雜的事態之性質，情景的變化，來決定我們回頭不回頭。國際情報美國的工商業  瑟瑩　　操有金元王國的雅號之美利堅合眾國，在舉世鬧着不景氣的時候，它也不能不在它的王座上戰慄不安，胡佛總統因此去了繼任總統的機會而凄涼地離別白宮。羅斯福總統雖長袖善舞，但一個個智囊從懷中掏出來，卻都成了朝陽下的雨露，得見實效者，十未得一。　　美國的工商業曾經放着光耀千古的異彩，確是不容諱言的，但他們的經濟學家都不能深入地觀察清楚美國經濟的進程與預測這工商業趨勢的前途，無計盡的生產，終於一敗塗地。我們只要看獨占資本的政黨—共和黨，在前屆競選時，他們沒有政綱，而只是一句「為大家好」的口號來聯絡小資產階級，農民，勞動階級的選舉人，就可信然。　　美國的經濟狀態，差不多有一定的恐慌焦點，頂重要的就是汽車業，煤業，油業，建築業，各種按期付款的營業，證券投機等。在汽車業方面，必然會到達過量生產的一天。僅僅福特公司一家，每年能產汽車二百五十萬輛，但牠的競爭者也都在儘量發揮其生產能力，儘量出產廉其價汽車，通用汽車公司即「迎頭趕上」於前，其他中等汽車公司又「亦步亦趨」於後，於是美國汽車工廠的總能力每年至少可出六百萬輛。這樣激烈競爭的結果，中小汽車工廠必然被打倒，商戰的慘劇悲劇，都似循着同一方式排演下去。　　煤產也有過剩之勢。在一九二八年，雖有礦工大罷工，產額略有低落，但堆棧中并未略有減少。嗣後尖銳的過量生產，其危機就一發而不可收拾了。　　煤油業也有同樣的命運。煤油每日照常出產二百四十萬桶，堆棧中的存貨日積月累，現在已足供全國一年之用；物價趨向跌落，危機殆所難免。　　因為整個世界市場購買力的薄弱，生產過剩，大批失業工人便像流行性感冒似的盛行着，而使按期付款的營業者大失其營業的憑靠。因為失業的工人與受雇者沒有方法來購買這些家用，車輛，衣物等用品，因此危及投資於此類商行之財政企業的地位。　　交易所的投機也非常盛行，一天之內有四五百萬餘股票在紐約證券交易所中買賣，行市的漲跌極大。這種證券交易　　　　　　趨勢。　　除關這些危機原素以外，美國的農業恐慌也在經常的狀態中，且百尺竿頭將更上一層之勢。至於勞動階級，鮑爾士會關有一百萬元完全失業的工人，三百萬短期工作者，但據正確的統計，據說已有五百六十萬至八百萬之間的賦閒者　　現下，農業與礦業，他們都是在有計競的減少工人，商業，汽車業，建築業，也因整個的合理化運動，而在經當地關除不熟練的工人。　　業　　　工商業的情　廠如此　　間蒼穹，何時才有景氣的來復呢？羅斯福費了九牛二虎之力，也無異醉漢舉着雙手向太空中劃一個大圈而已。　　啟事　西如，蘧陽，囚亡，明耀，錢匡時，史，逸書，寗人，鮑，祖安，鍾民誼，蕭萍，諸君公鑒，十月份承惠賜大作，曷勝感紉！稿費業已結算清楚，請於每月六日至十日，十六日至二十日（星期日除外），每日下午二時至四時，具條蓋章，向本館會計處領取為荷。　　（申報業餘周刊編輯部啟）文藝作品提賬簿（一）  僕漁　　在半路上。　　到一個茅草店，車夫們嚷着「打尖」。我呢，打起官腔命令他們趕快拉走sk是兩個王八蛋都把車子一擱，扁着嗓子叫：　　「餓啦！肚皮是肉做的呢！」　　媽的！餓死又有鳥緊？躭誤了我的公事，纔非同小可呢！—不過腸子沒有塞滿，跑不動倒是真的。　　雞毛店的飲食，祇合下流人—車夫的腸胃，我瞧一眼便幾乎發嘔：可恨那醜女人還問：　　「這位老爺吃呀？」　　媽的，我真想用她一耳光，好在江錫五帮我罵了：　　「說話不分輕重，你這飲食配…？」　　還沒有罵的痛快，我取出一枝「砲臺」散一散氣；，剛含在嘴里，老江趕快摸起火柴，「擦」的一聲便給我點燃了。這小子真巴結得我不過意，說不得也給他一枝；他伸着兩手如捧聖旨，臉上堆起笑塊：　　「謝謝主任！」　　我吐了一口煙霧，纔答復一個「嗯」字。因為上司的架子不能馬虎，愛他祇能藏在心里。　　「主任，元太槽坊那事，究竟…？」　　下半句要吐不吐的，但是我明白想探虛實。那可行？我還是乘人里面挑選來的呢。於是扳起面孔，冷冷的盯他一眼：　　「省局有命令來，局長也有電報，不要亂想！」（未完）文藝作品藥舖  毛延年　　已經是中暑天氣，正是「熱病」和「瘧疾」流行的季節，所謂「　暑熱人大夫不停」，論理該是醫生和藥舖「生意興隆」的時候，如果是往年—　　「如果是往年啥，」夏大夫說，「道時我已經忙的透不過氣來，我們藥舖的生意也…」　　「誰說不？我還牢牢記得：有一天你在櫃檯上就看了二十五個病，又下鄕看了四個。還賣了五十二付藥。單說現錢就有百把吊。那時，那時…嗯嗯…」，大夫娘子說着說着便有點兒感慨，「那時不單我們的生意好，別家也很…」　　真的，那時不單夏大夫的「復生堂」「生意興隆」，別家也是「財源茂盛」，就是王和尚那麼個狗屎醫生和他開的那個狗屎藥舖也有許多人看病，也有許多人抓藥，不過總趕不上夏大夫那麼「了不得」，因為柳鎮上的七位醫生，七家藥舖，要算夏大夫頂有名氣，要算「復生堂」的招牌頂老，據說他的祖父曾在太醫院樣自給皇帝醫好過病，現在他家中堂上掛的那副「功同國手」的大匾，便是御筆賜書的。老太醫告老回鄕後，就在柳鎮上開設了這家藥舖—「復生堂」，於是一傅小太醫，再傳至現在的夏大夫。本來，大夫初出世時也被人們稱為「太醫」，過後因為民國成立，纔慢慢改稱為「大夫」。然而不管稱呼怎樣改變，夏大夫仍不失為「世代儒醫」，因之諸的人特別多，藥舖的生意也特別好，每天轎子來轎子去的，十分踴躍，十分的「威風」！不過請他的人大都是官員，紳士，至於貧苦的人，因為怕他架子大，要錢多，平時不敢請，總要到了病重的時候，纔鼓起勁兒請他一次兩次，所以柳鎮的村間，如果有了夏大夫的轎子出現，便知道某人的病已經是十分的沉重了。　　可是近幾年來，請夏大夫看病的人漸漸少了，「復生堂」的藥漸漸不「暢銷」了，於是夏大夫黃莫明其所以然的，不曉得很着急：「這是什麼道理？難道病人死完了！」　　「說鬼話！」大夫娘子不贊成的說，「病人倒多，我看還是怪你架子太大，動不動一出門就要坐轎，你想窮人害病，請醫生要借轎子，要弄飲食，要給脈禮，要給藥錢，那得那麼多的錢化？我看你…」　　夏大夫點一點頭，撚一撚鬍鬚。以後真的少坐轎，不吃窮人的飲食，脈禮也不大計較，這麼一來，窮苦的病人就漸漸的來請他了，而且還對別人宣傳：「夏大夫現在對了，沒有什麼苛派。」　　可是當這今年的暑季，聽說回鄕害「瘧疾」的人很多，怎麼請看病的人這麼少？他在魔廂房里慢慢踱來踱去，左手抱着一隻白銅水煙袋，右手的紙捻燃了寸多長的灰，眉頭皺得很緊，似乎很難想穿其中的道理，最後忽然氣忿的說：「媽的，世間有這麼奇怪的事：病人不請醫生，不吃藥！我行了三十年醫，沒有像現在這樣…」　　他正想往下說，忽然看見兒子拿着的那一本書後封面上有着「瘧疾聖藥」四字，再看下面便是「金鷄納霜」，他忍不住心里的氣忿，一下把煙袋重重的擱在茶几上，嘴里使勁的罵：「媽的，什麼東西「聖藥」，我肯信醫得好病！」　　兒子吃驚的把一「皇腿」取了下來，坐正身子，碌起眼睛望着他，半天纔說：「你老人家在氣甚麼？」　　「甚麼？你看—」他把兒子手里的書取過來，指着後封面，「你看這不是胡說嗎？」　　兒子這纔明白他生氣的原因，於是笑笑的說：　　「這也犯不着氣。不過現在信仰西醫的人很多，西藥也就暢銷全國，就是我們學校也請的西醫…」　　「哼！」老頭子更氣，「你們這些年青人，讀了幾句洋書便忘了本，怎麼西醫能同中醫來比，他們診斷不計「望，聞，問，切」，用共不計「陰陽五行」，不分「君臣父子」，連「心肝脾腎」都弄不清楚，還曉得什末叫做「脈理」，什末叫做「藥性」。不說古聖先賢，就拿我來說，也世以來不知醫好了多少險症，惡疾，假如遇到西醫，那就糟了！要知西醫用的藥都是「覇道」，中藥則是「王道…」　　「好了，好了，把你那些話拿去對病從說吧，你總是這樣老脾氣，祇說自己的狠，但別人偏要找西醫，你看橫街賈二太太前夫不是進城住醫院嗎？前幾年我們鎮上的有錢人看病，差不多都是請你看，可是現在他們總愛找西醫，我說…」　　大夫娘子還沒有說完，大夫便截住了她的話，說「你們都說西醫了不得，那我這手藝就不做了！讓全家人活活的餓死好麼？」　　兒子覺得難為情似的說：「也并不是說西醫了不得，不過有許多信仰他，對於我們的生意總有影響，同時現在的人一天比一天窮，有許多都沒錢醫病，捱得過便捱過去了。」　　老頭子沒有話可說，但心里還很氣忿，他恨有些人為什麼要找西醫，為什麼不看病，於是很想閭揚中醫的「奧妙精深」，揭穿西醫的「胡說八道」，如此纔能挽回人心，自己的生意纔得變好。但是用什末方法呢？想來想去總得不着一個計較，最後纔忽然想起，本鎮上不是常有人來粘貼廣告，宣傳某西醫或藥品的長處和功效嗎？對了，西醫其所以被人信仰，便是由於會宣傳，他能幹這一手，難道自己就幹不來？於是心里一鬆，眼睛一亮，便以決定的態度，命令兒子，「你跟我拿幾張包藥的黃紙回來。」　　夏大夫磨好了墨，蘸好了筆，在黃紙上一揮…路，仁術也，石者，神農嘗百草而知藥性，乃教民以醫，傳至後代，義理昌明，術亦求精，如仲景之治內，華扁之治外，固有起死回生之妙，豈乏神丹仙藥之功哉？迨至近季，世風漸離，人心忘本，尊西醫為神聖，奉西醫為錄品，於是邪魔妖道散見中國，牛溲馬勃播於四方，而不知西醫不諳脈理，不識藥性，如此陰陽不分，疾何能瘳？本堂世代儒醫，家傳秘訣，且先大父曾充太醫，親愈上疾，本人出世以來，熟讀本草，縣壼三十載，所遇險症無不藥到病除。邇來暑氣蒸人，病由是起，本人體念「醫乃仁術」之義，凡貧苦就診者，不收藥資，盍興乎來！　　　夏大夫興致勃勃的寫了五張，隨又搖頭讀了一遍，於是很得意的望着兒子：「你看比那些西藥房的廣告如何？」　　「好倒好。」兒子笑笑的說，「祇怕有許多人看不懂。」　　「不懂？這多麼透徹。」　　兒子的話似乎有點使他掃興，但沒有計較，卻吩咐徒弟先把中堂上的匾和兩邊的木質對聯刷拭乾凈，（因為中堂即是給有錢人看脈的地方）然後把櫃房周圍掛的那些小匾封，如像「仲景遺風」呀，「扁鵲再世」呀，都要刷的刷，洗的洗，趁着今天是「冷場」，（我們那裏的場鎮，集日呌「當場」，平時叫「冷場」，又叫「閒日子」）務要弄得整齊一點，同時又呌兒子把藥匣外的藥名條子換成新紅紙條。　　一切一切都佈置好了。　　第二天是當場的日子，而還是一個「大場」，夏大夫清晨從床上爬起來，一壁洗臉，一壁吩咐徒弟把黃紙條貼一張在舖門口，其餘的兩頭場口各貼一張，關帝廟和萬年檯上也各貼一張。於是親自打開舖板門，把那新鮮的，明顯的金字招牌掛在當街的那一邊，又把藥房里那座鋼　子，擦得透亮，然後張牠掛一條紅，更顯得壯觀。他這纔輕輕鬆了一口氣，看着徒弟擦櫃檯，揩藥刀，掃藥凳，加過一番整理後，藥房裏卻有新的氣象了！　　吃過早飯，夏大夫穿了一件清潔的藍麻布衫，聚精會神的坐在櫃房裏的高凳上，兩眼望着街上過往的趕早場的人們。本來他平日，尤其是前幾年，很少親自坐櫃檯，因為這樣很失面子，大都有人來看病時，由徒弟來請纔得出來，今天這麼早的坐在櫃檯上，卻是破　　以下接第五版</p>

<p>題兒第一遭，但是為了挽救生意，為了使病人知道是閒的，不得不親自來守候。同時他想今早纔貼出去了幾張廣告，看病的人定很擁擠，要知窮人是貪便宜的，而且也想找好醫生的，祇要我夏大夫不擺架子，不多要錢，難道那些狗屎醫生還比得過我嗎？　　早場快登頂了，鄕裏賣麥子賣豌豆的男客或婦人，都挑着擔子或背着　　，彎腰駝背的向關帝廟的糧食市拐去。櫃房外的雜貨攤已經擺好，對門那家涼粉攤也在切葱，調蒜水，街上也有許多提籃的人在走動了。這時差不多已經到了已刻，依習慣上說，是病人應該上藥舖的時候，因為鄕裏人看病，總是一早上場，纔免受暑熱。但「復生堂」還沒有開張，夏大夫不免有些着急，而且還有占犯疑惑：「怎麼還是沒有看病呢？難道廣告不生效嗎？不，也許時間還早。」於是又耐心的守候。　　真的，不久便有一個老漢，還有一個年青女人，又有一個小夥子，都來看了病，雖有一付藥沒取分文，但脈禮錢卻弄了兩串，連同那兩個的「脈禮」，「藥資」共有一元左右。夏大夫透了一口氣，心裏覺得輕鬆許多。可是祇這麼電光一閃，雷雨便成了過去。街上雖然擁擠，藥房裏卻是靜寂寂的。夏大夫皺着眉頭，兩眼迎送着擁擠的人們。其中有面色憔悴的老者，有滿副病容的青年人，有的額角上流着汗水，有的還穿着棉坎肩，頭上包着青帕，這些人都像有幾分病容，有的彷彿還心沉重。夏大夫心裏想：「為什末不看病，不吃藥呢？—別家怎樣？」於是裝了一副嚴厲的面孔，命令徒弟：「你看他們那幾家的生意怎樣？」　　一會兒徒弟回來很恭敬的說：「幾家都不大好，祇有「道生堂」的櫃檯上擺着兩付藥（病人看過脈，便到別處休息，等到下午太陽偏西纔回家，醫生配好藥擱在櫃檯上），王和尚撲在櫃檯上睡覺…」　　夏大夫點一一點頭，喉管裏哼出一個「嗯」字。別家生意不好，倒給他很大的安慰，但轉想自己的生意也不大「那個」，於是又覺有幾分歉意！這時已經是正午了，天氣熱，心裏煩燥，兼之昨天累了一天，今朝又起的很早，週身很感疲乏。他本想回到後面睡一會兒覺，但又怕有人來看病。沒辦法，祇好一手撐着頭，靠在櫃檯上，當他剛要睡熟的時候，忽然聽着橫街上幾聲鑼響，打鑼的人粗大嗓音跟即鑽入耳來：「一言告之：本鎮現奉縣長命令：各甲花戶，所欠民國八十一年糧稅，限於三日完清，否則追未拿人休得見怪啊！—「鐺，鐺，鐺」還有一言：本街各住戶之「開門捐」，各商舖之「見面捐」，各小攤之「地皮捐」統限於今日繳納鎮公所，公事緊急，休得延誤為當呵！—「鐺，鐺，鐺」。　　鑼聲完結，人們馬上驚惶，擾動，在那人聲嘈雜中，間有一兩句可聽清楚：　　「要逼死人呵！這樣苛派過了，那樣又來了！」　　「現在甚麼世道呵！一年完十幾次糧！…」　　夏大夫心裏想：「真的「什末世道」呵！難怪病人沒錢看病，沒錢吃藥啦！」播音節目特別節目　　大風社　　李樹德（九四〇）上午九時至十時　　滑稽舞（張承沛）Gosse　de　Paris（戴曼如）杯杯高歌（包芳芸）桃色夫人（嚴昌緒）Dinah（戴曼如）溜冰隊（徐漣）Get　Ort　And　　Get　Under　Moon（Fox—Trot）（包芳芸）賣藥娘（嚴昌緒）梅花三弄（二重奏）（包芳芸）（張承沛）蝴蝶夫人（徐漣）馬爾達（分解和音張承沛）Alyma（嚴昌緒）浮士德圓舞曲（徐漣）Santiago（嚴昌緒）女神舞（二重奏）（張承沛）（徐漣）　　青光口琴隊　　建華（七四〇）上午十時至十一時　　威廉退爾（二重奏）西班牙風圓舞曲（獨奏）鞭與鐵馬刺進行曲（二重奏）回憶（許企傑作）（獨奏）小桃紅（獨奏）東方薔薇（二重奏）森林之鐵匠（獨奏）梅花三弄（二重奏）學生進行曲（獨奏）茶花女（二重奏）　　藝聲口琴組　　友聯（八八〇）上午十時半至十一時半　　文華先生教授口琴　中國名曲（戴曼如）司令行進（文華）（孔亞青）（請求）Cuckoo　Walt（戴曼如）魔彈槍手（文華分解音）（請求）西班牙古舞（戴曼如）　　綠葉社音樂話劇　　華泰（五六〇）上午十一時至十二時　　父歸　　劉賢明（兄）…林蜚　　新民（弟）…胡為　　素芳（妹）…陳翔　　珍娘（母）…沈默　　道誠（父）…馬翎　　配首…韓白…劉桀　　嚶嚶歌唱社　　大陸（六二〇）下午二時至二時三刻　　南京進行曲（前奏曲）丁香山（蓉萱）賣油條（秀蘭）特別快車（曼麗）蘇三不要哭（秀蘭）漁光曲（蓉萱）桃李刦（全體）永別了弟弟（曼麗）　　鮑明珊君「教授演奏短音階口琴」　　華美（一〇六〇）下午二時至三時　　教授荒城之月（短音階和音分解奏法）巴黎風光（短音階長音階并用樂曲）船歌（短音階和音分解奏法）宵待草（和聲短音階）江戶子守　（短音階和音分解）塞加斯之歌（短音階可弗奏法）　　音社　　航業（一三八〇）下午三時至三時半　　娘子軍（飛妹）特別快車（飛飛）漁翁樂（飛妹）悲秋（飛飛）夜來香（飛妹）野草閒花（飛飛）（飛妹）　　話劇　　「摩登夫地」下午三時半至四時　　第一幕—鄒翔生因追求秀娟，把自己的腿折傷，到醫院夫認識她，終達到目的。　　藝聲音樂會歌詠隊　　利利（一二四〇）下午五時至五時三刻　　西宮詞（朱鵬）春潮曲（瑪莉）漂泊者（蔣建）蝴蝶姑娘（雪楓）定情歌（朱翼）戀愛歌（俊英）妹妹我怪我怪你（朱方）　　時代歌劇播音社　　佛音（九八〇）下午五時至五時三刻　　十里長亭十杯酒（林鶯）批漁的姑娘（王琪）別字巴黎（叔牙）我的愛人就是您（林鶯）（叔牙）窮富姻緣（王琪）航空救國（合成牙）安慰（劍魂）　　桃花扇　　話劇　下午時裝店　時半至七時一刻　　孫道誠以三千元使謝素芳和魯步同脫離所謂保護人的關係，某一天，方與民和素芳卻結婚了，不辛得很在洞房裏，素芳的舅喝醉了說出不可告人的秘密，什麼秘密？也許關於…？！　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時至六時　　新毛毛雨（前奏曲）舟中回（璐玲）瑪麗若是你願意（陳萍）小天使（珂玲）娥眉月（沈玲鐵蹄下的歌女）（璐玲）等一等吧（陳萍沈瑛我願意（柴瑟）夜深深（瑛瑛）再會吧巴黎斐君璐玲）追求（沈瑛）努力（全體）餘音　　玫瑰團招收祇供給車費的男女音樂歌唱練習生幾位，不過限定對於音樂歌唱略有相當的資格的。　　徐健出了上海社，不一天，給周璇胡佛劉衡之拖回去。　　現在歌星大多有點太太氣，領導的人惟有叩頭求拜，不然就會使你哭笑不得。　　玫瑰團道次的大掃除後，新陣綫是：琰莉玲玲，汪曇傑，江曼莉。　　汪曼傑的下嫁玫瑰，和江汪莉的重為　婦，都是出於人意料之外的，這也是聽眾的耳福。　　播音機又停刊，銀雨也許在陰世繼續主辦，不過在生前曾說過願與白雪合作，這一張期票當然是「與出票人接洽」了。　　藝化社幾年前孫貞創辦，雖然現在不大聽見，但是并沒有解散，昨天看報又有藝化團織組，社和團祇錯一個字，將來難免和美華音樂會般的爭執起來，并且說不定也會像大舞臺對過一樣的掛起招牌來，一笑。（以上無私）電影消息「凱歌」中的「大王廟」  白木　　藝華公司不惜重大犧牲從事攝製的全部有聲對白歌唱鉅片「凱歌」中，有一幕「大王廟」的大佈景。這幕佈景的深度直跨了整個攝製組百數十丈且不管它，單就所用的木材的數目，乃至所用人工（包括木匠，泥水匠，小工等）的數額，已就相當的驚人。還有，內中所安奉的七八十尊的泥菩薩，大大小小，長長短短，牛頭馬面，紅臉青身，直是鬼氣迫，陰森可怕。但同時也十足表現出中國廟字的莊嚴氣象。　　拍這幕戲的時候，參加演又多至六七百人，戲雖然不十分多，但因頗為隆重，所以一連拍了三天三夜，始把這場戲拍完。當攝製的時候，導演卜成蒼又很慎重從事，對於每一個鏡頭的角度，乃至燈光的配置，都事先與攝影師吳蔚雲經過多番的探討和考慮。故這幕戲，不僅空氣處理得十分莊嚴緊張，就是攝影技巧也非常的優越美妙，所以將　公映之日，其能獲得觀眾之絕聲讚美自無疑義。銀色雜畢  之爾　　敢推荐「欽差大臣」於讀者君之前，至少，從滿堂的笑聲裏，便給了你們最好的保證；這一位「引起發笑勝過引起憂鬱的」作家—果戈里—的作品「欽差大臣」，是　滿了否定官僚政治之力的。　　看慣了插特打你的所謂「喜劇」的，我希望他看一看「欽差大臣」，至少，從「欽差大臣」裏，可以明瞭喜劇究竟是怎樣一會事。　　據說「欽差大臣」的結束，本來是還有一個尾巴的，那就是那位「糊塗混賬」的「縣長老爺」朗着觀眾說：「笑我們幹什麼！笑你們自己吧」！不過因為審查不通過，所以現在以施丹尼斯拉夫基的演出方法來結束，讓觀眾看看「活人畫」，給一個回想的機會。　　看到第四幕金山狂吻着葉露茜，有位觀眾說：要是趙丹見了表何感想呢？　　又有位觀眾說：那位假欽差應該讓趙丹來飾，這樣，不是可以多一個享樂的機會？惠爾勒何爾塞兩個「糊塗偵探」  大上海映</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain Japanese newspaper in Shanghai published a dispatch from Nanjing on the 31st stating that Vice Foreign Minister Tang visited Japanese Consul-General Suma early that morning, etc., in a lengthy news article. According to reliable sources, this report is completely fabricated. Not only did Vice Foreign Minister Tang not meet with any foreign guests that morning, but Consul-General Suma had not yet returned to Nanjing that day, making a meeting impossible.

<p>Central Hospital Reports on Patient's Condition</p>

According to Central Hospital's announcement at 11:00 AM on the 2nd, Wang's temperature this morning was 37.5 degrees, a slight decrease from yesterday; his pulse was 82, and his respiration was 18, both within normal range. He slept very well on the night of the 1st, so his spirits were even better this morning. He spoke normally and maintained a stable demeanor. This morning, he consumed milk, chicken soup, and orange juice. After the meal, he requested to read the newspaper. Because the doctor ordered him not to overwork, the Central Daily News was presented to him, and Wang briefly read it before Chen Bijun read aloud various important news items. Wang was quite pleased after listening.

<p>(Nanjing) Sun Fengming, the assassin who attacked Premier Wang, was also sent to Central Hospital after being shot by Wang's guards. Because he was shot in vital areas and lost too much blood, he died in the hospital at 3:45 AM on the 2nd. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice Orders Investigation of Assassination Attempt</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice believes that the assassination attempt on Premier Wang is a serious case and has ordered the Chief Prosecutor of the Supreme Court Procuratorate to investigate and prosecute the matter. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The military police authorities have instructed all officers under their command to pay attention to apprehending the culprits and bringing them to justice, and to pay special attention to maintaining public order in the city to ensure safety. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Ten Suspects Released on Bail</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the assassination attempt on Premier Wang occurred on the 1st, police arrested a total of 18 suspects. Two more were arrested on the 2nd. After two rounds of interrogation, ten have been released on bail, and the remaining one is still being held by the department for investigation. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Heads of Various Agencies Interrogate the Assassin</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Fengming, the assassin who attacked Premier Wang, was shot twice by Wang's guards on the 1st and sent to Central Hospital for treatment. However, both bullets hit the lungs, precisely in vital areas, and he lost too much blood, so he ultimately succumbed to his injuries. He died at 3:45 AM on the morning of the 2nd. At dawn, the Second Police Bureau transferred the body to the Capital Court. After the Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang examined the body, he handed it over to the burial bureau for disposal. He had not yet been buried on the 2nd. After the suspect was sent to the hospital, physicians treated him while senior officials from the Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Military Police Department, Police Department, Supreme Court, and Procuratorate interrogated him rigorously. By noon on the 1st, the suspect was in critical condition. Doctors injected stimulants, and Gu Zhenglun, Chen Zhuo, Tao Luqian, Peng Xuepei, and others jointly interrogated him for a long time. In the end, the suspect repeatedly complained of a headache and refused to speak. There is no doubt that the suspect's attack was a planned conspiracy. After his arrest, six small silver coins, two pieces of American ginseng, three pieces of chewing gum, and one opium pipe were found on his person. The fact that the suspect did not carry a large amount of money indicates that he did not intend to flee far, and the opium pipe suggests that he intended to take advantage of an opportunity to commit suicide. The letter left at the Chenguang News Agency, which was searched by the police department, further proves this. However, according to participating investigators, the motive and background of the assassination are still difficult to speculate. In addition, the twenty suspects arrested on the 1st were taken to the Qingliangshan Police Training Center, where they were jointly interrogated by major officials from the Party, government, military, police, and courts from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 2nd. Some individuals were found to have little connection to the case, so five were released, seven were released on bail, and eight remain in custody for further questioning. (Central News Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited Central Hospital tonight to inquire about Premier Wang's condition and learned that he is almost out of danger. Surgery was performed this afternoon, and the bullet fragments in his left cheek have been removed, but the bullet in his back has not yet been removed. Sun Fengming, the assassin who attacked Wang, died in Central Hospital at 3:45 AM this morning from his injuries. After receiving the news of Sun's death, the Jiangning District Court immediately conducted an examination and determined that he died from gunshot wounds. The body was handed over to the funeral home for burial. After Sun was arrested yesterday, he was rigorously interrogated by the authorities for several hours. At midnight, Sun became increasingly weak, and doctors injected stimulants to continue the interrogation. According to Sun's confession, the attack on Wang was purely his own initiative and was not directed by anyone else. As for Hu Yunqing, the president of Chenguang News Agency, and He Boguang, the editor-in-chief, they left Beijing at midnight on Thursday. However, some witnesses said that they saw Hu and He on Friday morning, so these two actually left the capital on Friday morning. Hu and He are both natives of Zhenjiang, so the police department has telegraphed the Zhenjiang authorities to conduct a thorough search, but they have not yet been apprehended. After midnight, Sun Fengming complained of severe headaches and refused to answer questions. He died at 3:45 AM. Police searched his pockets and found opium, indicating that he was prepared to commit suicide upon being arrested. It is now known that Hu and He are indeed the main culprits in this case, and the authorities are determined to apprehend them. In addition to the suspect Sun, more than twenty other suspects have been arrested. The police department conducted separate rigorous interrogations from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM this morning, and as a result, five were released, seven were released on bail, and the remaining eight remain in custody for further questioning.

<h3 id="e5">The Impact of Speculative Gold Trading <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>As the time approaches for settling long-term deposit accounts at the end of the year, there is concern that gold prices have suddenly experienced an unusual surge. In the past half-month, foreign exchange rates have risen sharply, commodity prices have soared, and speculation has led to extreme price fluctuations. It is natural that society is shocked and people are uneasy. Those who are not familiar with the concept of inflation believe that it is simply due to the increased issuance of paper money. As a result, those with cash are trying to hide it, and those with assets believe that it is better to hoard goods for speculation than to hold currency and suffer losses. The demand for gold and foreign exchange bills has further increased, and silver has unexpectedly concentrated in foreign banks, with the premium reaching as high as seventy cents, remaining unchanged for four days. Chinese entities have been selling silver in the London market continuously for eighteen days without stopping. It is not surprising that capital is moving towards safe havens. However, China is suffering from a shortage of silver. Last winter, there was a move to levy a balancing tax. Although silver imports exceeded seven million in the third quarter of this year, gold exports exceeded thirteen million, resulting in a net outflow.</p>
<p>Since gold prices are settled in Customs Gold Units, it is generally understood that it is not easy for foreign businesses to convert currency freely. However, gold prices have continued to rise daily recently. The authorities have intervened to maintain stability, but with little effect. As a result, rumors that the Gold Exchange Standard will be implemented and Customs Gold Unit notes will be issued have become increasingly prevalent. It is clear that such talk seems plausible but is not actually true. Currency reform has its own steps and preparations and cannot be achieved instantaneously. However, the general public believes that without a strong correction, it is best to just listen and see what happens. The most worrying aspect is that the continuous rise in gold prices has made everyone wary of legitimate transactions. For example, silk and other commodities have seen a decrease in recent transactions due to this reason. If it is once known that the rumors are false, the reaction will be unstoppable. Both of these losses are due to speculators.</p>
<p>For the sake of the overall situation, we feel compelled to speak out on the following points: (1) In today's environment of exhausted commercial finance, the chaotic situation of speculation cannot last long. Sitting idly by without taking remedial action will only create a more serious situation and accelerate the flight of capital. Therefore, the authorities should make a clearer and more responsible statement to reassure the public. (2) Given the complexity of China's political and economic situation and the distorted structure of the market, any reform should avoid actions that are counterproductive. However, past observations reveal that opportunities have often been created for foreigners, which is regrettable. (3) The shift of credit from domestic to foreign entities has been a long-standing issue. The early use of foreign currency notes and the recent willingness to exchange large amounts of cash for a piece of paper from a foreign bank show that the Chinese people are not without the concept of fiduciary money. If it can be used well, who knows if it cannot be successful? Therefore, how to establish a credible system, shift the psychological dependence on foreign entities, and gain the trust of the people are critical issues to address today. (4) Global finance is still difficult to stabilize, and currency adjustments are extremely difficult. Although news from the United States suggests that the Chinese currency will be stabilized at 2.5 Customs Gold Units and 26.8 US cents, given China's large trade deficit, meager income from sources other than trade, and various other obstacles, this seems unlikely. (5) At this time of great difficulty and pressing external threats, reform is more difficult than usual. Conspiracies and sabotage are rampant. Therefore, how to preserve a line of survival for our national economy depends on having an independent spirit and the will to survive on our own.</p>

<p>British Newspapers Express Great Concern</p>
<p>(London) This morning, all newspapers paid close attention to the assassination attempt on Chinese President Wang. The diplomatic correspondent of the Morning Post stated that Londoners considered this assassination to be a very significant event. The Daily Telegraph reported that the assassination attempt on President Wang was a warning about the various difficulties faced by Nanjing. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, with the assistance of President Wang and others, had made great progress in the past four years towards the restoration of order and unity in China. Although the activities of the Communist Party had spread to some extent this summer, they were still limited to smaller areas. As for the economy, there had been significant progress. The Times stated that this case was a pre-planned riot. President Wang was a sincere and patriotic politician who had devoted himself to the revolution and was now a constructive member of the Nanjing government. We deeply hope that the fears of future disputes arising from his health will not be proven by facts. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Add Color and Exaggeration</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After President Wang was injured by an assailant on the morning of the 1st, Japanese newspapers exaggerated in many ways, claiming that other important figures were also injured, or speculating on the background of the assassination. The Information Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially sent Section Chief Shao to visit the Japanese Embassy and requested their attention, and to convey to the Japanese newspaper offices that they should act cautiously to avoid being accused of inciting conflict. It is reported that the Japanese Embassy has expressed its intention to comply. Shao also warned the Japanese reporters stationed in Nanjing that they must have reliable evidence when publishing news in the future and must not fabricate information based on conjecture.

<p>(Tianjin) The Xianghe incident is supported by the United Association of Representatives of Hebei Counties and the Chinese Democratic League, which are organized by traitors.

<h3 id="e11">Oii Arrives in Tianjin to Negotiate Telecommunications Between Guannei and Guanwai <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Vice Minister of Communications Oii came to Tianjin, visited the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, and met with Director Wang Ruoxi to discuss matters related to communications between Guannei (inside the customs) and Guanwai (outside the customs). On the 2nd, Oii visited Gu Zhen, director of the Tianjin Telephone Bureau, to discuss long-distance telephone exchanges and communications between Guannei and Guanwai. Oii is scheduled to go to Shenyang on the 3rd. Regarding the issue of Japanese telegrams between Guannei and Guanwai, according to the person in charge of the Tianjin Telegraph Bureau, it is limited to wired telegraph transmissions between Tianjin and Shenyang. The Tianjin General Bureau is the only telegraph bureau in Guannei, and Shenyang is the telegraph bureau in Guanwai. When Japanese people in the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Zone in Jilin, Changchun, Harbin, and Qiqihar send Japanese telegrams, they are forwarded by the Shenyang Wired Telegraph Bureau. This does not mean that all wireless telegraphs can be sent and received. However, Chinese telegrams can be sent and received by wireless telegraphs, regardless of the Tianjin-Shenyang line. (Special Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The telegraph bureau established by the Japanese in Shanhaiguan is a "helping telegraph bureau" dedicated to handling the transfer of Japanese telegrams between Guannei and Guanwai. Due to the excessive length and weak power of the Tianjin-Shenyang line, in order to speed up transmission, the Tianjin Bureau sends telegrams to the Yuguan Telegraph Bureau, which then forwards them to the Japanese "helping telegraph bureau" before forwarding them to the Shenyang Bureau. The procedure for incoming telegrams is the same. Although the Beiping Telegraph Bureau is actively preparing, the exact date for receiving and sending Japanese telegrams has not yet been determined.

<p>Representatives of Fifty Nations Unanimously Agree, Anglo-Italian Negotiations Fail Once Again, French Foreign Minister Pursuing a Different Path</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Eighteen of the League of Nations decided today to recommend to the General Committee that economic sanctions be imposed on Italy, effective November 18th. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The fifty nations in the Sanctions Committee unanimously agreed on that date, but Chile made certain reservations. French Prime Minister Laval gave a short speech, reiterating his belief that the League of Nations could resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and that he had begun talks with Italy based on the Franco-Italian friendship treaty. He assured the committee that France would not act outside the League of Nations. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Hoare held a three-quarter-hour conversation with Italian representative Aloisi this morning. It is reported that Hoare detailed Britain's position and clearly stated that while Britain was eager to see a peaceful resolution, a resolution unfavorable to the Ethiopian Emperor or in conflict with the League of Nations Covenant was out of the question. It is now understood that no new basis for negotiation exists, but the search will continue. At the same time, both sides are eager to dispel the mistaken impression that there are any special disputes between Britain and Italy. This impression was caused by Italian anti-British propaganda and the large number of Italian troops stationed in Libya. If this impression can be removed and the tense atmosphere eased, it would be welcomed by both countries. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned here today that Italy has rejected the recent draft peace plan proposed by Britain and France. Italian chief delegate to the League of Nations, Sir Aloisi, made it clear during his meetings with Laval and Hoare that the East African war would continue. Sir Aloisi told Italian journalists today that if the proposals put forward by Laval this afternoon were all there was, there would be no hope for peace. Hoare and Aloisi, who were originally scheduled to talk again tomorrow, have been canceled today. The talk that reconciliation is hopeless has thus become more forceful. The League of Nations learned that Germany may follow the United States in banning the transportation of armaments and munitions to belligerent countries. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hoare and Laval informed each other of the impressions gained from their meetings with Italian representative Aloisi during lunch today and agreed on the speeches they would make in the Sanctions Committee this afternoon. It was rumored that the representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium had exchanged views on the Locarno Pact in Geneva, but this was not the case. Belgian Prime Minister Kollen claimed that he intended to request that the Sanctions Committee pass a resolution authorizing Britain and France to conduct negotiations on behalf of the League of Nations to peacefully resolve the Italian-Ethiopian dispute.

<p>(Geneva) The eighteen-nation committee's discussion on implementing sanctions against Italy should not hinder the issue of Italy's 32,950,000,000 yuan in bad debts owed to member states, resulting in a deadlock. During today's meeting, representatives from Romania, Yugoslavia, and Chile successively stated that Italy pays with goods, so if they refuse to accept Italian goods, they will sacrifice their debts. A small committee will now be organized to study this issue. (1st National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives from France, Romania, Yugoslavia, Spain, and Greece held a small committee meeting to discuss settling accounts with Italy. Many countries, especially Romania, are owed large sums of money by Italy, making their situation particularly difficult. This fact is an obstacle to the implementation of sanctions against Italy. The meeting lasted five hours, and a solution was finally agreed upon at 1:00 AM, stipulating that a date should be set for stopping the purchase of Italian goods. As for unsettled debts, they will be specifically considered by the small committee dealing with mutual aid issues. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The implementation of economic sanctions against Italy was discussed here today, with attention paid to the date of implementation and the difficulties regarding settling contracts. However, a solution to the contract settlement issue has not yet been agreed upon. A small committee of representatives from Britain, France, Romania, Yugoslavia, Spain, and Greece will meet tonight to discuss and decide on this matter. Italian General Representative Aloisi visited French Prime Minister Laval tonight. Although no statement was issued, it is said that general issues were discussed, but no solutions were proposed. Aloisi will meet with British Foreign Secretary Hoare tomorrow. Eden is currently packing and plans to return to London on Saturday evening. (1st Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) During today's meeting of the eighteen-nation committee, the Canadian representative suddenly proposed a ban on the transportation of oil, oil products, coal, and iron to Italy and Italian territories. Representatives from Britain, France, and South Africa all strongly supported this proposal. This move would hinder Italy's colonial war more severely than attacks by the Abyssinian army on its lines of communication, as Italy does not produce the coal needed for transport ships, nor does it produce the gasoline needed for tanks and airplanes. The committee decided to transfer this proposal to the technical committee, but the attitude of non-member states is the main factor in this complex issue, so no decision will be made before mid-December.

<p>(Tokyo) Major news agencies across Japan and the Japan Broadcasting Corporation are attempting to establish a world-class international news agency in Japan. They have applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Communications for permission to establish a new corporate entity, the Allied News Agency. However, at that time, due to Minister of Communications Tokonami's inability to carry out the matter, the work of establishing a new news agency was resumed after Mochizuki took office as Minister of Communications. Recently, Minister of Communications Mochizuki, in view of the international situation, confirmed that establishing a powerful news agency is an urgent task at present. On the morning of the 2nd, at 11:00 AM, he invited representatives of major news agencies and news agencies nationwide to the Minister of Communications' official residence to explain the government's beliefs and request the cooperation of the representatives. Minister of Communications Mochizuki made the following points: "There is no need to elaborate on the reasons why it is necessary to strengthen the communications industry today. Former Minister of Communications Tokonami and Foreign Minister Hirota expressed this to you in May. Recently, a conflict has occurred between Italy and Abyssinia, and major news agencies around the world are very active. In view of the international situation, it is extremely important from a national policy perspective to unify the communications industry as soon as possible and realize its strengthening. This time, the national press and broadcasting associations are cooperating to organize a public interest corporation to establish a large news agency under the fairest conditions, which is a project that suits the current era. The government has now decided to approve its establishment. I hope that the national news and communications agencies will cooperate to make its plan a success." After Minister of Communications Mochizuki finished speaking, the Minister of Communications, Vice Ministers Aomoto and Ohashi, Participating Official Hirano, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau Shindo, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu, Director of the Information Department Amau, and others exchanged various opinions with the news representatives.

<p>(London) According to a statement released yesterday, the Governor of the Bank of England has established a committee to find ways to protect the interests of British holders of Chinese railway bonds and other bonds. This move is the result of British government economic advisor Sir Arthur Salter's visit to China. The committee consists of five members, chaired by Lord Alness. Today, The Times published an editorial stating that this move will surely be welcomed by many people in Britain who hold Chinese securities, some of whom are uneasy due to the large drop in Shanghai exchange rates. There have recently been suggestions as to whether action should be taken to protect their position. Financial News has learned that the organization of this committee is due to the fact that since President Roosevelt implemented his silver policy, one wave has followed another, and there has been no peace. The Bank of England's actions have been welcomed by all sectors in London. It should be stated that the Chinese bond market has not yet been shaken by the exchange rate market. The Chinese Committee will not be concerned with any possibilities regarding commercial loans, and will focus solely on protecting the position of bonds. The committee represents the interests of various large foreign bond investments. (2nd Reuters)</p>

<p>— Edited by Tang Qingzeng</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>The economic system is the center of society, and economic power is the driving force for promoting social progress. Today's world is almost entirely dominated by economic forces. If this problem cannot be solved, all complex and chaotic problems will have no way to start. Our country's current economic ills, such as the backwardness of industrial production, the collapse of agriculture, and the low purchasing power of the people, have become deeply ingrained, and dangerous signs have been fully exposed. As for Western countries, the deepness of the panic and tariff wars are not easy to handle and are closely related to our country.</p>
<p>China is currently in need of economic construction, so economic principles and facts are indispensable knowledge for the people of the country. The mission of this column is to use the power of words to promote economic knowledge and analyze reality, in order to arouse readers' interest in and accurate understanding of economic matters. This is one wish of this column.</p>
<p>The scope of this column generally includes: (1) explanation of various basic economic concepts, (2) explanation of modern economic organizations, (3) exploration of special economic issues, (4) investigation of economic conditions in various regions. The content and writing should be simple and accurate, and the materials should be new and complete.</p>
<p>We hope that enthusiastic readers will give this column fair criticism and guidance.</p>
<p>Investment by Wu Depei</p>
<p>In recent years, the rapid tide of the world economic panic has poured into our country. Industry and commerce have declined, the number of unemployed has increased sharply, the market has been sluggish, and floating capital has accumulated and stagnated. It is deposited in banks, and because the bank credit foundation fluctuates, it is not easy to lend money. Individuals and commercial organizations with accumulated cash have also shown an excess phenomenon, and they have to study investment together in order to obtain the benefits they deserve. Recently, due to the European and Asian situation and currency system rumors, public debt prices in this city have soared, and buyer appetite has been strong. This is a major turning point in the investment world.</p>
<p>(1) Characteristics of Investment</p>
<p>Investors put surplus funds into production channels (The Productive Employment of Capital) in order to obtain appropriate interest and enable the original principal to produce "reproduction" effects. The target of investment must be active production and in line with economic principles. Otherwise, investing useful funds in unproductive businesses is abandoning capital rather than investing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the special requirement of investment is the safety of the principal first. Prudent investors must first seek to protect their capital properly. They must not be obsessed with profit and haggle over the level of profit. They only seek current small profits and do not know how to measure future risks. Risks in the investment world are unavoidable, but precautions must be taken to reduce them. In advance, one should always silently observe the company's financial management, financial situation, market changes, bank operations, stock exchange reports, and political developments, all of which are closely related to invested funds. Investors do not need to be familiar with such specialized courses, but they should also know their basic outline.</p>
<p>(2) Investment and Speculation</p>
<p>The meanings and directions of investment and speculation are fundamentally different. The analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Investors often try to avoid danger, so the degree of danger can be reduced to a minimum. Speculators seek huge profits, all in the danger of being significant, so that they can sell short and buy long as they please.</p>
<p>(2) Investors hope to receive legitimate income and do not make extra, unreasonable ideas; speculators only want the principal to appreciate and gain more profit, the more the better, the better.</p>
<p>(3) The rate of return on investment is more regular, while speculation has more irregular income.</p>
<p>(4) When investing, buying and selling securities are mostly paid in cash, and the money and goods are immediately settled. Speculators like to short sell and buy more futures.</p>
<p>(5) Investors' buying and selling behavior is entirely based on statistics; speculators do not.</p>
<p>(6) Investors can accurately analyze market conditions and predict the occurrence of changes, while speculators do not value analysis and fear that there will be few changes.</p>
<p>(3) Development of Investment Opportunities</p>
<p>In all countries around the world, whether old or new, and in market conditions, whether prosperous or declining, investors only need to have sufficient funds ready to proceed. The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The increase in population and the concentration of rural people in cities has become a common phenomenon in various countries. Therefore, human needs are increasing day by day. The original industries should urgently increase production and expand their organizations, and new enterprises are emerging one after another. All of this requires huge capital to establish their foundations.</p>
<p>(2) The increase in the level of life. The more advanced the society, the richer human life becomes, and the types of consumer goods are constantly changing, and the quality and quantity are different from before. Manufacturers strive to adapt to the trend, and they must raise funds to enrich their content.</p>
<p>(3) The development of emerging countries. Not long after the founding of the country, everything is waiting to be done. The organization of politics is gradually perfected, and economic undertakings must follow. The development of colonies, the construction of agriculture, industry and commerce, the completion of transportation routes, and the extraction of minerals are all good opportunities for investors.</p>
<p>(4) Convenient transportation. The denser the network of lines on the map of inland rivers, inland seas, oceans, continents, aviation, and telegraphs, the larger the quantity of a country's import and export trade, and the closer the exchanges between importers, exporters, and financial institutions, and the more frequent the income and expenditure.</p>
<p>(5) Close international relations. Modern countries all know that the ancient closed-door policy is wrong, and they all pay attention to the strategies of international lending and mutual assistance. Therefore, bonds are issued and sold to foreign markets, or the capital of one country is gathered and invested in the production of other countries. There is communication between countries, and surpluses and deficits are mutually supplemented. International investment has become the central business of modern international relations.</p>
<p>(6) Compilation of commercial statistics. The success of investment lies entirely in accurate and complete predictions. All business cycles, the tightness of silver, and the changes in the market value of securities must be based on the Law of Probability and the Law of Average to project the future. In this way, the current capital investment will have a basis to follow and will not go astray.</p>
<p>Investors should be cautious throughout their lives, think carefully and silently observe, and wait quietly for a good opportunity. Do not let profit prevail and act rashly and risk everything.</p>
<p>(4) The Crisis of Investment</p>
<p>Market situations change unpredictably, and market prices rise and fall in an instant. Sometimes gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and sometimes silver is expensive and gold is cheap. The value of currency is also uncertain. Even if investors can use their intelligence and think carefully before acting, it is sometimes difficult to completely avoid the following risks:</p>
<p>(1) The risk of market price. Securities may increase or decrease, and capital may be more or less. Although there is a law of supply and demand as a guideline, the arrival of political and economic emergencies is rapid and serious, often making it difficult for investors to cope, and eventually leading to failure.</p>
<p>(2) The risk of commercial organization credit. Companies issuing company bonds or stocks often have poor turnover and cannot maintain themselves in the "unfavorable situation". The managers initially try to keep secrets and deceive themselves, but once they declare bankruptcy, it is like a bolt from the blue, harming themselves and others. If investors cannot predict and collect the securities they issue, they will inevitably be harmed.</p>
<p>(3) The risk of political organization credit. Public finances always lead to budget overruns, which cannot be compensated. The original lottery repayment method for public bonds may not be implemented, and market credit will plummet, even if it recovers.</p>
<p>(4) The risk of personnel. Wars, riots, and other events that disrupt social order can cause the stock exchange to stop trading, all industries to decline, and the market to collapse. What about investment? What about safety?</p>
<p>(5) The risk of natural disasters. Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and droughts all cause losses to the investment world, which cannot be resisted.</p>
<p>Where there is enterprise, there must be danger. Bank managers are busy signing contracts for securities futures every day, often tossing and turning in their sleep at midnight, all because they are responsible for significant and dangerous situations.</p>
<p>(5) The Cost of Investment Risk</p>
<p>The existence of risk in the investment world is normal, not an abnormal phenomenon. Because there are often risks, there must often be corresponding rewards to compensate for the losses and to reward the mental effort of avoiding risks. In terms of losses, it is like the profit of an entrepreneur, and in terms of mental effort, it is like the wages of a worker, but this reward should not be too high or too low. It should be considered in the middle to find a fair and safe way. The analysis of its composition is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) True Income. The interest on investment cannot be lower than the true income that should be received. If there is no income or the income is too little, investors will hesitate and market will lack capital, so interest rates must increase.</p>
<p>(2) Reasonable Profit. The interest on investment does not have to be higher than a reasonable profit, because businesses that use capital should also have a reasonable profit themselves. Investors who provide capital cannot infringe on this number. Otherwise, businesses will fear the high peak of interest and fear that they will work hard for nothing, and they will also hesitate. In this case, even if investors have capital, they will have few opportunities to release it. Heroes have no place to use their talents, and personal suffering is a small matter. The stagnation of social cash is harmful to industry and commerce. In fact, the interest paid by borrowers to lenders must be lower than the profits that should be earned, and the level of capital interest depends entirely on the earning power of the enterprise. Generally, an annual interest rate of 5% to 1.2% is considered a good standard, and an annual interest rate of 7% or 8% is a moderate and reasonable interest rate. Investors may not care about the safety of the principal, but otherwise this standard is essential. Therefore, since the establishment of the Republic of China, the domestic public bonds issued by the government, except for the special salt surplus treasury bills issued in August of the eleventh year with a monthly interest rate of 2%, the special tobacco and alcohol treasury bills issued in February of the tenth year with a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, and the autumn festival payment treasury bills issued in September of the twelfth year with a monthly interest rate of 1%, the special salt surplus treasury bills issued in May of the same year with a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, the Chongwenmen Jinpu freight donation special treasury bills issued in April of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China with a monthly interest rate of 1%, and the special salt surplus 14 treasury bills issued in January of the eleventh year of the Republic of China with a monthly interest rate of 1.5%, which have higher interest rates, and the financial long-term public bonds of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government in the seventeenth year, which have a particularly low annual interest rate of only 2.5%; in addition, the annual or monthly interest rates of various public bonds and treasury bills are all 6% to 8%.</p>
<p>(6) Rationalized Investment</p>
<p>Recently, countries have been competing to promote the policy of rationalization. All economic behaviors, such as production, consumption, trade, and distribution, have certain positive and perfect norms. Investors should pay attention to the following matters according to this principle:</p>
<p>1. Capital must be invested in productive undertakings. All other unproductive and uneconomic matters, even if the temporary interest is high, should not be moved by it, making reckless investments, and causing future worries.</p>
<p>2. Attention must be paid to the management and operating methods of those who use funds, because if one management is improper, the profit will be reduced, and the loss will be serious, even bankruptcy and closure.</p>
<p>3. The main purpose is to obtain true and reasonable income, and investors should not demand high interest.</p>
<p>4. The risk of enterprises that use funds should not be too great. Investors should be cautious everywhere and avoid risky and fierce opportunities. One must know that if danger occurs, good capital will inevitably be lost.</p>

<p>Han Was Ordered by Chairman Chiang to Persuade Him to Travel, and Sent a Special Car Prepared for Him to Ride South</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, Feng Yuxiang, member of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, has resided in Mount Tai since the 19th year. During this time, he once entered Chahar, and then returned to Mount Tai, again as a recluse. At first, he lived in the Five Sages Temple, then moved to Xiaowangzhuang, and also founded a primary school to cultivate future generations, advocating sericulture to enrich the people. When free, he indulged in books and sent his thoughts to writing. It has been almost five years since he set foot in the capital. This time, when the Sixth Plenary Session opened, Central Committee members Li Liejun and Chairman Chiang, etc., repeatedly urged him to attend the meeting in Beijing. Chairman Chiang also telegraphed Han Fuqu, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, to quickly start the journey. Han complied with the order. After learning about his intentions, he sent Guo Zhigang, advisor to the provincial government, to Taian on the morning of October 31, with a column of armored cars from Jinan, prepared for Feng to ride south. The car included a locomotive, a second-class car, two covered freight cars, and Liu Cunen, deputy captain of the second team of armored cars, with 60 guards, accompanied for protection. At 12:55 noon, they arrived at Taian Station. Guo Zhigang got out of the car, climbed the mountain to visit Feng, and asked about his travel plans. At 6:10 in the afternoon that day, Feng went down the mountain to the station. Those who accompanied Feng included Qiu Shanning, Feng's chief of staff, Zhao Yun, an attendant, and dozens of guards, led by Wei Fenglou. Also present were a messenger, Zhou Bai, the magistrate of Taian County, the director of the business tax bureau, and others who saw him off at the station. A company of soldiers from the 118th Regiment of the garrison was also guarding the station. Feng was wearing a blue cloth jacket and pants, blue socks, and black cloth shoes, with a black felt hunting cap. According to Feng, he said at the station, "I am going to Beijing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session because Chairman Chiang repeatedly telegraphed me to urge me, so I decided to go. At this time of national crisis, and with the urging of all parties, I cannot but go." After speaking, he started the car south at 6:30.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Han Fuju Telegraphs the Central Government Urgently Requesting Funds for Yellow River Bank Closing and Asks for Disaster Relief Bonds to Benefit Disaster Victims <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: After the plan for closing the Yellow River banks in Shandong Province was finalized, construction of the foundation for both the east and west dams started many days ago. However, due to insufficient funds, essential materials have not been purchased completely. Now that the weather is cold and the water level is low, it is the ideal time to close the banks. Therefore, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, telegraphed the Executive Yuan Economic Commission and Song Ziwen on the 30th, urging them to allocate funds for the bank closure project, stating approximately that 600,000 yuan was needed before November 10th, otherwise credibility would be lost, progress would be impossible, and there would be a risk of suspending work to await materials. Furthermore, considering that the weather is getting colder and the disaster victims urgently need clothing and food, he specifically telegraphed President Wang, Minister Kong, and Xu Shiying of the Relief Committee, requesting the swift issuance of disaster relief bonds with preferential allocation. The telegrams are recorded below: (1) "Respectfully addressed to Wang Jun, President of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: The disaster victims in Shandong Province are gathered and urgently awaiting relief. To cope with the current situation, I previously borrowed 700,000 yuan from banks for relief, which has been reported in a prior telegram. I have also received your esteemed telegram regarding the issuance of 20 million yuan in public bonds, which the Ministry of Finance is planning. I deeply appreciate the central government's concern for the serious disaster and its comprehensive plan for relief, benefiting the surviving population. I should have waited quietly for further instructions without repeated requests. However, millions of people in Shandong Province are crying out for food, and with the severe weather, we must provide both clothing and food to extend their lives. The previous loan has been used for emergency relief and the purchase of cotton clothing and is almost exhausted. Moreover, only one-tenth of the affected people have received this relief, and the number of those who are still suffering is incalculable. The provincial finances are extremely strained, and all resources have been exhausted. The only source of relief funds, such as salary deductions for civil servants and the diversion of land taxes, have been used as collateral for loans. At this critical moment of life and death, there is really no way to provide further assistance. With winter approaching rapidly, there will inevitably be combined suffering from cold and hunger, and people will be wandering everywhere. Not only will I, Fuju, be ashamed before my conscience, but it also seems contrary to the central government's intention to protect its foundation. Your Excellency, your hope is tied to the people, and your benevolence extends to all. I humbly beg you to have compassion for these surviving people and instruct the Ministry of Finance to swiftly issue public bonds and allocate them preferentially to Shandong Province to alleviate their suffering. In urgent anticipation of your orders, I am, your subordinate, Han Fuju, respectfully kowtowing, 30th, confidential civil seal." (2) "Respectfully addressed to the National Economic Commission in Nanjing: I previously received your telegram to continue allocating 200,000 yuan for the bank closing project, which has been handed over to the bank closing committee for use, and I have replied by telegram. However, the cost of purchasing the necessary materials is very high, and the amount previously allocated is far from sufficient. It is estimated that at least 600,000 yuan is needed before the 10th of next month to pay for the materials, otherwise credibility will be lost, progress will be impossible, and there will be a risk of suspending work to await materials. I respectfully request your commission to quickly allocate the funds to meet the urgent need and beg for a telegram in reply. Han Fuju respectfully kowtows, 30th, confidential implementation seal." (3) "Urgent, respectfully addressed to Commissioner Song Ziwen in Shanghai: The Dongzhuang Yellow River bank closing project has been actively prepared for two months. However, the cost of purchasing the necessary materials is very high. The funds previously allocated by the National Economic Commission have been almost exhausted. It is estimated that at least 600,000 yuan is needed before the 10th of next month to pay for the materials, otherwise credibility will be lost, progress will be impossible, and there will be a risk of suspending work to await materials. In addition to telegraphing the Economic Commission to continue allocating funds, I specifically ask my younger brother to instruct them to allocate the full amount as soon as possible to meet the urgent need. Your little brother, Han Fuju, respectfully kowtows, 30th, confidential implementation seal."</p>
<p>The bank closure project in Shandong Province has already started and is expected to be completed by next spring. The people of Juancheng previously submitted a request to the bank closure committee to employ disaster victims in exchange for relief. The engineering team of the committee considered that the affected counties were numerous and located at different distances, making it difficult to implement a uniform regulation. They proposed to limit the scope to the four nearby counties of Heze, Juancheng, Yuncheng, and Juye, and first telegraphed these counties to report the number of able-bodied male disaster victims and formulate work-for-relief measures. At a meeting of the bank closure committee on the 30th, the proposed measures were approved, as follows: (1) The project items, unit price for earthwork, work period, and the number of people required for each project will be determined separately by the committee based on the project conditions. (2) The committee will fairly allocate work based on the distance of each county from the construction site and the number of able-bodied male disaster victims. Disaster victims must not object. (3) Disaster victims must have a complete organization to facilitate command and communication. (4) The committee's supervisors have the right to temporarily increase the number of workers. If there is a risk of delay, the committee may suspend their work. (5) The committee is not responsible for the round-trip travel expenses of disaster victims to and from the construction site. (6) Disaster victims are responsible for building their own shelters. (7) Disaster victims are responsible for providing their own tools for work. (8) Wages will be distributed by the committee's site office to the disaster victim foremen or representatives. (31st)</p>
<p>Songjiang Telephones Requesting Exemption from Transferring Tinglin Water Police</p>
<p>Tinglin Town in the Seventh District of Punan is a prosperous town in our county. Recently, since the Yanggongmiao bandits robbed a car and the Xiahengjing watchtower was robbed of weapons, the local security situation has become increasingly tense. Robbery cases are frequently heard in nearby villages, causing considerable concern among the townspeople. Suddenly, news spread that the Second Platoon of the First Team of the First District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team stationed in Tinglin was to be transferred elsewhere. Everyone believed that the military strength in Tinglin was already extremely weak, and once they were transferred, the people would not be able to sleep peacefully. Therefore, local gentry Liu Jiji, Sun Bokui, Zhou Zhanqi, Jiang Yougu, Tie Jun, Dai Bingjun, Zhou Zhenxian, and others submitted a request to the county government to telegraph the Civil Affairs Department to exempt them from being transferred elsewhere. If a clear order has already been issued, they earnestly request that the order be revoked to maintain security.</p>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Chen Township, Fengbei</p>
<p>Li Dequan's family, located in Group Four, Jia Three, Douchuantan, Chen Township, Fengjing North, was robbed by more than ten bandits on the evening of the 28th of last month. Each bandit carried flashlights and sharp knives. They pried open the front and back doors and first went to the bedroom of his daughter-in-law, Li Yu's. When the woman shouted for help, she was stabbed in the right leg with a sharp knife, causing serious injury. The bandits fled with their loot. Liu Shutang, the head of the Second Sub-bureau, reported to the authorities and immediately rushed to the scene for investigation. He has already reported to the Public Security Bureau for a general search and arrest.</p>
<p>Jiading Jealousy-Motivated Murder and Body Disposal to Destroy Evidence</p>
<p>Zhu Lu's, a widow from Yanjia Temple in the Northwest Township, is 40 years old. She previously hired her cousin, Zhu Zengfu, to farm the land. They lived together day and night and developed an affair. Recently, she changed and hired Gu A'gen, dismissed Zengfu, and then became involved with Gu. Out of jealousy, Zengfu beat Gu with a steel bar one morning on October 4th. As a result, Gu and Zhu Lu's conspired to take revenge. On the night of October 27th, Zengfu was returning home from shopping at Zhujia Bridge. Gu A'tao ambushed him on the way and, taking him by surprise, used a hemp rope to tighten around his neck, dragged him, and hanged him on the triangular wooden frame erected by the nearby Land Survey Team. After he died, they buried him in a peanut field, hoping to destroy the evidence. Zengfu's wife, Shou Shi, noticed that her husband had not returned for several days. She learned that crab catchers had heard cries for help that night, and Gu A'tao had previously threatened to stab Zengfu to death. Knowing that something ominous had occurred, she reported the information to the Loutang Police Station for investigation. Wang Dacheng, the patrol chief of the police station, approved the request and dispatched police to arrest and question Lu's and Gu A'tao. They were sent to the County Public Security Bureau on the first day. Under interrogation by Zhu Cheng, the chief of the Judicial Section, both male and female initially denied the charges. After Zhu Cheng adjourned the court, he devised a way to induce them to confess from the side. Lu's revealed the truth, and the court reopened. Gu A'tao then confessed the aforementioned circumstances. The County Public Security Bureau reported the situation to the county government and instructed the Loutang Police Station to exhume the body north of Yanjia Temple. On the morning of the 2nd, County Magistrate Xu Cixuan, accompanied by officials and police, went to the village to examine the body.</p>
<p>Wuxi Establishes a Winter Defense Office</p>
<p>The county government of our county convened a winter defense conference at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 2nd). Xia Bishu presided over the meeting and decided on the following: (1) Following the precedent of last year, establish a general winter defense office, with two deputy directors. (2) The joint defense districts will remain as they were, with the addition of one deputy director, who will be the head of the local public security sub-bureau or the patrol officer of the directly administered sub-station. (3) The expenses required by the office will be jointly estimated by the security brigade headquarters and the Public Security Bureau, and then submitted to the county for approval by the province. (4) The winter defense office will be officially established on the 10th of this month. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<p>Changshu A Fire Brigade's Telephone Dispute</p>
<p>The Central District Fire Brigade in our city is affiliated with the Hui Ri Temple but is commercially run and lacks sufficient funds. To facilitate communication, a telephone was installed, connected to a branch line from the Zuijingge Branch Bureau on Temple Front Street. This has been the case for more than three years. The fire brigade also officially registered with the telephone company. Unexpectedly, one night, the telephone company suddenly cut and confiscated the line, and the telephone line of Zuijingge was also cut, causing public outrage. The fire brigade urgently convened a meeting, expressing extreme indignation. All members of the brigade are volunteers, and operating expenses are donated by merchants. The telephone company is also commercially run, and donating and installing free telephones to develop public services is not excessive. However, they have actually taken this action. Three points were immediately proposed and unanimously passed: (1) The telephone switchboard of Zuijingge and the branch switchboard in the brigade will be restored to their original state immediately. (2) Compensation will be paid for damage to the switchboard and telephone lines. (3) Before the matter is resolved, the telephone company will be responsible for all firefighting affairs. The head of the Public Security Bureau was appointed as the mediator that evening.</p>
<p>Nantong The Labor Service Corps Has Been Established</p>
<p>The Nantong New Life Movement Promotion Association's Labor Service Corps was established on the 1st. Xu Zhen and Jin Zonghua were elected as the director and deputy director, respectively. The entire corps is divided into 26 large teams to renovate the city appearance. The general inspection is scheduled for December 1st. They will also promote the movement to wear Nantong homespun cloth to curb social extravagance and regularly hold mass weddings.</p>
<p>Nanjing Central Trust Bureau Handles Insurance for Public Property</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Finance on October 28th of this year to investigate the Central Trust Bureau's handling of insurance for public property. Please instruct all agencies to open a list of public property and send it to the bureau. After being submitted to the National Government for instructions, it should be approved for implementation. I await your instructions to inform all agencies to investigate, and especially instruct the bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e53">A Humble Suggestion for Salt Administration Reform <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Li Youyi</p>
<p>(Continued from Part Two)</p>
<p>(2) Reduce the selling price in various sales areas to benefit the poor. Salt is a necessary food item, especially for the poor, who need it the most, as discussed earlier. Therefore, the selling price should not be too high to burden people's livelihoods. Moreover, the collection of price taxes has a fixed rate (referring to after the standardization of tax rates; if the tax rates vary greatly across the country, there will be excessive or insufficient drawbacks). Transportation costs can also be calculated based on distance. If merchants can obtain a net profit of seven or eight percent annually after all expenses, it seems sufficient. However, today's salt merchants are not like that. According to people in the salt industry, transporting salt from the production areas of Jiangsu Province to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River for sale can yield a net profit of more than one silver dollar per hundred catties (one dan). Their capital is only a little over ten yuan (including salt collection, tax payment, transportation costs, and all other expenses). If one uses 100,000 yuan of capital to transport and sell salt, one can obtain a net profit of more than 10,000 yuan annually, exceeding one percent weekly interest. This is only considering transporting once a year. The enormous profits cannot be ignored. If the government carefully reduces the selling price of salt, taking from the wealth of rich merchants and alleviating the poverty of the poor, the benefits to society would be significant. Merchants, with their large capital, have a substantial profit, so they will naturally be willing to comply. Moreover, salt is a major commodity trade, so the profit margin should be smaller than that of other small-scale businesses. Imposing heavy profits to harm the people is not advisable and is actually the ultimate principle of regulating the social economy. (3) Abolish exclusive merchants, reorganize salt sales regions, and allow people to freely recognize regions for buying and selling, to prevent light eating in remote areas and maintain the business of salt farmers in high-cost salt farms. Everyone knows the drawbacks of exclusive merchants, and abolishing them cannot be delayed, so there is no need to repeat them. As for the permit system, it is intended to make salt transport even and universal, which is not necessarily incorrect. However, the current sales areas were delineated by the previous Qing dynasty. Many years have passed, and the road situation has changed. Moreover, in recent years, rail transportation is vastly different from the past. The government should carefully investigate the salt sales regions set in the past, statistically analyze the production of various farms, examine the distance of roads, allocate salt quotas, reorganize the division of areas, and strive for a balance of supply and demand and suitable transportation. People should be allowed to freely buy and sell within the scope of each region. Then, the worry of light eating in remote areas and the threat of unemployment at high-cost salt farms can both be resolved. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Citizens and the Law (Part 1) <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Lectures to the National Public on October 30th and October 1st)</p>
<p>Lin Bin, Member of the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>Today, the topic I'm discussing is "Citizens and the Law." This topic can be divided into several points. First, let's talk about:</p>
<p>(I) The Meaning of "Citizen" and "People"</p>
<p>A nation is a collective body of human beings. Those who belong to this collective are called "people," and the entire body of people can also be called "nationals." Among the people, some do not have the right to participate in national affairs, while others do. This right to participate in political affairs is called the "right to participate in government." The right to participate in government is a right stipulated and granted to the people under public law, so it is also called "public right." The people who enjoy public rights are citizens. It can be seen that citizens are also people, but they are able to enjoy public rights more than other people.</p>
<p>Being all people of the same nation, why is there such a distinction among them? This is probably because among the people, some are not suitable to participate in government or manage national affairs. Therefore, they are not allowed to have public rights. The laws of various countries have the same intention, and there are often negative qualification restrictions for people who are not suitable to participate in government. Our China has also clearly stipulated this. For example, Article 7, Paragraph 2 of the "Regulations for the Implementation of Township and Town Autonomy" stipulates that those who have one of the following circumstances shall not have the right of citizenship: (1) those who have engaged in counter-revolutionary activities and have been convicted; (2) corrupt officials, unscrupulous bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry who have been convicted; (3) those who have been deprived of public rights and have not yet been restored; (4) those who are under guardianship; (5) those who use opium or its substitutes. If people have one of these circumstances, they naturally should not be allowed to participate in managing national affairs. Other people who do not have these circumstances may be allowed to have public rights. However, they must also go through a certain procedure. For example, Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the "Regulations for the Implementation of Township and Town Autonomy" stipulates that people of the Republic of China, regardless of gender, who have resided in a township or town area for one year or have a residence there for more than two years, are over 20 years old, and have been sworn in and registered, are township or town citizens and have the right to attend township or town meetings and to exercise the rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. According to this provision, people who obtain citizenship must also meet the following requirements: (1) they must be people of the Republic of China; (2) they must have resided in the township or town for more than one year or have a residence there for more than two years; (3) they must be over 20 years old; (4) they must have held the swearing-in ceremony; (5) they must be registered in the citizenship register by the township or town office. People who meet these requirements are township citizens or town citizens, and when a township meeting or town meeting is held, they can attend and exercise the rights of election, recall, initiative, and referendum. These four rights are all political rights, which are the four rights invented by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. People can attend citizens' meetings to exercise these four rights for matters of a county in the locality, and they can also attend the National Assembly or the National People's Congress to exercise these four rights for matters of the central government. This is the function of the so-called right to participate in government. Only citizens have this right, and other people are not allowed to enjoy it according to law. Therefore, there is a distinction between citizens and people. However, in terms of the proportion of the population, those who are not allowed to be citizens because of counter-revolutionary activities and other circumstances are ultimately a very small number. Although it is not possible for everyone to have citizenship in reality, considering the spirit of political participation by all, it is, of course, hoped that no one is not a citizen. Citizens should have a deep understanding of the laws of the country. Other people should also have the same understanding. Whenever there is no need to distinguish between citizens and non-citizens, I will use the word "people" to refer to them collectively. Now I will talk about:</p>
<p>(II) Why Does a Country Need Laws?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we must first divide it into two points: First, what is called a country? Second, what is called a law?</p>
<p>A country is a collective body of human beings, as mentioned above. This collective is different from other collectives. First, it must have a certain population. Second, it must have a certain territory. Third, it must have a certain sovereignty. Any collective of people residing within a certain territory under a single sovereignty is called a country. The number of people can be as few as tens of thousands or as many as hundreds of millions. There is no need for fixed restrictions. The land under the jurisdiction of a country is commonly called territory. Territory indicates the area in which a country exercises its sovereignty. Positively speaking, it can exercise its power over all people within its territory; negatively speaking, it can prohibit other countries from invading its territory and exercising its authority. As for the people, they can be ordered to comply, and at the same time, they are not subject to any power from the outside, which is the manifestation of national power. Therefore, people, territory, and sovereignty are the three elements that constitute a country.</p>
<p>Possessing these elements can be called a country. What is the purpose that a country wants to achieve? In the past, those who advocated individual liberalism believed that the purpose of a country was solely to maintain the personal freedom and property of individuals. However, because the protection of individuals was too thorough, production capital was concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, resulting in inequality in society. Therefore, some people said that the purpose of a country should be based on the interests of all the people, and not focus too much on the protection of individual interests. Modern countries generally follow this view, so the purpose of a country can be divided into four types: (1) Maintaining the survival of the country. To achieve this purpose, all matters related to diplomacy, national defense, and finance should be handled well. (2) Maintaining the security of the country. To achieve this purpose, all matters related to preventing bandits, thieves, and everything that could harm security should be handled well. (3) Defining the boundaries of rights and obligations. The relationship between rights and obligations between individuals or between the state and individuals must be clear to prevent disputes. (4) Promoting the culture of the country. Such as education, health, rescue, industry, transportation, transportation, etc., which are related to the interests of the people and cannot be undertaken by private forces, must be handled by the state. If a country can use these four purposes as its guiding principles for its activities, coordinate class conflicts, and seek the development of common social interests, then it is a good country. If it is the oppression of one class over another and a tool for maintaining the interests of a minority, then it does not conform to the true purpose of the country, and why should there be a country?</p>
<p>Laws can be said to be formulated in order to achieve the goals of the country. What are the goals of the country? People in the past and people today have different views. Therefore, the views on the nature of law are also inconsistent. In the past, those who advocated natural human rights believed that law was a rule that protected individual rights. Today, people believe that law is not to protect individuals, not to protect a certain class, but to maintain the interests of the entire society. This statement is more appropriate. To be more specific, in order to exercise its power, the state should have an organization of organs. The so-called organs can be divided into two types: one is the decision-making organ, where the will of the state is determined by that organ, such as the parliament or the National People's Congress. The other is the executive organ, where the will of the state that has been decided is executed by that organ, such as the monarch of a monarchy, the president of a republic, and other administrative and judicial organs. The organization and powers of these organs are determined by law. If there is no law, the activities of state organs will have no standards. From the perspective of the people, the rights and obligations of the people to the state and the rights and obligations between the people are very complex and must also be regulated by law. If there is no law, the rights of the people will not be guaranteed, and the obligations of the people will have no definite scope. Then, it can be said that the power of the state cannot be exercised and social order cannot be maintained. Therefore, where there is a country, there must be laws. Without laws, the goals of the country can never be achieved. From this, we can see the importance of laws.</p>
<p>There are many types of laws. Those that have been explicitly formulated are called statutory laws, and those that have not been explicitly formulated are called unwritten laws. Those that apply domestically are called domestic laws, and those that apply internationally are called international laws. Those that stipulate the principles for resolving matters are called substantive laws. Those that specify the procedures for applying laws are called procedural laws. The names are inconsistent due to different points of view. It is not possible to explain them in detail at this time. There are also the names of public law and private law. The standards for distinguishing between public law and private law vary among scholars. Some focus on the parties involved in the legal relationship. Any law whose content stipulates the relationship between the state or public groups and individuals is public law. Any law whose content stipulates the relationship between individuals is private law. For example, the constitution, administrative law, criminal law, and procedural law stipulate the relationship between the state and individuals, so they are all public laws. For example, civil law, company law, maritime law, negotiable instruments law, and insurance law stipulate the relationship between individuals, so they are all private laws. Others focus on the nature of the legal relationship as the standard for distinguishing between public law and private law. Any law whose content stipulates a relationship of power and obedience of one party to the other is public law. If it stipulates a relationship of equality between one party and the other, it is private law. These two different statements can only be used as a reference, because in this day and age, there is no absolute distinction between public law and private law. However, for the convenience of research, there are still the terms of public law and private law.</p>
<p>The constitution occupies the most important position in public law. The existence of a country must have a certain population, territory, and administrative organs. The administrative organs must exercise their ruling power for the country. Therefore, the scope of the country's territory, the ethnicity of the country's people, the organization and powers of the country's ruling organs are all explicitly stipulated by law. This type of law is also called the national law in a broad sense. Among them, the constitution stipulates the general principles, and the administrative law stipulates the details. Then, the constitution is the law that stipulates the principles of the organization and scope of activities of the country. The constitution has the strongest effect and is higher than ordinary laws. Laws that conflict with the constitution cannot be considered valid. The constitution cannot be easily amended. The organs and procedures involved in the amendment are also very different from ordinary laws. These two points are the characteristics of the constitution. Modern countries all have constitutions. Our China now has the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage, which is essentially a constitution. When the period of political tutelage expires and the constitutional government begins, there should be a five-power constitution. The draft of this five-power constitution has been drafted by the Legislative Yuan. As long as it is passed by the National Congress of the Kuomintang, it can be submitted for approval at the National Assembly in the future and promulgated for implementation.</p>
<p>Civil law occupies the most important position in private law. Matters such as the relationship between parents, children, siblings, and spouses, the procedures for organizing business groups and establishing legal entities, the relationship between various claims and debts, the state of rights on movable and immovable property, the inheritance of estates, and what kind of behavior can acquire rights and what kind of behavior should bear obligations are all stipulated in detail in the civil law. In the commercial field, such as companies, negotiable instruments, insurance, maritime affairs, banks, and trademarks, separate laws have been formulated, called special civil laws. All civil matters can be handled in accordance with these laws, and if there is a dispute, it can also be resolved in accordance with these laws. It has a close and important relationship with the organization of society and families, the increase of public interests, and the principle of equality between men and women. Most countries have civil laws. Our China has also formulated a civil law of 1,225 articles by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated it for implementation.</p>
<p>The above is the situation in which the state cannot do without laws, and a rough classification of laws. The following will discuss:</p>
<p>(III) The Status of the People in Law</p>
<p>The status of the people in law is different from the past and the present. Recalling the early days of mankind, in order to avoid the harm of poisonous insects and beasts, and to hunt for living materials in the forests and mountains, people had to gather together and seek a common life. The social life at that time was the so-called common labor and common enjoyment. There was no distinction of class, no difference between rich and poor, noble and lowly. Under this natural state of life, how to be equal and how to be unequal did not arise as a question. Later, society gradually developed, and human life progressed from hunting and animal husbandry to agricultural life. As a result, there was also a differentiation of classes in society, and it became a relationship of one class oppressing another class and controlling another class. The phenomenon of inequality became obvious. People who belonged to the dominated class, because of their simple knowledge, still thought that this phenomenon of class domination was natural and should be so. Therefore, they did not feel any dissatisfaction with the phenomenon of inequality. Later, society became more advanced, and human knowledge gradually increased. People had serious doubts about the unequal social phenomenon, thinking that it was caused by the power of the ruling class. Therefore, the call for human equality has spread throughout society since the 17th century. At that time, general natural scholars, such as Locke and Rousseau, further studied the equality rights of human beings and had the so-called theory of natural equality. This theory had a great impact on society at that time. The independence of the United States and the French Revolution in the 18th century were both precedents for breaking the phenomenon of inequality. As for modern times, the constitutions of general countries have provisions for equality rights. In our China, the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China in the first year of the Republic stipulated the equality of the people in the following words: "The people of the Republic of China are all equal, without distinction of race, class, or religion." The Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China also has such a provision, which reads: "The citizens of the Republic of China are equal in law, regardless of gender, race, religion, or class." Recently, the draft constitution of the Republic of China drafted by the Legislative Yuan has three articles on equality rights. One article states that "the people of the Republic of China are all equal in law." One article stipulates that "all ethnic groups of the Republic of China are constituent elements of the Chinese nation and are all equal." Another article stipulates that "the people of the Republic of China have equal opportunities to receive education." According to these provisions, all citizens, regardless of which ethnic group they belong to, are constituent elements of the Republic of China and are all equal. This is ethnic equality. Regardless of whether they belong to the propertied class or the proletariat, they should receive equal protection or punishment. This is class equality. Regardless of their religious beliefs, they are given equal treatment in law. This is religious equality. Furthermore, regardless of whether they are male or female, except for natural differences due to gender, their treatment in law is also the same. This is equality between men and women. From this, it can be seen that the status of the people in law is equal. All rights that the people can enjoy or obligations that they should bear do not differ due to differences in gender, belief, economic status, etc. As for what are the rights that the people can enjoy and what are the obligations that the people should fulfill, there are also provisions in the law. The following will discuss them separately. (To be continued)</p>

Twenty years later, he was promoted to Congressman. In 1931, he was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. In 1932, he was elected to his current position, with a term from 1933 to 1937. (Above by New Voice News Agency)</p>
<p>Philippine Representative's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman of the Philippine Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Delgado, delivered a welcome speech to the country after meeting with Garner. "U.S. Vice President Garner, Speaker of the House Beane, and the American press delegation have been invited by the Philippine government to attend the celebration of the establishment of the new Philippine government on the 15th of this month (November). This is enough to show the friendship between the people and governments of the United States and the Philippines. On the other hand, this invitation has a profound meaning. The Philippine government and people hope that they will get to know the administrative legislators who will reform Philippine affairs with the new government and understand the administration of the new government personnel in the Far East and on the island. As a result, the new government personnel will have convenience in legislation in the future. Garner et al. will not only travel to various parts of the Philippines, but also go to China and Japan for sightseeing. The inauguration ceremony of the new Philippine government personnel will be at the time of the establishment of the new government. After the new government personnel are guided by Garner et al., the Philippine government can consolidate its friendly relations between the major countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. The Philippine government and I sincerely celebrate the health of the National Government of China, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Chinese people." (New News Agency)</p>
<p>Silver Senator's Remarks</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reported that the famous American "Silver Senators" Wheeler and King arrived in Shanghai today (2nd) with U.S. Vice President Garner. They told news reporters that the American silver purchasing policy will continue. King even said that he expects the price of American silver to rise to US$1.29 per ounce. Wheeler claimed that he could not elaborate on the U.S. silver policy in a few minutes, but two points could be confirmed: the current policy will continue, and this policy is beneficial to the United States. The reason can be found in his speech on the issue. As for the sudden and tragic fall of the Shanghai silver dollar when the price of silver is still high, it should be known that Shanghai cannot be considered as China now. The American silver group is still seeking to recoin silver coins according to the ratio of 16 to 1 of the bimetallic standard. Managed currency is sufficient to cause a very harmful currency war. The way to avoid it is that the currency is based on metal. Now that there is insufficient gold in the world as a metal base, silver should also be used to assist it. He predicted that the currencies of major countries will restore the metal base. As for when it will be realized, it cannot be determined. Wheeler plans to stay in China for a short time when he returns from the Philippines to investigate the current situation of silver. However, the scope of the investigation will be determined temporarily. Wheeler visited China in 1927. Senator King also said that the silver policy is beneficial to the United States, but he could not elaborate on the reason due to the lack of time. He also said, "I know the impact of American silver purchases on China. Frankly speaking, most of the silver we purchase comes from China, but China should find a way to solve its own problems." In the past, King had a great influence on the United States' recognition of the National Government.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Most of the Rumors in the Market Are Inaccurate; The Municipal Authorities Strictly Suppress Them; Those Who Create Rumors Will Be Subjected to Military Law <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the exchange transactions of various exchanges have been fluctuating recently, and rumors have been spreading, causing public anxiety. In order to understand the truth, reporters inquired about the news from various parties of the authorities. The results showed that the reason for the recent fluctuations in various exchanges was actually caused by those who deliberately manipulate them for speculation and profit. The government has always adopted a prudent policy and has not taken any action. Moreover, the general national economy has been relatively good recently, and there are no difficulties in the financial situation. All kinds of rumors are inaccurate. The fact that the Central Bank stabilizes foreign exchange is particularly obvious. It is hoped that people will no longer be fooled by those who create rumors.</p>
<p>Suppressing Absurd Rumors</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the securities, gold, and grain markets in this city experienced chaos on the afternoon of the first day due to the news of the assassination of Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei. However, all three bullets that President Wang was hit were not fatal, and he recovered well after the surgery. The Sixth Plenary Session was still held as usual. Therefore, after the opening of the various exchanges yesterday morning, they all returned to the state of the previous few days, and all securities rose. The municipal authorities are strictly suppressing all kinds of absurd rumors from the outside world.</p>
<p>Three Rumor Creators Arrested</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that evil people in this city spread rumors. The Municipal Government ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and deal with the matter strictly. Recently, the Municipal Government was informed that the rumors were organized, and their purpose was to confuse people's minds and disrupt the market. It was also heard that the Public Security Bureau has arrested three rumor creators. Mayor Wu has ordered them to be handed over to the military law department of the garrison headquarters for strict investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>Cai Jingjun's Speech</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Cai Jingjun, Director of the Public Security Bureau, yesterday to ask about the public security situation in this city due to the many rumors. He replied that the bureau is responsible for maintaining public security in accordance with the mayor's instructions. It usually contacts the police authorities in the concessions to cooperate in clearing out reactionary elements and eliminating petty thieves. Therefore, although the market is very depressed, it can still be safely passed. Recently, the winter prevention season is approaching. The bureau has convened various branches and teams to prepare early in reference to the successful cases of winter prevention in previous years. Therefore, even if there are evil people spreading rumors in the market these days, they have not only failed to use their skills, but also been arrested by our long police yesterday. They are being interrogated severely and will be severely punished. I hope that the citizens will remain calm and not be confused by rumors. This is the most important thing.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Rent Reduction Association Appeals to the Sixth Plenary Session to Include Rent Reduction in the Agenda; Requests a 60% Rent Reduction to Relieve Suzhou Merchants <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Petitioning in Jinjing</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee believes that the market is depressed and industries and commerce are on the verge of collapse, and the entire rent reduction issue has not yet achieved concrete solutions. Therefore, after the representatives' meeting of the branch of each district on the 29th of last month, it was decided to send Zhang Qingyun, Li Ao Kui, Wang Jingdong, Wei Langxuan, Jin Chuxiang, Wang Hesong, Hong Songgang, Zheng Xiaolin, Ge Futian, and nine others to Jinjing to petition the Sixth Plenary Session, requesting a clear order for a 60% rent reduction. The 40% reduction will be used as flood relief funds for three months. After that, it will be enjoyed by the tenants. Now that the representatives cannot spare time, they drafted a submission to the Sixth Plenary Session yesterday, requesting that it be included in the agenda, and a clear order for rent reduction to relieve Suzhou merchants. The original text said, "Submitting for a request for a clear order for a 60% rent reduction, and use the 40% reduction for disaster relief, and rescue the victims. Our country's economy has been affected by the world's economic depression. Both rural and urban areas have gone bankrupt. This city has been traumatized since the Shanghai war and has not yet recovered. In recent years, due to the weak purchasing power of the people, prices have fallen, but the rent remains the same as before, which has trapped industries and commerce, and they cannot afford the burden. The number of people who have been forced to close down is increasing day by day. The number of unemployed people is more than tens of millions. Even more, there are those who have no way to make a living and have to take risks. The impact on social security is huge. If we do not seek relief urgently, the hidden worries for the future are unimaginable. In addition, there are frequent floods and droughts in various provinces, and the disaster areas are vast, with wailing everywhere. Therefore, we specially request that you give a clear order for a 60% rent reduction as soon as possible. Once the market recovers, the original state will be restored. We also plan to use all the reduced amount as disaster relief funds for a period of three months, and then it will be enjoyed by the tenants. We specially report the following situation, cherish the decline of industry and commerce in Shanghai to the extreme, the tragic situation of floods in various provinces, and quickly make a decisive decision to clearly order rent reduction to help disaster relief, so as to relieve the suffering of Suzhou merchants and benefit the victims. We cannot bear the eagerness to await orders, and we respectfully submit to the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Shanghai Low Rent Association, Winter,"</p>
<p>Compilation of the Main Text</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that since the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee launched the rent reduction campaign, it has been more than two years. Although efforts have been made to appeal, the owners have not understood the depression of the market and have maintained their prejudices to the extent that they have not been popularized. Although a small number of owners have been considerate of the difficulties of the merchants and have voluntarily reduced the rent, they are all in remote corners of the city. Therefore, there are countless lawsuits. In order to reduce the burden on citizens, the association has specially appointed volunteer lawyers to defend all sectors of society in court and obtain legal relief. In order to make all citizens in the city understand the rent reduction steps and legal procedures, the recent court judgments on rent reduction and the negotiations between the owners and tenants have been compiled into a booklet for reference by all sectors of society. Those who need this procedure can request it from the association.</p>
<p>South District Proposal</p>
<p>The South City District Rent Reduction Committee, in view of the fact that members were sent to the Fifth Plenary Session last year to petition, but a year has passed, although there are many enlightened and famous landlords who have reduced rents, there are also those who are waiting to see and even sue in court, and the tenants who are unable to take measures have increased their litigation burden before the rent is reduced. Healthy organizations, such as the Republic Road Rent Reduction Branch and Yuanlong Li, have been given two rent reductions by the landlords since last year, and the landlords also deeply hope that the ruling party will make a statement to resolve the losses of both parties in this delay. During the Sixth Plenary Session, after the unanimous decision of the merchant representatives of the entire South District, the association unanimously decided that Shen Xinfu, Zhu Tiwu, Wu Zaitang, and others, together with the Shanghai Rent Reduction Federation, would go to Beijing to make a painful appeal to the Sixth Plenary Session to reduce rents. It was also decided that before the promulgation of the rent reduction method, in order to save the city's appearance and maintain the status quo, new buildings would be paid at a 60% rent, and old buildings would restore the original amount six years ago. Once the market situation improves, the original state will be restored. It is also heard that the association has a volunteer legal team, and rent reduction cases can be legally protected. This afternoon at 2:00 PM, the association was notified by the Shanghai Rent Reduction Federation to convene a joint meeting of the rent reduction branches of all districts of the city at the Hai Ning Road Nan Lin Li Minsheng Primary School. All branches in the South District can send three members to participate.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reported that the Ministry of Communications will issue 10 million yuan of telecommunications government bonds, which were issued a few days ago, to borrow 6 million yuan from the banking community in this city to clean up old debts. It specially dispatched Zhou Wenduan, section chief of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, to come to negotiate. Shen Shuyu, director of the Postal Savings Bureau, assisted in the process, and discussed with the responsible persons of the China Communications and other banks. All expressed their willingness to accept and have negotiated a draft contract. However, some bankers went to Japan with the economic delegation and have not returned, so there is no concrete decision yet. The bonds will be printed by the Ministry of Finance, and they will probably be printed by the middle of this month. In the future, formal bonds will be used to redeem the advance subscription certificates that were issued earlier.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Sudden Increase in Overseas Sales of Chinese Silk: Prices Rise More Than Double, but Raw Material Shortages Force Some to Halt Production <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the overseas trade of Chinese silk has been greatly reduced due to the dumping of Japanese silk in European and American markets, resulting in a sharp drop in silk prices and silk merchants teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Now, since autumn, overseas sales of Chinese silk have gradually improved, and silk prices have soared. Raw materials in various regions are about to be exhausted. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Improvement in Overseas Sales</p>
<p>Overseas sales of Chinese silk have been sluggish for years. B-grade silk has fallen to below 400 national currency yuan per picul, a rare occurrence. Silk reeling is bound to lose money, making it impossible for silk factories and merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to maintain operations, and they are on the verge of bankruptcy. In Shanghai, out of 113 single and double palace silk factories, only about one-tenth can barely maintain operations. Since the autumn of this year, Chinese silk has suddenly become active in European and American markets, and foreign firms stationed in Shanghai are purchasing Chinese silk, which has caused silk prices to rise slightly. B-grade silk has risen to about 500 national currency yuan per picul, and silk factories have also started operations one after another.</p>
<p>Soaring Silk Prices</p>
<p>Exports of Chinese silk gradually increased in July, August, September, and October, and by October, they had returned to their previous state. Prices have also risen accordingly. B-grade silk currently costs 840-850 national currency yuan per picul, more than double the previous price, which has not been seen since 1930. Silk factories and merchants in various regions have made large profits. It is said that Yongtai in Wuxi and Baotai in Shanghai are the largest. At the same time, cocoons and waste materials have also risen in price. The number of silk factories starting operations has suddenly increased, and exports of double palace silk are also gradually booming. The Fulun Heng Double Palace Factory on Tianbao Road in Hongkou has also leased the Honglun Double Palace Factory on Liuying Road in Zhabei to start operations.</p>
<p>Raw Material Shortages</p>
<p>Farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have seen the decline in overseas sales of Chinese silk, which has led to a sharp drop in silk prices. Cocoon prices have fallen to about 20 national currency yuan per picul. Each time they raise silkworms, there is no profit to be made, so they have to convert mulberry fields to grow other agricultural products, which has greatly reduced cocoon production. Since the autumn of this year, after the improvement in overseas sales of Chinese silk, there has been a significant shortage of raw materials. Silk factories with smaller capital have been forced to stop production due to lack of raw materials.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Sea Defense Liner "Haiyi" Ship Faces Navigation Issues; Hong Kong Government Nitpicks International Safety Certificate <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The "Haiyi" ship was newly purchased from abroad and has a very large load capacity. Although the ship is relatively old, the construction is still very solid. Previously, at the request of sugar merchant Zheng Zenan and others, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) was entrusted with transporting goods in Beihai, Haikou, and Sanbu, so it was agreed with the Chinese merchants to operate the "Haiyi" ship on the Shanghai-Fangcheng route, carrying passengers at the same time. However, when passing through Shantou and Hong Kong, it was necessary to apply for three documents, including an international safety navigation certificate and a radio certificate, before the Hong Kong government would allow it to carry passengers in and out. At the time of the maiden voyage, after various negotiations, the certificate was finally obtained. The international navigation safety certificate for Chinese seagoing vessels, in addition to the China Merchants’ "Four New" ships, only this "Haiyi" ship possessed it.</p>
<p>Failure to Pass Re-Inspection</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when the "Haiyi" arrived in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government verified the safety certificate but required a re-inspection to determine whether it met the various conditions listed on the safety certificate. After the Hong Kong government sent a surveyor to inspect the "Haiyi" ship, it was discovered that there were only sampans on the deck, not lifeboats, and the life jackets on board were also deemed insufficient. Other items such as the deck and cabins did not conform to the international navigation safety certificate. Therefore, they were nitpicking and unwilling to compromise. As a result, the "Haiyi" was deemed not suitable for navigating international ports and carrying passengers and could only be used as a cargo ship.</p>
<p>Major Repairs Require Huge Expenses</p>
<p>After this re-inspection, the Hong Kong government refused to issue a passenger license, which meant that it could not operate at various seaports abroad. If it was necessary to continue sailing, major repairs would have to be carried out, and the instructions of the Hong Kong government's surveyor had to be followed. The repairs had to be carried out at a Hong Kong shipyard, but according to the major repair plan set by the Hong Kong government, the required repair costs and various modifications would cost at least 100,000 yuan. Currently, the Chinese Merchant Shipping Company is still considering this.</p>

We are sending it now and asking you to forward it to the Flood Relief Association. We are very grateful. Sincerely, All Students of Wuguan Elementary School, November 1st.</p>

<p>The Chinese Economic Inspection Delegation to Japan, consisting of more than 30 people, led by head Wu Dingchang, crossed the sea on the 6th of last month. Except for some members who have returned to China one after another, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, and others returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Head Wu will depart in two or three days. Details are recorded below:</p>

<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Maru of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (日本郵船會社) left Japan on the 31st and arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 3 p.m., berthing at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. When the ship docked, the welcoming personnel went aboard together and met with Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, and others on the deck, shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries.

<h3 id="e67">Japanese Inspection Delegation Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday and Visited the Construction in the City Center <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Economic Inspection Delegation organized by the Japanese Telegraphic Communication Company (日本電通社), a group of 14 people, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. Yesterday morning at around 10 a.m., they visited Japanese Ambassador to China Arigi Akira, Consul General Ishii Jotaro, Commander Araki of the Marine Corps, and Sugimoto, head of the Japanese Residents' Association, in succession. Then they paid a visit to Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city and visited the construction in the city center. At 5 p.m., they attended a tea party hosted by Ambassador Arigi at the Ambassador's residence on Bixun Road. At 7:30 p.m., they also attended a banquet hosted by Mayor Wu at Xinghualou (represented by Wang Changchun, a special commissioner of the municipal government).

<h3 id="e68">Central Cooperative Research Class: Visiting Group Arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou Yesterday; Visited Shanghai Today and Will Go to Hangzhou Tonight; The Group Published Their Impressions of the Inspection Along the Way <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Cooperative Research Class of the Organization Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, in order to observe the actual experience of cooperative enterprises in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, specially organized a visiting group to conduct on-site inspections in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas. The group consisted of more than 30 members, led by Chen Zhongming as the general leader. They departed from Nanjing on the Beijing-Shanghai train on October 27th. They passed through Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Zhenze, and got off the train to visit various places. On November 1st, after visiting the Guangfu Cooperative Experimental Zone in Wuxian County, they took a train to Shanghai to inspect cooperative enterprises. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The group first sent Tang Naixin, a member of the public relations section, to Shanghai the night before last to make arrangements. Yesterday morning, the entire group of more than 30 members, led by the general leader, arrived in Shanghai. After contacting party, government, and educational institutions, they decided to depart this morning to visit the Yutang Cooperative in Shanghai County. Tomorrow morning or tonight, they will go to Hangzhou and then to Jiaxing and Huzhou to visit. They are scheduled to return to Nanjing from Hangzhou via the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway on the 6th.</p>
<p>Cooperative Conditions in Various Places</p>
<p>Chen Zhongming, the general leader of the group, talked about the conditions of cooperative enterprises in various places yesterday: (1) Zhenjiang Xin'an Credit Guarantee Cooperative is the only new-style credit cooperative in Jiangsu Province. At the beginning of its establishment, it was due to the advocacy of Mr. Jin Zhiren, the business director of the Bank of China in Zhenjiang. Therefore, its capital operation relies heavily on the Bank of China. The guarantee liability of the cooperative is only three times the amount of the shares. The members are very enthusiastic about the cooperative affairs. If they can further adapt to training, improve their various knowledge, and consider increasing their guarantee liability, so that it can be guided by the organization and then operated independently, its future development is limitless. (2) Wuxi Chaomi Bang Rickshaw Utilization Cooperative and Consumer Cooperative are both established under the guidance of the Jiangsu Provincial Educational Institute and the Public Education Hall. The rickshaw cooperative has 20 members and currently has 10 vehicles. The members take turns pulling the rickshaws, and they are full of vitality. The funds for purchasing the vehicles were borrowed from private individuals who are enthusiastic about cooperation. However, private power is ultimately limited, and local financial institutions, especially the Farmers Bank, should not shirk their responsibility to encourage and promote them. In addition, due to the difficulty of purchasing vehicle licenses, the number of members in the cooperative cannot be increased. However, for the sake of development, it is advisable to add probationary members and try to add new vehicles. On the one hand, prepare for the situation where members cannot pull the rickshaws due to other matters, so as to avoid the malpractice of temporarily finding non-members to pull the rickshaws. As for the establishment of the consumer cooperative, although it has been less than a month, the results are quite impressive. If it is possible to find ways to directly connect with producers in terms of purchasing goods, its business will be more progressive. (3) Kai Xian Gong Raw Silk Refining, Transportation, and Sales Cooperative has a long history of struggle. Although it has suffered a lot of losses due to the drop in silk prices, it can still cope with the difficulties and repay the loans. The processing part of the cooperative is undertaken by the family members of the members, and their spirit is also very good. (4) Guangfu Cooperative Experimental Zone was originally jointly organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction and the China Cooperative Society. It has been operating for several years with little success. On July 1st of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specially entrusted the China Cooperative Society to fully design and guide it. After the China Cooperative Society took over, it organized a guidance committee for the experimental zone, and under it, it established a design committee and implemented rectification matters. The original 23 silkworm raising cooperatives have been sorted out and are now undergoing the reorganization of the joint cooperative. The day the group visited happened to be the day the joint cooperative held its representative conference. There were 105 member representatives and a small number of peasant women serving as representatives. The hardship, difficulty, simplicity, and longing of the representatives can truly express the suffering of the entire Chinese countryside and the need for cooperative enterprises.</p>

<h3 id="e70">City Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Telegram Requesting Strict Prohibition of Shaoxing Deducting Foreign Exchange Premiums on Central Bank Notes <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent another telegram yesterday to the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that the Shaoxing money industry be stopped from deducting foreign exchange premiums on banknotes issued by the Central Bank and other banks. The telegram stated: (Title omitted) On the 1st of this month, the Foil Industry Association sent a letter stating that in the reply from your association on August 10th, No. 2920 of Pu Zi, it was mentioned that the Shaoxing money industry was deducting premiums on banknotes issued by the Central Bank and other banks. The Ministry of Finance was requested to stop it. On the 10th of this month, the Ministry of Finance issued a reply, No. 6606 of Qian Zi, which stated that they had received the telegram and had instructed the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance to instruct the Shaoxing County Government to investigate and strictly prohibit it. The letter was recorded and notified to all members of our association. Now, according to reports from members of our association, the Shaoxing money industry has dared to defy the orders of the Ministry and still deducts the premium (secretly called foreign exchange premium) of 17 or 18 yuan per thousand yuan of banknotes issued by the Central Bank and other banks from the industry when they go to Shaoxing to purchase goods. It has been more than a month since the premium was raised to more than 20 yuan. Observing the current situation, it will gradually rise in the future. Since June of this year, the industry has suffered additional losses due to the foreign exchange premium. Please send another telegram to the Ministry of Finance to fight for it. Accordingly, the affiliated association has re-examined and verified the facts. The facts are hereby conveyed. We respectfully request your association to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Government Department of Finance, and strictly order the Shaoxing County Government to investigate and prohibit the deduction of foreign exchange premiums on banknotes issued by the Central Bank and other banks, so as to maintain national law and avoid additional losses for merchants. The attendees checked the matter and found that it had been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for instructions to prohibit it. Now, according to the report from the association, the local money industry not only resists orders as before, but also increases the foreign exchange premium. This is foolish for the national law and increases the burden on merchants. Once this example is set, there will be no end to it. The monetary system is concerned, and it should not be allowed to be perfunctory. We should send a telegram to the Ministry and the Provincial Government for review and approval, and strictly order the local government to stop it, which is for the public good. Shanghai Koutou.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Zhenwu Commissioner of the Red Swastika Society Reports on the Disaster Situation in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Red Swastika Society believed that the flood disaster in northern Jiangsu was severe, and had publicly appointed Zhenwu Commissioners Chen Wangqiu, Zhu Weiyi, Tang Fuyun, and Liu Foyuan to go to various counties in Xuhai to investigate the disaster situation, and at the same time raise Zhenkuan (relief funds) to prepare for the purchase of grain and medicine to be transported to the disaster area for relief. It is now heard that the Zhenwu Commissioner of the office has personally gone to various disaster areas to conduct on-site investigations of the disaster situation, and has submitted a detailed report, which is recorded as follows: Pei County is 120 li (Chinese miles) away from Tongshan, connected to the northern Jiangsu levee. When the levee broke, the county was the first to bear the brunt. Initially, the second district was flooded, and then the flood spread to five districts. The flood came suddenly, and the people were caught off guard, and countless people were drowned. On the 26th and 27th, there was wind and rain, and the flood rushed straight to the northeast earthen city of the county, which was extremely dangerous. The east, west, and north gates were blocked to prevent water from pouring in, leaving only the south gate for access. Now, the waves are surging, and there is no end in sight. Transportation is cut off. Xun and others had to turn back midway. Pi County: On the 29th, they took the Longhai train to Pi County to investigate. When the train arrived at Daxu Station, they saw that the north of the railway was flooded with several feet of water. After advancing several li, the Tongshan boundary merged with Pi County, and the north and south of the railway were flooded. Villages were submerged, and houses in high places were trapped in the water. Houses in low places collapsed and flowed away with the waves. The scene was so tragic that it made people's hearts ache. From Daxu east to Pao Station, heading north for 156 li, the north and south of the railway were boundless. From Yunhe Station to Guanhu Town, advancing by land and water, they finally reached the county seat. The county is divided into seven districts. The disaster situation in the third, fourth, and fifth districts is the most serious, followed by the sixth district, and then the first and second districts. There is no disaster in the seventh district. Many disaster victims have fled. The county has set up two shelters, one on the Gaogang in the north of the city and the other on Suyang Mountain. There are about 3,000 refugees who have not been taken in. They are all temporarily built thatched huts. The disaster victims are all emaciated. Usually, the people of the county mostly eat red grain. Even the third-class noodles are regarded as treasures. When they returned along the original road, they took a train to Xinpu, and it was already late at night. Donghai County: Because the water at Wuhua Bridge rose and the Wanggong River levee broke, the towns in the second district were completely submerged. The first district, from Xiapu to Dapu Xinpu, and the area south of the railway, became a swamp, 30+ li wide from southeast to northwest and 120+ li long from north to south. There are about 20,000 disaster victims. Guanyun County: The areas around Daxiao Luhuzhuang in the second district of the county, as well as the Honggou Chekou Daxiao Maozhuang area in the first district, to Fenghuang Town, are all flooded. The disaster victims have no clothes and no food, and the situation is too terrible to witness. Shuyang County: Due to the turbulent water at Liu Lao Jian, the ninth district, from Yangkou to Machang, is about 20+ li from east to west, and from Wuji to Zhou Shenji in Lianshui County is about 50+ li from north to south, with several feet of water. It is still rising. The above counties have been personally investigated. Suqian and Lianshui in Huaishu, and Feng County in Xushu, have not yet been investigated. For this Zhenwu, Xia Pi and Pei County should be started from in Xushu, and Shuyang should be started from first in Haishu. Red grain should be used for Zhen in Xushu, and taro rice should be used for Zhen in Haishu. Both can be purchased in the respective counties. Red grain costs about 4 yuan per market dou cao, which is 150 jin (Chinese pounds) per dan. Corn costs about 3.5 yuan per 100 jin. It is now autumn, and the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold. Winter is coming soon, and there is a risk of freezing and starvation. I sincerely hope that the general office will make a call to action, awaken the sympathy of all sectors, and provide benevolent syrup and righteous grain to save the dying disaster victims. I bow my head nine times to ask for the lives of the disaster victims.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Xu Renguang Narrowly Escapes Abduction <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Incident Occurs in Cihui Nanli; Brown Car Used with Forged License</p>
<p>Xu Renguang, a native of Huzhou, is 36 years old and lives at 24 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. His sister, Xu Renyi, is the principal of the Zhirenyong Girls' School in this city. Some time ago, Xu Renyi went abroad to study, so she entrusted the school affairs to Xu Renguang to manage. Renguang had a new-style Henderson sedan, license number 5116, which he drove himself, using it as transportation every morning to go to the school for work. Yesterday morning around 9 a.m., Xu drove to the school. Because Weihaiwei Road near the corner of West Miller Road, near the school, was under construction and vehicles were prohibited from passing, he changed his route and drove into Cihui Nanli. He got out of the car in the last lane of the lane. Just as Xu was getting out of the car, a brown old sedan was parked next to the last lane, with three people in the car. One seemed to be a driver, and the two men were sitting in the back, wearing gray robes. As soon as they saw Xu Renguang getting out of the car, the two men jumped out of the old car at the same time, blocking Xu's path. They took out handguns, warned him not to make a sound, and forcibly dragged Xu into the brown car. At that time, Xu Renguang knew that he had encountered bandits. Knowing that he could not resist, he had no choice but to obey and get into the car. The bandit in the front drove the car out of the lane and headed west on Foch Road. At the same time, the bandits took out a pair of black glasses and ordered Xu to put them on his nose. Before long, the car arrived at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Rue Massenet. The bandits suddenly said to Xu, "You have to go to Rue Poncet to see our commander." They ordered the bandit driving the car to turn and head towards Rue Poncet. When they arrived at the intersection, the car stopped. The two bandits then pushed Xu out of the car. Just as he was about to step down, Xu Renguang saw that the bandits' guard was slightly lax. He desperately jumped out of the car and ran wildly, shouting kidnapping and help along the way. At that time, there were many people coming and going on the road. The bandits, seeing that the matter had been exposed, dared not chase him. They hurriedly jumped into the bandit car and fled west. By the time the Yue patrol officer No. 609 nearby heard the alarm and arrived, it was too late. He escorted Xu Renguang back to the police station. But at this time, the French police had already received a report from the Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Public Concession. When Xu Renguang was kidnapped, it happened to be seen by a Zhu surname tenant in No. 22, who recorded the bandit's car license plate as 4753 and reported it to the police station by telephone. Therefore, after Xu reported the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station sent a detective to take Xu back, inquired in detail about the bandits' clothing and appearance, sent him back to his residence, and notified the city's police agencies to track down the car. Until around 11 a.m., the car was discovered by a patrolling western police officer at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. There was no one in the car. He returned to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, drove the car into the police station, carefully examined the traces in the car, took photos for file, and investigated the car license result. It was discovered that it was a forgery. At the same time, it is still under investigation whether the car was robbed by the bandits.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Zhabei: Daylight Robbery at Huang Yichu's Home on Ouyang Road <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The security team police engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits, resulting in the capture of three bandits alive and the killing of one. They seized one pistol and seven bullets. The homeowner's estimated loss is over 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday around 10:00 AM, a major robbery occurred at the home of Huang Yichu, a Cantonese tea merchant, located at No. 10 Ouyang Road, Zhabei. The loss is estimated to be over 10,000 yuan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Incident: Huang Yichu, a tea merchant from Guangdong, purchased land on Ouyang Road, under the jurisdiction of the Linping Road Police Station in Zhabei, and built a Western-style house. It was surrounded by bamboo fences and had a small garden, making it exquisite and beautiful. Recently, Huang returned to Guangdong for business, and his son, Ke Ming, also went to Hankou for business. Only six or seven people, including women, children, and maids, were left at home to guard the property. Unexpectedly, around 10:00 AM yesterday, Huang Yichu's wife, Fan Changdi (i.e., Mrs. Huang Fan), went out to buy food. Suddenly, three bandits in Western suits and one bandit in a Zhongshan suit, a total of four, claiming to have come from Nanjing to Shanghai to see Mr. Huang, broke into the living room. The three bandits drew their pistols and drove all the women, children, and maids into the west wing, tying them up one by one with ropes. Two bandits held guns to scare them and prevent them from making noise, monitoring their movements. The other two bandits went upstairs, rummaging through boxes and chests, looting all valuables and escaping.</p>
<p>The Pursuit and Capture of the Bandits: When the bandits went to rob, the newspaper delivery man had not yet arrived. The bandits pulled the wire bell outside the fence for a long time, but no one opened the door. At that time, Qu Huaili and Chi Wuqin, squad leaders of the Fifth Team of the Shanghai North District Security Corps, happened to see this and secretly suspected something. However, they dared not do anything. After the bandits entered the house, they heard the sound of a child crying inside, increasing their suspicion. Still, they dared not act rashly. Chi rushed back to the team to report to Deputy Team Leader Song Shouming. However, the location was about two miles away from the Fifth Team headquarters. After receiving the report, Song instructed Chi to rush to report to the Jixiang Road Police Station under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, Song led the team members to the scene, arriving around 10:45 AM. The bandits had been searching for about an hour and were leaving. At this time, Qu heard shouts from inside and realized that they were indeed robbers. After the four bandits left the house, they fled wildly towards the countryside of Quanjiazhai. Qu chased after them, and the bandits fired their pistols along the way as they fought and fled. By the time they reached Quanzhai, one bandit had run out of bullets and threw his pistol into the river, surrendering. At this time, Fang, an officer from the Jixiang Road Police Station, and Niu, the director of the Linping Road Police Station, arrived one after another, returning fire. The sound of gunfire continued incessantly as they chased for five or six miles. One bandit stood his ground to fight at the former Liu Family Residence, but Qu dodged into a nearby manure pit and shot the bandit in the back. The bullet exited through the front chest, and the bandit could not stand and fell into the riverbank. Qu rushed forward and seized a six-inch nine-shot Browning pistol, serial number 260, with seven bullets remaining. Another bandit was also captured, but he had discarded his pistol along the way. In total, three bandits were captured alive, and one was killed. A portion of the stolen jewelry was recovered and handed over to the Jixiang Road Police Station, along with the people and the loot, and transferred to the Linping Road Police Station.</p>
<p>Names of the Bandits: The bandits captured alive are Chen Biao, 28 years old; Wu Chunshan, 25 years old; both claiming to be from Hunan. The other bandit is Chen Hongsheng, 24 years old, from Hangzhou. The bandit who was killed was named Wang Ying, 24 years old, from Ningbo. The deceased was wearing a blue serge Western suit, a yellow shirt, and dancing leather shoes. There were four characters written horizontally on his chest: "Class B 26". There was another four-character phrase that looked like "athlete". The police station under their jurisdiction has instructed the local bailiff to report to the Shanghai District Court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>List of Lost Items: (1) Two jade bracelets, two pearl rings with diamonds, three jade rings, one jade bead, two jade buttons, one jade brooch, one gold pocket watch, over two hundred pearls, over ten loose jade beads, one ruby ring, one gold ring with a name engraved on it, ten yuan in paper money, three yuan in cash, and six jiao in small bills.

<h3 id="e76">The Truth About the Xu Dawu Jumping Case Unveiled: <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Embarrassing Situation of Those Without Money for Prostitution. The Defendant Pimp Faces Charges of Coercing Murder.</p>
<p>Xu Dawu, a fortune-teller from Changzhou, whose business was named "Zhejiang Mo Huqi," and Zhong Yan, a local mute colleague, went to the Tianyunlou of the Wing On Company on the night of the 31st of last month to play. They enticed Li Xiuying and Wu Gendi, two waitresses from the fashionable theater, to the Lixing Inn at No. 341 Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession, opening rooms 5 and 8 to engage in illicit relations. They agreed to pay each woman three yuan the next morning. When the time came, they had no money to pay. The mute escaped first. The two women then called their pimps, Zhang Fusheng and Chen Yongxing, to come and reason with Xu, demanding payment. Xu, in desperation, jumped out of the window of the third floor of the Lixing Inn to escape, suffering a head injury and dying instantly. The inn reported to the police, who sent detectives to arrest the two women, Li and Wu, along with their pimps, Zhang and Chen. Xu's body was sent to the morgue for an autopsy. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, no family members of the deceased were found. Yesterday at noon, Judge Wang, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, along with a forensic doctor and clerk, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Qin Youyu, the detective in charge of the case, and Bao Tan Yao Zhupo, brought the four male and female defendants to the scene. After the judge and others finished the examination, they sat in court. Bao Tan first reported the case. Yu Shofu, the tea boy at the Lixing Inn, testified that Zhong Yan came first and stayed in the account room for two nights. Xu came on the night of the 28th, and they opened a room together. On the night of the 31st, Xu and the mute brought two women and opened rooms 5 and 8. The next morning, the mute got up and said he was going out for business, instructing me to get money from Xu. When I asked Xu for money, he had no money and tried to pawn his clothes, but he couldn't. So, Gendi went to call our men to demand payment. He said nothing. When a big man came, the deceased ran to the balcony and jumped down to his death. But I didn't see him jump. Li Xiuying testified that she was a waitress and didn't know the deceased or the person who escaped. They came for tea twice. That night, the two of them came to the Wing On Company for tea, giving us four jiao. At eleven o'clock, they asked Gendi and me to go out for refreshments, so we followed them to the inn. After eating, they asked us to stay overnight. We replied that our families were poor and that we needed money to stay overnight. They said they had eighty yuan deposited with the landlady (i.e., the innkeeper) and would take it out the next morning, giving each of us three yuan. We believed them. I slept with the deceased, and Gendi slept with the one who escaped. At seven o'clock yesterday morning, the one who escaped got up and said he was going out for business, instructing me to get money from the deceased. When I asked the deceased for money, he had no money and tried to pawn his clothes, but he couldn't. So, Gendi went to call our men to demand payment. He was silent and wanted to hit him, but I stopped him. Later, a big man came, and the deceased ran out to the balcony and jumped down to his death. But I didn't see him jump. Wu Gendi's testimony was the same as Li's. Zhang Fusheng and Chen Yongxing testified that Chen was in front, and Zhang was behind, going upstairs to ask the deceased to come downstairs to talk outside. There was no coercion or anything like that. After reviewing the testimonies, Prosecutor Wang determined that Xu Dawu had indeed died from a fall. The body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuantang for photographs and burial. The defendants were investigated and handled by the police department. After the examination, the deceased was placed in a coffin by the charity. The defendants were taken back to the police station by the detectives to await prosecution and trial in the Second Special Court on Monday. It is said that the police will prosecute the defendants for coercing murder.</p>

<p>A Reed Mat Shed Suddenly Caught Fire, and Two Children Died Tragically.</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a reed mat shed in the courtyard of Peng Qu, a woman from Yancheng (31 years old), at No. 10, Shiza Gate, Jiqingfang, Rihui Bridge, Nanshi, suddenly caught fire, almost causing a conflagration. Fortunately, it was extinguished immediately, preventing a disaster. Zhou Debao, a chauffeur from Nanjing and tenant in the house, had already gone out, leaving only his four-year-old daughter, Xiaosanzai. She was with Dasanzai, the daughter of Li Zengshan from No. 11 next door. Both were burned by the fire. Xiaosanzai died of serious injuries, while Dasanzai was taken to the hospital by her father, but also died because she could not be saved in time. Afterwards, Zhou and Li took Peng Qu to the Ximen Branch Bureau to file a complaint. Because the case was related to a fire, they were ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Reaction to Telephone Price Increase: Expert Committee Plans to Study Calculation Methods <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Excessive Pricing for Extra Calls, Inappropriate Standards for Basic Calls.</p>
<p>Since the expert committee submitted the issue of the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase to the Municipal Council, its summary has been published in various newspapers. Most users, such as shopkeepers and residents, have expressed dissatisfaction. A committee member from the Nanjing Road Citizens' Association issued an unofficial statement yesterday, intended for discussion among users throughout the city and for study by public organizations. The person said, "The Shanghai business environment is currently in a state of severe decline, and the social economy is also quite strained. This is not the time for a telephone price increase. Moreover, there are various reasons why the price should not be increased, as repeatedly pointed out in letters from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Municipal Federation of General Chambers of Commerce, and this association to the Municipal Council and the expert committee, urging them to pay attention. (The reasons stated in the letters have been published in various newspapers, so we will set them aside for now.) Even if the calculation method proposed by the expert committee on a per-call basis could be somewhat accepted by users, the price standard and basic tier are still worthy of study. I will elaborate on three points: (1) Charging three cents for each call exceeding the basic tier is too high. Although commercial telephones vary in size and complexity, on average, each household makes at least twenty calls per day, requiring six hundred calls per month. In addition to the ten yuan for the basic 150 calls, adding 450 calls at three cents each amounts to 13.5 yuan, totaling 23.5 yuan. Compared to the previous price of 12.5 yuan per month, this is an increase of 88%. Even at one cent per call, the increase would be 16%. (2) The basic tier of 150 calls per month at ten yuan costs more than double the extra calls, charging over six cents per call. This standard is not very appropriate. Assuming that the extra calls are charged at three cents each, the basic tier should allow for thirty calls per day. (3) Assuming the basic tier is 300 calls at ten yuan, and each extra call is charged at one cent, the 600 calls per month mentioned earlier would incur an additional three yuan, totaling thirteen yuan. Compared to the previous price, this is an increase of 4%. With this method, users might be able to accept it, and the company would still increase its annual revenue by hundreds of thousands. Why be so insatiable? Moreover, someone who recently returned from London mentioned that the London Telephone Company is currently reducing its quarterly telephone fees from £1 12s 6d to £1 6s due to poor business conditions. Regional telephone fees have also been reduced from £1 7s 6d to £1. The prices for group services and business operations have also been reduced accordingly, averaging a 30% discount. With the high cost of living in London, telephone fees are being reduced. With the low cost of living in Shanghai, telephone fees are being increased. This reasoning is difficult to understand."</p>

<p>In order to increase disaster relief donations, the Flood Relief Association co-organized a chrysanthemum amusement and charity fair with the Sincere Company, with ticket revenue fully allocated to disaster relief. Since its preparation, it has received strong support from all parties. It opened at 10:00 AM and attracted over a thousand guests and spectators from all walks of life, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Members of the presidium Xu Shiying, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Liankui, Li Dachao, Li Ruotao, Huang Bodu, Fan Hengde, etc., and guests from all walks of life entered the venue one after another and took their seats in order. Many staff members from the Flood Relief Association were dispatched to the venue to provide hospitality and conduct the formalities. Mr. Xu Shiying cut the ribbon, and thunderous applause erupted. Li Ruotao was publicly elected to report on the preparation process, stating, "Today is the opening day of the chrysanthemum competition and amusement fair organized by our company. We are honored to have Mr. Xu Jing and all the chairpersons preside over the opening ceremony, and we are grateful for the enthusiastic participation of all sectors of society. We are also honored to have the presence of representatives from the flood relief associations of various provinces to provide guidance and supervision. The garden owners have all contributed excellent varieties for the competition, which is especially touching. The chrysanthemum competition and relief fair held by our company this time is in response to the severe floods in various provinces this year. The three major river basins of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River have all been affected, with tens of millions of victims and incalculable property losses. It is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. The colleagues of our company are deeply saddened by this great tragedy. Disaster relief cannot be delayed. However, our limited resources are insufficient to address the situation. Therefore, we have consulted with the members of the Flood Relief Association and stipulated that the ticket revenue from the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th of this month, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, will be allocated to the Flood Relief Association for distribution. Various chrysanthemums, goldfish, potted landscapes, etc., are all estimated at half price to help with the relief, hoping to combine the power of the people to save the victims. We sincerely hope that you will all provide strong support, buy more tickets to save more lives, and buy more pots to save more lives. This is the meaning of our association's establishment, and we hope that all sectors of society will understand." Subsequently, Xu Shiying, vice president of the Flood Relief Charity Association, delivered a speech, saying, "Distinguished chairpersons, guests from all walks of life, fellow citizens, today, Mr. Li Ruotao, general manager of the Sincere Company, and all the staff of the rooftop garden are taking advantage of the early blooming of chrysanthemums to appeal for disaster relief on behalf of the victims and are holding the first day of this public chrysanthemum competition and disaster relief fair. I, Shiying, am here to participate, representing the Disaster Relief Committee of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Shanghai fundraising for the flood relief charity associations of various provinces, and tens of millions of disaster victims, to express my heartfelt gratitude and admiration. In recent years, natural disasters have occurred frequently. Since the beginning of this summer, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River have successively experienced major floods, affecting 239 counties and cities, with a disaster area of approximately 142,000 square kilometers and over 20 million people affected. Public and private losses are estimated to be over 800 million yuan. In addition, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia also experienced floods and droughts. Compared to the major floods that occurred only in the Yangtze River basin twenty years ago, the situation is actually much more serious. When floods occurred in the Yangtze River basin, I personally went to the Yangtze River basin areas of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces to investigate the disaster situation. When floods occurred in the Yellow River basin, I also personally went to the Yellow River basin areas of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces to investigate the disaster situation. Finally, I inspected and investigated the disaster areas in northern Jiangsu and compiled a report on the flood investigation and a brief report on the flood situation and relief efforts in various provinces in 1935. I, Shiying, am following the intentions of the central government and making every effort to raise relief funds. The social sector is also able to cooperate and work together for relief. Therefore, I hope that we can raise large amounts of money in the shortest possible time and allocate them separately for relief. Moreover, the prosperity of Shanghai depends entirely on the supply from the inland provinces. If disasters occur in the inland provinces, Shanghai cannot prosper alone. Therefore, saving the victims is saving ourselves, and flood prevention is preventing for ourselves. Fortunately, all sectors of this city are very clear about this meaning. In recent months, various methods have been devised, and relief efforts have been enthusiastic. Like the national products world's fundraising for flood relief amusement fair, the Golden Grand Theatre's performance for relief, and the commission-based relief of major stores, they have followed one after another, countless examples, extremely enthusiastic. The Yong'an, Sincere, and New companies in this city have always made great efforts in disaster relief. Today, the Sincere Company is holding this disaster relief chrysanthemum fair, expanding publicity. This is commendable. For this conference, our flood relief association has specially appointed Deputy Director Li Dachao and the Sincere Company to jointly be responsible for the handling, and we hope that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically participate for the sake of disaster relief and chrysanthemum appreciation, expand the power of appeal, and make the victims get real great relief, that is the sincere prayer of this association and Shiying for tens of millions of victims." After Xu's speech, guests such as Mr. Huang Guanhai also gave speeches. The length of the speeches is omitted. Around 11:00 AM, the ceremony was completed, and various amusement activities began. A variety of performances were presented, which were extremely brilliant. According to the person in charge of the association, the situation of the floods in various provinces this time is so tragic that it cannot be described if one has not personally experienced it. Fortunately, Chinese people have donated one after another to help save the victims. Overseas Chinese have remitted funds for relief before and after, and there are many of them. This enthusiasm is really rare. It is hoped that ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life will generously contribute to benefit the victims. This is the fortune of the society and the country. Also, the association will hold three consecutive days from the 2nd to the 4th of this month, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day. All those who hold this ticket can also pass without hindrance in the afternoon. It is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention. The conference also has special chrysanthemum appreciation articles attached to the tickets. Viewers feel more convenient. Relief of disasters and recreation are both achieved. Ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life, why not come?</p>
<h3 id="e80">Xie Zhenyuan Invents Economical and Mobile "Sitings", Available in Electric and Coal Gas Versions <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Industrial Cooperative said that Xie Zhenyuan, director of the Ximolu branch of the China National Products Company, recognizing that although there are many types of modern heating appliances, most of them are quite expensive and complicated to operate, has invented two types of "economical and mobile Sitings" based on years of research, in order to save costs and suit hygiene purposes. One uses electricity, with an internal water storage device that stores an appropriate amount of clean water. The water is vaporized by electric heat, becoming a Siting. The other uses coal gas, with an internal device similar to the electric version, except that coal gas is used to burn the water tank, heating the water stored in the tank to vaporize it into a Siting. The height is 20 to 32 inches, and the width is calculated according to the number of tubes, with a minimum of 20 inches and a maximum of 30 inches. The thickness is 5 inches, and the base is equipped with four small wheels for free movement. The material is the latest type of four-tube Siting vapor band, with a delicate and beautiful design. Both the electricity and coal gas consumption are very economical, and the use is convenient. The price is low, truly meeting the principle of economy. It is understood that Xie has raised funds to establish the Shichun Factory to manufacture as much as possible to meet social needs.</p>
<h3 id="e81">How Quickly Did Yin Fuyao Die? <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Although There Was Scuffling, No Wounds Were Found Upon Examination.</p>
<p>Yin Fuyao, 17 years old, the son of Yin Kexing, a resident of No. 7 Haichang Branch Road, Zhabei, from Yancheng, usually made a living carrying a glutinous rice ball stall and selling them on the street. On the 20th of last month, a passerby ate 50 wen worth of glutinous rice balls and presented a two-jiao coin, asking Yin to find him 460 wen. Yin observed that the two-jiao coin was made of lead and asked Wang to exchange it. Wang instead accused Yin of switching the coin, leading to a conflict and scuffle. The police took them to the local police station and fined them to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, after Yin Fuyao returned home, he became bedridden. Until the night before last, he suddenly died. Yin Kexing, the father of the deceased, along with Xu Fengxiang, the bailiff of the 11th tu, reported to the District Court for an autopsy yesterday morning. Li Fen, a prosecutor, and Shen, a coroner, were dispatched to the scene. The examination revealed that Yin Fuyao had no wounds. Yin Kexing insisted that he died from being beaten and requested justice. The judge ordered that the body be sent to the Zhenru No. 1 Medical Research Institute for an autopsy to clarify the truth and convince all parties.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Shanghai Public Security Bureau: Establishing Additional Drug Rehabilitation Hospital, Site Already Determined <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Dagongshe reports that since the Shanghai Public Security Bureau began compulsory registration of smokers, the daily workload has doubled and intensified. The total number of registered smokers has now been tallied, reaching over 22,000. The establishment of an additional drug rehabilitation hospital has been agreed upon. Dagongshe reporters have investigated and reported the details below:</p>
<p>Statistics on the Total Number of Registered Smokers</p>
<p>The voluntary registration of smokers in this city began on July 1st and ended at the end of October. The total number of registered smokers, as announced by the Smoker Registration Section of the Public Security Bureau, is 19,934 over the past four months. Among them, 8,435 received general permits, 11,497 received permits for the poor, and 2 received travel permits. In addition, a total of 2,274 people applied for rehabilitation (the number from the Laobeimen branch has not yet been sent, and the branch has more than 2,000 people). 1,392 people have been sent for rehabilitation, 940 have been discharged after rehabilitation, 452 are currently undergoing rehabilitation, and 882 have not yet been sent for rehabilitation. The total number reaches 22,208. Together with the smokers from Laobeimen who have not been sent for rehabilitation, the total is approximately 25,000 people.</p>
<p>Agreed-Upon Measures for Establishing Additional Hospital</p>
<p>The bureau previously anticipated that the number of arrested smokers would be high after the start of compulsory registration. The existing hospitals in South Shanghai and North Shanghai were insufficient to meet the demand. In addition to temporarily borrowing a portion of the prisons of the Caohejing Jiangsu Second District Court to accommodate smoking offenders, it was planned to build a new hospital capable of accommodating 500 people. The municipal government ordered the Public Security Bureau and the Health Bureau to handle the matter jointly. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Dai, the section chief of the Narcotics Control Section of the Public Security Bureau, and Wu, the section chief of the First Section of the Health Bureau, met in the conference room of the Health Bureau to discuss the implementation. As a result, it was decided that building a new hospital would take too much time and would not be a permanent solution. There were already many smokers waiting for rehabilitation, and further delays would only increase congestion. In order to shorten the rehabilitation time, it was decided not to build a new hospital but to find and rent an empty building near the city center, large enough to accommodate 1,000 people. It has now been entrusted to Section Chief Wu to handle the matter. Once a suitable location is rented, an application will be submitted to the municipal government for approval, and the smokers applying for rehabilitation will be sent there.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Public Security Bureau's Chief of the Smoker Registration Section Dai Lizhen and the head of the Health Bureau Li Tingan decided yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to use the housing in the Jiangwan "Gaojing Memorial New Village" as the site for the temporary drug rehabilitation hospital. It is expected that the hospital can accommodate 1,000 smoking offenders. Public Security Bureau Chief Dai Lizhen also personally went to inspect the site and decided that the Health Bureau should prepare a document to submit to the municipal government for approval, and then repair the houses in the village to officially transform it into a temporary drug rehabilitation hospital and begin to accommodate smoking offenders.</p>

<p>After the Supreme Court confirmed that the sugar industry had a 50% ownership, while the construction and flower industries, along with the foreign goods industry (i.e., the dried seafood industry), each held 25% ownership, misunderstandings were resolved and harmony was restored. It is now reported that the Dried Seafood Guild, due to its increasingly busy affairs, found its rented premises on Zhoushan Road in the French Concession insufficient. Consequently, the guild moved back to Dianchun Hall a few days ago to resume its operations.</p>

<p>Children's Bookstore Prepares to Expand, Re-elect Directors and Supervisors... Increase Capital</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the business of Children's Bookstore Co., Ltd. has been growing year by year.

Yesterday at 4 PM, the company held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and Pan Gongzhan was elected as chairman of the board. In accordance with the resolution of the shareholders' meeting, it was decided to first increase the new capital by 80,000 yuan as a preliminary plan for development, and the subscription will begin immediately, closing at the end of February of the 25th year.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association on Renji Road recently received a report from the Peixian branch regarding disaster relief efforts. The report stated that the disaster situation in the county was extremely severe, as previously reported. In the Binhu area, disaster victims were everywhere. A previous request for 5,200 yuan for disaster relief was granted, but it was like a drop in the bucket. Since the beginning of autumn, the Yellow River has been surging dramatically. Another request for 5,000 yuan was granted to Peixian, but before it could be investigated and distributed, the Xiaosiduan levee broke, and the disaster area suddenly increased. The sixth and seventh districts were completely submerged, and most of the first and second districts were also flooded. At that time, they were busy building protective embankments and providing emergency relief. Before one wave subsided, another arose. On the night of the 24th of this month, a strong wind and heavy rain struck, and the Gaoxiaohu levee suddenly collapsed again. The water flowed rapidly, and the Yellow River surrounded the city in all directions within an hour. Currently, the disaster area has expanded further. The sixth and seventh districts have become a vast swamp, and most of the first and second districts are submerged. Part of the fifth district is also submerged. The water is rising daily, and the number of disaster victims is increasing. According to a recent survey in the sixth and seventh districts, the number of disaster victims has reached over 6,000. The previously received 5,000 yuan is a very small amount and difficult to distribute. Recently, the work of protecting the city has been urgent, and the first, second, and fifth districts have not yet been surveyed. In this situation, it is impossible to start distribution without requesting a large sum of money. It is requested that a large sum of money be approved for early investigation and distribution to save the disaster victims, and that a number of cotton-padded clothes be allocated to help the disaster victims keep warm.</p>
<p>Publication of Feng Menglong's Mountain Songs, Published by Chuanjing Tang in Penglai Market</p>

It includes prefaces and postscripts by Gu Jiegang, Qian Nanyang, and others. It sells for eight jiao and is quite popular for a time.</p>

<p>Woolen Fabric Industry Announces Price Increase</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Statistics on the General Situation of Primary Education in the Country</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Education's statistics on various types of education, in general, higher education, secondary education, primary education, and social education have all been counted up to the 23rd year. However, the overall detailed classification statistics of each county and city directly under the jurisdiction of various departments and bureaus, because each department first investigates and collects each province and city (cities are easier, provinces have six or seventy counties, or even more than a hundred counties, so the circulation is repeated and time-consuming, and it is difficult to complete in a short period of time), circulation, It is difficult to report in detail for a while, and it is even more difficult to collect the remote provinces for a while. Therefore, the Ministry of Education's statistics on primary education in primary and secondary schools, in addition to the general statistics for each year after the 20th year that have been prepared, detailed classification statistics are either being printed or being sorted out, and the essentials of the national primary education statistics for the 20th year that have been released by the Ministry are briefly described below.</p>
<p>(1) The number of primary education schools in the country in the 20th year was 259,863. In terms of type, there were 829 kindergartens, 238,393 primary schools, 19,835 senior primary schools, and 806 other schools. In terms of establishment, there were 5 national schools, 1,329 provincial and municipal schools, 60,439 county and municipal schools, 137,219 district schools, and 60,871 private schools.</p>
<p>(2) There were a total of 612,185 classes, including 1,318 kindergarten classes, 554,809 primary school classes, 54,892 senior primary school classes, and 1,166 other classes.</p>
<p>(3) The total number of children was 11,720,596, including 36,770 kindergarten students, 10,162,297 primary school students, 1,496,278 senior primary school students, and 25,251 other school students. By gender, there were 9,961,198 boys, accounting for 84.9%, and 1,759,398 girls, accounting for 15.1%.</p>

<p>Although the farmers are very busy, they are very happy. They play the violin and sing joyful songs. When it's time to rest, the young men and women dance, very joyfully. This kind of scene cannot be seen everywhere now, but in places like Transylvania, it is still seen.</p>
<p>There are also many interesting customs here during the wheat harvest. For example, during the harvest period, if the landlord comes to the fields, the most beautiful maiden among the harvesters must immediately stop working and tie him up with a rope made of wheat leaves. Then the maiden asks the landlord for a certain amount of ransom money. She will never untie the rope until she receives a considerable price. This kind of ransom money used to be dozens of Pengő, but now it is a few kilograms of fine wine. It is said that this is done so that the wheat will not fall off the ears. At the same time, during the harvest, the first and last ears of wheat have significant religious meaning. The first ear of wheat to be cut is cut by a child symbolizing fertility. After cutting, it is erected into a cross and offered to the angels, thus worshipping it as a destroyer of demons. As for the last ear of wheat, it is left for the rats, wild birds, and demons. In addition, the poor can also get a little favor here. In some places, the farmers make the leftover ears of wheat into a human figure, decorate it with flowers, and dance around it.</p>
<p>In some parts of Hungary, during the wheat harvest season, we also saw such a strange thing: the farmers made wreaths out of cut wheat sheaves and transported them to the landlord's house. During this time, the harvesters walked, singing and dancing, and the women all wore white clothes or other gorgeous costumes, carrying bouquets of flowers together. In Transylvania, the farmers piled the cut wheat sheaves on carts, and then used wheat ears and wild flowers to make a beautiful big arch on the cart. They also found the most beautiful virgin who was not afraid of cold water to stand in the middle of it. Then they formed a line and drove to the landlord's house. When they passed in front of each farmhouse, people poured cold water on the beautiful woman on the cart. This brings a rich harvest. When the procession arrived at the landlord's house, the landlord gave the farmers some gifts, and the farmers offered him this kind of poem:</p>
<p>"The harvest is over,</p>
<p>The affectionate master now welcomes us,</p>
<p>We hurry to participate.</p>
<p>We must offer fragrant wreaths!</p>
<p>We use beautiful garden flowers and wildflowers,</p>
<p>To tie a lovely wreath of wheat ears;</p>
<p>For the master, we bring it here,</p>
<p>To participate in the master's harvest thanksgiving!</p>
<p>God, please give us lasting years,</p>
<p>Please give our couple a lasting life!</p>
<p>Our couple is as harmonious as a pair of doves!"</p>
<p>After this ceremonial exchange, a grand feast and dance began. They drank under the clear sky until dawn.</p>
<p>When the grape harvest season comes, the Hungarians are of course very busy, but at this time they show infinite joy. They forget all their pain and sorrow, and they want to drink recklessly. There is a popular saying here: "A grape harvest without wine and entertainment is like a wedding without music." From this, one can imagine the joy of the Hungarians during the grape harvest season.</p>
<p>The Hungarian vineyards have volcanic soil, which is more suitable for cultivating grapes than anywhere else in the world. The grapes produced here can be made into the famous golden grape wine, which is said to bring the dead back to life after drinking it. In addition, there are several other types of wine that are also very precious. Therefore, Hungarians cherish their produce very much. This treasure is their panacea for dispelling worries.</p>
<p>Hungarian weddings are mostly held at the end of the grape harvest. They celebrate the wedding with gifts that cannot be separated from new wheat bread and new wine. Here is a little song:</p>
<p>"The virgin who first sees the red grapes,</p>
<p>Will surely marry in the autumn."</p>
<p>This is a demonstration of the relationship between Hungarian weddings and grapes, and it is also a manifestation of their cherishing of grapes.</p>
<p>When the harvest of large vineyards is over, just like during the wheat harvest, Hungarians also sing, dance, and revel. The girls also wear white clothes, decorated with beautiful wild flower crowns, to participate in this joyful performance.</p>
<p>Occasional Chats on the Hegemonic War Between Britain and the United States by Ju Xiao</p>
<p>Which is ultimately the leading and strongest country in the world? This is the reason for the contradictions between the imperialists in the world, and it is also the eternal problem between Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Since the United States is swaying on the world political stage under the guise of peace, it is naturally impossible to openly propose the slogan of re-dividing the world. But it cleverly used the "open door policy pill, coated with a layer of sweet sugar, to compete with Britain, France, and other countries for economic power. The so-called open door policy means that the United States can use capital to join the aggression with equal rights in all exclusively occupied colonial areas. After this brilliant plan is realized, the power to rule the colonies will become a hollow formality, while the claws of American capital, relying on their strong strength, will actually occupy the position of economic power.</p>
<p>Canada is the best example. Although it formally belongs to Britain, it is economically no different from the United States.</p>
<p>As for the king of the sea, it should naturally belong to Britain, but how can the United States not devote all its efforts to the naval competition issue? Under the cover of peaceful lies, the United States once said to Britain: "Regardless of whether you agree that your warship tonnage does not exceed mine, if we ever start an arms race, you are afraid that you will not be able to outrun me no matter what." At that time, Britain was thinking of getting help from the United States to stabilize its finances, and everyone could not risk openly competing to build warships, wasting countless amounts of money in vain, so the principle of Two Powers Standard was established.</p>
<p>But although Britain swallowed its anger, it was determined not to remain silent. It would never easily let go of its hegemonic position. It tried its best to engage in the new development of military supplies, making the value of large battleships more than doubled than before. Also, since there was no limit on small warships, it maintained its maritime hegemony at all costs as much as possible. The failure of the Geneva Naval Disarmament Conference was as natural as water flowing into a channel. It could not be forced.</p>
<p>Their competition in military affairs is full of intrigue at all times. Let's observe the situation as follows: Apart from the Hawaiian Islands, the United States has very few naval bases, so it needs large cruisers to threaten combat warships (armored and gunned merchant ships in wartime). As for Britain, because it has many connecting naval bases, it does not need overly large cruisers, but needs light and flexible warships to protect commerce and control commercial navigation. It can select good ships from its original powerful transport fleet at any time, arm them, and make them large cruisers. This kind of preparation has already been prepared in peacetime. Furthermore, the training of sailors is much better in Britain than in the United States. Therefore, even if the United States builds warships on a large scale immediately, it will not be able to catch up in time.</p>
<p>Later, the military agreement between Britain and France gave the United States a serious demonstration significance. The organized understanding and cooperation between Britain and France greatly disappointed the United States in its enthusiasm for ordering large warships. Although some people believe that the Anglo-French agreement was Britain's surrender to French militarism, sacrificing the Locarno peace policy, Louis George believes that it was the most glorious event in British diplomatic history after the war.</p>
<p>At present, the contradiction between Britain and the United States is becoming more and more serious every day. This can be proved by the fact that the US warship construction program has been approved by the Senate. Needless to say, the center of future competition is still the hegemonic issue of capitalist countries.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Nocturne by Zhong</p>
<p>Christmas, Christmas in the South. With a heavy heart full of homesickness, I followed my classmate Lao Cheng, lazily trampling on the winter sunset, until we finally reached the front of a small gray Western-style house. Pushing open the small door of the fence, I could hear the clear sound of a piano inside. The living room was decorated very neatly, with a slightly gentle French flavor. In front of the glass window, a girl of seventeen or eighteen was playing the piano, wearing a green cheongsam, her hair blacker than charcoal. This was Lao Cheng's sister, Mingzhu.</p>
<p>Hearing the rough footsteps of a man, she turned her head as agile as a cat. Her pale olive-shaped face, worried eyes, and slender hands were still playing Chopin's "Nocturne." The somber and desolate piano sound flew out of the open small window, slipping into the dim Christmas evening sky. Lao Cheng told me that she had recently lost her love.</p>
<p>I looked at her worried, tired, but peaceful eyes—the depths of her eyes were a mystery that young people could not understand. That's how we met. In her eyes, I might just be a very ordinary young man, but in my eyes, she had such an amazing charm!</p>
<p>The next day, I ran all over the bookstores in the city to find a beautiful and meaningful New Year's card to send to her. After searching for a long time, I finally found one that was relatively satisfactory. Then I personally ran to the post office to mail it. When I came back, I felt a lot lighter. It felt like there was no lead block pressing heavily on my heart. However, the feeling of being relaxed did not last long, because I was worried about her reply again. Several times, I hid from my friends and circled around her house alone, feeling both scared and anxious in my heart, and my pace always became unnaturally fast. Sometimes there was piano music, and I really hoped that she would stick her head out from behind the fluttering white curtains. Sometimes there wasn't even piano music, and I worried that she was sick or something...</p>
<p>On the last day of that year, a misty winter morning, I finally received a light blue letter from the old postman. The envelope had delicate female handwriting on it. I felt like my heart was about to jump into my throat. Hiding from my classmates, I ran alone to a small path covered with fallen leaves. After running blindly for a while, I finally picked a very quiet place to sit down.</p>
<p>Her New Year's card was a landscape painting, with a bit of the scent of cosmetics. I stared at those slanted, feminine, small characters in blue ink. I felt like I was the happiest person in the world. The card showed the scenery of a winter sunset in Northern Europe. Snow was piled up on the streets, bridges, roofs, and branches. The Stone Bridge Emperor was an old small church. The windows of the church revealed brilliant lights, and behind the church was a crimson sunset. The tone of this painting was unusually somber. It could easily make people feel the weariness of life. A seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl, a medicine-like girl, really shouldn't use such a somber landscape painting to send to her boyfriend! However, at that time, I still felt unusually happy.</p>
<p>After that, I went to her house twice more. Everyone became a little more familiar, and talking became more natural. During that winter vacation, I returned to my hometown. After several nights of insomnia, I finally mustered up the courage to write the first letter to her. A week later, she replied with a short letter. Although it was such a short letter, it stirred up my infinite emotions. So I wrote the second letter, the third letter...</p>
<p>In the spring, school started, and I rushed back to S City like an arrow. As soon as I arrived in S City, I entrusted my luggage to my classmates to take care of, and again hired a car to go to her house alone. At this time, it was early spring in southern Fujian. Everything was filled with a gentle spring mood. The verdant branches of the street trees, the laughter of children, the shadows of the spring sun, and the new store windows all made me feel as if I was in a beautiful dream on a summer night.</p>
<p>Getting out of the car, I gently knocked on the door of her house with trembling hands. It was her seven or eight-year-old younger brother who came to open the door, his black and shiny eyes wide open, playfully shaking his head. I didn't understand what he meant. An odd incense was burning in the living room, and a light blue smoke circled out of the clean glass window. A woman's head stretched out from the study, it was her mother, followed by a chili-like wry smile. She said Lao Cheng was not at home, and her voice was a bit choked up. Then I suddenly felt that the living room was much emptier than before. In front of the glass window was still that black piano, with a layer of dust covering the lid.</p>
<p>She had passed away two days ago from acute pneumonia. She, a withered flower, did not have unlimited attachment to life, and death was just a quiet rest. But for me, how could I forget her cat-like head, pale face, dark black hair, tired and worried eyes! So, every time I heard Chopin's "Nocturne," my eyes were always filled with tears like a child's.</p>
<p>A Discussion on Training and Cultivation: Saying "Turning Back" by Chao Fan</p>
<p>To press on with a stiff neck and advance bravely is a hero; to shrink back and hesitate is a coward. This is a common proverb used to encourage others to be capable and persevering in doing things, not to hesitate or give up halfway, and not to turn back midway. Indeed, if a person lacks a brave and resolute spirit in doing things, and turns back halfway, unwilling to go to the end, then his life's work will always be abandoned halfway and he will achieve nothing. Because of this, the two words "turn back" are the worst in this case. They represent a kind of indecisive bravery, a lack of forcefulness, and an action that is not adopted by any tough guy with responsibility and courage.</p>
<p>However, we often hear people say "Turning back is the shore" [i.e., repenting brings salvation]. This sentence originates from religion. It teaches people to abandon evil and return to righteousness, to abandon evil and follow good. Therefore, in one turn back, you can become a Buddha from a sinner, and jump from hell to heaven. So this sentence is originally superstitious in its original meaning, because becoming a Buddha is fundamentally a fantasy. There is no such thing as a Buddha in the human world or in heaven. Even if you turn back a thousand or ten thousand times, you will not become a Buddha. Even though this is said, it has become a habit of persuading people to reform and start anew in general secular language. This means that people cannot be without fault. "To correct mistakes is the greatest good." If a person is doing wrong and bad things, and also has to press on with a stiff neck and act recklessly, then this cannot be regarded as a hero, but only as continuing to degenerate and being beyond redemption, which is harmful to yourself, your country, and society. Moreover, in this case, the more courageous you are to turn back, the better, because only the wise can make the darkness turn to light between breaths; only heroes can have the courage not to cover up their shortcomings or hide their faults. In this case, turning back is not only a proper and good behavior, but also something that only a tough guy can do, because resolutely reforming and starting anew also requires the greatest courage and boldness.</p>
<p>The above two points are the ways that ordinary people use the word "turn back" to predict future actions. When examining past actions, people also commonly use the word "turn back," and it also has both positive and negative meanings. When many people reflect on the past, they often sigh, "Past events are unbearable to recall." The word "recall" is an elegant way of using the word "turn back," which goes without saying. People often sigh that "it is unbearable to recall," which is a term to express a feeling of sentimentalizing the past. Either they feel that the present is not as good as the past, or they feel that the past is not as good as the present. When a person was previously in a smooth and lucky situation, but now has returned to desolation and decline, they sigh "it is unbearable to recall" when feeling that good dreams do not last forever. Conversely, when a person has done many bad things in the past, wasted their years and wasted their energy and money, and has spent their precious life in vain, when they finally wake up, they also sigh that "it is unbearable to recall." Therefore, when people turn back to look at their history, they either admire or hate it. This will naturally lead them to evaluate and review their past.</p>
<p>Page 21</p>
<p>The review of past life is a guide for a new life in the future. This is true for personal review, and it should also be true for social movements. The future success of many great social reformers or transformers is based on a strict review of past gains and losses. Without old lessons to enrich our experience and guide our future activities, we will not be able to recognize the objective overall development trend. Therefore, those great social reformers or transformers not only often turn back to review history themselves, but also often teach people to turn back to history, to review the development of history, in order to determine future activities. In this way, whether it is for the individual, the country, or society, turning back to history in order to gain experience and lessons, and turning back to carefully examine the gains and losses of the past, has absolute significance for the progress of mankind and the development of a new life. And no matter what the result of your turning back is, whether you give a good or bad evaluation of the past, it is necessary as long as you are gaining lessons.</p>
<p>However, there are also people in society who, when they turn back to look at old history, do not focus on gaining historical lessons, but are instead intoxicated by old traces, or stop moving forward, or even follow history back, which has the opposite result from the above-mentioned turning back to past history, and becomes a turn back that hinders the evolution of mankind. Turning back is anti-evolution. This kind of turning back is not needed by mankind.</p>
<p>We humans live in living events. In the complex events and endlessly changing environments, engaging in life's struggles cannot mechanically adopt a fixed way of acting. We cannot say that we should never turn back in any situation. If the cause we are working hard for clearly has a smooth road to success ahead, and victory is already in sight, but at this time, we are blocked by some obstacles that can be overcome, and we retreat in fear of difficulty, adopting a method of turning back, then that possible success will be transformed by you into failure. In this case, turning back is not a blessing but a disaster. Conversely, if there is clearly a dead end ahead of us, and no matter how hard we try to rush forward, there will only be a destined result of failure, then if we do not know how to turn back, and still bury our heads and squeeze forward regardless, the result will naturally only be like a rat disturbing a cow's horn, the more you disturb, the tighter it becomes, and there is no way out, and you will end up hitting the wall and suffering a bloody sacrifice in vain. This is just like fighting between two armies. If the enemy's formation has already shown signs of collapse, but you do not have the courage to advance, but are turning back and looking around, or even thinking about turning back and running away, then not only will you have no victory to gain, but you will be defeated under the enemy's counterattack. Also, if strategically speaking, you should retreat, then you should turn back and retreat very quickly at this time. If not, and you still press on with a stiff neck, or hesitate and refuse to turn back and retreat, the result will either be the annihilation of the entire army, or you will be surrounded by the enemy. Mankind is the same on the battle line of life.</p>
<p>In short, not all turning back is good or bad, nor is all not turning back good or bad. In terms of avoiding failure, correcting mistakes, and obtaining past lessons, turning back of all kinds is appropriate and correct. But in terms of striving for possible victory and not making oneself a laggard in the times, not turning back of all kinds is correct and appropriate. Therefore, we can only decide whether to turn back or not based on the nature of the complex situation and the changes in the circumstances.</p>
<p>International Intelligence: American Industry and Commerce by Se Ying</p>
<p>The United States of America, which has the nickname "Kingdom of Gold," could not help but tremble uneasily on its throne at a time when the world was suffering from an economic recession. As a result, President Hoover lost the opportunity to be re-elected and left the White House sadly. Although President Roosevelt was good at maneuvering, each "brain trust" that he pulled out of his sleeve became like dew under the morning sun, and less than one in ten achieved practical results.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that American industry and commerce once emitted a glorious splendor that would last for thousands of years. But their economists could not deeply observe the progress of the American economy and predict the future trend of this industry and commerce. The endless production finally ended in a complete defeat. We only need to look at the party of monopoly capital—the Republican Party—which, in the previous election, had no political program, but only the slogan "Good for everyone" to connect small bourgeois, farmers, and the electorate of the working class, to believe this.</p>
<p>The economic state of the United States has almost certain panic centers. The most important are the automobile industry, the coal industry, the oil industry, the construction industry, various installment payment businesses, and securities speculation. In the automobile industry, there will inevitably come a day of overproduction. The Ford Company alone can produce 2.5 million cars per year, but its competitors are also maximizing their production capacity and producing cheap cars as much as possible. General Motors Company "caught up" in front, and other medium-sized car companies "followed closely" behind. As a result, the total capacity of American car factories is at least six million vehicles per year. As a result of such fierce competition, small and medium-sized car factories will inevitably be defeated. The tragedies and tragedies of business wars seem to be staged in the same way.</p>
<p>There is also an oversupply in coal production. In 1928, although there was a major miners' strike and the output dropped slightly, there was no slight decrease in stockpiles. Afterwards, the sharp overproduction crisis became unmanageable.</p>
<p>The oil industry has the same fate. The daily production of oil is still 2.4 million barrels. The inventory in the stacks is accumulating day by day, and it is now sufficient for the whole country for one year. Prices tend to fall, and a crisis is almost inevitable.</p>
<p>Because of the weakness of the purchasing power of the entire world market, overproduction, and a large number of unemployed workers are as prevalent as the flu, which makes installment payment operators lose their business reliance. Because unemployed workers and employees have no way to purchase these household, vehicle, clothing, and other supplies, the financial position of financial enterprises that invested in this type of business is put at risk.</p>
<p>Speculation in the stock exchange is also very prevalent. Four or five million shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange in one day, and the price fluctuations are extremely large. This kind of securities trading... trend.</p>
<p>In addition to these crisis elements, the American agricultural panic is also in a constant state, and it will go to the next level. As for the working class, Bowers has a million completely unemployed workers and three million part-time workers. According to accurate statistics, there are between 5.6 million and 8 million unemployed people. At present, agriculture and mining are both deliberately reducing workers. Commerce, the automobile industry, and the construction industry are also eliminating unskilled workers in order to rationalize.</p>
<p>Industry and commerce are in such a state... When will the business recovery come under the blue sky? Roosevelt spent a lot of effort, which is no different from a drunkard raising his hands to draw a big circle in the sky.</p>

<p>Literary Works: Extract from the Account Book (1) by Pu Yu</p>
<p>On the way.</p>
<p>Arriving at a thatched shop, the coachmen shouted, "Have a snack." As for me, I used official jargon to order them to pull the cart quickly. It turned out that these two bastards parked the cart and shouted in a low voice:</p>
<p>"We're hungry! Our bellies are made of flesh!"</p>
<p>Damn it! What's the big deal if you starve to death? It's no small matter to delay my official business!—But it's true that they can't run without filling their stomachs.</p>
<p>The food at the chicken shop is only fit for the lower classes—the stomachs of the coachmen. I almost vomited at the sight of it. What's hateful is that the ugly woman even asked:</p>
<p>"Does this master want to eat?"</p>
<p>Damn it, I really wanted to slap her. Fortunately, Jiang Xiwu helped me scold:</p>
<p>"You don't know how to speak properly. Do you think this food is fit for...?"</p>
<p>Before he could finish scolding, I took out a "Pao Tai" cigarette to calm my nerves. Just as I put it in my mouth, Lao Jiang quickly fumbled for a match. With a "scratch" sound, he lit it for me. This kid was so eager to please me that I felt embarrassed. I had no choice but to give him one. He stretched out both hands as if holding a holy decree, his face full of smiles:</p>
<p>"Thank you, Director!"</p>
<p>I exhaled a puff of smoke before replying with a "Hmm." Because the dignity of a superior cannot be taken lightly, I can only hide my love for him in my heart.</p>
<p>"Director, about the Yuan Tai Flour Mill matter, what exactly...?"</p>
<p>He hesitated to say the second half of the sentence, but I understood that he wanted to probe the truth. Is that possible? I was selected from among the best. So I put on a serious face and glared at him coldly:</p>
<p>"The Provincial Bureau has an order, and the Director also sent a telegram. Don't think wildly!" (To be continued)</p>
<p>Literary Works: Pharmacy by Mao Yannian</p>
<p>It is already the season for heatstroke, the season when "heatstroke" and "malaria" are prevalent. It is said that "when the weather is hot, the doctors never stop." In theory, it should be a time when doctors and pharmacies are "prospering." If it were in previous years—</p>
<p>"If it were in previous years," said Doctor Xia, "at that time, I would have been so busy that I couldn't breathe. Our pharmacy business would also be..."</p>
<p>"Who says no? I still remember it clearly: one day you saw twenty-five patients at the counter and went to the countryside to see four. You also sold fifty-two doses of medicine. Just the cash alone was a hundred strings of cash. At that time, at that time... um, um..." Doctor Xia's wife said with a bit of emotion, "At that time, not only was our business good, but other people's businesses were also..."</p>
<p>Indeed, at that time, not only was Doctor Xia's "Fuxing Hall" "prospering," but other people's businesses were also "prosperous." Even Wang the Monk, such a lousy doctor, and the lousy pharmacy he opened had many people seeing doctors and many people filling prescriptions. However, they could never catch up with Doctor Xia, because among the seven doctors and seven pharmacies in Liu Town, Doctor Xia was considered the most famous, and the "Fuxing Hall" signboard was considered the oldest. It is said that his grandfather once treated the emperor and cured his illness in the Imperial Hospital. The large plaque with the words "Merit Equal to the State Physician" that hangs in his house was bestowed by imperial decree. After the old imperial physician retired and returned to his hometown, he opened this pharmacy—"Fuxing Hall"—in Liu Town. Thus, one generation of small imperial physicians was passed down to the current Doctor Xia. Originally, Doctor Xia was also called "Imperial Physician" when he was first born, but later, after the Republic of China was established, he slowly changed his name to "Doctor." However, no matter how the name changed, Doctor Xia was still a "hereditary Confucian physician." As a result, many people came to see him, and the pharmacy business was especially good. Carriages came and went every day, very enthusiastically, very "prestigious"! However, most of the people who invited him were officials and gentlemen. As for the poor, because they were afraid that he would be arrogant and demand a lot of money, they usually didn't dare to invite him. They only mustered up their courage to invite him once or twice when they were seriously ill. Therefore, if Doctor Xia's sedan chair appeared in the villages of Liu Town, they knew that someone's illness was already very serious.</p>
<p>But in recent years, fewer and fewer people have invited Doctor Xia to see a doctor, and the medicine from "Fuxing Hall" has gradually become less "popular." As a result, Doctor Xia was confused and very anxious: "What is the reason for this? Could it be that all the patients have died!"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Doctor Xia's wife said disapprovingly, "There are many patients. I think it's because you're too arrogant. You have to take a sedan chair every time you go out. Think about it, when poor people get sick, they have to borrow a sedan chair to invite a doctor, prepare food and drink, pay for the consultation, and pay for the medicine. Where do they get so much money? I think you..."</p>
<p>Doctor Xia nodded and stroked his beard. Later, he really took the sedan chair less often, didn't eat the food of the poor, and didn't care much about the consultation fee. As a result, poor patients gradually came to invite him, and they also advertised to others: "Doctor Xia is good now, he doesn't demand too much."</p>
<p>But now that the summer season has arrived, I heard that many people returning to their hometowns are suffering from "malaria." Why are so few people inviting me to see a doctor? He paced slowly in the magic box room, holding a white copper water pipe in his left hand, and the paper twist in his right hand had an inch-long ash. His brows were furrowed tightly, as if it was difficult to figure out the reason. Finally, he suddenly said angrily: "Damn it, there are such strange things in the world: patients don't invite doctors, don't take medicine! I've been practicing medicine for thirty years, and I've never been like this before..."</p>
<p>He was about to say more when he suddenly saw the words "Sacred Medicine for Malaria" on the back cover of a book that his son was holding. Looking further down, he saw "Quinine." He couldn't help but feel angry and slammed the cigarette pipe heavily on the tea table. He cursed with force: "Damn it, what is this "sacred medicine"? I don't believe it can cure diseases!"</p>
<p>The son was startled and put down a "royal leg," sat up straight, rolled his eyes and looked at him. After a long time, he said, "What are you angry about, old man?"</p>
<p>"What? Look—" He took the book from his son's hand and pointed to the back cover, "Look, isn't this nonsense?"</p>
<p>The son then understood the reason for his anger, so he smiled and said:</p>
<p>"There's no need to get angry about this. However, many people now believe in Western medicine, and Western medicine is popular all over the country. Even our school has invited a Western doctor..."</p>
<p>"Humph!" The old man was even more angry, "You young people, after reading a few foreign books, you forget your roots. How can Western medicine be compared with Chinese medicine? Their diagnosis doesn't involve "looking, listening, asking, and feeling the pulse," and their use of drugs doesn't involve "yin and yang and the five elements." They don't distinguish between "ruler, minister, father, and son," and they can't even figure out the "heart, liver, spleen, and kidneys." How can they know what is called "pulse theory" and what is called "drug properties"? Not to mention the ancient sages and virtuous people, just take me as an example. I have treated countless dangerous and serious illnesses since I was born. If you were to encounter a Western doctor, it would be terrible! You should know that the medicine used by Western doctors is all "hegemonic," while Chinese medicine is "the king's way..."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, take those words and tell them to the patients. You always have such an old temper, always saying how good you are, but other people insist on seeing a Western doctor. Look, the second wife of Jia on Heng Street didn't go to the city to live in the hospital after her ex-husband died? A few years ago, when the rich people in our town got sick, they almost all invited you to see them, but now they always like to find a Western doctor. I say..."</p>
<p>Before Doctor Xia's wife could finish speaking, Doctor Xia interrupted her and said, "You all say Western medicine is amazing, then I won't do this craft anymore! Is it okay to let the whole family starve to death?"</p>
<p>The son said, as if feeling embarrassed: "It's not that Western medicine is amazing, but many people believe in it, which has an impact on our business. At the same time, people are getting poorer day by day, and many don't have money to treat illnesses. They just endure it if they can."</p>
<p>The old man had nothing to say, but he was still very angry in his heart. He hated why some people wanted to see a Western doctor and why they didn't see a Chinese doctor. So he wanted to publicize the "mysterious and profound" aspects of Chinese medicine and expose the "nonsense" of Western medicine. Only in this way could he regain people's hearts and his business could improve. But what method should he use? After thinking about it, he couldn't come up with a plan. Finally, he suddenly remembered that people in the town often came to paste advertisements, publicizing the advantages and effects of certain Western doctors or medicines. That's right, the reason why Western medicine is trusted is because they know how to advertise. He can do this, so why can't I? So his heart relaxed and his eyes lit up. With a decisive attitude, he ordered his son, "Go and get me a few sheets of yellow paper for wrapping medicine."</p>
<p>Doctor Xia grinded the ink, dipped the brush, and waved it on the yellow paper... "Medicine is a benevolent art. Shi... Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs and learned about the properties of medicines, so he taught the people about medicine. Passed down to later generations, the principles are clear, and the skills are also refined. For example, Zhongjing's treatment of internal diseases and Hua Tuo's treatment of external diseases have the magical effect of reviving the dead. Are they lacking in the power of miraculous elixirs and immortal medicines? Until recent times, the world's customs have gradually changed, and people have forgotten their roots. They respect Western medicine as sacred and regard Western medicine as noble products. As a result, demons and heretics are scattered throughout China, and worthless things are spread in all directions. They don't know that Western medicine is unfamiliar with pulse theory and doesn't recognize the properties of medicines. In this way, with yin and yang not distinguished, how can diseases be cured? This hall has been a hereditary Confucian physician for generations, with secret family recipes. Moreover, my late father once served as an imperial physician and personally cured the emperor's illness. Since I was born, I have read the Materia Medica thoroughly. I have hung up my gourd (practiced medicine) for thirty years, and all the dangerous illnesses I have encountered have been cured with medicine. Recently, the summer heat is steaming, and diseases arise from it. I am mindful of the meaning of "medicine is a benevolent art." Those who are poor and come to see me will not be charged for medicine. Why not come!</p>
<p>Doctor Xia wrote five sheets with great enthusiasm, then shook his head and read them again. Then he looked at his son very proudly: "How do you think this compares to the advertisements of those Western pharmacies?"</p>
<p>"It's good," the son said with a smile, "But I'm afraid many people won't understand it."</p>
<p>"Don't understand? It's so thorough."</p>
<p>His son's words seemed to disappoint him a little, but he didn't mind. He instructed his apprentice to first wipe the plaque in the central hall and the wooden couplets on both sides clean (because the central hall is the place where wealthy people have their pulses taken), and then brush those small plaques hanging around the cabinet room, such as "Zhongjing's Legacy" and "Bian Que Reborn," and wash them. Taking advantage of the fact that today is a "slow market" (the market town where we are from calls the market day "dang chang" and peacetime "leng chang</p>

<p>Da Yun Company Frequently Awards Big Prizes: A Laborer Becomes Wealthy Overnight</p>
<p>Da Yun Company, located at 170 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession of this city, is the general manager for the sale of aviation highway construction lottery tickets for the six provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Sichuan. Since the first period until the fifteenth period, the company has repeatedly sold first, second, and third prize winning tickets. The first prize ticket for the fifteenth period, number 185371, was sold by Jin Cheng Bank, which was supplied by Da Yun Company. It is reported that the owner is a Taiping Bank employee who bought two tickets, a certain Mr. from Yan Hua Lou bought two tickets, a Shanghai Municipal Council coolie worker bought one ticket, and a Western woman from 141 Seymour Road bought five tickets. The company's retail store sold one second prize and one third prize ticket, and the mail order department sold one second prize ticket and three third prize tickets. It was found that the second prize ticket sent out by the mail order department went to a Mr. Qiu of Xijie, Shaanxi Road, Chongqing, who had five tickets, a Mr. Gu of Xingan, Jiangxi, who had one ticket, and a Mr. Chen of Guyijie, Haozhou, Anhui, who had four tickets. The most amazing thing is that the third prize ticket number 122252 was distributed to the company's retail store on September 12th. Except for the five tickets that were sold sporadically every day, the remaining five tickets were left. All the ticket buyers felt that the word "two" on the ticket was too much and it was not easy to win the prize, and they looked down upon it. Until the draw day, at 11 am, the tickets were sold out, leaving only five of these tickets. A certain gentleman bought them and put them in his wallet without even looking at the numbers. After the lottery was drawn, he won the third prize. This can be said to be a coincidence. The company's retail and mail order departments are overflowing with tickets for the 16th period. This is due to the frequent big prizes and outstanding credibility. Recently, it has been learned that some stores do not care about their reputation and specialize in printing advertisements to deceive people from other places. The methods are fantastic, so don't believe them lightly. You will be fooled. Da Yun Company is the general agency for sales and there are no mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Lu Chongpeng and Lu Shuyun's Relocation Case: Appeal Changes Judgment, Lu Chongpeng Sentenced to Ten Months with Three Years' Probation <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Lu Chongpeng, a former congressman from Haimen, now resides at No. 1, Lane 98, Grosvenor Gardens in the French Concession and has been a Shanghai resident for several years. He previously lived at No. 24, Qingyun Lane, Rue Ratard, and due to a rent dispute, he was involved in several lawsuits in the Civil Court of the Special Court with the landlord, Yuan Chang Company. After relocating to Grosvenor Gardens on August 4th of this year, he filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Special Court, claiming that the Qingyun Lane landlord Lu Shuyun had obstructed the relocation and damaged antique porcelain. He accused Lu Shuyun of two crimes: restricting freedom and causing damage, and filed a civil suit, requesting a judgment to compensate for the losses. The defendant, Lu Shuyun, also filed a counterclaim for false accusation and obstructing official duties (referring to the plaintiff tearing up the seal during the court's attachment). The initial trial resulted in a judgment that Lu Shuyun was fined twenty yuan and compensated Lu Chongpeng for ten yuan in losses. Lu Chongpeng was found not guilty on the counterclaim. After the judgment was delivered, the defendant Lu Shuyun, dissatisfied with the original judgment, hired lawyer Sun Yuan to file an appeal with the High Court. The plaintiff Lu Chongpeng also appealed, arguing that the original judgment was an inappropriate sentence. Judges Sun Honglin, Wang Tiexiong, and Hui Ping of the High Court held a collegiate hearing on the 24th of last month. Lu Chongpeng did not attend, but Lu Shuyun attended with his defense lawyer. After the hearing, the debate was declared closed, and the date for the judgment was set. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, we learn that the judgment was made the day before yesterday, the main text of which states: the part of the original judgment regarding Lu Shuyun and Lu Chongpeng being not guilty is revoked.

Lu Shuyun is not guilty. Other appeals are rejected. Regarding the incidental civil appeal from both parties, the main text of the judgment states: the part of the original judgment regarding compensation for losses is revoked. Lu Chongpeng's lawsuit and appeal in the first instance are both rejected.

<h3 id="e90">The History Surname Widow-Daughter-in-Law Mutual Lawsuit Case Concluded <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The young widow Ye Cuiying filed a lawsuit in the civil court of the district court, requesting to be separated from her father-in-law Shi Yongkang. Because Ye Cuiying had accused her father-in-law of misconduct in court, Shi Yongkang accused his daughter-in-law of intentional defamation and damage to his reputation. He accused her of loose morals to the court prosecutor's office. The father-in-law and daughter-in-law slandered each other. As a result, Ye Cuiying was given a non-prosecution disposition. The civil part of the case had previously been heard once, but no conclusion had been reached, as detailed in previous reports. It is now learned that this case was heard again yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM by Judge Han Jingji in the second court. Ye Cuiying still attended court with her lawyer Hu Yuanjun and made a statement. Next, Wang Baofeng, the owner of the Wang Dou Ji store, testified that regarding the widow residing in the Shi Yongkang family next door, he and Shi Yongkang, due to their fellow-villager relationship, had advised her to live with her mother-in-law to avoid gossip. Unexpectedly, Shi held a grudge and accused him of having an improper relationship with his daughter-in-law, which was a false accusation. As for giving her stomach medicine, it was medicine left over from his wife's use. The presiding judge then questioned Shi Yongkang for a few words. Since the case was clear, the debate was declared over, and the judgment was scheduled to be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the fifth.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the liquidators of Shanghai Guohuo Co., Ltd. - Hong Yanbin, Wang Jian, Zhang Zilian, Zou Xingsan, Zhang Henghai, etc. - stating that the company's asset-liability situation showed clear signs of being unable to repay debts. In accordance with the provisions of Article 41 of the Bankruptcy Law, they applied for an amicable settlement. After receiving a letter from the company's liquidators confirming that the company's creditors had not applied to the court for bankruptcy, the association submitted it to the 65th Standing Committee meeting for discussion and decided to accept the company's liquidators' application for amicable settlement. A letter was sent to the liquidators, requesting them to submit the books and plans that should be prepared in accordance with Article 7 of the same law. On the 31st of this month, the liquidators submitted the Shanghai Guohuo Company's balance sheet, list of creditors, list of debtors, and amicable settlement plan to the association. It was then submitted to the 67th Standing Committee meeting for discussion and decision to appoint Standing Committee member Ke Ganchen and accountant Xu Yongzuo to review the various books and handle this amicable settlement case. It is reported that the association has sent separate letters to Standing Committee member Ke Ganchen and accountant Xu Yongzuo to jointly handle the matter.</p>

<p>The Candle Industry Guild previously reported that the Fujian Provincial Government was planning to implement a special tax on superstition, with an extremely heavy tax rate, fearing that it would have ramifications. They immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, appealing for an investigation and a request for prohibition. Now, they have received a decree from the Ministry of Finance, No. 7654, which states, "Your telegram has been received. Whether there is such a proposal in the province has not been reported to the Ministry for the record. Regarding the previous situation, we have already consulted the Fujian Provincial Government to investigate and order a halt. Please take note." After receiving this decree, the guild immediately copied and issued the original decree, notifying the industry colleagues in this city and other locations separately.</p>
