<p>— 端</p>
<p>自海外銀價報跌上海金融市塲頓受深刻之刺激金價從幣制改革以還本安定於一千一百四五十元間至是失其常軌一再狂漲曾一度達千二百元有謂銀價下跌不自今始未聞金價有如此之變動此刻獨推波助瀾意者其別有作用歟於是關金放長外匯改縮之說復喧傳於市但觀外匯市塲之形勢近期尚可維持遠期不無見緊加以日商銀行之嫉視應付本覺困難幸有時得英銀行之恊助稍紆遠期之急然以推行未及兩月而定價卽有變動寗不啟人之惶惑况中國改革幣制人人知其阻碍橫生困難重重詎有不熟計審慮於事先而貿然施行之理旣實行矣當必有其準備之力量應付之策略而排萬難以赴之也</p>
<p>羅斯蒞華謂不參預中國改革幣制事而中國適於其時實行改革香港竟赤隨之以俱改此固英金融界所引爲滿意者也今香港之困難已解决中國仍在掙扎奮鬥中乃不先不後銀價之變動又發生於此際美國銀政策豈將有所變更抑故施其壓迫歟此非吾人所能知但美國若果有控制國際貨幣使其穩定之能力則亦吾人之所望也</p>
<p>美國銀政策對於國際貨幣之影饗果何如乎墨西哥自因美國購銀被逼行使紙幣後大多數人民頗感不便近亦有以墨如撤銷使用銀幣禁令墨幣匯市必見堅挺而主張准許銀幣重行流通市面者至在中國美國原冀促進用銀國之購買力而其所得結果乃適相反美貨輸入中國雖仍居第一位但其三季中之貨量已從上年百分之二十六跌至百分之十九日本則自百分之十一增加至百分之十四矣</p>
<p>欲圖經濟復興非先求貨幣穩定不可在國際間亦未嘗不作如是想而實行竟難此無他各有其私見也私見一日不除貨幣之爭一日不息中國　旋於三角式之競爭下亦必深戚其痛苦然而出路何由仍在吾人從本國經濟之立塲自擇之耳</p>

<p>— 俞慶棠主編</p>
<p>桐江東岸的山居　楊衣水</p>
<p>一、叢山峻嶺的桐江東岸山民仍逗</p>
<p>留在半野蠻階段</p>
<p>提起桐江來，大家也許很生疏罷？那末，我們現在先從大家熟悉的上海出發，趁滬杭鐵路的火車到杭州。杭州是在錢塘江的西岸。錢江八月潮，錢塘江這個名字大家也許非常熟悉吧？那末，一我們現在再到這個大家熟悉的錢塘江裏一去旅行一下好不好呢？我們先在杭州僱一葉扁舟。溯錢江而上，只要化半日的工夫，諸位就可以賞玩一下富春江的山水了。假使再前進，我們就可看到江的兩岸有靑綠的高山漸漸的逼近來·兩岸的高山中間，似乎是專爲這條江水留着了空隙。這裏，就是我們要說的桐江了</p>
<p>桐江兩岸有六個縣，西岸是富陽新登桐廬建德，東岸是諸暨浦江。桐廬建德的縣屬是跨着桐江的，我們現在所說的桐江東岸，就是桐建浦三縣交界的地方。</p>
<p>現在我們就在此地舍舟而登陸。</p>
<p>在此地上岸，恐怕諸位一定感覺非常辛苦的—上岸以後沒有黃包車，也沒有轎和馬。以後的路程必須我們自己徒步了。因爲從此前進，擋在我們眼簾前而的滿眼都是山—我們所走的大路，就是夾在這千山萬塢中，或者盤屈在叢山峻嶺上面的羊腸小徑。諸位也許想，我們現在已經走到桃源來了吧？是的—我們是要看一路來隔不到五里或十里遠，就有一家村莊，他們，建築在山脚或者山腰，炊烟時常繚繞在山岩，鷄犬的聲音有時也可送到耳鼓裏來，桃源，眞有點相像—不過，我們略微走近去一看，可又把我們這桃源的印像打破了。那不是人類居住的瓦屋—那是用茅草和蓬蒿蓋成的獸窟呀—這原來不是桃源，是逗留在半野蠻階段的山民世界。</p>
<p>二、山民脚下的一分一寸的土地都</p>
<p>是屬於山主的</p>
<p>山民吃的不是米燒的飯，主要都是苞蘿粉掏成的糊和蕨根沉澱泡成的湯。山田很缺少，穀米自然成爲很珍奇的東西了。佐味的是山地上種起來的菜類，和在山上自然成長起來的野菜。山，對於他們眞是便當呵—他們當然也養猪和鷄，不過這種猪和鷄的肉類，他們自己並不吃。他們養起來做什麽呢？他們也在難得之間種一兩畝山田，田上當然也出穀子的，可是他們也並不自己吃。他們種起來做什麽呢？他們有時往山中去種植或者採發，有時也在自己家中製作工具，他們一身須兼有農人和工匠的本領。可是他們這種種植，採發和製作都並不自由的。這是爲什麼吧？諸位一定耍發生疑問了。</p>
<p>因爲，山民一開出門來，滿眼看見的靑山都不是他們自己的—有許多，甚至連他們住的這個茅草窠也不是他自己的—山中的一草一木，屋上的一椽一瓦（是茅草—），脚下的一分一寸的泥土，都是屬於遠離他們數十里或者百里以外的山主們的呵—</p>
<p>三、山主爲使一點一滴都歸到自己</p>
<p>的倉庫，是豪强的驅役着山民</p>
<p>山主大都住在山嶺並不十分擁擠的，比較空曠的小小平原中。因爲是小小的平原，道路自然也比較平坦。地理形勢造成這種小平原是山居農民進行原始交換的市集。住在這小平原上的山主，多半又是這種市集上的商店主人和小平原上的地主。他們，就是那遠望靑葱，連綿起伏的山脈的主人，也就是這種山居農民的命運主宰者。</p>
<p>山主對於山塲的所有權和地主對於土地的所有權是一樣的。所不同的是：「富家管田，豪家管山。」山主於「富」上面更須加上一點「豪」。因爲在這個地帶的一般情形，山塲對於所有者住家的距離常比土地對於所有者來得遠。爲要使那山上的一點一滴都歸到山主的倉庫裏面來，自然比一般地主非更豪强一些不可。幷且因爲山塲不能同土地一樣的平坦而無遮蔽，疆界淸楚而不混雜，所以爲要使山居農民俯首聽命，也非有凌人的盛氣不行。</p>
<p>高山不能自己把山中的富源送上山主的門來，山主必須有山民到山上去種植，採發，拿到家中來製造，幷且輸送到山主的家中。因此第一步，山主對於山塲必須先作一種選擇：那一處可以種植？那一處可以探發？一般的情形，泥土多而厚者是可以種植苞蘿和桐子的，叫做杉木山，泥士薄而多石者只能利用山中柴木燒炭的，叫做柴　山。山主就是根據這樣的標準以後，再或者租佃給山民去種植，或者命令山民去採發。然後再把天然的財富夾上山民的汗血，成筐成籮的搬運到自己的倉庫裏面來。</p>
<p>經過怎麼樣的一種紐帶來完成這個過程呢？下面我們就來解說這一種山主與山民之間的紐帶，以及這個紐帶所完成的過程。</p>
<p>山主有一塊山，等於地主有一方田，同樣收租。我們前面已經說過了，沒有兩樣。不過山和田有一件是不同的，就是山上的種作不能和田一樣的年年有一熟穫。山上的收穫是一年遞减一年的，到了六七年之後必須把這種已種植的山放荒，恢復山塲的肥沃力。這有點像原始社會的三圃制，生產技術的低下，不知道施肥，等到年久自然要變磽瘠了。這一種情形，從山主的眼中看起來，是山的本利週轉比田來得慢。因此，山的租佃制度也和田有大大的出入·（未完）</p>

<p>出殯情形　黎君逝世之後、醫院卽將遣骸移送殮房、下午二時三十分入殮、三時出殯、由國家醫院發引、葬於薄扶林道西鷄籠環之山麓、戚友致送花圈者甚衆、前往執紼者的數百人、其中多屬港報同人、在永別亭辭靈、是日雨雪霏霏、情景至為悽慘、執紼者念黎君為新聞記者二十年、乃如是慘死、無不十分悲痛、黎君有年邁老母及妻妾子女各一、老母以愛子慘死、慟哭幾至暈厥、</p>
<p>身後蕭條　黎君生平豪邁、戚友求其助者、莫不鼎力維持、月中薪金所入、恒泰半助諸親朋、遂至兩袖淸風、身後蕭條、遺下七旬老母、寡婦孤見、嗷嗷待哺、來日方長、此實人天之極哀、現由港中各報同人、及其各親友發出哀啟、希望黎君親友有所弔賻、悉將祭儀移作現金、俾死者　穸早安、生者亦得其實惠、</p>
<p>被害原因　黎君為人、光明磊落、又極和藹、港中各報同人、無不盡知、亦咸深信黎君確無私仇、然茲何以被兇徒槍擊、據一般觀測、黎君主持之報館、向來對於惡毒勢力、盡量指斥、不留餘地、而港報所處地位、比較的亦能自由紀載、於是遂大招某方當局之忌、而某方當局、對於香港澳門各處之異己份子、則組有特殊機關以處置之、憶香港天南報社長羅偉疆向擁護中央、同時對於某方當局、深致指摘、去年乃有被人槍擊之舉、黎雖無擁護中央言論、但對某方當局已旣亦不滿、則此决被害、自與羅於去年被槍擊、可謂相同、特羅倖生而黎竟死、則有幸有不幸耳、</p>

<p>羅馬通信、根據國聯盥的實施之經濟制裁運動、已於十一月十八日起、正式開始實行、此次經濟制裁之能施諸事實、英國在日內瓦主動之力最大、蓋爲國人所共知、其所根據而宣布之理由、則為極動聽聞之[制載侵略行爲]、惟當我國東北四省遭人蹂躪之時屢請國聯實施制裁、未聞伸張正義如英國者、當時有所聲言、今日之局、亦為列强權益有所衝突、乃利用此日內瓦之機關以為應付對方工具而已、雖足以設一先例、可為吾人後日要求國聯諸會員國對侵略吾國者亦實施制裁之根據、但就目前之運動言、是吾立足於正義之上、實猶為極大疑問也、茲且不再論其運動之背景如何、倘照目前實施之經濟制裁而言、意大利所受之影響實甚巨大、蓋意大利立國於半島之上、僅聯接法奧瑞三國邊界處之龍巴地一帶為平原、其餘非為山地、卽為瘠士、礦源旣缺乏、原料生產又極稀少、仰給於國外輸入者至巨、目下國聯會員國中、除奧·匈·阿爾巴尼亞·烏拉圭四國以外、其餘三十八國均參加無保留之對意經濟制裁、另有十三國對意實施有保留之經濟制裁、依照經濟制裁之原則言、均不能將原料礦產品輸入意大利、倘就全世界之生產觀察、重要原料產於對意實施制裁之國家者如决、就上列數字觀察、則知意大利所需要之上述原料鑛產、大致均在對意實施經濟制裁之國家中、多者百分之百、少者百分之七十三、至就煤興媒油而言、去年意大利進口之媒共一萬萬一千七百八十餘萬昆打、其中主要輸入國為英德波蘭三國、又進口之媒油共一百五十餘萬昆打、其中主要輸入國為蘇聯·波斯·羅馬尼亞·美國、又汽油輸入額共三百四十八萬見打、其中主要輸入國為羅馬尼亞、荷屬東印度、波斯與羅馬尼亞、除美德非國聯會員外、其餘均爲參加對意實施經濟制裁者、目下有添列煤與煤油於制裁表內之議、則所加於意大利之打擊者更將巨深、昨日意大利外交部曾通知各國駐意使館、所有以前可以免稅購買之煤油·汽油·糖·咖啡等·均須由各國使館直接向國外購買、自十二月十五日起、不能再在意大利境內免稅購買、此種辦法、一方為報復對意實施經濟制裁國家之初步舉動、同時亦所以節省其國內已存貨物之施用、蓋汽油之應用、攸關軍事飛機、工業活動及交通運輸者極巨、苟有一日來源斷絕較之食糧斷絕影饗允巨、乃所以有此大恐慌也、</p>

<p>自京來滬</p>
<p>前任外交次長兼中央政治會秘書長唐有壬氏、自最近六中全會、及五全大會閉幕、中央政府各院部長改選後、卽行卸職、現復改任交部常務决長及外部顧問、甫於二十三日晚乘夜快車、前晨自京蒞滬、仍寓法租界甘世東路甘村第二三五號私邸、</p>
<p>訪汪精衛</p>
<p>唐氏於前　日早晨抵滬歸寓後、當日下午卽往安和寺路訪注精衛氏、旋卽返寓、至昨晨九時、氏又乘車外出、（租界第六九三四號華界第三一五〇號）仍先訪汪氏、午刻返寓進餐、至下午一時許復出、先至愚園路、探視親友後、復至巨籟達路七〇五號新任鐵道部長張公權處、</p>
<p>車返甘邨</p>
<p>唐氏與張公權密談頗久、至四時三刻左右辭出、卽命車夫駛歸寓所、待車抵甘邨甬道口、因唐宅位於弄內第三家坐南面北、而弄內寬度不及一丈、汽車不能轉頭、故唐之汽車駛抵弄口時、復將車倒退入弄、待車退抵後門、氏卽從容下車、</p>
<p>暴徒夾攻</p>
<p>唐氏下車之後、卽叩後門兩下、但無人啟門、是時唐之幼公子在內、聞聲卽大聲詢問日、「爸爸回來了嗎、」唐答、「是的、」不料唐話未答完、已由車前車後竄出身着灰黃色馬褲呢大衣之暴徒兩人、袖出手槍、直向唐氏兩面夾攻、氏一見不妙、乃急轉身大踏步繞上水門汀階台、擬逃入二樓後門、</p>
<p>雙槍齊發</p>
<p>唐宅後門水泥　台、共有十三級、直達二層後門、當時唐氏方跨登第三級、兩暴徒已迫不及待、對準氏雙槍齊發、共開八九槍之多、唐氏距離不到五步、故週身共中三槍、且均屬要害、惟氏究屬壯年、終於撑支步登階巔、猛繫後門、大聲呼救、詎事有凑巧、蓋當唐氏一下汽車叩喚樓下後門、同時唐之幼子大聲詢問時、二樓適有一戚婦已聞得唐叩樓下後門、滿以唐已從樓下後門而入、决不料及唐於樓下遇暴、而逃登二樓、</p>
<p>奄奄一息</p>
<p>直待戚婦　聞得連珠槍聲及唐在門外呼救聲、始知不妙、再待援鈕啟門、而唐已不支踣入後門矣、同時唐之失人歐陽立微（卽名劇家歐陽予倩之胞妹）正因連日偶威不適、危坐床上、突聞槍聲、知有變故、再待趿履奔出、而唐已倒臥血泊中、一見夫人、僅能啟口示意、一息奄奄矣、</p>
<p>兇手脫逃</p>
<p>當時唐之汽車夫目擊暴徒開槍、已嚇得目瞪口呆、待暴徒出奔逃逸後驚魂稍定、始下車奔報甘世東路轉角一越捕、再待該捕趕到、而暴徒已鴻飛冥眞矣、此時唐夫人急將唐先扶上汽車、飛送牛惠霖醫院、經牛醫生診察後、以三槍均屬要害、計一彈自右脇入左腋出、一彈由右腰進未洞穿、一彈從右臀射入、洞穿左胯、牛醫生斷定已無生望、</p>
<p>傷重殞命</p>
<p>遂命急送廣慈醫院、而該院因無捕房人員伴同送往、拒絕收納、不得已乃又轉送盧家灣總巡捕房、此時唐氏眼球、僅作最後一瞥、卽吿傷重殯命、捕房見唐氏已死、遂囑送至台拉斯脫路工部局醫院（卽小病房）昇入附設之騐屍所、候報請第二特院派員蒞騐、</p>
<p>嚴緝兇手</p>
<p>法捕房於出事之後、特派中西探員馳往唐宅嚴密查勘、將暴徒所有擊落彈壳、逐一檢拾、存案備查、並據汽車夫聲稱、當時兇手確有三人、僅兩人動手、於出事之前數小時、曾有目擊一紅色之轎車、久停該處、待出事之後、車卽不見、同時市長吳鐵城、亦得報吿、卽派秘書耿嘉基先赴唐宅慰唁、復往法總領事署曁法捕房耍求嚴緝在逃兇手、一面由市府令飭市公安局協力嚴緝、同時唐宅電吿中央及唐之胞兄卜年·乃弟圭良、來滬主持喪務、</p>

<p>福新各廠亦為榮宗敬氏所經營，王禹卿王堯臣兄弟等亦係大股東，為我國麵粉業之重鎭，出品多寡，與巿塲頗有關係。該廠出品原有寶星，福壽，漁翁等牌，嗣因其銷路不及「兵船」暢逹，遂一律改為「兵船」。銷路以天津為主，長江一帶沿海各省，以及南洋各地，亦有大量銷額，往年該廠營業旺盛時，每年可銷麵粉二千餘萬包，近年來因東北失陷之影響，平均已减為一千七百萬包右右。去年粉價稍漲，獲利較豐，如一，三，六，七四廠盈餘共逹一百五十萬元。本年九日間，福新一廠及其他分廠，因內地小麥不能源源運到，原料頓告缺乏，曾一度停工，為時約有一月，至前月初始告復工。</p>

<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>三，麪粉業之原料—　—麥</p>
<p>麵粉業之原料即為小麥。我國生產小麥之主要區域在黃河諸省。近年來因天災人禍之侵襲，收獲量大形减少。據中央農業實騐所調查所得，全國小麥產量廿一年為四一·一一二萬擔，廿二年三九·六二〇萬担，廿三年為四三·五一八擔萬，去年雖較以往兩年略增，但對十足收獲年成而言，仍僅佔百分之六十八。我國本為農業國家，按獲小麥一項，可以不必仰賴外國，然而上海之麵粉廠家有時亦須兼購洋麥者，即因國產不足故也。此外國內交通不便，遠處小麥不能及時運抵上海，亦為一主要原因。據海關統計，自民國十二年始，小麥皆年年入超，今將已往三年及本年為首三季之入超數列表如次，以供參考：（單位關金）</p>
<p>全國　上海一埠</p>
<p>廿一年　四一、五四三、一三五　三一、二二六、八一六</p>
<p>廿二年　四五、〇六二、五四三　三五、九四二、七四九</p>
<p>廿三年　一五、六五九、〇二六　一四、〇一三、七二二</p>
<p>本年為首三季　一七、〇二五、二四五　未詳</p>
<p>輸入小麥之國家，以美國為最多，加拿大澳洲次之。惟此種舶來之小麥，有時因來價較昂，上海廠家購以製粉不甚合算，故每逢內地歉收，運輸又不須利之際，上海廠家，仍難免停工之苦。據本年九月廿五日某報載，福新一廠即因內地小麥來源减少，原料缺乏，而中止製造，其他如福新八廠及立大等廠，當時亦有停工之虞。但民族製粉廠家一旦停工，洋粉輸入之機會必更倍增，此我人所應注意者也。</p>
<p>小麥產粉能力，隨其種類不同而互異。大致美國小麥每百斤毛麥可製粉七十六七斤，麩皮二十二斤，白麥可製粉七十四五斤，麩皮二十二斤，澳洲紅麥可製粉七十五六斤，麩皮二十三斤。本國所產之小麥，因素質較差，每百斤僅能製粉七十斤，麩皮二十三四斤。製粉業之之副產麩皮，往昔僅用以飼養牲畜，銷路亦限於江浙二省。近來日人善加利用，製成麵筋及調味食品，功用增大，銷路亦漸廣，惟仍以日人購用為多。</p>
<p>美麥分白皮紫皮兩種，澳麥則為紅皮，土麥皮色帶黃，其素質亦互有優劣。白皮質鬆而皮薄，製粉潔白，然少麵粉筋質。紫皮質實體小，粉色稍遜，而筋力較强紅皮質實皮厚，粉色與紫皮者相同。黃皮質實體小，製粉光潔，並不亞於紫紅兩種，筋質又最强，約佔百分之四五十，其他美澳坎各種小麥僅及百分之四十。至所含雜質，紅紫兩種最少，約二斤，白麥次之，約四斤，土麥最雜，多至六斤，此土麥之最大缺點。如我人以後能設法改良，則產粉之原料，當能獨立自給也。</p>
<p>四，麥價及粉價之　消長</p>
<p>近年來上海之麥價粉價，時有漲落。小麥巿價二十一年略高，二十二年較低，去年又稍回漲，本年為首數月與去年半載無甚上下，惟新貨幣政策實施後，上漲之勢校為猛烈。至粉價之升降，大體與麥一致，不若紗花之間有顯著之距離。茲根據中行月刋每月所列之統計，製成一表，以便查覽：</p>
<p>近四年來上海麥巿粉巿統計表</p>
<p>小麥　麥粉</p>
<p>二十一年　二十二年　二十三年　二十四年</p>
<p>一月　三·九一　四·一三　三·二七　三·九二</p>

<p>十一月　三·九二　三·三九　三·八五　……</p>
<p>十二月　四·一〇　三·五四　三·九六　……</p>
<p>此外新幣制實行以後，對於麵粉巿價，發生如何之促進力最，亦為値得注意之問題。據國定稅則委員會所編上海物價指數，十月號及十一月號所載，其增漲頗為迅速請參閱下表：</p>
<p>二十年　二十二年　二十三年　二十四年</p>
<p>二·六〇三　二·七四二　二·一五〇　二·四五七</p>
<p>……　二·五三三　二·一五〇　二·四一二</p>
<p>……　二·四六九　二·〇八二　二·三六一</p>
<p>……　二·四三一　二·〇五六　二·四二四</p>
<p>……　二·四一〇　一·九七九　二·四六七</p>
<p>二·六三六　二·三六〇　二·〇四九　二·三五四</p>
<p>二·五五八　二·三〇九　二·二四七　二·三五八</p>
<p>二·六八〇　二·二五四　二·六一六　二·三八五</p>
<p>二·六七七　二·二九二　二·三三九　二·四五七</p>
<p>二·五八六　二·一一〇　二·二七九　二·七二〇</p>
<p>二·五三三　二·一四八　二·四一〇　……</p>
<p>二·六四八　二·二三二　二·四八九　……</p>
<p>註：單位元，小麥以百斤計算，麥粉以每袋（計四十九磅）計算。</p>
<p>本年上海麥粉巿價，由八月之　二·三八五元增為九月之二·四五七元，十月更增為二·七二元，相差逹四角左右。此中原因及其影響，粉業巨擘榮宗敬氏曾有肯切之說明，今節引於後：</p>
<p>「近月來因各省水災影響，小麥原料减少，而外國原棉亦因價格高昂，成本過鉅，頗不合算，兼之歐洲意阿風雲，頗形緊張，各國均無貨出口，故我國麵粉，價格步步高漲。本人經營之廠，將於本月底全部停工，蓋因缺乏原料也。麵粉為民食不可少之物，今如此高漲，對於國民生生計，所關淺云。</p>
<p>麵粉牌號　十月十五日　十一月十五日</p>
<p>綠乒船牌　二·七〇五·　二·九八三</p>
<p>老車牌　二·七〇五　二·九八三</p>
<p>雙馬牌　二·六七五　二·九五〇</p>
<p>金鐘牌　二·六五〇　二·九二五</p>
<p>紅日當天牌　二·七〇〇　二·九七五</p>
<p>註：麵粉以每袋計價，單位元。</p>
<p>粉價如此上漲，對於廠商或有相當利益，但對於一般國民生泩或不無相當困難。故吾人一方固須注意新貨幣政策之推行，同時亦須兼顧物價高漲之如何調節也。　（完）</p>

<p>一、敎育行政戰時工作計劃、二、大學戰時工作計劃、三、高中戰時工作計劃、四、初中戰時工作計劃、五、小學戰時工作計劃、六、民校戰時工作計劃、</p>
<p>一、教育行政戰時工作計劃</p>

<h3 id="c160">一九三五—五六年籃球親規則　對於籃球訓練上之影響（下） <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 美國魯比著　錢一勤譯</p>
<p>第三圖示另一著名進攻方法、因此項三秒鐘新規則之施行而失其效用者、四號傳給一號、一號回給四號、四號再給再號、一號再回給四號、四號在每次前進時、均假作欲穿過及長射之姿勢、但依照此項新規則、一號僅得接球及傳與四號一次之時間、</p>
<p>許多球隊改用雙樞紐進攻法、尤其當一隊有高大之球員人及矮小敏捷善於遠射之球員三人時、變於用此、第四圖示一雙樞紐進攻法、山此式可變化若干方式、此種進攻法均可避免違方犯一秒鐘之規則、然在前方進攻者僅得應用三人故對方離球較遠之防衛工作可稍放鬆、如第四圖ＣＡ兩球員之行動示者然、</p>
<p>在美國西方中部趨向　於五圖所示之進攻方式、因將籃前區域開放、球員得突進該區內投籃、藉以使一隊避免　犯二秒鐘之規則、許多分區聯防法之兩點、盡在罰球區域之內、今後分區聯防法之採用必較昔日為多、此乃當然之趨勢、疑、</p>
<p>因幾部分之要求、允其於太平洋沿岸一帶、全美籃球規則委員會已局部允如所請、業將中圈跳球取消、其原文如决、「因侵人犯規擲中罰球之後、球須由被罰之一隊自塲之端綫外任何地點拋入、當球拋入球塲時、重行繼續計算時間、斯時裁判員無須取球過手、」（註三）</p>
<p>此項規則之施行從前中圈球跳百分之五千恐將被淘汰、因此為敎練員者不能若已往之多費時間練習中國進攻之方式、而將該部時間用於訓練因侵人犯規擲中罰球後、如何迅速之進攻、設甲隊擲中因侵人犯規之罰球後、乙隊之後衛或中鋒迅速持球立於塲之端錢外、及拋給其同隊之前鋒、作迅速之反攻、此項反攻極或不克獲得特殊之成效、但至少亦可使甲隊球員因有所顧慮而迅速退回防守、致其當投籃不中之際得較少之機會獲球、</p>
<p>乙隊之迅速反攻得因甲隊於擲中罰球以後、將球獲取而延遲之、是項延遲之程度如何非迨本季正式新規則問世、無從知曉、然據籃球遊戲之局勢一書第二百九十八局勢所載云、一甲隊一號完成擲中罰球後、於是球判歸乙隊自塲端拋入、但因甲隊欲得充份之時間、藉以組成其防守陣式、甲隊　號將球擊至坐位之下、規則—裁判員有權宣吿因不合運動道們之行為、一决技術犯規、」</p>
<p>（十五章弟一條第四例）</p>
<p>歷年來許多敎練員感覺正當擲籃中的前之犯規、球員應有權拒絕受罰、惟若是之規則勢必極難執行、一丸三五—三六年之規則明示此類之擲中均應計算、然自被犯規之時刻起直至投籃中的時止、投籃球員之動作必須連續不斷、倘其在嗚笛後、重新有所舉動、則擲中之球亦不計算、故就教練員少觀點而言、此項更改將變更遊戲之校術、</p>
<p>新規則中更改最聰明之一條為「促球不穩而連球續促之不得調為運球」與一當一球員在空中拍一次或多决、藉以使球避免其他球員之爭奪時、運球之動作不得謂為開始」在已往因為此項奮規則、比賽每於敏捷防衛之阻礙後、以致遲緩、此項新規則足使比賽之進行更加迅速、</p>
<p>罰球區域圓圈之中斷處將延成整圓形、使在罰球綫上之跳球時、該圈成為禁錮之圓圈、為避免常有之擁擠起見、所有球員除跳球員外、均須立於該圈外、直至球被拍擊為止、</p>
<p>此項規則將使裁判員之工作加易、因此裁判員帶球至此區域內拋擲、將較前更多、故敎練員勢將訓練在此區域內之固定跳球得分之方法、是故聰明之舉也、</p>
<p>新規則上亦會釋明違犯中圈跳球之罰則、在他項新規則中有一條為、替補員當報吿裁判員及記錄員時、須將其號數·職位·以及其對手之號數、如屬可能、</p>
<p>再則、每半時二十分鐘之比賽、其間須有十五分鍊之休息期、替代十分鐘、此項更改將使敎練員設法在休息期間內作相當之球藝表演、藉助觀衆之淸興、</p>
<p>雖有其他不少之細微更改、然在本季未開始前敎練員之訓練計劃上、其影響極微、（註一）（註三）一九三五—三六年籃球規則更改綱要</p>

<p>送禮的對方，因為是富有感情的，所以先得要替對方着想，倘使隨便拿些不中用的東西，束搬西移，結果往往把甲家送的禮，由乙丙而丁而戊，仍舊還到甲家，那麼送禮原來是聯絡情誼的，這樣反給人家不快，還不如不送的好呢。目下人人都是喜歡國貨，假使我偏把外國貨送人，不但取人厭惡，並且被人輕視。人們交誼的厚薄，本在精神神，不在物質，倘使不量個人財力，死要面子，送了很厚的禮物，在對方受之難安，並且惹人疑惑，也是無益有損。人家公認心理學，是一稱專門學問，可是任何階級，都該研究研究。送禮要研究對方的心理。不送禮便罷，送禮而不去研究對方的心理，不是蠢夫，便是笨伯。　　送禮以後，對方一定要答謝了，普通有句話，「却之不恭受之有愧。」人家送了禮物，收受的好呢？璧謝的好呢？倒是一個問題。交情深的，受之無妨。交情淺的却之有理。不過送了不中用的外國貨，簡直可以全璧歸趙，還可以敎訓他幾句。如果送禮的入，另有作用，另有目的，那麼，受之有愧，却之為宜。古人有「誼重何妨薄禮，情眞不在繁文。」確是至理名言。</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>讀本月十九日第一四五期國貨週刋「新年送禮專號」上期，勢必再有下期，爰將籌成對於送禮之意見，略述一二如下：仰葊先生謂「送禮不在厚薄，而在適用與不適用，不在多少，而在需要與不需要」，確係至理名言。予生平最怕送禮，蓋不需要之物，送者徒耗金錢，受老一無所用，照禮尙往來之說，越數日，受老卽變為送者，亦欲購物答還，送者變為受者，亦感覺多此一舉，雙方交受其害。故予民國年結婚後，携眷赴京口之前三日，卽遍告親友，萬勿送禮，否則一槪不答，結果王哲甫表弟，仍送醬鴨等路菜，予老實不客氣，至年底返來時，並未購物答還，因是少了許多麻煩。近數年來，滬友雖間有送禮與予，但予亦從未答還；不過各人送予之禮，使予常在腦際而不忘者，計有下列諸君：　十年冬，予丁內艱時，沈九成君贈予三友實業社二一二自由呢棉袍一件，是年因有孝服，不穿綢面皮袍，卽禦此衣過冬，次年一二八之役，十九路軍退守崑山後，蘇州風鶴頻驚，予繞道返蘇接眷，因京滬路早斷，擬乘輸至嘉興，改乘滬杭車來申，乘客擁擠，船泊閶門河當中，夜半上船，失足墮於河內，因是衣棉花多而上浮，未及於難，無意中竟救予一命。　前年冬，方劍閣君贈予中華琺瑯廠所出之立鶴牌面盆兩隻茶盤一對，痰盂兩個，卽携至蘇州以供家用，花色美麗，式樣靈巧，經久耐用，每决回蘇盥洗與品茗時，一見此物，卽欲想到方君之盛意。　許曉初君今春與予同應王曉籟王延松裴雲卿三君之邀，游紹回來，道經杭州，曾勾留三天，每日下雨；許君購一紙傘贈予，遂日持此傘暢游三竺六橋間，興趣甚濃，頗為得用。　今歲中秋，與孫嗚歧賢伉儷加入友聲旅行團而赴嘉興，游烟雨樓落帆亭三塔寺諸名勝，上午天氣奇熱，下午忽然大冷，寒暑表相去三十餘度，僅穿印度綢長衫，身冷難受；幸任士剛君贈予五和織造廠所製之鵝牌棉毛衫，得以抵禦，而未受凍。　今秋袁鶴松君贈予三和醬菜兩罐，帶至蘇寓，適値內子松如產後，對於魚肉葷腥，嫌其油膩而不欲食，一見此物，視為珍品，大吃特吃，讚不絕口。　周邦俊君前日贈予膠木蓋熱水瓶以及香烟盒香烟盤各一，均以膠木所製，携歸蘇庽，瓶則每日送飯至學校，灌水以供洗臉，盒與盤，則置於會客窒內，以充裝飾品，來客會讚其式樣精巧，而合於日用。以上諾君所贈之物，均係國貨；價不甚貴，而頗適用，故使予迄今未忘，可見送體眞不在厚薄與多少上着想，應注意「適用與需要」四字耳。</p>

<p>— 管廷鎭</p>
<p>吾人生存於社會問，免不了與人接觸，因接觸而發生戚情作用，結果免不了要送禮，所謂禮尙往來是也，送禮可分作兩種說法，一種對於親戚問的送禮，此種所送的禮品，多以風俗為轉移，然大致終是呆板的幾種，用不着多說，另一種就是朋友間的送禮，其中尙可分為成年的與兒童的（包括親戚的子女），此種所送的禮品，初無一定之限制，但也有個相當的範圍，大槪對於成年人的送禮，趨重於吃的方面，對於兒童的？有送吃的也有送玩的，我現在這裏所要談的就是對於兒童的禮品問題，且着重於玩具方面的，小孩子富於模仿性，無論別人的一舉一動，他終要看樣學習，所以一個人長成後能够這樣？祗看他幼年時的這樣看樣學習好了。那沒對於送兒童的禮物，豈不要特別注意才行？歐美各國，對於兒童的禮物，非常關心，他們所送的，大都含有科學意味的，如積木，火車及飛機等，又有整套小形的工藝用具，使小孩在玩的時候，無形中灌輸科學常識，記得有一决至租界某公園，見有數多外國小孩在池中比賽船，一在園的一角，又見另外的一羣用小鐵剷剷地上的泥，其中幾個，很忙的用小鉛一筒向池中汲水，以便注入穴中成一假池，此種遊戲，他們習以為常，所以長大了以後，就易成個科學的人材，但我國小孩平常所玩的，不是向糖果攤賭錢便是與人打罵，很少用科學玩具來遊戲的，所以長成以後，徒成個社會的消費老而已，目下我國對於兒童的科學遊戲，亦漸注意，製造此種玩具的工廠，也日見增加，其中出品最多而定價最廉的，當首推商務書館中華書局康元製罐廠等，他們年終，對於此種玩具，例有特別廉價，以便為家長者購作兒童禮物之用，他如很有趣珠的兒童盡報小說故事等書籍，他們也一同廉價出售，裝置很精雅，也可購作送禮之需，至於送給兒童的糖果等，如南市之蓬萊市塲及南京路之國貨公司曁總商會之國貨商塲，均應有盡有，可以配購，倘或須其他特別禮品而為該商塲等所未經售者，則可逕函詢中國國貨公司，他們定有滿意的答覆，切不可購用外洋貨來替代，因為這是外國人所引以為恥的。</p>
<h3 id="c170">合理化的新年禮品 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>光陰如箭，日月如梭，時光像流水般的過去，一剎那，民國二十五年的新年，又將降臨了。時間的迅速，眞使我們發生無限的感想！</p>
<p>當這新年行將到來而還沒有降臨的時候，我們翻開新聞紙來看看，有不少的廣吿，大都是刋載着「新年禮品」幾個使人觸目的大字，同時，再看看在大街小巷中的行人，其中也有不少是拿着新年的禮品，去送給他親戚和朋友的，由於這種感覺，我覺得申報國貨週刋的編老仰葊先生，在今天特出新年禮品專號，的確是一伴需要的事。因為送禮這一件事，在表面上看來，似乎是一種小道，而然，細細的研究起來，其中也很有商討的餘地，和研究的價値呢？照我的見解看來，合理化的新年禮品，是應該合乎下列三項原則的：</p>
<p>甲。國貨的：當然喲！這是不一容諱言的，當這提倡國貨的聲浪，高唱得如入雲霄的時候，我們對於一切服用之所需，當然應該購買國貨，新年送禮，是人與人之間的一種交際，又怎樣可以例外呢？所以我們對於購置新年禮品，第一個原則，便是要注意是吾國貨？凡是國貨的東西，就是價錢稍微貴些，我們也要忍痛購買，反之，凡是不是國貨的出品，雖然價錢非常便宜，我們也不可因為價廉而購之，當此嚴冬，我們如果能拿眞正的國貨（如鄕間鷄蛋之類）來作新年的禮品，一定可以受人歡迎，因為這種東西，不特是道地的東西，而且還是冬令的大補品呢？再進一步講：對於農村民衆的生活，還可以予以相當的帮助呢？</p>
<p>乙·　二需要的：贈送禮品，不特要注意是吾國貨？而且還要顧到被送者的需耍問題，一件人家不需要的東西，雖然送去，還是置之高擱，不切實用，換一句話說：假如我們能測騐對方的心理，觀察對方的需要，而把實用的禮品送去，那末，一定可以使人得到滿意，而收到極大的好感。套一句酸文說起來：這樣的送禮法，正是「事半而功倍」的新禮哲學呢？</p>
<p>丙·耐用的：除了上述二項原則之外，末了我覺得「耐用」字，也是我們在致送新年禮品的時侯，應該要顧到的一點。因為我們假如致送禮品，只求表面，不求實質，這樣的禮品，用了不久，就要失其效用，是非常不經濟的·所以，我們當此致送新年禮品的時候，除了一切食品化妝品等等之外，凡是實用的東西，務須注意到「耐用」的條件，這也是購置新年禮品，不可不注意的地方。</p>
<h3 id="c171">送禮的小經騐 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 浦曼彬</p>
<p>男主人事情忙，顧不到瑣屑事，這送禮問題，當然屬於主婦的責任範圍，吾把幾年來送禮的小經騐貢獻一些：我們送的禮物，可以分做衣，食，日用玩具四方面，食的和玩的固然是小孩子所歡迎，可是也要不妨礙衛生和不傷物力。我往常送人玩的玩具吃的東西，總是合於衛生和富有意義的。所以敎育玩具，如商務中華康元等廠的出品，我是一個老主顧。冠生園的衛生食品，也是時常光顧的。最近偶然到三友實業社買布，知道他們的糯米粉，眞蜂蜜，和向來出名的西湖藕粉，都是極好的食品，允其在冬令很合衛生。我買了送給親友，都是十分歡迎。不過有許多極知已極經濟的親友，吾還要從衣料方面做些工夫·王家雨個男孩子，吾剪了二件三友自由布制服送他十分高興，李家兩位小姐，吾買了國貨公司鴻新出品的耕雲錦國光呢二段布料，她們歡喜得讚不絕口·周家一位少奶奶，送了五和的兩件棉毛衫，她特地打電話請問吾五和的地點在那兒。再就日用品上設想想陸家太太是多子女的吾送了他一對立鶴面盆一隻火油爐，她便給他兩個上中肄業的兒子。朱小姐快出閣了，吾便就中國化學工業社，家庭工業社，永和實業社三家的上號出品，挑選了十伴，當做小小的人情。張梅芳小姐和楊君五表弟訂婚，吾便託亞光，電木廠做了一百隻茶葉匣子，每個匣蓋上嵌了五朶梅花，叫做五梅之喜。前天小孩子從學校裏回來，說許多同學都不刷牙齒，吾便買了一打一心小牙刷，叫她分贈小朋友。吾無意間看見陳阿林襪子破了，他母親早早去世，父親又在外省，吾便替他買了長菊牌子兩雙，五卅牌毛襪子兩雙，送給這可憐的孩子。每到夏天，吾必到五洲桑房，買了許多藥品，送給鄕間親友，當為夏令家中的必備藥品。朱家嫂嫂一天到晚替她八個孩子洗衣，吾便送了她無敵香皂二打，她說她平日最喜歡用固本皂和無敵皂，我的親戚某女士發了神經病，吾一天聽戚飯牛先生講孟子，無意間知道三友社的馬賓，很有效騐，吾便買了兩元送她試試目下居然好了，人家說吾這件禮物，是無價之寶。吾覺得用國貨送人，都是很有價値的。</p>

<p>— 菊菊</p>
<p>光陰眞似跑馬般的過去，一霎眼又已到了新年，在這未來的新年裏，因為沿着習慣的緣故，每有多少人家，互相餽賣禮品，所謂「禮尙往來…………」一年一度必有些送禮的舉動，但是談到送禮，那末必須投其所好，雖是輕得微乎其微，這也是一些人情意思，古語道「千里送鵝毛，禮輕情意重」，那便是一個很好的例子，</p>
<p>現在來談談我家的送禮，緣我家親戚很多，大都散居外埠，一到了年尾歲首，有的買些禮品來探慰，但是就他們（或我們）送來的禮品中間，我最喜歡的，就是那些國貨的日用品，像什麼三友實業社出品的毛巾，被單，衣料等，五和廠的鵝牌衛生衫，襪子，絨繩等，我都愛用，一則牠是純粹的國貨，我們中國人應當爰用中國貨，二則牠很長久耐用，如三友社的毛巾，自由布，印花單等，都永久不退顏色，花紋呢？精美絕倫，用途呢？耐久經用，但是我有幾家親戚，他們為討好起見，便去買那些舶來品的禮品來送我，其實我反而不歡迎。這樣一來顯出他們媚外的心理，但是我表面上，因了人情的關係，不好怎樣，實際上呢，一方面很客氣的璧謝，一方面便揀了幾樣國貨的禮品，送給他（或她），這樣一來，他們要送我的，那非國貨的禮品不辦了。</p>
<p>談到送禮有了小孩的，最好禮品中，分置兩樣喫的禮品，現在冠生園的各種糖果—却很好不亞於來路貨的我存每年送禮的物品中，分置了一二，以示獎勵兒童們，對於喫的，也要服用國貨的心理。</p>
<p>那末，我倒要奉勸各家的主婦們，在送禮的當兒，先要事前預計誰家送的什麼禮品，誰家要送些什麼，那末，必定要實用些的，大都以國貨為主。</p>

<p>— 賈觀軍</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快，一本很厚的日曆，已經撕得沒有幾張了，二十五年將要很快的結束，二十五年將要很快地跟着來了。在這二十四年的歲尾，我們都要打算新年的禮品，餽送我們的親戚朋友，這是年年免不了的一伴事啊！</p>
<p>在以前過去的許多新年裏，我們餽送親友的禮品，不外乎糖果·火腿·年糕·醃肉·鮮魚·彩蛋等幾種吃的東西。各地餽送親友新年禮品，形式儘管不同，內容總是差不多的。我以為新年所送的禮品，應當送些日用的禮品，因為新年裏吃的東西很多，如果我們再送給吃的東西，未免太多了。</p>
<p>我把新年裏應送的禮品，一一的寫在下面，旣可把以前的惡習改去，並且可以提倡我國的國貨。</p>
<p>土布是新年餽送親友最好的一種禮品，顏色很是文雅，質料非常的堅固，如果把這布做成衣服，穿在身上，很是樸素，並且可以表示你是個愛用國貨的人·這種土布，可向三友社，鴻新布廠，上海土布公司等購買，價也不貴，眞是價廉而物美。</p>
<p>套鞋也是新年餽送親友最好的一種禮品，下雨時可以穿着，晴天時也可以穿着，實一舉兩得。海上製造這種用品的工廠很多，共中價廉物美的，當然推「大中華橡膠廠」的雙錢牌套鞋，堅固耐穿，而且形式優美。穿在脚上，舒服而漂亮。</p>
<p>而盆　也是新年餽送親友最好的　一種禮品，也是我們每天三餐不可缺少一的用具。製造面盆的廠家很多：像中華一·久新·鑄豐琺瑯廠等數家，這三家中，當然耍算「中華琺瑯廠」最好，因為他製的面盆，上面的琺瑯質很多，所以非常堅固，商標是一隻立的鶴。　　上述三種物品，是新年餽送親友最好的幾種禮品。希望各地的人士，都來購買，直接可以節省無謂的消耗，間接可以振興我國的國貨。一舉兩得，何樂而不為呢？</p>

<h3 id="c177">民族的悲哀 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 林一新</p>
<p>最近因外患不斷的侵襲，中國的民族，已受着最嚴重的迫害。但是這還不是眞正的民族的悲哀，歷史上不乏許多例子，證明一個民族在重重壓迫之下掙扎起來。眞正的悲哀，却是在民族存亡危念的時候，沒有一個有頭腦的×先見的人，指出解放的道路；更其悲哀的，允其是民族臨到傾覆的前夕，竟然在一廣大的民族」中問，引不起任何的反饗。</p>
<p>我記得黑格爾在十九世紀德意志被拿破侖侵入的時候，說過以下的話：「只有知識是唯一的救星，唯有知識能够使我們對於事變之來不致如禽獸一般之蠢然吃驚，亦不致用急智以敷衍應付目前的一時。……」黑格爾這句話，實是永不磨滅的眞理。一個民族在受壓迫的時候，自己能够知道武裝起自己的武器，那他尙可以抵抗，抵抗的失敗，那是事實相互力量關係的問題，道是可以依靠我們的努力的。最悲哀的，就是一開始就沒有「武裝」——換言之，即對於一個民族所處的資史時代及其解放途徑，沒有正確的和科學的知識，因此，即使使要圓反抗，都沒於何等的自信力；且即起來反抗，也至多不過是「應付一時」的無信念之盲目行動。——而且在一般上說，反抗不會有的，因為牠是需要廣大的民族力量，沒有一定的全般的解放道路之了解和認識民族力量是集聚不起來的。</p>
<p>中國現在的處境，正是這樣。我以為這是他的悲哀。中國現在騐着一種事變，整個民族如弔在空中，除了聽形勢自然的發展外，沒有一個人知道他應該向那裏走。僅僅知道某種事物，某種勢力是衆惡，是敵人，是沒有用的；僅僅知道反抗，也是沒有用處。究竟中國民族的發展和他的內部機構，達到何種的情形，以及這等情形怎樣和外部的力量，發生最複雜的相互關係，都沒有一個人知道。但在這些中間正包含着重要的關鍵，任何一個民族在生存着，他內部都包存有巨大的力量，但是這些潛在的力量並不是隨時都能够因為外力而發動起來的，牠有自己一定的法則，祇有誰知道了這個法則，依着這個法則，才能撥動這一民族的內部力量。一個民族——假使不是全體，至少是最前進的一部——自己理解了這個法則，便是表示這個民族的覺醒精神的存在·如果一個民族，始終不能有這樣一個覺醒的民族精神，那就是等於永遠判定牠的命運。</p>
<p>中國歷史是落後的，但這並不是唯一的證據可以用來證明中國民族精神和一般的知識，便必須同樣的落後·十九世紀的德國，在歐洲算是落後的國家，但是正因其落後，這個民族在精神上才積極地興奮，「十五世紀以後一切西歐的知識工作，緊緊地凝聚於德意志領域的幾十年之內，似乎他要竭盡每一個盎司的力量，以補救好幾世紀的失敗」·因此，十九世紀德一國民族精神，有了豐富的源泉，終為牠所以强一大的重大前提之一·同樣，廿世紀的俄羅斯亦是歐洲最落後的國家，但是牠能自覺地為自己精神發展努力，在俄國弟一决革命前，俄國自已就有了近百年文化發展，克服自己的落後和野蠻的遺跡，這對於牠造成一九一七年歷史偉大事件所需之經騐的前提和對於牠自己之理解，是有很大的關係。所以，重覆說一句，我們由此可知，歷史的落後，並不能證明該民族精神必須亦跟着落後。反之這正是給與我們精神有活動餘地的地方，如果我們知道努力和曾經努力，我們民族精神便能有新的開展，而且能加速度地進行；吾則，我們便有相反的結果·這裏正是决定於我們主觀的努力和覺悟。所以，在一定限度之下，一民族精神能够發展，便是該民族本身能够發展的火車頭。</p>
<p>中國是落後的，但是我們民族精神為什麼如此不長進，這正是民族自己的羞恥和悲哀，不能歸咎於歷史，最悲哀不過的，便是一味人認民族一般精神為不重要，以為母需民族精神的發展，便可以有民族的發展。這些人自認為「前進份子」，他們認為民族力量的集聚，可以像幽靈一樣能够隨時呼喊出來的。他們不理解民族精神的發展對於民族本身的發展的重大關係，他們甚至不要理解民族精神的落後和現狀是怎樣，其實他們是簡單的無知。</p>
<p>不知道民挨精神發展的重要性，就不知道為了解放全部的民族的鬥爭，便必須首先為解除民族精神自由發展的一切東縛而爭鬥之重要性。實際上，這樣就是放棄現實的自身的歷史重大任務。</p>
<p>現在只為大家一說解除民族自由發展的一切束縛之重要和迫切。</p>
<p>像我們上面所說，民族精神發展是民族本身發展的火車頭。但是，一國的民族精神之發展，都不是依着平順的道路走的。牠在當時常有舊有的歷史和社會藩籬，限制着他的發展。這一特別在落後國家，允其是如此。假使說二十一世紀俄羅斯的民族精神，有高峯的發達，那末一，他首先是會經過爭取民族精神之自由發展的機會。沒有自由發展的機會，民族精神是向窒滅一方面走，而不是走向發揚一方面走的。　中國現在的民族精神，有吾自由發揚的環境和可能，沒有。牠受思想的×和社會的歷史傳說的桎梏。牠是有和其他民族在自己歷史的發展上所遇的同樣的困難。因為所謂近代民族的創造和發展，是從否定自己過去的「中世紀」而出來的。各個民族的「中世紀」是該民族處在冬眠狀態的時代，可以說，那個時代並未創造起本表意義之「民族」和「民族的精神」。「中世紀」的表微（在和近代比較上說），便是沉死而不是活動，是停止而不是發展。所以近代一民族中普遍的「活動」和一發展」，是該民族全部的出發點·換言之，欲求一民族創立和發展，必須摧毀「中世紀的」和類似於「中世紀」的表徵之事物一。但是這是一個掙扎的過程，須依靠民族中的覺醒份子，號召全民族向這一方面走，而排擊民族中相反的一方面。因為牠知道這是創造「民族精神」的條件——即「民族自己集聚」和「民族自已理解」的條件。所以，一個民族是吾在現在還處在無知的情形之下，是吾還是不知努力於自己精神的發展，那實在還因為他在自己歷史發展中還沒有替自己發展和自己精神發展掃淸歷史道路。一個民族欲求自己的發展和自己精神的發展，必須首先努力排除障碍牠的各種條件，中國民族在牠走入近代的入口時，曾做過排除這類「中世紀」的掙扎工作，但是牠沒有把牠一大完成·因此，述到現在，「中世紀」成為一切事物，——或一切桎梏，正發之地壓在全民族的頭上，不論是「復古反動」，不論是言論出版的不自由，不論是思想一尊，……都是同一的成果，但是所有這些，很明顯地都是民族精神由麻木而停止的最方便方法。民族精神已入於衰微狀態，更談不上「輝解自己」了。這才是眞芷的悲哀。試問長在此狀態之下，中一國的民族，對於外患的到來，還能夥發生何種一嚴重的反應和尋覓何種應付的方法嗎？</p>
<p>我們現在應常覺悟：我們首先需要一個民族自由發展，自由伸張之社會和思想的條件。凡是在任何的環境上，在任何的思想上，包存有這種妨礙民族精神自由發展和伸張之本質的，都是應在排除之列，換言之，包含有過去「中世紀」傳說之本質的，都是應在排除之列。因為牠是違反民族發展的利益，而且簡單是民族利益之最不可饒恕的罪人。掃淸民族精神自由發展之障碍的歷史任務，是和要求民族對外獨立相一致。內部的民族解放和對外的民族解放，是一物之兩面。我們說：阻碍民族精神自由發展之社會的和思想的條件，就是中國的民族精神死滅的條件，亦就是中國的民族死滅的條件。爭取民族精神之自由的和民主主義的發展，是挽救民族的「國難」之堅定前提。</p>
<p>現在嚴重而殘破的局面，已是最後的一個試一金石·一切有思想而沒有「心死」的人，請考慮一一下眞正「民族的悲哀」，和自己的責任吧。</p>

<p>本局刋行的國學名著中，有定盫全集一種。定魚為淸代大作家，才氣磅礴，其文博奧精深，而富於現代性，其詩詞更艷麗飄逸，另具神韻，傳誦已久，為中國文學中不可多得之傑作。本局爰商請王文濡先生用科舉方法，詳細整理校訂，使臻完善，以利學子。自出版以來，頗蒙社會人士讚許。最近我們看到兩篇評論本書的文字，一是大公報一〇二期圖書副刊上張公量先生的評論，另一篇載在申報出版界（三十一期）上，是宏叔先生作的。兩位先生對於編校老王文濡先生，都發生懷疑與誤會，因此本局不得不有所聲明。</p>
<p>所謂皞皞子就是王文濡先生舊日的筆名，王文濡就是皞皞子的眞實姓名，其友好皆知之，此點木可不必由木局來代答。但王先生年近古稀，已於今秋去世了。國學扶輪社印行本，即由王先生手訂，刊於宣統元年，絕版已久。二十二年冬，王文濡先生將重訂舊木增加補充，定為足本，交本局出版。本局因印刷忙碌，致該稿積壓兩年之久，始於今夏刊行，這是本集產生的經過。淸楚了這點，常明白王文濡先生决不一沒人之功，掠為已有」了。本局以十餘年來服務文化界的信譽，斷不致欺哄讀者。</p>
<p>對於宏叔先生給本集補注以熱心的批評，這是我們很歡迎而感謝的。但有一點，即知歸子讚的補注，我們認為也沒有錯誤。因查定盫年譜三十二歲前後，會試屢禾第，三十三歲時，時……先生學佛，鐵君為第一導師，與仁和錢東父居十慈風和尙四人，皆奉徹悟禪師之書。……徧識西藏，西洋，蒙古，回部，及滿漢字，校定全藏，凡經有新舊敎譯老，皆訪得之。……自譯典入震旦以來，未之有也。又借經於龍泉寺僧唯一持陀羅尼滿四十九萬卷，更日定課程，誦普賢普鬥普眼之文·據此，定盫在中年，即已酷愛佛學，補注謂其「不得意而逃於禪」，並無不合事實之處。……其實定盫全集，自有其本身的價値，對於內容的再佔價，我們認為這是較評論補注史重要的。但不論怎樣，本集始終還是坊間定盫文集最完全的本子，這是張公量先生所推許的。至於尙有未錄定盫遺文，如宏叔先生藏有該種刻本，而蒙割愛，使成完璧以惠讀者，那是我們尤所感激的。</p>

<p>— 李衡之</p>
<p>生意經</p>
<p>有許多人（尤其是自己寫一些文字的所謂作家之流）以為祇嬰書的內容好，人家自然會來買，所以經營書店的主要問題，不在於銷路而在於出書。有的比較精明些，頂多也不過知道書出版了後，還需要廣吿的宜傳而已。就為了這種認識不足，有許多的書店閉門大吉，有許多作家因之和書店老闆吵架。</p>
<p>一切商品的决定條件在於市塲，書亦是一樣。國際資本主義的商品傾銷，必須中國的買辦，才能深入內地各處，决不能因其價廉物美，即可不脛而走。新書店所出版的新書，欲達到讀者之手，也眞是談何容易。除了一二大書店在各地有分行外，其他各書店的新書欲侵入各一地銷售，正和國際資本主義國家的商品需要買一辦一樣，非經過內地書賈的販賣不可。中國因一統一市塲機能的衰弱，各種行業仍有基爾特的一殘存，這種內地書賈，也是同樣的有帮口。中國舊式商賈的腐敗，是盡人皆知，這並不因為新書業是屬於文化事業範圍，而有所例外。</p>
<p>書賈亦可稱為內地的書店，他們的來源有兩種不同，」種是由前販賣石印「神童詩」「百家姓」等舊書的書賈蛻化，另一種則隨新書業的發展而發生，到現在，他們之間己沒有分別，其惟一營業便是把上海等埠各新書店的新書，販賣到他們的所在地去。他們的規模各有不同　，有的很大，如華北的佩文齋，豫郁文等，都還有他們自己的支店，佈置等嚴密的銷貨網，但大部都是規模小的。他們惟一營業方法，是與當地的學校聯絡，以推廣他們的賣買——自然，這也祇有少數，大多數亦僅是一個門市，做些廣吿，引誘讀者自動來購而已。但就是這樣對於新書業影饗已不少，如沒有他們，你的新書即無法到達他們那裏，你即少去了那裹的市塲。自然，這也是由於中國敎育水準一般低落使然，吾則需要書的讀者，大可以來函購，根本用不着他們的中介。但事實上，中國新書讀者，能隨時留意自已所需要的書籍出版情書外，一般書的銷行，都無非：「呀，有那樣一本書嗎，買一本吧」，書如不能放到讀者眼前，即不會有銷路。</p>
<p>就好了這樣，上海新書店的經理及跑街們，即非拉攏那些內地的書賈不可。但是那些內地的書賈，他們之經營書業，與經營洋布雜貨並沒有分別，不過把書也當作商品之一來販賣，對於文化，學術，甚至書的內容，並沒有一些意見——根本莫名其妙。他們所最重視的是：一，這書有沒有銷路？二，這書的定價與折扣如何，是吾有利？三，這書是吾有政治上的問題，即，是否會因販賣這書而被公安局封門？（過去，這種事情太多了）。他們的利潤，全在書的多量售出，這樣，必然使他們傾向於幾家大書店，因此，他們的營業主因，都是依賴幾家大書店的書為基礎，對於新開的小書店，因不知道那種書是吾穩健，可以數量不多，根本無甚出入，故多不願代為經售，以之，常有這樣的趣事；</p>
<p>「不要，這種書沒有銷路的，往來記帳多麻煩」！內地書賈對新開的書店的經理說，雖則那些書是最有價値，亦最有銷路的。</p>
<p>「朋友帮帮忙，就求你帶去試試看，送給你也可，銷不去可不必寄回」精明的經理這樣的哀懇。待書賈把書帶到內地，一售而空，讀者又紛紛往購的時候，利之所在，書賈自必不得不問那新書店要求添配，那時新書店經理現的計劃即成功了，不是藉此問書賈索欵，即甚至欵不來，書亦不發。</p>
<p>小的新書店，如發展其推銷網，固不得不拉攏內地書賈，而內地書賈因商品根本來源所在，却又去奉承那些大的新書店。他們的方法最重要的是訂特的。所謂特的，即某一區域範圍內的營業獨佔。各處我們所見到的，除「某某書局某地特的經售處」以外，還有什麼「某某書店某地分店」，這種所謂支店分店，大都均是與本店不相干的，不過特的經售而已。新書店利用特的經售的關係，可以接受若干保證金，又可規定特的經售處，每年至少作若干的營業。如那書店出的書確實好銷，那末，經售對於該店自必惟命是聽，否則，如新書一經停發，祇有閉門大吉。以故，新書店中規模愈大，收賬亦較易。有人說，在新書店大多喫倒帳，或收不到帳的今日，商務經售處的帳是不會收不到的，即由於此。</p>
<p>爲要推廣銷售綱，對內地書賈小書店爽力拉攏，即大書店亦多加靑昧。內地書賈，或是老板，或是經理，大多每節或每年來上海一次，以便就近結帳及配貨。中國新書業同業公會的組織，固不見得有多少重要的作用，而上海四馬路上却有一種自然的團結。每逢有內地的書賈到了上海，各書店的經理跑街等，彼此間有些感情的，即輾轉相吿，好像是來了個活財神似的，請客，拉攏，各盡其能。如那書賈，帶了一些現金來付帳或辦貨，則共旅館中一更是門庭如市，同業之間，往往還會因此發生齬齟。那家的帳付了，那家的貸配了少，大家會角逐起來。</p>
<p>中國舊式的商業往來，建築在所謂「交情」之上·「我和你有交情，你得多付我一些欵，多添我一些貸」·製造「交情」的方法，是花酒，鴉片·麻雀，看戲等等，以前如此，現在也還多是如此·我們雖不敢說新書業的賣買全是這樣的，但誰也不能否認這一套還是有·因此·時常有來上海辦結帳的書商，結果是滿身梅毒，歸不得也哥哥·這當然大部要歸咎於自己的意志不强，而亦不能說與那種不正當的應酬無關·有人說，中國商業的衰敗，由於交易制度的不良，我們如借用這話於新書業上，則新書業做「生意經」的方法，委實需要加以改良。（未完）</p>

<p>洪江桐油自白桐油大漲後，成本加高，不　倍蓰，今庚新油迄今未到，聞產地各榨坊計算每桶成本即以副牌而論，亦在三十元以上，但國產國銷之物品，其用度不及出口貿易之一二，且農村破產以後，農民購買力薄弱，若價格過高，有礙銷路，即以副洪第桶三十元而論，在內銷巿塲上已屬僅見，然在成本方面尚屬不敷，故將來新油銷塲，必更較往年减色，已可斷言，現在本埠所有陳油，均將銷罄，十家中僅一二家稍有存積，正洪濟昌和每桶已售至三十七元六角，副洪楊恒源早已告罄，慶元豐售至三十元以上，遇有購辦者，均須三十一元矣，實自有巿塲以來最高之價格，</p>

<p>輸出物價指數　總指數為八九·六，較上月之八〇·六漲百分之一一·二，較去年同月之七二，〇漲百分之二四·四，此項指數近年極度低落·本月指數係二十一年九月以來之最高指數，全表中物品漲者五五項，跌者五項，平者六項，三類指數與上月比較一致猛漲，原料品漲百分之一二·九，各品大都騰踊，尤以乾　·菜子·紅梁·廠吐·黃豆·芝蔴·統煤為甚，計漲百分之二〇至百分之五六不等，生產品漲百分之一〇·四，除白桐油以新貨上巿，開價猝跌百分之二五外，多數貨品皆漲，而以各種絲經·生油·豆油為尤著，消費品漲百分之七·六，其中　綢·縐·蛋黃·鷄蛋·綠茶·粗布·柴·炭價格一致激漲，</p>
<p>輸入物價指數　總指數為十四一·　較上月之一二三·七漲百分之一五·四，較去年同月之一三四·八漲百分之五·九，自二十年十一月以來，以本月指數為最高紀錄，全表中物品漲者六九項，跌者一項，平者一二項，三類指數與上月比較一致猛漲，原料品漲百分之二一·一，其中猛漲者如紫銅錠·花旗松·大條鉛·美棉·點銅錫各漲百分之二〇至百分之四三，消費品漲百分之一四·一，如煤油·赤白糖·花旗橘·白塔油·黑胡椒各漲百分之二〇至百分之二七不等，生產品漲百分之一一·九，各品巿價如白木紗漲百分之三二，有光紙·道林紙漲百分之三〇，牛皮紙漲百分之二九，人造絲·黑鐵管·柴油漲百分之二三，馬逹油漲百分之二二，三角鐵漲百分之二一，多數物品漲率自百分之一〇至百分之二〇，</p>
<p>生活費指數　總指數為一〇九·二，較上月之一〇三·九，漲百分之五·一，較去年同月之一〇八·八漲百分之〇·四，全表中物品漲者三〇項，跌者三項，平者一〇項，所由上漲之原因，一方面受　售物價之影響，別一方面則銅元兌價暴縮所致，按上月一日及十五日平均兌價為三四二枚，本月平均縮至三一八枚，即零售物價之以銅元為買賣單位者，折為國幣，無形中提高百分之七左右，五類指數除房租外，與上月比較一致上漲，燃料類漲百分之一〇·五，由於煤油·木柴·火柴上漲所致，衣着類漲百分之六·七，各種棉布俱見上漲，雜類漲百分之五·一，其中如香烟·肥皂，牙粉等，巿塲上皆以銅元論價也，食物類漲百分之四·六，豆油·黃豆·麵粉·白糖雖劇漲，但菠菜·青菜·蘿蔔皆以季節關係，產量正旺血猝跌，故本類指數之漲勢較為和緩，（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c194">我國對外方針 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>新外長張羣氏於十八日對新聞記老發表對外方針，謂中國外交政策，在以誠信謀國際間關係之調整，由合法途徑解除不平等義務云云。這是我國政府的對外方針　日本政府聞之，自應認爲十分滿意的，我國决無[排外]嫌疑</p>
<p>[九一八]以後，日本常責我國政府對它所提出的[親善]·[提携]等政策，沒有全部接受的[誠意」，這是日本政府在責備我們在國際關係上欠缺一誠信。但以我們國民至愚之思想，總也想得出，所謂誠信也者，第一是應該以　方互惠平等為基礎的。日本一方而以武力佔　了我國極大的十地，還要繼續向巾國內部進攻，一方面却責備我國在國際關係上欠缺誠信，　誠信實在無從知道可從何處確立？除非以中國完全變成印度或朝鮮，在中國民衆尙未被日本飛機炸彈完全炸光以前，這在一方面命令下的國際誠信，我們實在無從發現何處是它可以確立的地方。</p>
<p>孫中山先生在三民主義中，曾以極鄭重的意義說明，中國求獨立解放的途徑第一要廢除外國所加於我們身上的種種不平等條。這些不平等條的？「是中國全體國民的賣身文契]！這是中山先生曾經說過的最精彩的語句。在中山先生逝世的一刹那，在他最後最重要的遺言—今日大家所恭毛的遺囑—中，又曾聞重的囑咐後人：[最近主張開國民會議。及廢除不平等條約，尤須於最短期間，促其實現」一列强所加於中”身上的種種不平等條的，是從何而來的呢？這是從大砲飛幾等等武力　造成的。辱承日本[善　的誥　我們：中國要實行廢除不平等條約，應在「確立自國體制，整備近代國家機構]以後（見十九日日聯電）。我們實在無從知道，中國有三百八十餘萬平方華里的土地，在他入武力直接佔有之下，有一百二十餘萬平方華里的十地（冀察兩省），在他人武力的控制之下，有卽刻被直接佔據的可能，在這個狀態沒有改變以前，中國的「自國體制」，從何處可以確立？中國的近代國家機構，又從何處，可以整備？不平等條約，根本是不合法的東西，要和帝國主義以和平談判的方式，請它自動退出所估據我國的土地，這除非地球能翻一個身，根本有點兒渺茫。</p>
<p>實在，要確立中國自國體制，與整備近代國家機構，也不　。俗話有說：「以口還口，以牙還牙，」這正是中國要確立自國體制及整備　代國家機構的唯一道路了。</p>

<p>— 雯</p>
<p>阿虎有一對拳頭，鐵一樣的拳頭，靠着這對拳頭，他脚踏黃河兩岸，拳打南北東西，在這大街上獨霸一方了。</p>
<p>阿虎沒有家，白天在茶館里等太陽落，晚上窩在賭塲里。但是他不賭錢，賭塲老闆供給他飯食床舖，就為他有一對拳頭。阿虎坐鎭在賭塲里，那些賭客就不敢欠賬或是打架，這一點，阿虎洋洋自得地拍過胸脯：「囈老子的拳頭！」</p>
<p>阿虎在正經人眼里是個道地的流氓，走路搖呵擺的跌滿全街，一頂廉價的呢帽　在背　　上，他終年不穿長衣，短衣的紐扣仿佛助骨似的密密一排，腰間是一條　着雙龍搶珠的紡綢褲帶。面上橫肉突起，半截烟尾貼着嘴角，沒有見他人，就能聽見一連串的臊那娘。但是他踏上街來，他是老闆，他是老大，沒有人當面敢稱他阿虎。他身邊有一個摺簿，他用圓圈槓子記着各個償戶的名字及欵項，他從賭塲里出來，就靠着大街依攤收錢。譬如借一塊錢的，每天還大洋一角，十日為期：借十塊錢就每天要還一塊了。那些攤戶就終年還不清他的債，舊的未清，他可以再借錢給你還債，那摺簿上的圓圈槓子永遠沒有塗抹的一天。然而阿虎有一對鐵一樣的拳頭，拳頭造成了他的地位。</p>
<p>腰包里裝滿了大洋銀角，阿虎上茶館了。茶館老闆總是迎着笑臉招呼他：「生意好？」</p>
<p>阿虎搖搖頭，他不懂得生意。「老子有本錢放債，就不怕他們少了一個邊！」說着把兜肚里的錢摔了一桌子，他兩腿一橫，挺結實地把背樑撑着墻壁，照着摺簿上的記號計算起來。在畫着一個出鬚老頭的地方。阿虎掄着三角眼開腔了。</p>
<p>「老闆，錢老頭那鬼兒子住在那里？臊那娘！三天沒有到街上來做賣買了，哼，想賴債嗎？看老子的拳頭！」碰的一聲，把桌子搥得呌了起來。</p>
<p>茶館老闆對他笑着。阿虎這對橫行不法的拳頭，對錢老頭已失了效用了。老闆慢慢地踱過去，學着阿虎的勁兒，在他肩頭上拍了一下：</p>
<p>「老大，找錢老頭嗎？看你著了鐵草鞋去討這筆陰債罷！」</p>
<p>「什麽？」老大呌了起來：「這老頭三天就死去了嗎？」</p>
<p>阿虎翻開摺簿，嘴角里罵着臊那娘把那些橫點豎的記那計算着：「哼，要二十五塊呢！這三天沒有付利息，加三塊三角二分。老闆，他家里還有什麽人，賴老子的債，看拳頭！」又是碰的一下。</p>
<p>「還有一個十六歲的女兒，」一個賭塲里的賭客搶着說了：「二十八塊錢買一個老婆，還不合算嗎？」</p>
<p>阿虎笑了。他這多年來祇在洋鈿上打斛斗，他沒有想到過弄女人。這是機會，弄個老婆來玩玩，阿虎想着，提了兜肚衝下茶樓。</p>
<p>這天晚上阿虎沒有回賭塲。賭客們談論着，說他找錢老頭的女兒去了。一個賭客更取笑說：</p>
<p>「有人要借錢嗎？找小錢姑娘去，就不怕他的拳頭。」</p>
<p>阿虎第二天沒有上街。好事的人尋到錢老頭的家里，錢老頭家門敝着，沒有一個人。阿虎倒臥在小錢姑娘的床里，床上淌着血水，阿虎一對鐵一樣的拳頭斫了，翻着白眼，斷氣了。</p>
<p>地保偷偷地報告警察局，募了一口松木棺材埋葬了，沒有人敢起這件事。</p>

<p>「凱歌」中甜蜜畫面</p>
<p>菱塘內，微風吹拂裏，水波輕動中日袁美雲和他的弟弟劉犂正駕着一葉扁舟在那裏採摘菱角。碧綠的天空中，從遠處傳來着一陣陳的農婦們的歌聲，美雲終亦情不自禁地輕　船舷唱了起來。其歌詞曰：</p>
<p>六月江南天氣晴，</p>
<p>姐在池中採紅菱，</p>
<p>菱角尖尖刺痛手，</p>
<p>赤日炎炎晒煞人。</p>
<p>天哪！天，</p>

<h3 id="e18">New Stimulus to the Financial Market <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— End</p>
<p>Since the price of silver plummeted overseas, the Shanghai financial market has been deeply stimulated. The price of gold, which had been stable between 1,140 and 1,150 yuan since the currency reform, has lost its normal track and has risen sharply again and again, once reaching 1,200 yuan. It is said that the decline in the price of silver has not started today, but there has been no such change in the price of gold. At this moment, it is fueling the flames, so what else is at play? As a result, the talk of lengthening customs gold and shrinking foreign exchange has spread in the market again. However, looking at the situation in the foreign exchange market, it can be maintained in the near future, but there is no shortage of tight conditions in the long term. In addition, it is difficult to cope with the jealousy of Japanese banks, and fortunately, the assistance of British banks has alleviated the urgency in the long term. However, it has not been two months since the implementation, and the pricing has changed. How can this not open people's fears? Moreover, everyone knows that there are many obstacles and difficulties in China's currency reform. How can there be reason to implement it rashly without thorough calculations and careful consideration in advance? Since it has been implemented, there must be prepared forces and coping strategies to overcome all difficulties.</p>
<p>Lothian said that he would not participate in China's currency reform, and China happened to implement the reform at that time, and Hong Kong followed suit and changed. This is certainly something that the British financial community is satisfied with. Now that Hong Kong's difficulties have been resolved and China is still struggling, the change in the price of silver has occurred at this time. Will the US silver policy change, or is it deliberately applying pressure? This is beyond our knowledge, but if the United States really has the ability to control international currency and make it stable, it is also what we hope for.</p>
<p>What is the impact of the US silver policy on international currency? Since Mexico was forced to use paper money due to the US silver purchase, most people felt inconvenienced. Recently, there have also been those who advocated that the ban on the use of silver coins should be lifted. If Mexico abolishes the ban on the use of silver coins, the Mexican currency exchange market will definitely be strengthened, and the silver coins will be allowed to circulate again. As for China, the United States originally hoped to promote the purchasing power of silver-using countries, but the result was the opposite. Although the import of American goods into China still ranks first, its volume in the third quarter has fallen from 26% last year to 19%. Japan's has increased from 11% to 14%.</p>
<p>If you want to revive the economy, you must first seek currency stability. It is not that there is no such idea in the international community, but it is difficult to implement. This is because each has its own selfish opinions. If selfish opinions are not eliminated for a day, the currency war will not stop for a day. China, in the vortex of triangular competition, will also deeply suffer from its pain. However, what is the way out? It still lies in us choosing from the standpoint of our national economy.</p>

Without the Wuchang Uprising, the Republic of China would not have been born. Without the Yunnan Uprising, the Republic of China, even if established, would have been interrupted. Without the Northern Expedition, the Republic of China, even if revived, would have been squandered by the warlords. Viewed from a historical perspective, it is truly the most valuable page. Currently, the national crisis is grave, and the nation's future is extremely perilous. If the entire nation, from top to bottom, can promote the spirit of the martyrs, then the difficult pass will surely be overcome. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>

Judges are unaware of the suffering of those detained, so criminal court staff and prosecutors should be ordered to take turns visiting detention centers every Sunday to inspect conditions inside. Judges handling cases should each establish a memorandum book, detailing the names of detainees and the reasons for their detention, to facilitate review. As for the court clerks responsible for submitting appeals, they must ensure that the first and second instance case files, judgments, and related documents are complete. Those who are late in submitting them will be urged to submit them within the deadline, and those who violate this will be severely punished. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>Nanjing. The Ministry of Railways issued instructions to various railway bureaus, stating: "As per the Ministry of Finance's advisory, cash coins are no longer current currency. Previously, during the European War, the price of copper rose sharply. To prevent Chinese and foreign merchants from taking the opportunity to transport and profit from them, a ban was issued on merchants and citizens carrying more than ten thousand cash coins, with all seized coins to be confiscated. The railway authorities also established regulations stating that those transporting more than fifty thousand cash coins must possess a passport; those without a passport would have their coins confiscated. Now that circumstances have changed, the Ministry of Finance has canceled the ban on cash coins. The revised regulations for transporting copper coins, as revised by the Ministry of Railways, are as follows: 1. Merchants carrying between two thousand and twenty thousand copper coins or more than five thousand cash coins per person per shipment must pay freight according to regulations. Anyone found concealing or smuggling coins shall be charged freight according to Article 57 of the General Rules for Cargo Transportation, and shall be fined ten times the amount of freight collected. If no one claims the coins, they shall be confiscated. 2. Merchants carrying more than ten thousand single copper coins per person per shipment traveling within the province must hold a passport issued by the provincial, municipal, or county government. Those traveling to other provinces must hold a passport issued by the Ministry of Finance. All passports must be presented to the station for verification at the time of shipment before payment and transport are permitted. If unauthorized smuggling of copper coins is discovered, all coins shall be seized and reported to the bureau. In addition to paying the freight and a fine to make up for the deficiency, the remaining coins shall be confiscated. If no one claims the coins, they shall be confiscated."

<p>London. The Abyssinian Legation recently published a letter to the British people during the Christmas season, stating: "Just men of the Great British Empire, Muslims around the world, will you also listen to our weak cry? As the world celebrates Christmas with joy and revelry, the people of Abyssinia are on the front lines engaged in a war without just cause, either wielding knives to kill or being killed. Innocent Abyssinians and innocent Italians are shedding blood on the battlefield in a brutal massacre. We can only appeal to Heaven and to the people of the world to stop this human slaughter. Any nation, no matter how powerful or arrogant, if the world uses its strength to stop its acts of looting and massacre, we believe it will surely succeed. Are you afraid of this one country? Or have diplomatic reasons and selfish notions rendered you silent? For the sake of your honor and reputation, you should not be manipulated by a dictator without being able to help yourselves. Know that the people of Abyssinia, to protect their independent sovereignty which has surrounded their country for hundreds of years, will not fear continuing to fight. But how can the world stand by and watch as an invading country uses its sophisticated weapons to try to massacre and loot a weak country without any defensive equipment? This is what we cannot understand. We now respectfully wish our Christian and Muslim compatriots a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year, but at the same time, we must tell you that your Abyssinian co-religionists are at this time on the battlefield sacrificing their lives for their beloved country, their emperor, and their sacred independent sovereignty, and their number is in the thousands. We hope that in your rejoicing, you will not forget these unfortunate and pitiful comrades and that you will pray to Heaven for these oppressed people. If everyone can treat others as they wish to be treated, then the ideal of peace and happiness can be realized, and the world will surely become a paradise for mankind."

<p>Vatican City, Rome.

But recent events are such that we cannot utter auspicious words. We traverse the path of darkness shrouded in gloom to reach Christmas. The Russian atheistic movement, which is gradually spreading throughout the world, and the oppression of Catholics in Mexico, are all shadows we encounter. In addition, there are those who oppose true Christianity in the name of false Christianity (this probably refers to Germany). But the forces of darkness cannot ultimately obscure the light, so we continue to hope, for hope is a necessity and also our responsibility."

The magazine also said that even if the United States builds warships to the strength permitted by the treaty and must rely entirely on the base at Pearl Harbor, it will be insufficient to protect American commerce, its people, and its interests in Asia.

<p>Tokyo. The distribution plan for the Japanese military's next year's budget has been completed. At the reception for representatives of various factions of the House of Representatives, Osumi will explain it in detail. The important focus is on responding to the Red Army in the Far East and controlling China's land and air. The total budget amounts to over 551,185,600 yen, of which over 236,886,600 yen is for regular expenses and over 314,497,000 yen is for temporary expenses. There is an increase of over 22 million yen in the total budget amount. Regarding the most important strengthening of air power, an additional budget for aviation equipment, amounting to over 8.4 million yen, has been added to the temporary expenses. By the time the Soviet Union completes its Second Five-Year Plan in 1937, preparations must be made for 39 aviation squadrons. The regular expenses include the maintenance costs of all existing aircraft, pilots, cartography, etc., totaling over 24 million yen. Adding the fixed expenditure of 88 million yen for naval aviation, the total amounts to over 110 million yen.</p>
<p>In addition, the conversion of aircraft carriers and heavy cruisers is also a clear indication of the Japanese Navy's special attention to strengthening air power. (Hualian News Agency dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Japanese Government Countermeasures to Parliament: Watching Opposition Party Trends; Talk of Dissolving the Diet Gaining Traction <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Yesterday, Prime Minister Okada and cabinet members with seats in both houses convened to discuss countermeasures for the Diet. Minister of Commerce Machida initially advocated for dissolution. However, most cabinet members, seeing dissolution as unavoidable, proposed temporarily observing the internal situation of the Seiyukai party before making a final decision. Within the Seiyukai, the hardliners, centered around President Suzuki, advocated for submitting a comprehensive vote of no confidence. Conversely, the Kokutai Meicho-ha faction, led by Kuhara, plotted to avoid dissolution by submitting individual votes of no confidence. The centrist Nichisei faction, anticipating inevitable dissolution, argued that such a resolution would lead to unavoidable conflict between the Diet and the government. However, the general sentiment within the party was relatively strong. Recently, the Tohoku Diet members group, led by Tokutake, which hoped to establish a Tohoku revitalization budget, and a faction that disapproved of using the Meicho issue for political strife, took action to shift towards a dissolution-supporting movement. President Suzuki's health also subtly influenced the dissolution-leaning argument within the Seiyukai, making the party's direction uncertain. Meanwhile, the Minseito party aimed to solidify its party position by aligning with the Seiyukai's Chen Rong. The party decided that the local elections should be a purge and an election to realize government policies, thus coordinating with the government on the same front, ensuring a majority of pro-government personnel. The military naturally hoped for dissolution. While dissolution would inevitably delay the budget's approval, it would certainly be established in a special session. Therefore, numerous issues related to the military remained unresolved, such as the military control problem, budget formulation disputes, the Kokutai Meicho issue, and informal statements regarding understanding the international situation. Thus, there seemed to be an intention to avoid escalating conflict with the government through Diet dissolution. Consequently, considering the circumstances from all sides, the atmosphere strongly favored dissolution. (25th Electric Communications Society dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The House of Representatives decided on the standing committee chairs for the budget, settlement of accounts, petitions, proposals, and disciplinary matters on the 27th. In the previous session, due to cooperation between the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, the two parties each held half the positions. However, the cooperation was canceled in May, intensifying the confrontation between the two parties. Therefore, the Seiyukai, wielding its absolute majority, monopolized all the committee chairs.

<p>Tokyo: The temporarily deteriorated Japan-Canada trade relations have had a supportive opportunity since the establishment of Mr. Kanaya's Liberal Party cabinet.

From New Year's Day next year, the two governments will abolish retaliatory tariffs and restore the situation before the invocation of the Trade Protection Act in late July. This decision will not take the form of a Japan-Canada trade agreement but will be achieved by Canada amending its domestic laws, aiming to ease inappropriate measures against Japan by January 1st next year. Simultaneously, Japan has also decided to cancel the invocation of the Trade Protection Act. All procedures for abolishing the Imperial Ordinance regarding the Trade Protection Act will be completed at the Tariff Investigation Council on the 26th and seconded at the cabinet meeting on the 27th, which will then be notified to Canada.

<p>New York: The Lindbergh couple's move to England has been criticized by newspapers across the United States, considering it a disgrace to the United States. The New York Communications Newspaper stated that although there have been cases of great men leaving their countries in the past, no country has ever forced its most famous figure to move abroad out of fear for their life due to inadequate protection. The New York Times stated that "We must resolutely eliminate the thugs in the country and allow Lindbergh and the children of ordinary citizens to live safely in the country."

One hundred and twenty-two kidnappers have been convicted, four of whom have received the death penalty and the rest sentenced to imprisonment.

The Kansas City Star stated, "Lindbergh is virtually being exiled from America, a national disgrace." The New York Daily News, while acknowledging Lindbergh's move as an escape from thugs, stated, "However, his own efforts to avoid official reports are sufficient to generate publicity, similar to the movie star Garbo."

<p>London: Reuters has learned that the National City Bank of New York and the Chase National Bank have agreed to buy silver futures expiring in March in China and Bombay on behalf of the US government in order to maintain market conditions and prevent the serious impact of the silver price decline. According to reliable sources, the two banks have purchased 50 million ounces of silver from the Chinese government. After the news that foreign exchange was used to maintain the Chinese currency Mt. Aori silver market improved, sentiment became more optimistic. It is reported that speculators from China and India have slightly purchased. Some parties here believe that the recent manipulation of the silver market by the United States aims to control the power of the silver market in New York's hands. (25th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Today, the Treasury Department announced that the government has purchased 761,774,000 ounces of silver as of December 6th, costing US$438,698,442, an average of 57 cents per ounce. The silver will be booked at $1.29 per ounce, so even though the current silver price has fallen, the government still has a surplus of $543,990,018 on its books. Currently, only 362,000,000 ounces have been booked as actual surplus, and the rest are calculated as silver ingots in inventory. However, once the banknotes are printed, they will also be used as reserves for the banknotes at a price of $1.29. The current number in the Treasury Department's inventory is 1,473,774,000 ounces, far from the target of 2,600,000,000 ounces. Therefore, some parties have begun to advocate for Congress to acknowledge that it is impossible to reach this target and change the law. (24th National Electric dispatch)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: At around 8 am on the 18th of this month, Wu Dequn, the leader of the third squadron of the Guangdong Air Force, led pilots Deng Xiexun, Cai Bingqiu, and Chen Jingting, etc., to conduct aerial combat drills as usual. Wu and Deng were riding "Foker" style fighter jets, while Cai and Chen were riding "Curtiss" style fighter jets. When the two planes rose to an altitude of 6,000 feet, Wu and Deng's fighter jet began to practice various attack techniques. After circling in the sky for a while, Cai and Chen's fighter jet, upon seeing this, recognized the Foker jet as a simulated enemy and accelerated to pursue. The "Foker" jet immediately evaded. At 9:30 am, the "Foker" jet turned back to attack the "Curtiss" jet and intended to repel the enemy, with a faster speed than before. The "Foker" jet also rushed forward like lightning. Due to carelessness at one moment, the planes collided with each other at an altitude of over 3,000 feet. Thick smoke erupted, and the fuel tanks of the two planes exploded in the air. The four pilots in the planes were unable to escape and were killed. In an instant, the two planes fell to an open area near the No. 3 Middle School playground on Dongsha Road, outside the eastern suburbs. When they landed, the two planes were still burning. Upon hearing the news, the Air Force Headquarters immediately telegraphed the fire department to send fire trucks to put out the fire. On one side, the department sent an ambulance and four paramedics to the scene to provide rescue. They saw that Squadron Leader Wu Dequn's limbs were incomplete, and one leg was blown hundreds of feet away. Deng Xiexun's entire body was charred. Cai and Chen were also in the plane, their heads were burned, their faces were blurry, and they could not be identified. Their abdomens and intestines flowed out. Their deaths were tragic. The personnel of the funeral company were hired to go to the scene to put the four in coffins. It is reported that Wu was from Dongjiang, and Deng, Cai, and Chen were all from Taishan County. The Air Force Department considers the four young men died in the line of duty and is deeply saddened. It has requested the Headquarters to provide generous compensation to the families. A public memorial service is scheduled for the 21st, and they will be buried in the Air Force Cemetery in Yunhe Ridge. It is found that the two new planes were recently purchased from foreign countries and are new-style fighter jets, worth more than 200,000 yuan in total. (December 19th)</p>

<p>——Students Request Huang Huabiao to Maintain School Affairs</p>
<p>Hangzhou News: Zhejiang University President Guo Renyuan tried to stop students from petitioning in Beijing and also had staff members of the school's military training office guide plainclothes detectives to arrest student representatives in the middle of the night. This caused student dissatisfaction, and Guo resigned to the Ministry of Education. All school affairs are temporarily managed by Li Deyi, the dean of the College of Agriculture. The school has three colleges of engineering, agriculture, arts, and sciences. Zhu Yicheng, the dean of the College of Engineering, went to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital for treatment due to illness, and has not returned to school for two months. The dean of the College of Arts and Sciences is concurrently held by Guo himself. The Secretary-General has resigned and gone to Beijing, and the position is still vacant. Li Deyi, the dean of the College of Agriculture, is also unable to maintain school affairs due to student opposition. The student council decided to request the professors to teach as usual, and sent representatives to Beijing to ask the Ministry of Education to quickly appoint a suitable successor. They will return to Hangzhou to report the results. Yesterday (24th) at 8 pm, the students convened a general meeting again. It was stated that although the school has been teaching as usual these days, the school affairs lack someone to take responsibility, and the students still feel uneasy. After discussion, it was decided that Huang Huabiao, the current Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, was the former Secretary-General of Zhejiang University and has a harmonious relationship with the students. Before the new president takes office, it was decided to invite Huang to formally maintain school affairs. More than 50 professors from Zhejiang University held a meeting at the YMCA at 4 pm today to discuss ways to restore the school to its original normal track. Zhejiang University has caused disputes due to students' patriotic movements. The school authorities issued a written statement as follows: "On the 21st of this month, President Guo resigned to the Ministry of Education due to a dispute caused by trying to stop students from petitioning in Beijing, and requested Li Deyi, the dean of the College of Agriculture, to temporarily maintain school affairs. Unexpectedly, this notice was torn down by students immediately after it was posted. The students also controlled the telephone, checked official documents and telegrams, and cut off internal and external communication. On the same day, when the staff of the General Affairs Department left the office after completing their work, they were stripped and inspected one by one. The 22nd was Sunday, and the 23rd was the school's unified anniversary, and holidays were given as usual, but the students guarded the school gate, and faculty and staff and anyone else could not enter or leave without a pass issued by the students, and they also monitored Yan Jikuan, the director of the Gao Gong Yong Yu, and staff members Guo Jian and Lan Zhenliang. On the morning of the 24th, Dean Li of the College of Agriculture went to the College of Agriculture first due to important business. Unexpectedly, more than 40 students followed him shortly after he arrived at the college, immediately cut off communication, and rushed into the dean's office to search for Dean Li. At that time, some professors and school staff lost their freedom. The students rushed into the office of Director Yang of Gao Nong, ordered Director Yang Yinong to leave the school, and ordered him to confess the whereabouts of Dean Li. In this chaotic state, Dean Li felt that he could not carry out school affairs."</p>

<p>Mountain Residence on the East Bank of the Tong River, by Yang Yishui</p>
<p>1. The Mountain People on the East Bank of the Congshan Junling Tong River Still Linger in a Semi-Savage State</p>
<p>Speaking of the Tong River, everyone may be very unfamiliar, right? Well then, let's start from the Shanghai that everyone is familiar with and take the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway train to Hangzhou. Hangzhou is on the west bank of the Qiantang River. The Qiantang River tide in August, everyone may be very familiar with the name Qiantang River, right? Well then, how about we travel in this familiar Qiantang River now? Let's hire a small boat in Hangzhou first. Going upstream along the Qiantang River, it will only take half a day, and you can enjoy the landscape of the Fuchun River. If we move forward again, we can see that the green high mountains on both sides of the river are gradually approaching. In the middle of the high mountains on both sides, there seems to be a gap specially reserved for this river. This is the Tong River we are going to talk about.</p>
<p>There are six counties on both sides of the Tong River. The west bank is Fuyang, Xindeng, Tonglu, and Jiande, and the east bank is Zhuji and Pujiang. The counties of Tonglu and Jiande span the Tong River. What we are talking about now is the east bank of the Tong River, which is the junction of the three counties of Tong, Jian, and Pu.</p>
<p>Now let's disembark here and land.</p>
<p>Landing here, I am afraid you will feel very hard—there are no rickshaws after landing, nor are there sedan chairs or horses. We must walk the rest of the way ourselves. Because from here forward, all we see in front of us are mountains—the road we are taking is夹 between these thousands of mountains and valleys, or on the sheep intestine path winding around the Congshan Junling. You may be thinking, have we already arrived in Taoyuan? Yes—we are going to see a village every five or ten miles along the way. They are built at the foot of the mountain or on the mountainside. Cooking smoke often lingers on the rocks, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can sometimes be heard in our ears. Taoyuan is really a bit similar—however, if we take a closer look, we will break our impression of Taoyuan. Those are not tile houses inhabited by humans—those are animal dens made of茅草 and蓬蒿—this is not Taoyuan, but the world of mountain people lingering in a semi-savage state.</p>
<p>2. Every Inch of Land at the Feet of the Mountain People Belongs to the Mountain Owners</p>
<p>The mountain people do not eat rice, but mainly糊 made of苞萝 flour and soup made of沉淀 and soaked 蕨根. There is a great lack of mountain fields, and grain and rice naturally become very precious things. The seasonings are vegetables grown on the mountain land and wild vegetables that grow naturally on the mountain. The mountain is really convenient for them—of course they also raise pigs and chickens, but they do not eat the meat of these pigs and chickens themselves. What do they raise them for? They also rarely plant one or two acres of mountain fields, and of course grain comes out of the fields, but they do not eat it themselves either. What do they grow it for? They sometimes go to the mountains to plant or采发, and sometimes they also make tools in their own homes. They must have the skills of both farmers and craftsmen. But their planting,采发, and production are not free. Why is this? You must have questions.</p>
<p>Because when the mountain people open the door, all the green mountains they see are not their own—many, even the thatched cottage they live in is not their own—every plant and tree in the mountain, every tile on the roof (it is茅草—), every inch of soil under their feet belongs to the mountain owners dozens or hundreds of miles away—</p>
<p>3. The Mountain Owners, in Order to Make Every Drop Return to Their Own Warehouses, Are Powerful People Driving the Mountain People</p>
<p>Most of the mountain owners live in small, flat plains where the mountain ridges are not very crowded. Because it is a small plain, the roads are naturally flatter. The geographical situation makes this small plain a market for primitive exchange by mountain farmers. The mountain owners who live on this small plain are mostly shop owners in this market and landlords on the small plain. They are the masters of the verdant, rolling mountains in the distance, and also the masters of the fate of these mountain farmers.</p>
<p>The mountain owner's ownership of the mountain塲 is the same as the landlord's ownership of the land. The only difference is: "Rich families manage the fields, and powerful families manage the mountains." The mountain owner must add a little "豪" to "富". Because, in general, the distance from the mountain塲 to the owner's home is often farther than the distance from the land to the owner. In order to make every drop in the mountain return to the mountain owner's warehouse, it is naturally necessary to be more powerful than ordinary landlords. Moreover, because the mountain塲 cannot be as flat and unshielded as the land, and the boundaries are clear and not mixed, it is necessary to have a commanding arrogance in order to make the mountain farmers obey.</p>
<p>The high mountains cannot send the resources in the mountains to the mountain owner's door by themselves. The mountain owner must have mountain people to plant and采发 on the mountains, bring them home to manufacture, and transport them to the mountain owner's home. Therefore, in the first step, the mountain owner must first make a selection of the mountain塲: which place can be planted? Which place can be探发? In general, the soil that is thick and more can be planted with苞萝 and tung trees, called杉木山, and the soil that is thin and more stone can only be used for burning charcoal from firewood in the mountain, called柴　山. The mountain owner is based on this standard and then either leases it to the mountain people to plant or orders the mountain people to采发. Then, the natural wealth夹 with the sweat and blood of the mountain people is transported in baskets and baskets to their own warehouses.</p>
<p>What kind of纽带 is used to complete this process? Below we will explain this kind of纽带 between the mountain owner and the mountain people, and the process completed by this纽带.</p>
<p>A mountain owner has a mountain, just like a landlord has a square field, and the rent is collected in the same way. We have already said that there is no difference. However, there is one thing that is different between mountains and fields, that is, the crops on the mountains cannot be harvested every year like the fields. The harvest on the mountains decreases year by year. After six or seven years, this planted mountain must be abandoned to restore the fertility of the mountain塲. This is a bit like the three-field system in primitive society. The production technology is low, and they do not know how to fertilize. After a long time, it will naturally become barren. In the eyes of the mountain owner, the turnover of the mountain's capital and profit is slower than that of the field. Therefore, the mountain tenancy system also differs greatly from the field.

<h3 id="e101">Li Shi Ci, Seriously Wounded and Passed Away, Cause of Attack Definitely Not a Personal Vendetta, Hong Kong Authorities Offer Reward for Arrest of Culprit <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Li Gongyin, editor-in-chief of the Industrial and Commercial Daily, was suddenly attacked by assassins on Li Yuan East Street on the 16th of this month, suffering serious gunshot wounds. Police sent him to the National Hospital for treatment. After Mr. Li was admitted to the hospital, his condition fluctuated between improving and worsening. However, he ultimately succumbed to his injuries and passed away at 5:05 AM on the 20th. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Continuous Deterioration of Condition: After Mr. Li entered the hospital, his temperature and pulse rate had slightly decreased by the afternoon of the 16th. However, because both his small and large intestines had been penetrated by bullets, his condition remained extremely serious. By late evening on the 16th, he felt increasingly uncomfortable, and fecal matter was vomited from his mouth. He felt somewhat better after doctors performed a gastric lavage. On the 17th, Mr. Li's colleagues visited him in the hospital and found his spirit and complexion had improved. His voice was also quite strong as he thanked his colleagues for their concern. On the 18th, his condition was slightly more serious than before. From midnight, his pulse was 120 beats per minute and his temperature was 106 degrees Fahrenheit. He groaned incessantly, tossed and turned in bed, and frequently cried out in pain. He was able to fall asleep only after Dr. Tan performed a gastric lavage and administered an injection. At 3 PM, Mr. Li's younger brother and mother visited him. Mr. Li's expression had greatly improved, and he had a detailed conversation with his brother, encouraging him, and comforted his mother. At 4 PM, his pulse was 125 beats per minute and his temperature was 99.4 degrees Fahrenheit. However, he looked slightly fatigued. From 6 PM to 8 PM, his condition suddenly deteriorated. He vomited several times in those two hours, expelling clots and yellowish-white foul liquid, about three or four mouthfuls. He also felt short of breath, like he was about to vomit, and groaned in pain. At 7:30 PM, Dr. Tan performed another gastric lavage on Li. The reporter, with Dr. Tan's permission, accompanied the doctor on a visit. Although Mr. Li was groaning in pain, he was able to say, "I am very uncomfortable. If I vomit again, I will have no strength left." The reporter approached and offered comfort, and Mr. Li nodded in response. Then, he gestured for the reporter to leave. At 8:05 PM, after Dr. Tan and Mr. Li finished the gastric lavage, the reporter accompanied Li's brother for another visit. Upon seeing the reporter, Mr. Li immediately told his brother, "I will not die. You must work hard for your future, cherish your time, and be filial to our mother. There is no need to worry about me, I will not die." He also said that after the gastric lavage, his body felt more comfortable than before. The reporter later learned from the attending physician that Mr. Li's condition was still not out of danger. Based on the situation this evening (the 18th), his condition was more serious than the previous day. Although Mr. Li's temperature had not increased, there was no fear of inflammation. However, the doctor did not know the extent of internal organ damage based on the foul liquid that Mr. Li had vomited. In conclusion, the doctor could not say that Mr. Li's condition had improved. They still had to wait and see what happened in the next few days to determine his future. On the 19th, his condition worsened again. From 2 AM, he vomited until dawn, spitting out clotted blood, and was in extreme pain. According to the doctor, there was a fear that blood vessels were bleeding inside his abdomen, causing clotted blood to accumulate there. Therefore, another operation was necessary to remove the clotted blood in order to be effective. Re-operating would offer a glimmer of hope, while not operating would lead to despair. However, Mr. Li's family feared that his body could not withstand another operation. After the first operation, they felt that his expression had changed dramatically. If he underwent another operation, he would certainly not be able to endure it. Regarding the question of whether to operate again, the hospital doctors left the decision to his family. His family had no opinion and consulted a female doctor about everything, as she had assisted during the first operation to remove the bullets. In the end, no further surgery was performed. Mr. Li became more breathless that day. According to his family, since vomiting yesterday morning (the 18th), his throat felt strangely itchy and as hot as fire. At 2 AM on the 20th, Mr. Li felt even more pain, and his condition became even more dangerous. He lost his composure and his speech became incoherent. Despite the doctors' best efforts to save him, they were unable to turn the tide. At 5:05 AM, he unfortunately passed away. According to hospital sources, when doctors discovered that Mr. Li had lost consciousness at 2 AM on the 20th, they gave him a cardiac stimulant injection, and he soon fell asleep. However, at 4:50 AM, he struggled violently due to severe pain and was unable to speak. Approximately 20 minutes later, he passed away. During his final moments, he said to his brother that he had always treated people with sincerity and had no personal enemies. He said that judging from his injuries, he did not expect to live much longer and hoped that his colleagues in the newspaper would continue their efforts.</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangements: After Mr. Li passed away, the hospital immediately sent his remains to the mortuary. He was placed in a coffin at 2:30 PM and the funeral procession departed at 3 PM, led by the National Hospital. He was buried at the foot of the mountain in the Western Chicken Cage Ring of Pok Fu Lam Road. Many relatives and friends sent wreaths, and hundreds of people attended the funeral procession, including many colleagues from Hong Kong newspapers. They bid farewell to his spirit at the farewell pavilion. It was raining and snowing that day, and the scene was extremely tragic. The pallbearers, remembering Mr. Li's 20 years as a journalist and his tragic death, were all deeply saddened. Mr. Li left behind an elderly mother and a wife, as well as children. His mother was heartbroken by her beloved son's tragic death, and her cries nearly caused her to faint.</p>
<p>Impoverished After Death: Mr. Li was generous throughout his life. He always did his best to help relatives and friends who sought his assistance. He often gave away half of his monthly salary to relatives and friends, leaving him penniless and impoverished after his death. He left behind a 70-year-old mother, a widow, and orphans waiting to be fed. The future is long, and this is truly the greatest sorrow in the world. The Hong Kong and mainland newspapers, along with his relatives and friends, have issued funeral announcements, hoping that Mr. Li's relatives and friends will offer condolences, and that all funeral gifts will be converted into cash, so that the deceased can rest in peace and the living can receive practical benefits.</p>
<p>Cause of Attack: Mr. Li was known to be upright, honest, and extremely kind. All of his colleagues in Hong Kong newspapers knew this, and they all deeply believed that Mr. Li had no personal enemies. So why was he shot by assassins? According to general observation, the newspaper Mr. Li oversaw had always vehemently condemned malicious forces without reservation. The Hong Kong newspapers were able to report relatively freely, and this greatly angered authorities from a certain quarter. These authorities had special agencies to deal with dissidents in Hong Kong and Macau. It is recalled that Luo Weijiang, the president of the Hong Kong Tiannan Daily, supported the Central Government and also strongly criticized certain authorities. Last year, he was shot as a result. Although Li did not support the Central Government, he was also dissatisfied with certain authorities. Therefore, his murder is similar to Luo's shooting last year. However, Luo was fortunate to survive, while Li died, making it a matter of fortune and misfortune.</p>
<p>Reward for Arrest of Culprit: The Hong Kong Police Authorities, considering that Li Yuan East Street is a prosperous area in the central district, were shocked that assassins dared to act so audaciously and commit murder in broad daylight. Therefore, after Mr. Li's death, they offered a reward of 250 yuan to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Shandong Province Year-End Finances: Deficit of More Than 2.3 Million Yuan, Caused by Floods and Economic Decline <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In recent years, the local situation in this province has been stable, the government has been reorganized, and revenues and expenditures have been balanced. However, this year, we suddenly encountered misfortune. The western half of Shandong suffered severe flooding, and various tax revenues fell sharply. As of the end of January of the 25th year (end of the lunar year), the estimated shortfall was 1.95 million yuan in revenue and 2.836 million yuan in expenditure, along with 600,000 yuan borrowed from treasury bonds before the busy farming season this year, totaling approximately 1.486 million yuan. Furthermore, from February to March of the 25th year, the estimated revenue was 9.7 million yuan and the expenditure was 10.594 million yuan, resulting in an additional shortfall of 894,000 yuan. Combining this with the previous shortfall from January, the total shortfall was over 2.38 million yuan. The Finance Department announced four reasons for this year's deficit: The floods in western Shandong affected over a dozen counties, causing severe damage and resulting in a shortfall of over 900,000 yuan in land tax revenue. Deed tax was a major source of revenue in previous years, but this year, due to economic decline in rural areas and low purchasing power among the people, there was a shortfall of approximately 500,000 yuan. Due to the sluggish market and economic downturn, business tax revenue fell short by over 180,000 yuan. Repayment of principal and interest on loans from the Sino-Japanese Industrial Company amounted to over 790,000 yuan. The total deficit is as stated above. Wang Xiangrong, the Director of the Finance Department, presented this case at the provincial government's political affairs meeting on the 24th, requesting a solution to make up the deficit. It was decided to hand the case over to the Secretariat, the four departments, the judicial department, and the committee for review and research of methods to cover the deficit. (24th)</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Many Injured While Bravely Fighting Fire</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the Zhou family's residence at No. 512 Hulong Street at around 8 PM on the 23rd. Due to the dry weather, the fire spread quickly. Upon receiving the alarm, fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It took two hours to extinguish the blaze, which destroyed more than ten houses and caused over 10,000 yuan in losses. When the fire was raging, many firefighters from the Tongan Fire Brigade of the 17th District of the Northern District carried fire extinguishers and climbed onto the roof to put out the fire. Suddenly, a loud crash was heard, and the roof collapsed, causing the firefighters to fall. Five firefighters, including Su Guirong, Jiang Yulin, Liu Debiao, Han Shuigen, and Li Hongfei, were injured. Su Guirong was the most seriously injured and was immediately sent to Renhe Hospital for treatment. The other injured firefighters were also treated separately. There was also a fight between firefighters from the Yongkang Fire Brigade and the Tongan Fire Brigade due to a misunderstanding. On the 24th, the Northern District Fire Sub-Association summoned the directors of both sides to mediate, and the matter was settled. Su Guirong, who fell and was injured, is no longer in life-threatening condition after receiving treatment. The Firefighters' Association, recognizing that Su Guirong and others had worked hard to fight the fire and risked their lives, resulting in serious injuries, sent representatives to express their condolences on the 24th.</p>

<p>Hotel Guest Commits Suicide by Poisoning After Registration</p>
<p>Jiangsu New Hotel, located at No. 3, 7th Jia, 1st Bao, Fengjing, registered a guest on the afternoon of the 23rd who claimed to be Zhang Yongsheng from Zhangliantang. He rented room number eleven, paid six jiao, and left. He returned to the hotel at 9 PM, closed the door, and stayed inside. At around 8 AM the next morning, the tea server, Mr. Mao, passed by his room and heard moaning sounds. He reported this to the owner, Xu Zhongming, who opened the door and entered the room. The guest's face was pale, and he did not respond to inquiries. Xu Zhongming reported this to the Second Sub-Bureau of Public Security and called two doctors for treatment. However, their efforts were ineffective, and the guest died at noon. The Second Sub-Bureau of Public Security reported this to the General Bureau and sent a letter to the local court's prosecutor's office requesting an autopsy.</p>

<p>Cheng and Liang's Examining Officers Detained for Accepting Bribes</p>
<p>Zhou Xiang, an examining officer in Jiangyin County, was recently accused by citizens there to the High Court for bribery and dereliction of duty. President Zhu sent people to Cheng to secretly investigate, and Zhou Xiang was dismissed and investigated and sent to the Wuxi Local Court Procuratorate for investigation. Yesterday, the High Court sent police to escort Zhou Xiang to Wuxi. The former Jiangyin examining officer Shi Wending, who was related to the case, was summoned to the court by the police. Prosecutor Shen opened a court hearing, and as a result, ordered them to be detained together pending review.</p>

<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Zhejiang University Agricultural School Initiates National Agricultural Salvation Movement</p>
<p>The Junior Department of the Provincial Hangzhou Agricultural Vocational School, which is administered by the National Zhejiang University, has been established since last summer. Although it has not been two years, the teachers and students of the school have always been able to work hard and diligently, focusing on both academics and practice to cultivate practical talents. Therefore, they have won the praise of all parties, and the results have been considerable. It is learned that the entire faculty and students of the school, in view of the serious national crisis, unanimously believe that the fundamental solution to saving the country is to develop agriculture and increase production, so as to cultivate national strength and prepare for foreign aggression. This is currently the only good policy for saving the country. Therefore, they launched a national agriculture movement the day before yesterday (the 24th) to awaken the people of all counties and to devote themselves to production and national salvation work. There are three objectives: It is different to use rescue groups and to improve agriculture and increase production to enrich the national treasury, and national preparations are the only way to save the country at present. Connect with farmers and work together to solve people's livelihoods, consolidate the national foundation, and use foreign aggression as a standard. Arouse the people of the whole country to actively engage in production work, and produce a large amount of food in a short period of time to serve as military food in times of emergency and as a government backup. It is said that since the school's faculty and students launched the above-mentioned movement, they have recently stepped up their work, encouraging nearby farmers to cultivate more and holding competitions for rice seeds and plowing cattle. All parties are contacted to prepare for the implementation of the National Salvation Movement throughout the country.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Heavy Snow in Hangzhou <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The weather in Hangzhou is bitterly cold. On the 24th, the sky was overcast and heavily clouded, and the north wind was very strong, biting at people's skin. Heavy snow began to fall at 3:40 PM, and it snowed even harder in the evening. It has not stopped as of tonight (the 25th). The snow has accumulated quite thickly on the streets, and the municipal government has sent street sweepers along with police officers to mobilize and clear the snow to facilitate pedestrians. However, the snow accumulates as quickly as it is swept away, and the roads are muddy and difficult to walk on. The mountains around West Lake have become a powdery, jade-like scene, with three to four inches of snow accumulation. This is the first heavy snow of this winter. In order to facilitate people from all walks of life to visit Mogan Mountain to see the snow scene, the Provincial Highway Bureau is operating one round trip of the Shanghai-Moganshan Joint Transport bus from the 25th to the 15th of next month, departing from the city station at 12:50 PM and from Moganshan at 11:10 AM.</p>
<p>Ningbo</p>
<p>Middle School Students' Anti-Puppet Parade</p>
<p>More than 3,000 students from eight middle schools in this city, including Xiaoshi, Ye Nu, Ningzhong, Business School, Yongjiang Girls' High School, Zhedong, Zhengshi, and Senior Industrial School, held a large parade at 10 AM on the 23rd in order to respond to the students of various universities in Peiping and Tianjin, protect the territorial integrity of North China, and awaken the patriotic sentiments of the people. More than 3,000 people participated, starting from the Public Sports Field, passing through Beida Road, Dongmen, Nanmen Ring Road, Xinjiang Bridge, Jiangbei Bank, and other places, shouting slogans such as "Swear to oppose North China autonomy", "Down with traitors", "Take back lost territories", and "Support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek". The attitude was tragic and the order was good, which moved the public greatly. At more than 2 PM, they gathered at the Sports Field again, and the students elected two representatives to the county government to invite County Magistrate Chen to speak at the scene. County Magistrate Chen arrived at the scene at about 3 PM and encouraged the students to not forget studying while saving the country, and to not forget saving the country while studying. He also advised them to return to school because the students were parading on an empty stomach. The students were deeply moved and returned in formation.</p>
<p>Fuzhou</p>
<p>Higher Court of Justice Undergoing Major Renovation</p>
<p>The buildings of the Fujian Higher Court of Justice were originally converted from the former Qing Nie Shu. No president of the court has paid attention to repairs over the years, resulting in a dilapidated state. In the summer of this year, storms and rains blew down the first courtroom, the fourth courtroom, and the storage room. A repair estimate was reluctantly made, and the repair funds were approved in the budget for the 24th year. President Zhang Hangshi, for the sake of one-time completion, was scheduled to start work in August and complete the renovation by the end of October. Unexpectedly, although work began in August, not a single penny of the repair money was received until the end of September, and work had to be temporarily suspended. At the end of last month, another strong wind and rain caused the main hall of the main building to tilt completely, threatening to collapse. President Tong, seeing this crisis, had to raise labor and purchase materials for major repairs. Therefore, the interior and exterior of the court will soon be completely renovated.</p>
<p>Wenzhou</p>
<p>Supervisor Xu Inspects Various Customs Stations</p>
<p>Since taking office, Xu Hongbin, the Wenzhou Ouhai Customs Supervisor, has spared no effort in reorganizing customs affairs. Recently, in view of the increasingly strict anti-smuggling work, especially the repeated cracking of cases involving smuggling of silver, Mr. Xu believed that it was necessary to personally inspect the vast area of the customs station, which was full of port texts. On the 20th of this month, he led Customs Assistant Qiao Ruyong and others to ride the Customs Yongxing patrol ship to the coasts of the Wentai region, examining the area north from Linhai to the coast of Pingyang, and inspecting the Haimen Gu'ao Head Second Sub-Card. He also took the opportunity to widely publicize the Ministry of Finance's implementation of the new monetary system, so that all private businesses could easily understand it. It is also heard that after Mr. Xu returns to the customs station after this inspection, he plans to formulate a rectification plan based on the inspection results, in order to prevent the export of smuggled silver and the import of smuggled goods, increase national tax revenue, and promote legal tender.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Italy's Economic Crisis: Exports Sharply Decline, Economic Prospects Cause Concern; Domestic Prices Soar, People Panic; Impact of the League of Nations' Economic Sanctions <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Rome Dispatch: The economic sanctions imposed by the League of Nations officially began on November 18th. It is widely known that Britain played the most active role in Geneva to ensure the implementation of these sanctions. The reason given for this is the ostensibly praiseworthy [stopping aggressive behavior]. However, when our Northeast Four Provinces were ravaged, we repeatedly requested the League of Nations to implement sanctions, but we never heard anyone championing justice like Britain at that time make any pronouncements. Today's situation is also due to conflicts of interest among the great powers, who are using this Geneva body as a tool to deal with each other. Although it sets a precedent that we can use in the future to demand that League of Nations member states also impose sanctions on those who aggress against our country, it is still highly questionable whether the current movement is based on justice. We will not discuss the background of the movement any further. In terms of the economic sanctions currently being implemented, Italy is suffering a great impact. Italy is located on a peninsula, with only the Lombardy area bordering France, Austria, and Switzerland being plains. The rest is either mountainous or barren. Mineral resources are scarce, and raw material production is extremely limited, relying heavily on imports from abroad. Currently, among the League of Nations member states, except for Austria, Hungary, Albania, and Uruguay, the remaining thirty-eight countries are participating in unreserved economic sanctions against Italy. Another thirteen countries are implementing economic sanctions against Italy with reservations. According to the principles of economic sanctions, all cannot import raw materials and mineral products into Italy. If we look at global production, essential raw materials are produced in countries that are implementing sanctions against Italy. From the above figures, we can see that most of the raw materials and minerals needed by Italy are in countries that are implementing economic sanctions against Italy, ranging from 100% to 73%. As for coal and oil, Italy imported over 117.8 million quintals of coal last year, mainly from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland. It also imported over 1.5 million quintals of oil, mainly from the Soviet Union, Persia, Romania, and the United States. Gasoline imports totaled 3.48 million quintals, mainly from Romania, the Dutch East Indies, and Persia and Romania. Except for the United States and Germany, which are not members of the League of Nations, the rest are participating in the economic sanctions against Italy. There is currently a proposal to add coal and oil to the sanctions list, which would inflict an even greater blow on Italy. Yesterday, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the foreign embassies in Italy that all oil, gasoline, sugar, and coffee, etc., that could previously be purchased duty-free, must be purchased directly from abroad by the embassies themselves. From December 15th, they will no longer be able to purchase them duty-free within Italy. This measure is a preliminary move to retaliate against countries imposing economic sanctions against Italy, and also to conserve the use of its domestic inventory. The application of gasoline is crucial for military aircraft, industrial activities, and transportation. If the source is cut off for even one day, the impact will be even greater than the food supply being cut off, hence this great panic.</p>
<p>From November 18th to the 28th, only ten days, it is still difficult to estimate the extent of the impact on Italy. However, soaring prices have become a very common phenomenon. Even daily necessities, except for bread and noodles, etc., cannot be avoided. It is universally acknowledged that life is becoming increasingly difficult here. It is generally known that the gold reserves and foreign exchange reserves of the Italian Bank (National Bank) have decreased by 25% in the past four months, about 430 million lire. If this continues, it will continue to decrease. If there is no improvement in military or diplomatic affairs, then, given this the people are in a state of panic or perhaps a more panic-stricken period will arrive. Therefore, many are tightening their belts to prepare for any eventuality, and some are even combining three meals into two. The situation can be seen at a glance. Government agencies have shortened office hours, and shops are following suit to save electricity. Elevators in households are either abandoned or only used for going up but not down, and cannot be remotely controlled from upper levels to go down and pick people up, etc. All of these are for saving money and electricity. It is said that public buses may be temporarily completely suspended to save gasoline, and trams will also reduce services, encouraging people to walk to and from, to help the country's economy. All of these are phenomena of the past ten days, indicating that it has already been deeply affected by economic sanctions. In addition, looking at Italy's overall trade situation, we can see that if economic sanctions continue to be implemented, Italy's economic and financial situation will be greatly affected. Last year, over 60% of Italy's goods exports were to countries that are currently implementing economic sanctions against Italy. These countries have now tightly closed their customs doors. It is not easy to find other countries as sales outlets in a short period of time. Here is a simple table to show Italy's export situation. If other outlets are sought, but there is still no quick and proper solution, then Italy's entire financial and economic future is very dangerous and worrying.</p>

<p>Former Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and currently Standing Director-General of the Ministry of Communications and Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tang Youren, was ambushed and shot by two thugs lurking at the rear gate steps of his residence at 235 Gan Village, Gan Shidong Road, French Concession, at around 4:45 PM yesterday as he returned from visiting guests. Mr. Tang was shot several times and died on the spot. The assailants all escaped. Mr. Tang's body has been moved to the Public Works Department Hospital on Tairas Road to await entombment. The French Police Department is taking this case very seriously. Details are reported below.</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai from Beijing</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Youren, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, resigned after the recent Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the Fifth National Congress concluded and the ministers of the central government's ministries were re-elected. He was reappointed as Standing Director-General of the Ministry of Communications and Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the night express train on the 23rd and returned to his private residence at 235 Gan Village, Gan Shidong Road, French Concession.</p>
<p>Visiting Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>After arriving at his residence in Shanghai on the morning of the day before yesterday, Mr. Tang visited Mr. Wang Jingwei at Anhe Temple Road in the afternoon and then returned to his residence. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, he went out again by car (concession license number 6934, Chinese area license number 3150), first visiting Mr. Wang again. He returned to his residence for lunch and went out again at 1:00 PM, first visiting relatives and friends at Yuyuan Road, and then to Mr. Zhang Gongquan, the new Minister of Railways, at 705 Julieda Road.</p>
<p>Car Returning to Gan Village</p>
<p>Mr. Tang and Zhang Gongquan had a long private conversation and left at around 4:45 PM, ordering the driver to drive back to his residence. When the car arrived at the entrance of the lane in Gan Village, because Tang's residence was the third house in the lane, facing south and north, and the width of the lane was less than one zhang (about 3.3 meters), the car could not turn around. Therefore, when Tang's car arrived at the entrance of the lane, it reversed into the lane. When the car backed up to the back door, Mr. Tang got out of the car leisurely.</p>
<p>Thugs Attacking from Both Sides</p>
<p>After Mr. Tang got out of the car, he knocked on the back door twice, but no one opened the door. At this time, Tang's youngest son was inside and asked loudly when he heard the sound, "Is Daddy back?" Tang replied, "Yes." Unexpectedly, before Tang finished answering, two thugs wearing gray-yellow breeches and overcoats rushed out from the front and back of the car, pulled out pistols, and attacked Mr. Tang from both sides. When Mr. Tang saw that the situation was not good, he quickly turned around and took large steps onto the cement steps, intending to escape into the back door on the second floor.</p>
<p>Double Guns Firing Simultaneously</p>
<p>The cement steps at the back door of Tang's residence have thirteen steps, leading directly to the back door on the second floor. At that time, Mr. Tang had just stepped onto the third step when the two thugs could no longer wait and aimed their guns at him and fired simultaneously, firing a total of eight or nine shots. Mr. Tang was less than five steps away, so he was shot three times all over his body, and all were vital areas. However, Mr. Tang was still a strong young man and finally managed to climb to the top of the steps and pushed against the back door, shouting for help. Coincidentally, when Mr. Tang knocked on the back door downstairs after getting out of the car, and at the same time Tang's youngest son asked loudly, a female relative on the second floor had already heard Tang knocking on the back door downstairs, thinking that Tang had already entered from the back door downstairs, and never expected that Tang would encounter violence downstairs and escape to the second floor.</p>
<p>Barely Alive</p>
<p>It was not until the female relative heard the continuous gunshots and Tang shouting for help outside the door that she realized something was wrong. By the time she opened the door, Tang had already fallen into the back door in a pool of blood. At the same time, Tang's wife, Ouyang Liwei (the sister of the famous playwright Ouyang Yuqian), was sitting on the bed because she had been feeling unwell for several days. Suddenly hearing the gunshots, she knew that something had happened. By the time she put on her shoes and ran out, Tang was already lying in a pool of blood. When he saw his wife, he could only open his mouth to signal, barely alive.</p>
<p>Assailants Escaped</p>
<p>At that time, Tang's chauffeur witnessed the thugs firing and was so frightened that he was stunned. After the thugs ran away and escaped, he regained his composure and got out of the car to report to a Vietnamese policeman at the corner of Gan Shidong Road. By the time the policeman arrived, the thugs had already disappeared without a trace. At this time, Tang's wife quickly helped Tang onto the car and rushed him to Niu Huilin Hospital. After Dr. Niu examined him, he determined that all three shots were in vital areas. One bullet entered from the right flank and exited from the left armpit, one bullet entered from the right waist but did not penetrate, and one bullet entered from the right buttock and penetrated the left hip. Dr. Niu determined that there was no hope of survival.</p>
<p>Died from Serious Injuries</p>
<p>He then ordered him to be rushed to Guangci Hospital, but the hospital refused to admit him because no police officers accompanied him. He had no choice but to be transferred to the Lugiawan General Police Station. At this time, Tang's eyeballs only made a final glance before he was pronounced dead from serious injuries. Seeing that Tang had died, the police station ordered him to be sent to the Public Works Department Hospital (i.e., the small ward) on Tairas Road and placed in the attached mortuary, awaiting a report to the Second Special Court to send someone to examine the body.</p>
<p>Strict Investigation of Assailants</p>
<p>After the incident, the French Police Department dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to Tang's residence for a thorough investigation, collected all the bullet casings dropped by the thugs, recorded them, and kept them for future reference. According to the chauffeur's statement, there were indeed three assailants at the time, but only two acted. Several hours before the incident, a red sedan was seen parked there for a long time. After the incident, the car disappeared. At the same time, Mayor Wu Tiecheng also received a report and immediately sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to Tang's residence to express condolences, and then went to the French Consulate General and the French Police Department to request a strict investigation of the fugitives. At the same time, the municipal government ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to assist in the strict investigation. At the same time, Tang's residence telegraphed to the central government and Tang's brother, Bu Nian, and his younger brother, Gui Liang, to come to Shanghai to take charge of the funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Tang's Background</p>
<p>Tang's name is Lin, 42 years old, from Liuyang, Hunan. He is a revolutionary veteran and the second son of Tang Caichang. His mother is still alive. He studied in Shanghai in his early years and then went to Japan to study law at Keio University, where his academic performance was outstanding among his peers and was praised by teachers and friends. After graduating in the eighth year of the Republic (1919), he returned to China and was recruited by the Bank of China to preside over the Economic Investigation Office, focusing on research on finance and economics, and made many contributions to the Bank of China. In the seventeenth year of the Republic (1928), the Bank of China headquarters moved south, so he came to Shanghai. When Tang was in Japan, due to his family background, he had many contacts with Kuomintang comrades, and was especially valued by veterans such as Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. After coming to Shanghai, he traveled back and forth frequently, and quickly distinguished himself. Therefore, when Wang Jingwei also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he recruited Tang to assist him. During his more than two years in office, he adhered to the central government's diplomatic policies, shouldering the important responsibility of negotiation, and did not complain about the hard work, bearing both praise and criticism. Tang sought the best for the nation and the clan, and should have no regrets at the moment. However, he repeatedly applied to the party and national authorities for resignation and distant travel, but was not granted permission. Friends, seeing Tang's difficult situation and the difficulty in distinguishing right from wrong, advised Tang to be vigilant, but Tang remained indifferent, so he suffered this misfortune. He left behind two sons and two daughters. The eldest daughter, San Cheng, is only ten years old, the second daughter, Lian Cheng, is six years old, the eldest son, Wencheng, is seven years old, and the youngest son, Man Cheng, is four years old. It is faintly heard that Tang recently purchased land on Guanyintang Road in the downtown area to build a new mansion, magnificent and about to be completed. Unexpectedly, he has already suffered this tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Student Petitioners Arrive in Kunshan and Suzhou; A Group of Students Returned to Shanghai Last Night; Enduring Hardships in Rain and Snow; Beijing and Shanghai Should Avoid [Conflict] and Offer Joint Comfort; Tongji Students Returned First Last Night <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the two trains carrying petitioning students, which departed from the North Station the day before yesterday (24th) afternoon, arrived at Kunshan Station around 8 or 9 PM that night. The first train was mostly filled with students from Fudan University, with the remainder from Guangxia Middle School, China Middle School, Jianguo Middle School, Shibei Middle School, and other schools, totaling about six or seven hundred people. The second train was almost entirely composed of students from Tongji University and Xiangji Senior Vocational School, numbering four or five hundred. The students on the first train forced the driver to proceed to Suzhou. Yesterday morning, they further compelled the stationmaster in Suzhou to order the driver to depart, but due to damaged tracks, they had to stop at Wangting Station. The students from Tongji University and the vocational school on the second train were also quite enthusiastic. Initially, they were delayed due to a lack of a locomotive. Later, when a third and fourth-class train arrived in Kunshan from Beijing, the students immediately forced the driver to attach the locomotive to their train cars, preparing to depart. However, Li Dachao, the chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, had already led several officials from the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Education, rushing to Kunshan Station overnight, repeatedly dissuading them. The Shanghai Municipal Security Force also deployed to Kunshan Station to maintain order, awaiting further instructions. As a result, the third and fourth-class passenger train and the student train cars remained deadlocked and were unable to depart. Peng Baichuan, the magistrate of Kunshan County, acting on orders from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, received the students, providing food and drink. At night, rain and snow fell heavily, and the weather turned abruptly cold, but the students' spirits remained high. At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, accompanied by Ma Zongrong, a special secretary dispatched by the Ministry of Education to Shanghai by plane, along with Jiang Jianbai, the Director of the Education Bureau, and over ten officials from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Education, rushed to Kunshan. They first consulted with Magistrate Peng, and then proceeded to the station with Chief Li and others. They began by earnestly explaining the government's intentions to several representatives of the Tongji students, and then urged all the students to disembark and form a line on the platform. Secretary Ma, Director Pan, Chief Li, and others sincerely persuaded and explained with heartfelt words and tears. They also promised to relay all the petition requests to the central government. The students were deeply moved. Wang Zuozhou and Jing Zhide, representatives of the Tongji Senior Vocational School National Salvation Association, first stated on behalf of their classmates that they would comply with President Jiang's repeated telegrams of encouragement. Because the authorities' persuasion was sincere and earnest, because the second and fourth-class passenger trains had been delayed for a day and a night, causing deep unease, and because the tracks ahead were damaged, making it impossible to proceed further and staying in Kunshan would be futile, they expressed their willingness to return to Shanghai immediately. However, they hoped that Director Pan and others would relay their six demands to the central government for adoption: 1. Oppose the puppet autonomous region in North China; 2. Safeguard territorial integrity; 3. Ban and revise textbooks in North China; 4. Punish those who suppress students' patriotic movements; 5. Provide compensation to injured students in North China; 6. Punish traitors like Yin Rugeng. This request was granted. Subsequently, Weng Zhilong, the President of Tongji University, along with professors and students' parents, arrived in Kunshan by train to jointly offer comfort. The university students also decided to return to school as a group, showing their sincere patriotism and refusing to be exploited by external forces. Director Pan, Secretary Ma, President Weng, and others were very pleased. They boarded the train with the students back to Shanghai. At that time, the third and fourth-class passenger train had already departed. When the student train left Kunshan, it was already 6:30 PM. This train went directly to Jiangwan and Wusong, where the students disembarked in two groups. It did not stop at any other stations. By 7:30 PM, the Tongji students had safely arrived at their school. As for Fudan University, President Li, Secretary-General Jin, and various professors reportedly also went to Suzhou in batches yesterday to persuade their students to return to Shanghai. It is expected that this train will be able to return to Shanghai from between Wuxi and Suzhou today. The details of what happened are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Two Trains Coupled Together Arrive in Kunshan and Suzhou</p>
<p>Around 5 PM the night before last, the students petitioning in Beijing, departing from the North Station, numbered over 2,300. At that time, the railway bureau coupled them into two trains. The first train had nine first, second, and third-class cars, and the second train had eight first, second, and third-class cars. As the trains departed and arrived at Kunshan, both drivers disembarked and fled one after another. The male and female students were in angry uproar. Then, a student on the first train, with some mechanical knowledge, boldly took on the role of driving. The other students feared there might be obstacles on the tracks, so they obtained a track inspection car to precede them. Thereupon, this train, sounding its horn, proceeded towards Suzhou. As it passed through Zhengyi Station, it had a minor dispute with the stationmaster because its request for waybills was not granted. Suzhou Station, having received the above news, once dismantled a section of the track, but the students managed to overcome this obstacle. The second train remained stationary at Kunshan Station. At 7 PM on the 25th, a telegram from Suzhou stated that the student petition train departed Suzhou westward at 4 PM on the 25th. At Xushuguan, the railway bureau had preemptively dismantled the track, preventing the train from proceeding further. The Ministry of Education dispatched two supervisors, Zhao and Ma, to Suzhou to persuade the students to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Bureau is Persuading in Different Routes</p>
<p>Over two thousand petitioning students from various schools in Shanghai were ordered westward by the authorities the night before last, with the intention of persuading them to return to Shanghai. However, the students firmly refused, resulting in two trains, one stopping at Kunshan and the other at Suzhou. The authorities believed that while the students' actions were admirable, if they all went to Beijing, students from other regions would inevitably follow suit. This would not only greatly impact transportation but also cause various inconveniences in Nanjing. Therefore, they continued to send personnel to explain with goodwill. The Ministry of Education dispatched Secretary Ma Zongrong, Supervisor Hao Gengsheng, and Sun Guofeng, who were sent to Shanghai to persuade the students. They departed yesterday morning at 7 AM, along with Li Dachao, the Chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, Li Denghui, the President of Fudan University, Jin Tongyin, the Secretary-General, and the relevant authorities from other schools, and went to Kunshan and Suzhou to persuade the students. Secretary Ma Zongrong of the Ministry of Education, Director Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Bureau of Education, and Chief Li Dachao of the First Section of the Municipal Government were responsible for persuasion in Kunshan. Supervisor Hao Gengsheng of the Ministry of Education, Sun Guofeng, and President Li Denghui of Fudan University went to Suzhou to persuade the students. (East China News Agency)</p>
<p>Ma Zongrong Talks About Three Points</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM, Ma Zongrong and Pan Gongzhan gathered the Tongji students at Kunshan Station for a speech. Mr. Ma first briefly stated his purpose, then said that he was here on behalf of Minister Wang and had three points to explain to the students: Firstly, he was deeply uneasy about the students' disregard for the severe winter weather, camping in the open air, to participate in the national salvation movement. Therefore, he rushed here on behalf of the central government to offer comfort. Secondly, the government had already accepted all the students' opinions on national affairs expressed in their march and petition. To avoid the students' hardship in the cold journey, President Jiang had stipulated a method: before January 15, presidents of Shanghai universities would be gathered, and each school would send one to three student representatives to Beijing to jointly contribute and present their opinions on national salvation. Thirdly, if the students felt that the deadline was too far away and could not wait, the Ministry of Education had sent people like him to come first. If they had any opinions, they could submit them in writing or verbally to him so that he could forward them to Minister Wang, who would then forward them to President Jiang. As for the opinions previously raised, the central government had already fully understood them. However, the capacity of Beijing was limited. If all university students in the country wanted to go to Beijing, not only would the city be unable to accommodate them, but their studies would also be neglected, which would be a great pity. (National News Agency)</p>
<p>Pan Uses the Example of Students in North China</p>
<p>Director Pan Gongzhan of the Bureau of Education then earnestly advised, believing that the students in Peiping and Tianjin were in a more profound situation and faced greater stimulation than those in Shanghai. When the students went to Beijing to petition and were blocked in Cangzhou, the Ministry of Education, upon hearing the news, also sent representatives to offer comfort. As a result, the students and representatives spoke to the point of embracing and weeping together. At this time, the students also felt the nation's crisis and reluctantly returned. In short, at this time, it is necessary to bury oneself in hard work. If all students in the country went to Beijing at the same time, not only would their studies be affected, but the central government's work would also be impacted, which would not be a way to save the country. He hoped they would return. (National News Agency)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>A telegram from Suzhou, New Voice News Agency, 7 PM on the 25th, states that Zhang Taiyan delivered a speech, expressing deep sympathy for the students' patriotic movement. However, he believed that the government authorities should handle it properly and should not rashly label them as communists or use force to stop them. He believed that the government and education authorities should be responsible for providing food to the hungry and cold students and taking good care of them along the way.</p>
<p>Tongji Students Return to School from Kunshan</p>
<p>Over three hundred students from Tongji University and its affiliated vocational and middle schools followed the Shanghai students to Beijing the night before last (24th). The train stopped at Kunshan Station and could not proceed. It was already late at night, and rain and snow were falling heavily. The students were both hungry and cold, and their situation was pitiful. The school authorities, upon hearing the news, were extremely anxious. They quickly purchased a large number of bread and canned food and hired cars to send them to where the students were staying. Yesterday morning around 10 AM, President Weng Zhilong, Secretary-General Du Dianying, Director Tang of the vocational school, Director Lu of the affiliated middle school, and over twenty faculty members departed from the school and temporarily negotiated with the North Station to request a special train to pick up the students and return them to school. The railway bureau approved the request, and the special train departed at 3 PM, arriving in Kunshan around 4 PM. They saw that the students, despite traveling through wind and snow, were in good order and full of vitality, showing their patriotic enthusiasm. At that time, Director Shen of the Municipal Bureau of Education led many officials from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Education, earnestly advising them. With the school authorities' sympathy and persuasion, the students understood the greater good and immediately held a meeting, deciding to return to school with the teachers. Around 6 PM, the train slowly returned to Shanghai, heading directly to Jiangwan and Wusong. By 7:30 PM, everyone had returned to their respective schools.</p>
<p>Affiliated Middle School of Fudan University Asks to Retain the President</p>
<p>Since hearing the news of President Li's resignation, all the teachers and students of the Affiliated Middle School of Fudan University have been deeply uneasy. Director Gu Yiwen personally went to persuade him yesterday morning. In the afternoon, a meeting of faculty members was convened, and it was unanimously decided to nominate Li Baiyuan, Leng Xueqiao, and Guo Zhiliang to present a letter of retention to President Li and request him to retract his resignation. The original letter is as follows: To President Denghui, Upon learning that you have expressed a desire to resign due to the student unrest in Shanghai, we are deeply uneasy. Our school has a history of thirty years, with an outstanding reputation and excellent achievements. Without your guidance, we would not have been able to achieve this. At this time of turbulent student unrest, the future of our school depends on your efforts to maintain it. After a unanimous decision by the faculty, Li Baiyuan and Leng Xueqiao are nominated to come and urge you to withdraw your resignation and continue to take on this difficult task. We hope that you will come to the school to give us instructions.</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Students Paraded Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The National Salvation Association of Students of National Jiaotong University in this city, in order to shift public attention and arouse popular unity for national salvation, gathered over three hundred students from various colleges at 8 AM yesterday morning, organized them into a team, and departed from the school, passing through Longhua Road, Rihui Bridge, turning into Xietu Road, passing Xie Bridge, and entering the Republic of China Road, making a circum-city parade, shouting slogans along the way and extensively promoting national salvation to the public. The team was orderly and in good order. Around 1 PM, they returned to school and continued to attend classes as usual. There were no other unexpected incidents. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<p>Datong University Set Out for Propaganda</p>
<p>The private Datong University and Datong Affiliated Middle School in this city established a propaganda team, which departed yesterday morning in groups to propagate to the public in the areas of Zhonghua Road, Wenmiao Road, Minguo Road, Xiaodongmen, South Railway Station Road, and Laoximen. Each group consisted of twenty to thirty people, and many people gathered to watch. The students of the school also printed declarations and distributed them along the way. The content of the declaration was: resolutely deny all pseudo-organizations that undermine national integrity, recover the lost territories in Northeast and North China, execute all traitors and national criminals, request the government to protect patriotic movements throughout the country, unite patriotic organizations throughout the country, and unite all Chinese people to jointly face national crises. Around 4 PM, they gradually returned to school. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<p>China National Salvation Association Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>The China National Salvation Association convened its first standing committee meeting at 7 PM yesterday, chaired by the "Ta Kung Pao", to discuss several important cases and issued the following declaration: With the loss of the Northeast and the danger in North China, the traitor Yin Rugeng first betrayed the country, and then the pseudo-autonomous movement, falsely claiming popular opinion, arose. All revolutionary people are indignant. The students in Peiping, being in a dangerous situation, could not bear the loss of the motherland and rose up to save the country. The students in Shanghai were eager to save the country and dared not fall behind. In addition to marching and petitioning to express their will, they organized this association to engage in a sustained and arduous struggle. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>

<p>Secondary Schools Obey the Order to Take a Holiday</p>
<p>Since the Bureau of Education issued an order for all secondary schools to take an early holiday, all schools have complied with the order yesterday and no classes were held. Reporters from Shanghai News Agency specifically inspected various schools in Nanshi yesterday, such as Wuben, Minli, Ai Qun, Jingye, Da Gong, Minli Girls' Middle School, Kaiming, Junyi, and Huadong. All of them had announced the holiday. Most of the day students did not come to school. Boarding students were picked up by their parents. Therefore, there were many vehicles in front of each school, carrying luggage. Students from other places who were on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway were unable to return home due to transportation reasons and remained in school. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<p>Classes Can Be Resumed on January 6</p>
<p>The annual holiday for schools in this city, according to the regulations of the Bureau of Education, is from New Year's Day for five days. This early holiday refers to the annual holiday. Reporters from Shanghai News Agency learned from the Bureau of Education yesterday that the Bureau of Education's notice was to advance the annual holiday by a few days. If the student movement can return to normal within these few days, then classes will resume as usual after the annual holiday, and the annual holiday will not be connected to the winter vacation. Classes can be resumed on January 6. As for the date of the winter vacation, it must be after January 2. Therefore, starting yesterday, all secondary schools have complied with the order. If any school fails to comply with the order and any accident occurs, the principal will be held responsible. (Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<p>Xi Yushu and Others Donate Food</p>
<p>Xi Yushu and others from the Fudan University Alumni Association purchased 200 yuan worth of food from Guanshengyuan, hired a car yesterday morning, and sent it to Suzhou to donate to Fudan students and persuade them to return to school.</p>
<p>Northern Station is Still Partially Under Martial Law</p>
<p>Military and police agencies worked all night in the police office at the North Station the night before last. At the same time, the area around the North Station was still heavily guarded by armed military and police. Barricades were set up on Kesonghai Road, Bingshan Road, and Zhejiang Road. The lights inside the station were dim. Except for the police, no pedestrians passed through. Since the suspension of trains at the North Station on the afternoon of the 23rd, passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai line have switched to taking buses on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway. However, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line is still operating at the South Station and has not been interrupted. The Shanghai-Jiading commuter train and the Songhu branch line passenger trains are operating intermittently. Therefore, passengers feel deeply distressed. According to general statistics, the two railway bureaus have suffered losses of 300,000 yuan in passenger and freight transport. It is not yet possible to inspect and clarify whether there has been any damage to the trains.</p>
<h3 id="e107">University Faculty and Staff Association Issued Its Second Declaration Yesterday; The Nation Should Support the Patriotic Enthusiasm of Young People; Do Not Rashly Suppress Them Unless They Are Taking Advantage of the Situation to Cause Trouble <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Faculty and Staff Association of various universities in this city, being in a position to lead university students, cannot remain silent in the face of the current surging student unrest. It must express its views to guide the students towards the true path of national salvation. Therefore, after issuing a declaration on the current situation, it convened a meeting of executive and supervisory committee members a few days ago and immediately decided to issue another important declaration on the current situation. It clearly expressed its views on the national salvation steps for university professors and the attitude we should take towards the student movement. The general idea is that the nation should unanimously adhere to the following propositions: strictly rectify the diplomatic lineup, concentrate national strength to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, do not allow any special administrative organizations within the country that undermine unity to prevent disguised national treason by traitors, intellectual elites across the country, especially university professors, should fulfill their duties and quickly seek close organization and orderly steps to lead the people across the country and strive for effective national salvation work as a backing for the government to resist the enemy, the patriotic enthusiasm and movement of young students should be fully admired and assisted by all Chinese people, unless there are excesses that take advantage of the situation to cause trouble, the administrative authorities should not rashly suppress them to preserve the vitality of the Chinese nation.</p>

<p>An urgent message from all students of Aurora University: the Shanghai News and all newspapers nationwide are informed that the North China incident, in which a few traitors are using names and labels to damage national unity, have been strongly opposed by the Peiping and Tianjin students, while the local police have used force, which is outrageous. Aside from expressing their deepest sympathy to the students in North China, all our students ask the Central government to issue a formal declaration of war. We, as the backup, vow to stand up for the cause.</p>

At that time, Central Committee member Hu Hanmin might travel to Beijing with them. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Returning South Together Zou arrived in Shanghai to wait for the ship and met with Liu Luyin and others. Yesterday, Liu decided to return south with Zou. Liu took the Da Lai ferry at 11:45 AM, while Zou took the Customs Jinghui special ferry at 12:10 PM, both from the new customs pier, crossing the Huangpu River to board the ship. The ship left Shanghai from the Da Lai wharf in Bailianjing, Pudong, at 1 PM. Those who went south on the same ship yesterday also included Central Committee member Mai Huanzhang. However, Central Committee member Hu Wencan stayed in Shanghai temporarily because, during the Fifth National Congress, it was decided that the Central Committee would allocate construction funds to Sun Yat-sen University and reimburse Guangdong for military expenses advanced during the Northern Expedition. Hu still needs to contact the Central Committee to achieve a result before returning south. Therefore, he will stay in Beijing and Shanghai for about a week.</p>
<p>Tan and Others See Off At that time, those who went to the pier to see them off included Vice President of the Judicial Yuan Tan Zhen, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs Tang Haian, Central Committee member Hu Wencan, Commissioner Xie Cufu of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government, Wu Zhinan, the representative of the Shanghai Security Department Director Yang Hu, and Wang Zhisheng, Qian Chengju, Hu Xiyuan, Zhang Juansheng, and friends of Zou and Liu such as Wang Xiaoya, Zhang Mumin, and Huang Huabiao, totaling thirty people.</p>
<p>Zou's Speech Zou, before leaving at the new customs pier, gave a speech to the New Voice News reporter, saying that his return south was due to public and private matters such as school affairs at Zhongshan University in Guangzhou that needed to be handled. After passing through Hong Kong on this trip, he would transfer back to Guangdong. The rumor that he would go to Singapore to welcome Mr. Hu was not accurate. As for Mr. Hu's return to China, we had already set off after leaving France. I have not received confirmation. When Mr. Hu returns to China, he will, of course, pass through Hong Kong because of the shipping schedule. I plan to come north again in about a month, after the matter is settled. At that time, Mr. Hu can travel to Beijing with me.</p>

<p>Shanghai Times News Agency reports that yesterday was the 20th anniversary of Yunnan's support for the Republic. The Yunnan sojourners in Shanghai held a meeting at noon yesterday at the Youth Association on the 9th floor of Baxianqiao to commemorate the event and continued to hold the 6th Congress of all sojourners. Over one hundred people attended the meeting, chaired by Mr. Zhang Yaozeng. After the meeting started and the opening remarks were made, Mr. Yin Shuhuan, who participated in the revolution, reported on the military process of opposing the imperial system. His speech was roughly divided into three points: the relationship between the Yunnan Army and the National Revolution, the understanding of the fearless spirit of the National Protection Army, and the causes and consequences of the gains and losses of the Yunnan Army in the Chinese military status. The report was very detailed and the language was sincere. Lu Zian, the member of the Yunnan Provincial Government and director of the Finance Department, gave a speech, saying that he took the opportunity to attend the Fifth National Congress to pass through Shanghai and was able to participate in this grand meeting, which made him think about Yunnan's support for the Republic. The success of Yunnan's support for the Republic was purely due to the Yunnan leaders and the Yunnan people's recognition of justice and their love, not due to external agitation. Therefore, this glorious history must be fought for by Yunnan. Yunnan did not hesitate to sacrifice for national protection and the suffering it endured in order to win this great memorial should recognize the value of this memorial. The language was earnest and sincere. Li Liejun, a senior who participated in this revolution, also sent a telegram of congratulations, which read, "To the Yunnan sojourners in Shanghai, at this time of hardship, we should shake off our decline. Looking back, we cannot help but feel the vicissitudes. However, the great strategy of our predecessors and the noble spirit of Yunnan will surely shine through the ages. Respectfully, Li Liejun." Zhao Chengbo read an article about the memories of the Yunnan Uprising on behalf of Mr. Li Liejun. Zhu Gaoru, the brigade commander, then explained the spirit of the Yunnan Army carrying on the national protection, participating in the revolutionary Northern Expedition, and fighting against Japan in Shandong. After a joyful meal, at 2 PM in the afternoon, the 6th Yunnan Sojourners Congress was held to discuss many proposals. Then the executive and supervisory committee members were re-elected. Zhang Yaozeng, Song Chongjiu, Zhang Yongseng, and others received the most votes. The meeting adjourned happily at 5 PM.</p>

<p>December 25th is the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. The municipal party headquarters specially convened representatives from all circles on this day to hold a commemoration meeting. Chairman Xing Wan of the Municipal Committee reported the significance of the commemoration. The meeting adjourned without chanting slogans. The details of the commemoration meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Attending from All Circles</p>
<p>Those attending the commemoration meeting included: Xing Wan of the Municipal Committee, Wang Zongyan of the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office, Zhang Lichun of the Municipal Education Association, Lin Kecong of the Municipal Women's Association, Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Sheng Yizhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Jiang Shouchun of National Tongji University, Bao Jiasheng of the First District Paper Industry Association, Yu Yaoqiu of the Baoshan Fellow Villagers Association, and over a hundred people, including staff members from all levels of the party headquarters, various schools, and the entire staff of the municipal party headquarters, presided over by Chairman Xing Wan.</p>
<p>Chairman Reports the Significance</p>
<p>After performing the customary rites, Chairman Xing Wan delivered a report, stating roughly that today is the 21st anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. On December 12th of the Republic of China's 4th year, Yuan Shikai issued an order to proclaim himself emperor, and the whole country, both the court and the public, rose up in opposition. The Yunnan comrades of our party took the lead in urging Tang Jiyao to express his opposition and telegraphed Yuan Shikai on the 23rd to demand a reply within a limited time. Yuan ignored it and acted wilfully. The generals of Yunnan, filled with righteous indignation, declared independence on the 25th, organized the National Protection Army, and set out for the provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. Before long, comrades in various provinces responded one after another. Yuan also knew that the general trend was irreversible and that the will of the people could not be forced, and on March 22nd of the following year, he issued an order to abolish his imperial claim. From this, we can see that the revolutionary forces are sure to suppress all reactionary behaviors. Although the Yunnan Uprising was tens of thousands of miles away from the then Beijing government, the revolutionary forces spread one after another, and Yuan eventually ended up ruined and discredited. The Republic of China's achievements today are of infinite value, he said.</p>
<p>Slogans of the Commemoration Meeting</p>
<p>The Yunnan Uprising was a revolutionary movement to overthrow the imperial system, Commemorate the Yunnan Uprising to eradicate feudal forces, Commemorate the Yunnan Uprising to wipe out national humiliation, Complete the political tutelage construction, Eliminate the Red bandits, Long live the Three Principles of the People, Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party, Long live the Republic of China.</p>

After leading the attendees in performing the rites, he reported on the revolutionary process of the Yunnan Uprising and the significance of the commemoration.

<h3 id="e116">The Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai Railways Will Implement Shanghai West Through-Transport Wagon-Load Service Starting on New Year's Day; Agreed on Regulations for Handling at Each Location and Train Schedules; The Traffic Department Has Notified All Stations <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The joint transportation service operated by the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus has been quite successful. Now, in consultation with the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways, it has been decided to operate through-transport wagon-load direct trains between Shanghai and Xi'an, starting on New Year's Day next year. The Traffic Department has been ordered to notify all stations. The detailed rules for handling have been approved by the ministry. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The through-transport wagon-load train will temporarily have two 40-ton covered wagons attached to each train. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway will dispatch eight wagons, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will dispatch eight wagons, and the Longhai Railway will dispatch sixteen wagons, for a total of thirty-two wagons. These wagons will not be charged rent from each other and will not be included in the transshipment accounts. Each train should have one escort from each railway, and the vehicles of one road are escorted by one escort from one road. It is also stipulated that all wagon-load goods from each station between Beijing and Shanghai, arriving at the Longhai Railway via Xuzhou Station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, or from each station via the Longhai Railway, unless a whole wagon of wagon-load goods can be directly loaded to each of these railways, should all be loaded into these wagon-load trains. As for wagon-load goods arriving at each station of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, they should be loaded into the Shanghai-Xuzhou or Shanghai-Beiping wagon-load trains. After the implementation of the Shanghai West wagon-load train, Xuzhou will no longer handle transshipments. All whole wagons of wagon-load goods arriving at Xuzhou from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway must not be combined with goods arriving at or via the Longhai Railway, so as to avoid confusion. When Beijing-Shanghai Longhai vehicles are damaged on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway should dispatch vehicles to replace and reload the goods, and repair the damaged vehicle. Before the replacement vehicle returns to the original route of the damaged vehicle, it should be returned to the original route. After the original route receives the repaired empty vehicle, it should return the replacement vehicle to Tianjin-Pukou immediately after arriving at Xi'an or Shanghai. When Tianjin-Pukou vehicles are damaged on the Beijing-Shanghai or Longhai Railways, the respective railway should dispatch vehicles to replace them. After the damaged vehicle is repaired and the replacement vehicle returns to the location of the damaged vehicle (Xi'an or Shanghai), they will be exchanged. When Longhai vehicles are damaged on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway or Beijing-Shanghai vehicles are damaged on the Longhai Railway, they should be handled according to the second item.</p>

<p>Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, for the time limit for businesses to exchange and use thin ledger stamps, has received approval from the Ministry of Finance, ending on the commercial general closing day. He specially sent a telegram to notify the provincial federations of commerce yesterday, to inform all chambers of commerce to comply. The original telegram said: All provincial federations of commerce across the country are informed. This association previously received a telegram from the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the Ministry of Finance stipulate the time limit for exchanging and using stamps for ledgers, please forward to the Legislative and Judicial Yuan, and issue a general order to comply. This association forwarded a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, after which, on December 24th of this year, the Ministry of Finance issued approval No. 8205, which stated: I have read your telegram. This case was previously submitted by the Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce. I have already stated that "According to the regulations of the Stamp Tax Law, ledgers must be stamped with 2 jiao of stamps each year. The validity of the stamps should end at the end of December of the Gregorian calendar. However, because the exchange of ledgers in the commercial field is usually after the commercial general closing, the detailed rules for the implementation of the Stamp Tax Law have clearly stipulated in Article 10 that the validity of ledger stamps should end on the commercial general closing day, in order to show flexibility and facilitate matters. The request should not be discussed again," etc. I have received this approval. I should telegraph to your association accordingly, and I hope that you will investigate and inform the chambers of commerce in your province to comply with it. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Invoices Also Serving as Receipts Only Require One Type of Stamp <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Petroleum Industry Association yesterday, instructing on the method of stamping invoices that also serve as receipts. The letter stated: In response, I received your letter of the 24th of this month. If the invoice only has one copy, after it is handed to the customer, it is still stamped by the customer as proof of receipt of the goods, and returned to the seller for inspection. When the seller issues the invoice, they have already affixed enough stamps according to the invoice tax rate. This means that one invoice is used as both an invoice and a receipt for goods. According to Article 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, if the same document has two or more properties, and the tax rates are the same, only one type of stamp should be affixed. Therefore, if this one document is stamped according to the invoice, even if it also serves as a receipt, there is no need to affix another stamp.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the Christmas Day holiday for Europeans and Americans. Western residents in Shanghai celebrated enthusiastically. All Western organizations, schools, institutions, and banks were closed. Starting last night, the Christian churches rang their bells loudly, and morning services were held. The dance halls were open all night, with singing and dancing until dawn. Although the wind and rain persisted from morning to noon, the enthusiasm did not diminish. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Santa Hats and Holly Fill the Streets</p>
<p>Western stores had already decorated with Santa Claus and snow scenes made of holly a few days before Christmas to attract business. Yesterday morning, all Western stores in the streets of the foreign concessions were filled with snow scenes and Santa Claus. The areas where foreigners were concentrated, such as Avenue Joffre, Nanjing Road, and Jing'an Temple Road, had even more Santa Claus figures and winter scenes. Even large stores established by Chinese merchants, such as Sincere, Wing On, and The Sun, also had festive Christmas displays in their shop windows, which were dazzling and spectacular.</p>
<p>Westerners Take Holidays, Churches Hold Services</p>
<p>Westerners from all organizations, schools, institutions, and banks took holidays. They also participated in Christmas services yesterday morning. Because Christmas is one of the four major holidays of the Catholic Church, the churches also held solemn services. At midnight last night, more than twenty Catholic churches in the city held midnight mass, and the bells rang in unison, which could be heard clearly. Believers all went to participate. In the morning, there was still a mass, with scripture readings and singing, which was very solemn and enthusiastic. Its grandeur was rare.</p>
<p>Dance Halls and Singing Continue All Night</p>
<p>Because all places were closed yesterday, the number of tourists at the entertainment venues, cinemas, and amusement parks in the city increased sharply, and business was booming. The dance halls were also specially approved by the Municipal Council to operate all night and gave Christmas gifts to dancers, such as balloons and Santa hats. On the night of the 24th, the dance halls were already full, with fragrant clothes, glittering hairpins, and intertwined skirts. Singing and dancing made people feel like they were in paradise, almost believing that it was a time of peace and prosperity, forgetting that they were in a period of national crisis.</p>

<p>At 9:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, the Hongtai Coal Store at No. 14, Lane 483, Tianjin Road, was suddenly invaded by six armed robbers who used pistols to threaten everyone in the store and prevent them from raising an alarm. They searched and robbed more than 90 yuan in legal tender and fled with shouts. Zhu Jinbao, a worker in the store, immediately followed the thieves. He followed them to the entrance of Xiangfen Lane, where Detective Yang Dechun and Detective Xia Shikui, who were patrolling, were passing by. Zhu shouted to arrest the thieves, and the detectives intercepted Gong Zhixiang, a native of Shaoxing, and found a fake pistol on him. The remaining thieves escaped. Later, according to Gong's confession, they went to Room 8 of the Southeast New Hotel on Whitec Road and Lloyd Road, where they arrested two accomplices, Zhu Aliu and Yao Yuanpin, and recovered the original stolen goods. The next morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. Court Lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case and requested an extension of the hearing, stating that the remaining accomplices still needed to be pursued. The court ordered the three thieves to be detained and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Major Fire at Dunlop Warehouse; Fire Started on the Fifth Floor and Spread to the Third Floor; The Second Floor and Ground Floor Were Also Half Destroyed <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Total Losses Estimated at 600,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The warehouse of the British Dunlop Rubber Tire Company, located at No. 89 Fuzhou Road, had a total of five floors. The ground floor was used by Dunlop to store tires and manufacturing materials. The second floor was rented by the Hengmao Transfer Company to store various warehoused goods. The third floor was rented by the Gongli Foreign Firm, Yizhong Mark, and F茂 Foreign Firm to store electrical materials and leather goods. The fourth and fifth floors were rented by Yifeng Changhao to store silk and cotton. The day before yesterday and yesterday were the Western Christmas holiday, so all office and warehouse staff in the warehouse were on vacation and out. It was not until the evening that they returned to the warehouse to rest. Unexpectedly, at about 3:30 AM yesterday morning, when the staff were sound asleep, a fire suddenly broke out in the pile of silk and cotton on the fifth floor of the Yifeng Changhao. Because no one noticed it at the time, it was allowed to spread. By the time the fire broke through the roof and was spotted by passers-by and patrolling police, who knocked on the door on the ground floor to call for help, it was too late to save it. The flames soared into the sky, and the red light shone everywhere. Moreover, the fifth floor was extremely high, and it was impossible to save it urgently. The fire department was immediately called to dispatch all fire trucks to rush to the scene to put out the fire. Some firefighters tried to go up from below, but the fourth and third floors had already been affected, and the thick smoke caused people to faint. Moreover, the warehouse doors were all locked, so it was impossible to know what the internal fire situation was like. There was no way to enter, so they changed their method, erected ladders, and watered from above and below. At the same time, they took defensive measures around the warehouse to prevent it from spreading. All the fire hydrants in the nearby area were connected with hoses, crisscrossing the ground, and water accumulated on the roads, forming small canals, and traffic was completely blocked. Looking back at the fire in the warehouse, it was still increasing. The flames were visible from the roof, like a hot pot. The fierceness of the burning was evident. At this time, the firefighters spared no effort to fight the fire bravely. After more than four hours of continuous watering, the fire was slightly reduced, but the embers were not exhausted, and it still flared up here and there. It was not until about 10:00 AM that the fire was completely extinguished. As a result, the third, fourth, and fifth floors were completely destroyed, and the second floor and the ground floor were also half burned. The total loss was as high as 600,000 yuan. However, the various firms in the warehouse had fire insurance. As for the cause of the fire, it is difficult to determine for a while. The police are investigating.</p>

<p>At 2:30 PM on December 23rd, Xu Jujin, a cashier from the accounting office of the Railway Bureau, was dispatched to carry more than 4,200 yuan in cash and more than 2,200 yuan in bank checks to the engineering office to pay the December salaries. When passing through the corridor on the upper floor of the bureau, two people, one in a long gown and one in a short coat, each holding a short knife, suddenly dragged Xu Jujin to outside the corridor door, threatened him to keep quiet, and tied his neck, hands, and feet tightly with rope. They then robbed the money and the bag containing the money and fled. When Mr. Xu struggled to untie the rope and chased downstairs, the thieves had already fled and disappeared. The bureau was informed and immediately reported to the police and strictly pursued them. On one hand, the bank was notified to stop payment of the checks.

<p>In West Shanghai, at number 13 Ganjiazhai, Chenjiadu, north of Zhoujiaqiao Creek, resided Gan A'er, a 35-year-old native of Shanghai who made a living by farming. At around 6 PM last night, four robbers suddenly arrived. Two were armed with handguns and broke down the door. The Gan family was terrified and dared not make a sound. They were robbed of six silver dollars and twenty or thirty pieces of cloth and clothing. As the robbers, each with their loot, were about to leave, Qian Jinquan, a 21-year-old Shanghai resident living at number 7 next door, caught a glimpse of them and shouted "Catch the thieves!" at the door. In their desperation, the robbers fired several shots, two of which hit Qian in the abdomen and next to his left breast, piercing his intestines and internal organs. He immediately collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely, and died on the spot. Seeing the enormity of their crime, the robbers immediately fled north, passing through Chenjiazhai, the northern Xin Cemetery, and behind the Zhang Family Ancestral Hall. There, they encountered the deceased's father, Qian Amao, 43 years old, who was returning from his work at the Zhaofeng Garden. Seeing the robbers with guns coming from the direction of Ganjiazhai, he suspected they were robbers and shouted "Robbers!" In the chaos of their escape, the robbers immediately turned and fired, hitting Qian in the chest. He immediately fell into a pool of blood. At that time, members of the Second Team of the Pusong District Defense Corps were patrolling and heard the gunshots. They immediately searched in all directions and captured one of the escaping robbers, Zhu Afu, near the Zhang Family Ancestral Hall. Meanwhile, the injured Qian Amao was transported by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, but he died of his injuries before reaching the hospital. According to the captured robber Zhu Afu, 22 years old and a native of Huzhou, he and his accomplices Zhou Rongqing (aka Wang Dexiu), Wu Aliul, and Ying Gongqing, etc., lived together at number 12 Chongde Lane, Weihaiwei Road. He confessed that on the 24th at around 5 PM, they gathered at a certain beef restaurant next to the Hongfei Theater in Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, and conspired to commit robbery in Chenjiadu. The team immediately sent the captured robber Zhu Afu to the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau. The detective team leader Liang Yu, Huang Zhonghe, squad leaders Liu Bingyuan and Liu Shaoqing, and detectives Zhang Zuoxian and Zhang Diling, together with the concession police, searched the address but found nothing. They also went to number 11 Wuxing Lane, Malang Road, and arrested a suspected female offender, Wu, 22 years old, who stated she used to work as a maid. Her husband's name was Zhou Rongqing, who also used to work but was now unemployed and she did not know what he was doing outside. She said that a friend of her husband had come to visit and they had gone out together but had not yet returned. The team is currently strictly searching for the escaping robbers. Meanwhile, the local Bao Zhang has reported the case to the Shanghai Local Court to inspect the bodies of Qian Amao and Qian Jinquan, father and son, who were robbed and murdered.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Gods and Buddhas, Puppets All in One Place: Second Sister Treats Illnesses and Collects Money, Actually Claiming Three Gods Take Turns Possessing Her and Displaying Miraculous Powers; Superstitious Women Are Bewildered and Deceived Out of a Lot of Money <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>—Zhang Chengda Discovers the Secret and Files a Lawsuit—</p>
<p>Zhu Guangbu, a native of Wuxi, is 27 years old, and his wife, Zhou Suyang, also known as Second Sister, is 32 years old. They live together at number 1308, Liuhe Lane, Roberts Road in West Shanghai. Their home has a shrine with statues of gods and Buddhas, arranged in a very imposing fashion. All the deities commonly worshipped, such as Guanyin, Jigong, and Lu Zu, are displayed. In addition, there are the so-called Grand Mother, Second Father, and Third Lord, three evil gods summoned from Shangfang, Suzhou, who specialize in treating illnesses. Second Sister is skilled in socializing,</p>
<p>and her footprints can be found in the homes of officials, gentry, and wealthy people. Thus, she is able to take the opportunity to wag her tongue and make exaggerated claims, declaring that these three gods take turns possessing her every evening, each displaying miraculous powers. This woman is not only eloquent but also proficient in various local dialects. When she speaks with a soft Wu accent, she claims to be possessed by the "Grand Mother." Then she switches to Mandarin, saying that "Third Lord" has arrived. Finally, she changes to a stuttering tone, indicating that "Second Father" has descended. Ordinary superstitious women are all bewitched by the appearances of these demons and monsters, and flock to her home to pray, or</p>
<p>beg for divine healing. Zhu and Zhou respond according to the individual, either giving them talismans to suppress evil spirits, or providing incense ash to be used as a remedy. If the patient does not improve after taking it, they blame the person for not being sincere. If a patient suddenly recovers, they boast of their god's omnipotence. Therefore, since the establishment of the incense hall, countless people have been fooled and deceived out of money, and Zhu's pockets have been filled daily. This summer, a fellow villager named Zhang Chengda, whose child was ill, was misled by rumors and also went to Zhu's home to seek divine treatment. At first,</p>
<p>the expenses were minimal. After several visits, Second Sister became familiar with the Zhang couple, and their interactions became increasingly intimate. Later, she realized that Zhang was gullible and began to use manipulative tricks. Whenever she went to Zhang's home, she would say that his residence was unlucky, his wife was jinxed, and his son had heavy evil influences. If he did not seek a remedy urgently, there was a risk of death. Zhang, wanting to protect the lives of his wife and children, reluctantly sacrificed money. There were six instances where he was cheated out of one hundred and ten dollars each, and another five hundred and six dollars. However,</p>
<p>Zhu and his wife were still not satisfied with their greed. They claimed that the incense hall was too small and needed to be expanded, and asked Zhang to donate money. Zhang, who was originally a sample maker, agreed to draw construction plans and undertake the painting work after the incense hall was completed. The amount of money he helped with, whether it was for incense or to buy silver ingots, was even harder to count. It was not until recently that Zhang discovered the inside story of Zhu and Second Sister using gods and Buddhas to defraud people. He believed that if he continued to endure this, the harm would be endless, so he hired a lawyer and filed a</p>
<p>criminal self-accusation of fraud and intimidation against Zhu Guangbu and Second Sister in the First Special District Local Court. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang opened the court to summon and interrogate them. The defendant, Second Sister, was dressed in splendid clothes, looking like a noblewoman, while Zhu Guangbu argued that his family worshipped Buddha and respected gods, which was true, but they did not use it to collect money. He also claimed that he had a considerable amount of property, and that he had disagreements with the plaintiff because of stock market transactions, and that he was now being falsely accused out of spite. He also hired three lawyers to represent him. After the court finished questioning, it announced that the verdict would be announced next Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 7:00 PM, the body of an unidentified man was discovered, chopped to death, at Xietu Road, on the corner of Xieqiao Jumen Road. There were six or seven cuts to the head, the blood and flesh were a gruesome mess, a truly horrifying sight. The right hand had been hacked off and lay nearby. The man was approximately forty years old, his head facing north and his feet facing south. He was wearing a gray cotton-padded robe and a black rubber raincoat. (The spot was about two hundred paces from the No. 14 post). At the time, the weather was rainy and the light was dim, with few pedestrians, so no one had noticed. Later, Zhang Hongji, a resident of number 277 Xietu Road, caught a glimpse of it and reported it to the police on duty at the post, who in turn reported it to the Ximen Public Security Bureau. They then summoned the local Bao Zhang and requested the court to examine the scene, and ordered the detective squad to strictly apprehend the culprit and bring them to justice. At the time, residents in the area, seeing the body lying in a pool of blood, intended to report it to the ambulance, but mistakenly called the Fire Brigade, causing fire brigades from various districts to drive to the scene one after another. Only when they arrived did they learn what had happened, and they then returned in succession.</p>

<p>Zhu Yaoting, the Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration, has served as the Director of the Hangzhou Municipal Engineering Bureau, the Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and other positions.

<p>The owner of the Russian bakery and confectionery store opened by a Russian, Beli Qiqiang (transliteration), 48 years old, at number 234-236, Albert Road in the French Concession, because his hired Russian partner, Seyi Mianuofu (transliteration), had indecent behavior towards his two daughters, Lala (transliteration), 9 years old, and Weiliang (transliteration), 6 years old.

Beli could not contain his anger for a moment, and stabbed Seyi to death with a beef knife. Afterwards, Beli surrendered to the French Police Station.

<p>In order to develop its business, reduce industrial production costs, and alleviate the burden on citizens, so as to promote the prosperity of the market, the Xianghu Men Electric Company in the Yinxiang District of this city previously reduced electricity prices once. It is now heard that the company, after a board meeting, has decided to further reduce all electricity and heating prices, except for lighting, and also change the billing system. This has been submitted to the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau and forwarded to the Municipal Government for approval by the Construction Committee, and is scheduled to be implemented in January of the 25th year. The various prices obtained are listed below for public information: Lighting: For monthly electricity usage below 500 degrees, 18 cents per degree in national currency; for usage exceeding 500 degrees but below 1,000 degrees, 16 cents per degree for the excess; for usage exceeding 1,000 degrees but below 3,000 degrees, 14 cents per degree for the excess; for usage exceeding 3,000 degrees but below 5,000 degrees, 10 cents per degree for the excess; for usage exceeding 5,000 degrees but below 15,000 degrees, 7 cents per degree for the excess; for usage exceeding 15,000 degrees, 6 cents per degree for the excess.

<p>2. Maoxin Flour Mill - This factory is divided into factories 1, 2, 3, and 4. The first three factories are located in Wuxi, while the last factory is located in Jinan. The head office is located at 421 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai. All are operated by Rong Zongjing and are unlimited liability companies with a total capital of 1.45 million yuan. The equipment of each factory is listed below: (A) Factories 1 and 3 have a total of 36 flour machines, 1,200 horsepower of prime mover, a base covering 20 mu, and worker dormitories built outside the factory, with approximately 250 workers. (B) Factory 2 has 24 flour machines, 750 horsepower of prime mover, and more than 170 workers. (C) Factory 4 has 12 flour machines, 450 horsepower of prime mover, and a factory base covering 16 mu. Statistics show that the four factories produce 1.2 million bags of flour annually. The sales market is widest in Tianjin domestically, and there are also sales in Southeast Asia. Last year's profit was 280,000 yuan.</p>
<p>3. Fuxin Flour Mill - This factory is divided into eight factories. Factory 4 was closed four years ago, and Factory 5, located in Hankou, is also currently closed. The establishment year, address, capital, and other items of factories 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 are listed below:</p>
<p>The Fuxin factories are also operated by Rong Zongjing, and the Wang Yuqing and Wang Yaochen brothers are also major shareholders. It is an important town in China's flour industry, and the amount of its output is closely related to the market. The factory's products originally had the brands Baoxing, Fushou, and Fisherman, etc. Later, because their sales were not as smooth as "Warship", they were all changed to "Warship". The sales market is mainly in Tianjin, along the Yangtze River, coastal provinces, and Southeast Asia, and there are also large sales volumes. In the past, when the factory's business was booming, it could sell more than 20 million bags of flour annually. In recent years, due to the impact of the loss of the Northeast, the average has been reduced to about 17 million bags. Last year, the price of flour rose slightly, and the profit was greater. For example, the profits of factories 1, 3, 6, and 7 reached 1.5 million yuan. During nine days this year, Fuxin Factory 1 and other branch factories temporarily stopped work for about a month due to the lack of raw materials because inland wheat could not be continuously transported. It was not until the previous month that work was resumed.</p>
<p>In addition to Fufeng and Fuxin, there are also many flour mills in this city, such as Lida on Efeisi Road and Shenda on Jichang Street in Nanshi, but because they are smaller in scale, they will not be discussed here.</p>
<h3 id="e153">General Situation of the Flour Industry in Shanghai (Continued) (Part 7 of the General Situation of Industry and Commerce in Shanghai) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit Institute</p>
<p>3. Raw Materials for the Flour Industry - Wheat</p>
<p>The raw material for the flour industry is wheat. The main wheat-producing areas in my country are in the Yellow River provinces. In recent years, due to the invasion of natural disasters and man-made disasters, the amount of harvest has been greatly reduced. According to the survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, the national wheat production was 41,112,000 dan in the 21st year, 39,620,000 dan in the 22nd year, and 43,518,000 dan in the 23rd year. Although last year was slightly higher than in the previous two years, it still only accounted for 68% of the full harvest year. My country is originally an agricultural country, and according to the wheat harvest alone, there is no need to rely on foreign countries. However, flour factories in Shanghai sometimes also have to purchase foreign wheat, which is because domestic production is insufficient. In addition, inconvenient domestic transportation and the inability of wheat from distant places to arrive in Shanghai in time are also a major reason. According to customs statistics, since the 12th year of the Republic of China, wheat has been in deficit every year. The deficit numbers for the past three years and the first three quarters of this year are listed below for reference: (Unit: Customs Gold)</p>
<p>National Shanghai Port</p>
<p>Year 21 41,543,135 31,226,816</p>
<p>Year 22 45,062,543 35,942,749</p>
<p>Year 23 15,659,026 14,013,722</p>
<p>First three quarters of this year 17,025,245 Not detailed</p>
<p>The countries importing wheat are mostly the United States, followed by Canada and Australia. However, because the imported price of this kind of imported wheat is sometimes more expensive, it is not very cost-effective for Shanghai factories to purchase it for flour production. Therefore, whenever there is a domestic shortfall and transportation is not profitable, Shanghai factories still cannot avoid the pain of stopping work. According to a certain newspaper on September 25 of this year, Fuxin Factory 1 stopped manufacturing due to the reduced source of inland wheat and the lack of raw materials. Other factories such as Fuxin Factory 8 and Lida were also at risk of stopping work at that time. However, once ethnic flour manufacturers stop work, the opportunity for imported flour to enter will inevitably increase even more, which is something that we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>The flour-producing ability of wheat varies according to its type. Generally speaking, American wheat can produce 767 catties of flour and 22 catties of bran per 100 catties of raw wheat, white wheat can produce 745 catties of flour and 22 catties of bran, and Australian red wheat can produce 756 catties of flour and 23 catties of bran. The wheat produced in this country is of poor quality, and each 100 catties can only produce 70 catties of flour and 234 catties of bran. Bran, the by-product of the flour milling industry, was only used to feed livestock in the past, and its sales were limited to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Recently, the Japanese have made good use of it to make gluten and seasoning foods, increasing its utility and gradually widening its sales, but it is still mostly purchased by the Japanese.</p>
<p>American wheat is divided into white-skinned and purple-skinned types, while Australian wheat is red-skinned, and domestic wheat is yellow-skinned, and their qualities also vary. White-skinned wheat is loose in texture and thin in skin, and the flour produced is clean and white, but lacks gluten. Purple-skinned wheat is solid and small, the flour color is slightly inferior, but the gluten is stronger. Red-skinned wheat is solid and thick-skinned, and the flour color is the same as that of purple-skinned wheat. Yellow-skinned wheat is solid and small, the flour produced is shiny and not inferior to the purple and red types, and the gluten is the strongest, accounting for about 40-50%, while other American, Australian and Cambodian wheat only accounts for about 40%. As for the impurities contained, the red and purple types have the least, about 2 catties, the white wheat is the next, about 4 catties, and the domestic wheat is the most mixed, up to 6 catties. This is the biggest shortcoming of domestic wheat. If we can find a way to improve it in the future, then the raw materials for flour production can be self-sufficient.</p>
<p>4. Rise and fall of wheat prices and flour prices</p>
<p>In recent years, wheat and flour prices in Shanghai have fluctuated from time to time. Wheat prices were slightly higher in the 21st year, lower in the 22nd year, and slightly rebounded last year. The first few months of this year were not much different from the second half of last year, but the upward trend was more intense after the implementation of the new currency policy. The rise and fall of flour prices are generally consistent with wheat, and there is no obvious distance between yarn and flowers. The following table is based on the statistics listed in the monthly Central Bank Monthly to facilitate the search:</p>
<p>Shanghai wheat market and flour market statistics table for the past four years</p>

<p>November 3.92 3.39 3.85 ……</p>
<p>December 4.10 3.54 3.96 ……</p>
<p>In addition, the most important issue is how the new monetary system promotes flour market prices. According to the Shanghai Price Index compiled by the National Tariff Committee, the increase in October and November was quite rapid. Please refer to the table below:</p>
<p>Year 20 Year 22 Year 23 Year 24</p>
<p>2.603 2.742 2.150 2.457</p>
<p>…… 2.533 2.150 2.412</p>
<p>…… 2.469 2.082 2.361</p>
<p>…… 2.431 2.056 2.424</p>
<p>…… 2.410 1.979 2.467</p>
<p>2.636 2.360 2.049 2.354</p>
<p>2.558 2.309 2.247 2.358</p>
<p>2.680 2.254 2.616 2.385</p>
<p>2.677 2.292 2.339 2.457</p>
<p>2.586 2.110 2.279 2.720</p>
<p>2.533 2.148 2.410 ……</p>
<p>2.648 2.232 2.489 ……</p>
<p>Note: Unit: yuan, wheat is calculated in 100 catties, flour is calculated in bags (49 pounds).</p>
<p>The Shanghai flour market price this year increased from 2.385 yuan in August to 2.457 yuan in September, and further increased to 2.72 yuan in October, a difference of about 4 jiao. Rong Zongjing, a giant in the flour industry, has made a detailed explanation of the reasons and their impact, which is quoted below:</p>
<p>"In recent months, due to the impact of floods in various provinces, the raw material of wheat has been reduced, and foreign raw cotton is also too expensive and the cost is too high, which is not very cost-effective. In addition, the European Italian and Afghan situation is very tense, and no country has exports. Therefore, the price of flour in our country is rising step by step. The factory I operate will be completely closed by the end of this month due to lack of raw materials. Flour is an indispensable food for the people, and such a high price is a trivial matter for the national livelihood.</p>
<p>Flour brand October 15 November 15</p>
<p>Green Bingtuan brand 2.705 2.983</p>
<p>Old Car brand 2.705 2.983</p>
<p>Double Horse brand 2.675 2.950</p>
<p>Golden Bell brand 2.650 2.925</p>
<p>Red Sun Rising brand 2.700 2.975</p>
<p>Note: The price of flour is calculated per bag, in yuan.</p>
<p>Such a rise in flour prices may be of considerable benefit to manufacturers, but it may cause considerable difficulties for the general public. Therefore, on the one hand, we must pay attention to the implementation of the new currency policy, and at the same time, we must also take into account how to adjust the high prices. (End)</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>They started off really well, but after an hour they gradually became bored and impatient with being confined indoors, and longed to be able to run outside. They heard the sounds from the main hall and wondered how interesting it must be there. Even the small bedroom held appeal; if they could imagine the curtains as military tents, there would be plenty to play with. The open window directly enticed them, because they couldn't go to the window to look out. The world outside felt so beautiful, and they privately thought, how could anyone say it was boring? Nan yearned to run a lap around the lawn. Rob suddenly remembered that he hadn't fed the dog that day, and wondered how poor Pluto was doing. They watched the clock, Nan dividing the hours into minutes, meticulously. Rob practiced telling time, from eight o'clock to one o'clock; he would never forget it. It was truly difficult, smelling the aroma of the food and knowing there was pearl rice with lentils, as well as blackberry pudding, yet they couldn't go to the table to eat their fill. When the maid, Annie, went to arrange the dishes, they wished they could transform themselves to see what meats there were. Poon even offered to help her make the beds if she would put extra sauce on her pudding.</p>
<p>When the students came out after their lessons, they saw the two children wrestling with the riding tack, like a pair of restless little ponies. They saw the results of last night's adventure and not only found it amusing but also learned quite a few lessons.</p>
<p>Wartime Education Work Plan</p>
<p>By the Colleagues of the Education Research Institute of Sun Yat-sen University</p>
<p>I. Wartime Work Plan for Educational Administration, II. Wartime Work Plan for Universities, III. Wartime Work Plan for High Schools, IV. Wartime Work Plan for Junior High Schools, V. Wartime Work Plan for Elementary Schools, VI. Wartime Work Plan for Civic Schools,</p>
<p>I. Wartime Work Plan for Educational Administration</p>
<p>A. Basic Principles: 1. Wartime work organization should be able to take care of both vertical and horizontal aspects. Vertically, the work at all levels—national, provincial, county, city, township, and school—should correspond with each other. Horizontally, the activities among educational administrative organs and schools, among schools, and among classes in the same area should be coordinated with each other. 2. All practical wartime activities should have strict procedures, that is, recognizing needs, then implementing training. Work must be carried out after training.</p>
<p>3. All faculty, staff, students, and workers of each school should participate. In addition to general work, each should focus on certain types of training according to their abilities, to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. After receiving training themselves, they should also teach others.</p>
<p>4. Wartime education work should strive for centralized authority internally and cooperation externally.</p>
<p>B. Organizational System: 1. In order to ensure that the wartime work organization can take care of both vertical and horizontal aspects, each province, county, and city nationwide should establish a central agency as the hub of wartime education work, without the need for various small organizations. During periods of military emergency, all educational personnel in the province must be under the command of the provincial central agency. 2. The wartime work organization for education in the province will have the Provincial Wartime Education Work Committee as the highest authority, the County/City Wartime Education Work Committee as the central organization, and the School Wartime Work Committee as the basic organization.</p>
<p>3. The Provincial Wartime Education Work Committee shall be jointly organized by the Provincial Department of Education, the County/City Education Bureau (or Section), universities, middle schools, and public education centers. It shall consist of fifteen members, with the Director of the Provincial Department of Education and the President of the National University as ex-officio members. Other members shall be appointed from university presidents, experts, and designated County/City Education Bureau Directors (or Section Chiefs), middle and elementary school principals, and directors of provincial public education centers.</p>
<p>4. The County/City Wartime Education Work Committee shall be jointly organized by the County/City Education Bureau (or Section), middle and elementary schools, public education centers, and civic schools. It shall consist of nine members, with the County/City Education Bureau Director (or Section Chief) and the Principal of the Provincial Middle School as ex-officio members. Other members shall be appointed from experts and other middle school principals, and designated elementary school principals, public education center directors, and civic school principals.</p>
<p>5. The regulations for middle schools also apply to normal schools and vocational schools. 6. The Provincial Committee is a parallel agency to the Provincial Department of Education and universities, and the County/City Committee is a parallel agency to the local Education Bureau (or Section).</p>
<p>7. The organizational chart for each level is as follows:</p>
<p>8. The following departments shall be established under the Provincial/County (City) Wartime Work Committees: Personnel Registration Department, Needs Investigation Department, Skills Training Department, Curriculum Guidance Department, Social Work Department.</p>
<p>9. The task of the Personnel Registration Department is to register various technical talents and untrained personnel, and it shall have sections for military personnel, medical personnel, agricultural personnel, industrial personnel, and general personnel.</p>
<p>10. The task of the Needs Investigation Department is to manage the investigation of wartime needs in various aspects, and it shall have sections for population survey, occupational survey, food survey, daily necessities survey, military raw materials survey, and transportation survey.</p>
<p>11. The task of the Skills Training Department is to manage the training of various personnel during wartime, and it shall have sections for military training, scouting training, first aid training, defense training, fire fighting training, military supplies manufacturing, transportation engineering, and food production increase. 12. The task of the Curriculum Guidance Department is to plan and guide the progress of schoolwork during wartime, and it shall have sections for literature, history and geography, science, agriculture, and industry.</p>
<p>13. The task of the Social Work Department is to convey the wartime knowledge and skills obtained by the committee to the public and to manage matters related to the public. It shall have sections for publicity, introduction, fundraising, relief, and consolation. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e160">The Impact of the 1935-36 Basketball Rules on Basketball Training (Continued) <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Authored by Ruby of the United States, Translated by Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>The third diagram shows another famous offensive method, which has become ineffective due to the implementation of the new three-second rule. Number 4 passes to Number 1, Number 1 passes back to Number 4, Number 4 passes to Number 2, and Number 1 passes back to Number 4. Number 4 feints a drive and a long shot each time he advances, but according to this new rule, Number 1 only has time to receive the ball and pass it to Number 4 once.</p>
<p>Many teams have switched to the double pivot offense, especially when a team has one tall player and three short, agile players who are good at long shots. The fourth diagram shows a double pivot offense. This formation can be varied in several ways. This type of offense avoids violating the one-second rule. However, since there are only three players attacking in the front, the defense against players far from the ball can be slightly relaxed, as shown by the movement of players CA in Figure 4.</p>
<p>In the western Midwest of the United States, there is a trend toward the offensive formation shown in Figure 5. Because the area in front of the basket is open, players can break into that area to shoot, thereby allowing a team to avoid violating the two-second rule. The two points of many zone defenses are within the free throw area. The adoption of zone defenses will inevitably be more common than in the past. This is a natural trend, no doubt.</p>
<p>Due to requests from several parties, the National Basketball Rules Committee has partially approved the requests in the Pacific coastal area and has eliminated the center jump. The original text is as follows: "After a free throw is made due to a personal foul, the ball must be thrown in by the team that was fouled from any point outside the end line of the court. When the ball is thrown into the court, the time is restarted. At this time, the referee does not need to take the ball and hand it over." (Note 3)</p>
<p>The implementation of this rule will likely eliminate 5,000 percent of the previous center jump. Therefore, coaches cannot spend as much time as they used to practicing center court offensive formations, but will instead use that time to train how to quickly attack after a free throw is made due to a personal foul. Suppose after Team A makes a free throw due to a personal foul, Team B's guard or center quickly holds the ball and stands outside the end line of the court and throws it to his teammate's forward for a quick counterattack. This counterattack may or may not achieve special results, but at least it can cause Team A's players to quickly retreat to defense out of concern, so that they have less chance of getting the ball when their shot is missed.</p>
<p>Team B's quick counterattack can be delayed by Team A retrieving the ball after the free throw is made. How much this delay will be is unknown until the official new rules are released this season. However, according to situation 298 in the book "The Scenarios of the Basketball Game," "After Team A's number 1 completes the free throw, the ball is awarded to Team B to throw in from the end line. However, because Team A wants enough time to form its defensive formation, Team A's number 1 hits the ball under the seat. Rule—The referee has the right to declare a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct."</p>
<p>(Chapter 15, Article 1, Example 4)</p>
<p>Over the years, many coaches have felt that when a player is fouled during a legitimate shot, the player should have the right to refuse the penalty. However, such a rule would be extremely difficult to implement. The rules for 1935-36 clearly state that such shots should be counted. However, from the moment of the foul until the shot is made, the shooter's movement must be continuous. If he makes any new movement after the whistle, the shot will not be counted. Therefore, from the coach's point of view, this change will change the tactics of the game.</p>
<p>One of the smartest changes in the new rules is that "dribbling a ball that is not stable and dribbling it continuously shall not be considered dribbling," and "When a player taps the ball in the air once or several times to prevent other players from contesting it, the dribbling action shall not be considered to have started." In the past, because of this old rule, the game was often slow due to the obstruction of agile defenses. This new rule will make the game more rapid.</p>
<p>The interruption in the circle of the free throw area will be extended into a complete circle, so that when the ball is jumped on the free throw line, the circle becomes a confining circle. In order to avoid the frequent congestion, all players except the jumpers must stand outside the circle until the ball is tapped.</p>
<p>This rule will make the referee's job easier. Therefore, referees will carry the ball into this area and throw it more often than before, so coaches will train fixed jump ball scoring methods in this area, which is a smart move.</p>
<p>The new rules also clarify the penalties for violating the center jump. Another new rule states that when a substitute reports to the referee and scorekeeper, he must provide his number, position, and the number of his opponent, if possible.</p>
<p>Also, there must be a fifteen-minute rest period between the two twenty-minute halves of the game, instead of ten minutes. This change will allow coaches to find ways to provide adequate skill demonstrations during the break to help entertain the audience.</p>
<p>Although there are many other minor changes, they will have very little impact on the training plan of coaches before the start of this season. (Note 1) (Note 3) Outline of Changes to the 1935-36 Basketball Rules</p>

<p>Yesterday was Christmas Day, and there was a grand charity football game, bringing together the elite of Chinese and Western football in Shanghai in one venue, so that the audience could feast their eyes and also help the poor. The intention was very good, but the weather did not cooperate. It had been drizzling since the evening before yesterday, and it still had not cleared up by yesterday afternoon. The field was exceptionally muddy, causing the great football game to be suspended. The Shanghai telephone was busy non-stop, which shows that there is no shortage of charitable people in Shanghai. In addition to the charity game yesterday, there were also three games in the Zilin Cup, one game each in Western League Groups C and D, and two games in Group E, all of which were suspended due to rain.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Thoughts on Giving Gifts: Before and After <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Before giving a gift, one must consider: Who is the gift for? Why give the gift? What gift to give? Where to buy the gift? How much of the gift to buy? Will the recipient find this gift useful? Will they like it? Can I afford it? These many questions swirl in the mind of the host or hostess, and it takes quite some time to decide.</p>
<p>The recipient of the gift is an emotional being, so one must first consider the other person's perspective. If you casually grab some useless items, shifting them from one place to another, the gift often travels from house A to B, C, D, and E, eventually returning to house A. Giving gifts is meant to build relationships, but this will only upset people. It is better not to give at all. Nowadays, everyone likes domestic goods. If I insist on giving foreign goods as gifts, I will not only be disliked but also despised. The strength of friendships lies in spirit, not in material things. If one does not consider one's financial ability and insists on showing off, giving a very expensive gift will make the recipient uneasy and suspicious. It is also useless and harmful. Psychology is recognized as a specialized field, but every class should study it. Giving gifts requires studying the recipient's psychology. It is foolish or stupid to give gifts without considering the recipient's psychology. After giving a gift, the recipient must reciprocate. There is a common saying, "It is disrespectful to refuse, but shameful to accept." Is it better to accept or decline a gift? That is the question. It is fine to accept a gift from someone close. It is reasonable to decline a gift from someone you are not close to. However, if someone sends a useless foreign product, it can be returned directly, and they can be given a lecture. If the gift-giver has another purpose or objective, it is shameful to accept and appropriate to decline. The ancients said, "A thin gift is fine for a strong friendship; true feelings do not require formalities." These are indeed profound words.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Let Me Talk About Giving Gifts <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>I read the previous issue of the National Goods Weekly, issue 145, from the 19th of this month, titled "New Year's Gift Special," and I am sure there will be another issue. Therefore, I will briefly state my opinions on giving gifts as follows: Mr. Yang An said, "Giving gifts is not about thickness or thinness, but about suitability; it is not about quantity, but about need." These are indeed profound words. I have always been most afraid of giving gifts. Useless items only waste money for the giver, and the recipient has no use for them. According to the principle of reciprocity, in a few days, the recipient becomes the giver and also wants to buy a gift in return. The giver becomes the recipient and also feels that it is unnecessary. Both parties suffer. Therefore, after I got married in the Republic of China era, I took my family to Jingkou three days in advance and informed my relatives and friends not to send gifts, or I would not reciprocate at all. As a result, my cousin Wang Zhefu still sent soy sauce duck and other dishes. I honestly did not stand on ceremony and did not buy a gift in return at the end of the year, which saved me a lot of trouble. In recent years, although friends in Shanghai have occasionally sent me gifts, I have never reciprocated. However, the gifts that people have sent me that I often remember and never forget include the following gentlemen: In the winter of the tenth year, when I was in mourning for my mother, Mr. Shen Jiucheng gave me a free flannel cotton robe, item 212, from the Sanyou Industrial Company. That year, because I had mourning clothes, I did not wear a silk-faced fur robe, but wore this garment through the winter. During the January 28th Incident the following year, after the 19th Route Army retreated to Kunshan, Suzhou was frequently alarmed. I detoured back to Suzhou to pick up my family. Because the Beijing-Shanghai Road was cut off early, I planned to take a boat to Jiaxing and then change to the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Shen. The passengers were crowded. The boat was docked in the middle of the river at the Shantang Gate. I boarded the boat in the middle of the night, lost my footing, and fell into the river. Because the garment had a lot of cotton and floated, I was not in danger. Unexpectedly, it saved my life. In the winter of the year before last, Mr. Fang Jiange gave me two enamel basins with a Standing Crane brand and a pair of tea trays and two spittoons produced by the China Enamel Factory. I took them to Suzhou for home use. The colors were beautiful, the styles were ingenious, and they were durable. Every time I returned to Suzhou to wash and drink tea, seeing these items made me think of Mr. Fang's kindness. This spring, Mr. Xu Xiaochu and I were invited by Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Pei Yunqing to tour Shaoxing. On the way back, we stayed in Hangzhou for three days. It rained every day. Mr. Xu bought a paper umbrella and gave it to me. I held this umbrella every day and enjoyed the Three Pools and Six Bridges. The interest was very strong and quite useful. During the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, my wife Sun Wuqi and I joined the Yousheng Travel Group and went to Jiaxing to visit the famous sites of Yanyu Tower, Luofan Pavilion, and Three Pagoda Temple. The weather was extremely hot in the morning, but suddenly very cold in the afternoon. The temperature difference was more than 30 degrees. I was only wearing a long Indian silk shirt, and I was very cold. Fortunately, Mr. Ren Shigang gave me a goose-brand cotton undershirt made by the Wuhe Weaving Factory, which allowed me to resist the cold and not be frozen. This fall, Mr. Yuan Hesong gave me two cans of Sanhe pickles, which I brought to my residence in Suzhou. It happened that my wife Songru was postpartum and disliked fish and meat for being greasy and did not want to eat them. She regarded this item as a treasure when she saw it, ate it greedily, and praised it endlessly. Mr. Zhou Bangjun gave me a bakelite-covered thermos and a cigarette case and a cigarette tray, all made of bakelite, the other day. I took them back to my Suzhou residence. I bring rice to school in the bottle every day, and fill it with water for washing my face. The box and tray are placed in the living room as decorations. Guests will praise their exquisite style and suitability for daily use. The items given by the gentlemen above are all domestic goods; they are not very expensive, but they are quite practical, so I have not forgotten them to this day. It can be seen that giving gifts is really not about thickness or quantity. We should pay attention to the four words "suitable and needed."</p>
<h3 id="e169">Talking about New Year's Gifts <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Guan Tingzhen</p>
<p>We humans live in society and cannot avoid contact with others. Contact leads to emotional effects, and as a result, we cannot avoid giving gifts. This is the so-called principle of reciprocity. Giving gifts can be divided into two types. One type is giving gifts among relatives. The gifts given in this type are mostly determined by customs. However, they are generally a few fixed types, so there is no need to say more. The other type is giving gifts among friends. This can be further divided into gifts for adults and gifts for children (including relatives' children). The gifts given in this type initially have no fixed restrictions, but there is a considerable range. Generally speaking, gifts for adults tend to be about food. Gifts for children? Some are edible and some are for playing. What I want to talk about here is the issue of gifts for children, with an emphasis on toys. Children are rich in imitation. No matter what others do, they will eventually learn by watching. So, how can a person grow up like this? Just look at how he learned by watching when he was young. Shouldn't we pay special attention to gifts for children? European and American countries are very concerned about gifts for children. The gifts they give mostly contain scientific meaning, such as building blocks, trains, and airplanes. There are also complete sets of small craft tools, so that children can be instilled with scientific knowledge unconsciously while playing. I remember that I once went to a park in the concession and saw several foreign children racing boats in the pool. In a corner of the park, I saw another group digging in the ground with small shovels. Several of them were busy using small lead cylinders to draw water from the pool to inject into the holes to form a fake pool. This kind of game is common for them, so it is easy to become a scientific talent when they grow up. However, the ordinary games that Chinese children play are either gambling at candy stalls or fighting with others. They rarely use scientific toys to play, so when they grow up, they only become consumers in society. Currently, China is gradually paying attention to children's scientific games, and the number of factories manufacturing such toys is also increasing. Among them, the ones that produce the most and are priced the cheapest are the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and Kangyuan Can Factory. At the end of the year, they usually have special discounts on such toys, so that parents can buy them as gifts for children. In addition, there are many interesting books, such as children's daily newspapers, novels, and stories, which are also sold at discounted prices. They are very elegantly packaged and can also be purchased as gifts. As for sweets and other things to give to children, the Penglai Market in the South City and the National Goods Company on Nanjing Road, as well as the National Goods Market of the General Chamber of Commerce, have everything that can be purchased. If you need other special gifts that are not sold in these stores, you can directly inquire with the China National Goods Company, and they will definitely have a satisfactory answer. You must not buy foreign goods to replace them, because this is what foreigners are ashamed of.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Rational New Year's Gifts <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow, and the sun and moon pass like a shuttle. Time passes like flowing water. In an instant, the New Year of the Republic of China, 25th year, is about to arrive again. The swiftness of time truly evokes boundless emotions in us!</p>
<p>As this New Year is about to arrive but hasn't yet, we open the newspapers to see that there are many advertisements, mostly displaying the eye-catching characters "New Year's Gifts." At the same time, looking at the pedestrians in the streets and alleys, many of them are carrying New Year's gifts to give to their relatives and friends. Due to this feeling, I think it is indeed a necessary thing for Mr. Yang An, the editor of the *Shen Bao* National Products Weekly, to publish a special issue on New Year's gifts today. Because the matter of gift-giving, on the surface, seems like a trivial matter, but upon closer examination, there is much room for discussion and research value, isn't there? In my opinion, a rational New Year's gift should meet the following three principles:</p>
<p>A. National Products: Of course! This is undeniable. When the call to promote national products is sung as high as into the clouds, we should naturally purchase national products for all our daily needs. New Year's gift-giving is a form of social interaction between people, so how can it be an exception? Therefore, our first principle in purchasing New Year's gifts is to pay attention to whether they are our country's products. For all things that are national products, even if the price is slightly more expensive, we must grit our teeth and buy them. Conversely, for all products that are not national products, even if the price is very cheap, we must not buy them just because they are inexpensive. In this severe winter, if we can take genuine national products (such as country eggs) as New Year's gifts, they will definitely be welcomed, because these things are not only authentic but also great tonics for the winter season. Furthermore, they can also provide considerable help to the lives of farmers and villagers.</p>
<p>B. Necessary: When giving gifts, we must not only pay attention to whether they are our country's products, but also consider the needs of the recipient. An item that someone doesn't need, even if it's given, will still be put on a high shelf, not practically used. In other words, if we can gauge the other person's psychology, observe their needs, and send practical gifts, then it will definitely make people satisfied and receive great goodwill. To put it in a scholarly way: such a gift-giving method is precisely the "doing more with less" new gift philosophy!</p>
<p>C. Durable: In addition to the above two principles, lastly, I think the word "durable" is also a point that we should consider when giving New Year's gifts. Because if we give gifts only for the sake of appearance and not for substance, such gifts will lose their effectiveness after a short time, which is very uneconomical. Therefore, when we give New Year's gifts, in addition to all kinds of food, cosmetics, etc., for all practical things, we must pay attention to the condition of "durability." This is also a place that cannot be ignored when purchasing New Year's gifts.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Small Experiences in Gift Giving <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Pu Manbin</p>
<p>The male head of the household is busy with matters and can't attend to trivial things. This gift-giving problem, of course, falls within the scope of the housewife's responsibilities. I'll contribute some of my small gift-giving experiences from over the years. The gifts we give can be divided into four aspects: clothing, food, daily necessities, and toys. Food and toys are certainly welcomed by children, but they should also not hinder health or damage material resources. The toys and food that I usually give people are always hygienic and meaningful. Therefore, educational toys, such as those produced by Commercial Press, China National Products Co., Kang Yuan, and other factories, I am a regular customer. Health foods from Guanshengyuan are also frequently patronized. Recently, I happened to buy cloth at Sanyou Industrial Co., and learned that their glutinous rice flour, real honey, and the well-known West Lake lotus root powder are all excellent foods, especially suitable for health in winter. I bought them and gave them to relatives and friends, who all welcomed them very much. However, for many close and thrifty relatives and friends, I also have to put some effort into clothing materials. Wang's family has a boy, so I cut two pieces of Sanyou Liberty cloth uniforms and sent them to him, and he was very happy. Li's family has two young ladies, so I bought two lengths of Gengyun brocade and Guoguang呢fabric, produced by the National Products Company Hongxin, and they were so happy that they praised them endlessly. For Mrs. Zhou, I sent two cotton wool shirts from Wuhe, and she specially called to ask me where Wuhe was located. Then, thinking about daily necessities, Mrs. Lu has many children, so I sent her a pair of Lihe basins and a kerosene stove, which she gave to her two sons who were studying in middle school. Miss Zhu is about to get married, so I chose ten items from the top-rated products of the China Chemical Industry Society, Family Industry Society, and Yonghe Industrial Co., and used them as a small token of affection. Miss Zhang Meifang and my cousin Yang Jun were engaged, so I commissioned Yaguang Bakelite Factory to make one hundred tea boxes, each with five plum blossoms inlaid on the lid, called the Five Plum Blossoms of Joy. The day before yesterday, my child came back from school and said that many classmates don't brush their teeth, so I bought a dozen Yixin toothbrushes and asked her to distribute them to her friends. I unintentionally saw that Chen Alin's socks were torn. His mother passed away early, and his father is in another province, so I bought him two pairs of Changju socks and two pairs of May 30th wool socks and gave them to this poor child. Every summer, I must go to the Wuzhou Sanfang to buy many medicines and send them to relatives and friends in the countryside as essential medicines for the family in the summer. Sister-in-law Zhu washes clothes for her eight children all day long, so I sent her two dozen Invincible soaps. She said that she usually likes to use Guben soap and Invincible soap. A certain lady, a relative of mine, developed a nervous illness. One day, I heard Mr. Qi Fanniu lecturing on Mencius and unintentionally learned that Mabin from Sanyou Society is very effective, so I bought two yuan's worth and sent it to her to try, and now she is actually cured. People say that this gift of mine is priceless. I feel that giving people national products is very valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Talking About My Family's Gift-Giving <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Ju</p>
<p>Time really flies like a galloping horse, and in the blink of an eye, it's New Year again. In this upcoming New Year, because of following customs, many families give each other gifts. The so-called "reciprocity..." Every year there are bound to be some gift-giving activities, but when it comes to gift-giving, it is necessary to cater to the other person's preferences. Even if it is light and insignificant, it is still a token of human affection. As the ancient saying goes, "A goose feather sent from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the sentiment is heavy," that is a very good example.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about my family's gift-giving. Because my family has many relatives, most of whom live in other cities, once the end of the year and the beginning of the year arrive, some buy some gifts to visit and comfort us. But among the gifts they (or we) send, what I like best are those national product daily necessities, such as towels, bed sheets, clothing materials, etc., produced by Sanyou Industrial Co., and goose brand sanitary shirts, socks, velvet ropes, etc., from Wuhe Factory. I love to use them all, first, because they are purely national products, and we Chinese people should love Chinese goods, and second, because they are very durable. For example, the towels, Liberty cloth, printed sheets, etc., from Sanyou Society never fade in color, and the patterns are exquisite and unparalleled, and the uses are durable and long-lasting. But I have several relatives who, in order to curry favor, go to buy imported gifts to send me, but in fact, I don't welcome them. This shows their foreign-flattering mentality, but on the surface, because of human relations, I can't do anything about it. In reality, on the one hand, I politely decline, and on the other hand, I pick out a few national product gifts and send them to him (or her). This way, the gifts they send me must be national products.</p>
<p>When it comes to giving gifts, if there are children, it is best to place two kinds of edible gifts in the gifts. Now, the various candies of Guanshengyuan are very good—not inferior to imported goods. In the items I give away every year, I put one or two to show encouragement to the children's psychology of also using national products for food.</p>
<p>Then, I would like to advise the housewives of each family that when giving gifts, first, you must plan in advance what gifts each family sends, and what gifts each family wants to send. Then, you must make them more practical, mostly based on national products.</p>

<h3 id="e174">New Year's Gifts That Should Be Given <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Guanjun</p>
<p>Time passes so quickly. A very thick calendar has already been torn off, leaving only a few pages. The twenty-fifth year is about to end quickly, and the twenty-fifth year is about to follow quickly. At the end of this twenty-fourth year, we must all plan New Year's gifts to give to our relatives and friends. This is a matter that cannot be avoided every year!</p>
<p>In the many past New Years, the gifts we gave to relatives and friends were nothing more than sweets, ham, New Year's cake, cured meat, fresh fish, colored eggs, and other kinds of food. The forms of New Year's gifts given by various places to relatives and friends may be different, but the content is always similar. I think that the gifts given for the New Year should be some daily-use gifts, because there is a lot of food during the New Year. If we give food again, it would be too much.</p>
<p>I will write down the New Year's gifts that should be given one by one below, which can both change the bad habits of the past and promote our country's national products.</p>
<p>Native cloth is the best kind of gift to give to relatives and friends in the New Year. The color is very elegant, and the material is very strong. If you make this cloth into clothes and wear them on your body, it is very simple, and it can also show that you are a person who loves to use national products. This kind of native cloth can be purchased from Sanyou Society, Hongxin Cloth Factory, Shanghai Native Cloth Company, etc. The price is not expensive, it is really cheap and good.</p>
<p>Overshoes are also the best kind of gift to give to relatives and friends in the New Year. They can be worn when it rains, and they can also be worn when it is sunny, which is really killing two birds with one stone. There are many factories in Shanghai that manufacture this kind of product. Among them, the cheap and good ones are of course the Double Coin brand overshoes from the Greater China Rubber Factory. They are strong and durable, and the form is beautiful. Wearing them on your feet is comfortable and beautiful.</p>
<p>Basins are also the best kind of gift to give to relatives and friends in the New Year, and they are also a necessary utensil for our three meals a day. There are many manufacturers of basins: such as China One, Jiuxin, Zhufeng Enamel Factory, etc. Among these three, of course, the China Enamel Factory is the best, because the enamel on the basins they make is very thick, so they are very strong. The trademark is a standing crane.</p>
<p>The above three kinds of goods are the best kinds of gifts to give to relatives and friends in the New Year. I hope that people from all over the world will come to buy them, which can directly save unnecessary consumption and indirectly revive our country's national products. It kills two birds with one stone, why not do it?</p>
<h3 id="e175">Advise to Use National Product Gifts (Introduction) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>One year passes easily, and another year is coming. Ten thousand households put up peach charms to welcome the New Year. According to custom, every family exchanges festival gifts, with trays and loads of gifts being carried around in a chaotic manner. Some are food and drink, some are utensils, and some are decorations, clothing, and other odds and ends. The ancients said, "A goose feather sent from a thousand miles away," and giving gifts is indeed sincere. However, there are many gifts that are difficult to count, and giving them to others also requires effort. If you give gifts that don't fit the trend, people will certainly be dissatisfied. As the saying goes, everything should be considered carefully, so that you can be welcomed everywhere. Next year is the beginning of the National Products Year, and national products should be recognized first. It is only because everyone has a patriotic heart that giving people national products is appropriate. Moreover, many national products are novel and better than imported ones in terms of research and precision. Just look at the items displayed in the National Products Company, and every color is competing secretly. Maya silk, Samsung ointment, Sanyou towel, Wuhe shirts, and Yixin brushes, Zhonghua Factory for enamelware, and Invincible brand is made by family industries, Huafu hats have good styles, and Hongxin cloth is bright in color, Zhanghua's products are beautiful in woolen cloth, and Hwasun makes stoves and fans. Other national product manufacturers are difficult to enumerate, so choose and buy as you please, so as not to send money to foreigners. You must know that although gift-giving is limited, it is startling when calculated together. It is pitiful that my Chinese nation is weak, and the people are poor and miserable. How can we not wake up again at this moment? If we can encourage and strive with one heart and one mind, and advise to give national products as gifts, then the revival of China will be certain.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Sorrow of the Nation <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yixin</p>
<p>Recently, due to the constant invasion of foreign enemies, the Chinese nation has suffered the most serious persecution. But this is not the real sorrow of the nation. History is full of many examples proving that a nation can struggle up under heavy pressure. The real sorrow is that at the moment when the nation's survival is in danger, there is not a single intelligent, far-sighted person to point out the path to liberation; even more sorrowful is that on the eve of the nation's collapse, it cannot arouse any reaction in a vast nation.</p>
<p>I remember Hegel saying the following when Germany was invaded by Napoleon in the 19th century: "Only knowledge is the only savior. Only knowledge can prevent us from being as stupidly surprised as beasts when events come, and also prevent us from using quick wits to perfunctorily deal with the present moment..." Hegel's words are truly an imperishable truth. When a nation is oppressed, if it can know how to arm itself with its own weapons, then it can still resist. The failure of resistance is a matter of the relationship between the mutual strength of facts, which can be relied upon by our efforts. The most sorrowful thing is that there is no "armament" from the beginning—in other words, there is no correct and scientific knowledge of the historical era in which a nation is located and its path to liberation. Therefore, even if one wants to revolt, there is no self-confidence whatsoever; and even if one rises up to resist, it is at most a blind action of "dealing with the moment" without conviction. Moreover, generally speaking, resistance will not exist, because it requires vast national strength. Without a certain understanding and knowledge of the overall path to liberation, national strength cannot be gathered.</p>
<p>China's current situation is exactly like this. I think this is his sorrow. China is now experiencing a kind of event, and the entire nation is hanging in the air. Except for listening to the natural development of the situation, no one knows where he should go. It is not useful to merely know that a certain thing or a certain force is evil, is the enemy; it is also not useful to merely know how to resist. No one knows what kind of situation the development and internal structure of the Chinese nation have reached, and how these situations have the most complex mutual relationship with external forces. But these contain important keys. Any nation is surviving, and it internally contains huge power, but these potential forces are not always able to be launched by external forces, it has its own certain laws. Only those who know this law and follow this law can move the internal strength of this nation. A nation—if not the whole, at least the most advanced part—understands this law by itself, which means the existence of the awakened spirit of this nation. If a nation can never have such an awakened national spirit, then it is equal to forever judging its fate.</p>
<p>Chinese history is backward, but this is not the only evidence that can be used to prove that the Chinese national spirit and general knowledge must also be equally backward. Nineteenth-century Germany was considered a backward country in Europe, but precisely because of its backwardness, this nation was actively excited in spirit. "After the fifteenth century, all the knowledge work of Western Europe was tightly condensed within the German territory for decades, as if it wanted to exhaust every ounce of strength to remedy the failure of several centuries." Therefore, the national spirit of Germany in the nineteenth century had a rich source, which was ultimately one of the major prerequisites for its strength. Similarly, twentieth-century Russia was also the most backward country in Europe, but it was able to consciously strive for its own spiritual development. Before the first revolution in Russia, Russia itself had nearly a hundred years of cultural development, overcoming the remnants of its backwardness and barbarism. This had a great relationship with the prerequisite of experience needed to create the great historical event of 1917 and its own understanding. Therefore, to repeat, we can know from this that historical backwardness cannot prove that the national spirit must also follow backwardness. On the contrary, this is precisely the place that gives us room for spiritual activity. If we know how to work hard and have worked hard, our national spirit can have a new development and can proceed at an accelerated rate; otherwise, we will have the opposite result. This is precisely determined by our subjective efforts and awareness. Therefore, within a certain limit, a nation's ability to develop its spirit is the locomotive of the nation's own ability to develop.</p>
<p>China is backward, but why is our national spirit so undeveloped? This is precisely the shame and sorrow of the nation itself, which cannot be attributed to history. The most sorrowful thing is that people blindly regard the general spirit of the nation as unimportant, thinking that the development of the nation can occur without the development of the national spirit. These people consider themselves "progressives." They think that the gathering of national strength can be summoned at any time like a ghost. They do not understand the great relationship between the development of the national spirit and the development of the nation itself. They do not even want to understand what the backwardness and current situation of the national spirit are. In fact, they are simply ignorant.</p>
<p>Not knowing the importance of the development of the national spirit means not knowing that in order to liberate the entire nation, we must first fight to remove all the shackles that restrict the free development of the national spirit. In practice, this means abandoning one's own historical task of great importance in reality.</p>
<p>Now, I will only say for everyone the importance and urgency of removing all the shackles on the free development of the nation.</p>
<p>As we said above, the development of the national spirit is the locomotive of the nation's own development. However, the development of a nation's spirit in a country does not follow a smooth path. At that time, it is often restricted in its development by old historical and social barriers. This is especially true in backward countries. If we say that the national spirit of twenty-first-century Russia has reached a high point of development, then first, it will have gone through the opportunity to strive for the free development of the national spirit. Without the opportunity for free development, the national spirit will go in the direction of suffocation, not in the direction of development.</p>
<p>The Chinese national spirit now has a free and possible environment for development. No. It is subject to the shackles of thought and the historical legends of society. It has the same difficulties as other nations in their historical development. Because the so-called creation and development of modern nations comes from negating their past "Middle Ages." The "Middle Ages" of each nation is the era when the nation is in a dormant state. It can be said that that era did not create the "nation" and "national spirit" in the real sense. The expression of the "Middle Ages" (in comparison with modern times) is sinking into death rather than activity, stopping rather than developing. Therefore, the universal "activity" and "development" of a modern nation are the starting point of the entire nation. In other words, in order to create and develop a nation, it is necessary to destroy things that are "medieval" and similar to "medieval" expressions. But this is a process of struggle, and it must rely on the awakened elements in the nation to call on the entire nation to go in this direction and to reject the opposite side of the nation. Because it knows that this is the condition for creating a "national spirit"—that is, the condition for "national self-gathering" and "national self-understanding." Therefore, a nation is still in a state of ignorance, and it is still unaware of striving for the development of its own spirit. That is really because in its own historical development, it has not cleared the historical path for its own development and the development of its own spirit. A nation that wants its own development and the development of its own spirit must first strive to eliminate the various conditions that hinder it. When the Chinese nation entered the modern era, it had done the work of struggling to eliminate this kind of "Middle Ages," but it did not complete it. Therefore, so far, the "Middle Ages" has become everything—or all shackles—that is pressing down on the heads of the entire nation, whether it is "restoration and reaction," whether it is the lack of freedom of speech and publication, whether it is the supremacy of thought... all are the same result. But all of these are obviously the most convenient methods for the national spirit to be paralyzed and stopped. The national spirit has entered a state of decline, and there is no more talk of "liberating itself." This is the real sorrow. I ask, under this state, what kind of serious reaction and what kind of response methods can the Chinese nation still generate in the face of the arrival of foreign enemies?</p>
<p>We should now often be aware that we first need a society and ideological conditions for the nation to develop freely and expand freely. Whatever contains the essence of hindering the free development and expansion of the national spirit in any environment and in any idea should be eliminated. In other words, everything that contains the essence of past "Middle Ages" legends should be eliminated. Because it violates the interests of national development, and it is simply the most unforgivable criminal of national interests. The historical task of clearing the obstacles to the free development of the national spirit is consistent with the demand for national independence. Internal national liberation and external national liberation are two sides of the same thing. We say: the social and ideological conditions that hinder the free development of the national spirit are the conditions for the death of the Chinese national spirit, and also the conditions for the death of the Chinese nation. Striving for the free and democratic development of the national spirit is the firm prerequisite for saving the nation's "national crisis."</p>
<p>The serious and devastated situation now is the last test of gold. All those who have thoughts and have not "died in their hearts," please consider the real "sorrow of the nation" and their own responsibilities.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Regarding the Complete Works of Gong Ding'an <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— World Book Company</p>
<p>Among the famous Chinese classics published by our company is a collection of the Complete Works of Gong Ding'an. Ding'an was a great writer of the Qing Dynasty, possessing a vast and unrestrained talent. His prose was broad, profound, and remarkably modern, while his poetry was even more beautiful and elegant, imbued with a unique charm. It has been widely circulated for a long time and is a rare masterpiece in Chinese literature. Therefore, our company commissioned Mr. Wang Wenru to meticulously organize and proofread it using the methods of the imperial examination, aiming for perfection and benefiting students. Since its publication, it has been widely praised by society. Recently, we have seen two reviews of this book, one being Mr. Zhang Gongliang's review in the Book Supplement of the Ta Kung Pao, issue 102, and the other being Mr. Hong Shu's article in the Publishing World of Shen Bao (issue 31). Both gentlemen have expressed doubts and misunderstandings regarding the editor and proofreader, the elderly Mr. Wang Wenru, and therefore, our company feels compelled to make a statement.</p>
<p>The so-called "Hao Hao Zi" is none other than Mr. Wang Wenru's former pen name. Wang Wenru is the real name of Hao Hao Zi, which is known to all his friends. This point need not be answered by our company. However, Mr. Wang, nearing seventy years of age, passed away this autumn. The edition printed by the Chinese Studies Rotary Club was personally revised by Mr. Wang and published in the first year of Xuantong, but has long been out of print. In the winter of the 22nd year, Mr. Wang Wenru revised the old edition, adding supplements to create a complete edition, and handed it over to our company for publication. Due to our company's busy printing schedule, the manuscript was delayed for two years before finally being published this summer. This is the background of how this collection came to be. With this clarification, it should be clear that Mr. Wang Wenru would never "appropriate the work of others as his own." Our company, with its reputation for serving the cultural community for over a decade, would never deceive its readers.</p>
<p>We welcome and appreciate Mr. Hong Shu's enthusiastic criticism of the annotations to this collection. However, we believe that our annotations to the "Ode to Zhigui Zi" are not in error. After checking Ding'an's chronology, around the age of thirty-two, he repeatedly failed the imperial examinations. At the age of thirty-three, Mr.... studied Buddhism, with Tie Jun as his first teacher. Together with Renhe Qian Dongfu, they resided with the monk Shici Fenghua, all revering the writings of Chan Master Chewu. ... He extensively studied Tibetan, Western, Mongolian, Hui, and Manchu languages, revising the entire collection of scriptures, and consulting with experts of both old and new translations. ... Since the translation of scriptures into China, there had never been such a comprehensive effort. He also borrowed scriptures from the monk Weiyi of Longquan Temple, holding the Dharani recitation for 490,000 volumes and establishing a daily course to chant the texts of Samantabhadra and the Universal Eye Sutra. According to this, Ding'an had a deep love for Buddhism in his middle age, and the annotation stating that he "escaped to Zen due to frustration" is not inconsistent with the facts. ... In fact, the Complete Works of Ding'an has its own inherent value, and we believe that reassessing the content is more important than commenting on the annotations. But regardless, this collection remains the most complete edition of Ding'an's works available in the market, as Mr. Zhang Gongliang has acknowledged. As for any unrecorded posthumous works of Ding'an, if Mr. Hong Shu possesses such printed editions and would generously share them to benefit readers, we would be especially grateful.</p>

<p>— Li Hengzhi</p>
<p>The Business of Books</p>
<p>There are many people (especially those so-called writers who write some texts themselves) who believe that as long as the content of the book is good, people will naturally buy it. Therefore, the main problem in running a bookstore is not sales but publishing. Some who are more astute know that after a book is published, it still needs advertising and promotion. Because of this lack of understanding, many bookstores close their doors, and many writers quarrel with bookstore owners as a result.</p>
<p>The decisive factor for all commodities is the market, and books are no different. The commodity dumping of international capitalism requires Chinese compradors to penetrate deep into the interior; it cannot simply walk away on its own because its price is low and its quality is good. It is truly difficult for new books published by new bookstores to reach the hands of readers. Except for one or two large bookstores that have branches in various places, it is just as difficult for new books from other bookstores to invade various places for sale as it is for commodities from international capitalist countries to need a comprador; they cannot be sold without the brokers of inland booksellers. Due to the weakness of the unified market function in China, various industries still have remnants of guilds. These inland booksellers also have their own cliques. The corruption of old-style Chinese merchants is well known, and the new book industry is no exception simply because it falls within the scope of cultural undertakings.</p>
<p>Booksellers can also be called inland bookstores. Their origins are of two different types. One type evolved from booksellers who used to sell old books such as stone-printed "Prodigy Poems" and "Hundred Family Surnames." The other type arose with the development of the new book industry. Now, there is no difference between them. Their only business is to sell new books from new bookstores in Shanghai and other ports to their locations. Their scale varies. Some are very large, such as the Pei Wen Zhai and Yu Yu Wen in North China, which even have their own branches and well-organized sales networks. However, most are small in scale. Their only business method is to connect with local schools to promote their sales—of course, this is only the case for a few. Most only have a storefront, do some advertising, and entice readers to buy on their own. But even so, they have a significant impact on the new book industry. Without them, your new book would not be able to reach their location, and you would lose that market. Naturally, this is also due to the generally low level of education in China. Otherwise, readers who need books could simply order by mail, without the need for their intermediaries at all. But in reality, most Chinese readers of new books cannot pay attention to the publication of the books they need at any time. The sale of general books is nothing more than: "Oh, is there such a book? I'll buy one." If a book cannot be placed in front of the reader, there will be no sales.</p>
<p>Thus, managers and salesmen of new bookstores in Shanghai must win over those inland booksellers. However, the inland booksellers treat the book business no differently than they treat the business of foreign cloth and sundries; they simply sell books as one of the commodities. They have no opinions on culture, academics, or even the content of the books—they simply don't understand. What they value most is: First, will this book sell? Second, what is the price and discount of this book, and is it profitable for us? Third, is there any political problem with this book, that is, will the Public Security Bureau seal their doors for selling this book? (In the past, there were too many such incidents). Their profits depend entirely on the large-scale sale of books. This inevitably leads them to favor a few large bookstores. Therefore, their main business relies on books from a few large bookstores. For newly opened small bookstores, because they do not know which books are stable and can be sold in large quantities, they generally do not want to distribute them. As a result, there are often such interesting things happening:</p>
<p>"No, this kind of book doesn't sell. It's too much trouble to keep accounts!" The inland bookseller said to the manager of the newly opened bookstore, even though those books are the most valuable and the most likely to sell.</p>
<p>"Friend, please help me out. I'm just asking you to take it and try to sell it. You can have it as a gift. You don't have to send it back if you can't sell it." The shrewd manager begged like this. After the bookseller took the books to the interior and sold them all, and the readers flocked to buy them, the bookseller, driven by profit, would inevitably ask the new bookstore to replenish the stock. At that time, the new bookstore manager's plan would succeed, either by asking the bookseller for payment or even by not sending the books if the payment did not come.</p>
<p>If a small new bookstore wants to develop its sales network, it must win over inland booksellers. But inland booksellers, because of the location of the source of their goods, in turn flatter those large new bookstores. Their most important method is to secure special agency rights. The so-called "special agency" means exclusive sales within a certain area. Everywhere we see, in addition to "exclusive sales office of a certain bookstore in a certain place," there are also "branch of a certain bookstore in a certain place." These so-called branches are mostly unrelated to the main store; they are just special sales agents. New bookstores can use the relationship of special sales to accept a certain amount of deposit, and also stipulate that the special sales office must achieve a certain amount of business each year. If the books published by that bookstore sell well, then the sales agent will naturally obey the bookstore. Otherwise, if the new books are stopped from being sent, the sales agent will have to close their doors. Therefore, the larger the scale of the new bookstore, the easier it is to collect debts. Some say that in today's new bookstore business, where most people suffer bad debts or cannot collect debts, the accounts of the Commercial Press's sales offices will not go unpaid. This is why.</p>
<p>In order to expand the sales network, new bookstores make great efforts to win over inland booksellers and small bookstores. Large bookstores are even more favored. Inland booksellers, whether they are owners or managers, mostly come to Shanghai once every festival or every year to settle accounts and order goods. The organization of the Chinese New Book Industry Association may not have much important function, but there is a kind of natural unity on Fourth Horse Road in Shanghai. Whenever an inland bookseller arrives in Shanghai, managers and salesmen of various bookstores who have some affection for each other will pass the word around, as if a living god of wealth has arrived. They will treat them to dinner, win them over, and do their best. If the bookseller brings some cash to pay the bill or order goods, then the inn where he stays will be as bustling as a marketplace. Colleagues often have disagreements over this. Which bookstore's bill has been paid, which bookstore's goods have been allocated less, everyone will compete.</p>
<p>The old-style Chinese commercial dealings are built on so-called "friendship." "I have a friendship with you, you have to pay me more money, and add more goods for me." The methods of creating "friendship" are wine, opium, mahjong, watching plays, and so on. It was like this before, and it is still mostly like this now. Although we dare not say that all the business of the new book industry is like this, no one can deny that this set of things still exists. Therefore, there are often booksellers who come to Shanghai to settle accounts and end up with syphilis all over their bodies, unable to return home. This is of course mostly due to their own weak will, but it cannot be said that it is not related to that kind of improper social intercourse. Some say that the decline of Chinese commerce is due to the poor transaction system. If we borrow this saying to apply to the new book industry, then the way the new book industry does "business" really needs to be improved. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Recently, the price of Xiang lotus seeds has risen sharply due to the lack of inventory in the Hankou market. According to reports, the remaining 120 boxes of Wuxi lotus seeds were snapped up by various merchants at 40.4 yuan each. Hengyang lotus seeds were sold at 39.4 yuan, and the only five boxes of Xiangtan lotus seeds were also sold at 40.4 yuan. Lower-grade seeds were sold at 36.8 yuan, rising by 4 to 6 yuan each. It is estimated that there are less than a hundred pieces in Hankou in total. Even high-grade Hengyang lotus seeds are priced at 40.4 yuan. Even if some goods arrive en route, they will definitely be hoarded. Telegrams from Changde also reported a rise of 3 to 4 yuan, and further tightening is expected.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight, with further price increases. The association's quotation for spot No. 24 raw white sugar was 22.6 yuan, up 0.1 yuan.

<h3 id="e183">Oil Market: Chen Hong Tung Oil Sells Out and Prices Soar <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of white tung oil soared, the cost of Hongjiang tung oil has increased exponentially. New oil has not yet arrived. It is reported that various oil mills in the production area calculate the cost per barrel to be above 30 yuan, even for the secondary brand. However, the consumption of domestic products is not as high as one-tenth or two-tenths of the export trade. Moreover, after the bankruptcy of rural areas, the purchasing power of farmers is weak. If the price is too high, it will hinder sales. Even with the secondary Hongjiang oil priced at 30 yuan per barrel, it is already a rare sight in the domestic sales market. However, it is still insufficient in terms of cost. Therefore, it can be asserted that the sales market for new oil in the future will definitely be less than in previous years. All the old oil in this port is about to be sold out. Only one or two out of ten companies have a slight inventory. The price of Zhen Hong Jichanghe has been sold to 37.6 yuan per barrel. Fu Hong Yang Hengyuan has already sold out. Qing Yuanfeng is selling at over 30 yuan. Buyers must pay 31 yuan to purchase. It is the highest price since the market began.</p>
<h3 id="e184">White Tung Oil with Fluctuating Prices <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The recent situation of white tung oil has been erratic, with prices rising and falling constantly. However, the selling price in the Hankou market has always been around 50 yuan per dan. The highest price last week soared to 52.8 yuan, but this week it has fallen back to 50 yuan. The attitude of foreign firms is that around 50 yuan is still a reasonable price. If it is as high as 55 or 56 yuan, then they may or may not buy. At 50 yuan to enter customs, all foreign firms want to purchase. Therefore, whenever the price in the Hankou market falls to 47 or 48 yuan, foreign firms will definitely rush to purchase. As a result, there is no hope for overly cheap prices. Moreover, in recent months, it has become the number one export commodity in our country, and those engaged in this business have paid very close attention. The future situation will generally be around 50 yuan as the lowest limit. Foreign firms in this port also have occasional small transactions, but one or twenty tons are not enough to move people's hearts. It is not as good as the hundreds of tons in the Hankou market, which can influence the market.</p>

<p>As the end of the year approaches, most British merchants are closing their businesses. Foreign trade of green teas such as Zhen Mei and Zhen Mei has almost completely stopped. However, the sales of Xiu Mei green tea in stores and shops have suddenly become brisk. Winter sales in Tianjin, Shandong, and Qingdao are all moving.

<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, and also Christmas, so all agencies, foreign firms, and major commercial firms were closed for one day. The metal trade was also very sparse. Moreover, with the continuous rain, there were even fewer visitors to the market. Among the goods on offer, except for the frenzied purchase of new galvanized wire by Sichuan merchants, there were very few transactions for other goods. The market was calm, with no major changes. It is said that new galvanized wire such as Nos. 8, 10, 12, and 16 to 25 were all on offer. It is reported that the total number of transactions reached as many as 2,450 bundles. The most number of offers came from metal firms along North Suzhou Road. The merchants who bought the most were Yuhecheng, Xie Kang, and Chuan Han Cheng. In addition, the Sichuan Commercial Company of Wanxian also bought quite a lot. In short, since the purchase of new galvanized wire, the amount of goods in the market has felt reduced. If there are not many arrivals within the year, then the future market trend may be upward.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Yarn and Cotton: Major Changes in the Yarn and Cotton Market in the Past Week Various Market Prices Exceeding the Highest Peaks Many Brokers Reorganized A Glimpse of the Recent Bull and Bear Front <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>In the past week, the yarn and cotton market suddenly showed a lively trend. Overseas silver shrank sharply, and the gold standard rose from around 1,150 yuan to 1,200 yuan, reaching the peak since the reform of the legal tender. Market rumors spread like wildfire, saying that customs gold units were about to rise sharply. Speculators were actively involved, and financial circles, securities firms, gold traders, and public debt merchants all focused on the yarn and cotton market. The momentum was extremely fierce, and the market gradually soared. The low price of May futures was 201.5 yuan before December 17th, but reached a peak of 211.8 yuan on the 23rd, rising by 10.3 yuan. Later, because the sales of spot yarn were not very brisk, and the end of the year was approaching, the demand from all parties shrank. Manufacturers began to sell, and at the same time, the gold standard turned from a peak to a decline. A wave of enthusiasm was temporarily dispersed. However, the overseas calculated prices for American cotton rose by 1.3 yuan, while Indian cotton only rose by 0.6 yuan. The current cotton market is sluggish due to factory demand, and export trade has stalled. Japanese merchants are also hesitant to purchase. Therefore, it is difficult to revive market prices. However, the low price of May futures for gold standard cotton was 43.22 yuan on the 16th, and rose to 45.85 yuan on the 23rd, which shows the general craze for speculation. Recently, the chips of both bulls and bears have been increasing day by day. Once there is a change, the range of ups and downs becomes larger and larger. It is not surprising that each market rises or falls by 2-3 yuan. In fact, with this group of new troops, there will inevitably be many events in the future. If the environment is slightly favorable, the momentum will come like swarming bees, and it is extremely difficult to resist the sharp momentum. The future changes are difficult to predict. The situation of brokerages in the exchange changing hands is even more developed. No. 1 has been renamed Deda, No. 70 has been changed to Jinkang, No. 37 has been changed to Changxing, No. 38 has been changed to Huamao, and No. 63 has been changed to Jinghua, and they have all started business on the market. It is said that most of the capital is added by public debt, gold, and banking circles. Therefore, the transfer fee for brokerage licenses has improved compared to before. The recent yarn lineup shows that those buying are Tongji, Dafu, Jinchang, Gengfeng, Yuanyi, Changfeng, and Jinkang, ranging from 4,700 bales to 13,100 bales. The majority of the buyers are in the banking, gold, and public debt sectors. Those selling are Yudada, Dafeng, Daji, Hexing, Tongfeng, Shenji, Yichang, and Ruida, ranging from 7,000 bales to 10,000 bales. Fellow traders, some merchants, Japanese merchants are the center. The buyers of gold standard cotton are Tongji with 64,700 dan, Changhe with 59,100 dan, and Gengfeng with 23,500 dan as giants. The sellers are Shenchang with 38,800 dan, Shenji with 35,300 dan, Yuanxingchang with 44,500 dan, Kehe with 23,000 dan, and Yikang with 21,600 dan. The recent week's comparison of the current and futures prices of Chinese and foreign cotton yarn is listed below for reference:</p>

<p>The standard yarn and cotton market was closed for one day due to the Yunnan Uprising anniversary. Although some spot merchants still gathered in the market, but because futures yarn was not being auctioned, most were unwilling to take action. Therefore, there were no transactions. The overseas cotton market remained weak, and the prices of American and Indian cotton fell, which dampened people's spirits.</p>

<p>Retail Price Index: The general index is 103.3, an increase of 9.8% compared to 94.1 last month, and an increase of 5.1% compared to 98.3 in the same month last year.

Compared with last month, all types of indices have increased. The metal category increased by 14.0%. Due to the lack of spot goods, the prices of copper ingots and large lead bars have risen sharply, increasing by 43% and 32% respectively. Black iron pipes increased by 23%, and small tin ingots increased by 17%. Other items such as round steel and tinplate have also increased. Building materials increased by 12.6%. Except for cement, all items increased. Fir and paint oil increased by 33% and 25% respectively. Textiles increased by 12.3%.

<p>The comparison of cotton field production in various provinces in the 24th year and the revised estimate in the 23rd year is as follows:</p>
<p>6.  Over twenty silk factories in this city have suspended operations due to the shortage of raw silk for various types of silk. Production has decreased and market prices have soared. Last month, the price per dan of Huangchang silk was 520 yuan, Ji Li Gan silk was 450 yuan, and Bai Chang silk was 710 yuan.

This index has been extremely low in recent years. This month's index is the highest since September 1932. Among all items, 55 items increased, 5 items decreased, and 6 items remained unchanged. Compared with last month, all three types of indices have increased sharply. Raw materials increased by 12.9%. Most items have risen sharply, especially dried silk floss, rapeseed, red sorghum, factory silk waste, soybeans, sesame, and bulk coal, with increases ranging from 20% to 56%. Manufactured goods increased by 10.4%. Except for tung oil, which saw a sharp drop of 25% due to the new goods entering the market, most goods have increased, especially various types of raw silk, raw oil, and soybean oil. Consumer goods increased by 7.6%. Prices of silk, crepe, egg yolk, eggs, green tea, coarse cloth, firewood, and charcoal have all risen sharply.</p>
<p>Import Price Index: The general index is 141., an increase of 15.4% compared to 123.7 last month, and an increase of 5.9% compared to 134.8 in the same month last year. This month's index is the highest record since November 1931. Among all items, 69 items increased, 1 item decreased, and 12 items remained unchanged. Compared with last month, all three types of indices have increased sharply. Raw materials increased by 21.1%. Items that have risen sharply include copper ingots, fir, large lead bars, American cotton, and tin solder, with increases ranging from 20% to 43%. Consumer goods increased by 14.1%, such as kerosene, white sugar, Florida oranges, White Tower oil, and black pepper, with increases ranging from 20% to 27%. Manufactured goods increased by 11.9%. Market prices of items such as white wood yarn increased by 32%, glossy paper and Daolin paper increased by 30%, kraft paper increased by 29%, rayon, black iron pipes, and diesel increased by 23%, motor oil increased by 22%, and angle iron increased by 21%. The increase rate for most items ranges from 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index: The general index is 109.2, an increase of 5.1% compared to 103.9 last month, and an increase of 0.4% compared to 108.8 in the same month last year. Among all items, 30 items increased, 3 items decreased, and 10 items remained unchanged. The reason for the increase is partly due to the impact of retail prices, and partly due to the sharp depreciation of copper coins. The average exchange rate on the 1st and 15th of last month was 342 coins, but the average this month has shrunk to 318 coins, which means that retail prices quoted in copper coins have increased by about 7% when converted to national currency. Except for rent, all five types of indices have increased compared with last month. Fuel increased by 10.5% due to the increase in kerosene, firewood, and matches. Clothing increased by 6.7%, with various types of cotton cloth increasing. Miscellaneous items increased by 5.1%, including cigarettes, soap, toothpaste, etc., which are all priced in copper coins in the market. Food increased by 4.6%. Although soybean oil, soybeans, flour, and white sugar have increased sharply, spinach, green vegetables, and radishes have plummeted due to seasonal factors and abundant production. Therefore, the increase in this category of index is relatively moderate. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Empty Positions Covered When American Cotton Closed</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, the situation was stagnant, with a decline of 2 to 6 points in each month. The market focused on the December term. Before the cessation of the December term, only two delivery notices were issued, the last bull position in the December term was liquidated, and the January term was greatly affected. However, other months were still relatively firm, and dealers were still buying. Empty positions shifted to October, and there were few transactions, showing signs of the upcoming holiday. When closing, empty positions were covered, and the market rose again. The spot price fell by 5 points, and futures prices, except for the first month (January) which fell by 3 points, rose by 2 to 4 points for the remaining months. The spot price of English cotton fell by 5 points, and the futures price fell by 3 points. Bull positions in Indian cotton were liquidated, and European exporters sold off.

<h3 id="e194">Our Country's Foreign Policy <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>New Foreign Minister Zhang Qun stated his foreign policy to journalists on the 18th, saying that China's foreign policy is to seek the adjustment of international relations with sincerity and integrity, and to abolish unequal obligations through legal channels. This is the foreign policy of our government. The Japanese government should be very satisfied with this, and there is no suspicion that our country has any [anti-foreign] sentiments.</p>
<p>Since the [September 18th Incident], Japan has often accused our government of not having full [sincerity] in accepting the [friendship] and [cooperation] policies it proposed. This is the Japanese government blaming us for lacking integrity in international relations. But with our people's ignorant thinking, we can always figure out that the so-called sincerity and integrity should first be based on mutual benefit and equality. While Japan is occupying a large amount of our country's territory by force and continues to attack the interior of China, it blames our country for lacking integrity in international relations. It is really impossible to know where integrity can be established? Unless China completely becomes India or Korea, and before the Chinese people are completely bombed by Japanese planes and bombs, we really cannot find where this international integrity under command can be established.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen, in his Three Principles of the People, explained with the utmost seriousness that the first way for China to seek independence and liberation is to abolish the various unequal treaties imposed on us by foreign countries. What are these unequal treaties? "They are the deeds of sale of the entire Chinese nation]!" This is the most brilliant sentence that Mr. Sun Yat-sen ever said. At the moment of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death, in his last and most important will—the will that everyone respectfully reads today—he earnestly instructed his descendants: "[Recently advocated convening a national assembly. And abolishing unequal treaties, it is especially necessary to promote their realization in the shortest possible time." Where did the various unequal treaties imposed on China come from? This was created by the force of artillery and airplanes. Japan graciously tells us: If China wants to abolish unequal treaties, it should do so after [establishing its own national system and improving the modern national structure] (see the Japanese Associated Press telegram on the 19th). We really cannot know how China, with more than 3.8 million square miles of territory, can establish its own national system while it is directly occupied by force, and how more than 1.2 million square miles of territory (Hebei and Chahar provinces) can improve its modern national structure under the control of foreign forces, with the possibility of being directly occupied immediately? Unequal treaties are fundamentally illegal things. It is somewhat vague to ask imperialism to automatically withdraw from the territory it occupies in our country through peaceful negotiations, unless the earth can turn over.</p>
<p>In fact, to establish China's own national system and improve the modern national structure is not impossible. As the saying goes: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," this is the only way for China to establish its own national system and improve the modern national structure.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah! How hateful, how hateful! How hateful that I have been utterly defeated! I wish I could cut off that cunning Zhuanxu's head and use it as my drinking vessel!" At that time, Gonggong had already fled to the broken part of Buzhou Mountain. His legs were so sore that he could not support himself, and he was so thirsty that he sat down and licked the blood on his knife. His partisans were scattered at the foot of Buzhou Mountain. (15)</p>
<h3 id="e196">Fist <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Ahu had a pair of fists, iron fists. Relying on this pair of fists, he stood astride both banks of the Yellow River, and his fists hit north, south, east and west. He dominated this street.</p>
<p>Ahu had no home. During the day, he waited in the teahouse for the sun to set, and at night he nested in the gambling house. But he didn't gamble for money. The gambling house boss provided him with food and bedding just because he had a pair of fists. Ahu sat in the gambling house, and the gamblers did not dare to owe debts or fight. Ahu patted his chest with complacency: "Bah, my fists!"</p>
<p>In the eyes of respectable people, Ahu was a thorough rascal. He walked swaying and filled the entire street. A cheap felt hat was perched on his back. He never wore long clothes all year round. The buttons on his short clothes were densely arranged like ribs. Around his waist was a silk belt embroidered with two dragons snatching a pearl. His face was covered with bulging muscles, and half a cigarette butt was stuck to the corner of his mouth. Even before you saw him, you could hear a series of "Damn your mother!" But when he stepped onto the street, he was the boss. No one dared to call him Ahu to his face. He had a ledger with him. He used circles and lines to record the names and amounts of each debtor. He came out of the gambling house and collected money from the street stalls. For example, if you borrowed one yuan, you would pay back ten cents of silver every day for ten days. If you borrowed ten yuan, you would pay back one yuan every day. The stallholders would never be able to pay off his debts. If the old debts were not cleared, he could lend you money again to repay the debts. The circles and lines on the ledger would never be erased. However, Ahu had a pair of iron fists, and his fists created his position.</p>
<p>With his pockets full of silver dollars and coins, Ahu went to the teahouse. The teahouse owner always greeted him with a smiling face: "Good business?"</p>
<p>Ahu shook his head. He didn't understand business. "I have capital to lend, so I'm not afraid they'll be short a penny!" As he said this, he threw the money from his pocket onto the table. He stretched his legs and firmly propped his back against the wall, calculating according to the marks on the ledger. At the place where a bearded old man was drawn, Ahu opened his mouth with triangular eyes.</p>
<p>"Boss, where does that damned son of Qian Laotou live? Damn it! He hasn't come to the street to do business for three days. Humph, does he want to赖债(lai zhai)?" See my fists!" With a bang, he slammed the table, causing it to yell.</p>
<p>The teahouse owner smiled at him. Ahu's pair of lawless fists had lost their effect on Qian Laotou. The boss slowly walked over, imitating Ahu's strength, and patted him on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"Boss, are you looking for Qian Laotou? You'll have to wear iron shoes to collect this陰債(yin zhai)!"</p>
<p>"What?" The boss shouted: "Did this old man die three days ago?"</p>
<p>Ahu opened the ledger, cursing "Damn it!" in his mouth, calculating those horizontal and vertical marks: "Humph, it's twenty-five yuan! Since he hasn't paid interest for three days, add three yuan, three corners, and two cents. Boss, does he have anyone else at home? If he doesn't pay me back, watch my fists!" Another bang.</p>
<p>"He has a sixteen-year-old daughter," a gambler in the gambling house抢着(qiang zhe) said: "Isn't it worth it to buy a wife for twenty-eight yuan?"</p>
<p>Ahu smiled. For many years, he had only been obsessed with money. He had never thought about getting a woman. This was an opportunity to get a wife to play with. Ahu thought, grabbed his pocket, and rushed down the teahouse.</p>
<p>That night, Ahu didn't return to the gambling house. The gamblers talked, saying that he had gone to find Qian Laotou's daughter. One gambler even joked:</p>
<p>"Does anyone want to borrow money? Go to Miss Qian, and don't be afraid of his fists."</p>
<p>Ahu didn't go to the street the next day. People with good intentions went to Qian Laotou's house. The door of Qian Laotou's house was敞着(chang zhe), and there was no one there. Ahu was lying in Miss Qian's bed, with blood flowing on the bed. Ahu's pair of iron fists were chopped off, his eyes rolled back, and he was断气了(duan qi le).</p>
<p>The local保(bao) secretly reported to the police station, raised money for a pine coffin to bury him, and no one dared to bring up this matter.</p>

<p>When people have happy events, they use opera performances to celebrate. Often the performance of actors with court robes continues until the end of the celebration. This is a performance celebrating the birthday of Guo Fenyang. My wife, Yao Furen, asked me, "The court robes fill the courtyard, it can be said to be grand. What will happen after this?" I said, "You must have something to say. Please tell me." Madame said, "Please allow me to recite a poem. 'The old mountains and rivers in front of the gate have not changed. The broken captives once served under Ma Fubo. In the future, I will pass through the place of singing and dancing alone. The ancient locust trees are sparse and the setting sun is plentiful.' This is Zhao Gu's poem passing through the old residence of Fenyang. 'The old residence of Fenyang is now a temple. Only the singing and dancing tower remains from that time. Forty years have passed, the carriages and horses have dispersed. The ancient locust trees are deep in the alleys, and the evening cicadas are sorrowful.' This is Zhang Ji's poem about the East Tower of Faxiong Temple. If you want to know what happened after the actors with court robes have finished, please recite these two poems." I was saddened. Now that my wife has passed away, I recall this and write it down.</p>

<p>Opening: "Winter Lament"</p>
<p>Last night in my dream, I saw my beloved. His appearance unchanged from the old days. My love, I think it's you. Once gone, there is no news. I am, yearning until the autumn waters dry up, my heart broken with sorrow. How hateful, you are indulging in wine and revelry, singing and dancing. How hateful, you are abandoning your wife and children, leaving your home. How hateful, you are picking flowers and playing with grass, not cherishing yourself. How hateful, you are wasting money and lacking judgment. Oh, my husband, I think it's you. From a scholarly family, the son of an official. You should, always remember to study. Oh, my husband, why. Are you wandering around without restraint? Ignoring, the internal and external troubles that are rampant daily. If you were loyal to the country and shook the mountains and rivers. Bringing glory to your ancestors and having prestige. I hate you, for my sincere advice is in vain. Good medicine is bitter to the taste, and my liver is broken in vain. I am, lamenting my thin life with no support. It's better to, quickly seek death to see the King of Hell. The madam spoke to the point of sadness. Unable to help it, two lines of tears fell onto her chest. Luckily, she has a clever and understanding maid. She advised the madam with earnest words. Saying, madam, the master is, naturally promiscuous and difficult to cure. Even if you cry until your liver breaks, it will only hurt you in vain. I advise you, madam. Don't worry. Don't be sad. Endure these bitter times. I hope the master, suddenly awakens and returns home. I guarantee you, he will revive the family and make the family name fragrant. Husband's glory, wife's honor, it's truly joyful. Even this little maid, in her heart, is also happy. The madam listened and said yes. She re-combed her dark hair and put on new makeup. Sweeping away the sadness from her face.</p>
<p>Xing Ruiting Hairpin Phoenix</p>
<p>Huiling (1380) 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "The Widow"</p>
<p>The cold moon shines brightly through the gauze window. A woman with a wretched fate guards a cold room. Without rouge and powder, her face is pale. Facing the mirror, she sighs with tears in her eyes. Dressed in plain white, her moth-like eyebrows are lowered. Silently, she thinks secretly. Remembering how happy she was when she married her beloved. They flew together like loving mandarin ducks. His love was like lacquer, deeply fond of her. Her affection was like glue, tied to her beloved. She really hoped to live a long life with him in harmony. With inseparable mandarin ducks singing in harmony forever. Who knew. The river of love is vast and full of storms. Taking her beloved's life. I, the widow, originally intended to follow him to the underworld. But I have elders in the family hall. I can only, endure the lingering grief and steal a remnant of life. Endure tears and secretly hurt myself. Evening and morning, I frequently worship before his spirit tablet. Tears flow like ropes as I offer pepper sauce. His remaining appearance is vivid as I look with concentration. No wonder he always smiles at me. I look at myself. He thinks of himself. How can I get him to comfort my heart with gentle and warm words? He must know that I have wasted my youth and my appearance is haggard. Like a flower without a master, blooming in vain. Sleeping in a cold quilt is like iron. The simple curtain is a lonely phoenix after his death. The sad years are like bitter weeds. The splendor has all turned into a yellow dream. To whom can I tell my grievances? I store ten thousand kinds of regrets in my heart. How pitiful, her delicate cries are like flowing water. Startling the cold crows to fly far away. The parrot does not know human hatred. In front of the curtain, it still imitates the sound of crying. She cried until her voice was hoarse, her tears were exhausted, and she had no strength. Only then did she wipe both eyes with silk. Panting, she stood up and leaned on the dressing table. Lazily, she slowly stepped onto the bed. How pitiful, her soul communicates faintly in the underworld. She meets her lover in the land of Hua胥. When she wakes up, it's still just a dream.</p>

<p>The weather in Jiangnan in June is fine,</p>
<p>Sisters are picking red water chestnuts in the pool,</p>
<p>The sharp water chestnuts prick your hands,</p>
<p>The scorching sun scorches people.</p>
<p>Oh my God! God,</p>
<p>There is no rain during the plum rain season,</p>
<p>There is no 18-year-old girl who does not marry,</p>
<p>Thinking of youth in the water chestnut mirror.</p>
<p>Wang Guilin of the Yi Hua sound film "Triumphant Song", which will be released soon, said to everyone: "We don't rely on heaven, we don't ask God!"</p>
<p>When Meiyun sang to here very sweetly and at the same time very sadly, Liu Li smiled and shamed her and said, "Sister, aren't you afraid of being embarrassed?" And just as Meiyun was about to raise her hand to hit Liu Li, a burst of laughter suddenly flew from the shore. Meiyun raised her head and took a look. I couldn't help but blush and feel extremely ashamed.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful scene in the upcoming Yi Hua sound film, a huge production directed by Bu Wancang, "Triumphant Song". The clear and melodious singing makes people intoxicated and forget all the worries in the world.</p>

Under this scorching sun, he has no choice but to work hard to draw water, but because he is old and weak, he is of no use. On the other hand, the neighboring fields have sufficient water due to machine pumping. He couldn't help but feel jealous, so he tied the embankment to divert the water from the neighboring fields into his own, but in the end, he couldn't bear his conscience and filled the breach again. However, the matter was discovered, and he was beaten and injured. Qin, as an old man, could not withstand the destruction of violence. His head was already broken and bleeding, and he was dying!</p>
