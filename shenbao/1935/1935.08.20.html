<h3 id="c4">浙東之金融危機 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— 磬</p>
<p>自漢口源裕銀號倒閉。寗波各莊受損約八十萬元。少數內容空虛之錢莊。卽以提存受擠。深感週轉困難之苦痛。至上月二十九日。大同行衍源·信源·兩錢莊。首吿擱淺。繼之又有大小同行永源·泰源·五源等三家。同時停業。不及數日。大小同行擱淺倒閉者。凡二十八家。佔該埠錢業總數三分之一。不僅缺單各莊無法維持。卽多單各莊。亦多受累停業。至八月三日下午。交易所停止拍板。全體錢業亦暫停收解。雖經該埠政商當局。漏夜恊議。决定各銀行停收過帳存欵。限止提存。以一百元為度。過此祇許劃帳。並設甚向中·央中國·交通三銀行。商借二百萬元。以為救濟。而停業各莊。亦由政府强制股東墊本復業。風潮始漸見和緩。然而半月以來。大小錢莊因週轉不靈而吿擱淺者。仍右所聞。據量近紀錄陸續擱淺之大小錢莊已達三十四家之多。蓋寗波錢業之症象。已自急性的變而為慢性的矣。</p>
<p>査寗波為浙東大埠。錢業素稱繁榮。曩昔該業放欵。本地及四鄉而外。兼及灑漢各地。而尤以上海為大宗。長期及抵押放欵。合計達三四千萬元。近年雖見收束。然而長期放欵。連利息累計。尙達二千萬元之譜。此項放欵。大抵以南市之海味·藥材·北貨各業及虹口之五金業為歸宿。今者各莊本身。以存欵擠提應付為難。則長期之必需收歸。殆在意中。猶憶四底長期到期之時。少數商號。無法歸償。迄未解决。至今距十底之期。又僅兩月。市面之衰疲依然。商業之呆滯。仍未稍見轉機。寗波各莊。卽欲堅决收歸。其困難亦可想見。</p>
<p>自寗波金融風潮發生以來。與該埠關係密切之石浦·（象山屬）定海·奉化各地。先後均遭波及。消息傳來。如石浦一處。共僅錢莊七家。倒閉者已佔其四。定海錢莊。亦已有三家停業。奉化大橋鎭。則有典當兩家。因此而吿停業。良以此等錢莊典當。素賴寗波各錢莊為之週轉調劑。今者寗波已成僵局。內地自難獨全。是則所謂寗波金融風潮者。殆已擴大而成為淅東之金融恐慌矣。夫舊寗屬各縣。為浙省沿海漁業之中心。在該省經濟上。地位頗稱重要。往昔漁民金融之調劑。向賴當地錢業為之間接貸放。借本漁民雖倍受重利之盤剝。尙能苟延殘喘。今者秋漁之出漁在卽。漁民之需欵方殷。豈知各縣錢業。均吿汲汲危殆。安能望其捨己而耘人。今後之漁民。卽希在重利盤剝下以圖掙扎求存。尙不可得。生活之改蕃。自更無可冀希矣。</p>

<p>西北各省　均樂採購</p>
<p>四川成都方面、頃亦有電來、要求國貨廠商、從速將國貨運往推銷、該電並稱、成都共有居民五萬餘人、均樂於購用國貨、企盼本埠國貨廠商、速將貨品運往、至於重慶一帶、已有國貨商塲設立、營業情形甚佳、陜西省境內各大城市、均已設立國貨商塲、成續亦優良為西北各省之冠、甘肅省政府建設廳日前亦派員到滬、向本埠國貨界接洽褚民誼·陳策·鄒琳、昨乘夜快車晋京、國貨運往銷售辦法、已得結果、故該省較大城邑、不久亦將有國貨商塲設立、</p>
<p>海外市塲　力謀拓展</p>
<p>實業部國際貿易、年來對於國產貨品運往海外推銷事宜、至爲關切、現巳組織中華工業貿易恊會專事討論國貨向海外運銷事宜、南洋一帶最近國貨運往為數甚鉅、以僑胞樂於購用之故、獲利者甚衆、最近一部份國貨廠商、時至該局詢間國貨運往辦法、以所需要之貨品種類、擬組織各廠商聯合銷售機關、將大批精良國貨、運往南洋一帶銷售云、</p>

<p>旅菲華僑鉅商、林書晏·黃永口·曾瑞交·高祖川·薛敏老·林錦谷·林朝聘·李淸泉·等、歸國創辦之華菲烟草公司、廠址在本埠保定路四百廿六號、今日正式開業、此在政府倡導海外僑胞回國投資之政策上、可謂為又一吿成之盛畢、溯旅居菲律濱之華僑、向來創業經營之範圍、祇以菲島為限、雖前有少數僑胞回國、而其事業、大都集中於福建南部、自前年立法院長孫科氏赴菲遊歷、深覺僑胞富於企業力、因卽勸吿返國投資、從事復興民族工業、嗣實業部長陳公博氏去歲南巡時、在菲島勾留一星期、訪問僑胞、復積極鼓勵、共回祖國、開發實業、而當時駐菲總領事　光林氏、則始終努力為同樣之主張、經此番政府方多方之倡導、於是一部分旅菲僑胞、乃决意集　返國、創辦華菲烟草公司、資本不旋踵而募足、</p>
<p>保障專利</p>
<p>先是菲僑在菲組有菲律濱烟草公司、發明雪茄式紙烟一種、名雪茄麗烟、曾得美政府獎勵予以專利權、頗思推銷祖國、顧恐無防止仿製之保障、遂乃裏足小前、此外並製出紙烟數種、亦復不敢推銷鄉邦、後經政府擔保、　此項出品、决予製造及發售專利權、至是在滬分設烟廠之議乃决、經知期內猛進之籌備、爰得於今日正式開　、此為旅菲華僑返國創業之第一聲、目下在菲僑胞、尙有十五萬人、莫不注意此事、將來辦有成效、則他日踩起回國投資者、固大有人在、祖國民族工業、行將為之放一異彩矣、</p>
<p>經理人選</p>
<p>菲律濱烟草公司、對於華菲烟草公司因有大部股權之關係、故派來之管理人選、均屬槃槃大才、總經理為林朝聘君。菲島求是列賽大學工商管理碩士·擅長理財及廣吿學·曾任菲律濱烟草公司總經理十年、副經理為林錦谷君、亦一馳名全菲、興林君相伯仲之菸草鉅商也、</p>
<p>出品種類</p>
<p>華菲烟草公司製造之特色、厥為機器製造、機器包裝、機器概屬最新式者、製造則純採科學方法、目下出品、計有白宮牌雪茄麗烟、英雄牌香烟、及黑姑娘小呂宋甜紙煙三種、而烟質與烟味則互異、（一）白宮牌雪茄麗烟、為雪茄與紙烟之合體、其原料係取該公司在菲島「伊索拜拉」及「卡圖洋」兩著名烟區自有菸田所產之淡巴菰而經過科學之焙製者、外用美國喬治亞州之雪茄烟葉裏之、氣味芬馥、凡常吸雪茄或紙烟之人、吸之定皆滿意、此種出品、乃新發明、完全機製、淸潔衛生、其將來之風行、當可預下、（二）英雄牌香烟、係取精選之佛幾尼亞菸葉、適當配製而成、烟味醇和淸凉、具有來路貨紙烟之一切品質、而新鮮則遠過、製造時亦未經人手接觸、惟烟料從此機移往彼機時、用人工搬運而已、（三）黑姑娘小呂宋甜紙烟、為陳年柔熟之小呂宋卡岡洋區所產菸葉製成、其烟枝較普通紙烟大三成、上述三種出品、售價一律低廉、其白宮牌及黑姑娘兩種尤廉、以便谷界人士均　以極微之代價享吸高等之香烟、</p>
<p>營業方針</p>
<p>據總經理林朝聘君云、售價一事、初非重視、其言曰、一本公司每包香烟之利潤、當然不及其他烟廠之所得、但吾人　以薄利收多賣之功、本公司營業伊始、决着重品質方面、而將來所恃以致勝者、亦惟高超之品質耳、」</p>

<p>他們二人間的友愛是十分深厚的；即使有人因為小橋對小梅親愛的情形而笑他，他也不會因而中止的。他勇武地保護着她，使不被別人所欺侮，他竟不明白為什麽男孩子愛好他們姊妹的時候，會不好意思一直說」出來。小梅也愛她「同胞」兄，自以為『我的哥哥」是世界上最了不得的男孩子，個個早晨，還沒換去那小陲衣的時候，便快步走到他的門口，敲着門，以母親的口吻說道——起來，我的寳，這差不多早晨的時候了；這裏是你的乾凈的領子」。</p>
<p>「羅勃是一個有精神的童子，他似乎已發現了「常恒動機」的奧秘，因為他從不靜下來的。幸而，並不頑皮，也不很勇敢；所以他不甚闖禍。他不絕往來於父親母親間正像一個多情的鐘擺，而且也是滴答滴答的，因為羅勃眞是一具活潑的「話箱」呢。</p>
<p>坦第年齡太輕，在梅莊尙非重要脚色，可是他也有他的小職司，而且當得是很相稱的。個個人有時覺得需要一個寵愛物，而寳實總是準備來遷就着，接吻與緊抱原最合於他的脾胃。裂夫人一舉一動，少有不帶着他的；所以家裏的一切，總有他的份兒，可是人人為此更喜愛他，因為梅莊的人都是相信小寳寳的。</p>
<p>白迪克，貝稻里，是兩個八歲的童子。稻里口吃得利害，不過他已逐漸克制了它，因為裴先生一面要他緩緩發言，又不許別人機吳他，纏擾他。稻里是一個好好的小孩子，不怎麽有趣，可說是平凡的，然而他在這裏長育得很好，每天盡他的責任，享他的樂趣，既滿意，也安分。</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>那是一塊荒地。在三年之前，還是一塊瓦礫之塲。據上年紀的人說，那塊瓦礫塲，從前也是一個大宅。因大宅裏的子孫式微了，所以經一度火毀之後，便沒曾重蓋起屋子來。</p>
<p>就在三年之前的那一年上，鄰近都紛紛傳說着那片荒地已賣了。一個得主是買了那麽整整的一大方，計地四畝多些。一個得主是買了東南角上狹長的那一條，計八分七厘多些。</p>
<p>過了幾天，那二個得主，陸續地上那新買的地上蓋屋子了。四畝多些的地上，蓋的是西班牙式的洋房。四圍有草地，還有佈置得很好的花木。建築工程，足足的有八個多月，才完成。可是那狹長地帶上蓋的屋子呢，只二個月，就已竣工，因為這一家的房屋，是九開間的一埭瓦平房。所有的餘地上，不過把瓦礫爬平了一些，一切都是因陋就簡的。</p>
<p>這兩家的房屋，造好之後，陸續的都遜居了進去。住洋房的那一家，據說是吃政界飯的，所以主人是出進從不理睬人的。就是僕人也都對着隣居，有些似理不理。可是那家住平房的，當工頭的人家，倒是挺相氣的，常和隣居們交往着。</p>
<p>在去年，那個洋房裏的主人，不知犯了甚麽事，丟了官，而且還急死了。身後據說還負着一屁股的債，所以那個洋房，便立卽移轉到了地產公司去。而同時呢！住平房的那一家，因預備娶媳婦，在餘地上，增築了二間屋子。</p>
<p>一時隣近的人們，對洋房瞧一眼，對平房瞧一眼，都會得微微地歎息一聲。</p>

<p>陽軟弱的微光，斜照在都市的屋角簷頭，祇剩得黃金般的色彩，沒有中午時候的那一種氣燄了。</p>
<p>路上的行人，格外來得擁擠，越發顯得熱鬧了。紅綠色的交通燈，像瞬眼似的老是變換。指揮交通的巡捕，吹着叫笛，「的留」「的留」的聲音，不斷地震動那空中的氛圍。</p>
<p>「可噹」「可噹」電車接連地在行駛，每到了一個車站，乘客從車上擁出來了一批，隨後重又擠上了一批，在車廂裏面，竟然再沒有容足的地位了，但是候車的月臺上，仍是立滿了人。賣報的孩子，喊着像念熟了的書句似的喚賣聲，在人叢中穿來穿去，他們眼見着車子駛近過來，於是便一窩蜂的，手拿了夜報，從窗口裏伸進去，喊得分外有勁；到了後來，縮回來的手裏，握着銅子，當然是嬉皮笑臉，心中十分的愉快。那一班仍是執着報紙的可憐孩子，呆呆地望那開遠去的車子，祇好等待那未來的幸運了。</p>

<p>— 王瑜</p>
<p>上海人對於「拉」的手段，確是令人欽佩，二房東太太廂房裏好婆亭子間阿姨三位若高興起來要鬥一桌麻雀，那末客堂樓嫂嫂便無論如何會被拉來凑一桌了。然而單靠「拉」還不興，拉而再說妙話則靈矣：所以「三缺一不來傷陰隲」，此話一說，未有「拉」之不成者。「拉」旣有如此之妙，因此便有靠「拉」吃飯的人產生了。</p>
<p>每當華燈初上時，便有塗足紅脂白粉的神女點綴其間，妖形怪狀大施媚眼，走過來一把拉住路人衣袖便說：「到我家去白相相哪！」這種「拉」的手段是硬中帶軟，軟中帶硬，一拉而上者則一天的吃飯問題可以解决了。只是人們鮮有問津，而伊等又不能硬拉特拉，眞是可恨郤也可憐。</p>
<p>還有每逢坐了黃包車路過垃圾橋等處，便有小癟三過來說聲：「先生，拉一把啊。」就去帮了車夫雙手拉着車槓上橋，拉過之後就得給他一枚銅元，若說不給，他便在你背後大駡其「猪玀，赤老」不已，就好像是一種「過橋稅」，非付不可。</p>
<p>近來因為市面蕭條，石路一帶的舊衣店也大倒其霉，急得幾家老闆夥計站在櫃臺內外，拍竹板地提高了嗓子嘶叫「大减價！」走路的人偶然在店舖門前望望掛着的衣服，一個夥計便會趕上來拉住你問：「要什麼？先生，印度綢的，府綢的，這裏都有！不要走！」這模樣就好似把你當作了大主顧，拉住了你不放，你就得用點勁把身子扭掉他的手呢。這麼着嚇得我下次走過再也不敢望，免得多一番麻煩。</p>
<p>上海「拉的花頭有如此者，實令我可佩郤也可畏！</p>

<p>到了次日，一早就起來了，穿上了長衣馬褂，有時由裏跑到外，有時由外又跑到裏，好像掉了魂一樣，沒有了主張。因為他老是這樣進進出出，身上又有一件馬褂，這惹得全飯店的人，都有些注意。後來茶房說，這就是貼標語的張介夫。大家這也就隨着明白了，他這樣忙進忙出，乃是忙着籌備歡迎事宜。可是只除了看到他跑來跑去而外，郤也沒有佈置什麽歡迎的儀式，倒不知道他用意安在。這是旁觀者的意思。共實介夫自己，關於這樣跑來跑去，也想不到是為了什麽。在十二點鐘以後，可以說是盼望汽車到了沒有。十二點鐘以後，明知汽車是不能到的，何必探望呢？好容易盼到了下午兩點多鐘，前面一陣亂，有　輛汽車畢開到。介夫趕快到前面去打聽，知道是省城派到流關去歡迎的人，押着專員的行李，先到了。據說，藍專員同了兩個代表，在華淸池溫泉洗操去了，還有一兩個鐘頭，才能到呢。這一下，倒很合了介夫的意思，立刻找着那押解行奉的　差，含笑問道，請問，你們藍專　帶了一位裘書記來了嗎？聽差說，不　，有一位裘書記，也在臨潼呢。介夫道：嗐！他先來了就好了。他口裏說着，也就陪了聽差指點安頓行李。聽差以為他是本地官署派來的招待員，自然，也就由　招待，並不　阻。（二九四）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第三，我們這種粉的裏面；雖是為了要不使它易於團結成片的緣故，也像外面一樣的加入鉛粉在內，然而所加的分量是很少很少的，只僅僅乎使它不團起來就得；外面所製的往往一味濫加，以致用的人隔了一年半載，便深受鉛毒，臉色漸漸發起靑來，連皮膚也跟着粗糙了，有幾種甚至會使人的臉在不知不覺中變黑起來；如果在舉行什麽朝與的時侯，我們的臉忽然變了黑色，豈不要　成一椿絕大的笑話！」</p>
<p>太后的幽默的風趣，有時候委實是很有意味的；試想一位莊嚴肅穆的皇太后，在伊的羣臣之前，突然變出了一張黑臉來，兀要笑殺人嗎？我懸想到了這個情景，差一些就要笑出來了，但我祇能忍耐着，那裏敢笑；因為我要是一笑的話，伊就會在鏡子裏瞧到了，也許便要逼着我說明何以好笑的緣故，這樣敎我將如何答復呢？</p>
<p>伊的粉雖然是那樣的考究，但伊却用得很少，不像尋常一般婦女那樣的動輒塗成一張曹操似的白臉；伊祇很薄的敷上一層就算了，大概這也是伊的「美容秘訣」之一。</p>
<p>「我們所用的胭脂」，伊接着又說道：「製造起來，簡直尤比粉來得講究：它們是純粹用玫瑰花的液汁所製成的，玫瑰花汁原算不得是什麽希罕的東西，尋常的胭脂中，用它的儘有；所以我們的特長，又在精選。（三九四）</p>

<h3 id="c157">膂力驚人的蜘蛛 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>你不要以為蜘蛛是節肢動物類中一個小小的東西，它的膂力比了昂藏六尺的大丈夫還要大得多哩。據動物學家說：它體要是長得像人類一樣的大，那麽它定可很容易的把一宅兩上雨下的屋子掮將起來，不算一回事。試問一個昂藏六尺的大丈夫可辦得到麽？所以我們可以肯定的說：蜘蛛的膂力大於人艱。</p>
<p>英京倫敦動物園中，有兩個錫蘭種的大蜘蛛，雄的名極立米，雌的名蘇賽，前年忽然失踪，一連十二個月，杳無消息，大家以為死了，不料一年之後忽又回到動物園來。於是一般人說：這一對蜘蛛夫妻大約是到什麽地方補作蜜月旅行去的，隨後又休養了一陣，方始携手而歸，動物園中的主持人當然是非常歡迎的了。據說它們出走時是頂起了籠上的一塊厚玻璃，道玻璃至少有兩磅的重量，它們倆必須同時用足了力，向上頂起，方能脫身，這兩個蜘蛛本來是產在鍚蘭高山中的，在大樹和巖石的中間結成極大的網，直徑足有五英尺大，而兩頭的絲足有十英尺至十二英尺長，其粗和鉛絲不相上下，像燕雀和雲雀那麼大的鳥類，往往絆住在網上，被它們吃掉，任是人們所害怕的蜥蜴，一着了它們的網，也只得做它們的點心。它們的牙牀異常的堅强有力，好像鳥類的嘴一樣，但是並沒有毒，所以人類是不必怕它們的。</p>
<p>英國有一位有名的動物學家，有一天在一條堤　旁邊散步，見溝中有一個黑色的大蜘蛛，停住在那裏，一動都不動，他見了奇怪，便站住了脚仔細的瞧，却見那蜘蛛正在捉魚，一會兒，已被它咬住了一尾。那魚雖然並不怎樣大，但比它的本身却大到八倍以上。蜘蛛的牙鉗咬着那魚的脊　，緊緊的不放，那魚沒命的掙扎，想把蜘蛛拖下水去，但那蜘蛛的後脚攀住在堤岸上，用力抵抗，那魚終於敵不過它，竟被它抓了起來，慢慢地嚼吃，前後十五分鐘內，便得到了完全的勝利。蜘蛛膂力之大，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>又有一個蜘蛛，它的身體不過係一顆豌豆那麽大，在一株高樹上結着一張網，有一天早上，有一頭一寸半長的小鼠絆在網內，脫身不得，它費了足足有三小時的功夫，把它的絲繞住了鼠尾，越繞越緊，末後竟把那鼠子高高的吊在空中，不用說，又可供它飽餐一頓了。</p>
<p>蜘蛛不但以膂力驚人，並且懂得音樂，懂得最好的音樂。據倫敦動物園中報吿：有一個黑色的大蜘蛛，每聽得無綫電機中奏動名家的樂曲時，它就從藏身的所在爬將出來，蹲在無綫電機的頂上，細細的聽，一面搖動它的身體，好像給那音樂做着節拍一般，到得樂聲停止，它就立刻退回去了。最奇怪的，它只喜歡那些老名家的樂曲，有時聽得無綫電中換上了爵士音樂，它就忙不迭的溜走，分明是表示厭惡的意思。現代的男女在跳舞塲中最喜爵士音樂，不知道欣賞那些老名家的樂曲，似乎不及一個小小的蜘蛛了。呵呵！</p>

<h3 id="c177">批評的兩種傾向 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 靑園</p>
<p>克羅采教授有本名爲「詩與非詩」的批評集子，其中論到歐洲二十六個作家，我們已經從他的名著「美學」中見到他學說的網領了，這本集子可說是他學說之具體的應用。是使我感覺興趣的，是論巴爾扎克的一篇。他因巴爾扎克那種藉社會環境以描寫人類活動的傾向，而兼綸及近代的法國文學批評。他說：「我願把法國心理派或印象派的批評置於教訓主義及系梳化的批評之先，把聖柏甫與拉梅脫置於泰納與布呂納鐵面之先。」爲什麼呢？「就因爲這些後者都是偏重理論，且爲一種智力的及武斷的精神所蔽，而這種精神却構成了理解藝衛的障碍。」他以爲布氏連一點淺顯的道理都不懂，而那種所謂「社會小說」，也不是一種藝術形式，只是一種教條而已。（以上所引均見英譯本）</p>
<p>從他的立論裏，我們看出了兩種不同的批評態度；克氏及其所推崇的拉梅脫等，是傾向於主觀的，印象的，從內心出發以及於外界而解釋文學現象的。至於泰納等人，却是崇尙客觀的，實證的，藉外界環境以說明其對內心活動之影響的。文學批評本可依其本身發展過程分爲主觀的典客觀的兩種，而其發　程度，又是後者高於前者。前者無論怎樣去「自圓其說一，但終免不了不着邊際的談玄意味；後者因急於造系統的結果，雖有時不免將事實遷就理論，受到武斷興機械之識，但那種實證的，解釋的精神，卻往往可與現代最合理的批評暗合，而匯爲新的主流，向科學的完善的境地進軍？前者因爲根基不穩，可以人執一說，而後者則可以事實爲試金石，逐漸批判，裁汰，變革，脩正，而近於衆目共覩的眞理。</p>
<p>克羅采的學說崇尙直觀。主張打破以時代環境爲批許要素的觀念。以爲藝術是自由的創造的，只能就藝術本身而論藝術。然而泰納等人，却與此相反，偏要從藝術的客觀環境上求得解釋，偏以爲文學是進化的，歷史的，不能孤立而架空地存在。因此，他們就不斷地對「爲藝術而藝術」的傾向宣戰了。如果說他們是受了實證哲學進化論及當時自然科學所啟發，那麼克羅采恰表現了對這些學說的「反動」，頗有與法德哲學的生命主義相合之處；出發點不同，當然立論也分道揚鏢，自來走不上一條道路。不過依我之見，泰納一派的流弊，至多是如法國某一些庸俗的文學史家那樣奉泰納的學說爲金科玉律，既不能衡量他學說的利弊，又不能對他學說有進一步的發明，只把匯來文學現象「生硬地」而又一機械地」納入種族時代環境的範疇裏，流爲武斷粗淺。而克羅采等的流弊，則會如美國斯賓甘恩等人那一派認一切表現皆美，力倡創造的批評，空論不着邊際，只在那裏兜理論的闈子。</p>
<p>別的不用提，即以克氏這篇文字而論，其中說到古代的戲劇中，並未超越研究及刻畫普通人性的界限。「但是一到十七世紀與十八世紀之間，社會的鬥爭與變革以及勃興的歷史趣味一方面反響到喜劇上面，使牠表現一定的社會與歷史的環境，另一方面也佔據了小說，使之轉向而成爲「歷史的」及「社會的」小說。」他說巴爾扎克「並不希望把自己限於簡單的觀察，而是要發現社會現象的理由與法則的規範，更進而追跡評價及善，眞，美諸理想的原理。」但這些變革是爲了什麼呢？什麼是這些的「原因」呢？克氏只叙述了這些現象，而沒揭出其潛伏的原因及意義，是不會使人滿意的。老實說，要對這些現象加以明晰的解釋，似乎就得需要客觀的考察，「脚踏實地」地從外界環境的研究上做工夫！</p>
<p>文學批評家朗松在其名著法國文學史上說泰納興布魯納織爾是揭開了批評史之新的一頁的。近代自然科學之偉大的發展也供給了許多方法，使文學批評趨向堅實與確定。對於過去的批評家，捧與駡都是多餘。布呂納鐵哀的立論，在今日看來已是殘破不堪，就是被稱爲最能保持「客觀態度的泰納，其方法的運用不是也終於墮入觀念論的泥淖裏？歷史是進化的，已經有人繼他們而揭開批評史之吏新的一頁了。只有他們那種實事求是地　繹作品相互間的影響及其與客觀環境變遷的關係，却是發前人所未發，足視爲近代批評之先河的。</p>

<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>一個黃昏，我正在寨墻上散步。</p>
<p>突然，隨著風，從什麼地方送來了一種陰慘的呼聲。這聲音悠長而且低沉，彷彿有種物件掩住了呼喚者的喉頸，而他依然在掙扎裏呌囂着。</p>
<p>驚悸的，可怖的那聲音又開始了。像頭一次同樣，宛如被難者的絕命的哀吟，凄迷，傷心；我給激動得瞪圓了眼睛，整個神經系給籠罩住，如同受了什麼力的吸引，我盡情的去尋覔這聲音的由來。</p>
<p>在一個地主的裙房墻外，我立住了。這兒是可以有些新發現的，我想。這是地主們不可少的建築，置位在整個住宅的後一排，骨格不大，可是房間倒挺多，通常是作爲倉庫用的</p>
<p>我樊在一棵樹上，由裙房的小窗裏望進去。一盞陰森的燈掛在壁的中段，它對面，是一個可怕的年輕農夫，他被吊在樑頭上，面色發靑，眼白向著地：</p>
<p>「給我講！給我講出來！趕快講！」</p>
<p>說着說着，在那年輕農夫肩上就是幾鞭！年輕農夫只向他望一望，沒作聲。拿鞭子的人是我們的小寨主，大個兒，一臉橫肉：證實着他是有錢有勢的。</p>
<p>「說啊！我要你自己說！」</p>
<p>又是那麼幾鞭，年輕農夫仍然沉默着，安靜，他並不太息。這更激起小寨主的惱怒了，他揮起皮鞭，又抽將起來，那一副猙獰的面貌，活像一隻野獸！</p>
<p>「您要他說什麼呀？您……」</p>
<p>一個女人，在小寨主的身邊跪下了，她哭泣，說話的聲音顫慄着。她，是這年輕農夫的妻子，在小寨主家作僱傭的女人。本來，他們是租種寨主的土地的，由於年景的歉收，一切耕作全由丈夫擔任下來了。</p>
<p>「我是說……」小寨主有些發窘；女入到底是有魔力的啊，他的語聲立刻轉換了：「我是說，你們欠我的糧食，什麼時候可以還淸呢？」小寨主是想以這些話將女人騙出去的，對於女人突然的到來，他感到異常不安，自然，這於他事情的進行是極不便的。</p>
<p>「大相公啊，」女的懇求著，「我不是跟您說過了嗎，明年麥季一到，準還淸！糊食又不多！」</p>
<p>「你去罷，我馬上就放了他—」小寨主用往日對女人的溫情跟女人說，微笑着，把眼黑移到眼的一角。</p>
<p>「唔。」</p>
<p>女人親眼看見小寨主將自己的丈夫放鬆，纔慢俊走去。她的丈夫，無力地，臃軟在地上，雙目緊閉，呼吸很不調和。</p>
<p>小寨主透露着勝利的神情，那姿態就宛如一個凱旋的騎士。他燃着一隻烟捲，在昏黃的燈光下來回踱着。突地，他改變了顏色，朝年輕農夫後背重重踢一脚：</p>
<p>「你說！你說！你跟人家怎麼說的！」</p>
<p>「……」年輕伙子沒答應。</p>
<p>「你說呵！你敗壞了我的名譽！我　你的娘！你害了我了，我……你給我說呀！」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「你說啊，你這窮，骨頭！我跟你女人怎樣？」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>皮鞭又揮動着了！當他第二鞭剛要落下時，那年輕農夫不知怎的掙斷了繩子，跳起來了。他急速地撲過去，緊指着小寨主的頭頸。</p>
<p>簡直聽不見一絲聲音，他們在地上翻着筋斗，滾着，兩對注滿了怒氣的眼珠子，敵視着在裏面有着火！那隔開了一條宏溝的火！昏慘的燈光在壁上繪描着這兩對火的掙扎的剪影。</p>
<p>「啊……」</p>
<p>這麼地呌一聲小寨主便倒下來了！我看見他的血流，他最後的悸動；恐怖的氣氛包圍了我，從樹又我跌倒在地上，我暈過去！</p>
<p>到第二天，人家吿訴我，小　主給他的女傭刺死，而女傭一是跟他負了傷的丈夫逃了！</p>

<p>— 法國巴爾扎克原著王堅生譯</p>
<p>「你對於母親所說的話，將使問題更趨嚴重。讓我們談談正題吧。「你還要發　嗎？」「是的。」等一分鐘，」他說，的金幣上也　了一個叉叉在上而嗎？這　幣上的叉叉是一個沙丁魚商，當他給錢我們的時候，劃在上面的。　葵斯纔明白過來，他哭起來，——「我們已經說的很多了，」辟說；」我我對於你的過去一切，將一字不提，但是我不願意一個柴勃拉梅家裏人去死在　克　亦錫克的市場中。禱吿一下，我們得快貼了。一分鐘以內，就會有一位修道士來聽你的懺悔。」他的母親已經走開了，她不忍停在那兒親耳聽見她的兒子被人定罪。</p>
<p>當她已經走開時，他的叔叔柴　拉梅領進皮里阿克的一位牧師來；但是葵斯並沒有什麼對他說對他是，個狡滑的人一他知道他的父親對他的不肯懺悔，不至於置他於死地。柴勃拉梅看見了呷葵斯很固執，於是說，「先生，謝謝你，請你原諒我，但是我要給我兒子一大教訓，我請求你對於這件事不要再說什麼，至於你」，他向呷葵斯說「你不見氣的話，——這件事已不能改變了能我毫不猶預地要解决這件事了。他把他送到牀上。孩子相信這話，但他揣想他能够得他的父親諒解，他睡了，他父親看守着。當他看見他的兒子沉沉陲去的時候，他以麻布遮着他的嘴，又用一塊帆布緊緊的繃縛着，最後緊好他的手和足。他發狂了，一他泣血了」，像柴勃拉梅告訴裁判官所說的一樣。你可以想像到他的母親會跪到在他父親的面前求赦。「他是給判决了」！他說，「你要帮助我把他安放在船中」，她拒絕了這要求，柴　拉梅自己把他安放在船中，强迫他到船底下面，繫好一塊石頭在他的頸上。於是他划出了小灣——一直划出海面，到他現在坐的那盤石地方。那時候可憐的母親，曾經要求她的夫弟，把她帶到那裏，她儘着嗓子高呌着：「慈悲！但毫無效果。這是一個月夜，她看見她的丈夫把他倆的兒子摔　在大海中。大海中是風恬浪靜的，她只有聽見水濺聲，接着什麼也沒有了，沒有蹤跡，沒有水泡。不，大海是不洩露任何秘密的，柴勃拉梅登岸後，撫慰他妻子的呻吟，但是她已經半死了，兄弟一人，帶她同去是不可能的，他們迫不得已只好把她安放在剛綫載他兒子用的小船中，沿着，克羅亦錫克的水道深處搖划着。啊！這位美麗的勃蘭族人不到　一禮拜就離開這世界了。臨終時，她還請求她的丈夫，把那隻可咒詛的小船焚燒掉。他也照辦了。爲了他的兒子，他一切都吿終了，他不知道他自己還需求什麼。當他散步時，他好像一個不勝酒力的人站立不穩，於是他出遊了十天，當他回來的時候，就坐在你們看見他的地方。自從他坐在那裏，他沒有說過一句話。</p>

<p>「我昨天又做了一首詩，這個……」他說。</p>
<p>「哦？」蒼白臉的嘴角含着笑，又掉過臉來，半張開嘴唇。他見主人的嘴唇在顫動，以爲就要唸出來了，他的頭便俯下來對着主人的嘴唇不知不覺地在頸子上咏味地搖了兩搖。</p>
<p>「不，不，……不唸吧。」主人又忽然自言自語地。「其實讀了你的那首「碰這一盃吧！」那我的是應該燒掉了……」</p>
<p>「哪里哪里。」蒼白臉連連的說；感動得脚步都有點飄飄起來。他望了望主人，便很誠墾地伸出一隻細指的手掌輕輕在主人的肩頭拍了兩拍。「你議虛呵，你謙虛阿！其實我早就說過，我這些詩人中，只有你是最有希望。我，其實是快要所謂明日黃花「的了」說完，他立刻很滿意自己這說話的修辭，既沒有太抬高了別人，也沒有太　下了自己，是很合於中庸之道的。他的嘴邊便露出一個微笑。</p>
<p>但主人也感動了，臉發出油光，兩顴幾乎快要和他的嘴唇一樣的紅，兩眼的光就簡直在發閃。但他鎮靜着，立刻向蒼白臉瞥一眼說道：</p>
<p>「這倒確是你的謙虛。我們荷花詩社的朋友們就常常說，現在中國的詩人，除了你，還有誰？」</p>
<p>蒼白臉這下子好象喝下一大盅葡萄酒，完全陶醉了，兩眼簡直發熱，飄飄的兩脚，踏着水門汀的地簡直好象踏的是絨的地毯。跨進一個門框，迎面架立在兩丈遠的壁下的穿衣鏡，亮着淸永一航的白光，就淸楚地照見昂頭走在油光頭髪主人前面的自己的影子；蒼白臉兩觀發紅，額角閃着油光，穿着一件淺藍色花綢單衫的長條身架，長條得兩肩都向削，藍綢衫的下　簡直輕飄飄地在自己的兩腿前豁朗地閃動。他深深地向着這自覺很風流瀟洒的影子盯一眼，連自己都覺得非常可愛。但鏡子一晃地就落在身后了，可是總覺得被它吸引着似的要把他的頭拉過去；但他忍耐住，忍耐住；但終於回過頭去，可是只能看見那直立着的鏡框的側面。等到主人向他伸伸手，又指着面前的一個長胖臉和一個圓胖臉時，他才出驚地仔細一看，原來自己在客廳里了。</p>
<p>「這是王老板。這是劉老板。」主人說。</p>
<p>長胖臉和圓胖臉立刻揑起拳頭連連拱手。</p>
<p>「呵呵，久仰久仰！」長胖臉說。</p>
<p>「呵呵，久仰久仰！其實我們那次在黃先生那塊會過的」。圓胖臉說。</p>
<p>蒼白臉一驚地兩手掌在兩腿邊動一下，「是不是舉起來？他很快地這麼一想，但也終於舉了起來，不自然地揑着拳頭拱了一拱。</p>
<p>「呵呵，」他說，耳根頭就突然發紅，紅到兩頰。</p>
<p>主人向蒼白臉看一眼，馬上記起蒼白臉剛才說過的話。</p>
<p>「呵，該死！我怎麼把他弄到生意人的面前……」他於是立刻向着蒼白臉的胸部伸開兩手，做着要擁抱似的姿式說道</p>
<p>「呵，密斯特黃他們有幾首詩在我這里，請你給他們批評批評如何，啊？到那邊去？」</p>
<p>「呵呵，」蒼白臉微笑地說，當他向主人掉過臉來的那一剎那，眼光就在圓胖臉上停了一秒鐘，看他是否在閃動着仰慕的眼光或者張開了吃驚的嘴唇</p>
<p>圓胖臉也仲出兩手來了，十根胖指伸直，身子一閃的踱開兩步，手就也擁抱似地對着空出來的椅子笑道：</p>
<p>「呵，就請坐在這塊吧。坐吧。不是外人。不客氣。」</p>
<p>「唉，唉，」蒼白臉點一點頭說。「不客氣，不客氣。「</p>
<p>主人就請蒼白臉向穿衣鏡那邊走去，當他兩個並肩經過屋當中，那擺有一個花瓶，鋪有一張白布的圓棹子旁邊的時候，在背后就響着那兩個胖臉的聲首：</p>
<p>「唉唉，眞是不要再說了，今年的生意！我剛才說過的那一批貨，昨天是三兩二，今天一下子就跌到三兩，……」</p>

<p>落日把一道耀人的光圈，橫掃到廣闊的林塲的草坪上，地上把白楊的暗影，也隨着拉得長長的；人行道兩邊的女貞與刺柏，有秩序地交錯着四行粗闊的綫條；一叢叢毛葉松的倒影，松鼠似地爬着；柳葉凌亂地　搖着，似乎這龐大的堆花的地毯下有什麼東西在掀動作怪似的，……剛出水的微紅的荷花的菩蕾，在山陰下，在無數的碧綠的荷葉叢中嬌喘着。隱在馬路兩旁的楓楊與法國梧桐樹蔭裏的街燈，也開始閃鑠出黃黃的光芒了。</p>
<p>這時候，康雨，李宓與柯諒夫是照例吃過晚飯了，就照例地吩咐茶役把籐椅與茶几搬到革坪上，還打了一壺白茶與一壺綠茶，去迎着夜的幕帷，從寫窿的上蒼拋擲來下。</p>
<p>「小康，吃過飯了？「是一個姓實的浙江口昔的照呼；有時還會有一個便便大腹的中年人一路來，但不是常時的在坐定以後，照例地談些柯諒夫所尙未理解的各人點過戲的對象，在一陣滿足的歡笑之後，大家打着九尾龜上學來的够作嘔的蘇白：窩心得來！」</p>
<p>接着：是小李拉直了腔子，哼一　犂　或京了音。</p>
<p>這樣，靜寂的黃昏就熱鬧起來了。祗有柯諒夫一個人是呆呆的，因爲他對於大鼓委實是門外漢。這樣，他就獨個子抬着頭，寂寂的默察着自然的周遭。</p>
<p>上弦的月，已掛在山凹裏；她的衛星，也閃鑠地追隨着出現了；火樣的晚霞，已換上靑灰的密集的雲；遠近的山，都套上了的晚服；飛螢流星似地閃曜；他所唯一認識的GreatDipper的斗柄也逐一淸晰地刻劃出來了。荷塘裏的青蛀，應着這裏的掌聲一樣，不斷地「閣哇，閣哇」鼓噪着……</p>
<p>小李的嗓子是愈吊愈響朗了，而且開始唱流水板的駡操了。然而京戲對於柯諒夫却仍然一點也不能理解的。而童與康似乎也轉移了他們的興趣，在低談着他們的美芬與美英了，這就使柯諒夫不得不依然靜靜的看着天。</p>
<p>銀河的光帶，巳淸析地橫貫天際，金牛座在他的頭頂閃鑠，熱的絲絨的幕帷，是魚網似的撒下來了。樹端加上了大米畫似的黑點，遠山的綫條也已朦朧，遠處的點點的電的火，也透射出來，而我們這一羣，又換了一個話題，又在洶洶不斷地說笑着了。</p>

<p>今後子女婚嫁問題，其責任自當歸之於子女，已如前文所述，但現在究竟還是過波時代，人家子弟，大抵在學校中多受相當教育，或在社會上習相當職業，與異性接觸的時間較多，自由結婚，比較容易，若女子因家庭舊禮教的束握，有延師在家訓讀者，有恐女兒在外讀書，或發生不端行爲，因而輟學者，卽有在校讀書，亦因爲舊禮教的觀念，深印腦筋，還有「羞人答答怎好見母親」之概，若輩女兒，本來沒有自由的能力，祇有父兄來介紹，或作主，惟此種女子，只有現在的過渡時代還有，過此以往，必定漸漸地都要同化。</p>
<p>其次，自由的結婚流弊至多，從前專制婚姻，離婚案件，不大發生，現在自由結婚，而離婚的案件，竟如雨後春筍，結婚易則離婚亦易，原是一定不易的原理，在理爲父兄者，平時有相當的指導，臨時有同意的責權，但以事實言之，男女之間，既到了熱烈戀愛的程度，父兄的同意和不同意，完全等於具文。</p>
<p>或謂男女智識程度既高，則决擇之間，亦自有相當的能力，不致爲人所愚，這也有不盡然者，例如前日報載貝爾格勒電，馬尼亞在五年之中，要了八十個妻，我想外國女子的智識，必定較中國女子爲高，並且在此八十位女郎之中，必定有幾位學問很高深的，可以斷言，然而也不免爲欺，此種情形，當亦可見，反之，或有如馬尼亞的女子，則男子安有不受其欺騙之理，此種弊端，在自由結婚的信念中，原是難免的。</p>
<p>以上問題，似乎談得太遠，和子女婚嫁問題的責任無關，但是亦極有關係，因爲父母既不負子女婚嫁問題的責任，則一切因婚嫁以後而發生不幸的結果，在父母亦可不必負其責任，則子女對於婚嫁問題，自己亦得稍爲注意。</p>
<p>總之，現在社交既經公開，女子既經解放，則男女之間，本來不成問題，而現在的人，還有以風化問題爲社會上極要的問題者，莫不戰時代之潮流矣。</p>
<h3 id="c183">秋雨小曲 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>小船兒輕輕地在笑縐了臉的河面上滑過。</p>
<p>艙外——雨霏霏的下着。</p>
<p>秋天了。</p>
<p>這應當說是秋雨呢。</p>
<p>度過了那下着秋雨的季節，便又是一切都歸入於沈寂的冬天了。</p>
<p>人，躱在那湫隘的狹窄的艙裏，情緒是沈鬱的。心坎上，不自覺地染上一派黯澹的輕愁之感。像那濛濛的秋雨，給遠近的小林，連綿的山岡，古老的城墻，染上了一層迷茫的灰色似的。</p>
<p>從什麼時候起，我懂得憂鬱的可愛，可記不淸了。然而，一到秋天，那抑在心頭上的窒息似的幽悶，就隨着秋風一同來臨了。一方面覺得它可愛，一方面又感到有一種失望之餘的恨惱。</p>
<p>「夏天，我每晚都做着夢。現在夏天完了，那些夢是隨着那夏天最後的玫瑰而消逝了。</p>
<p>「朋友，你應該知道的，我是怎麼地惋惜着我的靑春的過去呵。</p>
<p>「今兒，更加是黯然啦。</p>
<p>「——怎麼你這樣的消沈呢？</p>
<p>「我不能回答你的問話；難道你也不了解我麼？</p>
<p>「於是，想起自家，今夜，我將爲這而失眠了。」</p>
<p>想起寫在朋友手冊上的話，只好楞着眼珠子，展着憂鬱的苦笑。我們之間，是有着特殊的情感的；所以我把蘊　在心底深處的熱情也掬出來了。</p>
<p>可是，有那一個能够比自己更加了解自己的呢！</p>
<p>在夏天，我到處感到憎恨，煩惱，怨慕，和種種的不樂意。以爲到了秋天，那時侯，天氣凉爽了，屈在悒鬱裏邊的心，便可在天高氣爽的秋天之下，過些歡愉的日子啦。</p>
<p>但，畢竟失望了。</p>
<p>我是永遠不會覺得希罕的，失望緊隨着希望之降臨到我的身上。希冀，泡影，在我看來，正像花開花落一般地平淡。自從懂事之後，悠長的一大串的日子，在那失望的情緒裏邊，自家拿希望來欺騙自己，度過了春天，又度過了秋天。</p>
<p>有時，在夜靜裏，凝望着潔凈的美麗得像深藍色的天鵝絨一般的天空，月亮穿雲走着。心裏就會想起：當眞的這樣不停地走着，到底到什麼時候才完結呢？——這是不能得到解答的問題哪</p>
<p>黃昏的蒼茫，秋雨的朦朧，天是更加暗下去了。</p>
<p>今夜，又是看不到月亮的天色哪。——我想着。心坎上像吹了一陣冷風似的？……</p>
<p>艙外——雨霏霏的下着。</p>
<p>秋天了。</p>

<p>— 金光</p>
<p>一陣晚風，吹濃了秋的凄凉，恐懼的落葉聲，撥動了各人寒慄的心；小孩子們都緊偎在母親的臂懷裏，作無聲的抖顫；老人們乏力的身子，也靠在壯年人的肩頭，只是一陣陣帶病的呻吟，刺痛着同伴們的心。幾天來趕夜路的經騐，把他們訓練得很鎮靜了，沒有吵鬧，沒有叫怕，更沒有怨恨，只是人相挨着人，心相繫着心，默默地嚴肅地，在恐怖的夜的森林裏，作沒歸宿的奔投。</p>
<p>路雖然是陌生的，可是在他們的脚下還是沒盡頭的延長着。——人又似一羣沒歸宿的烏鴉。</p>
<p>是漆黑的一團；沒有月光，沒有火光，沒有一點的光；人像走在黑暗的地獄裏一般，除了能看見自己半個身子以外，就看不見旁的東西了，除了能聽到自己急促的呼吸外，也只能聽見旁人的呼吸了，許多人支撑不住。心裏都叫起『停了吧！停了吧，一樣是不能活了！』只是不肯說出口來；到底他們想到後面是吞人的洪濤，和黑暗中魑魅可怕的爪牙，於是就重新掙扎起，跟着大夥兒一同走，麻木的腿似乎也不覺得怎樣了。</p>
<p>在第二天的黃昏，他們才趕到一個古鎮；靜靜的，荒凉的，吿訴他們亦是一羣緊迫在飢寒凄凉裏的人物。</p>
<p>寥寥梟梟的炊烟，牽動了一串飢困的目光，他們不禁搖了一下空洞洞的吐子，咽了一口沾着灰塵的唾沫。</p>
<p>可是那村莊裏的人們，早就從滿染征塵的服裝上，知道了他們的來歷；一張一張兜着陰影的險皮上，探得了他們的情况；不待他們開口，就對他們說：</p>
<p>『年頭不好，沒有能力留你們在鎮上。』</p>
<p>一陣嘆息，黃昏更加了蒼茫；一步一步的，他們仍向潛伏的黑暗裏趕去；又走過一個異鄉了！</p>
<p>一重山又一重山，一道水又一道水，一個一個的村莊，在他們疲憊的脚底下過去了；他們作了無歸宿的奔投。——他們是一羣無家可歸的難民。</p>
<h3 id="c185">朦朧間 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>蹩出房門的時侯並沒看過時計，從麻雀在黃葉子堆上嚕嘈着的神氣裏，覺得還很早，奶白色的天空嵌着幾塊淡灰的雲霓，氣候很凉快，一陣風擁來一陣雨，風過了的時候雨也停止了。我披了玄色的雨斗篷，咬着烟咀，被一隻黃色黑點的蜻蜓導引着，穿過竹林，又穿過夾在柳樹行列中的用瓦爿嵌着花紋的小道，道上十生長着薄薄的靑苔，雖很徵細，却富有欣然之氣，不象那竹葉，洋楓，柳枝，受不了雨水的沾壓和風的吹刮，都低低地下垂，而呈現着疲乏的姿態了。</p>
<p>每天小坐的地方總是在湖邊，閒眺那碧浪和靑山……</p>
<p>可是，今天的景色又不同了，雨後吧，靑山沒有了，碧浪沒有了，遠遠的飄蕩着的棕色風帆也沒有了，從那叢劃長在湖面的蘆葦起，只是一大片白茫茫的矇矓境域，假使一個不曾到過此地的游覽者，他一定以爲在矇矓間有着廣闊而遠大的前程，或者那邊是一片翠綠的平原，而决不會料到前面的酒霧中隱藏着高山，削壁，奇岩怪石，幽深的洞穴和長滿銳刺的荆棘。船家是不歡喜這矇朧的湖面的，他們怕把船搖錯了方向，而致誤觸隱埋於水中的山之餘脈的礁石。我瞧着兩兩三三的桅船小心翼翼地緊靠湖灘淌過去，一些沒有聲息，湖水平穩而泛着白色光，如將凝固的凉粉，充份地流露着生之寂寞。</p>
<p>我坐在一塊帶潮的石上，輕輕地噴出一口烟，從忽而漲大忽而炸滅的烟圈中，悄悄地帶來了幽冥的思潮：</p>
<p>「自己的生活也常常被遮掩於朦矓間，使我不能認識眞實，世面與罪惡，我不能把生存的意義和思想的中心反映出來，而又很膽怯地捧着一顆柔弱的心，一步一步地踱在生之旅程的邊緣。我怕悮蹈罪惡之窟，怕觸陰損的礁石，又怕錯走了生活大路的方向。「謹愼」常常被譏爲「懦弱」，然而偶然膽大一點，便會受到那種「道德」的讉責，於是，眼前就更朦矓起來了。我索性閉起眼睛糊塗地過着，糊塗地讓尊貴的光陰如水般的流過去嗎？」……</p>
<p>記得住在都市裏，早晨，傍晚，或者陰雨天，走上屋頂的曬臺，遙望週遭，那點紅色的屋頂，灰色的高樓，黑鐵烟囱，年紅燈塔，縱橫的電綫…請昧地隱藏於烟霧裏而幻成一片矇矓；旺烈的食慾，兇險的陰謀，淫靡，瘋狂，罪惡：一切都被遮掩了，因此，往往很容易使人想到白雲仙境上去，感覺着生之境域的寬曠而愉快，然而，這究竟還是烟幕，烟幕的後面有重磅的炸彈在着！因此，我對於朦矓的一剎，並不能如詩人畫家般的看了滿意。</p>
<p>担任在園裏看夜的那個伙計拖着沉重的步子過去了，一點剛被丟掉的烟蒂的星火給踏熄，一粒黑色螞蟻跟着打扁扁的烟蒂上爬過。我爲這粒螞蟻而慶幸，可是，天氣却仍那　陰沉，湖面却仍那麼朦矓，我不禁又對眼前的境况起了暗然之戚。我渴望着的碧浪和靑山？…</p>

<p>袁美雲嚇得叫猪玀　關胖子大唱王寳川</p>
<p>卜萬蒼導濱聲片「凱歌」，前天大隊出發到杭州諸暨拍外景，昨接隨從之劇務主任陳麟書來信，報吿沿途情形，頗多噱頭，錄之以博一粲。</p>
<p>我們的「　歌」外景隊，由上海梵學渡趁九點三十分快車，到達杭州已經是下午三點半了，便包定五輛汽車，馳到南星橋江畔，再包定直達諸暨之小火輪，於晚間十一點半到卜先生友人潘君住宅，工作地點即在是處，這裏有一段路途中的小小報吿。</p>
<p>起程日，正是聶耳在上海金城開追悼會，我們爲工作不能參加，當然很不安，但是，在船上，袁美雲，王引，姜修，劉犂，金毅，葛愛娜等，爲表示追悼這前進作曲家的精神起見，合唱聶耳作曲之「逃亡歌」，正這時適經臨浦小鎮，忽見電光四起，我們狠覺奇異，便問船夫，始知盂蘭會在超波陰魂。</p>
<p>那時卜先生發言，每人須靜默默一分鐘，以誌哀悼，過後，因潮水高漲，幾與橋樑相並，船不能過去，於是停泊岸旁，各人伸首遙望，只見幢幢黑影，而草木悉素之聲，使人不寒而慄，至此袁美雲最先逃入艙內，其餘也陸續進艙，而岸旁哇嗚，其聲咯咯。阿木尼亞說赤老來矣，嚇得袁美雲大呌「猪猥」。</p>
<p>在艙內因悶無事幹，秦桐乃仿唱袁美雲在「凱歌」中所唱之「採蓮歌」，張翼德唱花旦，令人肌肉跳動，而秦桐胃口甚好，不自覺也，欖有關宏達趙突山合唱「投軍別　」，關飾王寳川，趙節薛薛平貴，有唱在做，較之聽自由舞裏」滑稽多多，衆人捧腹絕倒，再有吳蔚雲，顧宗義，珠連璧合唱「馬浪蕩」和「小孤孀」，全本蘇腔，呌人笑出眼淚。</p>
<p>今日（十七）上午卜吳找看外景，下午拍戲，夜間飛機特多，帳子失其效用，輾轉不能、眠，大約是杭州有航空學校的緣故吧。</p>
<p>此次出發人數五十八人，期約一月，可能返甲，大小行旅百餘件，及戲中所用抽水機十輛，皮帶等及「打漁　家」全副服裝，塲面偉大之至。</p>
<p>肚內貨色已差不多明天再報吿。</p>

<p>築地本願寺的建築</p>
<p>與上述有連帶關係，最後且就最近重修工竣的築地本廟寺一說。這個建築，實為我受本廟寺的委託而設計的，今再在此加以說明，這無論如何有點不相稱，祗好請大家宥恕一下。當初我依照該寺的願望，作純日本式與印度式兩種設計。經該寺當局愼重審議的結果，才選定印度式。根據上面所略述過的理由及岡案的要求關係，我亦覺印度式爲較佳。在此，我是盡善竟以求其實現的。因爲此乃素無前例的新嘗試，當然豫想得到會成爲建築界一大問題。果然，各方面毀譽褒貶之聲大起，對此惟有感謝。但其中不少誤解之點，頗覺有加以說明的必要。</p>
<p>有人說那個建築是現代式的華麗建築；有人則評爲頗與尼古拉教堂相似；有人則覺得在回式（Saracenio）及印度式中並無此種式樣；某雜誌則譏該設計者爲不知回式與印度式的區別。於此，我無用一一細說，祇思簡單一言。第一，是說與尼古拉教堂的關係：尼古拉教堂的建築，被稱爲「俄國東羅馬式」。東羅馬式是含有濃厚的東方色彩。此東方色彩，以波斯爲主，更遠溯源至印度。卽是說，尼古拉教堂的樣式，骨子裏當然有印度式的風味潛在。故將兩者看做互相形似，並不是眼力不好。</p>
<p>其次，將本願寺的　　誤認作回式建築，並不是毫無理由。原來回式建初發源於阿拉伯方面，其後受回教興盛及東羅馬與波斯等東洋建築的影饗，方達大成。但印度美術史研究的權威者哈烏額爾氏說回式建築受印度建築影響之處頗多。總之，回式建築與古代印度式建築之間，是一脈相通的。故近代回式建築與印度式建築間，往往互相混淆，殊難區別。本願寺的建築，是以古代印度式爲底本，但細加玩味其許多近代的手工，則極易誤爲回式這是事實。</p>
<p>其次，就根本上說，有不少人加以非難，以爲本願寺選取印度式爲下策，這是意見的不同使然。如前所述，遠溯佛教的根源而依據印度式，則從理論上，材料構造上，華麗的性質上，工費的關係上，皆至爲適當。但我亦並非說日本全國各宗派各種佛教建築悉取印度式皆爲適當的。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c196">從建築藝術說到希臘的神廟（七） <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 孫宗文</p>
<p>——世界建集史蹟上最光榮的一頁——</p>
<p>（四）希臘神廟之雕刻與色彩</p>
<p>希臘建築美術之著名於世界，還因其建築物上雕刻美的關係；原來希臘的雕刻藝術，在世界的美術史上，亦是光榮燦爛的一頁藝術史，佔有一極重要之地位。當希臘人設計一建築物時，建築師與雕刻師互相合作，因之其出產品就呈調和的精神，沒有惡劣的作品出現了。又因建築材料大半係採用極美麗悅目之石塊，如大理石等，加以希臘雕刻師用他們熟練的技術，精心作成；那他們的神廟，何怪乎要受世人的崇拜了啊！</p>
<p>希臘神廟上，其雕刻最注重的地方，爲PedimentMatope及Freize等處；雕刻之故事，大多述此廟內所供神的一生之故事，或種族與神之作戰等事蹟；其最普通的，雕刻最多的故事，則爲半人半馬之動物Centaurus與Lapitha。民族作戰之狀况。其他亦因時因地而異，然雕刻之技術總是很精巧的。當時希臘之名雕刻師，則有斐狄阿斯Pbeidias及斯高潑斯Scopas二人最著名於世界。二人之作風，各自獨成一派，而尤以後者之作品最含有時意的，並尤一能代表出當時民族性之一斑。前者之代表作則爲派生登神廟ParthenonTemfle，後者之代表作，則有愛尼克神廟LonicTemple；其神廟前者爲世界建築史上挺著名的一座，後者却爲世界七大奇物之一。其二者建築物之偉大，足可代表這二位雕刻師技藝之高超。同樣亦足可代表當時希臘藝術之最高點。因他們二位雕刻藝術家之出現，足使當時堂皇的神廟，更添一層魔力。</p>
<p>建築物之調和與否與建築物的美觀上很有關係。所謂「調和」Harmonec卽一，形式之調和，二，色彩之調和。前者前面已述及，後者卽爲現在所要談的。</p>
<p>希臘神廟其對於色彩之調和，亦很注重；因他們常將肉色的大理石如Penteric及Parian大理石公司，在其上雕刻成風景，人物，因其材料色彩之美麗文雅故其作品亦呈調和的精神了。又我們知道在沒有文化程度之人民，總喜歡用深的，觸目的，極强的，色彩施於建築物上，如紅，藍，等色，在上古有好多神廟是如此情形的；然希臘的神廟，雖因遺風及風俗之關係，但對於色彩上講的確進步了不少。他們大多將色彩塗的緊要之部份，如深處爲遠地所不能見到的，卽塗以淡的色彩於其上；如此不致將因有的雕刻美消滅了。總之，他們寫處以合乎「美」爲唯一之條件。因其色彩之妍美，材料之珍奇，那何怪乎他們的神廟要令人驚奇不止了呢！</p>
<p>基上結論，則我們可知希臘之神廟，的確够偉大的，纖麗的，珍奇的，在世界的建築藝術史上，的確是最光明燦爛的一頁史蹟！其建築藝術在技巧上之偉大，實足與人以異樣的印象；使每一個從業於建築事業的人永遠所忘不掉的一頁紀念史蹟，在我們的腦海裏。但是挺可惜的一件事因由於年代之久遠，以及歷代史事之變遷，故在歷史上最著名的幾座神廟，到現在皆已毀滅無存了！卽使有，也不過是神廟上之零碎雕刻部份現尙存於英倫古物館中，徒給人家紀念一下，憑吊一下而已！但是，世界上的一切事情，又何嘗不如此呢？！（完）</p>

<p>第八章　鋅</p>
<p>第一節　鋅之概述</p>
<p>鋅因其在金屬狀態時，富於活動，一故礦苗無有單獨者，其普通常化成硫化鋅而埋藏，故所有鋅礦，均爲硫化物類。</p>
<p>第二節　鋅之鍊製</p>
<p>鋅之鍊製，亦分有兩種方法，曰罇化法與電解法。</p>
<p>（一）罇化法—用曲脛罇一具，系製白磁砂，罇內安置煤粉及鋅礦細末，通常安放之成份，煤粉佔百分之四十至七十五，而煤粉之取材以白煤用他種無烟煤爲佳。和合後，共同加熱於罇外，加熱燒煤，煤氣或其他燃料均可。與罇相連者，有磁質空氣冷却器一座，及生鐵冷凝箱一只，當鋅自罇中蒸溜氣化後，經此一箱，可凝成液體，而自箱底流出，卽可取用。</p>
<p>（二）電解法！先將礦苗悶燒，練過一番，加入硫酸，可放去一部流質，化成二氣化硫而散去，而鋅電子乃自硫酸鋅中還原附於鐵板。而且硫璜鐵礦相混，可用磁石以此種物質，分成兩部，其含有氣化鋅之一部，可投入硫酸中再津，得成硫酸鋅溶液此種含有酸性之溶液中，再以不含氣化鋅之一部和入，又可中和，經此中和之化學變化，鐵質乃化成氫氧化鐵而自動沉澱，同時如砒矽銻砂等雜雜，亦可一同下沉，於是純鋅之鋅乃盡附於電極板上，而可取用矣。</p>
<p>第三節　鋅之性能及應用</p>
<p>鋅色灰白，可不受空氣及水份之侵蝕，且極易導電，富於展性，惟抵抗能力則幷不强大。其鑄鋅之最高抵抗力能僅每方英吋九〇〇〇磅，若捲切者，則亦僅每方吋二四〇〇〇磅，而伸縮限度則每方吋僅五〇〇〇磅耳。</p>
<p>鋅之用途，其對於建築界也可做合金，可塗於鐵皮表面，成白鐵皮，充舖屋頂之用。　（第八章完）</p>
<h3 id="c198">建築史話（四） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>可是，一哥德式復活」也是有的。如華爾波耳（HoraceWalpole）及畢克福特（Backford）一流人物，固然是很熱誠的，但不是很了解的；他們替自己建造怪異的房屋。雖然尖頂和屋頂承塵大抵採用板條和灰泥，木造的窗飾常藉塗漆模擬石造，但在他們的期望中，這些房屋的面目倒是合於正確的中古式的。固然，在這些建築物中，有笨拙的小窗門，有脆弱的古怪形式的屋子，有冷靜的石頭走廊，但這樣的浪漫式的房屋却逐漸流行。就是在目前，英國人還未曾從這流行病恢復過來；試看今日英國人的房屋依然離不掉如小尖塔之類的點綴。</p>
<p>這樣，在同時，甚至在同地，你會發見一座房屋是屬於晚近的古典式的，另一座是屬於偽造的哥德式的，也許有第三座是這二者混合而成的。這是建築的「混亂時期」（MuddleAgess）。現在，我們仍然留在這時期中，但同時我們正在努力於脫離這時期。</p>
<p>大概在五十年以前，大多數人都被這「混亂」所包圍，貪懶地摹仿這個或那個，無意設計爲實際生活所需要的建築—這是正當的建築。</p>
<p>後來，菲力浦·威勃（PhilipWbb）和繼起的諾曼諾·蕭（NormanShaw）想到：回復到英國建築在這些各異的「復活」破除傳統以前已經達到的標點似乎是很聽明的辦法。那就是十八世紀中葉的建築，卽Georgian建築。這建築式逐漸流行起來，因此五十年來的上等英國建築都屬於這復活的英國古典式及其新的變式。現在，有許多優美的建築師，如路脫顏斯（SirEdwinLutyens）之流，不憚以他們自已的方式解决新的問題，雖然他們大多數是以十八世紀的風尙爲他們的新計劃的根據的。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who was in Sichuan overseeing the suppression of the Red bandits, flew back to the capital at 5:00 PM on the 19th. Chairman Chiang had flown from Chengdu to Xun on the morning of the 14th with Soong Mei-ling, Chen Bulei, Mao Qingxiang, He Yun, and guards, arriving in the afternoon. He then traveled to Guling to pay respects to Chairman Lin and met with Kong Xiangxi, Soong Ziwen, and others, resting in the mountains for five days. On the 19th, at 1:00 PM, he descended the mountain to Xun. Except for Chen Bulei, who took a boat east, Chairman Chiang and his wife, along with Mao Qingxiang and He Yun, boarded three Ford aircraft and departed for Nanjing at 3:00 PM. Around 5:00 PM, the three planes landed successively at Ming Palace Airport. The airport was heavily guarded by military police. Dozens of people, including Zhu Jiahua, Chen Tiaoyuan, Zhang Daofan, Yu Feipeng, Cao Haosen, Gu Zhenglun, Yao Cong, Xiong Bin, Jiao Yitang, and Peng Yangguang, were present to welcome them. Chairman Chiang, wearing a gray silk long gown and black leather shoes, looked radiant. After disembarking and nodding to the welcoming party, he returned to his official residence at the military academy to rest. Chen Tiaoyuan, Gu Zhenglun, Cao Haosen, Ma Chaojun, and others followed to pay their respects and departed after a brief conversation. That evening, he met with Zhang Qun for discussions. Chairman Chiang had left Nanjing westward in January. After brief stays in Guling, Nanchang, Hankou, and other places, he flew to Chongqing on March 2nd and then went to Guizhou and Yunnan for inspection, overseeing the suppression of the remaining Red bandits, ultimately pacifying the remnants in both provinces. He returned to Chongqing from Guizhou on May 25th and flew to Chengdu on the 26th, staying there until now. The remaining Red bandits in Sichuan Province have been largely eliminated. Chairman Chiang has worked diligently for half a year, traveling tens of thousands of miles, serving the country diligently, and enduring hardships. Now that he has been away from Nanjing for more than half a year, he is making a special trip back to Nanjing to inspect everything. After Chiang arrived in Nanjing, it was widely rumored in political circles that President Wang Jingwei would come to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang after having his health checked in Shanghai.

<p>Zhang Qun Says Wang Jingwei Has Abandoned Resignation Intentions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke and Zhang Qun arrived in Nanjing at 11:15 AM on the 19th aboard a Savoia aircraft from Qingdao. Jiao Yitang, Liang Hancao, Ma Chaojun, Gu Zhenglun, Wang Shufang, and Chen Jianru were at the airport to welcome them. After disembarking, Sun took a car to his private residence in the mausoleum area to rest. Zhang accompanied Gu Zhenglun to a certain location to discuss important matters. Sun met with reporters at his residence, stating, "I flew to Nanjing with Zhang Yuejun at 8:30 AM on the 19th. President Wang was still at the airport waiting for his plane when we left Qingdao, scheduled to fly to Shanghai at 9:00 AM. His illness is gradually improving. After the earnest persuasion of various important figures from the Central Government, although he did not explicitly express his intention to resign, it is hoped that he will drop the matter. The Central Government had previously sent a telegram urging me to accompany Wang south, but Wang insisted that the Central Government approve his resignation before agreeing to move, so it did not materialize. But this matter is now in the past." When asked about the exchange of opinions with Wang and Zhang in Qingdao, Sun replied that the content was not convenient to disclose. When asked whether Hu Hanmin and Wang Chonghui had set a date to return to the country, Sun said that he had not received any telegrams from Hu and Wang recently, so he had no way of knowing. Finally, he mentioned that the Legislative Yuan's plenary session had decided to continue on the 30th, and the successor to the chairman of the Legal System Committee would be determined after the meeting. He also said that he had no intention of visiting Chairman Lin in Lushan recently. According to Zhang Qun, he told reporters at the airport that he was representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in flying to Qingdao to comfort Wang's illness and convey his sincere intention to retain him. Wang's intention to resign has now been dispelled, and he is scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Qingdao on the morning of the 19th to enter the hospital for a physical examination. He will be able to return to Nanjing in the near future. I will stay in Nanjing for a short time and then fly west to report back. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">The Financial Crisis in Eastern Zhejiang <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Since the collapse of Yuan Yu Bank in Hankou, various firms in Ningbo have suffered losses of approximately 800,000 yuan. A small number of financially unsound private banks are experiencing difficulties in turning over funds due to runs on deposits. As of the 29th of last month, Da Tong Heng Yuan and Xin Yuan, two private banks, first announced suspension of payments. Following this, three more large and small private banks, including Yong Yuan, Tai Yuan, and Wu Yuan, also suspended operations simultaneously. In less than a few days, a total of twenty-eight private banks, both large and small, have suspended payments or collapsed, accounting for one-third of the total number of private banks in the port. Not only could the various firms lacking funds not maintain operations, but many firms with ample funds were also affected and suspended operations. On the afternoon of August 3rd, the exchange suspended trading, and all private banks also temporarily suspended receipt and transfer of funds. Although the local political and business authorities in the port convened an emergency meeting overnight and decided that various banks would suspend receiving over-the-counter deposits, restrict withdrawals to 100 yuan, and only allow transfers beyond that amount, and also negotiated with the Bank of Communications, the Central Bank, and the Bank of China to borrow 2 million yuan for relief, the government also forced shareholders of the suspended banks to contribute capital to resume operations, and the turmoil gradually subsided. However, in the past half-month, there have been reports of large and small private banks suspending payments due to poor turnover. According to recent records, the number of large and small private banks that have suspended payments successively has reached more than thirty-four. The symptoms of Ningbo's financial problems have changed from acute to chronic.</p>
<p>Ningbo is a major port in eastern Zhejiang, and its private banking industry has always been prosperous. In the past, the industry extended loans not only to local areas and the surrounding countryside, but also to various places in Wuhan, especially Shanghai. Long-term and mortgage loans totaled 30 to 40 million yuan. Although there has been some contraction in recent years, long-term loans, including accumulated interest, still amount to 20 million yuan. These loans are mostly used by the seafood, medicinal materials, and northern goods industries in the southern part of the city and the hardware industry in Hongkou. Now, it is difficult for the banks themselves to cope with deposit withdrawals, so the need to recover long-term loans is almost inevitable. It is still remembered that when long-term loans matured at the end of April, a small number of businesses were unable to repay them and the issue has not yet been resolved. The term of ten months is only two months away, and the fatigue of the market remains the same. The stagnation of commerce has not yet shown any signs of recovery. Even if the Ningbo banks want to resolutely recover the loans, the difficulty can be imagined.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in Ningbo, Shipu (under Xiangshan), Dinghai, Fenghua and other places closely related to the port have been affected successively. News has spread that in Shipu alone, out of only seven private banks, four have already collapsed. Three private banks in Dinghai have also suspended operations. In Daqiao Town, Fenghua, two pawnshops have also suspended operations as a result. This is because these private banks and pawnshops rely on Ningbo's private banks to turn over and regulate funds. Now that Ningbo has become a stalemate, it is difficult for the inland areas to remain unaffected. The so-called Ningbo financial crisis has expanded to become a financial panic in eastern Zhejiang. The old Ningbo counties are the center of the fishing industry along the coast of Zhejiang Province. Its position in the province's economy is quite important. In the past, the financial regulation of fishermen relied on local private banks for indirect lending. Although fishermen were doubly exploited by the heavy interest, they were still able to survive. Now that the autumn fishing season is imminent and the fishermen's need for funds is urgent, the private banks in the counties are all in a precarious state. How can one expect them to sacrifice themselves for others?

<p>(Xuzhou) Tongbei is in dire straits. The water in the Linjia Dam is increasing, and it is difficult to close the gap in the people's embankment upstream of the Jing River. The southern section of the west dike of Weishan Lake will collapse. Two thousand laborers in the urban area set out to build the Bipa Mountain Dyke at dawn today. The planned route of the dike is connected to the Jinpu Railway base in the east and is about two or three li away from the south bank of the Bulao River. The ordnance of the Second Division stationed in the military is also mobilized to help build the Chedaokou Dam. The dam connects Bipa Mountain in the east and Jiuli Mountain in the west and is a key area for flood prevention in the north of the city. The Lanjia Dam and the west dike of Weishan Lake are still being desperately blocked. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Xuzhou authorities believe that the situation in Linjia Dam and Zhanggushan cannot be maintained and it is difficult to block. They have no choice but to give up again. They are now engaged in the construction of the second and third defense lines in northern Xuzhou. Starting from the 19th, they are rushing to build the Bipa Mountain to Jinpu Railway base dike. At the same time, the Tongshan County Magistrate, in view of the imminent collapse of the entire southern dike of Weishan Lake, is rushing to block the horizontal dike in northern Weishan Lake to prevent the Yellow River water from flowing back and breaking the dike, endangering Fengxian, Pei and Xiao counties. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhang Gushan Surrounded by Water</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water in Weishan Lake has risen sharply, overflowing the entrances. The flood is flowing horizontally south of Linjia Dam. The southern section of the west dike of Weishan Lake has water on both sides. Zhang Gushan is surrounded by water. The Jing River and the Bulao River downstream have both overflowed their banks. The situation in northern Tongshan is extremely critical. Wang Gongqiong held an emergency meeting with party and government leaders in Linjia Dam this afternoon to rush to build the Bipa Mountain dike to block the torrential flow, and to collect laborers from the city to build the Chedaokou Dam, and to request the stationed troops to help build the northern city wall dike in case of emergency.

<p>The Dikes of Weishan Lake Cannot Be Blocked</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Zhang Gushan telephoned at noon on the 19th, saying that the Yellow River water was surging down. The Linjia Dam and the west dike of Weishan Lake were under attack from both sides, and there were many holes in the sandy dike, which were being scoured inside and out, making the situation extremely dangerous. Although County Magistrate Wang Gongyu and Commissioner Shao sent Chief of Staff Wang Picheng and Public Security Bureau Chief Zhao Yuxin to supervise the work on the evening of the 18th, it was still impossible to block the gaps. The people's embankments that had been breached at various places, with the northeast wind rising at night, the dikes showed signs of shaking. Although thousands of laborers were rushing to protect them, the water was vast, and there was nowhere to get soil. The people's embankment between Zhanggushan in the south and Lanjia Mountain was breached by dozens of zhang again, and the Yellow River water flooded north and south. Six or seven li to the west, it had already approached the Zhacheng. At the same time, the west dike of Weishan Lake leaked everywhere at night, and it was impossible to block it. In the morning of the 19th, a large section of the southern end of the dike collapsed again, and the water in the lake was rushing westward. The officials and people protecting the dike had not rested for several days and nights, and they were exhausted and disheartened because they despaired of protecting the dike. Everyone was filled with despair. On the morning of the 19th, the masses automatically collapsed and fled. Although the military police, government party, and various agency leaders tried to suppress them, they could not maintain the collapsed morale. They could only obey fate regarding the already breached dikes. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The situation he saw was very clear, vastly different from what he had heard and known before. Regarding the climate and land of the Northwest, it is not as bad as we imagined. However, the suffering of the people is indeed beyond our expectations. It is true that one does not know the vastness of the Northwest until one has been there, and even less does one know the poverty and hardship. If we talk about development, we must use planned and economical methods to work gradually towards prosperity. The most important thing is to facilitate transportation and communication and consolidate the people's economic foundation. Convenient transportation will allow the rich resources and products of the Northwest to be exported, and all necessities of life can also be transported in, so that the social economy is prosperous, and the people can be well-fed and clothed, living above the subsistence level, and then they can engage in all construction. The Northwest is the birthplace of our nation, with many great relics of national heroes. We should promote this national spirit and not let it be abandoned. We hope the whole country will work together. Shao finished his speech, and the meeting adjourned after 9:00 AM. (19th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Peace in East Africa Hanging by a Thread; Paris Conference Breaks Down; Italy Determined to Make Abyssinia a Protectorate; British and French Mediation Efforts Fail <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) The tripartite conference on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute failed last night, and a war in Africa may not be avoided. Britain and France had previously proposed to Italy a suggestion regarding the concession of economic rights to Abyssinia, which reportedly included three conditions: (1) Maintaining Abyssinia's political independence and territorial integrity; (2) Abyssinia's agreement; (3) The League of Nations' agreement. Last night, Italian Representative Aloisi brought Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's reply to the meeting. The British and French representatives both considered it unsatisfactory and announced an adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p>Joint Communiqué Issued</p>
<p>A communiqué signed by Laval, Eden, and Aloisi was subsequently issued, stating that the three statesmen gathered to seek a peaceful resolution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, but ultimately failed to find a basis for discussion that could resolve the dispute. The difficulties encountered in formulating suggestions require an announcement of adjournment, and future discussions will continue through diplomatic channels. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>Main Reason for the Breakdown of Negotiations</p>
<p>British Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden and Italian Representative Aloisi will meet with Laval once more tomorrow before departing for their respective countries. It is reported that the main reason for the stalemate in the talks is that Italy is determined to take at least a portion of Abyssinia as an Italian protectorate. This objective of Italy has met with two obstacles: Firstly, the Abyssinian Emperor is determined to oppose territorial concessions; Secondly, British Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden is also determined to abide by the obligations in the League of Nations Covenant to guarantee the territorial integrity and political independence of member states. Therefore, the negotiations have broken down. The suggestions jointly proposed by Britain and France are divided into three items: (1) Giving Italy broad possibilities to develop the economy in Abyssinia; (2) Ensuring the security of the borders of Italian territories in East Africa; (3) Protecting Italian immigrants within Abyssinia. This suggestion does not conflict with the League of Nations Covenant, and Abyssinia would also be happy to accept it because its territorial integrity and political independence can be maintained. Unfortunately, Italy resolutely refused, and the negotiations had to be halted. (18th Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>League of Nations Achievement Unlikely</p>
<p>(Geneva) The breakdown of the Paris tripartite conference is astonishing. The only remaining hope for averting the war in Africa lies in the League of Nations Council meeting to be held on September 4. People in the League of Nations all feel that practical results cannot be achieved by mere talks, but no one knows what will be done other than empty talk.</p>
<p>Laval said that he has not given up hope for averting the war, as the League of Nations Council meeting on September 4 could make a final effort. However, Eden does not have such wishful thinking. Italy's demands are effectively seeking to make Abyssinia its protectorate. Unless Italy reduces this demand, it will be difficult to reach a negotiated resolution before the League of Nations Council meeting. Judging from the attitude of the Italian delegation, Italy does not seem likely to make any concessions. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Says No Hope is Dashed</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's one word "no" in a telegram today has completely dashed the hope of the tripartite conference preventing the East African war. After Italy rejected the British and French proposals, the tripartite conference issued a communiqué this morning, stating that because "difficulties have arisen after considering all proposals," it announced an adjournment of the meeting. However, future research will be conducted through diplomatic channels. (18th Guomin News Agency) The Italian government's attitude towards the British and French proposals has not greatly surprised the parties involved in the conference, as the Italian delegation had a tough attitude from the beginning, so it was known early on that there would be no good results. The main difficulty now is Italy's demand for political suzerainty over Abyssinia. It is heard that the British delegation firmly opposes this concession of rights, and the French representative is trying to find a solution that satisfies both parties, so it is suggested that the Abyssinian government hire Italian consultants, so that Italy can gain special political influence in Abyssinia without conflicting with Abyssinia's sovereignty and the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. However, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is still not satisfied and insists on obtaining broader political rights in Abyssinia. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>British and Italian Representatives Leave Paris</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian Representative Aloisi will visit French Prime Minister Laval before starting his journey back to Rome tonight. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Laval met with British Representative Eden this morning and then received Italian Representative Aloisi. Laval and Eden both believe that the British and French governments must now focus their efforts on preparing for the League of Nations Council meeting in Geneva on September 4. Britain and France will liaise closely with each other diplomatically on this matter. Eden met with the Abyssinian ambassador to France at the British Embassy at 11:00 AM this morning and explained the progress of the tripartite conference. It is heard that the British delegation will return to London by train this afternoon, while Eden may delay slightly. (19th Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) After the failure of the Paris tripartite conference, the British Cabinet is discussing the matter. Eden will arrive in London tonight. Foreign Secretary Runciman and Baldwin MacDonald had a phone conversation. They will now return to London from Norfolk and will likely reconsider the issue of the arms embargo on Abyssinia. Currently, Britain generally does not issue export licenses for arms destined for Italy or Abyssinia. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Hoare, who was vacationing in Norfolk, will rush back to London tonight to immediately consider the consequences of the failure of the Paris tripartite conference. There are three issues that the British Cabinet should consider: (1) The issue of the arms embargo on Italy and Abyssinia; (2) Protecting the American Embassy in the Abyssinian capital; (3) Increasing the number of troops in the British territories bordering Abyssinia. Italian Representative Aloisi made a statement at the Paris conference regarding Britain's rights to the Blue Nile water source. This statement changed the original state of British-Italian relations. The British side is deeply concerned that Italy will no longer respect the 1925 treaty, which threatens the cotton planting plan in Egypt, as planting cotton is the basic plan related to the Egyptian economy, and planting cotton on a large scale in Egypt requires adjusting the Nile water conservancy first. However, before fully understanding France's attitude, the British government will not fully determine its attitude in Geneva. Liberal and Labour public opinion both demand that Britain take strong anti-Italian action in Geneva. The Liberal Party's newspaper, the "Manchester Guardian," even suggested imposing a mineral embargo on Italy, believing that if Italy cannot import certain essential minerals, it will not be able to wage war on Abyssinia. However, it is generally believed that although the British government cannot ignore general public opinion, especially before the general election, the government cannot but have some concerns, but the government's attitude will not be as resolute as that of the Liberal Party and the Labour Party.

<p>(Paris) Today, Eden visited Laval to discuss the aftermath, but they have not yet had a thorough discussion on the policies they intend to take at the League of Nations meeting. No one in British and French circles dares to expect the League of Nations meeting to be successful. However, Laval will be heartbroken if this meeting fails again, because Laval has displayed his extraordinary talent as a mediator, but has ultimately failed to gain Italy's understanding. France's position is now particularly complex. On the one hand, it is cooperating with Britain to support the League of Nations and is eager to eliminate the war. On the other hand, it is extremely unwilling to offend Italy and endanger its newly established French-Italian friendship, which is so beneficial to it in Europe. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to responsible sources, although the British, French, and Italian tripartite conference has announced an adjournment, the door to negotiations in Paris cannot be considered completely closed. As for the French government's position, it remains committed to respecting the principles of the League of Nations Covenant and has not changed. France's policy towards Geneva is in line with the position taken by Britain. In addition, France has a deep friendship with Italy. The French delegation has made every effort to mediate in this tripartite conference, and will continue to do its best to mediate in the future, and will not interrupt it due to the adjournment of the tripartite conference.

<p>British Newspapers Criticize Italy for Disregarding the League of Nations</p>
<p>(London) The Times newspaper said in an editorial today that the seriousness of Italy's decision on the proposals put forward by the Paris tripartite conference is unthinkable. The League of Nations is a tool for Italy to obtain justice, but Italy is going back on its word and disregarding the League of Nations. If Mussolini's current attitude remains unchanged, then a direct conflict between Italy and the League of Nations will be unavoidable when the League of Nations Council meets in the future. It is now necessary to seek a solution that does not conflict with the principles of the League of Nations, otherwise the League of Nations Covenant will become a dead letter. If the League of Nations does not exist, or the League of Nations is reduced to a ridiculous and incompetent position, then European peace will only depend on new and less hopeful institutions to prevent reckless behavior. For Britain, this issue is extremely important. For France, it is even more important. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Worry About the Future of Europe</p>
<p>(Paris) "Le Petit Parisien," "L'Action Française," and "L'Écho de Paris" all expressed pessimism about the adjournment of the British, French, and Italian tripartite conference, fearing that the Italian-Abyssinian war is unavoidable. Among them, "Le Petit Parisien" said that if British public opinion urges its government to take a tough stance based on the League of Nations Covenant, Italy may withdraw from the League of Nations. However, if the East African conflict continues, the League of Nations Council may convene to seize the opportunity to seek a peaceful solution. "L'Écho de Paris" said, "Does Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intend to avenge the humiliation of the Battle of Adwa? (In the Battle of Adwa in 1896, the Italian army was defeated by Abyssinia) Does he intend to revitalize Italy's military might and make Abyssinia its colony? If Mussolini really has this ambition, then no matter how much effort is spent, it may not be possible to stop it. If so, when the League of Nations Council meets on September 4, British Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden will inevitably unfold the file on Italy's responsibilities, and Laval will only have to abide by the Council's decision, and Italy will declare its withdrawal from the League of Nations. The League of Nations is afraid that it will not be able to support itself after this crisis, and the collective security system will collapse with it. At that time, France will personally see Germany rise and put pressure on Austria. The seriousness of the European situation is self-evident. For this reason, France's situation is very difficult. In order to avoid this danger, France must cooperate with Britain on the one hand, and must also liaise with Rome on the other. If not, Italy will break the peace discipline without any scruples and will turn to Germany to conspire to cause trouble. This is something that must be prevented in advance."

<p>(Rome) Roman figures are not surprised nor regretful about the outcome of the Paris Tripartite Conference. It is said that the final thing Italy desired was reconciliation. The Italian government is now determined to conquer Abyssinia, and then economically and politically control the country through military occupation. Italian circles believe that the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting scheduled for September 4th is unlikely to be more successful than the Paris Conference, and may even have more serious consequences. Italy now feels that America's attempt to eliminate the war has made it more likely for Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations than a month ago.

<p>Abyssinia Lacks New Medical Knowledge</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, although the general public wants to know the general situation of medicine in Abyssinia, they suffer from the lack of people who are familiar with the details. Dr. Martini, the French director of the hospital established by former Abyssinian Emperor Menelik II in Addis Ababa, has made some publications on this issue for reference. The main points are as follows: "Strictly speaking, there is no medicine in Abyssinia. The general public has little faith in the local indigenous doctors, and rarely consults foreign doctors, whether they are Europeans, Syrians, or Indians. These foreign doctors often do not have formal medical certificates, so it is natural that they cannot gain the faith of the Abyssinian people. Therefore, those who are ill mostly seek treatment from witch doctors. Only when they have no other choice do they seek diagnosis and treatment from these mediocre doctors who have learned from experience but lack basic knowledge. If one place is ineffective, they change to another place, and some even change to four or five places or more. These mediocre doctors charge extremely high prices, causing people to have a bad impression, thinking that medical treatment is simple in procedure but extremely expensive in cost. Therefore, they all hesitate and are unwilling to try it lightly unless absolutely necessary. The Abyssinian Emperor, in view of this, established several hospitals, and the hospital presided over by Dr. Martini is the most famous. Dr. Martini has studied the special circumstances of Abyssinian people's illnesses for many years and has gained a lot of experience. He has published papers in the "Medical Century" magazine, and some of his theories coincide with those recently discovered by other scholars in Europe. Therefore, Dr. Martini can be called the most contributing person to Abyssinian medicine. However, although the establishment of hospitals is roughly scaled, surgical equipment is still lacking in places other than a corner of the Abyssinian capital. In the event of war with foreign countries, it is necessary to recruit surgical doctors, assistants, and all necessary equipment from Europe. This issue is now being considered by the Abyssinian authorities. As for the most prevalent disease in Abyssinia, venereal disease affects 50% of the national population, but its cause is mostly hereditary, so after several generations, the effect of the bacteria has been reduced. Abyssinian people mostly use a very clumsy method to treat this disease. A goat is placed in the same room as the patient, and the doors and windows are tightly closed. A brazier is lit in the room to gradually increase the heat, because the only principle of treating venereal disease in Abyssinia is to "feed the bacteria" as much as possible, and strong heat and avoiding wind and light are good methods for treating all diseases. If the bacteria are not properly fed, the patient will be swallowed by the "bacteria." Therefore, the patient must skin the goat in the hot room, drink its blood, and eat twelve parts of the goat's body raw, accompanied by fine wine, until drunk and full. The amount of food is so abundant that if a European were to take it, they would be so full that they would die. This is because it does not conform to the above-mentioned principle of properly feeding the bacteria. After eating like this for four or five months, sores will inevitably appear all over the patient's body. At this time, they must go to hot springs to bathe. The most famous is "Philhoa Spring." In addition to bathing in it, patients must also scoop up and drink its water. Although there are many skin disease patients filling the spring, everyone drinks the water as usual without any scruples. After bathing in the hot springs for a considerable period of time, the patient must be placed in a tent with a brazier lit inside to make the patient sweat a lot, and inject a medicinal juice. After forty days, the disease will be cured and will never recur. This treatment method has been passed down through generations by the Abyssinian people, and they all believe in it without a doubt. It still has the faith of the general public today. It goes without saying that it does not conform to the principles of new medicine. In addition, Abyssinia has a special "panacea" that is famous all over the world, commonly known as "Cusso," which is made by soaking several kinds of red and white flowers. Its efficacy is so broad that it can treat almost all diseases, such as enhancing digestion, clearing blood, detoxifying, and treating poison injuries. The Abyssinian people like to eat raw meat the most, so they take this medicine the most. In short, Abyssinian medicine is clumsy and crude in terms of the old, and simple and crude in terms of the new. The most dominant force is still the old customs of the witch doctors. Although the Abyssinian Emperor is making every effort to introduce new medical knowledge, the traditional forces are still hindering it, and the foreign doctors who come here are also superficial and insufficient to meet people's expectations. Therefore, the progress of promoting new medicine is extremely slow." (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Senate Silver Leader Thomas announced today that the Senate will, after the close of Congress, send representatives to Europe, Asia, and South America to investigate the silver situation in preparation for a final effort when Congress reconvenes in January next year, hoping to establish a new silver law. Senator Thomas will personally go to Mexico, and Senator Wheeler will go to China, and will conveniently visit Japan and the Philippines. Senator Hupp, who is now in Europe, will report on the situation in Europe. The Senate Agriculture Committee, at Thomas's request, has approved the organization of a subcommittee to investigate the silver issue. The committee members are Wheeler, Peng Hai, Frazier, and Xiqidan, with Thomas as the chairman. It is reported that the committee's investigation will run in parallel with the Biderman Committee appointed by the government, and will compete with it. However, the Thomas Committee is inferior to the Biderman Committee in terms of financial resources and real power. Thomas told the Associated Press that they intend to make the silver issue a point of contention in the next Congress and the Democratic National Convention. Wheeler said that he intends to travel with the delegation participating in the establishment ceremony of the Philippine autonomous government, but he will devote himself to staying in China and Japan in order to study the impact of the silver issue on the two countries. (Guomin News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to news here today, if Washington approves the restoration of the New York Silver Market, then forward silver trading here can proceed. Because the board of directors of the Commodity Exchange only "suspended trading" when Congress passed the existing law on August 9 last year. Therefore, if it is approved to restore, it only needs to be slightly reorganized to be able to trade at any time. The future of silver legislation in the current Congress is difficult to determine due to the different proposals in the Senate and the House of Representatives. However, what is concerned here is only the restoration of the market. It is said that silver is largely related to the repeated decline in prices after the war. Some people believe that the rise in silver prices can help the prosperity of the market. However, the recent ups and downs of the silver market have no major impact on the general market prices. Silver experts here said that the recent sharp decline in silver prices in New York and London has no significant impact on foreign exchange. Because the period for the export of American agricultural products is approaching, foreign exchange should be used to prevent the rise of the US dollar. The current rise in Anglo-American exchange rates is evidence of this. Furthermore, Britain has sent personnel to investigate China's currency problem. Before the report is seen, the US Treasury Department will maintain the current price in the London market. However, the final silver price may rise along with world prices.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota said that at the end of last month, the directors and ministers of the ministry had suggested to the minister and vice minister that it was necessary to carry out the reorganization of senior officials and imperial officials in order to improve diplomatic efficiency. Moreover, administrative officials also submitted a written opinion on diplomatic reform. Therefore, it was decided to take the opportunity of the regular changes in December to make major reforms. The purpose of the changes is to improve diplomatic efficiency, and the aim is to inject fresh air. This move is enough to be a touchstone for the abilities of Foreign Minister Hirota and Vice Minister Shigemitsu. The fundamental principles of this reform are roughly as follows: (1) Ambassadors and ministers-level officials who are currently on standby will be allowed to retire from active duty when their standby period expires, or they will voluntarily request retirement. However, even those who are on standby and capable can still be reused. (2) Among the active ambassadors and ministers, those who have stayed for more than two terms will, in principle, be required to resign voluntarily. (3) Higher officials below the rank of imperial appointees who have been in their current positions for a long time and cannot be promoted to senior officials or mandated appointees will be allowed to retire before December. (4) There is a need to reorganize the personnel efficiency of the consuls-general, section chiefs, and consuls of the third, fourth, and fifth classes of higher officials, many of whom are special appointees from the war. About ten to fifteen people will be reorganized. (5) In principle, the reorganization of those below the rank of imperial appointees will recall those currently working overseas. Section chiefs and administrative officials working in the ministry will be excluded from the scope of the reorganization. (Den-tsu News Agency, 19th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Dr. Schacht, President of the German National Bank and Acting Minister of Economic Affairs, delivered a speech in Königsberg today, issuing an extremely serious warning regarding Germany's financial difficulties since Hitler came to power in 1933. He especially criticized the extreme members of the National Socialist Party who wanted to solve the country's economic difficulties with bizarre methods, and the disturbances caused by the exclusion of religion and Jews, which made the economic difficulties more dangerous. Some parts of his speech were deleted by news agencies due to the slightly激烈的词. Dr. Schacht said that Germany is currently encountering the greatest task rare in history. How to implement this task, including rearmament, makes me racking my brains. To overcome the current difficulties with cheap and impassioned words is not only meaningless, but also very dangerous. The whole world is in the midst of difficult difficulties. It is absurd to say that we alone are not. On the contrary, our work is more difficult than other countries. If the whole country is united and supports the head of state, then the head of state's policy can succeed. If finance prevents us from implementing our work, then those who are responsible are those who act undisciplined. Dr. Schacht continued to talk about Germany's foreign debt, saying that I must constantly strive to satisfy foreign creditors to the extent possible. The key to how to raise the huge amount of funds required for rearmament and the resettlement of the unemployed is to completely centralize the country's entire financial policy. By ordinary standards, the amount of this expenditure is almost unprecedented. It will be repaid by the savings and work of the German people in the future. I must loudly warn that spending a penny unnecessarily will make the overall situation more serious. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>(XIV) The Tight Organization of the Reception</p>
<p>The first group of more than 180 annual meeting members, divided among the Guiqiang, Guide, and Xinyiean steamships, departed Wuzhou at 11 PM on the 8th, heading directly to Nanning. Ma Junwu, the president of Guangxi University, and others personally boarded the ships to bid farewell. Each ship carried only over 200 tons and had 90 horsepower, yet it carried 50 to 60 passengers, feeling particularly crowded. The Wuzhou reception office initially planned to have a portion travel by car, but ultimately abandoned the idea due to the rising water level and muddy roads. Instead, female guests stayed in the cabins, and most male guests slept on the floor. Dozens of people lived in one room, the air was murky, and at first, it was quite painful. Overnight, everyone felt calm and collected, and the river breeze was gentle, eliminating the heat, turning it into enjoyment. Along the river, the water level rose, and the current was rapid. Initially, there were many plains on both sides, with distant mountains faintly visible. After reaching Guiping, the mountains became precipitous, mostly protruding from the plains, forming vertical shapes, or connecting like pen rests, or like a giant stone bamboo shoot. In Chinese paintings, we often see mountain paintings depicting such bizarre mountain shapes, thinking that they were the fantasies of artists, deliberately made bizarre, but now we have finally seen them in person. Those on the boat who had not traveled to Guangxi all pointed and gazed from the windows. According to those who had traveled there, after passing this point, these strange mountains are everywhere, especially in Guilin, common sights, and not surprising. The ship briefly docked at Pingnan, Guiping, Guixian, Hengxian, and Yongchun. Boatmen relied on the ship to sell fruits, food, and other things, vying to buy them, business was booming. Things like pineapples, bananas, star fruit, longan, etc. were all extremely fresh, sweet, and delicious. There is also a famous fruit called Huangpi, Guangxi's is the best, its shape is similar to longan, but it has many pits and is sweet, and the skin is particularly fragrant. The ship arrived in Nanning on the morning of the 11th. Guangxi authorities sent personnel to board the ship to welcome them and prepared a large number of carts. Banners welcoming the annual meeting were hung along the way, with words asking for guidance and criticism of Guangxi's construction. The streets were tidy, and the atmosphere was solemn. Westerners and Japanese people stayed at the Qunle Society, a magnificent and elegant building, similar to a club, almost like a YMCA. It had facilities such as a swimming pool and tennis court, and offered complete Western-style services. The rest were housed in various reception centers, also very comfortable and considerate. The Guangxi authorities formed a reception committee, providing diligent hospitality, with no detail spared. The organization of each group was extremely tight, with no confusion at all. Everything was in good order, proving the effectiveness of daily training, which cannot be achieved overnight. As the saying goes, "Observe a person in small details." From this, we can get a glimpse of Guangxi's achievements.</p>
<p>(XV) The Academic Qualifications of Foreign Members</p>
<p>This joint annual meeting of six academic groups held in Nanning, gathering academic circles from all over the country in one place, is truly an unprecedented event. The members who came to participate were divided into groups: Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi were one group, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui were one group, Jiangsu and Zhejiang were one group, Fujian and Guangdong were one group, and Sichuan and Yunnan were another group. Each province had scholars, and Guangdong accounted for the largest number due to its proximity. Therefore, the languages in the annual meeting were mainly Cantonese, Mandarin, and Shanghainese. Among the foreign members, there was (1) Professor Hacks of the Geography Department of National Central University from Austria, who also presented a paper titled "Classification of Austrian Topography." (2) Dr. Zha Shi, a German linguist, who could speak seven languages including Chinese, English, Russian, French, German, Japanese, and Latin, and spoke Mandarin particularly fluently. (3) Mr. and Mrs. Wallace, zoology professors from Lingnan University. (4) Mr. and Mrs. Hofman, chemistry professors from Lumei University. (5) Ms. Li Fushi, a biology professor from Jinling Women's University. And three Japanese researchers from the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences: Ren Shui Songichiro, Kimura Koichi, and Higashinaka Hideo, who were researching Chinese medicine and geography, all had papers. Kimura's paper was titled "Research on Chinese Dendrobium," which was of some value. Among all the Chinese members, university professors were the majority, followed by middle school teachers. Famous domestic universities such as National Central University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, Jinling Women's University, Sun Yat-sen University, and Lingnan University all participated. However, apart from the foreign members, many of the papers presented by Chinese members were also written in English, which was the biggest shortcoming. If it is for the convenience of foreigners to read, then there is no need to hold a meeting in China. If they feel that it is difficult to find accurate translations for specialized terms, they might as well include the terms in both Chinese and English. If it is for showing off and wanting to demonstrate their expertise in foreign literature, then it reflects their ignorance of Chinese studies, which is also not a good idea.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Overview of Guangdong Province's Overseas Workers in the Last Six Months: Departures to the Americas Are Almost Zero; Departures to Nanyang Are Slightly More Than Before; Singapore Recently Imposed Entry Restrictions Again <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has always had a large number of overseas Chinese workers. Since the global recession spread, the number of unemployed overseas Chinese is overwhelming, and they have been forced to return to China. Those going to the Americas have traditionally been from Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, and Xinhui counties, while those going to Nanyang have traditionally been from Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Qiongya counties. Recently, due to the sharp drop in gold prices in the Americas, the economy of overseas Chinese in America has been greatly affected, and the US government has restricted the export of cash. The amount of money remitted back to their hometowns each year by overseas Chinese in America is less than one-tenth or two-tenths of what it used to be. In addition, the anti-Chinese sentiment in America is becoming increasingly fierce. Overseas Chinese workers who have been in America for a long time are losing their jobs. Recently, there have been restrictions on Chinese entering the country, so those in the interior who seek work in America are invisibly stopped in their tracks. In this situation, not only are the finances of the Siyi people depleted day by day, but the economy of the entire province is also greatly affected. As for Nanyang, in recent years, due to the low prices of rubber and tin rice and the lack of sales, the number of Nanyang Chinese merchants going bankrupt is increasing day by day. As a result, the number of unemployed Chinese workers in Nanyang is no less than hundreds of thousands, wandering and being expelled back to China by the local government. The situation is so miserable that it is unbearable to witness. The Singapore government, due to the surplus of Chinese workers and fearing that it would affect public order, has issued regulations restricting the entry of Chinese workers, but female guests are not subject to these restrictions. At this time, the silk industry in Shunde and Nanhai counties in Guangdong Province was in decline, and all female workers lost their jobs. As a result, no less than tens of thousands of Shunde female workers went to Nanyang. It was not until the early spring of last year that the prices of Nanyang rubber and tin rice rose, and the declining business seemed to have hopes of recovery. Singapore's limit on the number of Chinese workers entering the country was increased to 4,000 per month. However, due to the simultaneous restriction of production, prosperity has not yet recovered. However, in the midst of this slight turnaround in Nanyang business, Cantonese people flocked to Nanyang again. In addition to the people from Chao'an and Meixian counties who left through Shantou, 4,870 people left the country from Haikou City in half a year (from January to June of this year), and also several hundred people left from Guangzhou City to Hong Kong. Among them, the majority went to Singapore. At this point, there were suddenly more than 100,000 Chinese workers in Nanyang. The slightly developing industry and commerce could not fully accommodate these more than 100,000 people, and the supply of male and female Chinese workers again exceeded demand, with 30-40% unemployed. To prevent this, the Singapore government recently issued new regulations restricting Chinese workers, ordering that from September 1st, the previous limit of 4,000 Chinese workers entering the country will be reduced to 2,500 to adjust the local labor force. Only when industry and commerce develop slightly further will the number of entries be increased as appropriate. (August 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Anhui Province, Tongling County: All Prisoners Break Out of Jail, Seize Dozens of Police Guns, Plot Riot, Security Team Encircle and Attack, Many Killed and Wounded <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: In Tongling County, southern Anhui, the government and prison were holding a total of eighty-one inmates, both convicted and awaiting trial. Due to the current hot weather, every day around one or two in the afternoon, they were allowed to fetch water and bathe. On the 17th, at one o'clock in the afternoon, all the prisoners took advantage of this opportunity to riot, first knocking down two guards at the gate, seizing two quick-firing guns, and immediately firing shots as a demonstration. Some of the prisoners in shackles had their shackles removed by their companions. Then, they rushed to the back of the county government, seized over twenty rifles used by the police, and, relying on their perceived strength, planned to rush out of the county government and create disturbances on the streets, causing panic throughout the city. Soon after, the 7th company of the 2nd battalion of the 4th security regiment, newly transferred from Wuhu to garrison in the county, received the news. Led by Company Commander Shi Qicheng, they rushed to the scene and surrounded the county government from the front and rear gates. The prisoners were forced back into the county government's main hall and began to fire in resistance, leading to a fierce battle lasting several hours. The situation throughout the county was extremely tense. Eventually, the prisoners, feeling weak and lacking in courage, some voluntarily returned to their cells, while others escaped by climbing over the walls. The tense situation gradually calmed down and returned to normal. The result was three people killed on the spot, one seriously injured, and several others slightly injured. Eleven people escaped, and most of the seized firearms were recovered. On the security team's side, during the fierce battle, one soldier, Zeng Ruitang, was killed by a bullet. Shao Congxian, Hu Guanghai, and Fu Chuanjie were seriously injured. A passerby, Mr. Jia, was also seriously injured when a stray bullet pierced his cheek. Shao Congxian and Hu Guanghai, who were seriously injured, were sent to Wuhu for medical treatment by boat overnight, but Shao died shortly after landing due to excessive blood loss. Hu was sent to the hospital for treatment. This riot occurred while County Magistrate Qiu Chang was in the countryside surveying the embankments and the security team was being transferred for defense. They attempted to take advantage of the situation, but fortunately, the defense was effective, and the area did not suffer any damage. County Magistrate Qiu has rushed back to the county seat to handle the aftermath and has telegraphed the provincial government and the Second District Commissioner's Office here to report the details of the incident.

<p>Shen Bangda, the deputy of the 12th Security Brigade of Jiangsu Province, has been in Songjiang for several years and has a reputation for military discipline. Recently, he received an order from Director Xiang of the Security Office to be transferred as deputy of the 2nd Brigade, stationed permanently in the provincial capital. His vacancy will be filled by Zhao Zanchen, the deputy of the 13th Brigade. After receiving the order, Shen completed the handover on the 18th. Various institutions held banquets to see him off and presented him with souvenirs. At 11:13 AM on the 19th, he departed by train to the garrison. Brigade Commander Jin Tigan and other officers went to the station to see him off and set off firecrackers to pay their respects.</p>

<p>At 8:00 AM on the 17th, at the First Building Tea House in the North Port of Beizha Town, our county, while business was bustling, a room on the back of the building suddenly collapsed, causing a room downstairs to collapse as well. The tea guests were caught off guard and unable to escape, resulting in nine injuries. Zhao Jingyun, a barber, died on the spot from a crushed skull. The remaining eight, including Shi Jianshan, sustained injuries of varying degrees of severity and have been sent to Suzhou for treatment. The homeowner, Xia Guanlong, and the tea house owner, Wang Xukui, have been taken into custody by the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Changshu: Shanghai-Xizhi Road to Extend Northward <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Xizhi Highway officially opened to traffic on the 17th, with passenger tickets being sold. On the day of the ceremony, over three thousand guests from Shanghai and Suzhou arrived in Changshu, leaving a very good impression. According to news from the bus station, General Manager Wang Xiaoxiang stated that the company's business policy is to develop the interior, with Changshu as the central hub. Currently, there are plans to extend northward from Changshu, extending the route to Shazhou City and Shiyiwei Port, reaching Nantong. If bridges need to be built across the river, the cost would be high and the project too large, so ferries may be used instead. In the future, north-south transportation along the Yangtze River and the industry and commerce of various counties along the route will be able to develop to their full potential.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Wuxi: Silk Cocoon Prices Soar for Consecutive Days <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Silk prices have been soaring for consecutive days, with strong exports, raising hopes for the revival of the silk industry. The reason is that European and American countries are using more Chinese silk, while Japan is restricting silkworm rearing, resulting in a decrease in silk cocoon production and sluggish sales of artificial silk. Therefore, this year's silk cocoon market price has soared, marking a new era unseen in recent years. The quality of silk cocoons from the southern route (i.e., Wuxi) is considered the best. The other day, the price of Japanese silk rose to 790 Japanese yen per dan, equivalent to 640 Chinese yuan. Currently, Chinese silk of A grade, 13 to 15 strands, can be sold for around 600 yuan per dan, while 20 and 22 strands can be sold for 530 to 540 yuan per dan. Ordinary silk can also be sold for around 500 yuan. The highest price for cocoons has risen to 135 yuan per dan, with ordinary cocoons at 120 yuan. Thirty-nine silk factories in this county have already started operations.</p>

<p>The construction of the Wujin to Jiaoxi highway, contracted out by the highway bus company, has already begun. It is now known that the Construction Department has sent personnel to Changzhou to investigate. Because the road route map and engineering had not been approved by the Department, construction cannot begin. The county has been ordered to halt work immediately and must wait for approval before construction can resume. The county government, upon receiving the order, immediately instructed compliance. As for the extension of the road to Wuxi, technician Shen Zhiyu was dispatched yesterday to conduct surveys. He has now surveyed to the border of Wuxi and will submit the survey results to the Department for approval within days.</p>

<p>Former County Magistrate Bi Jingqian of this county was granted permission by the Provincial Department to resign and officially handed over his duties on August 1st. Various public institutions and local gentry in this county, recognizing County Magistrate Bi's commendable performance during his nearly two-year tenure, initiated a grand farewell gathering and banquet at the County Chamber of Commerce. As County Magistrate Bi's handover was nearing completion, he boarded a car to return home yesterday. From the county government to the train station, memorial banners were posted along the route, and dozens of groups of people lined the streets to see him off. Local public groups and gentry escorted County Magistrate Bi to the train station, where over a thousand people were gathered to bid him farewell. They all raised their hands in salute. As the train departed, military music and firecrackers filled the air. Bi repeatedly nodded from the train window to express his gratitude. The grandeur of the scene was unprecedented in twenty years.</p>

<p>The county government of this county has repeatedly received instructions from the Grand Canal Flood Prevention Office and the Provincial Government to expedite the requisition of labor and the accumulation of soil. The county's flood prevention association previously dispatched representatives Ma Junqing, Wang Hongzao, and Ding Fengnian to Huaiyin to meet with Director Xu Dingkang, presenting the difficulties of requisitioning labor and accumulating soil. Director Xu agreed to allow County Magistrate Cao to handle the matter according to local conditions. The office then instructed the county government to provide each cubic foot of soil with a tea and water subsidy of four cents and a subsidy of eight cents for those transported by boat. Work began the other day. However, the laborers had no food, the supervisors were extremely abusive, and the bailiffs privately collected a registration fee of sixty-six copper coins per person. Enduring various hardships and witnessing the arbitrary destruction of their crops, public outrage was ignited. About three thousand farmers, each wielding farm implements, stormed into the county government in the city at 10:00 AM today (the 17th). County Magistrate Cao had gone to Jieshou to inspect the work. The farmers then demolished the police chief's office and the judicial office, destroying all walls, tables, chairs, and equipment. The case files were scattered all over the ground. Important county government officials fled. The judicial secretary, Sun Juexian, and the bailiff, Lu Yunqi, were tied up and severely beaten. Subsequently, they went to the First District Office and the residence of the construction section chief, Jia Fengren, and destroyed everything. As of 8:00 PM, the villagers had not left the city.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Hangzhou: Mogan Mountain Commercial Decline <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Mogan Mountain is a summer resort in Zhejiang Province. Every summer, many Chinese and foreigners come to the mountain to escape the heat, and hotels and shops all benefit greatly. Due to the decline of the social economy this year, even during the hot summer months, there are very few tourists escaping the heat, and the market is sluggish. The shops in Wukang Road, the busiest commercial area on the mountain, have very few customers, so each shop is complaining and suffering heavy losses. The best ones are barely able to maintain themselves. The number of tourists in all the large and small hotels on the mountain is not as high as in previous years. The newly built houses and villas on the mountain have no takers for rent. The weather has been slightly cooler in recent days, and tourists have been leaving the mountain one after another. The operating revenue of the Mogan Mountain special buses of the Highway Bureau has been greatly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Qiantang River Tide Destroys Residences <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn this year, the weather has been erratic with frequent wind and rain, and the water level of the Qiantang River has been high. It is now the autumn tide season, and due to the continuous autumn rains, the river tide is more turbulent than in previous years. The water level along the south bank of the river is nearly ten feet high. When the evening tide came the other morning, the houses along the river were submerged in water. Twenty-four shops along the south bank were washed away by the flood, and miscellaneous items were carried away by the water, causing a loss of approximately two thousand yuan. The pontoon bridge of the newly built wharf on the south bank was broken by the flood. A temporary bridge had been erected with wooden machinery at the ferry crossing. Zhang Zili, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, made a special trip to inspect the situation and dispatched workers to repair it to facilitate the passage of travelers.</p>

<h3 id="e73">President Wang Flew to Shanghai from Qingdao Yesterday, Discussing His Resignation Approved by the Central Government, Deciding to Serve the Central Standing Committee in Beijing <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: After Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs, submitted his resignation to the Central Government on the 8th of this month, the Central Government earnestly tried to persuade him to stay. However, Wang's determination to resign was still very firm. Wang arrived in Shanghai by plane from Qingdao yesterday at noon to continue medical treatment and plans to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the coming days. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai Yesterday at Noon</p>
<p>Wang boarded China National Aviation Corporation's Douglas aircraft at 9:20 AM yesterday morning and flew from Qingdao to Shanghai, arriving here at 11:55 AM at noon. He landed at Longhua Airport. Those who went to welcome him included Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Chu Minyi, and Legislative Yuan member Lin Baisheng, among others. After disembarking, Wang went straight to the residence of Zeng at Jierlu (now Jia'er Ai Road) to rest. Those who accompanied Wang to Shanghai yesterday, in addition to Mrs. Wang and her sons and daughters, included Zeng Zhongming, attending physician Luo Guanglin, and secretaries and attendants, totaling more than ten people.</p>
<p>Medical Examination</p>
<p>Wang returned to his private residence on Pushi Road (now Route Tenant de la Tour) at around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. He immediately invited Dr. Noel to examine his body and continue treatment. According to Dr. Noel, Wang's body has not yet recovered. Although the fever has subsided, his appetite and spirit have not improved and he still needs a considerable period of recuperation.</p>
<p>Mayor Visits</p>
<p>Wang went to the residence of Zeng on Jierlu again at around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and did not return to his private residence to rest until around 7:00 PM in the evening. Mayor Wu visited Wang at around 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon and expressed his condolences. After departing, Mayor Wu told reporters from various newspapers that Wang planned to stay in Shanghai for a short time before entering Beijing. Various parties are making every effort to persuade Wang to stay, but Wang's determination to resign has not been dispelled.</p>
<p>Wang's Remarks</p>
<p>Wang met with reporters from various newspapers at the residence of Zeng on Jierlu yesterday evening. According to his remarks, although my symptoms have subsided, the underlying disease has not been eliminated. Because this treatment was to avoid surgery, the gallstones have not been removed. Therefore, even an ordinary conversation, as long as it exceeds an hour, makes me feel dizzy and my heart race. According to the doctor, I should not work more than four hours each day from now on. However, the work of the Executive Yuan is heavy, and even several four-hour periods are difficult to manage. My body is, of course, of little importance, but if I were to delay national affairs due to my weak body while bearing this heavy responsibility, how would I face the people of the country? This is the reason why I submitted my resignation. Although the Central Government sent a telegram to persuade me to stay, my determination to resign is firm. I have already telegraphed the Central Government again to request resignation. If the Central Government approves my resignation, I will immediately enter Beijing to serve in the Central Standing Committee. I will stay in Shanghai for the time being to continue medical treatment. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek previously sent Zhang Yuejun to Qingdao to meet with me. I telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek today (the 19th) to inquire about the date and location of the meeting so that we can discuss everything face-to-face.</p>
<p>Sickly and Thin</p>
<p>Wang was wearing a white silk long gown yesterday. His face was thin and unusually pale. It is said that his weight has decreased from 160 pounds to 139 pounds. His spirit was very good, and his gait was healthy. His diet has gradually returned to normal. This is reassuring to the people of the country.</p>

<h3 id="e75">China Industrial Bank and Other Three Banks, Consolidating Our National Finance, Appropriation of Funds to Fill Official Shares of Three Banks, The Ministry of Finance is Currently Reviewing Measures <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: After the reorganization of the China Industrial Bank, China Merchants Bank, and Siming Bank, the internal strength has become more substantial. At that time, the Ministry of Finance had the idea of appropriating 5 million yuan each to fill the official shares of the three banks in order to enrich the shareholders. According to reporters' inquiries from various parties, this matter is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance. The three banks are all issuing banks. The paid-up capital of the China Industrial Bank is 3,507,400 yuan, and it issues 40 million yuan in convertible notes. The paid-up capital of the China Merchants Bank is 7 million yuan, and it issues approximately 10 million yuan in convertible notes. The paid-up capital of the Siming Bank is 2,250,000 yuan, and it issues more than 10 million yuan in convertible notes. After the reorganization of the three banks, they have become integrated with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, working together to consolidate our national finance.</p>
<h3 id="e76">After the Ministry of Finance Appropriates Public Bonds to Relief, It is Expected to Pass Through the End of September Safely, Financial Bonds Borrowed by the Money Industry Have Been Repaid One After Another, Few Applications for Interbank Lending from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>New Voice Agency: Since the Ministry of Finance appropriated 25 million yuan in financial bonds in 1935 to relieve the money industry, industry, and commerce and the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications handled interbank lending, the financial situation in Shanghai has stabilized, and the revival of industry and commerce is promising. There should be no problems at the end of September. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Money Industry Recovers and Repays Financial Bonds</p>
<p>After the Ministry appropriated 25 million yuan in financial bonds from 1935 and the Money Industry Supervision Committee was formed to relieve the money industry, each money shop has stabilized after adjustments. They are now repaying the financial bonds to the Ministry of Finance one after another. The rumor that the Ministry is urging the money industry to repay the financial bonds is not true. Similarly, after each money shop has consolidated itself, it is providing relief to industry and commerce, such as extending terms, handling credit loans, and accepting mortgage loans. There is factual proof of this, so industry and commerce have also benefited greatly.</p>
<p>Few Applications for Interbank Lending from Three Banks</p>
<p>After the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications jointly raised funds and formed a committee to handle interbank lending before the final settlement of accounts in 1934, it was quite effective. A reporter from New Voice Agency inquired with the three banks yesterday morning and learned that the three banks' interbank lending will continue to be handled. The funds previously lent have been repaid by each bank and money shop one after another. As of yesterday, the amount that had not been repaid was very small. However, there have been no applications for lending recently because the market has stabilized, and there is no need to apply.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Industry and Commerce Expect Mortgage Loans, The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Request to the Ministry of Finance, Urging Swift Formulation of Measures <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that in order to relieve the market in this city, the Ministry stipulated ten principles for relief loans in the letter Qianzi No. 14130 on April 16, with 15 million yuan as low-interest mortgage loans and 5 million yuan as low-interest credit loans. On July 12, the Ministry issued letter No. 626, stating that the total amount of this mortgage loan of 15 million yuan would be lent by each bank and money shop, and the loan committee would review the report. Now that the credit loan is being processed, the end of September is approaching, and most industries and businesses rely on mortgage loans for turnover, which is particularly important. According to the order, this mortgage loan must be reviewed by the committee before it can be issued. Therefore, the implementation of the mortgage depends on the formulation of the review method. The industry and commerce of this city are eagerly awaiting the realization of this measure, hoping to revitalize the economy. It is appropriate to submit a written request to the Ministry for review and to instruct the association to quickly formulate a method for reviewing and issuing loans and report it to the Ministry for implementation for the public convenience.</p>

Only the civilians on the east bank of Weishan and Lianghu were busy protecting the banks. At noon, they arrived in Xuzhou and transferred to the Longhai Railway west. The river embankments in Kaocheng, Lanfeng, Kaifeng, and Zhongmu counties in Henan Province were inquired of the personnel sent by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, who said that there were many major risks, but they were rescued in time. At 9:00 PM, they arrived in Kaifeng and met with Chairman Liu and the officials in charge of the Henan Provincial Water Disaster Relief Association. Since the beginning of the month, Henan Province has experienced continuous rain and mountain torrents, and all large and small rivers have suddenly risen simultaneously. The Yellow River itself overflowed, and Hua County and Fengqiu on the north bank and the Kaifeng, Chenliu, and river beaches on the south bank were submerged. Because the floodwaters of the Yi and Luo rivers could not flow into the Yellow River, the counties along the banks were all affected. Yanshi, located at the confluence of the two rivers, suddenly burst its banks with a water head of three feet, causing the entire county to sink. Gong County, located downstream, was also affected. In addition, the Sha, Ru, Hong, and Ying rivers in the central region also breached their banks, and Xiangyan, and the Cai, Ru, and Nan counties were all flooded. The Bo and Tang rivers in southern Henan overflowed, and the Nanyang, Xinye, Deng County, and Zhenping counties became a swamp. The Xiang River in Xichuan, which originally entered Hubei through Bokou, flowed backward and overflowed, which was inevitable. The entire territory of Danchuan County was flooded, and Huaiyou Xiangling was almost submerged. In northern Henan, the banks of the Qi, Zhang, Jun, and Qin rivers were also affected. It is estimated that there are 47 disaster areas in the province, covering more than 6,000 square kilometers, with estimated losses of more than 50 million yuan. There are 14 counties with total losses exceeding 1 million yuan, and more than 1 million disaster victims. There are many tasks for relief, and after staying overnight in Kaifeng for a brief discussion, Xiao Chen originally planned to transfer to Dongzhuang, Shandong Province, to inspect the Yellow River breach. However, the car journey would still take seven hours, and it has been extremely hot for days, with temperatures above 100 degrees. For the sake of rest, they changed to a special car, and Fang, the Inspector, and Chang Zhizhen, a member of the Henan Provincial Government, traveled together, still along the Longhai Line, to first survey the disaster situation in the west. Passing through Gong County, they saw that all the fields were damaged, and many cultivated lands were buried or destroyed by sand, except for the river banks. It was reported that there were more than 70,000 disaster victims. At noon, they arrived in Yanshi and disembarked to inspect. The entire city had become a ruin, with collapsed houses, pillars, tiles, and wood blocking the roads, and broken walls and dilapidated fences worse than war. Since the flood, 40 days ago, the water in the south of the city was still more than 10 feet deep. The county government has moved to work in a cave in the hills. The 60,000 disaster victims have been displaced and are living in the open, with insufficient clothing and no remaining grass in the fields. The city is desolate and desolate. Zhou, from the United Film Company who came with them, took a film to be shown to the public. The Provincial Water Disaster Association and the Provincial Relief Association have already released 6,000 yuan for emergency relief, and Kong Shen and Cha Rong have donated 2,000 yuan, together with the 2,000 yuan in donations from overseas Chinese carried by Shiying, to transport relief grain, which is being distributed. The sanitation team has also arrived and started working. However, a drop in the bucket is not enough, which is obvious. In the future, it will be necessary to resettle the refugees, prevent major epidemics, relocate the county government, and rebuild houses. At 4:00 PM, they entered Luoyang, and Special Envoy Sheng reported that the situation in Luoyang was slightly better. Overall, the disaster situation in Henan Province cannot be comprehensively alleviated by existing relief efforts. It is hoped that all parties will continue to provide assistance. The details will be reported later. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, kowtowed. Xiao Yinshi San.</p>

<p>Banks Enthusiastically Pledge Loans</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disaster Relief in Various Provinces is contacting the banking community in this city to borrow 500,000 yuan for emergency relief, and it is planned to ask the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to share 300,000 yuan and other banks to share 200,000 yuan. After the 72nd Executive Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association resolved to divide the funds into two groups, (A) 10,000 yuan and (B) 5,000 yuan, it sent a circular to all member banks, allowing them to undertake the tasks freely. It is reported that the banks that have replied to the Banking Association in recent days, acknowledging this pledge, have been very enthusiastic. In a few days, the total has reached more than 100,000 yuan, and it is expected that the amount of 200,000 yuan will be recognized soon.</p>
<p>Jin Cheng Theater's Total Relief Contribution</p>
<p>Jin Cheng Theater in this city, concerned about the severe disaster situation in the country and the wandering refugees, showed compassion and held a charity film screening on the 8th of this month to provide relief. On that day, the theater requested the films "New Women" and "The Big Road" from the Lianhua Company, and "The Peach Blossom Calamity" from the Dian Tong Company, all of which waived rental fees. Statistics show that the three screenings, day and night, generated a total income of 249 yuan and 8 jiao in silver dollars. After deducting any expenses, the entire amount was used for relief and has been exchanged by the theater for a check from Dakang Bank dated August 16, which was sent to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disaster Relief in Various Provinces for verification and transfer to the disaster area for relief.</p>

<p>In recent years, the sales of cotton cloth have been declining due to the dumping of foreign goods, which has greatly reduced the livelihood of farmers. Recognizing this, the International Trade Bureau has repeatedly convened cotton cloth merchants to inquire about the current situation of cotton cloth production and sales, believing that relief is essential. Therefore, the bureau has scheduled a meeting with cotton cloth merchants at its office at 3:00 PM on the 21st to discuss relief measures.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Shipping Industry: Frustration of the Cooperative, Realization of Joint Sharing by Six Companies, Virtual Dissolution of the Cooperative <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Since all national shipping vessels in this city, adhering to the Ministry's orders, implemented cooperation, a council was organized, and a joint transportation office was planned. After lengthy discussions and investigations by various specialists, it was established through painstaking efforts. The prospects and hopes were boundless. Unexpectedly, with the realization of joint sharing by six companies, the cooperative gradually dissolved virtually. It is truly disheartening to speak of this.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Council</p>
<p>The shipping cooperative, through all Chinese merchant marine shipping companies and the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, aimed to fundamentally salvage the shipping industry and implement great unity, hoping to reap the initial preparation of equal navigation rights. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to Shanghai to supervise and lead. From June 1st, the shipping cooperative was formally established, attached to 10 Guangdong Road. Due to its grand scale, a council was first established by the state-run and private shipping companies as the cooperative's highest executive body. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company nominated five council members, and the private shipping companies elected six council members. The council then established various shipping joint transportation offices and a transportation fee committee, etc., placing all ships under a single leadership and management, so as to control routes and openly develop. This was considered an excellent plan.</p>
<p>Failure to Establish Various Offices</p>
<p>According to Article 8 of the cooperative's articles of association, the most important thing under the council was the organization of joint business offices for various routes along the Yangtze River and the sea. Each office would have a director and deputy director, further divided into sections to realize great shipping cooperation. However, soon after the council was established, the cooperative greatly changed its direction. While it was still proceeding in order, a joint sharing association suddenly formed on the Yangtze River route. Participating companies were not limited to national vessels; British, Japanese, and other foreign vessels could participate. Moreover, the tonnage of foreign merchant ships exceeded that of Chinese ships. With the active advancement of joint sharing, the cooperative's affairs were suspended. As a result, the council became an empty title, unable to make progress.</p>
<p>Resignation of Council Members</p>
<p>The council members of the cooperative, seeing that nothing had been done since its establishment, and that all matters that should have been handled could not proceed without funds, requested central assistance at a time when the city was stagnant and the number of idle ships was increasing. However, they were unsuccessful. Consequently, Yu Qiaqing, of the private shipping council, first resigned. Other council members also followed suit, citing a lack of work. The council members elected by the private shipping companies were Yuan [ ], Deng [ ], Bei [ ], Chen Ganqing, and [ ] Bohong, among others. Since the other offices had not been established, there were no issues. However, since Yu's resignation, the other council members have also stopped going to the cooperative to handle affairs. It seems that the cooperative has virtually dissolved.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Domestic Goods Sales Increasing Daily, Provinces Happy to Purchase, Overseas Market Promotion Widening <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the promotion of domestic goods in various regions, the Central News Agency reporter inquired in detail of Pan Yangyao, the principal organizer of domestic goods promotion in this city. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Improving Quality, Booming Sales</p>
<p>According to Pan Yangyao, in recent years, people in various regions have recognized the importance of promoting domestic goods and are actively promoting them with all their efforts. To increase the confidence of buyers, domestic goods manufacturers are striving for excellence in the manufacturing of their products. Therefore, the quality of domestic goods has greatly improved compared to the past. As a result, all sectors are happy to purchase and use them, leading to a significant increase in sales. The future is showing a booming trend. To expand sales, manufacturers have contacted customer groups in various regions and are actively promoting their products inland. Over the past year, they have reached various provinces and achieved significant results.</p>
<p>Promotion in Shanxi Province, Steadily Improving</p>
<p>Recently, Yan Xishan, Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi and Suiyuan, also recognized the importance of promoting domestic goods and is actively promoting and strongly advising the people of Shanxi Province to use domestic goods. Yan also hopes that domestic goods businesses in this city will transport goods to various parts of the province for promotion. He has sent representatives to contact domestic goods manufacturers in this city to exchange Shanxi products for domestic goods from outside the province. A method has been agreed upon, and goods have been exchanged once. Therefore, it is predicted that the promotion of domestic goods in Shanxi Province will steadily improve.</p>
<p>Northwest Provinces Happy to Purchase</p>
<p>Regarding Chengdu, Sichuan, a telegram was recently received requesting domestic goods manufacturers to quickly transport domestic goods for promotion. The telegram stated that Chengdu has a population of over 50,000 residents who are happy to purchase domestic goods and hope that domestic goods manufacturers in this city will quickly transport goods there. As for Chongqing, a domestic goods market has been established, and business is very good. Major cities within Shaanxi Province have established domestic goods markets, with excellent results, ranking first among the Northwest provinces. The Construction Department of the Gansu Provincial Government also recently sent representatives to Shanghai to contact domestic goods businesses. Chu Minyi, Chen Ce, and Zou Lin took the overnight express train to Beijing yesterday. A method for transporting domestic goods for sale has been achieved. Therefore, larger cities in that province will soon have domestic goods markets.</p>
<p>Overseas Markets Strive to Expand</p>
<p>In recent years, the International Trade Department of the Ministry of Industry has been very concerned about the export of domestic goods to overseas markets. It has now organized the China Industrial and Trade Association to specifically discuss the export of domestic goods to overseas markets. Recently, a large number of domestic goods have been shipped to Southeast Asia because overseas Chinese are happy to purchase them, resulting in significant profits. Recently, some domestic goods manufacturers have frequently inquired with the department about methods for exporting domestic goods, the types of goods needed, and are planning to organize joint sales agencies to transport large quantities of high-quality domestic goods to Southeast Asia for sale.</p>

<p>The news of group fighting between overseas Chinese and locals in the Padang, Siantar, and Sibolga areas of Sumatra, Dutch East Indies, due to a soccer game, and the initiation of the conflict, was reported in previous newspapers. According to the Overseas Chinese Federation, since this unfortunate event occurred, the domestic government and public have paid close attention to it. The Overseas Chinese Federation also sent a telegram to inquire, but no reply was received until yesterday. However, private individuals have received letters stating that the matter has been stopped by the joint efforts of Dutch East Indies authorities and Chinese consular officials, who used strong legal measures and informed all overseas Chinese and workers in the Dutch East Indies not to act rashly. The matter has now calmed down. The overseas Chinese and locals are still very peaceful and not hostile.</p>
<h3 id="e86">China-Philippines Tobacco Company Officially Opens Today, The First Sound of Overseas Chinese Returning to the Country to Start a Business <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The China-Philippines Tobacco Company, founded by prominent overseas Chinese merchants from the Philippines, including Lin Shuyan, Huang Yongkou, Zeng Ruijiao, Gao Zuchuan, Xue Minlao, Lin Jinggu, Lin Zhaopin, and Li Qingquan, is officially opening today. The factory is located at 426 Baoding Road in this city. This can be said to be another successful culmination of the government's policy of encouraging overseas Chinese to return to the country to invest. Historically, the scope of business ventures undertaken by overseas Chinese residing in the Philippines has been limited to the Philippine Islands. Although a small number of overseas Chinese had previously returned to the country, their businesses were mostly concentrated in southern Fujian. However, when Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, visited the Philippines two years ago, he deeply felt that overseas Chinese were rich in entrepreneurial spirit. He immediately advised them to return to the country to invest and engage in the revitalization of national industries. Later, when Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, toured the south last year, he stayed in the Philippine Islands for a week, visited overseas Chinese, and actively encouraged them to return to their motherland and develop industries. The then Consul General to the Philippines, [ ] Guanglin, consistently worked hard to promote the same cause. After this round of vigorous promotion by the government, a group of overseas Chinese in the Philippines decided to raise funds and return to the country to found the China-Philippines Tobacco Company. The capital was quickly raised.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Patents</p>
<p>Previously, overseas Chinese in the Philippines had established the Philippines Tobacco Company, which invented a type of cigar-style cigarette called "Cigarilla." The American government awarded it a patent, and they wanted to promote it in their home country. However, they were worried about the lack of protection against counterfeiting, so they hesitated. In addition, they produced several other types of cigarettes but did not dare to promote them in their homeland. Later, with the government's guarantee that it would grant exclusive manufacturing and sales rights for this product, the decision to establish a cigarette factory in Shanghai was made. After a period of rapid preparation, the official opening was achieved today. This is the first sound of overseas Chinese returning to the country to start a business. There are currently 150,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines who are paying close attention to this matter. If it is successful, many more will undoubtedly return to the country to invest in the future, and the national industries of the motherland will be about to unleash a unique splendor.</p>
<p>Manager Selection</p>
<p>Because the Philippines Tobacco Company holds a large share in the China-Philippines Tobacco Company, the managers sent are all highly capable. The general manager is Mr. Lin Zhaopin, who holds a Master's degree in Business Administration from the University of [ ]. He is proficient in finance and advertising and served as the general manager of the Philippines Tobacco Company for ten years. The deputy manager is Mr. Lin Jinggu, also a renowned tobacco magnate in the Philippines, on par with Mr. Lin.</p>
<p>Product Types</p>
<p>The distinguishing feature of the China-Philippines Tobacco Company is machine manufacturing and machine packaging. The machines are all the latest models, and manufacturing is purely scientific. Currently, the products include White House Cigarilla, Hero cigarettes, and Black Girl Petite Luzon sweet cigarettes. The tobacco quality and taste are different. (1) White House Cigarilla is a combination of cigar and cigarette. The raw material is tobacco produced by the company's own tobacco fields in the famous "Isabela" and "Cagayan" tobacco regions of the Philippines and scientifically cured. It is wrapped in American Georgia cigar leaf, with a fragrant aroma. Anyone who usually smokes cigars or cigarettes will surely be satisfied. This product is a new invention, entirely machine-made, clean, and hygienic. Its future popularity can be predicted. (2) Hero cigarettes are made from carefully selected Virginia tobacco leaves, properly blended. The taste is mellow, cool, and refreshing, with all the qualities of imported cigarettes, and fresher. It is also manufactured without human contact, except when the tobacco is manually transported from one machine to another. (3) Black Girl Petite Luzon sweet cigarettes are made from aged and mellow Petite Luzon tobacco leaves produced in the Cagayan region. The cigarettes are 30% larger than ordinary cigarettes. The selling prices of the above three products are all low. The White House and Black Girl brands are especially inexpensive, so that people from all walks of life can enjoy high-quality cigarettes at a very low price.</p>
<p>Business Policy</p>
<p>According to General Manager Lin Zhaopin, the selling price is not the primary concern. He said, "The profit per pack of cigarettes of our company is certainly not as high as that of other cigarette factories. However, we intend to achieve success through small profits and large sales. From the very beginning, our company will focus on quality, and our future success will depend solely on superior quality."</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration issued instructions to various departments stating: "It has been reported that there are still unscrupulous foremen on this railway who are extorting money from the workers under their command in the name of sending gifts during the three major festivals, which is truly hateful. It is hereby strictly ordered to eradicate this practice, and personnel will be dispatched to conduct secret investigations at any time and place. Once discovered, in addition to immediately dismissing the foreman, his direct superiors shall also be subject to severe disciplinary action. Furthermore, all levels of staff should refuse gifts to prevent the gradual spread of bribery. This is hereby ordered."</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration believes that the Mid-Autumn tide season is approaching rapidly. At that time, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Haining to watch the tide will inevitably be crowded. In addition to preparing to operate special tide-watching trains as usual, it also wants to facilitate travel by organizing joint transportation. It has now consulted with the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Administration to have the Highway Administration send vehicles to pick up and drop off passengers traveling from Shanghai to Chang'an Station in Haining. At the same time, it is consulting with the Shanghai-Minhang-Zhejiang long-distance bus company on the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway to organize joint transportation at various stations along the way, so that general passengers can avoid the trouble of hiring boats and vehicles separately. The draft agreement for this joint transportation is currently being drafted by representatives from both parties.</p>

<p>Anhui's Yellow Mountain is famous throughout China for its majestic and unique scenery. Since the Anhui Yellow Mountain Construction Committee has been working hard to develop it, progress has been made daily. Those who lease public land are particularly enthusiastic, and some tenants have already surveyed the land and built houses on the mountain. It has been reported that Yang Hu, Director of the Shanghai Security Bureau, along with Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, hired engineer Hu Hongzhao to go to the mountain yesterday to survey and design villas, which shows that Yellow Mountain is becoming increasingly prosperous.

<h3 id="e94">Autopsy of Corpse Murdered in Luhang District, One Suspect Apprehended <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>A male corpse murdered by someone was found on the bank of the Xiaobang in Chenjiazhai, Shuzigou, Beicai, Luhang District, Pudong the day before yesterday at dawn. Fishing nets and baskets were left next to the corpse, indicating that he was stealing fish and shrimp, was spotted by someone, and was murdered. Someone reported the incident to the Dongcai police station, which instructed the Baojia, Chen Yuetang, to report it to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for an autopsy. All details have been reported in this newspaper. It has been learned that the court dispatched Prosecutor Xiao Jinying, along with the coroner, to Pudong yesterday afternoon to conduct an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that the deceased was about thirty years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, bald, barefoot, and had countless axe wounds to his head, which was shattered, resembling a split pomegranate, with brain matter and blood flowing everywhere. The situation was particularly tragic, and he died from his injuries. A coroner's report was filled out. As there were no relatives to identify the body, it was ordered to be placed in a coffin by the [ ] Hall, pending the arrest and punishment of the murderer. An investigation revealed that the fish and shrimp in the Xiaobang were raised by Chen, a villager from Chenjiazhai. Recently, petty thieves have frequently laid nets to steal. Therefore, Chen hated them to the bone because the number of fish and shrimp purchased annually did not make up. Even if the fish and shrimp were caught and sold in the market, it would not be worth it. So, he would get up and secretly observe at night, wanting to catch them at any cost. After the incident, the Gouwei police station sent police officers to investigate the murderer in all directions and apprehended Chen. Because the short shirt he was wearing was covered in blood stains, it was suspicious. He was taken to the police station for interrogation. Although Chen denied it, the suspicion was great. It was ordered to be held in custody and transferred to the court for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Continued Trial of Monk from Putuoshan Accused of Fraud <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Youming, the abbot of Faru Temple on Putuoshan, previously came to Shanghai to solicit a large sum of money. Ye Ruilin, the owner of a closed teahouse, saw the money and, seized by greed, colluded with his maternal uncle Zhang Ayuan, fellow villager Qiu Zhongyuan, and women Wang Zhangshi and Wang Amei, to set up a "honey trap" to defraud him of money. After the monk returned to the mountain and reported it to the Buddhist Association, the association's executive committee member Ying Zhao reported it to the French Concession Police Department. Detective Hang Guangfu arrested Ye, Mai, Wang Zhangshi, and Wang Amei. Zhang Ayuan fled after hearing the news. The police department transferred Ye and the other four to the Second Special Court for investigation and detention. All details have been reported in this newspaper. This case was continued yesterday morning in the First Criminal Court by Wang Gangxu. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the police investigation found that the defendants were arrested because the plaintiff reported extortion. However, the defendants denied the allegations during the police investigation, claiming that Zhang Ayuan, a fugitive accomplice, was responsible. The case of Zhang [ ] must be solved before the truth of the case can be clarified. He requested the court to postpone the hearing again. Subsequently, the plaintiff Youming testified in detail about being forced to take photos with Wang Amei and forced to sign IOUs. He also stated that [ ] Zhongyuan had been there, while Ye Ruicai only went to the Oriental Hotel. The court questioned the defendants one by one. First, Ye Ruilin testified that he did not know about the adultery. He went to the Oriental Hotel, where the monk sent someone to call him. Qiu Zhongyuan testified that he did not participate in the adultery. Zhang Ayuan called him to the Oriental Hotel. He denied that he had claimed to be Qiu Baolin at the time. However, the plaintiff stated that Qiu Baoyuan on the IOU was the defendant Qiu Zhongyuan. Wang Zhangshi testified that Amei was her daughter, who had been living there for three months. Zhang Ayuan was a friend of the monk. He wanted to borrow money but could not, so he thought of this method. At that time, she went into the room but did not know if Qiu Zhongyuan went there. Wang Amei testified that Zhang Ayuan came up with the idea to defraud money. She received 100 yuan afterwards. At this point, the court, needing to investigate further, adjourned the hearing to the 23rd. The defendants were returned to custody. However, Qiu Zhongyuan presented a request to be transferred to the detention center because he was coughing up blood in custody. The court instructed that if he was ill, the police department should send him to the hospital. As the case was still under investigation, the request for transfer was denied. The bailiffs then escorted the defendants away.</p>

<p>To facilitate the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers and goods from foreign ships on the Huangpu River, the Shanghai Industrial Trust plans to construct two steel floating docks and one floating bridge. Yesterday, it issued a notice inviting bids. According to a person in charge of the trust, these floating docks and floating bridge are different from ordinary docks. They can float in the center of the river and will be rented to foreign ships in the future. Because foreign ships are very tall, it is very inconvenient to use small ships to dock for embarkation and disembarkation. These docks have floating [ ], which can be lowered and raised at will, which will be more convenient and safe.</p>

<h3 id="e100">District Branch Representatives of Citizens' Association Offer Telephone Opinions, Requesting Attention to User Interests <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company of the Shanghai International Settlement has repeatedly increased its rates, opposed by various public organizations throughout the city. The Municipal Council has temporarily agreed to a rate increase of 12.5% and established a research committee. Foreign committee members have successively arrived in Shanghai. The First District Branch of the Citizens' Association of the Special District, which has been the most vocal in opposing telephone rate increases, has specifically appointed standing committee members Xu Meiqing and Zhuang Zhihe to visit Hu Ruixiang, the Chinese member of the committee, today. They will request that attention be paid to the interests of users to embody the true spirit of public utilities and facilitate transportation. They will also solemnly state the reasons for their opposition for the committee's consideration. A summary is as follows: (1) Shanghai's situation has deteriorated to an extreme point. Few businesses can barely maintain operations. Further increasing their burden would be difficult to bear. The Shanghai Telephone Company already has profits and performs better than ordinary businesses. It should share the hardships with users and should not necessarily achieve its budgetary goals by raising prices again. (2) Telephones are a public utility, with the purpose of benefiting the public. Profits should be limited. No matter what country, there is no regulation that public utilities must guarantee a certain level of profit. Why does the Shanghai Telephone Company have such a harsh demand, and why must the Municipal Council allow it? (3) In terms of progress, it is difficult for general users to truly understand the actual situation of the Shanghai Telephone Company's profits and losses before they have the opportunity to accurately understand its actual contents. It is also difficult to believe the company's need to increase prices. (4) The Shanghai Telephone Company has declared that it needs to increase prices due to excessive capital investment and huge expenditures. However, according to commercial practice, the higher the price, the more difficult it is to sell. It is better to have small profits and quick turnover for easy promotion. The company only knows how to spend money on advertising and cannot see through society. It is clumsy to seek profit by reducing prices. As for expenditures, it is not necessarily impossible to reduce them. (5) The method of calculating the price increase by call is even more limitless. According to the results of the association's investigation of the actual usage of various users, it will exceed the original price by more than two or three times. Although the Municipal Council has not yet approved it, even allowing an increase of 12.5% is not something that users can afford.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Special District Rickshaw Pullers Gathered Yesterday to Take Over the Mutual Aid Society, and Requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Taxpayers' Association to Attend as Directors; Authorities Persuaded Them to Postpone the Takeover for One Week <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, Special District rickshaw pullers requested the publication of the mutual aid society's accounts. They mass petitioned yesterday, preparing to take over. The authorities persuaded them to stop. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>District Assembly</p>
<p>The rickshaw pullers of the Special District pay a monthly membership fee of 15,000 yuan to the mutual aid society. To date, they have paid a total of 195,000 yuan. They have repeatedly requested the publication of accounts but have not been accepted. Therefore, at eight o'clock yesterday, the rickshaw pullers gathered in five districts (Pudong in Yangshupu, Puxi and Pubei in Jinling Road, Puzhong in Lujiawan, and Punan in Lujiabang Road), totaling more than 5,000 people, preparing to take over the mutual aid society in Jiaxing Road.</p>
<p>Request for Protection</p>
<p>Beforehand, the rickshaw pullers, in order to request protection from the authorities, specifically sent Zhu Fengxiang, chairman of the Rickshaw Pullers Association, and executive committee members Zhu Richang, Dai Rugui, Zhou Hanqing, Lu Deguang, and Sun Shihe, a total of six people, to the Central Police Station to request protection and announced the reasons: (1) Publish the accounts, (2) Announce the procedures for the election of new directors of the mutual aid society, (3) Rickshaw puller directors should be recognized, (4) If the staff members are too busy with association affairs to publish the accounts, please suspend work for a few days to allow for proper reorganization. Chief Inspector Yao Zengmo received them and advised the rickshaw pullers to delay the action and wait for discussion with Deputy Chief Inspector Asmus to seek a proper solution.</p>
<p>Petitions Everywhere</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, directors Cang Gongwen, Xu Zhulin, and standing committee members Xu Buhua, Li Yourong, Bian Weilian, You Muqing, and Ma Taizhi, a total of seven people, first went to the residence of Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing in Haining Road. Because Yu was not present, they went to Foch Road, but he had already gone out. Then they presented a letter to the Sanbei Company, asking Yu to serve as the chairman of the mutual aid society and be responsible for convening a new board of directors. They did not meet him either. Then they sent Xu Zhucai, Lu Deqing, and Cang Gongwen to the Taxpayers' Chinese Association to report the situation and request the appointment of one person each from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpayers' Association to attend as a director of the mutual aid society. Secretary Tao Leqin received them and promised to ask for instructions and handle it.</p>
<p>Postponed Takeover</p>
<p>When the rickshaw puller representatives were petitioning in separate directions, more than 700 rickshaw pullers in Pudong District went to various locations such as Jiaxing Road and Dixiwei Road to wait for news. If there were no satisfactory results, they prepared to take over the mutual aid society. The Jiaxing Road Police Station, upon receiving the report, sent a large number of detectives to maintain order. Until 1:00 PM, the petition representatives returned to report. It was resolved to respect the mediators' wishes and delay the takeover for one week.</p>
<p>Reasons for Takeover</p>
<p>The reasons why the rickshaw pullers prepared to take over the mutual aid society yesterday were that the Municipal Council did not recognize the mutual aid society as an affiliated organization. Repeated direct negotiations had no results. The Taxpayers' Chinese Association replied to the Rickshaw Pullers' Association, saying: "We have received a reply from the Public Concession Municipal Council, a letter dated August 6th regarding the transfer of a letter from the Public Rickshaw Pullers' Association. The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society has its own organization and is not under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council. If there are any letters regarding this issue, it is best to send them directly to the Mutual Aid Society."</p>
<p>Liang and more, 438 liang and more of opium substitutes, two and a half liang of morphine, one hundred and eighty-five liang of heroin, more than two hundred and thirteen opium pipes, and one morphine needle were confiscated. The total amount of fines paid by the opium offenders this month was 7,058 yuan.</p>

Unexpectedly, the gamblers had heard the news in advance and had already dispersed. However, various gambling tools were left behind in the two large rooms upstairs, which led to the inference that it was a large-scale gambling operation. In addition to confiscating the gambling tools and taking the people involved to the police station for questioning, they are currently thoroughly investigating the truth.</p>

<p>At 117 Laji Tang, north of Yangjiadu, Pudong, the home of Ah San, a Taizhou native garbage boss, was broken into by four or five thieves on the evening of the 8th of this month at 7:45 PM, and gold jewelry and silver dollars worth more than 200 yuan were robbed and carried away. Police from the Yangjiadu Police Station ordered the police on duty to pursue them and caught Shao Lizheng, a Shandong native thief. After the police station handed him over to the bureau, the detectives successively arrested the fugitives Liu Decai (also known as Liu Da), Ma Acai, and Liu Xiaosizi (also known as Liu Da's younger brother). Liu confessed that the firearms were hidden in the homes of Liu Zhiquan and Xu Genbao, two brothers from Chenjiamen 6, south of Yangjiadu, Pudong. At 9:30 PM the previous night, the team ordered squad leader Wang Peiting to take the three criminals, Liu Da, Ma Acai, and Liu Xiaosizi, to Pudong and requested assistance from the Yangjiadu Police Station. Director Yang Zhongquan immediately dispatched a senior police officer to assist in the search and arrested Xu Zhiquan and Xu Genbao. A six-inch white keel pistol, numbered 127560, and six bullets were found under the floorboards of Zhiquan's shop. The witnesses were taken to the police station together. Director Yang first interrogated Liu, who confessed that he was 39 years old, from Yancheng. The robbery of Wang Asan's house was carried out by me, Zhang Shunxing (nicknamed Zhang Gong Yatou), Shao Lizheng, and Wang Mou. Only Zhang is still at large. The director, seeing that the criminal was wearing a black short shirt and blue cloth pants, and was not tall, observed that his appearance was very similar to the description of the robber provided by the owner of the Xingchang Rice Store in Nancao Nitan, who was robbed on the 28th of last month. He interrogated him strictly. Liu then confessed that he had robbed the Xingchang Rice Store with Yu Kang, a disciple of San Laoban. Only Yu Liang had the pistols and hand grenades.

The director ordered the three criminals, along with the pistol and bullets, to be handed over to the officer to be interrogated, and reported the situation to the General Bureau for review.</p>

Therefore, Deputy Captain Shi led detectives Li Guiqing, Zhong Da, Mao Gongzhao, and Cai Jilin to wait at the destination with the Xun Dao Street Police Station from the 16th. Until 11:00 AM the previous morning, the detective team, still with the same staff, along with Police Officer Chen Xuemin, Sergeant Liu Maolin, Zhao Shuyan, and Police Officers Su Yiming, Wu Dezong, Li Xinglou, and Wang Yixing of the police station, disguised themselves and lay in wait.

<p>The kidnapping of Xiang Yixing, owner of a sand-turning factory on Hongnan Mountain Road in Zhabei, and the details of the subsequent investigation have been repeatedly reported. Now, the confessions of the captured criminals in this case are detailed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Zhou Shi (i.e., Miss Shi) states: 26 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 7 Yuande Lane, Julai Da Road. I practiced Daoism in the Yixinlu Buddhist hall built by my master (referring to Xiang Yixing). Since my master was kidnapped, his wife and others have been restless day and night, wanting to rescue him. I usually work in a pharmaceutical factory, so I asked my female colleague Wu Xingsheng's wife to ask a man named Chen Bingsheng to help find him. About seven or eight days ago, Chen Bingsheng came to me and said that he had contacted a person named Wang, who had leads, but it would cost at least</p>
<p>500,000 yuan</p>
<p>to redeem him. He also brought a monk's robe worn by my master, a white short shirt, as proof. I took the robe to the Xiang family, and they gave me 200 yuan in banknotes to contact Chen. Later, I met them at Room 7 of the Defeng Western Restaurant at No. 2 Tao'erfeisi Road, Luban Road in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, they captured me. I was really well-intentioned, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Chen Bingsheng states: 48 years old, from Shaoxing, residing in Room 7 of the Defeng Restaurant. More than ten days ago, Miss Shi asked me to inquire about Xiang Yixing. I asked Wang Zhonghong, whom I had worked with in Taicang before. Later, Wang said he had leads, but it would cost 500,000 yuan in silver. He brought the kidnapped person's monk's robe to me to hand over to Miss Shi, and she</p>
<p>gave me 200</p>
<p>yuan in banknotes. I was apprehended while contacting Wang and others in Room 7 of the Defeng Teahouse on Luban Road.</p>
<p>(3) Wu Xingsheng states: 42 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 27 Huangjiabang, Jin Shenfu Road. My wife and Zhou Shi and Zheng Yu work in the same pharmaceutical factory. Zhou and Zheng knew that I was a traveling salesman, so they asked my wife to ask me to inquire about Xiang Yixing. I then encountered Chen Bingsheng and asked him to inquire everywhere. He said a friend named Wang knew about this matter, so I brought Chen to meet with Zhou Shi. Later, Zhou gave him 200 yuan to use for opening a hotel room. Chen also brought a piece of the kidnapped person's clothing as proof, so we opened a room in the restaurant to negotiate, etc.</p>
<p>(4) Li Jinshan states: 52 years old, from Shaoxing, residing in Room 7 of the Defeng Restaurant. I came to Shanghai from my hometown more than ten days ago and met Chen Bingsheng. He told me about a kidnapping case and asked me to run errands with him. In the future, if there is a one million ransom, we</p>

<p>inquire about leads.</p>
<p>Two or three days later, I met Wan at the entrance of the Tianchan Theater. He told me that this kidnapping would cost at least 500,000 yuan. The victim's family owns seven sand-turning factories and three soy sauce shops. I told this to Qiu Zhengping. Later, we talked very closely. The Qiu family took</p>
<p>a statement</p>
<p>(paid by Xiang Yixing's family) as evidence of willingness to pay the ransom. The Wan family took the kidnapped person's short shirt and gave it to me to hand over to the Qiu family, who then handed it over to Miss Shi to deliver to the victim's family for negotiation.</p>

<p>Guo Zibin, a wealthy Chaozhou merchant in Shanghai, founded the Hongzhang Cotton Mill and other industries, possessing assets of millions. His late wife, Zheng, bore him two sons, the eldest named Huatang and the second named Futing. His second wife, Yao, bore him a son named Liangfu. Wang bore him a son named Wenjun. Yang had no children. Finally, he married Fang, who bore him a son named Wenzhong. Because Guo had many children, he had already divided all his assets among his children in his will before his death and allocated a portion of his assets to serve as public assets, and another portion was allocated to charitable causes. On August 21, 1932, Guo Zibin passed away due to illness. The funeral was extremely extravagant at the time. Recently, Guo Huatang, the eldest son of Zibin, suddenly discovered that his stepmother Fang and his brother Futing had misappropriated his private seals, withdrew huge amounts of public funds from the Xinyu Money Exchange, and sold more than 100 HSBC shares. Considering this to be encroachment and breach of trust, he then hired lawyer Ge Ci Dong to file a complaint with the criminal court of the First Special District Court against Fang and Guo Futing. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide opened the first criminal court for a continued hearing. Guo Fang hired lawyers Hua Maosheng and Jiang Yiping. Guo Futing hired lawyer Chen Tingrui for defense. Guo Fang claimed that after Zibin's death, a funeral committee was organized to hold a 100-day funeral. At that time, due to the lack of cash, HSBC shares were mortgaged to the Xinyu Money Exchange to open a credit line account. The funds used were jointly sealed by the plaintiff and his five brothers, and all the funds used were recorded in the account books. She then presented the public account books and the total expenses after Zibin's death as proof. However, Guo Huatang claimed that he had never seen these two account books. The court, with the facts clear, then had lawyer Ge and lawyers Chen Tingrui and Hua Maosheng debate each other. Judge Feng instructed to await a scheduled sentencing.</p>

The styles are modern, the quality is solid, and the prices are extremely low. Therefore, people from all walks of life go to buy them, and they are very crowded. Major companies in Shanghai are also happy to act as agents. Foreign locations such as Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, and Sichuan are also rushing to order goods. Therefore, the goods delivered each time are immediately sold out, resulting in insufficient supply. The company repeatedly sent telegrams to the main factory in Xiao Luzon and the branch factory in Xiamen to urge delivery, but due to transportation reasons, they could not arrive in Shanghai as scheduled. Therefore, there were often no goods for sale. The Chen brothers, feeling this, decided to set up a branch factory in Shanghai in order to produce in large quantities and meet the needs of customers. It is said that the factory site has been found in Xiaodongmen and is currently under preparation. It will soon be able to start manufacturing.

<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>With utmost respect, I write to inform you that upon reading the publication news on the fourth page of today's (August 19th) edition of your esteemed newspaper, it stated that an article by Zhang from the North was published in the "New Shanghai Cartoon." I believe this is a misunderstanding based on rumors. I hope you will correct it. I would be immensely grateful. With best wishes.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhang Ziping of the North, August 19th</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the medical and pharmaceutical communities of Pudong, for the sake of the health of the poor, have jointly organized the Pudong Poor People's Clinic and Dispensary within the Yangjing Temple. The medical and pharmaceutical communities both embrace the spirit of self-sacrifice and service to society, seeking happiness for the poor. Only a small fee of one silver dollar is collected to cover the cost of medicine. All dispensing procedures involve the dispensary issuing vouchers for the poor to collect medicine from various pharmacies, without any charge whatsoever. The poor benefit greatly, and everyone praises this initiative.</p>
<p>Recently, it has come to our attention that unscrupulous individuals are exploiting the name of our organization to solicit donations externally, undermining this charitable cause. This is truly detestable. We deeply fear that outsiders may be deceived. Therefore, we have specially sent a letter to the Pudong Public Security Bureau, instructing them to pay close attention to investigating these matters at any time. We also respectfully request that you, sir, grant us a small space in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your esteemed newspaper to publish this notice and clarify the facts. We would be immensely grateful.</p>

<p>Conclusion of the Yong'an Silver Company Case - Yesterday, Judge Xiao renewed the trial. Lin Kanghou's statements were all "I don't know." Shen Zufu, Wang Yongxin, etc., all had arrest warrants issued.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has been ongoing for over half a year. The court summons has been issued more than ten times. Seventeen directors and managers of the bankrupt Yong'an Silver Company were successively sued by 27 creditor households for fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefen of the First Special District Local Court opened the third court session. Only two defendants were present: Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and secretary-general of the Bankers' Association, who had previously provided a guarantee of 10,000 yuan, and Ou Jiancheng, director and general manager of the company, who had provided a guarantee of 30,000 yuan. The remaining individuals who were appointed as directors or served as managers and assistant managers, including Deng Jinghuan, Wang Jiazhen, Li Du, Zhang Zilian, Qian Youju, Ye Hancheng, Lin Qiuhu, Peng Zhenhui, Jiang Qi, Gu Chuntao, Shen Zufu, Luo Huafang, Wang Yongxin, and Dai Kechang, were all absent. Most of the plaintiffs were represented by lawyers. The judge originally presiding over the case was Wu Zehan. Now, due to Judge Wu's transfer to another court, the vacancy has been filled by Judge Xiao Xiefen. In order to understand the entire case, Judge Xiao announced a renewed trial after the court session began. He also instructed the lawyers representing both the plaintiffs and defendants that there are currently 14 outstanding private prosecutions against the defendants, excluding those that have already been withdrawn or concluded. However, since the implementation of the new Criminal Procedure Law, such private prosecution cases cannot be withdrawn even if the parties reach an out-of-court settlement. Therefore, regardless of whether the cases have been settled out of court, they will still proceed according to the law. Subsequently, each plaintiff or their representative lawyer was questioned about the details of the charges and the amount of money embezzled, and evidence such as deposit books and deposit slips was examined. Most of the deposits were of a fixed, current, or transactional nature. However, the circumstances of the claims pursued by Feng Shunqing and a middle-aged woman were slightly different. According to Feng's lawyer, the amount embezzled from Feng, in addition to a small portion of deposits, consisted of profits earned from entrusting the company to buy large bars of silver and the deposit of security deposits. However, according to defendant Ou Jiancheng, Feng was originally a shareholder. The amount of shares he subscribed for was initially 30,000, but later reduced to 10,000. However, he only paid 3,000 yuan and then wanted to renege on his subscription. Therefore, the remaining 7,000 yuan of share capital was never paid, affecting the progress of other subscribers' payments. Furthermore, all other profits were from his purchase of large bars of silver, and there was no deposit. The defendant could not be held liable for fraud. As for the middle-aged woman, she had mortgaged a total of 30,000 yuan of treasury bonds and public bonds to the company for 11,000 yuan in cash for a term of three months. However, before the redemption period arrived, the company went out of business. Although the period for redemption had arrived when the company resumed business, the company had privately sold the collateral without authorization, so when the woman prepared funds for redemption, she was not able to have the items returned. During the court hearing, defendants Ou Jiancheng and Lin Kanghou were interrogated. Lin replied to every question with "I don't know." Ou did not have much objection to the amounts pursued by the plaintiffs. The court further questioned Ou as to why the company only registered in the United States and did not apply for registration with the Ministry of Finance of the country, given that it had advertised a capital of one million. After Ou's defense, the debate began. Some plaintiffs declared that they would withdraw the prosecution against Lin Kanghou, while others argued that since Lin served as a director, he should be held jointly liable with Ou for fraud. After the lawyers for Ou and Lin presented their defenses, Judge Xiao issued arrest warrants for defendants Shen Zufu and Wang Yongxin, who had consistently failed to appear. The plaintiffs were instructed to apprehend them. For defendants whose addresses were unknown and could not be served, public notice was given. Lin and Ou were each released on their original bail, and a date was set for sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e139">This City's Year 24 Implementation Plan for Compulsory Education Requires a Total Annual Expenditure of Over 180,000 Yuan to Gradually Enable Out-of-School Children to Attend School <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>It is estimated that there are approximately 70,000 out-of-school children in this city's district. The Municipal Education Bureau has formulated a compulsory education implementation plan to be implemented starting in Year 24.  A Compulsory Education Committee has been organized to carry out the plan. The implementation plan is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>A. Implementation Methods</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are approximately 70,000 out-of-school children in this city's district (excluding the Special District).  Starting in Year 24, the first phase of compulsory education will be implemented, with approximately 14,000 (one-fifth of the total) out-of-school children required to be enabled to attend school each year. In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Outline of Compulsory Education Implementation Measures, the following matters shall be implemented:</p>
<p>Short-Term Elementary Schools</p>
<p>(1)  Establish one-year short-term elementary schools and attached short-term elementary school classes.  Starting in Year 24, it is planned to establish 20 short-term elementary schools, each with morning, noon, and evening classes, and 90 short-term elementary school classes attached to ordinary elementary schools, totaling 150 classes. Each class will enroll 50 students, accommodating a total of 7,500 students.  The monthly recurring expenses for each short-term elementary school are estimated at 80 yuan, totaling 19,200 yuan per year. The start-up cost for each school is estimated at 200 yuan, totaling 4,000 yuan. The monthly recurring expenses for each attached short-term elementary school class are estimated at 24 yuan, totaling 25,920 yuan per year.  The cost of books and supplies is estimated at 1 yuan per student per year, totaling 7,500 yuan.  The total cost is 56,620 yuan in silver.</p>
<p>Promoting Junior Elementary Schools</p>
<p>(1) Promote junior elementary schools.  In Year 24, it is planned to add six elementary schools, such as restoring Lu Bin Elementary School at Longhua New Village Elementary School, establishing an elementary school on land donated by Jiang Zuozhou in Yangjing District, adding an elementary school at Yangshupu where Wang Zengyou built school buildings, and incorporating the private Anguo Dadongxi Compulsory Elementary School as a municipal school.  It is planned to operate single-grade classes in two schools, two-grade classes in one school, and three-grade classes in three schools, totaling 13 grades, accommodating 650 students. The monthly expenses for a single-grade class are 100 yuan, for a two-grade class 160 yuan, and for a three-grade class 240 yuan, totaling 12,960 yuan per year.  The start-up cost is 200 yuan per grade, totaling 2,600 yuan.  The total cost is 15,560 yuan in silver.</p>
<p>Expanding School Grades</p>
<p>(3) Expanding the grades of existing elementary schools.  In Year 23, there were a total of 44,286 elementary school students in the city, with 798 grades, averaging 55.5 students per grade, which is already extremely crowded. In practice, it is impossible to further expand the capacity of existing grades.  In Year 24, it is planned to add 40 grades to existing grades, with each grade accommodating 50 students, totaling 2,000 students.  The monthly recurring expenses for each grade are approximately 80 yuan, totaling 38,400 yuan per year. The start-up cost is 100 yuan per grade, totaling 8,000 yuan.  The total cost is 46,400 yuan in silver.</p>
<p>Implementing a Two-Shift System</p>
<p>(4)  Vigorously implement a two-shift system.  This city has had a four-grade two-shift system, but its implementation has been hindered. Therefore, it was only piloted in schools such as He'an.  Starting in Year 24, it is planned to add 36 grades, with each grade accommodating 100 students, totaling 3,600 students. The monthly recurring expenses for each grade are approximately 100 yuan, totaling 43,200 yuan per year. The start-up cost is 200 yuan per grade, totaling 7,200 yuan. The total cost is 50,400 yuan in silver.</p>
<p>Improving Private Schools</p>
<p>(5) Improving private schools.  According to a survey conducted by dispatched personnel, approximately 250 private schools in the city have registered with the bureau.  The shortcomings of private schools are: (1) School buildings are not sanitary enough; (2) Equipment is too simple; (3) Teachers' knowledge is too low. Each school will be given a subsidy of 20 yuan per year to expand equipment, renovate school buildings, purchase reference books, and allow teachers to visit nearby excellent schools for observation. This totals 5,000 yuan per year.  In addition, the establishment of a private school teacher training class requires 3,580 yuan, totaling 8,580 yuan in silver.</p>
<p>Mobile Education</p>
<p>(6) Piloting mobile education.  Pilot mobile education vehicles will go deep into rural areas to work. It is planned to first establish five vehicles for pilot operation. If each vehicle teaches 50 students, 350 students can be taught. Each vehicle will be responsible for one teacher, with a provisional monthly salary of 30 yuan, totaling 1,800 yuan per year. Each vehicle will employ one driver, with a monthly salary of 16 yuan, totaling 720 yuan per year, totaling 2,520 yuan. The manufacturing cost for each vehicle is approximately 50 yuan, totaling 250 yuan.  The total cost is 2,770 yuan in silver.

<p>The friendship between the two of them is very deep; even if someone laughs at Little Qiao for being affectionate to Little Mei, he will not stop because of it. He bravely protects her from being bullied by others, and he doesn't understand why boys are embarrassed to always say ""I love"" their sisters. Little Mei also loves her ""compatriot"" brother, thinking that ""my brother"" is the most amazing boy in the world. Every morning, before changing out of her pajamas, she quickly walks to his door, knocks on the door, and says in her mother's tone—"Get up, my precious, it's almost morning; here is your clean collar"".</p>
<p>"Robert is an energetic boy, he seems to have discovered the secret of ""constant movement"", because he never sits still. Fortunately, he is not naughty or very brave; so he doesn't cause much trouble. He constantly goes back and forth between his father and mother, just like an affectionate pendulum, and it is also ticking, because Robert is really a lively ""talking box"".</p>
<p>""Tandy is too young to be an important figure in Mei Manor, but he also has his small duties, and he is very commensurate with them. Everyone sometimes feels the need for a pet, and Bao is always ready to accommodate, kissing and hugging are most suitable for his taste. Mrs. Lie hardly does anything without taking him along; so everything in the family has his share, but everyone loves him more for it, because the people of Mei Manor all believe in Little Bao.</p>

<p>Society often uses the names of objects to scold people, to show frivolousness and contempt. In fact, the objects referred to are beneficial to us, so why despise them? A brief description is given below.</p>
<p>Candle  People often call those who are not very clever in doing things or are often deceived by others "candles"! In fact, the candle itself always sacrifices its entire life, giving light and convenience to others. We should admire its spirit of self-sacrifice and benefiting others, but society insults it instead, I don't know what the reason is?</p>
<p>Rice Bucket  People often call those who are naturally mediocre or not very sensible "rice buckets"! It must be known that a rice bucket is used to hold three meals of porridge and rice for people to eat. For the sake of survival, no one can do without food and drink for a day. Then the rice bucket has great achievements for the crowd, so why despise it?</p>

<p>That was a wasteland. Three years ago, it was still a rubble field. According to the older people, that rubble field used to be a large house. Because the descendants in the large house declined, it was never rebuilt after a fire.</p>
<p>In the year three years ago, the neighbors were spreading the news that the wasteland had been sold. One owner bought the entire square, measuring more than four mu of land. One owner bought the narrow strip on the southeast corner, measuring more than eight fen and seven li of land.</p>
<p>A few days later, the two owners successively built houses on the newly bought land. On the more than four mu of land, a Spanish-style Western house was built. There were lawns around, as well as well-arranged flowers and trees. The construction project took a full eight months to complete. But the house built on the narrow strip of land was completed in only two months, because this family's house was a row of nine-bay tile bungalows. On all the remaining land, the rubble was just leveled a little, and everything was simple.</p>
<p>After the houses of the two families were built, they successively moved in. The family living in the Western-style house was said to be involved in politics, so the owner never paid attention to anyone when going in and out. Even the servants were somewhat indifferent to the neighbors. But the family living in the bungalow, the foreman's family, was very friendly and often interacted with the neighbors.</p>
<p>Last year, the owner of the Western-style house did not know what he had done wrong, lost his official position, and died in a hurry. It was said that he was still in debt after his death, so the Western-style house was immediately transferred to the real estate company. At the same time! The family living in the bungalow, because they were preparing to marry a daughter-in-law, added two rooms to the remaining land.</p>
<p>For a time, the neighbors looked at the Western-style house, looked at the bungalow, and would sigh slightly.</p>

<p>The sun's weak, gentle rays slant across the rooftops and eaves of the city, retaining only their golden hue, lacking the fierce intensity of midday.</p>
<p>The pedestrians on the streets are especially crowded, adding to the bustling atmosphere. The red and green traffic lights change like the blinking of an eye. The traffic police, directing traffic, blow their whistles, the "dee-loo," "dee-loo" sounds constantly vibrating through the air.</p>
<p>"Ke-dang," "ke-dang," the trams run one after another, and at each stop, a batch of passengers surges out, followed by another batch挤挤on, so that there is no space to put a foot down inside the carriages, but the platforms are still full of people waiting. Newspaper boys, shouting their sales pitches like reciting familiar phrases, weave through the crowds. Seeing a tram approaching, they swarm forward, holding out evening papers from the windows, shouting with extra vigor. Eventually, the hands that were stretched out retract, clutching copper coins, their faces naturally beaming, their hearts full of joy. The unfortunate children still clutching their newspapers gaze blankly at the tram driving away, left with no choice but to wait for future luck.</p>
<p>Inside shops displaying banners advertising huge discounts, Western-style drums are being beaten. The radio broadcasts soothing music, which blends with the sounds of vehicles and horses into the evening symphony of the city.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Shanghai's "Pulling" <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>The skill with which Shanghainese "pull" others is truly admirable. If the second landlord's wife, the "good wife" in the side room, and the nanny in the attic decide they want to play mahjong, then the sister-in-law upstairs will invariably be "pulled" to complete the table. However, simply "pulling" is not enough; "pulling" accompanied by witty words is more effective. Thus, the saying "three short of one is bad luck" is uttered, and no "pull" ever fails. Because "pulling" is so wonderful, people who live by "pulling" have emerged.</p>
<p>Every evening, as the lights begin to illuminate, you'll find women with rouge and powder on their faces, acting as enchanting figures weaving through the crowd, their妖形怪狀 and throwing flirtatious glances, grabbing at passersby's sleeves and saying, "Come to my place for fun!" This kind of "pulling" is both firm and gentle, and those who are "pulled" in this way can have their meal expenses for the day taken care of. However, few people pay them any attention, and they can't force their "pulling", making them hateful yet pitiable.</p>
<p>Also, whenever one takes a rickshaw and passes places like Garbage Bridge, small urchins will come up and say, "Sir, let me give you a 'pull'!" and they'll help the rickshaw pull the carriage uphill, hand-in-hand. Once they're done, you have to give them a copper coin. If you refuse, they'll curse you behind your back, calling you "pig," and "old beast", as if it's a kind of "bridge toll" that cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the economic downturn, the second-hand clothing stores on Shilu Road have also been facing misfortune. Several store owners and employees, anxious and restless, stand inside and outside their counters, clapping bamboo clappers and loudly shouting "Big Discount!" If a passerby glances at the clothes hanging in front of the store, an employee will rush up, grab you, and ask, "What do you need? Sir, we have Indian silk, poplin, everything is here! Don't leave!" This looks as if they are taking you for a big customer, grabbing you and not letting go, so you have to put some effort into twisting your body to get out of their hands. This frightens me so much that I never dare to look again when I pass by next time, to avoid more trouble.</p>
<p>Shanghai's tricks of "pulling" are truly admirable yet fearful!</p>

<p>The next day, he got up early and put on his long gown and mandarin jacket, sometimes running inside, sometimes running outside, as if he had lost his soul and had no idea what to do. Because he was always going in and out like this, and he was wearing a mandarin jacket, he attracted the attention of everyone in the hotel. Later, the waiter said that this was Zhang Jiefu, who was putting up slogans. Everyone understood that he was busy preparing for the welcoming event. But apart from seeing him running around, there was no sign of any welcoming ceremony, so no one knew what he was up to. This was the observers' perspective. In fact, Jiefu himself didn't know why he was running around. After twelve o'clock, he was looking to see if the car had arrived. After twelve o'clock, he knew that the car couldn't arrive, so why bother to look? Finally, after two o'clock in the afternoon, there was a commotion in front, and a car drove up. Jiefu hurried to the front to inquire and learned that it was the people sent by the provincial capital to Liuguan to welcome the commissioner, carrying the commissioner's luggage, who had arrived first. It was said that Commissioner Lan and two representatives had gone to Huaqing Pool Hot Springs for a bath and wouldn't arrive for another hour or two. This suited Jiefu's intentions perfectly. He immediately found the messenger escorting the luggage, smiled, and asked, "Excuse me, did Commissioner Lan bring a Secretary Qiu with him?" The messenger said, "No, there is a Secretary Qiu, but he is also in Lintong." Jiefu said, "Ah! It would have been good if he had come first." As he spoke, he accompanied the messenger, pointing out where to place the luggage. The messenger assumed that he was a receptionist sent by the local government, so naturally, he let him handle the reception without objecting. (294)</p>

<p>Third, even though we add lead powder to our type of face powder to keep it from clumping together, just like is done on the outside, we add only a very, very small amount, just enough to keep it from clumping. But face powder made outside the palace walls is often made with lead that's been added without any restraint, so after using it for a year or two, people often deeply suffer from lead poisoning, their faces gradually turning blue, and their skin becoming rough. And some types of face powder even cause a person's face to turn black without them realizing it! If our faces suddenly turned black during court sessions, wouldn't that become a huge joke?!"</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager's sense of humor was sometimes very meaningful. Just imagine, if a solemn and dignified Empress Dowager suddenly appeared with a black face in front of her ministers, wouldn't that be laughably deadly? I imagined this scene, and I almost burst out laughing, but I could only endure it. I dared not laugh, because if I laughed, she would see it in the mirror, and she might force me to explain why it was so funny. How would I answer that?</p>
<p>Although her powder was so elaborate, she used very little of it, unlike ordinary women who would apply a white face that looked like Cao Cao's face. She only applied a very thin layer, which was probably one of her "beauty secrets."</p>
<p>"The rouge we use," she continued, "is even more elaborate to manufacture than the powder. It is made purely from the juice of roses. Rose juice isn't anything rare. It's used a lot in ordinary rouges. But our specialty lies in careful selection." (394)</p>

<h3 id="e157">A Spider with Amazing Strength <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Don't think that a spider is just a small creature in the arthropod class; its strength is far greater than that of a tall, six-foot man. According to zoologists, if its body were as large as a human's, it could easily lift a house with two floors and a roof, like it's nothing. Could a tall, six-foot man do that? So we can say with certainty that a spider's strength is greater than a human's.</p>
<p>In the London Zoo in England, there were two large Ceylonese spiders, the male named "Extreme Meter" and the female named "Sussex." They suddenly disappeared a few years ago, and for twelve months, there was no news of them. Everyone thought they were dead, but a year later, they suddenly returned to the zoo. So some people said that this spider couple probably went somewhere for a honeymoon trip and then rested for a while before returning hand-in-hand. The zoo keepers were naturally very happy. It is said that they lifted a thick piece of glass on the cage when they left. The glass weighed at least two pounds. They both had to use their full strength to lift it up in order to escape. These two spiders were originally from the high mountains of Ceylon. They build huge webs between large trees and rocks, with diameters of up to five feet, and the silk at both ends is ten to twelve feet long, about as thick as lead wire. Birds as large as swallows and larks often get caught in the webs and are eaten by them. Even lizards that people are afraid of have to become their snacks if they get caught in their webs. Their jaws are unusually strong and powerful, like a bird's beak, but they are not poisonous, so humans don't have to be afraid of them.</p>
<p>An English zoologist was walking beside a ditch one day when he saw a large black spider in the ditch, standing there motionless. He found it strange, so he stopped to take a closer look and saw that the spider was catching fish. After a while, it had already bitten onto a fish. Although the fish was not very big, it was more than eight times larger than the spider itself. The spider's fangs were biting the fish's spine tightly, not letting go. The fish struggled desperately, trying to drag the spider into the water, but the spider's hind legs were clinging to the embankment, resisting with force. The fish finally couldn't defeat it and was captured by the spider, which slowly chewed and ate it. Within fifteen minutes, it had achieved complete victory. The spider's great strength can be imagined.</p>
<p>There was also a spider, whose body was only the size of a pea, that built a web on a tall tree. One morning, a mouse half an inch long got caught in the web and couldn't escape. It took the spider a full three hours to wrap its silk around the mouse's tail, tightening it more and more. Finally, it hung the mouse high in the air, which, needless to say, was another full meal for it.</p>
<p>Spiders are not only amazing in their strength but also understand music, and understand the best music. According to reports from the London Zoo, whenever a black spider heard famous music played on the radio, it would crawl out of its hiding place and squat on top of the radio, listening carefully while swaying its body as if keeping time with the music. When the music stopped, it would immediately retreat. The strangest thing is that it only likes the music of the old masters. Sometimes, when it heard jazz music on the radio, it would quickly run away, clearly expressing its disgust. Modern men and women love jazz music in dance halls, and don't seem to appreciate the music of the old masters as much as a small spider does. Hehe!</p>

<h3 id="e158">Market Chatter: Lack of Support, Bid Price Drops Another Twelve Yuan and Six Cents—Once Falling Below the 870 Yuan Mark— <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market continued its downward trend due to weak investor confidence and rumors of profit-taking, breaking the 70 Yuan mark again. Sassoon's active forex support and softer Hong Kong prices prompted a rebound, but investor confidence in the market remained pessimistic despite the sharp fall in Indian silver. At the opening this morning, overseas silver prices were up in London but flat in the US, with the forward price of silver in Montevideo rising by three per cent. Exchange rates rose slightly and the price of gold in London rose by one and a half pence. However, investor sentiment was weak. Added to this was the fact that in last night's off-market trading, the price had already fallen to 76-77 Yuan due to rumors of the successful Sino-British loan agreement. As a result, the pre-market opening price fell to 77 Yuan. Fuxingyong was the first to sell aggressively, causing the price to fall to 74-75 Yuan, but some took advantage of the low prices to buy, pushing the price up to 76 Yuan. Fuxingyong, Chunyuanyong, Dada, Shenfeng, Danchang, Yonghui, Xiangda, and all sold, causing the price to fall further to 72-73 Yuan. Dada, Huixiang, Hengyu, Wanyu, and Lichang purchased at low prices, raising the price to 74-75 Yuan. The Central Bank's posted exchange rates were flat for both the UK and the US, and the customs gold unit rose by four basis points. As a result, the bid price standard was raised to 932.2 Yuan, which was stable after the opening. However, the exchange rate market was weak, with both Huashang and Xinfeng Foreign Company selling heavily, pushing the price below the 70 Yuan mark. Expecting the HSBC exchange rate to be announced, it was anticipated that the UK would rise by 125 and the US would rise by 25, but it fell further. The bank took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and buyers began to provide support, gradually pushing the price back above 70 Yuan. Hong Kong prices tightened, and Sassoon suddenly supported forex, causing the domestic market to tighten and stabilize, but it still hesitated and broke the 70 Yuan mark again. Helplessly, Sassoon and the bank continued to buy in, boosting buying sentiment and finally pushing the price up. Huashang's sentiment remained weak, and they sold to take profits. Sellers were eager to sell again at high prices, and the upward trend was then blocked, gradually moving downstream and approaching the 70 Yuan mark. It was forecast that Indian silver would fall by fifteen annas, resulting in a small rise. The afternoon situation was uncertain. Later in the market, the bank continued to buy, pushing the price up and sideways. Hong Kong prices were also soft. Fortunately, Indian silver was up by only nineteen annas, which was enough to hold the price up, but it soon weakened again. However, the situation was very flat. Indian silver rose again by a small four annas for the second time, resulting in only a slight rise. In the end, the market was unable to boost investor sentiment, and those who wanted to sell sold one after another. Finally, the price fell below 70 Yuan again. The spread between spot and forward prices rose further to one Yuan, as short positions watched and long positions panicked. Here is a record of the day's market conditions.</p>

Aside from rumors of hedging outside the market, some were preparing to take delivery. The number of chips within the market still seemed depleted, with a slight short squeeze. Arbitrage trading was gradually initiated. Series 16, 21, and 47, etc., saw some covering. There was news that Director Wang was returning to Beijing, and the political situation did not seem to be changing. There was a possible short squeeze on the market price prospect. Yesterday, the two morning sessions showed a strong upward trend, while the two afternoon sessions saw a slight pullback. Initially, because various groups slightly covered their positions, market prices gradually rose. Series 48 also saw a small amount of buying. Demand from the northern groups was very strong. Salt tax gold shortages and the increase in Series 22 were the most significant. In the afternoon, bulls sold when the price rose, and there was a slight pullback. However, the closing forward for Zhengliu (正六) saw a rebound, and the trend was not easy to reverse. The market price results mostly increased by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 3 jiao.

<p>The yarn market remains calm, but industry insiders are extremely optimistic, mainly because too many yarn factories have stopped work and production has been reduced. At the same time, the spot yarn sales market has recently seen progress. Tianjin merchants are actively purchasing, so many people are buying to go long. However, financial conditions have not been very relaxed, and commodity prices are difficult to rise excessively. Moreover, inland commerce remains depressed. Most noteworthy is that the prices of Japanese yarn lines, 42-count and 20-count, are gradually converging with those of Chinese yarn, with a difference of only 2-3 yuan or 5-6 yuan.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Still Level</p>
<p>At the opening of the labeled yarn market, the price of labeled gold continued to fall, and people's hearts were slightly empty. Prices for all months fell by 5-6 jiao, but all were in the 2-3 pan (盤, refers to trading levels). It was heard that spot yarn consumption was still not bad, and most industry insiders unanimously looked bullish. The market suddenly rebounded, and as a result, this month fell by 2 jiao, September rose by 2 jiao, and distant months remained unchanged. At the afternoon opening, it was heard that the Tianjin group was purchasing spot yarn, and Changfeng also came to pull in. However, bulls in the securities group closed their positions, and the market appeared tighter. Near months continued to rise by 2, 3, or 5 jiao, but after being auctioned to 2 or 3 pan, some bulls closed their positions, and the table became loose and flooded, and the market price weakened again. However, spot yarn trading for the Tianjin group was quite smooth. As a result, near months fell by 4 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and distant months fell by 1, 2, or 3 jiao. It was found that Dafu sold 500 bales, Jinchang 1,300 bales, Shenji 750 bales, Yongda 250 bales, Yuanyi 400 bales, Hengchang 300 bales, and Xincheng 300 bales. Changfeng bought 2,300 bales, Yida 550 bales, Tongji 200 bales, Deji 250 bales, Senkang 350 bales, and Minghua 250 bales.

<p>New cotton is said to have a bumper harvest in the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang due to recent suitable weather conditions, so the Ningbo group is selling short, with chips of about 600-700 dan. As a result, the table is slack, the situation is slightly soft, and the decline is intensified by the drop in the price of labeled gold. People's hearts are especially frustrated, but the Han group and local cotton merchants are calmly holding their long positions.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Falls</p>
<p>At the opening of the labeled cotton market, August was still level, but prices for distant months for new cotton were slack. The market was tired because there was a lack of new buyers. The Ningbo group has been selling very actively for several days, and the price of labeled gold has fallen. Popular sentiment has weakened. As for this month, it is still changing. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, August saw an increase of 1 jiao, but prices for distant months remained level. Purchases of new cotton were particularly scarce, and labeled gold was also hovering at a low peak. However, the big long position holders have not yet emerged. As a result, prices for unmatured months were the same as the morning closing price. Continued declines of 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao for successive months. It was found that Dafu sold 1,500 dan, Hexing 2,000 dan, Tongxing 1,900 dan, Changfeng 1,300 dan, Runkang 2,900 dan, Dachang 600 dan, and Yuanyuchang 600 dan. Jifeng bought 900 dan, Dafu 1,600 dan, Taichang 600 dan, Yichang 1,800 dan, Changhe 2,800 dan, and Yikang 700 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Demand Is Weak</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is becoming more bleak. Factory demand is not strong. The source is estimated to be 830 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<p>Lingbao cotton: 49.25 large items from Dakang factory entered and 100 items of spot goods were sent to the factory.</p>

<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The cotton yarn situation in this city is calm and flat. Sales to customers are quiet. Only the northeast road is slightly more active. Transactions with other groups are few. The Tianjin factory Shayang River group bought 15 bales of 16-count Bama yarn at a price of 171 yuan. The Baodi group bought 30 bales of 17-count Bama yarn at a price of 171 yuan to 171 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Active Spot Sales of Indian Cotton Last Week <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Last week, most bulls closed their positions in seven or eight-month Bairoxi cotton, so the price difference with the four or five-month period gradually approached. After once falling, many expected a rebound. Fortunately, US cotton was firm, so there was short covering and buying from industry players. Spot cotton was more active. Transporters inquired about Pingguoer cotton. Japan and the mainland paid attention to Aomula new cotton. According to reports, the cloth market has increased shipments. The harvest situation is quite complicated. Some cotton-producing areas are in great need of rain, but generally speaking, it can be called satisfactory. Appendix Weekly Statistics are as follows: (Unit: Thousands of Bales)</p>

<h3 id="e168">Grains: New Early Pointed Rice from South Port Is On The Market; New Rice From Ningbo And Guangdong Has Arrived <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice from the south (Shanghai South) from various sources arrived in the 22nd and 23rd (actually a total of more than 4,000 shih). Sales in the local market began, but only the Qingdao group had 200-300 bags. Because people’s hearts are still high, the situation can be slightly improved. The market is slightly tight, and as a result, the prices of various thick japonica rice and thin indica rice have rebounded slightly. Du Yang pointed rice and Yin Yuan rice are both slightly tight. Dongxin high-grade materials are neither good nor bad. New early pointed rice from South Port was on the market yesterday, opening at 7 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) There are sources from various routes for more than ten days. Sales of white pointed rice on the market were still stagnant in the morning, but later, because the store stomach (店胃, a term for business) turned active, the price turned firm. Early japonica rice and thin fixed momentum. Dongxin japonica rice has both arrivals and sales. The price is slightly 2 jiao. More than 30 stones of new Chuan Pointed rice from Qingpu arrived, the rice quality is quite good, the price opened at 9 yuan and 1 jiao. New customer-pointed rice continues to be transported by train and dismantled continuously, and the price is fixed. White Yuan rice has both arrivals and sales, and the market situation is fixed. The remaining goods have not changed much.</p>
<p>Customer indica market conditions are mixed. 667 bags of brown rice loaded from Ningbo River were all handled by this street. Anhui indica rice and car indica rice have both arrived, and 400 bags of new rice newly arrived from Guangdong were all not sold. Guangdong rice is similar in shape to Saigon No. 1 rice. The selling price must be above 10 yuan. Foreign rice is affected by new rice from various routes, and the owners are mostly planning to sell, so the price continues to be slightly 5-6 fen to Jiao Xu. After the price is lower, this street handled more than 4,000 bags of Saigon small twisted rice. Inland and Ningbo gangs handled 1,500-1,600 bags of broken rice from Siam, Gao Gong, and Xishi. The latter situation is still flat.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Flour Mills Actively Hedge Future Sales <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, the market atmosphere was already depressed. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell around 4-6 jiao, Canada fell 2-7 jiao. The market was mindful of the fall in foreign wheat and the fact that the actual sales in the north were very little moved. Furthermore, because of the bumper harvest of early crops in various parts of Jiangnan, part of the people could not help but think of this, so there were very few buyers, and it fell about one point. Until the afternoon, the decline in various months was even more severe. It was heard that because the mills' destocking was not smooth, the hedging of forward sales was quite active, and customers' intentions were even more silent at this time. Only 170,000 yuan was traded in the morning, and more than 300,000 yuan was traded in the afternoon. According to the chips issued by the factories, the next step may have to be tired again. As a result, this month fell by 2 fen, September fell by 3 fen, October and November fell by 3 fen and 3 li and a half, December fell by 2 fen and 7 li and a half, and January fell by 3 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Spot and Future Wheat Show Weakness <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the market atmosphere for all months was consistently flat and weak. Foreign wheat quotations in Chicago and Canada both fell by 2, 4, 6, or 7 jiao, causing market sentiment to be weak. Furthermore, because the factories have recently imported foreign wheat, the destocking of domestic wheat will naturally be affected. As for the flour sales market, there was neither prosperity nor humiliation, so the wheat market had to turn weak. However, the combined prices in various producing areas are still difficult to loosen. This situation must be rejected for a long time before it can follow suit a little bit. As a result, August and September fell by 4 fen, and October and November fell by 5 fen. In the spot wheat market, because customers are unwilling to reject it for a long time, it has decreased by 2-3 fen compared to the previous week. Special high-grade goods open at 3 yuan and 7 jiao. Intermediate and secondary grades will be reduced accordingly. Fufeng handles more than 10,000 bags, and Shenda and Xinda each handle more than 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e171">New Soybeans Fall Another 5-6 Fen <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for new soybeans, Jiujiang glutinous rice in this province was high in the producing areas, transportation was not profitable, and sources were not abundant. The market price looked high, but when the state cowhide soybeans arrived in large quantities (currently, about 2,000 bags are stored), the identity was superior to Jiujiang soybeans, and the selling price was also cheaper, so the sellers were not greedy, and the market price of new soybeans fell uniformly by 5-6 fen. It is estimated that 400 bags of Changzhou cowhide yellow soybeans were sold at a price of 3 yuan, 6 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half. 130 bags of Chengmendou were sold at a price of 3 yuan, 7 jiao and 6 jiao. 122 bags of Jiangqiaodou were sold at a price of 3 yuan, 6 jiao and 3 jiao and 6 jiao. Jiangqiaodou was handled by the Fuzhou gang, and the rest were all collected by this street.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Wall Street was closed, but the Japanese Yokohama silk market continued to rise wildly. Spot and short-term futures have exceeded the 800 yuan mark, and long-term futures are also far above 790 yuan. As a result, Shanghai's 20.22 white silk also rose to a new high price of 550 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the psychology of the manufacturers became more persistent, and no one was willing to sell. At the same time, the cocoon market was also soaring. It is said that the asking price for improved seed dry cocoons is 130 yuan per load, and the asking price for local seed cocoons is 95 yuan per load. Because many manufacturers have no cocoons on hand, the rise in the cocoon market is even more intense than the silk market.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Pulled Core Treasures Sell Slightly <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the French merchants for pulled-core Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi were slightly destocking. Yongxing, Baochang, Fulin, and other foreign firms were also starting to handle business due to foreign demand. However, because the market has been weak for many days, the selling price has fallen by 3-4 yuan compared to before. Jinlong Foreign Firm also slightly replenished the Ma Zhufeng Mei, Emei, and Baozhu Mei, and other varieties that were dismantled from the big gang, and the price did not fluctuate. There is still no major progress in the wholesale of Zhenmei green tea.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Sugar Market: Tender Sales of Guangdong Sugar Are Many, But Transactions Are Small <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the sugar market association's drawing, a small amount of rough white granulated sugar spot goods were sold at 17 yuan and 2 jiao and 2 fen. Transit goods were called 5 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, but not completed. Taikoo sugar and domestic soft white sugar lacked ups and downs. Sugar Industry Cooperative Society tendered slightly inferior Guangdong rough white more than 2,000 bags at 16 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, only 100 bags were sold. Guangdong medium granulated white 1,000 bags at 16 yuan and a half, 10 bags were sold. Another 2,000 bags of Dutch rough white at 17 yuan and 2 jiao, 170 bags were sold.

<p>Since the golden needle vegetables turned down, sales have been quite active, and the inventory has gradually become thin. However, the current inventory in the producing areas is drier than before, and most are unwilling to sell at the market price, so the trend has turned tight. A total of more than 600 bags of goods were opened in Shanghai in the past two days, at a price of 14 yuan to 12 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Two Tendencies of Criticism <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Yuan</p>
<p>Professor Croce has a collection of criticisms called "Poetry and Non-Poetry," in which he discusses twenty-six European writers. We have already seen the outlines of his theory in his famous work "Aesthetics." This collection can be said to be a concrete application of his theory. What I find interesting is the essay on Balzac. Because of Balzac's tendency to describe human activities through social environment, he also touched on modern French literary criticism. He said: "I would place the French psychological or impressionistic critics before the didactic and systematizing critics, and place Sainte-Beuve and Lamartine before Taine and Brunetière." Why? "Because these latter are all biased towards theory and are obscured by a kind of intellectual and arbitrary spirit, which constitutes an obstacle to understanding art." He believed that Brunetière did not understand even the most superficial reason, and that the so-called "social novel" was not an art form, but only a dogma. (All the above quotations are from the English translation)</p>
<p>From his argument, we can see two different critical attitudes; Croce and Lamartine, whom he admires, tend to be subjective and impressionistic, starting from the heart and explaining literary phenomena to the outside world. As for Taine and others, they advocate objectivity and positivism, using the external environment to explain its impact on internal activities. Literary criticism can be divided into subjective and objective types according to its own development process, and the degree of development is higher for the latter than the former. No matter how much the former tries to "justify itself," it cannot avoid the metaphysical implications of talking about metaphysics; the latter, in its eagerness to create a system, may sometimes inevitably force facts to fit theory and be subject to arbitrary and mechanical knowledge. However, that kind of positivistic and explanatory spirit can often coincide with the most reasonable modern criticism and converge into a new mainstream, advancing towards a scientific and perfect realm. Because the former is based on an unstable foundation, people can each hold a different view, while the latter can use facts as a touchstone, gradually criticizing, eliminating, reforming, repairing, and approaching the truth that is evident to all.</p>
<p>Croce's theory advocates intuition and advocates breaking the notion of taking the environment of the times as an element of criticism. He believed that art is free and creative and can only be discussed in terms of art itself. However, Taine and others, on the contrary, insisted on seeking explanations from the objective environment of art, and believed that literature is evolutionary and historical and cannot exist in isolation. Therefore, they constantly declared war on the tendency of "art for art's sake." If they were inspired by positivist philosophy, the theory of evolution, and the natural sciences of the time, then Croce precisely expressed a "reaction" to these theories, which has much in common with the vitalism of French and German philosophy; because the starting points are different, the arguments are naturally on separate paths and can never take the same path. However, in my opinion, the abuses of the Taine school are at most that some vulgar literary historians in France regard Taine's theory as the golden rule, unable to measure the advantages and disadvantages of his theory, and unable to further invent his theory, but simply "stiffly" and mechanically" incorporate the incoming literary phenomena into the categories of race, era, and environment, degenerating into arbitrary and superficial. The abuses of Croce and others, on the other hand, will be like the school of Spingarn in the United States, who believe that all expressions are beautiful, vigorously advocate creative criticism, talk emptily and irrelevantly, and only engage in theoretical gossip.</p>
<p>Without mentioning anything else, let's take Croce's writing as an example, in which he said that ancient dramas did not go beyond the limits of studying and portraying ordinary human nature. "But when it came to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the social struggles and changes and the rising historical interest, on the one hand, echoed on the comedy, making it express a certain social and historical environment, and on the other hand, occupied the novel, turning it into a 'historical' and 'social' novel." He said that Balzac "does not hope to limit himself to simple observation, but to discover the reasons and laws of social phenomena, and further to trace and evaluate the principles of goodness, truth, and beauty." But what are these changes for? What is the "cause" of these things? Croce only described these phenomena without revealing the latent causes and meanings, which would not satisfy people. To be honest, in order to give a clear explanation of these phenomena, it seems that objective investigation is needed, and to "keep your feet on the ground" to work on the study of the external environment!</p>
<p>Literary critic Lanson said in his famous History of French Literature that Taine and Brunetière opened a new page in the history of criticism. The great development of modern natural science has also provided many methods to make literary criticism tend to be solid and certain. For past critics, praise and scolding are superfluous. Brunetière's argument is now dilapidated, and even Taine, who is called the most able to maintain an "objective attitude," has finally fallen into the quagmire of idealism in his application of methods? History is evolving, and some people have followed them to open a new page in the history of criticism. Only their down-to-earth interpretation of the influence of works on each other and their relationship with the changes in the objective environment has been unprecedented and can be regarded as the forerunner of modern criticism.</p>

<p>— Ye Cao</p>
<p>One evening, I was strolling along the wall of the village.</p>
<p>Suddenly, carried by the wind, came a kind of dismal cry from somewhere. The sound was long and low, as if something was covering the caller's throat, and yet he was still shouting in his struggle.</p>
<p>Terrifying, dreadful, the sound started again. Just like the first time, like the dying moan of a victim, desolate, heartbroken; I was so stirred that my eyes widened, my entire nervous system was enveloped, as if attracted by some force, I tried my best to find the origin of the sound.</p>
<p>I stopped outside the attached building wall of a landlord's house. I thought, here might be some new discovery. This is an indispensable building for landlords, located in the back row of the entire residence, not large in structure, but with quite a few rooms, usually used as a warehouse.</p>
<p>I leaned against a tree, looking in through the small window of the attached building. A gloomy lamp hung in the middle of the wall, opposite it was a terrible young farmer, he was hanging from the beam, his face pale, the whites of his eyes facing the ground:</p>
<p>"Tell me! Tell me! Hurry up and tell me!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he received several lashes on the young farmer's shoulders! The young farmer only glanced at him, not saying a word. The person holding the whip was our small village chief, a big guy with a face full of brutality: confirming that he was rich and powerful.</p>
<p>"Speak! I want you to say it yourself!"</p>
<p>Again, several lashes, the young farmer remained silent, quiet, he didn't even sigh. This aroused the small village chief's anger even more, he brandished the leather whip and lashed again, that ferocious face looked just like a beast!</p>
<p>"What do you want him to say? You..."</p>
<p>A woman knelt beside the small village chief, she wept, her voice trembling. She was the young farmer's wife, working as a hired woman in the small village chief's house. Originally, they rented the village chief's land, but due to the poor harvest that year, all the farming was undertaken by her husband.</p>
<p>"I mean..." the small village chief was a little embarrassed; women after all have magic, his tone immediately changed: "I mean, when can you pay back the grain you owe me?" The small village chief wanted to use these words to deceive the woman out, he felt unusually uneasy about the woman's sudden arrival, naturally, this was extremely inconvenient for the progress of his business.</p>
<p>"Big Master," the woman pleaded, "didn't I tell you, as soon as the wheat season comes next year, we will definitely pay it off! We don't eat much!"</p>
<p>"Go away, I will release him immediately—" the small village chief said to the woman with the tenderness he used to have for her, smiling, moving his eyes to the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>The woman watched with her own eyes as the small village chief released her husband, then slowly walked away. Her husband, powerless, slumped on the ground, his eyes tightly closed, his breathing very uneven.</p>
<p>The small village chief revealed a victorious expression, that posture was like a triumphant knight. He lit a cigarette, pacing back and forth in the dim light. Suddenly, he changed color, kicking the young farmer hard in the back:</p>
<p>"Tell me! Tell me! What did you say to people!"</p>
<p>"..." The young man did not answer.</p>
<p>"You speak! You ruined my reputation! I fuck your mother! You harmed me, I... tell me!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Speak, you poor wretch! What about me and your wife?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>The leather whip was waving again! Just as his second whip was about to fall, the young farmer somehow broke the rope and jumped up. He rushed over quickly, pointing his finger tightly at the small village chief's neck.</p>
<p>Hardly a sound could be heard, they were somersaulting and rolling on the ground, two pairs of eyes full of anger, hostile, with fire in them! That fire separated by a vast gulf! The dim light painted silhouettes of the struggle between these two pairs of fire on the wall.</p>
<p>"Ah..."</p>
<p>With such a cry, the small village chief fell down! I saw his blood flowing, his last throbbing; a terrifying atmosphere surrounded me, I fell from the tree to the ground again, I passed out!</p>
<p>The next day, people told me that the small village chief was stabbed to death by his maid, and the maid fled with her injured husband!</p>

<p>— Original by French Balzac, Translated by Wang Jiansheng</p>
<p>"What you said to your mother will make the problem even more serious. Let's talk about the main issue. "Do you still want to get a pardon?" "Yes." "Wait a minute," he said, "was there a cross marked on the gold coin too? The cross on the coin was marked by a sardine merchant when he gave us the money." Jia Aokuis finally understood, he cried, "We have said a lot," Pi said; "I will not mention anything about your past, but I don't want a Chaiboleimei family member to die in the Kelo Yixike market. Pray, we have to hurry up and paste it. Within a minute, a monk will come to hear your confession." His mother had already walked away, she could not bear to stay there and hear her son being convicted.</p>
<p>When she had already walked away, his uncle Chai Boleimei led a pastor from Piliaok to come; but Aokuis didn't have anything to say to him, he was a cunning person, he knew that his father's unwillingness to confess would not lead him to death. Chai Boleimei saw that Jia Aokuis was very stubborn, so he said, "Sir, thank you, please forgive me, but I want to give my son a big lesson, I ask you not to say anything more about this matter, as for you," he said to Jia Aokuis, "if you are not angry, this matter cannot be changed, I will solve this matter without hesitation. He sent him to bed. The child believed this, but he guessed that he could get his father's forgiveness, he slept, his father watched over him. When he saw his son falling asleep, he covered his mouth with linen, and tightly bound it with a canvas, finally tightening his hands and feet. He went crazy, he wept blood," as Chai Boleimei told the magistrate. You can imagine his mother kneeling in front of his father to beg for forgiveness. "He has been sentenced!" he said, "You have to help me put him in the boat," she refused this request, Chai Boleimei put him in the boat himself, forced him to the bottom of the boat, and tied a stone around his neck. Then he rowed out of the small bay—all the way out to the sea, to the rock where he is now sitting. At that time, the poor mother had asked her husband's brother to take her there, she shouted at the top of her voice: "Mercy!" But to no avail. It was a moonlit night, she saw her husband throw their son into the sea. The sea was calm, she only heard the sound of splashing water, and then nothing, no trace, no bubbles. No, the sea does not reveal any secrets, Chai Boleimei landed and comforted his wife's moans, but she was half dead, it was impossible for one brother to take her with him, they had no choice but to put her in the small boat that had just carried his son, rowing deep along the waterways of Kelo Yixike. Ah! This beautiful Boli tribe person left this world in less than a week. At the time of her death, she also asked her husband to burn that cursed small boat. He did as she asked. For the sake of his son, he had finished everything, he didn't know what else he needed. When he walked, he seemed unsteady on his feet like someone who was drunk, so he traveled for ten days, and when he came back, he sat where you saw him. He hasn't said a word since he sat there.</p>

<p>— Zhou Wen</p>
<p>"I wrote another poem yesterday, this..." he said.</p>
<p>"Oh?" The pale face's mouth corner held a smile, then he turned his face over again, half-opening his lips. Seeing the master's lips trembling, he thought he was about to recite, his head lowered towards the master's lips, unconsciously swaying on his neck with relish.</p>
<p>"No, no,... don't recite it." The master suddenly said to himself again. "Actually, after reading your poem 'Let's Touch This Cup!', mine should be burned..."</p>
<p>"Where, where." The pale face said repeatedly; so moved that his steps were a little unsteady. He looked at the master, then very sincerely stretched out a slender finger and gently patted the master's shoulder twice. "You are too modest, you are too humble! Actually, I have said long ago, among these poets, only you are the most promising. I, actually, am about to be what is called 'yesterday's flower'," he finished speaking, he was immediately very satisfied with the rhetoric of his words, neither raising others too high, nor demeaning himself too much, very in line with the doctrine of the mean. A smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>But the master was also moved, his face shining with oil, his cheekbones almost as red as his lips, the light in his eyes simply flashing. But he calmed down, immediately glancing at the pale face and saying:</p>
<p>"That is indeed your humility. The friends of our Lotus Poetry Society often say, now in China, who else is there besides you?"</p>
<p>The pale face now seemed to have drunk a large bowl of wine, completely intoxicated, his eyes simply burning, his unsteady feet, stepping on the terrazzo floor simply as if stepping on a velvet carpet. Stepping into a door frame, facing the dressing mirror standing against the wall twenty feet away, the white light of Kiyonga Ikkou shone brightly, clearly illuminating the shadow of himself walking ahead of the master with oily hair; the pale face's cheeks were red, his forehead flashing with oil, his long, slender frame wearing a light blue patterned silk shirt, his shoulders sloping, the hem of the blue silk shirt simply lightly fluttering in front of his legs. He deeply stared at this shadow that he felt was very suave, even he himself felt very lovable. But the mirror flashed and fell behind him, but he always felt attracted by it, as if it wanted to pull his head over; but he endured, endured; but finally turned his head back, but could only see the side of the upright mirror frame. It wasn't until the master stretched out his hand to him, and pointed to a long fat face and a round fat face in front of him, that he was surprised to take a closer look, and realized that he was in the living room.</p>
<p>"This is Boss Wang. This is Boss Liu." The master said.</p>
<p>The long fat face and the round fat face immediately clenched their fists and cupped their hands repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Hehe, I've heard of you for a long time!" The long fat face said.</p>
<p>"Hehe, I've heard of you for a long time! Actually, we met at Mr. Huang's place that time." The round fat face said.</p>
<p>The pale face was surprised, his palms moved at the sides of his legs, "Should I raise them up?" He quickly thought this, but finally raised them up, awkwardly clenching his fists and cupping his hands.</p>
<p>"Hehe," he said, the roots of his ears suddenly turning red, red to his cheeks.</p>
<p>The master glanced at the pale face, immediately remembering what the pale face had just said.</p>
<p>"Ah, damn! How did I bring him in front of businessmen..." So he immediately stretched out his hands towards the pale face's chest, making a gesture as if to hug him and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Huang and the others have a few poems here, how about you critique them for them, ah? Let's go over there?"</p>
<p>"Hehe," the pale face said with a smile, the moment he turned his face to the master, his eyes paused on the round fat face for a second, to see if he was flashing admiring eyes or opening his mouth in surprise.</p>
<p>The round fat face also stretched out his hands, his ten fat fingers straightened, his body flashed and he paced two steps away, his hand also embraced the empty chair and laughed:</p>
<p>"Ah, please sit on this one. Sit down. We are not strangers. Don't be polite."</p>
<p>"Ah, ah," the pale face nodded and said. "Don't be polite, don't be polite."</p>
<p>The master asked the pale face to walk towards the dressing mirror, when the two of them passed side by side through the middle of the room, next to the round table with a vase and a white cloth, the voices of the two fat faces rang behind them:</p>
<p>"Ah, ah, really, don't say it anymore, this year's business! That batch of goods I just mentioned, yesterday it was three taels and two, today it suddenly fell to three taels..."</p>

<p>— Long Zaitian</p>
<p>The setting sun swept a dazzling halo across the lawn of the vast forest, the shadows of the poplars were also lengthened on the ground; the privet and juniper trees on both sides of the sidewalk, in an orderly manner, interweaved four thick lines; the shadows of clumps of Scotch pine climbed like squirrels; the willow leaves were swaying messily, as if something was stirring under this huge flowered carpet,... the slightly red lotus buds just emerging from the water, in the shade of the mountain, were panting娇喘among countless green lotus leaves. The street lamps hidden in the shade of the maple and French parasol trees on both sides of the road also began to flicker with yellow light.</p>
<p>At this time, Kang Yu, Li Mi, and Ke Liangfu had, as usual, eaten dinner, and, as usual, instructed the tea servant to move the rattan chairs and tea table to the革坪, and also brewed a pot of white tea and a pot of green tea, to welcome the curtain of night, thrown down from the写窿 upper sky.</p>
<p>"Little Kang, have you eaten?" was a greeting with a Zhejiang accent from someone with the surname Shi; sometimes a middle-aged man with a big belly would come along, but not always. After sitting down, they would, as usual, talk about the objects that Ke Liangfu had not yet understood, in a burst of satisfied laughter, everyone would 打着九尾龟上学来的够作呕的苏白: 窝心得来!"</p>
<p>Then: Little Li would straighten his voice and hum a 犂 or Beijing opera tune.</p>
<p>In this way, the quiet dusk became lively. Only Ke Liangfu was呆呆的, because he was truly an outsider to the big drum. In this way, he raised his head alone, silently observing the surroundings of nature.</p>
<p>The crescent moon was already hanging in the mountain depression; her satellites also sparkled and followed her appearance; the fiery sunset had changed into dense clouds of green-gray; the mountains near and far were all dressed in evening clothes; fireflies glittered like shooting stars; the handle of the Great Dipper, the only thing he recognized, was also clearly outlined one by one. The green蛀 in the lotus pond, responding to the applause here, were constantly "阁哇, 阁哇"鼓噪...</p>
<p>Little Li's voice became louder and louder, and he began to sing the scolding of 流水板. However, Ke Liangfu still could not understand Beijing opera at all. And Tong and Kang seemed to have also shifted their interests, and were talking in low voices about their Mei Fen and Mei Ying, which forced Ke Liangfu to continue to quietly look at the sky.</p>
<p>The Milky Way's light band had clearly traversed the sky, Taurus was sparkling above his head, the hot velvet curtain was scattered like a fishing net. The treetops were dotted with rice-drawn black dots, the lines of the distant mountains were also blurred, the dots of electric fire in the distance were also shining through, and our group changed the topic again, and were laughing and talking in a tumultuous manner.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Further Discussion on the Responsibility of Children's Marriage <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>The other day, Xu Zhihui, the accountant of a wild game shop in Caishi Street, committed suicide due to being unable to repay his debts for his children's marriage. The reporter's thoughts led to the article "The Responsibility of Children's Marriage". As the idea was not exhausted, here are some more supplements.</p>
<p>In the future, the responsibility for children's marriage problems should naturally fall on the children themselves, as mentioned in the previous article. However, now is still a transitional era. Most children receive considerable education in schools or learn considerable professions in society. They have more time to contact the opposite sex, and free marriage is relatively easy. If daughters are bound by the old family ethics, some hire teachers to study at home, and some drop out of school for fear that their daughters will engage in indecent behavior outside. Even if they are studying at school, because the concept of old ethics is deeply imprinted in their minds, they still have the idea of "how can I see my mother with shame". Such daughters originally do not have the ability to be free, and only their fathers and brothers can introduce or make decisions. Only the current transitional era has such women. In the future, they will definitely be gradually assimilated.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are many abuses of free marriage. In the past, divorce cases were uncommon in autocratic marriages. Now, with free marriage, divorce cases are springing up like mushrooms after rain. It is an inevitable principle that easy marriage also leads to easy divorce. For fathers and brothers in charge, they usually have considerable guidance, and have the responsibility to agree or disagree at the time, but in fact, once a man and woman have reached the point of passionate love, the agreement or disagreement of their fathers and brothers is completely equal to a blank document.</p>
<p>Some say that since men and women have a high level of knowledge, they will naturally have considerable ability to make decisions and will not be fooled by others. This is not entirely true. For example, the other day the newspaper reported from Belgrade that Mania had eighty wives in five years. I think foreign women must have a higher level of knowledge than Chinese women, and among these eighty girls, there must be several who are very knowledgeable, that can be stated, however, they cannot avoid being deceived. This situation is evident, on the contrary, there may be women like Mania, so how can men not be deceived by them? Such drawbacks are inevitable in the belief in free marriage.</p>
<p>The above issues seem to be discussed too far, and have nothing to do with the responsibility of children's marriage, but they are extremely relevant. Because parents are not responsible for their children's marriage problems, then for all the unfortunate consequences that occur after marriage, parents also do not have to bear the responsibility. Then, children must also pay more attention to the issue of marriage themselves.</p>
<p>In short, now that social interactions have been made public and women have been liberated, there is originally no problem between men and women, but now people still regard the issue of social ethics as an extremely important problem in society, it is no different than fighting against the tide of the times.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Autumn Rain Serenade <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Qijun</p>
<p>The small boat glides gently on the river surface with a smiling crinkled face.</p>
<p>Outside the cabin—rain is falling softly.</p>
<p>It's autumn.</p>
<p>This should be said to be autumn rain.</p>
<p>After spending the season of autumn rain, everything will return to the silence of winter.</p>
<p>People, hiding in that narrow, cramped cabin, are in a depressed mood. In their hearts, they unconsciously feel a touch of dim melancholy. Like the misty autumn rain, giving the nearby forests, the continuous hills, and the ancient city walls, a layer of hazy gray.</p>
<p>From what time did I understand the loveliness of melancholy, I can't remember clearly. However, as soon as autumn arrives, that suffocating depression pressed on my heart comes along with the autumn wind. On the one hand, I feel it is lovely, on the other hand, I feel a kind of disappointment and resentment.</p>
<p>"In summer, I had dreams every night. Now that summer is over, those dreams have disappeared with the last roses of summer.</p>
<p>"Friend, you should know, how I regret the passing of my youth.</p>
<p>"Today, it is even more gloomy.</p>
<p>"—Why are you so depressed?</p>
<p>"I can't answer your question; don't you understand me?</p>
<p>"So, thinking of myself, tonight, I will be sleepless because of this."</p>
<p>Thinking of the words written in my friend's notebook, I can only stare blankly, with a melancholy wry smile. There is a special feeling between us; so I scooped out the passion hidden deep in my heart.</p>
<p>But, who can understand themselves better than themselves!</p>
<p>In the summer, I felt hatred, annoyance, resentment, and all kinds of displeasure everywhere. I thought that when autumn came, the weather would be cool, and the heart crouched in depression could spend some happy days in the high and clear autumn.</p>
<p>But, after all, I was disappointed.</p>
<p>I will never find it strange that disappointment closely follows the advent of hope. Expectation and bubbles are, in my eyes, as ordinary as flowers blooming and falling. Since I became sensible, a long string of days has passed in that disappointed mood, deceiving myself with hope, spending spring, and then spending autumn.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in the quiet of the night, gazing at the clean and beautiful sky like dark blue velvet, the moon walks through the clouds. In my heart, I will think: if I really keep walking like this, when will it end? —This is a question that cannot be answered.</p>
<p>The desolation of dusk, the haziness of autumn rain, the sky is getting darker.</p>
<p>Tonight, it is a sky where you can't see the moon again. —I thought. My heart felt like a cold wind had blown?…</p>
<p>Outside the cabin—rain is falling softly.</p>
<p>It's autumn.</p>

<p>— Jin Guang</p>
<p>A gust of evening wind thickened the desolation of autumn, the frightening sound of falling leaves, stirring everyone's shivering hearts; the children were all nestled tightly in their mothers' arms, trembling silently; the elderly's weak bodies were also leaning on the shoulders of the strong, only waves of sick moans, piercing the hearts of their companions. A few days of traveling at night had trained them to be very calm, there was no noise, no crying in fear, and even less resentment, only people close to people, hearts connected to hearts, silently and solemnly, in the terrifying night forest, making a flight without a home.</p>
<p>Although the road was unfamiliar, it still extended endlessly under their feet. —People are like a flock of crows without a home.</p>
<p>It was a pitch-black团; no moonlight, no firelight, not a single light; people were walking in the dark hell, except for being able to see half of their own body, they couldn't see anything else, except for being able to hear their own hurried breathing, they could only hear the breathing of others, many people couldn't hold on. In their hearts, they all called out 'Stop! Stop, it's the same as not being able to live!' But they were unwilling to say it out loud; after all, they thought that behind them were the swallowing flood, and the terrible claws of the demons in the dark, so they struggled again and followed the crowd, their numb legs didn't seem to feel anything anymore.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the dusk of the second day that they rushed to an ancient town; quiet, desolate, telling them that they were also a group of people caught in hunger, cold, and desolation.</p>
<p>Sparse smoke from the cooking fires, stirring a string of hungry eyes, they couldn't help but shake their empty bellies, swallowing a mouthful of dust-covered saliva.</p>
<p>But the people in that village had long known their origins from their clothing covered in dust; they had detected their situation from the faces with shadows; without waiting for them to speak, they said to them:</p>
<p>'The year is not good, we don't have the ability to keep you in town.'</p>
<p>A sigh, the dusk became even more bleak; step by step, they still rushed into the lurking darkness; they passed another foreign land!</p>
<p>Mountain after mountain, river after river, one village after another, passed under their tired feet; they made a flight without a home. —They were a group of homeless refugees.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Haziness <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>I didn't look at the clock when I stumbled out of the room. Judging from the chatter of the sparrows on the yellow leaves, it felt quite early. The milky white sky was inlaid with a few patches of pale gray clouds. The weather was cool. A gust of wind brought a shower of rain, and the rain stopped when the wind passed. I donned my black rain cape, put the cigarette holder in my mouth, and was led by a yellow dragonfly with black spots, through the bamboo forest, and then through the small path inlaid with tile shards in patterns between the rows of willow trees. Thin moss grew sparsely on the path. Although very subtle, it was full of vitality, unlike the bamboo leaves, maple leaves, and willow branches, which couldn't withstand the pressure of the rain and the blowing of the wind, and drooped low, displaying a tired posture.</p>
<p>My usual spot for sitting is always by the lake, idly gazing at the blue waves and green mountains...</p>
<p>However, today's scenery is different again. After the rain, the green mountains are gone, the blue waves are gone, and the brown sails drifting in the distance are gone. From the clumps of reeds growing on the lake surface, there is only a vast expanse of hazy territory. If a tourist who has never been here before, he would definitely think that there is a vast and promising future in the haze, or that there is a verdant plain over there, and would never expect that high mountains, steep cliffs, strange rocks, deep caves, and thorns full of sharp spines are hidden in the misty haze ahead. The boatmen do not like this hazy lake surface. They are afraid of steering the boat in the wrong direction and accidentally hitting the reefs hidden in the water, the remnants of the mountains. I watched the few masts carefully approaching the lake beach and flowing past, without any sound. The lake water was calm and gleaming with white light, like solidified jelly, fully revealing the loneliness of life.</p>
<p>I sat on a damp stone and gently blew out a puff of smoke. From the smoke rings that suddenly grew larger and then burst, a dark tide of thought quietly arose:</p>
<p>"My own life is often obscured by haziness, preventing me from recognizing the truth, the world, and sin. I cannot reflect the meaning of existence and the center of thought, and yet I timidly hold a weak heart, walking step by step on the edge of the journey of life. I am afraid of accidentally entering the pit of sin, afraid of touching the insidious reefs, and also afraid of going in the wrong direction on the road of life. 'Caution' is often ridiculed as 'cowardice,' but occasionally being a little bolder will be condemned by that kind of 'morality,' and then the present becomes even more hazy. Should I simply close my eyes and live in confusion, letting precious time flow by like water in confusion?"...</p>
<p>I remember living in the city, morning, evening, or rainy days, walking onto the rooftop terrace and looking around, the red rooftops, gray high-rise buildings, black iron chimneys, and red lighthouses, the crisscrossing electric wires... vaguely hidden in the smoke and turned into a hazy scene; intense appetites, sinister conspiracies, licentiousness, madness, sin: everything was obscured, so it was often easy to think of a fairyland and feel the breadth and joy of the realm of life. However, this is still a smokescreen, and behind the smokescreen are heavy bombs! Therefore, I cannot look at the haze with satisfaction, like a poet or painter.</p>
<p>The guy who was on duty watching the night in the garden passed by with heavy steps. A spark of a just discarded cigarette butt was extinguished. A black ant crawled over the flattened cigarette butt. I was happy for this ant, but the weather was still so gloomy, and the lake surface was still so hazy. I couldn't help but feel a dark sorrow for the situation before me. The blue waves and green mountains I longed for?…</p>

<p>Opening "Advising Not to Eat Opium"</p>
<p>Lying lazily on the couch and enjoying oneself.</p>
<p>Why ever leave the house in all seasons?</p>
<p>The light of a lamp is hard to compare to a bean.</p>
<p>But it is more enchanting than electric light.</p>
<p>Three or five friends lying together.</p>
<p>Nothing more than spitting out mist and swallowing clouds.</p>
<p>A handgun is not as good as an opium pipe.</p>
<p>Happiness is found only in opium.</p>
<p>Precious money is used wrongly.</p>
<p>Giving up one's rights to others.</p>
<p>I advise you all to listen carefully.</p>
<p>Only opium addiction harms one's entire life.</p>
<p>It can make a father and son become enemies.</p>
<p>It can make a husband and wife lack affection.</p>
<p>It can make brothers no longer righteous.</p>
<p>It can make relatives and friends look down on you.</p>
<p>It can make it impossible to protect a thousand-year foundation.</p>
<p>It can make one's family and business decline and be invaded by others.</p>
<p>All day long, the red sun rises and one goes into a dream.</p>
<p>One is energetic in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Turning day and night upside down.</p>
<p>Spending time unknowingly.</p>
<p>A seven-foot man should have ambition.</p>
<p>How can one seek pleasure and neglect youth?</p>
<p>Time is like water and cannot be regained.</p>
<p>One must be famous.</p>
<p>I hope my compatriots quickly quit opium.</p>
<p>Everyone will be energetic.</p>
<p>Please forgive me, Ruiting, for not being bold.</p>
<p>But daring to write a worldly admonition.</p>
<p>You must forgive me for my sincerity.</p>

<p>The Drama Club, which will soon perform in a certain grand theater, has been quite busy recently. Among the originally scheduled scripts, "Until Tomorrow" was not approved, so it has now been changed to "Blind in One Eye." They are rehearsing hard every day to prepare for the performance. It is heard that the female lead is Miss Li Lanying from Beiping, nicknamed "Little Doctor," and the male leads are still Ba Jin from "Until Tomorrow" and Tu Xiejun from "Grocery Store." The director, Tu Qifei, is so busy every day that he is sweating profusely and hardly has time to eat. Such hard work will certainly not lead to failure.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Interesting Anecdotes on the Location Shoot of "Triumphant Song" <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Meiyun was so frightened that she yelled "pig"! Guan Pangzi sang "Wang Baochuan" loudly.</p>
<p>Bu Wancang directed the sound film "Triumphant Song." The crew set off for Hangzhou Zhuji the day before yesterday for location shooting. Yesterday, we received a letter from Chen Linshu, the stage director, reporting the situation along the way, which was quite humorous. I have recorded it to make you laugh.</p>
<p>Our "Triumphant Song" location crew took the 9:30 AM express train from Shanghai Fanxue Ferry. Arriving in Hangzhou at 3:30 PM, they chartered five cars and drove to the Jiangbian in Nanxing Bridge, and then chartered a small steamer directly to Zhuji. They arrived at the residence of Mr. Pan, a friend of Mr. Bu, at 11:30 PM. The working location is there. Here is a small report on the journey.</p>
<p>The day of departure was the day when Nie Er's memorial service was held in Shanghai Jincheng. We were unable to attend because of work, which was of course very unsettling. However, on the ship, Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Jiang Xiu, Liu Li, Jin Yi, Ge Aina, etc., in order to express their condolences to the spirit of this progressive composer, sang "Escape Song" composed by Nie Er. At this time, they passed the small town of Linpu and suddenly saw electric lights everywhere. We were very surprised and asked the boatman, who told us that the Ullambana Festival was being held to super-transcend the souls.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Bu spoke, asking everyone to be quiet for one minute to express condolences. Afterwards, because the tide was high and almost level with the bridge, the boat could not pass, so it was parked on the shore. Everyone stretched their necks and looked into the distance, seeing only black shadows, and the rustling of grass and trees made people shiver. At this point, Yuan Meiyun was the first to flee into the cabin, and the rest followed suit. Then, the sound of "wow woo" came from the shore. Amnia said that the red man was coming, frightening Yuan Meiyun to yell "pig!"</p>
<p>Inside the cabin, bored, Qin Tong imitated Yuan Meiyun's singing of "Picking Lotus Song" in "Triumphant Song." Zhang Yide sang a Hua Dan role, making people's muscles twitch. Qin Tong had a very good appetite, unconsciously so. Guan Hongda and Zhao Tushan sang "Joining the Army," Guan played Wang Baochuan, and Zhao played Xue Pinggui. The singing was done with acting, which was much more humorous than listening to "Freedom Dance." Everyone burst out laughing. Then, Wu Weiyun and Gu Zongyi sang "Ma Lang Dang" and "Little Widow" in a completely Suzhou accent, making people laugh to tears.</p>
<p>Today (17th), Bu and Wu are looking for location scenes in the morning, filming in the afternoon, and there are many planes at night. The mosquito nets are ineffective, and it is impossible to sleep well. It is probably because Hangzhou has an aviation school.</p>
<p>This departure has a crew of 58 people, lasting about a month. It is possible to return soon. There are more than 100 pieces of luggage and ten water pumps, belts, etc., and the entire set of costumes for "Fishing Family," the scene is grand to the extreme.</p>
<p>The goods in my belly are almost gone, I will report again tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Japanese Temple Architecture (4) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Ito Chuta (Author) Zhang Guangzheng (Translator)</p>
<p>The Architecture of Tsukiji Hongwanji Temple</p>
<p>Related to the above, I would like to talk about the recently renovated Tsukiji Hongwanji Temple. This building was actually designed by me under the commission of the temple, and I am now explaining it here again, which is a bit inappropriate. I ask for your indulgence. At first, I made two designs according to the wishes of the temple, one purely Japanese style and one Indian style. After careful deliberation by the temple authorities, the Indian style was selected. Based on the reasons mentioned above and the requirements of the Oka plan, I also felt that the Indian style was better. Here, I am doing my best to achieve it. Because this is a new attempt with no precedent, it is of course expected to become a major issue in the architectural world. Sure enough, voices of praise and criticism rose from all sides, for which I am grateful. However, there are many misunderstandings among them, and I feel it is necessary to explain them.</p>
<p>Some people say that the building is a modern and gorgeous building; others criticize it as being quite similar to the Nicholas Church; others feel that there is no such style in the Saracenio and Indian styles; and a certain magazine mocks the designer for not knowing the difference between the Saracenio and Indian styles. Here, I will not go into detail one by one, but only think of a simple word. First, is the relationship with Nicholas Church: The architecture of Nicholas Church is called "Russian Eastern Romanesque." The Eastern Romanesque style contains a strong oriental color. This oriental color is mainly Persian, and it can be traced back to India even further. That is to say, the style of Nicholas Church naturally has an Indian style flavor hidden in its bones. Therefore, it is not bad eyesight to see the two as resembling each other.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is not without reason to mistake the Hongwanji Temple as a Saracenio building. Originally, the Saracenio building originated in the Arab region. Later, it was greatly influenced by the prosperity of Islam and Eastern architecture such as Eastern Rome and Persia before it reached its peak. However, Mr. Hauer, an authority on the study of Indian art history, said that Saracenio architecture was greatly influenced by Indian architecture. In short, there is a connection between Saracenio architecture and ancient Indian architecture. Therefore, modern Saracenio architecture and Indian architecture are often confused and difficult to distinguish. The architecture of Hongwanji Temple is based on the ancient Indian style, but if you carefully examine its many modern handcrafts, it is easy to mistake it for a Saracenio style, which is a fact.</p>
<p>Secondly, fundamentally speaking, there are many people who criticize that the Hongwanji Temple's choice of Indian style was a bad choice, which is due to different opinions. As mentioned earlier, tracing back to the roots of Buddhism and basing it on the Indian style is theoretically, materially, structurally, and in terms of the luxurious nature, the relationship of labor costs, all of which are very appropriate. However, I am not saying that it is appropriate for all sects and various Buddhist buildings across Japan to adopt the Indian style. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e196">From Architectural Art to the Temples of Greece (VII) <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Zongwen</p>
<p>——The Most Glorious Page in the History of World Architecture——</p>
<p>(IV) Sculpture and Color of Greek Temples</p>
<p>The fame of Greek architectural art in the world is also due to the beauty of the sculptures on its buildings. Originally, Greek sculpture art was also a glorious and splendid page in the history of world art, occupying an extremely important position. When the Greeks designed a building, the architect and the sculptor cooperated with each other, so the products presented a spirit of harmony, and no inferior works appeared. In addition, most of the building materials were made of extremely beautiful and pleasing stone blocks, such as marble, and the Greek sculptors used their skilled techniques to create them carefully; no wonder their temples were worshipped by the world!</p>
<p>On Greek temples, the most important places for sculpture are the Pediment, Metope, and Freize; the stories of the sculptures mostly tell the life stories of the gods enshrined in the temple, or the battles between the race and the gods; the most common and most sculpted story is the battle between the half-man, half-horse animal Centaurus and the Lapitha tribe. Other things varied depending on the time and place, but the sculpting techniques were always very sophisticated. At that time, the most famous Greek sculptors were Phidias and Scopas. The styles of the two were unique, and the latter's works were the most fashionable and representative of the national character at the time. The former's representative work is the Parthenon Temple, and the latter's representative work is the Ionic Temple; the former temple is a famous building in the history of world architecture, while the latter is one of the seven wonders of the world. The greatness of the two buildings is enough to represent the superb skills of these two sculptors. It is also sufficient to represent the highest point of Greek art at that time. The appearance of these two sculptors added a layer of magic to the magnificent temples at the time.</p>
<p>Whether a building is harmonious or not is closely related to the beauty of the building. The so-called "harmony" has two aspects: first, the harmony of form, and second, the harmony of color. The former has been mentioned earlier, and the latter is what we are going to talk about now.</p>
<p>Greek temples also paid great attention to the harmony of colors; because they often carved landscapes and figures on fleshy marble such as Penteric and Parian marble, and because the colors of the materials were beautiful and elegant, their works also presented a spirit of harmony. Also, we know that people without cultural education always like to apply deep, eye-catching, and extremely strong colors to buildings, such as red, blue, etc. Many temples in ancient times were in this situation; however, although Greek temples were influenced by legacy and customs, they did make a lot of progress in terms of color. They mostly painted the important parts of the color, such as the deep parts that cannot be seen from a distance, with light colors on them; in this way, the inherent sculptural beauty would not be destroyed. In short, they wrote with "beauty" as the only condition. Because of the beauty of their colors and the rarity of their materials, no wonder their temples were so amazing!</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, we can know that Greek temples are indeed great, delicate, and rare, and they are indeed the most brilliant page in the history of world architectural art! The greatness of its architectural art in terms of skills is enough to give people a different impression; it is an unforgettable page of historical relics for everyone engaged in the architectural business, in our minds. However, the most regrettable thing is that due to the long years and the changes in historical events, the most famous temples in history have now been destroyed and no longer exist! Even if there are any, they are only fragments of sculptures from the temples that are still preserved in the British Museum, just for people to commemorate and pay their respects! However, isn't everything in the world like this?! (The End)</p>

<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Zinc</p>
<p>Section 1 Overview of Zinc</p>
<p>Because zinc is very active when it is in a metallic state, there are no individual mineral seedlings. It is usually chemically transformed into zinc sulfide and buried. Therefore, all zinc mines are sulfides.</p>
<p>Section 2 Smelting of Zinc</p>
<p>The smelting of zinc is also divided into two methods: retort method and electrolytic method.</p>
<p>(1) Retort Method—Use a retort made of white porcelain sand. Place coal powder and fine zinc ore powder inside the retort. The usual proportion is 40% to 75% of coal powder, and the coal powder is best made of white coal and other anthracite. After mixing, heat it together outside the retort. Heating and burning coal, coal gas or other fuels are all acceptable. Connected to the retort is a ceramic air cooler and a cast iron condensing box. When zinc is distilled and gasified from the retort, it can be condensed into a liquid through this box, and it can be taken out from the bottom of the box.</p>
<p>(2) Electrolytic Method! First, roast the mineral seedlings, refine them once, and add sulfuric acid to release some of the liquid, which is converted into sulfur dioxide and dissipated, and the zinc electrons are reduced from the zinc sulfate and attached to the iron plate. Moreover, if sulfur and iron ore are mixed, magnets can be used to separate this substance into two parts. The part containing vaporized zinc can be put into sulfuric acid for further treatment to obtain a zinc sulfate solution. This acidic solution is then mixed with the part that does not contain vaporized zinc to neutralize it. Through this neutralizing chemical change, the iron is converted into iron hydroxide and automatically precipitates. At the same time, impurities such as arsenic, silicon, and antimony sand can also sink together. Then, the pure zinc is completely attached to the electrode plate, and it can be taken out.</p>
<p>Section 3 Properties and Applications of Zinc</p>
<p>Zinc is grayish-white, is not susceptible to erosion by air and moisture, is very conductive, and is ductile, but its resistance is not strong. The maximum resistance of cast zinc is only 9,000 pounds per square inch, and if it is rolled and cut, it is only 24,000 pounds per square inch, and the elastic limit is only 5,000 pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>As for the uses of zinc, it can also be made into alloys in the construction industry and can be coated on the surface of iron sheets to make galvanized iron sheets, which are used to cover roofs. (End of Chapter 8)</p>

<p>— Buren</p>
<p>However, there was also a "Gothic Revival." People like Horace Walpole and Beckford were indeed very enthusiastic, but they were not very knowledgeable; they built strange houses for themselves. Although the spires and roof dust were mostly made of slats and plaster, and wooden window decorations were often simulated with paint to imitate stone, in their expectations, the appearance of these houses was in line with the correct medieval style. Of course, in these buildings, there are clumsy small windows, fragile and bizarre houses, and cold stone corridors, but such romantic houses gradually became popular. Even today, the British have not yet recovered from this epidemic; just look at the houses of the British today, which still cannot be separated from decorations such as small spires.</p>
<p>Thus, at the same time, even in the same place, you will find that one house belongs to the late classical style, another belongs to the fake Gothic style, and perhaps a third is a mixture of the two. This is the "Muddle Ages" of architecture. Now, we are still in this period, but at the same time we are working hard to get out of this period.</p>
<p>About fifty years ago, most people were surrounded by this "confusion," lazily imitating this or that, without intending to design buildings that were needed for actual life—this is proper architecture.</p>
<p>Later, Philip Webb and his successor Norman Shaw thought that it seemed like a very smart way to return to the benchmark that British architecture had reached before these different "revivals" broke the tradition. That is the architecture of the mid-eighteenth century, namely Georgian architecture. This architectural style gradually became popular, so the best British architecture in the past fifty years has belonged to this revived British classical style and its new variations. Now, there are many excellent architects, such as Sir Edwin Lutyens, who do not hesitate to solve new problems in their own way, although most of them base their new plans on the fashion of the eighteenth century.
