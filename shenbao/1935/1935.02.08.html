<p>上海各華商銀行。認復興農村爲當前急務。故有貸欵銀團之組織。其貸欵辦法何如。雖未具體商定。而放欵農村之原則。已爲金融界所贊同。並視此爲救濟農村有效方法之一。可謂認題已眞。但看將來登揮如何耳。</p>
<p>我國城市之發達。最初以政治爲中心。次乃推及於商業。以往如舊都北京與各省省城。莫不如此。迄乎海禁開通。沿海各口岸。與海外交通日繁。商業基礎漸固。第因産業機構未能奠定。因之一切難以發展。當世界經濟恐慌發生之初期。我國爲用銀國家。輸入固受影響。輸出則有利益。惜彼時過於漠視。未及未雨綢繆以致恐慌襲來。竞至無從防禦。蓋我國産業機構。旣不健全。輕工業出品。匪特不能向海外推消。且不能把握國内市塲。終至工商交困。卽此僅有之都市繁榮。亦幾不克維持矣。</p>
<p>我國商業之直接向國外輸出入者。向居少數。對於海外需要與供給關係。多不甚明瞭。故每易受外人操縱。其輸出原料。固多仰給於農村。輸入貨品。亦以農村爲主。大都市及中等城市之所消費者。今猶視農村經濟情形爲轉移。最近二年來。豐收成災。繼以旱魃農業生機幾絶。加以九一八及一二八兩次事變。旣消失足供挹注之華北實力。復使繁華之上海遭受重大打撃。年年驚人之輸入超過。依然繼續不已。民力愈見疲敝。市面不景氣更益深刻。無形輸人。又因華僑之　微而减少。城市工商與農業。同受其病。今日而欲謀所以更生。不得不有待於農村元氣之恢復也。</p>
<p>農業生産之疲敝。由來巳久我國農村自給自足之環境。數十年來巳經打破。甚至米　亦不敷用。則農業本身之無力支持彰彰明　即以副業之收入論。如江浙之絲茶。長江上游之桐油蔗糖華北之羊毛及棉花等。亦皆爲農業收入之大宗。頃自各國力求自給而後。絲茶首現頽敗。其餘羊毛棉花等各種物産。亦罕能續有進步。長此以往農村誠將不免於破産銀行界在此時機。向農村投資。洵屬得當。一則可以消除城市過剩之遊資再則潤澤農村。卽所以間接助長城市。惟對農村放欵。有須特别注意者。</p>
<p>第一。利率宜低。現時農民困苦。不堪重負。銀行放欵。須首計自身安全。設使利率過高。致農業生産不敷支消。則危險殊多。非特今銀行本身不利。卽對農業復興。亦失原旨。</p>
<p>第二。期限宜稍長久。夫農業生産轉換時間。大抵在長江流域。至少半年。在黄河流域各省。且須九個月以至一年故應就農村實地情况。斟酌收放時間。以期收互利之效。</p>
<p>第三提倡副業。絲茶等事業專依海外消塲回復非易。今後宜就各地方情形。與一般消費力之所及從事提倡則出品可暢消農業亦得實惠貸欵之收回。更不成問題。</p>

<p>莫斯科蘇維埃聯邦共和國大會、今日一致通過大改革案、此爲俄國憲法大改革之先聲、人民委員會主席莫洛托夫在投票後對衆發言、謂巴力門制度之各種優點、今後將採入於蘇維埃制度中、今階級制度旣已廢除、秘密投票自可採行、將來地方蘇維埃可直接選舉代表加入全聯大會、並加入中央執行委員會、而農工皆有同樣參政權、渠希望普遍選舉之目的、不久可達到云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科蘇聯人民委員會主席莫洛托夫今日向蘇維埃代表大會建議、蘇聯憲法若干部份須予變更、大會代表經短時間之辯論後、（科西奥爾及郭洛台德亦參加辯論）一致通過下述决議、「莫洛托夫將聯共中央委員會二月常會關於蘇聯憲法須有若干變動之决議報告後、第七届蘇維埃代表大會卽加以討論、結果認共黨中央委員會之提案爲完全正確與合時、並指令如下、</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯憲法應修改如下、（甲）爲求選舉制度之更須民主化、須將前此不完全平等的分級的及記名投票選舉、改成平等的直接及無記名投票選舉、（乙）憲法之社會經濟基礎、應按照目前蘇聯階級關係（新的社會主義工業之創立「富農之消滅·集體耕作制之澈底勝利·以及承認社會主義財産爲蘇維埃社會之基礎等等）作更精確之規定、</p>

<p>莫斯科莫洛托夫報告憲法修改問題云、「共黨中央委員會敬向蘇維埃代表大會提出蘇聯憲法之若干修改問題、中央委員會之提出此項問題、乃由斯太林之建議、（衆鼓掌）此項問題之提出乃由下述原因、第一、自一九一八年列寗奠定蘇聯憲法之基礎以後、蘇聯階級力量之關係已大有變化、而尤以社會主義財産之原則在城鄕獲得勝利以後爲然、第二、吾人此時巳能澈底實行蘇維埃民主主義、而令選舉制度作相應之修改、蘇聯憲法成於一九二三年、其時草憲委員會乃由斯太林氏主持、唯吾國今日情勢、若其社會經濟結構、以及勞動大衆在文化及政治上之發展、全不能與一九二三年時相比、」（中略）「黨中央委會今向大會提出下列問題、以爲蘇維埃制度更進一步民主化之切要辦法、第一、取銷目下間接選舉法、實行各蘇維埃機關（自村鎭蘇維埃至蘇聯中央報行委員會）之直接選舉法、蓋直接選舉能提高蘇維埃機關之威望、加强彼等與勞動大衆之關聯、最高蘇維埃機關將升至更高水凖、目前資本主義國家放棄直接選舉者日衆、彼等更用委任官吏之辦法、代替選舉、而蘇聯則以直接選舉代替間接選舉、吾人規定投票者對其所選代表得有自任何機關中撤回之權、同時勞動者非黨組織與團體得預選候補人、如是則吾蘇維埃制度在蘇維埃民主政治之發展途上、將更進一步矣、</p>
<p>莫洛托夫復論採用平等選舉云、「蘇聯憲法規定、工人在選舉上得較農民有更多之特權、此種辦法之採用、乃以當時一般農民猶爲小所有者、同時鄉區富農勢力至大、自蘇聯憲法草訂後、情形巳有劇變、農民大衆已捐棄其零細私人耕作、加入集體農塲、從事新的社會主義生活之建設、農民大衆巳隨工人之後、加入社會主義建設者之隊伍、工人與農民間之差異、其消滅之路已經擴淸、其選舉權之差别當首先取消、吾人廢除不完全平等之選舉、採取一切勞動大衆之平等選舉、必令工人與農民之團結、更爲緊密與强固、故蘇維埃國家之力量亦必日强、而吾走向無階級存在之社會之路上、亦必有更多之成功也、</p>
<p>「至於記名投票之改爲無記名投票、對於蘇聯政府機關與廣大勞動羣衆之聯繋、乃係嚴重之測騐、彼所表示者爲蘇維埃政府之力量之來源、乃在大衆參加整個國家行政之加强與積極、大衆對於整個國家機關（無論上下）控制之增强、蘇維埃國家在其繼續鞏固蘇維埃制度之際、今日已能以蘇維埃制度爲基礎、實現普遍直接平等及無記名選舉之一切優點、蘇維埃在過去與今日、均爲吾國制度之基礎、唯議會制度之優點、卽以直接平等與秘密之方法、由全體勞動者參加（蘇聯憲法卽要求如此）選舉國家行政機關之代表一舉、須在今日之蘇聯始能充分實現也、</p>

<p>轉載搭客山東輪亦到</p>
<p>船員詳述盜刧時情形</p>
<p>英商太古公司北洋班通州輪、上月二十八日、由滬赴烟津、被海盜混入船内、駛出吳淞口外卽遭騎刧、該輪巳於昨晨六時五十分進口、八時後並碼頭、本館記者、昨到船訪詢各船員、茲將此事經過分述如下、</p>
<h3 id="c130">兩輪同到 <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>通州輪於昨晨進口時、即在吳淞口抛錨、由太古大班賚姆、通告海關水巡捕房·及市公安局水警·到輪、加以搜檢、歷半小時之久、方始竣事、船到上海、停泊法租界碼頭、巳八時半、法捕房探警早經密布、禁止閑雜人登輪、而轉載該輪客人山東輪、亦於昨晨抵吳淞、亦受同樣搜檢、且較通州輪更嚴、經過三小時之久、將各旅客一一抄查、結果有旅客十餘人、爲水公安隊帶去、須加研訊、方得放出、及至十一時、始克駛抵碼頭、復加二次檢查、嚴密爲向所罕有、</p>
<h3 id="c131">擬刦新鈔 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>大鵬灣海盜、於本年一月初、即潛來上海、各輪公司、事先得香港警務當局密告、故於商輪出口、檢查至嚴、日久未有發見、不免淡然處之、抑知各海盜在滬剌探各輪進行頗密、上月二十八日、太古通州輪赴津、本埠中國銀行、有新印一元五元十元鈔幣一批、計二十五萬元、共裝五箱、運往天津、以供華北行使、此項新鈔票、圖案爲耕牛耘田、其地名號碼等、雖巳編列、但簽名印鑑、則尙未加蓋、原擬俟到津後、再行加印、以昭愼重、不料竟爲匪盜所悉、企圖刦取、</p>
<h3 id="c132">密運槍械 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>上月通州輪由滬出口時、雖經嚴加檢查、但迄未搜出各匪槍械、經記者向船員詳加探詢、始知通州輪自二十六日到滬、抛停碼頭三天、此三日中、上下旅客甚夥、海盜槍械、大約於此三日中、乘人多嘈雜時、秘密運上船中、藏匿人所不見之處、故二十八日冒充搭客上輪、自不能發見其槍械也、海盜共十一名、中有領袖一人、年三十餘、面目黝黑、上船後、散居統艙中、匪盜自稱有二十四名、此係誇大之詞、該輪於二十八日上午十時開船、當日午後六時、行至佘山洋面、匪即動乎行刦、</p>
<h3 id="c133">控制全船 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>是時船内正開晚餐、匪首即乘機、命盜黨從統艙内躍出、各携手槍匣子砲、由兩邊扶梯、直上台甲、時七十餘名西人餘名西人孩童、正在艙面遊玩、白俄護航警見狀、急欲開槍拒敵、乃以匪雜羣孩内、恐致誤傷、故舉槍而未發、匪首即先發制人、將俄警開槍撃斃、又將二管輪打倒、始直上駕駛台、將無綫電拆去、並將船主看管、約兩小時中、該輪全船、完全爲海盜所控制、由是改易航道、而向南華開去、</p>
<h3 id="c134">盜大失望 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>海盜目的、在二十五萬元新紙幣、故占領全船後、即知照在輪各船員、無事不可出艙、有事可來傳喚、旋命船員、迅將銀倉開啓、交出鈔幣、船員被逼、祇得將五箱鈔票交出、開示之下、見未簽印、知不能用、匪首大爲懊喪、</p>
<h3 id="c135">行刧三天 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>匪首旋對船員與旅客言、余等希望、不刦船員搭客、至是巳完全失敗、須知余等由香港來滬、共用去四千餘元、今一無所獲、豈可空手而回、立命各船員將所有現欵獻出、並搜刦全部旅客財物、但匪首知照各盜、對於婦女孩子、不可强刦、總計自二十九日晨起、開始搜刦、經三夜兩天之久始止、匪據大餐室、爲司令台、取得贓物、均放在大餐室中、</p>
<h3 id="c136">航警殉職 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>航警鐵化拿天、ＪＴihornoff係白俄籍、當塲爲匪撃中頭腦而斃、倒在台甲上、二管輪麥克唐納、ＫＭacdonald在臥室内取手槍、出、而抵抗、亦爲匪首開槍撃傷、彈中肩窩、船上共有手槍長槍十二桿、匣子砲五枝、子彈數百粒、均爲航警五名及高級船員六人、用以自衛、乃均爲海盜繳去、至第二日晨、撃斃俄警屍體、爲盜抛棄海中、海盜因二管輪反抗、必欲殺害、後經大副一再向匪首懇商、始得保全生命、</p>
<h3 id="c137">搜刦現欵 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>盜匪十一人當行刦時、均將身上衣服脱去、單衣跣足、匪首在刦掠前、曾言鈔票不能用、請你們凑凑數目吧、先將乘客身畔搜索、次至買辦間帳房内將客票洋刦去、大買辦王錦濤未上船、二買辦陳慶豪在輪、祗得聽其搜刦、統艙内有一毛姓女客、帶兩小孩、身上祇有洋五元匪言你川資太少、不敷到天津之用、命匪勿刦、轉由匪首給予洋十元、又有一老嫗、身穿破衣、身上祇有兩元、匪亦給予五元、又九號艙内兩妓女、詢悉係初次出外賣淫、戒各匪勿刦、至於西人兒童、經敎師磋商、自動凑出洋三四百元、亦未搜刦、統搜刦結果、共得洋二千餘元、</p>
<h3 id="c138">兩客倖運 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>船内華人搭客、共有一百餘人、此次匪徒行刦、與歷次洗刦不同、匪首志在鈔票、不重視旅客船員錢財、故搜刦時、不准匪衆野蠁、有一盜搜一船員、較爲苛虐、爲匪首所見、即舉拳將該匪打倒、因之船員與旅客中、保全金錢不少、旅客中有兩人携帶支票及銀行存摺現欵等、共計二十萬元以上、與船員熟悉、臨時由船員代爲收藏、結果、竟未搜去、殊屬萬分繳幸、</p>
<h3 id="c139">强刦民船 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>該輪於二月一日下午二時許、開到惠州附近九龍山海面、距香港約有九小時海程、海盜準備離船而去、並在船上、吹海波螺爲號、召覓民船、良久不得、最後發見一大帆船、海盜令其駛近、距該帆船亦係盜船、船内有匪三男一女、曾與通州輪匪發生衝突、後經通州輪中四匪放舢板、躍上該帆船、方始將其扣得、令其靠近通州、搬運贓物、以備載至九龍山畔而去、</p>
<h3 id="c140">刦去貨物 <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>海盜臨行時、將貨艙打開、取出洋布十箱、携往數十疋、又襪子一箱、橘子五桶、糖果一箱、均駁入帆船、輪内有郵件兩袋、亦爲匪打開、檢視有無貴重物品、結果、未有所取、郵筐一只、裝有郵票二十五萬元、被匪撕破數張、亦未取去、五箱鈔票、雖未簽字、匪首仍其刦去、據稱、渠尙有大頭領、必須取去交代也、各船員衣服被刦者、僅二買辦、損失數襲、賬房間内職員被褥、亦有被取去者、</p>
<h3 id="c141">綁架未成 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>匪盜離船時、原欲於華人旅客中、綁架七人、爲勒贖地步、當各肉票下舢板時、船上水手、告以舢板太小、不能容留多人、匪即放回三人、僅帶去四人、至九龍山畔、其時一部海盜先押贓而去、一部則與各肉票同行、所幸香港英海軍、巳得上海公司電託海岸巡防處、轉電香港海軍、請爲搜索、故派出飛機二架與我國飛機一架、飛來偵察、飛行甚低、海盜大驚、又復上船、拖大副與電報員各一人上舢板、以爲護符送其上由、該舢板至山麓、盜因忽惶間、而將舢板覆於海邊、</p>
<h3 id="c142">飛機偵察 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>飛機飛近船邉、視察明瞭、擬擲炸彈、船主大驚、因舢板内有大副及無綫電員在内、急在輪上書大字、請勿擲彈、勿追撃匪盜、以保全各人生命、飛機乃去、通州輪見第一舢板巳毁壞、急再放一舢板、而將大副電員旅客等載回、被拆去無綫電機、亦經船主向匪索回、重行裝置、故通州開船、巳在一日下午三時許矣、</p>
<h3 id="c143">舊事重提 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>海盜在船、曾向各船員言、九年前行刦通州、亦爲若輩所爲、大頭領現巳換人、弟兄們仍是我輩、山内有數千人賴此生活、又稱、余輩如在上海行刦、本領較當地之盜爲巨、但不願刦將本求利之小商店、今次所以刦通州者、意在銀行鈔票、蓋在銀行損失、比較小商店爲减少云云、</p>
<h3 id="c144">到港檢查 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>匪離輪船、英艦三艘始到、保護通州、向香港行駛、時天色已暗、沿途開射探海燈、指示香港航綫、當夜十一時到港、在香港時、港當局對於全船旅客、詳加檢查、又派大批武裝探捕到輪値班駐防、聞通州船主、因其保全船内英人生命、使七十三童孩、無一受傷、處置得宜、由港政府給奬章一枚、以示功績、受傷二管輪、卽送上醫院療治、肩際彈傷、可無生命之憂、</p>
<h3 id="c145">旅客換船 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>

<p>規定車租票準　　車委會第二步之重要工作、爲减低車租、規定標準、八月七日經董事會核定、嗣後車租爲每日大洋七角八分、據從前調查、車租之高、乃達一元一角、是車夫巳頗有裨益、惟車租標準之是否遵行、監查甚難、蓋租車旣非論全日、而係分班、而車主方面又有向車夫收取欠債、以及房租等項、乃致含混不淸、車委會巳令所有額外收入、另賬登記隨時備查、但最大之困難、厥爲車夫不敢與車主當面對質、蓋恐得罪車主、將致無車可拉也、故車委會只有以别法、實行監察、必要時則撤消車照、或扣留車照、以爲懲戒、至於車租數目、將來尙應减至小洋八角、即約大洋六角、</p>
<p>包車夫之登記　　車委會再進一步之工作、爲登記一切人力車夫、使之遵章領照、上年九月一日、起先登記自用人力車（包車）登記方法、先考問行車章程、繼行體質檢騐、並試其耳目是否聰明、旋即拍照、兼打指印、並予以防疫注射或種痘、有演講員向之宜講拉車時應行注意各事、旣畢、則給予執照、授以臂章、十一月間、與法租界當局商定辦法、將包車夫領照一事、定爲强制施行、自十一月一日起、無執照者即不准再行拉車、至年終時、包車夫全已登記、共有一萬三千二百六十二人、登記費每人一元　　黄包車夫領照　　公用人力車車夫之領照登記、原計畫共登記四萬人、由車主推薦三萬、　工部局再另選一萬、若登記進行滿意、其餘之一萬、亦或可令車主推薦、自十一月起、巳將　　之空白單分發車主、登計則於十二月起、計　　　辦畢五千八百餘人、計剔出不合格者約　　　二、至登記之手續、與包車夫相同、惟於演講　　、特别説明雖由車主推薦、而對於該車主並　　　　　、又告以車夫互濟會之組織、及其工作、而登記費亦巳由該會代付矣、</p>
<p>推行模範新車　　車委會爲車輛淸潔穏妥起見、特　　　　人力車之標凖、惟車主方面、異議甚多、　至十二月底、此項標車、巳經發照行駛者有二十　　、至本年一月底可有一百五十部、同　　主力　積存舊式車未用之材料、據稱可配造一　　　　之多、車委會乃允許、如果車主方面、　　　之登記、盡力合作、則此項舊式新車、許其　　　　十部、以爲替换之用、</p>
<p>創辦互濟會務　　　　　夫起見、車委會乃提倡車夫互濟會之組織、其會費來源、係由車主代向車夫收集、而每車每月先行墊交大洋一元五角、若社會人士有表同情而願助欵者、亦甚歡迎、至其組織、則由工部局推定基金委員三人、更設一理事部、延聘社會熱心人士七人、連同車主代表二人、基金委員三人、合議主持、一俟車夫登記之後、當即由車夫公舉代表、加入理事部、互濟會之目的、在爲車夫設備醫藥·浴所·住屋·學校·合作社·儲蓄會·以及娛樂與傷亡敎濟、現在開辦伊始、暫在北區及西北區各設中心一處、東嘉興路爲總會所、計佔地一萬六千方呎、兼有同面積之屋頂花園、二月間即可正式開幕、理事部理事均盡完全義務、互濟會捐欵之收入、除需撥付車夫豋記費四萬元外、均用於事業費、及需用辦事人員之薪金、車夫方面之捐欵、大約每班捐銅元十一枚之譜、車租旣巳規定减低、則此數當不難於担負也、</p>
<p>此外上年工作　　尙有規定車資表、改良車燈、修正執照章程、取締野雞包車等項、至關於法租界及市政府方面、車委會均遇機合作、惟甚希望以後三市區、均將車照直接發與車主、關於車委會一九三五年之工作、其進行自無問題、而其發展如何、當視車主之態度而定、惟工部局對於改善車夫之境遇、及改良車輛之情形、係屬旣定之方針、此則一般人士所不可不知者耳、</p>

<p>同時發表自己之意見</p>
<p>主張舶來敎育中國化</p>
<p>｜十敎授答復毫無背景以復興民族爲目的｜日前北平燕大副校長兼天津大公報敎育欄主編劉廷芳博士、因事過滬、往訪署名一十宣言之諸人氏、對於一十宣言、有所商討、茲誌其談話情形如下、</p>
<p>該敎授等見劉氏相訪、即請其對一十宣言之主張發表意見、劉氏謂吾輩係多年老友、現在要很不客氣的先提出三個問題、請求答覆、㈠此次中國本位文化建設運動有無政治背景、㈡諸位對於文化統制問題取何種態度、㈢此次運動最後的目的是什麽、希望簡單説明、以便北返後據以答覆友好之訽問、</p>
<p>該敎授等答稱、㈠我們的一十宣言純以私人的關係、從學術的立塲未發表我們十人一點共同的意見、不但我們的行動没有付麽背景、而且亦並不代表我們十人所服務的機關、不過自從宣言發表以來、不但全國各界領袖表示相當同情、給我們許多指敎、就是當局方面亦因我們這種運動、純以學術爲出發點、給我們一種自異發展的機會、</p>
<p>㈡我們十人的宣言、無非援國家興亡、匹夫有責之義提出一種愚見、請求國人指敎、這和文化統制問題絶不發生什麽關係、我們以爲倘使果能集合全國專家、對於建設中國本位文化的意見、討論出一個結果來、而求得一箇復興民族的途徑、供我們大家參考、似乎是一件値得做的事、㈢我們最後的目的、當然是復興民族、就是怎樣建設中國本位的文化、以求中國民族的復興、日本人常説、現代國際的戰爭是全國國民智能之爭、我們以爲不但戰爭如此、就是現代民族的生存競爭、亦何嘗不是如此、所以我們的愚見、以爲中國本位的文化建設實是刻不容緩的工作云云、</p>
<p>劉氏繼稱、他自己從事敎育多年、而且是明日敎育社的社友、那個敎育社主張、㈠中國原有的敎育、應該更進一步而使之科學化和生産化、㈡凡是外來的敎育、都應該中國化、所謂中國化就是要適應現在的需要、而且要日新又新、不是回到故紙堆中去討生活、㈢敎育事業因集思廣益、擇善而從、不宜由一派去包辦、因他本有這種見解、所以對一十宣言的主張、大致可以同意、不過他説他旣信奉基督敎、所以認宗敎爲文化的一部份、不能除外、而且在復興民族的工作上亦有相當的需要、不過亦應使之中國化耳、最後劉氏並允北返後、當將十人的意思、轉告北方各友好云云、聞劉氏巳於當日下午乘平滬通車逕返北平矣、</p>

<p>有人説：靑年時代如（走盤珠），憑着他的熱心勇氣，不論幹甚麽事？都不畏縮，不懈怠。到了中年，並在他的熱心勇氣上獲得一種權位時，就會一變而爲（算盤球），他只知打算盤謀進益了。一到晚年，優遊歲月，怡養林泉，什麽事都不聞問，那時便如一顆（佛頂珠），僅是擺擺樣子了。此三珠也，可爲中國人的寫照。</p>
<p>在下每作這樣幻想：漢奸的一顆良心，根本没有用處，如果把他剜出來納入辦公事的人們的胸中，那末辦公事的有了雙料良心，一定會做出更好的成績來。再如布爾喬亞們出必舟車代步，他們的兩隻脚，也根本没有用處，如果拿來贈給一班做走狗的，那麽他們有了四隻脚，自然更可博得他主子的歡心了。其他類此尙多，不及備述。然而幻想終於是幻想，古板的造化不肯帮忙，怎能會實現呢？</p>

<p>談相，吾國古書裏頭是很多的，算不得稀罕的事；戰國時候有一位苟子，他主張（非相）的；（稱公孫呂，面長三尺，廣三寸，而名動天下，）這豈不是奇形怪狀的一個面貎？我想中間必定有錯字，大約（三尺），就是（一尺）的誤訛；否則，雖在千百年前有了這一副尊容，不要嚇死人麽？晏子春秋裏也説（成湯的面孔，是兑上豐下，伊尹的面孔，是豐上兑下，）照這種相形講，那末：成湯是（由）字臉，伊尹是（甲）字臉，單就一個人面的大小上下，巳可定他的一生品位；所以左傳上載着（内史叔服，謂穀也豐下，必有後於魯國，）國語也記（魯叔僑如聘於周，王孫説與之語，歸告簡王，言其狀方上而鋭下，宜觸冐人，王其勿賜），魏書云（古弼頭尖，世祖戲呼之曰筆頭，）當時凡人見他都直稱之曰（筆公）；齊書李安民傳（明帝見安民五擲皆盧，大驚，目安民曰，卿面方如田，封侯狀也。（（田）字臉，現在通呌他是四方面孔，這或許相中最完美的相道罷。三國（孫權方頤大口，）據説：口中能容一拳，其父堅奇之，目爲貴相，就是這個意思！</p>
<p>其實人的面首，善相的眼光總在長方，所謂（同）字臉，最爲富貴，格局，儻若一個人，外貎看起來差不多，左右的顋骨偏偏異常突出，依這圖形，是像了（風）字：法學家説：凡是入獄的犯人多是這種相貎，還有像（周）字的形狀，這是最壞的惡相，因爲他只有一面突出，左右成了畸形像（周）字的一（　），你！看，不是妖怪麽？故科學家觀人的面相，就可以拿面骨的角度來定標準；人的智慮，大半不齊，而度量其分寸，没有絲毫不對的；古人説；（人心之不同如其面，）這眞是不錯啊！貴耳集書中，（記）知州，面大而横闊，謚他爲（西）字（臉），可見得面具不常，終不是善類；二十年前，有人題袁世凱像（熊）面，段祺瑞像（鵠）面，黄克强像（豬）面，黎元洪像（牛）面，實在未必相像，不過責備他是侮辱偉人，倒也不可；什麽緣故呢？拿獸面來比人面，讀過書的，總可以曉得三國諸葛瑾爲（驢）面，唐朝的韋挺爲（虎）面，甚至有（猴）面（狗）面，若要舉起例來，哼！眞是不少哩！</p>

<p>（火｜火｜火｜）的呼聲，由喧嚷的空氣中，特别地送進每一個人的聽覺器官裏，於是整條街上，以及二旁弄裏的住戸，都忙亂而慌急地離了溫暖的被窩，很促迫地趕到門外來，一壁戰栗着，一壁探聽着究竟火在那裏。各人的心裏，都充滿着（起火的所在還遠咧，總燒不到我家來）的希望。</p>
<p>濃厚的白烟，猛烈地從弄口的小雜貨店的門窗裏冐出來。濃烈的焦布氣息，籠滿了街和弄。小雜貨店裏，以及小雜貨店的左右鄰居，都失魂落魄的把箱籠物件搬出來。瞧的人是呆呆地瞧着。流氓是十分活躍，想乘機攫奪。巡捕是舉了警棍亂打人，維持秩序。小雜貨店的屋頂上，也開始冐着白烟。</p>
<p>在一陣緊張的聲浪裏，救火車來了。戴銅帽的消防員，紛紛跳下車來，把皮帶接上自來水龍頭，水便像三條大蛇般的鑽進小雜貨店去。不到五分鐘，白烟是停止着從小雜貨店的各處隙縫裏鑽出來了。於是街人的人聲，也逐漸地由喧嚷而靜寂下去。</p>
<p>三條巨蟒般的水，還是不住地鑽進小雜貨店去，街上瞧熱鬧的，都逐漸地散去了，回進未曾冷却的被窩裏，重溫好夢。</p>
<p>到了明天，任誰走過小雜貨店的門口，都得探頭瞧一下那僅存的烏焦的屋壳。圓圓的臉兒上深刻着皺紋的老闆，和那具有一雙很動人的眼波的老闆娘娘，不知漂流到那裏去了。</p>

<p>天上大半輪月亮，在深藍的夜空裏，送了一些靑光到地面上來，在牆角邊，有兩個影子縮着一團。介夫始而也不怎介意，見着一株瘦小的棒樹，伸了半截在黄土牆上，僅僅是這一棵樹，在月亮裏照着，配着那古陋的屋檐，别是一種風味。介夫究竟喝了一點墨水的，忽然那思家之念，油然而生。就高聲念着唐诗道；遙憐小兒女，未解憶長安。他這诗興大發之下，却把牆角上那兩個人嚇苦了，哎喲一聲，有個人影子一閃，好像是幾乎倒了下去。介夫這才明白了，那裏是兩個女人。像小西天這地方，本來每到這夜暮初張的時候，有那批可憐的女子們，在這裏找臨時的出路。其間自然也有知道吃飯要緊，廉恥未嘗不要緊的，這就不敢明目張胆去找客人，只是在暗地裏躱躱閃閃的，等候了茶房出來傳話。張介夫料着也是這種人，便笑道：這也値不得嚇了一跳哇。你們在這裏等什麽人，我去和你傳個信，讓他出來。月亮下，也是很凉的不要受了凉呀。他口裏説着，脚步只管移了過去。在他心裏想，這種女子，那是無所謂的，小西天的客人和他們説話，他們是求之而不得。可是自己只管向前相就時，那兩個女人，只管靠了牆，慢慢的向後退去。介夫笑道：你們不是找小西天的客人嗎？我也是呀。爲什麽····他説着話，巳經杞距得很近，他這算是看淸楚了，前面一個女子，正是朱月英，後面那個，頭上挽個髻。這才覺得莽闖了，怎好亂和人家開玩笑。（一二八）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>至於嘉順皇后和慈禧太后不睦的原因，在胡思敬所著的國聞備乘中，記載得很淸楚。有一段説：（毅皇后（卽嘉順）之立，慈安主之，非孝欽（卽慈禧）意也。慈安旣薨，孝欽益憐愛慧妃，（妃爲鳳秀之女，同治選婚時，慈禧卽欲立之而未果。）諭帝宜加禮遇，無事不得輒至中宮。穆宗（卽同治）重違兩母后意，恒獨宿宮中，鬰鬰不樂，奸人遂誘之遊幸民間。后嘗書（戒嬉）兩字，榜於座隅，以規穆宗，海内皆知其賢。穆宗垂危，后入宮問疾，孝欽惡其不先白己，詰責甚厲。后憤然曰：（妾乘鳳輦從大淸門入，天下皆知：今入宮問皇帝疾，有何罪名？而勞太后詰問）｜孝欽疑后有意譏己，遂大詬曰：婢子，汝以我爲未嘗入大淸門乎？汝由我而入，安知不由我而出）！穆宗崩，遂不爲立嗣，逼之自裁。）這一段話大槪是可靠的。因特爲錄出，讀者看了，再閲下文，便不致没有頭腦了。）</p>
<p>（我們所受的痛苦，眞是一言難盡！）太后接着又説道：（更因體面的關係，不得不隠忍，一直到伊自己尋了短見，我們這才像重見天日似的解脱了！）</p>
<p>不錯，同治后的死，委實是人人皆知是出於自殺的，所以太后自己也認爲無庸再諱飾了；我並且還聽人家説，太后因爲平日素不滿意於同治后的緣故，竟在同治死去之後，故意的諷剌伊，説什麽一個眞正賢淑的妻子該殉夫同死、不應苟且偷生，於是同治后便不能不死了。（譯者按：孝哲之死，慈禧實以全力逼之，非僅冷嘲熱諷而已。費行簡（慈禧傳信錄）載之綦詳。大致謂：慈禧嘗於喪次當衆辱孝哲，並手批其頰，后出，夜竟投繯死）。（二三八）</p>

<p>— 汪放庵</p>
<p>没幾多天之前。北山西路吉慶里，吳缶老令子東邁叔家裏，無意中給我碰到剛來自超山的報慈寺住持廣洲上人。聽他説起：那曾經火燬的香海樓，自從番禺洗冠生先生募資鳩工以後，最近巳趁着尙未梅雪爭春的時節，早完成了。第二天早晨，又在姚處琴先生寓處，再會到廣洲上人，據説：這兩天因爲氣候溫和，水邊籬落，那枝頭一縷縷的暗香，也快浮動了。於是就引起了我超山探梅的興趣。</p>
<p>那天恰是星期例假，我上北站搭了早晨九點十五分的滬杭車，在下午二點多鐘，給車輪送到了臨平，跳下車廂，走到杭塘路汽車站。</p>
<p>在杭塘路的汽車中，没二十分鐘就把我送到了超山，這裏是我熟悉之徑，我走進了龜山西村，爬上了蛇山的山腰，一路上聽着怪悦耳的鄕音，不知不覺地巳到了宋梅亭畔。</p>
<p>報慈寺前，宋梅亭畔，冷寂得很，没有其它的遊客，也没有鄕人，那香海樓，果然巳經恢復舊觀了，並且似乎較舊時的還莊嚴靜穆了許多。我獨個兒徘徊了好久，那老幹横斜歷盡風霜的宋梅，似老僧入定般連枝條也都動也不動。細細的隔着藩籬望去，果然，枝頭己放着寥寥幾朶六瓣的花兒，而含葩待放的花蕊，也點綴得似繁星一樣，那植於對面的新近移種的老梅，看來更爲繁榮，微微的風，時時送來一絲幽香，想來月上黄昏的時候，那光景尤令人留戀咧。</p>
<p>踏進了香海樓的下層，又登樓憑眺了好多工夫，眞不由不想起指點高峰，買山偕隠的夙願。回頭又見那燬後的報慈寺東客堂，也恢復舊觀了，誰説不是廣洲上人的宏願圓成呢？</p>
<p>但是，廣洲上人還没回山，寺裏的知客師，我也懶得和他周旋，在暮色蒼茫中，别了香海樓，又跨上了杭塘路的末班車，回家鄕躭擱了一宵。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，回上海啦，途中又經過超山，然而，這美麗的畫面，一忽兒便掠過了！</p>

<h3 id="c251">文學與科學的關係諸問題 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>關於這問題，本來我巳説過了幾句話；但因有人加以曲解，所以再在這提出來談談。</p>
<p>每一問題的提出和解决，都不能離開了具體的現實；並且在提出和解决的過程中，主要得把意見弄得有系統些。盲拉瞎扯，是一點用處也没有的。我對於這問題的意見，認爲應該從兩方面來提出和解决。一方面是本質的，阐明文學（藝術）跟科學的同一性和差異性，因而推斷這兩者應該有怎樣的關係；另一方面是比較具體的，注意中國目前的狀况，提出應該怎樣來實現上述的這種關係。我的所謂科學，是包括社會科學和自然科學在内的。</p>
<p>第一個問題的提出，是因爲人們向來只注意到文學（藝術）的差異性，忽視了這兩者的同一性，即是説，只注意到藝術是情感的，科學是理知的，因此就以爲這兩者是没有關係或不能相容的；殊不知藝術文學和科學，同是人類認識且變革現實的有力的工具，同是現實發展之反映，儘管藝術家和科學家各有不同的表現現實的方式，但在現實的認識上，他們却有互相密切關聯的一致的方法（認識論及其方法論）。因此在這裏我們找到了文學（藝術）應該和科學密切聯繋的本質上的根據。在過去自然主義派的作家們都利用了自然科學，來創作藝術的作品，然而他們没有正確的方法，結果雖獲得了若干優秀的成果，但同時也帶來了巨大的失敗，因爲他們不能精確地明白人類社會和自然界之質的差别，他們不明瞭（人）是社會關係的總利，而把牠單作爲動物在羣居的塲合來描寫。在不久的過去和現在，另一部分的作家，又單把社會科學的原理應用到文學上來，把現實分割支離，來套進他那狹窄的抽象的槪念中去，結果造出了一大堆的小説公式，詩歌公式等等。不用説，這是創作方法的把握錯誤所致成的。同時，我們在這裏還可以得出一個重要的結論，就是科學（社會科學和自然科學）跟文學（藝術）之眞正的（提携），絶對不是意味着學究式的學問的堆積，而是意味着在認識現實上的恊力共進。就是説文學和科學只有在實踐的過程中才能獲到眞正意義上的結合。巴爾扎克之所以受了（社會科學博士）的榮冠，是因爲他在一定的實踐的限度上，使文學和科學密切聯結起來的緣故。富於自然科學知識的哥德，老早就説過：（弄學問本來不能曉得什麽的，常常要有實踐之必要。）以上所説的話，是我對於文學與科學之互相（浸透）的本質上的意見。有人認爲提出這意見是多餘的，因爲這（在從前似乎是阐明得够透徹了）。可是我覺得這是要使文學與科學（相互浸透）的本質的意義，忽略了這意義，便不能順利地得到眞正的成果。並且在事實上，自詡爲（够徹透）者往往是一點也不（徹透）的，比方説，（文學本是意議形態的下層基礎），（文學是社會科學的一部門）（均見一月十五日本欄），像這類奥妙的話，在（奇文共賞）時也許勉强可獲一席，但用平常的（老生常談）説來，這便是（胡説八道），根本不懂文學和科學之爲何物及其相互關係之本質的意義。</p>
<p>第二個問題是從第一個問題出發的。文學和科學，由於私有的社會制度的障礙，一向是少數人的專有品，並且從來未曾取得眞正的統一。我們旣然在上面肯定了文學和科學的重要的關係，便應該設法使兩者普遍化。在這裏附説一句，把科學單限於自然科學，特别在目前的階段，是完全不理解文學與科學之相互（浸透）的眞義的；這在本質上全然忽視了社會科學對於現階段的中國之重要性。柳是湜先生在（論科學小品文）一文裏，對於這（浸透）問題巳給了具體的許多解釋；現在小品文不但巳和科學結了婚，並且是生起兒子來了。這種趨勢，可以發展到文學科學的結合，我相信在不久的將來，我們會看到像伊林的（五年計劃的故事）之類的作品，因爲這種作品，在現階段上有其重要的社會必要性。在這推進文學和科學眞正地取得聯結的過程中，普遍化或大衆化是最重要的唯一的手段，但不能單把這作爲整個問題的全部意義，而認爲（自然科學與文學的浸透，不是方法的問題，而是主題的取理問題。）因爲普遍化乃是問題在現階段上的（取理）辦法，同時也即文化的敎育的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c252">論詩如論禪 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 笑鶩</p>
<p>詩人常爲了一己的主觀眺屬世界，訴出生活的欲情，搆成詩的内容。雖然風格上容有疏直，飄逸，哀豔，豪放種種不同的流派，要之是純一的柏拉圖式的思想與情調以及表出的Ｐassion則一。詩人的思想是哲學的，不屬於亞理士多德的世界，因之在詩中常常隠藏着一種哲學的觀念，一種禪機。讀古人詩，往往一唱三嘆，如嚼橄欖，其故在此。譬如我們讀到：</p>
<p>（悲落葉，聯翩下重疊。重疊。重疊落且飛，從横去不歸，長蔭交枝昔何密？黄鳥關關動相失。夕藥雜凝霜，朝落翻飛日，亂春日，起春風，春風春日此時同。一霜兩霜猶可當，五晨六日巳颯黄。乍逐驚風舉，高下任飄颺。悲落葉，落葉何時還？夙昔共根本，無復一相關，各隨灰土去，高枝難重攀。一｜｜北魏蕭綜悲落葉。</p>
<p>就可以知道這不單是蕭綜不得意時的舒志之作，而且含有爲了一己的主觀探求人生的哲理在内。這一種妙遠的禪機隠藏在一唱二嘆之間，是無法把牠挖掘出來的。這種不能挖掘出來的妙遠之感，正是詩之可貴的部份。歷來不乏大詩論家，他們的論點雖不一致，而着意於（抓住無窮）則又似乎是不約而同了的。</p>
<p>歷來最澈底實行此義的大詩論家，我以爲莫過於宋代的嚴羽了。嚴羽的滄浪詩話中説：（論詩如論禪，漢魏晋與盛唐之詩，則第一義也；大曆以還之詩，則小則乘禪也。晚唐之詩，則聲聞辟支果也。盛唐諸人，惟在興趣，羚羊掛角，無跡可求。故其妙處透玲瓏，不可凑泊，如空中之音，相中之色，水井之月，鏡中之象，言有盡而意無窮。近代諸君乃作奇特解會，遂以文字爲詩，以才學爲詩，以議論爲詩，夫豈不工，終非吾人之詩也。蓋於一唱三嘆之音，有所歉然。）</p>
<p>這一段話裏，他主張詩要如（空中之音），（相中之色），（水井之月），（鏡中之象），這就是所謂純一的柏拉圖式的思想與情調以及表出的Ｐassion的形式了。他反對（以文字爲詩），（以才學爲詩），乃至於（以議論爲詩），這一種見解不獨堪見重於當時，卽移用之於現代來，亦有其値得重視的價値。我們知道以前必爲嚴羽反對的幾種做詩的人，現在是多得不可以數計。其間以文字爲游戲的固然有，賣弄才情的也不能説絶無其人，至於以領導羣衆自命祗知道（發議論）的大詩人，更是更僕難數。這幾種詩人最大的成就，恐怕除了以粗勁壓迫Ｍnse,使詩壇冷落下來，没有别的再可誇耀的了。</p>
<p>説到這裏，我不曾忘記呌人不要做（詩匠），换句話説，諸如王梵志（寒山拾得邵康節）的俚語偈詞，雖然大富禪機，也未便把牠認爲無上珍品。糊泥湖塗的玩意兒，應該從最大的區别處肅敬迥避。</p>

<p>— 馬克特溫作立波譯</p>
<p>溪西耶·史密呂有一匹母馬｜｜孩子們叫她做十五分鐘小馬，但是，你知道，那不過是開玩笑，自然，她是比那個快點｜｜而且他常常在那馬的身上贏錢，雖然她是這樣慢，而且常常氣喘，昏憒，患肺病，或其他類此的毛病。他們總是讓她兩三百碼、中途總跑過她，但是在賽跑的最後困頓的一段，她一定弄得很興奮，拚命的樣子，跳躍起來，腿子在駕木四　亂踹，有時高舉空中，有時踏在園牆上了，衝起更多更多的糜埃，她的嗆氣，噴啑，噴鼻子，又引起更多更多的喧囂｜｜你可以看到，他趕到終點台邊總是先一個頸。</p>
<p>他有一條細小的猛狗，看看他的樣子好像除了伏在那裏很老實，等着一個偷東西的機會以外，簡直不値一分錢。但是一把他賭起錢來時，他就不同了；他的下顎開始突出，像一條輪船的桅前甲板一樣，他的牙齒會和火爐一樣發光。另一個狗來挑逗他，恐嚇他，咬他，而且兩三次把他從肩頭抛過，安德里賣克孫｜｜這是這狗的名字｜｜安德里賈克孫不會裝佯，只是滿足着，他再也不希望别樣東西｜｜賭注在對方是一倍一倍加增，直到所有的錢都完了；於是，突然，他會攫住另外那狗的後腿，恰恰在那關節上，緊緊咬着｜｜並不撕，你要懂得，只是緊緊吊住，直吊到他們休戰才放口，就令是一年。史密呂在那小狗身上賭總是贏家，一直到他和一個没有後腿的狗周旋的時候，因爲那狗的後腿是被他們用圓鋸鋸掉了，當時機成熟了，錢也通通賭上了，他直取他那珍愛的腿關節，他馬上看到了自己是怎樣被騙了，是怎樣人了那狗籠套。他顯得很吃驚，不久他又非常沮喪，再也不想竄這一仗了，他激動得很糟糕。他看了史密呂一眼，好像説他的心碎了，而且這全是他的錯，他没有拒絶和條没有後腿可以攫取的狗戰鬥，而攫後腿是他在戰鬥中的主要的依靠呀，於是他軟弱無力地走了幾步，就躺下來，死了。這是一條好小狗，那安德里賈克孫，如果他還活着，他是會成名的，因爲他有這種根底，而且他有天才｜｜我知道，如果他没有才幹的話，他一定没有被人談起的際遇，而且他在那種環境之下能够那樣作戰也是不可解釋的了。我一想起他的最後一戰和牠的結局時，我總感到難受。</p>
<h3 id="c254">我的走廠 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>每到了隂歷的一二月間，在朝霧迷濛着，太陽剛正初升的時候，那背着一個小包袱，頭上帶着一頂破篦帽，成羣結隊的臉上蒙着一層悲苦的離情，浩浩蕩蕩，由故鄕的東門外走出去，如十字軍的遠征隊似的，那便是要到三百多里外的箇舊去走廠的人啊。</p>
<p>這此夫走廠的人，多是破産的農民和失業的份子，每年春天去時，大多是那末一副窮苦的流亡樣子。可是到了隂曆的年底回來時，却大不同了：全身穿的是一套簇新的藍大布衣服，頭上帶着紅結子的瓜皮小帽，衣裳是穿了半開着，泛着桃紅色的臉上，帶着幾分發了財的驕傲，人是越發比以前更壯健，見着熟人老是那末笑嘻嘻的，彷佛幹了一椿什麽得意事似的，那樣兒眞使我一見着就非常羨慕！</p>
<p>大槪一面又因爲常和自己在一堆的小朋友，都巳出門去，自已孤零零的一個人守在家裏揑鋤頭，覺得太枯燥了吧？於是，便也想走廠去！</p>
<p>可是，這意見老是給苦着臉的父親駁斥着：</p>
<p>（老子五十多歲了，什麽没有幹過？走廠，你以爲是那樣好幹的嗎？老子從前在廠上就幹過多少年了，｜｜有甚麽好處？從前老子就説過：撒尿摔屎都不再望着箇舊廠了，你還想去？）</p>
<p>父親氣虎虎的，唾沫從没有牙齒的痛嘴裏直濺出。他那意思，我是知道的，他希望我同他一樣的，本本分分的種一輩子的田地，不要再非分的妄想什麽了，因爲他是過來人，他是飽嘗過人間的一切痛苦，而知道命運是怎麽注定了的。可是，我頑皮地總是不肯聽父親的話，我的心巳給那些每年從箇舊發了財回來的　傲的人帶到箇舊去了，我要到那發財的想地｜｜箇舊去！</p>
<p>於是，我仍然理想着箇舊，我把自己幻想爲一個未來的大老板，將來發了財，我要騎着一匹雄馬回來，那時，勞苦够了的父親母親，可不必再受人家的氣，替人家當佃戸了。那時要蓋一間自己的房子，不再住那間破土帳房了。···這種種的理想，使我在不知不覺中堅决了心，雖然，父親會講給過我聽：那是一個什麽地方，并且多麽危險，在鑛洞裏隨時都極容易死去，···但我始終還是説要去！</p>
<p>這頑强的堅决，使父親弄得没有法。但在他的心裏，他以爲我年紀還只有這麽小，嘴裏雖然説要去，難道當眞就會去嗎？</p>
<p>這却使他們意料不到：一天早晨，金黄的太陽光剛剛才吻在屋脊上的時候，在他們忙着工作的去不注意中，我悄悄的偷着一頂破篦帽，跟着一個到箇舊去（走水）的熟人，從家裏溜出去了。</p>
<p>這眞是誰也曉不得的事情。躡手躡脚的跟在他的屁股後，一直走到要上船的時候了，那個走水的人才回過頭來看見我，驚異得忙把擔子歇住，帶着不平常的語氣説：</p>
<p>（阿，你要到那裏去？）</p>
<p>（箇舊！）</p>
<p>（你也會走廠了嗎？）那個走水的人看我那末幼稚可笑，不禁哈哈笑起來，向着我取笑的説道：（走廠是只要這頂破篦帽就行了嗎？）</p>
<p>我羞愧的没有説話，他走近來一把拉住我：（回去，回去！····年紀還小得很。等明年長大點時又再去｜｜。）</p>
<p>（不，今年我要去！）</p>
<p>（嘿，那是你去得的地方嗎？）</p>
<p>他説着，不管我哭着依不依，緊緊的揑着我的手桿，像拉一個犯人似的，把我送回家裏去了。</p>
<p>這一次的委屈，很使我難過。但到了第二年，在無情的生活的壓迫下，没有一個人再阻止我，讓一個不知事的十一二歲的孩子，孤獨的遠離開家鄕到那陌生的地方，去嘗人生的第一杯苦酒去了。</p>

<h3 id="c256">小娘船 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭兆甲</p>
<p>冬日夕陽斜着那山邊深紫的山峯中，巳習慣於物質生活中的村莊上的少爺們，摸出了掛錶看一看時光，他們偷偷地裝上了大量的錢在綢製的衣袋裏，忽忽地走出自家的牆門，到停靠在那小江旁邊的小娘船上去了。</p>
<p>在那僻靜的地方，離開村莊不遠的小江邊，停靠着三四條小娘船，船裏有歌聲，歡笑聲，傍晚，平靜的江面漸漸地抃踊了起來，掀起了給人們無限的歡樂和煩惱。</p>
<p>村莊上有錢而愛好風流的哥兒們，都偷偷地溜集到那兒在狂飲和歡樂聲中，他們每一個都像失却了知覺一般，忘懷了家中老太爺二筆嚇人的鬍子，忘懷了老娘紅着眼睛，在丈夫面前替兒解釋一切的痛苦的情形，更忘懷了自己懺悔時的情緒，而沈醉在小娘的懷抱之中。</p>
<p>小娘把吃得泥醉的客人安放到後艙，客人一手把船娘抱在懷裏，拖到一條墊着席子的木板牀上，做着各種不同的玩意兒，船娘一絲没有不耐煩的樣子，經騐告訴她有錢的少爺們皮氣大，不好惹，服侍得週到，回頭來賞的花錢亦大的。</p>
<p>到了黄昏時那一班失神的人回來了，醉得如泥的人，給船娘用冷水灌醒了過來，彳亍彳亍的踱進自家的牆門，跑回自己的房裏忘去了寒冷，腦子裏像灌了水銀一般，恍恍惚惚的，老太爺二筆嚇人的鬍子和老娘哭紅了的一雙眼睛，那印象漸漸地又鑽人了各人的記憶之中，好在一年只有一次那麽的歡樂，他們這樣自己恕罪着自己，但爬上了牀，這夜始終睡不人眠的，爲了船娘的窈窕的身段，和豐滿的肉體的誘惑！　　晚上，小娘船上又換了另一翻人物，年靑未婚的農夫們一個個都抱着無限的熱望，亦躦進了船艙，他們都在家裏灌醉了老酒來的，他們預備在這裏過一個甜蜜的冬夜。</p>
<p>船娘們把那一些少爺打發走了，爲的是留着一個牆門裏的少爺在自己的船裏過夜，是很危險的。假使少爺們的家裏在她們船上找到了，那可不是玩的，自己的船被押到縣裏去還不算，回頭來不但自己拿不到錢，還要遭到船婆的一頓毒打，因爲牆門裏的老爺們勢力大，有名聲，他們知道了自己的兒子做了這種事，那還了得呢？因此她們對於要留夜的客人是調查得十分詳細，農人們因爲没有勢力，亦没有聲望，因此船娘們亦安安心心的抱着他們睡覺了。</p>
<p>小娘船在村莊上的小江邊過了冬天，春天她們的規例是不做生意的，開往到别處去了，到了來年的冬天她們又停靠在這裏，船上的小娘們當然有的換上了新的，然而一年比一年更時髦了起來，因此每年城裏女人們的新花樣亦被他們帶到這寂寞的村莊裏來了。</p>
<p>每年小娘船開往到别處去了之後，在那小江邊的垃圾堆中，能够見到他們遺留下的，用稻草和席子包着的一個血淋淋的東西，那是小娘們生下的没有足月的嬰孩，到了春天江水漲上灘上時，那小娘們生的東西，隨着江水亦冲流到别的地方去了。</p>
<p>然而在近幾年中，停着小娘船僻靜的小江邊，冬天巳換上了二三條的土匪船了。</p>

<h3 id="c257">談環境適應 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>據生物學家告訴我們，一切的生物都是要適應環境繕得去生存的，乃至一個小蟲身上的綠色，也是爲適應那草地的碧色，避免捕捉之故。至於人類，當然也不能例外。不過這號爲萬物之靈的人類，在適應那較複雜的環境，所以技巧與手段也來得更其高妙。我們平常晝夜操作，過着與千萬人一樣的平凡生活，可是有的時候，個人的意志與周遭環境發生了衝突，這就是一齣悲劇的演出了　柏格森説；吾人平日總有兩重人格，一種是和平的，退襄的，保守的，而另一種是暴戾的，恣瞧的，破壞的，平日處世時出現的都是前者，而後者則出現於此人和社會衝突之際。我們如果撫躬自問，這話眞未嘗没有道理。一到悲憤來時，眞覺得天地雖大，没有自己容身之處，或是環顧四方，無人可語的氣槪，在這裏，就用得着環境適應的敎訓了</p>
<p>人本來是社會的動物，不能像魯濱孫那樣離羣索居地過生活，全社會的人類是與自己息息相關的，在過去許多自命爲孤獨的詩人説他是衆醉獨醒地存在着，可是他總不能離開這所謂（衆醉）的社會吧？這事情仔細想來眞是一種滑稽。一方面憎惡着周遭的人，一方面又不能同這些人眞正隔離，其結果，不是使自己失去别人，就是使别人失去自己，兩條路的盡端都是悲劇，旣然知道個人主義只是畸形的人生態度，旣然知道人的本性中是存着天生的好羣性，旣然知道不能强社會以從一己，那麽何如翻然改關，矯正自己冷僻的地方，去適應這社會，改良這社會呢？消極的態度是不可師法的，那不僅無裨於社會，並且自己生存都成了問題，牢騷，悲憤，抗爭，結果，只會機成無理性的瘋狂，被人們譏笑爲傻子。説句不客氣的話、這是廉價地拍賣了自己的人生！</p>
<p>固然，我們不能否認，一般純潔的靑年，對社會上的黑暗面　惡面是得感到慘惡了，同喫肉打哈哈的人終日相處，見面來兩句：（今天天氣：哈！！）或是吃一席花酒來人圈麻將，其開始當然是忸怩不安的，但久而久之，習慣成爲自然，隨亦向濁流巾盡力沉溺下去，尤其是値在我們這中庸的微溫的富有黏性的民族中，不多幾年，一個生氣虎虎的靑年便被環境陶治得揖讓進退，火氣毫無，做成了過去爲自己所僧惡過的人物。這樣的環境，要適應也並非易易呢！</p>
<p>可是，我們因此就逃避嗎？社會是險惡的，人生是崎嶇的，旣然生而爲人　就負擔着這筆路藍縷披荆斬棘的責任，相信這環境是個大的鎔爐，祇有從這　　練出自己的人格來，至於適應環境者，則是在處世之時不猖狂，不逃避，卅古伐哲人的｜句話卽是（和而不同）而已！</p>

<p>— 許席珍</p>
<p>（聽説旅行阿非利加的荒遠的沙漠的人夜夜走過的夢境，是美麗的故國的山河。</p>
<p>｜｜廚川白村：苦悶的象徵）</p>
<p>又）夜，我夢見了美麗如神話中的仙島那樣的，幼年時代的笑，與小小的故鄕了。</p>
<p>（那兒迷漫着霧一般的詩意的朦朧｜｜霧，是帶着淸晨的氣息的啊。</p>
<p>於是：一個個的春天，家門前短籬上的野薔薇也開起了，葡萄籐靑靑地，綩綸曲折地漫延到無窮盡的長：從這兒，大讀出了一絲絲的柔和的情調。月亮，　夜夜的用着古鏡的姿態呈現了，照着這小鄕村的恬靜，照着一種種的明朗的小夢，照着許多幼年時代的坦白。小川裏的水流動着像雲的飄浮，淡泊中却有着無限的歡忻｜｜是人世界的原始的形態，也是生之流動的明調的交響樂啊。</p>
<p>一個早晨，一個晚上，人伴着小寺裏的低幽的鐘聲，恬靜，深遠：於是：像老山羊的迂執那麽地，陷入深深的思維中去了｜｜人思維一顆星，一片花辦，一滴溪水，一粒種子，一片輕快的雲。</p>
<p>憂思呢？恐怖呢？磨折呢？傷害呢？</p>
<p>人間的可怕是没有的｜｜也許它們是隠伏在一個不可知的地層中吧。</p>
<p>人世間是永永地美麗的，像滿簇的火花一樣的啊。）</p>
<p>然而，當醒來的時候，我又一次地發覺了：我重又受了一次欺騙｜｜一個夢的欺騙啊！</p>
<p>自家兒是孤獨地旅行在人世間的菲洲中的｜｜没有盡頭的荒漠呢。</p>
<p>土地是貧瘠的，一千里，一萬里，没有靑靑的小草，也没有潤濕的水點。污濁的沙粒在風中飛揚起來，迷住了人的眼睛，也窒息了人的呼吸｜｜荒漠上是：連太陽都是被當作惡毒的，兇酷的啊。</p>
<p>是吧？荒漠是没有盡界的，横在人底前面的，是一大片一望無垠的沙塲：旅人走着又走着，可是終於禁不住開始懷疑了，這荒漠的旅程的本身，所代表的意義是什麽呢？</p>
<p>説是尋求人世間的奇蹟吧；可是　可欵的語句，有誰能相信呢？｜｜生活的荒洲可不是有着天鵝絨般的舒適的啊｜｜而相反地，那兒不是分明充塞着枯萎，乾涸，嚴酷，與一千種的剥削的自然現象的嗎？給抛在荒漠中的行旅人，所祈求的不是珠光寳氣的奢華的輝煌，而却是一些平凡的自然界的産物呢：一朶靑靑的小草，一朶乳白的百合花，一滴露珠，一口潤濕的空氣。</p>
<p>然而給流放到生之荒漠上來的人，就這一點祈望都給不允許的啊。</p>
<p>荒漠上的靑春是像海面上的鹹味的光風一樣的：於是，旅人的臉上劃出了一條條的痕跡：老年了，可是爲什麽依舊要負着重重的行裝，撿段枯枝當手杖、一步步地，永遠没有休止地顚跛着呢？</p>
<p>説人生是有着傳奇般的美麗的姿態的吧，那樣，也許是聰明的；然而刻劃在荒漠中的行旅人心上的暗影，是始終不允許有辯白的餘地的呢。</p>
<p>這麽着，我將從今天起，開始去學習忍受一種更枯寂的意境了，當知道了終身得殘留在荒漠上的時候，又何必死命地去記憶着另一個世界的美麗呢？</p>
<p>（旅行在菲洲荒漠的人們，夜夜走過的夢境，是美麗的故國的山河啊！）</p>
<p>而如今日，連這美麗的夢都消失了。</p>

<p>踏着煤屑路走去，冬靑樹夾道的行列，十二月的風，顯然是潑悍的，病後的步趾，是帶一點滯澀的。</p>
<p>一顆蠟梅的盤根，剛可做了我的凳子，蠟梅的濃芬，是比混合酒更醉人的。我受不下這樣一種近乎壓迫的誘惑，我的喉口作癢，是差一點會嘔吐的，是哪！我要靜，我要淡，一切太濃太繁華大光榮的甚麽，都爲我所鄙棄。</p>

<p>紙烟於我是頂頂相知，日暮，室中黝黑，燈未明，吻著牠潔白的身體，坐在絲絨面的躺椅上，我的思緒是澄淸的，比秋天的晴空更澄淸，這裏是尋不出一點渣滓，而這時，也正是我最聰明的時候。</p>
<p>過後，我是陷入於無可解脱的錯誤的，偏見在我的心窩發酵，於是，我看不起女人，女人應是性的奴隸嗎？她們爲了要顯示她們性的本能的偉大，而盡量地暴露着她們所有的誘惑的力量，希冀一些蠢笨的男子，要想得到片刻的快感，甘心地爲她們所役使，這，就十足地表現了她們慾望的自私與心願的鄙陋。</p>

<h3 id="c260">水兵街 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 縱心</p>
<p>永兵街，也是在遙遠的，懷念着的異邦。越南南部商業最繁盛的堤岸埠上，一條頂有名的街道。長得像上海的南京路那麽長呢！</p>
<p>也是（唐山）人聚最多的地方啦！但是，絶對不像一般人所説的異邦裏的（唐人街）那麽　，外國鬼子從街上經過，要掩着鼻子走，表現着野蠻齷齪的中國人的（唐人街）呵！</p>
<p>淸潔的，美麗的，輕鬆的，醉人的南洋之街呵。到過堤岸的華僑，誰也要上水兵街去逛一逛，特别是水兵街之夜。我老遠就忘了可憎恨的異邦；但是，水兵街的容姿，老愛飄上我的心懷裏來。像南洋的夜風那麽輕飄飄的飄上來呢！怪惹人留戀的。</p>
<p>在上海，是我們的祖國，在南洋不消説是相反的異邦。但上海的霞飛路，是有名的像異國之街。虹口公園那一帶，那更不用説了，充滿着異國情調！然而異邦裏的水兵街，却難嗅出一點兒，一點兒的異國氣味。不相信麽？那全像是道地貨的中國本地的氣色哩。</p>
<p>是白種人統治的地方，但是從不嘗看見過一個白種人呢！在堤岸，在水兵街上。他們用不着自己來，他們以極少許的人安居在西貢。這兒的居民，就多柔順啦。水兵街上，更未嘗看過個把像上海那麽威風的白種水兵，安南水兵，中國水兵，更根本没有這回事情。那麽爲什麽名呌水兵街，却不大淸楚。現在，是一條没有水兵的水兵街。</p>
<p>黄昏輕鬆快人的給海風吹來了。澆過了冷水後，輕飄飄的，就愛飄上水兵街。迎着透過全身的像夏夜的凉風，陣陣吹得薄薄的衣衫拂動不休，忘記了多少的（閒塵）！走呀走呀，就每每微笑迎風的走完了長得很長的水兵街。不願意就抛却那輕鬆飄逸得醉入的氣色，常常不厭倦的從走完了的街尾，飲過了冰淇淋，又徐徐的飄回來。一天的忙亂和沉悶，全在水兵街上給飄散干凈了。</p>
<p>統是輕飄飄的走着的行人，前後左右，近處遠處，望着，定眼細看，都全是和自己一色一樣的中國人。很不易認出多少穿着薄薄的黑綢衫袴，滿口嚼着栳葉檳榔的紅唇黑齒的越女。較我們黑了一些的越南男子，也並不多，只是很難看出的雜間着極少數的吧了。是中國人的故鄕吧，我没有絲毫的異邦的感覺，好像不是流落在異邦裏呵。</p>
<p>一家家的大小高矮的商店門口，全給我仔細的看過，很難找出幾家安南人開的店子。有的，就只有老番客們才會知道的，有一些安南婦人，在僻小得難以注意到的店旁小巷内，賣着香烟子。别的任何種商店，都是華僑開設的。老番客們要誚笑着較我們黑些吧了的越南人，笨猪呀，他們那會做生意！非我們中國人來不行，南洋　全是我們華僑開發的。然而，華僑是漸没落，中國人漸被排擠了呢。全是中國華僑開發的；但是，結果華僑是到處受驅了。我回想起繁盛的，美麗的，輕飄的，像中國地方的水兵街，不禁這樣重複的念着。而更懷思：水兵街，而今你是怎樣了呢？會不會冷落多了！南洋的海風，陣陣的，不斷的吹來了夾着些兒血腥的氣味呢！華僑一天天的在衰敗！</p>
<p>和上海的南京路一樣長，一樣繁華的水兵街，我懷念你啦！在這北地寒冷的冬天，被生活迫得心亂了的人，滿身沉重憂鬱的，什麽時候再能輕飄飄的，就愛飄上水兵街？把我萬千的煩惱飄去！</p>
<h3 id="c261">犯罪案件三百二十起 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 三多</p>
<p>工部局警務處呈報一九三四年關於管理監獄情形，一月一日在華德路監獄有人犯六三一二名，全年中最高數達六三五七名，最低亦六○二○名。</p>
<p>這是在華德路一處監獄而言，已較一九二五年的同一監獄人犯增加三倍。但是三日大晚報載市公安局發表過去一星期中，境内發生犯罪案件共三百二十起，共計男女犯七百八十四名，内以竊盜案爲最多；在短短的七天之中，這數目是太驚人了？</p>
<p>罪犯的激增，自然不是好現像，不過所謂過去的一星期，卽是隂曆的年關，而最多的是竊盜罪，可見這種犯罪行爲的搆成多少直接受市面經濟的影響。中國年來的天災人禍，民不聊生巳是無可諱言，在這紙醉金迷的大都市的表層，果然使鄕下老百姓羨慕是黄金地，然讀了上述兩處的報告，擔心着這大都市的破産不見得是杞人憂天？</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，不謀自身的根本救濟辦法，再是鑼鼓喧天的醉生夢死，這犯罪案件恐怕不是最高的紀錄吧？</p>

<p>— 俞人英</p>
<p>看一輪旭日掉在水平線下，碧藍的波濤映着太陽淡黄的光。探海燈强烈的光綫，又逼耀出來，旗語手頽喪地下了差。</p>
<p>一個（金戒子）的烟囱，在地平綫上攢了出來。慢慢地淸晰，慢慢地模糊。這孤獨征路上的生活者啊！燈山的冬天，海洋風的旋律里更其凄凉。燈舍的電燈統明亮了，在黑暗里，探海燈的光綫，在一無邊際的海洋裏，牠主宰着這一帶海岸綫上航行者的安全。</p>
<p>捱過了一夜天的枯坐，把聽筒慢慢地放下來；一個同伴接替了我的工作。夜里，海水打着這一里路外的岩石，寂靜里；像有節奏的音樂似地響着。風從這燈舍鋼骨牆邊括過，把頭顱靠着這逐漸枯黄下來的粉牆，借着十六支的燈光；翻着一個月以前Ｓ地的報紙。</p>
<p>（這荒島里的生活者啊！）低低地歎一口氣，腦筋裏轉到孩時讀的（魯演遜飄流記）上面去了！</p>
<p>烟聽裏的捲烟，很疏散地躺着；剩着這最後的一聽！</p>
<p>（解糧船）或許明天就會並靠這個第Ｘ號燈山。</p>
<p>（牠會帶來了故鄕的消息吧？）一陣憂愁的隂影在腦箱里掠過，望着窗外是一片漆黑。海的咆哮在寐靜里傳來，看不到這蔚藍海水的滾流，牠的偉大的姿勢，映没在黑暗里了｜</p>
<p>偶然從街檑里映進一道探海燈反射的光輝，和從航行的船隻上一陣從煤渣里擠出來回聲的怒吼。</p>
<p>第二天，隂暗的天氣里踏進這間無綫電報室）。看到同伴一夜窘頓下這一副淸瘦的臉龐，掠過眼前的蜂鳴機和聽筒這二件生活的傢俱，擠下二滴孤獨者的眼涙。</p>
<p>海，掠過了海鷗自由飛翔的姿勢，和偶然幾點商輪的影子，迤山脚的幾艘帆船的飄浮。荒島上，這幾個熟練的同伴的輪廓，這旗語手沉默的態度，海上半生的飄泊；吹老了他棕色的皮膚。</p>
<p>（何時脱離了這孤獨的牢籠呢？）看落日的光輝又映在蔚藍的水面上了！</p>
<p>在燈山，又是過了一個冬天。</p>

<h3 id="c270">重返好萊塢的過時皇后波拉奈葛麗之過去與未來 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 亦敏</p>
<p>恐怕已經没有人能記憶起這好萊塢的過時皇后波拉奈葛麗Ｐolanedri了，自從她主演了一部ＡＷomanＣommands以後，已經退養了差不多有二年多，據一般人的推想，以爲她將從此優遊林下，不再入影界了。</p>
<p>然而她在好萊塢悠久的歷史，使她並不願意長此抛棄的。老於熟悉影界掌故的人們，都知道她是開好萊塢妖艶作風的風氣之先者，葛萊泰嘉賓也不過是一個後起，所以崇拜她的好萊塢人們，對於她的去休是非常的惋惜，而相信她必不致於一去不返的。</p>
<p>她也是没有學過英語不能攝製聲片而去的一個，她是波蘭人，當她在好萊塢被選爲皇后的時候，許多人去恭賀她，她祗能伸出手背來給人握。她演了ＡＷomanＣommands以後就到歐洲去，她在這二年中，學習了很流利的英語而重返好萊塢了。她的重振旗鼓之消息傳播出去後，驚動了不少影界的人物。</p>
<p>波拉奈葛麗的年齡現在亦已不小了，她在過去是影界裏最深於愛情的女子，曾經屢次跌入了情網之中。却利卓别麟也是和她熱戀過的一人，曾有許多人傳稱卓别麟和她是結過婚的，但是這種傳説究竟没有明白地證實，當時她却坦然地宣布爲了卓别麟的緣故使她長久留在好萊塢的。</p>
<p>最爲一般人所不能忘的，就是她和范倫鐵拿的一段故事了，當時人言嘖嘖，説波拉内心中的人僅有一個范倫鐵拿，但不幸的范倫鐵拿早年逝世，在他的靈前悲泣最傷心，因而暈厥過去的，就是波拉奈葛麗，可見波拉對於范倫鐵拿確實有相當關係的。</p>
<p>但是波拉曾經嫁過幾次，太子美伐拿也是她離婚的丈夫中之一人。此外如威廉海士，羅特拉洛克等都曾一度爲她的情人。她的一生竟如一幕戲劇，追述　畫，在無聲影片的時代她曾立志把自己所經過的事情，編成一張影片的劇本，但事實上却没有成功。</p>
<p>重返影境的波拉，是否能够繼續巳往的聲望呢？這是好萊塢人們所急於討論的</p>
<p>許多人相信波拉是一個急流勇退的人物，她在五年前是影界裏的第一流紅人，卽如嘉賓，克萊拉實，瓊克拉馥那一般前輩對她亦都甘拜下風的。她所感缺憾的是不能够説英語，聲片覇佔了影壇後的好萊塢，使她明白自己的缺點，不能有絲毫的留變，那麽她的重返好萊塢，一定有了相當的把握，這是無須顧慮的了。</p>
<p>她在好萊塢的歷史上是造成妖艶作風的一人，現在妖艶作風業已經過了一次掃淸的運動而漸漸消沉了，或者她的重返影壇，將改變以前的作風，亦未可知。</p>
<p>又有人説好萊塢老皇后曼麗特蘭漱之死，波拉嘆息異常，並時常現露着重登銀幕之意，她或將欲取曼麗特蘭漱的地位而代之吧。</p>
<p>波拉回來後的未來，雖然撲朔迷離，但是一般人對於他却抱着絶大的希望！</p>

<p>｜卡爾登映</p>
<p>直到現在爲止，中國的文學藝術作家們還不曾産生出一部是以適當地表現（洪楊事件）這一熱烈悲壯的史實的作品</p>
<p>這一（洪羊豪俠傳）影片和過去所有各種關於（太平天國）的詩，戲，文，等同樣，對於這一偉大的民族解放運動，没有本質的地抓住牠的核心，僅是浮泛地採取了一些表面的過程的塲面；在（英雄造時勢）的觀點上，把洪秀全，楊秀淸等泛浮地寫成（不凡的英雄豪俠），忽視了作爲這一運動的主要基礎的民衆，我們知道洪楊等不是超人，不是憑着個人的力量掀起時代打開天地的人物，而是注入了多量的羣衆意志，纔發揮其個人能力的人物。綏拉菲莫維契在（鐵流）裏這樣分析郭如鶴：（郭如鶴是英雄，也不是英雄，因爲如果羣衆不把他當做自己的領袖，如果羣衆不注入他以主意，那末他是一個最平常的人同時他也是個英雄，因爲羣衆不但注入他以主意，而且追隨着他，服從他好像服從領袖一樣）。</p>
<p>自然，影片（紅羊豪俠傳）中是相當地接觸到羣衆的，同時也是抛離羣衆的。如洪馮等在民衆被官吏横加榷殘時的撥轉馬頭，去找朱九濤；在飢民隊伍中爲飢民所不理，楊秀淸抛下二千石工的出走，羣衆公憤中從官兵手中救了韋昌輝，韋氏倒説，（有勞了諸位，現在事情閙大了，諸位可以各自散去）等。作者有幾處還無意地把洪秀全等寫成機會主義的人物。</p>
<p>同樣因爲要撇開羣衆來寫英雄，所以一個過塲接一個過塲地在介紹與誇大英雄們的週遭，呌觀衆儘看着流水賬似的過塲戲。</p>
<p>石工這一塲面是偉大而有意義的，要是能有機在全片中來應用的話。我想若是作一支比徐志摩的（石工歌）更好的曲子來唱，牠的力量可以比擬（黨人魂）中的（船夫曲）的。</p>
<p>是爲了要飾韋昌輝的王虎辰多做點戲吧，加重了李殿元鞭打這一塲。可惜韋氏那麽不英雄地而服貼地被綁着打，觀衆幾乎懷疑他是懦夫了，這矛盾了韋氏的性格，也殺了戲的風景，</p>
<p>最後我得誠懇地向作者與觀衆進言的，在這中華民族危亡的當兒，（紅羊豪俠傳）的呌我們溫習了民族救亡的運動，乃是値得推重的。</p>

<h3 id="c272">評（玩意世界） <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Babes　in　Toyland</p>
<p>｜南京映｜</p>
<p>把現實和幻想混合起來的喜劇，這就是（玩意世界）這影片的本質。像這種類型的影片，多少是和兒童的理想接近，牠們必定把善和惡明白地對立起來，而主觀地解决的；換句話説，就是善和惡的對立的終極是善的勝利，與惡的潰敗。</p>
<p>存在於人間的，常是惡人的横行，這種惡人又常是不能把他們淸除，所以存在於一般人的意識中的是想有着某種力量來消滅這些惡人，這就構成了他們的幻想。在幻想的世界中惡人一定是可以消滅的。</p>
<p>（玩意世界）的主題，就是以幻想來解决現實的不平的，牠構造出一個玩具的世界（Ｔoyland）來，在這世界中有平安住着的鵝媽媽，三隻小猪，貓琴師，貝寡婦和她的女兒，少年唐郎，兩位玩具匠等但因爲有了惡覇彭乃弼，於是引起他們的不安。彭藉着他的債據。强迫貝的女兒和他結婚，貝和她的女兒當然不願意，但没有法子還他的債。兩位玩具匠竭力想法也無結果，終於只好答應了嫁給他。兩位玩具匠就設法，假扮新娘，得以撕棄了債約。可是惡覇就設法陷害唐郎説他殺了小猪，被判放逐到（鬼世界）（Ｂogeyland）去，那女兒也跟着去。但這誣陷的隂謀給玩具匠揭露了，惡覇逃到（鬼世界）去，玩具匠也追了去。後來他們在鬼世界逃回，惡覇就帶着大隊鬼兵殺到玩具世界來，幸得玩具匠開動木兵的機括，把一切妖兵鬼將消滅，惡覇也被殺，於是玩具世界又回復了平靜。</p>
<p>雖然這影片還包含着若干錯亂的成份，但牠是非常優美的喜劇，爲廣大的少年觀衆（就是成人也是如此）所歡迎，乃是必然的。導演ＧusＭains及ＣharlesＲogerＳ也是値得我們欽佩的，他把開首的童話世界的空氣佈置得極好，全部影片的織接，也很適當，前後各種事件的關應也没有遺漏，如玩具兵，如史丹納的絶藝這些都預先埋伏得很好。</p>
<p>演技方面，勞萊和哈台仍然如我們所期望着的一般，他們雖然有許多地方可憐，吃了虧，但仍然是很熱心的，這種精神是表現得很充分，我們可以從他們身上發見了人間的愛，與對惡世界搏鬥的熱情。相反地，ＨenryＫleinbach所擔負的惡的方面底代表，也恰如其分地表現了，他的奸笑，他的隂險，使我們認識得很明白，很淸楚。</p>
<p>總之，（玩意世界）可以説是很成功的一部喜劇電，牠更適宜於兒童的欣賞。</p>

<p>— 柳村</p>
<p>大衛看了那只黑豹，立即就想掉頭逃走。他想逃到老漁，漠姆，和愛密柳那裏，或是隨便什麽地方。他想立即離開這從前和樂，充滿着愛的家庭。他雖然小小年紀，但却已覺得屋子裏的空氣，巳經完全不同了。他的母親，本來是溫柔，快活，而十分鐘愛他的，但她現在却不將他摟在懷裏，而靦覥地看着麥得斯東。祇聽見麥得斯東喊着他母親的名字道：（克拉拉，我的愛，你須記憶！你須整飭自己。大衛，孩子，你好？）</p>
<p>一回，又是一個陌生人走了進來，但是屋子裏緊張的情緒，並没有一些鬆懈。那是滿臉冰霜，穿着一身黑衣的婦人。她那兩條濃黑的眉毛，在她鼻子上面接連着。大衛的母親告訴他，那是密司麥得斯東，他的新姑母。那新姑母於是惡狠狠地對着大衛估量了一下，然後説道：（普通地説起來，我是不喜歡男孩子的。孩子，你好？）大衛很短促地答應了一聲，他小孩子的憤怒，不覺在胸中膨漲起來。密司麥得斯東很生氣的説道：（這樣没有禮貌的孩子：）她然後對着他母親説道：（克拉拉，你是個美麗而没有思想的人，治家的事情是不善長的。請你將屋子裏的鑰匙交給我吧。）</p>
<p>這一下子，大衛覺得忍無可忍了。他的母親，他的仁慈可愛的母親，和這些人在一起，像這種樣子！全屋子的空氣，都改變了，裏面已經没有一些歡笑了。他不久又發現了一切的一切都改變了。他並且不能够再睡在他母親的房間裏了。他白天和他母親相處的時候極少。到了晚上，他背書亦不是背給她一個人聽的，而密司脱和密司麥得斯東，亦在一起坐着。這使他背書都背不出了，因爲那兩副冷酷的眼睛瞪住了他，使他的記憶力銷失了。所以每次的結果，總是使他不得不痛哭。他的母親亦爲他而哭泣，哀求着密司脱麥得斯東饒恕他年穉無知。</p>
<p>但是麥得斯東却偏偏不饒恕他。他將大衛拖到自己的屋子裏，用一根棍子拿他當作一隻不聽主人命令的狗打着。大衛被他打得哀哭着求告道：（密司脱麥得斯東呀，先生呀，不要！求你不要打我了！先生呀，我是要記得的呀。我要是和我母親兩個人在一起，我一定會記得的，但是你和密司麥得斯東，在我的旁邊看着我，我就背不出來了。我實在背不出來。</p>
<p>密司脱麥得斯東在他臉上揮着棍子説道：（眞的嗎，大衛？我們來試試看。）他説着，就很命地打着他。大衛身上受的痛，和心裏所覺着的恥辱，一時耐不住了，他的小小心靈上的憤恨，一時暴發起來，他將他的頭向着密司脱麥得斯東直撞上去，用牙狠命地咬着他的手。這時房門鎖着，他的母親走不進來，急得她在門外哀哀求告。</p>
<p>大衛被關在屋子裏，無論誰不許去看他，他在屋子裏時時聽見外面有很奇怪的，低低説話的聲音。最後，壁各德偷偷走得他的房門口，低聲告訴他，他不久就要有一個小兄弟，或是小妹妹了。他打着房門，哀求着放他出來。但是現在巳經没有人理睬他了。到了後來，房門忽然開了。他像一隻可憐的小狗似的，爬到樓下，走進了那間寂靜隂慘的屋子。他最後尋到了壁各德，她告訴他説：（你的媽媽，那個可愛的寳貝···他巳是···）大衛悄然地道：（她是死了。）壁各得説：（你的小兄弟，可憐的小東西，他亦死了···）（未完）</p>

<p>Tianjin: The issue of the provincial government moving to Baoding has not been finalized after personnel were sent to Baoding to investigate the houses. According to sources, there are many difficulties in moving the provincial government to Baoding. One reason is that tax revenue will decrease by more than 600,000 yuan, and finances will become even more stretched. Another reason is that the Baoding Governor's Office is dilapidated and difficult to repair, and funds for relocation and other expenses are currently difficult to raise. Therefore, it is feared that it will be difficult to realize in the near future. (7th China News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>The Xu Bandits Collapsed and Retreat, Burning Civilian Houses</p>
<p>Guizhou Bandits Are Hungry and Exhausted, Lacking Fighting Strength</p>
<p>Chongqing: After the Yang Xiuchun unit of the Deng Army in northern Sichuan defeated the bandits occupying the Hewan Dam and crossing the Jiaoling River, the bandits fled towards the Chejia Dam and Yangmo Dam areas and concentrated their main force at the Chejia Dam, attempting to resist stubbornly. The Yang division recaptured Chejia Dam from Zengjia Bridge. On the morning of the 6th, the bandits retreated to Yangmo Dam. The Yang division took advantage of the victory to pursue and recapture Yangmo Dam at noon. The bandits split into several small groups and fled towards Nanjiang. (7th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: When the Xu bandits collapsed and retreated in Wanxuan Dading and other places this time, the houses and markets along the main roads were mostly burned by them. It is said that they knew they were in a desperate situation, so they did this. The people in the bandit area hate them even more, and there are often those who rise up and automatically kill the bandits. (7th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Since the Guizhou bandits in northern Guizhou were defeated, there are less than 10,000 who fled in groups, and the rest are in small groups. Recently, more than 1,000 could not bear the hunger and desperately fled back, and were scattered by our Da Brigade, capturing more than 100 bandits. It is conceivable that the bandits have run out of bullets, are suffering from illness, and are hungry, exhausted, and disorganized. They really have no fighting strength or courage. The remaining group of only a few thousand is currently foraging for food and looking for roads in Zhenlongshan Ganzi Slope and other places in Lan territory. A small group of more than 2,000 have no contact with Fan Brigade and are about to collapse. (7th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

One group of about 4,000 to 5,000 people fled to Huo'e Pond and Lianglukou on the evening of the 4th, pursued by Zhang Brigade and intercepted by Zhou Brigade. One group was ambushed by Liu Brigade at the side of Sancha River and pursued by Da Brigade, fleeing towards Luowo. About 2,000 people scattered and hid in the deep mountains and caves in the areas of Guangxi Muyu He'e and Liuying. (7th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Rural Loans Are Worth Commending <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Various Chinese banks in Shanghai recognize that revitalizing rural areas is a pressing matter. Therefore, there is the organization of a loan syndicate. Although the specific loan methods are not yet determined, the principle of providing loans to rural areas has been endorsed by the financial community and is regarded as an effective way to help rural areas. It can be said that the problem has been truly identified. But let's see how it will be implemented in the future.</p>
<p>The development of cities in our country initially centered on politics, and then extended to commerce. In the past, the old capital Beijing and the provincial capitals all followed this pattern. Until the opening of the sea ban, the coastal ports had increasingly frequent communication with overseas, and the commercial foundation gradually solidified. However, because the industrial structure could not be established, everything was difficult to develop as a result. At the beginning of the world economic panic, our country, as a silver-using country, was affected by imports but benefited from exports. Unfortunately, at that time, it was too ignored and it was not possible to take precautions so that when the panic struck, there was nowhere to defend. Since the industrial structure of our country is not sound, the products of light industry cannot be promoted overseas, nor can they grasp the domestic market. In the end, industry and commerce are in trouble. Even the existing urban prosperity is almost impossible to maintain.</p>
<p>The number of direct import and export by commerce of our country to foreign countries has always been small. For the relationship between overseas needs and supply, not very well understood. Therefore, it is often easily manipulated by foreigners. Its export of raw materials depends on rural areas, and the import of goods is also mainly in rural areas. The consumption of large and medium-sized cities still depends on the economic situation of rural areas. In the past two years, good harvests have led to disasters, followed by drought and agricultural vitality has been almost exhausted. In addition, the two incidents of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident not only eliminated the strength of North China that could provide funding, but also caused a major blow to prosperous Shanghai. The alarming excess of imports continues unabated year after year. The people's strength is becoming more and more exhausted. The sluggish market is even more profound. Invisible input is also reduced due to the decrease in overseas Chinese remittance. Urban industry, commerce and agriculture suffer from the same disease. Today, if you want to find a way to regenerate, you have to wait for the restoration of rural vitality.</p>
<p>The depletion of agricultural production has been going on for a long time. The self-sufficient environment of rural areas in our country has been broken for decades. Even rice and wheat are not enough to use. The lack of support for agriculture itself is evident. Even in terms of the income of sideline occupations, such as silk and tea in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, tung oil, sugar cane in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, wool and cotton in North China, etc., are all major sources of agricultural income. Since countries have been striving for self-sufficiency, silk and tea have shown decline. The remaining various products such as wool and cotton have rarely continued to improve. If this continues, rural areas will inevitably go bankrupt. At this time, it is appropriate for the banking community to invest in rural areas. One is to eliminate the excess floating capital in cities, and the other is to irrigate rural areas, which is to indirectly promote cities. However, there are some points that need to be paid special attention to when lending to rural areas.</p>
<p>First, the interest rate should be low. Farmers are now struggling and cannot bear the heavy burden. When banks lend, they must first consider their own safety. If the interest rate is too high, resulting in agricultural production not enough to support consumption, there are many dangers. Not only is it unfavorable to the bank itself, but it also loses the original purpose for agricultural revival.</p>
<p>Second, the term should be slightly longer. The transformation time of agricultural production is generally at least half a year in the Yangtze River basin, and even nine months to a year in the provinces of the Yellow River basin. Therefore, the timing of collection and release should be considered based on the actual conditions of the rural areas in order to achieve mutually beneficial effects.</p>
<p>Third, promote sideline occupations. It is not easy to restore industries such as silk and tea that rely solely on overseas sales. In the future, we should engage in promotion based on the local situation and the extent of general consumption, so that the products can be sold smoothly and agriculture can also benefit. The recovery of loans will no longer be a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Dissolution of the Yugoslav Parliament <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>General Election to be Held on May 5th</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia – The interim government has ordered the dissolution of parliament and set a new election for May 5th. The new parliament will convene on June 3rd. Political circles are surprised by the sudden dissolution, as the fiscal year is set to begin on April 1st and the new budget has not yet been passed. It is generally believed that since Prime Minister Jevtic took office, he has begun implementing a plan for political and economic revival. To complete this revival plan, various necessary measures might be delayed due to lengthy budget debates. Therefore, it is better to dissolve parliament and hold a new election so that these measures can be passed by a new parliament that more accurately represents the national sentiment. This is the reason for holding the new election. On June 1, 1929, the late King Alexander I established an autocratic political system and dissolved all political parties. Subsequently, a new constitution was promulgated in 1931, stipulating that political parties could no longer be organized based on religion, ethnicity, or regional boundaries. Therefore, in the May parliamentary election, members of all dissolved political parties will form new political parties to engage in the election. From this, it can be seen that Yugoslav politics will undergo a change of course due to this parliamentary election. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">British House of Commons Debates Draft Indian Constitution <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London – The Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare, attended the second reading of the Indian Constitution Bill in the House of Commons this afternoon. He delivered a lengthy speech strongly refuting the objections of a small number of extremely conservative members of the House of Commons who opposed the new Indian Constitution Bill. Sir Samuel Hoare stated that we should be practical in our actions. The real danger in India is not the National Congress, nor communism, nor bad government, but the lack of accountability. The purpose of the new constitution is to make India responsible for its own affairs, which is the only good way to prevent danger. Sir Samuel Hoare continued by outlining the three key points of the draft Indian Constitution: (1) to establish a responsible government throughout India, with each province having its own responsible government, and to provide technical evidence to prove that this system is feasible; (2) the new constitution has many psychological and social advantages; (3) the new constitution will form a federation of the majority of Indian provinces. This move is merely fulfilling the commitment that Britain has made to the people of India for many years, a commitment that Britain has an obligation to fulfill. Sir Samuel Hoare's declaration made a deep impression on the House of Commons. Although the Indian Constitution Bill will inevitably go through many verbal battles in the House of Commons in the future, its passage in the House of Commons can be considered a foregone conclusion. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London – After the Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare, delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon, the second reading of the Indian Constitution Bill began. Several members expressed their opinions in succession, but none attracted much attention. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Mr. Attlee, and the leader of the Liberal Party, Sir Herbert Samuel, generally agreed with the bill. The only difference was that Mr. Attlee raised some objections, which were the same objections that his party had raised during the House of Commons' discussion of the joint committee report before Christmas last year. The Liberal Party had little criticism, as the extreme Conservative MP Mr. Churchill is currently preparing to attack the draft constitution, and is therefore preemptively advocating for the government. Conservative members expressed their opinions, some supporting the government and others criticizing it. Overall, the government will be able to maintain the support of the majority of Conservatives. It is also possible that some members who have always followed Mr. Churchill may join the government side when voting in the future. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>New Delhi – During today's debate in the Indian Legislative Assembly on the report of the Indian Constitution Committee, Dr. Deshmukh, a member of the National Congress, said that the proposed new Indian Constitution is nothing more than an attempt to create an autocratic monarchy with the assistance of the princes. Mr. Modi, from a Bombay cotton mill, stated that the report does have many improvements and that he is not prepared to reject it. Captain Gakkhar, a representative of the military class, spoke about the demand for the British to withdraw from India raised by extremist members, and stated amidst loud laughter, "I also want the British to withdraw, and for the military class to organize a government within a week, and elect me as commander-in-chief." The government representative, Mr. White Hall, refuted those who criticized the new constitution, saying that the call to reject this bill is a meaningless gesture on the stage, and that India's future is inseparable from Britain. Now that Britain has put forward this method in the spirit of friendship and cooperation, the Legislative Assembly should support it. It must be known that even if this plan is still far from the national aspirations of India, it can be implemented by the majority of the people. He believes that today's plan is the only way to fulfill the national aspirations. The debate on this case will end tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Government Proposes Major Reforms to the Soviet Constitution Through the Congress <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Seeking Greater Democratization of the Electoral System</p>
<p>Workers and Peasants Enjoy Equal Political Rights</p>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet Union has today become a democratic country, at least in theory, as the Soviet Congress has unanimously passed a resolution stipulating the following three points: (1) secret ballot; (2) direct election of parliamentarians; (3) workers and peasants enjoy equal voting rights. Senior government observers predict that universal suffrage may end terror and strongly assert that they do not want to exert excessive pressure on universal suffrage. This thorough reform was proposed to the Congress by the government itself. Chairman of the Congress, Molotov, representing the Central Committee of the Communist Party, proposed amending the constitution to complete the necessary reforms. International political scholars say that the impact of liberating elections cannot yet be predicted, but this reform will in no way hinder Stalin's power. (Guomin dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Moscow – The Congress of the Soviet Federal Republic today unanimously passed a major reform plan, which is the prelude to a major reform of the Russian Constitution. After the vote, Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, addressed the public, saying that the various advantages of the parliamentary system will be adopted into the Soviet system in the future. Now that the class system has been abolished, secret ballots can be adopted. In the future, local Soviets can directly elect representatives to join the All-Union Congress and the Central Executive Committee, and both workers and peasants will have the same political rights. He hopes that the goal of universal suffrage will be achieved soon. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, today proposed to the Soviet Congress that some parts of the Soviet Constitution should be changed. After a short debate by the delegates of the Congress (Kosior and Goloded also participated in the debate), the following resolution was unanimously passed: "After Molotov reported the resolution of the February Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on certain changes to the Soviet Constitution, the Seventh Congress of Soviet Delegates discussed it and concluded that the proposal of the Central Committee of the Communist Party was completely correct and timely, and instructed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Constitution should be amended as follows: (A) In order to further democratize the electoral system, the previous incomplete, unequal, stratified, and recorded ballot elections should be changed to equal, direct, and secret ballot elections; (B) The socio-economic foundation of the Constitution should be based on the current class relations in the Soviet Union (the establishment of new socialist industries, the elimination of rich peasants, the complete victory of the collective farming system, and the recognition of socialist property as the foundation of Soviet society, etc.) for a more precise stipulation.</p>
<p>(2) It is recommended that the Central Executive Committee select personnel to organize a constitutional committee responsible for drafting constitutional amendments based on the above principles and submit them to the Congress of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union for approval.</p>
<p>(3) The next Soviet election should be carried out under the new system. When the Congress passed this resolution, there was thunderous applause that shook the roof. (TASS dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Molotov reported on the issue of constitutional amendments, saying: "The Central Committee of the Communist Party respectfully submits to the Congress of Soviet Delegates some questions about the amendment of the Soviet Constitution. The Central Committee's submission of this question was based on Stalin's suggestion (the crowd applauded). The submission of this question was due to the following reasons: First, since Lenin laid the foundation for the Soviet Constitution in 1918, the relationship between the class forces in the Soviet Union has greatly changed, especially after the principle of socialist property has won victory in urban and rural areas; Second, we are now able to thoroughly implement Soviet democracy and make corresponding changes to the electoral system. The Soviet Constitution was formed in 1923, at which time the drafting committee was chaired by Stalin. However, the situation in our country today, such as its socio-economic structure, as well as the cultural and political development of the working masses, is completely incomparable with that of 1923." (excerpt) "The Central Committee of the Party is now submitting the following questions to the Congress as necessary measures to further democratize the Soviet system: First, abolish the current indirect election law and implement direct elections for all Soviet organs (from village and town Soviets to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union), because direct elections can enhance the prestige of Soviet organs and strengthen their connection with the working masses. The highest Soviet organs will rise to a higher level. Currently, more and more capitalist countries are abandoning direct elections, and they are using the method of appointing officials to replace elections, while the Soviet Union is replacing indirect elections with direct elections. We stipulate that voters have the right to withdraw their elected representatives from any organ, and non-party organizations and groups of workers can pre-select candidates. If so, our Soviet system will take another step forward in the development of Soviet democracy.</p>
<p>Molotov then discussed the adoption of equal elections, saying: "The Soviet Constitution stipulates that workers should have more privileges than peasants in elections. The adoption of this method was because at that time, the general peasants were still small property owners, and at the same time, the rich peasants' forces in the countryside were very strong. Since the drafting of the Soviet Constitution, the situation has changed dramatically. The masses of peasants have abandoned their small private farming and joined collective farms to engage in the construction of a new socialist life. The masses of peasants have followed the workers in joining the ranks of socialist builders. The difference between workers and peasants has been widened, and the difference in their voting rights should be abolished first. Our abolition of unequal elections and the adoption of equal elections for all working masses will surely make the unity between workers and peasants closer and stronger, so the strength of the Soviet state will also increase day by day, and we will also have more success on our way to a society without classes."</p>
<p>"As for changing recorded ballots to secret ballots, this is a serious test of the connection between the Soviet government organs and the broad masses of workers. What it shows is that the source of the Soviet government's strength lies in strengthening and actively participating in the entire national administration by the masses, and increasing the masses' control over the entire national organs (whether upper or lower). As the Soviet state continues to consolidate the Soviet system, it can now fully realize all the advantages of universal direct equal and secret elections based on the Soviet system. The Soviets, in the past and today, are the foundation of our country's system. Only in today's Soviet Union can the advantages of the parliamentary system be fully realized, that is, the election of representatives of state administrative organs by all workers (as required by the Soviet Constitution) in a direct, equal, and secret manner."</p>
<p>"If so, the Soviet system should continue to develop in the following form: the district Soviets directly elected in each district, combined with the Soviet parliaments directly elected in each constitutional republic, and the All-Union Soviet Parliament. "Whether our friends or enemies, when they compare the development paths of bourgeois countries and the Soviet Union, they will be able to draw their conclusions. When our party boldly unfolds its great banner of proletarian democracy, capitalist countries will have angry predictions and cries of surprise. Therefore, we will understand the above point, and at the same time, when our friends in the camp express their new strength and trust in communism, we will also understand this point, that the leaders of capitalist countries have also realized that today's capitalism can be said to be historically hopeless. Although they speak differently, they involve the same facts, even more frankly. For example, a certain important person said, "Capitalist production methods have become a thing of the past." Another person said, "The collapse of 1929 was the collapse of the entire system," and so on. However, it is not difficult for us to imagine that the leaders of bourgeois society cannot draw correct conclusions from the above. Because the entire bourgeoisie always regards the private property of the means of production as "sacred and inviolable." All the efforts of the bourgeoisie are to use the state apparatus to protect this property. Our country's development path is completely different from this. The Soviet regime is resolutely advancing on the path of eliminating all classes and eliminating the psychological remnants of capitalism in people's minds, and has repeatedly achieved victories. The state apparatus is in the hands of the working class, and they rely on it to build a socialist society without classes. In the past, the Soviet state has used various methods to serve the Soviet people. In the future, it will surely be able to use various methods to consolidate socialist property, improve the lives of workers and peasants, and if necessary, it will also be able to use all its strength to defend our country's borders and meet the foreign enemies head-on. The strength of the principles of the Soviet state is invincible because the basis of its development lies in the increasingly broad participation of the masses in Soviet socialist construction. The questions we are discussing about the Soviet Constitution today reflect the great progress of socialism. At the same time, after the necessary amendments to the Constitution, it will surely further strengthen the Soviet regime. This power is based on the activities, consciousness, and organization of the masses in building a new society." (At the end of Mr. Molotov's speech, the audience applauded thunderously, and then the whole audience cheered.) (TASS dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Result of Debt Negotiations Breaking Down</p>
<p>No Change in Diplomatic Relations</p>
<p>Washington – After the State Department solemnly stated that the US-Russian debt negotiations had broken down and there was no hope for large orders from Soviet Russia, it announced today a major reduction in staff at the Moscow Embassy. In addition to the reduction in staff at the embassy, the consulate in Moscow will also be abolished, and all consulate staff will be withdrawn. After the indefinite suspension of US-Russian debt negotiations, President Roosevelt today refused to express his opinion in order to determine the responsibility for destroying the negotiations. President Roosevelt also did not comment on the news that he had acknowledged Soviet Russia's debt during the visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov to the United States. The United States recognized Soviet Russia immediately after President Roosevelt and Litvinov negotiated. (Guomin dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>According to the State Department, the United States is about to abolish its consulate general in Moscow and its consulates in some parts of the Soviet Union, and said that this decision should not be regarded as any change in the diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia. It is generally believed that the debt negotiations between the United States and Russia have now failed, and the consulates are like a decoration, so the State Department is abolishing them.

<p>Belgian Parliament Supports Government's Position</p>
<p>Advocates of Recognition Will Try Again</p>
<p>Brussels – The House of Representatives today, by a vote of 87 to 73, rejected the motion to restore diplomatic relations with Russia. Therefore, the suggestions of more radical members of Congress, asking the government to establish further relations with Soviet Russia, have at least suffered a setback. But the leaders of the recognition of Soviet Russia faction declared that they will unite their forces, continue their efforts, and start the struggle again, because they firmly believe that restoring relations with Russia is of great benefit to Belgium. However, the conservatives led by the Catholic Party still insist on refusing to fully recognize Soviet Russia, unless Soviet Russia abandons its revolutionary work. In particular, Soviet Russia should abandon its anti-religious movement. (Guomin dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The Belgian House of Representatives today, by a vote of 87 to 83, supported the government's attitude and rejected the proposal to restore diplomatic relations between Belgium and Russia. Before the vote, the Foreign Minister explained the government's attitude, saying that the cabinet still adheres to the position of not restoring formal relations with Soviet Russia. The government does not want to see Soviet Russia's propaganda machine set up in Brussels. Belgium did not vote on Soviet Russia's accession to the League of Nations because Belgium firmly believes that the Russian government has committed the crime of destroying Belgian industries. The government is now watching the evolution of Sovietism, but has not seen any reason to change its current attitude. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington – Government leaders in Washington were not excited by Naval Minister Osumi's statement that Japan is now building some warships that surpass those of Britain and the United States. It is said that Osumi was referring to submarines and destroyers. Government officials said that the treaty is actually valid for two more years, during which time the United States' naval power will be able to meet the provisions of the treaty. It is learned that from now on, no matter what kind of warships Japan builds, the United States will compete with it. (Guomin dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Naval Minister Osumi yesterday, in response to questions from Seiyukai's Nakajima Yatariji at the fourth subcommittee of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, replied that he can still catch up with the current second supplementary plan, but in the future, it will be necessary to build auxiliary ships. If the third supplementary plan is completed, the supplementary ships can be implemented. According to this statement, it implies that there is indeed a third supplementary plan.

<p>Defense Minister Hayashi's Reply</p>
<p>Buying the CER is a Profitable Investment</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota Answers Questions from Members</p>
<p>Tokyo – The House of Representatives held a fourth subcommittee meeting on the budget on the afternoon of the 7th. Defense Minister Hayashi stated that the military also hopes for a satisfactory relationship with China. The question and answer situation at the subcommittee meeting is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Mr. Shiozuki Manabu asked:</p>
<p>Does the Defense Minister think that today's situation is an extraordinary period?</p>
<p>Defense Minister Hayashi replied:</p>
<p>Since the Manchurian Incident, our country has shouldered a major responsibility, and is in a serious period in terms of foreign affairs. Moreover, we must fully assist in the development of (Manchukuo) in the future. Therefore, our country's defense area has expanded, so we believe that it is in an extremely serious situation. In other respects, it is influenced by external economic ideas, and it is by no means any ordinary period. Therefore, I have observed the above intentions and firmly believe that it is an extraordinary period.</p>
<p>Mr. Shiozuki asked:</p>
<p>Does China want to carry out positive work?</p>
<p>Defense Minister Hayashi replied:</p>
<p>This is a diplomatic issue, but from the perspective of East Asian peace, the military feels that it is necessary for relations with China to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Mr. Shiozuki asked:</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Far East situation, can the defense budget be reduced to the present level or more?</p>
<p>Mr. Saito Takao once raised a question at the formal meeting, roughly saying that the military department often increases the defense budget, which makes the world regard Japan as a warlike country and deepens its concept. The Defense Minister did not give any answer to the above question. We take this opportunity to hope to reveal our beliefs.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Hayashi replied:</p>
<p>Mr. Saito's question was directed to the Prime Minister, so I did not answer it. It is inappropriate to be suspected of being a warlike country because of the increased defense budget. Therefore, the military department, in view of the heavy and great responsibility of national defense, has only made the minimum request in order to complete it. (Nikkan dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Minister Hirota today had the following question and answer with Toshio Hanada (Seiyukai) regarding the CER issue at the first subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives:</p>
<p>(Hirota) The CER purchase and sale treaty will be signed in one month, and will take effect immediately after signing.</p>
<p>(Hanada) What is the basis for setting the road price at 140 million yuan?</p>
<p>(Hirota) It is a mutual assistance between the two sides, and there is no basis.</p>
<p>(Hanada) Once Russia receives the road price, is there any fear that it will use it for military preparations on the border?</p>
<p>(Hirota) Judging from the current situation in Russia, it is unlikely that this will happen.</p>
<p>(Hanada) (Manchukuo) has not been established for long. Is the purchase of the CER with such a huge sum of money a huge impact on the economy?</p>
<p>(Hirota) The CER can be said to be a profitable investment, so it is expected that there will be no loss. (Kalian dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Hitler Cancels Appointments to Focus on Research</p>
<p>German Ambassador to France Returns to His Post with New Instructions</p>
<p>Berlin – Last night, German leader Hitler announced the cancellation of appointments in the next ten days, because he needs to have important political discussions and has no time for other matters. This shows that Germany attaches great importance to the compromise reached by Britain and France in London on Sunday. As for what attitude Germany will take towards this, it seems that it has not yet reached a consensus. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led by von Neurath, still holds a friendly spirit of taking the London proposal as the basis for negotiations. The German leader also seems to welcome sincere discussions on this proposal, especially regarding the military aspect, in view of the recent widespread rumors abroad that Germany is secretly rearming. However, the opinions of the extreme National Socialists are that this proposal is mostly in conflict with the party's program, so there is a lot of criticism. The German ambassador to France, Köster, has now set off to return to his post, carrying a note to the French government asking for clarification on the various points in the proposal.

<p>A report from Warsaw, by the semi-official Polish Daily, containing dispatches from London and Berlin, expresses considerable doubt about the future success of the international negotiations planned at the recent Anglo-French London conference. The London dispatch states that the British view has gone further than the Eastern European Pact, and aims not to encircle Germany but to induce it to rejoin the League of Nations. The dispatch further states that the London talks are merely the beginning of lengthy and difficult international negotiations, with France insisting on guarantees and Germany demanding equal rights. Britain hopes for successful disarmament, making mediation between the three difficult. The Berlin dispatch is even more pessimistic, stating that although the London conference has begun, the time when all relevant countries can gather at a round table is still far off. Furthermore, in the current situation, war may not be imminent, but the continuation of the arms race is to be expected. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>London - According to usually reliable financial sources today, Premier Flandin hinted during his visit to London last week that France might seek loans from Britain. It is said that after the French Premier's suggestion to stabilize currency at an early date was rejected by financial circles and the Bank of England, he secretly informed the British authorities of this intention. It is recalled that the French government recently increased its short-term public debt from 10,000,000,000 francs to 15,000,000,000 francs. During Flandin's visit to London and negotiations on the Anglo-French agreement, he met with British government financial advisor, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and banker Blumenthal. It is now known that although Flandin did not explicitly request Britain to lift the ban on foreign loans, he indicated that France might seek loans from abroad to address its immediate needs. It is also learned that France will formally contact Britain and the Netherlands regarding this matter. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Opposing Political Views</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary - Internal discord has broken out within the National Unity Party (the ruling party), and has now reached an acute stage. The party has split into two factions: one supporting Prime Minister Gömbös, and the other led by former Prime Minister Bethlen. The two factions hold divergent views on both domestic and foreign policy. For example, regarding the revision of Hungary's borders, both factions acknowledge its necessity, but General Gömbös advocates raising the issue in future international negotiations, while Bethlen believes that the time is not yet ripe. As for domestic policy, Bethlen strongly opposes Gömbös' proposed land reform and electoral reform bills. The key to the political situation now lies in the hands of Regent Horthy, as he has the power to dissolve parliament. In short, the infighting between the two factions within the ruling party is intensifying daily. One faction uses "Supporting Gömbös" as its slogan, while the Bethlen faction opposes him, claiming that Gömbös' actions have dangerous National Socialist tendencies. The outcome remains to be seen.

<p>Washington - The House of Representatives today unanimously approved the report on Representative McSwain's bill to control wartime profits. Washington believes this move is particularly noteworthy coming after the Senate Munitions Investigating Committee caused international conflicts. American Federation of Labor officials have supported the bill from the start, arguing that since the people have an obligation to serve in the military, industrial machinery and financial organizations should have the same obligation. Others see the Committee's actions as an attempt to clarify its position, which may not be entirely consistent with the War Department's plans released during the munitions investigation. Senator Nye, chairman of the Munitions Investigating Committee, claimed that munitions dealers were found to have made profits as high as 300%, and that during the European War, 181 Americans had incomes exceeding one million dollars each. Many foreign officials, identified by witnesses, protested the release of testimony and criticized the Committee's actions. However, the Investigating Committee's mission is not yet complete. With McSwain's proposal, further government action is expected based on the evidence collected by the Munitions Investigating Committee. The alleged conflict with the War Department's plans is limited to theoretical aspects, but officials who testified at previous committee investigation meetings stated that the War Department cooperated with munitions dealers to increase the development of the munitions industry without using government funds. Nye claimed that munitions dealers, driven by profit, directly or indirectly provoke international conflict. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Preparing to Declare a State of Emergency</p>
<p>Seeking Legislative Remedy</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding the question of whether the abolition of the gold clause is valid, all parties are now awaiting the Supreme Court's decision. As a result, public opinion is quite hesitant. On the other hand, President Roosevelt continues to pursue his policy of economic centralization and rationalization. On the surface, if the Supreme Court's decision is unfavorable to the government and greatly weakens government authority, President Roosevelt will be constrained. Some bills that would face resistance before passage may not even be introduced. However, government officials have repeatedly stated that, if necessary, they are prepared to declare a state of emergency to remedy the consequences of the abolition of the gold clause. This attitude of the government has attracted much attention. The government may believe that only bold action is the best policy. Representative Rayburn, Chairman of the House Commerce Committee, has introduced a bill advocating government control of all public utilities, prohibiting monopolies, regulating gas and electricity businesses, and regulating domestic and foreign enterprises.

<p>Labour Party Wins</p>
<p>Conservative Party Attaches Great Importance</p>
<p>London - A by-election for a seat in the House of Commons was held today in the Wirral constituency of Liverpool, England. There were four candidates: Labour's Cleary, the National Conservative Party's Platt, the Independent Conservative Churchill, and the Liberal Party's Marris. The Labour candidate won, receiving 15,611 votes. Newspapers commented on the event, calling it a major blow to the government. The division within the Conservative Party led to the Labour victory. The Independent Conservative Churchill is the son of the well-known politician Winston Churchill. He not only opposes the Indian Constitution Bill, but also criticizes the government's general policies. He received 10,575 votes. If Churchill had not formed his own party, the National Conservative Platt would have received more than 13,771 votes and could have defeated the Labour Party. This result will not only encourage the opposition to the Indian Constitution Bill, but also carries the possibility of Independent Conservatives interfering in other by-elections. Therefore, the Conservative Party attaches great importance to this matter. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Paris - The world's beautiful capital, Paris, experienced another tragedy today. A similar event occurred one year ago. More than 1,200 Communists were arrested, reportedly carrying pistols, bayonets, and oil-soaked rags. There were five injured. Police predicted that riots would continue. As of recently, there have been no reports of fatalities. Armed mounted police dispersed crowds attempting to storm the Presidential Palace and arrested 40 rioters. Police reports stated that rioters arrested outside the Presidential Palace were carrying guns, knives and clubs. The large demonstration took place near the Concorde Triangle area of Saint-Lazare. After receiving telegrams that Communist leaders were brewing a demonstration, officials mobilized reserves this morning. It is said that fortunately for this telegram, the incident was able to be quelled. Although today's events were very serious, they were far from comparable to last year's riots, in which many people were killed and injured. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

Yesterday, 1,200 people were arrested, including many Communists carrying pistols. It is reported that they fired shots at the police near a church, but fortunately no one was injured. (Reuters Telegram, 7th) Paris - Yesterday marked the anniversary of last year's disturbances in Paris. The morning was quiet, but around midnight, a large number of Communist demonstrators, arriving by train, car and tram from various towns and villages near Paris, gathered in the Place de la Concorde. Around the Saint-Lazare station and Place de la Concorde, 565 people were arrested by the authorities. Most of them were carrying weapons, clubs and rags soaked in gasoline. At around 1 a.m., another 40 Communists were arrested near the Presidential Palace, mostly carrying pistols and knives. By 1:30 a.m., the total number of people arrested was 1,200. Last night, a large number of young patriots came to participate in the memorial service and cheered for Chiappe, the police chief who was dismissed last year, who also attended the meeting. Afterwards, they formed a line and marched to the Arc de Triomphe, placing flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and then made speeches using moderate language. The flowers placed at the Place de la Concorde yesterday morning were moved by the police chief to the cemetery where those who died last year were buried together. In short, yesterday's memorial passed peacefully in Paris and various provinces, with no incidents occurring. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - The French government implemented revised tariffs on cotton yarn and cotton products in Syria, its mandated territory, on November 21 of last year. Japan is effectively subjected to unequal trade treatment as a result. Reports indicate that the French government had already hinted at this intention, as Japan's effective date of withdrawal from the League of Nations is approaching, and Japan will become a non-League nation after March 27. Therefore, France is exercising discriminatory trade treatment against Japan. The Foreign Ministry ordered Ambassador Sato in France to negotiate with the French government regarding the revised tariff plan. Now that this situation exists, there is no shortage of merchants strongly demanding that measures be taken. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry recently requested the French government to seriously reconsider. (Japanese Union Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>London - During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP MacDonagh asked the government to continue to consider placing guards on all ships, large and small, traveling in Chinese waters frequented by pirates, for the safety of travelers. He also asked whether protecting British ships in Chinese waters was the responsibility of the British Navy, and why shipping companies were not required to provide adequate guards on all their ships. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Bolton Eyres Monsell, replied that the British naval authorities in China are making every effort to ensure that British shipping companies provide adequate guards on all ships traveling along the Chinese coast. There is a difference between British ships sailing on the high seas and those sailing on inland waters. Those sailing on the Yangtze River are provided with guards by the British authorities, while those sailing on the high seas, such as the Tongzhou ships, are guarded by the shipping companies themselves. However, in special circumstances, naval guards are also provided by us. MacDonagh also asked whether the British Navy often goes to the rescue when British ships are attacked by pirates. The First Lord replied in the affirmative. The First Lord continued to say that after receiving detailed reports of the piracy on the Tongzhou, the circumstances of the Tongzhou's misfortune will be thoroughly investigated in London. Conservative MP Lord Apsley also asked Foreign Secretary Simon whether he should suggest to the Chinese government to negotiate a joint effort to suppress piracy in Chinese waters. Simon replied that the British Navy in China is already taking joint action with the Chinese army and navy, and this cooperation has been effective. Given the close relationship between the Chinese and British navies and their cooperation, I believe that the government does not need to take further action. The Foreign Secretary also answered another question from Conservative MP Knox, saying that according to a telegram from Nanjing on December 27 of last year, the danger of bandit-communist activity in the Yangtze River area between Hankou and Nanjing has been eliminated, so the safety of ships and passengers is no longer a concern. However, the British Consul and naval authorities will continue to pay attention to the overall situation. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Xi'an - Yang Hucheng went to southern Shaanxi last year to inspect defenses. In mid-January, he went to Zhen'an and Shangxian to oversee the suppression of the Xu Haidong bandits and to rectify the discipline of the bandit suppression troops. After overseeing his troops, he defeated the Xu bandits. Only over a thousand bandits remain, and they have now fled to the Baihe and Yunxi areas on the border between Hubei and Shaanxi. Yang believed that the bandit suppression had come to an end, and ordered three brigade commanders, Liu Yanbiao, Zhang Hongyuan, and Tang Sitong, to be responsible for continuing the suppression. As he had been away from the province for a long time and military affairs urgently needed to be handled, he departed from the Shangxian headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 6th and returned to Xi'an. People from all walks of life came to the suburbs to welcome him. According to Yang, the defenses in southern Shaanxi have been properly arranged during his two-month absence from the province. Most of the Xu bandits have been defeated by us, and the Shaanxi army and Xiao Zhichu's troops are continuing to clear them out, which will happen soon. The bandit suppression in southern Shaanxi has been successful. Sun Weiru is now in charge, commanding everything. The Shaanxi army has entered Sichuan to assist in the suppression, and the counties of Wanyuan and Chengkou will soon be recovered. There are no longer any traces of bandits in northeastern Sichuan. The Shaanxi army has a specific plan for entering Sichuan. The bandits near Guangyuan, Raoning and Qiang were defeated by us. The Shaanxi army has established contact with Hu Zongnan, Xiao Zhichu and other troops, and is determined to jointly suppress the Red bandits in northern Sichuan. (Central Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Nanjing - Representatives from the fir and cedar wood industry in the upper reaches of the Min River, Chen Xinyuan and others, came to Nanjing to petition, saying that the timber production in Fujian Province is only worth over 3 million yuan annually, while various taxes amount to 1 million yuan. On the waterway between Yanping and Fuzhou alone, which is hundreds of miles long, there are already more than 40 kinds of taxes. This restricts the sales of domestic timber and increases the import of foreign timber. The industry formed a petition group to request the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to order Fujian Province to abolish the excessive timber taxes. Approval was granted to order Fujian Province to abolish the excessive timber taxes, and the Ministry of Finance dispatched Wang Guanghui to Fujian to investigate. (Special Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported that a special correspondent in New York sent a cable stating that the American student peace theory test vote, jointly initiated by the weekly magazine Literary Review and the University News Editors Association, was held to understand the psychology of American students regarding the current world situation. Among the 32,500 votes received, the majority supported peace. The content is as follows: (1) Does the United States face the possibility of being drawn into the vortex of war in the future? As a result, 20,154 votes believed there was a possibility of being drawn in, while 9,731 votes opposed. (2) If the United States is invaded by other countries, would you be willing to take up arms and fight? 24,291 votes supported resistance, while 5,408 votes opposed resistance. (3) What are your thoughts on the United States invading other countries? 24,508 votes advocated not invading other countries, while 4,982 votes supported it. (4) Is the doctrine of the United States Navy and Air Force reaching the world's leading position a sound policy for preventing participation in war? 9,931 votes supported it, while 20,031 votes opposed it. (5) Can the United States join the League of Nations? 15,731 votes supported it, while 14,072 votes opposed it. From the above, it can be seen that in this test of American students' psychology towards war and peace, the opposition to the doctrine of the United States Navy and Air Force being the world's leading power was at a ratio of two to one, which clearly shows the peace-loving nature of American youth.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Jiangxi Province Military Rice Transferred to Regulate Civilian Food Supply <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Purchased by the Provincial Government with Prepared Funds</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence: During the tense period of the suppression of the Red Army in Jiangxi Province, the armies that joined the battle sequence, in the east, west, north, and south, numbered no fewer than [blank] tens of thousands of people. Therefore, the Logistics Office of the Campaign Headquarters made full preparations in advance for military food, purchasing it in various places where rice prices were lower. Grain reserves were extremely abundant in the military centers. Now that the suppression of the Red Army has concluded, the battle sequence has been dissolved, and a portion of the armies have entered Hunan, Guizhou, and Sichuan to continue the suppression. The cities of Ji'an and Nancheng have dispatched 120,000 dan of military rice. The local authorities in the province have decided to purchase this military rice with prepared funds and transport it to the most food-scarce drought and bandit-stricken areas to regulate the civilian food supply. After the bandit disaster in the 7th year of the Republic, coupled with the unprecedented drought last year, the harvest of early and late rice crops was less than half of normal, creating a famine-like scene not seen in fifty years. A survey of civilian food in various places by the Civil Affairs Department shows that the majority of people are short of food for more than four months, and in counties such as Ruichang, Hukou, and Xingzi in northern Jiangxi, even grass roots and tree bark have been exhausted. A large-scale and comprehensive relief effort is necessary to avert a catastrophe. Therefore, the Civil Affairs Department and the Finance Department have prepared funds to purchase and transport this 120,000 dan of foreign rice to famine areas as the first step. The second step will be to manage grain price regulation at the time when the old harvest has been consumed and new crops are still growing, using the accumulated grain from various places that was organized last year. It is reported that the Jiangxi Office of the Economic Commission and the Rural Cooperative Association will use a portion of the cooperative funds for grain transportation and marketing cooperation. In addition, the first batch of 20,000 bags of relief rice from the Shanghai Red Swastika Society's drought relief effort has been transported to Jiujiang and is being inspected and released by Li Dixian and others.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Xiamen to Establish Municipal Government <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Political Council Orders Provincial Government to Investigate and Report</p>
<p>Civil Affairs Department Has Already Prepared the Municipal Government Organization</p>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: Xiamen is one of the earliest five treaty ports. Its commercial and economic status in South China ranks third, only after Guangzhou and Shantou. The total value of customs trade reaches more than 30 million yuan per year, with tax revenue of more than 4 million yuan. Therefore, the proposal to establish a municipal government has been around for a long time. However, the reason why it has not been realized is that the ordinary city establishment in the National Government's city organization law requires a population of more than 200,000, and the total amount of business tax, license fees, and land tax collected annually accounts for more than one-half of the total income of the area. However, the population of Xiamen City is more than 170,000, which is less than 200,000, and the revenue from business licenses, land, and other taxes is not large. Therefore, the establishment of a municipal government cannot be financially self-sufficient. Therefore, during the period when Yang Shuzhuang governed Fujian, the matter was repeatedly discussed but not completed. When the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, it decided to establish a city and had already established the (Siming Municipal Government Preparatory Office). It was planned to merge Siming County and rename the entire island of Xiamen as Siming Municipal Government. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan submitted the matter to the Navy, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. After deliberation by the three ministries, for diplomatic and national defense reasons, Heshan was still under the Siming County Government as an inland area. Only the urban area under the jurisdiction of the current Xiamen Public Security Bureau was established as a municipal government. The matter was not realized and the Fujian Incident occurred, so it was not carried out. After the Central Army recovered Xiamen, the provincial government felt that there was a definite need for unified administration in terms of internal affairs and foreign affairs, and the matter was indeed beyond the scope of what a county government could encompass. Therefore, the (Xiamen Special Public Security Bureau) was established in the Xiamen urban area, and Wang Gupan was appointed as the director, which was a transformed municipal government. The Siming County Government still existed, and Wang concurrently served as the county magistrate, so as to unify local administrative power. Later, the provincial government submitted the case of establishing the (Xiamen Special Public Security Bureau) to the Executive Yuan. After discussion at the Executive Council, it was decided that the whole country only had Weihaiwei, which had recovered a concession and established a special public security bureau. Since Xiamen did not have any special circumstances, it was impossible to establish a special public security bureau. As a result, the application was rejected. Last winter, Wang Gupan personally went to Nanjing to explain the situation to the central government and requested to resign. The central government retained him and ordered him to return to his post. At the same time, the provincial government submitted the proposal for the establishment of a municipal government to the Executive Yuan again. The Executive Yuan approved the order for the provincial government to investigate the situation in Xiamen and submit a report for review. The provincial government held two meetings at the end of the year and discussed this matter for a long time, ordering the Civil Affairs Department to handle it. The Civil Affairs Department has already prepared the organization, established a municipal government, and established one bureau and three sections, namely: (1) the Public Security Bureau; (2) the First Section, managing matters related to opium suppression, sanitation, charity, land, autonomy, and ethics and education; (3) the Second Section, managing matters related to finance, public property, public operations, food, and other matters; and (4) the Third Section, managing matters related to public utilities, construction, transportation, industry, and education. After the proposal is submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval, it can be reported to the Executive Yuan. The date of Xiamen's establishment as a city should not be far away.

<h3 id="e99">Guangxi Province Reorganizes Civilian Fire Protection <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Each County and City Organizes a Civilian Fire Protection Association</p>
<p>Civilians Have the Responsibility of Voluntary Firefighting</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Guangxi Province's civilian defense training has achieved considerable results. Recently, since civilian fire protection and air defense construction have a great relationship, the Guangxi Construction Committee has specially proposed the establishment of the Guangxi Civilian Fire Protection Committee. It has prepared general rules and survey forms for government-run and private fire protection, and submitted them to the Guangxi Provincial Government for approval. Yesterday, orders have been issued to various counties and cities for separate compliance. The attached organizational general rules are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: Each city and county, for the purpose of eliminating fires, should organize a civilian fire protection committee (hereinafter referred to as the Fire Protection Committee) to handle civilian fire protection matters under the direction of the local competent authorities (such as the Public Security Bureau, County Government, District, Township, and Town Office, etc.). Article 2: Each Fire Protection Committee should be named after the local place. Article 3: The Fire Protection Association shall have five to nine members, with one to three members appointed by the local competent authority, and the remainder elected by the representatives of all sectors. The term of office for elected members is one year, and they may be re-elected. Article 4: The Fire Protection Association shall have one to three standing committee members, one of whom shall be elected by the appointed members, and if there are three, one shall be elected by the appointed members and two by the elected members. Article 5: The Fire Protection Committee shall appoint several fire squad leaders and drivers, and their number shall be determined according to local conditions and the complexity of affairs. Article 6: Each fire squad shall have several members, who shall be selected by the committee from the able-bodied men over the age of eighteen and under the age of fifty residing in the area on a rotational basis, and appointed by the competent authority for a term of one year. They shall have the responsibility of voluntary firefighting. In the event of a fire alarm, they must quickly go to their respective squad to assemble and, led by the squad leader, rush to the disaster site to put out the fire. Article 7: The squad leader and driver may be given an appropriate allowance by the committee's resolution. Article 8: The methods for raising funds for civilian fire protection shall be formulated by the Fire Protection Association and submitted to the local competent authority for review and approval, and then submitted to the government at each level for approval before they can be implemented. Article 9: The existing civilian fire protection organizations in each city and county shall be reorganized in accordance with these general rules. Article 10: The detailed rules for the operation of the Fire Protection Association should be formulated by the committee and reported to the local competent authority for review and approval, and then submitted to the provincial government at each level for review and filing. Article 11: These general rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (February 2)</p>
<h3 id="e100">General Situation of Changting Papermaking <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Annual production of over 20,000 piculs, ranking first among local products</p>
<p>Establishment of a Publicly Operated Paper Company for Continued Operation</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: Western Fujian is a paper-producing region. Before the lifting of the maritime ban, its products such as (Lianshi) paper were sold throughout the country, especially Changting. Most of the paper produced in Changting was exported to Chaoshan via the Han River. Although Western paper has become popular in recent years, there is still a considerable demand for domestic paper such as Lianshi and Maobian. Therefore, the production volume is still abundant, ranking first among Changting's local products. After Changting fell to the bandits, in November of the 22nd year [of the Republic], the Zhonghua Commercial Company of the pseudo-Central Government in Ruijin specially organized a paper company, appointing a person from Xingguo as manager, with a capital of 200,000 yuan. They once smuggled a part of their products through the Tinghang blockade line of the pseudo-Commercial Company and transported them to Chaoshan for sale, making considerable profits. After the National Army recovered Changting, this bandit property was investigated and confiscated, and the third temporary meeting of the Post-War Relief Committee resolved to establish a (Publicly Operated Paper Company). Currently, the company's address is located at the Fan Family Ancestral Hall on Zhongzheng Road in Changting, and it officially opened for business on December 21. According to the person in charge of the company, the detailed accounts of the former pseudo-paper company have all been lost, and the amounts of paper for each trough cannot be verified. However, there are still vouchers for each trough, which are temporarily used as a basis. The paper production area also covers the territory of Jiangxi Province, including Tailai, Ridong, Yangdi, and Taoyang in Jiangxi, and Guanqianjia, Liangfang, Sibu, Dongpo Zhangdi, Changning, Zhenhua, and Qigushuxia in Fujian, totaling twelve areas with two hundred and thirty-eight troughs. Among the areas, Changning has the most paper troughs, with twenty-four troughs, producing more than 9,000 piculs annually. In total, the capital of each trough was about 100,000 yuan during the former pseudo-paper company, and the paper production was more than 20,000 piculs. After the establishment and registration of the publicly operated paper company, areas such as Zhangdi have come to register, totaling more than 9,000 piculs. The Changning area has also been surveyed. Other areas are temporarily suspended due to unsettled local conditions. About 300 piculs of paper have been paid, and they are currently stored and not yet sold. (February 6)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Communication: Guangdong Province has recently been vigorously rectifying land administration. The authorities previously dispatched a large number of farmland surveyors to various counties to conduct farmland surveys. After the farmland surveys are completed, additional personnel will be sent to conduct spot checks and assess the farmland prices in each county. After the assessment, the value per mu varies, sometimes sixty yuan, sometimes thirty yuan, depending on the fertility of the land and the amount of output in each county. After assessing the land prices, land tax will be collected. According to the survey, the total farmland in Guangdong accounts for 7.5% of the province's land area. The number of mu of farmland in each county is as follows (all units are in mu): Zhongshan 2,254,700, Panyu 1,516,300, Nanhai 1,491,000, Dongguan 1,848,800, Huiyang 1,463,900, Shunde 1,081,700, Gaoyao 1,063,600, Taishan 857,600, Boluo 686,300, Qingyuan 644,000, Qin County 627,500, Qujiang 606,200, Chaoyang 534,800, Lufeng 522,200, Xinyu 410,500, Yangjiang 402,500, Meixian 380,200, Huaxian 356,000, Heyuan 351,400, Kaiping 346,800, Xinhui 1,245,100, Qiongshan 1,086,000, Suixi 892,000, Wenchang 850,300, Nanxiong 671,500, Yingde 639,200, Chao'an 622,600, Sanshui 602,200, Maoming 525,200, Lian County 519,400, Hepu 408,500, Lianjiang 394,600, Dan County 364,000, Luoding 354,000, Sihui 48,800, Haikang 344,800, Zengcheng 824, Haifeng 743,900, Huaxian 496,200, Yangshan 318,000, Nanhai 313,300, Raoping 434,000, Qiongdong 200,000, Deqing 336,000, Gaoming 322,3000, Chengmai 107,400, Wanning 94,300, Zijin 308,800, Bao'an 288,000, Yaxian 261,500, Yangyang 777,100, Yangchun 322,300, Chenghai 317,500, Heshan 308,900, Chao'an 451,300, Lingao 245,200, Shixing 205,500, Xuwen 197,800, Longmen 322, Jiaoling 111,100, Kaijian 92,200, Xingning 86,200, Guangning 302,900, Yunfu 288,000, Xinyi 258,200, Renji 194,700, Fengchuan 182,500, Lianping 155,500, Puning 153,800, Pingyuan 145,600, Xinfeng 134,900, Ruyuan 153,100, Wuhua 139,600, Lingshui 68,400, Donghui 59,400, Lianshan 54,200, Chixi 43,600, Gan'en 37,600, Wengyuan 252,000, Yanshan 218,900, Fengshun 133,800, Fogang 113,400, Nanao 9,700, Wuchuan 2,200, Dabu 111,400, Longchuan 122,400, Heping 246,000, Dinghua 224,200, Dianbai 19,400, Fangcheng 28,000.

<p>Yesterday (6th) morning at 10:00 AM, spring snow suddenly fell in this city, pressing on the high-voltage wires of electric lights and touching the telephone lines. The current spread, and for a while, the telephones in the households suddenly heard a long ringing that lasted for dozens of minutes. At the telephone company's switchboard, dozens of number plates suddenly emitted smoke, filling the machine room. The company authorities, realizing there was a problem, immediately telegraphed the electric light company to temporarily close the power supply switches on all lines to check for damage and carry out repairs. However, the electric light company did not grant the request, and all the number plates of the telephone switchboard were smoking, indicating a serious situation. The telephone company, fearing the risk of electric shock to users, cut the telephone main line to prevent the current. The company then informed the users, temporarily suspending calls, and dispatched workers to repair the damage in all directions. It is feared that it will not be completed in three or four days.</p>

<p>Zhao Desan's family, farmers of Yanlou Township, District 1, about three miles outside the South Gate of this city, were suddenly visited by more than a dozen thieves speaking the local dialect around 12:00 PM the night before last. Because there were many people in the house, they all came out to resist the thieves, so the thieves did not have time to plunder, only stealing a gold ring and dozens of beads before escaping. Zhao's nephew, Zhang Fu, was courageous and went out to pursue the fleeing thieves. After walking about half a li, he caught a thief and fought him empty-handed, but was shot in the left forehead by the thief and immediately fell to the ground and died. Upon receiving the report, County Magistrate Yuan immediately ordered the police to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice. He also personally wrote the four characters "Sacrifice Life for Righteousness," added a postscript, and presented it as a commendation.</p>

<p>Since the failure of the silk factory industry in this county, all industries have been affected, and business has plummeted, causing great depression in society. During this period of major closure, the number of industries that have closed down or been consolidated is unknown. It is learned that the Gongshun Pawnshop in Yingqiao Lane and the Chunhua Pawnshop in Huangni Village outside the South Gate, both owned by Sheng Yifan of Changzhou, have been in operation for several decades. In recent years, due to sluggish business and financial difficulties, they announced their closure from the previous day, only redeeming items and not accepting new ones, until the end of this year. Yesterday, a special report was submitted to the county government for record.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Investigation of Rice and Paddy Stored in Warehouses <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Last year, the early rice disaster caused a poor harvest of rice and grain. However, the stocks in various warehouses in this county have not decreased. The reason is that the rural economy is exhausted. Once the rice and paddy are harvested, they are immediately transported to the market for sale, exchanged for cash, or used by merchants to deposit in warehouses for loans. The reporter has investigated the rice and grain stored in 26 warehouses in this county (excluding four warehouses in the Southern District that were not included in the investigation) as follows, to inform those who care about people's food: 524,950 piculs of Geng rice, 483,270 piculs of Xian rice, 163,240 piculs of Yuan rice, 100,258 shi of manufactured Geng rice, 49,714 shi of manufactured Xian rice, 11,500 shi of manufactured Yuan rice, 34,560 shi of white Xian rice, 270 shi of white Geng rice, 2,140 shi of white Yuan rice, 394,600 shi of soybeans, 64,540 shi of mung beans, 133,160 bags of wheat, 69,110 piculs of barley, 16,380 shi of Yuan wheat, 900 piculs of wild rice, 1,460 shi of Saigon rice, 19,600 shi of sorghum, 14,800 shi of sesame, 3,730 shi of corn, 230 shi of broad beans, 1,200 shi of red beans.</p>

<p>Wang Yuanji Foundry in Yanqiao Town in this county and Tong Yuanji Foundry in Xicangqiao, Changzhou, are affiliated, owned by the same owner, and have distribution points in Wuxi, Changzhou, Nantong and other counties. Wang Yuanji North Warehouse, the Nantong distribution point, long-term hired Tang Jikang's sampan to transport iron pots and other goods between Changzhou and Nantong for sale, transporting more than ten times a year. When returning from Nantong to Wuxi and Changzhou, the sampan also transported cotton and other sundries to maintain expenses. Tang Jikang and his son had been transporting iron pots for the two foundries for decades and were very careful, greatly trusted by the foundry owner. On the first of this month, the sampan loaded with iron pots from Wuxi and Changzhou set off from Wuxi to Nantong. The next morning, while sailing on the river near Jiangyin, it suddenly encountered the Qingning steamer of Shanghai Zhongning Company (some say Huaxing) heading to Pukou, which came from behind. The sampan was unable to avoid it in time, and the stern of the sampan was hit and broken into two sections. All five people on board were unable to escape. The Qingning steamer, realizing it had caused an accident, sped away without rescuing the people. Later, another ship passed by and complained greatly, issuing an alarm for help. The Qingning steamer then began to rescue the people. At that time, three people were rescued, but Tang Jikang and another person were drowned. The people on the Qingning steamer forced the three rescued people to sign a document, the purpose of which is unknown. After the incident, the survivors went to Jiangyin and then to Wuxi to report to Sun Boying and Yu Daiqing, the managers of Wuxi and Changzhou, who entrusted lawyer Yun Kuyao, their perennial legal counsel, to send a letter to the Shanghai Collision Ship Committee and lodge a serious protest with the Zhongning Company. The total loss is estimated at five or six thousand yuan, and two people drowned, which is truly tragic.</p>

<p>After the major closure of businesses in Xiaoshan County, the most profitable industries were the sauce industry and the tofu industry, followed by the money industry, and then the southern goods industry and the rice industry. The oil and candle industry, grocery industry, foreign and Guang goods, calico industry, pastry industry, and cured meat industry were average. The copper and tin industry and the woodenware industry were unprofitable. Due to years of famine, people simplified everything related to weddings, so those who were usually well-off reduced their expenses by more than half last winter, resulting in an abnormal decline in business. The remaining restaurants and dim sum shops were also unprofitable due to account problems.</p>

<p>Signed yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Shanghai Telephone Bureau</p>
<p>Effective for a period of five years upon signing</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Transportation, considering that the previous long-distance connection contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company had expired, and to facilitate long-distance telephone calls for citizens in the concession areas, as well as to develop domestic and international long-distance telephone business, deemed it urgent to renew the contract for compliance. It is heard that the Ministry of Transportation, the Telephone Bureau, and the Company have consulted repeatedly and finalized the contract, which was approved by the Ministry of Transportation. On the morning of the 7th, at 10:00 AM, the manager of the Shanghai Telephone Company, a Westerner named Baud, along with Vice President Tan Xuewei, went to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to formally sign the contract with the Bureau Director Xu Xueyu and German engineer Yu Bingjian. It is also heard that both parties will increase the number of long-distance relay lines within days, and will also open telephone access to various locations in the concession areas that are currently unable to connect, to facilitate communication. The original text of the contract is excerpted below:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Long-Distance Telephone Connection Contract <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>This contract is made on the 7th day of February in the 24th year of the Republic of China, corresponding to the 7th day of February in the year 1935 of the Western calendar, between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation of the Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as "the Bureau," and as Party A) and the Shanghai Telephone Company, registered in the State of Delaware, USA, located at 232 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai, China (hereinafter referred to as "the Company," and as Party B). It is understood that the Bureau currently operates the local telephone service in Shanghai and can connect with the Ministry of Transportation's current and future domestic and international wired and wireless long-distance telephone services (hereinafter collectively referred to as "the Bureau's Lines"). The Company currently operates the local telephone service within the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession. Both parties believe that connecting with each other to exchange long-distance telephone calls, in accordance with the conditions outlined in this contract, will undoubtedly promote the interests of both parties and the public. Both parties, therefore, agree to enter into the following contract: 1. The Company's Lines shall connect with the Bureau's Lines at the boundary of Zhabei. The Company is responsible for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the lines from the long-distance station in the concession area to the boundary of Zhabei. The Bureau is responsible for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the lines from the long-distance station in Zhabei to the boundary of Zhabei. 2. Each party shall establish and maintain appropriate operational procedures to ensure that users of both parties can have rapid and direct communication with each other. 3.

However, neither party shall be liable to the other for any damages arising from line obstructions or interruptions, regardless of the cause or duration of such obstructions or interruptions. Should such obstructions or interruptions occur, the Bureau and the Company shall make every effort to repair them within the shortest possible time. 5. The telephone charges for all calls shall be collected in accordance with the tariffs prescribed by the Ministry of Transportation as notified by the Bureau from time to time. Except for the appropriate special delivery fees that may be charged when it is necessary to dispatch a special messenger to notify the recipient, neither party may collect any other fees. The Bureau shall be responsible for notifying the Company of the tariffs prescribed by the Ministry of Transportation at least thirty days before the implementation of such tariffs. Except for necessary official calls between the Bureau and the Company, there shall be no free calls or discounts on telephone charges. All other calls shall still be calculated according to the prescribed tariffs. If the tariffs are not calculated in Chinese national currency, the Bureau shall notify the Company of the exchange rate for the month on the first day of each month so that the Company can collect fees from its users in Chinese national currency. 6. All incoming and outgoing telephone charges shall belong to the Bureau. The remuneration paid to the Company is as follows: A. For each long-distance telephone call (including notification fee) originated by the Company to the Bureau, the Company shall receive 10% of the total call charge or notification fee as a handling fee for originating the call, but the minimum handling fee shall not be less than five Chinese national currency cents, and the maximum shall not exceed one Chinese national currency dollar and fifty cents. B. For each long-distance telephone call (including notification fee) originated by the Bureau to the Company, the Company shall receive 5% of the total call charge or notification fee as a handling fee for terminating the call, but the minimum handling fee shall not be less than five Chinese national currency cents, and the maximum shall not exceed one Chinese national currency dollar and fifty cents. 7. For all telephone charges originating from one party to the other, both parties shall collect the charges from their own users and shall be fully responsible for the accounts and liabilities owed to the other party. Each party shall keep separate records of all items handled, and the other party may inspect these records and documents at any reasonable time. Each party shall prepare a monthly report on the telephone charges for the month and submit it to the other party by the end of the following month at the latest. This monthly report shall contain all items agreed upon by both parties from time to time. 8. If the party receiving a monthly report does not raise any written objections within one month after the monthly report is prepared and sent by one party to the other, it shall be deemed to have been acknowledged. The net difference between the telephone charges issued by both parties shall be paid by the paying party no later than the end of the second month following the month of the telephone call. 9. If the Company or the Bureau fails to pay any amount due in accordance with this contract, and fails to pay within thirty days after the other party submits a written notice to its head office, the other party may terminate this contract immediately by written notice to the head office of that party. 10. The failure of either party to comply with or implement, or the failure of the other party to insist on compliance with any provision of this contract, or the waiver by either party of any provision of this contract under any circumstances, shall not be deemed to be a joint abandonment of such provision. Such provision shall always retain its full force and effect. 11. If the parties cannot agree on the implementation of any provision of this contract, the matter shall be submitted to an arbitration committee. One party shall notify the other party in writing of the name of the arbitrator it has selected and inquire about the arbitrator selected by the other party. Within ten days of receiving the written notice, the other party shall inform the first party of the name of its arbitrator, and the arbitrators appointed by both parties shall jointly select a third arbitrator. If the two arbitrators are unable to agree on the selection of a third arbitrator after twenty days, both parties shall request the non-American head of the Shanghai Consular Body to appoint one. Both parties shall abide by the decision of the arbitrators. The arbitration costs shall be handled in accordance with the method determined by the arbitrators. 12. Without the written permission of the other party, neither party may transfer or assign this contract or any rights contained therein.

After five years, it may not be terminated unless either party gives six months' prior written notice. 14. This contract is written in Chinese and is accompanied by an English translation agreed to by both parties. Both parties shall perform this contract after signing. This contract is signed and implemented by both parties on the 7th day of February in the 24th year of the Republic of China, corresponding to the 7th day of February in the year 1935 of the Western calendar, in the presence of witnesses.

<h3 id="e129">The Stolen and Robbed Tongzhou Steamer Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Shandong Steamer, Which Transferred Passengers, Also Arrives</p>
<p>Crew Members Describe in Detail the Circumstances of the Robbery</p>
<p>The British-owned Taikoo Company's Northern Seas route Tongzhou steamer, which departed from Shanghai for Yantai and Tianjin on the 28th of last month, was infiltrated by pirates who hijacked the ship outside the Wusongkou. The steamer entered the port at 6:50 AM yesterday and docked at 8:00 AM. A reporter from this newspaper visited the ship yesterday to interview the crew members. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Two Steamers Arrive Together <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>When the Tongzhou steamer entered the port yesterday morning, it anchored at Wusongkou. Taikoo's manager, Laimu, notified the Customs, the Water Police Department, and the Municipal Police Bureau Water Police to inspect the ship. This process took half an hour to complete. When the ship arrived in Shanghai and docked at the French Concession wharf at 8:30 AM, detectives from the French Concession Police had already secretly deployed and prohibited idlers from boarding the ship. The Shandong steamer, which transferred the Tongzhou steamer's passengers, also arrived at Wusong yesterday morning and underwent a similar inspection, which was even stricter than the Tongzhou steamer's. After three hours, each passenger was individually checked. As a result, more than ten passengers were taken away by the Water Police Force for further investigation before being released. It was not until 11:00 AM that the steamer was able to dock, and it was subjected to a second inspection. The strictness was unprecedented.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Attempt to Seize New Banknotes <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Dapeng Bay pirates had already infiltrated Shanghai at the beginning of January this year. The various shipping companies had been secretly informed in advance by the Hong Kong Police authorities, so the inspection of merchant ships leaving the port was very strict. However, as time passed without any discoveries, they became less vigilant. Little did they know that the pirates had been closely monitoring the movements of various ships in Shanghai. On the 28th of last month, when the Taikoo Company's Tongzhou steamer was heading to Tianjin, the local Bank of China had a batch of newly printed one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan banknotes, totaling 250,000 yuan, packed in five boxes, to be transported to Tianjin for use in North China. The design of these new banknotes featured an ox plowing the fields. Although the place names and numbers had been compiled, the signatures and seals had not yet been affixed. The original plan was to add the signatures and seals after arriving in Tianjin to ensure prudence. Unexpectedly, the bandits learned of this plan and attempted to seize the banknotes.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Secret Transportation of Firearms <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Although the Tongzhou steamer was strictly inspected when it left Shanghai last month, the bandits' firearms were not found. After the reporter inquired in detail with the crew members, it was learned that the Tongzhou steamer arrived in Shanghai on the 26th and remained docked for three days. During these three days, many passengers boarded and disembarked. The pirates' firearms were likely secretly transported onto the ship during these three days, when the crowds were noisy, and hidden in places where people could not see them. Therefore, when they boarded the ship as passengers on the 28th, their firearms could not be discovered. There were a total of eleven pirates, including one leader, who was about thirty years old with a dark complexion. After boarding the ship, they dispersed and stayed in the steerage cabins. The bandits claimed that there were twenty-four of them, which was an exaggeration. The steamer departed at 10:00 AM on the 28th. At 6:00 PM that day, when it reached the sea off Sheshan, the bandits launched the robbery.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Control of the Entire Ship <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>At that time, dinner was being served on the ship. The bandit leader seized the opportunity to order his gang to jump out of the steerage cabins, each carrying a pistol and a Mauser pistol, and go straight up to the deck via the staircases on both sides. More than seventy Western adults and children were playing on the deck. The White Russian security guard, seeing this, hurriedly tried to open fire to resist the enemy, but because the bandits were mixed in with the children, he feared causing accidental injury, so he raised his gun but did not fire. The bandit leader took the initiative and shot the Russian guard to death. He also knocked down two engineers before going straight to the bridge, dismantling the radio, and taking the captain into custody. In about two hours, the entire ship was completely under the control of the pirates, who changed course and headed towards South China.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Great Disappointment for the Bandits <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The pirates' goal was the 250,000 yuan in new banknotes, so after occupying the entire ship, they informed the crew members that they could not leave their cabins unless there was something wrong, in which case they could call for them. They then ordered the crew members to quickly open the bank vault and hand over the banknotes. The crew members, under duress, had no choice but to hand over the five boxes of banknotes. Upon opening them, they saw that they were not signed and knew that they could not be used. The bandit leader was greatly frustrated.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Three Days of Robbery <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The bandit leader then told the crew members and passengers, "Our hope of not robbing the crew members and passengers has completely failed. You must know that we spent more than 4,000 yuan to come to Shanghai from Hong Kong, and now we have gained nothing. How can we return empty-handed?" He immediately ordered the crew members to hand over all their cash and robbed all the passengers of their belongings. However, the bandit leader informed the bandits that they should not rob women and children by force. In total, the search and robbery began on the morning of the 29th and lasted for three nights and two days. The bandits used the main dining room as their command post, and all the stolen goods were placed in the main dining room.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Maritime Police Officer Dies in the Line of Duty <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Maritime Police Officer Tihornoff, a White Russian, was shot in the head and died on the deck. Second Engineer Macdonald was shot in the shoulder when he retrieved a pistol from his cabin and came out to resist. The ship had a total of twelve pistols, long guns, and five Mauser pistols, with hundreds of rounds of ammunition, which were used by five maritime police officers and six senior crew members for self-defense, but they were all confiscated by the pirates. The body of the Russian guard who was killed on the second day was thrown into the sea by the pirates. Because the Second Engineer resisted, the pirates wanted to kill him, but after the First Mate repeatedly pleaded with the bandit leader, his life was spared.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Search and Seizure of Cash <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>When the eleven pirates were robbing, they all took off their clothes, wore only single layers, and went barefoot. Before the robbery, the bandit leader had said, "The banknotes cannot be used, please pool together some money." First, they searched the passengers' belongings, and then they went to the compradore's office to confiscate the passenger tickets. The head compradore, Wang Jintao, was not on the ship, but the second compradore, Chen Qinghao, was on board and had no choice but to let them search and rob. There was a female passenger named Mao in the steerage cabin with two children, who only had five dollars on her. The bandit said, "Your travel expenses are too little to go to Tianjin," and ordered the bandits not to rob her, but instead the bandit leader gave her ten dollars. There was also an old woman who was wearing ragged clothes and only had two dollars on her. The bandits also gave her five dollars. The two prostitutes in cabin number nine were found to be selling their bodies for the first time, and the bandit leader ordered the bandits not to rob them. As for the Western children, after consultations with the teachers, they voluntarily pooled together three or four hundred dollars, and they were not searched. As a result of the search and seizure, a total of more than two thousand dollars was obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Two Passengers Lucky <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>There were more than one hundred Chinese passengers on the ship. This time, the bandits' robbery was different from previous robberies. The bandit leader's goal was the banknotes, and he did not value the passengers' and crew members' money. Therefore, during the search and robbery, he did not allow the bandits to act wildly. One bandit was searching a crew member and was more abusive, which was seen by the bandit leader, who punched the bandit to the ground. As a result, many crew members and passengers retained their money. Two passengers carried checks, bank deposit books, and cash, totaling more than 200,000 yuan. They were familiar with the crew members, who temporarily hid them on their behalf. As a result, they were not taken away, which was extremely fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Forcibly Seizing a Civilian Boat <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>At around 2:00 PM on February 1st, the ship sailed to the sea off Kowloon Mountain near Huizhou, about nine hours' sailing time from Hong Kong. The pirates prepared to leave the ship and blew conch shells on the ship as a signal to find a civilian boat. After a long time, they could not find one. Finally, they discovered a large sailing boat. The pirates ordered it to approach. It turned out that the sailing boat was also a pirate boat, with three men and one woman on board. They had clashed with the Tongzhou steamer pirates. Later, four pirates from the Tongzhou steamer launched a sampan and jumped onto the sailing boat, forcibly detaining it and ordering it to approach the Tongzhou steamer to transport the stolen goods in preparation for carrying them to the Kowloon Mountain side.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Seizing Cargo <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>When the pirates were about to leave, they opened the cargo hold and took out ten boxes of foreign cloth, carrying away dozens of bolts, as well as a box of socks, five barrels of oranges, and a box of candy, all of which were transferred to the sailing boat. There were two bags of mail on the ship, which were also opened by the bandits to check for valuables. As a result, nothing was taken. A postal basket containing 250,000 yuan in postage stamps was torn up by the bandits, but they were not taken away. Although the five boxes of banknotes were not signed, the bandit leader still confiscated them, claiming that he still had a big boss to whom he had to hand them over. The only crew members whose clothes were confiscated were the two compradores, who lost several suits. The bedding of the staff in the accounting office was also taken away.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Abduction Foiled <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>When the pirates left the ship, they originally wanted to abduct seven Chinese passengers as a way to extort ransoms. When the hostages were getting into the sampan, the sailors on the ship told them that the sampan was too small to accommodate so many people. The pirates released three people and only took four people with them. When they arrived at the Kowloon Mountain side, one group of pirates escorted the stolen goods away first, while the other group accompanied the hostages. Fortunately, the British Navy in Hong Kong had received a telegram from the Shanghai company entrusting the Coastal Defense Department to telegram the Hong Kong Navy, requesting a search. Therefore, two aircraft were dispatched, along with one Chinese aircraft, to conduct reconnaissance. The aircraft flew very low, and the pirates were greatly alarmed. They went back on board and dragged the First Mate and a telegraph operator onto the sampan as protective talismans to send them ashore. The sampan arrived at the foot of the mountain, but the pirates, in their panic, overturned the sampan on the seashore.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Aircraft Reconnaissance <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The aircraft flew close to the ship, clearly observed the situation, and intended to drop bombs. The captain was greatly alarmed because the sampan contained the First Mate and the radio operator. He hurriedly wrote large characters on the ship, asking them not to drop bombs and not to pursue the bandits, to ensure the safety of everyone. The aircraft then left. Seeing that the first sampan had been destroyed, the Tongzhou steamer hurriedly launched another sampan and carried the First Mate, the radio operator, and the passengers back. The radio, which had been dismantled, was also retrieved by the captain from the bandits and reinstalled. Therefore, the Tongzhou steamer departed at about 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the first day.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Old Story Revisited <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The pirates on the ship told the crew members that the robbery of the Tongzhou nine years ago was also committed by them. The big boss had been replaced, but the brothers were still the same. There were thousands of people in the mountains who depended on this for a living. They also claimed that if they were to rob in Shanghai, their skills would be greater than the local thieves, but they did not want to rob small shops that were making a small profit. The reason they robbed the Tongzhou this time was because they were after the bank's banknotes, because the losses to the bank would be less than those to small shops.</p>

<p>After the bandits left the ship, three British warships arrived to protect the Tongzhou and escort it to Hong Kong. By then, it was already dark, and searchlights were used to indicate the Hong Kong航线. The ship arrived in Hong Kong at 11:00 PM that night. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong authorities thoroughly inspected all the passengers and dispatched a large number of armed detectives to the ship to be on duty and stationed. It is heard that the Hong Kong government awarded the captain of the Tongzhou a medal for his meritorious service in preserving the lives of the British on board and ensuring that none of the seventy-three children were injured. The injured Second Engineer was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. The gunshot wound to his shoulder was not life-threatening.</p>

<p>All of the Chinese passengers on the ship, totaling one hundred and ten people, transferred to the Shandong steamer in Hong Kong to come to Shanghai. There were twenty-two people in the cabin and eighty-eight people in the steerage. The Western passengers and seventy-three children were still carried by the Tongzhou back to Shanghai. The Tongzhou steamer left Hong Kong on February 2nd and arrived at Wusongkou at 6:46 AM yesterday and at the dock at 8:00 AM. The Shandong steamer arrived at Wusongkou at 7:35 AM yesterday and docked at around 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company yesterday notified all the cargo owners and provided a clear notification of the stolen cargo, and notified the Bank of China that all five boxes of new banknotes had been confiscated. The other goods were still on the ship. It is now scheduled to depart for Yantai and Tianjin on the 9th. The seventy-three Western children will still take the original ship to Yantai. A team of British Marines dispatched from Shanghai to Tianjin will take the Tongzhou steamer to Tianjin.</p>

<p>A proclamation issued by the Songhu Garrison Command states: "It has been received from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission on January 30th of this year: "Upon reviewing Article 5 of the Regulations on the Strict Prohibition of Potent Narcotics, which stipulates that anyone who has been taken into custody by government authorities and ordered to undergo medical treatment for a specified period to quit the habit, but who repeats the use of potent narcotics, shall be executed. This is to eradicate the atmosphere of drug use and severely punish repeat offenders. The same law shall apply to those who voluntarily surrender themselves to request rehabilitation but relapse. However, because the law has not been clearly defined, provinces and cities have been seeking clarification. After reviewing and approving the measures, it has been decided that anyone who is addicted to drugs, voluntarily surrenders themselves to request rehabilitation, and is given a certificate by the government authorities, and who submits a written pledge that they will be executed if they relapse and is released, shall be treated as if they had been taken into custody, ordered to undergo medical treatment, and relapsed, and shall be dealt with in accordance with the latter part of Article 5 of the regulations. Those whose circumstances of the crime are pitiable and excusable may be granted a reduction in sentence in accordance with the law. You are to comply with this and inform all subordinates." In addition to issuing orders, this proclamation is hereby issued to inform the public."</p>
<p>Ten years ago, after the ship encountered pirates, the naval court conducted a public inspection. The British authorities feel that a non-public inspection can gain more insights and be completed more quickly. The ship is scheduled to depart for Yantai on Saturday morning with the original passengers. The children on board will temporarily stay with relatives and friends. The China Inland Mission is scheduled to hold a tea party tomorrow afternoon at 4:00 PM to entertain them.</p>
<h3 id="e149">New Check Clearing Method Revised by the Joint Reserve Board of Banks <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>To be Implemented from February 8th</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Board of Banks in this city has found that in recent times, interbank remittances between the head offices and branch offices of various banks in other locations often use credit letters or three-part credit slips instead of bank drafts. The nature of these instruments is quite different from the entrustment payment documents other than bank-specified instruments. The payment methods still need to be standardized to ensure uniformity. It is understood that this issue has been resolved at the 16th meeting of the Check Clearing House Committee of the Association, which has formulated the following payment methods for credit letters or credit slips that are in the nature of bank drafts: (1) The remittance credit letters or three-part credit slips used between the head offices and branch offices of each clearing bank must have the words "For Clearing" stamped on the face of the instrument, otherwise it will be regarded as a return item. (2) Each clearing bank should immediately notify its branch offices in other locations that all silver dollar credit letters or credit slips issued for clearing must have the words "For Clearing" stamped on them. (3) The payment methods for remittance credit letters or credit slips issued by entities other than the clearing banks and their branch offices shall continue to be handled according to the original practices of each bank. It is heard that these measures will be implemented from (the 8th).</p>

<p>Zhong Yangqi Scheduled to Leave the Country on the 13th</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway previously leased locomotives from the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. Subsequently, it was determined that the locomotives would be of the 4-8-4 type, which would be manufactured in England. For the sake of prudence, the Ministry of Railways previously appointed Ying Shangfang, a commissioner of the Technical Standards Committee, to go to England to be stationed at the factory to liaise, guide the design, and supervise the construction. Considering the special cargo transport conditions and bridge load limits of the railway, the Two Railways Administration requested and was granted approval from the Ministry of Railways to specially appoint Zhong Yangqi, a mechanical engineer and the head of the design section of the Engineering Department of the Machinery Department, to go to England to monitor the manufacturing along with Commissioner Ying. Chief Zhong is scheduled to leave the country by ship on the 13th of this month and is expected to be stationed in England for about seven months. Afterwards, he will take the opportunity to visit locomotive factories and locomotive depots on various railways in England for two or three months to gain experience.</p>

<p>Located at the Former Site of the Wusong Seashore Hotel</p>
<p>Features an Observation Deck with Views of Approaching Ships</p>
<p>Infected Passengers Will Be Kept There for Examination and Treatment</p>
<p>The Port Quarantine Administration believes that the number of ships entering and leaving the port in this city is increasing daily, and the quarantine work must also be actively intensified. Therefore, it has built the most modern quarantine hospital at Wusong, which is now completed. In the future, when infected passengers are found on incoming ships, they can be isolated and treated there, and disinfection can be carried out. As the matter is important, a reporter from the Datong News Agency has recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">New Quarantine Hospital <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Port Quarantine Administration already has a quarantine hospital in Pudong, which was received from the Customs Office. However, the equipment is no longer modern, and its location is somewhat remote. Therefore, it purchased the old site of the Wusong Seashore Hotel to build the most modern quarantine hospital. Now that the hospital site has been completed, it can be opened and isolation, examination, and treatment can be implemented as soon as the equipment is installed.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Internal Observation Tower <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Medical equipment includes isolation wards, quarantine rooms, clothing disinfection rooms, bathhouses, and so on. At the same time, an observation tower, 56 feet high, has been rebuilt in the hospital compound to observe incoming ships outside the Wusong estuary. It is said that by climbing the tower and looking into the distance, the masts and sails of ships within tens of miles can be seen at a glance, which is especially effective in assisting quarantine work.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Importance of the Nature <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>According to Zhou Zhongqian, Secretary of the Quarantine Administration, the new-style quarantine hospital will soon be completed in terms of equipment. In the future, travelers infected with the epidemic will be kept there for isolation and treatment, so as not to delay the import time of ships. At the same time, because the hospital is equipped with an observation tower, ships coming to Shanghai with yellow flags can also be seen in advance, and medical officers can be dispatched to inspect the ships quickly, which is more convenient.</p>

<p>Starting from February</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the provincial government that the deed tax on fields and houses, which was originally levied at 9.6%, has been reduced to 6.3% from September of the 23rd year, limited to three months. It has been extended twice for three months, and will expire at the end of January of this year. It should have been terminated and no longer extended. However, after last year's drought, the people's conditions were dilapidated and material resources were difficult. Those who established deeds for buying fields and houses before could not pay taxes within the time limit everywhere. If the reduction and collection are not extended again, it is feared that it will cause wait-and-see attitudes and lose the purpose of enriching taxes and caring for the people. Now, starting from February of this year, the reduced tax rate of 6.3% will be extended for another three months. The original collection of surcharges and Chinese-funded donations will still be reduced in proportion to the previous case, so as to reduce the burden, etc. After the county government received the order, in addition to ordering the public offices in each district, township, and town to comply with it, it also announced it to the whole county for everyone to know.</p>

<p>Replaced if the Inspection and Acceptance Does Not Match the Original Sample, and the Delay Will Be Extended Again</p>
<p>The central district branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications was built. After the new building was completed, the materials ordered from England were delayed in import, which caused the opening of machine installation and calls to be postponed again and again. A part of the materials arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. The ministry ordered Yu Bingjian, the chief engineer of the bureau, to inspect and accept them. However, because they did not match the original sample and were difficult to apply, the Yangxing company responsible for the defense still replaced them from England. According to the chief engineer Yu Bingjian, the original plan to open the call in March will now be postponed due to this matter. At the same time, it will delay the installation procedures for Minhang users, because the bureau originally planned to dismantle the Jiangwan branch after the completion of the new bureau in the central district and install the Jiangwan parts to Minhang users.</p>

<p>Changes After Zhu Xiaomei's Disappearance</p>
<p>Wu Fushun (39 years old), a local, has lived near the left side of Wujia Land Tang in Pudong since he was a child, and made a living by farming. In the past, he married a wife, Ms. Lu, and had a son named Longsheng, who has already married. Ms. Lu died of illness. In June of last year, Sun Jiangshi, Chen Ashun, and others acted as matchmakers for Wu Fushun to remarry Zhu Xiaomei (43 years old), a Chongming woman, as a successor. Since Xiaomei passed the door, the couple still showed affection. Unexpectedly, only two months after the marriage, Sun Jiangshi, Chen Ashun, and others suddenly came to Wu's house and declared that they would go to Shanghai together, on the grounds of watching a play, and took Xiaomei out with them. Since then, she has never returned. More than ten days later, unexpectedly, a female corpse was found in a flower field of a certain surname about five miles away from Wu's house. The police station in charge reported to the local court and sent personnel to verify that the female corpse was indeed Zhu Xiaomei, who had been missing for more than ten days, and was murdered and abandoned there. Wu Fushun was in a suspicious position and was sent to the court by the police station. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang questioned and ruled to detain him, and prosecuted the criminal court with murder. At 2 pm yesterday, Judge Guan Liting specially opened the 10th court for trial, ordering Wu Fushun, who was in custody, to be brought to the case for a long time of investigation, and Prosecutor Lei made a plea. Then, the appointed lawyer Zhou Yuqi defended him and requested to declare him not guilty. The judge considered the conclusion and decided to pronounce the verdict on the 13th of this month. Wu Fushun was sent back to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Route to Russia <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Because the Soviet Union telegraphed at the time to take the Siberian train to Moscow, I had to go to Vladivostok from Shanghai. Because Russian ships have no fixed schedule, and the Cultural Association agreed to arrive in Moscow before March 15, it is planned to change the route to Japan, from Kobe to Tsuruga to Vladivostok, in order to be simple and quick. This ticket has been booked. However, recently, the Soviet Union sent another telegram saying that it had decided to send a special ship from Vladivostok to Shanghai to meet Ambassador Yan and myself. Because the Soviet government is so generous, it decided to change the route and take the ship with Ambassador Yan to Vladivostok. At first, it was planned to visit Kyoto for one and a half days, but the day before yesterday, a telegram suddenly arrived from Tokyo, saying that Baron Okura and old friends from the literary and artistic circles planned to hold a meeting in Tokyo on the 24th to say goodbye. The intention was extremely touching, but now that the route has changed, I have sent a telegram to decline. As for the rumors that I will perform in Japan first, there is no such intention at all. The name of the special ship sent by the Russian side has not yet been telegraphed from Vladivostok, but it is known that the departure date from Shanghai is approximately between February 18th, 19th and 25th of the week.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Traveling Companions <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the troupe, Mr. Zhang Pengchun and Mr. Yu Shangyuan will also be traveling with us. Mr. Yu is a drama expert who studies drama and has a long-standing reputation. Moreover, he is a good friend of many years. He happens to have the convenience of going to Europe, so I invited him to travel with me and got his permission a long time ago. Mr. Zhang's literature and art are well-known internationally, but he is the principal of Nankai Middle School and a full-time professor in the Department of Philosophy and Education at the university. I have repeatedly asked him to travel with me for several months, but Mr. Zhang has not been able to agree due to school affairs. When Lanfang performed in the United States in the past, all planning and guidance were deeply supported by Mr. Zhang. When Mr. Zhang returned to China from Honolulu to give lectures in the summer, he also discussed preparations for going to Russia with him. This time, the Soviet Union announced the members of the preparatory committee for inviting the Mei Lanfang Troupe, who are all central figures in the Soviet culture, and there are also senior officials from the diplomatic circles. The Soviet state is so solemnly handling the matter, and repeatedly stated that this invitation is entirely for the purpose of studying and learning from each other, so we must invite more experts to guide us, so as to achieve perfection. Later, Ambassador Yan asked Mr. Zhang on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to travel with Lanfang again, and yesterday he received his reply agreeing to the school to give him two months of leave. This is indeed very satisfactory. However, I feel very sorry for Nankai University, but it is a matter of international reputation, and I dare not make personal plans. Approximately, after Lanfang performs in Russia, Mr. Zhang will return to China immediately, and Lanfang himself will travel to Europe with Mr. Yu Shangyuan to expand his knowledge and increase his learning. The members of the Mei Troupe will go south on the 10th, because there are still two days of charity performances for the Jiangzhe drought in Shanghai, and two days of charity performances for the Ciyou Association organized by Minister Kong, a total of four days of performances, so I have to come early. As for all the purchases and arrangements in Beijing, they are all due to the efforts of Mr. Qi Rushan.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Commemorative Monument to the Martyrs of Jiangwan (January 28th) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>More Than 1,300 Patriotic Souls Who Died for Their Country</p>
<p>Patriots Donate Funds Separately to Accomplish This</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reported that the reporter took the opportunity of the January 28th commemoration to visit the January 28th Martyrs Cemetery organized by Jiangwan Chongshan Hall. The cemetery covers an area of 10 mu and contains more than 1,300 bodies of soldiers and civilians who died in the Shanghai War. According to the person in charge of the hall, the coffin and burial expenses were donated by Mr. Wang Weiguan, general manager of Delong Tobacco Company, and the directors Cai Xiangsun and others donated funds for the burial. Recently, after the burial was completed, in order to leave a permanent memorial to comfort the souls of the martyrs, a monument was built in front of the tomb. The cost was donated by Yan Enzhang, the former director of the Diplomatic Office in Shanghai. A memorial archway was also built at the entrance, and the plaques have been submitted to famous figures of the Party and the country for inscription, in order to show respect. The project was designed by architect Quan Renyuan and constructed by Cai Hongji Shuimu, requiring a total of more than 2,000 yuan in silver. It is expected that the entire project can be completed by the end of March this year. Currently, the Municipal Engineering Bureau has submitted a request to the municipal government to build the January 28th Martyrs Cemetery Memorial Road from Yueshi Bridge to the Martyrs Cemetery, and the road plan has been surveyed and will be built soon to facilitate transportation. The reporter also asked whether the tomb was the same as the Tomb of Anonymous Heroes. According to the reply, the Tomb of Anonymous Heroes is located in Miaohang and was initiated and built by famous figures in Shanghai. There are no bodies in the tomb, only a tomb for people to admire, and the scale is very large, with a construction cost of 240,000 yuan, which is completely different from the Martyrs Cemetery.</p>

<p>Two People Confess to Going to Rob Together</p>
<p>The Other Two Completely Deny It</p>
<p>The iron factory department of the Engineering Office of the Public Works Department at 630 Maohai Road was about to issue wages and year-end bonuses at 1:55 pm on the 1st of this month when it was suddenly invaded by Zhou Agen, Chen Xiaowuzi, and others from Liyang, who organized a gang and broke in with weapons, robbing 20,714 yuan of silver bills and fleeing. As a result, Zhou Thief was captured and recovered the original stolen goods of 18,709 yuan. When Chen Thief was being rounded up by the Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishan Patrol House, both sides opened fire. A bullet hit the Yao Shu and killed him, and seized a gun and twelve bullets. The body was sent to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road, and the prosecutor went to the office to verify and coffinate the body. Zhou Thief was escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, and other matters have been recorded in this newspaper. During the change of period, the Chinese detective Shang Wu of the Huishi Patrol House, detectives Li Wenbin and Zhu Heshang, learned that the accomplices in the case were hiding at 55 Huapan Road and Room 5 of the Zhengxin Hotel at 66 Huapan Road in the French Concession. So at about 6 pm the day before yesterday, they went secretly in collaboration with the Western detectives and detained Liu Xiaowuzi from Yancheng and Wang Afu from Zhenjiang at the address, and confiscated two pistols and nineteen bullets. Together with the suspected criminals Wang Zhenrong and Chen Guangyi from Yangzhou, they were taken back to the Huishan Patrol House and detained. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Court Three. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Public Works Department, explained the previous situation in detail and requested an adjournment to be questioned together with Zhou Agen. Then, according to Detective Shang's report of the process, Liu Xiaowuzi and Wang Afu confessed to going to rob together, while Wang Zhenrong and Chen Guangyi completely denied it, saying that they went to the place at that time to find Wang Afu for a chat and to seek appraisal. Judge Xiao Xiequn ordered them to be remanded in custody and changed the date to be tried together with Zhou Agen.</p>

<p>Dasheng Hardware Store Denies Sending It</p>
<p>Saying That the Truth Will Come Out in the Future</p>
<p>The police authorities in Taixian, Jiangsu Province, previously seized a parcel sent by Dasheng Shenzhuang in Shanghai to a silver shop in Taixian. Upon inspection, it was found that the parcel was full of raw materials for manufacturing red pills. The county government immediately started investigating and asked the post office to investigate the location of Dasheng Shenzhuang. According to the receipt of the parcel tax payment, the post office found that the address was Dasheng Hardware Store at 631 Guangdong Road. So the county government sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court requesting that the owner of Dasheng Hardware Store be summoned. The court approved the issuance of a summons, which was sent to the Old Zha Patrol House, ordering the detectives to summon Guo Qiufang, the owner of Dasheng Hardware Store, a Wuxi native, to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the patrol house, stated the circumstances of the summons. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, asked whether there was a parcel sent to a silver shop in Taixian. Guo Qiufang denied the matter and said that he had no contact with the silver shop. As for whether the parcel was sent by his store, he said that the truth would come out in the future. Judge Qian said that the case was a request for a collaborative summons from Taixian. The official document only asked for a summons and bail and did not mention anything else. Therefore, he would wait for a reply from Taixian before reviewing the case. Guo Qiufang was ordered to pay a store guarantee of 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Ma Erbao's Home Is an Opium Den</p>
<p>Liu Dezhi, the owner of Dade Oil Factory, was previously kidnapped and escaped danger. The suspected criminals in the case were broken by the Water Police Team. The criminals confessed that the kidnapping was led by Qiu and Zhou, but they did not know their address, only that they often went to Ma Erbao's house in Jiumudi. The team released the prisoners to the local court for interrogation. The prosecutor's office issued a search warrant and sent a police officer, Zhou Qiwu, and informed the Old North Gate Police Station, requesting that police officers be dispatched to assist in the arrest. At 6 pm the day before yesterday, Zhou Police went secretly to Ma Erbao's house to search. The so-called Qiu and Zhou kidnappers were not there. However, it was discovered that Ma Erbao was running a large-scale opium den with many opium smokers. Zhou Police found contraband and immediately arrested Ma Erbao, Deng Zhangshi, Zhang Jinsheng, Li Acai, and others, a total of twenty-four people, and confiscated several sets of smoking paraphernalia, all of which were sent to the Old North Gate Police Station for verification. After Director Shen briefly questioned them, he ruled that the police be taken to the court for legal action and reported the case to the bureau for filing.</p>

<p>The Wedding Will Be Held at the Moore Memorial Church on Three Ma Road</p>
<p>Xiong Is Sixty-Six Years Old, the New Lady Is Over Thirty Years Old</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling, Zi Bingsan, former Premier of the State Council during the Beiyang government, has been devoted to child welfare since retiring from his political career. He has been operating the Xiangshan Ciyou Academy in Peiping with great success, which is deeply admired by people all over the country. A few years ago, he wrote a mourning poem for his deceased wife, and since then his household has been without a mistress. Recently, Mr. Xiong, through the introduction of others, married Ms. Mao Wenyuan, and the wedding is scheduled to be held at the Moore Memorial Church on Tibet Road at 2 pm tomorrow (9th). Pastor Zhu Baoyuan is invited to officiate the wedding, and the wedding ceremony will be entirely in accordance with Christian rites. Ms. Mao graduated from Pingnv Normal University, studied in the United States for many years, and has great talent in literature and is particularly interested in child welfare. Xiong is from Fenghuang County, Hunan Province. It is said that the new lady is only thirty-three years old, while Xiong is already sixty-six years old, which is quite a poignant thought of white hair and rosy cheeks. This is also a good story in the political world. It is also known that the Xiong couple has scheduled a banquet for relatives and friends at the New Asia Restaurant on North Sichuan Road at 6 pm that evening.</p>
<p>Peiping 7th telegram, Xiong Xiling married in Shanghai on the 9th, Jiang Han telegraphed to Shanghai this morning to congratulate Xiong, the original telegram words are fragrant and prominent, in which there is a sentence (in the red silk tent, I wish you to grow old and be courageous).</p>
<p>The eight people were separately escorted to the Criminal Court Eight of the First Special Court yesterday morning by the eight police stations. Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for a collective hearing. The defendants jointly hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. The lawyer of the patrol house, Zhang Tianyin, stood up and stated that the patrol house is prosecuting the first, second, third, and fourth defendants for robbery under Article 348, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The fifth and sixth defendants are currently detained in the Public Security Bureau, and the other seven, eight, nine, and ten defendants have not been prosecuted. He requested permission to detain them. On the morning of the 31st of last month, at 11:30 am, the first to sixth defendants held weapons and organized a gang to break into the house of Ms. Yao Guo at 24 Lane 228 of Baker Road and robbed property worth 305 yuan. Then, on the morning of the 4th of this month, at 11:50 am, a rickshaw puller, Xu Hesan (the tenth defendant), suddenly carried two pistols and reported to the patrol house, saying that a passenger (the third defendant, Wang Gongxian) hired a car in front of the Da Zhong Hotel on Aido Road this morning, got off at the Xinzha Bridge, and left two pistols behind, so he came to report it specially. The patrolman ordered detectives to go with Xu to Room 10 of the Dahua Apartment at 451 Pope Road and arrested the first and second defendants in this case. According to their confessions, the other defendants were successively arrested and brought back to the patrol house. The informant, Yao Guo, Shen Jinbao, Shen Changshi, Shen Améi, pointed out the first, third, fourth, and third defendants, and found that the three had robbed two pistols and ornaments worth 3,052 yuan in cash at the home of Yang Taiyi at 18 Lane 504 of Fuxu Road at 12:10 pm on November 3 last year. Therefore, among the two guns carried by rickshaw puller Xu Hesan to the patrol house, one of the long ones belonged to the Yang family's robbed items. Yang Lingdi, the daughter of the informant, pointed out that the first and third defendants were at the scene at that time. The third defendant, Wang Gongxian, wore black glasses and held a small pistol, binding the informant and others to the bed and stuffing their mouths with objects so that they could not speak. It took a long time, so they were able to identify them. However, the tenth defendant, Xu Hesan, was the first to report the crime, and the patrol house should have rewarded him because of this. It was only because the third defendant confessed that he was an accomplice. When robbing Fuxu Road, Xu was responsible for transporting firearms, so he was also listed as a defendant. The patrol house has not fully investigated the case and requested permission for an adjournment. He also requested that a written document be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to transfer the fifth and sixth defendants for interrogation. Judge Wu slightly questioned the informants, witnesses, and defendants and ordered them to be sent back to custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Four Robbers Sentenced <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Robbing Repeatedly in the Baseball Field Area</p>
<p>Committing As Many As Sixteen Consecutive Cases</p>
<p>The four robbers, Yang Xiaobao, Chen Xiaosizi, Chen Youqing, and Yang Tongguo (nicknamed Yang Tonggu), from Jiangbei, are all brothers and relatives. They used to make a living by pulling rickshaws. Last winter, due to the difficulty of life, they changed their occupation to street robbers. They used the section of the French Concession from Saposai Road's Père Hilaire to Kangdi Road, which is located in a remote area and has only baseball fields on both sides, with no residents and few people, as an opportunity. They would lie in ambush in the Cangqiao Lane next to the Public Works Department's Lihua Children's Public School, waiting for passersby to pass by, and then come out to rob their property. Late on the night of the third of last month, the detectives of the French patrol house, Zhou Ruzhang and Gao Hongxuan, first captured the two bandits, Yang Xiaobao and Chen Xiaosizi, in the area and escorted them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. At midnight on the tenth of the same month, the detective of the French patrol house, Zhang Ziying, passed in front of the Public Works Department's Chinese Children's Public School and suddenly encountered two bandits who rushed out of a small alley to rob. Zhang pretended to reach into his pocket to take out money, pulled out his pistol, and ordered them to raise their hands. The two bandits were startled and surrendered. They were taken into the patrol house, and their names were Chen Youqing and Yang Tongguo. They were accomplices of the Yang and Chen bandits who were previously captured. The next day, they were escorted to the court for interrogation and combined investigation. The details have been recorded in the previous newspaper. Subsequently, the patrol house found that the bandits had committed as many as sixteen consecutive robbery cases in the section of Saposai Road and elsewhere. Late on the night of the fourth of the same month, they robbed Xu Xin, an officer of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, of cash and ornaments. Later, because the victim was robbed and had no money, he could not go home. The bandits gave the victim a small foreign coin worth two jiao and instructed him to take a rickshaw home. The detectives in charge, Zhou Ruzhang, and others, investigated the case, transferred the victim to retrieve the stolen goods, and sent them to the court's police department, prosecuting them for continuous robbery. Judge Zhang Chaozu tried and concluded the case. The day before yesterday, Judge Zhang opened the court and sentenced Chen Youqing and Yang Tongguo to eight years of imprisonment each, Yang Xiaobao to seven years of imprisonment, and Chen Xiaosizi to three years and six months of imprisonment. After the sentence was passed, the defendants were transferred to the detention center to wait for the appeal period before being sent to prison.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Rickshaws: A Summary of Developments <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council’s Rickshaw Management Committee was formed in early May of last year. Recently, the committee chairman, Mr. Massey, reported to the Board of Directors on the progress of work during the past year. A summary is recorded below:</p>
<p>Registering Genuine Rickshaw Owners: The primary task of the Rickshaw Committee was to conduct rickshaw owner registration. Previously, the 9,990 rickshaw licenses were registered under the names of 144 individuals, leading to illegal resale of licenses. After the owner registration, only the owners themselves could obtain the licenses. After the announcement, rickshaw owners came to register enthusiastically. Later, due to obstruction from the Rickshaw Owners Association, owner certificates could not be issued as scheduled. Subsequently, the Bureau announced that from August onward, rickshaws without owner certificates would no longer be able to obtain operating licenses, and the vacancies would be filled by new applicants. At one point, there were 4,894 applicants requesting a total of over 47,000 rickshaws. Later, the old rickshaw owners were willing to handle the matter according to the agreed-upon method, and the new applicants had no licenses to be allocated. The Rickshaw Committee then conducted a detailed review of the qualifications of the old rickshaw owners who requested registration, and as a result, issued 1,080 owner certificates. Since August, the licenses for the vehicles have been issued entirely based on the owner certificates to the genuine rickshaw owners.</p>
<p>Establishing Standard Rickshaw Rental Rates: The second important task of the Rickshaw Committee was to reduce rickshaw rental rates and establish standards. This was approved by the Board of Directors on August 7th. Subsequently, the rickshaw rental rate was set at 78 cents (dollars) per day. According to previous investigations, the rental rate had been as high as $1.10, which was quite beneficial to the rickshaw pullers. However, monitoring compliance with the rickshaw rental standard was very difficult, as the rental was not for the entire day but in shifts, and the rickshaw owners also collected debts and rent from the rickshaw pullers, resulting in unclear accounts. The Rickshaw Committee has ordered that all extra income be recorded in separate accounts for inspection at any time. However, the greatest difficulty was that the rickshaw pullers dared not confront the rickshaw owners directly, fearing that offending the rickshaw owners would result in no rickshaws to pull. Therefore, the Rickshaw Committee could only implement supervision through other methods, and if necessary, revoke or withhold licenses as punishment. As for the rickshaw rental amount, it should be reduced to 80 cents in small coins (approximately 60 cents in silver dollars) in the future.</p>
<p>Registration of Chartered Rickshaw Pullers: The next step for the Rickshaw Committee was to register all rickshaw pullers, requiring them to comply with regulations and obtain licenses. Starting on September 1st of last year, registration began for private rickshaws (chartered rickshaws). The registration method involved first examining knowledge of traffic regulations, then conducting physical examinations and testing hearing and vision. Then, photos were taken, fingerprints recorded, and vaccinations or inoculations were administered. Lecturers explained matters to be noted when pulling rickshaws. After completion, licenses and armbands were issued. In November, an agreement was reached with the French Concession authorities to make licensing of chartered rickshaw pullers mandatory. From November 1st, those without licenses would no longer be allowed to pull rickshaws. By the end of the year, all chartered rickshaw pullers had been registered, totaling 13,262 people. The registration fee was one dollar per person. Licensing of Public Rickshaw Pullers: The original plan was to register a total of 40,000 rickshaw pullers for public rickshaws, with 30,000 recommended by rickshaw owners, and the Shanghai Municipal Council selecting another 10,000. If registration progressed satisfactorily, the remaining 10,000 might also be recommended by rickshaw owners. Since November, blank forms have been distributed to rickshaw owners, and registration began in December. A total of over 5,800 people have been processed, with approximately rejected as unqualified. The registration procedure is the same as for chartered rickshaw pullers. However, during the lectures, it is specifically explained that although recommended by rickshaw owners, there is no , and they are also informed of the organization of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society and its work, and the registration fee has already been paid by the society on their behalf.</p>
<p>Promoting Model New Rickshaws: For the sake of cleanliness and safety of rickshaws, the Rickshaw Committee specifically set the standard for rickshaws. However, rickshaw owners had many objections. By the end of December, 20 of these standard rickshaws had been licensed and put into operation. By the end of January this year, there would be 150. Together, the main force had accumulated unused materials from old-style rickshaws, which were said to be enough to build a much. The Rickshaw Committee then allowed that if rickshaw owners cooperate fully with registration, they could use these old-style new rickshaws for replacement.</p>
<p>Establishing Mutual Aid Association Affairs: For the sake of the rickshaw pullers, the Rickshaw Committee promoted the organization of a Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society. The source of the association fees is collected from the rickshaw pullers by the rickshaw owners, with each rickshaw owner initially advancing $1.50 per rickshaw per month. Social figures who express sympathy and are willing to contribute are also welcome. As for its organization, the Shanghai Municipal Council appoints three members to the fund committee, and a board of directors is established, inviting seven enthusiastic people from society, together with two representatives from the rickshaw owners and the three members of the fund committee, to jointly preside over the affairs. Once the rickshaw pullers are registered, they will immediately elect representatives to join the board of directors. The purpose of the Mutual Aid Society is to provide rickshaw pullers with medical care, bathhouses, housing, schools, cooperatives, savings societies, as well as entertainment and aid for injuries and deaths. Now that it has just begun, it is temporarily setting up a center in the northern and northwestern districts, with the general headquarters located on Dongjiaxing Road, occupying 16,000 square feet, with a rooftop garden of the same area. It is expected to officially open in February. The directors of the board of directors are all fully committed. The income from donations to the Mutual Aid Society, in addition to the $40,000 needed for rickshaw puller registration fees, is used for business expenses and the salaries of required staff. The rickshaw pullers' donations are approximately 11 copper coins per shift. Now that rickshaw rentals have been reduced, this amount should not be difficult to bear.</p>
<p>Other Work Last Year: There were also items such as setting fare tables, improving rickshaw lights, revising license regulations, and cracking down on illegal chartered rickshaws. As for the French Concession and the municipal government, the Rickshaw Committee cooperates whenever possible. However, it is hoped that in the future, all three municipal districts will issue rickshaw licenses directly to the rickshaw owners. Regarding the Rickshaw Committee's work in 1935, there will be no problem with its progress, and its development will depend on the attitude of the rickshaw owners. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council's established policy is to improve the situation of rickshaw pullers and improve the condition of rickshaws. This is something that the general public should know.</p>

<p>Kirin, Triangle, Sino-Western, and Longevity Brands</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior considers the quality of smallpox vaccine to be of utmost importance in the prevention of smallpox. Upon investigation, the Kirin, Triangle, Sino-Western, and Longevity brands of smallpox vaccine sold in Hankou City were found to be ineffective after testing. It has already issued an order to the relevant authorities in all provinces and cities to strictly prohibit their sale. Other commercially available smallpox vaccines are also ordered to be carefully inspected at any time to eliminate malpractices and achieve the effect of vigorously implementing vaccination. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government has received the notification and will strictly inspect the smallpox vaccines sold in the city. If there are any that do not comply with the provisions of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia regarding the clearly stated expiration date, they should be destroyed and fined in accordance with the Regulations for the Management of Pharmacists.</p>

<p>The Municipal Defense Council, in order to examine the performance of the members of the troops in the 16 districts under its jurisdiction, so as to promote the efficiency of winter defense, has been conducting inspections since the end of last month. Because the schedule was predetermined, each team was prepared, making it difficult to distinguish between good and bad. Therefore, starting yesterday, it was changed to random deployment. The inspectors are Chen Ce, Xie Shouquan, Zhu Yuanhui, Yu Da, Li Xiuling, and Wu Youying, etc., six people. The time is still from 8:00 pm to 4:00 am the next morning. Inspections are scheduled to continue until the end of winter defense at the end of February. In addition, the cadre training class attached to the council, all of whose students are store clerks, had suspended training during the year-end closing of accounts for various industries. It is now scheduled to start on the 10th of this month, and the graduation ceremony will be held in March of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Retrial of Zhang Guanghua's Case of Killing His Younger Brother Concludes with Closing Arguments <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Guanghua Still Absolutely Denies It, Sentencing Scheduled for the 13th</p>
<p>Zhang Guanghua, a Henan native living in a three-story pavilion room at 24 Chongde Lane, Minguo Road, outside Xiaobeimen, French Concession, allegedly killed his younger brother Zhang Guangzhou on the evening of November 22nd of last year. Guanghua also suffered knife wounds to his head. The case was transferred by the French Police Department to the Special No. 2 Court, and a public prosecution was filed for the crime of murder. Judge Xiong Huiping repeatedly held hearings and personally visited the scene of the incident. Zhang Guanghua repeatedly denied killing his younger brother in court and hired a lawyer to defend him. Closing arguments have been announced, and sentencing was scheduled. Later, due to lingering doubts in the case, Judge Xiong specially revoked the closing arguments out of prudence and waited for a retrial to be scheduled. Details of the reopening of closing arguments have been reported previously. At 3:00 pm yesterday, Judge Xiong, accompanied by Secretary Tao Zongkan, specially opened the Criminal Court No. 2 for trial. Lawyer Fei Xizhen represented the Police Department in court, and the defense lawyer hired by the defendant also arrived on time. The official ordered the defendant Zhang Guanghua to be brought before the court and said to Zhang, "According to what you previously said, you couldn't see the face of the murderer at the time of the incident. You only saw the murderer cut you and then cut your brother's bed. Now, after detailed review of the testimony of various witnesses and the investigation by the Police Department, and after this court went to your residence to see, the comprehensive review is inconsistent with your various statements in fact. Moreover, after you were injured, you jumped out of the window because you couldn't open the door, and shouted to open the window of Yan Jintao on the second floor to enter. Your door was tightly closed, so how could a third person come in? According to the testimony of witness Yan Jintao, only the sound of you jumping out was heard, and there was no sound of a second person escaping. Moreover, the murder weapon in the case was, according to you, your own, placed under the bed. So how could the murderer calmly take the knife and kill? Judging from all the circumstances, it is true that your brother first held a knife and cut you, and you took the knife and cut back. You should tell the truth." Zhang replied, "My brother and I have always been on good terms. He was very obedient to me. There is no way I would kill my younger brother. If I killed my younger brother, there must be blood stains to prove it. There are no blood stains now. Please be clear." The official also said, "According to what you said, your brother and you have no feud with anyone, no affair, and no intention of robbery. Why did such a tragedy happen?" Zhang replied, "I don't know." The official also said, "According to the circumstances of this case, if you can prove that there was a third person in the room besides you and your brother, there is still something to say. Moreover, the bedding in your room was neat and not messy. This point is enough to prove that your brother cut you first, and you took the knife and cut back. If your brother committed suicide after cutting you, there is no way he would have the strength to cut his own neck." Zhang still categorically denied killing his brother, saying that he had already escaped outside, and he did not know the situation in the room. The official also summoned Qiu Changsheng, Hua Constable No. 455 of the French Concession Police Department, to testify, saying that he was on the preparatory shift that night. They first reported to the police station, and then he went with two detectives. They entered through the back door. The detectives were in front, and he was behind on the stairs. Because he couldn't open the door, he kicked the door open. He saw that the person in the room was already dead, so he closed the door tightly and told them not to enter. At this point, after the secretary read the minutes, the court immediately ordered the start of closing arguments and then announced the adjournment. Sentencing was scheduled for the 13th, and the defendant was still detained pending instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Bureau of Public Safety Orders All Branches to Effectively Crack Down on the Addition of Mezzanines <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Not Only Harmful to Cleanliness and Hygiene</p>
<p>A Fire Can Occur with a Moment's Carelessness</p>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Safety, Wen Chaoji, yesterday received a letter from the Municipal Party Department, stating that (according to a report from the 16th Branch, forwarded by the 4th District Party Department, the buildings in this city are mostly one-story with a kitchen, pavilion, and sun deck, etc. However, landlords often build a second floor mezzanine to divide the front and back of the building, a total of four floors including the upstairs and downstairs mezzanine pavilion, and rent it to three tenants. However, with little space and many people, it is extremely detrimental to hygiene and public order. Moreover, some sun decks that only allow air and sunlight are covered with five-story sheds. Therefore, items such as laundry have to be hung out on the street. This city is a district where Chinese and foreigners gather. This phenomenon is not only harmful to cleanliness and hygiene, but also detrimental to international views. This should be cracked down on, one. Secondly, a fire can occur with a moment's carelessness. According to Western-style architecture, if a house catches fire, it cannot spread to another house. However, the materials of these five-story sheds are all wooden pillars and planks. If house A catches fire, it will spread to house B. And every time a fire is seen, it is mostly mediated by the five-story shed. Every time it is seen that rescue is rapid, the upstairs and downstairs of house B are often not burned, but the five-story shed is already burned out. It has been found that those who rent these multi-story sheds are mostly hard-working people who are greedy for low rents. Once burned in a fire, they are left with nothing, which is very regrettable. This should be cracked down on, two. For this reason, it is appropriate to submit a document to your committee for review and approval, and then forward it to the higher authorities to request the Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Public Safety to prohibit the repair of existing five-story sheds and allow them to disappear naturally. New buildings and buildings that have not been built with five-story sheds will not be issued permits in the future, so as to avoid the danger of fire and take care of the livelihood of the people, etc. It is now learned that after reviewing the letter, the bureau, in addition to informing the Bureau of Public Works, has also issued an order to all branch teams to effectively crack down on it.</p>

<p>Defendant Not Present, Further Trial Pending</p>
<p>Lawyer Tao Gan (Zi Guozhen, native of Yancheng, Jiangsu) joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association as a member in March of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and his business was still not bad. There were fellow villagers, Chen Wentao, etc., who founded the Weiyang New Stage Theater on Robertison Road in West Shanghai. Since its opening, the business has been quite good, but the expenses have been huge, but it is just a formality, and they are deeply afraid that the general unemployed hooligans will find fault. Therefore, they hired lawyer Tao Gan as a year-round legal consultant. At that time, there were contracts for appointment and public expenses, etc., and they have been at peace. At the end of last year's lunar year, Tao Gan requested public expenses from Chen Wentao, the manager of the stage, according to the regulations. However, Chen and others not only did not give public expenses, but instead scolded and scolded him, resulting in the breakdown of many years of friendship. Recently, lawyer Tao Gan felt unbearable because Chen Wentao and others publicly insulted him. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the local court, accusing Chen Wentao and others of defamation and requesting an investigation. After receiving the complaint, the court summoned the defendants Liu Wentao and others to the third court at 1:00 pm yesterday by Chief Criminal Judge Liu Enrong. The defendants Liu Wentao and others were not present. Only the plaintiff, Tao Gan, appeared in court to testify.

When questioned, the defendant denied embezzling any money, and declared that Zhu Xinru was an honorary general manager and never interfered with factory affairs. This time, he suddenly took away the account books and fabricated accounts, and sent him to the police station on New Year's Eve. He requested an investigation, and his agent, lawyer E Sen, requested permission to post bail so that he could go out to investigate the accounts. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered Zhu Yaokun to post a shop guarantee of 15,000 yuan and adjourned the hearing to February 14th.</p>

<p>Fudan Submits 36-48</p>
<p>Tonight at 8:30 PM Facing Donghua</p>
<p>The Qingdao champion Black Eagle Basketball Team made their debut at Shen Yuan last night at 8:30 PM, winning their opening victory by defeating Fudan University 48-36. The performance was clear and the skills were remarkable, which was quite refreshing for the Shanghai people. The team's coordination is also very skilled. The two veteran players, Kong Guangyi and Zhang Yucai, are no less than two big pillars. Therefore, although Fudan is a hero for a time, they had to succumb to others and could not cope with it. The rising stars have unlimited hope. Tonight at 8:30 PM, Black Eagle will play against Donghua, still in the basketball room.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Tense Situation <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The jump ball in the center circle, the fierce battle began, shuttling back and forth, Yu Genxiang shot diagonally from the west corner, taking the first point for Fudan. Chen Zongqi, a Jiangwan athlete, made a comparable shot, and Zhang Wen succeeded without falling behind, taking the lead with 4-2. Afterwards, both sides showed their skills, and the record board increased simultaneously, forming an undulating situation. After the tie at 12-12, Black Eagle showed their mighty power, and Zhang and Kong found opportunities on both sides, taking the lead with 18-12.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Black Eagle Takes the Lead <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>In this situation of coercion, the Fudan troops calmly responded to the battle. The generals Zhou, Qiu, and Chen worked together, attacking and defending, using the east-west probing strategy, so that the eagle had wings and could not spread its wings, and the score jumped up. It also evolved into a double flower of 20 to 20. Suddenly, Kong Guangyi and others were under the basket, and Zhang Yucai secretly crossed the Chencang, and in an instant, they took the lead again with 26-20, and then rested.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Main Player Fouled Out <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>When the battle started again, the fighting between the two sides was even more fierce. Fudan was determined to reverse the situation, and the eagle was equally unwilling to give in. The two generals, Kong and Zhang, guarded their homes, presenting an extremely stable situation. The two Zhangs in the front were able to do as they pleased, and the score went straight up. The opponent Fudan was in chaos in the army, and Zhou Dayun was fouled out, which greatly affected the strength.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Fierce Chase Ineffective <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>However, Fudan was more careful due to the retirement of the generals, and the battle situation became more tense. However, the actions of both sides were still very clear and admirable, without any dragging. In the last five minutes, Fudan's Chen and forward Fu reported one after another, chasing to 34-31, with only three goals difference. Unfortunately, time passed quickly, and the game was over in an instant. With the sound of the gong, the Black Eagle won 48-36.</p>

<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers' School in Jiangwan is a well-equipped physical education school in Shanghai. The facilities, sports equipment, etc., are all complete. In recent years, swimming has become increasingly popular, but there are not many public or private sports organizations in Shanghai that have swimming pools. In view of this, the school specifically purchased more than ten acres of land behind the school in Jiangwan last year. In addition to dedicating part of it to sports fields, the rest will be used as a base for building a swimming pool. After several preparations, the drawings have now been completed and bidding for construction has begun. The pool is designed to be extremely perfect, with a magnificent appearance and exquisite interior. Once completed, it will be the only complete swimming pool in Shanghai. According to the school authorities, construction of the pool will begin soon, and it is expected to be completed around mid-May, just when the weather is getting warmer and swimming is popular. The school's students are even more eager to succeed as soon as possible to show off their skills.</p>

<h3 id="e221">The General Assembly of the National Central University Alumni Association is Postponed <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Reported Branches Do Not Meet the Legal Number of Units</p>
<p>The Meeting Resolved to Postpone it to the Spring Break</p>
<p>The National Nanga, Dongda, and Central University Alumni Association, following the recommendations of 315 members including the Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuhan, Jinan, Kunshan, Jinhua, and Hangzhou branches, as well as members Zhou Bangdao, Chen Shizhen, Zhang Tingxiu, Zhang Su, Zhang Zhongfan, Ou Jifu, Xie Linshu, Fu Guanglin, Sun Guangyu, and Liu Zonglie, changed the system from a general membership meeting to a system of representatives from local branches. After deliberation by the Executive Committee of the association, a communication method was used to generally solicit the opinions of most local members, who expressed their support. It was decided to hold a temporary representative meeting of local branches on February 9th and 10th to discuss everything. All branches were also notified that they should elect representatives to attend the meeting in accordance with the established procedures before February 31st and report to the meeting. Since the meeting date was approaching very closely, only seven branches had reported. There are 37 branches that have been formally established, and 15 more are in the process of preparation and reorganization. In terms of formal branches, the number of attending units will be less than one-fifth. In terms of the total of 52 branches mentioned above, it is less than one-seventh. In this situation, in order to take into account the rights and interests of all members and the overall development of association affairs, the association held an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee Standing Committee at 7:30 PM yesterday (5th), resolving to postpone the temporary representative meeting to the spring break period, April 4th and 5th, to be held in Nanjing. All branch representatives who have been elected are still valid, and those who have not been elected must still follow the previously established local branch procedures for selecting representatives and matters requiring attention ten days before the conference. It is heard that a quick letter has been sent to each branch and a public notice has been published in the newspaper. The association's meeting is postponed to April 4th and 5th, which coincides with the spring break period.</p>

<h3 id="e223">Liu Tingfang Raises Three Questions About the Ten Professors' Manifesto <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Simultaneously Expresses His Own Opinions</p>
<p>Advocates the Sinicization of Imported Education</p>
<p>｜Ten Professors Respond: No Background, Aiming to Revitalize the Nation｜Recently, Dr. Liu Tingfang, Vice President of Yenching University in Beiping and Editor of the Education Column of the Tianjin Dagongbao, visited Shanghai and visited the people who signed the "Ten Professors' Manifesto" to discuss the manifesto. The record of their conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>When the professors saw Mr. Liu visiting, they immediately asked him to express his opinions on the Ten Professors' Manifesto. Mr. Liu said that we have been old friends for many years, and now I will impolitely raise three questions first, requesting answers: 1) Does this Chinese-based cultural construction movement have a political background? 2) What attitude do you take towards the issue of cultural control? 3) What is the ultimate goal of this movement? I hope you can explain it simply so that I can answer inquiries from friends after returning north.</p>
<p>The professors replied: 1) Our Ten Professors' Manifesto is purely based on personal relationships. From an academic standpoint, we have expressed some common opinions of the ten of us. Not only does our action have no background, but it also does not represent the institutions served by the ten of us. However, since the manifesto was published, not only have leaders from all walks of life across the country expressed considerable sympathy and given us a lot of guidance, but the authorities have also given us an opportunity to develop freely because our movement is purely academic.</p>
<p>2) The Ten Professors' Manifesto is nothing more than expressing a foolish opinion based on the idea that everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country, asking the people of the country for guidance. This has absolutely nothing to do with the issue of cultural control. We believe that if we can gather experts from all over the country to discuss opinions on building a Chinese-based culture, come up with a result, and seek a way to revitalize the nation for everyone to refer to, it seems like a worthwhile thing to do. 3) Our ultimate goal is, of course, to revitalize the nation, that is, how to build a Chinese-based culture in order to achieve the revival of the Chinese nation. The Japanese often say that modern international warfare is a competition of national intelligence. We believe that not only is warfare like this, but the modern struggle for national survival is also the same. Therefore, our foolish opinion is that the construction of a Chinese-based culture is a work that cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu continued that he has been engaged in education for many years and is also a member of the Tomorrow Education Society. That education society advocates: 1) The original Chinese education should be further advanced to make it scientific and productive. 2) All foreign education should be Sinicized. The so-called Sinicization is to adapt to current needs and be constantly updated, not to go back to the old paper piles to make a living. 3) The education cause should gather ideas and benefit widely, and should not be monopolized by one faction. Because he has this view, he can generally agree with the Ten Professors' Manifesto. However, he said that since he believes in Christianity, he recognizes religion as part of culture and cannot exclude it. Moreover, there is a considerable need in the work of revitalizing the nation, but it should also be Sinicized. Finally, Mr. Liu also promised that after returning north, he would convey the meaning of the ten people to his friends in the north. It is heard that Mr. Liu has already returned to Beiping by taking the Pinghu through train that afternoon.</p>

<p>Formulates a Broadcasting Calendar Three Times a Week</p>
<p>At China and the West and Great China</p>
<p>In order to increase the knowledge of citizens, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has specially organized educational broadcasting, which is held three times a week. It is held at the China and the West Pharmacy radio station on Sima Road at 5 PM on Wednesdays and Thursdays and at the Great China radio station at 5 PM on Saturdays. The broadcasting calendar has been formulated and is held on schedule.

<h3 id="e225">The Chinese Science Society Held the Shanghai Alumni Congress Yesterday <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei, Wang Yunwu, and Others Gave Speeches</p>
<p>Ding Xielin Described the Improved Chinese Flute</p>
<p>There Were Also High-Class Music and Factory Gifts</p>
<p>The Chinese Science Society held the Shanghai Alumni Congress and the 24th Alumni Friendship Meeting at the International Hotel at 6 PM yesterday (6th). More than two hundred alumni and their families attended, and the hall on the second floor was completely full.</p>
<p>Celebrity Speeches The dinner started at 7 PM. After coffee was served, Chairman Cao Liangxia delivered the opening remarks. According to the program of the conference, there were three speakers and seven musical performances interspersed. Cai Jiemin spoke about the two characters 乙亥, describing the important events of the year 乙亥 in history, and from the meaning of the characters 乙亥, he talked about arithmetic machines, animals, and plants, quoting scriptures and classics, broadly and mixed with humor, making the audience laugh. Next, Wang Yunwu gave a speech entitled "Mr. Science," briefly saying that this person has twelve sons, including arithmetic, astronomy, geography, and chemistry, and also a youngest son called "Learning Management." The Commercial Press was destroyed by the national crisis of January 28th. Fortunately, this young gentleman was invited to help, and it was able to revive. He hoped that in the future, instead of holding deity parades and seeking bodhisattvas, it would be better to pick up Mr. Science and let the people recognize him, as he is indeed our good advisor.</p>
<p>Improved National Flute Next, physicist Ding Xunfu spoke about the improved Chinese flute, briefly saying that the improvement of the Chinese flute has three prerequisites: 1. The intervals must be accurate. 2. The range must be increased. 3. The price of the flute must be low. Foreign flutes use keys to open and close, using ten fingers, and the range is naturally large, but a good flute costs 500 yuan each, which is not a way to popularize folk music. Based on his research results, he has completed several types of flutes, including those in C, B, and A keys, those made of copper, those made of bamboo, those with an inner diameter of two centimeters, and those with an inner diameter of 1.8 centimeters. The range is so large that 32 to 36 notes can be blown out from the lowest to the highest note, that is, 3 octaves, and each octave has 12 notes including semitones. He also performed with three bamboo flutes on the spot.</p>
<p>Performance Entertainment The musical performances that evening were all performed by Shanghai's first-class musicians. Miss Bao Kezhen opened the performance with a piano solo, followed by a chorus by Ms. Kawakli, and Ms. Bai Yemu Gan. Su Xulin, a professor at the National Academy of Music, sang a solo, Miss Gao Lan played a piano solo, Ms. Huali Si sang a solo, violin expert Professor Hua played three pieces, and finally Professor Chen Nengfang from the National Academy of Music sang to close the curtain.</p>
<p>Manufacturer Gifts The manufacturers who gave gifts to the conference included Yuanyuan Weaving Company, Chinese Science Company, Commercial Press, China and the West Pharmacy, Tianchu MSG Factory, Chinese Chemical Industry Society, Family Industry Society, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Shanghai Sheep Milk Company, Apple Electric Company, and more than ten other companies, with a total of more than 2,000 gifts. Among them, such as Yuanyuan meal towels, Science Company hardcover notebooks, China and the West One Drop Fragrance, Chemical Industry Society Era Cream, Family Industry Society Butterfly Cream, and old-brand MSG were all very popular. The whole audience also drank sheep's milk together and smoked Platinum Dragon cigarettes, which was particularly characteristic.</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Children's Welfare Association Asks the National Government to Promulgate a National Children's Year as Soon as Possible <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>And Set April 4th as the Opening Date</p>
<p>Order All Provinces to Hold Large-Scale Celebrations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association believes that this year is the National Children's Year, but the National Government has not yet issued a clear order. Now that the Children's Day holiday is approaching, a large-scale celebration should be held uniformly throughout the country. Therefore, it has specially submitted a presentation to the Municipal Government, requesting it to forward it to the National Government to promulgate a clear order as soon as possible and to request the Ministry of Interior and Education to jointly formulate implementation measures. The original presentation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request to Promulgate a National Children's Year Case: This association previously, in order to arouse national attention to the promotion of children's welfare, suggested that the China Child Welfare Association present a request to the National Government to designate 1934 of the Republic of China as the National Children's Year. However, due to insufficient preparation, it was ordered to be held in 1935, while this city is still continuing to proceed separately with the will of Your Excellency. Now, it has been found that 1935 has already begun. Regarding the preparation for the National Children's Year, although it has been reported that the Ministry of Interior and Education have started planning, no clear order from the central government has been promulgated so far, causing the provinces and cities to wait and see and not know what to do. Even on the side of this city, although this association has jointly formed a National Children's Year Preparatory Committee with party and government agencies to preside over everything, it is unable to proceed due to the lack of an order from the central government. If it continues to be delayed, a year will easily pass and it will disappear invisibly, repeating the same mistakes as last year, which is contrary to the original intention of the government to promote children's welfare. In view of this, this association has submitted a resolution to the fifteenth standing committee meeting requesting Your Excellency to forward it to the National Government to promulgate this year as the National Children's Year as soon as possible and to designate Children's Day on April 4th as the opening date, ordering all provinces and cities to hold large-scale celebrations uniformly. It is reasonable to prepare a document and present it to Your Excellency for review and approval for forwarding, which is for the public convenience. Respectfully presented to Wu, Mayor of Shanghai, Pan Gongzhan, Standing Chairman of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association.</p>
<p>Request to Formulate Children's Year Measures as Soon as Possible Case: This association previously, in order to arouse social attention to the promotion of children's welfare, specially suggested that the China Child Welfare Association present a request to the National Government to designate 1934 of the Republic of China as the National Children's Year. However, due to insufficient preparation, it was ordered to be postponed to 1935, while this city is still proceeding separately with the will of Your Excellency. Now, it has been found that 1935 has begun for more than a month. Although it has been reported that the implementation of the National Children's Year has been jointly prepared by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior, no concrete measures have been promulgated in clear orders so far. This association is deeply afraid that it will be delayed again and repeat the same mistakes as last year. Therefore, it dares to request Your Excellency to forward it to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior to quickly issue clear orders for the implementation measures of the National Children's Year in various provinces and cities, instructing them to comply. For the convenience of implementation in various provinces and cities, this association has also compiled and edited a book entitled "Implementation Methods of the Chinese Children's Year," which details the undertakings that should be carried out during the Children's Year and their methods, for the reference of various provinces and cities during implementation. In addition to sending it to the education bureaus of various provinces and cities, ten more copies are specially prepared and respectfully request that they be separately stored and forwarded to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior for review, ordering various provinces and cities to adopt them in order to broaden publicity and benefit the proceedings. Respectfully presented to Wu, Mayor of Shanghai, Pan Gongzhan, Standing Chairman of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association.</p>

Now, Mr. Huang, aspiring to further his studies, is scheduled to depart for Japan today aboard the Chichibu Maru, specializing in fine arts. He plans to study for two years, focusing particularly on cartooning styles during his studies, with the aim of contributing to the Chinese cartooning community upon his return.</p>

<p>Zhaohe Middle School: Zhaohe Middle School, located at the intersection of Robert's Road and Binlang Road in West Shanghai, has been vigorously renovated and reorganized since Mr. Yang Xiaotian became the headmaster. Newly hired faculty and staff are mostly well-known figures in Shanghai's education circles. In recent days, new student enrollment has been extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that the school is scheduled to hold student registration from the 2nd to the 10th of February, with classes beginning on the 11th. It is also reported that the school's final new student examination will be held on the 10th.</p>
<p>Minsheng Elementary School: Minsheng Elementary School, with over twenty years of history, has now begun its semester. A commencement ceremony was held at 9 AM on the 1st, attended by over two hundred faculty and students, creating a lively atmosphere. After Principal Hu delivered a speech, Academic Dean Wang reported on the academic performance of each subject in the previous semester and the teaching guidelines for this semester. The meeting adjourned at approximately 10 AM, and commencement guidance was then held in each classroom. It is reported that the school will officially begin classes immediately, and there are still vacancies in each grade.</p>
<p>Municipal Nanxun Elementary School: The Municipal Nanxun Elementary School has been established for over ten years. Although it has changed principals several times, it has been managed diligently, and school affairs have been steadily improving. However, the school building at Xuejia浜 Fengji Wharf Street was quite old and cramped, with little room for expansion. Therefore, the school has moved entirely to Tongxing Li on Bansongyuan Road this semester. The school building is spacious, the environment is elegant, and great efforts have been made to improve all aspects of education and instruction. It is reported that over two hundred new students applied to the school this semester.</p>
<p>Huahai Vocational Middle School: Huahai Vocational Middle School, due to the difficulty of development at its original location in the center of the concession, has recently moved to a Western-style building on Yaozhu Jiao Road. The school's new location is in West Shanghai, with a large campus. All departments have now been set up, and basketball and tennis courts are under construction. It is reported that the school has admitted quite a few new students in its first enrollment, and the number of applicants for the second enrollment is even more enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Huadong Girls' Middle School: Huadong Girls' Middle School on Beile Road has already begun classes. Currently, there are vacancies in the first-year spring term and the first, second, and third-year autumn terms of junior high school, the first, second, and third-year general courses of senior high school, the first and second-year business courses, and all grades of Huaguo Elementary School, Elementary School, and Kindergarten.

<h3 id="e232">General Evaluation Report of the National Labor Exhibition (2) <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>(1) The mowing machine, confluence pump, and vertical pump from Hubei Provincial Third Middle School. This school is an engineering-focused middle school, and it is commendable that it can manufacture such machinery. However, the workmanship is somewhat rough, and the materials are not very refined.</p>
<p>(2) The horse-powered water lifter, steam engine, hand-cranked water suction pump, and foot-operated water lifter from Jinan Junior Vocational School. The horse-powered water lifter has a clever design, but the workmanship is somewhat rough and should be improved. The same phenomenon applies to the other items. Students should be earnestly urged to strive for precision and quality materials to cultivate good habits.</p>
<p>(3) The vertical pump, four-foot single bed, pendulum pump, centrifugal dryer, and a set of wheel milling machines from Beijing Municipal Senior Vocational School. The pendulum pump and centrifugal dryer are well-made and very practical. However, the style of the lathe is somewhat old. Students' creative abilities should be earnestly guided in terms of design, and attention should be paid to accuracy during work.</p>
<p>(4) The 18-inch shaper, vertical drill press, and band saw from the Senior Industrial Vocational Department attached to the Hebei Provincial Institute of Technology. The machine forms are good, and the precision and materials are very sophisticated. It is rare for school products to be so excellent.</p>
<p>(5) The six-foot lathe, vertical drill press, hand-cranked drill press, and soap press from Baoding Senior Vocational School of Hebei Province. It is already not easy for vocational school students to manufacture such machinery. However, if students can pay close attention to the precision of research, the selection of materials, and the heat treatment of important steel parts, it will be even more perfect.</p>
<p>(6) The mechanical wood lathe, six-foot American-style lathe, bench lathe, rolling machine, small steam engine model, centrifugal suction pump, kerosene engine, circular saw, planer, and miscellaneous machine parts from the China Vocational School. The mechanical parts diagrams and implementations are displayed in comparison, which deeply reflects the intention of the exhibition and demonstrates the school's effective teaching. However, after examining the entire machine, it seems that the design of the mechanical wood lathe lacks robustness. Considering the excessive size of the tailstock screws and carriage of the six-foot American-style lathe, it is difficult to approach the headstock. If the hardness of the planer's blades and rollers can be increased, it will be more practical and durable. The circular saw and vertical drill press have excellent styles and exquisite workmanship, making them rare pieces of machinery.</p>
<p>(7) A set of screws and a set of pliers from the Second Vocational School of Hebei Province in Baoding, along with a complete set of parts and tools. It is very suitable to use small tools as teaching materials for schools. If steel materials can be selected and given appropriate hardness, and if large-scale manufacturing methods are promoted, it will be even more perfect.</p>
<p>(8) Gears, square screws, square anvils, calipers, scribers, and wrenches from Ningbo High School of Zhejiang Province. It is a special feature of the exhibition to have such works from high school students. Among the exhibits, the gears, scribers, and small anvils are well-made, and the other items are also impressive.</p>
<p>(9) A kerosene engine, centrifugal water suction pump, and small mechanical models from the Senior Industrial Vocational School代辦 by the College of Engineering of National Zhejiang University. The many mechanical models are cleverly constructed and precisely crafted. Having students practice making these kinds of machines deeply reflects the essence of teaching.</p>
<p>(10) A set of tools, spur gears, bevel gears, and generator models from Hunan Provincial Senior Vocational School. Each item is well-made, allowing students to practice designing various gears and learn how to manufacture gears, which is deeply meaningful for education. The tool-making is also original.</p>
<p>(11) A steam engine model, lead screw and lead screw quick return motion governor model, and elliptical gear wood model from the engineering department of Hunan Private Chuyi Middle School High School. The displayed items are all essential components of mechanisms and can be used for the study of machine operation. Students have both mechanical theory and practical work experience, which is highly commendable.</p>
<p>(12) A complete set of tools and saws from Hunan Provincial Fourth Vocational School. Each item is beautifully styled, appropriately hardened, and deeply practical. It is quite appropriate to use small tools as teaching materials for student practice.</p>
<p>(13) A set of pliers, shears, axes, and saws from Hunan Provincial First Vocational School. The workmanship is still good. If students can pay attention to materials and heat treatment, it will be even more perfect.</p>
<p>(14) A complete set of pliers, shears, and cutting tools from Hunan Provincial Third Vocational School. The style is still good. If appropriate hardness can be added and students are given instructions on mass production methods, the results will be even greater.</p>
<p>(15) A vertical drill press and two vises from Hubei Provincial Third Middle School. The hand-cranked vertical drill press seems to lack robustness. The two vises are suitable for practical use. It is hoped that students will be earnestly guided to pay more attention to creativity and materials, which will be even more perfect.</p>
<p>(16) A flat vise, scale, wooden mechanical parts model, lathe model, hand chisel model, hat nail penalty copper sheet sample, etc., from Fuzhou Industrial Vocational School of Fujian Province. Among the exhibits, there are several sets of student-collected lathe tool styles, screw screws, and screw caps, which are well-organized. It is very suitable to use them as teaching reference materials, but the achievements of student assignments are still inadequate.</p>
<p>(17) Sample pieces from Guangdong Provincial First Vocational School. Although the production is not very exquisite, it is deeply rooted in the essence of teaching to have students practice with this kind of teaching material.</p>
<p>(18) wheat machine, thresher, soldering iron, and iron from Shanxi Private Mingxian Middle School. The displayed items are all necessary for rural areas, which is truly the only weapon for developing the Northwest today. It is hoped that students will be earnestly enlightened in the future regarding creativity and how to make products cheap and of high quality to compete with foreign goods. (19) A vise and external calipers from Anhui First Secondary Vocational School. The displayed items are well-made. If research can be added to the selection of materials and the treatment of hardness, they will become even more perfect.</p>
<p>(20) Vises, lathes, oil engines, and water pumps from Anhui Private Vocational School. The displayed items are all practical. If attention can be paid to the precision of work and the appropriate selection of materials, they will be top-notch products.</p>
<p>(21) Two sets of axes and mallets from Jinan Junior Industrial Vocational School of Shandong Province. The style is beautiful, and the workmanship is exquisite. If attention is paid to the selection of materials and the adjustment of hardness, it can reach the top grade.</p>
<p>(22) Wooden molds and vises from Licheng County Junior Industrial School of Shandong. The vises are sturdy and durable, and the wooden molds are well-made, deeply rooted in the essence of teaching. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— (Reclining Buddha)</p>
<p>Some say: Youth is like a (spinning top), relying on their enthusiasm and courage, they are not afraid or slack in anything they do. When they reach middle age and gain a position of power based on their enthusiasm and courage, they transform into (abacus beads), only knowing how to calculate and seek advancement. By old age, enjoying their leisurely years and nurturing themselves in forests and springs, they no longer inquire about anything, becoming like (Buddha beads on a crown), merely ornamental. These three beads are a fitting portrayal of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>I often imagine this: the conscience of a traitor is utterly useless. If it could be extracted and implanted in the hearts of those who handle official matters, then those handling official matters, possessing a double dose of conscience, would surely achieve even better results. Similarly, bourgeois individuals always travel by boat or car, rendering their two feet completely useless. If those feet could be gifted to a group of lackeys, then with four feet, they would naturally be even more pleasing to their masters. There are many other such examples, but I cannot list them all. However, fantasies remain fantasies. Stubborn fate refuses to cooperate, so how can they be realized?</p>
<h3 id="e234">Superficial Talk <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Leanness and Refinement</p>
<p>Discussions of physiognomy are plentiful in ancient Chinese books and are hardly rare. During the Warring States period, there was a philosopher named Xunzi who advocated (rejecting physiognomy). (Gongsun Lü was said to have a face three feet long and three inches wide, yet his name moved the world.) Isn't that a bizarre appearance? I suspect there must be a typo. Perhaps (three feet) is a misprint of (one foot). Otherwise, even if such a visage existed thousands of years ago, wouldn't it terrify people? The Annals of Yanzi also state that (the face of Cheng Tang was rounded above and full below, and the face of Yi Yin was full above and rounded below.) According to this physiognomic interpretation, then Cheng Tang had a (由) character-shaped face, and Yi Yin had a (甲) character-shaped face. Simply by the size and shape of a person's face, their entire life's standing could be determined. Thus, the Zuo Zhuan records that (the inner historian Shu Fu said that Gu Ye's lower face was full, so he would surely have descendants in the state of Lu). The Guoyu also records that (Lu Shu Qiao Ru visited Zhou, and Wangsun Yue spoke with him, returning to tell King Jian that his appearance was square above and sharp below, suitable for offending people, and that the king should not reward him). The Book of Wei states that (Gu Bi's head was pointed, and Emperor Shizu jokingly called him "Pen Tip." At the time, everyone directly called him "Duke Pen"). The Biography of Li Anmin in the Book of Qi states that (Emperor Ming saw that Anmin threw five dice and all came up as "Lu," greatly alarming him. The Emperor said to Anmin, "Your face is as square as a field, a sign of being ennobled." (田) character-shaped face, now commonly called a square face, is perhaps the most perfect facial appearance in physiognomy. During the Three Kingdoms period, (Sun Quan had a square jaw and a large mouth.) It is said that his mouth could hold a fist, which his father Jian considered remarkable, deeming it an auspicious sign. That is the meaning!</p>
<p>In reality, in judging a person's face, skilled physiognomists always look for a rectangular shape, the so-called (同) character-shaped face, which is the most wealthy and noble configuration. If a person's outward appearance is roughly the same, but the cheekbones on either side are unusually prominent, then according to this diagram, it resembles the (風) character. Legal scholars say that prisoners who are imprisoned often have this appearance. There are also shapes like the (周) character, which is the worst of evil appearances because only one side protrudes, creating a malformed (周) character's (　). Look! Isn't that a monster? Therefore, scientists can use the angle of the facial bones to set standards when observing people's faces. People's intelligence is mostly uneven, but measuring their dimensions is accurate without the slightest error. The ancients said, (People's hearts are as different as their faces.) This is truly correct! In the book Gui Er Ji, (it is recorded) that the governor of a prefecture had a large and broad face, and he was posthumously named (西) character (face). It can be seen that facial features are not constant and ultimately not kind. Twenty years ago, someone inscribed Yuan Shikai's portrait with a (bear) face, Duan Qirui's portrait with a (swan) face, Huang Xing's portrait with a (pig) face, and Li Yuanhong's portrait with a (cow) face. They were not necessarily similar, but criticizing him was insulting to a great man, which was also unacceptable. Why? Comparing human faces to animal faces, those who have studied can always understand that Zhuge Jin of the Three Kingdoms had a (donkey) face, and Wei Ting of the Tang Dynasty had a (tiger) face, and there were even (monkey) faces and (dog) faces. If I were to list examples, humph! There are truly many!</p>

<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>In the still winter night air, the urgent sound of a siren suddenly transmitted. The sounds of people on the street also gradually changed from stillness to liveliness, and from liveliness to clamor.</p>
<p>The cries of (Fire | Fire | Fire |) were especially sent into the auditory organs of every person from the clamorous air. As a result, the residents of the entire street and the alleys on both sides hurriedly and frantically left their warm beds, rushing out to the door, shivering while inquiring where the fire was. Everyone's heart was filled with the hope that (the fire is still far away, it won't burn my house).</p>
<p>Thick white smoke violently spewed out from the doors and windows of a small grocery store at the entrance of the alley. The intense smell of burnt cloth filled the street and alley. The small grocery store, as well as the neighbors on either side of the small grocery store, were distraught, carrying out their boxes and belongings. The onlookers stared blankly. The hooligans were very active, trying to seize the opportunity to grab things. The police were maintaining order, waving their batons and hitting people indiscriminately. White smoke also began to rise from the roof of the small grocery store.</p>
<p>Amidst a tense wave of sound, the fire truck arrived. Firefighters wearing copper helmets jumped off the truck, connected the hose to the water hydrant, and the water drilled into the small grocery store like three giant snakes. In less than five minutes, the white smoke stopped seeping out from the gaps of the small grocery store. As a result, the sounds of people on the street gradually quieted down from the clamor.</p>
<p>The three giant python-like streams of water were still constantly drilling into the small grocery store. The crowd watching the excitement gradually dispersed, returning to their beds that had not yet cooled down to relive their good dreams.</p>
<p>The next day, anyone who passed by the door of the small grocery store would have to poke their head out to take a look at the remaining charred husk of the house. The boss with a round face deeply engraved with wrinkles, and the proprietress with a pair of very moving eyes, who knows where they have drifted.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Remote Place, Carefree Officials Arrive with Strong-willed Mandates; Splendid Hall, Grand Banquet, Outside, Pitiable Creatures</p>
<p>A half-moon in the sky, in the deep blue night sky, sent some green light to the ground. At the corner of the wall, there were two shadows huddled together. At first, Jie Fu didn't pay much attention, seeing a thin stick tree, stretching half of it on the yellow soil wall, just this tree, shining in the moon, matched with the ancient roof, was another kind of flavor. Jie Fu, after all, had drunk a little ink, and suddenly the thought of home arose spontaneously. He recited Tang poetry loudly, saying; I pity my young children from afar, not understanding the longing for Chang'an. His poetic inspiration broke out, but it frightened the two people at the corner of the wall. With a "Oh," a person's shadow flashed, as if almost falling down. Jie Fu then understood that there were two women. Like Little Western Paradise, every time it reached this beginning of nightfall, there was a batch of pitiful women, looking for a temporary way out here. Naturally, there were also those who knew that eating was important, and that shame was not unnecessary, so they did not dare to blatantly look for guests, but secretly hid and flashed, waiting for the waiter to come out and pass on the message. Zhang Jie Fu guessed that they were also this kind of people, and laughed: This is not worth being startled, wow. Who are you waiting for here? I'll send a message to him and let him come out. It's also very cold under the moon, don't catch a cold. As he said this, his footsteps kept moving over. In his heart, he thought that these women were nothing, and it was something the guests of Little Western Paradise couldn't get enough of when speaking with them. But as he moved forward, the two women leaned against the wall, slowly retreating backward. Jie Fu laughed: Aren't you looking for guests of Little Western Paradise? I am too. Why..." He said, already very close, and he could see clearly that the woman in front was Zhu Yueying, and the one behind had a bun on her head. Only then did he feel rash, how could he joke with people like this. (One Two Eight)</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As for the reason for the discord between Empress Jiashun and Empress Dowager Cixi, it is recorded very clearly in Hu Sijing's "Guowen Beicheng." One passage says: (The establishment of Empress Yi (i.e., Jiashun) was decided by Empress Dowager Ci'an, not by Xiaoqin (i.e., Cixi). After Ci'an's death, Xiaoqin became even more fond of Concubine Hui (the concubine was the daughter of Fengxiu; Cixi wanted to establish her when Tongzhi selected his consort but was unsuccessful). She instructed the emperor to treat her with extra courtesy and not to visit the central palace often. Emperor Muzong (i.e., Tongzhi) heavily defied the wishes of both empress dowagers, always sleeping alone in the palace, feeling depressed and unhappy. Evil people then tempted him to visit the people. The empress once wrote the two characters (戒嬉), "admonish against frivolity," and posted them in the corner of her seat to advise Muzong, which was known throughout the country as her virtue. When Muzong was on the verge of death, the empress entered the palace to inquire about his illness, but Xiaoqin resented that she had not reported to her first, severely reprimanding her. The empress angrily said, (I entered through the Great Qing Gate in a phoenix-drawn chariot, which the whole world knows. Now I enter the palace to inquire about the emperor's illness. What crime have I committed to be questioned by the empress dowager?)! Xiaoqin suspected that the empress was intentionally criticizing her, and she loudly rebuked her, saying: "You wench, do you think I have never entered the Great Qing Gate? You entered through me; how do you know you won't exit through me!)! When Muzong died, she did not establish an heir for him, forcing her to commit suicide.) This passage is generally reliable. Therefore, it is specially extracted so that readers, after reading it and then reading the following text, will not be without a clue.)</p>
<p>(The suffering we endured is truly beyond words!) The Empress Dowager continued, (Because of the matter of propriety, we had to endure until she herself sought a short death. Only then did we feel relieved as if we had seen the light of day again!)</p>
<p>That's right, everyone knows that the death of Empress Tongzhi was indeed a suicide, so the Empress Dowager herself believed that there was no need to hide it any further. Furthermore, I also heard people say that because the Empress Dowager was usually dissatisfied with Empress Tongzhi, she deliberately satirized her after Tongzhi's death, saying that a truly virtuous wife should have died with her husband and should not have lived on. As a result, Empress Tongzhi could not help but die. (Translator's note: Cixi forced Empress Xiaozhe to die with all her might, not just with cold irony and sarcasm. Fei Xingjian (Cixi's Biography True Record) records it in detail. The general idea is: Cixi once publicly humiliated Xiaozhe at the funeral and even slapped her face. The empress left, and that night, she hanged herself.) (Two Three Eight)</p>

<p>After reading Jiao Xin Jun's (Vegetable Prices After the Famine), a scene of profound tragedy replayed in my mind. One year of hard work, a year of famine inevitably leads to escape. I will record below what I felt and wrote in my diary a month ago. This is the voice of the Liyang farmers, perhaps it can supplement the Spring and Autumn Annals?</p>

<h3 id="e239">A Lone Visit to the Fragrant Sea Pavilion at Chao Mountain <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Fang'an</p>
<p>Not many days ago, at the home of Wu Changshuo's son, Dong Mai, in Jiqing Lane, North Shanxi Road, I unexpectedly encountered the abbot of Bao Ci Temple from Chao Mountain, the Venerable Guang Zhou. He told me that the Fragrant Sea Pavilion, which had been destroyed by fire, had recently been completed, thanks to Mr. Xi Guansheng of Panyu's fundraising and labor. It was finished just before the plum blossoms and snow began to compete for spring. The next morning, I met Venerable Guang Zhou again at Mr. Yao Chuqin's residence. He said that because of the mild weather these past few days, the faint fragrance from the branches near the water's edge would soon be wafting in the air. This piqued my interest in exploring the plum blossoms at Chao Mountain.</p>
<p>That day happened to be a Sunday holiday. I boarded the Shanghai-Hangzhou train at the North Station at 9:15 in the morning. Around 2 PM, the train delivered me to Linping. I jumped off the train and walked to the bus station on Hangtang Road.</p>
<p>The bus on Hangtang Road took me to Chao Mountain in less than twenty minutes. This was a familiar path to me. I entered Turtle Mountain West Village and climbed the mountainside of Snake Mountain. Along the way, I listened to the strangely pleasant local accent. Before I knew it, I had arrived at the Song Plum Pavilion.</p>
<p>In front of Bao Ci Temple, beside the Song Plum Pavilion, it was very quiet and desolate. There were no other tourists and no villagers. The Fragrant Sea Pavilion had indeed been restored to its former appearance, and it seemed even more solemn and serene than before. I wandered alone for a long time. The Song Plum, with its old branches stretching sideways, having endured all kinds of weather, was like an old monk in meditation, not even the branches moving. Looking closely through the fence, I could indeed see a few six-petaled flowers blooming on the branches. The flower buds, waiting to open, were scattered like stars. The newly transplanted old plum tree opposite seemed even more flourishing. A faint breeze occasionally carried a hint of fragrance. I imagined that at dusk when the moon rose, the scene would be even more enchanting.</p>
<p>I stepped into the lower level of the Fragrant Sea Pavilion and spent a lot of time climbing the stairs and gazing into the distance. I couldn't help but recall my long-held wish to point at the peaks and buy a mountain to live in seclusion. Turning back, I saw that the east wing of Bao Ci Temple, which had been destroyed, had also been restored to its former appearance. Who could say that this wasn't Venerable Guang Zhou's grand aspiration come true?</p>
<p>However, Venerable Guang Zhou had not yet returned to the mountain. I was too lazy to deal with the guest master at the temple. In the twilight, I bid farewell to the Fragrant Sea Pavilion and boarded the last bus on Hangtang Road, staying overnight in my hometown.</p>
<p>The next morning, I returned to Shanghai. I passed by Chao Mountain again along the way, but the beautiful scene flashed by in an instant!</p>

<h3 id="e240">Cotton Yarn Sales in Shanghai for the Third Year of the Republic <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Total Sales Amounted to 319,923 Bales</p>
<p>An Increase of 82,732 Bales Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>Attached: Comparative Table of Monthly High and Low Prices of Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>According to the actual sales of spot cotton yarn in the twenty-third year of the Republic, the total sales volume for the entire year was 319,923 bales, an increase of 82,732 bales compared to the 237,191 bales of the previous year. The reason for the increase is attributed to Japanese merchants being unwilling to cut prices and dump yarn, believing that the situation in North China was stable. Therefore, around June and July, the prices of Chinese yarn were particularly cheap in the north. The Tianjin, Gaoyang, Weihaiwei, North China, and Henan groups saw a large increase in the sales of coarse yarn, mostly 10-count and 17-count yarn. Tianjin's total transaction volume for the year was 28,803 bales, a large increase of 28,473 bales compared to the previous 330 bales. The North China group's total transaction volume was 10,725 bales, an increase of 9,510 bales compared to the previous year's 1,221 bales. Henan's transaction volume was 12,873 bales, with no transactions in the previous year. The Southern Guangdong and Yunnan groups saw an increase in sales due to lower prices. Guangdong's total transaction volume for the year was 64,881 bales, an increase of 17,706 bales compared to the previous year's 47,174 bales. Yunnan's transaction volume was 26,572 bales, an increase of 6,795 bales compared to the previous year's 19,777 bales. The inland's total transaction volume for the year was 74,455 bales, a large increase of 28,553 bales compared to the previous year's 45,902 bales. Hunan and Jiangxi saw a slight increase in sales due to the victory in bandit suppression. However, Sichuan was severely affected by rampant banditry, with exchange rates soaring to 1,500 yuan, greatly impacting yarn sales. Not only did sales not increase, but they actually decreased significantly. The total transaction volume for the year was only 24,993 bales, a large decrease of 17,944 bales compared to the previous year's 42,937 bales. The transaction volume for January was 17,636 bales, February was 11,390 bales, March was 13,680 bales, April was 26,376 bales, May was 37,235 bales, June was 23,166 bales, July was 26,056 bales, August was 32,350 bales, September was 35,858 bales, and October (the peak transaction month) saw increased activity by customer groups due to news of increased consolidated taxes from the Ministry of Finance, with 40,681 bales. November was 32,368 bales, and December was 23,127 bales. The following is a list of the annual purchase amounts for each group (for reference):</p>

<h3 id="e241">American Cotton Market in Stagnation Pending Resolution of Gold Bar Embezzlement Case <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with quiet trading and prices down 1-2 points. Subsequently, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, some long positions were liquidated and foreign merchants sold, causing prices to continue to decline. Midway, due to limited selling, fellow traders bought in, resulting in a slight rebound. However, the stock market remained sluggish and local traders sold, preventing any significant improvement. At the close, short covering led to a relatively stable situation. Spot prices were down 5 points, while futures prices for all months except October were down 2-5 points. Currently, cotton markets across the United States are in a state of stagnation, awaiting the resolution of the gold bar embezzlement case. The British cotton market was weak due to selling from Bombay traders, with spot prices down 3 points and futures unchanged. The Indian cotton market initially strengthened due to buying from European exporters and Japanese merchants, but later retreated due to the liquidation of large long positions. Phalgool was down 1.5 rupees, Oomra was down 2 rupees, and Broach was down 0.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 29th).</p>

<p>Gold Market and Chinese Banks Still Closed for Holiday</p>
<p>Western Merchants Lack Spot Silver, Forcing Down Forward Prices</p>
<p>Dalian Banks Sell Off Gold Futures Contracts at Lower Prices in the Black Market</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London spot and forward prices both fell by 1/8, New York silver prices also dropped by 1/8, and forward silver prices in Montreal fell by varying amounts of 2.5 to 3.5 percent. London pure gold fell by 3 pence, British pounds versus US dollars unchanged, US dollars versus British pounds rose by 0.25, British pounds versus French francs rose by 3 pounds, US dollars versus French francs unchanged. At the morning opening, the recent selling price for British exchange was 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 3/8 (0.375), and for American exchange was 35.375 yuan, which was tighter by 0.0625 for British and 0.125 for American compared to the previous close. However, immediately after opening, the market strengthened. The Central Bank's official rate announcement showed a tightening of 0.125 for British and 0.1875 for American exchange. The customs gold unit rose by 0.011 (yuan). Although Cheng Feng Yong and others were buying, the banks' supply had little impact. The HSBC announced its official rate with both British and American exchanges unchanged. Later, Sassoon began selling spot shillings, and thereafter banks suddenly started large-scale selling, causing the market to strengthen further. Although the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, foreign banks lacked spot silver and Chinese banks were still closed for the holiday, while the gold market was also closed. As a result, there was a lack of support, and spot prices were driven up while forward prices weakened. The domestic market repeatedly loosened, and even though the Jewish merchant, George Joe, came to buy, the banks' selling interest was still strong, and the situation at noon remained unfavorable. Although the American Eastern Bank took delivery, it had no impact, and the afternoon market remained strong. The initial Indian silver price rose by 7.3 annas, but after entering the market, banks began to sell again, while the Dalian Savings Company also took delivery, resulting in a flat market. Although the second Indian silver price rose by 3.1 annas, it slightly softened in the end. The closing selling prices for recent contracts were 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 13/16 (0.8125) for British exchange and 36.25 yuan for American exchange, which was looser by 0.375 for British and tighter by 0.6875 for American compared to the previous close. Some Chinese merchants, such as Cheng Feng Yong and Sheng Da, were buying slightly, while the Dalian banks and savings companies sold off gold futures contracts, with black market prices ranging from around 958 to 951 yuan, eventually settling above 3 yuan. Shilling February contracts were sold forward to March contracts, with the Korean bank paying the Dalian banks 3.125. Today's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e244">After Resolution of the US Gold Bar Case Regarding Silk and Tea <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Sales of Raw Silk Will Inevitably Increase</p>
<p>According to reports, the US gold bar case will be postponed until February 12th for sentencing. Currently, the atmosphere in New York's financial and industrial sectors remains turbulent, and the outlook for the silk market is difficult to predict. Therefore, the Shanghai market situation remains sluggish. However, according to a Westerner, the verdict of the gold bar case, regardless of who wins or loses, is irrelevant. He only hopes for a quick resolution to dispel the lingering wait-and-see attitude in the market, allowing various transactions to become as active as before. Whether the government wins the case, its financial position will be strengthened, and the industrial sector can be at ease in their respective businesses. Conversely, the wise US government will surely have other effective ways to recover its losses. Some people say that there will be market turmoil after the verdict, but he said this is not credible. By then, the sluggish market atmosphere will have dissipated, and spring sales of raw silk both domestically and abroad will inevitably increase. Given the imbalance between supply and demand in the Chinese silk market, market prices may see an improvement as a result.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Problems Concerning the Relationship Between Literature and Science <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>I have already said a few words about this issue, but because someone has misinterpreted them, I am bringing it up again for discussion.</p>
<p>The presentation and resolution of every issue cannot be separated from concrete reality. Furthermore, in the process of presenting and resolving the issue, the main thing is to make the opinions more systematic. Blindly pulling and tugging is of no use. Regarding this issue, I believe that it should be presented and resolved from two aspects. One aspect is essential, elucidating the similarities and differences between literature (art) and science, and thus inferring what kind of relationship the two should have. The other aspect is more concrete, paying attention to the current situation in China and proposing how to realize the aforementioned relationship. By science, I mean both social science and natural science.</p>
<p>The first problem arises because people have always only noticed the differences between literature (art) and science, neglecting their similarities. That is, they only notice that art is emotional and science is rational, and therefore think that the two are unrelated or incompatible. They do not know that art, literature, and science are all powerful tools for humans to understand and transform reality, and all reflect the development of reality. Although artists and scientists each have different ways of expressing reality, in understanding reality, they have closely related and consistent methods (epistemology and its methodology). Therefore, here we find the essential basis for literature (art) to be closely linked with science. In the past, naturalistic writers used natural science to create artistic works, but they did not have the correct methods. As a result, although they obtained some excellent results, they also brought about huge failures, because they could not accurately understand the qualitative differences between human society and the natural world. They did not understand that (humans) are the sum total of social relationships, and only described them as animals in a gregarious setting. In the recent past and present, another group of writers simply applied the principles of social science to literature, fragmenting reality to fit into their narrow abstract concepts. As a result, they created a large pile of novel formulas, poetry formulas, and so on. Needless to say, this was caused by the incorrect grasp of creative methods. At the same time, we can also draw an important conclusion here, that the true (cooperation) between science (social science and natural science) and literature (art) absolutely does not mean the accumulation of academic knowledge, but rather means cooperation in understanding reality. That is to say, literature and science can only achieve a true sense of integration in the process of practice. Balzac received the (Social Science Doctorate) honor because he closely linked literature and science within a certain practical limit. Goethe, who was rich in natural science knowledge, had long said: (You can't know anything by just studying, you always need the necessity of practice.) The above words are my essential opinions on the mutual (penetration) of literature and science. Some people think that it is superfluous to propose this opinion, because it (seems to have been explained thoroughly enough in the past). However, I think this is necessary to prevent the essential meaning of the (mutual penetration) of literature and science from being ignored. If this meaning is neglected, true results cannot be obtained smoothly. And in fact, those who claim to be (thorough enough) are often not (thorough) at all. For example, (literature is the lower base of ideology), (literature is a department of social science) (both seen in this column on January 15), words like these may barely gain a seat when (odd articles are shared), but using ordinary (old sayings) to say it, it is (nonsense), and fundamentally does not understand what literature and science are and the essential meaning of their interrelationship.</p>
<p>The second question stems from the first question. Due to the obstacles of the private social system, literature and science have always been the exclusive property of a few people, and have never achieved true unity. Now that we have affirmed the important relationship between literature and science above, we should try to universalize both. Let me add a word here, limiting science solely to natural science, especially at the current stage, is completely failing to understand the true meaning of the mutual (penetration) of literature and science. This essentially ignores the importance of social science to China at the present stage. In his article (On Scientific Essays), Mr. Liu Shizhi gave many concrete explanations of this (penetration) problem. Now, essays have not only married science, but also given birth to sons. This trend can develop into the combination of literary science. I believe that in the near future, we will see works like Ilyin's (The Story of the Five-Year Plan), because this kind of work has its important social necessity at the current stage. In the process of promoting the true connection between literature and science, universalization or popularization is the most important and only means, but we cannot simply regard this as the entire meaning of the whole problem, and think that (the penetration of natural science and literature is not a matter of method, but a matter of the reason for the subject matter.) Because universalization is the (reasoning) method of the problem at the current stage, and it is also a matter of cultural education.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Discussing Poetry is Like Discussing Zen <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Wu</p>
<p>Poets often attribute the world to their own subjective views, and express their desires and emotions in life, forming the content of poetry. Although there may be various different schools in style, such as simplicity, elegance, sadness, and heroism, the pure Platonic thought and sentiment, as well as the expressed Passion, are the same. The poet's thought is philosophical, not belonging to the world of Aristotle, so in poetry there is often hidden a philosophical concept, a Zen machine. Reading ancient poems, we often sigh and ponder, like chewing olives, and this is why. For example, when we read:</p>
<p>(Sad falling leaves, fluttering down in layers. Layers. Layers fall and fly, going horizontally and never returning. The long shade of intertwined branches was once so dense? The yellow birds sing and lose each other. Evening medicine mixes with condensed frost, morning falls and turns to fly in the sun, chaotic spring sun, rises spring breeze, spring breeze and spring sun are the same at this time. One frost and two frosts can still be endured, five mornings and six days have already withered yellow. Suddenly, a gust of wind lifts them, soaring high and low. Sad falling leaves, when will the falling leaves return? They shared the same root in the past, but now they have no connection, each following the dust and dirt, and it is difficult to climb the high branches again. —Xiao Zong of the Northern Wei Dynasty, "Sad Falling Leaves.")</p>
<p>We can know that this is not only a work of Shu Zhi when Xiao Zong was frustrated, but also contains a philosophical exploration of life for one's own subjective purposes. This kind of subtle and distant Zen machine is hidden between chanting and sighing, and cannot be excavated. This sense of subtlety and distance that cannot be excavated is precisely the valuable part of poetry. Throughout history, there have been no shortage of great theorists of poetry. Although their arguments are not consistent, they seem to agree on focusing on (grasping the infinite).</p>
<p>In my opinion, the greatest theorist of poetry who thoroughly implemented this meaning throughout history was Yan Yu of the Song Dynasty. Yan Yu's Canglang Poetry Talk says: (Discussing poetry is like discussing Zen. The poetry of the Han, Wei, Jin, and High Tang dynasties is the first meaning; the poetry since the Dali era is small vehicle Zen. The poetry of the Late Tang Dynasty is the sound-heard Pratyekabuddha fruit. The masters of the High Tang Dynasty only focus on interest, like a antelope hanging its horns, with no trace to be found. Therefore, its subtlety is transparent and exquisite, impossible to approach, like sound in the air, color in appearance, the moon in the well, the image in the mirror, words are finite and meaning is infinite. Modern gentlemen make strange explanations, and then take words as poetry, talent as poetry, and discussion as poetry. How can they not be skillful, but they are ultimately not our poetry. For in the sound of chanting and sighing, there is a sense of regret.)</p>
<p>In this passage, he advocates that poetry should be like (sound in the air), (color in appearance), (the moon in the well), (the image in the mirror), which is the so-called pure Platonic thought and sentiment as well as the form of the expressed Passion. He opposes (taking words as poetry), (taking talent as poetry), and even (taking discussion as poetry). This kind of view is not only worthy of attention at that time, but also has its value when applied to modern times. We know that there are more people doing poetry of the kinds that Yan Yu would have opposed than can be counted. Among them, there are certainly those who play games with words, and it cannot be said that there are absolutely no people who flaunt their talents, and as for the great poets who claim to lead the masses and only know how to (make arguments), they are even too numerous to count. The greatest achievement of these kinds of poets is probably nothing more than oppressing the Muse with brute force and making the poetry scene deserted.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I have not forgotten to tell people not to be (poetry artisans). In other words, although the vernacular poems of Wang Fanzhi (Hanshan, Shide, Shao Yong) are rich in Zen, it is not appropriate to regard them as supreme treasures. Muddled-headed games should be respectfully avoided from the greatest differences.</p>
<h3 id="e253">The Celebrated Jumping Frog (Part 2) <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Mark Twain, Translated by Libo</p>
<p>Xi Xie Smilu had a mare—the children called her the Fifteen-Minute Mare, but, you know, that was just a joke. Naturally, she was faster than that—and he often won money on that mare, even though she was so slow, and often wheezed, was dizzy, had lung disease, or some other similar ailment. They always gave her two or three hundred yards, always passing her halfway through, but in the final, difficult stretch of the race, she would get very excited, looking like she was trying her hardest, jumping, her legs kicking wildly in the harness, sometimes high in the air, sometimes stepping on the garden walls, kicking up more and more dust. Her choking, sneezing, snorting, caused more and more clamor—you could see that he always reached the finish line a neck ahead.</p>
<p>He had a small, fierce dog. Looking at him, it seemed he wasn't worth a cent, except to lie there honestly, waiting for a chance to steal something. But when money was bet on him, he was different; his jaw began to protrude, like the forecastle of a steamer, and his teeth would glow like a stove. Another dog would tease him, threaten him, bite him, and even throw him over his shoulder two or three times. Andre Mackson—that was the dog's name—Andre Jackson wouldn't pretend, he was just content, he wouldn't hope for anything else—the bets on the opponent were doubled and redoubled until all the money was gone; then, suddenly, he would seize the other dog's hind leg, right at the joint, biting tightly—not tearing, you understand, just holding on tightly, until they called a truce, even if it took a year. Smilu always won betting on that little dog, until he tangled with a dog that had no hind legs, because that dog's hind legs had been sawn off with a circular saw. When the time was ripe, and all the money was bet, he went straight for that cherished leg joint. He immediately saw how he had been tricked, how he had fallen into the dog cage. He looked surprised, and soon he was very depressed, and he didn't want to fight this battle anymore. He was very agitated. He looked at Smilu as if to say his heart was broken, and it was all his fault, he didn't refuse to fight a dog without hind legs to seize, and seizing hind legs was his main reliance in battle. So he walked a few steps weakly, and lay down and died. That was a good little dog, that Andre Jackson, and if he were still alive, he would be famous, because he had that foundation, and he had talent—I know, if he didn't have talent, he would never have had the chance to be talked about, and his ability to fight like that in that environment is inexplicable. I always feel sad when I think of his last battle and its outcome.</p>
<h3 id="e254">My Factory Trip <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>Every year in the first and second months of the lunar calendar, in the misty mornings when the sun was just beginning to rise, groups of people, carrying small bundles and wearing tattered bamboo hats, their faces etched with the bitter sorrow of departure, would march out of the east gate of their hometown like a crusading expedition, heading to Gejiu, more than three hundred miles away, to work in the tin mines.</p>
<p>These people who went to work in the mines were mostly bankrupt farmers and unemployed individuals. When they left in the spring, they mostly looked like impoverished refugees. But when they returned at the end of the lunar year, it was a completely different story: they wore brand-new blue coarse cloth clothes, a small melon-shaped hat with a red knot on their heads, their clothes were half-open, their peach-red faces carried a hint of newfound wealth and pride, and they were even healthier than before. Seeing acquaintances, they were always smiling, as if they had done something triumphant. That sight always made me very envious!</p>
<p>Perhaps it was also because all my friends who used to hang out together had gone out, leaving me alone at home tilling the fields, which felt too monotonous? So I also wanted to go to work in the mines!</p>
<p>But this idea was always rejected by my father, who wore a bitter expression:</p>
<p>(I'm over fifty years old, what haven't I done? Work in the mines, do you think it's so easy? I used to work in the mines for many years—what good is it? I've said before: I won't even look at the Gejiu mines when I'm urinating or defecating, and you still want to go?)</p>
<p>My father was furious, and spittle flew from his toothless mouth. I knew what he meant. He hoped that I would be like him, honestly tilling the land for the rest of my life, and not have any extravagant illusions, because he had been through it all, he had tasted all the suffering in the world, and knew how fate was determined. But I, being stubborn, always refused to listen to my father. My heart had already been taken to Gejiu by those proud people who returned from Gejiu every year with their wealth. I wanted to go to that place of wealth—Gejiu!</p>
<p>So, I continued to idealize Gejiu. I imagined myself as a future boss, who would return on a magnificent horse when I became rich. At that time, my hard-working parents would no longer have to suffer other people's anger, and be tenants for others. At that time, we would build our own house, and no longer live in that broken earthen hut... These ideals strengthened my resolve without me realizing it. Although my father had told me what kind of place it was, and how dangerous it was, and that it was very easy to die in the mines at any time... I still insisted on going!</p>
<p>This stubborn determination left my father helpless. But in his heart, he thought that I was still so young, and even though I said I wanted to go, would I really go?</p>
<p>This was something they did not expect: one morning, when the golden sunlight had just kissed the roof ridge, while they were busy working and not paying attention, I quietly stole a tattered bamboo hat and followed an acquaintance who was going to Gejiu (to transport water) and slipped out of the house.</p>
<p>This was truly something no one knew. Tiptoeing behind him, all the way until we were about to get on the boat, the water carrier turned around and saw me, and, surprised, quickly put down his load, and said in an unusual tone:</p>
<p>(Ah, where are you going?)</p>
<p>(Gejiu!)</p>
<p>(You're going to work in the mines too?) The water carrier looked at me, so young and laughable, and couldn't help but laugh, mockingly saying to me: (Is all you need to work in the mines just this tattered bamboo hat?)</p>
<p>I was ashamed and didn't say anything. He came closer and grabbed me: (Go back, go back! ...You're still too young. Wait until you're older next year and then go...).</p>
<p>(No, I want to go this year!)</p>
<p>(Hey, is that a place for you to go?)</p>
<p>As he spoke, regardless of whether I cried or not, he tightly pinched my arm and sent me home like he was pulling a criminal.</p>
<p>This setback made me very sad. But the following year, under the pressure of merciless life, no one stopped me anymore, letting an ignorant eleven- or twelve-year-old child leave his hometown alone to a strange place, to taste the first bitter cup of life.</p>

<h3 id="e256">Small Pleasure Boat <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhaojia</p>
<p>In the winter, the setting sun slants into the deep purple mountain peaks. The young masters in the villages, who are already accustomed to a materialistic lifestyle, take out their pocket watches to check the time. They secretly stuff large amounts of money into their silk pockets, and hurry out of their own house gates, heading to the small pleasure boats moored beside the small river.</p>
<p>In that secluded place, not far from the village, three or four pleasure boats are moored. Inside the boats, there are songs and laughter. In the evening, the calm river surface gradually becomes agitated, stirring up endless joy and troubles for people.</p>
<p>The wealthy and amorous young men in the village secretly gather there, and in the midst of wild drinking and laughter, they all seem to lose their senses, forgetting the old master's intimidating beard at home, forgetting the old mother's red eyes, explaining everything to her husband on behalf of her son, and even forgetting their own moments of repentance, immersing themselves in the embrace of the pleasure girls.</p>
<p>The pleasure girls help the drunk guests into the back cabin. The guests hold the boat girls in their arms and drag them to a wooden bed covered with a mat, doing all sorts of different things. The boat girls don't show any impatience. Experience tells them that wealthy young masters have big tempers and are not easy to provoke. If they are served well, they will be rewarded generously.</p>
<p>When dusk arrives, that group of delirious people returns. Those who are drunk as mud are awakened with cold water by the boat girls. They stagger back into their own house gates and run back to their own rooms, forgetting the cold. Their minds are as if filled with mercury, dazed and confused. The old master's intimidating beard and the old mother's red eyes gradually creep back into their memories. Fortunately, there is only one such joyous occasion a year. They forgive themselves in this way, but after climbing into bed, they cannot sleep all night, tempted by the boat girl's slender figure and full, fleshy body! In the evening, the pleasure boats change to another group of people. Young, unmarried farmers, all holding boundless hopes, also sneak into the cabins, having all drunk old wine at home. They are preparing to spend a sweet winter night here.</p>
<p>The boat girls send away those young masters, because it is very dangerous to let a young master from a wealthy family spend the night on their boat. If the young masters' family finds them on their boat, that's not a joke. Not only will their boat be confiscated by the county, but they will also be severely beaten by the boat boss, because the wealthy old masters from those families have great influence and reputation. If they know that their sons have done such a thing, it would be terrible. Therefore, they investigate the guests who want to stay overnight in great detail. Because the farmers have no power and no reputation, the boat girls sleep with them in peace.</p>
<p>The pleasure boats spend the winter by the small river in the village. In the spring, they don't do business according to their rules, but sail elsewhere. They dock here again next winter. The pleasure girls on the boats are of course replaced with new ones, but they become more fashionable every year. Therefore, the new styles of women in the city are also brought to this lonely village every year.</p>
<p>Every year after the pleasure boats sail elsewhere, in the garbage dumps by the small river, one can see what they have left behind: a bloody thing wrapped in straw and mats, which are the premature babies born to the pleasure girls. When the river water rises to the beach in the spring, those things born to the pleasure girls are also washed away to other places along with the river water.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the secluded small river where the pleasure boats used to dock has been replaced by two or three bandit ships in the winter.</p>

<h3 id="e257">On Adapting to the Environment <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>According to biologists, all living things must adapt to their environment in order to survive. Even the green color of a small insect is to adapt to the green of the grass, in order to avoid being captured. As for humans, of course, they are no exception. However, since humans are known as the spirit of all things, they have more sophisticated skills and means to adapt to the more complex environment. We usually work day and night, living a common life like millions of others, but sometimes, the individual's will conflicts with the surrounding environment, and this is when a tragedy unfolds. Bergson said: We usually have two personalities, one is peaceful, retiring, and conservative, and the other is violent, reckless, and destructive. The former appears in our daily interactions, while the latter appears when the individual conflicts with society. If we examine ourselves, this is certainly not without reason. When grief and anger arise, one truly feels that although the world is vast, there is no place for oneself, or one looks around and feels that there is no one to talk to. Here, the lesson of adapting to the environment is needed.</p>
<p>Humans are inherently social animals, and cannot live a solitary life like Robinson Crusoe. All the people in society are closely related to oneself. In the past, many poets who claimed to be lonely said that they existed awake amidst the drunkenness of the masses, but they could not leave this so-called (drunken) society, could they? This is really comical upon careful thought. On the one hand, one hates the people around them, and on the other hand, one cannot truly isolate oneself from these people. As a result, one either loses others or others lose oneself. The ends of both paths are tragedy. Since we know that individualism is just a deformed attitude to life, since we know that human nature contains an innate sense of sociability, since we know that we cannot force society to follow oneself, then why not change our attitude, correct our own aloofness, and adapt to this society and improve this society? A passive attitude is not a good example to follow. It not only does not benefit society, but also makes one's own survival a problem. Complaining, being angry, and resisting will only result in irrational madness and be ridiculed by people as a fool. To put it bluntly, this is selling one's life cheaply!</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot deny that pure young people are often appalled by the dark and evil aspects of society. It is certainly uncomfortable at first to spend all day with people who eat meat and laugh, or to say "Nice weather today! Ha!!" when they meet, or to indulge in wine and mahjong. But over time, habit becomes second nature, and one gradually drowns in the murky current. Especially in our moderate, lukewarm, and viscous nation, within a few years, an energetic young person will be molded by the environment to be polite and restrained, with no fire, becoming the person they once hated. Adapting to such an environment is not easy!</p>
<p>But should we therefore escape? Society is treacherous, and life is rugged. Since we are born as human beings, we bear the responsibility of pioneering the way through hardship. I believe that the environment is a large crucible. Only by tempering oneself in it can one develop one's personality. As for those who adapt to the environment, they are simply those who are not reckless or evasive in their dealings with the world. The motto of the ancient philosophers is (Harmony without Uniformity)!</p>
<h3 id="e258">A Stroll in the Desert <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>(I hear that the dreams of those who travel in the remote African deserts every night are of the beautiful mountains and rivers of their homeland.</p>
<p>— Kume Masamura: Symbol of Anguish)</p>
<p>Also) At night, I dreamed of the beautiful hometown of my childhood, like a mythical fairy island.</p>
<p>(There, a mist-like poetic haze permeates—the mist carries the breath of the morning.</p>
<p>And so: every spring, the wild roses on the short fence in front of my house bloom, and the grapevines spread verdantly and windingly to endless lengths: from here, a trace of gentle emotion is read. The moon, night after night, presents itself with the appearance of an ancient mirror, illuminating the tranquility of this small village, illuminating all kinds of bright little dreams, illuminating much of the frankness of childhood. The water in the small stream flows like the floating of clouds, with boundless joy in its simplicity—it is the original form of the human world, and also the symphony of the bright melody of the flow of life.</p>
<p>One morning, one evening, people are accompanied by the low and quiet bell sounds of the small temple, tranquil and far-reaching: and so: like the stubbornness of an old goat, they fall into deep thought—people think about a star, a petal, a drop of stream water, a seed, a light cloud.</p>
<p>Worries? Terror? Torment? Hurt?</p>
<p>The terribleness of the human world is non-existent—perhaps they are hidden in an unknowable stratum.</p>
<p>The human world is eternally beautiful, like a cluster of fireworks.)</p>
<p>However, when I wake up, I realize once again: I have been deceived once more—deceived by a dream!</p>
<p>I am traveling alone in the African desert of the human world—an endless desert.</p>
<p>The land is barren, a thousand miles, ten thousand miles, without green grass or moist water droplets. Dirty sand flies in the wind, blinding people's eyes and suffocating their breath—in the desert, even the sun is seen as malicious and cruel.</p>
<p>Right? The desert has no boundaries. Lying in front of people is a vast expanse of sand: travelers walk and walk, but finally cannot help but begin to doubt what the journey in this desert itself represents.</p>
<p>To say that it is seeking a miracle in the human world; but who can believe such an implausible statement? — The wasteland of life is not comfortable like velvet — on the contrary, isn't it clearly filled with witheredness, dryness, harshness, and a thousand kinds of exploitative natural phenomena? What the traveler thrown into the desert asks for is not the glittering splendor of luxury, but some ordinary products of nature: a blade of green grass, a milky white lily, a dewdrop, a breath of moist air.</p>
<p>However, those who have been exiled to the wasteland of life are not allowed even this little hope.</p>
<p>Youth in the desert is like the salty, light breeze on the sea: and so, traces are carved on the traveler's face: they are old, but why do they still have to carry heavy luggage, pick up a dead branch as a cane, and limp step by step, never stopping?</p>
<p>To say that life has a legendary beauty is perhaps clever; however, the shadow etched in the heart of the traveler in the desert does not allow for any defense.</p>
<p>In this way, I will begin to learn to endure a more desolate state of mind from today onwards. When I know that I must remain in the desert for the rest of my life, why bother to remember the beauty of another world?</p>
<p>(The dreams of those who travel in the African desert every night are of the beautiful mountains and rivers of their homeland!)</p>
<p>But today, even this beautiful dream has disappeared.</p>

<p>— Luo Jia</p>
<p>Walking along the coal cinder road, the rows of holly trees lining the road, the December wind, is obviously brash. After being sick, my pace is a little bit sluggish.</p>
<p>The roots of a wax plum tree are just enough to make a seat for me. The rich fragrance of the wax plum is more intoxicating than mixed wine. I cannot bear such a nearly oppressive temptation. My throat itches, I am almost vomiting. Yes! I want to be quiet, I want to be detached. Anything that is too rich, too extravagant, too glorious is despised by me.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Cigarettes are my best friend. At dusk, the room is dark, the light is not on. Kissing its pure white body, sitting in a velvet-faced recliner, my thoughts are clear, clearer than the clear sky in autumn. There is not a trace of impurities here, and this is when I am at my most intelligent.</p>
<p>Afterward, I fall into inescapable error. Prejudice ferments in my heart. So, I despise women. Should women be slaves to sex? In order to show the greatness of their sexual instincts, they fully expose all their seductive powers, hoping that some stupid men, wanting to get a moment of pleasure, will willingly be used by them. This fully demonstrates their selfish desires and vulgar aspirations.</p>
<p>Therefore, I despise women.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>I feel that everything in the world is superfluous.</p>
<p>What I find most unbearable is music. That kind of disturbing</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>the sound of a still heart, should belong to one of the sins in the world.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>I am indifferent to any event, unable to muster a trace of interest, sitting quietly and meditating, like a monk in an ancient temple deep in the mountains.</p>
<p>Take two tablets of (Picric acid).</p>
<p>Wanting to write poetry, I get two lines. My stomach problems will forever hinder my poetic inspiration. Lately, it feels like I have woken up from a long dream, denying everything in life. For example, writing poetry, writing novels... are all equally boring and equally meaningless, because this is writing, and it also becomes a burden on the world in the same way.</p>
<p>Heaven has a will. Sitting up at night wrapped in blankets, my mind is blank. Indifferently, I will live like this!</p>
<h3 id="e260">Sailor Street <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Xin</p>
<p>Sailor Street, is also in a faraway, nostalgic foreign land. It's a very famous street in the bustling commercial area of Cho Lon in southern Vietnam. It's as long as Nanjing Road in Shanghai!</p>
<p>It's also the place where the most (Chinese) people gather! However, it's absolutely not like the (Chinatowns) in foreign lands that people generally describe, where foreign devils cover their noses as they pass by, showing disgust for the barbaric and filthy Chinese (Chinatowns)!</p>
<p>It's a clean, beautiful, relaxed, and intoxicating street in Southeast Asia! Any overseas Chinese who have been to Cho Lon will want to stroll along Sailor Street, especially Sailor Street at night. I often forget the hateful foreign land from afar; however, the appearance of Sailor Street always floats into my heart. It floats up like the night wind of Southeast Asia! It's strangely nostalgic.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, it's our motherland, and in Southeast Asia, it's undoubtedly a foreign land. But Avenue Joffre in Shanghai is famous like a foreign street. The area around Hongkou Park is even more so, full of exoticism! However, it's difficult to smell even a trace of foreignness on Sailor Street in a foreign land. Don't believe it? It all feels like authentic, local Chinese atmosphere.</p>
<p>It's a place ruled by white people, but you never see a white person! In Cho Lon, on Sailor Street. They don't need to come themselves; they live peacefully in Saigon with very few people. The residents here are so docile. On Sailor Street, you've never seen white sailors as imposing as those in Shanghai; Annamese sailors and Chinese sailors are even more out of the question. So why it's called Sailor Street is not very clear. Now, it's a Sailor Street without sailors.</p>
<p>The relaxed and pleasant twilight is brought by the sea breeze. After being splashed with cold water, feeling light and airy, I love to drift onto Sailor Street. Facing the summer night's cool breeze that permeates my whole body, the thin clothes flutter incessantly, forgetting so many (mundane worries)! Walking, walking, I often walk the very long Sailor Street with a smile against the wind. Unwilling to abandon that relaxed, ethereal, and intoxicating atmosphere, I often tirelessly drift back slowly from the end of the street I just walked, after drinking ice cream. The day's hustle and bustle and dullness are all dissipated on Sailor Street.</p>
<p>The pedestrians are all walking lightly, in front, behind, left, and right, looking, staring intently, they are all Chinese, the same color as myself. It's difficult to recognize many Vietnamese women wearing thin black silk blouses and trousers, their red lips and black teeth chewing betel leaves. There are not many Vietnamese men who are a bit darker than us, just a very small number mixed in that are hard to see. Is this the hometown of the Chinese? I don't have the slightest feeling of being in a foreign land; it's as if I'm not stranded in a foreign land.</p>
<p>I've carefully looked at the doorways of all the shops, big and small, tall and short, and it's hard to find a few shops opened by Annamese people. If there are any, only the old foreign guests would know that some Annamese women are selling cigarettes in small alleys beside shops that are difficult to notice. All other kinds of shops are opened by overseas Chinese. The old foreign guests would sneer at the Vietnamese who are a bit darker than us, calling them stupid pigs, saying they wouldn't know how to do business! It wouldn't work without us Chinese; Southeast Asia was all developed by our overseas Chinese. However, overseas Chinese are gradually declining, and Chinese people are gradually being squeezed out. It was all developed by Chinese overseas; however, in the end, overseas Chinese are being driven out everywhere. I recall the prosperous, beautiful, light, and Chinese-like Sailor Street, and I can't help but repeat it. And I miss it even more: Sailor Street, what are you like now? Will it be much more deserted! The Southeast Asian sea breeze is constantly blowing, mixed with a bit of bloody smell! Overseas Chinese are declining day by day!</p>
<p>Sailor Street, as long and bustling as Nanjing Road in Shanghai, I miss you! In this cold winter in the north, a person whose heart is troubled by life, full of heavy melancholy, when will I be able to lightly float onto Sailor Street again? To blow away my myriad worries!</p>
<h3 id="e261">320 Criminal Cases <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— San Duo</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Police Department reported on the prison management situation in 1934. On January 1st, there were 6,312 prisoners in the Ward Road Prison. The highest number throughout the year reached 6,357, and the lowest was 6,020.</p>
<p>This is just referring to one prison on Ward Road, and it has already increased threefold compared to the number of prisoners in the same prison in 1925. However, the Third Day Evening News reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau announced that there were a total of 320 criminal cases in the territory in the past week, with a total of 784 male and female criminals, of which theft cases were the most numerous. Is this number too alarming in just seven days?</p>
<p>The surge in criminals is naturally not a good phenomenon, but the so-called past week is the Lunar New Year, and the most numerous are theft crimes, which shows that the formation of this kind of criminal behavior is somewhat directly affected by the economic situation in the market. It is undeniable that China has suffered from natural and man-made disasters in recent years, and people have no means of livelihood. On the surface of this extravagant and luxurious metropolis, it does indeed make rural people envious as a land of gold, but after reading the above two reports, I worry that the bankruptcy of this metropolis is not necessarily a groundless fear?</p>
<p>In this situation, without seeking fundamental salvation measures for oneself, and continuing to live in a drunken dream with gongs and drums, I am afraid that this number of criminal cases is not the highest record?</p>
<h3 id="e262">Winter on Lighthouse Hill <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Renying</p>
<p>Watching a round of rising sun drop below the horizon, the azure blue waves reflecting the sun's pale yellow light. The intense light of the searchlight shines even more brightly, and the signalman dejectedly finishes his shift.</p>
<p>A (golden ring) of a chimney rises from the horizon. Slowly becoming clearer, slowly becoming blurred. Oh, you who live a solitary life on this long journey! Winter on Lighthouse Hill, even more desolate in the melody of the ocean wind. The electric lights in the lighthouse are all bright, and in the darkness, the searchlight's beam dominates the safety of navigators on this coastline in the boundless ocean.</p>
<p>After enduring a night of tedious sitting, I slowly put down the receiver; a companion takes over my work. At night, the seawater beats against the rocks a mile away, echoing in the silence like rhythmic music. The wind blows past the steel-framed walls of the lighthouse, and I lean my head against the gradually yellowing whitewashed wall, flipping through a newspaper from place S a month ago, using the light of sixteen light bulbs.</p>
<p>(Oh, you who live on this desolate island!) I sigh softly, and my mind turns to the "Robinson Crusoe" that I read as a child!</p>
<p>The cigarettes in the cigarette tin are scattered and sparse; this is the last tin left!</p>
<p>(The supply ship) might dock alongside this Lighthouse Hill No. X tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Will it bring news from home?) A wave of melancholy shadows passes through my mind, and I look out the window at the pitch black. The roar of the sea comes in the silence, unable to see the rolling of this azure blue sea, its great posture, submerged in the darkness.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a ray of light reflected from the searchlight shines in from the street railing, and the angry roar of an echo squeezed out of the cinders from a passing ship.</p>
<p>The next day, I stepped into this wireless telegraph room) in the gloomy weather. Seeing the companion's haggard face after a night of exhaustion, the two pieces of living furniture, the buzzer and the receiver, flashed before my eyes, and I squeezed out two tears of a solitary person.</p>
<p>The sea, sweeping past the free flight of seagulls, and the occasional shadow of a few merchant ships, the drifting of a few sailboats at the foot of the mountain. On the desolate island, the outlines of these few skilled companions, the signalman's silent attitude, a life spent drifting on the sea; has aged his brown skin.</p>
<p>(When will I escape this solitary cage?) Watching the glow of the setting sun reflected again on the azure blue water!</p>
<p>On Lighthouse Hill, another winter has passed.</p>

<p>Sun Deyu Lectures on the Great Learning</p>
<p>Shipping (1180) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>The Way of Great Learning lies in illuminating illustrious virtue, in loving the people, and in resting in the highest excellence.</p>
<p>The Great Learning is the learning of great people. Ming means to illuminate. Illustrious virtue is what people receive from Heaven, being vacant and spiritual without obscurity, possessing all principles, and responding to all things. However, being constrained by vital energy and obscured by human desires, there are times when it becomes clouded. However, the luminosity of its essence has never ceased. Therefore, scholars should rely on what is issued and then illuminate it, in order to restore its original state. Xin means to renew the old. It means that after illuminating one's own illustrious virtue, one should also extend it to others, enabling them to remove the stains of their old habits. Zhi means to necessarily arrive at this point and not move from it. Highest excellence is the ultimate of the natural course of affairs and principles. It means that illuminating illustrious virtue and loving the people should all rest in the place of highest excellence and not move from it. It must be that they fully exhaust the ultimate of Heavenly principles, without the slightest selfishness of human desires. These three are the outlines of the Great Learning.</p>

<h3 id="e270">The Past and Future of the Outdated Hollywood Queen, Pola Negri, Returns to Hollywood <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Min</p>
<p>I'm afraid no one can remember this outdated Hollywood queen, Pola Negri. She has been retired for almost two years since she starred in "A Woman Commands." Most people assume that she will live a leisurely life in the forest from now on and will no longer enter the film industry.</p>
<p>However, her long history in Hollywood makes her unwilling to abandon it for a long time. People familiar with the anecdotes of the film industry know that she was the pioneer of the Hollywood glamorous style. Greta Garbo is just a latecomer, so Hollywood people who admire her are very sorry for her departure and believe that she will not go and never return.</p>
<p>She was also one of those who could not make sound films because she had not learned English. She is Polish. When she was selected as the queen in Hollywood, many people went to congratulate her, but she could only extend the back of her hand for people to shake. After she acted A Woman Commands, she went to Europe. In these two years, she learned fluent English and returned to Hollywood. The news of her revitalization spread out and alarmed many people in the film industry.</p>
<p>Pola Negri is now not young. In the past, she was the woman in the film industry who was most deeply in love, and she had fallen into the web of love many times. Charlie Chaplin was also one of the people she was madly in love with. Many people said that Chaplin and her were married, but this rumor has not been clearly confirmed. At that time, she frankly announced that it was because of Chaplin that she stayed in Hollywood for a long time.</p>
<p>The most unforgettable thing for most people is the story between her and Valentino. At that time, people talked a lot, saying that Pola's heart only contained one Valentino, but unfortunately, Valentino died young. The person who cried most sadly in front of his spirit and fainted was Pola Negri. It can be seen that Pola did have a considerable relationship with Valentino.</p>
<p>However, Pola has been married several times. Prince Mivarana is also one of her divorced husbands. In addition, William Hayes, Roth Laroque, etc. were once her lovers. Her life is like a drama. Looking back on the paintings, she once resolved to compile her experiences into a movie script in the era of silent films, but in fact, she did not succeed.</p>
<p>Will Pola, who has returned to the film industry, be able to continue her past reputation? This is what Hollywood people are eager to discuss.</p>
<p>Many people believe that Pola is a person who bravely retreats. Five years ago, she was the first-class popular actress in the film industry. Even seniors like Garbo, Clara Bow, and Joan Crawford all willingly surrendered to her. What she felt lacking was that she could not speak English. After the sound film dominated the film industry, Hollywood made her understand her shortcomings. She could not have the slightest hesitation. Then, her return to Hollywood must have a considerable certainty, which is no need to worry about.</p>
<p>In the history of Hollywood, she was the one who created the glamorous style. Now the glamorous style has already undergone a sweeping movement and gradually declined. Perhaps her return to the film industry will change her previous style. It is not known.</p>
<p>Some people also said that Pola sighed extremely at the death of Hollywood's old queen, Mary Trancho, and often showed her intention to return to the screen. Perhaps she will want to take Mary Trancho's place and replace her.</p>
<p>Although Pola's future after her return is mysterious, the general public has great hope for her!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e271">Review of "The Red Sheep Heroic Tales" <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>| Carlton Theater Showing</p>
<p>Until now, Chinese literary and artistic writers have not yet produced a work that adequately expresses the passionate and tragic historical facts of the (Hong Yang Rebellion).</p>
<p>This film, "The Red Sheep Heroic Tales," like all previous poems, dramas, and essays about the (Taiping Heavenly Kingdom), does not essentially grasp the core of this great national liberation movement. It only superficially adopts some external scenes. From the perspective of (heroes creating the times), it vaguely portrays Hong Xiuquan, Yang Xiuqing, etc., as (extraordinary heroes and chivalrous figures), neglecting the masses who are the main foundation of this movement. We know that Hong Yang and others were not supermen, not figures who relied on personal power to initiate an era and open up the world, but rather figures who infused a large amount of mass will before they could exert their personal abilities. Serafimovich analyzed Guo Ruhe in (The Iron Flood) like this: (Guo Ruhe is a hero, and also not a hero, because if the masses do not regard him as their leader, if the masses do not instill ideas in him, then he is a most ordinary person. At the same time, he is also a hero, because the masses not only instill ideas in him, but also follow him and obey him as if obeying a leader).</p>
<p>Naturally, the film (The Red Sheep Heroic Tales) does touch upon the masses to a considerable extent, but it also abandons them. For example, when the masses were brutally exploited by officials, Hong and Feng turned their horses around to find Zhu Jiutao; they were ignored by the starving people in the famine relief ranks; Yang Xiuqing abandoned the two thousand stoneworkers and left; the masses rescued Wei Changhui from the soldiers in public outrage, but Wei said, (Thank you all, now the matter has become big, you can all disperse), etc. In several places, the author unintentionally portrays Hong Xiuquan and others as opportunistic figures.</p>
<p>Similarly, because they want to write about heroes by separating them from the masses, they introduce and exaggerate the heroes' surroundings with one scene after another, asking the audience to watch a series of scenes like a running account.</p>
<p>The stoneworkers scene is great and meaningful, if it could be organically applied throughout the film. I think if we compose a better song than Xu Zhimo's (Song of the Stoneworker) to sing, its power could be compared to the (Boatman's Song) in (Soul of the Party Member).</p>
<p>Perhaps to give Wang Huchen, who plays Wei Changhui, more screen time, the scene of Li Dianyuan whipping him is intensified. It's a pity that Wei is so unheroic and obediently tied up and beaten that the audience almost suspects he is a coward. This contradicts Wei's character and spoils the scene.</p>
<p>Finally, I must sincerely advise the author and the audience that in this time of national crisis for the Chinese nation, (The Red Sheep Heroic Tales), which reminds us of the national salvation movement, is worthy of respect.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Review of "Babes in Toyland" <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>Babes in Toyland</p>
<p>| Nanjing Theater Showing |</p>
<p>A comedy that mixes reality and fantasy - that is the essence of the film (Babes in Toyland). Films of this type are somewhat close to the ideals of children, and they must clearly oppose good and evil and subjectively resolve them; in other words, the ultimate opposition of good and evil is the victory of good and the defeat of evil.</p>
<p>What exists in the human world is often the tyranny of evildoers, and these evildoers are often impossible to eliminate. Therefore, what exists in the consciousness of ordinary people is the desire to have some kind of power to eliminate these evildoers, which constitutes their fantasy. In the world of fantasy, evildoers can certainly be eliminated.</p>
<p>The theme of (Babes in Toyland) is to use fantasy to solve the injustices of reality. It constructs a world of toys (Toyland), in which Mother Goose, the Three Little Pigs, the Cat Musician, Widow Peep and her daughter, the boy Tom Piper, and two toymakers live peacefully. But because of the bully Barnaby, their peace is disturbed. Barnaby uses his debt to force Peep's daughter to marry him. Peep and her daughter naturally don't want to, but they have no way to repay his debt. The two toymakers try their best but to no avail, and finally they have to agree to marry him. The two toymakers then try to disguise themselves as the bride, so they can tear up the debt agreement. But the bully tries to frame Tom Piper, saying that he killed the Little Pigs, and is sentenced to exile to (Bogeyland), and the daughter follows him. But this slanderous plot is revealed by the toymakers, and the bully escapes to (Bogeyland), and the toymakers also chase after him. Later, they escape back from Bogeyland, and the bully leads a large group of bogeymen to attack Toyland. Fortunately, the toymakers start the mechanism of the wooden soldiers, eliminating all the evil soldiers and generals, and the bully is also killed. Then, the toy world returns to peace.</p>
<p>Although this film still contains some confused elements, it is a very beautiful comedy, and it is bound to be welcomed by a wide audience of young people (that is, adults as well). The directors Gus Meins and Charles Rogers are also worthy of our admiration. He arranges the atmosphere of the opening fairy tale world very well. The connection of the entire film is also very appropriate, and there are no omissions in the correspondence of various events before and after, such as the toy soldiers, such as Stanner's superb skills. These are all foreshadowed very well.</p>
<p>In terms of acting, Laurel and Hardy are still as we expect them to be. Although they are pitiful in many places and suffer losses, they are still very enthusiastic. This spirit is fully expressed. We can discover in them human love and the passion for fighting the evil world. On the contrary, Henry Kleinbach's representation of the evil side is also appropriately expressed. His sly smile and his insidious nature make us understand him very clearly.</p>
<p>In short, (Babes in Toyland) can be said to be a very successful comedy film, and it is more suitable for children to appreciate.</p>

<h3 id="e273">The Remains of a Block of Meat (David Copperfield) ㈡ <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Cun</p>
<p>When David saw the black panther, he immediately wanted to turn around and run away. He wanted to escape to Old Peggotty, Ham, and Emily, or anywhere. He wanted to leave this once harmonious, love-filled family immediately. Although he was still young, he already felt that the air in the house was completely different. His mother, who was originally gentle, happy, and very fond of him, now did not hold him in her arms, but looked shyly at Murdstone. He only heard Murdstone calling his mother's name and saying, (Clara, my love, you must remember! You must tidy yourself up. David, child, how are you?)</p>
<p>Once again, another stranger walked in, but the tense atmosphere in the house did not relax at all. It was a woman with a frosty face, dressed in black. Her two thick black eyebrows were connected above her nose. David's mother told him that it was Miss Murdstone, his new aunt. The new aunt then glared at David and estimated him before saying, (Generally speaking, I don't like boys. Child, how are you?) David answered briefly. His childish anger swelled in his chest. Miss Murdstone said angrily, (Such an impolite child!) She then said to his mother, (Clara, you are a beautiful and unthinking person, and you are not good at managing the family. Please give me the keys to the house.)</p>
<p>At this moment, David felt that he could no longer bear it. His mother, his kind and lovely mother, was with these people, like this! The air in the whole house had changed, and there was no laughter in it anymore. He soon discovered that everything, everything had changed. And he could no longer sleep in his mother's room. He spent very little time with his mother during the day. In the evening, he recited his lessons not only to her alone, but Mr. and Miss Murdstone also sat together. This made him unable to recite his lessons, because those two cold eyes stared at him, causing his memory to disappear. So, every time the result was that he had to cry bitterly. His mother also cried for him, begging Mr. Murdstone to forgive his youth and ignorance.</p>
<p>But Murdstone simply would not forgive him. He dragged David into his own room and beat him with a stick as if he were a dog who disobeyed his master's orders. David cried and pleaded, (Mr. Murdstone, sir, no! Please don't hit me! Sir, I will remember. If I am with my mother, I will definitely remember, but when you and Miss Murdstone are watching me, I can't recite it. I really can't recite it.)</p>
<p>Mr. Murdstone waved the stick in his face and said, (Really, David? Let's try it.) As he said, he hit him hard. David could not bear the pain in his body and the shame he felt in his heart for a moment. The anger in his little mind suddenly erupted. He slammed his head straight into Mr. Murdstone and bit his hand hard with his teeth. At this time, the door was locked, and his mother could not get in. She cried and begged outside the door.</p>
<p>David was locked in the room, and no one was allowed to see him. He always heard strange, low voices speaking outside the room. Finally, Peggotty secretly walked to his door and told him in a low voice that he would soon have a little brother or sister. He pounded on the door, begging them to let him out. But now no one paid attention to him anymore. Later, the door suddenly opened. Like a poor little dog, he crawled downstairs and walked into that silent and gloomy room. He finally found Peggotty, who told him, (Your mother, that lovely baby···he is···) David said quietly, (She is dead.) Peggotty said, (Your little brother, poor little thing, he is also dead···) (To be continued)</p>
