<p>時評</p>
<h3>羅斯福之睦鄰政策與廣田外交</h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>美國國務卿赫爾前在紐約加拿大恊會演説。「羅斯福總統之睦鄰政策。實以遠東關係爲中心。…其於大西洋。太平洋問題均頗相同。以會議恊定方法。謀政治上及經濟上之安定。而以互不侵犯及縮小軍備。維持和平。」又謂「茫茫無際之太平洋上。亦有吾人之領土屬地。…如門户開放政策早經歷次條約明白規定。…且爲維持遠東及太平洋和平之方法。…如華盛頓條約成效卓著。…仍爲吾人所深信遵守。…」如此立論。在言詞間確本和平之精神。申述美國對於遠東外交至少當與對歐西并重。其具體方策雖不可知。而原則則已表白無遺矣。</p>
<p>夫美國奉行門羅主義已逾百年。以前對美洲以外事變。不欲過問。且亦無力過問。故對於綜錯複雜之歐洲問題。美國除旁觀外。别無表示。然自一九一四年歐戰突發。美國國力驟然伸張。其經濟關係已由南美擴展而至歐洲大陸諸國。在大戰期中。美國投資於歐洲諸國者實數逾百億美金。凡歐洲主要國家在經濟上莫不與美國發生密切關係。然而戰後歐洲諸國皆精力疲敝。其相互對立衝突之情形。又極複雜。十餘年來美國祇有袖手旁觀。而未爲排難解紛之舉。原因自有所在。非必盡屬孤立已久不慣國際周旋也。</p>
<p>戰債之償還問題。係英美間隔閡之一種癥結。同時使美法間亦每生不快。債權既無法收回。美國國内之經濟繁榮。即難於建立。設令恐慌時期延長。則積久以後。必戕釀成巨患。收拾非易。爲美國計。欲解除目前之困難。惟有於歐洲之外。另覓市場。今有一處焉。眼前縱不足供美國之展布。而將來確極有望者。即遠東是也。遠東之國際關係既較歐西爲簡單。又屬未盡開發之區。非如歐洲製造工業均臻極頂。即日本號稱漸進於重工業之國家。其每年輸入之鋼鐵機械。常在二萬萬日金左右。其中汽車機械及鋼鐵。美國均占主要地位。日本如此。其餘各國可供美國之盡量開拓。更無論矣。此美國所以必欲堅持門户開放政策。以冀保留遠東市塲。藉爲將來經濟發展之地步也。惟是遠東方面先有英美之不恊調。繼以日美之對立。旦有蘇聯興起於東歐。近正展其遠略於西比利亞。於是英美日三國鼎立而外。再加一蘇聯。遂形成四角等雄。美國欲於東亞市塲積極開拓。乃更見困難矣。</p>
<p>日本近來盛倡軍備平等。所謂軍備平等也者。非如德意志。欲求陸空軍取得與英美同等之實力。蓋日本陸軍在遠東方面堪稱第一。别無對手。所爭者惟海軍力之平等耳。自海的廢除。日本已凖備二年後自由建艦。不受條約限制。易詞言之。即對華盛頓條約不再受任何拘束也。</p>
<p>然現日外相擴田氏猶高揭「道義」外交之口號。對英固無論矣。對美對蘇。亦盛唱和平。一似眞欲使太平洋風平浪靜者。吾人姑不問道義外交之内容。但試究日本之現狀。第一。議會政治之民主意味已完全喪失。政黨信譽破滅。軍部權能高漲。普通日本人民且大多信仰軍部之權威。第二。軍事費用占全部日本國庫支出百分之四十九。而非常時期且將繼續延長。據云至少須延長至一九三八年。軍費將加至如何程度。吾人殊未敢輕於預斷。然則所謂和平外交。特折衝樽俎間之詞令而已。回憶歐洲大戰之前夕。德國固亦嘗高唱武裝和平。惟其和平。乃以武裝保衛之和平。今日之太平洋形勢。亦近似之矣。</p>

<h3>救濟市面蕭條孔部長允盡力維持</h3>
<p>杜月笙等六代表昨晉謁請求</p>
<p>貨物押欵交中交三銀行辦理</p>
<p>市商會組專門委會擬具辦法</p>
<p>新聲社云、地方恊會等團體、爲救濟市面蕭條、經會議决定、推派代表、晉謁財政部長孔祥熙氏、面陳治標辦法、於昨日上午十一時、地方恊會會長杜月笙·副長錢新之·市商會主席俞佐庭·中國銀行總經理張公權·銀行公會主席陳光甫·錢業公會主席秦潤卿·等主人、同赴西愛咸斯路孔部長公館、晉謁孔氏、面遞兩會呈文、陳述市况及救濟辦法、請令中央銀行指撥鉅欵、直接放欵於工商業、以穩定市面、再徐籌治本方策、以恢復景氣、</p>
<p>孔部長允盡力維持</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨向重要各業方面探悉、地方恊會等團體、代表謁孔部長、要求令飭中央銀行指撥鉅欵、直接放欵於工商業、係指貨物地産等抵押放欵、孔部長對各業蕭條、允决竭力設法維持、關於貨物抵押、允交中央中國交通三銀行承辦、至地産押欵、認關係重大、且爲數甚鉅、當表示須經過詳細考慮、方能决定、各代表至十二時三十分、始辭出、</p>
<p>放欵緊縮免蹈覆轍</p>
<p>銀錢兩業、於民國二十三年總結賑後、對於各項放欵、一致緊縮、尤以信用放欵爲最嚴、工商各業對銀錢兩業、頗有煩言、但據新聲社記者探悉、實係誤會、因銀錢兩業、去年雖幸獲盈餘、但難免有呆賑等情、如通易儉德等銀行寶大裕德昶等滙劃錢莊之周轉不靈而停業、今年市面依舊蕭條、尤較去年爲甚、今爲自身計、故對各項放欵緊縮、免蹈覆轍、此爲勢所必然、</p>
<p>市面蕭條原因有三</p>
<p>市面蕭條之原因、大致爲（一）受世界整個經濟不景氣影響、（二）我國農村衰落、購買力缺乏、（三）自美國政府收歸白銀爲國有後、我國鉅額白銀流出、今雖經政府設外匯平市委員會、加征銀出口税及平衡税、今後奬勵外銀進口、竭力復興農村、扶助工商業之發展、總因受創過鉅、以致一時難以恢復、</p>

<p>国女綁匪供認改期三一續訊</p>
<p>…楊孔氏開釋張正國交一千元保…</p>
<p>大賚錢莊經理兼大東書局董事紹興人王伯瀛、於本月九號晚十一時餘、在同孚路長豐里弄口遇匪被架、致函勒贖二十萬元、業經成都路捕房華探長馮百順、探目崔誠克、包探黄福森、徐德仲等、將案破獲、救出肉票、並先後拘獲綁匪王留根·王蔡氏·馬慎忠·胡阿毛·（即銅匠阿毛）及嫌疑犯張正國·楊孔氏·等六人、又當塲格斃綁匪姚懋卿一名、解送第一特院、訊押各情、已三誌本報、昨日下午、此案由劉毓桂推事蒞刑</p>
<p>一庭集訊捕房亦傳同肉票王伯瀛及各方證人、將各被告解集、被告張正國延吳麟坤律師代辯、首由捕房律師張天蔭起稱、捕房在改其中、對於楊孔氏一犯、查無證據、請求先行開釋、至其所抱王蔡氏之男孩、亦請處分、或發交濟良所留養、劉推事乃</p>
<p>諭楊孔氏准予開釋、捕房張律師又稱、現對於被告五人、依懲治盗匪法第一條第一欵擄人勒贖罪起訴、並對王留根另以刑法三六三條詐欺罪起訴、因王於去年五月間、僞簽支票、向靜安寺路上海銀行支取洋五百四十七元也、所有綁案之情、前次大概已經陳明、且被告等亦已自白、供認不諱、惟據王留根在捕房供稱、當會議時、尚有在逃之一匪名</p>
<p>張震泉者在塲、查張係住於白克路五四二弄四號門牌醫生顧毓奇家之汽車夫、曾與王同西受咸斯路、榮福里十四號、看租房子、當時認爲可以藏匿肉票、遂付定洋、嗣王於一月十一號、在大方飯店三零六號房間、繼續商議、即由死者姚懋卿携來手槍三支、祇因姚當塲格斃、故對於手槍來歷、無從查究、至同孚路長豐里守候肉票一小時、因未晤而返、一月二十四號第二被告王蔡氏、在無錫、由王留根函招來滬、</p>
<p>加參會議一月二十五號、王·姚·張又往守候一次、仍無結果、二月五號、被告馬慎忠偕胡阿毛同至匪窟、由馬代胡與王等介紹一過、遂於七號又開會議、詎斯時張震泉忽聲請退出、因張已找得生意、且以此種事件、實屬犯法、故不願再行參加、但被告等則以張倘一旦退出、深恐走漏消息、同起反對、後由張立誓、</p>
<p>决不洩漏始允退出、迨至二月九號晚十時餘、被告等探悉王伯瀛之汽車已停正長豐里、乃由王姚各執手槍、偕王蔡氏同往實施綁架、（其綁架詳情及拘獲各被告狀况、已誌前報、從略）、但被告張正國、前由王夫婦供出、彼係發起人、後經捕房調查、并無其他證據、在改期中、捕房再向王詰問、則又稱實係誣攀、故要求庭上直接向王夫婦訊問、如果屬誣害、則請准予交保云云、繼據肉票</p>
<p>王伯瀛供年三十三歲、紹興人、并供明於九號晚遇綁情形、謂當時有三匪上車、被告王留根坐於前面、司機姚及王蔡氏、分坐我之左右、執槍恐嚇、不許聲張、并將帽壓住我之雙眼、故祇覺車輪轉動、約歷一刻鐘車停、將我拖入亭子間、取去壓帽、換以黑眼鏡、王姚二人、即向我稱、你家富有、須以二十萬取贖、迫我寫信回去、我答以無此巨欵、故當晚即寫信與友殷芝白、托爲轉交家屬、設法</p>
<p>贖欵八萬元、此後由王姚二人、輪流執槍看守、王蔡氏亦偶然担任一次、惟爲時極短、我在匪窟、并未受到虐待、後因事隔數日、未得音信、心頗憂之、而王等又不時迫我囑函致家屬、從速取贖、蓋以遷延時日、深恐發生變動、而有不測之禍、則須同歸於盡、故</p>
<p>又書一函於友人黄谷梅、後由捕房探員得悉救出、當時我祇聞樓下槍聲、恐有匪黨上樓、故欲從樓窗爬出、致中一流彈於臂部、今已稍愈、我對於此次被綁、事前毫無消息、第六被告馬慎忠、係同弄友人殷芝白之汽車夫、至其是否係馬走告消息、我不得而知、其餘各匪、我均不相識、云云、又據王之汽車夫</p>
<p>馮福棠證明東家當時被綁情形、并當庭指出王留根即係開車者、其餘姚及王蔡氏兩匪、則因坐於後面、不能指認、祇覺有一手槍指住我之背部、嚇禁聲張等語、又據證人黄谷梅、證明屢次與匪黨在電話中接洽、及後又遺代表蕭然前往大方飯店二○一號房間談判、破案情形、又據證人殷芝白蕭然、及大方大中大成公庽等茶役陳茂泉等六七人</p>
<p>供述一過詰之王留根王蔡氏供認綁架不諱、并稱對於張正國實係誣攀、馬慎忠、胡阿毛、亦承認參預其事、張正國則矢口否認、謂因王私用大康汽車公司欵項、由我報捕登報通緝、是以懷恨各等語、訊至此、時已薄暮六時、劉推事諭張正國准交一千元舖保、在未具保狀前、准由其代理吳麟坤律師負責保出、餘人均分别還押、候改期下月一號下午續訊、</p>

<h3>龍華寺僧元照盗賣寺産案昨日訉語</h3>

<p>嚴望隆供</p>
<p>年卅五歲、甯海人、住大南門白漾弄福安里二號、從前是開店的、（問）你與元照什麽關係、（答）並無關係、不過認識而已、（問）官問曰、敏丯僧説你是元照外甥、嚴（答）不是的、（問）洪善寺廟基究竟如何的、（答）是我家的、是項基地、借給洪善寺起蓋廟宇、（問）有何憑證、（答）無的、自民國十六年期滿、由我家將地收回、現在方單已換執業證兩紙、（問）有上首契否、（答）無、（問）是何户名、（答）凌古愚、（官）曰顯見此項基地並非你家所有、（答）是我外婆的業産、凌古愚是外婆的男人、贈與我家的、（問）民國十六年間、元照是洪善寺住持嗎、（答）是的、（問）據你説十六年份將地收回、可有憑據、（答）無、（問）現在共造房屋若干、（答）廿四幢、十二幢、店面市房、每月房租卅二元、十二幢住房每月廿八元、（問）是否由你收租、（答）是的、官命將執業證交案、嚴（答）一紙尚在、一紙係向新華銀行抵押洋五千元、官曰、你應將執業證立時交案、否則羈押、嚴聆諭、即回顧旁聽席中之友人、央其速往携取、訊至此、陸起律師起稱、現在敏丯對於嚴望隆已向刑庭自訴、况嚴屢傳不到、</p>
<p>請求收押</p>
<p>俾免逃亡之虞、問官命敏豐至案供稱、洪善寺其地房屋、爲老和尚光鑑募化而來、請求恢復洪善寺、遷回佛像、照常供奉、（官）曰你現寓太陽廟、你們出家人到處爲家、何必要定洪善寺呢、（答）此廟爲老和尚一番苦心、今一旦被元照拆毁、抑且一應菩薩、東離西散、心實不忍云云、末據元照供稱、洪善寺大約在同治年間落成、當初地價極賤、所以租地蓋廟時、並無若何乎續、（官）曰不錯、邇因地價日昂、方始有此等事情發生、現在你對於龍華寺如何答辯、元照（答）稱我到寺接管時、已悾無有、住持數年、備受辛勞、因無法維持、方始辭職、（問）香烟廠是你開的嗎、（答）不是的、（問）爲何香烟廠圖章等物、均在你處呢、（答）因我有五百元股本、向之拆股、（官）曰胡説、如要拆股、應該到公司内算賑、爲何反到你家呢、</p>
<p>元照語塞</p>
<p>訊至此、由李芬檢察官起而論告一過、向官遂諭開始辯論、首由陸起律師起而略稱、洪善寺廟産、從前老和尚在日時、出租之老房客、尚有數户、可以證明廟産爲老和尚所有、查此項新建之房屋、均保有火險、其保險單均在元照處抄出、係用恒利記恒利號、及凌友元等户史、分向保險行四五家投保四萬餘元、既稱爲嚴望隆家業産、爲何保險單反正元照處、試問民國十六年之前業户爲誰、顯爲洪善寺公産、况此項方單、向由大南門口莫子經家代爲保管、老和尚圓寂後、由元照向莫家將方單索回、現在請求恢復洪善寺原狀、並將佛像遷回、如不能全部恢復、則亦須恢復一部份、安置佛像、餘則照舊出租、俾資津貼開支、現在元照之姪婿嚴望隆在外向王姓兜售此項福安里房屋、索價二萬七千元、頃由王姓前來詢問購買此産有無糾紛發生、本律師答以訴訟尚未解决、當然有問題發生、</p>
<p>故未成交</p>
<p>云云、繼而潘振聲律師起稱、元照盗賣龍華寺廟産一百十五畝有零、並貝葉經七篇、古銅佛一尊、（即俗稱太子佛）相傳二千餘年前之物、均甚名貴、可稱世界稀有之實、其太子佛像一手指天、一手指地、價值連城、前者元照串通胡蘇記僞立契約、將寺前平房七十六間、佯作胡蘇記租地造屋、因龍華寺爲三國時赤烏年間所建、環繞王帶河、佔地九十餘畝、素乏糧賦、元照無法盗賣、所以異想天開、做此偷天換日之把戲、其搜刮手段、不謂不精等語、山主陸明照至案供稱、請追還盗賣之地、歸還龍華寺管業云云、問官復謂元照曰、你前次説洪善寺的基地業主姓馮、廟基由馮姓收回、現在爾有何説、元照答詞含糊、問官得供、以案已明瞭、認爲終結、定於本月二十八日下午二時宣判、嚴望隆着發檢察處收押候究、</p>

<h3>潘公展演講上海的學校教育（五）</h3>
<p>當美國退回「庚子賠欵」時、教育家在某地方開會、中間有一部份人説、我們可以把這一筆錢來辦「普及教育」至少也應該提出大部份欵子來做「普及教育」事業、但另外有人説、這使不得、如果拿這欵做全國「普及教育」的事、這筆欵也不够、「小學教育」的經費、應該各省各縣自己拿出來、我們用不着把美國退回的庚欵零零碎碎的花到各省各縣去、不如還是把這筆欵拿來辦「高等教育」吧、後來爭論的結果、仍是用這欵來辦「高等教育」吧、後來爭論的結果、仍是用這欵來辦「高等教育」以及保送學生出洋、鼎鼎大名的「清華大學」、就是用的這筆欵子、也還有别的幾個大學同受補助、故日後「中法」「中比」「中英」等庚欵退回、都是先後用到「高等教育」方面、記得前幾天有個報紙批評留學生、説得很對、「我夋拿許多經費花在留學生身上、這筆錢同花在小學教育上的經費比、並不見得少、恐怕要想等、或者還會超過、而我們得到的結果是什麽呢」、有人統計、全國高等教育經費在二十年之中、已經從三百九十萬增加到三千三百六十萬、而學生只從四萬加到四萬四千、其浪費可想、可是留學生以至大學生、對國家民族、在小學教育上未必肯盡義務、像這一班不識字的「文盲」以及小學生、一直到現在、還是祇靠幾個小學教員在那裏教、祇是一班師範畢業的中等學生在那裏擔負這種責任、而留學生回國、不是做官、就是當大學教授、大多數是不屑來做這種「民衆教育」事業、不屑去教「文盲」、從前那一派主張先辦「高等教育」的人、以爲我們辦「高等教育」、造「專門人材」、先把國内工商業發達起來、等到國家富了、然後「小學教育」自會普及、他們自己以爲這是「既庶矣、又何加焉、曰、富之」、如果整個國家富足之後、再來多辦學校、使得大家都可以進學校、受教育、這是叫做「既富矣、又何加焉、曰、教之」、他們的見解是要既庶而富、富而後教、不過、如照這樣弄下去、看到目前中國的窮現象、恐怕大家將來連學校都没有得進、各位曉得中國爲什麽貧窮、我國的貧窮、是由於工商業不發達、這便要問一班學工業學商業的專門人材到那裏去了呢、再有一點、我國的貧窮、固然由於工商業不發達但在此二十世紀生産競爭的時代、我們「生産」的本領還没有學得來、大家倒早把最時髦的「消費」的本領學會了比方人家造多麽層高的大厦、我們也得住住廿多層的洋房、人家坐汽車、我們也得出必汽車、以至於戴高帽、着大禮服、跳舞、喝酒、大家都「洋化」了、這些事情、是什麽人開頭的、不客氣説、第一是「留學生」·第二、是「大學生」、我們可以説决計没有小學生會這樣「洋化」的、也决計没有鄉下老會這樣「洋化」的、所以我們講起來很痛心、中國的貧窮、以及民衆的失教、其一部份的責任、是要由這班「洋化」的學者來負的、世界上不公道的事情很多、試想培植這班留學生的錢、是從什麽地方來的、除了中間有一部份留學生是靠祖宗庇蔭有錢出洋的以外、其餘、總是「官費」、這「官費」是從什麽地方來的、都是國家的「捐税」、而「捐税」究是從什麽地方來的、都是國家的「捐税」、而「捐税」究是從什麽地方來的、説來很可憐、都是由我們人民身上抽出來的、中國有三種大的捐税、（一）田賦、（二）關税、（三）鹽税、這些捐税、總是加在我們無分貧富的大家身上、此外、像「所得税」、「遺産税」、在外國早有這種專抽有錢人捐税的辦法、而我們中國没有、我曉得上海有一個富翁、他坐在家裏、每日就有上千上萬的收入、但没有聽見國家抽他一點「所得税」、至於「田賦」、多是出在農民身上、「關税」也大都是出在農民身上的、比如中轲出口貨、以「農産品」較多、這些「農産品」出口、沿途要報關抽税、而且都是「生貨」賣的價錢很賤、而進口貨、總是「熟貨」、這些「熟貨」大半是日用品除一部份「洋貨」爲殷富之家所購買外、其餘的日用物品、差不多推銷到内地各處鄉村都有、這些貨物的捐税、也是加在購主一般勞苦農民的身上、除了剛才所説的關税以外再看「庚子賠欵」也是從關税裏面抽出來的、倘我們回想爲什麽要有「庚子賠欵」、這是出「義和團」當日要「扶清滅洋」、後來被「八國聯軍」打敗、外國人同清廷訂辛丑條約了、外國人覺得這次要把中國罰一罰、就叫我國賠償他的出兵費、可是賠欵並不是拿出兵多少來算的、他們以中國人口來計算、其賠欵四萬萬五千萬海關兩、等於對每一個中國人罰他一兩、而且這筆賠欵分三十九年攤還、是要加利的、照本利合算起來、竟達九萬萬八千二百二十三萬八千一百五十兩、這就等於每一個中國人被罰海關銀二兩、</p>

<h3>無極外差機修理須知</h3>
<p>— 蕭明襄</p>
<p>業餘無綫電研究者，或常感覺到無極外差式收音機，原理深奧，構造複雜，偶或遇到一架損壞的外差機，簡直不知從何着手，其實無極外差機的訊號週率（高週率）放大，成音週率放，及電源供給三部，與通常熟見的調整高週率機，一般無二，如讀者對於此項機件，已能明瞭無遺，則關於此三部的困難問題自能迎刃而解無庸本文再贅。</p>
<p>無極外差機之所以引爲複雜者，因三部之外，復有振盪級，一次及二次檢波級，中國週率放大級，以及外差法的收音裝置種種，致發生的困難問題極多本篇所述限於解釋此項無極外差機的特殊問題以及修理方法。</p>
<p>必備的儀器</p>
<p>工欲善其事、必先利其器、修理外差機，第一項必備儀器，即是電表，如直流伏脱表，千分安培表，歐姆表等，均爲必需，但全數置備，未免糜費太甚，幸而此項電表，均可相互化用，如能裝成一收音機分析器，Set　Analyzer（此器作法，當另爲文述之，）則使用時，尤覺便利非凡。</p>
<p>除電表外，修理外差機特需的儀器是振盪器，須能在全廣播帶及中間週率帶範圍内，産生振盪，其週率並須絶對校凖。</p>
<p>倍週率</p>
<p>交流電流，除非爲純粹的正弦曲綫，常有較本身週率高的倍週率産生；眞空管在收音機内工作時，其特性曲綫，决不能成爲純粹的直綫即通常所謂直綫部份，亦稍彎曲，所以正弦曲綫，爲之失眞，而常産生極多的倍週率。</p>
<p>倍週率常爲本身週率的倍數，如二次倍週率，即爲本身週率的二倍，三次三倍，四次四倍，餘類推；倍週率之距本身週率愈近者，其力愈强，如二次或三镒的倍週率，有時雖遠至五次的倍週率，亦能使收音機發生騷擾，中間週率175KC的四次倍週率爲４×175＝700KC，即此本身週率之八次倍周率，仍在廣播範圍以内，若收音機的隔離裝置稍有缺點時，此倍週率常易與外來訊號週率相混合，而生外差作用，致使收音機工作不能合法。</p>
<p>今再舉例以明之，設將收音機調整至一電台，週率爲690KC收音機的中間週率級係175KC，則振盪級自當調整至865KC,若中間週率的五次倍週率875KC，或因故輸入至帶有訊號週率之電路内，自將産生10000週的音差週率（Veatfrequency）如成音週率級不能割去此週率時，揚聲器内將發生極尖鋭的怪呌聲，若中間週率級配合稍不合法，致週率略低於175KC，此病象將更易發生，今假定中間週率爲174KC，在接收同一電台時，振盪級週率當須爲864KC,此過率或與174KC之五次倍週率870KC相混淆，結果産生6000週的音差週率，此週率尤極易在成音週率級内生狂呌，由是之故，無極外差機的中間週率配合問題，極關重要，以175KC最適宜。再如振盪級週率與訊號週率，已極凖確配至相距175KC，但中間週率級不能配諸至與此週率相同，收音機靈敏度將大受打擊，效能全失。（待續）</p>
<h3>談談「石英晶體」</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>短波發射機的射程，不在電力的大小，而在於發振週率的穩定。假使能調節適宜的話，一架短波發射機雖僅有五或十瓦特的電力，做横越大洋的通訊，並不是一件困難的事情。要穩定週率的方法很多，但是最有效的，莫過於利用石英晶體（Quartz　crystal）了。</p>
<p>用石英晶體來控制發振週率的發振器，就是所謂「晶體控制發振器」（Crystal　Controlled　ascillator.）。這樣的發振器是利用石英晶體的「壓電作用」（Piezo-electric　effect）來做發振週率的控制。有了這種設備的發振器，其週率完全靠這晶體的尺寸大小來决定的：所以在普通情形下電路中數值的更變，眞空管的發熱，高壓電源供給的波動，可以不致影響到週率的穩定。所以這種電訊不但易於收聽，而且音調十分清越優美。</p>
<p>當一瑰石英晶體受到壓力或張力時，在它週圍就有電塲發生。反之，當我們把它放在電塲裏，則它的體態上就發生變動。這種作用就是所謂「壓電作用」。石英晶體所以能用來穩定發振週率，就是利用這壓電作用。實在有壓電作用的東西很多。不過比較上石英最適宜，所以應用最廣。</p>
<p>天然出産的石英晶體，是無色透明的六邊柱體。體晶體學（Crystallogy）上講，一塊完整的石英晶體有三種「軸」（Axis）,呌做X，Y，Z軸。詳細請看附圖，圖中虚綫就代表軸。礦産的石英，先要加以裁割，研磨方可應用。裁割有X割法及Y割法的分别；詳細看圖自明，圖中黑影部份就是割片的所在。X割法習慣上又呌垂直割法，或居里割法（Curie　cut）Y割法又呌平行割法，或三十度割法（30　degree　cut）</p>
<p>X割法和Y割法各有優點。Y割法比較上容易發振，但是有時有二個發振週率，所以X割法的使用較多。</p>
<p>一塊磨琢完全的石英晶體的厚薄，和發振週率，直接有關係。照試騐的結果，f×t割法的　＝112.6；Y割法的f×t＝77.0；式中f是發振週率的千週率數，t是晶體的厚薄的英寸數。</p>
<p>這樣的石英晶體所能做到的週率範圍，是幾個千週到十四兆週，但是實際使用的不過從四十千週到七兆週。因爲從上段我們知道，石英晶體的厚度是和發振週率成反比的；雖然理論上，我們只要磨成適當厚薄的晶體，就可以得到任何假想的週率，但是較低的週率需要甚大的整塊原料，限於天産的關係，事實上不可能；同時較高週率的晶體，因爲極薄而易碎裂，所以亦不適用。</p>
<p>在磨製時，因爲石英很硬，所以要用煤油和細金鋼砂合成的研磨劑來研磨。一塊製作良好的石英晶體，大約一英寸見方，它的二面應該互相平行而没有凹凸不平的地方，面上没有油污，同時假使是X割法的話，其面應和X軸互相垂直；Y割法則互相平行。所以没有適當的工具儀器，還是買現成製品此自己磨製好。當用它來控制發振時，應把它夾在二片金屬片中間；市上亦有專做此用的晶體夾子（Crystal　holder），購用很便。</p>
<p>晶體控制發振器中的石英晶體，是接在發振管的栅電路中，代替原來栅路中的變量電容器及綫圈的。當然各種發振綫路多可以這樣代替，但是比較上屏栅諧振式的最好。現在就舉一屏栅諧振式的晶體控制發振綫路做例，如附圖。其餘不再多説。</p>
<p>要以小電力而做遠程通訊，採用石英晶體控制的發振器是最好没有了。</p>
<h3>檢波之種種（續）</h3>
<p>— 思廉</p>
<p>（四）全波檢波，與半波檢波相同，惟雙屏極不用並連式全波檢波在整流時，其輸入能使平均，且能阻止載週率（Carrier　frequency）流入三極部份，是其優點。見圖四。</p>
<p>（五）推晚式檢波，諸位都知道推挽式的成音週率放大，其放大力甚强，則用作推挽式檢波當亦能生奇效，圖五爲其線路圖，R爲四兆歐姆耗阻器，此處用作栅漏，V爲19號眞空管經實騐後固能届遠，收南京中央電台，在揚聲器中已很響亮，選擇性與靈敏度（Selectivity　and　Sensitivity）都極佳，較之加一級射電週率放大差不多，此式檢波作者在去年早已試裝，惟眞空管不爲19號由而爲二只三十號眞空管，成績甚覺滿意，今有複眞空管出售，當較便利多矣。（完）</p>

<h3>遠程收音之利器</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>——試用天綫調整器</p>
<p>能增加輸出力至七倍以上——</p>
<p>本文所介紹的天綫調整器，（Tenatuner）功效雖很偉大，其實内部的構造，就穿了也並無若何奧妙可方，祇是一個很簡單的諧振器而已。該器在接收近地的播音時，能增加收音機的選擇性，接收遠地的播音時，又能加多輸出的音量，减少輸入的雜聲，實爲一般遠程收音迷所不可缺少之利器。</p>
<p>附圖，示該器接綫的方法，C1，C2及C3爲三連變量電容器，（每節之電容量爲.000365　mfd，並聯後約爲　.001　mfd.）綫圈人，在直徑三英寸長四英寸半之圓筒上，用二四號雙絲包綫繞一百五十圈，在第五，第二十，第五十，及第一百圈上各抽一頭—合計首尾共有六個綫頭，分接在2至7各螺釘上。全器均裝於一鋁質或銅質隔離箱内，除地綫接綫柱外，其餘各項零件，均須與金屬箱絶緣。</p>
<p>使用時，先將各綫接如圖示，（金屬箱需否通地，須俟實騐後始可决定，有時不通地綫，反可，增進効率）。然後旋動開關SW2（自第2點起，第1點備天綫直接收音機用。）同時並調節可變電容器，俟收音機得到最響亮的音量和最清晣的音質爲止。（調節波長較長階段時，如感覺電容量不足時，可將開關SW1關上。）</p>
<p>本器使用法之簡捷，已如上述不過還有一點要值得注意的，便是；接收任何波長的電台時，磁感量以用得愈小，電容量以用得愈大爲愈妙。換句話説：當諧振時，綫圈的圈數愈少，電容器的容量愈多，成績便愈佳。據實騐，當週率爲600KC，開關SW2旋在第6點時，可得7.25之輸出力，如將SW2移至第7點，再增加電容量，雖然同樣可使綫路諧振，可是輸出力便立即减至5.3倍——約有三分之一倍的損失。</p>
<p>下表示使用天綫調整器後輸出力增進之狀况。該表爲美國無綫電專家使用精密儀器測騐後所得之結果，當週率爲600KC時，約得7.25倍或17.2小倍爾之輸出力；（請參閲本刊第四十三期拙作「電力與音量之比率。」）爲1500KC時，約得1.8倍或5.1小倍爾之輸出力。平均約得五倍或十四個小倍爾之輸出力。</p>
<h3>長短波交通之比較</h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>短波</p>
<p>（一）短波所需收發機件較簡單。</p>
<p>（二）短波所用天綫頗短，其組織亦簡單。</p>
<p>（三）短波通訊可用微小電工率而達極遠距離。</p>
<p>（四）短波接收機諧振甚鋭，信號不易互相擾亂。</p>
<p>（五）天電騷擾對短波機影響甚微。</p>
<p>（六）但地磁嵐騷擾於短波較顯著。</p>
<p>（七）短波通訊，波長時間與距離須有適當配置。</p>
<p>（八）短波對海氏層之反射能力遠勝於長波。</p>
<p>（九）短波通訊因地面波被吸收消滅，反射波所達又遠，故有跳躍距離之生，遂使中間一段距離電音寂然。</p>
<p>（十）短波易於發生回聲信號之現象。</p>
<p>長波</p>
<p>（一）長波所需收發機件較複雜。</p>
<p>（二）長波所用天綫甚長，設備亦較昂貴。</p>
<p>（三）長波之同距離通訊，必需更大之電工率。</p>
<p>（四）長波接收機諧振不能尖鋭，故接收易受干擾。</p>
<p>（五）長波機則受天電之騷擾極劇。</p>
<p>（六）長波則受地磁嵐之影響甚微。</p>
<p>（七）長波通訊及其能達距離，則受時間之影響較輕。</p>
<p>（八）但長波沿地而推進則不似短波之易被地面吸收。</p>
<p>（九）長波則無跳躍距離現象。</p>
<p>（十）長波則不然。</p>

<p>期麥市面、洋麥雖好一二角左右不等、惟開價時、本月份因交割日近、祇有一二日交易、一般浮多、均亟須了結、并以銀根關係、套貨方面、均無意收回、故最低時至三元七角七分、三月份亦低至三元八角六分、迨至下午開盤、初尚平平、旋因空頭略補、回起一二分、不過現洋麥合價步鬆、前途當少過好之望也、結果本月份小一分、三月份小三分、四月份小六分、現麥市面、微見軟弱、中次貨喊落一二分、見交未暢、開山東宿州麥三元九角二分、蚌埠麥三元九角、由申大去四百包、福新去一千五百包云、</p>

<h3>文學上的偶然性與必然性</h3>
<p>— 張香山</p>
<p>在文學上的偶然性與必然性的問題是與在哲學上的偶然性與必然性的問題，一樣地被處理着的，出現於批評者的對偶然性的抹煞，而過分强調必然性的意見，近來却常常見到；道也許由於作家的作品，過分地利用偶然性，來展開故事的全局，致使批評家來抹煞偶然性了。</p>
<p>在中國舊小説裏，簡直是以偶然性來支配必然性的，二者不並連在一起。尤其是才子佳人的小説，常常以一塊手帕抑或佩玉等等的遺失餽贈，而引起故事的進行。甚至到了初期的新興文學，描寫一個主人公的轉向，或者是一個偉大的塲而之展開，而也靠一種極勉强的偶然性才能一瀉直下，這種現象是必然地給作品以傷痕，並使讀者感到滑稽和唐突的。</p>
<p>最忠實於事實的描寫之自然主義作家們，是很不以偶然事件爲然的，莫泊桑曾經説：「藝術家在撰擇主題之時，從充滿了偶然事與無價值事的人生中，祇擇取其必要的特殊的事件，而把偶然事等除去。」</p>
<p>爲了意料不到的災難而死亡的人，在一天之中，實在有很多，然而藝術家們爲着應該忠於事實的關係，而也必須描寫這種意料不到的災難麽？描寫在故事的中間，那主人公的頭被落磚擊破，以及被車輪給壓死嗎？」</p>
<p>的確，偶然性在創作中，不能佔着領癫的地位，因爲偶然性越多，則使人感不到眞實；然而也並不能絶對否認偶然性的重要。</p>
<p>本來在我們認識現實的過程上，那必然性與偶然性是相互地連結着，出現於現象的表面上的。如果爲了偶然性的不易與眞實貼貼地相融俣，而絶對地抹煞否認的話，那就太機械了，亦即太側重於必然性了。我實際説來，由於作者的處理這二種東西底巧妙，才能最忠實的表現現實，二者互不可缺，單靠必然性是不中用的。因爲偶然性的一般之否定，絶對的必然性之承認，不可避的則將導成宿命論，亦即成了對於不動的運命之信仰。黑格兒説：「由於一般地否認偶然性，則在自然之中祇是單純的直接的必然性支配一切，如以此種必然性爲哲學的基礎，則我們還不能踏出神學的自然觀之界限。」</p>
<p>然而作家之巧妙地處理這二種東西，究竟是如何地處理呢？爲着説明這問題起見，在這裏先舉個例子，以作帮襯吧！</p>
<p>托爾斯泰的「復活」，不僅僅暴落了帝政時代的裁判制度，尤其在必然性和偶然性上，與我們以極大的教訓。</p>
<p>湼夫利得夫誘惑了姑母家的使女加秋霞，並且發生了肉體的關係，使加秋霞懷了孕，因此流落成娼妓，而負了殺人的罪名；當審判她的時候，却巧湼夫利得夫是個陪審員；由此湼夫利得夫開始替她求赦罪，並且棄了爵位散資財而追踪到西伯利亞來，這個故事的關節，却在審判的時候，徧徧湼夫利得夫列席於法庭中，如果他不列席於法庭的話，則故事祇好中斷了。所以這一點是非常的偶然事件。可是這樣地偶然的邂逅，不給托爾斯泰的作品的效果以傷痕嗎？不會的，因爲這裏的偶然性，是在全體的構成中，與必然的過程相連結着的。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰一面緊拉着被典型地設定着的個人的運命，而一面想展開當時的一聯底决定的社會問題，他由於描寫了在這種塲合裏活着的人間之具體的相互關係，並描寫了他們生活着的有了葛藤的社會，得以具體地解明了偶然與必然的活的關聯，並難以分解的矛盾。在這裏偶然性停止了是偶然的事情，因爲在偶然性中現示有必然性。而同時必然性也停止了是必然的事情，因爲這是由於偶然性給與了動因。</p>
<p>有人曾説：「偶然的事物是持有根據的，因爲這是偶然的。可是這不曾持有却巧同程度的任何根據，因爲這是偶然的，如此偶然的事物是必然的，必然性是把自身當作偶然性而規定的。他方面那偶然性則也是絶對的必然性」。</p>
<p>同樣在文學上，我們處理這二種東西，第一必須要分析歷史的必然，對於主人公必須分析其年齡出身教養和環境，而括概起來負起其歷史的使命。第二使這必然性通過一切的偶然性，導往其必然之道程上去，這也就是説用家靠着偶然性而發展其必然性，但重要的却是在偶然性中須顯示出必然性的根據。不然的話就成了隨意布置，從半空中降下珍寶一般的希罕了。這種局面也就是中國舊小説裏的書生遇難，徧遇俠客打救一般唐奕和奇罕。</p>
<p>總之我們不能硬生生的把必然性與偶然性割離，使之相互連結，説得簡單地就是「使之天衣無縫」。亦即一切的作家，應該在所有的過程裏找出必然性來，以必然性作基礎，使偶然性作發展必然性的拍車，而構成作品，我想這准能使作品合理化，而且具體地表現了現實。</p>
<h3>談「雜文」</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>彷彿有一位編輯先生曾經説過：有些文章是很難辯别牠是小説，散文，或者隨筆的，但只要牠有内容，寫得好，則這種情形，也仍舊無妨於牠的偉大。</p>
<p>不錯，這仍舊無妨於牠的偉大的。</p>
<p>然而，倘能够分分清楚，以爲那是散文，那是隨筆，那是小説，而仍舊無妨於牠的偉大，這自然更好了。可是做着這種「更好」的工作的，似乎並不多見，有之，當自林希雋先生始。</p>
<p>至最近文藝畫報的寒夜隨筆里，林先生自以爲不是「雜文家之流」，但他也寫雜文，然而又在他的雜文里，一則曰：「幾乎不算是文藝創作的雜文」；理則曰：「雞零狗碎的非眞正的文藝作品的雜文」；三則曰：「倘加以嚴格的限定，大多數是無從容納於文藝作品領域之内的。充其量不過是一般雜文家施用爲駡人快己的絶無價值可言的工具」。</p>
<p>不錯，雜文是工具，而且這工具實在厲害。牠被拿在林先生的手里，已經自己駡了幾通，這回是索性把自己放逐到「文藝作品領域」之外去了。</p>
<p>幸而林先生的「嚴格的限定」，是只限於「大多數」的。</p>
<p>但可惜的是：我們竟無從知道林先生的限定是怎樣地嚴法。雜文的取材，的確是很廣泛的，牠也弄文墨，也講科學，也談社會，也刺政治，倘以爲這樣便該從「文藝作品領域」里趕出，則取材於社會，政治，科學的小説，詩歌，戲劇，也將站不住了。只有專門描寫文藝家生活的東西，才配在「文藝作品領域」的里面。</p>
<p>這樣，嚴格誠然嚴格，林先生高据在「文藝作品領域」里，都要唱起「空城計」來了。</p>
<p>如果那所限的是體裁吧，雜文的確不像小説，詩歌，戲劇，但也不像其他各科的論文和記敘，這就因爲牠是雜文的緣故。既然少許可以算做文藝作品，則大多數也就毫無問題。因爲在體裁上，牠們都是雜文，是一樣的。</p>
<p>如果説是筆法或佈局吧，那就更不成問題。雜文的筆法和佈局，也同小説，詩歌，戲劇一樣，是因人而異的。所以，也有直，也有順，也有彎曲，也有「狗屁不通」。</p>
<p>然則林先生究竟是何所見而把雜文逐出「文藝作品領域」的呢？答曰：這就是他自己所説的「完全屬於一種武斷」。</p>
<p>倘使要把雜文歸入或逐出那一科，這是有待於慎密的分析的。像林先生那樣一提起雜文便已「魂不附體」的脚色，我們實在不敢要求他冷靜地想一想。</p>
<h3>歷史小品脞談（三）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>歷史小品，在技巧方面，和幽默小品科學小品本没有什麽大不同。歷史小品取材於史事，也和幽默小品取材於諧趣故事，科學小品取材於自然小品，一樣地專注於某一種對象。史事那麽繁富，題材可説是容易找得很；但史集的史事，常爲傳統思想的蔓草所淹没；要從蔓草底下抉取史的本相，從庸俗的歷史觀底下逃出來，養成找題材的「史眼」，却是一件極不容易的事。我們着手寫歷史小品，雖不能和一般治史的人一樣，把全部精力時間化在整理史料上頭，但基本工作是必不可少的。就史論史，所謂史事的本身是一件事，作史者筆底的史事又是一件事；史事的本身不可複演不可重見，我們只能依憑史家筆底的史文來推想史事的本身。於此先要考察三件事；先考察史家在怎樣情形之下觀察這件史事的？次考察史家在怎樣情形之下寫道史文的？又次考察，這史篇寫成以後，在怎樣情形之下留傳下來的？要有十二分耐性追溯上去，使所把握的史事與史事的本相不相差十分遠。歷史的人物事件，别人用他自己的道德觀念，權利關係批判過了；紅臉的是忠臣，花臉的是奸賊，凝固爲定型輿論。我們要有社會科學，歷史哲學的新知，重新建立知人論世的尺度，方能脱去前人的思想覊絆，方能於社會公認關雲長爲不愛色不愛名利的聖人的定型之下，描寫他的愛女色，粗魯債事的性格。從前做史論的，又有愛做翻案文章的習氣，其觀察不正確亦與隨聲附和的矮子看戲論相彷彿；我們要有史家的寛大風度，讓史料引導我們到那最後的結論，纔能免於「愛新立異」「亟亟下結論」的弊病。</p>
<p>大凡歷史上的巨靈，他的地位愈高，愈成爲一般人的箭垜，愈爲附加上去的道德外套所遮蔽；文藝家不敢公然向社會挑戰，他的筆就爲傳統的説法所懾住，不敢有自己的創見了。諸如世説新語容止篇記温忠武與庾文康投陶侃事，可以寫成一幕文人怕武人的趣劇；但大家腦中先有陶侃運甓一類故事的影子存在着，决不敢把這個荆州系的軍閥（陶侃）寫成武人氣度，又决不敢把荆州系軍閥和揚州系軍閥（蘇峻）爭權的故事穿插起來。又如明末清初，説書名手柳敬亭善於敷陳史事，以「能直諫會旁嘲」爲當時名公大人所敬重。但據桃花扇所引，他説論語太師摯適齊那一段，仍不脱腐儒説高頭講章的酸道理，並不見得怎樣高明，可見搬開傳統思想之難。偶於灘頭看到小唱本，其中演講孔子去濟章，生動有致，倒比柳敬亭高出一等我現在敢説一句：作歷史小品的，亦當先有此疑古非孔的精神。</p>
<h3>酒徒</h3>
<p>— 陳福熙</p>
<p>邰老二踅出醉樂居酒店的門檻，嘴裏哼着「四郎探母」。肚皮裏吃醉了酒，脚步兒走得歪歪斜斜，似乎要倒下來了。但他正想走回家，耳朶邊忽聽見：</p>
<p>「老二，趕快回去呀，你的老婆……」</p>
<p>他旋轉頭來看，原來説話的是麻皮阿五。</p>
<p>「管他！」</p>
<p>摇摇頭，依舊走他路，心裏想：</p>
<p>「我的女人眞的和别人那個嗎？」</p>
<p>邰老二每回在醉樂居吃酒，常有人和他這麽説，但他從不理會的，他總是向他們一笑，連連的説：</p>
<p>「呃呃呃……管她呀！」</p>
<p>吃醉酒，一回家便睡了；醒過來，早把别人的説話忘記得乾乾淨凈。邰老二和老婆一向和睦，去年還生過兒子。關於這個兒子，在醉樂居酒店中不曾開過玩笑。一天，剃頭師傅張福，也喝飽了老酒，嘻皮笑臉的説：</p>
<p>「邰老二，那個兒子是不是你生的？」</p>
<p>「管它！」</p>
<p>「老婆和别人生了兒子還不管？」</p>
<p>「管它呀。」</p>
<p>邰老二依舊喝他的酒。</p>
<p>在醉裏，他是不聽信他們謡言的，但今天，他又聽到麻皮阿五的話，嘴内儘説着「管她」，肚裏着實不高興。他想這批人太可惡，爲什麽老是説這些話，是開玩笑呢還是眞的？</p>
<p>他歪歪斜斜的走。</p>
<p>「女人家，年記輕輕，出花樣也是説不定的……」</p>
<p>不知怎的，他忽然這麽想起來，且又覺得想得不錯，於是憤憤了。</p>
<p>「操×的！你快給我説，單瞞我嗎？」</p>
<p>「説什麽呀！」</p>
<p>「還要裝痴？」</p>
<p>「要死！怎麽發酒瘋啦！」</p>
<p>「嘿，今天老子可……」</p>
<p>邰老二拿起茶杯擲過去，擲不中，「砰」的一聲碎在地上。</p>
<p>「要你死，嗎勒格臭蛋！」</p>
<p>依舊走着歪歪斜斜的脚步，走近她，揪住她的頭髮打。</p>
<p>妻哭了。</p>
<p>邰老二出過氣，跑進房去睡覺，一覺醒來，聽得老婆嗚嗚咽咽的哭聲，方才想起剛才打了她。他想老婆是個老實的女人，待他一向要好，那裏會做這種下流的歹事！外邊人的話，不過是知他開開玩笑，怎麽竟在醉中誤打了老婆呢。這麽想，他眞感到極度的不安……</p>
<p>第二天，他到醉樂居酒店時，他聽到别人正講着「邰老二打老婆」的消息。</p>

<h3>嚮晚（五）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>大漢公司是三大開間的洋台門面。左右二邊，是鑲着很大玻璃的陳列窗。窗裏凌亂地雜放着過時的布疋。那些布疋底顔色，不是過分的綠，便是過分的紅；全是些單純的原本的顔色，没有複色和套色的。布疋上底花頭，也大都是團花，或廻龍。絶没有立體形的圖案。——眞是保存着「農村都市」的中古的情調。但在這些布疋之前，却又歪歪斜斜地掛着不少的水災奬劵：（每個窗上，掛有百來十張。）在晚風中驕傲地飄動。</p>
<p>大漢公司大門上懸着個白沙罩的大燈。太陽也似的燈光，照出水門汀結成的牆壁上一大横條灰黑色的水痕。像一個大鐵箍似的，攬腰地抱住這麽大洋房。恐怕這大洋房裏的買主們擠得太多了，會爆炸似的。但此刻呢，大洋房裏除了鬼影似地點綴着幾個夥計外，却什麽也没有了。連説話聲也是寂寂的。眞是一座墓墳也似的空虚呵！</p>
<p>二個人於是各各吐了口冷氣。過後，身上潮出一陣汗。</p>
<p>「唔！熱呢！」矮的轉過身來，正看着馬路的對面。</p>
<p>「是呀！」高的也轉身往馬路左右望。</p>
<p>「這個不是嗎？這個不是嗎？」突然矮的叫了起來。指着那斜對歆生路口，裝着個綠色闊下簷的，那門面。「這上面——這下簷的横條上，不是寫着春陽旅館嗎？」</p>
<p>「正是——」高的有點不高興自己底伴當居然會有這一著聰明的發現。「正是——在日本，是没有這麽難找的。門台上也不給裝上個大電燈。一點也不那個。那個——我在日本時候……」</p>
<p>二個人攬馬路的衝了過去。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （顔鑫泉）</p>
<p>青年著作家WW，在未娶妻的時候，他曾經很正經的對我説：「女人，不過是男人的一件玩物罷了」。可是他現在娶了一位摩登化的妻子後，非但不能把伊當玩物，反而自己做了「妝檯的奴隸！」</p>
<p>王老太，今年年紀已有五十一歲了。雖然生了兩個兒子，可是簡直没有靠兒子享了一天福；有一次，伊憤恨地對隣人們説：「我不過算是他倆嬰孩時代的保姆，童年時代的照料者，現在我老了，在他們的目光中，恐怕當我是一件笨重的贅累物」。</p>
<h3>短稿短談</h3>

<p>文明進而人事繁，繁則求簡，猶熱之思凉，事所必至。昔人相見，正務之前，例有一番客套，以長談敷衍爲能，今則開口便提，如單刀之直入；即此説長道短，可覘世變所趨。文以紀語，理有同然，—讀者因求經節其時間，作者允供緊縮之筆墨。即觀最以趣味爲中心之小説，曩多長篇，兹亦短篇是尚，可概其餘。故因時制宜，小品文字形成天驕之子，洵非倖致。</p>
<p>去兹十四五年，余曾創行最小幅之報紙，曰：「最小報」，同時瘦鵑著有最小幅之雜誌，曰：「紫蘭花片」，咸倡短什，相釀成風；雜文無論，小説，劇本，都冠以「最短的」或「最小的」名詞，勢若雲蒸霞蔚。「紫蘭孃下嬪最小郎」，留出版界之佳話。</p>

<p>譽短什者輙稱：「短，小，精，悍，」似未恰當；余意：「精，警，雋，永，」其庶幾爾。文字鍊精，理意務警，語妙雙關斯雋，味藴無盡乃永，四者具備，而小品文與一切短稿之能事畢矣！</p>
<h3>孤山訪梅</h3>
<p>— 季誠性</p>
<p>足疾新愈，我就約李君往孤山訪梅。</p>
<p>呵，梅林的潔白可愛，芬芳的香氣沁入我們的心底，立刻教我想起了林處士的名句：「疏影横斜水清潔，暗香浮動月黄昏，」可惜這時並非黄昏，假使有一輪朦朧的月，又不知該添幾許詩意！</p>
<p>慢慢兒拾級而上，在放鶴亭略事休息，就去訪林處士墓，這兒梅花開得正好，也有不少含苞待放的，因爲有人收拾，所以這兒的景色，不再像以往的荒蕪不堪了，只惜梅花無知己，遊人們除了皮毛的讚歎外，又有什麽表示呢！即使騷客名士，又有誰當伊爲妻呢！伊們只會挽着俗不可耐的摩登女郎來此徘徊。給林處士的英魂見了，怕要作三日嘔吧！</p>
<p>因爲右足感到酸痛，於是賞罷了放鶴亭畔的梅林，不得不遽然告别了，爲了過於戀梅，我就折了一枝歸去。</p>
<p>假使是踏雪訪梅，又不知該添幾許遊興？</p>
<h3>生存競争中之其命者</h3>
<p>— 彤父</p>
<h3>沾染烟癖的貓狗</h3>
<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>吾友雙琴館主，蓄一貓，絶絢麗，珍愛無殊拱璧。館主有芙蓉癖，每逢一榻横陳時，將它抱置懷中，隨手撫摩以爲樂。於是，貓遂成了習慣，祇消瞧見主人點好烟燈，彎身躺下，它即跳登牀上，蹲坐主人肘臂間，掀動鼻觀，嗅其噴吐出來的濃烟，好像刻板一樣，無日或間。一天，館主因事他主，此貓到了主人日常吸烟時候，聞不到烟味，而癮竟暴發，躑躅主人榻上，作凄厲的呌號，兼之呵欠連連，涕淚與涎沫交下。主婦見而不忍，即忙鋪設烟具，傚伊的丈夫所爲，移時，才算過去。</p>
<p>新近我們鎮上來了一位祝由科醫生，挈着哈叭狗二頭，一大一小；它天天去上「售吸所」抽烟，總把它們一同帶去。在它彎轉身體燒烟的當兒，這兩頭狗却極安靜的蜷伏身邊，一動不動，等到它呼呼地抽滿一嘴烟，喝了一口茶，那大的一頭，馬上過去嘴對嘴的接受其含在口内的餘烟，還將舌頭伸進嘴裏去舐，左右擺蕩，嘖嘖有聲。似此接連數次，然後讓那頭小狗也來做同樣工作；先大後小，倒是很守秩序，從未發生爭吵。據這位醫生説：那頭小狗，原屬大的所生，在娘肚皮裏，已經傳染烟癮；所以産生下來，就得用烟給它日噴幾口，以致弄得它的癮量，更大於母狗了。</p>
<p>這樣看來，鴉片烟這種東西，非但貽禍我們民族，而且還流毒獸族哩！</p>
<h3>日本上野動物院一瞥（下）</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>馬來半島的蟒蛇有二三丈長，北海道的大總重百餘斤，其餘像穿山甲，蜥蜴等，每種總有四五類，都有詳細的説明。</p>
<p>運動院的中央，是最猛的獸類居住地，有很粗的鐵柱圍着，内中有三頭獅子三頭老虎，其他還有豹子和狼。當獅子大吼一聲，全屋裏的玻璃窗，都格格作響，眞不愧爲萬獸之王。每一種獸類住處旁邊，都有廣大的散步空塲。天暖的山谷裏玩耍。長頭鹿是菲洲的特産，它所住的洋房，有二層樓的高，仍不十分舒服，頸長可知了。</p>
<p>每種動物出産地，都有説明，凡是日本有的，大都自己去收集。一部份是向印度馬來半島澳洲南美洲去購來的。我國的産品不多，只有一頭很美麗的金錢豹，和北平市上常見的騾子罷了。滿洲高麗的出産很多，大約也表示親善的意思罷。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咜未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>月英一聽這話，知道這事，已經毫無轉圈的餘地，還在這房裏等些什麽，於是撅了嘴，向胡氏道：走罷。胡氏什麽話不能聽懂，至於一個去字，一個滚字那很清楚的可以了解的。還不曾和人當奴才，就讓人家呌着滚了，這話也不用跟着向後問，工是不好帮的。現在女兒來攙他時，他也氣忿得興奮起來，逕自扶着門牆走出來了。月英跟着他走出了小院子門，唧咕着道：這倒是我不好。知道這樣，早就回去了，何苦在院子裏又怕又凉哭上那一陣呢？胡氏更是比這女兒無能被人駡了一陣，有什麽可説的，只好是抬起袖子來，擦擦眼淚而已。這時，小西天的後門，久已關閉，母女二人，摸摸索索的穿過幾重屋子，只好由大門出去。當他們走到第二重大樓下時，那屋梁上懸着一盞大汽油燈，火燄正燒得呼呼作嚮，那光亮是其白如銀，便是落下一根針來，也可以看到。在過堂的兩旁，擺下了許多躺椅和茶几。茶几上放着茶烟，有些人架着腿躺在椅子上閑談。有些人圍了一張茶几，在那裏下象棋，有些人，揀了報紙在燈下看。雖不見得個個人臉上都有笑容，却没有什麽人帶了哭象。月英看到，心裏也就暗想，這也是呌人不明白的一件事，爲什麽同是一個人，大家都吃飯穿衣的，很是歡喜，爲什麽我就這樣的苦呢？他正是這樣的向許多人看了發呆，對過樓梯上走下來一個女子，穿了淡綠色的上衣，藍色的裙子。（一四○）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>不過伊所繪我們説的，却也大半是前此伊早就告訴過我們的老話，而我們是不得不假裝着聞所未聞的神氣來聽伊説的。</p>
<p>「唱戲的人可説個：那是非常信奉神佛的！」今天，伊居然説出了一段比較新穎的事蹟來。「尤其對於那人稱伏魔大帝的關公，格外的恭敬虔誠。無論一個怎樣歡喜説笑的人，祇要是輪到他今天去關公。他就立即會端莊起來。而且還得先去買一尊關公的佛馬來，摺好了高供在桌上，點起香燭，誠誠懇懇的磕了頭，然後再取起來，很小心地揣在他自己的懷裏，一直到戲唱完，才掏出來，依舊供在桌子上，再磕過頭，最後，還得把它擱在紙綻上焚化。經過了這樣的一番做作，他們方始能安心，否則必將惴惴然以爲大禍將臨了。</p>
<p>「唱戲的人又是最愛守舊的」！太后繼續的把伶人生活形容給我們聽。「無論一舉一動，以及戲文中的唱詞，念白，行頭上的花紋，插戴，都視同金科玉律一般的謹守着的，永遠不肯改變；不但他們自己一生一世是這樣，就是傳到們的子孫或徒弟，也仍然如此」！</p>
<p>這兩段話可説是極中肯要，我後來又聽别人也是這樣説起過。</p>
<p>我以爲中國舊劇的文塲，還不失爲一種很優美的歌劇；至於武塲就不免太熱閙了！每逢演到兩軍交戰的時候，大鑼大鼓，敲得人的耳朶也幾乎震聾；再有那種拚性捨命的蠻打，也的之太野，我是最不愛瞧的。（二五一）</p>
<p>科學趣談</p>
<p>人類的嗅覺太差了　倘若你打過獵的話，當你看到獵犬一面前進，一面在辭石荒草中急劇地煽動它的鼻子，你能想像出它所感受到的是什麽嗎，我想這不但是你，即使普天下任何人亦都是想像不出的，實在是因爲人的嗅覺根本太差了啊，雖然人類未見比一切動物的嗅覺都弱，但與同屬哺乳動物中之善嗅者一比，那相差簡直有十萬八千里之遥了。如其不信，請着德教授麥脱海史新近所做關於這問題的有趣的實騐：隻豚鼠（豚鼠亦爲善嗅哺乳動物之一）自幼便習慣了吃大麥粥，一天，實於粥中加入徵量的砒霜，它當時很爽快地吃下，結果，自中了毒，以後乃幾天未敢近大麥粥。如今，餘含砒者外，同時更給予一盤含硝化碖（具苦杏似的氣息）的大麥粥，（粥五十公分，硝化碖八十滴）它經短時間的辦别，只吃後者因後者固有非所習慣氣息，但未曾有不良的影像。祇經過這樣短短的一天的經騐，他已印入了，只有具硝化碖的氣息的大麥粥，「你纔可吃」這一件事實。自後每次都是同時給予兩種大麥粥，其一所含硝化碖量則逐漸减少，自一：一○，一：一○○直至一：一○○○○○○○，其時豚鼠猶能辨别出其氣息，而認爲可吃，若再稀釋，它便不能再感覺得硝化碖的存在，故兩者都猶豫不吃。嗣麥氏明令他的高足十人以爲實騐，如同做豚鼠實騐時一樣給予好多盤大麥粥，所含粥量與硝化碖量亦相同，並令各學生個别地記下他們所猶能辨識硝化碖存在的盤子號碼，結果是硝化碖稀釋至一：一○○○○以外，他們便已一律不能嗅識其存在。由此可見人類之嗅覺竟較豚鼠的要差千倍，即一種人類僅剛能感覺得香氣的香料在豚鼠只要其量的千分之一，便已能同樣地感到此種香氣。這是一件多麽驚人的事啊！</p>
<p>胞衣之科學的製藥　胞衣或胎盤爲包裹胎兒之膜，胎見即由此自母體取得營養並排洩代謝産物。故爲每個人的發育史中之功臣。但一般未受過醫學説禮的人一聽提到「胞衣，」至少便會感到不自在，即女人自己亦視爲不潔之物。可是，簡直無奇不有，無物不包的我國故醫藥，大概是由於會意的緣故吧，竟認爲是安心養氣補血益精等等之妙藥（即所謂紫河車，）雖然連「大夫」自己都不知人怎麽安法。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>裝璜</h3>
<p>— 陳三</p>
<p>三個銅子一塊猪油糕，裝上錦盒，陳設在大玻璃橱裏，没經騐的人就給楞住，不知這塊猪油糕是打那一國來的？科學焙造？或者請有「專門技師」？原因，裝璜太「富麗」了，瞧去，連那三個銅子一塊的猪油糕亦「堂皇」起來。</p>
<p>在化妝品公司裏做夥計的朋友對我説，都市中男女的眼睛，生來只注視裝璜的，我問他理由，他就提出事實來證明：有一位腦袋縮在灰背大衣領裏的太太來買一瓶香水，把頂好的給她，她還是摇頭，没法，就在貨倉裏把原品裝了一隻巴黎玻璃盒，再把標價加上一倍，那位太太伸上鼻子一嗅，稱道貴品，照數付值購去，實則，她不是買香水，她是買了那隻巴黎玻璃盒—裝璜。</p>
<p>然而，倒也不光是貨品需要裝璜了才值錢，在這「祇重衣衫不重人」的世面上，人亦不能不稍爲講究一點「塲面」了，根據「佛要金裝，人要衣裝」的原旨，一件竹布大掛似乎總不成個模樣兒，在宴會上，别個貴客或者要悮會你是僕毆之輩，就是主人方面，亦將認爲是一種不很光榮的事，而且，假使你要登一個七層的高樓，那開電梯的不等你吩咐，他就會同你説：「自家兒打扶梯上跑上去！」天呵，要是你身體上有了一套漂亮的衣服，嘴裏有一支雪茄，手裏有一個皮包……那你就得多麽舒服，拉鐵門，開鐵門，呌人瞧得起。</p>
<p>老實一些的人又要放出老實的眼光來，指斥這是「虚榮」。</p>
<p>可是，這世面上，「虚榮」畢竟於人生有點好處的，猪油糕裝在錦盒裏賣，人當然更要注重表面的「賣相」，譬如你並未讀過外國文字，大號眞空管自來水筆儘可插在口袋裏，眼睛没有病，戴一副平光的博士架亦足以爲面部生色。這世界講求實際的，還不是白癡！别以爲你有着一肚皮本事就想出而應世了，你先得站在着衣鏡對自己打量一下，你要在社會上混飯吃，勸你還是少講實際，否則，人家都吃的是飯，你没有捧一碗薄粥的份兒。</p>
<p>或者，你又要發怨言了，將咒詛那夥不識貨的人，但是，世上眞正識貨的又有多少？在澡堂子裏誰不是個光赤赤的身體，張先生不比李先生少了點件麽，不過，一個出來套的是青布短掛褲，一個出來却穿上皮袍子，形色上立刻顯了高下，這當然是兩個人「裝璜」的不同，但，你説，人們將要認那一個是「上等人」？</p>
<p>自然，穿青布短掛褲的是大部落選了的，這不能怪人們不識貨，是他自己缺少了「裝璜」。和不裝錦盒的三個銅子一塊的猪油糕，是同一個例子。</p>
<h3>鄉居雜記</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>最雜得的要算靜穆到不能再靜穆的空氣，這情調，這環境，是最適合於一側久慣了都市生活而終於覺感到那囂雜的氣分之可厭惡的人作一下心靈上的養息，這里，絶没有鎮日徹夜呌嚷着的使你一聽會引起無端的煩亂來的都市里邊特有的各種車馬的交樂響，有的是晴朗的藍天色，行雲在腦袋上閒態地翺翔着。此外就是偶然之間打隔村遼遠的去處傳來一兩聲列車經過的汽笛聲音。但當這聲音這進你耳鼓里來的時候，已經成爲很輕微而悠長的了。是决不會使你生起什麽不快之感來的，也許正是一種妝綴這太沉寂的自然界稀有的樂奏吧。如果初從那物質機械體榸成的不住旋動着的高速度的都會里溜了出來，而投身到這大自然温柔平靜的懷抱中，你才會深切地覺出都市的一切是怎樣惡俗和黑暗。村里的一切又是怎樣的清爽活潑，同時感到好像却了一身沉垂的担子似的有看説不盡的舒適。</p>
<p>這里所有的人們的生活都是健康的，充滿了勁的。完全不像都會市毫無夜日之分，一眠往往便是到了黄昏日落的時候，長年目瞧不見太陽的面孔，弄得個個的嘴臉都是病患者似的慘黄灰白，没一絲顔色。這里人們一天的日子差不多可以當都市人過兩天的，他們的作活更是有一定規則：曰程昇，便開始手脚的勞働；日頭沉，整天的活計已做完，休休息了，做飽了肚子，便各各尋自己的玩兒去了。</p>
<p>大清早上，沐着淡淡的朝墩，踏着迂緩的小步子，一步一步走向那田野間閒散，駘蕩的輕颸一陣陣從前邊徐徐地吹來，閉了一下嘴唇，深長地呼了一口氣，一種新活的情味馬上盤溢着整個身子，心靈感覺都同時有着異樣的鬆脆與愉快。而時時絆住你的脚不，帶點凉意的，却是青青的草子含着水晶似的露水，因你的抹動一滴滴碎落在地上了，也許還有那近邊的葉子叢上的小烏在秋秋地歌着清晨的小曲子。</p>
<p>一路走去，繼續映入眼廉的，將瞧到在田塍上緩緩地走着三個五個的婦人，一邊牽着孩子，一邊帶了些髒衣服到池塘里濤洗；田園野遠遠近近疏疏落落地蠕動僂着胳膊的農家在拔去雜草，也有推着牛犁子，翻着田土，一面叱咤着那畜牲，一面却吹起口哨子來。</p>
<p>如逢着春耕的到來，他們便越忙個不可開交了，只教天色一發亮，便都爬下來，帶了鋤剷各樣傢伙急急到自己的田裏去，平時只是吃白米弄玩兒的幼小的孩子也跟着爸爸一同地去幫作了，整整一天的工夫便全消磨在田里，中頓由着管家的娘兒們燒好了送上給他們吃，有時連娘兒們都忙着了，便草草地改易旁的東西如蕃薯之類代飯用。這樣地大清早上一直到日向西的薄暮才得回家。他們從不曾想愉懶，誰碰着誰都是那麽問問。</p>
<p>——大木兄你的田快犁了吧！</p>
<p>——過幾天便可插秧了。</p>
<p>聽取了這回答，發問的會不自覺焦灼着：</p>
<p>—你的人衆多，眞寫意啊，像我獨脚隻馬，什麽事都要自己來。好在老天爺做美，好幾天不下雨，如果這時候下起雨來不是連秧都播不或嗎，那才糟呢？</p>
<p>聲調里雜着非常的急迫。</p>
<p>可是這似乎是存在記憶上的景物，如今再度居住這村里來，要看到農家們像以前一樣勤息於田務的情形已不易看到了。雖然這里的清靜以寂是仍故，而都會的騷動和繁華也仍故，有些却變了。</p>
<h3>得銜頭後之工作</h3>
<p>— 丁墨</p>
<h3>舅父</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>母親從家里寄快信來，要我趕快收拾回家，因爲舅父的病是一天一天地沉重下去。據醫生説：病情是很嚴重的，恐怕没有痊愈的希望。因此，不得不預備料理舅父的身後事，要我趕快回去帮忙。</p>
<p>已經整整的六個年頭没有到過舅父的家里去。可是，舅父一生所做的事情，和他的容顔，直至現在却還很清楚地印在腦際，—他約莫有四十左右的年紀，有着中等瘦削的身材，小小的腦袋，挽着幾根稀疎亂鬆鬆灰白的頭髮，一張黝黑而帶乾瘠的菜黄臉龐眞是瘦得太不成樣，一點光彩豐潤的氣色都没有，簡直像標本室里的蠟人！兩隻眼睛深陷得像兩個窟窿，然而，那兩顆黑瞳子，却像夜里天空閃着的星星。</p>
<p>房間里的空氣深夜般的死沉沉的。在窗前，我低着頭沉思了一會，覺得心坎里有千萬隻憂鬱的蟲兒在蠕動，把整個的心都佔去了。於是，於是，我抬起頭來，望望窗外浮過藍天的淡雲，輕飄飄的，寂寞寞的。這時，六年前的舅父的家，迅速地在我底腦海里浮現了。</p>
<p>當母親還未出嫁的時候，外祖父已在南洋患濕氣症逝去了。那時舅父的年紀尚輕。因爲外祖母祇生舅父一個男孩子，所以，不讓舅父遠離，到「番邦」去承繼父業。同時，舅父也是一個文質彬彬弱不經風的文士，對於經營生意，不</p>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>消説是外行的。因此，也樂得在家里享受外祖父遺留下來的産業，過着清雅幽閒的生活。</p>
<p>我自少就很喜歡到舅父的家里去，因爲舅父的書齋養着不少各式各樣的鳥兒：如善跳躍善歌唱的黄鸝，畫眉，以至於能傳遞書信的鴿子，都是最能逗引着我快樂，使我戀戀不捨的。</p>
<p>「雲甥，那隻灰翅膀鷹眼睛的鴿子生了蛋了，又白又大，怪可愛啦。」當我每次到舅父的家里去，碰見舅父的時候，他總是笑嘻嘻的小孩子般的告訴我。</p>
<p>「舅父，就給我養出兩隻像灰翅膀鷹眼睛的小鴿子出來。」我依貼在舅父的身前，咿咿呶呶地强逗着他要着　直等到舅父點着頭。</p>
<p>光陰像流水般的逝去，一點也不容情，迅速地我已經整整的六個年頭没有到過舅父的家里去了。雖則我每年都要回到家里一趟，可是，假期的短促，也就使我無從再見舅父的面了。但在母親的來信中，我總可以略略地知道幾年來舅父的一點情况，知道他底家勢的頽敗，暮景的凄凉，然而，這祇不過在家信中所看到的舅父的一點點底情况吧了。</p>
<p>當天我就趁着正午的火車離開Ｔ市。隔天的午後，舅父的家就在眼前浮現了。那高大的白粉圍牆，却不像六年前般的潔白，一斑斑地剥蝕着。黑漆的大門也退色了，金亮亮的大銅門環也生上一層厚厚的綠銹，在斜陽光底下，越顯出一種頽衰潦倒的氣象。</p>
<p>當我推開那兩扇退色剥落的大門，門内那架綠油油有着亭亭嬌媚的姿態的紫丁花，已經連影子都不見了，只剩那携扶着她的木架孤零零地竚立着。黄鸝，畫眉，鴿子，連一根羽毛也没有了，一切都冷清清的，意外地顯出衰落的氣象。走完了冷清清的門巷，打入了中廳，徒然間空氣就嚴肅起來，母親和舅母圍繞着舅父的瘦削的身軀悲切的哭着。</p>
<p>此外，一切都靜穆穆的，呈現着一種衰落的氣象。</p>
<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 代尼</p>
<p>從細雨斜風中他們避進了一家單門面的咖啡座。</p>
<p>搓着手，在對座中坐下來的時候的那個臃腫得像冬瓜一般的白俄婦人展着難看的笑容向主顧鞠躬。他没有徵求她的同意的要了兩杯甜味的酒及一盤牛奶蛋糕</p>
<p>是三點鐘光景，咖啡座最清靜的時候，店主人轉到櫃後去了，各暖如春的雅室中坐着他們兩個不預料的來客。</p>
<p>—昨天早上接到她的信，説是在療養院中過了二個月婚後生活，這是够滑稽的！逃出熱度表和白衣姑娘的軟禁室，每天，電影作消遣，希望我今天三點鐘到國泰來做她的同伴。</p>
<p>在風雨中如欲遇見她，她却説不喜歡看蝴蝶夫人主演的片子，就那樣莫明所以地到這裏避雨。</p>
<p>她對鏡理着被風吹亂了的頭髮，像自語地説：「近來眞是胖了呵！」</p>
<p>「我也想進療養院去，自己瘦得太可憐了！」</p>
<p>不想那樣隨意的一句話引起她的不滿，你覺得好意思嗎？——活生生的人做熱度表的俘虜！」</p>
<p>店主人恭敬地送上了食品，又退到櫃後去了，她臨走時的笑容，覺得她是幻想着甜蜜的夢吧。</p>
<p>「那個傢伙想起做公爵夫人的時候！」</p>
<p>「你眞的變了！對於一個流落在異國的弱女人没有一點同情心嗎！」</p>
<p>她舉起酒杯，没有沾着一點綠色的液體重放下了，目光遍視着他，使他不敢注視，彷彿她今天要做一次萬人欽仰的英雄事蹟。</p>
<p>「兩個月似乎過了三年………」摇了摇頭把底下的意思和着酒吞了。</p>
<p>他不能再答話了，其實是無從説起，端詳着櫃裏一排洋酒瓶，忽然想起要是那個胖傢伙挺起了腰站在前面，不禁笑了起來。</p>
<p>「眞是值得你好笑的，在療養院裏度密月！」</p>
<p>彷彿雨後的晴天，一切從陰雲中暴露出來，女人就是那樣地深思遠慮「小姐，你誤會了我的意思，你以爲我還能每天捧着一束鮮花到你床前來問安嗎？你也得對一個戰塲上敗回來的英雄抱一點同情啊！」他憤怒地乾了面前的酒。</p>
<p>「哼！那流氓！送我進了醫院却跑了呢！你不知道？」</p>
<p>他幾乎又想笑。</p>
<p>「是的，報上告訴我他做標金失敗了；但是在另一個塲合他是没有宣告失利啊！」</p>
<p>她顯露了眞誠的笑，這笑喚起他久已遺忘了的情感，他覺得自己漸漸偉大，如其站到洋酒瓶的櫃前，可以從公爵夫人那裏佔到勝利的。慶祝她完成了英雄事蹟的功業，舉起酒杯來，但是那是一個空杯。</p>
<p>離咖啡座正是三時電影散塲的人們擁進來的時候。天空停止了雨絲，斜風迎面拂來微微感到春的氣息，重走過國泰門前，他瞧着雪爾維薛耐美目盼兮的廣告畫對她説：</p>
<p>「你要到美領署去，詢問櫻花再放的時候嗎？」</p>
<p>「討厭！我不喜歡看她的片子！」</p>

<h3>「塊肉餘生」攝成影片</h3>
<p>— 西瀛</p>
<p>考證精詳講求不遺鉅細</p>
<p>劇中人物恰合原著風光</p>
<p>膾炙人口的，迭更司的名著，「塊肉餘生」，現在已經被搬上了銀幕了。將來該片在滬公映之時，我們可以一覩十八世紀中迭更司時代的風景人物，因爲「塊肉餘生」的攝製，雖至微至細之處，亦是考據精詳，無疵可尋的。見是讀過迭更司原本，或是林琴南的譯本的人，他們在腦筋之中，對於書中的一切人物，必定有一種想象，他們的形貌，言談，舉動。他們以後看見了銀幕上的「塊肉餘生」之後，他們一定會拍案呌絶的，因爲銀幕上一切人物的形貌，言談，舉動，可以説和他們腦筋中所想象的，却不謀面合也</p>
<p>我們暫且先放下劇中一切人物的配置，先來講講這張片子拍攝之前，一切籌備的經過。</p>
<p>差不多一年半以前，大衛塞爾斯尼格（David　Selzmick），就是造成了「小婦人」驚人成績的青年攝製家，就開始尋求可以和「小婦人」齊名的題材。那個時候，「小婦人」的導演，喬治柯克爾（George　Cukoi），亦和他很表同情。還有一位著作家，就是“Cimarlon”的著作人郝華德伊土他勃魯克（Howard　Estabrouk），亦是很熱心的。於是他們三個人就結合了，共同尋求優美的題材。</p>
<p>以後的事，在這裏也不能細述。簡單的説，那是一九三三年的十一月，他們已經决定了採取迭更司的「塊肉餘生」之後，他們爲要使影片中的空氣逼眞起見，他們就尋到了幾本迭更司初版的小説，因爲在那些書當中，有迭更司時代的美術家斐斯，親手所繪的人物肖像。他們將那些肖像作了攝製影片時用的藍本，因爲那些肖像，都曾經過迭更司自己親手選過，認爲確是和他書中人畢肖的。此外還有本那德的鋼筆畫像，那是在斐斯自殺之後才採用的，亦拿來當作參考之用。這些繪像都從新複印了許多份，作爲當局人參考的資料。這就是銀幕上人物，何以和一般迭更司小説的讀者，心目中所想像的吻合的緣故了。</p>
<p>他們工作人員考據的精詳，亦不盡在人物的形貌一方面。他們並且特派了攝影師到倫敦，凡是與十八世紀有關的東西不論大小，一概攝成照片。於是他們所攝的照片，一共有七萬張之多，其中有十八世紀站杻的式樣，以及墻上糊的花紙，鎖和鑰匙，布類等等。眞是應有盡有，無微不至。這許多照片運回了美國，就成爲米高梅公司製景部，布置房屋器具的張本了。</p>
<p>在倫敦，他們並且尋到了一家裁縫店，是專做迭更司時代的衣裝，以供舞臺上表演之用的。他們尋到了這家裁縫店，得到了不少帮助，因爲那家裁縫店，亦是事事都有來歷的。他們有十八世紀各種衣裝的繪畫和照相。他們尋到了這家裁縫店，請委派了他們專爲「塊肉餘生」中各項角色做衣裝服飾之價的東西。這樣，「塊肉餘生」中衣服的式樣，可以算是極有根據的了。</p>
<p>在一九三四年的六月，柯克爾，伊士他勃羅克，和塞爾斯尼克三個人，覺得這些還不够，必須自己親自去視察一趟。於是他們就連袂同赴倫敦，親自去採風問俗。他們先從大衛考伯菲而（書中主人翁）的誕生之地，勃倫特斯東，考察起，按著書中的程序，經過鴉墨司，度佛而，坎忒白雷等等地方。他們並且會到了英國迭更司學會副會長許華坡爾氏，請他帮忙，並且勸他一同到好萊塢去加入攝製的工作，以及担任編劇的事務。華坡爾亦就慨然答應了，担任了「塊肉餘生」攝製的監視人。</p>
<p>劇本的編寫，却是一種很困難的工作。他們一共寫了八次之多，因為迭更司的原書其長，現在要將它縮短成為影片，頗是一件煩難的工作。從事編寫的，一共有八個人，而以華坡爾為其主腦，但是他們都時時覺得束手無策。譬如説，迭更司原書中所描寫的宴會，共有三十七次之多，現在用了那一次好呢？</p>
<p>再論到劇中人物，電影劇本中祗用了二十六個重要角色，但是原書中可稱為重要些的角色的，實不止三倍也。除去重要角色之外，還有到少五十個開口的小角色，要尋適當的人物。其中種種困難和趣事，亦就更僕難數。譬如却爾斯拉爾頓被選中了扮演書中的密考伯。因為密考伯是秃頭，他就將頭剃得光光的。等到明天一上塲，導演又覺得他不像那窮苦的密考伯，就又換了一個别人。他却白白將頭剃成和尚了。</p>
<h3>影片談評</h3>
<h3>評「王先生的秘密」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>—金城映—</p>
<p>有人這樣説：「不要再使人流眼淚罷，中國電影是需要喜劇的時候了」。可是電影這東西，並不像去年是「婦女國貨年」今年便是「學生國貨年」的那樣分得清清楚的。</p>
<p>不過就在這時候我們看到了「王先生」之後的「王先生的秘密」了。「王先生的秘密」在故事的整理上，似乎是比較「王先生」來得完備一點的。至少這裏有一個從頭至尾，頗爲連得上來的故事。假使我們一點也不懷着更高的希望的話，那末在這故事中，多少表示了一點小市民的普遍的生活與觀念。王先生和小陳，確是目前都市中某一種典型人物。他們代表了一般市民們庸俗的心理，他們「不孝有三，無後爲大」的哲學，同時，除了夫人之外，奉行着討小老婆也是很有興趣的。自然在這裏反應了登報徵婚，或自殺呼救的醜態，劇作者高興的喊出了，打倒侮辱女性的男人的口號，而舞女的以自殺爲生活之道，也是給劇作者諷刺一番的。不過舞女的以自殺爲生活之道這正是社會的悲劇，正義感的作者似乎應當正面的揭穿社會的病態，不僅是譏諷一番就完事的。深刻一點説，整個的故事，没有何等深切意味的，無非是將社會現象浮面的地誇張起來，没有一點本質的檢討，而且誇張的程度，幾乎是不近情理的。</p>
<p>説到這一方面，我們以爲滑稽電影决不是無理由的胡閙。好萊塢的滑稽片已經給與我們充分的證明，那種痴人傻笑的滑稽，除了逗人發笑之外，可以説很少有藝術的價值。換句話説，假使滑稽影片就永遠如此繼續下去，那將是必然的没落。喜劇中亦應當眞實的反應現實，滑稽影片同樣應爲電影藝術的表現，因此忠實於電影藝術的作家們，毫無疑義的首先得爭取藝術的收穫。</p>
<p>「王先生的秘密」在表現技術上仍不免包含了一些缺點。劇作者或導演者的目的在於逗人發笑，可是結果因看過度的誇張，如王先生和小陳捉雞，如洗衣等，就是因着再三重複與不近情理的誇張，破壞了笑的效果。至於舞女的自殺之前，在織接法也有錯誤，犯着接不上的毛病。</p>
<p>有人説，這一影片的長處在於不以動作發笑，而是故事可笑。的確，這裏没有十分生硬的滑稽相，但是動作的誇張，到底是使作品没有成功的原因。總而言之，這一作品，在中國的滑稽片中，較有可取之處，那便是不完全以所謂滑稽面孔胡閙而已。</p>
<h3>評「春色無涯」</h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>“Ever　Green”—國泰映</p>
<p>本片首以二十五年前的簡略的敘述爲序曲，寫一個歌舞女皇海麗葛琳的一代芳名與不幸的婚姻之慘劇。導演處理女主角於成功的光榮，與愛情的燃燒中，自我犧牲的悄悄地遠走，在心理的抒寫與戲劇的空氣設置方面，都是相當成功的。</p>
<p>全劇的展開是二十五年後的今日，由一個無名的青年女伶海麗霍克絲身上發掘劇情。她在多次請求戲劇團體給予表演的機會而遭受拒絶後，被一個伯爵夫人遇見了，説她的面貌很像當年的紅伶海麗葛琳，詳細地訊問出她的身世，便以葛琳之女的資格介紹於劇塲主人，同時經一個苦於自己没有籍籍名的宣傳員湯密，在新聞紙上鼓吹，説是失踪了的某人又捲土重來了。於是隨着消息的傳佈，霍克絲學習着她母親的歌舞作風，化裝上演後竟博得很大的成功。同時也被她母親的情夫史丹斯侯爵以及她原來的父親覺察了，事情就從此糾紛起來了。</p>
<p>自然，和一般的影片一樣没有例外的是愛情的塲面，而這時的戀愛主角又自然是海麗霍克絲與年青宣傳員湯密了。</p>
<p>這時她的父親，又用着過去敲詐她母親的手段來屢次敲詐着這一對青年。她恨極了，在某次表演中自己揭穿了這一假冒事件，於是在觀衆的譁然中，在法庭的審判下，有情人成了眷屬。</p>
<p>這樣的故事，在編劇者適當的處理下，比如强調在女伶母女的遭受不幸方面，對男性特别是那個身爲丈夫，爲父親的男性，劇院的經營者，宣傳員等爲了賺錢，爲了自己成名而不惜欺騙觀衆，以及觀衆的崇拜，這些作爲深刻的批判與暴露。那末，這一劇本的成功，自然是不會狹隘於似現在那樣的普通歌舞片的。</p>
<p>就現在演出的看來，編劇者的成功是遠不及導演者的，如二十五年前的事，不能技術地插在劇的進行中，而截斷地放在片首。伯爵夫人的遇見霍克絲在湯密呌她等候機會的巧合中，也太不够技術。</p>
<p>導演Victor　Saville有着相當可取的，如以高跟鞋當香檳杯喝酒，用刀叉擊杯子作聲等這些對於貴族紳士的諷刺。雪茄烟的幾處運用等都見聰敏。鏡頭的運用與畫面的織接，也頗生動活潑，如開始寫葛琳在成功的舞台上「刻脱」到歡宴會，湯密的插雪茄烟在劇團導演卞恩的嘴裏「刻脱」到他的含着烟訓練團員。葛琳出走時在車中看着自己作臨别表演的舞台燈光的一一熄滅，等都潔淨深刻。湯密與霍克絲同宿時的兩位青年性的發洩與刻劃的畫面，剪接也比别的出之於滑稽者較爲可取。</p>
<p>演員中我覺得以演劇團導演卞恩的蓓蒂寶爾馥最佳。自然，琪茜麥佐絲的海麗霍克絲與湯密的桑尼海爾兩人的重頭戲也是不可輕視的。</p>

<h3>民族呼聲（Bordertown）（八）</h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>曼麗路克果然去告發了强尼拉米立斯，説他是迫着她，害死她丈夫的殺人犯。到了審判的那天，驚動了邊境的各處，就是落杉磯的報紙，亦都大字登載着强尼拉米立斯的名字，因爲這個時候，强尼拉米立斯的名字，知道的人已經很多了。黛兒埃惠爾亦是認識强尼的社會人物之一。强尼並且已經寫了信給她。</p>
<p>强尼拉米立斯被關在牢裏。牢卒來告訴他，有人來探望他。强尼以爲是黛兒埃惠爾哩，就跳了起來問道：「一個女人—年紀輕輕的—很美麗的？」那牢卒叱道：「不知道，你自己去看去。」强尼祇好跟了他，走出了鐵栅門。外面一個女人喊着他的小名道：「璜尼托。」不錯的，那是一個女人，但既不年輕，亦不美麗。地是他的母親。她身上披着墨西哥婦人闈的大圍巾。波斯羊皮的皮大衣，雖然由强尼早已買給了她，但她總穿不慣。陪她一同來的。還有桑諾拉城的神父。强尼竟没有想到，他的母親尚在人間，會來探望他的。他的母親摟住了他，戰戰兢兢地問題；「你没有犯那個罪吧？」强尼道：「媽媽，我没有。」</p>
<p>到了法庭裏，强尼的母親和那位神父，陪着他坐着。强尼四面張望着，但他却看不見他的心上人。一回兒，檢察官起立道：「求庭長傳第一見證—曼麗路克。」一個女監獄官將曼麗路克領了進來。她隨便裝束，一些没有打扮。她走進了證人攔裏，立了誓。檢察官就開口問她道：「在你丈夫未死之前，你認識了被告有多少時候？」曼麗應道：「八個月。」檢察官又問道：「你認識他，第一次在什麽地方？」曼麗好似没有聽見檢察官的話。她眼直直的瞪着强尼。檢察官又問道：「我問你，路克夫人，你第一次和被告見面，在什麽地方？」她還是没有聽見。全庭的人都寂然，靜待她的回答，可是她仍舊瞪着强尼不作聲。</p>
<p>審判官看着曼麗路克，覺得她面容奇怪，有些疑惑起來，就再吩咐道：「請你回答問你的話。」曼麗似乎有些聽見了。她好像很費力的，將她的眼睛從强尼的身上移開來。她開始笑起來了。她起初是細細的笑，漸漸高聲起來，以至於狂叫狂喊起來。她在狂叫之中，還夾雜了許多斷斷續續的句子，零零碎碎字眼：「他年紀輕輕……應當活着……胖胖大大的……他還是那樣胖……我看見的……强尼叫我看他的……他已經告訴了薩姆……晚上我睡覺的時候……」很顯明的，曼麗路克瘋狂了。第一見證已是無從審問，而案子亦無從進行了。</p>
<p>案子撤銷之後，强尼拉米立斯坐了自己的汽車，渡過了一片沙漠之地，來到落杉磯。時間已經晚了，但是還來得及去見黛爾埃惠爾，訴説他的愛情。他到了埃惠爾家，那個司　好像知道他的來意似的，他冷冷地説道：「埃惠爾小姐就要出門了。」强尼道：「唔，她出門，我進門。你去説一聲去。」他説着，就昂然走了進去。</p>
<p>這時黛兒埃惠爾穿着一身晚服，身上披着大衣，正從樓上走了下來。她看見强尼進來，就接着他説道：「强尼，你來了。給他們難爲了吧？」强尼笑道：「没有，没有。我心上最難過的，倒是那天没有能來踐約。」曼麗道：「那天我倒亦想到法庭裏去的，或者可以給你些精神上的帮助。不過，你知道，我的家裏一定不許我去的。你想，我有什麽法子呢？」</p>
<p>黛兒埃惠爾所説的話，或者並没有像强尼所預期的那樣親切，但是他亦不去深怪她。他説道：「好，我們一同出去吧—我們一同去吃飯去。」黛兒道：「哦，强尼，眞對不起。你來的時候，我剛要出去。我已經晚了半個鐘頭了。我要到一個正式的宴會上去—你知道，是在我們一個世交家裏。」强尼道：「那亦不要緊。我送你去。」（未完）</p>

<p>[Hankou] After receiving Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Qun on the 22nd, Chiang also received Chen Jicheng, Hao Mengling, Ye Peng, and Chen Xizeng, inquiring separately about military affairs and the state of security in Wuhan. Huang Musong is expected to arrive in Hankou on the 24th to pay respects to Chiang and report on his mission to Tibet.

Huang Jun and other representatives of Sichuan generals stationed in Hankou are also scheduled to pay respects to Chiang within the next few days to personally present matters relating to Sichuan. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] After Yu Xuezhong pays respects to Vice Zhang, he will proceed to Nanjing to pay respects to Wang. He is expected to return to Tianjin in mid-March. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Huang Musong departed for Hankou on the Jiangshun steamer at 8 a.m. on the 22nd to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Huang Musong boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangda steamer on the morning of the 22nd to go to Hankou to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, and will return to Nanjing in a few days. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Chairman Chiang summoned Zhang Qun and Chen Jicheng to his residence on the second floor of the Central Bank at 3 p.m. on the 22nd and gave them instructions. Zhang and Chen only departed at around 6 p.m. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Zhang Xueliang and his wife hosted a banquet at their official residence in Xu Jia Peng, Wuchang, at 7 p.m. on the 22nd to welcome Chairman Chiang and his wife, Soong Mei-ling. Yang Yongtai, Zhang Qun, He Chengjun, and others were invited to accompany them. Zhang personally crossed the river to Hankou at 5 p.m. on a special launch to accompany Chairman Chiang and others across the river to Xu Jia Peng. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Hankou] Mr. Tajika Shinryo, Shanghai Branch Manager of the Osaka Mainichi and Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, Mr. Onishi Hatsuo, Hankou Correspondent of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, and Mr. Okamoto Fusao, Hankou Branch Manager of the News Rengo, visited Vice Commander Zhang at the Wuchang Headquarters one after another at 10 a.m. on the 20th. Mr. Zhang granted them interviews and made the following statements successively. (Tajika asked), "I have nine questions I would like to ask the Vice Commander to answer: (1) What are your thoughts on Sino-Japanese relations? (2) How can China and Japan become friendly? (3) What are your thoughts on Japan now compared to four years ago? (4) What are your thoughts on the current situation of 'Manchukuo'? (5) How will you suppress anti-Japanese sentiment? (6) Is genuine cooperation between China, Japan, and 'Manchukuo' the greatest necessity for stability in the Orient? (7) What are your aspirations for implementing dictatorial politics in China? (8) What is China's policy on unification? (9) What is the strategy for suppressing the Communist army?" (Zhang replied), "I am willing to discuss these questions, but as a soldier, I have limitations on what I can say in my personal capacity. Chairman Chiang has already given two very detailed interviews to Japanese reporters. I am under Chairman Chiang's leadership, and his opinions naturally include my own." (Tajika asked), "Are you acquainted with Takeji Tokonami?" (Zhang replied), "Only superficially. My acquaintance with Tokonami is the same as my acquaintance with you today." (Tajika asked), "I believe Your Excellency has seen reports about the 500,000 yuan case. Can you tell us about the situation?" (Zhang replied), "This is a matter of political strife in your country and has nothing to do with me. I have always valued morality and especially respect the character of others. This is a baseless matter that concerns the reputation of others, and I absolutely cannot speak recklessly." (Tajika asked), "Are you acquainted with Akatsuka Seisuke?" (Zhang replied), "Akatsuka had a very good friendship with my father. You could say it spanned two generations. I greatly respect him as a person." (Tajika asked), "Are you acquainted with Tsuruoka Kazufumi?" (Zhang replied), "I have met many people from your country and cannot remember if I have met him. As for the questions asked by Mr. Onishi and Mr. Okamoto, they were largely the same as the above." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] According to news from this capital, the full text of Mr. Wang Chonghui's statement to Japanese reporters in Tokyo on the 20th of this month, according to a telegram from our embassy in Japan, is as follows: "I took a six-month leave of absence to return to my country half a year ago. Now that my leave is about to expire, I am returning to my post via your country. During my stay in Japan, I have no official duties, nor do I represent the government. Because I have been in my country for half a year, I have met with people from all walks of life and have a good understanding of China's attitude toward Japan. I sincerely wish to take this opportunity to convey this attitude of my country to your government and public in a private capacity, and I also wish to convey the opinions of your people to my country, as a prelude to enhancing friendship between the two countries. If I were forced to say I have a mission, this would be my mission. Otherwise, I have no so-called mission. Rumors that my opinions on politics and economics are something or other are not entirely accurate. Because my mission is as described above, I have no specific opinions to express."

<h3>The Issue of Command over the War Zone Security Team Remains to Be Decided</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Regarding the issue of command over the war zone security team, the Clearing Committee has conducted thorough discussions. In view of the precedents in the bandit areas, the administrative inspector and commissioner concurrently serves as the security commander. Therefore, the proposal that the commissioners of the Luanyu-Jimmi districts concurrently serve as the security commander to command the security team is quite powerful. At the same time, some people also believe that the Jiluan districts only have 20 counties in total, and it is enough to set up one security commander, and there is no need to set up more. The committee has submitted the above two opinions to the higher authorities for approval, so that a final decision can be made. The approval is expected to be received soon. Therefore, the date of the newly編 security team entering the war zone must wait until the problem is resolved before it can be determined. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Studies the Reorganization of National Subsidiary Currency</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Research Committee on the Reorganization of the National Subsidiary Currency System of the Ministry of Finance believes that the situation of subsidiary currency in the country is complicated. In order to unify the currency system and avoid difficulties for the people, it has a plan to reorganize the national currency system. In recent days, it has been collecting materials related to the reorganization of subsidiary currency from all parties and conducting research. A plan will be formulated soon. In addition, the Financial Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Finance will also start research on this issue. After the two committees have obtained concrete results from their research, the authorities will review and decide. At this time, there is still no concrete decision. Generally, in terms of reorganization principles, it can be divided into two categories: (1) Reorganization of copper coin subsidiary currency, (2) Reorganization of silver cent subsidiary currency. The Ministry of Finance has recently reorganized the bank registration even more rigorously, and has temporarily set three methods: (1) Consult the provincial and municipal governments and order the direct subordinate agencies to ban banks that have been established but not registered and order them to fulfill the legal procedures. (2) All new banks that apply to provincial and municipal governments for establishment must be ordered to register with the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the regulations before they can open for business. (3) Request all banking associations to refuse membership to unregistered banks in order to identify them. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy and Hirota's Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Hull previously gave a speech to the Canadian Council in New York. "President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy is centered on relations with the Far East... It is quite similar to the Atlantic and Pacific issues. The method of agreed-upon meetings seeks political and economic stability, and the maintenance of peace through non-aggression and reduction of armaments." He also said, "There are also our territories and possessions on the vast Pacific Ocean... Such as the Open Door Policy, which has long been clearly stipulated by treaties... And it is a way to maintain peace in the Far East and the Pacific... Such as the Washington Treaty, which has been very effective... We still deeply believe in and abide by it..." Such a proposition is indeed based on the spirit of peace in its words. It reiterates that the United States' diplomacy towards the Far East should at least be given equal importance as its diplomacy towards Western Europe. Although its specific strategies are unknowable, its principles have been expressed without a doubt.</p>
<p>The United States has been pursuing the Monroe Doctrine for more than a century. In the past, it did not want to intervene in events outside the Americas and was also unable to do so. Therefore, the United States had no expression other than observation in the complex and complicated European issues. However, since the sudden outbreak of the European War in 1914, the national power of the United States has suddenly expanded. Its economic relations have expanded from South America to the countries of the European continent. During the war, the United States invested more than 10 billion U.S. dollars in European countries. All major European countries have close economic ties with the United States. However, after the war, European countries were exhausted. The situation of their mutual opposition and conflict is also very complicated. For more than ten years, the United States has only watched from the sidelines and has not taken any actions to resolve the difficulties. There are reasons for this. It is not necessarily all because it has been isolated for a long time and is not accustomed to international diplomacy.</p>
<p>The issue of war debt repayment is one of the stumbling blocks between Britain and the United States. At the same time, it also often causes unhappiness between the United States and France. Since the debt cannot be recovered, it is difficult to establish the economic prosperity of the United States. If the period of panic is prolonged, it will eventually lead to huge disasters that are difficult to resolve. For the sake of the United States, the only way to resolve the current difficulties is to find another market outside of Europe. There is one place. Although it is not enough to provide for the expansion of the United States in the short term, it is indeed very promising in the future, that is, the Far East. The international relations in the Far East are simpler than those in Western Europe, and it is an undeveloped area. It is not like Europe, where manufacturing industries have reached their peak. Even Japan, a country that claims to be gradually advancing to heavy industry, often imports about 200 million Japanese yen worth of steel machinery every year. The United States accounts for a major position in automobiles, machinery, and steel. Japan is like this, not to mention the other countries that can provide for the United States's unlimited development. This is why the United States must adhere to the Open Door Policy, in order to retain the Far East market and use it as a place for future economic development. However, first there is the lack of coordination between Britain and the United States in the Far East, followed by the opposition between Japan and the United States. Once the Soviet Union rises in Eastern Europe and is now extending its strategy to Siberia, the four powers of Britain, the United States, Japan, and the Soviet Union form a quadrilateral power. It is even more difficult for the United States to actively develop the East Asian market.</p>
<p>Japan has recently been advocating equality in armaments. The so-called equality in armaments does not mean that Germany wants to obtain the same strength as Britain and the United States in the army and air force. Japan's army can be called the first in the Far East, with no opponents. What it is fighting for is the equality of naval power. Since the abolition of the naval holiday, Japan has been preparing to build ships freely in two years, without being restricted by treaties. In other words, it will no longer be bound by the Washington Treaty.</p>
<p>However, the current Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota is still touting the slogan of "moral" diplomacy. He is singing peace with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, as if he really wants to make the Pacific calm. We will not ask about the content of moral diplomacy, but will try to study the current situation in Japan. First, the democratic meaning of parliamentary politics has been completely lost. The credibility of political parties has been destroyed. The power of the military has increased. Most ordinary Japanese people believe in the authority of the military. Second, military expenditure accounts for 49% of Japan's total national treasury expenditure, and the extraordinary period will continue to be extended. It is said that it will continue to be extended until at least 1938. To what extent will military expenditure be increased? We dare not underestimate the situation. Then the so-called peaceful diplomacy is just a term in diplomatic negotiations. Recalling the eve of the European War, Germany also once touted armed peace. However, its peace was a peace protected by arms. Today's Pacific situation is also similar.</p>

<h3>Xiao Shuyu's Opinions on Rural Relief</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Legislative member Xiao Shuyu wrote an article on the poverty and relief of rural areas, which he distributed to all legislative members and domestic scholars. He advocated: (1) The central government should designate a county within Jiangsu Province as an agricultural experimental area, and appoint a special commissioner to be responsible for the experimental work, free from all administrative constraints. (2) The county government should add an agriculture and forestry section or an agriculture and forestry bureau to specialize in land reclamation loans, water conservancy cooperation, agricultural improvement and other matters. (3) Each township in the county should send an agricultural instructor to organize an office, with agricultural loan offices, rent and storage offices for plows and farm tools, agricultural product marketing offices, land reclamation offices, orphanage relief offices, job guidance and seedling storage offices, and agricultural warehouses. The experimental fee should be 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, with 50% for loans, 20% for land reclamation and afforestation, 5% for purchasing plows and farm tools, 10% for improving agricultural production, 10% for water conservancy construction, and 5% for temporary expenses. The outline of the work is investigation, statistics, loans, savings, land reclamation, afforestation, water conservancy, pest control, renting out plows, rural treatment of sick livestock, improving agricultural production, and marketing agricultural products.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Formulate Unified Local Collection Methods</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] To streamline local finances and unify local collection agencies, the Ministry of Finance has drafted methods to be sent to the provincial governments, ordering the finance departments to formulate detailed rules. A copy will also be submitted to the Executive Yuan for record. The original report states that the three methods for unifying local collection agencies, as resolved by the Second National Financial Conference, were sent to the provincial governments in June of last year, ordering the provincial finance departments to implement them. Subsequently, fifteen provinces, including Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Henan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei, Qinghai, Hebei, Chahar, and Ningxia, successively reported on the situation. Among them, Shaanxi and Yunnan provinces achieved the best results in actual unified collection. In Shaanxi, all collections are handled by the county governments, while in Yunnan, they are generally handled by the finance bureaus. Jiangxi Province also has a unified scale. The remaining provinces, such as Anhui, Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, and Hubei, either collect through county governments or finance bureaus, or continue the old practice of contracted merchants. As for Guizhou, Gansu, Chahar, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces, either the situation is special, or reforms need to be added. The Ministry originally intended to focus on the principle of unification, consider the circumstances, and formulate interim measures as a standard for promotion. Appropriately, the Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 2562 on January 25th, approving the letter from the Chief of the Military Affairs Commission's Headquarters, sending the outline of the methods for abolishing bureaus and changing to sections in bandit suppression provinces, which was reviewed by the four ministries of internal affairs, finance, real estate, and education, and submitted to the Yuan Affairs Conference, passed as proposed, and sent to the Central Political Committee for record, and submitted to the National Government for record, and handed over to the Legislative Yuan for reference. Article 7 of the original outline stipulates that the reform principle of county financial affairs is in line with the financial conference. The above-mentioned provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan are all within the bandit suppression area and should comply with the original methods of Shaanxi, which are also the same. The remaining provinces should also formulate implementation rules based on this outline to promote them together. The Ministry originally intended to formulate separate methods, the meaning of which is also the same. In addition to copying the original outline of the methods and the fifth item of the main points of the original letter, it is sent to the provincial governments for reference, ordering the finance departments to refer to the original case, formulate detailed rules, order compliance, and report to the Ministry for record, no later than the start of the budget year of the 24th year, to report all the information. Accordingly, I respectfully request your review and record. (22nd day special telegram)</p>
<h3>Zhou Lanhai, Who Forged Xie Chi's Letter and Seal, Detained by Executive Yuan</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] The Executive Yuan has repeatedly received reports that there are impostors posing as members of the Yuan outside, and there are also people donating money in the name of Chu Minyi.

<h3>Jiangxi Province Allowed to Levy Tobacco, Alcohol, and Tooth Tax</h3>

The tobacco and alcohol merchants of the province believed that the tooth tax was one of the exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes that the central government had stipulated to abolish, and jointly appealed to the government to send personnel to investigate the situation in Jiangxi Province. Jiangxi Province was allowed to levy tobacco and alcohol tooth tax due to its special circumstances, but no more license tax could be levied. The tooth tax will be suspended when the newly promulgated business tax is popularized. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>International Arms Control Convention</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Asks Senate for Unconditional Approval</p>
<p>Aims to Prevent Naval Conflicts in the Persian Gulf</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt today sent a message to the Senate, requesting unconditional approval of the international arms control treaty. At a time of international naval tension, the President's move is particularly noteworthy. It is said that the President intends to find ways to prevent conflicts between naval powers even in the far-off Persian Gulf. The Senate approved the treaty last year, but with reservations. The President's current request is for unconditional approval of the treaty signed in Switzerland in 1925. The reservation last year was proposed by Senator King, namely that the United States' compliance with the treaty should not be construed as denying Persia's sovereignty over the Persian Gulf. The State Department could not accurately interpret King's intentions, but some quarters feared that Britain would oppose this reservation, as British ships have been patrolling the Persian Gulf for years. The President probably does not want to cause diplomatic conflict between Britain and the United States, especially since the two countries have had disagreements recently on proposals for international control of the arms industry. In the Geneva Arms Committee, the US representative strongly advocated that the control of the arms industry should be handled by a neutral organization formed by various countries. This proposal has many supporters, and even Canada sides with the US against Britain. Therefore, the White House requests unconditional passage of the arms treaty so that the Geneva conference will not be affected. King has not explained in detail what he had in mind when he proposed the reservation, but the government does not want minor matters to hinder the overall situation. Leaders close to the White House in the Senate expect the President's proposal to pass quickly. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Austrian Chancellor's First Visit to Paris Since Taking Office</h3>
<p>Temporarily Alights Outside City, French Premier Personally Welcomes Guest</p>
<p>Left-Wing Groups Demonstrate at Station, 800 Arrested</p>
<p>Talks to Cover London Agreement Framework</p>
<p>Austria Seeks British and French Aid for Independence Guarantee</p>
<p>[Paris] Austrian Chancellor Dr. Kurt Schuschnigg visited Paris for the first time since taking office. To avoid hostile demonstrations at the station, he got off the train outside Paris and took a car into the city. The military police gathered at the station resembled a fortress. In addition to a large contingent of police, there were patrol teams with rifles and helmets, forming a defensive line outside the station to prevent unauthorized persons from crossing. The authorities are likely taking the assassination of King Alexander of Yugoslavia into consideration, so the precautions are unusually strict. Military police arrested over 800 people outside the station. Anyone who was slow to comply with the order to "move forward" was at risk of being arrested. An hour before the Austrian Chancellor's train arrived, a crowd had gathered outside the station. By then, over 500 people had already been arrested. Most of them were young people who had come to the station to demonstrate against the Austrian Chancellor at the call of the Socialist Communist Party. At 9:11 PM, the Vienna train arrived, and the crowd was greatly disappointed to learn that the Austrian Chancellor was not on the train. When Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Walterberger alighted from the train outside Paris, French Premier Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval personally welcomed them. They then traveled together by car to the hotel. Observers view the Austrian Chancellor's visit as primarily a matter of protocol, just like his recent visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. However, his talks with the French authorities are also of great importance, as they will cover the framework of the major negotiations initiated by the recent Anglo-French agreement, and the Danube Pact is also part of the security guarantees under discussion. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Franco-Austrian Talks Begin</h3>
<p>[Paris] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger met with Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval this morning, and the meeting ended at 11:10 AM. This visit by the Austrian officials is of a courtesy nature and not an exchange of opinions, but the two sides talked for over an hour, presumably reviewing various issues in brief in order to discuss them in detail later. In the afternoon, they will meet again at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After parting with Flandin and Laval, the Austrian officials went to the Presidential Palace for a luncheon hosted by President and Mrs. Lebrun. Key figures in diplomatic and political circles, such as Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval, were among those invited. Before the luncheon, the President awarded the Austrian officials the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Franco-Austrian talks will inevitably involve the London Agreement, which reiterates the principles of the Rome Agreement regarding the security of the Danube and the non-interference pact, which are of great concern to Austria. The Soviet note stated that 70% of the people of Europe support the London Agreement, and this is indeed the case. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] This morning, officials from both countries held a meeting and gathered for a banquet at the palace at noon. Their discussions included Austria's political and economic situation and various issues related to the Danube. Reports suggest that the issue of the Habsburg restoration was also discussed. However, the "Wolff Bureau" reported that while the restoration issue is being discussed extensively in Austria, the current government is not actively promoting this movement. However, Schuschnigg advocates not suppressing this issue, as it creates a balance between the National Socialist Party and the monarchists. Therefore, Schuschnigg will express to the French government that he does not support the immediate restoration of the monarchy. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Visits Britain and France Seeking Equal Status</h3>
<p>[Paris] The press is commenting on the visit of Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Berger. "L'Action Française" wrote, "The two Austrian politicians are visiting Paris first, then London, and will discuss various important issues with British and French politicians. One issue that will certainly be discussed is that since the Great War, Austria has always played a passive role on the political stage. Now the Vienna government is eager to break free from this position and intends to seek a path to development while fulfilling the Rome Agreement, so that Austria can be guaranteed by other countries on the one hand, and can also guarantee the countries that guarantee Austria on the other. In other words, Austria wants to join the group of powers with equal rights, and wants to retain absolute freedom in its political relations with its neighbors. Only in this way can Austria be said to be gradually achieving equal status, especially moving towards a policy of multilateral cooperation and opposing bilateral cooperation. The so-called bilateral cooperation is a policy that is contrary to international conventions, which is what the Rome Agreement seeks to correct." (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Resisting Foreign Aggression and Suppressing the Expansion of German Influence</h3>
<p>[Paris] Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Austrian Foreign Minister Walter Berger had lengthy talks with the French Prime Minister, and consulted on the peaceful issues of the Anglo-French London Declaration. However, the most important thing is the Anglo-French guarantee of Austria's independence. It is generally said that the purpose of Schuschnigg and Berger's visits to France and Britain is to seek international assistance to suppress the expansion of German influence, and at the same time, other than Italy, only Britain and France can help Austria resist foreign political and territorial aggression.

<h3>Laval Meets with Ambassadors from Five Countries</h3>
<p>London Suggests Maintaining Contact</p>
<p>Germany's Attitude is a Key Factor</p>
<p>[Paris] Before the Austrian Prime Minister arrived, French Foreign Minister Laval had consulted with the British, Russian, German, Italian, and Polish ambassadors several times. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Laval met separately today with the Italian, Polish, and German ambassadors to France. The talks were clearly related to the London Agreement. Since yesterday's British cabinet meeting and the Soviet government's note to the British and French governments, there seems to be considerable progress on the point of maintaining mutual contact regarding the various proposals in the Anglo-French London Declaration. During yesterday's London cabinet meeting, the British government confirmed that the London Agreement is a complete plan, and no part of it should be allowed to be separated. It would be inappropriate for Germany's reply to selectively interpret the Air Pact. Later, the note from the Moscow government further indicated that a major European country is willing to provide strong support for this claim (that the various parts of the London Agreement cannot be separated), which is of utmost importance. As for the procedures that countries will follow to conduct negotiations, so that a consensus can be reached on the overall issue in the end, the French side believes that this is a secondary issue. According to reports in British newspapers, after Simon, the British Foreign Secretary, goes to Berlin, he will continue to Moscow via Warsaw, and this news is greatly appreciated here. France has close ties with the Soviet Union and Poland, and is very pleased to see another friendly great power visit the Soviet Union and Poland, thereby increasing the universal nature of the London Agreement. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Office Studies Soviet Documents</h3>
<p>East European Pact Network Constitutes a Security Factor</p>
<p>Cannot be Effective if Germany and Poland do not Participate</p>
<p>[London] The Soviet government's note on the February 3rd London Declaration is currently being studied in detail by the Foreign Office. According to general observations, the network of pacts among Eastern European countries has become an important factor in security. However, Lithuania and its southeastern neighbors (i.e., Germany and Poland) have not yet signed pacts. If this shortcoming can be remedied, Eastern European security will be even more effective. It is said that people in diplomatic circles are now considering this, which is why rumors are circulating that British officials will stop in Poland on their way from Berlin to Moscow. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Italy Prepared for any Eventuality</h3>
<p>On East European Mutual Assistance Pact</p>
<p>Italian View is the Same as Britain's</p>
<p>[Rome] After Germany sent its reply to the Anglo-French proposals, Italian public opinion unanimously stated that the European situation is becoming chaotic and uncertain. The Supreme Defense Council issued a communiqué yesterday, announcing that Italy is prepared for any eventuality, with the intention of reassuring the public. "Foreign Affairs Daily" stated, "Germany's reply indicates that it neither refuses to participate in the fundamental issues, nor does it want to cooperate sincerely. Germany's method is to separate the Air Pact from other issues. However, Britain firmly believes that the East European Mutual Assistance Pact should be freely discussed by the countries concerned, but Britain itself is not bound by it. Italy's view is generally the same as Britain's." The "Genoa Labor News" stated, "It is absolutely impossible to only sign the Air Pact and ignore other issues, because it is not enough to secure the Franco-German border, it is necessary to ensure that other nations no longer fear German aggression." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Changing Situation in East Africa, Italian War Preparations Intensify</h3>
<p>Expedition Commander has already Set Off</p>
<p>Japan Indicates it will Definitely not Assist Abyssinia against Italy</p>
<p>Coastal Highway under Construction in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>[Rome] Italy's military precautionary measures for East Africa have not stopped. Italian troops and military supplies are continuously being transported to East Africa to prepare for war with Abyssinia. The 19th Division stationed in Florence will soon be transferred to southern Italian ports to join the 29th Reserve Division currently in Messina, and will be sent to East Africa when necessary. In addition, it is rumored that another large number of troops will set sail from Naples tomorrow. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Naples: The Italian postal ship "Vulcano", carrying 400 industrial specialists, 700 engineers and sanitation soldiers, and various supplies, is scheduled to set sail from here tomorrow evening for Italian East African colonies (i.e., Eritrea and Italian Somaliland). It will stop briefly at Messina to load more than 1,000 troops stationed there before departing. The commander of the Italian expedition, General Graziani, is also embarking on this ship. He is the youngest general to have earned medals for meritorious service. Previously, the locals in Cyrenaica, Italian Libya, did not submit and often caused disturbances. He was ordered to suppress them, and the entire region was eventually pacified. In the battle of Saisan, the Italian army captured the ancient Fara well in the desert, which was also Graziani's achievement. When he set off today, Crown Prince Vittorio Emanuele III personally saw him off. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shigemitsu, went to Norway today to participate in the Olympic Committee meeting. Before leaving, he told a Reuters reporter that if Italy and Abyssinia go to war, Japan will definitely not assist Abyssinia. Recently, Japan's friendly relations with Abyssinia have intensified, leading to rumors that Japan is preparing to assist Abyssinia against Italy. Shigemitsu's statement is reassuring. At the same time, Italian war preparations continue unabated. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>US Giant Bombers Fly Across Continent in Formation</h3>
<p>From the East Coast of the Pacific to Washington</p>
<p>Preparations Completed</p>
<p>San Diego: Preparations for the flight of twelve giant US bombers to Washington were completed today. This is the final step from Washington to the Panama Canal Zone. The Martin giant aircraft used this time are the same as those used in the recent formation flight from Washington to Alaska and back to San Diego. This non-stop round-trip flight from San Diego to San Rafael, California, is a test flight, covering a distance of 1,200 miles. Its purpose is to familiarize the pilots with the difficulties of flying to Panama. These giant bombers have a speed of 260 miles per hour, and each can carry 400 gallons of gasoline and thousands of pounds of bombs. Since completing the flight to Alaska, students from the Army Aviation School have been flying them from Rockwell Airfield here to the sea for practice flights. Pilots learn to fly blind, fly far from land, and search for ships at sea using radio and other signals emitted from the flying school. This training was invented by the Army Aviation Department to expand the US coastal defense and extend it deep into the ocean. Although these aircraft have flown thousands of miles over the sea, they have no floatation devices. However, each has two engines, and one engine can keep the aircraft flying in the air. In the future, when flying to Panama, they will communicate with land stations and ships at sea. This flight is intended to test the Army's radio equipment as much as possible. It is said that General McClelland will be in charge of this flight. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>More Details on the British Airship Accident, Sisters Die for Love in the Air</h3>
<p>[London] The two daughters of the American Consul General to Naples, Mr. Bowers, both died in a plane crash. It is widely believed that this is related to the British airship accident near Messina, Italy last week. The younger daughter, Miss Gahan, 20 years old, was engaged to Air Force officer Mr. Forbes, who died in the airship. The elder sister, Elizabeth, 23, was also engaged to another Air Force officer, Mr. Petty, who was also killed in the accident. According to friends of the two daughters, they had been depressed and restless in recent days. They recently hired a plane to travel from England to France for a short trip to relieve their emotions. Unexpectedly, when flying over Essex, they both crashed in a field and died instantly, following their fiancés to the afterlife. Two sealed letters were found in the plane and have been handed over to the London police. The mother of the two daughters said after receiving the bad news that she did not know why her daughters did this. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Quezon Carries Philippine Constitution Draft to US via Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Philippine Senate President Quezon is silent about Washington's approval of the Philippine Constitution, but he is confident that it will not encounter difficulties. Quezon and his delegation of Philippine dignitaries, traveling on the President Coolidge to the United States, passed through here today. Quezon said that he sees no reason why the draft constitution should not be approved, as government approval of the case does not conflict with precedent. If a responsible government can be established, the Philippines will definitely enjoy its benefits. He hopes that the new constitution can take effect before the end of this year. Philippine Governor Murphy, who is currently in the United States meeting with President Roosevelt, recently stated here that he considers the Philippine Constitution drafted by the special conference to be a model code.

<h3>President of Tokyo Yomiuri Newspaper Stabbed and Seriously Wounded</h3>
<p>Advocating Constitutionalism, Hated by Right-Wing Groups</p>
<p>Perpetrator Surrenders, Confesses to being Leader of Bushinkai</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At 8:40 AM on February 22nd, Yomiuri Newspaper President Matsutaro Shoriki was about to enter the editorial office at the Yomiuri Newspaper Company in Ginza West 3rd Street when he was suddenly attacked by a suspicious man of about 30 years of age and stabbed with a short knife. He suffered a serious wound to the left neck, 15 cm long and 8 cm deep. Staff in the building immediately sent him to Tsukiji Hayashi Hospital for emergency treatment, but due to excessive bleeding, he is becoming increasingly weak and his life is in danger. The perpetrator surrendered on the spot and was taken to the Marunouchi Police Station. He confessed that his name is Katsusuke Nagasaki and that he belongs to a right-wing ideological group. It is said that the reason for his actions was that the Yomiuri Newspaper recently published an article supporting Dr. Minobe's constitutional theory advocated in the Diet. The company also used a large amount of national funds to invite an American professional baseball team, and President Shoriki was involved in the Tokyo city jail incident, etc. Nagasaki is currently the youth leader of the Bushinkai. The Bushinkai is a right-wing group that advocates royal centralism and has intimidated the Tokyo Nichinichi Newspaper and the Hochi Newspaper. It is a group that the Metropolitan Police Department is guarding against. (Domei News, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Yomiuri Newspaper President Matsutaro Shoriki, who was stabbed at 8:40 AM this morning, is still being treated in the company. He underwent a second blood transfusion at 6:00 PM and is doing better. Shoriki previously served as the chief of the Metropolitan Police Department's General Affairs Division. After retiring, he became the president of Yomiuri. He is also a powerful member of the Banchokai and is close to the protagonist of the rayon case of the Seiyukai, and is a liaison figure between political parties and financial groups. The fascists hate him to the bone. After being released from prison, he wrote about constitutionalism, which led to this assassination attempt. The perpetrator is Katsusuke Nagasaki, the youth leader of the Bushinkai. After the attack, he surrendered himself. (Chinese United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Hirota Answers Questions from Yoshizawa, Explains Policy Towards Russia</h3>
<p>First Resolve Various Pending Issues</p>
<p>Then Conclude a Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota gave the following answers to questions from Kenkichi Yoshizawa (Friends Club) at the secret meeting of the General Budget Committee of the House of Peers yesterday afternoon: (1) Regarding the Russian-Manchurian border defense issue, Japan is originally an island nation and is therefore overly sensitive. If it were in Europe or the United States, border defense would be a matter of course. The Soviet Union is also carrying out defense with this in mind. However, the border defense that Japan is considering is different from what the Soviet Union is considering. However, Japan cannot but give appropriate consideration to the Soviet Union's more than necessary defense. (2) There are two ways to conclude a treaty: (1) to conclude a treaty after resolving various issues between the two countries, and (2) to begin resolving pending issues after concluding a treaty. I believe that it is most appropriate for Japan and Russia to conclude a non-aggression treaty after resolving pending issues. (3) Establishing peace in the Far East is what the government is striving for most. Some people suspect that Japan will unite with Britain or the United States to achieve this goal. I do not advocate establishing a special relationship with any one country. I intend to continue friendly relations with all countries. It is Japan's fundamental policy to establish peace in the Far East by maintaining friendly relations with any country without uniting with one country to oppress another. We will continue to work towards this in the future. (Dentsu News, 22nd)</p>

<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Declares No Change in Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>Hoover Criticizes New Deal as a Pre-Election Ploy</p>
<p>[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today at a press conference that the government is currently satisfied with its monetary policy and does not wish to make any changes. The government will continue to work along its current path. Although former President Hoover advocates restoring the gold standard and stabilizing the dollar at its current value, the government does not intend to alter its course. Hoover's remarks did not generate much interest today, so the markets remain unexciting. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Former President Hoover's statement yesterday in Tucson on restoring the gold standard was only a fleeting moment. Washington has returned to calm today. Most quarters consider Hoover's statement to be the opening salvo of his 1936 presidential campaign. Republican leaders have remained silent on the matter, but it is said that the conservative elements of the party also regard Hoover as their leader. Some political observers believe that Hoover's statement aims to make restoring the gold standard the platform of the Republican Party's 1936 presidential campaign, while others believe that Hoover merely intends to offer his personal judgment to the country. The New Deal faction immediately launched a counter-reaction. Senator Lenna LaRoux attacked Hoover in the Senate, criticizing Hoover for hastily criticizing his resumption of the presidency and stating that Hoover's policies were those that led to the collapse of his government.

<h3>Roosevelt Encourages People to Eat Fish</h3>
<p>Glamorous Women's Parade as a Promotional Campaign</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt has recently appointed former physical education professor McFadden to conduct a nationwide promotional campaign to encourage people to eat more fish and increase fish consumption. McFadden will serve as a member of the Department of Commerce's advisory committee, leading a large group of beautiful women to travel around the country, so that people in the interior can witness the beauty and realize the practical benefits of eating fish, which are beneficial to both health and beautification. According to the Department of Commerce, Americans tend to prefer meat. Although eating fish can supplement food, it cannot replace meat. Americans currently eat an average of 15 pounds of fish per person per year, while Japanese people eat 55 pounds and Swedes eat as much as 50 pounds. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Vegetarian Diet in the Countryside Leads to Longevity</h3>
<p>Centenarians Abound in Bulgaria</p>
<p>[Vienna] Bulgaria is a country of long-lived people. The country has a population of only six million, but according to official surveys, there are 162 people over the age of one hundred. This percentage of long-lived people is unique in the world. In addition, there are probably three or four hundred people who claim to be one hundred years old but have not actually confirmed their age. The reasons for such longevity are currently being studied by doctors and scientists and are quite interesting. First, all the people in Bulgaria who are over one hundred years old are farmers. None of them live in cities, and most of them are shepherds in the mountains. From this, it can be seen that the difficult and arduous life in the mountains is enough to improve people's health. Secondly, these centenarians are not tall or strong. At the same time, they marry very early, mostly between the ages of twenty and twenty-five. Almost none of them marry after the age of thirty-five. They also have many children, averaging 7.4. Vegetarianism seems to be related to longevity. Among these 162 people, 95 percent never eat meat, 3 percent occasionally taste meat, and only 2 percent eat meat and vegetables together. About 80 percent have the habit of drinking alcohol, while only 20 percent do not drink alcohol, so alcohol does not have a major impact on human health. As for tobacco, most do not smoke. Among these 161 people, 85 are women and 77 are men. Among them, there is a shepherd who is currently 121 years old and is still as strong as ever. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Secret of the Night-Flying Man Is Uncovered</h3>
<p>Merchant Wanted to Sell an Island for a Good Price</p>
<p>Norwegian Military Police Investigation Cost a Lot</p>
<p>Norwegian City The secret of the night-flying man, which was widely reported in the newspapers last year, has now been uncovered. Last year, the Norwegian newspapers had numerous reports about this mysterious aviator, saying that he was flying along the northern coast of Norway at night, but it was difficult to find his whereabouts. However, it has now been discovered that the rumor was actually fabricated by a merchant. Several years ago, the merchant obtained ownership of an island called "Jan Mayen." The island is located in the sea north of Norway. The merchant then thought of selling the island to the Norwegian government and fantasized about creating all kinds of sensational news to attract the attention of the Norwegian government authorities, so they would know that the island had value as an aviation base. It is said that the merchant even contacted the Soviet Russian and Japanese authorities to threaten the Norwegian government, so they would know that other governments had covetous intentions. After the merchant's secret was discovered, the Norwegian government has begun an investigation and may file a lawsuit against the merchant, because after the news of the night-flying man spread, the Norwegian army, navy, and police spent a lot of money on investigating and patrolling the matter.

Next, Huang and Yu respectively presented wreaths, and the entire group silently paid their respects to the tower statue. Yu Jishi then gave a report, stating that the reason why the memorial tower was scheduled to be unveiled on the 22nd was that the 88th Division was serving on the front lines in the Jiangwan Temple area on this day, fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy, which was one of the fiercest and most sacrificial battles. Recalling the past events, he felt even more grief. Next, Provincial Chairman Huang delivered a speech, saying that the soldiers of the 88th Division who died in the battle were eternally remembered along with the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. Next, Provincial Party Representative Wang Tingyang, 88th Division Deputy Commander Feng Shengfa, and the division's special party representative Chen Zhicheng delivered speeches on behalf of the entire division.

<p>An Overview of the Transformations in Xinjiang in Recent Years (1)</p>
<p>Xinjiang is isolated and located in a remote region, nestled between the two major powers of Britain and the Soviet Union. Its borders directly abut foreign countries, stretching over four thousand hundreds of miles. Since 1931 (Western calendar), with the successful construction of the Turkestan-Siberia Railway by the Soviet Union, connecting to the Siberian Railway, the northwestern part of Xinjiang, namely the heartland of the new province, has become increasingly entrapped in a situation where others are near while we are far, others are at ease while we are burdened. Xinjiang's diplomacy has always been arduous, and now, with the rapid evolution of the international situation, it is even more difficult, needless to say. Looking back at the internal residents, the ethnic groups are extremely complex. In the southern part of the Tianshan Mountains, they are called "Chantou" and "Brut," which constitute the majority. In the northern part of the Tianshan Mountains, they are called Mongol, Kazakh, and Hui (also known as Gan Hui or Han Hui; the Chantou are called Dungan), which constitute the majority. As for the Manchus, Solons, Sibos, Andijanis, Tunguses (a mixed race of Han Chinese and Turks), and naturalized Russians, etc., scattered in the north and south of Xinjiang, their numbers are also considerable. Not to mention the resident foreigners from the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States, Portugal, the Netherlands, India, Turkey, etc. The Han Chinese residing among them are but a small fraction. In terms of residents, it is nothing less than a world exhibition of human races.</p>
<p>Due to geographical relations, Xinjiang is vulnerable to the direct influence of international politics, economy, and other factors. Internally, due to the complexity of residents and the diversity of beliefs, governance is inherently more difficult. In addition, culture is backward, customs are backward and closed, and indigenous people especially like to adhere to the old ways. Since the establishment of schools in the early Republic, government offices have mostly regarded them as mere formalities, and the people have even considered their children's entry into schools as corvée labor, often closing their doors tightly and refusing to comply. As a result, after more than twenty years of educational founding, it still only has a rudimentary form, with no progress. In terms of national character, it is like any other nation in the world, with both strengths and weaknesses. The Kazakhs are naturally strong and belligerent. The Chantou people are docile and hardworking, and usually amiable like family members. However, their cultural knowledge is at a lower level, and they are fond of excitement and easily swayed by "chieftains." One call brings thousands of responses, making it easy to cause incidents. The Qianlong era, the Guangxu era, and the recent years of popular revolts in various counties are evidence of this. Since the residents of Xinjiang are of mixed races, and their nature is ignorant and fond of excitement, if governance is flawed, it will cause major changes, often leading to disasters that last for several years. The history of previous generations can be seen from the historical records. Since diplomatic problems will become increasingly difficult, local authorities should be cautious in their actions, and the central government must quickly plan effective strategies for consolidating border defenses and stabilizing the hinterland, providing timely instructions. As the saying goes, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. This is precisely the time to do so. In order to clarify the facts of the past for future measures to learn from, I will review the past events and write this article.</p>
<p>Yang Zengxin, the former chairman of Xinjiang, had been in office in Xinjiang for many years and knew the local situation very well. When he governed Xinjiang, the policies he implemented were tailored to the local conditions, bordering on fooling the people, resulting in mixed praise and criticism. During Yang's seventeen years in Xinjiang, the area was pacified, the people lived in peace, residents could sleep peacefully, and travelers had no worries on the road. During the Republic of China years five and six, the spirit of his politics was especially commendable. It is a pity that he devoted himself to metaphysics in his later years, seeming to be deluded by the doctrine of "inaction," and failed to take advantage of the opportunity to plan fundamental strategies for consolidating border defenses and raising the culture of the frontier, which was a great mistake. However, Yang still had a self-awareness, once saying, "I only know to obey the central government and do not ask who is in power." During the Beijing government era, he supported it. In the autumn of 1928, when the Northern Expeditionary Army settled in Tianjin, he also telegraphed his support for the National Government and reorganized the provincial government, raising the flag with the blue sky, white sun, and red earth. This shows that he knew that the province could not survive independently from the central government. Yang had considered this carefully. Yang, over sixty years old, once had the intention to retire, but was hesitant due to the province's finances and the selection of a proxy. Instead, he pledged himself with the eight characters "Loyal to Xinjiang, End in Xinjiang." Not long after, he was unfortunately assassinated by his subordinates Fan Yaonan and Zhang Chunxi, who wanted to innovate, while attending the graduation ceremony of the political and legal school. At that time, Jin Shuren, the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, quelled the chaos and succeeded as chairman, concurrently serving as the border defense supervisor of Xinjiang. His initial measures also followed the old rules, but Jin's political skills were far inferior to Yang's. During his four or five years in office, he made no achievements and ultimately stepped down in disgrace in 1933 in the so-called "April 12 Incident." According to the formation of this coup, the establishment of a county in Hami and the rebellion of the mountain Chantou were a powerful fuse, but in terms of the establishment of the county, it does not seem to be entirely unjustified. During the Qing Dynasty, the Hami Chantou were governed by a Jasak prince. The prince was enfeoffed because "Bo Ke Erbeidolela" of Hami had contributed to capturing the Jungars during the Qianlong era. The Qing court enfeoffed him as a first-class Jasak prince. In the early Tongzhi period, when the prince "Bo Xier" was martyred, the Qing court also conferred the title of hereditary prince and allowed him to eat his own fiefdoms and have a national salary. According to the Xinjiang Chronicles, in the Ming Dynasty, his subordinates were originally divided into two kings, Loyal and Obedient, within and outside the mountains. Although they later belonged to one king, the thoughts and behaviors of the people within and outside the mountains were fundamentally different. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the hereditary system was still continued. Yuan Shikai, in his plot to become emperor, added the title of "Shamu Husote" twin prince, namely the so-called Sha prince. The Sha prince was autocratic and greedy, and the corvée and taxes were heavy. He strictly controlled the wasteland within Hami, not only not allowing Han Chinese to reclaim it, but also not allowing Chantou people to cultivate it. Whenever he saw fertile land or strong cattle and sheep, he would seize them. There were often additional charges for checking the land and collecting rent every year. Many sheep were not allowed to be less after the autumn check. If they were less, they would be heavily fined as usual. The herders were exploited and had fewer sheep. In order to cleverly avoid heavy fines, they had to turn to each other and gather together to make up the number. His harsh collection and harming of the people was like this. Therefore, the awakened elements of his subordinates had long harbored the intention to rebel. In July 1929 and June 1930, they rose up in resistance twice, but were quelled by the concession of the prince's palace. In July of that year, the Chantou people spontaneously petitioned to change to return to the central government, eager to break away from the bondage of the Hui prince and pay taxes in the same way as the Han Chinese, so as to avoid the prince's demands. At that time, when the Sha prince passed away, the young prince Nie Zier succeeded to the throne, who was addicted to alcohol and smoking, which violated the religious regulations and did not win the hearts of the people. Jin regarded Hami as the gateway to the new province, where there was wasteland everywhere, and the refugees from Gansu who fled to Xinjiang were constantly streaming in. For the sake of reclaiming wasteland and populating the border, he accepted the request of the Chantou people and sent officials to investigate the land and household registration, dividing Hami into the three counties of Yi Wu, Yi He, and Hami in October. The young prince Nie Zier then went to the province himself, requesting more support for the Gongeer land and winter and summer grazing grounds. This is the origin of the change of governance in Hami and Nie Zier's entry into the province. Yao Le Bo Shi, who was serving as the commander of the Five Prefectures "Bo Ke" and the commander of the Chantou soldiers' camp, had been widely rumored in Guannei that he had accompanied Nie Zier to the province to promote the change of governance, but this was not the case.

<h3>Luan County Militia Conflict Subsided</h3>
<p>Liu Zuo Zhou Incorporates the Militia</p>
<p>Gao Cong Shan Gathers a Crowd to Resist</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence The first general team of the Luan County garrison war zone security team clashed with the third district militia of Gao Congshan and Yin Zhisan in the county. As of the 19th, after Luan County chief Chen Cengshi, Lanyu administrative commissioner's office secretary Lin Zhiming, and local gentry tried their best to mediate, the dispute has subsided. The more than 1,000 security team members under Liu Zuozhou have been transferred back to the county seat, most of whom are still in the Bencheng area, taking a surveillance attitude towards the retreating militia. The militia retreated to the third district due to heavy casualties in the continuous fierce battles. The head of the regiment, Gao Congshan, and the deputy head of the regiment, Yin Zhisan, were captured by the security team, along with more than 100 village chiefs and deputies in the third district, all of whom were escorted into the city. The incident has come to an end. As for how to deal with the aftermath, the Ji Province government and county branch have issued orders, instructing the Lanyu administrative commissioner Tao Shangming and Luan County chief to handle it properly. Tao Shangming arrived in Tianjin by night train from Ping on the 19th, visited Yu Xuezhong early on the 20th, asked for instructions, and then took a car back to Tangshan to plan and proceed.</p>
<p>The cause of this conflict was that since last winter, Liu Zuozhou wanted to govern the entire territory of the Luan County militia without a provincial order, and reorganized the regiments into nine districts, appointing his cronies to serve as captains of each team, forcing local people to bear the military expenses and pay them on a monthly basis, which made the local people uneasy. The head of the third district militia, Gao Congsan, and the deputy head of the regiment, Yin Zhisan, secretly expanded their strength to resist. Recently, they had more than 1,000 people. On the 15th of this month, they broke through the siege and attacked the militia of Wang Ying, Le Ying, Ma Tun, and other five villages in the fourth district, confiscating their weapons. The team, which was reorganized by Liu Zuozhou, had more than 20 captains, all of whom were captured and transported to the third district in seven large carts. Passing through Bencheng, there were also hundreds of militia reorganized by Liu Zuozhou stationed there. Gao Yin also led the crowd to attack. They clashed with the local militia outside the north gate. Liu Zuozhou received the news and immediately sent a cavalry squadron to aid. A fierce battle broke out on the 16th. The militia had a larger number of people. After three hours of fierce battle, Liu's troops could not resist and dozens of them were killed. They then retreated. On the 17th, Liu Zuozhou personally led more than 1,000 troops to the scene of the conflict, supervising his troops to attack. That night, there was another fierce battle, with casualties on both sides. On the evening of the 18th, the conflict broke out again. The security team suppressed the militia with the power of artillery fire, causing the militia to suffer 60 or 70 deaths. The war stopped in the early morning of the 19th. Chen Cengjie, the magistrate of Luan County, Lin Zhiming, secretary of the Lanyu Administrative Inspectorate, and Councilor Zhu, and other gentry from Luan County went to Bencheng, trying their best to mediate. The militia handed over the weapons confiscated from the security team and the militia of Wang Ying and other five villages, and disbanded each team. Bencheng was guarded by the security team. Liu Zuozhou began to have no objection, so he led a unit back to the county. On the evening of the 19th, Chen, the magistrate of Luan County, hosted a banquet in the county government to entertain the gentry in the third district and the gentlemen who mediated the matter, inviting Liu Zuo, Lin Zhiming, and others to celebrate and release their suspicions. The dozen or so people, including Gao Congshan, Yin Zhisan, and the village chiefs and deputies who were arrested by the security team, were promised by Liu Zuozhou to be sent to the Lanyu Commissioner's Office for transfer to the court for handling. A storm was considered to have subsided. (20th)</p>
<h3>Taiwan's Rice Production Increases Six Hundred Times</h3>
<p>Japanese Cultivated Land is Converted to Industrial Products</p>
<p>Encouraging Rice Cultivation in Taiwan to Provide Relief</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence Taiwan has vigorously encouraged agricultural production by the Japanese in recent years, especially paying attention to rice and sugar. Rice is for the consumption of Japan, because the population of Japan is increasing day by day, and the cultivated land in the country is mostly converted to industrial agricultural products. Therefore, rice cultivation is particularly encouraged in Taiwan to make up for the lack of rice food in the country. Because Taiwan is located in the subtropics, the climate is mild, and the rainfall is suitable, two seasons of rice can be planted every year, the so-called early rice and late rice, which the Japanese call the first and second phases. According to the latest announcement by the Colonial Industry Bureau of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, the actual income of the first phase of rice last year (Showa 9) was 4,511,046 stones, and the actual income of the second phase was 4,577,480 stones. The total harvest for the rest of the year was 9,088,816 stones, which is the highest record since Taiwan existed. Compared with the actual income of 8,361,839 stones in the previous year, it increased by 727,047 stones. It was also found that the harvest of Penglai rice in the tenth year of the Taisho era (the tenth year of the Republic of China) was only 7,296 stones. Compared with the actual income of 4,286,280 stones last year, the actual increase in production was 600 times. Penglai rice is a kind of rice, that is, what the Japanese eat. (February 21)</p>
<h3>Ongoing Road and Water Conservancy Projects in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>—Zhangxia Railway also planned for construction—</p>
<p>Tongzhou Dispatch: After the recovery of the bandit areas in northwestern Fujian Province, road construction has been slow due to the lack of a unified command. The Department of Construction, recognizing this, has established the Zhanglongting Area Highway Engineering Office in Longyan to oversee road construction in northwestern Fujian. The entire line is divided into four sections, with construction undertaken by military engineering units. The first section, from Longyan to Liancheng, is built by the 83rd Division's suppression force; the second section, from Longyan to Yongding, is built by the 11th Division's Li Mo'an unit; the third section, from Liancheng to Yong'an, is undertaken by the 45th Division's Dai Minquan; and the fourth section, from Liancheng to Changting, is undertaken by the 36th Division's Song Xilian unit. The area highway office dispatches engineers to guide each section. Furthermore, banditry frequently occurs on the highways in northern and southern Fujian, with repeated incidents of vehicle robberies, which greatly impede traffic. The Department of Construction has received approval from the provincial government to organize six highway patrol teams, each with 200 members. Three teams are stationed on the roads in southern Fujian, and three teams are stationed on the roads in northern Fujian, specifically to protect vehicles. The monthly cost is 20,000 yuan, with the provincial government and the Ministry of Military Affairs each responsible for half. Meanwhile, the Provincial Highway General Engineering Office has established an engineering team, divided into bridge and culvert stone masonry groups, each with 200 people, specifically to repair and improve the roads in the rest of the province. The monthly cost is 12,000 yuan. Both teams are expected to be established within approximately three months. The Zhangxia Railway was suspended in 1932 due to mismanagement, and the Department of Construction sent personnel to manage it. Although overseas Chinese merchants from Southeast Asia proposed raising funds for construction, it did not materialize due to political changes. Now, the Department of Construction is planning to rebuild it, proposing to divide the entire line into two sections. The first section, from Xiamen to Zhangzhou, will be repaired and reopened first. The second section, from Zhangzhou to Changting, will be constructed depending on the circumstances. The provincial government has consulted the Ministry of Railways to send personnel to Fujian to jointly assess the remaining assets of the Zhangxia Railway to begin preparations.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding water conservancy, the provincial government has expanded the Committee for Dredging the Min River into the Provincial Water Conservancy General Engineering Office, under the jurisdiction of the Department of Construction, and appointed Yang Tingyu as its director. The plan is to first build a wharf at Majiang Luoxing Pagoda to accommodate seagoing vessels, with a budget of 200,000 yuan, which has been requested from the Central Bank. Furthermore, the Min River waterway, from Fuzhou to Yanping, is divided into three branches: one to Shunchang, one to Shaxian, and one to Jian'ou. The number of steamboats operating on the river is increasing daily, and competition is becoming increasingly fierce, causing extreme disorder in navigation. A Min River Transportation Office has been established to regulate all steamboats on the Min River. The office will determine the schedules, cabin assignments, and fares of all ships, and no arbitrary changes are allowed. The Department of Construction has appointed Guo Zeshou, the former president of the Bank of China in Fuzhou, as manager, and the office will open within days. Chen Ticheng, the head of the Department of Construction, recently traveled to Shanghai and then to Nanjing on the Taishun steamboat to negotiate with the National Economic Commission for the allocation of road construction funds, with the Ministry of Military Affairs for the organization of highway patrol teams, with the Ministry of Railways to discuss the construction of the Zhangxia Railway, and with the Ministry of Communications to report on the establishment of the Min River Transportation Office. He is expected to return to Fujian in about three weeks. (February 20)</p>
<h3>Lunan Taiwei Road Yi River Bridge Completed</h3>
<p>1,300 meters long</p>
<p>Construction cost of 180,000 yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Taiwei Motor Road, from Yixian Taierzhuang to Weixian, is the main line in southern Shandong and has the longest route. After the earthwork was completed, operations began, and the bridges and culverts were continuously constructed. A Bridge Engineering Office was established to divide the entire road into six major sections to supervise construction. The total construction cost is 800,000 yuan. Smaller culvert and bridge projects in each section have been completed in succession. However, the Yi River Bridge outside the east gate of Linyi in the second section is a large project, 1,300 meters long, and is a reinforced concrete overflow bridge. It is the largest bridge on the motor roads in the province. The construction cost is estimated at 180,000 yuan. The project was supervised by Liu Junzhe, the engineer of the road section, and Chen Yuncong and Men Xien, the engineers of the sub-sections. Construction began in October 1933 and lasted for one year and four months. It is now fully completed. After receiving the report, the Department of Construction dispatched Hu Xueji, a technician from the civil engineering group, to the site for acceptance inspection.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony for Changshan River</p>
<p>The Songjiang-Jinshan Counties' Changshan River Dredging Project Office held a groundbreaking ceremony yesterday in Lihui Town. The county government dispatched a water patrol team patrol boat to the West Market to pick up guests. The county chiefs of both counties were originally scheduled to attend the ceremony in person, but due to other official duties, they sent representatives instead. Those present included Xu Mojia and Zhang Jiliang, representatives of Songjiang County Chief Jin Tigan; Li Rui and Li Wenxue, representatives of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau; Jin Wenhuan, Feng Renlong, Chen Renyuan; Jin Hanfan, representative of Jinshan County Chief Tu Kaiyu; Qian Zhuoran, Huang Zhongbao; and guests from both counties Huang Jiutang, Zhang Mengxing, etc., as well as more than 20 contractor foremen such as Tang Mingjiang and Zhang Hongde.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Gentry from Liyang Come to Wuxi to Beg for Spring Relief</p>
<p>Since Liyang suffered a drought last year, misery is everywhere, and starvation is rampant. Yesterday, gentry from the county, Di Jianren, Di Xizhi, Shi Cantang, etc., came to Wuxi to solicit spring relief. They stayed at the New World Hotel and made initial contact with local philanthropists Tang Wenzhi, Tang Baoqian, Cai Jian-san, etc. According to Di, only about 10,000 mu of Liyang's million mu of farmland yielded a harvest. Large numbers of people have gone out to seek a living. Those who have not gone out cannot get enough to eat at home. Those who can fill their stomachs with bran and greens are considered to be doing well. Those below that only eat tree bark and grass roots. Therefore, the number of people starving to death each month is very large, and many cattle have also starved to death. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. They deeply hope for assistance from all sectors of society.</p>
<p>Qing-Dynasty Gift Jade Ruyi Stolen</p>
<p>Xue Fengjie, a deceased local gentry who once served as a magistrate during the late Qing Dynasty, whose mother was an adopted daughter of Empress Dowager Cixi, and who repeatedly entered the palace, had many treasures bestowed upon him by the emperor.

The home of An Wenkui (An serves at the Shanghai Shanghai Bank) in the village suddenly caught fire around 11 o'clock the night before last. Because it was late at night, no one knew about it, which led to it being uncontrollable. Only one fire-fighting water dragon arrived to put out the fire, resulting in the burning of more than 20 houses of five families, including An Hengbin and An Aduan, dozens of dan of white rice, and one large pig. Wenkui's eldest daughter, named Li Shang, who was only nine years old, did not escape and was tragically burned to death. The loss was quite significant.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Garrison Headquarters Officially Abolished</p>
<p>Hangzhou is the capital of Zhejiang Province, and the local security is important. In September 1933, the Provincial Capital Martial Law Headquarters was ordered to be abolished and replaced by the Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters to eliminate reactionaries, punish bandits, eliminate drugs, and maintain public order. After two years, Yu (Jishi), the commander, believed that the remnants of bandits in southeastern Jiangxi and southern Anhui had been eliminated, and local security was no longer a concern. The Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters was deemed unnecessary, and the Military Affairs Commission approved its official abolition, to be completed by the end of this month. Unfinished matters will be transferred to the Security Office for handling.</p>
<p>Two Car Accidents Result in Deaths</p>
<p>Car accidents in Hangzhou have been occurring frequently. Recently, there were two more incidents that resulted in deaths. (1) A Hugu Public Transport truck with license plate number 3013, driven by driver Cao Guohua, struck and killed a five-year-old child, Zheng Yu'er, near the Guandi Temple on Dongjie Road.

Yesterday at 11:00 a.m., local Xiehui President Du Yuesheng, Vice President Qian Xinzhi, Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting, Bank of China General Manager Zhang Gongquan, Banking Association Chairman Chen Guangfu, Qianye Gonghui Chairman Qin Runqing, and other leading figures, went to Minister Kong's residence on West Aiams Road to pay a visit to Mr. Kong, presented the two associations with a written statement, expressed the current market conditions and solutions, and requested the Central Bank to allocate large sums of money, directly lent to industry and commerce, to stabilize the market, and then slowly developed measures to restore the economy.</p>
<p>Minister Kong Promises to Do His Best to Maintain</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reporters, yesterday to explore the major industries, representatives of the local Xiehui and other organizations visited Minister Kong, requesting orders from the Central Bank to allocate large sums of money, directly lent to industry and commerce, is to point to merchandise property and other mortgage loans.

<p>Loan Contraction Avoids Repeating Mistakes</p>
<p>The banking and currency industries, after the 1934 general disaster relief, have contracted all types of loans, especially credit loans, and the industrial and commercial sectors have been quite vocal against them, but according to reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency, this is actually a misunderstanding, because although the banking and currency industries were fortunate to make a profit last year, they inevitably suffered bad debts. For example, banks such as Tongyi Jiande and huahua banks such as Baodayudechang were unable to turnover and closed down. The market this year is still depressed, especially more so than last year. Now, for their own sake, they have contracted all types of loans to avoid repeating their mistakes. This is inevitable.</p>
<p>Three Reasons for Market Downturn</p>
<p>The reasons for the market downturn are roughly: (1) affected by the overall global economic recession; (2) the decline of China's rural areas and lack of purchasing power; (3) since the US government nationalized silver, a large amount of silver flowed out of China. Although the government has set up a foreign exchange stabilization committee, increased the silver export tax and balance tax, encouraged foreign silver imports in the future, and tried to revive the countryside and support the development of industry and commerce, it is difficult to recover in a short time due to the excessive damage.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Organizes Specialized Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce held an executive supervisory meeting yesterday at 4:00 p.m., with more than 30 people attending, including Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, Wang Yansong, Yu Zuoting, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilong, Jin Runxiang, Fang Jiaobo, Ke Ganchen, Shen Tianxin, Luo Qinghua, Chen Xiaodie, etc. Yu Zuoting presided over the meeting and reported on the main purpose of the meeting, and then read out letters from 15 trade associations, and then began to discuss the plan to help the market. Yu Qiaqing, Chen Xiaodie, Jin Runxiang, Wang Yansong, Xu Jilong, etc. all expressed their opinions. After research, it was determined that specific measures must be carefully planned, and it was decided to organize a specialized committee based on this discussion, and Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilong, and others were immediately appointed as specialized committee members. It is said that the committee meeting will be convened soon.</p>
<h3>Banking Association Notifies Members of Outer Bund Forward Spread</h3>
<p>At Most One Two Five Gold Market Points Per Day</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association yesterday notified the member banks that the Foreign Banks Association has resolved that the forward spread of transactions on the Bund will be at most 125 gold market points per month, or 1/8 (other currencies are calculated accordingly). It is said that foreign banks have already implemented this. It is found that Chinese banks that also operate foreign exchange transactions do not have many forward transactions, so they can do the same. This is to notify the banks in the association, and it is hoped that they will check and comply.</p>
<h3>Qianye Association Holds Memorial Service for Former Directors</h3>
<p>Held Yesterday at the Beishi Guild Hall</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Shanghai Qianye Industry Association held an annual meeting yesterday at the Qianye Guild Hall at the intersection of North Henan Road and Wenjianshi Road, in accordance with the annual practice. All members of the association, such as Fuyuan, Fukang, Dade, Tongtai, Zhiyu, Yida, Hengxun, Zhicheng, Hefeng, Henglong, Tongqing, Zhentai, Yida, Shenyuan, Baofeng, Hongsheng, etc., all participated. Chairman Qin Runqing led the public memorial service for the former directors, followed by a report on the budget settlement of the Beishi Guild Hall, and lunch at the guild hall. The meeting decided to hold quarterly meetings of the managers of the member Qianye associations, convened by the Qianye Industry Association, to discuss how to improve and develop the business. Yesterday was the day of the spring meeting, and it was also held at the annual meeting, chaired by Qin Runqing. The managers of each bank exchanged opinions on improving the business. Because it was the first time, there were no decisions made. All banks were aware of the market downturn after the listing and the turnover problems of the industry when closing accounts. For the sake of prudence, all types of loans will be contracted this year to avoid repeating the mistakes.</p>

<p>Certificate Should Be Obtained from the Ministry</p>
<p>In order to promote domestic products, the Ministry of Industry has re-stipulated the tax exemption and fee reduction measures for domestic product exhibits. It was reported to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday. According to the case, the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to promote domestic products, urged provinces and cities to hold exhibitions and display halls, and go to overseas competitions to encourage production.

When holding exhibitions in various places and soliciting products or soliciting exhibits, the competent authorities in each place would submit the matter for record and issue them for use. Now, the certificates and shipping orders are about to be used up, and the relevant departments have been consulted to reprint them.

However, the exemption of export tax and import tax does not apply to this certificate. However, for products sold or transferred to other places at the exhibition site, those with a value of more than 50 yuan must still be taxed in accordance with regulations. In addition, when filling out railway fee reduction orders, national railways should charge 50% of the current ordinary freight rate for exhibits, and 75% for sold products, in accordance with the quantity of exhibits stipulated in the regulations for soliciting products. When filling out steamer fee reduction orders, all routes under the China Merchants Bureau should charge 50% of the current ordinary freight rate.

<h3>浙省推廣植棉計劃</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province Promotes Cotton Planting Plan</p>
<p>Wang Yingbin and Feng Zhaochuan Travel to Nanjing and Shanghai to Negotiate</p>
<p>Wang Yingbin, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, recently also served as Director of the Cotton Industry Management Office. The other day, he and Feng Zhaochuan, Deputy Director of the office and Director of the Cotton Field, came to Shanghai from Hangzhou to discuss the purchase of cotton seeds with Chen Guangfu, Zou Bingwen, Deng Fupei, and others from the National Cotton Industry Control Association. According to Mr. Wang, Zhejiang Province's construction undertakings in recent years have been organized on a considerable scale in terms of transportation. Regarding agriculture, it is striving to promote, so it has specially organized an Agricultural Management Committee, which hopes to pay special attention to the cotton industry, so it has also organized a Cotton Industry Management Office. Last year, 20,000 mu of American cotton were trial-planted throughout Zhejiang. This year, it is planned to expand to 150,000 mu. The expansion plan must increase the work by seven times compared to the 20,000 mu work. It is intended that the work will be tense in the future, so it is specially here to consult with the National Cotton Industry Statistics Association. Chen, Zou, Deng, and others from the association all unanimously agreed and tried their best to help, because the results of Zhejiang Province's cotton industry last year were good, and this year it has increased and expanded, and the future results will definitely be predictable. Wang and Feng plan to go to Nanjing by train on the evening of the 24th (Sunday) to request the Ministry of Railways to give special fee reductions when transporting cotton seeds in the future, and immediately go to Zhengzhou to purchase cotton seed work, and also investigate cotton industry experience along the way, preparing for future reference for the expansion and improvement of cotton industry plans. It is believed that the two will make many contributions to the future of Zhejiang Province's cotton industry after returning from Henan this time. According to the investigation, before 1934, the cotton fields for promoting improvement in Zhejiang Province totaled 3,900 mu. After the trial, it was quite effective, so in 1934, it was promoted from 3,900 mu to more than 16,000 mu. The best results were in the coastal American cotton area. Cixi County had an average yield of 189 jin per mu, and even ordinary ones reached more than 150 jin. The general farmers, because they have made considerable profits, have all applied to expand the cotton area. In 1934, the cotton fields for promotion and improvement in Xiaoshan, Hangzhou County, Yuyao, Zhenhai, Cixi, Pinghu, Yinxian, and other counties reached a total of more than 16,730 mu. The total number of harvested seed cotton was 14,890 dan, and the ginned net flower had 4,039 dan. This year, due to disaster relief and the implementation of work relief, it is planned to promote and improve 150,000 mu of cotton fields. In the cotton areas along the Yangtze River, such as Hangzhou County, Xiaoshan, and other counties, 75,000 mu of Million Chinese cotton will be promoted. In the coastal cotton areas, such as Yuyao, Cixi, Zhenhai, and other counties, 65,000 mu of domesticated American cotton will be promoted. In addition, 10,000 mu of Million Chinese cotton and domesticated American cotton will be developed and planted in Shili荒山 and other places in Qu County, inland Zhejiang East, totaling 150,000 mu of promotion. As for the various cotton seeds required for various promotion and improvement plans, they will be selected and purchased by the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Construction Department and distributed to various cotton farmers for collection. Regarding the technical matters of sowing, fertilizing, cultivating, weeding, and harvesting, the office will also specially set up more than 60 instructors at all levels to go to various counties for practical guidance. The harvest results are expected to produce 135,000 dan of cotton in the future, assuming 90 jin per mu. Taking 12 yuan per dan as the price, the total cost is 1.62 million yuan, which is not only higher than that of native cotton, but the proceeds can also be increased by two-tenths. Flower collection, ginning, and transportation, this cotton is all fine velvet cotton, which is suitable for spinning fine yarn of more than 20 counts. It is certain that it will sell well in the future. Moreover, in order to prevent cotton merchants from suppressing prices and retaining seeds (for expanded promotion next year), all matters related to flower collection, ginning, and transportation are handled by the flower collection and ginning factories specially set up by the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Construction Department. Those who do not set up special factories also organize cotton transportation and sales cooperatives to handle it. However, since the flower collection, ginning, and other businesses are complex and require a lot of money, the office also plans to organize a special committee for cotton production management to engage in design and implementation, and work together. It is estimated that 500,000 mu of cotton fields can be promoted next year.</p>
<h3>上海國貨公司實施科學管理演講會</h3>
<p>Shanghai National Goods Company Holds Lecture on Implementing Scientific Management</p>
<p>Reduced Price Department for Inventory to Be Held Starting Today</p>
<p>Shanghai National Goods Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, after entrusting the China Statistical Design Society to plan scientific management, has drawn up drawings of various departments and determined the cost accounting of each department, and announced that it will be implemented from March 1st. Last night, in order to make all employees understand the value and significance of scientific management, the company convened all employees to hold a lecture. Mr. Ren Jinpin, supervisor of the company, was the main speaker. The topic was "Why Use Scientific Management?" The main idea was that today's China has three major problems: first, there is no policy for governing the country; second, there is no plan for managing business; and third, there is no method for being a person. The so-called no policy, no plan, and no method all mean letting nature take its course. Letting nature take its course is a kind of action that does not conform to scientific meaning, and can also be said to be an action without a complete purpose. Actions that do not conform to scientific meaning or have no definite purpose often fail to advance the undertaking, or if they can advance the undertaking, their progress is often very slow, or only an occasional progress, not a necessary progress, or even only see progress, but do not know the reason for the progress. If scientific management is implemented, the actions of those who govern the undertaking can become planned actions, and their actions can reach a certain purpose in accordance with the plan, and the actors can know whether their actions have obtained value and whether they have done their best and whether there are ways to increase their efforts. For example, the monthly expenditure of a certain department of the company is 300 yuan, and the profit from business income is calculated at 10%, then the monthly business must be 3,000 yuan, that is, 100 yuan of business per day, otherwise it means that the manager has failed to do his best, or the manager has indeed done his best, but there is no way to increase his business, then this department should be replaced. The so-called scientific management is not a mysterious method, but it is to make manpower, time, and material resources not be wasted without value, and if there is a waste, it must make a profit. Therefore, the business rise and fall table of each department issued by the company in the future has a red line drawn in the table. The red line is the standard line for the staff of each department to observe whether they have done their best and fulfilled their responsibilities. If the business line drawn every day cannot exceed the red line, it is a phenomenon of business loss. If each department has this phenomenon, it should immediately study the cause of this phenomenon and find ways to eliminate this cause. This is the meaning of knowing its failure, studying the cause, and seeking success. Therefore, scientific management is not a mysterious method, but it is used to encourage people to do their best and strive for success in their careers. Now, the company will hold a large-scale price reduction of inventory from today to clear the inventory and replenish new goods in preparation for the implementation of scientific management.</p>

<h3>浙省捐税監理會今日常會</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee Holds Regular Meeting Today</p>
<p>Zhang Shouyong and Chu Fucheng Travel to Attend</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee was established last month. The association is located at No. 40 Zhen Dong Lou in the provincial capital. According to the rules of procedure, the fourth Saturday of each month is the date of the regular meeting. The regular meeting was held at 3:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. Zhang Taoyong and Chu Fucheng, two members of the Shanghai delegation, traveled to attend today. It is learned that Mr. Chu Fucheng has a proposal, which is recorded as follows: "Proposal on the Reduction and Exemption of Surcharges and Exactions on Rural Field Taxes" (1) Reasons: The decline of rural areas in recent years is mostly due to heavy taxes and fees. The field taxes in western Zhejiang are already the heaviest in the country, and the surcharges are increasing. For each mu, the total of the regular and surcharges is more than double the regular tax in eastern Zhejiang. Recently, new names have been cleverly created to increase the mu tax and grain tax, and the people are even more distressed. If we want to revive the rural areas in this way, it is no different from pressing people with huge stones and asking children to help them stand up. How can we get it? Since the central government clearly ordered the reduction of field tax surcharges and the abolition of exactions and miscellaneous taxes last year, although this province has abolished 457 kinds of exactions and miscellaneous taxes, totaling 247,511 national currencies, and reduced field tax surcharges, excluding those that have expired, totaling 803,241 national currencies, it is still not enough to relieve the people's difficulties. If we do not reform from a large perspective, there is no hope for rural revival. The representatives of the committee deeply know that the county's finances are extremely difficult, and the undertakings cannot be abandoned. It is not appropriate to suddenly reduce income. However, the people are the foundation of the country, "If the people are not enough, who is enough?" The ancient teachings are clear. If the farmers have no ability to bear the burden, they will not be reduced. The trend of owing taxes will become more prevalent, and the government's income will still decrease. It is better to quickly set a phased reduction plan and slowly raise compensation. As for the exactions and taxes that have not been abolished, according to the representative's knowledge, there are still several aspects that have a considerable impact on the rural areas. Now, we will select the important ones from the surcharges and exactions on field taxes and propose separate reduction and exemption methods. In accordance with Article 3 of the rules of procedure of this meeting, the proposal is presented to see if it is appropriate. Please decide publicly. (2) Methods: (A) It should be requested that the provincial government stipulate two things for phased reduction: 1. Construction special donation for field tax surcharges, that is, compensation gold, an additional one yuan for each stone, and an additional one yuan for each tael of land tax, which will be reduced by two corners each year from 1935 until they are all exempted in 1939. (Explanation) The construction special donation is the heaviest of the field tax surcharges. This surcharge originated from the military special donation, which was limited to one year of collection. At that time, the people supported the national revolution and paid it with pain. When it expired, it was changed to a construction special donation and continued to be collected, which is already illegal. Moreover, since the construction surcharge has been collected, the construction special donation has been collected again, which is obviously a double tax. It should be stopped immediately. However, considering that this income has been used to offset the construction public bond fund, which is a large amount, it is difficult to raise compensation for a while, so it is set to be reduced in five years. 2. The mu donation of the security regiment should be reduced by one-third from 1935 until it is all exempted in 1937. (Explanation) The counties often set up security regiments because they have no funds and collect mu donations along with the grain. The donation rate collected is several corners to three yuan for each yuan of regular tax, which can be said to be the most severe extortion. The Department of Finance has proposed to stop collecting it. Now the borders of the province have been cleared of bandits, and the security team can be transferred back to the counties for stationing. The number of security regiments can be greatly reduced. Moreover, the counties will have remarkable achievements in training the militia by next year, and there is no need for this conscription-style security regiment, which is a waste of public funds. Therefore, it is proposed to completely stop this expense in the year after next. (B) Three things should be requested to be abolished by the provincial government immediately: 1. Eternal tenancy contract tax. (Explanation) Tenant farmers are the poorest. It is unreasonable to ask them to bear taxes. Moreover, since its establishment, it has achieved nothing. The provincial government bears the bad name of exploiting poor farmers in vain, and it actually does not help finance. It is better to abolish it quickly. 2. Business tax collected by tooth banks. (Explanation) The tooth banks in various places in the province pay the post donation. Most of the people who sell goods at the banks are farmers, and they are responsible for collecting business tax on their own products, which is equivalent to collecting tax on farmers' local products. It is not legal and causes disturbances. The Ministry of Finance's document No. 7892 has expressed it generously. It should be stopped immediately. 3. License donation for civil ships with a load of less than 100 dan. (Explanation) Shipowners mostly belong to the working class and should not be taxed. Moreover, farmers who own ships are only for loading tools and selling agricultural products. It is not a business nature at all, and they should not be forced to pay donations. However, the ship offices in various places often regard agricultural ships carrying agricultural products as business and force them to pay license donations, which often cause disputes. The provincial government should amend the ship license donation regulations to allow civil ships with a load of less than 100 dan to be exempted.</p>
<h3>薔薇園新村擴充徵求</h3>
<p>Rose Garden New Village Expands Solicitation</p>
<p>Four Banks Savings Association and Guohua Bank Act as Liaison</p>
<p>Those from All Walks of Life Who Order Housing Can Visit Nearby</p>
<p>China, or the Rose Garden New Village, the founder of the new village construction, advocates the realization of a regularized, industrialized, and artistic life. Its method is to gather outstanding members of society in one village to cooperate in establishing a new life. If it can follow this goal, it is indeed a new route for a new village movement. According to Mr. Ren Lianchang, director of the business department of the company, who talked about the recent progress of the business yesterday, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Residential Grade</p>
<p>The style and structure of the various grades of houses in the village are carefully designed by professional talents. In order to meet different needs, they are divided into five grades: A, B, C, D, and E. The forms and sizes are different, but the completeness of the equipment and the solidity of the project are the same. In addition, each grade of housing has several styles, and residents can choose a satisfactory base to build applicable housing.</p>
<p>Payment Method</p>
<p>The company is purely for social service and hopes that the benefits of the new village can be popularized to the society. Therefore, the selling price of the village's industry is based on cost and no commercial attempt is made. The ordering procedures are extremely simple, and the payment methods are designed to suit the economic capabilities of the general public. They can pay in one lump sum, or they can pay in installments based on the principle of savings and investment. Upon expiration, they will obtain ownership of the real estate.</p>
<p>Business Situation</p>
<p>The general public believes that the village's superior environment, economical and comfortable design, low production price, and simple ordering procedures are the only way to solve the problem of urban residence. Therefore, those who order housing at the company at No. 918 Aiguo Road are very enthusiastic. The first step of the village's plan, the A, B, and C grades of housing, have already been fulfilled and have already started construction. The second step of the plan, the D and E grades of housing, have also been set for two-thirds. In the autumn of social depression, the company's business can still progress step by step, which shows that the problem of urban residence is serious.</p>
<h3>外觀進行建築中之薔薇園新村</h3>
<p>Exterior View of the Rose Garden New Village Under Construction</p>
<p>Increase the Number</p>
<p>The company believes that there are not many houses left, and the social demand should not be limited to this. It has specially opened up a piece of land originally intended for planting into residential land to increase the number of houses. The total number of houses left is 32, including 3 A-grade houses, 5 B-grade houses, 18 D-grade houses, and 6 F-grade houses. In order to avoid affecting the completion date of the new village, the company will intensify the solicitation work from today, aiming to collect enough new village residents in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Liaison Location</p>
<p>In order to facilitate ordering by all walks of life, the company has specially set up residential ordering liaison offices at the Sichuan Road Four Banks Savings Association General Assembly, Jing'an Temple Road North Sichuan Road Xiafei Road Branches, Beijing Road Guohua Bank General Bank, and Haige Road Xinzha Road Ba仙橋 North Sichuan Road Xiaodongmen Branches. There are more than ten liaison locations distributed throughout the city. Those from all walks of life who join the new village can contact nearby. All places have charts and printed materials for your reference.</p>

The next morning, he, along with two prostitutes, the second and third girls from the Yinghong brothel in Xinhui Music Lane, whom he was intimate with, boarded the President Coolidge and fled Shanghai for Hong Kong. The bank discovered this and urgently telegraphed the Hong Kong police authorities to intercept them. The bank also dispatched personnel, along with police officers from this city, to Hong Kong to pursue and arrest him. Hua has now been apprehended and was escorted back to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 17th. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, he arrived on the Ewo Wheel. The trial of Hua and the two prostitutes will be held in court today. Hua has lost both wealth and women, truly a vain dream of beauty and gold. The details obtained from various sources are recorded below:</p>
<p>Stealing Money and Taking Women, Planning to Live as a Gentleman of Leisure</p>
<p>Hua Zhongchu had been an employee of the bank for only a year. Hua was still young and often indulged in prostitution, becoming intimate with the second and third girls from the Yinghong brothel in Xinhui Music Lane. After a long time, his money ran out, and he could think of no solution. So, on the evening of the 12th, he stole a large sum of over 40,000 yuan. On the 13th, he purchased tickets from the Great American Company and boarded the Coolidge, leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong. The cabin he occupied was number 138. Hua's attire upon departure was very simple, with only a small leather suitcase containing over 26,000 silver dollars. He planned to kill two birds with one stone, taking the two women to Hong Kong to live as a gentleman of leisure.</p>
<p>The Oriole Was Behind, Gaining Without Labor</p>
<p>The China Agricultural and Industrial Bank discovered the theft on the morning of the 13th and immediately began an investigation, finally uncovering the truth. They urgently reported it to the police and also inquired with the Great American Company, learning the cabin number Hua occupied. Immediately, the Central Police Station telegraphed the Hong Kong Police Station, requesting them to intercept Hua upon the arrival of the Great American Wheel. At that time, Hua Zhongchu was beaming with joy, planning to transfer to a small boat to reach the city and find a residence when the wheel docked in the center of the river, thinking that since the mountains were high and the emperor was far away, he could live freely beyond the law. Little did he know that the Hong Kong Police Station had already dispatched a small boat to wait at the port's river center. When the arriving wheel docked, they rushed into cabin number 138 and indeed found one man and two women. They immediately apprehended them without labor, which was at 4:00 PM on the 15th.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Bank Dispatched Personnel to Guangzhou for Extradition</p>
<p>After discovering the theft on the 13th of this month, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank immediately completed the investigation procedures with the city police. On the 15th at 7:00 AM, An Jianxun from the bank's general affairs department, accompanied by Zhang Minde, the chief detective of the Central Police Station, and Cai Liu, a detective from the Police Department, took a China Airlines flight to Guangzhou. They arrived at 3:30 PM and then took a train to Kowloon, and then to Hong Kong, by 8:00 PM. The Hong Kong police had already arrested Hua Zhongchu and the two prostitutes and were immediately escorting them back to Shanghai. They departed on the Ewo Wheel of Jardine Matheson, which was originally scheduled to arrive the day before, but was delayed due to fog at sea, arriving only at 7:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>The Lover Regrets, the Beauty Withers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, when Hua and the two prostitutes were being escorted off the wheel, many people watched. Hua was a handsome young man, dressed in a dark Western suit, overcoat, and leather shoes, resembling a worldly gentleman. The second and third beautiful prostitutes were only twenty-nine years old, fashionably dressed, and gracefully slender. One wore a coat over a black velvet cheongsam, and the other wore a yellow short coat, high-heeled leather shoes, and carried a dancing clutch. Those who didn't know would think they were daughters of a wealthy family, unaware that they were about to become prisoners. Currently, this man and two women have been detained in the police station and will be jointly escorted to the First Special District Court of the city this morning, along with the three suspects involved in the case, for strict legal proceedings. As for the stolen silver dollars, 26,000 yuan has already been found in Hong Kong. Detective Zhang and others felt it was inconvenient to carry, so they requested the Hong Kong Police Department to telegraphically remit the funds to Shanghai, which should arrive within days. The whereabouts of the remaining ten thousand yuan are currently unknown and are being investigated.</p>

<h3>The Changshu Ferry Boat "Xie Mao" Was Robbed</h3>
<p>Reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Requesting Strict Apprehension by Subordinates</p>
<p>The details of the robbery of the Shanghai inner river ferry boat "Xie Mao" on its return trip from Shanghai to Changshu are as follows:</p>
<p>The "Pingjiang" Wheel Encountered Robbers First</p>
<p>The "Pingjiang" small steamship of the Shanghai Gongmao Steamship Bureau, on the 28th of last month, departed from Shanghai for Changshu. While traveling near Zhangjiajing, it encountered a pirate ship that fired shots to stop the "Pingjiang" wheel from proceeding. When the "Pingjiang" wheel stopped, the pirates boarded the ship and robbed it. No passenger on the entire ship was spared, with a total of over 300 silver dollars being robbed, along with a significant amount of clothing. Although the local government and military police were notified, no arrests have been made to this day. Before one case was solved, another occurred.</p>
<p>The "Xie Mao" Wheel Was Also Robbed</p>
<p>The "Xie Mao" wheel of the Xiexing Wheel Bureau, which operates a regular route between Shanghai and Changshu, departed from Shanghai this time at 4:00 PM on the 16th, towing ships from Tongyun and Taian companies, carrying many passengers. At around 11:00 PM that night, when the ship reached the Panlonggang area of Jiading County, a roofless pirate ship suddenly approached. Each pirate wielded a handgun, jumping out of the ship and first ordering the wheel to stop. Seeing the firearms, the "Xie Mao" wheel immediately stopped, and the pirates surged aboard, robbing and looting at will.</p>
<p>There Were Over Ten Pirates</p>
<p>There were over ten bandits who boarded the ship, all speaking in mixed accents. Some wore mud hats and long gowns, while others wore Zhongshan suits. After boarding, they used their guns to prevent the crew and passengers from making any noise or unauthorized movements. Then, the pirates robbed each passenger on the entire ship one by one. Passengers inside the small wheel and on the company ships were not spared. It was said that the pirates focused on money during the robbery. They entered the ship at around 11:00 PM and left with their loot at around 12:00 PM, lasting over an hour. The pirates then boarded their original ship and fled.</p>
<p>Amount of Losses from the Robbery</p>
<p>Most of the robbery victims were passengers. A passenger named Zhang Yang and his maid were robbed of over 170 yuan in banknotes and a Fang wristwatch. Another male passenger, Guan Aoao, was robbed of 100 silver dollars. There were countless others who lost three, four, or ten yuan. The losses to the ship's office were minimal. Among the cargo, only one can of bamboo shoots was robbed. Because it was late at night and far from the police station, they had no choice but to listen to their demands and dared not resist.</p>
<p>Reporting the Robbery in Shanghai and Requesting Strict Apprehension</p>
<p>After the pirates left, the wheel inspected the losses and immediately sailed back to Shanghai instead of proceeding to Changshu. After the "Xie Mao" wheel arrived in Shanghai, the captain reported it to the Xiexing Company yesterday. At the same time, we requested the trade association to report the details of the incident to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, ordering strict pursuit and arrest of the bandits. We also requested the inner river water police to implement ship escorts to ensure the safety of inner river navigation and to protect the lives and property of passengers.</p>
<h3>The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society Regularly Shows Educational Films</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society is established to improve the lives of rickshaw pullers and promote social harmony. This kind of undertaking is still a pioneering effort in the country. We hope that all circles will give it care so that we can fulfill our expectations. The society has already realized more than ten kinds of work, such as rickshaw pullers' children's schools, rickshaw pullers' day and night schools, dormitories, clinics, and rain shelters. The achievements are remarkable. We have printed a report on the work overview. If you want to read it, send a letter to the general association at Dongjiaxing Road with two cents of postage, and it will be sent to you. Recently, we feel that it is necessary for ordinary hard-working rickshaw pullers to regulate their spirits, so we have specially installed a moving sound film machine. We stipulate that one or two times a week, we will select and show various educational and health films so that the audience can feel interested and at the same time get a useful reference. It is said that at 7:00 PM this Sunday evening, the association will hold a regular health moving film, such as the prevention of tuberculosis and trachoma, and scenic films about entertainment. The association's doctor, Jin Fusu, will also give a lecture. This move is really a necessary work to promote civic common sense and guide the masses to enter the track, which is of great benefit to society. It is said that in the past, when film lectures were held, there was always a feeling of too few seats and too many people.</p>
<h3>Record of the Arrest and Trial of Hua Tailor, a Wanted Murder Suspect</h3>
<p>Hua Tailor, a native of Anhui, whose given name is Yansan, is 27 years old and works as a tailor. He used to live at No. 3 Pu'ai Fang, Zhoujiazui Road, next to Qin Maobiao, a fellow villager at No. 12, who is 29 years old. They have always been good friends. Recently, due to a money dispute, they quarreled with each other between the fourth day of the first lunar month, and then fought and dispersed. Hua Tailor then went to Minhang to stay and did not return home. At about 9:00 PM on the 14th of this month, Hua came to Shanghai to visit a friend. He happened to meet Qin on Ningwu Road, and they quarreled again. As a result of the fight, the two rolled into the nearby river. Hua managed to climb ashore, his clothes and pants all wet. He ran to Cao Fushou, a fellow villager on the road not far away, and borrowed clothes to change into. He hired a boat back to Minhang overnight. Qin, however, suffered serious injuries and swallowed a lot of water. He barely managed to get up and walked a few steps before collapsing to the ground, lying on his back. He was found by patrolman No. 2624, who sent him to the hospital, where he died. The body was taken to the corpse examination office on Feilun Road. The prosecutor sent by the First Special District Court confirmed that the death was caused by injury. The body was handed over to his wife, Qin Jiangshi, for burial. Recently, Huapu No. 1821 talked about this matter with a friend surnamed Kuai and learned about the location of Hua Tailor's hiding place. He reported it to the Yangshupu Police Station, which sent Huatan Zhang Yunjian to Minhang secretly the day before yesterday. Together with the local security team members, they arrested him, brought him back to the police station, and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the previous situation in detail. Then, according to Qin Jiangshi, the wife of the deceased, the defendant had borrowed three yuan from her husband, but he had not been able to get it back, which caused the disaster. According to Cao Fushou, they quarreled and fought at that place because of the money. Yu and a local named Yang separated them, but then they continued to fight. I don't know when the defendant came to my place, saying that he was pushed into the river by Qin, his clothes were soaked, and he borrowed clothes to change into and left. It was not until the next morning that he learned that Qin had died of his injuries. He presented the clothes that the defendant had changed into for inspection and requested their return. When asked, the defendant confessed that on the first month, the deceased had colluded with Cao Laowu and others to forcibly demand three yuan from him, slapped him in the face, and his friend surnamed Qin punched him twice. He did not borrow money from him, so he went to Minhang temporarily. At that time, he fell into the water in Ningwu Road during the fight, but he did not expect that he would die. The rest of his confession was evasive, asking for forgiveness. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be detained and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<h3>Li Jiaxiang Was Sued by His Father's Concubine</h3>
<p>Requesting Alimony</p>
<p>Li Jiaxiang, a native of Hefei, Anhui, who lives at No. 7 Ruizhili, Maitehesituo Road, is a descendant of Li Hongzhang, the late Qing Dynasty Prime Minister. He owns real estate worth no less than five million in this city and Wuhu. Jiaxiang's father, Li Jingju, also passed away. However, during his lifetime, he took a woman from Yangzhou, Chen, as a concubine in Wuhu during the 32nd year of the Guangxu period. The following year, the woman gave birth to a daughter and lived in an outer room and never entered the Li family's door. Now, she is living in Shanghai, is over forty years old, and is in dire straits. She has repeatedly requested alimony from Jiaxiang, but all have been rejected. Chen recently hired lawyer Zhao Shiji to file a lawsuit against Li Jiaxiang, claiming that she is now forty-four years old and requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay her alimony of sixty yuan per month until she is sixty years old, totaling 11,880 yuan, and that the defendant pay it off at once to maintain her life. The First Special District Court has summoned the defendant for trial. Since the defendant did not appear, it was postponed until yesterday afternoon for another hearing. The defendant was still absent. Judge Qiao briefly questioned the plaintiff Li Chen and ordered another adjournment, waiting for the defendant to be summoned to the case for review.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Judgement in the Case of Longhua Temple Monk Yuan Zhao Stealing and Selling Temple Property</h3>
<p>Yuan Zhao's Testimony Was Vague; Yan Wanglong Was Ordered to Be Detained</p>
<p>After Abbot Xingkong of Longhua Temple took over management of the temple last year, he discovered that the temple's property had been almost entirely stolen and sold by the previous abbot, Yuan Zhao. Yuan Zhao had also colluded with Hu Su Ji to privately create a false contract for seventy-six market houses in front of the temple, falsely claiming to have borrowed tens of thousands of yuan from Hu Su Ji previously and being unable to repay it. Therefore, these houses were to be used as Hu Su Ji's rented land for building houses, with no interest on the money and no rent on the houses. The contract stipulated that the houses would be unconditionally returned to Longhua Temple as official property in the 42nd year of the Republic. Xingkong then filed a lawsuit in the civil division of the local court, requesting confirmation that the contract was invalid. The court ruled that the contract was indeed invalid. Yuan Zhao, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, which upheld the original judgment after the trial. Xingkong then filed a criminal complaint with the local court, accusing Yuan Zhao of embezzling temple property. Meanwhile, Monk Minfeng of Hongshan Temple also filed a complaint against Yuan Zhao, accusing him of dismantling Hongshan Temple without authorization, rebuilding it into market houses for rental income, and moving all the Buddhist statues to a corner of Longhua Temple for storage. He demanded the restoration of Hongshan Temple, the return of the Buddhist statues, and their normal worship, etc. Yuan Zhao was arrested by order and interrogated by Prosecutor Li Fen, who found the evidence clear and filed a lawsuit in the criminal court. After several trials, the case remained unresolved. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. The society has paid considerable attention to this case. Because the situation is complicated, and because key witness Yan Wanglong (Yuan Zhao's nephew-in-law) has repeatedly failed to appear despite being summoned, the case has remained unresolved. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, Judge Shao Qinzhi specially opened the Third Court for further trial. Yan Wanglong finally appeared at this time. Xingkong was represented by lawyer Pan Zhensheng in court, and Minfeng and lawyer Lu Qi arrived successively. First, there was</p>
<p>Yan Wanglong's Testimony</p>
<p>Thirty-five years old, from Ninghai, residing at No. 2, Fu'an Lane, Baiyang Lane, South Gate. Used to run a store. (Question) What is your relationship with Yuan Zhao? (Answer) No relationship, just acquainted. (Question) The official asked: Monk Minfeng said you are Yuan Zhao's nephew. (Yan Answer) No. (Question) What is the situation of the Hongshan Temple foundation? (Answer) It's my family's. The land was lent to Hongshan Temple to build the temple. (Question) What proof do you have? (Answer) None. Since the expiration of the lease in the 16th year of the Republic, my family has taken back the land. Now the property deed has been renewed twice. (Question) Is there a senior contract? (Answer) No. (Question) In whose name is it registered? (Answer) Ling Guyu. (Official) said: It is clear that this land does not belong to your family. (Answer) It is my maternal grandmother's property. Ling Guyu is my maternal grandmother's husband, who gifted it to my family. (Question) In the 16th year of the Republic, was Yuan Zhao the abbot of Hongshan Temple? (Answer) Yes. (Question) According to you, the land was taken back in the 16th year. Do you have any evidence? (Answer) No. (Question) How many houses have been built now? (Answer) Twenty-four buildings, twelve storefronts, monthly rent of thirty-two yuan. Twelve residences, monthly rent of twenty-eight yuan. (Question) Do you collect the rent? (Answer) Yes. The official ordered him to submit the property deed to the court. Yan (Answer) One is still here, and the other is mortgaged to Xinhua Bank for five thousand yuan. The official said: You should submit the property deed to the court immediately, otherwise you will be detained. Yan listened to the order and immediately looked back at his friends in the audience, asking them to bring it quickly. At this point in the interrogation, lawyer Lu Qi stood up and stated that Minfeng had now filed a private prosecution against Yan Wanglong in the criminal court, and Yan had repeatedly failed to appear despite being summoned.</p>
<p>Request for Detention</p>
<p>to prevent the risk of escape. The interrogating official ordered Minfeng to testify, stating that the land and houses of Hongshan Temple were donated by the old monk Guangjian. He requested the restoration of Hongshan Temple, the return of the Buddhist statues, and their normal worship. (Official) said: You currently reside in the Sun Temple. You monks make your home everywhere. Why must you insist on Hongshan Temple? (Answer) This temple is the result of the old monk's hard work. Now that it has been demolished by Yuan Zhao, and all the Buddhas have been scattered, my heart cannot bear it. Finally, Yuan Zhao testified that Hongshan Temple was completed around the Tongzhi period. The land price was extremely cheap at the time, so there was no formal procedure when renting the land to build the temple. (Official) said: That's right. Now that land prices have risen, such things have begun to happen. Now, how do you respond regarding Longhua Temple? Yuan Zhao (Answer) said that when I took over management of the temple, it was already empty. I worked hard as abbot for several years and resigned because I could not maintain it. (Question) Did you open the cigarette factory? (Answer) No. (Question) Why are the cigarette factory's seals and other items in your possession? (Answer) Because I have a five hundred yuan share and am dismantling the shares. (Official) said: Nonsense. If you want to dismantle shares, you should settle the accounts within the company. Why are they at your home?</p>
<p>Yuan Zhao Was Speechless</p>
<p>At this point in the interrogation, Prosecutor Li Fen stood up and gave a legal argument. The official then ordered the debate to begin. First, lawyer Lu Qi briefly stated that when the old monk was alive, several old tenants renting houses at Hongshan Temple could prove that the temple property belonged to the old monk. The newly built houses all have fire insurance. The insurance policies were copied from Yuan Zhao's possession and insured with four or five insurance companies, using Hengli Ji Hengli Company and Ling Youyuan, etc., for more than 40,000 yuan. Since it is claimed to be Yan Wanglong's family property, why are the insurance policies kept by Yuan Zhao? Who was the owner before the 16th year of the Republic? It is clearly Hongshan Temple's public property. Moreover, this property deed has always been kept by the Mo Zijing family at the South Gate. After the old monk passed away, Yuan Zhao retrieved the property deed from the Mo family. Now, he requests the restoration of Hongshan Temple to its original state and the return of the Buddhist statues. If it cannot be fully restored, then a portion must be restored to house the Buddhist statues, with the rest being rented out as before to subsidize expenses. Yuan Zhao's nephew-in-law, Yan Wanglong, is selling these houses in Fu'an Lane to someone named Wang, asking for 27,000 yuan. Wang came to inquire whether there were any disputes regarding the purchase of this property. This lawyer replied that the lawsuit had not been resolved, so there would definitely be problems.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Deal Fell Through</p>
<p>Lawyer Pan Zhensheng then stated that Yuan Zhao stole and sold more than 115 mu of Longhua Temple's property, as well as seven Buddhist scriptures and a bronze Buddha (commonly known as the Prince Buddha), said to be over two thousand years old, all of which are very valuable and can be described as a world rarity. The Prince Buddha statue has one finger pointing to the sky and one finger pointing to the earth, with a value beyond estimation. Previously, Yuan Zhao colluded with Hu Su Ji to falsely create a contract, pretending that the seventy-six bungalows in front of the temple were Hu Su Ji's rented land for building houses. Because Longhua Temple was built during the Chiwu period of the Three Kingdoms and surrounds the Wangdai River, covering more than ninety mu of land, there was usually a shortage of grain and taxes. Yuan Zhao could not steal and sell the land, so he had a novel idea and played this trick of stealing the sky and changing the day. His means of plunder were undeniably clever, etc. Landowner Lu Mingzhao testified, requesting the recovery of the stolen and sold land and its return to Longhua Temple's management, etc. The interrogating official then said to Yuan Zhao: You previously said that the owner of the Hongshan Temple foundation was surnamed Feng, and the temple foundation was taken back by the Feng family. What do you have to say now? Yuan Zhao's answer was vague. The interrogating official obtained the confession and, believing that the case was clear, declared it closed and scheduled for judgment at 2 PM on the 28th of this month. Yan Wanglong was ordered to be sent to the prosecutor's office for detention pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Ten Professors Actively Promote the Construction of a China-Based Culture</h3>
<p>Collecting Literature as Material for Grasping Reality</p>
<p>Creating Forms to Solicit Opinions from People Across the Country</p>
<p>Offering Rewards for Essays to Seek the Effect of Collecting Ideas</p>
<p>After the publication of the Ten Professors' Declaration, those engaged in cultural undertakings, whether for or against it, paid considerable attention to it. Therefore, the signatories are also making extraordinary efforts to realize the declaration. It is estimated that there are three things in progress: one is collecting literature, the second is making forms, and the third is offering rewards for essays. The general situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Collecting Literature</p>
<p>The ten professors who published the Ten Professors' Declaration, because there are words in the declaration about reviewing the past, grasping the present, and creating the future, must have practical actions. After exchanging opinions, it was decided to start with reviewing the past and grasping the present, especially paying attention to grasping the present. The National Revolution of the 13th year of the Republic was designated as a period. Attempts were made to collect literature from the 13th year of the Republic to the present, including all specialized works and texts discussing political, economic, social, educational, and ideological issues in general publications. For each book or article collected, its main ideas are adopted and recorded for reference, in the hope that this literature will be helpful to the future cultural construction, and Sun Hanbing and Zhang Yi are designated as the persons in charge of this work. Sun and Zhang are now actively engaged in this work.</p>
<p>Creating Forms</p>
<p>The ten professors believe that cultural construction cannot be monopolized by a few people. They should collect ideas and avoid the disadvantages of a few people's monopoly. Therefore, it was decided to create forms and solicit opinions from leaders in various fields, specialized scholars, and newspaper reporters across the country. Then, the records are made, and statistics are added to find out what kind of propositions the Chinese people advocate most for the transformation of politics, society, economy, and ideology, and to report to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Initiating Essay Solicitation</p>
<p>Ten days after the publication of the Ten Professors' Declaration, an official of a certain institution in Shanghai and Nanjing planned to donate 500 yuan in savings to the ten professors for the purpose of soliciting essays. After investigation, it was found that this person's monthly income was only seventy or eighty yuan, but he saved ten yuan in the bank every month. Although the amount of 500 yuan is not huge, it is the crystallization of years of frugal living for this person. His will is extremely firm, so it was decided to accept this amount and formulate the following essay solicitation methods: (1) The essay award amount is set at 2,000 yuan, with the first prize being 500 yuan, the second prize being 300 yuan, the third prize being 200 yuan, the fourth and fifth prizes being 150 yuan each, the sixth to tenth prizes being 100 yuan each, and the eleventh to fifteenth prizes being 50 yuan each, totaling 2,000 yuan. (2) The topic of the essay is "How to Build a China-Based Culture." The essay should include four points: (1) the essence of culture, (2) the meaning of China-based culture, (3) the opinions of modern scholars on Chinese cultural issues, and (4) the principles and programs for building a China-based culture. (3) The essay solicitation date is from now until July 20, and the publication date is September 10. The publication is "Cultural Construction." (4) The number of words is 30,000 to 50,000. After the method was decided, the consent of Wang Shijie, Wang Yunwu, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Lifu, Chen Bulei, Guo Renyuan, Zhang Shouyong, Cai Yuanpei, and Jiang Menglin was solicited separately, and they were asked to serve as judges. The above-mentioned Zhushi has no expressed permission, so the ten professors plan to formally publish advertisements for essay solicitation in newspapers in the north and south within days.</p>
<p>Sectional Symposia</p>
<p>In addition to the above three things, the ten professors also plan to hold sectional symposia, dividing them into political, economic, and educational sections, etc., to exchange opinions separately. The first sectional symposium will be held in March, with education issues as the center of research.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Dispatches Personnel to Inspect Civic Education</h3>
<p>Wang Longzhang and Nine Others Have Departed</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters, in order to clarify the situation of civic education promotion in schools across the city at the beginning of the semester, due to changes in school training directors and civic teachers, specially dispatched Wang Longzhang, Zhu Yakui, Wang Guoping, Guo Shuliang, Yang Jialin, Ji Hao, and other nine people to depart immediately and begin inspections.

<p>Special Announcement</p>
<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Speech on Shanghai's School Education (V)</h3>
<p>When the United States returned the "Boxer Indemnity," educators held a meeting in a certain place. Some people said, "We can use this money to run 'universal education,' and at least a large portion of the money should be used for 'universal education' undertakings." But others said, "This is not allowed. If we use this money for national 'universal education,' this money will not be enough. The funding for 'primary school education' should be provided by each province and county themselves. We don't need to spend the Boxer Indemnity returned by the United States in bits and pieces in each province and county. It is better to use this money to run 'higher education'." Later, as a result of the debate, it was still decided to use this money to run "higher education" and send students to study abroad. The famous "Tsinghua University" was built with this money, and several other universities were also subsidized. Therefore, the "Sino-French," "Sino-Belgian," and "Sino-British" Boxer Indemnities were subsequently used for "higher education." I remember a few days ago a newspaper criticized students studying abroad, and it was said very well: "We spend a lot of money on students studying abroad. The money is no less than the money spent on primary school education, and it may even exceed it. But what do we get as a result?" Someone has calculated that the national higher education expenditure has increased from 3.9 million to 33.6 million in twenty years, while the number of students has only increased from 40,000 to 44,000. The waste is conceivable. However, students studying abroad and even university students are not necessarily willing to fulfill their obligations to the country and the nation in primary school education. Those illiterate "illiterates" and primary school students still rely on a few primary school teachers to teach there. Only a group of normal school graduates and secondary school students are responsible for this responsibility. However, students studying abroad return to the country to become officials or university professors, and most of them disdain to engage in this "mass education" cause and disdain to teach "illiterates." The people who advocated running "higher education" first in the past believed that if we run "higher education" and create "specialized talents," we should first develop the domestic industry and commerce. When the country becomes rich, then "primary school education" will naturally become popular. They themselves thought that this was "When the people are numerous, what more is to be added? Enrich them." If the whole country is prosperous, then build more schools so that everyone can enter school and receive education. This is called "When they are enriched, what more is to be added? Teach them." Their view is to have numerous people first, then enrich them, and then teach them after they are rich. However, if we continue to do this, looking at the current poor phenomenon in China, I am afraid that everyone will not even have a school to enter in the future. Everyone knows why China is poor. Our country's poverty is due to the underdeveloped industry and commerce. Then we have to ask where a group of specialized talents who study industry and commerce have gone. One more point, our country's poverty is indeed due to the underdeveloped industry and commerce, but in this era of 20th century production competition, we have not yet learned the ability to "produce," but we have already learned the most fashionable ability to "consume." For example, if others build skyscrapers, we have to live in 20-story洋房, if others take cars, we also have to take cars whenever we go out, even to wearing high hats, wearing formal suits, dancing, and drinking, everyone is "westernized." Who started these things? To be blunt, the first is "students studying abroad" and the second is "university students." We can say that there are definitely no primary school students who would be so "westernized," and definitely no old乡下 who would be so "westernized." So we feel very painful when we talk about it. The poverty of China and the lack of education of the people, part of the responsibility, must be borne by this group of "westernized" scholars. There are many unfair things in the world. Think about where the money for cultivating this group of students studying abroad comes from? Except for some students studying abroad who rely on their ancestors' blessings to have money to go abroad, the rest are always "official expenses." Where does this "official expense" come from? They are all the country's "donations and taxes." Where do the "donations and taxes" come from? They are all the country's "donations and taxes." Where do the "donations and taxes" come from? It is very sad to say, they are all extracted from our people. China has three major donations and taxes: (1) land tax, (2) customs duty, (3) salt tax. These donations and taxes are always added to everyone, regardless of wealth or poverty. In addition, there are "income tax" and "inheritance tax." Foreign countries have long had this method of specifically extracting donations and taxes from wealthy people, but we do not have it in China. I know that there is a rich man in Shanghai who sits at home and has an income of thousands or tens of thousands every day, but I have not heard of the country extracting any "income tax" from him. As for "land tax," it is mostly paid by farmers. "Customs duty" is also mostly paid by farmers. For example, China exports goods, mostly "agricultural products." These "agricultural products" are subject to customs declaration and taxation along the way, and they are all sold as "raw goods" at very cheap prices. Imported goods are always "finished goods." Most of these "finished goods" are daily necessities. Except for a part of "foreign goods" purchased by wealthy families, the rest of the daily necessities are almost sold to various villages in the interior. The donations and taxes on these goods are also added to the general working farmers who purchase them. In addition to the customs duty mentioned earlier, let's look at the "Boxer Indemnity," which was also extracted from customs duties. If we recall why there was the "Boxer Indemnity," it was because the "Boxers" wanted to "support the Qing and destroy the foreigners" that day. Later, they were defeated by the "Eight-Nation Alliance," and the foreigners signed the Treaty of Xin Chou with the Qing court. The foreigners felt that they had to punish China this time, so they asked our country to compensate for their military expenses. However, the indemnity was not calculated based on the number of troops deployed. They calculated it based on the population of China. The indemnity was 450 million Haiguan taels, which is equivalent to fining each Chinese person one tael. Moreover, this indemnity was amortized over 39 years and interest was added. Calculated on the basis of principal and interest, it amounted to 988.223815 million taels, which is equivalent to each Chinese person being fined two taels of Haiguan silver.</p>

<h3>Knowledge of Repairing Heterodyne Radio</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mingxiang</p>
<p>Amateur radio researchers may often feel that the principle of heterodyne radios is profound and the structure is complex. Occasionally encountering a broken heterodyne radio, they simply don't know where to start. In fact, the signal frequency (high frequency) amplification, sound frequency amplification, and power supply of heterodyne radios are no different from the commonly seen adjusted high frequency radios. If readers can understand these components completely, then the difficult problems concerning these three components can be solved easily, and this article will not elaborate further.</p>
<p>The reason why heterodyne radios are considered complex is that in addition to the three components, there are also oscillating stages, primary and secondary detection stages, Chinese frequency amplification stages, and various heterodyne reception devices, which cause many difficult problems. This article is limited to explaining the special problems of this heterodyne radio and the repair methods.</p>
<p>Essential Instruments</p>
<p>If a workman wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools. The first essential instrument for repairing heterodyne radios is an electric meter, such as a DC voltmeter, milliammeter, ohmmeter, etc., which are all necessary. However, it is too extravagant to prepare all of them. Fortunately, these electric meters can be used interchangeably. If a radio analyzer (the method of making this device will be described in another article) can be assembled, it will be especially convenient to use.</p>
<p>In addition to the electric meter, the special instrument needed to repair heterodyne radios is an oscillator, which must be able to generate oscillation within the full broadcast band and intermediate frequency band, and its frequency must be absolutely calibrated.</p>
<p>Harmonics</p>
<p>Unless it is a pure sine wave, alternating current often has harmonics higher than its own frequency. When a vacuum tube works in a radio, its characteristic curve can never be a pure straight line. Even the so-called straight line part is slightly curved, so the sine wave is distorted, and many harmonics are often generated.</p>
<p>Harmonics are often multiples of the frequency itself, such as the second harmonic, which is twice the frequency itself, three times three times, four times four times, and so on. The closer the harmonics are to the frequency itself, the stronger the power. For example, the harmonics of the second or third镒, sometimes even the fifth harmonic, can cause interference to the radio. The fourth harmonic of the intermediate frequency of 175KC is 4×175=700KC, that is, the eighth harmonic of this frequency itself is still within the broadcast range. If the radio's isolation device has a slight defect, this harmonic is often easily mixed with the external signal frequency and generates heterodyne action, causing the radio to fail to work legally.</p>
<p>Let's give another example to illustrate. Suppose the radio is tuned to a radio station with a frequency of 690KC. The intermediate frequency stage of the radio is 175KC, then the oscillating stage should be adjusted to 865KC. If the fifth harmonic of the intermediate frequency of 875KC is input into the circuit with the signal frequency for some reason, it will generate a beat frequency of 10000 cycles (Veatfrequency). If the sound frequency stage cannot cut off this frequency, a very sharp strange scream will occur in the loudspeaker. If the intermediate frequency stage is not properly matched, causing the frequency to be slightly lower than 175KC, this symptom will be more likely to occur. Now assume that the intermediate frequency is 174KC. When receiving the same radio station, the oscillating stage frequency must be 864KC. This frequency may be confused with the fifth harmonic of 174KC, which is 870KC, resulting in a beat frequency of 6000 cycles. This frequency is extremely easy to generate a mad scream in the sound frequency stage. Therefore, the intermediate frequency matching problem of heterodyne radios is extremely important, with 175KC being the most suitable. Furthermore, if the oscillating stage frequency and the signal frequency have been accurately matched to be 175KC apart, but the intermediate frequency stage cannot be matched to the same frequency, the radio's sensitivity will be greatly affected, and the effectiveness will be completely lost. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Talking About "Quartz Crystal"</h3>
<p>— A Layman</p>
<p>The range of a shortwave transmitter depends not on the size of the power, but on the stability of the oscillation frequency. If it can be adjusted appropriately, a shortwave transmitter with only five or ten watts of power can easily achieve cross-ocean communication. There are many ways to stabilize the frequency, but the most effective is to use a quartz crystal.</p>
<p>An oscillator that uses a quartz crystal to control the oscillation frequency is called a "Crystal Controlled Oscillator." Such an oscillator uses the "Piezo-electric effect" of the quartz crystal to control the oscillation frequency. With this kind of oscillator, the frequency is entirely determined by the size of the crystal: therefore, under normal circumstances, changes in the values ​​in the circuit, heating of the vacuum tube, and fluctuations in the high-voltage power supply should not affect the stability of the frequency. Therefore, this kind of radio communication is not only easy to listen to, but also has a very clear and beautiful tone.</p>
<p>When a quartz crystal is subjected to pressure or tension, an electric field is generated around it. Conversely, when we place it in an electric field, its physical form changes. This effect is called the "piezoelectric effect." Quartz crystals can be used to stabilize oscillation frequency because of this piezoelectric effect. There are actually many things that have a piezoelectric effect. However, quartz is the most suitable, so it is the most widely used.</p>
<p>Naturally occurring quartz crystals are colorless and transparent hexagonal prisms. In Crystallogy, a complete quartz crystal has three "Axes," called X, Y, and Z axes. See the attached diagram for details, where the dotted lines represent the axes. Mined quartz must be cut and polished before it can be used. There are X-cut and Y-cut methods; the details are self-evident in the figure, where the black shadows are the locations of the cut pieces. The X-cut method is also commonly called the vertical cut method, or the Curie cut. The Y-cut method is also called the parallel cut method, or the 30 degree cut.</p>
<p>The X-cut method and the Y-cut method each have their advantages. The Y-cut method is relatively easier to oscillate, but sometimes there are two oscillation frequencies, so the X-cut method is used more often.</p>
<p>The thickness of a fully polished quartz crystal is directly related to the oscillation frequency. According to test results, for the X-cut method, f × t = 112.6; for the Y-cut method, f × t = 77.0; where f is the oscillation frequency in kilohertz, and t is the thickness of the crystal in inches.</p>
<p>The frequency range that such a quartz crystal can achieve is from several kilohertz to fourteen megahertz, but in actual use it is only from forty kilohertz to seven megahertz. Because, as we know from the previous paragraph, the thickness of the quartz crystal is inversely proportional to the oscillation frequency; although theoretically, we can obtain any hypothetical frequency as long as we grind the crystal to an appropriate thickness, the lower frequencies require very large pieces of raw material, which is impossible in fact due to the limitations of natural production; at the same time, crystals with higher frequencies are not suitable because they are extremely thin and easily broken.</p>
<p>During grinding, because quartz is very hard, a grinding agent made of kerosene and fine diamond powder is used for grinding. A well-made quartz crystal is approximately one inch square, its two surfaces should be parallel to each other without unevenness, the surface should be free of oil, and if it is an X-cut, its surface should be perpendicular to the X-axis; for the Y-cut, they should be parallel to each other. Therefore, without appropriate tools and instruments, it is better to buy ready-made products than to grind them yourself. When using it to control oscillation, it should be clamped between two metal plates; there are also crystal holders specially made for this purpose on the market, which are very convenient to purchase.</p>
<p>The quartz crystal in the crystal-controlled oscillator is connected to the grid circuit of the oscillation tube, replacing the variable capacitor and coil in the original grid circuit. Of course, various oscillation circuits can be replaced in this way, but the screen-grid resonant type is the best. Now, let's take a screen-grid resonant crystal-controlled oscillation circuit as an example, as shown in the attached diagram. No more will be said.</p>
<p>To do long-distance communication with low power, using a quartz crystal controlled oscillator is the best there is.</p>
<h3>Various Types of Detection (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Si Lian</p>
<p>(4) Full-wave detection is the same as half-wave detection, except that the dual-grid does not use parallel full-wave detection. During rectification, its input can be averaged, and it can prevent the carrier frequency from flowing into the triode part, which is its advantage. See Figure 4.</p>
<p>(5) Push-pull detection. Everyone knows that push-pull audio frequency amplification has a very strong amplification power, so using it as push-pull detection can also produce wonderful effects. Figure 5 shows its circuit diagram. R is a four-megaohm resistor, which is used here as a grid leak. After testing the No. 19 vacuum tube, it can indeed reach far. Receiving the Nanjing Central Radio Station is already very loud in the loudspeaker. Selectivity and Sensitivity are excellent, almost equivalent to adding a stage of radio frequency amplification. The author had already tried to install this type of detection last year, but the vacuum tube was not No. 19, but two No. 30 vacuum tubes, and the results were very satisfactory. Now that there are composite vacuum tubes for sale, it should be much more convenient. (End)</p>

<p>Millimeter Wave Communication Shows Promise</p>
<p>"Vatican City," "Papal Palace," and "Centaer Fort" near Rome are experimenting with millimeter-wave communication. The distance between the two places is twenty kilometers. The wavelength used is sixty centimetres (Centimetres), which is twenty-three and a half inches. It is reported that the test results are very good, and research is continuing to seek new developments.</p>
<h3>A Powerful Tool for Long-Distance Radio Reception</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>——Testing an Antenna Tuner</p>
<p>——Can Increase Output Power by Up to Seven Times——</p>
<p>Although the antenna tuner introduced in this article (Tenatuner) has a very great effect, the internal structure is actually not that mysterious after all. It is just a very simple resonator. When receiving broadcasts from nearby areas, the device can increase the selectivity of the radio. When receiving broadcasts from distant areas, it can increase the output volume and reduce input noise. It is indeed an indispensable tool for general long-distance radio enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The attached diagram shows the wiring method of the device. C1, C2, and C3 are three-gang variable capacitors (the capacitance of each section is .000365 mfd, and after being connected in parallel, it is approximately .001 mfd.). The coil is wound with 150 turns of No. 24 double silk-covered wire on a cylinder with a diameter of three inches and a length of four and a half inches. A tap is taken from each of the 5th, 20th, 50th, and 100th turns—a total of six taps including the beginning and end—and connected to screws 2 to 7. The entire device is installed in an aluminum or copper shielding box. Except for the ground wire terminal, all other parts must be insulated from the metal box.</p>
<p>When using, first connect the wires as shown in the diagram (whether the metal box needs to be grounded must be determined after experimentation; sometimes not grounding the wire can actually improve efficiency). Then, turn the switch SW2 (starting from point 2; point 1 is for the antenna to directly receive the radio). At the same time, adjust the variable capacitor until the radio receives the loudest volume and the clearest sound quality (when adjusting longer wavelengths, if you feel that the capacitance is insufficient, you can turn on the switch SW1).</p>
<p>The simplicity of using this device is as described above, but there is one more thing to pay attention to: when receiving radio stations of any wavelength, it is best to use less inductance and more capacitance. In other words: when resonating, the fewer the number of turns of the coil and the greater the capacitance of the capacitor, the better the results. According to experiments, when the frequency is 600KC, switching SW2 to point 6 can obtain an output power of 7.25. If SW2 is moved to point 7 and the capacitance is increased again, although the circuit can still be resonated, the output power will immediately decrease to 5.3 times—a loss of about one-third.</p>
<p>The following table shows the increase in output power after using the antenna tuner. The table shows the results obtained by American radio experts after using precision instruments for testing. When the frequency is 600KC, the output power is approximately 7.25 times or 17.2 decibels; (please refer to the author's article "The Ratio of Power to Volume" in issue 43 of this journal.) When the frequency is 1500KC, the output power is approximately 1.8 times or 5.1 decibels. The average output power is approximately five times or fourteen decibels.</p>
<h3>Comparison of Longwave and Shortwave Communication</h3>
<p>— Chong Ling</p>
<p>Shortwave</p>
<p>(1) Shortwave requires simpler transmitting and receiving equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Shortwave antennas are quite short and their structure is also simple.</p>
<p>(3) Shortwave communication can achieve extremely long distances with minimal electrical power.</p>
<p>(4) Shortwave receivers have very sharp resonance, and signals are not easily disturbed by each other.</p>
<p>(5) Atmospheric noise has very little impact on shortwave machines.</p>
<p>(6) But geomagnetic storm disturbances are more pronounced on shortwave.</p>
<p>(7) For shortwave communication, the time and distance of the wave must be properly configured.</p>
<p>(8) Shortwave's ability to reflect off the Heaviside layer is far superior to that of longwave.</p>
<p>(9) Because the ground wave is absorbed and disappears in shortwave communication, and the reflected wave travels far, a skip distance is created, resulting in a silent zone in the middle distance.</p>
<p>(10) Shortwave is prone to the phenomenon of echo signals.</p>
<p>Longwave</p>
<p>(1) Longwave requires more complex transmitting and receiving equipment.</p>
<p>(2) Longwave antennas are very long, and the equipment is also more expensive.</p>
<p>(3) Longwave communication over the same distance requires greater electrical power.</p>
<p>(4) Longwave receivers cannot have sharp resonance, so reception is easily interfered with.</p>
<p>(5) Longwave machines are greatly affected by atmospheric noise.</p>
<p>(6) Longwave is very little affected by geomagnetic storms.</p>
<p>(7) Longwave communication and the distance it can reach are less affected by time.</p>
<p>(8) But longwave propagates along the ground and is not as easily absorbed by the ground as shortwave.</p>
<p>(9) Longwave has no skip distance phenomenon.</p>
<p>(10) Longwave is not like this.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The 23rd Issue Plummets and Trading is Suspended</p>
<p>Margin Calls Extended Trading to After 4 PM</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Business Securities Exchange was extremely busy with trading on the last day of this month's futures. However, a huge disturbance suddenly arose in the 23rd issue. There are many hidden facts in this matter, which are impossible to investigate. The number of accounts in February was only over 2 million. Most of the receivers were powerful figures, and there should have been no disturbance. However, the shorts recklessly reduced prices and sold wildly, causing a sharp drop of more than four yuan in the morning, which should have been suspended. However, because it was the last day of February futures, there were still two sessions in the afternoon, but margin calls were collected, and trading only resumed after 4 PM. When trading reached the 23rd issue, the exchange suddenly announced that the Bureau of Social Affairs had ordered that those already suspended that day could not be traded again. The brokers argued repeatedly, causing disputes, and the start of trading was delayed for another hour. The market price still showed no improvement. However, the news about the 23rd issue was extremely complex. The Ministry of Finance took out the 23rd issue from various banks with other collateral, in a significant amount. Some say that the Ministry of Finance still only intends to recover the 23rd issue and issue the 24th issue. Others say that it conflicts with legislation. People are confused and do not know what to do. Therefore, the 23rd issue has once again entered a state of confusion. The future turmoil is just beginning. The market situation yesterday was as follows: at the opening in the morning, most bond markets continued to have short squeezes, rising by one or two dimes. However, the 23rd issue plummeted by two yuan and four dimes due to the selling by Nos. 21.48 and 49, etc. The forward issue also fell by one yuan and one dime. The market price was slightly chaotic in the second session, with highs and lows alternating due to the different positions of the longs and shorts, ranging from five cents one dime to three dimes. The 23rd issue in February actually plummeted by another one yuan and seven dimes, and a suspension was announced.

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Bullish Forces Emerge, Standard Silver Bar Price Only Drops One Yuan</p>
<p>Market Situation Fluctuates Throughout the Day</p>
<p>The gold market was relatively stable yesterday, with moderate investor sentiment. Major players mostly took profits, resulting in ordinary trading volume, making it susceptible to downward pressure. However, due to the Central Bank's frequent cash injections, buying interest remained high, with numerous bullish positions. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw the British pound rise and the U.S. dollar hold steady, while the Montry silver price slightly contracted, and exchange rates also declined. London spot gold rose one and a half pence. In off-exchange preliminary trading, the initial price was 089 yuan, but due to a surge of profit-takers, it immediately fell. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed the British pound steady and the U.S. dollar contracting. The Customs Gold Unit rose by two li. The standard silver bar price was 936 yuan and two jiao. The morning opening was still low. After the opening, major players actively bought, causing the price to rise immediately. However, due to renewed buying activity, market sentiment slightly improved, and buying interest was stimulated. Speculator Luo bought in, briefly pushing the price above the ten-yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the supply increased sharply at the high price, causing it to fall again. At this point, banks were still bidding, and the Central Bank also settled prior orders. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) exchange rate announcement showed the British pound steady and the U.S. dollar contracting. Subsequently, there were repeated rebounds, but the supply from limited positions was substantial, making it difficult to break through the ten-yuan mark, resulting in much fluctuation. Later, the White Silver Equalization Tax announcement showed no change, and the Central Bank's spot purchases did not provide much stimulus, only a slight struggle. The overall trend remained weak, lacking the strength to rise. Selling pressure gradually increased, and despite the support of major players, the supply exceeded demand. At noon, the situation reversed and weakened. The afternoon market opened flat. Then, as the Central Bank and others continued to bid at low prices, major players actively chased purchases, causing the price to gradually rebound. However, many profit-takers emerged at the high price, and the market soon weakened again. The initial Indian silver price report was slightly lower, then gradually rose. Later, the Central Bank injected cash again, reviving investor sentiment. The second Indian silver price report still showed a contraction, and the price rose again. However, due to continued profit-taking by major players, trading was sluggish and lacked support, causing it to decline slightly again. Ultimately, there were still many short-covering positions, and the market closed stable. After the close, it became weak again. The difference between the Central Bank's cash injection price and the forward standard silver bar price was slightly less than eight yuan, causing the swap discount to fall to seven and a half yuan. The day's market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 905 yuan and seven jiao, a decline of three yuan and three jiao from the previous close. Yongfeng, Yuanyi, Huixiang, Fuyu, Yongli, Futaiheng, Yongde, Dafa Yong, Hengchang Yong, and others advanced to eight yuan and eight jiao.

Dada, Yuanyi, and Hengyu were still advancing, learning that HSBC's exchange rate announcement showed the British pound steady and the U.S. dollar contracting by 1875, rising to ten yuan. Hua Bi released April shillings at 125. Dafa Yong, Yifeng Yong, Hengyu, and Qianchangxiang took advantage of the situation to supply, falling to 08 yuan. At this time, because the Central Bank repeatedly bid for April shillings at 125 and May at 5 pence, Dalian gang Fuyu, Fuxing Yong, and Yuanyi sold to seven yuan and a half. Mai Jia Li bid for May U.S. dollars at 625. Hengyu, Yongli, and Chang Dali bought, rising to ten yuan. Hengchang Yong, Hengyu, and Fu'an took advantage of the high price to take profits, falling to seven yuan and seven jiao. The White Silver Equalization Tax announcement showed no change.

Although Futaiheng advanced, there was also news of the Central Bank injecting cash, but investor sentiment was moderate, retreating to eight yuan. Hengyu and Hanheng still made slight acquisitions, once rising to nine yuan and one jiao. After this, investor sentiment gradually weakened, Hengyu, Hengchang Yong, Yuanmaoji, Dafa Yong, Fusheng Yong, and Fuchang actively took profits, gradually falling to six yuan and one jiao.

After the close, Yingxiang, Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Wanxing, and others supplied strips, gradually falling to within seven yuan. The highest price during the day was 910 yuan and four jiao, and the lowest price was 905 yuan and seven jiao, a fluctuation of four yuan and seven jiao. As a result, it fell slightly by one yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 93 yuan and two jiao based on the Central Bank's standard silver bar price, approximately 28 yuan lower than the closing price, about 2 yuan more than the previous close. The March registration price was 895 yuan, and the April price was 9 yuan. The pure gold price was 1 yuan less than the forward standard silver bar price, at 904 yuan and seven jiao. The spot market situation was calm, and it was still difficult to trade. Tianjin goods were 2 and a half yuan higher than the forward standard silver bar price, but there were few sellers. The swap discount was cheap, as the Central Bank's cash injection price favored bullish positions, only about 8 yuan. Fuyu posted 35 strips to Runchangyu at 9 yuan and four jiao. Hengyu posted 70 strips to Dingtai at 9 yuan and one jiao. Shenkang posted 7 strips to Qingfayong at 9 yuan. Dingtai posted 35 strips each to Futaiheng and Dafengheng at 8 yuan and eight jiao. Yuanmaoyong posted 70 strips to Futaiheng at the same price. The Central Bank's direct cash injections favored bullish positions, so Fuchang posted 7 strips to Qingfayong, only 7 and a half yuan. Later in the market, Tongtaichang posted 70 strips to Dafengheng and 28 strips to Futaiheng, and Yifeng Yong posted 7 strips, all at 8 yuan.

<p>The Financial Market Lacks Vigor</p>
<p>Recently, the silver market is normally in the open loan season, but this year, due to being bound by the situation, it is not yet the time to fully develop, and it depends on how relaxed it can be in the future, so the financial market has been quite lacking in vigor in recent days. The overnight call loan rate was 9 fen in the morning and afternoon, and the added water interest was 2 fen. The bill trading volume was more than 2.7 million in the morning and more than 400,000 in the afternoon. The loan redemption transaction was more than 500,000, and the new loan was more than 700,000.

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Sharp Drop in Cotton Yarn at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Yarn Lower by 8.5 Yuan Compared to Last Month…Cotton Lower by 1.75 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market trend has turned weak again. Due to the ongoing financial tension, investor sentiment is solely focused on falling prices, so the environment is slightly unfavorable, and the declining trend is even sharper. However, an investigation of the market shows that the more financially strong bullish and bearish sides are inclined toward the bullish side. General retail investors are selling off due to the declining overall situation. This month's yarn is the last day, and the competition between the bullish and bearish sides is extremely fierce. In the afternoon, the bearish side broke the five-yuan mark at the end of the session, to 174 yuan and a half, which is 8 and a half yuan lower than the end-of-month price of 185 yuan in January.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Breaks Through Five Yuan This Month</p>
<p>At the pre-market opening for standard yarn, all months showed a calm trend, but there was still little vitality in the market. Because this month's expiring yarn is said to be more than 3,000 bales according to the market, the bearish side planned to break the 75-yuan mark. The opening was quite oppressive for this month's yarn. However, the buying side had major players and connections to certain parties, and were already prepared to receive the goods. The first two or three auctions were still stable. Unexpectedly, sellers gathered at the close, and the market suddenly changed. As a result, all months fell by 2.4 jiao. In the afternoon, the opening for this month was the last day, and the bearish side launched a fierce attack. However, Yudahao also resisted with all its strength, breaking the six-yuan mark in the first auction, to five yuan and eight jiao. However, the forward month was loose and out of control. The second auction returned to one jiao, and the third auction regained the six-yuan mark. The situation changed suddenly at the close. The bearish side dumped a large number of chips, which shows the painstaking efforts of that side. The smallest bid was 170 yuan, and the bullish front line wavered, and the situation became more serious. Later, a certain number, probably with the assistance of a certain party, dragged in more than 1,000 bales according to the market price, and the market price turned up, to 174 yuan and a half, a sudden drop of 1.6 yuan compared to the third auction price. However, the forward month bullish base was safe and sound. As a result, all forward months fell by 5.6.7 jiao. An investigation revealed that Tongji sold 850 bales, Hexing 600 bales, Lankang 1,950 bales, Daji 400 bales, Shenji 1,150 bales, and Changfeng 1,000 bales. The buying parties were Daji 650 bales, Taixing 800 bales, Yukang 800 bales, Yuda 650 bales, Yuanda 650 bales, Minghua 550 bales, Tongxing 500 bales, and Yichang 500 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Opened at 1,000 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were more than before. It was found that the total number of purchases by various gangs throughout the day was 1,000 bales. The market situation was not very prosperous or degraded. The purchase amounts of various gangs are as follows:</p>
<p>After the flower market rebounded the previous day, the declining trend is becoming more intense today. The reality is that the economy is tight and the amount of cotton stored in Shanghai has increased. Although deliveries this month are not very enthusiastic, the silver crunch has reduced the number of receivers. Yesterday was the last day of this month, and the five-yuan mark was broken in the afternoon. The closing price was 34 yuan and six jiao, which is 1 yuan and 7 and a half jiao lower than the end-of-month price of 36 yuan and 3 and a half jiao in January.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Retreats Five Yuan This Month</p>
<p>At the pre-market opening for standard cotton, the overall trend for each month was stable, as U.S. cotton fell slightly by two pounds and Indian cotton fell by 1.5 rupees. However, the market was tighter due to a major player buying the previous day. At the second auction, it suddenly turned weak, as the amount of deliveries this month was not large, the financial threat reduced the number of receivers, and the selling trend started again. All months fell by one jiao to one and a half jiao. In the afternoon, this month was the last day, and the seller's intention was that it would not be reassuring unless the five-yuan mark was broken. Therefore, the battle between the bullish and bearish sides for this month was extremely intense. The five-yuan mark was indeed broken by the bearish side in the first auction, to four yuan and eight jiao. The forward month also wavered, as the selling side surged like a tide. The second auction still fell by one jiao and a half, and the third auction did not move. A portion of the forward month bought low, rebounding by one jiao and a half. At the close, a portion of this month's receivers did not deliver the goods, and the market atmosphere was calm, with no drastic changes. At the same time, it was heard that 10,000 dan of spot cotton were traded, and investor sentiment rose slightly. As a result, this month fell by 4 and a half jiao, and the forward month fell by one jiao to one and a half jiao. An investigation revealed that Jifeng sold 3,800 dan, Dafeng 6,300 dan, Jinchang 2,400 dan, Changhe 3,500 dan, Suilong 1,500 dan, Daji 1,500 dan, Yicheng 1,600 dan, Changfeng 2,700 dan, and Runkang 2,100 dan. The buying parties were Dafu 3,100 dan, Tongji 2,900 dan, Tongxing 4,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,800 dan, Yuanda 4,000 dan, Zhenda 1,600 dan, Dachang 2,100 dan, Yikang 1,200 dan, Yukang 1,100 dan, and Changyu 1,100 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Sales Exceed 10,000 Dan</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are active, and both Chinese and foreign manufacturers are launching purchases, estimated at more than 10,000 dan, sourced from 150 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Lack of New Buyers for U.S. Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with a rise or fall of one or two pounds compared to the previous day. The industry closed out bullish March positions and bought forward months. The market price was slightly soft, and investor sentiment was stable. Transactions were mostly for hedging. Liverpool gangs bought March and sold forward months. There were not many new buyers. The industry is waiting for Washington's progress on the new cotton policy and the more obvious development of various businesses. Later, the sell-off by bullish parties and the sale of New Orleans continued to weaken. The close was flat and tired (the 22nd was Washington's birthday and was a holiday). Spot prices did not move, and futures fell by two to three pounds. The British cotton market was weak, with spot prices rising by two points and futures falling by one point. Indian cotton was tired due to the sale of futures merchants and the lack of assistance from buyers, with Pingguoer falling by 0.25 rupees, Aomula falling by half a rupee, and Bailuoxi falling by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram record is on the left (telegram on the 21st).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 22nd was 246 rupees, up a quarter of a rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Forward Flour Covers Shorts, Forward Wheat Cuts Longs</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the price of foreign wheat rose by about one or two jiao in Chicago, and by eight fen to one jiao or more in Canada. When the prices opened, the market in each month was generally stagnant, and transactions were few. Because this month is close to delivery, floating shorts are covered, and the market sentiment has turned stable. There were few entries and exits in the forward month, and there was no vitality. Until the afternoon opening, because factories covered, investor sentiment turned slightly bullish, and the outside industry slightly transacted in the forward month, and the trend also stabilized. In the future, actual sales will be active, and it can be expected to stand firm, otherwise it will be difficult to be overly bullish. As a result, this month was better by half a fen, April was better by 2.5 li, and the rest were all unchanged.</p>
<p>In the forward wheat market, although foreign wheat was better by one or two jiao or more, at the opening price, this month only had one or two days of trading due to the approaching delivery date. Generally, floating longs were in urgent need of closing out, and due to the silver relationship, there was no intention to recover on the hedging side, so the lowest price was 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 7 fen. The March price also fell to 3 yuan and 8 jiao and 6 fen. Until the afternoon opening, it was still flat at the beginning. Then, the short head slightly covered, returning to one or two fen. However, the combined price of spot foreign wheat is gradually loosening, and the prospect should be less than the hope of being good. As a result, this month was a little less by one fen, March was a little less by three fen, and April was a little less by six fen. The spot wheat market was slightly weak, and the price of medium and inferior goods fell by one or two fen. Delivery was not smooth. The opening price of Shandong Suzhou wheat was 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen, and the opening price of Bengbu wheat was 3 yuan and 9 jiao. Shen Da sold 400 bales, and Fuxin sold 1,500 bales.</p>
<p>The overseas wheat market stabilized due to rumors of strong winds and dust in the southwestern winter wheat belt. Manufacturers cancelled the May hedging. Due to the large inventories and slow sales of Canadian wheat, some parties doubted the permanence of the pegged price of Canadian wheat.</p>
<p>Inferior Foreign Rice Sales Are Active and Stable</p>
<p>—Ke Xian Seeks Lower Prices—</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market was due to the high market price, and mainland gangs paid attention to inferior foreign rice instead of consulting. And the cargo owners, because it was useless to dismiss it, had a lot of desire to sell out. The price of machine milled rice and city rice was uniformly reduced by three to five fen, and Hunan oil rice and Shashi machine milled rice of 1,000 packs was handled by the local dealers. There are more than 2 loads of long-grain Saigon rice stored, but the guest has not moved, and the number of sales on the street is limited, so the price continues to be nearly a jiao. However, the sub-Saigon rice and broken rice are still welcomed by the mainland, and the price is also stable. The total number of transactions was 3,000 bags of No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon, 3,200 bags of No. 3 and broken rice, and 200 tons of No. 3. The future market is still looking at the problem of sub-rice having a customer base, and the others are generally flat.</p>
<p>He Xia Rice Slightly Lower by Several Fen</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs were similar to the previous one, only up to the 17th and 18th, a total of 3,600 to 3,700 stones of goods. Retail sales continued to slack. Fortunately, the consignment had nearly 1,000 bags from the Beiping and Qingdao gangs, so the market color was slightly tired, and the market price of each cargo depreciated slightly. However, in view of the future market situation, affected by the economy, I am afraid that there will be no great improvement. Yinbian's Yuanyin Fandan moved and saw a settlement, and Duyangjian had no market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about Nianhao arrived at the dock in He Xia. The market digestion was slack, and the price of Shangzhong Beigeng rice was short several fen, and the inferior one settled. Zhongci Zaobo Daoxiao was seven or eight fen, and other colors were also soft. Although the guest's sharp removal of the stomach was not refreshing, the price was firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Moroccan Green Tea Market Is Up and Down</p>
<p>Recently, news came from Morocco that the local Chinese green tea market has mixed successes and setbacks, with rises and falls. Chouxin's ordinary Zhenmei green tea has been imported in large quantities last year, and the market is flooded, but the market is still depressed. Purchasing power is quite reduced. In the past two months, the market price has gradually fallen, averaging at the end of last year, each dan saw 35 francs, and Zhucha also fell by one or twenty francs. However, needle eyebrow and Xiuxiu eyebrow and other items have seen a sharp increase in sales due to their low value, and the market price has increased by more than twenty francs. This situation is still difficult to be considered optimistic for the future of this year's tea market.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>The Asphalt Rise Is Just Beginning</p>
<p>Chongjing Head Disc Opens at Fifteen Taels and Two Qian</p>
<p>Since the Chongju of Hanshi and Jinshi opened at fourteen taels after the asphalt market, the air in the local market has changed. Although the industry players agreed that there were no heavy boulders in the spring market for 23 yuan, each line only sold between 22 yuan and 68 jiao. At first, I didn't expect the opening of the Hanshi market to be so high, so I immediately increased the sale to 24 yuan, and the goods sold were all borrowed and installed, and the borrowed goods sold at a great loss, which was really beyond expectations. However, the upward trend in Hanshi is just beginning. The telecommunication from the previous day said that Chongjing was opened at 15 taels and two yuan. Macheng Oil was 14 taels, and four yuan, the price was the same. If so, another one or two yuan were added, and it was said that no one was willing to sell at the original price, and there was still a trend of adding more. After receiving the telegram in this port, Chongjing was increased by 25 yuan and eight jiao. Tao households came to scramble for it after hearing the news. The industry had no goods to sell, so there were really many people who held it to the corner, and the beauty of the market was unparalleled. Some people went to the Hangzhou industry to handle it, but it was also replied that there were no goods. It can be seen that the lack of oil is the same everywhere, not only in Hanshi and Shanghai, so I am afraid that the market must be added again.</p>

<h3>Literary Contingency and Necessity</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiangshan</p>
<p>The problem of contingency and necessity in literature is treated in the same way as the problem of contingency and necessity in philosophy. The opinion of critics who obliterate contingency and excessively emphasize necessity has been frequently seen recently. Perhaps because writers excessively utilize contingency to unfold the overall story of their works, critics tend to obliterate contingency.</p>
<p>In old Chinese novels, contingency simply dominates necessity; the two are not linked together. Especially in novels of talented scholars and beautiful ladies, the loss or gifting of a handkerchief or jade pendant often triggers the story's progression. Even in early emerging literature, the depiction of a protagonist's turn or the unfolding of a grand scene relies on a very far-fetched contingency to cascade down. This phenomenon inevitably leaves scars on the work and makes readers feel it is comical and abrupt.</p>
<p>Naturalist writers, who are most faithful to the depiction of facts, do not regard contingent events as natural. Maupassant once said: "When choosing a subject, the artist only selects the necessary and special events from a life full of contingent and worthless events, and removes the contingent events."</p>
<p>"Indeed, many people die in a day due to unexpected disasters, but must artists also depict these unexpected disasters in order to be faithful to the facts? Must they depict the protagonist's head being broken by a falling brick or crushed by a wheel in the middle of the story?"</p>
<p>Indeed, contingency cannot occupy a leading position in creation, because the more contingency there is, the less real it feels; however, the importance of contingency cannot be absolutely denied either.</p>
<p>Originally, in the process of our understanding of reality, necessity and contingency are interconnected and appear on the surface of phenomena. If we absolutely obliterate and deny it because contingency is not easy to blend with reality, then it is too mechanical, that is, too focused on necessity. In fact, the author's skillful handling of these two things can most faithfully express reality. The two are indispensable to each other, and relying solely on necessity is useless. Because the general denial of contingency and the absolute recognition of necessity will inevitably lead to fatalism, that is, belief in an immovable fate. Hegel said: "Due to the general denial of contingency, only simple and direct necessity dominates everything in nature. If we use this kind of necessity as the foundation of philosophy, then we cannot step out of the boundaries of the theological view of nature."</p>
<p>However, how exactly does the writer skillfully handle these two things? In order to explain this problem, let's start with an example to help!</p>
<p>Tolstoy's "Resurrection" not only exposed the judicial system of the Imperial era, but also gave us great lessons, especially in necessity and contingency.</p>
<p>Nekhlyudov seduced Katyusha, a maid in his aunt's house, and had a physical relationship, causing Katyusha to become pregnant and subsequently a prostitute, and was accused of murder. When she was being tried, Nekhlyudov happened to be a juror. As a result, Nekhlyudov began to seek pardon for her, and abandoned his title and distributed his property to track her down to Siberia. The key point of this story is that Nekhlyudov happened to be present in court during the trial. If he had not been present in court, then the story would have had to be interrupted. So this point is a very contingent event. But does this contingent encounter damage the effect of Tolstoy's work? No, because the contingency here is connected to the necessary process in the overall structure.</p>
<p>While tightly grasping the fate of the individual who is typically set, Tolstoy wants to unfold the decisive social problems of the era. By describing the concrete mutual relationships of people living in this situation, and by describing the society they live in with conflicts, he can concretely explain the living connection between contingency and necessity, and the difficult to decompose contradiction. Here, the contingency stopped is a contingent matter, because necessity is revealed in contingency. At the same time, necessity stopped is a necessary matter, because it is due to contingency giving the motive.</p>
<p>Someone once said: "Contingent things have a basis, because they are contingent. But they do not have any basis of the same degree, because they are contingent. Thus, contingent things are necessary, and necessity defines itself as contingency. On the other hand, contingency is also absolute necessity."</p>
<p>Similarly, in literature, when we deal with these two things, first we must analyze historical necessity. We must analyze the protagonist's age, origin, education, and environment, and generally assume their historical mission. Second, we must make this necessity pass through all contingencies and lead to its necessary path. That is to say, the family relies on contingency to develop its necessity, but the important thing is that the basis of necessity must be shown in contingency. Otherwise, it will become an arbitrary arrangement, like a rare treasure falling from the sky. This situation is like the scholar in old Chinese novels encountering difficulties and always being rescued by a chivalrous person, which is generally sudden and rare.</p>
<p>In short, we cannot forcibly separate necessity and contingency; we must connect them with each other. Simply put, it is to "make them seamless." That is, all writers should find necessity in all processes, use necessity as the foundation, make contingency the driving force for developing necessity, and construct the work. I think this will surely rationalize the work and concretely express reality.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Essays"</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>It seems that an editor once said: Some articles are difficult to distinguish whether they are novels, essays, or notes, but as long as they have content and are well-written, this situation will still not hinder their greatness.</p>
<p>That's right, this still does not hinder their greatness.</p>
<p>However, if we can distinguish them clearly, thinking that this is an essay, that is a note, and that is a novel, and still not hinder their greatness, that would naturally be even better. But there seem to be not many people doing this kind of "better" work. If there are any, it should start with Mr. Lin Xijun.</p>
<p>Until the recent "Random Notes in Cold Night" in the "Literary Pictorial," Mr. Lin himself does not consider himself "a member of the essayist crowd," but he also writes essays. However, in his essays, one says: "Essays that are hardly considered literary creation"; the principle says: "Trivial and non-genuine literary works of essays"; and three says: "If strictly limited, most of them cannot be accommodated within the realm of literary works. At most, they are just tools used by general essayists to scold people for their own pleasure and have no value."</p>
<p>That's right, essays are tools, and these tools are really powerful. They are taken in Mr. Lin's hands, and he has already scolded himself several times. This time, he simply exiled himself outside the "realm of literary works."</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mr. Lin's "strict limitation" is limited to "most" of them.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, we have no way of knowing how strict Mr. Lin's limitation is. The subject matter of essays is indeed very broad. They also deal with literature, talk about science, discuss society, and satirize politics. If we think that they should be driven out of the "realm of literary works" because of this, then novels, poems, and dramas that draw on society, politics, and science will also be untenable. Only things that specifically describe the lives of literary artists are worthy of being inside the "realm of literary works."</p>
<p>In this way, strict is indeed strict, and Mr. Lin is sitting high in the "realm of literary works," and he is about to sing the "empty city ploy."</p>
<p>If what is limited is the genre, essays are indeed not like novels, poems, and dramas, but they are also not like other papers and narratives in various subjects. This is because they are essays. Since a little can be considered literary works, then most of them are no problem. Because in terms of genre, they are all essays, they are the same.</p>
<p>If it is said to be the style of writing or layout, then there is even less of a problem. The style of writing and layout of essays, like novels, poems, and dramas, vary from person to person. Therefore, there are straight, there are smooth, there are curved, and there are "nonsense."</p>
<p>So what exactly did Mr. Lin see that he expelled essays from the "realm of literary works"? The answer is: This is what he himself said, "completely belongs to a kind of arbitrariness."</p>
<p>If we want to classify essays into or expel them from a certain subject, this is something that requires careful analysis. We really dare not ask him to think calmly about a character like Mr. Lin who has already "lost his soul" when he mentions essays.</p>
<h3>Trivial Talks on Historical Vignettes (3)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Historical vignettes, in terms of technique, are not much different from humorous vignettes and scientific vignettes. Historical vignettes take materials from historical events, and like humorous vignettes taking materials from humorous stories and scientific vignettes taking materials from natural vignettes, they focus on a certain object. Historical events are so rich that it can be said that it is easy to find subjects; however, the historical events in historical collections are often submerged by the weeds of traditional thought; it is an extremely difficult task to extract the true appearance of history from under the weeds and escape from the vulgar historical view and cultivate the "historical eye" for finding subjects. When we start writing historical vignettes, although we cannot, like general historians, devote all our energy and time to sorting out historical materials, basic work is essential. Discussing history from history, the so-called historical event itself is one thing, and the historical event under the historian's pen is another thing; the historical event itself cannot be repeated or seen again, we can only rely on the historical texts under the historian's pen to speculate on the historical event itself. Here, we must first examine three things; first, examine under what circumstances the historian observed this historical event? Second, examine under what circumstances the historian wrote the historical text? Third, examine under what circumstances this historical text was passed down after it was written? We must have twelve points of patience to trace it back, so that the historical event we grasp is not too far from the true appearance of the historical event. The characters and events of history have been criticized by others using their own moral concepts and power relationships; red faces are loyal ministers, painted faces are treacherous villains, and they are solidified into a stereotyped public opinion. We must have new knowledge of social science and historical philosophy to re-establish the standard of knowing people and discussing the world, so that we can get rid of the ideological constraints of our predecessors, so that we can describe his love of women and rough business character under the stereotype of Guan Yunchang, who is publicly recognized as a saint who does not love beauty or fame and fortune. In the past, those who did historical arguments also had the habit of making revisionist articles. Their observation was not correct, which was similar to the dwarfs watching a drama and discussing it along with the crowd; we must have the magnanimous demeanor of historians, let historical materials guide us to the final conclusion, so that we can avoid the drawbacks of "loving novelty" and "drawing conclusions hastily."</p>
<p>In general, the giants in history, the higher their position, the more they become the target of arrows for ordinary people, and the more they are covered by the added moral coats; artists dare not openly challenge society, and their pens are deterred by traditional sayings, and they dare not have their own original ideas. For example, the chapter on appearance in "A New Account of Tales of the World" records the event of Wen Zhongwu and Yu Wenkang投陶侃. It can be written as a fun drama of literati fearing warriors; however, everyone has the shadow of stories such as Tao Kan moving bricks in their minds, and they definitely dare not write this military閥 (Tao Kan) of the Jingzhou system as a warrior's demeanor, and they definitely dare not intersperse the story of the Jingzhou system military閥 and the Yanghzou system military閥 (Su Jun) competing for power. Another example is that in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the storytelling master Liu Jingting was good at elaborating on historical events, and was respected by famous officials and adults at that time for his "ability to directly advise and satirize." However, according to the "Peach Blossom Fan," he said that the paragraph of Confucius' disciple Zhi適齊 in the Analects still does not escape the sour truth of the high-sounding chapters of the Confucian scholars, and it is not seen to be so brilliant, which shows the difficulty of removing traditional ideas. Occasionally I saw a small songbook on the beach, in which the lecture on Confucius going to Ji章 was vivid and interesting, which was a cut above Liu Jingting. I dare to say a sentence now: Those who write historical vignettes should also have the spirit of doubting the ancients and rejecting Confucius first.</p>
<h3>The Drunkard</h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>Tai Laoer swaggered out of the threshold of the Zuileju tavern, humming "Si Lang Visits His Mother." His stomach was full of wine, and he staggered, as if he were about to fall. But just as he was about to go home, he suddenly heard in his ear:</p>
<p>"Laoer, go back quickly, your wife..."</p>
<p>He turned his head to look, and it turned out that the speaker was Pockmarked A-wu.</p>
<p>"Never mind her!"</p>
<p>He shook his head and went his way as usual, thinking in his heart:</p>
<p>"Is my woman really with someone else?"</p>
<p>Every time Tai Laoer had a drink in Zuileju, someone would say this to him, but he never paid attention to it. He always smiled at them and said repeatedly:</p>
<p>"Eh, eh, eh... never mind her!"</p>
<p>After getting drunk, he would go home and sleep; when he woke up, he would have completely forgotten what others had said. Tai Laoer and his wife had always been harmonious, and they even had a son last year. No jokes had ever been made about this son in the Zuileju tavern. One day, the barber Zhang Fu, also full of wine, said with a grin:</p>
<p>"Tai Laoer, is that son really yours?"</p>
<p>"Never mind her!"</p>
<p>"You still don't care even if your wife has a son with someone else?"</p>
<p>"Never mind her."</p>
<p>Tai Laoer continued to drink his wine.</p>
<p>When he was drunk, he did not believe their rumors, but today, he heard Pockmarked A-wu's words again. Although he kept saying "never mind her," he was really unhappy in his stomach. He thought these people were too hateful. Why did they always say these things? Were they joking or was it true?</p>
<p>He staggered along.</p>
<p>"Women, being young, are bound to do things..."</p>
<p>For some reason, he suddenly thought of this, and felt that he was right, so he was angry.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Tell me quickly, are you just hiding it from me?"</p>
<p>"Tell you what!"</p>
<p>"Still pretending to be stupid?"</p>
<p>"You want to die! Why are you acting crazy!"</p>
<p>"Hey, today I will..."</p>
<p>Tai Laoer picked up a teacup and threw it, but he missed, and it shattered on the ground with a "bang."</p>
<p>"I want you to die, you son of a bitch!"</p>
<p>He continued to walk staggeringly, approached her, grabbed her hair and beat her.</p>
<p>His wife cried.</p>
<p>Tai Laoer had vented his anger and ran into the room to sleep. When he woke up, he heard his wife sobbing, and only then did he remember that he had beaten her just now. He thought that his wife was an honest woman who had always treated him well. How could she do such a dirty thing! The words of outsiders were just jokes, how could he have mistakenly beaten his wife in a drunken state. Thinking like this, he really felt extremely uneasy...</p>
<p>The next day, when he went to the Zuileju tavern, he heard others talking about the news of "Tai Laoer beating his wife."</p>

<h3>Towards Evening (5)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The Da Han Company is a storefront with three large bays and a balcony. On the left and right sides are display windows with very large glass panes. Overdue fabrics are placed messily in the windows. The colors of those fabrics are either excessively green or excessively red; they are all simple original colors, with no mixed colors or overprinting. The patterns on the fabrics are also mostly round flowers or circling dragons. There are absolutely no three-dimensional patterns -- truly preserving the medieval atmosphere of a "rural city." But in front of these fabrics, many flood relief lottery tickets are hung askew: (Each window has a hundred or so tickets hanging.) Proudly fluttering in the evening wind.</p>
<p>A large lampshade hangs over the door of the Da Han Company. The sunlight-like light illuminates a large horizontal strip of gray-black water stains on the cement wall. Like a large iron hoop, it embraces this large foreign-style building around the waist, as if it feared that too many buyers would squeeze into this large foreign-style building and it would explode. But at this moment, besides a few clerks who embellish it like ghosts, there is nothing in the large foreign-style building. Even the sound of talking is silent. It is truly as empty as a grave!</p>
<p>The two people then each exhaled a cold breath. Afterward, a burst of sweat broke out on their bodies.</p>
<p>"Oh! It's hot!" The shorter one turned around, looking directly at the opposite side of the road.</p>
<p>"Yes!" The taller one also turned around, looking to the left and right of the road.</p>
<p>"Isn't this it? Isn't this it?" Suddenly the shorter one shouted, pointing to the one diagonally opposite Xinsheng Road, with a wide green overhanging eave, that storefront. "Isn't it written on this -- on the horizontal strip of this eave, 'Chunyang Inn'?"</p>
<p>"Exactly -- " The taller one was a little unhappy that his companion would actually have this clever discovery. "Exactly -- In Japan, it's not so difficult to find. They don't even install a big electric light on the door platform. It's not at all that. That -- when I was in Japan..."</p>
<p>The two people rushed across the road.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yan Xinquan)</p>
<p>Young writer WW, before he got married, once said to me very seriously: "Women are just a man's plaything." But now that he has married a modern wife, not only can he not treat her as a plaything, but he has become a "slave to the dressing table!"</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Wang is already fifty-one years old this year. Although she has given birth to two sons, she has hardly enjoyed a day of happiness from her sons; once, she said to the neighbors in resentment: "I am just a nanny for them in their infancy, a caregiver in their childhood, now that I am old, in their eyes, I am afraid they regard me as a bulky and superfluous object."</p>
<h3>Short Manuscript, Short Talk</h3>
<p>— Zhen Lu</p>
<p>This newspaper recently published "New Rules for Submissions," the first of which states: "The shorter the manuscript, the better," opening the chapter and clarifying the meaning, showing people the norm: this is probably a trendy eyebrow style, not hesitating to give it to people with a smile, no need to ask the husband in a low voice, right? Regarding short manuscripts, a discussion can be had.</p>
<p>Civilization advances and human affairs become complicated, and complication leads to simplification, like heat thinking of coolness, which is bound to happen. In the past, when people met, there was usually a series of pleasantries before getting down to business, and it was considered virtuous to elaborate with long talks. Now, they get straight to the point, like a single knife straight in; from this saying of length and short, one can glimpse the trend of world change. Writing uses language to record, and the principle is the same -- readers want to shorten their time by asking for essences, and writers should provide condensed writing. Even the novel, which is most centered on interest, used to be mostly long, but now short ones are also popular, which can be generalized to the rest. Therefore, adapting to the times, short articles have become the beloved of the heavens, which is certainly not accidental.</p>
<p>Fourteen or fifteen years ago, I once created the smallest newspaper, called: "The Smallest Newspaper," and at the same time, Shoujuan wrote the smallest magazine, called: "Purple Orchid Petal," both advocating short poems, which became a trend; essays, novels, and plays were all prefixed with the terms "shortest" or "smallest," like clouds rising and mists steaming. "The youngest boy under the purple orchid mother," leaving a beautiful story in the publishing industry.</p>
<p>I have a novel titled "Universe," the entire piece is a question mark (?); Hu Huaichenjun continued to use the previous title, completing the piece with an exclamation mark (!), this Xu does not write a single word, which can be said to be the shortest manuscript!</p>
<p>Those who praise short poems often say: "Short, small, refined, and valiant," which does not seem quite appropriate; I think: "Refined, sharp, elegant, and eternal," is perhaps closer to the mark. The writing is refined, the reasoning must be sharp, the language is witty and meaningful, and the taste is endless, these four are all possessed, and the ability of short essays and all short manuscripts is complete!</p>
<h3>Visiting Plum Blossoms on Lonely Hill</h3>
<p>— Ji Chengxing</p>
<p>My foot ailment has just healed, so I invited Mr. Li to visit plum blossoms on Lonely Hill.</p>
<p>Ah, the purity and loveliness of the plum forest, the fragrant aroma that penetrates our hearts, immediately reminds me of the famous line of Lin Chushi: "Sparse shadows slant across the clear water, a faint fragrance floats in the twilight," it is a pity that this is not twilight, if there were a hazy moon, how much more poetic would it be!</p>
<p>Slowly climbing the steps, we rested briefly at the Crane Releasing Pavilion, and then went to visit Lin Chushi's tomb. The plum blossoms here are blooming just right, and there are also many buds waiting to bloom. Because someone is taking care of it, the scenery here is no longer as desolate as it used to be. It is a pity that the plum blossoms have no confidant, and what expression do the tourists have besides superficial praise! Even the poets and celebrities, who would treat them as wives! They only take the unbearably vulgar modern girls here to wander around. If Lin Chushi's heroic soul saw it, I'm afraid he would vomit for three days!</p>
<p>Because my right foot felt sore, after appreciating the plum forest beside the Crane Releasing Pavilion, I had to bid farewell abruptly. Because I was too fond of the plum blossoms, I broke off a branch to take home.</p>
<p>If it were visiting plum blossoms in the snow, how much more fun would it be!</p>
<h3>Those Who Are Doomed in the Struggle for Survival</h3>
<p>— Tong Fu</p>
<h3>Cats and Dogs Infected with the Smoking Habit</h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>My friend, the owner of Shuangqin Hall, keeps a cat, which is extremely gorgeous, and he cherishes it no differently from an invaluable treasure. The hall owner has a hibiscus habit, and whenever he lies down on a couch, he puts it in his arms and strokes it casually for pleasure. As a result, the cat has become a habit, and as soon as it sees its owner lighting a smoking lamp and bending over to lie down, it jumps onto the bed, squats between its owner's elbows and arms, moves its nose, and smells the thick smoke spewing out, as if it were stereotyped, without a day's or space between. One day, the hall owner was occupied with other matters, and when it was time for the owner to smoke as usual, this cat could not smell the smoke, and the craving broke out. It paced back and forth on the owner's couch, making miserable cries, and yawning repeatedly, with tears and saliva dripping down. The mistress saw it and could not bear it, so she quickly set up the smoking tools and imitated what her husband did, and after a while, it was over.</p>
<p>Recently, a Zhuyou doctor came to our town, carrying two pug dogs, one large and one small; he always takes them with him when he goes to the "smoke selling station" to smoke every day. While he is bending over to burn the smoke, these two dogs are very quiet and curl up beside him, without moving. When he has sucked a mouthful of smoke and drank a mouthful of tea, the larger one immediately goes over and receives the remaining smoke in his mouth, mouth to mouth, and licks his tongue into his mouth, swaying left and right, making a clicking sound. It seems that he does this several times in a row, and then lets the smaller dog do the same work; the large one comes first and then the small one, which is very orderly and has never been argued over. According to the doctor, the smaller dog was originally born to the larger one, and had already contracted a smoking habit in the mother's womb; therefore, since it was born, it has had to be sprayed with smoke several times a day, so that it has become even more addicted than the mother dog.</p>
<p>From this point of view, opium, a kind of thing, not only causes harm to our nation, but also poisons the animal kingdom!</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Ueno Zoo in Japan (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The pythons of the Malay Peninsula are twenty to thirty feet long, and the Hokkaido bears weigh over a hundred pounds. As for the rest, like pangolins and lizards, there are four or five types of each, with detailed descriptions provided.</p>
<p>The center of the zoo is where the fiercest beasts reside, surrounded by thick iron bars. Inside are three lions and three tigers, as well as leopards and wolves. When a lion roars, all the glass windows in the house rattle, truly befitting the king of beasts. Next to each animal's dwelling is a large open space for them to roam. They frolic in the warm valleys. The long-necked giraffe is a specialty of Africa. Its residence is two stories high, yet still not very comfortable, which demonstrates how long its neck is.</p>
<p>The place of origin is described for each animal. Those found in Japan are mostly collected by themselves. Some are purchased from India, the Malay Peninsula, Australia, and South America. There are not many products from our country, only a very beautiful leopard and the mules commonly seen in Beiping. There are many products from Manchuria and Korea, presumably to show goodwill.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Failing to Flatter and Suffering Rebukes When Seeking Help, Failing to Return Home and Being Misled by Exaggerated Praise</p>
<p>When Yueying heard this, she knew that there was no room for negotiation. What was she waiting for in this room? So, she pouted and said to Madam Hu, "Let's go." Madam Hu could understand very little, but at least understood the words "go" and "scram". She had never worked as a servant for anyone, yet she was being told to scram. There was no need to ask why, as the job was clearly not worth doing. Now that her daughter was helping her up, she also became indignant and excited, and walked out, supporting herself on the door frame. Yueying followed her out of the small courtyard gate, grumbling, "This is my fault. If I had known, I would have gone back earlier. Why did I cry in the yard, feeling scared and cold?" Madam Hu was even more useless than her daughter, having been scolded, and had nothing to say but to raise her sleeves and wipe her tears. By this time, the back door of Little Western Paradise had long been closed, and the mother and daughter groped their way through several layers of rooms, and had no choice but to exit through the main gate. As they walked to the second main building, a large kerosene lamp hung from the roof beam, its flame burning with a whooshing sound, its light as white as silver, so bright that even a fallen needle could be seen. On both sides of the passage were many reclining chairs and tea tables. Tea and cigarettes were placed on the tea tables. Some people reclined in the chairs with their legs crossed, chatting idly. Some people were gathered around a tea table, playing chess. Some people picked up newspapers and read under the lamp. Although not everyone had a smile on their face, no one looked like they were about to cry. When Yueying saw this, she thought to herself, this is something I don't understand. Why are people all eating and dressing, and very happy, while why am I so miserable? She was looking at many people blankly like this when a woman came down the stairs across from them, wearing a light green top and a blue skirt. (140)</p>
<h3>Records of Fragrant Imperial Clouds</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, what she told us was mostly the same old stories that she had told us before, and we had to pretend to listen with an air of having never heard them before.</p>
<p>"Actors are said to be very devout believers in gods and Buddhas!" Today, she actually told a story that was somewhat new. "Especially towards Guan Gong, who is known as the Demon-Subduing Great Emperor, they are particularly respectful and devout. No matter how cheerful and talkative a person is, as long as it's their turn to play Guan Gong today, they will immediately become solemn. They must first buy a statue of Guan Gong and his horse, carefully fold it, place it high on the table, light incense and candles, and sincerely kowtow. Then they pick it up and carefully tuck it into their own bosom until the play is over. Only then do they take it out, put it back on the table, kowtow again, and finally put it on paper and burn it. Only after going through this whole process can they feel at ease, otherwise they will be uneasy and think that a great disaster is about to befall them."</p>
<p>"Actors are also the most conservative!" The Empress Dowager continued to describe the lives of actors to us. "Every move, every line in the play, the patterns on the costumes, the ornaments they wear, are all regarded as golden rules and laws that must be strictly followed, and they will never change. Not only do they do this for their entire lives, but their descendants and apprentices will continue to do the same!"</p>
<p>These two paragraphs can be said to be extremely pertinent, and I later heard others say the same thing.</p>
<p>I think the literary scenes of old Chinese dramas are still a very beautiful form of opera; as for the martial scenes, they are a bit too lively! Whenever it comes to battles between two armies, the gongs and drums are so loud that they almost deafen people; and the kind of reckless fighting is also too wild, and I don't like to watch it.

<p>Interesting Scientific Facts</p>
<p>Human sense of smell is too poor. If you have ever hunted, when you see a hunting dog moving forward, frantically wagging its nose in the rocks and weeds, can you imagine what it is sensing? I think not only you, but anyone in the world cannot imagine it, simply because the human sense of smell is too poor. Although humans are not weaker than all animals in their sense of smell, compared with the good smellers among mammals, the difference is simply astronomical. If you don't believe it, please look at the interesting experiments recently conducted by Professor Mai Tehai on this issue: A guinea pig (a guinea pig is also one of the mammals with a good sense of smell) has been accustomed to eating barley porridge since childhood. One day, a small amount of arsenic was added to the porridge. It ate it very happily at the time, and as a result, it was poisoned, and for several days it did not dare to approach the barley porridge. Now, in addition to arsenic, it was also given a plate of barley porridge containing nitrified alum (with an almond-like smell) (porridge 50 cm, nitrified alum 80 drops). After a short period of identification, it only ate the latter because the latter had an unusual smell, but it did not have a bad image. After only one day of experience, it had imprinted the fact that only barley porridge with the smell of nitrified alum is "you can eat". From then on, the two types of barley porridge were given at the same time, and the amount of nitrified alum contained in one of them was gradually reduced, from 1:10, 1:100 to 1:10000000. At that time, the guinea pig could still distinguish its smell, and thought it was edible. If it was diluted further, it would no longer be able to feel the existence of nitrified alum, so it hesitated not to eat both. Later, Mr. Mai ordered ten of his top students to do the experiment, giving them as many plates of barley porridge as they did the guinea pig experiment, with the same amount of porridge and nitrified alum, and asked each student to individually record the plate number in which they could still identify the existence of nitrified alum. The result was that they could no longer smell its existence at all when the nitrified alum was diluted to more than 1:100000. From this, it can be seen that the human sense of smell is actually thousands of times worse than that of a guinea pig. That is, a spice that a human can only just feel the aroma of only needs to be one-thousandth of its quantity in a guinea pig, and it can feel the same aroma. What an amazing thing this is!</p>
<p>Scientific Production of Medicine from the Placenta The placenta, or afterbirth, is the membrane that encloses the fetus. The fetus obtains nutrition from the mother and excretes metabolic products through it. Therefore, it is a meritorious servant in the developmental history of every person. However, people who have not received medical knowledge will at least feel uncomfortable when they hear the word "placenta." Even women themselves regard it as an unclean thing. However, almost everything exists. The ancient Chinese medicine, which includes everything, probably recognizes it as a wonderful medicine for calming the mind, nourishing qi, replenishing blood, and benefiting essence (that is, the so-called purple river cart.) Even the "doctor" himself does not know how to calm the mind. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Decoration</h3>
<p>— Chen San</p>
<p>A piece of lard cake worth three copper coins is placed in a brocade box and displayed in a large glass cabinet. Someone without experience will be stunned and wonder which country this piece of lard cake comes from? Is it a scientifically baked product? Or was a "special technician" hired? The reason is that the decoration is too "luxurious". It makes the piece of lard cake worth three copper coins look "dignified".</p>
<p>A friend who works as a clerk in a cosmetics company told me that the eyes of men and women in the city are born to only pay attention to decoration. When I asked him the reason, he gave me facts to prove it: A lady with her head shrunk in a gray overcoat collar came to buy a bottle of perfume. Even when the best one was given to her, she still shook her head. There was no other way but to put the original product in a Paris glass bottle in the warehouse and double the price. The lady put her nose up to sniff it and praised it as a valuable product. She paid the full price and bought it. In fact, she didn't buy perfume, she bought the Paris glass bottle—decoration.</p>
<p>However, it is not only goods that need decoration to be valuable. In this world where "clothes are valued more than people," people must also pay attention to their "appearance." According to the original meaning of "Buddhas need gold clothes, people need fine clothes," a bamboo cloth robe doesn't seem to make much of an impression. At a banquet, other distinguished guests might mistake you for a servant, and even the host will consider it not very honorable. Moreover, if you want to go up to the seventh floor, the elevator operator will tell you without waiting for you to order: "Run up the escalator yourself!" Oh my god, if you have a beautiful set of clothes on your body, a cigar in your mouth, and a leather bag in your hand... then how comfortable you would be. Pull the iron door, open the iron door, and make people look up to you.</p>
<p>Some honest people will show their honest eyes and accuse this of being "vanity".</p>
<p>However, in this world, "vanity" is somewhat beneficial to life. Lard cake is sold in brocade boxes, so people should pay more attention to their outward "selling point." For example, even if you have not read any foreign languages, you can put a large vacuum tube fountain pen in your pocket. Even if your eyes are not sick, wearing a pair of flat-lens doctorate glasses is enough to add color to your face. Is the world not full of idiots who pursue practicality? Don't think that you can go out and respond to the world just because you have a stomach full of skills. You must first stand in front of the dressing mirror and look at yourself. If you want to make a living in society, I advise you to talk less about practicality. Otherwise, everyone else is eating rice, and you don't even have a bowl of thin porridge to hold.</p>
<p>Or, you will complain again and curse those people who don't know what's good. But how many people in the world really know what's good? In the bathhouse, who doesn't have a naked body? Does Mr. Zhang have any less body parts than Mr. Li? However, one comes out wearing a blue cloth short jacket and trousers, and the other comes out wearing a fur coat. The difference in shape and color is immediately apparent. Of course, this is the difference in "decoration" between the two people. But, you say, which one will people recognize as "upper class"?</p>
<p>Naturally, the one wearing blue cloth short jacket and trousers is the one who was eliminated in the first round. You can't blame people for not knowing what's good, he himself lacks "decoration." It is the same example as the three-copper-coin lard cake that is not packed in a brocade box.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Rural Life</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>The most miscellaneous thing is the air that is quiet to the point of being unable to be quieter. This mood, this environment, is most suitable for a person who has long been accustomed to urban life and finally feels disgusted with the noisy atmosphere to take a spiritual rest. Here, there is absolutely no day and night shouting that will cause you to have inexplicable annoyance, which is unique to cities with various vehicles and horses. What there is is a clear blue sky, and the clouds leisurely soaring in the sky above. In addition, there are occasionally one or two train whistles passing from distant villages. But when this sound enters your ears, it has become very soft and long. It will definitely not cause you any discomfort, perhaps it is a rare melody that decorates this too-silent natural world. If you have just slipped out of the high-speed city that is constantly spinning with material machinery, and thrown yourself into the gentle and peaceful embrace of nature, you will deeply feel how vulgar and dark everything in the city is. How refreshing and lively everything in the village is, and at the same time feel as if you have taken off a heavy burden, and there is unspeakable comfort.</p>
<p>The lives of all the people here are healthy and full of energy. Completely unlike the city, where there is no distinction between day and night, and people often sleep until dusk, and they can't see the face of the sun all year round, making everyone's face sickly yellow and gray, without a trace of color. A day's life for the people here is almost equivalent to two days for city people. Their work is more regular: when the sun rises, they begin to work with their hands and feet; when the sun sets, the whole day's work is done, and they rest, have a full stomach, and then each go to find their own fun.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, bathed in the faint morning glow, taking slow steps, walking step by step towards the fields, gentle breezes blowing slowly from the front, closing your lips and taking a deep breath, a new and lively feeling immediately overflows the whole body, and the mind feels unusually relaxed and happy at the same time. And constantly stumbling your feet, with a bit of coolness, are the green grasses containing crystal-like dew, and as you brush past them, they fall to the ground in drops. Maybe there are also small birds singing a morning serenade in the nearby leaves.</p>
<p>Continuing along the way, what you will see is three or five women walking slowly on the ridges, leading children on one side and taking some dirty clothes to the pond to wash on the other side; in the fields far and near, scattered farmers are wriggling and hunching their arms to pull out weeds, and some are pushing ox plows, turning the soil, while scolding the animals and whistling at the same time.</p>
<p>If the spring plowing comes, they will become more busy and cannot be separated. As soon as the sky is bright, they all climb down, take various tools such as hoes and shovels and rush to their own fields. Even the young children who usually just eat white rice and play follow their fathers to help. The whole day is spent in the field. At noon, the housekeepers cook and send meals to them. Sometimes even the housekeepers are busy, so they simply change things like sweet potatoes for rice. They go home only from early morning until the dim sunset in the west. They never think of being lazy, and everyone asks each other.</p>
<p>——Brother Da Mu, your field will soon be plowed, right!</p>
<p>——Rice can be planted in a few days.</p>
<p>Hearing this answer, the questioner will unconsciously feel anxious:</p>
<p>—You have a lot of people, it's really comfortable. Like me, with only one horse, I have to do everything myself. Fortunately, God is good, it hasn't rained for several days. If it rains at this time, wouldn't even the seedlings be unable to be sown? That would be terrible?</p>
<p>The tone is mixed with extreme urgency.</p>
<p>But this seems to be the scenery that exists in my memory. Now that I live in this village again, it is not easy to see the farmers working diligently in the fields as before. Although the tranquility and quietness here are still the same, and the noise and prosperity of the city are also still the same, some things have changed.</p>
<h3>Work After Obtaining a Title</h3>
<p>— Ding Mo</p>
<h3>Uncle</h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>My mother sent a telegram from home, asking me to quickly pack up and go home, because my uncle's illness was getting worse day by day. According to the doctor, the condition is very serious, and there is probably no hope of recovery. Therefore, we have to prepare to take care of my uncle's funeral affairs, and ask me to go back quickly to help.</p>
<p>It has been a whole six years since I last went to my uncle's house. However, my uncle's life's work and his appearance are still very clearly imprinted in my mind—he is about forty years old, with a medium-sized, thin body, a small head, with a few sparse and messy gray hair, a dark and dry yellowish face, really too thin, without a bit of luster or fullness, simply like a wax figure in a specimen room! His two eyes are deeply sunken like two holes, but the two black pupils are like stars shining in the night sky.</p>
<p>The air in the room was as dead as midnight. At the window, I lowered my head and thought for a while, feeling thousands of melancholy insects squirming in my heart, occupying my whole heart. So, so, I raised my head and looked at the light clouds floating across the blue sky outside the window, light and lonely. At this time, my uncle's house six years ago quickly appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>When my mother was not yet married, my grandfather had died of rheumatism in Nanyang. At that time, my uncle was still young. Because my grandmother only gave birth to my uncle as a son, she would not let my uncle go far away to the "foreign country" to inherit his father's business. At the same time, my uncle was also a gentle and weak scholar who was not used to doing business. It goes without</p>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>saying that he was an amateur. Therefore, he was happy to enjoy the industry left by his grandfather at home, living a leisurely and elegant life.</p>
<p>I have liked going to my uncle's house since I was a child, because my uncle's study raised many kinds of birds: such as the jumping and singing orioles and thrushes, and even pigeons that can deliver letters, which are the most able to amuse me and make me reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>"Nephew Yun, that gray-winged, hawk-eyed pigeon has laid an egg, so white and big, so cute." Every time I went to my uncle's house, when I met my uncle, he would always tell me with a childlike smile.</p>
<p>"Uncle, just let me raise two little pigeons that look like gray-winged, hawk-eyed." I leaned close to my uncle and squealed, insisting on him promising me, until my uncle nodded.</p>
<p>Time passed like flowing water, without any mercy, and I have not been to my uncle's house for a whole six years. Although I have to return home every year, the shortness of the holidays has made it impossible for me to see my uncle again. But in my mother's letters, I can always learn a little bit about my uncle's situation over the years, knowing about the decline of his family and the desolation of his old age. However, this is just a little bit of my uncle's situation that I have seen in the letters from home.</p>
<p>That day, I took the noon train to leave City T. The next day in the afternoon, my uncle's house appeared before my eyes. The tall white powder walls were not as white as they were six years ago, and they were peeling off in patches. The black lacquered gate had also faded, and the bright golden bronze door knocker was covered with a thick layer of green rust, showing a kind of decadent and down-and-out atmosphere under the slanting sunlight.</p>
<p>When I pushed open the two faded and peeling doors, the green lilac flowers with graceful and charming姿态 that had supported her with a wooden frame stood lonely. Orioles, thrushes, and pigeons, not even a feather was left. Everything was deserted and unexpectedly showed an atmosphere of decline. After walking through the deserted gate lane and entering the central hall, the air suddenly became solemn. My mother and aunt were surrounding my uncle's thin body, crying sadly.</p>
<p>In addition, everything was silent, showing an atmosphere of decline.</p>
<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>They took shelter from the drizzle and slanting wind in a single-front cafe.</p>
<p>When she sat down opposite him, rubbing her hands, the plump, watermelon-like White Russian woman bowed to the patrons with an ugly smile. Without asking for her consent, he ordered two glasses of sweet wine and a plate of milk cake.</p>
<p>It was three o'clock, the quietest time in the cafe. The owner of the shop turned to the back of the counter, and the two unexpected guests sat in the warm-as-spring elegant room.</p>
<p>"I received her letter yesterday morning saying that she had spent two months of married life in the sanatorium. That's funny enough! Escaping from the thermometer and the confinement room of the white-clad girls, watching movies every day for entertainment, hoping that I would come to Cathay today at three o'clock to be her companion."</p>
<p>He wanted to meet her in the wind and rain, but she said she didn't like to watch the movie starring Butterfly Madame, so she came here to take shelter from the rain for no reason.</p>
<p>She looked in the mirror and arranged her hair that was messed up by the wind, saying as if to herself: "I've really gained weight lately!"</p>
<p>"I also want to go to the sanatorium, I'm too thin!"</p>
<p>I didn't want such a casual remark to cause her dissatisfaction. Do you think it's okay to do that? "A living person being a prisoner of the thermometer!"</p>
<p>The shop owner respectfully delivered the food and retreated to the back of the counter. From her smile when she left, I felt that she was fantasizing about a sweet dream.</p>
<p>"That guy is thinking about being a duchess!"</p>
<p>"You've really changed! Don't you have any sympathy for a weak woman stranded in a foreign country!"</p>
<p>She raised her glass, put it down without touching a drop of green liquid, and looked all over him with her eyes, making him afraid to look at her, as if she was going to do a deed of heroism admired by thousands of people today.</p>
<p>"Two months seem to have passed for three years..." She shook her head and swallowed the meaning underneath along with the wine.</p>
<p>He couldn't answer any more. In fact, there was nothing to say. Looking at the rows of foreign wine bottles in the cabinet, he suddenly thought that if that fat guy straightened his back and stood in front, he couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>"It's really worth your laugh, spending your honeymoon in the sanatorium!"</p>
<p>As if after the rain, everything was exposed from the dark clouds. Women are so thoughtful and far-sighted. "Miss, you misunderstood my meaning. Do you think I can still bring a bouquet of flowers to your bedside every day to greet you? You also have to have some sympathy for a hero who has returned defeated from the battlefield!" He angrily finished the wine in front of him.</p>
<p>"Hmph! That rogue! He sent me to the hospital but ran away! Don't you know?"</p>
<p>He almost wanted to laugh again.</p>
<p>"Yes, the newspaper told me that he failed to make a fortune; but in another occasion, he did not declare failure!"</p>
<p>She showed a sincere smile, this smile evoked the emotions he had long forgotten. He felt himself gradually great. If he stood in front of the foreign wine bottle cabinet, he could win victory from the duchess. To celebrate her completion of the work of heroism, he raised his glass, but it was an empty glass.</p>
<p>The moment he left the cafe, the people who had just left the three o'clock movie came in. The sky stopped raining, and the slanting wind brushed against his face, and he felt a slight breath of spring. Walking past the gate of Cathay again, he looked at the advertisement picture of Shirby Schneidemei and said to her:</p>
<p>"Are you going to the US Consulate to ask when the cherry blossoms will bloom again?"</p>
<p>"How annoying! I don't like watching her movies!"</p>

<h3>"David Copperfield" Made into a Film</h3>
<p>— Xiying</p>
<p>Detailed Research Striving for Perfection</p>
<p>Characters in the Play Fit the Original Scenery</p>
<p>Dickens' famous novel, "David Copperfield," has now been brought to the screen. When the film is released in Shanghai in the future, we can see the scenery and characters of Dickens' era in the eighteenth century, because the production of "David Copperfield" is meticulously researched, even in the smallest details, and there are no flaws to be found. Those who have read Dickens' original book or Lin Qinnan's translation must have an image of all the characters in the book in their minds, their appearance, speech, and actions. After they see "David Copperfield" on the screen, they will definitely clap their hands and applaud, because the appearance, speech, and actions of all the characters on the screen can be said to coincide with what they imagined in their minds.</p>
<p>Let us temporarily put aside the configuration of all the characters in the play and first talk about the preparations for the filming of this film.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, David Selznick, the young producer who created the amazing success of "Little Women," began to look for material that could be compared to "Little Women." At that time, the director of "Little Women," George Cukor, also sympathized with him. There was also a writer, Howard Estabrook, the author of "Cimarron," who was also very enthusiastic. So the three of them joined forces and sought out excellent material together.</p>
<p>The subsequent events cannot be described in detail here. In short, in November 1933, after they had decided to adopt Dickens' "David Copperfield," in order to make the atmosphere in the film realistic, they found several first editions of Dickens' novels, because in those books, there were portraits of characters hand-painted by the artist Phiz of Dickens' era. They used those portraits as blueprints for filming, because those portraits had been personally selected by Dickens himself, who believed that they were exactly like the people in his book. In addition, there were also pen drawings by Hablot Knight Browne, which were adopted after Phiz's suicide, and were also used as a reference. These drawings were reprinted many times as reference materials for the authorities. This is why the characters on the screen coincide with what readers of Dickens' novels imagine in their minds.</p>
<p>The meticulous research of their staff is not limited to the appearance of the characters. They also sent photographers to London to photograph everything related to the eighteenth century, regardless of size. As a result, they took as many as 70,000 photos, including the style of the eighteenth-century stocks, as well as the wallpaper on the walls, locks and keys, fabrics, etc. It was truly all-encompassing and meticulous. These many photos were shipped back to the United States and became the basis for the MGM scenery department to arrange the furnishings and utensils.</p>
<p>In London, they also found a tailor shop that specializes in making eighteenth-century clothing for stage performances. They found this tailor shop and received a lot of help, because that tailor shop also had a history of everything. They had paintings and photographs of various eighteenth-century clothing. They found this tailor shop and commissioned them to make clothes and accessories for all the roles in "David Copperfield." In this way, the style of the clothes in "David Copperfield" can be said to be very well-founded.</p>
<p>In June 1934, Cukor, Estabrook, and Selznick felt that this was not enough and that they had to go and inspect it themselves. So they went to London together to collect customs and customs. They first started from Blunderstone, the birthplace of David Copperfield (the protagonist of the book), and examined it, and then went through Yarmouth, Dover, Canterbury, and other places according to the program in the book. They also met Mr. Hugh Walpole, the vice president of the British Dickens Society, and asked him to help, and persuaded him to go to Hollywood to join the production work and serve as a screenwriter. Walpole also readily agreed and served as the supervisor of the production of "David Copperfield."</p>
<p>The writing of the script was a very difficult task. They wrote it eight times in total, because Dickens' original book was very long, and it was quite a difficult task to shorten it into a film. There were eight people engaged in writing, with Walpole as the main brain, but they all felt helpless from time to time. For example, there were a total of thirty-seven banquets described in Dickens' original book, which one should be used now?</p>
<p>Then, talking about the characters in the play, the film script only used twenty-six important roles, but there were more than three times as many characters in the original book that could be called important. In addition to the important roles, there were at least fifty minor roles that spoke, and it was necessary to find appropriate people. The various difficulties and anecdotes were even more numerous. For example, Chauncey Olcott was chosen to play Micawber in the book. Because Micawber was bald, he shaved his head completely. When he went to the set the next day, the director felt that he didn't look like the poor Micawber, so he replaced him with someone else. He shaved his head for nothing and became a monk.</p>
<h3>Film Reviews</h3>
<h3>Review of "Mr. Wang's Secret"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>— Golden City Screening —</p>
<p>Some people say, "Don't make people cry anymore, Chinese movies need comedies." But movies are not like last year was "Women's National Goods Year" and this year is "Students' National Goods Year," which are so clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>But at this time we saw "Mr. Wang's Secret" after "Mr. Wang." The story of "Mr. Wang's Secret" seems to be more complete than "Mr. Wang." At least there is a story here that is quite connected from beginning to end. If we don't have higher hopes at all, then this story expresses to some extent the universal life and ideas of the petty bourgeoisie. Mr. Wang and Little Chen are indeed a certain type of character in the current city. They represent the vulgar psychology of ordinary citizens. Their philosophy of "there are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest," at the same time, in addition to the wife, they are also very interested in taking concubines. Naturally, this reflects the ugly phenomena of advertising for marriage or calling for help to commit suicide. The playwright happily shouted out the slogan of overthrowing men who insult women, and the dancer's way of life of committing suicide is also satirized by the playwright. However, the dancer's way of life of committing suicide is precisely the tragedy of society. The author with a sense of justice should expose the social pathology from the front, and not just finish it with a satire. To put it more deeply, the entire story has no deep meaning, but it is just a superficial exaggeration of social phenomena, without any essential review, and the degree of exaggeration is almost unreasonable.</p>
<p>Speaking of this aspect, we believe that slapstick movies are by no means unreasonable messing around. Hollywood slapstick films have given us ample proof that that kind of idiotic laughter has little artistic value other than making people laugh. In other words, if slapstick films continue like this forever, it will be inevitable to decline. Reality should also be truly reflected in comedies, and slapstick films should also be the expression of film art. Therefore, writers who are loyal to film art must undoubtedly first strive for artistic gains.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang's Secret" still inevitably contains some shortcomings in terms of performance techniques. The purpose of the playwright or director is to make people laugh, but as a result, because of excessive exaggeration, such as Mr. Wang and Little Chen catching chickens, such as washing clothes, etc., the effect of laughter is destroyed by repeated repetition and unreasonable exaggeration. As for the dancer's suicide, there is also an error in the weaving method, committing the problem of not being able to connect.</p>
<p>Some people say that the advantage of this film is that it does not make people laugh with actions, but the story is funny. Indeed, there is no very rigid slapstick, but the exaggeration of actions is the reason why the work is not successful. All in all, this work is more commendable in Chinese slapstick films, that is, it is not completely messing around with the so-called slapstick face.</p>
<h3>Review of "Evergreen"</h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>"Evergreen" — Cathay Screening</p>
<p>This film begins with a brief narrative of twenty-five years ago as a prelude, writing about the famous name of a song and dance queen, Hallie Green, and the tragedy of her unfortunate marriage. The director's handling of the heroine's glory in success, and the quiet departure of self-sacrifice in the burning of love, are quite successful in terms of psychological expression and the setting of the atmosphere of the drama.</p>
<p>The unfolding of the whole drama is today, twenty-five years later, and the plot is discovered from an unknown young actress, Hallie Hawks. After she was rejected many times for the opportunity to perform in a drama group, she was met by a countess, saying that her appearance was very similar to the red-lipped Hallie Green of the past, and after inquiring about her life in detail, she was introduced to the theater owner as Green's daughter, and at the same time, through a publicist, Tommy, who was suffering from his own anonymity, he promoted her in the newspaper, saying that someone who had disappeared had come back again. So, as the news spread, Hawks learned her mother's song and dance style, put on makeup and performed, and won great success. At the same time, she was also noticed by her mother's lover, Marquis Staines, and her original father, and things started to become entangled from then on.</p>
<p>Naturally, like all films, without exception, there are love scenes, and the protagonists of love at this time are naturally Hallie Hawks and the young publicist, Tommy.</p>
<p>At this time, her father, using the same means as he had used to blackmail her mother in the past, repeatedly blackmailed this young couple. She hated it so much that she exposed this fake incident in one of the performances. So, in the uproar of the audience, and in the trial of the court, the lovers became married.</p>
<p>In such a story, under the appropriate handling of the screenwriter, such as emphasizing the misfortune suffered by the mother and daughter, making a deep criticism and exposure of the men, especially the men who are husbands and fathers, the theater operators, publicists, etc., who do not hesitate to deceive the audience in order to make money and become famous, as well as the audience's worship. Then, the success of this script will naturally not be limited to the ordinary song and dance films like the present.</p>
<p>Judging from the current performance, the success of the screenwriter is far less than that of the director. For example, the events of twenty-five years ago cannot be technically inserted into the progress of the drama, but are cut off and placed at the beginning of the film. The countess's meeting with Hawks in the coincidence of Tommy calling her to wait for the opportunity is also not technical enough.</p>
<p>Director Victor Saville has quite commendable things, such as drinking high heels as champagne glasses, and striking glasses with knives and forks to make a sound, etc., which are satirical of aristocratic gentlemen. The use of cigars in several places shows intelligence. The use of lenses and the weaving of pictures are also quite lively and lively, such as starting to write Green on the successful stage "cut off" to the banquet, Tommy's insertion of cigars in the theater director Ben's mouth "cut off" to his training members with smoke in his mouth. When Green left, she looked at the stage lights of her farewell performance being extinguished one by one in the car, etc., which were clean and profound. The expressions and descriptions of the youthfulness of the two young people, Tommy and Hawks, when they stayed together are also more commendable than those from the comedians.</p>
<p>Among the actors, I think Betty Balfour, who plays the director of the drama group, Ben, is the best. Of course, the key scenes of Kitty McKintosh's Hallie Hawks and Sonny Hale's Tommy cannot be underestimated either.</p>

<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>National Voice (Bordertown) (8)</h3>
<p>— Xue Mei</p>
<p>Mary Rooke indeed reported Johnny Ramirez, saying he was the murderer who forced her to kill her husband. On the day of the trial, it alarmed all parts of the border, and even the Los Angeles newspapers prominently published Johnny Ramirez's name, because by this time, Johnny Ramirez's name was known to many people. Dale Elwell was also one of the social figures who knew Johnny. Johnny had even written a letter to her.</p>
<p>Johnny Ramirez was locked in jail. The jailer came to tell him that someone had come to visit him. Johnny thought it was Dale Elwell, so he jumped up and asked, "A woman—young—very beautiful?" The jailer scolded, "I don't know, go see for yourself." Johnny had no choice but to follow him and walk out of the iron gate. Outside, a woman called his nickname, "Juanito." Indeed, it was a woman, but neither young nor beautiful. It was his mother. She was wearing a large shawl common to Mexican women. The Persian lamb coat, although Johnny had bought it for her long ago, she still couldn't get used to wearing it. Accompanying her was the priest from Sonora. Johnny never thought that his mother was still alive and would come to visit him. His mother hugged him and tremblingly asked, "You didn't commit that crime, did you?" Johnny said, "Mom, I didn't."</p>
<p>In the courtroom, Johnny's mother and the priest sat with him. Johnny looked around, but he couldn't see his sweetheart. After a while, the prosecutor stood up and said, "I request the presiding judge to call the first witness—Mary Rooke." A female prison guard led Mary Rooke in. She was casually dressed, without any makeup. She walked into the witness stand and took the oath. The prosecutor began to question her, "How long had you known the defendant before your husband died?" Mary replied, "Eight months." The prosecutor then asked, "Where did you first meet him?" Mary seemed not to have heard the prosecutor's words. Her eyes stared straight at Johnny. The prosecutor asked again, "I ask you, Mrs. Rooke, where did you first meet the defendant?" She still didn't hear. The whole court was silent, waiting for her answer, but she still stared at Johnny without speaking.</p>
<p>The judge looked at Mary Rooke, finding her expression strange and somewhat suspicious, so he instructed again, "Please answer the question you were asked." Mary seemed to have heard something. She seemed to have struggled to move her eyes away from Johnny. She began to laugh. At first, she laughed softly, then louder and louder, until she was yelling and screaming wildly. In her wild screams, there were also many intermittent sentences, fragmented words: "He's young... he should be alive... fat and big... he's still so fat... I saw it... Johnny told me to look at him... he already told Sam... when I sleep at night..." It was clear that Mary Rooke was insane. The first witness was impossible to examine, and the case could not proceed.</p>
<p>After the case was dismissed, Johnny Ramirez got into his car, crossed a stretch of desert, and arrived in Los Angeles. It was late, but there was still time to see Dale Elwell and tell her of his love. He arrived at the Elwell's house, and the doorman seemed to know his purpose, coldly saying, "Miss Elwell is about to go out." Johnny said, "Oh, she's going out, I'm coming in. Go tell her." As he spoke, he strode in.</p>
<p>At this moment, Dale Elwell was wearing an evening dress, with a coat draped over her shoulders, walking down the stairs. Seeing Johnny come in, she greeted him and said, "Johnny, you're here. Did they give you trouble?" Johnny laughed, "No, no. What bothered me the most was not being able to keep the appointment that day." Dale said, "I also thought about going to court that day, maybe I could give you some spiritual help. But, you know, my family would definitely not allow me to go. What could I do?"</p>
<p>What Dale Elwell said was perhaps not as affectionate as Johnny had expected, but he didn't blame her too much. He said, "Okay, let's go out together—let's go out to eat." Dale said, "Oh, Johnny, I'm so sorry. When you came, I was just about to go out. I'm already half an hour late. I have to go to a formal banquet—you know, at the house of one of our longtime family friends." Johnny said, "That doesn't matter. I'll take you there." (To be continued)</p>
