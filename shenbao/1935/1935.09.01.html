<h3 id="c7">國際戰雲與各國之財政負担 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>最近國際間戰雲的濃密。已達歐戰以來的最高點。在東亞。表面化的局部戰爭雖暫時停止。而太平洋兩岸軍事布置的着着進展。似在準備最後大規模的决鬥。在西歐德國已逕自恢復海陸軍備。英國又宣布七年造艦計劃。同時東非意阿的衝突。使戰雲密佈於紅海地中海一帶。甚至整個歐洲的局面。亦有岌岌可危之勢。今日各國政治家所等待的。似乎不是和平的消息。而是撥動戰弦的第一箭了。然而在國際關係上。究竟以和平爲常則。而戰爭爲變則。戰爭是不祥的東西。它包含着稱種危險的因素。在戰雲瀰漫世界的今日。我們極望各國的執政當局和人民能注意到這些危險因素的發展。在現刻。我們以爲最先値得注意的危險因素。是各國財政負担的加重。將至於於不能支持的限度。</p>
<p>從一九三一年以來日本。則政預算中支出超過於收入的數額。年約九萬萬元。軍費常佔全部預算的半數。在本年度的預算中。海陸軍費佔全部支出的百分之四十六。若在收入中除去借欵的部分。則軍費可達　收入的百分之七十。支出與收入不相應。彌補的方法爲發行公債。現在日本政府的公債額巳達八、五〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。至本年度終。國債額或將達一〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元。這是日本財政當局所認爲飽和點的了。事實上本年度所擬發行的一五〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元公債額。已有無法消納之勢。德國在本年初因爲準備恢復軍備。在一月間强迫發行了五萬萬馬克的公債。來源是各儲蓄銀行的準備金。到三月中。又以保險公司的華備金。發行了同一數額的公債。德國的整軍使法國不得不同樣增大其國防預算。自一九三〇年以來。法國財政的短絀已累增至二七、六一七、〇〇〇、〇〇〇法郞。本年度預算的短絀是六、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇法郞尙有。特別支出五、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇法郞。合起來財政虧損的數目是很可觀的了。最近法政府裁員减薪所引起的糾紛。也足以顯出其財政窘迫的情况。意國年來在對外貿易上步步减退。雖用了關稅保護匯兌管理和限制無形輸出等等方法。都不見效。結果財政大受影響。從去年十二月到本年二月。就不得不自國家銀行取出二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇里拉。以付償輸入的貨物。木年因爲積極準備東非戰爭。輸入的需要大增。在七月中旬竟不得不停止百分之四十二金準備的辦法。竭所有財富以備戰。本年度意國財政的短絀。爲一、七〇二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇里拉。關於東非戰爭的特別支出。還沒有計算在內。現在戰爭未開始。每日在非洲的軍費支出約需五百萬至一千萬里拉。則將來戰爭發勁。或蔓延得廣大時。在財政的負担上確是一個重大的難題了。</p>
<p>國際政治的觀察者以爲列强的整軍備戰。有兩個原因。一是財政困難。需要向外奪取市塲。一是經濟恐慌。人民生活不安。需要以對外的戰爭。刺激其愛國心。使不致因生活不安而趨向革命。似乎財政困難爲。因而發動戰爭爲果了。但整軍備戰。第一卽使財政的負担更見加重。人民的生活益感不安。戰爭所包含的危險因素。主要在此。在戰雲瀰漫世界的今日。對於各國的執政當局和人民。這點當是最困難的問題。也是最値得重視的敎訓吧。</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>乃德於是去了，同來的時候，他袋裏有了兩塊錢，他取出來給其他的童子看，心裏甚爲滿意，同時講給他們聽他那個下午在那邊怎樣快樂，這些年輕人怎樣優待他，他們怎麼讚美他的跳舞樂，幷且允許以後再來找他。</p>
<p>「這比起沿街奏樂不知好了多少，因爲那時我一個錢也不能到手，現在一起都歸了我，幷且是有吃有笑高高興興的。我現在也已做了生意，正如韜摩和解客一般，我眞異常喜歡』，乃德說道，拍拍那個老錢袋，得意揚揚，自己覺得已是百萬的財主了。</p>
<p>他的生意幷且是興吒得很，因爲入夏以後各處郊叙很多，於是各處對於乃德的技能需要也激增。他可以應聘而去，但須不妨害功課，幷且郊叙的人必須是好好的靑年。因爲裴先生說明給他聽，初步優良的學業基礎是人人所必須的，至於金錢呢，不管怎麽的多，郤不能因了它而入於放僻邪侈的險逮的：乃德也頗贊成這個主張。有時美麗的車輛停在大鬥前來接他，這中心一片純潔的童子揚長而去，或者彈着琴奏凱而歸，雖然疲倦，郤甚快樂，一個袋裹裝了他技能所換來的錢，幷且還從宴席裏帶了此「好東西」回來，給他所從不忘記的小梅和小坦第的</p>

<p>今年大水，江河同漲，長江水不位，雖已低落，但黃河依然到處潰决，是多麼不幸！小朋友，見著目前災情嚴重，也曾感覺到以後要防災嗎，如果有這樣好志願，須及早具有科學根底，將來纔可應用科學，征服自然。</p>
<p>荷蘭水利工程，推爲世界第一，荷蘭地勢很低，有好多地方在海平面以下，比我國黃河和長江兩流域要容易被水了，全靠用科學方法，築着隄防，和海水奮鬥，有時竟排去海水，把海灘變成陸地，從來是受不着水患的，爲什麼我國轉成反比例呢？</p>
<p>語云「黃河百害」，已自古爲患，歷代雖少不了治河，惜當時無科學眼光，所以過些年代，又要潰决，至於長江，本有利無害，近年鬧水，也很厲害，有人說「因洪澤湖淤淺不能容水緩衝」，有人說「沿江沙田太多，所以隄岸易潰」，又有人說「江裏往來輪船，傾倒燒過的煤炭，年深日久，把江底塡淺，所以水勢汎漲」……</p>
<p>這些釀災原因，都各有理由，要想防災，須效法荷蘭，具奮鬥精神，用科學方法，大規模整理，纔得一勞永逸，否則後患無窮，不堪設想。</p>
<p>不過水利工程，一須明暸地理，一須熟知數學，小朋友，有志水利防災，對此兩科，要注意學習，纔有基礎。</p>
<h3 id="c188">洪秀全的幼年 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 穡秋</p>
<p>自從明朝亡後，滿淸入關，統治了幾百年，對於人民，壓迫得太厲害了，所以在道光咸豐之間，激起了一回大革命，這革命的領袖，便是洪秀全。</p>
<p>他生於西曆一千八百十三年，這時是淸朝嘉慶十八年七月。他是廣東花縣地方人，父親名叫國游，是一個很賢能的人物，母親很早就故世了，他們一家，世代是洪族的族長。</p>
<p>他的祖先，在明朝做大官的很多，明亡之後，大家立誓不降滿淸，便同明朝許多遺民，由廣東北境的嘉廣州遷移到花縣。所以他反對滿淸的思想，還是祖上傳統下來的。</p>
<p>他到了七歲，開始進塾讀書，因爲天資聰明，進步很快。他對於歷史的學問，特別有興味，但是家裏窮得很，出錢買書，實是一件不容易的事。他的老師，愛他聰明伶俐，常常免去他的學費，有時還送幾部關於歷史的書給他。可是到了十六歲那年，畢竟因爲家境更窮，要謀自立了，所以只得輟學。</p>
<p>秀全脫離了村塾之後，便在村裏自己敎書糊口。那時是科舉時代，讀書人要想做官唯一的捷徑，便是學了八股文去應試。他因爲窮得無聊，也想去試試，不料去應試了兩次，都沒有考取，於是大爲憤怒，索性不再去應試，專門研究若基督敎的聖經，後來便正式加入了基督敎，不久竟被推爲敎主。</p>
<p>這時，他反對滿淸的主張更堅，一方面傳敎，一方面却借此宣傳革命。因此結納了楊秀淸石達開等不少豪傑。後來，他見時機成熟，便揭竿而起，不到三年，勢力竟達到南京。淸朝大半江山，差不多到了他管轄之下，他建立的國號，叫做太平天國。但結果仍歸於失敗。</p>
<p>小朋友！我們要知道，無論什麽事情，只有內部團結，纔能做得起來。洪秀全等，自從廣西起事，便勢如破竹，這是內部團結一致的綠故。可是後來到了南京，內部團結的精神，漸漸煥散，大家只知道爭奪權位，互相殘殺，把對外的心，都移到了對內，所以末了仍被滿淸消滅，這是很可惜的。</p>

<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>又是星期日了，許多小朋友都坐着，等候科學先生來變戲法。可是科學先生和助手並不上臺，卻從前排座位那邊走過來了。那助手的手裏捧了一隻盛着水的面盆，盆裏放着四隻用軟木塞做成的小船。他把這面盆放在一隻凳子上，於是小朋友們都聚集攏來觀看。</p>
<p>「有趣！有趣！」小朋友們歡呼起來了，原來這四隻小船這時正浮在水面，自動地游來游去。</p>
<p>「你們覺得這些小船好玩麽？那末就回去自己做做着。材料是很簡單的，祗要兩三片軟木塞，兩三枚舊唱針—就是唱留聲機片的針，和一塊磁石—馬蹄形的，棒形的都可以。</p>
<p>「怎樣做法呢？先把軟木塞切成扁平的圓片，約兩三片。再把唱針的一端，放在磁石上，向一個方向摩擦，擦了一會，再把他端向另一方向摩擦。你們知道，唱針是鐵製成的，鐵在磁石上摩擦之後，它自己也成磁石，也能够吸引其他的鐵了。唱針磁化了之後，便把他們穿入軟木塞的中央，使它們浮在水面，就成爲兩三隻小船了。</p>
<p>「這兩三隻小船，都附有磁性的唱針，因爲磁性的小針，能够互相吸引和拒斥，所以小船便很有趣的移動着了。</p>
<p>『小朋友們一定要問：磁性的唱針爲什麼能够互相吸拒呢？原來凡是磁石都有南北兩極，常指着南方的一極稱爲南極，常指着北方的一極，稱爲北極。把磁針的南極移近別一顆磁針的南極，就互相拒斥；如果移向別一顆磁針的北極，就互相吸引，這叫做「同極相斥，異極相引」。這些小木塞裏因爲穿着有吸引拒力的磁針，所以就都會移動起來了。</p>
<p>「這是很有趣的玩意兒，我希望你們自己去試試看。』</p>

<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>你們得知道，啄木鳥本來不是烏，却是一僩鼻子很長的老婦人。伊把這長鼻子伸入別人的的頭裏和盆子裏，嗅着，竊聽着：什麽東西都要探聽是不是屬於伊的，伊好管閑事，愛搬嘴舌，常對鄰人們惡作劇。天神看送伊的行爲，就拿了一隻大布袋，把螞蟻，蚊蠅，甲蟲和各種昆蟲盛在袋裏，把袋口縛緊，然後把這布袋送給那老婦人，對伊說道：「把這布袋帶回去，但須留意切莫將它開視，假如你的好奇心使你把鼻子仲進這袋里去，你就要遭受無窮的禍害。」</p>
<p>老婦人回答：「我决不幹這樣的事。我决不違背天種的意志。我一定留心。」</p>
<p>伊把這布袋負在背上，開始回家走；可是當她背起這布袋的時候，伊的手指已經扭動了。走小多遠，伊委實忍耐不住，便在草地上坐下來，把布袋解開來看。這正是袋里的那些昆蟲所願望的；伊剛解開布袋，宅們就爬出來，在地上逃散，各自跑各自的路，儘速地跑着。幾個躱在地下，幾個逃進草下面，還有幾個爬到樹上去，都儘速地奔跑着。</p>
<p>老婦人看到這情形，大吃一驚：伊願望把這些昆蟲收拾回來，再放進布袋里去。可是那些昆蟲並不等候伊。它們知道逃避的方法，大多數已經逃走了。有幾個被伊捉住，就放進袋裏，把袋口縛緊。這當兒，天神的聲音伊聽釗了；他問伊幹了什麽事情，是否違背天神的命令。</p>
<p>「我給你帶去的螞蟻，蚊蠅，甲蟲和各種昆蟲到那里去了？從這時候起，你將變成一隻鳥，把這些昆蟲收拾回來，直到我給你的昆蟲全收齊了，到那時你纔再變成人。」</p>
<p>於是這老婦人變成一隻啄木鳥了，伊的長鼻子變成一隻長嘴；到處找尋這此，螞蟻，蚊蠅，甲蟲和各種昆蟲，希望把它們全數放進那布袋里使自己再變成人。可是，直到現在，伊的工作尙未完畢，所以伊仍然是一隻啄木鳥。</p>

<p>今年各地發生水災，報紙上有紀載，雜誌上有照片，想必小朋友們都看見過了；那麼請仔細想想：水頭那樣大！水勢那樣急！成年的人還可以設法逃難，小孩子們跑又跑不動，爬又爬不高，所以許多兒童都在哭啼喊叫中給大水淹沒了！幸而有些沒有給洪水淹死的，也是餓着肚皮，朝不保夕，你想這是多麽悲慘的事呀。</p>
<p>從前嗬囒有一個童子，他用一隻手掩往漏水的堤口，在寒風中凍了一夜，但他終於救了一村人的性命。我們中國的兒童缺少勇氣，並且河流湍急，也不是少數人在短時期內能够治理：所以希望全國的小朋友們，對於那些淹在水裏的兒童，都要予以深切的同情，有財力的施資救濟，有志氣的研究水利，造成專門治水的人才，使得我們國裏永遠再不發生水患，那豈不很好嗎？</p>

<p>平常人步行，二小時才可以走十里路，如以自行車代步一小時就能走十里，這不是節省勞力與時間嗎？但是騎車時，也要有相當技術。記得我初學的時候，很費氣力，並且天天要練習，才能漸漸地純熟，現在其騎得很自由，轉動也很靈便，可見無論何事總要練習啊！</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>一聽得這話，那些軍曹們，兵士們不論受傷的或沒有傷的都分頭趕到窗前去，重又振作精神的抵抗起來，不多一會，眼見得敵人們漸漸地退下去，起了一陣騷亂。老大佐忽地聚攏了幾個兵士，在槍尖上裝了刺刀到樓下去抵抗那大門外進攻的敵人，接着他又回到樓上去。那知他還沒有跑上樓梯，猛聽得外面起了一陣忙亂的脚步聲和響亮的歡呼聲，當下便有許多意大利騎兵的尖盔在烟霧中出現，雪亮的指揮刀在空氣中呼呼地揮動着，向敵人們衝來，刀鋒霍霍地在敵人們的頭上和肩背上亂劈着；於是老大佐也就領着他的幾個兵士衝出門去。敵人們的陣綫頓時搖解，終於敗退下去。敵人們是退盡了，屎子是保住了，一會兒就有兩營的意大利步兵和兩尊大砲佔住了附近的高原。</p>
<p>老大佐在最後的衝鋒中，被一個槍彈擊傷了一隻手。可是這一天的勝利是歸於意大利人了。第二天意奧雙方繼續作戰，意大利兵雖是奮勇的抵抗，但因衆寡不敵，終於失敗，在二十六日的早晨，全軍退往明西歐河。</p>
<p>老大佐雖受了傷，仍還帶着他的一隊兵，向明西歐河進行，在日落的時候，他們很疲乏的到了國多鎭中。他立刻去找他的中尉，中尉在戰中斷了一條臂，被紅十字會的救護車先就運到這裏。有人指示老大佐說那一座禮拜堂巳改做了臨時的傷兵醫院，那中尉也許會在那裏的。老大佐即忙趕去，見禮拜堂中巳充滿了傷兵，都躺在兩排帆布床上，地板上更舖滿了一張張的墊褥。兩個外科醫生和好幾個勤務兵，都很忙亂的往來走動，四下裏只聽得交織着一大片呼號與呻吟的聲音。</p>
<p>老大佐進了門，就停住了脚，向四面張望，很着意的找尋他的中尉，這時他忽地聽得一個低弱的聲音在他近邊喚道：「大佐！」</p>
<p>他回頭一看，却見那人正是小鼓手。他躺在一張小木床上，身上包裏着一塊紅白相間的窗紗，直包到脖子裏，他的兩臂伸在外邊，臉兒又瘦又白，但他的兩個眼睛仍像兩團炭火似的燃燒着。</p>
<p>老大佐又驚又喜的說道：「這麼！可是你麽？好呀！你巳盡了你的責任。」</p>
<p>小鼓手答道：「我只盡我的能力罷了。』</p>
<p>「你受了傷麽？」老大佐問，一面望着四面的床舖，仍在找尋他的中尉。</p>

<p>出洋考察女子教育！</p>
<p>報載前江蘇省立蘇州女中校長陳淑女士，因月前該校師範科發生風潮，堅决辭職後，近由江蘇敎廳派遺出洋，實地考察女子敎育，不日即將成行。陳女士是中委吳稚暉老先生的外姪，在國內有限的女名人中，穩占一把交椅。她的履歷，單看報上那個簡單的記載，也是：</p>
<p>「留英學生前輩，北平女高師敎授六年，女高附中十年，蒙藏專門學校三年，長蘇女師八年。」</p>
<p>若還仔細地寫來，諒可連成好一大串。這樣一個有地位辦子女敎育多年的女先生，這樣有地位的女先生被派遺出洋考察女子敎育，我們婦女是多麽的榮幸！</p>
<p>年來國內的女子敎育，巳經到了刮肉剝皮的垂死的狀態，外之受經濟衰落和復古潮流帶來的鄙視女性的影響，使女生的數目日稀：內之學校敎育者本身，糊塗渾沌，毫無眼光，致使女子敎育，有等於無，眞呌人痛心！目前一般敎育者對於女生，一如對男生之在「黑板前唸經」了事。不知男生在學校雖未受「人格」的薰陶，出校後雖不能希望他有偉大的志願，但至少由於社會的習慣，大抵尙知從事謀生自立；至於女生，若全不拾她「人格獨立一的啟示，則出校後仍將如向日的依人：於是不爲腐化的追逐公子豪商的摩登姑娘，便爲沒落的從父從夫的無用婦女。目前出了校門的女生，哪兒不充滿了這一種現象？</p>
<p>最近更不成話，許多女學校當局，趕着無謂的時髦，竟以「敝校以養成良妻賢母爲宗旨」的招牌相號召。「良妻賢母」這東西，沒有學校敎育以前，不是已經彀好了嗎？家裏現成的祖母，母親，以及諸姑伯姊，還有藏着的女兒經，女四書，女誡，女論語，不就儘彀教育了嗎？要辦些女子中學，女子師範，女子大學等等何用？然而我們的女學校當局，却還是那麼昏憤，還以敎育今日的女子去做家庭，丈夫的奴隸爲榮！全不想在我們半殖民地的國中，多製造幾個「人才」，以爲爭取自由的張本，而反大批地製造委曲從順的「奴才」，以作亡國後的順民。這是如何地急待糾正？</p>
<p>今日的女子敎育，最要的常在去掉她們的依人的習慣，苟安的思想，萎靡的精神，扭模的行爲；而建設她們的獨立人」的觀念，爭自由平等的勇氣，爲社會服務的熱忱，對國際現象的關心……要照這樣做才可站在女校的講壇而無愧怍，要大家照樣努力做，才可對垂危的女子敎育，有可挽救。</p>
<p>據聞陳女士此次放洋，擬先到德意兩國，考察所謂「女子回家庭」運動，這不免使人懸懸。西洋的婦女對萬千的職業部門，都已有能力加入，這正是他們女子敎育優良的地方：陳女士不去考察這些地方，而去注意於德意的倒行逆施的婦女回家運動！這不但將貽被陳女士開除了的蘇女中同學以「老悖」之譏的口實，而於國內的女子敎育前途，也將有無窮的隱禍。「女子是社會人，不是家庭人」一，這層眞理，應如磐石的不可轉移。肚行於婦女爲功爲罪，陳女士實臨到了嚴重的分歧：願及時撥正長征的指南，以免萬里徒勞</p>
<h3 id="c201">評蕭雯君的「自勉自勵」 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 盧蘭</p>
<p>在關於婦女問題的論戰久已沈寂的時候，珍妮君和簫雯君在在婦女園地及大晚報婦女週刋的最近數期中，展開了關於婦女自勉自勵問題的熱烈的論戰，這是很值得我們注意的事情。因爲這種論戰，不管其誰勝誰敗，總能够給我們以更高的理論的指示。</p>
<p>在他們的數次論戰中，雙方的意見已很充分的具體的表示出來了。總括的說起來，簫雯君是主張：婦女要得到解放，祇須自勉自勵，不可靠男子。珍妮君的意見則反是；單靠婦女的自勉自勵是不够的，「應該聯合覺悟的男子界，一致完成反帝反封建的工作，建設合理的社會」一，方能獲得婦女的解放。這裏我們覜戰者也得到辨別是非的機會，同時將由觀戰者成爲參戰者了。我是同意珍妮君的意見，而反對蕭雯君的主張。</p>
<p>蕭雯君在「自勉自勵」（大晚報婦女週刋弟三三期）一文中居然展開了他的極不正確的理論，因時暴露了他關於這問題的認識不够！簫雯君以爲婦女的自勉自勵是解放婦女的唯一途徑。他說：「至於婦女問題是婦女階級（這種名詞的亂用是表示蕭雯君的常識不够。我們應常告訴蕭雯君：婦女不是階級，而是抽象的性的區別。）本身的事，這猶之勞動問題屬於勞動階級一樣。」又說：「婦女自身的事得山婦女自已去解决，我們要自勉自勵，要自勉自勵才能打破封鎖得很久的鐵門呀！」說了以後他更認爲這段話「沒有半點錯誤」！可是在我們看來，這段話才是根本的錯誤。</p>
<p>第一，婦女問題决不是單純的婦女自身的事，而是整個社會問題的一環。因此在婦女當中固然有需要解放的婦女和不需要解放的婦女，而且在男子當中也有需要解放婦女的男子和不需要解放婦女的男子。</p>
<p>第二，所謂自勉自勵必須有能够自勉自勵的條件，「自己腦子裏面源空想出來」的自勉自勵是唯心論者的觀念遊戲，否則楚欺蝙的符咒！「封鎖得很久的鐵門」，假使沒有具備可能把牠打破的條件，而要鐵門內被封鎖的人去自勉自勵，要他去打破，哪顯然是欺騙。任封建制度底下沒有具備婦女們自勉自勵的條件，所以不能存在婦女解放運動，到資本主義社會，因爲具備了這種條件，所以英國的女權運動者們，能够「敲破了玻璃窗，毀壞了郵筒，舉行偉大游行一，但這種自勉自勵也不是單純的婦女自身的事，而是當時英國的多數徹底主張民主政治的男子們都同情及帮助婦女的參政運動。說到目前我國的婦女，正在被帝國主義及封建勢力的鐵門緊緊的鎖着，要打破這個鐵門，單靠婦女的自勉自勵是不够的，必須聯合反帝反封建的男人們，「全力鬥爭」。因爲只有這樣才能解決目前的社會問題，同時解决婦女問題。</p>
<p>蕭雯君觀察事實，確有不深刻甚至歪曲現實之嫌。現在大多數的男子都要建設男女平等的合理的社會，在到處流血奮鬬，這是現實的事實，但他却說：「……男子們是否會自動覺悟，來援助婦女還是一個問題。……他們還在迷戀着男性中心社會。」現在許冬婦女鎖在封建的鐵門內要自勉自勵而無從自勉自勵，而且不准自勉自勵，這也是事實。但蕭雯君却站在「鐵門」外高興談着風凉的話：「婦女必須自動的撤去黑暗之幕，讓自家的靈魂從魔崇中解放出來」。我們當然不反對婦女「自動的撤去黑暗之幕一，但社會必須給予她們以能够「自動」的條件，有了這個條件，則不待蕭雯君的諄諄勉勵，她們伸馬上「自動」起來的。譬如監房裏的囚犯發見了能够安然逃脫的條件，便馬上「自動」的脫逃一樣。</p>
<p>自勉曰勵這句話，原有兩重用意。支配者用種種制度來束縛好了被支配者，剝奪他們的所有自勉自勵的可能性，然後對他們說：你們的被支配是活該，因爲你們不自勉自勵。這是一面。在他面被支配者認識到了自己的力量能够解放自己而有餘時，起來反抗支配者，這是有目的有意識的革命的自勉自勵。蕭雯君的「自勉自勵」乃屬於前者。否則「從自己的腦子裏憑空想出來」的虛幻的自勉自動。</p>
<p>婦女問題爲社會問題的一環，牠必須和社會問題同時解决這件事，稍有社會科學的常識的人都能理解。唯獨蕭雯君不懂得這樣顯而易見的道理，却拿了所謂自勉自勵的帶着幾分欺騙性的名詞來要把婦女問題和社會問題對立，要把婦女和男子對立。我覺得這是不容忽視的錯誤。這裏祇好奉勸蕭雯君快收論戰旗鼓，退而三思之</p>
<h3 id="c202">看了「自由神」以後 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 琴貞</p>
<p>在男性中心的社會裏，往往有許多男子把女子當做了財產似的爭奪着，他們爭奪的目的，只是爲了滿是他們自己的佔有慾。他們那些甜言蜜語和種種的方法，使得許多女性被他們迷惑而以爲這是恋愛；結果上了他們的當，而被他們當做了玩物。可是女子是人，也是一個堂堂的人，爲什麼她們應當做男子們的玩物讓他們玩弄呢？當然有許多是出於不得已，但也有許多的人們是自己看輕了自己，自己情願放棄了自己應有的自由而去做男子的玩物。但是，智識階級的婦女們至少應當明白這樣會使婦女們在社會上的地位一天天地降低，因此她們應當負起她們應有的責任爲社會盡她們應盡的義務，而奪回她們應有的自由。更要了解什麽是眞王戀愛和反對男性抱着玩弄的熊度的追求。自五四運動起，我們巳經可以看到有許多女子們在努力於反帝和革命的工作。這種過去的史跋，很可以給智識婦女們一個很有力的刺戟，使她們想到過去的婦女工作更加努力於現在。</p>
<p>「自由神」這部影片，就是以這些爲主題寫成的故事，它更明確地指出在今日的社會裏是需要婦女們和男子們共同推進，並且反對男子把女子當做了玩物，所以它是一部最合於婦女們看的作品。</p>

<p>冷風吹着，零碎的冰雪從樹上的的答答地掉下。太陽由橫面晒來，泥堆上一塊明一塊暗，還有長條的樹杆子的影子。一個黑黝黝的洞，洞口一堆雪，小尼子跑前過去，把那雪挖了一火把，揑成一團，邊吃邊走地回到原位位；</p>
<p>——你要吃？</p>
<p>——好「給一點我！」修珍吃了一口，冷得打了個寒驚，一半吐掉了。她坐動了一個位置，到有太陽的石上</p>
<p>——本來雪壓過，有很多柴可抓，現在可很少了，……割白了，抓的人又多。」小尼子看看修珍的柴簍又說：「怎麽你只抓了這一點點？」她忙立起，飛快地採折了不枯的柴，放進修珍的柴箕。「哪！這種也好的哪：晒幾個太陽就可以燒了。」她指着小松樹上靑綠鮮活的枝稍。</p>
<p>修珍站起，也學她那樣地採，又兩個人帮拔一支露出在黃泥上的樹根。</p>
<p>——上海的山是怎麽樣的？」小尼子問。</p>

<p>——做什麽，做什麽，是我哩！」那男人走近在她們的面前說。他手中提了一隻野猪。</p>
<p>——你賤胎養的，我以爲這次定要被捕住了。」小尼子笑着罵。</p>
<p>這男人原來是偷柴的同夥，不過他此次並不來偷柴，他是在岡上面作了個壓殺籠，今天運氣好，厭殺的是一隻野猪。</p>
<p>——呵唷！你今天攏得這個……！」小尼子驚喜地，着實也帶點羨慕的樣子。她搜摸野猪的背。</p>
<p>——你也來？」那男子瞧着修珍說。他顯出喜悅的神情。因爲修珍是他的舊伴，當她尙未去上海的時候，他們常常一道到山上或是田野中提蚱蜢，摸田螺。那時小尼子還很小，什麼也不曉得，現在他們三個人合在一起了，在歸途中，他們都帮同着修珍採柴，尤其是那個男子帮採得格外多。</p>
<p>——這樣，他不會看見我們了。」小尼子說。</p>
<p>——你有沒有給他們捉去過</p>

<h3 id="c204">第四節　避孕與墮胎 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>已瀕於沒落的資本主義社會制度，是不單成爲經濟的生產力發達的桎梏，同時成爲人類的生殖力發述的桎梏。不斷發生的帝國主義侵略戰爭，及反革命戰爭是殺死和殘傷了無數健全的人民，定期的勃發的經濟恐慌是產生出廣大的失業者及飢餓羣？此外僅能持續其個人生命的工人，繼續破產的農民，殖民地的「民族奴隸」以及沒有嫁娶的經濟能力的小職員，店員等等，都成爲這社會制度的犧牲品，不能執行自然所賦與的本能的生殖任務。他們的經濟生活决定他們的性生活，他們不單爲經濟的被榨取者，同時爲性的被榨取者。因爲他們沒有組織家庭生活的經濟能力，所以不敢嘗試合法的正式結婚，又害怕生育子女，他們祇好在社會各方面尋求不負任何責任的洩慾的機會，於是發生了跡近好通的所謂「友愛結婚」，公的及私的賣淫行爲，離婚的頻繁，殺兒，棄兒，避孕及打胎等等種種不道德的社會現象。</p>
<p>在如上的社會關係底下，避孕樂和打胎術便成爲社會的必需品而出現，而且這種知識很快的普及於中下層的靑年男女間。特別中小層知識婦女及職業婦女巳很普遍的採用這種方法。因爲她們雖即使正式結婚，但一有了孩子，她的職業便馬上發生問題，沒有養育子女的可能，所以婦女比男子更有着避孕的决心，假使避得不得法，受了孕的時候，也要訴諸弟十步方法即打胎。關於這問題，我們有很好的統計資料，可以拿來參考一下。</p>
<p>美國的德維士博士對於一千名的婦女質問避孕藥的使用與否，結果知道了七百三十名即七三％都採用這方法。其中五百二十名爲大學及專門學校畢業生，四十名受女學校敎育，二十名爲私立學校敎員，四十七名爲專門學校在學生，一百。三各爲女學校及師範學校畢業生。（「結婚的破產」）</p>
<p>又據美國卡乃基研究所的研究，六百九十七名的婦人中，產兒共有一千三百五十一名，而打胎共有一千八百四十八件。即打胎數超過產兒牧。（同上）</p>
<p>以上是美國的實踐，但在日本東京也發兇了驚人的統計數字。就是單在警察廳管轄內，以產兒調節及通經問答爲營業的，共有四十七處，這些營業者報告於當局的數字，訪問這些營業者的人數每月平均有五千七十六名，其收入每月平均有九千八百五十元。以墮胎爲業的母友會自開業以來四年問受理通經問答的數共達十餘萬件，每日後各地方寄來的詢問書，平均有一百件以上，直接訪問者亦達二三十人，巳受墮胎手術者達於數百名。（女性五十講）</p>
<p>避孕藥品的精製及打胎技術的發達，更是促進如上的情勢·資本主義社會的支配者們，一方面以避孕及打胎爲罪惡·要用法律來制止牠，但他方面讓資本家去大批的製造避孕藥，公然推銷，這正是一面獎勵種烟而他面禁止吸烟一樣的滑稽。</p>
<p>資本主義國家爲着挽救已瀕於破產的家族及結婚制度，爲着增殖在將來戰爭中當砲灰的人口，在法律上禁售避孕藥，禁止打胎行爲，但這種法律在婦女的立塲看來，也就是以婦女的犧牲爲前提的東西。在現社會底下大多數陷於貧窮不幸的境遇的婦女，生育子女完全是婦女自身的痛苦和負担，無論國家或男子都不會分担她的痛苦。因此婦女必須有决定受不受這個痛苦的權利，即是說，婦女應當有避孕或打胎的楝利。我們要反對這柿法律的理由就在此點。</p>
<p>記得在數年前，美國的山格夫人到我國來，提倡她的新馬爾薩斯主義，就是主張用避孕及墮胎等方法實行產兒制限。她認爲婦女對於是否要做母親或要做幾個孩子的母親的問題，有自行决定的絕對自由，不管男性的態度如何，這問題始終屬於婦女自身的權利。雖然由格夫人的所謂產兒制度是一種消極的改良主義的方法，但她所指出的「自山母性」的觀念是值得推崇的。</p>
<p>我們要廳得，在合理的社會制度底下，除了特殊的事情外，總不會發生避孕和打胎的不自然的現象，人類生育子女原是極自然的本能的要求。在不得已的生活條件之下，不得不避孕的男女，也不願意永久的破壞他的生殖機能。特別大多數的婦女都有着想做母親的熱望。假使社會給她們能的做母親的優惠的條件，那末，避孕和打胎當不禁而自滅—這裏有實例，幾年前美國的婦女們邀請剛從蘇聯回來的女視察員，請他談蘇聯的婦女生活。她說：「在蘇聯避孕和打胎均極自由，若要墮胎，國家的醫院施以免費手術，極爲安全。」談到這裏，聽衆中異口同聲說：「那末牠們都可以不生孩子了，那是多好呀！」可是這位女視察員搖着手說道，「不！她們倒喜歡生孩子呢！因爲生孩子的婦女是受國家的特別優待。不論在經濟上或社會上都認定的母親的特權，旣有可愛的孩子，又有國家的生保障及社會的特權，何樂而不爲！」聽了大家都豁然太悟！</p>

<p>— 唐乃康</p>
<p>古語云：「其作始也簡，將畢也鉅。」簡易而鉅艱，為當然而非偶然，故凡製一器物，建一事業，冀其有所成，而至於久遠。莫不知今日之簡而易，乃有未來之鉅而艱也。敎育事業，為凡百事業之一，其始簡畢鉅，又何獨不然？能勝其簡易而不勝其鉅艱，則進銳而退　，所以有不免者歟？</p>
<p>余之創建本校，當始作之時，未嘗不惴惴心懼，懼者何？懼其繼往開來之匪易；至中途挫折，倏為吿止。又非余之願也！果也，成立後之五年，入學者激增，賃屋不敷，不得不籌建廣厦；升學無所，不得不添辦中學。再越五年，疊逢江浙戰爭，奉直交閧，艱苦支持，雖在鋒鏑之中，而弦歌未嘗或　。更越五年，陸遭國難，　舍被焚，僅餘瓦礫，於痛定思痛之餘，不得不急圖恢復，以安我遠道負笈之學子。於是掃除灰燼，重建新厦，經營一稔，幸復舊觀。今茲又越五年矣，農村破產，社會衰落，經濟上之支持，較之十年以前之困苦，已不可以道里計，較之二十年以前之困苦，非特不可以計，抑亦弗　計矣！此二十年間之經歷，有為最初所預料之鉅艱，亦有最初所不及料，而所謂鉅艱，實什佰倍於預料者也！</p>
<p>余之惴惴於昔日，即此二十年間預料所及與預料所不及之鉅艱，然當此鉅艱相加時，余惟知毅然承之，泰然赴之，絕不更事惴惴，以自餒其志。本校之幸免於傾覆，至今猶巋然存在者，固全賴乎校董會諸先生與社會上熱心敎育者之維護，而余之惴惴於昔日而不鰓鰓於今日，要亦有些微之成效也。</p>
<p>今者，我校已達二十周年　，二十年間之經歷，凡關懷本校之諸君，當亦耳熟能詳，無待絮述矣。然余對此後未來之二十年，又不禁惴惴心懼，懼者何？懼其繼往開來之匪　　至中途挫折，倏焉　止，又非余之願也！余惟有本已往之精神，與我全校敎職員諸君子曁全校學子，相期共勉，至鉅艱相加，亦惟知毅然承之，泰然赴之，不再更事惴惴以自餒其志而已！二十周紀念特刋編成，即以此言弁其端，以代發刋之詞云。</p>
<h3 id="c206">校史 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>本校原名市北公學，成立迄今，已二十載。此二十載中，大別言之，可分六時期：自民國四年八月，至五年一月，為「草創」時期；五年二月，至九年一月，為「改進」時期；九年二月，至十一年一月，為「建設」時期；十一年二月，至二十年，為「擴充」時期；二十一年一月，至二十二年終，為「蒙難」時期；二十三年以來為「復興」時期矣。茲就其經過情形，略述梗槪，俾世之留心敎育事業者，得知本校之沿革焉。</p>
<p>（一）草創時期本校創辦人唐校長伯耆，以上海為中外觀瞻所繫，又為文化發達之區，乃敎育事業，操諸外人，大權旁落，深以為恥。且其時市北一帶，更無國人自辦之完善學校。爰於民國四年秋，斥其私資，創立本校於北站界路慶詳里；以地處滬市之北，定名為市北公學。雖以經費竟蹶，規模設備，類皆因陋就簡，然在敎訓方面，不稍怠忽，師生之間，共以精神敎育相勉也。</p>
<p>（二）改進時期　五年春唐校長商諸海上名流李登輝先生等，組織校董會，以為維持指導之機關，而江浙英彥，先後加入者，計達三十餘人，或助常年經費，或代規劃進行。於是來校就學者，為數激增，敎訓方面，因勢改進，歷經敎育行政機關派員視察，同聲贊許，而社會之聲譽，亦繼長增高，日進弗已。</p>
<p>（三）建設時期　九年春，男女學生已達五百餘人，校舍雖增，猶處擁擠。遂由唐校長建議校董會，擬籌欵自築校舍，以利敎學。當經全體贊同，組織建築校舍委員會，公舉簡照南先生為委員長，並由簡君首先認捐二萬元，又基金南洋兄弟煙草公司股份一千股，而王儒堂錢新之王一決賽權吳蘊齋劉鴻生李拍勤勞敬修沈田莘諸君，亦各分認巨欵，以資提倡。其餘各校董，相繼認捐，或代向各界勤募，竭誠贊助，殊深感佩！次年夏在閘北永興路購地六畝零，並囑南洋建築公司測地繪圖，大興土木。經營二載，而宏敞壯麗之校舍，始吿落成。除禮堂敎室，足容學生六百人外，他如宿舍，膳堂，辦事室，圖書室，調養室，應接室，以及浴室，商店，炊事室，標本儀器室等，均得設備佈置，粗具規模。校舍有廣大操塲，以事運動，即遇盛會舉行，亦不患無適當地矣。</p>
<p>（四）擴充時期　自新校舍落成後，中小學生，年有增加，十一年遵照部章，中小一律採用新學制。十六年組織校務委員會，勵行黨義敎靑。至十七年，由敎育局派員調查合格，中小學奉文批准立案。十八年夏，擴充學額，改訂章程，續辦高中部，以宏造就，增聘敎育界知名之士，擔任敎職。以審察時勢需要，高級中學，暫授混合編制，俾學生他日升學或就業，各得其便。二十年夏，本中學呈報上海市敎育局轉呈敎育部，審查合格，奉准備案。正在積極擴充，藉宏敎育，詎意一二八事變，突然發生。</p>
<p>（五）蒙難時期　二十一年一月二十八日下午十一時半，槍砲之聲大作，戰　以開。二月一日，日機紛紛盤旋於本中學附近空際，拋擲炸彈，校役亦不敢再留。三月二日，我軍退守第二道防綫，日軍即於是晚進佔閘北，永興路一帶，大火三晝夜始熄，本中學同遭焚燬。五月十七日，日軍退出閘北，本校派員前往接收，唯存危桓殘壁，焦土一片，損失二十二萬元有餘。四月八日，中學賃臨時校舍於麥根路，繼續開學，學生到者，不及舊有三分之一，因陋就簡，無可諱言。秋季開學，學生激增，校舍益形窄隘，乃改賃新閘路一〇九五號房屋，於十二月十日遷往。</p>
<p>（六）復興時期　中學賃民屋，旣感採光通氣之不合衛生，復以鬧市而苦運動塲之缺乏。爰創立復興設計委員會，於二十二年三月五日成立大會，除一部分舊有校董外，多黨政商學界聞人，公推陳靄士先生為委員長，吳開先俞鴻鈞二先生為副委員長，進行復興計劃。十月二十一日，在永興路原址，開始興工，重建中學校舍，由陸根記營造廠承造。二十三年一月，遷入新舍，復興初步，粗吿完成。惟小學校舍，因兒童人數增加，頗形狹隘，設備方面，諸多簡陋，添設幼稚園，更覺不敷應用。乃於本年五月，擇定界路永慶里西首三層新厦六幢，在時期中遷入。此後當注重訓敎，充實設備，以期精神形式，同時並進。尚希熱心敎育諸君子，有以見敎，俯賜贊助，不僅本校之幸，抑亦地方敎育之幸也！謹述槪略，諸惟　公鑒！</p>

<p>— 張犂</p>
<p>上海市北中學，原名市北公學，創辦於民國四年之秋。締造之初，稅居民房，僅辦小學若干班，學生數十人耳。十餘年來，由小學而　　，學生逾千人且自建校舍，輪奐美備，斯已難能可貴矣。迨民國二十年，　一二八之難，全校被燬，卒以唐校長乃康之鼓勇奮鬥，越三年而復舊觀。人皆頌其復興之速，余獨佩其政基之善。英之憲政，為世所稱，而英人之論始者，則謂吾英之政治制度，乃自然生長者也。譬諸樹木，其始萌蘗耳，茍能適應環境，與時俱進，則其終必發榮滋長，蔚為巨材。是則自然生長之義也。豈惟政治有然，推諸凡百事業，何莫不然，市北中學始基雖簡，而生氣盎然，應環境之需要，隨時代而邁進。成績旣著，聲譽日隆，一旦遭意外之摧殘，自能博社會之同情，益以主持其事者之熱心毅力，用能於三年之間，奏興復之效。茲値學校二十周年紀念之期，將發行特刋，以誌其盛，遠道徵文於余，輒書所見以歸之，方今國難未已，志士仁人。競言復興，倘亦於此加之意乎？</p>

<h3 id="c219">電政會議一週年之檢討 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>整頓業務程度若何？　便利人民方法若何？</p>
<p>去年交通部爲整理全國電政起見，曾於九月四日召集電政會議於首都，時光迅駛，迄今一週年矣。該會所有提案與决議案，均爲整理電政之根本要圓，其業務部份與利用電信民衆關係甚鉅。作者骨閱該會議錄，知一般會員，鑒於電政經濟之困難，多提議改訂現行報價，以裕收入，而大會决議，以報價問題，應從整頓業務及便利人民着手，統一報價，仍須維持。足見交通部雖在電政困難之時，仍不忍加重民衆負擔，此一年中究竟交通部整頓業務程度若何？與便利人民方法若何？亟爲社會人士所欲知而應加檢討者也。茲特擇要報告如左：</p>
<p>（甲）關於便利人民方面者</p>
<p>查便利人民之方法有二：（一）輕民衆負擔，（二）推廣業務範圍是也。關於前者，（一）加急長途電話改爲二倍收費，（原係三倍收費）（二）减低船舶電報報費，（三）訂定免費或納費公電辦法，（四）减低電匯電報收費，（原係每電不逾二十字者收費六角，額外加收二角五分手續費，現改收費五角，額外費取消）。（五）同城電報改照四分之一價目收費，（舊章二分之一收費）（六）華文明語私務電報或公益電報之收報地名，不論幾字，均作二字計費，（七）華文密語或洋文私務電報或公益電報以及其他各種電報，其收報地名，槪作一字計費，（八）華文私務或公益電報之收報人職銜（例如校長局長委員長）稱謂，（例如先生女士等）均列入收報人住址及名稱內計算字數。凡此皆已實行，與民衆納費有密切關係者也。</p>
<p>關於後者（一）開放中意無綫電直達通報，（二）成立國內電台八處，（三）成立報話營業處及代辦處共三百處，（四）成立市內電話局六處，（五）規定公用電話營業通則及招商經理公用電話通則，（六）訂定市內電話營業通則及國內電報營業通則，（七）辦理車站設置公用電話，（八）委託江南鐵路各站代辦電報，（九）推廣交際電報範圍，（十）開放國際耶穌復活節賀電，（十）（一）規定電話局答復電話用戶詢問當地各種事務辦法，（十）（二）規定縣辦市內電話或鄉村電話與交通部長途或市內電話線通話辦法，（十）（三）規定電信業務播音宣傳辦法，凡此皆已實行，與民衆通信有密切關係者也。</p>
<p>（乙）關於整頓業務方面者</p>
<p>業務之整頓，可分對外對內兩方面，關於對外者，以便利民衆爲依歸，關於對內者，以工作效率爲準則。便利民衆方法，旣如上述，則整頓業務之道，思過半矣，茲將增加工作效率方法，述其梗概如左：</p>
<p>工作效率之表現有二：（一）迅速，（二）正確。二者關於機伴綫路者半，關於辦事手續者亦半，一年以來，不少改進之點。除建設綫路屬於工務範圍無容叙述外，交通部根據報務之繁簡，與政軍通信之需要，隨時調度全國局台電路，支配機件及人手，規定各種機器容量大小標準，如超過某種容量時，酌予增加機器。並擬在天津，漢口，廣州，厦門，等處電台，專設一機，與國際電台直接通報，上項機件，均已購就，正着手裝設。在未裝設以前，由上海局裝設一綫，與國際電台直接通報，京，津，平，漢等局所發或轉之國際電報，發由上海局用克利特機轉國際電臺拍發，該臺所收之報，轉拍京，津，平，漢等局者，亦由上海局轉遞之。現京，滬，平，津，漢，靑等局之繁忙電路，均已改裝克利特機或電報印字機收發電報。已規定之各種詳細辦法，亦可縷舉如下。（一）局臺電路障碍時收受電報辦法，（二）推行公電引得書寫辦法，（三）華文明碼來報譯送辦法，（四）整頓投送來報辦法，（五）收發處稽查辦法，（六）氣象電報廣播辦法，（七）電報錯誤或延誤報告表，（八）時刻校對辦法，（九）電話用戶收費辦法，（十）無綫電傳遞收報局名辦法，凡此皆整頓業務之具體辦法也。</p>
<p>平心論之：近年來交通部對於便利民衆整理業務兩點，似已努力實行，在可能範圍，仍當繼續改進。查電政會議，關於整理電政各案甚多，卽關於業務者亦不少，大抵皆係內部之事，均巳次第辦理，茲僅就與一般利用電信民衆有關者，述其崖略如此，尼見該會並非「議而不决决而不行，行而不力」者可比也</p>
<h3 id="c220">電報局與電話局之合併 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>嘗考各國之郵電交通機關，凡屬國營者，大都合併辦理。如英國之郵政局，日本之郵便局，均係郵電兼辦，蓋所以謀民衆通訊之便利，並爲節省人員及支出計也。我國郵電事業，因創辦時各自爲政，故雖同隸一部，（先屬郵傳部，後改稱交通部），而門戶分立，相沿數十載，徒有合併之議，而輒爲環境所阻，識者惜之！</p>
<p>抑更有進者，同屬電信機關之有綫電報局，無綫電台及電話局，往昔亦分門立戶，不相聯絡，外人之初入我國者，輒多疑爲商辦性質，蓋各國電信事業之屬國營者，鮮有如我國之分三個營業機關，此無他，分立則違反「便利」及」經濟」兩原則也。</p>
<p>交部自朱家驊氏長部以後，鑒於有無綫電之不宜分立，故首先於上年五月問令飭合併。又因郵電合併，在目前實行，事實上困難滋多，故不得巳而先行郵電合設，此二事雖可視爲當然應革之舉，無足爲奇，但觀於年來歷任交通當局之蹉跎未辦，有足多焉。</p>
<p>惟尙有一事未舉者，報話之合併是也。近兩年來，國內長途電話事業，發展甚速。長途電話營業之發展，端賴市內電話爲之銜接通話，而長途電話綫路之維持，則以聯合電報綫路共同修養爲最經濟。職是之故，電話局之與電報局合併，使電報及市內與長途電話打成一片，實爲今日當務之急。交部有鑒及此，於努力建設九省長途電話網之餘，特先將吳縣鎭江兩處報話兩局試行合併，合併以來，不僅報話通訊獲得密切之聯絡，對於節省經費一端，尤著成績。因此交部又續令蕪湖，蚌埠，江都，九江，沙市，鄭縣，洛陽，淸苑（卽保定）等八處電話局與當地電報局實行合併，名稱則暫稱某某电報局，將來俟全部合併後，再改適當之名稱。至上海，北平，天津，首都，武漢，靑島，姻台等電話局，則以規模較大，一時不易合併，俟有適當房屋及籌備完妥時，再行辦理。</p>
<p>報話實行合併以後，我國郵電交通機關，已與英日兩國合理之組織相似？所不同者，郵電主管部分尙末合併，但對外營業則與英日之郵政局，已無二致，此誠我國郵電事業近年來之一大進步也。</p>

<p>— 儲浩</p>
<p>……應行注意之點凡七……</p>
<p>自交通部市內電話營業通則頒布後，關於與公衆有關各點，業經本刋同人先後爲文，闡發靡遺。惟細察所述各點，類皆公衆應享利益之指陳，而公衆對於話局方面應盡之義務，與乎應行遵守之各項話務規章，則尙尠論述。記者不敏，用敢不憚辭費，擇其犖犖諸大端，褸陳於次，俾喚起用戶方面之注意焉：</p>
<p>（甲）關於移拆話機者用戶欲將所裝電話機伴移設他處，或欲將電話機件全部或一部撤去不用者，須於預定遷移或撤去之七日以前，用簽名蓋章之書面通知，述明所請各節，掛號郵遞，或專差通告局方，由局方派遣員工，前來辦理。倘係移機，須由用戶照價目表嶺清各費，以便移設。如有欠費，並須先行繳淸。</p>
<p>（乙）關於更名過戶者用戶欲更改其載入電話號簿之名稱者，應將保蹬金收據送局添註。如欲將電話移轉於他人者，應由新舊兩用戶會同具函通知話局，並將保證金收據送局更換。上述兩事，如用戶自動赴局辦理者，母須繳納更名費或過戶費。如果私自更名或過戶，而不通知話局者，一經查出，應補繳更名費五元，或過戶費十元。</p>
<p>（丙）關於私裝機件者用戶不得：（一）在話機上私裝一切通話設備。（二）私以交換機或互通機裝接於所租用之話綫，而不照正當手續向話局報裝；（三）或私自添裝分機等件於小交換機。違者一經查出，除依法辦理，並暫停其通話外，並須俟一切自私裝機費用，由話戶照數繳淸後，方予恢復通話。以後卽照所裝機件價格，按月照章納費。</p>
<p>（丁）關於取締事項者（一）用戶不得利用電話設備，非法通信，損害國營電信事業。否則一經查出，卽予停話徹機，並永遠停止其電話租用權。（二）用戶不得將一切電話機綫私自移動，或交換，違者一經查出，除依法辦理外，並須加倍收取宅內移費。（三）用戶除承辦公用電話者外，不得將所裝電話，供人使用，收取話費。達者先由局方加以警告；再犯時，罰租費一個月，如不照繳，卽行停話撤機，並永遠停止其電話租用權利。（四）用戶請求裝設電話時，如有希圓省費，冒報種類；或中途趣更種類，隱匿不報者，一經查出，照應補之費，加倍收取，但最多以十二個月爲限。</p>
<p>（戊）希望話戶予以合作者查各地常有不肖之徒，或已經話局斥革之員工，往往假藉名義，闌入話戶，或則手持僞造之單據，冒用話費；或則設辭施工，乘機暗中行竊。凡此情形，深足影響話局信譽，妨害用戶安益。夫話局員工被派出外收費或設施工事，均須佩帶章證，凡吾話戶，嗣後如有話局員工前來收費或工作，務請認明局方證章，以明眞偽，而免受騙。如無證章，卽係冒充，應請拒絕入內，並迅行通知局方，以便查究。再查各地話局員司工役，迭經交通部嚴行誥誡，以和藹循禮爲對外唯一之信條。如有藐視功令，對外缺乏禮貌，或態度粗暴者，務請用戶隨時通知話局或函告南京交通部予以懲戒。又話局技工前往各用戶設施裝、拆、移、修話機工事，均爲應盡之職務，需索酒資，懸爲厲禁，如有不守紀律，違章需索者，務請加以斥責，並通知話局或函告交通部核辦。</p>
<p>上述五項，或關公衆之安寗，或關交換之正確，或關話機之負荷，或關公家之收入，在在與公私雙方有密切之利害。譬如：私移話機，每易阻斷通話，苟萬一稍涉疏忽，而誤觸燈綫，則禍害更不堪設想：私自更名或過戶，足以擾亂交換之正確性，召致其他用戶之責難；私自添裝分機交換機或其他通話設備，足以增加話機之負荷，减損話局之收入；至於利用電話設備，非法通信，妨害國營電信事業，更爲法律所不容，凡此種種，不過聊爲提引，以明利害。總之，欲求市內電話交通之美滿愜意，一方固有賴於話局之維持妥善，然另一方面用戶之循守規章，愛護利器，亦爲必不可少之條件。願電話用戶之致意焉！</p>
<h3 id="c222">留聲片與著作權 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>丹麥製留聲片之四廠家，以丹麥國營無綫電廣播局未得該廠家之許可，用其留聲片廣播，認爲侵害主權，控告於法院。其理由係供據丹麥法律，「一人三工作能藉機械方法利用者，其人與着作者有同樣權利」之一條，經法院判决如下：廣播局對於一九三四年四月十一日以前購置之留聲片，仍可利用，而以後購置者，則不能使用。廠方之賠償要求，以及對於廣播局長之罰金要求，均被拒絕。</p>
<p>按我國廣播事業，尙在萌芽時代，對於此項權利，法律上無條文規定，不能援用，業經內政部解釋矣。</p>
<h3 id="c223">全國電局採行公電密 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 驊</p>
<p>凡電局間內業務或公務接洽而發之電報，都稱一公電」。公電的性質，旣是一種事務接洽的文件，所以在電路上視爲消耗而不生產的東西。可是牠的內容大抵關於某一電戰的查詢更正，或是關於綫路調度測騐，和其它公務的接洽，所以牠的急要程度，反在普通電報之上。我們因此得到不面兩個原則：就是公電在量的方面，應該减少到最低度，務使不妨碍其他報務傳遞的速率。同時在質的方面，應該極端簡明，使處理和傳遞，都能够十分迅速。關於前者，交通部已經訂定了各種限制拍發公電的規章，以免公電的冗濫，關於後者，交通部在去年六月採用國際間通用的馬可尼公電密語，印發南京等三十餘局台試辦。試辦結果，成績極佳。現將該項密語本全部譯成中文，印發全國各電局一律實行。</p>
<p>電局以前拍發業務公電，向來採用英語縮拚，字句也還簡短，但是縮拼字樣無論怎樣省略，每一個字祗能代表一個字的意義，電文的冗長，當然還是不免。現在採用的公電密密語，以一個人工凑合的字替代一句或數句的意義，那末電文的字數，一定可以大大的减少，傳遞的速率，自然也相對的增加。但是密語的替代語句是固定的，運用的時候，當然有些塲合要添加明語，才可以達意，所以交部特地搜集許多公電的常用縮拚字樣，附在「公電密語」後面，以備發寄公電的採用。同時關於以前規定的公電」引得」書寫辦法公電程式，納費公電程式以及其他公電有關法令也一併彙集刊印，作爲「公電密語「的附錄，以供各局人員的參考。</p>
<p>我們知道電路的容量，有一定的限度，若是超過了某種限度，那末必須增加電路或改裝高速度機械，否則電路擁塞，必致報務延擱。不能維持原有的速率。交通部在過去一年中，積極方面已經把各繁要電路改裝高速度穖械擴充電路原有的容量。消極方面，就是嚴厲取締各局發寄不急要的公電，减輕電路的荷載。這種不急要的公電，向來占全部公電中的最多數，經交部切實整頓以後，現在差不多已經絕跡，這是交部對於公電量的方面的最大改進。現在全國電局採行公電密語以後，公電的質的方面，當然是更進一步，達到了簡單與迅捷的合理化。此後電局服務的成績，一定更能得到收發報人的滿意了！</p>
<h3 id="c224">新訂國內電報營業通則內容述略 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 葆眞</p>
<p>現今各電局收發電報手續，莫不依據近兩年來部訂各項章規及沿用十八年所訂電報收發辦法」辦理。惟以迭次訂定之章規辦法，不下數十種之多，不僅外界不能詳悉靡遺。卽電局收發員，深感難於逐一記憶。因電局收發電報，在在與公衆發生接觸必須有詳明周密之規章，方足以釐定相互之關係，而資雙方遵守。電政當局，有鑒於斯，愛特依據十一年所訂「電報收發規則」，十八年所訂「電報收發辦法」，及近年來陸續公布施行之「華文電報省費新章」等各項章規辦法，同時參照「國際電報規則」，制定「國內電報營業通則」一種，印就單行本，連同另印之國內電報價目表通令分發各電局，飭自本年九月一日起實行。此項單行本，隨時可向各電局及各郵局內電報收發處索閱，不取分文。</p>
<p>國內電報營業通則，旣係依據上述各種辦法章規編印，其內容，已將原有各種關於收發電報之辦法章規，鎔於一爐，成爲一種有系統之章則，俾公衆可依照新通則內各項規定，交發電報，電局收發員亦可依據新通則爲接受電報之準繩。嗣後收發報人與電局收發員之間，旣有一種共同遵守之通則，當可避免一切無謂爭執。新通則大體雖仍沿照向章編訂，但較前改訂之處，亦復不少，茲扼要列舉如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於電報書法者；（甲）向例發報人自譯之華文明語私務電報，祇須將電碼繕於去電紙上，卽可送交電局拍發。現在新通則內規定華文電報，除收報地名外，應由發報人將所書文字逐字譯註電碼，（華文明語私務電報，不得僅書電碼而無文字）以便收發員收下後交由譯電員代爲校對有無錯誤。但願將華文明語電報交電局代譯者，可由電局代爲譯註電碼。（乙）新通則內規定代替華文電報住址之電話號碼及郵箱號數，均須書於括弧之內。例如（一）南京話（三一一三一）王良，（二）靑島郵箱（二七五）黃永孚。又關於話傳華文電報之書寫格式，新通則內規定如下：TF南京（三一一三一）王良。上項書寫格式之規定，均較前略有變史。（丙）關於華文明語銀行電報內密碼號字及表示發電日期及號數之阿拉伯數目字之書寫方法，新通則內規定必須書於括弧之內，並於其後各加一「號」字。但中間並無其他文字或數目間隔者，祇須於第二括弧之後，加一「號」字，例如（九七一七）（一六〇一）號。故此項密碼對號字及表示發電日期及號數之阿拉伯數目字，以連續書寫爲合算，可省去一「號」字之報費。（丁）新通則內規定華文電報之住址及電文內，亦可夾用少數洋文字母或字句，標點符號，括弧，分數式斜劃及商務標識。此項規定爲舊章所無，對於發報人自有不少便利之處也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 驥良</p>
<p>整理電政又一新猷</p>
<p>自各通商大埠電報局，設置業務稽查員以來，成績卓著，頗獲外界之好感，電信業務，因之發展，惟業務稽查員之設置，僅及於少數通商大埠之電局，範圍不廣，當局本有加派稽查員，對於各地電局作普遍稽查之計劃，但爲人力財力所限，迄未能實現，卽已設稽查員各局亦以人數不多，仍未免稽查不週之處。因此，特訂電報業務通信稽查片辦法一種，以圖補救，其辦法係用明信片印製甲乙兩種稽查片，內列一切查詢事項，由各地電報局及電政司，寄請收發報人塡註，塡妥後寄回，由各該機關主管人員，加以審核，如其中查有電報稽延錯誤，及其他不符情事，視其情節之輕重，將經手人員，予以相當懲處。甲種稽查來報，卽係收報人所收到他人發來之電報，乙種稽查去報，卽係發報人發給他人之電報。（此項稽查片，電政司及各局均有，函索卽寄）</p>
<p>該辦法已由該部通令各電報局於本日起實行。凡每月來去報在一千通以上之電局，每月應塡發稽查片五十次，五千通以上者，塡發一百二十五次，一萬通以上者，塡發二百五十次，三萬通以上者，塡發五百次，除由各局依照上項規定塡發外，另由電政司隨時抽查，以資週密。至每月來去報不滿一千通之局通信稽查事務，則由電政司直接辦理，此辦法實行後，電報業務稽查範圍擴大，其意義一面固使電局人員，辦事益加動謹，一面電政當局，得明瞭各地電局辦理成績之優劣，及外界對於電局之觀戚，以資參考，而便改進。惟此事非單方努力所能奏效，仍有望於各界收發報人，予以協助，庶可進行順利，而收合作之效。茲將關於塡復稽查片之重要數點，提示如左，務請各界人士一注意及之。</p>
<p>（一）稽查片收到後，務請卽日一一詳實塡復，交郵寄回。</p>
<p>（二）稽查片內所列各項，除註明「由司塡註」或「由局塡註」者外，均請由收發報人填註。</p>
<p>（三）塡註時，請騐明塡註之電報，是否則電司或電局所註之號數日期等相符</p>
<p>（四）電文如有錯誤，請註明何字錯誤，又報差如有需索酒資，或來報譯費情事，並請註明給予銀數，以便查究。</p>
<p>（五）收發報人，對於電局業務及一切措施，如有任何意見，或不滿情事，均可於該片內以不客氣之態度，爽直說明，以供電政當局之改進。</p>

<p>— 德玖</p>
<p>——敬告發報人——</p>
<p>交通部有無綫電之合併，每天讀報的人們，是誰都知道的。但一般發報人對於有無綫電的如何聯絡，它的功能怎樣，也許還很隔膜吧？</p>
<p>在上海因爲交通大厦尙未建築以前，所以有無綫電報房仍舊是分設着。常見一般發報人以爲到四馬路總收發處拍發的電報一定是有綫電，而到民國路收發處拍發的電報一定是無綫電，那是錯了。無論是總收發處，分收發處，郵局收報處，統統是有無綫國內國際，概行兼收的。所以你跑到從前的無綫電臺，儘可拍發有綫電報，反之，你跑到從前的電報總局，也儘可以拍發無綫電報。</p>
<p>自從有無綫電合併以來，電報的速率提高不少，更顯出有無綫電相輔而行的功能來。電局收下一張電報，當卽交最快速的電路發出。譬如一個地方，同時設有無綫，也設有有綫，那就得交何者爲快的電路拍發。所以發報人是不必去指定用有綫或無綫拍發的。</p>
<p>發報人對於某一電路的傳遞速率，通暢與否，當然不能十分確切知道的。有時有綫電發生綫路障碍了，有時無綫電發生干擾了，那更非發報人所能想像得到的。所以爲謀發報人的福利起見，儘可不必指定電路，一任電局權衡辦理好了。電局當能予以快速的確切保障。</p>
<p>譬如從上海發往南京，姻臺，靑島，在先是有無綫電路都有的，但最近爲了有綫電路的快速通暢，就把無綫電路取消了。一般發報人有時發電每多依奮註着「由無綫電拍發」。這樣就叫收報員非常爲難了。假如照收下來，發交了無綫報房，而無綫報房依舊要拍交有綫報房發出，非但多費一番手績，還要多躭擱不少時間。有時遇到固執的發報人，他會不相信你的話，忽忽的趕去民國路收發處去拍發，以爲在從前的無綫電臺去發電，那準是無綫電了。豈知結果依舊要從無綫報房轉到有綫報房拍發的。</p>
<p>反之，有時無綫電有直達的電路，而有綫電呢，要經過三數個局子的轉遞，那當然應該拍無綫電了。然而發報人却偏偏要由有綫電拍發，因此會躭誤時間，這豈不是寃枉嗎？</p>
<p>自從省費新章實行後，發報人便利不少。址姓名十五個字，只收五個字費，這樣，發報人可以把地址人名寫得很淸楚了。從前因省費而省略字數，以致電報送不出的弊病可以免掉。但現在也有些小毛病，有時因爲地址的字數太多，已逾十五字，於是把各字就省略了，也有的竟把姓也一古腦兒省掉了。於是在投送時就容易發生錯誤。像上海，一所房子住的三四家，七八家，甚至十廿家，叫報差怎樣投送呢？也有的把地點寫得疊床架屋，非但傳遞時費時費料，而且反易弄錯。譬如打張電報到「南京建康路二號王誠」照上面寫法一定可以打到了。而發報人因爲多寫幾個字也是一樣價錢，於是再加上「央子廟奇望街』六字成爲「南京建康路夫子廟奇望街二號王誠」。發報人的意思，以地點越詳細越好，但是叫收報局交差投送時不免要弄錯了。省費新章地址人名十五個字作五個字收費，不是叫發報人一定要凑足十五個字！只要地址淸楚，不必再疊床架屋了！</p>
<p>最後總括地來告訴發報人一些門檻：</p>
<p>（一）國內電報無論發往何處，無論交什麽地方拍發，都可以不必註明「由有綫」或「由無綫」拍發。電局收下電報後當卽由最快速之電路發出。</p>
<p>（二）惟國際電報，請註Via　Cgra必能獲得最快速與準確的結果。</p>
<p>（三）地址人名但求淸楚卽好，不必疊床架屋了反而容易錯誤。</p>

<p>再次談到無綫電，無綫電的應用超短波，而能轉輸闊帶週波率的，每年均有進展，新機械的設備，曾在英法兩國間，用單通信路的超短波商用無綫電射光機（Micro－Ray）以一千七百兆週波（波長約合二生的米突），作跨越英倫海峽的試騐，極得美滿的成績，再在九個通信路的無綫電話回路上，用一百兆週波試騐，亦有良好的成績，後者更可爲日後開發多信路商用無綫電話的先聲。</p>
<p>英國的勃立斯得爾海峽（Bristol　Channel）兩岸，其陸地電話網中，現裝置超短波無綫電話，作爲有無綫電話連絡。在德國基納賽（Guernsey）與歇夫次堡（Shaftsburg）兩地——距離一百十英里——更有通信回路一組，所用波長爲五公尺。此種類短電波的進於實用，可使普通的無綫電，功效漸見薄弱，故現在各國陸綫電話中，其趨勢多有在兩端加裝短波的無綫電話，去增加通信的效率</p>
<p>航空飛機的無綫電設備，最近各國的趨勢，大都有飛機上裝置自動式收發的機械。無綫電機之用作引導飛機在大霧中盲目降陸的，業經各國航空站，普遍的採用，如德國的登不爾霍夫（Tempelhot）及瑞士的叙列克（Zurich）兩地，卽其一例。自動式飛機尋向機（Automatic　Directicn　Finder）現已發明，在上年十一月間，法京所開的國際航空機展覽會，已有陳列。在陸地上此種尋向機，能較準飛機夜航的錯誤，實較他種機器爲優。再有一種航空無綫電，使用短天綫，高週變壓器（R．F．Transformer），鉛裏高週傳輸綫（Lead　Covered　R．F．Transmission　Lines）等的，亦已發明。（待續）</p>

<h3 id="c229">盔頭業 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 小月英女士</p>
<p>因近趣年來平劇沒落的結果而受影響最大者要算是其附業「盔頭」業了。平劇班中的行頭，除戲衣而外，就要算「盔頭」佔重要部份；可是牠的名目之多，却較戲衣「猶有過之」。據盔頭作中的人說：全份大小「盔頭」約有千餘種左右，若拏細目及各種零件合併起來，就有三千種之多。</p>
<p>「盔頭」業全盛時代是在遜淸咸豐年問，那時「盔頭」全份價值最低的需五百元上下，高者則幾十萬兩亦很尋常，所以當時「灰頭」作幾乎沒有一家不是利市三倍的。可是「好夢易醒」似乎已成了不變的公例；到了現在，平劇遭受了時代的擯斥，「盔頭」業也就因之走上灰色的境地了。在北平的「盔頭」作，由四十多家逐漸减到祇有十多家，而這十多家「盔頭」作又由於平劇的中心移到了上海，因此愈益不能維持。當北平的「盔頭」作遭到不景氣時，正是上海的「盔頭」作發達的開端：因爲在清祚告終之後，故都的名角都紛紛南下演唱，所有戲中行頭的製辦，都就近求之於上海了。</p>
<p>在上海朋設「盔頭」作最早的是次津班，不過那時祇有二三家專製「盔頭」供給戲班上的需要，其餘幾家大都把「盔頭」當作副業。此後因了上海舞台事業的發達，實際需要逐步擴大，一般平日祇製口面——鬍鬚——和燈鋪的都改爲專製「盔頭」了。於是上海「盔頭」作便由二三家增至十六七家，業「盔頭」的人也從這時分成了津蘇兩班了。這兩班「盔頭」作，除製盔頭外，大多數還兼製「行頭」——戲衣——和各種零件：他們各有專長，津班以善製「盔頭蒙子」著稱，蘇班則以工於刺繡成名。最近最出名的「盔頭」作，有柳恒昌等十多家，其次如城隍廟裏的幾家，因爲地點關係，就很少有人知道了。這十多家「盔頭」作能製的全部盔頭和軟巾零件，據調查約有這幾種：大過橋，小過橋，女套翹，金蓮花冠，銀蓮花冠，金銀宛子盔，黃白火龍冠，鬼頭額子，女火熖，平頂冠，扎巾火熖，扎巾金銀套翹，金銀中心紗套翹，金銀魚翹罩，荷葉片學士盔，中心紗帽，中心紗翠翹，元紗帽，金爵翹，沙錫片，皂隸帽，書隸帽，翠鴨片巾，花茨姑棄，五佛冠，觀音斗，金銀鴨蛋冠，土地臉子，加官臉子，雷公臉子，懶梳妝，記祖髮，綠神帽，壽星冠，八戒嘴，喜神，黑小老爺帽，金銀荷葉盔，金銀二郎盔，八面威，獅子盔，黑白黃虎頭盔，老旦鳳，金銀都司額。以上是盔，帽，冠一部份的詳細名目，此外還有許多希奇古怪的盔冠之類的名稱，就是一般業盔者，沒有藍本一時也還是說不出的。就這幾種盔頭的價值而論，有值一二元的，也有值百多元的，最好的盔頭，除了外觀的製工細膩，還要使「盔頭蒙子」不易破裂變色。「盔頭蒙子」大都係用「冷布」做的，但此種「蒙子」易於塌陷破碎：所以那些價值較高的盔頭大多用銅質做「蒙子」，旣不易破碎，又不會翻變顏色，這類的盔頭起碼要三五十元才可以辦到。</p>
<p>開設一爿「盔頭」作的資本，據說是沒有一定的，三五百元是一爿盔頭作，幾千元也是一爿盔頭作；資本大小雖有那麽多的懸殊，但無論在外觀或實質上都不易分出誰的資本的多少來，這也是盔頭業比別種行業神秘的地方。一爿盔頭作的日常朋銷，大槪都很容易算得出的，牠除日常必需的房租，火食，電燈費和別的商店一樣之外，人工方面都是照貨算錢，老闆可不必負担閒時的工資。普通的盔頭作，必需的工人大槪是三五個人到十多人不箏，最多的也不過二十人；他們是各有專藝，彼此分工合作的。製一頂盔頭所需的手績，一般的說來約需五六人，特別簡單和麻煩的例外。他們的手藝可分爲做「蒙子」，「勒子」，「穿料」，「打纓子」，「製帽箱」這幾種；特別麻煩的「盔頭」，這幾種工人就一個也不能少的，反之，特別簡單的「盔頭」，就是只有一個人也可以完工。</p>
<p>一個盔頭工人生活的好壞，全視他平藝程度的高低如何而定；照普通的慣例，老闆對他們的待遇，除了供給膳街而外，就是看他的手藝的類別而規定工資。總括的說來，無論那一類工人的每月所入，最高的不會趙過廿元，少的僅七八元，但老闆賺錢的基礎大部份還是</p>

<p>建築在一般「半師半徒」的學徒身上。盔頭作的學徒，照例是比普通商店要多一年，在這期問，學徒不但沒有津貼可得，而且進店時還要帶一筆拜師錢來的：不過這幾年因了盔頭業的不振，學這種手藝的人也少了許多，一班老闆才把這筆拜師錢取消了。</p>

<h3 id="c230">讀最近幾期的「女聲」 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 幼斌</p>
<p>—四馬路二八六號發行，每冊定價四分！</p>
<p>近幾年來，中國的婦女運動似乎很消沈；專門談論婦女問題的刋物也好像不很多。因此就有人說「娘兒們」出風頭的日子已隨着「五四」「五卅」時代過去了。但是，後來，由於偉大的時代的啟示，那些幾乎是不爲人所注意的婦女問題，終於又復一一在我們今日的議事”程中提出來了。就在這樣的情形下，使我注意到了流行於出版界中的許多婦女刊物：「婦女共鳴」，「女靑年半月刋」，「女子月刊」，「女聲」，「婦女生活」。然而，在這些婦女刊物中，其各自的讀者對象也很不同，如「婦女共鳴」等，便是婆婆媽媽太太奶奶們的讀物，而「女聲」則是以認眞生活的靑年男女爲其讀者對象的。因此，它們的內容也就有本質上的不同了。</p>
<p>現在，我所要向讀者諸君介紹的，便是最近幾期的「女聲」。</p>
<p>首先，我覺得「女聲」很能注意與婦女問題有關的一切社會現象，而且還能及時地與以正確的評判。如十三期碧梧的「取締男女同學」，便是針對着北平當局的取締男女同學說話的；十四期羅瓊的「逃出「救濟」的牢籠」「依據現實的事實，揭破了「婦女救濟院」等虛偽的「慈善」而具：十六期伊蔚的「從「呌賣」「出租」到「公開擇配」，對於當塗婦女被挑在筐子里沿途叫賣的事情，對於貴州地痞出租婦女的勾當，對於慈善團體舉行少女公開擇配的現象，都給與了適當的評判。因爲「女聲」能及時地抓住這些現實問題來討論，所以其內容便很有生氣了。</p>
<p>「女聲」很注意政治經濟的問題，有時候也刋載學術理論的文字。關於前者，如向芸的「德國重整軍備與歐洲局勢」（第十三期），施芸的「中國的金融恐慌」（十四期），「法國政局的動盪」（十五期），「法德兩國的海軍恊定」（十六期）；關於後者的，如十三期袖羣的「認識與行動」（哲學講話）便是。這些文字都是以通俗的形式寫出來的，即使是對政治經濟問題無深刻研究者，卽使是沒有淵博的哲學知識老，看了這些文字後，也可以了解其內容。同時，我還要說，「女聲」之能刊載關於政治經濟以及學術理論的文章，還是它的一個特點。國內有些婦女刋物，往往抱着婦女不管政治經濟問題？不研究學術的成見，都不刋載這類文章；如果有人問這些刊物的編者這是什麼原因時，他們都會說那是因爲一般婦女讀者不看這類文章的緣故。其實這種表現乃是「女子無才便是德」這個舊觀念的發展。試問婦女爲什麼不應有關於國際國內的政治經濟的知能呢？爲什麽她們不應研究學術，獲得必需的知識呢？如果人們不贊成「女子無才便是德」的理論，那就應該在一般婦女刋物上刊載那類文章；卽使在初刋時不能得到一般婦女讀者歡迎，那列物的編者和作者也該負起責任來，設法引導她們去閱讀那類文章，使她們能獲得關於政治經濟的，關於各種學術的有用的知識。</p>
<p>至於缺點，「女聲」也是有的。如關於婦女生活與土方通訊等軟性文章的缺乏生氣，缺乏描寫的力，不生動，不活潑；如有些批評別人意見的文章的中心意識不明顯，缺少戰鬥的力量？缺少潑刺和積極的精神；如封面的平凡；這些都是「女聲」的主要缺點。有人說「女聲」太愛批評人，甚至說它太愛罵人，但在我看來，「女聲」批評人還太客氣了，因之减少了牠的積極精神。我以爲像「女聲」那樣的小型刋物，對於應該批評的人，便應無情地批判，對於應該「責罵」的人也當不客氣地「責罵」，因爲要這樣才能更明白地把眞理與謬誤的面貌顯示出來，也才能更有力地激發一般讀者的心情，而「女聲」也才能更加顯示出它的力量！</p>
<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3 id="c231">圍棋國手顧水如訪問記 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 張劍心</p>
<p>圍棋爲我國古代藝術之一種，起源在那一時代已不可考，但據一般人的傳說，說是始於唐堯時代，那末，牠的歷史是足有三千多年了。在唐朝初年的時候，日本太子某，慕中國圍棋聖手顧師言名，渡海來學，圍棋遂東渡傳至日本，及至今日，反已靑出於藍而勝於藍了。</p>
<p>圍棋在淸初，因爲朝野極力提倡，故當時名手輩出，可說是圍棋的全盛時代，當時名手施襄夏，范西屏，程蘭如，梁魏今四人，人稱四傑。及至乾嘉時代，名手過伯齡，盛大有，黃龍士，周懶予，徐星友等均以圍棋著名於世，而其中尤推黃龍士爲傑出。至民國以還，則以提倡無人，致圍棋的研究日趨衰落，圍棋名手也逐漸减少，到了現在，恐怕只有顧水如先生要算是其中的俊俊者了。</p>
<p>據說上海棋社就是由顧先生主其事的。因爲棋社緊鄰我的家，所以就在一個下午，乘着空暇機會去參觀一下。</p>
<p>上海棋社是一所二樓二底的房子，牠的西廂房，便是下棋的塲所。當我走到那裏的時候，正有幾對在那裏下着。天是那麼的熱，屋子裏雖然有電風扇不斷地扇着，但是還像鴨子放在蒸籠一般地熬出油來。他們有的赤着膊，有的做僅地穿着」件汗衫，雖然額角上的汗一顆一顆地在淌着，但在他們却是滿不在乎的。他們全神貫注在棋盤上，黑子白子一子子地仰着。時間是走得挺快的，雖然三四個鐘點已經過去了，但他們還是在下着，每動一子，總要思索了半响之後才動手，所以一局棋是常常有下那麽二三天纔能結束的。</p>
<p>顧水如先生是一個四十開外的人了，他的樣子眞像許世英先生，就不過兩頰比較許先生開闊些。當我走到他們樓上的時候，他正在哼着昆曲，怪有味兒地。當他哼完了崑曲之後，纔慢慢地把話匣子放開來了。</p>
<p>「這幾天像是陰凉了些啦。」是楓涇口音。</p>
<p>「是，」我答着，「這幾天忙吧？一</p>
<p>「沒有事，只天天下下棋。」他笑了。</p>
<p>「日本人分別圍棋名手的程度爲幾段幾段，那末，我們中國有資格够得上段的有幾個人？一</p>
<p>「那很多的，現在圍棋名手付劉棣懷，張澹如，魏海鴻，雷溥華等好幾個人呢，而最傑出的，要算是神童吳淸源了。」</p>
<p>「這些人，你都跟他們下過嗎？」</p>
<p>「祇有張澹如沒有會過手，其他全會過手的。劉棣懷，魏海鴻，雷溥萬等，他們總得要我讓他二三子纔能下個平局，他們的技藝在日本可以稱到三段。吳淸源那孩子就是我的乾兒子。」他說到這裏，臉上顯出得意的樣子，繼續說道：「他從小就有下棋的天才，他的父親是前北京高等法院推事，他的外祖張元奇，曾任奉天省長，因爲都能下圍棋，所以他從小就有學圍棋的環境。可是，他很早就死了父親，在十歲的那年，因爲朋友的介紹，就過寄與我。那時他小小的身體，跟我下棋的時候，總是站在凳子上的。我跟他下棋，總是讓他五子。他天天這樣用功地學着，到十一歲的時候，就能跟劉棣懷，雷溥華等下個平手。這樣一個天才畢竟是少有的。後來他爲了學技，就在三四年前，由一個日使館的領事介紹給日本資本家大倉喜七郞，更由大倉的介紹，加入日本棋院。他的程度在他初進去的時候是三段，現在已經升到六段了，但他實在的本領大約是在六段一二以上。」</p>
<p>「圍拱這門藝術在我國已有三千年的歷史了，爲什麽近來日見退步呢？」</p>
<p>「我决不相信中國人有不如他國人的，今人有不如古人的，因爲古人和他國人的能力均載在棋譜，我們祇要跟着去研究就可以盡得其能，我們有我們的能力，若再去加以研究，這樣今人便勝如古人，中國人便勝如他國人了。我國圍棋自唐初傳至日本後，日本軍人以爲圍棋暗寓軍事學，其進退攻守悉如作戰，故軍人均能悉心研究，政府當局亦能大事提倡。日本棋院的基本金目前已達二千萬金，當這棋院創設時，大倉喜七郞即助基金五十萬元，於此足見日人愛護圍棋的熱情了。日本國境內因爲禁止不正當的娛樂，故白常消遣即以圍棋爲之，因此家喻衣曉，日人之能下圍棋者幾佔全國人口十分之六七。</p>
<p>「日本報紙均有圍棋專刋，他們報館裏常請六段與七段名手對奕，其薪水以一局計，六段爲六十元，七段爲七十元，每局常下至八小時至十二小時，每日僅下四小時，故一局的勝負常在二三日之間。奕畢後，更請九段名手本因坊秀哉講評，其講評費爲一百元，故日報一局圍棋之費，當在三百元之譜。該項奕祺情形更按日登載於報上。九段名手本因坊秀哉在日本棋院的薪水，每月有三千元，此外講評所入，尙不在內。</p>
<p>「以前我在天津的時候，那裏有一個商報，因爲主筆是我們朋友，所以我就替他們闢一個圍棋欄，專門講評奕棋情形，商報銷路頓時增加有一千多份。在那時我曾經把定戶的籍貫加以統計，結果以浙江及平津人爲最多，兩湖次之，內地如川粵桂閩等地僅佔少數。本埠新夜報上現亦闢有圍棋欄，爲本社社友所編，他們也曾要求過我，替他們講評，我因爲講評是挺麻煩而最傷精神的事情，同時，又不能像文章下註解那麽容易，所以沒有答應。」</p>
<p>「那末，在中國圍棋界中要算是誰的本領最高？同時與日本比較起來怎樣？」我進一步地問。</p>
<p>「這個，」他笑着把頭搖了「搖，又抽了一口烟說，「在中國圍棋界中，所有的名手，大致我都和他們會過手，除了吳淸源之外，我從沒有失敗過一次。也許，隱者逸土中，尙有高手，但我也沒有耳聞過。在日本的時候，我和六段七段的名手也曾會過，也是窺的時候多，輸的時候少。不過，他們說我只有五段程度，要是我們跟他們比較，我想，在目前我們也許還不能如人吧？」</p>
<p>這時，他的太太很客氣的開了一個浜瓜，於是彼此便咀嚼起來，而結束了這一段談話。</p>

<p>— 仲可</p>
<p>黃金是向來就被人珍貴的一種金屬。遠在若干年以前，那些文明古國就巴用黃金做裝飾品和器具了。現在我們還可見到古代埃及，巴比倫，中國的金製品。在我們所發掘出來的許多古物中，不是有許多是金製成的嗎？由此可見人類之利用黃金，珍貴黃金，實在是自古就是如此的。</p>
<p>但是，埋藏在世界各地的黃金之被大大地發掘出來，乃是近世的事情。就在前一世紀的中葉，全世界一年的金產額，其總數亦不過一〇〇〇至三〇〇〇萬元，及至一八四八年加利弗尼亞金地發現，與一八五一年澳洲東部的金被人知道後，世界金產額才得大大地增加，待到一八五三年時，世界金產額已超過一億五千萬圓了。</p>
<p>然而，這時所產的金，主要的還是砂金，此種砂金經過一些時日就漸漸地快被採盡了，到一八七〇年代時，產額就降到了一千萬元。一八八六年新的製鍊法發明以後，金產額又才逐漸增加；特別是由於一八八五年南非的金產之被發現，金產額才得開始躍進。一八九九年，世界金產額巳超過三億一千萬了，及至一九一〇年時，更造成了四億五千萬的紀錄，至於近年來的數目字的昇降，也是在四億萬元左右盤旋的。</p>
<p>這些金產的一半主要是由非洲南部所產；其餘的一半則產自亞洲，美洲等地，主要可說是產自圍繞着太平洋的諸國家。據近年的調查，世界各國的金產額大體如下：</p>
<p>億　萬圓　％</p>
<p>南非聯邦　二、二一六〇　五三·三</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>羅德卡　一一三一　二·七</p>
<p>其他非洲地帶　九九九　二·四</p>
<p>加拿大　四三五六　一〇·五</p>
<p>美國　四二四五　一〇·二</p>
<p>墨西哥　一三八三　三·三</p>
<p>南美　九五〇　二·二</p>
<p>中美　　一〇〇　〇·三</p>
<p>俄國　二一〇〇　五·〇</p>
<p>澳洲　一〇四三　二·五</p>
<p>紐西蘭　二九一　〇·七</p>
<p>日本　九八五　二·四</p>
<p>英領印度　六八〇　一·四</p>
<p>菲律賓　三七〇　〇·九</p>
<p>荷領東印度　二二〇　〇·五</p>
<p>中國　二〇〇　〇·五</p>
<p>歐洲　三五〇　〇·九</p>
<p>合計　四·一五·六四一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>依據上表，則是全數的五九·四％是由非洲一洲產出，二五·五％是由北美產出，一五％是由俄國西伯利亞及亞洲產出，其餘者則爲歐洲，澳洲，南美，等地所產。在這中間的南非聯邦，加拿大，澳洲，紐西蘭，印度以及非洲西部都是英國的屬地，所以英國是獨佔了世界金產額的百分之七十三，其年產額是在三億萬圓以上。其次是美國及菲律賓，年產額爲四六一五萬圓，佔世界金產額的一一·％。再次則爲俄國與墨西哥等。</p>
<p>英領諸產金地的產量現在還有日益增加的趨勢，其中的南非聯邦之德蘭士瓦，卽佔世界金產額的半數以上，現在還保存着發展的趨勢。至於加拿大，則其發展的趨勢尤足驚人。在前世紀之末，界於阿拉斯加的克倫當發見砂金的賓庫後，加拿大的金產額已佔有了世界的第三位；及至在文他利州的太古的地層中發見許多金鑛脈時，其年產額更是很快地達到了四千三四百萬元，超過美國而居世界第二位了。同時，加拿大的大部分還是沒有人姻的處女地，新的金鑛之被發見還有很多的機會，是則其前途將不可限量了。此外如印度，紐西蘭等地的金產，雖現在尙未引起人們的極大注意，但也是很有希望的。</p>
<p>在前世紀之中葉，美國的金產額是獲有最高榮譽的。但自德蘭士瓦大金山出現後，牠便不能保存其最高地位了。在產額方面，一九零九年美國產金九九六七寓元，可說是金產額的最高紀錄，但此後就逐漸低下了。及至一九三二年時，美國金產總額雖尙有四六零零萬元，但其中之三七零萬元爲菲律賓羣島所產，八一六萬元爲阿拉斯加所產，由美國本國生產者只有三四零零萬元。於此美個金產之衰落趨勢便可槪見了。</p>
<p>在美國西部的金產地之南，便是墨西哥的產金地帶。這裏出產的金主要是由金銀鑛膁中得來。在銀方面，其年產在一億盎斯以上，佔世界金產額的百分之四十，居第一位：至於金的產額，每年達一四零零萬元，居世界第五位。至其將來的發展，現尙不能預測。</p>
<p>娥國的金產近年也有增加，其年產額已在二千萬元以上，居世界第四位。而且，現產的金大半都是西伯利亞方面的砂金，此外在那些人跡稀少的地方還埋藏着豐富的金鑛，直到而今尙未開發出來，且還不知道其產量究竟有多少，所以我們可以斷定俄國金產的前途是更要光明的。</p>
<p>至於歐洲，除俄國之外，其他地方產金實少。就是佔有德蘭西弗尼亞金山地帶的羅馬尼亞，其年產也未能過三五零萬元。此外如獨佔世界金產額的百分之七十三的英國，其本國的金產每年僅三五零元，還沒有一個歐美的勞慟者每年所收入的那樣的多。</p>
<p>黃金的產地以及佔有這些產地的國家，已如上述。但現在有有黃金最多的國家却不是佔有主要出產黃金地的國家。事實上，英國雖是佔有了世界金產額的百分之七十三，但牠却不是黃金的最多儲存者；現在世界上存有黃金最多的，第一是美國，第二是法國。</p>
<p>但是，美國和法國雖擁有大量的黃金，然其人民中之失業窮困者却非常之多，因而企圖刦掠那些黃金的也大有人在。所以，巴黎紐約等地的黃金在平時是以堅固完善的工程保護着的！一旦運輸黃金，那什麼警察，鑣客，偵探，電話偵探等便都要一齊動員，其形勢比在最嚴重的時期保護什麽要人都要嚴重。然而，使人意想不到的，在紐約等地仍有刦金的事情發生。由此可見：黃金這東西，因爲在現今的世界中太貴太有用了，所以就在槍口之下也有人敢於冒險去刦掠的。</p>

<h3 id="c233">姐姐的婚事 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 陳數旬</p>
<p>姐姐快要「出閣」了。陪嫁的東西，在三個月前便預備妥當。爸爸很得意的一手撚鬍鬚，一手指着妝奩對姐姐說：「香兒，你看這些東西那樣不好？誰家嫁女有我這樣捨得？你要爭氣啦！」</p>
<p>姐姐輕輕的垂下頸兒，耳根都紅透了。其實不單爸爸自己誇獎，隣居也很稱譜：</p>
<p>「二公這次打發大姑娘，眞捨得啦！單說嫁妝也值千多洋錢，——衣服有有十多件細的，手飾還有黃貨呢！」</p>
<p>「是啦！也要他家纔辦得起，據說男家也很有錢呢。」</p>
<p>「誰說不？出了名的張大戶。可是——據說女婿有點殘廢，可惜大姑娘那副才貌………」</p>
<p>「那有什末辦法？他們原是指腹爲婚的啦！」</p>
<p>妝奩旣是這麼豐美，可是仍沒有引起妣姐的快樂；她每天都是愁着臉兒，橫躺在床上輕輕嘆息。有時也拿起那本叫「斷腸詞」的書慢慢兒翻閱，可是不久眼圈兒便有些紅潤，終於滴下淚珠了！我每次見着這情形，總要安慰似的問她：「香姐，幹嗎又哭呢？」</p>
<p>「沒有哭啦」！她一壁揩眼睛，一壁辯護，「弟弟乖不要給媽媽說啦！」</p>
<p>於是她輕輕的把我抱在懷里，一種最親愛的口吻：「弟弟昨兒敎你的那幾個字，記得了嗎？」</p>
<p>我故意搖着頭兒。她半信半疑的翻開書，伸着細長而圓潤的食指，指着書上的字，悄悄的敎給我：「去年元夜時，花市燈如畫，月上柳梢頭，人約黃昏後，……」</p>
<p>不等她讀完，我便「嗤」的一聲笑了，於是她輕輕的軋我的肢窩，含笑的說：「小傻瓜！又騙人啦！」</p>
<p>這麽簡單的玩笑一會，總是她先收拾了笑容。我常常都想引起她大笑一陣，可是最多祗得着一絲絲的笑意。我那小小的心靈中不免有些猜想：「姐姐有什末心事呢？」老早就想把她背着人哭的情形去告訴媽媽，可是又怕她惱我。我愛姐姐，勝過愛媽媽呵！</p>
<p>喜期的頭下午，男家「過禮」的到來了。「吹打」的聲音時而激昂，時而凄厲，我的心都給牠弄得十分酸痛了！</p>
<p>姐姐的臉色越發憂愁，精神更顯得疲憊。表姐們圍着她，七嘴八舌的：</p>
<p>「香姐，你怎麽不開心啦？明兒晚上就要……」</p>
<p>「假裝的！她心里快活呢」</p>
<p>「不！你看香姐多瘦，險蛋兒也沒血色。」</p>
<p>「她在害相思病啦！……」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>表姐們都笑得變腰打滾了。姐姐的臉兒忽然泛起紅霞，似哭似笑的，想說話又沒有說出，終於眼圈兒潮潤，一下伏在枕上了。表姐們有的表示驚異，有的難爲情樣退到旁邊，互相埋怨說：</p>
<p>「你的玩笑太開得厲害了。別人心里正難過哩！」</p>
<p>「誰？你不先說趣話，我怎會，——反正不是有意………」</p>
<p>「雖不是有意，但別人——據說新姐夫是個……」說話的向姐姐那邊一望，忽然咽住了。</p>
<p>第二天，打早就「發親」，姐姐頭上披的「喜帕」，身上穿的「喜衣」，脚上穿的「喜鞋」，全身上下都是紅亮亮的。養娘和二嬸扶着她下樓，走進神堂，她過身都在發抖，胸口一張一弛的，好似哭泣得很厲害，抽咽得很厲害，可是臉兒給「喜帕」遮住，看不大淸楚。這時「花轎」伴在神堂外的階沿邊，「吹鼓手」起勁的吹，起勁的打，好似一下就要把姐姐奪去一樣！</p>
<p>姐姐在二嬸和養娘攙扶下，參拜了泥塑的祖宗，拜別了在生的父母，禁不住一陣大聲的哭泣，全身都像軟灘了。二嬸和麥娘很吃勁的，把她扶出神堂。好容易攙進花轎。於是「吹鼓手」特別賣勁的一陣猛吹，一陣猛打——在那吹，打的急鬧中，花轎抬走了，姐姐的哭聲漸漸嘶啞了！</p>
<p>「同門」那一天。轎了還在村路上，小朋友們就嚷着：「看新郎啦！」「看新姐夫啦！」於是表姐們，表嫂們，蜂湧的擠到樓窗邊，年老的女人和男客，都猥在神堂外的街沿上。我也很興奮的擠在人中間，心里元自的想：「新姐夫像個什末樣兒啦」！一會兒轎子到門了，二嬸和養娘迎着頭一頂姐姐坐的轎子，把她扶進了神堂。第二頂就急新姐夫的，剛擱在階沿口，我心里就撲通撲通的亂跳：「什末模樣啦！」但馬上轉念：「該好吧！」可是「大紅葉」跟即掀開轎簾，牽出一個又黑，又矮，走路一拐一跛的殘廢人，我禁不住全身一次寒噤，心里氣忿的駡：「是個什末怪物啦！」這時客人中有驚異聲，樓窗邊有嗤笑聲，我的臉上火燒一般熱，心里針刺那麽痛！</p>
<p>「會兒磬聲響了，如姐同那怪物並排兒站在紅氈上，參拜祖宗，拜謝父母……。姐姐比他高過一個頭兒，他站在姐姐旁邊眞令人又氣又惱，他那麽醜陋，據說還有些傻，那裏配得上姐姐的漂亮？而且她還會做詩，描畫呢。我心里埋怨極了——埋怨爸爸媽媽幹嗎不給姐姐找個好姐夫！</p>
<p>儀式纔告完畢，那怪物便連着打呵欠，流鼻涕，站不件，坐不穩，親戚們都以爲他生了病，可是大紅葉趕忙吩咐預備姻燈，說是他的「癮」來了！這時親戚們大都悄悄的議論着：</p>
<p>「怎麽還有嗜好啦！」</p>
<p>「有錢人家的子弟，誰不是這樣！」</p>
<p>姐姐給人扶進了後廂房，表姐們都親熱的向她問訊。。</p>
<p>「香姐，你吃飯不？餓吧」</p>
<p>「瘦啦！你生病嗎？」</p>
<p>姐組苦笑的搖搖頭，臉兒慘白，眼睛落了神，以前的活潑，美麗，消失得很多了！</p>
<p>不久媽媽進來，剛喊了一聲「孩子」，姐姐便一下撲在她懷裏，哇的一聲哭起來了，好像有無限的委曲，無限的苦痛，都在這哭泣中。媽媽一壁給她揩眼淚，自己也忍不住洒下幾滴淚水，許久許久纔哽咽的說：「孩子，不，不要傷傷心，祇要有吃有有穿……」</p>
<p>姐姐更哭的厲害了。這時表姐們都同情的愁苦着臉，有的還在洒淚呢！</p>
<p>第二天該回男家了。姐姐死也不肯下樓，轎子在外面等，那怪物已經鑽進轎子了。媽媽愈勸，姐姐俞哭，臉上身上全是淚痕，頭髮已弄散了！爸爸在樓下理了幾次，都沒有生效，最後實在忍不住，纔跑上樓來，他把表姐們喊開了，纔板起面孔對姐姐說：「你讀過那麽多書啦，連「聖人」的禮節都不曉得？一男大須婿，女人須嫁」，你現在也是別家的人了！——又說道「嫁鷄隨鷄，嫁狗隨狗」……」</p>
<p>爸爸的話還沒有說完，姐姐忽然停止哭聲，忿怒的看着他：</p>
<p>「不要說了。你老人家的大道理我聽得很多……」</p>

<h3 id="c234">「自由神」觀後感 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 施雍</p>
<p>讀「歷史」的時候，對法國大革命史蘇俄革命史常致無限的嚮往，常覺那偉大的時代是充滿着偉大的熱力的。</p>
<p>自己是曾親身沐浴於同樣偉大的時代中的，五四，五卅，國民革命，雖未必統統都親自參與過那劃時代的工作，却也曾經眼見到那偉大的巨浪衝激着的雄姿。</p>
<p>可是五四時代靑年思想解放運動的朝氣，五卅時代反帝運動民族解放運動的怒潮，及民國十六年北伐時代舉國革命情緒狂熱的「烟士披里純」，到了今日，那裏去了？現在，舉國向復古的道路上回去了，革命的情緒全部消沈了，舉國在靜默的空氣裏參待着帝國主義者不斷的宰割！</p>
<p>大時代的浪潮已經靜止了，靜止了！過往的一　切只在夢魂中繚繞！</p>
<p>看了電通的自由神的試映，重又引起了我憶舊的情緒了。畫面上是由王瑩扮演着貫串五四至一二八這二十年中四個大時代的時代女性，從娜拉的姿態起，躍入反帝運動民族解放運動的戰爭，將四個時代的特徵，深深的刻劃着。</p>
<p>最使我受刺激的，很奇怪，是聽了那一支「此調久已不彈」的國民革命歌：畫面上許多革命志士在火車蠕蠕前進中車廂裏所放出的「打倒××，除軍閥」的歌聲，恍惚還像昨日，但那一支簡單雄壯的歌聲，卻早已沈寂了！</p>
<p>這些都給我重新溫了一次舊課，而那情緒又恍惚回到了當時！</p>
<p>中國處在今日的情勢下，被危害的程度較之十年前有過之而無不及，危亡的黑影已憧憧的映在眼前，我們當如何實燃起時代的火炬，恢復以往奮鬥的精神，踏着艱難的道路，反抗壓迫，反抗宰割呢！時代的兒女們，我們的肩頭是負着比五四五卅時代更偉大的更艱鉅的工作啊！</p>
<p>然而，舉國只向復古的道路上回去了，革命的情緒全部消沈了，舉國在靜默的空氣裏等待着帝國主義者不斷的宰割！</p>
<p>啊，時代的兒女們呢？</p>

<p>於是一壁挽頭髮，一壁走下樓梯，好像滾下去的，她不要別人攙扶，自己就坐上了轎子，不知那來的勁兒，忽然走得那麽快！</p>
<p>爸爸對着快出院門的轎子，自言自語的：「這孩子，也算「知書識禮啦！」</p>
<p>可是還不到三天，男家送來了兇信，說是姐姐在頭天晚間自縊死了。這消息眞像一聲霹靂，媽媽馬上給震的昏死，爸爸也氣得捶胸口，全家大小哭做一團。經伯母和嬸娘們許久的呼喊，媽媽纔淸醒轉來，可是她一壁哭泣，一壁指着爸爸說：「都是你害了我女兒呵！當年還在肚子裏便拿來配人！」</p>
<p>「指腹爲婚，何止我一個？」爸爸揩着眼淚說，「這也祗怪她的命啦！」</p>
<p>當時我分辯不出究竟是爸爸的過錯，還是姐姐的「命」？祇暗暗的流了許多眼淚，覺得姐姐死得力可憐了！</p>

<p>— 沉軻</p>
<p>要估量這一國家這一時代具體的姿態，與其在許多上層建築的政治學術文化諸相去評斷，毋寗到村野山谷里去搜求一點人民日常活動的眞相，再加以歸納和統計，必可得一較切實較正確的眞價。我頗想爲這一個理由多多地與鄉邨相接近，可是，往往只成了一個懷念而已，因爲生活的鞭驅策我日漸遠離鄉邨，幾年來，至少與鄉村的實際情境已有多少隔膜了。但鄉邨並沒有因此靜止，而正因時代的反動波浪，衝激成許多離奇古怪的事態，這些，我常想那都是易眩生式的話劇材料。</p>
<p>下面我將介紹兩件一角鄉邨集團中的新奇事。</p>
<p>（一）××軒妖氛瀰漫</p>
<p>××軒，是由地方上頗有地位的名流組織的扶乩團體，主持其事的是一位聞名江浙一帶的名書畫家趙××氏。</p>
<p>趙氏早年足跡曾遍歷國內名山大川，且曾任某邑縣令，所作字畫挺拔秀麗，固一不可多得的才子也。自歸鄉墊居而後，習書畫以爲生，一時慕名而來索其墨費者日有數起，踵門而稱弟子者也大有人在。不意這幾年來，不知由什麽靈感的襲來，竟信奉了濟公活佛，築起了××軒，扶乩爲人探問過去未來，並爲人開方治病，一時生涯鼎盛。</p>
<p>經這般名流聞人高登一呼，愚夫愚婦如籌斯應，迷信的氛圍於是瀰漫於城廂內外。</p>
<p>該地執與論之責丄的各家報紙大多暮氣沈沈，不量屬於紳士派的，便是字着做準紳士的，所以對於這種愚妄的舉動大多並不加以評論或斥責。有××報者，竟登其扶乩所得的治疫藥方於報上並加介紹而歌誦焉，閱者莫不爲之嘆息。</p>
<p>孰知事態之出奇尙有不止此者。最近有一鄉人，手臂上患不一個毒瘡，說醫於乩壇，趙氏爲開方紙一張，上面寫的你道是什麼秘方仙丹？原來是赫然「閨女月經煮湯塗擦」數字。見者旣莫不稱奇，而病者欲求所謂「閨女月經」，尤煞費苦心，第不知此鄉人如何覓得閨女之月經水也。</p>
<p>（二）謊稱得獎券首獎</p>
<p>此處隣近滬地，中上人家的子弟在上海習商業的，人數很多‘但沂年來因海上工商業凋敝，無穩固的背景的往往要遭受到失業的威脅。</p>
<p>我這裏所說的一位自殺者，倒並不因失業而自殺。他因姊氏裙帶關係，供職某商號，每月薪水不下五六十金，個人生活，理應綽綽有餘，不料近來忽異想天開，謊稱得航空獎券頭獎。先是得知首獎號碼後，至發售獎券的商店佯問某號（卽首獎）有否獲獎，由是告知彼已獲獎。獎券店卽派人至其供職的商號去道喜，並問是否擬托獎券店代領獎金，彼慨然付賞金數元，謂將由彼自向銀行提領，領得後將另有賞金，卽揮之使去。自是商號中人咸以爲某氏已獲首獎，皆大歡喜，而彼則迷戀於一摩登女，舉動闊綽，一若已成富翁者。後來事聞於其姊丈，勸諭某氏切勿將所得完全浪化，應提出若于儲存於銀行，以備不時之需。奈某氏因並未得獎金也，迫之窮，某氏方謂並未獲得獎金。其姊丈大訝，知有弊，當囑商號經理請查彼所負責的賬目，淸理之下，果然宕空達二千餘元之鉅。一塲喜劇旣經告終，接續的就是自殺的悲劇了。</p>
<p>鄉村中的形形色色，其熱鬧並不下於都會風光，然則鄉村的命運也將回樣墮入崩裂的火山中嗎？思之不禁憮然。</p>
<p>專述</p>

<p>此外，在印度其他各地的華僑之生活狀態，也是與在加爾各答的相同的，無須一一詳述。</p>
<p>（香港）香港原是珠江口岸的一個荒島，沒有居民。及至一八四〇年中英鴉片戰爭發生，中國戰敗，才簽訂條約，將香港割給英人；一八四二年，南京條約又追認之。自是以後，荒凉的香港在英人的經營之下，竟成爲了商業軍事之重鎭，被稱爲來亞鉅埠了。</p>
<p>據一九二〇年調查，全境人數共有五十一萬四千六百，其中有華人五十萬零一千，可說是一個純粹的中國都市。在工商業方面，當然是華人佔絕對優勢，但統治權全操在英人之手，所以在這裏的最大多數華人的行動皆極威不便；而且，英人更以地理上的關係，利用香港以直接對我實行經濟政治的侵略。說來實是可歎！（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Yellow River Upper Reaches Rise; Dike Repair Committee Urges Prompt Closing of the Breach; Dongzhuang Breach Flow Increases Suddenly; Upper Reaches Flood Pours into Weishan Lake; Committee Cables Shandong to Dig Embankments and Release Water <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) A special dispatch received today from Western Shandong reports that the flow from the Dongzhuang breach has suddenly increased, and the main force of the upper reaches flood has arrived. Shao Hanyuan has urgently telegraphed the three counties of Tongshan, Fengxian, and Pei to strictly strengthen defenses, protect the dikes, and investigate that Western Shandong is full of water. The flood from the breach will reach Northern Jiangsu in three days. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dike Repair Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, following the resolution of the meeting to dredge the Yellow River breach waters, will divert the water entering Weishan Lake through the Hukou Dam, Lanjia Dyke, the Middle Canal, the Liutang River, and the Guan River, resulting in an outflow to the sea of 700 cubic meters per second, exceeding the set limit. However, the upper reaches of the Yellow River are increasing continuously and it is vital to find ways to close the breach in the upper reaches. If the water continues to pour downstream, Northern Jiangsu will become a marsh, the Dike Repair project will be affected, and the Jinpu and Longhai railways may be washed out. The Dike Repair Committee has telegraphed the Economic Commission to quickly devise relief measures and rush to close the breach in the upper reaches. Li Yishe, seeing the serious situation of the Yellow River invading southward, has telegraphed Shandong and Henan to strictly order Juancheng to harvest sorghum within five days, and dig open the civilian embankments to release water, returning to the main river at Huanghua Temple. The Economic Commission has also received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that the Middle Canal's flow has increased to 900 cubic meters per second. Furthermore, according to a letter from the Dike Repair Committee, the Yellow River's water level in Shanzhou increased to 1130 cubic meters per second on the afternoon of the 29th, putting the Xuzhou area and the Jinpu and Longhai railways in extreme danger. The Economic Commission believes that Li Yishe's proposed method is truly an emergency measure and has telegraphed the Shandong Provincial Government to dig the embankments as ordered. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River has been rising for days, and the people of Heze and Juancheng are startled multiple times each night. Liu Zhi and Shang Zhen have both telegraphed Han, instructing him to ensure ships are used to transport breach closing materials. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The flow at the Dongzhuang breach suddenly increased on the 31st, and the main force of the upper reaches flood has arrived, rushing towards Weishan Lake. The situation is extremely critical. Special Commissioner Shao has urgently telegraphed the three county heads of Tongshan, Pei, and Fengxian to guard the dikes day and night without negligence, and to pay particular attention to preventing the breaching of dikes west of Weishan. Furthermore, it is reported that the water level at Zhengji west of Weishan will rise one foot tonight. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission previously telegraphed the Shandong Provincial Government to handle the closing of the breach and diversion of the flood, and telegraphed Li Yishe and Kong Xiangrong to be responsible for supervising implementation. As of now, no reply telegram has been received. Shandong and Henan have requested funds for closing the breach, and the Commission is currently investigating the progress of the Shandong breach closing project in order to prepare for remittance of funds for assistance. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dike Repair Committee, concerned about the serious water situation in Northern Jiangsu, which is greatly affecting the Dike Repair project, dispatched Chief Engineer Xu Kai on the morning of the 31st to conduct an on-site inspection of the relevant areas of the Huai River. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Weishan Lake rose six centimeters on the 31st, reaching a true height of 36.697 meters. The Bulao River continued to rise, and the situation is critical. The flood from Ningxia is continuously entering Shandong. The increasing water level at the breach makes the future of Northern Jiangsu bleak. Additionally, in Pi County, the construction of the Shengyang Mountain dike to conserve water and prevent the Yellow River was disrupted on the afternoon of the 30th when Shandong and Henan sent a regiment of soldiers, leading 2,000 civilians, to dig open the dike. The water flowed rapidly, directly into the Middle Canal, causing the Liutang River to surge two feet on the afternoon of the 31st, flowing directly into the Inner Canal. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) On the 30th, the railway tracks on the Tongxi section of the Longhai Railway in Weinan's Xichishui were washed away, derailing a freight car coming from the east, but no one was injured. The Railway Bureau repaired the tracks in the afternoon, delaying passenger trains in both directions by ten hours. The express train has not yet resumed service. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Shen Baixian returned to the provincial capital on the 31st and reported that both sides of the railway from Xubu to Hanzhuang are a vast expanse of water, inundating an area of 500,000 mu. Thanks to the efforts of Tongshan, Fengxian, and Pei counties in building dikes, 2 million mu more farmland has been preserved compared to the floods of 1926. The flow in the Middle Canal has increased to 900 cubic meters per second, exceeding the flow stipulated by the Economic Commission by one time. If the water level in Weishan Lake remains within 37 meters, it may be possible to preserve it, otherwise, both Xuzhou and Huai'an will be unimaginable disasters, beyond human ability to alleviate. The only hope now is for the central government and Shandong Province to close the breach as soon as possible and reduce the disaster. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The dam and bridge on the western section of the Longhai Railway were washed away by the flood, making repairs difficult. Trains on both ends cannot reach the bridge to pick up passengers, so the Railway Bureau has announced that westward passenger tickets can only be sold to Weinan. They are currently rushing to build a temporary bridge to restore traffic. Additionally, on the eastern section, the Taizhao branch line has been dug through in several places by the people between Suyang Mountain and Chefushan to divert the Yellow River's water, thus the traffic on the Taizhao branch line is blocked, and the Zhongxing coal transport has been temporarily suspended. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The old embankment at Dongbatou has collapsed into a small bay, and the water has reached the base of the new dike at Yangzhuang, which is being protected with sandbags. The flood is two inches higher than the previous major flood on the 25th. On the night of the 31st, the main flood from Liuyuan and Heigang is approaching the north side. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Northern Xuzhou Water Situation Gradually Stabilizes; Flood Risk Center Shifts to Pi County; Provincial Government Allocates Funds for Emergency Relief <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water situation in Northern Xuzhou is gradually stabilizing: (1) The western dike of Weishan Lake is temporarily free of danger, but everything inside the ring dike is a marsh. (2) The constriction of the water at the Jingshan Bridge is impeding the flow of the Bulao River, and it is planned to breach the bridge to facilitate drainage. (3) The water level at Maocun on the Jinpu Railway rose one centimeter on the 31st, but the floodwater from the Weiyun River is approaching the side of the railway. The railway authorities are confident that there will be no major problems. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Regarding the Huai-Pi section, the Middle Canal upstream, influenced by the digging of the Wangmu Mountain dam, Yao Bay suddenly rose another nine inches on the 21st, storing water one zhang and nine chi and nine cun deep. Suwater suddenly rose six inches, storing water one zhang and seven chi deep, with the flow increasing to 1,400 cubic meters per second. The water level of the Inner Canal rose more than two cun again today. However, due to the obstruction of the water dams at Gu Yintou Gate and Shuangjin Gate, and the low water level of Honghu Lake, most of the incoming water is backflowing into Honghu Lake, causing the Jiangba gauge at that lake to increase by two centimeters from 10.41 meters, although it is still five meters short of the high water level of 1931. As for the microsurvey, it rose nine centimeters and three points today, storing water 36.71 meters deep. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water situation in Northern Xuzhou, including Pei and Feng counties, has been relatively stable recently, but Pi County has been busy with emergency relief. Because Pi County is where the Yun River and Bulao River converge, there is a north-south flood control dike running through the Taizhao Road, causing the water to overflow. The Bulao River dike has repeatedly collapsed, submerging over a hundred villages. Officials and civilians are rushing to close the breaches day and night. The center of flood risk in Northern Xuzhou has shifted to Pi County. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially dispatched Wei Zhiji, Ning Bojin, Zhang Guoqiong, and four others, arriving in Xuzhou on the 31st to assist in disaster relief and dike protection. They are scheduled to go to Feng and Pei counties on the 1st to survey the dikes. Furthermore, when Director of the Jiangsu Construction Bureau Shen Baixian left Xuzhou, he telegraphed Director of Finance Zhao Dihua, requesting a remittance of 30,000 yuan to Special Commissioner Shao of the Tongshan area for dike construction and emergency relief expenses. Shao immediately raised 10,000 yuan from the banking community and other sources, allocating 4,000 yuan to Tongshan, 4,000 yuan to Pei County, and 2,000 yuan to Feng County on the 31st. Additionally, the Jinpu Railway assisted Xuzhou with 700 English cubic feet of stone and automatically built a water diversion structure at the Daishan Bridge south of Maocun to prevent the main force of the Bulao River from flowing downwards. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After fleeing their flooded villages, farmers in the disaster-stricken areas of Northern Xuzhou are begging for food in various villages. The administrative authorities, fearing that the disaster victims would become displaced, have specially designated Yunlong Mountain as a disaster relief area, allowing them to build makeshift reed shelters to shield themselves from wind and rain.

<p>(Hankou) The Provincial Government announced measures for remitting land taxes in disaster areas, remitting one-tenth of the tax for every tenth of the land damaged, and fully remitting taxes for those who suffered complete destruction, which is slightly more generous than usual. It also subsidizes the administrative expenses of Hanyang and seven other counties, for a limited period of three months. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Seeing the severity of the disaster in Hubei, various sectors have initiated theatrical performances to raise 500 yuan, which has been remitted to Hubei for disaster relief. Zhang Qun specially telegraphed his thanks on the 31st. As soon as the funds arrive, they will be allocated for emergency relief. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">International Clouds of War and the Financial Burdens of Various Countries <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The intensity of the clouds of war in the international arena has recently reached its highest point since the European War. In East Asia, the superficial, localized war has temporarily ceased, but the steady progress of military deployments on both sides of the Pacific seems to be preparing for a final, large-scale showdown. In Western Europe, Germany has unilaterally restored its army and navy, and Britain has announced a seven-year naval shipbuilding plan. At the same time, the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia in East Africa has created a cloud of war over the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. The situation of the entire Europe is precarious. What the politicians of various countries are waiting for today seems to be not news of peace, but the first arrow to pluck the strings of war. However, in international relations, peace is the norm, and war is the exception. War is an ominous thing. It contains all kinds of dangerous factors. Today, as the clouds of war pervade the world, we sincerely hope that the ruling authorities and peoples of various countries can pay attention to the development of these dangerous factors. At the moment, we believe that the most dangerous factor that deserves our attention is the increasing financial burden on various countries, which is reaching an unsustainable limit.</p>
<p>Since 1931, Japan's government budgets have consistently had expenditures exceeding revenues, by approximately 900 million yuan per year. Military spending often accounts for half of the total budget. In this year's budget, army and navy spending accounts for 46% of total expenditures. If we remove the portion of the income obtained from borrowing, the military spending can reach 70% of revenue. Expenditures do not correspond to income. The method of compensating for this shortfall is to issue public bonds. The amount of public bonds held by the Japanese government has now reached 8,500,000,000 yuan. By the end of this year, the amount of national debt may reach 10,000,000,000 yuan. This is what the Japanese financial authorities consider to be the saturation point. In fact, it is already difficult to digest the 150,000,000 yuan in public bonds that are planned to be issued this year. Earlier this year, Germany was preparing to restore its military. In January, it forcibly issued 500 million marks in public bonds. The source of these bonds was the reserve funds of various savings banks. In mid-March, it issued the same amount of public bonds using the insurance companies' reserve funds. Germany's military buildup has forced France to similarly increase its national defense budget. Since 1930, France's financial deficit has accumulated to 27,617,000,000 francs. The budget deficit for this year is 6,000,000,000 francs, and there are 5,000,000,000 francs in special expenditures. Put together, the financial losses are considerable. The recent disputes caused by the French government's reduction in staff and salaries are sufficient to show the difficult financial situation. Italy's foreign trade has declined steadily in recent years. Although tariffs, exchange rate management, and restrictions on intangible exports, etc. have been used, they have been ineffective. As a result, the financial situation has been greatly affected. From December of last year to February of this year, Italy had to withdraw 2,000,000,000 lire from the national bank to pay for imported goods. This year, due to the active preparation for the East African war, the need for imports has greatly increased. By mid-July, Italy had to suspend the 42% gold reserve system and exhaust all its wealth to prepare for war. The fiscal deficit in Italy this year is 1,702,000,000 lire. The special expenditure for the East African war is not included. Now that the war has not started, the daily military expenditure in Africa is about 5 to 10 million lire. Therefore, when the war breaks out or spreads widely in the future, the financial burden will indeed be a major problem.</p>
<p>Observers of international politics believe that the great powers' military build-up has two causes. One is financial difficulty, requiring them to seize markets abroad. The other is economic panic, with people living in instability, requiring a foreign war to stimulate their patriotism, so that they do not turn to revolution due to the insecurity of their lives. It seems that financial difficulty is the cause, and launching a war is the result. However, military build-up first increases the financial burden even more, and makes people's lives feel more insecure. The dangerous factors contained in war mainly lie in this. Today, as the clouds of war pervade the world, this point should be the most difficult question for the ruling authorities and peoples of various countries, and also the most important lesson to be learned.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Chinese Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin arrived in Yokohama at 5:00 a.m. on the 31st aboard the Empress of Russia, and immediately entered the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo. Jiang made a statement to Japanese reporters, saying that after returning to China, he had repeatedly met with Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to discuss Sino-Japanese goodwill policies. He has returned to his post this time with determination and sincerity towards Sino-Japanese goodwill. Anything that is beneficial to both countries can be discussed. He will visit Foreign Minister Hirota on the 2nd to deliver his credentials and discuss this issue. The anti-Japanese policy announced by Chiang Kai-shek in February of this year has not changed so far, and its methods, timing, and stages are progressing smoothly.

<h3 id="e9">Roosevelt Approves Three Congressional Bills; Current Status of Silver Imports and Exports in the United States <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt approved three bills passed by Congress today: one is the Coal Act, which establishes a small-scale revitalization law for the coal industry. President Roosevelt strongly urged Congress to pass it, regardless of doubts about its legality and opposition from his own party. Therefore, the passage of this bill is a victory for President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt had asked the leaders of the coal miners' union to find a way to pass this bill, and the union leaders then called off a large-scale strike based on President Roosevelt's promise. The second is the Liquor Control Act, which stipulates the establishment of a new liquor commission, subject to the control of the Ministry of Finance, to replace the Federal Alcohol Administration, which was abolished when the Supreme Court ruled that the revitalization law was unconstitutional. The third is the Wealth Donation Act, which stipulates increased taxes on industrial capital stock and personal surtaxes, as well as taxes on gift interests, corporate income taxes, and excessive profits. This bill has undergone slight changes from its original form when it was proposed on June 9th. The new inheritance tax advocated by President Roosevelt has been removed by the joint conference of the Senate and the House of Representatives. However, both capital and gift taxes have been increased. This bill increases taxes for those with incomes above 50,000 yuan, and it is estimated that national income can increase by 250 million to 270 million yuan as a result. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) In the week ending August 23, silver imports into the United States totaled $6,493,000, an increase of $1,759,000 from the previous week. Of this amount, $3,943,000 came from the United States, an increase of $2,051,000 from the previous week, $1,779,000 from Mexico, $4,000 from the Philippines, $144,000 from Peru, $8,000 from Chile, $3,000 from France, $7,000 from Russia, $6,000 from Bolivia, $21,000 from Venezuela, and $2,000 from Egypt.

<p>(Geneva) The Permanent Advisory Committee on Illicit Drugs of the League of Nations recently sent a report to the League of Nations, stating that the global production of narcotics in 1934 was lower than in any previous year. Currently, the production amounts of various countries are roughly commensurate with legitimate consumption quantities. However, although the production amounts of cocaine decreased in most countries last year, they increased in some countries, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, and the Soviet Union.

<p>(Beiping) After the Political Readjustment Committee was ordered to be abolished, Wang Kemin sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan yesterday, requesting the dispatch of a commissioner to Beiping to take over all matters after the closure. As of this afternoon, the Executive Yuan has not yet replied. The internal work of the committee will be completely stopped by this evening, and most of the staff will be dismissed starting tomorrow. Only a very small number of people will be left in the committee to handle unfinished matters. Sections 1 and 2 are currently rushing to complete the closure. Section 1 is in charge of documents and files, and Section 2 is in charge of general affairs and accounting matters. The closure procedures are more complicated and will take another week to complete. The salaries of the staff for August have been paid yesterday, and an additional month's interest will be paid for September. Wang Kemin will remain in the committee to supervise everything until all the closure matters are completed. After handing over to the Executive Yuan commissioner, he will move out of the committee and go to Nanjing to report to the central government at a later date. After completing the matters in Nanjing, he will reportedly go to Shanghai before heading south. The planned departure date is January. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng arrived in Beiping this morning from Tianjin after being summoned by Wang Kemin's telegram. According to Yin, he came to meet Wang and discuss important matters. It is undecided when he will return to Tangshan. Li Zhenhua, the main suspect in the Liu case, is currently being interrogated in Tangshan. It is still uncertain whether the Zhang and Li who were indicated as accomplices are real or not, and will only be confirmed after the trial is completed. As of now, the Japanese side has not expressed any opinion on the Liu case. As for the Shigejie car hijacking case, he only saw the protests raised by the Japanese side in the newspapers, and does not know the details. The banditry atmosphere in the Luan, Yu, Ji, and Mi districts is particularly rampant near Malanyu and Ji County. The security forces are dividing up to intercept them. Reports say that some of the remaining security forces in Cang County will be transferred to the war zone for rotation. The matter is being negotiated, and implementation is pending. After the closure of the Political Readjustment Committee, the commissioner's offices in the two districts will, in accordance with the organizational regulations, be directed by the Hebei Provincial Government.

<p>(Tianjin) Qin Dechun is still staying in Tianjin for a day and will go to Beiping tomorrow. According to Qin, Song's assumption of the post of Commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison is still undecided. No orders from the central government have been received for either Song or himself. Song does not think there is an urgent need, but Commander Wang is eager to unload his duty. Qin has to wait for Song to take over and make proper arrangements before returning to Chahar. It is expected that he will take over before the Mid-Autumn Festival. The members of the Chahar Provincial Government have not been vacated, and Song is still serving as a member, so there is no need for reorganization. Chahar Province has been quite peaceful recently. Some of the Chahar security forces have been deployed to designated defense areas. The original plan was to recruit 4,000, but the number is still insufficient and is being intensified. This security force is reorganized from the original security office team. A gang of bandits was discovered in the Changping area more than ten days ago, and Commander Zhang Yunrong sent a team to suppress them, and they have been wiped out. Bandits have also recently appeared in Yanqing, Yong'anpu, and Sihaikou. Because the boundaries of the area are unclear, the security forces will be formed and searched. Whether some of the Chahar troops will be sent to protect Beiping and Tianjin will be decided after Song takes office. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Abyssinia: Urgently Increasing Defenses in the Northern Mountains, Numbering 300,000 to 400,000, Digging Trenches Everywhere, Morale Extremely High, Ammunition Only Sufficient for Three Days <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>A Jing: Political circles here are increasingly pessimistic about the peaceful resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Abyssinia's order to defend against aerial attacks has caused widespread anxiety. Several days ago, the King of Abyssinia instructed the people that when enemy planes attack, they should fire cannons and ring bells to warn the public, who should quickly seek refuge in open spaces. The most vulnerable targets now are the palace, armory, radio station, and airfield. Efforts to protect the palace are currently underway. The ground forces in the northern mountains have been greatly reinforced, estimated to total between 300,000 and 400,000 men. Trenches have been dug everywhere, with the intention of resisting enemy tanks. Defenses in the south are being built at a slower pace, but small artillery positions numbering 18 have been constructed in Wogadeng and Jerogubi to prevent the enemy from concentrating their forces. The garrisons in Jijiga, Jerogubi, and Dagoba have all been reinforced. The morale of the Abyssinian army is excellent, but the total ammunition is only sufficient for three days of large-scale modern warfare. The authorities are quite confident about guerrilla warfare in the highlands. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Jing: Abyssinia's only government weekly newspaper, called "Light and Freedom," published an edict from the Abyssinian Emperor to the people, urging them to remain calm. It stated that planes cannot bomb the earth, tanks cannot climb mountains, and poison gas is forbidden by international law. At the same time, banks, post offices, and all public services will operate as usual, so do not disturb yourselves. Finally, it declared that as long as Abyssinia has a breath left, it must fight for freedom, and that it is better to die as a glorious spirit than to live as a slave. To this end, the Abyssinian Emperor cited patriotic heroes from ancient times who sacrificed their lives for their country to encourage the people. (31st National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The famous reporter Poli Coc of the Morning Post has just returned from the capital of Abyssinia. He believes that it will be difficult for Italian troops to occupy Abyssinia without many years of bitter fighting, unless the chiefs of Abyssinia betray the Abyssinian Emperor, in which case the situation would be different. According to his conversation with an Associated Press reporter, Abyssinia has a million soldiers, 350,000 of whom are equipped with modern rifles, 350,000 are equipped with breech-loading rifles, and 350,000 have only swords and spears. In addition, they can gather 3,000 machine guns and 200 old cannons. They have neither gas nor tanks, and only 13 old-fashioned commercial airplanes. Only 8,000 men are well-trained, and 350,000 are untrained. The rest are private troops of the chiefs, but they are all brave, good at fighting, and able to endure hardship. They are quite confident that the Italians will not be able to endure this hardship. It is now heard that Italy may suggest to the Abyssinian Crown Prince to place Abyssinia under Italian protection. The Crown Prince is tall and stout, 20 years old, and does not approve of his father's anti-Italian policies. (31st National Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e17">Abyssinian Mining Rights Granted to British and American Companies for a Term of 75 Years <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>A Jing City: The government has just issued an official announcement stating that it signed a contract with an American company this morning, agreeing to grant the company the rights to exploit coal and oil in a large area. This oil mine is located in the area bordering Abyssinia with Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, and its scope accounts for more than half of the mineral deposits in the area. (31st Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources in A Jing today confirmed that the contract has been signed. The Abyssinian government has granted the African Development Company, organized by an American, the concession to mine and extract oil in a large area of land in Abyssinia. The company is registered in Delaware in the United States. The negotiator was Mr. Rickert, who is known to many in London, Iraq, Egypt, and Abyssinia, but it is not known which oil company he is associated with. Although dispatches from A Jing state that the concession was obtained by an American company, people here expect that the British will participate in it. It is said that the African Development Company will invite other major oil companies to co-operate. Sources in official circles say that the British government has not received any reports about this concession. The government has not provided any formal or informal assistance to this British and American company. The government has repeatedly stated that, apart from Lake Chana, Britain has no land or economic interests in Abyssinia. It is heard that the government has instructed its ambassador to Abyssinia to investigate the matter in detail. Mr. Rickert previously found oil rights in Iraq for a British oil company. A close friend of his today used enthusiastic language to tell a Reuters reporter that this is one of the largest transactions in history, but the friend declined to reveal who is behind it. It is heard that the funds needed for this concession in the future will reach several trillion pounds in British currency. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Jing: The 75-year concession for coal and oil mining granted by the Abyssinian government to the African Development Company includes half of eastern Abyssinia. The concession price is not yet known. All coal and gas in the Aucaheli area are within its scope of exploitation. The company was represented by Mr. Rickert in the negotiations, and the Abyssinian government was represented by Colson, who currently serves as the Abyssinian government's economic advisor. The negotiations took place in the Abyssinian Imperial Palace for eight days and nights before the Abyssinian Emperor signed it on Friday morning. According to observations from Jijiga, Jeluge, and Ogaden, the oil reserves in the Hawash River basin are extremely rich. According to the contract, the company must start surveying within one year and start mining within five years. In addition to exporting 2,500,000 tons duty-free each year, it must also find ways to supply Abyssinia's needs. At the same time, the company has priority in obtaining concessions for the discovery of asphalt, iodine, and other valuable minerals. (31st National Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Jing: Regarding the claim that the Abyssinian government has granted coal and oil mining rights to the African Development Company, jointly funded by British and American capital, there has been no official announcement here, but the facts are all there and cannot be denied. The initiator of this matter was the international financier Rickert, and the negotiator was the African Development Company. This company is controlled by Mobil Oil behind the scenes. The contract was signed on August 29, with a concession period of 75 years, and the right to exploit coal and other natural products in eastern Abyssinia. The area is vast, starting from the Eritrean border, along the 40th latitude to the Hawash River basin, then from here to the Ji-A Railway, and then extending to southwestern Abyssinia to Lake Rudolph on the border of British Kenya. The company's total capital is 50 million US dollars. Once all the equipment is complete, the Abyssinian government will receive a rent of 5 million US dollars per year. The company is now preparing to lay an oil pipeline from the Jilu Oil District through Harar to the coast. This section is 300 miles long and will cost 15 million US dollars. Geological survey work will begin in a few weeks. The partitioning of the Iraqi oil fields among various countries was also Rickert's plan. Now that Mr. Rickert's work has come to an end, he has taken a plane to London via Cairo. (31st National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources say that the British government has expressed that it has not heard anything about Abyssinia granting oil rights to British and American companies. Unless there are concrete facts, it does not pay attention to this news.

(31st National Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The Foreign Office today issued a notice to Britons who intend to serve in the Italian or Abyssinian armies, saying that this act violates the 1870 Foreign Enlistment Act. This law prohibits British nationals from serving in the armed forces of a foreign country that is at war with a friendly nation of Britain without the permission of the British Emperor. Furthermore, the 1934 Cabinet order on Abyssinia stipulated that if any Briton participates in any war in Abyssinia, whether supporting or opposing the country, it will be considered a serious crime and will be punished with two years in prison or a fine of 500 pounds. So far, a total of 2,500 Britons have written to the Abyssinian Embassy in London to request enlistment. The Abyssinian Embassy has issued a statement, saying that the Abyssinian government is deeply grateful for everyone's chivalry, but because they are not familiar with the Abyssinian language, they fear that there will be many obstacles in commanding soldiers and other matters, so they cannot accept everyone's request and are deeply sorry.

<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas, leader of the silver faction, declared today that if the government does not urgently implement a silver purchase plan, which he intends to amend, he will lean towards advocating controlled currency. He hopes this matter can be resolved before the next Congress convenes in January and believes that the Ministry of Finance's implementation of the silver purchase law will become a major issue for discussion in the next Congress. This opinion has been confirmed by the active efforts of the following silver faction members in Congress: (1) The Pittman Committee plans a friendly investigation into the Ministry of Finance's implementation of the silver purchase law. (2) The Thomas Committee will seek opinions from bankers and currency experts on the gold standard, bimetallism, and controlled currency. (3) The House Rules Committee defends the Ministry of Finance's silver policy. After studying McAdoo's amendment to abolish the 50% tax on silver profits, the committee issued a report today stating that this abolition only benefits speculators in the banking industry who have made no contribution to silver and only want to reap the benefits of the government's plan without labor. The Ministry of Finance's policy cannot be dictated by speculators. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya of This Newspaper: The Situation in Henan Province and the Disaster Conditions in Various Counties</p>
<p>Kaifeng, the ancient Dàliáng and Bianzhou, served as the capital for the Five Dynasties and the Northern Song Dynasty. It is one of China's five ancient capitals and is now the capital of Henan Province. The city has a circumference of thirty-five li and a population of 320,000. The roads, from the station in the south, passing through the Great South Gate to Sun Yat-sen Road in Zhongshan Park, or from the Small South Gate to the North Gate via Gonghe Road, as well as Shengfu Road, Ziyou Road, and Bo'ai Road (some unfinished), are either asphalt or gravel-paved, mostly straight, wide, and well-maintained, meeting the needs of a modern city. The willows and elms planted along the roads are lush and form rows. Shengfu Road East, the area behind Xiangguo Temple Street, and Gulou Street are the most prosperous areas of the city. Citizens on the sidewalks come and go in an endless stream, and their clothing is mostly domestically produced, their demeanor simple, leaving a good impression. On the roads, there are very few cars, more rickshaws, and human-powered vehicles are the most numerous. Empty rickshaws stay on one side of the road, neatly lined up, resembling the Wei army attacking Wu, with ships lined up for miles. The large number of vehicles and the sluggish business indicate the difficulty for ordinary people to make a living. The Drum Tower is a majestic structure, towering into the clouds. Climbing it not only provides a view of the entire city, but also fulfills its inscription, "Reaching All Distant Places." The second floor houses a popular library, and the third floor is the location of the Journalists' Association and the fire brigade. The appropriateness of the institutions' locations can be described as "well-placed." Places of interest include: (1) Yuwangtai (Terrace of King Yu), located three li southeast of the city, was originally Chuitai, the site of the Jin musician Shi Kuang. It has a variety of flowers and trees, and the scenery is pleasant. Later, Xia Yu was worshiped here, and the name was changed to its current name. (2) Jiangyi Tai (Terrace for Discussing the Yijing), south of Yuwangtai, is where Cheng Mingdao and his brothers discussed the Yijing with Zhang Hengqu. (3) Fan Ta (Fan Pagoda), about one li southeast of the station, initially had a platform built by Cangjie and Shiziye. Later, the Fan family lived next to it, hence the name Fan Tai. A pagoda was built on the platform, hence the name Fan Ta. There are many inscriptions inside the pagoda, and the outside is covered with glazed yellow bricks, with Buddhist images molded on the brick surfaces, the style of which has artistic value. Around the pagoda is the Agricultural College of Henan University, with buildings arranged like chess pieces and flowers and trees beautifully flourishing. (4) Xinlingjun Ci (Temple of Lord Xinling), the scenery is quiet, and now it is the location of the Girls' Normal School. (5) Huilong Miao (Returning Dragon Temple), located five li northeast of the city, was built by Yu Zhongsu during the Ming Dynasty to appease the Bian River. It has a cast iron rhinoceros to suppress the water, with the inscription: "Water monsters hide, Feng Yi withdraws, the city is safe, this has been the case for a long time." (6) Tie Ta (Iron Pagoda), located next to Twenty-Odd-Trees Temple inside the North Gate, was built during the Qingli period of the Song Dynasty. It is thirteen stories high, with yellow-red bricks forming doors and windows without using any wood. It is entirely inlaid with small Buddhist images. In the past, stone steps could be used to ascend to the highest point, where there was an iron statue at the door. The entire pagoda stands tall, resembling a very powerful steel whip. (7) Zhongshan Gongyuan (Zhongshan Park), located in the northeast corner of the city, was the former palace of the Song Dynasty, with magnificent palaces and clear lakes. A statue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen is built at the entrance, but it lacks the scenery of trees, forests, mountains, and rocks. Kang Youwei visited and wrote a poem: "Looking from afar, the cold overlooks Bianzhou, the Fan Pagoda and Iron Pagoda float with the clouds. Ten thousand families have no trees and no palaces, only the Yellow River flows turbulently." (8) Henan Bowuguan (Henan Museum), has many exhibits, including bronzes unearthed in Xinzheng in 1920 and oracle bones and stone carvings excavated in Luoyang Zhangde, which are especially valuable. Overall, the city appearance, scenic spots, and customs of Kaifeng are similar to those of Beiping. The city is not only the political and cultural center of Henan Province, but also an important city in Central China. It is a pity that the city walls are lower than the Yellow River water level, and there is always the danger of the dikes collapsing and the city being submerged, which has led to a decline in land prices and economic stagnation. Whenever the Yellow River water level rises, wealthy households often move to Zhengzhou to avoid danger. It is said that this autumn's water is fierce, and if the breach at Dongzhuang in western Shandong had not occurred, either Kaifeng or Lanfeng would have suffered a major disaster. These words are based on facts and are extremely alarming. Preventing disasters before they happen is a difficult project, and the responsible personnel should make extra efforts together. Cultivating a large city is not easy in terms of history, geography, and human affairs. If something unexpected happens, the responsibility cannot be shirked.</p>
<p>Henan Province suffered a severe drought in the spring and a major flood in the autumn. The disaster in various counties is serious and widespread. According to a survey by the Provincial Relief Association, the disaster area includes Yanshi, Gongxian, Zhechuan, Yancheng, Fengqiu, Xihua, Shangshui, Xinye, Xiangcheng, Nanyang, Lanfeng, Chenliu, Suiping, Dengxian, Tanghe, Neixiang, Zhenping, Huaxian, Xiping, Qinyang, Xiangcheng, Linzhang, Yiyang, Luoyang, Fanshui, Shangcai, Chongxian, Jiyuan Tangyin, Yanling, Binfeng, Nanzhao, Weishi, Wuyang, Huaiyang, Zhengxian, Yiyang, Runan, Yexian, Zhengyang, Bo'ai, Yanjin, Linru, Hongxian, Yuanwu, Lin'ying, Tongxu, Kaifeng, Guangwu, Wuzhi, and Shanxian, totaling 51 counties. The affected area is 620,462 square li, with 4,279 deaths, 24,905,944 mu of flooded farmland, losses amounting to 4,734,496 yuan, and 427,374 houses collapsed (including 482 earth kilns). The number of affected households is 515,483, with 2,668,029 people in need of relief. (The above figures do not include the reports from more than 20 counties, so the actual figures should be higher.) Only the most severely affected areas, namely Yanshi, Gongxian, Zhechuan, Yancheng, and Fengqiu, received emergency relief funds from the Relief Committee and the Flood Relief Association, totaling 13,000 yuan. In addition, Xin'an and Wenxiang suffered severe hail damage, with hailstones as large as chicken eggs, resulting in considerable losses. The rain and the Zhang River in Anyang also caused significant problems. As for other affected counties, the unreported statistics are said to be numerous. The breach of the Yellow River at Dongzhuang in Zhencheng, western Shandong, only diverted two or three tenths of the flow, and the riverbed is gradually silting up, making navigation inconvenient. The other seven or eight tenths rushed out of the breach, first causing disaster to more than ten counties in western Shandong, filling Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes, and then flowing south and overflowing into northern Jiangsu, seizing the Yun River and entering the Huai River, creating dangerous situations. The counties of Feng, Pi, and Tongshan in northern Jiangsu hastily built two or three lines of dikes, but the water washed them away as easily as crushing dry weeds, and the disaster area is expanding daily. However, this is only the preliminary flow of the Yellow River. Once the main flow arrives, not only will traffic on the Longhai and Jinpu Railways inevitably be disrupted, but the area between Xuzhou, Huai'an, and the Yellow River is likely to turn into a vast swamp, following western Shandong. The Dongzhuang breach has not yet been blocked. If autumn rains occur or the upstream water rises, the increase in the disaster area will be even faster. After autumn, the weather gradually cools, and moisture evaporation decreases, which is also a reason why the Yellow River water will only increase. The Yellow River disaster is just beginning, and thinking about it sends chills down the spine. The Dongzhuang breach is about 400 li from Kaifeng. With the convenience of a car provided by Secretary Wang of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, I went to investigate, and the details will be described separately.</p>
<p>The General Headquarters Issues Measures for Dealing with Bandits to be Implemented in Bandit Suppression Provinces and Designated Areas to Promote Military Eradication and Remove Obstacles in the Rear</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that since the implementation of the new criminal law, the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits have been abolished at the same time. However, banditry has been rampant in various provinces in recent years. Although the National Army has carried out vigorous suppression and achieved some pacification, the remaining bandits, some in groups of tens of thousands, occupy cities, while others, in disorganized groups of hundreds or thousands, appear and disappear unpredictably. According to the principle of using severe measures to govern disorder, a special public order that is relatively strict and allows for swift handling is needed to punish and suppress them. The General Headquarters of the Military Commission Chairman has repeatedly received requests for assistance from military and political leaders of various provinces to curb the emerging chaos. In order to promote the military suppression of bandits and remove obstacles in the rear, ten articles of the "Provisional Measures for Handling Bandit Cases During the Bandit Suppression Period" have been specially formulated, to be implemented in bandit suppression provinces and other designated areas. The order was issued yesterday for compliance. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The General Headquarters of the Military Commission Chairman of the National Government, for the purpose of eliminating banditry and ensuring public security, shall handle bandits during the bandit suppression period in accordance with these measures. Article 2: Anyone who commits one of the following acts shall be considered a bandit and shall be sentenced to death: (1) Forming large gangs and engaging in robbery; (2) Gathering crowds to rob while carrying firearms or explosives; (3) Robbing and intentionally killing or injuring someone, causing death or severe illness, or injuring two or more people; (4) Raping women in a bandit camp; (5) Intending to rob and overturning or destroying ships, trains, trams, automobiles, airplanes, or other vehicles used for land and water transportation, or railway lighthouses and signs, thereby endangering travel; (6) Intending to rob and destroying blockhouses and other defensive works in bandit suppression areas, rendering them unusable; (7) Killing or injuring someone, causing death or severe illness, or injuring two or more people, in order to protect stolen goods from robbery, escape arrest, or destroy evidence; (8) Robbing at sea; (9) Kidnapping for ransom; (10) Harboring or hiding previous bandits or helping to send threatening letters, setting up traps, or communicating on behalf of kidnapped individuals, or paying money for ransom; (11) Intending to defraud and leaving explosives or threatening letters, causing damage to others; (12) Gathering crowds to loot public food and salaries, weapons, ammunition, ships, trains, trams, automobiles, airplanes, and other vehicles used for land and water transportation, or openly occupying railways, electric wires, motors, or destroying them, rendering them unusable; (13) Gathering crowds to occupy cities or other military lands; (14) Gathering in mountains and lakes and resisting government troops; (15) Gathering crowds to seize weapons from garrison troops or security teams and disrupting public security; (16) Gang robbery or disrupting public security; (17) Private smugglers gathering crowds and resisting arrest with weapons; (18) Gathering crowds and seizing prisoners with weapons; (19) The ringleaders and instigators of prisoners gathering crowds to escape by force or coercion; (20) Inciting people, disrupting public security, and causing riots; (21) Intending to disrupt public security and manufacturing, possessing, or carrying explosives; (22) Intending to rob and riot and setting fire to one of the following: 1. Buildings in cities and other densely populated areas; 2. Warehouses and other buildings storing saltpeter, sulfur, ammunition, or military supplies; 3. Mines, barracks, schools, hospitals, relief centers, factories, dormitories, prisons, and other buildings where many people work or reside; 4. Temples, theaters, hotels, and other buildings where many people gather; 5. Ships, trains, trams, automobiles, airplanes, and other vehicles used for land and water transportation in which many people are riding. Article 3:团防Officials and soldiers who themselves become bandits or assist bandits by other means shall be subject to the penalties of the preceding article. Article 4: In any of the following circumstances, the penalty may be reduced by one-half or one-third: (1) The circumstances of the crime are excusable; (2) The offender has begun to commit the crime but has not succeeded, or the act cannot produce the result of the crime and there is no danger, or the offender voluntarily ceases the act or prevents the result from occurring; (3) The offender surrenders to justice for an undiscovered crime. Article 5: Those who commit crimes under these measures shall be tried by military organs with judicial authority in the locality, or by administrative inspectors and county magistrates who also serve as military judges of this General Headquarters. After the judgment, the entire case file shall be submitted, or forwarded through the security command of each province, or the pacification commissioner's office stationed in each province, to this General Headquarters for approval before execution. Article 6: Other laws and regulations that do not conflict with these measures shall still be applicable. Article 7: The death penalty shall be carried out by shooting. Article 8: In addition to the designated bandit suppression provinces, if banditry is still rampant in other provinces and cities, or the remaining bandits have not been cleared, or there is a danger of large gangs spreading, these measures may also be applied after reporting to the General Headquarters and verifying the facts. Article 9: The period of implementation of these measures is provisionally set at one year. Article 10: These measures shall take effect from the date of promulgation. Crimes committed after July 1 of this year that have not been definitively tried shall be dealt with in accordance with these measures. (30th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Hankou Groups Telegraph Request to Establish a Bureau for Dredging the Yangtze River <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Led by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, a Request is Made to the Central Government, Recommending the Collection of Customs Dyke Construction Donations for Funding</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch reports that the Hankou Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various groups believe that the Yangtze River basin has been repeatedly hit by floods, and the crux of the problem is that the riverbed is getting higher and the river channel is becoming narrower. The only good way to fundamentally solve the problem is dredging. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce led the way in jointly telegraphing the Central Government, requesting the establishment of a general bureau to manage the matter in a unified manner, and recommending methods for raising funds. The original telegram reads in brief:</p>
<p>The Iron Pagoda inside the City of Kaifeng</p>
<p>The Street Scene of Kaifeng</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It states, "The provinces in the Yangtze River basin are a mix of Chinese and foreigners, with transportation hubs converging, and commerce has always been prosperous, which has a great relationship with the national economy. However, every spring and summer, when continuous rain falls and mountain floods erupt, the Yangtze River swells and flows downstream with unstoppable force. Since Yu dredged the nine rivers, there has been a lack of research on dredging methods, and only dike construction has been considered. It is not known that the waterbed is increasing day by day, and the river flow is becoming narrower. People compete with water for land, and the water cannot flow in its course, so the rushing torrents breach and overflow, and the dikes collapse in eight or nine out of ten cases. Countless amounts of money are sacrificed, and full protection is not obtained. Countless lives and properties are lost, wails of distress are heard everywhere, and relief is difficult. Chinese and foreign commerce are also greatly affected. Only four years have passed since the great flood of 1931, and now we hear of another flood, the severity of which exceeds even that of 1931. Reflecting on the past and thinking of the present, we fear that there will be floods every year, and everyone will live in fear. If we do not urgently seek a fundamental water control method, it will become another Yellow River, and not only will the provinces in the Yangtze River basin suffer, but the national economy will also inevitably be greatly affected. Currently, each province in the Yangtze River region manages its own water conservancy, lacking an overall plan and adequate coordination. The dikes that have been built may have the drawbacks of benefiting one at the expense of another, benefiting oneself at the expense of others. A general bureau should be established by the central government to manage the matter in a unified manner, employing more specialized personnel, assessing the terrain and water conditions of the upper and lower reaches, dredging where necessary, or building reservoirs, or repairing and strengthening dikes, so that each is appropriate, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Although the cost of dredging is said to be large, it concerns the public interest and shared benefits. As long as the funds are not wasted and the work is practical, raising funds locally should not be difficult. Moreover, it is more beneficial than rushing to rescue and relieve disasters, which wastes huge sums of money every year. The method of raising funds should be that customs offices along the Yangtze River from Chongqing to Shanghai uniformly collect a dyke construction donation, which will be stored in a special account and used forever for water management purposes. No matter what the need, it must not be diverted. In addition, the estimated income from this donation can be used as collateral to borrow large sums of money elsewhere in advance to meet urgent needs. A water conservancy committee should be established to take charge of planning and directing, with clear responsibilities. A donation management committee should also be organized, with representatives from Chinese and foreign chambers of commerce participating in each region to demonstrate credibility. With such comprehensive planning and unified management, it is hoped that there will be a day when the work is completed, and the endless floods in the Yangtze River basin can be permanently avoided."

<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>(27) Remembering the Past, Understanding Lang Son Today</p>
<p>After leaving the chief of the Wen Yuan Zhou, we continued our journey by car. The asphalt road was smooth and clean. European-style buildings were faintly visible among the mountains. The French were clearly determined in their management, unlike the barren and impoverished villages in our country. There is a railway in Dong Dang, with a station. It takes about seven hours to reach Hanoi and Haiphong. By changing to a car, it takes three hours along the highway. The transportation is indeed very convenient. Lang Son is eighteen kilometers away from Zhennan Pass, and it takes about an hour by car. Near Lang Son, there is another railway bridge. Crossing the bridge is Lang Son. Across from it is Qu Luo. Lang Son is where our national heroes made their contributions. Today, the mountains and rivers remain, but the scene is completely different. Merchants gather, European-style buildings stand side by side. Annamese police direct traffic. There are cars, carriages, and rickshaws, much like the scene on Avenue Joffre and Xujiahui in Shanghai. Upon entering, Commissioner Huang first reported to the Lang Son Public Security Bureau to request their protection, and then took a car to tour the city. The area is not large. There are parks and markets. In the market, hundreds of stalls are arranged with all kinds of goods, all run by Annamese women wearing wide-brimmed hats. They carry items on their heads, are barefoot, and wear short shirts. Wealthy women wear blue silk shirts with wide black satin edging. Upper-class men wear black silk or gauze shirts. It is truly a tropical, exotic scene. The currency used is the Vietnamese piastre, which is about one and a bit times the value of the Guangxi currency. The women sit on the ground inside their stalls, or place a large bamboo pipe and a smoking lamp for smoking water pipes at any time. However, most of them look haggard and pale, their poverty and suffering revealed in their faces. Some force a smile, but in an instant, the smile disappears, and the sad expression returns. What the heart shows cannot be concealed. There are many overseas Chinese who run grocery stores. A Cantonese named Hong Dongqing has been running the Xin Chenglong Grocery Store for many years. He says that there were profits to be made in the past few years, but now it is just maintaining the business. There are more than 300 overseas Chinese in the city, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. There is a Chinese Association and a small school. Overseas Chinese have to pay heavy taxes, which is a burden they cannot bear. Overseas Chinese who do not live in a fixed place have to pay a transit tax of one piastre and twenty cents for every ten kilometers. Those who live in a fixed place have to pay a head tax and a business license tax. The head tax is usually twelve yuan per year, and six yuan for laborers. Large businesses even pay hundreds of yuan. After the signing of the Sino-French-Vietnamese treaty, it was stipulated that the head tax paid by overseas Chinese should be reduced by half, but the French side simply shifted the losses from the reduction to the business tax, that is, increasing the business license tax by 60%. The head tax stipulated in the new treaty has not yet been implemented, but the business tax has already been increased by 60%, which can be described as extremely unjust. For example, if the business tax is 300 yuan per year, adding 60% would be 480 yuan. Adding the head tax of 12 yuan would mean that the tax to be paid each year would be 492 yuan. If someone has money but does not do business, they have to pay property tax, the amount of which is determined by the amount of property. If someone paid 900 yuan last year, adding 60% this year would be 800 yuan, plus the head tax. How can they maintain their livelihood? Overseas Chinese are in such a situation. Even if they are good at maneuvering, they will eventually find it difficult to resist long-term exploitation. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to protect them.</p>
<p>(28) Visiting a National Hero</p>
<p>I stayed in Lang Son for about three hours, made some purchases, and then quickly returned to Zhennan Pass. I had lunch at the Fan-division office. At about two o'clock, I went to Aikou Township nearby to visit Han Liushu, an elderly national hero who participated in the Sino-French War. Han is 77 years old this year, originally from Guiping. He served as a foot soldier under Feng Zicai and fought against the enemy at Nanguan. He then settled here, farming for a living. He has three wives. His first wife died of illness last year at the age of 84. He still has two wives and two sons. The two sons, Shaowen and Shaowu, both graduated from Longzhou Middle School and serve in the militia. Han lives in three small houses, facing a small pond. The water in the pond is green. Trees are planted along the edge. The scenery is extraordinary. When the sons heard that guests had arrived, they respectfully went upstairs to offer tea, showing great politeness. Before long, Old Man Han arrived. He was short, vigorous, and his voice was loud. He spoke of his deeds of killing the enemy in those years, his eyebrows dancing with excitement. He pointed to a saber on the wall, wrapped in tattered red silk, and said, "This is the weapon I used to kill the enemy back then." He said, "I was just a small soldier. In the fifth year of the Guangxu reign, because of the Li Yangjing rebellion, I was stationed here with Feng Zicai. When the French attacked the pass, our weapons were too old. They had exploding cannons, so we were defeated repeatedly. On the one hand, it was also due to the lack of unified command. Later, when the French army occupied all the gun emplacements on the pass, Feng Gong and others vowed to fight them to the death. The generals held a meeting and decided on a battle plan. Wang Laohu led his troops to attack from behind Aikou. We dug pits and ambushed the entire large knife team. We attacked from both front and back. The French army completely collapsed. Many soldiers took off their hats and knelt on the ground, begging to be spared. Because too many of our brothers had died, we didn't spare a single one of them. I also killed many foreigners. It was really satisfying." As he spoke, he lifted his white beard, showing his pride. He also said, "Now I have seen through the world and don't want anything anymore. Lu Rongting asked me to be an official back then, but I definitely didn't go," and so on. After the conversation, he asked the old man to take a photo in the courtyard. On the gate was inscribed the four characters "老當益壯" (old but vigorous) by the magistrate of Pingxiang County, which perfectly suited his identity. He is truly a national hero of the older generation.</p>
<p>(29) Longzhou's Specialties and Scenic Spots</p>
<p>The reporter originally intended to tour the Longyuan Cave and Shuikou Nuosheng scenic spots, but due to lack of time, on the morning of the 18th, I was hastily given a tour of the city streets for a week, and at 10 o'clock, I set off to return to Nanning. The famous natural scenery such as the Kai Zixia Cave and Baiyu Cave are what crown Longzhou, but I was unable to visit them, which I deeply regret. Longzhou's streets are narrow, with about two or three hundred shops, mostly selling groceries. Its local specialties such as geckos, tuosnakes, tiger and leopard skins, and cinnamon are displayed for sale in various shops along the street. Geckos are a type of four-legged reptile, about four or five inches long, with a terrifying shape. According to the locals, geckos are extremely gentle and do not bite people. After they are captured, their internal organs are removed, dried in the sun, and soaked in wine. They can be eaten after a hundred days, and their function is to nourish yin and tonify. Gecko wine is famous throughout the country, it is said. There is also a type of tuosnake, the large ones can be several feet thick and tens of feet long, with a dark black or yellow color. They are often found in high mountains and do not harm people, but they are lecherous. They will chase after women when they see them. If someone holds a certain kind of vine and strikes them with it, they will become stiff. Snake catchers always use this method to catch them. They are sold in the market, and their meat is extremely delicious, and their gall can be made into medicine, which is extremely precious. There is also the so-called horse mane snake, which has the same body as a gecko, about a foot long, with a tail like a horse's mane, hence the name. Its shape is terrifying, and it is also said that it can be made into medicine. Zhongshan Park is located on the south bank of the Longjiang River, directly opposite the smoky households across the river. It starts from the iron bridge in the west, extends to 岝 Mountain in the east, borders Biaoying in the south, and reaches the riverbank in the north, covering an area of ​​about two thousand acres. Pavilions and towers are roughly scaled, and the Longjiang River flows through it, making it a natural beauty. However, because the park is large and there are not many tourists, it is becoming desolate, which is a great pity. The Su Yuanchun Gongbao ancestral hall can be seen everywhere in Longzhou, which proves that a good official's merits are judged after his death, and future generations will have their own public opinion.</p>
<p>(30) The Organization of the Guangxi Militia</p>
<p>The Guangxi militia has achieved remarkable results. Those who talk about Guixi's recent construction all believe that the militia is the hub for the progress of various fields. When the reporter arrived in Guixi, he repeatedly asked the responsible personnel in detail about the current situation of the militia organization and its efficiency, and personally went to various villages to visit and observe its actual situation. Along Nanning, Wuming, Longzhou, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Wuzhou, he investigated the militia training and district organization, and deeply felt that this systematic militia organization, which provides the people with universal military training, strengthens their physique, and makes the scattered and self-interested people accustomed to group life and promotes a spirit of unity, is indeed a good prescription for saving the country and surviving today. First, I will describe the current situation of the militia organization, and then I will successively record the situation of visits to various places, so that readers will have a clue. The Guangxi militia was founded in 1930, and its purpose was initially focused on self-defense, and gradually promoted its self-government and self-sufficiency policies. Therefore, it is said that the militia organization promotes construction in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects, and takes the implementation of the three policies of self-defense, self-government, and self-sufficiency as its mission. As for the organization methods, the Guixi authorities sought verification from practice at any time and modified them frequently. The whole province was divided into eight major militia regions. From 1930 to June 1932, it was divided into twelve regions. From July 1932 to June 1933, it was merged into six regions. In September 1933, it was changed to eight regions until now. The highest organ of the entire provincial militia was the Guangxi Militia Headquarters from 1930 to April 1932, the Group Training Office of the Guangxi Provincial Government from May 1932 to June 1933, and after July 1933, it was transferred to the Fourth Army Group Headquarters for handling. In May 1934, the Group Affairs Design Committee was established. In March 1935, the committee was abolished and the Group Affairs Office was established. The so-called eight major militia regions in the province are Nanning, Wuzhou, Liuzhou, Guilin, Pingle, Longzhou, Tianbao, and Baise. Each region is equipped with a militia region headquarters, with a chief and deputy region commander. Below are the militia headquarters of each county, with the county magistrate serving concurrently as the militia commander. The region commander has direct jurisdiction over the special service team, the standing team, and the militia cadre school. The county headquarters has direct jurisdiction over the reserve team and the preparatory team. The provincial government has the right to supervise the militia, so the region commander is additionally commissioned by the provincial government as an administrative supervisor. The county is divided into districts, townships (towns), villages (streets), and Jia. The reserve team and the preparatory team's joint team leader are concurrently held by the district chief. The reserve team and the preparatory team's battalion commander are concurrently held by the township (town) chief. The village (street) chief serves concurrently as the squad leader. The region commander concurrently serves as the administrative supervisor and the principal of the militia cadre school. The township (town) chief also serves concurrently as the principal of the national basic center school. The village (street) chief concurrently serves as the principal of the national basic school. Military, administrative, and educational affairs are integrated into one.</p>
<p>As for the team organization, it is divided into four types: reserve team, standing team, preparatory team, and civil servant military training team. (1) The reserve team is formed by all qualified able-bodied men in the province aged 18 to 45, as much as possible according to the convenience of their rural areas. (2) The standing team soldiers are collected from the total number of class A team soldiers of the reserve team in each county, according to the quota of recruits. (3) The preparatory team is formed by retired team soldiers from the standing team. (4) The civil servant military training team is formed by those in various places who have not received military training in the party, government, and military civil servants. However, those who are over 45 years old, or women, or have special circumstances, and have been approved, may be exempted from training or have their training postponed. As for the militia's expenses, they are entirely provided by the provincial treasury. The statistics show that the annual expenditure is about 2.2 million yuan. The number of militia who have been trained now is about 40,000 for the standing team and about 400,000 for the reserve team up to the fourth phase. As for the team training time, (1) the standing team is trained by the counties themselves, for a period of four months. When training is concentrated at the region headquarters, the time is extended to six months. (2) The preparatory team is convened by the county headquarters for training for one week each year, for a period of four years. (2) The reserve team is trained by the cadre training students and the team leader, and personnel are sent to inspect and supervise. Each team receives 180 hours of training. (4) The subjects and time required for the civil servant training team are the same as those for the reserve team. The instructors are appointed by the commander of the military group stationed in the area.</p>
<p>(31) Training Militia Cadre Talents</p>
<p>Regarding the training of militia cadre talents, there were previously (1) the Guard Cadre Training Institute, established in May 1931, which allocated a portion of the fourth-term students of the Guixi Military Academy and students who had passed the middle school graduation examination to enter the institute for eight months of training. After graduation, those with excellent grades were made members of the militia organization committee of each county, and the rest were training officers, totaling about 260 graduates. (2) The Tiannan Militia Training Institute, established in August 1931, was located in Tiannan (now the two regions of Baise and Tianbao), which was inconvenient to communicate with and had a large language difference. Therefore, it was established to meet the needs. After six months of training, the graduates were sent back to their place of origin to serve as officers or training officers of the standing team, totaling about 100 graduates. (3) The Militia Training Class, in February 1932, trained the militia organization committee members who had returned to the province and the officers who had passed the examination, dividing them into classes for training, totaling about 230 people. After a period of two months, they were assigned to various counties to serve as training officers. Those with qualified and excellent grades were also commissioned as deputy commanders or staff officers. (4) The Militia Cadre Training Team, in July 1933, ordered each district to instruct each county to select the incumbent township (town) and village (street) chiefs in batches to enter the team for training, with a fixed graduation period of six months. The subjects taught were mainly those that were relevant to their duties and practical for their concurrent duties. In order to enable them to also serve as principals or teachers of national basic schools, education theories were also added. Since then, the number of township (town) and village (street) chiefs who have received training in Guangxi Province has reached 12,793, of which 8,542 have graduated. (5) This year, in March, militia cadre schools were re-established in each district to enrich the academic knowledge of cadre talents. The district commander concurrently serves as the principal. The study period for students is divided into the following: A. High school graduates complete their studies in six months, and those who have completed military training complete their studies in three months, and must still train in technical subjects for four hours per week. B. Junior high school graduates complete their studies in ten months, and those who have received military training complete their studies in five months, and must add twelve hours per week in military academic subjects. Cadre training graduates who have completed the junior high school study period complete their studies in four months, and must still make up for three hours of technical subjects per week. Cadre training graduates who have not completed the junior high school study period complete their studies in twelve months, and must still add four hours per week in military academic subjects. C. Those who have studied in junior high school for more than one year or have equivalent qualifications complete their studies in eighteen months. The above categories are divided into seven types in total. According to the situation in each district, several types are selected and organized in batches. The incumbent township (town) and village (street) chiefs and the incumbent primary school principals or teachers in each county are given priority. Therefore, high school and junior high school graduates go to work in rural areas after cadre training. High school graduates serve as township (town) chiefs and principals of national key center schools, and junior high school graduates serve as village (street) chiefs and principals of national key schools, enriching the talent at the grassroots level. Only when the foundation at the bottom is solid can the efficiency of the militia be strong. Otherwise, even if orders are issued repeatedly and the surface is bustling, it will be nothing but a show and just for decoration, which does not conform to the purpose of being down-to-earth and working hard.</p>
<p>(32) Visiting the Militia District Headquarters</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, the reporter took a car to Wuming to visit the Nanning District Militia Headquarters and the militia situation in nearby villages. Zhang Tiemin, a member of the headquarters' group affairs office, was specially assigned to accompany me. The car arrived in two hours. The highway from Nanning to Wuming has the earliest history, built during the tenure of Lu Rongting, a native of Wuming. The private component is relatively high. Wuming has Lu Garden, which has the beauty of mountains, rivers, flowers, and trees. Unfortunately, the bridge was washed away by a flood, so I was unable to visit. Along the way, after passing through various villages, I got out of the car to observe. Most of the township offices are located in the market town. A market town is a place where markets gather. Each market town has a city gate-style surrounding wall. Several militiamen with guns are on guard at the entrances and exits. Larger villages have watchtowers outside the surrounding walls, with strict defenses. Many rural houses have slogans about organizing the militia, such as "The militia is the driving force behind Guangxi's construction," etc. Most of the township offices are located in old temples, and national basic center schools are also attached to them, with classrooms and playgrounds. Village offices are even simpler, moving the idols from the village's earth god temple and fire god temple to use as offices, and attaching national basic schools with students ranging from a dozen to dozens. The village chiefs are mostly high school and junior high school graduates who have undergone cadre training, so they are all young people in their twenties, full of energy, and have considerable knowledge. Unfortunately, the schools are on summer vacation, so I was unable to see them lecturing. The Nanning District Militia Headquarters is located in the suburbs of Wuming, taking Wuming as the center of the counties in the Nanning District. The district headquarters building is newly built, with a very wide area. The militia cadre school is attached to it. The militiamen on duty wear steel helmets, barefoot straw sandals, and clean clothes. The district commander, Liang Hansong, personally came out to greet me. Liang, whose courtesy name is Haochuan, is a native of Binyang, Guangxi. He is a graduate of the Baoding Military Academy and holds the rank of lieutenant general in the army. He has served as a division commander and other positions, and has a wealth of military knowledge. The walls of the reception room are covered with charts showing the number of militia and other items. Liang explained in detail, saying that there are 17 counties in the Nanning District, with a total of 5,449 township and village chiefs. About 2,000 of them have been trained, and it is expected that all cadre training will be completed within two years. In the Nanning District, the percentage of junior high school students who have received cadre training is 60% in the first phase, 90% in the second phase, and 99% in the third phase. The fourth phase has been universally completed. The third phase of training is about to begin, and it is scheduled to be concentrated in the militia cadre school on August 25. It is estimated that type A is for high school graduates, type B is for junior high school graduates, and those who have received military training is 1360, type C is for this year's junior high school graduates, who must receive six months of military training before they can be promoted to senior high. Those who are full high school students are about 400 people. The militia has been most effective in road construction. Two or three years ago, 200 miles of highways were opened to traffic in the Nanning District. Over the years, the militia has built roads voluntarily, and so far, more than 5,000 miles have been built. Fourteen of the seventeen counties can be fully opened to traffic. It is planned that the highways in the seventeen counties will be fully completed by the end of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e81">The Settlement of the Chaoshan Brown Sugar Registration Craze —Officials and Merchants Negotiate a Solution— <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Shantou News: The government's move to register Chaoshan Meiling brown sugar has aroused strong opposition from the people. All sectors of Chaoshan have sent representatives to the province to painfully explain the disadvantages and request its abolition. With the assistance of the provincial senators from various counties, the authorities have shown a willingness to change their minds. It is heard that Chen Jitang believes that the government's issuance of the registration order is intended to protect local products, and the intention is good. Therefore, both government orders and public opinion must be taken into account. He ordered the provincial state-owned material management office to negotiate with the representatives to find a compromise solution, so as not to conflict with government orders or harm the people, and sent Sun Jiaze, director of the three-province unified tax bureau, to assist in the resolution. Because Sun is a Chaoshan native, he knows more about the situation in Chaoshan, and he can indicate the advantages and disadvantages. In recent days, after several consultations between officials and merchants, the entire case has been resolved. Yesterday, the Shantou Brown Sugar Association received a telegram from the association's chairman, Lin Weiyan, who had come from the province, reporting the settlement process, saying that after Commander-in-Chief Chen ordered the representatives and Director Sun Jiaze to negotiate with the provincial state-owned material management office to find a solution, after several negotiations, as a result, a solution was decided on the afternoon of the 22nd, and both parties were satisfied with it. The solution is as follows: (1) The existing brown sugar in Shantou City will be investigated by the Shantou Brown Sugar Association together with the Chamber of Commerce within three days to complete the number of sugar stored by each merchant and sent to the Shantou Distribution Office for registration. When exporting, it can be transported freely. Only the Brown Sugar Association will send the customs declaration form to the management branch for verification and cancellation. There is no need to obtain an export permit separately. (2) Before October 20, the sugar stored in each county shall be investigated by the sugar associations of each county, who shall be responsible for investigating the number of sugar stored and sending it to the Shantou branch for registration. For counties that do not have a sugar association, the county chamber of commerce shall investigate and send it to the Shantou branch for registration. The registered sugar is allowed to be transported freely. For the sugar that is stored in the interior for marketing, only the number will be canceled, and the sugar association or chamber of commerce of each county will report it to the Shantou branch once a week. When the sugar transported for export arrives in Shantou, this association will handle it in accordance with the first method. However, unregistered sugar is not allowed to be transported and sold, etc. According to the above solution, the authorities have almost given up the principle of buying out. The registration procedures are also much simpler and easier. It is found that what all parties strongly opposed this time was the issue of buying out. Because if the registration item is not disturbing and the procedures are not difficult, then they will naturally obey. However, if the purpose of registration is to buy out, then the people will have no profit to gain, and their livelihood will be cut off, so they will rise up to oppose it. Now that the buying out method has been canceled, the Brown Sugar Association has telegraphed the sugar merchants in various counties to inform them. At the same time, the Shantou Branch of the provincial state-owned material management office has also received a telegram from the provincial management office, which has been forwarded to all relevant agencies and the Chao Customs. The Brown Sugar Association has scheduled a meeting of sugar merchants from Shantou City and various counties on the evening of the 25th to discuss the registration methods in accordance with the order. The opposition tide against the brown sugar registration, which had caused a huge wave, has been quelled.</p>

<p>The Sumu section of the Su-Fu Highway has been completed. The Su-Fu Automobile Company held an opening ceremony on the 25th.

<p>Zhou Hexi (Zonglian), a resident of Xiaoyuanli, Zhoushinzhen, the 253rd Tu, the third district of the county, is also the adopted grandson of Zhou Gu. Zhou Gu has an adopted daughter named Xingdi. The other day, Zhou Hexi suddenly brought a one-year-old maid named Chunxiang to the procuratorate of the district court to report that Zhou Gu's adopted daughter, Jidi, had given Chunxiang a packet of poison on the evening of the 23rd of the old calendar, instructing her to put it in the tea and let her four-year-old son, Tianrong, drink it. Tianrong died on the 25th. He requested that the police be sent to the countryside to search, arrest Zhou Gu and Xingdi and bring them to justice. After receiving the report, the procuratorate opened a court by Prosecutor Shen and questioned Zhou Hexi and Zhou Chunxiang in detail. A search warrant was issued immediately, instructing Judicial Captain Zhu Wanyuan to lead five bailiffs and Zhou Hexi to the countryside by car, together with the chief of the eighth branch of the public security bureau, the police and the Tu Zheng Jiang Shuanglong, to search Zhou Gu's house. However, no remaining poison was found. Zhou Gu, Zhou Xingdi, and Zhou Hexi were all brought to the court. Prosecutor Shen opened the court again. According to Zhou Gu and Zhou Xingdi, they did not poison Tianrong. They also claimed that Zhou Hexi had repeatedly tried to kill her mother and daughter. In the winter of the year before last, he even hired someone to shoot a gun and missed. He requested a thorough investigation. After questioning Zhou Hexi again, he was ordered to detain all three of them pending investigation. Tianrong's small coffin was handed over to Shan Gangzheng for safekeeping, while Zhou Quxi requested that his son Tianrong's coffin be transported to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination. Yesterday (the 31st), Prosecutor Shen summoned Tu Zheng Jiang Shuanglong to the court for questioning, asking whether the house and coffin were well guarded. Jiang replied that they were all well guarded. In the afternoon, at 4 p.m., Prosecutor Shen ordered the police to sign Zhou Hexi to the court and ordered him to pay a written guarantee of 2,000 yuan for bail, and then proceed with the investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Dung Manure Crisis Has Been Resolved <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The farmers of various vegetable gardens inside and outside the city walls of this county, due to their opposition to the Xieji Affairs Office monopolizing dung manure fertilizer, led to a strike by vegetable peddlers. Yesterday (the 31st), various small vegetable markets and street corners remained completely devoid of vegetable peddlers. The residents of the city became greatly alarmed, coupled with the fact that large and small latrine pits were overflowing with filth and excrement, threatening to spill into the streets or rivers, which would greatly harm public sanitation. County Magistrate Zhu Bao-xuan, in order to seek a swift resolution, specially summoned the responsible persons of the new and old dung manure businesses to the county office for a meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. A total of twenty-five representatives from the new dung manure businesses, including Zhou Zhi-rong, and nine representatives from the old dung manure businesses, including Lu Jin-bao, attended. The County Magistrate stated that since the new businesses had obtained licenses, they could legally operate; however, the organization of the Xieji Affairs Office was highly inappropriate and ordered it to be dismantled. Henceforth, each business should operate independently and should not engage in indiscriminate collective sales, which would cause trouble. The old dung manure businesses also held licenses and should not compete in business. Pit owners should be free to sell dung manure themselves, and no party should be allowed to monopolize or manipulate it. If similar incidents occurred again, both parties' licenses would be revoked. Furthermore, the "Wuxi County First District Agricultural Production and Marketing Cooperative" organized by Du Yong-xu's dung manure business outside the West Gate had not applied to the government for registration and permission, yet dared to privately collect a commission of twenty-five cents per dung manure boat, which was also inappropriate and should be dismantled. At the same time, a public notice was issued to reassure the vegetable garden farmers in the city to work peacefully, and vegetable vendors should also operate as usual, without causing unnecessary panic. Anyone found to be inciting trouble would be punished as a troublemaker. After the representatives were informed, they all obediently retreated. It is reported that this dung manure crisis was actually caused by competition between the new and old dung manure businesses. With the appropriate handling by the government, the crisis has subsided, and it is expected that vegetable vendors will resume business today.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Changshu: Shanghai-Wuxi Buses Add a Branch Station at the East Gate <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Wuxi highway to automobiles in this county, business has been extremely prosperous, and even inland commerce has shown signs of flourishing. Consequently, the business of local inns and restaurants has greatly increased. However, the bus station is located too far south, outside the South Gate, which is inconvenient for residents in the northeast area. Therefore, citizens Shen Shu-nan, Xu Cheng-zhi, and others have sent a letter to the Shanghai-Wuxi Automobile Company, requesting the establishment of a branch station near Sanli Bridge at the Great East Gate to benefit travelers. The company believes this is feasible and has approved its establishment, treating it as an agency. However, a certain amount of security deposit must be paid, and after both parties sign a contract, the station building can be constructed, and Shen will be appointed as the station manager. From now on, Shanghai-Changshu buses traveling in both directions must stop there, and travelers heading to Huaicheng in Changshu can disembark there, which will be more convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Jiangyin: Resident Water Police in Cheng Receive Orders for Reorganization <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Huang Tian-chi, the fourth district chief of the Water Public Security Team, received an order from Director Chen to reorganize the water police. On the 29th, Peng Xiang, a civilian inspection committee member, arrived in Cheng by boat from the province. Captain Yan of the Sixteenth Brigade led the team to welcome him to the team headquarters. The reorganization method involves reducing the five brigades in the fourth district (three along the Yangtze River and one along the Grand Canal) to four brigades. This is because the defense along the Yangtze River is currently peaceful, while bandit activity along the Grand Canal is unpredictable. The focus has shifted to the Huai River and the Grand Canal. The Sixteenth Brigade in Jiangyin is also among those being cut. After the reorganization, old and weak police officers will be dismissed. Thirty-two people will be laid off in Jiangyin.

The ministry has already replied, instructing the Liangzhe Salt Transportation Office to prevent it. The 350,000 yuan loan, with no source of repayment, has been effectively canceled.</p>

<h3 id="e92">President Wang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning for Medical Treatment and Meets with Kong Xiangxi and Huang Shao-xiong <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: President Wang of the Executive Yuan arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning to continue medical treatment and met with Finance Minister Kong and Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Huang Shao-xiong. He was originally scheduled to take the night train back to Nanjing at 11 PM to attend the burial ceremony of the martyr Liao Zhongkai. However, due to the unfinished procedures for his physical examination, which must continue today, his trip to Nanjing was temporarily cancelled last night and rescheduled for 11 PM tonight. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived at Hospital Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>President Wang boarded the night train from Nanjing the previous evening at 11 PM and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at 7:15 AM yesterday. Among those who came to welcome him were Wang Zhi-nan and others representing Yang Hu, the director of the Municipal Security Bureau. The area around the station was under strict security, personally supervised by Liang Fu-chu, the chief of the Xinzao Public Security Branch, along with the security team. After getting off the train, President Wang went directly to the Noel Hospital on Avenue Joffre for medical treatment. Those who arrived in Shanghai on the same train with President Wang yesterday morning included Yu Youren, the president of the Control Yuan, Chu Minyi, the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, and others.</p>
<p>Physical Examination and Meeting with Kong and Huang</p>
<p>President Wang arrived at Noel Hospital at around 7:40 AM yesterday. In addition to a follow-up examination and changing his medicine, he also had a physical examination, leaving the hospital at around 9 AM to visit Finance Minister Kong on Avenue Petain for discussions on financial matters. Then, at 10:45 AM, he returned to the Zeng residence on Rue Cardinal Mercier to rest. Huang Shao-xiong, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, who had just returned from Guangdong and Guangxi, visited President Wang at 10:50 AM to report on the recent situation in Guangdong and Guangxi and convey the opinions of the central committee members in Guangdong and Guangxi, holding a long conversation for over an hour before departing. President Wang then went out at around 11:20 AM to Noel Hospital for a blood test and continued his physical examination, returning to the Zeng residence in the evening to rest.</p>
<p>President Wang Receives Reporters Yesterday</p>
<p>President Wang received reporters at the Zeng residence on Rue Cardinal Mercier yesterday afternoon. According to him, he came here solely for medical treatment and will return to Nanjing tonight, with no other tasks. He mentioned that he had met with Chairman Huang and learned about the recent situation in Guangdong and Guangxi. Leaders in Guangdong and Guangxi have been exchanging telegrams frequently, and their attitudes are very good. The abolition of the Executive Yuan's Political Reorganization Committee in Beiping is simply because there is no need to set it up at present, with no other reasons. From now on, the provinces in North China will all return to administrative normalcy. As for the Military Affairs Committee, it will continue to operate as usual, and Chairman He will also return to the north within days to take charge of everything. Regarding the issue of economic cooperation between China and Japan, neither side has discussed it at all. The reports in foreign newspapers about the failure of the military campaign against bandits in Sichuan are definitely untrue.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the Queen of the Netherlands' birthday. The Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai and various Dutch merchants all took a day off to celebrate. The Dutch Consul-General originally scheduled a reception for foreign guests at his official residence at 5 Avenue Petain from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM.

<p>In mourning for the death of the Queen of Belgium, all agencies of the Municipal Government of this city will fly flags at half-mast today (the 1st). The Municipal Government has instructed all bureaus to comply. The Municipal Government's instructions are extracted as follows: "Approved letter from the Belgian Consul-General in Shanghai stating: 'Dear Sir, On the 29th of this month, Her Majesty the Queen of our country suddenly passed away, and the people of the whole country are deeply saddened. The Consul-General is deeply saddened and respectfully informs you,' etc. Therefore, in addition to separate orders, this order instructs all bureaus to fly flags at half-mast on September 1st to express mourning. This order." Lovat Fraser, the chairman of the acting board of directors of the Municipal Council, has sent a letter to Mr. Finfrock, the acting consul-general of Belgium in Shanghai, expressing condolences on behalf of all the staff of the Municipal Council for the death of the Queen of Belgium. The roof of the Municipal Council's administrative hall also flies at half-mast in mourning. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Shanghai Volunteer Corps previously appointed Captain Getter of the Scottish garrison as the corps' staff officer. As Captain Getter will be returning to England soon, he has expressed his unwillingness to assume the position, so the corps has now appointed Lieutenant Munro of the Lancashire Fusiliers to succeed him.</p>

A total of 38,460 yuan was approved. The committee will issue notification letters within days, instructing the applicants to go through the procedures to receive the loans.

<h3 id="e99">Import Tax on Foreign Rice Reduced Starting Today, Abundant Domestic Supply Due to Good Harvest, No Large-Scale Imports Expected <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: After our country and the French authorities signed the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement, according to the provisions of the treaty, both parties should implement reciprocity in commerce. Our country has accepted the French request and has decided to reduce the import tax on foreign rice starting today. The standard for the tax reduction has been studied by the National Tariff Commission and submitted to the ministry for announcement. The reduction is as follows: Saigon, Xiaojiao, Siam, Mintang, and other foreign rice, originally taxed at 1.50 customs gold units per 100 kilograms, are now taxed at 1.35 customs gold units. The surtax, originally taxed at 0.165 customs gold units, is now taxed at 0.135 customs gold units. The Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau wharf tax, originally taxed at 0.066 customs gold units, is now taxed at 0.055 customs gold units. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Inspector General of Customs and the Customs Superintendent to implement this starting today. According to news from the local rice industry, although the import tax on foreign rice has been reduced, our country has had a very good autumn harvest, with sufficient domestic supply, so no large-scale imports are expected.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Money Market Easing, No Problem for the End-of-September Hurdle <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency reports: The financial situation in this city, after concerted efforts from all parties, has improved recently. Therefore, even though it is before the end of September, the financial situation of the silver and money industry is not very difficult. The daily interest rate on foreign exchange has gradually decreased, standing at 15%. According to a person familiar with the financial market, speaking to a reporter from Shun Pao News Agency, the reduction in the daily interest rate is partly due to the easing of the market and partly to lower the reserve account for March, returning to 5.50 yuan. The money industry has seen a great easing of funds in the last ten days. Of the 25 million yuan previously owed to the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank, 2 million yuan has been repaid successively, and the reserve fund has reached more than 7 million yuan. The reason for not using the reserve fund to repay the 8.5% annual interest rate owed to the Central Bank, according to the deposit interest rate, is to avoid a repeat of the end-of-September hurdle, fearing that borrowing money at that time would be troublesome. Therefore, they would rather temporarily sacrifice small profits to consolidate the overall situation. However, if the daily interest rate continues to fall, the overall loss will be too great, and they may seek other repayment strategies. As for the end-of-September hurdle, based on current facts, it is hoped that it can be passed safely.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Rent Reduction Movement Publicity Week Closes Yesterday, Approves Proposals and Issues Declaration <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Rent Reduction Committee of the First Special District of this city, in order to promote the revitalization of the market and urge rent reduction, held a Rent Reduction Movement Publicity Week for one week starting on the 25th of last month. It closed yesterday at 4:00 PM at Tianhougong Bridge and approved important proposals and issued a closing declaration. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>The Special District Rent Reduction Movement Publicity Week held its closing ceremony at 4:00 PM yesterday at the committee's office at Tianhougong Bridge. Over two hundred representatives from various district branches, including Chen Jiufeng, Yu Yaoqiu, Liu Zhongying, Chen Binghui, Zheng Dongshan, Wang Jingdong, Luo Zheng, Pan Zhenxiang, Ge Futian, Wang Hesong, Zhang Xianfang, etc., attended. Li Ao-kui, Chen Jiufeng, Wang Jingdong, Yu Yaoqiu, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Xianfang, Wang Hesong, etc., served as the presidium. The chairman first gave a report, stating briefly that the committee held the rent reduction publicity week in order to urge rent reduction, and today marks the end of the week. Reducing rent is truly what the city's residents desire. Since the slogan of rent reduction was raised, a year has passed, and although some understanding landlords have voluntarily reduced rent, it has not been widespread, causing great impact on shops and residents. The committee stands on the side of the citizens' group, and resolving the citizens' suffering is an urgent matter. Therefore, although the meeting announces its closure today, the committee's responsibility has not been discharged. In the future, we must continue to work hard to achieve this goal to relieve the citizens' hardship.</p>
<p>Passing Proposals</p>
<p>After the representatives present spoke successively, the following proposals from various district branches were discussed: (1) Promote universal rent reduction movement and organize a mobile publicity team. Resolved: The propaganda department will formulate measures and submit them to the meeting for discussion. (2) Regularly send representatives to the Sixth Plenary Session to petition. Resolved: The standing committee will select representatives, and travel expenses will be raised by the representatives themselves. (3) Investigate the real estate owners and land values in this city. Resolved: Handled by the investigation department. (4) Statistics on the number of vacant houses in the city for reference by the Municipal Council. Resolved: Passed. (5) Continue to strive for a 60% rent reduction movement. Resolved: Print various slogans and distribute them for posting throughout the city. (6) Inform tenants in various districts that those who are unclear about rent reduction procedures can come to the Rent Reduction Consultation Office for inquiries. Resolved: Send letters to various branches to inform members. (7) Send a letter to the lawyers of the committee's legal advisory group stating that they should handle the committee's rent disputes on a pro bono basis. Resolved: Send a letter to the legal group. (8) Send a letter to the rent reduction branches in various districts to re-register with the committee to facilitate statistics. Resolved: Passed. (9) Issue a closing declaration of the meeting. Resolved: Passed. The rest is omitted.</p>
<p>Closing Declaration</p>
<p>The Rent Reduction Movement Expanded Publicity Week is closing today. The expansion of the rent reduction movement's publicity is nothing more than to make those who do not understand understand, and those who are not aware aware. Therefore, after the closing of the publicity movement, we should jointly take responsibility and work hard, fight against evil forces, so as to relieve the citizens' personal suffering, save the collapsing society, and gradually move towards its inherent prosperity. Shanghai is the most prosperous city in our country, and its land prices are the highest. Since the founding of the Republic of China, wars and bandits have plagued various provinces, and wealthy families have regarded Shanghai as a safe haven, investing in the real estate industry as a long-term plan, also believing it to be a speculative method of making profits. Therefore, demand exceeds supply, causing rents to be high. Since the Shanghai war, coupled with foreign economic aggression, cash has been almost completely absorbed, so even the most prosperous city feels panic. If we look back at the countryside, it is on the verge of bankruptcy, with disaster victims everywhere, even worse than Shanghai. The economic stagnation and the decline of the market can be imagined. How can landlords ignore the difficulties of the times, but only fatten themselves, resulting in an irreparable situation? As a result of the committee's week of publicity, we have been fortunate to receive the assistance of various parties. We still hope to continue unremittingly and work together. This is hereby declared.</p>

<p>Since the six directors of the Shipping Cooperative resigned and the cooperative was virtually dissolved, none of the agreed-upon plans have been realized. Private shipping companies, in order to seek self-rescue, have convened a general meeting to discuss full cooperation and actively organize rescue plans. The general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Cooperative Dissolution</p>
<p>The Shipping Cooperative was established in the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. Eleven directors were elected, originally intending to actively carry out a joint operation of the Yangtze River, coastal, and inner harbor routes, achieving the goal of coexistence and common prosperity and the first step towards regaining lost shipping rights. When it was established, the Ministry sent a special commissioner to guide it, and it was quite lively. Unexpectedly, it was like a flash in the pan, and it ended up doing nothing due to the lack of designated funds, unable to proceed as originally planned. The cooperative is nearing its end and has now notified all directors.</p>
<p>Private Shipping Meeting</p>
<p>After the dissolution of the cooperative, all private shipping companies felt that there must be a plan for the future of the business. Therefore, the Municipal Shipping Association convened all members to discuss future business plans for private shipping in order to seek rescue. In addition to resolving to stop supplying funds to business schools and other projects using the ship surcharge tax, and sending representatives to urge Yu Qiaqing to resume his position, it was also decided to actively advance business progress.</p>
<p>Design Committee</p>
<p>Private shipping decided to unite in spirit and seek self-rescue. It was decided on the spot to establish a Design Committee under the executive committee of the Municipal Shipping Association. The members of the committee will be hired from among the managers and staff of various shipping companies. The Design Committee is set at thirty-one members, to be hired by the executive committee. Their responsibilities are to improve work efficiency, concentrate the opinions of the industry, provide opinions from the Design Committee, investigate and collect statistics, study and improve business plans, and all matters related to the reform of the association. The Design Committee is also subject to matters discussed and entrusted by the executive committee, and meetings may be convened at any time.</p>
<p>Hired Committee Members</p>
<p>The Design Committee members who have been hired by the executive committee include Zhu Xiuting of Yiji Company, Zhu Angsheng of Hezong Company, Li Zhiyi of Sanbei Company, Zhou Zi'an of Datong Company, Shen Zhuxian, Wang Zicheng of Zhengji Company, Hu Zihou of Chuanshan Company, Chen Jisheng of Ping'an Company, Chen Renzheng and Lu Yuyang of Ningshao Company, Lu Yigeng of Dazhen Company, Lu Ruzhou of Chongming Company, Yao Shumin of Minxin Company, Xu Tingzuo of Yili Company, Huang Yongsi of Zhen'an Company, Zhang Shulin of Minsheng Company, Zeng Guangqing of Zhongtai Company, Feng Youxin of Zhaoxing Company, Yu Shunmao of Ningxing Company, Yang Guanbei of Dada Company, Ye Chuanfang of Huashang Company, Cao Zijia of Hong'an Company, Zheng Liangbin of Heng'an Company, Zhu Baochang of Chengtong Company, Liu Pingsun of Jufeng Company, Luo Lianchen of Huxing Company, and Xu Yihe, Cheng Yuqi, Zhong Shandao, and Zheng Weiru of Beifang Company.

Regarding the difficulty of canceling taxes in the Southwest, Guangdong merchant groups in Shanghai issued an official statement (lengthy text omitted), informing all sectors. Representatives from Hankou arrived in Shanghai today to jointly discuss countermeasures. The following are details gathered by a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao:</p>
<p>Joint Notice: Cessation of Business and Transportation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Oil Pressing Industry Association and the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association jointly issued a notice yesterday to manufacturers to cease operations and merchants to cease transportation, stating: "Dear Sirs, We recently received information from Guangdong that tax merchants are contracting to collect additional fees for the construction of Sun Yat-sen University on bean cake and peanut cake, starting on September 1st. This matter concerns the survival of our industry. Therefore, on August 30th, we convened a joint meeting of the third session of the Executive and Supervisory Committee of this Association, oil factory representatives, and transportation merchant representatives. According to the manufacturers and transportation merchants, it was decided that if the Guangdong Province tax merchants are determined to collect the cake tax starting on September 1st, the manufacturers will cease operations and the transportation merchants will cease transportation from that day onwards. Please notify the factories and transportation merchants to express their firm determination in unison, in order to attract the attention of the authorities. This has been discussed and passed on record. In addition to telegraphing the factories in Hankou, urging them to handle the matter in unison, we hereby urgently notify you to check and follow these instructions, and absolutely do not self-destruct, lest you be abandoned by your peers. This is of utmost importance. This notice is hereby issued on August 31st, the 24th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Telegraph Hankou to Quickly Dispatch Representatives to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Oil Pressing Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association telegraphed Hankou, urging them to quickly dispatch representatives, stating: "No. 61 Shengcheng Lane, Hankou, Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, your telegram received. We understand the Guangdong cake tax will begin on September 1st. The manufacturers and transportation merchants here, at a joint meeting yesterday, unanimously resolved to cease operations and transportation from that day onwards, vowing not to change. We earnestly hope that your office will handle the matter in unison, so as not to miss the opportunity, and also request that you quickly dispatch representatives to Shanghai to jointly petition in Beijing and Guangdong. When will you depart? We await your telegram reply. Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association respectfully asks. "It is now learned that three representatives from Hankou are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Representatives from Suzhou, Shantou, and other places have also set off for Shanghai to jointly discuss countermeasures and organize a petition delegation to petition in Beijing and Guangdong.</p>
<p>Telegraph the Central Government to Stop It</p>
<p>Oil cake, miscellaneous grain, and various merchant groups, in view of the Guangdong tax merchants' decision to increase the levy of additional taxes on flour starting on September 1st, repeatedly requested the Southwest authorities to stop it, but to no avail. Therefore, today they implemented a complete cessation of business and transportation and separately telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Guangzhou Municipal Government, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Department of Finance, and other agencies to strictly prohibit it. They also separately telegraphed the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, the Guangzhou Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association, the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, the North and South Ports Association, and other public groups to provide united assistance in order to achieve the goal of cancellation. The telegrams were sent out last night.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Southwest: Cancellation Difficult</p>
<p>Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang's representative office in Shanghai of the Guangdong Pacification Commissioner's Office, recently received telegrams from Zou Lu, the president of Sun Yat-sen University, and Qu Fangpei, the special commissioner of finance, stating: "(1) Zou Lu's telegram, Brother Dezhao, I acknowledge receipt of your telegram. The collection of additional construction fees for Sun Yat-sen University on flour is an order from the Political Affairs Committee for the Finance Special Commissioner's Office to handle. Merchants have already been invited to bid. Please investigate. Zou Lu. (2) Director Qu of the Department of Finance to Yang Dezhao, I respectfully acknowledge receipt of your telegram. The collection of additional construction fees for Sun Yat-sen University on imported flour fertilizer, at 25 cents per 100 catties, is an order from the Political Affairs Committee for the Special Commissioner's Office to handle. Merchants have already been invited to bid. The telegram has also been copied and sent to President Zou for review. Your humble brother, Qu Fangpu."</p>
<p>Report to the Social Affairs Bureau and Appeal for Relief</p>
<p>Zhu Jing'an, chairman of the Shanghai Oil Pressing Factory Industry Association, and Gu Sheng'yi, chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, jointly submitted a document to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "We have investigated that the essential fertilizers for farmers in our country, bean cake and peanut cake, which Guangdong Province calls bean flour and raw flour, were mostly supplied by the three northeastern provinces in the past. In recent years, Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wujin, Kunshan, and other places have successively established factories to manufacture them in response to the needs of the times. The raw materials are taken from the area north of Henan, Shandong, and Anhui. There are more than 20 factories in total, and tens of thousands of workers rely on them for their livelihood. Sales are unimpeded throughout the country, with Guangzhou and Shantou being the largest markets. However, Guangdong merchants and tax merchants, seeing the large sales volume as profitable, have repeatedly used the pretext of additional fees for the construction of National Sun Yat-sen University in 1932 and 1934 to secretly request the authorities to contract out the collection of taxes. All of these have been strongly opposed by the affiliated associations and factories in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wujin, Kunshan, and various groups related to Guangdong Province, and they were cancelled. First, on November 7, 1932, the 15th announcement of the Guangdong Finance Special Commissioner's Office stated, 'All soil fertilizers such as domestically produced bean flour and peanut flour in Guangdong and other provinces are exempt from additional fees.' And in May 1934, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee reiterated 'The order that only bean flour from the three northeastern provinces is subject to fees.' At the same time, Sun Yat-sen University and the Guangdong Finance Office jointly sent representatives to meet with the tax merchants to discuss and reply, 'In the future, flour transported to Guangdong, if not produced in the three northeastern provinces, will be exempt from additional fees.' There are clear cases and confirmed resolutions, and there should be no chance for a resurgence. Unexpectedly, in August of this year, tax merchants again contracted with the Guangdong Finance Office for flour, adding construction fees for Sun Yat-sen University, collecting 25 cents per load, regardless of the source of the goods. This is a violation of government orders and a burden on people's livelihoods. If you ask anyone, they will definitely say it is unacceptable. As soon as the news was released, all parties involved in the production and sales in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Kunshan, and Guangdong Province were shocked and informed each other, and letters and telegrams were sent requesting a stop. The affiliated associations also sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward telegrams to the authorities in Beijing and Guangdong, requesting that they be allowed to maintain the original plan, but to no avail. Moreover, it was confirmed that the tax merchants had decided to start collecting additional fees starting on September 1st, forcing oil cake factories everywhere and merchant groups in Guangzhou and Shantou to unite and decide to cease operations and transportation from that day onwards and fight for their rights in unison. At this time of extreme industrial and commercial depression, how can manufacturers and merchants bear this heavy burden? They do not hesitate to make huge sacrifices to take this action of ceasing operations and transportation, which shows that they have no other choice. Even in Guangdong Province, consider the recent telegrams sent by the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Association and others to the authorities in Beijing and Guangdong, which stated, 'In recent years, the rural areas have been depressed, and this summer, floods have spread everywhere. The people who cultivate the land have no way to save themselves. Suddenly, they hear of a heavy tax on fertilizer, cleverly using the construction fee for Sun Yat-sen University as a pretext. People's lives are already in danger, let alone talent. The situation is unfair and unreasonable.' This is enough to show that their situation is pitiful. From this, it can be seen that the tax on flour in Guangdong Province is unbearable for farmers, manufacturers, and merchants. It can be said that it is a disaster for all three. It is heard that Guangdong Province is vigorously implementing a three-year plan to abolish more than 40 kinds of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. Now, the flour tax harms farmers, industry, and commerce, which is even worse than exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies. Why is the order not followed, the established case abandoned, and it is implemented alone? The affiliated associations, in view of the difficult livelihood of the people, dare not remain silent. Therefore, they specially prepared a document and submitted it to you for review and approval, and quickly forwarded it to the municipal government to consult with the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, ordering the immediate cancellation of the case of the tax merchant contracting to collect additional fees on flour, in order to comply with the authority of the case and relieve the difficulties of the people. This is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the director of the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, Zhu Jing'an, chairman of the Shanghai Oil Pressing Factory Industry Association, and Gu Xingyi, chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, August 31st, the 24th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Telegraphed Requesting Exemption from the Flour Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Industry Association telegraphed yesterday to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group, the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Department of Finance, and other agencies, stating that bean and raw flour are the main fertilizers for sugarcane fields, which would increase the burden on sugarcane farmers, and requesting exemption from the additional tax. The original telegram stated, "(Titles omitted) Your province intends to levy additional taxes on domestically produced bean flour and raw flour. It has been found that there is an established case for exemption from this item. Before the ink is dry, the contractor is hastily allowed to secretly request it, which is causing panic. Moreover, bean and raw flour are the main fertilizers for sugarcane fields, which will increase the burden on sugarcane farmers and directly harm the bean and raw flour industry, and indirectly increase the cost of sugarcane. At this time, when foreign sugar is still being dumped and domestic sugar is just sprouting, it is like a pack of wolves attacking a sparrow, harming each other. We hereby specially telegram to request the cancellation of the bean and raw flour additional tax to avoid hindering the development of sugarcane. We beseech you to approve it. Shanghai Sugar Industry Association respectfully asks."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Shandong Flood Disaster; Please Invite Relief Representatives to Shanghai; Appeal to All Sectors for Relief; Report to Kong and Xu Separately <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Shandong flood victim petition delegation, Li Wenzhai, Wang Ziyu, Sun Lianquan, Chu Baoqing, Cui Baipeng, and five others, stated that the Yellow River flood this time, the extent of the disaster area, and the severity of the disaster situation are rare in hundreds of years. The area flooded in the entire province reached six million square li, with more than five million victims urgently awaiting relief like a spark. They specially departed from Jinan and arrived in Beijing a few days ago, separately calling on Premier Wang, Ye Chucang, Jiao Yitang, and others to petition for relief, and the results were extremely satisfactory. The representatives then took the night train from Beijing the night before and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, staying at the New Hui Central Hostel. At 4 p.m., they carried the petition and separately went to the Central Bank and Renji Hall to visit Minister Kong and Chairman Xu to report. They are scheduled to invite the city's press community in the coming days to appeal to all sectors for relief. The original presentation is recorded as follows: "Dear Sirs, the people of Shandong are unfortunately suffering a terrible disaster. On July 10th of this year, the Yellow River breached its banks in six places within the territory of Juancheng County, Luxi, with a breach width of more than 500 feet, diverting 70% of the flow eastward. Wherever the flood waves went, they were unimpeded. Dozens of counties, including Juancheng, Heze, Yuncheng, Juye, Jiaxiang, Jining, Jinxiang, Yutai, Dongping, Wenshang, etc., were flooded. By August 11th and 12th, the Yellow River's water volume suddenly increased, the original breach openings widened day by day, and civil dikes in various places successively collapsed, the disaster area expanded, and the disaster situation worsened. The area affected by the flood is 300 li east to west and nearly 300 li wide at its widest point from north to south, with a total area of approximately 60,000 square li. A total of more than 12,000 villages were affected within the area, with more than 5 million victims. The cultivated land that was flooded totaled more than 30 million official mu. The water level in the plains of various counties reached the rooftops in deep areas and over the knees in shallow areas. Farmers' property was completely swept away by the flood, and the population and livestock were all trapped in the giant flood. The total amount of loss of life and property is so huge that it cannot be clearly investigated in a short period of time. In addition, Zhangqiu, Huantai, Wancheng, Tengxian, Linqing, Guanxian, Dexian, Xintai, Guantao, and other nine counties were flooded one after another due to overflowing lakes, breaching riverbanks, or mountain floods, and the disaster situation was extremely tragic. The severity of the situation is even greater than the drought in Shaanxi in 1929 and the Yangtze River flood in 1931. As for the rescue strategy, it is nothing more than immediate relief and fundamental treatment. First, in terms of immediate relief, the victims who died in the water are drifting with the waves, countless. Those who died of hunger and disease are also lying in the fields, exposed without anyone to collect them. Except for those who have already entered the bellies of fish and turtles or have been eaten by wild dogs, all have rotted and are unbearable to look at. If they are not buried as soon as possible, the epidemic will be imminent. Those victims who were fortunate enough to survive have taken the high places as their homes, moving and resettling every day, without food to eat, without clothes to cover their bodies, without houses to live in, and without carts to move. They can only sob and live on, bowing their heads and waiting for death. Moreover, the autumn wind is getting stronger and the frost is approaching. Looking forward, they do not know where they will die. Although the Shandong Provincial Government and various charitable relief organizations have tried their best to provide relief, it is a drop in the bucket, with limited relief. We still hope that our government authorities and people from all walks of life will show their concern for hunger and drowning and promote the amount of compatriot assistance, quickly gather huge sums of money, and provide immediate relief to save the lives of more victims, which is to retain a portion of the country's vitality. This urgent relief work cannot be delayed for a moment. Secondly, in terms of fundamental treatment, plugging the breach is the only important task. However, according to reports, the breach plugging committee, regarding the survey and assessment of plugging the breach, deliberating on repairing branch roads, and allocating vehicles to transport materials, all require funds and time. Even if they are actively carried out, construction will have to wait until next spring. When will it be plugged? It is even harder to predict. The flood period is long, and the water keeps coming. If the breach is not plugged for a day, the flood will not recede for a day, and the farmland will not recover for a day. This year's wheat planting has been hopeless, and what about next year's spring plowing? It is also difficult to say. Millions of victims are groaning in a dilemma and in a situation where life and death are difficult. The old and weak cannot take care of themselves and are not worth worrying about. If the young and strong are unwilling to sit still and take risks, become bandits, and then lead each other to destroy the soon-to-be-bankrupt rural areas, harming the society and the country together, the speed may exceed the severity of the flood. This breach plugging work must be urgently pursued. In short, doing urgent relief to save the present and plugging the breach to treat the root cause are both important and cannot be ignored. However, both require a large amount of money to be effective. We have always admired your society's concern for suffering and compassion. We sincerely ask you to have pity on the survivors of the disaster, strongly support and quickly provide relief, which is a public virtue and a benefit for both. Sincerely yours, Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces." Yesterday (August 31), this newspaper received donations for flood relief in various provinces, including 50 yuan from Mr. Yueqiande Fen, 15 yuan from Mr. Xu, 10 yuan each from Langji, Mr. Han Qingqing, and Mr. Zhang Zhenhua, 10 yuan jointly donated by Mr. Zhang Pingzhi and Hongzhi, 5 yuan from Hengfeng Company, 4 yuan and 6 jiao from Mr. Wang Yongxiang, 2 yuan each from Mr. Cao Zeng, Mr. Cheng Mingzheng, and Miss Cheng, 2 yuan from elementary school student Shen Chengru (saving candy money to help disaster victims, original letter attached), and 1 yuan each from Yi Bai, Mr. Ma Shaoyun, and Mrs. Ma, totaling 125 yuan and 6 jiao. In addition, Mr. Fanju submitted a fixed deposit slip No. 1008 from the Jiande Savings Association (due on August 3 of this year, with a total principal and interest of 1,000 yuan). The original letter from elementary school student Shen Chengru is also published below: "Dear Editor, Lately, I often see in your newspaper advertisements such as 'Donate one more penny to save one more life,' and in the latest issue of the pictorial, photos of the flood situation, all kinds of tragic situations, truly make me feel very sad. Therefore, I and my three younger brothers have accumulated the candy money that our father gives us every day, and now we have saved 2 yuan, please first hand it over to the disaster relief association, and we will continue to do so in the future, because my family does not have much money to save the disaster, so we can only find a way in the candy money for me and my younger brothers. But with our strength, it is very small, and we still hope that the children of each family will implement it in unison, and everyone will work hard to save the disaster and get a few more pennies, then we can save a few more lives. The following is omitted. Respectfully, Shen Chengru, a ten-year-old elementary school student, August 31st."</p>

<p>After the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company purchased the Haiyun cargo ship (formerly Hongyuan) from France and arrived in Shanghai, it was immediately sent to the Gaochangmiao Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. It was decided to operate between Shanghai and Lianyungang, specializing in transporting goods linked to the Longhai Railway. General Manager Liu Hongsheng has agreed with Shen Shuyu of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to use the Haiyun ship as collateral to borrow 150,000 yuan in national currency. The contract has been signed and approved by the Ministry of Communications. It is stipulated that each time the Haiyun sails, the water freight income will be used to repay the principal and interest, with a very short term and reduced interest. The ship has a total tonnage of 5,600 tons. The loan borrowed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is to make up for the temporary filling in of the deficiency when purchasing from France earlier.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Shipping Industry Association Requests the Ministry to Stop Collecting Additional School Ship Levy <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications to stop collecting the additional school ship levy, stating: "The shipping industry is increasingly declining, borrowing is exhausted, the current situation is difficult to maintain, and it is unable to pay the additional school ship levy. We respectfully request your inspection and approval to stop the levy, so as to lighten the burden and strive to extend life. In 1929, the shipping merchants were honored to have the Ministry send personnel to discuss with the merchants and reluctantly bear 30% of the tonnage-based additional school ship levy. At that time, it was because it was related to cultivating talent that they had to bear the pain and burden. Moreover, at that time, shipping was smooth and shipping merchants' business could still be maintained, so they could unanimously agree and happily contribute. However, since the collection of this additional levy, the shipping industry has gradually declined. By the winter of 1932, due to frequent disasters, decreasing production and sales, and reduced transportation, the shipping industry was depressed, so that the business income was not enough to cover expenses. The shipping merchants were all unable to bear the previous additional levy and asked the association to request the cessation of the levy. The association has repeatedly stated the difficult situation three times on October 8, October 26, and November 17 of that year, appealing with exhaustion, but it was still not granted. They bore the pain and endured it for three years. Today's situation is even more different than it was three years ago. The rural areas are bankrupt, all industries are sluggish, and more and more transport ships are being abandoned and parked because there is no cargo to load, and more and more companies are ceasing operations due to debt pressure. The shipping merchants have suffered terrible hardships to this point, which is unprecedented in previous years. The difficult situation cannot be fully described. The facts are all there, and they have already been seen by the Ministry. The shipping merchants are in this environment, and borrowing is exhausted, and there is no way to deal with it. It is very difficult to maintain the current situation. According to the repeated requests of the members, it was brought up for discussion at the 34th Executive Committee meeting. It was generally believed that the shipping industry was affected by the market and was even more declining. In order to seek a way to deal with the current situation, there was no other way but to tighten things up. The additional school ship levy has been reluctantly borne by the shipping merchants since November 1929, and it has been six years, and the accumulated amount has been huge. Moreover, since the establishment of the Maritime Administration, the burden on the shipping merchants has become heavier. Now that they cannot even protect themselves, they are absolutely unable to pay this additional levy again. All the expenses of the school ship should be allocated by the government separately. It is believed that the Ministry has witnessed the decline of the shipping industry and has fallen into a desperate situation. According to reason, it must be unbearable to continue to order the dying shipping merchants to continue to bear this extra levy to increase their burden. The association should immediately submit a request to the Ministry of Communications to quickly approve the cessation of the levy and declare that it will stop paying at the latest by the end of December of this year. It is requested that the Ministry show understanding and give it a full completion. The above opinions were unanimously resolved and recorded. Therefore, this document is submitted, requesting inspection and approval, and that the funds for the school ship be allocated separately, and that the additional school ship levy of 30% of the tonnage levied from the shipping merchants be stopped, so as to lighten the burden and strive to extend life. With the utmost fear, we await your command, and respectfully submit it to the Ministry of Communications."</p>
<h3 id="e110">The Consulate in Kobe Replied by Telegraph: The Crew of the Hua Wu Ship is Safe; All the Shipwrecked Crew Members are Temporarily Being Rescued by the Japanese; The Company Authorities Sent Personnel to Japan to Handle the Aftermath <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After the Hua Wu ship of the Nanhua Shipping Company encountered a hurricane and ran aground off the coast of Mie Prefecture, Japan, the company authorities specially telegraphed the Consulate General in Kobe to investigate. The ship only ran aground and could not sail, but the crew members were safe and being rescued by the Japanese. The company will send representatives to Japan to handle the matter. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegraph Request for Investigation</p>
<p>Since the Hua Wu ship encountered a hurricane and ran aground on August 28 while sailing from Yokohama to Shanghai, it was impossible to confirm whether the ship had sunk and whether there were any casualties among the crew members, causing the company and the families of the crew members to be extremely alarmed. Therefore, Liu Shisun, the manager of the company, telegraphed Jiang, the Consul General of our country in Kobe, Japan, the night before to investigate the truth about the Hua Wu accident, stating: "To Jiang, the Consul General of the Republic of China, our Hua Wu ship encountered danger at sea in Shukutasou Village, Watarai County, Mie Prefecture, Japan. Please investigate and reply by telegram in detail. Nanhua Shipping Company, No. 353 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai."</p>
<p>Consulate Reply</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. yesterday, Nanhua Company received a reply telegram from our country's Consulate General in Kobe, Japan, stating: "The Hua Wu ran aground, cannot sail, the captain and others are all safe, but they will return in advance, and are now temporarily being rescued by the Japanese. The return travel expenses and rescue expenses total approximately 3,000 Japanese yen. If you want to return first, please telegraph the remittance immediately. Please send personnel to Kobe to handle how the ship will be handled. We hope you will reply to the consulate by telegram." Therefore, the company informed the China Ship Joint Insurance Company of the situation in the consulate's reply telegram.</p>
<p>Dispatch Personnel to Japan</p>
<p>After the crew members' families heard the news of the ship's accident, they were unusually panicked and went to the office at No. 353 Jiangxi Road for days to inquire about their whereabouts. After the Kobe Consulate's reply telegram arrived in Shanghai, they all turned their worries into joy and were deeply grateful for the misfortune. The company authorities decided to send two staff members by ship to Japan to handle the return travel expenses of the crew members and the Hua Wu's aftermath procedures, and then transfer to the scene of the accident to investigate the truth before reporting to the insurance company for compensation.</p>
<h3 id="e111">City Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Request Clarification on Stamp Tax Ambiguities <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministry of Finance requesting clarification regarding ambiguities in the new Stamp Tax Law. The cable reads: "Respectfully to the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, since the Stamp Tax Law was implemented on schedule, various industries, out of prudence, have repeatedly inquired about ambiguities. Those based on clear articles or precedents in Ministry documents can be answered immediately. As for situations involving slight ambiguity, out of prudence, we should immediately cable Your Ministry for instructions. Here are several ambiguities for your consideration: (1) Exemption from stamp tax for workers' wage account books and registers, based on Article 16, Clause 4 of the Stamp Tax Law tariff schedule. This provision originally followed the principle of Article 4 of the Stamp Tax Law principles set by the Central Political Council, intending to support agriculture and industry. Small business partners and staff, in terms of their employment relationship, are no different from workers. Can this provision be applied to the wage account books and registers of business partners and staff? Besides the exemption for wage account books and registers, should similar reward registers used for year-end bonuses also be exempt in order to encourage savings and support the livelihood of employees? We respectfully request Your Ministry's instructions on this matter. (2) In the past, invoices, regardless of the value of the goods, were affixed with a 1-cent stamp. Now, the stamp duty varies from 1 to 3 cents depending on the value of the goods, so the application of tax rates is subject to discussion. When merchants send goods to customers for sample viewing and selection, they must send several items for selection. The delivery notes used cannot be regarded as invoices until the customer selects and retains some items without a separate invoice. Therefore, two questions arise: (a) According to the above situation, the stamp duty should not be affixed when the delivery note is issued but when the customer selects the goods, finalizes the transaction, and no separate invoice is issued. The time of affixing the stamp should be clearly defined. (b) The stamp duty should be based on the value of the goods selected and finalized, not including the total amount on the delivery note for goods not selected and returned. For example, if the delivery note is valued at 110 yuan, and the goods selected and finalized are only 70 yuan, while the goods returned are valued at 40 yuan, then the stamp duty should be affixed at 2 cents according to the 70 yuan value, not 3 cents for the 100 yuan rate. We respectfully request instructions on these two points. (3) There is no difference between businesses that purchase goods from others and sell them and those that manufacture goods themselves and sell them. Therefore, factories and distribution centers should not be regarded as branch and head office relationships. We have already cabled Your Ministry for instructions, but have not yet received a reply. Furthermore, for department stores and the like, sales are categorized, such as notifications between the silk and stationery departments, which are regarded as internal to the same organization. However, if the company also has a hotel and restaurant at the same location, and these businesses were included in the same registration certificate, should the notifications between them also be regarded as for internal use? We respectfully request Your Ministry's instructions on this matter. We earnestly request a prompt decision on the above situations and a reply by telegram for compliance, as this is in the public interest. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, respectfully, [Date]."</p>

<h3 id="e113">Hezhong and Dazhen Companies Cooperate to Operate Shanghai Shipping; Longhai Railway Bureau Approves Implementation on the 16th <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News reports that the privately-owned Hezhong and Dazhen shipping companies will cooperate to operate Shanghai shipping routes, approved by the Longhai Railway Bureau, and will be implemented on September 16th. Dazhen has also newly opened a Guangdong-South shipping route, dispatching the Yongping and Yongan ships. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cooperative Operation of Shanghai Shipping</p>
<p>After the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Longhai Railway implemented intermodal transportation of goods by water and land, and designated Lianyungang as the connecting point, they dispatched special ships to operate between Shanghai and Lianyungang to load intermodal cargo. The business of the privately-owned Hezhong and Dazhen companies operating between Shanghai and Dapu was greatly affected. Moreover, the Lianyungang wharf has been completed, and goods along the Longhai Railway have been transferred from Dapu to Lianyungang for transshipment, resulting in a sharp decrease in cargo at the Dapu wharf. Now, the two companies are cooperating and have reached an agreement with the Longhai Railway Bureau that all non-intermodal cargo along the Longhai Railway will be transported by the two companies, with Lianyungang as the transshipment wharf. A joint general office will be established in Shanghai, with branch offices in Lianyungang, Dapu, and Xinpu, and directors will be selected to oversee all cooperative matters.</p>
<p>Railway Bureau Approves Implementation on the 16th</p>
<p>The Hezhong and Dazhen cooperation stipulates six ships: Hezhong's Zhengzhou (1,333 tons), Haizhou (1,658 tons), and Xuzhou (1,471 tons); and Dazhen's Yongji (1,847 tons). Because the Yongping and Yongan ships are of unsuitable tonnage, two equivalent ships are being purchased to replace them. Originally scheduled to be implemented today, it has now been extended to the 16th with the approval of the Railway Bureau. The original letter is as follows: "Your submission of August 24th stating that the ships are undergoing repairs and cannot set sail as scheduled, and requesting a temporary postponement of half a month, has been noted. In addition to instructing the Hong Kong office to be informed, this is a special reply for your information. To: Hezhong and Dazhen Shipping Company, Longhai Railway Administration."</p>
<p>Dazhen Opens New Guangdong-South Shipping Route</p>
<p>Dazhen Company, considering that the Yongping and Yongan ships (1,421 tons each) are not suitable for operating on the Shanghai-Lianyungang route, has decided to open a new Guangdong-South shipping route for regular voyages to Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Haikou, and Beihai, primarily for cargo and passengers. The passenger fares will be calculated according to the fares of the British Swire Company ships operating on that route. The Yongping ship has been repaired by Jesong Dockyard in Dongjiadu and certified by the British Corporation Register of Shipping. It is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong from Shanghai on the 3rd to obtain a passenger license before sailing. The Yongan ship will undergo repairs in the dockyard upon its return to Shanghai, and is expected to join the route by the end of September.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Inspection Law, requires imported flour to be inspected. The detailed rules for flour inspection have been formulated. The Tianjin and Qingdao Inspection Bureaus will conduct the inspection first. Other inspection bureaus will be opened on schedule after preparations are completed. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau actively prepared and is now ready. The necessary procedures with the Customs have also been agreed upon. It has been determined to begin inspecting imported flour starting today (September 1st). From now on, flour imported through Shanghai will not be allowed to be declared for import without passing inspection. The Bureau has sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to inform the industry and published a notice for general awareness.</p>

<p>Xinsheng News reports that the directors of the International Problems Research Association hosted a dinner at the Banking Club the other day to welcome Mr. Moore, President of the League of Nations Association of the United States of America, and Messrs. Talbott and Handsaker, representatives of the U.S. National Defense Council. Those present included Chairman Chen Zheqing, Executive Director Guo Bingwen, Directors Li Zhaohuan, Liu Zhanen, Cao Yunxiang, Dai Zhiqian, etc. Guo Bingwen delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the Association, followed by speeches from the three guests. They stated that they came to inspect the actual situation and collect data due to the repeated threats to peace in the Far East for the research of their national organizations. Mr. Talbott further stated that the United States' attempts to maintain world peace began as early as thirty years ago. The late President Roosevelt had initiated the idea of the League of Nations, and Taft had organized and implemented the League to Enforce Peace. Wilson drafted the Covenant of the League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference, but it was opposed by conservatives at home, resulting in the founding country withdrawing from the League, greatly impacting the international organization. This has led to a state of international turmoil and disputes today, disregarding various conventions, and threatening world peace. While aggressor nations are enemies of peace, the United States cannot escape responsibility for the result of America's non-participation in international organizations. Currently, there are groups in various countries that advocate international peace and international organizations, but their strength is weak and ineffective.

<h3 id="e119">The Case of Lei Wen et al. Was Heard Yesterday in the American Court; Each Was Released on Bail of 10,000 Yuan in Cash <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Greater American Evening News reports that today (August 31st), American Magistrate Watson prosecuted Lei Wen, former General Manager and Director of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, Bai Lang, Vice President and Director, and Te Lisikeer, Secretary and Accountant, for fifteen counts of embezzling bank funds. Chief Judge Hillmik of the United States Court for China ordered Breven to pay a bail of US$10,000, Bai Lang also US$10,000, and Te Lisikeer US$5,000. Lei Wen and Te Lisikeer arrived at the court before noon in compliance with the summons. Mr. and Mrs. Keli Fei'er, Vice President and Manager of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, also arrived. Mrs. Keli Fei'er agreed to pay the bail for Te Lisikeer, subject to the approval of Chief Judge Hillmik. Shortly after noon, Lei Wen and Te Lisikeer were taken to Xiamen Road for lunch, but were permitted by Officer Bobelt to communicate freely with people. At the same time, Mr. and Mrs. Keli Fei'er went upstairs to wait in Hillmik's office for his decision. Hillmik soon approved Mrs. Keli's signed bond of 10,000 yuan, with the Keli's residence as security. Soon after, Lei Wen also paid the bail of 10,000 yuan, which was an immediate check from the Chase Bank. Thus, both were released. It is reported that the case will be heard in a preliminary hearing next week. If the charges against them are true, the maximum penalty for each count will be a fine of 1,000 yuan and imprisonment for ten years. At the same time, Magistrate Watson has telegraphed Philippine Governor Murphy to detain Bai Lang Feng, the custodian of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation in Manila, for secret interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Bizarre Debt Case; Old Files Contain Return Receipt; Plaintiff Claims it Was Fraudulently Obtained; Debtor Arrested and Taken to Court; Plaintiff Then Defends Him <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Ma Huanwen of Nanjing borrowed 3,100 yuan from Yuji Bank, a shareholder of Laozha Bridge, in February of the 13th year of the Republic, with Yang Guanqi, a shareholder of Laozha Bridge Yuji Bank, as guarantor. The bank subsequently closed in the 15th year of the Republic, and the shareholders publicly appointed Jin Weiyu, a local resident, as the manager to liquidate the accounts. Jin, in his capacity as the legal representative of the bank, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic, engaging lawyer Weng Zhifan to seek the return of the loan. After three trials, the court ordered Ma Huanwen to return the full amount, plus interest at 2% per annum from April 13th of the 13th year of the Republic until the end of the execution, and the execution of the case began. The debtor Ma Huanwen suddenly fled without a trace. In June of this year, the creditor Jin Weiyu again engaged lawyer Gu Kenfu to file a request with the court to arrest the debtor and continue compulsory execution. The execution court recently approved the subpoena for review, learning that the case had been settled on April 10th of the 22nd year of the Republic by the debtor paying 1,000 yuan in cash and a 2,000 yuan check from the Anhui Bank in court. The recipient at the time was Yang Guanqi, with an attorney's letter signed by Jin Weiyu and a receipt for the payment signed by Yang Guanqi attached to the file. After the court presented it to Jin for review, Jin claimed that the attorney's letter was not signed by him, and he was unaware of the settlement. This act of forging an attorney's letter and fraudulently obtaining the payment was done by Yang Guanqi. After adjourning, he and lawyer Gu reported to the Huizhen Police Station and requested the court to issue a warrant, which was subsequently arrested. The police charged Yang with fraud and suddenly defended Yang. The court, finding that his statements differed significantly from his accusations and contradicted the evidence on file, deemed it suspicious and ordered the defendant to pay a guarantor of 500 yuan and rescheduled the hearing. The case was reheard the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Li Zhishan immediately stated that the plaintiff's testimony in court was mostly untrue. He deliberately defended the defendant. There may be other reasons. He requested that lawyer Gu Kenfu, who accompanied the plaintiff to the police station to file the report, be brought to court to testify. The investigating magistrate then ordered lawyer Gu to stand in the witness box. He testified that the plaintiff's sudden reversal was due to gangsters interfering. The plaintiff had repeatedly stated his intention to prosecute the defendant in the execution court and the police station. The lawsuit and attorney's letter submitted to the Civil Execution Office requesting the arrest of the debtor were all signed by him in person. However, when the defendant was arrested, he was beaten by several gangsters and had reported it to the prosecutor's office to be examined by a forensic doctor and will file another lawsuit. The gangsters illegally beat people and threatened litigation parties, and the court should investigate them strictly. Police lawyer Li Zhishan immediately stated that the police had repeatedly sent summonses to the plaintiff for questioning, but they could not be delivered. Whether there was any suspicion of false accusation or perjury, the police would investigate and requested that the plaintiff be released on bail. The court then ordered Jin Weiyu to pay a guarantor of 200 yuan and await police investigation. Yang Guanqi was temporarily released on the original bail, and the hearing was rescheduled for next Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Huizhen Police Station Arrested Counterfeit Coin Offenders; As Many as Nine Men and Women; Re-examination Rescheduled for the 4th of this Month <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Huizhen Police Station arrested nine suspects in the counterfeit coin case, Dong Zuhe, Dong Zhou's wife, Wang Lu's wife, Wu Wang's wife, Huang Wang's wife, Wang Wentong, Wang Yan's wife, Wang Asheng, and Zhang Wang's wife, from Ningbo, in various locations such as Qipu Road and Hambi Road the night before last. Two hundred and six counterfeit double dimes, one thousand seven hundred and thirty copper coins, nine genuine double dimes, a box of printing mud, a can of sand powder, and stamps and smoking paraphernalia were seized and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the police requested approval for detention for further investigation. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin then rose to describe the details of the case, stating that at 8:30 PM last night, Dong Zuhe and Dong Zhou's wife went to Yezhi Tobacco Paper Store at 237 Qipu Road to exchange a double dime for copper coins. The store owner, Ye Qing, discovered that it was a counterfeit and negotiated with them, which led to a dispute. At that time, Qian Hanzhang, the owner of a nearby tobacco paper store at 203, heard the noise and came forward, noticing that the Dong couple had also used a counterfeit dime at his store. He called the police and had the Dong couple arrested. Unexpectedly, Dong suddenly took out an envelope and threw it away. It was retrieved and opened, containing nine counterfeit double dimes and thirteen genuine double dimes, which were taken to the police station. Chinese and Western detectives interrogated them about the origin of the counterfeit dimes. Dong confessed that they were bought from Wang Lu's wife at 438 Hambi Road. The police went and arrested her. She confessed that her counterfeit coins were bought from Wu Wang's wife at 3, Lane 257, Jie Road, for ten counterfeit double dimes per yuan, and resold to Dong for fifteen per yuan. Detectives went to 3, Lane 257, Jie Road, and arrested Wu Wang's wife and Huang Wang's wife in the front building, seizing one hundred and twenty-two counterfeit dimes and five hundred copper coins for printing. In the kitchen next to the building, Wu Wang's wife's brother, Wang Wentong, and Wang Yan's wife (Wang's wife) were arrested, and seventy counterfeit dimes and nine hundred copper coins were seized. At that time, Wu Shi confessed that these double dimes were not made by her. Because she had a smoking habit, she went to the Swallow's Nest upstairs at 165 Gansu Road every day to smoke, and Jiang Peiyuan sold her counterfeit double dimes for twenty per yuan. The detectives went to the Swallow's Nest to arrest Jiang Peiyuan without success, only arresting Wang Asheng and Zhang Wang's wife, who opened the Swallow's Nest, and seized two cans of plaster powder for making counterfeit coins, an iron pot for melting lead, and smoking paraphernalia, and brought them back to the police station. Because the investigation procedures have not been completed and it was discovered that Wang Asheng had been punished three times before for the crime of using counterfeit coins, it is requested that they be detained. Judge Wu Zehan interrogated each of the accused and ordered that Huang Wang's wife, whose crime was relatively minor, be allowed to be released on bail and be available for questioning at any time. The rest were all approved for separate detention and re-examination on the morning of September 4th.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Shareholders of China Industrial Bank Sue Liu Huizhi for Embezzlement; List Eight Counts of Criminal Facts; Both Plaintiffs and Defendants Were Absent Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Liu Huizhi, the president of China Industrial Bank, has been residing at 1321 Xinzha Road since resigning from his position. He was once sued by a shareholder of the bank for embezzling bank funds while in office, but it was quickly settled out of court, so the contents of the accusation were never publicly investigated by the court. Now, Zhang Chongfu, another shareholder of the bank, has also filed a criminal self-suit against Liu for embezzlement and breach of trust. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special District Local Court held a hearing. Both the plaintiff and defendant claimed to be ill and were absent, and each engaged a lawyer to represent them in court. First, plaintiff's lawyer Chen Yingsheng stated that the plaintiff, Zhang Chongfu, is a shareholder of China Industrial Bank with ten shares, each share with a capital of 100 yuan. Because the defendant had embezzled bank funds, Zhang filed a self-suit for the benefit of the company and his personal interests. The defendant's lawyer, Shan Yuhua, then presented a judgment from the First Special Court for Liu Huizhi's self-suit in another case, stating that it could prove that the facts of this case were the same as that case. Hearing this, lawyer Chen immediately requested the court to allow him to read the judgment and then stated that this judgment was based on the withdrawal of the self-suit by the plaintiff. It shows that the substance of the case was not investigated, and whether the facts are the same as this case cannot be certainly affirmed because this case has not been tried either. However, the criminal acts of the defendant in this case are numerous, totaling eight counts, and the amount of money he embezzled is considerable. Judge Liu then stated that because both parties had not personally appeared in court, it was impossible to begin the trial and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for the afternoon of September 10th.</p>

<p>Gu Hongtai, also known as Li Zhan, from Jiading, is 21 years old. He was working as a trainee at the Coal Industry Bank. His older sister, Gu Hongying, is married to Wei Zhiyuan from Jiangdu. Wei works at a coal mining company and also runs a public bond business. They live at No. 5 Fengjili, Miller Road, Hongkou. Wei owns all the houses in that lane, and Gu also lived with Wei's family. However, on July 27th of this year, Gu suddenly disappeared. He was nowhere to be found. Later, Wei discovered that 80,000 yuan in cigarette tax bonds, 100,000 yuan in consolidated tax bonds, and 30,000 yuan in 20-year customs tax bonds, which were kept in an iron box, had all vanished. Knowing that Gu had stolen them, he reported it to the Hongkou Police Station and offered a reward of 2,000 yuan, posting a wanted notice in the newspapers. After stealing the public bonds, Gu fled to Suzhou and stayed at the China Hotel. He cashed in over 1,900 yuan in bond coupons and indulged in prostitution day and night. He contracted a venereal disease and sought treatment at the National Hospital. Recently, a prostitute demanded a large sum of money from Gu, which he refused. The prostitute reported him to the Public Security Bureau, and Gu was arrested. All the stolen goods were found. Wei Zhiyuan was notified and brought 2,000 yuan as the reward, taking Gu back to Shanghai. The day before yesterday afternoon, he handed Gu over to the Hongkou Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Wang Runhe, Gu was detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special First Court, Criminal Division 5. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the situation and prosecuted him for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. Wei Zhiyuan claimed that the defendant had only used up over 800 yuan, which his older sister had admitted to repaying. Furthermore, the defendant's mother was seriously ill, so he did not want to pursue the matter and requested permission to withdraw the lawsuit. The police station's lawyer argued that, according to Article 224 of the Criminal Law, theft among relatives required prosecution to be considered. Since the plaintiff had requested withdrawal, it should be handled according to the law. Judge Huang Risheng then ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>

<p>Ge Xuena, a local girl, is 18 years old, slender, and beautiful. Her parents passed away one after another when she was only four years old. She was raised by her aunt and uncle, Wang Keqin and Wang Ren (No. 91, Wenmiao Road, Ximen), who sent her to school to study and acquire some literacy. In the autumn of the year before last, she was lured away by her uncle's mistress, Wang Chen from Hangzhou (currently residing at No. 3 Tongxuanli, Beile Road, French Concession), and lived in her home. At first, she was made to learn massage. Soon after, Chen forced her into the Tao Ying Hong brothel on Simalu as a prostitute, soliciting customers. This year, Wang Chen forced her to become a dancer at the St. Anna Dance Hall, living a life of dancing embraced by men. The money she earned with great difficulty was used by Chen for her own enjoyment. When she was slightly disobedient, she would be frequently subjected to beatings, abuse, and insults. Unable to endure the suffering any longer, she seized an opportunity to escape on the ninth of last month and returned to her aunt Wang Ren's home, where she tearfully recounted her experiences and sought her protection. Wang Ren, feeling deeply uneasy upon learning the details, acted as her legal guardian and, along with a hired lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing Wang Chen of disrupting the family, enticing a girl under the age of 20, and coercing her into performing duties without obligation, requesting that she be investigated according to the law. The court, upon receiving the lawsuit, arranged for Judge Xiong Huiping and Clerk Tao Zongkan to specially open Criminal Division 5 to hear the case on the morning of the previous day. The plaintiff, Ge Xuena, along with Wang Ren and their lawyer, arrived on time. The defendant, Wang Chen, also arrived with her defense lawyer and filed a counter-suit for false accusation. First, the plaintiff's legal guardian, Wang Ren, stated the reasons for the lawsuit, saying, "The woman is the legal wife of the deceased Wang Keqin, and the defendant is my husband's mistress. After my husband's death, the defendant immediately packed her belongings and fled. Ge Xuena is my own niece. Her parents died when she was four years old, and I raised her. I have photos and neighbors who can testify. Xuena suddenly disappeared when she was sixteen years old, and we searched everywhere without success. Only when she returned this time did we learn that she had been lured away by the defendant. I request an investigation." The defendant, Wang Chen, claimed, "Wang Ren is also Wang Keqin's mistress. Ge lived with her, and because she was not accustomed to the life there, she was sent to me by her older brother, Hongyuan (currently an accountant at the Yunfei Automobile Company in Ximen). The plaintiff's claims are false accusations. Please investigate." The court questioned Ge, who stated, "Ren and Chen are both my aunts. When I was sixteen years old, I went to sweep the tombs, and the defendant called me to her home. I was not sent there by my older brother." Subsequently, the plaintiff presented witnesses, including a neighbor surnamed Li and Wang Ren's daughter, Juzhen (Ge Xuena's cousin), who were summoned to testify. The court noted that it was still necessary to summon a key witness, the girl's older brother, Wan Hongyuan, and adjourned the hearing to 11:00 AM on September 10th.</p>

<h3 id="e135">After Reduced Russian Oil Imports, Japanese Merchants Rise to Compete with the British and Americans <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since the Soviet Union restored diplomatic relations with China, it has signed a contract with the Guanghua Company to transport and sell a large amount of kerosene to China. Due to its low price, it has become increasingly popular, causing great impact to the British and American oil merchants who previously occupied a dominant position, leading to mutual price reductions and competition. This year, the Soviet oil merchants suddenly had a dispute with the Guanghua Company, which has not yet been resolved. At the same time, due to the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, the demand for oil is very high, and the export quantity is gradually decreasing. Therefore, its market share in China is not as good as before. On the other hand, due to the abundant oil production in the three eastern provinces after the September 18th Incident, Japanese kerosene has been transported and sold to China in large quantities in the past two years. According to customs statistics, in the past seven months of this year, 9.43 million boxes have been imported, which is more than three times the 2.79 million boxes imported in the whole of last year. Therefore, it is an undeniable fact that Japanese oil merchants have replaced the original position of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The factory and warehouse of the British American Tobacco Factory in Pudong are vast, and it has employed 50 to 60 petition police officers to protect the factory.

<h3 id="e137">Continued Hearing of the "Cihang Weekly" Case <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Jiefei, Abbot of Lingyin Temple, Benlian, Abbot of Zhaoqing Temple, and Yueqing, Abbot of Fajing Temple, all standing committee members of the Hangzhou Buddhist Association, previously filed a lawsuit against Zhong Lijian (courtesy name Kanghou, from Shaoxing), publisher of the Cihang Weekly, Liu Peixi, manager, and a Mr. You, editor, in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, accusing them of libel and damaging the reputation of the entire Buddhist community in Hangzhou by publishing news about the replacement of the abbot of Lian'an Temple in Hangzhou in the June 17th issue of the newspaper, which is based on the third floor of Jueling Vegetarian Restaurant at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Songshan Road in this city. The lawsuit was filed in the name of the legal representative of the Hangzhou Buddhist Association, jointly represented by lawyer Gu Kenfu, requesting that they be investigated and punished according to the law, and seeking a civil claim for the publication of the judgment in major newspapers in Shanghai and Hangzhou and compensation for reputational damage of 10,000 yuan, etc. After three hearings, as reported in this newspaper, Judge Chen Pusheng of the Special Second Court held a continued hearing yesterday morning. The plaintiffs, except for Yuetao, were present, while Quefei and Benlian were present with their lawyers. The defendant, Mr. You, was still absent. When questioned, Zhong Lijian stated that the text published in the Cihang Weekly was not a personal matter for the Hangzhou Buddhist Association, and that the theft of temple property by the descendants of the sage was also a fact, not a fabrication. Subsequently, the plaintiff's lawyer, Gu Kenfu, stated that the defendants' previous testimony in court involved a fourth concubine. At that time, a Gu Yiyu, falsely claiming to be a journalist, visited Quefei at Luwen Temple four times, thinking of extorting money. After Quefei refused, Zhong Lijian, the first defendant in this case, mediated, but was also rejected by Quefei. Hangzhou newspapers published this news. Quefei, being falsely accused, also published a statement in the newspaper to clarify. Later, Chen Xiaopu, president of the Weifeng News Agency, discovered that Gu Yiyu had impersonated a reporter of the agency to extort money outside, and sued him in the local court, resulting in a sentence of three months' imprisonment, which can be verified. As for the theft of temple property by the descendants of the sage, it was also fabricated by Zhong. Because Zhong was working in the Buddhist Association, he was subsequently dismissed by the association. However, the Buddhist Association had 1,000 yuan in Zhong's possession, which he refused to return when asked, and he sued the association in court, and lost. This case is still in administrative appeal and has not yet ended. As for Huizong being fined for smoking, Huizong actually has no such habit. Because all the temples in Hangzhou rely on the spring and autumn incense festivals, and some pilgrims may carry prohibited items such as tobacco and drugs to the mountains, the monks in the temples should not interfere. On one occasion, Zhong secretly reported it to the security department, and the pilgrims carrying drugs fled upon hearing the news, causing Huizong to be wrongly fined 300 yuan. In short, the text published in the Cihang Weekly completely had the act of defaming the plaintiffs and should be investigated. After the court verified the statements, it questioned both parties. Later, because the third defendant was not present, the hearing was adjourned to the 16th for further questioning.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I recently read a news item in your newspaper's local news column, which stated that our company's Hua Wu steamer ran aground in Japan. It said that the manager of the Nanhua Company was Zhao Fuchen, which is not true. The general manager of our company is Mr. Liu Shisun. Mr. Liu is in Beiping due to business and has not returned. Therefore, Mr. Zhao Fuchen came to take care of matters as a creditor and friend. He is not the manager of our company. We are deeply afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world, so we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Shanghai Nanhua Steamer Co., Ltd., August 31st.</p>

<h3 id="e156">This City's Volleyball Players Held a Charity Game Yesterday; The Strength of Both Sides Was Balanced, Making It Difficult to Distinguish a Clear Winner <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The men's and women's volleyball charity game for disaster relief, organized by the Sichuan Road YMCA, was held in the organization's gymnasium at 8 PM last night. The players on both sides were the most outstanding members selected from the city's volleyball players to participate in the Sixth National Games. The intensive volleyball training was scheduled to end yesterday. The YMCA took this opportunity, with the consent of the city's selection committee, to hold this game. One side was playing for the sake of the disaster victims, and the other side was using this game as a basis for selecting official representatives in the future. Therefore, both male and female players put forth their best efforts to perform last night, and the skills of both sides were at a high level, with the scores being very close. By 7 PM, philanthropists and volleyball fans had begun to arrive in succession, and the half-dollar seats were already full. However, there were very few one-dollar seats. The duties of maintaining order and collecting tickets were undertaken by over twenty members of the YMCA's middle school Boy Scout troop, led by instructor Mr. Lu Chenglong, and the order was well maintained. However, one of the YMCA staff members, named Wang Jien, was impetuous and had some disagreements with the audience, almost causing a disturbance. The audience was dissatisfied, which was regrettable. Last night's game was related to the selection of the city's official representatives, so the training director Chen Bingde, selection committee member Li Feiyun, and coach Cao Tingzan all came to observe. According to Mr. Chen Bingde's statement to reporters, two more training sessions will be held at the Baxianqiao YMCA next Thursday and Saturday, after which the official representatives will be determined.</p>

<p>During the break between matches between Min and Jiangnan, some players from both sides were trying to kick the ball on the court. Yang Desheng crossed the bamboo fence and joined the practice. He suddenly tripped Jiangnan player Lu Wenyuan's leg with his foot. Lu, in pain, retaliated by tripping him as well. In this back-and-forth, neither was willing to yield. Yang Desheng even punched Lu, and Lu retaliated. The relatives of both sides who were nearby also joined in the brawl. The ball game then began, and the storm subsided. It was found that Yang Desheng was formerly a member of the Sanmin team, but his actions were met with disapproval by his teammates, so he was dismissed by the team and transferred to the China team. He registered to participate in the competition this time, but after review by the committee, he was disqualified due to his poor character. Unexpectedly, Yang did not know how to repent and still had such behavior discovered. Lu Wenyuan's general knowledge of him is regrettable. It is heard that the association will convene a committee to discuss the punishment method for this case.</p>

This semester, in order to encourage outstanding students and provide relief to poor students, scholarships and free studentships have been established, with the same number as last semester. A total of 30 students from all grades who have excellent character and academics this semester will receive scholarships, including Qian Youlun and others.

<p>Ned then left. When he returned, he had two dollars in his pocket. He took it out to show the other children, feeling very satisfied. At the same time, he told them how happy he was that afternoon, how well these young people treated him, how they praised his dancing, and that he was allowed to come back and find him in the future.</p>
<p>"This is so much better than playing music on the street, because I couldn't get a penny then. Now it all belongs to me, and it's all about eating, laughing, and having fun. I'm in business now, just like Tommy and the peddler. I really like it," Ned said, patting his old money bag, triumphantly feeling like a millionaire.</p>
<p>His business was booming because there were many suburban gatherings after the summer, so the need for Ned's skills also increased sharply. He can apply and go, but he must not hinder his schoolwork, and the suburban gathering people must be good young people. Because Mr. Pei explained to him that a preliminary and excellent academic foundation is a must for everyone, as for money, no matter how much, it cannot be used to enter the dangerous trap of indulgence and extravagance. Ned also agreed with this view. Sometimes beautiful cars stopped in front of the Great Dipper to pick him up. This group of pure children left with their heads held high, or played the piano triumphantly and returned, although tired, but very happy. A bag was filled with the money he earned from his skills, and he also brought back "good things" from the banquet for his never-forgotten Little Plum and Little Tandy.</p>

<p>Foreign Banks Remain Calm, Sellers Active: Bid Price Plummets, Market Fluctuates Greatly in Half a Day, Ending with a Fall of 6.7 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw foreign banks inactive, prices weakened upon opening, sellers seized the opportunity to become active, leading to a severe drop at one point. Sassoon and other banks worked hard to prop up foreign exchange rates, giving rise to a rebound. Unexpectedly, sellers from Hong Kong and Qiao Zhibu appeared, dampening sentiment, and prices eventually fell back. This was also a reaction to four consecutive days of gains. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both Britain and America were stable. Forward silver prices in Montreux rose by 1.5% and fell by 3%, respectively, while exchange rates declined. Spot gold prices in London remained unchanged, causing some reaction in sentiment. Off-market pre-market trading opened lower at 92.3 yuan, with major players such as Dadecheng Fuxingyong selling, pushing prices into the 90 yuan range. After the official opening, the Central Bank's posted exchange rates were revealed, with both Britain and America remaining unchanged, and the customs gold unit also unchanged. The standard bid price remained at 913.5 yuan, still stable. Major sellers were excited, leading to an oversupply in the market and a sharp drop at one point. Sassoon worked hard to prop up the shilling, and banks also took in U.S. dollars, which led to buyers becoming active and pushing prices up.

Later, banks repeatedly worked to stabilize the situation, and the foreign exchange market shifted from loose to tight.

<h3 id="e174">Large Comparison of Period Silver Dollar Settlement Increases: Guangdong Silver Dollar Continues to Decline <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>At this time of idleness in various industries and poor financial adjustment, there is nothing important to record for the various market conditions in Shanghai. However, yesterday was also the time for the large comparison of period silver dollars at the end of the month, so the various settlements increased in frequency. The banks were particularly busy beyond the norm. The interbank lending rate in the market was still not very high or low. The morning and afternoon markets were both 1 jiao 5 fen. There has been little rise or fall in recent days. The "hua tou" was still not watered down, and all were "bai hua". Interbank lending transactions were inherently in demand at this time, but because the market was sluggish, the demand was naturally not too high. It is estimated that the morning session transferred over 4.2 million, with new transactions of over 400,000. The afternoon session had over 600,000 transactions. The Small General Assembly had over 500,000 transactions. Due to the end of the month, the number of banknotes entering and leaving also increased. It is estimated that over 900,000 were recovered, while the amount issued, including both circulating notes and marked notes, was no less than 1.2 to 1.3 million. Because there are very few new transactions currently being made for silver dollar mortgages, the amount of redemptions is limited each day. However, yesterday was the end of the month and settlements were required, so it seemed slightly more than the previous few days. It is estimated that there were over 1.3 million, with only over 400,000 new transactions made. The money shops' silver dollar public order settlement was over 56.6 million, the "hua tou" amount settlement was over 8.4 million, various remittances totaled over 900,000, and cash collection was 300,000 to 400,000. Bank settlements are cumbersome at the end of the month, and it is not possible to interview as easily as usual within a short period of time. Moreover, the settlement time is extended, and it is necessary to sort things out by 7 or 8 p.m., so there are no accurate figures at the time of writing. I will record it as it is. As for the Chinese and foreign banks, it is estimated that the total amount entering and leaving is approximately over 8 million for foreign banks, over 10 million for Chinese banks, and 7 to 8 million for Japanese banks. In addition, there is a month-end settlement, with a total of over 10 million for all three types of banks. Also, the Jiangnan small silver dollar remained unchanged in the morning and afternoon markets, and there was no difference from the previous day. The morning and afternoon markets were the same price, at 835 yuan. The number of transactions made was only 3,000 jiao in the morning market, and there were no transactions in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small silver dollar declined, due to more selling than buying. As a result, the price fell below the 40-yuan mark. The morning market was 739 yuan 8 jiao, and the afternoon market fell another 8 jiao, to 739 yuan. The number of transactions made was 150,000 jiao in the morning market and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose slightly by 500 wen, to 345,500 wen. The transaction consideration was 11,000 yuan in silver dollars, equivalent to 38,005 strings of wen in copper coins. Also, the total number of check clearings was 44,490,0232 yuan and 4 jiao 4 fen in silver dollars. The total number of clearings was 25,597,5486 yuan and 8 jiao 4 fen in silver dollars, the remittance clearing was 11,103,6018 yuan and 7 jiao 3 fen in silver dollars, the total amount collected by the money shops was 3,249,469 yuan and 0 jiao 3 fen, and other funds were 4,641,057 yuan and 8 jiao 4 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday at the Shanghai Commercial Securities Exchange, market conditions were quite volatile, and market prices fluctuated erratically. Market sentiment was uncertain. Environmental news indicated that the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia seemed to be on the verge of war, but this would not affect China for the time being. Major players had stopped selling around the 23rd barrier, and market sentiment had stabilized slightly. There were many short positions in the market, and many people were covering small amounts. Therefore, the prospects for market prices were mutually constrained, and there might be a period of stability. If there are no special changes in the environment, the bond market will not have major changes. Yesterday's events: At the opening in the morning, sentiment followed the previous day's decline, and became increasingly soft. The numbers 46 and 48 continued to be sold, and the previous decline had not stopped. The distant futures for troop reduction fell sharply by 6 jiao, and the rest also fell by 2 or 3 jiao. Later, the numbers 16 and 26 and others were bought quite a bit. Starting from the salt tax distant futures, the atmosphere suddenly turned around, and gradually rose. The 23rd customs barrier rose by 4 jiao, and the rest also rose by 2 or 3 jiao. In the next session, the previous prices followed the trend and rose by 5 fen, 1 jiao, or 3 jiao. However, after the 22nd customs barrier, prices eased again by 1 or 2 jiao. Prices rose and fell erratically, and the trend was uncertain. Sentiment turned chaotic. At the opening in the afternoon, trading was extremely slow, with both rises and falls of only 5 fen or 1 jiao. However, the Zhengliu distant futures suddenly rose by 2 jiao. The closing was slightly firmer, with prices slightly better by 5 fen, 1 jiao, or 2 jiao. However, since 96 broke through the 10-yuan mark the day before, it continued to decline. As a result of market prices, the previous prices were down slightly by 1 jiao 5 fen or 3 jiao. The numbers 4 and 16 in the later prices, starting from the distant futures unified tax, were in greater demand, and all saw an increase, from 5 fen, 1 jiao, to half a yuan. The total number of transactions was 13,746,000 yuan. The result of the rises and falls is compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (30th) the New York stock market was dull and uneven. Since next Monday is Labor Day, the exchange will be closed as usual. Public utility stocks and entertainment stocks rose. Oil stocks eased because the plan to restrict production in California failed. The bond market saw both rises and falls. Stocks on the small exchange rose. The total number of shares traded for the day was 830,000 shares.</p>

<p>The yarn market weakened due to mixed news on American cotton. Third-grade yarn fell by more than three yuan. Japanese merchants slightly sold yarn in the market, causing market prices to fall by about a yuan. It is the end of the month, and the long and short sides did not have much action. Market prices seemed to be temporarily consolidating. Fortunately, current yarn sales were still smooth, which boosted confidence in general.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Yarn Falls by About a Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the pre-market for banned yarn, the third-grade report fell and Japanese merchants sold, due to mixed American cotton news and weaker sentiment. Prices of all months fell in unison, with prices falling by more than one yuan. The second session was flat. After the third session, the market atmosphere improved slightly and prices rebounded by three or five jiao, as current yarn sales continued to be strong. The result was a drop of seven to nine jiao compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon, market prices were still unable to break out of the weak situation due to a lack of favorable news, and continued to fall by three to six jiao. Sellers included Changfeng with 1,700 bales, Runkang with 550 bales, Yukang with 600 bales, Dafu with 1,600 bales, Renfeng with 900 bales, Dachang with 300 bales, Hexing with 300 bales, Taixing with 300 bales, and Senkang with 1,000 bales.

<p>Sichuan and Guangdong Spot Sales Continue to be Smooth</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales continued to be active. Sichuan and Guangdong inland areas had good demand. The total number of transactions for the day was 882 bales. Market prices fell by five jiao to one yuan. The amounts purchased by each gang are as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market weakened and entered a sluggish path due to the weakness of foreign cotton. The long-term pull-up of old cotton by the bulls had come to an end. The autumn heat was beneficial to the cotton harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which eased the sentiment. However, it was not easy for the bulls to sell the Jincheng cotton bought in at 36 yuan in the short term. General observations indicated that the flat and sluggish situation of the cotton market would not be easy to change in the short term.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cotton Continues to Decline by Two Jiao</p>
<p>The cotton market was sluggish due to the softening of American and Indian cotton prices. At the opening, prices fell by about two jiao. Prices rose slightly in the second session. In the third closing session, prices stabilized slightly because yarn sales were still continuing to be strong. As a result, prices fell by 1 jiao 5 fen for the near term and rose or fell by 5 fen for the distant term compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the selling atmosphere was slightly stronger and prices continued to fall by one or two jiao as the yarn market continued to be weak. Trading in the market was slow and news was quiet. Sellers included Yukang with 1,000 dan, Yuda with 800 dan, Mingde with 1,100 dan, Zhenda with 600 dan, Tongxing with 2,800, Guda with 700 dan, Yuanyi with 600 dan, Changfeng with 2,300 dan, Runkang with 500 dan, Dachang with 600 dan, Yongchang with 800 dan, Xinchengchang with 1,300 dan, Changhe with 1,700 dan, Jifeng with 1,300 dan, Yikang with 4,100 dan, and Xinheng with 1,300.

<p>Spot Sales Still Haven't Improved</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales still haven't improved. Because the new cotton harvest is gradually flooding the market, manufacturers are taking a passive attitude.</p>

<p>At the opening of the American cotton market yesterday, prices of all months rose or fell by one to two pounds sterling. Trading was slow and industry insiders hoped that there would be an increase in hedging sales, but there were not many sellers. Prices weakened in the early morning due to a large number of bulls closing out their positions and the Continental Gang selling, but then rebounded due to Liverpool and industry insiders buying. It was rumored that the cotton hoarding group sold October and bought far-month contracts. Farmers did not yet understand the loan plan and needed detailed explanations. The spot market situation was calm and firm. Cotton fabrics were even more active. The sales volume for this week was estimated to be double the production volume. Hess estimated that the factory usage for this week would be 177,000 bales. The Liverpool inventory was 147,000 bales. The closing was firm. Spot prices fell by five pounds sterling, while futures prices rose by four to eight pounds sterling for all months except October, which fell by four pounds sterling. English spot cotton fell by nine points, and futures prices rose or fell by one point. Indian cotton was initially firm due to European exporters covering their short positions for hedging, but then weakened due to large sales by buyers and operators. The Pingguoer fell by half a Lachie, the Aomula fell by 1.25 Lachies, and the Bairoxi fell by 1.5 Lachies. The original telegram record is on the left (30th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for 31st Bairoxi cotton was 191.5 Lachies, down half a Lachie from the previous day's close. The weekend statistics for American cotton are listed below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, a total of 17 or 18 shipments arrived at various locations in Shanghai South. (A total of more than 3,000 shi of goods.) The weather turned cloudy and rainy, and sentiment became higher. However, sales were still not smooth. Apart from some movement in the local streets, not a single rice bag was sold. Therefore, although sellers had high hopes, they lacked sufficient appeal. As a result, the prices of various thick-grained japonica and thin-grained indica rice were able to rise by a few jiao. With this rainy weather, various new japonica rice also looked promising. However, because there were more shipments of new Yangchuan jian rice, prices were only slightly tighter. However, tuanjian rice also increased by 1 jiao. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were few shipments from various locations in Hexia, about 10 shipments. The market's inventory was depleted. Because the weather was cold and sometimes cloudy and sometimes sunny, various shops bought, and prices increased by 1 or 2 jiao. The prices of thin-grained high-quality materials were firm and close to the previous level. The price of baiyuan rice increased by about 1 jiao. The arrival of new Dongxin japonica rice was small and sales were good, and prices increased by 1 jiao. The new Kejian rice was sold actively, and market prices increased by 1 jiao. Kunshan new Yangjian rice sales were average, and prices opened at 8 yuan 8 jiao. Other goods also saw a tightening trend.</p>
<p>The foreign rice situation turned active yesterday because of the scarcity of foreign indica arrivals, while domestic and Tianjin purchases remained active. The total market had less than 1,000 bags of new foreign indica arrivals, all purchased by domestic and Tianjin merchants. There were 95 bags of Jiangxi early rice, 428 bags of Ningbo Wenzhou machine early rice, and 110 bags of Nanjing machine rough rice. Prices were 4 or 5 fen to 1 jiao higher than the previous market. With low foreign rice inventories, the market was originally optimistic. However, with the continued arrival of foreign indica rice, it was difficult for market prices to rise further. After foreign indica rice was in demand yesterday, foreign rice also showed signs of being in demand. A total of 2,100 bags of Saigon rice, 450 bags of Xiaojiao rice, and 634 bags of Siamese rice were sold throughout the day. Apart from some transactions with Tianjin and inland areas, all were purchased by domestic merchants.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the delivery date for August period flour. The quantity was only 15,000 bags, delivered by Xinda Factory. However, for the sake of convenience for both parties, both volumes were rolled over. It was said to reach about 100,000 bags. The remaining factories either took back the goods themselves, or were collected by the customer gang. Around the end of the month, the number of goods transported and loaded by various customer gangs reached 200,000 to 400,000 bags. However, after the standard ended, there was a reversal and prices fell, which industry insiders believed was a special situation. As for the receiving party, the local streets took 10,000 bags, and the Tianjin gang took 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>The addition of Yangtze River flour to the standard has been approved by the shareholders' meeting. A total of ten companies will be added, starting from January next year. The difference in price will be divided into three levels: 3 fen, 4 fen, and 5 fen.</p>

<p>Since Guangdong Province has increased additional taxes, the soybean cake market has seen a downward trend. The Chaozhou and Shantou merchants have stopped transporting the goods, making the market very quiet. Only a few inland merchants are inquiring. Factories are just selling off remaining cakes. Yesterday, the spot price for soybean cake fell another three cents, with 600 pieces of Four-Brand cakes being sold. The future trend is that if Guangdong Province does not abolish the tax rate, there is no hope for a turnaround in the market. The new bean market is still worse than before. Second-grade soybeans with heavy insect damage have fallen more sharply, with prices opening at $2.96. High-quality Jiangbei beans are still firm, and the market is relatively stable. $9 beans are not selling.</p>

<p>Recently, due to sluggish sales, the market price of tree fungus in both producing areas and Shanghai has slightly relaxed.

<p>The sales of woolen fabrics have been gradually picking up in this district, both to local merchants and customers. Businesses such as tailoring shops, Western clothing stores, hat and shoe stores, overcoat makers, and new clothing workshops are making considerable purchases of Han Ling Peng medium-thick broadcloth, thin tweed, headwear cloth, cavalry twill, and herringbone fabric. In particular, Japanese thin tweed priced from $1.78 to $2.45 and Yuan Chang broadcloth priced at $2.35 are selling well. Domestic Da Long woolen fabric is also selling well. Because their inventory has been waiting for funds urgently, financiers have been buying them up. Now, they are being sold at a low price, with broadcloth mostly selling for only $2.23 per yard and Hwate cloth for $3, on par with the market price of Japanese goods, which makes them popular among buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Scientific Disaster Prevention <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>This year, the floods were severe, with rivers rising together. Although the Yangtze River water level is now receding, the Yellow River continues to break its banks everywhere. How unfortunate! Children, seeing the current severe disasters, have you ever felt the need to prevent disasters in the future? If you have such a good ambition, you must have a scientific foundation as early as possible, so that you can apply science to conquer nature in the future.</p>
<p>Dutch water conservancy projects are considered the best in the world. The Netherlands has very low terrain, with many places below sea level, making it easier to be flooded than the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins in our country. They rely entirely on scientific methods to build dikes and fight the sea. Sometimes they even drain seawater and turn beaches into land, never suffering from floods. Why is our country turning in the opposite direction?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The Yellow River brings a hundred harms," and it has been a problem since ancient times. Although various dynasties have never lacked efforts to control the river, they lacked a scientific perspective at the time. Therefore, after some time, it would break its banks again. As for the Yangtze River, it was originally beneficial and harmless. However, it has been severely flooded in recent years. Some say, "Because Hongze Lake is silted up and cannot hold water to buffer," others say, "There are too many sandy fields along the river, so the dikes are easily breached," and still others say, "The ships traveling in the river pour out burned coal, which over the years has filled the bottom of the river, so the water势泛涨……"</p>
<p>These causes of disasters all have their reasons. To prevent disasters, we must learn from the Netherlands, have a fighting spirit, and use scientific methods to organize on a large scale in order to achieve lasting peace, otherwise the future troubles will be endless and unimaginable.</p>
<p>However, water conservancy projects require a clear understanding of geography and a thorough knowledge of mathematics. Children, if you aspire to water conservancy and disaster prevention, you must pay attention to studying these two subjects to have a foundation.</p>

<p>— SeQiu</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the Manchus entered the customs and ruled for hundreds of years, oppressing the people too severely. Therefore, during the Daoguang and Xianfeng periods, a great revolution was sparked, and the leader of this revolution was Hong Xiuquan.</p>
<p>He was born in 1813 AD, which was the seventh month of the 18th year of the Jiaqing reign of the Qing Dynasty. He was from Huaxian County, Guangdong. His father was named Guo You, and he was a very virtuous man. His mother passed away early. His family had been the clan leader of the Hong clan for generations.</p>
<p>Many of his ancestors were high-ranking officials in the Ming Dynasty. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, everyone vowed not to surrender to the Manchus, and together with many Ming Dynasty loyalists, they moved from Jia Guangzhou in the northern border of Guangdong to Huaxian County. Therefore, his anti-Manchu ideology was inherited from his ancestors.</p>
<p>He began reading at the age of seven, and because he was intelligent, he made rapid progress. He was particularly interested in history, but his family was very poor, and buying books was not easy. His teacher loved his intelligence and often waived his tuition and sometimes gave him some books on history. However, at the age of sixteen, he had to drop out of school because his family was even poorer and he needed to make a living.</p>
<p>After leaving the village school, Xiuquan made a living by teaching in the village. At that time, it was the era of the imperial examination, and the only shortcut for scholars to become officials was to learn the eight-legged essay and take the exam. Because he was bored with poverty, he also wanted to try it, but he failed the exam twice. He was greatly angered, simply stopped taking the exam, and specialized in studying the Christian Bible. Later, he officially joined Christianity and was soon elected as the leader.</p>
<p>At this time, his opposition to the Manchus became even stronger. On the one hand, he preached, but on the other hand, he used this to promote revolution. Therefore, he won over many heroes such as Yang Xiuqing and Shi Dakai. Later, seeing that the time was ripe, he raised the flag and in less than three years, his power reached Nanjing. Almost half of the Qing Dynasty's territory was under his jurisdiction. The country he established was called the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. But the result was still a failure.</p>
<p>Children! We must know that no matter what we do, it can only be done if we are united internally. Hong Xiuquan and others started their uprising in Guangxi, and they were unstoppable because of their internal unity. But later, when they arrived in Nanjing, the spirit of internal unity gradually dissipated. Everyone only knew how to compete for power and kill each other, shifting their external focus to internal matters. Therefore, they were eventually eliminated by the Manchus, which is a pity.</p>

<p>— Chuyu</p>
<p>(1) Liquid foods stay in the stomach for the shortest time, such as water, tea, sauce, oil, soup, beer, soda, etc., which can be digested and excreted in about an hour. Wine and milk take two hours. (But foreign wine is an exception.) Rice enters the stomach and turns into porridge after more than two hours, but with the help of digestive medicine, that time can be reduced by half. Radishes, eggplants, melon seeds, and small beans stay in the stomach for about four hours. Bamboo shoots and stir-fried beans take more than four hours. Greasy things, like fried vegetables, digest more slowly. Among meats, bird meat is the slowest, followed by beef, and then pork. Fish digests faster than pork, and sea fish digests faster than river fish. In general healthy people, food is completely digested by the stomach after five hours. Patients with weak digestive power have longer digestion times than healthy people. Generally speaking, for foods with protein as the main ingredient, a separate investigation of the digestion time in the stomach for 100 grams shows that a half-cooked egg takes 1 hour and 30 minutes, a raw egg takes 2 hours and 30 minutes, beef takes 2 hours and 45 minutes, fried meat takes 4 hours, fried meat takes 4 hours and 15 minutes, pork takes 4 hours and 10 minutes, beast meat takes 4 hours and 30 minutes, bird meat is the slowest, and a bowl of beans takes 210 minutes to digest.</p>
<p>(2) Food intake. The body generates heat after we eat every day, and this heat is necessary to maintain life. But how much should a person eat in a day? According to nutritionists' investigations: eating 403 grams of brown rice can get 52.8% of the heat, 114 grams of miscellaneous grains can get 14.8% of the heat, 81 grams of beans can transmit 10.9% of the heat, 836 grams of vegetables can get 12.1% of the heat, 46 grams of fruits can get 1.0% of the heat, 72 grams of fish and shellfish can get 2.9% of the heat, 4 grams of beast meat can get 0.3% of the heat, 1 gram of bird meat can get 0.1% of the heat, 5 grams of bird eggs can get 0.3% of the heat, 6 grams of milk can get 0.2% of the heat, and 28 grams of sugar can get 4.0% of the heat, totaling 2675 calories.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Science Teacher's Magic Trick (Moving Boats) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>It's Sunday again, and many children are sitting and waiting for the science teacher to perform magic tricks. But the science teacher and his assistant didn't come on stage. Instead, they walked over from the front row of seats. The assistant was holding a basin of water, with four small boats made of cork floating in it. He placed the basin on a stool, and the children gathered around to watch.</p>
<p>"Interesting! Interesting!" The children cheered. It turned out that the four small boats were floating on the water and moving around automatically.</p>
<p>"Do you think these small boats are fun? Then go back and make your own. The materials are very simple, just two or three pieces of cork, two or three old phonograph needles—the needles for playing records—and a magnet—horseshoe-shaped or rod-shaped will do.</p>
<p>"How do you make them? First, cut the cork into flat, round pieces, about two or three pieces. Then, place one end of the needle on the magnet and rub it in one direction. After rubbing for a while, turn it to the other direction and rub it. You know, the needles are made of iron. After rubbing iron on a magnet, it becomes a magnet itself and can attract other iron. After the needles are magnetized, insert them into the center of the cork so that they float on the water, and you will have two or three small boats.</p>
<p>"These two or three small boats are all attached with magnetic needles. Because the magnetic needles can attract and repel each other, the small boats move around in a very interesting way.</p>
<p>"Children must be asking: Why can magnetic needles attract and repel each other? Originally, all magnets have north and south poles. The pole that always points south is called the south pole, and the pole that always points north is called the north pole. If you move the south pole of one needle close to the south pole of another needle, they will repel each other; if you move it towards the north pole of another needle, they will attract each other. This is called 'like poles repel, unlike poles attract.' Because these small corks have needles with attractive and repulsive forces, they all move around.</p>
<p>"This is a very interesting toy, and I hope you try it yourselves."</p>

<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>You must know that the woodpecker was originally not a bird, but a meddlesome old woman with a very long nose. She would stick her long nose into people's heads and pots, sniffing and eavesdropping. She wanted to know if everything belonged to her. She was meddlesome, loved to gossip, and often played tricks on her neighbors. The gods, seeing her behavior, took a large bag and filled it with ants, mosquitoes, beetles, and various insects. They tied the bag tightly and then gave it to the old woman, saying, "Take this bag back, but be careful not to open it. If your curiosity leads you to stick your nose into this bag, you will suffer endless harm."</p>
<p>The old woman replied, "I will never do such a thing. I will never disobey the will of the gods. I will be careful."</p>
<p>She carried the bag on her back and started walking home. But as soon as she carried the bag, her fingers started twitching. After walking a short distance, she could no longer resist. She sat down on the grass and untied the bag to look. This was exactly what the insects in the bag wanted. As soon as she untied the bag, they crawled out, scattered on the ground, and ran their own ways, running as fast as they could. Some hid underground, some escaped under the grass, and some climbed up the trees, all running as fast as they could.</p>
<p>When the old woman saw this, she was shocked. She wanted to gather the insects back and put them back in the bag. But the insects didn't wait for her. They knew how to escape, and most of them had already escaped. A few were caught by her and put back in the bag, and she tied the bag tightly. At that moment, she heard the voice of the gods. They asked her what she had done, whether she had disobeyed the gods' command.</p>
<p>"Where have the ants, mosquitoes, beetles, and various insects that I gave you gone? From now on, you will become a bird and gather these insects back until all the insects I gave you are collected. Then you will become a human again."</p>
<p>So the old woman became a woodpecker. Her long nose became a long beak. She searches everywhere for these ants, mosquitoes, beetles, and various insects, hoping to put them all back in the bag and turn herself back into a human. But until now, her work has not been completed, so she is still a woodpecker.</p>

<p>The children in the water I am talking about now are not those happy children playing in the ponds, but those poor children who are drowned in the floods.</p>
<p>This year, floods have occurred in various places. There are records in the newspapers and photos in the magazines. You children must have seen them. Then please think carefully: the water is so high! The water is so rapid! Adults can still find ways to escape, but children can't run or climb high, so many children are drowned by the floods while crying and shouting! Fortunately, some who have not been drowned by the floods are also starving, living in uncertainty. You think, how tragic is this?</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy in Holland who used one hand to cover the leaking dike opening and froze all night in the cold wind, but he finally saved the lives of the villagers. Chinese children lack courage, and the rivers are turbulent and rapid, which cannot be controlled by a few people in a short period of time. Therefore, I hope that all children in the country will have deep sympathy for those children who are drowned in the water. Those with financial resources should provide relief, and those with ambition should study water conservancy and create specialized water management talents, so that our country will never suffer from floods again. Wouldn't that be great?</p>

<p>— Elementary School Student Yan Zhongjin</p>
<p>Recently, many machines have been invented in the world. Their function is nothing more than to save human time and effort and to gain economic efficiency of time. The bicycle is one example. Its structure is that the front and rear wheels are single. The front wheel has a clip handle that can be used to correct the direction. The rear wheel has a steel chain next to the bottom, which is connected to the crankshaft in the middle of the two wheels. Therefore, when the foot steps on it, the chain pulls the rear wheel, drives the front wheel, and then it can move forward.</p>
<p>Ordinary people can only walk ten miles in two hours. If you use a bicycle instead, you can walk ten miles in one hour. Isn't this saving labor and time? However, you must also have considerable skills when riding a bicycle. I remember when I first learned, it took a lot of effort, and I had to practice every day before I could gradually become proficient. Now I can ride very freely, and the turning is also very flexible. It can be seen that no matter what you do, you must practice!</p>

<p>— XinQing</p>
<p>As soon as they heard this, the sergeants and soldiers, whether wounded or not, all rushed to the window and rallied to resist again. Before long, they saw the enemies gradually retreating and becoming agitated. The senior adjutant suddenly gathered a few soldiers, fixed bayonets on the tips of their guns, and went downstairs to resist the enemies attacking outside the gate. Then he returned upstairs. Before he had run up the stairs, he suddenly heard a commotion of footsteps and loud cheers outside. Then many Italian cavalry helmets appeared in the smoke, and shiny swords waved in the air, rushing towards the enemies, slashing at the heads and shoulders of the enemies. Then the senior adjutant led his soldiers out of the door. The enemies' lines immediately wavered and finally retreated. The enemies had retreated, and the village was saved. Soon, two battalions of Italian infantry and two cannons occupied the nearby highlands.</p>
<p>The senior adjutant was wounded in one hand by a bullet in the final charge. But the victory of this day belonged to the Italians. The next day, the Italian and Austrian sides continued to fight. Although the Italian soldiers resisted bravely, they were finally defeated because they were outnumbered. On the morning of the 26th, the entire army retreated to the Mincio River.</p>
<p>Although the senior adjutant was wounded, he still led his team of soldiers to the Mincio River. At sunset, they arrived in the town of Guodo, very tired. He immediately went to find his lieutenant, who had lost an arm in the battle and had been transported here by a Red Cross ambulance. Someone told the senior adjutant that the church had been converted into a temporary hospital, and the lieutenant might be there. The senior adjutant rushed there and saw that the church was filled with wounded soldiers, all lying on two rows of canvas beds. The floor was even covered with mattresses. Two surgeons and several orderlies were busy moving around, and all around he heard a large chorus of cries and groans.</p>
<p>The senior adjutant entered the door and stopped, looking around, carefully searching for his lieutenant. At this time, he suddenly heard a weak voice calling near him, "Adjutant!"</p>
<p>He turned his head and saw that it was the little drummer. He was lying on a small wooden bed, wrapped in a red and white gauze, wrapped straight to his neck. His arms were stretched out, his face was thin and white, but his eyes were still burning like two lumps of charcoal.</p>
<p>The senior adjutant said in surprise and joy, "So! Is that you? Good! You have fulfilled your responsibility."</p>
<p>The little drummer replied, "I only did my best."</p>
<p>"Are you injured?" the senior adjutant asked, looking around at the beds, still searching for his lieutenant.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Sending Off Ms. Chen Shu <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Going Abroad to Investigate Women's Education!</p>
<p>Reports indicate that Ms. Chen Shu, the former principal of Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Women's Middle School, recently resigned firmly after a disturbance in the school's normal school department a month ago. The Jiangsu Education Department has now sent her abroad to conduct on-site investigations into women's education. She is scheduled to depart soon. Ms. Chen is the niece of Mr. Wu Zhihui, a senior member of the Central Supervisory Committee, and firmly holds a prominent position among the limited number of famous women in the country. Her resume, even from the simple record in the newspaper, reads:</p>
<p>"A senior student who studied in England, professor at Beiping Women's Higher Normal School for six years, affiliated middle school of the Women's Higher Normal School for ten years, Mongolian-Tibetan Specialized School for three years, and Suzhou Women's Normal School for eight years."</p>
<p>If written in detail, it could likely form a very long list. Such a well-established woman who has been involved in girls' education for many years, such a distinguished woman being sent abroad to investigate women's education, is a great honor for us women!</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic women's education has reached a dying state of being scraped and skinned. Externally, the decline in the economy and the influence of the revival of traditional values, leading to the contempt of women, have resulted in a dwindling number of female students. Internally, the educators themselves are muddled and lack vision, rendering women's education equivalent to nothing, which is truly heartbreaking! Currently, most educators treat female students in the same way as male students, simply having them "recite scriptures in front of the blackboard." It is unknown whether male students, though not influenced by "personality" cultivation in school, can hope for grand aspirations after graduation, but at least due to social customs, they generally still know how to engage in making a living and being independent. As for female students, if they are not given any "inspiration of independent personality," then after graduation, they will remain dependent on others as before. Consequently, they will either become corrupted, chasing after playboy merchants as fashionable women, or become useless women who depend on their fathers and husbands. Where is this phenomenon not prevalent among female graduates these days?</p>
<p>Recently, it has become even more nonsensical. Many female school authorities, rushing to follow meaningless trends, are even using the slogan "Our school aims to cultivate good wives and wise mothers" to attract attention. Isn't "good wives and wise mothers" something that has already been sufficient even before school education? Aren't the readily available grandmothers, mothers, and aunts, as well as the hidden "Daughter's Manual," "Four Books for Women," "Admonitions for Women," and "Analects for Women," already enough for education? What is the use of running women's middle schools, women's normal schools, women's universities, and so on? Yet, our female school authorities are still so muddle-headed, still taking pride in educating today's women to become slaves of the family and husbands! They don't think at all about creating more "talents" in our semi-colonial nation to use as the basis for striving for freedom, but instead, they are manufacturing a large number of submissive "slaves" to become obedient citizens after national subjugation. How urgently does this need to be corrected?</p>
<p>The most important thing in today's women's education is to remove their habit of dependence on others, their mentality of seeking only comfort, their depressed spirits, and their affected behaviors; and to build their concept of "independent individuals," the courage to fight for freedom and equality, the enthusiasm to serve society, and the concern for international phenomena… Only by doing this can one stand on the podium of a women's school without shame, and only by everyone striving to do so can women's education, which is on the verge of collapse, be saved.</p>
<p>It is said that Ms. Chen plans to go to Germany and Italy first to investigate the so-called "women returning to the home" movement. This inevitably makes people worry. Western women already have the ability to join thousands of professional sectors, which is precisely where their women's education is excellent. Ms. Chen is not going to investigate these areas, but instead is paying attention to the regressive women's return-to-home movement in Germany and Italy! This will not only provide the students of Suzhou Women's Middle School, whom Ms. Chen dismissed, with the grounds to mock her as "old-fashioned," but it will also have endless hidden dangers for the future of domestic women's education. "Women are members of society, not members of the family" – this truth should be as unshakeable as a rock. Whether this trip is a merit or a sin for women, Ms. Chen is indeed at a serious crossroads. It is hoped that she will correct the direction of the long march in time to avoid a futile journey of ten thousand miles.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Comments on Xiao Wenjun's "Self-Encouragement and Self-Exertion" <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Lan</p>
<p>At a time when debates on women's issues have long been silent, Miss Jenny and Xiao Wenjun have launched a heated debate on the issue of women's self-encouragement and self-exertion in recent issues of the Women's Garden and the Women's Weekly of the Da Wan Bao. This is something that deserves our attention. Because this kind of debate, regardless of who wins or loses, can always give us higher theoretical guidance.</p>
<p>In their several debates, the opinions of both sides have been fully and concretely expressed. To summarize, Xiao Wenjun advocates that women only need to encourage and exert themselves to achieve liberation and should not rely on men. Miss Jenny's opinion is the opposite; relying solely on women's self-encouragement and self-exertion is not enough. "We should unite with conscious men to jointly complete the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal work and build a rational society" to achieve women's liberation. Here, we spectators also have the opportunity to distinguish right from wrong, and at the same time, we will become participants from being spectators. I agree with Miss Jenny's opinion and oppose Xiao Wenjun's proposition.</p>
<p>Xiao Wenjun actually expounded his extremely incorrect theory in the article "Self-Encouragement and Self-Exertion" (Women's Weekly of the Da Wan Bao, Issue 33), revealing his insufficient understanding of this issue! Xiao Wenjun believes that women's self-encouragement and self-exertion is the only way to liberate women. He said: "As for the women's issue, it is a matter of the women's class itself (the misuse of this term shows Xiao Wenjun's lack of common sense. We should always tell Xiao Wenjun: Women are not a class, but an abstract distinction of sex.), just as the labor issue belongs to the working class." He also said: "Women's own affairs must be solved by women themselves. We must encourage and exert ourselves to break through the iron gate that has been locked for a long time!" After saying this, he further believes that this passage "has not a single mistake"! But in our opinion, this passage is fundamentally wrong.</p>
<p>First, the women's issue is by no means simply a matter for women themselves, but rather a link in the entire social issue. Therefore, among women, there are indeed women who need liberation and women who do not need liberation, and among men, there are also men who need to liberate women and men who do not need to liberate women.</p>
<p>Second, so-called self-encouragement and self-exertion must have the conditions to be able to encourage and exert oneself. Self-encouragement and self-exertion that is "conceived out of thin air in one's own mind" is the ideological game of idealists, otherwise it is like the sorcery of Chu-qi-bian! "The iron gate that has been locked for a long time," if it does not have the conditions to break it open, but wants the people locked inside the iron gate to encourage and exert themselves and ask them to break it open, is obviously a deception. Under the feudal system, there were no conditions for women to encourage and exert themselves, so there could be no women's liberation movement. In capitalist society, because these conditions exist, British suffragettes were able to "break windows, destroy mailboxes, and hold great parades." But this kind of self-encouragement and self-exertion is not simply a matter for women themselves, but rather most men in Britain at that time thoroughly advocated democratic politics and sympathized with and helped women's suffrage movement. Speaking of the current women in our country, who are being tightly locked by the iron gate of imperialism and feudal forces, it is not enough to rely solely on women's self-encouragement and self-exertion to break this iron gate. We must unite with anti-imperialist and anti-feudal men and "fight with all our strength." Because only in this way can the current social problems be solved, and at the same time, the women's issue can be solved.</p>
<p>Xiao Wenjun's observation of facts does have the suspicion of being not profound or even distorting reality. Now most men want to build a rational society with gender equality, and they are bleeding and fighting everywhere. This is a real fact, but he said: "...Whether men will automatically realize and come to help women is still a problem...They are still infatuated with male-centered society." Now many women are locked in the feudal iron gate and want to encourage and exert themselves but have no way to encourage and exert themselves, and they are not allowed to encourage and exert themselves, which is also a fact. But Xiao Wenjun is standing outside the "iron gate" and happily talking about the cool breeze: "Women must automatically remove the curtain of darkness and liberate their own souls from the devil's worship." Of course, we do not oppose women "automatically removing the curtain of darkness," but society must give them the conditions to be able to "automatically." With this condition, they will immediately "automatically" arise without Xiao Wenjun's earnest encouragement. For example, prisoners in prison find conditions that allow them to escape safely, and they immediately "automatically" escape.</p>
<p>The phrase "self-encouragement and self-exertion" originally has two meanings. The rulers use various systems to bind the ruled, deprive them of all possibilities of self-encouragement and self-exertion, and then say to them: Your being ruled is your own fault, because you do not encourage and exert yourselves. This is one aspect. On the other hand, when the ruled realize that their own strength is enough to liberate themselves, they rise up to resist the rulers, which is purposeful and conscious revolutionary self-encouragement and self-exertion. Xiao Wenjun's "self-encouragement and self-exertion" belongs to the former. Otherwise, it is a virtual self-encouragement and self-exertion "conceived out of thin air in one's own mind."</p>
<p>The women's issue is a link in the social issue, and it must be solved simultaneously with the social issue. Anyone with a little common sense of social science can understand this. Only Xiao Wenjun does not understand such obvious principles, but uses the so-called self-encouragement and self-exertion, a slightly deceptive term, to oppose the women's issue and the social issue, and to oppose women and men. I think this is an error that cannot be ignored. Here, I can only advise Xiao Wenjun to quickly withdraw the battle flag, retreat and think again.</p>
<h3 id="e203">After Watching "The Goddess of Freedom" <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Zhen</p>
<p>In a male-centered society, many men often fight over women as if they were property. The purpose of their fighting is only to satisfy their own desire for possession. Their sweet words and various methods deceive many women into thinking that this is love; as a result, they fall for their tricks and are treated as playthings. But women are people, and also honorable people. Why should they be the playthings of men and let them be played with? Of course, many of them are out of necessity, but there are also many people who belittle themselves, willingly giving up their due freedom to be men's playthings. However, intellectual women should at least understand that this will make women's status in society lower day by day, so they should take their due responsibility to fulfill their due obligations to society and regain their due freedom. They should also understand what true love is and oppose men's pursuit of women with a playful attitude. Since the May Fourth Movement, we have seen many women working hard on anti-imperialist and revolutionary work. This past history can give intellectual women a powerful stimulus, making them think about the women's work of the past and work harder in the present.</p>
<p>"The Goddess of Freedom" is a story written with these themes in mind. It clearly points out that in today's society, women and men need to work together to advance society, and it opposes men treating women as playthings. Therefore, it is a work that is most suitable for women to watch.</p>
<p>As for the technical aspects of the performance, I, an outsider, dare not make any criticisms.</p>

<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>The cold wind was blowing, and scattered ice and snow fell from the trees with a "dada" sound. The sun shone from the side, making the mud pile patchily bright and dark, with long shadows of tree trunks. A dark hole, with a pile of snow at the entrance. The little nun ran forward, dug up a handful of that snow, kneaded it into a ball, and ate it as she walked back to her original position.</p>
<p>"Do you want to eat?"</p>
<p>"Okay! Give me a little!" Xiu Zhen took a bite, and shivered from the cold, spitting out half of it. She shifted her position to a stone where there was sunlight.</p>
<p>"Originally, there was a lot of firewood to collect after the snow pressed down, but now there's very little...It's been cut bare, and there are many people collecting it." The little nun looked at Xiu Zhen's firewood basket and said, "Why did you only collect so little?" She immediately stood up and quickly picked and broke off non-withered firewood, putting it into Xiu Zhen's firewood basket. "Look! This kind is also good: it can be burned after drying in the sun for a few days." She pointed to the green and fresh branches of the small pine tree.</p>
<p>Xiu Zhen stood up and imitated her, picking as well, and the two of them helped pull out a tree root exposed in the yellow mud.</p>
<p>"What are the mountains in Shanghai like?" the little nun asked.</p>
<p>"Shanghai doesn't have mountains."</p>
<p>"No mountains? What do you burn to cook?"</p>
<p>"We burn everything, but we burn coal."</p>
<p>"Is it foreign firewood? Hey: there's a kind of foreign dried fish, red, people call it Dongyang dried fish."</p>
<p>The sound of gongs came from afar, carried from the narrow, ribbon-like river visible from the mountain.</p>
<p>"What's going on? They're beating gongs over there," Xiu Zhen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"It's a foreign goods boat. Look, look, it's small. There's Dongyang dried fish for sale on this boat, as well as foreign cloth, foreign...It's really pretty!"</p>
<p>A rustling sound came from the left. They looked and saw a man. They were so scared that they didn't have time to escape.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, what are you doing? It's me!" the man said, walking closer to them. He was carrying a wild boar in his hand.</p>
<p>"You bastard! I thought for sure you'd been caught this time," the little nun said, laughing and scolding.</p>
<p>This man turned out to be a fellow thief of firewood, but he didn't come to steal firewood this time. He had set up a trap on the ridge, and was lucky enough to trap a wild boar today.</p>
<p>"Oh my! You caught this...!" the little nun said in surprise and with a hint of envy. She felt around on the back of the wild boar.</p>
<p>"You came too?" the man looked at Xiu Zhen and said. He looked happy. Because Xiu Zhen was his old companion. When she hadn't gone to Shanghai yet, they often went to the mountains or fields together to catch grasshoppers and pick snails. At that time, the little nun was very small and didn't know anything. Now the three of them were together, and they all helped Xiu Zhen collect firewood on the way back, especially the man, who helped collect even more.</p>
<p>"This way, he won't see us," the little nun said.</p>
<p>"Have you ever been caught by them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, once I was beaten by them, and I had to kneel in the local temple! For a whole afternoon."</p>
<p>"You still dare to come back?"</p>
<p>"What else can I do? If I don't come back, I won't have anything to burn."</p>

<h3 id="e205">Section 4: Contraception and Abortion <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The capitalist social system, which is already on the verge of collapse, is not only a shackle on the development of economic productivity, but also a shackle on the development of human reproductive capacity. Constant imperialist aggressive wars and counter-revolutionary wars have killed and maimed countless healthy people, and periodic economic panics have created vast numbers of unemployed and starving masses. In addition, workers who can only sustain their personal lives, farmers who continue to go bankrupt, "national slaves" in colonies, and small clerks and shop assistants who do not have the economic ability to marry all become victims of this social system, unable to perform the reproductive tasks naturally endowed to them. Their economic life determines their sexual life. They are not only economically exploited, but also sexually exploited. Because they do not have the economic ability to organize family life, they dare not attempt legal formal marriage, and they are afraid of having children. They can only seek opportunities to vent their desires in all aspects of society without assuming any responsibility. Thus, the so-called "friendly marriage" approaching promiscuity, public and private prostitution, frequent divorce, infanticide, abandonment of children, contraception, abortion, and other immoral social phenomena have occurred.</p>
<p>Under the above social relations, contraception and abortion have become social necessities and have appeared, and this knowledge has quickly spread among young men and women in the middle and lower classes. In particular, middle and lower-class intellectual women and professional women have very commonly adopted this method. Because even if they are formally married, once they have a child, their career will immediately have problems, and there is no possibility of raising children. Therefore, women have a greater determination to use contraception than men. If contraception is not successful and they become pregnant, they will resort to the tenth step method, namely abortion. Regarding this issue, we have good statistical data that we can refer to.</p>
<p>Dr. Davis of the United States questioned a thousand women about the use of contraceptives, and as a result, he learned that 730, or 73%, used this method. Among them, 520 were graduates of universities and specialized schools, 40 received women's school education, 20 were teachers in private schools, 47 were students in specialized schools, and 103 were graduates of women's schools and normal schools. ("Bankruptcy of Marriage")</p>
<p>According to research by the Carnegie Institute of the United States, among 697 women, there were a total of 1,351 births and 1,848 abortions. That is, the number of abortions exceeded the number of births. (Ibid.)</p>
<p>The above is the practice in the United States, but alarming statistics have also occurred in Tokyo, Japan. That is, within the jurisdiction of the police department alone, there were a total of 47 places that conducted business in childbirth regulation and menstruation consultation. The numbers reported to the authorities by these operators showed that the average number of people who visited these operators each month was 5,076, and their average monthly income was 9,850 yuan. Since its establishment, the Mother Friends Association, which specializes in abortion, has handled more than 100,000 cases of menstruation consultation in four years. The average number of inquiries sent from various places every day is more than 100, and the number of direct visitors also reaches 20 to 30. The number of people who have undergone abortion surgery has reached several hundred. (Fifty Lectures for Women)</p>
<p>The refinement of contraceptive drugs and the development of abortion technology have further promoted the above situation. The rulers of capitalist society, on the one hand, regard contraception and abortion as sins and want to use the law to stop them, but on the other hand, they allow capitalists to manufacture contraceptive drugs in large quantities and openly promote them. This is exactly like encouraging tobacco cultivation and banning smoking at the same time, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Capitalist countries, in order to save the family and marriage systems that are on the verge of bankruptcy, and in order to increase the population to be used as cannon fodder in future wars, legally prohibit the sale of contraceptives and prohibit abortion. But this kind of law, from the perspective of women, is based on the sacrifice of women. Under the current society, most women who are trapped in poverty and misfortune find that giving birth to children is entirely the pain and burden of women themselves, and neither the state nor men will share her pain. Therefore, women must have the right to decide whether or not to endure this pain, that is to say, women should have the right to contraception or abortion. The reason why we oppose this kind of law is precisely this point.</p>
<p>I remember that several years ago, Ms. Sanger of the United States came to our country and promoted her neo-Malthusianism, which advocated the implementation of birth control through methods such as contraception and abortion. She believes that women have absolute freedom to decide for themselves whether to be mothers or how many children to have, regardless of the attitude of men, this issue always belongs to women's own rights. Although Mrs. Geff's so-called birth control system is a passive method of reformism, the concept of "free motherhood" that she pointed out is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>We must be clear that under a rational social system, the unnatural phenomena of contraception and abortion will not occur except in special circumstances. Human reproduction is originally a very natural instinctive requirement. Under unavoidable living conditions, men and women who have to use contraception are also unwilling to permanently damage their reproductive function. In particular, most women have a strong desire to be mothers. If society can give them preferential conditions to be mothers, then contraception and abortion will naturally disappear without being prohibited—there is an example here. Several years ago, American women invited a female inspector who had just returned from the Soviet Union and asked her to talk about women's lives in the Soviet Union. She said: "In the Soviet Union, contraception and abortion are extremely free. If you want to have an abortion, the state hospital provides free surgery, which is very safe." Speaking of this, the audience said in unison: "Then they can all not have children, that's so good!" But the female inspector shook her head and said, "No! They like to have children! Because women who have children are given special preferential treatment by the state. Both economically and socially, the privileges of mothers are recognized. They have lovely children, as well as state security and social privileges. What's not to like!" After hearing this, everyone suddenly realized!</p>

<p>Shanghai North City Middle School 20th Anniversary Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e206">Foreword <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Naikang</p>
<p>As the ancient saying goes, "Its beginning is simple, but its end will be grand." Simplicity leading to grandeur is inevitable, not accidental. Therefore, when creating an artifact or establishing an enterprise, hoping it will be successful and enduring, one understands that today's simplicity and ease contain future grandeur and difficulty. Education, as one of all undertakings, is no exception. If one can overcome simplicity but not grandeur and difficulty, advancement will be swift but retreat will be rapid, and failure is inevitable.</p>
<p>When I founded this school, I was always filled with trepidation and fear. What was I afraid of? I was afraid that continuing the past and opening up the future would not be easy; that mid-way setbacks would lead to an abrupt end. This was not my wish! Indeed, five years after its establishment, the number of students increased sharply, and the rented buildings were insufficient. We had to plan the construction of spacious buildings; with no place for further education, we had to add a middle school. After another five years, we encountered the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War and the Feng-Zhi conflict. We persevered through hardship. Even amidst the chaos of war, music and learning never ceased. After another five years, we suffered a national disaster, and the school buildings were burned, leaving only rubble. After calming the pain and reflecting, we had to urgently plan for recovery to reassure the students who had come from afar. Thus, we cleared the ashes, rebuilt new buildings, and after a year of operation, we were fortunate to restore the old appearance. Now, another five years have passed. Rural areas are bankrupt, society is in decline, and economic support is far more difficult than it was ten years ago. Compared to the hardship of twenty years ago, it is not only immeasurable, but also inexpressible! These twenty years of experience include the grandeur and difficulty that were initially anticipated, as well as those that were initially unanticipated. The so-called grandeur and difficulty are actually tenfold or a hundredfold greater than anticipated!</p>
<p>My trepidation in the past stemmed from the grandeur and difficulty that was both anticipated and unanticipated over these twenty years. However, when this compounded hardship occurred, I only knew to resolutely bear it and calmly face it, never again becoming apprehensive, lest I undermine my own ambition. The fact that this school has been spared from collapse and still stands tall today is entirely due to the protection of the gentlemen of the Board of Directors and the enthusiastic educators in society. My trepidation in the past, but not dejection today, is also due to some slight achievements.</p>
<p>Today, our school has reached its 20th anniversary. All of you who care about this school are surely familiar with the experiences of these twenty years and need not be told in detail. However, I cannot help but feel trepidation and fear for the next twenty years. What am I afraid of? I am afraid that continuing the past and opening up the future will not be easy; that mid-way setbacks will lead to an abrupt end. This is not my wish! I can only maintain the spirit of the past and encourage and exhort each other with all the teachers and staff and all the students of the school. When compounded hardship occurs, I can only resolutely bear it and calmly face it, never again becoming apprehensive, lest I undermine my own ambition! The compilation of the 20th Anniversary Special Issue begins with these words, serving as a foreword.</p>
<h3 id="e207">School History <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Our school, originally named "Shibei Public School," has been established for twenty years. These twenty years can be broadly divided into six periods: From August of the fourth year of the Republic of China to January of the fifth year, was the "Pioneering" period; from February of the fifth year to January of the ninth year, was the "Improvement" period; from February of the ninth year to January of the eleventh year, was the "Construction" period; from February of the eleventh year to the twentieth year, was the "Expansion" period; from January of the twenty-first year to the end of the twenty-second year, was the "Hardship" period; and from the twenty-third year onward, is the "Revival" period. Now, a brief outline of its development is provided, so that those in the world who are concerned about education can understand the school's history.</p>
<p>(1) Pioneering Period The founder of our school, Principal Tang Boqi, believed that Shanghai was the focus of attention both domestically and internationally, and also a culturally developed area. However, educational undertakings were controlled by foreigners, and important authority was lost, which he deeply regretted. Moreover, at that time, there were no well-established schools run by Chinese in the Shibei area. Therefore, in the autumn of the fourth year of the Republic of China, he used his private funds to establish our school in Qingxiang Lane on the North Station Boundary Road; because it was located in the north of Shanghai, it was named Shibei Public School. Although funds were quickly depleted, the scale and facilities were simple and crude, but in terms of teaching and guidance, there was no negligence. Teachers and students encouraged each other with spiritual education.</p>
<p>(2) Improvement Period In the spring of the fifth year, Principal Tang consulted with prominent figures in Shanghai, such as Mr. Li Denghui, to establish a board of directors to serve as a maintenance and guidance organization. More than thirty talented individuals from Jiangsu and Zhejiang joined successively, either assisting with annual funding or helping to plan progress. As a result, the number of students coming to the school increased sharply, and teaching and guidance were improved accordingly. After inspections by educational administrative organs, unanimous praise was given, and the school's reputation in society continued to grow.</p>
<p>(3) Construction Period In the spring of the ninth year, the number of male and female students had reached more than five hundred. Although school buildings had been added, they were still crowded. Therefore, Principal Tang suggested to the board of directors that they plan to raise funds to build school buildings themselves to facilitate teaching. This was unanimously approved, and a school building construction committee was organized, with Mr. Jian Zhaonan elected as the chairman. Mr. Jian took the lead in donating 20,000 yuan and 1,000 shares of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. Mr. Wang Rutang, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Yiting, Wu Yunzhai, Liu Hongsheng, Li Boqin, Lao Jingshiu, and Shen Tianxin also each pledged large sums to promote the project. Other directors successively pledged donations or helped to solicit donations from various circles, sincerely supporting the effort, which was deeply appreciated! The following summer, six acres of land were purchased on Yongxing Road in Zhabei, and the Nanyang Construction Company was commissioned to survey the land and draw up plans for a large-scale construction project. After two years of operation, the magnificent and spacious school building was finally completed. In addition to the auditorium and classrooms, which could accommodate 600 students, there were also dormitories, dining halls, offices, libraries, sanatoriums, reception rooms, as well as bathrooms, shops, kitchens, and specimen and instrument rooms, all equipped and arranged to a basic scale. The school had a large playground for sports, so even large-scale events could be held without worrying about a suitable venue.</p>
<p>(4) Expansion Period After the completion of the new school building, the number of primary and secondary school students increased year by year. In the eleventh year, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, primary and secondary schools uniformly adopted the new school system. In the sixteenth year, a school affairs committee was organized to vigorously promote party ideology education. By the seventeenth year, after an investigation by the Education Bureau, the primary and secondary schools were approved for registration. In the summer of the eighteenth year, the number of places was expanded, the regulations were revised, and a senior high school department was established to achieve greater accomplishments. Well-known figures in the education field were hired to serve as teachers. Considering the needs of the times, the senior high school was temporarily organized with a mixed system, so that students could easily pursue further education or employment in the future. In the summer of the twentieth year, the middle school submitted a report to the Shanghai Education Bureau, which was forwarded to the Ministry of Education. After review and approval, it was approved for filing. Efforts were being made to actively expand and promote education, but unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident suddenly occurred.</p>
<p>(5) Hardship Period At 11:30 p.m. on January 28 of the twenty-first year, the sound of gunfire and artillery fire broke out, and the war began. On February 1, Japanese planes circled over the middle school, dropping bombs, and the school staff did not dare to stay any longer. On March 2, our army retreated to the second line of defense, and the Japanese army occupied Zhabei that evening. The fire in the Yongxing Road area lasted for three days and nights, and the middle school was also burned down. On May 17, the Japanese army withdrew from Zhabei, and the school sent staff to take over, but only dangerous walls and ruins remained, a scorched earth, with losses of more than 220,000 yuan. On April 8, the middle school rented temporary school buildings on Maigen Road and continued classes. The number of students who attended was less than one-third of the previous number, which was undeniably simple and crude. When school started in the autumn, the number of students increased sharply, and the school buildings became even more cramped. Therefore, houses at 1095 Xinzha Road were rented and moved to on December 10.</p>
<p>(6) Revival Period The rented houses for the middle school were not only considered unsanitary due to the lack of lighting and ventilation, but also suffered from the lack of sports fields due to being in a busy city. Therefore, a revival design committee was established, and a general meeting was held on March 5 of the twenty-second year. In addition to some of the original directors, many well-known figures from the party, political, business, and academic circles were present. Mr. Chen Aishi was elected as the chairman, and Mr. Wu Kaixian and Yu Hongjun as the vice chairmen, to carry out the revival plan. On October 21, construction began on the original site on Yongxing Road to rebuild the middle school building, which was contracted by Lu Genji Construction Company. In January of the twenty-third year, the school moved into the new building, and the initial phase of the revival was roughly completed. However, the primary school building was quite cramped due to the increase in the number of children, and the facilities were mostly simple. The addition of a kindergarten made it even more insufficient. Therefore, in May of this year, six new three-story buildings at the western end of Yongqing Lane on the boundary road were selected and moved into during the period. From now on, attention should be paid to training and teaching, and equipment should be improved, so that both spirit and form can progress simultaneously. It is hoped that all gentlemen who are enthusiastic about education will offer their advice and generously provide assistance, which would not only be fortunate for this school, but also for local education! A brief outline is presented, and it is hoped that it will be reviewed.</p>

<p>Yue Weishibei has been nurturing talents in a proper way, and the establishment of the school for twenty years has shown remarkable achievements. The difficult creation has been revived and prospered again. May all the students not be negligent or wasteful. Ma Chaojun</p>
<p>Mr. Tang's promotion of education is better than the people's. The four groups of roads were started from humble beginnings. Starting from small to middle, the scale gradually increased, and the number of students increased by thousands each year. Therefore, the temporary residence was changed, and the school site was urgently managed. The strings and reeds of the northern city have reached both preparations. After the January 28th Incident, the good land was only scorched and the previous achievements were abandoned. He then encouraged his courage and declared his ambition to run around and manage, continuing the extinction and replacing it. The old view was restored in an instant. Everyone said that it was easy to start. From the beginning to the present, the stars have been around for twenty years, and the long-standing glory has been rich in history. Promoting education like this is worthy of being shown with the ear pen. The sighing words are inexhaustible. Xu Shaodi</p>
<p>Oh, public school, five youths and education are implemented to achieve success after destruction, and no foundation is built. Further improve the teaching to create outstanding talents, and the talents are rising. Xu Fu</p>
<p>Thorn heart creates peace, and great is this revival. Thinking of the pain in the future to save the nation, there is no regret. Our spirit will not perish, and our education will not perish. Wang Luyi</p>
<p>Educating talents, gentlemen honor it. The foundation of creating Xia is in this. North of the Shanghai River, there is a high wall, and the talents gather together, and the reputation is growing day by day. Running for twenty years, it is new every day. Chen Zhishuo</p>
<p>Pine trees that have been intertwined for a long time are proud of the frost and snow. What is the difference between the spirit of this school and this? At first, the rental of private houses was followed by the construction of wide buildings, but suddenly they were destroyed by robbers, and the sound of books was interrupted. Finally, the revival was celebrated with joy, and the environment was created to become the masters. Wang Laifang</p>
<p>I, Shibei, bottles from Jin, Yang, British talents, Le Qing, fame spreads far and wide. Suffering from the soldiers, the hardships have been tasted, the management has been bleak, and the old school has been restored. The new house stands majestically, and the full door of peaches and plums is fragrant. The 20th anniversary is a gathering of crowns and gowns, forever immortal, and the mountains are high and the water is long. Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>Enthusiastic education, hard management, continuous efforts, the ambition will eventually be achieved, the grand hall is magnificent, the 20th anniversary is the glory of the school. Yao Mulian</p>
<p>Yi Gu built a school, Yin Xu Zhou Xiang, and Yi Zi Shibei compared his traces to Qi Guang. The great difficulty is that the wind is blowing, and it is just right to catch the disaster. The prosperity is followed by the night and the night. Yue Si Palace Yu seeks to get his wall, and Yu is a national tool, and the order is infinite. Niu Shiyu</p>
<p>Ten years to plant trees, lush and green, double the years, to build beams. Our school cultivates materials, and the metaphor is planting, following the nature, and becoming lush. Living, gathering, teaching, and training, Yue Ke Zhao Wu, lying on the firewood and tasting the gall, expanding the territory. Our school makes people, shaping the past sages, happy education and preparation of talents, using capital to save the country. The students come with books, holding scriptures and asking for knowledge, and all arts are comprehensive. Etiquette and justice are encouraged, and integrity and shame are promoted. There are many strategies for the policy, and the special policies and orders are followed. Education, the great road is in decline, the raging waves cannot be saved, who can be the pillar? Only my Tang Gong can guide the younger generation, courage, forgiveness and benevolence, and write it as a clear instruction. After twenty years, stick to this without change, inducing encouragement and exhortation, and the measures are appropriate. The creation is difficult, and the great achievements are made. I respectfully write the rough words, and I borrow to express my admiration and joy. Eulogy of the entire faculty and staff of this school</p>
<p>Only our alma mater, founded in the fourth year of the Republic of China, has always struggled with the will of the nation. The initial intention of establishing the school was to save the destruction and destruction. The beginning was simple, and the houses were only a few. A sudden leap forward, the sound was overflowing, and the books were numerous, and the corners were sad. Plan with the board of directors, prepare materials and gather workers, and the towering mansions will widely protect the children. Junior high school and high school have been added successively, and the clouds are steaming, perfect and flawless. The Songhu War started, and the school was destroyed. The design was restored, and the morality was not returned. Scrimping and persevering, rebuilding the school, Yongxing must not be replaced! The great cause of revival is clearly seen, and I respectfully inform the people of the country, who encourage each other! Eulogy of the Alumni Association</p>

<p>— Zhang Li</p>
<p>Shanghai Shibei Middle School, formerly known as Shibei Public School, was founded in the autumn of the fourth year of the Republic of China. In the early days of its creation, it taxed residents' houses, and only ran a few classes in elementary school, with dozens of students. For more than ten years, it has grown from elementary school to the point where it has more than a thousand students and has built its own school building, which is beautiful and well-equipped, which is already commendable. By the twentieth year of the Republic of China, it suffered the disaster of January 28th, and the entire school was destroyed. Finally, thanks to the courage and struggle of Principal Tang Naikang, it was restored to its former appearance in three years. Everyone praises its rapid revival, but I alone admire its sound political foundation. England's constitutional government is praised by the world, and those who discuss the origin of the English people say that England's political system is naturally growing. Like trees, they are only sprouts at the beginning, but if they can adapt to the environment and keep pace with the times, they will eventually flourish and grow into giant materials. This is the meaning of natural growth. Not only is politics like this, but also all kinds of undertakings. Why not? Shibei Middle School has a simple foundation, but it is full of vitality, responding to the needs of the environment and advancing with the times. The achievements have been remarkable, and the reputation has grown day by day. Once it suffers an unexpected destruction, it will naturally win the sympathy of the society, and the enthusiasm and perseverance of those who preside over it will be able to achieve the effect of revival in three years. Now, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the school, it will publish a special issue to celebrate its prosperity. I have been asked to write an article from afar, and I will write what I have seen and return it. Now that the national crisis is not over, patriots and people of good will are competing to talk about revival, and perhaps they will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>— Qin Runqing</p>
<p>In May of the 24th year, Mr. Tang Boqi came with a letter and said that our school building had been newly completed and it was also the 20th anniversary of its founding. We plan to publish a special commemorative issue and ask for a literary policy. I humbly declined. I thought that Shibei Middle School had been in business since the fourth year of the Republic of China under the leadership of Mr. Tang. From elementary school to high school, there were more than ten students. The students of the built giant mansions were well-equipped and were admired by people in the community. Although the difficulty of the Shanghai War was destroyed by the flames of war, Gu did not return soon and was able to rebuild the school building. Mr. Tang's perseverance is admirable. I would like to say in praise:</p>
<p>The vast school building is where the students live, and education is used to promote life so that they can plant their roots in the beginning. The students gather here to hear extensively and learn reputation. The strings and songs are full of foreign customs and cultures, which truly opens a good model. The national crisis suddenly broke out, and the Chinese houses became tombs. Many scholars lost education, and who can support the elegance? Only this Mr. Tang can glorify the old plan, and his great achievements can be specially recorded.</p>

<p>Shibei Middle School has been founded since the fourth year of the Republic of China and has been around for twenty years. The school building was completely destroyed in the Battle of Shanghai on January 28th. After the ceasefire agreement was completed, Dehua continued to follow the order and was sent to take over the Shanghai troop withdrawal area. He witnessed the original site of the school being destroyed by the flames of war, and he only thought of the separation of millet. Nai Zhe Principal Tang Boqi initiated a revival plan and worked hard to restore the old view. His perseverance and enthusiasm are admirable. Looking back, the Prime Minister advocated revolution and encouraged himself to make his ambition come true, and he showed it to future generations. This time, the rebuilding of the school building in Shibei Middle School coincided with the 20th anniversary of its founding. It was the heart of the principals and school directors who maintained education and never forgot it. There are many people who have obtained the teachings of today. Only a few words are recorded as a memorial. Yushan Guo Dehua</p>

<p>Telecommunications Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e220">A Review of the First Anniversary of the Telecommunications Administration Conference <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>What is the extent of business consolidation? What are the methods to facilitate the people?</p>
<p>Last year, in order to reorganize the national telecommunications administration, the Ministry of Communications convened a telecommunications administration conference in the capital on September 4th. Time flies quickly, and it has been a year since then. All the proposals and resolutions of the conference are fundamental to the reorganization of the telecommunications administration, and its business aspects are closely related to the public's use of telecommunications. The author has read the minutes of the conference and knows that most members, in view of the economic difficulties of the telecommunications administration, proposed revising the current rates to increase revenue. However, the conference resolved that the pricing issue should start with consolidating business and facilitating the people, and that unified pricing should still be maintained. This shows that even in times of difficulty for the telecommunications administration, the Ministry of Communications could not bear to increase the burden on the people. What is the extent of the Ministry of Communications' business consolidation this year? And what are the methods to facilitate the people? These are questions that the public wants to know and should review. A summary report is provided below:</p>
<p>A. Regarding facilitating the people:</p>
<p>There are two ways to facilitate the people: (1) reduce the burden on the people, and (2) expand the scope of business. Regarding the former: (1) express long-distance telephone calls were changed to double the rate (originally triple the rate), (2) ship telegram rates were reduced, (3) methods for free or paid official telegrams were established, (4) telegraphic transfer fees were reduced (originally 60 cents for each telegram not exceeding 20 characters, plus a handling fee of 25 cents, now changed to 50 cents, and the extra fee was canceled). (5) Intra-city telegrams are charged at a quarter of the price (old regulations charged half the price). (6) For private or public welfare telegrams in Chinese or vernacular, the name of the receiving place, regardless of how many characters, is counted as two characters. (7) For private or public welfare telegrams in Chinese cipher or foreign languages, as well as various other telegrams, the name of the receiving place is generally counted as one character. (8) The recipient's title (e.g., Principal, Director, Chairman) and designation (e.g., Mr., Madam, etc.) in private or public welfare telegrams in Chinese are included in the recipient's address and name for character count. All of these have been implemented and are closely related to public payment.</p>
<p>Regarding the latter: (1) direct communication was opened between China and Italy via wireless radio, (2) eight domestic radio stations were established, (3) a total of 300 reporting and talking business offices and agency offices were established, (4) six local telephone bureaus were established, (5) general rules for public telephone business and rules for soliciting merchants to manage public telephones were stipulated, (6) general rules for local telephone business and domestic telegram business were established, (7) public telephones were installed at stations, (8) each station of the Jiangnan Railway was commissioned to handle telegrams, (9) the scope of communication telegrams was expanded, (10) international Easter greeting telegrams were opened, (11) methods for telephone bureaus to answer telephone users' inquiries about various local affairs were stipulated, (12) methods for county-run local telephone or rural telephone lines to communicate with the Ministry of Communications' long-distance or local telephone lines were stipulated, (13) methods for broadcasting and publicizing telecommunications business were stipulated. All of these have been implemented and are closely related to public communication.</p>
<p>B. Regarding consolidating business:</p>
<p>The consolidation of business can be divided into external and internal aspects. The external aspect is aimed at facilitating the people, and the internal aspect is based on work efficiency. Since the methods to facilitate the people are as mentioned above, the way to consolidate business is more than halfway there. The outline of the methods to increase work efficiency is described below:</p>
<p>The performance of work efficiency has two aspects: (1) speed and (2) accuracy. The two are half related to mechanical circuits and half related to office procedures. There have been many improvements in the past year. In addition to the construction of circuits belonging to the scope of engineering, which is not to be described, the Ministry of Communications, based on the complexity of the reporting service and the needs of political and military communications, has adjusted the national bureau's circuits at any time, allocated machinery and manpower, and stipulated the size standards for various machine capacities. If a certain capacity is exceeded, machines are appropriately added. It is also planned to set up a special machine in radio stations in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xiamen, etc., to communicate directly with international radio stations. The above-mentioned machines have all been purchased and are being installed. Before installation, a line will be installed by the Shanghai Bureau to communicate directly with the international radio station. International telegrams sent or transferred by the Beijing, Tianjin, Ping, and Hankou Bureaus will be sent by the Shanghai Bureau using the Kleinschmidt machine to the international radio station. The telegrams received by the station will be transferred to the Beijing, Tianjin, Ping, and Hankou Bureaus by the Shanghai Bureau. The busy circuits of the Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Hankou, and Qing Bureaus have all been modified with Kleinschmidt machines or teleprinters to send and receive telegrams. Various detailed methods that have been stipulated can also be listed as follows: (1) methods for receiving telegrams when the bureau station circuit is obstructed, (2) implementation of the method of writing public telegram indexes, (3) method of translating and sending telegrams in Chinese code, (4) consolidation of the method of delivering telegrams, (5) audit method of receiving and sending places, (6) weather telegram broadcasting method, (7) telegram error or delay report form, (8) time calibration method, (9) telephone user charging method, (10) wireless transmission receiving station name method. All of these are concrete methods for consolidating business.</p>
<p>In all fairness, in recent years, the Ministry of Communications seems to have made efforts to implement the two points of facilitating the people and consolidating business. Within the possible scope, improvements should continue to be made. Many cases regarding the consolidation of telecommunications administration were discussed at the Telecommunications Administration Conference, and there are also many regarding business matters, which are mostly internal matters and have been handled one after another. This is only a brief description of those related to the general public's use of telecommunications. It can be seen that the conference is not comparable to those that "discuss but do not decide, decide but do not act, and act without force."</p>
<h3 id="e221">Merger of Telegraph Bureau and Telephone Bureau <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>It has been observed that in various countries, the postal and telecommunications transportation agencies, where state-run, are mostly merged. For example, the post offices in the United Kingdom and Japan all handle both postal and telecommunications services. This is to seek convenience for public communication and to save personnel and expenses. China's postal and telecommunications undertakings, because they were established separately, have been under the same ministry (formerly the Ministry of Posts and Communications, later renamed the Ministry of Communications). However, the departments are separate, and have continued for decades. There have been discussions about merging, but they have always been obstructed by the environment. People with insight regret this!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the wired telegraph bureau, wireless radio station, and telephone bureau, which are all under the telecommunications agency, were also separated in the past and did not communicate with each other. Foreigners who first came to China often suspected that they were commercial in nature. The reason is that in other countries, the state-run telecommunications undertakings rarely have three business organizations like China. This is nothing else, because separation violates the two principles of "convenience" and "economy."</p>
<p>Since Mr. Zhu Jiahua became the minister, he realized that it was inappropriate to separate the wired and wireless telecommunications, so he first ordered the merger in May of last year. Also, because the merger of postal and telecommunications services is currently difficult to implement in practice, it is inevitable that the merger of postal and telecommunications services will be carried out first. Although these two things can be regarded as a matter of course, it is not surprising, but it is enough to see the delays of the past transportation authorities over the years.</p>
<p>However, there is still one thing that has not been done, which is the merger of reporting and talking. In the past two years, the domestic long-distance telephone business has developed very rapidly. The development of long-distance telephone business depends on the connection of local telephones, and the maintenance of long-distance telephone lines is most economical when combined with the maintenance of telegraph lines. For this reason, the merger of the telephone bureau and the telegraph bureau, so that telegrams and local and long-distance telephones are integrated, is the top priority today. The Ministry of Communications has taken this into account, and while working hard to build a long-distance telephone network in nine provinces, it first tried to merge the reporting and talking bureaus in Wuxian and Zhenjiang. Since the merger, not only has the reporting and talking communication been closely connected, but also significant achievements have been made in saving expenses. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has continued to order the telephone bureaus in Wuhu, Bengbu, Jiangdu, Jiujiang, Shashi, Zheng County, Luoyang, and Qingyuan (i.e., Baoding) to merge with the local telegraph bureaus. The name is temporarily called the "XX Telegraph Bureau," and an appropriate name will be changed after the full merger in the future. The telephone bureaus in Shanghai, Peiping, Tianjin, the capital, Wuhan, Qingdao, and Yantai have a larger scale and are not easy to merge at one time. They will be handled when appropriate houses are available and preparations are complete.</p>
<p>After the merger of reporting and talking, China's postal and telecommunications transportation agencies have a reasonable organization similar to those of the United Kingdom and Japan? The only difference is that the postal and telecommunications management departments have not yet merged, but the external business is the same as the post offices in the United Kingdom and Japan. This is indeed a major progress in China's postal and telecommunications undertakings in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="e222">A Notice to Telephone Users <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Hao</p>
<p>...There are seven points that should be noted...</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Ministry of Communications' General Rules for Local Telephone Business, the colleagues of this journal have successively written articles on the points related to the public, explaining them in detail. However, a detailed examination of the points described reveals that they are all indications of the benefits that the public should enjoy, while the obligations that the public should fulfill to the telephone bureau, as well as the various telephone service regulations that should be observed, have not been discussed much. The reporter is not talented, so he dares not to hesitate to choose the main points and explain them in the following, in order to awaken the attention of users:</p>
<p>A. Regarding the removal or dismantling of telephones: If a user wants to move the telephone installed to another place, or wants to remove all or part of the telephone equipment, he must notify the bureau in writing with his signature and seal seven days before the scheduled removal or dismantling, stating the requested sections. The notification should be sent by registered mail or by a special messenger to the bureau, and the bureau will send employees to handle it. If it is a machine moving, the user must clear all fees according to the price list in order to move the machine. If there are any outstanding fees, they must be paid in advance.</p>
<p>B. Regarding changing the name or transferring the account: If a user wants to change the name listed in the telephone directory, he should send the security deposit receipt to the bureau for additional registration. If he wants to transfer the telephone to another person, the new and old users should jointly send a letter to the telephone bureau, and send the security deposit receipt to the bureau for replacement. For the above two matters, if the user goes to the bureau to handle it, he does not need to pay a name change fee or a transfer fee. If the name or account is changed privately without notifying the telephone bureau, a name change fee of five yuan or a transfer fee of ten yuan should be paid once discovered.</p>
<p>C. Regarding the private installation of equipment: Users must not: (1) privately install any communication equipment on the telephone. (2) Privately install switchboards or mutual communication machines to the rented telephone line without reporting to the telephone bureau through proper procedures; (3) Or privately add extension machines to the small switchboard. If any violation is discovered, in addition to being handled according to law and temporarily suspending communication, all self-installed machine fees must be paid by the user in full before communication is restored. From then on, fees will be paid monthly according to the price of the installed equipment.</p>
<p>D. Regarding the elimination of violations: (1) Users must not use telephone equipment to communicate illegally or damage the state-owned telecommunications business. Otherwise, once discovered, the telephone will be stopped and the machine will be removed, and the right to rent the telephone will be permanently suspended. (2) Users must not move or exchange any telephone lines privately. Once discovered, in addition to being handled according to law, they will also be charged double the internal moving fee. (3) Except for those who undertake public telephones, users must not allow others to use the installed telephone and charge a fee. If they do so, the bureau will give a warning first; if they commit the offense again, they will be fined one month's rent. If they do not pay, the telephone will be stopped and the machine will be removed, and the right to rent the telephone will be permanently suspended. (4) When users request the installation of a telephone, if they hope to save money and falsely report the type; or change the type midway and conceal it, once discovered, the fee that should be paid will be charged double, but at most for twelve months.</p>
<p>E. Hoping that telephone users will cooperate: It is often found in various places that unscrupulous people, or employees who have been dismissed by the telephone bureau, often enter the homes of telephone users under false pretenses, or hold forged receipts and fraudulently collect telephone charges; or set up words for construction and secretly steal opportunities. All of these situations deeply affect the credibility of the telephone bureau and harm the safety of users. When the employees of the telephone bureau are sent out to collect fees or carry out construction work, they must wear badges. All of our telephone users, if employees of the telephone bureau come to collect fees or work in the future, please be sure to recognize the bureau's badges to identify the truth and avoid being deceived. If there are no badges, it is an impersonation, and you should refuse entry and notify the bureau immediately for investigation. In addition, the telephone bureau's staff and workers in various places have been strictly warned by the Ministry of Communications, and being kind and courteous is the only creed for external relations. If there is anyone who despises the orders and regulations, lacks courtesy to the outside world, or has a rude attitude, please notify the telephone bureau or send a letter to the Nanjing Ministry of Communications for punishment. Also, telephone bureau technicians go to each user's facility to install, remove, move, and repair telephone equipment, which are all their duties. It is strictly forbidden to demand wine money. If there is anyone who does not abide by the rules and demands money in violation of the regulations, please criticize them and notify the telephone bureau or send a letter to the Ministry of Communications for investigation.</p>
<p>The above five items are related to the safety of the public, the correctness of the exchange, the load of the telephone, or the income of the public family. They are closely related to the interests of both public and private parties. For example: private removal of the telephone can easily block the call, and if a little negligence is involved and the light wire is accidentally touched, the disaster will be unimaginable: private change of name or account is enough to disrupt the correctness of the exchange and cause accusations from other users; private addition of extension machines, switchboards or other communication equipment is enough to increase the load of the telephone and reduce the income of the telephone bureau; as for using telephone equipment to communicate illegally and harm the state-owned telecommunications business, it is even more intolerable by law. All of these are just a brief introduction to clarify the advantages and disadvantages. In short, to seek the perfection and satisfaction of local telephone communication, on the one hand, it depends on the telephone bureau's maintenance and properness, but on the other hand, the user's compliance with regulations and love for the sharp tools is also an indispensable condition. I hope that telephone users will pay attention to it!</p>

<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>Four manufacturers of Danish gramophone records sued the Danish National Wireless Radio Broadcasting Bureau in court for copyright infringement, claiming that the bureau broadcast their gramophone records without the manufacturers' permission. The reason is based on a provision of Danish law that "a person who can use mechanical methods to work has the same rights as the author." The court ruled as follows: The broadcasting bureau can still use gramophone records purchased before April 11, 1934, but cannot use those purchased after that date. The factory's claim for compensation and the request for a fine for the director of the broadcasting bureau were both rejected.</p>
<p>According to our country's broadcasting business, which is still in its infancy, there are no legal provisions for this right, and it cannot be cited. This has been explained by the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<h3 id="e224">National Radio Bureau Adopts Public Telegram Code <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>All telegrams sent by radio bureaus to contact each other for internal business or official matters are called "public telegrams." The nature of public telegrams is a document for business contact, so they are regarded as something that consumes rather than produces on the circuit. However, its content is mostly about inquiries and corrections about a certain electrical warfare, or about circuit dispatch and testing, and other official contacts, so its urgency is higher than ordinary telegrams. We therefore obtained two principles: that is, public telegrams should be reduced to the lowest degree in terms of quantity, so as not to hinder the speed of transmission of other reporting services. At the same time, in terms of quality, it should be extremely simple, so that processing and transmission can be very fast. Regarding the former, the Ministry of Communications has formulated various regulations restricting the sending of public telegrams to avoid the redundancy of public telegrams. Regarding the latter, the Ministry of Communications adopted the internationally used Marconi Public Telegram Code in June last year and printed and distributed it to more than 30 bureaus and stations in Nanjing for trial implementation. The trial results were excellent. Now the entire code of secret language has been translated into Chinese and printed and distributed to radio bureaus across the country for uniform implementation.</p>
<p>In the past, radio bureaus always used English abbreviations to send business public telegrams, and the words were still short, but no matter how much the abbreviations were omitted, each word could only represent the meaning of one word. Of course, the length of the telegram was still inevitable. The public telegram secret language now used replaces the meaning of a sentence or several sentences with an artificially put together word, so the number of words in the telegram must be greatly reduced, and the speed of transmission will naturally increase relatively. However, the alternative sentence of the secret language is fixed. When using it, of course, some occasions require adding clear language to express the meaning, so the Ministry of Communications specially collected many commonly used abbreviations for public telegrams and attached them to the back of the "Public Telegram Code" for the sending of public telegrams. At the same time, the previously stipulated method of writing the "index" of public telegrams, the public telegram procedure, the paid public telegram procedure, and other public telegram-related laws and regulations were also compiled and printed as an appendix to the "Public Telegram Code" for reference by personnel of each bureau.</p>
<p>We know that the capacity of the circuit has a certain limit. If it exceeds a certain limit, then it is necessary to increase the circuit or modify the high-speed machine, otherwise the circuit will be congested, and the reporting service will be delayed. It cannot maintain the original rate. In the past year, the Ministry of Communications has actively modified the high-speed machines of each busy circuit to expand the original capacity of the circuit. On the passive side, it strictly prohibits each bureau from sending public telegrams that are not urgent, thereby reducing the load on the circuit. This kind of non-urgent public telegram has always accounted for the largest number of all public telegrams. After the Ministry of Communications has thoroughly rectified it, it has almost disappeared now. This is the biggest improvement of the Ministry of Communications in terms of the quantity of public telegrams. Now that radio bureaus across the country have adopted the public telegram code, the quality of public telegrams is of course a step further, achieving the rationalization of simplicity and speed. From now on, the service performance of the radio bureau will definitely be more satisfactory to the senders and receivers!</p>
<h3 id="e225">A Brief Account of the Newly Revised General Regulations for Domestic Telegraph Operations <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Zhen</p>
<p>Currently, the procedures for receiving and sending telegrams at various telegraph offices are based on the regulations and rules established by the ministry in the past two years, as well as the "Telegraph Reception and Dispatch Measures" enacted eighteen years ago. However, the number of regulations and measures enacted repeatedly has reached several dozen, making it difficult for outsiders to understand them in detail. Even telegraph office receptionists and dispatchers find it challenging to memorize each one. Since the reception and dispatch of telegrams by telegraph offices involves contact with the public, it is necessary to have detailed and comprehensive regulations to define mutual relationships and ensure compliance by both parties. Recognizing this, the telecommunications authorities have specifically formulated a "General Regulations for Domestic Telegraph Operations" based on the "Telegraph Reception and Dispatch Rules" established in the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], the "Telegraph Reception and Dispatch Measures" established in the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], and the "New Regulations on Provincial Fees for Chinese Telegrams" promulgated and implemented in recent years, while also referencing the "International Telegraph Regulations." This has been printed as a separate booklet, along with a separately printed domestic telegraph rate table, and distributed to various telegraph offices, with instructions to implement it from September 1st of this year. This booklet is available for free perusal at various telegraph offices and telegraph reception and dispatch locations within post offices.</p>
<p>Since the General Regulations for Domestic Telegraph Operations is compiled based on the aforementioned various measures and regulations, its content integrates all existing measures and regulations concerning telegraph reception and dispatch into a systematic set of rules. This allows the public to send telegrams according to the various provisions in the new regulations, and telegraph office receptionists and dispatchers can also use the new regulations as a standard for accepting telegrams. In the future, with a common set of regulations to be followed by both senders and receivers and telegraph office receptionists and dispatchers, all unnecessary disputes can be avoided. While the new regulations largely follow the previous regulations in their compilation, there are still many revisions compared to the previous version. A summary of the key changes is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding telegraphic writing: (A) According to previous practice, for private Chinese telegrams translated by the sender, it was only necessary to write the code on the outgoing telegram form and submit it to the telegraph office for transmission. Now, the new regulations stipulate that for Chinese telegrams, in addition to the place name of the receiving location, the sender should translate and annotate the code for each written character (private Chinese telegrams must not only contain the code without text) so that the receiving and dispatching staff can hand it over to the decoding staff for verification of errors. However, those who wish to have the telegraph office translate Chinese telegrams can have the telegraph office translate and annotate the code. (B) The new regulations stipulate that telephone numbers and postal box numbers used in place of Chinese telegram addresses must be written in parentheses. For example: (1) Nanjing Tel (31131) Wang Liang, (2) Qingdao Post Office Box (275) Huang Yongfu. Regarding the writing format for phone-transmitted Chinese telegrams, the new regulations stipulate the following: TF Nanjing (31131) Wang Liang. The above writing format provisions are slightly different from the previous ones. (C) Regarding the method of writing code numbers and Arabic numerals indicating the date and number of the telegram in Chinese banking telegrams, the new regulations stipulate that they must be written in parentheses and followed by the character "hao" [號, meaning number]. However, if there are no other characters or numbers in between, only one "hao" character needs to be added after the second parenthesis. For example: (9717) (1601) hao. Therefore, it is more economical to write these code number pairs and Arabic numerals indicating the date and number of the telegram consecutively, as it saves the fee for one "hao" character. (D) The new regulations stipulate that a small number of foreign letters or phrases, punctuation marks, parentheses, fractional slashes, and commercial symbols can also be used in the address and text of Chinese telegrams. This provision was not available in the old regulations, and it provides many conveniences for senders. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e226">Measures for Telegraph Service Communication Inspection <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Liang</p>
<p>Another New Initiative for Streamlining Telecommunications Administration</p>
<p>Since the establishment of business inspectors in telegraph offices in major trading ports, significant achievements have been made and the public has responded favorably. The telegraph service has developed as a result. However, the establishment of business inspectors is limited to a small number of telegraph offices in major trading ports, and the scope is not broad. The authorities originally planned to assign more inspectors to conduct general inspections of telegraph offices in various locations, but this has not been possible due to limitations in manpower and financial resources. Even in the offices where inspectors have been established, the small number of personnel still makes it difficult to avoid incomplete inspections. Therefore, a method of telegraph service communication inspection has been specifically formulated to remedy this. The method involves using postcards printed with two types of inspection forms, A and B, listing all inquiries. Telegraph offices and the Telecommunications Department will send these to senders and receivers for completion and return. The responsible personnel of each agency will review them. If any delays, errors, or other non-conformities are found, the personnel involved will be given appropriate punishment depending on the severity of the circumstances. Type A inspection forms are for telegrams received by the recipient from others, and Type B inspection forms are for telegrams sent by the sender to others. (These inspection forms are available at the Telecommunications Department and various offices; requests will be sent immediately.)</p>
<p>The department has issued a circular to all telegraph offices to implement these measures from today. Telegraph offices with more than one thousand incoming and outgoing telegrams per month should complete and send out inspection forms fifty times per month; those with more than five thousand should complete and send out one hundred and twenty-five times; those with more than ten thousand should complete and send out two hundred and fifty times; and those with more than thirty thousand should complete and send out five hundred times. In addition to each office completing and sending out forms according to the above regulations, the Telecommunications Department will also conduct random checks at any time to ensure thoroughness. For offices with less than one thousand incoming and outgoing telegrams per month, the communication inspection work will be handled directly by the Telecommunications Department. After these measures are implemented, the scope of telegraph service inspection will be expanded. On the one hand, it will make telegraph office personnel more cautious in their work. On the other hand, the telecommunications authorities will be able to understand the performance of telegraph offices in various locations, as well as the public's views on the telegraph offices, for reference and improvement. However, this matter cannot be achieved by unilateral efforts alone, and it is hoped that senders and receivers in all sectors will provide assistance to ensure smooth progress and achieve cooperative results. The following are some important points regarding the completion and return of inspection forms, which we urge people from all walks of life to pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) After receiving the inspection form, please complete and return it in detail as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(2) Please complete all items listed in the inspection form, except for those marked "To be completed by the Department" or "To be completed by the Office."</p>
<p>(3) When completing the form, please verify that the telegram being completed matches the number and date indicated by the Telecommunications Department or the Telegraph Office.</p>
<p>(4) If there are any errors in the text, please indicate which word is incorrect. Also, if the delivery person demands a tip for drinks or if there is a fee for translation of the incoming telegram, please indicate the amount of money given for investigation.</p>
<p>(5) If senders and receivers have any opinions or dissatisfaction with the telegraph office's operations and all measures, they can explain them frankly and without reservation in the form for the telecommunications authorities to improve.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Several Things to Know Before Sending a Telegram <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— De Jiu</p>
<p>——A Word to Telegram Senders——</p>
<p>Everyone who reads the newspaper every day knows about the merger of the Ministry of Communications with the Radio Administration. But perhaps the average telegram sender is still quite unfamiliar with how wired and wireless communications are connected, and how they function?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, because the Ministry of Communications Building has not yet been built, the wired and wireless telegraph offices are still located separately. It is common for telegram senders to mistakenly believe that telegrams sent from the General Receiving and Dispatching Office on Fourth Malu [now East Fuzhou Road] are definitely wired telegrams, while telegrams sent from the Receiving and Dispatching Office on Minguo Road [now East Yan'an Road] are definitely wireless telegrams. This is incorrect. Whether it is the General Receiving and Dispatching Office, the branch offices, or the post office receiving stations, all of them accept both wired and wireless domestic and international telegrams. So you can go to the former wireless telegraph station to send wired telegrams, and vice versa, you can also go to the former General Telegraph Office to send wireless telegrams.</p>
<p>Since the merger of wired and wireless communications, the speed of telegrams has increased considerably, further demonstrating the complementary function of wired and wireless communications. When a telegraph office receives a telegram, it immediately sends it out on the fastest circuit. For example, if a place has both wired and wireless facilities, the telegram will be sent on whichever circuit is faster. Therefore, senders do not need to specify whether to use wired or wireless transmission.</p>
<p>Telegram senders, of course, cannot know for sure the transmission speed and smoothness of a particular circuit. Sometimes there are line obstructions in wired communications, and sometimes there is interference in wireless communications, which telegram senders cannot imagine. Therefore, for the benefit of telegram senders, it is best not to specify the circuit, and let the telegraph office decide. The telegraph office will be able to provide a fast and reliable guarantee.</p>
<p>For example, for telegrams sent from Shanghai to Nanjing, Yantai, and Qingdao, there were originally both wired and wireless circuits, but recently, due to the fast and smooth operation of the wired circuits, the wireless circuits have been cancelled. Sometimes telegram senders insist on writing "Send by wireless" on their telegrams. This makes it very difficult for the receiving staff. If they were to accept it and send it to the wireless telegraph office, the wireless telegraph office would still have to send it to the wired telegraph office for transmission, which would not only be more troublesome, but also take up a lot of time. Sometimes, when stubborn telegram senders are encountered, they will not believe you and rush to the Receiving and Dispatching Office on Minguo Road to send the telegram, thinking that sending it from the former wireless telegraph station would definitely be wireless. Little do they know that the result will still be that the telegram is transferred from the wireless telegraph office to the wired telegraph office for transmission.</p>
<p>Conversely, sometimes wireless communications have direct circuits, while wired communications have to go through several offices for transmission, so it is of course better to send wireless telegrams. However, telegram senders insist on sending wired telegrams, which delays the time. Isn't this unfair?</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new provincial fee regulations, it has been much more convenient for telegram senders. The address and name of fifteen characters only costs the price of five characters. In this way, telegram senders can write the address and name very clearly. The problem of telegrams not being delivered due to the omission of characters to save money in the past can be avoided. But now there are also some minor problems. Sometimes, because the number of characters in the address is too many, exceeding fifteen characters, the characters are omitted. Some even omit the surname altogether. This can easily lead to errors in delivery. In Shanghai, three or four, seven or eight, or even ten or twenty families live in one house. How can the delivery person deliver the telegram? Some write the location in a redundant way, which is not only time-consuming and resource-intensive during transmission, but also easily leads to mistakes. For example, to send a telegram to "Wang Cheng, No. 2 Jiankang Road, Nanjing," it can definitely be delivered if written as above. However, because the sender thinks that writing a few more characters costs the same price, they add the six characters "Yangzimiao Qiwang Street" to become "Wang Cheng, No. 2 Qiwang Street, Yangzimiao, Jiankang Road, Nanjing." The sender thinks that the more detailed the location, the better, but the receiving office is bound to make mistakes when delivering the telegram. The new provincial fee regulations charge five characters for fifteen characters for the address and name, not to say that the sender must make up fifteen characters! As long as the address is clear, there is no need to be redundant!</p>
<p>Finally, to summarize some key points for telegram senders:</p>
<p>(1) No matter where a domestic telegram is sent, and no matter where it is sent from, it is not necessary to indicate "Send by wired" or "Send by wireless." After the telegraph office receives the telegram, it will immediately send it out on the fastest circuit.</p>
<p>(2) For international telegrams, please indicate "Via Cgra" to ensure the fastest and most accurate results.</p>
<p>(3) The address and name should be clear, and it is unnecessary to be redundant, which can easily lead to errors.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Recent Developments in World Telecommunications Technology (Continued) <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Dachun</p>
<p>To reiterate wireless communication, the application of ultra-short waves and the ability to transmit wide bandwidth frequencies in wireless communication are progressing every year. New mechanical equipment has been used in the United Kingdom and France to conduct cross-Channel tests using a single-channel ultra-short wave commercial radio-optical machine (Micro-Ray) with a frequency of 1,700 megahertz (wavelength approximately equal to two and a half meters), which achieved satisfactory results. Furthermore, tests were conducted on nine wireless telephone circuits using 100 megahertz, also with good results. The latter can be regarded as a precursor to the future development of multi-channel commercial wireless telephones.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Bristol Channel in the United Kingdom, ultra-short wave wireless telephones are currently installed in the landline telephone network to provide wired and wireless telephone connections. In Guernsey and Shaftesbury, Germany—a distance of 110 miles—there is also a communication circuit using a wavelength of 5 meters. The practicality of this type of shortwave radio makes the effectiveness of ordinary wireless radio gradually weaken. Therefore, the trend in landline telephones in various countries is to add shortwave wireless telephones at both ends to increase communication efficiency.</p>
<p>Regarding the wireless equipment of aircraft, the recent trend in various countries is to equip aircraft with automatic receiving and transmitting machinery. The use of wireless machines to guide aircraft to land blindly in heavy fog has been widely adopted by aviation stations in various countries, such as Tempelhof in Germany and Zurich in Switzerland. The Automatic Direction Finder has now been invented and was on display at the International Aviation Exhibition held in Paris last November. On land, this type of direction finder can more accurately correct errors in aircraft night flights, and is superior to other types of machines. Furthermore, a type of aviation wireless radio that uses short antennas, high-frequency transformers (R.F. Transformer), and lead-covered high-frequency transmission lines (Lead Covered R.F. Transmission Lines) has also been invented. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e230">Helmet and Headgear Industry <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Xiao Yueying</p>
<p>The helmet and headgear industry has been most affected by the decline of Peking Opera in recent years. Among the costumes in Peking Opera troupes, helmets and headgear account for an important part, and their variety is even greater than that of stage costumes. According to people in the helmet and headgear making industry, there are about a thousand different kinds of helmets and headgear in total, and if detailed items and various parts are combined, there are as many as three thousand kinds.</p>
<p>The heyday of the helmet and headgear industry was during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the value of a full set of helmets and headgear was at least five hundred yuan, and it was not uncommon for the value to reach hundreds of thousands of taels of silver. Therefore, almost every helmet and headgear workshop at that time made a profit of three times its investment. However, "good dreams are easy to wake up" seems to have become an unchanging rule. Now, Peking Opera has been abandoned by the times, and the helmet and headgear industry has also entered a gray situation. In Beijing, the number of helmet and headgear workshops has gradually decreased from more than forty to only more than ten. Because the center of Peking Opera has shifted to Shanghai, these more than ten helmet and headgear workshops have become increasingly unsustainable. When the helmet and headgear workshops in Beijing were in a slump, it was the beginning of the development of the helmet and headgear workshops in Shanghai. After the end of the Qing Dynasty, famous actors from the old capital flocked to the south to perform, and all the costumes needed for the plays were made nearby in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The earliest helmet and headgear workshop in Shanghai was Cijin Ban. However, at that time, there were only two or three workshops specializing in making helmets and headgear for opera troupes. Most of the other workshops regarded helmet and headgear making as a sideline. Later, due to the development of the stage business in Shanghai, the actual demand gradually expanded, and those who previously only made facial hair and lamps all changed to specializing in making helmets and headgear. As a result, the number of helmet and headgear workshops in Shanghai increased from two or three to sixteen or seventeen, and the people in the helmet and headgear industry were divided into two groups, Tianjin and Jiangsu. In addition to making helmets and headgear, most of these two groups of helmet and headgear workshops also made costumes and various parts. They each had their own specialties. The Tianjin group was known for its expertise in making "helmet liners," while the Jiangsu group was famous for its embroidery skills. Recently, the most famous helmet and headgear workshops include more than ten shops such as Liu Hengchang. The few shops in the City God Temple are less known because of their location. According to surveys, these more than ten helmet and headgear workshops can make the following kinds of complete helmets and soft scarf parts: Da Guo Qiao [large arched bridge], Xiao Guo Qiao [small arched bridge], Nü Tao Qiao [female upturned set], Jin Lian Hua Guan [golden lotus crown], Yin Lian Hua Guan [silver lotus crown], Jin Yin Wan Zi Kui [gold and silver marquis helmet], Huang Bai Huo Long Guan [yellow and white fire dragon crown], Gui Tou E Zi [ghost head ornament], Nü Huo Yan [female flame], Ping Ding Guan [flat top crown], Zha Jin Huo Yan [turban flame], Zha Jin Jin Yin Tao Qiao [turban gold and silver upturned set], Jin Yin Zhong Xin Sha Tao Qiao [gold and silver center gauze upturned set], Jin Yin Yu Qiao Zhao [gold and silver fish upturned set cover], He Ye Pian Xue Shi Kui [lotus leaf fragment scholar helmet], Zhong Xin Sha Mao [center gauze hat], Zhong Xin Sha Cui Qiao [center gauze kingfisher upturned set], Yuan Sha Mao [round gauze hat], Jin Jue Qiao [golden sparrow upturned set], Sha Xi Pian [tin fragments], Zao Li Mao [runner hat], Shu Li Mao [clerk hat], Cui Ya Pian Jin [kingfisher duck fragment scarf], Hua Ci Gu Qi [flower porcelain old woman discarded], Wu Fo Guan [five Buddha crown], Guan Yin Dou [Guanyin hood], Jin Yin Ya Dan Guan [gold and silver duck egg crown], Tu Di Lian Zi [earth god face], Jia Guan Lian Zi [official adding face], Lei Gong Lian Zi [thunder god face], Lan Shu Zhuang [lazy dressing], Ji Zu Fa [ancestor remembrance hair], Lü Shen Mao [green god hat], Shou Xing Guan [longevity star crown], Ba Jie Zui [Pigsy mouth], Xi Shen [god of happiness], Hei Xiao Lao Ye Mao [black young master hat], Jin Yin He Ye Kui [gold and silver lotus leaf helmet], Jin Yin Er Lang Kui [gold and silver Erlang helmet], Ba Mian Wei [eight-sided majesty], Shi Zi Kui [lion helmet], Hei Bai Huang Hu Tou Kui [black white yellow tiger head helmet], Lao Dan Feng [old female phoenix], Jin Yin Du Si E [gold and silver commander forehead]. The above are detailed names of parts of helmets, hats, and crowns. In addition, there are many other strange names of helmets and crowns, which even helmet makers cannot say without a blueprint. In terms of the value of these helmets and headgear, some are worth one or two yuan, while others are worth more than one hundred yuan. The best helmets and headgear, in addition to the exquisite appearance and workmanship, also require the "helmet liners" to be resistant to cracking and discoloration. "Helmet liners" are mostly made of "cold cloth," but this type of "liner" is prone to collapse and break. Therefore, most of the higher-value helmets use copper to make the "liners," which are not easy to break and do not change color. These types of helmets cost at least thirty to fifty yuan to make.</p>
<p>The capital required to open a helmet and headgear workshop is said to be uncertain. Three to five hundred yuan is a helmet and headgear workshop, and several thousand yuan is also a helmet and headgear workshop. Although there is so much disparity in the amount of capital, it is not easy to distinguish who has more capital in terms of appearance or substance. This is also where the helmet and headgear industry is more mysterious than other industries. The daily sales of a helmet and headgear workshop are generally easy to calculate. In addition to the daily necessities of rent, food, and electricity, which are the same as other stores, the labor costs are calculated according to the goods, and the boss does not have to bear the wages during idle times. Ordinary helmet and headgear workshops require about three to five to more than ten workers, with a maximum of no more than twenty people. They each have their own specialties and cooperate with each other. Generally speaking, it takes about five or six people to make a helmet, with exceptions for particularly simple and troublesome ones. Their skills can be divided into making "liners," "belts," "inserting materials," "making tassels," and "making hat boxes." For particularly troublesome "helmets," none of these types of workers can be missing. Conversely, for particularly simple "helmets," even just one person can complete the work.</p>
<p>The quality of life of a helmet maker depends entirely on the level of his skill. According to common practice, in addition to providing meals, the boss's treatment of them is to stipulate wages according to the type of skill. Generally speaking, regardless of the type of worker, the highest monthly income will not exceed twenty yuan, and the lowest is only seven or eight yuan. However, the boss's basis for making money is mostly</p>

<p>based on the "half-teacher, half-apprentice" apprentices. The apprenticeship period for helmet and headgear making is usually one year longer than that of ordinary stores. During this period, the apprentice not only does not receive a stipend, but also has to bring a fee to pay his master when entering the store. However, due to the decline of the helmet and headgear industry in recent years, the number of people learning this craft has also decreased a lot, and the bosses have canceled this apprenticeship fee.</p>

<p>In recent years, the women's movement in China seems to have declined; there don't seem to be many publications that specifically discuss women's issues. Therefore, some people say that the days when "women" were in the limelight have passed along with the "May Fourth" and "May Thirtieth" eras. However, later, due to the inspiration of the great era, those women's issues that were almost unnoticed have finally been brought up again, one by one, in today's discussions. It is in this situation that I have noticed many women's publications in the publishing world: "Women's Resonance," "Women's Youth Semi-Monthly," "Women's Monthly," "Women's Voice," and "Women's Life." However, among these women's publications, their respective target audiences are also very different. For example, "Women's Resonance" and others are reading materials for mothers-in-law, grandmothers, and great-grandmothers, while "Women's Voice" is aimed at young men and women who are serious about life. Therefore, their content is also essentially different.</p>
<p>Now, what I want to introduce to the readers is the recent issues of "Women's Voice."</p>
<p>First of all, I feel that "Women's Voice" is very capable of paying attention to all social phenomena related to women's issues, and it can also give correct judgments in a timely manner. For example, Bigu's "Banning Co-education" in the thirteenth issue is speaking out against the Beijing authorities' ban on co-education; Luo Qiong's "Escaping the Cage of 'Relief'" in the fourteenth issue "exposes the hypocrisy of 'Women's Relief Homes' and other false 'charities' based on realistic facts"; Yi Wei's "From 'Selling' and 'Renting' to 'Open Mate Selection'" in the sixteenth issue, regarding the incident of women in Dangtu being picked and sold along the way in baskets, the practice of local thugs in Guizhou renting out women, and the phenomenon of charitable organizations holding open mate selection for young girls, all gave appropriate judgments. Because "Women's Voice" can seize these real-world issues in a timely manner for discussion, its content is very vibrant.</p>
<p>"Women's Voice" pays close attention to political and economic issues and sometimes publishes academic theoretical texts. Regarding the former, there are Xiang Yun's "German Rearmament and the European Situation" (Issue 13), Shi Yun's "China's Financial Panic" (Issue 14), "The Turmoil of the French Political Situation" (Issue 15), and "The Franco-German Naval Agreement" (Issue 16); regarding the latter, there is Xiuqun's "Understanding and Action" (Philosophical Discourse) in the thirteenth issue. These texts are written in a popular form, so even those who do not have in-depth research on political and economic issues, even those who do not have profound philosophical knowledge, can understand their content after reading these texts. At the same time, I also want to say that "Women's Voice"'s ability to publish articles on political economy and academic theory is also one of its characteristics. Some domestic women's publications often hold the prejudice that women do not care about political and economic issues or study academics, and they do not publish such articles; if someone asks the editors of these publications why this is the case, they will all say that it is because general female readers do not read such articles. In fact, this expression is a development of the old concept that "a woman without talent is virtuous." May I ask why women should not have knowledge of international and domestic politics and economics? Why shouldn't they study academics and acquire necessary knowledge? If people do not agree with the theory that "a woman without talent is virtuous," then that kind of article should be published in general women's publications; even if it cannot be welcomed by general female readers at the beginning of publication, the editors and authors of those materials should take responsibility and try to guide them to read that kind of article, so that they can acquire useful knowledge about politics, economics, and various academics.</p>
<p>As for shortcomings, "Women's Voice" also has them. Such as the lack of vitality in soft articles on women's life and local communications, the lack of descriptive power, being not vivid, and not lively; such as the unclear central idea of ​​some articles criticizing other people's opinions, the lack of fighting power, the lack of boldness and positive spirit; such as the ordinariness of the cover; these are the main shortcomings of "Women's Voice." Some people say that "Women's Voice" loves to criticize people too much, and even say that it loves to scold people too much, but in my opinion, "Women's Voice" is still too polite in criticizing people, thus reducing its positive spirit. I think that for small publications like "Women's Voice," those who should be criticized should be criticized mercilessly, and those who should be "scolded" should also be "scolded" without hesitation, because only in this way can the faces of truth and fallacy be more clearly displayed, and can the mood of general readers be more powerfully stimulated, and "Women's Voice" can show its strength even more!</p>
<p>Celebrity Interview</p>
<h3 id="e232">Interview with Go Master Gu Shuiru <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jianxin</p>
<p>Go is one of the ancient arts of our country. The era of its origin is untraceable, but according to general legend, it began in the era of Emperor Yao. In that case, its history is more than three thousand years. In the early Tang Dynasty, a certain Japanese prince admired the name of Gu Shiyan, a Chinese Go master, crossed the sea to learn, and Go was passed to Japan. As of today, it has become better than the original.</p>
<p>Go was vigorously promoted in the early Qing Dynasty, so many masters emerged at that time. It can be said to be the golden age of Go. The masters Shi Xiangxia, Fan Xiping, Cheng Lanru, and Liang Weijin were known as the Four Heroes. During the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, masters Guo Boling, Sheng Dayou, Huang Longshi, Zhou Lanyu, and Xu Xingyou were all famous for Go, and Huang Longshi was especially regarded as outstanding. Since the Republic of China, due to the lack of promotion, the research of Go has gradually declined, and the number of Go masters has also gradually decreased. Now, I am afraid that only Mr. Gu Shuiru can be regarded as one of the outstanding ones.</p>
<p>It is said that the Shanghai Go Club is managed by Mr. Gu. Because the Go Club is next to my home, I took the opportunity to visit it one afternoon.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Go Club is a two-story building. Its west wing is the place to play Go. When I walked there, there were several pairs playing there. The weather was so hot that although there was an electric fan constantly blowing in the room, it was still as hot as putting a duck in a steamer. Some of them were bare-chested, and some were wearing only a vest. Although the sweat on their foreheads was dripping, they didn't care at all. They were all focused on the Go board, placing black and white pieces one by one. Time passed quickly. Although three or four hours had passed, they were still playing. Each time they moved a piece, they had to think for a long time before moving their hands. Therefore, a game of Go often took two or three days to finish.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Shuiru is a man in his forties. He looks like Mr. Xu Shiying, but his cheeks are wider than Mr. Xu's. When I went upstairs, he was humming Kunqu Opera, which was quite interesting. After he finished humming Kunqu Opera, he slowly opened the conversation box.</p>
<p>"It seems to be a bit cooler these days." It was the Fengjing accent.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "Are you busy these days?"</p>
<p>"I have nothing to do, just playing Go every day." He smiled.</p>
<p>"The Japanese distinguish the level of Go masters into several dans. Then, how many people in China are qualified to reach the dan level?"</p>
<p>"There are many, now there are several Go masters like Liu Dihuai, Zhang Danru, Wei Haihong, Lei Puhua, etc., and the most outstanding is the child prodigy Wu Qingyuan."</p>
<p>"Have you played with all these people?"</p>
<p>"I have only not played against Zhang Danru, but I have played against all the others. Liu Dihuai, Wei Haihong, Lei Puwan, etc., they always have to let me have two or three pieces to be able to draw. Their skills can be called three dan in Japan. Wu Qingyuan is my godson." When he said this, he showed a proud look on his face, and continued, "He has had the talent to play Go since he was a child. His father was a judge of the former Beijing Higher Court, and his maternal grandfather, Zhang Yuanqi, was the governor of Fengtian Province. Because they can all play Go, he has had an environment to learn Go since he was a child. However, he died early, and when he was ten years old, he was sent to me through a friend's introduction. At that time, his small body always stood on a stool when playing Go with me. I always let him have five pieces when playing Go with him. He studied so hard every day that when he was eleven years old, he could draw with Liu Dihuai, Lei Puhua, etc. Such a genius is rare after all. Later, in order to learn skills, he was introduced to the Japanese capitalist Okura Kihachiro by a consul of the Japanese Embassy three or four years ago, and then joined the Japanese Go Institute through Okura's introduction. His level was three dan when he first entered, and now he has been promoted to six dan, but his real ability is probably above six dan or two."</p>
<p>"Go has a history of three thousand years in our country. Why has it been declining in recent years?"</p>
<p>"I never believe that Chinese people are inferior to people of other countries, or that people today are inferior to people of ancient times, because the abilities of ancient people and people of other countries are recorded in the Go scores. We only need to follow them to study and we can get all the abilities. We have our abilities, and if we study further, then people today will be better than people of ancient times, and Chinese people will be better than people of other countries. After Go was introduced to Japan from the early Tang Dynasty, Japanese soldiers thought that Go implied military science, and that its advance and retreat were like warfare, so soldiers were able to study it carefully, and the government authorities were able to promote it greatly. The basic fund of the Japanese Go Institute has now reached 20 million gold. When the Go Institute was founded, Okura Kihachiro helped with a fund of 500,000 yuan, which is enough to see the enthusiasm of the Japanese for protecting Go. Because improper entertainment is prohibited in Japan, leisure is often spent playing Go, so it is known to every household, and about six or seven tenths of the Japanese people can play Go.</p>
<p>"Japanese newspapers all have special Go publications. They often invite six dan and seven dan masters to play against each other in their newspaper offices. Their salary is calculated by the game. Six dan is 60 yuan, and seven dan is 70 yuan. Each game often lasts eight to twelve hours, and only four hours are played each day, so the outcome of a game is often between two and three days. After the game, they also invite the nine dan master Honinbo Shusai to comment, and his commentary fee is 100 yuan, so the cost of a Go game in the Japanese newspaper is about 300 yuan. The situation of the game is also published in the newspaper daily. The salary of the nine dan master Honinbo Shusai in the Japanese Go Institute is 3,000 yuan per month, and the income from commentary is not included.</p>
<p>"When I was in Tianjin before, there was a Shangbao newspaper there. Because the editor-in-chief was our friend, I opened a Go column for them, specializing in commenting on the game situation. The sales of Shangbao immediately increased by more than 1,000 copies. At that time, I once counted the hometowns of the subscribers. As a result, people from Zhejiang and Tianjin were the most, followed by Hunan and Hubei. Only a few were from inland areas such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. The Xinye Daily in this city now also has a Go column, which is compiled by members of our club. They have also asked me to comment for them. I didn't agree because commenting is a very troublesome and most mentally exhausting thing, and it is not as easy as annotating articles."</p>
<p>"Then, who can be regarded as the most skilled in the Chinese Go world? At the same time, how does it compare with Japan?" I further asked.</p>
<p>"This," he smiled and shook his head, then took a puff of smoke and said, "In the Chinese Go world, I have played against all the masters, and I have never lost once except to Wu Qingyuan. Perhaps, there are still masters among the recluses, but I have never heard of them. In Japan, I have also played against six dan and seven dan masters, and I have also won more times than lost. However, they say that I am only at the five dan level. If we compare with them, I think we may not be as good as them at present?"</p>
<p>At this time, his wife kindly opened a cantaloupe, so we chewed it together and ended this conversation.</p>

<h3 id="e233">The World's Gold <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongke</p>
<p>Gold has always been a precious metal. Long ago, those ancient civilizations used gold to make decorations and utensils. Now we can still see ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, and Chinese gold products. Aren't many of the antiquities we have excavated made of gold? This shows that human use of gold and cherishing of gold has been the case since ancient times.</p>
<p>However, the large-scale excavation of gold buried in various parts of the world is a matter of modern times. In the middle of the previous century, the total amount of gold produced in the world in a year was only 10 million to 30 million yuan. It was not until the discovery of gold in California in 1848 and the discovery of gold in eastern Australia in 1851 that the world's gold production was greatly increased. By 1853, the world's gold production had exceeded 150 million yuan.</p>
<p>However, the gold produced at this time was mainly placer gold. After a period of time, this placer gold was gradually exhausted. By the 1870s, the production had dropped to 10 million yuan. After the invention of the new refining method in 1886, gold production gradually increased again; especially due to the discovery of gold production in South Africa in 1885, gold production began to leap forward. In 1899, world gold production exceeded 310 million, and by 1910, it had created a record of 450 million. As for the ups and downs of the figures in recent years, they have also been hovering around 400 million yuan.</p>
<p>Half of these gold productions are mainly produced in southern Africa; the other half is produced in Asia, America, and other places, mainly from countries surrounding the Pacific Ocean. According to recent surveys, the gold production of various countries in the world is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Hundred Million Ten Thousand Yuan ％</p>
<p>Union of South Africa 2.2160 53.3</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>Rhodesia 1131 2.7</p>
<p>Other African regions 999 2.4</p>
<p>Canada 4356 10.5</p>
<p>United States 4245 10.2</p>
<p>Mexico 1383 3.3</p>
<p>South America 950 2.2</p>
<p>Central America 100 0.3</p>
<p>Russia 2100 5.0</p>
<p>Australia 1043 2.5</p>
<p>New Zealand 291 0.7</p>
<p>Japan 985 2.4</p>
<p>British India 680 1.4</p>
<p>Philippines 370 0.9</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies 220 0.5</p>
<p>China 200 0.5</p>
<p>Europe 350 0.9</p>
<p>Total 4.15.64 100.0</p>
<p>According to the above table, 59.4% of the total is produced by Africa, 25.5% is produced by North America, 15% is produced by Russia, Siberia, and Asia, and the rest is produced by Europe, Australia, South America, and other places. Among these, the Union of South Africa, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and western Africa are all British colonies, so Britain exclusively accounts for 73% of the world's gold production, with an annual production of more than 300 million yuan. The second is the United States and the Philippines, with an annual production of 46.15 million yuan, accounting for 11.% of the world's gold production. The next is Russia and Mexico, etc.</p>
<p>The production of British-owned gold-producing areas is now increasing. The Transvaal of the Union of South Africa accounts for more than half of the world's gold production and still maintains a trend of development. As for Canada, its development trend is even more surprising. At the end of the previous century, after the discovery of placer gold in the Yukon bordering Alaska, Canada's gold production had occupied the third place in the world; when many gold mines were discovered in the Archean strata of Ontario, its annual production quickly reached 43.4 million yuan, surpassing the United States and ranking second in the world. At the same time, most of Canada is still an uninhabited virgin land, and there are many opportunities for the discovery of new gold mines, so its future is limitless. In addition, the gold production in India, New Zealand, and other places, although it has not attracted much attention, is also very promising.</p>
<p>In the middle of the previous century, the United States' gold production had the highest honor. But since the emergence of the Transvaal Great Gold Mountain, it has not been able to maintain its highest position. In terms of production, the United States produced 99.67 million yuan in 1909, which can be said to be the highest record of gold production, but it has gradually declined since then. By 1932, although the total gold production of the United States was still 46 million yuan, 3.7 million yuan of which was produced by the Philippine Islands, and 8.16 million yuan was produced by Alaska. Only 34 million yuan was produced by the United States itself. From this, the declining trend of gold production in the United States can be seen.</p>
<p>To the south of the gold-producing area in the western United States is the gold-producing area of ​​Mexico. The gold produced here is mainly obtained from gold and silver mines. In terms of silver, its annual production is more than 100 million ounces, accounting for 40% of the world's gold production, ranking first; as for gold production, it reaches 14 million yuan per year, ranking fifth in the world. As for its future development, it cannot be predicted now.</p>
<p>Russia's gold production has also increased in recent years, and its annual production has been more than 20 million yuan, ranking fourth in the world. Moreover, most of the gold produced now is placer gold in Siberia. In addition, there are rich gold mines buried in those sparsely populated areas, which have not been developed until now, and it is still unknown how much the output is. So we can conclude that the future of Russian gold production is even brighter.</p>
<p>As for Europe, except for Russia, there is little gold production in other places. Even Romania, which occupies the Transvaal gold mine area, has an annual production of less than 3.5 million yuan. In addition, such as Britain, which exclusively accounts for 73% of the world's gold production, its domestic gold production is only 350 yuan per year, which is not as much as the annual income of a European or American worker.</p>
<p>The gold-producing areas and the countries that occupy these gold-producing areas have been described above. But now the country with the most gold is not the country that occupies the main gold-producing areas. In fact, although Britain exclusively accounts for 73% of the world's gold production, it is not the largest storage of gold; the United States is now the country with the most gold in the world, followed by France.</p>
<p>However, although the United States and France have large amounts of gold, there are many unemployed and impoverished people among their people, and there are also many people who try to rob those golds. Therefore, the gold in Paris, New York, and other places is protected by solid and perfect engineering in peacetime! Once gold is transported, police, escorts, detectives, telephone detectives, etc. must be mobilized together, and the situation is more serious than protecting important people during the most serious period. However, unexpectedly, gold robbery still happens in New York and other places. This shows that gold is too expensive and too useful in today's world, so even under the muzzle of a gun, some people dare to risk robbing it.</p>

<h3 id="e234">My Sister's Marriage <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shuxun</p>
<p>My older sister is about to "leave the pavilion" (get married). Her dowry was prepared three months ago. My father, very pleased with himself, stroked his beard with one hand and pointed to the trousseau with the other, saying to my sister, "Xiang'er, do you see anything wrong with these things? Which family would be as willing to spend like I am when marrying off their daughter? You must live up to expectations!"</p>
<p>My sister gently lowered her head, her ears turning red. In fact, it wasn't just my father bragging; the neighbors were also full of praise:</p>
<p>"Second Master is really generous in sending off his eldest daughter this time! Just the dowry alone is worth over a thousand silver dollars—more than a dozen fine pieces of clothing, and even gold jewelry!"</p>
<p>"That's right! Only his family can afford it. I hear the groom's family is also very wealthy."</p>
<p>"Who says otherwise? The famous Zhang family. But—I hear the groom is a bit disabled, it's a pity for such a talented and beautiful girl..."</p>
<p>"What can you do? They were betrothed in the womb!"</p>
<p>Even with such a lavish dowry, my sister still wasn't happy; she always had a worried look on her face, lying on the bed and sighing softly. Sometimes she would pick up that book called "Heartbreak Lyrics" and slowly read it, but soon her eyes would become red, and eventually tears would fall! Every time I saw this, I would ask her consolingly, "Sister Xiang, why are you crying again?"</p>
<p>"I'm not crying!" she would say, wiping her eyes and defending herself, "Be a good boy and don't tell Mom!"</p>
<p>Then she would gently hold me in her arms, speaking in the most loving tone: "Did you remember the words I taught you yesterday?"</p>
<p>I would deliberately shake my head. She would open the book, half believing, half doubting, extending her slender and rounded index finger, pointing to the words in the book, and quietly teaching me: "Last year on the Lantern Festival, the flower market was as bright as a painting, the moon rose above the willow branches, we agreed to meet after dusk..."</p>
<p>Before she could finish reading, I "pooh" laughed, so she gently tickled my armpits, saying with a smile, "You little fool! Tricking me again!"</p>
<p>After such a simple game, she would always be the first to lose her smile. I often wanted to make her laugh heartily, but at most, I could only get a slight smile. In my small mind, I couldn't help but wonder: "What's bothering my sister?" I had long wanted to tell Mom about her crying in secret, but I was afraid she would get angry with me. I love my sister more than I love Mom!</p>
<p>On the afternoon before the wedding day, the groom's family arrived to "present the betrothal gifts." The sound of the "wind and percussion" was sometimes passionate, sometimes melancholic, and it made my heart ache!</p>
<p>My sister's face became even more worried, and her spirit seemed even more tired. My cousins surrounded her, chattering:</p>
<p>"Xiang'er, why aren't you happy? Tomorrow night you will..."</p>
<p>"She's pretending! She's happy inside!"</p>
<p>"No! Look how thin Xiang'er is, and her complexion is bloodless."</p>
<p>"She's lovesick!..."</p>
<p>"Hahahaha..."</p>
<p>My cousins laughed so hard they were doubled over. My sister's face suddenly flushed red, half crying, half laughing, wanting to speak but unable to, until her eyes became moist, and she collapsed onto the pillow. Some of my cousins looked surprised, others felt embarrassed and retreated to the side, blaming each other:</p>
<p>"Your joke was too much. She's feeling sad!"</p>
<p>"Who? If you hadn't started with the funny stories, how would I have—anyway, I didn't mean to..."</p>
<p>"Even if you didn't mean to, but she—I hear the new brother-in-law is a..." The speaker looked towards my sister and suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>The next day, they started "sending off the bride" early in the morning. The "veil" on my sister's head, the "wedding dress" on her body, and the "wedding shoes" on her feet were all bright red. The nanny and my second aunt helped her downstairs, walked into the ancestral hall, and her whole body was trembling. Her chest was rising and falling, as if she was crying very hard, sobbing very hard, but her face was covered by the "veil," so it was hard to see clearly. At this time, the "bridal sedan" was beside the steps outside the ancestral hall, and the "musicians" were blowing hard and playing hard, as if they were about to snatch my sister away!</p>
<p>With the support of my second aunt and the nanny, my sister paid her respects to the clay ancestors, bid farewell to her living parents, and couldn't help but cry out loud, her whole body like a puddle of mud. My second aunt and the nanny worked hard to help her out of the ancestral hall. It was hard to help her into the bridal sedan. So, the "musicians" played and beat with special effort—in the midst of the urgent and noisy blowing and beating, the bridal sedan was carried away, and my sister's cries gradually became hoarse!</p>
<p>On the day of "returning to the parents' home," while the sedan was still on the village road, the children shouted, "Look at the groom! Look at the new brother-in-law!" So, my cousins and sisters-in-law crowded to the window, and the older women and male guests huddled on the street outside the ancestral hall. I was also very excited, squeezing into the crowd, thinking, "What does the new brother-in-law look like!" After a while, the sedan arrived at the door. My second aunt and the nanny greeted the sedan my sister was in, helping her into the ancestral hall. The second sedan, for the new brother-in-law, had just been placed at the entrance when my heart started pounding wildly: "What does he look like!" But I immediately changed my mind: "He should be good!" But "Big Red Leaf" immediately lifted the sedan curtain, leading out a black, short, limping cripple. I couldn't help but feel a chill run through my body, and I angrily cursed in my heart: "What kind of monster is this!" At this time, there were exclamations from the guests, giggles from the window, and my face was burning hot, and my heart was aching like needles!</p>
<p>Soon the chime sounded, and my sister stood side by side with that monster on the red carpet, paying respects to the ancestors, thanking her parents... My sister was a head taller than him, and it was infuriating to see him standing next to her. He was so ugly, and I heard he was a bit slow-witted. How could he be worthy of my sister's beauty? And she could write poetry and paint! I was extremely resentful—resentful that my parents didn't find a good brother-in-law for my sister!</p>
<p>As soon as the ceremony was over, that monster began to yawn, drool, and couldn't stand or sit still. The relatives thought he was sick, but Big Red Leaf quickly ordered them to prepare an opium lamp, saying that his "addiction" was coming on! At this time, the relatives were all quietly discussing:</p>
<p>"How can he have an addiction!"</p>
<p>"Who isn't like this in a wealthy family!"</p>
<p>My sister was helped into the back room, and my cousins warmly greeted her.</p>
<p>"Xiang'er, do you want to eat? Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>"You've lost weight! Are you sick?"</p>
<p>My sister shook her head with a bitter smile, her face pale, her eyes losing their luster, and much of her former liveliness and beauty had disappeared!</p>
<p>Soon my mother came in. As soon as she called out "Child," my sister threw herself into her arms and burst into tears, as if all the endless grievances and endless pain were in this crying. My mother wiped her tears, unable to stop herself from shedding a few tears, and after a long time, she choked out, "Child, don't, don't be sad, as long as you have food and clothing..."</p>
<p>My sister cried even harder. At this time, my cousins were all looking sympathetic and sad, and some were even shedding tears!</p>
<p>The next day, she was supposed to return to her husband's house. My sister refused to go downstairs no matter what. The sedan was waiting outside, and that monster had already gotten into the sedan. The more my mother tried to persuade her, the more my sister cried, her face and body covered in tears, her hair already disheveled! My father sorted things out downstairs several times, but to no avail. Finally, he couldn't stand it anymore and ran upstairs. He called my cousins away and then put on a stern face and said to my sister, "You've read so many books, don't you even know the etiquette of the 'sages'? 'A man must marry, a woman must be married,' and you are now someone else's person!—It is said that 'Marry a chicken, follow a chicken; marry a dog, follow a dog'..."</p>
<p>Before my father could finish speaking, my sister suddenly stopped crying and looked at him angrily:</p>
<p>"Stop talking. I've heard enough of your great principles..."</p>

<p>— Shi Yong</p>
<p>When reading "History," I always felt an infinite yearning for the history of the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution, always feeling that the great era was full of great passion.</p>
<p>I myself once bathed in the same great era: the May Fourth Movement, the May Thirtieth Movement, the National Revolution. Although I may not have personally participated in all of that epoch-making work, I have seen the heroic posture of the great waves crashing.</p>
<p>But the youthful spirit of ideological liberation in the May Fourth era, the angry tide of the anti-imperialist and national liberation movements in the May Thirtieth era, and the ardent "esprit de corps" of the national revolutionary sentiment during the Northern Expedition in 1927—where have they gone today? Now, the whole country has returned to the road of restoration, the revolutionary spirit has completely subsided, and the whole country is silently waiting for the continuous oppression by imperialists!</p>
<p>The tide of the great era has stopped, stopped! All that has passed lingers only in dreams!</p>
<p>After watching the trial screening of Dian Tong's "Goddess of Liberty," it rekindled my memories of the past. On the screen, Wang Ying played a woman of the era who ran through the four great eras of the twenty years from the May Fourth Movement to the January 28th Incident, starting with Nora's posture and leaping into the war of anti-imperialist and national liberation movements, deeply portraying the characteristics of the four eras.</p>
<p>What stimulated me the most, strangely enough, was hearing that national revolutionary song that "has not been played for a long time": on the screen, many revolutionaries were singing in the carriages of a slowly moving train, "Down with ××, eliminate the warlords." It seemed like yesterday, but that simple and powerful song had long been silenced!</p>
<p>All of this gave me a refresher course, and the emotions seemed to return to that time!</p>
<p>China is in a situation today where the degree of harm is greater than it was ten years ago. The dark shadow of danger is looming before our eyes. How should we rekindle the torch of the times, restore the spirit of struggle in the past, and step on the difficult road to resist oppression and resist exploitation! Children of the times, our shoulders are bearing greater and more arduous work than the May Fourth and May Thirtieth eras!</p>
<p>However, the whole country is only returning to the road of restoration, the revolutionary spirit has completely subsided, and the whole country is silently waiting for the continuous oppression by imperialists!</p>
<p>Ah, where are the children of the times?</p>

<p>So, while fixing her hair, she walked down the stairs, as if rolling down. She didn't want anyone to help her, and she sat in the sedan herself, with unknown strength, suddenly walking so fast!</p>
<p>Looking at the sedan that was about to leave the courtyard gate, my father said to himself: "This child can be considered 'knowledgeable and polite!'"</p>
<p>But in less than three days, the groom's family sent news of death, saying that my sister had hanged herself the night before. This news was like a bolt from the blue. My mother was immediately shocked into unconsciousness, and my father was so angry that he beat his chest. The whole family cried together. After my aunts and uncles shouted for a long time, my mother finally regained consciousness, but while crying, she pointed at my father and said, "It's all your fault for harming my daughter! You betrothed her to someone while she was still in my belly!"</p>
<p>"Womb betrothal, am I the only one who does that?" my father said, wiping his tears, "This is just her fate!"</p>
<p>At the time, I couldn't tell whether it was my father's fault or my sister's "fate"? I just secretly shed many tears, feeling that my sister's death was pitiful!</p>

<h3 id="e236">Random Notes on Rural Life <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Ke</p>
<p>To estimate the concrete posture of a country and an era, rather than judging from the various aspects of upper-level architecture such as politics, academics, and culture, it is better to search for some truth about the daily activities of the people in villages and valleys, and then summarize and statistically analyze them, which will surely obtain a more realistic and correct true value. I quite want to get closer to the countryside for this reason, but often it only becomes a remembrance, because the whip of life drives me to gradually move away from the countryside. In recent years, I have become somewhat estranged from the actual situation of the countryside. But the countryside has not stopped because of this, and it is precisely because of the reactionary waves of the era that many bizarre and strange situations have been impacted. I often think that these are all materials for dizzying farces.</p>
<p>Below, I will introduce two novel events in a corner of the rural group.</p>
<p>(1) The Spreading of the Demonic Atmosphere at ×× Xuan</p>
<p>×× Xuan is a planchette writing group organized by local celebrities with considerable status. It is presided over by Mr. Zhao ××, a famous calligrapher and painter in the Jiangzhe area.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao traveled extensively throughout the famous mountains and rivers of China in his early years, and once served as a county magistrate in a certain county. His calligraphy and paintings are upright and beautiful, and he is indeed a rare talent. After returning to his hometown, he made a living by practicing calligraphy and painting. For a time, many people came to ask for his calligraphy and painting, and many people came to the door claiming to be his disciples. Unexpectedly, in recent years, I don't know what kind of inspiration came over him, and he believed in the Living Buddha Jigong, built a ×× Xuan, used planchette writing to ask about the past and the future for people, and prescribed prescriptions for people to cure diseases, and for a time, his career was flourishing.</p>
<p>With such celebrities and famous people making an appeal, ignorant men and women responded like planning. The atmosphere of superstition spread inside and outside the city.</p>
<p>Most of the newspapers in the area that were responsible for advocating public opinion were old and dull. Those who did not belong to the gentry faction were trying to act like gentry, so most of them did not comment on or criticize such ignorant actions. A certain ×× newspaper even published the prescription obtained from the planchette writing for treating the epidemic on the newspaper and introduced and praised it, which made readers sigh.</p>
<p>Who knows that the strangeness of the situation is not limited to this. Recently, a villager suffered from a poisonous sore on his arm. He said that he sought medical treatment at the planchette writing altar. Mr. Zhao wrote a prescription, and do you know what secret recipe or elixir was written on it? It was actually the words "Girl's menstrual blood boiled into soup and applied." Those who saw it were amazed, and the patient wanted to seek the so-called "girl's menstrual blood," which took great pains. I don't know how this villager found the girl's menstrual blood.</p>
<p>(2) False Claim of Winning the First Prize in the Lottery</p>
<p>This place is adjacent to Shanghai, and many children from middle and upper-class families study commerce in Shanghai. However, in recent years, due to the decline of industry and commerce at sea, those without a solid background often face the threat of unemployment.</p>
<p>The suicide victim I am talking about here did not commit suicide because of unemployment. He worked in a certain company through his sister's connections, and his monthly salary was no less than fifty or sixty gold yuan. He should have had more than enough for his personal life. Unexpectedly, he recently had a whimsical idea and falsely claimed to have won the first prize in the aviation lottery. First, after learning the first prize number, he went to the store that sold the lottery tickets and pretended to ask if a certain number (the first prize number) had won. The store then told him that he had won the prize. The lottery store then sent someone to the company where he worked to congratulate him, and asked if he planned to entrust the lottery store to collect the prize money on his behalf. He generously paid a reward of several yuan, saying that he would withdraw it from the bank himself, and would have another reward after he received it, and then waved him away. Since then, people in the company all thought that Mr. Mou had won the first prize, and they were all very happy, and he was infatuated with a modern woman, and his actions were extravagant, as if he had become a rich man. Later, his sister-in-law heard about it and advised Mr. Mou not to waste all his winnings, and should withdraw some and deposit it in the bank for future use. However, because Mr. Mou did not win the prize money, he was forced to be poor, and Mr. Mou said that he had not won the prize money. His sister-in-law was very surprised and knew that there was something wrong. She immediately asked the company manager to check the accounts he was responsible for. After cleaning up, it was found that there was a huge amount of more than two thousand yuan. After a comedy was over, what followed was the tragedy of suicide.</p>
<p>The various aspects of the countryside are no less lively than the scenery of the metropolis. Will the fate of the countryside fall into a collapsing volcano in the same way? Thinking about it, I can't help but feel lost.</p>

<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>In addition, the living conditions of overseas Chinese in other parts of India are the same as those in Calcutta, and there is no need to describe them one by one.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hong Kong was originally a barren island at the mouth of the Pearl River, with no residents. It was not until the Opium War between China and Britain in 1840 that China was defeated and signed a treaty ceding Hong Kong to the British. In 1842, the Treaty of Nanjing reaffirmed this. Since then, the barren Hong Kong has become an important commercial and military town under the management of the British, and is called the "Giant Port of Asia."</p>
<p>According to a 1920 survey, the total number of people in the territory was 514,600, of which 501,000 were Chinese, which can be said to be a purely Chinese city. In terms of industry and commerce, of course, the Chinese occupy an absolute advantage, but the power of rule is entirely in the hands of the British, so the actions of the vast majority of Chinese here are extremely inconvenient. Moreover, the British use the geographical relationship to use Hong Kong to directly carry out economic and political aggression against us. It is really regrettable to say! (To be continued)</p>

<p>A Page from the Diary of the "Sea Burial" Location Crew</p>
<p>Fu Baolu approached the dying Xiao Chen, but Xiao Chen died halfway. The scene of this play is truly beautiful.</p>
<p>Liu Hua's image seemed to hold infinite thoughts, and Fang Bei lowered her head as if she also held infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>The fishermen pushed their carts forward in a line, each sweating profusely. Judging by their looks, it was very strenuous for them.</p>
<p>Liu Li Ying lost her support, and everyone helped her build the grave. Fu Baolu helped out at the scene due to kinship, but Li Ying couldn't help but cry. Usually the most playful Baolu also put away his smile and stared blankly in a daze. The charming Fang Bei comforted Li Ying. Under this tense atmosphere, it truly moved the hearts of every staff member. Only the cold-hearted Director Wang not only showed no sign of sorrow but even wore a knowing smile.</p>
<p>"Sea Burial" A Collection of Sea Tales</p>
<p>The sea boats used in "Sea Burial" have all been completed and will soon undergo a launching ceremony.</p>
<p>Many items for the Dragon King Temple were shipped from Shandong.</p>
<p>There are now three statues of the Little Dragon King. Tianyi's construction workers have also specially made a large statue of the Dragon King, which is more than two zhang tall.</p>
<p>Fu Baolu, Tian Fang, Chen Tianguo, and others are called warriors of the sea, forever fighting against the waves of the ocean.</p>
<p>The fishing nets and ropes used for fishing are all specially made. Each fishing rope can weigh more than a hundred catties.</p>
<p>Ma Dongwu originally played a role in "Sea Burial," but due to his death, someone else will take over.</p>

<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>Wang Yin returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday afternoon. The body of Mu Lixia is scheduled to be placed in a coffin on the second day and the funeral will be held on the same day. When Wang Yin saw the body of Lu at the China Funeral Home, he was overwhelmed with grief. After the funeral is over, Wang still has to go to Hangzhou because there are still important scenes for him in the location shooting of "Triumphant Song."</p>
<p>"Storm" will be released after the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the film is performing very well.</p>
<p>Hu Ping's scenes in "Hero of the Times" started shooting ahead of schedule. This is in response to Yun Wei's request for Hu Ping.</p>
<p>The "Triumphant Song" location crew has returned from Zhuji to Hangzhou. Some of the staff and actors have returned to Shanghai, and some personnel are still remaining, because several locations in Hangzhou also need to be filmed.</p>
<p>One shot of the first sea ship sailing in a stormy ocean in "Storm" was filmed by Zhou Ke. The light is serene and beautiful, and it is full of poetic and artistic flavor. The original cinematographer of this film was Wu Weiyun, but Wu then left for Hangzhou with the "Triumphant Song" location crew. Therefore, this first and also the last concluding shot was replaced by Yuan Congmei, who invited Zhou Ke to take over.</p>
