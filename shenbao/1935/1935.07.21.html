<h3>上海之公共交通問題</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>上海為綰轂中外之巨埠。其殷聞與繁榮。在全國都市中。最具優越之勢。一般謀事之人。以其出路較廣。機緣易得。卽相率為尾閭之洩。甚至原有職業者。亦且舍其所騖。來圖別棲。而新置各類機關。大都不供膳宿。此大批被雇用階級。自不得不携眷挈拏。別謀賃處。無怪上海人口之日趨于激增也。</p>
<p>旅居上海之人。舍富有者勿論。關於日常生活之衣食住行四者。殆無不疾首蹙額于宅賃之昂貴。蓋衣食兩項。所費雖屬不貲。猶得視個人之力量。留伸縮之餘地。惟房租負擔。絲毫不客假借。最苦無法應付。房租之差率。以所在地之熱鬧與否為衡。中戶人家。旣不堪聚居之偪仄。復難勝巨額之獨任。往往下遷偏僻窩遠之處。以期减輕負担。顧實際上與所服務之機關差距太遠。出入亦殊感不便。可資以代步者自為車輛。而汽車非通常人所能問鼎。人力車又不適用於遠距離。唯一合於理想條件老。祇有電車與公共汽車耳。所謂「迅快穩廉大衆可坐」之標語固。吾人所心許默認者也。公共車輛對於市民之需要。旣如此其殷迫。吾人寗可不予嚴切之注意乎。</p>
<p>以言上海公共交通。就表面觀。不可謂不發達綜。計公共租界有有軌電車十路。無軌電車七路。公共汽車九路。法租界有有軌電車七路。無軌電車一路。公共汽車兩路。南市方面有電車四路。公共汽車四路。閘北方面有公共汽車三路。此在數年以前。原亦足敷行駛。惟今茲情形。略有出入以。上海地面之遼闊。昔所視為偏僻之境者。頃以住戶紛紛遷往。實際已成半熱閙區而上述各項車輛。大都行駛於中心地帶。未能收利便均沾之效。尤以法租界之各項路綫。局於一隅。幾使大部分之居民。咸淪於不便利情况中。自廿二路公共汽車變更路綫。稍予一部分居民以欣慰。猶嫌其行駛車輛不多。夜停時間太早。此外關於公共租界與法租界間之南北道。殊少溝通之行車路綫。亦為一顯著之缺憾。吾人鑒於公共車輛攸關民生之殷切。為僻區之住戶利益計。敢向市政當局提三要求。（一）增闢路綫。（二）多放車輛。（三）延長行駛時間。一方旣予居民以利便。一方亦增市面之繁榮。甚願主持者有以壓市民之望也。</p>
<h3>東京朝日論　對華二期工作　捨解决懸案取合作主義</h3>
<p>（華聯社東京通訊）據東京朝日新聞云、日外交部正在擬定對華外交工作具體案、待成案决定後、則與有關係之各省洽商、聞外交部擬之基調、在於放棄消極主義、從解决懸案、再進取中日協力主義、一九三三年五月、塘沽協定成立後、為九一八事變中斷之外交、再回復外交工作、至本年二月之蔣汪共同宣言時期為第一期工作、從此以後已入第二期工作、第一期為中日外交之消極調整時期、此期之日本外交、在於確立東亞政策在極力驅除列强在東亞之勢力、第二期工作乃從交換大使起、雖有河北問題及察案糾紛、但此兩案之解决、反促成二期工作之基本條件、外交當局將棄其懸案解决主義、積極促進中日之合作、期待中國自動動從政治經濟文化各方面、與日本合作、此後外交工作之重心、則與中國戮力、進行穩定東亞之建設工作云、</p>

<h3>日對加拿大　商戰已吿具體化　昨日施行報復關稅　並謀應付埃及廢約</h3>
<p>（東京）日政府爲報復加拿大之抵制日貨、今日發動通商擁護法、對坎貨特別征重稅、加政府對日本之處置甚不滿意、加貨之損失在六百萬美金元、故加政府擬從兩種對策中採取一策對付日本、其第一策為取消日坎通商條約、為二為對日貨再抽從價之三分之一、以示報復、日政府所接情報、料加方將採第二策云、（二十日華聯電）</p>
<p>沃太華　此間今日得悉、政府現正考慮徵收日貨百分之三三·三之附加稅、藉以報復日本最近抵制加拿大物品之舉動、並聞加拿大政府僅願徵收附加稅、而不欲取消兩國間之商約、此間政府官員對於日本徵收加拿大貨物之禁銷稅太為失望、據此間估計、價値一千六百萬元之加拿大貨物將因日本之通商擁護法而被排斥、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>大阪　埃及政府宣告廢止日埃通商條約、大阪紡續聯合會·棉花同業會·輸出綿紗布同業會·日英貿易恊會等四團體、十九日下午開聯席會議、協議對策之結果、發表如下聲明書、日本前應埃及政府要求、積極進口埃及產棉、緣自本年一月至五月統計、日埃貿易輸入超過輸出八百萬元、然埃及政府今次廢止兩國通商條約、對日貨課加關稅一倍、埃及如此暴舉、日本應以抵制埃棉報復、然現因未接詳電、定於二十日重開會議、决定最後方針、（二十日日聯電）</p>
<h3>日本荷蘭　海運戰亦激化　日商陷於苦境</h3>
<p>大阪　荷印政府自頒布運卸以荷船為本位及限制輸入品以來、日本海運商更陷於苦境、茲者日本之南洋海運會社發表其苦鬥主義之方針如下、</p>
<p>（一）茲為與渣華輪船爭鬥起見、配駛各船、决不减少、以後仍將石原產業、大阪商船、南洋郵船三社之配船共十四艘、繼承每月六回航行之積極方針、此外並施行由石原產業會社出資代理之南洋貨棧事業、</p>
<p>（二）印日荷海運會議再開時、日方亦不提要求直待與渣華輸船公司苦戰得勝時再說、</p>
<p>（三）荷印對於日貨及日商權之壓、一面請求政府繼續抗議、一面作持久戰、希望政府增加補助金、以資維持、</p>
<p>（四）若荷印方面讓步要求再開海運會議、則必須圖日荷通商貿易之圓滿解决始可、（二十日華聯電）</p>

<h3>關東軍向外蒙　提出最後覺書　限十日內答覆二次要求否則驅逐某處外蒙軍隊</h3>
<p>（大連）外蒙與「滿」方關於解决邊界爭議之談判、久延未决、關東軍今日已以實際上無異哀的美敦書之文件送交外蒙當局、關東軍領袖聲稱、如外蒙當局不允接受「滿」方第二次建議、互換僑民代表、則駐於台蘇古蘇瑪（譯音）之外蒙軍隊、將予驅逐、並限外蒙當局於十日內答覆、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>日答覆俄抗議　不認一切並謂責任在俄</h3>
<p>（東京）蘇俄政府曾於七月二日對於日政府提出抗議、責問日軍越過俄滿國境事件、日外務命駐滿南大使調查眞相、頃已接到其詳細報告書、否認有其事實、外務省乃於二十日下午將其答覆書送達蘇俄大使館、反駁俄方抗議、其內容要旨如下、日本政府命駐滿大使調查之結果、查知貴函所表示第一第二·第四·第五各項並非事實　又第六·第七項之日軍越境事件更非事實、至於第三項之原因為貴國軍隊侵入「滿洲國」而射擊滿兵、其責任在於貴國、總之、貴函表示之一切事件全部無根據、關於射擊滿兵之事責任在貴方、故貴政府之抗議毫無根據、又日艦經過黑龍江水路之件、從來已成為常例、至今忽然抗議此事、此日政府殊難諒解之點也、日政府對於俄滿國境之和平與秩序維持、常有重大關心、平時嚴命駐滿官憲防止越境等事、如有意外事件發生、卽在現地從速解决、然蘇俄政府對於日駐滿官憲加以不當誹謗、故意誇張宣傳、令世人發生疑惑、實為日俄兩國親善關係不堪道之事也、（二十日日聯電）</p>

<p>雅典　閣潮昨晚已解决、蔡達理斯總理昨日午後向柴密斯總統提呈新閣員名單後、各新閣員已宣誓就職、此次政潮結果可謂陸長龔第利斯之勝利、益陸軍方面曾明白表示、堅持龔氏仍任陸長、蔡總理接洽時、遂不得不僅事改組、而將反對龔氏之閣員摒棄、惟新閣中帝制派勢力是否增進、現尙未明耳、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>雅典　柴密斯總統已委前總理蔡達理斯組閣、公民投票表决帝制共和之爭、原定十一月十五日舉行、是否如期舉行、抑或暫行展期、由蔡總理如何改組內閣可得眉目、此次政潮引起種種謠言、例如前陸長龔第利斯將與空軍司令勒巴斯及海軍參謀長伊國諾摩夫恊謀武力復辟說、卽其尤者、此類謠傳現已由消息靈通方面否認、且龔第利斯現已蟬聯陸長之職矣、惟局勢仍甚緊張、蔡總理因於今日午後宣布、嚴厲取締擾亂治安云云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>阿比西尼亞堅拒　喪權辱國條件　不願為保護國或代管地　意軍中暑死者病者甚多</h3>
<p>阿京　阿王今日向路透特別訪員發表談片、切實聲明、凡任何解决辦法、以阿國土地爲意國或他國之保護地或代管地、致損及阿國之獨立與主權及其人民之自由者、渠必拒絕之、渠信阿國理由正當、蓋阿政府始終努力欲獲和平解决也、但意國如對阿甩兵、則阿人必堅决抵抗、所不幸者、他國禁止軍火之對阿供給、致使阿國捍衛疆土以禦外敵之工作愈感困難耳、但阿國朝野仍希望凱洛格公約簽字國當可設法斡旋、以免使世人皆知該約僅爲一紙具文、而可爲任何野心國所弁髦、吾人現待國聯之决議、蓋吾人確信公道終必勝利也云云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　阿比西尼亞外長發表聲明、稱阿皇昨日之訓詞、當足表明阿國拒絕意國或他國代管之態度云、阿皇昨日向國會演說終了之時、有至堪動人之事發生、綠皇演說至「寗願隨國人戰死而不願放棄自由」之語、聽衆歡聲雷動、突有回敎徒領袖趨至皇座、高呼回敎臣民願隨國內之天主敎徒並力殺敵、此間認回敎徒領袖作此宣言、已消釋回敎徒不參戰之謠、英國公使今日與阿國外長會談兩小時、關係討論英屬索馬里邊境之徵稅問題云、（十九日國民電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）意國各報載倫敦消息、謂駐羅馬英國大使德魯蒙爵士已接訓令、請意政府準備在國聯行政院會議提出關於阿比西尼亞案之書面陳述云云、惟據消息靈通之意人各界聲稱、英大使迄今未作此請、聞英國曾探詢意政府願否根據一九〇六年條約與英法政府討論一切、衆意此項討論今將由外交途徑進行、絕不致出以會議方式、因意政府不欲陷入任何調和解决、致不能獲對阿之軍事與顧問的控制權也、同時菲洲意軍中暑死者已達七十人、而伊里特里意屬索瑪里倫及昆連阿境之意殖民地已有勞工二千人入療養院、按遣往意殖民地兩處之勞工、共二萬三千人、今病者已有二千、約佔總數百分之九矣、（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）外報盛傳英曾勸吿意國、謂國聯行將開會、希望意國準備提出關於意阿爭執之詳細節略云云、此間官塲完全否認此說、消息靈通方面亦稱、墨索里尼首相並未與英國大使舉行會談、意報批評星期四阿國皇向國會發表之訓詞　、各項條約證明華爾華爾爲意國領土、而阿皇則稱屬於阿國、一九〇六年條約明白規定、自鳥畢束北行至塞貝利之疆界與一八九六年條約中規定之疆界相符合、而前約之第四欵中複載明部落民族所居之向海各地、統歸意國版圖、惟奧格頓全部屬於阿國、總之意國佔領華爾華爾已有多年、阿國方面突欲以武力奪回該地、卽係共侵略計畫之明蹬、故意國應有權要求道歉及賠償云、（二十日國民電）</p>

<h3>銀錢業函復貸欵會　擔認信用放欵確數　銀行一百萬錢業二十五萬元　貸欵章則日內可望修正公佈</h3>
<p>新新社云、上海工商業貸欵審查委員會所擬貸欵章則、現正在呈部修正中、最短期內、可望核准實施、銀錢兩業所担認信用借欵數額、已開單函復該會、提倡國貨同盟會定期召開緊急會議、討論救濟工商辦法、並請早日實施貸欵、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>銀錢兩業認定確數</p>
<p>工商貸欵審查會、以此項貸欵二千萬元、除一千五百萬抵押借欵、由各行莊自行貸放外、五百萬信用借欵、則由貸欵會代放、爰根據上次委會議决、分函銀錢兩業公會請將認定數額、開單送會、昨晨據該會發言人稱、兩業復函已到、錢業由錢業準備庫認定二十五萬元、銀行公會各會員銀行（中國交通在外）已認定一百萬元、現仍繼續勸認、有增加希望、至中·中·交·三行前曾表示共認二百五十萬元、現尙未接有正式通知、但事關救濟工商、可望無甚問題、</p>
<p>貸欵章則仍在修正</p>
<p>貸欵會所擬貸欵保證細則辦事程序等各項章則、自呈財部鑒核後、財部為力求貨欽手續簡捷、辦法務須週密起見、對於修正條文、極為審愼、故、連日與貸欵會文換意見、逐條修改、頗形忙碌、現已大致修改就緒、尙有數點、則待二十二日下午三時、召開委員會議、徵詢各委員意見、函復財部後、最短期內、可望批准實施、</p>

<h3>淞口海塘鞏固　高橋海塘工務局隨時察勘</h3>
<p>際此各地多吿水患之時、本埠淞口海塘之安危、關係滬太嘉賓各縣生靈至鉅、據中央社記者探悉、該海塘自前年經兩决颶風吹擊後、去歲卽太加修築、全塘工程、至為堅固、日來長江發、淞口外水勢益形洶湧、因塘工堅固、雖倍受風浪衝擊、但未受影響、並悉寳由縣長日前曾率員赴該塘察勘、並飭屬隨時注意修築、至於高橋一帶之海塘亦極堅固、市工務局隨時派員察勘云、</p>
<p>又訊、前昨兩日、吳淞口海潮暴漲、目値大汛時期、故潮水日見增高、與吳淞外馬路、相差僅一二尺、依周塘一帶低窪處、已與岸齊、幸無颶風發現、故仍波平浪靜、寳山海塘、自去歲大修後、塘身尙稱堅固、並無出險之處云、</p>
<h3>歐亞航空公司　籌闢西蓉航綫　半粵綫暫時停航</h3>
<p>國聞社云、本埠歐亞航空公司、近日積極籌備西安至成都間之飛航綫、約於下月初正式開航、同時平粵綫、因客貨極少、暫緩開航、茲分誌詳情於后、</p>
<p>籌闢西蓉航綫該　公司除原有平粵·滬新·蘭寗·寗包·四綫外、近日積極籌備西安至成都間之飛航、並向德國定購雙發動容克斯式機三架、以資應用、昨據該公司查秘書語記者、稱、兩地機塲無庸另闢、且途中山嶺氣候、皆較滬新綫極西段為佳、大致無多大困難、俟有機會、卽行試飛、約於下月初、卽可正式開航、</p>
<p>平粵暫停開航　又該公司平粵綫、邇來因長江水勢暴漲、長沙漢口兩站機塲、皆為洪水淹沒、飛機不能升降、同時鄭州至廣州段、客貨極少、飛機亦不够分配、故决定將該綫暫停開航、現公司方面、正進行購機事宜、俟其到滬、卽行復航、至於滬新綫、現仍祇能飛至蘭州為止、惟西安至蘭州、寗夏至包頭兩綫、近日客貨、均異常擁擠、已於上週起、增加班次、改為每週往返各二次云、</p>
<h3>英郵船在淞口　與建康艦碰撞　雙方報告各執一辭英艦回滬方明眞相</h3>
<p>大英輪船公司正班郵船開什埃希號、Kaisai　I　Hind自倫敦，來滬後、停在公和祥碼頭、卸去旅客、於十六日下午三時、裝載貨客、離開碼頭、駛出吳淞、向日本神戶進發、約在下午五時左右、將近高橋江面、適浦江狂風大作、淞口發生鉅浪、而海軍部驅逐艦建康號、亦在高橋附近江面停泊、因受大風浪之冲盪、致英郵船船身、與建康艦船頭、猛撞一下、該艦頭部、損壞甚重、</p>
<p>電告</p>
<p>英郵船開什埃希號、净載量一萬一千噸、船體巨大、鋼板又厚、而建康艦則艦體甚小、載量三百九十噸、長二零八英尺、闊二十一英尺、馬力八千匹、每時速度十六海哩、經此猛碰、頭部立時毀壞、須入廠重加修建、損失若干、須進塢檢騐後、方可明瞭、英郵船以船期關係、不能延誤、碰撞後略一檢騐船體、外舷鐵板尙無大損、故仍照常駛出吳淞口而赴東洋、惟船主已在途中、發電來滬、向上海公司報告、先述碰撞經過、次言過失不在英輪、如果郵船船身、內部或有損壞、須由該艦負責、俟由日返滬時、再行騐看交涉、</p>
<p>知函</p>
<p>海軍部據建康艦艦長報告、則謂該艦被撞、責任全在英輪、因建康停泊在吳淞江面也、艦身頭部、損害程度甚重、茲擬本月二十二日、進高昌廟江南船塢、先行檢騐損壞、然後動工修理、陳司令根據此項報告、已函致大英輪船公司、正式提出交涉、英郵船開什埃希號、須負碰撞之責、擔認建康艦修理各費、</p>
<p>查問</p>
<p>大英輪船公司、對於此案、現在尙無確切辦法表示、蓋因開什埃希輪、正値赴日、無從詢得眞相、而該輪在橫濱神戶略裝貨客後、便須返滬、大約在八月五日可以抵滬、俟其到上海後、再行傳集該輸船主、詢此案碰撞眞相、以决定責任之所在、而於郵船內部、有無其他損傷、亦須俟其返滬後、方可得知一切、目前兩方報告、均不能採作確定之詞也、</p>

<h3>特載　簡易壽險與社會保險　（續）</h3>
<p>— 張明昕</p>
<p>（四）簡易壽險之意義</p>
<p>簡易壽險為人壽保險之一種、共所不同者、惟在其契約條欺與其經營方法、然無論為人壽保險或簡易壽險、其制度之創立、俱須依據左列之原則、方克奏效、</p>
<p>（一）為救濟多數人民所感共通不安之生活、</p>
<p>（二）危險發生有相當之秩序、</p>
<p>（三）世人藉此具有利用之能力、處現在複雜社會組織中、世人頗感生活之不安定、家庭之中、嘗因從事經濟生產者之夭亡、以致家口嗷嗷、無法維持、勢必藉壽險制度之成立、以分担各人所遭受之危險、然危險之發生、必須有相當之秩序、方克救濟、因人壽保險在利川數理上之「槪然數律」、以已往之經騐、而推及於將來、在危險發生率中、發現一定之秩序、得有死亡統計表之利用、惟無論何項制度之創設、須能適合於利用者之能力、否則雖有良好之制度、仍無補於事實、故普通人壽保險、雖爲世人所需要、第閃保費較高、致投保者多為富有資產之人、而中下級人民、多無資力可以加入、自難普及於民衆、簡易壽險創行之意義、即以小額保費之人壽保險、以保障中下級人民因其生命夭亡所受之經濟損失也、</p>
<p>簡易壽險、為一種普及民衆之社會事業、旣如上述、然在歐美各國為工業壽險、Indu　trial　Insurance德為國民保險、Volk-ver＇Icherung法為通俗保險、Assurance　Popualire而在日本則為簡易生命保險、歐美各國、因投保簡易壽險者、多屬勞動階級、故謂之工業為險、惟在東瀛、因其為小額人壽保險、對於保戶投保手續、須求簡便、故稱之爲簡易生命保險、吾國最近頒佈之簡易人壽保險法、亦採用「簡易」字以期適切、而別於普通壽險、茲更將簡易壽險與人壽保險辦法不同之處、擇要簡述如下、</p>
<p>（一）簡易為險、爲小額保險、普通壽險保　較大投保者必為中產以上人士、我國多數公司、皆以一千元為最低限額、簡易壽險、因其宗旨、在使」般中產階級以下之人民、其有利用之能力、而獲得經濟上之保障故、故其保額規定較低、在英國為五磅至一百磅、美國平均約五百元至一千元、比利時為二百五十佛郎、日本為四百五十元、簡易壽險之主旨、雖原為工人而創　、然結果各界中下級人士投保者亦甚多、日本除勞工外、農人商人公務員之投保者、亦佔多數、此雖由簡易壽險之手續、較諸普通壽險爲便利、而保額輕微、使投保者易以獲得壽險保障之種種利益、尤為其最大之原因、</p>
<p>（二）簡易壽險保費、係短期內繳付、簡易壽險、旣為中下級人民而設立、其繳費方法、自應適合其進益之狀况、普通壽險之保費、係按年繳付、或加付利息、亦可按每半年或三個月付、然簡易壽險、須謀保戶之便利、故歐美各國、均按週繳付、日本則按月繳付、因歐美各國之工資皆按週給發、而日本則按月計算、是繳費期間、必合於保戶之經濟狀態而規定之、固無疑義也、</p>
<p>（三）簡易壽險、免騐身體、普通壽險公司、爲防止身體衰弱及染有疾病者之加入起見、故有檢騐身體、以定取捨之辦法、簡易壽險、則其立塲不同、因係為普及全國大多數民衆、使均得享受壽險之保障、加入投保者、必為數甚衆、如每人皆須檢騐身體、則共手續之煩瑣、時間之稽延、將不堪設想、且徵收之保費、更須力求低廉、欲求保費低廉、必須减輕事業費之耗損、故日本對於保戶、皆免騐身體、英國則規定於一十五鎊以下者免除之、美國則規定在五百元以上者、保險人得有檢騐之權、由此而觀、則免騐身體、實爲簡易壽險要素之一、</p>
<p>（四）簡易壽險賠償之削减期問、簡易為險、於其原理及事實上、對於被保人之身體既免檢騐、則結果必政身體衰弱或染有疾病者、紛來投保、實際保戶死亡率勢必高增、而賠價金之支出亦隨而激增、爲糾正此項之投機取巧、故有限制賠償之規定、即所謂削减期問也、日本對於保戶、在契紐成立一年內死亡時、被保人所得者、僅為已繳之　費、於一年半內死亡時、則為保額之半數、至一年半死亡時、始得領取所保全部保額、</p>
<p>（五）簡易壽險、以保費計算保額、簡易壽險、對於保額及保費之計算、與普通壽險之辦法不同、普通壽險、皆以保額而算定所應繳納之保費、如某人於三十歲時、購買終身保險一千元、則其每年應繳納保費為三十六元一角七分、簡易壽險則不然、係以所繳之保費為標準、而算定其所保之保額、如某人於三十歲時、投保終身保險、月納保費一角、則其所保之額數為四十元四角、如月納二角、則為八十元八角、餘可類推、</p>
<p>（六）簡易壽險保費、以由保險人收取爲原則、由保險人收取保費、實為辦理簡易壽險之要件、因其爲按週或按月繳付、次數頻繁、故胥由保險人派定徵收員、依期至被保人住所收取、如此旣不妨礙保戶工作時問、亦可减免保戶延宕不繳弊病、各國雖有保戶得向其局所櫃檯窗口繳付之規定、同時並予少許折扣、然實際上親詣窗口繳付者、為數寥寥、故就已往之經騐、則簡易壽險保費、非賴徵收員之收取不為功、如由保戶繳納、則結果必至有多數契約、因此失效、而危及制度之本身、</p>
<p>（五）日本簡易壽險與歐美工業壽險工業壽險之在歐美、與簡易壽險之在日本、從其經營之主體而區分、則歐美之工業壽險為民營、而日本之簡易壽險、由國家專營、蓋歐美方面、基於其自山競爭主義之發達、而有其悠久之歷央、如前所述、美國之工業壽險、幾完全操於「首都」「保愼」「約翰漢克」三公司之手、即其明證、故美國之工業壽險、僅受各區保險監督之監視、而聯邦監督法、尙無關於工業壽險之規定、又如英之工業壽險、初由國營、實爲以郵政辦理簡易壽險之嚆矢、惜非專營事業、普通壽險公司、亦可兼辦、結果趨於失敗、而民營之各壽險公司、與共濟組合等所經營者、雖得有相當之進展、然其以營利競爭為前提、對於中下級保戶之擔負、自必較國營者為高、故在普通壽險未能充分發展之國家、簡易壽險、尤有國營之必要、茲將日本簡易壽險與歐美工業壽險不同之點、略述如次、（未完）</p>

<h3>暑假期內做先生（談話）</h3>
<p>— 顏波光</p>
<p>小朋友！你記得兩句俗諺嗎？「為人不識字，有眼却似盲。」你想：盲子在暗中摸索，多麼痛苦！中國不識字的人，要佔到百分之八十，這許多文盲，不是和瞎子一樣感受到極度的痛苦嗎？</p>
<p>光陰是過得很快的，一貶眨眼你們又要放暑假了，在暑假期內，把光陰空度，不是覺得很可惜嗎？在此暑假期內，希望全國的小朋友暫時來做一下小先生試試！每當夕陽西下的時候，鄉下的四鄰農人不是要集在白塲上乘風凉嗎？，你們就可利用這個時候，做一塊薄薄的黑講板，掛在大樹上，或牆壁上，最好做一個木架子。來敎他們識字，一天識十個，十天可以識百個，就在你們的書本上找些生字敎他們吧！這樣幫助掃除文盲，你的功德很大，快快實行起來吧！不要放過了暑假期的機會！</p>
<h3>兒童掌故隨談（故事）</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>常　見敎科書裏編採的兒童故事，很多是出於杜撰，不値得給兒童們誦習謹記的。我國有說不完的歷史上有名人物幼年的故事，可供敎科書編者採用，或作敎師課餘選講助興的材料；儘是智識淺薄的兒童們議到或聽見，會覺得此那張兒李生等的故事顯然眞實，値得記憶些。這裏隨便陸續錄幾則，附加一些個人的談言，可以直接獻給我們的小同胞。</p>
<p>謝安諫刑</p>
<p>晋朝謝安，官至太傅，他在七八歲時有一天，穿着靑布褲兒坐在他哥哥身邊，看他正在做着縣官的父親審案。有一個老人犯了法，縣官罰他喝那烈性的酒；已經醉得過分了，他還被逼儘喝，謝安瞧了心中老大不忍，便低聲對他哥哥說道：「哥哥！怎麼可以這樣呢？」這話恰被他父親聽得，他不禁放和平了臉色說道：「我的小孩子要我放他麼？」他就釋放了那個老人。</p>
<p>孟夫子有話道：「惻隱之心，人皆有之。」兒童們的一片天眞原是最易動人仁愛之念；卽使成人們也未必全是殘酷乖張天生成性的，有的是為職責所拘束，不容他們一味的慈悲罷了！他們當正幹着日常幹慣的違心的事時，忽給兒童的天眞語言打動着，還能不去表同情而糾正一下麼？這就是俗諺所說的「理駁泰山」啊！</p>
<h3>麵包（常識）</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>麵包，是敏兒最喜歡吃的東西，所以時時要他的父親去買麵包。「爸爸，吃麵包是很衛生的，又是很簡便，你今天總好替我買一個，因為我己想吃了好多天了」。德兒是這樣的要求他的父親。</p>
<p>「你吃是這樣簡便，沒多天，吃完了，你要知道一個麵包要許多血汗凝成的，所以你下回吃的時候，要多多的想」。</p>
<p>「什麽叫做血汗？我不懂」。</p>
<p>「凡一件東西，是從辛苦而換到的，這叫血汗換來的東西」。</p>
<p>「那麼製造一個麵包，有多大的辛苦呢」？</p>
<p>「麵包簡單的說，是小麥做的，做一個麵包的手續分六部：一、把小麥從田裏割下來，用機器把小麥打下來。二、運到磨坊裏去磨，從小麥磨下來的麥殼，叫麥麩，麥麩裏面是麵粉。三、把麵粉放在大槽裏，再加發酵的酒母和鹽水，經過了好多次的搓揉，麵粉團就膨漲起來，這都是酒母在發酵，否則，麵包一定是不鬆了。四、生的麵團搓成了，再加些水和麵粉，再搓了一會。然後放在溫暖的地方，經過了一二小時，這麵團就會發得鬆脆了。這時候，做麵包的人，把它切成一定的重量和一定的形式。五、用一根長柄的木叉，把麵包送進爐子要去，等到放滿了，便把爐門關上，烤了一小時，就可拿出來。六、再包上了紙，便運到都市上去出賣了」。</p>
<p>「爸爸，市塲上有什麽麩皮麵包，是什麽做的」？</p>
<p>「把小麥到磨坊裏去磨，小麥磨脫棕色的外殼，倘不把小麥磨脫外殼，做成的麵包，是棕色的，這叫麩皮麵包，又叫全麥麵包，滋養料比白麵包多，並且很容易消化」。</p>
<h3>小先生（詩歌）</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>小先生，小先生，</p>
<p>年齡雖小學問深！</p>
<p>「國文」既好「算術」精，</p>
<p>「常識」「自然」件件能。</p>

<p>掃除文盲解痛苦，</p>
<p>半仗親愛小先生</p>
<h3>夏天應注意的事（衛生）</h3>
<p>— 乃常</p>
<p>許多小朋友一想起了夏天無疑的便會聯想到新鮮的太陽，美麗的海濱，凉爽的樹蔭下，以及可以袒露在衣袴外面的肢膀與腿脚。是的，夏天也許會帶來了舒快給小朋友們；但是在相反的方面，夏天也帶來了疾病給你們啊！</p>
<p>在夏天里，小朋友們第一應注意的是飲食。所謂「病從口入」，這話是不錯的。小朋友們在夏天里最愛食的是冷品；但是當跑路跑得全身發熱的時候，腸里面也是一團熱火，如果這時立卽把冷東西灌下腸子；利害的會把腸子破裂了，輕些的也會害一大塲疾病。原因是腸子像坡璃杯子，當它冷的時候，遇到熱，或是熱的時候遇到冷，都一樣會爆裂的</p>
<p>除飲食外，其次是衣着。衣着在夏天的陽光下，分外容易見出骯髒的地方，好似我們在從窗子射進來的陽光下容易見到飛揚着的塵埃一樣。所以，在夏天應該格外注意衣着的淸潔，不然的話，夥伴們師長們便要遠避你了。</p>
<h3>近世各種偉大的發明（科學世界）</h3>
<p>— 文譽揚</p>
<p>肉舒適，好像人類用手巾摩擦全身一樣：這不是獸類也要洗澡的蹬據嗎？」</p>
<p>弟弟這才恍然大悟道：「原來動物都會洗澡的。」</p>
<h3>捕蠅（衛生）</h3>
<p>— 徐寳璋</p>
<p>這是一個可驚的算學。據動物學家說：蠅類的繁殖率很大，每一次能產卵一百六十餘個，由蛆而蛹而成蟲，不過十天左右。這時，子蠅母蠅祖母蠅，都產起卵來。小朋友！你想，一個母蠅，子子孫孫，大家產起卵來，其數不是驚人嗎？</p>
<p>或者說：一頭母蠅產起卵來，過了一月，把它所產子子孫孫的蠅，頭尾魚貫銜接起來，可以繞地球二匝。小朋友！你想，蠅類的繁殖率，驚人不驚人？</p>
<p>許多病菌，像霍亂，傷寒，赤痢，瘧疾等等，都能够殺人的疾病，往往寄生這些傳播疾病的飛機炸彈隊，撲殺到一個不剩，半個不留。小朋友！除惡務盡，努力殺賊，不是我們小國民，現在應負的責任嗎？</p>
<p>蘇東坡說：「物必先腐也，而後蟲生之。」小朋友！我們一方面，淸潔居室，食品，跟身體，講究夏令的衛生，小心飲食物的攝取；一方面努力捕蠅滅蚊。夏秋雖是多病的季節，小朋友！保你安然過去，沒有疾病。</p>
<h3>貓與鼠（匈牙利童話）</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>長遠長遠以前，貓和鼠是兩個要好的朋友。他們同住在島上，貓吃的是樹上的鳥，鼠吃的是地下的樹根。他們過着很幸福的生活。一天，鼠說道：「這島上我住厭了。我們到對面的岸上去吧。那邊可吃的東西很多，你不必再捉鳥，我不必再掘地。」</p>
<p>於是貓和鼠掘出一個大樹根，開始造船。鼠用他的尖利的牙齒挖成一個足容他們兩個的窟窿。同時，貓用他的脚爪括去樹根上的汚泥，使船的外身光滑。</p>
<p>他們做了兩枝小小的槳，便坐上船動身。</p>
<p>他們忘記把吃的東西放些在船上。貓便開始叫：「咪！咪！」意思就是說：「我餓了！我餓了！」鼠也開始叫：「吱！吱！」意思就是說：「我餓了！我餓了！」</p>
<p>貓睡着了，鼠却淸醒着，他突然想起了他們的船原來是樹根做成的。於是他咬着，咬着！把船底咬穿了，水從下面湧上來。</p>
<p>貓醒過來，看見鼠咬過的洞，恨極了，肚子又是餓得慌。</p>
<p>等到他們濕淋淋的泅到乾燥的岸上，貓就想抓住鼠來吃。可是鼠却爬進一個地洞裏。</p>
<p>從此以後，貓就常常守候在地洞口。</p>

<h3>泡泡破了（故事畫）</h3>
<p>— 張友鑑</p>
<p>（一）肥兒把橡皮泡泡套在拍水器的口上，再用根綫緊緊繫住說：「誰來放水，就要嚇一跳！」</p>
<p>（二）榮兒提了鉛桶來取水，不想抽了幾下，忽然抽水器的口上起了一個大泡泡來；頓時吃了一驚。</p>
<p>（三）「拍」的一聲，大泡泡破了，水就飛濺開來。</p>
<p>（四）榮兒抽着了一鉛桶的水，肥兒却滿身淋漓的回去。</p>
<h3>雅片自述（童話）</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>我叫雅片。我的母親是罌粟女士。伊在初夏開出很美麗的紅花或紫花，看了眞叫人心愛呢。花開了以後，就結果實。乘果實沒有成熟的時候，割破它，採取裏面的一種白汁，這種白汁乾燥之後，就成功了我—雅片。你想像我這樣有毒的東西，却是從一朶美麗的花裏產生出來的，大家都要覺得奇怪的罷。</p>
<p>罌粟本來產於小亞細亞，波斯，印度，埃及等地方，但是現在中國，有好些地方種着它們，說起來眞令人傷心呢。</p>
<p>人家現在都痛恨我，咒罵我，說我是亡國滅種的東西；其實，我倒覺得有點寃在呢。不錯，我含有嗎啡毒質，但是如果用得得法，我是可以治病的，譬如下痢和疝痛，服了我之後，就能够止住。</p>
<p>現在那些吸雅片的人，他們不是偶然吸我，而是常常吸我，天天吸我，那自然要中我的毒了。</p>
<p>天天吸我的人，面黃肌瘦，肩削背駝，活像一隻瘦猴子；但是時時想睡，動作遲緩，又不及猴子的活潑精神，簡直可以稱他們做「嬾猴」。這是身體上的損失。還有經濟上的損失：全中國每年吸到烟筒裏去的金錢，總要到幾千萬，一個國家如果長久這樣下去，眞可以到亡國的地步，你想可怕不可怕呢！</p>
<p>說起我最初到中國來，年代已經很遠了，那是在宋朝年間，由阿拉伯人運來，作為藥用。到了明朝末年，台灣人患瘧疾的，用我和砒霜混合起來，加入烟草中當藥吸，很有効騐。後來就傳到厦門，再傳到各地。起初吸的時候，我的分量還少，以後越加越多，到了後來，所吸的完全是我，一點別的雜質也沒有了。到了淸朝雍正年間，吸的人一天多」天了。雅片烟槍也製造起來了，烟館也開設起來了。淸政府方才下令禁止，但是私販私吸的却一天興旺一天。</p>
<p>到了道光十九年，中國出了一位拒毒先鋒——林則徐先生，他把二萬零二百八十三箱雅片在廣東的虎門焚燬，一面製成許多戒烟丸，叫人民戒烟，那時候，湖北，廣東兩省的吸烟人和我絕交的很是不少：可惜淸政府不能叫他始終辦理此事，弄得我的勢力又擴大起來，現在想起來還很可惜呢。</p>
<p>好了，近年來中國政府已在認眞戒烟了。我希望中國百姓拒絕我到底：我寗願自己絕種，不願害中國人！</p>

<h3>動物要洗澡嗎（笑談）</h3>
<p>— 魏冰心</p>
<p>夏　季裏動物，媽媽每天叫弟弟洗操，弟弟老是想躱避。有一天，媽媽對弟弟說：「許多動物，還常常要洗澡：你是人，怎麽可以不洗操呢？」</p>
<p>弟弟說：「我不相信動物洗操：因為我從來沒有看見過鳥類要洗操。」</p>
<p>媽媽說：「鴨和鵝都是鳥類，牠們常到池塘裏去游泳，你難道沒有看見過嗎？雞也是鳥類，牠雖然不會在水裏游泳，但是常到沙裏撲着翅膀打滾，這就是牠的洗操。養在龍子裏的鳥，常把頭部浸在水孟裏，把水濺在身上，潤濕毛羽；這不是鳥類要洗操的證據嗎？」</p>
<p>弟弟說：「那麽獸類也要洗澡的嗎？」</p>
<p>媽媽說：「是的。耕田的牛，在夏天常把全身浸在河浜裏，那是你曾經看見過的：骯髒的猪，也喜歡睡在水塘裏，翻動身體，好似再舒服也沒有了。家裏養的猫和狗，也常常要洗操；猫有時伸着前爪，向臉上不住地撫摸：狗有時舉起後爪，刷去毛上的污穢。至於馬和驢，在疲倦的時侯，常在地上打滾，使筋在蠅類的脚上嘴上。它帶了許多病菌，飛翔空中，見了食物和不潔的地方，便飛下停止，把所帶的病菌，放在上面。我們吃了這些食品，卽發生各種的時疫。所以，夏日空中的蠅類，好像敵人的「飛機炸彈隊」一般，應該努力預防纔把</p>
<p>小朋友！你們自己能够做成蠅拍，應該在現下蠅蚊初上市的時侯，做努力殺賊的工作。——捕蠅運動——約集了許多小朋友，無論在家庭，在學校，務</p>
<h3>幾件名不符實地東西</h3>
<p>— 中和</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，現在我告幾件名不符實的東西，免得被它們的名詞所騙：</p>
<p>鉛筆　鉛筆的心子，不是鉛做的，而是石墨做的。</p>
<p>鋼精　鋼精的東西，不是鋼做的，而是鋁做的。</p>
<p>電木　電木的器具，不是木做的，而是石炭酸和甲醛在高熱高壓下凝縮而成的。</p>
<p>鉛粉　黑板上寫的鉛粉筆，不是鉛的粉末做成，而是炭酸鈣的粉末做成。</p>
<p>洋鉛皮　洋鉛皮是一張鐵皮，上而塗着一層錫或鋅，而不是一張眞鉛皮。</p>
<h3>水手辛白德傳（二七）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>每天有好久的時候我們到山上去，帶回一担担的象牙來，於是我們的貨房中巳積成許多堆了。要不是事實上因那鎭中人見我們天天載了那大批的齒牙回來，那我們還可多得些咧。</p>
<p>然而不多時，就被他們發見這些象牙是從那裏來的。一天我們上山去，遇見幾個人自許多騾兒在着，每一頭騾的背上載着一担死象的骨。</p>
<p>雖是如此，到得那船進口時，我已着實是個富人了。於是我揀定了一艘船，但在我動身之先，那買我作奴隸的人贈與我各種難得的東西。</p>
<p>我自然感謝他種種仁慈的行為，於是我們開船了。我們準時到了那地士大陸的一處港口中</p>
<p>我如今已瞧到海上生活的冒險，就打定主意在其餘的歸程中，不再把我的財貨託付於一艘船上。</p>
<p>我的辦法便是在印地士留住幾天，賣去我的貨物，得了大批的錢，便買了些奇怪難得的禮物帶去，又買了一頭牲畜以供坐騎，便由陸地回到我的故鄉去了。</p>
<p>我在路上很久，因為我得度過一大片的沙漠，內中是沒有樹木或水果生長的。我雖是忍受了好些事情而這種境地絕不能使我覺得愉快，可是我經歷已多，儘足以送我的性命，在我原不以為意的，如今得以脫身，滿懷充着謝意，末後我你回到巴克達了。</p>
<p>我立刻去見王，把我的經過報告他。他說我遠行已久，斷定我定是樂於回來的。我旣告知了他那象的故事，他以爲很奇怪，他說他要是不熟識我，那就要當這故事從頭到底全是不確實的了。</p>
<p>我旣告知了他一切，他就吩咐書記官將我所說的全用金字寫了下來，以便留給日後人民閱讀。</p>
<p>於是他給了我幾件禮物，合着我生平所得的許多貨物，便使我成了一個富了。</p>
<p>這才是我故事的結尾了。我不再雖家出去，和朋友們很安間的度我餘生。我得讚美上帝，因為他大大的保佑我。（完）</p>

<h3>法律與婦女</h3>
<p>— 珍妮</p>
<p>——關於林公子的豓事——</p>
<p>在封建的男權社會裏，一個有權勢的公子少爺，可以擁有三妻四妾，社會為之歌頌宣揚，法律則多方為之保護，現今時代雖已變遷，法律雖亦改進，但權勢者仍可以藐視法律，法律仍不能裁制權勢者的半根毫毛。</p>
<p>現在從本月一日起，所謂新刑法者，已實施了。其中與婦女有關係的二三九條，「有配偶而與人通姦者處一年以下有期徒　…」。是經過一　爭才成立的。正當新刑法實施開始的時節，却來了一件新鮮香　的趣聞。</p>
<p>最近兩日，中外各報，轟專去年才赴美求學的林京公子，目下愛上了美國某商店售貨女　　　女士，已於本日十八日正式結婚。</p>
<p>在這宗祧繼承法早已取消，　刑法又復巳實施的現在，林公子在國內旣有姊妹花的雙妻，在國外又復另結新娘。將來美國勃郎姑娘與國內的銀　少華兩女士（報載林公子先娶銀嚴，再婚少華，銀嚴少華為同胞姊妹）是否依法控告林公子，這些用不着我們關心，然而新刑法的二三九條，正可由林公子的事件做它的試金石。</p>
<h3>慈禧逃出京師的日子</h3>
<p>— 碧遙</p>
<p>一說到了七月二十一日，不由得要想起庚子年慈禧倉皇改裝奔出京城的那回事。一代貪權誤國，阻碍維新的魔物，到了國破城亡，不得不拋棄她那輝煌的金　寳　，穿着她所痛恨的漢　，雜在難民當中，星夜逃命。她所樹立的黨羽，　奔鼠竄；她所經營的　庫，撤手子而空。在這時，若還稍有人心，當只有悲傷悔恨之不暇。然而她，畢竟是魔物，是妖孽，死裏逃生之際，還不忘她的宿仇：她將戊戍政變那年，為袒護光緒而被她幽　州了的珍妃，臨時推死在井中。國仇可以放過，私恨却不媽虎；她全以這種豺狼的居心，把中國葬送了一半。</p>
<p>回想她自從咸二年（一八五二年）入宮以來，越四年而生同治，權勢遂蒸蒸日上。咸豐十年，京師陷於英法聯軍，她隨帝避難熱河，一切對外的主戰主和，對內的倚重曾國藩以攻太平軍諸大政，全由她居中裁决。不一年咸豐去世，她翦除許多異己的權貴。和溫厚的東太后垂廉聽政，實際大權完全在她手中；以後數十年間。她便儼然是獨裁的君主。奸謀詭計，殘害賢良，好大喜功，剛愎自用；羣小趨之若騖，政綱掃地無餘。外交旣已一再受辱，郤還將募來的海軍費用，移作修願和園之用。甲午戰一敗，受創不淺，正宜改革圖强，以救危亡於萬一。然而她，寗可國家抱在她手中夭亡，而不願放手給他人去醫治；於是放縱她那一批守舊的鷹犬，撲殺戊戍維新運動諸人。反動的舊勢力在她的羽翼下毛羽日新，迷頑愚昧地蠢動，遂至釀成庚子的大亂。洋人的軍火再度轟到北京，而罪魁的她竟沒有身首異處，總算給她的敎訓太少了！</p>
<p>這些雖是數十年前的往事，然而提起來時令人猶有新痛。</p>
<p>本來中國的婦女界，數千年中像她那樣獨攬政權的不過二三人。她的能獲得政權，自然要靠許多宵小的帮助；所以她登台以後的劣迹，自必受那班人的包圍，對她本人似該原諒幾分。可是她若稍稍可以算得是個人才，爲甚麽安心在那宵小橫行的朝廷上坐那實座呢？我們不能以女權主義者的眼光來擁護我們的同類放過她的滔天的罪孽。</p>
<p>目前國中沒有慈禧那樣的女賊，再談這些似乎是多事；可是為反動的舊勢力張目的女性，却正多於過江之　呢！有那讚揚舊禮敎的夫人，有那提倡婦德的太太，有那高唱新賢妻良母主義的奶妨，……眼看沒有多餘可以貽誤的垂危的國勢，還煽動牠走入窒息生命的古井之中！試看各種報章，那一天沒有「為夫不歡自　身死」，「寡婦被姦蓄意殉節」，「丈夫病故妻子墮樓」之類的新聞？這當兒，吃人的舊禮敎該如何努力打牠？然而帝國主義　和牠的合作者，已是沒奈何牠，連無力的舊禮敎也還爲牠捧塲，倒霉和愚昧到了甚麽田地！</p>
<p>七月二十一日曾給過擁護舊勢力的慈禧以當頭的棒喝，但不知這塲殘酷的紀念，可能多少警醒時人的迷夢？</p>
<p>婦女問題講座</p>
<h3>第四節「神聖的」一夫一妻制</h3>
<p>在資本主義社會，所有站在支配地位的人們都把一夫一妻制看作唯一神聖的結婚形態，而且用法律的及道德的規範來，把牠確立，並把牠神聖化。但是我們必須明白，這制度在本質上就是從財產私有制及男子把婦女奴隸化的社會關係中產生而發展的東西。就是說：「一夫一妻制到了大量的財富集中於一部分人的手裏——尤其男子的手裏，而且要把財富當作遺產而傳給男子的子孫，不願讓給任何他人的時候，才發生出來」（家族的起源）</p>
<p>所謂一夫一妻制的歷史的淵源是很久的。在古代希臘的社會已經有牠的萌芽形態，即有了一夫多妻制轉變為一夫一妻的一定　向。在那時候，一個男子在多數妻子中選定一個作為管理家政的主妻，同時使其餘的妻子從屬於主妻，這樣一方面可以有組織的處理家務，他方面可以克服一夫多妻制所必然引起的多數妻子間的反目。我國的主婦和妾乃是最好的實例。到了封建時代及商業資本主義時代，集中於個人手裏的財富，日益增大，這些財富的所有者為着保證把財富傳給他的法律上的子孫，更有加强一夫一妻制的必要，所以，在那時節，不論民法上或敎會法上都把牠當作神聖的制度而確立起來。再到資本主義時代，個人主義的財產私有制更見强大而强固，更有加强財產相續權的必要，所以，市民層雖努力剷除一切封建遺制，但祇這一制度則不單把牠保存，進而更使牠發揚光大，這種不變的，强制的一夫一妻制度，在工業資本主義時代，實巳發達到絕頂。</p>
<p>這樣，市民層是極端讚美一夫一妻制度的神聖而用種種的手　把牠保衛。可是實際上，這是使婦女作犧牲以强固男權支配的最不合理的制度。為什麽？因為第一在從來的法律上財產相續權只限於男子，第二所謂一夫一妻制是偏面的施行於婦女方面，而男子則隱然或公然地過一夫多妻制的生活。第三，一夫一妻制的結合本身，已經不是以純粹的性愛為前提，而是以婦女對男子的經濟的隸屬關係為前提。因此，在我們婦女的立塲看來，從來的所謂「神聖化」的一夫一妻制，乃是把婦女作為永久的奴隸，永久的犧牲品的男權社會的存在物。</p>
<p>有產者社會是一方面嚴守「神聖的」一夫一妻制而使婦女幽禁於這神聖的牢獄裏面，他方面設立公娼制度，以補充男子的多妻生活·特別在刑法中奸通罪上寬容男于而嚴罰婦女，結果被男子誘惑通奸的婦女，反受法律的　罰·這也是從來一夫一妻制的表徵。</p>
<p>從來的一夫一妻制是婦女的終身的奴隸化的契約·就是除了丈夫死亡或犯罪外永不得超脫的法律的枷銷。從來在法律上不准婦女對丈夫提出離婚的。這是强制的一夫一妻制的最主要的一環。</p>
<p>在法國大革命時代，市民層把婦女的離婚權利當作個人自由的主要因素，而在一七元二年九月國民議會所制定的法律中把牠承認了。但這法律到了拿破崙手裏全被推翻，在工業資本及金融資本主義時代，關於家族關係的一切立法，各國雖有多少差異，但大部分都以婦女的離婚禁止為其根本精神的。</p>
<p>現代意大利，西班牙及南美洲各國的法律都不准婦女提出離異。即使最自由主養的英美國家，在法律上雖規定這權利，但實際上婦女要提出離異時，須經過種種麻　的手續，　幾乎不能够實現的樣子。關於這種强制的，終身的一夫一妻制，一部分自由主義的男子們也出來反對，但他們都是站在男子的立塲去反對，這是更有趣的事情。反對者中的一人奧特馬爾克斯的反對理由如下：</p>
<p>「假定我對於我的鄰人，約定在今年十一月一日供給一百斛的馬　薯，那是因為我早就有了能够履行這種預約的原故。但是假使我約定從今天起到二十年後為止，祇愛一個女人，不　其他任何女人，那是等於簽字我自身所不能履行的契約……」。</p>
<p>這倒是眞話，資本主義社會，祇要你由錢，自實淫以至奸通，具備着種種一夫多妻生活的方便門。</p>
<p>我們對於十　　制　不是　　的　　、我們也曉得兩性的　　，并非　　　　　　物的本　，而是必須以個人的性愛為基礎，所以，一夫一妻制本身可以說是人類進化上兩性結合的最合理的形態。可是在私有財　男　　　　的　　，所謂純粹性愛的結合是絕無　　，而大多數都為經濟的利　所支配，一夫一妻　遂成了婦女的終身的賣淫契约。我們站在　女的立塲，不得不反對這種制度。</p>
<h3>美國電影所表現的女子職業問題</h3>
<p>— 伍衡</p>
<p>因爲一些偶然的機緣，在最近半倆月之內看了兩次初次在上海開映的影片，而且覺得很凑巧，這兩部影片所叙述的故事，又都說到了女子的職業問題。這兩部影片，第一部是克勞黛。考爾白主演的「心底相思（原名Private　Worlds），第二部是費蕾主演的「光榮的女性」（原名Am　Corver　Proffession）。</p>
<p>兩部片子所表現的都是職業婦人的「私生活」和她們的「職業」的衝突，結局，也都是女主人公的　去職務，而復歸到一個「生活在戀愛」中的女人；表現方法雖則多少的有些婉曲和率直的不同，但是在結論上否認婦女參加職業生活這一點，都完全是一樣的。</p>
<p>「心底相思」的女主人公是一個「會以戀人死於非命」而决定了　終生從事職業」的女醫，但是她和其他一個男醫生的》職業上」的合作，引起了這位男醫生的妻子的妬意，於是經過了傍綫的穿挿，悲劇便造成了，——在男醫生的妻子因為刺激過度而變成瘋狂之後，這醫院的院長開始對這「沒有費任的責任者」說敎了，他說·「你對他們倆的幸福是一種永遠的威脅，你和麥葛萊高（男醫）生活在一個莎麗（男醫之妻）所不能參加的世界，所以她妬嫉你，她要治好一個瘋狂的病人，來向她丈夫證明她租你一樣的聰明……現在，你所能做的唯一的合理的事，就是你狠快地跳出他倆的生活的圈子！」結果呢，這女醫終於帶淚地向她不願離開的聲院辭職了，她，和院長同樣地認為這是「唯一的合理的事」了。這，一方面表示了在一個曾經滄海的「唯願以解除人類苦痛爲職志」的女醫，她對於職業的　着心，還遠不及潛藏在她心底的那種消極的利他主義乃至「自己犧牲」（這是千百年來被認爲婦女唯一的美德的！）的觀念；在他方面，當然很明顯地表示了劇作的主見，他借一個「女性嫌惡者」的口吻說：「照我的經騐看，女子是不適宜於從事醫業的……」</p>
<p>第二部影片的華文譯名，我覺得實在是太諷刺了，，他說這是「光榮的女性」！故事　述一對大學畢業的夫婦，妻子因為她獨特的才智，很快的變一成了一個著名的律飾，丈夫却一時乘命　地祇當了一個建築工廠的職員，於是「家庭幸福，漸發生搖動，拔爾（夫）對於家一庭支出全由安痕（妻）負擔，久感難　，且安痕事務紛繁，在家庭的時間日少，……」，結果呢，丈夫有了外遇，更因這「外遇」的橫化而遭了逮捕，於是，照着「鬧劇」必有的徑路「安痕出庭為之辯護，向衆言，拔爾之離家，純由自己之不盡婦道，倘拔爾以此負罪，則罪名實應由伊負担，並聲明此後不再出庭，永與法律事業告別」！當然「拔爾卒獲無罪，尋在建築界　享盛名，安痕則致意持家，與拔爾共享甜愛之生活焉一了！</p>
<p>這兒的作意是交代得很明顯了，婦女職業，要妨害家庭幸福，而且因婦女從事職業而引起的男子的失德，都該山婦女負　　任，所以，婦女應該「致意持家」，以便「共享甜愛之生活」！不論這影片的編劇導演演員如何的高明，這種內容的陳腐和反進步性，是充分地可以引起有智識的覜衆的憤怒！說一句笑話，假使這影片的製作者不是猶太人的話，那到很可以由德國買去作為教育影片用的。</p>
<p>兩部影片的共同的特徵，是說明女子的不適宜於從事職業，她們應該附屬於男性，從屬於家庭，委曲她們的意志，抑制她們的才能，抹殺她們的個性，來維持一個以男性為中心的「幸福的家庭」！但是，儘管劇作家聰明，終還掩不了一點平凡的眞實，就是，這　部影片的女主人公，都有她們高貴的身分，前者是美國唯一的精神病學的醫生，後者是名震全國的律師，所以，當她們從職業戰綫告退下來之後，等待着她們的還有一個可以回去的「甜愛」而「幸福」的家庭，可是一方面，據我們知道，現在世界上大多數的職業婦女，却並沒有這樣一倏安全的「出路」！她們從事職業的理由，並不是為着榮譽，地位，野心，和與男子爭一日之短長的好勝的心理，使她們不能不從溫暖的「家庭」跑向爭透的職業的唯一的原因，祇是極平凡的「為着是要生活！」要生活，她們才從家庭裏面出來，要生活，她們才在精神和肉體上造成了一種可以和男性拮抗的資格，所以，在她們，實際上就和上而所說的兩位幸福的女主人公不同，她們不能勉強地「自己　牲」她們也沒有不必要的「自已苛責」，她們的哲學非常的簡單，她們要做的和能做的祇是一個人」所該做的本分而已。</p>
<p>我們覺得這兩位Herome的行為是一種心理上的「奢侈」！所以她們的「精神悲劇」並不是一般職業婦人所共有的。</p>

<p>——妹妹！你喝碗熱茶。………咳，你哥哥起初去的時候；說是住在洋火街，你住的地方同洋火街差多少路！」　嫂一手抱着幼子，還有兩個孩子跟在她的後面。</p>
<p>全房幾乎充滿着黑暗，只有一盞豆油燈亮着，燈火像螢虫樣大，燈草疲乏的躺在油盞中。</p>
<p>母親靠近燈檯，把燈草撥上些，火光稍亮一點照出母親的袖口邊。她坐下床沿，兩手挿進背心裏，喃喃地訴說：</p>
<p>——年紀愈老，做人愈苦。去年我生了病，你嫂　看也不來看我看，等到我睡在床上發熱發得很為，不能起身，你嫂嫂才抱着小孩進來；我以為她來照顧我了，那裏知道她一進來，開頭就是這麽一句話：『婆要！你心裏淸淸，你要曉得，你死了，我沒有錢給你拿出去哩」！母親忽流出眼淚，以粗老的手心拭着。</p>
<p>修珍　靜地坐在被窩　，默不作聲地聽着，時而想想滿積鼠糞的汚黑的帳頂，眼睛覺得疲乏萬分。又望望母親，想說幾句安慰的話，但是又說不出什麽來。只得默默坐着，再聽母親的訴說：</p>
<p>——我究竟是老啦，前次到廟裏去拜菩薩，不曉得怎麽樣跌了一交，你想我是走路都不中用呢。我的眼睛本來很好的，雖然年紀老，粗細針線還來得。可是自從你父親死後，我就天天哭着，這就壞了我的眼力。你想我哭什麼！我是哭我的口糧啊！你哥哥賺不了錢，你嫂嫂又是那麽兇，不懂理，……不過也難怪，拖了三個孩子，實在是够苦她的。我心裏悶着，流眼淚，因此我的左眼瞎了。苦！我的肉！母親忽然把左眼遮住『這樣我就看不淸東西，你在那邊，我見了好似一堆黑的什麼東西，分不出你的鼻子和眼睛，也看不出是一堆被窩還是一個人。她重把兩手挿進背心中，頭搖幾搖，表示出無限的嘆息。</p>
<p>修珍到這時又想安慰她，但是總是說不出一句最適當的話。後來不曉得怎　找出這麼一句來：</p>
<p>——大姊怎麽樣』？</p>

<h3>有無相通</h3>
<p>— 友泉</p>
<p>這裏所說的「有無相通」，不是世俗的所謂財富上的「有無相通」，而是哲學上的有無之槪念和相互關聯的問題。哲學上的有和無，從抽象的槪念來說，卽存在為有，不存在為無。在通常的觀念上，卽在人類之一般的直覺理解上，是把它們和實際的事物變化相割裂了的：有是純粹的，固定不變的有，是純有；無也是純粹的，固定不變的無，是純無。根據這種一般的有無槪念的理解，有無在抽象的意義上，是固定的也是不確定的，是同一的也是不能互相轉變而成為絕對對立的。因為當我們只抽象地想着某種存在，卽想着一個有，這在意象上是說它底內容常等於其自身，不能多也不能少，絲毫不可缺失。否則卽使是部分的减削或消失，但總是不原樣的存在着，不是原樣的有。所以這樣的有是固定的，永久等於其自身的。但這也只有在抽象的意義上可以這樣說，如果要把這樣的有放在現實事物上，卽要把它連接在具體事物上，則因具體事物是不絕地變化着，沒有絕無損益而永久同一的內容，所以這樣的有是不存在的。因為如此，所以那固定化了的抽象的槪念上的有，却正因為它的固定不變性，沒有和其自身相異的任何損益增减與差別，於是便不能在其中納入具體事物之內容，它只能以純抽象的內容泛指着意象上的有，這有便以此成為不確定的無現實內容的概念。反之，一般的所謂無的概念也是如此，無就是單純的空虛，是甚麽也沒有，其內容是純粹的無。它在無內容中完全永久等於其自身，不能增多或减少，甚至也不能變化。因為變化是必須變化出甚麼來的，若說無只是變化為無，這不過是無意義的詞句反覆，根本沒有意思。然而如無要成為有意義的變化，那麽就是要從沒有中產生出有，這就不是一般的所理解的無了。由此可知一般的抽象槪念上的無也是和有一樣，是固定的永久同一於其自身的。可是，這樣的無也是只能泛指一種抽象的純粹的槪念，不能和現實的具體事物相連接。因爲具體的現實事物是變化的，今天沒有的東西明天可以產生出來，從不存在之中產生出存在，從無轉變爲有，這是經常的現象。所以如要保持那絕對形式的無，也只有使它成為絕對的空虛，才能在任何普泛的塲合中都可以適用。這就是說抽象的無的絕對固定性的槪念，亦如抽象的有的槪念一樣，由其固定不變的永久同一性，同時成爲不確定的東西，因爲它不能有一個確定的具體現實內容。從這樣看來，抽象的無概念，它們也有共同一和對立。其同一之點，卽在於彼此均屬於一種固定的且不確定的空虛意象或槪念：其對立之點，卽在由於彼此都以固定性而成為不能互相轉變的絕對槪念，這便是一般的所謂有無的槪念。這樣的有無槪念，是絕對的不能相通的概念，在它們的抽象與空虛的意義上，是不能有現實的適用性的。</p>
<p>那足以說明現實與具體事物的有無的槪念，它們雖然也是對立的，但其對立不是絕對的，而是能互相轉變的；是彼此互相形成而相通的，中間沒有永久不可踰越的鴻溝。完全離開現實的具體的事物而談有無，這種絕對空虛的有無是無意義和不可理解的。因為我們要怎樣才能說明一個有呢？這是必須要有現實的存在物，有具體的事物存在的。沒有一切現實而具體的事物，有的槪念根本就不能發生。在絕對空虛的宇宙中，我們不但不能談有談存在，也不能證明有和有存在。然而，如果沒有任何的有，我們亦不能想像出一個無，因爲宇宙間根本就甚麽也沒有，我們又如何能在有的對立方面去想像和證實有一個無呢？反之，我們又要怎樣才能去說明一個無呢？這是必須要那現實的具體事物之在存在中有不存在，今天存在着的事物，到了明天那原封原樣的事物就消滅了，不存在了，所以這無的槪念地才發生了。如果宇宙中的事物永久都只是那樣存在着，它沒有任何消失，卽完全沒有無它的時候，在這絕對固結和充實的宇宙中我們不但不能談無談不存在，也不能證明有無有不存在。然而如果完全沒有無，我們亦同樣不能想像出一個有，因爲宇宙中根本就無所謂無，我們又如何能在無的對立方面去想像和證實有一個有呢？由此看來，則有是對待於無而成立的，無也是對待於有而成立的，要有有才能形容出一個無，也要有無才能形容出一個有；有的存在是同時包含着無而存在的，無的存在也同時包含着有而存在的。對立的兩極常要在對立物的並存中才能存在，這正如陰陽電磁極的互相依存而存在，沒有正電磁極卽無負電磁極，沒有負電磁極亦無正電磁極，沒有拒力卽無引力，沒有引力亦無拒力，沒有勢能便無動能，沒有動能亦無勢能等等對立物的相形相依而成一樣。</p>
<p>不但如此，有無都須依存於物質而存在，因為物質的變化是產生有無的必要情件。然而物質是不絕地變化的，這變化是從有推移到無，從無惟移到有，固此有就直接由物質的變化作用生出無，無亦就直接由物質變化作用生出有。事實是理論的證明，太陽系不是亘古就有的，它在成立以前是無，然而太陽系亦不是憑空生出來的，卽不是從絕對空虛中生出來，它是原始星雲形成起來的。這就是說，星雲消滅了，太陽系產生了，星雲消滅是由有走到無，卽由有產生無，而太陽系產生是由無走到有，卽由無產生有。然而由星雲之消滅歸於無星雲，由無太陽系生出有太陽系，卽由有生無與由無生有，都不是物質絕對消滅而只是變化，也不是由絕對空虛生出有來而仍只是物質變化，所以有無只在物質變化上互相推移，相通相成。物質變化使已存在的消滅，也要有存在才有消滅，這是由有生無，是要有有才能生無。物質變化使原來沒有的生長起來，也要原來沒有它才有所謂新生，這是由無生有，是要有無才能生有。沒有消滅就沒有生長，沒有生長也沒有消滅，於是在無生有和無包含着有，有生無和有包含着無中，不但使有無成為隨時對立的，而且也要在對立中才能存在，更要在有無的交替循環發展下才有宇宙萬物，有無以此不是絕對對立不相通的。它們在對立的統一中生長着世界一切，它們也在物質的變化中建立立己的對立的統一基礎。</p>

<p>名人訪問記</p>
<h3>應雲衛</h3>
<p>— 俞少棠</p>
<p>在藝華的導演室裏，橫七豎八擺着十多張富麗的寫字檯；每一張檯子上都有一塊稜形的藍底白字的搪磁牌子，上面鐫着每一位導演的名字。</p>
<p>一陣梯梯達達的急促的皮鞋聲傳了進來。</p>
<p>「應大導演來了！」那幾個正在寫字的，其中有一個笑了。</p>
<p>「聽聽他響亮的皮鞋聲，的確不愧是一位「時勢英雄」呢！」又一個接着說。</p>
<p>「哈哈……」這句話逗着滿室的人都笑了。</p>
<p>「不要太够味了吧？」正在大家笑得不可開交的當兒，導演室的門口露出了一副白晳的面孔，笑喀嘻地兀自立着；一動也不動地儘望着許多笑容還不曾歛去的面孔。過了一會，大槪是發現了他寫字檯旁邊還有我這一個陌生的人在坐着等候他，這才歛住了笑容走了進來，隨手把一本很厚的劇本望機子上一放，謙遜的朝着我招呼說：「這就是×先生？嘿！天氣這麽熱，要你勞駕到這兒來實在不敢當。」他操着流利的普通話，像唸台辭似的說着；白晳的面孔上又展開了剛才的歡笑。</p>
<p>「很久以前就想來訪問應先生，可是總沒有機會；最近聽說你又導演了一部「時勢英雄」，因此就趁這機會來參觀一下。」</p>
<p>「說參觀可不敢當，假使有機會的話，希望能多多的指敎；不過今天的戲因佈景還沒搭起來，恐怕會使你失望的。」他表示很抱歉似的說。</p>
<p>「這倒沒有什麽要緊，以後參觀的梭會還多着；」我連忙搶着說：「不過應先生過去從事戲劇和電影的生活，今天有沒有工夫可以告訴我？」</p>
<p>「假如你要知道的話，當然是可以盡量的奉告；不過我自己總覺得沒有什麽可以値得說的。」他說話的神情裏是充滿了戲的成份；有時他那種輕鬆幽默的表情，會使人見了忍不住要笑的。</p>
<p>「應先生從事戲劇生活，到現在恐怕有很多年了吧？」我覺得這種問法很是幼稚；不過不這樣提出一個頭緒來，却會使他感到一種無從說起的困難的。</p>
<p>「我最初對於戲劇感到興味是在「五四」運動發生那一年；那時我祇有十六歲，在×中學裏讀書。一般靑年同學的思想，在那種偉大運動的漩渦中，自然是免不了要跟着轉變；於是新的文藝和戲劇，便成為一般靑年們的愛好了。」</p>
<p>「應先生當時自然也是愛好戲劇的一個囉？」我搶着替他補充一句說。</p>
<p>「是的，」他笑着：「不過那時還沒有正式演戲。當時國家的環境也和現在差不多的惡劣，一般覺醒的靑年學生都感到了國難日深，不喚起民衆是不足以解救當前的危機；於是各學校的靑年學生都紛粉出動，廢寢忘食的到各處演講。記得有一次在靑年會化裝演講，我扮演一個「壞蛋」，被聽衆飽打了一頓，嗣後就不敢再扮演這類的角色了。但那次的被打却給予了我對戲劇一種新的認識；我開始覺得戲劇感應力的强大，有時竟能使觀衆忘了自己。……到後來想做戲的興趣愈加濃厚，祇要學校裏一有機會演戲，總不會缺少我這個角色的。」</p>
<p>「應先生的個性是適宜於演那一種的角色哩？」</p>
<p>「那時演戲是談不到個性的適合不適合的，祇要你歡喜扮演什麽就是了；不過有許多人總不肯扮演女的，所以遇到有這種角色，總是我來包辦。後來中華職業擊校第一次演出「英雄與美人」，我便因了在學校裏扮演女人有點名氣的緣故，就被邀到道次公演裏扮了一個女人的角色；這是我第一次正式上舞臺演話劇，結果算是博得了一點較好的批評。」</p>
<p>「以後對於戲劇的興趣想是更加大了？」我笑着說。</p>
<p>「何消說呢？不過後來不僅單為增進自己對話劇的興趣，並且還要想出許多方法使愛好話劇的人增多；無論那個學校裏開游藝會，我總是義務的去替他們排演。每一次游藝會公演的結果，總得着不少的好評；因此後來各學校的當局便對話劇特別地注意了，祇要有游藝會舉行，總也有表演話劇的節目。」得意的笑容又在他臉上展開了。</p>
<p>「應先生在話劇的歷史上是有很大的功績的。」我凑趣的說。</p>
<p>「有功績的話是不敢當，不過我對於戲劇旣感到興趣，所以不妨「推己及人」，希望能在戲劇上多盡點力罷了。可是，當時為了從事戲劇的活動，的確是受了不少的刺激；因為那時的演戲，不僅舞台上的技術談不上，就連一個較好的劇本也是沒有的，一般學校的遊藝會演戲多半是只有慕表而沒有劇本，一般演員表現的技巧也比現在的文明戲還不如。所以當時歡喜看戲的人固然很多，但因技巧太低能的緣故，致令觀衆對話劇演員都當作「戲子」似的瞧不起。我那時在許多演員中是比較出名的一個，所以一般親友都對我不滿。為了我要演戲，我現在的妻子曾對我提出離婚的要求，工作的機關也曾把我革職，但失戀，失業的打擊還是不能把我從戲劇的路上拖回來。」他握緊着拳頭在空中畫了半個圖圈，表示非常堅决的樣子。</p>
<p>「可是，應先生那時演戲還換不到麵包，個人的生活又是怎樣維持的哩？」我緊逼着問。</p>
<p>「我出了學校以後，曾一面做事，一面從事戲劇活動，所以生活倒不必躭心。不過我剛才說過，有一個時期，為了人們不了解戲劇的偉大，我是被迫得失業的。在那失業的期間，物質的生活上自然是感到了極度的重壓，可是精神的生活上倒反而减少了許多的痛苦。不久話劇在社會上的地位遂漸的提高，而我的職業問題也就在這時解决了。這一次服務的機關是肇興輪船公司；以一個喜歡演戲的人去經營航業，像是有點不倫不類，一般人也預料我會做不下去，可是事情是當會出人意外的，我以演戲的精神去為公司服務，竟然在那裏度過了十幾個寒暑，直到去年我正式加入電影界才宣告脫離了航業生活。</p>
<p>「話劇現在能够在社會上佔到相當勢力，還是應歸功於當日一般從事戲劇運動的人的努力，因為那時話劇的社會環境雖然惡劣，可是他們仍不顧一切的往前苦幹。後來洪深由美國回來，加入戲劇協社排演「潑婦」，「好兒子」，又開了戲劇上的新紀錄，開始有了劇本演戲；而且他又是以一個留學生的地位來從事戲劇，因此社會對戲劇的觀念也就與前大不相同了。還有一件使人驚詫的事，就是從那時起，錢劍秋等一班女同志也居然大胆的加入了戲劇協社；錢劍秋在洪深導演的「潑婦」中飾一女角色，公演以後在技巧上是成功了。我在這班女同志加入後，飾女角色算是無形的取消；但是後來大家又發覺了要使話劇眞實化，舞台的裝置是非常重要的，從那時起，我便從前台演劇而變為幕後的「監督」了。接着又有歐陽予倩編導的「少奶奶的扇子」和「愧儡家庭」，都曾哄動一時，在技巧上也有相當的成就。我第一次導演的劇，是與洪深聯合導演的「第二夢」；過了不久，洪深，歐陽予倩都先後因事離開戲劇協社，以後的戲差不多都是由我導演了。」</p>
<p>「在應先生近演的戲當中，要算那一劇最成功？」</p>
<p>「這可不敢說。……」他又哈哈地笑了：「不過我自己認為滿意的，還是替一般女學校裏導演的戲佔多數；至於在舞台公演的，大概「怒吼罷，中國！」要算是較好的一劇了。」</p>
<p>「應先生加入電影界，就是從導演了「怒吼罷，中國！」那時開始的罷？」</p>
<p>「不，其實在導演這個戲以前，就有不少的朋友勸我加入電影界，但一方面因為我服務的航業公司不願我離開，一方面我也希望從事藝術不必一定要職業化，所以就沒有接受朋友們的善意。等到「怒吼罷，中國！」演出以後，許多朋友又勸我還是加入電影界，都以為這樣做了，可以有很多的發揮自己個性的機會，同時十幾年的航業生活我也感到有點厭倦，因此就加入了新興的電影組合的藝華公司了。在進藝華不久，便編好了一個劇本，但因同時開拍的戲太多，玻璃棚不够用，我就祗好閒着；凑巧電通公司在這時崛起了，於是由那邊和藝華商量，讓我先替他們導演一部「桃李刧』。這部片子出來以後，雖然博得一部分人的讚賞，但還是得力於一般演員的盡力，我自己却沒有什麽功勞可以自傲的。』</p>
<p>「導演「桃李劫」的報酬也可以公開麼？」我笑着說。</p>
<p>「這有什麽不可？」他做着滿不在乎的手勢搶着說：「這部片子的導演費是一千二百元。」</p>
<p>「最近在導演的「時勢英雄」的報酬也有這麼多麼？」</p>
<p>「不，這裏是講月薪的，每月一百八十元，如果片子賺了錢，還可以拿點酬勞。」</p>
<p>「那麼應先生的生活是很舒服的囉？」我開頑笑似　問。</p>
<p>「舒服也說不上，我以為在航業公司也還可以賺這麽多的錢的；不過我加入電影界倒並不是貪牠的薪水大呢！」他也笑了。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<h3>鐵與人類</h3>
<p>— 古北軒</p>
<p>鐵對於人類非常重要。首先，從人類的生理上來說，每一個靑年人的赤血中就有百分之〇·二是鐵質：假使一個人身體內鐵質缺少或者沒有時，那他的皮膚不僅會沒有血色，而且連生命也是不能保存的。許多醫生和科學家之所以常勸我們多喫菠菜和別的一些菜蔬，便是因為其中包含鐵質最多的緣故。鐵質，可說是人類身體中不可缺少的最重要的一個原素。其次，在現代人的一般生活中，鐵也是非常重要的。假使沒有鐵，我們不僅不能製造火車輪船飛機汽車，使我們無法敏捷地行動；而且還不能縫衣，製菜與建築房屋，以致衣食住都發生問題。由此，我們又可以說鐵是我們生活中萬不可少的東西，沒有它，我們簡直不能生活。但是，假使你有一點人類進化史的知識，那你一定會知道我們的最遠的祖先是並不知道宇宙間還有鐵的；就是已經有了相當進化的遊牧民族，其生活也與鐵毫無關係，他們所用的一切器眞都是用石製成的，所以歷史家稱他們的時代為石器時代。</p>
<p>經過了石器時代之後，人類才漸漸地知道了用金屬來製造武器和一切器具。但最初被人類發現的還不是鐵，而是靑銅。所謂靑銅，乃是錫與銅的混合物；靑銅的發見並被人類用來做武器等物的事情，據一般歷史家的推測，乃是遊牧民族在經常的戰爭中為要改良武器所引起的。至於人類之以鐵來製造工具，乃是在銅器時代之後。據威爾斯的推測，鐵之最初使用者亦為遊牧民族，這推測的依據，當然也是在遊牧民族於不斷戰爭中心須日益改進其武器一事上的。</p>
<p>從鐵礦中掘出來的鐵，以現在我們的常識來說，，必須要在火中經過一定的鍜鍊才好。但人類知道用火來鍊鐵的事情却也不很容易。據一般歷史家的推測，首先是由於火山的爆發，很自然地使山中所藏的鐵經過火的鍜鍊，於是人類才知道了用火鍊鐵的事情，才開始用木材木炭去鍜鍊生鐵。在最初的時候，人類還沒有鎔鐵爐，所以只好在山間挖一個洞，將本炭放在其中燃燒，隨着才將鐵放進去鍜鍊，這樣，洞中的風力不足，火力有限，鍊出來的鐵當然是不很好的。後來由於生活的需要，人類才發明了簡單的鎔鐵爐和風箱，於是人類才能漸漸地用鐵來製造一般工具，才由石器時代，銅器時代進化到了鐵器時代。</p>
<p>已經進化到了鐵器時代的人類，才漸漸地明白了鐵是一切金屬中對於人類最有益的材料。它可以任意引長，任意彎曲，任意弄成硬或軟的東西；它可以做鐵條，鐵絲，鐵針，鐵刀，鐵槍……等類東西。對於工業，農藝，美術，科學，戰爭，鐵都是極重要的。因此，鐵的用途日多，需要日切，固有的初期的採鐵方法與鍊鐵的鎔鐵爐，就日益顯示其不能適用了。於是在十六世紀之際，德國的製鐵業者卽將原有的鎔鐵爐加以改造，成為更高更大而且將爐口關閉着的鎔鐵爐；又至十六世紀之末，又有人再將此種鎔鐵爐加以改進，才使之脫離了原始的形態。但是，鍊鐵的燃料原是木炭，因為鐵的需要日多，鍊鐵技術日益進步，這種鍊鐵的燃料就日益缺乏起來。在十七八世紀的歐洲，因為急需燃料，許參森林都被採伐了；英國在十八世紀的初期，為要防止地方森林的全滅，甚至在議會中决議了限制製鐵的法案。這樣，經過了一個時期之後，在一七三五年英國的製鐵業者達彼才試用煤來作燃料，結果是收到了很好的成績，於是木炭才被煤從鎔鐵爐中驅逐出去了。以後英人萊爾孫又將製鐵法大加改革，並發明了吹送熱風於鎔鐵爐內的法則。由此刺激起了鐵的產額大量的增加，鐵的生產技術也日益發展，什麽鐵橋，鐵道，鐵管，輪船，火車等等近代的製造品便逐漸出現了，所謂近代文明的基礎便也由是奠定。</p>
<p>隨着人類社會的進化，在十九世紀的中葉，伯慈塞馬氏又發明了製鋼的新法。鋼，不過是包含了少量的炭素的鐵，在伯慈塞馬以前，本來人類就已知道了如何鍊鋼的，不過所用的方法不精良，而且也不普遍，自伯慈塞馬的製鋼法出世以後，製鐵事業才日益普遍發展起來。及至一八五八年，他又發明了所謂伯慈塞馬的轉爐，從此製鐵製鋼業更得到了大大的發展，對於人頻的生活也發生了至大的作用。不說別的，只要看現刻各國所有的戰艦，坦克車等殺人利器，差不多都是鋼鐵製成的；若沒有鋼鐵，恐怕許多奇妙，利害的東西我們還見不着吧。</p>
<p>以上便是人類與鐵的關係之史的發展的一個簡單的過程。由此我們不僅可以看到鐵對於人類的重要，而且從進化的觀點看來，還可以說人類過去的進化是隨着人類之征服鐵物的進展而進化的</p>
<p>到現在為止，我們可以說，一個國家之强弱，富貧及其文明稈度之高下是與其產鐵額成正比例的。大家知道，美國是資本主義最發達的國家，但據一九二九年的統計，全世界銑鐵的產額為九六一八萬噸，其中美國就佔了一三一〇萬噸，居世界第一位；鋼鐵的總產額為一一八〇〇萬噸，其中美國就佔去了五五〇〇萬噸，約佔全數之半。此外現今世界各先進國，如德法意日，如蘇俄，其鋼鐵業都是很發展的。至於我國，素稱「地大物博」，產鐵也很豐當，如江蘇，湖北，四川等省，都埋藏着大量的鐵產，但不幸的是因為我國工業不發展，埋藏在國土內的大量的鐵產還未能開採出來；卽或已開採出來的，其主權又大多操在外人之手，對於本國不僅無益，抑且有害。如果我們要迎頭趕上世界各先進國家，便須從外人手中將喪失了的鐵礦權和別的一切權利奪取回來，將未開發的鐵礦和別的一切重要礦產開發出來，走上現代的新鐵器時代，更進而飛躍到科學的電器時代。</p>

<h3>升學指導</h3>
<p>— 遴先</p>
<p>敎師及畢業生家長座談會</p>
<p>敎師：諸位好幸福，令郎令媛都再這學期畢業樂。我應當向諸位先致祝賀之意。</p>
<p>貧窮的家長甲：有什　可賀的呢？你只應當去賀那般眞正有福氣的孩子們的家長—有福氣的孩子，他們有家產富裕的爹媽，他們畢業了，他們的爹媽會替他去揀一個辦理完善的中學，讓他去升學。也許孩子們在領到畢業文憑之後，還可向慈愛的爹媽領取另外好吃好玩的獎品呢！然而我的孩子——</p>
<p>敎師：我們在現在自然也無須去夢想資產階級的生活，然則你對於你的孩子以後有什麽方針沒有呢？</p>
<p>家長甲：那里去談方針？有方針就得有錢。</p>
<p>敎師：……</p>
<p>家長甲：　孩子以後怎樣呢？是的，孩子以後應當怎樣呢？升學吧，你看像我這個做窮爺娘的人，連一家衣食都有不繼之虞，那有力量使孩子升學？呌他學手藝吧，做學徒吧，年紀不足十二三，我那孩子身材又那麽矮小，立不上櫃台，揑不得斧頭，並且沒有好親</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>好眷，有誰作薦做保？唉，唉，養兒容易敎兒難！</p>
<p>敎師：甲先生，我想先生還不必說這些話吧。做爹媽的人自然只有為兒女負責任，盡義務，並且父母唯一的天責就是敎育！令郎又天資聰頴，實在應當去好好造就他，將來不難出人頭地的。</p>
<p>家長甲：說笑話啦！父母的天責，我是明白的，但幾年來，接着市面不景氣，田地又種不出好春熟，人亂又天荒，這年頭不搬債已算是上上好年成，手頭還有什麽餘錢去栽培孩子讀書！</p>
<p>敎師：照你說來，你的孩子不升學，又無門路去就業，眞是畢業反而害了他，眞是始料所不及！好吧，我們等一下再想辦法吧！乙先生，你的少君大槪一定要找一個中學去造就造就了！</p>
<p>頑固的家長乙：升學也沒多大意思吧！李應彪家大兒子不是化了幾千塊錢在北京什麽有名大學畢業了麽？但是，你看，不還是在家里吃老米飯嗎？我是看穿了的，並且我家孩子年齡也大了，今年十七歲了，家里人手少，他祖母母親都想替他找一門親事，現在東村王家送來一個「帖子」，李家也有一個「月生」，若命里通，我想定好一頭親事，做爹媽的也算是了却了一樁心事。</p>
<p>敎師：乙先生錯了，大學畢業出來並不是說一定就有職業，並且形式上的畢業並不能决定有沒有眞本領，有了本領，是不是有人需要，也很成問題的，並且在我們中國，眞正的人才無處銷納，考試還未許遍，學非所用，甚至人才埋沒的事實，也確實到處皆是。但我們决不能就因此而因噎廢食。剛剛我說過，父母對兒女的敎育，僅僅是一種應盡的義務，雖然我們應該好好指導兒一女走正當的途徑，但做父母的，實在但知耕耘，不能去問收穫的！我覺得乙先生的觀念錯了，父母的天責是敎育，兒女的婚姻却用不着做爺娘的去干涉，婚姻是兒女自己的事情，等他們年齡大了，他們自己自然會去解决的。</p>
<p>家長甲：×先生說得不錯·乙先生，你不要不相信×先生的話。講到兒女的婚姻對於做爹娘的自然也是一件够麻煩的事，據說現在新法律上就規定「婚烟以當事人自主為原則」，父母之命媒妁之言已不復通行了，况且你不見彭愼甫家兒子為了婚姻問題，閙得天翻地覆嗎？做爹娘的又何苦去話受罪！我的主意以爲，乙先生家境好，儘應當讓你令郎去升學，並且你旣有錢為令郎辦喜事，不如暫把這筆錢供給你家令郎上學去！我，不瞞先生說，心有餘而力不足，唉！我的孩子那有先生的孩子福氣好！只恨我自己不爭氣，苦了自己，還害了兒女的……</p>
<p>敎師：對了，甲先生的意見不錯！……現在我們要聽聽丙先生的意見了。</p>
<p>兒女成羣的家長丙：承好意徵及我的意見，不瞞諸位說，我共有子女七人，四男三女，大兒二兒在大學念書，三女四兒五兒在中學念書，除七女尙在初小求學外，六女今年小學畢業了，然而我全年為兒女負祖的敎育費已超過千元以上，眞是應了「為兒女作牛馬」這一句話了。六女，我想就讓她在家裏操作家務，一來女人家對家庭工作也應相當的練習，二來我也可以透一口氣，三來女孩兒家不比男孩子，讀了書也未必見得作女官辦公事，一嫁了男人，還不是陪丈夫，養兒子，就完了嗎？並且多讀了書，別的不長進，眼界倒放大了，家庭操作的事，倒不幹了，所以我眞為我的三女担心事，不曉得這娘兒可也如此？</p>
<p>家長甲：丙先生能敎養六七個大小孩子，我就連一個孩子都無九敎育他，慚愧慚愧！</p>
<p>敎師：甲先生也無須灰心；丙先生的話，我們也値得討論。丙先生指出女予敎育的弱點，甚佩卓見；所以我覺得女子敎育是否應和男子教育一樣辦，甚至現在一般貴族式的女子學校是否合理，都値得鄭重研究，但原則上我覺得男女的敎育機會總應該均等的，男子可愛高深的敎育，女子又何嘗不可呢？丙先生的負祖之重，我個人深表同情，但以為女子不必受一般男子一樣高深的敎育，那我却不以為然。</p>
<p>家長乙：誠然，丙先生的經濟能力還能够負担，在責任上講，令媛還是以深造為是</p>
<p>家長丙：子女……太多……周旋不…來……</p>
<p>敎師：子女多了，父母的責任就愈重了！不過——</p>
<p>家長甲：不是當丙先生面前說不中聽的話，像你丙先生多生幾個子女倒還沒什麼，一般無能力的爺娘才不負責任，他們也是毫無節制的生了大羣兒女。社會現無公育的辦法，他們就旣不養，更不敎，終日流浪街頭，將來無非都是社會的累贅。</p>
<p>敎師：所以我覺得在下層社會中，節慾的學說還值得提倡和宣傳呢！……丙先生，我以為令媛的前途也是光明的，一個人的智職，愈高愈好！</p>
<p>家長丙：我同意，男女敎育的機會確不應偏視的，但我以為小女應學一種應用的實際技能，現在一般學校的功課太空泛了，×先生以爲然否？</p>
<p>敎師：是。</p>
<p>家長丙：甲先生的令郎也應升學去，我們應大家想法帮助甲先生盡一點力。</p>
<p>敎師及家長乙：當然，當然，我們不但應帮助甲先生的令郎，我們還應該帮助一切有天才的有前途的兒童！</p>

<h3>黑白社三屆影展觀後</h3>
<p>— 徐心芹</p>
<p>這幾天起初是陰雨不時的，間或又放晴，或者又是酷熱；但我們却可常常看到千變萬化的夏雲的奇姿，和燦爛如錦的晚霞。如果有機會到郊外去，便是葱蘢的叢樹夾道笑迎着人；水田裏一片片靑苗也怪可愛的。然而，為了衣食所擊，仍然免不了大夥兒的職業羣聚集在都市中，甚至大多數人不能稍得游息的閒暇。這其間，雖然也有時煩囂逼人的夜花園，而大家都當牠是唯一舒暢身心的目的地了。還有，便是藉藝術手腕而再現出陶冶性情，慰藉苦悶的意境；如電影，舞臺劇，美術性質的展覽會等。</p>
<p>前幾天，我為黑白攝影社所揭示的幾張動人興味的廣告所吸引，很興奮地跑到大陸商塲六樓北部去參觀。這一處展覽會塲有三面全是窗，透亮的居高臨下，竟使人忘了是在「處處樓臺掩斜陽』的上海了。加以佈置的合宜，設備的樸質簡凈，處處給參覜者以暢快的感覺，所以便留連着好些人，個個都有徘徊不忍遽去的情况。</p>
<p>全場陳列的攝影計共二百六十八張。據說係由該社全體社員集合作品一千四百餘點裏面，嚴格檢選出來的。該社現有社員八十九人；得陳列出品者五十八人。個人陳列最多者有三十七幅，最少者僅一幅。每一出品均附有簽條，上面說明用何種鏡箱拍攝，用何種紙張晒印，大可作為觀摩研究的借鏡。</p>
<p>全部作品仍以風景佔最多數，大自然的風光已經是很値得欣賞了；再加以藝術手腕的剪裁，使角度適宜之更烘托駢一張張動人的畫面。如張景琠君的「松蔭古剎」，華懷屺君的「山輿』，蘇錦元君的「豐年之兆」，盧施福君的「大好山河」，「滿載而歸」，盧馥君的「關山一曲萬里輕舟」，丁陞保君的「山雨欲來」</p>
<p>王勞生君的「雲海蒼茫」，向慧菴君的「暮色」，敖恩洪君的「月夜江尖」，徐德先君的「西沈」，周誦先君的「潺潺」陳傳霖君的「塔前垂柳泛孤舟」「陽銜山」，葉淺予君的「落葉」，聶光地君的「孤舟夜月」，羅靜予君的「廬山風雲」，羅穀蓀君的「橋樑」，司徒懷君的「漁光曲」等，碰到的景緻時間和攝影的經騐，幾下裏一凑，便凑成一幅幅使人神往的作品。其次便是人像和以人物為中心的作品：如吳印咸君的「待吻」，葉淺予君的「船孃」，盧馥君的「禾田」，沈毓炳君的（不覊之才」，陳傳霖君的「偕歸」陳　德君的「千鈞一髮」，「靑春的活躍」，丁陞保君的「首途」，向慧庵君的「蛟龍身手」，王珏君的「洗菜」，王鈺槐君的「美目倩兮」，胡潤生君的「迎神賽會」，計鶴鳴君的「捕魚」陳謹詩君的「勞動之窟」，羅靜予君的「聽訓」，盧施福君的「擱淺」等，看了使我們覺得這人間的現象，着實變幻莫測，也着實可以大題小做，小題大做，更覺得在藝術中反映着的人生是更有趣味，更深刻的。以花草鳥獸虫魚作題材的如吳中行君「燕侶鶯儔」，「虎視」，「烏雀南飛」，毛松友君的「優遊自得」，聶光地君的「烏山之舞」司徒博君的「鶴舞」等，大約都靠了隨處留心，機會凑巧，所謂「文章天成，妙手偶得之」吧？但若非運用得法，定會失之交臂哩！</p>
<p>有幾幅很特殊的作品，那便要歸功於作者胸中的邱壑，和思想的敏捷了：如王鈺槐君的「大地分畛域」，丁陞保君的「傘，傘，傘」，王朋哲君的「樓高人杳」，王鈞賢君的「嗚笛」，卞芷湘君的「酒」，吳印咸君的「泡影」，崔鼎君的「荷錢」，姚仲魯君的「十室九空」，桂季盈</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>君的「機械」，徐雁影君的「亦有絃音」黃崇葉君的「幻影」，陳傳霖君的「稍縱卽逝」，陳謹詩君的「怒放」，葉淺予君的「歌衫」，盧施福君的「出水芙蓉」，盧毓君的「連續交錯」，聶光地君的「梯」等等。</p>
<p>我記得作品中有好些已經在一些岡畫刋物上早見過，只是製版後總有些兩樣，這次能够看見原作，覺得十分欣幸。但我除了表示嘆服之外，還要附帶貢獻些意見：（一）我覺得目下中國的攝影藝術剛在萌芽滋長，多少有興趣的人苦於無經騐和指導，所以希望每次攝影展覽會要帶些指導後進的意味，每一作品必須註明當時時間，快門度數，若能附原作—指未放大之原來小尺寸晒印出者於其旁更好。（二）附未加剪裁的原作，與如何剪裁及剪裁之原因的說明；自然，有時一張攝影，全部和局部都是可取的。</p>
<p>固然，每個研究藝術的人應該多量發展個性—天賦的才能和經騐，智慧的積蓄，但不妨公諸大衆以作指導及偕鏡。</p>
<p>以上的觀感，我自知淺陋得很，我也只有引用黑白社特刋上所揭示的「地奈保氏之言」作為藉口了：「鑑賞的才能就是理解和認識，但理解底深淺，認識底廣大，祗憑鑑賞者各個的才能！」</p>
<p>黑白社的前途當然是更有進境的，我們希望它更能普遍使大衆理解和認識它更深切些，這也是黑白社應盡的責任—如同整個藝術界的責任一樣。</p>
<p>專述</p>
<h3>華僑在全世界（三）</h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>「巴達維亞，摩羅加，安洨及萬蘭丹各島人口，皆有增加之必要。復宜予以資財，始能冀其為國生利。世界民族，最適吾人使用者，莫如華人。通商旣不能以和平而致，極應趁此信風期，令戰艦窺伺中國，擄其男女及小兒而歸；如與中國開釁，尤宜留意擄其丁口，婦女及小孩尤佳，用以實吾島屬。如來取贖，沒人索流失唎（Ryals），然婦女則不准取讀，或離開公司管轄之外。」</p>
<p>在這樣的意見中，我們可以看到一部份南洋等地的中國人，是應了別人的急需增加勞力與人口而去的。於此我們可以說：歐美各先進國乃×××之殖民世界，是偽了侵略，中國一部份僑民之走刀世界各處去，乃是偽了應它們的侵略的需要的；它們是老板，我們是工人，是店員。</p>
<p>不錯，如南洋一帶的華僑，有許多是在歐美人士還未到來之前就在那裏的，而且在開發那些地方的富源中，還有很大的成績。前海峽殖民地總督瑞天咸（Frank　Swettenbam）曾說「華僑開發馬來半島未開發之富源」；又說：「白人未至馬來半島以前，華人已在該地開礦，捕魚，經商，務農矣。白人旣至，草創之初，全賴華人財力，得以平治道路，大興土木。行政之費，胥在於是。華人首探各礦，至今猶然。率皆伐山斫木，深入莽叢，冒危險以護大利，然濕熱中人，死者無算。又能為冶工，為樵夫，為建築家。凡公署，橋梁，鐵路，皆出其收。又能投巨資於此島，為歐仁所不敢為。又善經商，設輪船公司，以通馬來各埠。又能招致工人前來，開發天然富源。政府就而稅之，佔收入十分之舊。凡一事旣成，宜知其成功之所在，讀斯文者，應知華人之有造於馬來各國為何如也。」於此可見華僑在馬來半島的歷史與地位了。</p>
<p>但是，就是那些在白種人尚未到南洋來而就到了那兒的華僑，其在開發南洋中雖有極大的功績，但自白種仁的勢力侵入後，他們的地位就一天一天地低落了：而且，他們還只是華僑中的極小部份，世界各地的大多數的華僑還是歐美資本主義的發展的需要下，還是在他們的經濟侵略的需要下走去的。</p>
<p>不過，因為中國地廣人衆，華僑在世界各處的也有很大的數量，再加以華人的刻苦耐勞，善節儉，所人世界各處的華僑每年所獲的資財，每年匯回本國來的欵項，其數也是不小的。我國是一個入超過，每年都有若干萬現金流出，但我國僑民每年由海外寄回的現金也有幾千萬之多，實可塡捕一部份的入超，調濟本國。所以，世界各地華僑的盛衰，不僅關係於華僑本身，而且與本國經濟也有極大的關係。</p>
<p>為了要明白華僑情形，我們且實際地來考察世界各地華僑的一切吧。</p>

<h3>Xu Shiying and Zhang Qun Take Airplane to Inspect Disaster Along the River, Passing Through Jianli, Shishou, Jingzhou, and Shashi, Everywhere Only Seeing a Vast Expanse of Water, Disaster Situation Exceeds That of the Past Twenty Years</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Shiying, on the morning of the 20th, led staff members Huang Bode, Hu Zhongshu, Zhou Yikui, etc., arriving in Hankou by Jiang'an ship. In the afternoon, he visited Zhang Xueliang, He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, etc. After a brief rest, he and Zhang Qun immediately took a plane to inspect the flood disaster in Jiangxiang, especially focusing on the disaster situation in the area of Xianghe, Fancheng, and Tianmen. It is heard that Zhang Qun requested Xu to allocate one million at a time for disaster relief, first saving the lives of the disaster victims, and then planning for rehabilitation. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Shiying, together with Zhang Qun, Chen Guangzu, Li Shucheng, etc., on the afternoon of the 20th, took a Ford plane to inspect the flood disaster along the Yangtze River, passing through Wuchang, Jiayu, Jianli, Shishou, and arriving at Jingzhou and Shashi, and then from Shashi, along the Hanyi Road, passing through Qianjiang, Tianmen, and returning to Hankou, and scheduled to take a special train to Hunan on the evening of the 21st, and return to Hankou on the 22nd to transfer to Beijing. The trip to Xiangfan has been cancelled. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Shiying returned to Hankou after inspecting the disaster upstream and talked to our reporter. He said that today he inspected along the Yangtze River and Tianqian and other places. Except for the urban area of Shashi and the county area of Qianjiang, the rest are all a vast expanse of water. The fields and houses are all submerged in huge floods. The tragedy of the disaster is indeed more severe than that of the past twenty years. He heard Director He say that many disaster victims are still waiting for rescue on the dikes and treetops. What I saw today was not much, indicating that relief should be expedited, otherwise they will still not be spared from death. The allocation of central disaster relief funds should be based on the severity of the disaster as the standard for the amount. Now, the disaster in Hubei is the most serious in the country. We should consult with the central government and provide generous subsidies to save the disaster-stricken people. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Shiying said that this year, the rivers and rivers are overflowing, and many dikes and weirs along the river have collapsed. The central government is extremely concerned. As it is my duty, I have even found it difficult to sleep and eat, so I reported to the Executive Yuan and set out to inspect, hoping to report to the central government and coordinate disaster relief. I personally inspected along the way and inquired in detail about local reports. I have telegraphed to the central government to report that the disaster situation downstream in Anhui is less severe than in Jiangxi, and it is known that Hubei Province must be even more tragic. The inspection procedure in Wuhan will be discussed with the local authorities. It is planned to first go to Yisha and Xiangfan for inspection, and then transfer to Hunan. The leaders of Wuhan are calm and responsive in flood prevention and rescue, and they are tireless day and night. They show concern for people's livelihood and feel the people's suffering. The people also have some experience, which is also the result of peacetime organization and training. Officials and people cooperate and unite to overcome difficulties, and their spirit is deeply admired. The central government's disaster relief of two million can be used in accordance with the law. I hope Hubei will prepare a budget as soon as possible and establish a custodial committee. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun told our reporter that this year's flood disaster is tragic. The main dikes such as Duobaowan and Shiyigongjiukou have all collapsed. The water is so rapid that people could not escape and many drowned. This is different from the flood ten years ago. The Xiang River basin has always been known as a prosperous area and is the essence of Hubei Province. Once it is engulfed by the flood, the loss of rice and cotton alone is hundreds of millions. Now that the water has not receded significantly, the disaster victims who have not died are still on the dikes and treetops, waiting for rescue urgently. Relief must be provided as soon as possible. I think in the future, we must not compete with the water for land and permanently eliminate floods. As for the dike repair personnel, they should be held responsible for rescue. There must also be an organization for rescue. The cause of the dike collapse this time, whether it was due to the high water that was difficult to resist, or whether it was due to poor human planning, has been requested from the central government to send personnel to investigate thoroughly. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Flood Relief Association invites the press to visit the disaster areas of Wuyang and Han. It has ordered the Maritime Public Security Bureau to prepare the Chu De cruiser, departing from Jianghan Pass at 8:00 a.m. on the 21st. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hank) Hubei will raise one million for disaster relief itself. Zhang Qun also hopes that the central government will allocate one million at a time to provide emergency relief to the disaster victims and then plan for rehabilitation measures. Zhang Xueliang and He Chengjun are also discussing disaster relief matters with Xu Shiying. Xu Shiying inspected the Zhanggong Dike on the 20th and will inspect the dikes of Wuchang again on the 21st, and go to Hunan in the evening to inspect the disaster. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Water of the Han River Continues to Recede; The Wu Hui Dike and Wu Jin Dike Collapse</h3>
<p>(Hank) The river water receded by six inches on the 20th, with the water mark at 49.7 feet, already below 50 feet. It has receded a total of 1.8 feet from the highest water level and still has a tendency to recede. The dikes along the river can escape danger. The upstream boundary receded five feet, while Yisha slightly increased. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) It is rumored that Jiang has already telegraphed to criticize Yang Silian for ineffective flood control, but whether it is true remains to be verified. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Wu Hui Dike collapsed for about six li on the evening of the 19th due to the strong northeast wind, and it is in imminent danger. Furthermore, the Wu Jin Dike continued to collapse by five zhang on the 20th. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The water level in Hankou on the 20th was 49 feet and 7 inches, which was six inches lower than on the 19th. Yichang, Changsha, and Yuezhou upstream are also gradually receding. There is no need to worry about the undiked embankments near Wuhan. (20th Telegram from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The panic of the past few weeks is now gradually receding. The water level of the Yangtze River continues to fall, and there is also news of water falling upstream, so Hankou can finally breathe freely again. This morning the water level here was 49 feet 7 inches, while yesterday morning it was 50 feet 3 inches. Although the pressure of water on Zhanggong Dike has greatly reduced, the embankment workers are still working day and night without any slack. Ye Peng is now back in charge of flood prevention duties, and the workers are greatly reassured. The area along the river is still like a battlefield with sandbags and obstacles everywhere. It will not be removed until the danger has completely passed. Xu Shiying inspected the flood situation in Jiujiang yesterday and can return to Hankou this morning. He will go to investigate the disaster areas of the Han River. It is heard that the Hankou Customs has dispatched two small boats to carry food and medicine to rescue the refugees in the upper disaster areas of Hankou. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Reuters received a letter from a foreigner in Changsha today, stating that the water level there has gradually fallen in the past few days, and the people are calm, and there is no fear of floods. The water level of Dongting Lake is still high, but it is expected to fall within days. 70% of the rice in Hunan Province comes from the Dongting Lake area. According to He Jian, only one-fifth of the rice production has been preserved, and it is feared that Hunan Province will eventually suffer from a rice shortage. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Today, Luokou fell by 1.5 centimeters, and the water level was 29 meters. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Kong Xiangrong telegraphed Han, saying that he had inspected the Linpu breach twice and discussed it in detail with Director Zhang. Now, we should take advantage of the water receding to rush to block the first, second, and third sluice gates to prevent them from being washed open again when the water rises again. Furthermore, special attention should be paid to the Jiangsu dam to prevent it from collapsing, and then all of Henan will be threatened. Minister Kong also pays close attention to this. Han immediately ordered the River Bureau to act accordingly. Today, many sections of the city wall of Jiaxiang were collapsed by the water, and more than 2,500 disaster victims have been accommodated in the city. Some disaster-stricken refugees are willing to stay on the roofs and branches of trees, rather than escape, to avoid losing their property. Tonight, Li Yizhi and the Construction Department and the River Bureau will discuss how to block the breach and prevent it from expanding, and a decision will be announced after Li visits Han tomorrow morning.

<p>(Jinan) Li Yizhi and Zhang Honglie arrived in Jinan on the evening of the 19th. Zheng Zhaoqing of the Economic Committee, Engineer Fan Bawan of the Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory, He Fo, and Pu Derui came together. Zhang Jingyu, Director of the Henan Construction Department, and Zhang Hanying, Secretary-General of the Yellow River Committee, came to Jinan on the same train from Bian. Li Yizhi said that there are now four sluice gates at the breached dike that do not carry water. However, there is currently a shortage of materials and no place to extract soil. We should start preparing materials first and wait for an opportunity to block them. After inspecting Jindi, we still plan to return to Jinan. Zhang Honglie said that regarding the disaster relief funds for the flood, he has discussed with Minister Kong and is planning a solution. Li Ti'an proposed that the Economic Committee should allocate 100,000 yuan for the Yellow River-Grand Canal joint transportation project's Aishan Siphon Gate, 200,000 yuan for dredging the estuary, and 100,000 yuan for the Xiaoqing River, totaling 600,000 yuan.

<h3>Shang Zhen Arrives in Tianjin From Beiping, Denies Having Passive Intentions</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 11:30 a.m. on the 20th, Shang Zhen arrived in Tianjin from Beiping. Personnel from the Tianjin Municipal Government and the Security Command welcomed him. After Shang got off the train, he went to the Xihu Hotel to meet guests. In the afternoon, he visited Cheng Ke for his illness and talked for about an hour. Then he went to the Tianjin G'u Security Department to work. On the afternoon of the 20th, Yu Xifan, Director of the Tangshan Public Security Bureau, came to Tianjin to visit Shang Zhen to ask for instructions on important matters. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Nan Zhen said that he came to Tianjin to inspect the Tianjin Zhan Security Command. The organization of the command remains the same and will not be changed. However, there is a separation of information between Tianjin and Bao, and official documents between the two places must be received the next day. In the future, a method of improvement will be sought. The Tianjin Municipal Government plans to occupy the command's housing. He will wait until he takes office to convene a regular meeting of the provincial government to listen to the decision of the committees. He has no preconceived notions. The 32nd Army's allowance is allocated by the L'u Municipal Government. It has been received in June, but he personally does not want to handle it this way, as it will affect the city's construction. This matter will be determined after the municipal government submits it to the central government for approval. He has not received any telegrams about the Changyuan flood, but the provincial government has ordered people to carry 5,000 yuan for disaster relief. The 50,000 yuan for Yellow River flood prevention was originally intended for the Taixing Dike's flood control expenses. He ordered the Financial Department to allocate it when he left Bao. The provincial government telegraphed the central government to allocate funds for Yellow River disaster relief, but did not receive any reply. Hebei's finances have an annual deficit of 3 million, mostly due to bearing various expenses in the war zone, so he telegraphed the central government earlier to exempt military allowances, but did not receive any telegraphic instructions. Now the provincial government is making ends meet. The Financial Department is following his orders and rushing to handle the budget that matches income and expenditure. The province has decided to implement a commissioner system because the province has 130 counties, and the provincial government is located in Baoding, which is beyond its reach, resulting in officials not being able to be observed, the people not being able to be secure, and bandits not being able to be suppressed. There must be someone in charge. The provincial chairman's supervision of its progress should be effective. Each commissioner is scheduled to govern ten counties, with a total of thirteen vacancies. However, whether the commissioner also holds the position of county magistrate has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be decided after research. As for the power to suppress bandits, whether the commissioner also has the title of Security Commander will also be discussed. The joint office of the provincial government is being stepped up and implemented. What Baoding is currently facing are (1) insufficient housing and few restaurants, which causes the lower-level staff to suffer, and many people bathe in bathhouses every day; (2) information is too isolated, and it cannot be communicated smoothly with Pingjin. The provincial government plans to set up an office in Tianjin to handle foreign affairs, and assign a director, deputy director, and secretaries to be responsible for handling foreign affairs. The candidates and organizational structure will be considered and decided before implementation. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen had moved to the Summer Palace for several days due to the continuous hot weather. Now, as the affairs of the Tianjin Zhan Security Command are to be handled, he entered the city from the garden this morning and took the Beining Road car to Tianjin. According to him, this trip to Tianjin is purely to handle the affairs of the Tianjin G'u Security Command and is scheduled to stay in Tianjin for two or three days. If the Tianjin Bao Road is directly open to traffic, he will return to Bao along that road. Otherwise, he will still come to Ping from Tianjin and transfer to the Pinghan Road to go. The rumors that he has a passive attitude are absolutely false. After the dike on the Changyuan side collapsed, a major disaster has occurred. Fortunately, the water has now receded, but the aftermath should be planned urgently, so he is handling urgent matters such as disaster relief. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lu Xian, Director of the Hebei Provincial Construction Department, is currently in Ping to visit Shang Zhen to report on the Changyuan flood situation and discuss flood prevention plans. After the matter is completed, he will return to Baoding this morning and personally inspect Changyuan and other places within days. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Telegraphed Again, Inviting Xiao Zhenying to Go South; Qin Decun Still Needs to Recuperate</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Kong Xiangxi telegraphed Xiao Zhenying yesterday, inviting him to go to Beijing to discuss everything. After receiving the telegram, Xiao was afraid that Qin Decun's illness had just recovered and that the affairs of the provincial government were waiting to be handled, so he was afraid that it would be difficult to make the trip for a while. Today, he replied to Kong by telegram, saying that he could not leave for the south temporarily. Qin Decun had previously suffered from hemoptysis and asked for leave to recuperate in Ping. After several days of medical treatment, he has recovered. When interviewed by reporters this morning, he said that his hemoptysis has gradually recovered, but his physical strength is extremely weak and he still needs a considerable period of recuperation before he can recover. He will not leave Ping temporarily. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

After completing the investigation in Ping, they will go to various stations for inspection. Then he went to the Political and Council to visit Wang Kemin to report on everything.

<h3>The War Zone Security Team is Under the Command of Two Commissioners; The Names and Numbers are Uniformly Implemented; Shang Convened a Meeting of the Chiefs of the Various Teams</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The war zone security team and the special police team will implement a unified name and number and will be generally called the Hebei Provincial Security Team. Zhang Qingyu is the chief of the First Team, Zhang Yantian is the chief of the Second Team, Liu Zuozhou is the chief of the Third Team, Zhao Lei is the chief of the Fourth Team, and Li Yunsheng is the chief of the Fifth Team. The two troops of Feng Shoupeng and Luo Zichen stationed in Tangshan will start to be combined into a large team and will be under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Team. The command of each security team will be handed over to the commissioners of Ji, Mi, Ao, and Yu to facilitate bandit suppression in the event of an incident. Shang Zhen convened the chiefs of the various security teams to Tianjin to discuss the bandit suppression matters in the war zone and the reorganization measures for each unit. Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian were already waiting in Tianjin. Liu Zuozhou, Zhao Lei, Feng Shoupeng, and Luo Zichen each rushed to Tianjin from their defense posts on the morning of the 20th. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen said that the reorganization of the security teams in the war zone, and the command authority is handed over to the two commissioners of the Ao Yu Ji Mi area. In the event of bandit police incidents, there is no need to ask the provincial government located too far away. The requisition time has delayed the military opportunity. If the commissioners have the right to command the security team, the Sun Yongqin bandit disaster on the Great Wall line will not grow and involve diplomacy. The salaries of each security team are managed by the two commissioners' offices. In case of important matters, you can still ask him for instructions. On the 20th, Yin Rugeng did not go to Tianjin from Ping. At 6 pm, he went to the Tianjin Zhan Security Command to visit Shang Zhen. Tao Shangming will arrive on the evening train. Shang Zhen is scheduled to convene a meeting of the security team leaders in the Tianjin Zhan Security Command early on the 21st.

<h3>The Problem of Public Transportation in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Dou</p>
<p>Shanghai is a major port connecting China and foreign countries. Its prosperity and reputation surpass all other cities in the country. Generally, those seeking employment believe that opportunities are more abundant and easier to obtain here, leading to a surge of people moving to the city. Even those already employed are abandoning their current positions to seek new opportunities. Most newly established institutions do not provide accommodation, forcing the majority of employed individuals to bring their families and find their own housing. It is no wonder that Shanghai's population is rapidly increasing.</p>
<p>For those residing in Shanghai, excluding the wealthy, the four basic necessities of daily life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—are all sources of great concern due to the high cost of rent. While clothing and food expenses are indeed substantial, individuals can still adjust their spending based on their financial capabilities. However, the burden of rent is inflexible and unavoidable, making it the most difficult aspect to manage. Rent prices vary depending on the popularity of the location. Middle-class families find it unbearable to live in cramped conditions and cannot afford to rent a place on their own. They often move to remote and secluded areas to reduce their expenses. However, this results in significant distances from their workplaces, making commuting inconvenient. The available modes of transportation include vehicles, but automobiles are beyond the reach of ordinary people, and rickshaws are unsuitable for long distances. The only options that meet ideal conditions are trams and buses. The slogan "fast, safe, affordable, and accessible to the public" is indeed what we endorse and acknowledge. Given the urgent need for public transportation among citizens, how can we not pay close attention to it?</p>
<p>Speaking of public transportation in Shanghai, on the surface, it cannot be said to be underdeveloped. In the International Settlement, there are ten tram lines, seven trolleybus lines, and nine bus routes. In the French Concession, there are seven tram lines, one trolleybus line, and two bus routes. In the Nanshi area, there are four tram lines and four bus routes. In the Zhabei area, there are three bus routes. Several years ago, this was sufficient for transportation needs. However, the current situation has changed somewhat. The area of Shanghai has expanded, and what was once considered remote has now become a semi-busy district due to the influx of residents. Most of the aforementioned transportation routes operate in the city center, failing to provide equal convenience to all. In particular, the routes in the French Concession are confined to one area, leaving the majority of residents in an inconvenient situation. The change of route for the 22nd bus line has brought some relief to a portion of the residents, but there are still too few vehicles and the service ends too early at night. Furthermore, there is a significant lack of transportation routes connecting the north and south between the International Settlement and the French Concession. Considering the vital importance of public transportation to people's livelihoods and for the benefit of residents in remote areas, we dare to make three requests to the municipal authorities: (1) expand routes, (2) increase the number of vehicles, and (3) extend service hours. This will not only provide convenience to residents but also enhance the prosperity of the city. It is our sincere hope that those in charge will fulfill the expectations of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Discusses the Second Phase of Work Towards China: Abandoning the Resolution of Pending Issues in Favor of Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo Dispatch from Hualian News Agency) According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently drafting a specific plan for diplomatic work towards China. Once the plan is finalized, it will be discussed with relevant ministries. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to abandon its passive approach and move from resolving pending issues to promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation. The period after the establishment of the Tanggu Truce in May 1933, following the interruption of diplomacy due to the September 18th Incident, marked the restoration of diplomatic work. The period up to the joint declaration of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei in February of this year was considered the first phase. Since then, the second phase has begun. The first phase was a period of passive adjustment in Sino-Japanese diplomacy, during which Japan's foreign policy aimed to establish its East Asian policy by vigorously eliminating the influence of other powers in East Asia. The second phase begins with the exchange of ambassadors. Although there have been issues such as the Hebei problem and disputes in the Chahar region, the resolution of these two cases has, in fact, facilitated the basic conditions for the second phase of work. The diplomatic authorities will abandon their focus on resolving pending issues and actively promote Sino-Japanese cooperation, expecting China to voluntarily cooperate with Japan in the political, economic, and cultural spheres. Henceforth, the focus of diplomatic work will be to work together with China to build a stable East Asia.</p>

<h3>Japan vs. Canada: Trade War Becomes Concrete; Retaliatory Tariffs Implemented Yesterday; Measures to Counter Egypt's Treaty Cancellation Planned</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In retaliation for Canada's boycott of Japanese goods, the Japanese government has implemented the Trade Protection Act today, imposing special heavy taxes on Canadian goods. The Canadian government is very dissatisfied with Japan's actions. Canada's losses amount to US$6 million. Therefore, the Canadian government plans to take one of two measures to deal with Japan. The first measure is to cancel the Japan-Canada trade treaty. The second measure is to impose an additional ad valorem tax of one-third on Japanese goods as retaliation. The Japanese government has received information indicating that the Canadian side will likely adopt the second measure. (20th Dispatch from Hualian)</p>
<p>Ottawa: It was learned here today that the government is currently considering levying an additional tax of 33.3% on Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's recent boycott of Canadian goods. It is also reported that the Canadian government is only willing to levy the additional tax and does not want to cancel the trade treaty between the two countries. Government officials here are very disappointed with Japan's prohibitive taxes on Canadian goods. It is estimated here that Canadian goods worth 16 million dollars will be excluded due to Japan's Trade Protection Act. (19th Dispatch from Guomin)</p>
<p>Osaka: The Egyptian government has announced the cancellation of the Japan-Egypt trade treaty. The Osaka Spinning Association, Cotton Traders Association, Export Cotton Yarn and Cloth Traders Association, and Anglo-Japanese Trade Association held a joint meeting on the afternoon of the 19th to discuss countermeasures. As a result, the following statement was issued: Japan had previously actively imported Egyptian cotton at the request of the Egyptian government. According to statistics from January to May of this year, Japan-Egypt trade imports exceeded exports by 8 million yen. However, the Egyptian government has now cancelled the trade treaty between the two countries and imposed double tariffs on Japanese goods. Japan should retaliate against Egypt's outrageous actions by boycotting Egyptian cotton. However, as detailed telegrams have not yet been received, a meeting will be reconvened on the 20th to determine the final course of action. (20th Dispatch from Jiji)</p>
<h3>Japan-Netherlands Maritime Battle Intensifies; Japanese Merchants in Dire Straits</h3>
<p>Osaka: Since the Netherlands Indies government promulgated the policy of prioritizing Dutch ships for transportation and unloading and restricting imports, Japanese shipping merchants have been in dire straits. The Nanyo Shipping Company of Japan has announced the following policy of struggling:</p>
<p>(1) In order to compete with the Java Shipping Company, the deployment of ships will not be reduced. The three companies, Ishihara Sangyo, Osaka Shosen, and Nanyo Yusen, will continue to operate a total of fourteen ships, adhering to the active policy of six voyages per month.

<h3>Japan's Trade Protection Act</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Trade Protection Act against Canada was launched today. The text of the imperial ordinance for the launch is as follows: Article 1: In foreign trade in Showa 9 (1934), if a country has a trade surplus with Japan and imposes arbitrary taxation or sets standard prices on Japanese products for import taxes, and levies taxes in addition to general import taxes, then the products produced or manufactured in that country will be subject to an additional ad valorem import tax of 50% in accordance with Article 1 of Law No. 45 of Showa 9, starting from the date of enforcement of this ordinance and within one year, in addition to the import taxes stipulated in the Customs Tariff Law and the Import Tax Law. The same applies to products that use these goods as raw materials. Article 2: Those who wish to import goods listed in the Customs Tariff Law and the Import Tax Law must attach an import application and a certificate of origin. However, this does not apply to postal shipments. The certificate of origin must state the symbol, code, name, number, and quantity of the goods and must be certified by the imperial consulate, customs office, or other official public office or chamber of commerce in the place of production or manufacture, purchase, or shipment.

<h3>Kwantung Army Issues Final Memorandum to Outer Mongolia; Ten-Day Deadline to Respond to Second Demand, Otherwise Outer Mongolian Troops Will Be Expelled from a Certain Area</h3>
<p>(Dalian) Negotiations between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" regarding the resolution of border disputes have been prolonged and unresolved. The Kwantung Army has today delivered a document to the Outer Mongolian authorities that is essentially a de facto ultimatum. Kwantung Army leaders claim that if the Outer Mongolian authorities do not accept the "Manchukuo" side's second proposal to exchange representatives of expatriates, the Outer Mongolian troops stationed in Taisugusuma (transliteration) will be expelled. The Outer Mongolian authorities have been given a ten-day deadline to respond. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan Responds to Russian Protest; Denies Everything and Says Russia is Responsible</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian government protested to the Japanese government on July 2, questioning the incident of Japanese troops crossing the Russian-Manchukuo border. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered the ambassador to Manchukuo to investigate the truth. The detailed report has been received, denying the facts. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered its response to the Soviet Russian embassy on the afternoon of the 20th, refuting the Russian protest. The main points of the content are as follows: As a result of the investigation by the Japanese government's ambassador to Manchukuo, it was found that the first, second, fourth, and fifth items stated in your letter are not true. Furthermore, the sixth and seventh items of Japanese troops crossing the border are even more untrue. As for the cause of the third item, it was due to your country's troops invading "Manchukuo" and shooting at Manchu soldiers. The responsibility lies with your country. In short, all the events stated in your letter are completely unfounded. The responsibility for the shooting of Manchu soldiers lies with your side. Therefore, your government's protest is completely without basis. Furthermore, the passage of Japanese warships through the Heilongjiang waterway has always been a common practice. It is difficult for the Japanese government to understand why you are suddenly protesting this matter. The Japanese government has always been greatly concerned about maintaining peace and order on the Russian-Manchukuo border and has always strictly ordered officials stationed in Manchukuo to prevent border crossings. If an unexpected incident occurs, it is resolved promptly on the spot. However, the Soviet Russian government has made inappropriate slander against Japanese officials stationed in Manchukuo and has deliberately exaggerated and propagated it, causing the world to have doubts. This is something that is unbearable for the friendly relations between Japan and Russia. (20th Dispatch from Jiji)</p>
<h3>US Cotton Exports Decline</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Department of Commerce reported today that the United States exported a total of 4,519,000 bales of cotton, valued at $307,033,000, in the eleven months before June 30. Last year's exports were 7,229,000 bales, valued at $401,563,000. This sharp decline in exports is largely due to this year's high cotton prices and the subsidy policy of 1.2 cents per pound. There is currently a large amount of cotton in storage available for export. The production restriction plan has had no impact on this year's sharp decline in exports. Currently, only domestic consumers pay a progressive tax of 4.2 cents per pound, which shows that the policy is unrelated to export trade. However, exchange controls are another reason for the decline in cotton exports. Cotton exports to Germany were only 319,000 bales this year, compared to 1,274,000 bales last year. This is due to Germany's import restrictions and lack of funds. However, Japan actually purchased less cotton this year than last year, but the amount received from Japan increased by $1 million compared to last year. Sweden and India purchased more US cotton this year than last year. The UK's purchase of US cotton decreased by almost one-third, France by one-half, and Italy by one-third. Also, in the recent eleven months, Japan purchased 1,468,000 bales of US cotton, the UK purchased 708,000 bales, France purchased 353,000 bales, Italy purchased 455,000 bales, and China purchased 108,000 bales.

At the same time, silver imports totaled £59,000, a decrease of £35,000 from the previous week. Of these, £446,000 came from Japan, £35,000 from Soviet Russia, and £26,000 from El Salvador. Comparing imports and exports, the net export was £175,000. The net silver import for the previous week was £69,000. (19th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) In the week ending July 12, US silver imports totaled $8,337,000, a sharp increase of $2,680,000 from the previous week.

<h3>New Greek Cabinet Established; Prime Minister and Army Chief Remain in Office; Monarchists Win Big</h3>
<p>Athens: After a long period of meetings, the reorganization of the cabinet was completed tonight. Tsaldaris remains in the position of Prime Minister, and General Kondylis has agreed to remain as Army Chief and will also serve as Deputy Prime Minister. Maximos will head the Foreign Ministry. Kondylis's remaining in office is seen as a victory for the monarchists, making the restoration of the monarchy more hopeful. (19th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Athens: The cabinet crisis was resolved last night. Prime Minister Tsaldaris presented the list of new cabinet members to President Zaimis yesterday afternoon, and the new cabinet members have been sworn in. The outcome of this political crisis can be said to be a victory for Army Chief Kondylis. The army had clearly indicated that it insisted on Kondylis remaining as Army Chief. When Prime Minister Tsaldaris consulted, he had no choice but to reorganize the cabinet and dismiss the cabinet members who opposed Kondylis. However, it is not yet clear whether the power of the monarchists in the new cabinet has increased. (20th Dispatch from Guomin)</p>
<p>Athens: President Zaimis has commissioned former Prime Minister Tsaldaris to form a cabinet. The plebiscite to resolve the dispute between the monarchy and the republic, originally scheduled for November 15, will either be held as scheduled or temporarily postponed, depending on how Tsaldaris reorganizes the cabinet. This political crisis has given rise to various rumors, such as the rumor that former Army Chief Kondylis will collude with Air Force Commander Repas and Navy Chief of Staff Economou to restore the monarchy by force. Such rumors have now been denied by well-informed sources, and Kondylis has been reappointed as Army Chief. However, the situation remains tense, and Prime Minister Tsaldaris announced yesterday afternoon that he would strictly suppress disturbances to public order. (19th Dispatch from Guomin)</p>
<p>Athens: After the Tsaldaris cabinet submitted its resignation yesterday, it was reported by the Athens News Agency that the new cabinet had been successfully reorganized. The list of important cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Tsaldaris (remains)</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and</p>
<p>Minister of the Army: Kondylis (remains)</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs: Maximos (former Foreign Minister before the April unrest this year)</p>
<p>Minister of Finance: Soglou (former Finance Minister before the April unrest this year)</p>
<p>Minister of Interior: Rallis (remains)</p>
<p>Minister of Navy: Admiral Dousmanis (remains)</p>
<p>Minister of Justice: Kloros (remains)</p>
<p>The new cabinet members were sworn in at 11:00 p.m. last night. Political observers believe that the new cabinet is more right-leaning than the previous cabinet, indicating that the monarchists have won this coup. (20th Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Athens: The struggle between the Greek restoration faction and the republican faction threatens to develop into another revolution. Although Prime Minister Tsaldaris continues to control the government, he has declared that he will remain neutral. However, according to Athens newspapers, army and navy leaders are urging Kondylis to quickly implement a dictatorship in order to immediately welcome back the exiled Greek king, George.

<h3>Abyssinia Firmly Rejects Conditions that Cede Sovereignty and Humiliate the Nation; Unwilling to Become a Protectorate or Mandate; Many Italian Soldiers Die from Heatstroke and Illness</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian King today made a statement to a special correspondent of Reuters, emphatically stating that he would reject any solution that would make Abyssinian land a protectorate or mandate of Italy or any other country, thereby undermining Abyssinia's independence and sovereignty and the freedom of its people. He believes that Abyssinia has a just cause because the Abyssinian government has consistently striven for a peaceful solution. However, if Italy launches a military attack on Abyssinia, the Abyssinians will resolutely resist. Unfortunately, other countries' prohibition of arms supplies to Abyssinia makes it even more difficult for Abyssinia to defend its territory against foreign enemies. However, the Abyssinian government and people still hope that the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact can find a way to mediate, so as not to let the world know that the pact is merely a scrap of paper that can be disregarded by any ambitious country. We are now awaiting the decision of the League of Nations, as we are confident that justice will ultimately prevail. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian Foreign Minister issued a statement, saying that the Abyssinian King's address yesterday was sufficient to indicate Abyssinia's attitude of rejecting Italian or other countries' mandates. Something extremely moving happened at the end of the Abyssinian King's speech to Parliament yesterday. When the King said, "I would rather die in battle with my people than give up freedom," the audience erupted in cheers. Suddenly, a Muslim leader approached the throne and shouted that the Muslim subjects were willing to join forces with the Christian subjects of the country to kill the enemy. It is believed here that the Muslim leader's declaration has dispelled rumors that Muslims would not participate in the war. The British Minister met with the Abyssinian Foreign Minister for two hours today to discuss the issue of taxation on the border of British Somaliland. (19th Dispatch from Guomin)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources today, Britain does not approve of Italy's complete control over Abyssinia and insists that the resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute must be based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact and other treaties. (20th Dispatch from Guomin)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers reported London news stating that the British Ambassador to Rome, Sir Drummond, had received instructions to ask the Italian government to prepare a written statement regarding the Abyssinian case to be submitted at the League of Nations Council meeting. However, according to well-informed Italian sources, the British Ambassador has not yet made this request. It is rumored that the British had inquired whether the Italian government was willing to discuss everything with the British and French governments based on the 1906 treaty. It is generally believed that this discussion will now be conducted through diplomatic channels and will not take the form of a conference, as the Italian government does not want to be trapped in any conciliatory solution that would prevent it from gaining military and advisory control over Abyssinia. At the same time, the number of Italian soldiers in Africa who have died from heatstroke has reached 70, and 2,000 workers in the Italian colonies of Eritrea, Italian Somaliland, and the Quenim region of Abyssinia have been admitted to sanatoriums. Of the 23,000 workers sent to the two Italian colonies, 2,000 are now ill, accounting for about 9% of the total. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) London does not believe that the three countries will hold a meeting to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute before the League of Nations Council meeting. It is generally believed that such a meeting can only be held in Rome by the diplomatic representatives of the countries that signed the 1906 treaty, and only if a basis for compromise is found can it be effective. The British government has been trying to find such a basis, but has not succeeded. Therefore, unless a new solution is found soon, the situation is unlikely to develop before the League of Nations Council meeting. (20th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Regular Meeting: Announcement with Tactful Wording</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat has issued a statement with tactful wording, explaining its meaning in detail. It seems to indicate that arrangements are now complete, and the Executive Council may meet on July 29th or 30th to consider the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. It is widely expected that Ethiopia will raise the issue of some countries' governments prohibiting the export of arms to Ethiopia, while preparing for war on the other hand. Ethiopia will also declare that the League of Nations cannot have any reason to discriminate against any member state in this way and demand that the issue be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. However, Italy will likely also make statements, outlining Ethiopia's crimes and putting forward some recommendations. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat announced today that the League of Nations Executive Council has now scheduled an extraordinary meeting for July 29th to discuss the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. It is understood that this meeting will be very short, as the Executive Council will likely only appoint a fifth mediator based on the resolution of May 25th and then conclude its business. If the fifth mediator fails to assist the current mediation committee in determining responsibility for the incidents on the Italo-Ethiopian border, the League of Nations Executive Council will meet again on August 25th to handle the matter, according to the resolution. Diplomats from various countries can use this time to negotiate a compromise to avoid the outbreak of war. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign newspapers widely reported that Britain had advised Italy that the League of Nations would be holding a meeting and hoped that Italy would prepare to submit a detailed memorandum on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. Officials here completely deny this claim. Well-informed sources also said that Prime Minister Mussolini did not hold talks with the British Ambassador. Italian newspapers criticized the speech delivered by the Ethiopian Emperor to the Parliament on Thursday, arguing that various treaties prove Walwal to be Italian territory, while the Ethiopian Emperor claimed it belonged to Ethiopia. The 1906 treaty clearly stipulates that the border running north from Wardere to Seberelli corresponds to the border stipulated in the 1896 treaty. Furthermore, the fourth clause of the former treaty reiterates that the coastal areas inhabited by tribal peoples belong to Italian territory, with the exception of Ogaden, which belongs entirely to Ethiopia. In short, Italy has occupied Walwal for many years, and Ethiopia's sudden attempt to retake the area by force is a clear indication of its plan for aggression. Therefore, Italy has the right to demand an apology and compensation. (National News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Announces: 75,000 Italian Troops Pass Through Suez Canal En Route to East Africa</h3>
<p>(London) In response to a question from a Member of Parliament, Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare said that, according to the Suez Canal Company's statistics, as of the 6th of this month, 75,000 Italian soldiers had passed through the canal en route to East Africa. In addition, 29,000 Italian workers had been sent to the Ethiopian border. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini today ordered that young men born in 1915, 1916, and 1917 will receive military training every Saturday starting from September 20th. This move is expected to increase Italy's potential military force by 500,000. Today, regular troops departed from Naples, including a large battalion and part of the Fifth Division's engineering corps, 1,500 drivers and mechanics, and 285 skilled workers from other industries. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Observers here estimate today that Ethiopia can mobilize 500,000 troops, but most are untrained. Agordat currently has 15,000 troops, and it probably cannot recruit enough to reach 30,000 in a few weeks. There are approximately one million rifles, but only 250,000 of them are new-style machine guns, while the rest are old-fashioned single-shot rifles with inconsistent bullet sizes, causing considerable inconvenience for the Ethiopian army. The army has only 1,000 serviceable machine guns, six mortars, and 13 slow-flying commercial aircraft. The entire army has 200 cannons. (National News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail's correspondent in the Ethiopian capital claims that after the Ethiopian Emperor delivered a passionate speech in the House of Lords yesterday regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, patriotic fervor has swept the nation. The Ethiopian people have now formed a patriotic organization called the "Ethiopian People's Patriotic United Association," and have established 173 branches across the country. The chairman is an important clergyman, and members come from all walks of life. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Italian Counselor in Japan and the Information Department of the Japan-China News Discuss the Ethiopian Question: Mutual Defamation and Protests</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) When the Italian Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Auriti, met with Foreign Minister Hirota on the 19th to discuss the Ethiopian question, he told the Foreign Minister that it was regrettable that Japanese newspapers had recently published messages defaming Italy. The Foreign Minister replied that this issue could be inquired of the Minister of Information. Therefore, the Italian Counselor, Mr. Mariani, met with the Minister of Information, Mr. Amau, on the 19th and 20th to negotiate the matter. Mr. Amau pointed out the inappropriate attitude of Italy, demanded reflection, and declared the importance of Japan's commercial rights in Ethiopia. Specifically, Mr. Amau said to the Italian Counselor on the 19th that the Italian government had issued an unofficial statement on the 6th, stating that Ethiopia, fearing the expansion of Italy's economic power in East Africa, was resisting Italian goods and welcoming Japanese goods into the country. This action by Ethiopia violates the Italo-Ethiopian treaty. The Italian government also mentioned the Sino-Japanese problem on the 13th, defaming Japan. This matter has already been published in Italian newspapers. Since the Italian government seriously examines newspapers, seeing this report shows that the Italian government admits to the defamation of Japan. Such a fact is sufficient to irritate the Japanese people and will have an impact on Japanese-Italian relations. The Italian Counselor replied to this that for events that have a negative impact on Japanese-Italian relations, the Italian government may be asked to reflect on them. However, Ethiopia's welcoming of Japanese goods certainly violates the treaty. Mr. Amau said that the Japanese side is not yet aware of the contents of the Italo-Ethiopian treaty and will negotiate after an investigation. The meeting then ended. (Japan United News dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Sugimura, Explains the Issue of a Slip of the Tongue: The Course of the Meeting with Mussolini</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of Ambassador Sugimura's slip of the tongue is highly valued by various parties because it concerns the government's foreign policy. In order to investigate the truth, the Japan United News Agency exchanged conversations directly with Ambassador Sugimura in Rome via international wireless telephone on the evening of the 19th, listening to the course of his meeting with Prime Minister Mussolini. The Japan United News Agency reporter first asked whether the content of the Ambassador's meeting with the Italian Prime Minister, which various aspects of Japan would like to know, could be explained in detail. Ambassador Sugimura immediately replied that, currently, the Ethiopian question is very tense within Italy. There are many misunderstandings about the content of my meeting with the Italian Prime Minister. The truth is as follows: On the day of the meeting with the Italian Prime Minister, an Ambassador from a certain country first met with Prime Minister Mussolini and submitted a compromise proposal regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. However, it is heard that Prime Minister Mussolini rejected the proposal, and therefore the atmosphere throughout the country became more tense and deteriorated. Under these circumstances, my purpose in meeting with the Prime Minister was to exchange opinions on various events, including the Ethiopian issue. Because Italian newspapers have published extremely inaccurate news regarding Japan's attitude toward the Ethiopian issue, I corrected it at the meeting with the Prime Minister. Italian newspapers reported that the Japanese government was assisting Ethiopia, or that General Ugaki declared that if the Italo-Ethiopian war broke out, Japan could not maintain neutrality, etc. I said to the Italian Prime Minister that Japan has not decided on such a transitional attitude before the relationship between Italy and Ethiopia is determined, but Japan has significant commercial interests in Ethiopia, so how things develop in the future will naturally be paid attention to. The meeting then ended. The future development of the Italo-Ethiopian issue cannot be predetermined. I will certainly act in accordance with the opinions of my own government.

<h3>Anti-Jewish Riots Break Out Again in Germany: National Situation Tense; Extremist Appointed as Berlin Police Chief</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Anti-Jewish riots broke out again last night. The authorities dispatched patrol teams to suppress them and arrested a number of people. Crowds marched through the streets, shouting "Down with the Jews!" Jews frantically fled. Those in cafes in the western districts were all dragged out. The police forbade crowds from stopping and watching on the streets and immediately dispersed the rioters. The Anhalter Abendpost published a fierce article criticizing all opposition, saying that the period of patience and tolerance has now ended, and the German capital will first use an iron fist to eliminate all opposition. At the same time, Hildebrandt, a leader of the extremist faction of the Nazi Party, has been appointed as Berlin Police Chief. Many feel that things are about to erupt, and zealous Nazi Party members will do as they please. In recent weeks, these individuals have openly provoked and clashed with student groups, Stahlhelm leagues, Catholic churches, Christian churches, and Jews. Reports of clashes are coming from across Germany every day. Overall, the country is currently in a state of tension. According to a recent news report, Jews in various parts of southern Germany have been arrested for displaying arrogant and disrespectful behavior towards Nazi Party members. In Karlsruhe, five people, including the Jewish factory owner Dr. Norteck and the famous businessman Mr. Penhaimer, were arrested, reportedly for forcibly entering shops and demanding that the signs saying "German Shop" be removed. Also, the secret police of Upper Silesia and Lower Silesia ordered the Stahlhelm leagues in various districts of the provinces to disband immediately last night. At the same time, the Minister of the Interior of the State of Schaumburg-Lippe forbade Stahlhelm members from wearing insignia, uniforms, displaying flags, and holding meetings or parades. Several key members of the league have been arrested and transferred to the Sonnenburg concentration camp because they were engaged in activities against the authorities. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian's Berlin correspondent described in detail the appointment of Hildebrandt, a leader of the extremist faction of the Nazi Party, as Berlin Police Chief, saying that Propaganda Minister Goebbels held a meeting in the Tiergarten district where he is currently stationed, and that Hildebrandt's appointment was announced. This move has the air of an extremist coup within the Nazi Party, as the extremists are particularly unwelcoming of capitalist cabinet members, such as Economics Minister Schacht. It is said that the former Police Chief, Löwentritt, resigned because he did not approve of the anti-Jewish demonstrations organized by the extremist faction. However, Hildebrandt's appointment must be approved by the German leader Hitler. The matter was not discussed with Prussian Prime Minister General Göring in advance, nor with other leaders, so Hitler may not approve it. Furthermore, General Leeb, one of the most important military leaders of the Nazi Party, was not consulted about the change of Police Chief. He has now flown to Bavaria to discuss the matter with Hitler. Currently, all police officers in Berlin have been suspended from leave. Public opinion generally believes that Germany will soon be facing a dangerous period. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is rumored that an anti-Stahlhelm movement has been launched throughout Germany. Police stations across the country are searching Stahlhelm offices, dissolving their local organizations, arresting their leaders, and confiscating their assets. It is also rumored that an order will be issued in Geneva to completely dissolve the league. It is expected that the leader of the Stahlhelm league, current Minister of Labor Seldte, will also be dismissed. Today, Propaganda Minister Goebbels advocated at a Nazi Party cadre meeting the suppression of the activities of reactionary elements such as Jews and Communists. The meeting also decided to appoint Count Helldorf, the former leader of the Berlin Sturmabteilung (SA) and current police president of Potsdam, as the police chief of the capital. This move is probably related to the anti-Stahlhelm movement. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the secret police here, the Ministry of Culture and the Prussian Commissioner, Hinkel, have repeatedly warned that three artistic groups in Berlin contain dangerous elements, but to no avail. Therefore, they agreed to dissolve these three groups. These three groups are: the International Artists' Association, the International Performance Arts Guidance Association, and the German Artists' Union. At the same time, the regular publication of these three organizations, called "Order," is also prohibited from being published. (National News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Papal Envoy to Germany Protests to the German Foreign Ministry; German Catholic Bishops Also Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Papal Nuncio to Germany, Orsenigo, recently delivered a note to the German Foreign Ministry, protesting Germany's religious policy towards the Catholic Church. It is said that the note listed various facts of the German government violating the Concordat, such as the regulations in the Concordat regarding youth education, Catholic groups, and freedom of church education, as well as the laws implemented by Germany to eliminate reproductive functions. Regarding these laws, German Interior Minister Frick claimed that when Germany and the Vatican signed the Concordat, they had been recognized as legal by the Vatican. In addition, the German Catholic bishops held a religious conference in Fulda Cathedral, drafting a warning to be read in Catholic churches in order to determine the Church's attitude towards the recent religious policies of the Nazi Party government. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Prussian Prime Minister Göring today ordered the secret police to infiltrate Catholic churches on Sunday to worship, in order to detect whether the priests have any different opinions regarding the recent restrictions imposed on the Church by the government. If there are different opinions, they are prepared to make major arrests. At the same time, after Helldorf, a famous hater of Jews, was appointed as Berlin Police Chief, the anti-Jewish movement of the Nazi Party youth has been revived. (National News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The proclamation issued by the German Prussian Governor Göring, advocating the continuation of the anti-Catholic movement, and the appointment of Count Helldorf, the former leader of the Berlin Sturmabteilung, as Berlin Police Chief, have received a lot of attention from Austrians. The Catholic Church believes that Göring's proclamation is tantamount to declaring open war on the Catholic Church. In addition, Viennese people have also expressed opposition to Germany's excessively harsh exclusion of Jews. It is generally believed that the Nazi Party's opposition to the Church has become extreme, and its intention is probably to divert the attention of the German people in order to cover up the truth of its financial, economic, and social distress. Therefore, Vienna is paying close attention to this new religious policy in Germany. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Demonstration by French Civil Servants Protesting Government Salary Cuts; Over 1,000 Arrested and Released</h3>
<p>(Paris) Several thousand civil servants violated the ban on street demonstrations last night, gathering near the Theater Street to protest the previous government's move to cut their salaries. The police took all precautions to avoid violence. A total of 6,000 foot and mounted police were deployed in the Theater Street area, most wearing helmets. The demonstrators sang the Internationale and shouted Communist slogans. The police then rounded up the demonstrators from all directions and repeatedly charged. Traffic on all nearby streets was stopped, and there were many onlookers. The demonstration ended at 8:10 p.m. Over 1,000 civil servants were arrested, and the rest dispersed. Although the atmosphere was tense at the time, there were no serious riots. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the 1,534 demonstrators arrested by the authorities last night, Minister of Public Works of State-Owned and Public Utilities, Mr. Paganon, Minister of Labor, Mr. Laurent-Eynac, Minister of Labor, Mr. Frossard, and Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Mr. Flandin, recently held a meeting to discuss the matter.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Kaifeng (Omissions): To all newspapers, Central China is unfortunate. Calamities have descended from the heavens. After enduring winter and spring, the prolonged rain and snow have continued. Drought demons have wreaked havoc and the two wheat harvests have been poor, plunging the livelihoods of farmers into dire straits. Unexpectedly, the rivers have suddenly risen in recent days, and the floods have overflowed, creating more disasters. For example, Yanshi City was completely submerged. The highest point is still eight or nine feet deep in water. Countless lives and properties have been lost. The old and new cities of Bobei County and districts 1567 are flooded countries. Other counties such as Lanfeng, Chenliu, Xinye, Fengqiu and Yancheng also experienced severe floods. Fields, houses, livestock, and miscellaneous items were swept away and destroyed beyond count. What crime have the people of Henan committed? It is like the catastrophe of Ross. However, the dead cannot be brought back to life, and the living should be rescued quickly. The Provincial Department of Finance reluctantly allocated 10,000 yuan to the Provincial Relief Committee for emergency relief at its discretion. However, this is a drop in the bucket and does very little good. In addition to ordering the disaster-stricken counties to rush to rescue and provide assistance, we have complied with the telegraph instruction from the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government and established the Henan Province Flood Relief General Association to actively raise funds for relief. We specially telegraphically urge you to quickly raise huge sums of money or a large amount of necessary supplies, so that they can be distributed in time for emergency relief to save the remnants. We also ask all newspapers to widely publicize this matter in order to promote relief efforts. We are extremely eager to await your orders. Liu Zhi, specially appointed Pacification Director and Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, kowtows.</p>
<h3>Western Hunan: Unprecedented Catastrophe in Shimen: Mountain Torrents Erupt, County Seat Submerged. Ruins Drown Approximately 20,000 Residents.</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Western Hunan has recently suffered repeatedly from bandit troubles. The people have already suffered unspeakable pain. Especially in recent years, there have been either floods or droughts. There is hardly a year without them. The number of people crying for food is more than hundreds of thousands. Last year, they suffered a severe drought. Local authorities were busy raising relief funds and supplying seeds. Now, as the autumn harvest is about to begin, they have suffered a serious flood. It is truly a case of misfortune never coming singly. It has been learned that among the recent floods in Western Hunan, Shimen suffered the greatest and most tragic losses. Shimen has the Xie River running through its entire territory, and its upper reaches are mostly chaotic mountains. The water flows towards it, rushing and surging, which is extremely dangerous. Between summer and autumn, the mountain waters erupt, and their momentum is even greater. According to the elders, although floods have been experienced in the past, they were only in one or several places, and remediation was easy. Even in the 20th year of the Republic, boats could travel at the foot of the county seat, but it was nothing like the current disaster. This time, from the 3rd to the 6th of this month, it rained continuously. Mountain torrents erupted as a result. All the important towns along the Xie River, from Yisha, Yongnan, Du suo city, Gu Zhouxi Moshi, along the Gongdu Zaoshi new pass, to the county seat of Yijiawan, etc., all houses and residents were swept away. No one was spared. Approximately 20,000 residents were drowned. The loss of property is simply impossible to estimate. It is now heard that local authorities are sending people to survey the damage in various places. Just considering one corner of the county seat, all the houses have been washed away. The only thing left is the octagonal building, the last few rooms of the county government, which are crooked and dilapidated. As for the original site of the Bureau of Education, it has been washed into a small creek. The rest has become a sandbar, like ruins. There is no trace of the county seat. As for the road leading north from the county seat, places such as the Ten Mile Long Beach and Ziyan Wall have become cliffs, and people can no longer pass. In other non-Xie River areas, livestock and people were swept away due to the sudden rise of streams, and houses were destroyed. Such scenes are everywhere. Moreover, where the flood reached, the plains became swamps, so that the rice crops that were about to ripen were all drowned. The fertile soil in the high-lying areas was completely scoured away, while the low-lying areas were covered with mud and sand, or even piled with gravel. The fertile land has suddenly become barren. This is truly an unprecedented and extraordinary disaster. The people of the county who are in Beijing have launched a flood relief fundraising association, on the one hand raising donations from people from outside the county and various sectors, and on the other hand requesting relief from various charitable organizations. They are also jointly launching a large-scale disaster relief campaign with fellow villagers from Jiuli who are in Beijing.</p>
<h3>The Flood-Affected Areas in the Jianghan Basin are Vast: 48 Counties in Hubei Province Report Disasters; Xiang River is the Most Severely Affected, and the Losses are Incalculable.</h3>

<h3>Jianghan Engineering Bureau Takes Over Hankou Flood Control, Various Agencies Organize Flood Inspection Teams</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: Over the past few days, the river water continues to recede, and the Wuhan dikes have turned from danger to safety. The Zhang Gong Dike protection project will still be taken over by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. The plan to build a second line of defense has also been abandoned. However, the disaster situation in various counties is severe. The important task from now on is the issue of disaster relief. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, has already set off for Hankou to inspect the disaster areas. The Provincial Government has also decided to organize a flood inspection team, divided into Jiang and Xiang groups, to set off. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun and Meng Guangpeng, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Association, jointly telegraphed various parties for disaster relief. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Dike is No Longer in Danger</p>
<p>Zhang Gong Dike in Hankou previously faced danger along its entire line during the rapid rise of the Xiang River. Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, quietly left the dike due to illness. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun authorized Ye Peng, the Garrison Commander, to supervise the rescue work, with more than 30,000 soldiers and civilians participating. The work was completely completed on the 18th. Ye believed that the dike was no longer in danger. Starting from the 18th, he handed over the dike project to the Jianghan Engineering Bureau. The garrison troops still work on the dike. After the water receded and the dike was safe, Yang went to the dike to supervise the work. The Municipal Government believed that the bureau had agreed to be responsible. On the 19th, it sent a letter requesting acceptance of the second and third sections of the project. The original letter stated: "The municipal dikes are originally divided into four sections. From Quanlu to Shaijia is the first section, from Shaijia to Gusaoshu is the second section, from Gusaoshu to Boxue Academy is the third section, and from Boxue Academy to Quanlu is the fourth section. The second and third sections are the responsibility of your bureau, and the first and fourth sections are the responsibility of our government. Since [date], the water level has broken records, and each section of Zhang Gong Dike has repeatedly warned. In order to take care of the overall situation, our government, regardless of each other, dispatched employees to transport materials and assist as much as possible. Since the 13th, Zhang Gong Dike, Jingkou, Huangjia Dawang, Gusaoshu and other places have been extremely dangerous. Ye Si〇 of the Wuhan Garrison Department and the Mayor of this city often stationed on the dike, supervising employees, soldiers and civilians to desperately rescue the danger. Fortunately, there has been no problem for several days. Now the water level has receded slightly. The second and third sections should be completely returned to your bureau to be responsible for repairs and defenses in accordance with the plan. In case of danger, our government will still adhere to its original intention and do its best to assist."</p>
<p>Provincial Government Organizes Inspection Team</p>
<p>Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, considering the severity of the disasters in various counties, should organize a flood inspection team to inspect the Jianghan River basins to determine the standards for disaster relief. The proposal was approved at the Provincial Government meeting on the 19th, and representatives from various agencies were immediately recommended to form a joint organization, led by Li Shucheng and Cheng Qibao of the Provincial Committee, to set off. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, arrived in Hankou by Jiang'an ship from Shanghai a few days ago. Xu originally planned to go directly to Shashi, without much delay in Hankou. Zhang Qun especially requested him to stay a little longer so that they could take a plane together to inspect Tianmen, Xiangfan and other areas first. Xu arrived in Hankou on the morning of the 20th and can set off on the 20th. As for the Ministry of Finance, Minister Kong promised to allocate two million yuan to relieve the Hubei disaster, half in cash, which will be allocated in installments.</p>
<p>Zhang and Meng Jointly Telegraph for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Zhang Qun and Meng Guangpeng jointly telegraphed various provinces for disaster relief on the 19th. The telegram said, "Since summer, Hubei Province has been experiencing heavy rains everywhere. The Jianghan River basins have been flooded at the same time. All counties, cities, and villages along the water have been submerged. Wuhan was spared only by rescue efforts, not to the point of collapse. In addition, the prosperous areas of agriculture and the prosperous cities of industry and commerce in the whole province have been submerged in the torrents. The loss of cotton alone is more than 100 million. Since the flood of the 20th year, disasters have been reported every year. Last year, [blank] suffered [blank], and today it has suffered flooding again. The height of this year's flood and the extent of the disaster area exceed previous records. The government's resources have been exhausted, and the people's contributions have also dried up. The surviving people are stretching their necks and waiting for food, and relief cannot be delayed. Your government has always been concerned about hunger and drowning, and has always been eager to provide assistance. We implore you to allocate relief funds or encourage donations to save this sinking disaster. We thank you for your generosity." Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, Meng Guangpeng, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Flood Relief Association, and all members, kowtow together (19th).</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the Kunshan communication column of your newspaper on the 8th, there was a report about bandits on the Su-Kun Road [blank] robbery. It stated that two workers from our factory, Wu Lizhi and Li Shouzhi, were walking back to Kunshan from Shanzheng [blank] Town, and were robbed of their clothes by bandits. After investigation, there are no such people as Wu Lizhi and Li Shouzhi among the employees of our factory, and no one has encountered bandits on the road. I think it is a misrepresentation. Please correct it. Sincerely, Kunshan County Pingmin Handicraft Factory</p>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>After reading the local news in your newspaper on July 18, there was a report that an ancient tomb was discovered during the road construction in Guyi Garden, Nanxiang. There are many inaccuracies. I have to inform you of the actual situation of this matter. When a bridge was being built at the South Gate of the Garden, a tomb without an owner was discovered. There were two coffins inside. The charity hall was requested to prepare coffins, collect the bones, and bury them in a selected location to appease the dead. When the two coffins were taken out, the heads, feet, and coffins were already rotten, so the coffins were full of water, and the bones were incomplete. They were immediately collected in accordance with the law and buried separately. There were many tiles in the two coffins. The quality was also average, and there were no inscriptions, and no characters could be found. Therefore, there was no way to test their age. Only one coffin had wooden foot toilets, like children's toys, and a round mirror of two or three inches square. The back of the mirror has four characters "Doing good is the greatest joy", and the characters can still be recognized. These three items are now preserved by the association for archaeologists to appreciate. This is the actual situation at the time. I hope you will correct the information in your column to avoid misleading the audience. I am deeply grateful. Sincerely, Guyi Park Organizing Committee, Nanxiang, July 19th.</p>

<h3>Silver and Money Industry Responds to Loan Association: Guarantees Credit Loan Amount, Banks 1 Million, Money Industry 250,000 Yuan, Loan Rules Expected to be Revised and Announced Soon</h3>
<p>Xin Xin She reported that the loan rules drafted by the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee are currently being revised and submitted to the Ministry. They are expected to be approved and implemented in the shortest possible time. The silver and money industries have submitted a list to the association of the amount of credit loans they will guarantee. The National Products Promotion League will convene an emergency meeting to discuss measures to rescue industry and commerce, and request the early implementation of the loan. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industries Confirm the Exact Amount</p>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee believes that of the 20 million yuan of this loan, 15 million yuan of mortgage loans will be lent by various banks and stores themselves, and 5 million yuan of credit loans will be lent by the Loan Association on their behalf. Therefore, according to the resolution of the previous committee meeting, letters were sent to the silver and money industry associations requesting them to submit a list of the confirmed amount. According to the spokesperson of the association yesterday morning, the reply letters from the two industries have arrived. The money industry has confirmed 250,000 yuan from the money industry reserve, and the member banks of the Banking Association (excluding China Communication) have confirmed 1 million yuan. They are still continuing to persuade them to recognize, and there is hope for an increase. As for the three banks, Zhong, Zhong, and Jiao, they previously expressed that they would recognize a total of 2.5 million yuan. They have not yet received a formal notification, but it is hoped that there will be no major problems as it is related to rescuing industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Loan Rules are Still Being Revised</p>
<p>Since the loan guarantee rules, procedures and other regulations drafted by the Loan Association were submitted to the Ministry of Finance for verification, the Ministry of Finance, in order to simplify the loan application procedures and ensure the thoroughness of the measures, has been very cautious in revising the articles. Therefore, it has been exchanging opinions with the Loan Association for days and revising them item by item, which is quite busy. The revisions have now been largely completed. A few points remain, which will be discussed at the committee meeting convened at 3:00 p.m. on the 22nd. After soliciting the opinions of the members and replying to the Ministry of Finance, it is expected to be approved and implemented in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Credit Loans Hosted by the Committee</p>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the Loan Association yesterday, since the establishment of the Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee, people from all walks of life have been coming to the association to inquire about the loan. The association also hopes that this loan can be implemented as soon as possible. In addition to the 15 million yuan of mortgage loans, which will be lent by various banks and stores themselves, the 5 million yuan of credit loans will be hosted by the committee. Various application forms have been drafted, printed and put into use long ago. As soon as the Ministry of Finance approves the regulations, loans can be released on a regular basis to meet the expectations of all sectors of society.</p>
<p>National Products Manufacturers Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>The National Products Promotion League believes that the industry and commerce loans have been delayed and have not been implemented, and manufacturers are eager to be rescued, which is already a matter of urgency. Therefore, it was resolved at the 50th Standing Committee meeting to convene all members of the four major national products groups, including the China National Products Holding Association, the National Products Factory Federation, the Machine-Made National Products Factory Federation, and the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, to hold an emergency meeting to discuss rescue measures and submit a request to the authorities to instruct various banks and stores to quickly lend money to rescue industry and commerce, so as to overcome the current difficulties.</p>
<h3>Songkou Seawall Consolidated, Gaoqiao Seawall Engineering Bureau Inspects at Any Time</h3>
<p>At a time when many places are reporting floods, the safety of the Songkou seawall in this port is of great importance to the lives of the people in Shanghai, Taicang, Jiading and other counties. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the seawall was greatly repaired last year after being blown by two decisive hurricanes the year before. The whole seawall project is very strong. In recent days, the Yangtze River has been flooded, and the water勢 outside Songkou is increasingly turbulent. Because the seawall is strong, although it has been hit by wind and waves, it has not been affected. It is also learned that Baoyu County Magistrate led a team to inspect the seawall a few days ago, and ordered them to pay attention to repairs at any time. The seawall in the Gaoqiao area is also very strong. The Municipal Works Bureau sends personnel to inspect it at any time.</p>
<p>Also reported that the sea tide in Wusongkou surged sharply the day before yesterday. It is now the peak period of spring tides, so the tide is increasing daily. It is only one or two feet away from the Wusong Outer Bund Road. The low-lying areas around Yizhou Pond are level with the shore. Fortunately, no hurricanes have been discovered, so the waves are still calm. The Baoshan seawall has been strong since it was repaired last year, and there is no danger.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Company Plans to Open Xi'an-Chengdu Route, Guangzhou Route Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Guo Wen She reported that the Eurasia Aviation Company of this port is actively preparing for the flight route between Xi'an and Chengdu, which is expected to be officially opened at the beginning of next month. At the same time, the Guangzhou route is temporarily suspended due to the small number of passengers and goods. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Plans to Open Xi'an-Chengdu Route: In addition to the original Guangzhou, Shanghai-Xinjiang, Lanzhou-Nanning, and Nanning-Baotou routes, the company has recently been actively preparing for flights between Xi'an and Chengdu, and has ordered three twin-engine Junkers aircraft from Germany for application. According to Secretary Cha of the company, there is no need to build new airports in the two places, and the mountain climate along the way is better than the western section of the Shanghai-Xinjiang route. There are no major difficulties. When there is an opportunity, a test flight will be conducted, and it is expected to be officially opened at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Route Temporarily Suspended: In addition, the company's Guangzhou route has recently been flooded by the Yangtze River, and the airports in Changsha and Hankou have been flooded, and the aircraft cannot take off and land. At the same time, the number of passengers and goods in the Zhengzhou-Guangzhou section is very small, and there are not enough aircraft to distribute. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily suspend the route. The company is now purchasing aircraft. When it arrives in Shanghai, the route will be resumed. As for the Shanghai-Xinjiang route, it can only fly to Lanzhou at present. However, the number of passengers and goods on the Xi'an-Lanzhou and Ningxia-Baotou routes has been extremely crowded recently. Since last week, the number of flights has been increased and changed to twice a week.</p>
<h3>British Mail Ship Collides with Jiankang Warship at Songkou, Both Parties' Reports Are Contradictory, British Ship Returns to Shanghai to Clarify the Truth</h3>
<p>The British Steamship Company's regular mail ship Kaisai-I-Hind, after arriving in Shanghai from London, stopped at the Gonghexiang Wharf and unloaded passengers. At 3:00 p.m. on the 16th, it loaded goods and passengers, left the wharf, and sailed out of Wusong to Kobe, Japan. At about 5:00 p.m., near the Gaoqiao River, a strong gale suddenly broke out on the Huangpu River, and a huge wave occurred at Songkou. The Jiankang destroyer of the Navy Department was also moored on the river surface near Gaoqiao. Due to the impact of the strong wind and waves, the hull of the British mail ship collided with the bow of the Jiankang ship. The head of the warship was badly damaged.</p>
<p>Telegram</p>
<p>The British mail ship Kaisai-I-Hind has a net load of 11,000 tons. The ship is huge and the steel plate is thick. The Jiankang ship is very small, with a load of 390 tons, a length of 208 feet, a width of 21 feet, a horsepower of 8,000, and a speed of 16 knots per hour. After this collision, the head was immediately destroyed and had to be repaired in the factory. The amount of loss can only be clarified after entering the dock for inspection. Due to the schedule, the British mail ship could not be delayed. After the collision, it briefly inspected the hull. The outer iron plate was not severely damaged, so it continued to sail out of Wusongkou and headed for the East. However, the shipowner sent a telegram to Shanghai on the way to report to the Shanghai company, first stating the collision, and then saying that the fault was not with the British ship. If the ship's hull is internally damaged, the warship will be responsible. It will be inspected and negotiated when it returns to Shanghai from Japan.</p>
<p>Notification Letter</p>
<p>According to the report of the Jiankang ship captain, the Navy Department said that the responsibility for the ship being hit was entirely with the British ship, because the Jiankang was anchored on the Wusong River. The degree of damage to the head of the ship is very serious. It is planned to enter the Gaochangmiao Jiangnan Shipyard on the 22nd of this month to first inspect the damage, and then start the repair. Commander Chen has sent a letter to the British Steamship Company based on this report, formally proposing negotiations. The British mail ship Kaisai-I-Hind must bear the responsibility for the collision and bear all the repair costs of the Jiankang ship.</p>
<p>Inquiry</p>
<p>The British Steamship Company has not yet expressed a definite plan for this case. Because the Kaisai-I-Hind is on its way to Japan, it is impossible to inquire about the truth. The ship has to return to Shanghai after loading passengers and cargo in Yokohama and Kobe. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai on August 5. After arriving in Shanghai, the shipowner will be summoned to inquire about the truth of the collision and determine the responsibility. Whether there are any other internal damages to the mail ship can only be known after it returns to Shanghai. At present, the reports of both parties cannot be adopted as a definitive statement.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Chamber of Commerce: Subsidiary Ledger Must Bear Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, formerly known as Hongtai Coal Brokerage, had a subsidiary ledger confiscated by a stamp duty inspector. Arguing that it had no business relationship, it submitted a sample and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for verification. Yesterday, the Chamber received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating: "Received Jiang's telegram. Upon examination of the Hongtai Coal Brokerage ledger submitted by the Chamber, the contents contain customer names, dates, and amounts. It is undoubtedly a ledger used for trade. How can it be deemed unrelated to business? Moreover, ledgers used for trade are mostly for internal use. The Provisional Regulations on Stamp Duty stipulate that stamp duty should be affixed. Therefore, regardless of whether it involves external relations, stamp duty should be affixed according to regulations. Hongtai Coal Brokerage's claim that the submitted ledger was copied from the general ledger for manager's inspection and should not be subject to stamp duty is a misunderstanding. Instruct them to inform accordingly." The original ledger is returned with this approval.</p>

<h3>Continued Report on the Tragic Disaster in Yanshi County, Henan</h3>
<p>The China Relief Association previously received reports of the extremely tragic flooding in Fancheng, Hubei, and Yanshi, Henan, which were published in previous reports. Now, it has received a telegram from the Yanshi County Temporary Disaster Relief Association and the County Relief Branch Office stating: "Yanshi's terrain is mountainous to the north and south, with the Yi and Luo Rivers running through the center, making it prone to both drought and floods. Since 1928, there have been disasters of war, bandits, drought, and locusts, with floods being the most severe. In 1931, the Yi and Luo Rivers flooded, breaching the dikes and inundating the city. Five of the county's seven districts were affected, with water depths of over ten feet inside the city, and no less than five or six feet in shallower areas. Government offices and businesses were spared from flooding. This time, the water depth reached over thirty feet, more than ten feet higher than in 1931. The entire city was submerged. The actual situation is briefly described as follows: From spring to summer this year, there was no rain for months. The wheat harvest was poor, and autumn planting was delayed. Just as people were looking forward to rain, there was a light rain on July 6, which intensified on the 7th and continued into the night. At midnight, the Yi and Luo Rivers rose sharply, and the water surrounded the city dikes. The county government led various agencies and the public to try their best to prevent breaches. By noon on the 8th, the water breached the dike in the northeast corner. After two hours of emergency repairs, three nearby breaches occurred. The southwest also reported alarms, leading to helplessness. They retreated to the city gates and ordered the people to flee. At 5:00 PM, the water collapsed the southeast two gates, and the northwest two gates were also flooded. All the houses in the city collapsed. The city was surrounded on all sides, traffic was cut off, and telephone lines were down. The county government was trapped in the Daxian Building, middle school students were trapped in the Zunjing Pavilion, elementary school was trapped in the Ercheng Pavilion, and over two thousand other people who had not escaped fled to the north city wall and the high hall behind the Minsheng Factory, as well as the pavilion behind Zhongshan Park. At nightfall, there were still many people in the treetops or on the roofs, and the sound of their cries was unbearable. The number of people drowned was no less than several hundred, and about a thousand heads of livestock. The sanitation department is verifying the numbers and hiring people to bury the bodies. Equipment, clothing, food, and merchants' goods were all submerged, and the value is incalculable. On the 9th, the county government moved out and temporarily moved to the Xiaoxiao School inside the city to work. The situation inside the city is like this, and the other districts are a vast ocean. The disaster is serious. We beg for great compassion and help with all your strength. We are extremely distressed and await your orders."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Singapore Remit Doubt: 20,000 Yuan to Relieve Yellow River Flood Victims</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received a telegram from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating that since the beginning of summer this year, there has been continuous rain, and the Yellow River and Yangtze River have both flooded, with the situation being as tragic as in 1931. Overseas Chinese are extremely concerned about this flood. Yesterday, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission received a remittance of 20,000 yuan from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce to relieve the Yellow River flood victims. Fundraising efforts for disaster relief in various parts of the country are now underway. Overseas Chinese in that area have already enthusiastically donated, even before the domestic fundraising efforts have gathered much money. This shows their enthusiasm for public welfare and concern for their motherland. It is heard that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will transfer the relief funds to the General Collection Office of Patriotic Donations of Overseas Chinese Affairs of the Central Party Headquarters for distribution and relief. The original telegram is recorded below: "To the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing, receive 20,000 yuan from the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Bank, please use it to relieve the Yellow River flood victims. The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, sincerely."</p>
<h3>Bar Association Asks Courts to Improve Time for Filing and Fee Collection; Most Important is the Public Document Concerning Immutable Deadlines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association notes that the courts in the city only operate for half a day during the summer months of July and August, and the number of staff has not increased compared to normal times. As a result, parties filing documents or paying fees often have to wait two or three hours to submit their documents or pay. Some even wait at the courthouse from early morning. If they arrive after 10:00 AM, they often cannot submit their documents on the same day. Such delays in filing documents do not matter if there is no immutable deadline. However, if there is a deadline, it will infringe on the rights of the parties. Therefore, it is proposed to discuss a solution with the courts to improve the situation. The Association will submit it to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to decide whether to request the courts to improve and extend the time for filing, or to instruct staff at the receiving and fee collection points to work in shifts after office hours to benefit litigants. Yesterday, the Association separately submitted requests to the Second and Third Branches of the Jiangsu High Court, the Shanghai District Court, and the Second Special District Court, requesting that the time for receiving documents and collecting fees be improved and extended.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Qiu Changsheng Case</h3>
<p>Since Yanliao giant Qiu Changsheng and others were accused by his uncle Hengbao of encroaching on jointly owned property in the criminal court of the Shanghai First Special District Court, and because confirming ownership was necessary for the encroachment case, Qiu Hengbao filed a lawsuit for confirmation in the same court's civil court. The facts of the case have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, another hearing was scheduled. The plaintiff Qiu Hengbao and his lawyer arrived at the court on time to report, while the defendants Qiu Changsheng and others were only represented by their lawyer. Other witnesses, such as Xi Henian, did not appear. At 10:00 AM, Judge Zhao took the bench in the Tenth Civil Court. The plaintiff first recounted the course of the case, followed by the testimony of witness Chen Jinzhou. Chen, who is over seventy years old with white hair and beard, testified that the Qiu family was originally wealthy and well-known in their hometown. He knew Changsheng's grandfather Shiqiang and grandfather伯鏞. When Changsheng's father Weiqing was born, the family had declined. He had sold about seven and a half acres of ancestral land to a Mr. Zhang, obtained capital, and came to Shanghai, where he prospered. They have not divided the family since then. The defendant's lawyer did not cross-examine. The judge ordered the hearing to be adjourned to August 15 at 9:45 AM to re-examine a witness. He also instructed that if the key witnesses in the case did not appear at the next hearing, the court would exercise its authority and order their arrest. The judge then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Li Changgen Dares to Impersonate Police Detective for Extortion</h3>
<p>Li Changgen (aka Bangyi), also known as Xiao Li and Li Qimei, a 31-year-old Guangdong native, is suspected of impersonating a detective from the general patrol room and extorting 500 yuan from Xu Shuijia. He was arrested and detained yesterday by detectives Jiang Shangpei and Gao Zhen. On the 9th of this month, the general patrol room suddenly received a letter addressed to Li Qimei. As the patrol room had no one by that name, it took no action, but paid close attention. Then, the owner of the Yongming Printing Company at 422 Hed Road, Mr. Xu Yongjia, went to the general patrol room to find Li Qimei. After questioning by the head of the patrol, Xu revealed the details, saying that Li Qimei, claiming to be a detective from the general patrol room, suddenly came to his place this month and said that his foreman Wu Hongbao was suspected of robbery at the Huasheng Printing Company in Hongkou and was being detained in the patrol room. He came to inform them that if they wanted to find a way out, they would have to pay Detective Yuan 500 yuan. Xu believed it to be true, because Wu Hongbao had not been to work for the past few days, and negotiated with him, but there were no results due to the amount of money. Unexpectedly, his worker Zhao Tangkai suddenly questioned him, saying that he had met Wu Hongbao at a tea house yesterday, and according to Wu, Xu wanted to harm Wu. Zhao, unaware of the details, came to question him. Hearing this, Xu was greatly surprised and went to Wu's house, where he met Wu and learned the details. He realized that Li Qimei was trying to extort money by deliberately fabricating a story to prevent Wu Hongbao from meeting him, so that he could profit from it. To understand the truth, he came to the patrol room to find Li. The head of the patrol confirmed that there was no such person as Li Qimei in the patrol room and that he was undoubtedly an imposter. He asked Xu about Li's whereabouts. Xu said that Li was scheduled to continue negotiations at Xu's residence at 9:30 AM on the 19th. The head of the patrol checked the information and sent detectives Jiang and Gao to Xu's residence to wait. At 9:30 AM, Li arrived and discussed the issue of bribing for release with Xu. Xu deliberately asked Li where he worked. Li replied that he worked in the general patrol room. At that time, the detectives ambushing nearby went forward and arrested Li. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court and prosecuted for impersonating a public official under Article 158 of the Criminal Law. The patrol room's lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated the above situation and requested a postponement for further investigation. After a brief interrogation of Xu Yongjia and Li Changgen by Judge Zhan Liangce, he ordered that they be detained and that the hearing be postponed for seven days.</p>

Due to the severe poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. His body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. Liu Chunshan, a 55-year-old Hunan native and a resident of the Kaitai Hotel on Sixth Road, was feeling financially depressed and had a morbid desire to end his life. Yesterday afternoon, he swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. The tea boy discovered him and rushed him to the hospital for treatment.

<h3>Business Failure, Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>A traveler came to the luxurious Majestic Hotel of Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 18th), claiming to be from Ningbo, named Zhang Bonian, 30 years old. He said he lived at 79 Taian Lane, North Shansi Road, and worked at the exchange. He was immediately shown to Room 332 on the third floor. He stayed overnight without any unusual behavior. Around 12:30 PM yesterday, the tea boy routinely inquired at the room whether tea was desired. After opening the door, he saw Zhang lying stiffly on the bed, mouth agape. He found an empty opium box, and knew immediately that he had taken poison. There was also a suicide note, stating that his business had failed and there was no way to recover, so he had resorted to this desperate measure. The tea boy reported this to the accounting department, which in turn reported it to the Old Zhabei Police Station. Officer No. 150 rushed to the scene and sent him to Renji Hospital in an ambulance. According to the doctor, the poison had been taken too long ago, and his life was in danger.</p>

Her hands were tied behind her back, her feet were also bound, her mouth was gagged with a leather belt, and her head had been injured by an iron object, which caused her death. According to nearby villagers, they saw three men and a woman speaking with a Tongzhou accent walking together at around 9:00 PM the night before. The area seemed suspicious, but no one questioned them. The next morning, the female corpse was discovered. It is generally believed to be a murder due to adultery. The local bailiff reported the incident to the Xujiahui Public Security Bureau and requested a coroner's examination from the local court.</p>
<h3>Xu Jingen Beats His Wife to Death - Xu (nee Shen) Sustains Fatal Injuries to Waist, Ribs, and Abdomen</h3>
<p>Xu Jingen, a native of Yancheng residing in a straw shed in the Zhabei Huazibang area, had an argument and physical fight with his wife, Xu (nee Shen) the day before.

<h3>Shanghai Performing Arts World Mourns Wang Huchen</h3>
<p>Wang Huchen, a famous actor who previously performed in "Journey to the West" (playing the main role of the Monkey King Sun Wukong) at the Gengxin Stage and Gong Stage in Zhabei, this city, was hired by stages in Nanchang, Jiangxi, and other places to perform, for a period of one month. After the period expired, he, along with his newly married dancer Wang Xiaomei from Shanghai, and drummers, hired a boat towed by a small steamer to travel downstream. Unexpectedly, when the steamer sailed to the river near Jilong Mountain, about ten miles from Nanchang, the engine suddenly broke down and stopped for repairs. Wang and the others (six people) were bored in the small boat, and the weather was hot, so he and drummer Du Shiting went swimming in the river. However, they were too weak to resist the waves and drowned together. The bodies have been transported back to Nanchang for coffin burial. The sad news spread to Shanghai, and people in the performing arts world are deeply saddened. They plan to hold a memorial service after Wang's coffin arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Pudong National Products Exhibition Scheduled to Open</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Health Bureau Instructs Wang Boyuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Health Bureau instructed Wang Boyuan, the head of the Hongkou Public Maternity Hospital: "Investigation reveals that on the 18th of this month, newspapers published a news item stating that Wang Yuan, the head of your hospital, announced that two cases of true cholera had been admitted. The bureau immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and found that the news item was completely inconsistent with the facts. Furthermore, according to the dean himself, the hospital has not found any cholera patients. Only yesterday did a reporter from a news agency call to inquire about the situation of hospitalized patients. Staff at the hospital informed him that two patients had come to the hospital for medical treatment. The reporter mistakenly believed that they were cholera patients, resulting in this erroneous news report. Cholera is a major public health concern. The hospital, before using scientific methods to diagnose and confirm patients, arbitrarily speculated and made reckless statements, which is extremely inappropriate. You should be strictly reprimanded. Furthermore, within the aforementioned news items published in various newspapers, there are also statements from the dean regarding cholera prevention and control methods, stating that before contracting the disease, one should get vaccinated, and after contracting it, one must also get a 'summer heat' shot. On what academic theory are these statements based? What are the effects and components of the so-called 'summer heat' shot? Please report in detail so that we can verify and handle it as necessary. Take heed of this order."</p>

<h3>No Copyright for Records - Ministry of Interior Has Approved, Broadcasting Industry and Radio Stations Restored Foreign Record Play Yesterday</h3>
<p>The case where wireless radio broadcasting stations broadcast records made by British Music Industries Co. and record companies must collect copyright fees has recently been approved by the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of Interior has approved that records are not copyrighted works clearly recognized by the Copyright Law, and should not enjoy copyright. More than 30 broadcasting stations in the city believed that the dispute could be concluded and restored all kinds of records from five companies including Pathe, Victor, Belle, Beacon, and Gaoting yesterday. The following is a detailed exploration of the information.</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior Approval: The Municipal Radio Broadcasting Industry Association received an instruction from the Ministry of Interior, Jing Zi No. 01027 yesterday, the original text of which reads: "The original petitioner, Wang Wanbai, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Private Wireless Radio Broadcasting Industry Association, submitted a document regarding British Electrical Music Industries Co. citing copyright regulations to restrict radio stations from broadcasting records. Is the product of a foreign company that has not been registered with the central government entitled to copyright? Please explain. The submission on June 27, 24th year of the Republic of China, has been received. It has been found that records are not copyrighted works clearly recognized by the Copyright Law and should not enjoy copyright. The Copyright Law and its implementation rules are enclosed for your information." Ministry of Interior, July 18, 24th year of the Republic of China. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Restoration of Broadcasting: According to lawyer Zhu Yapu, who represented the broadcasting industry in studying this case, the 20+ radio broadcasting stations in the city believe that since the Ministry of Interior has issued an instruction, British Music Industries Co. should not unreasonably charge copyright fees. Therefore, from yesterday, they have uniformly restored broadcasting Pathe, Gaoting, Belle, Beacon, Victor and other records. The record companies have not yet expressed any opinion on this issue.</p>
<h3>New Life Weekly Case Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>Du Chongyuan, the editor and publisher of New Life Weekly, was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment by the Second Branch of the High Court based on the prosecutor's indictment for publishing articles in the publication that harmed foreign relations. Du's wife, Hou Yuzhi, dissatisfied with the verdict, filed an independent appeal. The appeal has now been rejected by the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court. A copy of the ruling is recorded below. Appellant: Hou Yuzhi, female, 28 years old, from Liaoning, wife of the defendant, person authorized to receive service, Lawyer Yu Zhongluo, 17 Jiuxing Lane, Baike Road. Defendant: Du Chongyuan, male, 38 years old, from Liaoning, engaged in industry, resident of New Life Weekly, Fuxing Lane, Sima Road. The above-mentioned appellant filed an independent appeal against the defendant's case of harming foreign relations, dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment of this court on July 9, 24th year of the Republic of China. This court rules as follows: (Main text) The appeal is rejected. (Reasons) According to Article 22, Paragraph 1 of the Court Organization Law, although criminal cases appealed against the first-instance judgments of the High Court and its branches are under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, Article 367, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the Supreme Court's trial of appeals against the first-instance judgments of the High Court also applies the procedures of the third instance. Article 368 of the same law sets restrictions that cases of crimes listed in Article 61 of the Criminal Law shall not be appealed to the third instance after the second-instance judgment. Therefore, in cases appealed against the first-instance judgments of the High Court and its branches, due to the application of the third-instance procedure, the aforementioned restrictions must also be subject to the same application, regardless of whether the original court is the first instance or the second instance. In the Supreme Court, the application of the third-instance procedure is the same. In this case, the defendant committed a crime under Article 61, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. According to the above explanation, he shall not appeal to the third instance, and the restrictions on independent appeals are also the same. It should be ruled according to Article 376 of the Criminal Procedure Law as in the main text. Furthermore, the so-called original court in the same article should be ruled to reject, etc., which is an obligatory provision, not allowing the court any room for discretion. The request to transfer it to the Supreme Court for review should not be discussed. Clarified together. July 19, 24th year of the Republic of China, Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Presiding Judge Yu Hua, Judges Zhou Han, Xiao Xiebin, seal.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Climate Was Cool and Refreshing, South Pacific Hurricane Blowing Towards Taiwan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city was covered in clouds all day. There was thunder around 3:00 PM, with slight rain only in the Jin Shenfu Road and Longhua Road area in the southwest. A slight breeze was blowing, and the climate was cooler than the previous few days. The highest temperature was 96.8 degrees, and the lowest was only 77.9 degrees. The hurricane that originated in the South Pacific, according to the Xujiahui Observatory's 4:00 PM report, is currently blowing between 23 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, with a radius of 60 nautical miles. It has reached near Taiwan, and its direction is west-northwest.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Suddenly Experienced High Tide Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the high tide receded the day before yesterday, the highest tide of this month has already passed in the city's Huangpu River. However, the high tide that occurred at 1:03 PM yesterday was not lower than the one that occurred the previous morning. The sound of the tide on both sides of the Huangpu River was turbulent, almost level with the shore. In low-lying areas such as Jiangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, and the gutters on both sides of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road, accumulated water seeped onto the road surface. Underneath the Tianyun Building of Wing On Company on Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, the water level was almost level with the steps. Fortunately, it receded shortly after. According to the forecast of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, the tide started to rise at 1:03 PM, with a flow rate of 1.5 nautical miles per hour. The rapid rise was at 2:46 PM, and the high tide was at 3:18 PM. It is estimated that it exceeded the forecast by 9 feet 2 inches, reaching about 12 feet, and also exceeded the record of 11 feet 0.5 inches at the time of rapid rise yesterday morning. Because the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau was on holiday yesterday afternoon, it was impossible to inquire about the cause. However, according to people on ships in the Huangpu River, this tide was probably caused by the wind direction. Fortunately, the wind was very calm, so the ships coming and going were quite quiet.</p>
<h3>After the Theft of the Xin Qingying, Shipping Industry Asks to Apprehend Thieves, Submits a Telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Security Commander for Verification</h3>
<p>Regarding the theft and robbery of the Xin Qingying small steamer of the Qingji Transportation Bureau in this city, after the bureau reported to the Inland Steamer Industry Association, the association telegraphed Chen Guofu, the Security Commander of Jiangsu Province, requesting a strict investigation within a time limit. The telegram reads: "Zhenjiang, Security Commander of Jiangsu Province, Chen Junjian, according to a letter from member Qingji Steamer Bureau, the Xin Qingying small steamer towed five boats from Zhongkaiping at 4:00 on July 17. At 1:00 AM that night, a pirate ship came to the Zhangze Port area of Songjiang County. They fired two shots and ordered the ship to stop. They jumped onto the towing boats, dressed in blue military uniforms, with cloths wrapped around their heads, leg bindings, disguised faces, speaking in mixed accents, and holding pistols, bayonets, and iron cones. They robbed the ship, taking the crew's wages and deposited silver dollars, and searching the passengers' silver dollars, shirts, and pants. Nothing was spared until after 2:00 AM. The pirates then ordered the steamer to tow the boats west to Yunlai Temple, and immediately reported to the Water Public Security Bureau and reported to the Pinghu County Government. Therefore, we hereby write to your association requesting you to submit to the provincial security authorities, earnestly requesting you to order the Songjiang County Government and the Yunlai Temple Water Public Security Bureau of Jinshan County to strictly investigate together, and to quickly recover the stolen goods to reassure passengers and maintain the shipping industry, which is a public convenience. In this regard, we have investigated that since this year, inland small steamers have been stolen and robbed in various areas of Jiangsu. For example, on January 28, February 16, and May 2, the Xiexing, Gongmao, and Shenqin Public Bureaus' Xiemao, Pingjiang, and Taifeng small steamers were stolen and robbed in Panlong Port, Jiading County, Wusong River, resulting in huge losses. We have repeatedly reported to you asking you to order your subordinates to strictly investigate. However, the old cases have not been solved, and new cases have occurred. Furthermore, the Zhangze Port waterway of the Huangpu River is an essential route for transportation between Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Ships come and go frequently. The bandits dared to gather and rob in a major port, which shows that the local authorities and the First District Water Public Security Team are usually negligent in prevention, resulting in bandits everywhere and endangering merchants and travelers. Based on the previous report, we enclose the lost list and telegraphed you to strictly order the local government and the First District Water Public Security Team to arrest them within a time limit and bring them to justice, so that not only will merchants and travelers benefit, but also local security will rely on it. The Shanghai Inland Steamer Industry Association, Chairman Han Yimin respectfully bows with seal."</p>
<h3>Detective Caught a Thief, but the Procedures Were Deficient; The Owner Claimed Nothing Was Stolen</h3>
<p>Zhao Jinquan, a former detective of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, arrested suspected thieves Cai Xiaoyun and Geng Zhongyi on the road on June 3 of this year. Because he did not work with a patrol officer, the procedures were deficient. Patrol Captain Zhang Dasi brought Zhao and others to the Yuanyuan Road Substation. After interrogation by Inspector Nie Shaowen, it was found that Zhao's handling was inappropriate, so he was handcuffed and, along with Cai and Geng, sent to the West Gate Substation, then to the Public Security Bureau. Cai and Geng were transferred to the local court for interrogation and detention. Zhao Jinquan then sued Nie Shaowen, Zhang Dasi, etc., in the court's prosecutor's office for abusing handcuffs, causing the skin on his arms to tear and leaving scars. After verification, Nie and Zhang were summoned to court for interrogation and released on bail pending further instructions. It is now known that after this case occurred, Cai Jinjun, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, found that Nie Shaowen, Zhang Dasi, and Zhao Jinquan were all at fault and dismissed them successively, pending legal resolution by the court. However, the case is extremely complex. At the time of the incident, Zhao Jinquan insisted that he had witnessed Cai Xiaoyun and Geng Zhongyi stealing red banknotes from Gu Longting, an apprentice in the tobacco and paper shop opened by Tang Ruiwen, so he arrested them. Inspector Nie, after interrogating Tang Ruiwen, Gu Longting, etc., found that there was no theft, so he believed that Zhao Jinquan's handling was confused, which led to the handcuffing. Currently, the court has charged Cai Xiaoyun and Geng Zhongyi with theft and transferred them to the criminal court. Yesterday morning, Judge Lu Wenzhi specially opened the eleventh court to hear the case. First, Tang Ruiwen testified, 27 years old, from Nanhui. Gu Longting is an apprentice in my shop. Question: On June 3, was Gu Longting's banknotes stolen on the road? Answer: No theft occurred. Question: Since there was no theft, why did Zhao Jinquan arrest Cai and Geng and bring them to your shop for questioning? Answer: I don't know what Zhao Jinquan's intentions were. Question: Were you instigated by the patrol officers? Answer: How can I falsely accuse others if there was no theft? After obtaining the testimony, the judge ordered Cai Xiaoyun, Geng Zhongyi, and others in custody to be brought to the case. Cai testified that he was 40 years old, from Suqian, and engaged in the business of buying and selling old goods. Question: Where were you arrested? Answer: At the intersection of Xinqiao Road and Liyuan Road. Question: Why did the detective arrest you? Answer: Because Zhao Jinquan asked me for the Dragon Boat Festival bribe and I refused, so he falsely accused me. Question: You were arrested because you stole Gu Longting's banknotes, so he arrested you. Answer: We went to the tobacco and paper shop for questioning, and they did not lose anything. It was a false accusation, please investigate. Geng Zhongyi testified next, 33 years old, from Henan, also engaged in the business of old goods. The rest of the testimony was generally the same. After obtaining the testimony, the judge announced: "Nie Shaowen and Zhang Dasi were not summoned today and are not available for debate. We will order Nie and others to be summoned to court for a joint hearing at a later date." After the announcement, he ordered the two defendants to be returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3>Nephew Blackmails Uncle - Various Actions Exhaust the Ability to Intimidate; A Thorough Investigation Reveals It Was the Nephew Who Did It</h3>
<p>Chen Zhilian, a native of Shaoxing, opened the Huafeng Leather Soap Factory at No. 188 Linqing Road, Pudong, Shanghai, and also had a wholesale office at No. 33, Lane 237, Guangdong Road. Since last month, Chen has received as many as six threatening letters from bandits, intending to extort 5,000 yuan in silver. On the 20th of last month, a bomb was hung at the entrance of the wholesale office. On one occasion, Chen went to Ningbo on business, and the gang falsely used the name of Huafeng Factory to send a telegram ordering Chen to return to Shanghai urgently. At 8:30 AM on the 4th of this month, after Chen took a Ford bulletproof car from the factory to the wholesale office, the car was filled with bamboo chips in the cylinders by the bandits, preventing it from starting. All kinds of actions exhausted the ability to intimidate. After Chen reported to the General Patrol Room, detectives were repeatedly dispatched to the location agreed upon by the bandits to wait, but the bandits never came to the appointment. Recently, Chen has repeatedly received threatening phone calls. After the police force made every effort to investigate, they began to realize that Chen Mengyu, Chen Zhilian's nephew (owner of Jinlang Cosmetics Company, 101 Roosevelt Road), was highly suspected. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, Chief Detective Su Changsheng, Li Yidong, Detective Li Jincheng, and French Concession detectives went to No. 30 Pushi Village, Pushi Road, and arrested Chen Mengyu, Wu Depei (Chen Zhilian's nephew, from Shaoxing), Song Nianhong (Jinlang Company's accountant), and Mrs. Zhu Wang (Chen Mengyu's mother-in-law, a Shanghai woman). After interrogation, Chen Mengyu confessed that he was the one who did it. Because the Jinlang Company he operated could not be maintained, he had borrowed 3,000 yuan from his uncle Zhilian, but Chen Zhilian refused. The bomb was made because he had previously worked in the 22nd Army, so he knew a little about the manufacturing method. After it was made, he showed it to Wu Depei and Song Nianhong. Because he was afraid that the plaintiff would recognize his handwriting, he first wrote a draft of the threatening letter, and then instructed Zhu Wang to trace it in the same way, and then he wrote it separately according to what she had traced, so that the handwriting was completely different from his own. After verifying the confessions, the detectives arrested and detained them all and sent them to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Jiang Baolian clarified the previous situation, stating that the police station still needs to continue investigating this case, so please allow the four defendants to be temporarily detained. Chen Mengyu pleaded guilty and admitted without denying, only saying that it was caused by anger and that he did not really want to kidnap the plaintiff, that the facts were a case of playing around and making it real. Wu Peide, Song Nianhong, and Zhu Wang all denied conspiring. Qian Hongye, the head of the criminal court, verified the confessions and ordered the four defendants to be returned to custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Two More People Report Suicide by Letter - Request Fellow Benevolent Fuyuan Hall to Collect the Body</h3>
<p>The Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall at No. 6 Ningbo Road, French Concession, received a suicide letter mailed by someone signing as CLG some time ago, requesting the collection, burial, and marking of the body when it was discovered, which has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, another unpaid letter signed Pei Tianwen was received. After the hall paid the 4 cents postage and opened the letter, it was also a suicide letter, stating that he had been doing business in Shanghai for more than 20 years. Now, due to the poor market conditions, he could not maintain his finances. His family of several people relied solely on him for support. The future was bleak, and he was afraid that he would be better off dead. He decided to commit suicide by drowning. He had previously lied to his wife, saying that he was leaving Shanghai for Peiping to hide the truth. When leaving home, he was wearing a white Indian silk long gown, Indian silk pants, plain-colored gauze shoes, and gray silk socks. If his body is found, please collect and bury it. The coffin label should say "Zhuang Tianwen." Someone will come to collect it later. Guo Shaowen, the director of the hall, informed the Nanshi Rescue Bureau to instruct boatmen to watch out for and salvage the body in the river. On the same day, another similar suicide letter was received, signed "Xiaomei Choa" in Western script, stating that he was a junior high school graduate. Due to economic difficulties and a bad environment in his family, he was unable to continue his studies and left school to seek a living in society. As a student who had just left school, he was unfamiliar with everything in society and had no experience. Where could he find a job? The whole family relied on his elderly father, who was nearly sixty years old. The future family life would depend on him alone. How could he bear it? Due to the current bad environment and treacherous world, he felt that life was dull, so he had to commit suicide by drowning outside the Wusong Estuary. When he dies, he will be wearing a white serge suit, a broadcloth shirt, a black tie, and leather shoes, and he will be tied with heavy objects so that he will not easily float up. If he happens to float up, please collect the body, or publish "To E. Mr., your son is dead, please come and collect." Or if someone comes to collect it, then I will die in peace under the nine springs. The letter was also accompanied by Western script. Guo Shaowen, the director of the hall, notified both the Nanshi Rescue Bureau and the Wusong Rescue Bureau to watch out for and salvage the body.</p>
<h3>Wu Xixiang et al. sue their cousin for embezzlement; Judge advises both parties to reconcile</h3>
<p>Wu Xixiang, 43 years old; Xiqu, 40 years old; Xixun, 37 years old; and Xiliu, 34 years old, four brothers residing at No. 22, Puqing Li, Malong Road, French Concession, the sons of the late Wu Fuqing, a native of Anhui and former chief accountant of the Shanghai HSBC Bank, recently hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuangou to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. The complaint accuses their cousin, Wu Hengsun, residing at No. 4, Lane 159, Haig Road, French Concession, the son of the late Wu Youling, a compradore of the former Peiping HSBC Bank, of embezzling family property and partnership business profits amounting to 1.2 million taels of silver. They requested the court to summon and investigate the case according to the law, and also filed a civil suit to recover the embezzled funds and losses. The essence of their complaint stated that Wu Xixiang's father, Fuqing, had three brothers. The eldest, Youling, unfortunately passed away early, leaving behind a son, Youling. The third, Diaoqing, was raised and educated by Fuqing. In his prime, Fuqing served as the chief accountant of HSBC Bank and later took Diaoqing to Beijing to join Li Hongzhang's staff, handling matters related to the Beijing-Fengtian Railway. He recommended Diaoqing to serve as the general manager of the railway. At that time, the position of compradore at the Beijing HSBC Bank became vacant. Diaoqing wanted to force Fuqing to take the position, but Fuqing, being over sixty years old, did not want to take on such a demanding task. Instead, he appointed his cousin Youhang (the father of the defendant, Wu Hengsun) as an agent, agreeing to divide the annual profits into three equal shares, sharing the benefits. After their grandfather passed away, the three branches had not yet divided the family property. Uncle Diaolian and cousin Youling were greatly benefited by Fuqing's promotion. Youling gave some business profits but did not fully implement the original agreement. They never investigated the business situation of the Beijing HSBC Bank's compradore. After Fuqing passed away in 1923, the five brothers found themselves in a state of destitution. Compared to the two older branches, regardless of wealth or poverty, Diaoqing's branch had 6 million yuan in assets, inherited by his two sons, while Youling's estate was worth about 1.2 million taels of silver, enjoyed solely by the defendant, Wu Hengsun. In fact, the position of compradore at the Beijing HSBC Bank (currently held by Deng Junxiang after Wu Youling's death, but now resigned) was jointly operated by all three branches of the family. Now, the defendant alone occupies it, watching the plaintiffs live in hunger and cold. Repeated persuasion by relatives and friends to avoid fraternal strife was ignored by the defendant. Therefore, they had no choice but to file a lawsuit based on Article 335 of the criminal law regarding embezzlement, requesting investigation and punishment, and also filed a civil suit, requesting a judgment for compensation of the embezzled funds, in order to uphold justice. The court, upon receiving the complaint, opened a criminal court yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, presided over by Judge Qiu Huan-ying and Clerk Zhang Guancheng, summoning both parties for trial. The plaintiffs were represented by Wu Xixun and their lawyer, Peng Yuanxun. The defendant, Wu Hengsun, was represented by a defense lawyer. Wu Xixun provided his age, residence, occupation, and a brief statement of the facts of the case. The judge asked when the plaintiffs discovered the defendant's embezzlement. Wu Xixun replied that it was discovered around May of the year before last. At this point, the court noted that the defendant was not present and could not proceed with the trial. They adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it for 8:00 AM on the 27th, summoning the defendant to appear in court. The judge advised the lawyers of both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court. With that, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>Police officer leaves his post without permission; Opens fire on his mistress; Four shots fired, none hit; Police station files a lawsuit, sentencing scheduled</h3>
<p>Bian Changjin (43 years old), a native of Qingjiang, is currently a Chinese constable, No. 1269, at the Yulin Road Police Station. On the 18th of this month, at 5:30 AM, he secretly entered No. 701, Huasheng Road, and had a major quarrel with his mistress, Chen Azhen, who was from the same hometown. He fired four shots from his service pistol, No. 3469, intending to harm her. Chinese Constable No. 2859 and Western Constable No. 169, who were on guard duty, heard the alarm and arrived, arresting Bian and sending him to the First Special District Court for detention.</p>
<p>Investigation of the background</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Mr. Wang Yao-tang, the Municipal Council's lawyer, stated that the defendant and Chen Azhen had been living together since 1931. Chen's former husband, surnamed Guo (i.e., Guo Chen), had a child the following year, who died after five months. Last spring, she became pregnant again and worked at the Zhongxin Yarn Factory. Since her pregnancy, she had been lazy, often not going to the factory, and staying at home, eating for both of them. The two often quarreled. Both sides wanted to end the relationship. The defendant was represented by his friend Wang Ziquan, and Chen was represented by a Chinese constable. The defendant paid 80 yuan to settle the matter. In November, Chen gave birth to a daughter and, due to financial difficulties, asked the defendant to pay 3 yuan per month, otherwise she would take the child away. The defendant, believing the child was his, agreed to pay 3 yuan per month. In March of this year, after Chen became ill, she had an affair and cohabited with Chinese Constable No. 2371, who was from the same hometown. The defendant found out and stopped paying the monthly fee from the first day of last month. On the afternoon of the 17th, Chen happened to meet the defendant on the road and asked for the child's expenses of 3 yuan. The defendant only gave her 6 dimes, which Chen found too little, and they quarreled. She told him to take the child away quickly. They parted ways with resentment. The defendant's assigned post was at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Taopeng Road. That morning at 4:00 AM, Western Detective No. 169 still had him sign according to police station regulations to confirm whether he had left his post. However, after the Western detective left, he immediately left his post and rushed to the back room of No. 701, Huasheng Road, where he saw Chen talking with Chinese Constable No. 2371. Angered, he took action. Chen rushed out to stop him, and they quarreled again. Chinese Constable No. 2371 took the opportunity to escape. The defendant first struck Chen with his baton, then used his service pistol to shoot her. Chen managed to grab the pistol, and they both fell to the ground. A total of four shots were fired, two hitting the north and south walls, one hitting the ceiling, and one hitting the door. At the critical moment, Zhang Rentai and Zhang Guoquan, who lived together and worked as tailors, rushed out to report to Chinese Constable No. 2859 and a Western constable nearby, who rushed to the scene and arrested the defendant, taking the pistol from him. One bullet and four shell casings were found at the scene and submitted as evidence. The Municipal Council is prosecuting him under Article 305 of the criminal law for obstructing freedom and Article 271, paragraph 2, for attempted murder. The defendant has been a Chinese constable for 19 years, and his conduct has been good, with no previous offenses. The circumstances of the case are complex and there are mitigating factors. Therefore, we request leniency. Witness Zhang Rentai, Zhang Guoquan, and Chinese Constable No. 2859 explained what happened. Questioned, the defendant confessed that he was mentally confused at the time and wanted to shoot himself, not harm Chen, and asked for leniency. Chen Azhen, 34 years old, stated the events, saying that the defendant took out his pistol and either wanted to kill himself or her, so she struggled to grab it, and they both fell to the ground. Questioned, Chinese Detective No. 2371 stated that he had been living with Chen for about four months. When the defendant arrived, they were talking, and Chen went out. When the shots were fired, he had already left and was on his way. Judge Xiao, considering the facts clear, instructed the defendant's lawyer, Fan Qisheng, and the Municipal Council's lawyer, Wang, to argue the case. As it was past noon, he ordered Bian Changjin to be detained and scheduled the sentencing.</p>
<h3>Two fires at ice factory; Two incidents four months apart; Details under investigation</h3>
<p>Changshun Ice Factory, located at Wangjiazhai, Yanjiaqiao, east of Bridge No. 1, Lianjing, Pudong, is owned by local Huang Shusheng. It can store more than 2,000 gold pieces of ice each year, and the business is not bad. However, on the evening of March 17th of this year, it suddenly caught fire. In the pouring rain, the factory building was completely burned down, and the stored ice was completely melted. The loss of property and goods was about 4,000 gold pieces. Huang was almost unable to recover from this blow. But he was still unwilling to give up and raised more than 1,000 gold pieces to rebuild the factory, adding straw to build a new ice factory so that he could continue to collect ice for business this winter. Unexpectedly, on the day before yesterday, at about 1:00 PM, during a thunderstorm, the new factory suddenly caught fire again, and the fire was fierce. Although it was raining heavily, the flames did not diminish. The factory was surrounded by a small path only a foot wide, and the fire truck could not enter. The watchmen were helpless. By 3:00 PM, the factory building was completely destroyed, and the fire was extinguished. The cause of the fire is said to be lightning, but the factory had suffered an accident just four months ago, and now it has suffered a second unwarranted disaster, which can be described as misfortune never comes singly. The Tangqiao police station in charge of the area suspects that the factory has suffered two fires and that someone may have deliberately set the fire. They have ordered a strict investigation to determine if there is a personal vendetta.</p>

<h3>Foundry owner Xiang Yixing on Gonghexin Road suddenly kidnapped; Three bandits jumped out of the grass and took him away in a car; whereabouts unknown</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, a kidnapping case occurred at the north end of Gonghexin Road in Zhabei. The victim was Xiang Yixing, who owns a foundry on Oujia Road in the concession and on Hongnanshan Road in Zhabei. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Victim</p>
<p>Xiang Yixing is 50 years old, has a wife, and three sons. The eldest and second sons are both in their twenties and married. His eldest son recently had a grandson. The third son is 16 years old and still in school. Xiang has been running the Xiangxingchang Foundry on Oujia Road in the concession for decades. The business is very prosperous, so he has accumulated some wealth. Xiang rented the factory building on Oujia Road, so in order to make it permanent, he bought land on Hongnanshan Road in Zhabei and built his own factory building, named Nanshan Foundry. The second branch of Xiang Yuchang is on Oujia Road, and he also built a residence. Xiang is also a devout Buddhist, so he built a beautiful Buddhist hall near Tanjia Bridge at the northern end of Gonghexin Road, which made him a target for bandits.</p>
<p>Details of the Kidnapping</p>
<p>Since Xiang built this Buddhist hall, he has been going to the hall every morning to recite scriptures and worship Buddha. He used to take a private chartered car, but a month ago, through a woman named Wu, he bought a car from Lu on Kunshan Road, Wusong Road, for 1,050 yuan. Since then, Xiang has either taken a car or chartered a car to the Buddhist hall every morning. Yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, Xiang was in his newly purchased car, with license plate number 7102, driven by Zhang Azhuang, a 32-year-old from Ningbo, who was introduced to Xiang Yixing by the former owner Lu. Unexpectedly, when the car arrived at the north end of Gonghexin Road, after passing the Liuying Bridge turn, when it reached the Buddhist hall, three bandits in white short shirts and pants jumped out of the grass by the roadside. Two of them were holding pistols and blocked the road, ordering the car to stop. Zhang Azhuang stopped the car. The three bandits jumped into the car, drove Zhang to the back, and sat with Xiang Yixing. One bandit drove the car himself, and the other two bandits monitored the victim and the driver Zhang Azhuang. At this time, they turned the car around and headed west on Zhongshan Road, stopping the car near Bridge No. 4, No. 4 Zhongshan Road, Tanjia Bridge South. The bandits ordered Zhang to get out of the car and took off Zhang Azhuang's gauze shirt. Azhuang got out of the car and ran to the Tanzhiwan Police Station in the area to report. The station immediately sent Police Chief Lu Huaigong and Police Officer Jin Guobao to chase them, but the bandits were nowhere to be found. The police then returned and first called the Xinzha Sub-Bureau, which reported to the Supervisory Office of the Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, Tan Baoshou, the Chief Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, immediately drove to the Xinzha Sub-Bureau and inspected the scene for a week, but there was no trace of the bandits and he returned. The case is now being investigated by the Chief of the Xinzha Sub-Bureau, Ruan Kaiji, and the Detective Team is working hard to investigate. The kidnapped car has not been found as of the time of this writing. The chauffeur Zhang Azhuang is currently being held at the Xinzha Sub-Bureau.</p>

<h3>Special Article: Simplified Life Insurance and Social Insurance (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mingxin</p>
<p>(4) The Significance of Simplified Life Insurance</p>
<p>Simplified life insurance is a type of life insurance, differing only in its contract terms and management methods. However, whether it is life insurance or simplified life insurance, its establishment must be based on the following principles to be effective:</p>
<p>(1) To alleviate the common anxieties felt by the majority of people regarding their livelihoods.</p>
<p>(2) Risks must occur with a certain order.</p>
<p>(3) The world can utilize it. In today's complex social organization, people often feel insecure about their lives. Families often face the loss of their economic provider, leaving them destitute and unable to sustain themselves. It is essential to establish a life insurance system to share the risks faced by individuals. However, the occurrence of risks must have a certain order to be effectively addressed. Life insurance relies on the "law of large numbers" in actuarial science, using past experiences to predict the future. A certain order is found in the risk occurrence rate, allowing the use of mortality tables. Regardless of the system established, it must be suitable for the users' capabilities. Otherwise, even a good system will not be helpful. Ordinary life insurance, although needed by the world, has higher premiums, causing most policyholders to be wealthy, while middle and lower-class people lack the resources to join, making it difficult to popularize among the masses. The significance of creating simplified life insurance is to provide life insurance with small premiums to protect the middle and lower classes from the economic losses caused by the premature death of their breadwinners.</p>
<p>Simplified life insurance is a social enterprise that benefits the masses, as mentioned above. In European and American countries, it is called industrial insurance ("Industrial Insurance"). In Germany, it is called national insurance ("Volk-versicherung"), in France, it is called popular insurance ("Assurance Populaire"), and in Japan, it is called simplified life insurance. In Europe and the United States, because most simplified life insurance policyholders belong to the working class, it is called industrial insurance. In Japan, because it is a small-amount life insurance, the procedures for policyholders to apply for insurance must be simple, hence the name simplified life insurance. The Simplified Life Insurance Law recently promulgated in our country also uses the word "simplified" to be appropriate and to distinguish it from ordinary life insurance. The differences between simplified life insurance and life insurance are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Simplified insurance is a small-amount insurance. Ordinary life insurance amounts are larger, and policyholders must be middle-class or above. Most companies in our country set 1,000 yuan as the minimum amount. The purpose of simplified life insurance is to enable the general middle class and below to have the ability to use it and obtain economic security. Therefore, its insured amount is relatively low. In the United Kingdom, it is from five pounds to one hundred pounds. In the United States, it averages about 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. In Belgium, it is 250 francs, and in Japan, it is 450 yuan. Although the main purpose of simplified life insurance was originally created for workers, in the end, many middle and lower-class people from all walks of life also take out insurance. In Japan, in addition to laborers, farmers, merchants, and civil servants also account for the majority of policyholders. This is partly due to the convenience of simplified life insurance procedures compared to ordinary life insurance, and the small amount insured, which makes it easier for policyholders to obtain the various benefits of life insurance protection, which is its greatest reason.</p>
<p>(2) Simplified life insurance premiums are paid in a short period. Since simplified life insurance is established for middle and lower-class people, its payment method should be suitable for their economic situation. Ordinary life insurance premiums are paid annually, or with interest, they can also be paid every six months or three months. However, simplified life insurance must seek the convenience of policyholders, so European and American countries pay weekly, while Japan pays monthly. Because wages in European and American countries are paid weekly, while Japan calculates monthly, the payment period must be determined according to the policyholder's economic situation, without a doubt.</p>
<p>(3) Simplified life insurance does not require a physical examination. Ordinary life insurance companies, to prevent the joining of those with weakened bodies and diseases, have methods of examining the body to determine acceptance or rejection. Simplified life insurance has a different stance. Because it is to popularize it among the majority of people in the country so that they can all enjoy the protection of life insurance, a very large number of people will join. If everyone has to undergo a physical examination, then the complexity of the procedures and the delay in time will be unimaginable. Moreover, the premiums collected must be as low as possible. To seek low premiums, it is necessary to reduce the consumption of business expenses. Therefore, Japan exempts policyholders from physical examinations. The United Kingdom stipulates that those below fifteen pounds are exempt, and the United States stipulates that insurers have the right to examine those above five hundred yuan. From this perspective, exemption from physical examination is indeed one of the elements of simplified life insurance.</p>
<p>(4) The reduction period for simplified life insurance compensation. In principle and in fact, simplified insurance exempts the insured from physical examination. As a result, those with weakened bodies or diseases are bound to apply for insurance. The actual mortality rate of policyholders will inevitably increase, and the expenditure of compensation will also increase sharply. To correct this speculative trick, there are restrictions on compensation, which is the so-called reduction period. In Japan, when a policyholder dies within one year of the contract's establishment, the insured only receives the premiums that have been paid. If death occurs within one and a half years, it is half of the insured amount. Only upon death after one and a half years can the full insured amount be received.</p>
<p>(5) Simplified life insurance calculates the insured amount based on the premium. Simplified life insurance differs from ordinary life insurance in the calculation of the insured amount and premium. Ordinary life insurance calculates the premium to be paid based on the insured amount. For example, if someone purchases a lifetime insurance of 1,000 yuan at the age of 30, then the annual premium to be paid is 36 yuan and 17 cents. Simplified life insurance is different. It calculates the insured amount based on the premium paid. For example, if someone purchases lifetime insurance at the age of 30 and pays a monthly premium of 10 cents, then the insured amount is 40 yuan and 40 cents. If the monthly payment is 20 cents, then it is 80 yuan and 80 cents, and so on.</p>
<p>(6) Simplified life insurance premiums are collected by the insurer in principle. Collecting premiums by the insurer is an essential element in operating simplified life insurance. Because the payments are made weekly or monthly, with frequent occurrences, the insurer must assign collectors to collect from the insured's residence on time. This not only does not hinder the policyholder's working hours, but also reduces the policyholder's delays in payment. Although various countries have regulations that allow policyholders to pay at the counter of their bureau, they also offer a small discount at the same time. However, in reality, the number of people who personally go to the counter to pay is small. Therefore, based on past experience, simplified life insurance premiums cannot be successful without the collection by collectors. If the policyholder pays, then the result will inevitably be the invalidation of many contracts, which endangers the system itself.</p>
<p>(5) Japanese Simplified Life Insurance and European and American Industrial Life Insurance. Industrial life insurance in Europe and the United States and simplified life insurance in Japan differ in terms of the operating entity. European and American industrial life insurance is privately operated, while Japanese simplified life insurance is exclusively operated by the state. In Europe and the United States, this is based on the development of their free competition system, which has a long history. As mentioned earlier, American industrial life insurance is almost entirely controlled by the "Capital," "Prudential," and "John Hancock" companies, which is clear evidence. Therefore, American industrial life insurance is only subject to the supervision of insurance supervisors in each district, and federal supervisory laws do not have regulations on industrial life insurance. In the case of British industrial life insurance, it was initially operated by the state, which was the beginning of postal simplified life insurance. Unfortunately, it was not an exclusive business, and ordinary life insurance companies could also handle it, resulting in failure. Although those operated by private life insurance companies and mutual aid associations have made considerable progress, they are based on profit competition, and the burden on middle and lower-class policyholders is bound to be higher than that of state-run companies. Therefore, in countries where ordinary life insurance has not fully developed, it is especially necessary for simplified life insurance to be state-run. The differences between Japanese simplified life insurance and European and American industrial life insurance are briefly described below. (To be continued)</p>

They are scheduled to depart for the United States on the Grant President of the Dollar Company on the morning of the 23rd.</p>
<p>Increased Funding: The Boy Scout trip to the United States was originally announced by the Association to be twelve people.

As for the funding for going abroad, the approved amount was originally 25,000 yuan. Now, because two more people have been added, the central government has subsidized an additional 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Last Night: It is reported that the team of fourteen people departed from Beijing by overnight express train to Shanghai at 11:00 last night. They plan to rest in Shanghai for two days and are scheduled to depart on the Grant President of the Dollar Company on the 23rd. They are expected to arrive in Seattle, USA, early next month, and then disembark in Seattle and take a train directly to Washington. In addition to participating in the 25th Anniversary Celebration of the founding of the American Scout Movement from August 20th to 28th, they also have an important mission to promote Chinese culture and strengthen diplomatic relations.</p>

<h3>Discussion by Zhou Xianwen, Supervisor of Students in Japan: Reasons for Increased Number of Students in Japan; Currently Over 4,000</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) Zhou Xianwen, Supervisor of Students in Japan, stated in Nanjing that there are currently over 4,000 Chinese students in Japan, with a majority studying science. Their ages range from the teens to forty or fifty years old. Among them, those from the three eastern provinces account for the largest group, followed by those from Guangdong and Fujian. There are approximately 170 government-funded students from various provinces; the rest are all self-funded. Those who have received a study abroad certificate account for about two-thirds. In order to remedy the certificate issue for students studying in Japan, the Ministry of Education stipulated regulations in September, allowing students with a high school diploma in China to have their certificates reissued. These regulations are no longer applicable starting from the first day of this month. The Ministry of Education is currently discussing alternative methods. With the exception of Hebei, which directly remits the government funds to the government-funded students of that province, the government funds of all other provinces are remitted to the Supervisor's Office for temporary distribution. The speaker will go to Japan at the end of the month to resume his duties. Regarding the reasons for the increase in students studying in Japan: First, the fall of the yen; second, the cost savings; some also go to Japan to study because they failed the high school entrance examination; third, university graduates find it difficult to find suitable work in the country for a time, and going abroad to increase their education, and can request some tuition fees from their families. Although there are currently more than 4,000 people, judging from the current situation, there is the possibility of an increase.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Lixin Accounting School</h3>
<p>Lixin Accounting Tutoring School, located at 190 Ningbo Road in this city, was founded by accountant Dr. Pan Xulun. Since its establishment, it has been over seven years, and the number of graduates has reached 5,000. They are all distributed in various industrial and commercial enterprises and other institutions in this city and other places. Their service performance has been praised by all walks of life. The school is divided into correspondence and face-to-face instruction departments. The correspondence department is specially prepared for students from other cities and this city who cannot attend lectures. Students are enrolled all year round and can enroll at any time. The face-to-face instruction is divided into morning and evening classes. The morning class enrolls students during the summer vacation every year, and this year's class has been in session for many days. The evening class enrolls students twice a year in the spring and autumn. The spring class has now ended, and the next autumn class is tentatively scheduled to start on August 2-9. The curriculum is divided into elementary and advanced levels. The elementary level is for beginners to study, and is divided into elementary bookkeeping, advanced bookkeeping (Chinese group, English group), commercial arithmetic, abacus, and other subjects. The advanced level is only for those with a considerable level of advanced research and divided into advanced, bank accounting, cost accounting, government accounting, company accounting, auditing, accounting mathematics and other subjects. The period of study is half a year. The textbooks used are the "Lixin Accounting Series" compiled by the "Lixin Accountants' Office" and published by the Commercial Press. The lecturers are also personally undertaken by colleagues from the Lixin Accountants' Office, so the teaching materials for each subject are rich and the teachers' explanations are detailed, and they can learn practical and useful specialized techniques in a very short period of time. In recent years, the demand for accounting talents has been expanding, so the number of people going to the school to request enrollment has also increased sharply year by year. In the past, due to the school's building relationship, the number of students was limited, resulting in a large number of people who could not enroll in each class. All parties have always regarded this as a pity. It is heard that from this year onwards, additional classrooms have been opened and additional classes have been added to accommodate more students. In order to take into account the economic burden of students, the tuition fees for each subject have been reduced uniformly in order to seek greater popularity. Since the start of enrollment, the number of people who have gone to register in the past few days has been quite crowded.</p>
<h3>Xin Huan Vocational School Relocates to a New Address</h3>
<p>This year's Xin Huan Vocational School is well-run and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, due to the development of school affairs, the original Lan Weiai School building was insufficient for use. Therefore, a large building at 270 New Chongqing Road, at the northern end of Weihaiwei Road, has been found as a new school building. The environment there is quiet and the transportation is convenient. It is close to Jing'an Temple Road in the north and close to Edward Road in the south. It is located in the center of Shanghai. It is heard that the first batch of new male and female students admitted to the senior and junior high schools include Duan Jiatie, Chen Rongchang, Chang Xingkang, Feng Ansheng, Zhou Zhi, You Guofa, Qian Jiesheng, Xu Hongchang, Qian Meisheng, Zhou Guiyi, Ma Fuliang, Li Yixiang, Song Timing, Lu Guanrong, Chang Yongnian, Huang Longbao and other more than seventy people. The tenth examination period is set for August 13. Recently, the number of people who have requested prospectuses and registered has been very enthusiastic. In addition to the Parker Long Huan Elementary School and the Lan Weiai Road Xin Huan Second Elementary School, the school has also added the Xin Huan Third Elementary School on the vocational school campus for the convenience of residents near Chongqing Road to enroll students of all grades.</p>

<h3>Next Year's Berlin Olympics: A Grand Spectacle of Beacon Fire; Flames Shining Brightly Up to 100 Feet</h3>
<p>Berlin Correspondence: For next year's Berlin World Games, all the countries that have signed up are actively training their representatives who will attend in the future, and on the day of the opening ceremony, the beacon fire of the Olympics will be an even more magnificent sight. According to the preparations, the plan is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the World Olympics, the Olympic beacon fire must burn continuously during the Games until the end. At next year's Berlin Games, the burning of this beacon fire will be done with a gas that turns into liquid. It will be concealed by a steel pipe. After several experiments, it has been decided to use the propane gas of the Aero-Lysduleg Company of Hanover. This company is also willing to provide free of charge the hundreds of tubes of gas needed for the Games. After this gas burns, it produces bright yellow-red flames with only a little black smoke. This Olympic beacon fire will be erected at the entrance on the east side of the stadium, reaching a height of thirty-three yards, with a flame height of two yards and seven yards in total, and a width of two yards. On the day of the opening ceremony, one of the last runners in the marathon torch relay running from Greece will use the torch to light the Games beacon fire. The Games venue is built on a small plateau thirty-three yards above the ground, so this Olympic beacon fire can be seen from a great distance.</p>

<p>— Yu Binqi</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Binqi is good at swimming and has achieved remarkable results in his guidance. He went to Japan a month ago to visit the Meiji Jingu swimming competition and gained a lot. He also studied the latest swimming methods with Mr. Tuoping, the sports director of the Shanghai Western Youth YMCA. His recent book "Swimming Training Diagram" is a collection of rich information, but it has not yet been completed. Therefore, a part of it is disclosed first for the reference of those who love swimming (Editor's note).</p>
<p>Backstroke: Mr. Kiyokawa is a Japanese swimmer who attended the 10th World Games and won the 100-meter backstroke championship. His method is to move both hands at the same time, turn the arms outwards, and stroke forward from behind. Except for the mouth and nose, almost the entire head is immersed in the water. The body is balanced to facilitate smooth progress. The feet, the big toes and the big thumbs are opposite each other, the back of the foot is facing inward, and the lower legs are used to kick in a single leg. When kicking, the top is light and the bottom is heavy to reduce resistance and increase speed. The surface of the foot enters about one inch from the horizontal plane. When the back of the foot rises, the back of the foot is slightly straight. When kicking down, it is slightly inclined inwards.</p>

<h3>Being a Teacher During Summer Vacation (Talk)</h3>
<p>— Yan BOGuang</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you remember two common sayings? "A person who does not know how to read is like a blind person with eyes." Think about it: a blind person groping in the dark, how painful! In China, the illiterate account for 80 percent of the population. Aren't these many illiterate people feeling extreme pain like blind people?</p>
<p>Time passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, you will be on summer vacation again. Isn't it a pity to waste time during the summer vacation? During this summer vacation, I hope that the children of the whole country will temporarily try to be little teachers! Every time the sun sets, don't the farmers in the countryside gather on the white field to enjoy the cool breeze? You can use this time to make a thin black board, hang it on a big tree or wall, or it is best to make a wooden frame to teach them to read. Teach them ten characters a day, and one hundred characters can be recognized in ten days. Just find some new words from your books to teach them! This will help to eliminate illiteracy, and your merit is great. Put it into practice quickly! Don't miss the opportunity of the summer vacation!</p>
<h3>Random Talks on Children's Anecdotes (Story)</h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>Many of the children's stories compiled in common textbooks are fabricated and not worth having children recite and remember carefully. Our country has endless stories of famous people in history in their childhoods, which can be used by textbook editors or as materials for teachers to select and tell in their spare time; even shallow children will think that the stories of Zhang Er, Li Sheng, and others are obviously true and worthy of being remembered. Here, I will record a few anecdotes in succession, with some personal remarks added, which can be directly dedicated to our little compatriots.</p>
<p>Xie An Admonishes Punishment</p>
<p>Xie An of the Jin Dynasty, who served as the Grand Tutor, was sitting next to his brother one day at the age of seven or eight, wearing blue trousers, watching his father, who was a county magistrate, try a case. An old man had committed a crime, and the county magistrate punished him to drink strong wine; he was already excessively drunk, but he was still forced to drink it all. Xie An felt very unbearable in his heart, and whispered to his brother, "Brother! How can this be done?" These words happened to be heard by his father, who couldn't help but put on a peaceful face and said, "Does my child want me to let him go?" So he released the old man.</p>
<p>Mencius said, "The heart of compassion is in everyone." The innocence of children is the easiest to move people's hearts of benevolence. Even adults are not all cruel, perverse, and inherently so. Some are restrained by their responsibilities and do not allow them to be completely compassionate! When they are doing the daily things they are used to doing against their will, suddenly touched by the innocent words of children, how can they not express sympathy and correct it? This is what the common saying "reason overpowers Taishan" means!</p>
<h3>Bread (Common Sense)</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Bread is Min'er's favorite food, so he always asks his father to buy bread. "Dad, eating bread is very hygienic and convenient. Please buy me one today, because I've been wanting to eat it for days." This is how De'er asks his father.</p>
<p>"It's convenient for you to eat, but before you know it, it's gone. You need to know that a loaf of bread is made with a lot of blood and sweat, so next time you eat it, think about that."</p>
<p>"What does 'blood and sweat' mean? I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Anything that is obtained through hard work is called something obtained with blood and sweat."</p>
<p>"Then how much hard work goes into making a loaf of bread?"</p>
<p>"Simply put, bread is made from wheat. The process of making a loaf of bread is divided into six steps: First, the wheat is cut down from the field, and the wheat is threshed using a machine. Second, it is transported to a mill to be ground. The outer shell that is ground off the wheat is called bran, and inside the bran is flour. Third, the flour is placed in a large trough, and yeast and salt water are added. After many kneading sessions, the dough swells up. This is because the yeast is fermenting; otherwise, the bread will definitely not be fluffy. Fourth, once the raw dough is kneaded, add some more water and flour and knead it for a while. Then put it in a warm place, and after an hour or two, the dough will become loose and crispy. At this time, the bread maker cuts it into a certain weight and a certain shape. Fifth, use a long-handled wooden fork to send the bread into the oven to bake. When it is full, close the oven door and bake it for an hour before taking it out. Sixth, wrap it in paper and transport it to the city to sell."</p>
<p>"Dad, what is bran bread that is sold on the market made of?"</p>
<p>"When wheat is milled in a mill, the brown outer shell of the wheat is milled off. If the outer shell of the wheat is not milled off, the bread made will be brown. This is called bran bread, also called whole wheat bread. It has more nutrients than white bread and is easily digestible."</p>
<h3>Little Teacher (Poetry)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Little teacher, little teacher,</p>
<p>Though young in age, knowledge is deep!</p>
<p>"Chinese" is good, "arithmetic" is precise,</p>
<p>"Common sense" and "nature" are all capable.</p>
<p>Little teacher, little teacher,</p>
<p>Listen carefully to teachers' instructions,</p>
<p>Be respectful in school,</p>
<p>At home, you become the teacher.</p>
<p>Little teacher, little teacher,</p>
<p>Literacy campaign is all over Shanghai,</p>
<p>Eliminate illiteracy and relieve suffering,</p>
<p>Halfway relying on the beloved little teacher</p>
<h3>Things to Pay Attention to in Summer (Hygiene)</h3>
<p>— Nai Chang</p>
<p>When many children think of summer, they undoubtedly think of the fresh sun, the beautiful seaside, the cool shade of trees, and the limbs and legs that can be exposed outside of their clothes. Yes, summer may bring comfort to children; but on the contrary, summer also brings diseases to you!</p>
<p>In summer, the first thing children should pay attention to is diet. The saying "illness enters through the mouth" is correct. Children love to eat cold foods in summer; but when running around makes their whole body hot, their intestines are also a ball of heat. If they immediately gulp down cold things into their intestines at this time, the dangerous cases will cause the intestines to rupture, and the less severe cases will cause a major illness. The reason is that the intestines are like glass cups. When they are cold and encounter heat, or when they are hot and encounter cold, they will all burst.</p>
<p>In addition to diet, the next thing to consider is clothing. Clothing is particularly easy to show dirt under the summer sun, just like we can easily see the dust flying in the sunlight shining through the window. Therefore, in summer, you should pay special attention to the cleanliness of your clothing, otherwise, your partners and teachers will avoid you.</p>
<h3>Various Great Inventions of Modern Times (Scientific World)</h3>
<p>— Wen Yuyang</p>
<p>comfort, just like humans rubbing their whole bodies with a towel: isn't this evidence that animals also need to take a bath?"</p>
<p>The younger brother then suddenly understood: "So animals can bathe too."</p>
<h3>Fly Catching (Hygiene)</h3>
<p>— Xu Baozhang</p>
<p>This is an alarming calculation. According to zoologists, the reproduction rate of flies is very high. Each time, they can lay more than 160 eggs, and they become adults from maggots to pupae in about ten days. At this time, the offspring flies, mother flies, and grandmother flies all start laying eggs. Children! Just think, if a mother fly, her children, grandchildren, and all lay eggs, wouldn't the number be astonishing?</p>
<p>Some might say: If a mother fly lays eggs, after a month, if the flies produced by her children, grandchildren, and everyone are connected end to end, they can circle the earth twice. Children! Think about it, isn't the reproduction rate of flies astonishing?</p>
<p>Many germs, such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery, malaria, etc., all deadly diseases, often parasitize these aircraft and bomber squadrons that spread diseases, so we must kill them all without leaving a single one. Children! Isn't it the responsibility of us, as small citizens, to eradicate evil and strive to kill the enemy?</p>
<p>Su Dongpo said: "Things must rot first, and then insects will grow." Children! On the one hand, we should clean our houses, food, and bodies, pay attention to summer hygiene, and be careful about what we eat; on the other hand, we should work hard to catch flies and kill mosquitoes. Although summer and autumn are seasons of many diseases, children! I guarantee that you will get through it safely without getting sick.</p>
<h3>The Cat and the Mouse (Hungarian Fairy Tale)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, the cat and the mouse were two good friends. They lived together on an island. The cat ate birds from the trees, and the mouse ate roots from the ground. They lived a very happy life. One day, the mouse said: "I'm tired of living on this island. Let's go to the opposite shore. There are many things to eat there, you don't have to catch birds anymore, and I don't have to dig in the ground anymore."</p>
<p>So the cat and the mouse dug out a large tree root and started building a boat. The mouse used his sharp teeth to dig a hole large enough for the two of them. At the same time, the cat used his paws to scrape away the dirt from the tree root, making the outside of the boat smooth.</p>
<p>They made two small oars, then got on the boat and set off.</p>
<p>They forgot to put some food on the boat. The cat began to meow: "Meow! Meow!" meaning: "I'm hungry! I'm hungry!" The mouse also began to squeak: "Squeak! Squeak!" meaning: "I'm hungry! I'm hungry!"</p>
<p>The cat fell asleep, but the mouse stayed awake. He suddenly remembered that their boat was originally made of tree roots. So he gnawed and gnawed! He bit through the bottom of the boat, and water gushed up from below.</p>
<p>The cat woke up and saw the hole that the mouse had bitten, he was extremely angry, and his stomach was also very hungry.</p>
<p>When they swam to the dry shore, soaking wet, the cat wanted to grab the mouse and eat it. But the mouse crawled into a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>From then on, the cat often waited at the entrance of the hole.</p>

<h3>The Bubble Burst (Picture Story)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Youjian</p>
<p>(1) Fei'er put a rubber bubble on the mouth of the water pump and tied it tightly with a string, saying: "Whoever comes to get water will get a scare!"</p>
<p>(2) Rong'er came to fetch water with a tin bucket, but unexpectedly, after pumping a few times, a big bubble suddenly appeared at the mouth of the water pump; she was immediately shocked.</p>
<p>(3) With a "pop," the big bubble burst, and the water splashed out.</p>
<p>(4) Rong'er pumped a bucket of water, but Fei'er went back covered in water.</p>
<h3>Opium's Autobiography (Fairy Tale)</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>My name is Opium. My mother is Mrs. Poppy. She blooms very beautiful red or purple flowers in early summer, which are really lovely. After the flowers bloom, they bear fruit. When the fruit is not yet ripe, cut it open and collect a kind of white juice from inside. After this white juice dries, I am created—Opium. You can imagine that such a poisonous thing as me is produced from a beautiful flower, and everyone will find it strange.</p>
<p>Poppies were originally produced in places such as Asia Minor, Persia, India, and Egypt, but now there are many places in China that grow them, which is really sad.</p>
<p>People now hate me and curse me, saying that I am something that destroys the country and exterminates the race; in fact, I feel a bit wronged. It is true that I contain morphine, but if used properly, I can cure diseases, such as diarrhea and colic. After taking me, I can stop them.</p>
<p>Now those who smoke opium do not smoke me occasionally, but smoke me often, smoke me every day, so naturally they will be poisoned by me.</p>
<p>Those who smoke me every day are sallow and emaciated, with hunched shoulders and backs, looking like a skinny monkey; but they always want to sleep, and their movements are slow, not as lively as monkeys, they can simply be called "lazy monkeys." This is the loss to their bodies. There is also the economic loss: the money smoked into pipes in China every year amounts to tens of millions. If a country continues like this for a long time, it can really lead to national ruin. Do you think it's scary?</p>
<p>Speaking of when I first came to China, the time was very long ago, during the Song Dynasty, when I was transported by Arabs for medicinal purposes. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, people in Taiwan who had malaria mixed me with arsenic and added it to tobacco to smoke as medicine, which was very effective. Later, it spread to Xiamen, and then to various places. At first, when smoking, my portion was still small, but later it became more and more, and later, what was smoked was completely me, without any other impurities. By the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, the number of smokers increased day by day. Opium pipes were also manufactured, and opium dens were also opened. The Qing government then issued an order to prohibit it, but private trafficking and private smoking became more prosperous day by day.</p>
<p>By the Daoguang nineteenth year, China produced an anti-drug pioneer—Mr. Lin Zexu, who burned 20,283 boxes of opium in Humen, Guangdong, and made many anti-smoking pills to encourage people to quit smoking. At that time, there were quite a few smokers in Hubei and Guangdong provinces who broke up with me: it is a pity that the Qing government could not let him handle this matter from beginning to end, which made my power expand again. Thinking about it now, it is still a pity.</p>
<p>Well, in recent years, the Chinese government has been seriously quitting smoking. I hope that the Chinese people will refuse me to the end: I would rather become extinct myself than harm the Chinese people!</p>

<h3>Do Animals Need to Bathe? (Humorous Talk)</h3>
<p>— Wei Bingxin</p>
<p>In the summer, my mother tells my younger brother to wash every day, but my younger brother always wants to avoid it. One day, my mother said to my younger brother: "Many animals often need to take a bath: you are a human being, how can you not wash?"</p>
<p>My younger brother said: "I don't believe animals bathe: because I have never seen birds take a bath."</p>
<p>My mother said: "Ducks and geese are both birds, and they often swim in ponds, haven't you seen that? Chickens are also birds, although they can't swim in water, they often flap their wings and roll in the sand, which is their bath. Birds raised in cages often immerse their heads in water basins and splash water on their bodies to moisten their feathers; isn't this evidence that birds need to take a bath?"</p>
<p>My younger brother said: "Then do beasts also need to bathe?"</p>
<p>My mother said: "Yes. Cows that plow fields often immerse their whole bodies in the river in summer, which you have seen: dirty pigs also like to sleep in ponds, turning their bodies, as if they couldn't be more comfortable. Cats and dogs raised in the house also often need to bathe; cats sometimes stretch out their front paws and keep stroking their faces: dogs sometimes raise their hind paws and brush away the dirt on their fur. As for horses and donkeys, when they are tired, they often roll on the ground to relax their muscles. In the feet and mouths of flies. It carries many germs, flies in the air, and when it sees food and unclean places, it flies down and stops, putting the germs it carries on them. When we eat these foods, various seasonal diseases occur. Therefore, the flies in the air in summer are like the enemy's "aircraft and bomber squadrons," and we should work hard to prevent them.</p>
<p>Children! If you can make fly swatters yourself, you should work hard to kill the enemy when flies and mosquitoes first appear on the market. The fly-catching campaign gathered many children, whether at home or at school, we must</p>
<h3>Several Things Whose Names Do Not Match the Reality</h3>
<p>— Zhonghe</p>
<p>Dear children, now I will tell you about several things whose names do not match the reality, so as not to be deceived by their names:</p>
<p>Pencils The core of pencils is not made of lead, but of graphite.</p>
<p>Stainless steel Stainless steel items are not made of steel, but of aluminum.</p>
<p>Bakelite Bakelite utensils are not made of wood, but are condensed from phenol and formaldehyde under high heat and high pressure.</p>
<p>Chalk Chalk written on the blackboard is not made of lead powder, but of calcium carbonate powder.</p>
<p>Tinplate Tinplate is a sheet of iron coated with a layer of tin or zinc, not a real sheet of lead.</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor (27)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Every day for a long time, we went to the mountains and brought back loads of ivory, so many piles had already accumulated in our cargo hold. If it weren't for the fact that the people in that town saw us carrying back those large amounts of tusks every day, we could have gotten even more.</p>
<p>However, before long, they discovered where these ivory came from. One day, we went up the mountain and met several people with many mules, each carrying a load of dead elephant bones on its back.</p>
<p>Even so, by the time that ship entered port, I was already a rich man. So I chose a ship, but before I set off, the person who bought me as a slave gave me all kinds of rare things.</p>
<p>I naturally thanked him for all his kind deeds, and then we set sail. We arrived on time at a port on the Indian continent.</p>
<p>I have now seen the adventures of sea life, so I have decided not to entrust my wealth to a ship again for the rest of the journey home.</p>
<p>My plan was to stay in India for a few days, sell my goods, get a large sum of money, buy some strange and rare gifts to take back, and buy an animal to ride, and then return to my hometown by land.</p>
<p>I was on the road for a long time, because I had to cross a large desert where no trees or fruits grew. Although I endured many things and this situation could never make me feel happy, but I had experienced a lot and it was enough to save my life. I didn't expect to get away with it, and I was full of gratitude. Finally, I returned to Baghdad.</p>
<p>I immediately went to see the king and reported my experiences to him. He said that I had been away for a long time and determined that I must be happy to return. I told him the story of the elephants, and he thought it was very strange. He said that if he didn't know me well, he would consider the whole story to be untrue from beginning to end.</p>
<p>After I told him everything, he ordered the scribes to write down everything I said in gold letters so that people could read it in the future.</p>
<p>Then he gave me several gifts, combined with the many goods I had acquired in my life, which made me a wealthy man.</p>
<p>This is the end of my story. I never left home again and spent the rest of my life in peace with my friends. I must praise God, because he has greatly blessed me. (End)</p>

<h3>Finance News Conflicting News Causes Panic; Gold Price Rises Then Falls by Two Dollars and Two Cents</h3>
<p>—Its Trend Seems to Favor Reaction—</p>

Although there was a struggle in the middle, people could not maintain it, and the supply exceeded the demand, and it finally broke through the 50-yuan range again, falling to 48 yuan.

At this time, the overall trend hovered, but sentiment remained stable. Chinese merchants were still able to maintain their positions.

<h3>"Overnight Money" Closing Prices No Longer Inflated</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overnight money market remained unusually flush. On the supply side, there was an eagerness to sell, while on the demand side, due to business failures and difficulties in lending, there seemed to be no use for the funds, creating a situation of mutual lethargy. As a result, the practice of artificially inflating overnight money rates plummeted. The market opened down 8%, trading at 10%, then changed to 8%. By the close, the market had simply been cleared out ("故白劃"). Between these two days, the difference was like night and day. However, the interbank call rate remained consistently fixed at 20%, without the slightest change. The volume of interbank transactions in the morning was over 1.4 million yuan, with new transactions over 500,000 yuan. Afternoon transactions were over 400,000 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Mixed, Mostly Down, Few Up</h3>
<p>Prices Vary Based on Different Choices of Position Adjustment; "96 Bonds" Suddenly Exhibit Anomalous Inverted State After Wild Surge</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was extremely mixed, with prices in a state of uncertainty. The bulls were still struggling, and the bears did not dare to press too hard. The short-term battle had arrived, and the ultimate strength of each side would inevitably be revealed in the shortest possible time. The amount of chips available on the trading floor depended entirely on the tightness or looseness of credit. Based on the current environment and the crowded state of the market chips, pushing upwards was not easy. Although there were still operators for the "96 Bonds," their strength was sometimes exhausted. Yesterday, the market opened very calmly, with minimal fluctuations, mostly involving position adjustment transactions. However, the "96 Bonds" presented a special situation. Although No. 53 was still trying hard to pull up the price, the selling pressure was heavy, and the bears had even more positions, causing the near-term contracts to rise sharply by 3.5%, while the far-term contracts gradually fell due to strong selling from various accounts. Therefore, the market price was inverted, down by 0.2%. This kind of abnormal state often occurred when the "96 Bonds" were pushed up. This was not necessarily a sign of a sharp decline. At the close, the near-term contracts fell by 4.5%, while the far-term contracts fell by only 0.1%. Other contracts varied in price depending on the different choices of position adjustment. Most of the preceding contracts continued to fall slightly by 0.1-0.2%. After the "Gold Short Bonds," there was a slight rebound. In summary, the market results showed more declines than gains. The total trading volume was 12.61 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Oil Shares Plunge Sharply, Gasoline and Diesel Prices Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>According to a report from New Fu Co., the New York stock market yesterday (the 19th) fell slightly due to profit-taking by bulls. However, the market showed considerable resistance at the close. The market fell under the leadership of oil shares, because Atlantic Refining Company's profits in the first half of the year declined sharply, and it is expected that there will be more unfavorable reports in the industry, and gasoline and diesel prices will soon fall. Small exchange stocks and bond markets did not fluctuate much. The total daily turnover was 1.15 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cotton Rise in Straight Lines</h3>
<p>Yarn market gains have become increasingly strong in recent months. Because many yarn factories have stopped production or reduced working hours, the amount of production has been greatly reduced, and market sentiment has become stronger. At the same time, customer groups are actively purchasing chips in the exchange, with a tendency to sweep away all supplies. There is also news that certain large banks are releasing as much as possible for commodity secured loans. The remittance rate from Sichuan to Shanghai is flat, and it is expected that the sales of Sichuan yarn will develop greatly. The August contract has reached 170 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Surge More Fiercely in Recent Months</p>
<p>The opening price of yarn futures in the near month was stable. By the second and third trades, the price of raw cotton soared. At the same time, the actual yarn supply was tight. The number of goods delivered by various factories decreased. There were only more than 3,000 bales left in the exchange. The shorts covered heavily in the near month. The market rose sharply. Distant months contracts all rose above 170 yuan. Judging from the market situation, it is difficult to see a small decline in the short term. However, actual yarn sales were clear. As a result, the near-month contract closed 1.90 to 2 yuan higher than the previous day, while the distant-month contract rose 0.8 to 1.1 yuan. According to the investigation, Tongfu sold 450 bales, Tongji sold 400 bales, Yuda sold 150 bales, Dafeng sold 750 bales, Senkang sold 400 bales, Yuan Yi sold 150 bales, Taichang sold 900 bales, Yichang sold 650 bales, Changfeng sold 750 bales, Yongchang sold 1,250 bales, and De.</p>

<p>Actual Sales Relatively Weak</p>
<p>Actual yarn sales are relatively clear. According to statistics, all customer groups bought a total of 455 bales today. Prices rose by 1 yuan. Daily yarn transactions totaled over 100 bales. The purchase amounts for each customer group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong: 140, Shantou: 35, Fujian: 10</p>
<p>Xuzhou: 120, Inland: 90, Haizhou: 50</p>
<p>Changsha: 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm. The bulls in the July contract are trying to squeeze the shorts. The rising trend is very strong. It is evident that the bulls' strength is formidable. According to a partial survey, prices have risen so sharply, but the bulls have not yet sold off their positions. As for new cotton, the demand from the Han Chinese group is particularly strong. The market is also trending firm. However, the overseas cotton industry is in a flat and weak state.</p>
<p>Short Covering Intensifies</p>
<p>In the opening market for cotton futures, the prices for the 178 August contracts rose sharply. The bulls are pushing prices up more vigorously, and the situation is sharp and lively. All short positions are subject to low-priced limit orders. Market prices are rising in a straight line. However, when trading in the distant month contracts, the market conditions are more moderate. In the second round of trading, the bullish sentiment in the near month became more widespread, rising above the 5-yuan mark to 5.3 yuan, an increase of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The distant month contracts also rose sharply by 0.45 yuan. It is said that the bulls are still pushing up prices in the near month, with a target of 6 yuan. Another source said that a certain party delivered 3,700 dan of cotton that had passed inspection, and the bulls were prepared to pay a premium to that party, asking them not to make the delivery. As a result, the rising momentum became stronger.

<p>During the U.S. Cotton Zone Cargo Time, Rain Market Shows a Loosening Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with a fall of 1-4 points in each month. The near-month market was stable due to the purchase of October contracts by peers with limit orders.

<h3>Grains: Mixed Conditions in the Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw both rises and falls in various months. The reason was that the price of foreign wheat reported in Chicago rose by 0.48 to 0.10 yuan, and the price in Canada rose by 0.48 yuan or so. In the market, there were rumors at first that the Tianjin group had orders for foreign flour to be delivered in Tanggu at a price of only 0.2-0.3 yuan. As a result, the opening price for the current month had fallen to 0.33 yuan. Subsequently, it was confirmed that this rumor was false. On the customer side, there were transactions, so the asking price gradually stabilized. Moreover, as manufacturers delivered less and less of the distant months contracts, outside buyers also continued to enter the market, so the distant months seemed to be in good condition. Looking forward, if the disaster-stricken areas carry out disaster relief activities, the near-term contracts will not be too small. As a result, the current month fell by 0.005 yuan, August fell by 0.0025 yuan, September rose by 0.005 yuan, October rose by 0.0075 yuan, November rose by 0.005 yuan, and December fell by 0.002 yuan.</p>
<h3>Although Spot Wheat Transactions Are Smooth, Prices Remain Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of wheat futures in the morning did not move much after opening, as foreign wheat was only reported at 0.04-0.1 yuan, which had little effect. As a result, the opening price did not change much. Only the October contract had more active buying and selling due to transactions by traders hedging. Prices were initially stable and then weakened. In the afternoon, the current month was slightly flat due to customer hedging sales. The distant months were generally hovering with limited movements. As a result, the current month fell by 0.01 yuan, August and September remained unchanged, October fell by 0.01 yuan, and November rose by 0.01 yuan. The spot wheat market saw smooth deliveries, but prices remained stable. This was because inventories were still high and customers could not easily take advantage. The prices were: Daqiao, Liuhe, and Wuhe wheat at 3.36 yuan; Yaowan, Yanghe, and Suzhou wheat at 3.39 yuan; Yangzhou wheat at 3.33 yuan; Gaozi wheat at 3.32 yuan; Haizhou wheat at 3.35 yuan; and Wuyi wheat at 3.345 yuan. Xinda sold 2,500 bags, Shenda sold 2,000 bags, and Fuxin sold 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat | 18th | 19th | Change</p>
<p>September | 84.375 | 84.625 | Up 0.250</p>
<p>December | 85.250 | 85.500 | Up 0.250</p>
<p>Spot | 93.500 | 93.375 | Down 0.125</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat</p>
<p>August | 80.75 | 80.75 | Unchanged</p>
<p>The General Trend of Local Foreign Rice is Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, only ten-odd ships of local rice from all sources arrived (a total of about 2,000 piculs). Sales were sluggish and the market seemed weaker. It is estimated that the Qingdao group handled about 400 bags, while the prices of various thick japonica and thin indica rice were not very high or low. Prices were also stable. The price of Dujian rice was unchanged.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was quiet in the morning. Prices of all grades were uniformly lower by 0.05-0.1 yuan, because the price of rice in Hankou was reported to be lower, and the purchase amount from the Yangtze River group decreased. Jiujiang and Hankou only dealt slightly. Later, the Beiyang group suddenly purchased actively, and the local market also became active again. The market then stabilized again. A total of 6,500 bags of Saigon rice, 2,000 bags of Mindang rice, and 2,000 bags of Annam, Siam, Suguengdi, and other kinds of rice were sold, and were distributed to the local market, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Aokou, Tianjin, and other places. The rice market is temporarily stable. In the future, there may be a turning point and hopes only if customer demand is strong again. Otherwise, the market will have to hover. Yesterday's soybean cake market: because the peak season for sales has passed, the future sales market will not be as prosperous as before, so most people are pessimistic. Moreover, customer cakes cannot be left for a long time, so they have to be sold off at lower prices. However, their weight is heavier compared to factory cakes. The route for soybeans is dull. Only the local market will have scattered sales. There are no transactions in the factory's warehouse. In addition, prices have fallen again on the cable, and the market cannot help but be depressed. Therefore, the trend of the soybean market is to decline.</p>
<h3>Metals: First-Grade Tinplate Shortages Cause Price Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, the metal market has been affected by tight credit, widespread flooding, and the collapse of rural areas. The prices of various metal goods have mostly fallen due to the impact of supply exceeding demand. However, first-grade tinplate prices have risen due to shortages. Due to the lack of bottom goods, market sentiment has hardened, with prices rising by 0.25-1 yuan. However, buyers have not reduced their demand due to the price increase. The city sold 300-400 boxes, and those who continued to need it were still very enthusiastic. Therefore, the future trend of the market is very optimistic. The estimated prices are recorded below (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Yuan | Yuan</p>
<p>90 lb American goods | 15.80 | 188 lb American goods | 31.50</p>
<p>100 lb American goods | 17.00 | 200 lb American goods | 34.00</p>
<p>90 lb German goods | 13.50 | 180 lb German goods | 26.75</p>
<p>100 lb German goods | 15.00 | 200 lb German goods | 29.50</p>
<p>200 lb Italian goods | 30.00 | 180 lb French goods | 26.00</p>
<p>90 lb English goods | 13.20 | 200 lb French goods | 28.50</p>
<p>100 lb English goods | 14.70 | 180 lb Italian goods | 27.50</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Xuzhou Kui Zi Opens at 12 Yuan</h3>
<p>The new Xuzhou Kui Zi that arrived the day before yesterday was sampled yesterday. There were only 5 packages in total. The quality was good, and the color was also good. The opening price was 12 yuan. The cost was 13 yuan, which required a long trip of one yuan. However, the number was limited, which did not affect the overall market.</p>

<h3>Law and Women</h3>
<p>— Jenny</p>
<p>——Regarding the Scandalous Affair of Young Master Lin——</p>
<p>In a feudal, patriarchal society, a powerful young master could have three wives and four concubines, which society would celebrate and promote, and the law would protect in many ways. Although times have changed and the law has improved, those with power can still disregard the law, and the law still cannot restrain even a hair on their heads.</p>
<p>Now, from the first day of this month, the so-called new criminal law has been implemented. Among them, Article 239, which relates to women, states, "Anyone who has a spouse and commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or less..." This was established after much debate. Just as the new criminal law began to be implemented, a fresh and fragrant anecdote arrived.</p>
<p>In the past two days, various newspapers, both Chinese and foreign, have sensationally reported that Young Master Lin Jing, who went to the United States to study only last year, has fallen in love with a certain Miss [blank space] [blank space] [blank space], a saleswoman at an American store, and formally married her on the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>Now that the law of inheritance by a direct male heir has been abolished, and the new criminal law has been implemented, Young Master Lin already has twin wives, sisters, in China, and now he has married a new bride abroad. Whether Miss Brown in the United States and the two Misses Yin [blank space] Shaohua in China (the report stated that Young Master Lin first married Yin Yan, then married Shao Hua; Yin Yan and Shao Hua are sisters) will sue Young Master Lin according to law is not something we need to worry about. However, Article 239 of the new criminal law can be tested by the case of Young Master Lin.</p>
<h3>The Days When Empress Dowager Cixi Fled Beijing</h3>
<p>— Bi Yao</p>
<p>Whenever the 21st of July is mentioned, one cannot help but recall the incident in the year of Gengzi (1900) when Empress Dowager Cixi hastily disguised herself and fled from Beijing. This demon, who seized power, misled the country, and obstructed reform, had to abandon her magnificent gold [blank space] and precious [blank space] when the country was destroyed and the city fell. Dressed in the Han [blank space] clothing she so hated, she mingled among the refugees and fled for her life through the night. The partisans she had established scattered like scurrying rats; the [blank space] treasury she had managed was emptied at once. At this time, if she had even a little bit of humanity, she would have been overwhelmed with sorrow and regret. However, she was, after all, a demon, an evil spirit. Even as she escaped from death, she did not forget her old enemy: she temporarily pushed Consort Zhen, who had been confined in [blank space] Zhou for protecting Emperor Guangxu during the Reform Movement of 1898, to her death in a well. National hatred could be overlooked, but private grudges were not treated carelessly; with this jackal's mentality, she buried half of China.</p>
<p>Recalling that since she entered the palace in the second year of Xianfeng (1852), her power steadily increased after she gave birth to Emperor Tongzhi four years later. In the tenth year of Xianfeng, Beijing fell to the Anglo-French Allied Forces, and she followed the Emperor to Jehol to seek refuge. All major policies regarding the main war and peace efforts externally, and the reliance on Zeng Guofan internally to attack the Taiping Army, were decided by her. Less than a year later, Emperor Xianfeng passed away, and she eliminated many dissenting powerful officials. Together with the gentle Empress Dowager Ci'an, she listened to politics behind a screen, but in reality, all the power was completely in her hands; for the next several decades, she was virtually a dictatorial monarch. She was full of treacherous schemes, harmed virtuous and good people, loved grandeur and was stubbornly self-willed; the petty people flocked to her like ducks to water, and the political principles were completely swept away. Diplomacy had repeatedly suffered humiliation, yet she diverted the funds raised for the navy to build the Summer Palace. The defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 inflicted a significant blow, and it was appropriate to implement reforms and strengthen the country to save it from danger. However, she would rather see the country perish in her hands than let go of it to others for treatment; thus, she indulged her group of conservative lackeys to suppress the Reform Movement of 1898. The reactionary old forces, under her wing, grew stronger day by day, and foolishly stirred, eventually leading to the great chaos of the Gengzi Year. The foreigners' guns once again bombarded Beijing, and she, the culprit, did not even lose her head. It was a lesson that was too light for her!</p>
<p>Although these are events from several decades ago, they still evoke fresh pain when mentioned.</p>
<p>Originally, in the Chinese women's world, there were only two or three people like her who held the power alone for thousands of years. Her ability to gain power naturally relied on the help of many villains; therefore, the bad deeds after her ascension must have been surrounded by that group of people, and she herself should be forgiven to some extent. But if she could be considered a talent at all, why was she content to sit in that throne in a court where villains were rampant? We cannot, from the perspective of feminists, support our kind by letting go of her heinous crimes.</p>
<p>There is no female thief like Cixi in the country now, and talking about these things seems superfluous; but the number of women who support the reactionary old forces is more than the number of crucian carp crossing the river! There are ladies who praise the old ethics, wives who advocate female virtue, and nannies who advocate the new doctrine of virtuous wives and good mothers... Seeing that there is no more time to waste in delaying the critical national situation, they are still inciting it to enter the ancient well of suffocating life! Just look at various newspapers; which day does not have news of "A wife kills herself because her husband is unhappy," "A widow is raped and deliberately commits suicide to preserve her chastity," "A wife jumps off a building after her husband dies of illness," and the like? At this time, how hard should the cannibalistic old ethics be fought? However, imperialists [blank space] and their collaborators have no way to deal with it, and even the powerless old ethics are still supporting it, how unlucky and ignorant!</p>
<p>The twenty-first of July once gave Cixi, who supported the old forces, a head-on blow, but I wonder how much this cruel commemoration can awaken the illusions of people today?</p>
<p>Women's Issues Lecture</p>
<h3>Section Four: The "Sacred" Monogamy</h3>
<p>In capitalist society, all those in a dominant position regard monogamy as the only sacred form of marriage, and they establish and sanctify it with legal and moral norms. But we must understand that this system is essentially something that arises and develops from the private ownership of property and the social relationship of men enslaving women. That is, "Monogamy only arose when a large amount of wealth was concentrated in the hands of a few people—especially men—and they wanted to pass the wealth on to their male descendants as an inheritance, unwilling to give it to anyone else" (The Origin of the Family).</p>
<p>The historical origin of so-called monogamy is very long. In ancient Greek society, it already had its nascent form, that is, the definite [blank space] direction of the transition from polygamy to monogamy. At that time, a man selected one of his many wives to be the main wife in charge of household management, while making the rest of the wives subordinate to the main wife. In this way, he could handle household affairs in an organized manner, and on the other hand, he could overcome the animosity between the many wives that polygamy inevitably caused. Our housewives and concubines are the best example. By the feudal era and the era of commercial capitalism, the wealth concentrated in the hands of individuals was increasing day by day. The owners of these fortunes needed to strengthen monogamy even more in order to ensure that the wealth was passed on to their legal descendants. Therefore, at that time, whether in civil law or church law, it was established as a sacred institution. Furthermore, in the capitalist era, the private ownership of individual property became stronger and more consolidated, and it was even more necessary to strengthen the right of inheritance. Therefore, although the bourgeois class worked hard to eliminate all feudal vestiges, they not only preserved this institution but also promoted it further. This immutable, compulsory monogamy had reached its peak in the era of industrial capitalism.</p>
<p>In this way, the bourgeois class extremely praised the sacredness of the monogamous system and used various means to defend it. But in reality, this is the most unreasonable system that sacrifices women to strengthen male dominance. Why? Because first, in the laws of the past, the right of inheritance was limited to men; second, so-called monogamy is unilaterally enforced on women, while men implicitly or openly lead a polygamous life; third, the union of monogamy itself is no longer based on pure sexual love, but on the economic subordination of women to men. Therefore, from the standpoint of us women, the so-called "sanctified" monogamy of the past is an existence in a patriarchal society that treats women as permanent slaves and permanent sacrifices.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the propertied society strictly adheres to the "sacred" monogamy and imprisons women in this sacred prison. On the other hand, it establishes a system of public prostitution to supplement men's polygamous lives. In particular, in the criminal law, it is lenient to men and strictly punishes women for the crime of adultery. As a result, women who are seduced by men and commit adultery are punished by law. This is also a symbol of monogamy in the past.</p>
<p>Monogamy in the past is a contract of lifelong enslavement of women, a legal shackle that can never be escaped except by the death or crime of the husband. In the past, women were not allowed to file for divorce from their husbands in law. This is the most important link in compulsory monogamy.</p>
<p>During the French Revolution, the bourgeois class regarded women's right to divorce as a major factor in individual freedom, and it was recognized in the law enacted by the National Assembly in September 1792. However, this law was completely overturned by Napoleon. In the era of industrial capital and financial capitalism, although the legislation on family relations varied somewhat in each country, most of it took the prohibition of women's divorce as its fundamental spirit.</p>
<p>The laws of modern Italy, Spain, and various countries in South America do not allow women to file for divorce. Even in the most liberal and advocating countries of England and the United States, although this right is stipulated in law, women must go through various troublesome procedures in order to file for divorce, [blank space] almost making it impossible to realize. Some liberal men have also come out to oppose this compulsory, lifelong monogamy, but they are all opposing from the standpoint of men, which is even more interesting. One of the opponents, Ottomarux, gave the following reasons for his opposition:</p>
<p>"Suppose I agree with my neighbor to supply one hundred piculs of potatoes on November 1st of this year, that is because I already have the means to fulfill this reservation. But if I agree to love only one woman and not [blank space] any other woman from today until twenty years later, that is tantamount to signing a contract that I cannot fulfill myself..."</p>
<p>This is the truth. In capitalist society, as long as you have money, from prostitution to adultery, you have all kinds of convenient ways to live a polygamous life.</p>
<p>We are not [blank space] for or against the monogamous [blank space] system [blank space]. We also know that the [blank space] [blank space] between the sexes is not [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] the essence of [blank space] [blank space], but must be based on individual sexual love. Therefore, monogamy itself can be said to be the most rational form of union between the sexes in human evolution. However, in the [blank space] of private property and [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] of men [blank space] [blank space], the so-called union of pure sexual love is absolutely [blank space] [blank space], and most of them are dominated by economic interests [blank space]. Monogamy [blank space] has become a lifelong prostitution contract for women. We, standing in the position of [blank space] women, have to oppose this system.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Women's Professions as Depicted in American Films</h3>
<p>— Wu Heng</p>
<p>Because of some chance encounters, I have recently seen two films for the first time in Shanghai within half a month, and I think it is very coincidental that the stories narrated in these two films both talk about the issue of women's professions. The first of these two films is "Private Worlds," starring Claudette Colbert, and the second is "Am Cover Proffession," starring [blank space] Fay [blank space].</p>
<p>Both films depict the conflict between the "private lives" of professional women and their "professions." The endings are all that the female protagonists [blank space] leave their jobs and return to being women who "live in love." Although the methods of expression are somewhat different in terms of being tactful and straightforward, they are exactly the same in denying women's participation in professional life in their conclusions.</p>
<p>The female protagonist of "Private Worlds" is a female doctor who has "decided to devote her life to her profession because her lover died an unnatural death," but her cooperation "in her profession" with another male doctor aroused the jealousy of the male doctor's wife. After a subplot, a tragedy was created—after the male doctor's wife became insane due to excessive stimulation, the hospital director began to lecture this "person with no legal responsibility." He said, "You are a constant threat to their happiness. You and McGregor (the male doctor) live in a world that Sally (the male doctor's wife) cannot participate in, so she is jealous of you. She wants to cure a crazy patient to prove to her husband that she rents you the same intelligence... Now, the only reasonable thing you can do is to quickly jump out of their lives!" As a result, the female doctor finally resigned from the hospital she did not want to leave in tears. She, like the director, thought this was "the only reasonable thing" to do. This, on the one hand, shows that even for a female doctor who has seen it all and "is determined to relieve human suffering as her profession," her dedication to her profession is far less than the passive altruism or even the concept of "self-sacrifice" (which has been considered the only virtue of women for thousands of years!) hidden in her heart. On the other hand, it clearly expresses the main idea of the play, which borrows the tone of a "female hater" to say: "In my experience, women are not suitable for the medical profession..."</p>
<p>I think the Chinese translation of the title of the second film is really too ironic. It says it is "Glorious Woman"! The story tells the story of a university graduate couple. The wife quickly becomes a famous lawyer because of her unique talent, but the husband temporarily takes the fate [blank space] of only being an employee of a construction factory. As a result, "Family happiness gradually shakes. Ba'er (the husband) feels difficult [blank space] because the family expenses are all borne by An Hen (the wife), and An Hen's affairs are complicated, and the time spent in the family is less and less..." As a result, the husband has an affair, and is arrested because of the "deviation" of this "affair." Therefore, according to the path that "farces" must have, "An Hen appeared in court to defend him, and told everyone that Ba'er's leaving home was purely due to her failure to fulfill her duties as a wife. If Ba'er is guilty of this, then the guilt should be borne by her. She also declared that she would no longer appear in court and would bid farewell to the legal career forever!" Of course, "Ba'er was finally acquitted, and soon enjoyed a great reputation in the construction industry, while An Hen devoted herself to managing the family and shared a life of sweetness with Ba'er!"</p>
<p>The intention here is very clear: women's professions will hinder family happiness, and the men's misconduct caused by women's professions should be the responsibility of women, so women should "devote themselves to managing the family" in order to "share a life of sweetness and love"! No matter how brilliant the screenwriter, director, and actors of this film are, the staleness and anti-progressiveness of this content can fully arouse the anger of knowledgeable audiences! To tell a joke, if the producers of this film were not Jewish, it could be bought by Germany for educational films.</p>
<p>The common feature of the two films is that they illustrate that women are not suitable for engaging in professions. They should be attached to men and to the family, compromising their will, suppressing their talents, and obliterating their individuality in order to maintain a "happy family" centered on men! However, despite the cleverness of the playwright, they still cannot cover up a bit of ordinary truth: the female protagonists of these [blank space] films all have their noble status. The former is the only psychiatrist in the United States, and the latter is a nationally renowned lawyer. Therefore, after they retire from the professional battle line, they still have a "sweet" and "happy" family waiting for them to return to. However, on the one hand, as we know, most of the professional women in the world today do not have such a safe "way out"! The reason they engage in professions is not for honor, status, ambition, and the competitive mentality of competing with men for a day's worth of shortfalls. The only reason that makes them have to run from the warm "family" to the competitive profession is the very ordinary "for the sake of living!" To live, they came out of the family, to live, they have created a kind of qualification in spirit and body that can compete with men, so in them, it is actually different from the two happy female protagonists mentioned above. They cannot reluctantly "sacrifice themselves," nor do they have unnecessary "self-blame." Their philosophy is very simple, what they want to do and can do is just the duty that "a person" should do.</p>
<p>We feel that the behavior of these two Heromes is a kind of psychological "luxury"! Therefore, their "spiritual tragedy" is not shared by ordinary professional women.</p>

<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>At this time, my sister-in-law brought a [blank space] [blank space] [blank space], put it on the table:</p>
<p>"Sister! Have a bowl of hot tea... Sigh, when your brother first left; he said he lived on Yanghuo Street. How far is the place where you live from Yanghuo Street!" My sister-in-law was holding her youngest child, and two other children were following behind her.</p>
<p>The whole room was almost filled with darkness, with only a bean oil lamp lit. The light was as big as a firefly, and the wick was lying tiredly in the oil lamp.</p>
<p>Mother approached the lamp stand and turned the wick up a bit, and the firelight shone a little brighter, revealing the edge of Mother's sleeve. She sat down on the edge of the bed, put her hands in her vest, and murmured:</p>
<p>"The older you get, the harder it is to be a human being. Last year I got sick, and your sister-in-law didn't even come to see me. When I was sleeping in bed with a high fever and couldn't get up, your sister-in-law brought the child in. I thought she came to take care of me, but who knew that as soon as she came in, the first thing she said was: 'Mother-in-law! Keep your mind clear, you have to know, if you die, I don't have money to take you out'! Mother suddenly shed tears, wiping them with her rough old palm.</p>
<p>Xiuzhen sat quietly in the quilt, listening silently, sometimes thinking about the dirty and black tent top covered with rat droppings, her eyes felt extremely tired. She also looked at her mother, wanting to say a few words of comfort, but couldn't say anything. She had to sit silently and listen to her mother:</p>
<p>"I'm old after all. Last time I went to the temple to worship the Bodhisattva, I don't know how I fell. You think I'm not good for walking anymore. My eyes were originally very good, although I'm old, I can still thread fine needles. But since your father died, I've been crying every day, and that ruined my eyesight. You think what am I crying about! I'm crying for my food! Your brother can't earn money, and your sister-in-law is so fierce and doesn't understand reason... but it's no wonder, she's dragging three children, it's really hard enough for her. I'm feeling depressed and shedding tears, so my left eye is blind. Bitter! My flesh! Mother suddenly covered her left eye, "That way I can't see things clearly. You're over there, and I see you like a pile of black something, I can't tell your nose and eyes, and I can't tell if it's a pile of quilts or a person." She put her hands back in her vest, shaking her head a few times, expressing infinite sigh.</p>
<p>At this time, Xiuzhen wanted to comfort her again, but she couldn't always say the most appropriate word. Later, I don't know how [blank space] I found such a sentence:</p>
<p>"How's elder sister?"</p>
<h3>Regarding the "Statue of Liberty" and "Women's Life" Matters</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>"Women's Life" was originally intended to give preferential treatment to readers. Shanghai Magazine Company and Diantong Film Company specially negotiated that anyone holding an order for "Women's Life" can enjoy the right to visit when the "Statue of Liberty" is screened. This news was originally intended to be published in the newspaper on the 16th, but due to the delay in printing, the advertisement had to be postponed. As a result, many readers suspected that the news of "Women's Garden" on the 14th was a false report, and some even held the "Women's Life" order to Shanghai Magazine Company for strict negotiation. It is now heard that as soon as the gift certificate is printed, it will be announced in the newspaper, and readers do not need to worry. Furthermore, the special price of "Women's Life" (90 cents for half a year, 1.2 yuan for the whole year) was originally scheduled to end at the end of this month. Now, in order to re-treat readers preferentially, it has also been decided to postpone it for half a month.</p>

<p>The "intercommunication of existence and non-existence" spoken of here is not the so-called "intercommunication of existence and non-existence" in the secular sense of wealth, but the philosophical question of the concepts of existence and non-existence and their interrelationship. Philosophically, existence and non-existence, from an abstract concept, mean existence is existence, and non-existence is non-existence. In the usual conception, that is, in the general intuitive understanding of human beings, they are separated from the actual changes of things: existence is pure, fixed and unchanging existence, it is pure existence; non-existence is also pure, fixed and unchanging non-existence, it is pure non-existence. According to this general understanding of the concept of existence and non-existence, existence and non-existence, in an abstract sense, are fixed and uncertain, identical and cannot be transformed into absolute opposites. Because when we only think abstractly of a certain existence, that is, thinking of an existence, this in imagination means that its content is always equal to itself, neither more nor less, and cannot be missed in the slightest. Otherwise, even if it is partially reduced or disappears, it is not the original existence, not the original existence. Therefore, such existence is fixed and permanently equal to itself. But this can only be said in an abstract sense. If such existence is to be placed on real things, that is, to be connected to concrete things, then because concrete things are constantly changing, there is no absolutely no gain or loss and permanently identical content, so such existence does not exist. Because of this, the fixed abstract concept of existence, precisely because of its fixed and unchanging nature, has no gain, loss, increase, decrease, or difference different from itself, so it cannot incorporate the content of concrete things into it. It can only refer to the existence in the image with pure abstract content, and this existence becomes a concept of uncertain and unrealistic content. Conversely, the general concept of so-called non-existence is also the same. Non-existence is simply emptiness, it is nothing, and its content is pure non-existence. In its contentless state, it is completely and permanently equal to itself, and cannot be increased or decreased, or even changed. Because change must produce something. If it is said that non-existence is only transformed into non-existence, this is just meaningless repetition of words, and has no meaning at all. However, if non-existence is to become a meaningful change, then it is to produce existence from non-existence, which is not the general understanding of non-existence. From this, it can be seen that the general abstract concept of non-existence, like existence, is fixed and permanently identical to itself. However, such non-existence can only refer to an abstract and pure concept, and cannot be connected with real and concrete things. Because concrete and real things are changing. Things that do not exist today can be produced tomorrow, and existence is produced from non-existence, and non-existence is transformed into existence. This is a common phenomenon. Therefore, if the absolute form of non-existence is to be maintained, it can only be made absolutely empty, so that it can be applied in any general occasion. That is to say, the concept of the absolute fixity of abstract non-existence, like the concept of abstract existence, becomes an uncertain thing at the same time due to its fixed and unchanging permanent identity, because it cannot have a definite concrete and realistic content. From this point of view, abstract concepts of non-existence also have commonality and opposition. The point of their identity lies in the fact that they all belong to a kind of fixed and uncertain empty image or concept: the point of their opposition lies in the fact that they are absolute concepts that cannot be transformed into each other due to their fixity, which is the general so-called concept of existence and non-existence. Such concepts of existence and non-existence are absolutely incompatible concepts, and in their abstract and empty sense, they cannot have realistic applicability.</p>
<p>Those concepts that are sufficient to explain the existence and non-existence of reality and concrete things, although they are also opposed, their opposition is not absolute, but can be transformed into each other; they are mutually formed and interconnected, and there is no permanently insurmountable gap in the middle. It is meaningless and incomprehensible to talk about existence and non-existence completely apart from real and concrete things. Because how can we explain an existence? This requires real existence, the existence of concrete things. Without all real and concrete things, the concept of existence cannot occur at all. In an absolutely empty universe, we can not only not talk about existence and existence, but also cannot prove that there is existence and existence. However, if there is no existence at all, we cannot imagine a non-existence, because there is nothing in the universe at all, how can we imagine and confirm a non-existence in the opposite aspect of existence? Conversely, how can we explain a non-existence? This requires that the real and concrete things have non-existence in existence. The things that exist today will disappear and no longer exist in their original state tomorrow, so the concept of non-existence occurs. If things in the universe always exist as they are, without any disappearance, that is, without any time when they do not exist, in this absolutely solidified and fulfilled universe, we can not only not talk about non-existence and non-existence, but also cannot prove the existence and non-existence. However, if there is absolutely no non-existence, we cannot imagine an existence either, because there is no so-called non-existence in the universe at all, how can we imagine and confirm an existence in the opposite aspect of non-existence? From this point of view, existence is established in relation to non-existence, and non-existence is also established in relation to existence. Existence is needed to describe a non-existence, and non-existence is also needed to describe an existence; the existence of existence simultaneously contains non-existence, and the existence of non-existence also simultaneously contains existence. The two opposing poles can only exist in the coexistence of the opposites. This is just like the interdependence of yin and yang electromagnetic poles. Without a positive electromagnetic pole, there is no negative electromagnetic pole, and without a negative electromagnetic pole, there is no positive electromagnetic pole. Without repulsive force, there is no attraction, and without attraction, there is no repulsive force. Without potential energy, there is no kinetic energy, and without kinetic energy, there is no potential energy, etc., the opposites depend on each other.</p>
<p>Not only that, existence and non-existence must depend on matter to exist, because the change of matter is a necessary condition for the generation of existence and non-existence. However, matter is constantly changing. This change is from existence to non-existence, and from non-existence to existence. Therefore, existence directly produces non-existence from the change of matter, and non-existence also directly produces existence from the change of matter. The fact is the proof of the theory. The solar system did not exist since ancient times. It was non-existence before it was established. However, the solar system was not born out of thin air, that is, not from absolute emptiness. It was formed by the original nebula. That is to say, the nebula disappeared and the solar system was produced. The disappearance of the nebula is from existence to non-existence, that is, from existence to non-existence, and the production of the solar system is from non-existence to existence, that is, from non-existence to existence. However, the disappearance of the nebula to non-nebula, and the birth of the existing solar system from the non-solar system, that is, the birth of non-existence from existence and the birth of existence from non-existence, are not the absolute disappearance of matter but only changes, nor are they the birth of existence from absolute emptiness, but still only material changes. Therefore, existence and non-existence only shift each other and communicate with each other in material changes. Material changes cause the existing to disappear, and there must be existence before there is disappearance. This is the birth of non-existence from existence, and there must be existence to give birth to non-existence. Material changes cause what was originally non-existent to grow up, and there must be what was originally non-existent before there is so-called new birth. This is the birth of existence from non-existence, and there must be non-existence to give birth to existence. Without disappearance, there is no growth, and without growth, there is no disappearance. Therefore, in the birth of existence from non-existence and non-existence containing existence, and the birth of non-existence from existence and existence containing non-existence, not only do existence and non-existence become opposing at any time, but also they can only exist in opposition. Moreover, there is a universe of all things only under the alternating cycle of existence and non-existence. Therefore, existence and non-existence are not absolutely opposed and unconnected. They grow the whole world in the unity of opposites, and they also establish the basis for the unity of their own opposition in the change of matter.</p>

<p>Celebrity Interview</p>
<h3>Ying Yunwei</h3>
<p>— Yu Shaotang</p>
<p>In the director's office of Yihua, there were more than a dozen luxurious desks scattered around; each desk had a rectangular enamel sign with a blue background and white characters, on which the name of each director was engraved.</p>
<p>A burst of hurried leather shoes sounds came in.</p>
<p>"Director Ying is here!" One of the people who was writing laughed.</p>
<p>"Listening to his loud leather shoes, he is indeed worthy of being a "hero of the hour"!" Another person continued.</p>
<p>"Haha..." This sentence made everyone in the room laugh.</p>
<p>"Isn't that a bit too much?" Just as everyone was laughing, a fair face appeared at the door of the director's office, standing there silently with a smile on his face; staring motionlessly at the many faces whose smiles had not yet faded. After a while, probably realizing that there was a stranger like me sitting and waiting for him next to his desk, he restrained his smile and walked in, casually put a very thick script on the machine, and greeted me humbly: "This is Mr. ×? Hey! It's so hot, I really don't deserve to trouble you to come here." He spoke fluent Mandarin, as if reciting lines; the fair face showed the same joy as before.</p>
<p>"I wanted to visit Mr. Ying a long time ago, but I never had the opportunity; I recently heard that you directed another "Hero of the Hour", so I took this opportunity to visit."</p>
<p>"I dare not say visit, if there is a chance, I hope you can give me more advice; but today's play is probably going to disappoint you because the set hasn't been built yet." He said apologetically.</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter, there will be many more opportunities to visit in the future;" I hurriedly interjected: "But can Mr. Ying tell me about his past life in theater and film today?"</p>
<p>"If you want to know, of course I can tell you as much as possible; but I always feel that there is nothing worth saying." The expression on his face was full of theatrical elements; sometimes his relaxed and humorous expression would make people laugh involuntarily.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ying has been involved in theater for many years, right?" I felt that this question was very naive; but without bringing up a clue like this, it would make him feel a kind of difficulty in starting.</p>
<p>"I first became interested in theater in the year of the "May Fourth" Movement; I was only sixteen years old at the time, and I was studying at × Middle School. The thinking of the general youth students was naturally bound to change in the vortex of that great movement; so new literature and drama became the love of the general youth."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ying was naturally one of those who loved drama at that time, right?" I interjected to add a sentence for him.</p>
<p>"Yes," he smiled, "but I didn't officially act at that time. The national environment at that time was also almost as bad as it is now. The general awakened young students felt that the national crisis was deepening, and it was not enough to save the current crisis without awakening the people; so the young students of each school came out one after another, working day and night to give speeches everywhere. I remember once giving a costumed speech at the Youth Association, I played a "bad guy", and was beaten by the audience, and after that I didn't dare to play this kind of role again. But that beating gave me a new understanding of drama; I began to feel the power of drama's appeal, sometimes even making the audience forget themselves. ... Later, the interest in acting became more and more intense, and as long as there was an opportunity to act in the school, I would never be missing."</p>
<p>"What kind of role is Mr. Ying's personality suitable for?"</p>
<p>"At that time, acting was not about whether the personality was suitable or not, you could play whatever you liked; but many people were always unwilling to play women, so when there was this kind of role, I would always take care of it. Later, when the China Vocational High School first performed "Hero and Beauty", I was invited to play a female role in the secondary performance because I was a bit famous for playing women in the school; this was my first formal stage play, and the result was considered to have won a better criticism."</p>
<p>"After that, your interest in drama must have increased even more, right?" I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Needless to say? But later, I not only wanted to increase my own interest in drama, but also wanted to come up with many ways to increase the number of people who loved drama; no matter which school held a carnival, I would always volunteer to rehearse for them. The result of each carnival performance always got a lot of good reviews; therefore, the authorities of each school paid special attention to drama, and as long as a carnival was held, there would always be a program of drama performances." The proud smile unfolded on his face again.</p>
<p>"Mr. Ying has made great contributions to the history of drama." I said flatteringly.</p>
<p>"I dare not say that I have made contributions, but since I am interested in drama, I might as well "extend it to others" and hope to do more for drama. However, I did receive a lot of stimulation in order to engage in theatrical activities at that time; because acting at that time, not only the stage technology was not up to par, but even a better script was not available. The drama performances in the general school carnivals mostly had only a facade but no script, and the acting skills of the general actors were even worse than the civilized drama of today. So although there were many people who liked to watch plays at that time, the audience looked down on drama actors as "actors" because the skills were too low. I was one of the more famous actors at that time, so my general relatives and friends were dissatisfied with me. Because I wanted to act, my current wife once asked me for a divorce, and the agency I worked for also fired me, but the blows of being lovelorn and unemployed still could not drag me back from the path of drama." He clenched his fist and drew a semi-circle in the air, showing a very determined look.</p>
<p>"But, Mr. Ying couldn't even exchange acting for bread at that time, how did you maintain your personal life?" I pressed.</p>
<p>"After I left school, I worked on the one hand and engaged in theatrical activities on the other, so I didn't have to worry about my life. But as I said just now, there was a period when I was forced to lose my job because people didn't understand the greatness of drama. During that period of unemployment, the material life was naturally under extreme pressure, but the spiritual life was reduced a lot of pain. Soon, the status of drama in society gradually improved, and my employment problem was solved at this time. The agency I served this time was Zhao Xing Shipping Company; it seems a bit incongruous for someone who likes to act to run a shipping business, and people generally expected that I would not be able to do it, but things will always be unexpected. I served the company with the spirit of acting, and spent more than a dozen years there, until last year when I officially joined the film industry did I announce my departure from the shipping life.</p>
<p>"The fact that drama can now occupy a considerable force in society is still due to the efforts of the general people who engaged in theatrical movement in those days, because although the social environment of drama at that time was bad, they still worked hard without regard to anything. Later, Hong Shen returned from the United States and joined the Drama Association to rehearse "The Shrew" and "Good Son", and opened a new record in drama, and began to have scripts to act; and he was also engaged in drama as a student studying abroad, so the social concept of drama was very different from before. Another surprising thing is that from that time on, a group of female comrades such as Qian Jianqiu also boldly joined the Drama Association; Qian Jianqiu played a female role in "The Shrew" directed by Hong Shen, and was successful in technique after the performance. After this group of female comrades joined, playing female roles was considered to be invisibly canceled; but later everyone discovered that to make the drama realistic, the stage setting was very important, and from that time on, I changed from acting in front of the stage to the "supervisor" behind the scenes. Then, Ouyang Yuqian wrote and directed "The Young Lady's Fan" and "The Doll Family", which were all sensational for a while, and also had considerable achievements in technique. The first play I directed was "The Second Dream" co-directed with Hong Shen; soon after, Hong Shen and Ouyang Yuqian both left the Drama Association due to incidents, and almost all of the later plays were directed by me."</p>
<p>"Among the plays that Mr. Ying has recently performed, which one is the most successful?"</p>
<p>"I dare not say that. ..." He laughed again, "But I myself think that the majority of the plays directed for the general girls' schools are more satisfying; as for the stage performances, "Roar, China!" is probably a better one."</p>
<p>"Mr. Ying joined the film industry from directing "Roar, China!" at that time, right?"</p>
<p>"No, in fact, before directing this play, many friends advised me to join the film industry, but on the one hand, because the shipping company I served was unwilling for me to leave, and on the other hand, I also hoped that engaging in art did not necessarily have to be professionalized, so I did not accept the kindness of my friends. After "Roar, China!" was performed, many friends again advised me to join the film industry, thinking that doing so would give me many opportunities to develop my personality. At the same time, I also felt a little tired of the shipping life of more than a dozen years, so I joined the newly emerging film company Yihua. Not long after entering Yihua, I wrote a script, but because there were too many plays being filmed at the same time, there was not enough glass sheds, so I had to be idle. Coincidentally, Diantong Company rose up at this time, so they discussed with Yihua and let me direct a "Peach and Plum Tribulation" for them first. After this film came out, although it won the praise of some people, it was still due to the efforts of the general actors, and I myself had no merit to be proud of."</p>
<p>"Can the remuneration for directing "Peach and Plum Tribulation" also be made public?" I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Why not?" He waved his hand indifferently and rushed to say, "The directing fee for this film was 1,200 yuan."</p>
<p>"Is the remuneration for the "Hero of the Hour" that you are currently directing also that much?"</p>
<p>"No, this is about monthly salary, 180 yuan per month, and if the film makes money, you can also get some remuneration."</p>
<p>"Then Mr. Ying's life is very comfortable, right?" I asked jokingly.</p>
<p>"I can't say that I'm comfortable. I thought I could earn this much money in the shipping company; but I didn't join the film industry because I was greedy for the high salary!" He also laughed.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge</p>
<h3>Iron and Mankind</h3>
<p>— Gu Beixuan</p>
<p>Iron is extremely important to mankind. Firstly, from a physiological standpoint, every young person's red blood cells contain 0.2% iron. If a person's body lacks iron, not only will their skin lack color, but their life cannot be sustained. The reason many doctors and scientists often advise us to eat more spinach and other vegetables is because they contain the most iron. Iron can be said to be the most important and indispensable element in the human body. Secondly, in modern people's daily lives, iron is also very important. Without iron, we could not manufacture trains, ships, airplanes, and automobiles, making it impossible for us to move swiftly. Furthermore, we could not sew clothes, cook food, or build houses, leading to problems with clothing, food, and shelter. Thus, we can also say that iron is an indispensable part of our lives; without it, we simply cannot live. However, if you have some knowledge of human evolutionary history, you will know that our earliest ancestors did not know that there was iron in the universe. Even relatively advanced nomadic peoples had no connection with iron in their lives. All the utensils they used were made of stone, so historians call their era the Stone Age.</p>
<p>After the Stone Age, humans gradually learned to use metal to make weapons and tools. But the first metal discovered by humans was not iron, but bronze. Bronze is a mixture of tin and copper. According to general historians' speculation, the discovery of bronze and its use by humans to make weapons and other things was caused by the nomadic peoples' need to improve their weapons in frequent wars. As for humans using iron to make tools, it was after the Bronze Age. According to Wells's speculation, the earliest users of iron were also nomadic peoples. The basis for this speculation is, of course, the fact that nomadic peoples needed to continuously improve their weapons in constant warfare.</p>
<p>Iron mined from iron ore, according to our current common sense, must be tempered in fire to be useful. But humans did not easily learn how to refine iron with fire. According to general historians' speculation, it was initially due to volcanic eruptions that naturally tempered the iron hidden in the mountains, and then humans learned how to refine iron with fire, and began to use wood and charcoal to refine pig iron. In the beginning, humans did not have iron smelting furnaces, so they had to dig a hole in the mountains, burn charcoal in it, and then put the iron in for tempering. In this way, the wind power in the hole was insufficient and the firepower was limited, so the iron produced was certainly not very good. Later, due to the needs of life, humans invented simple iron smelting furnaces and bellows, and then humans could gradually use iron to make general tools, and evolved from the Stone Age and Bronze Age to the Iron Age.</p>
<p>Humans who had evolved to the Iron Age gradually realized that iron was the most beneficial material for mankind among all metals. It can be arbitrarily lengthened, bent, and made into hard or soft objects. It can be made into iron bars, iron wire, iron needles, iron knives, iron spears... and other things. Iron is extremely important for industry, agriculture, art, science, and war. Therefore, the use of iron increased daily, and the need for it became more urgent. The original early iron mining methods and iron smelting furnaces increasingly proved to be inapplicable. Thus, around the sixteenth century, German iron manufacturers modified the original iron smelting furnaces, making them higher and larger, and closing the furnace mouth. By the end of the sixteenth century, someone further improved this type of iron smelting furnace, allowing it to break away from its original form. However, the fuel for iron smelting was originally charcoal. Because the need for iron increased daily and iron smelting technology improved, this fuel for iron smelting became increasingly scarce. In seventeenth and eighteenth-century Europe, many forests were felled due to the urgent need for fuel. In the early eighteenth century, England even passed laws in parliament restricting iron manufacturing in order to prevent the complete destruction of local forests. After a period of time, in 1735, the British iron manufacturer Darby tried using coal as fuel, and the result was very good. Thus, charcoal was driven out of the iron smelting furnace by coal. Later, the Englishman Neilson greatly reformed the iron manufacturing method and invented the principle of blowing hot air into the iron smelting furnace. This stimulated a large increase in iron production, and iron production technology developed rapidly. Iron bridges, iron roads, iron pipes, ships, trains, and other modern manufactured products gradually appeared, and the foundation of so-called modern civilization was laid.</p>
<p>With the evolution of human society, in the mid-nineteenth century, Bessemer invented a new method of steelmaking. Steel is simply iron that contains a small amount of carbon. Before Bessemer, humans already knew how to make steel, but the methods used were not sophisticated and not widespread. Since Bessemer's steelmaking method was invented, the iron and steel industry has become increasingly widespread and developed. In 1858, he invented the so-called Bessemer converter, and from then on, the iron and steel industry has been greatly developed and has had a significant impact on people's lives. Not to mention anything else, just look at the warships, tanks, and other lethal weapons that various countries now have, which are almost all made of steel. Without steel, I am afraid that we would not be able to see many wonderful and harmful things.</p>
<p>The above is a simple process of the historical development of the relationship between humans and iron. From this, we can not only see the importance of iron to mankind, but also, from an evolutionary point of view, we can say that the evolution of mankind in the past has evolved with the progress of mankind's conquest of iron.</p>
<p>Up to now, we can say that the strength, wealth, and level of civilization of a country are directly proportional to its iron production. As everyone knows, the United States is the most developed capitalist country, but according to statistics in 1929, the world's pig iron production was 96.18 million tons, of which the United States accounted for 43.1 million tons, ranking first in the world. The total steel production was 118 million tons, of which the United States accounted for 55 million tons, accounting for about half of the total. In addition, the steel industries of other advanced countries in the world, such as Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Soviet Russia, are also very developed. As for our country, it is known as "vast in territory and abundant in resources," and its iron production is also very abundant. Provinces such as Jiangsu, Hubei, and Sichuan all have large deposits of iron ore. Unfortunately, because our country's industry is not developed, the large deposits of iron ore buried in the country have not been mined. Even if they have been mined, their sovereignty is mostly controlled by foreigners, which is not only not beneficial to our country, but also harmful. If we want to catch up with the advanced countries in the world, we must take back the iron ore rights and all other rights that have been lost from foreigners, develop the undeveloped iron ore and all other important minerals, embark on a new iron age, and further leap to a scientific electrical age.</p>

<h3>Guidance for Further Education</h3>
<p>— Lin Xian</p>
<p>Symposium for Teachers and Parents of Graduates</p>
<p>Teacher: Good luck to everyone; your sons and daughters are graduating this semester. I should first extend my congratulations to you all.</p>
<p>Poor Parent A: What is there to congratulate? You should only congratulate the parents of those truly fortunate children—fortunate children who have wealthy parents with property. After they graduate, their parents will choose a well-managed middle school for them to attend for further education. Perhaps after the children receive their graduation diplomas, they can also receive additional delicious and fun prizes from their loving parents! But my child——</p>
<p>Teacher: We naturally do not need to dream of the bourgeois lifestyle now, but do you have any plans for your child's future?</p>
<p>Parent A: Where can we talk about plans? Having plans requires money.</p>
<p>Teacher: ……</p>
<p>Parent A: What will happen to the child in the future? Yes, what should happen to the child in the future? Further education? Look, people like me, a poor parent, can barely make ends meet for the family's food and clothing. Where do I have the strength to send the child to further education? Tell him to learn a craft, to be an apprentice? He's not even twelve or thirteen years old, and my child is so short. He can't stand behind a counter, can't hold an ax, and doesn't have good relatives or friends. Who would recommend him and act as his guarantor? Alas, alas, it's easy to raise a child, but hard to educate one!</p>
<p>Teacher: Mr. A, I don't think you need to say these things. Parents naturally only have to be responsible for their children, fulfill their obligations, and the only heavenly duty of parents is education! Your son is also intelligent and should be well cultivated so that he will stand out in the future.</p>
<p>Parent A: You're joking! I understand the heavenly duty of parents, but in recent years, the market has been sluggish, the fields have not produced good spring crops, there have been rebellions and famines. In this day and age, not accumulating debt is already considered a good year. Where do I have extra money to cultivate my child's education!</p>
<p>Teacher: According to what you said, if your child doesn't pursue further education and has no way to find employment, it's really harming him by graduating. It's really unexpected! Okay, we'll think of a solution later! Mr. B, your son probably wants to find a middle school to cultivate himself!</p>
<p>Stubborn Parent B: Further education is not very meaningful! Didn't Li Yingbiao's eldest son spend thousands of dollars to graduate from some famous university in Beijing? But look, isn't he still at home eating his parents' rice? I see through it all. Besides, my child is already older. He's seventeen years old this year. There are few people in the family. His grandmother and mother want to find him a marriage. Now the Wang family in the east village has sent a "card," and the Li family also has a "matchmaker." If it's destined, I want to arrange a marriage. As a parent, that would be fulfilling a wish.</p>
<p>Teacher: Mr. B is wrong. Graduating from university does not necessarily mean having a job. Formal graduation does not determine whether or not one has real skills. Having skills and whether or not someone needs them is also a problem. In China, there are not enough places for true talents to be employed. Exams are not yet widespread, and talents are not used for their intended purpose. Even the fact that talents are buried is indeed everywhere. But we must not give up eating because of choking. As I just said, parents' education of their children is just a duty that should be fulfilled. Although we should guide our children to take the right path, parents should only know how to cultivate and not ask about the harvest! I think Mr. B's idea is wrong. The heavenly duty of parents is education, but the marriage of children does not need to be interfered with by parents. Marriage is the children's own business, and they will naturally solve it themselves when they are older.</p>
<p>Parent A: Mr. × is right. Mr. B, you don't have to disbelieve Mr. ×'s words. Speaking of the marriage of children, it is naturally a troublesome thing for parents. It is said that the new law stipulates that "marriage is based on the principle of autonomy of the parties." The words of parents and matchmakers are no longer valid. Besides, haven't you seen Peng Shenfu's son making a fuss over the marriage issue? Why should parents suffer! My idea is that Mr. B's family is well-off, so you should let your son pursue further education. Since you have money to hold a wedding for your son, you might as well use this money to send your son to school! I, to be honest, have the will but not the power, alas! My child doesn't have as good fortune as your child! I only hate myself for not being ambitious and for hurting my children...</p>
<p>Teacher: That's right, Mr. A's opinion is good! ... Now we want to hear Mr. C's opinion.</p>
<p>Parent C with many children: Thank you for asking for my opinion. To be honest with you, I have seven children in total, four sons and three daughters. The eldest son and second son are studying at university, the third daughter, fourth son, and fifth son are studying at middle school. Except for the seventh daughter, who is still studying in elementary school, the sixth daughter graduated from elementary school this year. However, the education fees I pay for my children every year exceed 1,000 yuan. It really fulfills the saying "being a horse for one's children." I think I'll let the sixth daughter do housework at home. First, women should practice household chores. Second, I can take a breath. Third, girls are not like boys. Even if they read books, they may not become female officials or work in offices. Once they marry a man, they will just accompany their husbands and raise sons, and that's it? Besides, if you read too many books, you won't make progress in other things, but your horizons will be broadened. You won't do household chores. So I'm really worried about my third daughter. I don't know if this mother and daughter will be the same?</p>
<p>Parent A: Mr. C can educate six or seven children, while I can't even educate one child. I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed!</p>
<p>Teacher: Mr. A, you don't have to be discouraged. Mr. C's words are also worth discussing. Mr. C pointed out the weaknesses of female education, which I admire. So I think whether female education should be run in the same way as male education, and even whether the current aristocratic girls' schools are reasonable, are worth serious study. But in principle, I think the educational opportunities for men and women should be equal. Men can love advanced education, so why can't women? I personally sympathize with Mr. C's heavy burden, but I don't think that women don't need to receive the same advanced education as men.</p>
<p>Parent B: Indeed, Mr. C's financial ability is still able to bear it. In terms of responsibility, your daughter should pursue further education.</p>
<p>Parent C: Too many children... can't manage...</p>
<p>Teacher: The more children, the heavier the parents' responsibility! However——</p>
<p>Parent A: Not to say unpleasant things in front of Mr. C, it's okay for you, Mr. C, to have more children. Generally, irresponsible parents who have no ability also have large groups of children without restraint. Since society has no public education methods, they neither raise nor educate them. They wander the streets all day long, and in the future, they will all be a burden on society.</p>
<p>Teacher: So I think the theory of abstinence is still worth promoting and publicizing in the lower classes! ... Mr. C, I think your daughter's future is also bright. The higher a person's intelligence and skills, the better!</p>
<p>Parent C: I agree that the educational opportunities for men and women should not be biased, but I think my daughter should learn a practical skill. The courses in general schools are too superficial. Mr. ×, do you think so?</p>
<p>Teacher: Yes.</p>
<p>Parent C: Mr. A's son should also go to school. We should all think of ways to help Mr. A do our part.</p>
<p>Teacher and Parent B: Of course, of course. We should not only help Mr. A's son, but we should also help all talented and promising children!</p>

<h3>After Viewing the Third Photography Exhibition of the Black and White Society</h3>
<p>— Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>These few days were initially intermittently rainy, occasionally sunny, or even scorching hot. However, we could often see the wonderful postures of the ever-changing summer clouds and the brilliant brocade-like sunset glow. If there was an opportunity to go to the suburbs, the lush trees would greet people with smiling faces along the way; the green seedlings in the paddy fields were also strangely cute. However, driven by food and clothing, the professional groups still gathered in the city, and even most people could not get a moment of leisure for recreation. Among them, although there were sometimes noisy and pressing night gardens, everyone regarded them as the only destination for relaxing their body and mind. There were also those who reproduced the artistic techniques of cultivating temperament and comforting depression; such as movies, stage plays, art exhibitions, etc.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was attracted by several touching and interesting advertisements revealed by the Black and White Photography Society. I excitedly ran to the northern part of the sixth floor of the Continental Commercial Center to visit. This exhibition hall had windows on all three sides, and the bright, high-up view made people forget that they were in Shanghai, "where buildings hide the setting sun." In addition, the suitable layout and the simple and clean equipment gave visitors a pleasant feeling everywhere, so many people lingered, each in a situation where they hesitated to leave.</p>
<p>A total of 268 photographs were displayed in the entire venue. It is said that they were strictly selected from more than 1,400 works collected by all members of the society. The society currently has 89 members; 58 of them had their works displayed. The most exhibits by an individual were 37, and the least was only one. Each exhibit was attached with a label, stating what kind of camera was used to shoot and what kind of paper was used to print, which could be used as a reference for observation and research.</p>
<p>The most numerous works were still landscapes. The scenery of nature was already worth appreciating; added with the artistic skills of tailoring, making the angle appropriate, even more emphasized the moving pictures. Such as Mr. Zhang Jingyan's "Ancient Temple in Pine Shade," Mr. Hua Huaiqi's "Mountain Carriage," Mr. Su Jinyuan's "Sign of a Bountiful Year," Mr. Lu Shifu's "Great Rivers and Mountains," "Full Load," Mr. Lu Fu's "A Song of Guanshan, a Light Boat for Thousands of Miles," Mr. Ding Shengbao's "Rain is Coming,"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Laosheng's "Vast Sea of Clouds," Mr. Xiang Huian's "Twilight," Mr. Ao Enhong's "Moonlit Jiangjian," Mr. Xu Dexian's "Sunset," Mr. Zhou Songxian's "Gurgling," Mr. Chen Chuanlin's "Willows in Front of the Pagoda Reflect a Lonely Boat," "Yanghan Mountain," Mr. Ye Qianyu's "Fallen Leaves," Mr. Nie Guangdi's "Lonely Boat and Moonlight," Mr. Luo Jingyu's "Lushan Clouds," Mr. Luo Gusun's "Bridge," Mr. Situ Huai's "Fisherman's Song," etc., the encountered scenery, time, and photography experience, just a few combinations, and they formed a series of works that made people yearn for them. The next most numerous were portraits and works centered on characters: such as Mr. Wu Yinxi's "Waiting for a Kiss," Mr. Ye Qianyu's "Boat Girl," Mr. Lu Fu's "Rice Field," Mr. Shen Yubing's "(Unfettered Talent," Mr. Chen Chuanlin's "Returning Together," Mr. Chen Jingde's "A Hair's Breadth," "Youthful Activity," Mr. Ding Shengbao's "Departure," Mr. Xiang Huian's "Dragon's Skills," Mr. Wang Jue's "Washing Vegetables," Mr. Wang Yuhuai's "Beautiful Eyes and Pretty Cheeks," Mr. Hu Runsheng's "Welcoming God's Festival," Mr. Ji Heming's "Fishing," Mr. Chen Jinshi's "Labor Cave," Mr. Luo Jingyu's "Listening to Instructions," Mr. Lu Shifu's "Stranded," etc., made us feel that this human phenomenon is really unpredictable, and it can really be made a big deal out of a small thing, or a small deal out of a big thing, and we feel that life reflected in art is more interesting and deeper. Taking flowers, birds, animals, insects, and fish as subjects, such as Mr. Wu Zhonghang's "Loving Couple," "Tiger's Gaze," "Blackbirds Flying South," Mr. Mao Songyou's "Leisurely and Content," Mr. Nie Guangdi's "Wushan Dance," Mr. Situ Bo's "Crane Dance," etc., probably all rely on paying attention everywhere, and the opportunity is coincidental, the so-called "the article is naturally formed, and the wonderful hand is occasionally obtained"? But if it is not used properly, it will definitely be missed!</p>
<p>There are several very special works, which should be attributed to the author's Qiuhe in his chest and the agility of his thoughts: such as Mr. Wang Yuhuai's "The Earth is Divided into Domains," Mr. Ding Shengbao's "Umbrella, Umbrella, Umbrella," Mr. Wang Pengzhe's "High Buildings and People Gone," Mr. Wang Junxian's "Whistle," Mr. Bian Zhixiang's "Wine," Mr. Wu Yinxi's "Bubble," Mr. Cui Ding's "Lotus Coin," Mr. Yao Zhonglu's "Nine Out of Ten Empty," Mr. Gui Jiying's</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Mr. Gui Jiying's "Machine," Mr. Xu Yanying's "Also Has Strings," Mr. Huang Chongye's "Phantom," Mr. Chen Chuanlin's "Fleeting," Mr. Chen Jinshi's "Blooming," Mr. Ye Qianyu's "Singing Shirt," Mr. Lu Shifu's "Emerging Lotus," Mr. Lu Yu's "Continuous Interlacing," Mr. Nie Guangdi's "Ladder," etc.</p>
<p>I remember that many of the works have already been seen in some art magazines, but they are always a little different after being made into plates. I am very happy to be able to see the original works this time. But in addition to expressing admiration, I would also like to offer some opinions: (1) I think that China's photographic art is just sprouting and growing, and many interested people are suffering from lack of experience and guidance, so I hope that every photography exhibition will have some meaning of guiding the younger generation, and each work must indicate the time and shutter speed at that time. If it is possible to attach the original work—referring to the original small-size print that has not been enlarged—next to it, it would be even better. (2) Attach the original work without cropping, and an explanation of how to crop and the reason for cropping; of course, sometimes a photograph, the whole and the part are desirable.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone who studies art should develop their personality as much as possible—innate talent and experience, the accumulation of wisdom, but it may be shared with the public as guidance and a mirror.</p>
<p>I know that the above feelings are very shallow, and I can only use "the words of Mr. Dinaiho" revealed in the special issue of the Black and White Society as an excuse: "The ability of appreciation is understanding and recognition, but the depth of understanding and the breadth of recognition depend on the talent of each appreciator!"</p>
<p>The future of the Black and White Society will certainly be even more progressive. We hope that it can more universally enable the public to understand and recognize it more deeply. This is also the responsibility that the Black and White Society should fulfill—just like the responsibility of the entire art world.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Around the World (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>"Batavia, Moro, Anjou, and the islands of Banten all need to increase their population. They should also be given wealth so they can generate profits for the country. Among the world's peoples, none are better suited for our use than the Chinese. Since trade cannot be achieved peacefully, we should take advantage of this monsoon season to have warships spy on China, capturing men, women, and children and bringing them back; if we go to war with China, we should especially be mindful of capturing their working population, with women and children being particularly desirable, to populate our island territories. If they come to redeem them, demand Ryals for those who have been lost, but women should not be allowed to be redeemed or leave the company's jurisdiction."</p>
<p>From this view, we can see that some Chinese in Southeast Asia and other places went there in response to others' urgent need for increased labor and population. Here we can say: the developed countries of Europe and America colonized the world for aggression, while a portion of China's overseas Chinese went to various parts of the world to meet the needs of their aggression; they were the bosses, we were the workers, the shop assistants.</p>
<p>It is true that many of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia were there before the Europeans and Americans arrived, and they made great achievements in developing the resources of those places. Former Governor of the Straits Settlements, Frank Swettenbam, once said, "Overseas Chinese developed the undeveloped resources of the Malay Peninsula"; and also said: "Before the arrival of white people in the Malay Peninsula, the Chinese were already mining, fishing, doing business, and farming there. After the arrival of white people, in the initial stages, they relied entirely on the financial resources of the Chinese to build roads and construct large-scale projects. All administrative expenses came from this. The Chinese were the first to explore various mines, and this is still the case today. They mostly cut down mountains and trees, and went deep into the wilderness, risking danger to protect great profits, but many died from the humid heat. They can also be metallurgists, woodcutters, and builders. All public offices, bridges, and railways are built by them. They can also invest huge amounts of money in this island, which Europeans dare not do. They are also good at doing business, establishing shipping companies to connect various ports in Malaya. They can also recruit workers to come and develop natural resources. The government taxes them, accounting for one-tenth of the revenue. For every successful project, one should know where the success lies; those who read this article should know what the Chinese have contributed to the various countries of Malaya." From this, we can see the history and status of overseas Chinese in the Malay Peninsula.</p>
<p>However, even for those overseas Chinese who arrived in Southeast Asia before the white people, although they made great contributions to the development of Southeast Asia, their status declined day by day after the white people's power invaded; and they were only a very small part of the overseas Chinese. The vast majority of overseas Chinese around the world still left under the needs of the development of European and American capitalism, and under the needs of their economic aggression.</p>
<p>However, because China has a vast territory and a large population, the number of overseas Chinese in various parts of the world is also very large. In addition, because the Chinese are hardworking, enduring, and good at saving, the wealth that overseas Chinese in various parts of the world earn each year, and the money they remit back to their home country each year, is also not a small amount. Our country has an excess of imports, with several million in cash flowing out each year, but the cash sent back from overseas by our overseas Chinese each year also amounts to tens of millions, which can indeed fill some of the import surplus and adjust the country. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of overseas Chinese in various parts of the world is not only related to the overseas Chinese themselves, but also to the country's economy.</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation of overseas Chinese, let us practically examine everything about overseas Chinese in various parts of the world.</p>

<h3>Quick Sketches of "Goddess of Liberty" Location Shooting</h3>
<p>The car drove with a hum to the Bund Pier. Sheltered by the tall buildings, the breeze from the Huangpu River was indeed much more comfortable than the sweltering studio.</p>
<p>Arriving at the pier, looking at the steamers and giant ships in the river, and the varying water waves, some people went to rest in the shade of the buildings to cool off, or ate a couple of open-air shaved ice.</p>
<p>Yang Jimin and Zhang Yunqiao went with director Situ Huimin to check the background. The light was very good, and there was not a cloud in the sky. When Bobo Dong put on his coat and hat and walked towards the ship, some of the spectators were very surprised: "Why is he wearing a coat in this hot weather?" Later, hearing the children shouting "Watch the filming, watch the filming," everyone seemed to understand.</p>
<p>There were not many shots, only three in total, and then they came back.</p>
<h3>A Beautiful Little Butterfly</h3>
<p>The youngest sister of the Liang sisters, Saihu, can sing and dance, and is lively and lovely. In the past, she constantly performed voluntarily in various group charity entertainment events.</p>
<p>This time, she plays the main role in Lianhua's new film "Four Sisters", and it is her first time appearing on the screen. The screenwriter and director Yang Xiaoshen, because she has excellent singing and dancing skills, made her play a singer in a song and dance troupe. Naturally, she is happy to be competent.</p>
<p>That day, the scene of the song and dance troupe's performance was filmed. The stage for this performance was a real scene of the Carlton Grand Theater. This time, the temporary actors who played the customers filled the stage. On the stage, they sang, danced, and the music followed. It was truly wonderful singing and dancing, to the extreme.</p>
<p>That Saihu, after all, is extraordinary. She jumps on the stage like a beautiful little butterfly.</p>
