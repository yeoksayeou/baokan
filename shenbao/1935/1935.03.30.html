<p>— 冷觀</p>
<p>自去年秋季以來。金融驟緊百業銷沈。都會亦隨農村之後。立呈蕭索氣象。當局為救濟金融計。一面與英美等國磋商借欵一千萬鎊。一面復發行金融公債一萬萬元。擴充銀行資本雙管齊下。期收流通經濟扶植工商業之實效。現在公債條例已經立法院通過。日內卽將發行一千萬鎊之借欵。雖尙在磋商之中。未敢必其成否。然據外國報紙所傳。國際協力以救我國金融。似有實現之可能性。借欵倘能成功。對於我國經濟果有若何影響耶。</p>
<p>當增徵白銀出口稅令初頒之際。一般不明眞相者妄加揣測。以為通貨膨脹之說或不免實現。以致資本紛紛逃避。白銀依然外溢。後經當局一再聲明决不出此。而進行借欵之消息。同時亦喧騰於中外報紙。於是疑慮頓釋。人心漸定蓋借欵計畫。與通貨膨脹政策相反。欲行通貨膨脹固不必有賴於借欵。欲進行借欵。卽為不採通貨膨脹之明證。此人心所以頓形安定也。人心安定資本不復逃避。白銀外溢之勢亦可暫時抑止。</p>
<p>我國對外貿易向屬入超。以前幸有巨額華僑匯欵。及外資流入藉資抵補。近年匯欵驟减。投資亦少。國際收入不敷支出。於是生金生銀源源輸出。有不易挽回之勢。雖自不景氣發生以來。社會經濟枯滯。購買力銳减洋貨不若囊年之暢銷。然輸出衰落不振。依然失其平衡。國內存金實無巨額。白銀須充凖備。安可任其繼續外流。旣難輸出金銀以資抵補。自非有賴於海外之信用不可。當局為杜絕白銀外流起見。竭力進行借欵。似尙不失為救濟金融緊縮之一策。</p>
<p>借欵果能成立。金融藉以稍舒。卽財政亦可稍資抱注。急則治標此舉固未可厚非。倘能標本兼籌以借欵所得。購置建設材料。注重於墾闢農田。振興水利。俾國內農產大增。食糧進口减少。一面設法節制不必要之消費。以杜奢侈品之輸入。一面實行廢除轉口稅减免出口稅。以獎勵國貨輸出。貿易入超之勢。或可挽回。存積國內之金銀。旣能保持不失。金融緊縮之患。庶幾可免乎。</p>

<p>英國政策於二月三日與法簽定協定之時、已向恊同保全和平之道前進一步、正唯如此、蘇聯政府對於倫敦恊定乃備加歡迎、且以充分合作自矢、蘇英兩國一處於歐洲之極東、一處於歐洲之極西、且均與他洲相述、故予以為英蘇合作、對於和平實有决定之重要、而閣下之行、不唯為此合作之肇始、且為其長此繼續之保證、歐洲政治家必能洞悉、歐洲任何部份和平之破壞、將有極惡之結果、同時彼等自知身負重大責任、在此後數月或數星期內、吾人將見彼等究能以目前國際情勢所迫切要求之途徑、組織和平、並實行二月三日倫救所定合作計劃、以獲取其賢明的邏輯的結論否也、唯無論如何、艾君興予及予之同事間之坦白交換意見、對此工作必能大有買獻」云、</p>
<p>艾登氏致答詞</p>
<p>旋由艾登致答辭、首對李氏殷勤歡迎致謝、並謂彼對李氏所稱此行在英蘇邦交發展上開一新階段云云、至為意、此行雖純屬探訪性質、絕無談判義、「唯吾人得曰、此番初次懇談、在吾兩國邦交中、洵為顯著而有希望（予信其如此）之界石」云、艾登追述國聯邀請蘇聯入盟事、申述英政府外交政策乃以國聯為根據、復力稱蘇聯加入國聯之重要、艾氏且謂和平與改善國交為國聯之主要目的、同時和平復為英國外交政策之首要目標、「予信此點於各國主要目的在謀國民欣欣向慰之祭亦必為蘇聯及其他國家方面之憂慮、予堅信此種局面、必待世界各大國之代表促膝談話坦白交換意見、乃能改進、此種信念、自予最近訪問各處後、並未減弱、此行首要之點亦卽在此、日後斯特里薩各國外長會議、以及今日吾人之會談、其目的要在找求脫離目前歐洲困境之途徑、此等途徑對於各國須為正直而可敬、同時與吾人深信之合作安全之原則相符合、吾人其他問題雖有出入、唯上述云云、乃係吾人共同之立塲、予願同時深信吾人必能堅定前進、以保持和平」云、散席後、卽有盛大之招待會、赴會者有外交團蘇聯公共機關代表及國內外記者、（廿九日塔斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）西門外相今日在下院報吿英德談話經過情形、默認英德交涉毫無進步、西門承認德國元首希特勒態度强硬、以致談話結果、已「發覺意見大相懸殊」、惟外相尙未表示絕望、並稱、談話結果已蹬明頗有價値、且雙方皆能暸解對方之見地云、西門亦愼重聲明此行不過為英國向歐洲各國徵詢意見之第一次談話、最後將由英法意三國代表在斯德萊薩舉行會議、故在目前猶未能將一般局勢詳細說明、至柏林談話之範圍、則包括一切歐洲問題、及德國對於此種問題之關係云、美聯社復自半官方面得悉、希特勒至少曾要求收回屬地一處、及正式廢止凡爾賽和約之軍事條欵、以為德國重返國聯之交換條件云、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>英將何所適從</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國西門外相昨日在下議院表宣言、承認英德兩國見解所距甚遠、此間各報加以評論、皆謂倫敦每日電聞報所揭露之希特勒五項要求、雖經德國政府加以否認、究屬實在情形、此可於西門外相演詞證之、「小巴黎人」報謂、「德國所發表之否認文、其內容僅涉及五項要求中之兩項、卽（一）波蘭走廊歸還德國、（二）捷克境內德國少數民族所聚居之地、亦當歸還德國、此種否認旣不完全、而又遲至昨日始乃發表、實難使世界輿論加以信任、似此德國所提要求、範圍之廣、實已無可置疑、西門外一相對於英德兩國意見參差之處、並不諱一言、特為遵守外交禮儀起見、故意含蓄其詞、但英德談話第一日所發生之消極印象、固已證明無訛矣」、「巴黎迴聲」報謂、「德國發出否認文、固屬易事、但其內容若較為明晰、對於希特勒所言與其所諱言者若較為詳盡、則世人自較易相信」、「事業報」謂、英國現有兩種態度可以採取、其一縱任德國為所欲為、其二積極組織安全制度、以對付德國霸權、凡此西門外相均已明言之矣」云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>國會各派態度</p>
<p>（倫敦）本日外相西門在下院坦白陳述、謂英德兩國觀點大相懸殊、國會方面人士聞之、頗有良好印象、蓋近日若干報紙所載德國提出之條件、大體係屬事實、國會方面人士固巳知之甚審、就此等報紙所載、德國重返國聯會之條件、其內容殊足令人昨舌、保守黨方面認為此種條件、絕對不能接受、因此僅希望斯德萊薩會議中各國保持密切聯繫、以共同保障集體安全、將來如德國變更其要求、則當再令其加入各項集體安全公約、保守黨尤贊成在西歐方面訂結互助條約、蓋以西歐一旦有事、英國因其所處地理位置、必不免牽入漩渦也、此外其他各項互助公約、則可由英國政府以純粹外交途徑加以贊助、而不直接參加、保守黨意見大抵如此、至於自由黨及工黨對於德國所提要求之過於廣泛、未免大感失望、蓋自由黨與工黨之反對派、本思以談話失敗之責任諉諸政府、藉此詰難政府、今德國要求條件旣如此苛酷、轉使反對派無法非難政府、若干工黨議員表示希特勒之要求條件、乃係最大限度之要求、將來與法國談判後、必可大見削减云、總之、自由黨與工黨之態度、一大部份將俟斯德萊柴會議後、西門提出報吿時、方可確定、倘西門報吿瞪明德國之强硬態度、無可挽回、則自由黨與工黨之地位、自將削弱、蓋因無所藉口以向政府施行攻擊也、（二十八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）比國幣價跌後、擁護法佛郞金本位者迄未變其態度、但商界中人則漸主張抑低幣値、法國關稅屛障可使匯價變化失其效力、故比佛郞雖貶價、法佛郞仍可不受經濟上反動、惟銀行家恐人民為利所動、售出法國公債、而將其閒擱資金投諸外國證券之中、果爾、則將提取銀行之欵、而釀成紙幣膨脹、蓋銀行對於存戶之債務、大都未有充分保障也、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）比國交易所之停市、為比幣貶値之先聲者、並未擾亂紐約金融巿塲、蓋比國此種發展並非完全出人意外也、惟比幣貶値後、其他金幣將威受何種影響乎、此層頗為人所猜測、若干方面以為用金團如果崩潰、則各方面貨幣迅速安定之途徑反因之而打開、當與全世界有益、有人對於外傳巴黎運金至紐約之辦法、認為金幣趣劇之最後一幕、但巴黎確否有金運美、將視比國最後發展為轉移、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國匯兌管理處已以價値一千八百萬鎊之黃金由倫敦運往巴黎、以抵付在英鎊匯價合七十一佛郞時購進遠期英鎊之價、因英當局未有充分佛郞也、此次黃金之裝運與其他黃金流動、毫無關係、巴黎因商界需用美元、隨時局緊張而增多、故黃金現陸續流入紐約、法國金融局勢現繫於荷蘭與瑞士能否繼續裝出黃金以應付外國資金之撤回、如此二國减少或停止黃金之運出、則法當局不得已將設法遏止黃金之流出、據一般意見、歐陸新近之政治發展、或使法當局更不願喪失大批黃金也、傳說比相齊倫將提議抑低比幣價値使與英鎊成二十六比佛郞合英金一鎊之比例、換言之、卽比佛郞减値百分之二十八是也、衆料比國將在倫敦發行四釐比國公債以便掉換比國國內公債、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>希魯塞爾　比內閣在國會宣佈准國家銀行暫停付出黃金、並聲稱將組織一特殊機關、監督內閣所定之信用政策與匯率、此種臨時辦法、將從二月三十一日實施有效、比國暫時脫離金本位但政府仍有將來恢復金本位之意云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日比相齊倫請求國會授權（一）削抵比幣價値、以百分三十為限、（二）在國際協定通貨政策以前、暫行限制支付、比相提議先將幣値减低百分之二十五、此為用金團之第一次破裂、比幣貶値、將影饗比國對英之某種輸出貨、比國向來輸出大批鋼鐵、惟自英鎊價跌後、此物輸入英國、為數大减、比國並製造大批水泥磚、今後因比幣價格之低落、將在英國境內及海外與英國相競爭、（廿九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦聞比國抑低幣値之决議後並未震動、惟竚待其他用金國有何反動之消息、此間金融界謂比內閣所採之途徑、與羅總統前所採用者同出一轍、比相齊倫效法羅總統、請求國會准許其有權最高度之減値、而不以最後减數自行拘束、此席乃欲保留有力工具、以便將來在安定幣價之國際談判中從事折衝、齊倫素來崇拜羅總統、自信渠可步羅之後塵利用因重行估定金準備價値而得之紙上盈餘、以充平準經費、歐陸需求英鎊、近日頗股、今日比國之舉動使英鎊需求更為暢旺、但倫敦證券交易所並未受何影響、巴黎人士指比國此舉、為由黃金團至英鎊團之輸血行為、現正注視比國國內物價將否如法國提倡减低幣値者所發之理論能始終穩定、如其物價穩定與此理論相合、則預料法國境內要求削低幣値之呼聲、將視今更高、（廿九日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c79">一九三四年　蘇俄的對外貿易　（德國通訊） <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>自從第二次五年計劃着手施行以來、蘇俄國內實業的發展、巳經成為舉世所驚奇的事伴、特別是在一九三四年對外貿易的數字上、更充分表現蘇俄不斷地突進、已漸次有變成一個「自供自給」國度的可能、月前斯太林會說過、由於五年計劃的結果、蘇俄已由一個木材國家變成了鋼鐵國家、這倒幷不算誇張、因為蘇俄目前已大有苦盡甘來的形勢、</p>
<p>要是在數年前、偶然提到五年計劃、歐洲各報無不用一種嘲笑的態度來叙述、譏為「奇談」、可是年來這種空氣漸漸消滅、而變為嚴密的注視、卽如兩年來的德報、因為民族社會主義與共產主義根本上的衝突、就極少有登載關於蘇俄現狀的文章、但是最近却也改換方向、討論蘇俄的文字、已常散見於各報上、可見年來蘇俄的進步、無論為敵為友、都不能不深切地加以注意的、</p>
<p>一九三四年一月起至十月止、十個月中蘇俄對外的貿易總數、共計五萬三千三百六十萬盧布、同樣的、在一九三三年十個月中、總數為七萬零一百五十萬盧布、一九三二年十個月中、總數甚至於達十萬五千八百六十萬盧布、照這個數字看來、從一九三二年至一九三四年、兩年間蘇俄對外的全部貿易、幾乎銳減了一半、假如在資本主義國度、那自然是受了世界經濟恐慌影響的結果、而是一種衰落的現象、但蘇俄是個社會主義的國家、對外貿易的目的、是在於求本國實業發展的成分多、與資本主義的國家根本上有些不同、所以這個傾向、也可證明蘇俄本國實業的根基逐漸穩固、而對於外國貨物需要、可以漸次减省、</p>
<p>値得注意的、蘇俄對外貿易的銳减、是特別在於輸入方面、一九三四年十個月中、輸入總數只一萬八千九百八十萬盧布、在一九三三年為二萬九千一百二十萬盧布、一九三二年甚至於達五萬九千七百一十萬盧布、這就是說在兩年間、蘇俄輸入的總額、幾乎减少了三分之二、同樣的、顯然證明兩年來蘇俄本國的工業產品、已大部分代替了外國貨物、至於輸出部分、在一九三四年十個月中、總額為三萬四千三百八十萬盧布、在一九三三年為四萬一千零二十萬盧布、一九三二年為四萬六千一百四十萬盧布、蘇俄的輸出總數、兩年來雖然减少了一萬一千七百六十萬盧布、但與輸入總數低减的比率一比較、就會覺得為數尙微、另一方面、在一九三四年中關於銀及其他貴重金屬的輸出、並未列入統計表內、照一九三三年的統計、在輸出項下、銀類等佔三千二百五十萬盧布、所以全盤說來、蘇俄在一九三四年間的輸出總額、事實上低减得並不多、</p>
<p>蘇俄在對外貿易上、兩年來巳變成一個出超的國家、一九三四年出超數目為一萬五千四百萬盧布、一九三三年出超數目為一萬一千九百萬盧布、相反的在一九三二年時期、蘇俄的入超尙佔一萬三千五百七十萬盧布的數目、由於最近兩年間的出超、並年來蘇俄國內產金大量的增加、於是對於因五年計劃所負下的外國債不獨能够按期償還、而且盧布在國際市塲上的價格也一天天在高漲、至此蘇俄對外貿易的難題、遂完全解决、目前蘇俄對於在他國訂購貨物時、已提出關於付欵條件要比歷來更加優惠的要求了、</p>
<p>蘇俄的輸出品、在一九三四年間、大體上雖然沒有多大的變更、可是在意義上、却與從前已大有分別、例如在輸出的貨物中、已新加入一部分全製工業品、雖說數目並不大、一九三四年十個月中、機器類的輸出總數（農業耕種機除外）計一百四十萬盧布、鋼鐵計一百三十萬盧布、鋼鐵類的製造品二百六十萬盧布、人工肥料計四百八十萬盧布、這個數目固然不多、但也足證明蘇俄已漸由農業國家變成工業國家、自然、蘇俄在一九三四年十個月中最主要的輸出品、仍是木材、總數計達八千一百六十七萬盧布、比較在一九三三年同時期的輸出額、約增加了一千三百萬盧布、其次為煤汕、總數計四千八百廿萬盧布、較之一九三三年同時期中、減少了一千六百餘萬盧布、再次為烟草類總數、為二千八百九十六萬盧布、較一九三三年約减少了八百萬盧布、此外、穀類總數為一千八百廿八萬盧布、較一九三三年减少了一千四百餘萬盧布、棉花總數為一千八百八十二萬盧布、較一九三三年約减少了七百五十萬盧布、亞麻類總數計一千六百零二萬盧布、較一九三三年約增加了一百五十萬盧布、麵粉總數計五百一十萬盧布、較一九三三年約增加了兩百萬盧布、乳酪等總數計七百九十萬盧布、較一九三三年約减少了兩百萬盧布、這是蘇俄輸出貨物的大槪、</p>
<p>關於蘇俄的輸入部門、正如上面所述、就較之一九三三年也約减低了百分之三十六、這原因自然因為蘇俄在第二次五年計劃施行的初期、不能不大批購入外國的工業機器、於是輸入的總願就格外多、到了一九三四年、一面為的國內工業漸次發展、本國所產的機器已足適應國內一部分的要求、另一面世界經濟恐慌的深刻依然存在、對外輸出無法盡量發展、於是只有在輸入部門內加以限制、以穩定俄幣在世界巿塲上的市價、這種含有伸縮性的對外貿易制度、就給予蘇俄的經濟一個重要的保障、在一九三四年十個月中從外國輸入的機器、（農業耕種機除外）總數計三千三百二十七萬盧布、而在一九三三年同時期為一萬零八十九萬盧布、一九三二年甚至於達二萬四千零一十四萬盧布、電器用品的輸入總數為七百一十六萬盧布、一九三三年為一千七百七十七萬盧布、一九三二年甚至於達五千八百零九萬盧布、鋼鐵類的總數為二千三百七十八萬盧布、在一九三三年尚為四千零八十萬盧布、其他金屬總數為一千八百六十二萬盧布、在一九川三年為一千八百三十九萬盧布、銅鐵類的製造品總數為一千三百九十八萬盧布、此外尙有茶的輸入額計五百九十萬盧布、牲畜為八百六十萬盧布、烟草為五百七十萬盧布、羊毛為九百一十萬盧布等等、</p>
<p>至於蘇俄與各國間的貿易、以國別來論、在輸入方面一九三四年間英國佔第一位、計三千六百二十萬盧布、在一九三三年同時期中、英國對蘇俄的輸出却只有九百三十萬盧布、其次為德國、計二千五百四十萬盧布、在一九三三年德國對蘇我的輸出、計達一萬一千四百萬盧布、而一九三四年間貿易額的突减、自然是出於政治上的原因、再次為美國、美國於美俄復交以後、關於商業方面本存極大的奢望、可是結果却並不能如預期的一樣、一九三四年間、美國對蘇俄的輸出額計一千六百一十萬盧布、較之在一九三三年未恢復國交以前同時期中、只多增加一百萬盧布、而蘇俄對美的輸出、在一九三四年却只一千零八十萬盧布、較之在一九三三年反低减了一百三十萬盧布、這個商務上的結果、就產生了近來美俄間的債務談判中止、而在兩國却交上也有漸趨惡劣的傾向、原來美俄的復交、固然大部分出於政治上的動機、但美人重利、把經濟上的利益似乎看得格外重要、我們一看到美俄兩國在一九三四年間的貿易數字、也就不難明白兩國間近來外交關係的變化了、</p>
<p>總之由於蘇俄一九一四年間的對外貿易看來、一面表示國內建設的工作漸達到了康莊大道、不久的將來、就有趕上歐美各先進工業國家的可能、另一方面正因為由此、使蘇俄與其他資本主義國家間的衝突、更加尖銳化、加緊各國聯合進攻蘇俄的企圖、歐洲各國此日備戰甚急、幾年以內、戰禍幾乎隨時都有爆發的可能、而對俄問題、更是其中最重要的導火綫之一、（二月二十八日於德國）</p>
<h3 id="c80">戰幕中活動的日本 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— （日本通信）</p>
<p>復古運動得勢立憲政治衰微</p>
<p>善隣外交的高調、對美親善、對蘇友好、對華提携等等、都唱得很響、新近中東路又收買成功了、照這樣情形看來、日本的國際外交政策、似乎是和平的傾向多、太平洋眞可以太平了、廣田弘毅外相的「道義外交」、該是名不虛傳罷、然而同時我們又看見日本全國各地備戰的積極、各官辦軍需工廠日夜加工、各民間廠家、凡與軍需關係比較密切的也莫不市利十倍、尤其是二月以來、各大新聞都各邀集陸海軍中凡參加過日俄戰役的將領、開紀念座談會、侈談戰爭當時的情况、敷陳戰蹟、鼓勵一般人民的戰鬬精神、</p>
<p>戰爭的史蹟與和平外交並列着、也和小石川砲兵工廠與東京帝國大學相呼應、是差不多的、東京帝國大學在那裏造人材、講學問道德、小石川砲兵工廠却連日連夜不斷的製造殺人的工具、而且要那些槍砲越精越好、意思是要殺得人越多、越合乎他們原來的目的、日本整個政治的表現、也是如此、明治維新到現在五十多年、日本是一個立憲政治的國家、學校裏通行了幾十年的憲法學說、過去從不曾發生問題的憲法學說、不意今年六十七議會竟引起很大的波瀾、陸海軍雙方對此也表示抗議、而議會政治的法治精神、却顯然頹落下去、</p>
<p>日本議會政治的衰頹、自然也受世界政治關係的影響、同時旣成各政黨又有多少不可掩飾的弱點、例如歷次大受賄案都牽聯政黨中要角、但還算不得最重要的原因、而軼出立憲常軌的是非常時期、—九·一八事變後、尤其是五·一五案件、犬養被刺以後、—操縱非常時期的主舵是軍部、非常時期的調子愈高、軍部的權力愈大、政黨簡直要沒有活動的餘地、一切得聽軍部的指導、軍部是主張以天皇為中心的、與議會取决於多數的民主思想根本不同、何况離開羣衆很遠的旣成政黨、空負民主的虛名、得不到羣衆的擁護、其沒落自在意中、</p>
<p>日本這個國家中層社會很有力量、其組織力相當强靭、他們的信仰很堅實、知識能力又經過相當的訓練、他們現在是構成日本社會的重心、這一般人不滿意於上層的腐化、不滿於政治現狀、特別對財政資本不滿、所以他們擁護軍部的政策、贊成軍部的一切、旣成政黨就失去羣衆的憑藉、而徒有虛名了、</p>
<p>「和平」是武裝的一件外套、是軍部借用國際外交的一種手段、同時也就是議會政治與官僚合作的把戲、我們且以三月十日軍事參議官阿部信行視察「滿洲」為例、以證明日本實際政治的動向、本來阿部一個人去看看東三省、去慰勞在「滿」的部隊、並沒有什麽稀罕、其値得注意的是、阿部四月間回日本以後、接着是荒木貞夫去、（我們都曉得這位荒木大將是非常時期中的主腦人物、是少壯軍人的領袖、）他去視察「滿洲」、决不是普通的遊歷性質、必含有重大的軍事政治意味、據說他還要到華北去看看、到五月間、現任陸軍大臣林銑十郞步阿部荒木的後塵往東四省去、也說是視察、是慰勞在「滿」部隊、以現任陸相出外國去視察、在日本是很少見的、並且還要赴華北等地、更具有特殊的意味、日本的軍事戰略家渡邊錠太郞大將、（現任軍事參議官）在陸相林銑十郞回國後要到東北四省去、最後去的人是松井石根大將、（陸軍中的支那通）表面都說是視察、是慰勞部隊、凡是陸軍中的軍事參議官都要到「滿洲」去走一遍、所負的使命大槪相同、內含的意義、一樣重大、當此立憲政治衰頹、軍力飛躍的時期、和平恐怕是擺在軍刀底下吧、（三月二十三日於東京）</p>

<p>尙有一建議、為若干方面所創者、即採用英鎊以為本位之新幣、以代現有通貨是也、白銀仍為中國滙兌中最適宜媒介物、而吾人所遇之困難、大都為局部的、而非普及的、故吾人不宜考慮放棄銀本位、此層余前巳言之、</p>
<p>美國所患者、為通貨與信用二者之過多、而上海所患者、則為通貨與信用二者之過少、用膨脹方法、僅以擴大通貨、則勢必貽害、但若能以穩健方法、獲取通貨之擴大、則立即發生之裨益、應甚可觀也、</p>
<p>余因是建議、有可値得考慮者、英鎊借欵、倘能覓得、可否以上述旨趣利用之、充一種輔幣或代替幣之準備、而不施於安定或統制滙兌之可疑的用途、至於此種借欵之担保問題、當然尙待討論、但余所欲言者、為較小債欵產生多大實惠之可能性、</p>
<p>數額幾何、極關重要、余不欲估計之、余所建議者、中國如能獲有相當數字之英鎊借欵、可有益的、且亦安全的發行一種鈔票、以英鎊為抵、而與現有銀幣、共同流通於市、</p>
<p>觀之、此舉似未有特殊利益、而上海亦未必對於此種鎊券、有多大需求、但若吾人稍稍考慮之、則此鎊券、在日常商業中、顯可有種種用途、吾人試首言輸入問題、目前輸入商、如不能在其輸人品未曾脫手以前、設法仍以外幣保持其貨本、則須於輸入時、冒滙兌之危險、常有櫃兌上損失之虞、若不願損失、則貨物在手莫可售脫不然、則須越出商人眞正業務之範圍、而套進滙票、藉以保護自己、預防滙率高漲、但此舉亦可使競爭家以較低售價奪其交易也、</p>
<p>如輸出商不獨能關於其貨物之外幣成本、不結滙價、且能以同樣外幣、售出其貨、則不冒滙兌上之危險、而可時常確知其可得之利潤究有幾何、</p>
<p>上述辦法、凡輸入商向用英鎊國採辦貨物者可適用之、而免去套進滙票之必要、不過向他國辦貨之進口商、則仍須套買匯票耳、</p>
<p>上海在櫃檯上以英鎊購物之主張、驟視之、似乎離奇、但實按之、則固許多舶來品買賣中現所常有事也、零售店隨時按照滙率、變更其物價、在買主方面、實際上已以外幣購物、如貨物以英鎊出售、而購者以鎊券付價、如是則購者可無需必用銀元矣、</p>
<p>上海人民、不妨購置　券、或在銀行開英鎊信用賬、無論購買一瓶威士忌酒、一本外國小說、一雙外來皮鞋、或一罐烟草、皆可一律使用之、物價當然受來源之變更、銷費人以英鎊償付之代價、當不致時有變遷、</p>
<p>今假定舶來品可以英鎊定價、而償付之、則進口商不妨以此新幣付其關稅、此亦新幣最大用途之一、關金與本地通用銀元間之匯價、逐日規定、則鎊劵與銀元間折合價格、亦可照此辦法而規定之、就事實言、照目前銀價、余未見關金不應廢除、而代以英鎊之理由、</p>
<p>財部亦不較前無所不利、蓋關稅收入之英鎊、仍可利用以償付外債及海外用途、並不稍感困難、至於純粹的國內需要、如淸償國內公債等、則其情勢與今日徵收關金時無稍差異、出。稅儘可仍用白銀徵收也、</p>
<p>吾人荀考慮在滬所購之貨物、與所享之服務、其來自國外者佔多大成分、則將見此新幣之用途、並不專以買賣舶來品為限、試以旅館言、其所有一大部份費用歸於海外、其所置地毯帘幕刀文等物、須隨時更換、其所備之酒類、須來自外洋、其所佩職員、有須以外幣給　者、而旅館所有之收入、出自來滬旅行家之　中者、亦復不少、旅客苟能免除當地匯兌之困難、固其所願、如一旅館在此新制度不能以上海鎊券付其所輸入者、並規定其價格、則將以大部份賬欵折合英鎊為得計、如是、則銀元之需求、又可稍鬆動矣、在實施上、或有供給若干較小的代表幣制之必要、此項代用幣、不妨由市政局設法備置之、如歐戰時巴黎市發行輔助幣以便零掉然、</p>
<p>上海不乏薪給階級、彼等以英鎊支其全薪、或其一部、彼等固甚願以此新幣領其薪俸、而免折合之勞、</p>
<p>請假返國者、可携此鎊券而行、此幣終將成國際流通券之一種、如五鎊鈔票與一鎊鈔票然、</p>
<p>余非謂此種新券、應為中國永遠通貨之一種、亦非謂可適用於上海以外之中國他處、不過此券終將在外埠有若干流通耳、余之建議、僅以試騐性質提出之、以作擴大通貨而不膨脹通貨之可能的方法、藉以渡過吾人現所遭遇之艱苦時期、事有無待想像而可知者、此幣為窖藏起見、當較尋常通用貨幣更為人所歡迎、如果如是、亦復與衆有益、因可騰出更多銀元、以流通於巿、而此銀元、固始終必須為中國主要之貨幣也、</p>
<p>關於實施此種計畫之機關、余請略述其辦法、不過余承認余對於此事之意見、在目前階段下頗為流動、而不堅决也、</p>
<p>今似可組織一委員會辦理發行鎊券事、而組成此委員會者、當為財部與中外銀行之代表、</p>
<p>所借得之英鎊借欵、交與此委員會支配之、委員會於是乃可出售鎊券、其數等於債額</p>
<p>此幣在若干時日後、或將流回倫敦、而取現欵無論如何、旣收入債欵、自當注意付欵、是時此委員會當巳收有出售此種鎊券之現資矣、</p>
<p>此種鎊券、不可聽共投機、故收入之銀元、必須以遠期套出之、以資保護、同時此項銀元、可借與銀行、有一定之期限、庶可鬆動銀根、</p>
<p>如付欵購此鎊券者、繼續增多、超過所有之債額、則此委員會須將所收之欵現資匯出、庶減輕他方面之透支、余可無庸為銀行家言者、照余所言之計畫、當可獲有相當之盈餘、以抵付印刷等費用、並可在總給時獲浄利、</p>
<p>總括言之、若此鎊券、可自由流通、則此計畫、第一可增多通貨、第二可擴大信用、因旣有鎊幣、則以上海資產為抵之英鎊借欵、當可自由使用、而銀行定準備放出英鎊之透支、</p>
<p>余之建議、欲避免干涉中國現有之通貨、不獨無所妨害、且可有所裨益、余想一般人當共承認之也、俟美國白銀政策有變更時、或發生他種因素可助中國脫離其目前困難時、則此二重通貨、即可立時廢除、</p>
<p>最後、余覺照余所說之用途、欲覓取英鎊借欵、似可少感困難、不若以前向英國所提出之任何理由、備受困難也、（完）</p>

<p>— 胡洛</p>
<p>易卜生寫了「傀儡的家庭」，娜拉最後便喊「我立刻就要走了」。於是娜拉脫離了家庭，走到社會裹去了。自然，易卜生只能寫到這兒為北。他絕不能告訴我們，娜拉走到社會中又將怎樣，到社會中後，問題便很容易地解决了麼？易卜生是解决不了這問題的。</p>
<p>因為某敎授告訴我，說古典主義的作品大都沒有內容的。他特別指出莫利哀（Moliere）來，說莫利哀的作品也是內容空虛的，沒有思想的。我懷疑了，於是便找了本「厭世者」（Le　Misanthope）來讀。結果，我發覺敎授是欺騙了我。「厭世者」是內容的。（本來，內容與形式便是個分不開的統一物）從「厭世者」裹，我看見了一個男性的娜拉。他便是「厭世者」的主角「亞爾遂期特」。亞爾遂斯特是個厭世的人，他痛恨人間的虛偽，他痛恨那些戴着假面具的貴族。貴族們是那麼虛偽，形式而假歉虛。晉爾遂斯特便憤恨地說：「騙子，無恥之徒，混賬的强盜，人皆以為然，無一人加以否認。然而，他的醜態是到處受歡迎：大家招待他，大家笑臉相迎，無論何處都有他的份兒；縱是最能幹的人也爭不過他。」亞爾遂斯特苦悶了。因為他老實地批評了一個貴族的詩，說：「你的詩只好擲在厠所裹。」因此，那貴族便控告了他。他又發現他的情人是那麼虛假，淫邪；他的正直又招惹了別人的誣害。於是，他傷心了，他極端地，憎恨這世界了。最後，他决定脫離這罪惡的社會，到沙漠裹去。他在最末一幕裹說：「我是處處被欺騙，受着種種不公的壓迫。我就要跳出這惡習當道的　壑，遠遠去尋找一個可以自由作君子的僻壞。」</p>
<p>娜拉與亞爾遂斯特便有點相似：娜拉想脫離可憎恨的傀儡家庭，亞爾遂斯特是想脫離這可憎惡的社會。然而，易卜生與莫利哀一樣，都不能澈底解决娜拉與亞爾遂斯特的問題。</p>
<p>其實，「亞爾遂斯特便是莫利哀自身為代表的，被貴族的環境圍繞而又對之反抗着的」市民份子。莫利哀是有種偉大的精神，絕不像那敎授認為他是個諂媚貴族的作家。他「對貴族加以痛烈的攻擊，他以非常的大膽，嘲笑當時有力的人。」在公演「偽善者」（Tartuffe）時、便曾引起僧侶的憤怒，司祭，大僧正們都控訴他。拿破崙一世讀到他的作品時，便這樣說：「這戲曲倘若是在我的時代作的，那末我將不許其公演。」因此，莫利哀並不是個貴族的諂者，而是個貴族的叛逆者。從「厭世者」中，不是看出莫利哀是何等憎惡着貴族麼？然而，莫利哀與易卜生·托爾斯泰……一樣，都寫出了所有的社會矛盾，醜惡；然而，都不能給這「矛盾」以正確的解决。莫利哀懀惡着社會與貴族，但他又生活在這醜惡，污穢的氣氛中，這矛盾糾纏了他，於是他造出了一個理想的人物——亞爾遂斯特。莫利哀使亞爾遂斯特脫離這社會，走到沙漠中去孤寂地過他「君子人」的生活。自然，這是莫利哀的空想，也是他解决「矛盾」的方法。易卜生把娜拉弄出家庭，以為便解决了婦女問題；同樣，莫利哀把亞爾遂斯特脫離社會，也以為便解决了這醜惡的社會問題。</p>
<p>現在社會也是醜惡的，像亞爾遂斯特一樣，我們也感到矛盾、「悒鬱」。人，都是虛偽，醜惡地生活着。尤其是懸空生活的人，更感到深深的矛盾，更憎惡這社會。然而，亞爾遂斯特到底往那兒去呢？像莫利哀所寫的，往空想的路上走麼？然而，人是决不能脫社會而生存的！因此，亞爾遂斯特不能走向空想的路上，而應走到現實來！脫離他的「宮庭」，（舊巢）走到「生活」中來！</p>
<h3 id="c163">新加坡之夜 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>新加坡之夜，被攫在黑魔的手裹。</p>
<p>夜，在獅島的海濱被電燈光從高大雄偉的士敏土建築物上照射出來的，是煌煌然的資本國土的燦爛的外衣。在這的裹面，新加坡之夜却緊緊地被抱在魔鬼的手裹。都市腐爛面的內心，動蕩着，驚跳着，和糜爛着，等待有一天都市會給炸裂。</p>
<p>當日裹金錢的鏗鏘之聲被收入保險庫的時候，新加坡之夜被埋沒在金錢的餘溢里。黃昏時闊人們用着汽車兜風，夜裹萊佛士旅館的歐美投資者在燈紅酒綠裹跳着爵士的狂風，Capital戲院吞吐着鑒賞美國風的戀愛把戲的有閑富人；而街市上擠滿了遊人，冰和汽水在夜的都市上洋溢。</p>
<p>在大坡，太陽國土裹的帝國的女兒跪在綠燈下迎客，自皮的女子在秘密賣淫；在大世界和新世界，中國頭家們和少爺們在向賣肉的女人講價；這都市有的是流浪異國的可憐的娘兒們。</p>
<p>黑皮粗相的印度鬼在深夜里替富人們守夜，一張藤製的睡榻躺在華麗的店門前便像一只狗窠。在僻靜的街道的角落，黯淡的電燈光照着為來警察寂寞地站崗。失業之羣曾經躺在行人道上，慘淡的電燈光下照着的憔悴的形相看起來有如鬼影。</p>
<p>在熱哄哄地乘着凉的獅島海濱的人羣之中，光亮的夜月會照着異國的失意者的徘徊慘影。歐戰紀念碑旁，流浪的異國的少年會北望故國惆悵。在僻靜的海岸的角落，撲通一聲，雄壯的海潮會吞去懦弱的失敗者的一條生命。</p>
<p>當都市陷入深夜，沈寂吞噬了人海的狂潮的時候，富家人會抱着熱烈似火的南國的女兒酣臥，郊外的樹叢上却會掛上了失業者的屍身。或當霹　一聲，富家人驚醒了甜夢。一兩聲槍聲會刦去了人，搶去了財貨，待明朝新加坡的市場會熱哄哄如常，而統治者却會為「不景氣」帶來的災殃，絞盡了腦汁。</p>
<p>更可怕的是粉白的墻壁上貼上了宣傳的文章，電燈柱上塗滿了傳單和標語。失失業之羣在都市的夜做着無聲的狂吼，殖民地的子民預備個翻身的日子。被隔離着的中，巫人竟會聯結在一塊兒，而白種人之中也會出「國奸」。</p>
<p>儘管獅島海濱高倨着的建築物用着驕傲的姿態面向大海，都市的電燈照着往來奔馳的汽車。這新加坡之夜却孕育着未來的炸彈，包裹着罪惡，埋藏着新胎。</p>
<p>新加坡之夜是世界都市的夜，新加坡之夜在她的個性之外，却也有她的世界的普遍性。</p>
<p>夜，却是孕育着光明的明朝的。</p>
<h3 id="c164">二月的風 <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 張蘋</p>
<p>上紫花包裹，福生眼前彷彿　了一層迷糊的網，不敢再瞥一眼這古老的家，沉着頭逕　向官道上走去了。</p>
<p>高朗的天，沒有一片雲，二月的風柔和地拂着官道旁的柳樹，但是牠吹不散積壓在福生心頭的憂鬱。</p>
<p>記不起是什麼時候了，那簡直是一個夢：在他捨棄了的古老的家中，住着一對福生叫做爹媽的年老夫婦。那時候打發一個日子似乎拋棄沙粒一般容易，太陽沒有從山凹里吐出來的時候，田野里已滿佈了此唱彼和的山歌聲。他爹總是目送着他到田里去，再在門前迎接他歸來。老頭永遠吸着早烟袋，他覺得這世界已經超過了應該賜給於人類的。在晚餐的時候，他喜歡喝幾杯白乾，那皺紋的臉上就像晚霞一樣一株緋紅，於是講述起上代創業的經過來，他是不厭求詳的。但是他沒有講故事的口才，往往把鄰近團上來的孩子自動地散了開去。惟一的聽衆，是福生了；他對於這故事並不像他爹似的感到滿足，他有個藏在心的深處的希望，—那希望是從他一對鐵臂上建立起使爹驚奇的更大的事業來！</p>
<p>想到這里，一陣熱氣從他心底浮升起來，他想笑，但是他立即警悟了；那是個夢——像小時候哭醒回來的噩夢。</p>
<p>他竚立在橋頭，河心是他一個孤獨的影子。他叫做爹媽的人在一速串苦難的日子中離開了這世界。爹臨終時握着他的手說：「老天變了！你要努力！」就那樣地咽了氣。</p>
<p>這顫慄的聲音在他耳畔響起來的時候，福生返過頭來再盯一眼那個古老的家及一片被芟草發野着的田地——他一對壯健的手臂已經發酸了，二條腿也疲乏得再不能支持自己的體重；但是努力的結果呢？是肩頭的一個紫花包裹！</p>
<p>二月的風溫柔地拂着他垂到耳際的頭髪，他望了望前面停着航船的埠頭，一個新的希望又鼓湧着他向前走去。</p>
<p>——年底從牢獄里釋放出來，阿根熱情地邀到他家里，那情形就是他措起紫花包裹的時候一樣，阿根家里除了一塊不值錢的木板之外，只是四垜塌毀得不成模樣的牆壁了。</p>
<p>他握緊了福生的手，近乎與敵人肉搏般的有勁，他說：「我們的命運完了——整個的劉家莊完了！有我們這一對粗大的手，到外面去找黃金的世界吧！」</p>
<p>那聲音彷彿是一個響雷，把福生震得迷糊了過去；他從不知道自己的一對手能够打鐵鋤之外再有別的用處，他不信任阿根的話。」我要更努力，這田里再會結起燦爛的果實！」</p>
<p>他們就在埠頭分了手。</p>
<p>二月的風吹過了劉家莊，福生的農具完全吃到肚子里去了。田里已經沒有了歌聲，年粗的漢子一個一個少下去，整個劉家莊完了！」他才嘆了口氣，把財產收拾了一個紫花包裹。</p>
<p>行近埠頭，船家在太陽底下打呵欠，及至他瞧淸了是福生的時候，拍着他的肩頭說：</p>
<p>「相發財去？外面的野風大哩，你知道阿根嗎？」</p>
<p>那樣子挺像一只瘋狗一樣，船家在福生背上恨恨地挺了一拳：</p>
<p>「哼！做帮匪！把頭顱送給洋橄欖打靶！」</p>
<p>又頽然地倒下身去：</p>
<p>「我這條船呵！」船家哭了。</p>
<p>福生已失了知覺，他呆立在二月的春風中聽著布穀烏的「家家佈穀」從頭頂飛頭。</p>
<h3 id="c165">小巷風光 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 子岡</p>
<p>在這紫禁城的東犄角兒，有着個時常有壯健的漢子們在那裹打靶或操練的日本兵營，住在附近或走過的人常把它當個馬戲塲似的佇步凝睇，把一顆顆帶着三分恐怖的心按住。</p>
<p>這兵營的東面，是一條住着各種國籍的人們的小巷。</p>
<p>當然不會沒有它的主人——中國人，其餘的便數不淸了，日本人，美國人，英國人，法國人……</p>
<p>洋行的牌子觸目皆是，白白的粉牆上塗着洋字，有的是洋行門面在大街，職員宿舍在這裹。日本人的住宅牌子用小木牌掛在門側的多，其他國籍的則大都用一塊鐫了字的銅牌釘在門上。</p>
<p>瞧不見矗立雲霄的幾十層的摩天樓，除中國式的大宅門風味的房子外，只是些小巧玲瓏的兩三層的小洋樓，北平原不像上海那樣寸金地皮。</p>
<p>在這些屋子裹出現着挺胸凸肚的手提司的克的洋紳士們，一個個西服挺硬，速日本男人也全是穿着矮肥的西服，只有少數的日本女人才穿着和服在街上蹓躂，也要是感到方便和不使人注目，常有穿中國旗袍的，只在眉字間和髮角顯出她們的原籍。軒昂的白皮膚的女人們在門口穿出穿進，車夫們凑上去要買賣，當那兩隻穿着尖頭高跟皮鞋的脚才跨上車踏子上的時候，便撒腿飛奔，車夫們是非常歡迎着洋鬼子雇客，一方面是貪着一個比較豐的代價，（自然，皮靴的狠踢也是忘不了的。）一方面還高興佔個便宜，嘴裹嘟嚕幾句。</p>
<p>「洋娘兒們個個有子兒似的，誰都是一件反穿毛皮大衣！」自詡識見廣闊的便：</p>
<p>「你沒瞧見××胡同低頭求乞的女兒子哩！」</p>
<p>然而在這條小巷袋却似乎還沒有。倒是在高墻的空角處常有長不到六尺的小狹屋子，橫着一隻土坑，霉爛了的衣服和零物在白天橫堆着，這裹面住的是中國苦力們　甚至連苦力都不如，只是一些無職業無依靠的老年漢子們，他們從敝着的門口整天瞧着那些鬼子們來來往往；覺得自己就從沒有過靑春似的，輕輕唉嘆起來。這些小泥屋依峙在這些洋樓大厦之前眞是再好不過的對照。</p>
<p>包車和汽車在三分鐘裹的準會瞧見一輛，坐車的往往是白色種人或兒女一大羣的日本人，但拉車開車的却一定是華人。可就是，狹巷并未成為寬巷，土深五寸的街地並沒澆成光滑的柏油路。當夜晚汽車開近身前時，那雪亮的燈光會替你照見白天找不淸的凹凸痕跡，車過時，一層灰土飛漫得有半丈高，便挨到行路人的暗暗的咒罵。</p>
<p>這些門口時常站有司　的僕人，大多是乾乾凈凈，會幾句洋涇浜，街坊們遠遠地點着頭安閒地談一點瑣事，身前站的是短尾巴洋狗，洋狗似乎倒不分國籍，總是馴順地聽着黃臉僕人的呼喝。</p>
<p>梳得光眉光臉的中國女僕也出現在門口，手裹抱着的或是碧眼黃髪，或是穿着小和服的小孩兒們，女人嘴裏說着疆硬的外國話，孩子們，却往往隨機應變地，吐着簡短的中國詞句。</p>
<p>五六歲至七八歲的孩子們則不論中國外國，常會玩在一起，堆起一個砂堆，或在門前陳列一些玩具，畛域在孩子們之間是消毀了，黃色的手會攙住白色的手，黃毛的腦袋會伏在黑毛腦袋的肩上。眞摯的氣息在許多小嗓子眼兒裏發出來。</p>
<p>但人也曾見到過因了一個十四五歲的中國男孩騎車略略碰了一個外國孩子時，車前車後便立時追踪了十幾個相彷年齡的異國孩子，嘴裹喊着：</p>
<p>「打，打！」</p>
<p>是年齡的啓示麼？</p>
<p>再回頭看看那些昆連的外國兵營時，便覺得憤然了。</p>
<h3 id="c166">巨卿先生（二） <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>巨卿先生，六十多歲，上額放開，下頷尖削，而孔像一塊正確的三角板：等邊的。嘴唇上飄着幾根看起來不很瀟酒的灰白鬍子。兩隻眼睛向頰上深深地陷進去，像兩個窟窿。因為人太瘦小，灰色愛國布的羔皮袍子和黑絲絨馬褂顯得特別臃腫。那神態，那衣飾，都明明向白地告訴你這老人有着一部飽經風霜的歷史。</p>
<p>是的，凡是鎮上人誰不知道？巨卿先生是前清入第的秀才，有過功名的，全鎮上肚裏最深的塾師，衆望所歸，都承認是他。而且他又姓孔，家學淵源，據說還是孔夫子的嫡系後代。可是這一位聖門後裔，現在却正在為他教育事業的前途暗礁，担着深深的　鬱。</p>
<p>望着這開學第一天祭孔典禮中寥寥可數的八九個學生生想着當初弟子如雲的盛况，他是怎麼也禁不住感慨了。</p>
<p>巨卿先生在鎮上設　館，這一條「冷板凳一，少說點也坐了二十年了。</p>
<p>天天敎「子曰」，「詩云」，「趙錢孫李一，伴着常常掛滿了眼淚鼻涕的孩子，看着每頂書桌上一左一右鐘擺似地搖着的身體，耳朶裹塞滿了嗡嗡的書聲，銀硃筆，描紅字，書本，課本……這單調的日子是不容易過的，可見巨卿先生二十年的悠悠歲月，都在這中間消磨過去了。</p>
<p>敎書的生涯雖然淸高，但這好像祇是是　書人的一條末路。在當初，巨卿先生何嘗想到自已要承繼那種設帳課徒的聖門大業？</p>
<p>年靑時的巨卿先生，就跟當時一般埋頭窗下的書生一樣，繚繞在腦際的是富貴功名的美夢。因為本來家境不很好，世態炎凉親切地感得，想着裨史小說上許多坎河潦倒的落難公子，和自己的身世倒頗有許多地方吻合；於是期許着自己的也往往是「一枝杏花紅十里」那種光宗耀祖的前程。可是不幸這樣的美夢，終於隨着他憔悴的青春，在時代的劇變之後，粉碎了。</p>
<p>一大堆日子在不愉决的光景中度過。</p>

<h3 id="c203">低週率放大綫路之檢騐 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>修理收音機的人，一旦遇到了聲息毫無的收音機，他第一步要檢查的，當然是在决定牠的弊病，究竟發生在什麼地方。（整流，低放，中放，檢波或高放綫路內）通常最簡捷的試騐方法，是將手指輕敲各眞空管的栅極，（自最後一管起，依次前進。）細聽喇叭內有無卜篤卜篤，或「嗚鳴」之聲，如果手指觸在某一級眞空管的栅極上，而喇叭內並無聲饗，卽蹬明該級綫路或眞空管業已損壞。</p>
<p>上述的測騐法，雖很便利，可是普通收音機內地位狹小，零件衆多，手指往往不易伸進。卽使可以探入，却又很容易觸着其他的高壓綫路上，結果，時常會使你受到意外的打擊。（Shock）</p>
<p>利用低週率振盪器，（A．F．Oscillator）以測騐低週率放大線路這當然是最完善的方法。可是這類專門的儀器，價值昂貴，祇能讓給專門家去應用，我們以經濟為標榜的普通業餘家，是很難置備的。</p>
<p>新近在美國無綫電雜誌上看到一篇關於低週率放大綫的試騐法，是利用電燈上的交流音（A．C．hum）而完成的，確屬設想新穎，便於實用，特為翻譯如左，以供同好。</p>
<p>如圖，花綫一根，一端接在撲落上，一端串聯一能耐高壓之　0005MFD固定電容器後，再接在試騐針（Test　Prod）上。（試騐針之狀態，頗似普通活動鉛筆，上部為絕綠物所製，下部尖端，則為導體。見附圖左角虛線內所示。）使用時，先將撲落挿在電燈上，並開放收音機，次將試騐針觸在强力放大管的屏極及柵極上，（如圖虛綫1，2所示）如喇叭內有嗡嗡的交流聲，卽為末級低放綫路完好之表徵。如此依次接觸各眞空管的屏栅極，直至接觸時喇叭中不生交流音，卽能找出損壞低放級的所在。</p>
<h3 id="c204">初進同志應具之知識 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 楊學綸</p>
<p>在本刋中關於指導初裝收音機者之文字，已散見於各期中，似無再叙述之必要，但細讀以前所刋載者，大部份偏重於單管收音機之裝配法。現在所出眞空管之式樣與號數旣多，因此綫路圖亦多，卽偶或有眞空管選擇法之記載，又語焉不詳，使初學者讀之，如墮五里霧中，莫衷一是，所以借本刊一角，以告初學無綫電之同好者。</p>
<p>研究無綫電者，類皆從礦石機入手，經過相當時間後，輒覺效率太低，於是改裝為單管，而二管，逐步擴充。不過因缺乏相當知識，致使已購眞空管與零件之廢棄，綫路之拆改，不知已耗費初進同志之經濟與光陰幾許矣。茲就研究所得，撰為有系統之叙述，庶幾初學者讀之，可免暗中摸索，茫無頭緒之苦</p>
<p>（一）電源　裝配收音機問題中之最重要，而最先應解决者，厥惟電源供給。在繁盛城市，電廠多數供給日電，則宜採用交流電源，雖開辦費略昂，但直流機甲乙電池之經常支出，較之交流機之電費，何止倍蓰。但交流電源取給於强電流，偶不小心，卽有觸電之虞，故對於電學無相當學識者，更宜謹愼從事。鄙意初學裝配交流收音機，可先裝半交流式，祗需注意其初級二綫端，切勿以手接觸之，俟得相當經騐後，再試裝全交流式。至於在鄉僻鎭市，或雖有電廠而不供日電之處，則以直流電源為宜。</p>
<p>（二）眞空管　眞空管之職務，在無綫電中居於首要位置，所以電源决定後，卽應選擇眞空管之式樣與號數，以便就其特性，配製電源及各種零件。現在歐美各國，眞空管之製造，雖日新月異，愈出愈多，但各司工作，互相搭配，不可彼此更換，所以在初裝之時，卽須顧及擴充地步，以免初購之管，廢棄無用。經鄙人與諸業餘家之研究結果，在直流以30，32，33，34，及在交流以36，38，39，77，78，等號眞空管最為經濟耐用。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c205">聽筒充磁的改良 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 陳斌輝</p>
<p>聽筒失去了磁性，也就失去了它的效用。我們常見各無線電刋物上，載着關于充磁的種種方法，不外將聽筒二脚相觸於高電壓的正負極，一剎那便能恢復磁性，可是經作者試騐尚有改良之處，今述之於後。</p>
<p>作者的聽筒是德貨歐比牌（Erpees）已經用了二年多，磁性已漸漸消失，因照上述方法，將聽筒的二脚，分別在代B電的正負極上一　觸，揢搭一聲，聽筒的一只磁力，是很强了，可是另外一只，反將磁性完全失去（本來二只平均的）於是就把聽筒的二脚掉轉一觸，結果恰如上述相反，總之，觸來觸去，終衹能充足一隻的磁力，作者就將聽简膠木蓋旋去，揭去鋼膜，拆出甲乙兩線頭之銲接處，接以較長的導線，（如圖一）一分別充之（如反無效，則易導線二端）如此則兩只聽筒，均可恢復原有的磁力，决無上述的弊病。</p>
<h3 id="c206">檢波氏三極眞空管電壓表 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>（續一百〇六期）</p>
<p>如吾人欲測量輸入交流電壓之最大值，可於圖一之栅路內，於固定丙電池C外，另挿入一可變之電池E，另以直流電壓表V與之相接，藉以測量E之負電壓，如圖三所示。當無電壓輸入時，E之值應為零，（卽V電壓表所示電壓為零，）於是棚路內僅有負電壓CMA電流表此時僅示微量之電流值。如有電壓輸入時，屏路電流勢必增加，於是可將栅負壓E增加，至屏流仍至原值為止（卽無電壓輸入時之屏流.）此時V電壓表所示之電壓，卽為栅路所增加之負壓：此負壓之值，卽等於輸入電壓之最大值。故V所量之電壓為輸入電壓之最大值。</p>
<p>（二）栅檢波眞空管電壓表，係應用栅檢波電路，如圖四所示。Cg為栅電容器，Rg為柵漏，C為枝路電容器；E為平衡電池。因此種電路，栅路無丙電池，當栅路無電壓輸入時，屏路仍有相當直流，可增加E之電壓，以减低MA電流表之電流至MA所示之直流恰等於零為止。如外來電壓輸入栅路，則屏路電流必起變化，E之電壓失却平衡作用，於是此變化之屏流流經MA，MA之指針便轉至相當位置。此MA所示之電流，卽可測量輸入電壓之值為若干，一如上述。</p>
<p>柵檢波眞空管電壓表，對於測量低微交流電壓比屏檢波式更為靈敏，但消耗電力較多，且屏流在無電壓輸入時頗大。故非需要極高靈敏度時，栅檢波式不如屏檢波式。</p>
<p>總而言之，眞空管電壓表所以優於普通電壓表者，蓋有下列兩益：</p>
<p>（一）本身消耗電力極微極微，故以之量某綫路之電壓，此綫路之電流，不為所擾。</p>
<p>（二）如其屏路之傍路電容器，配置得當，可與所量電壓之週率無關。故以低週率校騐之眞空管電壓表，亦可以之測量高週率電壓。</p>

<p>在五年前，有一位某大學敎授，曾經說：「今後考試權實行了，有資格的人，都有飯吃。」可是時至今日，這放倒未必盡然。還是某要人說得爽快，他說：「什麼資格不資格，我說一句話，就是資格。」</p>
<p>潘女士，今年年紀還只十九歲呢！有一次，同位朋友談論婦女解放問題。伊說：「……你們可知道「解放」兩字是怎樣解釋的？所謂解放，就是脫離舊禮敎的羈絆，一切行動，絕對自由；對於女子和異性通情書，談戀愛，爲父母的不應干涉，社會上更不應加以批評和指摘，這就是「解放」兩字的眞意義！」</p>

<p>中國的畫和字在原始時代是合一的，字就是畫，畫就是字。後來畫的部分進步再進步，從寫實到象徵，宋代的畫院，以詩爲題，更使畫家走上意境方面去，寫生便不爲畫家所重。到了清代的四王更努力於山水畫，幸虧有一位獨闢新徑的惲南田，在寫實上顯出他的天才來，竟能與四王分庭抗禮，中國的寫生復見中興。</p>
<p>可惜定生畫不能得到鑒賞家的提倡，繼起者眞是寥落，因之依然被目爲小家數。近代世界潮流趨向寫實，寫生畫又得抬頭。我們蘇州有好幾位畫家能夠發揮他們的藝術精微，像已經離開蘇州而到上海的程瑤笙，便是一位代表。至今還在蘇州的有陳迦　·他的門弟子柳君然，能傳其衣缽。迦　的寫生不僅是栩栩欲活，並且章法也是很生動活潑，獨抒靈機的。最近他盡了一幅「花下雞雛，」大半帕的月季花，繁英茂葉，充滿著生氣，下半帕畫著七個雛雞，毛羽未豐，天機活潑，象徵著一個幼稚園。這幅畫陳列在正社首都畫展裏，得到不少的讚美，後來給陳璧君女士以六十金易去的。現在迦　重畫一張，比前更嫵媚動人了。還畫了一幅「紫藤乳鴨」畫出春江水暖的詩意，和一百年前吳江的翁小海，有同樣的神妙。（翁氏最擅長寫生，有翁烏龜之稱。）君然畫花卉果蔬，也別具機秄。聽說他們師生倆要到上海漢口睡的文藝社去展覽，這種有科學頭腦文學手腕的寫生畫，一定能夠載譽而歸的。</p>
<p>末了，我還要報告一個消息，以霍桑探案弛名的程小青，也是迦　的高足，將有「魚樂」及梅花翎毛等作附麗著小說家的畫，或者要特別得到人們的欣賞了。</p>

<p>— 茶碗</p>
<p>據說茶性極淫，好喝茶的人，會上癮，我就是上了癮的一個，我從前不大喝茶，現在已經和伊熱戀到一百二十度，每天非伊不可了！</p>
<p>但是我的愛情，是專一的：祗喝六安茶，而不喝其他的：武夷，祁門，龍井，洞庭……之類的茶，雖然我都和伊們發生過戀愛，結果是整個的我被六安茶獨佔了；無論什麼茶，都覺得沒有六安茶的味厚，沒有六安茶那末溫存！俊俏！柔媚！也潑辣，風騷！</p>
<p>我常常拿古代的美人比茶，六安茶是和王昭君一樣的美貌，一樣的遭遇的。六安的茶，除極少數在皖北銷集外，幾乎完全給山東幫包銷到北幾省去了，他們運去之後：用珠蘭，茉莉，做成薰花茶，把伊本來的面目，完全掩住了。北方人喝茶的法子更慘酷，大茶壺是有名，成把的葉子，塞進壺裏頭，大碗的斟出來喝，簡直和王昭君和鬚毛如戟的番王講同居之愛，是一樣的焚琴煮鶴的事情啊！</p>
<p>六安茶，偶然也有到南方來的時候，但是南方人都給西施般的龍井茶媚惑慣了。誰去理睬王昭君！大概到南方的六安茶，雖然不是雙　，卻也都是下品，我在上海，就買不著眞正好的六安茶。</p>
<p>眞正好的六安茶，一旗一槍，色，香，味，都在龍井之上。尤其是「班針」，微煮之後，香味甘芳，怎不敎人醉三日呢？話又說回去了，茶，好比女人，龍井，是浣紗女；碧螺春，是小姐；班針，是雍容華貴，成熟透的少奶奶；你如果是病相如，眞要解你的消渴病的話，你一定是要追求著少奶奶的吧？</p>
<p>用力吧！要碾平這世途的崎嶇。</p>

<p>第十一回　夜話凄涼生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>可是打聽著姨太太這個位子，不是一跳就跳上去的。還得先在小西天跑上幾個月。我這位同鄉小姐，他看到姊妹都這樣的做過了，他有什麼不可以做？忽然的也傳染了上小西天這個毛病。總算是他沒有白跑，不到半個月，有了新料子的衣服，有了皮鞋和手表，有人陪了去看陜西梆子戲。差不多也就快到坐自用騾車的那一步上去了。就在那時，遇到了一位男同鄉，把他帶到開封去過了半年。大概是那位男同鄉，不要他了，他只好又回到陝西來。可是去過了東方，更摩登了，自己要用錢，家庭也要用錢，只好再跑小西天，把身體零碎換些錢用。可是他丈夫家是個守舊人家，能容這件事嗎？就把他的婚事退了。他呢，雖沒有回過江南老家，到過比西安繁華好幾倍的開封，他知道在東方做姨太太是怎樣舒服。以前以爲坐自用騾車，帶上一個穿制服的跟人，那就了不得，現在知道，那是毫無足取的了。不過心裏儘管看不起人，還得去敷衍那些看不起的人，纔能夠有飯吃，有衣穿，有大煙癮過。我，就是這樣。可是我想到無廉恥的事，絕對不能做了下去。老實說，賣身子，是賣一點姿色，賣一點年輕。我一天比一天老了，我一天比一天難著了，再敷衍下去，我一定餓死在西安，不能回家鄉了。說到了這裏，他聲音又哽咽住了，彷彿是說不下去。不過他立刻想到老是對人哭，那也沒有意思。因之借故站起來倒茶，敬客一杯，自喝一杯，打個岔，把這事牽扯過去了。（一七〇）</p>

<p>現在就讓我約略講一些官裏面製絲的手續。那些繅好的生絲分爲一絞一絞的整理好之後，還得漂洗一次，讓日光給晒乾了，然後再染上各樣的顏色。染色當然也不是一次可以了事的；總得染上兩次或三次，最後才取出來晒乾。伊們所住的偏殿的近旁，各有一方石坪，那裏便是晒絲的所在。晒絲的時候，還得用許多的竹製的三腳架；它們的高度都是不很高的，因爲太高了那些女孩子們便攀不到。每兩個三腳架的中間，擱著一根很光潔的竹桿；那些染好了的絲，便一絞一絞地掛在上面晒著，但事情卻並不這樣簡單！當初晒的時候，必須先看太陽光照射的方向，不能讓那些絲上一半晒到陽光，一半晒不到陽光；過了相當的時間，又得把它們翻過來或移動移動，務必使它們所受的感光的時間非常均勻，那末絲的顏色便不致一塊深，一塊淡了。（二八一）</p>

<p>因爲笑終究是歡樂的表示，雖然在悲慘的環境，或許因了知的滲雜，使悲哀的力量，更加深入人心；像銀屏上卓別林演出的笑劇，在源源不絕的笑聲裏，含蓄著深刻的悲哀，好似喝著一盃濃的咖啡，收口時感覺到的那股苦味。然而正因著這股苦味，才可以使人感到興奮，感到這笑有著深長味兒，可供咀嚼！下面寫的幾則笑話，就是例子。</p>
<p>名貴的筆墨　以前一個讀書人，他寫的字，雖然書蚓塗鴉，不成格局，可是他卻自以爲龍蛇飛舞，別有豐韻，居然老著臉幹起賣字爲生的書家生活來。他自知自己所寫的字，可以駭庸俗而不足以欺識者，於是他奇想天開，他的潤格，對於所用的筆墨，特別提出宣傳，什麼宋代狼毫，什麼明代鵝筆，寫得名目繁多，至於古墨，更名目眾多，價值昂貴。有一天這位大書家，爲宣傳起見，特地寫了一付對聯請當代某聞人品題，那聞人瞧了他的字跡，又瞧了他的潤格，就毫不游移的題贈了五個大字：「名貴的筆墨」。</p>
<p>賞給了我罷　乾隆皇帝遊獅子林，樂極志形，題了「眞有趣」的三字御筆。幸虧他的臣子高士奇知趣，索去「有」字，這不通的題句，才沒有沾污名勝。在這整理名勝，提倡風景的當兒，一班附庸風雅的縉紳先生，興高題辭，就也不時鬧出「眞有趣」的笑話來。在整理虎邱聲中，頭山門上經某聞人的高見，擬就了「古吳攬勝」四字；某報編者，覺得　這「攬」字「賞給了我罷」，另寫了兩個「境」「跡」作交換，請他改做「古吳勝境」或「古吳勝跡」。</p>
<p>學問的進步　從前有一個讀書人，看中了一個賣酒的女兒，他寫了許多駢四麗六的情書，接二連三的寄去，可是好像石沉大海，絲毫沒有回音，直到讀書人相思成病，奄奄一息的當兒，由僮兒代寫了一封別字連篇的書信送去，那女兒才備夜趕來了。讀書人接著了，在欣喜之下，問他何以前次不來。那女兒笑道：「你前次的來信，讀都讀不通，知道你的學問，實在還是不通！今天的信，一見完全明白，怎敎人不生愛憐的心，因此即忙趕來瞧你哩」。讀書人聽了，只氣得兩眼直，雙腳挺，就此死去。</p>
<p>唯我獨尊　某文學家在講臺上演講的時候把古往今來的有名文名，一個個的加以批評，說得統統一文不值，這時有一個聽講的學生，聽得生氣了站起身來問道：你說古今文人，這個不好，那個不好，那麼最好的文人，當然祗有先生一個人了？文學家聽了頻頻點頭道，「誠然！誠然！」這時臺下不由轟出了一片熱烈的笑聲。</p>

<h3 id="c214">君子遠庖廚 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>小時候被關在「老法學堂」裏唸古書，背而不講，所以有什麼「警句」「絕句」之類，未能领悟，含糊過去，後來悔恨莫及，然猶思急起直追，時常翻翻木版大字的書本，而且對於古人的說法，頗肯加以研究，日積月累，不免略有心得，而緊跟在心得後面的，仍然是糊塗和納罕，煩惱之至。</p>
<p>譬如我最近翻到一句「君子遠庖廚」，又呌我颇費斟酌。照書本子上的意思，說君子是有了惻隱之心的，他不忍聽廚子司務在廚房裏殺生害命，和那些雞羊畜類頸項裏噴血時的慘呌，所以他坐得遠點，免得心裏鬱然失歡，問題原很简單。然而正因為太簡單了，容易引動我腦筋。</p>
<p>倒並非對於君子遠庖廚這一派人道主義有所反感，現在所欲得而問焉的，乃為君子府上庖廚裏那種殺生害命的舉動，究竟誰使為之，孰令致之？我想東家不吃肉，廚子司務决不會無端的屠一條猪。而且，據考證之下，古時君子不吃肉的難得，那麼，旣食其肉矣，又何必不忍聞其聲？你要决心用槍打死你的敵人，而猶揚言不忍你的敵人流血，是何語耶！如此想來，古之君子處處善裝假，善套假面具，所謂人道也者，毒丸上面的一層糖衣而已。</p>
<p>然而，豈獨古之君子為然哉，不亦觀夫今世之君子耶！他們的面孔上·假惺惺的，他們的手段，够巧妙的，他們常常扯着嗓子說：「我普受眾生，我酷嗜和平，我將永遠是個好人……」而他兩隻手裹，一隻是糖和麻醉品的混合物，一隻却握着最尖銳的屠刀，或者，他們自己耽做着廚子的工作。等到你做了他爼上之肉，於是他張着血盆大口：「哈哈．你自己不掙氣啊。」一口咽下之後，他仍是個君子，仍會說：「我不忍殺生害命。」其實，他還站在庖廚的門首。</p>
<p>說不定人類生下就有了哄騙的天資，同時人類亦甘受哄騙，死而無怨。否則，為什麼「君子遠庖廚」這類哄人的勾當，至今反而變平加厲呢？</p>
<h3 id="c215">船過厦門海峽 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 空明</p>
<p>輪船將進厦門海峽的時候，遠遠便被雨行綿延的山脈所拘束着。船慢慢地爬i看見丈惧所瞪射的絛上．漁舟成羣地扯起巨帆，在海上飄揚。一和輪船相贴近，漁入时赤黑的臉孔。和粗健的臂膊，便清楚地可見。在遠處，山的脊峯被太陽所輝耀，把那青色的明亮的臉色完全呈現出來。在或一個山抝，却見漁人們所聚成的村落，被深綠色的樹叢所掩蔽，形成一小堆的暗影。</p>
<p>海鳥從很遠的海上跟着輪船的尾巴，一入海峽，鳥羣越聚便越多，輪船的舵尾在海上滾起了一長條的白浪，淺藍色的水面滿泛了白沫。鳥羣便永遠用恨睛盯住這些白沫，然後，突然用尖利的嘴巴向海一沉、隨卽便　起一尾魚兒來，慢慢地吞向是口裏去。此後，又再跟着輪船遨翔，不住地打着旋轉，毫不覺得疲倦般地，一直到輪船的機聲停止的時候。</p>
<p>從第一次看見厦門地界的山，以遠厦門和鼓浪嶼，在水程上幷不很是短促。不住地看見山和被拘束住的河樣的海，二個鐘頭間才到達厦門。輪船最初從鼓浪嶼的背面繞過。一看到白日里的白色燈塔的建築物，鼓浪嶼的密叢叢的一洋式屋子便跟着露现出來。那色調是異常鮮明和整齊，一和綠色的樹林陪襯着，映在日光裏，從海上浮起了秀嶼，那</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>風景便覺得非常地美麗，使旅客都探出頭來，不住地把眼光盯住在那秀嶼上面。</p>
<p>輪船從鼓浪嶼的背面轉過來，正面的景面便更以雄偉和秀麗的面目呈出來。那屋子是擠得更加繁密，和兀立得更加高大？許多紅色的磚牆，配上繁密的窗戶，直向厦門對峙。那情形一看起來，眞像帝國主義一直在向中國的門戶——厦門挑　呢？</p>
<p>接着厦門市便以新的姿態顯示出來。在海濱，一長排的高大的洋屋子完全以白色的牆壁矗立着。輪船一靠近，××洋行或××旅社的招牌便用很大的字眼向旅人招手。在大屋子的隙縫，街街吐着牠的大口。汽車的轟轟聲和人力車的鈴聲便都從空中傳過來。而都市的喧嚣又刺着旅人的神經了。</p>
<p>夜專船泊在厦門的時候，鼓浪嶼的燈光從半山間閃燦，繁密得有如天上的星光。厦門的市聲則異常嚣雜，與對岸的幽靜一比，眞如劃成二個世界。晚間，小船兒欵乃聲隨處都有，偶然雜着一兩聲汽笛，從水上空間拂過，眞令人會以為置身在威尼斯的水鄉哩！</p>
<p>月光在水上映射，海面上便泛出一片白光來。小船的燈火孤寂得像一革點的螢火蟲，一和兩岸的電燈光相比較，又像螢火之於媒油燈光了。</p>
<p>翌晨船又從厦門海峽開行。慢慢地剝開岸，小販的小擔子都從輪上溜去，消失了招賣的喊聲。鼓浪嶼的美景又慚漸從眼前逝去，輸船又在海水上刮起一長條的白沫，而海烏又成羣地飛來了，永遠迥旋在輪船的後面。</p>
<p>又繞過了鼓浪嶼，又被拘束在兩行的山脈中間。一直到溜出丁廣　的六海，已經不知道經過了幾多時候，而海烏也在不知不覺間消失得不見隻影了。</p>
<h3 id="c216">歸來 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>接到朋友要返上海的信底第二天晚，我們七年的老同學意外迅速地來訪我了。在歡欣與驚奇之下，我們緊緊握着手，半響沒有言語，彷彿互相領會着寂寞的快慰：像我們從前同居的時候一樣</p>
<p>我們畢業之後，我很快地找到一個寫字間的職位，他相反地到處碰壁，一個剛從學校之門裹踏出來的純潔的靑年那樣深深地戚到了失望，他幾乎傷失了進取的雄心。這時候，我在蝸居的樓中為他設了個舖位，他就成天睡在床上，沒有思慮，好像這就是他生存的意義。我公畢歸家，瞧見了他那張呆着的臉，——而且也感到自身職業的朝不保夕，從想不起一句安慰或者鼓勉的話。這種寂寞的生活延長到他進舅父的買辦間。</p>
<p>本來這是條很好的路子，但是或許他是個大學生的綠故，沒有想到吃飯要靠本頒以外的捷徑。記得做完了第一天工作，他曾對我說要不是舅父的誠意，他决不願幹這種機械化的事情，他覺得這個社會全不是在學校裹時候所想像的，牠是那樣張着毒口，吞噬每一個靑年純潔的心！但是有經騐的舅父，在識破了他的失望的時候，以整個商業上的課本去敎導他，使他瞭解吃飯的藝術。</p>
<p>在這種學識的薰陶之下，我們的蝸居中也開展了可貴的新氣象，如果人生可以分成二個段落的話，我們是踏進了另一個階級中去體騐人生了。</p>
<p>一年後，他舅父在淮北收買了一個分廠，他負了監視該廠經理行動的重大責任和我分手。這是前年冬季的事。</p>
<p>起初時常讀到他的信，他告訴我許多北方的民間情形，生活狀態。他說那里是他理想中的社會，他要努力做事，報答舅父給他重復做人的機會。我慶幸老友的機遇好，從前所沒有想起的話，二一股兒從信上傳達給他。</p>
<p>去年夏天以後，他的信稀少了，或是短短的問候之類，他要我多寄一些滬上的出版物，及一份報紙——那裹除了警察局之外，全縣沒有第二份報數——以解寂寞。於是我跑了二天四馬路，為他訂了三份刊物，並選購了十來部可以讀讀的書籍就是我書架中認為好一點的讀物，陸續寄給他。</p>
<p>年底他返上海。我接到他抵滬的日期，到車站去迎接，但是一個到理想中的社會去努力的靑年完全變了，變了一個沒有知覺的軀殼了。他哭了，他的努力虛投在市儈底技巧提掌中，他把最後的幾個月過着宿娼狂飲的生活，這樣他才不至於自殺。，但是他不願意舅父知道，今春含着淚重赴淮北。三個月來沒有接到他路上平安以外的第二個信。</p>
<p>這次意外的歸來，我們相見後他第一句對我說：「失業了！」</p>
<p>自然，這個果實早在開花之前成熟了的，是一個想以學校中的課本去適應環境的大學生應得的結局。這社會和我們理想中的正是背道而馳呢！如果不願把自已染成一四彩色的布，失業永遠彷　形影一般追隨在你的身後！</p>
<p>我望着他那張失去了知覺的臉，把湧塞着的話咽住在喉頭。</p>
<h3 id="c217">酒徒麻三子 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 春雲</p>
<p>火盆似的太陽，靜悄悄地沉到西邊的樹膠園背後去了。風「陣陣地從樹膠園裹掠過來，雜帶着一點樹膠的香味，辣刺着人們的鼻孔。</p>
<p>這時，樹膠園裹的工人，嘻嘻哈哈地從會計處拿到他們賞天的勞力的代價出來，他們似乎忘掉了白天工作的疲憊，忘掉了黑炭似的臉孔上滲出來的汙珠，和忘掉了給汗水濕透了半截上衣，像從水裹持起來，淋淋地滴着水點。他們成羣地走進永興「土頭」的酒店裹去，忘掉了一切，痛痛快快地乾牠個三杯五杯</p>
<p>永興「土頭」的酒店，就開在樹膠園的右邊，店裹的顧客，自然是樹膠圃裹的工人。店，約莫有二丈把寬，低矮得一伸手就可以摸着屋頂，屋頂是用「亞答」樹葉蓋成的，風掠過，上面就響着沙沙的聲音。店外還有兩棵高屹的棕樹，像矗立兩根旗竿，但上面却缺少兩面搖幌的酒旗。</p>
<p>每天一到太陽沉沒在西邊的樹膠國後去的時候，永興「土頭」的酒店的生意就旺盛起來。永興「土頭」站立在櫃枱前手裹搖着一把扇子，挺着凸出來的肚子，嘻皮笑臉地在招呼顧客，店子裏面的桌子，却佔滿了許多油黑得像鬼樣的工人，一面喝着酒，一面笑哈哈地高談着樹膠園裹發生的新奇的新聞。</p>
<p>滿臉有着蜂窩似的斑點的麻三子，跟蹌地從樹膠園裏跨出來，遠遠地，永興「士頭」就向他招呼着。他也是他酒店裹的主顧之一，每天得上店裹來乾個三五杯。</p>
<p>當麻三子的影子閃進來的時候，裹面的許多工人一看見他就裂着黑嘴，對他做個鬼臉，用譏笑的腔調說：</p>
<p>「麻三子，今天工頭可有多給你的工錢」？</p>
<p>「自然囉！讓老婆跟工頭睏一覺，怎麼會得不到好處」？另一個人揮着嘴搭訕。</p>
<p>「麻三子，呌她來跟咱睡一回，成不成」？於是，全店子裏的人都笑了。</p>
<p>麻三子在這種塲合之下，眞是使他哭笑不得的。想要跟他們鬧，似乎又覺得沒有什麼意思，而且事情鬧大出去，那好像當風頭揭開馬桶蓋，臭得更加遠點，不合算；緘默呢，又近於示弱！他終於也打哈哈地用着半滑稽的答腔。</p>
<p>「老子對於女人，從來就不放在眼裹，……你入你媽的，陪你睏一覺，有什麼問題」！隨後舉起手來，沉重地在桌子上敲下一拳。「「土頭」！來一碟魚乾，兩斤白酒」。似乎一這樣，滿肚子的悶氣，就會發洩得乾乾凈净了。</p>
<p>麻三子一面喝着酒，心裹却大大的不高興。雖則他的嘴裹儘管說「不把女人放在眼裹」，然而女人跟着別人家睏覺，無論如何對他是一種恥辱！他把酒一杯一杯地灌到肚子裹去，二斤過了再加二斤，一直灌到「亞答」屋頂在旋轉，眼睛盡網着紅絲，像兩顆紅球，酒杯沉重得提不起來，才一歪一扭地走出了店門。</p>
<p>當麻三子一歪一斜的蹣跚到家裹的門口，他的女人却從裹面跑出來，扶着他的粗糙的臂膊說：</p>
<p>「哎喲！你又去喝酒了，喝得這樣地醉迷迷！」……</p>
<p>「騷貨！你幹得好事，老子今天可不依你了！……」大了，他看見他的女人悶在肚子裹的氣又脹，他揪着她的短頭髮，兩點似的送上許多沉重的巴掌。</p>
<p>於是，他底女人哇啦哇啦的哭了。而他却倒在地板上，呼呼地睡去，像一堆泥。</p>

<p>蘇聯的國際影展開幕了。我們中國也選了七張名片去參加，而且還有胡蝶女士、隨同顏大使和梅蘭芳等共同出洋赴俄。於是，人們的注意也就不得不轉向到蘇聯，特別是她的電影上去了。</p>
<p>這倒使我回憶起六七年前看過的幾張蘇聯片子來。那時我追隨着我的父親僑居在隣近蘇聯國境的一個拉脫維亞的小城裹。我們時常看得到蘇聯的影片</p>
<p>第一次看見的，同時印象留到現在還不曾消去的，是一張名呌「梁尚省的鄉姑」的悲劇片。</p>
<p>片中申鄉姑的主角，記得是蘇聯的女明星崔沙而斯加耶。背景是典型俄國式的農莊。</p>
<p>劇情是如此：梁尚省的一個農家，父親和子女二人，過着很快樂的生活。同村裹有一個小姑娘，父子二人都很歡喜她。終於兒子和她相愛了，結了婚。</p>
<p>但新婚不久，兒子被革命政府徵發去參加國內戰爭了。一去就是三四年，這中間是音訊全無。父親在這時候竟强姦了他的媳婦，而同時又巧得很，媳婦受了孕。</p>
<p>翁媳間的關係，本來是强迫的。她始終還是期待着丈夫的回來。然而肚子大了，兒子又生了下來。這可什麼辦呢？她戚到精神上的痛苦，日夜啼哭着，幸虧小姑待她還好，勸慰着她。</p>
<p>最後，戰爭停止了，兒子却並沒有作沙塲之鬼，歡天喜地的回家來了。他一路幻想着：父親見了他會流着歡喜之淚吧；愛妻當然會吻他，也許會歇斯底里地呌了，悲喜交集地在訴着幾年來別後的情形，自然是最快活的了。</p>
<p>到了家，呀！情形可並不像他所想像的。家中人見了他的回來，簡直大家嘿然！父親懷着鬼胎，冷冷地跑開了，妻子的手裹却抱着一個小孩，見了他，眼睛只是望着地，潛潛地淌着淚。</p>
<p>他明白了，失望了，憤恨了。不由分說地，他把妻子毒打了一頓。妻在這中間有什麼好說呢？負着心身的創痛，她跑出了屋子。外面是熱鬧得很，鄉人們正在賽會取樂，但這却更形容出她的孤單，一個人坐在溪邊的石上，茫然地，眼瞧裹包滿了眼淚，和風吹來揚起了她柔黑的頭髮；又將滴滴的眼珠灑進了脚下的流水，眼淚流完了，她也就跟着躍進了深溪。</p>
<p>人們喧嚷起來了：兒子也給這聲音從痛苦中驚醒轉來，奔出屋子去。鄰人已經把死了的婦人擱在溪邊。黑髮散着，美麗的臉子像向蠟一般的蒼白；可是又耀着光輝，兒子不由的跪了下去，抱着這屍身而痛哭了。</p>
<p>看熱鬧的人　在四邊，老婆子們都在忙着劃十字禧告上帝，誠樸的農民們，都在為這奇離的悲劇揮着同情之淚。好一會兒之後，兒子抬起頭來，在淚光裹看見了人叢中站着的父親，滿面是澳悔而慚愧的。這時兒子的臉上，表示出一種難言痛恨！</p>
<p>劇情是那麼婉轉而深刻的，牠不知贏得了多少痴心男女們的眼淚，我看過已經六七年了，但是祇要一時想起，心上總會微微地掠過一陣酸意！無怪這片子，開演了許多年，始終還是有呌座的能力。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c223">評「空中血案」 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 鏟非</p>
<p>Murder　in　the　Clouds</p>
<p>—大光明</p>
<p>大凡偵探影片總離不了大盜和警察。大盜們窮兇極惡，同時也聰明，狡滑，然而到後來總逃不出警察之手。而落法網，惡徒自當惡報。如上所述，差不多是一般偵探影片的公式，「空中血案」也不能例外。至於男主人翁大功即成，愛情亦得圓滿，也是一般平庸的偵探影片必然的穿挿。</p>
<p>對於如此庸俗的影片，幾乎使我們沒有什麼可說，這樣公式化的故專構結，常看影片的諸君大概也下分熟悉的了。</p>
<p>這裹正面的自然是勸人不做强盜，可是相反的效果，大盜們大規模的組織與設備，對於挺而走險的人們，正是可怕的誘惑。當然我們也不說，沒有誨盜影片便沒有盜匪滋擾。盜匪活動的科學化，正是現社會之特　。但是這裹終不免有些近於海盜，雖然劇本編作者的本意，是竭力宜揚國家警察組織之嚴密，暗示着美國社會的安寗。</p>
<p>餘上所虛　　　因　　　　　　强烈的刺激性，被製片家視為生財之道就在這用意之下，「空中血案一便以飛機運軍火作為主要的塲面。飛機聲，槍彈聲，都是危險而驚駭的。不過因為導演和表演者都是庸俗與低能，並沒有如他們所預期的一樣獲得較好的成績。至於要在這裹指明那一塲面較好，那些地方頂壞，似乎是多餘的事，老實說，這一影片不能使人們感到多大的興趣，只是一部平凡的作品而已。</p>
<h3 id="c224">評「珍珠島」 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>“Pirate　Treasure”</p>
<p>——卡爾登映</p>
<p>這是一張有着極長的故事，而除了大打出手，逃與追，跌與跳這些驚險的演出之外，又似乎沒有什麼的武俠片。</p>
<p>飛行家狄克宣佈他將往某小島發掘他先祖埋下的珠實的消息，被一個律師勃萊期聽到了，就派遺了一批有本領的手下人去偷狄克的寶島地圖。於是跟着這地圖的偷來搶去，就讓主角狄克與這批人這樣的打來打去，大打一塲。</p>
<p>全片有七八塲交手的長戲，多是狄克赤乎空拳與單身力敵一大批人。他在空中水裹的往來自如，本領高强，看了眞呌人「嘆觀止矣」地有着我國古時劍俠之流的感想。可是呌人不敢置信的是：狄克旣身為全國景仰的飛行家，出　航空　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，常與名媛桃樂絲小姐作伴，也跟船長卡生計議要務，是個有名人物，何以會老是給那壞律師派遣的人糾繼着而跟他幹那謀財害命的勾當？怎麼不會驚動官府呢？靑天白日地狄克從五　樓上被打落下來，只見維持治安的警察輕輕地拍拍他的肩膀就由他自去了：堂堂船長派來做狄克的衛士的水兵被人當做草把那麼打着，船塲火車都做了混戰的塲所，沒有絲毫干涉，除非這世界是專為他們打架而有的了。「大做戲，就不是戲了」！觀衆中有人在這樣的說着</p>
<p>暫且拋開這些，我們就跟着製作者來看他們打架吧老實說，片中的打架塲面也實在處理得不見高明。老是那麼門牛般的亂撞一陣，而高空與海中的跌落，爬　跳車這套把戱，由於拍賣地一再應用的濫調，也失去了所謂驚險的趣味了，更何况如銀幕上所映出的黃色汽車逃，黑色車追，白汽船逃，黑汽船跟冗長重複，使人有些厭煩呢？</p>
<p>導演的技術不良，還不僅如此，例如全片有七八處關於壞律師與他的手下人通有綫與無綫電話的地方，這七八個地方的接通與掛斷的戲，就原版地沒有什麼不同。在狄克從危險中逃了之後，緊急與動蕩的塲面下，老是有這麼一段沉滯遲緩如桃樂絲小姐或別人的談話。而在兩個或三個人的談話中，同時寫別一面的進行時，不問寫得怎樣多，回到原來的盡面時也是一切依然。</p>
<p>要是說也多少有點好處的活，那末就在狄克夢中，挿入的那段他祖先埋藏珍竇時的古裝戲了。短短的書面，穩重的演出，却為全片生色不少的。</p>
<p>這是上集，我們且希望下集中有好戲看吧</p>

<p>「鐘樓怪客（Secret　of　the　Chateau），顧名思義，我們就可以想像它是怎樣神秘的一部影片了。</p>
<p>一個古堡的　樓上懸有一口古鐘，從來沒有人去敲它，也永沒有人到這個鐘樓上去，可是却有人傳說這口鐘自己會鴻，而在它自鳴的那一夜，便會有不幸的死降臨在古堡的一個人身上。請想，這該是如何神異的一椿奇談呀？</p>
<p>有了這樣的奇談，因此便有人藉着這種機會施行他的鬼計了。那天，鐘忽然自己嗚起來了，古堡裏的人們都恐怖着，果然當夜死去了一個人，而古堡中藏有一部極貴重的古書也因而失踪。接着，警探們正在偵查這件奇案的時候，而鐘聲又響，又有人死去了……這有多麼恐怖！可是不幸那個奸計多謀的暗殺犯不留神露出了馬脚，就在一個極緊張的情勢下破獲了這樁神秘的慘殺案。</p>

<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>克萊夫聽見了這個消息，立即和艾德蒙回到英國來。這次他的回來，岸上亦沒有歡呼的羣衆，亦沒有舊迎的人員，連瑪格勒蒂都沒有來！他悄然地下了船，上了岸，回到他皇后廣塲的舊宅裹。那是他的第一所住宅，就是他的第一個孩子死在裏面的的……冷冷淸淸一個人……正和他現在冷冷淸清一個人一樣。艾德蒙將克萊夫送到了皇后廣塲的住宅裏，立即跑到華爾各脫去見瑪格勒蒂，想在他們夫婦之間做個調人。</p>
<p>但是瑪勒蒂的心腸却已經橫了。他採取了兀然不動的鎭隱態度。她旣不　恨，亦不寬恕，好像不關痛癢似的。艾德蒙懇切地求着道：「你不能就這樣擲他在一邊。他還要對付余議院裏的仇人。他在受着審判的時候，他需要你的帮助，安慰和鼓勵。倘使這件事情弄糟了，身家性命一切邵完了。現在已是千鈞一髮之際，你怎能讓他一個人去祖當呢？」</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂道：「一個人是他目己情願的。一艾德蒙道：「或者他太驕傲了，不肯先來見你。」瑪格勒蒂道：「艾德蒙，我已經犧牲了這許多了。如果他驕傲的話，難道我就不能驕傲的嗎？不過，你見他的時候，請你替我問候他一聲。」艾德蒙憤然道：「你們這許多年的夫婦，到了現在還提着驕傲不驕傲嗎？」地說着，深深鞠了一個躬退出去了。</p>
<p>到了晚上，英國的下院中，已經楚擠滿了人，立無挿足之地，來聽這哄動全國的審判。瑪格勒蒂由克拉克隊長領導着，帶到一個黑暗的小過道之中，那裹有一扇窗，她可以聽到議院中的一切。她週身顫抖着，靜聽蘇烈文陳述克萊夫的財產，都是非法而來的。他主張將他的財產充公，並且將他交付懲戒。她又聽見莊斯東說，印度一切專利的弊病，都是克萊夫行出來的。他又指斥密爾耶法的禮物，是一種賄賂。她又聽見波哥英用滑稽的口吻，描寫他冒了海軍大將華德生的名字，簽訂條約的形狀，并且說一個卑鄙到假冒簽字的人，决不至於不肯受賄賂的。</p>
<p>一切攻擊的演說都完了，鼓掌之聲亦漸息了下去。勞伯特克萊夫站起來說話了。瑪格勒蒂更是氣也不透的靜聽着。克萊夫以沉着的聲昔發言道：「主席先生，攻擊我的一切話都說完了。我不能將攻擊我的一切，一個一個的答覆。凡是一個在社會上做事的人，你儘管將他的一切行為，屈解了來攻擊他。但是我有一句話，就是我的所作所為，是我盡心竭力的為印度，為我的祖國……」</p>
<p>他的聲音更加響亮了：「今天的投票，你們可以制奪我的一切，財產，爵位，和名譽……就如同印度已經剝奪了我所心愛的一切……」黑暗過道之中的瑪格勒蒂，聽到此處，不覺抽出乎帕來拭着自己的眼淚……『印度剝奪了我所心愛的一切……』她自己心上口相應的思維着。她自己不太苛刻了嗎？地的離開她，不是為了職務。爲了國家嗎？這怎能說他　愛了印　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　自悔恨起來</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial meeting for revolutionary martyrs on the morning of the 29th. Attendees included Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Yu Youren, Chen Lifu, Dai Chuanxian, Deng Jiayan, Zhang Fakui, Bo Wenwei, Huang Musong, Hong Ludong, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Zeng Kuangqing, Ding Chao-wu, Gu Zhenggang, Zhang Daofan, Wang Luyi, Duan Xipeng, Miao Peicheng, Bai Yunti, Zhao Pilian, Zhou Qigang, Chen Shuren, Zhang Zhen, Li Zonghuang, and representatives from various departments, including Niu Yongjian, as well as approximately six hundred comrades from within the Party Headquarters. The meeting commenced at 9:00 AM with music. Standing Committee member Yu Youren presided and led the entire assembly in paying respects to Sun Yat-sen's portrait and the memorial tablets of the revolutionary martyrs, also presenting wreaths prepared by the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees. Following a moment of silence, Bo Wenwei delivered a report, stating: "Today marks the anniversary of the sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang. I personally had the privilege of hearing accounts from comrades who participated in that battle, and thus learned the details of that uprising. I also learned that the number of comrades who died in that battle was more than seventy-two, as many volunteered to participate at the last minute and were sacrificed. However, only seventy-two of their names are known. We should recognize that the spirit of the martyrs of the Guangzhou Uprising, from the Battle of Zhennanguan to the Xinhai Revolution, and the spirit of sacrifice of the martyrs who died in previous revolutions, are all consistent. It was the extreme belief in Sun Yat-sen's ideology that led to these heroic acts of sacrifice. Therefore, in commemorating the martyrs of Huanghuagang, we should also commemorate the comrades who died in previous uprisings, as well as the unnamed heroes who sympathized with our Party and were sacrificed as a result. In the future, we should continue to uphold the understanding of Sun Yat-sen's ideology and the spirit of loyalty and courage towards the revolution demonstrated by the martyrs, and strive to fight, so that we can shoulder the heavy responsibility of eliminating internal troubles and external threats, saving the nation and ensuring its survival." Bo's speech concluded, and the meeting was adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">Legislative Yuan to Improve Deliberation Procedures <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan's established practice for handling cases submitted by the Central Political Council, the National Government, and other Yuan for deliberation has been to first refer them to committees for review, based on a resolution made at the weekly Yuan meeting. Subsequently, each committee would submit the cases to its own weekly meeting for resolution, appointing a committee member for preliminary review. After the review was completed, the cases would be submitted to higher-level meetings for further deliberation. President Sun Yat-sen believed that this method was uneconomical in terms of time and lacked simplicity. Improvements have now been made. Henceforth, upon receiving cases submitted for deliberation, the President will assign them to committees for review at any time, only reporting them at the Yuan meeting. When committees receive cases for review and deem a preliminary review necessary, the committee chair or convener will designate a committee member to handle it at any time, without having to wait for the weekly meeting procedure. After the review is completed, it will still be submitted to higher-level meetings for deliberation according to established practice. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Guiyang The main points of Commander Chiang Kai-shek's instructions at the Pacification Commissioner's Office on the 25th, regarding the suppression of the Communist bandits and the construction of a new Guizhou: (1) Everyone must make special efforts and unite to completely eliminate the Communist bandits in order to seek long-term stability and security for Guizhou; (2) Suppressing the bandits is saving the country and the people. The Communist bandits now want to completely eliminate our country's inherent virtues and culture, such as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, peace, etiquette, righteousness, and shame, and completely turn our people into beasts. Therefore, the Communist bandits are the common enemy of our country, and we must unite to eliminate them; (3) The people of Guizhou are pure, kind, thrifty, hardworking, and enduring. To prevent the people from becoming bandits, comrades from all party, government, and military circles must assist them with the Four Cardinal Principles and Eight Virtues, and even more so, love the people and pacify the people. Only then will the people love and support the government. Loving the people, pacifying the people, and educating the people are the fundamental essential tasks of suppressing bandits. I hope everyone will unite to achieve this; (4) Using the Four Cardinal Principles and Eight Virtues as the standards for all behavior will naturally enable the people to believe; (5) Now, to suppress the bandits and build the local area, the most important things are, first, to be trustworthy, and second, to be harmonious and cooperative, and to work hard according to the two principles of speed and accuracy; (6) There is also an important condition for success in life and career, that is, to always pay attention to improving our environment, so that all around us are good people, who all understand etiquette, know shame, are loyal and filial, practice benevolence and love, value trustworthiness, and advocate peace. In this way, the revolutionary spirit can be firm, and the revolutionary cause can be completed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>

They profit thirty yuan for every hundred yuan of silver coins and five to six hundred yuan for every hundred taels of silver. They also secretly contract for Japanese artificial silk and ramie yarn, which they deliver to Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe. The goods are delivered and smuggled at night, climbing in through the low points of the Great Wall at Jiaoshan, near Shanhaiguan. The carriers all carry weapons. If customs officials conduct thorough inspections, there will be a risk of life-threatening encounters. As a result, the amount smuggled in daily is incalculable. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Borrowing and Bond Issues Proceed Simultaneously <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— A Cold Observer</p>
<p>Since the autumn of last year, financial conditions have tightened sharply, and all industries have declined. The cities have followed the countryside and presented a desolate scene. In order to rescue the financial situation, the authorities are negotiating with the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries for a loan of 10 million pounds, while simultaneously issuing financial bonds worth 100 million yuan to expand bank capital. This dual approach aims to achieve the practical effect of circulating the economy and supporting industry and commerce. The bond regulations have now been passed by the Legislative Yuan, and the loan of 10 million pounds will be issued within days. Although the loan is still under negotiation, it is not certain whether it will succeed. However, according to foreign newspapers, international cooperation to rescue our country's finances seems to be a possibility. If the loan can be successfully secured, what impact will it have on our country's economy?</p>
<p>When the order to increase the silver export tax was first promulgated, those who did not understand the truth made reckless speculations, believing that inflation might be inevitable. As a result, capital fled, and silver continued to flow out. Later, the authorities repeatedly stated that they would not do this, and the news of the loan being pursued simultaneously spread in domestic and foreign newspapers. As a result, doubts were dispelled, and people's minds gradually settled down. The loan plan is the opposite of the inflation policy. If the goal is inflation, there is no need to rely on a loan. The decision to pursue a loan is clear evidence that inflation will not be adopted. This is why people's minds have suddenly become more stable. With people's minds at ease, capital will no longer flee, and the outflow of silver can be temporarily suppressed.</p>
<p>Our country's foreign trade has always been in deficit. Previously, we were fortunate to have large remittances from overseas Chinese and inflows of foreign capital to offset the deficit. In recent years, remittances have decreased sharply, and there has been less investment. International income has been insufficient to cover expenses, and gold and silver have been continuously exported, which is difficult to reverse. Although the economic recession has reduced purchasing power, foreign goods are not selling as well as in previous years. However, the decline in exports remains sluggish, and the imbalance persists. The amount of gold stored domestically is not large, and silver is needed to fill reserves, so how can we allow it to continue to flow out? Since it is difficult to export gold and silver to offset the deficit, we must rely on overseas credit. In order to stop the outflow of silver, the authorities are making every effort to secure a loan, which does not seem to be an inappropriate strategy to rescue the tight financial situation.</p>
<p>If the loan can be secured, it will ease the financial situation and provide some relief to the government's finances. It is a quick fix, and this measure is not entirely unreasonable. If we can address both the symptoms and the root causes, by using the proceeds of the loan to purchase construction materials and focusing on developing farmland and revitalizing water conservancy, domestic agricultural production will increase significantly, and food imports will decrease. At the same time, we should try to control unnecessary consumption to prevent the import of luxury goods, and implement the abolition of transit taxes and the reduction of export taxes to encourage the export of domestic goods. The trend of trade deficits may be reversed. If we can maintain the gold and silver stored domestically, the risk of financial tightening can be avoided.</p>

<p>(Moscow) When Eden and Litvinov continued their talks today, the Far East issue was the main event for discussion. Although details could not be obtained from official sources, it is widely believed that maintaining peace in the Far East and China's integrity are both under consideration. It is reported that several economic issues, loans to Russia, and the impact of the Ottawa Agreement on Anglo-Russian trade, especially timber, were also mentioned. This morning's talks lasted for one and a half hours and were conducted in the same sincere and trusting spirit as yesterday.</p>
<p>Eden and Stalin Have a Heart-to-Heart Talk</p>
<p>After lunch at the British Embassy, Eden went to Stalin's private room at 4:00 PM for a sincere conversation. Molotov, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, was also present. The meeting took place in a simply furnished long room with only portraits of Marx and Engels hanging on the walls. Through the windows, one could see the high walls of the Administrative Yuan. At the same time, attention is currently being paid here to the reorganization of the Polish government, and there is much speculation as to whether the new government will favor Germany to some extent. As Eden will be going to Warsaw in a few days, everyone is particularly concerned. There was heavy snow here yesterday, but this morning when Eden went from the embassy to meet with Litvinov, the sun was shining brightly, a completely different climate from yesterday.

<p>Japan Declares Policy Unchanged</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As rumors spread that the Anglo-Russian talks, which have attracted worldwide attention, will discuss the Far East issue, the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that although the Anglo-Russian talks will discuss the Far East issue, Japan's established Far East policy will never be changed, expressing the following views: The European situation is very different from before World War I, and its influence on the Far East is not as significant as before. We do not need to be concerned about the recent ever-changing European situation. Although the contents of the Anglo-German talks in Berlin cannot be known for sure, it seems to be a fact that Germany advocates strengthening its armaments against Russia. The worsening of German-Russian relations is a problem that can be noted in the future. The strengthening of German armaments has forced Soviet Russia to strengthen its defenses on the western European border, thereby reducing its defense efforts in the Far East. Therefore, it may not be known that it wants to obtain some kind of guarantee on this point. However, Japan has a definite policy on the Far East issue, implements its policy according to its own views, and will never be affected by the European situation. (29th Japanese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that no matter what changes occur in the overall European situation, Japan's policies towards foreign countries such as Soviet Russia will not be affected. Japan's foreign policy, as stated by the Foreign Minister in the Diet, is non-aggressive and non-threatening, and aims to maintain peace in the Far East. Japan has no plans to invade neighboring countries, but is prepared to rise up and defend them when peace is endangered. Asahi Shimbun carried an editorial stating that the only way out for the great powers is to give Germany some satisfaction and induce it to join a new peace pact. It also mentioned overseas comments speculating that Japan will take advantage of the newly arising disputes in the European situation and act freely in the Far East, saying that Japan has no intention of "fishing in troubled waters."

<p>This afternoon, Eden and Litvinov talked for two hours. The result seems to have made the United Kingdom and Russia more understanding of each other.

The points mentioned in the London Gazette on February 3 were all discussed, and the impact of the European situation on the United Kingdom and Russia was also explored in a spirit of mutual friendship. It is heard that Eden has not yet telegraphed his government, so he cannot put forward Britain's formal opinions in this afternoon's discussion, but Eden and Litvinov have clearly reached agreement on many points. The talks will continue at 11:30 tomorrow morning, when the relations between the United Kingdom and Russia will be discussed exclusively. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Tonight, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov hosted a banquet to welcome British representative Eden. The grandeur was unprecedented in Moscow for many years. Litvinov gave a speech on the spot, and after it was over, he raised a glass to wish the British Emperor a long life. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, this is the first time that a state official has raised a glass to wish the Emperor a long life. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Litvinov hosted a banquet yesterday to welcome Eden. Those accompanying him were Defense Commissar Voroshilov, Railways Commissar Kaganovich, Heavy Industry Commissar Ordzhonikidze, Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee Mezhlauk, Finance Commissar Grinko, Food Industry Commissar Mikoyan, Foreign Trade Commissar Rozengolts, Posts and Telecommunications Commissar Rykov, and other members of the Soviet government, British Ambassador Chilston and his wife, Lord Cranborne, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky (who came to the Soviet Union with Eden), Strong, head of the League of Nations group of the Foreign Affairs Committee, staff of the British Embassy, and senior officials of the Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech by Russian Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Litvinov gave a welcome speech on the spot, saying, "Mr. Eden's visit is an important milestone in the history of Soviet-British relations. Economic and cultural relations between the two countries have their normal and satisfactory development, and progress has also been obvious in the political aspect. Our country has long known what the people of your country are understanding. For example, Mr. Chamberlain recently said that the development of Soviet-British friendly relations is not hindered by anyone, and Mr. Zhang also said that "this kind of relationship is extremely important in preserving peace." At present, the work of preserving the normal international order has encountered serious and surprising difficulties. At this time, Mr. Ai's visit is extremely important, so its significance is especially important. Since the World War, there has never been such a great worry about the fate of peace as it is today. This kind of worry is the common feeling of all friends of peace and the vast masses of all countries. If they are not anesthetized by militarism and patriotism, they will surely be friends of peace for a long time. The largest number of countries at present yearn to preserve peace. There may be some exceptions at this time, but these dangerous places must at least be confined to one corner and clearly defined. Although, being able to confine them to one corner does not mean that they have been confined to one corner. We have no such intelligence to accurately predict that one country or certain countries will be greatly harmed by them, because this kind of danger is advancing in all directions. This situation has led all countries to urgently seek ways to hinder this kind of danger. Today, it is unanimously believed that if we want to completely eliminate the war crisis in Europe and the world, or reduce the degree of risk to the lowest limit, we can only rely on the cooperative efforts of all countries, especially the great powers.</p>
<p>When British policy signed an agreement with France on February 3, it took a step forward towards jointly preserving peace. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet government welcomes the London Agreement with great enthusiasm and is determined to fully cooperate. The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are located at the extreme east of Europe and the extreme west of Europe, and both are adjacent to other continents. Therefore, I believe that Anglo-Soviet cooperation is of decisive importance for peace, and your visit is not only the beginning of this cooperation, but also a guarantee for its long-term continuation. European politicians must be able to discern that the destruction of peace in any part of Europe will have extremely bad consequences. At the same time, they are aware that they bear a great responsibility. In the coming months or weeks, we will see whether they can organize peace in the way that the current international situation urgently requires, and implement the cooperation plan set on February 3 to obtain its wise and logical conclusion. However, in any case, Mr. Eden's frank exchange of views with me and my colleagues will surely contribute greatly to this work," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Eden's Response</p>
<p>Then Eden gave a reply, first thanking Litvinov for his kind welcome, and said that he was very pleased with what Litvinov said about this visit opening a new stage in the development of Anglo-Soviet relations. Although this trip is purely exploratory in nature and has no negotiating significance, "However, we can say that this first cordial conversation is indeed a remarkable and hopeful (I believe it is) milestone in the relations between our two countries," said Eden. Eden recalled the League of Nations' invitation to the Soviet Union to join the alliance, and stated that the British government's foreign policy is based on the League of Nations, and reiterated the importance of the Soviet Union's accession to the League of Nations. Eden also said that peace and improving diplomatic relations are the main purposes of the League of Nations, and at the same time, peace is the primary goal of British foreign policy. "I believe that this point must be the concern of the Soviet Union and other countries where the main purpose of all countries is to seek the well-being of their people. I firmly believe that this situation can only be improved by the representatives of the world's major powers talking frankly and exchanging views. This belief has not weakened since I recently visited various places. The main point of this trip is also here. The purpose of the subsequent Stresa foreign ministers' meeting and our meeting today is to find a way to get out of the current European predicament. These paths must be honest and respectable for all countries, and at the same time, be in line with the principle of cooperative security that we firmly believe in. Although we have differences in other issues, the above is our common position. I would also like to deeply believe that we will be able to move forward firmly to maintain peace," he said. After the meeting, there was a grand reception, attended by representatives of the diplomatic corps, Soviet public institutions, and domestic and foreign journalists. (29th TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, although the detailed facts of the Anglo-German talks are still being kept secret, it is gradually becoming clear that the "large differences of opinion" that Foreign Minister Simon stated in the House of Commons refer to fundamental principles. The visit to Berlin by Simon and Eden has not brought the different attitudes of the United Kingdom and Germany on the issue of group security closer. The current situation seems to be crystallizing into a political opposition between the "national" theory and the "group" theory. The British authorities now have to decide what attitude they should take towards European issues in the future. Eden's visits to Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague will be of vital importance to this point. What can now be assumed is that Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov will use the results of the Anglo-German discussions in Berlin as new argumentative material for supporting the Eastern European Convention. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Simon reported on the progress of the Anglo-German talks in the House of Commons today, tacitly admitting that there was no progress in the Anglo-German negotiations. Simon admitted that German leader Hitler's attitude was strong, so that the result of the talks had "discovered large differences of opinion." However, the Foreign Minister did not express despair, and said that the result of the talks had been quite valuable, and that both sides were able to understand each other's views. Simon also solemnly declared that this trip was only the first British consultation with various European countries, and that the final meeting would be held by representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy in Stresa, so it was not yet possible to explain the general situation in detail. As for the scope of the Berlin talks, it included all European issues and Germany's relationship to these issues. The Associated Press also learned from semi-official sources that Hitler had requested at least the return of one territory and the formal abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles as conditions for Germany's return to the League of Nations. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>What Will Britain Do?</p>
<p>(Paris) After British Foreign Minister Simon made a statement in the House of Commons yesterday, admitting that the views of the United Kingdom and Germany were far apart, the newspapers here commented that Hitler's five demands, revealed by the London Daily Telegraph, were actually true, even though the German government denied them. This can be evidenced by the speech of Foreign Minister Simon. "Le Petit Parisien" said, "The content of the denial issued by Germany only involves two of the five demands, namely (1) the return of the Polish Corridor to Germany, and (2) the return of the German minority settlement in the Czech Republic to Germany. This kind of denial is neither complete nor was it published until yesterday, so it is difficult for world opinion to trust it. As such, there is no doubt about the breadth of the demands made by Germany. Foreign Minister Simon did not hesitate to say that the opinions of the United Kingdom and Germany differed, but in order to observe diplomatic etiquette, he deliberately used vague words, but the negative impression that occurred on the first day of the Anglo-German talks has indeed proven to be true," "Paris Echo" reported, "It is easy for Germany to issue a denial, but if its content is clearer, and more detailed about what Hitler said and what he refrained from saying, then the world will be easier to believe," "Business Report" reported, "The United Kingdom now has two attitudes that it can take. One is to let Germany do whatever it wants, and the other is to actively organize a security system to deal with German hegemony. Foreign Minister Simon has already made it clear about all of this," and so on. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Attitude of Various Factions in Parliament</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Minister Simon frankly stated in the House of Commons today that the views of the United Kingdom and Germany are very different, which impressed people in parliament, because the conditions put forward by Germany, which were published in several newspapers recently, were generally true. The people in parliament have already known it very well. According to these newspapers, the conditions for Germany's return to the League of Nations are so shocking that the Conservative Party believes that these conditions are absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, they only hope that the countries in the Stresa meeting will maintain close contact to jointly ensure collective security. In the future, if Germany changes its demands, it will be allowed to join various collective security conventions. The Conservative Party especially supports the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty in Western Europe, because if something happens in Western Europe, the United Kingdom will inevitably be drawn into the vortex due to its geographical location. In addition, other mutual assistance conventions can be supported by the British government through purely diplomatic means, without direct participation. The opinions of the Conservative Party are generally like this. As for the Liberal Party and the Labour Party, they are quite disappointed by the too broad demands put forward by Germany, because the opposition parties of the Liberal Party and the Labour Party originally wanted to blame the responsibility for the failure of the talks on the government, so as to question the government. Now that Germany's requirements are so harsh, they turn to making the opposition parties unable to criticize the government. Some Labour MPs said that Hitler's demands are the maximum demands, and they will surely be greatly reduced after negotiations with France. In short, the attitude of the Liberal Party and the Labour Party will largely be determined when Simon presents a report after the Stresa meeting. If Simon's report shows that Germany's tough attitude is irreversible, then the position of the Liberal Party and the Labour Party will naturally be weakened, because there is nothing to attack the government with.

<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph reports that the German government, during talks in Berlin, proposed the recovery of pre-war colonies as a condition for rejoining the League of Nations and establishing an Anglo-German alliance, thereby obtaining what Kaiser Wilhelm II called "a place in the sun." The Anglo-German alliance plan would correspond with all of Germany's demands, and the colonies lost after the war should be returned to their original owners. Regarding this, Hitler mentioned Japan, saying that the country is no longer a member of the League of Nations, so how can it retain the Pacific mandated islands? The Daily Mail reports that Hitler, during the talks, confirmed to Simon that the German air force is now superior in number to the British air force. (29th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) News from London indicates that the British Cabinet is about to propose that after the Anglo-French-Italian conference in Stresa, an international conference of European countries be convened. Those around Lord Privy Seal Eden believe this should be treated with reservation. A close associate of Eden recently told this agency's reporter, "Everything will depend on the information we receive. Our trip is to consult various opinions and gather suggestions to provide research material for the British government, so that we may know whether a general agreement is possible within a defined scope. The British generally advocate the establishment of a security pact and have no intention of rejecting Germany. However, if Germany continues to reject it herself, or if she removes the essence of the pact while retaining its shell, it will be impossible to avoid responsibility. This is because one must choose between establishing security with effective laws or departing from the path of security and waiting for war to break out." (29th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The leader of the German Labor Service, Mr. Hierl, gave a speech in Leipzig today, foreshadowing the imminent implementation of compulsory labor service to assist compulsory military service. Mr. Hierl said that unified compulsory labor service can create a new type of worker, consolidate the conscript army, eliminate class differences, promote national affairs, and ensure an abundant food supply. (28th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Leipzig: The German Workers' Vanguard recently held a conference here. Mr. Hierl, the leader of the German Labor Front, made an important declaration at the conference today, stating that Germany's reintroduction of conscription and the needs and purposes of national labor service are in no way contradictory or restrictive. Mr. Hierl further stated that foreign misinterpretations of German national labor service as a substitute for military service are a distortion, because military service and labor service are completely different and cannot be substituted for each other. The duty of the national defense force is to defend the borders from attack, while labor service is the practical application of national socialism, guaranteeing that national sentiment will no longer be divided by class struggle. Mr. Hierl solemnly declared at the end, "In the future, national labor service should be implemented before military service. Anyone who wishes to earn the honor of a soldier must first prove their national value with honorable service in the labor corps. This principle is especially important for the leaders of the national defense force, regardless of their rank, and they must receive national socialist training in the labor corps. Therefore, in the future, German citizens, after receiving dual training in labor service and military service, will become new citizens completely immersed in national socialism, and the future of the country will rest on their shoulders. Therefore, the premise of the nation's future and the supreme law are all embodied in the words 'serving the country.'" (28th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to responsible sources, the United States is almost completely indifferent to Germany's demand for a navy of 400,000 tons. Since the failure of the Anglo-Japanese-American London Naval Talks at the end of last year, Britain has proposed to hold new talks on a broader basis in the hope of establishing an international agreement to replace the Washington Naval Treaty, and has advocated that secondary naval powers such as Germany participate in the talks. At that time, the U.S. government had already expressed that it had no objections, because the U.S. considers maintaining the 5:5:3 ratio to be the most important issue, and is not very concerned about whether or not secondary European countries expand their navies.

<p>Vienna: The Attorney General spoke in the Austrian Lower House today about the issue of compulsory military service in Austria, saying that a law to reintroduce compulsory military service is currently under discussion, but nothing can be done unless the Austrian people demand the implementation of compulsory military service by a majority. When British Foreign Secretary Simon recently answered questions from members of parliament in the Lower House, he said that he was unaware of Austria's proposal to implement compulsory military service, and had not heard of any documents on this matter between the League of Nations and Austria.

<p>Warsaw: Relations between Poland and Germany have been quite tense recently. The reason is that the authorities in German Silesia have taken unfavorable measures against the Polish middle school established by Poles in Beuthen. Therefore, the Upper Silesian Provincial Council passed a proposal by government members to issue a declaration protesting this move. The Polish Western Union held a meeting in Katowice to protest, and the German consulate in the city had to be protected by the police to avoid incidents. In addition, the Polish newspapers have published lengthy commentaries on this matter, which is particularly noteworthy. The Polish Commissioner to Danzig has also made representations to the Danzig Senate, saying that the Danzig Free City National Socialist Party often engages in illegal activities during elections and should be suppressed. It can be seen from this that there have been many disputes in German-Polish relations recently. (28th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Warsaw: After Prime Minister Kozłowski resigned, Colonel Sławek, the leader of the Congressional Government Party, succeeded him as Prime Minister. All cabinet members remain in their positions. In Poland, it is customary for the cabinet to change once a year. This does not change the general policy of Poland.

<p>Brussels – The Belgian Parliament convened today to hear the new cabinet announce its major policies. The chamber was packed, and the audience listened intently, displaying unprecedented tension. The new Prime Minister, Théophile de Jongh, declared that the government had decided to temporarily abandon the gold standard and had also decided to recognize Soviet Russia. The devaluation of the Belgian franc would officially take effect on Sunday, March 31, with a maximum devaluation of 30%. As for the recognition of the Soviet Russian government, no date was announced, but given the instability in Europe, Belgium's formal resumption of relations with Soviet Russia would be implemented as soon as possible. Various parties were quite satisfied with Prime Minister de Jongh's declaration. Supporters of the government's policies in Parliament accounted for a majority of 40 to 50. The Prime Minister indicated informally that the purchase of 2,000,000,000 francs' worth of gold in the past two months, coupled with large withdrawals of gold from banks, had contributed to the financial panic. The Prime Minister also announced that the redemption of Belgian banknotes for gold would also be temporarily suspended. After an international financial agreement is established in the future, efforts would be made to restore the gold standard. He also stated that Belgium would strive to facilitate this international agreement. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Brussels – Belgium has decided to devalue the Belgian franc. The government formed by former Vice Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, Théophile de Jongh, announced today that Belgium would still adhere to the gold standard but would reduce the value of its currency. The extent of the reduction would be limited to 30%. The gold reserves of the National Bank of Belgium would be temporarily revalued based on a standard that reduces the currency value by 25% compared to its current value. This morning, the Belgian cabinet read a proclamation to the Chamber of Representatives regarding this matter, stating that the government acknowledged that it was impossible to protect the Belgian franc at the previously set standard. Therefore, the exchange rate of the Belgian franc must be revised. The obligation of the National Bank to pay on demand, as stipulated in the 1926 regulations, would be temporarily suspended. It was also stated that the Belgian cabinet intends to use its full strength to promote an international mechanism that can restabilize the world's major currencies in terms of gold. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Brussels – After the new Prime Minister, Théophile de Jongh, took office, it was heard that he had formulated the cabinet's administrative guidelines and would soon submit them to Parliament. The outline is divided into nine items as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Devalue the Belgian currency by 25% to maintain a comparable exchange rate with the British pound.</p>
<p>(2) Establish an exchange stabilization fund.</p>
<p>(3) Launch public works projects to relieve unemployment and promote trade.</p>
<p>(4) The National Bank will control other banks; all enterprises must first prove their foundation is solid before they can be granted loans by the National Bank.</p>
<p>(5) Appropriately reduce certain tariffs to lower prices.</p>
<p>(6) Establish a 40-hour work week.</p>
<p>(7) Convene an international conference to stabilize the currencies of various countries.</p>
<p>(8) Restore diplomatic relations with Russia.</p>
<p>(9) The Chamber of Representatives will adjourn for one year. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) The Belgian government's order for the stock exchange to close for three days is seen here as a precursor to the country's devaluation of its currency. As a result, the Belgian currency has begun to depreciate in foreign markets. The Belgian currency against the British exchange rate fell today from 271.75 Belgian francs (equivalent to one pound) to 24 francs, before recovering to 23 francs at the close. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The government has ordered all stock exchanges to close and reopen on Monday. The country is filled with financial panic today, and people generally believe that the value of currency is about to decline, and Belgium will completely abandon the gold standard. The degree of currency devaluation will probably be between 28% and 33%. Those who own physical assets are doing everything possible to protect themselves today, frantically buying property such as houses, jewelry, and clothing, etc. Therefore, the nation's shops are extremely crowded all day long. Leaders of several political parties held small group meetings today and decided that they would vote for a vote of confidence if the new government of Prime Minister Théophile de Jongh can clearly explain its monetary policy plans. However, the cabinet's declaration in Parliament tomorrow will likely only briefly outline the main points of the government's plan. It is learned that de Jongh will request the privilege of managing the currency without the approval of the House of Representatives for a certain period. If so, after the currency devaluation, the government will have the freedom to deal with matters during the initial dangerous period. However, according to the Associated Press, the Congress will continue to meet before formally accepting or rejecting the government's plan. As for the rumors that the new government is about to devalue the currency, the general public believed that it was inevitable this morning. At 10:15 AM, the government ordered the closure of stock exchanges across the country. Although official sources cautiously stated that this move was intended to prevent speculation and did not indicate any panic, non-official sources claimed that after the closure, the government could calmly design a plan to deal with unforeseen circumstances. The general public is paying close attention to the opening of Parliament tomorrow to hear the government's announcement of its major policies, because the new Prime Minister de Jongh has always advocated currency management policies. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Belgian currency fell, those who advocate the French franc gold standard have not changed their attitudes, but people in the business community are gradually advocating lowering the currency value. France's tariff barriers can make exchange rate changes ineffective, so even if the Belgian franc depreciates, the French franc may still not be subject to economic repercussions. However, bankers fear that people will be motivated by profit, sell French government bonds, and invest their idle funds in foreign securities. If so, it will withdraw funds from banks and cause currency inflation, because banks do not have sufficient guarantees for their debts to depositors. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(New York) The closure of the Belgian stock exchange, which is a prelude to the devaluation of the Belgian currency, did not disrupt the New York financial market, because this development in Belgium was not entirely unexpected. However, after the devaluation of the Belgian currency, what impact will other gold currencies face? This is a matter of much speculation. Some believe that if the gold bloc collapses, the path to the rapid stabilization of currencies in all aspects will be opened up as a result, which will benefit the whole world. Some people regard the method of transferring gold from Paris to New York as the final act of the gold currency farce, but whether Paris actually has gold transported to the United States will depend on the latest developments in Belgium. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British Exchange Control has shipped gold worth 18 million pounds from London to Paris to pay for the forward pounds purchased when the pound exchange rate was 71 francs, because the British authorities did not have enough francs. This shipment of gold has nothing to do with other gold flows. The demand for US dollars in Paris is increasing due to commercial needs and increased tension. Therefore, gold is continuously flowing into New York. The French financial situation now depends on whether the Netherlands and Switzerland can continue to ship out gold to meet the withdrawal of foreign funds. If these two countries reduce or stop the export of gold, the French authorities will have to find ways to curb the outflow of gold. According to general opinion, the recent political developments in Europe may make the French authorities even more reluctant to lose a large amount of gold. It is rumored that Belgian Prime Minister Théophile de Jongh will propose lowering the value of the Belgian currency to make it 26 Belgian francs to one British gold pound, in other words, devaluing the Belgian franc by 28%. It is generally expected that Belgium will issue 4% Belgian government bonds in London in order to replace domestic Belgian government bonds. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Brussels – The Belgian cabinet announced in Parliament that it would allow the National Bank to temporarily suspend the payment of gold and declared that it would organize a special agency to supervise the credit policy and exchange rates set by the cabinet. This temporary measure will be effective from February 31st. Belgium temporarily leaves the gold standard, but the government still intends to restore the gold standard in the future. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, Belgian Prime Minister Théophile de Jongh requested Parliament to authorize (1) to reduce the value of the Belgian currency, limited to 30%; (2) to temporarily restrict payments before an international agreement on currency policy is reached. The Belgian Prime Minister proposed to first reduce the currency value by 25%. This is the first break in the gold bloc. The devaluation of the Belgian currency will affect certain Belgian exports to the UK. Belgium has always exported large quantities of steel, but since the pound's value fell, the number of these goods imported into the UK has been greatly reduced. Belgium also manufactures large quantities of cement bricks, and in the future, due to the lower price of the Belgian currency, it will compete with the UK within the UK and overseas. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) London was not shocked after hearing the Belgian decision to lower the currency value, but is waiting for news of any reactions from other gold bloc countries. Financial circles here said that the path adopted by the Belgian cabinet is exactly the same as that previously adopted by President Roosevelt. The Belgian Prime Minister Théophile de Jongh followed President Roosevelt's example and requested Congress to allow him to have the power to devalue to the highest degree without being bound by the final reduced number himself. This is to reserve a powerful tool for future negotiations on stabilizing currency prices. Théophile de Jongh has always admired President Roosevelt and is confident that he can follow in Roosevelt's footsteps and use the paper surplus obtained from revaluing gold reserves to fund the equalization fund. Demand for the British pound in Europe has been quite strong recently. Today's actions by Belgium have made the demand for the British pound even stronger, but the London Stock Exchange has not been affected in any way. People in Paris pointed out that this move by Belgium is a blood transfusion from the gold bloc to the British pound bloc and are now watching whether domestic prices in Belgium can remain stable, as the theory promoted by those in France who advocate for currency devaluation suggests. If its price stability is consistent with this theory, it is predicted that the calls for lowering currency value in France will be even higher than they are now. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Standing Opium Committee of the League of Nations recently announced that Costa Rica and Ecuador in Central America have recently joined the 1925 Geneva Convention on Drug Control. Therefore, the total number of countries that have joined the convention is fifty-two. Furthermore, since the Greek government ratified the Drug Control Convention in 1931, the total number of countries that have ratified the convention is forty-nine. Regarding the quarterly import and export statistics of narcotics, the Standing Opium Committee recently pointed out that more detailed statistical reports must be obtained first. Some countries in Central and South America do not regularly submit statistical reports to the committee, and they should be requested to submit them in the future. As for the various statistical reports on the achievements obtained during the first year (i.e., 1931) of the implementation of the Drug Control Convention sent by the Secretariat of the League of Nations, the committee has already filed them for the record. It is estimated that the committee handled a total of 29 cases of negotiations to prohibit the export of narcotics in certain countries this year, and the committee considered that more than 100 cases of small amounts of narcotics should not be subject to embargo.

<h3 id="e79">1934 Soviet Union's Foreign Trade (German Correspondence) <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan, the development of industry in the Soviet Union has become a matter of global astonishment.  Especially the figures for foreign trade in 1934 fully demonstrate the Soviet Union's continuous advancement and the gradual possibility of becoming a "self-sufficient" nation.  Stalin said some time ago that as a result of the Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union has changed from a timber country to a steel country. This is not an exaggeration, because the Soviet Union is now in a situation where the bitter days are over and the sweet days have begun.</p>
<p>Years ago, when the Five-Year Plan was mentioned, European newspapers described it with a mocking attitude, ridiculing it as "fantasy".  But in recent years, this atmosphere has gradually disappeared and turned into close attention.  Even the German newspapers in the past two years, due to the fundamental conflict between National Socialism and Communism, rarely published articles on the current situation in the Soviet Union.  However, recently they have changed their direction, and articles discussing the Soviet Union have often been seen in newspapers. It can be seen that in recent years, the progress of the Soviet Union has been deeply noticed by both enemies and friends.</p>
<p>From January to October 1934, the total amount of Soviet Union's foreign trade in ten months was 533.6 million rubles. Similarly, in the ten months of 1933, the total amount was 701.5 million rubles. In the ten months of 1932, the total amount even reached 1,058.6 million rubles. According to this figure, from 1932 to 1934, the total foreign trade of the Soviet Union has almost halved in two years. If it were in a capitalist country, it would naturally be the result of being affected by the global economic panic and a sign of decline. However, the Soviet Union is a socialist country. The purpose of foreign trade is to seek more elements for the development of domestic industry, which is fundamentally different from capitalist countries. Therefore, this trend can also prove that the foundation of the Soviet Union's domestic industry is gradually solidifying, and the need for foreign goods can be gradually reduced.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the sharp decrease in Soviet Union's foreign trade is especially in terms of imports. In the ten months of 1934, the total imports were only 189.8 million rubles, compared with 291.2 million rubles in 1933, and even reached 597.1 million rubles in 1932. This means that in two years, the total amount of Soviet Union's imports has almost decreased by two-thirds. Similarly, it clearly proves that in the past two years, the Soviet Union's domestic industrial products have largely replaced foreign goods. As for the export part, in the ten months of 1934, the total amount was 343.8 million rubles, compared with 410.2 million rubles in 1933, and 461.4 million rubles in 1932. Although the total amount of Soviet Union's exports has decreased by 117.6 million rubles in the past two years, compared with the ratio of the decrease in total imports, it will be considered a small amount. On the other hand, in 1934, the export of silver and other precious metals was not included in the statistical table. According to the statistics of 1933, silver and other items accounted for 32.5 million rubles in the export category. Therefore, on the whole, the total amount of Soviet Union's exports in 1934 was not actually reduced by much.</p>
<p>In terms of foreign trade, the Soviet Union has become a country with a trade surplus in the past two years. In 1934, the trade surplus was 154 million rubles, and in 1933, the trade surplus was 119 million rubles. On the contrary, in 1932, the Soviet Union's trade deficit still accounted for 135.7 million rubles. Due to the trade surplus in the past two years and the large increase in gold production in the Soviet Union in recent years, not only can the foreign debts incurred by the Five-Year Plan be repaid on schedule, but also the price of the ruble in the international market is rising day by day. Up to this point, the difficult problem of Soviet Union's foreign trade has been completely resolved. At present, when ordering goods from other countries, the Soviet Union has put forward more favorable requirements regarding payment terms than ever before.</p>
<p>Although there have not been many changes in the Soviet Union's exports in 1934 in general, the significance is very different from the past. For example, a part of fully manufactured industrial products has been newly added to the exported goods. Although the number is not large, in the ten months of 1934, the total export of machinery (excluding agricultural machinery) was 1.4 million rubles, steel was 1.3 million rubles, steel products were 2.6 million rubles, and artificial fertilizers were 4.8 million rubles. This number is certainly not large, but it is enough to prove that the Soviet Union has gradually changed from an agricultural country to an industrial country. Naturally, the most important export product of the Soviet Union in the ten months of 1934 was still timber, with a total of 81.67 million rubles, an increase of about 13 million rubles compared with the export amount in the same period in 1933. The second was crude oil, with a total of 48.2 million rubles, a decrease of more than 16 million rubles compared with the same period in 1933. The third was tobacco, with a total of 28.96 million rubles, a decrease of about 8 million rubles compared with 1933. In addition, the total amount of grain was 18.28 million rubles, a decrease of more than 14 million rubles compared with 1933. The total amount of cotton was 18.82 million rubles, a decrease of about 7.5 million rubles compared with 1933. The total amount of flax was 16.02 million rubles, an increase of about 1.5 million rubles compared with 1933. The total amount of flour was 5.1 million rubles, an increase of about 2 million rubles compared with 1933. The total amount of cheese, etc. was 7.9 million rubles, a decrease of about 2 million rubles compared with 1933. This is the general overview of Soviet Union's export goods.</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union's import sector, as mentioned above, it has also decreased by about 36% compared with 1933. The reason for this is naturally because in the early stage of the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan in the Soviet Union, it had to purchase foreign industrial machinery in large quantities, so the total amount of imports was particularly large. By 1934, on the one hand, domestic industry gradually developed, and the machines produced in the country were sufficient to meet part of the domestic demand. On the other hand, the profound impact of the global economic panic still existed, and exports could not be developed as much as possible. Therefore, it was only possible to restrict the import sector to stabilize the market price of the Russian currency in the world market. This flexible foreign trade system has given the Soviet Union's economy an important guarantee. In the ten months of 1934, the total amount of machinery imported from foreign countries (excluding agricultural machinery) was 33.27 million rubles, while in the same period in 1933 it was 100.89 million rubles, and in 1932 it even reached 240.14 million rubles. The total amount of imported electrical appliances was 7.16 million rubles, 17.77 million rubles in 1933, and even 58.09 million rubles in 1932. The total amount of steel was 23.78 million rubles, which was still 40.8 million rubles in 1933. The total amount of other metals was 18.62 million rubles, which was 18.39 million rubles in 1933. The total amount of copper and iron products was 13.98 million rubles. In addition, the import amount of tea was 5.9 million rubles, livestock was 8.6 million rubles, tobacco was 5.7 million rubles, wool was 9.1 million rubles, etc.</p>
<p>As for the trade between the Soviet Union and other countries, in terms of country, the United Kingdom ranked first in terms of imports in 1934, accounting for 36.2 million rubles. In the same period in 1933, the United Kingdom's exports to the Soviet Union were only 9.3 million rubles. The second was Germany, accounting for 25.4 million rubles. In 1933, Germany's exports to the Soviet Union reached 114 million rubles. The sudden decrease in the trade volume in 1934 was naturally due to political reasons. The third was the United States. After the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, there were great hopes for commerce, but the result was not as expected. In 1934, the United States' exports to the Soviet Union amounted to 16.1 million rubles, only 1 million rubles more than in the same period in 1933 before the resumption of diplomatic relations. However, the Soviet Union's exports to the United States were only 10.8 million rubles in 1934, a decrease of 1.3 million rubles compared with 1933. This business result led to the suspension of debt negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union recently, and the relations between the two countries have also tended to deteriorate. Originally, the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union was mostly out of political motives, but Americans value profit and seem to attach particular importance to economic interests. When we see the trade figures between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1934, it is not difficult to understand the changes in the recent diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>In short, judging from the Soviet Union's foreign trade in 1934, on the one hand, it shows that the domestic construction work has gradually reached a broad road, and it may be possible to catch up with the advanced industrial countries in Europe and the United States in the near future. On the other hand, precisely because of this, the conflict between the Soviet Union and other capitalist countries has become more acute, intensifying the attempt of various countries to jointly attack the Soviet Union. The European countries are preparing for war very urgently these days, and the scourge of war may break out at any time within a few years, and the Russian question is one of the most important fuse among them.

<h3 id="e80">Japan's Activities in the Theatre of War <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— (Japanese Correspondence)</p>
<p>The Ascendancy of the Restoration Movement and the Decline of Constitutional Politics</p>
<p>The high-sounding tones of good-neighborly diplomacy, amity with the United States, friendliness with the Soviet Union, cooperation with China, etc., are all sung loudly. Recently, the Chinese Eastern Railway has been successfully bought back. Judging from this situation, Japan's international diplomatic policy seems to be more inclined to peace. The Pacific Ocean can really be peaceful. Foreign Minister Hirota Koki's "moral diplomacy" should be worthy of its name. However, at the same time, we also see the active war preparations throughout Japan. The government-run military factories are working day and night, and all private factories that have a relatively close relationship with military supplies are making ten times the profit. Especially since February, major newspapers have invited generals from the army and navy who participated in the Russo-Japanese War to hold commemorative symposiums, extravagantly discussing the situation at the time of the war, elaborating on the war achievements, and encouraging the general public's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>The historical traces of war and peaceful diplomacy are juxtaposed, just as the Koishikawa Artillery Arsenal and the Tokyo Imperial University echo each other. The Tokyo Imperial University is where talents are cultivated, and scholarship and morality are lectured. The Koishikawa Artillery Arsenal, however, is continuously manufacturing tools for killing day and night, and the better the guns, the better. The idea is to kill more people, which is more in line with their original purpose. The entire political performance of Japan is also like this. More than 50 years have passed since the Meiji Restoration. Japan is a constitutional political country. The constitutional theory has been popular in schools for decades. The constitutional theory, which has never had a problem in the past, unexpectedly caused a great stir in this year's 67th Congress. Both the army and navy expressed their protest, and the spirit of the rule of law in parliamentary politics has obviously declined.</p>
<p>The decline of Japanese parliamentary politics is naturally also affected by the world's political relations. At the same time, the existing political parties have many undisguisable weaknesses. For example, the major bribery cases in the past have all involved key figures in the political parties, but this is not the most important reason. What deviates from the constitutional norm is the state of emergency—after the September 18th Incident, especially the May 15th Incident after Inukai's assassination—the military controlled the helm of the state of emergency. The higher the tune of the state of emergency, the greater the power of the military. The political parties simply have no room for activity. Everything has to listen to the guidance of the military. The military advocates taking the Emperor as the center, which is fundamentally different from the democratic thought of the parliament depending on the majority. Moreover, the established political parties, which are far away from the masses, bear the empty name of democracy and cannot get the support of the masses. Their decline is inevitable.</p>
<p>The middle class in Japan is very powerful, and its organizational strength is quite strong. Their beliefs are very solid, and their knowledge and ability have been trained to a considerable extent. They now constitute the center of gravity of Japanese society. These people are dissatisfied with the corruption of the upper class, dissatisfied with the political status quo, and especially dissatisfied with financial capital. Therefore, they support the military's policies and agree with everything the military does. The established political parties have lost the support of the masses and only have a false name.</p>
<p>"Peace" is an armed coat, a means for the military to borrow international diplomacy, and at the same time, it is also a trick for parliamentary politics and bureaucrats to cooperate. Let us take the example of military councillor Abe Nobuyuki's inspection of "Manchuria" on March 10 to prove the actual political trend in Japan. Originally, it was nothing unusual for Abe to go to the three northeastern provinces and comfort the troops in "Manchuria". What is noteworthy is that after Abe returned to Japan in April, Araki Sadao followed suit. (We all know that General Araki is the mastermind in the state of emergency and the leader of the young military officers.) His visit to "Manchuria" is by no means an ordinary tourist nature, and must contain major military and political implications. It is said that he will also go to North China to take a look. In May, the current Minister of the Army, Hayashi Senjuro, will follow in the footsteps of Abe and Araki to the four eastern provinces, also saying that he is inspecting and comforting the troops in "Manchuria". It is rare for the current Minister of the Army to go abroad to inspect in Japan, and it has a special meaning to go to North China and other places. The Japanese military strategist General Watanabe Jotaro (currently a military councillor) will go to the four northeastern provinces after Minister of the Army Hayashi Senjuro returns to China. The last person to go is General Matsui Iwane (a China expert in the army). On the surface, they all say that they are inspecting and comforting the troops. All the military councillors in the army have to go to "Manchuria" once. The missions they bear are roughly the same, and the internal meaning is equally important. In this period of decline of constitutional politics and the leap of military power, peace is probably placed under the military sword. (March 23rd in Tokyo)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Bandits Spring Up in the War Zone, Yutian's Illegal Militia Flees to Fengrun and Jixian, and Feng Shoupeng's Mutinous Troops are Defeated and Flee to Shunyi <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The security of the war zone is actually insufficient due to the limited number and weapons of the security teams. In addition, some security teams and special police were temporarily reorganized from the old troops of puppet army officers such as Li Jichun and Shi Yousan due to special relations. There were often incidents of colluding with bandits and illegal militias to oppress the local people, which led to the inability to eliminate the scattered bandits, resulting in the inability to maintain security. After the authorities and the Japanese side agreed on measures to clean up the war zone, the first step was to transfer and reorganize Sun Yuchen's security team in Yutian and Feng Shoupeng's special police team, and reorganize the illegal militia in Yutian. However, after Feng's troops were transferred, more than 300 people mutinied and became bandits, looting everywhere. The illegal militia under Wang Chengzhu also refused to be reorganized. At the same time, scattered bandits everywhere began to harass. Feng Shoupeng's mutinous troops once harassed Miyun. After being besieged by the security team, they crossed Huairou and Shunyi from Miyun County on the 24th and fled to Lisui Town. They were intercepted by the security team there and fled east again. After passing through Sanhe County, they fled to Yanjiao Town near Tongxian County, attempting to incite the former Sun Yuchen's security team, which had been transferred from Yutian to the area. Yesterday, they were blocked and suppressed by the security team, and most of them were defeated. The remaining 70 or so people formed a small group and fled back to Wanggezhuang in Shunyi County today (26th). The Shunyi County security team is currently besieging them. The authorities originally took a lenient attitude towards Wang Chengzhu's illegal militia in Ya Hongqiao, Yutian, and reorganized them. However, the militia refused to be reorganized, plotted against the authorities, secretly colluded with Feng Shoupeng's mutinous troops and bandits, and hired a Japanese man, Noda, as an advisor. The Jimei District Commissioner's Office sent personnel to inform them several times, but they always disobeyed. To prevent this from happening, the authorities sent the security team under Zhou Yuying, stationed in Yutian, to take surveillance actions in the Niugezhuang and Gaoqiao areas at dawn on the 24th. The troops took surveillance actions around Ya Hongqiao. The troops deployed defenses around Ya Hongqiao and attacked the security team. The two sides made contact at noon yesterday (25th). Zhou's troops, believing that the troops were resisting orders, bravely advanced and suppressed them. After five hours of fierce fighting, many bandits were killed. The bandits were unable to resist and retreated in all directions. That night, Zhou's troops occupied Ya Hongqiao. In this battle, four members of Zhou's security team were killed and more than a dozen were injured. The bandit troops originally had more than a thousand people. Now, in addition to those killed and scattered, most of them fled to Jingyu in Zunhua County this morning. Another group of about 300 people fled east, with the intention of fleeing to Fengrun. Zhou's troops are currently tracking and pursuing them, and have informed the security teams of Zunhua and Fengrun to intercept them. On the 24th, the bandits found in the second district of Jixian have been eliminated. Thirty-nine bandits were captured, and twenty-eight guns were seized. The bandit leader, Zhang Hanmin, was also arrested. The bandits were from the disbanded militia in Yutian, who had been in contact with Feng Shoupeng's troops, oppressing the local people. When Feng's troops were transferred and the militia was disbanded, they became bandits. A few days ago, more than 300 bandits fled to Zunhua from Ran County via Sheshentai. They were blocked and suppressed by the Zunhua security team and have now fled to Qian'an County. The Aoyu District security team is currently besieging them. This time, bandits have harassed various places in the war zone. There are about 2,000 people, and they have fled to six or seven counties. The bandit troops are fully armed and have weapons such as machine guns. The security teams are too small in number, the defense area is vast, and the military strength is extremely weak. In addition, the weapons are limited, making it difficult to suppress them. When Feng Shoupeng's mutinous troops fled to Miyun a few days ago, they consulted with the Japanese army in the Gubeikou area and carried light machine guns to suppress the bandits. As a result, they were only allowed to carry six machine guns, and they could only be used when necessary. The authorities believe that the bandits are springing up and causing trouble, and it is not enough to secure the region without eliminating them. Yin Rugeng, the administrative commissioner of the Jimei District, went to Tianjin from Ping a few days ago to discuss suppression measures with the provincial government and to negotiate everything with the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters and the Shanhaiguan Special Service Agency Chief Iga. This morning, Yin, accompanied by Iga and the staff officer Omoki of the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin, went to Tangshan from Tianjin and then to Yutian to handle the suppression of bandits and the reorganization of the militia. After completing his official duties in Yutian, he will go to the Yanjiao area to inspect the situation after the transfer of the security team. (March 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Guantai Closure Stops Work, Actively Preparing Materials, Hoping for Closure in Two Months <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Since the central government ordered the change of the agency in charge of the Guantai project and stopped waiting for materials, the current work relief group in charge has appointed special commissioners for transportation, material purchase, accounting, affairs, material factory, and engineering office, and is stepping up preparations for various materials and various equipment. It is estimated that more than 200 ships have been requisitioned from Wuzhi, Sishui, Guangwu, Gongxian, and Kaifeng, and dozens more from Puyang and Changtan have been telegraphed to be escorted to Guan immediately. Shandong is also requisitioning at the same time. For stone transportation, Longhai and Pinghan have dispatched vehicles, which will start transporting on the 25th and 26th respectively. The Jinpu Railway has also specially dispatched three trains to assist in the handling. One train will depart from Heshangqiao Station on the Pinghan Railway, and the other from Xuzhou Station on the Longhai Railway, transporting large quantities of stone from Xingshan and Dahu Mountain, respectively, to Lanfeng Station, where they will be transferred by rail trucks. Four hundred extra carts will be hired and transported in shifts day and night, and special transport ships will be prepared on the opposite bank of Guantai to be loaded as they arrive and delivered directly to the Guantai mouth. It is said that a total of 7,000 city squares of stone have been ordered, which is about 30,000 cubic meters. However, the three-way transportation is calculated on the basis of three trains arriving at Lanfeng Station every day, and it will still be difficult to collect them all in about 20 days. In addition, 2,000 city squares of old and new stone materials stored by the Pinggong Institute of the Yu River Affairs Bureau will be borrowed. A few million catties of kaoliang materials have been purchased on behalf of the Zheng County Commissioner's Office, and one million catties have been purchased in Kaifeng, and tens of thousands of catties have been shipped. Forty thousand catties have also been settled in Chenliu, and they are all being shipped. Three million catties of willow branches have been settled in Liuyuankou and Chenqiaokou in Kaifeng. Hemp bags, lead wire, iron anchors, etc. have all been purchased and loaded in Shanghai and will arrive in Lanfeng in batches starting today (27th). More than 200,000 catties of hemp have been purchased and transported, and personnel were also sent to Hankou last night to purchase a large quantity of linen, which is scheduled to be shipped here within a few days. Before the arrival of large quantities of materials, special attention will be paid to the defense work of the projects that have been done. According to Kong Xiangrong, we will take the opportunity to advance the closure after the manpower and materials are collected, and it is expected that the closure will be completed in two months.

<h3 id="e83">Fujian Army Captures Zhao'an Bandit Stronghold; Meizhou is an Important Nest of Pirates and a Key Area for Planting Opium <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Zhao'an is remotely located on the edge of southern Fujian, with many coastal mountains. It borders Raoping in eastern Guangdong. For more than a decade, it has often been an area where pirates appear. Meizhou Township, in particular, is a major den of pirates. Its range of looting extends as far as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Jiangxi, Raoping, Chenghai, Shantou, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. The magnitude of its power can be imagined. The terrain of Meizhou is located in the southwest of Zhao'an, with mountains behind and the sea in front. Rivers run through it, and the harbors are curved and intricate, with grotesque rocks standing out and dangerous shapes. The population of the entire township is about 30,000, and there are more than 10,000 people in the surrounding 300-odd villages, large and small. Because they are oppressed by bandits and coerced, they are driven to engage in a life of robbery all day long, committing crimes. Fathers pass it on to their sons, almost considering it a legitimate profession.</p>
<p>In addition to being forced to engage in robbery, the people of Meizhou and the surrounding 300-odd villages also engage in opium cultivation as their main occupation. The locals never ask about farming throughout the year, only wishing for a good harvest of poppies. Opium exports reach 200,000 to 300,000 taels to as much as 500,000 to 600,000 taels per month. Each tael is worth two to three yuan. Considering only the income from opium cultivation each year, it reaches more than ten million yuan, not counting the proceeds from robbery. The most opium is shipped to Shanghai and Southeast Asia, followed by Chaozhou and Xiamen. The opium shipped to Chaozhou is mostly smuggled from Zhao'an into Rao, and then distributed to various places, thus avoiding the collection of special taxes. Therefore, its price is cheaper than opium shipped from other places. Years ago, the Chao-Mei Anti-Opium Bureau specially set up a special investigation team to investigate and crack down on tax-evading Meizhou opium. Since then, Meizhou opium shipped to Chaozhou is willing to pay taxes. However, because Chaozhou needs a lot of opium, the shipment of Meizhou opium to Chaozhou does not decrease because of taxation. In Meizhou, the four major companies are the giants in operating opium, followed by the six shareholders. Those who boast of wealth often claim to have property of a certain number of *dong* (冬, *dong* is a container for storing opium, shaped like a large vat, which can hold sixteen *dan* of opium, called one *dong*). As for the defense of bandit dens, the Meizhou pirates are divided into six major gangs, plus more than a dozen small gangs. The six major gangs are the most powerful and especially rampant. Each major gang has from one thousand to three thousand people, and the small gangs also have hundreds of people. They divide into land and sea routes to carry out robbery. Every day, they seize dozens of ransom tickets and rob more than ten ships, all imprisoned in the township to await ransom. The gangs often compete with each other because of the relationship between tickets and stolen goods. The entire township is divided into three major defense lines. The bandit nests of each gang and the places where the ransom tickets are imprisoned are the inner defense line. Various places in the township are the second defense line. Anyone who discovers a ransom ticket escaping, regardless of which gang or person, can kill it on the spot. The outside of the township and the harbor are the first defense line to prevent the army from encircling and suppressing them and attacks from other villages. There are many underground camp caves in the mountains, which are connected by underground tunnels dug from the township. In addition, ditches are dug in important places on the land route into the township. Furthermore, mountain torrents are gathered and stored on the mountains, and diverted into pits and ditches. In case of emergency, the mountain torrents are immediately released to block traffic, so as to defend against foreign invaders. Because of the meticulous defense, the Meizhou bandits have been rampant for more than ten years, and the government troops have never been able to do anything about it.</p>
<p>This time, Fujian Province is strictly enforcing the opium ban and forcibly eradicating opium seedlings. The Meizhou bandits regard opium as their lifeline and strive to avoid the strict ban. At first, they entrusted Mr. Zhang, a neighbor who had served as a division commander, with 300,000 yuan to lobby, but Zhang refused. The Meizhou tyrants then used Zhang's village as a threat. Zhang had no choice but to instruct his wife to lobby, but it was too late, and the government did not approve it. The people of Meizhou then advocated resisting the inspection and prohibition. The defense army stationed in Yunxiao Zhao'an, under the order of the Zhangzhou Pacification Office, led a regiment to Meizhou to eradicate opium. Each district of Meizhou then joined forces to resist, and released mountain torrents into the ditches, submerging the roads. Later, reinforcements used ships to provide support. After seven days of fierce fighting, the bandits were defeated and all escaped to the back mountains through underground tunnels. Only dozens of people were captured, and more than 100 ransom tickets were rescued. More than 100 ransom tickets were drowned and starved to death by the water. After the township was broken, the army implemented a clean-up, and seized more than 8 million taels of opium, including those hidden for more than ten years, all of which were burned. Now the township is garrisoned by the army, and most of the villagers have fled outside and dare not return to their hometown. Some of them have joined gangs and gone up the mountain to become bandits. From now on, the residents and travelers in the area along the border of Guangdong and Fujian should be able to obtain safety. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Northern Anhui Tea Industry Business Tax—Bureau Established Three Days Before Qingming Festival to Handle Matters <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anhui is a tea-producing province, and tea taxes have always been a reliable source of income. In recent years, the Department of Finance has adopted a contractor system. Every year at the end of the lunar year, it relies on the guarantee deposits of tea tax contractors to embellish the accounts. However, last year, the counties of Huizhou suffered from the intrusion of Jiangxi bandits, and the order was disturbed. Most of those who had bid for tea taxes hesitated. Although the counties in northern Anhui are safer than those in southern Anhui, the tax amount is slightly lower. As a result, the Department of Finance changed to a commissioned system, and only yesterday (26th) did it officially announce the directors of the tea industry business tax bureaus in the counties of northern and southern Anhui. Yang Mianzhong, the director of the Department of Finance, specially convened the directors of the commissioned bureaus yesterday afternoon to instruct them on everything, and urged them to prepare to depart quickly and establish bureaus to collect taxes three days before the Qingming Festival. It is also heard that the Department of Finance plans to set up four inspection bureaus at key locations in each bureau to specialize in inspecting the tax collection situation of each bureau. The candidates for the directors of each bureau who have been announced are: Jia Mingjiu in Zhidong, Xu Tao in Xiuyi, Zhang Shouquan in Maotan Factory, Zhu Tianxiu in Qimen, Yao Dapeng in Jingtai, Zhu Baoru in Mabou and Jianlianghekou, Zhao Yunchang in Huoshan and Jianguanjiabu, Xu Zhiqin in Shexian, Guang Sipu in Xuanlang, Huang Zichun in Balitan, Sun Daishi in Tongshi, and Zhao Tongfang in Qilihe.

<p>A male floating corpse, about forty years old, was discovered in the river north of Xiuye Bridge in the city this morning. He was wearing a gray cotton robe, lined with a yuan-colored cotton jacket, gray cotton pants, and rubber shoes. It is not known where the corpse came from. The town police reported to the county court prosecutor's office, and officials went to the scene for an examination. It was determined that there were no injuries. Because there were no family members to claim it, the town police were ordered to prepare a coffin and wait for a public announcement to claim it.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Wuxi Appeals for Exemption from Silk Cocoon Tax <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The silk factory trade association of this county believes that factory silk in our country is a major export. In recent years, affected by the devaluation and dumping of Japanese silk, the silk market has plummeted, and exports have been sharply reduced. Compared with the heyday, it only accounts for 15%. Xidi has always been a sericulture production area. In recent years, due to the tragic decline in the silk market, the silk factories have suffered huge losses, so the price of cocoons has been lowered, and farmers have no profit in raising silkworms. They have all turned mulberry fields into rice fields, resulting in a reduction in the output of dried cocoons in Xidi. The raw materials needed by various factories have to be purchased from provinces such as Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, and Hubei and transported to Xixiao for silk reeling. However, in places where customs are set up in various provinces, they often forcibly collect silk scraps or cocoon shell taxes on dried cocoons. At this critical moment for the survival of the silk industry, illegal taxation by the customs increases the cost of factory silk. If it is not stopped immediately, it will inevitably lead to the complete bankruptcy of silk factories across the country. Therefore, yesterday, they specially presented a report to the Ministry of Finance, requesting permission to instruct the competent authorities of relevant provinces and various customs to investigate and clarify that all donations and taxes involving silk cocoons should be exempted. At the same time, they also submitted reports to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways, requesting that the Beijing-Shanghai, Hangzhou-Tianjin-Pukou, Ping-Han, Long-Hai, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Administrations, as well as the China Merchants Bureau's shipping bureaus, be instructed to give preferential treatment to the freight of dry cocoons by halving the cost, in order to reduce costs.</p>

<p>The Lianghuai Yangyun Shi San Merchants, due to the case of providing work relief in the disaster areas in the eighth and ninth counties, had a proposal to subsidize loan prices by the salt industry. A joint meeting was held at the Si'an Guild Hall yesterday, and County Magistrate Ma also attended. As a result, everyone was willing to contribute 10,000 yuan, but it was difficult to raise cash at one time. It was decided to send a letter to the county government to forward a telegram to Director Miao and Director Jin, requesting the appropriation of 10,000 yuan from the public welfare charitable donations deducted and stored by the merchants, so as to provide relief. The donation was originally used for charitable fundraising in preparation for the salt industry. After the transportation office reorganized, it was no longer possible to freely use it. This time, purchasing loans to relieve disaster victims and creating blessings for the local area should be approved.</p>

<p>The financial circles of Yangzhou have always relied on the funds of the salt circles for turnover to maintain the market. Since the order to pay the salt guide donations along with the salt tax directly to the Central Bank, the Yangzhou market has been affected.

<h3 id="e97">All Circles in Shanghai Held Memorial Meeting for Huanghuagang Martyrs Yesterday; More Than 500 People Attended at the Folk Education Center; All Agencies and Schools Had Holidays and Flew Flags at Half-Mast <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the Huanghuagang Martyrs Revolution. At 9:00 a.m., all circles in Shanghai held a memorial meeting at the Folk Education Center. Jiang Hao, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, reported on the course and significance of the March 29th Revolution. Zhu Xuefan also gave a speech. All agencies and schools in the city had a holiday for one day, and flags were flown at half-mast everywhere to express condolences. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Jiang Hao of the Municipal Party Committee, Chen Kecheng of the Municipal Government, Huang Zaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, Yu Zhenhui of the Municipal Agricultural Association, Zhu Xuefan of the General Labor Union, Ke Ganchen of the South Municipal Council, Luo Weixiong of the Garrison Command (the above are the presidium), Gao Wuhe of the Shanghai First Special Zone Court, Yao Changjiong of the Municipal Education Bureau, Xie Shouquan of the Defense Committee, Chen Songchun of the Folk Education Center, Dong Chongshan of the Second Special Zone Court, Dai Baojun of the International Telecommunications Bureau, Wang Zongjian of the Jianghai Customs, Hu Tianseng of the New Movement Promotion Association, Ren Bin of the Tooth and Bone Industry Union, Yu Yaoqiu of the South Goods Industry Union, and more than 500 representatives of primary and secondary schools such as Zhengfeng Minli Jianguo Shangwen.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony was performed as usual, Chairman Jiang Hao first gave a report, saying: Today, all circles in Shanghai are holding a memorial for the Huanghuagang Martyrs Revolution. This is a necessary stage in the revolutionary process. At that time, the revolutionary team led by the Premier occasionally failed in revolutionary actions and were sincerely terrified. However, the Premier still adhered to the spirit of perseverance and began to plan this great revolutionary action. At that time, the Premier and the revolutionary pioneers discussed launching in Guangzhou and seizing the southwest as a base for the revolution, and decided to take responsibility for carrying it out separately. The Premier went overseas to raise funds. Overseas comrades were happy to follow. At one time, they raised about 200,000 yuan. Huang Keqiang planned the military launch in Hong Kong. At first, progress was slow due to financial difficulties. Later, the Premier raised a large sum of money, and immediately purchased weapons and sent comrades to secretly infiltrate Guangzhou. At that time, the Qing government was already aware of this, so it was heavily guarded. However, the comrades still spared no effort and painstakingly made active arrangements in Guangzhou. In the meantime, I don't know how many twists and turns were taken. On March 29, they used white cloth wrapped around their arms as a signal and attacked in three routes. Huang Keqiang personally led his comrades to attack the Governor's Office, but all three routes temporarily failed due to the disparity in numbers. After the investigation, 72 revolutionary martyrs were sacrificed in this disaster. Although the event was unsuccessful, the righteousness of their uprising and the heroism of their death were enough to move the gods and frighten the enemy. Later, the comrades buried the seventy-two martyrs in Huanghuagang, hence the name. In this revolutionary process, we deeply feel that the success of the revolution is a curved line and must go through many hardships before it can be achieved. However, we must go to it with a spirit of great fearlessness. Today, China's national fortune is still difficult. We should follow the spirit of the martyrs and build the Chinese nation. Now the central government is working hard on unification and construction to enrich national power. If we can be united from top to bottom, the rejuvenation is bound to be promising.</p>
<p>Main Points of the Speech</p>
<p>Then, Zhu Xuefan gave a speech, saying that the Battle of Huanghuagang was entirely for the purpose of equality for the Chinese nation, equality of civil rights, and equality of economy. The spirit of struggle and sacrifice of the martyrs is truly admirable. Today, China is still in a dangerous period. In the future, we should (1) gather China's strength to save the nation, save the masses, and save the country; (2) save the country and save the people should start from ourselves. As the ancients said, everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country. I hope to encourage each other.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans</p>
<p>(1) Inherit the spirit of sacrifice and struggle of the revolutionary martyrs; (2) Unite the comrades of the party; (3) Complete the unfinished legacy of the revolutionary martyrs; (4) Support peaceful unification; (5) Support the revolutionary leader; (6) Strive for production and construction; (7) Eliminate the remnant bandits; (8) The spirit of the revolutionary martyrs will never die; (9) Long live the Three Principles of the People; (10) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (11) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Four Groups Hosted a Banquet for Hart Last Night; Lin Kanghou Delivered a Welcome Speech; Hart is Scheduled to Go to Hangzhou Today <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hart, the Economic Minister of the Dutch East Indies, are traveling in China and have been welcomed by all circles in Shanghai. In order to express the feeling of contact, the National Federation of Commerce, the Institute of International Studies, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the International Trade Association and other four groups, specially at 7:30 last night, held a banquet at the Bank Guild Club. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Guests at the Banquet: The banquet was held at 7:30 last night. The hosts included Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Chen Riping, Zeng Xianyuan, and Gu Huaibing, representatives of the National Federation of Commerce; Chen Zhezheng, Guo Bingwen, and Tu Chuyu, representatives of the Institute of International Studies; Ke Ganchen and Zheng Zenan, representatives of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Chen Changtong, Pan Guangjiong, and Shao Zenghua, representatives of the International Trade Association; and Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xinliu, Yu Qiaqing, Qian Chengxu, Chen Guangfu, He Dekui, Xu Peikun, Gan Haifeng, He Bingxian, Song Yizhong, Gao Dajing were invited to accompany them, and Lin Kanghou was elected as the chairman.</p>
<p>Representatives Delivered Speeches: During the session, Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the four groups, saying: Today, the National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the China International Trade Association, and the Institute of International Studies are welcoming Mr. Hart, the Economic Minister of the Dutch East Indies, and have prepared a humble feast to welcome Mr. Hart. We are very honored that Mr. Hart has taken the time to come. Tracing back to the friendly relations between China and the Netherlands, although geographically separated by Europe and Asia, the exchanges have been very early. In particular, the Dutch East Indies is adjacent to China, and the relationship is very close. The East Indies began to belong to the Netherlands in the 16th century, and in the Jin Dynasty in China, about 1,030 years ago, there was a monk named Faxian who returned to China from India and passed through Java. At that time, Chinese people had already lived there. Later, they continued to develop to various islands, and the number of Chinese people traveling south also increased from generation to generation. Until recently, the total number of Chinese people living on the islands of the East Indies was about 1.1 million. Initially, the islands of the East Indies only had scholars, and culture and commerce had not yet been developed. The Chinese worked hard and intentionally operated, and after being governed by the Netherlands, they cooperated to create the East Indies of today. To this day, the Chinese occupy a huge economic position in the East Indies. Therefore, looking back on the past and speculating on the future, the prosperity and decline of the East Indies are closely related to the Chinese. A few years ago, the East Indies was affected by the global economic downturn, and the market plummeted. The business of the Chinese was also greatly affected. I think Mr. Hart, as the Economic Minister of the Dutch East Indies, must have a plan in mind for how to promote the commerce between China and the Netherlands in the future, and how to restore the prosperity of the East Indies. This time, he came to China to investigate, and he should research the above two questions and reach a stable position. I, on behalf of the four groups, offer a toast to Mr. Hart and hope that Mr. Hart will come forward and give us guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Hart's Reply: Mr. Hart stood up and replied, saying: This time, I came to China to travel in a personal capacity. I am very grateful for the warm hospitality of all of you and the authorities of your country. When I passed through Hong Kong, I was also welcomed by the people of your country, which shows the friendly relations between China and the Netherlands. Your country is a country with thousands of years of culture, and the relationship between the two countries began very early. The number of Chinese people living in the Dutch East Indies is very large. In terms of historical relations, it has indeed benefited us a lot in cultural progress. At this time of economic downturn, all industries are declining. I am very willing to cooperate with your compatriots to seek development. I have known many people in your country for the past 15 years, and our relationship is harmonious. In particular, the working spirit of your people has always been admired. I wish all of you here good health.</p>
<p>Going to Hangzhou Today: Then, the chairman, guests, and hosts discussed the current international economic downturn and ways to remedy it. It ended at about 9:00 p.m. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned that Mr. and Mrs. Hart will go to Hangzhou for sightseeing this afternoon. In one or two days, they will go to Beijing to visit President Wang, Minister of Finance Kong, and Chief Secretary Chen, and then go to Peiping for sightseeing. It is expected that they will stay in Peiping for four days and then return to the country via Shanghai to resume their duties.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Soong Tzu-wen Appointed as Director of the Bank of China; Close Cooperation Among the Three Major Banks Has No Connection to Monetary Policy; Increase in Government Capital Does Not Change the Independent Nature of the Bank of China <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Speaks. National News Agency, 24/3/29, Local News: Finance Minister Kong told a National News Agency reporter that the increase in capital and the addition of directors to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are part of a long-held government policy to strengthen these three banks. Minister Kong also stated that in light of the general economic downturn in recent years, and the further difficulties resulting from recent US banking policies, the three banks should strive to cooperate in order to cope with the local market situation. Mr. T.V. Soong and others have been appointed by the government as directors of the Bank of China, and Mr. Zhang Jia'ao has been appointed as one of the vice presidents of the Central Bank. As for the Bank of Communications, there will be no other changes besides the government's additional appointment of official shareholder directors. Furthermore, the above-mentioned changes are purely to facilitate the cooperation of the three banks and to solidify the foundation of our country's banking industry. Minister Kong also declared that the close cooperation of these three major banks has no connection whatsoever with the government's monetary policy. The three banks will each maintain their inherent original status. Minister Kong solemnly declared again that the cooperation of the three banks will greatly benefit the government's intention to regulate the market, because although the market situation has improved somewhat recently, it is still hoped that our country's banking system can be further improved.</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen Speaks. A National News Agency reporter recently met with Mr. T.V. Soong, a standing committee member of the Economic Commission, and was informed that he had indeed been appointed as a director of the Bank of China. The government's measures for the three banks are to increase their strength and promote their close cooperation for substantial progress, so that they can fully exert their power to serve society. This is a long-planned scheme since the establishment of the National Government. From now on, the three banks together will be more effective in regulating the market and resolving various financial difficulties. As for the Bank of China itself, in addition to the increase in government capital, it remains completely independent in nature. Its business scope and all the privileges granted by the government will continue to be handled according to the old regulations, without any changes. Mr. Soong believes that the government's move is indeed a natural step to solidify the foundation of the domestic banking industry.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Bank of China Holds Shareholders' Meeting Today to Discuss the Issue of Increasing Government Shares; Original Articles of Association to be Amended; Candidates for Chairman of the Board Will Also Be Discussed <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the 100 million yuan financial bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance have been designated to allocate a portion for the shares in the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were originally jointly operated by government and private capital. Now that government shares have increased, there should be corresponding changes in the distribution of their organization. The shareholders' meeting of the Bank of China is scheduled to be held at 1:00 p.m. today, and all issues will be brought up for discussion.</p>
<p>Number of Directors and Supervisors Will Be Increased</p>
<p>The capital of the Bank of China was originally 25 million yuan, with 20 million yuan being private shares and 5 million yuan being government shares. Therefore, the distribution of directors and supervisors was in a ratio of five to one between the private and government sides. There were fifteen private shareholder directors, three government shareholder directors, five private shareholder supervisors, and one government shareholder supervisor. This time, the government allocated an additional 25 million yuan in capital, bringing the total to 30 million yuan. Therefore, the ratio of government to private shares will be three to two, and the number of government directors and supervisors will also be increased.</p>
<p>Incumbent Directors and Supervisors Will Not Be Re-elected</p>
<p>At today's shareholders' meeting, the matter of adding government shares will be formally submitted for approval. After approval, the number of shareholder rights on the government side will increase. As for the incumbent directors and supervisors, they will not be re-elected because their terms have not expired. However, the government will add to the number of directors and supervisors in accordance with the law by the Ministry of Finance. The candidates for the additional positions are currently under consideration and will be convened for a meeting of directors and supervisors after a decision is made. It is possible that the current chairman of the board, Li Fuxun, will be asked to resign.</p>
<p>Candidates for Chairman of the Board Will Be Discussed</p>
<p>The candidates for chairman of the board and general manager will be discussed at today's shareholders' meeting. Although the current chairman of the board, Li... and general manager Zhang Gongquan have not made any definite statements, it is feared that Mr. Zhang will find it difficult to manage both roles, as he has already been appointed as the vice president of the Central Bank. Mr. Zhang himself is currently considering whether to accept the new appointment. If he accepts the new appointment, he will inevitably resign from his position as the general manager of the Bank of China.</p>
<p>Original Articles of Association Will Also Be Amended</p>
<p>The original articles of association will also be submitted for discussion at today's shareholders' meeting. Since the Bank of China has increased government shares, there are several points that must be amended in terms of content. After the articles of association are amended, the process will proceed according to the new articles of association. Therefore, the matter of increasing government shares is the focus of discussion at today's meeting. Once the issue of government shares is resolved, other issues can proceed smoothly.</p>

<p>The Zilin Report states that Mr. Dikeman, the general manager of the American United Aircraft Export Company and a major in the army, has arrived in Shanghai from the United States with his wife. Mr. Dikeman was originally an electrical engineer, but later studied aviation and became very proficient. He has held various positions and served as the director of the Aircraft Division of the US Army Air Corps for several years. He has made many plans for the development of aviation. In 1929, he resigned from the army and became the chief engineer of the American Aircraft and Engine Company. For the past three years, he has served as a consulting aviation engineer for Changsi Folte Company, specializing in matters related to the company and the US Army and Navy. He often writes articles in various magazines and has authored a book on aviation. This time, he came to China and plans to spend several months studying China's commercial aviation issues. Then, based on his experience, he will develop an aircraft development program suitable for China. Mr. Dikeman will stay in China for at least six months and plans to travel to Nanjing, Beijing, Nanchang, and other places.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Full Text of the Sassoon Plan (Continued) <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>There is also a suggestion, created by some parties, to adopt a new currency based on the British pound to replace the existing currency. Silver is still the most suitable medium for foreign exchange in China, and the difficulties we encounter are mostly local rather than widespread. Therefore, we should not consider abandoning the silver standard. I have said this before.</p>
<p>What the United States is concerned about is the excess of both currency and credit, while what Shanghai is concerned about is the deficiency of both currency and credit. Using inflation to expand currency will inevitably cause harm, but if currency expansion can be achieved in a stable manner, the immediate benefits should be considerable.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest that there is something worth considering: if a British pound loan can be found, can it be used for the above-mentioned purposes, as a reserve for a kind of subsidiary currency or substitute currency, rather than for the dubious purpose of stabilizing or controlling foreign exchange? As for the issue of collateral for this kind of loan, it is of course still to be discussed, but what I want to say is the possibility of how much benefit a smaller debt can produce.</p>
<p>How much the amount is is extremely important. I don't want to estimate it. What I suggest is that if China can obtain a considerable amount of British pound loans, it can beneficially and safely issue a kind of banknote, with British pounds as collateral, and circulate it in the market together with the existing silver coins.</p>
<p>At first glance, this move does not seem to have any special benefits, and Shanghai may not have much demand for this kind of pound note. But if we consider it a little, this pound note can obviously have various uses in daily commerce. Let us first talk about the import problem. Currently, importers, if they cannot find a way to keep their capital in foreign currency before their imports are sold, must take the risk of foreign exchange at the time of import, and there is often the risk of loss on foreign exchange. If they do not want to lose, they must not sell the goods in hand, otherwise, they must go beyond the scope of the merchant's true business and hedge into exchange bills to protect themselves and prevent the exchange rate from rising. But this move can also allow competitors to seize their transactions with lower selling prices.</p>
<p>If exporters can not only not settle the exchange rate for the foreign currency cost of their goods, but also sell them in the same foreign currency, they do not take the risk of foreign exchange and can always know exactly how much profit they can get.</p>
<p>The above method can be applied to all importers who purchase goods from British pound countries and avoid the need to hedge into exchange bills. However, importers who purchase goods from other countries still need to buy exchange bills.</p>
<p>The claim that Shanghai should buy goods in British pounds over the counter seems bizarre at first glance, but in reality, it is something that often exists in the purchase and sale of many imported goods. Retail stores change their prices at any time according to the exchange rate. On the buyer's side, they are actually buying goods in foreign currency. If the goods are sold in British pounds and the buyer pays in pound notes, then the buyer may not need to use silver dollars at all.</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai may as well purchase pound notes or open British pound credit accounts in banks. Whether buying a bottle of whiskey, a foreign novel, a pair of foreign leather shoes, or a can of tobacco, they can all use it uniformly. The price will of course be subject to changes in the source. The price that the consumer pays in British pounds will not change from time to time.</p>
<p>Now assume that imported goods can be priced and paid in British pounds, then importers may as well pay their customs duties in this new currency. This is also one of the greatest uses of the new currency. The exchange rate between customs gold and local general silver dollars is determined daily, and the exchange rate between pound notes and silver dollars can also be determined in this way. In fact, given the current silver price, I do not see why customs gold should not be abolished and replaced with British pounds.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is not more disadvantageous than before, because the British pounds of customs revenue can still be used to repay foreign debt and overseas uses without any difficulty. As for purely domestic needs, such as clearing domestic bonds, the situation is no different from today when customs gold is collected. Export taxes can still be collected in silver.</p>
<p>If we consider how much of the goods purchased and services enjoyed in Shanghai come from foreign countries, we will see that the use of this new currency is not limited to buying and selling imported goods. Take hotels as an example. A large part of its expenses are attributed to overseas. The carpets, curtains, knives, etc. it places need to be replaced at any time. The alcoholic beverages it prepares must come from overseas. The employees it hires need to be paid in foreign currency. A large part of the hotel's revenue comes from the expenses of travelers coming to Shanghai. It is the wish of tourists to be able to avoid the difficulties of local foreign exchange. If a hotel cannot pay for its imports in Shanghai pound notes and set its prices, it will be more advantageous to convert most of its accounts into British pounds. If so, the demand for silver dollars can be eased a little. In practice, it may be necessary to supply some smaller representative currency systems. This substitute currency may as well be provided by the municipal council, such as the auxiliary currency issued by the city of Paris during the European War for small change.</p>
<p>Shanghai is not short of salaried classes who pay their full or part of their salaries in British pounds. They are very willing to receive their salaries in this new currency and avoid the labor of conversion.</p>
<p>Those who take leave to return home can carry this pound note with them. This currency will eventually become a kind of internationally circulating currency, like five-pound notes and one-pound notes.</p>
<p>I do not mean that this new currency should be a permanent currency in China, nor that it can be applied to other parts of China outside of Shanghai. However, this note will eventually have some circulation in other ports. I am only making this suggestion on a trial basis, as a possible way to expand currency without inflating currency, so as to overcome the difficult times we are currently encountering. Something that does not need to be imagined is that this currency will be more popular than ordinary currency for hoarding. If so, it is also beneficial to the public, because it can free up more silver dollars to circulate in the market, and this silver dollar must always be the main currency of China.</p>
<p>Regarding the agency for implementing this plan, I would like to briefly describe its method, but I admit that my opinion on this matter is quite fluid and not resolute at the current stage.</p>
<p>It seems that a committee can be organized to handle the issuance of pound notes, and the members of this committee should be representatives of the Ministry of Finance and Chinese and foreign banks.</p>
<p>The British pound loan obtained is handed over to the control of this committee, and the committee can then sell pound notes equal to the amount of the debt.</p>
<p>This currency may flow back to London after a certain period of time and take out the cash. In any case, since the debt is received, attention must be paid to payment. At this time, this committee should have received the cash capital from the sale of this kind of pound note.</p>
<p>This kind of pound note cannot be allowed for speculation, so the silver dollars received must be hedged out in the long term to protect them. At the same time, this silver dollar can be lent to banks for a certain period of time, so that the silver funds can be eased.</p>
<p>If the number of people who pay to purchase this pound note continues to increase, exceeding the total amount of the debt, then this committee must remit the cash capital it has received in order to reduce the overdraft in other areas. I can say that there is no need for bankers to say that, according to the plan I have said, considerable profits can be obtained to pay for printing and other expenses, and net profits can be obtained in the total allocation.</p>
<p>In summary, if this pound note can circulate freely, then this plan can first increase currency, and second can expand credit, because since there are pound coins, British pound loans based on Shanghai assets can be used freely, and banks will definitely be prepared to release British pound overdrafts.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to avoid interfering with China's existing currency, not only will it not hinder it, but it can also benefit it. I think everyone will agree. When the US silver policy changes, or when other factors occur that can help China get out of its current difficulties, this dual currency can be abolished immediately.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that for the purpose I said, it seems less difficult to find a British pound loan than any reason previously put forward to the UK, which has been met with difficulties. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Soong Tzu-wen Expresses Disapproval of the Sassoon Plan: Issuing Pound Notes is No Different From Adding Another Currency System, Which Will Cause Financial Disorder in Our Country <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Soong Tzu-wen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Committee, met with the giants of the local banking industry, Ye Zhuotang, Tang Shoumin, Li Fuxun, Xi Demao, and the Director of the Coinage Department of the Ministry of Finance, Xu Kan, at his residence yesterday morning to discuss opinions on stabilizing the local financial situation, and discuss the relief plan for Shanghai's financial situation published by Sir Sassoon. Mr. Soong then met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence at 12:00 p.m. and expressed his opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Dare Not Agree With Sassoon's Opinion</p>
<p>According to Mr. Soong, Sir Sassoon's financial relief plan advocates issuing Shanghai pound notes to relieve the financial panic in this city. I believe that if this move is realized, it will be enough to make the financial situation in our country more disordered. Because our country already has a currency system that circulates in the market, if Shanghai pound notes are issued again, it is no different from adding another currency system to our country, and the financial disorder will inevitably become more serious. Therefore, I dare not express my approval of Sassoon's suggestion. I predict that the financial authorities will definitely not approve of this either. The current instability of our country's financial situation is due to the instability of people's hearts. Therefore, if we want to seek financial stability, we must first stabilize people's hearts. As for the matter of local real estate merchant Cheng Linsheng and others initiating the raising of 450 million yuan in real estate circulating notes, Mr. Soong believes that it has not yet been studied whether this move can be enough to relieve the market.</p>
<p>Three Banks Cooperate, Financial Solidarity</p>
<p>The government has always intended to promote thorough cooperation between the three banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, so that our country's financial solidarity and capital can be increased to cope with difficult times. This time, the National Government appointed Zhang Gongquan as the vice president of the Central Bank in order to develop the bank's future business. After the Bank of China increases its government shares, the government will send me to be a director of the bank's government shares, because there is an explicit provision in the articles of association for the government to send directors. As for the original system of the Bank of China, it is unlikely to change much. The chairman of the board must be selected from among the directors, so the statement that I have been appointed is quite inconsistent. The statement of concurrently serving as general manager has never been heard. After the Bank of Communications increases its government shares, it will also add several directors, which has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Full Standing Committee Meeting Will Be Held Next Month</p>
<p>Mr. Soong continued, the 12th Standing Committee Meeting of the National Economic Committee will be held in Nanjing next month. I am currently preparing proposals for discussion and implementation. At that time, I will go to Nanjing and fly directly to Sichuan from Nanjing, but the exact date has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the newly appointed Mayor of Nanjing, Ma Chaojun, came to Shanghai by train with President Sun and others the night before last and returned to his residence after getting off the train in Zhenru at 7:15 a.m. yesterday morning. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mr. Ma at his residence and asked about his political views on taking office as the Mayor of Nanjing. According to the conversation, I came to Shanghai this time purely to visit my wife's throat disease and have no other official duties. The transfer of the Mayor of Nanjing is actually because Mayor Shi is overworked and sick and is seeking rest and has repeatedly resigned firmly. Mayor Shi has governed Nanjing City for just three years. In terms of municipal administration, there has been much progress. At present, the population of Nanjing City has increased from 350,000 to 850,000, and the number of newly built houses is also increasing day by day. However, there is still no solution in terms of finance, and the income is still less than half of the expenditure. Fortunately, the National Government has been providing assistance, which is sufficient to make up for it. I have been in politics for many years and have always advocated the principle of "governance is not about talking too much." After taking over, I will continue Mayor Shi's good policies and carry them forward, and improve those that are not appropriate. Civil servants should have guarantees. Unless there are special circumstances, or those who resolutely resign, I will never easily change them in order to correct the bad habits of the officialdom in our country that "a new emperor has new courtiers." A Central News Agency reporter also asked whether the Secretary-General and the heads of various bureaus have been internally appointed. Mr. Ma replied that for the position of Secretary-General, I intend to invite Legislative Committee Member Wang Shufang to serve concurrently and am currently seeking his consent. The heads of various bureaus have not been considered. I will return to Nanjing in a day or two. The date of taking office is still pending the completion of the handover by Mayor Shi, around the 10th of next month.</p>

<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Tax Commissioner Luford, in order to explain and supplement the regulations for the duty-free re-export of imported foreign silver, issued Joint Announcement No. 1440 yesterday, stating: "Regarding the regulations for the duty on import of foreign silver and subsequent re-export, this Customs has already issued Announcement No. 1431. Now, we have received an order from the Ministry of Finance to explain the first item of the aforementioned regulations and supplement the second item. We are to comply and announce this to the public, etc." In accordance with this, the full text of the regulations as currently explained and supplemented is transcribed below: (1) Foreign imported raw silver or national currency (each national currency should be based on containing 23.493448 grams of pure silver) will be allowed to be registered with the importing Customs with the imported amount and date. The Customs will issue a certificate. In the future, if there is a need for re-export, the original importer may submit the original certificate to the Ministry to exchange for a duty-free passport for the original amount of raw silver or national currency for export. The so-called "original amount" refers to the fact that when re-exporting, the raw silver and national currency of the same quantity as the original import shall be allowed, and it is not limited to the originally imported raw silver and national currency. If it is re-exported in batches, this passport may also be used, but it is limited to the amount listed on the original passport. (2) Those who hold the aforementioned duty-free passport for export, in addition to paying a tax of 2.25% (national currency and bars from the Central Mint are exempt from the 2.25% tax), the silver export tax and equalization tax levied from October 15th of the 23rd year will be exempted from full payment. (3) The import of raw silver must not be less than 500,000 ounces per time. If it is national currency, it should be converted and calculated. Let all merchants be aware of this. This announcement is hereby made.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Foreign Charity Association at 97 Renji Road believes that last year's drought was severe, and the disaster relief in various counties of Jiangsu and Ningbo is still ongoing, while the spring famine has arrived. In addition to Yixing and Liyang, which have jointly appointed special relief commissioners with the Jisheng Association to proceed in an orderly manner, the disaster in Haining, Zhejiang, is particularly severe. Last winter, it jointly implemented emergency relief with the Jisheng Association. Now, the wheat season is still far away, and there is a shortage of food. The disaster victims are all waiting to die. However, the association's funds have been exhausted. At this time, Zhu Xiangsheng and Songsheng, brothers and owners of the Yuanhe Shendou Maixing in the South City, who are happy to do good deeds, generously donated 400 bags of white rice, designating the villages of Xieqiao and Qingyun in that county for relief. In addition, Mr. Chen Zhinai donated 35 bags of rice, designating the Yanguan Town in the urban area, and entrusted the association to choose the most needy areas for distribution. This can be described as timely relief. The association sent personnel and invited Father Ding Maoliang of the Chang'an Catholic Church, along with Cui Jialu, Ye Duomao, Fang Shaoyao, and Liu Baokang, to assist in the actual investigation and distribution. Mr. Yang Zhongyao also provided voluntary assistance. The investigation and distribution was completed the day before yesterday. According to the report returned to Shanghai, the drought last year was very severe, and there was no harvest. In addition, in the past three years, the silkworm industry has suffered a tragic decline, and the rural economy has gone bankrupt. Most of the strong men have fled due to the famine. The elderly, weak, and women are begging for food in the towns and cities, all eating thin porridge with bran and wild vegetables. Their faces are pale. They even disregard the wind and rain, dismantling houses and selling bricks to seek a full meal. In this situation, they are unable to cultivate in the spring, which will have a significant impact on the future. The relief workers believe that the disaster victims are eagerly awaiting food, so they should urgently investigate and distribute it. This time, 4,000 households received relief. With three people per household, it can still save tens of thousands of people from immediate crisis. However, it is also a drop in the bucket. We urgently hope that all sectors will continue to maintain this effort to avoid losing all previous efforts.</p>

<p>The disaster areas in more than ten counties in Jiangsu Province, such as Liyang, Lishui, and Gaochun, have been allocated funds and personnel by the Drought Relief Association and various charitable organizations for relief. Although it is a drop in the bucket, providing assistance in times of need can still save many lives. The northwestern and southern villages (i.e., Zones 8 and 9) of Jiangdu have also suffered a severe disaster. Despite repeated appeals, no relief has been provided. According to Mr. Cheng Yiqing, who has returned to Shanghai after inspection, the northwestern and southern villages of the county are vast, almost equal to the area of another small county. The disaster-affected area is estimated to be hundreds of square miles, with more than 100,000 disaster-stricken households. The disaster is due to years of drought and famine, which was particularly severe last year, resulting in almost no harvest. The disaster victims have been without grain for a long time. Fortunately, the winter was not cold, and they were able to survive on green vegetables, radishes, and yams. Now, the grass roots have been eaten almost entirely. The disaster victims' faces are withered, their waists are bent, and they are desperately waiting for help.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Anti-Spitting Campaign <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Workers' Day: Since the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched the anti-spitting campaign, in order to promote it universally and achieve practical results, it has specially stipulated Students' Day, Workers' Day, Merchants' Day, and various organizations' days. The conference opened at the Lido Grand Theater the day before yesterday. All sectors are assisting in the implementation with all their efforts. Yesterday was the second day of the campaign, Workers' Day. The Shanghai General Trade Union supervised all trade unions and workers to mobilize and promote it widely. In addition to printing and distributing a letter to workers, they also sent people to major factories to persuade and warn workers. At the same time, the trade unions held separate meetings to lecture on the harm of spitting and methods of preventing tuberculosis, so that all workers could be vigilant. After listening to the lectures, the workers also promoted it to their families and friends.</p>
<p>Merchants' Day: Today is Merchants' Day. The city's Chamber of Commerce has instructed all businesses to post slogans and declarations inside the counters to promote it. At the same time, large slogans spanning the roads, such as "No Spitting on Roads, Cars, and Public Places," were posted on Nanjing Road, Gongguan Road, and North Railway Station to attract the attention of citizens. The City Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration yesterday, which stated: "The most important things are often started from the most subtle and superficial things. Spitting anywhere is regarded as a very common and unimportant thing by most people. However, once germs are spread, it can lead to loss of life in serious cases and medical expenses in minor cases, causing loss of money or even loss of employment due to illness. Not to mention the health of the entire nation, personal loss is already not small. So, why do people spit anywhere? It is just for laziness and convenience. No matter how tight one's economy is, it is always possible to prepare a spittoon at home or in the store. When a person goes out, a handkerchief is always carried. Therefore, it is not difficult to avoid spitting anywhere. As long as you get rid of the laziness and convenience, you may feel a little unaccustomed at first, but it will become natural over time. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce will add a few words to the meaning of the Anti-Spitting Campaign Conference, hoping that all business circles in the city will pay attention."</p>

<p>On the afternoon of January 14th of this year, the French police cracked down on an organization that manufactured counterfeit silver dollars at No. 3, Lane 372, East End, Dapu Bridge, Xujiahui Road.

Equipment, lathes, wind furnaces, lead bars, and more than 100 empty silver dollar shells and a basin of silver skin were seized. They were sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution. After the trial, Lin Tai, Wei Shun, Chen Chuncheng, and Huang Puwen were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment and five years of deprivation of civil rights. Mei Yunguong and Lin Jianan were each sentenced to three years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of civil rights. All the exhibits were confiscated. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. However, the convicts were dissatisfied with the original sentence and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The collegial panel of the Higher Court conducted a retrial. After the debate, the date for the sentence was set for the day before yesterday. Chief Judge Guo, along with Two judges, and Prosecutor Zhang opened the court and ordered the appellants to be brought to court. The sentence was revoked, and the six people, including Lin Tai, were each reduced to two years and six months of imprisonment. After the sentencing, the appellants were returned to the detention center to await the final sentence before being sent to prison.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Dentist Zhang Weiliang Accused of Assaulting His Wife; Isn't Once Enough? Past Love Flows Away <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Brothers Dental Hospital at No. 3 Zhifu Road was founded by the dentist Zhang Weiliang and his brothers. Weiliang is the youngest. Since its opening, the business has been doing well. Ten years ago, a female student surnamed Dong from Ningbo, who was studying at the Patriotic Girls' School, sought treatment from Zhang Weiliang for a dental disease. They became acquainted. At that time, Zhang was just a young man in his early twenties and had no partner. He found Ms. Dong to be beautiful and well-educated, so he was very fond of her. He tried hard to pursue her, and soon the lovers became a couple. They rented a house at No. 1057 Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road, and lived together. For ten years, they loved each other and had a harmonious relationship. However, in recent years, Zhang's wife, Ms. Dong, suspected that her husband was ambitious and did not return home at night, and that living expenses were often lacking. She advised Weiliang, which angered him, and quarrels often occurred. One day, the couple had a dispute over a minor matter, which turned into violence. Ms. Zhang Dong was injured in the assault and reported it to the police station. Zhang Weiliang was summoned to the First Special Court for a trial. The court advised Ms. Zhang Dong not to hurt the past feelings over such a trivial matter between husband and wife, which is a common occurrence. Ms. Zhang heard the advice and expressed her agreement. The case was withdrawn. However, not long after, at about 2:00 PM on the 18th of last month, Ms. Zhang Dong went to the Brothers Dental Hospital to question her husband because he had reverted to his old ways and was not providing enough living expenses. They disagreed and eventually resorted to violence. At this time, Ms. Zhang Dong was six months pregnant and nearing her due date. After being assaulted, she was in pain all over her body. Out of resentment, she reported to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Sun Dafa was sent to investigate and sent her to the hospital to verify the injuries. He reported back to the police chief, who requested the First Special Court to issue a summons. Last Thursday, Zhang Weiliang was summoned to the Second Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him for injury under Article 293 of the Criminal Law. After the interrogation, the hearing was adjourned to another date. Yesterday morning, the case was scheduled for a further hearing, but Ms. Zhang Dong had given birth a week ago and was unable to attend. Judge Zhan Liangce briefly questioned the defendant Zhang Weiliang and ordered Zhang to provide a guarantor who would be available at any time and adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 24th.</p>

<p>Sang Zhichen, a woman from Ningbo, 22 years old, is currently working as a teacher at the Ningbo Seventh Elementary School in Jinchun Lane, Meibai Road. Yesterday morning at 11:00, she hired a rickshaw No. 8301 from the North Station to go to school. The rickshaw puller's name was Dong Gaowen (33 years old, from Yancheng, living at No. 11 Changxing Lane, Eryang Road, Zhabei). When the rickshaw drove to the entrance of the Xinzha car shop on Avenue Edward VII, a truck suddenly drove up from behind, registered as No. 16525. Because the driver was driving at full speed and could not stop, it slammed into Sang's rickshaw, causing the young woman Sang Zhichen to be run over by the truck's wheels and severely injured. She lost consciousness on the spot. The rickshaw puller Dong Gaowen also suffered a head injury and was bleeding. At that time, another rickshaw puller named Zhu Xinghe, 41 years old, from Jiangbei (living at a certain number, Nanlin Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei) was also pulling an empty rickshaw coming from the opposite direction, and was caught in the crossfire. His leg bone was crushed, and blood flowed like a torrent. The Xinzha Police Station saw this and quickly recorded the number of the car that caused the accident. The truck driver was detained in the police station for investigation. The three injured were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is said that Sang's internal injuries are so severe that her life may be in danger.</p>

<p>Chen Fengshi, a veteran revolutionary comrade, embraced the doctrine early in his life and worked for the revolution. In the 7th year of the Republic, he served as the General Staff Officer under Xiong Kewu's command, fighting to the death with the warlords of the Northern Army. In the 9th year of the Republic, he resigned from his military post and subsequently served as a counselor of the Grand Marshal's Office. In recent years, he lived at home due to heart disease. Whenever there were major national and local plans, veteran comrades from Sichuan would still consult him. On the eve of his death, he suddenly heard that his old friend Shi Qingyang had died in Baolong Hospital, and he was deeply saddened. The excessive stimulation caused his illness to suddenly worsen, and he died at his Shanghai residence at 4:45 AM on March 26th. He was destitute after his death, and all funeral expenses were borrowed by sympathetic friends. The encoffining is scheduled to take place at 2:00 PM today at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road. It is reported that members of the Central Committee from Sichuan plan to propose to the Central Government that he be given a pension and commendation.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Procedures for Applying for Private Rickshaw Licenses <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Work Bureau issued Proclamation No. 4571 yesterday regarding the newly revised procedures for applying for private rickshaw licenses, which reads: "Proclamation. It has been noted that private rickshaw licenses will no longer be issued by the Donation and Tax Section of this Bureau's General Office after 5:00 PM on March 28th of this year. In the future, applications must be made at the Private Rickshaw Licensing Office at 596 Gongping Road during the following hours: From October 1st to the end of April, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM; from May 1st to the end of September, from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM. The licensing hours on Saturdays will be until 11:30 AM. The following newly revised procedures will be implemented from March 29th of this year. All those who wish to apply for private rickshaw licenses for the quarter beginning April 1st of this year are requested to take note of the following: The application form must be signed or stamped by the license holder. Blank application forms can be obtained from the Private Rickshaw Licensing Office on Gongping Road, the Donation and Tax Section of this Bureau's General Office, and various police stations. Each applicant should fill out the application form as required and submit it to the Licensing Office on Gongping Road, where a license number will be assigned. In the future, the original license holder should continue to use this number when renewing the license each quarter. The porcelain license plate issued by this Bureau should be affixed to the upper left side of the rickshaw. When paying the license fee, the small porcelain tag, which indicates the license number and has a different color each quarter, should be attached to the license plate to easily identify whether the license has expired. Registered license holders are responsible for paying the license fee as long as they retain the license plate. If they do not wish to renew the license, they should return the license plate to the Licensing Office. If the license holder does not renew the license within twenty-one days after the license expires, this Bureau may consider the license to be canceled and reassign the number to someone else. A registration fee of five jiao in silver currency should be paid when the license number is assigned. Therefore, those who wish to apply for the June quarter license should pay their representative eight yuan and five jiao in silver currency if they do not collect it in person. When renewing the license each quarter, eight yuan will be charged as usual. Residents of the French Concession and the Nanshi area should apply to the French Concession Public Works Bureau for licenses valid for both concessions. Residents of the Public Concession and the roads outside the concession, or Zhabei, should apply to this Bureau for licenses valid for both concessions. If a business or other organization wishes to apply for licenses for vehicles used by its employees, they should apply to this Bureau or the French Concession Public Works Bureau, depending on where the headquarters or main office is located. When filling out the application form, be careful to ensure that all information provided is accurate. If a license is obtained by falsifying names or addresses, it will be revoked upon discovery. This proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge."</p>
<h3 id="e133">Special District Rickshaw Guild – Preventing Lessors from Overcharging Rental Fees – Vehicle Committee Orders Owners to Introduce Rickshaw Pullers for Registration – Misunderstanding Arises in the French Concession from Investigation of Owners and Pullers <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Work Bureau's Rickshaw Affairs Committee will continue to order rickshaw owners to introduce rickshaw pullers for registration. The Special District Rickshaw Guild has issued a notice to prevent lessors from overcharging rental fees. A misunderstanding has arisen in the French Concession from the investigation of owners and pullers by the police. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Vehicle Committee Orders Recommendation of Pullers</p>
<p>The Public Concession Work Bureau's Rickshaw Affairs Committee has decided to issue 9,990 rickshaw puller recommendation forms in early April, when the April rickshaw licenses are issued, to facilitate rickshaw owners in continuing the procedure of recommending and completing the registration of rickshaw pullers. In addition, each rickshaw owner will be issued an investigation form, requesting them to fill in the names and addresses of those who lease their vehicles, in order to facilitate investigation.</p>
<p>Guild Prevents Overcharging of Rental Fees</p>
<p>The Special District Office of the Rickshaw Guild issued a notice to all rickshaw owners yesterday to prevent the overcharging of rental fees, which reads: "Notice. It has been found that on August 6th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the representatives of this office and the representatives of the Public Concession Bureau agreed that the rental fee should be 7 jiao 8 fen in silver dollars per vehicle per day, plus 7 fen in silver dollars for the mutual aid fund, for a total of 8 jiao 5 fen. Furthermore, on November 23rd, the Public Concession Bureau's Rickshaw Affairs Committee and the representatives of this office exchanged documents approving the collection of additional fees for savings, accommodation, and other expenses, but receipts must be issued and accounted for. This is a mutually agreed-upon decision and cannot be changed without the consent of both parties. According to an investigation by the Public Concession Bureau's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, some lessors are reportedly overcharging rental fees, which violates the agreement between this office and the Public Concession Bureau. Although the lessors are responsible for the losses suffered by the rickshaw owners, the rickshaw owners are still responsible under the license regulations. All members are requested to check the rental collection methods of the lessors at any time and ensure that they strictly comply with the regulations agreed upon between this office and the Public Concession Bureau. Otherwise, rickshaw owners shall be responsible for any disputes that may arise. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Arises from Investigation of Owners</p>
<p>The French Concession police are investigating rickshaw owners in the southern Shanghai area, and some rickshaw pullers mistakenly believe that the French Concession will follow the British Concession in registering rickshaw pullers, including taking photographs and fingerprints. Therefore, they have returned to their hometowns in droves. The Rickshaw Guild has issued a notice to all rickshaw owners to explain the situation, which reads: "Recently, the French Concession police have sent personnel to investigate the real rickshaw owners in the Nanshi area. Their intention is to facilitate future management. However, this has led to some rickshaw pullers spreading all kinds of unfounded rumors and rushing back to their villages as if a great disaster were about to befall them. Their desperate situation is also pitiful. According to reports from various rickshaw businesses, this self-inflicted disturbance is affecting the livelihoods of the poor and social order. Therefore, we earnestly advise all rickshaw businesses to guide their rickshaw pullers to work with peace of mind and not to be misled by these rumors, which will harm themselves and others. If you see any unscrupulous elements spreading rumors, you can take them to the nearest police station for interrogation to eliminate these harmful elements and serve as a warning to others. Please pay attention and do not listen to rumors."</p>

<p>On the morning of November 21st of last year, the Shanghai Bank's Yuyuan Road branch in western Shanghai sent a clerk with 5,200 yuan in cash in a bank-owned car to the Xujiahui Jiaotong University Savings Office. On the way, in the French Concession on Haig Road, peasants carrying straw blocked the road. Suddenly, robbers rushed forward and stole all the money before escaping. Afterwards, the French police special unit arrested the robbers Zhang Zilong, Huang Shuncai, Fei A'mei, Huang Yaosheng, Zhu Xuenneng (the messenger from Jiaotong University), and more than ten others. Over 200 yuan in stolen money was recovered. It was also found that Zhang Zilong had previously committed two other robberies in the French Concession. They were sent to the Second Special District Court, and the police lawyer filed a public prosecution for gang robbery. After the trial, Zhang Zilong was sentenced to three counts of robbery, serving eleven years of imprisonment. Huang Shuncai was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Fei A'mei, Huang Yaosheng, and Zhu Xuenneng were each sentenced to five years of imprisonment. The remaining defendants were either not prosecuted due to the police finding no evidence of a crime, or acquitted because there was no evidence of a crime. These details have been reported previously. Now, the five robbers Zhang, Huang, Fei, and Zhu have appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court, according to the appeal, specially opened an investigation court yesterday, presided over by Judge Fan Pei'en. Each defendant stated their reasons for appeal, either complaining that the sentence was too heavy or denying the crime. They were vague about the real reasons. After verifying the statements, the court ordered a postponement for further investigation and interrogation. The appellants were returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>The No. 1390 barge of the Xin Quanji Barge Company, loaded with 47 tons of Beipiao coal dust from Shihe Coal Company, was passing by the Dachu Warehouse at 1:30 PM on March 28th when the Japanese ship Yueyang Maru was entering the port and intending to dock. The black ball was not raised, nor was a sound made. Due to the shipowner's careless steering, the ship blocked the river with its bow facing east and its stern facing west. As a result, the blades of the ship's stern struck the coal boat amidships, causing the boat and its cargo to sink completely. All the workers fell into the water at the same time. Fortunately, they were rescued by a boat and did not drown. The losses were enormous. The barge company has reported the incident to the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Guild, which has forwarded it to the River and Sea Customs Ship Management Office for a fair judgment. In the meantime, the Guild is directly negotiating with the Nissin Steamship Company.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Municipal Council Approves Telephone Price Increase – Taxpayers Association Sends Stern Letter of Inquiry Yesterday – Requests Special Attention to Two Points <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Since the Public Concession Municipal Council agreed to a 12.5% price increase requested by the Telephone Company, public opinion has been in an uproar. The Chinese Taxpayers Association, believing that the Municipal Council has disregarded the opinions of taxpayers, sent a stern letter of inquiry yesterday, which reads: "Sir, the case of the Shanghai Telephone Company's request for a price increase has been under observation by this Association, and we requested your council to postpone the review, but we have not yet received a reply. According to reports, the head of your council's finance department believes that only a 12.5% increase should be allowed. Whether this calculation is reasonable is not our concern. However, the fact that your council has not paid attention to the opinions of taxpayers has been demonstrated by the facts and cannot be ignored by taxpayers. The opposition to the telephone price increase has been overwhelming in the city recently, and those who have come to this Association to express their opposition, such as general users on Nanjing Road, are even more agitated. From the perspective of this Association: (1) The commercial situation is so precarious, and capital profits are declining. Forcing the Telephone Company to obtain a 10% profit is unfair. (2) Forcing the Telephone Company to obtain a 10% profit, thereby increasing the burden on taxpayers and reducing their tax-paying ability, is benefiting a private business at the expense of public revenue. (3) Metering by call, according to tests, a single phone is about one to ten, and several phones are at least one to three. That is, beyond the monthly limit of one hundred calls, according to the former example, one would actually need a thousand calls, and according to the latter example, one would actually need three hundred calls. In this case, although the usage fee is nominally ten yuan per month, according to the former example, one would actually pay much more than the current rate. After this Association firmly presents the above opinions to your Chairman, we request that special attention be paid to the following two points: (1) Are the interests of taxpayers the same as the interests of the Telephone Company? (2) Where is the foundation of the Municipal Council built? We respectfully request that you investigate and consider the general economic situation and postpone the review of this case. We hope you will do so."</p>

<p>Sun Guozhang, a tea merchant from Anhui in Shanghai, previously had an affair with a woman named Wang and lived with her at 12 Yongnianfang, Kad Road. He adopted a daughter named Yueying, who is nineteen years old and unmarried. However, after Sun returned to Anhui, he did not come to Shanghai for a long time, and the lives of Wang and her daughter were quite difficult. Yang Guifang, who lived in the same house, showed great affection for Yueying. Yueying, feeling that her adoptive mother's treatment was not very good, was deeply moved by Yang's sincerity and repeatedly expressed her willingness to be his concubine and signed a note with Yang. Later, Yang's wife found out and gently persuaded him. Yang also realized that the matter would not work out and, to avoid suspicion, moved away at the end of last year. Shortly after Yang moved out, Yueying, unable to bear her mother's abuse, also ran away and took refuge with relatives. Later, Sun and Wang found her and discovered the note on her person, believing that Yang had an affair with their daughter. They enlisted the help of their fellow villager Zhan Shuren to negotiate with Yang, demanding that he pay 10,000 yuan to settle the matter. When negotiations broke down, Sun and Wang, as the legal guardians of Sun Yueying, filed a criminal complaint against Yang for disrupting the family and also filed a private lawsuit, seeking 12,000 yuan in damages. Yang hired lawyer Sun Biwu to defend him, arguing that Sun and Wang were trying to extort money and requesting a strict investigation. The First Special District Local Court summoned both parties for a secret investigation and concluded that there was no evidence to support the plaintiff's claims, finding Yang Guifang not guilty. However, the plaintiff was not satisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. When the court opened yesterday, Sun and Wang were still absent, making it impossible to proceed. Lawyer Sun immediately stated in court that the appellant had avoided appearing at the previous hearing, and the same was true today, indicating that their claims were false and requesting a clear investigation. Judge Yu then postponed the hearing and ordered another summons.</p>

<p>Zhang Boyong, a worker at the Guangming Glass Factory from Suzhou, lived with Lu Fangshi, a widow, after having an affair with her at 15 North Fujian Road. Recently, Lu Fangshi became pregnant and, fearing that her belly would gradually swell and affect her appearance, she hired midwife Ma Pan to perform an abortion on the 10th of this month. As a result, although the fetus was aborted, Lu Fangshi suffered internal injuries and died after several days despite medical treatment. After the Huisi police learned of this, they arrested Lu Fangshi and Zhang Boyong and sent them to the First Special District Court. The police prosecuted them for abortion under Articles 305 and 307 of the Criminal Code. After several interrogations, the trial has now concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui, presiding over the Eighth Criminal Court, announced the verdict: Ma Pan, with the intent to profit, received the request of a pregnant woman to perform an abortion, resulting in her death, and was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was finalized will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Considering her old age, the sentence is suspended for three years. Zhang Boyong was found not guilty. The medicines seized in the case could not be proven to have been used for the crime and should be returned. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin also declared in court that he would waive the appeal. Therefore, both defendants were immediately released.</p>

The average harvest volume of summer crops in various provinces was less than 60% of a full year, about 70% of a normal year. Among them, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, etc., were better, reaching more than 70% of a full year. Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, etc., were next, reaching about 70% of a full year. Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, Sichuan, and Guizhou, etc., were next again, reaching about 60% of a full year. Other provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan had the lowest, only 40% to 50% of a full year. In terms of product type, rice and soybeans accounted for about 55% of a full year, glutinous rice accounted for 57%, cotton accounted for 56%, sorghum and sweet potatoes accounted for 63%, millet accounted for 64%, corn and sesame accounted for 59%, peanuts accounted for 62%, and tobacco and broomcorn millet accounted for 61%. China's agricultural production technology has been very degraded, coupled with the rampant disasters, and it is difficult to expect a bumper harvest.</p>
<p>In terms of agricultural product prices, prices fell sharply in the first five months. For example, the average price of Suzhou Tong glutinous rice in April was only 6 yuan and 80 cents per shi, a decrease of more than 30 cents compared to the same period last year. The average price of railway wheat in May was 6 yuan and 30 cents per hectoliter, a decrease of 1 yuan and 40 cents compared to the same period last year. The average price of Shanghai cotton in April was 42 yuan, 65 cents, a decrease of 5 yuan, 37 cents compared to the same period last year. After June, affected by the drought, rice and wheat prices rose. Cotton prices also tended to rise due to the later listing of Henan and Shaanxi cotton and the strong purchases by foreign merchants. The average price of Suzhou Tong glutinous rice in August rose to 11 yuan and 70 cents. The price of railway wheat in December rose to 8 yuan. The average price of Shanghai cotton in August also rose to more than 7 yuan and 80 cents. For the general trend of agricultural product prices, please refer to Table 8. According to the table, grains, textile raw materials, beans, and kernels all fell first and then rose, while livestock products all trended downward. The overall index was 5.3% lower than in the 22nd year. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e162">Where Did Alcestis Go? <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Luo</p>
<p>Ibsen wrote "A Doll's House," and Nora finally shouted, "I'm leaving immediately." So Nora left the family and went into society. Naturally, Ibsen could only write up to this point. He could never tell us what would happen to Nora when she entered society, and whether the problems would be easily solved after entering society? Ibsen couldn't solve these problems.</p>
<p>Because a certain professor told me that classical works generally have no content. He specifically pointed out Moliere, saying that Moliere's works are also empty of content and have no thought. I was skeptical, so I found a copy of "The Misanthrope" to read. As a result, I discovered that the professor had deceived me. "The Misanthrope" has content. (Originally, content and form are an inseparable unity.) From "The Misanthrope," I saw a male Nora. He is the protagonist of "The Misanthrope," "Alcestis." Alcestis is a misanthrope, he hates the hypocrisy of the world, he hates those aristocrats who wear masks. The aristocrats are so hypocritical, formalistic, and falsely modest. Therefore, Alcestis indignantly said: "A swindler, a shameless rogue, a confounded robber, everyone thinks so, no one denies it. However, his ugliness is welcomed everywhere: everyone entertains him, everyone greets him with a smile, he has a place everywhere; even the most capable people cannot compete with him." Alcestis was distressed. Because he honestly criticized an aristocrat's poem, saying, "Your poem is only good for throwing in the toilet." Therefore, the aristocrat sued him. He also discovered that his lover was so false and lewd; his honesty also provoked others to slander him. So, he was saddened, he extremely hated this world. Finally, he decided to break away from this sinful society and go to the desert. In the last act, he said: "I am deceived everywhere, oppressed by all kinds of injustice. I am going to jump out of this evil-ridden 壑, go far away to find a remote place where I can freely be a gentleman."</p>
<p>Nora and Alcestis are somewhat similar: Nora wants to break away from the hateful doll family, and Alcestis wants to break away from this hateful society. However, neither Ibsen nor Moliere can completely solve the problems of Nora and Alcestis.</p>
<p>In fact, "Alcestis is Moliere himself, representing a bourgeois surrounded by an aristocratic environment and resisting it." Moliere has a kind of great spirit, not at all like the professor thinks he is a writer who flatters the aristocracy. He "violently attacked the aristocracy, he mocked the powerful people of the time with great boldness." When "Tartuffe" was publicly performed, it aroused the anger of the monks, and the priests and archbishops all sued him. When Napoleon I read his work, he said: "If this play were made in my time, then I would not allow it to be performed." Therefore, Moliere is not a flatterer of the aristocracy, but a rebel of the aristocracy. From "The Misanthrope," can't you see how much Moliere hates the aristocracy? However, Moliere, like Ibsen, Tolstoy... all wrote about all the social contradictions and ugliness; however, they could not give this "contradiction" a correct solution. Moliere hated society and the aristocracy, but he also lived in this ugly and dirty atmosphere. This contradiction entangled him, so he created an ideal character—Alcestis. Moliere made Alcestis break away from this society and go to the desert to live his "gentleman's" life in solitude. Naturally, this is Moliere's fantasy, and it is also his way of resolving "contradictions." Ibsen brought Nora out of the family, thinking that he had solved the women's problem; similarly, Moliere made Alcestis break away from society, also thinking that he had solved this ugly social problem.</p>
<p>Today's society is also ugly. Like Alcestis, we also feel contradictions and "melancholy." People are all living hypocritically and uglily. Especially those who live suspended in the air feel a deeper contradiction and hate this society more. However, where does Alcestis ultimately go? As Moliere wrote, to the road of fantasy? However, people can never survive outside of society! Therefore, Alcestis cannot go to the road of fantasy, but should come to reality! Break away from his "court" (old nest) and come into "life"!</p>
<h3 id="e163">Singapore Night <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>The night of Singapore is seized in the hands of a black devil.</p>
<p>The night, on the seashore of Lion Island, illuminated by electric lights from tall and majestic cement buildings, is the brilliant outer garment of the splendid capitalist land. Inside this garment, however, the night of Singapore is tightly held in the hands of the devil. The heart of the decaying face of the city is turbulent, palpitating, and festering, waiting for the day when the city will be blasted open.</p>
<p>When the clanging sound of money is put away in the vault during the day, the night of Singapore is buried in the excess of money. At dusk, the wealthy use cars to cruise around, and at night, the European and American investors at the Raffles Hotel dance the crazy jazz in the red lights and green wine. The Capital Theater spits out idle rich people who appreciate American-style love dramas; and the streets are crowded with tourists, ice and soda overflowing in the city at night.</p>
<p>In Dapo, the daughters of the empire in the land of the rising sun kneel under the green light to welcome guests, and self-skinned women sell themselves in secret prostitution; in the Great World and the New World, Chinese bosses and young masters are bargaining with women who sell their flesh; this city is full of pitiful women wandering from other countries.</p>
<p>A dark-skinned, rough-looking Indian devil keeps watch for the rich late at night, and a rattan sleeping mat lying in front of a splendid shop looks like a dog kennel. In the corners of quiet streets, dim electric lights illuminate the lonely policeman standing guard. The unemployed once lay on the sidewalks, and the haggard faces illuminated by the dim electric lights looked like ghostly shadows.</p>
<p>Among the crowds enjoying the cool on the hot and bustling Lion Island seashore, the bright night moon will illuminate the wandering, miserable shadows of frustrated people from other countries. Beside the European War Memorial, wandering youths from other countries will gaze north and feel melancholy about their homeland. In the corners of quiet coasts, with a plop, the majestic tide will swallow the life of a weak loser.</p>
<p>When the city falls into the deep night, and silence engulfs the surging tide of humanity, the wealthy will sleep soundly, embracing passionate daughters of the south, while the bodies of the unemployed will be hanging in the suburban groves. Or when the thunder rumbles and the wealthy are awakened from their sweet dreams, one or two gunshots will rob people and steal property. In the morning, the Singapore market will be bustling as usual, while the rulers will rack their brains about the disasters brought about by the "recession."</p>
<p>Even more terrifying are the propaganda articles posted on the pink walls and the leaflets and slogans painted on the electric light poles. The unemployed are making a silent roar in the night of the city, and the colonized people are preparing for a day of turning over. Among the isolated, the witch doctors will actually unite, and among the white people will also emerge "traitors to the country."</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the tall buildings on the Lion Island seashore face the sea with proud postures, and the city lights illuminate the rushing cars, this night in Singapore is nurturing future bombs, wrapping up sins, and burying new pregnancies.</p>
<p>The night in Singapore is the night of a world city. In addition to her individuality, the night in Singapore also has her universal nature of the world.</p>
<p>Night, however, is nurturing the bright tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Wind of February <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ping</p>
<p>Wrapped in a purple cloth, Fu Sheng felt as if a hazy net had been cast before his eyes, and he dared not take another glance at this ancient home. He lowered his head and walked straight onto the official road.</p>
<p>The sky was high and clear, without a single cloud. The wind of February gently caressed the willow trees beside the official road, but it could not blow away the melancholy that weighed on Fu Sheng's heart.</p>
<p>He couldn't remember when it was, it was almost a dream: in the ancient home he had abandoned, lived an old couple whom Fu Sheng called Father and Mother. In those days, passing a day seemed as easy as scattering grains of sand. Before the sun had even peeked out from the mountain hollow, the fields were already filled with the sound of mountain songs echoing back and forth. His father always watched him go to the fields and greeted him upon his return. The old man was forever smoking his early morning pipe, and he felt that the world had already given mankind more than it deserved. At dinner, he liked to drink a few cups of white liquor, and his wrinkled face would turn as red as the evening glow. Then he would begin to recount the story of how the previous generation started their business, never tiring of the details. But he lacked the talent for storytelling, and the children from the neighborhood who had gathered would automatically disperse. The only listener was Fu Sheng; he didn't feel as satisfied with the story as his father did. He had a hope hidden deep in his heart – a hope to build a business so much bigger than his father's that it would amaze him, built upon his pair of iron arms!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, a surge of heat rose from the bottom of his heart. He wanted to laugh, but he immediately became aware; it was a dream – like a nightmare he woke up from as a child.</p>
<p>He stood still on the bridgehead, his lonely shadow reflected in the river. The people he called Father and Mother had left this world during a succession of hardship-filled days. As his father lay dying, he held Fu Sheng's hand and said, "The world has changed! You must strive!" And with that, he breathed his last.</p>
<p>As that trembling voice rang in his ears, Fu Sheng turned back to stare again at that ancient home and the patch of land overgrown with weeds – his pair of strong arms had already grown sore, and his legs were so tired that they could no longer support his weight; but what was the result of his efforts? A purple cloth bundle on his shoulder!</p>
<p>The February wind gently brushed the hair that hung down to his ears. He looked at the wharf where the boats were docked ahead, and a new hope surged within him, urging him forward.</p>
<p>——At the end of the year, after being released from prison, A'gen enthusiastically invited him to his home, just like when he picked up his purple cloth bundle. A'gen's home had nothing but four collapsing walls and a worthless wooden board.</p>
<p>He gripped Fu Sheng's hand with a force almost like hand-to-hand combat with an enemy. He said, "Our fate is over – the entire Liu Family Village is over! With our pair of strong hands, let's go outside and find a world of gold!"</p>
<p>That voice was like a thunderclap, stunning Fu Sheng. He never knew his pair of hands could be used for anything other than wielding a hoe. He didn't trust A'gen's words. "I will work harder, and this field will bear brilliant fruit again!"</p>
<p>They parted ways at the wharf.</p>
<p>The February wind blew through Liu Family Village, and Fu Sheng's farming tools were completely devoured. There were no more songs in the fields, and the strong men grew fewer and fewer. The entire Liu Family Village was finished!" Only then did he sigh, and pack his belongings into a purple cloth bundle.</p>
<p>As he approached the wharf, the boatman was yawning under the sun. When he saw clearly that it was Fu Sheng, he patted him on the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Going to get rich? The wild winds outside are strong, do you know A'gen?"</p>
<p>Looking like a mad dog, the boatman punched Fu Sheng hard on the back:</p>
<p>"Hmph! Joined the bandits! Offering your heads as targets for foreign guns!"</p>
<p>Then he collapsed again:</p>
<p>"My boat, ah!" The boatman cried.</p>
<p>Fu Sheng had lost consciousness. He stood blankly in the February spring wind, listening to the cuckoo's "cuckoo" cry flying overhead.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Street Scene <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Gang</p>
<p>In the eastern corner of the Forbidden City, there is a Japanese military camp where strong men often practice shooting or drilling. People who live nearby or pass by often stop and stare as if it were a circus, holding down hearts filled with a bit of terror.</p>
<p>To the east of this military camp is a small alleyway where people of various nationalities live.</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be without its masters – the Chinese. The rest are too numerous to count: Japanese, Americans, British, French...</p>
<p>Foreign company signs are everywhere. Foreign words are painted on the white walls. Some foreign companies have their front doors on the main street and their employee dormitories here. The Japanese mostly hang small wooden plaques with their names on the side of the door, while people of other nationalities mostly nail engraved brass plates on the door.</p>
<p>You won't see towering skyscrapers of dozens of stories. Apart from Chinese-style houses with large gates, there are only small and exquisite two- or three-story foreign-style buildings. Beijing is not like Shanghai, where land is worth its weight in gold.</p>
<p>In these houses, you'll see foreign gentlemen with chests puffed out and bellies protruding, carrying sticks. Their suits are crisp and stiff. Even the Japanese men are all wearing short, stout suits. Only a few Japanese women stroll on the streets in kimonos, and even then, to feel more comfortable and avoid being noticed, they often wear Chinese cheongsams, with only their eyebrows and hairlines revealing their origins. Proud white-skinned women walk in and out of the doorways. Rickshaw pullers gather around, hoping to make a sale. As soon as those feet in pointy high-heeled leather shoes step onto the rickshaw pedal, they dash off. Rickshaw pullers greatly welcome foreign customers, partly because they are greedy for a relatively generous fare (of course, they can't forget the harsh kicks of leather boots), and partly because they are happy to take advantage, muttering a few words under their breath.</p>
<p>"Foreign women are all like they have children, everyone wearing a fur coat inside out!" A self-proclaimed knowledgeable person says:</p>
<p>"Didn't you see the daughters begging in X Hutong!"</p>
<p>However, there doesn't seem to be any poverty in this alley. Instead, in the empty corners of high walls, there are often small, narrow houses that are less than six feet long, with an earthen pit laid horizontally. Moldy clothes and scraps are piled up in the daytime. These are where the Chinese coolies live – even worse than coolies, just some old men with no job and no support. They stare all day long at the foreigners coming and going from their open doorways, feeling as if they never had a youth, and sighing softly. These small mud houses leaning against these foreign buildings and mansions are truly the best contrast.</p>
<p>You're sure to see a rented car or automobile every three minutes. Those riding in the cars are often white people or Japanese people with large families, but the ones pulling the rickshaws and driving the cars are always Chinese. However, the narrow alley has not become a wide alley, and the street with five inches of dirt has not been paved into a smooth asphalt road. When a car approaches you at night, its bright headlights will illuminate the uneven bumps and dents that are hard to see during the day. As the car passes, a layer of dust flies up half a丈 high, drawing dark curses from pedestrians.</p>
<p>The servants of the residents often stand at these doorways, mostly clean and tidy, and able to speak a few words of pidgin English. Neighbors nod from afar, leisurely chatting about trivial matters. Standing in front of them are short-tailed foreign dogs. The foreign dogs don't seem to distinguish nationalities and always obediently listen to the shouts of the yellow-faced servants.</p>
<p>Chinese maids with neatly combed hair and faces also appear at the doorways, holding either blue-eyed, blonde-haired, or children wearing small kimonos. The women speak stiff foreign languages, but the children often adapt and speak short Chinese phrases.</p>
<p>Children aged five or six to seven or eight, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, often play together, building a sandpile or displaying some toys in front of the door. Boundaries disappear among the children. Yellow hands will hold white hands, and blonde heads will rest on the shoulders of black-haired heads. Sincere breaths come from many small throats.</p>
<p>But people have also seen that when a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old Chinese boy slightly bumped a foreign child while riding a bicycle, more than a dozen foreign children of similar age immediately chased after him, shouting:</p>
<p>"Hit, hit!"</p>
<p>Is it the inspiration of age?</p>
<p>Looking back at those Kuomintang foreign barracks, one feels indignant.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Mr. Juqing (Two) <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing, over sixty years old, has a wide forehead and a sharp chin, and his facial features resemble a precise triangle: equilateral. A few gray and white whiskers, which don't look very dashing, float on his lips. His eyes are deeply sunken into his cheeks, like two holes. Because he is so small and thin, the gray patriotic cloth sheepskin robe and the black velvet mandarin jacket look particularly bulky. His demeanor and attire clearly tell you that this old man has a history full of vicissitudes.</p>
<p>Yes, everyone in town knows that Mr. Juqing was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations during the Qing Dynasty, had official titles, and was the most knowledgeable tutor in the entire town. Everyone recognized and acknowledged him as such. Moreover, he was surnamed Kong, from a family with a long scholarly tradition, and said to be a direct descendant of Confucius. However, this descendant of the sage is now deeply worried about the reefs ahead of his educational career.</p>
<p>Looking at the few eight or nine students at the Confucius memorial ceremony on the first day of school, he couldn't help but recall the grand occasion of his disciples being like clouds.</p>
<p>Mr. Juqing has been setting up a private school in the town for at least twenty years, sitting on a "cold bench."</p>
<p>Every day teaching "The Master said," "The Book of Songs said," "Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li," accompanied by children often covered in tears and snot, watching bodies swaying like pendulums to the left and right on each desk, ears filled with buzzing sounds of reading, vermilion pens, tracing characters, books, textbooks… These monotonous days are not easy to pass. It can be seen that Mr. Juqing's twenty years have been spent in the midst of this.</p>
<p>Although the life of a teacher is pure and noble, it seems to be a dead end for scholars. In the beginning, how could Mr. Juqing have thought that he would inherit the sacred mission of setting up a school and teaching students?</p>
<p>In his youth, Mr. Juqing, like other scholars buried in their studies at the time, had dreams of wealth and fame swirling in his mind. Because his family was not very well off, he keenly felt the warmth and coldness of human relationships. Thinking of the many impoverished and destitute young masters in unofficial histories and novels, he found that his own situation had many similarities. Therefore, he often expected that his future would be like "a branch of apricot blossoms red for ten miles," bringing glory to his ancestors. Unfortunately, such a beautiful dream was finally shattered along with his withered youth after a dramatic change in the times.</p>
<p>A large number of days passed in an unpleasant state.</p>

<p>The Western League soccer will end in April. Tung Wah has won all ten games, and the championship seems to be no problem. There are six games remaining. Two games will be played today and tomorrow, leaving only four. Tung Wah only needs to win four of the six games to win the championship with twenty-four points. You You has two games remaining. After today and tomorrow's games, they will be finished. The team currently has eighteen points. Even if they win both games, they will only have twenty-four points. Western Police has three games left and currently has seventeen points. By the end of the season, they will have at most twenty-three points. Moreover, Western Police is playing Tung Wah today and You You tomorrow, so their chances of victory are extremely slim. Furthermore, with Tung Wah's strong team, it will not be difficult for them to win all six games and maintain their undefeated record. Therefore, the championship is already in their grasp. Today, Tung Wah plays Western Police at 3 PM at Shen Garden. Western Police is declining and cannot withstand a single blow. Tung Wah should be able to secure a victory. In another game, You You plays French Business at 3 PM at Yih Garden. That game should be a tough battle.</p>

<p>The Public Exhibition Cup handball competition has been held for six sessions. The first to fourth session championships were held by Western Youth. The fifth session was won by China Youth. This session is the sixth competition of the cup. The members of both teams are very average, so it is difficult to predict who will win. Through three rounds of great effort, the Chinese finally managed to preserve the championship. In the first round, the Chinese won 6-7. In the second round, the Chinese suffered a crushing defeat 5-10. At the critical juncture of the third round, both sides fought with all their might. The battle was very exciting. The Chinese unexpectedly defeated Western Youth 9-6, winning this session's championship, which is very gratifying. In terms of physique, the Westerners are tall and strong and hit the ball very fiercely, winning with courage. However, the Chinese are petite and exquisite and completely win with skill, avoiding the heavy and attacking the empty, avoiding the edge, which is the only method by which China Youth can overcome strength with softness. If the members of China Youth can work harder to increase their strength, it will not be difficult to show good skills in international handball competitions in the future.</p>

<p>(9) 43-15 victory over Minde. At 9 PM on the 3rd, the team played against the Minde team at the Ipoh Jingwu Sports Association.

In the end, the team won 30 to 18.</p>
<p>In addition, the team won many games. Except for the defeat to the local overseas Chinese men's team in Saigon, the team won all the remaining games. The team members were able to achieve this result despite the fatigue of the journey, which is still commendable.</p>
<p>Track and Field Confrontation Wins</p>
<p>It is calculated that the team also made three track and field performances during this Southern Tour, all of which were victories. Chen Shuqing created a new record of 13.4 seconds in the 100 meters, which is quite valuable. Deng Yinyan of Ma-Hua has excellent results. If she can continue to work hard, she will definitely stand out at the National Games and be able to compete with domestic athletes.</p>
<p>Men's Basketball Team Firmly Invited and Politely Declined</p>
<p>In addition, the ports of Nanyang appreciated the outstanding achievements of the women's basketball team and eagerly hoped that the men's basketball team would also come south to compete. They repeatedly invited and telegraphed from Shanghai to send players to start the journey so that they could return to China with the women's team after the competition. However, due to the fact that the school has already started and the round trip takes time, it is feared that it will hinder the students' studies, so we had to politely decline and thank you. We will wait for another day.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the gold market closed, with everything changing. Banks struggled to cope, driving intense buying pressure. Overseas calls indicated that the London spread had narrowed to 0.0625 recently and 0.125 remotely. It was said on the ground that after the market closed, the listed price still had sellers at a low of 0.0625, with a few transactions still taking place.

London spot gold narrowed by 4.5 pence, sterling against the dollar rose by 1.25 cents, the dollar against sterling rose by 875, sterling against the franc rose by 19 pounds, and the dollar against the franc remained unchanged. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices: sterling at 1 shilling 7 pence, and the dollar at 38 yuan. Compared to the previous price, sterling was flat and the dollar was slightly looser by 0.0625, mainly because foreign exchange was still long. After the opening, spot sterling immediately tightened to within 7 pence. Although the Dalian group dumped a large amount of Dalian currency, the sentiment was extremely positive, and banks lacked selling appetite, causing the process to tighten. The HSBC listing was announced, with sterling narrowing by half a penny and the dollar narrowing by one yuan. Chinese merchants and silver companies had even stronger buying intentions, and the process tightened further. Although banks plugged the gap, it was limited, and extremely narrow, with sentiment even more active, and extremely tense. The Dalian group continued to dump Dalian currency in large quantities, allowing banks to cover their foreign exchange positions, gradually trending towards stability. The gold market gray market also retreated from 892 yuan to 888 yuan. Although there was still some struggle afterwards, the buying side had already become sluggish, and the afternoon session turned rigid, with the gold market gray market also falling to 82-83 yuan. The market was maintained by banks taking advantage of the cheap prices. Bombay also had calls for electronic purchases, and it remained tight. Indian silver initially reported a decline of 11.10 annas, and the process tightened again. Sassoon also had buying intentions, with banks offering truly expensive supplies, and multiple bids in the process, making transactions difficult. Later, Indian silver rebounded by one anna, and the situation turned mediocre, with the gold market also rising to just under 90 yuan, and then falling back. Qiao Zhifu and Nissin had some selling appetite, and the final trend stabilized, with the closing price for recent sales being sterling at 1 shilling 6 pence 625, and the dollar at 37 yuan 375. Compared to the previous close, sterling tightened by 375 and the dollar tightened by 5625. The forward market was even tighter, mainly because the swap spreads were squeezed open. Chinese merchants squeezed in, and the Dalian group dumped a lot of Dalian currency. The day's trading record is as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, May futures started trading. Only the 1921 Rehabilitation Bond failed to open. All other varieties were fully opened in the first round of trading in the morning. There was considerable arbitrage and swap trading in the market, and there were quite a few people who went long on the forward market. Trading suddenly became active, mainly because Sassoon advocated for gold-backed bonds, the atmosphere of British borrowing suddenly became strong, the domestic silver standard could maintain its original state, the currency would not expand, and the financial relief for the market had a solution. With a good environment and rising sentiment, if this current situation can gradually become a reality, the bond market will not be difficult to achieve rapid development. Yesterday's experience was the best in the first round of trading in the morning. Numbers 4, 21, and the Northern Group all had considerable progress. In particular, the stamp tax rose the most, by 60 cents, and Renmin Bonds also rose by 30 to 50 cents. Only Number 21 fell by 5 cents due to the sale of Number 20. The market trend was completely exposed in this first round. Afterwards, the ups and downs were limited. For example, the front row was small and the back row was large in the second round, and the front row was large and the back row was small in the afternoon opening. There was little difference. The closing was generally slightly weak, but it was only 5 to 10 cents to 20 cents higher or lower. In terms of trends, it can be temporarily stabilized. As a result of market prices, except for May, which was newly opened, the market price in April had uniformly risen by 10 to 20 cents to 60 cents compared to before the settlement. The total turnover was 14,675,000 yuan. The rise and fall results are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>U.S. Railroads Suffering Huge Losses The New Hong Kong Trading Company reported yesterday (28th) that the New York stock market showed a downward trend under the leadership of railroad stocks. This was because the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company wanted to borrow more money from the Finance Construction Company and intended to reorganize its capital structure. Also, according to private estimates, first-class railroads suffered operating losses of 40 million yuan in January and mid-February. Belgium ordered all exchanges to temporarily suspend operations this week, which was recognized as solid evidence that the Belgian franc was about to devalue, causing it to plummet by 100 pounds. The bond market was affected by the Belgian situation. Small exchange stocks were still flat, and wheat fluctuated, reflecting the unstable stock market situation. The total volume traded was 610,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The yarn market is still in a calm situation. Although the U.S. and Indian cotton markets have fallen, the exchange rate has narrowed, and the sentiment is still good. Moreover, current yarn transactions are still sustainable, so the market has not changed. Because the yarn auction is handled at the end of the month, the market is closed for one day. Current yarn customer purchases totaled 400 bales, and the market is flat. The purchase amounts of each customer are as follows:</p>

<p>The March futures Jinji auction yarn was launched on October 1st of the previous year. The first bid price was 178 yuan and 40 cents, and it soon fell to below 174 yuan. Until October 18th, due to the increase in export tax on silver, the sentiment was stirred, and the market price soared, creating a peak of 190 yuan and 5 cents. At this time, the bullish sentiment was extremely enthusiastic. Tongcheng and Tongji companies unanimously absorbed silver high, and there were rumors about paper money in the market, so it hovered between 187 and 8 yuan for three or four months. Later, during the Chinese New Year, money houses fought each other, and extreme panic occurred in Shanghai's finance. Bullish sentiment was disappointed, and sentiment was frustrated. The bullish positions of Yongcheng and Tongji were successively closed, and the gold price plummeted. The silver market soared, causing speculation. The market continued to fall. The lowest closing price before the market on February 26th was 176 yuan and 40 cents. Mr. Bo frequently purchased and added positions at this time, and there were rumors of organizing a bullish company, and the market price gradually rebounded to above 180 yuan. Unexpectedly, on March 12th, U.S. cotton plummeted by more than 100 points, and the market was suppressed again, falling below the 180 yuan mark. It was delayed until recently, and large investors prepared to take delivery, showing signs of resilience. The last bid was 183 yuan and 9 cents, which was 9 yuan and 4 cents higher than the final bid price in February. As a result, 6,980 bales remained, all of which were settled by themselves. The consignees were all a certain magnate, and the delivery price was 181 yuan. The brokerage numbers and bale amounts of the receiving parties are listed below (unit):</p>

<p>The March futures cotton was launched on October 1st of last year. The first bid price was 34 yuan, 50 cents, and it fell to below 33 yuan. On October 18th, the National Government increased the export tax on silver and added a balancing tax. Prices soared across the board, and the cotton futures market peaked at over 38 yuan and 50 cents. At this time, general cotton merchants and cooperatives were very enthusiastic about hoarding. Yongcheng and Tongji bought in large quantities and absorbed vigorously. Rumors of currency inflation in the market were often rife. It hovered between 38 yuan, 50 cents and 60 cents for four months. Later, this spring, cotton mills were weakened, and there were often cases where they could not maintain operations, reduced working hours, and stopped work. The need for raw materials was reduced, foreign exchange was released for a long time, silver rose sharply, and the amount of cotton stored in various locations became thicker and thicker. In Shanghai, there were more than 100,000 pieces of cotton in real cotton stocks. As a result, the market showed instability. Yongcheng and Tongji companies, in view of the deteriorating environment and financial decline, first cut off the long positions with pain. Yongcheng also turned short from long, and the situation became more and more panic. Unexpectedly, it rained again overnight in the leaking house. On March 12th, U.S. cotton fell miserably by more than 100 points, and it was difficult to support the cotton market history. At the same time, banks and certain cotton merchants, etc., in view of the surging world trend, sold short in the cotton futures market. It was delayed until recently, and although delivery was not smooth, no one was receiving the goods. The lowest price broke through the 33 yuan mark to 32 yuan and 80 cents. As a result, 7,300 loads remained. The last bid price was 32 yuan and 80 cents, which was 1 yuan and 70 cents lower than the final bid price in February. The delivery price was pulled to 33 yuan for three days. The goods were Huoji Yaohua totaling 1,200 loads, and the rest were all settled by themselves.

<h3 id="e199">European Political Turmoil Frustrates U.S. Cotton <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market opened. Due to the uncertainty of the European political situation and monetary system, foreign merchants sold off, and long positions were closed. The Liverpool telegram was unfavorable, and Secretary of Agriculture Wallace stated that he was unwilling to abolish the procedural tax, causing each month to fall by 21 to 24 points. Then, the market price recovered due to purchases by the same industry and short covering. The spot cotton base is strong, and there are not many sellers, and the selling trend is blocked. However, the buying side is also quite timid, and there is little speculation outside the industry. The market is calm, and prices fluctuate. The textile industry has seen some activity, and the closing is stable. Spot fell by 10 points, and futures fell by 11 to 21 points. British cotton spot fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 1 to 3 points. Indian cotton was weak due to the impact of the unfolding political situation in Belgium. Pingguo fell by 3.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 3.5 rupees, and Baijixi fell by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 28th):</p>

<p>The flour market was first flat and then rose. The quotation for foreign wheat was about 10 to 20 cents lower in Chicago, and 8 points lower in Canada. Therefore, when the market opened, the price of foreign wheat was small, and the weather had cleared, so the opening prices for each month were 1 point to 1 and a half points lower. After the second round, the short-term positions were hedged, and the market sentiment stabilized. The trading volume for each month in the forward market turned light, and the market showed a stable situation. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for each month showed a government rebound. This month, because it was close to the final transaction, the general short-term positions had to be covered, so the market was boosted sharply, and there was a state of squeezing shorts. When the third round was at its highest, it reached 4 corners 2 points and 5 mils, because the customer long positions were taking delivery, and the situation felt serious. Although there was no market for gold in the forward market, the gray market rose by about 20 yuan, so the sentiment stabilized, and it also brought a lot of gains. As a result, this month rose 3 points 2 mils and 5 silks, April rose 1 point 2 mils and 5 silks, May rose 2 points 2 mils and 5 silks, June rose 1 point, July rose 7 silks, and August rose 2 mils and 5 silks.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the buying interest was silent and the selling interest surged slightly. July and August were about 2 to 3 points lower than the previous day. Although April had opened, there was no change in the market. When the market opened in the afternoon, the transactions in April were still light. The market in July and August was first weak and then rose. The flour market rebounded, and the current month also created a short squeeze. The gold market continued to rise in the gray market, so the sentiment was good, and the market rebounded by 3 to 4 points. Looking at the situation after this, because the exchange rate is volatile and the weather is also unpredictable, the future feels very unpredictable. As a result, July was better by 2 points, and August was better by 1 point. The current wheat market, because there is not much arrival stock, customers are selling, and high-priced goods have risen by 2 to 3 points. Shandong wheat opened at 3 yuan 7 corners, followed by 6 corners 9 points. Yaowan wheat opened at 3 yuan 4 corners 6 points, totaling 1,000 bags, which were handled by Fuhsin.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from each gang were unable to arrive in full due to wind resistance. The number of ships arriving at the port dropped, only totaling No. 4 (with a total of nearly 800 piculs of goods). The former market was completely without a market due to horizontal winds and heavy rain. Yesterday, there were two other markets, which were still sluggish, making it difficult to revitalize the overall situation. The high-priced paddy rice was still stable due to package prices (more than 400 bags were handled by Tianjin, Weihai, and Heng). The middle-priced rice fell by some points, and various thick japonica rices were similar. The Yinbian Yuan rice also fell by some points due to the lack of sales channels.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from He Xia. White japonica rice had normal sales, and thin paddy rice was sluggish. Although there were not many Yangjian rice arrivals, there were also few recipients. The market price of white japonica rice was stable, thin paddy rice was weak by a few points, and Yangjian rice was short by nearly a corner. The rest were stable.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Yesterday, the foreign rice situation was quite prosperous. Because it was rumored in the market that the tax on foreign rice would be increased by 25% from next month, the sentiment was quite excited, and the sales of mainland gangs were even more prosperous. The Yangtze River Gang continued to handle goods, and the total transaction volume of spot foreign rice reached more than 20,000. The sales route was particularly active for the Hankou Gang to purchase small quantities, so the small quantities rose sharply by 6 to 7 points, and other varieties rose by 3 to 5 points. The subsequent situation is still in a promising stage, because digestion is gradually becoming active, and sentiment has turned positive. The guest currency is also welcomed by the mainland. Yesterday, 1,183 bags were opened, and the price also followed up by several points.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was buoyed by the impending tax increase and the Sugar Industry Cooperative's decision to halt bidding due to the Huanghuagang commemoration. With sentiment already positive and demand strong, the price surge intensified. The guild's quotations for Guangdong coarse white sugar and French coarse white sugar both reached $17.95 per unit, an increase of $0.55 to $0.35. Offers for 24 coarse white sugar reached $18 but were not fulfilled. Taikoo Sugar's B-mark sugar for immediate delivery saw 5,500 bags sold at a price of 3.375 Dutch guilders per bag. Local refined white sugar producers, facing a sudden surge in raw material costs, hesitated to sell further and refrained from quoting prices. Qing sugar prices, which had already risen the day before, saw foreign sugars rise by about $1.30. Consequently, quotations for local sugars also tightened. A total of 1,000 bags were offered yesterday, with superior Qing sugar priced at $10.81, a $0.2-$0.3 increase; washed Qing sugar at $10.60, a $0.2-$0.3 increase; Huanggang Qing sugar at $10.30, a $0.1-$0.2 increase; semi-South Qing sugar at $9.67, a $0.1-$0.1 increase; and Long Qing sugar at $9.56, with a similar increase. In addition, Hong Kong merchants offered over a hundred bags of high-grade sliced Qing sugar at $9.60, a $0.3 increase. (Corrections: In yesterday's sugar market report, the "Dutch" character in "Dutch coarse white sugar" and "Dutch Fuy sugar" had an extra red mark below it. Also, the "unit" character in "per unit" was mistakenly written as a similar character. Both are urgently corrected.)</p>

<h3 id="e203">Testing Low-Frequency Amplification Circuits <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>When radio repairmen encounter a completely silent radio, the first step is naturally to determine where the problem lies. (Within the rectifier, low-frequency amplifier, intermediate-frequency amplifier, detector, or high-frequency amplifier circuits.) The simplest test method is usually to lightly tap the grid of each vacuum tube (starting from the last tube and moving forward). Listen carefully for popping or buzzing sounds in the speaker. If tapping the grid of a particular vacuum tube produces no sound in the speaker, it indicates that the circuit or vacuum tube is damaged.</p>
<p>While the above testing method is convenient, the confined space and numerous components within a typical radio make it difficult to reach with one's fingers. Even if accessible, it is easy to touch other high-voltage circuits, often resulting in an unexpected shock.</p>
<p>Using a low-frequency oscillator (A.F. Oscillator) to test the low-frequency amplification circuit is, of course, the most thorough method. However, such specialized equipment is expensive and typically reserved for experts. Ordinary amateurs, who prioritize economy, find it difficult to acquire.</p>
<p>Recently, I came across an article in an American radio magazine about a method for testing low-frequency amplification circuits using the alternating current hum from an electric light. It is indeed a novel and practical idea, which I have translated below for fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>As shown in the diagram, take a length of floral wire and connect one end to a power outlet. Connect the other end in series with a 0.0005 MFD fixed capacitor capable of withstanding high voltage, and then connect it to a test prod. (The test prod resembles a regular mechanical pencil, with the upper part made of insulating material and the lower tip a conductor, as shown in the dotted box in the upper left corner of the attached diagram.) During use, first plug the wire into the electric light outlet and turn on the radio. Then, touch the test prod to the plate and grid of the power amplification tube (as shown by dotted lines 1 and 2 in the diagram). If a humming AC sound is heard in the speaker, it indicates that the final-stage low-frequency amplification circuit is intact. Repeat this process, touching the plate and grid of each vacuum tube in sequence until no AC sound is produced in the speaker. This will identify the location of the damaged low-frequency amplification stage.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Knowledge for Beginners <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xuelun</p>
<p>Instructions for beginners on assembling radios have already appeared in various issues of this publication, so there seems to be no need to repeat them. However, a close reading of previous articles reveals that most focus on the assembly of single-tube radios. Given the current variety of vacuum tube types and numbers, there are also many circuit diagrams. Even when there is a description of vacuum tube selection, it is often vague, leaving beginners confused and uncertain. Therefore, I am using this space to share some advice for fellow beginners in radio.</p>
<p>Those who study radio typically start with crystal radios and, after some time, find their efficiency too low. They then upgrade to single-tube, then two-tube radios, and so on. However, due to a lack of sufficient knowledge, purchased vacuum tubes and components are discarded, and circuits are repeatedly modified, wasting beginners' money and time. I have organized my findings into a systematic account so that beginners can avoid groping in the dark and feeling lost.</p>
<p>(1) Power Supply: The most important and first issue to resolve when assembling a radio is the power supply. In prosperous cities, most power plants supply AC electricity, so it is best to use an AC power supply. Although the initial investment is slightly higher, the ongoing expense of DC batteries far exceeds the electricity bill for an AC unit. However, AC power is drawn from high-voltage currents, so caution is advised for those without significant knowledge of electricity. I suggest that beginners start by assembling a semi-AC radio, paying close attention to the primary two-wire terminals and avoiding touching them. Once sufficient experience is gained, then try assembling a full AC radio. In remote towns and cities, or places where power plants do not supply daytime electricity, a DC power supply is preferable.</p>
<p>(2) Vacuum Tubes: Vacuum tubes hold a primary position in radio, so after deciding on the power supply, the next step is to select the type and number of vacuum tubes to match the power supply and other components to their characteristics. Although vacuum tube manufacturing in Europe and America is constantly innovating, with more and more tubes being produced, each has its specific function and cannot be interchanged. Therefore, expansion should be considered from the beginning of assembly to avoid discarding initially purchased tubes. After research by myself and other amateurs, the most economical and durable vacuum tubes for DC are 30, 32, 33, 34, and for AC are 36, 38, 39, 77, 78, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e205">Improved Earphone Magnetization <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhui</p>
<p>A demagnetized earphone loses its effectiveness. Various radio publications often describe methods for magnetization, typically involving briefly touching the two terminals of the earphone to the positive and negative poles of a high-voltage source to restore its magnetism. However, my experiments have revealed areas for improvement, which I will describe below.</p>
<p>My Erpees earphone (made in Germany) has been used for over two years, and its magnetism has gradually diminished. Following the aforementioned method, I briefly touched the two terminals of the earphone to the positive and negative poles of a B battery. With a click, the magnetism of one side of the earphone was very strong, but the other side completely lost its magnetism (both sides were originally balanced). I then reversed the terminals and touched them again, with the opposite result. In short, I could only fully magnetize one side at a time. I then unscrewed the Bakelite cover of the earphone, removed the steel diaphragm, and unsoldered the terminals of the A and B wires, connecting them to longer wires (as shown in Figure 1) to magnetize them separately (if ineffective, reverse the two ends of the wire). This allows both sides of the earphone to restore their original magnetism, avoiding the aforementioned problem.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Diode Triode Vacuum Tube Voltmeter <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Chongling</p>
<p>(Continued from issue 106)</p>
<p>If we want to measure the maximum value of the input AC voltage, we can insert a variable battery E in addition to the fixed C battery in the grid circuit of Figure 1, and connect a DC voltmeter V to it to measure the negative voltage of E, as shown in Figure 3. When there is no voltage input, the value of E should be zero (that is, the voltage indicated by the V voltmeter is zero). At this time, there is only a negative voltage C in the grid circuit, and the MA ammeter only shows a small amount of current. If there is a voltage input, the plate current will inevitably increase. Therefore, the grid negative voltage E can be increased until the plate current returns to its original value (that is, the plate current when there is no voltage input). At this time, the voltage indicated by the V voltmeter is the increased negative voltage in the grid circuit: the value of this negative voltage is equal to the maximum value of the input voltage. Therefore, the voltage measured by V is the maximum value of the input voltage.</p>
<p>(2) The grid-detector vacuum tube voltmeter uses a grid-detector circuit, as shown in Figure 4. Cg is the grid capacitor, Rg is the grid leak, C is the bypass capacitor, and E is the balancing battery. Since this circuit does not have a C battery in the grid circuit, when there is no voltage input in the grid circuit, the plate still has a considerable DC current. The voltage of E can be increased to reduce the current of the MA ammeter until the DC current shown by MA is exactly zero. If an external voltage is input to the grid circuit, the plate current will inevitably change, and the voltage of E will lose its balancing effect. Then the changed plate current flows through MA, and the pointer of MA will turn to a corresponding position. The current shown by MA can measure the value of the input voltage.</p>
<p>The grid-detector vacuum tube voltmeter is more sensitive than the plate-detector type for measuring low AC voltages, but it consumes more power, and the plate current is quite large when there is no voltage input. Therefore, the grid-detector type is not as good as the plate-detector type unless extremely high sensitivity is required.</p>
<p>In general, the vacuum tube voltmeter is superior to the ordinary voltmeter in the following two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Its own power consumption is extremely low, so measuring the voltage of a certain circuit with it will not disturb the current of this circuit.</p>
<p>(2) If the bypass capacitor of its plate circuit is configured properly, it will be independent of the frequency of the measured voltage. Therefore, a vacuum tube voltmeter calibrated with low frequency can also be used to measure high frequency voltage.</p>

<p>Five years ago, a certain university professor said, "Once the examination system is implemented, qualified people will have food to eat." But today, that statement is not necessarily true. A certain important person put it more bluntly, saying, "What qualifications? One word from me is the qualification."</p>
<p>Ms. Pan is only nineteen years old this year! Once, she was discussing women's liberation with a friend. She said, "...Do you know how to interpret the two words 'liberation'? Liberation means breaking free from the constraints of the old morality, and absolute freedom in all actions. Parents should not interfere with women communicating with members of the opposite sex, or falling in love. Society should not criticize or denounce them. This is the true meaning of 'liberation'!"</p>
<h3 id="e208">Sketching from Life <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>In ancient China, painting and writing were one and the same. A character was a painting, and a painting was a character. Later, painting progressed and progressed from realism to symbolism. The Song Dynasty painting academy used poetry as themes, leading painters towards artistry, and sketching from life was no longer valued by painters. By the Qing Dynasty, the Four Wangs focused on landscape paintings. Fortunately, there was Yun Nantian, who created a new path and showed his genius in realism, competing with the Four Wangs and reviving sketching from life in China.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sketching from life did not receive the promotion of connoisseurs, and successors were few, and therefore still regarded as a minor art. In modern times, the world trend tends towards realism, and sketching from life has risen again. We have several painters in Suzhou who can express their artistic essence, such as Cheng Yaosheng, who has left Suzhou for Shanghai, is a representative. Chen Jia, who is still in Suzhou, and his disciple Liu Junran, can carry on his legacy. Jia's sketches are not only lifelike, but also his compositions are lively and innovative. Recently, he finished a painting "Chicks under Flowers." Half of the painting is a rose, full of vitality, and the other half depicts seven chicks, downy, lively, symbolizing a kindergarten. This painting was exhibited in the Zheng She Capital Painting Exhibition and received much praise. Later, Mrs. Chen Bijun bought it for sixty yuan. Now Jia has repainted it, even more charming. He also painted "Purple Wisteria and Ducklings," depicting the poetic warmth of the spring river, and having the same mystery as Weng Xiaohai of Wujiang a hundred years ago. (Weng was best at sketching from life and was known as Weng Turtle.) Junran's paintings of flowers, fruits, and vegetables are also unique. It is said that the teacher and student are going to exhibit at the Literary Society in Shanghai and Hankou. Such sketches with scientific mind and literary skill will surely return with glory.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to report a news: Cheng Xiaoqing, famous for the Hawthorne detective cases, is also Jia's star pupil, and will have "Fish Pleasure" and plum blossom feathers, etc., as embellishments for novelists' paintings, or will be especially appreciated by people.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Liu'an Tea <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Teabowl</p>
<p>It is said that tea is extremely addictive, and those who like to drink tea will become addicted. I am one of those who are addicted. I did not drink much tea before, but now I am madly in love with it, and I can't do without it every day!</p>
<p>But my love is exclusive: I only drink Liu'an tea, not other teas: Wuyi, Qimen, Longjing, Dongting... Although I have had love affairs with them, the result is that the whole of me is occupied by Liu'an tea. No matter what tea it is, I don't think it has the taste of Liu'an tea, nor is it as gentle, handsome, soft, spicy, and coquettish!</p>
<p>I often compare ancient beauties to tea. Liu'an tea is as beautiful and as unfortunate as Wang Zhaojun. Liu'an tea, except for a very small amount sold in northern Anhui, is almost entirely sold by the Shandong gang to the northern provinces. After they transport it there, they use jasmine to make scented tea, completely covering up its original appearance. The way northerners drink tea is even crueler. Large teapots are famous. They stuff handfuls of leaves into the pot, pour them into large bowls, and drink them. It's like Wang Zhaojun talking about the love of cohabitation with a foreign king with a beard like a halberd, which is the same thing as burning a zither and boiling a crane!</p>
<p>Occasionally, Liu'an tea also comes to the South, but the southerners are used to being fascinated by Longjing tea, which is like Xi Shi. Who cares about Wang Zhaojun! Probably the Liu'an tea that comes to the South, although not fake, is all inferior. I can't buy really good Liu'an tea in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Really good Liu'an tea, one flag and one gun, color, aroma, and taste, are all above Longjing. Especially "Ban Zhen," after being slightly boiled, the fragrance is sweet and fragrant, how can it not make people drunk for three days? Back to the topic, tea is like a woman, Longjing is a yarn-washing girl; Biluochun is a miss; Ban Zhen is a dignified, mature young mistress; if you are a sick Sima Xiangru, and really want to relieve your thirst, you must pursue the young mistress, right?</p>
<p>Work hard! To level the bumpy road of this world.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11: A Sad Nighttime Conversation About Life Being a Dream; Footprints Scattered, The Wind and Rain Too Deceiving</p>
<p>But finding that position as a concubine isn't something you can jump into. You still have to run to Little Western Paradise for a few months first. This young lady from my hometown, she saw her sisters all doing it this way. What was there that she couldn't do? Suddenly, she also caught the disease of going to Little Western Paradise. You have to give her credit, though. In less than half a month, she had new clothes, leather shoes, and a watch. Someone took her to see Shaanxi opera. She was almost to the point of riding in a private mule cart. It was then that she met a male compatriot who took her to Kaifeng for half a year. It seems that male compatriot didn't want her anymore, so she had to return to Shaanxi. But having been to the East, she was even more modern. She needed money for herself, and her family needed money, so she had to run to Little Western Paradise again, using her body to exchange for money. But her husband's family was a conservative family. How could they tolerate this? So they broke off the engagement. Although she hadn't returned to her old home in Jiangnan, she had been to Kaifeng, which was several times more prosperous than Xi'an. She knew how comfortable it was to be a concubine in the East. She used to think that riding in a private mule cart with a uniformed servant was a big deal, but now she knew that it was nothing to boast about. But even though she looked down on people in her heart, she still had to humor those who looked down on her in order to have food to eat, clothes to wear, and an opium habit to satisfy. That's how I am. But I thought about it, and I absolutely couldn't continue doing things without shame. To be honest, selling your body is selling a little bit of beauty, selling a little bit of youth. I'm getting older every day. It's getting harder and harder for me. If I keep humoring them, I'll definitely starve to death in Xi'an and won't be able to return to my hometown. Speaking of this, her voice choked again, as if she couldn't go on. But she immediately thought that it was meaningless to cry to people all the time. So she stood up to pour tea, offered the guest a cup, and drank a cup herself, changing the subject and moving on.

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The residence occupied by these silk-making artisans is not small. Generally, it consists of a central main hall with two rows of side halls on both sides. As for the carved beams, painted pillars, and flying pavilions, they are exactly the same as the rest of the place. Such a spacious and magnificent workshop can be said to be rare in the world, no wonder the girls are so happy that they forget their homes! They work in the central main halls during the day and return to the side halls of the two emperors to rest at night. Their lives are extremely orderly.</p>
<p>Now let me briefly talk about some of the official silk-making procedures. The reeled raw silk is sorted into skeins, then washed and dried in the sun, and then dyed in various colors. Dyeing is certainly not done once; it must be dyed two or three times before finally being taken out to dry in the sun. Near the side halls where they live, there is a stone flat, which is where the silk is dried. When drying the silk, many bamboo tripods must also be used; their height is not very high, because if they are too high, the girls will not be able to reach them. In the middle of every two tripods, there is a very smooth bamboo pole; the dyed silk is hung on it in skeins to dry, but things are not that simple! At the beginning of drying, the direction of sunlight must first be observed. The silk cannot be half exposed to sunlight and half not exposed to sunlight. After a considerable period of time, they must be turned over or moved to ensure that the time they are exposed to light is very uniform, so that the color of the silk will not be dark in one part and light in another.

<p>— Yin Er</p>
<p>Since the premiere of the New Women's Film, the Fengyang songbook has been almost universally sung, depicting rural bankruptcy, chaos, famine, making people unwilling to sing, and whether Fengyang is originally a good place is also worth studying. According to Fengyang, formerly known as Haozhou, the Fengyang government was established at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty followed it and belonged to Anhui Province. The Republic of China abolished the government and kept the county, and it was governed by the Huaisi Road of Anhui. Recently, I read Gu Danhu's (Danwu) Xiaoxia Xianji excerpts, about the situation in Fengyang in the early Ming Dynasty, knowing that the Ming Taizu wanted to prosper Fengyang but could not get it. Taizu originally rose in Fengyang, because he thought it was an auspicious place, so he worked hard to govern it, but after the chaos, there were few people and the land was barren, so he moved 140,000 wealthy households from Jiangnan to fill it. Those who returned privately were punished. He also set up egg households, fishing households, and teaching workshops, etc., and imprisoned the sons, grandsons, wives, and daughters of ministers of enemy countries and sent them all to the teaching workshops, entering the Pingkang Courtyard as prostitutes. These are not the ways to cultivate the original intention. According to legend, wealthy people who wanted to return to their hometown to visit their tombs would often disguise themselves as beggars, men and women, and secretly return to worship. They would go in winter and return in spring, which became a custom, and they had to go when the time came, which was far from the original intention of visiting the tomb.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Lament for Ruan Lingyu <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— (Xuan)</p>
<p>The moth-brow weeps, composing a song of a toothless rat, shaming the spring heart falling between two homes. Knowing that she died because of love, her grave will not grow a mimosa flower.</p>
<p>Grief and fear, like a drama, vex the beauty. It is said that she was smart but stubborn. She has taken away all the romance, but still leaves the tears and smiles in the world.</p>
<p>A Call to Laughter</p>
<p>— (Qingyun)</p>
<p>Because laughter is, after all, an expression of joy. Even in tragic circumstances, perhaps because of the mixture of knowledge, the power of sorrow becomes even more deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Like Charlie Chaplin's comedies on the screen, the endless laughter contains profound sorrow, much like drinking a strong cup of coffee, the bitter taste felt at the end. However, precisely because of this bitter taste, people can feel excited and feel that this laughter has a deep and long taste that can be chewed on! The following are a few examples of jokes.</p>
<p>Expensive Brush and Ink: A scholar in the past wrote characters that were like earthworms crawling and meaningless, but he thought they were like dragons and snakes dancing, with a unique charm, and he actually shamelessly started a career as a calligrapher selling characters for a living. He knew that his own characters could scare the vulgar but could not deceive the knowledgeable, so he had a brilliant idea. His fees specifically promoted the brush and ink he used, such as Song Dynasty wolf hair, Ming Dynasty goose pen, and so on, with many names. As for ancient ink, there were even more names and expensive prices. One day, this great calligrapher, in order to promote himself, specially wrote a pair of couplets and asked a famous contemporary person to comment on them. That famous person looked at his handwriting and then looked at his fees, and unhesitatingly inscribed five large characters: "Expensive Brush and Ink."</p>
<p>Awarded to Me: When Emperor Qianlong visited the Lion Grove Garden, he was overjoyed and wrote the three characters "Really Interesting" in imperial calligraphy. Fortunately, his minister Gao Shiqi was tactful and asked for the word "Interesting." This ungrammatical inscription did not taint the scenic spot. In the midst of organizing scenic spots and promoting scenery, a group of gentlemen who were fond of elegance would also occasionally make the "Really Interesting" joke with their enthusiastic inscriptions. In the midst of organizing Tiger Hill, a famous person proposed the four characters "Ancient Wu Overlooking the Scenery" for the front gate. An editor of a certain newspaper felt that the word "Overlooking" was "awarded to me" and wrote two other words "Scenery" and "Traces" for exchange, asking him to change it to "Ancient Wu Beautiful Scenery" or "Ancient Wu Historical Traces."</p>
<p>Progress of Learning: There was a scholar in the past who took a fancy to a wine-selling daughter. He wrote many rhyming love letters and sent them one after another, but it seemed like a stone sinking into the sea, with no reply at all. It was not until the scholar became lovesick and was dying that his servant wrote a letter full of typos and sent it. Only then did the daughter rush over that night. The scholar received it and, in joy, asked her why she had not come the previous times. The daughter smiled and said, "The previous letters you sent were unreadable, and I knew your learning was still not good! Today's letter is completely clear at a glance, how can it not make people feel pity and love, so I hurried to see you." The scholar listened and was so angry that his eyes straightened and his feet stiffened, and he died.</p>
<p>I Am the Only One: When a certain literary figure was lecturing on the stage, he criticized the famous writers of ancient and modern times one by one, saying that they were all worthless. At this time, a student listening to the lecture became angry and stood up and asked: You said that ancient and modern writers are not good, so the best writer is naturally only you, sir? The literary figure listened and nodded frequently and said, "Indeed! Indeed!" At this time, there was a burst of enthusiastic laughter from the audience.</p>

<h3 id="e214">A Gentleman Keeps Away from the Kitchen <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was confined in the "Old French School" to study ancient books, reciting without explanation. Therefore, I failed to grasp the meaning of various "aphorisms" and "quatrains," passing over them vaguely. Later, I regretted it deeply, but I still thought of catching up quickly. I often flipped through the large-character woodblock books and was willing to study the sayings of the ancients. Over time, I inevitably gained some understanding, but what followed closely behind the understanding was still confusion and wonder, which was extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>For example, I recently came across the saying "A gentleman keeps away from the kitchen," which made me ponder it quite a bit. According to the meaning in the books, it says that a gentleman has a sense of compassion. He cannot bear to hear the cooks and stewards slaughtering and killing in the kitchen, and the miserable cries of those chickens, sheep, and livestock when their necks are spurting blood. Therefore, he sits a little further away to avoid feeling depressed and losing his joy. The problem is originally very simple. However, precisely because it is too simple, it easily stimulates my brain.</p>
<p>It's not that I have any aversion to the humanitarianism of the "gentleman keeps away from the kitchen" faction. What I want to ask now is, who makes the killing and harming actions in the gentleman's kitchen happen, who causes them? I think a cook or steward would never slaughter a pig for no reason if the master didn't eat meat. Moreover, according to research, it was rare for ancient gentlemen not to eat meat. So, if they ate the meat, why couldn't they bear to hear the sound? You are determined to shoot your enemy to death, but you still proclaim that you cannot bear to see your enemy bleed. What kind of talk is that! Thinking like this, ancient gentlemen were good at pretending everywhere, good at wearing masks. The so-called humanity is just a layer of sugar coating on a poisonous pill.</p>
<p>However, is it only ancient gentlemen who are like this? Aren't today's gentlemen the same? Their faces are hypocritical, their methods are clever, and they often shout at the top of their lungs: "I universally care for all beings, I passionately love peace, I will always be a good person..." But in their two hands, one is a mixture of sugar and anesthetics, and the other holds the sharpest butcher knife. Or, they themselves are engrossed in the work of a cook. When you become the meat on their chopping board, they open their bloody mouths wide: "Haha, you just didn't make enough effort." After swallowing you in one gulp, they are still gentlemen, and they will still say: "I cannot bear to kill and harm." In fact, they are still standing at the door of the kitchen.</p>
<p>Perhaps humans are born with a talent for deceiving, and at the same time, humans willingly accept deception, dying without complaint. Otherwise, why has this kind of deceptive trick like "A gentleman keeps away from the kitchen" become even more intensified today?</p>
<h3 id="e215">Passing Through the Xiamen Strait by Boat <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Kong Ming</p>
<p>As the ship was about to enter the Xiamen Strait, it was restrained from afar by the continuous mountain range. The ship slowly crawled forward, and on the waves reflecting the sky, fishing boats hoisted their giant sails in groups, fluttering on the sea. When they got close to the ship, the fishermen's dark faces and strong arms could be clearly seen. In the distance, the ridges of the mountains were illuminated by the sun, fully revealing their blue and bright faces. In some mountain recesses, the villages formed by the fishermen were hidden by deep green trees, forming small piles of shadows.</p>
<p>Seabirds followed the stern of the ship from the distant sea. Once it entered the strait, the flock of birds gathered more and more. The stern of the ship stirred up a long strip of white waves on the sea, and the light blue surface was full of white foam. The flocks of birds forever stared at these white foams with hatred in their eyes. Then, they suddenly plunged into the sea with their sharp beaks, and immediately lifted up a fish, slowly swallowing it into their mouths. After that, they continued to soar behind the ship, constantly spinning around, without feeling tired at all, until the sound of the ship's engine stopped.</p>
<p>From the first time I saw the mountains of Xiamen, the water journey to Xiamen and Gulangyu was not very short. I kept seeing mountains and the sea, which was restrained like a river. It took two hours to reach Xiamen. The ship initially went around the back of Gulangyu. As soon as I saw the white lighthouse building in the daylight, the dense Western-style houses of Gulangyu appeared. The colors were exceptionally bright and neat, and when they were set off by the green trees and reflected in the sunlight, the beautiful island floated up from the sea. The scenery felt very beautiful, and the passengers all leaned out to stare at the beautiful island.</p>
<p>The ship turned around from the back of Gulangyu, and the front view was presented with an even more majestic and beautiful face. The houses were even more densely packed and stood even taller? Many red brick walls, matched with dense windows, directly confronted Xiamen. Looking at the situation, it really seemed like imperialism was constantly provoking China's gateway - Xiamen?</p>
<p>Then the city of Xiamen showed itself in a new posture. On the coast, a long row of tall Western houses stood completely with white walls. As the ship approached, the signs of ×× Foreign Company or ×× Hotel waved at the travelers with large letters. In the gaps between the large houses, the streets spewed out their big mouths. The rumbling of cars and the ringing of rickshaws were all transmitted from the air. And the noise of the city was刺着travelers' nerves again.</p>
<p>When the night boat docked in Xiamen, the lights of Gulangyu twinkled from the mountainside, as dense as the stars in the sky. The sounds of Xiamen were exceptionally noisy. Compared with the tranquility of the opposite shore, it was like dividing into two worlds. In the evening, the sound of small boats rowing could be heard everywhere, occasionally mixed with one or two whistles, brushing through the water space, which really made people feel as if they were in the water village of Venice!</p>
<p>The moonlight was reflected on the water, and the sea was filled with a white light. The lights of the small boats were as lonely as fireflies, and compared with the electric lights on both sides, they were like fireflies compared to kerosene lamps.</p>
<p>The next morning, the ship departed from the Xiamen Strait again. Slowly peeling away from the shore, the small burdens of the vendors all slipped off the ship, and the shouts of hawking disappeared. The beautiful scenery of Gulangyu gradually faded from sight, the ship stirred up a long strip of white foam on the sea again, and the seabirds flew in groups again, forever circling behind the ship.</p>
<p>After bypassing Gulangyu again, it was restrained between the two rows of mountains. I didn't know how much time had passed until I slipped out of the sea off Dingguang, and the seabirds had disappeared unnoticed.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Return <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The night after receiving a letter from a friend saying he was returning to Shanghai, my old classmate of seven years unexpectedly and quickly visited me. In joy and surprise, we shook hands tightly, speechless for a long time, as if we were mutually understanding the comfort of loneliness: just like when we lived together before.</p>
<p>After we graduated, I quickly found a position in an office, but he, on the contrary, ran into walls everywhere. Like a pure young man who had just stepped out of the school gate, he deeply felt disappointment. He almost lost his ambition to progress. At this time, I set up a berth for him in my cramped upstairs room, and he slept on the bed all day, without thinking, as if this was the meaning of his existence. When I returned home after work, I saw his blank face – and also felt that my own profession was precarious, so I couldn't think of a word of comfort or encouragement. This lonely life extended until he entered his uncle's compradore firm.</p>
<p>Originally, this was a very good path, but perhaps because he was a university student, he didn't think that eating required shortcuts other than his knowledge. I remember after finishing his first day of work, he told me that if it weren't for his uncle's sincerity, he would never want to do this kind of mechanical thing. He felt that society was not at all what he had imagined in school. It was opening its poisonous mouth to devour every young and pure heart! But his experienced uncle, after seeing through his disappointment, used the entire commercial textbook to teach him, so that he could understand the art of eating.</p>
<p>Under the influence of this kind of learning, valuable new phenomena also unfolded in our cramped room. If life can be divided into two segments, we had stepped into another class to experience life.</p>
<p>A year later, his uncle bought a branch factory in Huaibei, and he took on the important responsibility of monitoring the actions of the factory manager and separated from me. This was in the winter of the year before last.</p>
<p>At first, I often read his letters. He told me many of the folk customs and living conditions in the north. He said that there was the society of his dreams. He wanted to work hard and repay his uncle for giving him the opportunity to be a person again. I rejoiced that my old friend had a good opportunity, and all the words I hadn't thought of before were conveyed to him in the letters.</p>
<p>After last summer, his letters became sparse, or were just short greetings. He wanted me to send more Shanghai publications and a newspaper – there was no second newspaper in the entire county besides the police station – to relieve his loneliness. So I ran to Sima Road for two days and ordered three publications for him, and selected a dozen books that could be read – the ones I thought were a little better on my bookshelf – and sent them to him one after another.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, he returned to Shanghai. I received the date of his arrival in Shanghai and went to the station to meet him, but a young man who had gone to the ideal society to work hard had completely changed, he had become an insensible shell. He cried, his efforts had been wasted in the techniques of petty merchants, and he had spent the last few months living a life of prostitution and heavy drinking, so that he would not commit suicide. But he didn't want his uncle to know, so he returned to Huaibei in tears this spring. For three months, I haven't received a second letter from him besides one saying he arrived safely on the road.</p>
<p>This time, after our unexpected return and meeting, the first sentence he said to me was: "I'm unemployed!"</p>
<p>Naturally, this fruit had matured before it bloomed. It was the ending that a university student who wanted to adapt to the environment with the textbooks from school deserved. This society is exactly the opposite of what we imagined! If you don't want to dye yourself into a multicolored cloth, unemployment will forever follow you like a shadow!</p>
<p>I looked at his insensible face and swallowed the words that were surging in my throat.</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Drunkard Ma Sanzi <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Chunyun</p>
<p>The fire pot-like sun quietly sank behind the rubber plantation in the west. The wind swept in gusts from the rubber plantation, mixed with a bit of the rubber's fragrance, stinging people's nostrils.</p>
<p>At this time, the workers in the rubber plantation, laughing and joking, received the reward for their day's labor from the accounting office. They seemed to have forgotten the fatigue of the day's work, forgotten the dirt beads oozing from their black charcoal-like faces, and forgotten the upper half of their clothes that had been soaked through with sweat, as if they had been lifted out of the water, dripping with water. They walked in groups into the Yongxing "local boss"'s tavern, forgetting everything, and happily drinking three or five cups.</p>
<p>The Yongxing "local boss"'s tavern was opened on the right side of the rubber plantation. The customers in the tavern were naturally the workers in the rubber plantation. The tavern was about two zhang wide, and so low that you could touch the roof with a hand. The roof was made of "attap" leaves. When the wind swept over, it made a rustling sound. There were also two tall palm trees outside the tavern, like two flagpoles standing tall, but they lacked the two wine flags fluttering above.</p>
<p>Every day, when the sun sank behind the rubber country in the west, the Yongxing "local boss"'s tavern's business became prosperous. Yongxing "local boss" stood in front of the counter, waving a fan in his hand, sticking out his bulging belly, and greeting customers with a smiling face. The tables inside the tavern were occupied by many workers who were as black as ghosts, drinking wine and talking loudly about the novel news that had happened in the rubber plantation.</p>
<p>Ma Sanzi, with a face full of honeycomb-like spots, staggered out of the rubber plantation. From a distance, Yongxing "local boss" greeted him. He was also one of the tavern's main customers, and he had to come to the tavern every day to drink three or five cups.</p>
<p>When Ma Sanzi's shadow flashed in, many workers inside, as soon as they saw him, grinned and made faces at him, saying in a mocking tone:</p>
<p>"Ma Sanzi, did the foreman give you more wages today?"</p>
<p>"Of course! Letting your wife sleep with the foreman, how could you not get benefits?" another person chimed in.</p>
<p>"Ma Sanzi, ask her to sleep with us once, will that work?" Then, everyone in the tavern laughed.</p>
<p>In this kind of situation, Ma Sanzi really didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He wanted to make trouble with them, but it didn't seem to make any sense, and if things got out of hand, it would be like opening a toilet lid in the wind, the stench would spread even further, which wouldn't be worth it; but silence was close to showing weakness! In the end, he also answered with a semi-humorous tone.</p>
<p>"I have never put women in my eyes... you fuck your mother, what's the problem with sleeping with you once!" Then he raised his hand and heavily knocked his fist on the table. "'Local boss'! Come on, a plate of dried fish and two catties of white wine." It seemed that in this way, the pent-up anger in his stomach would be completely vented.</p>
<p>While Ma Sanzi drank the wine, he was very unhappy in his heart. Although his mouth kept saying "I don't put women in my eyes," it was a kind of shame for him no matter what if a woman slept with someone else! He poured the wine cup after cup into his stomach, two catties passed and then two more catties were added, until the "attap" roof was spinning, and his eyes were full of red threads, like two red balls, and the wine glass was too heavy to lift, before he staggered out of the tavern door.</p>
<p>When Ma Sanzi staggered to the door of his home, his woman ran out from inside, supporting his rough arms and saying:</p>
<p>"Oh dear! You went to drink again, and you're so drunk!"...</p>
<p>"Bitch! You did a good deed, I won't let you off today!..." His anger, which had been闷in his stomach, swelled up again when he saw his woman. He grabbed her short hair and delivered many heavy slaps like raindrops.</p>
<p>Then, his woman cried哇啦哇啦. But he fell to the floor and slept soundly, like a pile of mud.</p>

<p>Xun Kao Shu pushed the respect for his parents as the respect for the ancestral temple. He certainly would not dare to fight for the chariot in the Grand Palace. 推事親之肅. 为军旅之肃.必不敢挟赖于大逵矣. Only because he cannot promote it, he initially obtained the name of pure filial piety, but in the end, he could not avoid the warning of urging his parents to be in danger. Or said, Kao Shu's attack on Xu, took the lead with lightness, could it also not promote his filial piety? Said, fighting for the chariot is private. Not filial. Taking the lead is public. Filial. Loving his body is filial piety to his parents. Forgetting his body is loyalty to his monarch. How can loyalty and filial piety have two first principles? Zeng Zi considered war without courage to be unfilial, then Kao Shu's courage is exactly what Zeng Zi called filial piety. However, he did not die from the injury of taking the lead, but died from Zidu's shot. Dying in private and not dying in public. This is why I deeply regret his inability to promote it. In the past, Zuo Shi once cited.孝子不匿.永锡尔类. poems to praise Kao Shu. Looking at it from now on, being able to舍肉but not able to舍车, then his filial piety will sometimes be lacking. Being able to化庄公but not able to化子都, then his class will sometimes not be able to be锡. Kao Shu 三复is a poem. Can not be ashamed?</p>

<h3 id="e222">Recollections of a Famous Soviet Film Seen Six or Seven Years Ago <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Ang Ge</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's International Film Festival has opened. China has also selected seven famous films to participate, and Ms. Hu Die, along with Ambassador Yan and Mei Lanfang, have traveled to Russia. Therefore, people's attention has turned to the Soviet Union, especially its films.</p>
<p>This reminds me of several Soviet films I saw six or seven years ago. At that time, I followed my father and lived in a small town in Latvia near the Soviet border. We often saw Soviet films.</p>
<p>The first film I saw, and the one that still leaves an indelible impression, is a tragic film called "A Country Girl from Liangshang Province."</p>
<p>The protagonist of the film, the country girl, was played by the Soviet actress Trecha Ersajia. The background is a typical Russian farm.</p>
<p>The plot is as follows: A peasant family in Liangshang Province, a father and son, live a very happy life. There is a young girl in the village, and both father and son like her very much. Eventually, the son and she fall in love and get married.</p>
<p>But not long after the wedding, the son is drafted by the revolutionary government to participate in the domestic war. He is gone for three or four years, and there is no news from him during this time. The father at this time rapes his daughter-in-law, and coincidentally, the daughter-in-law becomes pregnant.</p>
<p>The relationship between father-in-law and daughter-in-law is forced. She still expects her husband to return. However, her belly grows larger, and a son is born. What can she do? She feels mental pain and cries day and night. Fortunately, her sister-in-law treats her well and comforts her.</p>
<p>Finally, the war stops, but the son did not die on the battlefield. He happily returns home. He imagines all the way: his father will shed tears of joy when he sees him; his beloved wife will certainly kiss him, maybe scream hysterically, and tell him the story of the past few years with mixed feelings of sadness and joy, which will naturally be the happiest.</p>
<p>When he gets home, ah! The situation is not as he imagined. The family is silent when they see him return! The father, with a guilty conscience, coldly runs away. The wife is holding a child in her arms. When she sees him, she only looks at the ground, silently shedding tears.</p>
<p>He understands, is disappointed, and is resentful. Without saying a word, he beats his wife. What can the wife say in this situation? Bearing the pain of body and mind, she runs out of the house. It is very lively outside, and the villagers are having a festival to enjoy themselves, but this only highlights her loneliness. She sits alone on a rock by the stream, blankly, her eyes full of tears, and the wind blows, raising her soft black hair; she also sprinkles drops of tears into the flowing water at her feet. When the tears are gone, she jumps into the deep stream.</p>
<p>People clamor: the son is also awakened from his pain by this sound and runs out of the house. Neighbors have already placed the dead woman by the stream. Her black hair is scattered, and her beautiful face is as pale as wax; but it is also shining brightly. The son cannot help but kneel down, holding the corpse and crying bitterly.</p>
<p>The onlookers are all around, and the old women are busy making the sign of the cross and praying to God. The honest farmers are all shedding tears of sympathy for this bizarre tragedy. After a while, the son raises his head and sees his father standing in the crowd with tears in his eyes, his face full of regret and shame. At this time, the son's face shows an unspeakable hatred!</p>
<p>The plot is so gentle and profound that it has won the tears of countless infatuated men and women. I have seen it for six or seven years, but as long as I think of it, I always feel a slight sourness in my heart! No wonder this film has been playing for many years and still has the ability to draw crowds.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e223">Review of "Murder in the Clouds" <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Chan Fei</p>
<p>Murder in the Clouds</p>
<p>— Grand Theater</p>
<p>Generally, detective films cannot be separated from thieves and police. The thieves are vicious and also clever and cunning, but in the end, they cannot escape the hands of the police. When they fall into the net of the law, the wicked will naturally be punished. As mentioned above, this is almost the formula for general detective films, and "Murder in the Clouds" is no exception. As for the male protagonist succeeding and love being fulfilled, it is also a necessary insertion in general mediocre detective films.</p>
<p>For such a vulgar film, we have almost nothing to say. Such a formulaic plot structure is probably familiar to those who often watch films.</p>
<p>The positive side here is naturally to advise people not to be robbers, but the opposite effect is that the large-scale organization and equipment of the robbers are a terrible temptation for those who take risks. Of course, we are not saying that there would be no robbers without films that teach robbery. The scientification of robber activity is a characteristic of modern society. But in the end, there is inevitably something close to piracy, although the screenwriter's original intention is to vigorously promote the strictness of the national police organization and imply the security of American society.</p>
<p>Because of the strong stimulation, filmmakers regard it as a way to make money. Under this intention, "Murder in the Clouds" uses the transportation of military supplies by plane as the main scene. The sound of planes and the sound of bullets are dangerous and terrifying. However, because the director and performers are mediocre and incompetent, they did not achieve as good results as they expected. As for pointing out which scenes are better and which places are bad, it seems redundant. Frankly speaking, this film cannot make people feel much interest, it is just a mediocre work.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Review of "Pirate Treasure" <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>"Pirate Treasure"</p>
<p>—— Carlton Theater</p>
<p>This is a film with an extremely long story, and other than the thrilling performances of fighting, fleeing and chasing, falling and jumping, there doesn't seem to be anything else to it, a martial arts film.</p>
<p>The aviator Dick announced that he would go to a certain island to excavate the pearls buried by his ancestors. A lawyer, Black, heard about it and sent a group of capable subordinates to steal Dick's treasure island map. Then, following the stealing and grabbing of this map, the protagonist Dick fought back and forth with this group of people, fighting a big battle.</p>
<p>The whole film has seven or eight long scenes of fighting, mostly Dick fighting with his bare hands and single-handedly against a large group of people. He is free to come and go in the air and in the water, and his skills are so high that people can't help but exclaim "amazing!" and have the feeling of ancient Chinese swordsmen. But what is unbelievable is that Dick, as a nationally admired aviator, aviation, often accompanied by famous ladies like Miss Dorothy, and also consulted with Captain Carson on important matters, is a famous figure, how can he always be entangled by the people sent by the bad lawyer and engage in the business of seeking wealth and killing lives? How can he not alarm the government? In broad daylight, Dick was knocked down from the fifth floor, and the police maintaining order only lightly patted him on the shoulder and let him go on his own. The sailors sent by the dignified captain to be Dick's guards were beaten like straw men, and the wharf and train became battlefields, without any interference. Unless this world is only for them to fight! "If you overdo it, it's not a play!" Someone in the audience was saying this.</p>
<p>Let's put these aside for now, and follow the producers to watch them fight. Frankly speaking, the fighting scenes in the film are not handled very well. It's always a matter of bumping around like bulls, and the tricks of falling from high places and the sea, climbing, and jumping off cars have lost their so-called thrilling fun due to the overuse of the old-fashioned tricks. What's more, the yellow car escaping, the black car chasing, the white steamboat escaping, and the black steamboat following, as shown on the screen, are lengthy and repetitive, making people feel a little bored?</p>
<p>The director's poor skills are not limited to this. For example, in the whole film, there are seven or eight places where the bad lawyer and his subordinates communicate by wire and wireless telephones, and the scenes of connecting and disconnecting the calls in these seven or eight places are exactly the same as the original. After Dick escapes from danger, in the emergency and turbulent scenes, there is always such a stagnant and slow conversation like Miss Dorothy or others. And in the conversation between two or three people, when writing about the other side's progress at the same time, no matter how much is written, when returning to the original scene, everything remains the same.</p>
<p>If there is anything good to say, it is the costume drama inserted in Dick's dream when his ancestors buried the treasures. The short scenes and the steady performance add a lot of color to the whole film.</p>
<p>This is the first episode, and we hope there will be a good show in the next episode.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Casual Talk on "The Secret of the Chateau" <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Cheng</p>
<p>"The Secret of the Chateau". As the name suggests, we can imagine what a mysterious film it is.</p>
<p>In the castle, there is an old bell suspended in a tower. No one has ever rung it, and no one ever goes to this bell tower, but there are rumors that the bell will ring on its own, and on the night it rings, an unfortunate death will befall someone in the castle. Just imagine, what a strange tale this is?</p>
<p>With such a strange tale, someone took advantage of this opportunity to carry out his scheme. One day, the bell suddenly rang on its own, and the people in the castle were terrified. Sure enough, someone died that night, and a very valuable ancient book hidden in the castle also disappeared. Then, while the detectives were investigating this strange case, the bell rang again, and someone died again... How terrifying! But unfortunately, the cunning assassin carelessly revealed his identity, and the mysterious massacre was solved in a very tense situation.</p>
<p>The male and female protagonists of this film are played by Clark Wiuiam and Claire Dadd, and it will premiere tomorrow at the Great Shanghai Theater.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Hate of India's Fall (Clive of India) (14) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>When Clive heard this news, he immediately returned to England with Edmund. This time when he returned, there were no cheering crowds on the shore, no welcoming personnel, and even Margaret didn't come! He quietly disembarked, went ashore, and returned to his old house in Queen's Square. That was his first residence, where his first child died... Cold and alone... Just like he is now cold and alone. Edmund sent Clive to the residence in Queen's Square and immediately ran to Wallcott to see Margaret, wanting to mediate between the couple.</p>
<p>But Margaret's heart was already set. She adopted an attitude of indifference. She neither hated nor forgave, as if it didn't matter to her. Edmund earnestly pleaded, "You can't just throw him aside like this. He still has to deal with his enemies in the House of Commons. He needs your help, comfort, and encouragement when he is being tried. If this matter is messed up, his family and life will be over. Now is the critical moment, how can you let him go it alone?"</p>
<p>Margaret said, "He is alone because he wants to be." Edmund said, "Maybe he is too proud to come and see you first." Margaret said, "Edmund, I have sacrificed so much. If he is proud, can't I be proud too? However, when you see him, please give him my regards." Edmund angrily said, "You have been married for so many years, and you are still talking about pride?" He said, bowed deeply, and left.</p>
<p>In the evening, the British House of Commons was already crowded with people, with no room to set foot, to listen to this sensational trial. Margaret, led by Captain Clark, was taken to a dark corridor with a window where she could hear everything in the House. She trembled all over and listened quietly as Sullivan stated that Clive's property was all illegally obtained. He advocated that his property be confiscated and that he be punished. She also heard Johnston say that all the abuses of patents in India were caused by Clive. He also pointed out that Mir Jafar's gift was a bribe. She also heard Bogoraine describe in a funny tone the shape of him signing the treaty in the name of Admiral Watson, and said that a despicable person who forged a signature would never refuse a bribe.</p>
<p>All the attacking speeches were over, and the applause gradually subsided. Robert Clive stood up to speak. Margaret listened even more breathlessly. Clive spoke in a calm voice, "Mr. Chairman, all the words attacking me have been said. I cannot answer each and every one of them. If someone is doing things in society, you can distort all his actions to attack him. But I have one sentence, that is, everything I have done is to do my best for India, for my country..."</p>
<p>His voice became even louder, "In today's vote, you can take away everything from me, property, titles, and reputation... Just as India has taken away everything I love..." Margaret, in the dark corridor, couldn't help but take out a handkerchief to wipe her tears... "India has taken away everything I love..." She thought to herself, with her heart and mouth in agreement. Has she been too harsh? Isn't his leaving her for his duties? For the country? How can it be said that he doesn't love India? She couldn't help but feel remorse.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Movie Ramblings <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor will star in "The Farmer Takes a Wife".</p>
<p>Dante's "Inferno" has begun filming by Fox, directed by Havvy Lacbman, starring Spencer Tracy and Claire Trevor.</p>
<p>As a branch of art, film is said to have its own characteristics. It uses action to think and explain, and the efforts of the camera and the composition of montage are enough to make it exist as itself. But in essence, it, like other branches of art and even ideology, is a reflection of objective reality.</p>
<p>Since film art is essentially a reflection of objective reality, its content naturally flows from this fertile ground of reality. A certain content induces a certain form. Every picture has passed through the writer's mind. Therefore, the value of a work lies not in one aspect of its content or form, nor in the multiplication or accumulation of the two, but in the unity of everything in the two.</p>
