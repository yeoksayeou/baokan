<h3 id="c14">國貨捲烟業應亟謀自救 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>捲烟爲消耗品之一。原非日常必需之物。祇以嗜吸者眾。寖具普遍之勢。我國捲烟營業額。據稱年在二萬萬元以上。政府視爲稅源之大宗而直接間接資以生活者。人數殆亦無慮百萬。是捲烟業隱然已爲工商事業之中心。佔取相當重要之地位矣。</p>
<p>我國人自力經營之捲烟廠。向來屈居外商凌突之下。未能有鮮明之發展。自五卅案起。提倡國貨聲浪。甚囂塵上。國貨捲烟商乃得猛然抬頭。攫取時會。新廠則追踪崛起。出品亦琳珢滿目。在在有以徵騐當時氣象之勃興。顧以內部組織不醇。競爭方面龐雜。未經支持多久。復就委靡之途。迄乎去年。一部分廠家以發行贈品爲推廣銷路之號召。雖其勢已成强弩之末。一時亦頗收相當之效。迨今春政府實行取締贈品辦法。同時外商方面復削低售價。銳圖競逐。兼以市况不振。金融奇緊。一般購買力均形衰落。國貨捲烟商受此重重打撃基礎穩固者。猶能勉力相應付。資力貧薄者。殆難自全於崩潰。以言險象。誠岌岌哉。</p>
<p>國貨捲烟業在此偎持形勢之下。若不急籌自救。前途寗堪設想。吾人借箸代謀。認爲有須注意者三點。第一·在謀內部之充實。如提高烟質改良技術。維持信義。完密組織。均宜一一予以考量。而尤以維持信義爲根本之原則。溯國貨烟銷路所以不能與外烟相頡頏者。固由購買者未能竭盡維護國貨之力。而廠方組織不完密。亦儘以此招致外界之誤會。蓋一部分烟商。味於信義道德。難免有愉工减料情事。以致出品未能精良。或先優而後竄。或昨是而今非常人觀感所及。往往以偏概全。遂至整個國貨烟受其牽累。池魚之殃。寗不甚冤。補救之道。謂宜互相糾察。力矯前弊。放遠眼光。遵守信用。保持始終一貫之原則。以博取社會之信心。樹立永久之基礎。吾人敢謂將來之獲利。必有遠逾於今日者。第二。在盡正確之宣傳。烟質旣經提高。內省自可無疚。然接得放手以進行招徠之工作。唯官傳手段。務在力求正當。無論以巨幅廣告促人注意。或以提示方法助人記憶。要皆應以介紹本質爲範國。而切忌於題外做文章。如過去贈品辦法。利用國人好賭心理。其動機先已勿良。且宣傳一種出品。而至乞助於贈采。反使原來身分失其健全性。而平添有識者之疑靨。其爲不智。無待深論。至此項贈品辦法。所費亦復不貲。果能移作正當之宣傳。詎不較爲堂皇而有利。第三·在謀產銷之合作。國貨捲烟商旣已焦頭爛額於外商之競爭。而同業相與之間。又不免互懷虞詐。方面旣多。肆應自難。在此疲敝之局面中。與其交困而俱踣。何如合作以圖存。產銷一經合作。則彼此團結。無復顧忌。資金旣易周轉。精力亦可集中。而原應施於同業競爭之各項消耗。自可獲大量之贏餘。藉以補充生產之用。固不患無良好之結果也。</p>
<p>上述三點。皆爲國貨捲烟商自救之道。要在切能進行。以期漸登坦途。同時政府方面。爲體念商艱起見。誠應予以相當之便利。而吾人從推廣國貨着想。自亦樂爲充分之維護。如此交籌互策。努力不懈則國貨捲烟業之當前厄運。庶幾猶有擺脫之望乎。</p>

<p>繼續罷工　法租界人力車七千一百輛、車夫四萬人、自前晨罷工後、因交涉未有圓滿結果、同時發生流血慘劇、故昨晨仍繼續罷工、英租界車輛因被洩氣、故車夫均不敢南往、僅在法租界內拖拉、滬南交通、除電車公共汽車通達處所外、行人頗有無以代步之苦、</p>

<p>— 申報武廷琛</p>
<p>余生也晚。短短數十年間。物質變遷。不知凡幾。而以最近二十年為尤甚。即以捲菸而論。已不勝滄桑之感。淡巴菰流入中土。最遠不過三百餘年。當余幼時。輙見田夫野老。錈伏田間。人手一老竹根頭。根旁鎜洞。實菸其中。石火一敲。清烟一縷。工作餘暇。藉以逍遣。至於縉紳大夫。閨閣婦女。所用烟筒。或以銅製。或以銀製。上垂流蘇。下套繡袋。更見華貴。而水旱菸肆。因亦林立於市塵。此為土菸盛行時代。四十年前。舶來捲菸源源輸入。嗣後外商更在中國設廠製造。當時吸者。不過為好奇心所衝動。口銜一枝。聊示時髦。後以其攜帶便利。吸法簡單。流行愈廣。金錢外溢。論者以為不在雅片之下。社會熱心人士。亦曾有不吸捲菸會之設立。而潮流所趨。無法阻止。此為外菸暢銷時代。中國企業家見舶品捲菸不脛而走。必有大利可圖。亦遂設廠仿造。南洋剏始於前。華成繼起於後。五卅怒潮。中小廠家。更如雨後春筍。華菸勢力。不特充滿國內。且可輸出國外。華僑足跡所到。國菸即隨之而往。此為國菸全盛時代。外商見華商捲菸業之勃興。恐或碍其營業。恃其雄厚資本。運其外交手腕。一轉瞬間。華商廠家。漸呈不支之狀。過去二年。亦曾鈎心鬥角。別開生面。企圖掙扎。但終無補於衰微。殊堪浩歎。</p>
<p>或謂中國以農立國。而衣食原料。反有大量進口。據中國銀行二十三年份報告。是年農產品進口。遠三億三千四百餘萬元。其中米占六千五百六十餘萬元。棉花占九千餘萬元。麥占三千一百八十餘萬元。而子獨以無關民生之捲菸業為之大聲疾呼。無乃不類。吾謂上所列舉。係為天災人禍之後果。一旦農村恢復。或可望其減少。若捲菸業之衰頹。則以外商為對象。固非產銷方面加以研究。不能望其振興。亦非廠商單獨努力所能奏効。必也國人共同扶助。庶克有濟。須知捲菸一物。雖屬消耗品。而種菸者若干人。製菸者若干人。銷菸者若干人。其他間接以菸為業者若干人。一業之微。關係若此之鉅。國人之吸捲菸者。當其一枝在口。能默念其是否為國人所種。國人所製。茍為國菸。方始入口。則國菸廠商固已直接受惠。而菸農菸工亦可聯帶維持其生計矣。其在廠商本身。更宜听夕淬勵。時刻改良。則更不待論矣。</p>
<h3 id="c142">老牌烟嘴供狀 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 新聞報余空我</p>
<p>我這老牌烟嘴。在五年前是一個不吸香煙的人。三兩枝已經喉乾口燥。但是誰也想不到。現在我每天平均要七十枝一天。在熟識的朋友中。偶然談到吃香煙的數量。好像還沒有碰到了對手。沒有人超過我的成績。</p>
<p>平均每一枝香煙。耗費的時間以八分鐘計。一個鐘頭。只能吃上七八枝。大概我的普通狀況。每天有八九個鐘頭。圍繞在香霧騰騰之中。程度高到不喜歡用自來火。一枝接一枝的傳着火種。朋友們都能相信的。碰到我的時候。總看見我口啣烟捲。畫漫畫的朋友。或者認為這一枝煙是比我的眼睛鼻子任何一部份還重要。</p>
<p>這裏要說到我吃香煙程度。何以如此突飛猛晉。連我自己也莫明其妙。大概生活的苦悶是逼人吃香煙的最大原因。要說增進文思這些風雅的話。可惜。我這笨人。始終沒有理會得。</p>
<p>因為生活的苦悶而吸香煙的。大概不止我一個人。如此。所以要提起戒香煙的話。簡直是要呌我活活的悶殺。不過以我「老牌煙嘴」的經驗。覺得舶來品的香煙。有許多人因為他的價錢很貴。就「迷信」似的認為佳品。我是從頭到腳尖。根本反對的。我的理由。是香煙每天必需的米飯。決不能拿吃燕窩魚翅的心思來比較滋味的。在這樣不景氣的時候。「飯米」是無法不吃。要是魚翅燕窩這種不需要的消遣品。簡直可以不吸。</p>
<p>所以我以「老牌煙嘴」的立場。來奉勸吸煙同志們。足下如果並不需要吃烟。還是不吸為妙。如果同我一樣當茶當飯的非吸不可時。還是吸吸國貨香煙。固然提倡國貨。是國民應有的義務。而同時我覺得吃「飯」一定要吃外國「米」。你這個人根本就有點「洋」盤。或者就可以說是「奴隸性」……。</p>

<p>捲煙能振神志。助文思。故從事筆墨生涯者。類多嗜之。而余則嗜之尤甚。既嗜之。則自不能無所私。此余今日所以樂道此物之長。</p>
<p>吸捲煙更能避穢惡。解腥臭。祛煩慮。除悶損。享嘉賓。佐談興。為用之廣。固不啻必需之品。其有逆旅孤寂。永盡無聊。每當酒酣歌罷。飯後茶餘。燃煙一支。含味不盡。芬芳噴溢。四體皆舒。是則不僅文士之克獨佔。要亦人人之所同好也。</p>
<p>就我國今日之國民經濟言。吸捲煙之舉。本不應相與提倡。然惟其為經濟問題之故。國貨捲煙。大有令人不得不提倡之苦。蓋一則為求減少漏巵之計。一則為維持煙葉農民及製煙工人之生計計。非得已耳。</p>
<p>今日之中國。為一極嚴重的過渡時代。惟其如此。社會間一般現象。類皆充滿矛盾之姿態。捲菸之勸吸勸戒。要亦為其一端。但吾人以為苟能本諸葆愛國脈而提倡國貨之精神。以臨此機。宜存者何。宜推者何。人所共喻。更無煩喋喋。以言捲煙。則可得一結論曰。與其吸外國煙。無寗大膽提倡吸國貨煙之為愈矣。</p>

<p>本會宣告成立。二旬于茲。為擴大宣傳持以久遠起見。爰定八八為國貨捲菸節。並發行特刊。用壯聲援。仝人等忝為常委。　賣基重。值　令節。不能無詞。謹述一二。敢為全國同胞告焉。</p>
<p>慨自海禁既開。泰東西物品。流入中土者。則時俱增。捲菸亦隨此商戰怒潮。運銷我國。其後洋商。且設菸廠于滬漢及天津等處。儘量製銷。我國捲菸之營業權。悉為所操。迨乎清李。國人始稍稍注意於此。集資籌設菸廠。卒因經營乖方。設備窮陋。均告失敗。然而前仆後繼。曾不少餒。五卅而還。國人之投資煙廠者日眾。華廠營業。於焉勃興。挽回利權。殊為不淺。惟是華廠資力。類多薄弱。規模設備。又復簡陋。舉其全力。尚不能與外廠競。是以雙方營業上之比例。仍有喧賓奪主之勢。輓近以來。稅率屢增。負擔更重。且外迫于外菸之熱烈競業。內困于私菸之環攻交侵。華廠處此腹背受敵之境。殊已窘于應戰。其艱于維持者。多宣告停辦。屹然尚存者。凡四十餘廠。但因農村經濟之瀕于破產。社會金融之極度枯澀。並外煙之競業更烈。馴致華商營業。益形衰頹。宣告閉歇。又達數廠。雖倖而存者。亦減工停工。作輟靡定。奄奄一息。恐慌萬狀。以視往昔之蓬勃氣象。詎可同日而語。此中華國貨捲菸維持會之所由組織也。蓋華廠營業。既遠非昔比。設仍燕雀處堂。茍安一時。而不急謀挽救。圖其自全之道。則來日大難。方興未艾。勢將全盤崩潰。無復噍類。故不得不未雨綢繆。為此曲突徙薪之謀。使華商固有營業。賴以不墜。再接再厲。以臻于光明燦爛之域。斯由仝人等區區之微　也。</p>
<p>顧或者以捲菸為消耗品。而有所致疑。事固然矣。但就一般的社會現狀而言。捲菸需要。頗為廣泛。東西諸邦。亦均風行。英美兩國。且為著名產菸區域。每年輸出捲菸及菸葉甚鉅。佔有對外貿易之重要地位。是以政府從而提倡之獎勵之。以助長實業之發展。至乎我國產菸區域。所在多有。況外菸充斥市場。漏巵甚鉅。故于華廠營業。殊有維持之必要。然後鉅萬工人之生計。得賴以維持。各地菸農之產物。得賴以銷售。其間接以此為生者。亦得賴以無慮。更就實業幼稚之我國而言。華廠年納捲菸統稅數千萬。非微居實業界之重要位置。抑且為國庫之大宗收入。故雖為消耗品。攸關國計民生。固如是其鉅焉。</p>
<p>華廠處有重要地位。既如上述。惟所處地位愈重。斯所負責任亦愈鉅。我華廠同業。將何以自處。而盡此重大責任耶。要在互相團結。以鞏固其聯合陣線。勇往邁進。以博最後之勝利。不宜各自為謀。惟私是圖。授人以可乘之隙。致召各個擊破之厄。至于資金人才。宜如何充分運用。設備製造。宜如何計畫改良。出品成本。宜如何力求減輕。均應懲前毖後。詳加研究。至于原料。尤宜以身作則。儘量採用國產。俾整個的國貨業。于互相愛護互相提倡之下。以達共存共榮之目的。如尚為國產所無。而必購諸舶來品者。亦宜共同努力。發揮其創造精神。以解決一切困難。是則所厚望於華廠者也。</p>
<p>嗟乎。時至今日。國步維艱。水深火熱。正待其蘇。而世界經濟不景氣之潮流。又洶洶侵襲而來。我國受此鼓盪。固有產業。既感瀕危。新興工業。又遭打擊。其亟待設法維持者。初非捲菸廠一業而已。是以仝人等。不揣譾陋。茲茲前軀。今為擴大宣傳起見。爰定八八為國貨捲菸節。並發行特刊。大聲疾呼。以期喚起同胞之注意。而永留深刻之印象。甚望各業相繼組織。互為聲援。俾國貨營業。日趨發展。即此茁壯以長之捲菸廠業。亦不為惡劣環境所摧毀。斯尤不能不望于全國同胞。一致奮起共為維護者也。</p>

<p>一個人在煩悶無聊。或案牘勞形的時候。抽上幾支香煙。的確能尋到一點刺激和安慰。因此上香煙的銷路。是異常的好。</p>
<p>然而。輓近國人迷洋之心太甚。覺得什麽全是舶來品好。以為香煙亦是如此。你想這漏巵是如何的驚人。</p>
<p>其實近來國貨香煙是精益求精。煙味既好。價錢又非常道地。尤其在這不景氣的年頭。我們為什麽不購吸國貨香煙呢。何況。經濟的侵略。也是可以亡國的。我們大家應該。微盡國民之責。想法子挽回這個漏巵。</p>
<p>有人說。吃外國香煙。比較有一眼「台型」。真是喪心病狂之語。今後我們要大家提倡吸國貨香煙。而用舶來品為恥。</p>

<p>— 時事新報聶世琦</p>
<p>捲煙在現在真成了一種很時髦的物品。上至盛大的宴會。下至人力車夫。捲煙是很流行的。至於我們新聞界的人士。更少不了她。每每一篇文章或者編一兩則題目。非要抽一兩枝捲煙不可。否則。文章寫不出。題目亦編不好。交際場中。若不是捲煙在那裏連繫客人和主人間的情緒。恐怕也沒有那樣熱鬧。因為彼此空談着客套話。似乎很單調的。再如一個人獨坐或煩惱的時候。每每一枝捲烟在手。往往可以解決寂寞和煩惱。就是不吸。看看一縷縷的烟。也覺得有味咧。</p>
<p>我不是在勸人吸烟。實在據醫生的判斷，捲烟亦沒有多大害處。我們不見許多科學家學問家那個不吸捲烟嗎。不過中國什麽都喜洋化。連吸捲烟也非外國牌子不可。這真是一件大恨事。國貨捲煙。並不比外國貨差。而價目又比較便宜。何必把錢給外國人賺呢。以這樣行銷最廣的捲烟。還不能提倡用國貨。以防大損失。還談什麽別的呢。</p>
<p>做提倡國貨運動諸君。和愛國的諸君。這正是一個實行的好機會。我們提倡國貨。先從吸國貨捲烟着手。如我們的真正的愛國心。受了這種試驗而堅決起來。則我們一切都不須依賴外貨了。</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨界在今日，都是有些覺悟，覺悟的是什麼？是明白同業相殺，要失敗的，粗製濫造，更要失敗的；不講成本，閉門造車，尤其是要失敗。目下一致的希冀，是開拓出路。所以開展覽會，內地調查，西北考察，都是找尋出路的方法。不過國內市塲，以人禍天災的迭奏，國民的購買力，已到山窮水盡之時，與共跼蹐於國內，不如伸展到國外。所以國外貿易，也是目下國貨界的一條康莊大路。前天遇到張惠康君，知與國際貿易局所組織之中華工業國際貿易恊會，很想把國貨推廣到國際市塲。昨天肇基華行開幕，遇到沈肇基君，知沈君組織伊始，專爲各大國貨工廠推銷出品於歐美各國，很得外商的同情。上海已有許多國貨工廠，委託沈君經理推銷，沈君能以服務國貨界的精神，來替國貨界努力求出路，這是值得佩服與贊助的。</p>
<p>還有一事，最近國貨界熱心同志，組織了一個中華國貨捲烟維持會，以提倡國人吸用國貨捲烟爲主旨。當然做了中國人，應吸中國烟，世界上沒有一個國家的人民，肯汨沒了自己良心，去吸外國捲烟的。吾們做了中國國民，當然要吸中國捲烟，更應體諒這般熱心家的服務精神，以後不論敬人或自吸，一定要吸中國捲烟，纔對得起國家，對得起社會，對得起自己的良心。</p>
<h3 id="c153">關於「入超」 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>自從不景氣的巨浪，迅捷地侵襲到全世界之後，頓時引起了各國深深的不安；當然我國自也不能例外的同樣受到其影饗，社會上充滿着不景氣的情調！</p>
<p>不過外國的不景氣，是因生產增多，供過於求，中國的不景氣：却是因爲外受列强不平等條約的束縛，內受天災匪禍的相互交迫，以致形成工商落後，生產不足的現象。外人旣已洞察了這一點，所以就把過剩的貨物，盡量地輸入中國，換去了雪白的洋錢，减少他們不景氣的嚴重性，同中國卻越弄越窮，顯然地已造成了一個巨大入超的國家！</p>
<p>其實國際貿易上的入超，也是極普通的一種現象，入超的國家，也不一定即與其本國有害，至於有些反蒙其利的，那就須看入口貨品的性質而定了，假使入口的貨物，碟是機器鋼鐵等原料，那末雖則金錢同樣的流出，但是結果因此可以大量地增加生產和輸出，這類的入超，豈非反有莫大的利益嗎？</p>
<p>但是我們試一儉舉中國入超的貨品，大都是米糖，油類，布疋，化妝品，等類，完全是吃凈川光十足道地的消費品，絕對不能再生產以抵付入超的貨價；於是現金就不斷地流出了！</p>
<p>至於外國與外國國際間的貿易，那完全以平等互惠爲原則，以工業產品，換工業產品，以有易無，雙方有利。中國却除出以現金抵付外，至且輸出品也大都是粗率價廉的原料，外人一加改裝，又可倍值而售，結果仍是我們吃虧！</p>
<p>所以在這裏，我認爲我們不要以短視的目光，來斤斤計算入超與出超，我們爲了要發展實業，增加生產效率，外貨的生產工具，如鋼鐵原料機器生產設備等，正不妨多多利用，本來入超在發展生產時所不能免，反之原料大量的輸出，正也未許樂觀！同胞們！我們要把輸入的消費品，完全變爲直接問接的生產品，那末雖用外貨；也無異提倡國貨，將來工商業突飛猛進，生產大量增加，自給自足，入超自會逐漸的减少了！</p>
<h3 id="c154">工商貸欵實施後的國貨界 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>—應更努力治本辦法</p>
<p>經過許久時期的籌備，幾度向政府洽商的工商貸欵，到前天起纔開始實施了，在這樣不景氣籠罩住我國整個市塲的目下，一股工商業，都奄奄無生氣，金融界又力持緊縮的策略，現在，我們却匪獲到這樣一筆鉅欵，以爲挹注，而使靈活經濟上的周轉，我想，當然一定可有許多工業界，得籍此渡過危機，另創新生路，給與整個國貨前途了很大的助力，對於市而也生了很好的影響，他的功效和力量，正是不可忽視的。</p>
<p>不過，在這裏我又深深地感覺得，這種工商信用放欵的辦法，實在僅是一個治標之計，並且，本市全部的總額，祇有五百萬元，每家又以五千元爲限，以這樣一個大的都市，民族工業的集合地，而他的限領是這般微小，實在不免有杯水車薪之嫌，所以，在　辦理貸欽進行中，我又敢以最熱烈的希望，要工商界和金融界仍勿忘根本的復興運動，——就是國貨運動的努力，我們要曉得歷年來都是龐大的入超，巨額的漏巵滾滾外流，在這樣的情况下，國民經濟安得不窮，工商面業安得不衰落，就是　兩年來據海關報告，我國的川入口貿易，均有大量的激减，入超的數額，也得相對的减少，但那正是反映我們一般人民購買力的薄弱，市面的益趨黯淡，若將進出口的貿易估量起來，入超仍不稍减，中國經濟前途的好轉，國貨生產工商的發展，總是無望的。</p>
<p>所以，在最後，我敢很肯定的指出，當前的我們國貨界，在得到這樣一種新的經濟助力下面，要益自謀堅定和鞏固自身的基礎，從種種根本的設想上去努力，如（一）解除同業競爭，團給自救，（二）改進技術，節减成本，以最低廉的價格出售，與洋貨相抗衡，（四）急速注意邊陲省區的推鉗，和海外市塲的開拓等，都是目下最急切之圖，其他，我更希望能與金融界澈底合作，再創造更大的工業信用放欵，以策進國內工業和土貨的出口，這樣，治標和治本兩方面相互並進，國貨的當前厄運，一定可以轉危爲一安了。</p>

<p>國貨製造家，應將心得經騐，隨時在本刊發表。不尙空論，但求實際，以便讀者研究與倣行。</p>
<p>徵集國貨廠家，在本埠或內地，作有力之宣傳，薄利推廣國貨。</p>
<p>營業以誠信爲實，不作無聊之减價與贈品。</p>
<p>經理廠長，幹練誠樸，努力苦幹，不作欺詐刁猾的行爲。</p>
<p>用人一秉至公，賞罰嚴明，恩威並濟，不徇私，不舞弊不任用無用的私黨，皆爲成功之要素。</p>
<p>同業嫉妒，爲國貨自殺的主因。應抱利己利人主義，同心戮力，以抵制外貨爲己任。</p>
<p>提倡國貨，應由官廳士紳共同努力。社會之賞罰，亦具有莫大之勢力。曾國藩曰：「風俗之厚薄，奚自乎？自於一二人之心之所嚮而已。」吾於振興國貨，亦云。</p>
<h3 id="c156">願大中學校單獨舉辦國貨展覽會！ <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 劉導溱</p>
<p>在今年這喧騰全國的「學生國貨年」裏，而到處舉辦展覽會，其顯明的意義，不外下列數端：</p>
<p>一·使學生們認識提倡國貨的重要：提倡國貨，一方面所以反抗帝國主義者的經濟侵略，而防免利權的外溢，一方面所以增進發展本國產業的機會，洗雪物質貧乏之恥，而自創中華的機器文明，以實現民生主義之澈底的成功。</p>
<p>二·使學生們領略本國經濟地理的常識：具體的國產貨物的陳列，可給學生們以在課室內聽講外國經濟環境時所得不到的一點關於本國經濟地理的常識，更希望因此引起好搜索的頭腦來下一番精密研究的工作。</p>
<p>三·使學生們接觸國貨的內心：平時裝在洋服裏，混在洋塲裏，染得滿心洋意，薰得週身洋氣的，可以在這裏淸凉一淸凉，醒醒你們的國魂吧！須知道，惟國製之貨品，足示你以中華之精神，惟國出之產物，能示你以中華之地利，短處，把它改進，長處，把它滋榮；以往的錯誤，趁此機會來努力剷除殆碟。</p>
<p>不過，在現在所舉行的各種展覽會，大都偏重小學校方面輾轉流覽着，而不注重於中學校和大學校裏面，這未免是掛漏於萬一了；其實，小學生們的服用國貨，固然有提倡與灌輸知識的必要，然而他們絕不像一般中學生和大學生的醉心歐化，酷愛摩登而嗜用外貨的程度之深！</p>
<p>凡是中學生和大學生，不論男或女，大都處於弱冠與及笄的時期，對於一切服用品，恒喜考究採用舶來，此種風氣，絕不是今朝一時所養成，其醉心歐化藐視國產而不用之病症，可謂根深蒂固，使人不寒而慄了。是以在今年「學生國貨年」中，設不再施一强心之劑，促其從速覺悟而認識國貨服用國貨，否則，即無挽回狂瀾之機緣；所以吾希望在今而後，各中學校及各大學校的當局，應肩起重責，專心致力於籌辦一個學校本身的個別國貨展覽會，徵集各國貨廠商的出品，常以固定的陳列瀏覽，目下雖有「學生國貨年推行聯合會」舉辦着流動展覽會在先，恐其鞭長莫及，力有未逮，難期於普遍，設各大中學校能够自身單獨舉辦，庶使在校的一般學生，近水樓臺都得有認識與接近國貨的機會，默移潛化，比較稍有力量；以吾所知，一個中學生或大學生，想購置國貨，或想服用國貨，往往不知到什麼地方去買方不致上當，旣不認得國貨商的牌號，更不曉得國產品的商標，以致冷淡了嘗試之心而裏足不前者，爲數匪尠，良可喞也；所以吾提出了這個「願大中學校當局單獨辦個別國貨展覽會」問題，以供各大中學校當局之採納，以爲何如？</p>
<h3 id="c157">對於舉辦國展會的意見 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 張彰</p>
<p>最近，據報紙的記載，各處的國貨展覽會，國貨運動會，籌備得非常積極，預計在最近的將來，國貨運動，將有一番轟轟烈烈的表現。這種情形，我們站在國貨界的立塲上看來，誠然是一件值得歡欣的現象；然而，就過去各地的國貨展覽會的情形而論，覺得有幾點是應該加以研究和改良的，現在就我的意思，發表一些意見如下，以供主持國貨展覽會者的參考：</p>
<p>第一，我要貢獻於國貨展覽會的，便是希望有嚴密的組織，健全的組織，須知不健全的組織，最最不能收到大效果的，任何事情，都是如此，舉辦國貨展覽會，自然也不能例外。在過去，各地的國貨展覽會，因爲組織不健全而發生流弊的，例如某地的國展會，有非國貨冒充其間等等，都是不可諱言的事實。因此，我很希望今後的國展會，對於組織方面，務須予以嚴密的注意。</p>
<p>第二，我要貢獻於國展會的，便是希望國展會中貨品的售價，須與當地的售價相等，因爲不是這樣，很容易使當地工商界，發生不滿意的情事的，例如鎭江商界的反對國貨城商塲的到鎭營業，便是一個很顯著的例子，所以，我在這裏，要誠懇的貢獻給主辦國展會的諸公，要知道廉價傾銷，是最最容易引起當地人士的反對的。</p>
<p>第三，我要貢獻於國展會的，便是租價須便宜，目前一般的國展會，廠商如願參加，每間的租費，至少須在三十元以上，這在大規模的國貨工廠方面，固然是沒有問題，可是，一般的小工廠，却因此而沒有參加的機會了。在過去，我們看到的國展會，其參加的國貨廠商，都是著名的國貨工廠，而小工廠能參加其問的，實屬少見，這種情形，似屬求見公平，然而，小工廠的之所以沒有參加的緣故，照我看來，大概是租費太昂的關係吧。所以，我在這裏，又要貢獻於主持國貨展覽會的諸公，對於這一點，也有予以注意的必要，須知小工廠中，未必沒有好的國貨，如因租費太昂，而使它們沒有參加的機會，未免可惜。</p>
<p>第四，我要貢獻於國展會的，便是希望在舉辦國展會的時間以內，多多舉行國貨宣傳，或化裝演講，使一般民眾，明瞭舉辦國展會的意義，而引起他們購國貨的興趣和决心。</p>
<p>上面的四種意見，是我臨時想到的，因爲近來各處舉辦國展會的怒潮，又在高漲起來，爰不顧簡陋的發表川來，拋磚引玉，尙祈高明者不吝教正，則幸甚幸甚。</p>
<h3 id="c158">組織「國貨購用團」 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>「提倡國貨」，只空口說白話後沒有分毫用處的，要在人人都能說能行，才見實效。</p>
<p>熱心擁護國貨的同胞們，不妨集合着自己的親友或隣人，多少任便，組織一個「國貨購用團」，大家黽勉自勵，非國貨飲料不飲，非國貨食料不吃，非國貨衣料不穿，非國貨用品不用。總期團裏各人，家家戶戶之中，眼所見手所觸的純爲本國的物品；吸人膏血的洋貨，我們要看待它當夏天裏的蚊子臭蟲，用種種方法，不準它侵入及存在我們家裏。</p>
<p>這樣的團體一時組織起來，能增加了不少的趣味。大家把擁護國貨的責任，放上了自己的肩胛，多少是一件光榮的事！便是自家的心裏也是痛快的。</p>
<p>我們還希望，今後中國國貨廠家，對於貨品之製造，效用，品質，價格各方面，能作更進一步之研究，總以達到眞正的「價廉物美」爲目的。</p>
<p>讓我們道些消費者及製造者分頭進行，負起自己的責任來吧！</p>

<p>都　雖然是國貨運動的策源地，但　靠少數人的提倡鼓吹，效力力是偏枯微渺的；都會男女是民族前綫的優良分子，提倡國貨，可收事半功倍之效；伊們知道愛國，伊們知道鑒別國產，伊們每個人都受過相當教育，有閱讀新聞紙的能力；縣城人士，事事比較落後，思想是閉固的，志趣常給智識支配，問有一二國產商品展覽，爲時亦僅一月半月，識字不多，尤無力認明商標，國貨市塲，是夢想不到的新興組織；這兩年縣城裏，只見到些畸形事業，甚焉者驅民於奢侈之途！一座小小縣城，分支着五六家銀行，有識之士，錫肇嘉名曰：銀行世界，尾隨銀行勃興的是押棧，養成市塲的投機化，個人的發財主義；我們應該知道，富國裕民是羣眾的責任，經商的旣不肯在富國道上努力一寸一尺，無識下民，又嘗誤解娛樂眞能救國，往往不足三里遠近的小城池，開設幾爿遊藝塲，養成民間的不良風尙，如此無形中便　亡國道上推進了一丈十丈；我很切望每縣成立一所永入國貨市塲，祈求各縣的商界領袖，銀錢業巨子，爲民族經濟增厚點實力，挺身出來建樹些隣縣的風聲，黨政當局，更應予以指導和督促；這種國貨市塲，當與都會的國貨組織，互通聲氣，除經售各該縣著名土產外，務宜注意於家庭日用品，和衣服的需要布疋，至於化裝品，消耗品，在縣的國貨市塲裏，並不希望它成爲主要的營業；多經售地方出產，是教濟內地手工業的根本策略，比較空口憐恤失業者的生計要實惠得多呢；縣民有了構買國產的鵠的地，也無庸他種宣傳和勸導，南通大布，如皋靑布，上海浦東毛中，便是一個實例；上海市學生國貨年推行聯合會，我參加七區的末次會議，曾經有過一個議案，學生暑假中回到內地，應負勸導服用國貨的責任，可是很多學生有勸導無門之苦，誰敢保蹬那家商店是純粹經售國產？就成了絕大問題；我認爲籌設縣城國貨市塲，是目前的一件急務，連米麥麵粉均應一一承銷，因爲這是大宗食糧，非國貨的旗幟，早就飛揚到偏僻城池了，牠們的足跡，已是無遠弗屆的侵略了。</p>
<p>縣城國貨商塲，實有籌設的必要。我以爲各縣所有廟宇，民教館，或公共塲所，爲最適宜的塲地，希望各縣熱心人士，亟起實行。（編者）</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>「小寶貝們，讓他們有一天可以滿心足意地呌喊，喧鬧，笑樂。——一天放假的日子，便不成其爲假日，如其沒有很多的自由和嬉要；所以他們每星期須有一次痛快淋漓的吵鬧的，」裴夫人常這麼表示她的意見，一般矜持拘執的人卻詫異爲什麼滑扶梯，丟枕頭，以及一切恣意歡樂的游戲，竟會在梅莊素日肅靜的房子裏發現的。</p>
<p>有時看去，那所房子確有被拆塌的危險；然而卻總沒有過，因爲裴先生的一個字，任何時候均可立致安靜，童子們也知道自由是不能誤用的。因此，雖然有許多危險的預測，學校儘自發榮滋長，學生漸習於禮儀而培成其德性，竟有莫知其然而然的。</p>
<p>乃德那時殊覺舒適，前面旣有高大的牛奶磁尊以爲屏障，轉角便坐着龐韜摩，裴夫人又在身邊，見他的碟上或杯裏一空的時候，隨時便爲他傾滿。</p>
<p>「坐在那一頭姑娘身邊的是誰？」乃德趁大眾笑樂的時候輕輕間他靑年的近憐。</p>
<p>「那是柏小橋，是裴先生的姨外甥。」</p>
<p>「這名字真希奇？」</p>
<p>「他原來的名字是喬恩，但他們稱他爲小喬，因爲他的父親也是喬恩呢。不過卻寫作一根橋的小橋罷了。這是一個笑話，你看不是嗎？」韜麼說着；又不憚煩地加以說明，乃德覽在還沒懂得，然而也陪以微笑，而且特別興致地加上一句：</p>
<p>「他不是一個很可愛的童子嗎？」</p>
<p>「可不是嗎，他眞博學的很。」</p>
<p>「在他旁邊的一個胖子是難？」</p>
<p>「啊，這是柯太腓。他的名字原是喬治，不過我們稱他爲太腓，因爲他吃得太多了。在裴伯伯旁邊的小家伙是他的兒子羅勃，還有那個高大的拂期是他的姪兒：他也教一些兒，彷彿照顧我們的模樣。」</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>太陽走到怡和廠　高煙囪邊的時候，牛肉老闆　便挑着重重的擔子趕來了，唉唷哼唉唷哼」哼着，畢竟他是五十到頭的人了，雖然還是那樣一個胖子，精力究屬有限，你瞧他一拐一拐的步子，怪可憐相的。</p>
<p>到胡同口，息下擔子，把那塊從白色用成灰色，滿染油場的布揭去，露出一塊一塊紅色的牛肉，牛筋，牛肚……又從後面木桶裏取出一塊長方木板，一把雪亮的菜刀。坐在木桶上，抹抹頸根裏的汗，有幾　灑在牛肉上。</p>
<p>老主顧—酒鬼阿和跑上來：「牛肉老闆，切十五個銅子，付十三個，欠你二個。」牛肉老　連說：「沒事，沒事。」邊伸出油膩膩的手切牛肉，片子薄得像桑皮紙，手法純熟，他想再要薄些，一來使主顧看着滿意，二來自己得不虧本，他曾對人說：「這勢口做買賣不帶點滑稽，準得連老婆蝕掉。」</p>
<p>「你的東西怎麽越賣越貴了，牛肉老闆；你知道現在甚麼都便宜啦！」酒鬼阿和不滿意，照他分配，自己過四兩燒酒，還要帶一半回去給老婆兒子過泡飯，他吃起來。一絲一絲的嚼嚼滋味，再咽下。</p>
<p>「老主顧還欺你嗎，眞是，掙你一個銅子買藥吃，目今洋價三千四百開外，牛肉得大洋錢去買，你想想，做小生意眞不是人做的。」他咬咬牙齒。他伸手揮去牛肉上的許多蒼蠅。有一隻跟着酒鬼阿和飛跑了。</p>
<p>擔子前又冷落了，他和正在收攤的小皮匠搭訕，說昨天他做一個夢，夢中他自己開了一爿教門館子，忽而灶上起火了……就嚇醒。小皮匠對他說：「你要做大老闆了。」牛肉老闆苦笑着，心想：「快老死的人了呵。」瞧着太陽落下去。</p>

<p>— 孟傳安</p>
<p>讀本刊闌刪君之木魚和龍舟歌援，文中與事實略有出入，現據所知者，更正如下，若謂吹毛求疵，則非本意矣。</p>
<p>昔日唱，「木魚書」者，多擊木魚拍和，今則以小鼓代，顧名思義，「木魚」之名由是產生，其本事之支配，多濫觴於民間流行之小說，如「再生綠」等是，情節亦不過忠孝節義，悲歡離合而已。吾粵鄉人，多於茶餘酒後，手執一卷，吟唱自得，作　無上消遣。</p>
<p>昨日所刊之「寶玉哭靈」一段歌　，並非龍舟歌，乃是粵曲中之帮子慢板，爲昔日小生風情杞之拿手傑作，此種斑本，不入「龍舟」欄。</p>
<p>昔日唱，龍舟歌」者，多爲流浪歌丐，手持木刻之龍舟，胸前繫一小鑼鼓，口唱吉利之龍舟歌，沿門求乞，此中多老嫗盲叟，無所依歸者，人亦憐其老朽，樂予周濟也。今粵曲界新腔百出，每一段新曲，多參入各種小曲，而龍舟歌譜，亦不能破例矣。</p>
<p>「客途秋恨」與「嘆五更」爲著名之「南音」，昔已風靡一時，並非龍舟歌，憶昔十年前，本報劇評欄內，光磊室主嚴月池君曾爲文論及，謂予不信，試聽白駒榮唱「罵東宮」之一段龍舟，與「客途秋恨」唱片，（勝利公司出品）聲調兩樣，是非立辨。</p>
<p>又有一種「粵謳」，亦爲粵東民間文學之一，創自招子庸之「夜吊秋喜」，哀感頑艷，傳誦一時，至今粵報界猶闢粵謳一欄，登載此類文字，以助餘興。</p>
<p>至於「鹹水歌」，多涉及男女戀愛故事，男女追逐，一問一答，但歌詞粗俗，不足取也。</p>

<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>月英道：賈老爺說他們穿得破破爛爛，不會說話，又不董規矩，若是在這裏碰到了熟人，很難爲情，所以不讓他們來。浣花站起來久走到棹子邊，端起一杯茶慢慢的喝着，眼睛却在月英全身打量，問道：就是爲了這個心裏很難過嗎？還有別的事情不順心的沒有？月英道：我纔是跟着賈老爺過了一天，這些那專說得上。浣花笑道：在作新娘子的時候，丈夫總是用許多好話來哄着的，賈老爺也用了什麽話哄你沒有？月英紅着臉，略微開了一點笑容。但是這笑的時間非常之短，立刻就收止住了，又繃了臉皮子坐着。浣花想了一想，笑道：你喜歡賈老爺嗎？他依然繃了臉皮子。浣花道：你恨他嗎？月英道：我恨他作什麽？他也不是霸佔了我，他是花了錢買我的。浣花道：你總有點怕他吧？若不是怕他，爲什麽他呌你關上門坐着，你就關上門坐着呢？月英先是微微一笑，隨後又嘆了一口氣道：我吃人家的穿人家的，能夠不聽人家的話嗎？他說畢竟是眼圈兒一紅。在這種情形之下，浣花也就觀透了八九分了。於是兩人對面坐着，各自無言。約莫有二十分鐘之久，誰也不曾說話。接着有了脚步響走到門口，就問道：咦！門怎麽沒有關呢？隨着這話音，就是賈多才進來了。（二八四）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>大致是這樣的；譬如伊有一天，要我做一件什麽事情，我當時雖已覺得這是錯誤了，但爲着不敢隨便違抗伊的命令的緣故，仍照着伊的主意做了，待到做出來之後，當然大家都知道是錯了，可是誰也不敢批評，太后自己也祇當不曾瞧見一樣，一句話都不說，及至過了四五天或六七天，我們對於　事已經完全忘掉了，伊老人家部還會自己招認起來了。</p>
<p>「那天的事實在是我的錯」！伊總是這樣的說。</p>
<p>所聽伊說了，眞恨不能等道：「本　　你的錯啊」！但我是决不敢如此放肆的，祇能心上這樣想罷了。</p>
<p>現在再說太后爲了不願再給那放逐廣東巡撫的一件專縈繫在腦際，以致使伊時感不快，於是伊就亟着要做些比較快樂的事，籍以忘掉所有的煩惱；伊想了好久，終於想出來了。</p>
<p>「這幾天，荷花必然是開得很旺盛的；明天早上，少不得又要有幾百支開放出來了」！伊向我們說道：「所以明天早上，我們大家必須特別的起得早些，一同上昆明湖去，駕着那條游艇，盡量的賞玩一番。各人記着：在早膳之前，一定就要出發的」！</p>
<p>因爲明天早上已預定下這樣一件有趣味的消遣，立刻就把太后所有的一股煩惱掃除了，一直到伊上牀安息，也不曾有過暴燥憤怒的表示；就是上牀之後，似乎也比往日睡熟得早些，而且鼾聲頻作，睡得非常甜蜜。（三八四）</p>

<p>— 吳吉人</p>
<p>江南造船所課長陳幼臣先生，公務餘暇，很愛好飼養金魚，其初，養幾缸在寓邸中玩玩，後來，魚一天天的多起來，那才於上年集合了三位同志，組織了一所「金魚樂園合作社」。在滬西的大木橋路路東，闢了二畝多地的一處園塲，購置沙缸二百，水泥池塘二十，規模甚大，集種尤富，舉凡南北的粗細名種，都已經齊備，其中有「五彩龍種珍珠」一種，可以說全滬的冠軍，因爲，這個種子，外面從來沒有見過，此刻，該園已在本月四日開幕了，由電影明星而兼有「金魚美人」芳徽的顧蘭君女士，舉行揭幕禮。顧女士的雅號，還是在漕河涇冠生農塲那天宴客才得來的。開幕之日，賀客同顧客，非常的熱鬧，陳先生擬在開始營業后，另設門市部，那麽今年新收的五六萬小魚兒，一定可以飛快的暢銷哩。</p>
<p>上月，幾位迷魚同志組織了一個「中國藝魚社，不幸得很，一位發起人鄭正秋先生，會在敘餐後的第二天就病了，沒有四五天竟就不起，這也可說是我們藝魚同志失了一位領導者了，這是很可惋惜和悼念的。</p>
<p>前幾天，洗冠生先生約我談話，承他的情，邀我在農場中去同他們管理金魚，我說：不長農塲裏有位陳仲英君在管理嗎？他說：他工廠方面另有職務，金魚，他又屬外行，不過以前由他照顧照顧而已；此後請你去辦理，以資熟手。我於是很感謝他，而一方面可以吿訴友好們，凡是有金魚方面的事兒要找我，每天上午，是必在冠生農場中的。</p>
<p>最近，得揚州梁典成先生來書，他吿訴我，新近從平津回來，曾經到過津沽的八里台地方的南開大學去參觀他們那裏養在園中的金魚，據梁先生信上說；我養魚化去八千多塊錢，自以魚養得也算不差了，那知，一看南開的魚兒，簡直我家中的一條也比他們不上，南開他們養的種子不過十餘種，但却屬精美絕倫，決非北平的「中央公園」，同「西山」等處所可比擬的。他們那裏魚的身子是碩大異常，大概在英尺十七八寸者有三四百尾，（合裁尺一尺五寸之譜。）尾大如芭蕉扇，又似大號面盆，身之肥，有如大飯碗，選種之精，更不可多顜，如「帽子頭反鰓兼帶球」，「蝦蟆頭反鰓帶球」，「老虎頭帶球」，望天龍反鰓帶球」，等均非他處所易看到，尤令人觀賞不置者，則「壽星頭堆肉」是也，此魚頭頂紅瘤堆至英尺二寸之高同惜止存一尾耳。梁君在那裏徘徊池側者，往復三四匝，天暮猶不忍遽去，可云觀止。梁又謂籍知養魚非易事，决不能較栽花養鳥之可以小成也。蓋金魚嬌弱不能雜處於江渚之間，與水屬相沆濫，因無自護能力，上蒼故披以華麗之錦鱗，幻爲各種優美狀態以取悅於人，於是迷魚者每偷得浮生半日。從而賞玩之，覩其游泳之樂，機心漸泯，頓忘其崇朝之辛苦，而金魚始得而存，且繁殖不息已。梁君誠知音，而可謂迷魚之尤甚者矣。</p>

<h3 id="c204">巴札洛夫底評價 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 白萊</p>
<p>當我們讀過阿爾志巴綏夫底沙寧，總覺得在日久所接觸的人海中有着那麽一種玩世不恭的人物；我們在讀過龔查洛夫底阿布羅摩夫，就彷彿感到朋友間有多少人總沾上那種弱志薄行的毛病；我們也可以從鄰居找到魯迅底阿Q，從遠方來的旅人找到西萬提斯底唐吉訶德。……這許多文學上的典型人物的製作，它們底最大的成就便是能使讀者們發生一種親切味，一種活生生的現實感；至少總使讀者們自己覺得那其中的任何一個典型人物彷彿都是似曾相識的朋友，或是敵人。基於這一意義，讓我們考察一下屠涅涅夫底「父與子」中的巴札洛夫吧。讓我們看看巴札洛夫這種人是否存在我們大衆中間，而且，試給他一個公平的估價吧。</p>
<p>作爲俄羅斯前世紀六十年代不同的兩代人底衝突史的屠格涅夫底「父與子」，代表「子」代的巴札洛夫是以一個否定主義者的姿態而出現的。關於這點，我們只要看他怎樣跟那代表「父」代的保羅論辦，便可瞭然。</p>
<p>『我不明白你……一個人怎樣能不承認主義，規則你的行動是把什麽做根據呢』？——這是保羅的質問。</p>
<p>巴札洛夫更正他的話道：『我們認爲有用的事便是我們行動的根據。在現在這時侯，最有用的事是否認』……</p>
<p>『否認一切嗎』？</p>
<p>『否認一切』。</p>
<p>『怎麽？不但詩歌，藝術，…而且…說來可怕』…</p>
<p>『一切』。巴札洛夫鎮靜的覆說一遍。</p>
<p>俄羅斯這偉大的母胎之所以終於能榖誕生了一個嶄新的後代，在這裏應該獲得確切的說明：那是由於俄羅斯卽使在前世紀的六十年代，便已然出現了像巴札洛夫那樣野性的人物。這樣的人物，在任何時代，對歷史都負着催生的任務，而且往往從這裏又必然地完成了悲劇的一生。因爲大部份人，正如巴札洛夫底論敵保羅所說一樣：『他們把傳統的一切看作神聖的，他們是服從長老的，他們是沒有了信仰不能生活的』。然而，也正爲了這類人物一生充滿了悲劇纔值得加以最大的稱讚的。</p>
<p>自然，巴札洛夫也不是全然沒有缺點。恰好相反，爲了他是從現實生活裏攝取出來的活生生的人物，他具有缺點乃是至明的事。他這樣自白道：『一切都依賴着感覺……把我自己來做一個例。我一切都取消極否認的態度，因爲我的感覺是這樣』…這種有類觀念論的遊戲，也正因此加重了巴札洛夫底悲劇生涯的成份。</p>
<p>所以巴札洛夫常常是任性的。他雖則抨擊了現實一切的醜惡；譭謗了社會一切的虛偽；在那加促舊的母胎底臨產的意義上，這種傾向該得到稱讚的。然而他卻並不要求實踐。『我决心什麽事也不做』他這樣說。當他回答自己的論敵，也特別點明他只是要來嘲笑一切。從而我們可以意味到在某一意義上他有類於空談家，也正是基於他沒有正確地認識自己底成長的過程之綠故。</p>
<p>惟其巴札洛夫具有上述的缺點，他纔不致是一個從天空掉下來的人。而况他勇敢，有眼力，他仍有着應得的評價的。其實他也並不是不知道自己的缺點，當他的朋友阿卡提預備要結婚的時候，巴札洛夫自己曾這樣說：</p>
<p>『——在臨別的時候，我再對你說：你做的事是很聰朋的；因爲你是不宜於過我們那粗陋，苦痛，漂蕩的生活的。你沒有銳氣，沒有怨毒，雖然有靑年的勇敢，靑年的精神；可是來做我們這種運動，那是不夠的。像你們這種貴族一類的人，至多只能負擔些優美的忍耐，發表些優美的憤慨，再不能超過這個了，這有什麽用呢！……而我們卻要爭鬥。我們的灰塵撲進你的眼裏去，我們的汗泥濺滿了你的一身，』……從這裏很顯然地證明巴札洛夫多少已然糾正了自已的缺點。同樣，在他臨終的時候，他還那樣謙遜地自白道。</p>
<p>『…俄國需要我！…不，不，顯而易見的，毫沒有這樣的需要，需要的是誰呢？皮鞋匠，成衣匠，屠戶』…</p>
<p>然而，我們應該說我們需要巴札洛夫！他是活生生的存在於我們大衆中間，他有缺點，那缺點甚至是爲我們所熟知的。因爲他不是神話裏的救世主。他的出現能使我們確切地感到他的存在。旡論如何，在這艱困的世紀裏，像巴札洛夫這樣的人，仍舊會給人加以推重，是无須說的吧？</p>
<h3 id="c205">會做生意 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>『先生家裏了！』這在故鄉早就變爲成語，意思是『只好將就一點；』因爲自己家中的生活，總比在做事地方的簡陋。我從學校裏回來，固然只得喝常帶泥土氣的河水，自己動手擦桌子，拖地板；連看份報，寄封信，也非親自跑出去不可。適值爾期，我的皮鞋底早就走穿，漏水了，不得不另買一雙套鞋。</p>
<p>薪水本只支得一點點，路上又用去了不少，凡事打算盤，在實行上街以前，我先探問家裏的人，套鞋怎樣的好；都說要買老牌的才合算。</p>
<p>到了雜貨店裏，出來招待我的是個瘦瘦的小白臉；知道了我所要的東西以後，就拿出一個紙匣子來打開給我看。</p>
<p>『我要老牌的，』我把那雙黑色的套鞋照原放進匣子裏說。</p>
<p>「這不是老牌的麽？」小白臉說着重行取出那鞋子來給我看。</p>
<p>「沒有別的老牌了麽？」</p>
<p>「你要什麼老牌呢？」</p>
<p>『雙錢牌。』</p>
<p>「這不就是麽？」</p>
<p>他所指着的是兩把剪刀的標記；「雙錢」同「雙剪」聲音因然相像，形狀也類似，但總不是同一的脾子。</p>
<p>「我要的是雙錢牌！」我重複說。</p>
<p>「哦！那是早就沒有的了，」小白臉響亮的回對，「現在那裏還有雙錢牌的貨物呢！」</p>
<p>「那末大喜脾或者速珠牌！」</p>
<p>「這是更不用談的了；不會騙你的，先生！現在這就是最好的老牌套鞋了！」</p>
<p>照我固有的習慣，買東西，質地的杯壞雖然也顧到，總是更加食圖便利的，只要已經差不多，往往模糊過去。可是套鞋，旣同家裏的人討論過，覺得不好意思太隨便；以爲不妨且到別個鋪子裏去看看，表示了不嬰雙剪牌的以後，旋轉身子想就走。雨仍歸縣的下着，路上泥滑得很；脚指頭上早就感到滲水，再走濕路太爲難。正在猶豫，忽然肩胛頭上被輕輕的拍了一下，回轉身子去探視，小白臉就拿起另一雙套鞋來同我說，「這個，是最好的了！」</p>
<p>接過手來一看，就是我所要的雙錢牌。</p>
<p>『怎麽剛才說是這個脾子現在沒有了呢？』我不禁這樣實問他。</p>
<p>「哈哈！」他得意的回對，『這眞是最好的老牌了！你要，就賣給你！』</p>
<p>「那末雙剪牌並非「最好的？」怎麽剛才說是最好的了呢？」</p>
<p>「哈哈！雙剪牌最好，雙錢牌更好！」</p>
<p>雖然說得很自在，小由臉的話總是前后矛盾的；但他同樣說得像煞有價事，也實在說得起勁，出神認眞的情形，使得我再也不想同他多購。事情是一目了然的了。，無非因爲雙剪牌的利息厚，所以要玩這一套把戲。商人以錢爲前提，說謊本來算不得一回事，會得見風使帆隨機應變才好。這個小白臉，將來總是「出山」的罷；我無以名之，名之爲「會做生意。」</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>她垂下頭，一面把額角抵着窗戶底玻璃；白玫瑰還是香噴噴地在那閃光的黑頭髮上面。「紙有一個人。他在生時候祗是痴呆的可憐的人，」她說，幾乎是用鳴咽的聲音說，「但他總是我的父親呀，沒有別人會像他那般愛我；—他若在世時現在就不會把我厭棄的。」</p>
<p>她說過這話之後，我們二人都沉默了。祗我不知不覺地抓着她的雙手，她也讓我抓着。——忽然我聽見屋子另一邊。小柱廊方面，『土伯爵』呼喚她名字。</p>
<p>她全身顫慄一下。「娜麗，」我說，『你不能夠脫離道個人麽？』</p>
<p>她睜大眼睛憂鬱地望着我。『能夠的！』她輕輕說，我彷彿看見她口角間現出一種微笑，但這微笑似乎含有詭秘成分在內。此時呼喚聲音又響了一次，而且愈近到我們旁邊來了。</p>
<p>她趕緊把眼淚揩乾。「後會有期，菲力，後會有期！」她低聲說。我覺得兩隻小手同我握了一下，然後她就走開了。</p>
<p>我不知道我在樹林間還徘徊了多久。直至廳內音樂突然停止使我聽見林中貓頭屬呌喊時候，我才淸醒過來。</p>
<p>爲要從那石階走到小路去，我仍須經過屋子前面；那時我又看見娜麗一次。她站在廊內，手臂抱着一根柱子，穿過樹林看下海面去，那裏正有一個電光眩人眼目地映現在水面上。</p>
<p>海濱</p>
<p>我躺在墊裸奔上，很長久不能入睡；我正計劃如何靠我的母親帮助給娜麗一個安身之地，但是最困難的還是如何說服娜麗使她願意到那裏去。</p>
<p>第二日早晨我醒得很晚，醒時正看見『市長」弗里茨。—我少時常常道樣稱呼他—站在我的床前，用他那誠實眼睛對我微笑。—不久我們二人就坐在沙發上了，弗里茨滔滔不絕地談起我們的在海德堡的朋友。但我祇用半邊耳朶聽他—，昨晚那件事情還縈繞着我的思想。</p>
<p>不久之後由我提議，我們就出門散步去了。我們在榆樹蔭道上沿海濱並步走着，此時我就把胸中鬱積的話說斑來，吿訴他我所聽見的和親眼看見的關於娜麗的事情。弗里茨默默無言祇聽我說，有時低低地咒詛一聲，一面用脚踢開路上石子，或者在空中做一個擊刺的手勢。彷彿拳頭握着一把劍似的。</p>
<p>這手勢並不是沒有意思的；八天之後他果然同「土伯爵」對立在决鬥塲上了。「土伯爵」在决鬥中用力從左向右劈了一劍，於是弗里茨面上受了傷；現在當他發怒時候，那片傷瘢還在他額上發出紅光。——</p>

<p>帶着一顆輕快的心，走上回鄉去的小論船上。</p>
<p>好久離開了故鄉，現在重新踏上回鄉的小論船，一種不容易描摹的故鄉的親切的風味，撫着一顆旅人的心了。</p>
<p>在小論船上聽到了好久沒聽到了的家鄉人的口音。</p>
<p>半年來爲着生活飄泊在皖北的一個小山城裏，滿眼展開着灰色破落的景象，僅這半年，然而我已經看厭了黃沙飛揚的天空，黑壓壓的綿一旦着山岡。在小山城裏我聽厭了整天喧鬧的鑼鼓聲，重濁的口音；酸辣味的菜挾着淡塊的饅頭下肚的生活，從此我領略了生活的苦味。</p>
<p>那裏沒有淸麗的山水，淮水翻着黃濁的浪；山峯禿着光頭，崎嶇的山路，我走得倦了。</p>
<p>現在踏上歸途的論船上，一片綠水，皺起一朶朵微笑樣的柔波，綠水上展攤着親切的鄉情。遠處靑山在淡藍的天邊浮現出來。</p>
<p>烟樹斷處，有幾處村舍，濃綠的柳樹倒垂在澄淸的水上，柳叢裏飄出淸脆的蟬聲。</p>
<p>一塊塊鮮綠的水田在眼　前浮過去，老農夫赤着褐色的腿，在水田裏工作着。</p>
<p>一路上跟同船的一位從前小學時代的校長先生隨便扯談着；他吿訴我在早半個月，沒下雨，這裏也起了旱荒的恐慌。之援，一連下過幾次雨，田郊可望回復過來啦！</p>
<p>小輪在淸綠水上一路駛過去，故鄉的瞭望臺伸在眼前，望得到了。</p>
<p>同船有好多個回鄉去的女學生，靠着窗口，面迎着故鄉低低唱着歌。在一條圓軟的歌聲裏，故鄉漸見近現到眼面前了。</p>
<p>船抵碼頭，岸上河棚內好多男女佣人掛着一張笑勁的臉，來迎候回鄉來的老爺少爺小姐們！</p>
<p>一想到近年來我的家早已跟着時勢窮落下來，傭婦已兩年多不雇用了。</p>
<p>携着手箱，帶着一點小小的黯然的塲感踏上岸去。</p>

<h3 id="c209">三年 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 夏蒂</p>
<p>轉瞬又三年了！</p>
<p>光陰的飛快眞使人感到有幾分慌亂，然而故我依然，教流浪者的心弦，彈着空虛的，悲悽的，饑饉痛苦底調子，在這廣漢的人羣之中，儘碰着到處的釘子，看夠了許多人的白眼。每一條熱鬧的街頭，淸靜的巷尾，也許都印過了自己的足痕，做湊着人海中的泡沬。</p>
<p>流浪的生活，已經是不三年了，然而從被農村裏的饑饉趕了出來，做都市裏的流浪者，還只有三年。三年的日子，積起來的數目不能算是怎樣的多，可是鱗傷的創痛，已經割滿這悲痛的心房！一個人在天涯流落，是爲了一點生之希望，然而希望恰如一條繩，長長地緊絞着你的周身，說不能動彈，即使給你動彈，像戲謔般的在那裏和你開玩笑。生活就是那樣的實西。</p>
<p>在這長而又短的三年之中，人生的苦味，雖不能普遍嘗過，但，人們都是自私的，誰個對自己的同類，會能有一點同情的體諒？</p>
<p>聽夠了海風的咆哮，又看厭了這都市的霓虹，可是在日裏自己的動搖的心，是多麽旗旌般地，在幻夢的思流之裏，麗蕩着掙扎的思流。曾用過一種探險的眼光去視察這都市的深處，但，深隱着的悽苦的悲吟，是要特別的諦覺，去聆那呻吟的聲音，人生的悲慘，有比自己經過的三年，那樣的還要厲害。</p>
<p>到處的爲着自己的生命掙扎，爲着尋求，而人生幾何？三年的滑走是快的。而這看不見時空，是在埋痙着自己的靑春，掙扎的三年呵，是將載起自己的荒凉，到茫茫的不可知底未來的歲度，邁上衰枯的域裏。於是對於三年過去流浪的情懷，追起著橄欖的回味。然而時日的險阻，又囂張着貪　人們的心，什麼時候才是　足的日子？我不禁又欣羨過去的三年來！</p>

<h3 id="c210">平市取締男女同校的糾紛 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>平巿取締私中男女同校問題，曾引起社會上各方的指責，現今這糾紛已愈擴愈大。一面巿府堅持不準男女合校，訓令社會局，嚴加禁止各私中招收女生，並創辦巿立第二女中，以備安挿轉學女生。他方私中亦由聯合會呈請教部，制止平巿當局取締男女同校，同時仍各進行招收女生。茲敎部已電平市當局，有所指示，社會局以某種關係，未將原電公佈。惟聲稱敎部對男女分校一案，原則上又贊同。私中則謂敎部覆聯合會電，僅令靜候解决，並未言明不准男女合校，欲向社會局索閱原電。這糾紛目前雙方尙在相持中。</p>
<p>一國的敎育制度，應是統一的。我國中學男女同校，本爲中學規程所允許。全國各地，行之已久。不意平市忽有取締私中男女合校之舉，這與敎部規程</p>
<p>再則平市取締男女同校，如果實行，今後一般私中女生轉學的問題，亦必發生困難，新創辦的第二女中，招收二年級以上學生，旣與教部中學規程不合。而平市私中，原有商科師範科之分，市立女中則僅有普通班，這在女生轉學上，必至無法安挿。這點平市當局應有相當的考慮。</p>
<p>我國敎育界眞是糟得很，幾年來時常掀起各種無謂的風波。今平市當局主張中學男女分校，亦屬多此一舉。近據報載消息，禁止男女同校，廣州亦將繼起效法實行。這不曉得是因爲北平及廣州的中學校風特別壞，故當局者不得不嚴加取締，還是南北兩地的思想，比別處特別的原故？然整頓學風，男女分校並不是聰明的辦法。這只能認爲是一種摧殘女子敎育的手段。</p>

<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>（一）浪花</p>
<p>曾經有過這樣的一個機會，在一個沒人注意的地方，重溫了我這天眞的野孩子的夢境。</p>
<p>便是這樣的一片窮了眼睛也望不見盡頭的荒漠，這荒漠在不停地跳動着，番起了從月亮那里透過來的微弱然而閃亮的光輝，跟着那怒吼般的浪潮里掩映着。四周是寂靜且空虛，沒有半點夾什的聲音，空漠的回聲盡責的播送着那浪，追逐着浪，浪拍擊着浪的雄壯而又柔揚的聲音。在荒漠着歌奏起那動人的馬賽革命曲，渴望自由的調子，浸着了整個空間。我這個平凡人自不會例外，一年來的不安定的浮浪的生活，還加上朋友間的謠言中傷排擠，使我變成近於老人的沈默，這時候也活躍起來了。</p>
<p>於是，我挺起了我的曾經過箭傷的胸膛，我展開了我這一對還可以自負的有力的臂膀，我對着了那不斷地在追逐指擊的浪潮，我裂開了我給人搥破了的聲帶，我狂叫着，象一匹沒人性的野牛。回聲的雄渾安慰了我，浪花的高潮鼓勵了我，使我忘記了我原是躱在這食人的大都市的一個沒人注意的角落里。</p>
<p>孩子的時候起，我便是在海的懷抱中長大起來的。對於海的雄姿，我曾經象一個宗敎信仰者信仰他的「主」一樣地崇拜着，也曾有一個時候我願意把自己的一切交給了海，讓海來支配着我的將來，使我變成了象浪花一樣地盡着自己的責任在整個的看來，浪花是渺小不過的；可是浪花對於他自己却已經是很盡了一已的責任了。</p>
<p>——把你整個的身體，象浪花一樣地盡責的拍到崖岸上去吧！把你整個的未來，交付了海吧！把你變成了海一樣，在不停的努力中掙扎出那雄渾而壯偉的未來吧！</p>
<p>這樣，我便忘記了我原來是因爲害怕那一百度以上高溫度層里走出來的野孩子，我更忘記了一些只會在「個人」圈子里謀成他的福利而去推倒別人的傢伙，我更忘記了這原是一個惡濁的世界，甚而至我忘記這樣的一天晚上我便是「無家可歸。」</p>
<p>可敬愛的浪花啊，你會想到一個平凡的浮浪者對你的期望嗎。</p>
<p>（二）影</p>
<p>今晚沒有月亮，也沒有星星，空氣鬱沈沈的處在蒸籠里一樣，我看不見一點光，我更看不見我的影子。</p>
<p>從來頂關心我的，便是我的影子。無論我處在了什麽惡劣的環境下，或者處在再窮苦不過的時候，一切朋友都離開了我，而我的彩子還是一偸了空，便來探望我，而且還帶來了一綫光明。我想假如世界上再沒有一個了解我的人，我便把我放在沈默的範圍里，讓自己孤獨了自己，讓影子來安慰自己。</p>
<p>當我給生活逼着走上我的征途的時候，我還帶了很多熱情，和一個野孩子的心，路一走得遠了，騙子見得多了，掛羊頭賣狗肉的傢伙也來刦奪我了，把我一切所有都刦奪了去，還刺傷了我的心。這樣我又不得不把自己幽囚在沈默里，讓時間來侵蝕自己。我還沒有走上和當時允許自己的志願相反的道路，這是値得感謝不時激刺我的海，和我的影子。</p>
<p>夏夜是苦悶的，世界上的一切都象變成了再殘酷不過的東西，而這些虛偽的傢伙，又只是向着一些帶有一個不幸的命運的人進攻，肆意地欺負。這樣我負傷了，躱在一個沒人注意的角落，用自己的希望來敷那可怕的傷口。</p>
<p>——什麽時候我可以看見我的影子咧。</p>
<p>有趣；十點鐘左右，全村莊便已很靜了，看下去只有太陽在照着，靜悄悄的，沒有什麼聲音；有也就是鷄叫，這一叫就更顯得是靜悄悄的了。中午村鷄的長鳴，聽來就眞像是把日子拉長起來了。寂寞里有時候我疑心：難到主人都忙碌去了，只剩下鷄在看家？</p>
<p>山村里只有兩個時侯比較有聲音，一個下午，夕陽快過山了的時候，村婦們在這時要喊孩子，房頂也會飄出炊烟，駱駝，驢，人，都往家里走；這自然是會有些聲音的。另一個便是早晨，鄕下人是懂得一日之計在於晨的，忙得有聲有色，也就在這時候：賣菜的去趕早市，年輕的小夥子便牽着驢到距山有七</p>

<p>——山居瑣記</p>
<p>住處雖說是在山上，但實際是並不高的；旣不是爲着避暑而上山，高處的房子，貴還不說，在我就覺得不必住得那麼高；自炊自食，住太高了，買點什麼葱蒜的時候，上下山就不方便了。</p>
<p>因爲住處不高，由麓中的農舍，就成了我的隣居，一個住慣了城市的人，算是又住了一次異地的鄕村：景味旣和故鄕不同，和城里也大有分別。譬如在早晨，霧色朦朧中聽驢叫，鴉噪，和上下山的駝鈴的玎　，這在故鄉是夢也不會夢到的；城里，鴉噪還有，但別的可就難領略了。就這一點說，住在山腰里就眞此住在高些的地方强：這還是我住久了才感到的興趣，其初眞是沒有想到。</p>
<p>山居多蚊，多蚊便促我早睡；早睡早起，這才不辜負了山居。實在說，住在山上而不領略山上的早晨，眞是很缺憾的。農人們多在早晨忙碌，也眞忙得八里路的鎭上去招徠遊山的人：各人都壞着一個希望出發，在這種空氣里忙，就確是有聲有色的了。</p>
<p>山晨多霧，好在也並不厚，只是一層紗，輕輕地籠住房和樹，太陽一照也就散了。忙碌的人都在霧里忙，表現出忙的是聲音。笨重的擔子壓在肩上滋滋作聲，在霧里，只聽見聲音看不見人；那聲音越響越遠的時候，我知道，一個鄉下人又挑着一個希望遠了。趕驢的號種哦唷之聲，是帶着些鞭策的味道的，也許是畜生們貪食路旁帶露的野草吧。鞭策聲把輕霧鞭走以後，駝鈴的玎璫就顯從淸脆多了。讓駝鈴喝着自信的歌，一步步地前走吧，早晨的山程，有着你們趕路就不寂寞了；我心里常對駱駝這樣說。眞是，朝氣里的駝鈴是會激起人的自信與樂觀的。</p>
<p>村里有幾家人知道我和兩個朋友早晨會上鎭去買菜，天剛亮，他們便把驢子牽到我的門口來，起初他們還跟着離子跑，後來慣了，就索性把　子交給我</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>們。我們不上鎮的時候，也會有兩三口驢子栓在門口的黑棗樹上，朋友常說：「起來吧，你聽驢子又在踢牆了。」其實那還早得很，椎開窗子看見的還只是霧，還早；等霧略薄的時侯，我們就騎驢逛山了；霧里是不便倒騎驢的，不然或者會更有趣。其實說是騎驢逛山，倒不如說是我們替人家牧驢：我們任驢子食草走路：後面有趕路的來了的時候，勒勒繮繩，讓援面的過去就是了。</p>
<p>這種運動使得我們的身體都結實了些，倒還不辜負了山居；原因還得說是由於早起，住在上山要是起晚了就眞是沒有意思的；九十點才起，聽村鷄寂寞的長嗚，不會悶死人嗎？</p>

<p>— 加藤武雄原作頑石譯</p>
<p>我在初等小學當教員的時候，有一天，在三年級的講堂，講修身的功課，我忘了由於什麽動機，曾向諸生發問道：「諸君！你們肚裏有什麽？知道嗎」？</p>
<p>兒童們見問，便都舉起手來，異口同聲的答道：「知道！知道！」</p>
<p>一個說：「肚子裏有飯」。一個說：肚子裏有胃。」一個說：「肚子裏有腸子。」</p>
<p>全講堂的兒童，都是這一類的答語，大約他們的智識，也就盡於此了。</p>
<p>我於是又問道：「除了你們所答的以外，肚子裏還有什麼？有知道的人沒有？</p>
<p>兒童們對於我這一問，連一個舉手的都沒有了。此刻女生席中，有一個頭繫紅絲帶名孛叫川子的女學生，面上現出得意之色；彷彿說這一問，誰也不能知道，惟有她一個人能知道似的。</p>
<p>我見她這種神色，便向她說道：「川子，你若是知道，就說一說。」</p>
<p>川子立起身來，略微的傾着頭，向我這邊望着。只見她兩頰微動，像是說什麼似的，可是她的臉，羞得緋紅了。她究竟說的是什麼，我的耳朶，一點也沒聽見，因此向她說道：「我沒聽見，請你再說一遍！」</p>
<p>川子的兩頰，又略微的動了一動，這一次，她的臉色，羞得更紅了；可是她說話的聲音，我還是沒聽見，於是又向她說道：「請大聲說。」</p>
<p>川子像振起最援的勇氣來了，喃喃說道：「這個……肚子裏，有小孩兒啊！」</p>
<p>我聽了她的話，不由得說道：「肚子裏有小孩兒？」</p>
<p>我聽罷，便微微的一笑。因爲我這一笑，川子的臉羞得更紅了，並且連她的耳朶，都紅得像火燒着了一般。她立時陷於衆兒童的笑聲之內，且爲衆兒童目光集視之點。我見此刻川子的神色，纔了然女性的嬌羞，同時不見其女之爲女，唯見其淸潔而已；不！直可謂之嚴肅！</p>
<p>今天在電車上，偶然看見一個懷抱小孩兒的少婦；因爲這個少婦，使我想起十幾年前的這段小故事。我想川子到了現在，必也有一二個小孩兒了吧？當年她所等的言語，今將以身證明其眞實了罷？</p>
<p>我這麽一想，我的胸中，不覺起了一種不可名狀的快威。</p>

This time, he returned to the country and took the opportunity to go to Sichuan to report the attitude of the Japanese political and public figures on the Sino-Japanese issue to Chairman Chiang. Chiang's position on Sino-Japanese diplomacy is still the same as before. Even after the Jicha Incident occurred, he did not change his original intention. He believes that if the Japanese side sincerely seeks Sino-Japanese friendship, China should treat them with sincerity. He also said that although Chiang has been directing the bandit suppression military affairs in Sichuan Province recently, he is very clear about the world situation and the Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation. As China and Japan are neighbors, the relationship is particularly important, and both sides should negotiate everything with a sincere attitude.

<p>(Beiping) Takahashi, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, ​​left Taiyuan the day before yesterday and came to Beiping. He was supposed to arrive at 11:00 PM last night, but the train was delayed for a long time due to rain in Shijiazhuang, and he did not arrive in Beiping until 6:30 AM this morning. According to him, this time he left Beiping and first went to Baoding to meet Shang Zhen, which was a courtesy visit. Then he left Baoding and went to Taiyuan to meet Yan Xishan, which was also a normal visit. Yan's attitude was very good, and he was very clear about the situation in North China. Regarding the assassination case of Liu Zuo-zhou, the commander of the special police team in the war zone, he did not know the details. The matter is currently being investigated by the Japanese Garrison Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin. He also plans to go to Tianjin in the next few days. After the British reporter Jones was kidnapped and returned to Beiping this morning, the British military attaché came to visit and asked for help. Because he did not know the details, he could not give a specific answer, only agreeing to inquire in Chengde. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A few days ago, the British reporter Jones was kidnapped by bandits to Guyuan, and then moved to Fengning on the border of Rehe. The Chahar Provincial Government and the Zhengzheng Commission made every effort to rescue him, and successively sent Platoon Leader Zhang Yunji of the Baochang Security Team to the bandit den to negotiate with the bandits. According to a certain source, after the bandits kidnapped Jones to Fengning, he was rescued by the Japanese army, left Fengning last night, and arrived in Chengde this morning. He will be escorted to Beiping by the Japanese in the next few days. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the rumor that Jones has escaped from danger, there is no definite information here. The origin of this rumor is that there was a telegram from a Japanese source saying that the kidnappers had released Jones, but no one can say who sent the telegram or who received it. According to a semi-official Chinese news agency, Qin Dechun notified the British Embassy this morning that Jones had been freed. When asked about the British Embassy, ​​this statement was completely untrue. Qin himself told Dr. Mueller, who was released from the bandit den a few days ago, tonight that after hearing the rumor, he immediately inquired in Zhangjiakou to find out the truth, and then received a reply that the rumor was completely unfounded. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) News received here today from Zhangjiakou says Jones will be released on the Rehe-Chahar border on Saturday. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is still no news of Jones. The rumor that he has been released is completely unfounded. The kidnappers move frequently, making contact difficult. According to unverified news, the kidnappers' attitude has become tougher, and they have increased the amount of the ransom. If this statement is true, then the liaison officers sent by Chahar Province are still negotiating with the bandits. The Chinese and British authorities are now making every effort to find out Jones's whereabouts. Takahashi, the Japanese military attaché here, has telegraphed Chengde to inquire about everything.

<p>(Taiyuan) Heavy rain in Taiyuan is still not stopping. The villages of Da Xiaodongliu in the southwest of Fenhe River in the west of the city have been completely submerged on the 6th. Fortunately, the people all escaped, but all the houses and properties were flooded. The river water level is about to be level with the First Dam. If it rises another foot, it will overflow the bank, and the area west of Ximen in Taiyuan will inevitably become a swamp. Also, the villages of Da Xiaowang in Taiyuan County were completely submerged on the 6th, and all the people were drowned, which was extremely tragic. At 5:00 PM on the 6th, the Garrison Department urgently telegraphed Yan Xishan, saying that the sand embankment outside the North Gate had been submerged in several places and was about to break. After Yan received the report, he immediately took a car to inspect, but was blocked by the water on the way and could not cross. He immediately ordered all the soldiers there to urgently protect the area, and the danger was temporarily overcome. Yan also ordered the Garrison Commander Rong Honglu to be the River Defense Commander, supervising the military police and responsible for patrolling and defending. Soldiers from the military police and various agencies have now all left the city to protect the west, south, and north sides. If the rain does not stop on the evening of the 6th, the dangerous situation will be unimaginable. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fu Zuoyi said that there has been heavy rain in Taiyuan for several days, and many houses in the city have collapsed. The Shanxi-Hebei highway has also been flooded and is muddy and difficult to travel. If there is more heavy rain, the disaster may be unavoidable. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Domestic Cigarette Industry Should Urgently Seek Self-Salvation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Cigarettes are one of the consumables, and are not daily necessities. However, due to the large number of smokers, they have become increasingly popular. The turnover of the cigarette industry in our country is said to be more than 200 million yuan per year. The government regards it as a major source of tax revenue, and the number of people who directly and indirectly make a living from it is probably close to a million. Therefore, the cigarette industry has implicitly become the center of industrial and commercial enterprises and occupies a considerably important position.</p>
<p>Domestic cigarette factories operated by Chinese have always been inferior to foreign companies and have failed to achieve significant development. Since the May 30th Movement, the clamor for advocating domestic goods has been very loud. Domestic cigarette merchants took the opportunity to raise their heads suddenly. New factories rose up one after another, and the products were dazzling. In every way, the rise of the atmosphere at that time was evident. However, due to the impurity of the internal organization and the complexity of competition, they soon declined again. Until last year, some manufacturers used the issuance of giveaways as a means to promote sales. Although the momentum was already at the end of its strength, it still achieved considerable results for a while. This spring, the government implemented measures to ban giveaways, and at the same time, foreign companies lowered their prices, keenly seeking competition. In addition, the market situation was sluggish, and the financial situation was extremely tight. The general purchasing power has declined. Domestic cigarette merchants have suffered heavy blows. Those with a solid foundation can still manage to cope, while those with weak resources are difficult to survive the collapse. Speaking of the dangerous situation, it is really precarious.</p>
<p>Under this precarious situation, if the domestic cigarette industry does not urgently seek self-salvation, the future is unimaginable. We humbly offer advice on its behalf, believing that there are three points that need attention. First, it is necessary to enrich the internal aspects, such as improving the quality of tobacco, improving technology, maintaining good faith, and perfecting the organization. All of these should be considered one by one. Maintaining good faith is the fundamental principle. Looking back at why the sales of domestic cigarettes cannot compete with foreign cigarettes, it is because buyers have failed to do their best to protect domestic goods, and the incomplete organization of the factory has also led to misunderstandings from the outside world. Some tobacco merchants lack good faith and morality, and inevitably cut corners, resulting in products that are not excellent, or are excellent at first and then deteriorated, or are different from yesterday's quality. From the perspective of ordinary people, they often generalize from the particular, and the entire domestic cigarette industry is affected by this. Is this not very unfair? The way to remedy this is to supervise each other and strive to correct previous malpractices. Take a long-term view, abide by credibility, and maintain the principle of consistency from beginning to end to win the confidence of society and establish a permanent foundation. We dare to say that the future profits will surely far exceed those of today. Second, it is necessary to carry out accurate publicity. Once the quality of the tobacco has been improved, one can be free from guilt internally. Then, one must let go and carry out promotional work. The means of publicity must strive to be proper. Whether it is attracting attention with large-scale advertisements or helping people remember with reminder methods, all should be based on introducing the essence of the product and avoid making a fuss about irrelevant things. The past giveaway method used the gambling mentality of the Chinese people, and the motive was already wrong. Moreover, publicizing a product and resorting to giveaways will make the original identity lose its integrity and add to the doubts of discerning people. It is unwise and needs no further discussion. Moreover, the cost of this giveaway method is also considerable. If it can be used for proper publicity, would it not be more dignified and beneficial? Third, it is necessary to seek cooperation between production and sales. Domestic cigarette merchants are already struggling with foreign competition, and there are inevitably mutual suspicions among colleagues. With so many aspects involved, it is difficult to respond. In this exhausted situation, rather than being trapped and collapsing together, why not cooperate to seek survival? Once production and sales cooperate, they will be united and have no more scruples. Funds can be easily circulated, and energy can be concentrated. The various expenses that were originally used for competition among colleagues can be greatly reduced and used to supplement production. There is no need to worry about not having good results.</p>
<p>The above three points are all ways for domestic cigarette merchants to save themselves. The key is to carry them out so as to gradually embark on a smooth path. At the same time, the government should give them considerable convenience out of consideration for the hardships of the merchants. We, thinking of promoting domestic goods, will also be happy to provide full protection. If we work together and make unremitting efforts, then the current predicament of the domestic cigarette industry may still have hope of being overcome.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) In Banqiaozhuang and Dongwozhen in the eastern district of Lutai, the riverbanks were weak due to the rising water of the Huanxiang River and were washed away by the water. The river overflowed for dozens of miles, and more than 1,000 hectares of cotton fields were flooded. In addition, due to continuous storms, there was accumulated water of two to three feet on the ground, and all the roads were destroyed. More than ten villages, including Tianjiazhuang, were all affected by the disaster, and prices soared. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Gucheng section of the Nan Canal rose eight feet overnight on the 4th and 5th. The top of the embankment was only a few inches above the water surface. Many embankments along the river were washed away, and the water overflowed, flooding dozens of villages. Jiang Yankun, director of the Nan Canal Bureau, plans to go to inspect on the 8th. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a Baoding telephone call, Qi Shou'an, director of the Hebei Yellow River Affairs Bureau, telegraphed the province, stating that the water level of the Shaanxi River increased on the 6th, with a water level of 293.84 meters and a flow rate of 500 cubic meters per second. In addition to ordering strict protection of each section, he also ordered the three county chiefs of Dongchang and Puyang to quickly send additional laborers to carefully guard the embankments to avoid collapse. The Hebei Provincial Government decided to allocate 2,000 yuan for urgent relief in Shucheng and 2,500 yuan for urgent relief in Puyang, which will be distributed by the respective county chiefs after investigation. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The flood season of the Hai River this year began on July 15 with the opening of the gate for siltation. The process has been quite smooth for the past two weeks. According to the calculations of the North China Water Conservancy Association, the amount of sand entering the siltation area has reached more than one million cubic meters as of today. At present, the flow rate in the main stream of the Yongding River Triangle Depression has reached more than 70 cubic meters per second due to the upstream water rise, and the sand content is about 5%. By 10:00 PM on the 6th, the water depth on the North and South Horse Roads in the main stream was about 3 meters. The people on both sides thoroughly protected the area, and no accidents occurred. The water gradually receded by 6:00 AM on the 7th, and the current was stable. The south embankment has also been completely repaired. If the upstream does not increase significantly in the next two weeks, the main stream will not be in danger, and the south embankment will be safe. The siltation of the Hai River can be declared a complete success. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level of the Tuotuo River rose sharply on the 6th, with a flow distance of 1,060 cubic feet, hitting the banks and filling the embankments, which was extremely dangerous. The North China Water Conservancy Association has ordered the counties along the river to gather laborers to protect the area. The water level in the third section of the South Canal rose sharply, and the Cang County City River was flooded by backflow from the Machang section. The flooded area was extremely wide, and two breaches occurred in the soil embankment on the 7th. Residents along the river are self-rescuing, and they are using force to prevent ships from passing through. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xuzhou) Li Wenzhai of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, accompanied by Cao Liqing, section chief of the Construction Department, came to Xuzhou from Jinan yesterday. This morning, personnel were dispatched by the special office to accompany them to inspect the Lanjiaba. Li and others inspected the dam mouth and the Jingzhishan Dike and the West Dike of Weishan Lake for a week. In the evening, Li and Cao told reporters that the West Dike of Weishan Lake would not affect the discharge of water. When passing through Hanzhuang, they inspected the Lanjia Dam gate where the lake mouth Shuangzha merges, and felt that the flow rate was still small. It is feared that the water in western Shandong will not be able to drain in a short time. Shandong Province now intends to increase the Jiangsu Dam and carry out the work of blocking the mouth. Li and others are scheduled to return to Jinan tomorrow. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) After the water flow from the north bank of Weishan Lake runs to the south bank, it proceeds very quickly due to the unobstructed flat beach. Yesterday, it arrived at the Jingzhishan Dike, which is seven miles north of Lanjiaba. There is water on the north side of the dike. Today, it has followed the Yanhe River channel, which runs vertically through the Jingzhishan Dike, directly to the Lanjiaba mouth and discharged into the Jing River. The water on the north side of the Jingzhishan Dike is close to Jingzhishan in the east and close to the dam in the west. The Tong County Government has transported disaster relief materials to the Wuduanzhacheng and other places to prepare for disaster relief on the dam. At the same time, it is stepping up the construction of the water-facing stonework of the Lanjiaba to prevent the large water from rushing in. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water on the south bank of Weishan Lake is rising sharply. Yesterday, it crossed the Heads of the Sanerliang Rivers and arrived at the Jingzhishan Dike, about eight miles upstream. This morning, it flowed from the Yanhe River in the middle of the Jingzhishan Dike to the Linjiaba, with a water depth of one meter at the mouth, and flowed south into the Jing River. Although the Lanjiaba has been repaired, the stonework has not been completed. If the water continues to come from the north bank of Weishan Lake, and a large amount of water flows to the south, then the Jingzhishan Dike and the Lanjiaba are in danger of being washed away. The Tong County Government has installed a telephone in Lanjiaba to transmit water information. County Chief Wang Gongxing and Liu Xinyuan, Section Chief of the Construction Department, are both in Lanjiaba to supervise the construction and defend the area. (7th Dispatch)</p>

If this fails, it plans to use poison gas bombs. However, in consideration of global public opinion and humanitarianism, it does not want to use this lightly if it can be avoided. Besides this, Italy is unwilling to antagonize the Abyssinian people by other means, as it wants to establish a colony in the future and live in harmony with the Abyssinian people. The Italian army is now equipped with specially made lightweight gas masks. The Fiat factory has now started producing 50 high-speed aircraft for practice and will produce another 200. All of them are equipped with two engines, and the speed can reach 300 miles per hour. According to Italian newspapers, although Italy is sending a large number of troops to serve in the colonies, it has also compiled new divisions to serve in the country in place of the troops that have been sent out. The recent mobilization order has sent two divisions of regular troops and one division of Blackshirts, totaling 70,000 people, to Africa. As of now, the total number of armed forces in Italy is approximately 900,000. Italy is still able to form new divisions without having to call up more levels of reservists. Therefore, the remaining reservists of the 1912 class are planned to be called up in the future and are not intended to be called up at present. There are currently seven divisions of regular troops, totaling 100,000 people, who have been sent to serve in Africa. Most of them have already set out. Six divisions of Blackshirts, totaling approximately 80,000 people, have also been ordered to go to Africa. In addition, there are two divisions of Eritrean soldiers, totaling 30,000 people, and 10,000 regular troops originally stationed in the colony. Therefore, the number of Italian troops prepared for combat currently reaches 220,000, and there are at least 15,000 specialists, etc., who are traveling with the army, but not as many as with the air force, because Mussolini aims to first attack Abyssinia with aircraft and achieve a quick victory. The Italian authorities have received the London Gazette, stating that the Italian female ambassador to England has met with many retired British officers, soldiers, engineers, doctors, and nurses, all of whom are willing to serve Italy in wartime. The Italian ambassador expressed gratitude to them and sought instructions from the government. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) News here today: Italy currently has a large army of 225,000 people, some of whom have already left for East Africa, and some of whom are also preparing to leave. Currently, Italy has armed 925,000 people, 700,000 of whom will be stationed domestically. In addition, there are 340,000 Fascist troops, and 200,000 conscripts from the 1912 class who can be mobilized at any time. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>San Remo, Italy: Residents here were very excited to hear that the Prime Minister had ordered the mobilization of the "Corseria Division." The whole city was covered with national flags, and slogans were posted on the walls expressing support for Prime Minister Mussolini and the troops heading to East Africa. Last night, all public and private buildings were decorated with lights, and the scene was lively. Thousands of citizens paraded in formation to pay their respects in front of the "Monument to the Fallen Soldiers" and sang revolutionary songs. The secretary of the local Fascist Party branch and the president of the Veterans Association gave speeches, both claiming that Italy has the right to extend its influence to Abyssinia. In addition, in the cities of Ventimiglia, Holzhirara, Imperia, and other towns in this province, residents have expressed the same sentiments. Currently, no fewer than several thousand people are volunteering for military service every day. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) Italian Colonial Minister Lesanna, on his way back to the country from Massawa, told a reporter from the Paris Daily that Eritrea's achievements in the last six months have far surpassed those of the past fifty years. The area previously had only one road from Massawa to Asmara. Now, in addition to the railway, there are already three roads. In addition, there is an asphalt road being built to Jigamara, which is now 125 kilometers complete. Bridges and tunnels have been built, and wells have been dug. The railway from Massawa to Ginda will be completed in September. In response to the question of the high mortality rate of the troops, Mr. Li said that a total of 113 workers and 77 soldiers have died in Eritrea and Somalia to date.

<p>(Paris) Abyssinian King A sat at his desk in the lower level of a special new palace, filled with documents and telegrams, and met with a special Reuters reporter. Except for the reporter, no one else was present. King A, dressed in a gorgeous black shirt, apologized to the reporter for receiving guests in this attire, saying that the situation was serious and he had no time to think about clothing. When the reporter asked what the King would do once the war broke out, the King replied, "It is our country's tradition that I must be the commander-in-chief of the army. Although I strive to respect pacifism, I do not want to evade the sacred responsibility of leading the army to defend our freedom and territory." The reporter continued to ask whether the King would accept any form of economic control of Abyssinia by the League of Nations. The King replied that the League of Nations has repeatedly provided valuable economic and social assistance to its member states without limiting their political independence. Therefore, I should not refuse this kind of assistance. Those who are familiar with the situation in our country know that if war breaks out, Abyssinia is not in danger. The Abyssinian government is now considering implementing special plans to protect the lives and property of foreigners in the event of war or troop movements. The reporter asked if the King would be willing to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Italy or Abyssinia. The King replied that no one has proposed this suggestion yet. If there is one, I will certainly consider it. The King also told the reporter that although he is determined to do everything in his power to maintain peace, if Italian troops invade Abyssinian territory, he intends to lead the people to fight bravely. The King now works 18 hours a day and is very well-informed about current events. Leaders of tribes from all over the country now come to the palace to see him every day, all stating that they are willing to be loyal to the King and serve him, and asking for supplies of arms and ammunition. The King is now doing his best to supply them, but it is no secret that Abyssinia currently lacks various weapons. As for troop movements and other war preparation plans, secrecy is now strictly maintained to prevent news from spreading abroad. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Inspection of Flood Conditions on Rivers, Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya: One Night in Huangjia Bridge <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Zhongxiang County, upstream of Shayang, with the breaching of the Three Gorges Lion's Mouth, has already caused disaster to Tianmen, Hanchuan, and other counties, turning them entirely into a watery expanse. However, the flow is merciless, rushing in all directions, causing considerable damage to Zhongxiang itself. According to investigations, the major disaster in the county occurred on the night of July 6th (the further upstream, the earlier the flood season, and the disaster telegrams received by the provincial government also follow the water source order, upstream first and then downstream). Gale-force winds and torrential rain continued all night. The next day, the dikes and embankments below Jiangjia Temple successively collapsed, with floodwaters pouring into the city, instantly reaching depths of several feet. The county government building was flooded up to the eaves, and all land tax documents were lost. Residents fled without escape, with countless deaths. The collapse of houses was even more countless. Further up the river, places like Yicheng, Xiangyang, Gucheng, Guanghua, Jun County, Yun County, and Yunxi, all counties within the Xiang River basin, were all disaster areas of the Xiang River floods. Only the severity of the disaster varied slightly. The reporter originally planned to travel along the river to Xiangfan, then take the Xiang (Yang) Hua (Yuan) Road to the Pinghan Railway north, but above Shayang, boats cannot sail. The inland waterway navigation operated by the Hubei Provincial Construction Department only sails to Shayang. If switching to smaller boats, it would not only take more time, but the security of the waterways above Zhongxiang is also quite questionable. In the end, I changed my route from Shayang to Yuekou, disembarked, and detoured to Tianmen for inspection, then returned to Hankou and went directly north on the Pinghan Railway.</p>
<p>When the boat sailed from Shayang to Yuekou, it went downstream very quickly. It was noon, and I often saw groups of three or five people on the street looking up at the sky, mumbling and sighing in fear. The reporter also looked up with the crowd and suddenly saw a star in the middle of the sky, which, even under the daylight, still shone brilliantly in all directions. After the heavy rain, the weather was clear, or it might have been that the star's orbit was in a certain position. Therefore, it could suddenly be seen in broad daylight. The people on the street did not understand and made wild guesses about disasters. The thought was probably stimulated too deeply by the floods, which led to a case of being scared by shadows.</p>
<p>Yuekou is forty li from Tianmen. Originally, it was a land route, but after the major disaster, it required both land and water travel. I first hired a rickshaw to travel along the winding paths. The vegetable gardens and soybean fields passed had once been flooded in low-lying areas. Because it was a flood, it had neither the benefit of rain nor the harm of silty wasteland. There had been no rain for the past two weeks, and the blazing sun was raging, causing the ground to crack and the crops to wither. Farmers were working hard to draw water, some by hand and some by foot. The sounds of the water wheels arose everywhere in the fields, no different from a tragic cry of drought coming after the flood. Others weeding were in teams of more than ten, wearing straw hats and holding long hoes, sitting or standing, hoeing and retreating. The operation was very laborious, but the pace was quite relaxed. From time to time, I heard high-pitched farming songs, saying, "...Farmers don't see money from farming, while wealthy city dwellers can't finish eating. Alas, the dragon turns over, the sky connects to the water, the water connects to the sky, and ninety thousand out of one hundred thousand farming households are running out of food. Let's go, let's go, alas, don't let go of the hoe, alas, eat Hankou first, alas, then go down to Yangzhou, alas..." The singing method was one person singing alone in front, with everyone singing in chorus behind, the melody tragic and the lyrics clear and audible.</p>
<p>That day was extremely hot and windless. The temperature must have been above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The ridges of the fields and the dikes were rugged and uneven. I got out of the car to walk. When encountering slopes, the car could not climb, so I had to carry it with the rickshaw puller. Because I had luggage, I could not send the car away to go alone, resulting in being drenched in sweat. Farmers and passersby mostly took shelter in the shade of trees. Nearby, villagers provided hot tea for people to drink freely. After passing by and resting briefly, I heard them chatting, saying that Yuekou was the only place in Tianmen County spared from the disaster, thanks to the heroic efforts of the stationed troops in rushing to rescue the situation. There were two parts of the stationed troops, one belonging to the 105th Division, which did not boast of its merits or brag about its abilities, and the people greatly respected and appreciated them. The other belonged to the ×× Division, which had taken the opportunity to extort money from the people. Although they have now worked hard to rescue the situation and achieved results, in the hearts of the people, the shortcomings still outweigh the merits. Furthermore, Commissioner and Tianmen County Magistrate Shi Yuling, some people had seen him with muddy feet supervising the work of rushing to rescue the situation, and they praised him unanimously as a good official. As the ancients said, what the people hear is what Heaven hears.</p>
<p>Fifteen li to Jie River, with a population of about five or six hundred families, living on a high and long embankment, supposedly a regular market. However, the goods sold did not include cloth or grain, mostly small stalls with snacks, such as fried dough sticks and cooked tofu. Those selling pigs all pierced their left ears with thick ropes, which was quite different from the methods of bundling the four hooves in North China and caging the entire body in Guangdong and Guangxi. But the ultimate goal was the same: to drive these dull creatures, raised fat and lazy, to the slaughterhouse. Walking through the embankment street, I stopped to look into the distance. The vast expanse of water in front was unknown for hundreds of miles. Villages where the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard in the past were now scattered and floating like sandy islands. Fertile fields that were once connected by paths are now turned into ponds and ditches where fish and shrimp chase each other. At that time, Wu, the chief of the second district of Tianmen, was directing boatmen to rush to transport sacks to the city. According to him, "The disaster situation in that district, such as Songjia River Ridge, Li Jiawan, Yanglin Jiawan, Luotai Jiawan, Xin Jiawan, and Zhong Jiawan, all experienced a two-zhang rise in water overnight. The disaster situation is extremely tragic. According to investigations, more than 360 houses have been completely washed away, 140 men and women have died, and 420,000 mu of fields have been flooded. In Songjia River Ridge village, with a population of more than 100 families, only three houses remained after the flooding, blocked by willows. Most of the villagers who were saved were also washed and hung on high branches."</p>
<p>Buying a boat to go to the city, no one responded to Wu's offer to hire a small boat at a high price. It was still a returning boat carrying bamboo and wood. It was not until we were paddling in the water (actually paddling over the fields) that I learned that a few days ago, two men and a woman hired a small boat and, in the middle of the journey, suddenly drew their knives and killed the boatman, seizing the boat and fleeing. The boatman was a father and son. The son died, and the old man was pushed into the water. They then hit the old man with an oar, but the oar broke without hitting him. The old man pretended to be dead to escape. In the dark night, he called for help and returned to chase. The stolen boat was difficult to maneuver with only one oar. Seeing the chasing boat approaching, they fled into the reeds and were eventually captured. They were then shot in the county. The woman was a kidnapped disaster victim from Mianyang and is currently imprisoned. Since this incident, everyone has been warned not to hire laborers or boats for longer distances. To think that someone would have murderous intent for a small boat worth a dozen yuan, killing and being killed, a total of three lives lost, is also regrettable. However, due to the impact of the flood, unexpected tragedies may not be limited to this. As the ancients said, after a major disaster, war is likely to break out. Prevention is key, and all places should have taken note of this.</p>
<p>When the boat first set off, the trees seen had large branches and trunks, hanging with furniture and old clothes washed away by the water, swaying and scattered, much like the colorful masts erected in a theatrical stage. Those with lush branches and leaves and short trunks were all lying prostrate in the flood, drifting like algae. After passing five or six villages, the remaining empty houses and rafters were inhabited by waterbirds. When the boat arrived, they flew away in a disorderly manner. The ground was covered with rubble and the smell of rotting grass. The odor was like garbage but not garbage, like a fish market but not a fish market, making people nauseous and unbearable for a moment. The graves around the village were numerous, gradually appearing above the water, but many coffins had been exposed, making the scene even more desolate. The setting sun sank into the water, and the sky turned dark. I vaguely saw someone waving a fan in a village house. The boatman said that it was still three or four li from the city, and it was not convenient to proceed in the dark on a non-official waterway. He invited me to spend the night at his house, the place where I vaguely saw someone waving a fan. The village was called Huangjia Bridge, and landing on shore made the darkness even more intense due to the loss of reflection from the water surface. Huangjia Bridge was a fishing village by the river, with eight or nine households. Only three families who had fled the disaster had returned. None of them lit lamps. The boatman's wife had already prepared dinner in the open air. I was invited to eat with them. There were several earthenware bowls. The boatman pointed to them with his chopsticks one by one and said, "There are only four things: chili peppers, mashed broad beans, purslane, and thin millet porridge. There is no oil or salt, and it is tasteless. I am afraid it will make you suffer." After dinner, neighbors came to talk, eagerly asking whether Hankou had escaped danger and when the breached dikes would be repaired. Later, the boatman asked his wife to sleep on the boat while he accompanied the reporter to sleep in the room. The four walls had been washed down by the water. Only the rear part had a bamboo bed, tied to the beams and pillars of the house with ropes to a large stone mortar (a heavy tool for pressing grain). Therefore, it was not washed away. The weather was extremely hot and humid. The boatman advised, "There is no one else in the house. You may as well take off your clothes and sleep. If you have valuables, you can put them under your pillow." Although this came from good intentions, the special environment increased the reporter's fear, so I dared not close my eyes all night. There was no wind or waves in the night, and all was silent, except for the chirping of autumn insects, like playing mourning music for the disaster victims. The bedroom was empty, and when I faintly saw the east turn white, I immediately ordered him to get up and row the boat, sending me to Tianmen City.</p>
<p>The Assassination of Liu Zuozhou</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Liu Zuozhou, the commander of the Third Security Corps of Hebei (formerly known as the First Security Corps of the War Zone), was suddenly attacked at the train station in Fengrun County at 3:50 p.m. on the fourth. He lost too much blood and died that night. His troops are temporarily led by Deputy Commander Li Fengyun, Corps Adjutant Sun Zhenhuan, and Secretary-General Zhang Weixiang. In addition to reporting the details of Liu's assassination to the Pingzheng Review Council, the Military Branch, and the Hebei Provincial Government on the fifth, Li Fengyun and others also publicly recommended Liu's uncle, Liu Lesan (the current commander of the cavalry battalion of Liu's troops), to succeed as the corps commander and requested the province to appoint him. From the evening of the fourth, Fengrun County west to Tangshan and east to Shanhaiguan were placed under special alert. More than eighty Japanese soldiers from Shanhaiguan boarded a special train to Fengrun County at 8:05 p.m. on the fourth to assist in searching for the murderers and were on guard at the station. In Guye, Tangshan, Changli, Fengrun County, and Shanhaiguan, whenever a passenger train arrived at the station, the military boarded the train to search for suspicious persons. Yesterday (the fifth), twenty suspects were arrested in Luan County and detained in the security corps headquarters. The Japanese North China Garrison Army paid extreme attention to this matter. At the same time, Umezu, the commander of the Japanese army who went to Shanhaiguan to inspect the troops, immediately sent Ishii, a senior staff officer of the military headquarters working in Shanhaiguan, to Fengrun County to investigate the truth. Wenjing, the captain of the Tangshan Japanese Garrison, also stayed there to assist in everything. Ikeshima, the captain of the Tianjin Japanese Military Police, rushed to Fengrun County on the morning of the fifth to interrogate the arrested criminals in order to find out the truth of the case. The incident occurred as follows: on the morning of the fourth, Gu Ruzhen took office as the administrative inspector of the Fengshan-Shanhaiguan District in Tangshan. At the same time, Umezu went from Tianjin to Shanhaiguan to inspect the Japanese army. Liu Zuozhou went to Tangshan to participate in Gu's inauguration ceremony and welcome Umezu. At 2:30 p.m., he boarded the train from Tangshan. When Umezu headed east and arrived in Fengrun County, Wenjing, the captain of the Tangshan Japanese Garrison, was in the same car as Liu. After Umezu left with the train, they left the station together. Liu was about to board his own car when suddenly more than ten thugs jumped out of the station and fired and bombarded Liu at the same time, throwing two bombs. Liu was hit by bullets in the chest and waist and fell to the ground. Three of his attendants were also injured. The station security team heard the gunshots and bombings, and the thugs took the opportunity to escape. Stray bullets injured Kitamura, a senior soldier in the Japanese military police auxiliary team who was on duty at the station. For a time, the order at the station was chaotic. Wenjing directed the Japanese military police garrison to assist the security team in arresting the thugs. At that time, three suspicious persons were captured. The injured Liu Zuozhou was carried to the station railway hospital, where he died at 6 p.m. due to excessive blood loss. Fengrun County was placed under curfew that night, the city gates were closed, and telephone lines were temporarily cut off, but the people in the city were still stable. Liu Zuozhou was a native of Gaiping, Liaoning, 33 years old, and a graduate of the tenth class of infantry at the Northeast Jiangwutang. He served as a junior officer in the Northeast Army. During the Rehe Incident, Li Jichun gathered desperadoes and Lao Haozi bandit gangs to disturb eastern Shanhaiguan. After being recruited, Li Jichun was sent away, and Lao Haozi also fled outside the pass. The two units were then reorganized into the First and Second Security Corps of the War Zone. The Second Security Corps was commanded by Zhao Lei, and the Japanese side recommended Liu to serve as the commander of the First Security Corps. Since the new security team of the war zone changed defenses, the Japanese side again requested that Changli and Leting be the defense areas of Liu's troops. Including Fengrun County, the defense area expanded, and the power gradually expanded. The reason for this assassination is unknown, but it is said that Liu Guitang, Qi Wenping, and others gathered bandits outside the Great Wall, wanting to disturb the war zone and demanding that Liu (Zuozhou) cooperate. Liu refused and sent people to incite Liu's troops, but they were captured by Liu. Therefore, they formed a grudge and took action to plot against him, hoping that after Liu's death, the troops would be divided, and then they would take the opportunity to incite them. (6th)</p>
<p>The Yellow Peril is Spreading; The Xiaofu River Breaches Again; Huantai County Suffers Heavy Losses; The Water Level in Shanzhou Rises Suddenly</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River in Shandong breached at Dongzhuang in the upper reaches, and the floodwaters spread, affecting more than ten counties in western Shandong, causing a tragic disaster. As the Yellow Peril is spreading, the Xiaofu River in Huantai County, western Shandong, downstream from the Ma Da Lake to the Xiaoqing River, also breached due to excessive rainfall and a sudden rise in accumulated water. Nearby towns and villages were all submerged, and the disaster also affected Changshan County. Wang Yuanyi, the magistrate of Huantai County, has telegraphed the province requesting funds to rescue the disaster victims. Although the water level of the Xiaoqing River in Gaoyuan County has slightly decreased in recent days, it has not yet escaped danger. The special commissioner of the county came to the province to collect sacks, and the Department of Civil Affairs issued them to the commissioner on the third to carry back to the county for emergency repairs.</p>
<p>After the Yellow River in Shanzhou rose sharply on the fourth, it quickly receded. On the fifth, the River Affairs Bureau received a report from the Shanzhou Hydrological Station that at zero hour on the fifth, the water level suddenly rose to 294.14 meters, with a flow rate of 5,850 cubic meters per second, which was very turbulent. The River Affairs Bureau has reported to the provincial government and telegraphed the section chiefs and county magistrates along the river to pay close attention to prevention. On the fifth, the upper and middle reaches of the province also reported rising water levels, while the lower reaches had stable water levels, indicating that the water situation is still serious.

<p>A Macabre Parricide Case in Songjiang</p>
<p>Zhang Xue, a 64-year-old midwife from the sixth household of the fourteenth jia of the fifth bao in Mojia Lane outside the West Gate of this county, is the wife of the late resident Zhang Zhaosheng. Zhang had opened the Xinghua Village candy store at the entrance of Mojia Lane during his lifetime. Because he had no children, he adopted a son named Shunxi, who is now 22 years old and married to a Wang woman. Unexpectedly, Shunxi became degenerate and showed no ambition. The Zhang couple were deeply disappointed. On the fifth day of the lunar year last year, Zhang, saddened by his son's unworthiness, secretly took an overdose of tranquilizer water and died. Unexpectedly, after Shunxi's father passed away, he became even more reckless, arbitrarily mistreating his wife and elderly mother, and constantly extorting money from his mother. Therefore, the Xinghua Village candy store he opened could not be maintained and was closed. His wife, Wang, also left. Shunxi then associated with loafers and wandered outside. At the end of May this year, Shunxi again extorted money from his mother. When she refused, he severely beat her, causing injuries to her face. She reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which sent him to the County Court for trial on charges of assault and sentenced him to imprisonment for several months, sending him to prison for execution. Until the fifth of this month, Shunxi was released from prison after serving his term. Unexpectedly, at about 12 o'clock that night, two men whom his mother, Xue, did not recognize suddenly came and claimed to invite Xue to deliver a baby. Xue did not think twice and went with them. Before leaving, she entrusted Fang Wenh and Zhang Zhengyou, two people living in the same house, to watch over the door and told them that if the knife was released from prison today and came home to stay, please refuse him. Unexpectedly, less than an hour after Xue left, Shunxi suddenly came with Xue's room key. He immediately opened the lock and searched Xue's room for money and valuables. At that time, the residents asked him where he got the key. According to him, he accidentally met his mother on the road, who gave him the key and told him to go home to sleep. The residents considered that Xue's words before leaving were contradictory and became suspicious. That night, Shunxi stayed in his mother's room. The next day, Xue still did not return home, and Shunxi got up and rummaged through things as usual. The two residents, Fang Wenh and Zhang Zhengyou, became even more suspicious. Therefore, they joined Zhang Yongsheng, the town police officer, to report to the Second Public Security Sub-bureau and requested them to send police to stop him from taking things. The sub-bureau sent police chief Yang Zhiquan. At that time, because his behavior was suspicious, he took Shunxi to the station so that he could be verified after Xue returned home. Unexpectedly, at about 1 p.m. today (the 7th), Zhang Yuanbiao, a direct-action policeman from the station, was passing through a remote place in the second district of Zui Bai Chi South River and suddenly saw several children shouting that a female corpse had been found on the public cemetery. The policeman went to check and indeed saw a female corpse, about 60 years old, with her upper body naked and a cloth belt tied around her throat, lying dead among the trees. It was clear that she had been murdered. The policeman reported it to the Second Sub-bureau. After the corpse was discovered, someone recognized it as Zhang Xue and suspected that her son had murdered her. The sub-bureau telegraphed the Public Security Bureau and the District Attorney's Office to send personnel to examine the corpse. At the same time, Officer Luo ordered Zhang Shunxi to be brought to court for a preliminary interrogation. At first, Shunxi tried to deny that he had murdered his mother, but then he confessed that because he was at odds with his mother and was plotting to get her money, he colluded with two people who were released from prison with him. First, the two men tricked his mother out, and then they strangled her to death with a belt. While speaking, his eyes were fierce, his attitude was arrogant, and he said that there was no need to ask more questions, it was nothing to die. Officer Luo ordered him to be detained. At about 3 p.m., Liu, the prosecutor from the District Attorney's Office, led Wang, the prosecuting clerk, and others to the scene of the corpse in the rain to examine it. After examination, it was determined that the deceased, Zhang Xue, was indeed strangled to death. He filled out the corpse form and instructed Xu Yongqing, the rural policeman of the second district of the river, to guard the corpse so that the family members could come to collect it for burial. The murderer, Zhang Shunxi, was reported by the Second Sub-bureau to the General Bureau for verification.</p>
<p>Haime Investigation of Illegal Collection of Docking Fees</p>
<p>Xu Hanchun of Da'an Port, Mao Aiqing of Niuhong Port, and Liu Dingxin of Songji Port in this county relied on their evil influence to illegally collect docking fees from passing ships. Shipowners such as Zhang Zhaoyuan, Zhu Wenxing, and Lu Chaoliang jointly petitioned the Finance Department to investigate. The Finance Department believes that all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in various counties have been abolished, but these people dare to defy the decrees and illegally collect docking fees, which is extremely illegal. They specifically ordered the county government to strictly investigate and handle the matter. After receiving the order, the county government sent personnel to secretly investigate and found it to be true. Yesterday, the police were ordered to arrest Xu Hanchun and others, interrogate them, and take them into custody.</p>

<p>The East-West Zhongshi Market inside the Lu Gate is the commercial center of Suzhou City. Banks and money shops are lined up one after another. Recently, the Construction Bureau widened the East-West Zhongshi Market to fourteen meters. However, due to financial constraints, the sidewalks on both sides were built with cobblestones. Each store there, concerned with appearances, advocated changing to cement. They sent representatives to petition the County Chamber of Commerce. Cheng Ganqing, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, visited Zhou, the director of the Construction Bureau, yesterday (the 7th) morning, requesting the reconstruction with cement. The required funds, in addition to the proceeds from the sale of the original stone materials in the East-West Zhongshi Market, will be raised by each store if there is a shortfall.

<p>A Bizarre Death of a Ferry Boat Owner in Wuxi</p>
<p>Fan Aquan, a 34-year-old farmer from Beixingtang in the seventh district, usually operated a ferry boat between Wuxi and Beixingtang and also traded in wheat. Recently, wheat prices fell, resulting in heavy losses. The day before yesterday, at about 10 o'clock at night, Aquan went to Beiyu Lane to collect scattered wheat. He returned to Beixingtang at about 2 o'clock and stayed on the ferry boat. The next morning, at about 7 o'clock, villagers glimpsed Aquan sleeping soundly on the bow of the boat, naked and sunburned without waking up. Everyone thought it was strange. Looking down, they saw Aquan's face was pale, with saliva all over his mouth, and his legs were purple and his flesh was peeling off. Touching him, he was already stiff. There seemed to be rope marks on his neck. Everyone was in an uproar, with various rumors spreading. Some said that Aquan's death was bizarre, perhaps he was assassinated and strangled, and there were knife wounds on his lower body. Others said that Aquan committed suicide by taking poison due to heavy losses from wheat trading. His concubine, A Xiaomei, came out to collect the corpse.</p>
<p>Fears of a Lack of Autumn Silkworm Eggs in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>The autumn silkworm season is approaching. This year, Jiangsu Province produced about 800,000 purebred silkworm eggs (1 million rough eggs), while the estimated quantity needed by each county in the province is about 600,000. However, Zhejiang Province needs to purchase about 270,000 from Jiangsu Province. It is estimated that Jiangsu Province will be short of 100,000 eggs. The Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Management Committee, to prepare for contingencies, adopted the suggestion of Zhou Yuanxun, deputy director of the Wuxi Model District, and ordered 50,000 autumn silkworm eggs from the association for relief in areas lacking eggs. At the same time, it ordered each district to quickly guide silkworm farmers to order eggs. Each breeding farm was informed that because Jiangsu Province's demand for eggs was pressing, they could only reduce the quantity shipped to Zhejiang by 100,000 eggs, so Jiangsu Province no longer has a shortage of eggs. However, Zhejiang Province estimates that the quantity of autumn silkworm eggs needed is about 500,000 to 600,000, while its output is only about 200,000. The total shortage will reach 200,000 eggs, causing great panic. The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department is currently discussing remedial measures.</p>
<p>Regulations on Wage for Silk Reeling Workers</p>
<p>The Silk Factory Association of this county held the first second member representative conference yesterday, chaired by Qian Fenghao, to discuss the following matters: the wages of female workers and working hours varied from factory to factory, and a unified method should be specified.

The time is uniformly set at 5:00 a.m. to go to work and 6:30 p.m. to leave work, with a quarter of an hour stop for breakfast and one hour for lunch. The association will notify each factory to follow the instructions immediately. It was also heard that prices in overseas counties and cities have risen. For example, 85-point Ivina silk can be sold for 500 yuan, and 83-point can be sold for 490 yuan. The household silk of 17-point and 75-point can be sold for 440 yuan, an increase of more than 100 yuan compared to the lowest period in the silk market. The current market price of dry hemp is 118 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>Xu Juxi, the chairman of the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, previously requested a two-month leave of absence due to illness. The Standing Committee decided to retain him, and if the duties were heavy, each Standing Committee member would be assigned to assist. However, Xu's attitude was passive. Later, he went to Hankou for business and was unable to attend meetings to preside over matters.

<p>Fengxian County Government Sets Up a Land Survey Office</p>
<p>The county government is currently organizing the county's tax quota and correcting household grain. It has specifically approved the provincial department to conduct a land survey. All cases of wasteland, extinct households, land without grain, land with too much grain, land with too little grain, and households with grain but no land must apply for registration before October of this year so that they can be corrected, transferred, supplemented with taxes, and exempted from grain at the appropriate time.

In order to avoid errors and achieve rapid results, a land survey registration office is attached to the second section of the county government to assign personnel to specialize in the matter. If any concealment or omission is discovered, it will be severely punished. It has been announced to the public yesterday.</p>
<p>Mediation of a Case of Injury Caused by a French Car is Underway</p>
<p>The Frenchman, Fuliya, was driving his own car, Shanghai City No. 5014, on the 4th, and started from Hangzhou. In the area of Lujia Wharf in Zhalin, a village woman, Zhang Xuezhen, was injured. The tax police at the scene stopped him and brought him back. In addition to sending the injured woman to Nanting Public Hospital for treatment, one party, along with the offending car, reported to the County Public Security Bureau for temporary custody. Yesterday, the Westerner came to Fengxian with Chen Zhiqing, the inspector of the Shanghai French Concession Police, to conduct mediation. The Zhang family requested a compensation fee of 1,000 yuan as compensation, because although the woman's injury was minor, according to the doctor's diagnosis, she was pregnant and had a high fever, and there was a risk of danger. The Westerner saw that the matter was difficult to settle and asked the authorities to return the car first. County Magistrate Yang Zhuomao politely declined and left without results. Later, it was learned that Inspector Chen had persuaded Yang Sanhe, the representative of the Zhang family, before leaving, and agreed to come again tomorrow to discuss it further.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Bans National Goods Mobile Sales Group</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, according to letters from businesses such as silk cloth, general merchandise, and clothing, recently had a National Goods Mobile Sales Group that planned to build a reed shed on the open space at the entrance of Yingjiang Road as a temporary market and had applied to the competent authorities for a building permit. The industries are panicked, and they believe that Zhenjiang's commerce has suffered disasters and losses, and the pain is deep. The long summer is even more of a case of having goods but no buyers, and they hope to see some improvement in the autumn to reduce the burden of losses. If they are invaded by outsiders and their business is divided, allowing them to seize a large amount of cash and leave, the industries will only perish together and have no way to survive. On the 2nd of this month, the Construction Department convened a meeting of industries throughout the province. Regarding the issue of preventing mobile sales, it was decided that local industry associations must issue permits and submit them to the local government for record. Unexpectedly, the ink was not dry, and someone dared to risk the disapproval of others and damage the case. They specifically jointly sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting the provincial and county party and government agencies to be telegraphed to strictly prevent it in order to relieve the business difficulties and maintain the market. The association has telegraphed the provincial and county party and government agencies on its behalf to strictly prevent it in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and maintain the market.</p>

<h3 id="e65">The Italian-Abyssinian Peace Hangs by a Thread, London Sources are Pessimistic, the Trilateral Negotiations are Unlikely to Succeed, Economic Sanctions May Be Implemented <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>(London) Generally, people are pessimistic about the situation regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has again ordered the mobilization of two army divisions, indicating his determination to act on his word, regardless of the opposition from the League of Nations. Semi-official sources believe that even if Britain, France, and Italy hold negotiations on the Abyssinian question in Paris, based on the steps agreed upon in Geneva, success is unlikely if Italy is only given economic benefits without compromising Abyssinia's political independence. Conversely, if Italy insists on its current course and wages war against Abyssinia, Britain will be forced to request the League of Nations to impose sanctions on Italy. Well-informed sources believe that only economic sanctions are feasible, such as blockading the Suez Canal. The League of Nations' position on the Italian-Abyssinian issue differs from its position on the Sino-Japanese dispute over Manchuria. Economic sanctions against Italy are still possible today, unlike the inability to effectively reach Japan. Sources in Geneva believe that at that time, all member states of the League of Nations could concentrate their navies to form an international fleet to enhance the effectiveness of the blockade if the League decides to blockade the Suez Canal.

<p>Alexandria Newspapers here attach great importance to the Prime Minister's recent declaration that Egypt will take the same stance as Britain should the Italian-Abyssinian war break out. The Prime Minister's secretary also confirmed this statement to reporters from Egypt's three major newspapers yesterday. When asked about British military preparations in the Suez Canal, the secretary replied that he was not authorized to discuss the matter. The press believes this response confirms that the naval base in the Suez Canal is expanding along the coast to ensure the canal's own security and improve its management. The secretary also told the press that a peace group here held a meeting at which a director of the British Victoria School spoke and expressed sympathy for Abyssinia. Italian reporters attempted to protest but were stopped. Dockworkers in Port Said have resolved not to load or unload cargo for Italian ships if the Italian-Abyssinian war breaks out.

<p>Brussels According to the Belgian People's Daily, Belgian Senator Toro held a speech at the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee today on the second European War, which mentioned that once war breaks out, Germany will surpass the Franco-Belgian allied forces by 25 to 30 percent in terms of numbers and will far surpass Franco-Belgian forces in terms of military equipment. As for the air force, although the combined forces of France, Belgium, and Britain are stronger than Germany, if delayed for another two or three years, Germany's strength in this area will reverse the situation. Finally, Toro advocated strengthening the Franco-Belgian military alliance while actively seeking economic cooperation between the two countries. Belgian Prime Minister Xu Lun neither affirmed nor denied what Toro said, only stating that Franco-Belgian economic negotiations are currently underway. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>

<p>Brest, France Since the government promulgated the delegated legal decree on implementing austerity measures on the 17th of last month, civil servants' salaries have been paid at 90% across the board. Upon hearing that this discount method was implemented when paying the first half-month's wages today, arsenal workers suddenly launched a demonstration against the government's measures. Six thousand workers from the factory participated in the demonstration, with three thousand demonstrators, causing disturbances and a serious situation. The demonstrating workers first gathered near the railway, preventing the express train to Paris from departing, ordering the locomotive workers to stop the train, removing the locomotive, and forcing it to return to the factory. They then marched in a group to the county government and gathered in front of it, tearing down the tricolor flag and replacing it with a red flag. County Governor Henry walked alone into the county government courtyard and removed the red flag. The crowd in front of the government shouted loudly and threw bricks at the government's glass windows. At that time, shops in the main streets closed their shop windows one after another. The demonstrating workers then went from the county government to the naval defense bureau, attempting to break in, but were forcibly stopped by the guarding cavalry and regular troops before retreating. A naval military vehicle was burned in the Sadi Carnot Square. The naval headquarters was guarded by gunners and riflemen and was not attacked by the workers. The disturbances did not completely subside until 6:15 pm. After investigation, one worker was seriously injured and died in the hospital. Two patrol team soldiers were seriously injured and several were slightly injured. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<p>Dockworkers Join the Riot</p>
<p>(Paris) Dockworkers in Brest clashed with police last night in a new conflict. Striking workers marched into the city in formation, shouting slogans such as "Down with Laval" and "Long live the Soviets," destroying many windows and burning naval vehicles, and not allowing the rescue team to provide assistance. The center of the chaos was the Siam Road. Demonstrators repeatedly broke through police cordons here, attempting to break into the police station. The gate of the police station has been destroyed by them. When their forces were no match for the police, they set up obstacles but were dispersed by the cavalry. According to a communique issued by the Ministry of the Interior, Brest's security was restored at 8 pm last night. Among the twenty people injured, there were five policemen and two gendarmes. One dockworker who participated in the struggle today has died from his injuries, and the number of minor injuries is more than one hundred. Today, newspapers are full of news of this riot.

<p>Brest, France Workers employed by the government's shipbuilding and arsenal have abandoned the construction of the Dunkerque warship today and have rioted, protesting the government's recent austerity plans and wage cuts. At the same time, the arsenal here has also closed its doors, so there are many riots in the streets. Large groups of military police fought fiercely with the workers for an hour before order could be restored to the streets near the arsenal. However, there are still riots on the main road "Siam Road". At least one person has died and many have been injured. The workers want to incite the army and cause a revolution, so the authorities here have declared martial law today. By evening, the battle between the military police and the workers has not subsided. The authorities have arrested a large number of workers. In addition, 1,200 electrical workers and 500 gas workers have also risen up in riot. According to the police station, this disturbance was instigated by the Communist Party.

<p>Impact on the London Exchange Market</p>
<p>(London) Opposition to France's austerity orders, resulting in riots in Brest, and street fighting in Paris and Toulon, caused the London foreign exchange market, which had just recovered from a recent currency panic, to panic over the franc. The Central Bank's equalization fund had to buy francs in large quantities. Speculators believe that if France has difficulties in cutting salaries, the Netherlands will be even less able to implement salary cuts. Those in the Netherlands who advocate reducing the value of the currency are now rewarded for their efforts, especially in the Rotterdam area. British bankers are not currently worried about the disturbances in France, but they fear that the spread will cause many congressmen to abandon austerity policies. The election period is approaching, so this change is particularly noteworthy. This autumn will be the most difficult period for Prime Minister Laval. According to many people, the fate of the Laval cabinet will depend on Herriot's actions. Herriot is considered by people in Paris to be the protagonist in the French political situation.

<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, who has gained domestic and international trust for his conciliatory diplomacy, believes that if personnel matters within the ministry adopt a well-rounded, warm-hearted approach, the dissatisfaction of the backbone department will be enough to affect morale. Therefore, he has decided to make major adjustments this autumn and has already started preparations. The reason why more than 70 people in the third rank have not yet been promoted is that 30 to 40 diplomats were employed during the good times of Taisho 8 and 9, a number roughly the same as administrative officials. Because of this attitude, there are also old and weak diplomats in the third rank who should be reorganized. On the one hand, there is a fixed number of Chokunin officials, and capable people in the third rank have no way to advance. Therefore, this autumn, Ambassador Takeo Kojiro to Germany, Matsunaga, Aoki, Fujita, Okamoto, Yamazaki, Murakami, Yano, and other ministers, councilors, and consul-level officials, numbering more than a dozen, who have returned home, will be reorganized and replaced by young and energetic people to transform the atmosphere inside and outside the ministry.

<p>(Washington) After Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito protested against the cartoon in the fashionable magazine The New Yorker mocking the Japanese Emperor, another unpleasant incident was discovered in the magazine today. In addition to the cartoon, there was another picture titled "Famous Parents," which included famous parents who had children in 1934. The Japanese Embassy believes that although there is nothing wrong with including the Japanese Emperor in this group of ordinary people, it is "too unsightly." At the same time, the Washington Post today drew a humorous cartoon in its satirical column mocking Japan's protest against the aforementioned cartoon. The picture shows Roosevelt pulling a car with the words "Balanced Budget" written on it, and the title is "Another Situation Britain Must Have." Furthermore, Washington newspapers all commented that Japan's protest would do more harm than good to US-Japan relations and was unwise. The Washington Post said that since Japan protested against the cartoon in The New Yorker, newspapers and publications across the United States have reprinted it, drawing the attention of people across the country. If Japan could have tolerated it, not many people would have paid attention to the cartoon. The newspaper said in an editorial that Japanese soldiers believe that protesting will increase the Emperor's divinity and encourage people to sacrifice more for military service, but they do not know that this kind of protest does not have this effect. The Washington Post believes that from the American point of view, this kind of magazine cartoon does not insult Japan or the Japanese Emperor. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

After joining, there will only be some unimportant territories left, and there will be no need to set up a separate department. If the government divides the department to deal with these matters, it will be necessary to add twenty or thirty more departments. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Zhu Hexiang, the newly appointed Chinese Minister to Belgium, departed yesterday afternoon aboard the Conte Verde, a vessel of the Italian Mail Steamship Company, to transit through Italy and then proceed to Belgium to take up his new post. Many of Mr. Zhu's relatives and friends went to the dock to see him off. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure Yesterday Afternoon: Minister Zhu boarded the Conte Verde of the Italian Mail Steamship Company at 12:30 PM on the 7th to depart for his new post. Among those who went to the North Bund Wharf to see him off were Zhao Tiezhang, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Mr. Taillevoix, Counselor of the Belgian Legation, and many of Mr. Zhu's relatives and friends. Besides Mr. Zhou Bofu, the legation secretary who accompanied him, Minister Zhu was also accompanied by his wife, three sons, two daughters, and a servant. Minister Zhu is expected to arrive in Brussels at the beginning of next month to arrange for the early presentation of his credentials.</p>
<p>Statement Released: Minister Zhu stated to reporters from various newspapers before his departure, "I studied in Belgium for seven years and have been back in China for over twenty years. Many of my former classmates in Belgium are now serving in the government. The Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Meng Qilang, is a graduate of the University of Leuven and was also my classmate. There are also many well-known figures in political, academic, financial, industrial, and commercial circles who are old acquaintances. This time, revisiting that country and meeting old friends will surely be harmonious both personally and for the nation. Moreover, the relationship between China and Belgium has always been strong, and the Chinese in Belgium live and work in peace. Therefore, my visit will be based on the government's main purpose of maintaining friendly relations and striving for amity between China and Belgium. As for the current international situation of our country, many insightful people in the country have expressed their views extensively, so there is no need for me to elaborate. However, I believe that international relations are based on the premise of national interests. We must maintain orderly steps and deal with the situation prudently. If we act impulsively based on temporary emotions, we will surely ruin major events. This is what I deeply hope that my beloved compatriots can deeply research, learn from others' strengths, overcome weaknesses, and strive for self-improvement, which will greatly benefit the future of the country, and our long-cherished aspiration for peace will surely be realized in the future. I will not delay during this trip to Belgium. I will go directly to the port of Venice in Italy to disembark, which will take twenty-three days. I plan to stay there for one or two days and then take a train directly to Brussels, which will take about twenty-four hours. I may take the opportunity to browse the famous attractions along the way. It is expected that the trip will reach Brussels at the beginning of next month. The staff of the embassy will remain the same, so only the First Secretary, Zhou Bofu, will accompany me. In addition, for the convenience of the children's education, the family will also go together."</p>

<h3 id="e86">Rickshaw Pullers in the French Concession Still on Strike Yesterday: Trade Association Discussed Follow-up Measures Yesterday <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Rickshaw pullers in the French Concession went on strike the day before yesterday to protest against registration and clashed with Annamese police. Yesterday morning, the strike continued. Rickshaw owners petitioned Du Yuesheng again, and the trade association held a general meeting. The Special District Court interrogated the rickshaw pullers who committed the assault and deflated tires. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Continued Strike: There are 7,100 rickshaws and 40,000 rickshaw pullers in the French Concession. Since the strike started the day before yesterday, no satisfactory results have been achieved in the negotiations, and a bloody tragedy has occurred. Therefore, the strike continued yesterday morning. Because the rickshaws in the British Concession were deflated, the rickshaw pullers did not dare to go south and only pulled rickshaws in the French Concession. In Hu Nan, except for places accessible by trams and buses, pedestrians had difficulty finding transportation.</p>
<p>French Consul Expresses: Mr. Du Yuesheng believed that the situation of this case was serious and had a great impact on the traffic and security of the Chinese Concession. Therefore, he visited Mr. Badens, the French Consul General, in his personal capacity to discuss appropriate solutions. The French Consul said that the registration of rickshaw pullers did not start with the French Concession. There were precedents in the British Concession. Why did the rickshaw pullers and owners in the British Concession not object, but only opposed the actions of the French Concession? Moreover, the rickshaw pullers committed violence and injured the Annamese police. Therefore, this case is difficult to change. Mr. Du resigned and left.</p>
<p>Du Mediates: At 9:00 PM on the 6th, the Rickshaw Trade Association sent Standing Committee members Gu Songmao, Yu Dajin, Zhang Huaiyang, and Chou Chunshan to Du's residence again to request mediation. Mr. Du said that he had consulted with the French Consul General. The Consul General was very dissatisfied with the rickshaw pullers for beating and injuring the Annamese police. His opinion was that each rickshaw should register one person first, and he would be responsible for resolving everything else to avoid the expansion of the situation and causing social unrest. The rickshaw owners agreed to reply after the meeting.</p>
<p>Injuries: It has been confirmed that the missing rickshaw puller Xue San (i.e., Xue Ruji) was arrested by the police and has been sent to the court. Zhang Jialong and Han Changsheng were seriously injured. As for the three injured Annamese police, (1) No. 233 was injured in the waist, (2) No. 173 was injured in the back. Both of them were seriously injured and unconscious and are currently staying in Guangci Hospital for treatment. (3) No. 480 was slightly injured and was discharged from the hospital after being bandaged.</p>
<p>General Meeting of Rickshaw Owners: The Rickshaw Trade Association held a general meeting of all rickshaw owners at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 8:00 AM yesterday to discuss follow-up measures. More than 400 rickshaw owners attended. Rickshaw pullers Xu Hongsheng, Zhou Li, and Wu Yigao attended as observers. Jin Changlin from the Special Zone Office and Li Rujing from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended for guidance. Chou Chunshan, Gu Songmao, Zhang Huaiyang, Yu Dajin, Song Yaokun, and other five people served as the presidium. First, Chou Chunshan reported on the negotiations, and then Li Rujing and Gu Songmao delivered speeches.</p>
<p>Court Trial: When the incident occurred the day before yesterday, the French police arrested three rickshaw pullers, Xue Ruji, Li Yuehua, and Xu Xiaosi, and sent them to the Special Second District Court for public prosecution on charges of disturbing order. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Judge Sun Peng, who was authorized, held a trial in the Criminal Eighth Court. After inquiring about their ages and hometowns, he ordered the trial to be postponed to the 14th of this month. At the same time, the police arrested Zhou Guifang, Zhou Peicai, Wang Yongxing, and Zhou Jinhe, who deflated tires, and at 12:10 PM, Judge Sun also tried them in the Eighth Court and ordered the trial to be postponed to 8:00 AM on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Authorities Pay Attention: All circles pay attention to this case because it is related to traffic. The Municipal Government, Mayor Wu, believes that this matter is related to security. Therefore, he ordered the Social Bureau to investigate the truth the day before yesterday and ordered the rickshaw pullers to strictly abide by the order and not expand the situation. Yesterday morning, the Social Bureau sent Director Wang Gang and mediator Zhu Guilin to investigate in detail. The bureau will submit the findings to the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government will formulate solutions based on the bureau's report.</p>
<p>Police Statement: The French police issued a statement yesterday saying that the police can absolutely prove that the Annamese police and reserve police stationed in the Xiejiao area did not open fire on the crowd when the dispute occurred. It is true that the police officers had to fire three shots into the air when the crowd of six or seven hundred people clashed with the Annamese police. (Note: There was no mention in yesterday's newspaper about opening fire on the crowd, so this is a special statement.)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Telephone Bureau Corrects Citizen's Mistake; Fortunately, the Words "Chinese Area" are Not Used <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has been refreshing various facilities in its business operations. Recently, when various users printed letterheads and envelopes and included telephone numbers, some added the words "Chinese Area" between the digits. It seems that their intention is to have a relative position with the word "Concession" added to the telephone numbers in the Special Zone. However, I don't know that this kind of measure has a potential impact on international public opinion and public psychology. The bureau realized that this kind of mistake must be corrected as soon as possible, so it specially sent a letter to all users, stating that in the future, when printing letterheads and envelopes and including the telephone number installed by the bureau, the number should be corrected uniformly, and the words "This City" should be added to the number. As for users in the Special Zone, the words "Special Zone" should also be added for identification, etc. It is heard that this letter will be issued to notify all users within the next few days.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Each County's Shatun Bureau: Provincial Order to End This Month; All Twelve Original Bureaus Abolished; Three Newly Established Bureaus to be Implemented on September 1 <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to Shiye News Agency, the Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government has ordered the Shangbao and other bureaus to comply with the deadline to abolish all official Shatun property bureaus within its territory due to poor management. Three new bureaus will be established and implemented on September 1. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Provincial Government Order: Deadline for Abolition</p>
<p>Chen Guofu, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, has now received a report from Zhao Dihua, Director of the Finance Department, stating that the original twelve official Shatun property bureaus were established for land reclamation. All expenses are allowed to be withdrawn from 30% of the fair price. It has been two years since the bureaus were established. The income has been decreasing day by day, but the disputes have been increasing day by day. The reason is that each bureau has no fixed expenses. The cunning people arbitrarily commit wrongdoings and repeatedly issue licenses, while the foolish people follow the old rules and procrastinate. Not only is there a way to take advantage of the clearing, but also the more management the more chaotic it becomes. Other factors such as changes in river flow, sand changes, and social and economic decline may also affect income. The director of the Finance Department takes into account the overall situation and originally planned to allocate funds to all bureaus.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Industrial and Commercial Credit Loans: Applicants Should Pay Attention to the Instructions; Applications Will Be Submitted to the Committee for Decision <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee has received about 20 applications since it started processing credit small loans a week ago. It is now conducting investigations and audits and will hold a committee meeting this week to make a decision on lending. However, although the committee entrusted the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to issue instructions with the application forms, most applicants did not pay attention to them, resulting in unclear procedures and frequent errors. Many companies have repeatedly inquired the committee by telephone. Although the committee staff answered them one by one, it is difficult to answer in detail over the phone, and errors are still inevitable. In order for the majority of loan applicants to understand the procedures, the instructions for the loan application are repeated below: Instructions for small credit loans from the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee: (1) The total amount is 5 million yuan. (2) Requests for credit loans are limited to factories manufacturing domestic products, stores selling domestic products, and transporters exporting domestic products. (3) In order to enable industrial and commercial enterprises to enjoy benefits equally, the maximum loan amount is limited to 5,000 yuan. (4) The credit loan is (A) for the purpose of maintaining production only and cannot be used to repay old debts, (B) not for speculative business or other improper purposes. Otherwise, once discovered, the committee will report to the government and punish the crime according to the law of embezzlement of public funds, (C) the goods and objects purchased with the loan shall not be mortgaged elsewhere, (D) the borrower shall report the expenses to the committee for reference on a monthly basis. (5) The application form and various forms for the credit loan shall be sent by the committee to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and distributed to the trade associations for the applicants of each industry to fill in and send back to facilitate the process. However, there are too many bureaus, and I am afraid that it will affect the budget. Now, the official properties of each county have been merged into the county. The trend of Shatun is to change the organization. Therefore, it is planned to abolish all the original bureaus and establish three Shatun bureaus to determine the funding and actively clean up. There is no doubt whether it should be liquidated. I will submit a plan, organization charter, and budget and other items, and submit a document for approval. (6) The application form and various forms can be obtained from the committee for investigation and audit on the second floor of the Guohuo Bank on Henan Road and Tianjin Road. Factories and shops that are not members of the trade association can also obtain the above forms from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and send them to the committee for review. (7) If the applicant's own company is already a guarantor of the credit loan, the loan standard amount shall be calculated by combining the amount of the guarantee (for example, if the applicant's qualification can be loaned 10,000 yuan, but there is a guarantee responsibility of 3,000 yuan, then it can only be loaned 7,000 yuan). (8) The committee handles loan investigation matters, and the cost is huge. According to bank regulations, the applicant should be responsible for the investigation fee of 2 yuan to subsidize the cost. The fee will be paid to the committee when the application form is returned, and a receipt will be issued. If the review is unqualified, it will be returned with the receipt. (9) The applicant should pay attention to the various regulations in the loan rules promulgated by the Ministry. (10) The committee may reject any application that does not meet the application procedures and does not comply with the loan regulations. (11) The application form and various forms of the committee are as follows: (1) Application form, (2) Application report, (3) Balance sheet, (4) Profit and loss statement. Regarding the above forms, if the applicant has not filled them out, he can ask those who have experience in new bookkeeping (such as accountants or banking accountants) to fill them out on his behalf.</p>
<p>The case is scheduled to be officially implemented on September 1 of this year. Each bureau should be abolished immediately, and the provincial department should set up a new bureau to handle it in accordance with the newly revised organizational charter. In addition to the detailed abolishment procedures, the Finance Department will issue another order to comply with the order and send it to the outside world. It is also ordered that the director of the bureau comply with the order and quickly sort out and end all documents, drawings, books, registers, etc., prepare a clear list, and prepare to transfer them. The procedures should be completed before August 31. From September 1, the new bureau will start receiving, and no arbitrary delays are allowed. This is very important, remember this order.</p>
<p>Three Additional Bureaus: Implemented on September 1</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Finance Department has already ordered the abolition of the original twelve bureaus and must not allow any delay in the Qing Zhang and reorganization of state-owned Shatun property. The provincial government and the Finance Department decided to set up three new Shatun bureaus in appropriate locations, determine funding, and seriously work. This method will be officially implemented on September 1, and a director will be appointed to be responsible for handling the matter. The candidate for director has not yet been decided. It is said that the original Chongqi Bureau, Nanchuan Feng Bureau, Songjinqing Bureau, and Shangbao Bureau will be merged into one bureau, and the address will be located in Shanghai. The remaining Tongruqing Bureau and each county bureau around Zhenjiang Jiangbei will be merged into two bureaus. The location has not yet been determined. According to a Shiye News Agency reporter's visit to the Shangbao Shatun Property Bureau yesterday, the director of the bureau, Li Shanyi, is still actively handling the measurement of official properties in the Changxingsha area of Baoshan County, and the work has not been stopped. Regarding the section on the ending of the provincial government's order, he has complied with the order to rush to handle it, and it is expected to be completed by the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Sino-Russian International Relations, Mr. Chen You Talks with Foreign Press Representatives <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that when the Pacific political turmoil was stirred up by Japan's occupation of Manchuria, Dr. Yan Huiqing, a prominent Chinese diplomat, once said that China had three options: Geneva, Soviet Russia, and Japan. The results of the League of Nations conference greatly disappointed the Chinese people. Later, China and Russia restored diplomatic relations, and Dr. Yan was appointed as the ambassador to Moscow, which has been two years now. On the 6th, Mr. Percy (transliteration), son of Chen Youren, when meeting with representatives of the North China Daily News, talked about the current state of Sino-Russian relations. This is the first exploration of the situation since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations. Mr. Chen believes that this kind of goodwill is still superficial and ordinary. Neither side has obtained special benefits to solidify and sustain it. Take the past fifteen years of Turkish-Russian goodwill as an example. The two countries are connected by a common interest in land, which is the issue of the Dardanelles Strait. Take French-Russian goodwill as an example. Both countries needed to end the European war as soon as possible. It is on this point that they share a common interest. However, there is still no basis for this between China and Russia. In the past eight years, I (Mr. Chen referring to himself) have studied the relationship between China and Russia. What pleases me is that this matter is now in the hands of Mr. Buyanoff (transliteration), the Russian ambassador to China, who can be described with one word: full. The Republic of China's foreign relations, especially with Russia, have experienced extreme harmony (1924-1927) and then armed conflict (1928-1930). The changes have been so drastic due to a lack of mutual understanding. In the past eight years, I have tried my best to bridge the emotions of the intellectual circles of both sides. We can only establish complete goodwill based on the realization of mutual interests. Today, we are still far from this. This interest is certainly ordinary, not special. In international affairs, true goodwill between two countries must be realized only when their special interests have a common point on land in economic interests or political policies. Now, even those who hope that Soviet Russia will cooperate with Japan and other countries on the Pacific Rim are not prepared to point out what special interests these countries have in common. As far as Russia and Japan are concerned, their interests seem to be directly opposed, not to mention common. As for the contact point between Soviet Russia and the United States, it can be summed up with a word from Mr. Bullitt, the American ambassador to Russia, which is "on the Arctic air route that is being crossed." In other words, the interests of the two countries may be the same in the future, but it cannot be said for sure at present. As for the attitude of Soviet Russia towards China, neither the Chinese nor the Russians have shown any inclination towards the contact points that may be sought. I have been observing Soviet Russia and the Russians for more than eight years and know that Soviet Russia is indeed a molecule with potential for seeking peace in the Pacific. The majority of the Russian people are more concerned with building a socialist motherland and raising their own living standards than with carrying out propaganda in other parts of the world. Propaganda, like church missionary work, is a thankless job and certainly has many dangers. According to Mr. Chen, who arrived in Shanghai from Russia three months ago, he has traveled to many cities in North China, as far as Suiyuan. Mr. Chen intends to familiarize himself with other aspects of international relations and China's internal politics and conditions within the next year. For this reason, when he goes to Europe to serve as a special correspondent for the Otsu Mainichi Shimbun, he will first go to Geneva to observe the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly, and then go to major cities to investigate the politics and policies of various countries. Mr. Chen studied in England and also studied at the University of London. He obtained his law degree a week before his adulthood, so he was valued by his teachers and friends. Before returning to China, he worked in the United States and the West Indies. After returning to China, he worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, he was ordered to go to Moscow, which has been eight years now. Mr. Chen is scheduled to take his wife to Europe via Siberia this Saturday, stay for about half a year, and then return to China via the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Explains that Notifications Do Not Need to Affix Stamps Next Month, One Cent Stamp Still Required This Month <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Knitwear Industry Association requesting an explanation regarding notifications. If no stamps are affixed, will it hinder the regulations? The association's reply is recorded below: Sir, we received your letter of the 6th stating that the notification is used to express the right to claim during the three festivals or at the end of the month. If no stamps are affixed, will it hinder the regulations? Please explain. After investigation, this notification, which has the effect of urging payment, is also called a reminder slip. The ministry has always stipulated that for amounts of one yuan or more, a one-cent stamp must be affixed. However, the Stamp Tax Law, which the National Government has scheduled to implement on September 1st, stipulates in Article 3, Paragraph 9 that account statements used to urge payment of debts or verify numbers are exempt from stamp duty. Therefore, the notification referred to by your association can be exempt from stamps starting from September 1st, but currently, it must still be stamped.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Party Departments on Both Railways Raise Relief Funds <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Special Party Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways in this port believe that the floods in various provinces are extremely severe, the disaster area covers millions of square miles, and the disaster victims number over 30 million.

The detailed methods are recorded below: (1) This method aims to provide relief to the floods in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basin provinces in 1935. (2) Relief funds are raised by the special party department organizing a donation team to be responsible for the management of various districts.

<h3 id="e100">Red Cross Seeks Relief Supplies <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The General Red Cross Society of China is currently in the period of soliciting members, working late into the night and making every effort to achieve the ultimate goal. Although the market is sluggish, the number of people joining the society is still enthusiastic, which shows that the Chinese people have a considerable understanding of the Red Cross Society. In the future, the plan to create rescue talents and reserve rescue materials will not be difficult to realize. However, as the floods in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins are in urgent need, telegrams requesting relief are pouring in. The disaster is severe and unbearable to read. It is planned to rush to the disaster area to provide relief day and night. However, due to the society's financial exhaustion, it is unable to allocate huge funds immediately. After repeated consultations, it has been decided to do its best to provide assistance. Therefore, starting from today, it is soliciting medicines, clothing, and donations. No matter how much, they are all welcome. People at home and abroad, if they have this righteous act, please send them to the society at No. 856, Xinzha Road. The telephone numbers are 34366 to 7.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Sino-Foreign Charitable Relief Society Continues to Receive Recent Reports from Various Disaster Areas <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Since receiving the bad news of the Yellow River and Yangtze River, the Sino-Foreign Charitable Relief Society on Renji Road has shocked Chinese and foreigners alike and is making every effort to raise relief funds. The telegrams and letters received from various disaster areas have been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. Now, the latest reports have been received and are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shandong. A letter from Wang Yide and other representatives of the disaster victims in Chengxian County stated that the amount of water in Chengxian this year is the largest in recent decades. When the official embankment breached this time, the waves rolled and poured straight into the abyss, heading east. In counties such as Dan, He, Ju, and Jia, where the flood arrived, only a vast expanse of water could be seen, with no villages to be found. The flooded area in the county, from the official embankment in the north to Shuncheng in the south, from Linpu in the west to Wuan in the east, is about 8,000 hectares. There are about 800 villages, and about -10,000 houses have collapsed. There are over 200,000 disaster victims, and over 2,000 people have drowned. The disaster victims who have not died are displaced everywhere. The washed-away grain and livestock are countless. The starving victims are awaiting food. In the midst of the scorching heat, the starving people who have been flooded will suffer from the plague again. Such suffering is even more unspeakable. I still appeal to you to quickly provide relief. Anhui. A telegram from Chen Dao and other representatives of the disaster victims in Guanzhuang, Tonglu County, stated, "Our village borders the Yangtze River and stretches for more than 60 miles, with 40,000 mu of fertile land and 60,000 residents. Since the disaster in Minguo, the vitality has been destroyed and has not yet recovered. Unexpectedly, the catastrophe has struck again. The northern embankment of the Yangtze River was reported to have collapsed on July 18. The fields, houses, and livestock were submerged, countless. The total loss in the village is about 2 million yuan. The disaster victims who failed to evacuate were buried in the bellies of fish. Those who were spared were also suffering from sleeping in the open and eating in the wind. Nine out of ten houses are empty, and there is no food to beg for. Moreover, after the drought, the autumn is approaching, and epidemics are prevalent. Hunger and cold are intertwined. It is expected that tens of thousands of disaster victims will fill the ditches sooner or later. Please allocate emergency relief to save the dying disaster victims." Anhui. A telegram from the Flood Relief and Work Relief Committee of Guangchengwei, Huaining County, stated, "Guangchengwei has been frequently flooded and drought-stricken, and the people's strength has been declining. The sores have not been healed, and another catastrophe has struck. The reason for the collapse is that there are no dams along the Yangtze River in the upstream Laohuchang area. The Yangtze River tides poured into the area, and the water suddenly rose several feet, resulting in deep suffering. As a result, tens of thousands of mu of planted land became the home of fish, and several thousand homes were turned into sacrifices. Displacement and migration are miserable and indescribable. The faces of the vegetable-eating victims are even more pitiful. It is now planned to repair the embankment and work instead of relief to save the disaster victims."</p>

<p>Seventy-four expelled overseas Chinese, including Hu Junmin, who were in Japan, faced financial difficulties and requested relief from the municipal government and reported their expulsion to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau. The authorities expressed deep sympathy for their plight. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau assigned personnel to distribute temporary relief funds of three yuan per person and a discounted round-trip steamer ticket from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In addition, Mayor Wu generously donated 100 yuan in national currency for relief. Refugee representatives, including Hu Junmin, went to collect the funds yesterday morning and distributed them to the other refugees. According to Hu Junmin, who spoke to a reporter from the Industrial News Agency yesterday, they were deeply grateful for the assistance from the authorities, which prevented them from being stranded in Shanghai. They were also grateful for the generosity of the Jiangxi Guild Hall in providing accommodation, setting a good example for the world. To express their gratitude, they presented a large mirror frame as a memento. It is reported that the Wenzhou refugees boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai'an steamer last night to return home, while others went to various places to seek a livelihood. However, a few refugee representatives are temporarily staying in Shanghai and plan to go to Beijing within days to report to various government agencies.</p>

Yesterday, the chairmen of the Cotton Cloth Exchange, Mu Ouchu; the Gold Exchange, Du Yuesheng; the Securities Exchange, Zhang Weiru; the Flour Exchange, Wang Yiting; and the Grain Exchange, Gu Xinyi, jointly petitioned the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting prompt approval to issue a general order to ban these organizations. The petition stated: "Regarding the petition to ban illegal commercial organizations similar to exchange trading and to protect legitimate business, it has been found that in recent times, a small number of unscrupulous individuals have taken advantage of extraterritoriality to establish illegal commercial organizations similar to exchange trading, openly buying and selling and profiting as intermediaries. The harm caused by this is unimaginable. These illegal organizations cater to the speculative psychology of those struggling financially, using small units to lure non-official merchants to entrust them with buying and selling. As a result, anyone with five, ten, or even two or three yuan can engage in buying and selling, ultimately being exploited by commissions and suffering disastrous losses due to market fluctuations. These illegal organizations have no fixed capital and are not subject to the regulations of the Exchange Law. If they encounter unfavorable circumstances, the clients who are involved have no legal protection. Countless people have been harmed by this and have no way to help themselves. At the same time, the business of legitimate exchanges is damaged, and the market is disrupted. Furthermore, in recent years, more and more Chinese people have engaged in trading in securities and goods on the American stock exchange, all handled by these illegal organizations. The capital lost and flowing out each year amounts to millions of yuan. This is not only alarming because of the huge outflow of cash, but also greatly reduces the liquidity of domestic securities and goods, leading to stagnation in the social economy. Article 16 of the Exchange Law clearly stipulates that no one may engage in the business of acting as an agent, introducing, or transmitting exchange transactions. If these illegal commercial organizations are allowed to exist, what is the point of national legislation? They should be strictly banned according to law, both to maintain the authority of our government and to protect the business of legitimate exchanges. This is in the public interest."</p>

<h3 id="e105">On the Ning Shao Steamer, a Young Man Leapt into the Sea: He Jumped into the Sea in the Outer Tongsha Waters, Leaving Behind a Letter, a Badge, and a Western Suit; His Name Was Zhu Qiming, Only Twenty-One Years Old <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Ning Shao Steamer Company's New Ning Shao steamer set sail from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5:00 pm on the 5th. A young passenger jumped into the sea when the ship passed the Tongsha waters. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Jumped into the Sea: The New Ning Shao steamer set sail from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5:00 pm on the 5th. At 8:00 pm that night, when the ship passed the Tongsha waters, a young passenger suddenly jumped into the sea from the upper bunk of a third-class cabin. The ship's purser, Li Ruiting, heard the alarm and ordered the ship to stop and search, but the currents were too strong, and he had already disappeared.</p>
<p>Letter Found: It was later discovered that the passenger was staying in the upper bunk of a third-class cabin. The cabin attendant, Zhong Rongtang, found a letter, a woolen suit, a badge, a small amount of foreign coins, and several picture books on his bunk. Nothing else was found and all were handed over to the purser's office.</p>
<p>Seemed Like an Athlete: The letter was addressed to his parents and written in pencil on作文 paper. It was sealed in blank foreign paper, but no address was written. The handwriting was elegant, and the wording was clear and fluent. The badge was about the size of a 20-cent silver coin, with the words "Cheng Yize Presented in 1932" engraved on one side and the words "China" engraved on the other. A flying eagle was engraved on the top, and a running figure was engraved on the bottom. Based on these items, the deceased was likely an athlete.</p>
<p>Contents of the Letter: Reading the letter, it was learned that the deceased's name was Zhu Qiming, and he was only twenty-one years old. He was a promising young man, so why did he do this? The cause of his death is truly speculative. The original text of his letter is as follows: "Dear Parents, I have a stubborn personality and have lived for twenty-one years. I will never forget the care and nurturing you have given me. However, on this autumn night, I must bid you farewell forever. Alas, this gray universe hides emptiness and indifference. When the fierce winds and rainstorms attack my weak will, I have tasted enough pain from repeated encounters. Fate is mocking me, and I feel that life is dull. I will eventually follow the aimless pursuit, filled with the terror of existence. Let me stop breathing as soon as possible, and I will be content. Alas, the end of my life will be tonight under the autumn moon. Farewell, my flesh and blood parents, and everything in the world. Your unfilial son, Zhu Qiming, written August 5th."</p>
<p>Final Words: At the end of the letter were the following words, with a sad and poignant tone, thought to be his last words before death: "All grievances will be repaid in the next life. Do not grieve for my unfilial death." The ship returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the items were handed over to the Jiangxi Road General Bureau by the ship's purser, Li Ruiting, for the family to claim.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Finance recently sent tax collectors and inspectors to the Wu Song district to investigate the rent of various shops and increase the assessed rent to increase property tax revenue. For example, the monthly rent of Wan Sheng Sauce Garden was originally 70 yuan, but it is now assessed at 120 yuan. The rent of Shun Tai Yuan Silk Shop was originally 40 yuan, but it is now assessed at 65 yuan. Other shops, such as Hu Xiang Xing and Xu Hong Sheng, have also had their rents increased by one-half or one-third. After hearing the news, the shops expressed their opposition, saying that Wu Song had only recently recovered from the war and that now was a time of economic downturn and hardship for the people. They could not afford to have their rent increased. They sent letters to the Wu Song Chamber of Commerce, urging them to forward their concerns to the Bureau of Finance and maintain the old assessed rent to ease the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Manager of Tong Qing Money Exchange and Others Accused of Embezzlement; Case Resolved; Police Agree to Withdraw Charges; Xia Guichu Posts Reliable Shop Guarantee <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Xia Guichu, a Ningbo native and manager of the Tong Qing Money Exchange at 180 Ningbo Road, and Zhu Haichu, a Huzhou native and assistant manager, were recently accused by shareholders Xu Maotang and others, through lawyer E Sen, to the General Police Station of colluding in embezzlement and misappropriating public funds amounting to 524,393.23 yuan. Chinese detective Chen Yaoting and Western detective Warren G. S. arrested Xia and Zhu and charged them with embezzlement in the First Special District Court. After one hearing, the court ordered a postponement. Xia Guichu was returned to custody, and Zhu Haichu was allowed to post 100,000 yuan in cash or a shop guarantee. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court opened the criminal court for a continued hearing. The plaintiffs first presented sufficient evidence, but because the plaintiffs and defendants had now reached a settlement, the evidence was not presented, making it impossible for the police to conduct an investigation. According to the plaintiffs, they wanted the police to withdraw the public prosecution in the case. The Western detective in charge consulted the district chief, who stated that according to Article 248 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution could be withdrawn before the conclusion of the first instance debate. Therefore, he agreed to the plaintiff's request, but the article stipulated that the withdrawal must be in writing. Therefore, he requested the court to postpone the case for a week so that a written request could be submitted within that time to withdraw the charges. Xia Guichu's lawyers, Fan Gang and Zhao Fuding, argued that since the police had requested a withdrawal, Xia should be allowed to post a guarantee to appear when summoned. Zhu Haichu's lawyer, Wu Linkun, said that according to police precedent, withdrawals were not made in writing. Since the police lawyer had verbally stated that he was withdrawing the charges, the court should consider the charges withdrawn to avoid delaying the proceedings. Judge Feng stated that the new Criminal Law stipulated that withdrawals must be made in writing. Police prosecutions were usually made with a case report, so at a minimum, a case report requesting a withdrawal should be submitted. Therefore, he ordered the case to be postponed for one week, and Xia Guichu was allowed to post a reliable shop guarantee for release.</p>

<p>The newly built three-story Western-style house at 50, Lane 344, Beile Road, in the French Concession, is owned by Sun Cailing, a native of Ningbo. Sun is currently an employee of the China Farmers Bank in Hankou. He has a wife and four sons. Except for the eldest son, who suffers from mental illness, the other three sons are studying at a nearby school. On the afternoon of the 5th, Sun's youngest son, who is nine years old, was playing in the lane and suddenly disappeared. Sun's wife discovered this and ordered the male and female servants to search everywhere, but they could not be found. While Sun and others were anxious, the kidnappers sent someone to throw a letter through the glass window of the back door. The letter demanded a ransom of 500,000 yuan. Sun Cailing and others were shocked after reading the letter and realized that the boy had been kidnapped. They reported the information to the French police in charge of the area and requested that they send officers to investigate the kidnappers and rescue the boy. After receiving the report, the police chief dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Huang Xianyao's Forgery Case Continued; Huang's Lawyer Presented a Letter Proving Huang Was Deceived <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Huang Xianyao, the son of the late Huang Chujiu, founder of the Gong Fa Company's Day and Night Bank and the Great World, previously hired lawyer Mi Jingshen to file a case seeking to live with his wife, Zhou. Mi and his clerk, Wu Jiajin, forged a document stating that 100,000 yuan of property was deposited with his father-in-law, Zhou Songqing, and petitioned the Shanghai District Court for mediation, hoping to defraud his father-in-law of money. Later, because the mediation failed, Wang Shaozeng, a creditor of the Gong Fa Company, obtained the forged document and hired lawyer Xu Yannian to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court Criminal Division, accusing Zhou Songqing and his son-in-law Huang Xianyao of damaging creditors' rights. Because Huang failed to appear in court, the court arrested Huang. The court then opened a safety deposit box at the Guohua Bank and retrieved the forged document. Zhou Songqing reported the matter to the police, accusing Huang Xianyao, Mi Jingshen, Wu Jiajin, and others of forging documents. After police investigation and identification, the document was confirmed to be a forgery and not written by Zhou. Because the two defendants, Mi and Wu, had already left Shanghai, Huang Xianyao was handed over to the Second Special District Court, and the police department lawyer filed a public prosecution under Article 210 of the Criminal Law for forgery. Judge Li Changnian questioned Huang and ordered him to be detained pending a further hearing with the other defendants. This was reported in detail in the 30th of last month. At 11:00 am yesterday, Judge Li of the Second Special District Court continued the hearing in the First Criminal Division. Fei Xizhen represented the police department in court. The detective in charge of the case, Lu Zhixiang, reported that the two defendants, Mi Jingshen and Wu Jiajin, had fled and could not be summoned to court. The plaintiff, Zhou Songqing, 73 years old, testified that Huang Xianyao was his son-in-law. After he requested mediation in the District Court in September of the 22nd year, he was originally going to sue him, but his mother spoke for him, saying that he was mentally ill, and his daughter pleaded with him, so he dropped the matter. He did not know about the document until he was accused and Judge Shu showed him a photo of the document. He then learned that it was forged and that there was no such thing. Wang Shaozeng filed the accusation on December 28th of last year. The defendant Huang Xianyao, 31 years old, from Yuyao, testified that he worked in a Chinese and Western pharmacy. An officer gave Huang a pencil draft to look at and asked, "Did you write this paper?" Huang replied, "Yes, this is the draft. According to your statement, this document was not written by your father-in-law, is that right?" Huang replied, "Yes, it was made by Wu Jiajin at Mi Jingshen's place. I originally hired a lawyer to handle the cohabitation case, and he did this. I didn't see who wrote this document, and I didn't receive this document. It was given to Mi by Wu. Tang Shouchun was present at the time. Tang tried to extort money but failed and gave the photograph to the creditor. I didn't go to the mediation court at first. Later, Tang told me to say that this document was found in my wife's clothing box." At this point, Huang's defense lawyer presented a letter from Wu Jiajin to Huang and a photograph of Wu, stating that the letter was found by Huang's family at home, which proved that Huang had been deceived. Huang said that he received the letter two or three months after the previous mediation because he did not trust Wu. He sent the letter as a guarantee. The court examined the letter and filed the photograph, returning the letter to the defendant's defense lawyer. The court then stated that the facts of the case still needed to be studied in detail, and the files of the previous case needed to be reviewed for reference. The hearing was postponed to the 16th, and the defendant was returned to custody. The court also told the plaintiff, Zhou Songqing, to submit any evidence in the case as soon as possible. If there were witnesses, they should be brought to court for questioning next time. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Superstitious Belief in Divine Power; A Girl's Life Wrongfully Lost; Ji Gong's Ineffectiveness, Incense Ashes Useless; Shen Shoutang and Others Sued in Court <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shoutang, a carpenter from Zhejiang, and Xiang Xueshu, from Jiading, usually believed in Buddhism, so they gathered ten comrades to rent a house at 81 Hanbilili Road, Hongkou, to set up Ji Gong Hall, specializing in using divine blessings to cure children's illnesses. On the morning of the 14th of last month, Wang Ming, a native of Yangzhou living at 18 Ruikangli, Jiaxing Road, because his seven-year-old granddaughter, A-San, suddenly fell ill, heard that Ji Gong Hall had a divine spirit to cure diseases, so Wang Ming's daughter-in-law, Wang Jiangshi, took A-San to seek treatment. Shen and others charged ten yuan. After paying a deposit of one yuan, Shen and others gave them a talisman, totaling twelve, and several packets of incense ashes, instructing them to mix them with boiling water and drink them at home. On the 18th, they went for another consultation and paid another half yuan. Shen and others still used the previous method, instructing them to ingest the ashes. Unexpectedly, after taking them, A-San's condition worsened the next day and she soon died. Wang believed that his granddaughter's death was caused by Shen and others, so he hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file a lawsuit against Shen and Xiang in the First Special District Court for the crime of using sorcery to confuse people and causing death through negligence. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division. The two defendants also surrendered with their defense lawyers. The plaintiff, Wang Ming, and his daughter-in-law, Wang Jiangshi, also surrendered, stating that when they went to seek treatment, Xiang Xueshu acted as Ji Gong, treating the illness at a table, and Shen gave them talismans and incense ashes, and A-San's condition worsened after taking them, and she died on the 19th. They had paid 1.5 yuan and requested an investigation. The two defendants stated that the plaintiff came on their own accord to seek a divination from the Ji Gong spirit, so they gave them talismans and incense ashes, telling them to swallow them with boiling water, and denied receiving any money. After the lawyers for both sides debated, Judge Liu declared the debate closed and ordered the two defendants to each provide a shop guarantee for appearance when summoned, pending sentencing on the morning of the 9th.</p>

<p>On the night before last and yesterday, three men jumped into the Huangpu River, all due to economic pressure. Fortunately, they were rescued separately and sent to charitable organizations for relief. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Xikang, 33 years old, from Huai'an, was struggling financially. At around 6:00 pm the night before last, he hired a sampan numbered 315 at the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong, saying that he wanted to cross to the Muddy Bank in South Shanghai and agreed to pay 20 cents for the fare. However, when the boat reached the waters near Cheqi Port, Wu suddenly paid one yuan and then jumped off to commit suicide. He was rescued by the boatman and sent to the Customs Water Police Station, and then to a charitable organization for relief.</p>
<p>Zhong Weixin, 30 years old, from Ningbo, had been unemployed for a long time and had no home to return to, so he became despondent. At 10:00 am yesterday, he jumped into the Huangpu River from the Baidu Bridge outside the Suzhou Creek. He was rescued by the police and taken to the Customs Water Police Station, and then to the Ningbo Association for relief.</p>
<p>Shen Yongjin, 28 years old, from Ningbo, had borrowed money to purchase soda to sell, but he was struggling financially due to the small profit. At 8:15 am yesterday, he boarded a Taikoo Company express ferry at the Yangjingbang Wharf. When the ship reached the middle of the river, Shen jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. He was rescued by the boatman and sent to the Customs Water Police Station, and then to the Ningbo Association for relief.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Wu Xikang Fell and Drowned <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xikang, 33 years old, from Huaicheng, who lived at 40 Changleli, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, usually made a living by collecting leftover food (commonly known as "leftovers") from various restaurants. At around 8:00 pm the night before last, he was cooling off on the Hengfeng Road Bridge when he fell into the river. By the time he was pulled out, he was already dead. Yesterday morning, the local police station ordered the local security chief, Li Ruiru, to report the case to the court for inspection. Later, the deceased's father, Wu Shenzheng, petitioned the court to waive the inspection, stating, "The deceased had four sons. The eldest son, Xikang, carelessly fell into the river and drowned. It was no one's fault. I request a waiver of the inspection and am willing to arrange for the coffin and burial," and so on. After being questioned by prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, the request was granted, and he was instructed to arrange for the coffin and burial as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Reasons Why Telephone Prices Should Not Be Increased in the Extraterritorial Road Area: Telephone Rates in the Extraterritorial Area Are Already High; Furthermore, the Telephones Used Have Not Been Converted to Automatic <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's telephone price increase is due to the construction of extraterritorial roads in both Huxi and Hubei. Because the sovereignty belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau has sent a letter to the company, stating that if the company wants to increase the price of telephones installed in the area, it must first obtain permission from the Municipal Government. Otherwise, telephone users in the area will not be charged the increased price. The details have been reported in various newspapers. Yesterday, a reporter inquired with someone familiar with the matter. According to them, the sovereignty of the extraterritorial road area belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the telephone price increase should first be approved by the Municipal Government. Furthermore, the Shanghai Telephone Company's price list stipulates that telephone prices outside the concession must be agreed upon with the administrative head other than the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession before they can take effect. Moreover, telephone prices in the extraterritorial road area are one or two yuan higher per phone than in the two concessions. Telephone charges in the extraterritorial road area in Hubei are particularly high and should not be increased again. In addition, the contract between the company and the two concession authorities stipulates that prices can only be increased after all telephones have been converted to automatic. Currently, telephones in the extraterritorial road area in Huxi have not been converted to automatic, but prices are being increased at the same time as in the concession, which is inappropriate. Therefore, the Public Utility Bureau's prevention of the telephone company's price increase in the extraterritorial road area is not only a matter of sovereignty but also for the benefit of telephone users and is therefore supported by the citizens.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Oil Piandee is Involved in a Lawsuit with the Continental Bank: The First Special Court Continued the Hearing Yesterday Morning. The Guanghua Company Entrusted a Lawyer to Participate in the Litigation. The Continental Bank Requested the Court to Reject the Lawsuit Based on Legal Principles. <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The case between the Soviet Russian Oil Piandee Oil Trust Company and the Guanghua Oil Company, with the Continental Bank as the guarantor of the debt, was heard for the second instance in the First Special District Court at 9:30 AM yesterday. Judge Li Hu presided over the hearing. The plaintiff was still represented by foreign attorney Wei Lv, and the defendant, the Continental Bank, was represented by attorney Xu Shihao. The Guanghua Company was represented by attorney Wang Xiaowen. Both parties made their arguments, which lasted for two and a half hours. The plaintiff first made a supplementary statement of reasons for filing the lawsuit. Then, defendant Xu Shihao stood up and made his defense. The two most important points were that the Continental Bank was the guarantor of Guanghua's debt, and that it seemed inappropriate for Oil Piandee to directly sue the Continental Bank without first dealing with Guanghua. Secondly, regarding Guanghua's debt to Oil Piandee, the defendant had forwarded the plaintiff's letter to Guanghua, and the reply stated that they absolutely could not pay on their behalf. Therefore, although the defendant wanted to pay Oil Piandee, it was impossible, because if the payment was not recognized by Guanghua in the future, who would the defendant seek debt from? Finally, Wang Xiaowen, the attorney representing Guanghua, also stood up and requested that the lawsuit be suspended, because there were still other procedural entanglements between Guanghua and Oil Piandee that needed to be resolved legally. In the end, the court adjourned and the plaintiff, defendant, and participant left the courtroom to await the court's decision on a scheduled date. The Continental Bank's statement of defense is recorded as follows: "Statement of defense regarding the case of the Oil Piandee Company suing for guaranteed debt. Regarding the contract signed by the plaintiff and Guanghua Oil Company on November 1st last year for the sale of kerosene, the Guanghua Company and the plaintiff first requested the defendant to sign a guarantee. At that time, the defendant and its agent, attorney Xu Shihao, considered that the content of the guarantee established by the plaintiff was inappropriate and the scope was too broad. Moreover, regarding the amount, the original guarantee stated US$400,000, but the defendant only acknowledged guaranteeing half of that amount. Furthermore, Chapter 6 of the guarantee stated, 'Our bank allows for the immediate payment to your company of any of the aforementioned funds when Guanghua Oil Company fails to fulfill the obligations of the aforementioned contracts, or any of the aforementioned contracts, and our bank has no conditions,' which clearly placed the guarantor in the same position as the principal debtor, Guanghua Company. This greatly deviated from the principles of guaranteed debt, and completely eliminated the guarantor's rights of prior recourse and search for assets, which was greatly different from the defendant's original intention to act as a guarantor. After repeated negotiations, and stating that it would not sign the agreement without changes to the guarantee, the plaintiff agreed to change the scope and responsibility of the guarantee, and stated that the guarantee and contract documents had been sent to the Moscow headquarters. However, for the sake of convenience, both parties could exchange letters to clarify the basis for the amendment. The defendant and the plaintiff then exchanged letters simultaneously, and Article 6 stated, 'If Guanghua fails to fulfill part or all of the obligations in the aforementioned guarantee, your company should first give our bank two weeks' written notice, and at the same time, before requesting payment from our bank, should first make every effort to have Guanghua pay the funds. Your company should also present all evidence on which the request for payment from Guanghua is based when requesting payment from our bank,' etc. Therefore, according to the content of the exchanged letters, even if the plaintiff believed that Guanghua Company had failed to fulfill any of the terms of the original contract, it could only file a lawsuit against Guanghua Company based on Article 6 of the exchanged letters and fully assert its claims. (The phrase in the exchanged letters, 'make every effort to have Guanghua pay the funds,' includes the procedure of filing a lawsuit, which is very clear.) Given that the defendant was originally in the position of guarantor, its inherent rights of prior recourse and search for assets were not waived at all. How could the plaintiff directly file a lawsuit against the defendant alone, thereby violating the litigation procedures? Furthermore, Guanghua Company has already filed a statement to participate in the lawsuit, and based on Article 14 of the original contract, if there is an event of force majeure, the contract should be temporarily suspended, and neither party shall bear any losses. In terms of the facts, since December of last year, the domestic market situation has been unprecedentedly depressed for decades, and the kerosene business has also been affected, as has been the case for all companies, not just Guanghua. This serious change was an unforeseen fact and an uncontrollable phenomenon. According to the provisions of Article 14 on force majeure in the contract, Guanghua Company has absolutely no liability for compensation. Therefore, the defendant, based on the relationship of guaranteed debt, has no further responsibility. Even if we take a step back and disregard Article 14 of the contract, and assume that the principal debtor, Guanghua Company, cannot be exempted from liability, it is essential that the plaintiff first sue Guanghua Company to pursue execution from the standpoint of the defendant's right to search for assets. If its property is insufficient for repayment, then it can make a claim against the defendant. Before suing Guanghua Company, the plaintiff has absolutely no reason to file a lawsuit against the defendant alone and ignore Guanghua, both legally and factually. Therefore, this statement of defense is filed, and it is humbly requested that your court review it promptly and issue a judgment rejecting the plaintiff's lawsuit and ordering it to bear the litigation costs. This would be greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter to the Arts and Crafts Bureau, Requesting that It Not Impose Excessive Fines on Bicycles. Convey to the Police Department Not to Impose Further Fines on Bicycles Traveling Without Violating Regulations <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Concession Engineering Bureau yesterday, stating, "Regarding the letter from the Bicycle Repair Industry Association of the city on the 6th of this month, reporting that various bicycle shops in the central district have been reporting that in recent months, the British police have been driving prison vans from 9 PM every night, regardless of the circumstances, detaining large numbers of bicycles along the road, sending them to the police station, and sentencing them to fines before returning the vehicles. As a result, passengers dare not inquire, and businesses are on the verge of collapse. The members of the association have opened bicycle shops, donated registration certificates in accordance with regulations, and paid various taxes, so why should they be harassed and hinder commerce for no reason? Moreover, at a time when all industries are declining, the bicycle shop industry relies on the income of the summer and autumn seasons to make up for the losses in the remaining winter. Now, they are being suppressed by the police. If this continues until winter, they will inevitably be unable to maintain their livelihoods. Thinking of this, they cannot help but feel chilled to the bone. We should request your association to seriously negotiate to maintain the members' last hope of survival.</p>
<p>Based on this, the association found that the British police were obstructing vehicles, and after receiving reports from the same industry, the reason for the detention was unknown. If this continues, our fellow traders will inevitably suffer a great impact. We are specifically reporting the true situation and requesting your association to promptly negotiate and correct the British police's abuse of detaining bicycles in order to provide relief and stabilize commerce. Based on this, the association found that bicycle shops established in the public concession area have donated registration certificates in accordance with regulations and paid various taxes. Therefore, there is no violation of regulations in renting out the vehicles, and excessive fines should absolutely not be imposed. According to the aforementioned situation, the industry is being pushed to the brink of collapse. We are hereby sending a letter, hoping that your bureau will operate and promptly convey to the police department that bicycles traveling within the concession that do not violate the regulations should no longer be detained in order to maintain business. We would be deeply grateful."</p>

We then received a reply from the association stating, 'We have sent a letter urging the bureau,' etc. Now, many more days have passed, and we still have not received your bureau's approval. We are submitting another petition, requesting prompt approval as requested in order to reassure the merchants. As for the difficult circumstances that require the maintenance of the original vehicle style, we have detailed them in the petition of July 24. We hope that your bureau will consider the difficult situation of the merchants and show compassion. The merchants would be very grateful. We submit this petition with trepidation."</p>

<p>National Physician Wang Yueting Repeatedly Cures Serious Illnesses National Physician Wang Yueting is the son of Mr. Wang Zhongqi and comes from a family with a long history of medicine. He has long been trusted by patients. Since the beginning of summer, there have been many seasonal illnesses, and those who have sought his treatment have been cured quickly. Since moving to Jinde Lane, south of Chengdu Road and Weihaiwei Road, last month, the clinic has been more accessible and business has been busier. However, those coming from afar to seek treatment often miss the consultation hours. The consultation hours are from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Latecomers will not be seen.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong had cloudy skies with rain, with winds from the northeast to east. The East China Sea and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River had cloudy skies with showers, which were likely to be even more severe, with strong southeasterly winds. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River had rain, with strong winds from the southeast to northeast. This was due to the hurricane near Xiamen turning northwest or northward. At 2:00 PM, the center of the hurricane had moved to within approximately 60 miles of 26 degrees north latitude and 115 degrees east longitude. The wind force was unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 92.3 degrees and the lowest was 77.0 degrees.

<h3 id="e141">Thoughts on Revitalizing the Cigarette Industry <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Bao, Wu Tingchen</p>
<p>I was born late. In the short span of several decades, material changes have been numerous. The last twenty years have been especially significant. Taking cigarettes as an example, I cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitude. Tobacco flowed into China no more than three hundred years ago. When I was young, I often saw farmers in the fields with an old bamboo root pipe in hand. They would drill a hole next to the root, fill it with tobacco, strike a flint, and a wisp of clear smoke would rise. They would use it to relax during breaks from work. As for the gentry, officials, and women in their chambers, the pipes they used were either made of copper or silver, with tassels hanging from the top and embroidered pouches attached to the bottom, making them even more luxurious. As a result, dry and water tobacco shops were set up everywhere in the city. This was the era when native tobacco was popular. Forty years ago, imported cigarettes flowed in continuously. Later, foreign merchants even established factories in China to manufacture them. At that time, smokers were merely driven by curiosity, holding a cigarette in their mouths simply to show off their fashion. Later, due to their convenience of carrying and simple smoking method, they became more and more popular. The outflow of money caused commentators to believe that it was no less than opium. Socially conscious people even established non-cigarette smoking associations, but the trend could not be stopped. This was the era when foreign cigarettes sold well. Chinese entrepreneurs saw that imported cigarettes were selling like hotcakes and that there must be great profits to be made. They then set up factories to imitate them. Nanyang started first, and Huacheng followed. After the May Thirtieth Movement, small and medium-sized factories sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The strength of Chinese cigarettes not only filled the domestic market but could also be exported abroad. Wherever the footsteps of overseas Chinese reached, national cigarettes followed. This was the golden age of national cigarettes. Seeing the rise of the Chinese cigarette industry, foreign merchants, fearing that it might hinder their business, relied on their strong capital and used their diplomatic skills. In an instant, the Chinese factories gradually showed signs of being unable to sustain themselves. In the past two years, they had also engaged in behind-the-scenes struggles, opening up new fronts and attempting to struggle, but ultimately it did not help to alleviate their decline, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Some say that China is a country founded on agriculture, but the raw materials for food and clothing are largely imported. According to the Bank of China's report for the twenty-third year of the Republic (1934), the import of agricultural products that year reached more than 334 million yuan. Among them, rice accounted for more than 65.6 million yuan, cotton accounted for more than 90 million yuan, and wheat accounted for more than 31.8 million yuan. Why do you alone loudly advocate for the cigarette industry, which is unrelated to people's livelihood? Is this not inappropriate? I say that the items listed above are the result of natural and man-made disasters. Once the countryside recovers, it is hoped that the imports may decrease. However, the decline of the cigarette industry is aimed at foreign merchants. Therefore, without conducting research on production and sales, it is impossible to hope for its revitalization. Nor can it be effective by the efforts of manufacturers alone. It must be through the joint assistance of the Chinese people that it can be remedied. It must be known that although cigarettes are a consumable item, there are many people who grow tobacco, many who make cigarettes, many who sell cigarettes, and many others who are indirectly engaged in the cigarette industry. One industry, however small, is related to such a large number of people. Chinese people who smoke cigarettes should, when they have one in their mouths, silently think about whether it was grown by Chinese people and made by Chinese people. If it is a national cigarette, they should then put it in their mouths. Then, the national cigarette manufacturers will directly benefit, and the tobacco farmers and tobacco workers can also maintain their livelihoods. As for the manufacturers themselves, they should work hard day and night to constantly improve. This goes without saying.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Confession of an Old Brand Smoker <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xinwen Bao, Yu Kongwo</p>
<p>I, this old brand smoker, was a person who didn't smoke cigarettes five years ago. Two or three cigarettes would dry my throat. But no one would have thought that now I smoke an average of seventy cigarettes a day. When talking to familiar friends about the number of cigarettes they smoke, I haven't encountered an opponent. No one has exceeded my record.</p>
<p>On average, each cigarette takes eight minutes to consume. In one hour, I can only smoke seven or eight cigarettes. Generally speaking, I spend eight or nine hours a day surrounded by misty smoke. To a high degree, I don't like to use a lighter. I pass the flame from one cigarette to the next. Friends can believe this. When they meet me, they always see me with a cigarette in my mouth. Cartoonists might think that this cigarette is more important than any part of my eyes, nose, or any other part of my face.</p>
<p>Here, I want to talk about how my cigarette consumption has increased so dramatically. Even I myself am puzzled. Perhaps the bitterness of life is the biggest reason people smoke. It's a pity I never understood elegant words such as stimulating thoughts and increasing inspiration.</p>
<p>There are probably more than just me who smoke because of the bitterness of life. Therefore, talking about quitting cigarettes is simply asking me to be suffocated to death. However, based on my experience as an "old brand smoker," I feel that many people "superstitiously" believe that imported cigarettes are better because of their expensive price. I am fundamentally opposed from head to toe. My reason is that cigarettes are a daily necessity, like rice. You can't compare the taste of eating them with the mindset of eating bird's nest or shark fin. In such an economic downturn, "rice" is impossible not to eat. If it were unnecessary luxuries like shark fin or bird's nest, you could simply not smoke them.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the standpoint of an "old brand smoker," I would like to advise my fellow smokers: If you don't need to smoke, it is best not to smoke. If you have to smoke them as a substitute for tea and food like I do, you should still smoke national cigarettes. Of course, advocating national goods is a national duty. At the same time, I feel that eating "rice" must be eating foreign "rice." You are simply a bit "foreign" or, you could say, "slavish"…</p>
<h3 id="e143">Promoting National Cigarettes <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Bao, He Xiya</p>
<p>Cigarettes can invigorate the mind and aid in writing, so those engaged in a life of writing often enjoy them. And I enjoy them even more. Since I enjoy them, I cannot help but have my own preferences. This is why I am happy to talk about the benefits of this thing today.</p>
<p>Smoking cigarettes can also avoid filth, resolve fishy smells, dispel worries, eliminate depression, enjoy guests, and aid in conversation. Its use is so broad that it is no less than a necessity. When traveling alone in a hotel and bored, whenever the wine is drunk, the songs are sung, after meals and tea, light a cigarette, savor the taste endlessly, and the fragrance fills the air, and the whole body is soothed. It is not only for scholars to monopolize, but also for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>From the perspective of our country's national economy today, the act of smoking cigarettes should not be promoted. However, precisely because it is an economic issue, national cigarettes have a bitter reason that makes it impossible not to promote them. One is to reduce the outflow of wealth, and the other is to maintain the livelihoods of tobacco farmers and cigarette workers. It is only out of necessity.</p>
<p>Today's China is an extremely serious transitional era. Because of this, general phenomena in society are all filled with contradictory postures. The promotion and prohibition of cigarette smoking are also one of its ends. However, we believe that if we can base this on the spirit of loving the country and promoting national goods, we should examine this opportunity. What should be preserved? What should be promoted? This is understood by everyone and does not require further discussion. As for cigarettes, we can come to a conclusion: It is better to boldly promote smoking national cigarettes than to smoke foreign cigarettes.</p>
<h3 id="e144">August 8th National Goods Cigarette Festival Declaration <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Our association announces its establishment, just twenty days ago. In order to expand publicity and make it lasting, we have designated August 8th as the National Goods Cigarette Festival and published this special edition to strengthen our support. We, the committee members, are tasked with a heavy responsibility. On this auspicious occasion, we cannot remain silent. We would like to say a few words to our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the sea borders, goods from the East and West have been flowing into China in increasing quantities. Cigarettes have also been sold in our country along with this commercial war. Later, foreign merchants set up cigarette factories in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, manufacturing and selling them in large quantities. The business rights for cigarette sales in our country were entirely controlled by them. By the late Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people began to pay attention to this. They raised funds to set up cigarette factories, but due to poor management and crude equipment, they all failed. However, they continued to try one after another, never losing heart. Since the May Thirtieth Movement, more and more Chinese have invested in cigarette factories. The business of Chinese factories has flourished, recovering profits and rights to no small extent. However, the capital of Chinese factories is mostly weak, and the scale and equipment are also simple and crude. Even with all their efforts, they cannot compete with foreign factories. Therefore, the proportion of business between the two sides still has the momentum of the guest dominating the host. In recent years, tax rates have repeatedly increased, making the burden even heavier. They are externally pressured by the fierce competition of foreign cigarettes and internally troubled by the encirclement of smuggled cigarettes. Chinese factories are in a difficult situation, struggling to cope. Many of those that have difficulty maintaining operations have announced their closure. The forty-odd factories that still stand firmly are reducing or stopping work due to the near-bankruptcy of the rural economy and the extreme dryness of social finance, as well as the even fiercer competition from foreign cigarettes. The business of Chinese merchants is becoming increasingly declining. Several factories have announced their closure again. Even those that are lucky enough to survive are reducing work and stopping work, making operations unstable and in a state of crisis. Compared to the booming atmosphere of the past, they cannot be mentioned in the same breath. This is why the China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association was organized. Since the business of Chinese factories is far from what it used to be, if they still act like swallows in a hall, content with the present and not urgently seeking salvation and a way to protect themselves, then great difficulties will arise in the future. The situation will collapse completely, and nothing will be left. Therefore, we must prepare for a rainy day and take measures to prevent problems before they arise. This is to ensure that the original business of Chinese merchants does not decline, but continues to strive towards a bright and splendid future. This is also what we, the members, are dedicated to.</p>
<p>Some doubt that cigarettes are a consumable item. This is true. But in general social situations, the need for cigarettes is quite extensive. All countries in the East and West are also popular. The United Kingdom and the United States are also famous tobacco-producing regions, exporting large quantities of cigarettes and tobacco leaves every year, occupying an important position in foreign trade. Therefore, governments promote and reward them to promote the development of industry. As for our country's tobacco-producing regions, there are many. Moreover, foreign cigarettes flood the market, resulting in a great outflow of wealth. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain the business of Chinese factories. Only then can the livelihoods of millions of workers be maintained, the products of tobacco farmers in various places be sold, and those who make a living from this indirectly can be without worry. Moreover, from the perspective of our country, where industry is still in its infancy, Chinese factories pay tens of millions of yuan in cigarette unified taxes every year, occupying an important position in the industry and also being a major source of income for the national treasury. Therefore, although it is a consumable item, it is crucial to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Chinese factories occupy an important position, as mentioned above. However, the heavier the position, the greater the responsibility. How should our Chinese factory colleagues conduct themselves and fulfill this important responsibility? It is important to unite with each other to consolidate the united front and move forward bravely to win the final victory. They should not each seek their own interests and only care about their own private gains, giving others a chance to take advantage and causing the disaster of being defeated individually. As for funds and talents, how should they be fully utilized? As for equipment and manufacturing, how should they be planned and improved? As for the cost of production, how should they strive to reduce it? They should all learn from the past and carefully study these issues. As for raw materials, they should especially lead by example and use domestic products as much as possible. This is to achieve the goal of mutual support and common prosperity for the entire national goods industry. If there are still domestic products that are not available and must be purchased from foreign countries, they should also work together to develop their creative spirit to solve all difficulties. This is what we deeply hope for from Chinese factories.</p>
<p>Alas, in this day and age, the country is in a difficult situation. The people are suffering. Just as they are waiting to recover, the tide of the global economic downturn is fiercely attacking. Our country is affected by this, and existing industries feel that they are on the verge of danger. Emerging industries are also being hit. The industries that urgently need to be maintained are not just the cigarette factory industry. Therefore, we, the members, do not dare to underestimate our own abilities and take the lead. Now, in order to expand publicity, we have designated August 8th as the National Goods Cigarette Festival and issued this special edition to loudly appeal in order to arouse the attention of our compatriots and leave a lasting impression. We sincerely hope that various industries will successively organize and support each other, so that the business of national goods will develop day by day. We also hope that the cigarette factory industry, which is growing stronger, will not be destroyed by the bad environment. This is what we cannot but hope for from the Chinese people, that they will all rise up together to maintain it.</p>
<p>China National Goods Cigarette Maintenance Association Standing Committee Members: Shen Xingde, Yuan Ludeng, Shen Weiting, Lao Jingxiu, Ding Houqing, Jing Yimeng, Bao Gengsheng, Ding Zhenbo, Wu Linzhi, Sun Daosheng, Shen Xuewen. Sincerely announce.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Don't Take It as Empty Talk <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bao, Teng Shugu</p>
<p>When a person is bored or overwhelmed with paperwork, smoking a few cigarettes can indeed find some stimulation and comfort. Therefore, cigarette sales are exceptionally good.</p>
<p>However, recently, the Chinese people's obsession with foreign goods is too great. They think that everything is better if it's imported. They also think that cigarettes are the same. Think about how alarming this outflow of wealth is.</p>
<p>In fact, recently, national cigarettes have been improving. The taste is good, and the price is very reasonable. Especially in these economically difficult times, why don't we buy and smoke national cigarettes? Besides, economic aggression can also lead to the demise of a country. We should all fulfill our national responsibilities and find ways to reverse this outflow of wealth.</p>
<p>Some people say that smoking foreign cigarettes has more "style." These are truly crazy words. From now on, we want everyone to advocate smoking national cigarettes and be ashamed of using imported goods.</p>
<p>I have been very busy lately. Shen Bao's Lao Sun (not Sun Wukong, but Sun Daosheng) asked me to write a "random sentence article." I respectfully comply and hope that everyone will not take it as empty talk after reading it.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Learn from the Spirit of Foreigners <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Min Bao, Wu Zhongyi</p>
<p>A German person said: "Only German food is most suitable for the constitution of the German people." He also said, "You must know that buying foreign goods affects the national economy and weakens Germany's national power."</p>
<p>The wool produced in the United States is far less excellent than that produced in the United Kingdom. However, the social leaders of the United States always like to wear clothes made of American wool. Few use excellent foreign goods to boast of their nobility. On the contrary, in our country, the so-called upper-class people always despise domestic products. Even for cigarettes, they believe that they must use imported goods. They seem to think that using domestic goods is enough to lower their status. The concept is so different, and this small item alone results in the outflow of tens of millions every year.</p>
<p>The reason why Germany and the United States are rich and strong, and our country is poor and weak, is self-evident. I hope that those in our country who worship foreign countries, in addition to using foreign goods, learn the spirit of foreigners.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Smoking National Cigarettes <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Nie Shiqi, Shishi Xinbao</p>
<p>Cigarettes have truly become a fashionable item nowadays. From grand banquets to rickshaw pullers, cigarettes are very popular. As for those of us in the news industry, we can't live without them. Every time we write an article or compile one or two headlines, we have to smoke one or two cigarettes. Otherwise, the article cannot be written, and the headline cannot be compiled. In social situations, if cigarettes weren't there to connect the emotions between guests and hosts, I'm afraid it wouldn't be so lively, because just exchanging pleasantries seems very monotonous. Furthermore, when a person is sitting alone or feeling troubled, a cigarette in hand can often solve loneliness and worries. Even if you don't smoke it, just watching the wisps of smoke is quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>I am not encouraging people to smoke. In fact, according to doctors' judgments, cigarettes are not very harmful. Don't we see many scientists and scholars smoking cigarettes? However, China likes to Westernize everything. Even when smoking cigarettes, people must use foreign brands. This is truly a great regret. National cigarettes are no worse than foreign products, and the prices are relatively cheaper. Why give the money to foreigners? If we can't promote the use of national cigarettes, the most widely sold product, to prevent great losses, what else can we talk about?</p>
<p>To those gentlemen promoting the national goods movement and patriotic gentlemen, this is a good opportunity to put it into practice. We promote national goods, starting with smoking national cigarettes. If our true patriotism is tested and strengthened by this, then we will not have to rely on foreign goods for anything.</p>

<p>— Sun Daosheng, Shen Bao</p>
<p>From "Chinese People Should Smoke Chinese Cigarettes" to "Chinese People Should Use Chinese Goods"</p>
<p>The establishment of the China National Cigarette Maintenance Association is not only to maintain the national cigarette business. It will also be used to awaken the Chinese people, starting with loving to smoke national cigarettes and ending with loving to use any national goods. In other words, only national cigarettes should be smoked, and any item should only be national. Our slogan is: "Chinese people should smoke Chinese cigarettes." Expanding on that, it will become "Chinese people should use Chinese goods." The success or failure of the National Cigarette Maintenance Association will also affect the rise and fall of the entire national goods industry. The biggest goal of the National Cigarette Maintenance Association lies here.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Regarding Smoking <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Han, Chen Bao</p>
<p>… Most people engaged in writing love to smoke cigarettes. Two friends of mine cannot write a single word when they don't have cigarettes. It seems that smoking can arouse "inspiration" (?). However, I don't think smoking necessarily arouses "inspiration" (?). At the very least, it can help boost brainpower, especially when feeling tired from work. Taking a few puffs of a cigarette can indeed increase excitement.</p>
<p>…I am poor and busy. I want to seek entertainment to please my mind and body. But I have no money and no time. For me, the only thing I can do is lie on the sofa, smoke a cigarette, close my eyes, and concentrate my mind, considering it a pleasure.</p>
<p>…Mr. Qian Huafo has a finely bound book titled "Yan Cheng," which is rich in content.</p>
<p>…As the saying goes: "A cigarette after a meal is better than being a living god." It is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>…I have a ten-year history of smoking and deeply feel the significant progress made in domestic cigarettes in recent years. Whether in terms of decoration, quality, promotion, or eliminating fraud, the numbers are astounding.</p>
<p>…A friend of mine can make a wisp of smoke into countless circles, like lotus flowers, a magnificent spectacle. This is also one of the unique skills of smoking.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The national goods industry today has some awareness. What are they aware of? They understand that internal competition will lead to failure, shoddy products will lead to failure, and disregarding costs and working in isolation will especially lead to failure. The unanimous hope now is to find a way out. Therefore, holding exhibitions, conducting inland surveys, and Northwest inspections are all methods of finding a way out. However, due to the repeated disasters and famines in the domestic market, the purchasing power of the people has reached its limit. Rather than being confined to the country, it is better to expand abroad. Therefore, foreign trade is also a broad road for the national goods industry. The day before yesterday, I met Mr. Zhang Huikang and learned that the China Industrial International Trade Association, organized by the International Trade Bureau, wants to promote national goods to the international market. Yesterday, I attended the opening of Zhaoji Huahang and met Mr. Shen Zhaoji, who organized the company to exclusively promote products from major national goods factories to Europe and the United States, gaining the sympathy of foreign merchants. Many national goods factories in Shanghai have entrusted Mr. Shen to manage sales. Mr. Shen's spirit of serving the national goods industry and working hard to find a way out for the national goods industry is worthy of admiration and support.</p>
<p>Another thing: Recently, enthusiastic comrades in the national goods industry organized a China National Cigarette Maintenance Association to promote the use of national cigarettes by Chinese people. Of course, as Chinese people, we should smoke Chinese cigarettes. No people in the world would be willing to betray their conscience and smoke foreign cigarettes. As Chinese citizens, we should, of course, smoke Chinese cigarettes and, more importantly, appreciate the service spirit of these enthusiastic individuals. In the future, whether we are offering cigarettes to others or smoking ourselves, we must smoke Chinese cigarettes to be worthy of the country, the society, and our conscience.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Regarding "Import Surplus" <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>Since the wave of recession quickly swept across the world, it suddenly caused deep unease in various countries. Of course, our country cannot be an exception and is also affected, and society is full of recessionary sentiments!</p>
<p>However, the recession in foreign countries is due to increased production and oversupply, while the recession in China is due to the constraints of unequal treaties by foreign powers and the mutual pressure of natural disasters and banditry, resulting in backward industry and insufficient production. Foreigners have already seen this, so they try to import excess goods into China as much as possible, exchanging them for white silver dollars, reducing the severity of their recession. But China is getting poorer and poorer, obviously creating a country with a huge import surplus!</p>
<p>In fact, import surplus in international trade is also a very common phenomenon. A country with an import surplus is not necessarily harmful to its own country. As for some that are detrimental, it depends on the nature of the imported goods. If the imported goods are raw materials such as machinery and steel, then although money flows out, the result can greatly increase production and exports. Isn't this kind of import surplus a great benefit?</p>
<p>However, let's try to list the imported goods in China: mostly rice, sugar, oil, cloth, cosmetics, etc., all of which are purely consumable products that cannot be re-produced to pay for the imported goods. As a result, cash continues to flow out!</p>
<p>As for trade between foreign countries, it is based entirely on the principles of equality and reciprocity, exchanging industrial products for industrial products, exchanging what is available for what is not, and both parties benefit. China, however, not only pays in cash, but also exports mostly crude and cheap raw materials. Foreigners add packaging and sell them for multiple times the value. In the end, we are still the ones who suffer!</p>
<p>So, here, I think we should not calculate the import surplus and export surplus with short-sighted eyes. In order to develop industry and increase production efficiency, we should make more use of foreign production tools, such as steel, raw materials, machinery, and production equipment. Import surplus is inevitable when developing production. On the contrary, the large-scale export of raw materials is not something to be optimistic about! Compatriots! We must completely transform imported consumer goods into direct or indirect production goods. Then, even using foreign goods is equivalent to promoting national goods. In the future, industry and commerce will advance by leaps and bounds, production will increase significantly, and self-sufficiency will be achieved, and the import surplus will gradually decrease!</p>
<h3 id="e154">The National Goods Industry After the Implementation of Industrial and Commercial Loans <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>— Should Strive for More Fundamental Solutions</p>
<p>After a long period of preparation and several negotiations with the government, industrial and commercial loans finally began to be implemented the day before yesterday. In the current situation where the recession is enveloping the entire market of our country, a wave of industry and commerce is dying out, and the financial community is firmly holding on to a tight policy. Now, we have unexpectedly obtained such a large sum of money as a supplement to make economic turnover flexible. I think, of course, many industries will be able to use this to overcome the crisis and create a new path for the future of national goods, giving the market a very good influence. Its effect and power cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>However, here I also deeply feel that this method of industrial and commercial credit lending is really only a stopgap measure. Moreover, the total amount for the entire city is only 5 million yuan, and each household is limited to 5,000 yuan. In such a large city, the gathering place of national industries, the limit is so small that it is inevitable that it will be a drop in the bucket. Therefore, during the handling of the loan, I dare to express the most ardent hope that the industrial and commercial circles and the financial circles will not forget the fundamental revival movement, that is, the national goods movement. We must know that there have been huge import surpluses over the years, and huge amounts of waste have flowed out. Under such circumstances, how can the national economy not be poor and how can industry and commerce not decline? Even according to the customs reports of the past two years, the import and export trade of our country has decreased significantly, and the amount of import surplus has also been relatively reduced, but that precisely reflects the weakness of the purchasing power of our general public, and the market is becoming increasingly bleak. If the import and export trade is estimated, the import surplus has not decreased slightly. The improvement of China's economic future and the development of national goods production and industry and commerce are always hopeless.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the end, I dare to point out very definitely that our current national goods industry, under the new economic assistance, must seek to consolidate its own foundation and work hard from various fundamental ideas, such as (1) resolving industry competition, uniting to save ourselves, (2) improving technology, reducing costs, and selling at the lowest price to compete with foreign goods, (4) rapidly paying attention to the promotion of border provinces and the opening of overseas markets, which are the most urgent plans now. In addition, I hope to thoroughly cooperate with the financial community to create greater industrial credit lending to promote domestic industry and the export of local goods. In this way, the two aspects of treating the symptoms and treating the root cause will advance side by side, and the current misfortune of national goods can definitely turn danger into safety.</p>
<h3 id="e155">A Word of Advice <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— (Tian She Weng)</p>
<p>National goods manufacturers should publish their experiences in this publication at any time. Don't focus on empty talk, but seek practicality, so that readers can study and imitate them.</p>
<p>Collect national goods manufacturers to conduct effective publicity in this city or inland to promote national goods at low profits.</p>
<p>Operate with sincerity and honesty, and do not engage in boring price reductions and gifts.</p>
<p>Managers and factory directors should be capable, honest, and hardworking, and should not engage in fraudulent or cunning behavior.</p>
<p>Employing people with impartiality, clear rewards and punishments, both kindness and authority, without favoritism, without fraud, and without employing useless cronies are all essential elements of success.</p>
<p>Industry jealousy is the main reason for the suicide of national goods. We should embrace the principle of benefiting ourselves and others, work together to resist foreign goods as our own responsibility.</p>
<p>Promoting national goods should be a joint effort by government officials and gentry. Social rewards and punishments also have great power. Zeng Guofan said: "What does the thickness of customs come from? It comes from the hearts of one or two people." I say the same for revitalizing national goods.</p>
<h3 id="e156">May Major Middle Schools and Universities Hold Independent National Goods Exhibitions! <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Daozhen</p>
<p>In this year of the "Student National Goods Year" that is raging across the country, the obvious significance of holding exhibitions everywhere is nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>1. To make students realize the importance of promoting national goods: Promoting national goods is, on the one hand, to resist the economic aggression of imperialists and prevent the outflow of rights and interests, and on the other hand, to increase and develop the opportunities for national industries, wash away the shame of material poverty, and create a Chinese machine civilization to realize the thorough success of the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>
<p>2. To enable students to understand the common sense of national economic geography: The display of concrete national products can give students a little common sense about national economic geography that they cannot get when listening to lectures on foreign economic environment in the classroom. I hope to arouse a curious mind to do a precise research work.</p>
<p>3. To enable students to contact the inner heart of national goods: Those who are usually dressed in foreign clothes, mixed in foreign markets, dyed with foreign ideas, and smoked with foreign air can cool off and wake up your national soul here! You must know that only national goods can show you the spirit of China, and only national products can show you the geographical advantages of China. Improve the shortcomings and develop the strengths. Take this opportunity to work hard to eradicate past mistakes.</p>
<p>However, in the various exhibitions held now, most of them focus on primary schools, browsing around, and do not pay attention to middle schools and universities, which is inevitable. In fact, it is necessary to promote and instill knowledge for primary school students to use national goods, but they are not as deeply intoxicated with Europeanization, fond of modernism, and fond of foreign goods as middle school students and university students!</p>
<p>All middle school students and university students, whether male or female, are mostly in the period of youth and adulthood. They always like to study and adopt imported products for all clothing products. This kind of atmosphere is by no means formed in a single day. Their disease of being intoxicated with Europeanization, despising national products, and not using them can be said to be deeply rooted, which makes people shudder. Therefore, if we do not apply a strong-hearted medicine in this year of "Student National Goods Year" to promote their rapid awakening and recognition of national goods and the use of national goods, there will be no chance to reverse the tide. Therefore, I hope that in the future, the authorities of various middle schools and universities should shoulder heavy responsibilities and devote themselves to preparing an individual national goods exhibition for the school itself, collecting the products of various national goods manufacturers, and often displaying them for browsing. Although there is now a "Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation" holding mobile exhibitions in advance, I am afraid that its whip is too long to reach, and its power is insufficient, making it difficult to achieve universality. If major middle schools and universities can hold their own independent exhibitions, the general students in the school can get the opportunity to know and approach national goods near the water tower, silently move and potentially transform, which is more powerful. As far as I know, a middle school student or a university student who wants to purchase national goods or use national goods often does not know where to buy them to avoid being deceived. They do not recognize the brand names of national goods merchants, nor do they know the trademarks of national products, which leads to a cold heart of trying and hesitates to move forward. The number is not small, which is really regrettable. Therefore, I put forward this question of "May the authorities of major middle schools and universities hold independent national goods exhibitions" for the adoption of the authorities of major middle schools and universities, what do you think?</p>
<h3 id="e157">Opinions on Holding National Exhibition Meetings <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhang</p>
<p>Recently, according to newspaper records, national goods exhibitions and national goods sports meetings are being prepared very actively everywhere. It is expected that in the near future, the national goods movement will have a vigorous performance. From the standpoint of the national goods industry, this situation is indeed a phenomenon worthy of rejoicing. However, judging from the situation of national goods exhibitions in various places in the past, I feel that there are several points that should be studied and improved. Now, I will express some opinions of mine for the reference of those who preside over the national goods exhibition:</p>
<p>First, what I want to contribute to the national goods exhibition is the hope that there will be a strict organization and a sound organization. You must know that an unsound organization is the least able to achieve great results. This is the case with anything, and holding a national goods exhibition is naturally no exception. In the past, some national goods exhibitions in various places have been plagued by unsound organizations. For example, it is an undeniable fact that non-national goods were disguised as national goods at a national exhibition in a certain place. Therefore, I very much hope that future national exhibitions must pay close attention to the organizational aspect.</p>
<p>Second, what I want to contribute to the national exhibition is the hope that the selling price of goods in the national exhibition must be equal to the local selling price. Because if it is not like this, it is easy to make the local industrial and commercial circles feel dissatisfied. For example, the opposition of the Zhenjiang business community to the Zhenjiang business operations of the National Goods City Shopping Mall is a very prominent example. Therefore, here, I want to sincerely contribute to the gentlemen who organize the national exhibition, to know that dumping at low prices is the easiest way to cause opposition from local people.</p>
<p>Third, what I want to contribute to the national exhibition is the hope that the rent will be cheap. At present, in general national exhibitions, if manufacturers are willing to participate, the rent for each room must be at least 30 yuan or more. This is certainly not a problem for large-scale national goods factories, but generally small factories do not have the opportunity to participate because of this. In the past, what we saw in the national exhibitions was that the participating national goods manufacturers were all well-known national goods factories, and it was rare for small factories to be able to participate in the question. This situation seems to seek fairness, but the reason why small factories did not participate, in my opinion, is probably because the rent is too high. Therefore, here, I also want to contribute to the gentlemen who preside over the national goods exhibition, and it is also necessary to pay attention to this point. You must know that there are good national goods in small factories, and it is a pity if they do not have the opportunity to participate because the rent is too high.</p>
<p>Fourth, what I want to contribute to the national exhibition is the hope that during the time of holding the national exhibition, more national goods publicity or masquerade speeches will be held to make the general public understand the significance of holding the national exhibition and arouse their interest and determination to purchase national goods.</p>
<p>The above four opinions are what I thought of temporarily. Because the angry wave of holding national exhibitions is rising again recently, I have no regard for the simple publication of Sichuan, and I hope that the wise will not hesitate to teach Zheng, then I am very fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Organizing "National Goods Purchase Groups" <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>"Promoting national goods" is useless if you just talk about it. It is only effective if everyone can speak and act.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic compatriots who support national goods may gather their relatives, friends, or neighbors, as many as they want, and organize a "National Goods Purchase Group." Everyone should encourage each other and strive to not drink non-national beverages, not eat non-national foods, not wear non-national clothing materials, and not use non-national products. The goal is to make all the items seen and touched in the homes of each member of the group purely domestic products. We should treat foreign goods that suck people's blood like mosquitoes and bugs in summer, and use various methods to prevent them from invading and existing in our homes.</p>
<p>When such groups are organized, they can add a lot of fun. Everyone puts the responsibility of supporting national goods on their shoulders, which is a glorious thing! It is also pleasant in one's own heart.</p>
<p>We also hope that in the future, Chinese national goods manufacturers can conduct further research on the manufacture, effectiveness, quality, and price of goods, with the ultimate goal of achieving true "cheap and good quality."</p>
<p>Let's say that consumers and manufacturers should proceed separately and take on their own responsibilities!</p>
<h3 id="e159">County Towns Should Organize National Goods Markets <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Although the capital is the source of the national goods movement, relying on the promotion and advocacy of a few people is biased and insignificant. Metropolitan men and women are excellent members of the national front line, and promoting national goods can achieve twice the result with half the effort. They know how to love the country, they know how to identify domestic products, and each of them has received considerable education and has the ability to read newspapers. People in county towns are relatively backward in everything, their thinking is closed, and their aspirations are often dominated by knowledge. Asking for one or two national product exhibitions is only for half a month. There are not many literate people, and they are unable to identify trademarks. The national goods market is an emerging organization that is unimaginable. In the past two years, only some deformed businesses have been seen in the county town, and some even drive the people to extravagance! A small county town has branches of five or six banks. A person with knowledge, Xi Zhaojia, named it: the world of banks. Following the rise of banks are pawnshops, which cultivate the speculation of the market and the personal theory of getting rich. We should know that enriching the country and enriching the people is the responsibility of the masses. If businessmen are unwilling to work an inch or a foot on the road to enriching the country, and the ignorant people often misunderstand that entertainment can really save the country, they often open several amusement parks in a small city less than three miles away, cultivating the bad customs of the people. In this way, they are invisibly advancing ten feet on the road to national subjugation. I sincerely hope that each county will establish a permanent national goods market, and ask the business leaders and silver money giants of each county to strengthen the strength of the national economy and stand up to establish some reputation in neighboring counties. The party and government authorities should give guidance and supervision. This kind of national goods market should communicate with the national goods organizations in the metropolis. In addition to selling the famous local products of each county, it is necessary to pay attention to household daily necessities and the required cloth for clothes. As for cosmetics and consumables, it is not hoped that they will become the main business in the national goods market in the county. Selling more local products is the fundamental strategy for teaching and helping the inland handicrafts industry. It is much more practical than empty pity for the livelihoods of the unemployed. When the county people have a destination for purchasing domestic products, they do not need other publicity and persuasion. Nantong coarse cloth, Rugao blue cloth, and Shanghai Pudong wool cloth are all examples. I participated in the last meeting of the seventh district of the Shanghai Student National Goods Year Promotion Federation, and there was a proposal that students should be responsible for persuading people to use domestic goods when they return to the inland during the summer vacation. However, many students have the suffering of having no way to persuade people. Who dares to guarantee that the store is purely selling domestic products? This has become a huge problem. I think that preparing for the establishment of a national goods market in the county town is an urgent matter at present. Even rice, wheat, and flour should be sold one by one, because this is a large amount of food, and the flag of non-national goods has long been flying to remote cities. Their footprints are already boundless aggression.</p>
<p>It is really necessary to prepare for the establishment of a national goods shopping mall in the county town. I think that all the temples, civil education centers, or public places in each county are the most suitable places. I hope that enthusiastic people in each county will act quickly. (Editor)</p>

<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>A country without external enemies will always perish! This sentence means that calamities can revitalize a nation. But look at the pain of China being insulted in recent years? Losing thousands of miles of land, precarious as a pile of eggs! Science is inferior to others, and the nationalistic ideas of our compatriots are inferior to others. The external enemies of our ancient country are enough to cause great pain and suffering! The last effective weapon for revitalizing the country lies in everyone loving and using national products, especially the employees serving in national products companies! They should be like warriors on the battlefield, with only the courage to kill the enemy and defend the country, and absolutely no reason to engage in internal strife! Undermining their own battle lines! Reading about the chaos in a certain national products company in a newspaper, I cannot help but feel worried again. Therefore, I pick up the pen and write "The Credo of National Products Company Employees" below.</p>
<p>(1) Colleagues who have the fate to gather together should be of one heart and mind, unite and cooperate.</p>
<p>(2) Sharing weal and woe, colleagues should eliminate class concepts.</p>
<p>(3) Methods and experience of guiding customers to purchase domestic goods should be discussed together.</p>
<p>(4) Eliminate frivolous behavior between male and female employees, and ban smoking, drinking, prostitution, and gambling.</p>
<p>(5) Employees should jointly adhere to the oath to use national products, setting an example for customers.</p>
<p>(6) Employees should pool their wisdom and offer opinions on selling national products to the manager.</p>
<p>(7) Leaders should eliminate selfishness and be fair and impartial to employees, and should not harbor favoritism or animosity based on hometown or personal relationships.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Education News: The Ministry of Education Approves Provincial Implementation Plans for Compulsory Education: Gansu, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, and Seven Other Provinces Have Been Approved; Shanghai, Qingdao, and Yunnan Provinces and Cities Are Being Revised <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing Correspondence) Since the Outline of Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education in the 24th Year of the Republic was decided and promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education has actively prepared for the implementation of compulsory education nationwide. First, it formulated the Central Compulsory Education Funding Allocation Measures and announced the allocation of 1.4 million yuan of central compulsory education funding (the 800,000 yuan of Qing Dynasty indemnity subsidy and 500,000 yuan of border education funding have not yet been allocated). In addition, the Implementation Rules for the Measures for Implementing Compulsory Education, the Provisional Regulations for the Annual Short-Term Primary Schools, and the Curriculum Standards for Short-Term Primary Schools have been successively promulgated and ordered to be followed by the Education Bureaus of various provinces and cities. From this, it can be seen that the central government has great determination for compulsory education, which is by no means comparable to the empty talk and perfunctory behavior of the past. The Ministry of Education, for the implementation plans for compulsory education in various provinces and cities in the 24th year of the Republic, in addition to ordering the responsible education administrative personnel of each province and city to go to the Ministry for face-to-face consultation, also ordered each province and city to formulate and submit its implementation plan for compulsory education in the 24th year of the Republic before July 20 for approval by the Ministry and implementation accordingly. As of the time of issuance, the implementation plans for compulsory education that have been approved by the Ministry include Gansu, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Henan provinces. The plans of other provinces and cities, such as Shanghai, Qingdao, and Yunnan, have not yet been approved and have been ordered to be revised and resubmitted. In addition, Hebei Province has been delayed due to the relocation of the provincial capital, and the Ministry of Education has approved an extension for submission. By the end of this month, the implementation plans for compulsory education in various provinces and cities across the country should be approved and implemented by the Ministry of Education. The following is a summary of the compulsory education plans of the provinces that have been approved by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Gansu: Class A counties, such as Fugang and eight other counties, will each establish 15 short-term primary schools, totaling 120 schools.

Class C counties, such as Wenxian and 45 other counties, will each establish 10 schools, totaling 450 schools. Zhuoni will establish 5 schools. In total, Gansu Province will increase the number of short-term primary schools by 743 in the 24th year of the Republic. The funding and allocation are as follows: the start-up fee is 210 yuan per school, totaling 156,030 yuan; the operating fee is 180 yuan per school, totaling 133,740 yuan. The start-up fee will be raised locally. If the operating fee is insufficient, it will be supplemented by the border education fund and the compulsory education fund allocated from the Boxer Indemnity.</p>

The schools established by the Lianbao units in the first year should have 7,000 schools, increasing gradually from the second to the fifth year, so that the compulsory education funding reaches 30% to 40% of the total education funding of the province.</p>
<p>Zhejiang: In the 24th year of the Republic, 1,326 primary schools and 1,242 classes of short-term primary schools should be established, requiring a total of 311,680 yuan. 207,82 yuan will be raised by the central government and the province, and 102,538 yuan will be raised by the counties and cities. The annual expenses of each short-term primary school are 80% for salaries, 10% for supplies, and 8% for office expenses. The average annual expenditure per school is 180 yuan, and the expenditure per class is 80 yuan.</p>

The allocation of funds is as follows: In the first year, the central government subsidizes 120,000 yuan, the province raises 170,000 yuan, and the local government raises 150,000 yuan, totaling 440,000 yuan. In the second year, the central government and the province raise 537,000 yuan, and the local government raises 240,000 yuan, totaling 777,000 yuan.

<p>— Originally Written by Ms. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>"Little darlings, let them have one day in which they can shout, make noise, and laugh to their heart's content. A holiday is not a holiday if it doesn't have a lot of freedom and playfulness. Therefore, they must have one good, unrestrained noise every week," Mrs.裴 often expressed her opinion in this way. People who were generally reserved and strict were surprised to find escalators, pillow fights, and all kinds of unrestrained games in the usually quiet house of Plum Village.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it seemed that the house was in danger of being torn down, but it never happened, because Mr.裴's word could always bring quiet at any time, and the children knew that freedom should not be misused. Therefore, although there were many dangerous predictions, the school flourished on its own, and the students gradually learned etiquette and cultivated their virtues, without anyone knowing how it happened.</p>
<p>Ned felt particularly comfortable at that time. In front of him was a tall porcelain milk jug as a barrier, Pang Tao-mo sat around the corner, and Mrs.裴 was by his side, filling his plate or cup whenever it was empty.</p>
<p>"Who is sitting next to that girl at the other end?" Ned asked his young neighbor lightly during the laughter.</p>
<p>"That is Bai Xiao-qiao. He is Mr.裴's nephew."</p>
<p>"That name is really strange."</p>
<p>"His original name was Qiao-en, but they call him Xiao-qiao because his father is also Qiao-en. But it is written as 'a bridge' Xiao-qiao. It's a joke, don't you think?" Tao-mo said, explaining it patiently. Ned, though not understanding, smiled along and added with particular interest:</p>
<p>"Isn't he a very lovely child?"</p>
<p>"Of course, he is very knowledgeable."</p>
<p>"Who is the fat one next to him?"</p>
<p>"Ah, that is Ke Tai-fei. His name is originally George, but we call him Tai-fei because he eats too much. The little guy next to Uncle Pei is his son, Robert, and that tall freak is his nephew. He also teaches a little, as if taking care of us."</p>

But why not take this opportunity to launch a charity performance match, which would kill two birds with one stone and have even greater significance.

Mr. Tan Jing-jun, President of the China Tennis Club, has always been enthusiastic about public welfare and agreed to lend the club's courts. Xu Cheng-chi, Lin Bao-hua, and others are very willing to serve the afflicted and believe that this kind of disaster relief is a responsibility that the sports community should have, so they deeply sympathize.

<p>The Rikkyo University table tennis team from Tokyo, Japan, was hosted by the Shanghai China Table Tennis Federation for this expedition to Shanghai, and all the competition arrangements and results were very good. According to the team's skills, only the second and third teams are indeed top-notch players, and the rest are mediocre. However, the reason why they have achieved such results is entirely due to their spirit of perseverance throughout the competition. Therefore, the outcome of the game is often decided by a narrow margin, which is enough for our players to emulate. After the competition, the team took a day trip to Suzhou on the morning of the 5th. After returning, they took a boat back to China at 9 am yesterday morning. Those who went to the pier to see them off included representatives from the Shanghai China Table Tennis Federation and the Japanese Table Tennis Association in Shanghai. The team's visit to Shanghai is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Won against Japanese Residents: 5 to 2</p>
<p>Won against Guangdong: 4 to 3</p>
<p>Won against 琊: 4 to 2</p>
<p>Lost to Jingwu: 3 to 4</p>

<p>Yang Heng-hua, a swimming athlete from the South, is currently studying at Zhongda University in Guangzhou. He and his brothers Yuan-hua and Xu-men are all known for their swimming. They are known as the "Three Heroes of the Yang Family" and are comparable to the "Four Generals of the Shi Family" in the North, mirroring each other and adding to the interest. Yang has one year left at Zhongda before graduating. Now that it is summer vacation, he has come north for sightseeing. He arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 1st. It is learned that Yang will stay in Shanghai for about two months before returning south to study. It is expected that after graduating next summer, he will come to Shanghai for a long time. His brother Xu-hua will also come here and will arrive in Shanghai soon. Yang is skilled in backstroke, freestyle, and water polo. His recent results are 28 seconds for 50-meter freestyle and 1 minute 19.9 seconds for 100-yard backstroke, which are comparable to national records. Yang is a veteran in the swimming world and has been selected as a representative for the 9th and 10th Far Eastern Games, and has represented Hong Kong at the 2nd National Games and the last Hong Kong Games. His water polo skills are almost invincible. He is currently a key member of the Hong Kong and Guangzhou water polo champion teams.

<p>Catching bedbugs must be done in the middle of the night, which shows how prepared people can be.

<h3 id="e189">Remembering Qiu <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Zheng Qiu was my student thirty years ago, and now I suddenly hear of his death. How can I not be saddened? Recalling the past, we were together morning and night. Sometimes we would talk over a cup of wine, or discuss essays with enthusiasm. It is all like yesterday. When promoting new dramas, we formed the New People's Society. I wrote the explanatory notes for all the plays we produced. Many of them are still in my collection.</p>
<p>At first, the revival of new dramas competed in showing off fashion. There were jokes like Cai Yong wearing a top hat and Tang Yin wearing a braid. Zheng Qiu was not satisfied. He thought it was an insult to celebrities and a reversal of ancient and modern times. How could this be the essence of actors telling stories through their own experiences? So he changed to historical dramas to promote history. The first play was "Wu Song" from Water Margin. At that time, the New People's Society moved to the Tianxian Garden site on Shilu Road. Wang Wuji played Wu Song, Wang Youyou played Ximen Qing, Xu Banmei played Wang Po, Chen Jinghua played Pan Jinlian, Zhang Yeer played Yun Ge, and Zheng Qiu himself played Wu Dalang, whose nickname was Three-Inch Ding Gu Tree Skin. They performed for two nights, labeling the play "Historical Costume Drama" and "Killing the Sister-in-law to Avenge the Brother." Therefore, the box office was very successful for a time.</p>
<p>Later, in the Minming Society, he performed in the play "Hidden Pain." Zheng Qiu played Wang Laoda, adopting a prologue from my "New Shanghai Future Chronicle in Happy World" (Happy World was published in the 30th month of the Republic of China, co-founded by me and Tang Zijisheng, and stopped publishing after the second issue). His sharp words and metaphors for current affairs were so moving that the audience tapped their feet and sighed, penetrating the heart. This can be called a unique path for spoken drama. Although Liu Yizhou and his generation (Liu performed new dramas under the stage name "Wooden Bell") were known for their speeches on stage, compared to Zheng Qiu, they were like the great wizard compared to the lesser one. Later, Zheng Qiu entered the film industry and I parted ways with him. Almost ten years have passed. I was busy with schoolwork and also because of my decline, I practiced quietness and regarded internal reading as my life, and viewed chasing after fame and fortune as a danger. Who knew that our paths would be so different now, and that we would be separated by life and death so suddenly?</p>
<p>Zheng Qiu's life was known to many contemporaries, but from his childhood to his adulthood, I was the most familiar with him. When I have some time, I will write another article to commemorate him, also to write out my heart and to shed old tears. Alas! Zheng Qiu, if you have knowledge, you will surely see it.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Beef Stall Owner <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>When the sun reached the side of the tall chimney of Ewo Factory, the beef stall owner came hurrying over with his heavy load, moaning "Aiyo heng aiyo heng." After all, he was a man in his fifties, and although he was still the same fat man, his energy was limited. Look at his limping steps, it was quite pitiful.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the alley, he put down the load, took off the piece of cloth that had turned gray from white and was stained with oil, revealing chunks of red beef, beef tendon, and beef tripe... He then took out a rectangular wooden board and a gleaming kitchen knife from the wooden bucket behind him. He sat on the wooden bucket and wiped the sweat from his neck, some of which sprinkled on the beef.</p>
<p>An old customer—the drunkard A-he—came running up: "Beef stall owner, cut fifteen copper coins worth of beef, I'll pay thirteen and owe you two." The beef stall owner kept saying, "It's okay, it's okay." He then reached out with his greasy hands to cut the beef, slicing it as thin as mulberry paper. His technique was skilled. He wanted to cut it even thinner, both to satisfy the customer and to avoid losing money himself. He once said to someone, "You can't do business in this market without being a little cunning, or you'll end up losing your wife too."</p>
<p>"Why are your things getting more and more expensive, beef stall owner? You know everything is cheaper now!" The drunkard A-he was dissatisfied. According to his allocation, he wanted to buy four ounces of liquor and take half back to his wife and son for soaking rice. He started eating it, chewing the flavor strand by strand, and then swallowed it.</p>
<p>"Are you still cheating on an old customer? Really, I earn a copper coin to buy medicine. Currently, the foreign exchange rate is over three thousand four hundred, and beef has to be bought with silver dollars. Think about it, doing small business is really not something a human being does." He gritted his teeth. He reached out to wave away the many flies on the beef. One of them followed the drunkard A-he and flew away.</p>
<p>The front of the stall was deserted again. He chatted with the small shoemaker who was packing up his stall, saying that he had a dream yesterday in which he opened a church, but suddenly a fire broke out in the stove... and he woke up in fright. The small shoemaker said to him, "You're going to be a big boss." The beef stall owner smiled bitterly, thinking, "A man who's about to die of old age." He watched the sun go down.</p>
<h3 id="e191">After Reading the Wooden Fish Boat Song <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Chuan-an</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Lanshan's Wooden Fish and Dragon Boat Song in this journal, I found that there were some discrepancies between the text and the facts. Based on what I know, I am now making corrections. If you say that I am nitpicking, then that is not my intention.</p>
<p>In the past, those who sang "Wooden Fish Books" mostly beat wooden fish to accompany them. Nowadays, they are replaced with small drums. As the name suggests, the name "Wooden Fish" came from this. The distribution of the story mostly originated from popular folk novels, such as "Regeneration Green" and so on. The plot is nothing more than loyalty, filial piety, chastity, righteousness, joys, and sorrows. Many people in my Guangdong hometown would hold a volume in their hands after tea and wine, singing to their heart's content, as a supreme pastime.</p>
<p>The "Bao Yu Cries at the Coffin" excerpt published yesterday was not a Dragon Boat Song, but a Bangzi slow tempo in Cantonese opera. It was a signature masterpiece of the former young actor Feng Qing-ji. This kind of publication does not belong in the "Dragon Boat" section.</p>
<p>In the past, those who sang "Dragon Boat Songs" were mostly wandering beggars, holding a wooden carved dragon boat in their hands and a small gong drum tied to their chest, singing auspicious dragon boat songs and begging from door to door. Most of them were old women and blind old men, who had no one to rely on. People also pitied them for their old age and were happy to provide for them. Nowadays, new tunes are emerging in the Cantonese opera world. Each new tune incorporates various small tunes, and Dragon Boat song scores are no exception.</p>
<p>"Autumn Regret on the Road" and "Lamenting the Fifth Watch" are famous "Southern Tunes," which were once popular. They are not Dragon Boat Songs. I recall that ten years ago, Mr. Yan Yuechi, the editor of the drama review column of this newspaper, wrote about this. He said that if you don't believe it, listen to Bai Ju-rong sing the Dragon Boat section of "Scolding the Crown Prince" and the "Autumn Regret on the Road" record (produced by Victory Company). The tones are different, and it is easy to distinguish.</p>
<p>There is also a "Cantonese Ballad," which is also one of the folk literatures of Guangdong Province. It was created by Zhao Ziyong's "Night Hanging Autumn Joy," which is sad and charming and was recited for a time. Even today, the Cantonese newspaper industry still has a Cantonese Ballad column to publish such texts to add to the fun.</p>
<p>As for "Saltwater Songs," they mostly involve stories of love between men and women, chasing and answering questions. However, the lyrics are vulgar and not worth taking.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Do Not Ask About a Daughter’s Body, Hidden Pain Hard to Speak Of, Eagerly Watching the Nobleman’s Face, Together Admiring the Lofty Demeanor</p>
<p>Yueying said, "Master Jia said they are dressed in rags, cannot speak properly, and do not understand etiquette. If they were to run into acquaintances here, it would be very embarrassing, so he doesn't allow them to come." Huanhua stood up and walked to the table, picked up a cup of tea, and slowly drank it, her eyes sizing up Yueying from head to toe. She asked, "Is this the reason you're feeling so down? Is there anything else that's bothering you?" Yueying said, "I've only been with Master Jia for a day; how could I possibly say?" Huanhua smiled, "When a woman is a new bride, her husband always uses sweet words to coax her. Did Master Jia use any sweet words to coax you?" Yueying blushed and smiled slightly. But the smile was very brief, and she immediately stopped and sat with a stern face. Huanhua thought for a moment and smiled, "Do you like Master Jia?" She remained stern. Huanhua said, "Do you hate him?" Yueying said, "Why would I hate him? He didn't seize me; he bought me with money." Huanhua said, "Are you at least a little afraid of him? If you weren't afraid of him, why would you stay inside with the door closed just because he told you to?" Yueying smiled faintly at first, then sighed and said, "I eat their food and wear their clothes; how can I not listen to them?" As she finished speaking, her eyes reddened. Under these circumstances, Huanhua had understood about eighty or ninety percent of the situation. So the two sat facing each other, each silent. For about twenty minutes, neither of them spoke. Then there were footsteps approaching the door, and someone asked, "Huh! Why isn't the door closed?" With this, Jia Duocai came in. (284)</p>
<h3 id="e193">Records of Lingering Fragrance from the Imperial Palace <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>It was roughly like this: For example, if one day she wanted me to do something, even if I felt it was wrong at the time, I still did it according to her wishes because I didn't dare to disobey her orders casually. After it was done, of course, everyone knew it was wrong, but no one dared to criticize it. The Empress Dowager herself would just pretend she hadn't seen it and wouldn't say a word. Then, after four or five days, or six or seven days, when we had completely forgotten about the matter, she would admit it herself.</p>
<p>"That day's matter really was my mistake!" she would always say.</p>
<p>Hearing her say that, I really wished I could say, "That's right, it was your mistake!" But I would never dare to be so presumptuous; I could only think it in my heart.</p>
<p>Now, to speak of the Empress Dowager again, because she didn't want the matter of banishing the Guangdong governor to linger in her mind, causing her to feel unhappy, she was eager to do something more joyful to forget all her troubles. She thought for a long time and finally came up with something.</p>
<p>"These days, the lotus flowers must be blooming profusely; tomorrow morning, there must be hundreds more blooming!" she said to us. "So tomorrow morning, we must all get up especially early and go to Kunming Lake together, take the yacht, and enjoy the scenery to our hearts' content. Everyone remember: we must set off before breakfast!"</p>
<p>Because such an interesting pastime was planned for the next morning, it immediately swept away all the Empress Dowager's worries. Even until she went to bed to rest, she didn't show any signs of irritability or anger. It seemed that even after going to bed, she fell asleep earlier than usual, and she snored frequently, sleeping very sweetly. (384)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3 id="e194">Random Talk on Goldfish <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Youchen, section chief of the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Plant, is very fond of raising goldfish in his spare time. At first, he kept a few tanks to play with in his residence. Later, the fish increased day by day, so last year he gathered three comrades and organized a "Goldfish Paradise Cooperative." On the east side of Dumuqiao Road in western Shanghai, they opened a garden of more than two mu, purchased two hundred sand tanks and twenty cement ponds. The scale is very large, and the collection is especially rich. All kinds of coarse and fine breeds from the north and south are available. Among them, there is a "Five-Colored Dragon-Type Pearl" which can be said to be the champion of all of Shanghai, because this species has never been seen outside. At the moment, the garden opened on the fourth of this month, and Ms. Gu Lanjun, a movie star who also has the beautiful name of "Goldfish Beauty," performed the opening ceremony. Ms. Gu's elegant title was acquired that day at the banquet at Guansheng Farm in Caohejing. On the day of the opening, congratulatory guests and customers were very lively. Mr. Chen plans to set up a retail department after starting business, so the 50,000 to 60,000 small fish harvested this year will surely sell quickly.</p>
<p>Last month, a few fish enthusiasts organized a "Chinese Ornamental Fish Society." Unfortunately, one of the initiators, Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, fell ill the day after a dinner and passed away in just four or five days. This can be said to be a loss of a leader for our ornamental fish comrades, and it is very regrettable and mournful.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mr. Xi Guansheng asked me to talk, and he graciously invited me to manage the goldfish at the farm. I said, "Isn't there Mr. Chen Zhongying managing it at the farm?" He said, "He has another job at the factory, and he is also an amateur when it comes to goldfish. He only took care of them before. In the future, we will ask you to handle it, so you can use your expertise." I am very grateful to him, and on the one hand, I can tell my friends that if you have anything to do with goldfish, look for me. I will definitely be at Guansheng Farm every morning.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from Mr. Liang Diancheng of Yangzhou. He told me that he had recently returned from Tianjin and had visited Nankai University in Balitai, Tianjin, to see the goldfish raised in their garden. According to Mr. Liang's letter, "I spent more than eight thousand yuan on raising fish, and I thought I raised them well enough. Who knew that when I saw the fish at Nankai, not a single one of my fish could compare to theirs? Nankai only raises about ten kinds of fish, but they are all exquisite and unparalleled, definitely not comparable to those in the 'Central Park' and 'Western Hills' in Beijing. The bodies of their fish are unusually large, with about three or four hundred that are seventeen or eighteen inches long (equivalent to one foot five inches on a tailor's ruler). The tails are as large as banana leaf fans or large basins, and the bodies are as fat as large rice bowls. The selection of species is even more indescribable. 'Hat-head with everted gills and a ball,' 'Toad-head with everted gills and a ball,' 'Tiger-head with a ball,' 'Telescope-eye dragon with everted gills and a ball,' etc., are not easy to see elsewhere. What is especially mesmerizing is the 'Longevity Star Head with a Mound of Flesh.' The red growth on the top of this fish's head reaches a height of two inches, and unfortunately, there is only one of them. Mr. Liang lingered by the side of the pond, pacing back and forth three or four times, and was reluctant to leave even when it was getting dark. It can be said that he had seen the ultimate." Liang also said that he knew that raising fish was not easy and could not be compared to growing flowers and raising birds, which can be achieved on a small scale. Goldfish are delicate and cannot live mixed in rivers and shores, mingling with the water spirits. Because they have no self-protection ability, Heaven has dressed them in gorgeous brocade scales and transformed them into various beautiful forms to please people. Therefore, fish enthusiasts steal half a day of leisure to admire them. Seeing their swimming joy, their scheming minds gradually disappear, and they forget the hardship of the whole day. And that is how goldfish are able to survive and continue to reproduce. Mr. Liang is truly a connoisseur and can be called the most ardent of fish enthusiasts.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Major Financial Players Actively Chase and Buy: Yesterday's Bidding Price for Gold Fell and Then Rose <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Rebounded Beyond the 900 Yuan Mark: Ended Up with a Rise of 13 Yuan</p>
<p>After the previous sharp decline in the gold market, the downward trend was too strong, and a rebound was inevitable. Yesterday, the market was weak but rebounded, with major players actively chasing and buying. The foreign exchange market was the same, triggering a rebound. In the end, it rose above the 900 yuan mark. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed level supply for both the UK and the US, with slight fluctuations in the Monte Carlo forward silver price and a sharp drop in Indian silver prices. Foreign exchange rates also fluctuated narrowly. The London spot gold price shrank by one and a half pence. Outside of the market, preliminary trading opened, although it rose to 94.5 yuan, general sentiment, based on reports that the authorities have a very earnest explanation for the expansion policy, still seemed soft. Therefore, although major players such as Fuxingyong, Shenfeng, Hengyu, Hengchangyong, etc. entered the market, selling pressure was difficult to curb, and prices gradually declined. Major players such as Yuanchangyong, Fuyu, Huixiang, Wanfeng, Changda also came to sell bars, and the price dropped to around 90 yuan. The Central Bank's published exchange rate showed the UK and US still level, and the customs gold unit shrank by three li. The gold standard price fell to 922.3 yuan. People's hearts were still settled. Yongli, Hengyu, Yifengyong still entered the market, causing the morning opening to be slightly higher. After the opening, sellers still poured in, the foreign exchange market was still loose, and it retreated within the 90 yuan mark. The situation was weak, but major players made efforts to maintain the price at a low level, and there was still a rebound. It was learned that the HSBC exchange rate showed the pound rising by 0.125 and the US dollar rising by 0.3125. The upward trend was temporary, and there was still a decline. When the bank stepped in to settle, it rose back to above 90 yuan. At this time, Sassoon's domestic goods were selling US dollars, which took quite a bit of struggle. Soon the bank still had buying intentions, the process became tight, and buying sentiment began to recover. Major players chased and bought, the market fluctuated and rose. The Hong Kong market reported softness, but Chinese merchants' sentiment rebounded and they settled their accounts. The foreign exchange market became tighter, and it broke out of the 900 yuan mark. Even if major players took the opportunity to sell at a high price, people's hearts rebounded, and floating short positions were covered. Although it fell, buying sentiment did not weaken. It is predicted that silver will be slightly volatile, and the midday trend will still be strong. The future is indeed difficult to predict. Now, let me record the market situation for half a day:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 891 yuan, up 0.3 yuan from the previous closing. It then reached 1.7 yuan. Fuxingyong, Hengyu, and Dadecheng sold bars, retreating to 88.5 yuan. Hengyu, Fuyu, and Wanxing accepted bars, rising to 90.3 yuan. Hengyu, Hongkangyong still sold at 89 yuan. Chunyuanyong, Yongli, and Dadecheng still came to maintain the price, and it rose again to above 91 yuan. The August shilling at 1.125 could be settled. Hengyu, Yingxiang, Dadecheng, Yuxinxiang, and Wanxing sold off, falling to 87 yuan. Chunyuanyong, Fuxingyong, Yuanyi, Yongli, and Hengyu took advantage of the low price to accept bars, rising to 90 yuan. It was learned that the HSBC exchange rate showed the pound rising by 0.125 and the US dollar rising by 0.3125.

<h3 id="e196">Securities: Sellers of Various Bonds Covered Short Positions <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise and fall of market prices at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange depended entirely on the Xixian Incident, and the situation was extremely simple. However, due to varying news, there were different buying and selling situations. However, there were fewer sellers, with the most sellers being Numbers 7 and 15. Number 48 absorbed opportunities, and Number 21 clearly covered short positions. Therefore, the trends of the opening and closing were completely opposite. Such is the extent to which the environment can influence the market. Yesterday's course saw more selling from retail investors at the opening, and military cuts fell sharply by 0.5 yuan, and the situation on the table suddenly became weak. Afterwards, Number 72's appetite for advancement suddenly became strong, taking advantage of the trend. After the 23rd level, it was consistently strong, and Zhengliu even rose slightly by 0.1 yuan. The news turned better in the afternoon, and market prices rose unanimously. Those who had gone long recovered about 0.5 yuan, and Numbers 11 and 48 continued to buy in, and 96 gradually turned to a higher peak. The situation was strong, and there was a possibility of continued gains. The final result was that market prices were still uneven, with more gains than losses. The most gains were from Zhengliu and 96 at 0.4 yuan. Military cuts were still down by a small 0.15 yuan. The total transaction volume was 9,185,000 yuan. The comparison of the results of the rises and falls is listed on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan).</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Results Were Slightly Lower</p>

<h3 id="e197">Cotton Yarn: Buying Activity Resumes Due to Rising Standard Price <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>After two days of sharp declines, the yarn market rebounded yesterday. This was due to the standard price breaking through the 900-yuan mark again, which spurred buyers to actively purchase, leading to a gradual increase in market prices. However, current yarn sales are very sluggish, with no positive developments from any of the trading houses. This is because the higher prices are deterring customers. Nevertheless, speculators are collectively buying in, believing that there is a possibility of a rebound since prices have fallen by ten yuan from their peak. Foreign firms, however, are holding steady.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Down Three Yuan Recently</p>
<p>The forward market for standard yarn opened weak, influenced by the previous day's sharp decline. However, prices for distant months were slightly higher. Due to consecutive days of declines, prices had fallen by eight or nine to ten yuan from their peak. Some expected a rebound and a recovery of two to three yuan. As a result, new sales were not strong, and the market showed a slight upward trend. By the third closing, prices suddenly rose because the standard price recovered, and multiple parties began to push prices up. The market turned higher, with each month's closing price rising by 1.7 to 0.9 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. The afternoon session opened with thin trading volume. Because the standard price closed at its peak, bulls seized the opportunity to become active, and the market suddenly surged. However, actual yarn transactions were only about 300 bales. As a result, each month's price rose by 0.8 to 1.13 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales figures were: Tongji 650 bales, Yuda 1250 bales, Zhenda 1300 bales, Yuan Yi 700 bales, Yuan Da 400 bales, Senkang 500 bales, Shenji 550 bales, Yongchang 700 bales, and Yongda 500 bales. Purchases were: Tongfu 450 bales, Dafu 900 bales, Yida 950 bales, Daji 650 bales, Hexing 1950 bales, Renfeng 850 bales, Changfeng 950 bales, and Runkang 900 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Actual Sales Only 440 Bales</p>
<p>The spot yarn market is exceptionally quiet. Total purchases by all trading houses throughout the day were only 340 bales.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose. August futures for old cotton are being strongly held by bulls, and the concept of a short squeeze has not disappeared. Distant-month new cotton is also being affected. However, the overall weather conditions are good, and the new cotton in Tongzhou and surrounding areas is developing well, promising a good harvest. However, most cotton merchants are in a bullish position and have absorbed a significant amount of volume.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Recovers by Four Jiao</p>
<p>The forward market for standard cotton opened weaker, except for the current month. Distant-month new cotton had become significantly weaker after a large sell-off by Daji the previous day. Furthermore, news about US cotton was weak, and prices for each month fell by 0.15 to 0.2 yuan. However, by the third closing, prices rebounded as the gold market recovered, with each month's closing price rising by 0.05 to 0.12 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. In the afternoon session, because the standard price broke through the 900-yuan mark again, sentiment was shaken, and bulls once again added leverage, causing each month to jump up by 0.3 yuan. However, foreign firms remained indifferent, and each month's price rose by 0.15 to 0.24 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales figures were: Meiji 1400 dan, Changji 1200 dan, Yuda 2900 zu, Shenchang 2800 dan, Tongxing 2400 dan, Yuan Yi 1800 dan, Changfeng 3700 dan, Yuanxingchang 2800 dan, Hexing 1100 dan, Yichang 1800 dan, Yikang 1000 zu, and Xinheng 1500 dan. Purchases were: Tongfu 2900 dan, Dafeng 2700 dan, Taixing 2200 dan, Xiesheng 1200 dan, Dachang 1900 dan, Shengyuan 3800 dan, Xincheng 1600 dan, Yifeng 1900 dan, and Renfeng 2200 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption is Minimal</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is extremely sparse. Factory demand is weak. Incoming sources are estimated to be 1100.</p>
<p>Northern Cotton Crops Affected by Drought</p>
<p>Cotton crops in the provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi were estimated at 1.8 to 2 million dan during the same period last year. This year, current estimates are 1.7 to 2.1 million dan. Due to the severe drought in Shandong and Tianjin, the harvest is estimated to be reduced by half. There is also damage near Jinan. The cotton concentrated near the mouth of the Yellow River, particularly towards Zhangdian, has suffered considerable damage. Recent breaches of the Yellow River near Weishan Lake have only damaged crops like sorghum and soybeans; cotton crops have not suffered any significant losses.</p>
<p>Rumor of Cotton Not Being Shipped to New York Slightly Increases US Cotton Prices</p>
<p>US Cotton Recovers on Short Covering: US cotton opened yesterday with an unstable market and hesitant traders. Prices for each month rose by 4 to 8 points. Positive news from Liverpool and purchases by foreign firms, along with rumors that cotton would not be shipped to New York due to export subsidies, were the main reasons for the slight increase in prices. Subsequently, some retracement occurred, and brokers sold in the afternoon, causing the market to weaken again. The weather remains favorable, but spot demand is sluggish. Textiles have improved. At the close, some short covering occurred, resulting in a stable market. Spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures prices rose by 1 to 6 points. British spot cotton rose by 2 points, while futures prices fluctuated between a decline of 2 points and a rise of 6 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to the strong July White Raw Creek futures, but then fell due to profit-taking by bulls and selling by speculators. Ping Guo Er and Aomura fell by 0.75 rupees. July White Raw Creek rose by 3 rupees, and April-May futures fell by 1 rupee. Original telegram on the left. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>White Raw Creek Cotton Forecast to Rebound: Another dispatch from Mumbai reports that the opening forecast for April-May White Raw Creek cotton on the 7th is 213 rupees, up by 0.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>US Government Cotton Forecast: New York, 6th: The US cotton's first cotton crop report will be released at noon on the 8th. Based on various private estimates, the forecast production volume is 11,431,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Grains: Flour Futures Customers Have Ample Margin for Difficult Times <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed signs of sluggishness. Foreign wheat quotes fell by about 45 jiao in Chicago and rose by 0.1 yuan in Canada. Market sentiment is influenced by the gradual release of current flour stocks by various factories. Although market prices still need to increase by about 0.05 yuan, customers have ample margin, and the standard trend is inevitably being affected. Furthermore, most small investors are being blocked, and factories are slightly hedging, so near and distant months are seeing softer market conditions. However, current wheat market prices are not willing to decline. If foreign wheat orders are unfavorable, there is a possibility of changes. As a result, the current month fell by 0.01 yuan, September fell by 0.025 yuan, October-November fell by 0.075 yuan, December fell by 0.005 yuan, and January fell by 0.075 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Wheat Market Prices Unlikely to Be Cheap <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally calm after the morning opening. Chicago foreign wheat was quoted down 45 jiao, and Canada was up 0.1 yuan. However, market sentiment is that the current wheat trend is quite stable. Wheat prices in both local and outside ports show no signs of softening. Therefore, although transactions were not brisk, market sentiment was able to hold steady, mainly because inland wheat merchants are mostly unwilling to take risks by selling futures for distant months. As a result, there were no changes in prices for any month compared to the previous day. The spot wheat market also showed a slight upward trend because local quotes have not changed, and the supply arriving daily is exceptionally weak. Asking prices from various parties are also 0.01 to 0.02 yuan higher.</p>

<p>River Rice Sales Sluggish and Falling Again</p>
<p>(Shanghai South): Yesterday, 15 or 16 barges arrived (with a total of over 3000 shi). After the sales market weakened on the afternoon before yesterday, the market opened yesterday. The main street was particularly sluggish. Qingdao and Yantai trading houses only handled about 400 bales, so the overall situation was exceptionally quiet, and the market color turned softer. As a result, the prices of Sutung japonica and Nangangzi paddy rice were reduced. Various thin paddy rice prices also fell by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. Dongxin japonica rice remained at its original level, with no significant changes. Qingjiao Yangjian has not yet been sold.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North): Yesterday, 14 or 15 river barges arrived. The market for white japonica rice was sluggish, with prices down 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. Early rice arrivals and sales were both active, and the market was stable. There were continuing transactions of sporadic high-quality thin rice, while medium-quality rice was more sluggish. The market was stable for high-quality rice but weak for medium-quality rice. Arrivals of Dongxin japonica rice were quite strong, and sales were also good, with prices stable. Sporadic sales of Baiyuan were flat, and the market was firm for the high-end and soft for the mid-range. Other goods also saw peaceful trading.</p>
<p>Nanjing New Brown Rice Sold Out Yesterday: Saigon No. 3 Traded at a Premium of 0.05 Yuan</p>
<p>Unwilling to sell cheaply, the market remains firm. In particular, Saigon No. 3 has low inventory, and hoarders are steadfast. Yesterday's selling price was reported to be up 0.05 yuan. Other prices remained stable. A total of 6000 bales of Saigon rice, 1000 bales of small pressed rice, and 470 bales of Siamese Su japonica rice were sold throughout the day, mostly handled by the main street. Inland areas such as Nanjing and Jiujiang were only moderately responsive. Foreign rice in inland areas has mostly satisfied its appetite, and new rice will soon be on the market, causing inland selling prices to gradually fall. Yesterday, 500 bales of Saigon No. 1 rice were returned from Hangzhou and sold at 10.04 to 10.037 yuan. Furthermore, early indica rice will be launched on the market in sequence. 117 bales of new brown rice arrived from Nanjing the day before yesterday and were purchased by factory owners on the main street yesterday at a price of 7.8 yuan. Early brown rice from other provinces may arrive in Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Tax Increase Rumors Not Extinguished: Soybean Cake Falls Another 0.05 Foreign Currency: New Soybeans Arriving in Succession: New Mung Beans Arriving in Bengbu</p>
<p>The soybean cake market was originally stable, but since the sudden rumor in the market the day before yesterday that Guangdong Province would again increase construction donations (last year, 0.8 yuan was collected per zu), Shantou market sentiment has been sluggish. Although 9700 jin of various spot and futures cakes were traded yesterday, market prices have plummeted by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. "Customer cakes are still stable." Currently, the Oil Factory Association and the Grain Association have sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting a telegram to waive the tax increase. The outcome is still uncertain. New soybean sources are arriving in succession, and cargo owners are lowering prices to sell as a result. However, the market is quite weak. Yesterday's selling price fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day, and the number of transactions remained low. Changzhou, Benniu, and Niupi yellow soybeans were sold for 400 bales at a price of 3.78 and 3.77 yuan. Lingkou Niupi yellow soybeans were sold for 300 bales at a price of 3.76 and 3.75 yuan.

<p>Wuyuan Dabang green tea has traditionally been sold to American firms in very large quantities. In recent years, sales have plummeted due to competition from Japanese tea. This year, the sales of some lower-quality goods among Dabang have been poor, making the situation even more pessimistic. Yesterday, Jinlong Foreign Firm purchased over 200 boxes of fragmented Rongchang Yonghe Shengxiang Che Sheng Jingmei No. 4 grades from Zhongxinchang Tea Firm at prices that were 25% lower than last year. The sales of high-grade green tea such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei to the Cuoco markets remain strong. The focus of Gong tea's foreign trade has shifted from the major markets of Russia and the United States to ports in Cuoco and Africa.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Oil Market: Wuhan White Tung Oil Continues to Fall - Hongjiang Oil Falls Outside of the Official Market - <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Wuhan white tung oil prices rose too quickly, and foreign firms were unable to support the market. Last week, prices fell directly from 48.6 yuan per dan to 45.9 yuan. After entering this week, the market remains weak, and prices continue to fall, dropping to 45.2 yuan, then to 45 yuan, and then to 44.9 yuan. It is normal for a sharp rise to be followed by a sharp fall. However, because foreign firms have excessive demand, it is easier to rise sharply than to fall sharply. This current decline is slow and tortuous, because inventories are too thin, and foreign firms are showing signs of trying to buy. Therefore, although prices are falling, the decline is not severe. If foreign firms make more transactions, the price could still jump back to its original level. Therefore, the future market is always easier to rise than to fall. Zhejiang tung oil also follows Wuhan's market, but its fluctuations are not as severe. Last week, Hangzhou traders sold for as high as 39 yuan per stone in Shanghai. Recently, it has also fallen slightly and is now selling for 38 yuan. However, full-weight goods may not be available for less than 43 or 44 yuan.</p>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil should not have fallen in price during the summer sales season due to the reduction in production last year. However, some in the industry are deliberately trying to manipulate the market by selling off at 25.46 yuan per barrel and even as low as 24.8 yuan. However, this is not the official market price and is done for other purposes, intending to attract small profits. However, the market has reached this point, and those unwilling to lose money would rather hold and not sell. It is also heard that those from Hakka do not approve of cheap sales. From this perspective, a turnaround may be easy. July (Commodity Inspection Bureau Report)</p>

<h3 id="e204">An Evaluation of Bazarov <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Lai</p>
<p>When we read Arzybashev's Sanin, we always feel that there is a cynical character among the people we encounter over time. When we read Goncharov's Oblomov, we seem to feel that many friends are tainted with that kind of weak-willed and frivolous problem. We can also find Lu Xun's Ah Q from our neighbors, and Cervantes' Don Quixote from travelers from afar. ... The greatest achievement of these many literary archetypes is that they can evoke a sense of intimacy and a vivid sense of reality in readers. At the very least, they always make readers feel that any of the archetypal characters are like friends or enemies they have met before. Based on this significance, let us examine Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" and Bazarov. Let's see if such a person as Bazarov exists among the masses, and let's try to give him a fair evaluation.</p>
<p>Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons," a history of the conflict between two different generations in Russia in the 1860s, depicts Bazarov, representing the "son" generation, as a nihilist. This can be clearly seen by observing how he argues with Paul, who represents the "father" generation.</p>
<p>"I don't understand you... How can a person not recognize doctrines and rules? What do you base your actions on?" - This is Paul's question.</p>
<p>Bazarov corrected him, "We consider what is useful to be the basis of our actions. At this time, the most useful thing is denial"...</p>
<p>"Deny everything?"</p>
<p>"Deny everything."</p>
<p>"What? Not only poetry, art,... but... it's terrible to say"...</p>
<p>"Everything." Bazarov calmly repeated.</p>
<p>The reason why Russia's great womb was finally able to give birth to a brand new generation should be clearly explained here: It was because Russia had already produced wild characters like Bazarov in the 1860s. Such characters, in any era, are responsible for catalyzing history, and they often inevitably complete a tragic life. Because most people, as Bazarov's opponent Paul said, "They regard all traditions as sacred, they obey elders, they cannot live without faith." However, it is precisely because the lives of these characters are filled with tragedy that they deserve the greatest praise.</p>
<p>Naturally, Bazarov is not entirely without flaws. On the contrary, because he is a vivid character taken from real life, it is obvious that he has flaws. He confessed, "Everything depends on feeling... Take myself as an example. I take a completely negative and denying attitude because my feeling is like this..." This kind of game of idealism also adds to the tragic composition of Bazarov's life.</p>
<p>Therefore, Bazarov is often willful. Although he criticized all the ugliness of reality and slandered all the hypocrisy of society, this tendency should be praised in the sense of accelerating the birth of the old womb. However, he does not demand practice. "I am determined not to do anything," he said. When he answered his opponent, he also made it clear that he just wanted to laugh at everything. From this, we can infer that he is similar to a demagogue in a certain sense, precisely because he does not correctly recognize the reason for his own growth process.</p>
<p>It is because Bazarov has the above-mentioned shortcomings that he is not a person who fell from the sky. Moreover, he is brave, insightful, and he still has the evaluation he deserves. In fact, he is not unaware of his own shortcomings. When his friend Arkady was preparing to get married, Bazarov himself said:</p>
<p>"—At the time of parting, I will say to you again: what you are doing is very clever; because you are not suitable for living our rough, painful, and drifting life. You have no sharpness, no resentment, although you have the courage of youth and the spirit of youth; but it is not enough to do our kind of movement. People of your aristocratic class can at most bear some beautiful patience and express some beautiful indignation, but they can't go beyond this, what is the use! ... But we have to fight. Our dust flies into your eyes, and our sweat splashes all over you,"... This clearly proves that Bazarov has corrected his shortcomings to some extent. Similarly, at the time of his death, he still confessed so modestly.</p>
<p>"...Russia needs me!...No, no, it is obvious that there is no such need. Who is needed? Shoemakers, tailors, butchers"...</p>
<p>However, we should say that we need Bazarov! He lives vividly among the masses, and his shortcomings are even known to us. Because he is not a savior in mythology. His appearance can make us feel his existence clearly. In any case, in this difficult century, it goes without saying that people like Bazarov will still be respected, right?</p>
<h3 id="e205">Knows How to Do Business <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>"At the master's house!" This has long become an idiom in my hometown, meaning "you have to make do a little"; because life in your own home is always simpler than in the workplace. When I came back from school, I had to drink river water that always had a muddy taste, and I had to clean the table and mop the floor myself. Even reading a newspaper and sending a letter required me to go out in person. It just so happened that my leather shoe soles had long been worn through and were leaking, so I had to buy another pair of overshoes.</p>
<p>My salary was only enough to cover a little, and I spent a lot on the road, so I planned everything carefully. Before I went out on the street, I asked the people at home what kind of overshoes were good; they all said that it was worth buying the old brand.</p>
<p>When I got to the grocery store, a thin, fair-skinned young man came out to greet me. After he knew what I wanted, he took out a paper box and opened it for me to see.</p>
<p>"I want an old brand," I said, putting the pair of black overshoes back in the box.</p>
<p>"Isn't this an old brand?" the young man said, taking the shoes out again to show me.</p>
<p>"Are there any other old brands?"</p>
<p>"What old brand do you want?"</p>
<p>"Double Coin brand."</p>
<p>"Isn't this it?"</p>
<p>What he was pointing to was the scissors logo; "Double Coin" and "Double Scissors" sounded similar, and the shapes were similar, but they were not the same brand.</p>
<p>"I want Double Coin brand!" I repeated.</p>
<p>"Oh! That's long gone," the young man replied loudly, "There's no Double Coin brand goods anymore!"</p>
<p>"Then what about Da Xi brand or Su Zhu brand!"</p>
<p>"That's even more out of the question; I won't lie to you, sir! This is the best old brand of overshoes now!"</p>
<p>According to my inherent habit, when buying things, I always take the quality into consideration, but I always pay more attention to convenience. As long as it's almost good, I often blur it over. But since I had discussed overshoes with the people at home, I felt embarrassed to be too casual; I thought it might be a good idea to go to another shop to take a look. After expressing that I didn't want the Double Scissors brand, I turned around to leave. The rain was still falling, and the road was very muddy; my toes already felt water seeping in, and it was too difficult to walk on the wet road again. Just as I was hesitating, I suddenly felt a light pat on my shoulder. I turned around to look, and the young man picked up another pair of overshoes and said to me, "This one is the best!"</p>
<p>I took it in my hand and saw that it was the Double Coin brand I wanted.</p>
<p>"How did you just say that this brand doesn't exist now?" I couldn't help but ask him.</p>
<p>"Haha!" he replied triumphantly, "This is really the best old brand! If you want it, I'll sell it to you!"</p>
<p>"Then the Double Scissors brand isn't 'the best?' How did you just say it was the best?"</p>
<p>"Haha! Double Scissors brand is good, Double Coin brand is even better!"</p>
<p>Although he said it very freely, the young man's words were always contradictory; but he also said it in a very serious and energetic way, which made me no longer want to buy from him. The matter was obvious. It was nothing more than because the Double Scissors brand had a higher profit margin, so he wanted to play this trick. Merchants put money first, and lying is not a big deal. It's good to be able to see the wind and steer the boat and adapt to the situation. This young man will always be "successful" in the future; I have no way to name him, so I name him "Knows how to do business."</p>

<p>— By German author Storm, translated by Chen Yin Zhi</p>
<p>She lowered her head, pressing her forehead against the window pane; the white rose was still fragrant on top of her shiny black hair. "He was only a person. In life, he was just a foolish and pitiful man," she said, almost sobbing, "but he was always my father, no one else would love me like he did—if he were alive, he wouldn't reject me now."</p>
<p>After she said this, we were both silent. I unconsciously grabbed her hands, and she let me. Suddenly, I heard from the other side of the room, near the small portico, the 'Count' calling her name.</p>
<p>She trembled all over. "Nali," I said, "Can't you get away from that person?"</p>
<p>She looked at me with wide, melancholic eyes. "I can!" she said softly. I seemed to see a smile appear at the corner of her mouth, but this smile seemed to contain a mysterious element. At this moment, the calling sound rang out again, and it came closer to us.</p>
<p>She quickly wiped away her tears. "Goodbye, Philip, goodbye!" she said in a low voice. I felt her small hands squeeze mine, and then she walked away.</p>
<p>I don't know how long I wandered in the woods. It wasn't until the music in the hall suddenly stopped, allowing me to hear the hooting of an owl in the forest, that I sobered up.</p>
<p>To walk from the stone steps to the path, I still had to pass in front of the house; at that time, I saw Nali once more. She was standing in the corridor, with her arms wrapped around a pillar, looking through the woods towards the sea, where an electric light was dazzlingly reflected on the water.</p>
<p>Seaside</p>
<p>I lay on the mattress, unable to fall asleep for a long time. I was planning how to rely on my mother's help to give Nali a place to live, but the most difficult thing was how to convince Nali to be willing to go there.</p>
<p>I woke up very late the next morning, waking up to see 'Mayor' Fritz—I often called him that when I was young—standing in front of my bed, smiling at me with his honest eyes. Soon we were both sitting on the sofa, and Fritz talked endlessly about our friends in Heidelberg. But I only listened to him with half an ear—the events of last night were still lingering in my mind.</p>
<p>Soon after, at my suggestion, we went out for a walk. We walked side by side along the seaside on the elm tree-lined path, and at this time, I poured out the words that had been accumulating in my chest, telling him what I had heard and seen about Nali. Fritz listened to me in silence, sometimes cursing in a low voice, kicking stones on the road with his feet, or making a stabbing gesture in the air, as if his fist was holding a sword.</p>
<p>This gesture was not without meaning; eight days later, he stood opposite the 'Count' on the dueling field. In the duel, the 'Count' forcefully slashed a sword from left to right, and Fritz was injured in the face; now, when he gets angry, the scar still glows red on his forehead.——</p>
<h3 id="e207">On the Ferry Back Home <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>With a light heart, I boarded the ferry back to my hometown.</p>
<p>Having been away from my hometown for a long time, now I stepped on the ferry back home again. A kind of indescribable familiar feeling of hometown stroked the heart of a traveler.</p>
<p>On the ferry, I heard the accent of my fellow villagers, which I hadn't heard for a long time.</p>
<p>For half a year, I had been wandering in a small mountain city in northern Anhui for the sake of life, and all I saw was a gray and dilapidated scene. In just this half year, however, I was tired of seeing the sky filled with yellow sand and the dark mountain ridges. In the small mountain city, I was tired of hearing the noisy gongs and drums all day long, the heavy accent; and the life of swallowing sour and spicy dishes with bland steamed buns. From then on, I experienced the bitterness of life.</p>
<p>There were no beautiful mountains and rivers there, and the Huai River rolled with muddy yellow waves; the mountain peaks were bald, and the rugged mountain roads made me tired.</p>
<p>Now stepping on the ferry back home, a stretch of green water, wrinkled with smiling-like soft waves, and the green water spreads out the familiar homesickness. In the distance, the green mountains emerge on the light blue horizon.</p>
<p>Where the smoky trees are broken, there are several farmhouses, and the lush green willows hang upside down on the clear water, and clear cicada sounds float from the willow bushes.</p>
<p>Blocks of fresh green paddy fields floated past before my eyes, and old farmers, with their brown legs bare, were working in the paddy fields.</p>
<p>Along the way, I casually chatted with a former elementary school principal who was on the same boat; he told me that half a month earlier, there had been no rain, and there had been a panic about drought here. Fortunately, it had rained several times in a row, and the fields could be expected to recover!</p>
<p>The ferry sailed along the clear green water, and the lookout tower of my hometown stretched out before my eyes, and I could see it.</p>
<p>There were many female students returning to their hometowns on the same boat, leaning against the window, facing their hometown and singing softly. In a round and soft singing voice, the hometown gradually became visible before my eyes.</p>
<p>The boat reached the pier, and many male and female servants on the shore, with smiling faces, came to welcome the returning masters, young masters, and young ladies!</p>
<p>I thought that in recent years, my family had long since declined with the times, and maids had not been hired for more than two years.</p>
<p>Carrying my suitcase, and with a little sadness, I stepped ashore.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Family <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Shengshi</p>
<p>No songs,</p>
<p>No laughter,</p>
<p>The home is like a</p>
<p>broken drum that has long</p>
<p>been silenced,</p>
<p>leaving only a sense of decline.</p>
<p>There used to be days of laughter,</p>
<p>days of easy living.</p>
<p>The home is already in the years of</p>
<p>wind and frost,</p>
<p>declining and dilapidated.</p>
<p>The white chalk walls have long turned dim,</p>
<p>and black bricks are exposed,</p>
<p>like rotten sores on the skin.</p>
<p>The climbing ivy is wildly prosperous,</p>
<p>it strangles the phoenix tree and collapses the wall.</p>
<p>A flower bed of bees has also run away,</p>
<p>like these little creatures,</p>
<p>they have also seen the changes in the family.</p>
<p>Adulthood is accompanied by poverty and worry;</p>
<p>Under the simplest life,</p>
<p>no improper dreams are allowed,</p>
<p>and hope is pitifully thin.</p>
<p>The home is like a broken drum that has long been silenced,</p>
<p>leaving only a lonely melody of loss.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Three Years <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Di</p>
<p>Another three years have passed in an instant!</p>
<p>The rapid passage of time really makes people feel a bit flustered, but the original self remains, teaching the wandering heartstrings, playing empty, sad, and famine-stricken melodies. In this vast sea of people, I only encounter nails everywhere, and I have seen enough of many people's cold eyes. Every lively street and quiet alley may have been imprinted with my own footprints, becoming a bubble in the sea of people.</p>
<p>Wandering life has been going on for more than three years, but it has only been three years since I was driven out of the famine in the countryside and became a wanderer in the city. The number of three years accumulated cannot be considered very large, but the wounds are already cutting through this sad heart! A person wanders at the end of the world for a little hope of life, but hope is just like a rope, tightly tightening around your body, saying that you can't move, even if it allows you to move, it's like joking and playing with you. Life is so real.</p>
<p>In these long and short three years, although I have not tasted the bitterness of life universally, people are selfish, who can have a little sympathy for their own kind?</p>
<p>I have heard enough of the roar of the sea breeze, and I am tired of seeing the neon lights of this city, but during the day my wavering heart is like a banner, fluttering and struggling in the flow of illusory dreams. I once used an adventurous eye to inspect the depths of this city, but the deep-hidden, miserable groans require a special perception to listen to those groaning sounds. The misery of life is even worse than the three years I have experienced.</p>
<p>Everywhere is struggling for one's own life, for seeking, but how long is life? The slide of three years is fast. And this invisible time and space is burying its own youth, struggling for three years, it will carry its own desolation to the vast, unknowable future years, stepping into the realm of decay. So, for the past three years of wandering feelings, I recall the taste of olives. However, the dangers of time and the rampant greed disturb people's hearts. When will be the day of sufficiency? I can't help but admire the past three years again!</p>

<h3 id="e210">Dispute over the Ban on Coeducation in Ping City <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The issue of Ping City's ban on coeducation in private middle schools has aroused criticism from all sectors of society, and now the dispute has expanded. On the one hand, the city government insists on not allowing coeducational schools, and has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to strictly prohibit private middle schools from enrolling female students, and to establish the Second Municipal Girls' Middle School to provide placements for transferred female students. On the other hand, the private middle schools have also submitted a request to the Ministry of Education through the Federation, to stop the Ping City authorities from banning coeducation, and at the same time, they are still enrolling female students. Now the Ministry of Education has sent a telegram to the Ping City authorities with some instructions, but the Social Affairs Bureau has not made the original telegram public due to some reasons. However, it claims that the Ministry of Education, in principle, agrees with the case of single-sex schools. The private middle schools say that the Ministry of Education's reply to the Federation only ordered them to wait for a solution, and did not explicitly say that coeducation is not allowed, and they want to ask the Social Affairs Bureau to read the original telegram. The two sides are currently deadlocked in this dispute.</p>
<p>A country's education system should be unified. Coeducation in middle schools in our country is allowed by the middle school regulations. It has been practiced in various parts of the country for a long time. Unexpectedly, Ping City suddenly took the step of banning coeducation in private middle schools, which is inconsistent with the Ministry of Education's regulations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the ban on coeducation in Ping City is implemented, the problem of transferring female students from general private middle schools will inevitably arise in the future. The newly established Second Girls' Middle School enrolls students above the second grade, which is inconsistent with the middle school regulations of the Ministry of Education. Moreover, the original private middle schools in Ping City are divided into commercial and normal departments, while the municipal girls' middle school only has ordinary classes. This will inevitably make it impossible to place female students who transfer. The Ping City authorities should give considerable consideration to this point.</p>
<p>The education sector in our country is really terrible, and in recent years, various meaningless storms have been frequently stirred up. Now the Ping City authorities advocate single-sex middle schools, which is also a superfluous move. According to recent news reports, Guangzhou will also follow suit and implement the ban on coeducation. I don't know if this is because the school spirit in middle schools in Beijing and Guangzhou is particularly bad, so the authorities have to strictly ban it, or is it because the thinking in the north and south is particularly unique compared to other places? However, rectifying the school spirit by separating boys and girls is not a smart way. This can only be regarded as a means of destroying women's education.</p>

<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>(1) Waves</p>
<p>I once had such an opportunity to relive my dream of a naive wild child in a place where no one paid attention.</p>
<p>It is such a vast desert that you can't see the end of it even if you strain your eyes. This desert is constantly beating, reflecting the faint but shining light that penetrates from the moon, and it is reflected in the roar-like waves. The surroundings are quiet and empty, without any mixed sounds, and the empty echoes dutifully broadcast the waves, chasing the waves, and the magnificent and soft sound of the waves beating against the waves. The desert plays the moving Marseillaise revolutionary song, a tune that yearns for freedom, soaking the entire space. I, an ordinary person, will not be an exception. The unstable floating life of the past year, coupled with the rumors, slanders, and exclusions among friends, has turned me into a silence close to an old man, but at this time, it also becomes active.</p>
<p>So, I straightened my chest that had been wounded by arrows, I spread my pair of powerful arms that I could still be proud of, I faced the waves that were constantly chasing and pointing, I cracked my vocal cords that had been broken by people, and I shouted wildly, like an inhuman wild bull. The magnificent echoes comforted me, and the high tide of the waves encouraged me, making me forget that I was originally hiding in an inconspicuous corner of this man-eating metropolis.</p>
<p>Since I was a child, I have grown up in the arms of the sea. For the sea's majestic appearance, I have worshiped like a religious believer worships his "Lord," and there was a time when I was willing to give everything I had to the sea, let the sea control my future, and turn me into someone like a wave, doing my best responsibility in the whole. The waves seem insignificant; but the waves have done their best for themselves.</p>
<p>——Put your whole body, like a wave, responsibly against the shore! Entrust your whole future to the sea! Turn yourself into the sea, and struggle in the tireless effort to create that magnificent and majestic future!</p>
<p>In this way, I forgot that I was originally a wild child who came out of a high-temperature layer above 100 degrees, and I forgot even more some guys who only seek their own welfare in the "individual" circle and overthrow others, and I forgot even more that this was originally a turbid world, even to the point that I forgot that I was "homeless" on such a night.</p>
<p>Respectable waves, can you think of an ordinary floater's expectations for you?</p>
<p>(2) Shadow</p>
<p>There is no moon tonight, nor are there any stars. The air is as muggy as if it were in a steamer. I can't see any light, and I can't see my shadow.</p>
<p>The one who cares most about me has always been my shadow. No matter what kind of bad environment I am in, or when I am in the poorest time, all my friends leave me, and my shadow still steals a little time to come and visit me, and also brings a ray of light. I think if there is no one in the world who understands me anymore, I will put myself in the realm of silence, let myself be alone, and let the shadow comfort myself.</p>
<p>When I was forced by life to embark on my journey, I also brought a lot of enthusiasm and the heart of a wild child. The road got farther and farther, I saw more liars, and guys who hung sheep's heads and sold dog meat also came to rob me, robbing me of everything I had, and also piercing my heart. In this way, I had to imprison myself in silence again, letting time erode myself. I have not yet embarked on the road contrary to the wishes I had allowed myself at the time, and it is worth thanking the sea and my shadow for constantly stimulating me.</p>
<p>Summer nights are depressing, and everything in the world seems to have become the most cruel thing, and these hypocritical guys only attack some people who have an unfortunate fate and bully them wantonly. In this way, I was injured and hid in an inconspicuous corner, using my own hope to apply to that terrible wound.</p>
<p>——When will I be able to see my shadow?</p>
<p>Interesting; around ten o'clock, the whole village is very quiet. Looking down, only the sun is shining, quietly, without any sound; if there is, it is the crowing of the rooster, which makes it even quieter. The long crowing of the village rooster at noon sounds as if it is lengthening the days. In the loneliness, I sometimes suspect: could it be that the owners are all busy and have left only the rooster to watch the house?</p>
<p>There are only two times when the mountain village is relatively noisy, one is in the afternoon, when the setting sun is about to pass over the mountain, the village women will shout for their children at this time, and smoke will drift out of the roofs. Camels, donkeys, and people are all walking home; naturally, there will be some noise. The other is in the morning. The villagers know that the plan for the day lies in the morning, and they are busy with sound and color, which is also at this time: vegetable sellers go to catch the early market, and young men lead donkeys to the town seven or eight miles away from the mountain to attract tourists: everyone starts with a hope, and being busy in this kind of air is definitely with sound and color.</p>

<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>——Mountain Residence Miscellany</p>
<p>Although the residence is said to be on the mountain, it is actually not very high; it is not for the sake of escaping the summer heat that I went up the mountain. Not to mention that the houses in high places are expensive, I just feel that there is no need to live so high; cooking for myself, it is inconvenient to go up and down the mountain to buy some scallions and garlic.</p>
<p>Because the residence is not high, the farmhouses in the foothills have become my neighbors. A person who is used to living in the city is living in a foreign village again: the scenery is different from my hometown, and it is very different from the city. For example, in the morning, listening to the donkey's bray, the crows' cawing, and the tinkling of the camel bells going up and down the mountain in the hazy mist, is something I would never dream of in my hometown; in the city, there is still the cawing of crows, but it is difficult to experience the others. In this respect, living on the mountainside is really better than living in a higher place: this is the interest I have only felt after living here for a long time, and I really didn't think of it at first.</p>
<p>There are many mosquitoes in the mountain residence, and many mosquitoes prompt me to go to bed early; going to bed early and getting up early is the only way to live up to the mountain residence. In fact, it is a pity to live on the mountain without experiencing the morning on the mountain. Farmers are mostly busy in the morning, and they are really busy: selling vegetables to attract people to visit the mountains in the town eight miles away: everyone starts with a hope, and being busy in this kind of air is indeed with sound and color.</p>
<p>There is a lot of fog in the mountain mornings, fortunately, it is not very thick, just a layer of gauze, gently covering the houses and trees, and it dissipates when the sun shines on it. Busy people are busy in the fog, showing that what is busy is the sound. The heavy burdens make a creaking sound when pressed on the shoulders, and in the fog, you can only hear the sound and not see the person; when the sound gets louder and farther away, I know that a villager has picked a hope far away. The groaning sound of the donkey driver is with a bit of urging taste, perhaps because the animals are greedy for the wild grass with dew on the roadside. After the urging sound whips away the light fog, the tinkling of the camel bells is much clearer. Let the camel bells drink the song of confidence and move forward step by step, the mountain journey in the morning is not lonely with you on the road; I often say this to the camels in my heart. Really, the camel bells in the morning air will arouse people's confidence and optimism.</p>
<p>Several families in the village know that I and two friends will go to the town to buy vegetables in the morning, and as soon as it is light, they will lead the donkeys to my door. At first, they followed the donkeys, but later, when they got used to it, they simply handed the donkeys over to us.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>us. When we don't go to town, there will be two or three donkeys tied to the black jujube tree at the door. A friend often says: "Get up, you hear the donkeys kicking the wall again." In fact, it is still very early, and what you see when you push open the window is just fog, it is still early; when the fog is slightly thinner, we ride donkeys around the mountain; it is inconvenient to ride donkeys backwards in the fog, otherwise it might be more interesting. In fact, saying that we ride donkeys around the mountain is more like we are herding donkeys for others: we let the donkeys eat grass and walk; when someone comes to catch up from behind, we pull the reins and let the person in front pass by.</p>
<p>This kind of exercise has made our bodies stronger, and it is still worth living in the mountains; the reason is that we get up early. It is really meaningless to live on the mountain if you get up late; if you don't get up until nine or ten o'clock, will you not be bored to death listening to the lonely long crowing of the village rooster?</p>

<p>— Original work by Kato Takeo, translated by Wan Shi</p>
<p>When I was a teacher in an elementary school, one day, in the third-grade classroom, I was lecturing on a lesson in self-cultivation. I forgot what motive I had, but I asked the students: "Everyone! What is in your belly? Do you know?"</p>
<p>When the children were asked, they all raised their hands and answered in unison: "I know! I know!"</p>
<p>One said: "There is rice in the belly." One said: "There is a stomach in the belly." One said: "There are intestines in the belly."</p>
<p>All the children in the classroom gave this kind of answer, and their knowledge was probably limited to this.</p>
<p>So I asked again: "Besides what you have answered, what else is in the belly? Is there anyone who knows?"</p>
<p>None of the children raised their hands to my question. At this moment, in the girls' section, there was a female student named Chuanzi, with a red ribbon tied to her head, and a look of triumph appeared on her face; as if to say that no one could know this question, only she alone could know.</p>
<p>Seeing her expression, I said to her: "Chuanzi, if you know, tell us."</p>
<p>Chuanzi stood up, slightly tilting her head, looking towards me. I saw her cheeks moving slightly, as if she was saying something, but her face was blushing. I didn't hear a word of what she was saying, so I said to her: "I didn't hear you, please say it again!"</p>
<p>Chuanzi's cheeks moved slightly again, and this time, her face was blushing even more; but I still didn't hear her speak, so I said to her again: "Please speak louder."</p>
<p>Chuanzi seemed to have mustered her last bit of courage and said in a murmur: "This... there is a child in the belly!"</p>
<p>When I heard her words, I couldn't help but say: "There is a child in the belly?"</p>
<p>After listening, I smiled slightly. Because of my smile, Chuanzi's face was blushing even more, and even her ears were as red as if they were on fire. She immediately fell into the laughter of the children and became the focus of their eyes. Seeing Chuanzi's expression at this moment, I realized the shyness of a woman, and at the same time, I didn't see her as a girl, but only saw her purity; no! It can be said to be solemn!</p>
<p>Today, on the tram, I accidentally saw a young woman holding a child; because of this young woman, I was reminded of this little story from more than ten years ago. I think Chuanzi must have one or two children now, right? The words she was waiting for back then will now prove their truth in person, right?</p>
<p>Thinking like this, I felt an indescribable joy in my chest.</p>

<p>The Youth Drama Society attached to the Youth Association was founded by Mr. Tao Dan, Shi Bin, and Shi Chi, three famous figures in Shanghai's Huaguang Foreign Firm, the News and Education circles.

It is said that special singing and drama programs will be broadcast on major radio stations in the city soon, and stage performances will be held in major theaters. The society is currently recruiting male and female members for rehearsals of new plays. Anyone who aspires to love music and drama can join the society. A prospectus is available. For mail requests, please attach two cents for postage (blank letters will not be answered). Contact address: Tao Dan, No. 287-291 Guangdong Road, or Shi Chi, No. 41, Lane 685, Gordon Road.

<h3 id="e220">"Little Angel" Descends to Earth <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Since Wang Renmei starred in "Song of the Fisherman" at Lianhua Company, there have been no new works released. The people of the country have been eagerly awaiting them, and the descent of "Little Angel" is indeed great news. The original work of "Little Angel" was the first choice for the Jiangsu Provincial Government's education solicitation, written by Jiang Xingde, and written and directed by Wu Yonggang. The plot describes a poor family. The father is on a distant expedition to the country, the grandmother works hard, the mother sews for meager profits, and the daughter cannot attend school due to poverty. The only son is able to study with hard-earned money. However, every member of the family has their own occupation, and family harmony is revealed. Compared to their neighbors who are well-fed and have no fun, the difference is immeasurable. The whole play focuses on the two children, indicating the importance of family education. The richness of emotions can be said to have reached its peak, so the drama's emotional power is extremely great. At the climax of the whole play, the sister saves her brother, sacrificing her own blood. At that time, the air is tense, and the audience is almost breathless and motionless. The emotions are high and unstoppable. The director's skill is amazing. Actors such as Lin Chuchu, Li Junpan, and Tang Tianxiu are all excellent. Hong Weilie's photography and Xu Ke's setting each have their extraordinary achievements. Looking at the whole play, it is impeccable and is indeed an extraordinary work in the Chinese film industry in recent years. The film will be screened in theaters throughout the city recently.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Jincheng Sets Today as Disaster Relief Day <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>All Business Income is Used for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>For the past two months, newspapers have been filled with large-scale news about floods in various places. The extent of the disaster area and the severity of the damage can be said to be unprecedented. The tragic scenes are shocking and unbearable to read. As citizens of China, we should all rise up together and find ways to save the suffering people. For this reason, the Jincheng Grand Theater has set today (Thursday) as Disaster Relief Day. It has specially obtained the consent of Lianhua Film Company and Diantong Company to provide the films "New Woman," "The Highway," and "Peach and Plum Calamity" for free screening in the theater, with one film being shown per showing. All business income for the day, without deducting expenses, will be used for disaster relief. Their enthusiasm for "doing good and giving alms" is worthy of our emulation. I hope all Shanghai movie fans will hurry to participate, because it doesn't cost much (the price remains the same, without increasing). Not only will it benefit the victims, but you can also comfortably watch a two-hour movie in a cool theater. Why not do it? One more thing you should pay attention to is that it's only for today.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Bright Moon Society to Perform "Wild Rose" <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>After performing at the Xinguang Grand Theater last month, the Bright Moon Opera Society is now actively preparing and will stage the large-scale song and dance drama "Wild Rose," which caused a sensation in Shanghai two years ago, at the Central Grand Theater on Six Malu in the city, starting on the 9th of this month. It is reported that the society will be invited to theaters in other cities after this performance. After this performance at the Central Grand Theater, it is feared that they will not be able to meet with the people of Shanghai again in the shortest period of time. Those who love singing and dancing should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Diantong Scenery Line <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The Diantong Propaganda Department recently received hundreds of exchange certificates for preview tickets for Diantong's new film "Goddess of Freedom" from readers of "Women's Life." However, because the preview date of the film has not yet been determined, the preview tickets have not yet been printed and distributed. As for when the preview will be, readers of "Women's Life" are requested to refer to the public screening advertisement for "Goddess of Freedom."</p>
<p>Since the Diantong Pictorial Society announced the prize search, it has received a mountain of application letters. In addition to sending specialists to classify, register, and create cards, many people have been asked to help. All those who guessed correctly will receive their prizes after the clearing procedures are completed. However, many winners of the first and second prize searches have not yet attached postage stamps. Please send them as soon as possible to avoid further delay.</p>
<p>The Diantong Singing Team is enthusiastically singing the theme song of "Goddess of Freedom." If you want to write to the Diantong Propaganda Department to request the sheet music, please note the following points: (1) Write your address clearly, (2) Attach sufficient postage, (3) The propaganda department may be busy with letters and cannot reply immediately. We hope the audience will forgive us.</p>
<p>Diantong child star Ren Ke has extraordinary hearing and intelligence. Whenever a photographer takes pictures of him, he can automatically express various poses. There are also many such natural expressions in "Goddess of Freedom."</p>
<p>"City Scenery" set off at eight o'clock this morning to shoot on location. Director Yuan Muzhi got up early and urged the actors to go to the dressing room to make up. Gu Menghu received a filming notice earlier and was afraid that he would not be able to arrive in time tomorrow morning, so he came to Diantong the night before and stayed in Muzhi's room. After everyone finished dressing up and had breakfast, a group of people set off for their destination in the faint morning light.</p>
