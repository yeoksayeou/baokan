<h3 id="c21">兩起闔家自殺案件 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 龍</p>
<p>上月三十一日。法租界麥琪路天津人岳霖。曾發生闔家八口服毒自殺慘案。因岳霖二次自殺不遂。捕房控以敎唆自殺罪。詎料未及旬日。法租界愛多亞路某遊戲塲。又發生張月鑫闔家六口。自該塲第六層塔樓墮下自殺的慘劇。其爲狀之慘眞是見者傷心聞者酸鼻。其自殺的原因。據死者遺書。也是爲了經濟的壓迫。以素封之家。而竟至窮無立錐。撫今思昔。覺得已毫無生的樂趣。於是一門三代遂同歸於盡。在此社會經濟極度緊張之下。有此自殺環境的人。我想不知凡幾。他們以爲與其惡生。不若惡死到也乾脆。此種情形實開我國未有的紀錄。</p>
<p>因爲受不了經濟壓迫的慘痛而自殺的。在報紙上天天都有發現。或者一日竟有數起。但八口六口闔家的自殺在以前尙屬罕聞。不料最近數日之間。竟然述續發生兩起。此種情形非一人一家的不幸。實社會國家之大不幸也。岳霖的自殺慘劇。捕房控以敎唆自殺罪。確眞岳霖太殘忍了。太慘酷了。自己自殺不算。還敎他妻子兒女闔家自殺。自殺的人數計有八口之多。然試思岳霖爲什麼要自殺？是受了經濟壓迫。爲什麽要妻子兒女一同自殺？天然岳霖自己不能生活。妻子兒女詎能生活。不若闔家自殺爲愈。苟其岳霖尙有生活的能力。救濟的出路决不忍出此下策。</p>
<p>刑法的意義不外兩種。一是懲戒本人犯罪行爲。使其以後不再犯罪。二是儆吿未犯罪者。使他們不至亦犯同樣的罪惡。這原是立法的本意。但是人到了山窮水盡的境地。自殺固死不自殺亦必餓死。不若自殺的來得乾脆潔淨。人若到此地步任何嚴刑峻法都不能動其毫末。也决不會恐怕當局將判以敎咬自殺而便不自殺。故在這種情形之下法津的效力實等於其文。</p>
<p>人人要做善良的國民。人人要做安分守己的老百姓。但到日暮途窮之際。祇有出路兩條。其强者則良心一橫鋌而走險。綁票盜匪漢奸都無不可去幹。其弱者不是吳市吹簫。便去做消極自殺的勾當。現在我國的經濟沒落。已到了最後的階段。農村破產都市荒凉。卽如近日端節前後。銀行錢莊公司之停歇者。不知幾何家。於此愁雲慘霧中。犧牲者也不知幾何人。社會貧困的深刻化到此地步。已無可諱言也不必諱言了。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）財部近來故意减少購銀、國會銀派議員竟毫無舉動、今日頗使觀察者不明眞相、向來財部之購銀計劃如稍放鬆、銀派議員卽提出猛烈之動議、以強制財長毛根韜加緊購買、是以最近銀派之毫無反響、益以衆議員戴斯及馬丁之聲明、更足令人對於銀派之態度發生疑問、此間消息靈通者咸以爲財部之緩進白銀、係有下列二種原因、</p>
<p>（一）欲保持平衡基金、不加動用、以準備歐洲金本位集團崩壞之時、可調劑美元匯價之劇變、</p>
<p>（二）欲使中國及其他曾受購銀政策不良影響之圃家得稍緩和局勢、俾可各自整理其幣制政策</p>
<p>今日民主黨參議員華爾許提出一案、主張授權財部劃分幣制用銀及商業用銀之範圍、是爲國會中唯一表示對於白銀之興趣者、華氏謂該案之目的係欲防止商業用銀價格之變動、同時財長毛根韜已將去年八月十七日所定外國銀幣輸入領照條例修正、規定惟有紐約聯邦準備銀行或政府代表始得無照輸入銀幣但美國銀幣則仍得無照輸入、領照人並須證明輸入之銀幣係償付合法之債務、且已得外國政府之許可、或爲收藏家所特別珍重者云、</p>
<p>參議員華爾許之提案對於美國之白銀政策將無大關係、因該案並不限制銀塊輸入也、幣制專家以爲禁止外國銀幣輸入、在國際間亦無足重輕、蓋銀幣儘可鎔成銀塊、然後輸入、且此法早已實行矣、據稱禁止銀幣輸入之最大價値、即爲對於禁止銀幣輸出之國家頗能收合作之助力云、（五日國民電）</p>

<p>長江航路同盟、起初原定七家、卽太古·怡和·招商·寗紹·三北·日淸外、美商捷江公司、亦要求加入、而已爲各輪公司所容納、但捷江航業、注重長江上游、滬漢一途、營業甚微、故于長江公攤聲明不再加入、故今日公定爲六家同盟云、</p>
<p>簽訂公約</p>
<p>六公司爲公攤問題、召集會議、討論此事、經過四五月之久、各公司以營業競爭過甚、水脚一落萬丈、挽救之策、唯有共同一致、方能泯除此濫跌運率·狂放同佣·之積弊·故議定六公司用公開方法、將長江營業、實行公攤、以有餘補不足、惟因船多、經數度調查、始將六公司現行船舶噸位等查明、然後根據各公司所有輪船、擬定公攤合同、直至本月五日、由六公司代表、正式簽定公約、</p>
<p>辦法概況</p>
<p>六公司同盟辦法、係將各公司現行江輪、由騐　决定、總噸數减去非裝貨噸、確定其凈噸數、將各公司水脚收入、除去折扣及手續費、以凈收數作爲公定費率、以每船每次凈運費、裝載地位、公定費率爲標準、例如每輪每次裝載地位、比凈噸數百分之五十爲少、則加裝載地位百分之五十、再以公定費率乘之、而得公攤分數、以求該公司應得該輪之水腳費、如每輪每次裝載地位、比凈噸數百分之五十爲多、則加非裝儎地位之百分五十、再以公定費率乘之、而得公攤之分數、以求該公司應得該輪之水脚數、簡單言之、例如一千噸輪、裝貨以五百噸爲準、則多裝須攤出、如不滿五百噸者、乃由多運之輪攤補之、如此辦法、則長江船永無爭攬多運之克矣、</p>
<p>試辦六月</p>
<p>公約簽定後、六公司議定、自七月一日起實行、施行期暫定六個月、如果辦有成效、六公司一致贊同繼續、則有效期間、可以繼續延長、</p>

<p>張元濟詞</p>
<p>東方圖書館復興委員會主席張元濟致詞如下、博德斯總領事先生曁諸位來賓、今天東方圖書館承法國公益慈善會捐贈名貴書籍一千餘種、並承法國駐上海總領事博德斯先生代表致詞、不佞謹以東方圖書館復興委員會主席資格、代表接受、並謹致感佩之意、我們大家想都知道、中西文化的開始溝通、雖然很早、但到十七世紀以來、才比較有系統的交換、在這中西文化溝通的過程中、雖然有各國學者做我們的中介、但我們可以斷言、此種工作、要以法國耶蘇會的學者和現代法國的漢學家爲最有功、這許多法國學者、一面把西洋的科學和基督敎傳到中國、同時亦把中國人的政治哲學、人倫道德、農業技術、和美術工藝等傳入歐洲、因此十八世紀以來、歐洲的思想和藝術、都受過中國文化的影饗、法國洛可可派的藝術家服爾德和百科全書一派的政治思想家、克斯內一派的經濟思想家、就都是中西文化融和之後的產物、現代法國深通中國文化的學者很多、其最著者如沙畹和伯希和諸先生、尤値得我們敬佩、沙畹先生在一十餘年前、鄙人游歷歐洲時、曾往奉訪暢談、伯希和先生則今日列席、給我們很有價値的演講、尤其是十二分的榮幸、所以溝通中西文化、要以法國人爲最努力、使得中西文化互相發生影響、亦要以法國人爲最有功、今天法國公益慈善會捐贈書籍給東方圖書館、極足表示法國國民對於中西文化的交換繼續的努力、不佞覺得不但東方圖書館復興委員會應該感佩我們法國的朋友、就是我們中國人、似乎亦應該感佩近代法國學者努力宣揚中國的文化、我們今天爲表示我們的謝意起見、特謹回贈商務印書館最近出版的四庫全書珍本一部、作爲中法文化繼續交換的一個紀念、鄙人謹代表東方圖書館復興委員會謝謝此次慨捐大示名貴圖書的法國公益慈善會、和年來爲東方圖書館致力極多使此次贈書得以實現的東方圖書館復興委員會委員法國李榮先生、以及今日主持贈與儀式之博德斯總領事先生、同時並謝謝全體來賓、</p>
<p>汪院長詞</p>
<p>汪院長代表褚秘書長民誼演詞、我國東方圖書館雖爲民問私立、然所收圖書、最爲美備、在我國東南各省公私藏書之所、向未有能及之者、一旦橫被鋒鏑、實爲我國文化上莫大之損失、今該館重加搜集、雖未能即復舊觀、然因各方面之贊助、仍不失爲上海貯藏圖書之寳庫、最近承法國公益慈善會捐贈書籍一千餘種、於本月舉行贈受典禮、幷公開展覽、本人承行政院注院長之命、代表參加於拜領我友邦人士盛意之餘、益增感慨、惟念在歐戰之際、比國魯文地方、有一大圖書館罹於兵火、後經修復、各國皆競贈圖籍、不數載仍蔚然成爲大觀、誠以文化爲推進人類之工具、而圖書又實爲文化所寄托、各文明國家無不重視之、故關於此類事業、多願出爲贊助、我東方岡書館今日接受我友邦人士盛意、頓增無數文明國家專門學者之著作、我人知其他友邦人士必更有抱同一之感情、而繼起贊助者、此又我人徵諸魯文圖書館之往事、而可予以確信者也、故本人常陳謝法國公益慈善會之際、幷述其感想如此、</p>
<p>吳李演說</p>
<p>續吳市長代表洪秘書演說、略謂今天吳市長因事不能親自參加、由兄弟代表、東方圖書館在未摧毀之前、是中國很富的財產、已燬之後、經復興委員會之努力、現承法國公益慈善會捐贈有價備之書籍、而經漢學家伯希和先生之選採、東方圖書館得此、上海市財富上又添了許多、更可注意的、這不僅是滿進中西文化、還有很深的感情表現的、兄弟敬代表市長向友邦致謝、並對東方圖書館復興委員會之努力表示感佩、李石曾氏演說、略謂、今天剛從北平到上海、忽促參加、覺得有些感想、我們人類有兩種精神、一種是不幸的鬭爭、種是互助合作、今天的集會是完全表現互助合作、而且不是局部的表現、是綜合人類的很大的表演、人類不幸的鬭爭、將來一定隨互助合作精神之發展而改變、今天的會、是表現中法兩國文化互助文化合作、此種表現很可樂觀、東方圖書館豐受犧牲、但今天的互助勝過犧牲云、</p>

<h3 id="c138">論用俗語 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 行之</p>
<p>白話文學中雖也有用國語寫與用地方語寫的論爭，但揷用俗語是免不了的事，所以在白話文學裏，對於用俗語，是無須提及了。</p>
<p>但是奇怪的在古文學裏，也儘有用俗語的，從此我們可以知道不但白話文中用俗語是不足怪，即是在文言文中用俗語也是極通常的。</p>
<p>這其中即是用俗語正爲文學的因素，用了俗語是可以使文學生色的，不能表現得充分時，必須用俗語乃能達出作者的意見，使所要描寫的形態並無輕重大小之分。</p>
<p>唯有一般淺薄的文匠，才覺得用了俗語要使文傷典雅，所以在古來的文家中，惟大手筆才得使用俗語，才知使用俗語的好處，餘者楚够不上這個資格了。</p>
<p>古來散文中以史記漢書著稱，不知史記正參用了許多俗語，漢書人稱爲簡鍊　茂，也正因爲活用當時民衆語言的緣故。例如史記的陳涉世家裏，有：</p>
<p>「夥頥！涉之爲王沉沉者」！（者字古音如睹）</p>
<p>這句子正是幕寫種田朋友的神氣，「顆頥」是驚羨的俗語。又如周昌傳裏寫一個口吃的周昌諫高祖道：</p>
<p>「臣口不能言，然臣期—期知其不可。陛下欲廢太子，臣期！期不奉詔。」</p>
<p>這也是極力摹仿說俗語的樣子。</p>
<p>至於漢書，像外戚傳一篇，其中司隸解光奏彈趙飛燕姊妹的長文，所引審問宮婢宦官的口供，簡直全是用俗語所寫成的。所以覺得，非常簡樸。因篇幅太長，不便引錄在這裏。</p>
<p>古詩歌中用俗語的也很多。杜甫稱爲詩聖，是中國數一數二的大詩入，但他用俗語的地方却不少。例如送蔡希魯一詩裏：</p>
<p>「馬頭令匼匝，馳背錦模糊」。</p>
<p>「匼匝」，（密匝的意思）「模糊」，都是俗語。</p>
<p>又杜詩喜用「喫」與「箇」字，謂食爲喫，數物以箇，不即是俗語嗎？例如「樓頭喫酒樓下臥」「但使殘年飽喫飯」「梅實許同朱老喫」「臨岐意頗切，對洒不能喫」以及如「峽口驚猿聞「筒」，「兩筒黃騙鳴翠柳」「却達井欄添筒箇」都是。</p>
<p>至如贈畢四曜及早秋苦熱二詩，差不多可說全首是用俗語寫成的。杜之偉大處，也可說就在於此。</p>
<p>其他如六朝時的應璩，左思，程曉等，都是民衆化的白話詩人，他們最喜歡用俗語的。現舉程曉的嘲熱客一首爲例：</p>
<p>「平生三伏時，道路無行車。閉門避暑臥，出入不相過。今世　　子，　熱到人家。主人聞客來，蹙顰奈此何！謂當起行去，安坐正跘跨，所說無一急，嗜啥一何多？疲倦向之久，甫問」君極那」？搖屆髀中痛，流汗正滂沱。莫謂爲小事，亦是一大瑕。傳戒睹高明，熱行宜見呵！」</p>
<p>這詩中的「　　」「跘跨」「嗜啥」「極那」，都是俗語，足見古來詩人多有應用的。他如」舉頭望明月，低頭思故鄉」，「江水三千里，家書十二行；行行無別語，只道早還鄉」。以及「牀頭一壺酒」之類，全行俗語，明白如話，是可知俗語本無傷於雅，而且能助文氣之活發與流暢的。</p>
<h3 id="c139">「兒童文學」 <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 辜定</p>
<p>今年是兒童年。「兒童文學」這名稱也隨着這年的開始特別提了出來。適應這個要求的，是各書業的兒童雜誌的增多，以及爭着出版兒童文庫之類。就對於兒童這方面說起來，這當然也算是很好的現象。</p>
<p>中國大多數的兒童，向來就是在「非文化」的空氣中生活着，幾本枯燥的書，有的還加上一條靑竹板子，於是差不多都被敎成一臉死氣的「少年老成」了。記得我們從前還是兒童的時代，無論在家庭或在學校，要看看文學作品之類是絕對不准的。我有些朋友，躱在黑被窩裏點一炷香看西遊記之類把眼睛差不多看瞎了。這種令人戰慄的過去，總算被流去的時光永遠淹沒：到現在該要進步好多了吧？可是在「太白」上讀了白芬先生的一篇文章，說是「敎聰明孩子也難」！據說那作先生的爲得使學生們對於所敎的那一課得到實感，就帶他們到寳山路去看一看，但是第二天，那作父親的跑來向先生責斥道：不行！大意是這樣。然而這也可想見，現在的兒童，也還並不見得比我們那時好了多少！</p>
<p>然而今年的兒童，總也算斗然走了幸運；從前老是在父兄輩睜睜的眼珠之下，呌躱在背後的，現在忽然一下被抱在大庭廣衆之前了。於是不免引起大家指點着這小嘴小臉兒評論一番，終之說道：兒童也應該有文學。好的，我也極願意舉起雙手，因爲我特別想起了從前我的那些小朋友們的眼睛。其實這問題早就應該大聲急呼的了。</p>
<p>說起「兒童文學」，照中國人向來對於問題的老例，恐怕有些人已經在抓耳皺眉的說：今年又去了半年了呵！其實問題並不這樣簡單，這决不是應景兒的什麽「賦得兒童」之類可以了事，而是嚴肅的堅苦工作。凡是眞正埋頭於文化，眞正爲下一代人着想的人們，應該具着這樣的决心，一年，兩年，十年，百年，……開出小花，還要牠開出大花，繁盛，普遍。</p>
<p>爲適合於兒童的口味，創作當然重要；但我們在目前尤其重要的是培養作者。要切實，豐富，只有向世界的名著去「學習」。翻譯就顯得更迫切了。所以外國的作品，應該多多的介紹進來。同時我們應該這樣的確信：中國的「兒童文學」，在目前應該是堅苦的，一方面是培養，一方面是創造的時代。</p>

<p>— 周楞</p>
<p>那少婦見大家都在數說她，沒有一個肯給她以同情和寬容，忍不住書急得高聲大叫起來了。</p>
<p>「天地良心！我哪裏是什麼强盜的窩底！這個包裏我　　是藏在肚皮上的，　盜大概當我是大肚皮，所以就不留心了。」</p>
<p>這話使艙中人都開然大笑起來，只有巽卿先生沒有笑意，他不住摸着鬍鬚，有時順便把乎伸上去撫摩着右頰。</p>
<p>德貴奶奶笑了一會，却又冷冷的說起話來。</p>
<p>『哼！這種話，就是三歲孩子也騙不過。强盜的眼光多麼厲害，剛纔我頭上的一叔金押變，差不多有一大半埋在頭髮裏，也會給他們搜了去，何况是這樣大的一個包裹，哪裏會瞞得過他們』？</p>
<p>巽卿先生高高揚起一隻手來，作了個老吏斷獄的姿勢說：</p>
<p>『好了，這些已經足够證明她是强盜的窩底了。還有一樣可疑的是，她的面孔很陌生，我在本地住了這多年，好像總沒有見通她，你們裏面可有認識她的嗎』？</p>
<p>艙中人十有八九在搖頭，不曾搖頭的只有柳滄水東生和阿保三個。他們也並不認識那少婦，只是有些不滿巽卿先生那盛氣凌人的態度。不過他們都明白自己的地位很低微，决不是有赤練蛇之名的巽卿先生的對手，所以雖然覺得那少婦可憐，也不敢開口說什麽。</p>
<p>那少婦似乎被艙中冷酷的空氣逼迫得難受，開始嚶嚶的啜泣起來了。忽然她堅决地立起身來，抽抽咽咽的向衆人說：</p>
<p>『諸位都是明白人，我要是强盜的窩底，怎麽會不跟着强盜一起走？這位先生明明是有心陷害我。我也不認識他是誰，不過方纔在黑暗裏，他曾動手摸……摸我的，……』</p>
<p>『摸你的什麼』？吳鶴軒充滿了興趣的狡猾地問，一壁狠狼的盯了巽卿先生一眼。</p>
<p>『摸我的奶』！那少婦紅着臉繼續說：『是我不該打了他一記耳光，想不到他竟記了恨，現在反而咬我一口，硬說我是什麽强盜的窩底』！</p>
<p>『哼哼』！吳鶴軒忍不住接連向巽卿先生冷笑了兩聲，他心裏暗暗痛快，覺得巽卿先生那假道學的面具，現在可完全扯破了。艙中人的眼光也都愕然的注親到了巽卿先生臉上，好像都有些詫異這樣一個嚴正古板的人，也會在暗地裏作虧心事一般。</p>
<h3 id="c141">禮 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>照例傍晚時候，我鎖了小學校的房門，帶起鑰匙回家去吃飯。我的家，是在仲禹的小家庭裏一單間，承他夫妻的情，讓我這孤身人和他們一起吃飯。</p>
<p>終日裏，被裏在一團亂絲裏處理事情的我，只有在這時候得到寗靜。我最高興倚在那竹靠背椅上，一邊聽自己心跳，一邊聽年靑夫婦的嘩笑。</p>
<p>今天是特別早，我特地回去吿訴一聲，怕那女人心急，便是仲禹陪着銀行的視察員進了城，也許一天不回頭。我走時，天空還餘留着半個落日。</p>
<p>到了家，那棕黃色的茅草頂子，使人第一眼便感到溫馨。進門時，老黃狗睡夢中搖着尾巴在歡迎。四合房襯出院子是四方形，很齊整，一列大向日葵擺着大頭，那色調和白牆調和極了。</p>
<p>聽一聽，彷彿正房裏有人在講話。我不便進去打攪，便把在唇邊的話嚥下去，徑直走到自己的房裏，房內陰陰地非常凉爽。</p>
<p>我便坐在有靠背的竹椅上，信。吹着哨子，謝謝我那小房東，她已經給我預備了一大瓶冷開水。我便舉起瓶子，向喉嚨裏一氣倒下去。</p>
<p>我又吹着哨子：我閉上了眼睛……</p>
<p>「李先生，你什麽時候回來的？……」</p>
<p>天黑了，仲禹夫人進來送一盞媒油燈，她大聲喊起來，我從朦朧中醒了。</p>
<p>「怎麽弄的」。我說笑着，「剛坐下就睡着……」</p>
<p>我立起身，向他告訴了仲禹進城的事。她聽了很漠然，一分鐘後，她吐了一口吐沫，把兩隻大圓眼睛直視着我，說道「你等一等，我有事求你…」</p>
<p>藍布袍出去了，烏髮在頭上跳動着。</p>
<p>我臉上浮起微笑。一忽兒，我看見那女人提着一竹籃肉紅的雞蛋走進來，她的表情很鄭靈。</p>
<p>「送禮嗎？」我由不得便開玩笑了。「似乎老賢姪還沒有—不太早一些嗎？」</p>
<p>她狠狠地瞪我一眼，薔薇紅飛上雙腮。頭低下了，手按着隆起的腹部。自從她有孕以來，她便不肯出門，同時也不敢去見生人，小學校中她是擔任一班課的，這時也只好給了他的丈夫。只有我這他們唯一的芳隣，時常拿這事情來取笑。</p>
<p>「說正經事呢，」她薄嗔着：「這是一個我的老親戚送你的，說是你們已經查了貸欵的田，她想求求你，在欵條上加個三二萬，暫時全按頭等算…」</p>
<p>「這個！」我把笑臉收起來。「這個不易辦」。</p>
<p>我想，沒有「公正」是難以處置二萬元以上的欵子的，賄賂雖然公行，但在才萌芽的合作社裏斷然不允許他存在。雖然，我爲感情，不能期白的對她說明，（其實她也何嘗不明白），所以，我只能這樣講出來：</p>
<p>「這禮物呢，請你還她去，呌她把名字開下來，我可以查查有沒有誤報的……」</p>
<p>仲禹夫人聽了我這「官話」，便信實了爲免除她起誤會，和事情的堅持。我只好改變空氣，又打起哈哈來：「可是，你的紅蛋我是要吃的。」</p>
<p>快活的吃畢夜飯，我便到平民夜校去上課。</p>
<h3 id="c142">老女 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 聖時</p>
<p>每年的春天，</p>
<p>留下一聲嘆息。</p>
<p>無可訴說的抑怨裏，</p>
<p>看嫩綠色的靑春逝去。</p>
<p>兩頰翻出枯黯的蠟黃，</p>
<p>唇邊再拈不起一朶笑了。</p>
<p>那些豐美的曲線，</p>
<p>已失了輕勻。</p>
<p>沉在無邊的寂寞裏，</p>
<p>一顆幽怨的心。</p>
<h3 id="c143">老羊 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>他姓梁，懦善的氣質像一頭羊，我們同伴問全喚他——老羊。</p>
<p>老羊是我們同伴間很可憐的一個。</p>
<p>膽怯，善感的神經質，他的血液裏永遠流着悲苦與寂寞的病茵。</p>
<p>老是向我們說野話，白天裏做着怪夢，始終抱着消極，好多次吿訴我們總是說：</p>
<p>—一個人這樣活下去，再也活不下了，我每個時辰裏問自己，還有什麽理由要活下去？有月亮的夜上，問月亮，默然悵望着一天搖搖欲　的星星，我想自家的生命也正懸在毫無憑依的半空裏。</p>
<p>我們常同情的勸慰他，然而老羊是勸不好的，在無可奈何的情境下，我們爲他太息着：</p>
<p>—老羊的病是不會好的呵！</p>
<p>幾年前，他肺病到第二期，還是不知保養身體，他的一位同鄉吿訴我們：老羊肺病厲害時候，每天吐一大堆血，因爲他是家裏的獨養子，父親幼年就死了，母親最後的希望就在他身上，然而老羊在正嚴重的肺病期間，還是天天打算尋死，母親看着他一大堆的血，抱住他輕瘦得不成樣的身體，呌着：</p>
<p>—兒呵！你不要吐吧？不要再吐吧！</p>
<p>老眼珠裏一包淚水，一酸，跌落出來了。</p>
<p>母親化了整千的醫費給他療治，肺病終於在長期的休養中慢慢好起來了。</p>
<p>老羊在士九歲那年，由家庭作主給他成了婚。</p>
<p>他不能滿意這位從小在鄕村裏過生活的粗笨的新夫人。</p>
<p>直到他在×中學跟我們成爲知己同學時，他才那麽告訴我們：</p>
<p>—我不忍違反母親爲我結婚的心意，然而到舉行婚禮這天，我打算逃出來，后來被家裏人看破了我的秘密，逃不成，結婚後第七日，我决心同母親吿別了上城來升學了。</p>
<p>—吿訴你們，這女人我沒承認過，七天七晚沒跟他談任何一句話，她粗笨傻氣，不識一個字，一副醜惡的行態，我不能爲自己解釋有什麽理由要愛那麼一位討厭的女人。</p>
<p>他每次一談到自家這問題，一顆心就頽傷下來，一些無法解排的傷心全一起襲住他。</p>
<p>我們爲他解釋，天下沒一件不得解開的事，不能結合的夫婦，可以離婚，我們知道他也一定想過的，只是覺到另外一方而有種種爲難處，就自己作罷了。</p>
<p>他以抑鬱的眼珠子看人生，然而他是個感情衝溢的年靑人，常把過敏的神經想，向那麽渺茫放肆的天邊想去，對於人生他沒有一點把掘，地只咀咒這紛擾的社會，他覺到生活沒有希望，沒有着落，在一個摸不到一點頭路的世界裏；頽傷消沉了。</p>
<p>老羊的病症是不會好的，他是一瓶漏完了氣的燒酒。</p>
<p>人一到傷心之至極的境地，心理走入病態了。我們知道他在學校裏有位想愛而不敢愛的女同學，然而他天天暗地裏罵她們虛榮，切齒地罵女子的心最毒，吿訴我們願意上荒凉的山寺裏做和尙去。</p>
<p>每個黃昏上，跟他一扯談，感情就興奮得不可收拾，跟我們談着會突然地呌出來，額上滲冒出一層汗珠，一張平時褐黃的臉脹得通紅，傷心地酸酸的笑着，笑到最後，哭出來了。</p>
<p>我不敢隨便跟他扯談，我不忍聽一個同伴的笑出來的哭聲。</p>
<p>我們分手之後，已快將三年，中間我雖會見過他一次，他的氣質似乎還沒有改樣，我想考羊的病是不容易好的。</p>
<p>今夜狂風咆哮，我也悵望着天邊一天搖搖欲墮的星星，在滿天星星下，他也知道有一顆寂寞的心正在遙憶他呢？</p>

<p>這裏要記一個低能校長的生財有道。在S城裏，這位低能校長可以作一個長於辦學的標準人物。他不善詞令，不善敎學，却善於理財。</p>
<p>他那肥而矮的身軀，黑而秀的鬍鬚，應了「矮子肚裏疙瘩多」的諺語他所長的那所小學校裏，有三百來個寄宿生。每個學生在學期開始的時候，要繳一塊錢的理髮費，三塊錢的洗衣費。他從內地雇來一位理髮師，每月給他六七元的工資，專門替學生們做頂上工夫。雇了兩個中年的江北娘姨，每半年給伊門二十來元的工錢，專門替學生們做浣衣工作。兩下一算，低能校長在這三個人身上，每半年可獲純利少則八百，多便一千。</p>
<p>他因爲提倡新生活運動，在將要放假的前頭，出張布吿：凡校役酒資，一槪取消。如有私向學生討賞者，一經査實，立卽開革。一面徵收僕役費每人小洋八角。那樣一來，倒也有一二百元的額外收入。</p>
<p>提倡貨，實行淸潔運動，是低能校長理財的好政策。凡學生書籍文具，以至平時零食，槪須向校內商店開摺領取，於學期終了時結賬。不得私擅向校外購買，以免誤購舶來劣貨：或妨害衛生之食品。違者酌扣操行分數。這樣一來，那學校商店生意興隆，大有應接不暇之勢。而低能校長的荷包裏，也就「麥克麥克一了。</p>

<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>晒鹽，是生活在海濱的人民們的一種副業。</p>
<p>晒鹽的時令，是以暮春，夏天，秋天的三個時期爲適宜，炎夏和初秋的時候，鹽的成熟最迅速。而在嚴冬和初春，則因氣候酷冷的緣故，是不容易使海水晒成潔白的顆粒的。</p>
<p>當每一個晴朗天氣的早晨，或已刻，海裏的潮水，像有了規例似的，照樣又漲到海灘邊來。一條長而高闊的隄塘下面的一片曠大的鹽塲上，次序地擺起了一塊塊排列着的鹽槃子（俗稱鹽板。）；每一塊盤子裏的底層，裝起了一層薄薄的海泥。一般男女老少的鹽民們，在那兒忙着工作：男子的孩子們赤着脚，從海灘邊把海水一桶桶的挑着提着，越過隄塘，擺到鹽塲上來，鹽夫鹽婦們接着把水傾在盤子的裏面，每盤盛了十分之五的水分。分盛遍了之後，大家就把鹽盤子於每兩盤之間，蓋疊上一盤，或把牠疊成寶塔式的。。——這是因爲盤子多盤塢少的緣故，這樣，使陽光都能照拂到每盤子間的水分上去。</p>
<p>在上下半天的午飯前後，當陽光正曝晒着猛烈的當兒：他們就把鹽板上下層掉換着，凡二次。在夕陽時西下的時候，槃子裏的水分便成了晶瑩潔白的鹽塊了，於是鹽民們便用簍子把鹽搬了回來，把鹽盤都藏到鹽塲畔的一個個草棚裏面去。</p>
<p>鹽塊經了搗攪之後，便都成了散粒的了。在第二天淸晨，鹽民便把它一簍簍的挑到市上或鎭上去呌賣，或賣給鹽行裏。</p>
<p>鹽民的生計，本來當靠得住的，但因爲近年來捐稅的繁重，致鹽價高昂，農村裏因經濟破產連食鹽量都减了，所以現在已陷入了痛苦的深淵裏了！</p>

<p>不但對於各種飾物如此，就是對於衣裝，太后也　是十分注意地挑選着的。伊對於色調確有很深的研究，那幾種顏色適宜於那一個人，那幾種顏色可以不致自相衝突，知道得像美術家一般的淸楚；所以在每天舉行早朝之前，當我們這八個女官一齊穿扮好了在伊宮內等候伊老人家的時侯，伊往往要很仔細地將我們身上所穿的衣服逐一打量過，見有不稱意的，免不得就要大聲喝道：</p>

<p>有時候，這一個被斥責的女官也許還不能了解伊老人家的意思，雖不敢公然違抗，却難免有些遲疑不定的神氣，於是太后便不得不再給伊分說得淸楚一些。譬如說：</p>
<p>「你還不明白嗎？當我們在很快樂的時候，一切太淺或太顯的顏色，是會格外擾亂我們的神思的—像你此刻所穿的這一件粉紅色袍子，便是如此。它的顏色非但和你自己的容顏極不相稱，而且還要使我們瞧的人覺得異樣的刺目，所以必須換去！」（三三三）</p>

<p>— 吳愛伯</p>
<p>昨見本欄『御香縹緲錄』三二三節內有這樣的幾句話：（上略）說起張之洞，大槪沒有一個讀者不知道他的大名的，其時他正在兩湖總督任上，不過當我還是一個小孩子的時候，他却尙未做到這樣顯赫的地位，似乎正做著湖北省的制軍。（下略）照原文看起來，作者把總督與制軍分做兩個官職，這未免弄錯了。其實制軍就是總督，總督就是制軍，眞所謂『一而二二而一者也。』</p>
<p>何以故呢？原來淸代的總督，多是兼轄兩省，（也有兼轄三四省的，如兩江直隸東三省等處的總督，這是例外）。有節制該兩省文武官員的權柄，所以人家稱他爲制軍，普通的人多稱爲制台，這是前淸時代的官制，凡是在當時的人，沒有一個不曉得的。不過現在改了民國，有些人弄不淸楚罷了。德齡是個前淸的女官室，何以對於此事，也弄不淸楚呢。</p>
<p>還有一說，張之洞在前淸的時候，是由翰林內陞，再行外放。他放的外官，起首就是山西巡撫，後來由巡撫升總督，做了兩廣兩江兩湖等處的總督，一帆風順，直到終身，他並沒有做過別的小官。而且淸朝的官職，只有兩湖總督，並沒有湖北制軍，這些歷史的常識，我們是要注意的。</p>

<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>派別　自淸明以至端午，在我們鄉下，可以稱之爲一個吃粽子的季節。尤其是端午，大小百家，都得裹些粽子；因此，在故鄉有一句端午不吃粽，老來沒人送！」的俗語，以影射端午吃粽之風。上海的居民，在端午節也有吃粽子的一回熱鬧，但上海的粽子，和我們鄉下的粽子，裏法完全不同。本來現在所謂上海人，也不能代表眞正的上海人，部是各地搬來的，所以粽子，我們也不能確定究竟是何處的，不過我們粗淺的探求一下，至少可以發現「廣東粽子，」一寗波粽子，」和「蘇州粽子」幾類。寗廣的粽子，他們以結實爲上，但蘇州粽子比較以穌軟爲多，而我們鄕下的粽子，也和蘇州粽子大同小異的。因此，我們吃寗　的粽子，總覺硬得嚥不下去，吃不慣，有時鄕下帶些粽子出來，以爲奇貨可居，上海人吃慣硬粽子，吃着了我們的粽子，一定要稱贊不已，便東鄰西舍，挨戶分送了幾隻，那知事有出人意外，他們非但不說一聲好，反而說我們的粽千歟爛腐，所謂物各有所好，而對於「口之於味，有同嗜焉！」一說，我不免要懷疑起來呢！</p>
<p>裹法　故鄕松江，對於吃可算是很考究的。就是粽子，除了一部分住在農村裏的居民不十分講求外，城鎭居民，裹起粽子來也非常考究。以粽子的類別言，形式有三角粽，長粽子，以饀子說，有豆沙，百某，棗子，鮮肉，火腿，臘肉，而這裹所要一提的，便是鮮肉粽。鮮肉粽的裹法，在我們以爲最老究的便是先把肉砌成大塊，浸在上選的醬油中，糯米淘好之後，用淘籮濾乾，隨時把醬油拌在米裏，然後用粽　包裹，米肉的分量參半，裹得要鬆，裹好後用硬柴火三燒三歇，經過五六小時，粽子便熟了。大抵素粽子以三角形爲多，而輩粽子長形的居多，素粽子米裹不放醬油的，粽子裏的肉最好是油精各半，才是肥得可口，粽子也不大好弄的，裹得不好，燒得不好，就要有生米。近來上海市上所發現的泗涇粽子，也是這樣裹法，泗涇是松江的　鎮四涇粽子在松江，早已聞名好久，而最考究的粽子，除了鮮肉以外，還要加栗子，鷄肉在裏面，叫做「栗肉粽，」「鷄肉粽」。</p>
<p>吃法　粽子燒熟之後，當塲就吃，味道自然最好，但留下的，我們每天可用開水溫熱，或冷水煮熱後取食。有的人吃時還要蘸白糖，有的人不相信　，這當然可隨各人所喜。不過端午時節，天氣漸熱，粽子不能放得久，弄得不好就要壞。但我們也有方法使其久置不壞，便是每隔兩三天全數放入鍋子裏煮沸一下，此外把第一次燒粽子的水留着，粽子就放在這種水裏，也可多保藏些時日，不過過於多了也要壞的。</p>

<h3 id="c186">「生死計數鐘」及其他 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>聽說德國柏林巿中心，現將建造一「生死計數鐘」，藉以表示德國人口生殖及死亡的情形。此鐘每隔五分鐘報時一次，其間生殖的針報吿人口出生九人，指死亡的針報吿人口死亡七人，生死相抵，則德國人口每五分鐘增加二人，每年約增加二十一萬人有奇。</p>
<p>據我們所知道，現在世界有兩個國家：正在熱心實行獎勵生育。一個是德國，另一個就是意大利。牠們獎勵生育的方法很多，如微收未婚稅，舉行集團結婚，資助婚姻費（這直接是鼓勵結婚，間接也是獎勵生育），以及給獎金於生育子女的家庭（獎金的大小，卽以子女的多少爲比例）等都是。而這次柏林計劃建造中的「生死計數鐘」，這種別緻的設施，雖不能目爲獎勵生育的一法，但其對於本國人口增減的關懷，於此亦足見一斑。</p>
<p>照目前的世界經濟狀態觀察，各國的人口，是只能設法使其减少，而不應希望其增加。因爲近年來世界不景氣，日漸尖銳化，各國的失業者，一天增多一天。在這種情况之下除非是把社會的經濟組織根本改造，就惟有利用節制生育的方法，使各國的人口，逐漸减少。若獎勵生育，那是很不當的。</p>
<p>然德國及意大利，牠們現時所取的政策，却和這正相反。牠們對於本國的人口問題，十分注意，只日恐其减少，而不慮其增多。故牠們不但不贊成節制生育，甚至在實行獎勵生育。牠們希望用獎勵生育的手段，使國家的人口，能一天天增加起來。牠們這樣獎勵尙不放心，像德國，還要建造一個「生死計數鐘」，來隨時統計全國人口的生殖及死亡。</p>
<p>但在今日世界經濟恐慌當中，德意兩國，牠們爲什麽要希望本國的人口增多呢？這嗎，這是很容易解答的。我們只要一看牠們對於軍事方面的加緊準備，就可以明白牠們爲什麽要希望本國的人口增加。自然的，要戰爭，便須製造軍火。可是單有軍火，而缺少使用這軍火的人，也是無用的。因爲軍火雖厲害，究竟還不會自動跑到敵人的陣地去殲滅敵人。故戳穿了說，德意兩國的獎勵生育，希望人口增加，其用意是想養成幾批前綫的戰士。牠們一方在趕造軍火，一方在獎勵生育，這眞是一種軍備合理化。</p>
<h3 id="c187">鬚 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>

<p>靜坐下來的時候，往往手指沒來由地放在頦下去撫糜那些生硬的鬚子。牠們已經從兩鬢起蔓延到頸下，那樣蓬勃地，好像春天的野草，密密地叢生着。有時刺着手指上微微作痛。然而很多無聊的時間在這簡單的動作下消耗了，過後想起來總不免笑着自家的滑稽。</p>
<p>最近一柄保安刀廢了，那些生硬的鬚子就更發野起來，牠幾乎佔據了頸項的前半部，於是撫摩的時候不免想對鏡子照一照，牠到底把我變成了怎末一個模樣？因爲通常看見一個蓬頭垢面的乞丐，我最討厭他的就是那些蓬蓬鬆鬆的東西：想來大家都有這種意念吧，那天蔓延在我頦下及頸項之間的那些東西，要否把我變成了那個可怕的形象？</p>
<p>曾記得小時候在學校裏讀書，喜歡摸着那個光光的下巴，踏着方步，學做先生的模樣。孩子的思想當然是單純的，當時並沒有羨慕先生的尊嚴，不過學着那個模樣兒表示做先生是如此這般的。現在果然做了尊嚴的先生了，那光光的下巴底下，鬚子自然地直漫延到頸項的前半部，然而當自家撫摩着的時候，連孩子時代一點單純的思想都沒有了，只有覺得自家的滑稽。</p>
<p>對着臥室的窗是一所操塲，散學後，那些天眞的兒童興高彩烈地玩着皮球。有一個最小的學生，大槪他沒有能力和同學們搶奪，在塲的一角哭喪着臉。那學生是小班裏的，我沒有敎他的書，呌不出他名字，就在自己臥室門口向他招手。他注視了我半嚮，却始終沒有移動一步，而對於這運動的缺憾他需要一個人去同情他從那雙靈活的小眼睛底閃映是表示得很淸楚的，於是我無聊地想到這或許是先生底奪嚴所致吧？我就慢慢地走到塲角裏抱他起來。他起初使力把身體往下沉，彷彿拒絕我抱的樣子；我對他說了許多好話，明天買一個大的皮球給他，他才天眞地笑了。</p>
<p>到我臥室里，他活潑起來了，玩我的皮鞋，問我壁上的像片是誰，最後他在梳洗架上取得一柄保安刀，他好像驚奇似的問我：「先生，這是什麼？」我吿訴了他名字，他又問我有什麽用處？我當卽做着姿勢，並且把刀片裝起來。</p>
<p>「先生，那末爲什麽不把鬚子剃去呢？那樣子怕呢！」</p>
<p>「你怕鬚子嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的！像野人！」他終於說出了怕我的原因。（不是先生底尊嚴）</p>
<p>這句話深深地刺痛了我的心，這鬚子已不能挽回我的黄金時代，而反使孩子們怕我。我立卽把鬚子盡數刮光了，抱起他來吻着他的紅嫩的面頰。</p>
<p>「先生，這樣不怕人了，像爸爸一樣。」</p>
<p>他伸起小手來摸摸我的光了的下巴，但是很快地他把手抽回去了。「先生，痛！」他吿訴我。</p>
<p>是的，那些蓬亂的鬚子雖然刮去了，生硬的鬚根是無法剷除的，像要挽回我的黄金時代一樣，牠明天就要變成一個怕人的樣子的！</p>
<p>那小學生走了後，我把保安刀丟了，牠是個假面具，牠不能帮助我的眞相，或許拉我到更壞的路上去。</p>

<p>如果注心的跟在他的旁邊看他的不作的進行，眞會替他急得出汗。那小夥子相坐在黄包車上跟着他的主人，都已跑前幾丈遠去了，不住回頭的急呌着：『快呀！幹什麽？』『唉唉，』快呀，一點點路呀，』他們實在半走半等得太不耐煩，語調漸焦迫起來了：『推不來我另外雇呀，眞倒霉，雇到這死人！』</p>
<p>他老人渾身的筋，脹顫得像快裂開來的樣子，汗珠像雨般滴流着，有時從額上流過眼睛，他只爲乾着急，連揩　都沒方法。因爲他那雙手和身體，像末頭似的，緊緊握著車柄，身子不能讓牠偏一偏，如果手或身子略　鬆了點，那車子一傾，東西都會嘩啦的倒下來。他掙着盡所有的力量，像拖住急要跌下去的寶貝似的，那麼注心着他的工作；連鼻子嘴裏鬆鬆口急迫的氣都不行，前面的呌駡他更沒法回答，只乾着急。</p>
<p>『死人，死人，另雇一個。』這話更打擊着他那本來已經難以支持的將欲疲倒的枯竭的老人的精力，使他發了幾陣昏，渾身更胃火，更沒氣力。然而他極力忍着，仍舊喘着那急迫的氣，越加掙扎的進行着他的工作，渾身的筋，枯瘦的肉，抖顫得更癘害。推着，推着，不推便將挨餓呵。</p>
<p>當車子推到要從橋上，下那高斜而下的地方，老人的心跳得連手脚都難耐的發酸。前面高呌當心當心，他只好盡最後的精力冒險推下去，抖着抖右，幾乎像是跌下去的樣子，他有點昏了。剛好快抵平坦的馬路，他從上而下的那推下　的急重的力，是像拖着他似的，使他再也把握不住了，自己的身體和車子都在顫跳，氣力已盡，手一軟，嘩啦的東西跌下了幾伴，那鏡子敲碎的聲音一饗，他的眼前一陣黑。</p>
<p>主人跳下車趕到，便是一個耳光：『媽的，看你用老命賠。』老人發抖的吃吃說不出。糾紛了一會，還算沒要他老命，另雇一個。最後是拍的又是一個耳光：『沒要你的命你還要錢！眞是倒霉，逢到鬼！』精力枯竭了的老人，腿發酸軟的倒坐了去。</p>

Chinese and foreign businessmen are treated equally. In terms of management, the government's competent authority may inspect and supervise insurers and, when necessary, prohibit their business and take action. The most important thing is that foreign insurance companies must comply with the laws of the Republic of China and abandon their historically viewed special relationship of deformed legal rights. If there is any violation of the law, once verified, the competent authority will jointly prohibit its managers from sneaking into the interior to engage in the insurance business with the local government.

<h3 id="e21">Two Cases of Family Suicide <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>On the 31st of last month, a tragic case of suicide by poisoning of eight members of the Yue Lin family from Tianjin occurred in the French Concession's Maggie Road. Because Yue Lin's two suicide attempts failed, the police charged him with inciting suicide. Unexpectedly, less than ten days later, another tragedy occurred in a game field on the Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, where Zhang Yuexin's family of six committed suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of the tower in the field. The scene was so tragic that it saddened those who saw it and broke the hearts of those who heard it. According to the suicide note left by the deceased, the reason for the suicide was also economic pressure. A family that was originally wealthy was reduced to poverty. Looking back on the past, they felt that there was no joy in life, so three generations of the family committed suicide together. In this time of extreme social and economic tension, I think there are countless people who have this kind of suicidal environment. They think that it is better to die quickly than to live miserably. This situation is creating a record that has never existed in our country.</p>
<p>Suicides caused by unbearable economic pressure are found in newspapers every day, or even several cases a day. However, suicides by entire families of eight or six had been rare in the past. Unexpectedly, two cases have occurred in the past few days. This situation is not the misfortune of one person or one family, but the great misfortune of society and the country. In Yue Lin's tragic suicide case, the police charged him with inciting suicide. It is true that Yue Lin was too cruel and too tragic. It was not enough for him to commit suicide himself, but he also taught his wife and children to commit suicide together. The number of suicides totaled as many as eight. But consider why Yue Lin wanted to commit suicide? It was because of economic pressure. Why did his wife and children commit suicide together? Of course, Yue Lin himself could not live, so how could his wife and children live? It would be better for the whole family to commit suicide. If Yue Lin still had the ability to live and a way out, he would never have resorted to this last resort.</p>
<p>The meaning of criminal law is nothing more than two things: one is to punish the criminal behavior of the person so that they will not commit crimes again in the future, and the other is to warn those who have not committed crimes so that they will not commit the same crimes. This is the original intention of legislation. But when people reach the end of their rope, suicide is death, and not suicide is starvation. It is better to commit suicide cleanly. When people reach this point, no amount of severe punishment can move them, and they will never be afraid of being sentenced to inciting suicide and therefore not commit suicide. Therefore, under such circumstances, the effect of the law is equal to its text.</p>
<p>Everyone should be a good citizen and everyone should be a law-abiding person. But when you reach the end of your rope, there are only two ways out. The stronger ones will steel their hearts and take risks. There is nothing they cannot do, including kidnapping, robbery, and treason. The weaker ones either blow the flute in the Wu market or commit passive suicide. Now, our country's economic decline has reached the final stage. The countryside is bankrupt and the cities are desolate. Even in the days around the Dragon Boat Festival, I don't know how many banks, money shops, and companies have stopped operating. In this atmosphere of gloom and misery, I don't know how many people have been sacrificed. The deepening of social poverty to this point is undeniable and does not need to be denied.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Laval Abandons Forming a Cabinet, New French Government Stillborn, Pietri Ordered to Attempt to Form New Cabinet, Radical Party Agrees to Provide Full Assistance <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After a full day of consultations, Laval abandoned his attempt to form a cabinet last night. It is heard that Laval wanted the plenary powers bill to be limited to maintaining the franc, but not to include the prime minister being able to take any necessary steps to reform public finances and restore the national economy. The Radical Party only approved this by a small majority, and Laval believed that there were too few supporters, so he was unwilling to take the stage. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The President has asked Left Republican Pietri to form a new cabinet. After lengthy consultations with the President and leaders of various political parties, Pietri has taken on the task of organizing a new government. The Radical Party has agreed to provide full assistance. Pietri told journalists that he intends to invite various left-wing parties to participate in the government he forms on the broadest possible basis. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Pietri Conducts Negotiations</p>
<p>(Paris) After President Lebrun entrusted Naval Minister Pietri with the task of trying to form a new cabinet last night, Pietri is now continuing talks with various parties in an attempt to resolve the cabinet crisis. This morning, Pietri visited former Prime Minister Tardieu and Foreign Minister Laval, followed by former Prime Minister Daladier and a delegation from the Radical Socialist Party. At 10:40 a.m., he left the Ministry of the Navy to visit former Prime Minister Flandin and former Finance Minister Caillaux. In the afternoon, he received leaders of the Socialist Party again. At 2:55 p.m., Radical Party member of parliament, Malvy, visited Pietri at the Ministry of the Navy and declared to the press that "the future of the political situation is clearer than yesterday." It is noted that a new cabinet must have the participation of the Radical Party in order to gain the support of the majority in the parliament. Therefore, Pietri's talks with the Radical Party leaders this morning are of utmost importance. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Avoiding the Mistakes of the Previous Cabinet</p>
<p>(Paris) Reliable sources say that after Right-wing Republican leader Pietri was ordered to form a cabinet, in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous cabinet, he decided not to ask parliament for full powers. According to Pietri's plan, if a new government can be formed, he only intends to issue three important government decrees as follows: (1) Regarding the issuance of currency; (2) Regarding balancing the budget; (3) Regarding the revival of the national economy. The above-mentioned decrees will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for approval before the summer recess. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>It is heard that Pietri told Radical Party leaders that he does not intend to ask parliament for full powers, but only to request the passage of bills in a short period of time to protect the value of the franc and suppress currency speculation. His method is to prepare several bills and submit them gradually, requesting parliament to grant the necessary executive powers. If necessary, the parliamentary session should be extended as much as possible so that it can monitor government actions at any time. Before government orders are published in the Government Gazette, they should first be submitted to the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies for review. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Laval Retreats Knowing the Difficulty</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Laval declined to form a cabinet at 8:00 p.m., and President Lebrun then entrusted Naval Minister Pietri with the task of trying to form a new cabinet. Pietri stated that he would only be able to decide whether to accept the order after consulting with various political parties, especially the Radical Socialist Party. The details of the situation are recorded below. Before 7:00 p.m., the Radical Socialist Party group passed a motion by a vote of 31 to 27 and sent it to Laval. The resolution stated, "The government's full powers should be limited to protecting the franc and stopping speculation." Laval was unable to accept this, which is regrettable. " This resolution indicated that the Radical Socialist Party could not assist Laval. Laval then visited President Lebrun at 7:00 p.m. Before entering the Presidential Palace, Laval declared that, in view of the Radical Socialist Party group's vote yesterday, it would be difficult for the government to obtain a large majority in the Chamber of Deputies. This kind of majority is essential to protect the franc and stop speculative behavior. After talking with the President and resigning, Laval again declared to the press that he had widely solicited the opinions of political parties and deeply felt that it would be difficult for the Chamber of Deputies to grant the government the necessary powers. Since there is no large majority party in the Chamber of Deputies that understands the necessity of effectively reducing government spending to back the government, even if the coalition cabinet he advocates is established, it will definitely not have all the necessary capabilities to protect the franc. Subsequently, the President summoned Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot, group chairman Delbos, and Naval Minister Pietri. Pietri left the Presidential Palace at 10:15 p.m. and said that the President had entrusted him with the task of forming a cabinet. He believed that without the necessary full powers, it would be difficult to quickly find an effective solution to the political crisis. Pietri then visited Senate Speaker Janan and planned to consult with Chamber of Deputies Speaker Poisson, Deputy Speaker Chamard, former Prime Minister Flandin, and Herriot Laval that evening, and then meet with the chairmen of various party groups and committees in both houses and important figures in the political arena tomorrow morning.

<p>The Two Left-Wing Parties Failed to Reach a Compromise</p>
<p>(Paris) The Socialist Party, in a joint meeting of left-wing parties,</p>
<p>presented a motion to answer the questions raised by the Radical Socialist Party. (1) The Socialist Party has no preconceived notions about the prime minister candidate, and is only concerned with the government's policy program. (2) The Socialist Party advocates nationalizing various major industries, such as electricity and insurance. (3) The Socialist Party's political program is as follows: (a) Oppose currency devaluation, and advocate abolishing forward exchange transactions to protect the franc and stop speculation; (b) Establish a national fund to implement a 40-hour work week and launch large-scale projects to relieve unemployment; (c) Dissolve various fascist groups to protect people's freedom; (d) Re-elect the parliament in order to produce a majority party. (4) The Socialist Party opposes the full powers bill. After the left-wing joint meeting presented this motion for discussion, it decided to postpone the decision. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During the Radical Socialist Party group meeting, former Aviation Minister Cot and Chamber of Deputies Military Committee reporter Archambaud, although advocated cooperating with the orthodox Socialist Party, (It is noted that when the left-wing party groups held a joint meeting yesterday, the Radical Socialist Party raised four questions to the Socialist Party, which have been answered by the Socialist Party, but the party group believes that the suggestions made by orthodox Socialist Party leader Léon Blum are unacceptable, and believes that there is no need to continue negotiations with the orthodox party. This will not lead to a break with the left-wing parties' joint meeting. The left-wing parties' joint meeting held a meeting yesterday and passed a resolution advocating that the new government should be backed by the strength of civilian and labor groups to destroy speculative behavior and protect democratic system, and prepare to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies. In addition, it was decided to continue discussions in order to formulate a common political program. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Monarchists Gather for a Demonstration</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Action Française" members organized by the monarchists have doubled their courage since destroying the small newspaper advocating franc devaluation yesterday. Today, they gathered a crowd to the Eastern Mansion of the Freemasons and threw stones, destroying all the windows. At this point, onlookers along the way joined in and intended to rush to the Grand Concert Hall in the central transportation area. However, the police gathered at this time and dispersed the crowd. Seven people who stubbornly resisted the police were arrested by the police. The "Fiery Cross," organized by veterans, has posted slogans all over the country, stating, "The national treasury is now empty, peace is precarious, and the people hope for work and bread. The government that attempted to prevent speculation was overthrown by parliament in 24 hours. Right-wing members who are slaves of capitalism and left-wing members who are slaves of Marxism are now preparing for civil war. We advocate stopping them immediately." (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e23">British Cabinet to be Reorganized Today, List of New Cabinet Members to be Announced Soon <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(London) The entire country is now actively paying attention to the scene of how the national unity government will be reorganized. Rumors are rife, but two things are now certain: one is that Lord President Baldwin will replace MacDonald as Prime Minister, and the other is that Sir Simon will no longer serve as Foreign Secretary. MacDonald will hold some kind of leisurely position in the new cabinet, such as Lord President of the Council. He will not have any departmental duties, and can contribute his opinions at any time and on any matter as a veteran, and can sometimes undertake special missions in the diplomatic field. Those who discuss politics are still unable to fully understand Baldwin's views, but Secretary of State for India Hoare has expressed great interest in foreign affairs, so there is now a rumor that he will be transferred to serve as Foreign Secretary. If so, the post of Secretary of State for India will likely belong to the Marquis of Zetland, who is a writer, traveler, and politician. He served as Governor of Bengal from 1916 to 1922, and recently served as a member of the India Joint Committee. Lord Privy Seal Eden, although he has done a lot of work in the diplomatic field and has a distinguished reputation, may still need some time to gain experience before he can serve as Foreign Secretary. Eden is currently 38 years old, and many consider him to be too young to take on this position, but he will definitely occupy a position in the cabinet, but it is still undetermined what position he will hold.</p>
<p>MacDonald will go to Buckingham Palace tomorrow to resign to the King, and then leave London to return to his hometown of Lossiemouth to recuperate. As everyone knows, MacDonald's resignation is due to the advice of doctors, and because his constitution is not strong, he cannot hold such a demanding position for long. MacDonald took office as Prime Minister on June 8, 1929, and until today, among British Prime Ministers in the past hundred years, only Asquith and MacDonald have continued in office longer than him.</p>
<p>Baldwin will also enter the palace tomorrow to be given the order to form a cabinet, and announce the new cabinet members. Baldwin is the leader of the Conservative Party and can occupy a majority in the House of Commons, so there is no issue of dissolving parliament, and it will continue until the general election next year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, MacDonald hosted the German delegation at the Prime Minister's residence. This was probably MacDonald's last time chairing an international gathering in his capacity as leader of the British government. His son, Malcolm MacDonald, also has political talent. He is currently 34 years old and serves as Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. It is expected that he will be promoted to Minister of that department or Minister of the Colonies in the new cabinet. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<p>(London) The talk of former Prime Minister Lloyd George joining the new cabinet seems to have less and less hope of materializing. The government announced today a plan to build a new underground railway and electrify several railways. It is generally believed that this plan is a response to Lloyd George's proposed large-scale public works plan. The national government wants to preemptively prevent Lloyd George from using the excuse of demanding the implementation of public works to attack the government in the future. In short, it is obvious that the government does not want Lloyd George to join the new cabinet. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(London) The House of Commons today passed the Government of India Act by a vote of 386 to 122. The three major principles, namely (1) an All-India Federation, (2) Provincial Autonomy, and (3) Responsible Government, have not been changed.

The Secretary of State for India spoke a total of 228 times during the debate, and Under-Secretary of State Butler also spoke 247 times. The right wing of the Labor Party and the Conservatives led by Churchill, although they had different positions, both voted against this case. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">German Reply to British Note, Wording is Extremely Vague, No Clear Explanation for the Points Inquired <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government previously ordered its ambassador to Germany, Phipps, to request the German government to provide a detailed explanation of certain points in the speech made by Head of State Hitler on May 21. It is now heard that the German government has sent a reply to the British government, but the wording is very vague and there is very little explanation of new facts. The German note did not give a clear answer to the British question of whether Germany requires obtaining colonies in order to be considered as reducing discriminatory treatment. There is also no clear explanation of Hitler's proposal to conclude non-aggression pacts with Germany's neighboring countries. It only stated that Germany's attitude towards non-aggression pacts in Eastern Europe can only be explained after the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact have responded to Germany's objections to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact. As for the size of the army, Germany believes that the number of 550,000 for the standing army cannot be changed. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(Rome) What kind of attitude does Germany take towards the Austrian issue and the Danube Pact? Although this was mentioned in Hitler's speech on May 21, it was not detailed. The Italian government requested Germany to make a clear explanation a few days ago. In the middle, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Ambassador to Italy Hassel had several talks. So far, Germany's attitude has been generally clear. It is heard that Germany's participation in the Danube Conference is subject to two conditions: (1) The pact of non-interference in internal affairs should treat all signatory countries equally; (2) In addition to the multilateral Danube Pact, no bilateral mutual assistance pacts should be concluded. Germany said that the Franco-Italian agreement of January 7 stipulates that the purpose of the Danube Conference is to condemn all propaganda that changes Austria's political system and territorial integrity by violence. Therefore, Germany believes that only violent propaganda should be condemned, and legitimate and peaceful propaganda should be allowed. As for bilateral mutual assistance pacts, Germany has raised objections to both the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact and the Czech-Soviet mutual assistance pact, and naturally has the same concerns about the Danube bilateral mutual assistance pact. Germany believes that if bilateral mutual assistance pacts are necessary, all the provisions of the mutual assistance pacts should be published before the pact of non-interference in internal affairs is signed. Germany's attitude is quite similar to that of Hungary, which makes Italy feel quite difficult. As for the Little Entente countries, they believe that bilateral mutual assistance pacts are absolutely necessary, while Italy adopts an eclectic attitude of "it doesn't matter if it has or doesn't have it."

<p>Prague. Foreign Minister Beneš left Prague at 2:40 this afternoon for Moscow. It is expected that he will arrive in the Russian capital at 11:00 a.m. on the 8th of this month. At that time, the Soviet authorities will welcome him, as they did when French Foreign Minister Laval went to Russia. Mrs. Beneš and Cabinet Secretary-General Gutschke accompanied him. French Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Nacia and other dignitaries went to the station to see him off. Soviet Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Alexandrovsky had already set off a few days ago to wait in Warsaw and accompany him to Moscow. Beneš will stay in the Soviet Union for eight days. It is generally believed that the recent signing of a trade agreement and a mutual assistance pact between the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union, and the establishment of a loan agreement, whereby a Czech banking group lends 250 million crowns to the Soviet government for the purchase of Czech goods, requires Beneš to personally visit the Soviet Union, which is an important step for the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union to work together to maintain lasting peace.

<p>(Paris) Japanese ambassadors and ministers to various European countries continued to hold a meeting this morning, which lasted from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. At the beginning of the meeting, a general discussion was held on the reports submitted by the ambassadors and ministers yesterday. The meeting was originally scheduled to close today, but due to the importance of the various debates, it was decided to continue the meeting tomorrow. As for the issues raised at the meeting this morning, they will be discussed at the meeting this afternoon. According to unofficial sources, the report submitted by Japanese Minister to Switzerland Hotta yesterday made a deep impression at the meeting. Hotta was ordered to pay special attention to the situation in Central Europe, the Little Entente, and the Balkan countries. Japan's diplomatic policy towards the policies of Western European countries in Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula is too complicated, so it takes a non-participatory attitude. This can be verified by Hotta's report. In addition, it was decided at the meeting that Ambassador to Germany Mushanokoji would return home with Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira. The above is the important result of the meetings in the past two days. The reasons for Mushanokoji and Matsudaira's return this time are generally explained as follows: Mushanokoji's report pointed out that Germany is trying to cooperate with Japan, but Japan has refused. Therefore, he must return home to request instructions from the government. As for Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira, there were differences of opinion with Japanese representative Rear Admiral Yamamoto during the London Naval Conference last November, and there have been rumors of his resignation.

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance convened a Japan-Manchukuo Financial and Economic Conference on the afternoon of the 5th because of the return of Arakawa Masatsugu, the financial advisor of the Kwantung Army, to study the financial state of "Manchukuo". According to Arakawa's report, the opinion of controlling Japan-Manchukuo finance in "Manchukuo" is radical. That is, the currency of Manchukuo, because silver coins are affected by the rise in silver prices, flows out of the country, gradually reducing its number, and Japanese gold capital flows into the country, expanding the circulation of Bank of Chosen banknotes. The function of the Central Bank of Manchuria to control finance is weakening day by day. Therefore, it wants to restrict the circulation of Bank of Chosen banknotes, unify finance with the national currency, and make the function of the central bank complete. At the same time, the Central Bank of Manchuria and the Bank of Chosen will establish a currency alliance and set a certain exchange rate to prevent the fluctuation of foreign value. However, the Japanese government still has objections to this, that is, the increase in Bank of Chosen banknotes is based on actual needs, so it is inappropriate to disregard the actual situation and suddenly withdraw the banknotes. As for the foreign value, the exchange rate between Japan and Manchukuo will not fall below equality because the central bank's reserves are mostly Japanese gold deposits. In short, Japan strives to avoid drastic reforms to prevent financial chaos. (Japan Union Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The 20th session of the League of Nations Opium Advisory Committee concluded today, passing a report to the Executive Yuan. The report outlines the situation of drug prohibition in the world in the past year, and pays special attention to the situation of private trafficking in the Far East. A special chapter is devoted to China's drug prohibition achievements. The committee's main decision is to include the issue of "what measures should governments take to seal up illegal drug manufacturing plants" on the agenda of the next session. The committee has also instructed the Secretariat to study the number of smokers and drug consumption in the world, and estimate the total output based on the total number of privately-made drug agencies that have been cracked down on so far, in order to find out how much smuggled drugs there are in the world. The committee recognizes the new drug prohibition regulations recently implemented by the Chinese government, and unanimously praises its efforts in drug prohibition. The members are particularly impressed by Chairman Chiang's vigorous and unremitting efforts in drug prohibition, and believe that Chiang has clearly understood that China's opium prohibition methods cannot be successful without major reforms. Therefore, he resolutely replaced the infeasible immediate prohibition plan with a feasible six-year prohibition plan. In addition, the reduction of opium production in Yunnan and other places, the establishment of drug rehabilitation centers, the treatment of 81,000 drug addicts in one year, and the severity of penalties have all given the committee a good impression. The committee is deeply saddened by the situation in Manchuria and Jehol, but is obviously unwilling to discuss it in open meetings. However, it is well aware of the seriousness of the situation, and the Chinese government cannot be responsible, and the impact will probably constrain the Chinese government's efforts in North China and other places. In addition, China's latest drug prohibition regulations have been scheduled for discussion at the next meeting. Some members regret that there are no statistics on drug prohibition tax revenue. In short, China's contribution to global drug prohibition in the past twelve months is greater than that of any other country, which has been confirmed, and the increase in prestige in the international arena is undeniable.

<h3 id="e36">US Silver Purchase Policy Becomes Another Mystery of the Current Situation; Ministry of Finance Reduces Purchases but Congressmen Take No Action; New Proposal by Senator Walsh <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Ministry of Finance has recently deliberately reduced silver purchases, yet silver bloc congressmen have taken no action. Observers today find this quite perplexing. In the past, whenever the Ministry of Finance slightly relaxed its silver purchase plan, silver bloc congressmen would immediately propose vigorous motions to compel Finance Minister Morgenthau to intensify purchases. Therefore, the recent lack of response from the silver bloc, coupled with the statements of Representatives Dies and Martin, raises further questions about the silver bloc's attitude. Well-informed sources here believe that the Ministry of Finance's gradual approach to silver is due to the following two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) To maintain the Exchange Stabilization Fund without using it, in preparation for the collapse of the European gold standard group, so as to adjust drastic changes in the dollar exchange rate.</p>
<p>(2) To allow China and other countries adversely affected by the silver purchase policy to slightly ease their situations, so that they can each reorganize their monetary policies.</p>
<p>Today, Democratic Senator Walsh introduced a bill advocating authorizing the Ministry of Finance to delineate the scope of silver for monetary use and silver for commercial use. This is the only expression of interest in silver in Congress. Walsh stated that the purpose of the bill is to prevent fluctuations in the price of silver for commercial use. At the same time, Finance Minister Morgenthau has amended the regulations on licenses for the import of foreign silver coins set on August 17th of last year, stipulating that only the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or government representatives may import silver coins without a license, but American silver coins may still be imported without a license. Licensees must also prove that the imported silver coins are for repayment of legitimate debts and have obtained permission from the foreign government, or are especially treasured by collectors, it is said.</p>
<p>Senator Walsh's proposal will not have a major impact on the United States' silver policy, as the bill does not restrict the import of silver bullion. Monetary experts believe that prohibiting the import of foreign silver coins is not significant internationally, as silver coins can be melted into silver bullion and then imported, and this method has already been implemented. It is said that the greatest value of prohibiting the import of silver coins is that it can provide cooperative assistance to countries that prohibit the export of silver coins.

<p>(Washington) There is talk in Congress today of enacting legislation to preserve the shell of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), but this matter has not yet been finally decided, nor is it known what basis will be used to create this legislation. Addressing a gathering of New England bankers in Massachusetts today, former NRA Director General Johnson said that many resolutions passed by trade associations supporting the continued maintenance of industry standards were merely perfunctory plans, and that they would revert to their old ways after Congress adjourned. He predicted that turmoil would arise after the NRA's demise. Chamber of Commerce President Shepley praised the NRA's plan without industry standards, saying that this was exactly what the business community wanted. At the same time, the Executive Committee of the American Federation of Labor is currently meeting to discuss the NRA plan with a hostile attitude. Chairman Jones of the House Agriculture Committee stated today that the licensing methods of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) will now be completely abolished and replaced by prudent regulations and limited authority, which will be entrusted to the Secretary of Agriculture, who will issue appropriate orders. It is said that President Roosevelt issued a warning today that if the Wagner Labor Act and the Guffey Coal Stabilization Act cannot be passed, the government may have to declare martial law to prevent riots. President Roosevelt believes that since the NRA no longer exists, these two acts are indispensable. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Anglo-German Naval Talks: Britain Tries to Narrow Germany's Demands; German Representatives Request Time to Consider and Reply <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(London) Anglo-German naval representatives continued their talks today. According to the German representatives' previous announcement of Germany's naval construction plan, its total tonnage will account for 35% of the British Navy's total tonnage, including five battleships, sixteen cruisers, and fifty destroyers. The British side believes that the construction of five battleships may be acceptable, but the construction of many cruisers and destroyers would endanger the British Navy's dominance in the North Sea. If Germany's demands are accepted, Britain will inevitably increase its naval shipbuilding program to cope with the emerging situation. This is the main point of disagreement between Britain and Germany. During today's talks, Britain tried to narrow the scope of Germany's demands, advocating that the quality of all types of warships built by Germany should be limited. According to informal naval circles, the British representatives expressed during the talks their hope that, in terms of quality, each German battleship would be limited to 35,000 tons, cruisers to 10,000 tons, battleships would not be equipped with guns exceeding 12 inches in diameter, and cruisers would not be equipped with guns exceeding 6 inches in diameter. In terms of quantity, the British delegation advocated that Germany's shipbuilding plan should be divided into several years for phased construction. From these two proposals, it can be seen that Britain's intention and purpose are to ensure that the work of future naval conferences is not undermined by Germany's rearmament of its navy. After receiving the conditions proposed by Britain, the German representatives requested considerable time to consider and reply. Therefore, the Anglo-German talks have been postponed to Friday or next Tuesday for continuation. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) There has been no news for a long time about the Anglo-American-Japanese naval negotiations, and the opening of a naval conference is even more distant. It is learned that Japan has indicated to Britain and the United States that if the two countries can reduce the tonnage of each type of warship, Japan can also qualitatively limit the number of ships. It seems that naval negotiations may have new developments, which is not impossible. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Viscount Byng died of internal illness at the age of 73. Doctors performed surgery on him on Tuesday, but unexpectedly it was unsuccessful. The outside world is deeply shocked by this, as the general's illness did not seem very serious before the surgery. During World War I, Byng initially led only a cavalry division, and later rose to become a general commanding 250,000 troops. All Canadian soldiers who participated in the war were under his command. In recent years, he was old and frail, so he resided in southern France and South Africa. (6th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) General von Linsingen, who served as the commander of the German Southern Army during World War I and was renowned for his achievements, died here today at the age of 85. The general retired in 1918, ashamed to wear military uniform again because of Germany's acceptance of the humiliating Treaty. Since Hitler came to power, the general was often seen attending public meetings of veterans' associations in military uniform. During the German Revolution of 1918, the general served as the commander of the Brandenburg Province. On the day the revolution broke out, the general ordered the bombing of Berlin from the air to prevent the concentration of the revolutionary party, but this order was immediately revoked by the Ministry of War to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Thereupon, the general forbade his troops from using weapons to show his protest. Soon, his subordinates also joined the revolutionary party. The general resigned on November 17, 1918.

<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York Cotton Market: Today was quite mixed. After opening, the price fell 4 pounds compared to yesterday. It then rose and fell, and investor sentiment was uncertain. The reason for this is developments in Washington. The government's proposed annual subsidy of 100 million yuan for agricultural exports may have the effect of raising prices in the market, but if the handling fee still exists, merchants will inevitably have a pessimistic attitude. It is heard that the weather conditions seem to have improved slightly compared to before.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: Today it was looser. At 1 PM, the July price was 6.22, 5 pounds lower than yesterday's close.</p>

<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: Today's market situation opened stably and then became semi-dormant. At noon, the transaction price for July was 6 pence and 0625 points, the same as yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York: Today's opening was stable. The price for July was 12.62, no different from yesterday's close. Merchants lacked interest, and there was a lack of exciting news, so the price before noon did not fluctuate much.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: The opening this morning was quite firm, and the market price had an upward trend. Investor sentiment was very stable. Whether the market price will continue to rise depends on the development of the French political situation. The average price of 30 Dow Jones industrial stocks was 114.18, 26 pounds higher than yesterday. The market prices of New York items are listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e82">The Work of Suppressing the Red Bandits and Building Sichuan <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>——Address by Chairman Chiang at the Tea Party with Gentlemen and Elders in the Sichuan Provincial Capital——</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence. At 4 p.m. on the 3rd, Chairman Chiang invited gentlemen, elders, financial magnates, and representatives of people's organizations from the provincial capital to a tea party at the administrative headquarters. A total of 64 people attended, including Fang Xu, Zeng Jian, Xu Jiong, Yin Changling, Liu Xianrong, Zhou Daogang, and Chen Guodong. Li Hongkun, Chief of Staff of the Supervisory Office and Garrison Commander, and Zhong Tigan, the mayor, were responsible for the reception, and Zhong introduced each of them to Chairman Chiang. The gentlemen and elders contributed many opinions on governing Sichuan and saving the country. Chairman Chiang gave an impromptu speech as follows: "I have been in Chengdu for a week now. I originally intended to meet with you gentlemen earlier, but I was slightly delayed due to business. Today, I have specially invited you here to discuss together and listen to your advice. I have just heard your remarks, which are all brilliant and pertinent, and can be said to be the words of truth. They have a great relationship to the future of Sichuan. Not only Sichuan, but the entire country cannot be governed without following the principles you have discussed."</p>
<p>The Work of Suppressing the Red Bandits and Building Sichuan in the Future</p>
<p>"You gentlemen have been living in your hometowns for a long time, and you have a detailed understanding of the actual situation in the area and various reforms. I don’t need to add more. There are too many things in the past, and I don’t have time to discuss them today. Let them pass with time. What we need to study most urgently is how to promote the work of suppressing the Red Bandits and building Sichuan in the future. Regarding this point, I hope that you will tell me your opinions at any time and plan together, so that the banditry can be quelled quickly, the situation in Sichuan can be stabilized early, and the people of the whole province can live and work in peace. You gentlemen expect a lot from me, but if you want to save the people of Sichuan from their dire situation and enable them to live and work in peace as soon as possible, it cannot be achieved by bringing a few troops and a few salaries. The problem in Sichuan today is not the lack of troops, nor the lack of salaries, but the depravity of people's hearts and the decline of social customs. If this cannot be revitalized and transformed, then any effort will ultimately be ineffective, and all undertakings will be hopeless. On the contrary, if people's hearts are revitalized and social customs are renewed, then the impetus for improvement will be unstoppable, and everyone will have no choice but to do good. Then, all problems in military affairs, politics, society, and economy can be easily solved. Therefore, revitalizing people's hearts and transforming social customs are the fundamental strategies for suppressing the Red Bandits and building Sichuan today. I sincerely hope that you elders and virtuous gentlemen, based on the principle of "responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation," will devote yourselves to the cause of educating the country, take responsibility, and work hard in this regard. We must first renew social customs, and then we can talk about the construction of Sichuan. If a new Sichuan can be built successfully, it will surely be a model province and the foundation for the revival of the nation, so that our Republic of China will gradually move towards unification and stability, and then towards a long-lasting and prosperous realm."</p>
<p>The Goal of Cultivating New Social Customs is Divided into Six Items</p>
<p>"There are many conditions needed to revitalize people's hearts and transform social customs. The key is that the government authorities and general social leaders can determine the goals, set an example, and work together in many ways. Now, based on what I have always encouraged myself and what you gentlemen have mentioned today, and what Sichuan Province urgently needs to cultivate in the future, I will describe six goals as follows: First, clumsiness. In terms of things, Sichuan is blessed by nature and is the richest. It must not be said to be poor. In terms of people, I believe that the intelligence of the people of Sichuan is the best in the country. However, excessive cleverness has led to many drawbacks, resulting in the current situation where they compete to seize advantages and fear falling behind, and avoid difficulties and only know how to be opportunistic, wanting to seek advantages. As a result, everyone fails and suffers. Cleverness is self-defeating, which is lamentable. Therefore, if we want to revitalize people's hearts and transform social customs today, we must first persuade the people to be clumsy. All true undertakings in the world come from honest effort and hard struggle. They cannot be achieved by being opportunistic, and there is no advantage to be gained. Moreover, things in the world are constantly changing, and people's hearts in the end times are full of tricks. We can only use clumsiness to control cleverness and use reality to break through falsehood, so that we can achieve something. Transforming social customs and saving Sichuan and the country are the top priorities. Therefore, I hope that you gentlemen will advocate simplicity for the people of Sichuan. Second, sincerity. "Without sincerity, there is nothing." "Sincerity is like a god." Establishing oneself and establishing a nation, from ancient times to the present, the first important thing is to open one's heart sincerely. Today, people's hearts are frivolous and hypocritical, and they are accustomed to mechanical deception to the extreme. Sichuan Province has been chaotic for many years, and the accumulated malpractices are particularly deep. Intrigues and infighting have become the norm. From now on, we should remove this root cause and vigorously correct the malpractices of the times, taking morality as the purpose and loyalty as the appeal. The ancients said, "Where sincerity is, even metal and stone can be opened." If our government authorities and social leaders can sincerely advocate for the people, they will surely be able to revitalize people's hearts and renew social customs in the shortest possible time. Third, public. When the Great Way is practiced, the world belongs to all. Since ancient times, only those who can open their hearts sincerely, practice justice, be selfless, and forget their families for the sake of the country can succeed in their careers and contribute to the world and the country. Today, people's hearts are depraved due to selfishness. Once selfishness exists, deception arises, and competition begins. As a result, the four virtues are not promoted, and disasters never end. The past events of Sichuan have been deeply poisoned by this selfishness. In the future, if we want to revitalize people's hearts, transform social customs, restore order, and save the province and the country, we must advocate impartiality for all the people of the province. Fourth, hard work. If you want to change customs and habits, it is important to set an example and inspire the masses. It is even more important to take the lead in hard work, to endure what others cannot endure, and to do what others do not want to do. Or avoid danger and fear difficulties, and seek temporary security. I must take risks and assume difficulties, taking self-suffering as pleasure. Only in this way can we move people's hearts and make them ashamed of fearing difficulties and seeking temporary security, and ashamed of seizing profits and abandoning righteousness, and consciously and vigorously follow me and advance towards goodness. From ancient times to the present, scholars and gentlemen who have saved people's hearts, transformed the world, settled great disasters, and achieved great achievements have all done so. I am willing to encourage each other with you elders and virtuous gentlemen. Fifth, thrift. "The failure of a country is due to the corruption of officials." The prevalence of bandits is mostly caused by greed and evil. Therefore, clean politics is an essential element for thoroughly suppressing bandits and a prerequisite for all construction. To achieve clean politics and eliminate corruption, the government must strictly enforce laws and regulations and rectify official rules. In society, it is necessary to promote thrift in order to correct the bad habit of extravagance, eliminate the psychology of indulgence, and cultivate the virtues of frugality, integrity, and uprightness. The so-called "plainness clarifies ambition, and frugality nourishes integrity" refers to this. According to the current situation in Sichuan Province, the painful lives of the majority of the people and the extreme extravagance of a small number of people have almost become two extremes. All kinds of disasters arise from this. Therefore, to quell disasters, we must rectify people's hearts and advocate thrift. Sixth, strictness. I have just heard your gentlemen's heartfelt remarks, and I am deeply aware that discipline is the most important thing today. You have cited the example of Zichan governing Zheng with severity and Zhuge Liang governing Shu with strictness. I remember that Hu Linyi once said, "Without the means of thunder, the heart of a Bodhisattva cannot be shown." "Using severity to govern chaos" is a matter of last resort. Sichuan has been chaotic for many years and has not been governed for a long time. From now on, how to clarify officialdom, rectify official rules, eliminate corruption and punish the cunning? We should implement strict policies with the most impartial heart. Government authorities and social leaders should jointly take rectifying discipline and making clear penalties and abiding by the law as the primary task of the new beginning. Then, quelling chaos in the invisible and eliminating malpractices to promote benefits will be great."</p>
<p>"Today, I invited you gentlemen here to meet and talk, and I am very happy and grateful to hear your advice. I would like to propose the above six characters for joint discussion. If you gentlemen agree, please use them as the guidelines for military affairs, politics, and society in the future, and work together to create a new opportunity. I also hope that we can discuss them at any time and promote them together, so that people's hearts will be revitalized, social customs will be transformed, and the construction of Sichuan and the revival of China will depend on them."

<h3 id="e83">The National Capital's Air Defense Exhibition Opens Yesterday <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>—Yang Jie Reports on the Significance of the Exhibition—</p>
<p>Beijing News. In order to universally instill air defense knowledge among the masses, the Air Defense Committee held an air defense exhibition in the First Park. The association held an opening ceremony at the public stadium on Park Road at 9 a.m. on the 6th. The chairman of the conference was Yang Jie, the chairman of the Air Defense Committee. About 30,000 people from various ministries, commissions, agencies, organizations, representatives of military schools, all students, and people from all walks of life attended. After Yang Jie led the salute, he first reported on the significance and preparations for the exhibition, stating: "Now, the method of warfare is based on scientific progress and the development of the air force. It has progressed from a flat plane to a three-dimensional war range and has expanded from the front to the rear and local areas of the country. Therefore, air defense is the most important task in national defense today. Our country is under the watchful eyes of the powers. At this time of emergency, when a world war is imminent, we should pay attention to air defense facilities in order to reduce the casualties of air force attacks. However, our country's air defense cause is still in its infancy. It is not easy to succeed without the joint efforts of the military and civilians. This association wants to arouse the attention of the masses to air defense and try to universally instill air defense knowledge. A special air defense exhibition will be held in Beijing, using various air defense charts, models, movies, photos, and texts to show the tragic enemy air force attacks and the necessary preparations for air defense. Audiences can fully understand the importance of air defense and the advantages and disadvantages of the air force. Unfortunately, the time is tight, and all the equipment in the meeting is far from what is hoped for. The performances are childish, which is inevitable. Please forgive the audience." Next, Tang Shengzhi, the Director of Training, gave a speech, stating: "Just now, the chairman gave a detailed speech on the important meaning of air defense, and I will not repeat it. This air defense exhibition collected various air defense equipment, models, charts, and publications. Various small pamphlets provide very detailed instructions on the air defense knowledge and equipment that modern citizens should have. I hope that after the people visit, they will immediately follow the guidance of the Air Defense Committee to engage in the preparation of civil air defense equipment and actively promote air defense knowledge to the people. Do not regard it as empty talk, or even let the impressions gained from the visit disappear with the closing of the exhibition." Next, Zhang Daofan gave a speech, stating that the people of our country have too little knowledge of air defense. Sun Yat-sen advocated saving the country through aviation more than ten years ago, hoping that the people would expand their knowledge, devote themselves to studying various air defense equipment, and unanimously help the government "consolidate air defense." Next, the foreign guest Si Tuobang gave a speech, stating that all the continental military powers in the world are now paying attention to the development of the air force. Once a war breaks out, the air force will not only bomb military positions, but also the cities and important towns in the rear. If China declares war on a country with new military equipment one day, even on the first day or even the first hour of the declaration of war, enemy planes may be found over Nanjing. Complete air defense preparations are the only guarantee of safety. I hope that people in your country will unanimously understand the importance of air defense and actively engage in the construction of various air defense equipment. Next, Yuan Yeqiu and Zhou Bomin from the Beijing Municipal Party Committee gave speeches. The ceremony was then completed, photos were taken, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>In order to promote the people's attention to air defense, the association printed a letter to the people, which was distributed at the venue and in the urban area. The full text is as follows: "Compatriots, the evolution of modern science has reached its peak. In terms of military affairs, various forms of warfare have also evolved in sequence with scientific inventions. In the past, the army and navy fought on the front line on a flat plane. Now, airplanes and bombs are used to carry out three-dimensional warfare in the air. The scope of the war has also expanded from the front line to the rear. In the past, national defense only needed to focus on the border. As long as the border was secure, the country could be as stable as a rock. Now, it is not the case. The improvement and advancement of aircraft has reached a thousand miles a day. The flight radius can reach 2,000 kilometers. The power of various poisonous gases, bacteria, and explosive bombs can destroy humans and various buildings in an instant. Unfortunately, once a war breaks out, even if the front-line forces are strong and the border defense is solid, if the rear is not well prepared for air defense, it may be destroyed by enemy aircraft at any time and anywhere. Therefore, air defense is the most important and urgent task of modern warfare. The seriousness of the Far East issue and the urgency of the European situation are enough to show the arrival of the Second World War. All the powers are also doing their best to expand their military equipment, increase their military budget, and extend the term of military service. They are preparing for war in order to survive in the war. Our country is the center of the Far East issue and the flashpoint of this war. No matter when and where it breaks out, our country will inevitably be drawn into the vortex. All our people should work diligently and wholeheartedly to seek the soundness of national defense and air defense, and to respond to the future war. However, our country's science is known to be backward, and the general public is not clear about the importance and significance of air defense. When the air defense exercise was held in the capital last winter, a propaganda week was organized to work hard on publicity. However, as a result, there were still few people who recognized air defense as a serious issue, and most people did not pay much attention to it, and even regarded it as a child's play. It should be known that if the general public cannot fully understand air defense knowledge, it will not be easy to train the air defense organization at ordinary times. Once war comes and enemy planes arrive suddenly, they will inevitably be in a panic and suffer many unexpected damages. The damage suffered is many times greater than that of organized and trained people. In order to universally instill air defense knowledge, the Association specially held an air defense exhibition, using a variety of charts, models, equipment, pictures, and movies to show the performance of various aircraft and air defense weapons, the destructive power of various bombs, how to organize air defense intelligence monitoring and alarms, how to deploy passive air defense, how to control lighting and transportation, how to equip fire prevention and poison prevention and disinfection, and how all military and civilians should unanimously cooperate in air defense. We must ensure that the people who visit the exhibition can fully understand air defense knowledge, truly recognize how important the air defense issue is, and be vigilant in their hearts at ordinary times. Then, air defense work will naturally be easy to organize and train. Once the war breaks out and enemy planes arrive, they will not be in a panic due to the lack of organization and training at ordinary times, and suffer serious damage. This is the significance of this air defense exhibition held by the Association. I hope that the general public will not ignore it."</p>
<h3 id="e84">Songjiang: Villagers Plead for the Cancellation of the Telegraph Bureau Land Grab Case <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Changqiao Street in Xinzhuang Town, which belongs to the county, has recently enclosed and buried 300 mu of land for the construction of a telegraph bureau. Upon hearing the news, the local farmers were panicked. On the 5th, more than 400 people gathered and went to the district office to petition District Chief Chen, requesting that he revoke the order. After District Chief Chen repeatedly comforted them, the farmers dispersed after demanding a definite reply. It is reported that the telegraph bureau was originally located in Shanghai Middle School in Lujiabang, Shanghai. After Shanghai moved to govern, Shanghai Middle School enclosed 500 mu of land in Beiqiao for construction, at 200 yuan per mu. As a result, the bureau lost its residence. After finding Changqiao Town in the county as needed for the construction of the bureau, it was submitted to the Ministry of Communications and forwarded to the Ministry of Interior for approval to enclose the land. However, the farmers in the area are all self-cultivating, and their families depend on it for their livelihoods. Even if the state gives preferential land prices, the farmers will not be able to change their jobs to maintain their livelihoods. It is heard that the land of 300 mu to be enclosed involves the ownership of more than 200 people. Once it is enclosed, each household with five members will immediately lose their jobs, reaching more than 1,000 people. It is heard that the general villagers said that if there is no definite solution, they would rather be broken jade than broken tiles.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, recently, due to the urgent need for funds, specially instructed County Magistrate Wang of this county to collect 440,000 yuan in new and old land taxes during the cocoon season. After County Magistrate Wang received the order, he specially instructed Zhu Kaiguan, the head of land taxes, to strictly pursue the taxes. Yesterday (6th) afternoon at 3:00, he summoned the tax collection officials and all the chief clerks of the county to give a speech, stating that the old taxes from the 16th to 21st years of the Republic of China should be investigated and collected from household to household and urged strictly. After this announcement of the time limit, everyone must follow the assigned numbers, actively urge the collection, and hand in the taxes on time.

<p>Wan Bingcheng, the Chief Clerk of the General Office of the Three Vaults in Jiangdu, because County Magistrate Ma worked hard to urge the collection of new and old arrears, and because of the repeated droughts in the northwest countryside, the people's debts were not easy to collect, the market was bleak, and the officials' debts were even more difficult to clear. Yesterday (4th), the day before the Dragon Boat Festival, the library limit was 1,000 yuan today (5th). Recently, he said to his deputy chief clerk, Zhao Yujiu, that he was going out to find a solution, and if it was not as he wished, he would commit suicide by jumping into the river and be done with it. Yesterday morning at about 8:00, he disappeared. Soon, a letter from the chief clerk to Zhao Yujiu was delivered by the post office. The letter lamented the difficulties of public and private affairs and stated that he could not stay in the world any longer. He asked them to remember their old friendship and have pity on his family. At about 10:00, his younger brother, Wan Wu, also disappeared. On the 5th, it was suddenly reported that Wan had taken a car to Liuwei, and then jumped into the river in between, and that a body was found in Xinhe Bay. The truth remains to be verified.

<p>Wenxi Town in Cixi East Township is more than ten miles away from Cicheng, and cars can reach it directly. Last night at 9:00, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the village, all holding wooden guns and other weapons. They first surrounded the Wenxi Security Regiment headquarters and seized the weapons, including four rifles and one pistol. The regiment only had one squad leader and four soldiers. They resisted for a while, but were outnumbered and were eventually disarmed. The squad leader was wounded by a gunshot, and one civilian was injured by a stray bullet. After the bandits seized the weapons of the Security Regiment, they robbed the grocery store opened by Chen, the deputy township chief. Because there was not much to steal, they also tied up Deputy Township Chief Chen. The Zhuangqiao Branch of the Public Security Bureau is thirty miles away from Wenxi. After receiving the report, Chief He Peiqiang personally led a large team of police to Changshiqiao to investigate. The Cixi County Public Security Bureau has also sent a large team to pursue the bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e89">After the Government's All-Out Relief, Silver and Money Businesses All Pass the Festival Threshold Steadily <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Management Committee Reviewed the Collateral of Various Money Shops Yesterday; The National Goods Alliance Visited Xu Kan to Petition for Relief; The Ministry of Finance Restricted the Import of Banknote Paper</p>
<p>After the end of the lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival (also known as the Summer Festival), silver and money businesses resumed normal operations yesterday morning. The financial turmoil has subsided after the government made every effort to stabilize it. The Money Business Supervision Committee held a meeting to review the collateral of various shops. The National Goods Great Alliance visited Finance Vice Minister Xu Kan to petition for relief. The Ministry of Finance, in order to solemnly issue banknotes, restricted the import of banknote paper. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Financial Stability, Turmoil Subsides</p>
<p>The financial turmoil in Shanghai has subsided since the Minister of Finance, Kong Xiangxi, consulted with financial leaders to stabilize the situation, and allocated 25 million yuan in financial public bonds to relieve the money businesses. The market is stable, and public confidence is gradually returning. Savings deposits in the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Four Banks Savings, Salt Industry Bank, Silk Industry Bank, and Shanghai Bank have increased sharply. The interbank lending rate in the money market was 18% both in the morning and afternoon sessions. However, the premium for borrowing with guaranteed collateral remained at a peak of 70%.</p>
<p>Ministry Orders Restriction on Import of Banknote Paper</p>
<p>In order to solemnly issue banknotes, the Ministry of Finance restricted the import of banknote paper. Yesterday, it specially instructed the Bankers' Association and other organizations, stating, "The paper used for printing banknotes is extremely important for issuance. In order to prevent the private issuance of banknotes, any printing business that purchases banknote paper in the future must first submit it to the Ministry for approval, and then entrust the Central Bank Trust Bureau to purchase it on its behalf. We have already ordered all customs offices that, in the future, any banknote paper imported that is not purchased by the Central Bank Trust Bureau should be detained in its entirety and submitted to the Ministry for review, and should not be released without authorization. In addition to notifying the Central Bank and issuing separate orders, the Chamber of Commerce is hereby ordered to immediately inform all printing businesses to comply accordingly."</p>
<p>Wang Yansong Visits Kong Song Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, supervisor of the Bank of China, who was appointed by the Ministry of Finance as a specialist member of the Financial Reorganization Committee, visited Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen yesterday to discuss relief loans for industry and commerce and measures to reorganize finances. Kong went to the Central Bank to work at 5 pm yesterday and was very busy.</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Reviews Collateral</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance allocated public bonds to relieve the money businesses, the member shops of the Money Business Association submitted their collateral, such as title deeds, public bonds, and goods, to the Supervisory Committee in accordance with the valuation standards of the Supervisory Committee, and applied to receive relief public bonds. The committee held a meeting at 10 am yesterday in the money business reserve of Ningbo Road to review the collateral of various shops. Xu Kan, Wang Xiaofan, Du Yuesheng, Gu Yigu, Qin Runqing, and others did not leave until after 11 am. They immediately distributed the financial public bonds deposited in the Central Bank to various shops, and at the same time deposited the collateral in the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Real Estate Association Expresses Opinions</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association believes that land deeds account for the first place among the collateral of money businesses, and the valuation relationship is important. On the 4th, they sent a letter to the Money Business Supervisory Committee, stating, "To whom it may concern, Shanghai money businesses have recently been affected by the decline of all industries, resulting in difficult turnover. On June 3rd, the Ministry of Finance, in order to relieve industry and commerce and stabilize finances, prepared 25 million yuan in financial public bonds to maintain the situation. At the same time, the Money Business Association submitted a list of various collateral to your committee for review. It is found that land deeds rank first in the collateral part, with a huge amount. The valuation problem is very important. Since the Shanghai real estate market has been sluggish since the January 28th Incident, there have been few transactions. However, the actual decline is no more than 70% to 80% of the highest market price. When money businesses accepted real estate as collateral in the past, they did not calculate according to the market price, but mostly based on the valuation of the title deed, which was stable whether the amount was high or low. However, the world economic panic has affected Shanghai, resulting in a sudden shortage of chips. Money businesses are eager to turnover, and some have re-pledged real estate collateral to banks, with valuations only half or less of the title deed valuation, and the value of the above-ground buildings is even ignored. This is a temporary abnormal situation and does not hold real value. Moreover, Shanghai is the first commercial port in East Asia, and its future development will definitely not be a complete failure. Your committee supervises the money business, and the collateral valuation is of great importance. We intend to ask you to maintain it, and use 70% of the land deed as collateral, and also value the above-ground buildings together, in order to maintain the market and stabilize people's hearts. We hope that you will adopt this."</p>
<p>Various Shops Study Fundamental Solutions</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance allocated public bonds to relieve the member shops of the Money Business Association, the money shops that passed the collateral review yesterday have received public bonds for adjustment. If they need cash, they can go to the Central Bank of Shanghai, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China-South Bank, Continental Bank, Jincheng Bank, Salt Industry Bank, Silk Industry Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, National Goods Bank, National China Bank, and other banks to pledge the public bonds for 60% of the cash, which is handled in accordance with the ordinary cash pledge method. It is heard that various shops believe that public bond relief is a temporary solution, and now they have jointly studied fundamental solutions, such as business reform.</p>
<p>National Goods Great Alliance Petitions</p>
<p>Representatives of the Shanghai National Goods Great Alliance Committee, Gu Xiyuan, Lu Xingzhuang, and Chen Yiting, went to the Central Bank yesterday morning at 10 am to visit Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, petitioning for the implementation of loans to relieve industry and commerce. However, because Kong was not there, they changed to go again at 3 pm. They were received by Executive Vice Minister Xu Keting. The representatives stated that many of the factories of their members are experiencing a shortage of turnover, and have filled out forms to the association, requesting that efforts be made to promote mortgages and credit loans for relief. Xu said that the Ministry of Finance has handed over the ten principles for issuing loans to the Silver and Money Association to be handled jointly by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Shanghai Bank. You can inquire about the methods from Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Bankers' Association, and Qin Runqing, chairman of the Money Business Association. As for the factories requesting relief and filling out forms, you can send these forms for a look. In the future, you can also discuss the implementation methods with you at any time. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Visits to Chen and Qin Scheduled for This Morning</p>
<p>After returning to the association, the representatives Gu Xiyuan, Lu Xingzhuang, and Chen Yiting immediately decided to prepare letters to visit Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Silver Business Association, and Qin Runqing, chairman of the Money Business Association, at 10 am today to inquire about the progress of mortgage loans and credit loans. The association has prepared these letters yesterday so that the three representatives can take the letters out of the association this morning.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves Factory Joint Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Joint Association previously requested its member factories to make efforts to promote factory mortgage loans. The association's standing committee member Zhang Zilian and others submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, stating the situation and applying. Yesterday, they received approval document No. 5656 from the Ministry of Finance, stating, "Your report is known. The ten principles regarding the relief of Shanghai industry and commerce loans have been sent to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Bankers' Association, and Money Business Association to be handled jointly. You should contact them directly for handling." This is the approval.</p>
<p>Two Banks Have Handled the Aftermath</p>
<p>(1) After the Shanghai Jiangnan Bank suspended business for liquidation, the entrusted accountant Shen Jiazhen has begun liquidation. At the same time, he is holding a creditors' meeting. Those who have registered with the accounting firm in recent days, calculated based on the amount of deposits, are about more than 10,000 yuan. (2) After the Ningbo Industrial Bank suspended business, the entrusted accountant Xu Yongzuo went to the bank's head office yesterday to handle liquidation. After General Manager Wu Zhihao left Shanghai passively, it was learned by a reporter from the New Sound Society that he was in Hangzhou. Also, the savings departments established by the two banks have paid one-quarter of the reserve to the Reserve Custody Committee in accordance with Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Creditors Oppose Liquidation</p>
<p>The creditors of Shanghai National Goods Company, Tianfu, Dashengfu, Silk and Satin Bureau, etc., operated by Wu Zhihao, formed a joint creditor group and entrusted lawyers Jiang Baoli and Wu Zhengkui to issue a notice stating, "According to the above-mentioned two creditor groups, Fukang Dafeng Silk Shop and other 65 companies, representatives came to our office and claimed that Tianfu and Dashengfu Silk and Satin Bureau Joint Branch and Shanghai National Goods Company, etc., owe this shop and other goods worth more than 100,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, just as the Summer Festival was about to collect payments, Tianfu and Shanghai National Goods Company suddenly announced liquidation. Although Dashengfu is continuing to operate, it refuses to pay the debt it should be responsible for. In this autumn of the decline of the silk industry, it is unbearable to suffer night rain on a leaky house. Therefore, on June 4, a joint meeting of the two creditor groups was held at the Shangzhang Silk Industry Association. Representatives from 66 shops attended, with a total debt of more than 110,000 yuan. In addition to forming a joint creditor group and entrusting your lawyers to recover according to law, they also published a notice in the newspaper, expressing opposition to the liquidation of the bureau, etc., and requesting the bureau, etc., to pay in full. If there are still those in the same industry who have not joined, they can quickly register at the office of this group in the Silk and Satin Industry Association of Sanma Road, and the amount of debt will be handled together, in order to achieve the effect of collective efforts, etc." Based on this, a joint statement is made as above.</p>
<p>National Goods Company Employees Petition</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty employees of the Shanghai National Goods Company organized an employee aftercare association, requesting the return of savings deposits and this month's salary. Representatives have been sent to contact lawyer Wang Fuxun (Wang is the temporary manager of Shanghai National Goods Company) in recent days, but to no avail. According to the employee representatives, the Shanghai National Goods Company opened in November 1932 and will be four years old this year. Mr. Wu Zhihao has devoted his life to the national goods business, and his contribution to society is commendable. In this recessionary trend, he suffered a tragic failure, which was really forced by the environment. Mr. Wu only carried 1,000 yuan when he left this time, and has no assets. The situation is very pitiful. However, the savings deposits deducted from us employees over the years have accumulated to a total of 5,000 yuan, and this month's salary, even if calculated on a half-month basis, can also get 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. However, once the business is suspended, no money is available. The company has been responsible for recording someone. Yesterday, the employee aftercare association specially sent representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, and the director of the mediation department, Wang Xianqing, received them and promised to investigate and verify.</p>
<p>Many Wanguo Savers Still Pledged Their Certificates</p>
<p>Various savers of the Wanguo Savings Association have pledged their certificates to the association for loans or withdrawals. After the turmoil occurred, although the association prepared a large amount of cash, extended office hours, and made every effort to accept and receive in accordance with the regulations, the number of savers who pledged or withdrew their certificates yesterday morning was slightly less than the first day, but it was still crowded. The French Concession patrol room specially dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western patrol officers to maintain order. Savers holding certificates were allowed to enter in batches, otherwise they were rejected.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Shipping Industry Cables Chairman Jiang to Quickly Issue Public Bonds for Relief; More Than Ten Ships Have Been Abandoned and Stopped by the Industry; If the Government Does Not Provide Relief Again, the Danger of Ruin Is Imminent <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association cables Chairman Jiang, etc., saying, "To Chengdu Chairman Jiang, Nanjing Executive Yuan, National Economic Council, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Communications, In recent years, the shipping industry in our country has been extremely declining. Recently, it has been affected by the market situation, and the situation is critical. We respectfully state the reasons as follows: (1) Rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial decline, less freight, sharp reduction in freight rates; (2) Financial tightness, silver and money industries are preoccupied with their own affairs, loans are cut off, and there is no way to turnover; (3) All expenses must be paid in cash, and income is calculated on a periodic basis, and daily expenses cannot be offset; (4) The price of Japanese coal in Dalian is six yuan per ton, and the price of Chinese coal is twelve yuan per ton. The coal used by Japanese ships has already reduced expenses by half compared with Chinese ships. Also, for all ship hardware, Dalian does not levy donations and taxes. The wages of ship employees are 20% to 30% less than in Shanghai. Also, because the Japanese gold exchange rate is low, it can save 40% compared with Chinese gangs. If Chinese ship companies set up offices in Dalian, all expenses will be saved, and Japanese ships can be reduced again. Moreover, there are Japanese government subsidies or guaranteed dividends. In this comparison, Chinese ships are even more difficult. With these points, they are trapped in a desperate situation. If this continues, in addition to bankruptcy and suspension of navigation, there is really no way to make a plan. In this position, the failure of shipping merchants is not mentioned. However, a large number of sailors are unemployed as a result, and the emperor is worried. Once you think about it, it is really endless and thrilling. Now, in the industry, due to the inability to maintain, there are more than ten ships that have been abandoned and stopped. After that, the inevitable trend is to stop the shift. The duties and feelings of the association have to make the final appeal. In the 19th year, it was reported to the government to issue shipping public bonds to save shipping merchants. Although it was reviewed and approved, it has not been implemented. In these five years, shipping merchants have tried their best to survive. Now in this environment, the urgent situation is no longer comparable to the past. If the government does not provide relief again, the danger of ruin is imminent, and the catastrophe is inevitable. It is compelled to report to the top, and must add insight, and must be able to visit and approve the original case requested by the association to advance the issuance of 10 million yuan of shipping public bonds to save Chinese ships. The shipping merchants' only chance of survival depends on this move. Otherwise, the shipping merchants will have no way to go, and they will only sit and wait to die. I beg you to consider and approve the speedy implementation. The commission is eagerly awaiting orders. Chairman Yu Hede of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association bows his head."</p>

(8) Determine the chairman of the second Standing Committee Resolution: Recommend the City Chamber of Commerce as the chairman of the second Standing Committee.</p>
<p>Submissions and Telegrams</p>
<p>The telegram from the association to the government reads, "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Central Political Conference, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Wang and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman Chen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Since the news of the Siamese government's oppression of overseas Chinese spread at home and abroad, Chinese people were enraged when they heard about it. China and Siam were originally brotherly countries, and both were established by agriculture. The characteristics of race and religion are similar to each other. From a historical and geographical point of view, they are as dependent on each other as auxiliary vehicles and share weal and woe. At this time when the world is uneasy, in order to maintain peace in East Asia, all our small and weak nations should unite in spirit and help each other in the same boat. However, the Siamese government does not do this, but regards our overseas Chinese as easy to deal with, and promulgates various harsh laws, destroying them at all costs. The ambitious ones want to assimilate our millions of overseas Chinese in Siam and then be happy. The seriousness of the situation is greater than this. Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution, as the late Premier said long ago. Now, although our country has been unified internally and the bandit troubles will also be eliminated, even the unequal treaties are waiting to be abolished. In the future, if we want to revive the nation, we need more overseas Chinese, and we must not ignore it. Moreover, the Siam case is not a simple problem of overseas Chinese themselves, but is related to the survival of the entire country and nation. The Shanghai community is wary of the severe frost and firm ice, and dare not remain silent. Therefore, in the month of falling into Japan, the Shanghai Association for Aiding Overseas Chinese in Siam was organized. Its only purpose is to promote the reflection of the Siamese government. In addition to further uniting compatriots at home and abroad and rallying to support overseas Chinese in Siam, it is reasonable to earnestly ask your seat to set a policy as soon as possible, first establish formal national relations with the Siamese government. If the authorities are still insincere, please prohibit the import of Siamese rice, consult with local conditions, discuss appropriate methods, and implement them on a scheduled date. Then, the Siamese who are self-proclaimed and regard our country as a rice-producing market will eventually regret it. It is hoped that the overseas Chinese in Siam will not be trapped in the ungoverned horror for a long time, and will only be used as fish and meat. The former Yu of the National Zong ethnic group is fortunate and fortunate. The telegram is panicked and overwhelmed by the urgent waiting. The telegram to the central party headquarters, the regiment and the people's government of Shanghai, which was sent by the United Association of Compatriots Assisting Overseas Chinese in Siam, and the telegram to the provinces and cities and various newspapers throughout the country, reads: To the party headquarters, governments of the provinces and cities, associations at home and abroad, newspapers and magazines, schools, and newspapers, all Jian, recently reported to the central party headquarters, the regiment's folk government, the telegram said, (details of the above telegram) Before China and Siam have not signed a trade treaty, Siam's political storage has not improved the treatment of overseas Chinese, we should have effective methods of Siamese goods to deal with them, in order to force overseas Chinese to be relieved of their pain. Because the matter is of great importance, the collective efforts of the group are not effective. It is hoped that the party headquarters in various provinces and cities will be responsible for guiding, and the associations at home and abroad will rise up to support them. Please ask the government to negotiate sternly, or wake up compatriots to unite, which is not only to seek overseas Chinese who are in critical condition, but also to benefit the country and the people. Hereby, I express my condolences and hope for your consideration. The United Association of Compatriots Assisting Overseas Chinese in Siam bowed to the Ma,</p>

<p>The antiquities that our country is shipping to England to participate in the London Chinese Art International Exhibition were transferred from the warehouse of the Shanghai Office on Renji Road to the British ship Suffolk yesterday morning. The ship is scheduled to depart from the port at 7 am this morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned the details as follows:</p>
<p>British Ship Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The British ship Suffolk arrived in port the night before last. The Shanghai Office of the Association specially requested the state-run China Merchants Bureau to rent the wharf and pay one-tenth of the rent, totaling 79 yuan. That night, Mr. Tang Xifen, the secretary of the Association, inspected the ship for a week.</p>
<p>Antiquities Transported to the Ship</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Association hired the Movers Foreign Company's trucks and transported them to the China Merchants Bureau wharf twice with the escort of detectives. The first time, five trucks were used, and the second time, two trucks were used. All 93 boxes of antiquities were moved and safely entered the cabin. The luggage of Mr. Tang Xifen, the secretary of the Association, and Zhuang Shangyan, the section chief of the Ancient Palace Museum, who accompanied the antiquities to London, were also moved to the ship yesterday. However, Tang Zhuang will board the ship at 6 am this morning.</p>
<p>Banquet for Zheng Tang</p>
<p>Lei Zhen, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, hosted two banquets at the Meiyuan Restaurant on Sima Road yesterday noon. One was to send off Zheng Tianxi, Tang Xifen, and Zhuang Shangyan, the special envoys who accompanied the antiquities abroad this time, and the other was to thank everyone who assisted in holding the pre-exhibition in Shanghai last time, such as Liu Hongsheng, Li Jinpei, and Zhao Tiezhang, who were all invited.</p>
<p>Reception for the Captain</p>
<p>At 7 pm last night, Zheng Tianxi specially hosted a banquet at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road to connect with Wei Qing and entertain Captain Manners of the Suffolk, Commander Whitaker, and other senior officers, including Perrot, one of the five British envoys specially sent to China to select antiquities. The other four British envoys went to Japan a few days ago and returned to England via the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Western Press Reports: 美豐 Bank Liquidation Incident <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>美豐 Bank Has 8,000 Depositors of 40 Nationalities / 普益 Has Not Closed and Is Operating as Usual</p>
<p>The 大陸報 reports that Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of 美豐 Bank, 美東 银公司, and 普益 银公司, has hired Dr. Xue Laite, a former American local magistrate in China now practicing law, as the legal advisor to the liquidator. He has also hired Mr. De Fute to audit the accounts of the three companies. Mr. De will begin work with his team of auditors this morning (6th). Once the audit is complete, he will report to Mr. Xi Ermike, the Chief Justice of the American Court. A 大陸報 representative met with Mr. He Fu, the former manager of 美豐 Bank, in his office yesterday afternoon. Mr. He Fu was very busy and had met with Mr. De Fute and Mr. Ya Liangman, a lawyer representing the American creditors and some depositors of the three companies. According to Mr. He, he cannot yet predict the date when the repayments to depositors will begin, but he will announce it as soon as possible to satisfy public expectations. The repayments, regardless of the amount of the deposit, will be made on a pro rata basis. Most of the assets of the three companies are in real estate. The liquidator has the power to sell this real estate for cash to repay the depositors. However, the current value of real estate is only half of what it used to be. Many real estate holders fear that the sale of all the real estate of the two companies will have a serious impact on the Shanghai real estate market. However, an American official told a 大陳報 reporter yesterday that this concern is unwarranted. In the past five or six years, Shanghai real estate prices have soared and reached their peak. If the real estate of the three companies is sold at current prices, the market will be more stable than it was during the abnormal price surge in the past. Yesterday, the main entrance of 美豐 Bank on Nanjing Road remained locked and guarded by the police. Letters and newspapers were scattered on the ground inside the main entrance. The seals on the second floor had been removed, and all the rooms were empty. Only Mr. He Fu occupied one room, assisted by a stenographer. 美豐 Bank has a total of 8,000 depositors of 40 nationalities, with total deposits of over 8 million yuan. Its capital is 550,000 US dollars and 1.25 million Chinese yuan. Last year's profit was just under 600,000 yuan. The assets of the above three companies, including those of the 普益 Land Company, are estimated to be between 60 and 70 million yuan.</p>
<p>The 字林報 reports that Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of 美豐 Bank and the other two companies, spent all day yesterday in the bank's office discussing liquidation matters with local financial authorities. He has also hired Mr. De Fute as an auditor. Mr. De will begin auditing the bank's accounts with his staff at 9:00 this morning (6th). Mr. He Fu told reporters last night that he plans to issue a detailed announcement to reassure the public when the audit is nearing completion. However, this will take some time, so he asks depositors and shareholders to be patient.</p>
<p>The 大美晚報 reports that Mr. Xi Ermike has appointed Mr. He Fu as the temporary custodian of 普益 Land Company this morning, pending investigation of whether the company can be reorganized or whether it will be decided that the company will continue to operate under the management of the custodian. Because the company's affairs are intertwined with those of other companies, it is more convenient for Mr. He Fu to serve as the temporary custodian for the progress of affairs. According to the application for the appointment of a custodian, the assets listed on the company's books as of December 31, 1934, were worth 22,181,907.48 yuan, but the actual value is now much lower than this. The amount of liabilities on the same day was 20,937,913.20 yuan.  Note that 普益 Land Company is different from the other three companies and has not been closed. It is operating as usual during negotiations with the American court. A Reuters Shanghai dispatch on the 6th reports that an employee of Citibank in this city stated today that recent rumors that the bank is financially related to 美豐 Bank are false. In fact, Citibank has never had any financial or other relationship with 美豐 Bank or 普益 银公司. Furthermore, Citibank is not a participant or founder of any other commercial firm or organization in China.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Yangtze River Six Companies Alliance: Implementing Public Sharing of Freight <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Formal Contract Signed / Implementation on July 1st / Valid for Six Months</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign shipping companies have negotiated to form an alliance for Yangtze River shipping and further implement public sharing of business. This matter is of great importance. 太古, 怡和, 招商, 三北, 寗紹, and other shipping companies have held numerous meetings and discussions on this matter for several months. The discussion of public sharing methods and the consideration of various conditions have caused delays. Only yesterday did the representatives of the companies sign the alliance and public sharing agreement, approving its implementation on July 1st. This matter is of great importance to the Yangtze River shipping industry. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Six-Company Alliance</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Shipping Alliance was originally planned to include seven companies: 太古, 怡和, 招商, 寗紹, 三北, 日淸, and the American 捷江 Company, which also requested to join and was accepted by the shipping companies. However, 捷江 Shipping focuses on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and its business on the Shanghai-Hankou route is very small. Therefore, it declared that it would no longer join the Yangtze River public sharing. Thus, it is now publicly agreed that the alliance consists of six companies.</p>
<p>Signing the Agreement</p>
<p>The six companies have convened meetings to discuss the public sharing issue for four or five months. The companies believe that excessive business competition and plummeting freight rates can only be remedied by working together to eliminate the long-standing problems of rampant rate cutting and excessive commissions. Therefore, it was agreed that the six companies would publicly share their Yangtze River business to make up for each other's deficiencies. However, due to the large number of ships, it took several surveys to determine the current tonnage of the six companies' ships. Then, based on the ships owned by each company, a public sharing contract was drafted. Only on the 5th of this month did the representatives of the six companies formally sign the agreement.</p>
<p>Overview of the Measures</p>
<p>The six-company alliance's method involves determining the net tonnage of each company's current Yangtze River ships by testing, deducting the non-cargo tonnage from the total tonnage. The companies' freight revenue, after deducting discounts and commissions, will be used as the official rate. The official rate will be based on the net freight per ship per trip and the loading capacity. For example, if the loading capacity of each ship per trip is less than 50% of the net tonnage, then 50% of the loading capacity will be added, and then multiplied by the official rate to obtain the public sharing score to determine the freight fee that the company should receive for that ship. If the loading capacity of each ship per trip is more than 50% of the net tonnage, then 50% of the non-loading capacity will be added, and then multiplied by the official rate to obtain the public sharing score to determine the freight fee that the company should receive for that ship. In simple terms, for example, for a 1,000-ton ship, 500 tons of cargo is the standard. If more is loaded, it must be shared; if less than 500 tons is loaded, it will be compensated by ships that carry more. With this method, Yangtze River ships will never compete for more cargo.</p>
<p>Six-Month Trial</p>
<p>After the agreement was signed, the six companies agreed to implement it from July 1st. The implementation period is tentatively set for six months. If it is effective, the six companies unanimously agree to continue, then the effective period can be extended.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Ministry of Justice Instructs Jiangsu High Court to Rectify Judicial Ethics <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Duty of Judges Is to Expose Illegal Activities / They Themselves Should Be Pure, Noble, and Above Reproach</p>
<p>The Second and Third Branch Courts of the Jiangsu High Court received instructions from the Ministry of Justice yesterday, stating: "Judicial officials hold the nation's constitution and preside over the fairness of trials. The purity or corruption of politics and the well-being of the people depend on them. How should they cultivate integrity and uphold righteousness to rectify discipline? However, upon investigation, most of the prosecutors and inspectors at all levels are able to perform their duties honestly and legally, but there are also not a few who are accustomed to old habits and do not strive to improve themselves. Therefore, a small number of bad elements often tarnish the reputation of the entire legal community. The courts, on which the people rely for the protection of their lives, property, freedom, and rights, cannot gain their firm belief. What a pity! Since taking office, the Minister has repeatedly admonished officials throughout the country with the four words 'honesty, clarity, diligence, and caution,' believing that the position of a judge is so noble that even this minimum requirement is unattainable. Truly, one should be ashamed to death. After several months of observation, although the patching-up is more skillful and the exposure is less frequent, judging from the unevenness of the case details and the dissatisfaction of public opinion, the decisions are questionable and the integrity is untrustworthy, often coming to attention. This is due to the Minister's lack of virtue and ability, and the inadequacy of his leadership. In the future, he should cultivate himself more and strive to influence others, and also because the system of evaluation and the method of supervision are not strict, making it so. Recently, the Supervisors of the Supervision Districts of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai have been specially appointed by the National Government and will go to their posts in Beijing soon to exercise their powers. They see the central government's great intention to rectify discipline, examine the competence of officials, inspect provinces and counties, and ask about the people's suffering. It is hoped that all officials at all levels will share this intention, sharpen their spirits, encourage each other, and not fail this good opportunity for the implementation of the supervisory system to the local level, and resolutely start anew with the people. The President and Chief Prosecutor of the Court bear the heavy responsibility entrusted to them by the Ministry and should supervise their subordinates closely. They should set an example, work together with pure hearts, be respectful in their positions, and diligently realize the principle of the separation of powers with the spirit of the rule of law. Indeed, the duty of a judge is to expose or restrain the illegal actions of the people, and they themselves should be pure, noble, and no longer subject to criticism. If they do not respect themselves and there are illegal or derelict acts, and the Supervisors find them and file impeachment, their responsibility should be considered more serious than that of other officials. The Minister has always advocated that to govern the law, one must first govern people, and to correct things, one must first correct oneself. In this case, he will definitely punish them severely according to the law, without the slightest leniency. You should immediately comply, restrain yourselves, and instruct your subordinates to follow suit. This order is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3 id="e102">貞 Character - 福泰 Money Exchange Ceases Operations <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Entrusting Lawyers Ling Menglin and Zhou Shiying to Liquidate / No Relationship with Another 福泰 匯庄</p>
<p>The 新聲社 reports that 福泰 Money Exchange, marked with the character 貞 in this city, has ceased operations due to financial difficulties. The lawyers have been entrusted to liquidate the assets. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ceasing Operations for Liquidation.  順泰 Small Money Exchange, located at 501 Sichuan Road, specializes in the exchange of secret notes and door-to-door exchanges, as well as deposits and withdrawals. The manager, Wang Shouqian, is now unable to recover the money lent out due to the influence of the market, making it impossible to maintain operations. It has ceased operations for liquidation since the morning before yesterday. The total amount of deposits is approximately 80,000 yuan. Its creditors, Zhan Fengqin and 中歐 匯兌莊, have declared their opposition to the liquidation. The 新聲社 reporter notes that there is another money exchange in Shanghai with the same name, 福泰 匯划莊 in Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road.  It is a member of the Money Exchange Association and has no relationship with this 福泰 Exchange marked with the character 貞.</p>
<p>Lawyers' Notice. Lawyers Dai Menglin and Zhou Shiying, representing 福泰 Money Exchange, announced the cessation of operations for liquidation. According to the statement of the person in charge of 福泰 Money Exchange, due to the impact of the current economic downturn, its turnover is not working well, making it impossible to maintain operations. Therefore, they have been forced to entrust the lawyers to announce the liquidation. Therefore, we hereby announce on behalf of the involved parties that all creditors of the exchange should bring their vouchers to the office for registration within fourteen days from the date of this announcement in order to facilitate verification and repayment. Failure to do so within the deadline will be considered a waiver of the claim. Debtors of the exchange are also required to repay the debts in full within the aforementioned deadline, otherwise they will be prosecuted according to the law. Please do not be mistaken. This announcement is hereby made for your information. June 5, 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Urging Literacy Movement <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Warning to Organizations That Have Not Established Literacy Schools / Holding Oral Exams for Literacy School Teachers</p>
<p>The 國民社 reports that the City Party Headquarters is promoting literacy education in the city. In addition to ordering all levels of Party Headquarters to establish literacy schools, it has also ordered all organizations in the city to prepare literacy schools within the specified time limit. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that all levels of Party Headquarters regard literacy schools as important to the Party's literacy movement, so they are actively preparing. Most organizations also understand the painstaking efforts of the city's Party and government agencies, so they are doing their best. Most have applied to the City Party Headquarters for registration or entrusted it to handle the matter on their behalf. However, a small number of organizations have not reported, either because their own organization is unsound, or they are still in the process of preparing, or the person in charge is busy and has no time to carry it out, or they are taking a wait-and-see attitude. The City Party Headquarters believes that these organizations have violated the regulations, so it has issued a warning and set a deadline for preparation. At the same time, in order to handle literacy schools on behalf of the organizations, it has held a teacher registration for literacy schools and held oral exams yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Warning to Organizations. "Regarding the warning, it has been investigated that in the case of promoting literacy education, this Committee previously drafted two types of measures: Measures for Establishing Literacy Schools by Various Organizations and Implementation Measures. It has been jointly ordered by the Social Bureau to all organizations to comply with them. Later, a report form was created, and it was ordered that it be filled out and reported within a time limit. However, the deadline has passed, and there has been no compliance or explanation of the reasons. This is considered negligence. A warning is hereby issued, and it is ordered that preparations be made quickly within two weeks from today and that a report be submitted. If there is further delay, the provisions of Article 13 of the Implementation Measures will be dealt with, and there will be no leniency. Be cautious and do not neglect. (The rest of the warning is omitted)."</p>
<p>Teacher Oral Exams. Yesterday (6th) at 9:00 a.m., the City Party Headquarters held oral exams for literacy school teachers at the Mass Education Center on Wenmiao Road. More than 300 candidates arrived. The City Party Headquarters Literacy Education Promotion Association sent cadres Huang Tiren, Tu Longzhang, Yang Jialin, and others to administer the exams. They asked in detail about the literacy education being carried out in the city and the teaching methods to be used in the future, as well as the teaching principles to be adopted in normal times. The exams were completed at 12:00 p.m. The list of those admitted will be officially announced tomorrow. At the same time, each admitted person will be directly notified. A briefing for those admitted will be held on the 10th. Teachers who are not admitted can collect their documents by presenting the original receipt.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Revisiting an Old Issue: Preparing a Public Funeral for Zhao Tieqiao <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Asks the Executive Yuan to Investigate / Burial in Hangzhou or Nanjing Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>The late Zhao Tieqiao, member of the Construction Committee and commissioner for reorganizing the China Merchants Bureau, was shot and killed in front of the bureau gate on the morning of July 24, 19th year. The National Government ordered commendation and a public funeral was decided by the Central Standing Committee. Later, at the request of the family to bury him in Hangzhou, the Zhejiang Provincial Government was instructed accordingly. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has not yet determined the burial site in Hangzhou, so it has been delayed until now. The remains are still stored in the International Cemetery. Recently, when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Chengdu, his brother Zhao Tiexie happened to be in Sichuan. He asked Chairman Chiang to telegraph President Wang of the Executive Yuan to investigate the case and handle it. Some relatives and friends advocated burial in the capital. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chiang's Telegram to Wang. "To President Wang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing: It is reported by Zhao Tiexie that his late brother Tieqiao was assassinated while serving as a commissioner in the China Merchants Bureau. The National Government, in memory of his meritorious service, ordered commendation, and a public funeral was decided by the Central Standing Committee, and the National Government was consulted for implementation. Five years have passed, and it has not yet been held. I urge you to ask the National Government to order the competent authorities to investigate the proposal and hold a public funeral on a regular basis, and to strictly arrest the perpetrators, bring them to justice, and investigate. Zhao, the former commissioner, served the revolution with loyalty and unwavering determination. After taking office in the China Merchants Bureau, he implemented the doctrine and tried to nationalize it. His dedication and courage were particularly commendable. Therefore, the Ministry took over the Bureau in the 21st year, all based on Zhao's past plans. Zhao was hated by the villains because of this, and eventually died for his country. It is truly sad and worthy of praise to encourage others. I am forwarding his brother's original report and hope that you will remember his loyal soul and investigate the case and handle it. Your brother Zhongzheng bows in Jiangmiyu."</p>
<p>Burial Site Undecided. President Wang has sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate the case and quickly determine the location of the public funeral. Zhao's brother Tieqian also came to Nanjing and Hangzhou from Sichuan and met with President Wang and Chairman Huang, which were very satisfactory. Once the Zhejiang Provincial Government has designated the Hangzhou location, it can be reported to the Central Government for a regular date. Some other relatives and friends of Zhao advocate that the funeral be held in the capital because the recent funeral of Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission Chairman Shi Qingyang (Shi and Zhao were also close friends during their lifetime) was a public funeral in the capital. Therefore, Central Committee member Liao Zhongkai will also be reburied in the capital from Guangdong. It is expected that Mrs. Zhao, Ms. Huang Shenyi, will make the final decision.</p>

<p>The International Astronomical Conference is being held in Paris, France this year. Major countries in Europe and the United States have sent representatives to attend. China has also been invited. The Central Observatory has appointed Gao Jun as the representative to attend. Mr. Gao arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday and purchased a passenger ticket on the Conte Verde of the Italian Post Company. He is scheduled to depart for France today. Singaporean Consul Shi Shaozeng and his wife are also taking the Italian Post ship to Singapore today to take up their new posts.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Mystery Surrounding Seaman He Baosheng's Death: Union to Negotiate Strictly with Company <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the China Seamen's Union has recently received a report from the family of He Baosheng, a Chinese seaman on the 英商 老太古 Company's 萊克西拿 ship, regarding the discovery of his body on the ocean surface. It will begin active negotiations to secure generous compensation for the family of the deceased in order to fulfill its responsibility to protect them. At the same time, it is actively investigating the truth of He Baosheng's death in order to obtain the facts before proceeding. He Baosheng was a coppersmith on the 萊克西拿 ship. His body was found on the ocean surface near Nafu in the United States on June 11th of last year. The causes of death were rumored to be various. Some said that he was murdered and his body was thrown into the sea to cover up the crime. Others said that he was addicted to gambling and committed suicide due to debt. Therefore, the truth remains to be investigated. The rumors are not credible. The 萊克西拿 ship arrived in Shanghai once on May 18th of this year. Prior to that, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau had received an order to investigate, and the Secretariat of the Municipal Government had sent a letter to the union for assistance. When the ship arrived, the detective team sent personnel to meet with the Seamen's Union to wait at the dock. They boarded the ship and called out the seamen from the engine room and stokehold to inquire. There were no suspicious points. The detective team members then took four people to the team: the stokehold foreman Tu Decai, the seaman foreman Jiang Fucai, the stoker Chen Yuebei, and the seaman Le A'er. Those arrested, including Tu Decai, were purely good people. Since being arrested, the seafarer groups in this city have risen up to rescue them. Furthermore, because the 萊克西拿 ship was about to sail, they could not stay ashore for long, resulting in their dismissal by the company. Subsequently, the Yan Ying General Agency and other seafarer groups jointly petitioned the union to provide bail. For the sake of caution, the union first sent personnel to ask the detective team about the reasons for the detention. It was learned that it was for the purpose of inquiry, not arrest. It then moved them to the union for questioning. However, after strict questioning, they did not know anything about He Baosheng's death and could not be suspected. It was also found that the ship was indeed scheduled to sail the next day (21st). In order to avoid innocent people being implicated, it agreed to the request of the seafarer groups and allowed the four people, Tu Decai, to be released on bail and return to the ship to await investigation. They were released on bail and returned to the ship on the 10th of last month. The guarantors were the Yan Ying General Agency and other five seafarer groups in this city, as well as the Shanghai National Trade Company. They all signed a guarantee and deposited it with the union, assuming all responsibility for Tu Decai, etc. Since the family of the deceased has petitioned the union to handle the matter, it will not be difficult to find out the truth after the union investigates He Baosheng's murder or suicide, and the issue of compensation for the family of the deceased will certainly have a satisfactory result.</p>

<h3 id="e107">French Gift of Books to the Oriental Library; Presentation Ceremony Held Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>More than Two Hundred Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries Attended; French Consul-General Presented Books; Chu Minyi and Others Delivered Speeches; Over a Thousand Volumes to be Exhibited Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The French Philanthropic Society's donation of 1,600 French books to the Oriental Library was celebrated yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM with a presentation ceremony held in the grand auditorium of the French Municipal Council, located at 11 Avenue des Soeurs. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>Attendees at yesterday's ceremony included Chu Minyi, representing Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government; Hong Kui, representing Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai; Cai Yuanpei; Li Shizeng; Paul Pelliot; Wang Jingqi; Wu Guangjian; Ding Rong; Hu Dunfu; Wang Simao; Xu Shiying; Zhou Ren; Zhao Housheng; Yang Weiyu; Li Quanshi; Chen Hexian; Wang Boqi; Lu Gaoyi; Qi Yunqing; Zhang Yuanruo; He Dekui; Xu Xinliu; Chen Zhuzun, and others, as well as representatives from academic organizations stationed in Shanghai from various countries, members of the Philanthropic Society, members of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee, and journalists from Chinese and foreign newspapers and news agencies, totaling over three hundred people. The auditorium was adorned with both Chinese and French flags, serving as a profound symbol of the friendship and academic exchange between the two nations. The presentation ceremony was solemn and grand.</p>
<p>Speech by the French Consul</p>
<p>The Consul-General could not attend today due to other engagements and expresses his deep regret. I am honored to be present on his behalf and to present these books from the French Concession Philanthropic Society to the Oriental Library. I believe that this will further advance the cultural exchange between China and France, and further strengthen the friendship between our two countries. French citizens deeply admire the Commercial Press's rapid recovery and its efforts in revitalizing the Oriental Library. This book donation is merely a small gesture of our support.</p>
<p>Speech by Paul Pelliot</p>
<p>Mr. Pelliot gave a lengthy speech, briefly stating that the dignitaries present at today's grand event, besides the members of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee, Chairman Zhang Yuanji, Standing Committee members Wang Yunwu and Cai Yuanpei, also include Mr. Chu Minyi and Mr. Li Shizeng. Mr. Cai, Mr. Chu, and Mr. Li are all powerful figures dedicated to promoting cultural exchange between China and the West. In particular, they have established many initiatives in Sino-French cultural cooperation. Mr. Li Shizeng is the founder of the Sino-French Cultural Association. Mr. Zhang Yuanji is a renowned Chinese scholar with deep ties to the Commercial Press. He has been able to apply modern corporate organizational methods to lead the Commercial Press to its current glorious state. As for Mr. Wang Yunwu, he is also a scholar and inventor of a Chinese character indexing system, as well as a businessman. The Commercial Press's swift recovery after being destroyed is naturally attributable to Mr. Wang. I am deeply honored to be among so many scholars today, and especially proud to have participated in the selection of books for this donation. The books cover a wide range of subjects and are all fundamental classics, which will hopefully contribute to the exchange of academic knowledge between China and France. The Chinese nation has a long history and occupies an important position in world culture. It has been progressing rapidly in recent years and has a bright future. The French people have always been friends of China, and I extend my best wishes on behalf of the French.</p>
<p>Speech by Zhang Yuanji</p>
<p>Chairman of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee, Zhang Yuanji, spoke as follows: Mr. Consul-General Bodes and esteemed guests, today, the Oriental Library is receiving a donation of over a thousand rare books from the French Philanthropic Society, and we have the honor of hearing remarks from Mr. Bodes, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, representing the Society. As Chairman of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee, I accept this gift on behalf of the Library and offer my sincere gratitude. We all know that while Sino-Western cultural exchange began quite early, it became more systematic in the 17th century. Although scholars from various countries have served as intermediaries in this exchange, we can confidently say that the most credit is due to the scholars of the French Jesuit Order and modern French Sinologists. These French scholars not only brought Western science and Christianity to China, but also introduced Chinese political philosophy, ethics, agricultural technology, and art to Europe. As a result, European thought and art in the 18th century were influenced by Chinese culture. French Rococo artists such as Watteau and political thinkers of the Encyclopedia school, as well as economic thinkers of the Quesnay school, were all products of Sino-Western cultural fusion. Many modern French scholars have a deep understanding of Chinese culture, most notably Mr. Chavannes and Mr. Pelliot, who are especially worthy of our respect. More than a decade ago, I had the opportunity to visit Mr. Chavannes during my travels in Europe and had a delightful conversation. Today, Mr. Pelliot is here to give us a valuable lecture, which is a great honor. Therefore, it is the French who have made the most efforts to promote Sino-Western cultural exchange, and it is also the French who have contributed the most to making Sino-Western culture mutually influential. Today, the French Philanthropic Society's donation of books to the Oriental Library is a strong indication of the French people's continued efforts to promote Sino-Western cultural exchange. I believe that not only the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee should be grateful to our French friends, but we Chinese people should also be grateful to modern French scholars for their efforts to promote Chinese culture. To express our gratitude, we are presenting a copy of the rare edition of the Siku Quanshu recently published by the Commercial Press as a token of our continued Sino-French cultural exchange. On behalf of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee, I would like to thank the French Philanthropic Society for its generous donation of valuable books, Mr. Li Rong, the French member of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee, for his tireless efforts for the Oriental Library over the years, which made this donation possible, and Mr. Bodes, the Consul-General, for presiding over today's presentation ceremony. At the same time, I would also like to thank all the distinguished guests.</p>
<p>Speech by President Wang</p>
<p>Secretary-General Chu Minyi delivered a speech on behalf of President Wang of the Executive Yuan. Although our Oriental Library is a private institution, its collection of books is the most complete and comprehensive. Among the public and private libraries in the southeastern provinces of our country, none can compare to it. Its destruction in the war was a great loss to our nation's culture. Now, the Library is re-collecting books, and although it cannot immediately restore its former glory, it is still a treasure trove of books in Shanghai, thanks to the support of various parties. Recently, the French Philanthropic Society donated over a thousand books and held a presentation ceremony this month, along with a public exhibition. I am here on behalf of the President of the Executive Yuan to attend and receive the generous intentions of our friendly country, which only increases my feelings. I recall that during the European War, a large library in Leuven, Belgium, was destroyed by fire, but after it was restored, countries from all over the world competed to donate books, and within a few years, it once again became a grand sight. This is because culture is a tool for advancing humanity, and books are the embodiment of culture. All civilized nations value this, and therefore, they are willing to support such endeavors. Today, our Oriental Library accepts the generosity of our friendly country, gaining countless works by specialized scholars from civilized nations. We know that other friendly nations will surely share the same sentiments and continue to offer their support. This is what we can confidently expect, based on the past example of the Leuven Library. Therefore, while expressing my gratitude to the French Philanthropic Society, I also offer these thoughts.</p>
<p>Speeches by Wu and Li</p>
<p>Secretary Hong delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Wu, briefly stating that Mayor Wu could not attend in person due to other engagements and that he was representing him. Before its destruction, the Oriental Library was a rich asset of China. After its destruction, thanks to the efforts of the Revitalization Committee, the Oriental Library has now received a donation of valuable books from the French Philanthropic Society, selected by the Sinologist Mr. Pelliot. This not only enriches the Sino-Western culture but also reflects a deep friendship. I respectfully thank our friendly country on behalf of the Mayor and express my admiration for the efforts of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee. Li Shizeng delivered a speech, briefly stating that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Beijing and was asked to attend on short notice, which made him reflect on some things. There are two kinds of spirits in humanity, one is unfortunate struggle, and the other is mutual assistance and cooperation. Today's gathering is a complete expression of mutual assistance and cooperation, and not just a local expression, but a large-scale performance of humanity as a whole. The unfortunate struggles of humanity will surely be changed by the development of the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. Today's meeting is an expression of cultural mutual assistance and cultural cooperation between China and France. This expression is very promising. The Oriental Library suffered greatly, but today's mutual assistance outweighs the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Revitalization Progress</p>
<p>Wang Yunwu reported on the revitalization progress of the Oriental Library as follows: Mr. Consul-General Bodes and esteemed guests, many of you present today have directly or indirectly supported the revitalization of the Oriental Library, and you certainly want to know about the past, present, and future of the Oriental Library. I, as the former director of the Oriental Library and current standing committee member of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee, will give a brief report on these facts and expectations. The Oriental Library of the past, that is, the Oriental Library that was destroyed in the January 28 Incident, was founded thirty years ago by Mr. Zhang Yuanji when he was in charge of the Compilation and Translation Department of the Commercial Press. It was originally named Hanfenlou, and its initial collection focused on Chinese classical books and manuscripts, as well as rare books. More than a decade ago, I succeeded Mr. Zhang in his position, and I also actively collected foreign language books. In 1926, the Board of Directors of the Commercial Press decided to reorganize it into the Oriental Library, making its collection of Chinese and foreign language books available to the reading public. Since its opening, the operating expenses and the cost of acquiring new books have been approximately 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per year, all of which were borne by the Commercial Press. Before the January 28 Incident in 1932, the Library had a collection of 500,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign language books, of which about 80,000 volumes were in foreign languages, including over 10,000 volumes in French. In addition to rare Chinese books, there were also many rare foreign language books and complete sets of academic journals. The complete destruction of such a valuable collection was truly a great loss to culture, which is why people at home and abroad are optimistic about its revitalization. The Oriental Library of the present is the result of the establishment of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee and the current situation. Based on its spirit of founding and maintaining the Oriental Library for the past thirty years, the Commercial Press decided within a year of the disaster, in the spring of 1933, that if there were any profits each year, one-third of the public welfare fund allocated according to regulations would be used exclusively for revitalizing the Oriental Library. In the first year, over 40,000 yuan was obtained, in the second year over 50,000 yuan, and in the third year over 70,000 yuan. In addition, Mr. Zhang Yuanji personally donated 10,000 yuan. Currently, the Oriental Library has a revitalization fund of approximately 190,000 yuan, and the Commercial Press allocates a new fund of 70,000 to 80,000 yuan each year, or at least 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. As for books, the Commercial Press has separately allocated funds to purchase reference books for its compilation and translation departments, following the method used before the Oriental Library was established. To date, over 120,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign books have been purchased, especially a large number of Chinese collectanea from various dynasties. These books will all be available for use by the Oriental Library in the future. Because of this rich collection of books, we can further engage in outreach. Recently, the Commercial Press compiled and printed a large-scale collectanea series for libraries and bibliophiles at home and abroad. This is tantamount to making the collection of a library available to libraries across the country, and even the world. On the other hand, thanks to the efforts of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee and support committees at home and abroad, and the enthusiasm of Chinese and foreign scholars, approximately 20,000 volumes of Chinese and foreign language books have been received as donations. Now, with the enthusiastic support of the Shanghai French Concession Philanthropic Society, over a thousand kinds of valuable French books have been purchased and donated, for which we are extremely grateful. Regarding this generous donation, in addition to thanking the Shanghai French Concession Philanthropic Society, we must also credit Mr. Li Rong, the French member of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee. At the same time, we are also extremely grateful to Professor Paul Pelliot for selecting the books for this donation, and to Mr. Bodes, the French Consul-General in Shanghai, and the French Municipal Council for supporting this charitable act. In the future, the Oriental Library will have an increasing number of books from donations and purchases made with funds allocated by the Commercial Press, and the increase will be very rapid. On the other hand, with an existing fund of nearly 200,000 yuan and new revenue of tens of thousands of yuan each year, it may not be difficult to have a more magnificent Oriental Library in Shanghai in the near future. However, to realize this hope, in addition to the continued efforts of the Oriental Library Revitalization Committee and the Commercial Press, we also need the support of all of you present today and enthusiastic people at home and abroad. The Shanghai French Concession Philanthropic Society's donation of a large number of valuable books to the Oriental Library has a great impact on the realization of this hope, and we will never forget it.</p>
<p>Public Exhibition</p>

<p>No One Can Help in Time after being Harmed by Business Partners; Charitable Organization Plans to Provide High-Quality Coffin and Burial</p>
<p>A tragedy occurred at the six-story pavilion at the main entrance of the Great World amusement park, at the corner of Avenue Petain and Rue Montigny in the French Concession, where an entire family of six tourists (three men and three women), old and young, committed suicide by jumping from the building. Five people died instantly, and a young man in his twenties was sent to Renji Hospital, where he died en route. The French police were informed and dispatched detectives to investigate. The bodies of all sizes were transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for examination. A suicide note was found in the pocket of the deceased wearing a Western suit, awaiting a report to the court for inspection. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, the French Police Department reported the matter to the Second Special District Court Procuratorate, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctor Jiang, recorder Peng Yu, and others, to inspect the bodies at noon. Among the six bodies, the old woman and the seven- or eight-year-old girl had their heads and skulls smashed, with blood flowing all over their faces. The others all had clear and handsome features and died from internal organ injuries sustained in the fall. After the examination, the officials ascended to the courtroom, where police detective Zhang Chunsheng reported the investigation and presented the suicide note. After reviewing the suicide note, the official ordered the examination of the six unidentified bodies, both male and female, large and small, who died from injuries sustained in the fall. The bodies were handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for temporary storage, pending identification. After the examination, the official handed over the deceased's suicide note to the detectives, instructing them to take a photograph of the suicide note and submit it to the court for inclusion in the case file. The suicide note is transcribed as follows: "Recalling that my grandfather was generous and charitable, valuing righteousness and lightly regarding wealth, he built dozens of miles of roads, over ten bridges, and rebuilt seven or eight temples, including the Sanyi Temple, Yue Wu Temple, and Confucius Temple. He provided firewood and rice to poor neighbors and friends. The amount of money owed to my family was no less than hundreds of thousands, but my grandfather and my late father did not seek repayment and burned the account books. This can be said to be a family that does good deeds. However, because of helping a friend in distress, we were harmed and lost 450,000吊. Then, we were harmed by an ungrateful and inhuman administrator, who secretly transferred and misappropriated our family's most prosperous business, causing it to collapse and lose 500,000 yuan. Alas, these are all past events, not worth mentioning. However, I think of my grandfather and my late father, who cherished orphans, cared for the elderly, and pitied the poor, performing countless secret acts of kindness and saving countless people. Now, my entire family of six, three generations of mothers, sons, and grandchildren, have suffered this tragic fate and thrown themselves into the fire. Who can help us in time? Although we value integrity and honor and regard death as a return home, we cannot help but resent heaven and worry about people. The so-called family that accumulates good deeds will surely have blessings to spare, and the laws of nature are clear, and retribution is cyclical, are truly empty words. Written by Zhang Yuexin." The letter was written on three sheets of white paper with blue grid lines of patriotic stationery. The writing is elegant, and the language is quite coherent, indicating that the writer had a considerable level of education. It is speculated that the deceased's family was originally wealthy but was harmed, leading to this extremely tragic suicide. However, the deceased's bodies were placed in the funeral home, and no one came to identify them until yesterday evening. According to an inspector at the amusement park, the deceased were seen playing in the amusement park for three days. The bound feet of the deceased old woman and middle-aged woman suggest that they were from the Hubei area. Mr. Guo Shaowen, the director of Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home, considering the tragedy, could not bear to bury them in ordinary wooden coffins according to custom. He plans to wait until today and, if no one comes to identify them, will ask the directors of the funeral home to allocate high-quality clothing and coffins for burial and relocate them to the Pudong burial ground to await future identification by family members.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Competing for Hotel Guests Leads to Use of Knives <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Chen Huaye is Severely Injured, Also Involves Debt Issues</p>
<p>Yu Qi, a Cantonese man working as a greeter at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road, had an argument with fellow Cantonese Chen Huaye near Wuchang Road and Chongming Road at 11:25 AM the previous day, due to competing for hotel guests. Chen was stabbed in the chest and lungs by Yu with a knife, causing serious injuries. Yu also suffered knife wounds to two fingers on his right hand. As a result, two Chinese constables No. 1667 and No. 1289, and Cantonese detective Feng Qi, arrived on the scene after hearing the alarm and took both Yu and Chen to the Hongkou Police Station, from where they were transferred to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yu was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was brought before the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Municipal Council stated that the case originated from a guest named Yu Jinhe who arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong and stayed temporarily in room 403 of the hotel. According to hotel custom, guests who come to Shanghai for the first time and are unfamiliar with the city must be accompanied by a greeter to various places. Chen had initially contacted the Yu guest, but the defendant subsequently went to the room and claimed that he knew the guest and should accompany him on the sightseeing trip, which led to a dispute and also involved debt issues. Chen stated at the police station that the defendant had been arrested for smoking opium at the Taoyuanli opium den on North Zhejiang Road and taken to court, where he was fined 30 yuan. Chen had paid the fine on his behalf, but the defendant had only repaid 12 yuan after being released, and the remaining amount had not been repaid to date. This morning, he had argued with the defendant once over the unpaid debt. It had nothing to do with guiding the guest. At that time, the defendant pushed him down and stabbed him with a knife, etc. He is currently seriously injured in the hospital and cannot attend the court. The defendant claimed that the victim used to run an opium den and owed him 20 yuan for opium. He had repaid two yuan. When he tried to collect the debt, the victim took out a knife and stabbed him. He seized the opportunity to resist and accidentally injured the victim in the chest, hence the injuries to his right fingers. However, the two Chinese constables did not witness the fight, and the knife was not recovered. Both sides have different versions of the story, and the situation is complicated. The case should be postponed so that the victim can recover from his injuries, etc. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody and the matter to be further investigated at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e112">In Front of the Da Fang Hotel, Bandits Kidnap and Rob <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Victim Released Mid-Journey, Total Loot Reaches Seven Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The Hetai Money Exchange and Cigarette Paper Shop, located at No. 87 Zhonghua Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession, is owned by Yu Heqing from Ningbo. He usually supplements his income by promoting new banknotes for various banks. Recently, because the shop used counterfeit “double dime” coins, the French police investigated and confiscated 1,391 counterfeit "jiao" coins. He was prosecuted in the Special Court No. 2, sentenced to three months in prison and fined 300 yuan. He is currently appealing on bail. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, Yu ordered his shop assistant, Le Jinzhang, to take 7,000 yuan in cash in his own chartered car to the China Industrial Bank on the Museum Road to exchange for the bank's banknotes. As Le's car, pulled by the driver Ah Fu (from Tongzhou), was heading north, passing Caishi Street and reaching the front of No. 30 opposite the Da Fang Hotel, suddenly two bandits jumped out of a car parked by the roadside, blocking Le's rickshaw. They forced Le out of the rickshaw. At the same time, two other bandits rushed up, dragged Le out of the rickshaw, and, together with the bag of banknotes, pushed him into the car parked by the roadside. The bandits knocked the rickshaw puller down and drove the car north, turning west onto Avenue Edward VII. Le's rickshaw puller, witnessing the scene, frantically shouted, "Robbery! Kidnapping!" Nearby detectives who heard the shouts arrived, but it was too late to chase them. The bandits grabbed the bag of banknotes from Le in the car. As the car traveled to West Dahua Road, Mu'er Ming Road, Jing'an Temple Road, the bandits stopped the car, hired a rickshaw, ordered Le to get out and ride in it slowly, and the kidnapping car sped off. The two bandits escorting Le fled not far after that. After being robbed, Le knew he was safe. He regained his composure, took a rickshaw back to the shop, informed the shop owner, and reported the robbery to the French police, requesting them to apprehend the robbers. The police telegraphed the Public Concession police and the Chinese Public Security Bureau to cooperate in the investigation. Subsequently, it was found that at 8:30 AM yesterday, two middle-aged men came to the Lihua Car Company at the Jiujiang Road and Zhejiang Road intersection, hiring a car to go to Fenglin Bridge in the Chinese district, paying a fare of two yuan. The cashier dispatched driver Cao Miaoqi (from Tongzhou) to drive car No. 18032 (French Concession) and No. 4437 (Chinese Concession). The two passengers then sat in the car. Cao drove to the Da Fang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Road in the French Concession to wait for friends. Upon arriving in front of the Da Fang Hotel, the two passengers in the car greeted two men waiting by the roadside and spoke to them quietly, instructing the driver to wait. Unexpectedly, they were the robbers kidnapping the victim. Around 10:00 AM, the car was discovered at the Tokyo Road and Macau Road intersection, which is under the jurisdiction of the Putuo Road police station in the western suburbs of Shanghai. Patrol officers noticed it and reported it to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate the car. The keys had been taken by the robbers. They tried to take the car back to the police station for verification. Meanwhile, the British and French police agencies dispatched detectives to investigate and apprehend the robbers.</p>

<p>Twelve Robbers Arrested in Two Days, Large Number of Guns and Bullets Confiscated</p>
<p>Recently, due to the frequent occurrence of robbery cases in the Public Concession, the head of the Police Department ordered all police stations to intensify investigations and arrests. On the 4th and 5th of this month, the Huishi Police Station, as well as the Xinzha and Gordon Road police stations, successively arrested twelve robbers, confiscating five handguns, twenty-eight bullets, and one fake handgun. Details are recorded below: (1) Huishi Police Station Detective Chief Shang Wu and Detective Wang Youshan, acting on a tip-off, arrested Gu Wenming, Shen Xinbao, Tang Jinyuan, Shen Xiaolu, and Wang Agen at No. 14 Laozha Street, North Fujian Road, at 6:35 AM the day before yesterday, confiscating one handgun, seven bullets, and four bombs. They took them back to the police station. According to Gu's confession, the handgun was given to him by his son-in-law, a boatman named Yang, who planned to go to Zhujiajiao, Qingpu, by Yang's boat to commit robberies. The detective went to arrest Yang but could not find him, so he detained the arrested criminals. (2) At 9:15 AM on the 11th of last month, several robbers suddenly broke into the home of Zhang Tangshi at No. 5 Lane 10, Dagu Road, robbing 545 yuan. After reporting to the police, the Xinzha Police Station detectives Ma Zhongrong, Ding Huaguo, Yang Yunfeng, and Patrol Officer Xu Zhengting arrested the robbers Shen Agen, Yang Haiming, and Tao Qiuquan at Room 13, Chunjing Inn, Ningxing Street, French Concession. Subsequently, they arrested Xu Qiukui on Xizang Road and confiscated two handguns, seven bullets, and one fake handgun at Shen Agen's home at No. 14 Xingping Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. All were taken back to the police station for detention. (3) Gordon Road Police Station Detective Chief Zhu Mengwei and Detective Zhang Liang arrested the robbers Wang Tiechen and Liang Jufang at Maqi Road, Binlang Road, at 6:15 PM on the 4th. They found a handgun and fourteen bullets in Wang's waistband. According to Liang's confession, the gun was given to him by Liu Junchen of No. 733 Liyuan Road, Nanshi. The detective then arrested Liu and temporarily detained him in the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, the police sent all the criminals except Liu Junchen to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the circumstances of the arrest and requested a postponement for investigation of the crimes committed by the criminals. After questioning by Judge Liu Yugui, he ordered them to be returned to detention for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Dongjiadu Ferry Accident Continues to be Investigated <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Boatmen Involved in the Accident Have Been Sent to Court, Number of Drowned Still Awaiting Clarification</p>
<p>The ferries going back and forth between Pudong and Puxi at the various wharves such as the Muddy Beach Wharf, Old White Ferry, etc. in Nanshi used to be operated by manpower. When encountering strong winds and rapid currents, they were extremely dangerous. They have now been gradually converted to ferries or towed by small boats. However, the ferries at the Dongjiadu ferry still employ manual rowing. Every day from 2:00 or 3:00 AM until 1:00 AM in the evening, the number of passengers coming and going is endless. The proceeds are distributed according to shares. Around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, a ferry boat driven by boatmen Zhao Jintao and Huang Yonghua, carrying more than twenty male and female passengers, was rowing from Puxi to Pudong. When it reached the middle of the river, about five or six zhang away from the Pudong wharf, a Chunhua ship suddenly came from north to south. Because it was sailing at full speed, it was unable to avoid it, and it crashed into the ferry boat amidships, breaking it into two pieces. All the people on the boat fell into the water. Although sixteen people were rescued, five people drowned. (Outside reports say there were as many as eleven people). The water patrol team arrested the boatmen Zhao Jintao and Huang Yonghua who caused the accident and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. The bodies were being retrieved and other details were reported in the previous news. Now, it is found that the boatmen did not take preventive measures beforehand, resulting in this tragedy. Now they are imprisoned, which is indeed unavoidable. If ferries and small boat towing had been adopted earlier, making navigation faster (it takes only five minutes from Puxi to Pudong), collisions could have been avoided. Yesterday afternoon, the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau questioned Zhao Jintao and Huang Yonghua again and then sent a document dispatching police to transfer them to the District Court for interrogation and legal action. At the same time, it instructed the water patrol team to pay attention to retrieving the bodies and investigate exactly how many people drowned. It instructed the ferry leaders Ji Hegui and Zhao Agou to be responsible for finding out the facts and reporting back for verification.</p>

Lu then reported to the Public Works Bureau on Dixiwei Road.

They had drafted three opinions, requesting amendments and supplements before implementation. They were then informed that the submitted documents had been fully noted, reviewed, and the points raised were examined. Although there were some misunderstandings or matters not permitted by administrative procedures, there were also many points that could be referenced based on academics or proven facts, which should be considered and adopted when revising the regulations to facilitate their implementation. You should be informed, etc., and the implementation was postponed twice. In addition to quietly waiting for the amendments, the associations, for the sake of safeguarding the government's prestige, instructed all members to comply with the regulations in the previous year. Recently, according to reports from the members, since the implementation, they have deeply felt that it is difficult to implement, so they convened a joint meeting, drafted opinions, and publicly recommended Xu Raochu, Zhou Bangjun, Yuan Hesong, Zhou Mengbai, Tu Kunhua, Zhao Rudiao, Xu Chao, Xiang Jiwu, Shen Jichuan, and Sun Choucheng to go to Beijing to petition. Reasonably prepared a petition, together with the written opinions, asking the representatives to come forward to petition, respectfully requesting your esteemed court to grant an audience to facilitate a personal presentation, which would be truly convenient.

The police immediately called for help and transported the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment in the prisoner transport vehicle. It is said that his condition is very critical.</p>

<p>Zhongfa Pharmacy Distributes Rendan on Dragon Boat Festival: The Dragon and Tiger Brand Rendan produced by Zhongfa Pharmacy is effective in preventing epidemics, dispelling evil, opening the appetite, and aiding digestion. Not only are its effects greater than the old-fashioned realgar and Atractylodes lancea, but it can also compete with imported products of similar sound but different meaning. Therefore, on the Dragon Boat Festival, when all factories are closed and pedestrians gather on the streets, staff were sent to distribute it to maintain public health and benefit the people. This is no small matter. This is also good news during the Student Made-in-China Year.</p>

<h3 id="e138">On the Use of Colloquialisms <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>Although there is debate in vernacular literature about writing in Mandarin versus local dialects, the insertion of colloquialisms is unavoidable. Therefore, in vernacular literature, the use of colloquialisms does not need to be mentioned.</p>
<p>But strangely, there is also extensive use of colloquialisms in classical literature. From this, we can know that not only is the use of colloquialisms not strange in vernacular literature, but it is also very common in classical Chinese.</p>
<p>The use of colloquialisms is actually a literary element. Using colloquialisms can make literature more vivid. When expression is insufficient, colloquialisms must be used to convey the author's opinions and accurately depict the intended form, regardless of importance or size.</p>
<p>Only shallow craftsmen feel that using colloquialisms damages the elegance of the writing. Therefore, among writers of the past, only masters dared to use colloquialisms, knowing the benefits of doing so. Others were not qualified.</p>
<p>In ancient prose, the Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han are renowned. However, the Records of the Grand Historian actually incorporates many colloquialisms, and the Book of Han is praised for its conciseness and luxuriance precisely because it skillfully uses the language of the people at the time. For example, in the Records of the Grand Historian's "Biography of Chen She," there is the line:</p>
<p>"What a guy! Chen She, becoming a king, so majestic!" (The character "者" was pronounced like "睹" in ancient times.)</p>
<p>This sentence perfectly depicts the demeanor of farming friends. "夥頥" is a colloquialism for amazement. Another example is in the "Biography of Zhou Chang," which describes the stuttering Zhou Chang admonishing Emperor Gaozu:</p>
<p>"I cannot speak well, but I know, know that it is not right. Your Majesty wants to depose the heir, I know! I will not obey the decree."</p>
<p>This also vividly imitates the way people speak colloquially.</p>
<p>As for the Book of Han, such as the "Biography of the Empresses," the long memorial of the Sili Jie Guang impeaching the Zhao Feiyan sisters simply uses colloquialisms to record the confessions of palace maids and eunuchs. Therefore, it feels very simple. Because the passage is too long, it is inconvenient to quote it here.</p>
<p>There are also many examples of using colloquialisms in ancient poetry. Du Fu is known as the "Poet Sage," one of the greatest poets in China, but he uses many colloquialisms. For example, in the poem "Sending Cai Xilu":</p>
<p>"The horse's head is close, the brocade on its back is blurred."</p>
<p>"匼匝" (meaning dense) and "模糊" (blurred) are both colloquialisms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Du Fu often uses the characters "喫" (chi, to eat) and "箇" (ge, a measure word), saying "eat" as "喫" and counting things with "箇." Are these not colloquialisms? For example, "Drinking upstairs, sleeping downstairs," "Just let me eat my fill in my remaining years," "I promised to eat plums with Old Zhu," "Parting is quite sorrowful, I cannot eat when facing wine," and "The mountain stream startles the monkeys hearing '筒' [a bamboo pipe], 'Two 筒s of yellow trick the singing orioles,' 'Instead adding a 筒 to the well curb.'"</p>
<p>As for the poems "Presented to Bi Siyao" and "Early Autumn Suffering from Heat," it can almost be said that the entire poems are written in colloquialisms. Du Fu's greatness can be said to lie in this.</p>
<p>Others such as Ying Qu, Zuo Si, and Cheng Xiao of the Six Dynasties were all vernacular poets who were popular with the people. They especially liked to use colloquialisms. Here is Cheng Xiao's "Mocking a Hot Guest" as an example:</p>
<p>"In my life during the three dog days, there are no carriages on the road. I close the door to avoid the heat and lie down, not visiting each other. Nowadays, 　　children, heat reaches their homes. When the host hears of a guest's arrival, he frowns. Thinking they should leave, they sit and 跘跨, what they say is not urgent, what they like to eat is so much? Tired of it for a long time, only asking "Where are you from?" Shaking his painful thighs, sweat flows down. Do not say it is a small matter, it is also a great flaw. Passing on the precepts, observing brightness, heat traveling should be scolded!"</p>
<p>In this poem, "　　," "跘跨," "嗜啥," and "極那" are all colloquialisms, showing that ancient poets used them often. Others such as "Raise my head and gaze at the bright moon, lower my head and think of my hometown," "Three thousand miles of river water, twelve lines of letters home; each line says nothing else, only that I should return home early," and "A pot of wine beside the bed" are all written entirely in colloquialisms, as clear as plain speech. This shows that colloquialisms do not harm elegance and can help to make the writing lively and fluent.</p>
<h3 id="e139">"Children's Literature" <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Ding</p>
<p>This year is Children's Year. The term "children's literature" has also been specifically brought up with the start of the year. To meet this need, the number of children's magazines published by various publishing houses has increased, and there is competition to publish children's libraries and the like. From the perspective of children, this is certainly a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>The majority of children in China have always lived in an atmosphere of "non-culture." A few dry books, some even accompanied by a green bamboo ruler, have nearly all been taught to become "precocious" with lifeless faces. I remember when we were children, we were absolutely forbidden to read literary works or anything similar, whether at home or at school. Some of my friends hid under black quilts, lit a stick of incense, and read "Journey to the West" and the like, almost blinding their eyes. This terrifying past has been forever drowned by the flowing time: surely there should be much more progress now? But I read an article by Mr. Bai Fen on "Taibai" that said "It's hard to teach even smart kids!" It is said that the teacher, in order to make the students feel the class he was teaching, took them to Baoshan Road to take a look, but the next day, the father came to the teacher to reprimand him: "No way!" That's the gist of it. However, it can be imagined that today's children are not necessarily much better than we were then!</p>
<p>However, this year's children can be considered to have had a stroke of good luck. They were always called to hide behind the backs of their fathers and elder brothers, but now they have suddenly been embraced in front of everyone. So, it is inevitable that everyone will point at their small mouths and faces and comment on them, eventually saying: Children should also have literature. Good, I am very willing to raise both hands, because I especially remember the eyes of my little friends from the past. In fact, this question should have been shouted out loudly long ago.</p>
<p>Speaking of "children's literature," according to the Chinese custom of dealing with problems, I am afraid that some people are already scratching their heads and frowning, saying: Half of the year is gone! In fact, the problem is not so simple. It is definitely not something that can be accomplished by some "Ode to Children" to celebrate the occasion. It is serious and arduous work. All those who are truly immersed in culture, truly thinking about the next generation, should have such determination, one year, two years, ten years, a hundred years... to bloom small flowers, and also to bloom big flowers, flourishing and widespread.</p>
<p>To suit the tastes of children, creation is certainly important; but what is especially important for us at present is to cultivate authors. To be practical and rich, we must "learn" from the masterpieces of the world. Translation is even more urgent. Therefore, foreign works should be introduced as much as possible. At the same time, we should be confident that Chinese "children's literature" should be a time of hardship, of cultivation on the one hand, and of creation on the other.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Night Crossing (11) <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Leng</p>
<p>Seeing everyone criticizing her and not one person willing to give her sympathy and tolerance, the young woman couldn't help but shout anxiously.</p>
<p>"By the heavens and earth! I am not an accomplice of robbers! I 　　hid this package on my stomach. Maybe the robbers thought I was fat, so they didn't pay attention."</p>
<p>These words caused everyone in the cabin to burst into laughter. Only Mr. Xunqing did not laugh. He kept stroking his beard, sometimes incidentally reaching up to stroke his right cheek.</p>
<p>After laughing for a while, Grandma Degui coldly began to speak again.</p>
<p>"Hmph! No one, not even a three-year-old child, would be fooled by such words. Robbers have such sharp eyes. The gold hairpin on my head, almost half of it buried in my hair, was searched away by them. How could they have missed such a large package?"</p>
<p>Mr. Xunqing raised one hand high, striking a pose like an old magistrate passing judgment.</p>
<p>"Alright, this is enough to prove that she is an accomplice of robbers. Another suspicious thing is that her face is very unfamiliar. I have lived here for so many years and don't seem to have seen her before. Is there anyone among you who recognizes her?"</p>
<p>Eight or nine out of ten people in the cabin shook their heads. The only ones who didn't shake their heads were Liu Cangshui, Dongsheng, and Abao. They also didn't recognize the young woman, but they were somewhat dissatisfied with Mr. Xunqing's arrogant attitude. However, they all understood that their status was very low and they were definitely no match for Mr. Xunqing, who was known as the "Red Serpent." Therefore, although they felt sorry for the young woman, they dared not say anything.</p>
<p>The young woman seemed to be suffocating from the cabin's cold atmosphere and began to sob softly. Suddenly, she stood up resolutely and said to the crowd, choking with sobs:</p>
<p>"Everyone here is sensible. If I were an accomplice of robbers, why wouldn't I have left with the robbers? This gentleman is clearly trying to frame me. I don't know who he is, but just now in the dark, he reached out to touch... touch me..."</p>
<p>"Touched what?" Wu Hexuan asked slyly, full of interest, while glaring fiercely at Mr. Xunqing.</p>
<p>"Touched my breasts!" The young woman continued, her face reddening. "I shouldn't have slapped him. I didn't expect him to hold a grudge and now bite me back, insisting that I'm an accomplice of robbers!"</p>
<p>"Hmph, hmph!" Wu Hexuan couldn't help but sneer at Mr. Xunqing twice in a row. He secretly felt delighted, thinking that Mr. Xunqing's hypocritical mask was now completely torn off. The eyes of the people in the cabin were also stunned and fixed on Mr. Xunqing's face, as if they were all surprised that such a stern and rigid person would also do shady things in secret.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Courtesy <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>As usual, in the evening, I locked the door of the small school and took the key home for dinner. My home was a single room in Zhongyu's small family. Thanks to his wife and him, this lone person could eat with them.</p>
<p>Being immersed in dealing with a jumble of things all day, I only found tranquility at this time. I was happiest leaning on that bamboo back chair, listening to my own heartbeat and listening to the young couple's laughter.</p>
<p>Today was especially early. I specially went back to tell them, fearing that the woman would be anxious, since Zhongyu had accompanied the bank's inspector into the city and might not return for a day. When I left, there was still half of the setting sun remaining in the sky.</p>
<p>When I got home, the brown thatched roof made people feel warm at first glance. As I entered, the old yellow dog wagged its tail in its sleep to welcome me. The courtyard set off by the courtyard house was square and tidy. A row of large sunflowers with big heads was placed there, their colors harmonizing perfectly with the white walls.</p>
<p>Listening, it seemed that someone was talking in the main room. I was inconvenienced to go in and disturb them, so I swallowed the words that were on my lips and went straight to my room. The room was shady and very cool.</p>
<p>I sat on the bamboo chair with a backrest and whistled. I thanked my little landlord. She had already prepared a large bottle of cold boiled water for me. I raised the bottle and poured it down my throat in one breath.</p>
<p>I whistled again: I closed my eyes…</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, when did you come back?..."</p>
<p>It was dark. Zhongyu's wife came in to deliver a kerosene lamp. She shouted loudly, and I woke up from my drowsiness.</p>
<p>"What happened?" I said, laughing. "I fell asleep as soon as I sat down..."</p>
<p>I stood up and told her that Zhongyu had gone into the city. She listened indifferently. A minute later, she spat and looked straight at me with her big, round eyes, saying, "Wait a moment, I have something to ask of you..."</p>
<p>The woman in the blue robe went out, her black hair bouncing on her head.</p>
<p>A smile floated on my face. In a moment, I saw the woman come in carrying a bamboo basket of pink eggs, her expression very solemn.</p>
<p>"Giving gifts?" I couldn't help but joke. "Seems a bit early for the old nephew—isn't it?"</p>
<p>She glared at me fiercely, and a rose-red color flew onto her cheeks. She lowered her head, her hand pressing on her bulging abdomen. Since she became pregnant, she had refused to go out and dared not see strangers. She was teaching a class in the small school, and at this time she had to give it to her husband. Only I, their only neighbor, often made fun of her about this.</p>
<p>"I'm talking about serious matters," she said, feigning anger. "This was sent to you by an old relative of mine. She said that you have already investigated the fields for the loan, and she wants to ask you to add 20,000 or 30,000 to the loan and temporarily calculate it as first class..."</p>
<p>"This!" I put away my smile. "This is not easy to do."</p>
<p>I thought that it would be difficult to handle loans of more than 20,000 without "fairness." Although bribery was rampant, it was definitely not allowed to exist in the fledgling cooperative. Although, because of emotion, I could not explain it to her in white (in fact, she also understood), so I could only say:</p>
<p>"Please return this gift to her and ask her to write down her name. I can check if there is any false reporting..."</p>
<p>When Zhongyu's wife heard my "official talk," she believed that she was avoiding misunderstandings and insistence on the matter. I had to change the atmosphere and start laughing again: "But, I will eat your red eggs."</p>
<p>After a pleasant supper, I went to the adult night school to teach.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Old Maid <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Shi</p>
<p>Every year in spring,</p>
<p>Leaves behind a sigh.</p>
<p>In unspeakable resentment,</p>
<p>She watches the tender green of youth pass away.</p>
<p>Her cheeks turn a dull, waxy yellow,</p>
<p>No longer able to conjure a smile on her lips.</p>
<p>Those full, beautiful curves,</p>
<p>Have lost their lightness.</p>
<p>Submerged in boundless loneliness,</p>
<p>A resentful heart.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Old Sheep <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>His surname was Liang. His meek and kind temperament was like a sheep's. Our companions all called him—Old Sheep.</p>
<p>Old Sheep was one of the most pitiful among our companions.</p>
<p>Timid, with sensitive, nervous qualities, his blood always flowed with the germs of sadness and loneliness.</p>
<p>He was always telling us wild tales, having strange dreams in the daytime, always holding onto negativity. He told us many times, always saying:</p>
<p>—A person can't live like this any longer. Every hour I ask myself, what reason do I have to live? On moonlit nights, I ask the moon, silently gazing at the wobbly stars. I think my own life is hanging in mid-air with no support.</p>
<p>We often comforted him with sympathy, but Old Sheep couldn't be persuaded. In helpless situations, we sighed for him:</p>
<p>—Old Sheep's illness will not get better!</p>
<p>A few years ago, his lung disease was in its second stage, and he still didn't know how to take care of himself. A fellow villager of his told us: When Old Sheep's lung disease was severe, he vomited a lot of blood every day. Because he was the only son in his family, and his father died when he was young, his mother's last hope was on him. However, during Old Sheep's serious lung disease, he still planned to kill himself every day. His mother, watching his large piles of blood, hugged his thin, out-of-shape body, and cried:</p>
<p>—My son! Don't vomit, okay? Don't vomit anymore!</p>
<p>A bag of tears in her old eyes, aching, fell out.</p>
<p>His mother spent thousands of medical expenses to treat him, and his lung disease finally slowly improved after a long period of recuperation.</p>
<p>In his 19th year, Old Sheep was married by his family.</p>
<p>He was not satisfied with this clumsy new wife who had lived in the countryside since childhood.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he became our close classmate at × Middle School that he told us:</p>
<p>—I couldn't bear to go against my mother's wish for me to get married, but on the day of the wedding, I planned to escape. Later, my secret was seen through by my family and I couldn't escape. On the seventh day after the wedding, I decided to say goodbye to my mother and go to the city to study.</p>
<p>—Let me tell you, I have never acknowledged this woman. I didn't talk to her for seven days and seven nights. She's clumsy and stupid, doesn't know a single character, and has an ugly appearance. I can't explain to myself why I should love such an annoying woman.</p>
<p>Every time he talked about his own problem, his heart would be broken, and some unresolvable sadness would all attack him together.</p>
<p>We explained to him that there was nothing in the world that couldn't be solved. Couples who couldn't be together could divorce. We knew that he must have thought about it too, but he felt that there were various difficulties for the other party, so he gave up.</p>
<p>He looked at life with depressed eyes, but he was a young man full of emotion, often letting his overly sensitive nerves run wild, thinking about the vague, unrestrained sky. He had no grasp on life, and only cursed this chaotic society. He felt that life had no hope, no foundation, in a world where he couldn't find a way out. He was dejected and depressed.</p>
<p>Old Sheep's illness would not get better. He was a bottle of sake that had run out of air.</p>
<p>When a person reaches a state of extreme sadness, their mind becomes sick. We knew that he had a female classmate at school whom he wanted to love but dared not, but he cursed them for being vain every day, gnashing his teeth and cursing that women's hearts were the most poisonous. He told us that he wanted to go to a desolate mountain temple to become a monk.</p>
<p>Every evening, when we talked to him, his emotions would become uncontrollably excited. While talking to us, he would suddenly shout out, and a layer of sweat would ooze from his forehead. A face that was usually brownish-yellow would turn red, sadly smiling sourly, and crying in the end.</p>
<p>I didn't dare to talk to him casually. I couldn't bear to hear a companion's laughter that turned into crying.</p>
<p>It had been almost three years since we parted ways. Although I had met him once in between, his temperament didn't seem to have changed. I thought Old Sheep's illness would not easily get better.</p>
<p>Tonight, the wind is howling. I am also gazing at the wobbly stars in the sky. Under the full sky of stars, does he also know that a lonely heart is remembering him?</p>

<h3 id="e144">Local Elementary School Teachers Celebrate Teachers' Day Yesterday <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Over 500 Faculty and Staff Attended; Bureau Chief Pan and Section Chief Chen Gave Speeches</p>
<p>Yesterday was Teachers' Day. All the combatant teachers of municipal elementary schools held a celebration meeting at the auditorium of Wuben Girls' Middle School at 10 a.m. yesterday. More than 500 teachers from various schools attended. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Celebration Details The celebration meeting began at 10 a.m. The presidium included Xu Shushen, Qian Xuanqing, and Hu Huaitian. After performing the rituals, Chairman Xu Shushen first reported on the significance of Teachers' Day, followed by a speech by Yu Zhongbiao, the representative of the Municipal Party Department. Bureau Chief Pan and Section Chief Chen of the Municipal Education Bureau then gave speeches. Afterward, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. At noon, a luncheon was held at the Tongxinglou restaurant on Fourth Avenue. In the afternoon, participants traveled by car to Yeyuan in Jiangwan for sightseeing.</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Pan Bureau Chief Pan's speech briefly stated: "Today, municipal elementary school teachers are celebrating Teachers' Day here. I am very happy to attend and express my gratitude on behalf of the elementary school students. The chairman mentioned earlier that while teachers' material life may be relatively simple, they find great comfort in their spiritual lives. When we celebrate Teachers' Day, the value of the celebration should be directly proportional to the achievements of the students we teach, rather than the amount of material goods. If we hope to make the celebration meaningful, we must work hard in teaching students. Elementary school students are more numerous than middle and high school students, and all middle and high school students have passed through the elementary school stage. Therefore, all students have been taught by you. Your responsibilities are significant, and you receive much spiritual comfort. Today, taking the opportunity of Teachers' Day, I would like to talk to you about a famous teacher. Confucius is a pioneer teacher, a predecessor of teachers, and already famous both domestically and internationally. However, his achievements were entirely in education. He taught three thousand disciples. Teaching so many students in the Spring and Autumn period was not easy. Confucius said, 'Learning without satiety, teaching without weariness.' These two sentences are the standards that teachers should adhere to throughout their lives. Teachers should not be weary. If they constantly dislike life in their hearts, they will be weary. This will affect their work, so they must have the spirit of courage and diligence to teach without weariness. However, while teaching without weariness is important, learning without satiety is also important. If we only use what we have learned in the past to teach, we will definitely run out of knowledge. Especially now, everything is progressing at every moment. We must keep up with the times. Confucius said, 'Reviewing the old and knowing the new.' This is the annotation of learning without satiety. If you can do both, you are a complete teacher. I hope you will work hard to achieve this, and your harvest will increase with time."</p>
<p>Hong Kong Education Sector (Hong Kong, 6th) June 6th is Teachers' Day. The Hong Kong education sector held a celebration meeting at the Entertainment Theatre at 9 a.m. Two thousand faculty and staff from various schools participated.</p>
<p>Guangdong Education Association (Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th) The Guangzhou Municipal Primary Education Association held a meeting at the Minjiao Hall at 1 p.m. on the 8th to celebrate Teachers' Day. A general membership meeting was held on the 7th to discuss improving teachers' lives and important education matters.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Middle and High Schools (Hangzhou, 6th) At 8 a.m. this morning, approximately 2,000 teachers from large, middle, and small schools in Hangzhou celebrated Teachers' Day at the Lianhua Cinema. Zheng Zixiang presided over the meeting. Representatives from the Party Department, Municipal Government, and Education Bureau gave speeches, and the film "Spring River Flower Moon Night" was screened. The meeting adjourned at 11 a.m.</p>

<p>The Most Complete in the Far East The Lizi Society in Nanjing has always been known for its perfect sports facilities.

It is the most complete handball court in the Far East, in order to actively promote handball. The invitation of renowned Chinese and Western players to perform this time has aroused the interest of people there and is a precursor to future handball matches between Beijing and Shanghai.</p>

Shanghai's renowned Chinese and Western players have all conceded defeat. He has won the Shanghai Open Handball Singles Championship twice. His fame is as great as Li Huitang in the football world. (2) Sun Daosheng has practiced handball for more than ten years and has made great contributions to the development of handball. He is quite old and physically weak, relying on his skills to surpass others. Almost everyone in the Chinese and Western handball community knows this veteran.

<p>Congratulatory Letter from Director Pan Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, sent a dozen handballs to congratulate the Society on the completion of the handball court and personally sent a letter to Huang Renlin, the Secretary-General of the Society. The original letter is as follows: (Omitted above) I have recently learned that your Society is building a handball court and promoting handball movement, which I admire very much. Handball in our country actually started in the Shanghai Youth Association. Now that you are promoting it in the capital, it is foreseeable that it will become popular throughout the country in the future. Now, the comrades in the Chinese and Western handball community here will jointly go to Beijing to participate in the opening ceremony of your Society's handball court. I have specially entrusted them to bring twelve handballs to mark the occasion. Please accept them. I hope and pray for it. (Omitted below)</p>

<p>Rumors That Hong Kong Is Cooperating with China to Ban Silver Outflow; Even With Large-Scale Selling by Major Players, the Final Trend Remains Very Strong</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday, amid the closure period, saw foreign silver fall and rise. Immediately upon opening, it rose, but weakened slightly midway due to large-scale selling by major players. Foreign news reported that the Hong Kong government is cooperating with our country to ban silver outflow, leading to a surprisingly strong close. In the early morning, due to the approaching closure period, foreign telegrams reported that British and American silver markets had fallen. "Big feet" [market players] claimed that the market weakened after closing due to selling by Chinese speculators and that the final transaction was 25 lower. The forward silver price in Montevideo also fell by 1.9%. Exchange rates generally rose. London pure gold fell by 9.5 pence. News reports varied, and although sentiment was strong, it appeared somewhat uncertain. Outside the market, pre-market trading opened at 756 yuan. Unexpectedly, many who entered late faced high prices, and the market gradually declined. The Central Bank's official rates were released, reflecting reduced British and American rates. Customs gold units rose by 1.2%. The standard premium price was listed at 837 yuan and 7 jiao, with only a slight rally in the middle. The morning opening was quite flat. After opening, major players entered aggressively at low prices, immediately pulling the market up. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu sold shillings, and the HSBC rates were released, with British rates flat and American rates up by 0.25. Soon after, the market trended downwards, but banks showed considerable appetite, supporting the market. When the Chinese Merchants Bank also came to support, the exchange rate tightened, and the market rose by 0.07. However, due to outflows from domestic goods and Guangdong merchants, many took profits at the high, and the decline was rapid. However, the 70-yuan mark was not broken. Banks took advantage of the momentum to continue supporting, and sentiment remained stable. Subsequently, the market was stable for quite some time. Finally, sentiment shifted from extreme calm to a desire for movement, and buying interest increased, resulting in a strong recovery in the afternoon. In the post-market, the news of small Indian silver sparked buying interest and a rise, but major players continued to sell, causing a renewed decline. Reuters reported that the Hong Kong market softened due to falling Indian silver and news that the United States would change its silver purchasing policy. Although there was a rise, at this time, Indian silver rebounded by 0.06, but soon stabilized. Guangdong merchants made some purchases. A Reuters report citing Hong Kong financial circles stated that the Hong Kong government's ban on silver exports sparked buying interest and pushed the market close to the 80-yuan mark. Many continued to sell, and the upward trend was temporarily halted, but the final close was still strong. After the close, Associated Press reported that the Hong Kong government was meeting to cooperate with China to ban silver outflow, causing a further rise. This was due to the tightening of exchange rates, and both Hong Kong and Shanghai were expected to face a shortage of funds.

<h3 id="e170">Securities: The Bond Market Is Easier to Fall Than Rise <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was closed for the Dragon Boat Festival. Yesterday, the market resumed as usual. Because the situation in North China has eased and the financial situation is gradually stabilizing, and because the environment has improved, retail investors are sporadically making up for their losses. At the opening, prices rose across the board. Troop reduction bonds rose by six jiao, and the rest all rose by about half a yuan, showing a promising trend. The 1996 public bonds also initially rose, but in the long term, a large number of No. 53 bonds were sold off, reaching as much as 3 million yuan. Although "Si Ji" and "77" bravely bought in, they felt that supply exceeded demand, and as a result, the market price alone fell by a jiao. At the close, due to this influence, morale fell again, and various parties sold off one after another, causing market prices to fall by about two or three jiao. The 1996 bonds continued to fall by about two jiao. At the opening of the afternoon market, the aforementioned continued to decline, ranging from five fen to three jiao. The latter saw a slight rebound. Before the close, prices rose and then weakened, and the 1996 bonds continued to rise. Looking at the market situation over the past few days, it has been easier to fall than rise. Recently, the difference between near-term and long-term market prices has narrowed, and retail investors are not hesitant to arbitrage. However, this situation has not yet developed. If this continues, it is not a good sign for the bond market. Yesterday's market price results were still mixed, with a total turnover of 22.39 million yuan. The high and low results are listed for comparison as follows: (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>The Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (5th) the New York stock market rose, especially utility stocks, because the proposal to ban utility securities companies by Chaplin and Rayburn is unlikely to pass. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph reached a new high in 1935, copper and iron stocks were flat, and small exchange stocks rose slightly. The bond market also rose under the leadership of utilities and railroads. The total daily turnover was 1.1 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>After the sharp drop in the yarn market, it has shown a slight stabilization. However, the surrounding environment is still deteriorating. Foreign yarn is deeply penetrating the interior and is being sold at reduced prices, which has greatly hit Chinese yarn. In addition, the money supply is tight, and business feels particularly bleak, making it difficult for the market to recover. However, some have profited from going long, and may be able to maintain it for the time being.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Still Flat</p>
<p>Before the opening of the spot yarn market, most expected a rise of one yuan, because U.S. cotton rose 40 points yesterday. Today, however, it only fell 10 points. However, the opening market was calm, with few buyers. Near-term months are still good, while far-term months are trending down, mainly due to financial instability. Second and third rounds are still flat, but most bulls have not moved, and large bears have not taken action. As a result, near-term months rose by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 jiao compared to the previous day's close, while far-term months fell by 0.4 and 0.5 jiao. The afternoon opening was still flat. It was heard that 800 bales of current yarn were traded, and morale slightly improved. As a result, each month rose by 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 jiao compared to the previous day's close. It was found that Tongji sold 650 bales, Dafat 700 bales, Yuanda 850 bales, Ruida 400 bales, Shenji 2,450 bales, Yuda 600 bales, Mingde 650 bales, Jiankang 800 bales, Hengde 450 bales, and Yichang 450 bales. Dafeng bought 500 bales, Gengfeng 1,000 bales, Yuan Yi 1,200 bales, Changfeng 1,950 bales, Changyu 1,100 bales, Hexing 400 bales, and Yida 400 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Month July 168.0 167.7 167.9 0.30 41,150</p>

<p>Total 201,700</p>
<p>Yarn Sales 800 Bales</p>
<p>The sales of current yarn are average. It was found that various guilds bought a total of 804 bales throughout the day. The market is trending weak, falling by 0.25 jiao. The purchase amounts of various guilds are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 5</p>

<p>The cotton market is becoming increasingly weak, and the market situation is increasingly bleak. Because yarn factories are closing down one after another, and layoffs are becoming more serious, the demand for raw materials has been greatly reduced. It was found that there are still more than 800,000 dan of cotton in Shanghai, and it is said that there are also 20% in Tianjin, Hankou, and Jinan that have not been shipped out. Therefore, the cotton market is weaker. However, U.S. cotton has recently been rising.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Continues to Decline</p>
<p>Before the opening of the spot cotton market, everyone expected a rise of several jiao, because U.S. cotton rose sharply yesterday. Today, however, it slightly fell by 10 points. The gold market is also good. Unexpectedly, the market turned down at the opening, mainly because Mupan Company raised prices too high yesterday. In addition, it was reported that Wuhan First Factory implemented a factory closure due to sluggish yarn sales, and factories in Changzhou and Wuxi also stopped the night shift. Therefore, although foreign cotton is good, the domestic textile industry is becoming increasingly difficult, and there seems to be a surplus of raw materials. Therefore, people are bearish on the cotton market. As a result, each month fell by 0.15 to 0.3 jiao compared to the previous day's close. Some in the market observed that if there are no unexpected changes, spot cotton must see 30 yuan. The afternoon market was flat, and trading in the market was not smooth. However, Dafu, who bought at inflated prices yesterday, sold 4,500 dan. As a result, each month rose by 0.05 jiao compared to the morning close. It was found that Tongji sold 6,100 dan, Dafu 4,500 dan, Daji 1,500 dan, Shenchang 3,500 dan, Ruida 11,200 dan, Yifeng 3,000 dan, Zhenda 2,000 dan, Taixing 2,300 dan, Junchang 1,700 dan, and Tonghe 1,800 dan. Dafeng bought 2,800 dan, Taixing 1,200 dan, Gengfeng 4,800 dan, Yuan Yi 1,500 dan, Changfeng 4,200 dan, Changhe 4,800 dan, Deji 3,200 dan, and Changyu 1,700 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Rise and Fall Inventory</p>
<p>June 31.70 31.55 31.60 Fell 0.15 149,300</p>

<p>Total 784,700</p>
<p>Factory Needs Special Clearance</p>
<p>The consumption of current cotton is very clear. Most factories are preparing to reduce work, and the sales market for raw materials is lacking. The source is estimated to be 520 bales of Yao cotton, 250 bales of Yong cotton, and 41.10 bales of Tongzhou cotton. Weitong Factory Imported 100 bales of spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened, and due to the closing of long positions, mainland guilds and the Far East sold off. Liverpool news was bad, and the French cabinet fell. Each month fell 13 to 19 points. Afterwards, Liverpool guilds bought in and industry demand was good, showing a slight rebound. However, due to local and New York sales, and good weather, it fell again. However, some in the industry bought in, and Liverpool was still inquiring. Washington's prospects were developing, and the Xinyong Association delayed the matter of adopting new legislation until October. Spot fell 10 points, and futures fell 9 to 10 points. Buyers and sellers bought in, and local guilds sold off. The closing of the French authorities' problems caused spot to rise 5 points, while futures fell 1 to 2 points. The short positions were liquidated, because the news of supplies was not good. 0.75 to 1 than a ratio, 1.5 to 1.75 than a ratio, 0 to 1.25 rupees.

<p>The flour market opened soft in the morning. Foreign wheat did not rise or fall much. Actual spot flour sales have decreased, and market sentiment is empty. Selling pressure is very strong. This month is close to spot flour, and the falling trend is strong. Near-term months are smaller than this month, and far-term months can still hold steady because various factories are not shipping. However, there is currently more new wheat, and the money supply is tight. Actual sales are watching, and the market still needs to be soft. At the close, this month suddenly fell by 0.75, July and August each fell by 0.1, and September, October, and November each fell by 0.05.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened in the morning, and foreign wheat did not rise or fall. The market can still stand flat. In the afternoon, spot standard flour suddenly fell, and new wheat was strong. There was also a lot of old wheat. In addition, the financial sector has repeatedly changed, and the money supply is tightening. Market sentiment is empty, and selling pressure is immediately strong. All months fell sharply. The closing price for July was down 0.05, August down 0.06, and September down 0.05. Spot wheat also became weary as more arrived. Higher prices were each down 0.35. 9,500 bags were opened in the unified market, and Fuxin, Gaofeng, Xinshen, and Da divided them up.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation has deteriorated day by day due to the financial turmoil in recent days. After the market opened yesterday morning, there was a sign of decline. Fortunately, the Jiujiang guild and the Nanjing guild, etc., took advantage of the flat prices to handle loading, and the market was able to stabilize. In the afternoon, digestion was idle again, and each block still saw a slight decrease of 0.35. Due to the money supply relationship, the inland guilds did not have as strong digestion as before. This street also only made a slight gesture. Throughout the day, 8,500 bags of Saigon were opened, 2,500 bags of small screws, 200 bags of Siamese rice, and more than 500 bags of Hakka Xian. Prices were all down 0.35 compared to before the holiday. Subsequent Hakka conversion was not strong, and may need to be cut again.</p>

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various guilds were slightly more, with a total of nearly 50 numbers (goods totaling nearly 10,000 shi). However, the Fanghuo appetite in the sales market is still suspended, and there are not many on this street, so the market color is ultimately mediocre. As a result, the situation is stable with a soft undercurrent. If the prices of thick japonica rice and thin indica rice, etc., have no glory or disgrace, and the transformation of yuan, etc., also feels tired and difficult to revitalize.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) In the past two days, about 40 ships arrived from various routes in He Xia. The sales of each goods were sluggish, the price of northern japonica rice was nearly a jiao short, and the price of early thin indica rice also followed down by about 0.1 jiao. The transformation of yuan goods sold poorly, and the price looked soft. The rest of the goods also looked tired.</p>

<p>In the bustling city, two processions came head-on. One procession was a military band and drummers, blowing and beating, and finally a red sedan chair with a new bride ready to be married. The other procession was also a military band and drummers, blowing and beating, and the end of the line was a black lacquered coffin containing the corpse of an old lady. Marriage is the tomb of love, and this is the best concrete symbol.</p>
<p>Climbing to the drying platform to watch the airshow, I thought it was much clearer and more comfortable than the people standing on the street, craning their necks to watch. Looking back, who knew that people peeking out from the ×× Building were laughing at us for standing too low. Don't laugh, friends, "There are stronger hands than the strong, and more capable people behind the capable." The people sitting in the plane are laughing at us like a group of ants.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Way to Make Money <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Schoolteacher</p>
<p>Here, I want to record a way for a low-energy principal to make money. In S city, this low-energy principal can be a standard figure who is good at running schools. He is not good at rhetoric, not good at teaching, but good at financial management.</p>
<p>His fat and short body, black and delicate beard, fits the saying "Many bumps in a short man's belly." In the small school he runs, there are three hundred boarding students. Each student has to pay one yuan for barber fees and three yuan for laundry fees at the beginning of the semester. He hired a barber from the interior, paying him six or seven yuan a month, specializing in doing top work for the students. He hired two middle-aged Jiangbei maids, giving them twenty yuan every six months, specializing in doing laundry work for the students. After calculating both sides, the low-energy principal can get a net profit of at least eight hundred and up to one thousand yuan every six months from these three people.</p>
<p>Because he advocated the New Life Movement, he issued a notice before the holidays: All school servants' wine money will be canceled. If anyone privately asks students for rewards, they will be fired immediately once verified. On the one hand, he levied servant fees of eight jiao per person. In that way, there would be an extra income of one or two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Advocating goods and implementing a cleanliness campaign are good policies for the low-energy principal to manage finances. All student books, stationery, and even daily snacks must be collected from the school store and settled at the end of the semester. They must not be purchased privately from outside the school to avoid mistakenly purchasing imported inferior goods: or hindering hygienic food. Violators will be deducted from their conduct score. In this way, the school store's business is booming and it is overwhelmed. And the low-energy principal's wallet is also "full of money."</p>
<h3 id="e180">Salt Drying <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Wandering Goose</p>
<p>Salt drying is a side business for people living on the coast.</p>
<p>The suitable season for salt drying is the three periods of late spring, summer, and autumn. The salt matures most rapidly in the hot summer and early autumn. In the severe winter and early spring, it is not easy to dry seawater into white particles due to the cold weather.</p>
<p>On the morning of every clear day, or at the specified time, the tide in the sea rises to the beach as usual. On a vast salt field below a long and wide embankment, rows of salt pans are arranged (commonly known as salt boards); the bottom layer of each pan is filled with a thin layer of sea mud. Salt farmers, men, women, old, and young, are busy working there: The boys, barefooted, carry buckets of seawater from the beach, over the embankment, and place them on the salt field. The salt husbands and salt wives then pour the water into the pans, filling each pan with five-tenths of water. After spreading the water everywhere, everyone covers and stacks the salt pans on top of each other between every two pans, or stacks them into a pagoda shape. This is because there are more pans and fewer pans, so that the sunlight can shine on the water between each pan.</p>
<p>Before and after lunch in the upper and lower halves of the day, when the sun is scorching fiercely, they switch the upper and lower layers of the salt boards twice. When the setting sun is setting, the water in the pans becomes crystal clear and white salt blocks. Then the salt farmers use baskets to carry the salt back, and hide the salt pans in the thatched sheds beside the salt field.</p>
<p>After the salt blocks are stirred, they all become loose particles. On the next morning, the salt farmers carry them basket by basket to the market or town to sell, or sell them to the salt shops.</p>
<p>The livelihood of the salt farmers should have been reliable, but because of the heavy taxes and donations in recent years, the price of salt has been high. Due to economic bankruptcy, even the amount of salt consumed in rural areas has decreased, so they are now in a deep abyss of suffering!</p>

<p>He looked at it, put it on the table, and said with a smile that it is easy to buy antiques in Luoyang and Xi'an. It is very difficult to distinguish the true from the false. Zhiqian said, "Have you been to Luoyang?" He smiled and said, "I have been there. I have been to Zhangjiakou, Suiyuan, and Taiyuan in Northwest China. This time, I also want to go to Lanzhou to see." Zhiqian said, "So, you are very interested in Northwest China." Tony smiled, "Not only me, but many American economists are very interested in Northwest China. China's air routes are increasing in the northwest, and the United States is very willing to help China in aviation." Zhiqian smiled, "You are right, a large amount of commercial aircraft are being sold to China?" He smiled, seeming to nod a little. Zhiqian said, "Are you an aviator?" Tony said, "No, I am a businessman, I manage gasoline. Two trunk lines of the Northwest Highway have just been completed, and there are already several hundred cars. In the future, there will be more cars, and gasoline will need to be supplied in large quantities. I really want to go to Lanzhou to investigate the amount of gasoline needed." Zhiqian's heart moved, and he smiled, "China is originally one of the largest sales markets in the world, but the southwest and northwest parts are not convenient for transportation, and foreign goods cannot be sold smoothly. Now, Western China is working hard to build highways, which will naturally be more developed for selling foreign goods than before. What are your thoughts on this matter?" As he spoke, he looked at Tony and smiled. Tony propped his chin with his hand, thought for a while, and then gently pressed in the air with his palm, expressing his affirmation, and replied, "Really, you are right. But things like gasoline, China does not have. If you don't welcome the import of large quantities of gasoline, what is the use of this highway?" (233)</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Not only for various decorations, but also for clothing, the Empress Dowager also carefully selected. She has a very deep study of color tones, knowing which colors are suitable for which person, and which colors will not conflict with each other, as clearly as an artist. Therefore, before holding the morning court every day, when the eight of us female officials were all dressed up and waiting in her palace, she would often carefully look at the clothes we were wearing one by one. If she saw something that was not satisfactory, she would inevitably shout loudly:</p>
<p>"This robe is wrong again! Don't you even realize it yourself! Go and change it to another one immediately, go! Hurry! Remember, no other color will do, you must change to a blue one! Don't make any more mistakes! ...! Seeing what you are wearing now is really disgusting."</p>
<p>Sometimes, the female official who was reprimanded might not understand what the Empress Dowager meant. Although she dared not openly defy, she could not help but feel a little hesitant. So the Empress Dowager had to explain it to her more clearly. For example, she said:</p>
<p>"Don't you understand? When we are very happy, all colors that are too light or too obvious will disturb our thoughts even more—like the pink robe you are wearing now. Not only is its color extremely incompatible with your own face, but it will also make us viewers feel strangely glaring, so it must be changed!" (333)</p>
<h3 id="e184">Designations of Imperial Commissioner and Governor-General <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Aibo</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw these few sentences in section 323 of "Yu Xiang Piao Miao Lu" in this column: (Omitted above) Speaking of Zhang Zhidong, probably no reader does not know his great name. At that time, he was serving as the Governor-General of Huguang, but when I was a child, he had not yet achieved such a prominent position, and it seemed that he was serving as the Imperial Commissioner of Hubei Province. (Omitted below) According to the original text, the author distinguishes the Governor-General and the Imperial Commissioner as two different official positions, which is inevitably a mistake. In fact, the Imperial Commissioner is the Governor-General, and the Governor-General is the Imperial Commissioner, truly "one and two, two and one."</p>
<p>Why is this so? Originally, most Governors-General in the Qing Dynasty concurrently governed two provinces (there were also exceptions for those who concurrently governed three or four provinces, such as the Governors-General of Liangjiang, Zhili, and the Three Eastern Provinces). They had the authority to control the civil and military officials of the two provinces, so people called him the Imperial Commissioner, and common people often called him the Imperial Chair. This was the official system of the former Qing Dynasty, and everyone at that time knew it. However, now that the Republic of China has been established, some people are confused. Deling was a female official in the former Qing Dynasty, why is she also unclear about this matter?</p>
<p>There is another saying that Zhang Zhidong, in the former Qing Dynasty, was promoted internally from the Hanlin Academy and then sent out to serve as an official. The first official position he held outside was the Governor of Shanxi, and later he was promoted from Governor to Governor-General, serving as the Governor-General of Guangdong-Guangxi, Liangjiang, and Huguang. His career was smooth sailing until the end of his life, and he never held any other minor official positions. Moreover, in the Qing Dynasty, there was only the Governor-General of Huguang, and there was no Imperial Commissioner of Hubei. We should pay attention to these common historical knowledge.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement Wu Jun Jiren is quite experienced in raising goldfish. Last year, there was a compilation of "Goldfish Breeding Methods," with an initial edition of 10,000 copies, which were sold out. This spring, a second edition of 2,000 copies was printed, and now there are not many left. Fellow goldfish lovers who wish to obtain a copy can send a letter with a ten-cent stamp attached to Tangjiazhai, No. 4, Jinyi Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, and it will be sent by mail immediately.

<h3 id="e185">Miscellaneous Notes on Zongzi <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Schools of Thought From Qingming to the Dragon Boat Festival, in our hometown, it can be called a season for eating zongzi. Especially during the Dragon Boat Festival, every household, big and small, has to wrap some zongzi; therefore, there is a saying in my hometown, "If you don't eat zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival, no one will send you off when you are old!" to imply the custom of eating zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival. Residents of Shanghai also have a lively time eating zongzi during the Dragon Boat Festival, but the way Shanghai zongzi are made is completely different from those in our hometown. Originally, the so-called Shanghai people nowadays cannot represent true Shanghai people, as most of them have moved from various places, so we cannot be sure where the zongzi come from, but through our superficial exploration, we can at least discover "Guangdong zongzi," "Ningbo zongzi," and "Suzhou zongzi" categories. Ningbo and Guangdong zongzi emphasize firmness, but Suzhou zongzi are relatively more soft and glutinous, and the zongzi in our hometown are more or less the same as Suzhou zongzi. Therefore, when we eat Ningbo zongzi, we always feel they are too hard to swallow and we are not used to them. Sometimes, when we bring some zongzi from our hometown, thinking they are rare treasures, Shanghai people, who are used to eating hard zongzi, praise them endlessly when they eat ours, and distribute a few to their neighbors, east and west. Who would have thought that things would turn out unexpectedly? Not only do they not say a word of praise, but they say that our zongzi are too soft and rotten. It seems that everyone has their own preferences, and I cannot help but doubt the saying, "When it comes to taste, people have the same preferences!"</p>
<p>Wrapping Method My hometown of Songjiang is very particular about food. Even zongzi, except for some residents living in the countryside who are not very particular, town residents are also very particular when wrapping zongzi. In terms of the types of zongzi, the shapes include triangular zongzi and long zongzi. As for the fillings, there are red bean paste, lotus seed paste, jujube, fresh meat, ham, and preserved meat. What I want to mention here is fresh meat zongzi. The way fresh meat zongzi are wrapped, in our opinion, the most elaborate is to first cut the meat into large chunks and soak it in carefully selected soy sauce. After the glutinous rice is washed, it is drained using a strainer, and the soy sauce is mixed into the rice at any time. Then, the zongzi leaves are used to wrap it, with half rice and half meat. It should be wrapped loosely, and after wrapping, hard firewood is used to cook it three times and rest three times. After five or six hours, the zongzi are cooked. Generally, vegetarian zongzi are mostly triangular in shape, while meat zongzi are mostly long in shape. Soy sauce is not added to the rice for vegetarian zongzi. The meat in the zongzi is best with half fat and half lean, so that it is deliciously fatty. Zongzi are not easy to make; if they are not wrapped well or cooked well, there will be uncooked rice. Recently, the Sijing zongzi found on the Shanghai market are also wrapped in this way. Sijing is a town in Songjiang, and Sijing zongzi have long been famous in Songjiang. The most elaborate zongzi, in addition to fresh meat, also add chestnuts and chicken meat inside, called "chestnut meat zongzi" and "chicken meat zongzi."</p>
<p>How to Eat Zongzi taste best when they are eaten on the spot after they are cooked, but for the leftovers, we can heat them with boiling water or cook them in cold water every day before eating. Some people like to dip them in white sugar, while others do not, which of course depends on individual preferences. However, during the Dragon Boat Festival, the weather is getting warmer, and zongzi cannot be stored for long. If they are not stored well, they will spoil. But we also have methods to keep them from spoiling for a long time, which is to put them all in a pot and boil them every two or three days. In addition, the water used for cooking the zongzi for the first time is kept, and the zongzi are placed in this water, which can also preserve them for a few more days, but too much will also cause them to spoil.</p>

<h3 id="e186">"The Clock of Life and Death" and Other Things <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>I heard that in the center of Berlin, Germany, a "Clock of Life and Death" is now being built to show the state of population reproduction and mortality in Germany. This clock chimes every five minutes. During that time, the needle indicating reproduction reports the birth of nine people, and the needle indicating death reports the death of seven people. Offsetting life and death, the German population increases by two people every five minutes, an increase of more than 210,000 people per year.</p>
<p>As far as we know, there are now two countries in the world that are enthusiastically implementing policies to encourage childbirth. One is Germany, and the other is Italy. They have many ways to encourage childbirth, such as levying a small unmarried tax, holding group weddings, subsidizing marriage expenses (which directly encourages marriage and indirectly encourages childbirth), and giving bonuses to families with children (the amount of the bonus is proportional to the number of children). And this "Clock of Life and Death" planned to be built in Berlin, this unique facility, although it cannot be regarded as a method of encouraging childbirth, but its concern for the increase or decrease of the national population can be seen from this.</p>
<p>According to the current state of the world economy, the populations of various countries can only be reduced, and should not be hoped to increase. Because in recent years, the world economic recession has become increasingly acute, and the number of unemployed people in various countries is increasing day by day. Under these circumstances, unless the economic organization of society is fundamentally transformed, the only way is to use the method of birth control to gradually reduce the population of various countries. To encourage childbirth is very inappropriate.</p>
<p>However, Germany and Italy are currently taking policies that are exactly the opposite. They pay close attention to their national population problems, only fearing its decrease and not worrying about its increase. Therefore, they not only do not approve of birth control, but even implement policies to encourage childbirth. They hope to use the means of encouraging childbirth to increase the population of the country day by day. They are not at ease just with this encouragement. Like Germany, they also want to build a "Clock of Life and Death" to keep statistics on the reproduction and mortality of the national population at any time.</p>
<p>But in today's world economic panic, why do Germany and Italy want their national population to increase? Well, this is easy to answer. We only need to look at their intensified preparations in the military field to understand why they want their national population to increase. Naturally, to have war, one must manufacture munitions. However, it is useless to have munitions without people to use them. Because although munitions are powerful, they still cannot automatically run to the enemy's position to annihilate the enemy. Therefore, to put it bluntly, the purpose of Germany and Italy encouraging childbirth and hoping for population increase is to cultivate batches of frontline soldiers. They are rushing to manufacture munitions on the one hand and encouraging childbirth on the other, which is truly a rationalization of military preparations.</p>

<p>— Lie</p>
<p>When sitting quietly, my fingers often inexplicably touch the chin and caress those stiff whiskers. They have spread from the temples to the neck, so vigorously, like wild grass in spring, growing densely. Sometimes they prick my fingers with slight pain. However, a lot of idle time is spent on this simple action, and when I think about it afterwards, I can't help but laugh at my own ridiculousness.</p>
<p>Recently, a safety razor was discarded, and those stiff whiskers became even wilder. They almost occupied the front half of my neck, so when I stroked them, I couldn't help but want to look in the mirror to see what kind of appearance they had turned me into. Because I usually see a disheveled beggar, and what I dislike most about him are those loose and fluffy things: I think everyone has this idea, right? Would those things spreading between my chin and neck turn me into that terrible image?</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child in school, I liked to touch my smooth chin, take square steps, and imitate the appearance of a teacher. Children's thoughts are of course simple. At that time, I didn't envy the dignity of the teacher, but imitating that appearance meant that being a teacher was like this. Now I have indeed become a dignified teacher, and those whiskers under that smooth chin naturally spread directly to the front half of my neck. However, when I stroke them myself, I don't even have a bit of the simple thoughts of childhood, and I only feel my own ridiculousness.</p>
<p>Facing the window of my bedroom is a playground. After school, those innocent children are playing with a ball happily. There is one smallest student, probably he doesn't have the ability to compete with his classmates, and he is crying with a sad face in a corner of the playground. That student is in the small class, and I don't teach his books, so I can't call out his name, so I wave to him at the door of my bedroom. He stared at me for a long time, but still didn't move a step, and the lack of this exercise showed very clearly from those lively little eyes that he needed someone to sympathize with him. So, I idly thought that perhaps this was caused by the teacher's dignity? So I slowly walked to the corner of the playground and picked him up. At first, he tried to sink his body down, as if rejecting my embrace; I said many good things to him, that I would buy him a big ball tomorrow, and he smiled innocently.</p>
<p>When he came to my bedroom, he became lively, playing with my shoes, asking who the pictures on the wall were. Finally, he took a safety razor from the dressing table. He asked me as if surprised: "Teacher, what is this?" I told him the name, and he asked me what it was used for? I immediately made a gesture and installed the blade.</p>
<p>"Teacher, then why don't you shave off your beard? It's scary!"</p>
<p>"Are you afraid of the beard?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Like a savage!" He finally said the reason why he was afraid of me. (Not the teacher's dignity)</p>
<p>These words deeply stung my heart. This beard can no longer save my golden age, but instead makes the children afraid of me. I immediately shaved off all the whiskers and picked him up to kiss his rosy cheeks.</p>
<p>"Teacher, you're not scary anymore, like my dad."</p>
<p>He stretched out his little hand to touch my smooth chin, but quickly withdrew his hand. "Teacher, it hurts!" he told me.</p>
<p>Yes, although those messy whiskers have been shaved off, the stiff stubble cannot be eradicated, just like wanting to save my golden age, it will become a scary appearance tomorrow!</p>
<p>After that little student left, I threw away the safety razor. It is a mask, it cannot help my true appearance, and may even pull me onto a worse path.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Old Man <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Jingfu</p>
<p>Bare-chested, with a black cloth bath towel draped over his shoulders and back, two iron plates with the word "May" written on them hanging behind his buttocks, and a hole in his short pants, this is the old man Ah Shou who pushes a wheelbarrow.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>From afar, he looks like a trembling patient, not standing very steadily; however, if you look closely, you can clearly see that his two withered feet are concentrating all their strength and energetically holding it up. However, his whole body is trembling with bloating, showing dark bluish-green veins, without a single piece of smooth and tender muscle. The calves of his feet, especially showing overwork, look like a bent cane.</p>
<p>He is so dark that he looks like a black person born under the equator! This is also a trace of prolonged exposure to the scorching sun.</p>
<p>His hair is sparse, half black and half white, with a full face of unevenly growing, messy weed-like beard. This old fellow also comes out with people early in the morning to find business opportunities.</p>
<p>A coolie like this is often unsaleable.</p>
<p>However, today he is very happy to have made a deal.</p>
<p>He can be considered a lucky one. He wasn't snatched away by his companions. He and a young man were hired together. Shaking off his withered and tired energy, the old man is very calm and careful, and he puts all his strength into it. Finally, he has piled a lot of things on the wheelbarrow. Under the urging of the employer and the grumbling of his companion to hurry up, he takes a few breaths, congratulating himself that his work has safely started.</p>
<p>If you focus on watching his unceasing progress by his side, you will really sweat for him. The young man is sitting in a rickshaw following his master, and he has already run several yards ahead, constantly turning his head and shouting anxiously: "Hurry up! What are you doing?" "Hey, hey," hurry up, it's just a little bit of the road," they are really too impatient to walk and wait, and their tone gradually becomes anxious: "If you can't push it, I'll hire someone else, it's really unlucky to hire this dead man!"</p>
<p>The old man's whole body veins are swollen and trembling as if they are about to crack, and beads of sweat are dripping like rain. Sometimes they flow from his forehead into his eyes, but he is anxious and can't even wipe them off. Because his hands and body are tightly gripping the handlebars, like the end, and his body cannot let it tilt. If his hands or body relax even a little, the car will tilt and everything will fall down with a crash. He struggles with all his strength, like dragging a treasure that is about to fall, so focused on his work; he can't even loosen his mouth to catch his breath, and he can't answer the shouts ahead, he is just anxious.</p>
<p>"Dead man, dead man, hire another one." These words further hit the already difficult-to-support, exhausted old man's energy, causing him to have several bouts of dizziness, and his whole body becomes even more fiery and lacks strength. However, he tries his best to endure, still panting urgently, and struggling even more to carry out his work, and the veins and skinny flesh of his whole body tremble even more severely. Pushing, pushing, if he doesn't push, he will go hungry.</p>
<p>When the car is pushed to the place where he has to go down the high and sloping place from the bridge, the old man's heart beats so hard that even his hands and feet are unbearably sore. The people in front shout loudly to be careful, he can only risk pushing down with his last strength, trembling, almost as if he is about to fall down, and he is a little dizzy. Just as he is about to reach the flat road, the heavy force of pushing down from above is like dragging him, making him unable to hold on any longer. His own body and the car are trembling, his strength is exhausted, his hand softens, and the things fall down with a crash, and the sound of the mirror breaking echoes, and his eyes go black for a moment.</p>
<p>The owner jumps out of the car and rushes over, and slaps him in the face: "Damn it, see how you pay for it with your old life." The old man trembles and can't speak. After arguing for a while, they still didn't take his old life, and hired another one. Finally, they slap him in the face again: "You didn't take your life and you still want money! Really unlucky, met a ghost!" The old man, whose energy is exhausted, falls back and sits down with sore legs.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing regarding the singing program of the Xingguang (Starlight) Society advertised in your newspaper, which listed my younger sisters, Wang Dandan and Wang Xiaodan, as performers. My sisters have never joined any singing group of a commercial nature, nor have they ever performed for the Xingguang Society as guest singers. It is highly inappropriate for the society to include my sisters' names in advertisements published in your newspaper, causing confusion among listeners. In addition to sending a separate letter to the society to address this issue, I respectfully request that your esteemed newspaper grant a correction.</p>
<p>With utmost gratitude,</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>

<h3 id="e193">"Reckless" Screening <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>This is a musical, song-and-dance, romantic, and artistic emotional drama starring MGM's famous and sexy star Jean Harlow, William Powell, the "Great Detective" lead, and Franchot Tone and Melvyn Douglas. The content depicts the Broadway scene in America and the contradictory lives of gentlemen in high society. The most unique feature of the song and dance program is Bjues' new song, "Reckless," and other famous songs. The Peruvian magic dance, neon-lit glass bed, lingerie show, and kiss market are all creations of art and science that are truly beautiful and breathtaking. One cannot appreciate their wonder without witnessing them. Therefore, when "Reckless" premiered in the United States, tickets were sold for as much as $6.60 in gold currency, and viewers did not consider it excessive, which shows the value of the film. It is indeed a remarkable work of recent years, now being screened by "Nanjing." The image on the left is a scene from the film.</p>
