<p>時評</p>
<h3>公司股票不能流通之原因何在</h3>
<p>— 罄</p>
<p>日前本報時評討。論工商業吸收資金問題。曾謂我國公司股票無公開行市與流通機關。求者難求售者難售。成為不能流通之證券。此固我國一般公司股票之現狀。然其原因究何在乎。請就此點。作一番歷史的檢討。</p>
<p>考我國證券業之發軔。最初實以「股票公司」之名稱為號召。當歐戰初興。我國實業。蓬勃一時。股票交易。亦頗繁盛。當時公司股票。若招商局。寗紹公司。大生紗廠。商務印書館。漢冶萍公司等。在市塲活躍之狀。至今猶深印於我人腦際。而公債交易則以發行數量有限。僅居備位而已。然而曾幾何時。歐戰吿終。一度興盛之實業。大都一蹶不振。影響所及。股票市塲之基礎。摧毀殆盡。公債交易乃代興而獨占市塲。及至信交風潮發生。投資者惑於利益之優。厚頗多囊括所有以應。不意一敗塗地。資金擲於虛牝。一般投資者於此乃不得不稍有戒懼焉。</p>
<p>公司股票之被搜於市塲。固屬時勢及環境使然。然而若干公司因經營不善而信用失墜。亦其重要原因。曩昔中華國民製糖公司之創設。發起人振臂一呼。投資者不可謂不踴躍。卽內地人士。亦多兼程來滬。要求入股。方期國民之投資興趣。從此逐漸引起。不意又以事前之設計欠善。與主持者之事業失敗。未及正式開工。卽陷於不可收拾之地步。十餘年來雖經多方籌劃。迄無復興辦法。至於往昔曾以營業優異著稱。而因主持者不循常軌。過度擴充。卒蒙無可挽救之損失者。尤所在多有。凡此工商業中失敗之事實。足以影響全體公司企業之信用。此今日我國公司股票之所以不易流通也。</p>
<p>抑近年證券市場因一般商人熱中投機之故。其營業以公債之期貨買賣為生命綫。現貨交易不過聊備一格。無足輕重。於股票買賣自更置之度外。前聞所外人士有另組股票交易所者。乃因倉猝開拍股票。現貨交易。種類龐雜。交易寥寥。未及半月。遂復歸於有行無市。良以公司股票名目衆多。公司內容。彼此互異。不僅一般人士對之無深切之認識。卽證券業者恐亦少研究之素養。此類參考刋物。又絕無僅有。投資者問道無由。何從引起投資之興趣乎。</p>
<p>今後欲求公司股票之重復活躍於市塲。自應從一般商人减少其投機心理。經營實業者樹立其社會信用始。</p>

<h3>挽回東非戰禍　艾登挾策蒞巴黎　英法意三國會議今日開幕　從經濟方面覓求解決方案</h3>
<p>（巴黎）三國阿事會議明日將於某負責者對路透訪員所稱熱切而無所　悲觀與樂觀之空氣中開幕惟一船人士之意見、多抱悲觀、衆覺英國實操解此難題之鑰、但現除艾登外、無人知英國將有何建議者、艾登巳於昨晚抵此、新聞訪員候之者甚衆、艾登未向發言、卽驅車赴英大使署、</p>
<p>據倫敦路透電稱、英國對於三國談話、將予以密切之注意、英國一般輿情、現深知意阿戰禍發作後、所將引起之遠大後果、英國現覺意阿爭案雖屬困難、且現已臻緊念之階段、但現若能使之回至平心靜氣以事研究之點、則仍有解决之道、現望三國之談話或能達此目的、英政府在過去數星期中曾透澈研究大局之各面、經濟一點亦經涉及、故艾登此次當能提出建設的建議、以供諸代表之討論此項建議對於爭議之雙方、絕不施用壓迫、且可於協定能使雙方接受的一種計畫之工作、大有裨益、目下所可行者、為和戰兩途、若不求和平解决、則自必訴諸武力、英國之意見、苟出於戰之一途、則勢必不顧三令五申之條約義務、而歐洲之阢隍不安、將為更甚、蓋一切國際契約之價值、於是均將使人懷疑、郎此一點、已足使遠處局外之各種族發生反響、而不堪收拾矣、衆料三國會議將由法總理賴伐爾主席、意國之代表為阿洛錫男爵、會議之結果、將報吿九月四日集議之國聯行政院會議、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法談話開始　艾登陳述英國觀點　主以經濟利益許意　政治割讓表示反對</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法兩國代表團、於今晨十一時在外交部舉行第一次談話、討論意阿問題、至十二點十五分始畢、英國方面出席者為不管部大臣艾登、駐法大使克拉克爵士、外部常務次官汪西泰爵士、法國方面出席者為總理兼外長賴伐爾、外部政務司長巴日東·外部機要秘書羅沙、賴伐爾繼向報界發表公報、謂彼將於明日與意大利代表阿洛錫會晤、星期五日則與艾登阿洛錫舉行正式會議、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據哈瓦斯社外交訪員探悉、今晨英國不管部大臣艾登與總理兼外長賴伐爾舉行談話時、艾登僅向賴伐爾陳述英國對於意阿爭端之觀點、英國政府主張以一九〇六年關於阿比西尼亞之三國條約、及一九二五年十二月二十日英意兩國互換之照會為基礎、以成立關於阿比西尼亞之協定、查一九二五年十二月二十日英意互換之照會內、允許與阿國有關係之各國獲得經濟發展之均等機會、但政治的優惠權則應加以擯斥、該官言並許意國在阿國獲有廣大勢力範圍、以從事經濟開拓、惟柴那湖及尼羅河上游各支流沿岸地方、則應保留作為英國利益範圍、此項宣言所規定之原則、本可訂結一種條約、嗣因阿國政府對於條約草案不能同意、故作罷論、目前英國並未欲在阿國獲得何種新利益、且準備支持意國之經濟要求、惟政治的書讓、則為英國所反對、蓋因阿國為獨立國且為國聯會會員國、如其領士完整一旦破壞、則勢必危及以國聯會為基礎之集體安全制度也云、至於賴伐爾則竭力主張意阿爭端必須獲得和平解决、蓋不然則恐難免在國際間引起嚴重之後果也、本日英法談話之內容大體如是、明日意國代表阿洛錫抵巴黎後、當可以意國政府主要觀點、向賴伐爾有所陳述、至淤正式談判則將俟星期五日三國代表舉行會議時方行開始、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）艾登爵士昨晚抵此、將於今晨與賴伐爾外長舉行預備談話、晨報希望兩人之談話、能闡明英國是否準備以經濟利益讓予意國、藉此解决意阿爭端、抑仍拒絕考慮意國要求之政治的解决、日報則稱、英國建議重新分配殖民地為不可能、但可望提出建設性之計畫、許意國在阿比西尼亞獲得一部份經濟利益但該報對於意國是否願接受此項解决辦法、則模稜其詞、蓋意國一再聲明政治的與軍事的控制阿比西尼亞實屬必要也、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）倫敦電稱、艾登爵士將挾解决意阿爭端之重要方案以俱來、引起此間之注意艾氏可於今晚抵此、此間政界期待甚殷、盛傳艾氏將主張重新分派殖民地、以挽回意阿戰事、新聞報稱、英國必須負擔此項建議之代價、而以一部份英屬索馬里讓與阿比西尼亞、巴黎日報謂不得重視此項建議、蓋此項建議未必能較艾登最近在羅馬向墨索里尼提出者更進一步也、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）討論意阿爭端之英法意三國會議、舉行在卽、據晨報駐倫敦訪員所知、英國代表團業巳奉令、在經濟方面覓求一種解决辦法、俾為意阿兩國所能接受、目前意阿爭端之局勢、較之最近數日已有進步、當時英國閣員主張三國會議當僅就法理觀點研究條文、（指一九〇六年英法意三國條約）而不可越出解釋條文之範圍以外、但現則此項態度業已轉變、推厥原因、實係不管部大臣艾登之功、緣艾氏曾經指出歐洲國家調解意阿爭端若歸失敗、則其影響及於國聯會與集體安全制度者實至嚴重也、據晨報訪員所知、艾登業已奉令便宜行事、惟政府仍囑其審愼將事耳、又據巴黎迥聲報駐倫敦訪員宣稱、「英國不管部大臣艾登今日與賴伐爾總理兼外長商談阿比西尼亞問題時、擬提出一種强有力之理論、以勸法國聽從、卽法國苟不贊助英國之見解、而對意阿之衝突不加反對、則歐洲集體安全制度必受致命之傷、英國將退處幕後、卽使法國受德之威脅、亦不出而助法、至於維持奧國獨立之工作、英國亦將置之不問不聞、槪括言之、英國對於德奧合併一事、將不復予以反抗、一聽德國自由行動是也、上項消息、英京人士現均不加諱飾矣」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國三項建議　意能否接受尚屬疑問</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國報紙競爭評論巴黎之三國會議、但態度頗為謹愼、對於會議之結果均不作預測、外國報紙所載之解决辦法均被斥為無稽、惟意大利日報詳細討論英報所載解决意阿爭端之三項主要建議、第一以巨大經濟利益讓予意國、第二規定意國如承認不向阿國開戰、則重新厘定代管地及殖民地、使意國亦蒙其益、第三由國聯代管阿比西尼亞、其他意國報紙亦均登載此項建議、但均未提及意政府將予以接受或拒絕云（十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>謀陸軍統制强化　日陸相暫不引退　三長官會議决定方針　嚴誡各部屬肅正軍紀</h3>
<p>（東京）林陸相關於今次不祥事件、痛感責任之重大、自事伴發生以來、考慮其進退問題、然最近覺悟統制陸軍之使命、比責任問題更為重大、於是决意先行確立統制陸軍之根本方針、陸相擬於本日訪問岡田首相、表示其關於統制軍部之意見、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）陸軍為講求永田中將遭難事伴之善後處置、及積極的統制部內方針起見、决定俟閑院參謀總長本日由箱根歸京、開三長官會議、屆時閑院總長、林陸相·渡邊教育總監·橋本軍務次官·杉山參謀次長·今井軍務局長等出席、先由林陸相詳細說明至現在止、己判明之永田中將遭難事件及其後之部內就制等、對其對策陸相則表示所懷抱之方針及其貫澈之决心、次卽以此為基礎、加以愼重審議、確立三長官一致之最高方針、於陸軍省參謀本部教育總監部三者强固的聯携之下、由軍政軍令教育三大部門着着實行、藉以確立部內之統制、林陸相對於此事亦不輕於言辭、無論世評如何、决貫澈所信、以身許國、卽其他之長官及先輩方面、亦抱同樣之感、故林陸相於三長官會議席上、絕不方言及進退問題云、（十四日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）林陸相十四日下午一時半邀請參謀總長閑院臨陸相官邸、並請教育總監渡邊大將來邸舉行三長官會議、林陸相先報吿永田軍務局長遇刺事件眞相甚詳、其次表示維持軍規嚴肅之必要、披瀝統制軍部之信念、參謀總長及教育總監均表示同意、於是三人以愼重態度恊議之結果、决定如次根本方針、至二時許始散會、（一）為振作國軍士氣、保持嚴肅規律起見、不許軍人輕舉盲動、應以嚴正態度統制國軍、發揮其眞面目、（二）三長官對於其管下全部隊發出訓令、嚴守軍規、以期澈底統制事業、（十四日日聯電）</p>

<p>（東京）林陸相日夜奔走、力謀收拾時局統制軍部、陸軍首腦部及政府方面亦極力援助陸相、俾逹統制國軍之大目的、然陸相本人認今次事件、有自建國以來未曾有之重大性質、日前更換教育總監之際、陸軍內部受大衝動、而事件在其直後發生、故其心中似有斷然辭職决意陸相得政府及陸軍首腦部之援助進行統制軍部方針、而待一切吿一段落後、照其决意引咎辭職、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本時報謂外人觀察者以為日本陸軍之內訌、乃保守派與急進派之互爭權力、此實根本錯誤、永田實為林陸相之心腹、對於林陸相禁止陸軍干預政治政策贊助甚力、此項政策引起陸軍中若干分子强烈之反抗、彼等以為目前國內與國際之局勢、急需陸軍更大之活幼與參與國家之政務、陸相則决計維持陸軍僅為有實力之戰鬥機關、而不與聞外務、蓋信軍人之政治活動足以背離民意、並使軍人成立黨派也、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>兇犯預審為期兩月　年內可宣判</h3>
<p>（東京）暗殺永田前軍務局長之犯人相澤中佐、曾由東京憲兵隊調查大致情形、卽收押於第一師團衛戍刑務所附與該師團軍法會議、該管官員師以第一師團　務部長島田朋三郎為檢察官、並任命該師團法務官岡田知一為預審官、經烏田檢察官之手、然後將案件移歸預審、由鬧田預審官調查後、再將被吿移交檢察官、附帶檢察官之意見書的向師團長提出、而採取正式起　手續、以便開始軍法會議　步驟如此、惟該管官員鑑於事件之性質、從速行使調查、擬在此兩個月左右、務將辦理事項完結、是以預審之决定或可格外提早、於年內得以宣吿判决、（十四日日聯電）</p>
<h3>維持世界銀價　美國大批購銀　平均每日二百萬盎斯　倫敦市塲感不安</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日據此間消息靈通者稱、美國為維持世界銀價起見、每日竟進現銀二百萬盎斯之多、以前且曾二次大批購進、以阻北銀價暴跌、其中一次所購之數量竟達五千萬盎斯云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）聞美財部今日在紐約以六角七分六二之價格、購進白銀約三十二萬盎斯後、又以六角七分一二之價格購進二十五萬盎斯、查以前購進國外大條之價格為六角八分、說者謂若干操業者逆料美財部卽將提高銀價、故造成勢力偉大之投機地位、財部茲有鑒於此、故不欲在其前所固定之價格上再予以援助、其目的在淘汰投機家、同時並以較低價格續購白銀云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約商梭探悉美財部現已在外國市塲停止購銀、聞華盛頓欲取消政府根據一九三四年購銀法案而定之購銀程序、此種消息紐約銀行界有信為確實者、並聞政府在本屆國會期中不擬設法廢止購銀法案、但僅悄然終止其購銀程序、至於購銀俾成立金銀四與一比例之義務、則將展至將來履行之云、（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財部今日估計、政府自實施購銀計畫以來、獲利達美金二一六·五六七·〇六七元、該項鉅利之來源、係因照市價購進、而以每盎斯一元二角九分之價格鑄幣、據稱所獲利益之中、一四七·二九九·八二三元為由購買世界現銀而得、其餘則為本國之生銀、綜計美國鑄幣利益共達六萬萬元、如以此數與購銀計畫之利益相比、可見財部最近活動之程序為如何矣、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）參院銀派領袖湯默斯今日以銀價低落原因歸之於財部停購現銀、卽財部以低價收購亦非購銀法之本意、湯氏云、「若購銀之後窖而藏之、卽毫無　義、吾人所需要者為銀價之上升而已、如中國與英磅發生關係、則吾人可坐享其利、因如金價上升、吾人卽為存金最多之國家、此固予所不欲反對者也、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日電聞報新聞紀事報每日郵報及財政新聞報對於銀價跌落、均撰文加以評論、財政新聞報謂、「美國當局業已表明、並不準備永久維持銀價在某一平準、因此投機份子脫卸存貨、爭前恐後、故一般銀商對於白銀地位、現均多少表示不安」云云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）金融記者對於白銀之將來趨勢、意見不一、泰晤士報稱多頭地位雖已大减、殆猶不小、美當局將來如自覺不致被迫以吸收巨量白銀、則或將改變其抑低銀價之政策云、金融時報稱、此後數日內投機家恐將爭先買出其已購之白銀、果爾、則欲免銀市完全崩潰、唯賴美財部積極援助耳云、彙聞報稱、昨日美國官塲吸收白銀在一千一百萬與一千二百萬盎斯之間、估計在過去兩月內美國在倫教市塲　約購銀二萬萬盎斯、多頭　機家之地位殆已完全了結、銀市脚地旣已澄清、銀價之回漲固亦意中事也云、每日電聞稱、美國白銀與政治勢力相消長、羅總統現遽於進退維谷之地位、渠不欲付非必要之高價以購白銀、然亦知如不大批收買、則銀市將凌亂無序、故渠以溫和逐漸跋低購價之方法以解决此難題、而投機家乃受其加惠矣、究竟結果如何、現難逆睹、東方猶有大批存銀、其出售與否尙未可知、今後事熊繫於不可思議的東方之舉動、及不可思議的羅總統之政策、孰能預料之哉云、（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>上海市禁烟问题　蔡局長昨廣播演講　公安局禁烟勸導隊今晨出發宣傳</h3>
<p>市公安局局長蔡勁軍昨（十四）日午後四時半、在中西大藥房廣播電台、演講上海市禁烟問題云、（一）親愛的同胞們、今天承上海市教育局約勁軍來擔任播音演講、見弟得到這麼一個很好的與全市的同胞講話的機會、感覺非常的榮幸、今天所講的題目、是「上海市禁烟問題」、在未講到禁烟之先、我們應當知道鴉片烟的害處、事實吿訴我們、一個有了鴉片烟嗜好的人、他的體格是孱弱的、經濟是困難的、道德是淪喪的、因為鴉片烟是含有嗎啡的毒質的、嗜好的人中了這種烟毒、在生理上發生了病態的變化、康健的人變為有病的人、微病的人變為病重的人、病重的人變為不可醫的人、所以抽烟的人、總是骨瘦如柴、精神萎靡的、同時、各位都知道、有了烟癮的人、天天是要抽烟的、因此鴉片烟便變為日常不可缺的必需品了、有錢的人、增加了這種負担、不出幾年、家產蕩然、淪為乞丐貧窮的人、生活一定更加困難、到了沒有辦法的時候、他的最後手段、便是鋋而走險、為非作歹、這是因為抽鴉片烟的人增加了負擔、經濟困難所產生必然的現象、再則抽鴉片烟的人、不論他的學問怎樣的充足、技能如何的熟練、在體格上精神上是不能再做生產的工作的、加以需錢買烟、增加負擔、在這兩個條件之下、便構成他們喪失道德的行為、不顧禮義廉恥、也不知道什麼是法律、我記得我從前，曾經審問一個强盜、我問他為什麼要做强盜、他說、「他本來是富家子弟、在大學讀過兩年書、因為抽鴉片烟的緣故、把家產散盡了、後來憑着在大學裏所學得的本領、去謀職業、可是等到職業謀到了的時候、不是他自己的體力精神不支、便是人家嫌惡他抽鴉片、終於失業了、始初還靠鼠竊狗偷的行為來維持他的生活、後來鄰居知道、防範得很　生計無着、肚子餓得沒有辦法、因此跟着一班壞人去榦强盜的勾當了」、這是抽鴉片烟的人墮落的實例、又過去公安局拘留所裏面抽、片的犯人特別多、也是一個明證、由此、可知抽鴉片實在自殺的、罪惡的行為、抽鴉片不但是自殺的、罪惡的行為、並目是民族衰弱的原因、因為抽鴉片烟的人、不僅他的本身中了烟毒、他的子孫也給他遺傳下來一個孱弱的身軀、低能的智慧、惡劣的習慣、陷於不能自拔的境遇、抽鴉片烟的人、在精神上是萎靡的、在物質上是不生產的、體格是孱弱的、他的子孫是不振作的、所以如一個民族抽鴉片的成分多、這個民族一定是衰弱的、因為他喪失了民族的「實力」、我們的民族、自從鴉片烟戰爭失敗以來、民族萎靡不振、受人欺負、這就是鴉片烟的毒害所給予我們的結果、因為鴉片烟所給予個人的、社會的、民族的毒害、是這樣的嚴重、所以禁烟是一個嚴重的問題、只有禁烟可以减少社會的罪惡、只有禁烟才能復興中華民族、（二）禁烟的問題、旣然是這樣嚴重、現在我們來檢討一下、過去禁烟的政績、自鴉片戰爭以來、不論滿淸政府也吧、北洋軍關時代也吧、鴉片烟是懸為例禁、抽鴉片是犯罪的、受處罰的、可是經過了不少的年數、每年處罰過不少的烟犯、然而到現在、一點成效都沒有、這是什麼緣故呢、推求牠的原因、大約是因為不知道立法嚴、禁絕的期限短、絕不計及應有的過程、旣沒有嚴厲的統制的設施、也沒有一貫的有效的步驟、而社會一般民衆、又不恊助政府、是以因循遞嬗、日甚一日、到現在還未禁絕、我們將委員長看透了這一點、所以下了很大的决心、採用曩年國民會議　决的六年禁絕方案、决定自本年始、至二十九年止、為禁絕期間、採取兩個辦法、就是一方面提倡新生活運動、轉移社會風氣、鼓勵民衆協助政府禁烟、一方面用科學的方法、用政府的力量、去强迫烟民戒除、的確、禁烟這件事情、社會所負的責任、比政府所負的責任還要大、革命先革心、變政先變俗、變俗就是轉移風氣、轉移風氣、就要靠社會的力量、社會對於抽鴉片的人、雖然沒有獎勵、但是也沒有制裁、抽鴉片的人、得到了一種寬恕、因此、他們的數量的增加、便日有可觀了、就以上海地方來說、據公安局緝獲鴉片曁烈性毒品的統計、二十一年緝獲人犯千五百名、二十二年緝獲人犯六千一百七十六名、二十三年緝獲人犯六千九百五十六名、照這樣看來、烟民一年比一年增加、是無疑義的、這就是社會制裁不力的一個明證、我們都知道、纒足的風習、是從五代以至令日、有七八百年的歷史、自民國以來、提倡放足、不二十年、而幾百年的纒足風習、即被革除，因為社會上大家都認為這件事　對的、以小腳為美的觀念、也轉變過來了、一般的靑年男子、非天足的女子不結婚、而一般小脚的女子、大有嫁不出之虞、因此、風氣轉移了、已經經足的女子即刻放足、沒有纒足的女子、不敢再纏了、這是社會制裁所收到的效果、兄弟去年在江西的時候、曾到臨川縣去參觀、那裏有一個鵬溪鎭實騐區、是推行新生活最力的一個地方、尤其是對於禁烟、該區所內有一房間、是堆積滿了　槍大　有千餘條、據說是由他們的親屬、自動繳來的、地們對於禁烟所採的辦法很妙、係由新生活運動會主辦的、他們組織一個婦女生活改進會、禁絕鴉片是該會最主要的工作、利用家庭中的婦女作為禁烟的督促者、做母親的對於兒子、做妻子的對於丈夫、做妹妹的對於哥哥等等、如有鴉片的嗜好、初則苦口相勸、言語勸　不動、繼之以哭、哭之不動、繼之以絕情、要知　父母兄弟姊妹夫妻、都是一種天賦的感情、假　將這感情斷絕了、不論那一方都感覺到痛苦的、家家如此、沒有一個人對於烟民是同情的因此收效甚大、如果這樣還不戒除、便施行第二步辦法即家庭斷絕他的經濟關係親友不予接濟、使他有非戒烟無以為生的感覺、誰不愛惜名譽、認不愛惜生命、是以鵬溪鎭不到幾個　、全鎮的烟民、在這種嚴密的監督中、完全戒絕了、這是一個很可以取法的例、由此可以知道社會制裁的力量了、（三）現在說到我們的上海、全國最大都市的上海、牠有三百多萬的人口、是中國經濟文化的中心、也是華洋雜處的處所、中外觀瞻所繫民族興衰所倚、禁烟的迫切、更不用話了、所以本年七月一日成立禁烟委員會、討論禁煙辦法、並決定分期施戒、第一步将烟民全數登記、待登記截止後、再查明吸食鴉片的人數、與需要土膏的數量、根據統計數字、限定土膏行店家數、逐步縮减、以至鴉片禁絕為止、公安局係奉令辦理烟民登記、經於七月二十二日張貼佈吿、同時分令各分局所隊、自即日起開始實行烟民登記、現在來登記的、已不在少數了、登記的作用、在統計烟民眞確數目、以便分期戒除、登記的日期、照章定為六個月、自七月起至九月底止為自動登記期間、本局組織勸導隊、來勸導烟民登記、自十月至十二月底止為强迫登記期間、本局就捕獲人犯、勒令登記、同時本局擬有三種登記聲請書、一為請領普通戒烟執照聲請書、二為請領貧民執照聲請書三為請求戒烟聲請書、惟請領貧民戒烟執照者、是否貧民、並須繳保證書一紙、送局核發執照、其請求戒烟的人、亦照章先要登記、聽候傳送戒烟醫院、幷須塡具保證書一紙、保證戒斷後、可以隨時調騐、决不再吸、此外如烟民旅行時、得將所領執照、呈繳本局懷給旅行證總之手續務祈　單、方法則求週密、本局現定烟民登記須知幷訂定限期辦理吸戶登記施行細則、將一切聲請登記的手續、科罰的規定、以及處理烟案的情形、都記載在內、已經派警挨戶散發、想各位都見到、不必再來詳細的說明了、（四）但是禁烟是轉移風氣的大舉、復興民族的偉圖、單靠政府的力量、是不够的、必須全市的烟民、大家覺悟、全市的同胞大家協助、才能達到目的、對於這一點的理由、在前面已經說過、在這裏不必重說了、全市的同胞們、我們應當認淸楚了上海市禁烟問題的嚴重性、我們應當明白我們的責任、希望有鴉片嗜好的同胞們、趕快自己覺悟、到公安局來登記請戒、希望沒　鴉片嗜好的同胞們、努力推行新生活、協助政府禁烟、轉移社會風氣、尤其希望全市的女同胞們、組織婦女生活改進會、倣效江西臨川縣鵬溪鎭的辦法、督促家人戒烟、我相信在六年期內、一定可以戒絕的、這是市民的福音、復興民族的關鍵、（完了）</p>
<p>大公社云、市公安局遵照蔣委員長行營所頒限期禁烟章程條例案、即實施本市禁烟運動、規定第一期、自本年七月起至九月底止、為烟民自首期限、第二期十月一日起至十二月底止、為烟民强迫登記期限、公布辦法後、即開始登記、市公安將限期內肅情烟民、戒絕黑籍嗜好、並使民衆注意禁烟意義起見、特令飭全市各區分局區所、組織勸導隊、業已成立、定今晨起、全體出發、担任勸導宣傳工作、宋子文·李石曾·　民誼·昨乘夜車出京、今晨抵滬、</p>

<p>市長介紹</p>
<p>吳市長復起立介紹梅博士演說、謂梅先生此次提前山歐洲返國、因鑒於國內水災嚴重、不容坐視、特計　演義務戲助振、凡我市民、不祇贊助進行、且應設法募振、長江流域鄂·贛·皖·等省、二百九十縣中、有一百五十縣罹災、陸沉　禍、較民二十年尤甚、滬地雖屬苟安一時、但將來必受影響、凡事須打大算盤、不可斥於小利、上海譬諸一魚、而外埠各地如水、水竭則魚死、營業發達、市面方能繁榮、願諸位亟起救濟災黎、</p>
<p>梅氏演說</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士於是起立演說云、蘭芳在今年二月、承蘇聯文化恊會聘請、帶同敝劇團到俄表演、完畢後、又同余上沅先生赴歐遊歷、當初動身時、承吳市長及諸先生在此為蘭芳錢別、今又蒙諸先生盛大欺待、而劉才吳市長等又　蘭芳設了許多獎　之話、使蘭芳十分慚愧及感激、回想去年蘇聯政府正式邀請蘭芳之時、心中頗為懷疑、幷加恐懽、因蘇聯係世界上戲劇最發達之國家、中國戲是不是可以去給人家看呢、有否給人家研究的價值、總覺是一個疑問、後來因為政府方面還有顏大使、同上海戲劇協進會諸公、均認為旣是蘇聯政府一番盛意、在兩國的文化同邦交上多少總不無有關係、所以對蘭芳都非常熱心鼓　、因此蘭芳也就增加了好多勇氣、在决定之前、蘭芳也曾同鮑大使談過幾次、鮑使亦認為中國戲有許多特點、是很可以介紹到蘇聯去、而且鮑使說蘇聯人民很想研究中國之戲劇、都很熱誠的、盼望我去、所以蘭芳想想倒不能够辜負人家的這一番厚意、所以才决定冒險前去、蘭芳是二月二十一日從上海動身、沿路的天氣、倒並不十分的冷、二月十二日到了莫斯科、在莫斯科稍微休息了幾天、就登台表演、當開幕之日、蘇聯政府請顏大使在台上向民衆公開的演說、並由文化協會會長阿洛西夫先生登台介紹、這都是很值得紀念的、我們在俄國表演、每天觀衆、都是很擁八天、後來因為有好許多人還沒有聽到、所以文化協會來同我商議、並再三要求多唱幾天、我當時也就答應、所以又續演了七天、一共是唱了十五天、在表演之時、蘇聯的民眾對於我們都很有一種熱烈之表示、這些情形呢、聽說塔斯社同中央社所發出的電報很多、國內的報紙登載得也很詳細、現在我也不多說、比較要緊的呢、就是各大報紙上所登載的那些蘇聯有名的戲劇家。文學家。對於中國戲的許多評論、他們把中國戲裏的優點、發現得很多、我現在把他們的話簡單的來說幾句、他們說、中國戲之最大長處、大致說來約有三點、第一、是中國戲裏面包含有歌唱·道白·舞蹈·武技、是一種綜合的藝術、都認為這是中國戲的一個特點、第二、是中國戲最合於舞台經濟」的原則、比方說表現一個船、在中國戲裏面只要用一把船槳、就可以代表一個船、而且可以做出許多許多的水上的姿勢來、若是眞要弄個眞船上去、恐怕就沒有這樣的方便、而且在覜衆的眼光裏面所得的印象、同是一個船、但是在舞台的方式上、就分出「經濟」同「不經濟一之判別、所以這一點呢、也是他們很認為持長的、第三點就是中國演員訓練、是非常的深刻的、有一天、我們在戲劇公會開了一個研究會、我們把中國演員在學戲時期所經過的各階段同各種之工夫訓練、表演給他們看、所以他們均知道在中國戲裏面、每一個演員、總得經過六七年的訓練工夫、才能够登台、在台上的一舉一動、如台步·身段·都是很嚴格的、而且有一定的現律的、所謂有地方、有尺寸、一點不能含糊的、可是一種活發之運用、全在演員表演之天才、這幾點都是他們很贊美之處、蘇聯最有名的戲劇家梅雅霍爾德先生說、將來還要採取中國戲的這種方式、來編演他們的戲、並且說不久就可以實現、還有世界電影名導演愛森斯坦因先生亦云、中國戲的方式、是很可以用之於電影、他們難然這樣說、不過蘭芳對於中國戲劇到底怎麼樣、還是不敢自信、這兩位的言論、果能見諸事實、那麼在兩國的文化上或者有一點影響、在俄國演戲的情形、蘭芳已經略為報吿過了、至於他們對於中國戲的評論、在報上低多、也决非一時可以說完的、我預備將來把他翻譯出來、拿來做我們之參考、至於蘭芳這一次在蘇俄承他們的越種招待非常優厚、事先他們政府方面、組織了個招待委員會、向民衆宣傳、當我們動身的時候、是乘蘇聯所派的專輪、沿路並派有黨代表同行照料、到海參崴之後、文化會方面又派了代表來迎接、到了莫斯科、他們所氏衆、都表示歡迎的意思、由此可以看出兩國政府同人民間一種友好的表現、所以蘭芳令天，是應富向蘇聯國家的代表鮑大使表示感謝的、蘭芳在俄國表演後、就到中歐去遊歷、因為時間很短促、也不過是走馬看花而已、所看之戲、大約七八十次、總之、各國的戲劇、有各國的作風、未可一槪而論、至於我在俄國、住的日子比較多點、俄國本來就是世界上戲劇最遠的國家、自從革命後、他們政府、用全副的精神來創造新的戲劇、但是同時、對於他們舊的戲劇文化、依舊的　法子來把牠保存、俄國人的性情、楚非常剛毅的、對於一一切的事情、都肯埋頭去苦幹他們對於戲劇、也一是這樣、單說莫斯科一城、就有七十多個戲院、一全國有戲劇學校兩百多處、學生有兩萬九千多一人、像這樣的努力、我想將來一定有新的收穫同很大的成功、俄國人這種勇猛前進的精神、眞令人偏服至於其他的一切建建設情形、我們也不用多說、單從戲劇上這一點看來、也就司以推想得到了、蘭芳這一次到歐洲去之後、看看人家　戲劇、冉想想自己的戲劇、我覺得中國　、倘若能够經過嚴格的選擇、同新的改進、將來必定可以有更高的地位、不過這種責任是很大的、也决不是蘭芳個人、或是我們戲劇界的力量所能做到的、總還希望社會上的熱心戲劇的諸立先生、大家來共司想個去子將他來整理整理、那末我們中國的戲劇或者有更發達的一天關於這一次出國的經過、同歐洲戲劇界的詳細情形、蘭芳打算將來再把牠寫出來、向諸位先生請教、今天只好稍微的說幾句、有不到的地方、還得請諸位先生原說、今天謝謝諸位先生的盛意、蘭芳尙有一事要奉求於諸位先生的、蘭芳在歸國途中、聽見各省災情奇重、就很着急、等到回上海、又聽見許俊人·王一事·杜月笙·三位先生面吿水災實况、非常的凄慘、蘭芳就自願作比較長時間的義務表演、盡一點心、承許·王·杜·諸公一致贊許、答應由義振會赶緊組織、大約一俟秋凉、即可登台表演、但是蘭芳能）薄弱、災情奇重、市面又適　不好、所以非請諸公先生帮忙不可、如　能够口以多　一文錢、災民就可以多得一分實患、蘭芳　感激不盡了、</p>
<p>胡蝶演說</p>
<p>末主席復介紹胡蝶女士演說謂中國戲劇與外國戲劇不同、尤以電影為最、胡女士從事電影、此次遊俄、必多獲益云、胡女士逐起立略謂、此次歐游歸來、詳細經過、業已先後奉吿、茲略述本人感想如次、蘇俄及歐洲各國、咸以電影為教育　宣傅之工其、分門別、映入銀幕、興棷旣佳旣收　亦宏、願我國亟起仿效、以謀發展、同時　　　當局招待歡迎、良深感激、特藉此機會、向鮑大使致謝，並請將鄙意轉達貴國、此外尙希望在座諸君隨時指教、以匡不逮、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （顏鑫泉）</p>
<p>假使一個過慣了安樂生活的人，而沒有遭逢到痛苦的，那麽他對於自己的安樂生活，一定還以為不滿足；可是在一般和他處境絕對相反的朋友目光中，恰覺得能達到他那樣的地步，已經是萬幸了。</p>
<p>肥皂，雖然可以把它拿來洗滌衣服，和去除身體的汚垢，但是用一塊潔白的綢布，擦上了肥皂，放到最澄淸的水盆裏去洗，可是澄淸的水，依然要渾濁起來，這究竟是誰的汚穢呢？</p>
<h3>朱先生</h3>
<p>— 吉安</p>
<p>在我家的隔壁，有一位姓朱的先生，他的一切言語行動，非常特別，大可以介紹出來，給一般人見識見識，證明在這社會中，怪人實在是到處都有呢。</p>
<p>朱先生是師範畢業生，當他第一次去祖任敎員的時候，眞好像上任做官一樣，身上穿的衣裳，完全重新做起，被褥帳子等等，也無往而不新，他本來是反對穿皮鞋的，然而，這一次却破例了，費了八塊大洋，到上海去買了一雙紋皮的長統皮鞋，他說：「做敎員一定要穿皮鞋，那才顯得出威風呢？」可是，他担任敎員工作，只有三個月的光景，便不幹了，原因是為了有一個學生偸了他一枝鉛筆，他認為世風日下，人心不古，敎員這碗飯，是沒有什麼吃頭的。</p>
<p>朱先生失業之後怎樣辦呢？別人都在替他着急，但是朱先生倒好整以暇的不覺得什麼，每天排了日程表，做他的刻板工作，上一次我到他家裏玩玩，看見他的日稈表上，寫着的是：「每日早上五時起身，練習深呼吸，七時至十時讀經，十時至十二時讀報，一時至三時午睡，三時至五時談論國事，七時至九時靜坐養性……，」我看了他的日程表，不覺暗暗好笑，我想：別人家失了業，便要出門想法子了，而他每天是不出門的做些無聊工作，他的目的究竟在什麽地方呢？</p>
<p>最近，據我的朋友說：「朱先生為了失業以後，經濟拮据，所以比以前瘦得多了。然而我想：旣然這樣，他為什麽遠在家裏做　些無聊的工作呢。</p>
<h3>孝女曹娥</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>前幾天看見報上，載者一段「重建曹江孝女廟」的新聞說：由海上聞人王一亭等發起，已經三載，後來因為市面不景氣，募欽寥寥，不敷至五六萬，直到眼前八月一日，剛纔正殿上得以上梁，可見諸公的熱忱毅力，對於該廟的信仰，實在令人敬佩。</p>
<p>曹娥，不過一個女兒，他的父親，名叫旴，論他的業務，不過能「撫節按歌婆娑樂神」，像個巫者的流亞，（見曹娥碑序），眞是很尋常的家世；不料曹盰在漢安（漢順帝年號），二年五月裏，錢塘江頭迎祭濤神的當兒，（濤神，相傳伍子胥諫吳夫差，賜死，以鴟夷投之江，後素車白馬，時隱時現，越人乃祭之，）竟沈於水，那時候，曹娥年紀，祗得十四歲，曉得父親亡故，日夜在江邊號哭，奔來走去，想尋覓父親，經過了十七天的長時間，終沒有招到，可憐！這一個弱女子，也就縱身一跳，投入江中，擬實地去查個淸楚，五天以後，果眞抱他父親的尸身而上浮；這可見得一片孝心雖脫不了前人的神話作品，但就曹娥的本身講，畢竟是個孝女，無論那個都可以承認吧！</p>
<p>所以從前上虞縣裏的長官度尙，他有一位弟子，叫邯鄲淳，年紀還在弱冠，度尙使淳做一篇曹娥碑文，他遂操筆立就，起先本來是魏朗先做魏朗自知不及他的佳妙，立卽將草稿撕毁了；後來，蔡邕聽了這一回事，忽發好奇心，以為這篇碑文，不可不去一讀，竟連夜趕去，題其碑陰日：「黃絹幼婦，外孫虀臼，」隱著「絕妙好辭」四字，文章的價値，也就可想了，其實沒有像曹娥的孝道，文人的筆，也不能做到這樣，現在，因為七八年前為火所燬，熱心諸君，集欵興築，想見廟貌一新，這塊碑文，摩挲拜讀的，當大有其人哩！</p>
<h3>碼頭晚景</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>上海十六鋪蜒蜿里許的一條外馬路，是給聲個的江輪碼頭和貨棧所佔據，那裏除了招商南站，有寗紹大達兩家公司；寗紹在日暉斜照的午後，是它和時代姑娘一般，百千人羣向伊懷中去投寄；招商大達呢？從申刻時分熱鬧到子夜，伊們如齊國的孟嘗君，抱着化雨普沾主義；沿江碼頭，輝煌着像月亮的電炬把滾滾長流，炫照得白蛇萬道，這裏的夜色，杭唷聲，嘈雜聲，小販叫喚聲，鼎沸地打成一片；我歸途中如循水程，就是搭滬揚綫的小長江輪船，這些晚景，可謂領略到個中深處；大達這兩年經主事者的銳意革新，增設了一座售票間，旅客們附輪北返，先要嘗一回窗口風味，輪公司知道事事鶩新，也高懸着霓虹燈；遠遠的拖來一輛笨重街車，蜂擁上一堆苦力，這個蠅趨蝟集，是挑夫脚夫的一羣；老申報，新聞報，當日夜報，各種小報，是老槍報販發出來的吶喊；蘇州景，無錫景，低啞的破竹管歌唱，是文化街頭書販的水上副業；阿要老牌肥皂，廣東香蕉，這是熙來攘往的食品小販；還有不用聲息代表，和貨郞祖子一般，拿響器來逗引顧客，他們是，「一言堂」的叛徒！物主可以瞞天討價，買主可以着地還錢；直到電車停駛了，夜色深沉了，輪船烟囪中發出獅號虎吼的巨響！他們纔慢慢登陸，可是這剎那間，依然要留戀在躉船邊緣，向着外舷上顧客作最後的兜銷，嗚嗚汽笛聲，發出瀕行的警告了，他們纔拖着笨重的脚步，離開碼頭，個個面龐露着絲絲的微笑，表示他們今夕的白飯或黑飯有了着落；這時候立在艙外的旅人們，各個胸懷中，也似乎在低吟着「別矣上海」。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共仰高風</p>
<p>他這樣的自幸着走了，那個不幸的女子却是一直的送到了我後院子裏居住。張介夫發呆之後，本也抽身向屋子裏走了去了。然而那高跟鞋的響聲，却是最容易觸動他的神經，就立刻回轉身來相迎着。但是他看到這婦人面孔不熟，又是在後面跟着兩綑行李，他就聯想到必是藍專員有關係的人，可不能胡亂的觸犯了，因之板正了面孔，閃到一邊去。那婦人道：這裹就是這幾問屋子嗎？他說着，露出一口南京腔來。介夫更是不敢胡來，料着所猜很對。正好在這個時間，前面的帳房，拿着一捲紅紙進來，笑道：張先生，你不是答應了和我們寫歡迎標語嗎？介夫將胸脯一挺道：那是我義不容辭的，明天來的藍專員，是我們的親戚。說到是我們的親戚這一句，那聲音是非常的饗亮。而且同時將眼睛向那女人偷着射了一下。果然的，這藍專員三個字，送到那婦人耳朶裏去。那婦人似乎也衝動了一下，只是介夫不便多看，也就引了那帳房進屋子寫標語去了。介夫對於這件事是特別的努力，早已就倒好了一碗墨汁，調和得不濃不淡，桌子是擺在屋子中間，將白紙舖着。大小筆發開了許多枝，架在桌沿邊，地下堆了一大堆報紙，都是寫上了大字的，墨汁淋漓。（二九〇）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>其時那些半開放的荷花却實在不再在開放了，它　都在靜悄地的期待着；粉紅色的花蕊，依舊不曾　出全身來。</p>
<p>太陽的光芒躍過了京城內的無數的屋脊，直向西山那邊射去，頤和園也在它的行程中拂過了；最後，太陽上升的速度忽然很驚人地增高了，差不多是在一寸一寸的跳起來，以至照遍了全湖，使湖水完全塗上了一重銀色。</p>
<p>現在太陽已毫無遮　地全身顯露在空中了！</p>
<p>太后所說的奇景這才眞正的出現了！</p>
<p>差不多在同一個時候，太陽在天上全部的透露出來，那湖面上的幾千百支的蓓蕾便也全部的開放了出來；花瓣平平地伸展着，很勻整的貼在綠葉上。最使我驚奇的是何以那些半開放了的蓓蕾在太陽沒有整個湧現之前，樓是那樣的期待着，而待太陽全部掛出來之後，一霎時便又一起開放了；難道說陽光能有催花開放的魔力嗎？自然界的奇蹟，眞有不可思議之處。</p>
<p>荷花通常總是粉紅色的居多，白色的也還不少，但在昆明湖中，却很有幾許為外間所不經見的奇種：這日太后就第一個發現了兩朶稍帶綠色的荷花，伊便忙着指點給我看，並悄悄地告訴我，這是價值極鉅的名種。（三九〇）</p>
<p>社會寫真</p>
<h3>客談官歷</h3>
<p>— 易生</p>
<p>富可逞豪，貴易求富更有權勢，故家有子弟，莫不望其異日做官！民國以來，官的數量日增月盛，竟有「中華官國」之稱，普通的人都可得到一官半職，皆大歡喜！所以北京政府時代有童謠道：「將軍滿街走，司令賤如狗！」那與唐代安祿山作亂時，所有將軍節度使等的吿身纔堪以謀一醉，正相彷彿。照這情形，想要實在靠官吃飯的，那得不有一部份成為災官呢？或者掛了一個官銜嚇嚇老百姓，否則擁着虛名聊以自娛，還行呢！</p>
<p>我有一位表兄，原是作家，據說他也曾做過官，並且兼過差使，這作成我區區也算一個官親了罷，多少沾得一些官氣罷—雖然他本人素不高興別人題起他的官事！前天晚上，我們在無意中談到做官，我纏住他要求見吿他那官的來歷，和他居家不出可以做官的緣故，居然承他直言無諱。</p>
<p>「你要知道我從前頂着某軍參議那名目的經過麼？那時候我的朋友老何，—謹仿「我的朋友胡適之」的口氣—正受任該軍某部部長的差使不久，便承他自動的美意替我弄到那個　號。他雖是一位再來的馮婦，却已好久度着寒士生涯，我們可算是貧賤之交，不但是文字交！那年他發達了恰到上海來，我往旅邸去訪他，果然見他當官長的氣派異乎尋常：遠遠裏有衛士站近屋隅拱衛着在他身子的前後，當我們隨便坐下談天的時候！我知道了他的近狀，向他道了賀便忽忽吿別，原為避免他懷疑我將有什麼干求請託之意。過了沒多天，他駐節到蘇州，却委由設在上海的他屬下的一個機關送達一份聘函到我家來，就算給我那個官樣頭銜。我還記得那送公事的差役是一個年只十三四，北方口音的孩子，却很學會一些官塲的禮貌，滿口「是是是」的，又是「恭喜老爺高升」哩，左一個鞠躬，右一個鞠躬，他的目的在要一些賞錢。那時我的心裏也正覺的痛快，—雖然那個站在客卿地位的參識，官名實無補於饑寒，—老朋友的情意確是豐美；我就一下給了那孩子兩塊錢。他也知足，千恩萬謝而去。</p>
<p>「至於某省政府駐滬特派員這份差使，是一位交換渦蘭譜的同學吳君的來頭。那時他因特種機會在當代理某省府秘書長。想他多份為念我們過去互助的交誼，舉薦我在代主席前，幾乎說得我不輸臥龍鳳鶵之輩，——據他來信所述——結果他把省府的委令附在他的私函內寄到，委令上並有「准月支夫馬費洋一百元」的字樣。這是有給職，因為該省治成立未久，僻處邊陲，省府要我做宣傳工作，並代接洽京滬的公務。過了兩月，我總算做了一些筆頭上的工作，可是那有夫馬費美名的俸給，我疊函託吳君代領匯來，總是只有去雁不見來鴻。不久，該省政局變遷，我的特派員名義未經後任加委，便在「人演淘汰」之列了。</p>
<p>「這兩個不用出門的官職倒也給我實騐了一句俗諺，就是「朝裏無人莫做官」！有什麼意味去談及它呢？像這麽空頭支票性質的官，在本民國何慮可以車載斗量？那還不是混閙一塲麼？」</p>
<p>我聽了，不禁感想到我這表兄的宦位，正好比一個小小的泡沫跟着後浪催推前浪一般的政潮消滅了。日間讀過的日報正放在我面前，我在錯覺中似乎隱約聽得奔騰澎湃的新潮聲發自那報紙折縫裏。</p>

<p>許承擊敗林寶華　許承基四比六　六比四　六比三林寶華</p>
<p>連日劇戰承基减色　前一日、因雨中止、許曾以四比零局勝林寳華、以事屬表演又適天雨、故前次成績、不再繼績、另行重賽、但許因連日劇戰、不無疲勞、故昨日對林　華、表演上大為减色、雖然得勝、其間甚多驚險之處、林寳華表演頗有出人之處、誠所謂雖敗尤　、</p>
<p>林傾全力取第一盤　林寳華昨日之戰許承基、幾抱破釜沉舟之志、其半塲之斬球、正手之猛抽、時置許承基於無可如何之境、許之發球昨日佳者甚少、而抽球尤欠把握、出界野球、不知其數、許先開球、連失二滑四之局第三局林擊敗許之發球、忽一氣直下、連下四局之多、其旁敲側擊之斬球、一再將許擊敗、成四比二之局、許之正手一抽、在界外者不少、林以五比三居先、第十局林發球、各三十時、許在網前竟將極易之殺球送入網內繼復林送一高球、許誤斷為出界、遂以六比四許失去第一盤、</p>
<p>許承基奪回第二盤　第二盤林因首整劇戰之後、巳感有疲勞之色、許鎭靜非凡、不慌不忙、固然以三比一佔優勢、然因雙方錯誤之多、比賽精彩大减、林因不滿意一視綫員之判决、革草將第八局奉送、許以五比三佔先、而以六比四奪回第二盤、在此盤中、許已發現林之斬球、急起應付、然挽救者、仍不多、</p>
<p>第三盤驚險中結束　局面雖甚緊張、許承基之勝、以較有把握、因許並未見聲嘶力竭之態、仍然鎭靜非凡也、第四局因林之發球雙誤及觸網、許　以三比一佔先、但次局發球、許却又意外的失敗、三比三後、許又速得二局、得五比三之數、第九局許發球、以三十四十落後、危險非凡、因次局林發球將成五比五、不料許一擦帶之球、過網而落下、林雖在網前、無如之何也、平等之後、許又連勝二記、以六比三再勝第三局、</p>
<p>許承某林寳華合影（啟昌攝）</p>
<p>邱飛海敗於卡爾生　卡爾生六比二　六比二邱飛海</p>
<p>老邱老去無能為力　卡爾生對邱飛海繼之登塲、邱既前日以七比五六比一敗於許承基、故昨日之敗、亦意料中事、老邱已人老珠黃、在卡爾生拍下、毫無生路、有守不能攻、其唯一對角抽、亦不能制勝、卡發球速度攔網重壓、處處勝邱、第一盤邱先勝一局、四比一後、再勝一局、六比二完畢、第二盤三比○四比一後、各勝一局、亦為六比二、</p>
<p>雙打表演精彩百出　許承基　林寶華六比三　四比六　六比二卡爾生　德孚</p>
<p>許承基出神入化　許承基在單打中未曾盡量發展、雙打登塲、其表演竟有出神入化妙到毫顛之至、林寳華反為所掩、加以對方二人、亦為雙打好手、故雙打乃精彩百出、僅以德孚稍弱耳、許之發球攔網、尤其在後塲之重殺、皆為滬人所僅見、如果許林合作加以訓練、實為一可怕之雙打、第一盤開球皆勝但德孚開球未勝第四局、許林乃以三比一佔先、各加二局成五比三、許開球、六比三勝第一盤、第二盤卡發球失敗、又成四比二、但許林二人、發球亦竟同遭失敗、一可勝之局、遂為對方運勝四局、反以六比四奪去、成各一局面、第三盤許林再接再勵、以五比一、六比二得勝、</p>
<p>許承基定今晨離滬</p>
<p>氣候不佳飛行不宜　賽畢由孫麟方君致詞、感謝各方熱心贊助、代災黎叩謝、繼贈送表演各球員銀杯一隻、以誌紀念、由吳醒亞夫人給獎、至於許承基、昨承譚敬陳其浩殷動挽留、多作表演、藉酬滬上人士熱烈歡迎之盛意、曾托陳其均代探航空消息、以便乘機南飛、免誤船期、茲據陳君詢悉前班載客飛機、中途遇風、沿綫躭擱多時、際茲颺風節候、飛行不宜、不得不打消前議、許歸心似箭、决難多留、定今晨八時搭、渣華公司芝尼加　號、直返爪哇、過港時或登岸表演、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（十）（四）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>水戲暫息之後忽繼以許多枕頭在空中雜沓亂飛，許多着白衣的小精怪各從他們的床裏鼓噪而出，把這些枕頭丢着。道個戰爭發作在幾個房開，沿着樓上的走道，有時且波及到育兒室裏，因被窮追的戰士有時竟退守到這裏來了。最奇怪的，似乎沒有一人對於此種爆發的事或稍介意；沒有人去禁止它，或者稍露驚奇之色。納綏儘在掛起許多手中，毫不間斷，裴夫人儘在檢尋淸潔的衣服，行所無事，一若秩序固絲毫未嘗有所擾亂。不，她竟也自己參加，將一個莽撞的孩子趕出房外，拿起他所丢在她身上的枕頭反向他丢去。</p>
<p>「他們倒不會受傷嗎？」乃德問道，他睏着看着，笑得已不可開交了。</p>
<p>「呀，决不！我們准許一次枕頭戰爭在每星期六的晚上。枕頭套明天本要掉換了；幷且在孩子們洗澡以後又可助血脈運行，多得一點暖氣；所以我自己頗喜歡這個的，」裴夫人說着，同時又在忙碌整理一打的襪子了。</p>
<p>「多麼一倘極可愛的學校呢！」乃德贊嘆之極不覺說了這麼一句。</p>
<p>「這是一個奇怪的學校，」裴夫人笑說道；你得知道我們不相信定了太多的規則或太多的功課，徒然使孩子受苦。我起初禁止穿了睡衣起來胡鬧；可是，謝謝你，這是完全沒用的。他們竟像是玩具裏箱中的傀儡，才放進去，便會跪起來的。因此我和他們定約：我於每星期六晚上許他們一刻鐘的「枕頸打仗；」他們允許在其他的晚上安安靜靜去睡覺。我試了一下，結果是靈的。假如他們不守他們的約言，便沒得游戲：假如他們守住，我便藏過那些玻璃器具，將燈放在安全的去處，便儘讓他們恣　大鬧一下。」</p>
<p>「這是一個美妙的計畫，」乃德說道，覺得他願加入到這一塲的胡鬧，但又不敢在第一夜裏就作這麼的請求。因此他祇睡着欣賞這幅情景，——那確是一幅活躍的情景呢。</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>兩把刀和一個瓶鉗</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>提倡國貨，誰的力量最大呢？吾說拿着兩把刀和一個瓶鉗的這般人最大。</p>
<p>第一把刀，是拿剪刀的成衣匠。譬如有一天成衣匠起來做一個大集會，議决了一個同業公約說：「從今以後，非國貨衣料，一概謝絕承製。」這樣一來，任你怎樣頂括括頭號時髦的公子小姐，不能不屈服於成衣大司務的剪刀風下。也許國貨的大成功，倒是出於成衣匠之手。聽說某處有許多成衣匠，己在實行，並且遇到一般洋化的公子哥見摩登女子，以洋貨衣料交託裁製時，雖不一定要拒絕，但總是宣布出來說：某家某夫人，某府某小姐舍國貨不用，而用外貨云云，這樣一來，大家有些戒心，認為拿剪刀的人，發生了愛國心，倒有些可怕的。</p>
<p>第二把刀是裁切紙張削尖鉛筆的朋友。他們在用刀切紙或削筆時侯，如果存了决心，不切洋紙，不削洋筆，那麼至少中國的文具業，可以有些起色，一般將要關門的紙廠，或者不致沒有辦法。這把刀，也該要謹愼些呢？」</p>
<p>第三拿着瓶鉗開汽水橘子水啤酒等等的朋友，請你在開瓶以前，靜默半分鐘，看看瓶上的商標，是國貨非國貨，倘使不是國貨飲料，吾勸你不要輕易去開這瓶塞。尤其是一般做下大夫和堂倌的，不要把小銅錢塞住了心，像發狂似的，把各國汽水啤酒亂開亂倒，來替洋商作推銷員。怡怡館主</p>
<h3>救國應自我做起</h3>
<p>— 恰恰館主</p>
<p>顧事林先生有言曰：「天下興亡，匹夫有責。」如今我國是內憂外患，交相煎迫。天災人禍，頻年迭出。這樣的情狀，如果聽其下去，勢必亡國！凡屬國人，豈可坐視不救？</p>
<p>但是，「救國」！「救國」！你勸我救國，我也勸你數國。大家只知道注重於別人救國，而不知道注重於自己救國。這樣的「救國」，結果是你騙我，我騙你而已。「救國」也有變做「亡國」的可能！</p>
<p>現在別的不說，就說「國貨救國」這一回事罷。啊！大家要提倡「國貨」啊！國家之所以弄得這樣貧弱，是由於大家不知道提倡「國貨」的緣故啊！於是乎，你勸我要提倡「國貨救國，我也勵你要提倡「國貨」救國。可是，實際上大家眞的提倡「國貨」救國嗎？不，大家都在提倡「洋貨」亡國，，朋友，你不要怪我這話說得過火。事實吿訴我們，的確是這樣哪！你如果不信的話，那便請你奮一查過去兩年——「國貨年」和「婦女國貨年」——的舊賬看，究竟結果的成績是怎樣？唉！不是「洋貨一的「入超，」是有增無减嗎？「洋貨」的「入超」，存贈無减。愈使整個的中國，奄無生氣！到處只聽到「破產」，鬧着「不景氣」。細想起來，這實在是由於大家救國無誠意，表面上是你勸我，我勸你。實際上是互相欺騙，互相利用而已！長此以往，豈非「救國」也有變做「亡國」的可能？</p>
<p>所以，在下的愚見，是「救國應自我做起」。換句話說，便是為今之計，唯有各人自勉自，纔可以救國。「國貨救國」，也是這樣。不必專注重別人，不可專督責人家。只要自己能彀誠意救國，能彀認眞提倡「國貨」就得。「人如此，人人這樣。那麼，「國貨救國」的目的，終有達到的一天。否則，不過是說說罷了。現在這個「學生國貨年」，已經過去四分之三快了。那麼，還有這四分之一的歲月，便希望大家用這「救國應自我做起」的精神來，各人加緊自我努力罷！</p>

<h3>兩件值得欣慰的事</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>「提倡國貨，是一件永久的工作，並不是某一年某一時的事，我們無論在什麼時候，無論在什麼地方，隨時隨地要把提倡國貨這一件事，放在心頭上，一遇到機會，便要設法宣傳，使咱們中國的國貨運動，在我們努力提倡之下，得到良好的效果，偉大的成績。」這幾句話，是記者時常和一般熱心於國貨運動的朋友們，所時常說起的。</p>
<p>最近，我發現咱們中華民國的國貨運動，有兩件值得欣慰的事，值得在這里大書特書的，現在寫在下面，以見咱們中國的國貨運動，經過了若干時的努力，許多人的提倡，現在的確已經收到相當的效果了。</p>
<p>第一件事情便是入超的减少，根據國際貿易局國際貿易週報的報吿，我國上半年之外貨輸入，總數為五四五·四五五·二九五元，輸出總數為二五九·三六九·六七二元，結果入超額為二八六·〇八五·六二三元，上年同期之輸入額為五六九·八四九九·八三六元，輸出數為二六八·五四四·七一七元，入超總數為三〇一·三〇〇五·一二三元，去年之上半年，與今年的上半年此較，其入超的數目，今年上半年是减少了一五·二一九·五〇〇元，這不是一件植得欣慰的事嗎？可知提倡國貨，只要能繼續不斷的努力，一定能收到效果的。潘仰堯先生脫：「我們對於提倡國貨，一定要有一分力，做一分事業，無論如何，做總比不做好。」這幾句話，是很有深義的，而今而後，我希望大家抱定一個苦幹實幹硬幹的决心，來替國貨運動，多多做一些工作，那末，到了明年統計的時候，一定還有很好的成績，揭示給我們的。</p>
<p>第二件事情，便是國貨捲烟的大團結，我們知道，國貨界同業的團結，是一個很有效果很有實力的組織，最最不好的，便是同業的競爭，同業的互相殘殺，天虛我生先生說：「同業競爭，是國貨事業的死證。」這句話，是很有至理的，現在國貨捲烟事業，首先覺悟起來，這眞是一個很好的現象，很好的組織，從今而後，我相信，國貨的捲烟業一定會有長足的發展，非常的孟晋，我希望因為國貨捲烟業的團結，而影響到別的國貨事業，也繼續的團結起來，互相議定出品的標準，商量推銷的門徑，研究貨物的改良，訂定一致的售價，凡此種種，如能按步做去，國貨事業，那裏會立足不往呢？所以，我一方面對於國貨捲烟事業的團結，表示非常的贊成，同時我却尤其希望其他各業也繼著團結起來，共同站在一條戰綫上，為國貨事業而努力，為國貨事業而奮鬥，那是我十二萬分希望着的事。</p>
<p>拉雜寫來，已經佔了不少的篇幅，抱歉之至，最後，我誠懇的祈禱，我的希望，不要成為幻想，總要有事實的表現才好。</p>
<h3>寫給莘莘學子們</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>駒光如駛！剎那間又暑假到了！莘莘學子們，欣然歸去，趁這暑假光陰，究竟作何工作呢？筆者不敏，敬為學子們，借箸而籌可乎？</p>
<p>今年「是學生國貨年」，顧名惡義，學生對於國貨運動，曾否努力遇？這是應該反躬自省的，學生國貨年的歲月，已逝去一半多了！那麼在這暑假期裏，應多做些提倡國貨的工作，筆者的管見如次。</p>
<p>（一）編製國貨調查表</p>
<p>吾人日常所必需，吃的，用的，穿的，國貨色色俱全，有的反而超過舶來品的佳呢，但是著名的國貨，腦筋裏固然印象極深，其餘名自繁多，記不勝記！那麼國貨調奪表的編製，是亟不容緩了！如國貨誕生的地名，產額狀況，供求情形，優劣比較，價格比較，國人喜用與否的原因……；總之，愈詳愈好。</p>
<p>（二）諫勸家長購買國貨總動員你們的爸爸，媽媽，姊姊，和伯叔父母等，如果發見嗜買舶來品的，你們應當委婉陳述用國貨的好處，倘使一而再，再而三的沒有生效，你們不妨兵諫，所謂兵諫，見外國貨摔掉牠！摔掉之後，或被打駡，你們再泣諫，家長未有不動心而從善如流的！</p>
<p>（三）組綫暑期學生消費合作社每一區域而同鄉同里的學生，應不分畛域（不同校的）大家聯合起來，拿出儲蓄的零用錢，集合成小資本，組織一「暑期學生消費合作社」關於各個人自修用品和開學後應需的文具，書籍，筆墨等，整批向國貨公司去批發，旣節省零買的價昂費，又可實習經商經騐，必推一年長而幹練誠實的領導，女同學亦不妨參加，因為女子對內部辦事，較男的精細，耐久，「讀書不忘國貨運動」的確可以實現了！他如注意海關貿易册上的入超情形，世界各國人民愛用國貨比較圖，關於國貨的各項統計，學子們可以努力的着手工作了！我期待着有驚人的成續！</p>
<h3>改良絲綿製法</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>絲棉為浙省富產品，禦寒之效用，輕而且暖，價亦甚廉，勝於呢絨皮貨，惟惜製法不良，往往日久吐油，泛出黃斑以致售價低落，海寗絲棉廠，因此函請機聯會轉乞天處我生為之設法，業經多次試騐，確實成功，每一斤絲棉在製造時卽將蠶蛹油提去，並行漂白，所費成本不及一角，卽可永不變色。並能增加韌力光澤，因念鄉間婦女，大都墨守成法，不知改良，一經變黃，欲圖捕救，卽大費事。故宜在初製造時，趁其未乾行之，庶成品可以一律，用特公開如下，以供有識者之傳潘採用。</p>
<p>應用器具手續，悉照普通方法，卽以繭子入湯燒煮，照常用碱煮開，剝出蠶蛹，成功手　之後，每五　為一張，每二十張為一絞，每以六絞，浸於一斗缸中，原用半鉛桶水，約十五斤，今當於此水中，加入藥品如左：</p>
<p>（堿代劑）每用無水炭酸納八兩，先代於十五斤之水中，後加輕養化鈣四兩，加熱煮沸，靜置俟其沈澱去脚，乃取上淸液以浸六絞絲棉，約經四小時之久，取出用冷水過淸，卽可施行漂白。如不卽漂，則在淸水中久浸無妨，上述卽係自製「苛性鈉液」比用苛性鈉省七折之譜，其目的在使所含蛹油與堿化合而成肥皂，故能洗去，不使殘留於絲棉之中，以致養化變黃發臭，然後施行酸性漂白如左：</p>
<p>（漂白劑）每用『無水亞硫酸鈉』八兩，化水十五斤，成為甲液，另用比重廿度之鹽酸四兩，化水十五斤成為乙液，可用坡杯量取一百六十ＣＣ（卽等於四華兩）乃將已經堿化去油之漂凈絲棉，先浸入甲液中，經過五分鐘取起絞乾，移浸於乙液，亦五分鐘取出絞乾，再以淸水漂洗，卽照常法上　（古飯切）晒乾，便成潔白無瑕之絲棉矣。</p>
<p>上述漂白劑，每用一次後，但於甲液中加『無水亞硫酸鈉』四兩，於乙液中加『廿度鹽酸』八十ＣＣ並加水仍足原量，卽可再用，不必傾棄。故實際上之消費，每次不過半數而已。而且全不多費手績時間，凡用舊法製絲棉者，無不可以照此改良。</p>
<p>應用藥品，我風均已有自造出品，但須蔓批，方得便宜；零購磅數，其價頗是。若照儀器館之化學藥品價目表中計算，則無水炭酸鈉及亞硫酸鈉均每磅一元，廿度鹽酸每磅需五角半，故如小試以覘成效，雖昂無妨。如果大批製造，應以二千斤絲棉為單位，購用無水亞硫酸鈉一箱，計入會五十八元，廿度硫酸兩箱計兩會十四元四角，無水炭酸鈉（卽純碱）四擔半，約三十二元，共一百零四元四角，加裝運等約一百十元，每斤絲棉所用藥品，不及六分，至於輕養化鈣卽是水化石灰，可以就地購用生石灰，每百斤用水四十斤，洒之令其崩解成粉，過篩卽可用矣。</p>
<h3>學生的恥辱</h3>
<p>— 為元</p>
<p>今年稱為學生國貨年。這並不是說：今年只是學生應該盡量購用國貨，而其他各種人可以隨便一點，其實，凡是是國民一律應盡量購用國貨。今年可以稱為學生國貨年的緣故，意在要那班做學生的人這一年中更應有採用國貨的持殊成續。</p>
<p>學生國貨年一半已經過去，試問成績在那裏？</p>
<p>學生是將來國家的基本人員，這是誰都不能否認。如果學生在學生國貨年尙不能盡量購用國貨，那國家的前途看實令人心寒！</p>
<p>別的且不提，單就和我們學生關係最密切的紙類而論。往昔我們演算抄洋文大嘟用的是洋紙。而現在天章紙廠出的練習簿很可用。中國國貨公司經售，價售一角八分左右十二本，比較外國貨廉得多。我平時做中西文剳起或演算都用這種簿子，幷且因牠是國貨，用的時侯非常安心和樂意。我實在想不出適當理由，為什麼我們捨可用的國貨而用洋貨？更令人痛心的。就是知識階級尙且如此，遑論其他？</p>
<p>怎樣知道我們大都還在用洋貨呢？最近上海一家國貨紙廠停工是最有力的證據。紙類與學生的關係要算是最密切的。學生國貨年中外紙暢銷而國貨紙廠倒閉，這是我們做學生的無上的恥辱！茸餘</p>
<h3>國產絲綢</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>因了外國育蠶方法的改良，出口貨物的獎勵，使得我們號稱出口貿易大宗，的蠶絲，在世界市塲上幾無立足之地。外加國人愛穿舶來的毛織物，人造絲的源源輸入，在國內的營業也一落千丈。倘不急思補救，那末不止市塲上國產絲綢絕跡，便是農村中也沒有再幹這栽桑育蠶的勾當。對於生產方面，豈不又多一種刼難嗎小所以我們做國民的，雖然不能立刻做到重握絲業牛耳的地位，至少的限度，應當自己出產，自己服用，不要再讓舶來的毛織品和絲織品和絲織品，來侵佔去自己國內的地位。現在不妨來說說國產絲綢的優點，讓人們去考慮一下。</p>
<p>所稱為國產絲綢，當然是指用蠶絲織造的。凡是用人造絲或攙雜人造絲而經我們織造成的，當然不是準國貨，不能稱為國產了。國產絲綢的優點，一人所知道的是堅牢耐穿和價目低廉；比較人造絲當然是貴一些，比之外國的純粹絲織品，那末便宜了許多。）而合乎科學方面的有幾點：（一）合乎體重。（二）抵禦紫外綫的直射。</p>
<p>要知道衣服和體重的此例，也有重大的關係，人類穿了體重十分之一的衣服，旣能禦寒，也覺舒適。當然，衣服的重量大了，便有種種的損失，行路氣喘，作事不便，容易釀成鬱血症。而絲綢的重量，比任何的衣料（無論棉織維，蔴織維，毛織維）為輕，禦寒的力量却大，一件重祇二三斤的絲棉袍子，比了七八斤重的老羊皮袍子還要暖和，這便是一個明證。所以國產絲綢的輕暖衛生，為任何衣料所不及的。</p>
<p>紫外綫對於人類的健康，關係很重要；不過據衛生家說：「吸收過度，也和海水浴過曬日光一般的不快，而且和健康上也有害處。」人造絹及木棉最能通過紫外綫，而天然絲吸收率最大。所以我們要調節紫外綫的直射，也必須穿國產絲綢。</p>
<p>好了！國產絲綢旣有上述的種種優點，摩登的人們，衛生的人們，便是講經濟的人們，（因為它堅牢難洗。）正不妨多加提倡！</p>
<h3>介紹一個新興的順昌磁器廠</h3>
<p>— 如愚</p>
<p>中國磁業之發展，已有極悠久的歷史。特別是到了十三世紀，發展不特到了極點，並且比較歐洲任何國家還更利害。譬如德國有名的地理學家莉息太哥芬，他游歷中國多年後所留的著作中，關於中國手工業的描寫，特別淸楚。他這：「中國手工業的技術，已到那樣的高，至於每個手工業者，都為他自己置一架自動的工作機子，較之歐洲就高了很多……在每個部門，均有嚴密的分工。」而若克也說，「每一工人，都有他特別技術，有他的特別巧處，這一個人畫鳥；那一個人畫花；這一個人加紅顏料，那一個人上藍顏色；計算起來，直到製造好出賣的時侯，每一件磁器，要經遇五十個工人的手」。</p>
<p>中國磁業的發展，技術之高，旣達到這種程度，而且又有很長遠的歷史，照理中國磁業應該有發展一日千里之勢，永久執有世界磁器生產之牛耳纔是。但翻開海關貿冊子來看，別的貿易入超不說，單只每年磁器之進口來言，其為數已達到可驚的數字，且有增無减。這種情形，如不圖亟行補救，則外磁的輸入，不得不能停止，且必然會進面取得中國磁業原有地位，而將中國舊有磁業排擠於市塲之外。觀於近幾年來，著名中外的景德鎭磁業，貿易情况，日落千丈之勢，便不難想其前途了。所以在現時改進中國磁業一舉，實為急不容緩之圓。</p>
<p>上海一埠，在往年尙無這種製造營業，致大好市塲，拱手讓諸外人之手，眞是可惜可痛的一件事。現在有人感到這種情况的一天天險惡，便不避一切艱鉅而設立一個磁廠——順昌磁廠。以圖補救。其規模現時以係初辦性質，雖不甚大，工人很少，設備也很簡單，但以其所用原料，旣全廠之國產，而磁器式樣，又特別改新，並且大部份是製造外磁輸入的一類所謂洋式用器。其前途之進展，自然不問可知。這點祗要觀於他廠裏定貨粉至沓來，應接不暇的情況，也就可略曉個大概了。</p>
<p>順昌磁廠，旣在這提倡國貨與外貨充斥的情况底下開始前進，他或許中間也要受到阻碍。但我想祇要國人一秉供用國貨之决心，堅持匪懈，而一味的提倡國貨，拒用外磁，則不僅所具的順昌磁能以蒸蒸日上的發展起來，就是中國舊有的磁業，當亦會日有起色逐漸的好轉。因之，幾於此不特希望順昌磁廠努力不懈，以求改進發展。我更望國人能一致的維護這個剛行開花結實的工業，用以來挽回已行失去的利權。</p>

<h3>別字和正字</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>章太炎先生提倡寫正字，他以為寫白話文的人都應該深通「小學」，這才不至於把字兒寫錯，那企圖也還並不小，因為他是想藉此打倒白話文，再抬出文言文來的。致命的煞手是「小學」。</p>
<p>能够深通「小學」，精研字書訓詁，譬如古董商的善於識舊貨，知道牠的來歷一樣，好是的確很好的。不過古董倒底是古董，牠專供玩賞，聊備陳設，也許在要研究古代社會情形的人看來，還有一點用塲，對於眼前的生活，是沒有什麼關係的。所以周鼎到現在也還是周鼎，然而傳國，煎藥，烹茶，燒香的東西，却都已換了名目，變了樣子了。那緣故是要合乎生活的需要：便利，精密。</p>
<p>文字自然也一樣。周朝的大篆，在那時后原也十分文明，而且大家認為便利的，然而現在呢，雅人們請太炎先生寫成對聯，掛上書齋，專供點綴了。日常手頭所用的，倒是幾經變化的正楷，而且還有簡字，別字，一天一天的在變下去。</p>
<p>生活的需要决定了這些，誰也沒有法子想。</p>
<p>據章氏星期講演會里諸君子的意見，以為太炎先生所提倡的，是正字，也就是康熙字典里所說的「當時之字」，並不是古字。然而康熙字典里有許多字，我們現在都不用了，所謂「當時」，所「當」何「時」呢？</p>
<p>倘使不是現在，那就只算過去了。</p>
<p>太炎先生的那篇「白話與文言之開係」文章里說：</p>
<p>「尋常語助之宇，如焉哉乎也，今白話中，焉哉不用，乎也尙用。如乍見熱人而相寒暄曰好呀，呀卽乎字；應人之稱曰是唉，唉卽也字。夫字文言用在句末，如必子之言夫，卽白話之罷字，輕唇轉而為重唇也。矣轉而為哩，說文呂聲之字，或從里聲，相或作梩，可證其例。乎也夫矣四字，僅聲音小變而已，論理應用乎也夫矣，不應用呀唉罷哩也。」</p>
<p>原來我們日常所認為正字的「呀唉罷哩」，據太炎先生的發現，也正是杜撰的別字，這難道還不够使我們那些反對別字的人們覺得爽然若失麼？然而我們究竟要改正這些別字，跟着太炎先生去「乎也夫矣」，還是依舊遷就口語，讓牠「呀唉罷哩」的別下去呢？</p>
<p>如果那勝利是屬於后者，則正字和別字的問題，是不難解决的。因為文字是代表或補充言語的不及的，那末，我們當然要求其遷就口語，使聲口畢肖。一只要「聲口」能够「畢肖」，什麼正字和別一字，是儘可不管的。</p>
<h3>峽中行（中）</h3>
<p>— 方鄔</p>
<p>沿路靑色的江流，不斷地在崖石上碰出雪白的水花，使人的心胸，感到異樣的鬆爽，異樣的淸凉。江上成羣的褐色水鳥，看見有人來了，一陣陣地飛上崖去，沒入蒼綠的樹裳，有時又驀地投了下來，在水上活潑潑地掠過，發出歡喜的呌聲。走路人在這裏還哪會感到抑鬱，儘讓不愉快的疑慮，把腦子盤踞着呢？</p>
<p>在一個山坡轉灣的地方，幾根麻柳樹的下面，緊挨着江邊，躺着一塊大石頭，上面坐着一個穿黑布短衣的漢子，正把雙足仲進江水裏晨面，緩悠悠地洗着——與其說是洗着，到不如說是玩着，神情現得怪開暇的。我的旅伴一看見了他，就停止了口哨子，將手一揚，像報到似的，大聲呌了一下。</p>
<p>「喂。」</p>
<p>等到再叫了一聲之後，那漢子才慢慢地掉過臉來，把右眼謎小，左眼睜大，仔細地望了我們一下，應聲道：</p>
<p>「喔。」</p>
<p>隨即低下頭去，把一隻脚從水襄直了出來，用手懶懶地搓着，好像故意裝着不動聲色的光景。</p>
<p>「就是……一個麼？」</p>
<p>「就是一個。」</p>
<p>「會下雨麼？」</p>
<p>「不會的！」</p>
<p>「那面有風來麼？」</p>
<p>「沒有！」</p>
<p>我的同伴一面同那漢子作着隱語，一面就將背上的包袱，隨使地丢在路邊，並對我點一點頭說：</p>
<p>「你息一息吧！」</p>
<p>那語氣是有些近於命令似的，全不像早上那樣客氣的了。我只得　械地坐下，看見他那　散了的包袱里面，露出一塊土磚的模樣來，我立刻明白我是落入什麼人的手中了。因為我懂得，一般騙人的小賊，要在路上使人不疑惑起見，總是弄些不值　的東西，把包袱裝得大大的。</p>
<p>那位渶子把另一隻足也從水里提出時就往懷里摸出早烟捲來，一枝啣在嘴上，一枝遞給我的旅伴，另一枝遞給我，同時瞇小他的一雙眼睛，現出嘲弄那麼似口吻笑道：</p>
<p>「吃一枝吧，勞你走到這里來，眞是辛苦了你哪！…」</p>
<p>「到不算啥？這全是肚子趕人走路呀！」</p>
<p>我竭力裝着平靜，但還是禁不住心跳起來。</p>
<p>「好說，你老板是為了大銀子哪！」</p>
<p>那漢子嘩然大笑着。</p>
<p>看見我的旅伴在伸出手來拉我身邊的包袱，就用挾着旱烟捲的手對他搖一搖，說道：</p>
<p>「慢一點！」</p>
<p>臉上現出殘酷而帶幾分自娛的樣子，頸上一痕刀疤，現出了紅色。隨即笑嘻嘻地對我從容說道：</p>
<p>「朋友，你懂得嗎？我們並不是不講理的——我得吿訴你……在這個地方的東西，誰有本事拿得着，就是誰的。……那個包袱（用挾烟捲的手指一指包着土磚的包袱）我懷里的烟捲……（接着很自得地抽了一口烟）還有那裏還有一點寳貝（指着坡邊迎春柳下的革叢）都憑你的高典……」</p>
<p>跟着他把一雙眼睛　小了，仰起腦袋，鬼精靈地笑着，烟枝栽在嘴角邊上恰像枝高射砲那麼似的，直描着天空。我還沒有說出什麼話來，我的旅伴就已實行着他的話，把我的包袱奪去打開了，當然他們在這裏是有本事拿我的東西，而歸為自己領有的。</p>
<p>我的旅伴看見包袱裏面沒有值錢的東西，就歪着啣起旱烟管子的嘴吧，不聲不響地，把捲邊的書本，破爛的衣杉，抱來離地兩三尺的光景，然後忽地全拋了下去帶着下細檢查的神色，伸長着他那組燥的鼻子。</p>
<p>那位臉上現得神氣十足的漢子呢，忽地一下子不舒服起來，馬上把烟枝從嘴上摘下，對一我輪大了眼睛，揮一揮手道，但還竭力保持着不動怒的神情。</p>
<p>「朋友，讓我們搜一搜吧！」</p>
<p>等我把解開紐扣的衣衫，重新拉來護着胸口時，這位漢子便把輪大的眼睛，轉向着我那旅伴，（這時他已神色愴惶了）釘了一會兒才用指頭彈一彈烟灰，翹起一隻嘴角懊喪地駡道</p>
<p>「沒帶眼睛麼？你這鄉巴老！……還是捏你的泥巴去。」</p>
<p>我的旅伴氣紅着臉，憤怒地望着我，喃喃地辯護着。。</p>
<p>「噁，…媽的，他還親口說是去辦貨的哪，我…」</p>
<p>那漢于忽然把眼珠子翻了一下，不待他說完，便輕捷地跳在我的背後，一面喊道：</p>
<p>「唔，狡猾的傢伙，你一定藏在革里的。」</p>
<p>一面將我掀開，立即用足探索着我剛才坐過的地方。</p>
<p>我受驚地倒退着，一面囁喘地替自己辯解，同時還帶一點人到臨危時候才發出來的原始的怒氣。</p>
<p>「我有哈子？一個也沒哪，你們要是講理的，就該我那有錢的呀…」</p>
<p>那位漢子看見我實在沒有什麼東西，又聽見我在這麼說，便把剛才暴發出來的怒氣，抑止下去了，只是反問道：</p>
<p>「好，那你為啥子騙他是買貨的呢，吿訴我，為啥子？」</p>
<h3>小學時代的伙伴</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>同伴間隔離過三年，就要「刮目」相看了，何况小學時代的伙伴，分手已有十來年，在十數年的過程中；（人事是經不起那麼一長段時日的遷變的），好些在小學校連坐過一條凳念書的；在一個教室同窗過三年四年的，或在同校一起玩過一二年的，至今那些同伴全在我記憶裏變樣了，並且變得使我那麼吃驚，甚至會不相信這是我從前的同學了。</p>
<p>有一部份舊伙伴，也使我想到像豐子愷先生「小學時代的同學」那張漫畫的感想。</p>
<p>有過一次我在街上瞧到一位從前在一個教室上通課的同學，現在他挑上了糞担，一手裏提着一把糞帚，身子一擺一擺的挑着一担子幌過街去；也有些在本地方開了豆腐店，麺店，餛飩店，他們受社會的薰染，從前念書時的心境至今早丢開，生活毫不放鬆的壓着他們，從十分痛苦專掙扎起來，我一向很同情他們，社會種種惡劣的風尙習氣侵害着那些在生活裏掙扎的伙伴。</p>
<p>我親見到一個遼　滿十六歲的從前會同過校的女同學，嫁給一個地方上的流氓，生下了一大　孩子，她生活裏的痛苦，我不敢去想；前年回鄉來聽說這個女的已經死了。</p>
<p>零外一些舊伙伴，現在已經全有了挺硬的大學文憑；嶄新的洋服在故鄉的街上飄飄然的；明知我記得在小學時一起鬧過架，朝暮一起玩遇，現在已不敢「冒認」那個是我的同學，顯然坐一條板櫈上談不大投機的話了。</p>
<p>他們早不是從前的眼界，也早換過了從前天眞可親的心情，那個還肯回顧頭來看一個賣嘴賣文的窮朋友。</p>
<p>那些過去的伙伴，已跟我活在幾種不同的世界裏了。還有一些已經變成了飽經世故的一副虛偽臉相，他們懂了處世的種種哲學：敷衍，在方便的事件上挨誑，唱高調，做投機，學會了一副油嘴，一見他們我總討厭跟我寒暄天氣，說一套毫無痛癢的假正經話，我只有對　沉默，甘心示弱，對於「副處世哲學，我始終學不像樣的。</p>
<p>我一想起故鄉那些過去的同伴，總會感到異的傷心，寂寞，他們（她們）全跟我活在不同的世界裏，各人走着懸殊的路，各人的思想見地也不會合流，大家用各樣不同的眼光看世界，也許我們將永遠不會走在一起了。</p>
<p>祝福我那些過去舊伙伴們！</p>
<h3>海邊的悲劇（四）</h3>
<p>— 法國巴爾扎克原著王堅生譯</p>
<p>「她的頭髮和一位仙女的一樣。假使你問她，「吿訴我，辟魯突「（那就是我們所稱呼辟銳鐵，她是因聖突辟銳而得各的。柴勃拉梅的名字是辟銳，他是她的教父）——吿訴我，辟魯突」，他繼續着說，「叔叔同你說些什麼呢？」她將這樣回答我：「他沒有和我說什麼。——從來沒有——什麼也沒有說，」「那末，他做了些什麼呢？」總是在星期日那天他吻吻我的前額。」「那麼你不怕麼？」「為什麼得怕」，她說，「他是我的教父呀。」除了我以外，他不願任何別人為他送品食的。」</p>
<p>『辟魯突說，當她來時，他也微笑一下，但是你寗可說這猶如海霧中的日光一閃，因為人家說他是如暴風雨一樣的憂鬰的。」</p>
<p>『但是』我說，「你正是挑起了我們的好奇心，而沒有把牠滿足。你可知道什麼事把他弄到這個地步？是深憂呢還是懺悔？還是瘋狂？還是罪惡？是他……</p>
<p>「啊，先生，除了我和我的父親外任何人也不明白這事的底蘊。我的母親，她現在是已經死了，她生前是一位裁判官家裏的女僕，柴勃拉梅曾吿訴這位裁判官全部的故事。港　的人們說代他懺悔的修道士，對他們的　悔，只允給他贖罪證。我的可憐的母親，因為裁判官的客堂就在廚房的隔壁，無意中竊聽柴勃拉梅的講話。她在過去聽見了這件事，她現在是死了，裁判官也聽見這件事，他現在也死了，我的母親曾再三叮嚀我們——我和父親——决不要向這兒的居民洩露這件事，但是我可以這樣的吿訴你，我的母親吿訴我們的那天晚上，我眞有些毛骨聳然。」</p>
<p>「那末，把這段故事吿訴我們罷，我的好友！我們决不向任何人提起的。」</p>
<p>這位漁人望着我們，這樣繼續着吿訴我們說：「辟銳柴勃拉梅，你們在那兒看見的一位，是柴勃拉梅家族中的最長的一個。他們父子做航海家，已經幾代。從他們的姓名看來，就可以知道海是常常在他們控制之下的。你們看見的那位，是一個漁人，他有自己的技藝，他有許多小船，他常常划船去捕沙定魚。甚至於替漁販們捕深海中魚。個使他不十分愛戀他的妻子的話，他將定造一隻船專去捕鰲魚。妻子過去是一位美麗的婦人，從居輪第地方來的勃蘭族人，——過去她是很光榮的——並且頗其慈心。她是非常愛着她的丈夫，因此她决不允許他離開得比捕沙定魚還要長久的期間，停在那兄！他們就居住在那邊——那邊』這位漁夫說後，為欲指出述離海邊夾在沙丘與居輪第的沼澤的小島，走上一座小岡。『你看見那所房子麼？那就是他的屋子。呷克葵突勃蘭和柴勃拉梅僅有一個孩子，一個男孩子。他們很愛他的，——愛到怎樣程度呢？——夫人！總之像一個獨養子一　。他們愛之若狂，假使他們的小呷克葵斯隨意　和些什麼束西在他們的羹湯中，原諒我罷，失人，他們一定說這更使牠好吃些·我們看見他倆在市塲中替孩子買最精美的玩具。眞不知多少次啊！每個人都告訴他們，這是一件蠢事·小柴勃拉梅不久就明白他自己可以隨所欲為，於是長大成人的時候，他就無惡不作。假使任何人走到他的父親面前，說：「你的兒子幾乎把某某人的小孩置於死地啊！　他只是在笑着說：「啊！　將來定然是一位成功的海員，他總有一天可以指揮皇上的軍艦的·」或者另外一人說：「　銳柴勃拉梅，你可知道你的兒子已經把　名突的小女孩弄瞎了眼嗎？」「這裏將有一位對付女孩子的男童，」辟銳這樣說，這孩子在父親的心目中，　　　點瑕疵也沒有，於是在他十歲的時候，這位年輕的小獸將搏擊每一個遇見他的人；他曾為了游戲扭過鷄頸。剖開豬腹。我敢說他眞像貓般的沉溺於血泊中呢！「他將成為一個光榮的兵士」柴勃拉梅說：「他己經有點嗜殺的習氣了呢。」</p>
<h3>孤獨</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>當沉默的時候，一種孤獨之喊便向心頭襲擊過來，緊緊地扯住我的心。我便望到眼前任何一件東西，孩子似地獨個兒笑起來，但笑得都堅輕，我自己都沒有聽見。我自然也不缺少和人們接觸和熱鬧的機會，只是在獨個見沉默着的時候，那些做作的模樣哄人的話，虛偽的笑，一一在我的眼前晃着，我努力想避掉牠們也不成，牠們總是頑固地沉浮在眼前，這樣，那孤獨之感便來襲擊我了。我果然明白這是很平凡的事情，不必那麼孩子氣地去重看牠。有許多人在欺騙和做作中間得到了溫飽，有許多人在欺騙和械作中間得到了安慰。人是藏起了靈魂的一隅而生活着的。因此就沒有一個人不是孤獨的了。</p>
<p>我每次孩子般地一個人苦痛着，在暗地裏責備別人不應該那麼哄我，那麼虛偽地對我時，便獨個兒禁不住微微地笑起來。這顯然是給自己安慰的笑，可是那笑臉還沒有收斂時，仍舊二覺得自己是孤獨的，我的一顆心苦痛着。我聽人家給我說許多安慰的話，鼓勵的話，給我許多親切的笑，那些笑語還縈繫在我耳際的時候，各人的靈魂已離得那麼遠，行為也離得那麼遠了。</p>
<p>人便是這麼孤獨地生活下來的。</p>

<h3>神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>發生本症之原因，大率由於身體過勞，精神作業過甚，吸煙，嗜酒，遺精，手淫，淋病及淫慾遠度等所致。</p>
<p>本症有腦髓性神經衰弱及脊髓性神經衰弱之別，在腦髓性神經衰弱者，其症狀恒為頭痛，頭重，眼花耳鳴，失眠健忘，情感劇變，食慾缺損，對於精神事業，亦無力操作，脊髓性神經衰弱症者，其習見之症狀則為晨起即覺身體疲倦，步行時下體筋肉易覺疲勞，下肢時有異常之感，最顯著者荐骨部常訴疼痛。此外有早洩，陰萎者，此皆性神經衰弱之徵也。</p>
<p>治療本症，除患者自身須力除致病之誘因外，對於生活環境之攝生，亦甚屬重要，如——姑擇最便利實行者數種，作業與休息須求適度，運動得法，確定飲食時間，避去不規則之生活，正思慮，絕慾急，慎交游，選擇適當之營養品，務使身心得到寗靜與自由。治療本症之藥物，盡人皆知燐為主要品之一，蓋燐為補神之要藥也，人體消耗燐質過多，自當求相當之補充不可，市上所售補神經系之燐製劑多矣，然我臨床所賞用者厥惟安爾神，因該藥含有特強之燐質而無任何流弊，使衰弱神經易於恢復正常也，現時甚囂塵上之蛋黃素，即卵黃燐脂，咸知其可以用於戒烟，然不知對於斯症反較戒煙奏效顯著多矣，如現顯著的性神經衰弱時，則內分泌荷爾蒙製劑為不可或缺之補助，本症舍藥物治療外，電械療法亦有相當之價值，但在就醫時患者自己之治療，亦為不可或少之事，務須擯去俗務，使身心得到絕對之自由，則雖若何重症，亦不難恢復常態。（編者按：馮善樑先生對於神經系疾患，研究有素，譽為專家，其所藥用之安爾神，係治神經衰弱之專劑，經售處本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老徳行里一號仁壽西藥社，每瓶一元五角，郵寄加一。）</p>
<h3>神經性胃痛</h3>
<p>— 佘雷醫師</p>
<p>胃酸過多慢性持續性胃液漏及定期性持續性胃液漏等均足以引起胃分泌神經異常之症。因而致發胃痛。但致發神經性胃痛原因殊多。並非僅祗上述已也。如胃運動神經及知覺神經異常時。亦恒發本症。茲篇所述。僅就胃酸過多而言。胃酸過多者。即胃內容之酸度。較多於普通之謂。有時器質變化之胃病。亦足發本症。茲略不述。發生本症之原因。大率因慢性腸病。膽汁分泌障碍。生殖器障碍。煙酒過度。多食香煙。持久進刺戟品而起。此外亦有因精神過勞。憂鬱等。亦為本病之誘因。患者常覺胃部不快。壓重胃痛。胃痛都發於食後二三小時。此外尚有吞酸。嘈雜。酸恃噯氣等。投以亞爾加里劑。立即緩解。為本病之特徵。在本症之食餌療法上厥惟脂肪類。脂肪既能減退酸度。對虛弱病人又為最有效之營養品。脂肪性食物中。尤以牛乳為最。其他凡足以刺戟胃粘膜及旺盛泌酸力之食物。均在禁止之例。在器械療法上。洗胃法頗有效。食鹽水。重曹水均可。重症則用硝酸銀水。須於侵晨空腹時行之。電械方面厥惟短波透熱電。藥物療治。其能使分泌如常。且中和過多之酸以達止痛之目的者。厥惟亞爾加里劑。而亞爾加里劑中比較完美而無所妨害者。厥惟馬訪翁醫師所賞用之胃寶。該製品既不含有毒性止痛劑。而又能得收效於片時。誠理想中之胃痛藥也。或謂用鴉片可使止痛且減少酸度。然不知初雖減少。迨後反使酸度增加。不及莨菪多矣。關於此只要看患胃病而吸煙上癮者。仍在時發胃病。可以明矣。（編者按：胃寶每盒二元。為治胃痛之特製劑。馬訪翁先生用之有素。無待贅言。其經售處上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社。佘雷醫師為內科胃腸病專家。對於鴉片與人體之影響。尤研究有素。聲望久著。戒者盈門。有戒煙聖手之譽。）</p>
<h3>急性淋疾</h3>
<p>— 崔馥卿醫師</p>
<p>感染淋疾。約在二日以上五日以下之潛伏期。發現初症。間亦略有遲早者。初症既發。尿道口。舟狀窩部及緊帶龜頭諸處。其知覺俱稍稍異常。時發微癢。龜頭則覺溫暖。又如蟻行。陰莖覺重而緊張。舟狀窩及會陰部或發刺痛。精系睾丸或牽引而作鈍痛。尿道內之發炎。不足以誘發春興。故陰莖往往勃起。兼之洩溺頻數。每小便時。亦自覺溫於平日。便後其痛更甚。如此約二至四日。尿道外口唇逐遽腫起。因之發一種光澤。尿道口粘膜發紅。繼以乳嘴隆起。此時以拇指與食指擠尿道口上下。則見粘滑之液少許洩出。若小便經時無有。該粘滑液即膠粘尿道口之兩唇而封閉。至小便時。前覺發熱者。今則灼熱矣。試驗其尿。則見雜有似絲如雪之物。此皆上皮粘液與膿球之混合物也。既而炎症愈劇。尿道粘膜腫脹。分泌亦愈甚。龜頭根部及舟狀窩。均發壓痛。尿意頻數。每溺必灼熱疼痛。尿道口洩出多量之膿液。治療本症時除須絕對安靜。禁進刺戟性食物外。對於藥物療法。外用通常用銀製劑殺菌液。但現今所推獎者厥惟淋毒舒藥耳內服以美靈洋行之滅殺淋為佳。注射劑色素中以安的雪清及脫呂怕弗拉文為上。伐克辛中以混合漿苗為優。直空管短波電療機及最新療濁機對急性淋更收奇效。（編者按淋毒舒藥耳及滅殺淋二藥均歸上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社獨家經售。滅殺淋每盒一元淋毒藥舒耳藥罐二元五角。郵購寄費加一。）</p>
<h3>濕疹</h3>

<p>濕疹乃一種炎症性皮膚病。為瘙癢性皮膚炎症。患處皮膚潮紅腫脹。其上更有小水泡。丘疹。或膿庖等發生。此種濕疹或散在。或成團。皮膚表面往往濕潤結痂。至後麟屑脫落而漸趨治愈。設遷延不治。則皮膚起浸潤肥厚而成慢性。奧司比氏謂濕疹猶如皮膚之表在性加答兒之疾患也。發生本病之原因。有二種。（一）外因，如化學的溫熱的器械的刺戟。（二）內因。如腺病慢性胃腸病及神經系統之疾患。月經異常。糖尿病。腎臟病。肝臟病及貧血病衰弱者。皆有續發本病之虞。本症自發生至全治。因其發現之狀態可分六期。一紅斑期。皮膚呈紅色而腫起。二丘疹期。皮膚因細包之浸潤。而發生丘疹有癢感。三水泡期。此時皮膚有細胞浸潤之外。又有血漿之滲出。滲出後在角質層下停留。形成水泡。其內容為水樣透明之液。四膿庖期。因水庖內混有膿球。故內容溷濁。五濕潤期或結痂期。此際水泡或膿庖因受手指搔抓或衣服摩擦之刺戟。泡膜破潰。膿液流出。而結成痂皮。六麟屑期。此為濕疹全愈之時也。本症外用藥中以滅絕菌MISULZINE為最佳。蓋其能深達皮膚層而奏宏偉之殺菌力。此藥既不污衣服。且氣味芬芳。誠理想中之皮膚聖藥。經售處上海法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社。每盒一元郵寄加一。皮膚病專家醫師吳繩先生臨證賞用此藥。可知其價值。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>籌辦勞工保險</h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>南京十一日專電云：「實部籌辦勞工保險，已擬就勞工保險法草案，呈請行政院通過，送中政會核議，下月初可送立法院審議。該法原則以保障勞工生活為主旨，採取強制主義，保險類分傷害保險與疾病保險兩種」。</p>
<p>無疑，在生活毫無保障的中國勞工看來，這是值得欣喜的設施。勞工在社會上是現代人民福利主要的創造者，財富的生產，他們的生活在人民中却常常是悲慘命運的遭遇者。因此在十九世紀中經過許多學者的倡議，與勞工自身的奮鬥，目前差不多多數的文明國家，都有了勞動社會保險的締訂。而且有不少的國家，業已採入憲法，成為政府施政的主要部份。</p>
<p>一般實業家，唯一所注意的是利潤的獲取，從來很少留心勞動條件改善，安全設施等，各國勞工因此等事件而發生衝突的，實難以數計。但一談到中國的實業，原屬言之可慘，實業的本身，既不發達，又怎當得各國資本家的榨取，是以一般實業家，欲獲得自己的利潤，已極困難，更談不到對於工人疾病時救濟。今得由勞工保險而加以保障，任隨如何總可算是功德無量，造福民生。</p>
<p>不過「勞工保險」其主要形式雖採取國家的「強制主義」，得以因勢就利，而它的終極目的，却在於促成社會上改善勞動環境，注意安全設施，與乎建立嚴正的勞工衛生的設備。因此我們除了法令施行之外，還須推動整個社會。才能使勞工得到「保險」的幸福。</p>
<p>尤有進者，勞工保險不僅在注意傷害，與疾病，還須及於文化設施失業救濟撫卹養老各部門。或者有人認為前二者是目前中國的切要，須得循次漸進，那我們就拭目以觀其後罷。</p>
<h3>迎秋曲</h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>從瀰漫在灰色天宇間的斜風細雨上，從每陣疲憊的蟬吟上，從每天要褪一點顏色的太陽光上，夏是悄悄地消逝了，敞着襟，坐在窗口遙睇那鋪展在眼底的縱橫的街市，心裹便湧起了「一年容易又秋風」的感覺。一夏的喧囂與擾攘都平靜下來，讓風雨來結束那曾經耀着光輝與榮華的一切。這正如去參加一個淒涼的葬禮，見到的只有凋悴的花圈與默默然移動着的穿着黑袍的僧侶行列，聽到的只有悼泣般的音樂曲子，在心底也不由得不抹上一兩筆灰暗的油彩。</p>
<p>還記得去年初秋的時候，新雨後露出幾片晴光，白雲在天宇堆成奇異的峯彩，趁着興，向郊外去尋那和秋天情調相配合的西班牙建築，廣闊田　間，這邊是一塊未褪色的殘綠，那邊是玩具般的緋紅色別墅房子：偶爾在靜僻的林蔭路上，可以看到踽踽獨行的哀愁的少婦，撐了小陽傘，夢一般地飄過，心裹便半帶着惆悵去看那迷失於秋林間的背影。但如今，連這點心情都沒有了，屋子是靜的，人是瘦的，口裹噴出的烟圈是慘白的，心緒是淡的。什麽都不想，只想到鄉間去看那一清見底的秋潭，和鵝羽般飄洒的蘆花。</p>
<p>在這裹，除了聽到幾聲賣冰的叫喝以外，秋的痕跡是比較少的，若在鄉間，情形更不同了。田野間都起伏着豐饒的麥浪，斜陽照上牛背，耀出一片刺目的金色。小河如殼紋般流逝過去，炊烟在青銅色的天宇上流幻成為符咒的文字。有樹葉私語聲，有雨點打上草木聲，有無力的蕩槳聲，有星空下雜蟲的鼓翼聲；村野的和平，心的醇凈，季節的美，在那裹譜出一隻無言的曲章。而我呢，將坐在一株老樹下面，抽着和平的烟管，對向晚的如畫的田野作一回盡情的凝視。沒人理會我，除了隨熟的鵝犬以外。</p>
<p>但這企望是難得實現的，沒事的時候，也曾帶着一本沒用的書，帶着公園票，帶着自己永不能改去的沉默脾氣，勾留在秋的公園裹；詩意的池沼上翱翔着一種倦怠的氣氛，法國梧桐在夏末的微　中打顫，鳥雀在喙食新雨後的泥土，我聞到秋的呼吸了。猩紅色的斜陽影裹，坐在長椅上看天半白雲的徵逐，看被夕照染紅了的游人的臉，看樹枝搖曳，看別人吃剩的拋在地上的香蕉皮，看手頭的書和無意中在書中發現的舊電車票，全是美的。天氣已經不熱了，但也不過涼，在孤獨的恬逸中，我仿彿聽到秋天對我的召喚，幻想便像錦綢般地展開了，我想像秋天該有很好的花，有螢火蟲織成的美夢，有蟋蟀慰我的寂寞，有甜的炒栗，有圓大的成熟的葡萄，有明潔的引起人幻想的天空，有去掉枷鎖般的混身的鬆快，這一切的點綴，就把整個季節的灰暗情調趕了個乾淨。我期待着一點點蕭爽的風雨，看秋的魔手把宇宙改成怎樣，我要看看秋的力量。</p>
<p>我的期待是沒落空的，從那瀰漫在灰色天宇間的斜風細雨上，從每陣疲憊的蟬吟上，從每天褪一點顏色的太陽光上，秋已經悄悄地來了。</p>
<h3>蟬</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>晚上坐在樹蔭底下看書，常常不自覺的想起黃仲則的一句詩：「蟬到吞聲尚有聲」。其實並不是無因的，一來，返鄉後我便天天聽着那為人十分討厭而為我十分感到興趣的蟬聲，二來，那句詩實說出了年來自家的行將「入中年」的心情。</p>
<p>的確，我對蟬是感到特別的興趣的。幼時，因為生長在鄉村，於是每到夏天，蟬便作了我的終日的好伴侶。在烈日底下，捏着盧頭成天的找尋蜘蛛網，等到盧頭上的蜘蛛絲纏得很多很多了，便抬着頭在大樹上找蟬，每次總要膠住許多蟬關在籠子裹。蟬剛剛關進籠子時，只想飛，老是從這邊撞到那邊，從那邊撞到這邊，久之，也便安分了。掛在樑上或床架上也會很自然的叫起來了。在當時，我當然極度歡喜，但爸媽常把我的籠子摔到門外去，我恨着，我找不到把籠子摔到門外去的理由。</p>
<p>因為知道，蟬是吃露的，所以一到晚上便把籠子掛到外邊去。這樣，常常許多天，許多天，蟬還是活，還是趾高氣揚地叫着。玩得厭了，把籠子一開，捉一二隻起來，讓牠飛到遠方去。或是用一條綫子兩端都牽了一隻蟬，讓牠飛，一扯一牽，飛起來是十分困難的，但就爲了這，我感到十分滿意。不特如此，我還高興用一種什麽草的殼子戴上了蟬的眼睛，讓牠飛，牠飛得極高極高，有時遇到風把牠眼睛上的殼子吹去了，牠便得救似的飛到綠樹林中去，假設殼子永久戴在眼睛上，牠便永久向上飛，向上飛，有時却突然跌下，大概太疲憊，或是暈眩的緣故。</p>
<p>爸媽告訴我，假設這樣做，來生要做瞎子的，但事實上並不因此害怕，實在，這玩法太使我感到興味了。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>在蟬未脫殼以前，現在纔知道叫復育」，當初我只曉得叫「知了　」。每在梅雨後，「復育」掀開了泥，出一個小洞，準備爬到樹上脫殼。因為那時還是初夏，蟬還沒有叫，所以特別寳貴　復育」。被困在屋子裏，只盼望梅雨有片刻的停止。停止時便跣足去找尋小洞口，像哥倫布發現飄流在海面上的樹技似的對每一個小洞口都小心地用手指探進去。得到後關在籠子裏等牠脫殼，但總不及用蛛蜘絲膠來的好。有時剛脫去了半雙殼，我便不耐煩了，用手指把再有半雙　起來，給果翅子總是長得不好。最好在月明之夜悄悄地摸到每一棵樹上去，因為，那時常常有「復育」正在脫殼，或已經脫殼了，新蟬翅子剛剛長好，顏色是淡湖色的，比諸叫的那些黑翅的蟬特別來得漂亮。</p>
<p>除此以外，還高興找蟬殼，據說可以入藥，可以賣給附近鎭上的藥店裏去。拿出去賣雖不曾，但每當夏季總要聚到數百雙，用綫穿成一長串，掛在帳子竹上雖不及珍珠那樣貴，但有珍珠那樣的美麗。</p>
<p>然而這些夢我已讓給了下一輩的孩子們。在晚上，在淸風徐來的黃昏，我已無心和孩子們猜那隻熟爛的謎語：「住末住勒泥裏，爬末爬勒高楊，日裏末吹笛勒白相，夜來末吃酒勒乘凉」。聽到蟬聲，我只不自覺的想起黃仲則的一句詩：「蟬到吞聲尙有聲」。</p>
<h3>醫院裏</h3>
<p>— 戈人</p>
<p>當我醒來的時候，屋內巴經漆黑一團了。於是我翻手到背後想去扭電炬的開關，但是手指所觸到的地方是泳冷一片的堅硬的牆壁，而且我的臥床好像也更換了一個似的：這使我疑惑我在做夢了。想喊一聲罷，如果眞的在做夢，也可以突然地醒來，否則更能證明我的懷疑是否是多慮。但是遍體像軟索子困着似的不能張動還在其次，喉頭的直被啫塞着，要喊出一聲來是萬萬做不到的事。這樣我睜若眼睛，望着漆黑的空間，竭力使自家安靜着，我想總能有一點什麼動靜來證實我現在的懷疑。</p>
<p>但是腦子這樣東西總是不能由自家主宰的：有時候牠像平靜的海面一樣，有時候竟翻江倒海起來，現在就在這樣的情况之下，我的腦海裏像一團抽不出頭緒來的亂麻，想起這，想起那，許多遺忘的慘痛明晰地演映起來，一點亦不留情，使我被軟索子什麼困着的身體痛苦地抽搐着，喉頭再不能受那種啫塞的壓逼了：好像有一股氣從胸腦間湧上來，牠打破了那個難關，原來是一聲咳嗽。這樣一來，我完全想過來了：今天早上起來的時候，有些發燥，免强想上寫字間去，彷彿是想擠上一輛擁塞着乘客的電車吧，擠着，撞着的時候，自家的兩條腿軟化了，以後或許是昏過去的。那末，我用手再去撫摸一下號冰冷一片的堅硬的墻壁，摸着床沿摸着自家的額角，額角是像火一般地炙着，無疑地是我昏倒過去後被搬到一個什麼地方來了，腦海裏翻騰了這末許多想頭之後，安靜下來了；其實兩太陽穴裏己感到隠隱作痛，牠再也不能想一點什麼了。但是旣已證實了不是做夢，倒底是睡在什麼地方呢？這第二個疑問我還是想曉得的。我旣不能動彈我的身體，我的手還能免强做一點工作的，我鼓足一股力，敲着那冰冷的牆壁。果然在我的耳畔送來了一陣閣閣的皮鞋聲，牠停心的時俟，室內的電燈亮了。「在醫院裏」，我馬上明白了，那個穿着白衣，戴着白帽的小姐用一種憫憐的熊度向我搖搖頭，一只熱度表，我看得分明的，擱到我的舌根底下。我就閉上了眼晴，因為我想起我的辦公室裏不見了我這樣一個人後不知有無變動，這在我是個最大的問題。</p>
<p>看護小姐看過熱度表，他吿訴我熱度己經减低，好好地安靜着，就會好起來的。我想等着她再告訴我些什麼，可是她旋轉身子要走了。那時候，我粗野地叫起來了。「倒底是誰送到我醫院裏來的？」她先禁止我大聲說話，於是她講着故事似的對我說了：你是早上有幾個人送來的，他們說你昏到在電車站上，經我們醫生診過之後，在你口袋裏發現了你工作的地方，打電話去他們回答是他們的職員，可是，她注視了我半嚮：</p>
<p>「他們說你是個獨身者啊！」</p>
<p>她彷彿不信任似的等着我問答，對於一個不相識者的誠意使我興奮起來，我想告訴她剛才腦海裏翻騰起來的故事，或許她能對我表示一點同情之感吧！但是我向她點了點頭，報了她一個微笑，把眼睛盍上了，讓這個故事永遠保存在我的腦海中罷。</p>

Initially, it was proposed to designate Xinpu as the urban area, but Donghai County would be significantly affected, so the discussion was postponed. The scope has now been determined by the provincial government and will be temporarily bounded by Linhongkou to the south, Shaoxiang River to the north, the eastern coast, including the East and West Lian Islands, and the western coast, including the areas east of the Linhong River, Xinpu, and Banpu, to be widely publicized.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>What Are the Reasons Company Stocks Cannot Circulate?</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>A few days ago, this newspaper's current affairs commentary discussed the problem of industrial and commercial enterprises absorbing capital. It stated that our country's company stocks have no public market prices or circulation mechanisms. Those seeking them find it difficult to find them, and those selling them find it difficult to sell them, making them securities that cannot circulate. This is indeed the current situation of most company stocks in our country. However, what are the reasons for this? Please allow us to conduct a historical review of this point.</p>
<p>The beginning of the securities industry in our country was initially promoted under the name of "joint-stock companies." During the early stages of the European War, Chinese industry flourished for a time, and stock trading was quite prosperous. At that time, company stocks such as the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao Company, Dasheng Yarn Factory, Commercial Press, and Hanyeping Company were very active in the market. The lively state remains deeply imprinted on our minds. Government bond trading, on the other hand, was limited by the limited number of issues and only occupied a secondary position. However, before long, the European War ended. The once-prosperous industries mostly suffered a severe setback. As a result, the foundation of the stock market was almost completely destroyed. Government bond trading then took its place and monopolized the market. When the stock market crash occurred, investors, deceived by the lure of high profits, eagerly tried to encompass all to meet them, but unexpectedly suffered a crushing defeat and their funds were thrown into a bottomless pit. General investors had to become somewhat cautious as a result.</p>
<p>The disappearance of company stocks from the market was indeed due to the times and the environment. However, the loss of credit due to the poor management of some companies was also an important reason. In the past, when the China National Sugar Manufacturing Company was established, the founders issued a rallying cry, and investors were very enthusiastic. Even people from the inland areas came to Shanghai, often traveling extra distances, to request to buy shares, hoping that the people's interest in investment would gradually be aroused. Unexpectedly, due to poor planning in advance and the failure of the organizers, it fell into an irreparable state before it even officially started construction. Although various plans have been made over the past ten years, there has been no way to revive it. As for those who were once known for their excellent business performance, but suffered irreparable losses due to the organizers not following the usual practices and expanding excessively, there are many examples. These failures in industry and commerce are enough to affect the credit of all corporate enterprises. This is why company stocks in our country are not easily circulated today.</p>
<p>Moreover, in recent years, due to the general enthusiasm of businessmen for speculation, the securities market has relied on the futures trading of government bonds as its lifeline. Spot trading is just a formality and insignificant. Stock trading is even more disregarded. We previously heard that people outside the industry were forming another stock exchange, but because stocks were hastily put up for auction, there were many types of spot trading, and few transactions. Before half a month had passed, it had returned to being an exchange with prices but no market. The numerous names of company stocks and the different content of each company mean that not only do the general public lack a deep understanding of them, but even securities practitioners probably lack the knowledge to study them. There are also no such reference publications available. Investors have no way to ask for information. How can investment interest be aroused?</p>
<p>If we want company stocks to become active in the market again in the future, we should start by reducing the speculative mentality of general businessmen and establishing the social credit of those engaged in real industry.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Journalist Delegation Continues to Petition Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The petition delegation of newspaper reporters from various counties in Jiangsu Province gathered at the Central Hotel at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 14th. They set off at 7:30 AM and went to the Central Political Council to petition. It was during a meeting, so Ye Chucang, a member of the Standing Committee, received them. The representatives presented their petition. Ye said that all of it would be accepted, and that the case had been handed over to the Legislative Group of the council for review, which would be instructed to send the principle back to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The representatives asked how much the amendments could be. Ye replied that since amendments were being prepared, they would be amended thoroughly. He said that the opinions put forward by the press from various places could be amended separately. He said that he had been a newspaper reporter before, and would not forget the sufferings of reporters just because he was no longer a reporter. The representatives expressed their satisfaction. They then asked Ye to preside over the matter from beginning to end. Ye replied that he was willing to be a representative for everyone, hoping to satisfy everyone. The representatives expressed their satisfaction. They then went to the Judicial Yuan to petition, asking for an interpretation of the criminal law on publication, and the issue of multiple penalties for reporters' errors. Secretary Xie Guansheng received them and promised to forward the representatives' opinions to President Ju. The representatives returned to their residences at 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, at 2:30 PM, the delegation again sent representatives and, together with the Capital Journalism Society and reporters stationed in Beijing from Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan, formed three groups, carrying a joint petition statement signed by the three expanded petition groups. The three groups set off for the Legislative Group of the Central Political Council and the Central Committee members in Beijing to conduct an expanded petition. The first group, consisting of Cheng Qi, Zhao Ying, Shen Jiuxiang, Sun Dexian, and Hu Juemin, visited Chen Gongbo, Ma Chaojun, and Jiao Yitang, but none of them were present. They left the statement of the three groups. The second group, consisting of Zhao Minheng, Liao Shouchang, and Bao Mingshu, visited Shao Yuanchong, Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, Luo Jialun, Ye Li, and Luo, but none of them were present. They met Shao Yuanchong, who expressed sympathy for the opinions put forward by the reporters and promised to do his best to mediate when the Legislative Group of the Central Political Council held a meeting to review them. The third group, consisting of Chen Mingde, Sun Zhaokai, Cao Dazong, and Wang Shenwu, visited Wang Shijie, Gu Zhenggang, Qin Zhen, and Deng Feihuang. Qin Dengmin was out and not present. Wang said that he accepted all the statements submitted by the three groups and promised to bring them up for discussion at the Legislative Group meeting. Gu said that public opinion was the spirit of the people, and at a time when the people's morale was declining, the government should especially enhance the authority of public opinion and promote the people's morale. The press should also cooperate effectively with the government. He believed that the amendments requested by the press were very legitimate and was willing to support them. Finally, Gu added that the Legislative Group of the Central Political Council had recently exchanged views and believed that the amendments to the publication law this time were excessive and did not conform to the principles previously set by the Legislative Group. It was necessary to re-establish the principles and send them back to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. His words were very sincere and moved the representatives. They returned in the evening. Also, the Jiangsu county petition delegation decided to form the Jiangsu Journalism Society. In addition to the three counties of Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Wuxian, which were originally assigned to be responsible for the preparation, six additional counties, Wujin, Jiangyin, Changshu, Yixing, Jiangdu, and Nantong, were added to participate in the preparation. Also, the three counties of Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Wuxian were elected as standing committee members of the preparatory committee. The location of the preparatory committee was temporarily set in Wuxi.

<h3>Ministry of Interior Explains Ambiguities in the Law on Punishment of Violations of Public Order</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Fujian Provincial Government stated that the Law on Punishment of Violations of Public Order stipulates that if a hotel knows that a guest is about to commit a serious crime under criminal law and does not secretly report it to the public security bureau, it should be punished. Now that the new criminal law has been implemented on July 1, there is no such provision, and there is no doubt about its applicability. The Ministry of Interior explained that since Article 33, Section 4 of the Law on Punishment of Violations of Public Order is based on Article 162 of the old criminal law, although the new criminal law has deleted that article, it should still be punished according to the crime level standards stipulated in the old criminal law before the Law on Punishment of Violations of Public Order is amended. As for those who have violated the crime stipulated in Article 162 of the old criminal law, although it does not constitute a crime under the new criminal law, it should still be punished for violating public order because it has a great impact on social order, in order to maintain public security.

<h3>Western End of the Aleutian Islands Designated as a Defense Zone by the United States, A Preliminary Step in Building an Air Force Base in the Pacific</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt yesterday ordered the designation of the western end of the Aleutian Islands as a defense zone for the army and navy. Observers here believe that this move is a preliminary step in establishing an air force base in the Pacific. US naval officers have wanted to establish an air force base in the Aleutian Islands for more than a decade. The implementation of this plan would allow long-range aircraft to operate in coordination with the navy. At the same time, naval officers also have plans for aviation facilities in Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam. It is said that after the United States abandons the Philippines, it can set up a naval base in Guam because this place has a strategic port that is easy to defend and difficult to attack. Also, according to observers, although existing treaties do not allow the establishment of defensive projects in the Aleutian Islands, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam, preparatory work such as harbor facilities, radio stations, etc., can be carried out.

<h3>To Save the East African War, Eden Arrives in Paris with a Plan, The Tripartite British, French, and Italian Conference Opens Today, Seeking a Solution from an Economic Perspective</h3>
<p>(Paris) The tripartite conference on Abyssinia will open tomorrow with an eagerness that is not marred by undue pessimism or optimism, according to a person in charge who spoke to a Reuters reporter. However, the opinion of one group of people is mostly pessimistic, and it is widely felt that Britain holds the key to solving this problem. However, no one but Eden now knows what proposals Britain will have. Eden arrived here last night. Many news reporters were waiting for him. Eden did not make a statement and drove to the British Embassy.</p>
<p>According to Reuters from London, Britain will pay close attention to the tripartite talks. British public opinion generally knows the far-reaching consequences that the Italian-Abyssinian war will cause. Britain now believes that although the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is difficult and has reached a critical stage, there is still a way to solve it if it can return to a point of calm and reasonable research. It is hoped that the tripartite talks will achieve this goal. The British government has thoroughly studied all aspects of the overall situation in the past few weeks, and the economic aspect has also been involved. Therefore, Eden will be able to put forward constructive suggestions for the representatives to discuss. This suggestion will not apply pressure to either side of the dispute and will be of great benefit to the work of agreeing on a plan that can be accepted by both sides. At present, there are two possible courses of action, peace or war. If a peaceful resolution is not sought, then force will inevitably be resorted to, regardless of the repeated treaty obligations, and the instability in Europe will be even worse. The value of all international contracts will then be questioned, and this point alone will be enough to cause a reaction from various races in remote areas, which will be irreparable. It is expected that the tripartite conference will be chaired by French Prime Minister Laval, and the Italian representative will be Baron Aloisi. The results of the conference will be reported to the League of Nations Executive Council meeting on September 4. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Talks Begin: Eden States British Viewpoint; Offers Economic Interests, Opposes Political Cessions</h3>
<p>(Paris) The British and French delegations held their first talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 this morning to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian issue, concluding at 12:15. The British side was represented by Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden, British Ambassador to France Sir Eric Phipps, and Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Robert Vansittart. The French side was represented by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierre Laval, Director of Political Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Berthelot, and Principal Private Secretary, Mr. Rochat. Laval then issued a statement to the press, saying that he would meet with Italian representative Aloisi tomorrow, and a formal meeting with Eden and Aloisi would be held on Friday. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to information obtained by a Havas diplomatic correspondent, when British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden held talks with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierre Laval this morning, Eden only stated the British view on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute to Laval. The British government advocates establishing an agreement on Abyssinia based on the Tripartite Treaty of 1906 regarding Abyssinia and the exchange of notes between Great Britain and Italy on December 20, 1925. The exchange of notes between Great Britain and Italy on December 20, 1925, allowed all countries with connections to Abyssinia to obtain equal opportunities for economic development, but political preferences should be rejected. The official also said that Italy should be allowed to have a large sphere of influence in Abyssinia to engage in economic development, but the areas along Lake Tana and the upper reaches of the Nile River and its tributaries should be reserved as a sphere of British interest. The principles stipulated in this declaration could have led to the conclusion of a treaty, but the Abyssinian government did not agree to the draft treaty, so it was abandoned. Currently, Britain does not want to obtain any new interests in Abyssinia and is prepared to support Italy's economic demands, but Britain opposes political concessions, because Abyssinia is an independent country and a member of the League of Nations. If its territorial integrity is once destroyed, it will inevitably endanger the collective security system based on the League of Nations. As for Laval, he strongly advocated that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute must be resolved peacefully, otherwise it may inevitably lead to serious international consequences. The content of today's Anglo-French talks is roughly like this. After the Italian representative Aloisi arrives in Paris tomorrow, he can present the main viewpoints of the Italian government to Laval. The formal negotiations will not begin until the three countries hold a meeting on Friday. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Sir Anthony Eden arrived here last night and will hold preliminary talks with Foreign Minister Laval this morning. Le Matin hopes that the talks between the two can clarify whether Britain is prepared to concede economic interests to Italy to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, or still refuses to consider a political solution to Italy's demands. Le Journal says that the British suggestion of redistributing colonies is impossible, but it is hoped that a constructive plan can be put forward, allowing Italy to obtain some economic interests in Abyssinia. However, the newspaper is ambiguous about whether Italy is willing to accept this solution, because Italy has repeatedly stated that political and military control of Abyssinia is necessary. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A London dispatch says that Sir Anthony Eden will bring an important plan to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, which has attracted attention here. Eden is expected to arrive here tonight, and political circles here are eagerly awaiting him. It is widely rumored that Eden will advocate the redistribution of colonies to save the Italian-Abyssinian war. Le Journal states that Britain must bear the cost of this proposal and cede a part of British Somaliland to Abyssinia. Le Quotidien says that this proposal should not be taken seriously, because this proposal may not be more advanced than the one Eden recently proposed to Mussolini in Rome. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The tripartite Anglo-French-Italian conference to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is about to be held. According to what Le Matin's correspondent in London knows, the British delegation has been ordered to seek an economic solution that can be accepted by both Italy and Abyssinia. The current situation of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is better than in recent days. At that time, British cabinet members advocated that the tripartite conference should only study the clauses from a legal point of view (referring to the Anglo-French-Italian Treaty of 1906) and should not go beyond the scope of interpreting the clauses. But now this attitude has changed. The reason is that Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden has pointed out that if European countries fail to mediate the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, the impact on the League of Nations and the collective security system will be very serious. According to what Le Matin's correspondent knows, Eden has been ordered to act as he sees fit, but the government still urges him to be cautious. Furthermore, according to Le Journal's correspondent in London, "When British Minister Without Portfolio Anthony Eden discusses the Abyssinian issue with Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval today, he intends to put forward a strong theory to persuade France to listen, that is, if France does not support Britain's views and does not oppose the Italian-Abyssinian conflict, the European collective security system will suffer a fatal blow. Britain will retreat behind the scenes, and even if France is threatened by Germany, it will not come to France's aid. As for the work of maintaining Austria's independence, Britain will also turn a blind eye to it. In short, Britain will no longer resist the German-Austrian merger and will allow Germany to act freely. The above news is now no longer concealed by people in the British capital." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Three Suggestions: Whether Italy Can Accept Remains a Question</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers are competing to comment on the Paris Tripartite Conference, but their attitude is quite cautious and they do not make predictions about the outcome of the conference. The solutions published in foreign newspapers are dismissed as absurd. However, Il Giornale d'Italia discusses in detail the three main suggestions for resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute published in British newspapers: First, ceding huge economic benefits to Italy; second, stipulating that if Italy agrees not to go to war with Abyssinia, then the mandated territories and colonies should be re-demarcated so that Italy can also benefit; third, the League of Nations should administer Abyssinia. Other Italian newspapers have also published these suggestions, but none of them mentioned whether the Italian government would accept or reject them. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>France Holds the Key: The East African Question Affects the European Situation; Anglo-Italian Differences Are Not Easily Eliminated</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to today's news here, French Prime Minister Pierre Laval is now waiting for a secret note from the King of Abyssinia, which will be the basis for this Friday's Anglo-French-Italian conference. It seems that the Italian-Abyssinian issue now has a greater impact on the current situation in Europe, and France is in a pivotal position. As for the differences between Britain and Italy, they can be seen in the latest news. It is said that Britain has transported a large number of gas masks to Malta and has set up mines near it. Malta is a British naval base in the Mediterranean, only 45 miles from Italy's Sicily. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>United States Pays Close Attention</h3>
<p>(Paris) Abyssinian representative to the League of Nations, Mr. Heruy Walde, stated today that the Abyssinian Emperor would rather cede economic rights to other countries, but not to Italy. After Heruy Walde made this statement, the United States' interest in Abyssinia has greatly increased. Therefore, the American ambassador to France also stated today that the United States will maintain close contact and attention to the Anglo-French-Italian conference. According to general observations, the reason why Britain is so concerned about the East African issue is that it fears that after Italy conquers Abyssinia, it will use the excuse of maintaining the new territory to establish a naval base in the Red Sea, threatening Britain's routes to India and the Far East. (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Situation of the Paris Conference: Notified to the US and Japanese Governments at Any Time</h3>
<p>(London) When the British, French and Italian hold a conference in Paris, the British government will notify the American government of the progress of the negotiations at any time. According to the Daily Express correspondent in Paris, the Japanese government will also be treated the same as the United States and will be notified. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Snowden Discloses a Letter: Points to the League of Nations' Delaying Tactics</h3>
<p>(London) Former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, disclosed a letter in The Times today, saying that the delaying tactics of the League of Nations are in line with Italy's plan, because Italy's current goal is to complete its war preparations in a leisurely manner. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has clearly stated that he will attack Abyssinia and conquer it. He has declared his intention to oppose the League of Nations. If the League of Nations does not compete with him, then the League of Nations is finished. The tragic consequences are unimaginable. There will be serious incidents in various colonies. This situation contains all the elements of another world war. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinia Sends a Letter to the League of Nations: Accuses Various Countries of Unfairly Banning the Export of Arms</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinian representative to the League of Nations and Minister to France, Heruy Walde, recently sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Joseph Avenol, protesting that some member states of the League of Nations have taken unfair and one-sided actions against both Italy and Abyssinia. The note stated, "Although the arbitration procedures for the Italian-Abyssinian dispute have now been restarted, the Italian government is still continuing to transport troops and weapons to East Africa. Italian arms factories are rushing to manufacture a large number of weapons, which are obviously intended to be used to attack Abyssinia. As for Abyssinia, it does not have any government-run or private arms industries. The Abyssinian government wants to obtain defensive weapons from abroad, but it is all prohibited. All countries are banning the transportation of arms to Abyssinia. Can this method be said to be a fair and neutral attitude? Will the League of Nations Council sit idly by and allow the situation to deteriorate without taking any action? One of the parties in the dispute is a large country, so it is allowed to use all its resources to engage in aggression. On the contrary, the other party is a small country that respects peace and international promises, but it is not allowed to obtain weapons to protect its territorial independence. Will the League of Nations Council allow this unfair treatment to remain unchanged for a long time? The Abyssinian people have never threatened any other country. Will the League of Nations Council sit idly by and allow them to be slaughtered without taking responsibility?" (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Capital Provides Comprehensive Protection for Foreign Nationals: Promulgates Five Police Regulations</h3>
<p>The Abyssinian government in the Abyssinian capital has already taken various safety protection measures for foreign nationals in the country, but it is still not enough. Recently, five police regulations have been promulgated: (1) Regulations on the preparation and transportation of weapons by the people; (2) The police may at any time search and arrest suspicious local people and foreign nationals; (3) Increase the number of street police and plainclothes police; (4) Increase police posts at major intersections; (5) Double the number of patrol teams. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Italian Nationals: Organized into Blackshirt Troops</h3>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini has today approved the organization of overseas Italians who have applied to join the Blackshirts. The army is divided into four battalions, each with a thousand people, under the command of Colonel Carini, the director of the Overseas Italian Affairs Bureau. To date, 11,000 applications have been received. Because the physical examination is extremely strict, it is expected that many will be rejected. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<h3>Report on the Achievements of Public Works in Italian Eritrea</h3>
<p>(Rome) Il Giornale d'Italia published a report by the Italian High Commissioner for East Africa, De Bono, on the achievements of various public works projects held in Italian Eritrea in the past six months. According to the report, Massawa Port was the largest and safest port on the Red Sea, but in the past, it could only transport 300 tons of goods per day. Now the port has been expanded and can transport 3,600 tons of goods per day. Warehouses, docks and oil pools have been completed. The train from Massawa Port to Asmara used to run twice a day, but now it has increased to six times. In addition, the road improvement plan has been completed, including the repair of 109 kilometers of existing roads and the construction of 306 kilometers of new roads. Furthermore, 15 old wells have been repaired and 62 new wells have been drilled in Eritrea. As for the city of Asmara, the population was only 4,500 in the past, but now it has increased to 55,000. A water supply pipe is being built there, which can supply 375 gallons of drinking water per day after completion. The existing hospital in the territory has been expanded and telephones have also been installed. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>The authorities in Italian Tripoli in Alexandria have already formed several labor teams and transported them to Eritrea to serve. These workers are mostly recruited from eastern Tripoli. Traffic between Egypt and Tripoli has been completely stopped because of this, because the Arabs are deeply afraid that they will be forced to serve after crossing the border. The people's pro-Abyssinian spirit can be seen from the welcome received by the Egyptian Abyssinian consulate. It is said that the consulate will soon be upgraded to a embassy.

<h3>Franco-Italian Military Talks: Will Continue in Paris</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Tageblatt reports from Rome that Franco-Italian military talks began during General Gamelin's recent visit to Rome and will soon continue in Paris. Italian Army Chief of Staff General Pariani will visit France at the end of this month to reciprocate. The Franco-Italian military agreement stipulates that the Italian government may withdraw the border guards stationed on the Franco-Italian border. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Major Changes to British Air Routes: Base to be Set Up Near Portsmouth; Far East Aviation Company Established</h3>
<p>(London) According to the plan currently being discussed by the Air Ministry and Imperial Airways, there will be major changes to British air routes in the future. According to the aviation correspondent of the Zhengyi Evening News today, the authorities are now planning to build a large aviation base near Portsmouth to meet the needs of airships and large passenger planes. The air transportation of Imperial Airways and the future Atlantic Airways will be moved from Croydon Airport to that place. However, British aviation to Europe will still use Croydon Airport as the starting and landing point. The correspondent also learned that air transportation to India, Singapore, Australia and Cape Town will definitely be operated entirely by airships in the future. According to the official statement issued by the Air Ministry, the base for airships to operate on the Imperial Airways route has not yet been decided and is being actively considered. However, nothing can be announced at this time. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) The newly formed Imperial Airways (Far East) Company has been registered. The company has a fixed capital of £1 million, with each share costing £1. Its purpose is to operate air transportation and serve as the manager of Imperial Airways. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>Italy Also Suffers from Flooding: Continuous Heavy Rain Causes River Dikes to Collapse; City of Ovada Turns into a Swamp</h3>
<p>Near the city of Ovada, Liguria Province, Turin, Italy, there is an artificial lake called Molare, built by an electricity plant, with a capacity of 20 million cubic meters, using hydropower for electricity generation. Recently, due to continuous heavy rain, the dam on the lake suddenly collapsed, and the area around the city of Ovada was flooded. Traffic between that place and Molare was completely cut off. There are reports that the number of deaths in the disaster area is 40, and there are also reports that it is 500. The rumors are mixed and have not yet been confirmed. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Ovadese Lake in the Morale area of ​​the Liguria Province in northern Italy burst, and the floods overflowed. The Morale village was the first to bear the brunt. The residents were caught off guard by the sudden flood, and as many as 500 of the 700 people in the village were drowned. The four bridges connecting the village to the outside world were all destroyed, so traffic was completely cut off. The disaster in the city of Ovada was also severe. As of now, it is said that 100 people are missing, and their lives and deaths are unknown. However, most of the residents there heard that the lake gate was destroyed and immediately evacuated to the nearby mountainous areas, so fortunately, there were not many deaths.

<h3>Romanian Master Thief Escapes from Prison: Leads a Life of Robbing the Rich and Helping the Poor with a Robin Hood Spirit</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania - The Romanian master thief Croianu escaped from prison in the city of Botosani today. He used his moving eloquence not only to allow the jailer to calmly escape, but also to make Ruo Hua join the gang and listen to his command. This morning, when the guards changed shifts, the prison officials discovered that Croianu and the guards had already disappeared. Croianu has been arrested more than once, but has never been tried in court. The major cases Croianu has committed have made him a hero in the Maldavian region, because Croianu likes to rob the rich and distributes a part of the stolen goods to the farmers. When the pursuers arrive, the farmers hide him in a safe place to repay him. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota: Prepares to Meet Rose</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM on the 14th, stating that the British government has always carefully considered the economic situation in China and its methods of recovery.

<h3>Seeking to Strengthen Military Control of the Army: Japanese Minister of the Army Temporarily Does Not Retire; Three Chiefs Conference Decides on Policy; Strictly Warns All Subordinates to Rectify Military Discipline</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi feels a deep responsibility for this unfortunate incident. Since the incident occurred, he has been considering the issue of his advance and retreat. However, he recently realized that the mission of controlling the army is more important than the issue of responsibility. Therefore, he decided to first establish the fundamental policy of controlling the army. The Minister of the Army intends to visit Prime Minister Okada today to express his views on controlling the military. (Domei News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to discuss the appropriate handling of the Lieutenant General Nagata assassination incident and the active policy of controlling the interior, the Army has decided to wait for Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in to return to Tokyo from Hakone today to hold a Three Chiefs Conference. At that time, Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in, Minister of the Army Hayashi, Inspector General of Military Education Watanabe, Vice-Minister of the Army Hashimoto, Vice-Chief of Staff Sugiyama, and Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau Imai will attend. First, Minister of the Army Hayashi will explain in detail the Nagata assassination incident that has been clarified so far and the internal system since then. Regarding its countermeasures, the Minister of the Army will express his policy and his determination to implement it. Next, based on this, the Three Chiefs will deliberate carefully and establish a unified highest policy. Under the strong cooperation of the three departments of the Ministry of the Army, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Inspectorate General of Military Education, the three major departments of military administration, military command, and education will be implemented step by step, in order to establish control within the army. Minister of the Army Hayashi is not light-hearted about this matter. Regardless of the world's evaluation, he will implement what he believes in and dedicate himself to the country. Other chiefs and seniors also have the same feeling. Therefore, Minister of the Army Hayashi will never speak of his advance or retreat at the Three Chiefs Conference. (Den-tsu News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi invited Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in to the Minister's residence at 1:30 PM on the 14th and asked Inspector General of Military Education General Watanabe to come to the residence to hold a Three Chiefs Conference. Minister of the Army Hayashi first reported the true details of the Nagata Military Affairs Bureau Director assassination incident in great detail. Next, he expressed the necessity of maintaining strict military discipline and shared his belief in controlling the military. The Chief of Staff and the Inspector General of Military Education both expressed their agreement. As a result, the three decided on the following fundamental policies with a cautious attitude, and the meeting ended at around 2:00 PM. (1) In order to boost the morale of the national army and maintain strict discipline, soldiers are not allowed to act rashly. The national army should be controlled with a solemn attitude to give full play to its true nature. (2) The three chiefs will issue instructions to all their subordinate troops to strictly abide by military discipline in order to thoroughly implement the control work. (Domei News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the Army's Three Chiefs Conference, important instructions will be issued to the entire army as soon as possible. In order to thoroughly rectify military discipline and control the army, the Minister of the Army will soon convene a division commander's conference or a chiefs of staff conference or a group commander's conference. (Domei News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Hayashi is running around day and night, trying to clean up the situation and control the military. The Army's leaders and the government are also doing their best to help the Minister of the Army to achieve the great goal of controlling the national army. However, the Minister of the Army himself believes that this incident has a serious nature unprecedented since the founding of the country. When the Inspector General of Military Education was replaced a few days ago, the Army's interior was greatly shocked, and the incident occurred immediately afterwards, so it seems that he has a firm intention to resign. The Minister of the Army is carrying out the policy of controlling the military with the help of the government and the Army's leaders, and after everything is settled, he will resign to take responsibility according to his decision. (Domei News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Times said that foreign observers believe that the infighting within the Japanese Army is a struggle for power between conservatives and radicals. This is a fundamental mistake. Nagata was a confidant of Minister of the Army Hayashi and strongly supported Minister of the Army Hayashi's policy of prohibiting the Army from interfering in politics. This policy has aroused strong resistance from some members of the Army, who believe that the current domestic and international situation urgently requires the Army to have greater activity and participation in national affairs. The Minister of the Army has decided to maintain the Army as only a strong fighting force without interfering in foreign affairs, believing that the political activities of soldiers are enough to deviate from public opinion and create factions among soldiers.

<h3>The Criminal's Preliminary Trial is Expected to Last Two Months, with a Verdict Possible Within the Year</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa, the perpetrator of the assassination of former Army Affairs Bureau Chief Nagata, has had his general situation investigated by the Tokyo Military Police. He has been detained in the First Division Garrison Prison and assigned to the First Division Military Tribunal. The relevant officials have appointed Shimada Tomisaburo, the director of military affairs for the First Division, as the prosecutor, and Okada Tomoichi, the legal officer of the First Division, as the preliminary judge. After passing through Prosecutor Uda's hands, the case will then be transferred to the preliminary hearing. After an investigation by Preliminary Judge Noda, the defendant will be handed back to the prosecutor with a written opinion attached, and submitted to the division commander for formal indictment proceedings to begin the military tribunal process. However, given the nature of the incident, the officials in charge are expediting the investigation, aiming to complete the handling within about two months. Therefore, the preliminary hearing decision may be expedited, and a verdict may be announced within the year. (14th, Jiji News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Maintaining Global Silver Prices: The United States Purchases Silver in Large Quantities, Averaging Two Million Ounces Daily, Causing Unease in the London Market</h3>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources here today, the United States is purchasing as much as two million ounces of silver daily to maintain global silver prices. Previously, it had already made two large-scale purchases to prevent a sharp fall in northern silver prices, with one purchase amounting to as much as 50 million ounces. (13th, Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) It is reported that the US Treasury Department purchased approximately 320,000 ounces of silver in New York today at a price of 67.62 cents, followed by 250,000 ounces at 67.12 cents. It is noted that the previous purchase price of large foreign bars was 68 cents. Some observers suggest that speculators anticipated that the US Treasury Department would soon raise silver prices, thus creating a position of great power. The Treasury Department, aware of this, is unwilling to provide further support at its previously fixed price, aiming to eliminate speculators while continuing to purchase silver at lower prices. (13th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York commercial circles have learned that the US Treasury Department has now ceased silver purchases in foreign markets. It is rumored that Washington intends to abolish the silver purchase program established under the 1934 Silver Purchase Act. This news is considered credible by New York banking circles. It is also said that the government does not plan to abolish the Silver Purchase Act during this congressional term, but will merely quietly terminate its silver purchase program. As for the obligation to purchase silver to establish a gold-silver ratio of four to one, this will be deferred to the future. (14th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department estimated today that the government has profited $216,567,067 since implementing the silver purchase plan. The source of this huge profit is due to purchasing silver at market prices and minting it at a price of $1.29 per ounce. It is claimed that $147,299,823 of the profit was derived from purchasing silver in the global market, and the remainder from domestic silver production. In total, the United States' minting profits have reached $60 million. Comparing this figure with the profits from the silver purchase plan illustrates the extent of the Treasury Department's recent activities. (13th, Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas, the leader of the silver advocates, attributed the low silver prices to the Treasury Department's cessation of silver purchases. Even the Treasury Department purchasing at low prices does not reflect the intent of the Silver Purchase Act. Thomas stated, "If silver is purchased and then stored away, it is meaningless. What we need is for the price of silver to rise. If China's currency were linked to the British pound, we could benefit greatly, as we are the country with the largest gold reserves. This is certainly not something I would oppose." (13th, Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph, the News Chronicle, the Daily Mail, and the Financial News have all published articles commenting on the fall in silver prices. The Financial News stated, "The American authorities have indicated that they are not prepared to permanently maintain silver prices at a certain level. Therefore, speculators are unloading their inventories in a rush. Consequently, silver merchants generally express some degree of unease regarding the status of silver." (14th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Financial reporters hold differing opinions regarding the future trend of silver. The Times states that while long positions have greatly decreased, they are still not small. If the US authorities feel that they will not be forced to absorb a large amount of silver, they may change their policy of suppressing silver prices. The Financial Times reports that speculators may rush to sell the silver they have purchased in the coming days. If this happens, the US Treasury Department's active assistance will be the only way to avoid a complete collapse of the silver market. The Exchange Telegraph reports that US officials absorbed between 11 million and 12 million ounces of silver yesterday. It is estimated that the United States has purchased approximately 200 million ounces of silver in the London market in the past two months. The positions of long-term speculators have almost completely been liquidated. Now that the silver market has been cleared, a rebound in silver prices is expected. The Daily Telegraph claims that the fortunes of American silver rise and fall with political forces. President Roosevelt is now in a dilemma. He does not want to pay unnecessarily high prices for silver, but he also knows that if he does not purchase in large quantities, the silver market will be chaotic. Therefore, he is solving this problem by gradually lowering the purchase price. Speculators are benefiting from this. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. The East still holds a large amount of silver, and it remains to be seen whether or not it will be sold. Future events depend on the inscrutable actions of the East and the inscrutable policies of President Roosevelt. Who can predict them? (14th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tao Shangming's Detention: The Japanese Side Believes Tao is Related to the Liu Zuozhou Case; Rescue Efforts are Underway, but the Japanese Have Agreed to Release Him, but Have Not Yet Done So</h3>
<p>Beiping correspondence: Tao Shangming, the former Administrative Commissioner of the Aoyu District, was transferred to serve as a counselor in the Political Readjustment Committee. He handed over his duties in Tangshan and came to Beiping to take up his new post. Coincidentally, the Liu Zuozhou assassination case occurred, and the Japanese side suspected that Tao was related to the case. At 3:00 PM on the 5th, he was detained by the Japanese Embassy and has not been released since. Since this event occurred, the outside world has been quite unclear about the true situation. The details of the events are briefly described as follows. Tao is fluent in Japanese and has served as a negotiator in Fengtian, handling diplomatic relations with Japan. During his tenure as Administrative Commissioner in the Luanyu District, he assumed some of the responsibilities of coordination and had many contacts with Japanese personnel. This time, Tao returned to Beiping on the third night after handing over his duties as Commissioner, and the Liu Zuozhou assassination case in Luanzhou happened to occur on the 4th, which was a coincidence. Unexpectedly, it greatly aroused the suspicion of the Japanese side. After Tao returned to Beiping, the next day was a Sunday. At 8:00 AM on the 5th, Tao went to the Political Readjustment Committee to meet with Acting Chairman Wang Kemin to report on the handover process. He then took up the position of counselor. When Liu Zuozhou was assassinated, Japanese military police officer Uemura was wounded by a stray bullet, which greatly dissatisfied the Japanese side. At 11:50 AM on the 5th, Sakai, Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Garrison, and Iga, head of the Yuguan Special Service Agency, came to Beiping from Tianjin. At 2:00 PM, they went to the Diplomatic Building to meet with Acting Chairman Wang to raise serious questions about the Liu case. They left at 3:00 PM and returned to the Japanese Embassy. Believing that Tao was heavily suspected of being involved in the case, they discussed in the military attache's office and decided to invite Tao to the embassy. At 3:30 PM, Banhon contacted Tao by phone, asking Tao to come to the embassy immediately to discuss matters. Tao was meeting guests at his private residence at the time. After receiving the phone call, he went with his follower, Mr. Liu. After a 20 minute meeting, the Japanese side stated that Tao was related to the Liu case. Despite Tao's best efforts to defend himself, it was ineffective, and he was detained in the military attache's office. After the Japanese subjected Tao's follower and car driver to detailed searches, they were released. Tao's family was very anxious upon hearing the news. His wife went to the Political Readjustment Committee to report the situation and asked for help with the rescue. The Political Readjustment Committee considered the matter to be of great importance, so it sent personnel to contact the Japanese side on the one hand, and telegraphed the central government on the other hand to report the situation and request instructions. Tao's paternal uncle and his younger brother, Shangyu, also came to Beiping one after another to coordinate with all parties to find ways to rescue him. In recent days, Jing Rugeng and others have used their personal relationships to intercede with the Japanese side. The Japanese side has gradually understood and agreed to release him today, but he has not yet been released as of tonight. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the Japanese side about this matter, but the Japanese side has not yet responded. Tao is being treated quite well in the Japanese Embassy, and Tao's wife also visits the Japanese Embassy from time to time. (August 13th)</p>

<p>(8) Tea Rooms in Guangzhou's Culinary Scene</p>
<p>Eating in Guangzhou is truly world-renowned. From snacks costing five cents to a dime, to grand meals costing hundreds of yuan per table, almost every building is a place to eat. Even street vendors are constantly shouting to sell food. The most common and affordable places are tea rooms. Besides enjoying tea, one can freely have a snack. The taste is delicious and the prices are fair. People in Guangzhou spend one or two hours, or even six or seven hours, in tea rooms every day. Meeting friends, chatting, eating, and drinking tea all take place there. The business of tea rooms is booming, but in the midst of the worldwide economic crisis, Guangzhou is no exception. Recently, all stores have been offering major discounts, and hotels are cutting prices by 50% or 60%. Even the grand restaurants are loudly offering wholesale prices for entire tables of food. Therefore, the superficially strong Guangzhou market is indeed difficult to maintain. The tea room business has also been affected. Even those who love to eat are starting to think twice and eat at home. Recently, tea room owners, as if in a league, have been hiring female hostesses to attract customers, which has managed to restore some business. Grand restaurants, on the other hand, are using mahjong to attract customers. In the middle of the night, the sound of shuffling tiles can be clearly heard on the streets. Grand hotels are using cigarettes and tobacco to entice customers. Each has its own way of attracting customers. The reporter stayed in Guangzhou for three days and took a public bus once. The bus was small and crowded, and armed personnel had to get on the bus to patrol at any time, which felt very uncomfortable. The horn of the public bus can be stretched to a minute, like the whistle of a ship entering the port, which can startle people from their sleep. In the Shanghai concessions, the crackdown on cars honking their horns for no reason is very strict, and the law is enforced like a mountain, which is indeed much cleaner. The Guangzhou municipal authorities should pay special attention to this point.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Pearl River Vessels</p>
<p>(9) The Situation of the Guangsan Railway</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in Guangzhou for three days. Although the weather was only in the nineties, it was sultry and hot from morning to night, and it was impossible to sleep peacefully all night, which was very painful. On the 5th, I left Guangzhou for Wuzhou. I had previously gone to the Guangzhou office of the Fourth Group Army to inquire about how to get to Wuzhou. The staff was very kind and spoke the Guilin dialect, which was almost the same as Mandarin. They said: First, you can take a small ferry directly from here to Wuzhou, but the ferry is small and crowded, and there is only one ferry every five days, which takes two nights to arrive, and is not comfortable and economical. Second, you can cross the river from here, take the Guangsan train from Shweitang to Sanshui, and then transfer to the Hong Kong-Wuzhou steamer to Wuzhou, which arrives the next day and is more convenient. Therefore, the reporter bought a train ticket to Sanshui from the China Travel Service, and asked for a copy of the departure schedule of the ferry across the river and the train schedule, stating that the ferry would depart from Xihoukou at 10:40 a.m., and the train would depart from Shweitang at 11:10 a.m. The reporter arrived at the ferry dock at 10:10 a.m. and boarded the ferry at 10:20 a.m. Unexpectedly, it did not depart until 11:30 a.m. When asked, the person in charge said that the time here is often changed, and the printed schedule cannot be taken as accurate. This is one thing. After crossing the river, the train departed at 12:10 p.m. There was no ticket inspector on the platform, and no formal red-hatted porter. Passengers crowded in with the old and the young, and the principle of equality was implemented. Those who bought third-class tickets occupied the first and second-class carriages, and the armed comrades were even more impolite, lying down on the first-class seats until the train arrived at Sanshui, when they yawned and got up. This is another thing. A certain employee in uniform on the train took a young lady and sat in the first-class carriage. When the ticket inspector came, they nodded to each other, and the ticket was not checked. They got off the train halfway without paying a penny. This is another thing. It is said that among the railways in Guangdong, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, which is jointly run by China and the United Kingdom, is the best. The southern section of the Yuehan Railway and the Guangsan Railway are inferior, and the Chaoshan Railway is even worse. The Guangsan Railway once had a prosperous business, but this year it has been affected by the rural depression, and its business has plummeted. Moreover, due to too many employees and heavy expenses, it loses more than ten thousand yuan a month, resulting in a lifeless state. The floods along the Guangsan Railway are also extremely serious, with vast expanses of water or only the roofs of houses exposed, which is extremely miserable.</p>
<p>(10) The Scenery of the West River and the Huabiao Stone</p>
<p>When exiting Sanshui Station, dozens of boatmen solicit business, shouting and scrambling as if they were going to devour the passengers alive. Two or three policemen drove them away with sticks, but they scattered and gathered again, and the chaos reached its peak. It is urgent to find a way to reform this situation. Along the way, there were also advertising signs for the Hong Kong-Wuzhou steamer, shouting loudly. After walking hundreds of steps, I hired a small boat and zigzagged to board the Guangying, a steamer operating between Hong Kong and Wuzhou. The steamer was extremely clean, about a thousand tons. Standing on the deck and looking at the scenery, the river breeze brushed my face, and I felt refreshed. The steamer set sail at 5:00 p.m., sailing up the West River. The mountains were stacked on top of each other, and the river flowed tortuously. The steamer sailed along the foot of the mountains, with wisps of smoke rising from the cooking fires, echoes of pastoral songs, and fishing boats swaying, with conical hats and hunched figures, creating a beautiful natural picture that broadened my mind. The scenery of the West River is similar to that of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, with solemn and dangerous natural barriers. At first glance, it seems that there is no way through, but suddenly there is a way out. In summer, when traveling by boat, the river breeze is gentle, and the heat is completely dispelled, and the beautiful scenery is enough to cast aside endless worries. Of all the trips the reporter took until arriving in Wuzhou, this river trip was the most enjoyable. After a night of restful sleep, I woke up very early in the morning. At about 8:00 a.m., when passing Liujiangkou on the river surface, I suddenly saw a peak protruding, with a huge stone growing out of the top, covering the entire mountain top, like a huge stone tablet standing upright, which can be called a wonder. Looking at it from afar with a telescope, there were three large characters "Huabiao Stone" carved on the back of the stone, each a foot in diameter. When asked, people on the boat said that visitors who climb to the top of the mountain can sit on the huge stone. Many of the strokes of the stone carvings have been peeled off, which must have been after a long period of time. Due to upstream flash floods, the river water has risen sharply, and many low-lying areas in the cities along the river have been submerged. The steamer arrived in Wuzhou at 2:00 p.m. The reception staff and police officers boarded the steamer to welcome us, and we took a small boat to Guangxi University to rest. The annual meeting members were staying there.</p>
<p>(11) Labor and Women's Occupations</p>
<p>The liveliness, bravery, and physical strength of women in Guangdong and Guangxi are far beyond the reach of the delicate and frail women of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. When I arrived in Guangzhou, the labor force on the streets was almost equally divided between men and women. Women are engaged in various occupations. Going upstream along the river to Wuzhou, the proportion of women participating in activities gradually increased. Almost all of the baggage carriers at the Sanshui Station were women, ranging in age from twelve or thirteen to forty or fifty. Most of them wore black silk shirts and pants, and were barefoot, with large straw hats, as if they were in uniform. They carried shoulder poles and could carry objects weighing hundreds of pounds. When the reporter got off the train, a young working girl very enthusiastically took my luggage and walked as fast as the wind. I was very ashamed and struggled to keep up behind her with my hands empty. On many small boats, there were also women, either mothers and daughters or mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, helping to row the oars. Although the reporter and they were separated by language, they never cheated. The small boat approached the large steamer, and the current was turbulent. They skillfully pulled the rope and securely docked the boat. Then, they helped the passengers take their luggage into the cabin. Giving them a penny or two for wine money made them very satisfied and they thanked me repeatedly. When the steamer stopped along the way, there were many women boaters rowing small boats full of fruits, tobacco, and various daily necessities, approaching the side of the steamer and shouting loudly to sell their goods. Their voices were clear and exciting. There was another kind of touching sound wave. There were even more working women in Wuzhou City. They could do anything that men could do. They were also active outside, earning money, and equally sharing the various rights and obligations of the family, truly achieving equal work for men and women. Once, the reporter hired a small boat to tour the river. The boat was manned by a middle-aged couple and a child who was less than one year old. Sometimes the child fell asleep and was placed under the deck. When he woke up and cried, the wife would row the oars while using her feet to rock the child's body. Sometimes she would carry the child on her back in a cloth bag, which did not hinder any work. However, women's education is too poor. Most of the working women are illiterate. Perhaps those who have received education are unwilling to work so hard.</p>
<p>(12) Touring Wuzhou</p>
<p>Wuzhou is the commercial center of Guangxi, with prosperous streets and magnificent buildings. However, due to recent flash floods and rising river waters, many low-lying streets have been submerged. In addition, the rural areas are depressed, and the market is in an extremely sluggish state. According to people in the shops, the business this year is only about two-thirds of last year's. There are cars and rickshaws in the city, but they are rarely seen. Most people walk. Wuzhou is surrounded by mountains, and many streets are built on mountain slopes. The river flows through the city, and the scenery is very beautiful. There is a tung oil factory, a pharmaceutical factory, a waterworks, and a sulfuric acid factory jointly run by Guangdong and Guangxi. On the afternoon of the 7th, more than 200 annual meeting members arrived one after another, and were accompanied by receptionists to tour the city and visit the various factories. The tung oil factory is relatively well-developed, with a capital of 100,000 yuan. Preparations began in September last year, and work began on May 1st this year. Guangxi's annual output of tung oil is more than 200,000 dan, most of which has not been refined and has poor composition. When exported in Hong Kong, it is difficult to sell at a good price. Therefore, the provincial authorities are striving to rectify the situation. The purpose of running this factory is to inspect the quality of tung oil and to refine impurities. It is stipulated that oil merchants must send their oil to the factory for inspection or refining before exporting. The refining fee is 6 jiao and 5 fen per city dan. At the time, the merchants were quite worried. In May, when the factory first opened, the business was very slow. In June, those requesting refining reached more than 4,000 dan, and those requesting inspection reached more than 3,000 dan. In July, it increased to more than 16,000 dan. The trend of continued growth this month still continues. Normally, it can only be sold for more than 30 yuan per dan in Hong Kong. After refining, the selling price increases, so merchants are happy to send it for refining. It is truly a beneficial business that achieves two goals at once. The manager is Guo Canglong, the technician is Wen Xiangxing, and the technicians are Xu Wenbin and Jia Weiting. There are more than 20 workers. Next, we visited the pharmaceutical factory, which is divided into a chemical analysis department and a pharmaceutical manufacturing department. It also opened on January 1st this year, and the order is well-organized and full of spirit. The sulfuric acid factory was originally jointly run by Guangdong and Guangxi. The sales of sulfuric acid in Guangxi were very sluggish, and it is now in a state of shutdown. The factory's capital reached more than 800,000 yuan, all of which has been lost, and only the machinery remains to generate income.</p>

<p>(13) The Current Situation of Guangxi University</p>
<p>Guangxi University is the only university in Guangxi Province. It is built on Butterfly Mountain in Wuzhou, with beautiful scenery. The annual meeting members are all lodged there. It takes about half a mile to walk from the gate to the dormitory, and the dining hall is on the top of the mountain, which takes another half a mile. This is to train students to run. The campus covers an area of about a thousand acres, surrounded by mountains. There are 21 buildings, including classrooms, dormitories, libraries, and auditoriums. The regular expenses are more than 20,000 yuan per month, which are remitted on time without delay. There are currently more than 300 undergraduate students and more than 400 high school students. The undergraduates are co-educational, but the high school is not. The undergraduates are divided into five departments: agriculture, forestry, mining, engineering, and science. The president is Ma Junwu, and the vice president is Pan Zhuqi. The school pays special attention to military training, and the students are exceptionally simple and hardworking. There are many students who stay on campus during the summer to work and tutor. The students can take on extremely hard work, such as carrying earth, washing clothes, and doing carpentry. The school subsidizes them with more than ten yuan per month, which is not like the university students in other cities who can only live a comfortable life. Most of the students' uniforms are made of locally produced gray cloth, and all have shaved heads. When on campus, they get up at 4:30 in the morning and start military training. Each quarter, each class can select two outstanding students who are completely exempt from tuition fees. Although the university is co-educational, the boundaries are very strict. This year is the first class to graduate, all in science. There are 31 graduates, 8 of whom are retained to work at the school, and the rest are all going to Nanning. The provincial government has agreed to assign them jobs, which can avoid the pain of unemployment upon graduation. At 7:30 p.m. on the 7th, Guangxi University President Ma Junwu and Vice President Pan Zhuqi held a welcome meeting for the annual meeting members in the auditorium. Ma Jun gave a speech, which was extremely humble, saying that he hoped for guidance in everything. The accommodation and meals in the dormitory were very cordial, but the order was slightly chaotic due to the large number of people, which was also unavoidable. They are now departing for Nanning in two batches. The reporter departed with the first batch at 9:00 p.m. on the 8th. That evening at 6:00 p.m., President Ma Junwu and Wuzhou Public Security Bureau Chief Hao Huan hosted a banquet for everyone at the Dongtian Restaurant. After the meal, they boarded the steamer and are expected to arrive around the 11th. (Sent from Wuzhou on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Pregnant Woman Drowns After Losing Footing While Washing Clothes</h3>
<p>Zhao, the daughter-in-law of Wang Xuetang, a resident of Xima Bridge, Fenglezhen in this city, was 28 years old. Her husband, Runhe, worked as a clerk at the Xinhe Pawnshop in Zhujing. Since their marriage, they had had one son and one daughter, but the son died young. She was recently pregnant again, already six months along, and with a large belly. Everyone said she had the look of bearing a son, to fulfill the Wang family's hopes. However, the pregnant woman went to the riverside to wash clothes at about 1:00 p.m. today and did not return home for a long time. Her family went to look for her and only saw her clothes on the riverside. Knowing that something bad had happened, they searched for her body. It was not until about 6:00 p.m. that a cargo boat found her body in the same place. It is now being kept at the public cemetery so that her family can return to Songjiang with a coffin.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Water Police Dispatch Warships to Arrest Scattered Bandits</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the section chief of the Second Water Police District reported that a large group of scattered bandits, about thirty or forty people, armed with guns, had been discovered in the vicinity of Wangting Township in recent days and were plotting something bad. After receiving the report, Section Chief Zhou immediately ordered Xu Lianxun, the captain of the Baosu Patrol Ship, to lead the ship to patrol various places in Wangting Township, and ordered the detective team to send detectives to arrest the scattered bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Appeal to Exempt Wheat Bran from Taxes</h3>
<p>The Oil Mill Industry Association of this county recently received a letter from its members Hengde Oil Mill and Runfengchang Oil Mill stating that Guangzhou tax merchants are planning to levy a surcharge of 25 cents per picul on wheat bran transported from anywhere. However, this wheat bran is made from soybeans, which is a domestic fertilizer essential for farmland in rural areas. The Ministry of Finance and the Southwest Political Committee have issued announcements that domestic sales are tax-exempt. Now, the Guangdong Provincial Government has abolished 42 kinds of arbitrary taxes and levies, but the tax merchants are blinded by greed and disregard the burden on merchants and the public. If the levy is implemented, it will not only promote the sales of imported fertilizers and put domestic industry and commerce in a desperate situation, but also completely violate the government's repeated orders to maintain the domestic product case. After receiving the letter, the association yesterday forwarded it to the county chamber of commerce, requesting it to telegraph the Guangdong authorities and make every effort to stop it, and also telegraphed the Guangzhou City Chamber of Commerce to strive for it together in order to protect domestic products.</p>
<h3>Wife and Concubine Quarrel Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>Wang Gengquan, a 30-year-old resident of Wangjiali Lane, Xinan Township, Beiqiao, Third District, was a coppersmith foreman at the Sixth Japanese Cotton Mill on Xiaoshadu in Shanghai, earning a good income. His wife, Zhu, had given birth to two sons and one daughter. However, Wang was lustful. In November of last year, he became involved with a female worker named Zhang at the same factory and took her as his concubine. Unfortunately, this did not last long. Gengquan was dismissed by the factory for poor work. In June of this year, he took Zhang home, causing frequent quarrels between his wife and concubine. The day before yesterday evening, the first wife had another argument with Zhang. In a fit of anger, Zhang committed suicide by hanging herself that night. Later, her husband discovered it, but she had already died and could not be revived. The next day, Qian Yaoqing, the head of the Nian Liu Wu Tu, reported the case to the prosecutor's office, requesting an autopsy. Prosecutor Shen led a forensic examiner Wang and bailiffs to the countryside to perform an autopsy, which confirmed that she had died by suicide by hanging. After the autopsy, he ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial and await further investigation.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: More Than 800,000 Land Value Tax Collected</h3>
<p>The Wuyi County government is making every effort to collect the first and second installments of the 23rd-year land tax, as ordered by the provincial government. It has been quite effective in recent months. Recently, with the approach of the provincial finance department's performance evaluation, it has continued to rigorously collect the taxes. It has ordered tax collection police to go to the countryside to collect the taxes and ordered that all taxes be cleared by August 20th, and that property be sealed up for payment if the deadline is missed. According to the settlement of Wei Furong and Mao Zhongsheng, the directors of the east and west tax bureaus, 89% of the total amount has been collected. It is estimated that the east bureau has collected more than 500,000 yuan, and only more than 70,000 yuan has not been collected. The west bureau has collected 400,000 yuan, and only 70,000 to 80,000 yuan has not been collected. It is expected that all taxes can be collected before and after the deadline, except for the urban areas.</p>

<h3>Trial Opens for the Yuxi Burial Case</h3>
<p>Chen Wuxuan of Yuxi was buried alive in the bottom of the Shijia River at midnight by local bullies Cao Si, Cai Er, Que Er, and Meng Sanjiazi due to a dispute over a prostitute. After Chen Wuxuan's father, Chen Jinyu, found out about it, he reported it to the district office, which arrested the perpetrators and sent them to the court to dig up the river for investigation. The criminal court opened the trial on the 13th. Cao Si and others all confessed to the crime and were detained pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Abortion Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>Rui Zhi, the daughter of widow Ji of Pingtung Township, Fifth District, a little north of Shizheng Elementary School, is 20 years old and has a fair appearance. Recently, she was seduced by her neighbor, Zhang Yinggou, and became pregnant. Fearing that her mother would find out, she asked a midwife named Zheng from Xiqiao to prescribe medicine for an abortion on the 8th of this month. However, after taking the medicine, she experienced severe abdominal pain and incessant bleeding, and the fetus did not come out. She died on the morning of the 10th. Widow Ji found out the truth and was very sad and angry. Yesterday (the 12th) afternoon, she petitioned the county government to arrest Zhang Yinggou and the midwife Zheng for investigation. It is reported that Zhang and Zheng fled after the incident.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Water Level in the Inland Canal Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Since the Yellow River water flooded into the central Grand Canal, the water level in various sections of the inland canal has continued to rise in recent days. Therefore, the residents on both sides of the canal are all trembling and working together with the canal workers to be on alert. On the 13th, the water level in each section was measured as 34.315 meters at the Hanzhuang Hukou, 34.287 meters in the Hanzhuang Canal, 30.37 meters in Pixun, 5.818 meters at the Gaoyou unloading wharf, 5.910 meters in the Gaoyou Wanjiatang Lake, 4.955 meters at the Shaobo Sanggou Lock, and 5.225 meters in the Sanggou Lock Lake.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Police Officer Indicted for Accidental Shooting Death</h3>
<p>The case of Ruan Hongkui, a police officer from the Fifth Precinct of the Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, accidentally shooting and killing Lu Meihong, an employee of the Huajinli Clock and Watch Inlay Shop, has been prosecuted. Initially, the Public Security Bureau only transferred the suspected apprentice Zhou Shanqing to the court, while the police officer who caused the accident was retained by the bureau, causing public outrage in the area. Local gentry Yang Yaowen and Ling Shuixin, along with 33 shops in Nanxingqiao, jointly published a newspaper, raising six questions to the bureau, accusing it of protecting the police and perverting the law. The Hangzhou Court specially dispatched Prosecutor Chen Huaming to investigate. He determined that Lu Meihong died from a bullet entering her head and that the claim of wiping the gun was also a light way to state the facts. He prosecuted the case as one of causing death by negligence. The suspected apprentice Zhou Shanqing was released as he had no involvement.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Rickshaw Owner's Disappearance Raises Suspicion</h3>
<p>Shen Guangfeng (also known as Shen Aliuli), the owner of the Litongfeng Rickshaw Shop on Chunbo Bridge in Jiaxing, is from Yancheng, Jiangbei. He has a second son, Wenxin, who is 17 years old and works at the rickshaw shop every day. He is often sent out to collect rent from the rickshaw pullers, which is his usual job. At about 7:00 a.m. on the 11th, he went to the South Gate to collect rickshaw rent and did not return for a long time. A letter was delivered by the postman, stating that it was sent from this port. The letter stated that Guangfeng had treated people too poorly, so they had kidnapped his second son and were asking for 500 yuan, and would contact him later. It was signed Gao Xiaoheng. After reading the letter, Guangfeng was extremely alarmed and learned that his son was kidnapped in the Jishi Street area of the city. He immediately reported to the Shanshui Police Headquarters, which ordered the police to investigate. On the 12th, at the agreed location (near the Xinyang Bridge in the West Gate), they found a person holding a signal waiting there. The police went to investigate, but the bandit had disappeared. However, it was found that Shen Guangfeng's family was of average wealth, and his son's sudden disappearance was very strange.</p>
<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>Letter from Tang Zhigao</p>
<p>I have read the letter from Zhou Xuewen et al. in Shen Bao on the 3rd of this month, refuting my letter of July 27th requesting a correction. They stated that the Nijiatan is a local public property, and its ownership belongs to the local public, not to the Jiazi Disaster Memorial Association, etc. I believe that the official certificate serves as proof of property rights. Since the Memorial Association holds the official certificate, the ownership of the land naturally belongs to the Memorial Association. The original letter stated that there were two official certificates, and that the Zhang Shude household was redeemed through donations from local citizens such as Zheng Bocang, and not redeemed by the Jiazi Disaster Memorial Association. How could it be falsely claimed as belonging to the Memorial Association? The Memorial Association is essentially an empty shell, and everything relies on its members. Zheng Bocang and others were the initiators of the Memorial Association, and there is documented proof of this. Yet, they are being referred to as non-members, which is utterly ridiculous. The original letter stated that since the Nijiatan is a public property where permanent occupation is forbidden, and not a private property of the Jiazi Disaster Memorial Association, Tang Zhigao, Yin Shisheng, and a few other individuals cannot use the Memorial Association's name to dispose of the altar. Since the construction of the memorial pavilion at the Nijiatan, it has been registered and approved, and it is not a private property. We, who manage the association affairs, are impartial and selfless. If it is said that a few individuals cannot dispose of the altar, then who is in charge of the Memorial Association? The original letter stated that the excavated remains have been collected into thirty-one wooden boxes, and it was publicly agreed to seal them up and bury them on a selected date. Why were they secretly buried by hired laborers in the dead of night before the due date? This time, after the prosecutor arrived at the tomb to excavate and examine, why did the location not match the indicated location? Why were there missing boxes? Why were some seals present and some absent? Why were the remains in the boxes in different states of dryness and moisture? And why was there an empty box? When constructing houses and renovating the pavilion at the Nijiatan, the discovery of remains naturally led to their burial. Why is anyone else's advice needed? The prosecutor only verified thirty boxes at the altar, which is certainly not incorrect. As for the presence or absence of seals, it has been more than three months since the burial, and they would naturally have decayed. Regarding the different states of dryness and moisture of the remains, if it is said that the dry ones were the original bones, then where did the moist ones come from? If it is said that the moist ones were the original bones, then where did the dry ones come from? It should be known that the soil has varying degrees of dryness, and therefore the remains have varying degrees of dryness and moisture. The principle is very clear. As for the empty box, the workers buried it simply because they saw a box; there was no other intention. If it is said that it was intentionally discarded, what use would dry bones be? The various criticisms in that letter are excessively troublesome. The original letter stated that the six hundred and twenty-one yuan from Pastor Bu was his congratulatory gift at the time. Pastor Bu intended to donate it to the orphanage as an education fund. Tang Zhigao violated his intention and had someone find a way to take it back for the purpose of dismantling the pavilion and destroying the tomb. Pastor Bu still speaks of it with heartache. This is nothing short of slander. According to that letter, everything stated is the opposite of the truth. See the Shen Bao of the 7th; Pastor Bu has already issued a special letter clarifying it. The original letter stated that forty-eight wounded soldiers were buried in the sixteenth year. The roster of wounded soldiers at the Fifth Convalescent Hospital clearly records the month, day, and location of their deaths and burials, and it has been reported to the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society, with records available. At that time, wounded soldiers from various locations were mostly buried on the spot. The construction of the memorial pavilion was completed in the sixteenth year of the Republic. In that year, not a single coffin was buried at the altar. We personally witnessed it, so this can be called blatant lying. Recalling that in March and April of this year, Zhou Xuewen and others filed lawsuits one after another, and also published in various newspapers, saying that unscrupulous gentry stole and sold the Nijiatan, and at the same time, demolished Pastor Bu's memorial pavilion and exhumed the remains. I considered it worthless and did not argue with them, knowing that the truth would eventually come to light. In the future, if any such writing is discovered again, I implore the public to discern it clearly and not waste any more breath. Initiated by Tang Zhigao, representative of the Songjiang Jiazi Disaster Memorial Association, 24, 8, 10.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu and Others Negotiate for Emergency Flood Relief Loans; China, Communications, and Three Banks Advance 300,000 Yuan; Other Banks Advance 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 10th. Recognizing the urgent need for relief in the disaster areas, and the need to plan for relief funds, Mayor Wu Tiecheng convened a meeting at Wanglu on Haige Road at 4:30 PM on the afternoon of the 12th. Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Jinglai, Chen Guangfu, Lu Bohong, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Puqing, Yu Zuoting, and others attended the meeting to discuss borrowing 500,000 yuan from banks for emergency relief. During the meeting, it was approved that Mayor Wu, Lu Bohong, Chen Guangfu, and Wang Xiaolai would negotiate separately. It is heard that Mayor Wu has negotiated with the Central, China, and Communications banks for a loan of 300,000 yuan, and the three banks will hold a meeting to allocate the loan amounts. The remaining 200,000 yuan will also be negotiated separately by Lu Bohong and Chen Guangfu. When the Bankers' Association convened a regular meeting the day before yesterday, it specifically brought this matter up for discussion and unanimously approved it. Therefore, yesterday the Bankers' Association specially issued a notice to all member banks, confirming the amount to be held. All banks are accepting these loans as a charitable act. Once confirmed, they will be submitted to the Flood Relief Association for distribution and emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Notice: Unify Fundraising Organizations; No Need to Establish Separate Names and Issue Donation Appeals</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of this city, issued Notice No. 259 yesterday to unify the handling of fundraising for emergency flood relief in various provinces in this city. Since the beginning of summer this year, continuous rain and flooding have caused severe disasters in Hubei, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other provinces, urgently requiring relief. Various charitable organizations and relief agencies in this city have been eagerly calling for help out of benevolence and a desire to provide assistance. However, this matter is significant, and without a unified fundraising organization, it will be difficult to concentrate efforts. All sectors of this city, recognizing this, have already initiated the organization and establishment of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces to handle fundraising for emergency flood relief in various provinces in a unified manner, in order to seek assistance. In the future, all charitable organizations and relief agencies in this city should participate together to fully assist the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces in urging donations. There is no need to establish separate names and issue donation appeals to avoid fragmentation. All relief funds and relief supplies should be distributed by the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces to concentrate efforts and provide assistance. It is hoped that people at home and abroad will generously donate grain and funds to relieve the disaster victims and mitigate the catastrophe. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Instruction: Accumulate Old Uniforms for Relief; Railway Bureau Ordered All Departments to Comply Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Railway Administration Bureau yesterday issued an instruction to all departments stating: In accordance with a telegram from the Ministry of Railways, this year's floods have caused severe disasters in various provinces, with urgent needs for relief. This railway is instructed to immediately collect all accumulated old uniforms, including single-layer, lined, woolen, and cotton clothing, trousers, and outerwear, regardless of whether they are complete or damaged, and report the number to the ministry for verification. Once a location is designated, a telegram will be sent instructing them to be transported for relief. This should be complied with. All employees, public servants, miscellaneous workers, chauffeurs, messengers, gatekeepers, etc., who received new uniforms for the winter of last year and the summer of this year, should return all old uniforms and send them to the materials department and materials factory as soon as possible for collection and organization, with the number reported to the ministry for verification. In addition to distribution, you are instructed to comply and not delay. This order.</p>
<h3>Consulate General in Batavia Reports to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission: Reports of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Dutch East Indies Are Completely Inaccurate</h3>
<p>In recent years, overseas Chinese have occasionally been subjected to incidents of exclusion due to the impact of the economic crisis. Judging from the recent situation, the status of overseas Chinese seems to be improving day by day, and their situation is also gradually improving. However, a Hong Kong newspaper recently published a news item entitled "Returned Overseas Chinese Describe the Truth of the Dutch East Indies' Abuse of Overseas Chinese," which stated that the government of the Dutch East Indies ordered overseas Chinese to leave the country, prohibited overseas Chinese education, Chinese newspapers, inspected letters, and increased the entry tax to 1,000 guilders. It also stated that the first batch of 240 expelled overseas Chinese arrived in Hong Kong on May 15, and the second batch of overseas Chinese chartered ships to return home. Domestic newspapers also reprinted the report, and people in society were deeply surprised, and those concerned about overseas Chinese affairs were particularly anxious. At that time, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission heard this rumor and, believing that it was strange and absurd, and fearing that the rumor-mongers had ulterior motives, immediately ordered the Consulate General in Batavia to investigate and report the details. Recently, the Consulate General reported that the news report was pure fabrication. The latest news about overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies is summarized as follows: It is true that overseas Chinese residing in the Dutch East Indies have been dismissed, unemployed, or unable to pay taxes due to the impact of the economic downturn in recent years, but the number is small and they were not expelled by the local government. The so-called "wealthy families are given 20 days to return to their country, and the working class is given two weeks to return, otherwise they will be forcibly expelled and their property will be confiscated" is entirely unfounded. The report that newspaper reporters were expelled and returned to their country was also denied by the two newspapers. The Batavia New Daily and the Tian Sheng Daily have also published articles refuting the rumors. The so-called "letters sent to government agencies are confiscated" has been investigated by the local post and telecommunications bureau and the Chinese Affairs Department, and it has been proven to be untrue. Government agencies have been receiving and sending letters to and from the Dutch East Indies as usual for several months without any loss. The so-called increase in special taxes and entry taxes is also entirely false. The entry tax in the Dutch East Indies has been 150 guilders per person since it was increased in 1931, and if there are any future tax increase proposals, our government will certainly argue strongly to abolish them. In terms of education, all Chinese schools in the Dutch East Indies are free to teach Chinese, and Chinese history and geography are also included in the curriculum as usual. However, it is true that students under the age of 18 are not allowed to listen to political speeches. As for the report that students of Jinan University must return to the Dutch East Indies within three years, and will not be allowed to return to the port if they overstay, the Chinese Affairs Department and the Immigration Supervision Department of the Ministry of Justice of the Dutch East Indies have stated that there is no such thing. In summary, all of these points prove that the report in a certain Hong Kong newspaper is divorced from the facts and has no basis. At a time when the country is experiencing many troubles, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no villains who fabricate facts and spread rumors, attempting to provoke discord between China and the Netherlands in order to profit. However, the facts are clear, and if we can discern them, we will not be deceived by them.</p>

<h3>Chen Gongbo Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Whether to Withdraw Resignation Is Still Under Consideration</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, left Nanjing yesterday morning at 11:00 AM on the China National Aviation Corporation's Douglas aircraft "Nanjing" and arrived here at 12:30 PM, landing at Hongqiao Airport. Those who went to welcome him included He Zhuoxian, Director of the Southern Standard Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, and many friends and relatives of Chen Gongbo. After disembarking, Chen went directly to his residence to rest. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Chen Gongbo last night and first asked whether the Minister's request for resignation, which had been resolved by the Executive Yuan to retain him, had been withdrawn. Chen replied that he was still considering it and had not yet made a decision. The reporter then asked if it was true that the Minister would be going to Qingdao to visit President Wang's illness. Chen said that he had no intention of going to Qingdao recently. Finally, the reporter asked when he would return to Nanjing. According to Chen, he would be staying in Shanghai for a few days, and the date of his return to Nanjing had not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Inspecting Cotton Production in the North, Zou Bingwen Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Reports Hebei's Situation Is Good, Shandong Province Is Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>According to the Industry News Agency, Zou Bingwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council's Cotton Control Committee, went to Hebei and Shandong provinces on the 3rd of this month to inspect the disaster situation of cotton production and to investigate the rural loan situation in various places on behalf of the China Agricultural Loan Group. He has now completed his task and returned to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai train at 7:00 AM yesterday. A reporter visited him and, according to Zou, the cotton production in Hebei is still good, but some cotton-growing areas in Shandong Province have been greatly affected by the disaster. The China Agricultural Loan Group, which is wholly composed of ten banks including the Jiaotong, Shanghai, and Jin Cheng banks in this city, has had varying degrees of success in handling loans in the past due to their respective policies. They are now seeking ways to unify their steps to meet the needs of the situation. After a period of research, they will actively proceed, he said.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow, the Rent Reduction Committee of the First Special District Will Petition the Municipal Government; Notice to All Branches to Re-register</h3>
<p>The Rent Reduction Committee of the First Special District resolved at the next meeting to hold a rent reduction movement week from the 25th of this month to the end of the month. The working methods were handed over to the propaganda committee members Yu Yaoqiu, Zheng Dongshan, Zhou Fuzhang, and others to prepare and carry out, and Li Aokui, Chen Jiufeng, Zhang Xianfang, Wang Jingdong, Wang Hesong, and others were publicly elected as representatives to submit a petition to the Shanghai Municipal Government at 9:00 AM on the 16th of this month, requesting the prompt promulgation of rent reduction measures to seek the restoration of the market. After the association notified citizens of the regulations for organizing rent reduction associations, several rent reduction branches have been established in various neighborhoods in recent days. In order to unify the implementation of rent reduction, Luo Zheng, a member of the organizing committee, is actively carrying out organizational work. The original letter notifying the district associations is recorded below: Respectfully, in accordance with the resolution of the Executive Committee of this association, all district branches are to be re-registered to jointly promote rent reduction, awaken landlords, and implement rent reduction universally. We believe that housing is one of the four essential elements of life and is indispensable to mankind. Nowadays, the prices of clothing and food are declining day by day and changing with the social economy, and so is rent. The rent reduction movement in recent years is due to the extreme instability of the social economy. Therefore, our direct work in the rent reduction movement is actually the work of restoring the market. It is appropriate to organize rent reduction associations uniformly to promote the realization of unified rent reduction. Since the establishment of your district association, there have been many affiliated branches, and many rent reduction associations have been in progress but not yet established. Within one week of receiving this letter, please urge the establishment of rent reduction associations in neighborhoods that have not yet been established within a time limit to meet the organizational level, and submit a report for registration first. The details of the establishment and the list of committee members must be recorded for statistics. This matter concerns Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to relieve people's livelihood problems and must be carried out with effort. This is what we hope for. To all district branches of the municipal association of the First Special District and the central district associations of Pudong and Puxi, the Rent Reduction Committee of the First Special District of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>On the Eve of the Opening of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, a List of Central Committee Members in Shanghai; Including Song Qingling and 28 Others</h3>
<p>The Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is only a month or so away. What is the current situation of the Central Committee members in Shanghai? It is thought to be watched by society. According to an investigation by a reporter from the New Sound Agency, and according to the telegram from Yu of the Central Secretariat, the Central Committee members in Shanghai include Song Qingling, Wu Tiecheng, Song Ziwen (who has gone to Beijing), Wang Boqun, He Xiangning (currently at Baima Lake), Li Liejun (currently in Qingdao and will return to Shanghai soon), Xiong Kewu (currently in Hong Kong), Wang Faqin (details unknown), Cheng Qian (currently in Shanghai), Jing Hengyi (details unknown), Kong Xiangxi (has gone to Beijing), Wang Zhengting (currently in Beiping), Zhang Zhiben, Xue Dubi, He Shizhen, Cai Yuanpei (currently in Qingdao), Zhang Renjie (currently in Mogan Mountain), Wu Jingheng, Xie Chi (currently in Hong Kong, one saying has come to Shanghai), Liu Yazi, Yang Hu, Li Fulin (currently in Guangzhou), Pan Lingchao (details unknown), Chen Jiayou (currently in Guangzhou), Li Yuying (has gone to Beijing), Jiang Zuo (currently in Beijing), Zhang Dingfan, Huang Fusheng, and Yang Shukan, totaling 29 people.</p>
<h3>Hankou Suddenly Encountered a Hurricane; China National Aviation Corporation Aircraft Destroyed; Shanghai-Hankou Flight as Usual Today</h3>
<p>At 6:30 PM on the 13th of this month, Hankou suddenly encountered a hurricane, which was very strong. Two No. 2 and No. 4 Loening aircraft and one Stinson aircraft belonging to the China National Aviation Corporation, which were parked at the Taikoo Wharf riverside seaplane airport in Hankou, had their float chains broken by the wind at the time, causing the No. 2 Loening aircraft to collide with No. 4. There was no time to defend, and the wings of both aircraft were destroyed. The Stinson aircraft was then swept into the huge waves by the hurricane, and the force of the wind at the time can be imagined. After the company received a telegram from the Hankou office reporting the disaster, it immediately reported it to the ministry and formulated follow-up measures. In addition to finding ways to salvage the sunken aircraft and transport the Loening aircraft to Shanghai for repairs, a solution has been determined for air transport between Shanghai and Hankou. Westbound and eastbound flights will continue as usual today.</p>
<h3>International Labor Maritime Conference Formally Invites Our Participation; Preparatory Meeting to Be Held on November 25; 24 Maritime Nations Invited</h3>
<p>According to the New Sound Agency, the Governing Body of the International Labor Office will convene a Maritime Conference in the autumn of next year (1936) to discuss various international maritime issues. The International Labor Office has recently formally sent a letter to our government inviting our participation. Prior to next year's conference, a Maritime Preparatory Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva on November 25 of this year. The member states invited to participate this time are the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Norway, Germany, France, Italy. Netherlands, Sweden, Greece, Spain, Denmark, Canada, the Soviet Union, Brazil, Finland, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Argentina, Australia, Panama. Portugal, India. And our country, a total of 24 maritime nations.</p>
<h3>Aviation Industry Should Pay Attention; Avoid Flying Low Near the Tianli Liquefied Gas Plant; Light Gas Easily Catches Fire in the Air When Released</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Tianli Liquefied Gas Products Factory on the north bank of the Suzhou River in this city has been progressing steadily since it started construction, and its work is becoming increasingly intense. Recently, the China Aviation Association received a letter from the factory stating that the company is engaged in the business of manufacturing liquefied gas products using a fixed method of atmospheric liquefaction and has now started work. Although all the light gas generated in the electrolyzers is stored in gas storage tanks, it is sometimes necessary to release the light gas into the air at the beginning of work. This light gas is very easy to catch fire. If aircraft fly at low altitude near the factory, it is possible to cause danger to both parties. In addition to sending special letters to China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, it is requested that your association send letters to relevant agencies to inform their pilots to avoid flying low near the factory to ensure safety. The factory is located on the north bank of the Suzhou River (opposite Bailinan Road), about one mile from the railway. There are four silver gas storage tanks there, which are very easy to identify. The Aviation Association has distributed the letters accordingly. It is also heard that Tianli Factory mainly produces nitric acid and ammonia. Recently, due to the overproduction of hydrochloric acid at the Tianyuan Electrochemistry Factory under the same system, it has started to manufacture sal ammoniac (used as a raw material for dry batteries, etc., which has never been manufactured domestically) to alleviate the situation and meet the needs of domestic goods factories.</p>
<h3>Stamp Tax Law to Be Implemented on Schedule; Chamber of Commerce Issues Special Notice; Tax Law and Implementation Rules Being Printed; Lecture to Be Held on August 24</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stated that the new Stamp Tax Law has been scheduled to be implemented on September 1. In order to clarify matters for the business community, it has decided to hold a lecture on the 24th of this month to explain the comparison between the old and new tax laws, and will open a special column in the No. 8 Commercial Monthly to explain the details. Special notices have been issued to the four branch offices in Wusong, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Nanshi, as well as to various industry associations: Respectfully, the Stamp Tax Law promulgated in December of last year has been ordered to be implemented on September 1. The Stamp Tax Law Implementation Rules have also been formulated by the Ministry of Finance and will be implemented at the same time. These regulations are necessary tools for merchants to check. This association has already printed 20,000 copies each, but the number of members in each association varies, and it is difficult to predict the exact number to be issued. Each association or branch office should determine the number of members or stores in its area, and how many are needed per industry and per area, and collect and distribute them on their behalf. Each set includes one copy of the Stamp Tax Law and one copy of the Implementation Rules, and a fee of two cents in national currency will be charged for the paper and printing costs, which should be paid along with the collection. This association will distribute them in the order of application. If the 20,000 copies have already been distributed at the time of application, or if there are not many copies remaining, the shortage will be made up when the second batch is printed. In addition, because the Stamp Tax Law and the Provisional Regulations have many differences, there may be confusion about the changes, so a special column has been opened in the 8th issue of the 15th volume of the Commercial Monthly to explain the main points. However, it is feared that the readership of that monthly magazine is not widespread enough, so a meeting has been scheduled for 9:00 AM on Saturday, the 24th of this month, to gather representatives from various industries to explain the purpose in person, so as to prepare before implementation and reduce misunderstandings and penalties after implementation. Corresponding letters have been sent. Please investigate and handle accordingly.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Opium Suppression Problem: Director Cai's Broadcast Speech Yesterday; Anti-Smoking Advocacy Team of the Public Safety Bureau Sets Off This Morning to Promote the Cause</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 14th) at 4:30 PM, Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, gave a speech on the "Opium Suppression Problem in Shanghai" at the Sino-Western Drug Store radio station. He said: (1) Dear compatriots, today I, Jinjun, am honored to be invited by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to give this radio speech. I feel very honored to have such a good opportunity to speak to all the compatriots in the city. The topic I am speaking on today is "The Opium Suppression Problem in Shanghai." Before discussing opium suppression, we should understand the harms of opium. Facts tell us that a person addicted to opium is physically weak, economically distressed, and morally bankrupt. Because opium contains morphine, a toxic substance, addicts suffer pathological changes in their physiology. Healthy people become sick, mildly ill people become seriously ill, and seriously ill people become incurable. Therefore, smokers are always thin as rails and mentally depressed. At the same time, as everyone knows, people with opium addictions must smoke every day. Therefore, opium becomes an indispensable necessity. Wealthy people increase this burden, and in a few years, their family property is squandered, turning them into beggars. Poor people's lives become even more difficult. When there is no other way, their last resort is to take risks and commit crimes. This is an inevitable phenomenon caused by the increased burden and economic hardship of opium smokers. Furthermore, opium smokers, no matter how knowledgeable or skilled they may be, are unable to engage in productive work due to their physical and mental state. Coupled with the need to spend money on opium, increasing the burden, these two conditions constitute their immoral behavior. They disregard propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, and they do not know what the law is. I remember that I once interrogated a robber. I asked him why he became a robber. He said, "He was originally a rich man's son and studied at a university for two years. Because of opium smoking, he squandered his family property. Later, relying on the skills he learned at the university, he tried to find a job. However, either his physical and mental strength was insufficient, or people disliked his opium smoking, and he eventually became unemployed. At first, he relied on petty theft to maintain his life. Later, the neighbors found out and took precautions. With no means of livelihood and a hungry stomach, he had no choice but to join a gang of bad people and become a robber." This is a real-life example of the decline of an opium smoker. Also, in the past, the detention center of the Public Safety Bureau had a particularly large number of opium-smoking criminals, which is also clear evidence. From this, we can see that smoking opium is indeed a suicidal and sinful act. Smoking opium is not only a suicidal and sinful act, but also a cause of national decline. Because opium smokers not only poison themselves, but also pass on a weak body, low intelligence, and bad habits to their descendants, trapping them in a situation from which they cannot extricate themselves. Opium smokers are mentally depressed, materially unproductive, and physically weak. Their descendants are not vigorous. Therefore, if a nation has a large proportion of opium smokers, that nation will inevitably decline because it loses its national "strength." Since the Opium War, our nation has been weak and bullied by others. This is the result of the poison of opium. Because the harm opium inflicts on individuals, society, and the nation is so serious, opium suppression is a serious issue. Only opium suppression can reduce social evils, and only opium suppression can revive the Chinese nation. (2) Since the opium suppression problem is so serious, let us now review the achievements of past opium suppression efforts. Since the Opium War, whether under the Manchu Qing government or the Northern Warlord era, opium was banned by law, and opium smoking was a crime punishable by law. However, after many years, many opium offenders have been punished every year, but to this day, there has been no success. Why is this? The reason is that they did not know that the legislation was strict enough, the ban was too short, and the necessary procedures were not taken into account. There were neither strict control measures nor consistent and effective steps, and the general public did not assist the government. Therefore, the problem has continued to worsen day by day and has not yet been eradicated. Our Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has seen through this point, so he has made a great determination to adopt the six-year ban plan decided by the National Assembly in the past, deciding that from this year to the 29th year, as the prohibition period, taking two measures, one is to promote the New Life Movement, to shift the social atmosphere, to encourage the people to assist the government in prohibiting opium, on the one hand, to use scientific methods, with the power of the government, to force smokers to quit. Indeed, the responsibility of society for the ban on opium is greater than the responsibility of the government. Revolution must first reform the heart, political change must first change customs. Changing customs is to shift the atmosphere. To shift the atmosphere, we must rely on the power of society. Although society does not reward opium smokers, it does not punish them either. Opium smokers have been given a kind of forgiveness. Therefore, their numbers have increased considerably day by day. Taking Shanghai as an example, according to the statistics of the Public Safety Bureau on the seizure of opium and potent narcotics, 1,500 offenders were seized in the 21st year, 6,176 offenders were seized in the 22nd year, and 6,956 offenders were seized in the 23rd year. Judging from this, there is no doubt that the number of smokers is increasing year by year. This is clear evidence of the lack of social sanctions. We all know that the custom of foot-binding has a history of seven or eight hundred years, from the Five Dynasties to the present day. Since the founding of the Republic of China, foot-binding has been promoted, and in less than twenty years, the centuries-old custom of foot-binding has been eradicated. Because everyone in society believes that this is the right thing to do, the concept of beauty of small feet has also changed. The general young men will not marry women with bound feet, and the general women with bound feet are in danger of not being able to marry. Therefore, the atmosphere has changed. Women who have already bound their feet immediately unbound them, and women who have not bound their feet dare not bind them anymore. This is the effect of social sanctions. When I was in Jiangxi last year, I went to visit Linchuan County. There is a Pengxi Town Experimental District, which is one of the most vigorous places to promote the New Life Movement, especially for opium suppression. There is a room in the district that is filled with more than a thousand confiscated pipes. It is said that they were voluntarily surrendered by their relatives. The methods they adopted for opium suppression are very clever, organized by the New Life Movement Association. They organized a Women's Life Improvement Association. Banning opium is the most important work of the association. They use the women in the family as supervisors of opium suppression, mothers for sons, wives for husbands, sisters for brothers, etc. If they have an opium addiction, they first persuade them with bitter words. If they cannot be persuaded with words, they follow it with tears. If they cannot be moved by tears, they follow it with estrangement. It should be known that parents, brothers, sisters, and spouses are all kinds of innate feelings. If these feelings are severed, both sides feel pain. Every family is like this, and no one sympathizes with the smoker. Therefore, it is very effective. If they still do not quit, they will implement the second step, that is, the family will sever his economic relations, and relatives and friends will not provide assistance, so that he feels that he has no way to survive without quitting opium. Who does not cherish his reputation, who does not cherish his life? Therefore, in less than a few months in Pengxi Town, all the smokers in the town have completely quit opium under this strict supervision. This is a very good example to learn from. From this, we can know the power of social sanctions. (3) Now let's talk about our Shanghai, the largest city in the country. It has more than three million people. It is the center of China's economy and culture, and it is also a place where Chinese and foreigners live together. The rise and fall of the nation depends on the eyes of both Chinese and foreigners. The urgency of opium suppression is beyond words. Therefore, the Opium Suppression Committee was established on July 1 this year to discuss opium suppression measures and decided to implement them in stages. The first step is to register all smokers. After the registration deadline, we will find out the number of people who smoke opium and the amount of opium paste needed. Based on the statistics, we will limit the number of opium paste stores and gradually reduce them until opium is completely banned. The Public Safety Bureau is ordered to handle the registration of smokers. A public notice was posted on July 22, and at the same time, orders were issued to all sub-bureaus, divisions, and teams to start registering smokers from today. There are already quite a few people who have registered. The purpose of registration is to count the exact number of smokers in order to quit in stages. The registration period is set at six months, from July to the end of September as the automatic registration period. The Bureau organized a persuasion team to persuade smokers to register. From October to the end of December, it is the period of compulsory registration. The Bureau will order the arrested offenders to register. At the same time, the Bureau plans to have three kinds of registration application forms, one is the application form for a general opium quitting license, the second is the application form for a pauper's license, and the third is the application for opium quitting. However, those who apply for a pauper's opium quitting license must submit a letter of guarantee to the Bureau for verification and issuance of a license to prove whether they are paupers. Those who apply to quit opium must also register first in accordance with the regulations and wait to be sent to the opium quitting hospital, and they must also fill out a letter of guarantee guaranteeing that they can be tested at any time after quitting and will never smoke again. In addition, if the smoker travels, he must submit the license he has received to the Bureau for a travel certificate. In short, the procedures should be as simple as possible, and the methods should be as thorough as possible. The Bureau has now established the rules for smokers' registration and the detailed rules for implementing the registration of opium-smoking households within a time limit. All the procedures for application registration, the regulations for penalties, and the handling of opium cases are recorded in it. The police have been sent to distribute them door-to-door. I think everyone has seen them and does not need to explain them in detail. (4) However, opium suppression is a major move to shift the atmosphere and a great plan to revive the nation. Relying on the power of the government alone is not enough. All the smokers in the city must realize it, and all the compatriots in the city must assist us in order to achieve the goal. The reasons for this have been stated before and do not need to be repeated here. Compatriots throughout the city, we must recognize the seriousness of the Shanghai opium suppression problem. We must understand our responsibilities. I hope that the compatriots who are addicted to opium will quickly wake up and come to the Public Safety Bureau to register and ask to quit. I hope that the compatriots who are not addicted to opium will strive to promote the New Life Movement, assist the government in banning opium, and shift the social atmosphere. In particular, I hope that the female compatriots in the city will organize Women's Life Improvement Associations and emulate the methods of Pengxi Town, Linchuan County, Jiangxi, to urge their families to quit opium. I believe that it can be quit within six years. This is the gospel of the citizens and the key to the revival of the nation. (The End)</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, in accordance with the regulations and bylaws of the time-limited opium suppression promulgated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters, is immediately implementing the city's opium suppression movement. The regulations stipulate that the first phase, from July to the end of September of this year, is the deadline for smokers to surrender themselves. The second phase, from October 1 to the end of December, is the deadline for compulsory registration of smokers. After the announcement of the measures, registration will begin immediately. In order to eliminate smokers within a time limit, quit their addiction, and make the public pay attention to the significance of opium suppression, the Municipal Public Safety Bureau has specially ordered all district bureaus and district offices in the city to organize persuasion teams, which have been established. They will set off this morning to take on the work of persuasion and publicity. Song Ziwen, Li Shizeng, and Wang Minyi took the night train from Beijing yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Utilizes the Surplus of the Boxer Indemnity to Add Two River Steamers; Plan Already Finalized</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will utilize the surplus from the British Boxer Indemnity to add Yangtze River ships. It is found that the remaining balance of the funds is 40,000 pounds. Using this sum to build a river steamer would only be sufficient for one ship. Now it is learned that the company has decided that in addition to building a river steamer with the remaining funds, another motor engine upper Yangtze River steamer will be added to run the Hankou-Yichang route. However, the surplus of 40,000 pounds is only enough to purchase the materials for two ships. The cost of the hull and construction equipment is still short of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. It has been decided that the company will raise funds separately.</p>
<p>Revised Ship Design</p>
<p>The design of the new river steamer was originally planned to be built according to the Taikoo Company's Wusong vessel, with a deadweight of 3,426 tons, mainly for cargo loading. The ship is equipped with hooks for loading and unloading large cargo. After several meetings, the previous plan was revised, and it was decided to build it according to the design of the company's Jiang'an and Jiangshun vessels, with a deadweight of 4,327 tons, with both cargo and passenger transportation as the principle. The draft will also be improved so that flood and shallow water can be freely adjusted without hindering navigation. As for the motor boat, it has a deadweight of 500 tons and is mainly used for cargo transportation.</p>
<p>Proceeding with Material Purchases</p>
<p>After several meetings and revisions, the ship design was finalized and submitted to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors and reported to the Ministry of Communications for record. The materials used for the two ships are still being purchased in the UK, transported to Shanghai, and then handed over to the Jiangnan Shipyard for construction. The import of materials for the two ships has been approved by the Central Government for tax exemption. All matters have now been completed, and the purchase of materials from England to China will be carried out immediately.</p>
<h3>Domestic Wireless Telephone: Scheduled Calls Between Shanghai and Guangzhou; Trial Calls to Begin at the End of the Month; Opening on National Day; Wuhan Line Affected by Major Floods; Project Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reported that, in order to facilitate domestic telecommunications, the Ministry of Communications, together with the Guangdong Provincial Authorities, is planning to establish long-distance wireless telephone service between Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan. After the International Telecommunications Bureau was ordered by the Ministry to prepare, it immediately surveyed land near the Zhenru International Radio Station and built the Shanghai General Radio Station for Shanghai-Guangzhou-Wuhan long-distance wireless telephone service. The construction is progressing smoothly and has now been completed. As for the Guangdong Province, after the Director of the Provincial Telephone Administration, Deng Zongyao, came to Shanghai and transported the machinery to Guangdong, he surveyed the Shpai area to build a radio station and equip it with machinery. It can also be completed within a month. According to Wen Yuqing, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, Shanghai and Guangdong will conduct trial calls at the end of this month. If the results are good, it will be officially opened on National Day this year. As for Wuhan, due to the flooding, the construction of the radio station building has been greatly affected, so it will be slightly delayed. Once the water recedes and the project is completed, it will be opened on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Thirteen Overseas Chinese from Vladivostok Repatriated Due to Disabilities; Yesterday, They Boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Ming Vessel; Funds Sent to Their Hometowns in Hebei and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Thirteen overseas Chinese from Vladivostok, including Ma Wenbin and Yang Jinying, are all disabled. Not only can they not work, but they are also old. They were issued passports by the Chinese Consulate in Vladivostok and sent back to China. Previously, the Consulate had telegraphed the Municipal Public Safety Bureau. It is now learned that the overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. After disembarking at the Xinkang Wharf, Wang Guan, a member of the relief section of the First Department of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau, was sent to the port to take care of them and transported them to the Xiaodongmen, where they checked into the Oriental Hotel. It is reported that the thirteen overseas Chinese, including Ma Wenbin, are from Hebei and Tianjin. Therefore, yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., the Public Safety Bureau provided them with some travel expenses and sent Ma and others to board the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xin Ming vessel to be sent back to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Lixin Accounting Firm Writes Loan Application Forms on Behalf of Others; Industrial and Commercial Loan Association Sends Letter of Appreciation Yesterday; Hopes That Other Accountants Will Continue to Fulfill Their Obligations</h3>
<p>Since the Industrial and Commercial Credit Small Loans were announced and started to be made by the Loan Committee, the initial applicants were few, but recently the numbers have been increasing. However, most applicants are not familiar with filling out the required forms and often make mistakes. Therefore, the Loan Committee finds it very inconvenient to accept and review them. It is now learned that the Lixin Accounting Firm, organized by the famous accountant Pan Xulun of this city, is willing to undertake the obligation of providing guidance or filling out the various forms that industrial and commercial enterprises applying for loans should fill out. It has recently sent a letter to the Loan Committee stating its intention. The committee believes that Lixin Accounting Firm is assisting industry and commerce and is enthusiastic about public welfare, which is very admirable. Yesterday, it sent a reply letter of appreciation, informing all applicants who are not familiar with the filling procedures to go and ask for guidance. Lixin Accounting Firm is located at 190 Ningbo Road, which is very close to the Loan Committee. Therefore, the general applicants call it convenient. According to the person in charge of the Loan Association, if other accountants are willing to fulfill this obligation, the Association is also very welcome.</p>

<h3>Since August This Year: Rainfall Exceeds Last Year by One-Third; Total of 713 Millimeters Since the Beginning of the Year; Cotton Will Mature Late, but Early and Late Rice Are Not Affected</h3>
<p>Since August this year, Shanghai has received one-third more rainfall than last year, resulting in excessive growth of cotton seedlings and late maturity. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>August Rainfall</p>
<p>According to the records of the Xujiahui Observatory, from January 1 to August 13 this year, Shanghai has received 713.6 millimeters of rainfall, equivalent to 28.09 inches. The rainfall for the same period last year was 444.7 millimeters, equivalent to 17.51 inches. This year's rainfall is more than one-third higher than last year's.</p>
<p>Late Maturation of Cotton</p>
<p>Excessive rainfall after autumn, coupled with drought before summer, has caused considerable damage to cotton. At first, it could not grow, and then it only grew stems and leaves and did not produce flowers and buds. In the suburbs of Shanghai, Taicang, Kunshan, Baoshan, Qingpu, Songjiang, Fengxian, Nanhui, and other counties, new cotton should have been seen by the middle of the seventh lunar month. However, due to excessive rainfall, it has not yet been seen. There is a saying that "early-growing cotton and late-growing rice," but now that the growth of cotton is like this, the harvest will probably be reduced. However, the early and late rice itself will not be affected.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Forbids British-American Tobacco Company from Growing Tobacco in Xuchang; Because It Violates International Conventions; The Company Has Been Warned to Stop Growing</h3>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to improve domestic flue-cured tobacco, established the Xuchang Tobacco Improvement Committee, specializing in planting and other work, and hired experts to study the soil and guide tobacco planting. The results of the experiments were very good. This year, the yield of flue-cured tobacco in Xudi increased by 15% compared with last year. Unexpectedly, the tobacco-rich area was coveted by foreigners. The British-American Tobacco Company in this city, without the permission of the central government, set up tobacco-growing places in the area without authorization. The Taxation Department found out about this situation and reported it to the Ministry of Finance for verification. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance believes that the company's weighing of tobacco in the area is a violation of international commercial treaties and has warned the company to stop planting.</p>

<h3>Celebrities in the City Hold Tea Party to Welcome Mei Lanfang Yesterday: Mayor Wu and the Russian Ambassador Give Speeches: Mr. Mei Elaborates on His Visit to Russia</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, celebrities from all walks of life in the city held a tea party at the International Hotel on the second floor to welcome Dr. Mei Lanfang, who returned with honors from his European tour. Many guests attended, including Mayor Wu and Russian Ambassador Hu Die. Dr. Mei also reported on his performance during his European tour. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>The guests who attended the tea party yesterday included Mayor Wu, the Russian Ambassador, Dr. Mei, Hu Die, Chen Qicai, Yang Hu, Yu Ming, Yu Shangyuan, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Li Denghui, Wang Boqi, Xu Xinliu, Lin Kanghou, Feng Gengguang, Chen Zheqing, Huang Renzhi, Li Dachao, Zhu Shaoping, Luo Mingyou, Pan Guangjiong, and other Chinese and foreign guests, totaling over 200 people. Mayor Wu presided over the event, and Pan Guangjiong translated.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>During the event, Chairman Mayor Wu stood up and delivered a speech, stating that "We are holding this tea party today to welcome Dr. Mei back to the country. Dr. Mei was invited to perform in the Soviet Union, which is of great significance. I believe that the harmonious relationship between people requires mutual understanding. Dr. Mei's trip to the Soviet Union not only communicated art but also promoted diplomatic relations, which is of profound significance. Therefore, from the perspective of our country, the gains are very large. On the one hand, it can make the Soviet people have a deeper understanding of our country, and at the same time, it can promote cultural cooperation and closer diplomatic relations between the two sides. This is all due to Mr. Mei's efforts. Dr. Mei has been exposed to European culture, and he must have benefited a lot personally. In the future, Chinese art will rely on Mr. Mei to promote and carry it forward. We have specially set up this meeting to express our gratitude, and we are honored to have the Russian Ambassador and guests participating. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Russian authorities for their hospitality and ask the Russian Ambassador to convey our gratitude to your country." After the speech, Pan Guangjiong translated it into English.</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador's Speech</p>
<p>The Russian Ambassador then gave a speech, stating that "I am very honored to participate in this grand banquet today. I met Dr. Mei and Ms. Hu Die in Moscow and appreciated Chinese drama. I introduced Dr. Mei to the art circles of our country, who expressed their admiration for the greatness of Chinese opera. I believe that the goodwill between the two countries should be based on cultural ties. Mr. Mei's trip has been very effective. The advancement of new culture should be based on old knowledge. Therefore, the people of our country express their unlimited welcome to Mr. Mei's trip. We also hope that Mr. Mei will bring Russian culture to exchange with us. At this time of cultural movement, its importance is as serious as political issues and economic issues, and its methods can be divided into (1) integrating and studying the cultures of various countries with our own culture to seek integration and development, (2) maintaining our own culture and carrying out unilateral promotion. I think the former is more appropriate, so Mr. Mei's exchange of your country's culture to us is enough to arouse the interest of our people, promote international understanding, and increase human happiness." After the speech, Pan Guangjiong translated it into Chinese.</p>
<p>Wang's Speech</p>
<p>At the invitation of Chairman Wu, Wang Xiaolai stood up and gave a speech, stating, "The previous welcome and farewell parties were all about bringing things back from foreign investigations and research, creating an import surplus. Mr. Mei's trip is a special case, taking things out, so I feel very honored. Chinese culture originated very early and is inevitably outdated, but past achievements cannot be obliterated. Mr. Mei's welcome in the Soviet Union shows that our country's status is still preserved. After returning, I hope Mr. Mei will help to revitalize the opera to help the disaster victims, and I hope to continue to work hard to improve our Chinese opera."</p>
<p>Mayor's Introduction</p>
<p>Mayor Wu then stood up and introduced Dr. Mei's speech, saying that "Mr. Mei returned to Europe early because he saw that the domestic flood situation was serious and could not be ignored. He specifically planned to perform charity performances to help the disaster. All our citizens should not only support the progress but also try to raise funds. In the Yangtze River Basin, among the 290 counties in Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces, 150 counties have been affected by the disaster, and the flood is even worse than in the 20th year of the Republic of China. Although Shanghai is temporarily safe, it will inevitably be affected in the future. Everything must be calculated on a large scale and not rejected for small profits. Shanghai is like a fish, and other places are like water. If the water dries up, the fish will die. Only when business develops can the market prosper. I hope that everyone will immediately rescue the disaster victims."</p>
<p>Mei's Speech</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang then stood up and said, "In February of this year, Lanfang was hired by the Soviet Cultural Association to bring our troupe to perform in Russia. After finishing, I also traveled to Europe with Mr. Yu Shangyuan. When I set off, Mayor Wu and other gentlemen bid farewell to Lanfang here. Now, I am honored by the grand deception of the gentlemen, and Mayor Wu and others have praised Lanfang so much, which makes Lanfang very ashamed and grateful. Recalling that when the Soviet government formally invited Lanfang last year, I was quite suspicious and even panicked, because the Soviet Union is the most developed country in the world in terms of drama. Can Chinese opera be shown to others? Is there any value in studying it? It always felt like a question. Later, because the government and Ambassador Yan and the public of the Shanghai Drama Advancement Association all believed that it was a great intention of the Soviet government and that it had something to do with the culture and diplomacy of the two countries, they were all very enthusiastic. Therefore, Lanfang also gained a lot of courage. Before making a decision, Lanfang also talked to Ambassador Bao several times. Ambassador Bao also believed that Chinese opera has many characteristics and can be introduced to the Soviet Union. Moreover, Ambassador Bao said that the Soviet people wanted to study Chinese drama very much and were very sincere and hoped I would go. So Lanfang thought that I could not live up to their kindness, so I decided to take the risk to go. Lanfang departed from Shanghai on February 21st. The weather along the way was not very cold. I arrived in Moscow on February 12th. After resting in Moscow for a few days, I went on stage to perform. On the opening day, the Soviet government asked Ambassador Yan to give a public speech to the people on stage, and Mr. Arosif, the president of the Cultural Association, introduced me on stage. These are all very memorable. We performed in Russia, and every day the audience was very crowded for eight days. Later, because many people had not heard it yet, the Cultural Association came to me to discuss and repeatedly asked me to sing for a few more days. I agreed at the time, so I continued to perform for seven days, for a total of fifteen days. During the performance, the Soviet people expressed a very enthusiastic attitude towards us. I heard that TASS and the Central News Agency sent many telegrams, and the domestic newspapers published them in detail. I won't say much now. What is more important is that those famous Soviet playwrights and writers published in major newspapers have many comments on Chinese opera. They discovered many advantages in Chinese opera. Now I will simply say a few words about what they said. They said that the biggest advantage of Chinese opera can be roughly divided into three points: First, Chinese opera contains singing, dialogue, dancing, and martial arts. It is a comprehensive art. They all think this is a feature of Chinese opera. The second is that Chinese opera is most in line with the principle of stage economy. For example, to represent a boat in Chinese opera, you only need to use a paddle to represent a boat, and you can make many, many postures on the water. If you really want to get a real boat, I'm afraid it won't be so convenient, and the impression gained in the eyes of the audience is the same boat, but on the stage, the difference between "economy" and "non-economy" is distinguished. So this point is also what they think is very long. The third point is that Chinese actors' training is very profound. One day, we held a research meeting at the Drama Association. We showed them the various stages and various skill trainings that Chinese actors have gone through during the period of learning opera. So they all know that in Chinese opera, every actor has to go through six or seven years of training before they can go on stage. Every move on the stage, such as stage steps and posture, is very strict and has a certain current law. It is called having a place and a size, and it cannot be ambiguous at all, but a kind of vigorous application is all in the actor's talent. These points are all praised by them. Mr. Meyerhold, the most famous playwright in the Soviet Union, said that he will also adopt this method of Chinese opera to compile and perform their plays in the future, and said that it can be realized soon. There is also Mr. Eisenstein, a world-famous film director, who also said that the method of Chinese opera can be used in films. Although they said that, Lanfang is still not confident about how Chinese opera is. If these two people's remarks can be seen in reality, then there may be a little influence on the culture of the two countries. I have briefly reported on the situation of performing opera in Russia. As for their comments on Chinese opera, there are many in the newspapers, and it is impossible to finish them all at once. I plan to translate it in the future and use it as our reference. As for Lanfang, I am very grateful for their kind hospitality in the Soviet Union this time. In advance, their government organized a reception committee to publicize to the people. When we set off, we took a special ship sent by the Soviet Union, and there were party representatives traveling with us to take care of us along the way. After arriving in Vladivostok, the Cultural Association sent representatives to welcome us again. When we arrived in Moscow, the people expressed their welcome, which shows a friendly expression between the governments and people of the two countries. Therefore, Lanfang is grateful to Ambassador Bao, the representative of the Soviet Union, today. After Lanfang performed in Russia, he went to Central Europe to travel. Because the time was very short, it was just a quick glance. I saw about seventy or eighty plays. In short, the dramas of various countries have their own styles and cannot be generalized. As for me, I stayed in Russia for a relatively long time. Russia is originally the most distant country in the world in terms of drama. Since the revolution, their government has used all its energy to create new dramas, but at the same time, for their old drama culture, they still preserve it in the old way. The temperament of the Russian people is very determined, and they are willing to work hard on everything. They are also like this for drama. Just say that there are more than 70 theaters in Moscow alone, and there are more than 200 drama schools in the country, with more than 29,000 students. With such efforts, I think there will definitely be new gains and great success in the future. The spirit of the Russian people's brave advance is really admirable. As for the other construction situation, we don't need to say much. Just looking at this point of drama, we can imagine it. After Lanfang went to Europe this time, looking at other people's operas and thinking about my own operas, I think that if China can go through strict selection and new improvements, it will definitely have a higher status in the future. However, this responsibility is very great, and it is by no means what Lanfang alone or the strength of our drama circles can do. I still hope that all the enthusiastic gentlemen in the society who love drama will come together to sort it out, so that our Chinese drama may have a more developed day. Regarding the experience of going abroad this time and the detailed situation of the European drama circles, Lanfang plans to write it out in the future and ask the gentlemen for advice. Today, I can only say a few words. If there is anything that is not enough, I have to ask the gentlemen to forgive me. Today, I thank you all for your kindness. Lanfang still has one thing to ask of you all. Lanfang heard on the way back to the country that the disaster situation in various provinces was extremely serious, and I was very anxious. When I returned to Shanghai, I heard that Mr. Xu Junren, Mr. Wang Yishi, and Mr. Du Yuesheng told me about the flood situation, which was very tragic. Lanfang volunteered to perform charity performances for a relatively long time to do my best. Mr. Xu, Wang, and Du all agreed and promised that the charity association would quickly organize it. It can be performed on stage after it cools down in autumn. However, Lanfang is weak, the disaster situation is extremely serious, and the market is not good. Therefore, it is necessary to ask all the gentlemen for help. If you can save more money, the disaster victims can get more benefits. Lanfang will be very grateful."</p>
<p>Hu Die's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, the chairman introduced Ms. Hu Die's speech, saying that Chinese drama is different from foreign drama, especially movies. Ms. Hu is engaged in movies, and she must have benefited a lot from her trip to Russia. Ms. Hu then stood up and briefly said, "I have successively reported the detailed experience of this European tour. Now I will briefly describe my feelings as follows: The Soviet Union and European countries all use movies as a tool for education and propaganda, dividing them into categories and projecting them on the screen. The interest is good and the effect is great. I hope that our country will immediately follow suit to seek development. At the same time, I am very grateful for the hospitality and welcome from the authorities, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Bao and ask you to convey my humble opinion to your country. In addition, I also hope that everyone present will give me guidance from time to time to correct my shortcomings."</p>
<p>Following the Welcome to Mei</p>
<p>The tea party ended at 6 PM. It is reported that Russian Ambassador Bogomolov will host a dinner at the Russian Embassy at 8:30 PM today to entertain Dr. Mei and invite celebrities from all walks of life in the city to accompany him. At 5 PM on the 23rd of this month, Mrs. Freitz of the International Drama Society of Shanghai will hold a tea party at Sassoon Villa at 4391 Hongqiao Road to welcome Dr. Mei. In addition, playwright Yu Shangyuan was originally scheduled to return to the north a few days ago, but due to entertainment and private affairs, the trip was delayed. It is said that he will leave Shanghai after the 23rd.</p>

<h3>North German Second New Ship "Bosten" Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow: Open to Public Viewing on the 17th and 18th: Minister Cheng Buys Tickets But There Are No Seats</h3>
<p>The second Sino-German Express ship "Bosten" of the North German Company, managed by the German Meizuishi Foreign Firm, is coming to Shanghai from Germany for the first time. It has already sailed from Hong Kong yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. It will be open to public viewing from the 17th. I will repeat the following:</p>
<p>Late Arrival</p>
<p>The second new ship "Bosten" of the North German Company set sail from Hengbao on July 5th and was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 6th of this month. Later, because the ship's parts were damaged en route, the repair was delayed, delaying the trip by ten days. It was not until yesterday that the ship sent a telegram to Shanghai, stating that it would leave Hong Kong on the 14th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at noon on the 16th. Because the ship was late, the sailing schedule to Japan was changed to the 19th, and the sailing schedule to Europe from Shanghai was changed to September 1st for export.</p>
<p>Import</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Meizuishi Foreign Firm had already prepared a pilot to lead the "Bosten" into port when it arrived outside the Tongsha beach at the mouth of Wusong. This time, it still needs to be open to the public for viewing, so the ship is still moored at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou as usual. Yesterday, the firm had already sent out invitations, and the viewing period is on the 17th and 18th. There are a total of fifty passengers coming to Shanghai on this ship, and others to various ports are also full. There are many goods.</p>
<p>Crowded with Passengers</p>
<p>The "Bosten" is a thousand tons smaller than the "Xiangshiswan" ship. The format layout and equipment of the ship are the same as those of the "Xianghuosituo" ship. It is also powered by electricity. It is the most modern in the Far East. There are a total of two hundred and ninety-four first and second class rooms. It only takes twenty-three days to go to Europe from Shanghai, so the tickets were sold out a month ago. This time, Cheng Tianfang, the newly appointed Chinese minister to Germany, and his entourage of more than ten people went to the firm to buy tickets to take office in Germany. However, the cabins had already been reserved, and there was no way to comply. The firm was very uneasy about Minister Cheng.</p>
<h3>Three National Telephone Experts Exchange Opinions Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dagongshe reported that the Board of Directors of the Public Concession Bureau, in order to solve the problem of the telephone in the defense zone, hired telephone experts from four countries to form a Telephone Expert Committee. Since the British member Brown, the Japanese member Inada, and our Chinese member Hu Ruixiang arrived in Shanghai one after another, they met once the day before yesterday and held an informal discussion in the council hall of the Public Concession Bureau to discuss the work items of the expert committee. Director-General Fei Xindun and Deputy Director-General Fei Lipu both met with the three experts and gave a detailed account of the general situation of the telephone in the special zone in the past. Yesterday noon, the three national experts gathered for a meal at the Shanghai Club on the Bund, during which they held another informal meeting to exchange opinions on jointly conducting research and investigation work. They dispersed at 2 PM.</p>

<h3>China Aviation Corporation – Newspaper Delivery Contract Tender - Public Bidding on the 20th of this Month</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the slow delivery time for newspapers has been a common complaint. With the increasing development of private aviation, using airplanes to transport newspapers would greatly benefit those in other cities, allowing them to read Shanghai newspapers in the fastest way possible. The China Aviation Corporation’s Shanghai-Beiping (Beijing), Shanghai-Guangdong, and Yangtze River routes have recently been approved by the Ministry of Transportation to invite bids for a delivery contract, ensuring the prompt transport of newspapers from this city. According to Mr. Huang Zixian of the company, this contract invitation will be managed by merchants in terms of distribution. Out-of-town customers can subscribe directly through them. The delivery method will be by the company's airplanes. The deadline for registration is set for the 19th, and the public bidding will be held at 10:00 AM on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Morning - High Tide Exceeded Forecast - 12 Feet 1 Inch, Half a Foot Higher than Predicted - Yangtze River Water Level Gradually Decreasing, Night Navigation Resumed</h3>
<p>The high tide that occurred in this city at 0:05 AM yesterday was higher than the predicted 11 feet 5 inches 6 points. According to the Shuipu (River Dredging) Bureau's water level marker, it reached 12 feet 1 inch, one minute earlier than the predicted time of 0:06 AM. This means it was 5 inches 4 points higher than predicted. Therefore, when the tide was rising rapidly, the water flow in the Huangpu River was turbulent and quite dangerous. Some ditches on the lower roads had water gushing out of the pipes due to the water flow.</p>
<p>Warehouses Unaffected - However, the height of the embankment along the north side of the Jianghai Customs Wharf is above 13 feet, so there was still a difference of nine inches (eight inches six points). Recently, various companies and banks have already intensified their protection of warehouses, so there was no impact.</p>
<p>Night Navigation Resumed - Furthermore, the Jianghai Customs forwarded Jianghan Customs River Patrol Commissioner's Yangtze River Downstream Shipping Notice No. 2510: "Previously, due to the Yangtze River flooding, both banks were submerged. For the sake of navigation safety, this office issued Yangtze River Downstream Shipping Notice No. 2494, prohibiting ships from navigating at night. Now, it has been found that the water level is gradually decreasing, and the ban is no longer necessary. The ban will be lifted when the Wuhan (Hankou) water level drops to 13.106 meters (43.0 English feet). This notice has been submitted to the Customs Commissioners of various ports downstream for approval and record. Therefore, this notice is issued to all shipping merchants for their information. Commissioner Bai Lieshi."</p>
<h3>Ye Yongbiao Sentenced for Extortion - Three Years and Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Ye Yongbiao (also known as Ye Yonglin), whose address is House No. 15, Lane 668, Yuyuan Road, who took instructions from the manager of Zhengda Bank to report to Bo Sheng, and who last month colluded with bandits and used the name of the "Blood Soul Eliminate Traitors Group" to send three threatening letters, intending to extort 50,000 yuan, was arrested by the Jing'an Temple Police. He was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and confessed clearly. The circumstances of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui of the Criminal Division VIII announced the verdict, sentencing Ye Yongbiao to two years and six months of imprisonment for jointly using threats to make others hand over their possessions. An electric light switch was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Carpenter Sues Doctor - For Unilaterally Amputating a Hand - But the Hospital Has a Signature from the Carpenter - Trial Opened Yesterday, Court Still Needs to Investigate</h3>
<p>Lu Mingyao, a 28-year-old native of Jiangdu and graduate of Tongde Medical School, recently opened Tongji Hospital at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Dagu Road, but did not obtain a license from the Municipal Health Bureau to practice medicine. He is now being sued by Shen Yuji, a carpenter from Taixing residing at No. 41, Diandang Lane, Dadongmen, Nanshi, through lawyer Zhang Deyou, for negligent injury. A civil suit is also attached, seeking compensation of 11,140 yuan. Shen developed a blood tumor on his right wrist in March of this year.</p>
<p>Which Greatly Hindered His Work</p>
<p>Introduced by a friend, Ding Wenqing, he went to Lu's clinic for treatment on July 11. They agreed on a consultation fee of 30 yuan. Lu then used a knife to cut off the tumor, accidentally damaging a blood vessel, causing uncontrollable bleeding. Seeing that there was no way to save it, Lu sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment without Shen's consent, and Lu unilaterally had Shen's right hand amputated. At the time, Shen was in a coma due to excessive blood loss. When he woke up, he discovered that his hand had been amputated. But Shen's family relied entirely on Shen's work for sustenance. Now that his</p>
<p>Hand Has Been Amputated</p>
<p>He cannot work. Therefore, he is suing him under Article 284 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court opened the Criminal Division II for questioning. According to Shen Yuji, he explained the previous situation, and said, "At that time, Lu claimed that after treatment, I would be able to work as usual in a little over a month. Who knew that after the operation, the bleeding would not stop, and the pain was extreme, and I fell into a coma. Lu then said that the hospital's equipment was incomplete, and sent me to Renji Hospital by car, without my consent, and had my hand amputated.</p>
<p>That Is Why I Am Suing"</p>
<p>etc. In response, Lu Mingyao stated that the plaintiff was introduced by Ding Wenqing and came to the clinic for treatment. At that time, I said that this hand could not be cured unless it was amputated. However, the plaintiff repeatedly begged me to try to save the hand and find a way to treat it. I then cut off the tumor and saw that the bone had turned black and was completely rotten. If it was not amputated, it would endanger his life. After I persuaded him, the plaintiff also agreed, so I sent him to Renji Hospital by car, where Dr. Lai performed the surgery to amputate it. At that time, the plaintiff</p>
<p>Signed in Person</p>
<p>And hired lawyer Wang Shouan to defend him and filed a counterclaim, accusing Shen of obstructing his reputation, threatening, etc. Judge Huang then stated that the court had already investigated with Renji Hospital, and the hospital replied that the plaintiff and a guarantor, Zhang Guoxiang, had both signed before the hand was amputated. He then asked Shen Yuji about this, but Shen completely denied it, saying that he was already in a coma at the time, how could he have signed? The court considered that the case still needed to be investigated and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fraudster - Commits Suicide in Hangzhou West Lake</h3>
<p>According to the Daily News yesterday, on July 11 of this year, Asatani Toshio and Fujii Yoneichi arrived in Shanghai from Nagasaki and stayed at the Hiroshima Hotel on Wusong Road. Asatani falsely claimed to be proficient in automobile manufacturing and to have been running a car dealership in the South Seas for many years. He also claimed to have eight cars in Shanghai and defrauded various parties. Fujii, who was with him, borrowed 150 yuan from him. On July 22, he suddenly disappeared. Unexpectedly, he had gone to Hangzhou and stayed at the Wenhu Hotel in Geling, West Lake, living lavishly. He also used fraudulent means, falsely claiming to be running a car business in Shanghai and using the alias Chen Songji from Taiwan. Eventually, his evil deeds caught up with him, and he committed suicide by taking poison. The Japanese Consulate General in this city has received the investigation details from the Consulate in Hangzhou. The owner of the Hiroshima Hotel also received a suicide note from the perpetrator. According to Mr. Yamashita Tokuichi, the owner of the hotel, Asatani was from Hyogo Prefecture and was fluent in Chinese.</p>
<h3>Child Addicted to Opium - Abandoned by the Roadside, Gasping for Breath, on the Verge of Death - Revived Only After Drinking Medicated Water</h3>
<p>Zhou Caifu of Ningbo, at around 8:00 AM on the 11th of this month, was walking past the entrance of Lane 180, Rue Wagner in the French Concession, when he noticed a male child, about two years old, lying on the ground, gasping for breath, on the verge of death, seemingly abandoned. He immediately reported it to the Qianshan Road Police Station, and Detective Chen Yulin was dispatched to investigate. The child was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment and reported back to the police chief. After examination by a doctor, it was determined that the child was not ill, but was addicted to opium. Due to the withdrawal symptoms, he was mentally exhausted. After giving him opium substitute medicine, the child gradually woke up and returned to normal, crying and laughing as usual. However, he could not speak clearly and could not tell his name, address, or the reason why he was abandoned. The hospital notified the police station, and after investigation by Detective Chen in various places, it was learned that the child was the son of Yang Heshang, who was engaged in the manufacture of red pills. Last November, he was arrested by the Public Concession Police for manufacturing red pills and sent to the First Special District Court, where he was sentenced to one year in prison. Yang's wife was addicted to opium and red pills, which was passed on to the child. She had to give the child opium every day to satisfy his addiction, otherwise he would cry and make noise incessantly. Recently, Yang's wife suddenly disappeared, and there was no one to take care of the child. It is unknown how he was abandoned on the roadside. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, the police station ordered Detective Chen to take the child to the Criminal Division VIII of the Second Special District Court for instructions. Lawyer Yao of the Police Affairs Department explained the previous situation. After Judge Sun Pengxian questioned Detective Chen Yulin about the investigation, he ordered the bailiff to take the child to the orphanage to be raised. However, when the child was brought to the court, the detective feared that he would experience withdrawal symptoms and be mentally exhausted, so he prepared a small cup of opium water for him to drink. Otherwise, if the child was not given opium water after two hours, his mind would immediately fall into a state of coma. This is indeed an interesting event in the addiction scene.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Pawnshop - Gunshot Murder of Shop Assistant - Conclusion of Interrogation - Awaiting Scheduled Verdict</h3>
<p>Wang Xiangxun, a Chaozhou native and shop assistant at the Jixing Pawnshop at No. 640, Haining Road, was shot in the head and killed by robbers at 9:55 PM on the 28th of last month. After investigation by Chinese Detectives Jin Haibo, Wang Guangqi, and Hu Guangrong of the Hongkou Police Station, Wu Zhenrong from Zhenjiang, Chen Zhengmao from Shaoxing, and Wu Agou from Suzhou were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in this newspaper many times. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division III. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Bureau of Public Works stated that before the incident, the group gathered in Room 28 of the Huzhou Hotel at No. 4, Lane 19, North Shanxi Road. At that time, Wu Zhenrong was carrying a handgun and went to Haining Road, first intending to rob the Dada Pawnshop. Seeing that there was no screen to block the view, he feared that pedestrians on the road would notice, so he changed his plan and robbed the Jixing Pawnshop, resulting in this tragedy. The handgun was made in France, with the number 205, and had a total of five bullets. After the incident, it was hidden at the residence of Wu's sister at No. 1, Lujia Ferry, Pudong, and has been recovered. There were four bullets inside, one of which was the bullet that entered Wang Xiangxun's brain, etc. He then presented the handgun for inspection and requested investigation. Wu Zhenrong confessed that he bought the handgun from a friend surnamed Yang for 40 yuan. He initially asked the deceased for help, but the deceased shouted loudly, so he had to shoot him. Chen Zhengmao confessed that he had previously been imprisoned for seven years for robbery. He met Wu Zhenrong in prison, who invited him to rob together, and he acted as a lookout outside. Wu Agou confessed that he stayed at the Tongshang and Huzhou hotels with Wu Zhenrong before the incident. At that time, they were penniless, had no money for dinner, and were hungry. They went together under the pretext of pawning clothes, grabbed the deceased's hand, forced him to hand over silver dollars, but failed. Wu then fired the gun, and he took the opportunity to escape, which was the truth. Judge Xiao Fen concluded that they should be returned to custody and scheduled a verdict.</p>
<h3>French Concession - Busts Illegal Smelting of Inferior Silver Coins - Manufacturing Silver Ingots for Sale - More Than 20 Male and Female Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>In recent days, the French Police have received numerous confidential reports stating that a large number of lawless elements in the concession have established a large-scale illegal smelting organization to smelt inferior silver coins and mix them into the market, harming countless people. The method they use is to first send out accomplices to buy inferior silver coins at low prices from small money shops and cigarette paper exchange shops. After smelting them, they are made into various silver ingots and sold privately in large quantities or transported to other ports, which affects the financial situation of this city. After receiving the report, the police authorities immediately ordered their subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation. It was not until around 2:00 AM yesterday that they discovered that the main organizational center was secretly located in the house at No. 117, Rue de la Paille. The police chief immediately dispatched a large number of detectives in disguise to surround and arrest them. They seized tens of thousands of yuan worth of inferior silver on the spot and arrested more than 20 male and female key criminals. However, the main culprit has not yet been arrested, and the police are continuing to search for him.</p>
<h3>China-France Pharmacy Donates Profits to Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Disaster Relief in Various Provinces received a letter from the China-France Pharmacy on August 9, which stated: "Dear Sirs, Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been continuous rain, mountain torrents, and outbreaks of disasters in the Yangtze, Huai, and Yellow Rivers. The severity of the damage is even worse than the flood of 20 years ago, and relief is urgently needed. Although our pharmacy is weak and has limited capabilities, we dare not lag behind others in our desire to do good. We have decided to hold a one-month profit-sharing disaster relief campaign starting on the 10th of this month to promote this cause. Although we know that a cup of water cannot save a cartload of burning fuel, there are many shops in Shanghai, and if they can gradually implement this, the amount will be considerable and will be of some help. In addition to reporting the total amount raised after one month, we are sending this letter in advance for your information." From this, we can see the pharmacy's enthusiasm for relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Guanshengyuan - New Factory Invites Industry Peers to Visit</h3>
<p>The new Guanshengyuan factory in Caohejing has been completed for several months. The internal departments have been gradually arranged, and the new biscuit-making and other machines imported from Germany were assembled a month ago. A commencement ceremony was held to start manufacturing. The quality of manufacturing is based on scientific management and mass production, so the quality is excellent and the price is low. Mr. Xian Guansheng, the general manager of the company, invited more than 80 industry peers to visit the factory yesterday, personally guiding them to visit each department and humbly seeking criticism for the sake of mutual research and exchange. All the peers agreed that the completion of the factory was no less than adding a strong force to the Chinese food industry. They also unanimously praised the factory's reasonable management and excellent products. After the visit, the company hosted a banquet at the Nongchang Green Shade Cottage. Wine cups and chopsticks were exchanged, and dishes were in disarray. During the banquet, representatives from various industry peers stood up to give speeches and conducted concrete and practical discussions on the future direction of the biscuit and confectionery industry. At around 4:00 PM, gifts were given, photos were taken, and they returned to Shanghai by car.</p>
<h3>Banking Association - Publication of the Banking Practice Series - Compiled by Zhou Yangwen</h3>
<p>In order to impart practical banking knowledge to those aspiring to study banking, the Banking Association has commissioned senior bank employees with knowledge and experience to write various banking books, named the Banking Practice Series. "Domestic Remittance and Negotiation Business" (內匯兌及押匯業務), one of the books in the series, was published by the Commercial Press a few days ago. This book was written by Mr. Zhou Yangwen, who has 20 years of banking experience and is currently the Assistant Manager and Director of the Real Estate Department of the New China Trust and Savings Bank. It consists of 10 series, 240 pages thick, and a total of 200,000 words. It covers all the procedures, forms, and documents for domestic remittance and negotiation business, and is particularly detailed in the transfer of funds between branches. Only those with rich experience can achieve this, so it is of value to the managers of bank branches. It is said that the book was reviewed by Gu Jigao (Manager of Zhongfu Bank), Yang Jiemei (Deputy Manager of Shanghai Bank), Zhang Naiqi (Deputy Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank), Liu Gongyun (Deputy Director of the Trust Bureau of the Central Bank), and Wang Zhixin (General Manager of Xinhua Bank) before being published by the Commercial Press. It is a very valuable work in recent times.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Bank Inspection Reports</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Reserve of the Four Banks issued a preparation report stating that the Four Banks Reserve is jointly established by the Yanye (Salt Industry), Jin Cheng, Zhongnan, and Continental Banks to exclusively handle the issuance of banknotes from the Zhongnan Bank. According to the reserve's issuance regulations, banknotes are issued with full reserve, with a cash reserve of at least 60% and a guarantee reserve of up to 40%.

<h3>Yesterday’s Peace Association Announcement</h3>
<p>In view of the escalating tensions between Italy and Abyssinia (Ethiopia), the Shanghai World Peace Association specifically sent a telegram to the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday, asking him to agree to the world's permanent peace. The original telegram reads: "Regarding your country's issue with Abyssinia, we hope for a humane and just resolution. You, sir, are a great political figure admired by all. By taking the lead in upholding the League of Nations and extending the credibility of the covenant, your country's honor and your esteemed name will be celebrated throughout the universe. Our association, comprising Chinese peace advocates and global comrades, intends to convene an international conference in the autumn, inviting the great sage Master Duan to expound the true meaning of Datong (Great Harmony). The goal is to seek permanent world peace. We trust that you, sir, will sympathize with this cause. Sun Xiangzhonghan, Shanghai World Peace Conference."</p>
<h3>Notes on Trade Association Announcements</h3>
<p>Since the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association dispatched Zhou Bangjun, Xu Xiaochu, Yuan Hesong, Zhou Mengbai, Tu Kunhua, Sun Choucheng, and others to Beijing twice to negotiate the revised registration method for patent medicines, Director Liu of the Ministry of Health verbally agreed and instructed them to prepare an official document for formalization. It is now known that the official document has been sent out, with the following general content: "Submitting a request for a revised registration method for patent medicines in order to comply with regulations. Upon investigation, the subordinate association has previously sent representatives to personally explain the business difficulties and request that the registration method for patent medicines be revised. We were honored to have received your approval and instructions to prepare an official request, reflecting your concern for business difficulties. We are extremely grateful. The points that we propose to be revised are listed as follows: (1) Upon investigation, the pharmacies have produced many kinds of patent medicines over the years, ranging from hundreds to dozens. If they are all required to be registered at once, it will be difficult in terms of time and economy. It is requested that special flexibility be given, extending the deadline and appropriately reducing fees. (2) During the registration period, it is feared that the provinces and cities will not understand the central government's intentions. If the patent medicines sold in the market, which are not produced locally but are being sold on behalf, are also required to be registered, there will be many obstacles. It is requested that when notifying the provincial and municipal governments, it be clearly stated that registration is limited to the place of production only, in order to avoid misunderstandings. (3) (Omitted) (4) Registering hundreds of patent medicines at the same time requires a large amount of advance payment of fees. It is requested that only the certificate fee and stamp tax be paid first. All inspection fees, after deducting the originally determined amount, will be paid upon receiving the license, which would make the burden lighter and easier to comply with."</p>
<p>The Glass Industry Association held its 24th joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members yesterday. Wang Rongkun was elected as chairman, and Wu Zhen was the recorder. The important cases resolved are listed below: (1) Committee member Wang Songyuan and others suggested that due to the recent sharp drop in the Shanghai exchange rate, the four-number Chinese-made glass sheets sold at six yuan per box at the settlement market price are resulting in losses. How should the price be raised to maintain profitability? Please decide on a resolution. Resolution: Li Songfang, Zhuang Jusheng, Chai Wenjing, and Lu Gengchen were appointed as four committee members to calculate. They responded that the price should be calculated according to the current market exchange rate. It is proposed to increase the price of four-number Chinese-made glass sheets by 6 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen per box. Notice to all members to comply. (Remaining cases omitted).</p>
<h3>A Collection of News on the National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai South National Goods Mobile Market is a joint organization of various manufacturers, with an office located at No. 1 Deli, Old North Gate, Jiucang Street. It is reported that manufacturers have been actively participating in recent days. Originally scheduled to open this month, manufacturers who have already participated in national goods fairs in various places have sent letters to the office, stating that the date is too rushed and they cannot arrive in time, requesting a postponement to the 1st of the next month for the opening. It is said that the office has yielded to public opinion and will issue another notice soon, informing the manufacturers who have already joined the market.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Third National Goods Movement Fair, which opened on the 12th of last month, has seen crowds of gentry and ladies from the Caobao Road area visiting and purchasing domestic products every day. This shows that the general public's concept of happily using national goods is vastly different from the past. It is reported that the fair closed on the 13th of this month, and the sales performance of the products promoted by the participating manufacturers was very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Qingpu County National Goods Exhibition, organized by the Qingpu County Chinese National Goods Promotion Group, is fully prepared and scheduled to open on August 20th, lasting for three weeks. Manufacturers from all industries in this city (seeing that business has gradually improved recently by participating in the national goods promotion movement, they all want to promote it further abroad to expand sales, but they lack opportunities. Since hearing about the Qingpu County National Goods Exhibition organized by the Chinese National Goods Promotion Group, they have been very pleased. Those who have come to the group's office to register for participation have been extremely enthusiastic, and the registration for various industries is about to be full. It is reported that the registration period is scheduled to end on the 16th. It is also known that Qingpu County will have a temple fair on August 24th, 25th, and 26th, and many men and women from the countryside will go to the city to pray. This National Goods Exhibition coincides with this period, and it is expected that the sales performance of national goods will be exceptionally successful.</p>
<p>The Wuxian Shanghai National Goods Promotion Association announced yesterday the simple regulations for manufacturers participating in the Wuxian National Goods Movement Exhibition and issued a notice to all manufacturers, saying: "Respectfully, in recent years, foreign goods have flooded the market, and the leakage has increased day by day, causing national goods factories to feel overproduction. Even the entire social economy is showing signs of collapse. To save the situation, we must open more national goods exhibitions to increase sales efforts. Our association is specifically holding the Wuxian National Goods Movement Exhibition at Guanqian Beiju, located in the most prosperous area. We are currently working hard to decorate and carefully prepare, and we will also hold recreational activities to entertain guests. It is scheduled to open on September 1st. The business hours of the market are from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm every day, so that each factory can operate as much as possible. We have long known that your factory produces excellent products that are popular far and wide. Therefore, we have specially enclosed a copy of the participation regulations and sent it with this letter. Please check it. If you want to participate, please come to the association to register as soon as possible. There are not many booths, so join quickly to avoid being left out when the quota is full. We hope you will not regret it."</p>
<p>The Shengze Chinese National Goods Promotion Association is holding a three-week Shengze National Goods Exhibition, so that the nearby public can have the opportunity to thoroughly understand national goods, in order to block the leakage of profits and restore rights. Shengze's water and land transportation is convenient, and the market is prosperous. It is predicted that the future results will be good. It is currently scheduled to open on the 20th of this month. Manufacturers who wish to participate can quickly register at the office at No. 42, West Qipan Street, Henan Road, telephone number 90932. There are restrictions on the types of industries. It is also reported that after the exhibition closes in Shengze, it is planned to continue holding it in other relevant counties and towns. The Xujiahui Observatory yesterday afternoon at 4:30 issued a weather forecast saying that the weather around Shandong is changing, foggy, and with showers. The wind is from the southeast to the southwest, due to a low pressure passing through Mongolia and moving eastward. The middle reaches of the Yangtze River are cloudy and still fine, with unstable breezes. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River still have showers and northeast winds. The East China Sea and Taiwan are cloudy, with southwest breezes. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 pm yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 87.3 degrees and the lowest was 75.6 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 96.1 degrees and the lowest was 77.4 degrees. Respected editor, yesterday I read in your newspaper a piece of news about the National Goods Promotion Association preparing for the Caobao Road National Goods Exhibition, which stated, "and the 3rd District Branch of the Citizens' Union and other public organizations jointly sent a letter requesting that it be based on the established case," etc., which is very surprising. Our association has not heard about this matter, nor has it jointly requested it with other organizations. It also said, "The standing committee members Chen, Xu, Fang, etc., have been sent to discuss the progress," but as of today, our association has not seen any personnel from the association come to contact us. Fearing that misunderstandings may arise, we specifically request a correction. We hope that it will be published accordingly. Addressed to: Shen Bao Newspaper Office, Shanghai Citizens' Union, 3rd District Branch, 24/8/14.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yan Xinquan)</p>
<p>If a person who is accustomed to a comfortable life has not encountered suffering, then he will certainly still feel unsatisfied with his comfortable life; but in the eyes of friends whose circumstances are absolutely opposite to his, he feels that being able to reach his level is already a great fortune.</p>
<p>Although soap can be used to wash clothes and remove dirt from the body, if you take a piece of clean white silk cloth, rub it with soap, and put it in the clearest water basin to wash, the clear water will still become turbid. Whose dirt is this, after all?</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhu</h3>
<p>— Ji'an</p>
<p>Next door to my house, there is a Mr. Zhu, whose words and actions are very peculiar. It is worthwhile to introduce him to the public, to prove that strange people are everywhere in this society.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu is a normal school graduate. When he first went to work as a teacher, he was like taking office as an official. The clothes he wore were completely new, and the bedding, mosquito nets, etc. were all new. He was originally opposed to wearing leather shoes, but this time he made an exception, spending eight silver dollars to buy a pair of long leather boots with patterned leather in Shanghai. He said, "To be a teacher, you must wear leather shoes, so that you can show off your prestige!" However, he only worked as a teacher for three months before quitting, because a student stole a pencil from him. He felt that the world was going downhill and people's hearts were not as good as before, and that there was nothing to gain from being a teacher.</p>
<p>What did Mr. Zhu do after he lost his job? Others were worried about him, but Mr. Zhu was leisurely and didn't feel anything. He arranged a schedule every day and did his rote work. Last time I went to his house to play, I saw that his schedule was written with: "Get up at 5:00 am every day, practice deep breathing, read scriptures from 7:00 to 10:00, read newspapers from 10:00 to 12:00, take a nap from 1:00 to 3:00, discuss national affairs from 3:00 to 5:00, sit quietly to cultivate one's nature from 7:00 to 9:00..." I couldn't help but laugh secretly when I saw his schedule. I thought: When other people lose their jobs, they go out to find solutions, but he stays at home every day doing boring work. What is his purpose after all?</p>
<p>Recently, my friend said, "Mr. Zhu has become much thinner than before because he is financially strapped after losing his job." However, I thought: Since this is the case, why is he doing boring work at home?</p>
<h3>Filial Daughter Cao E</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw a news report in the newspaper about "Rebuilding the Caojiang Filial Daughter Temple," saying that it was initiated by the famous Shanghai figure Wang Yiting and others, and it has been three years. Later, due to the poor market, the donations were few, less than 50,000 to 60,000, until August 1st, the main hall was finally able to be raised. It can be seen that the enthusiasm and perseverance of the gentlemen are truly admirable for their belief in the temple.</p>
<p>Cao E was just a daughter. Her father, named Xu, according to his profession, could only "play the rhythm and sing to please the gods," like a descendant of a shaman (see the Preface to the Cao E Stele). It was a very ordinary family background. Unexpectedly, Cao Xu drowned in the water during the ceremony to welcome the wave god at the head of the Qiantang River in May of the second year of Han'an (the reign of Emperor Shun of the Han Dynasty) (the wave god is said to be Wu Zixu, who advised King Fuchai of Wu, was given death, and thrown into the river with a leather bag. Later, a plain carriage and a white horse appeared from time to time, and the Yue people sacrificed to him). At that time, Cao E was only fourteen years old. When she learned of her father's death, she cried day and night by the river, running back and forth, trying to find her father. After seventeen days, she still couldn't find him. Alas! This weak woman jumped into the river, intending to investigate the situation on the spot. Five days later, she really floated up with her father's body in her arms. This shows that although a piece of filial piety cannot escape the myths of the predecessors, from Cao E's own point of view, she is indeed a filial daughter, which everyone can admit!</p>
<p>Therefore, in the past, Du Shang, the magistrate of Shangyu County, had a disciple named Handan Chun, who was still a young man. Du Shang asked Chun to write a Cao E stele inscription, and he immediately wrote it. At first, Wei Lang originally wrote it first, but Wei Lang knew that his writing was not as good as his, and immediately tore up the draft. Later, Cai Yong heard about this and suddenly became curious, thinking that this stele inscription must be read. He rushed there overnight and wrote on the back of the stele: "Yellow silk young woman, grandson pickle mortar," implying the four words "exquisite words." The value of the article can be imagined. In fact, without Cao E's filial piety, the writer's pen could not have achieved this. Now, because it was destroyed by fire seven or eight years ago, enthusiastic gentlemen have collected funds to rebuild it. It can be imagined that the temple will be brand new, and there will be many people who rub and read this stele inscription!</p>
<h3>Evening Scene of the Wharf</h3>
<p>— Yun Su</p>
<p>The Wai Ma Road in Shanghai's Shiliupu stretches for about a mile, occupied by noisy steamship wharves and warehouses. There, apart from the China Merchants South Station, there are two companies, Ningshao and Dada. Ningshao, in the afternoon when the sun is setting, is like a modern girl, with hundreds of thousands of people rushing into her arms to send寄 things; China Merchants Dada? It is lively from Shenshi to midnight. They are like Lord Mengchang of Qi, embracing the principle of universal rain and dew; along the river wharf, the moon-like electric lights illuminate the rolling long river, shining like ten thousand white snakes. Here, the shouting, the noise, the hawkers' cries, boil into one piece; my return trip is like following the waterway, taking the Xiaochangjiang steamship on the Shanghai-Yangzhou line. These evening scenes can be said to be understood in depth; Dada has been vigorously reformed by the principals in the past two years, and a ticket office has been added. Passengers returning north by boat must first taste the flavor of the window. The shipping company knows that everything is new, and also hangs up neon lights; a heavy streetcar is dragged from afar, and a group of coolies swarm up. This fly-like gathering is a group of porters and footmen; the old Shen Bao, the News, the evening newspaper of the day, and various tabloids are the shouts of old-fashioned newspaper vendors; Suzhou scenery, Wuxi scenery, the low and dumb bamboo pipe songs are the aquatic sideline business of the cultural street book vendors; "Do you want old-brand soap, Guangdong bananas?" These are the food hawkers coming and going; there are also those who do not use sound to represent, and like the cargo Lang Zizi, use响 器 to lure customers. They are the rebels of "one-word hall"! The owner can deceive the sky to bargain, and the buyer can 착地 to return the money; until the tram stops, the night is deep, and the steamship's chimneys emit the roar of lions and tigers! They slowly land, but at this moment, they still want to linger on the edge of the lighter, making a final sale to the customers on the outer舷. The sound of the whistle warns of departure. They drag their heavy footsteps, leaving the wharf, each face with a trace of a smile, indicating that they have made arrangements for tonight's white rice or black rice; at this time, the travelers standing outside the cabin also seem to be murmuring "Farewell Shanghai" in their hearts.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Don't Ask About a Daughter's Body, It's Hard to Express Hidden Pain; Strive to See the Face of a Noble Person, Admire the Noble Demeanor Together</p>
<p>He walked away congratulating himself like this, but that unfortunate woman kept sending him to the back courtyard to live. After Zhang Jiefu was stunned, he also withdrew and walked towards the house. However, the sound of high heels was the easiest to touch his nerves, so he immediately turned around to greet him. However, he saw that the woman's face was unfamiliar, and there were two bundles of luggage following behind, so he thought that she must be someone related to Commissioner Lan, and he couldn't offend her casually. Therefore, he straightened his face and flashed to the side. The woman said: "Are these the houses here?" He said, revealing a Nanjing accent. Jiefu dared not act rashly, expecting that his guess was right. Just at this time, the accountant in front came in with a roll of red paper and smiled: "Mr. Zhang, didn't you promise to write welcome slogans for us?" Jiefu puffed out his chest and said: "That's my bounden duty. Commissioner Lan, who is coming tomorrow, is our relative." When he said the sentence "is our relative," the voice was very loud. At the same time, he secretly shot his eyes at the woman. Sure enough, the three words "Commissioner Lan" were sent into the woman's ears. The woman seemed to be agitated as well, but Jiefu couldn't look at her too much, so he led the accountant into the house to write slogans. Jiefu was particularly diligent in this matter. He had already poured a bowl of ink, which was neither too thick nor too thin. The table was placed in the middle of the room, with white paper spread on it. Many large and small brushes were opened and placed on the edge of the table, and a large pile of newspapers was piled on the ground, all written with large characters, dripping with ink. (290)</p>
<h3>Royal Incense Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At that time, those half-open lotus flowers were indeed no longer blooming; they were all quietly waiting; the pink stamens still had not fully emerged.</p>
<p>The rays of the sun leaped over the countless roofs in the capital and shot straight towards the Western Hills. The Summer Palace also passed in its journey; finally, the speed of the sun's rise suddenly increased dramatically, almost jumping up inch by inch, so that it shone all over the lake, making the lake completely coated with a layer of silver.</p>
<p>Now the sun has completely revealed itself in the sky without any concealment!</p>
<p>The spectacle that the Empress Dowager mentioned had finally truly appeared!</p>
<p>At almost the same time, the sun was completely revealed in the sky, and the thousands of buds on the lake surface also all bloomed together; the petals were spread out flat, neatly attached to the green leaves. What surprised me the most was why those half-opened buds were waiting so eagerly before the sun fully emerged, and after the sun was fully hung out, they all bloomed together in an instant; could it be that sunlight has the magic to urge flowers to bloom? The miracles of nature are truly inconceivable.</p>
<p>Lotus flowers are usually mostly pink, and there are also quite a few white ones, but in Kunming Lake, there are quite a few rare species that are not commonly seen outside: on this day, the Empress Dowager was the first to discover two lotus flowers with a slightly green color. She was busy pointing it out to me and quietly told me that this was a famous species of great value. (390)</p>

<h3>Guest Talk on Official Experience</h3>
<p>— Yi Sheng</p>
<p>Wealth can be used to show off, and nobility can easily seek wealth and even more power. Therefore, the children of prominent families all hope that they will become officials in the future! Since the Republic of China, the number of officials has increased day by day, and it is even called the "Republic of Officials." Ordinary people can get half a post, which is a great joy! Therefore, there was a nursery rhyme in the era of the Beijing government: "Generals walk all over the streets, and commanders are as cheap as dogs!" This is similar to the time when An Lushan rebelled in the Tang Dynasty, when all the generals and Jiedushi's certificates were only enough to seek a drunken spree. According to this situation, those who really want to make a living by being officials, wouldn't a part of them become disastrous officials? Or, hanging an official title to scare the common people, otherwise embracing a false name to amuse themselves, it's still okay!</p>
<p>I have a cousin who was originally a writer. It is said that he also used to be an official and held concurrent positions. This makes my humble self considered a relative of an official, and I must have沾得 some official air—although he himself doesn't like others to mention his official affairs! The night before yesterday, we talked about being an official unintentionally. I pestered him to tell me the origin of his official position and the reason why he could be an official without leaving home. He actually agreed to tell me frankly.</p>
<p>"Do you want to know how I got the title of advisor to a certain army in the past? At that time, my friend Lao He—imitating the tone of "My Friend Hu Shih"—was appointed as the minister of a certain department of that army not long ago, and he automatically did me a favor by getting me that title. Although he is a reborn冯妇, he has spent a long time in poverty. We can be considered friends in poverty and lowliness, not only literary friends! That year, he prospered and came to Shanghai. I went to his residence to visit him, and I saw that his demeanor as an official was extraordinary: from afar, guards stood near the corners of the room, arching and guarding him in front and behind. When we sat down casually to chat! I knew about his recent situation, congratulated him, and then hurriedly said goodbye, originally to avoid him suspecting that I had any intention of asking him for something. Not many days later, he was stationed in Suzhou, but he sent a letter of appointment to my home through an organization under his jurisdiction in Shanghai, which was regarded as giving me that official title. I still remember that the servant who delivered the official document was a boy of only thirteen or fourteen with a northern accent, but he had learned some of the etiquette of the officialdom, saying "yes, yes, yes" all the time, and also "congratulations, sir, on your promotion," bowing one after another. His purpose was to get some tips. At that time, I also felt happy in my heart—although that advisor standing in the position of guest minister, his official name did not help with hunger and cold—the friendship of old friends was indeed rich; I gave the boy two dollars at once. He was also content, thanked me a thousand times, and left.</p>
<p>"As for the position of special commissioner of a certain provincial government in Shanghai, it came from a classmate surnamed Wu who exchanged Worcester porcelain with me. At that time, he was acting as the acting secretary-general of the provincial government due to special opportunities. I think he valued our past mutual friendship and recommended me to the acting chairman, almost saying that I was no less than Wolong and Fengchu—according to what he said in his letter—as a result, he attached the provincial government's commission to his private letter and sent it to me. The commission also had the words 'approved monthly allowance of one hundred yuan for a carriage and horse.' This was a paid position, because the province had not been established for long and was located in a remote border area. The provincial government wanted me to do propaganda work and handle official affairs in Beijing and Shanghai. After two months, I finally did some written work, but as for the salary with the beautiful name of夫马费, I repeatedly asked Wu Jun to collect it and remit it, but there was always only a wild goose going but no return. Soon, the political situation in the province changed, and my title of special commissioner was not added to by the successor, so it was listed in the 'human evolution and elimination.'</p>
<p>"These two official positions that didn't require me to go out also gave me a practical experience of a common saying, which is 'Don't be an official if you don't have anyone in the court'! What's the point of talking about it? An official like this with the nature of a bad check, how can it be loaded by cars and斗 in this Republic of China? Isn't that just making a mess?"</p>
<p>After hearing this, I couldn't help but feel that my cousin's official position was just like a small bubble disappearing with the political tide that pushed the front waves behind. The daily newspaper that I read during the day was placed in front of me, and in my hallucination, I seemed to vaguely hear the sound of the surging new tide coming from the folds of the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Satisfactory Outcome of Charity Tennis Tournament: Xu Chengji Defeats Lin Baohua, Qiu Feihai Loses to Carlsen Two Sets to None, Xu and Lin Win Doubles in a Thrilling Match, Xu Chengji Departs Shanghai This Morning to Return to Java, Ticket Sales Exceed 4,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The grand charity tennis tournament, initiated enthusiastically by Bureau Chief Wu Xingya and gentlemen Tan Jingsun and Lin Fang, with fervent support from all sectors, was held yesterday afternoon at the Chinese Tennis Club on Singapore Road. The outcome was exceptionally satisfactory. Approximately over a thousand spectators were in attendance. It is reported that ticket sales reached a considerable sum of four to five thousand yuan, which will be announced by the initiators in the coming days. As for the competition results, the most attention-grabbing was the first singles match, where Xu Chengji defeated Lin Baohua two sets to one: 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. Qiu Feihai lost to Carlsen two sets to none: 6-2, 6-2. The final, thrilling doubles match saw Xu Chengji and Lin Baohua win two sets to one against Carlsen and Dofu: 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. The performance concluded close to nightfall, with Madam Wu Xingya presenting awards, gifting each performing athlete with a large silver cup. Xu Chengji, eager to return home, decided to depart Shanghai this morning to return south.</p>
<p>Xu Defeats Lin Baohua: Xu Chengji 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, Lin Baohua</p>
<p>Consecutive Intense Battles Diminish Chengji's Performance: The previous day, play was halted due to rain. Xu had previously led Lin Baohua by a score of four games to zero. Because it was an exhibition and the weather was inclement, the previous score was not continued, and a new match was played. However, due to consecutive days of intense matches, Xu was noticeably fatigued. Therefore, his performance against Lin Baohua yesterday was significantly diminished. Although he emerged victorious, there were many close calls. Lin Baohua's performance was quite exceptional, truly "defeated but still impressive."</p>
<p>Lin Puts Forth All His Effort to Take the First Set: Lin Baohua approached yesterday's match against Xu Chengji with a do-or-die spirit. His half-court chops and powerful forehand drives put Xu Chengji in a desperate situation. Xu's serves yesterday were rarely good, and his drives lacked precision. Countless balls went out of bounds. Xu served first, losing the first two games. In the third game, Lin broke Xu's serve and surged ahead, winning four consecutive games. His subtle and flanking chops repeatedly defeated Xu, resulting in a score of 4-2. Many of Xu's forehand drives went out of bounds. Lin led 5-3. In the tenth game, with Lin serving, at 30-30, Xu inexplicably sent an easy volley into the net. Subsequently, Lin sent a high ball, which Xu mistakenly judged as out of bounds, thus losing the first set 6-4.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Retakes the Second Set: In the second set, Lin showed signs of fatigue after the intense battle of the first set. Xu remained remarkably calm, unhurriedly taking a 3-1 lead. However, due to numerous mistakes on both sides, the excitement of the match was greatly diminished. Lin, dissatisfied with a linesman's call, readily conceded the eighth game. Xu took a 5-3 lead and then won the second set 6-4. In this set, Xu began to anticipate Lin's chops and quickly responded, but his saves were still few and far between.</p>
<p>The Third Set Ends in Thrilling Fashion: Although the situation was very tense, Xu Chengji's victory seemed more assured, as Xu did not appear strained or exhausted, remaining remarkably calm. In the fourth game, due to Lin's double fault and a net touch on his serve, Xu took a 3-1 lead. However, in the next game, Xu unexpectedly lost his serve. After 3-3, Xu quickly won two more games, taking a 5-3 lead. In the ninth game, with Xu serving, he trailed 30-40, a perilous situation. In the next game, Lin was poised to make it 5-5, but unexpectedly, one of Xu's shots grazed the net and dropped over, leaving Lin, though at the net, helpless. After deuce, Xu won two more points in a row, winning the third set 6-3.</p>

<p>Qiu Feihai Loses to Carlsen: Carlsen 6-2, 6-2, Qiu Feihai</p>
<p>Old Qiu is Helplessly Decrepit: Carlsen and Qiu Feihai took the court next. Qiu had previously lost to Xu Chengji 7-5, 6-1, so yesterday's loss was also expected. Old Qiu is now old and past his prime. Against Carlsen, he had no chance of survival, unable to defend or attack. His only cross-court drive was also ineffective. Carlsen's serve speed, net coverage, and powerful smashes were superior to Qiu in every aspect. Qiu won one game in the first set. After 4-1, he won another game. The set ended 6-2. In the second set, after 3-0 and 4-1, each won one game. It also ended 6-2.</p>
<p>Doubles Exhibition Full of Thrills: Xu Chengji and Lin Baohua 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, Carlsen and Dofu</p>
<p>Xu Chengji's Performance is Divine: Xu Chengji did not fully display his skills in the singles match. However, when he took the court for the doubles match, his performance was simply divine and flawless. Lin Baohua was overshadowed. Moreover, the opponents were also skilled doubles players, making the doubles match full of thrills, with only Dofu being slightly weaker. Xu's serve, net play, and especially his powerful smashes from the baseline were rarely seen by Shanghai residents. If Xu and Lin worked together and trained, they would be a formidable doubles team. In the first set, both opened with a service win, but Dofu did not win his serve in the fourth game, allowing Xu and Lin to take a 3-1 lead. Each added two more games, making it 5-3. Xu served, winning the first set 6-3. In the second set, Carlsen's serve failed, making it 4-2. However, Xu and Lin also failed on their serves. A game that could have been won was instead won by the opponents, who won four games in a row, taking it 6-4, making it one set apiece. In the third set, Xu and Lin continued their efforts, winning 5-1 and then 6-2 to win.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Scheduled to Leave Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>Unfavorable Weather, Unsuitable for Flying: After the match, Mr. Sun Linfang delivered a speech, thanking everyone for their enthusiastic support and expressing gratitude on behalf of the disaster victims. He then presented each performing player with a silver cup as a memento. Madam Wu Xingya presented the awards. As for Xu Chengji, yesterday he was repeatedly persuaded by Tan Jing, Chen Qihao, and Yin Dong to stay longer and give more performances to repay the Shanghai people for their warm welcome. Chen Qijun was entrusted to inquire about airline information in order to fly south and avoid missing his ship. According to Mr. Chen, the previous passenger plane encountered wind along the way and was delayed for a long time. Given the windy conditions, flying was not advisable. The previous plan had to be abandoned. Xu, eager to return home, was difficult to keep. He is scheduled to take the Zinega of the Java Company at eight o'clock this morning, returning directly to Java. He may disembark for performances during the stopover in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>International Swimming Preliminaries: Chinese Team's Performance is Acceptable, Shi Bogen First in 400 Yards</h3>
<p>The international swimming competition held the preliminaries at the West Qing Pool last night at 8:30 PM. Originally, there were seven preliminary events, but because there were few participants in the 800-yard freestyle, it was changed to a final. In addition to that final, there were a total of six preliminary events. Five Chinese athletes, Shi Bogen, Liang Weisheng, Zhou Ruiqin, Jian Xuelian, and Jian Erjie, qualified. Shi Bogen's performance was the best. Shi came in second in the 800-yard final. In the 400-yard preliminary, Shi took first place in the first group.

Each preliminary event is divided into two groups. The top two in each group, as well as the third-place finisher with the best time, qualify. The third-place finishers in the two 100-yard freestyle groups, Liang Weisheng and Kinoshita (Japan), had the same time.

It is understood that Wang and Qian will arrive in Shanghai on the 18th. Unfortunately, they are arriving late and will miss the opportunity to discuss matters with Mr. Xu. Otherwise, with Wang Wenzheng's progress in tennis over the years, compared to Mr. Xu, their performance would surely be amazing (it is said that Mr. Wang once defeated Lin Baohua last year). It is reported that Mr. Chen Qihao is extremely apologetic because the Rongpu tennis performance has been repeatedly postponed due to rain.

<h3>Donghua and Others Submit to National Games: Requesting Inclusion of Small Ball as an Exhibition Event</h3>

The contents of the petition are copied below: Petition to support the Shanghai Small Ball Association's request to include small ball sports as an exhibition event in the National Games: Small soccer is a sport that has recently emerged as a distinct discipline. This sport offers the interest of soccer without its intensity and is simple to set up and economical in time, achieving both objectives. As such, it has quickly gained popularity throughout Shanghai. At the Shanghai Municipal No. 1 Public Sports Field, the small soccer competition had over 200 participating teams. The Shanghai West Small Soccer Competition Association (Qunhua Qiangguang, etc.) had over 300. The Shanghai East Competition (Pudong Youth Association Simple Sports Field, etc.) also had over 100 teams. Numerous other cup competitions have been held. It is estimated that there are over a thousand small ball organizations in Shanghai, indicating that this sport requires immediate attention and promotion. This time, the association is petitioning your committee to select the best players from this city to participate in the National Games exhibition. We are deeply moved by this and express our sympathy. We dare to jointly request that your committee approve the association's request to include small ball sports as an exhibition event in the National Games, in order to promote this sport and fulfill the public's expectations. We respectfully submit this petition to the Preparatory Committee of the Sixth National Games.</p>

<h3>Little Men (10) (4)</h3>
<p>— Original work by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>The water play was suddenly followed by a flurry of pillows flying chaotically in the air. Many little white-clad spirits emerged from their beds with a clamor, throwing these pillows. This war broke out in several rooms, along the upstairs corridor, and sometimes even spread to the nursery, as the pursued warriors sometimes retreated here. Strangely, it seemed that no one cared or even minded about this kind of outburst; no one tried to stop it or showed any surprise. Nansui kept hanging up many hands without interruption, and Mrs. Pei kept searching for clean clothes, acting as if nothing had been disturbed at all. No, she even joined in herself, chasing a reckless child out of the room and throwing back at him the pillow he had thrown at her.</p>
<p>"Aren't they going to get hurt?" Ned asked, watching drowsily, laughing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"Oh, no! We allow a pillow fight every Saturday night. The pillowcases will be changed tomorrow anyway; and after the children's baths, it helps their blood circulate and gives them a little more warmth; so I quite like it myself," Mrs. Pei said, while busily sorting out a dozen socks.</p>
<p>"What an extremely lovely school!" Ned exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>"This is a strange school," Mrs. Pei said with a smile; "you must know that we don't believe in too many rules or too much homework, just to make the children suffer. At first, I forbade them to get up in their pajamas and make trouble; but, thank you, that was completely useless. They are just like puppets in a toy box, as soon as they are put in, they will kneel up again. So I made a deal with them: I allow them fifteen minutes of 'pillow fight' every Saturday night; they promise to go to sleep quietly on the other nights. I tried it, and it worked. If they don't keep their promise, they don't get to play; if they do keep it, I hide away the glassware and put the lamps in a safe place, and just let them make a big fuss as they please."</p>
<p>"This is a wonderful plan," Ned said, feeling that he would like to join in this chaos, but not daring to make such a request on the first night. So he just fell asleep admiring the scene—it was indeed a lively scene.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Banks Suddenly Announce Contraction; Premium Jumps 10.5 Yuan; National Goods Congest, Briefly Showing a Downturn; Central Bank Opens, Pays Out 920 Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market has been unpredictable and difficult to grasp recently, and yesterday was no exception. Foreign banks contracted sharply, customs gold soared, the Hong Kong market was unusually tight, the foreign exchange market weakened repeatedly, and the market rose immediately. However, due to the congestion of national goods, some banks in the market seemed to be selling off, and confidence softened. Soon, it resumed its downward trend. Later, rumors spread that the Central Bank opened with 2,100 bars, and confidence rebounded, rising sharply. After closing, it even broke through the 920 yuan mark. Swaps were approaching, which should have helped to boost buying. In the morning, the overseas silver market fell across the board in both the UK and the US. Furthermore, the major players said that the market was weak after closing, that the East had a large supply, and that the US had little intention to buy. The final transaction price continued to fall 1.25 to 1.875 compared to the closing price. The forward silver price in Montreal fell by more than one cent. Foreign exchange lengthened slightly. London bullion fell by half a penny. Extramural preparatory transactions opened and immediately rose to 12 yuan. Hengchang Yongfu Xingyong immediately reached 15 yuan. Hengyu Richang Dade Chengfu Yu Shenfeng Yuanmao Yong and others successively supplied, falling to 11 yuan. After the opening, due to the announcement of the Central Bank's listing, both the UK and the US contracted, and the customs gold unit soared by 2.2 cents. The standard premium price was also listed at 931 yuan and 9 jiao, and confidence rebounded, stimulating buying and rising prices. Although there was some fluctuation, the foreign exchange market was unusually tight. HSBC's listing plummeted by 0.375 and 0.75 even higher. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, and major players also came to sell and settle. National goods banks vigorously sold foreign exchange, and the selling sentiment in the market became even more intense. Rumor has it that a certain bank sold off significantly, and confidence turned weak. Although the Hong Kong market was unusually tight again and again, the supply exceeded demand, and it gradually moved downstream. After entering, the foreign exchange market also hardened again, and major players sold even more smoothly. Although Chunyuan Yong tried hard to buy from time to time, it was difficult to stop the decline, but it did not break through the 10 yuan mark. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to act, which helped to pull up the prices. Although the Hong Kong market eased slightly, there were still supplies from the mainland. However, in the market, Chunyuan Yong and Futai Heng were keen to buy bars, and buying sentiment was strong. Rumor has it that the Central Bank opened with 2,100 bars, stimulating the rise in prices, so that after closing, it rose to 924 yuan. At 3:00 p.m. today, the September/October swap will be held, and the premium is generally expected to be 2-3 yuan from the short side. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>

Chunyuan Yong Fuxing Yong Tongyi Hengyu Tongfeng Heng Yifeng Yong advanced to 4.5 yuan. National goods, etc., were still selling off. The local foreign exchange market hardened. Shenfeng Yingzhi Xiangyuan Yifeng Yong Dadecheng Huixiang Yonghe Dingkang Dachangxiang successively sold bars, falling to 10 yuan. Daying bought back half a US dollar for September.

Hengyu retail Yingfeng Heng sold to within 5 yuan. At this time, it was still consolidating due to the Indian silver prediction of a contraction of four annas. Later, Hengyu Dadecheng Yifeng Yong Yongli sold bars, and it fell back to 3.9 yuan. Futai Heng forcefully bought without stopping. Yuansheng Yong Hengyu Fuxing Yong Dafayong Chunyuan Yong Yingfeng Heng Shenkang Tongyi came to advance, and it rose to 9.5 yuan.

More or less 2 yuan was over the previous closing price. The accounting price for this month was 915 yuan, and for September was 917 yuan. The morning supplement was 915 yuan. The price of red gold, after adding 4 yuan, was 915.5 yuan. There was a lack of spot transactions, and the market was stable. Tianjin goods, after adding 7 yuan, were worth this much, and the cooked red gold, after adding 10 yuan, were worth this much. Predictions for the current September/October swap differed. Generally, the short side needed to advance 2-3 yuan. However, since the Central Bank had already opened and advanced 2,100 bars of spot goods, and the price was the same as the futures, the swap seemed to be boosting the bullish sentiment, but it was also uncertain. However, historically, short positions have released quite a few public orders, and it seemed that the reserve was not lacking. There were still fourteen bars left for this month, with only one bullish position, Fuxing Yong, and one bearish position, Yongfeng.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was quite active, and the buying sentiment of major players seemed to be stronger than the selling side. In total, Chunyuan Yong (advancing more than 2,400 bars), Futai Heng Tongfeng Heng (more than 1,800 bars), Fuxing Yong Huixiang Dada Dafayong, etc., were on the buying side.

Fusheng Yong Yuxin Xiang Houyu Hengyu advanced and then sold. Dingkang Chunyuan Yong Yuqingyong Richang Wanfeng sold first and then advanced.

The Guangdong gang, Hengxing, did not advance or sell much. Shengda advanced and sold several dozen bars each. The total number of transactions in the first half of the day was 68,516 bars.</p>

<h3>Foreign Banks Shrink, Hong Kong Market Soft; British and American Exchange Rates Overtly and Covertly Tight; National Goods Massively Sold... Initially Lacking Maintenance, Then Turning Loose</h3>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London major bills shrank by nearly 1.875, and far bills shrank by 2.5. Major players said that the market was weak after closing, with a large amount of selling from the East, but little buying interest from the US. Furthermore, the final closing price continued to fall 1.25 to 1.875. The New York silver market also shrank by 3.75. The forward silver price in Montreal fell sharply by 1.06 to 1.15 cents. London bullion shrank by half a penny. British currency rose by 0.25 against the US dollar, and by 7 pounds against the French franc. The US dollar rose by 0.0625 against the British pound, and was unchanged against the French franc.

After opening, the Central Bank's listing was announced, with British currency shrinking by 0.25 and US currency shrinking by 0.4375. The customs gold unit rose sharply by 2.2 cents, stimulating confidence and making it even tighter. Although banks sold off due to the high prices, demand exceeded supply, and the trend weakened repeatedly. In addition, HSBC's listing contracted by 0.375 for British currency and 0.75 for US currency, and the process was extremely tight. National goods took advantage of the trend to sell off. However, due to repeated reports of tightness in the Hong Kong market, although it was loose, there was a lot of consolidation. Eventually, national goods tended to sell off, and the confidence of Chinese merchants was not strong, so they also came to sell, and it initially lacked maintenance and turned loose. Later, due to rumors of the Central Bank opening for spot goods, the confidence of Chinese merchants rebounded and they came back to buy, which was able to maintain the market. Although the Central Bank sold off, and the Indian silver prediction shrank by 4 annas, Xinfeng Foreign Firm came to buy shillings aggressively, and although the Central Bank and others sold off, the process was still trending tight. By closing, the recent selling prices were 1 shilling and 5.375 pence for British currency and 36.0625 yuan for US currency, which was 0.375 tight for British currency and 0.6875 tight for US currency compared to the previous close. Chinese merchants were either buying or selling, and the demand and supply were uneven. After clearing, there was a lack of advance and sell off. National goods banks sold off approximately 100,000 pounds of shillings and 300,000 US dollars. Sassoon bought back more than 100,000 pounds of shillings.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Only Had Swap Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and the market still had not escaped the state of hovering stagnation. Trading was quiet, major players were inactive, and the trading floor mostly saw only swap transactions. The long position in No. 48 secretly engaged in swaps, with market prices fluctuating, hovering only between two or three jiao. No. 21 saw slight selling, and No. 4, No. 72, and No. 11 of the 1996 Public Bonds were sold, dropping to the ten-yuan mark, and they are poised to break into the major levels, with a trend of continuing decline. Yesterday, at the opening, various bond markets were stable. The troop reduction bonds for this month rose by two jiao due to the excessive drop the day before, and people's minds seemed to stabilize slightly. Afterwards, they all saw rises of about one or two jiao. The 1996 bonds were uniquely dominated by selling pressure, falling by about two jiao. The situation in the second session was slightly better, with more swap transactions, and retail investors also showed interest. The 1919 Customs Bonds were particularly good at three jiao, and the rest also rose by five fen to one or two jiao. The future will inevitably hover, but the long position in No. 48 is engaging in a lot of skillful swaps to avoid direct conflict, and the market price is not likely to have major fluctuations for the time being. The results were mostly slightly better, ranging from five fen to one jiao to three and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was 6,825,000 yuan. The rise and fall results are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan) Exchange Announcement: The original plan to suspend futures trading for this month on the 27th is now changed to the 24th due to the market being closed on the 27th.</p>

<h3>The Meteoric Rise of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Stock</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Sun Fung Company, the New York stock market yesterday (the 13th) saw a slight price increase. Investors made huge purchases of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and the stock soared to its highest peak since 1931. This event also triggered buying in other sectors, so the recent strength of various industrial stocks was not affected by profit-taking. Railroad stocks and utility stocks were quite active. The bond market rose, and small exchange stocks also rose, with utility stocks being the strongest. The total daily trading volume was 2.36 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Exchange Rate Adjustment Reduces Margin, Prices Soar, Bullish Sentiment Rises in Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the situation was particularly strong. Because the exchange rate tended to shrink and the margin increased, rumors arose again in the market, and the old story of inflation was brought up again. This was actually because general speculators and industry insiders saw that many yarn mills were closed, and they were very enthusiastic about going long on cotton yarn. When the price fell, people bought, and as the trading floor tightened, the market rose. However, the environment was still poor, and current yarn sales were bleak, and all parties were still restricted by finance.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Soars by Two Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the pre-market trading in spot yarn, the prices of all months rose uniformly, and the momentum was quite tight. Because the margin increased, the market was full of rumors, and shorts were covering their positions. However, the overseas cotton market was still weak, and second-grade yarn fell by more than two yuan. Local buying interest was still strong. As a result, the prices of all months rose by one yuan to one yuan and three, five, eight jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon session, buying became more intense, and people's minds were tense, saying that the off-exchange trading after the margin closed had exceeded 923 or 924 yuan. Therefore, buyers gathered and came in, and the pace became tighter and tighter. However, when the market was about to close, Da Fu took profits, and the market price rebounded slightly. More than 600 bales of spot yarn were traded. As a result, the prices of all months rose by three, six, seven jiao compared with the closing price of the morning session. It was found that Da Fu sold 3,050 bales, Tongji 900 bales, Guangfeng 600 bales, Shenchang 750 bales, Changyu 550 bales, Shenchang 1,200 bales, Yicheng 400 bales, Deji 400 bales, and Changfeng 600 bales. Jifeng bought 550 bales, Meiji 650 bales, Hexing 1,850 bales, Dachangcheng 850 bales, Taichang 2,050 bales, Yichang 1,950 bales, Yuanda 550 bales, Minghua 1,200 bales, and Dachang 550 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>August　175.4　173.7　175.2　Up 1.60　3,300</p>
<p>September　175.3　173.5　175.1　Up 2.20　45,550</p>
<p>October　175.1　173.4　175.0　Up 2.10　55,850</p>
<p>November　175.2　173.7　175.0　Up 2.00　54,850</p>
<p>December　175.0　173.7　175.0　Up 2.10　51,800</p>
<p>January　174.9　173.5　174.9　Up 2.10　17,400</p>
<p>Total　244,750</p>
<p>More Than 600 Bales of Spot Yarn Traded</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were average. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 645 bales throughout the day, and the price rose by five jiao. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 230, Guangdong 10, Changsha 10, Fellow Traders 60, Xuzhou 15, Wuhu 10, Sichuan 200, Jiangxi 20, Zhenjiang 10, Hankou 20</p>
<p>The cotton market tended to be strong, and the rise was surprisingly intense. Because the margin rose again and the exchange rate was adjusted to shrink, the bulls were very active, buying and adding to their positions. In addition, the bulls held on to the August contracts and never let go. The general shorts had to cover their positions with pain, and the market became stronger and stronger. However, when the market was about to close, Da Fu sold off in large quantities.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao's Short Squeeze Intensifies</p>
<p>At the opening of the pre-market trading in spot cotton, the prices of all months rose uniformly. Although American cotton fell, because the exchange rate was hanging and shrinking and the margin tended to be high, at the same time, the short squeeze situation in the August contracts was urgent, and there were quite a few shorts covering their positions. The market rose higher and higher, and as a result, the prices of all months rose by four jiao to five and a half jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the afternoon session, there were many rumors in the market, and the buying was very strong. Many said that the off-exchange trading after the margin closed had exceeded 922 or 923 yuan, so people's minds were shaken, and the market became stronger. However, third-grade cotton fell by eight or nine jiao, and when the market closed, Da Fu took large profits, and the market price loosened slightly. As a result, the prices of all months rose by three and a half jiao to one and a half jiao compared with the closing price of the morning session. It was found that Yuan Yi sold 11,200 dan, Shengyuan 2,000 dan, Dachang 1,300 dan, Renfeng 1,400 dan, Jifeng 1,400 dan, Da Fu 8,000 dan, Yuanda 1,400 dan, Senkang 1,700 dan, Tongxingchang 4,300 dan, Chang 5,800 dan, Hengchang 2,000 dan, Yongda 7,500 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,300 dan, Yikang 2,500 dan, and Xinheng 2,400 dan. Jifeng bought 3,400 dan, Tongji 11,600 dan, Meiji 1,300 dan, Mingde 1,300 dan, Hexing 4,100 dan, Yichang 2,600 dan, Runkang 9,700 dan, Tonghe 4,400 dan, Daji 4,300 dan, Changyu 1,800 dan, Taichang 4,600 dan, and Changhe 2,500 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Change　Inventory</p>
<p>August　36.75　36.35　36.70　Up 0.65　115,400</p>
<p>October　34.55　33.95　34.45　Up 0.70　180,900</p>
<p>November　33.90　33.40　33.80　Up 0.60　157,100</p>
<p>December　33.85　33.40　33.85　Up 0.60　123,300</p>
<p>January　33.95　33.45　33.95　Up 0.65　43,000</p>
<p>Total　619,700</p>
<p>Consumption of Raw Cotton Remains Sluggish</p>
<p>Consumption of spot cotton is still normal, and factory demand is relatively weak. The source is estimated to be 395 bales of Yao cotton:</p>
<p>Actual Cotton　52.50　Yongan Factory Purchase　82 Pieces　Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Actual Cotton　52.00　Yongan Factory Purchase　82 Pieces　Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet　43.15　Chongxin Factory Purchase　400 Pieces　Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton　42.50　Shenxin Factory Purchase　100 Pieces　Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<h3>World Cotton Markets Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, and prices for all months fell by five to eight points. The market price in the early morning was weak due to bad news from Liverpool, selling by foreign merchants, and profit-taking by bulls. It then stabilized slightly due to buying by fellow traders and short covering. In the afternoon, New Orleans, local gangs, Wall Street, cotton farmers, and the public all sold, and the market fell again. Weather reports indicated that the southwestern cotton area had turned cool and rainy, and hedging increased, which was the main reason for the market's instability. Unfortunately, the lending problem often prevented sellers from selling large amounts. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points, and futures prices fell by 14 to 18 points. English cotton spot prices fell by 7 points, and futures prices fell by 3 to 5 points. When Indian cotton was at a low price, European exporters bought slightly, and shorts also covered their positions. There were not many sellers, and the market was stable. It is estimated that Pingguoer fell by 0.75 rupees, Oumula fell by 0.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.375 to 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 13th):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day in National Currency English Cotton Compared to Previous Day in National Currency</p>
<p>October　10.93 Down 14　34.00 Spot　647 Down 7　40.70</p>

<p>April-May Futures　204.625 Down 0.375 29.90</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for April-May futures of Bailuoxi cotton on the 14th was 202 rupees, down 2.625 rupees from the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<h3>Food: Outside Bulls Continue to Absorb Spot Flour</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was weak and stable in the early sessions of both the morning and afternoon. The quoted price for foreign wheat was down one or two jiao in Chicago and two jiao in Canada. The market sentiment was that although domestic consumption was not very smooth, factory inventories were not very abundant. In addition, the price of foreign wheat was difficult to determine for a while, and the price of domestic wheat was also seen as expensive, so it was stable in the midst of weakness. By the afternoon sessions, the market gradually stabilized because the price of gold rose sharply, and it was rumored that the banking industry was still looking for continued highs. Outside bulls continued to absorb smoothly. Although some large factories sold off, the market was as stable as usual. It was rumored that talk of currency circulation had started again in the market, and future ups and downs were inevitably related. As a result, this month was up by a small two and a half li, September was up by two and a half li, October was up by two and a half li, and November and December were up by two and a half li.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Rose in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market opened in the morning, and the prices for all months were generally flat and weak. Because the quoted price for foreign wheat fell slightly by one or two jiao, the asking price for each month was also slightly lower than the previous day by one or two fen. Trading in each session was also light. Until the afternoon session opened, the market rose step by step again. Because the price of gold rebounded, the current asking price for foreign wheat was around five yuan, and the price of wheat in the mainland was still holding up, not softening with the Shanghai market, so trading turned strong and the market was good. Observing the later steps, it will present a situation of long-term strength and short-term weakness. As a result, this month rose by three fen, September rose by four fen, October rose by five fen, November rose by two fen, and December rose by three fen. The current wheat market yesterday again refused to open because the factory was thinking of pressing the price down by a few fen before showing intention to buy. Customers in the mainland were unwilling to let go, so there were no only bags seen delivered.</p>
<h3>Three Truckloads of New Anhui Premium Rice Arrived – Foreign Rice Sales Are Very Active –</h3>
<p>The source of this rice (South Shanghai) was particularly scarce for all gangs yesterday, with only the 7th or 8th number arriving (a total of 1,400 to 1,500 shi). People's minds were still stable, but in terms of sales, this street was sluggish, and the Qingdao gang only handled 400 or 500 bags, so the market did not see solidity due to the scarcity of arrivals, but instead felt instability in the stability. If the prices of various thick japonica rice had no honor or disgrace, the thin indica rice market eventually fell by several fen to nearly a jiao because of more arrivals. As for the new japonica rice from Pudong, it stabilized with the rain, and the yin yuan also had no difference because the supply and demand were similar, and the reed tips were all evenly priced.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, three truckloads of new premium rice from Anhui Province arrived, about 700 to 800 shi. Sales were sluggish, with only more than 300 shi sold. The market outlook was not particularly good. The sources from various roads in Hexia were the 16th and 17th numbers, and the white japonica rice on the market was still weak. Early indica and thin indica rice had ordinary retail sales, and market prices were all weak by several fen to one jiao. 600 to 700 shi of Dongxin japonica rice arrived, retail sales were not smooth, and the price was stable. The other goods also showed signs of weakness.</p>
<p>Foreign rice sales were very active yesterday, and the customer gangs also had entertaining transactions, so the market showed a hovering situation. Initially, floating traders sought to get out, and new Ningbo rice continued to arrive, and the market was again flat and weak. Then, this street smoothly handled tribute rice, and the mainland handled broken rice and rice, and the Ningbo gang also had Siam broken rice to entertain. The new Ningbo rice was also handled by this street and Beiyang, and the market turned from weak to strong. The Quanzhou gang's purchases were as plain as the previous day, and the market turned stable again with the arrival of high-quality Saigon. A total of 5,000 bags of Saigon, 300 bags of Siam broken rice, and 453 bags of new early rice from Ningbo were opened throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Chinese Silk Sees New Prices Every Day</h3>
<p>The silk market has risen frequently in the past half month (Yokohama has risen by about 100 yuan compared to the previous month, and New York has risen by more than 2.5 jiao). At present, it is still strong, and the price of Shanghai colored silk is also soaring due to the recent shortage of goods. However, there are still new prices traded every day. Based on this phenomenon, the eagerness of foreign real sales demand can be seen, so the market sentiment in Shanghai is increasingly inclined to be bullish. Yesterday, Xinfu and Dachang purchased 100 bales of white factory and gray warp, and the price was as firm as ever. See the market price column.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Blue, Red, and White Sugar Become Tight Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Customs Gold in the sugar market suddenly rose, once reaching 1.870, so the market turned tight. Yesterday was the due date for the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company's sale, which included 500 bags of Five Sheep Coarse White Sugar, at 17.2 yuan, all of which were distributed, an increase of half a jiao. A slightly lower batch of more than 2,000 bags was bid at 17 yuan but failed. 1,000 bags of Medium Sand White Sugar were bid at 16.5 yuan, and 15 bags were traded. 2,000 bags of Dutch Coarse White Sugar were bid at 17.25 yuan, and 400 bags were traded, an increase of 2 jiao. In addition, 500 outer bags of Chaozhou Secondary White Sugar were put up for auction, at 16 yuan. The guild's pan called for an initial price of 17.3 jiao for 24 bags of coarse sand white spot, but then several dozen bags were traded at 17.23 jiao. The re-export cargo was called at 5.45 yuan, but failed. The Taikoo Sugar B mark was 18.1 jiao, an increase of 5 fen. The Zhenyu No. 1 Pure White Sugar from this factory was 16.5 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao, and the rest were returned as before. Chao Qing's sales increased with the Qingdao gang's activity, with more than 1,000 bags of Huanggang Qing being opened, with prices ranging from 10 yuan to 9.9 jiao, and slightly less for the secondary ones. Dong Bai also rose by half a jiao, J mark at 16.55 jiao, N mark at 16.4 jiao, Dong Chi at 13.2 jiao. A small amount of domestically produced Xinghua Red Sugar was opened, and the price rose to 12.3 jiao, which was better than before by 3 jiao.</p>

<h3>Two Knives and a Pair of Pliers</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Who has the greatest power to promote national goods? I say it is the people who hold two knives and a pair of pliers.</p>
<p>The first knife is the tailor who uses scissors. For example, one day the tailors get together for a large meeting and decide on a trade agreement saying: "From now on, we will refuse to make any clothes from non-national goods fabrics." In this way, no matter how trendy and fashionable the young masters and ladies are, they cannot but submit to the scissors of the head tailor. Perhaps the great success of national goods comes from the hands of tailors. It is said that in some places, many tailors have already implemented this, and when they encounter a Westernized young master or a modern woman entrusting them to make clothes from foreign fabrics, although they do not necessarily refuse, they always announce that Madam So-and-so or Miss So-and-so from the So-and-so household does not use national goods but uses foreign goods. In this way, everyone is somewhat wary, thinking that it is somewhat scary for people with scissors to have patriotism.</p>
<p>The second knife is the friend who cuts paper and sharpens pencils. If they are determined not to cut foreign paper and not to sharpen foreign pencils when using a knife to cut paper or sharpen a pencil, then at least China's stationery industry can improve somewhat, and the paper mills that are about to close may not be without a solution. This knife should also be used with caution.</p>
<p>The third friend holding pliers to open soda, orange juice, beer, etc., please be silent for half a minute before opening the bottle and look at the trademark on the bottle to see if it is a national good or not. If it is not a national beverage, I advise you not to easily open this bottle cap. In particular, those who are doctors and waiters should not let small copper coins block their hearts and act like crazy people, opening and pouring all kinds of foreign soda and beer to act as salesmen for foreign merchants. Master Yiyiguan</p>
<h3>Saving the Country Should Start with Oneself</h3>
<p>— Master Qiaqiaguan</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Shilin said: "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." Today, our country is suffering from both internal and external troubles, and the pressure is on each other. Natural disasters and man-made disasters occur frequently year after year. If we let this situation continue, the country will surely perish! As a national, how can we sit idly by and not save it?</p>
<p>But, "Save the country!" "Save the country!" You advise me to save the country, and I also advise you to save the country. Everyone only knows how to focus on others saving the country, and does not know how to focus on themselves saving the country. This kind of "saving the country" will only result in you deceiving me and me deceiving you. "Saving the country" may also turn into "destroying the country"!</p>
<p>Now, let's not talk about anything else, let's just talk about the matter of "saving the country with national goods." Ah! Everyone must promote "national goods"! The reason why the country has become so poor and weak is because everyone does not know how to promote "national goods"! Therefore, you advise me to promote "saving the country with national goods," and I also encourage you to promote "saving the country with national goods." But in reality, does everyone really promote "saving the country with national goods"? No, everyone is promoting "destroying the country with foreign goods." Friends, don't blame me for saying this too harshly. Facts tell us that this is indeed the case! If you don't believe me, then please take the time to check the old accounts of the past two years - "National Goods Year" and "Women's National Goods Year" - and see what the results are. Alas! Isn't the "import surplus" of "foreign goods" increasing rather than decreasing? The "import surplus" of "foreign goods" continues to increase. The more it makes the whole of China lifeless! Everywhere you only hear about "bankruptcy" and "economic downturn." Thinking about it carefully, this is really because everyone is not sincere in saving the country. On the surface, it is you advising me and me advising you. In reality, it is just mutual deception and mutual use! If this continues, wouldn't "saving the country" also turn into "destroying the country"?</p>
<p>Therefore, my humble opinion is that "saving the country should start with oneself." In other words, for the current plan, the only way is for everyone to strive for themselves, so that we can save the country. "Saving the country with national goods" is also the same. There is no need to focus solely on others, and you cannot solely supervise others. As long as you can sincerely save the country and seriously promote "national goods," that's fine. If everyone is like this, then the goal of "saving the country with national goods" will eventually be achieved one day. Otherwise, it's just talk. Now that this "Student National Goods Year" is almost three-quarters over. So, with this remaining quarter of a year, I hope everyone will use the spirit of "saving the country should start with oneself" and step up their self-efforts!</p>
<h3>Believe it or Not!</h3>
<p>— Lu Xiangxian</p>
<p>Nowadays, nine out of ten middle school students use fountain pens to write letters.</p>
<p>Taking schools as a unit, the percentage of students wearing imported Western suits is 3% in elementary schools, 10% in middle schools, and more than 60% in universities. But university students are the most outstanding young people in China.</p>
<p>Long gowns made of indanthrene cloth have recently become increasingly popular, with elementary school students and middle school students wearing them the most.</p>
<p>The belts that students like to wear the most mostly come from Hong Kong, but they are sold by national goods companies.</p>
<p>Go to the school dormitory to take a look, and of the ink bottles placed on the desks, one-tenth are Waterman, three-tenths are Carter, two-tenths are Minsheng and Butterfly brand and others. Remember! This year is Student National Goods Year! Baling</p>
<h3>Two Things Worth Celebrating</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Promoting domestic goods is a permanent endeavor, not something confined to a specific year or time. We should always keep the promotion of domestic goods in mind, no matter when or where we are. Whenever an opportunity arises, we should find ways to promote it, so that our country's domestic goods movement can achieve good results and great achievements under our efforts." These are words that I, as a reporter, often share with friends who are passionate about the domestic goods movement.</p>
<p>Recently, I have discovered two things in our Republic of China's domestic goods movement that are worth celebrating and deserve to be highlighted here. I am writing them down now to show that our country's domestic goods movement, after some time of effort and promotion by many people, has indeed achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>The first thing is the reduction of import surplus. According to the report of the International Trade Weekly of the International Trade Bureau, the total value of foreign goods imported into our country in the first half of the year was 545,455,295 yuan, and the total value of exports was 259,369,672 yuan. As a result, the import surplus was 286,085,623 yuan. In the same period last year, the import value was 569,849,836 yuan, the export value was 268,544,717 yuan, and the total import surplus was 301,300,5123 yuan. Comparing the first half of last year with the first half of this year, the import surplus has decreased by 15,219,500 yuan in the first half of this year. Isn't this something worth celebrating? It shows that promoting domestic goods, as long as we continue to work hard, can definitely achieve results. Mr. Pan Yangyao said: "We must contribute our share to the promotion of domestic goods, no matter how small. Doing something is always better than doing nothing." These words have great significance. From now on, I hope everyone will be determined to work hard and diligently to do more for the domestic goods movement. Then, when the statistics are compiled next year, there will definitely be good results to reveal to us.</p>
<p>The second thing is the great unity of domestic cigarette companies. We know that the unity of domestic industry peers is a very effective and powerful organization. The worst thing is competition among peers, mutual killing among peers. Tianxu Wosheng said: "Competition among peers is the death certificate of the domestic goods business." This sentence is very reasonable. Now the domestic cigarette industry is the first to wake up, which is really a good phenomenon and a good organization. From now on, I believe that the domestic cigarette industry will have considerable development and extraordinary progress. I hope that the unity of the domestic cigarette industry will influence other domestic goods businesses to continue to unite, jointly discuss the standards of products, discuss marketing channels, study the improvement of goods, and set consistent prices. If all these things can be done step by step, how can the domestic goods business fail to stand firm? Therefore, on the one hand, I express my great approval of the unity of the domestic cigarette industry. At the same time, I especially hope that other industries will also unite and stand on the same front, working hard and fighting for the domestic goods business. That is what I hope for twelve thousand times.</p>
<p>Writing in a rambling way, I have already taken up a lot of space. I am very sorry. Finally, I sincerely pray that my hopes will not become illusions and that there will always be a factual manifestation.</p>
<h3>Written for the Aspiring Students</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Time flies like a galloping horse! In the blink of an eye, summer vacation has arrived again! Aspiring students, happily returning home, what work will you do during this summer vacation? I, the writer, am not talented, but may I humbly offer some suggestions for the students?</p>
<p>This year "is the Student Domestic Goods Year." As the name suggests, have students made efforts for the domestic goods movement? This is something that should be reflected upon. More than half of the Student Domestic Goods Year has passed! So, during this summer vacation, we should do more work to promote domestic goods. My humble opinion is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Compile a Domestic Goods Survey Form</p>
<p>The things we need in our daily lives, such as food, supplies, and clothing, are all available as domestic goods, and some are even better than imported goods. However, while we have a deep impression of the famous domestic goods, there are so many other names that we can't remember them all! Therefore, compiling a domestic goods survey form is extremely urgent! Such as the place of origin of domestic goods, production status, supply and demand situation, comparison of advantages and disadvantages, comparison of prices, reasons why Chinese people like to use them or not... In short, the more detailed the better.</p>
<p>(2) Urge Parents to Buy Domestic Goods: A General Mobilization Your fathers, mothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, etc. If you find them fond of buying imported goods, you should gently explain the benefits of using domestic goods. If it doesn't work after repeated attempts, you might as well resort to "military persuasion." The so-called "military persuasion" is to smash the foreign goods! After smashing them, if you are beaten or scolded, you can then persuade them while crying. No parent will not be moved and follow your good advice!</p>
<p>(3) Organize a Summer Student Consumer Cooperative Students in each region and from the same hometown should unite, regardless of their schools (different schools), and use their saved pocket money to form a small capital and organize a "Summer Student Consumer Cooperative." For each individual's self-study supplies and the stationery, books, brushes, ink, etc. needed after the start of school, purchase them wholesale from domestic goods companies in bulk. This not only saves the high cost of buying retail, but also allows you to practice business experience. Be sure to choose an older, capable, and honest leader. Female students may also participate, because women are more meticulous and patient in internal affairs than men. "Studying without forgetting the domestic goods movement" can indeed be realized! Students can also work hard to pay attention to the import surplus situation in the customs trade booklets, comparative charts of people's love for domestic goods in various countries around the world, and various statistics on domestic goods! I look forward to amazing results!</p>
<h3>Improving Silk Cotton Manufacturing Methods</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Silk cotton is a rich product of Zhejiang Province. Its effect of keeping out the cold is light and warm, and the price is also very cheap, which is better than wool and leather goods. However, it is a pity that the manufacturing method is not good, and it often exudes oil and turns yellow over time, resulting in a drop in selling price. The Haining Silk Cotton Factory therefore sent a letter to the Machine Association, asking Tianchu Wosheng to find a way to solve this problem. After many trials, it was indeed successful. Every catty of silk cotton has its silkworm pupa oil removed during manufacturing, and it is bleached. The cost is less than a dime, and it will never change color. It can also increase toughness and luster. Because I think that most women in the countryside stick to the old methods and do not know how to improve them, once they turn yellow, it is a lot of trouble to try to salvage them. Therefore, it is advisable to do it while it is still wet at the beginning of manufacturing, so that the finished products can be uniform. Therefore, it is specially made public as follows for those with knowledge to spread and adopt.</p>
<p>The equipment and procedures used are all in accordance with ordinary methods, that is, the cocoons are boiled in soup, and then boiled with alkali as usual. After peeling out the silkworm pupae, each five liang is made into a sheet, and each twenty sheets is made into a skein. Each six skeins are soaked in a one-dou crock. The original amount of water in the half-lead bucket was about fifteen catties. Now, the following medicines should be added to this water:</p>
<p>(Alkali Substitute) Use eight taels of anhydrous sodium carbonate for each batch, first dissolve it in fifteen catties of water, then add four taels of light calcium hydroxide, heat to boil, let it stand until it settles, and then take the clear liquid to soak six skeins of silk cotton for about four hours. Take it out and rinse it with cold water to start bleaching. If you don't bleach it immediately, it's okay to soak it in clean water for a long time. The above is a self-made "caustic soda solution", which saves 70% compared to using caustic soda. The purpose is to combine the pupa oil contained in it with alkali to form soap, so it can be washed away and not left in the silk cotton, so that it will oxidize, turn yellow, and smell. Then carry out acid bleaching as follows:</p>
<p>(Bleaching Agent) Use eight taels of "anhydrous sodium sulfite" for each batch and dissolve it in fifteen catties of water to become solution A. Separately, use four taels of hydrochloric acid with a specific gravity of 20 degrees and dissolve it in fifteen catties of water to become solution B. You can use a beaker to measure 160 cc (equal to four Chinese taels). Soak the bleached silk cotton that has been alkalized and degreased in solution A first, take it out and wring it dry after five minutes, then move it to solution B and soak it for five minutes, take it out and wring it dry, and then rinse it with clean water. Then, dry it in the usual way, and it will become pure white silk cotton without flaws.</p>
<p>After using the above bleaching agent once, just add four taels of "anhydrous sodium sulfite" to solution A and eighty cc of "20-degree hydrochloric acid" to solution B, and add water to make up the original amount. You can use it again without discarding it. Therefore, the actual consumption is only half each time. Moreover, it does not take much time and effort. Anyone who uses the old method to make silk cotton can improve it in this way.</p>
<p>The chemicals used are already produced in our province, but you need to buy them in bulk to get a good price; buying pounds retail is quite expensive. If you calculate according to the chemical reagent price list of the Instrument Museum, anhydrous sodium carbonate and sodium sulfite are both one yuan per pound, and 20-degree hydrochloric acid costs half a yuan per pound. Therefore, if you do a small test to see the effect, it doesn't matter if it's expensive. If you are manufacturing in large quantities, you should use 2,000 catties of silk cotton as a unit and purchase a box of anhydrous sodium sulfite, which costs 58 yuan, two boxes of 20-degree sulfuric acid, which cost 14 yuan and 40 cents, and four and a half dan of anhydrous sodium carbonate (pure alkali), which costs about 32 yuan, for a total of 104 yuan and 40 cents, plus about 110 yuan for loading and transportation, etc. The chemicals used per catty of silk cotton cost less than six cents. As for light calcium hydroxide, which is hydrated lime, you can buy quicklime locally, add 40 catties of water to every 100 catties of quicklime, sprinkle it to make it disintegrate into powder, and then sift it before use.</p>
<h3>The Shame of Students</h3>
<p>— Wei Yuan</p>
<p>This year is called the Student Domestic Goods Year. This does not mean that only students should try their best to purchase domestic goods this year, while other people can be more casual. In fact, all citizens should try their best to purchase domestic goods. The reason why this year can be called the Student Domestic Goods Year is to expect students to have special achievements in adopting domestic goods this year.</p>
<p>Half of the Student Domestic Goods Year has passed. Where are the achievements?</p>
<p>Students are the basic personnel of the country in the future, which no one can deny. If students cannot try their best to purchase domestic goods during the Student Domestic Goods Year, the future of the country is really chilling!</p>
<p>Leaving aside other things, let's just talk about paper, which is most closely related to our students. In the past, we used foreign paper for calculations and copying foreign texts. But now the exercise books produced by Tianzhang Paper Factory are very usable. The China National Products Company sells them for about 18 cents per dozen, which is much cheaper than foreign products. I usually use this kind of notebook for writing Chinese and Western texts or calculations, and I feel very at ease and happy because it is a domestic product. I really can't think of a good reason why we abandon usable domestic goods and use foreign goods. What is even more heartbreaking is that the intellectual class is still like this, let alone others?</p>
<p>How do we know that most of us are still using foreign goods? The most powerful evidence is that a domestic paper factory in Shanghai recently stopped production. Paper is considered to be the most closely related to students. Foreign paper is selling well and domestic paper factories are closing down during the Student Domestic Goods Year. This is the supreme shame for us students!</p>
<h3>Domestic Silk</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Due to the improvement of foreign silkworm breeding methods and the incentives for exported goods, our silk, which is known as a major export trade item, has almost no foothold in the world market. In addition, Chinese people love to wear imported woolen fabrics, and the continuous import of rayon has also caused domestic sales to plummet. If we don't think of ways to remedy this situation urgently, then not only will domestic silk disappear from the market, but there will also be no more mulberry planting and silkworm breeding in the countryside. Wouldn't this be another calamity for the production sector? Therefore, as citizens, although we cannot immediately regain the dominance of the silk industry, we should at least produce and use it ourselves to the greatest extent possible, and no longer allow imported woolen fabrics and silk fabrics to occupy their domestic position. Now, let's talk about the advantages of domestic silk so that people can consider it.</p>
<p>The so-called domestic silk naturally refers to that woven from silk. Anything woven from rayon or mixed with rayon is certainly not a qualified domestic product and cannot be called domestic. The advantages of domestic silk are that everyone knows it is strong, durable, and inexpensive. It is certainly more expensive than rayon, but much cheaper than pure silk fabrics from abroad. There are several scientific aspects: (1) Suitable for body weight. (2) Resistance to direct ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>It is important to know that the ratio of clothing to body weight is also of great importance. Humans can keep warm and feel comfortable when wearing clothes that weigh one-tenth of their body weight. Of course, if the weight of the clothes is too great, there will be various losses, such as shortness of breath when walking, inconvenience in doing things, and easy congestion. The weight of silk is lighter than any clothing material (whether cotton weave, hemp weave, or wool weave), but its ability to keep out the cold is greater. A silk cotton robe weighing only two or three catties is warmer than an old sheepskin robe weighing seven or eight catties, which is clear evidence. Therefore, the lightness, warmth, and hygiene of domestic silk are unmatched by any clothing material.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays are very important for human health; however, according to hygienists, "Excessive absorption is as unpleasant as excessive sunbathing and is also harmful to health." Rayon and kapok are most able to pass ultraviolet rays, while natural silk has the greatest absorption rate. Therefore, we must also wear domestic silk to regulate the direct radiation of ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>Okay! Since domestic silk has the above-mentioned advantages, fashionable people, hygienic people, and even economical people (because it is strong and easy to wash) might as well promote it more!</p>
<h3>Introducing a Newly Emerging Shunchang Porcelain Factory</h3>
<p>— Ru Yu</p>
<p>The development of China's porcelain industry has a very long history. Especially by the 13th century, its development not only reached its peak, but was also more powerful than that of any European country. For example, the famous German geographer Richthofen, who traveled in China for many years, left a book describing Chinese handicrafts very clearly. He said, "The technology of Chinese handicrafts has reached such a high level that every craftsman has his own automatic working machine, which is much higher than in Europe... Each department has a strict division of labor." Wok also said, "Each worker has his own special technology and his own special skills. One person paints birds, another paints flowers; one person adds red pigment, another adds blue color; counting up, until it is manufactured and sold, each piece of porcelain has to go through the hands of fifty workers."</p>
<p>The development of China's porcelain industry, the high level of technology, has reached this level, and it also has a very long history. In theory, China's porcelain industry should have the potential to develop by leaps and bounds and permanently hold the leading position in world porcelain production. However, turning to the customs trade booklets, not to mention other trade deficits, just looking at the annual import of porcelain alone, the number has reached an alarming figure and is increasing rather than decreasing. If this situation is not remedied urgently, the import of foreign porcelain cannot be stopped, and it will inevitably take over the original position of China's porcelain industry and squeeze the old Chinese porcelain industry out of the market. Looking at the trading situation of Jingdezhen porcelain, which is famous at home and abroad in recent years, it is not difficult to imagine its future. Therefore, improving China's porcelain industry at this time is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai had no manufacturing business of this kind, and it is really a pity and a pain to hand over such a good market to foreigners. Now, some people feel that this situation is getting more and more dangerous, so they set up a porcelain factory - Shunchang Porcelain Factory - at all costs to remedy it. Its scale is still in its initial stages, so it is not very large, there are very few workers, and the equipment is also very simple, but the raw materials used are all domestic products, and the porcelain styles are specially updated, and most of them are manufacturing the kind of foreign-style utensils that are imported from foreign countries. The progress of its future is naturally self-evident. This can be roughly understood by looking at the situation that orders from other factories are coming in one after another and they are too busy to handle them.</p>
<p>Shunchang Porcelain Factory has started to move forward in the face of this situation of promoting domestic goods and the flooding of foreign goods. It may also encounter obstacles in the middle. But I think that as long as the Chinese people adhere to their determination to supply and use domestic goods and persist in promoting domestic goods and rejecting foreign porcelain, not only can the Shunchang Porcelain Factory grow and develop, but also China's old porcelain industry will gradually improve. Therefore, I not only hope that Shunchang Porcelain Factory will work hard to improve and develop. I also hope that the Chinese people can unanimously maintain this industry that has just begun to blossom and bear fruit, so as to recover the lost rights and interests.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Wrong Characters and Correct Characters</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan advocated writing correct characters. He believed that people who write vernacular Chinese should have a thorough understanding of "primary school," so that they would not write characters incorrectly. His aim was not small, because he wanted to use this to overthrow vernacular Chinese and bring back classical Chinese. The fatal killer is "primary school."</p>
<p>Being able to have a thorough understanding of "primary school" and carefully study dictionaries and exegesis, just like an antique dealer who is good at identifying old goods and knows their origins, is indeed very good. However, antiques are still antiques. They are only for appreciation, just for display. Perhaps they are still useful to people who want to study ancient social situations, but they have nothing to do with current life. Therefore, the Zhou Ding is still the Zhou Ding, but the things used to pass on the country, decoct medicine, brew tea, and burn incense have all changed their names and appearances. The reason is to meet the needs of life: convenience, precision.</p>
<p>The same is true of writing. The Greater Seal Script of the Zhou Dynasty was very civilized and convenient at that time, but now, elegant people ask Mr. Taiyan to write couplets and hang them in their studies for decoration only. What we use in our daily lives is regular script that has undergone several changes, and there are simplified characters and wrong characters that are changing day by day.</p>
<p>The needs of life determine these things, and no one can do anything about it.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of the gentlemen in the Zhangshi Weekly Lectures, what Mr. Taiyan advocated is the correct character, that is, the "contemporary character" mentioned in the Kangxi Dictionary, not the ancient character. However, there are many characters in the Kangxi Dictionary that we do not use now. What "time" is "contemporary"?</p>
<p>If it is not now, then it only counts as the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Taiyan said in his article "The Relationship Between Vernacular and Classical Chinese":</p>
<p>"Common auxiliary words, such as yan zai hu ye, are not used in vernacular Chinese now, but hu and ye are still used. For example, when you meet an acquaintance and greet them, you say 'hao ya,' ya is the same as hu; when you respond to someone's compliment, you say 'shi ai,' ai is the same as ye. The word fu is used at the end of a sentence in classical Chinese, such as 'bi zi zhi yan fu,' which is the same as ba in vernacular Chinese, with a slight change in pronunciation. Yi changes to li, and the character of Lvsheng in Shuowen, or from the sound of li, can prove this example. The four characters hu ye fu yi have only changed slightly in sound, and logically we should use hu ye fu yi, not ya ai ba li."</p>
<p>It turns out that the "ya ai ba li" that we usually consider to be correct characters are, according to Mr. Taiyan's discovery, actually fabricated wrong characters. Isn't this enough to make those of us who oppose wrong characters feel lost? However, are we going to correct these wrong characters and follow Mr. Taiyan to "hu ye fu yi," or are we going to continue to accommodate spoken language and let it "ya ai ba li" go wrong?</p>
<p>If victory belongs to the latter, then the problem of correct characters and wrong characters is not difficult to solve. Because writing represents or supplements the shortcomings of language, then we should of course require it to accommodate spoken language and make the sound and mouth completely similar. As long as the "sound and mouth" can be "completely similar," it doesn't matter what correct or wrong characters are.</p>
<h3>Traveling Through the Gorges (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Fang Wu</p>
<p>Along the road, the azure river continuously crashes against the cliffs, creating snowy white splashes, making one's heart feel extraordinarily relaxed and refreshed. Flocks of brown water birds on the river, seeing people coming, fly up to the cliffs in waves, disappearing into the lush green foliage. Sometimes they suddenly swoop down again, skimming lively across the water, emitting joyful calls. How could a traveler feel depressed here, even if unpleasant anxieties were occupying their mind?</p>
<p>At a bend in a hillside, beneath a few ash trees, right next to the river, lies a large rock. Sitting on it is a man in a short black cloth jacket, dangling his feet in the river, leisurely washing them—or rather, playing with them. His expression seems strangely carefree. As soon as my companion saw him, he stopped whistling, raised his hand, as if reporting in, and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>After another shout, the man slowly turned his face, squinted his right eye, widened his left, carefully looked at us, and responded:</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Immediately, he lowered his head, straightened one leg out of the water, and lazily rubbed it with his hand, as if deliberately pretending to be unconcerned.</p>
<p>"Is it... just one?"</p>
<p>"Just one."</p>
<p>"Will it rain?"</p>
<p>"No way!"</p>
<p>"Is there wind coming from that side?"</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>While my companion was exchanging coded language with the man, he casually threw the bundle on his back by the roadside and nodded to me, saying:</p>
<p>"Rest for a while!"</p>
<p>The tone was somewhat like a command, not as polite as it had been in the morning. I had no choice but to mechanically sit down. Seeing a clod of earth exposed in his loosened bundle, I immediately understood into whose hands I had fallen. Because I understood that petty thieves, in order to avoid suspicion on the road, always use some worthless items to make their bundles look large.</p>
<p>When the man took his other foot out of the water, he reached into his pocket for a rolled cigarette, put one in his mouth, offered another to my companion, and another to me, while squinting his eyes, showing a mocking tone as he smiled:</p>
<p>"Have one, you've worked hard to get here, you've really suffered!... "</p>
<p>"It's nothing really? It's the stomach driving me along!"</p>
<p>I tried my best to appear calm, but I couldn't help but feel my heart racing.</p>
<p>"Easy now, your boss is after the big money!"</p>
<p>The man burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Seeing my companion reaching out to pull the bundle beside me, he shook the hand holding the cigarette at him and said:</p>
<p>"Slow down!"</p>
<p>A cruel, yet somewhat self-amused expression appeared on his face. A scar on his neck showed a red hue. Then, smiling, he calmly said to me:</p>
<p>"Friend, do you understand? We're not unreasonable—I must tell you... In this place, whatever anyone has the ability to take is theirs... That bundle (pointing with the hand holding the cigarette at the bundle containing the clod of earth), the cigarette in my pocket... (then taking a puff of the cigarette self-satisfactorily) and there is still some treasure over there (pointing to the leather clump under the weeping willow by the slope)...all depend on your skills…"</p>
<p>Following that, he narrowed his eyes, tilted his head back, and smiled mischievously. The cigarette was stuck on the corner of his mouth, just like an anti-aircraft gun, aiming straight at the sky. Before I could say anything, my companion had already put his words into action, snatching my bundle and opening it. Of course, they had the ability to take my things here and claim them as their own.</p>
<p>Seeing nothing of value inside the bundle, my companion crooked his mouth with the cigarette pipe in it and, without a word, picked up the curled books and ragged clothes, held them two or three feet off the ground, and then suddenly threw them all down, stretching out his dry nose with an air of careful inspection.</p>
<p>The man, who had appeared quite imposing, suddenly became uncomfortable and immediately took the cigarette from his mouth, glared at me, and waved his hand, but still tried to maintain a non-angry expression.</p>
<p>"Friend, let us search you!"</p>
<p>As I pulled my unbuttoned shirt back to cover my chest, the man turned his glaring eyes to my companion (who by this time looked panicky), stared for a while, then flicked off some ash with his finger, curled the corner of his mouth, and scolded regretfully:</p>
<p>"Don't you have eyes, you bumpkin!... Go back to playing with your mud."</p>
<p>My companion, his face flushed red, looked at me angrily and muttered in defense.</p>
<p>"Ugh... Damn it, he even said himself he was going to buy goods, I..."</p>
<p>The man suddenly rolled his eyes and, before he could finish speaking, nimbly jumped behind me, shouting:</p>
<p>"Oh, the cunning fellow, you must have hidden it in the leather."</p>
<p>At the same time, he pushed me aside and immediately explored the place where I had just been sitting with his feet.</p>
<p>I retreated in alarm, stammering to defend myself, while also showing a bit of the primal anger that emerges when one is in danger.</p>
<p>"What do I have? Nothing at all, if you're reasonable, you should go to those with money…"</p>
<p>Seeing that I really had nothing and hearing me say this, the man suppressed the anger that had just erupted, only to retort:</p>
<p>"Okay, then why did you lie to him that you were buying goods? Tell me, why?"</p>
<h3>Childhood Companions</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>After three years of separation from a companion, one must "look at them with new eyes." How much more so with childhood companions, after a separation of more than ten years? In the process of these ten-odd years (people's affairs cannot withstand such a long period of change), many of those who sat on the same bench in elementary school, who were classmates in the same classroom for three or four years, or who played together at the same school for one or two years, have now all changed in my memory, and changed in a way that surprises me so much that I can't even believe they were my former classmates.</p>
<p>Some old companions also make me think of the feelings evoked by Mr. Feng Zikai's cartoon "Elementary School Classmates."</p>
<p>Once, I saw on the street a classmate who used to attend general courses in the same classroom. Now he was carrying a night soil bucket, holding a dung broom in one hand, swaying his body as he carried a load across the street. Some others opened tofu shops, noodle shops, and wonton shops in the local area. Affected by society, they have long abandoned the state of mind they had when they were studying. Life relentlessly weighs them down, and they struggle painfully. I have always sympathized with them. The various bad customs and habits of society harm those companions who are struggling in life.</p>
<p>I personally saw a female classmate, who was only sixteen years old, and used to attend the same school as me, marry a local gangster and give birth to a large group of children. I dare not think about the pain in her life. I heard when I returned to my hometown the year before last that this woman had already died.</p>
<p>In addition, some old companions now all have solid university diplomas. New Western suits flutter on the streets of their hometown. Knowing full well that I remember fighting with them in elementary school, and playing together morning and night, they now dare not "acknowledge" that I am their classmate. It is obvious that sitting on the same bench, we can't have a very engaging conversation.</p>
<p>They no longer have the same perspective as before, and they have long since replaced their former innocent and amiable hearts. Who would be willing to look back at a poor friend who sells his mouth and his writing?</p>
<p>Those past companions already live in several different worlds from me. There are also some who have become worldly-wise, with a hypocritical face. They understand the various philosophies of dealing with the world: perfunctoriness, taking advantage of convenient situations, singing high-sounding tunes, speculating, and learning a glib tongue. Whenever I see them, I always hate them for exchanging pleasantries about the weather and saying a set of utterly painless, hypocritical words. I can only remain silent and willingly show weakness. I have never been able to learn that "philosophy of dealing with the world" well.</p>
<p>Whenever I think of those past companions in my hometown, I always feel particularly sad and lonely. They (she) all live in different worlds from me. Each person walks on a very different road. Each person's thoughts and opinions will not converge. Everyone looks at the world with different eyes. Perhaps we will never walk together again.</p>
<p>Bless those past companions of mine!</p>
<h3>Tragedy by the Sea (Part Four)</h3>
<p>— Original by French Author Balzac, Translated by Wang Jiansheng</p>
<p>"Her hair is like that of a fairy. If you ask her, 'Tell me, Pirout' (that is what we call Pirouette, she got her name from Saint Pirouette. Chabrame's first name is Pierre, he is her godfather)—tell me, Pirout', he continued, 'what does Uncle say to you?' She will answer me like this: 'He said nothing to me. —Never—nothing,' 'Well, what did he do?' Always on Sundays he kisses me on the forehead.' 'Then you are not afraid?' 'Why should I be afraid,' she says, 'he is my godfather.' He does not want anyone but me to bring him food."</p>
<p>"Pirout says that when she comes, he also smiles a little, but you might as well say it's like a flash of sunlight in the sea mist, because people say he is as gloomy as a storm."</p>
<p>"But," I said, "you have aroused our curiosity without satisfying it. Do you know what brought him to this state? Is it deep sorrow or repentance? Or madness? Or sin? Is it..."</p>
<p>"Ah, sir, no one understands the bottom line of this matter except my father and me. My mother, who is now dead, was a maid in the home of a judge. Chabrame told the judge the whole story. The people of the port say that the monks who confessed him only gave him certificates of redemption for their confessions. My poor mother, because the judge's parlor was next to the kitchen, overheard Chabrame's conversation unintentionally. She heard about this in the past, and now she is dead, and the judge also heard about this, and now he is also dead. My mother repeatedly told us—my father and me—never to reveal this matter to the residents here, but I can tell you this, I was really horrified that night my mother told us."</p>
<p>"Then tell us this story, my friend! We will never mention it to anyone."</p>
<p>The fisherman looked at us and continued to tell us: "Pierre Chabrame, the one you saw there, is the eldest of the Chabrame family. They have been sailors for generations. From their names, you can know that the sea is often under their control. The one you saw is a fisherman. He has his own skills. He has many small boats. He often rows to catch sardines. He even catches deep-sea fish for fishmongers. If he didn't love his wife so much, he would have built a boat to catch sharks. His wife used to be a beautiful woman, from the Brang region of Courondée—she used to be very glorious—and very kind-hearted. She loved her husband very much, so she never allowed him to leave for a longer period than catching sardines. They lived over there—over there," the fisherman said, after indicating a small island wedged between the dunes and the Courondée marshes away from the seaside, he went up a small hill. "Do you see that house? That's his house. Jacques-Quitte Brang and Chabrame only have one child, a boy. They love him very much—to what extent? —Madam! In short, like an only child. They loved him madly. If their little Jacques-Quitte randomly put something in their soup, forgive me, sirs, they would definitely say it made it taste better. We saw them buying the finest toys for their child in the market. I don't know how many times! Everyone told them it was a stupid thing. Little Chabrame soon realized he could do whatever he wanted, so when he grew up, he would do anything evil. If anyone went to his father and said, 'Your son almost put someone's child to death!' he would just laugh and say, 'Ah! He will definitely be a successful sailor in the future. One day he will be able to command the Emperor's warships.' Or another person would say, 'Pierre Chabrame, do you know that your son has blinded little Mésange's girl?' 'Here will be a boy who deals with girls,' Pierre said. This child had not the slightest flaw in his father's mind, so when he was ten years old, this young beast would fight everyone he met; he had twisted chicken necks for the game and cut open pig bellies. I dare say he really wallowed in blood like a cat! 'He will become a glorious soldier,' Chabrame said. 'He already has a bit of a homicidal habit.'"</p>
<h3>Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>When silent, a cry of loneliness attacks the heart, tightly gripping it. I look at anything in front of me and laugh alone like a child, but the laughter is so light that I can't even hear it myself. Naturally, I don't lack opportunities to interact with people and be in the midst of excitement, but when I am alone in silence, those contrived appearances, deceptive words, and false smiles flash before my eyes one by one. I try hard to avoid them, but I can't. They stubbornly float before my eyes, and in this way, the feeling of loneliness attacks me. Indeed, I understand that this is a very ordinary thing and that there is no need to revisit it so childishly. Many people have obtained warmth and sustenance through deception and contrivance, and many people have obtained comfort through deception and contrivance. People live by hiding a corner of their soul. Therefore, there is no one who is not lonely.</p>
<p>Every time I suffer alone like a child, secretly blaming others for not deceiving me so much and being so hypocritical towards me, I can't help but smile slightly to myself. This is obviously a smile to comfort myself, but before that smile has subsided, I still feel lonely, and my heart is suffering. I hear people say many comforting words and encouraging words to me, and give me many kind smiles. When those smiles are still lingering in my ears, each person's soul is already so far away, and their actions are also so far away.</p>
<p>People live on so lonely.</p>

<h3>Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Dr. Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>The causes of this disease are generally due to excessive physical labor, excessive mental work, smoking, alcoholism, seminal emission, masturbation, gonorrhea, and excessive indulgence in sexual desire, etc.</p>
<p>This disease is divided into cerebral neurasthenia and spinal neurasthenia. In cerebral neurasthenia, the symptoms are often headache, heaviness of the head, blurred vision, tinnitus, insomnia, forgetfulness, dramatic emotional changes, loss of appetite, and inability to engage in mental work. In spinal neurasthenia, the common symptoms are feeling tired upon waking up in the morning, muscles in the lower body easily feeling fatigued when walking, unusual sensations in the lower limbs from time to time, and the most obvious symptom is frequent pain in the sacral region. In addition, there are those with premature ejaculation and impotence, which are all signs of sexual neurasthenia.</p>
<p>To treat this disease, in addition to the patient needing to eliminate the inducing causes of the disease, the health of the living environment is also very important, such as—choosing the most convenient and practical methods, such as moderating work and rest, exercising properly, establishing regular eating times, avoiding irregular living, having proper thoughts, ceasing sexual desires, being cautious in socializing, and choosing appropriate nutritional products to ensure that the body and mind achieve tranquility and freedom. Everyone knows that phosphorus is one of the main drugs for treating this disease because phosphorus is an essential medicine for tonifying the nerves. If the human body consumes too much phosphorus, it must seek adequate supplementation. There are many phosphorus preparations for replenishing the nervous system sold on the market, but the only one I appreciate in clinical practice is An Er Shen because that medicine contains particularly strong phosphorus and does not have any drawbacks, making it easy for weakened nerves to return to normal. The lecithin that is so popular nowadays, namely egg yolk phospholipid, is known to be used for quitting smoking, but it is not known that it is actually much more effective for this disease than for quitting smoking. If significant sexual neurasthenia is present, then endocrine hormone preparations are an indispensable supplement. In addition to drug treatment, electromedical therapy also has considerable value, but when seeking medical treatment, the patient's own treatment is also indispensable, and it is necessary to discard worldly affairs to allow the body and mind to achieve absolute freedom. Then, no matter how serious the condition, it is not difficult to return to normal. (Editor's note: Mr. Feng Shanliang is experienced in the study of nervous system disorders and is known as an expert. The An Er Shen he uses is a specialized agent for treating neurasthenia. Distributor: Ren Shou Pharmacy, No. 1 Lao De Hang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. Price: $1.50 per bottle, plus postage for mail orders.)</p>
<h3>Nervous Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>— Dr. She Lei</p>
<p>Excessive stomach acid, chronic persistent gastric juice leakage, and periodic persistent gastric juice leakage can all cause abnormal gastric secretion nerves, thereby causing stomach pain. However, there are many causes of nervous stomach pain, not just the above-mentioned ones. For example, abnormalities in the gastric motor nerves and sensory nerves can also cause this disease. This article only discusses excessive stomach acid. Excessive stomach acid means that the acidity of the stomach contents is greater than normal. Sometimes organic changes in stomach diseases can also cause this disease, which will not be discussed in detail here. The causes of this disease are generally due to chronic intestinal diseases, bile secretion disorders, reproductive organ disorders, excessive smoking and drinking, and prolonged consumption of irritants. In addition, mental fatigue and depression are also inducing factors for this disease. Patients often feel discomfort in the stomach, pressure, and stomach pain. Stomach pain usually occurs two to three hours after eating. In addition, there are acid reflux, heartburn, and acidic belching. The characteristic of this disease is that it is immediately relieved by taking alkaline agents. The most important thing in the dietary therapy of this disease is fat. Fat can reduce acidity and is also the most effective nutritional product for weak patients. Among fatty foods, milk is the best. Other foods that can irritate the gastric mucosa and enhance gastric acid secretion are all prohibited. In terms of mechanical therapy, gastric lavage is quite effective. Saline and sodium bicarbonate water can be used. For severe cases, silver nitrate water is used. It must be done on an empty stomach in the early morning. In terms of electrical therapy, shortwave diathermy is the best. In terms of drug treatment, the only things that can normalize secretions and neutralize excess acid to achieve the purpose of pain relief are alkaline agents. Among alkaline agents, the most perfect and harmless one is Wei Bao, appreciated by Dr. Ma Fangweng. This product does not contain toxic painkillers and can be effective in a short time. It is truly an ideal stomach pain medicine. Some say that opium can relieve pain and reduce acidity, but they do not know that although it reduces it at first, it later increases the acidity, which is less than that of hyoscyamus. Regarding this, just look at those who suffer from stomach diseases and are addicted to smoking, who still suffer from stomach diseases from time to time, and you can understand. (Editor's note: Wei Bao costs $2 per box and is a specially made agent for treating stomach pain. Mr. Ma Fangweng has been using it for a long time and needs no further explanation. Distributor: Ren Shou Pharmacy, No. 1 Lao De Hang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. Dr. She Lei is an expert in internal medicine and gastroenterology. He is particularly experienced in the study of the effects of opium on the human body. His reputation has been established for a long time. There is a constant stream of people seeking his help to quit smoking. He has the reputation of being a saint of quitting smoking.)</p>
<h3>Acute Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>After an incubation period of about two to five days after contracting gonorrhea, the initial symptoms are discovered. Sometimes they may be slightly earlier or later. Once the initial symptoms appear, the sensation in the urethral opening, the navicular fossa, and the area tightly connected to the glans is slightly abnormal. There is occasional mild itching. The glans feels warm, and there is a sensation like ants crawling. The penis feels heavy and tense. The navicular fossa and perineum may have stabbing pains. The spermatic cord and testicles may be pulled and ache dully. Inflammation inside the urethra is not enough to induce sexual excitement, so the penis often erects, and urination is frequent. Each time you urinate, it feels warmer than usual. The pain is worse after urination. After about two to four days, the labia of the urethral opening gradually swell, resulting in a kind of luster. The mucous membrane of the urethral opening turns red, followed by papillae protruding. At this time, if you squeeze the urethral opening up and down with your thumb and forefinger, you will see a small amount of viscous liquid leaking out. If you don't have it after urinating for a while, the viscous liquid will stick to the two lips of the urethral opening and close it. When urinating, the previous sensation of heat is now burning. If you test the urine, you will see things mixed in that look like silk or snow. These are all mixtures of epithelial mucus and pus cells. Then the inflammation becomes more severe. The urethral mucosa swells. Secretion is also becoming more severe. The base of the glans and the navicular fossa all develop tenderness. There is frequent urgency to urinate. Every urination is painful and burning. A large amount of pus is secreted from the urethral opening. When treating this disease, in addition to absolute rest and abstinence from irritating foods, drug therapy is required. Silver preparations are commonly used externally for sterilization. But the one that is recommended now is Lindu Shuyao Er. For internal use, Meisha Lin from Mei Ling Western Firm is recommended. Among the injectable pigments, An De Xue Qing and Tuo Lü Pa Fu Laven are the best. Among the vaccines, mixed serum vaccine is superior. The direct tube shortwave electrotherapy machine and the latest turbid therapy machine are especially effective for acute gonorrhea. (Editor's note: Lindu Shuyao Er and Meisha Lin are both exclusively sold by Ren Shou Pharmacy, No. 1 Lao De Hang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. Meisha Lin costs $1 per box, and Lindu Yao Shu Er costs $2.50 per can. Add postage for mail orders.)</p>
<h3>Eczema</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>Eczema is a type of inflammatory skin disease, characterized by itchy skin inflammation. The affected skin area is red and swollen, with small blisters, papules, or pustules appearing on it. This eczema may be scattered or clustered, and the skin surface is often moist and crusty. Eventually, scales fall off, gradually leading to healing. If it persists without treatment, the skin may become infiltrated and thickened, becoming chronic. Auspitz described eczema as a superficial catarrhal disease of the skin. There are two causes of this disease: (1) External causes, such as chemical, thermal, or mechanical irritation; (2) Internal causes, such as adenopathy, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, and nervous system disorders. Menstrual irregularities, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, anemia, and weakened individuals are also at risk of developing this condition. From onset to complete cure, the condition can be divided into six stages based on its presentation: 1. Erythematous stage: The skin is red and swollen. 2. Papular stage: Papules appear due to cell infiltration, causing itching. 3. Vesicular stage: In addition to cell infiltration, plasma exudation occurs, accumulating under the stratum corneum to form blisters containing watery, transparent fluid. 4. Pustular stage: The contents become turbid due to the presence of pus cells in the blisters. 5. Moist or Crusty stage: The blister or pustule membranes rupture due to scratching or friction, and the pus drains out, forming a crust. 6. Scaling stage: This is when the eczema is completely healed. For external medication, MISULZINE is the best, as it can penetrate deep into the skin layers and exert a powerful antibacterial effect. This medicine does not stain clothes and has a pleasant scent, making it truly an ideal skin remedy. Available at: Ren Shou Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Road, Baixianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai. Price: One yuan per box, plus one yuan for postage. Dr. Wu Sheng, a skin disease specialist, frequently uses this medicine in his practice, demonstrating its value.</p>

<p>Method for Complete Cure</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Yu Yifang): I have suffered from liver qi pain for seven years. It recurs every year. I have sought medical attention and purchased medicine, but neither has prevented recurrence. I wonder if there is a method for complete cure for this condition. Because it is inconvenient for me to seek medical treatment, I would like you to recommend a good medicine that I can use for self-treatment.</p>
<p>Answer: Your condition is most likely chronic gastritis. It would be best to consult with a specialist physician for diagnosis and treatment. As for oral medication, "WEABO" is the only effective choice. This medicine has been repeatedly used in clinical practice by doctors Nyle and Ma Fangweng and is highly recommended. If you can take it according to the instructions and control your diet, it should not be difficult to achieve a complete cure. This medicine is currently sold at Ren Shou Pharmacy, located at No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Road, Baixianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai. The price is one yuan per box, plus one yuan for postage.</p>
<p>Twice in One Night</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Zhang Shuhou): In the past, I engaged in masturbation, but only briefly, and I have quit for a long time. However, since then, I have suffered from nocturnal emissions, occurring several times a month, or even once every two or three days, sometimes even twice in one night. I know that this is caused by sexual neurasthenia. I plan to go to Feng Shanliang, a doctor at the Chunzai Hospital at No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, for diagnosis and treatment. However, I am limited by economic constraints, time, work, and other aspects of life. Even if there is a famous doctor, I can only sigh with regret. I humbly request that you recommend an inexpensive and effective medicine that I can use for self-treatment.</p>
<p>Answer: "AROLSEN" is a good medicine for your condition. Each bottle costs only one yuan and fifty cents and can be taken for ten days. Why not purchase it? This medicine is available at Ren Shou Pharmacy, located at No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Road, Baixianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Addicted to Smoking</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Ling Wenyuan): I became addicted to smoking because I was physically weak and often coughed. When coughing severely, there was blood in my phlegm. Now I want to quit, but I don't know how to do it. Which doctor has experience and is reliable in treating and helping people quit smoking?</p>
<p>Answer: During the smoking cessation period, it is necessary to eliminate any underlying illnesses and provide appropriate nutritional supplements. Only in this way can the goal of quitting smoking be achieved effectively; otherwise, there will be no good results. As for choosing a doctor, any internist is fine. Dr. She Lei at Chunzai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, is a skilled internist and has extensive experience in smoking cessation. The method is very innovative, using a combination of serum ovovitellin and "Cibao Ming" to not only eliminate smoking addiction but also provide nutrition. Countless individuals have successfully quit under his care. If you are determined to quit, you can consult with him.</p>
<p>Chunzai Hospital</p>
<p>Two months ago, I contracted gonorrhea and was treated and cured at the Chunzai Hospital at No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession. Urine tests at the laboratory showed no gonorrhea bacteria. However, my wife has had leucorrhea at the same time, but she refuses treatment and has delayed until now. Please recommend an effective medicine (Question from Mr. Xu Jinqiu).</p>
<p>Answer: It is likely that your wife has contracted gonorrhea. It is best to seek medical attention for an examination and then receive treatment accordingly. Since your condition was cured at Chunzai Hospital, you can consult with Dr. Liu Xuannv at the hospital regarding your wife's condition. Dr. Liu is skilled in treating gynecological and uterine diseases and has considerable experience. As for medicine, you can use MESALSROPIN for oral administration and purchase GONO-SERLO for external use. These two products are excellent for treating gonorrhea and can be used by both men and women. The former costs one yuan per box, and the latter costs two yuan and fifty cents per can, plus one yuan for postage. They are currently sold at Ren Shou Pharmacy, located at No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Road, Baixianqiao, French Concession, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Preparing Labor Insurance</h3>
<p>— Qiongsheng</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Special Dispatch): The Ministry of Industry is preparing for labor insurance and has drafted a Labor Insurance Law, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and will be sent to the Central Political Committee for review. It is expected to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation early next month. The principle of the law is to protect the lives of workers and adopts a compulsory system. Insurance types are divided into two categories: injury insurance and health insurance.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is a welcome measure for Chinese workers, whose lives are not guaranteed at all. Workers in society are the main creators of modern people's welfare and wealth, but their lives are often tragic among the people. Therefore, after many scholars' advocacy and workers' own struggles in the nineteenth century, most civilized countries have now established labor social insurance. Moreover, many countries have incorporated it into their constitutions as a major part of government policy.</p>
<p>The only thing that general industrialists pay attention to is the acquisition of profits, and they rarely pay attention to the improvement of labor conditions and safety facilities. The number of conflicts between laborers and employers due to such events is difficult to count. However, when it comes to Chinese industry, it is originally miserable to mention. The industry itself is not developed, so how can it withstand the exploitation of capitalists from various countries? Therefore, it is extremely difficult for general industrialists to obtain their own profits, let alone provide relief to workers when they are sick. Now that it is protected by labor insurance, it can be considered a great merit and a blessing for people's livelihood, no matter what.</p>
<p>However, although the main form of "labor insurance" adopts the state's "compulsory system" to take advantage of the situation, its ultimate goal is to promote the improvement of the labor environment, pay attention to safety facilities, and establish strict labor hygiene equipment in the society. Therefore, in addition to the implementation of laws and regulations, we must also promote the entire society to enable workers to enjoy the happiness of "insurance."</p>
<p>What's more, labor insurance should not only pay attention to injuries and diseases, but also to cultural facilities, unemployment relief, bereavement compensation, and old-age care. Some people may think that the former two are the most important for China at present and must be carried out gradually. Then we will wait and see.</p>
<h3>Autumn Melody</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>From the slanting wind and drizzle permeating the gray sky, from every weary cicada chirp, from the sunlight that fades a little every day, summer is quietly fading away. Sitting by the window with my collar open, gazing at the crisscrossing streets spread out before me, a feeling of "another year, another autumn breeze" wells up in my heart. The clamor and turmoil of summer have subsided, allowing the wind and rain to end everything that once shone with glory and splendor. It is like attending a sad funeral, seeing only withered wreaths and silently moving rows of monks in black robes, hearing only mourning music, and inevitably adding a stroke or two of gloomy oil paint to the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I still remember last year in early autumn, when a few patches of clear sky appeared after the new rain, and white clouds piled up into strange peaks in the sky. On a whim, I went to the suburbs to find Spanish architecture that matched the mood of autumn. In the vast fields, here was a patch of unfaded green, and there were toy-like scarlet villas. Occasionally, on quiet tree-lined roads, I could see lonely and melancholy young women walking slowly, holding small parasols, drifting by like a dream. I would half-heartedly watch their backs disappear into the autumn forest with a touch of melancholy. But now, even that mood is gone. The house is quiet, the person is thin, the smoke rings exhaled from the mouth are pale, and the mood is indifferent. I don't want to think about anything, I just want to go to the countryside to see the clear autumn pool and the egret-feather-like reed catkins.</p>
<p>Here, besides hearing a few cries of ice vendors, there are relatively few traces of autumn. In the countryside, the situation is different. The fields are filled with undulating waves of ripe wheat, and the setting sun shines on the backs of cattle, creating a dazzling golden light. The small river flows by like a conch shell, and the smoke from the cooking fires in the bronze-colored sky transforms into magical characters. There are the rustling of leaves, the sound of raindrops hitting the grass and trees, the sound of weak oars, and the sound of insects buzzing under the starry sky. The peace of the countryside, the purity of the heart, and the beauty of the season compose a silent chapter. And I, I will sit under an old tree, smoking a peaceful pipe, and gaze intently at the picturesque fields in the evening. No one will pay attention to me, except for the familiar geese and dogs.</p>
<p>But this hope is difficult to realize. When I have nothing to do, I sometimes bring a useless book, a park ticket, and my own unchanging silent temperament, and linger in the autumn park. A tired atmosphere hovers over the poetic ponds, and the French sycamores tremble in the late summer breeze. Birds peck at the soil after the new rain. I smell the breath of autumn. In the scarlet light of the setting sun, I sit on a long chair and watch the white clouds chasing each other in the sky, watch the faces of the tourists dyed red by the sunset, watch the branches swaying, watch the banana peels left by others on the ground, and watch the book in my hand and the old streetcar ticket that I accidentally found in the book. It's all beautiful. The weather is no longer hot, but it's not too cool. In the lonely tranquility, I seem to hear autumn calling me, and my imagination unfolds like brocade. I imagine that autumn should have beautiful flowers, dreams woven by fireflies, crickets comforting my loneliness, sweet roasted chestnuts, round and ripe grapes, a clear sky that evokes imagination, and a sense of ease all over my body, like removing shackles. All these embellishments drive away the gloomy mood of the entire season. I look forward to a little refreshing wind and rain to see how autumn's magic hand will change the universe. I want to see the power of autumn.</p>
<p>My expectations have not been in vain. From the slanting wind and drizzle permeating the gray sky, from every weary cicada chirp, from the sunlight that fades a little every day, autumn has quietly come.</p>
<h3>Cicada</h3>
<p>— Erhe</p>
<p>Sitting in the shade of a tree reading in the evening, I often unconsciously think of Huang Zhongze's line of poetry: "Even when the cicada swallows its voice, it still has a sound." Actually, it is not without reason. Firstly, since returning to my hometown, I have been listening to the cicada's song every day, which is very annoying to others but very interesting to me. Secondly, that line of poetry really expresses the feeling of my own heart as I approach "middle age."</p>
<p>Indeed, I have a special interest in cicadas. When I was young, because I grew up in the countryside, cicadas were my good companions all day long every summer. Under the scorching sun, I pinched reed heads and searched for spider webs all day long. When the spider silk on the reed heads was very, very thick, I would raise my head and look for cicadas in the big trees. Every time, I would always glue many cicadas and keep them in a cage. When the cicadas were first put in the cage, they just wanted to fly, always bumping from this side to that side, from that side to this side. After a long time, they would settle down. Hanging them on the beams or bed frames, they would naturally sing. At that time, of course, I was extremely happy, but my parents often threw my cage outside the door. I hated it. I couldn't find a reason to throw the cage outside the door.</p>
<p>Because I knew that cicadas ate dew, I would hang the cage outside at night. In this way, often for many days, many days, the cicadas were still alive and still singing with high spirits. When I was tired of playing, I would open the cage and catch one or two of them and let them fly away into the distance. Or I would tie a cicada to each end of a line and let them fly. It was very difficult for them to fly, but for this reason, I felt very satisfied. Not only that, I also liked to put the shell of some kind of grass over the cicada's eyes and let it fly. It flew very, very high. Sometimes, when the wind blew the shell off its eyes, it would fly into the green forest as if it had been saved. If the shell remained on its eyes forever, it would fly upward, upward forever, but sometimes it would suddenly fall down, probably because it was too tired or dizzy.</p>
<p>My parents told me that if I did this, I would be blind in the next life, but in fact, I was not afraid of this. Really, this way of playing made me feel too interested.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Before the cicadas shed their shells, now I know to call it "cultivation." In the beginning, I only knew to call it "zhiliao". After every plum rain, the "cultivation" opens the mud, comes out of a small hole, and prepares to climb onto a tree to shed its shell. Because it was still early summer at that time, and the cicadas had not yet started singing, the "cultivation" was especially precious. Confined in the house, I only hoped that the plum rain would stop for a moment. When it stopped, I would go barefoot to find the small holes, carefully using my fingers to probe into each small hole like Columbus discovering a branch floating on the sea. After getting them, I would put them in a cage and wait for them to shed their shells, but it was never as good as gluing them with spider silk. Sometimes, when they had just shed half of their shell, I would become impatient and use my fingers to pull off the other half. As a result, the wings would always grow poorly. It was best to quietly sneak to every tree on a moonlit night, because at that time, there were often "cultivation" shedding their shells or already having shed their shells. The new cicada's wings had just grown well, and the color was pale lake blue, which was especially beautiful compared to those black-winged cicadas that were singing.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I also liked to find cicada shells. It was said that they could be used as medicine and sold to pharmacies in nearby towns. Although I never took them out to sell, I would always gather hundreds of pairs every summer and string them together with a thread into a long string, which was not as expensive as pearls when hung on the bamboo of the mosquito net, but it had the beauty of pearls.</p>
<p>However, I have already given these dreams to the next generation of children. In the evening, in the breeze of dusk, I no longer have the heart to guess the riddle that children are familiar with: "Living in the mud, climbing on the tall poplar, playing the flute in the daytime, drinking wine and enjoying the cool in the night." Hearing the cicada's song, I only unconsciously think of Huang Zhongze's line of poetry: "Even when the cicada swallows its voice, it still has a sound."</p>
<h3>In the Hospital</h3>
<p>— Ge Ren</p>
<p>When I woke up, the room was pitch black. So I reached behind me to turn on the light switch, but the place my fingers touched was a cold, hard wall, and my bed seemed to have been changed. This made me wonder if I was dreaming. I wanted to shout, because if I was really dreaming, I could suddenly wake up, or I could prove whether my suspicion was just overthinking. But the fact that my whole body was tied up like a soft rope, unable to move, was secondary to the fact that my throat was so blocked that I couldn't shout out a single word. So I opened my eyes and stared into the dark space, trying my best to calm myself down. I thought that there would always be some movement to confirm my current suspicions.</p>
<p>But the brain is something that can never be controlled by itself. Sometimes it is like a calm sea, and sometimes it is like a tumultuous sea. Now it was in such a situation. My mind was like a tangled mess of hemp, unable to find a beginning. Thinking of this and thinking of that, many forgotten, painful things vividly played out, without the slightest mercy, causing my body, which was tied up by a soft rope, to twitch painfully. My throat could no longer bear the pressure of that blockage. It was as if a breath of air was surging up from between my chest and brain, and it broke through that difficult pass. It turned out to be a cough. This made me completely think it over. When I got up this morning, I was a little agitated. I reluctantly wanted to go to the office, as if trying to squeeze onto a crowded streetcar. Squeezing and bumping, my legs softened. After that, perhaps I fainted. Then, I touched the cold, hard wall again with my hand, touched the edge of the bed, and touched my forehead. My forehead was burning like fire. Undoubtedly, after I fainted, I was moved to some place. After so many thoughts swirled in my mind, I calmed down. Actually, I already felt a faint pain in my temples. I could no longer think of anything. But since I had confirmed that I wasn't dreaming, where am I sleeping? I still wanted to know this second question. Since I couldn't move my body, my hands could still do a little work. I gathered my strength and knocked on the cold wall. Sure enough, a series of clicking leather shoe sounds came to my ears. When they stopped, the light in the room came on. "In the hospital," I immediately understood. The lady in white, wearing a white hat, shook her head at me with a pitying attitude. A thermometer, I could see it clearly, was placed under my tongue. I closed my eyes, because I thought of whether there would be any changes in my office after I, such a person, disappeared, which was the biggest problem for me.</p>
<p>The nurse checked the thermometer and told me that my temperature had dropped and that I would get better if I rested well. I wanted to wait for her to tell me something more, but she turned around and was about to leave. At that time, I called out rudely. "Who brought me to the hospital?" She first forbade me from speaking loudly, and then she told me the story as if she were telling a story: Several people brought you here this morning. They said you fainted at the streetcar station. After our doctor examined you, they found the place where you work in your pocket. They called and they replied that you are their employee, but she stared at me for a long time:</p>
<p>"They said you are single!"</p>
<p>She seemed to be waiting for me to answer with disbelief. The sincerity of a stranger excited me. I wanted to tell her the story that had just swirled in my mind, perhaps she could show me a little sympathy! But I nodded to her, gave her a smile, and closed my eyes, letting this story be preserved forever in my mind.</p>

Below, he had no soup to alleviate suffering. He could not obtain Heaven's grace, and people had no way to benefit from its dew. Every day, he watched and heard the toil, death, and complaints of the people. His virtue was exhausted, and he had nowhere to rely on. Therefore, he often spoke about the Dao. This was the great ambition of the sage, admitting no inquiries in between. His disciples either knew it or doubted it, unable to clearly transmit it to each other. Therefore, at the beginning of each chapter of his book, he stood firmly and solemnly.</p>

<p>Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber - Zijuan"</p>
<p>The moonlight slants on the azalea branches. Outside the window, cuckoos cry blood-stained sand. Little Zijuan's loyalty is as heavy as iron. She was originally a maidservant at Jia's mother's hall. Only because Lin Gu Ye was ill in Yangzhou, she accompanied the young lady to the canal office. Therefore, the mistress and servant have a deep affection like sisters. We pity you, cherish you, and you pity us. With her ice-like skin, jade-like bones, and clever nature, she is a flower in her prime at the age of fifteen or sixteen. She often accompanies Daiyu in the Xiao Xiang Pavilion. Sometimes, she earnestly advises the foolish Bao Yu to stop complaining and weeping. Sometimes, she prepares strong decoctions with a sigh. Sometimes, she idly listens to the parrot reciting poetry. Sometimes, she accompanies the beautiful girl alone, counting fallen flowers. Sometimes, she wipes the incense burner and speaks her heart. Sometimes, she holds a zither and asks for words while offering tea. Look at her, testing the foolish Bao Yu's infatuation. This is her pure loyalty and love for her mistress. Who knew the red thread would be secretly cut by others? The road to Mount Tiantai is distant, covered by white clouds. Later, the pearl sinks, the jade shatters, and the hairpins break. The beauty of youth is buried in the white sand. She feels that the foolish Bao Yu is not unfaithful, and she vows never to hold a pipa for the rest of her life. She accompanies Xichun, chanting Buddhist scriptures in the blue lamp, understanding the secular world and wishing to become a nun. The blue clothes and red sleeves are exchanged for a cassock.</p>

<p>Opening "Zhuang Zixiu" (General Outline)</p>
<p>Admirable Zhuang Zixiu in his days. His nature was born proud of nobles. He once served as a minor official in the melon garden. He removed his hat and retired to enjoy himself. In his dream, butterflies fluttered. Doubting if it's real or not, unrestrained. Waking up, he is still Zhuang Zhou. Whenever he meets noble and wise men, he thinks of asking them about the Tao. He met Laozi and the green ox in the clouds. Idly reading a volume of the Nanhua Jing. Roaming freely, strange autumn. Parables are nothing but illusions. Don't seek fame and profit for life. Hui Shi, a true confidant, came and went. They talked to each other with great spirits. Unexpectedly, his wife fell ill. Ginseng and Lingzhi were taken daily but were difficult to cure. The clothing, coffin, and outer coffin were prepared and placed in advance. He laughed loudly while singing a tune with a broken basin. Hui Shi didn't know what this meant. Why was the broken string not sad? Saying that it is good for her husband to bury her after death. She can avoid shame from the world for the rest of her life. When I die, my wife will definitely remarry. The fields, gardens, carriages, and horses will be taken by others. From now on, get rid of the burdens of the mortal world. From now on, my body will be like an unburdened boat. Vague, ethereal, and truly open-minded. Even if I don't become an immortal, I'll still be carefree. The blue sea and green mountains are free to roam. Wanting to find a companion like Chang Sang Gong. He is not similar to ordinary Taoists. How can he hope to refine pills and achieve immortality?</p>

<h3>Half a Week in Tianyi</h3>
<p>Reprint of "Mother" Sheet Music</p>
<p>Tianyi's new sound film "Mother" is about to be completed. Fan Xuepeng plays the role of the mother, and her acting skills have achieved great success. The film includes two new songs, "Mother Song" and "Farewell Song." Exquisite sheet music has already been printed and distributed to all sectors. The first edition of 7,000 copies was completely given away in less than ten days due to the large number of people requesting the music. They had to reprint it to meet the enthusiasm of those requesting the sheet music from all walks of life. (Address for requesting gifts: Propaganda Department of Tianyi Film Company, No. 232 Ganse Dong Road, French Concession, Shanghai)</p>
<p>Li Yihe Goes to Japan for Inspection</p>
<p>Li Yihe, the distribution director of the business department of Tianyi Company, recently went to Japan on the President Coolidge yesterday afternoon to inspect the film industry, because he saw that the domestic film industry was not prosperous, while the Japanese film industry was booming. He plans to conduct a thorough investigation of the film production situation and the current screening situation in Japan. It is said that he expects to stay in Japan for one month.</p>
<p>Lu Lixia is Out of Danger</p>
<p>Lu Lixia, a basic actress of Tianyi, recently gave birth in a hospital and was once in danger. People who admire Lu's art and friends in the circle have sent letters and telegrams of condolences and are very concerned about Lu's illness. According to Wang Yinmei's report to the company, Lu has been out of danger and gave birth to a boy a few days ago. However, due to excessive bleeding, she needs a longer period of recuperation. Therefore, I specially tell friends who care about Miss Lu truthfully.</p>
<p>Even a Fool Has a Fool's Luck</p>
<p>Ge Furong, the big man of Tianyi, recently had good luck and won a fifth prize in the aviation lottery, totaling fifty yuan. Ge was overjoyed, even more so than on the eve of his wedding. Everyone said that even a fool has a fool's luck.</p>
