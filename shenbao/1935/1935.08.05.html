<h3 id="c30">奧國復辟運動之國際關係 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>奧國復辟運動。年來時而高漲。時而消沉。殆莫不與德意之爭覇中歐有關。德國圖握中歐覇權。從而伸張其勢力於南歐。不得不先併呑奧國。此德奧合併之所以成爲第三帝國實施政綱之一也。意國欲與德爭覇。阻止德國勢力之南侵。必積極擴張其勢力於奧國。策動復辟。乃其實施此項政策之一種手段。故意國對奧急進。則奧國之復辟運動高漲。反之。則暫時消沉。去年七月。奧國發生政變。意卽援助史泰亨堡掌握奧國之實際政權。史泰亨堡爲法西斯主義之忠實信徒。又爲保皇黨之健將。其執政權不但有羅馬之背景。且爲使奧國復辟傾向日益濃厚之動力也。</p>
<p>最近德國廢棄凡爾賽和約之軍事條欵。實施强迫軍役制。英國破壞維持英法意對德聯合陣綫之諾言。與德國締結海軍恊定。而多腦河公約經數月間之談判。仍無成功希望。此種情勢足使德國勢力向外擴展。益增其氣燄。意國爲防止德國勢力南侵起見。乃竭力助長奧國內部之復辟運動。奧政府在意國策動之下。宣佈取銷放逐哈布斯堡皇室法律。及發還已經國家沒收之皇室財產。以爲實行復辟之準備。並以觀測歐陸各國對此運動之態度。蓋奧國復辟。非僅奧國之內政問題。亦一國際問題也。</p>
<p>與奧國復辟問題休戚有關之小協約國。及巴附幹半島各國。對奧國積極進行復辟。均具戒心。南國執政保羅親王日前馳赴羅國與國。王加羅爾協海嚴厲制止奧國復辟之方法。希臘陸長貢第利斯亦往訪南國。作同樣之磋商。捷克半官式報紙「捷克新聞」更發表官方授意之評論。不但反對奧國復辟。卽對沃都大公重返奧國。亦表示不滿。此等小國所以一致取如是態度者。良以如舊日奧匈帝國之幽靈重復出現。必致危及諸國之領土完整與政治獨立耳。</p>
<p>歐洲之英法兩强對於奧國復辟似亦深威不安。法國近方欲挾意以制德。奧國復辟一旦成功。固無異在多腦河對岸築成一道堤防。足以阻止德國向中歐之發展。但法國爲維持其在中歐之現有勢力。與在奧國之投資市塲起見。亦未甘讓意獨占奧國。而寧與小協約國保持原有之同盟國關係。故若言法國態度。可謂爲相對的反對奧國復辟。至於英國政策。素以光輝的孤立爲言。對於奧國內政。本無直接利害關係。但奧國復辟萬一成功。意國在中歐之勢力必有長足進展。對於英國在歐覇權。不無相當之威脅。故央國實乃消極的反對奧國復辟者。</p>
<p>國際關係之複雜。旣如上所述。奧國復辟如果成功。其必引起中歐更嚴重之糾紛殆無疑義。近數日來。意大利對甲歐政策尙未有充分之準備。故奧國復辟運動在表面上不但重又消沉。奧政府且認此種宣傳。在現階段之外交上。能妨碍政府自由行動。而密令制止國內之復辟運動。然此亦僅在意國專心於東菲期間。暫時緩和國際空氣之作用耳。</p>

<p>國聯會行政院决定不論何種情形、均當於一九三五年九月四日召集開會、俾就意阿關係之各方面作一總審查、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>第一决議案經全塲一致投票通過、無棄權者、第二决議案亦經一致通過、但意代表曾棄權未投票、</p>
<p>按第一决議案所指之一九二八年意阿條約、其中規定兩國間一切爭案應付仲裁、以二十年爲限、</p>
<p>此次會議、爲國聯歷史上最短者之一、僅歷四十五分鐘、由蘇俄外委李維諾夫主席、提出决議案、而請各代表表示意見（三日路透電）</p>
<p>意阿代表先後發言</p>
<p>阿國政府代表席士敎授首先起立宣稱、阿比西尼亞爲維持和平起見、不惜再作重大之犧牲、以接受行政院之决議案、俾阿國對於國聯會之誠　態度、於此史得一明證、抑阿國深信各仲裁委員對於阿國之正當要求、終必有充分認識之一日、今特向全世界聲明、阿國對於仲裁委員會所議决之任何公允方案、决定準備接受、此外阿比西尼亞希望行政院九月四日開會討論意阿間全部懸案、俾意阿兩國促成永久之友好關係」云、繼由意國代表阿洛錫發言、大意謂意大利贊成行政院第一决議案、至於第二决議案、規定由行政院於九月四日就意阿爭端作全盤考慮一層、則根據本國代表七月三十一日在行政院第一次會議時所發表之宣言、决定放棄投票云、（哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英法切望和平解決</p>
<p>阿洛錫發言畢、賴伐爾起立、首先申述談判之極度困　、繼謂第五仲裁委員任命之後、華爾華爾事件當能獲得最後之解决、此事當使至今依然信賴國聯者、獲得滿意也、最後彼以法國代表之資格聲稱、彼不獨並未視其工作已告完畢、同時更願竭其全力以謀和解之成立及和平之維持、</p>
<p>至此、艾登代表英國起立請各方對些二項决議案予以接受、並謂行政院通過此二項决議案後、彼將賡績努力、使意阿問題依照一九二八年之意阿條約、以仲裁辦法解决華爾華爾事件、今兩方對於委派第五仲裁委員一事、旣已毫無異議、則和解手續當然可以成功、同時行政院對於最後結果、亦必迅速加以考慮、艾登繼謂、假使經此仲裁後、意阿問題依然緊張、則簽字一九〇六年條約之國家、仍將立開談判考慮意阿關係之全部問題、屆時彼將對行政院提出一談判報告書、最後艾氏聲稱、英國政府以意阿問題、十分嚴重、同時身負國聯會員國之義務、故極願竭其全力以謀於不背國聯原則之範圍內、和平解决意阿之衝突、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>此外丹麥·阿根廷兩國代表、對於兩項决議案完全贊成、决議通過後、當由主席李維諾夫向努力斡旋之英法兩國代表致謝、然後宣佈行政院非常會議閉會、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>先生　文濡，別署新舊物，為前清明經。主進步書局扶輪社輯政有年。嗣後任職中華文明二書局，編刊楹聯尺牘等書，事學者奉為　　。其偉大供獻，則為說庫，筆記大觀，及香艷叢書，考訂哀集，並加提要，其整理國故之功，至今猶有能道之者。又曾與張蔓孫高太痴鄒酒丐輩，合輯香艷雜誌，若干期後，以費絀而止。</p>
<p>先生碩然而長，目御　　，慈　殊可親接。尤樂於獎掖後進。予識先生於數年前，其時先生寓居滬上哈同路，予得暇輙趨訪之，先生方整輯歷代詩選於書城中促膝坐談，往往移晷。旣而先生築屋吳中北寺塔東石塘橋，曰：「臼辛簃」以為　裘，與予翰札往還，月一二次以為常。且致翰必詢及予之生計境况，懇摯之情，溢於言表，予讀而為之戚涕，蓋知遇如此，求之末世，不易多得也。去秋，予以岳家事返蘇，岳家距臼辛　近，按址往尋，則精楹面圃，繽紛爛熳者悉為雞冠雁來紅諸卉，秋色滿眼，先生婆娑其間，指點而謂予曰：「爾多談果品花之文，盍搜羅增補之槧為專書乎。」予成花果小品一書，此其動機也。小品旣殺靑，郵貽先生，先生大加讚賞，實則率陋蕪雜，殊不値大雅一哂耳。先生於兩月前曾來滬，枉駕見訪，適予外出未晤，一若天之故靳此最後一面然者，今日思之，為之悵惘。</p>
<p>沈三白之浮生六記，為抒情叙事之良好讀物。最初為一抄本，由先生首先覓得，交諸其友黃摩西以謀剞　，於是並普遍於社會。然六記軼其二，先生猶引為憾事，乃再三徵索，始於其鄉人處得軼稿，欲重印以問世。先生死，不知有人能竟其未竟之志否也。</p>
<p>先生喜製謎，曩時海上有萍社，先生為社中健者。間為聯語，無不膾炙人口，一日，孫玉聲前輩，出聯為「三烏害人鴉雀鴇，「先生對以「百蟲讓位虎熊羆。」同人歎為工絕。又偶為詩鐘，如繡雲天鴻爪格云：「湖山錦繡三英地，雲漢文章五色天。」典麗熨貼，無與倫比，繡雲天，卽四馬路神仙世界故址也。</p>
<p>生平所著，舉凡聯語，文虎，詩鐘，以及詩古文辭，筆記，雜俎，都數十萬言，今春承以刊行事見委，奈卒卒未果，人天永隔，予之負疚深矣。</p>

<p>— （嚴懋德）</p>
<p>許多人似乎以為志氣這東西是天生的。不必用人工的改進的。但在實際上，大多數的志氣，都是被叫喚而後起，被推動而後醒的隱伏的東西了</p>
<p>志氣是一種對外界的刺激戚應極銳敏的東西，血在一經喚起之後，仍是需要不斷的注意與敎育的，好像音樂與藝術的天禀之需要注意與敎育一樣，否則它將枯萎以死。</p>
<p>假使我們有志氣而不想去實現志氣，則我們的志氣將不能保持一種銳刺而固定的動態，我們的大禀將變成遲鈍而失掉能力。</p>
<p>常常將自己從一切煩惱痛苦中舉拔出來，而浸人於和諧，美善的環境之中。這種能力，眞可算是無價之寳。</p>

<p>— 王莎葩</p>
<p>走過兆鱟花園和白利南路橋的，人都知道那裏有一夥羅宋瘍三的，他們因為沒有事情可幹，全流落在那裏，每天，祗有靠討銅板來度生活。</p>
<p>勞根，就是其中一個，他能講一口很流利的山東話，對於中國人的事情也都懂得，據他說：「從前是在某軍閥的軍隊「槍械修理處」做事的，薪水每月有八十塊錢，盆子砲步槍等都會修理，現在；沒有事情幹，就沒有辦法了。」每天把討來的錢，除了香姻麵包之外，全是買酒喝的，一天不知要喝多少次，「嗜酒若命」這句話，他們可以「當之無愧」</p>
<p>昨天，勞根在隔壁小飯店裏買飯吃，我問他「為什麼這樣的歡喜酒？」他回答我說：「不喝酒不能討錢，伸開了手；向中國姑娘們討，是多麼的難為情，伊們如果說不給，我就沒有臉再響了，吃飽了酒，就老得起臉皮，不怕難為情，會拉住了黃包車的車槓，一定要討二個銅板。」</p>
<p>他吃好了飯，我給他一張申報，問他『識不識中國文字？』他拿了報，手指指了字句，嘴裏竟哼起西洋曲子的調兒，引得旁人都哈哈大笑，我對他說『報上沒有這個樣子。』他很機警，馬上掉轉嗓子，唱一支『打倒列强」的『中國革命歌，』一字不錯，並且說『這個中國有的。』後來我叫他再唱一個，他伸伸手，要　五個銅板了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十七回　莫問女兒身難言隱痛爭看貴人臉共側高風</p>
<p>今日來找他，不但他說的寫介紹信給錢的事，沒有了影子。那位賈先生答應的鐵，也說要等他經手。好容易把他找到了，才把火車票錢弄到了手。至於他本人的，他一字不提。我几次用話去探他的口氣，他總是含糊着。我這就看出來了，他是存心騙我。說着，這才在衣袋裏掏出一方小手絹，慢慢的擦着眼睛。志前在猜透了他的遭遇而後，也替他可憐。便歎一口氣道：楊小姐，不是我則現在還說你，你也有錯處。你自身也是個落魄的女人，你就不該岡了人家謝媒，把朱家姑娘硬賣掉了。他果然做姨太太，救話自己和母親祖母三條命，那還罷了。不過我看那位賈先生也是一時性慾衝動，花個百十來塊錢，找這麼個女孩子解解悶。他有一天不高興了，他還要他嗎？不過這話又說回來了，他果然五七天之後不高興，把朱姑娘丟下來了，那還不要緊，至多是糟蹋了他的身子，他的性命還在。就怕他帶出潼關去了，他還眞能讓朱姑娘的祖母母親跟了去不成？那時候他要把朱姑娘一丟，這位沒有見過大局面的姑娘到了那個時候，成了叫天無路，入地無門，那豈非走入了死地？浣花聽說，依然沒有作聲，許久才答道：我想賈先生現在這樣的喜歡他，就是將來變心，總也會給他一個下台的地步，决不至於丟了他就不問。（二八一）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>一直到這天晚上，伊的心思還不曾解開，以致精神非常不寗，無論怎樣小的事情，伊也斤地較量着；普通一般老年人所有的一種暴躁易怒的特性，伊這時候巳充分的表顯出來了。但是到得快要進晚膳的時候，伊的苦悶突然自動地鬆開了，因為伊已經開始說話了，而且所說的就是伊方才藏在肚子裏的一節話。最先和伊說話的還是我。伊的第一句話是一句問句，這句問句却是非常的奇妙，我委實從不會料想到。伊問我道：</p>
<p>「你有沒有給人家打過？」</p>
<p>這一問簡直把我問呆了，一時那裏對答得出。我究竟有沒有給人家打過呢？這問題對於我這樣一個養尊處優的人原是無需推問的，而且是絕對不可能的！「打」這一種處罰，原是祗為着人家的奴僕，以及太監和奴隸們而設的。我自己也承認當我年輕時，因為性氣很暴跺的緣故，逢到家裏的僕婦或婢女們做錯了什麼事情，觸怒了我，我少不得也要責打伊們幾下；而伊們受打之後，還得跪下來向我瞌頭，謝我的打，並自誓以後决不再犯。這種事情，在我們看來，彷彿原是很　該的；可是我自已又應該受什麼人打呢或者就是我的父親和母親嗎？但我的母親是最和軟不過的，婢僕也不打，那裏會打我？父親雖說嚴厲一些，却也從不曾舉起手來打過我，便是高聲的責罵，也可以說是向所未有的！（三八一）</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>凡昆虫魚蝦之類：往往能蛻變。如甲物，能化為乙物。前本刊載「楊花小語，」說：「有時落在人家書籍上面，就會變做蛀虫。若是落到靑草池塘裏，也就會化做了浮萍。這固是當然的事：但有某君也做了一篇「楊花辯。」說：「魚蝦之子，能化蝗蝻。」又「腐草化為螢，」都沒有這回事。而且還牽引到西游記上去，說這些事，都是和孫行者拔了幾根臺毛，會綫什麼東西，一樣的是神話。依在下看來：這些話，未免所見太不廣了。別的且不說如立夏後，水鼠能變鯽魚。從前在下往在蘇州，所居後面是臨河的。親見一尾拖着一條鼠尾的鯽魚，原來它還沒有變化成功。又藥舖中所川的蜈蚣，是用雞毛和頭發所種出來的。先把泥土掘到一尺深，把雞毛和頭髮，放在裏面，上面仍用泥土輕輕蓋好。約過了一星期撥開來，裏面就發見了許多的蜈蚣，雞毛和頭髪，也化為鳥有了。再金魚可用　子來種，天　我生也會說過。這都是信而有徵的；總之，現在科學雖發達。這種事也應該加以研究。不應指為迷信和神話一類事，而加以鄙棄。</p>
<p>日前讀本刊「水果的營養」一則：謂「桃的果汁，與梨相同。患熱病者，多吃桃汁，可以解熱。」云云：按桃子性熱，是盡人都知的。本草亦謂「桃子辛酸，甘熱，微毒。多食令人有熱，生癰癤。」與梨之性凉，淸肺熱，功用絕不相同，若用之治熱病，豈非是以熱治熱，無益而有損嗎？小兒純陽之體，尤不宜多食。古人五果，列桃為下。就是這個意思！</p>

<p>— 芥子</p>
<p>在炎暑如蒸的夏日，濃膩食品，每覺下咽為難，余妻佩玉善作菓凍，凍膏一類食品，或作小食，或佐盤殮，一味淸凉？增進食慾不少，茲述其數種製法如下：</p>
<p>蘋果凍　取蘋果數枚，削去其皮，切成薄片，浸入適量之水，用文火徐煮，等到果肉已軟，便用布絞取它的汁，瀘淸渣滓，加糖煮沸，倒入碗中，置之冰箱或冷水中，約半點鐘，便成透明的凍了。</p>
<p>濘檬凍　洋菜七八錢浸入冷水使軟；次取鮮濘檬二枚，連皮切成薄片，置凈鍋內，加水數大杯煮沸，濾去渣滓，再加入洋菜，及糖三四兩，俟洋菜溶化，倒於模子裏，外嵌以冰，不久便成濘檬凍了。</p>
<p>巧克力粉凍　穀粉，牛乳，白糖，用水拌和，隔水蒸為粉糊；細麵粉，玫瑰花或汁，如上法製成粉糊；再以粉和巧克力糖數塊另為粉糊；乃取預製之模，先倒入白粉糊，次為巧克力糊，最後為玫瑰紅糊，文火徐蒸，時以橘汁潤之，冰在冷水裏，就成功了。</p>
<p>鵝脯凍　取洗凈鵝脯，浸入葡萄酒，醬油精及醋之混合液中，約三小時，放入鍋中，加水，香料，球葱，　檬皮，洛勒葉，芫荽等物文火煮之，俟熟取出，切成方塊；另煮小牛脯，加以葡萄酒，醬油及酷，以布濾出其汁，注於鵝脯上，置之透風處或冷水中，須臾便凍，確是暑天絕妙的下酒物。</p>
<p>鷄脯凍　製法視鵝脯凍。</p>
<p>梭魚凍　梭魚一尾，去鱗及腹內各物，剖為二，用水滌凈。入鍋加水，醋，葡萄酒，醬油，香料，蕪荽，球葱各少許，洛勒葉，濘檬？等物，徐徐煮之。取出後另以牛肉汁（去脂肪）注其上，近冷處片刻，便成堅凝的梭魚凍。</p>

<h3 id="c170">柯顯來滬　表演發生困難　業餘不能對抗職業　或將借重卡那凡洛 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>世界職業網球選手前法國台杯代表柯顯將於秋初來滬表演、巳與上海網球會邱飛海接洽妥當、一時甚引起上海網球界之注意、但因柯顯目下已為一職業選手、職業與業餘之關係、柯顯在滬表演、據目下看來、恐希望不多也、</p>
<p>最大困難</p>
<p>最大之困難問題、為世界網球恊會之規定、業餘選手不得與職業選手、作任何比賽、否則將失去其業餘資格、上海草地網球會得柯顯來滬之消息後、會電英國網球協會詢問可否與柯顯作表演比賽、但迄今尙未得倫敦覆電、恐未必允許也、至於全國體育恊進會方面、為世界業餘體育協會規則所限、亦未必允許中華業餘選手與之比賽也、</p>
<p>星洲方面</p>
<p>柯顯目下正在遨遊馬來印度各地、過星加坡時、馬來網球協會曾擬與柯顯作比賽、因未為國際網球協會所允許作罷、香港方面、恐同一情形、星洲香港俱如此情形、上海方面、恐亦未能例外也、</p>
<p>來滬希望</p>
<p>唯一之希望、將來柯顯來滬、能與其教練員作一次比賽、或與上海目下唯一之職業網球選手老將卡那凡洛比賽、如果海上網球選手、如願放棄其業餘資格者、亦不妨與柯作一次比賽也、</p>

<p>日本網球選手昨應中國網球會之約、在新加坡路該會球事塲再度比賽、主要節目、在兩林之戰、寳華上次在法商會敗於日選手林後、頗不甘心、滿擬昨日破釜沉舟、一雪前恥、但結果反連負兩稩、戰績猶不如上次、雙打德孚未到、改由林寳華與邱飛海配合、亦遭敗北、張定釗之技術、近來確進步不少、史規亞遠非其敵、兩盤中史僅得三局而已、現日選手在滬征程已畢、已於昨夜登輪、全勝而歸、（對上海會之比賽已取消）</p>
<p>（一）張定釗　六比二　六比一　史規亞</p>

<p>（二）林（日）　六比二　六比四　林寶華</p>
<p>第二塲為兩林之單打、二次相見、戰來格外劇烈、底綫長抽、美麗悅目、而日選手之半塲對角射擊、銳急非凡、上網截擊、亦甚美妙、林寳華幾無制勝之術、反一再自殺、增加對手獲勝機會、觀昨日之戰、林寳華之技術、實遠不如林氏也、</p>
<p>藤井倉光（日）　六比三　六比三　林寶華　邱飛海</p>
<p>最後雙打、因德字未到、仍由林寶華與邱飛海配搭、結果又以兩個六比三敗北、日選手藤井之攔網高壓、細膩爽脆、兇狠非凡、倉光略差、林邱一無出奇戰略、技術方面、不如猶遠、</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>小橋又復去看他所心愛的書，他的妹妹領了這個新客到了後面的一間房裏，在這裏他們見到一個强碩的男子正和兩個小孩在蘇乏上玩耍作樂，一個瘦削的婦人正寫畢了一封信，她似正在重讀一遍。（蘇乏即Sofa俗譯沙發）</p>
<p>「他在這裏，姨姨」！小梅喊道。</p>
<p>「這是我的新童子吧？我喜歡看見你，我的親愛的，希望你在這裏能够快快活活」，那婦人說道，同時拖他到她的身邊，並以慈母似的撫摩和容色，去理他額上的髮使其向後，從此乃德孤獨的小心靈對她便覺依依不捨了。</p>
<p>她的狀貌並不美麗，然而她却有一種歡樂的容相，似乎總掉不了幾種小孩般的態度與神氣，而她的聲音與舉止亦是如此。這些事難於描寫，却容易見到和覺得，使她成就了欣愉和靄的一流人，容易和人相與，而且當當是歡樂的。她整疊他的頭髮時，見到乃德的小口唇微顫，她一副銳利的眼睛便顯出了矜惜的柔情，但她却更加把這個衣服敝破的人拖近身些，笑說道：</p>
<p>「我是裴媽媽，那位男先生是裴伯伯，這兩個是小裴。小孩們過來見見乃德」。</p>
<p>那扭在一起的三個人立刻遵命：這強碩的人每個肩上頂了一個肥胖的小孩，便過來歡迎那個新來的男孩。羅勃和坦第只向他一徵笑，可是裴先生却來和他握手，並且指點近火的一各小凳，以懇切的聲調說着：</p>
<p>「這裏已經預備了一個座位給你，我的兒；坐下去即刻烘乾你的一雙浸濕的脚罷」。</p>
<p>「浸濕？正是呢！我的寶，立刻說去你的鞋子，我馬上可以準備攜燥的東西給你」，裴夫人喊着，他往來諜　得十分起勁，乃德還沒有能夠開口說話，已經見到自己安樂在一個舒適的椅上，並有乾燥的襪子及和暖的便鞋在自己腳上了。於是他只說一聲，「謝謝師母」：說得那麼誠懇，竟使裴夫人又顯出了慈祥的顏色，他本是個易於感動的人，至此感動極深，於是偏來說些開心的話。</p>

<h3 id="c182">洋米何時始入中國之檢討 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>昨（八月三日）應中華靑年會之約，講演中國民食問題。臨行有姚君者以洋米何時始入中國為問。此一問題，內容較為複雜，非數語所能盡，愛將本文披露，藉供參考。至關於進口米糧之沿革，拙作除已見於「中國歷代民食政策史」外（商務書館出版）、，最近復有兩文：（一）為「洋米與中國民食之關係」，（見七月份新中華雜誌，中華書局出版）（二）為「洋米免稅及其徵稅之經過」（見七月份申報月列，申報館出版），以及本文如彙合觀之，則於洋米史的方面，出納情形大致略備。此外如進口粉麥，整理亦有成稿，容後再行發表。　四日晨</p>
<p>洋米何時始入中國，淸代以外，史書幾無明文可據，但其入中國，决不自淸始，可以推想及之。蓋今之所謂洋米產地，非曾人我版圖，即為我藩屬，其關係均發生於數千年前，則米糧輸入，豈待遲至淸初而始實現。爰就史書中，所載當時各產米國情形；及與我國關係之變遷，則洋米何時始入中國之一問題，或不難於此中檢紂理解得之。</p>
<p>洋米與我國關係最密切者，為東京西貢等米，是皆產於安南。安南自秦漢至唐，列入我國版圖之內。至宋初，中經五代割據之局，始離我而獨立，然仍不脫藩屬關係。及淸季為法所併，始與我為異國。溯自漢武帝遣伏波將軍路博德取南越地，分設九郡，而其最南之三郡——交阯，九眞，日南三郡，即今安南北圻（東京一帶）之地也。據後漢書所載：</p>
<p>「漢交阯郡距洛陽南萬一千里，九眞郡距洛陽南一萬一千五百八十里，日南郡距洛陽南一萬三千四百里。」</p>
<p>蓋「日南」之得名，為地在日之南，戶皆北向。而其所領之五縣，其南檄之縣為「象林」，象林之得名，又為其地多象（秦時即名之為象郡）。至漢順帝永和二年（公元一三七年）為其檄外蠻夷區憐等所攻有，稱為林邑國。其後即為「占不勞」「占婆」「古城」之國境，約當今之安南中圻地方也。漢時交阯農作已發達，而九眞尙度其遊牧生活，可於後漢書任延傳見之。傅云：（註）</p>
<p>「九眞俗以射獵為業，不知牛耕，民常告糴交趾，每致國乏。延乃令鑄作田器，敎之墾闢田疇，歲歲開廣，百姓充給。」</p>
<p>至日南地方，土壤亦肥沃，梁書云：（註三）</p>
<p>「林邑先無田土，貪日南地肥沃，常欲略有之。晋穆帝永和三年（公元三四七年），夏侯覽為太守，侵刻尤甚。林邑國王范文內民之怨，遂與兵襲日南。……」</p>
<p>林邑所以欲略日南而有之，正為其地肥沃，便於耕種也。</p>
<p>又新元史（註四）所載安南晨作情形，有云：</p>
<p>「其物產多稻無麥，重蠶桑，有紬布，不植棉花，竹木成林蔽日……草木四時不凋，畫夜無長短，古所稱日南者，殆不虛也。」</p>
<p>明史所載註五）更為明瞭，有云：</p>
<p>「其疆域東距海，南渡海即占城，北連廣西之思明南寗，雲南之臨安元江。土膏腴，氣候熱，穀歲稔。」</p>
<p>明太祖嘗命安南國王（註六）陳煒饋雲南軍餉，即輸五千石於臨安。二十七年討龍州，又令安南輸米八萬石餉龍州軍，永樂五年，大軍討安南破之，所獲之勝利品重，有米一千三百六十萬石，設非安南　產豐富，何能屢濟軍實，而所積又如是其豐厚。至其運入中國，據宋史所載：</p>
<p>「祥符三年，交阯郡王黎龍廷求互市於邕州，上曰，瀕海之民，數患交州侵寇，仍前止許賡州及如洪砦互助，蓋爲邊隅控扼之所，今或直趨內地，事頗非便。」</p>
<p>當明太祖之令輸米於龍州軍也，安南以陸險，請運至恐祥洞，乃令輸二萬石於沿海江，江距龍州止半日。可見當時中越間五市，海運為便。而我國缺米最茶之閩粵兩省，又皆沿海，早與南方互市，則安南米之潼入，自有其可能性也。</p>
<p>有謂秈米之由來，即宋眞宗大中祥符四年（公元一〇一一年）就福建所取之占城稻也。遂以中國原有者謂之粳，來自占城者，長江流域謂之秈，閩夸之人謂粘，或作黏，以其自占城來也。惟按揚於方言「江南之人呼粳為釉」，則粳與秈本為一物。姑不論此說之說靠與否，即就宋史以觀，先云：</p>
<p>「言者謂：江北之民，雜植諸穀，江南專種秔程，雖土風各有所宜，至於參植以防水旱，亦古之制。於是詔江南兩浙荊湖嶺南福建諸州長史，勸民益種諸穀。民乏粟麥黍豆種者於淮北州郡給之。江者諸州亦令就水廣種粳稻，並免其租。</p>
<p>於此可見江南之種秔稻，迄今仍然，並未稍改。而如今種秈區域之廣大，又遠勝於種粳區域。凡閩粵兩浙以及長江產米諸省，其大宗米產莫不為秞。故謂秈種之輸入，始於宋眞宗時，則宋真宗以前數千年，所植豈甚為粳乎？若然，何以一旦占城稻輸入，便爾盡棄粳稻而皆改種乎？果占城稻之轉移力量有如是其偉大，又何以江南一帶至今仍保留其「專種骯稻」之習慣而不為之同化乎？此求諸理而不可明，求諸事而有所難通也。再宋眞宗之就福建取占城稻。明明為早稻之一種，史云：「江淮兩浙稍早，即水田不登，故取占城稻三萬斛，分給三路為種，擇民田高仰者時之，蓋早稻也。」又曰：「不擇地而生，」可見其又為旱稻。接安南稻作，從時季言之，有早稻與晚稻，從性質言之，則有所謂水稻及旱稻。但安南人亦以種晚稻為多，早稱為少。水稻為多，旱稻較少。蓋早稻播種在十一月，收穫在翌年三月，正値乾季，故雨量較少而取獲薄，旱稻亦如是，此所以多種水稻晚稻也。則占城稻輸入中國之後，焉知亦為收穫薄而為江浙農民所摒棄乎？或即今之一歲兩熟之早稻種尙屬可信。惟嶺南一帶之粘米容或有來自占城，然亦不能盡謂為占城種。占城之與中國通，在周顯德年問，為時巳後。在其未通前，兩粵因早已有稻，觀於任延敎九眞人種稻，可以推想及之。惟兩粵與越南相接壤，稻種之交換，在事實本為可能。若謂占城稻種易變，即謂今之秈米，均為占城稻之變種，未免遠矣。且更有一證明，使「秈」與「粘」同失其辯論之價値者，則為宋史所記占城國之農產有云：</p>
<p>（占城國……五穀無麥，有秔米西米豆麻子，」</p>
<p>史稱占城之稻不曰「秈」，不曰「粘」，而曰「秔」，可見「秞」與「粘」，同為江南與閩粵之土語也。由此可見中國非無秞，而書不著者，蓋以秈為杭之一種，正不必標而出之，故曰占城稻，不曰占城秈，稻者，固米穀之總稱也。</p>
<p>且占城就史書以為考察，其先並不產米；即就現在之地形觀之，亦非稻作巨區。蓋占城自林邑國被唐張丹擊走，遷至占婆，號稱占城國。林邑之無田土，前已言之矣。而占城平原少，生活於海岸山地之中，以海事為業，常求其所乏於國外，寇掠海舟，（如宋孝宗乾道三年奪大食國人之物，入貢於宋）或北侵安南，南襲柬浦寨。（註七）故宋史於占城國獨將其與中國往來之海程，記載詳明，可為宋與占城海道往來頻繁之明證。其言曰：</p>
<p>「占城國在中國之西南，東至海，……北至廣州的風半月程，東北至兩浙，月程，西北至交州兩日程，陸行半月程。」</p>
<p>交際與占城接壤，然陸行需半月程，海運祗兩日程，可見兩者間陸上交通之不便。故當宋太宗太平興國六年，交阯王黎桓欲伐占城，亦因山路險阻，乃新築海港，利便航路，占城之為背山面海，交通往來，不能遵陸而循海明矣。惟共以海事為業，故常與海外諸國往來貿易，因之米穀等笨重貨物，亦得以海運而轉販為便。且凡山濱海澨，所產恒不足以供所生，故常求其所乏於海外。昔林邑王思略日南肥沃之地而有之，占城常與交阯眞臘相爭戰，均無非為生存而爭也。如是而謂占城米產，自給有餘並能給人，為必無之事實。明史有云：（註八）</p>
<p>「其國（占城）無霜雪，四時皆似夏，草木常靑，民以漁為業，無麥，力穡者少，故收穫薄，國人皆食檳榔，終日不離口。」</p>
<p>又云：（註九）</p>
<p>「明成化間令安南王黎灝還占城土宇，灝秦言：「占城非沃壞，家鮮積儲，野絕桑麻。」由此可知占城人之生活，為航海，為捕魚，而「地非沃壤，家鮮積儲」，更可見其為非力農稼穡之人民，烏得有大宗米稻，輸出海外。則宋史所謂占城稻，當占城產，而為占城人轉運之貨物（或即眞臘產物）焉明甚，宋人不察，而以為占城稻也。</p>
<p>真即今安南之南圻，產米之鄉也。隋書云：（註十）</p>
<p>「眞臘國在秫邑西南，本扶南之屬國也。去日南郡舟行六十日。……其國北多山阜，南有水澤。地氣尤熱，無霜雪。土宜梁稻，少黍粟果菜，與日南九眞相類。」</p>
<p>史家不以占城與之相比，正見占城之不事排作。又唐書有云：（註十一）</p>
<p>「眞臘國本扶南之屬國……南方人謂眞臘國為吉蔑國，神龍以後，眞臘分為二，半以南近海多坡澤處，謂之水眞臘（即南圻），半以北多山阜，謂之陸眞臘（即柬埔寨）</p>
<p>又以其海有明珠寳貝，山有金玉香木，故又有「富貴眞臘」之稱。但占城與眞臘常相爭戰，宋光宗紹熙初年，（註十二）占城曾一度為真臘所滅，故又名占臘。其後兩國：兵連禍結，至明未已。明史所載眞臘稻作情形（註十三）有云：</p>
<p>「眞臘在占城南，順風三畫夜可至。……天時常熱，不識霜雪，禾一歲數稔。」</p>
<p>安南占城眞臘與我中國之往來，在宋時已盛。而宋時閩粵諸省民食，巳賴安南米接濟者，如祥符間就福建取占城稻三萬石，其明證也，至明時洋米進口，為欲避免稅餉，南洋商船，多載米而不載貨。（註十五）然吾人如欲追溯洋米最初之由來，仍應溯及中國何時始由海道與南方諸國通。按晋書有云：</p>
<p>「初檄外（注十六）諸國，賣買物自海外來貿貨賄，交州刺史日南太守貪利侵侮，十折二三。」</p>
<p>在交通不便之時，祇能擇其珍寳便於携帶者貿易之，及航運通，船舶裝載，始不論鉅細，皆可轉致，梁書云：</p>
<p>「海外諸國，自梁革運，其奉正朔，納貢賦，航海歲至，踰於前代矣。」</p>
<p>則其時與請國間海運已盛。又經唐代之開發，聲威遠暨，南方諸國，皆呼華人為唐人。（註十七）又各扶南國（即今之暹羅）王在中國吳晋之交，巳造大船橫行海上。歷晋宋齊梁隋唐，屢通貢獻，皆足為已與中國通商互市之明證。雖古代人民通番之禁甚嚴，但如為朝貢之國，則亦不禁。（註十八）自宋以來，互市漸盛，凡粵閩兩浙江南沿海大口岸，設市舶司以司征榷，海外互市，旣成故常，洋米如有需要，自亦隨之以輸入矣（或謂米穀輸入，何以不見於史，此正為當時史家所忽略，如象牙沉香金銀珠寶，以為珍寶，無不大書特書。而有關民食之「米」，轉以為家常食物，不為當世人士所經意，文獻無可徵，其故或在此。再則交阯諸郡所產之米，在宋以前視之，固為我國產，而舊史對於民生經濟，大都缺乏記載，此又不僅米之一種為然。如有轉運接濟，原不必大書特書，故祇可於文字中推求得之。</p>
<p>安南米旣早入中國，至今仍為中國進口米糧之巨壁。此外與安南米可相匹敵者則為暹羅米。暹羅見於我國史書者為晋書，有云</p>
<p>「扶南西去林邑三千餘里，以耕種為務，一歲種，三歲穫。」</p>
<p>隋書云：</p>
<p>「赤土國，扶南之別種也。……冬夏常溫，雨多霖少，種植無時，特宜稻穄，白豆黑麻。」</p>
<p>新元史云：</p>
<p>「暹與羅斛，古之扶南國也。……羅斛在退之南，濱大海，暹土瘠不宜稼穡。羅斛地平衍，種多穫，暹人仰給焉。有大河，自暹達於羅斛東南入海，每夏有黃水，自海港漲入內河，農民乘時櫂舟播種，苗隨水以漸而漲，水尺苗亦尺，水退苗熟，有播植，無耕耘，故穀豐而賤。」</p>
<p>此言暹羅榖賤之故。明史有云：</p>
<p>「暹羅國在占城西南，順風十晝夜可至。即隋唐赤土國，後分為羅斛，暹一國。暹土瘠不宜稼，羅斛地平衍，種多獲，暹仰給焉。元時羅斛強，併有其地，遂稱暹羅斛國。洪武十年王子來朝，鑄印賜之，文曰「暹羅國王之印」，其國邑朝命，始稱暹羅。」</p>
<p>至淸康熙年間，暹羅入貢，聞其毀價賤，乃命之運往粵閩　販，免其稅。（註十九）自是暹米之進口日甚，與安南同偉中國民食有力之接濟，亦爲中國最大值漏巵焉。</p>
<p>唐書所載南方產米諸國尚有：</p>
<p>「東謝蠻，地在黔州之西數百里，南接守宮獠，西連夷子，北至蠻，土宜五榖，不以中耕，但未　天，每歲易。」</p>
<p>「婆利國在林邑東南海中，……風氣暑熱，恒如中國之盛夏，榖一歲再熟。」</p>
<p>此外紙巾尚不失爲閩省民食之一接濟者，即台灣是也。台灣在為割與日本以前，常以米接濟內地，自割於日，亦有輸入。至其稻作之由來，明史有云：（註二十）</p>
<p>「雞籠山以青草爲歲有，土宜五榖，而不善水田，榖種落地則止殺，謂行好事助天公乞飯食，旣收穫，卽標竹竿於道，謂之挿靑，此時逢外人便殺矣。……萬曆末，紅毛番泊舟於此，因事耕鑿，設團團，稱台灣焉。」</p>
<p>經我華人開闢草萊，戮力經營，米，遂為台灣出產之大宗，而今非復我有矣。</p>

<h3 id="c189">作家的作風與其個性 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 王集叢</p>
<p>一般說來，不僅是各時代各流派的作家的作風，有本質上的不同，就是同一時代同一流派的作家，其各自的作風也是有着某種程度上的差異的。事實上，高乃衣與莫利哀便是同一時代的法國古典主義的劇作家，但人却不能說他們的作風是完全一樣的；拜倫，雪萊與濟茨，都是同一時代的英國的浪漫主義者，但他們的作品却是各有其特點的；托爾斯泰和杜斯托以夫斯基，也同是聞名世界的十九世紀的俄國大文豪，而且都可說是寫實主義者，但在描寫人物時，前者「是從主人公的性格之發展的描寫開始，移行到Drama的。」後者則是「從Drama開始，移行到準備Drama的性格之發展」的，這樣便顯示出了他們的作風的大大的不同……。——對此各作家的作風不同的事實的解說，一般個人主義者是求之於各作家的獨特的個性。若依他們，則便是每一個作家都有其獨特的個性，因為各個作家的個性不同，所以其各自的作風也就有所差異了；要了解各作家的獨特的作風乃至其作品的全部內容與形式，在他們看來，最重要的乃是努力去考究作家的私生活和其獨特的個性；此外一切，皆非所問。</p>
<p>不錯，每一個作家都必有其獨特的個性，而且，這獨特的個性與其作風也是很有關係的；但我們却不能因此便說作家的作風是其獨特的個性規定的，當然也就不應由其獨特的個性去解說其獨特的作風了。上述那些作家的作風之有相當的不同，在其各自的個性中能找到一些表面的說明也未可知，但我們却無法由他們的獨特的個性去說明其整個作風。因為每一個作家都是生活於其所屬的現實社會中的，都是享用那社會的物質，視聽那社會的事物，想那社會的問題的，所以，其思想，其創作才能，其作品的內容，都是由其生活着的社會所規定；至於其作風，更是直接由其作品所表現的內容，間接由其生活意識時代精神規定着的，就拿上述那些作家來說吧。如高乃衣與莫利哀，他們因為同是生活於絕對主義時代的法國，為同樣的時代精神所熏染，受着差不多同樣的環境的支配，所以其作風在根本上是相同的：古典主義的作風；雖然在這根本相同之下，他們各自的作風亦有些微的差異，但這差異是存在於那在根本上相同的風中的，而且是由他們各自在其生活中所接觸的事物。所獲得的知識之些微的不同所構成的；所謂獨特的個性於此並不能起獨立的作用，如果要說在這裏個性有作用的話，那都是附屬在社會的作用之下的。拜倫等的作風之大同小異，也可以用同樣的原理去解釋。至如杜斯托以夫斯基的描寫人物的法則之與托爾斯泰和其同時代的人的不同，我們甚至可以說這是與橫在於他的作品中的反對貴族社會，反對傳統的思想內容相結合着的；他曾在其「脆弱的心」中作了這樣一個自白：「必須預先說明和記述登場人物的地位，職業，特別是性格吧，但因為這種方法開始寫作的作家很多，因為這里所敘述的小說作　不願步他們後塵，就決心只從一個人目前的行為開始下筆了。「不願步人後塵」，這便是反傳統思想的表現。於此如果有人要用杜恩托以夫斯基的特殊的個性去說明其特殊的作風時，那恐怕是徒勞吧。大家知道，杜恩托以夫斯基的最特殊的個性是好賭，愛「喫醋」，但是，這和他的「從一個人目前的行為開始下筆」的描寫法則有何關係呢？一點關係也沒有！</p>
<p>那些以作家的個性來解釋其作風的個人主義者，最高興談的是巴爾扎克。因為巴爾扎克有奇特的相貌與個性；他的身體肥大，面貌醜陋，他的性情狂放，粗暴，喜怒無常；同時，他描寫事物又很直率，他常用被人們所認為的「粗俗」的「辛辣」的筆法去表現現實；所以，一般個人主義的文藝研究者便毫不遲疑地下了這樣一個結論：巴爾扎克的「粗俗」的「簡單的」作風，他的「粗暴」，「辛辣」的風味，完全是由他的狂放，粗暴的個性所規定着的。但是，依我看來，對於個人主義的文藝研究者最不利的，恐怕正是巴爾扎克。</p>
<p>的確，巴爾扎克在其一切作品中，好用那被人們所認為的「有傷大雅」的「粗俗」的字句和「辛辣」的諷刺語。亨利·詹姆曾說巴爾扎克的筆是「粗糙的，猛烈的，蠻動的」，說他的作風是「最簡單的」，如果單從形式上看來，這些評論也未始沒有道理。但是，所謂「粗俗」的字句和「辛辣」的諷刺語，所謂「粗糙的，猛烈的，蠻動的」筆法，並不是空的東西，而是表現着一定的思想與感情的；巴爾扎克之好用「粗俗」的字句和「辛辣」的諷刺語，好用「粗糙的，猛烈的，蠻動的」筆法，是因為他是寫實主義的先驅，他要暴露現實的真實面貌，顯示社會的醜惡面，是不得不用那樣的字句和筆法的。所以，我們說巴爾扎克的好用那樣的字句和筆法，是由其社會思想，由其寫實主義的創作法則規定的，他的粗暴，狂放的個性，在此並沒有獨特的，重大的意義。如不以此為然，那我們便要問：福羅培爾與左拉的作風可說是和巴爾扎克的有些類似，「波葉利夫人」（福羅培爾）與「羅貢·馬格爾叢書」（左拉），甚至可說是受了巴爾扎克的「人間喜劇」的很大影響的；在描寫現實方面，他們也和巴爾扎克一樣，是用着真誠的筆去寫的，因此左拉的著作在一般正人君子看來，不僅是「粗俗」，而且是下流，甚至以為有女孩子的家庭不應存放他的作品；假使巴爾扎克的作風是其個性規定的，那麼，與其作風如此類似的福羅培爾和左拉的個性便應與其個性相類似了，但是，福羅培爾的個性是孤僻，他並不狂放，粗暴，左拉也沒有狂放，粗暴的性格，他是很艱苦地細心地努力創作的——這個矛盾應該如何解決呢？用個性去解說作家的作風的文藝研究者，如不能解決這個矛盾，那其理論便顯示得沒有多大用處了。</p>
<p>總而言之，作家的作風是由其作品的思想內容，由其生活常識，由其所感受的時代精神規定着的，至其個性在此的作用乃是次要的，所以要了解作家作風，便只有從社會的見地去研究其作品，他的個性和私生活只不過是在這研究中的一個補助的參考資料罷了。「太白斗酒詩百篇」，我們在研究李白的作風時，知道他好酒的性是有益的，但單是這樣還不夠得多，因為我們不能說李白的詩是酒製的，也不能用其好酒的個性去說明其作風；只有去考察其詩作所表現的社會意識和其整個創作方法，才能在根本上了解問題。對於其他的一切作家的作風的研究也須如此。</p>

<p>老孫苦着臉喝下那杯辛澀的酒，客人看到他杯子空了，才把自己手上的酒骨嘟嘟一氣吸下，杯子一揚，打着哈哈回到自己座上去了。</p>
<p>老孫頭裏昏昏沉沉，祇想躺下來睡一大覺，可是為的要維持熱鬧的場面，沒法兒，祇好吃力地拉開笑臉，拼命灌人家的酒，再無可奈何地吞下人家灌他的酒。</p>
<p>酒像一條黃色的小河，在酒壺與杯子間不息的流：菜一道一道地上來，撒下去，熱氣騰上來像薄薄一層霧；燈光刺眼地亮着；電風扇生氣地掠着；可是大家還得流汗。一壁流汗，一壁相罵吵架的敬着酒，還得顧到夾菜往嘴邊送。賓主都得打起精神來吃喝，談話，陪人家笑。</p>
<p>送完了客人時，主人老孫按着抽痛的頭在會鈔，光是花雕就有六塊五角，摸摸痛着的頭，心裏邊嘆着氣喊冤枉！</p>
<p>下一天是星期，老孫睡中覺醒來，悶悶的打了個呵欠，太太候他把呵欠打夠，慢慢的問：</p>
<p>『陪我出去下子好嗎』？</p>
<p>『我沒工夫』。</p>
<p>『什麽事』？</p>
<p>『晚上有應酬』。</p>
<p>『又是應酬！寶寶混身給蚊子叮滿，再不想法子，怕要發　疾了。我想去給他買頂帳子來，你要忙應酬，就我一個人去好了』。</p>
<p>『那兒來這些閒錢』？</p>
<p>『報上有廉價廣告，祇要五塊錢』。</p>
<p>頭痛還沒有全好的老孫，醒來心緒本來有點兒不太順溜，聽到太太又要買這買那，便吼了起來：</p>
<p>『五塊錢！抽斗裏一共還剩五塊錢，到月底還有一星期，你去買！你去買！一家子的嘴都封起來』！</p>
<p>發作過，趁着那股火氣帶來的精神，便穿起長衫出門『應酬』去了。</p>
<p>太太一個人抹着眼淚，怨着那喜怒不常的男人。抬起頭來，看到桌子上堆着一大堆上一日人家送的銀盾，花籃，鏡框，對聯，放着一股子的富貴氣。眼再掃到旁邊寶寶的搖籃，寶寶正睡得酣，一臉一身的紅點子。想起了帳子，做媽媽的傷心起來了。心裏一恨，跑過去把那些紅紅綠綠亮晶晶的東西，一齊用勁推在地板上，一片響，把搖籃裏的寶寶也嚇醒，哇啦哇啦的哭起來了。</p>

<p>— 蘆焚</p>
<p>小山遍植柏同刺松，潮濕而且陰寒，輕風裏夾着淡淡的松香味。市鎮從山腳下起，一直向東展佈開去。</p>
<p>市鎮上住着三五百戶人家，頗稱豐庶的，只消向街巷走一遭，便知有多少高大的門墻同樓房，既登至高處一望，不免措愣了。</p>
<p>市盡頭的角上，青烟裊裊上昇，有一股正向高朗的天空衝上去，另一股已竟變成一縷一縷，夾在微風里，向曠野飄去，而且終於消散了。而在另一個角上，高大的樓房却現出了原形，屋頂不見了，燒焦的殘垣在青青的天下聳立着，太陽從大得可怕的窗洞里照進去，那樣空洞無物，彷彿經過蒙古刦擄的歐洲。</p>
<p>原來這裏在五六年前經過兩次浩刦，很倒霉的。最初有一種「封建集體」的結社，呌做「天門會」的，有皇帝，有后妃，有軍師，大帥文武官司也不少什麽，還擁有不少皇軍同土地。幹法當然不十分文明，按中國的老傳授，一人稱帝，是必須殺人百萬的。既然登了極，違抗「天命」的就得殺。這王國定有一條出色的法律：凡我庶黎得各備槍一枝，除婦女老弱不計外，壯丁皆編入皇軍。也行徵兵制。這一來佃農同窮農都遭了大殃，槍是買不起的，只好殺罷。然而最不幸的，還是既不「違抗天命」也不上「勸晉表」的無業流民，因為皇家律典上又有一條規定着：凡不務正業者，殺勿論。如此消滅消耗者，救濟失業，方法真高明極了。</p>
<p>這樣熱鬧出奇的日子約過了二年之久，又是調兵，又是遣將，不得已，皇上出奔了，皇族及其家將也都溜開了，軍隊一到，便規復了失地，火也就燒了個滿天紅。</p>
<p>過後不久，時局大定，校尉們回家收拾殘局，重新當起地主來。百姓，也正預備安居樂業，可是說聲不好，東山的居民擄進來了，不可免的，又是殺人，又是一場火。然而西山的居民也並不「王道」，隨即就大舉反攻，侵入東山，又殺了人，又放了火，不僅奪回了自己的東西，且連別人的什物也一股腦兒駝過來了。這樣一來二去，周圍百餘里間便都「付之一炬」。當時要打電報，很用得上「殘磚碎瓦，赤地千里」的。</p>
<p>現在已經很太平了。遊手好閒之徒早被宰了個乾淨，繼起的又得直接或間接給「海洛因」公司帮忙，而農民仍跑到山頂同石頭鬥爭。少爺們去調弄佃戶家的女人，抽抽「老海」，打打牌，至於充當過皇家將校的老爺呢，所說是整天撕住「丫環」玩，而又專吸鴉片的。</p>
<p>如此一番天地，不知是否可以拿來同中古世紀的歐洲相比……我記起在什麽地方見過的一幅畫：一個跪着的女人，頭髮披在背後，雙手向上伸開，眼睜得大大的，痛苦的仰望着天空……</p>
<p>畫馬上同面前的景物融合在一起了。</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>一正當他看那菜單時候，她就坐在他旁邊；不久僕歐就送了幾盤菜和一瓶香檳酒來，放在人面前。瓶塞小心地拔去「土伯爵」向來不許香檳酒瓶塞響呌的；發泡的酒流入杯內去。其他姑娘底酒菜都是很簡單的，她們暗中用肘觸那男伴；我的注意力也完全集中在這一對男女身上了。娜麗把她那蒼白面孔托在一隻手裏，別一隻手則像遺忘般放在一滿杯酒底下；「土伯爵」則滿意地忙着吃他那燒雀并默默地喝那香檳酒。</p>
<p>「你不吃麽，娜麗？」最後他問。</p>
<p>她搖搖頭。</p>
<p>他凝視了她一會。「你不吃、也好，」他安靜地接下去說，「那也由你！」然後他自己斟了酒，繼續吃他的夜餐。</p>
<p>姑娘此時拿起杯來在唇邊，彷彿口渴得很，一口氣就喝完了。她頭還是懶懶地支在手上沒有抬起來，她拿起酒瓶，懸空向空杯內斟去；酒慢慢流出來了，漸漸在杯底生起泡沫。她的眼睛用一種失望表情看着酒，彷彿看她的生命從瓶子中流出來一樣。她簡直也不管酒泡沫從杯口流下桌面并從桌面流到地下去，惟有另一隻手還緊緊地按着那絲樣的黑頭髮。</p>
<p>「美人，」個初生鬍子的幼年學生把空杯伸向她像求乞樣子，並低聲說，「請把你們的餘灑倒點給我喝吧！」</p>
<p>娜麗沒有抬起頭，但我看見她的嘴角急速動了一下。</p>
<p>「做甚麽，「後輩」，你要甚麽？」一個老學生問，以前他一直忙着喝酒；「呵哈，這樣暴殄天物！」他突然喊起來，並拉住姑娘底臂膀。</p>
<p>「土伯爵」祇向側面讓一下，當香檳酒從他身邊流到地下去時候。「隨她去吧，」他說，「她的人性是這樣的。不是麽，娜麗？」他添加兩句說，一面對她微笑着，「我們兩個都是會暴殄天物的！」</p>
<p>她把瓶子放在桌上，帶着無來由的怨恨看了他一眼。然後她站起來，走向那通往大廳的門去。但他也跟着跳起來。一種勉強壓住的憤怒表現在他那清秀而整齊的面容上面。「你幹甚麽的！」他低聲說，並粗暴地抓住她的臂膀。她站住，沒有摔開他的手，祇用閃光的黑眼睛質問地輕蔑地凝視他。他還抓住她一會，後來才抽回他的手，笑了一聲，又坐在桌旁，并慢慢地把瓶里的餘酒倒在杯中。——我看見娜麗經過大廳底門從跳舞的人當中消逝了。</p>
<p>我心血沸騰起來；我所在的地方把甚麽都看到了。過一會之後，我就離開談話的朋友，到大廳裏去等她。</p>

<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>自蔣委員長兼任禁烟總監以來，禁烟之政令，確有雷厲風行之概，寖假而上海禁烟委員會成立矣，寖假而各省市縣之禁烟分會成立矣，禁吸禁糧，禁販禁運，禁烟之成績，誠可驚人，惟吾人細思，醫家對於禁烟，最有重要之恊助，烟民之檢驗也，烟瘾之戒除也，幾無一不需醫家爲之，然余以為醫家除檢驗戒除之外，尤有較大之協助，卽於診病之際如發現病家有吸食鴉片之事，應向官廳報告是也。</p>
<p>或曰：醫有應守之德，保守病人之秘密，醫德之一也，凡無故洩漏病入之秘密者，法律上處以徒刑，同道間羞與為伍，子之所陳，母乃干犯刑章，累及醫德乎？應之曰：事有大小，行有經權，權而衡之，斯為得矣。夫禁烟者，民族盛衰之所係，守秘者一個人禍福之所關，以大小論之，前者為大而後者為小矣！且再聞意大利之新刑律有謂醫家於診病之際發見病人酗酒，應向官廳報告，否則處以罰衆矣！誠以酒之為物，足以擾亂治安，病人之酗酒，病人之秘密也，而意大利醫家不以守秘之故，使其影響於社會之治安，誠可謂知所輕重矣、吸鴉片之影響於民族百千倍於酒之影響於治安乎？吾又聞之，醫家之發現傳染病也，應向官廳報告，否則處以罰金矣！誠以疫癘之傳染，足以危害公衆，病人之病症，病人之秘密也，而醫家不以守秘之故，使其影響於公衆之衛生，誠可謂知所經權矣，矧鴉片之影響於民族，百千倍於傳染病之影響於衛生乎？夫竟大利之視治安之擾亂，不下於疫癘之傳染，故以報告之責付之醫師，吾則謂鴉片之害人甚於疫癘，發見烟民，如發見患傳染病之病人，烏在其不可也？其於醫秘之則庸有忤乎？</p>
<h3 id="c195">建議衛生署應亟設醫學補習特班之芻言 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 陳藹雲</p>
<p>本文曾經鄙人具文呈請衛生署，茲奉署批第二五七號，應予留備參考，用將呈意秒録露佈，藉告同道之留意斯事者。（藹雲附識）</p>
<p>記得在民國十九年中政會議席上，中委戴季陶氏，曾有擴充醫藥衛生敎育提案，內容有「……按諸吾國社會，需要醫學人材旣若是之迫切，勢不能不先事解决目前供應於求之培植問題，而他方面又須顧及逐漸可以提高程度，以實現完全普及醫藥之一切學制系統亦均能適合現情，可免偏廢之弊，其擴充之目的，以求卅年問，達到人口每一千人，有醫生一人之目的，……醫學衛生之學問發展，人才普及，以救民族之衰微，而在民生之基礎也，……現在人民生活困難，卽中人之家，亦不易培植一醫學生，……」戴先生因吾國新醫人材之缺乏，欲想籍着政府力量，以期達到國內科學醫普及的實現，所以有這個提案，可是事實上，事過境遷，消息沉寂，仍不過是畫餅充飢，案卷裏多幾項墨跡罷了。</p>
<p>再觀現有已經衛生署登記合格醫師之數量而言，全國祗有五六千人，而要在號稱四萬萬人口的吾國，以這點少數的翳師去分配，好比車薪杯水，若要談到新醫普及，要想於卅年內，達到每一千人中有醫師一人的實現，眞不知要幾個卅年呢？</p>
<p>吾國以農立國，農民佔國民中最大的數目，農民康健，是强國的根本，這樣看來，農村醫藥衛生是很重要的，農村醫師的需要，當然更較迫切，但是因為新醫數量太少的緣故，總難於普及分配到鄉鈸，在平時還不見什麼困難，萬一國內遇着時症流行起來，那就要感到無法救濟之嘆了。綜合看來，旣然吾國醫師的需要，有這樣的迫切，而新醫的產生，却又是那樣的不易，如此重要的問題，當局為何竟一點兒沒有顧慮到呢</p>
<p>在新醫人材如此缺乏，與農村需要新醫人材如此迫切之今日，我想還有一種補救的培植辦法，就是在過去，極短期限，曾有一度變通給證條例，可是事實上適合這條例，因過期而未曾登記的醫師，尙有許多，這種醫師，雖無豐富約學理，却有相當的經騐，雖不能與正式醫校畢業者，並駕齊驅，但是較毫無科學頭腦的玄醫，總要高出一籌。這班已有相當新醫學的知識和技術，而年在卅歲左右的人，大都在鄉村，得着相當信用，現在為了沒有登記，勢將停業，這樣不但他們的生計，以及他們全家老小的衣食，都要發生問題，就是鄉村裏已經感着，醫不够的，豈非格外要發生恐慌麼，况且這班醫生，一旦失業，要敎他另外營生，像這樣大的年齡，恐屆有些不可能吧，那末政府當局，情理上總應該想個法子救濟哩！</p>
<p>我的意思，假使衛生署設一個「醫學補習特班，」招收這班醫生入學訓練，予以補習機會，一方面不特可以補充醫師需要數量之不足，且得收事半功倍之成效，借此也可普及分配一部分鄉鎭，協助政府提倡農村衛生，以救民族之衰微，他方面籍此可以救濟這班人，不致失業，以維持他們全家的生計，這樣對於民族，民生，以及農村醫藥衛生，都有不少的利益。這種的辦法，可以說是比變通給蹬條例的辦法，還要勝一籌，所以衛生署之應亟設立醫學補習特班，實為解决目前民族健康，救濟新醫缺乏提倡農村醫藥衛生之一緊要工作。</p>
<p>講到怎樣辦法呢，最好由內政部衛生署，與全國經濟委員會衛生處，聯合組織，先從江浙二省試辦第一期醫學補習特班，其入學資格，祇限適合於變通給證條例，因過期而未曾登記，並須曾獲有民國十九年至二十二年問之地方官署公安局證明文件，證明確有醫師能力者，准予免試入學，訓練以一年為期，期滿考試及格，給予補字醫師體書，許其執業，際此國家財政艱難之際，似乎可以酌收學費，及講義費，實習費，膳宿費等，以作該班開辦經費，因為祗有一年期限之訓練，其經濟負擔，每人至多亦不過二百五十元左右，諒必每個學員，總還可以能够負擔，點數目罷。其師資一層，則可聘請衛生署經秀會衛生處及中央三處的高級人員據任之，這樣，我想第一期，衛生署很可以先試辦一下，關於這種的計劃，前輩宋國省醫師龐京周醫師也曾在醫藥評論上講起過，夏蒼霖醫師也曾在醫事彙刊上發表過，其成效將來必很有可觀呢。</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>意大利以法西斯主義治國，乃其防癆工作，最近亦純粹取法西斯式，一切防癆之機關及設施，完全聽命於中央，現已實施其防癆命令曰：非中央已獲有病家正式之經過報告，凡翳院或診所，不許收容及診察一切癆病患者。又患癆病之母親，不許在家養病，否則其兒星應立卽避往他處，以隔離之。病家在正式報告一星期之內，應立往療養院養病，其住宅應施以消毒。而各醫院對於實施防癆及治療工作，均有一律之規定及標準。如米蘭省佔地二千八百零一立方千尺密達，共有二百萬居民，內有廿三處防癆指導所，六所療養院，共有二千五百床位，又十七所癆病醫院，共有二千九百二十五床位，此外尙有公共疾病保險機關附屬之癆病醫院，有病床三千個，三所預防癆病療養院，共計一千個床位。凡防癆指導所，均有愛克司光人工氣胸具及檢驗病菌之設備，此外尙有極完全之消毒器具，及痰液消毒設施，大都與各大醫院均有連帶之關係。其私人開業醫師，則大率與各防癆指導所之專家翳師，共同合作焉。</p>
<p>防癆工作經濟之來源，在意大利全境，凡每星期甲，各種交通車票，均例外增加五生的。此外有數處之博物院，在一定之日期，增加門票十生的。在米蘭省，每個居民，每年應納防癆費一個力而。（合華洋二角）淤一九三一年，米蘭省曾舉行防癆賣花一次，共收入三百四十六萬力而。近數年來，其防癆成績，非常優良，癆病之死亡率，已逐漸减少，在一九三〇年米省有二千六百十三人因癆病而死亡，在一九三二年則為二千三百四十三人云。</p>
<p>以我國之社會情形而論，其防癆工作，較之任何國家，更為重要，自無疑義。去年吳市長李廷安顏福慶諸氏及家嚴等，有中國防癆協會之發起，自為當今之急圖。惟對經濟之收入，以招集會員費充任。竊以為與其招集少數之會員，且大都出於介紹人之面情，卽使今年入會，明年亦不能强其再行加入，卽使有人加入，每年亦須費去各方若干之時間與精神，不若師意之故智，對於防癆經費，廣行徵收，每人所費極小，而事關公益，民衆方面，當然樂為協助，則集腋成裘，車半功倍，經費充足，則我國防癆工作，定能增加其效能，數年以後，不難與各國並駕齊驅，質之協會諸公，以為如何。（寄自德國漢堡大學肺病研究院）</p>
<h3 id="c197">便秘與瀉藥 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之六—</p>
<p>美國醫學博士克林登寗（Lopan　Clendening）在他的名著「人體」（The　Human　Bcdy）中有一段論述「便秘」的文字，頗為警闢，茲特引述如下：</p>
<p>有的病人說：「我患便秘症已近十年了。有的說一我的憂鬱症和連續的疲倦都是由於便秘的緣故。若干年前，一個倫敦醫生著文發表，</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>說便秘可以造成神經衰弱，胃部潰瘍，胸部毒瘤，甚至可以造成肺癆。他說，誰都應該把結腸割除。但他却不把他自己的結腸割除，因為他說他的結腸是很好的結腸。多數醫生都相信便秘是一切病症的根源</p>
<p>根據個人的經騐，我覺得這是不可靠的。到我這裏來就診便秘症的病人，實際上大多數並無便秘的症角。舉一個例為證。某日，一個病人走來說，他患便秘，雖天天吃瀉藥，仍無效騐，叫我設法療治。為試騐這病人是否眞患便秘起見，我叫他吃下一塊不透明的食物，以便用愛克司光察看消化的經過。這是在星期一上午十點鐘。下午四點鐘，病人又來；察看的結果，那食物已離胃入腸。我關照病人，叫他晚上停服瀉藥，以便計算食物消化的自然速率，又叫他於第二天中午再來。這一回，那食物已轉入橫大腸中。我又關照他，叫他晚上別服瀉藥，於第三天再來。這一回，那食物已不在腸中了。於是我問他：「今天早晨你通過大便了吧？」他似吃驚的神氣回答道：「是的，眞奇怪，像這麼自然的大便，數年來今天還是第一次啦。」數年來，這病人每天服瀉藥，都想不到不服瀉藥大便反而格外通順。這是因為瀉藥使腸的內壁常受刺戟，因此發生的飽滿的意識使他覺得他的腸管永遠沒有空虛的時候。</p>
<p>這樣，服瀉藥倒是造成便秘的原因了。</p>
<p>讀了這段文宇，我們可以明白，診斷便秘症的眞假是醫生職務上一伴重要的事情，與此相關的就是瀉藥之不宜輕妄服用了。</p>
<p>許多瀉藥，都是偶然發見的。一種叫做Epsom　Salts的瀉藥（化學成分是硫酸鎂），是一六一八年在唐斯（Dons）山上一個叫做Epsom的泉水中發見的。據傳說，一個名叫佛葛斯（Henry　Wicks）的農人把羣牛趕到唐斯山上的泉水中喝水。奇怪得很，羣牛喝了水一口，都不肯再喝。他自己嘗一口，原來味兒鹹又苦。當然，他把這奇怪的發見說給鄰人聽。就地的人們就開始把這泉水作療治皮膚潰瘍與酸痛的外擦藥用，居然有效。一個貴族，名叫腦夫（Dudley　North）的，首先試騐把它當作內服藥用，發見它有通便的功效，便著文發表他的發見。於是Epsom　Salts就成為當時通行的瀉藥了。</p>
<p>Phenalphthalein是一種新的瀉藥。說起這瀉藥發見的歷史，倒是頗有趣味的。在成為瀉藥以前，它本是化學實騐室中的通用材料，因為它具有一種性質，就是：遇鹼變紅色，遇酸不變色。若干年前，匈牙利政府制定一條法規：白酒須攙和以許phenolphthaein，藉以試騐酒內有否攙雜劣貨。這法規施行後，匈牙利全境竟蔓延流行的痢疾，這表示業被視為無害的Phenolphthalein却具有强烈的通便的性質。同時，施行「淸水變酒一的把戲的魔術師，在施術之後，輒患腹瀉。原來壺中的淸水合有炭酸鈵，接受從壺中倒出來的淸水的空玻璃杯給預先放入幾滴Phenolphthalein，含鹼的水碰到Phenolphthalein，自然變成像酒一般的紅色了。每一回假酒做成，施術者自己喝一口，故意裝出嘗到酒味的神氣，以眩惑觀衆。這就是他接連喝進幾口瀉藥，腹瀉當然是難免的結果。Phenolphthaein可以和入糖果和橡皮糖中，所以它是一種便於小孩服用的瀉藥。</p>
<p>據克林登寗博土說，最自然的通便劑不是任何藥物而是蔬菜。因為蔬菜所含的纖維素不受消化，却留在腸中促進腸的排劑運動。實在有利無弊的瀉藥，一只有這一種。</p>

<p>本病必發的症候。就是聲音嘶嘎。在重症的時候。竟可完全失聲。且有咳嗽頻發。若生潰瘍。則有粘液性膿性咳痰。患者感覺多少的嚥下疼痛。假使在喉頭入口部發生浸潤或崩壞。則來高度的嚥下因難。有時且來誤嚥。當病人咳嗽或發聲的時候。輒感喉內疼痛。呼吸困難除在炎性浮腫顯著的時候。通常是沒有的。此外病人常訴體溫昇騰。我們若由外方壓觸喉頭部。病人往往感覺疼痛。有時可以觸知腫脹。這是因為併發續發性軟骨膜炎的緣故。咽頭的變化。則為粘膜現出著明的貧血蒼白色。這也是本病一徊特有的症候。喉頭內的變化。則為粘膜發生結核性的浸潤及結核性的潰瘍。所以大凡肺結核患者。若是牠的病勢進行。則喉頭結核所發的浸潤組織。失去抵抗力而行崩壞。成一平坦潰瘍。其大者有時可達豌豆大。此時患者大半有嚥下困難的痛苦。此外可足注意的。就是有多數患者。在喉頭由血行發生黃色粟粒大小的小結節。不久旋卽破潰。而成匐行性淺表潰瘍。此際若行咳痰檢查。則常有結核桿菌的存在。本病貴在早期診斷及早期治療。但是早期診斷頗非易易。蓋因牠的症候。若聲音斯嗄。嚥下困難，及窒息症狀等等。在他種喉頭疾病亦是常有的。况且喉頭結核大半合併急性或慢性加答兒症狀。切不可將此等症狀悮為肺結核的加答兒的症狀。其他更若梅毒，腫瘍，及有嘶嗄的神經性疾患。尤宜和牠鑑別。比較確實的診斷厥為喉頭鏡的檢查。故肺結患者。應當常由專科醫師旋行喉頭鏡的檢查。察其有無局部的病變。切勿失却早期診斷及早期治療的機會。是為至要。</p>
<p>喉頭結核的治療方法。非常複雜。不可概論。因為本病多為肺結核的合併症。所以首先應當施行肺結核一般的攝生法及治療法。攝取多量的滋養料。注意空氣的調節。至於本病的局所療法。則可分為藥品療法，外科療法及光線療法的三種。藥品療法中則有藥液注入法，藥液塗布法，藥品腐蝕法，藥粉吹撒法及藥液吸入法。外科療法中，則有鉗子切除法，電氣燒灼法及氣管切開術。光綫療法中當以有直接照射喉頭裝置的人工太陽燈及奧國維也納醫家惠士來氏所發明的燈。較為有效。大可一試。</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>喉痛</p>
<p>扁桃腺炎與喉炎　扁桃腺生於喉內兩旁不時發炎，每次發炎喉就痛。發炎時扁桃腺就紅腫也常上雜白點。體溫不時升到一百零一度。隨扁桃腺炎全喉部也不斷同時發炎。生扁桃腺的原因為喉部普通細菌乘感冒而活勁。發炎經數日之久便漸漸恢復常態。洽療扁桃腺炎，重的宜臥床休息，輕的不必。飲食宜擇流質類。外加嗽喉藥如，四分之一雙養水（雙養水四分之一，水四分之三混合），或百分之二重硼酸鈉液嗽喉一日數次亦可。一年到頭發炎的扁桃腺宜割去以免病菌由扁桃腺侵入心臟致起心臟炎，或侵入骨節而成風濕痛或骨節炎。</p>
<p>膿性扁桃圍炎　喉門的旁邊，扁桃腺之周圍病菌常由扁桃腺侵入而發炎，成膿腫。患者覺到喉部一邊腫脹疼痛，下嚥困難。張口查看見喉部扁桃腺與周圍紅腫。患者一兩日內也多覺到發冷發熱。這種喉痛在未成膿前治療法為：身體休息，頸部冷熱敷。旣成膿後須割開放膿。</p>
<p>白喉或稱喉痧　現在大部分人民都曉得白喉是一種非常危險的毛病。平常人雖然懼怕白喉，但懼怕自是懼怕，有時病臨身體尙不自知。白喉常於不知不覺之中臨身，平常患者第一所感覺的是喉痛。查騐喉部有灰白色膜，直接用顯微鏡或培養後察騐可找到白喉菌。患者身體發熱約一百至一百零三度。注意白喉是與患者接近傳染來的。一有了白喉第一急務是注射白喉抗毒素血淸。注射越早越好。在抗毒血淸發明前，患白喉者平均每三個人死去一個。自從用了白喉抗毒素血淸死亡率就大見减低，大概每十個或二十個息者平均死亡一個。還有一層務須注意的卽注射抗毒血淸早死亡率低，注射晚死亡率高。據統計患白喉者於患病的第一日內注射白喉抗毒毒素血淸，死亡率為千分之十五。病起後第二日內注射的死亡率為千分之三十四。第三日注射的死亡率為千分之六十九。第四日內注射的死亡率為千分之一百零九。第五日內注射的死亡率為千分之一百五十。不注射的死亡率為千分之三百五十。現在來比比：不注射的死亡率比第一日內注射的高二十五倍。第五日內注射的死亡率比第一日內注射的高十倍。第四日內注射的死亡率比第一日內注射的高約七倍。第三日內注射的死亡率比第一日內注射的高四倍半。第二日內注射的死亡率比第一日內注射的高二倍餘。白喉致患者於死不是由於喉痛，是由於白喉菌毒素侵入血內損壞心臟，或阻塞呼吸道使患者悶死。總而言之洽療白喉喉痛第一是注射白喉抗毒血淸，最好於患病的第一日內施行。斷不可當為普通喉痛治。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第六節　腎臟結核</p>
<p>除開尿之詳細檢查外，對於本症之究竟認識，還有兩種檢查手續，是萬萬省不了的。第一是膀胱鏡檢視法。這對於粘膜部分呈現何種狀態，馬上卽可水落石出的。（膀胱結核症，大半是由腎臟結核向下侵襲而致的；故勝胱方面結核性病變之尋得，間接卽可為腎臟結核之證明。）對於輸尿管之能通過與否？以及腎臟結核之屬於右腎或左腎？抑兩種俱被侵襲？這幾個重要問題，祇須行輸尿管測管送入法一手續，卽可加以肯定或否定的。第二是X光之檢視。對於腎臟之形式和大小，以及石灰性硬化的病灶之證明，都要視此為轉移的。這兩種檢查法，都應該由專門醫師擔任方行：否則是非不分明，幾乎和指鹿為馬，無異了！</p>
<p>關於本症的洽療，在初期的時候，可無須行使手術。他的方針，大致和尋常的結核症（慢性型式）慢性腎臟炎相彷彿的。鐵勃固靈的注射，有時是很見功効的。金屬劑治療極易刺激腎臟，須禁忌。X光治療亦無効。如果本症在進行或擴大了，那末，我們應該核查另一側之腎如何，假使完全良好，則可將病腎用手術割除；這一方面的成績，有時是很好的。至於病者之飲食起居等種種，則與尋常肺結核症同。</p>

<h3 id="c202">被壓迫者的互助 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>二十六日加爾喀答電；甘地今日要求三萬五千萬印人，資助紅十會，赴阿比西尼亞救濟，並稱：「墨索里尼威脅全世界之有色人種，實使印度不能漠然置之，印度雖非參戰國，但旣係國聯之會員國，自應援助另一會員國」云。</p>
<p>意阿的衝突，已不只是國與國間的紛爭，而已牽涉到人種問題。甘地起而為有色人種呼籲，其憤激之概，溢於言表。聞印人對於阿比西尼亞，表示熱烈的同情。這形勢，將直接影響於英國的殖民及東菲政策。</p>
<p>人種觀念，在世界人類往來接觸日密的現在，仍然存在於各種族的腦裏。二十世紀的世界，顯然是白種人的天下。因此，世人便發生所謂種族戰爭的恐怖。不少人預料今後的戰爭，將由國的糾紛，演變而為種族的對立。</p>
<p>其實這也未免過於杞憂。將來世界會不會發生種族戰爭，當然不能預斷。但在目前，同種族自相踐踏的現象，還是到處可以看見。只要有利害關係，就是同種帮助異種，也不算是奇事。這豈但各自為謀的有色人種是如此，卽素以團結性强固的白種人，都是一樣。故我以為種族戰爭，假定能發生，離今日遠很遙遠。</p>
<p>將來不可避免的，倒是被壓迫者與壓迫者的爭鬥。現在世界，大別之，可分為被壓迫者與壓迫者的二大階級。被壓迫者卽是一般弱小民族，壓迫者便是所謂列強。後者以犧牲前者的利益，為自存之道。前者則只能在後者的控制及宰割下，苟延殘喘。這兩階級的對立，是無法調和的。將來一旦破裂，大爭鬥就立刻會發生。這是被壓迫者反抗强權的光榮戰爭。現今印度之對阿比西尼亞表同情，與其說是基於人種觀念，母寗說是弱小民族的一種互助行為，較為確切。</p>
<p>種族戰爭是形成於褊狹的人種觀念。被壓迫者與壓迫者的爭鬥，這意義才是偉大的。因為眞正的人類平等，必在被壓迫者解放之後，方能實現。孫中山先生說，中國要求自由平等，須聯合世界弱小民族，共同奮鬥。這認識是十分淸楚的。中國未來的出路，或許就在這裏。</p>
<h3 id="c203">靑燈與夢 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 夏蔭</p>
<p>（一）靑燈</p>
<p>每夜，抹亮檯角的靑色的燈，一個困惑的感慨，就會從心底輕輕的吐出來，這寂眞的流浪生涯，年靑的生命已給磨折成如一界靑色的燈，收斂了熊熊的烈焰：漸漸的遠離了那些鮮艷歡笑的日子了。</p>
<p>這靑燈，伴隨我過了多少艱難的日子！在它靑悠悠的光影下，我從沒有傍怠耕耘生活的秣糧，和許多年靑人所有的美夢。長些艱苦的勞作，磨折了我的天眞。對於人世，對於生活，都展開一幅朦朧的黑影，橫遮着我所要盼望的幸福的禁地。使我不由不痛切前途的渺漠與現實的殘慘。這些雖然都只有撩起我的憤忿，轉用如火的眼瞳去敵視那一切卑污的現形：并不對生活屏膝叩頭；不讓這顆鮮赤的心玷染一點瑕疵，傲岸如雪嶺寒梅，播散自已的孤芳在冰天雪地</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的大野之中。</p>
<p>是的，我接受一切人世投來的苦難，用自己的剛强去耕耘生活，取得生活。不歆羨人家的幸福，而祝福自己的努力與苦鬥。他人自然難免把我看作是不長進的懦者，一個平庸無為的笨人。只是，我有我自己的見解，理想。這些卑淺勢利的奚落都不能動搖我的意念。對於自己，我非常明白，這平席的生涯中，縱使有一些渺小的泡沬微浪，都包捲着許多可歌可泣的苦鬥在那兒，那是我的血的昇華，汗的昇華，全人格的昇華。在自己，都是値得驕傲的。</p>
<p>這不是誇大自慰的强辯。人原不比失了智慧的耕牛，忍耐，耕耘的目的，并不在一短時間的憩息。他有更遠大的理想，他要在燥裂荒莽的田土里耕耘出滿畦的靑苗和能救飢餓的稻實來。</p>
<p>雖然，生涯究竟是苦的。我不會忘却這日子的苦難，已漸漸遠離了那些鮮艷歡笑的日子，年靑的生命已給磨折成如一界靑色的燈，收斂了熊熊的烈熖，讓熱情藏在心里。自然，對於這艱難的日子，逐漸變化的生命，也不免撩起心底的傷痛之感。</p>
<p>可是，艱苦的日子帶來艱苦的生涯。人生原是向着脚下伸展開去的路程爬去的。這路程縱使崎嶇險巇，也得咬緊牙關爬行上去！</p>
<p>就讓那些鮮艷歡笑的日子遠離開去罷。永遠伴隨靑燈，用自己的剛强去耕耘生活，取得生活！</p>
<p>（二）夢</p>
<p>伴隨我過着長些流浪的寂寞日子，是那永遠做不完結的夢。這些夢都是這麼平凡，老是一個調子，夢的是遍宇宙都開滿媽紅翠綠的花。</p>
<p>在看淸一切以後，也常常橫着心問着自己。</p>
<p>—為愛惜自家的靑春，不能把這縹緲的夢結東的麼？</p>
<p>自然，日子久了我漸漸感到內心的悒憂，像無端在心頭織縛着一重軟膩膩的蛛絲，縱有碎鼎拔山之力也無法把這纖微的東西扯去。於是，不由自己的輕輕吐出一聲嘆息，我惋惜自己的生命力原也有着軟弱的因素。然而——</p>
<p>—山鷹的戰歌周然唳亮，風雨來時，牠總還忘不掉和平的山林呢。</p>
<p>戰塲上的勇武戰士，都還有他的「戰地之夢」，我雖倔强，又那能逃此本能？</p>
<p>人生原是一幕爭鬥的舞台面。就永世也無遍宇宙開滿嫣紅翠綠的花的時候哪！</p>
<p>對於自己，固須好好的加以愛惜，可是，也莫忘記人的生命力原也有着軟弱的因素呢。</p>

<p>這時房子里都空着人，不論大大小小男男女女的全逃在門前曠塲上：講故事的講故事，說笑話的說笑話，也有人在報告一些從茶館里或街頭巷尾所聽來的，不可靠的新聞。金寳叔却獨自個兒據着一隻白木方凳，在揀着鹽炒豆呷白干，他的老婆是坐在傍邊靑石上喂孩子的粥。</p>
<p>還有許多大孩子是大家拿了一個玻璃瓶或鴨蛋壳，到草坪里去捕螢火蟲。</p>
<p>「小心蛇蟲百足；捕你們魂靈頭的螢火蟲，捕了來你們拿去當飯吃罷！」婦人們這樣喝叱着自已的孩子，可是那些頑皮的孩子那里肯聽，這里不捉，奔到那面天羅瓜架底下又去捉了。</p>
<p>「小……東人……闖下……了………」那專好打聽閒事的阿金正從鎭市上喝飽了酒回來，嘴里却哼着不成腔的「三娘敎子」。</p>
<p>「你開心呀！家里明天的早飯米還在天上飛，你却還要去祭黃湯，祭尿！」他的老婆正倚在一株香椿樹上，對他白了一眼，恨恨的說。</p>
<p>「哈哈！明天，管他媽的，絕了今天再打算！」他說着就在門檻上坐了下來；「你們知道嗎？今天銀狗家捉住了一個偷南瓜的賊。」</p>

<p>— 摩加</p>
<p>一想起南方的家</p>
<p>可追慕的故鄉的五月天哪！在山的盡頭，海的迢遙的盡頭，南方溫和的氣候，那邊有明朗的天，優美的麗景，雖然夏是走到末梢了，但在那邊，正是遲熟的龍眼季節，遲開的橙子飄香的季節，以及遲熟的紅葡萄串上市的季節，這攜甜味的也許酸味的菓子都是伴着你消除長夏的唯一的禮品的。當正午到來的時分，屋子里是較悶一點，於是帶枝一把，或者龍眼一把，和着一張竹席子，舖在家屋前幾株榕樹葉蔭下，緩緩地剝着龍眼的殼子，荔子的殼子，啖着啖着，扇子大概是用不著，風已從原野上一陣陣吹來，吹起橙子的芳芬。而想到龍眼，便想起龍眼一樣含着蜜汁的一段的溫柔的情思來哪，那時，鄰舍居有一位年輕的娘兒，她家種着一蔟古老的龍眼，終是最遲開花，最遲結果，等到爛熟的時侯，龍眼節也過了她的才正可以採摘，個子特別大，也特別有味兒，而這年輕的娘兒，她自己的名字恰好叫龍眼，因為她有一雙烏艷的，圓溜溜的像龍眼核的眼珠，和像龍眼的色那麼黑的皮膚色，她又自小便格外嗜愛龍眼，他的龍眼姊的名字就被人們叫慣了。她家裡每逢採一次龍眼時，她終是自己帶幾把送到我家來。龍眼姊，龍眼姊，天氣這樣熱，你還自己出來跑，留給你自己用，我們業吃得不少了。我懷着幾乎調侃的口吻說着，她有些忸怩的站着，輕盈地笑着，龍眼似的珠子閃着嫵媚的烏艷的光彩，你老是欲打趣，說着她抿了一下嘴唇，把手里一把龍眼扔向我身上，便走了。瞧着她那俏俊的背影，心靈不禁動了動，我的確讚美她的樸質的笑，純眞的說話，可是我不能輕浮地告訴任何人心中的秘密，這秘密我祗有讓它靜靜地隱藏在一深心底處之後，我離家第一年間，龍眼姊已經由爹娘的主意，嫁給一個陌生者了，我的無人知的思念也成為無人知的永生的遺憾。三年前，曾一度回去，凑巧龍眼姊也在我回去中回來娘家，但她已抱了一個孩子了，這還是夏天，我看見她坐在自己的家門口，那是傍晚了，她撇開胸膛給孩子喂乳，龍眼姊，眞快啦，你還認得我？她有點羞澀的望着我笑，我想起年輕時候未出嫁的龍眼姊，我撩起自己無人知的淡忘的思念，我暗暗為一個人喪失靑春而無端黯然了。現在我又離開家鄉數年龍眼姊該又是養了幾個孩子吧。</p>
<p>二午夜</p>
<p>入夜屋子里還是又熱又悶，沒有一點風，外邊的風，是有的，但為了窗格子小，又朝北，吹不進來，人坐着不動，奐汗水一樣流不停，祗好滅了燈，想消滅一點火光的熱氣，但燈一熄，蚊子可得意了，嗡嗡地大鬧着，覷空兒往身上狠命一咬，等驅去這個，那個又釘在背上了。沒法，惟有溜出來，剛走出門，一陣凉爽的風迎面吹來，我的感覺頓然鬆下來，呼了口輕快的氣，外邊實在像另一個世界，屋子里比起來簡直成為蒸籠那麼可怕。順着石子小路走着。周遭靜悄悄的，夜是深沉了，天上一隻大月亮，銀色的光把大地溶瀉在水銀的蕩漾中，星是很稀疏，隨便坐在一塊草坪上，看着那自濛濛的天色，一種輕脆的情調，我的心也因此是輕的鬆，可是當那偶然從半空中飛過去一聲孤雁的叫唳，雖是飛遠了，但凄凉的感覺却冲不開地停留在我心坎上，而我終因有太關心天上的月，，閃眼星星，尤貧好那輕凉的風，常常楞坐在這空寂如溶化了的中夜心，有時就是月沉星浴也還不肯離去，也就時時因此被午夜的賜給一點的小病的苦惱。</p>

<p>那潔凈的白色的一座大屋子里，看護婦們正在這麼地說：「呵，又夜晚了。」</p>
<p>她們穿着白色的衣裳，戴着白色的帽子。臉兒和皮膚和頭髮，都不是屬於白色的。她們很靜嫻，像一羣棲息在巢里的小烏兒。</p>
<p>「呵，又夜晚了。」</p>
<p>「是呵。苓醫師說，還過半個鐘點，要是三號里的產婦還不生產，一定要給她施手術了。」</p>
<p>「唔。亞門。」</p>
<p>「亞門。」劃着十字。她們兩個子分開了。</p>

<p>一陣凄凉的苦痛的喊叫，明朗地在房間里廻旋。</p>
<p>「看護小姐，痛呵，救我，……產婦的臉色非常蒼白，像給人家用小刀子在腿上戳了一刀似的，在床上輾轉。</p>
<p>「看護小姐，救救她吧。」陪着那產婦的一個老年婦人，那麼悲悒地抆着眼淚說。</p>
<p>「別叫她在床上打滾呵！一會兒醫生就要來了。」她把白的棉花，紗布，還有那白亮的盤子，白亮的鉗子，橡皮手套，都安置好了。然後，推開門走出去。</p>
<p>而，產婦的苦痛的喊叫，原是像烟突里的烟一般的不息地在冒出來。</p>
<p>「救命呵。」</p>
<p>一位看看婦說：「主呵，救她吧！」</p>
<p>苓醫師推開了三號病室的門。有七八個年靑的看護婦，都那麼靜嫻的跟着他。</p>
<p>產婦的臉色幾乎像醫師們穿的那件白衣裳一樣白了。</p>
<p>「先生，請救救她吧。」那個老年婦人畏縮地開口了。</p>
<p>「唔。」苓醫師點了點腦袋。立在床前看了看產婦的動態。又按了按產婦的脈膊。</p>
<p>「喔，痛，痛，先生，救命吓。」那</p>

<p>個嘴唇也灰白了的產婦突然又狂喊了。</p>
<p>苓醫師看了看產婦後，回過腦袋去跟那些年靑的看護婦說：</p>
<p>「是難產吓。給她作禱告吧。一</p>
<p>於是大家都很有序次的跪下來。連那個唸「阿彌陀佛」的老年婦人也叫她跪下來了。</p>
<p>於是有一個年靑的看護婦唸着禱告詞。</p>
<p>產婦的苦痛更劇了。空氣是浸在嚴肅中。</p>
<p>「亞門。」大家都劃了十字。</p>
<p>禱告完了。而那個產婦的苦痛的喊聲也低啞了。</p>
<p>天亮的時候，看護婦又為產婦作第二次的禱告，在割症室里。</p>
<p>沒有一會兒，有一個看護婦走出門外，跟那個坐在割症室門口的那棹長櫈土的，正在唸「阿彌陀佛」的老年婦人說：</p>
<p>「你的媳婦窒息死了。因為施手術的時問太遲了。」</p>
<p>那末孩子，那個男孩子安好嗎？」老年婦人趕忙問。</p>
<p>「很平安，太太。」</p>
<p>「唔，那倒還幸運！阿彌陀佛！」老年婦人的焦慮似乎减退了。她忽兒又釘住了看護婦問：</p>
<p>「喂，看護小姐，剛才我的媳婦換下來的衣服放在那兒？」</p>
<p>「恐怕原是放在病室里吧。有什麼事？」</p>
<p>「唔，給他換衣服的是你嗎？」她的顏色和悅了。</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>「那麼請問你，她的袋子里可有那藏錢的小皮篋嗎？」她的眼淚也乾了。</p>
<p>「那倒不知道。你打算怎樣？太太。」</p>
<p>「我打算買幾塊錢蛋去染紅蛋吓。「</p>
<p>「太太，你們死了人還可染紅蛋嗎？」</p>
<p>「吓，那死的是一個女人吓！算不得什麼的。怎麼不可染紅蛋呢？阿彌陀佛。」老年婦人笑開了嘴接着說：「看護小姐，請你領我去看看那個男小孩可以嗎？哦吓，也許她的袋子里還有錢袋哩。議我先拿了錢袋再去看那個男小孩吧。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Economic Commission Will Convene a Yellow River Management Meeting Today; Representatives from Jiangsu, Shandong, and Other Provinces Will Attend to Discuss Remedial Measures for the Yellow River's Inflow into Jiangsu; Li Yizhi Suggests Five Measures <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to plan for the management of the Yellow River's course, the Economic Commission will convene representatives from Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, the Huai River Regulation Commission, the Yellow River Commission, and experts on the 5th to discuss measures. Expected attendees include Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Department of Construction; Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Department of Construction; Kong Xiangrong, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Commission; Xu Kai, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Regulation Commission; Zheng Zhaojing, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department of said commission; and expert Puteli, among others. It is heard that the commission has already drafted measures for Yellow River management as a basis for discussion. Once approved, the four agencies—the Jiangsu and Shandong provinces, the Huai River Regulation Commission, and the Yellow River Commission—will cooperate to implement them. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission is scheduled to convene officials from Jiangsu and Shandong and responsible personnel from the Huai River and Yellow River Commissions at 3:00 PM on the 5th to discuss remedial measures for the Yellow River's inflow into Jiangsu. Attendees are expected to include Qin Fen, Shen Baixian, Zhang Honglie, Xu Xinwu, Cai Zhen, Kong Xiangrong, Xu Kai, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Regulation Commission, and Zheng Zhaojing, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the Economic Commission, among others. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Commission convened a meeting on the 5th to discuss remedial measures for the Yellow River's inflow into Jiangsu. Due to his busy schedule overseeing the breach closure, Li Yizhi was unable to attend in person but sent a telegram to the Economic Commission on the 4th suggesting five remedial measures: (1) Open a diversion channel eastward from the Dongzhuang Jiangsu dam to reduce excessive water volume; (2) Build a strong southern levee along the Zhaowang River to prevent flooding in Shandong Province; (3) Find a way to divert water entering Nanwang Lake into Dongping Lake; (4) It is advisable not to open the Linjiaba dam; (5) The water flowing from Weishan Lake into the canal should be limited to the capacity under the Jinpu Railway's Second Bridge. The canal from Weishan Lake to the Tanshaji area has a steep slope and can still accommodate 1,000 cubic meters per second. Excess water below Tanshaji should be diverted into Luoma Lake and the Liutang River. Jiangsu should build embankments that do not obstruct the passage of floodwaters into the sea. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Shen Baixian, Director of the Department of Construction, went to Nanjing on the 4th to attend the Yellow River defense meeting held on the 5th.

<p>(Xuzhou) Pei News: After the water from Weishan Lake flowed from the north bank to the south bank, since there is no large current continuing to flow in from the upper reaches, it has stabilized. Furthermore, as the water flowing in has filled up the lake, the total area of the lake has increased, showing signs of a slight drop. If the upper reaches do not continue to flow in, northern Jiangsu can be considered safe. The Tongshan Yellow River Defense Association is still preparing for emergency response to avoid being caught off guard. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Due to the breaches of the Yutai dike in Shandong and the Dasha River, the water level of Weishan Lake increased to 31.0765 meters on the 4th. The southward flow of Yellow River water has become an inevitable fact. The flood control work here has become tense. The Yunhe, Huai, Pi, Gao, and Bao sections of the canal are being defended day and night. The Yi and Shu rivers have also risen, and the embankment breaches in Shuguan are being urgently blocked. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) As the Yellow River water flows south, the danger in northern Jiangsu is concerning. The provincial government has specifically ordered all counties in northern Huai to massively recruit labor for urgent repairs. In addition to strictly guarding the dikes along the rivers and lakes in the counties, it has also ordered the five counties of Huaiyin, Huaian, Baoying, and Gaoyou to immediately begin recruiting labor from today to transport earth to accumulate along the east dike and east slope of Lidong in preparation for emergency response.

<h3 id="e30">International Relations of Austria's Restoration Movement <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The restoration movement in Austria has seen ebbs and flows over the years, almost invariably linked to the German-Italian rivalry for hegemony in Central Europe. Germany aims to seize hegemony in Central Europe and extend its influence to Southern Europe, necessitating the annexation of Austria first. This is why the "Anschluss" (annexation of Austria) has become a key component of the Third Reich's political agenda. Italy, vying for hegemony with Germany and seeking to prevent German expansion southward, must actively expand its influence in Austria. Orchestrating a restoration is one means of implementing this policy. Hence, when Italy adopts an aggressive stance towards Austria, the restoration movement surges; conversely, it temporarily subsides. Last July, a political upheaval occurred in Austria, and Italy immediately assisted Starhemberg in seizing actual power. Starhemberg, a staunch believer in Fascism and a stalwart monarchist, not only has Rome's backing but also serves as a driving force behind the increasingly pronounced trend towards restoration in Austria.</p>
<p>Recently, Germany abandoned the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles by implementing compulsory military service. Britain reneged on its promise to maintain the Anglo-French-Italian united front against Germany, concluding a naval agreement with Germany. Furthermore, negotiations on the Danube Convention have yielded no hope of success after several months. These circumstances allow German influence to expand outwards, further increasing its arrogance. To prevent German expansion southward, Italy is making every effort to bolster the internal restoration movement in Austria. Under Italy's instigation, the Austrian government announced the repeal of the laws exiling the Habsburg imperial family and the return of imperial property that had been confiscated by the state, as preparations for implementing a restoration, while observing the attitudes of various European countries toward this movement. For Austria's restoration is not merely an internal affair of Austria but an international issue as well.</p>
<p>The Little Entente and the Balkan countries, whose fates are intertwined with the issue of Austria's restoration, are all wary of Austria's actively pursuing restoration. Prince Paul of Yugoslavia recently traveled to Romania to meet with King Carol and to discuss methods to strictly prevent Austria's restoration. The Greek Army Chief, Kondylis, also visited Yugoslavia for similar consultations. The semi-official Czech newspaper "Czech News" even published an officially sanctioned commentary, opposing not only the restoration of Austria but also expressing dissatisfaction with Archduke Otto's return to Austria. These smaller nations adopt such a unified stance because the reappearance of the ghost of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire would inevitably endanger their territorial integrity and political independence.</p>
<p>The major European powers, Britain and France, also seem deeply uneasy about the Austrian restoration. France, lately, seeks to use Italy to check Germany. If the Austrian restoration succeeds, it would be tantamount to building a dam on the Danube River, sufficient to prevent German development into Central Europe. However, to maintain its existing influence in Central Europe and its investment markets in Austria, France is also unwilling to let Italy monopolize Austria and prefers to maintain its original alliance with the Little Entente. Thus, France's attitude can be described as a relative opposition to the Austrian restoration. As for British policy, it has always been one of "splendid isolation." Britain has no direct vested interests in Austria's internal affairs. However, if Austria's restoration were to succeed, Italy's influence in Central Europe would make significant progress, posing a considerable threat to British hegemony in Europe. Therefore, Britain is essentially a passive opponent of the Austrian restoration.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of international relations as described above, there is no doubt that the successful restoration of Austria would trigger even more serious disputes in Central Europe. In recent days, Italy has not been fully prepared for its European policy. Consequently, the Austrian restoration movement has not only subsided again on the surface, but the Austrian government also believes that such propaganda hinders the government's freedom of action in the current diplomatic stage and has secretly ordered the suppression of the domestic restoration movement. However, this is only a temporary measure to ease international tensions while Italy focuses on its East African affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e31">League of Nations Passes Two Resolutions; Italian-Ethiopian Case to Be Further Mediated; Neutral Committee Appointed for Arbitration; Report Due by September; Meanwhile, Britain, France, and Italy to Negotiate Under Treaty <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Thanks to the tireless efforts of British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Anthony Eden and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, the League of Nations today overcame one of the most difficult hurdles in its history after Italy and Ethiopia expressed their willingness to abide by the draft resolution on the peaceful resolution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. Reuters' correspondent in Addis Ababa first reported that the Ethiopian King had accepted the League of Nations' mediation plan, greatly relieving League of Nations officials. The news spread like wildfire, instantly dispelling the anxiety among the general public caused by Ethiopia's delayed response. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had previously telegraphed his acceptance of the resolution. After formally receiving Ethiopia's reply, the League of Nations Council held a public meeting at 7:00 PM and formally passed the following two resolutions. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Resolution 1:</p>
<p>The Council of the League of Nations, having adopted a resolution on May 25, 1935, advocating for the resolution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute arising from the Wal Wal incident in accordance with the methods stipulated in Article 5 of the 1928 Italian-Ethiopian Treaty, has now learned that the arbitration committee established under the aforementioned resolution has ceased its work and that the governments concerned have requested the Council to provide a clear interpretation of the jurisdiction of the arbitration committee in order to promote the resumption of arbitration. However, this interpretation does not intend to judge the statements made by the representatives of both governments to the arbitration committee or the opinions expressed by the arbitrators. The Council believes that (1) the jurisdiction of the arbitration committee should be determined by agreement between the two parties to the dispute; (2) the committee should not review border issues or provide legal interpretations of agreements and treaties related to border issues, as this is not agreed upon by the two parties to the dispute, and therefore such actions should be outside the jurisdiction of the arbitration committee; (3) therefore, the arbitration committee's decision on the Wal Wal incident should not affect the resolution of issues outside the jurisdiction of the committee. Conversely, if the arbitration committee's decision on the Wal Wal incident is based on the opinion that the incident occurred under Italian or Ethiopian sovereignty, then such a decision would inevitably affect the resolution of issues outside the jurisdiction of the committee. Based on the above reasons, the Council hereby declares that the arbitration committee should not consider the issue of which country has jurisdiction over Wal Wal but should only consider other factors of the Wal Wal incident. As for the fact that the local authorities of the two parties to the dispute believe that Wal Wal belongs to which country, this fact can be considered by the arbitration committee, but it should not be disputed. In addition, the two parties to the dispute have decided to continue the arbitration process and declared that it is necessary to appoint a fifth neutral arbitrator to complete the work of the arbitration committee. For this reason, the four Italian-Ethiopian arbitrators will immediately meet to appoint a neutral arbitrator. The Council takes note of this. The Council hopes that this case will be resolved by September 1, 1935, and requests both governments to submit the results of the arbitration process to the Council no later than September 4, 1935.</p>
<p>Resolution 2:</p>
<p>The Council of the League of Nations has decided that, regardless of the circumstances, it shall convene a meeting on September 4, 1935, to conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of the Italian-Ethiopian relationship. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>The first resolution was passed by a unanimous vote with no abstentions. The second resolution was also passed unanimously, but the Italian representative abstained from voting.</p>
<p>The 1928 Italian-Ethiopian Treaty mentioned in the first resolution stipulates that all disputes between the two countries should be submitted to arbitration, with a limit of twenty years.</p>
<p>This meeting was one of the shortest in the history of the League of Nations, lasting only forty-five minutes. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, the chairman, proposed the resolution and asked the representatives to express their opinions. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Italian and Ethiopian Representatives Speak</p>
<p>Professor Jèze, the representative of the Ethiopian government, was the first to stand up and declare that, in order to maintain peace, Ethiopia was willing to make significant sacrifices to accept the Council's resolution, so that Ethiopia's sincere attitude towards the League of Nations could be clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, Ethiopia firmly believed that the arbitrators would eventually have a full understanding of Ethiopia's legitimate demands. He hereby declared to the world that Ethiopia was determined to accept any fair plan decided by the arbitration committee. In addition, Ethiopia hoped that the Council would convene a meeting on September 4 to discuss all outstanding issues between Italy and Ethiopia, so as to promote a permanent friendly relationship between the two countries. Subsequently, Italian representative Aloisi spoke, stating that Italy supported the Council's first resolution. As for the second resolution, which stipulated that the Council would conduct a comprehensive review of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute on September 4, he had decided to abstain from voting based on the declaration made by the Italian representative at the first meeting of the Council on July 31. (Havas)</p>
<p>Britain and France Eager for Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>After Aloisi finished speaking, Laval stood up and first stated the extreme difficulty of the negotiations. He then said that after the appointment of the fifth arbitrator, the Wal Wal incident would be finally resolved. This should satisfy those who still trust the League of Nations. Finally, speaking as the representative of France, he declared that he not only did not consider his work to be completed but was also willing to do his utmost to achieve a reconciliation and maintain peace.</p>
<p>At this point, Eden, representing Britain, stood up and asked all parties to accept these two resolutions. He said that after the Council passed these two resolutions, he would continue his efforts to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian issue by arbitration in accordance with the 1928 Italian-Ethiopian Treaty. Now that the two sides have no objection to appointing the fifth arbitrator, the reconciliation process will naturally succeed. At the same time, the Council must also quickly consider the final result. Eden continued, stating that if the Italian-Ethiopian issue remained tense after this arbitration, the countries that signed the 1906 treaty would immediately open negotiations to consider all issues related to the Italian-Ethiopian relationship. At that time, he would submit a negotiation report to the Council. Finally, Eden declared that the British government considered the Italian-Ethiopian issue to be very serious and, as a member state of the League of Nations, was extremely willing to do its utmost to resolve the Italian-Ethiopian conflict peacefully within the scope of the League of Nations' principles. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>In addition, the representatives of Denmark and Argentina fully supported the two resolutions. After the resolutions were passed, Chairman Litvinov thanked the representatives of Britain and France for their efforts in mediation and then announced the adjournment of the extraordinary meeting of the Council. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Britain, France, and Italy Issue Joint Communiqué</p>
<p>Before today's Council meeting, the representatives of France, Britain, and Italy issued a joint communiqué, stating that negotiations based on the 1906 tripartite agreement, aimed at facilitating the resolution of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, would be held in France as soon as possible. These negotiations would be technically separate from the League of Nations. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Possible Candidate for Fifth Arbitrator</p>
<p>It is now generally believed that the Greek Minister to Paris, Politis, will be elected as the fifth arbitrator. It is reported that Laval has proposed Politis's name, and Aloisi and Dr. Jèze have both expressed their agreement. The consent of the other four arbitrators has not yet been sought. (Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Eden's Broadcast Speech: Undaunted by Difficulties, No Delay, Negotiations Expected to Succeed; Laval Leaves Geneva and Returns Home <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(London) British cabinet minister Eden today issued a broadcast speech from Geneva regarding the League of Nations Council's efforts to mediate the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, stating: "We are facing a very serious matter, not just an occasional border incident. We are meeting in an atmosphere thick with the clouds of war. If war were to break out, there would be unforeseeable consequences. Unfortunately, we have not yet resolved all the disputes between Italy and Ethiopia. However, we have agreed that the three powers responsible for maintaining the political integrity and territorial integrity of Ethiopia under the treaty should conduct negotiations. We have also set a date by which the negotiations must succeed; otherwise, the League of Nations Council will have to fulfill its obligations under the League Covenant. There is absolutely no question of evading difficulties or acquiescing to delaying tactics. I have clearly stated that I will report on the progress of the matter to the next meeting of the League of Nations Council." (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Council has adjourned. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval left for Paris by car at 9:10 AM this morning. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">British Parliamentarians Express Dissatisfaction with Geneva Tripartite Agreement, Saying It Will Harm Eden's Reputation <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(London) Upon hearing the news that Britain, France, and Italy had reached an agreement in Geneva regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, members of the British Parliament expressed considerable dissatisfaction. Extreme right-wing parliamentarians believed that the prestige of Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden might be damaged as a result. The opposition Labour Party and the Liberal Party were also greatly disappointed that future negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy would not be held within the scope of the League of Nations. However, official sources pointed out that the tripartite agreement stipulated that the Council should reconvene on September 4 to conduct a comprehensive discussion of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. This was a preliminary measure to resolve the entire dispute in accordance with the League Covenant and could also be considered a victory for Eden. This is because Britain had never demanded a comprehensive discussion of the dispute while there was still hope for mediation in the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. Even if the Council wanted to conduct a comprehensive study, Italy would never send a representative to participate in the discussion. According to official sources, it is believed that Abyssinia will not be completely excluded from the future negotiations between Britain, France, and Italy. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Rome Reacts Indifferently to League of Nations Resolution; Core of the Problem Must Be Sought Outside the League of Nations; Skepticism Regarding Results of Future Tripartite Talks <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian public opinion has largely reacted indifferently to the resolution passed by the League of Nations Council, as it is generally believed that the core of the Italian-Ethiopian issue lies in Africa and not elsewhere. Although Italian officials are pleased that the Council's resolution adopts Italy's viewpoint, acknowledging that the jurisdiction of the arbitration committee should be limited to discussing the Wal Wal incident and should not involve border issues, they still believe that the core of the problem must be sought outside the League of Nations. Furthermore, Italian public opinion believes that the relationship between Italy and Ethiopia should be based on the 1928 Italian-Ethiopian Treaty, as the treaty was signed after both countries joined the League of Nations. Therefore, the Italian-Ethiopian dispute should be resolved based on the Italian-Ethiopian Treaty and not based on the League Covenant. Knowledgeable sources are also skeptical about whether the tripartite talks between Britain, France, and Italy based on the 1906 treaty regarding Abyssinia will yield any results. This is because the governments of Britain, France, and Italy had already engaged in diplomatic contacts on the Abyssinian issue but had never reached a conclusion. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Last night, a communiqué was released here denying the speeches made by Prime Minister Mussolini to the Blackshirts on July 6, which had been circulating in Fascist circles, calling them fictitious. It stated that the original edited version of the speech would be published in the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" today to dispel public doubts. At the same time, the announcement of the conscription of new recruits did not appear at the end of the week as expected, and there has been very little criticism of British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons last Thursday. All of this is noteworthy. It is believed that the reason for this is that the Italian government now feels that it has gained the upper hand in Geneva, so there is no need to make further provocative statements. It is reported that Mussolini's speech to the Blackshirts on July 6 included the following words: "You are invincible; you will soon see the five continents tremble before Fascist power and fight. You are about to set out to Abyssinia, the entire territory of which will belong to you. If the Abyssinians resist our formidable power, we will subject them to burning and looting. We will slap the face of the white defenders among the blacks to show retaliation." (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>(Paris) "L'Intransigeant" published a report from Geneva stating that the Italian war plan in Abyssinia is roughly as follows: The Italian army will be divided into ten columns, advancing on the Abyssinian capital from different directions. Five of these columns will assemble in Italian Somaliland, attacking Agadir in southern Abyssinia, and then advance along the five major rivers towards the capital, a distance of approximately 500 kilometers. This route is currently defended by General Nasibu with 20,000 troops. Another three Italian columns will depart from the port of Asseb in Italian Eritrea, occupying eastern Abyssinia, passing through the Danakil Desert and joining the five columns in the south, and then advancing towards the capital. This route is mountainous and the climate is consistently 115 degrees. Crown Prince Wosan is defending the area with 40,000 troops, relying on Mount Fukuro. If the two sides make contact, a major battle will occur in northern Abyssinia. Yet another Italian column is planning to pass through the Walgaide Plain, traveling several hundred kilometers to reach Gondar, where they will encounter 70,000 Abyssinian troops. Finally, there will be another column departing from Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, which is 2,500 meters above sea level, following the old route used by Italy to attack Abyssinia in 1895. The Italian army has high hopes for this route. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Tonight, well-informed circles in Italy expressed the opinion that the Abyssinian affair could not be satisfactorily resolved without military action. It is now necessary to make Abyssinia aware of Italy's military strength; otherwise, today's dispute will reappear in the future. At the same time, the announcement of the conscription of the remaining troops from the 1912 class and two more divisions, totaling 160,000 men, will probably be delayed until after the end of the week.

<p>(London) Moore, a prominent British historian and chairman of the National Liberal Federation, spoke in London today on the Pacific problem, stating: "The weakness and poverty of China have an unparalleled significance for the world. The situation in the Far East progressed steadily until 1929. After 1929, China's finances were in disarray, and the situation deteriorated further and further until the rulers of Japan abandoned their policy of participating in the collective system. The League of Nations and the countries of the world could neither force Japan to abide by its accepted obligations nor protect China to allow it to develop gradually. Today, the unfortunate Chinese cannot help but lose their faith in Western justice and will. Although the Chinese people hate their eastern neighbor, the blood relationship between China and Japan is closer than that with the West, which is still felt by the Chinese people. From now on, the situation in the Far East will not exceed two paths. One is that the Chinese people will follow the path of Western progress, engage in construction, and become self-reliant. The other is that they will join hands with Japan and tell the world, 'Given the current situation, we have no choice but to join the Japanese side to create a strong Eastern power to dominate the world.' If China takes this last step, the rest of the world will not be able to sleep soundly. Although I personally hope that China will still take its own path, whether this hope can be realized is indeed a major question for the future world." (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The highly anticipated Moscow-San Francisco flight via the North Pole commenced yesterday, but encountered its first setback when the crew discovered a lubricating oil leak, causing excessive oil consumption. Unable to ascertain or rectify this unexpected problem, they immediately telegraphed the Northern Sea Route Administration, requesting permission to return to an airfield in the Leningrad region. Upon receiving approval, the aircraft turned back from the southern Barents Sea, heading towards the Kola Peninsula, the White Sea, and Petrozavodsk, returning to Leningrad. Twenty-two and a half hours after departing Moscow, the Northern Sea Route Administration received a second report stating that the aircraft had safely landed at an airfield south of Leningrad. A new committee has been formed to investigate the various causes of the lubricating oil malfunction during the flight. (4th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The ambitious attempt by Soviet aviator Levanevsky to fly from Russia to San Francisco via the North Pole has failed, at least temporarily. However, determined to showcase the skills of Soviet aircraft and personnel to the world, Soviet authorities will not completely abandon this endeavor. Nevertheless, this setback has caused great disappointment throughout Russia. This morning at 4:00 AM (British Summer Time), Mr. Levanevsky took off with two assistants. According to a radio report sent at 1:20 PM the same day, they had flown over the White Sea and Vony, on the northern coast of the Barents Sea. However, after Mr. Levanevsky departed from the Kola Peninsula, he reported that the gasoline injector was malfunctioning, resulting in significant fuel consumption. Although the aircraft was safely flying over the Arctic Ocean, Mr. Levanevsky telegraphed a request to return to Russia. Upon receiving approval, he immediately turned back and safely arrived at the airfield south of Leningrad at 10:30 PM tonight. Mr. Levanevsky decided to abandon his 6,000-mile flight after traveling 1,000 miles of the planned route, which was to pass through the North Pole, Alaska, Fort Simpson in Canada, Vancouver, and then along the coast to California. The aircraft he was piloting was a specially designed monoplane with retractable landing gear and a 500-horsepower engine, manufactured in the Soviet Union. This morning's flight averaged over 80 miles per hour. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union is paying extraordinary attention to and takes great pride in the flight between Moscow and San Francisco undertaken by Soviet hero Levanevsky and his valiant comrades. Today, all newspapers carried this news, along with photographs and texts from Mr. Levanevsky himself, as well as Batoukov, Levchenko, the aircraft designer, a renowned journalist, a professor, and Arctic Ocean aviators. They all stated that the journey was extremely difficult, but the aircraft and personnel used were excellent and the preparations were thorough. Before departure, Mr. Levanevsky, Levchenko, and Batoukov telegraphed the entire nation, saying, "We embark with a heart full of the victory of our nation. Our perfect aircraft embodies the strength of our country. The Soviet people form a happy family, and we are fortunate to be members of this family." They also thanked Stalin for his kindness and concern, and Defense Commissar Voroshilov and Heavy Industries Commissar Ordzhonikidze for their invaluable assistance. They concluded by saying that they wished to quickly return to their homeland and joyfully reunite with their comrades. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

At the same time, Ambassador Saito in the United States was urgently instructed to call the attention of the United States State Department authorities and request that he lodge a serious protest with the person in charge of publishing the magazine.

<p>(Washington) Kiyojiro Yoshizawa, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., visited the State Department on the morning of the 3rd to call the authorities' attention to the "Vanity Fair" magazine's disrespectful treatment of the Japanese Imperial Family.

<p>The picture in question was not drawn with malicious intent, and can only be described as a naive and harmless sketch. Needless to say, there was no intention to insult.

Now that a statement has been issued, all anxieties have been swept away.

<p>(Tokyo) The total amount of new requests from various ministries for the coming year is approximately 1.08 billion yen. It seems that the various ministries' cooperation, which the Ministry of Finance has been strongly advocating, has had some effect. The new requests from each ministry are listed below (unit: million yen):</p>
<p>Navy Ministry: 310; Army Ministry: 235</p>
<p>Ministry of Internal Affairs: 150; Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry: 66</p>

<p>Ministry of Colonial Affairs: 12; Ministry of Communications: 30</p>
<p>Ministry of Commerce and Industry: 12</p>
<p>As can be seen from the above, most of the proposed budget for the coming year is for national defense. The difficulty in compiling the budget lies in the military budget. How the Ministry of Finance will investigate and determine this is a matter of great concern to Finance Minister Takahashi and the Finance Ministry authorities. Furthermore, there is concern that each ministry will compete for budget allocations in the future, so there is a sense of apprehension about the prospects for compiling the budget.

<p>(Nanjing) Shao Yuanchong completed his inspection of the Northwest, and returned south via the Pinghan Railway from Datong and Taiyuan. He returned to Nanjing by Eurasia plane at 2:00 PM on the 4th, arriving at 6:00 PM. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries about the inspection process, the trip lasted more than four months, covering more than 10,000 li, passing through the provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, as far west as Dunhuang. He conducted detailed inspections of the economic construction and people's livelihood in various places, and the results were very clear. The Northwest is rich in resources, no less than the Jiangnan region. Unfortunately, due to backward transportation and culture, there is no way to develop it. Fortunately, local officials in recent years have been working hard to develop it, so prosperity is by no means difficult. However, the country is poor, and the central government should plan a whole concrete method so that priorities can be arranged in order. The most important thing is transportation and water conservancy, which cannot be delayed. The Northwest produces very rich products, and the land is not all barren and bitter. If construction is good and transportation is convenient, there is no need to worry about prosperity. However, the current poverty of the people is beyond our imagination. Taking schools as an example, the hardship has reached the extreme, but the spirit is no less than that of schools in Jiangnan. The inspection results are very detailed, and may be written out for the study of the people of the country, or suggestions may be made to the central government for reference. After returning to Nanjing today, he will take a rest and will not go elsewhere. (4th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Jinan Communication: The floodwaters from the Yellow River breach converged in Jining. The waters of the lakes and rivers all surged fiercely. As the southward discharge was obstructed, the west bank of Jining Nanyang Lake, the east bank of the Grand Canal, and the north bank of Zhao Wang River all collapsed. The water flowed northward from Jining along the Grand Canal. Wenshang, Dongping, and other counties again reported emergencies. There are many rivers in these counties, all of which converge into the Grand Canal. The Grand Canal, with its high water level, could not discharge the water. Wenshang's Wen River and Dongping's Xiaoqing River breached. Dong'a and Dongping both have a large lake (Dongping Lake). The Yellow River water from the Grand Canal flowed into the lake, but the lake could not contain it. It flooded southwards. The northeast of the Dongping Canal also completely overflowed. Thus, Dongping was surrounded by water on three sides. Not only was the entire county in danger of being submerged, but Dongping and Wenshang were also about to be completely engulfed in the disaster area. Today (the 2nd), according to a telephone message from Dongping, the Yellow River water from Dongping Lake reached the San Guan Temple south of the city, the closest point to the city. A protective embankment was built around the city (a little distance from the city), and water had already started seeping in. County Magistrate Sun Yonghan is currently supervising the construction of embankments at Jinjiakou, southwest of the city, to block the Yellow River water. All government agencies in the city have completely stopped working to assist in the emergency efforts to protect the embankment outside the city. People are in a state of panic. The water from Dongping Lake on the north side reached Wang Gudizhen in Ershilibao, the boundary between Dongping and Donghe, and also flowed southwards. The Xiaoqing River south of the city breached for about a thousand zhang due to the Grand Canal's backflow. It flooded Wenshang to the south. Wenshang, Dongping, and Dong'a have been completely engulfed in the disaster area.</p>
<p>Dongping Communication: The water from the Yellow River breach in Juancheng, western Shandong, flowed northeast towards Dongping with unstoppable force. The west, north, and south sides of Dongping city are now a vast expanse of water. Many villages have been submerged, with only the rooftops visible. Over 7,000 qing of farmland and over 600 villages have been flooded. Over 300,000 people have been affected. The loss of houses and crops is over 30 million. The exact number of deaths of humans and livestock is still unknown. The immense scale of the flood is unprecedented. The county's party and government officials and people from all walks of life are rescuing people, retrieving livestock, providing porridge, and distributing food. However, as the Yellow River water rises daily, the disaster area expands further. The county has exhausted its financial and physical resources and desperately hopes for relief and assistance from all sides.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Gucheng Suffers Another Flood Disaster, Thousands Drown in Cities and Villages. Landslide Causes Collapse of City Walls and Buildings. Impossible to Distinguish Land From Water. Dragon Eggs with Embryonic Form Found and Sent to Hankou for Display. <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: Gucheng, located upstream on the Yao River, faces Laokou, Guanghua, across the river. At the beginning of last month, the river rose violently, causing an unprecedented disaster. The county was also submerged in a large flood. Although the water receded relatively quickly, the current was too swift, and the losses suffered were no less than those in Xiangfan, Tianmen, and Hanchuan. Before long, another disaster struck. On the 1st of this month, the water level of the South River in the county rose again, with the water head over ten zhang high. The land on both banks that had been receding was submerged again. The replanted autumn crops were completely buried in sand. Countless surviving homes collapsed. On the 2nd, the water rose further, directly threatening the city walls. County Magistrate Chen and the 82nd Division of the stationed army had blocked the city gates and hired many boats to prepare for rescue. The seriousness of the situation can be imagined. Cheng Zerun, the Administrative Inspector of the Eighth District and County Magistrate of Xiangyang, reported to Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun via telegram on the 3rd based on a telegram from the Gucheng County government.</p>
<p>The first major disaster in the county could not be learned due to the flooding of the highways, the destruction of the telegraph lines, and the interruption of transportation. According to a detailed investigation, every time it rained in the county, which is at the intersection of mountains and rivers, the ditches and valleys were filled, and low-lying areas were submerged. However, the water would recede when it cleared up. On July 3rd, there was a heavy downpour that lasted all day and night. Residents regarded it as a normal occurrence and did not prepare. The heavy rain continued non-stop. On the evening of the 5th, the North and South Rivers suddenly rose, and the Xiang River broke its banks, flooding the entire county and reaching the city walls. On the evening of the 6th, the water rose another ten zhang. A landslide on the South River caused the collapse of dozens of zhang of city walls on the east, west, and south sides of the county seat. The city became a vast expanse of water. The residents suddenly encountered a major disaster and had no way to escape. Most of the old, weak, women, and children were swept away by the flood. The strong either climbed onto the rooftops or squeezed into the treetops to wait for dawn. The soil in the area is very loose, and the houses are not very sturdy, collapsing as soon as they were exposed to water. The sound of collapsing houses continued all night. Those who took refuge on the roofs could not escape being drowned or buried under the collapsed houses. At that time, the county government building was submerged, and the county magistrate and staff were trapped in the water. There were no boats to be found inside or outside the city. Rong Jingfang, commander of the 82nd Division, immediately sent a company of soldiers, braving the danger, to hire dozens of civilian boats and set off into the Xiang River to rescue the flood victims outside the city. Rong personally supervised the rescue of flood victims outside the city, and sent boats to the Shaanxi Guild Hall, rescued all the staff of the Special Party Department of the division, and worked together to help the refugees. Over two days, they rescued 5,000 flood victims and set up shelters. On the evening of the 8th, people from all walks of life organized a flood relief committee and elected Shen Liang, standing committee member of the Special Party Department of the 82nd Division, as the chairman of the committee. Five groups were set up: general affairs, medical rescue, food distribution, investigation, and discipline. Work began that night. On the morning of the 9th, boats were sent to the surrounding villages to rescue and shelter a total of 20,000 people. The military provided funds to set up factories and distribute porridge. It is said that the funds were entirely donated by Commander Rong. Because of the distance from the province and the disruption of communications, there was no time to ask for relief. The local area was devastated and had no money to raise. On the 9th, the water stabilized, and after the 10th, it gradually receded. A post-disaster investigation revealed that the greatest losses occurred in the urban area and the first, second, and third districts, followed by the fifth district, and then the fourth and sixth districts. Because the water came too violently, many people died. In addition to those swept away by the water, over 10,000 floating corpses were found within the area. Over 20,000 livestock died. The Special Party Department of the 82nd Division, the military hospital, the political training office, and the security team organized a burial team to retrieve and bury over 3,000 human corpses. The stench was overwhelming due to the scorching sun, and all those who participated in the work became ill. The exact number of houses that collapsed is still unknown. The towns and villages in the first, second, and third districts have been razed to the ground. It is impossible to distinguish land from water. The area outside the south gate of the county seat is the commercial center, and was the most deeply flooded. No goods were saved. The magnitude of the loss is unprecedented. During the flood, a myth spread among the people that groups of dragons were swimming in the North and South Rivers, with waves rising and falling together, witnessed by many people. However, the fact that the army found two dragon eggs in a collapsed city wall base in front of the nursery garden in the South City when digging holes to drain the water is indeed a fact. One was damaged by the excavator shaking it, but the other was intact. Upon dissection, it had already taken embryonic form, with the head and mouth resembling a dragon. Shen Liang, standing committee member of the Special Party Department of the 82nd Division, placed it in an alcohol bottle and sent it to Hankou for display. A mountain on the South River completely collapsed. The power of the water was insufficient to cause this, so it was likely caused by dragons. (The 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Guangdong Province Celebrates "August 1st" Commemoration with Resolution of Government and People to Abolish Exorbitant Taxes and Fees <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The "August 1st" Commemoration is a unique commemoration in Guangdong Province, and it is also the first commemorative day of this year. The so-called "August 1st" Commemoration is the anniversary of the abolition of exorbitant taxes and fees. Although the province has suffered in recent years due to the decline of the silk industry, the reduction of remittances from overseas Chinese, and the bankruptcy of the rural economy, since the promulgation of the Three-Year Governance Plan, the authorities have been vigorously carrying out industrial construction in order to increase production. At the same time, they have actively reorganized finances and resolutely abolished exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes to ease the burden on the people and gradually restore the rural economy. It is estimated that since the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the province has abolished 21 types of cargo taxes in Nanxiong Meiguan, etc., with an annual revenue of 113,950 yuan; 13 types of miscellaneous taxes in Lechang, etc., with an annual revenue of over 148,000 yuan; one type of brown sugar tax, with an annual revenue of 860,000 yuan; 19 types of Guangzhou West Tax Factory, etc., with an annual revenue of 1,958,000 yuan; banned gambling in 27 counties such as Shunde, with an annual revenue of 1,664,460 yuan; and abolished 42 types of Taipao and Zuo Li taxes, with an annual revenue of over 1,681,200 yuan; and 25 types of business licenses and booth fees of the Foshan Supplementary Lilac Gold Bureau, with an annual revenue of over 68,260 yuan, totaling over 6 million yuan in annual revenue from exorbitant taxes and gambling that have been abolished. The amount cannot be considered small. These exorbitant taxes and gambling were abolished on August 1st of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and some were scheduled to be abolished on August 1st of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, the Provincial Council specially proposed to designate August 1st as the Guangdong Abolition of Exorbitant Taxes and Gambling Commemoration Day, both to commemorate the government's resolution to make a fresh start with the people and to celebrate the people's relief from the suffering of exorbitant taxes and gambling. From now on, the people will work together, burying their heads in hard work and striving to build production. This also shows the beginning of Guangdong's new future. The Provincial Council and the Provincial Party Department have jointly organized various groups to prepare for the "August 1st" Commemoration, which is indeed very meaningful.</p>

<p>Ningbo Communication: Since July 30th, a number of Qian Zhuang (traditional Chinese banks) in Ningbo, including Yiyuan, Xinyuan, Yongyuan, Wuyuan, Taiyuan, Taisheng, Hengmao, Weikang, Xingyuan, and Yikang, have successively closed down. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 2nd), five major same-trade organizations, including Taihan, Huiyuan, Yufeng, Jingyuan, and Yuyuan, and eight minor organizations, including Baoyuan, Taixun, Baohe, Yuancheng, Chengyuan, Fengda, and Tongtai, were also affected by the withdrawal of deposits and suspended operations. The Yin County government not only issued a notice restricting depositors to withdrawing only 100 yuan in cash per day, but also ordered the Chamber of Commerce to work with the silver and money industries to quickly develop measures to address the situation. The Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting at 4 PM yesterday (the 2nd), attended by over 50 leaders of the financial community, including Yu Zuochen, Ruan Jiaxian, Jin Keqiang, Hong Chensheng, Lu Ruikang, Chen Xiangyu, Zhang Puful, Zhang Xingzhi, Zhu Xuchang, and Yu Runquan. Zhao Cicsheng, the Administrative Inspector of the Fifth District, Chen Baolin, the County Magistrate of Yin County, and Ni Weixiong, the Chief of Construction Section, were also present. The meeting was chaired by Yu Zuochen, and six resolutions were made on the spot to provide relief: (1) No single Qian Zhuang's shortfall should exceed 150,000 yuan. If the shortfall exceeds 150,000 yuan on a given day, the excess amount will be split up by the same-trade organizations and jointly responsible. (2) From today, the amount of deposits that can be withdrawn per household per day shall not exceed 100 yuan. The Yin County government has issued a notice explicitly restricting this, and all Qian Zhuang shall abide by it. (3) If the Qian Zhuang Association Committee believes that a particular Qian Zhuang has too many shortfalls, it may investigate the number of split shortfalls at any time, and if necessary, order it to fill the shortfalls. (4) It is hoped that the local banks will temporarily not accept transfers of deposits. (5) Request the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to jointly lend 2 million yuan in national currency to provide relief. (6) All closed Qian Zhuang shall resume operations immediately, and payment clearing will be handled as before, and a copy of the receipts and payments shall be sent to the Chamber of Commerce for review and forwarded to the county government for verification. At the same time, all shareholders will do their best to increase capital, and all depositors will temporarily refrain from withdrawing deposits. After the discussion, Commissioner Zhao and Magistrate Chen gave instructions, and the Chamber of Commerce issued a statement to reassure depositors. The abnormal tension and panic in Ningbo's financial circles in recent days are expected to gradually calm down. As for the large and small Qian Zhuang that announced their liquidation yesterday (the 2nd), the details are as follows: (1) Taihan Qian Zhuang, manager Lin Mengfei, is the current chairman of the Qian Zhuang Association, with a capital of 50,000 yuan and an annual total receipt and payment of approximately 100,000-200,000 yuan.

In addition, Tongtai Exchange Shop was established solely by Shi Yunsheng, who served as manager, with a capital of 6,000 yuan. It had been open for over 20 years. Due to the tight credit of both large and small same-trade organizations and the rush to withdraw deposits, it was forced to close down. It is reported that the shop had deposits of approximately 40,000 yuan and loans of approximately 100,000 yuan. After offsetting the receipts and payments, there was still a surplus of 20,000 yuan. It is said that after the crisis subsides, they plan to regroup and continue operations. (The 3rd)</p>

<p>Jiading: Enclosing Ye Pond to Commemorate Martyrs</p>
<p>When the Manchus entered China, the martyrs Hou Tongzeng and Huang Chunyao resisted the foreign race and bravely defended the city. They were eventually outnumbered, and on the day the city fell, Hou drowned himself in Ye Pond to die for his country. His loyalty and righteousness shine brightly in the annals of history. The pond is now located next to the west side of the Education Bureau. Due to its age, it has fallen into private hands, and most of it has been filled in. In order to preserve historical sites, the county government proposed and decided at the political affairs meeting on the 3rd of this month to take the pond under public management and embellish it to promote the martyrs and encourage people.</p>

<p>The South Bridge Sock Factory in South Bridge Town was founded by Xu Xianchang and has over 100 sock machines and over 100 female workers. The original wages were 18 cents per dozen for #132 socks, 20 cents per dozen for #188 socks, and 21 cents per dozen for #200 socks. Recently, in order to increase work efficiency and production, the factory revised the wages, providing that for #132 socks, the wage would be 15 cents per dozen for more than 30 dozen per month, 16 cents per dozen for more than 40 dozen, and 17 cents per dozen for more than 50 dozen. As each female worker, in accordance with past practice, makes at most 40 dozen per month, this new regulation is called a wage increase in name, but in reality is a wage reduction. The female workers expressed dissatisfaction and repeatedly negotiated, but to no avail, and went on strike yesterday. The situation is currently being mediated.</p>

<p>Nantong: Relieving the Decline of the Native Cloth Industry</p>
<p>The native cloth industry in Nantong has recently suffered a severe decline in sales. Farmers with weaving machines in the countryside have completely stopped working. Local people believe that as the county is a cotton-producing area and native cloth is the only sideline for farmers in the entire county, the impact is extremely large. Experts are discussing remedies. The native cloth market will open next month. Measures will be taken to eliminate substandard cloth. Li Shengbo and the textile technicians of the Cotton Control Association are designing improved weaving machines and are rushing to build a dyeing factory.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the examination of the provisions in Article 14 of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations, which state, "The Department of Finance may, at any time, dispatch personnel to conduct on-site spot checks based on the survey reports of various bureaus," this department dispatched personnel to Wujiang for a spot check. This was done in accordance with the established regulations to verify whether the reported figures were accurate and whether there were any instances of underreporting or omissions. The account books of the Cheng Fuxing Rice Firm in Shengze were the first to be examined. Handling the matter in accordance with regulations and requesting to view the account books was a normal procedure and not a significant issue. However, Cheng Fuxing relied on the guild as a shield and refused the request. The department commissioner and the bureau, finding that the firm was not complying with the regulations and was deliberately resisting, immediately suspended the work and reported the matter to the department, requesting that the Wujiang County Government be instructed to have the Public Security Bureau obtain the accounts. As the county magistrate also served as the Commissioner of Supervision and Collection, he had the authority, according to regulations, to enforce compliance when merchants refused to cooperate with investigations. However, the Shengze Rice Guild sent a telegram to the province, threatening a complete work stoppage by its members. Before the provincial department could respond, they carried out a forced market strike. Simultaneously, Cheng Fuxing and others led a mob to the Business Tax Bureau, destroying everything. Six officials were seriously injured, with two in critical condition. Documents, vouchers, and all other items were completely destroyed. After achieving their goal of destroying the bureau, the rioters, upon hearing a flute call, led the crowd away. At the same time, the rice firms voluntarily resumed normal business operations. Such organized and planned mob violence disturbing public order is intolerable under the law. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly ordered that guilds not control business taxes. Yet, the rice guild dared to arbitrarily exert such control, sending telegrams with threats. Despite regulations requiring account checks, Cheng Fuxing dared to resist and disobey. They used a market strike to protest and the destruction of the bureau to demonstrate. If they are not severely punished according to the law, how can order be maintained? In addition to requesting the provincial government to arrest the principal offenders and severely punish them, this letter is specially sent to your esteemed newspaper with the request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth and prevent misunderstandings. Sincerely, Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, August 3rd.</p>

It departed from Hong Kong at 8:15 AM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM. The Central News Agency reporter provides the following details:</p>
<p>Welcoming Delegation</p>
<p>The Italian Consulate in Shanghai received a telegram yesterday morning stating that the aircraft had departed from Hong Kong at 8:15 AM. They immediately notified all relevant parties.

<p>Arrived in Shanghai at 4 PM</p>
<p>According to the original schedule, the aircraft was expected to arrive at 1:00 PM. However, due to inclement weather, the flight was delayed. It finally appeared south of Hongqiao Airport at 3:30 PM. Two aircraft from the airport, piloted by Gao Zhihang and others, performed aerial acrobatics. As the Savoia-Marchetti approached, they guided it in a circle around the city before landing precisely at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Flight Crew</p>
<p>There were six people on board, including Colonel Scaroin, the pilot; First Pilot Tondi; Second Pilot Chiapparo; Sulussoliu; Bisol; and Peseotori. Upon disembarking, the military attaché dispatched by the Italian Consulate to Hong Kong introduced Colonel Scaroin to each of the welcoming guests.</p>
<p>Welcome Speeches</p>
<p>The Chinese and Italian flags were displayed high atop the airport office. Welcoming staff led Scaroin to the front of the office, where Hongqiao Station Master Qin Zongfan offered champagne and gave a brief welcoming speech. Both sides cheered "Long Live China and Italy!" They then went inside for refreshments and a brief exchange of greetings before heading to the Italian Consulate. Afterward, they went to the Cathay Hotel for rest.</p>
<p>Scaroin's Remarks</p>
<p>The aircraft departed from Rome on July 6th and made stops at various locations along the way. According to Colonel Scaroin, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, he left Hong Kong at 8:15 AM this morning (yesterday morning). Due to unfavorable weather along the way, his arrival in Shanghai was slightly delayed. He was feeling fatigued upon landing. He had not yet decided how long he would stay in Shanghai or when he would fly to Chengdu. (Scaroin is a world-renowned aviator who shot down 29 enemy aircraft during the European War.)</p>
<p>Will Soon Fly to Sichuan</p>
<p>The aircraft is a single-wing Savoia-Marchetti, painted cream-colored, with the letters ABMO. It has three engines, each with 650 horsepower, totaling 1,954 horsepower. The wingspan is 100 feet, and the fuselage is 60 feet long. It is quite large and imposing and can accommodate ten to twenty passengers. It is reported that the aircraft will undergo inspection and repair in Shanghai before flying to Sichuan. Municipal authorities in Shanghai will host a banquet in the next few days to welcome the crew.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency report states that the "Qinghai" aircraft, piloted by Japanese pilot Mr. Ano, departed from London, passed through China, and flew back to Japan. After arriving in Hong Kong, the aircraft took off from Hong Kong to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the aircraft parts were damaged on the way, and it was forced to land in Fuzhou. It then took off from Fuzhou to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and arrived here at about 5:00 PM that day, landing at Longhua Airport. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan in two or three days. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>Those who went to Longhua Airport yesterday to welcome the crew included: Wang Changchun, representing Mayor Wu; Tan Baoshou, Chief Inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau; Liang Fuchu, Chief of the Xinzha Public Security Branch; Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China Honno; Naval Attaché Sato; Secretaries Tanaka and Iwai Izumi; Commander of the Special Naval Landing Force Araki; Commander of the Third Fleet Hyakutake; Miss Mieko, daughter of Consul General Ishii; Sugimoto, Chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association of Shanghai; Hayashi, Chairman of the All-Shanghai Japanese Associations; Tanabe, Secretary-General of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Tanno, representative of the Japanese Association; Sato, representative of the Japanese High School; Konishi Tomiko, Okuda Kazuko, Ido Natsuko, Eguchi Mutsumi, and Tanabe Ayako, representatives of the Japanese Higher Girls' School; and representatives of the Nagasaki Prefecture Association, totaling more than 50 people.

<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Qinghai aircraft took off from Fuzhou at 12:30 PM yesterday afternoon to Shanghai, but Shanghai never received confirmation that the aircraft had left Fujian. Welcoming guests all arrived at Longhua Airport in the morning to wait. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, they looked up at the sky, but still did not see the shadow of the Qinghai aircraft. It was not until about 4:50 PM that the aircraft was seen coming from the south and circling the field once before landing at Longhua Airport at exactly 5:00 PM. Amidst the applause of Chinese and Japanese people, pilot Ano disembarked, received flowers presented by various Japanese organizations and the flag presented by the Nagasaki Prefecture Association, and then walked into the passenger lounge. Sugimoto, chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association of Shanghai, stood up and delivered a welcoming speech, and then everyone raised their glasses to drink "Hakutsuru" and dispersed. Pilot Ano is a young man in his twenties, full of energy and heroic. He stayed at the Tatsumi-kan Hotel on Youheng Road last night.</p>
<p>Ano's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Pilot Ano, he took off from Fuzhou at 12:30 PM this afternoon (yesterday afternoon). Due to the bad weather, after taking off, he always drove in the clouds, struggled hard for more than four hours before breaking out of the clouds. At that time, he found that the gasoline remaining in the aircraft was only enough to support it for 15 minutes. Fortunately, when he looked down, Shanghai was in sight, so he was able to land safely. He originally planned to return to his country via Qingdao, Dalian, and Korea, but now he has decided to stay in Shanghai for two or three days before returning directly to Japan's Oita Air Base.</p>

Unexpectedly, when it flew near Hanzhong, it was again covered by clouds and fog, making it difficult to discern the direction. Moreover, the mountain peaks in that area were rugged, making navigation difficult. It was even more difficult to find another route, so it temporarily turned east to fly to Hankou. It left Hankou at 7:22 AM on the 4th, flew along the route of the China National Aviation Corporation, and arrived in Chengdu at noon. It is now planned to rush the completion of the construction of the Chengdu-Hanzhong airport station radio station so that it can report the weather to the air at any time.

The next day, it encountered a hurricane on the South China Sea, but fortunately, it was well-prepared, so it was not in danger. However, the ship's radio machine was blown up by the wind, so the ship could not report its itinerary. The company was deeply worried. It was not until 6:00 AM yesterday morning that the Huaping telegram was received, saying that it had safely arrived in Fujian Province. The telegram was sent to the Shanghai office after reaching Fujian. The company was greatly relieved.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Ningbo Compatriot Association, Concerned About Hometown Finance, Will Hold a Meeting to Study Revival Methods, Important Suggestions by Zhang Daoyuan of Ningbo <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since Datong Heng, Xinyuan, Yiyuan, Taiyuan, Yongyuan, Wuyuan, and other money houses in Ningbo were agitated by the social and economic turmoil and suspended operations, people were panicked and rushed to withdraw deposits. In a few days, more than 20 companies, including Taisheng, Yuyuan, Jingyuan, Huiyuan, Taihan, Yufeng, Yuanheng, and Yuanchun, either suspended operations or were liquidated. This was indeed an unprecedented financial crisis in Ningbo. The impact has affected various ports such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Hankou. Although the Yin County government has restricted the number of withdrawals, and the Ningbo Money House Guild has resolved that all will suspend collection and settlement, they are all stopgap measures. Now it is heard that the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association believes that the financial crisis was caused by the money houses themselves, but the depositors did not understand the situation clearly and followed the trend, rushing to withdraw deposits, which seemed to be the main cause of the crisis. Yesterday, a meeting was held to discuss rescue measures, and a special committee will be organized to handle this matter. At the same time, the association also received suggestions from compatriot Zhang Daoyuan, which will also be discussed. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Zhang's letter: In order to contribute opinions, I would like to ask your association to immediately organize the Ningbo Economic Recovery Committee to promote the Ningbo Economic Group in order to save the country. I believe that Ningbo's economy and culture have benefited my country and the international community in a grand and long-lasting way. In the past, Daoyuan drafted an article "The Status of Ningbo City in the History of International Commerce," which was roughly explained. Based on the textual research of his humble work, it can be seen that the modern mercantilism, our Ningbo people, can be called the ancestors. Therefore, they have always had a superior position in the domestic and foreign markets. However, recently, a financial crisis occurred in Shanghai, and the shock and collapse of our Ningbo help turned to suffer again, panting and struggling. The bad news from our hometown is frequent, and the finance is like a mountain and a sea. The root of our Yong economy has been eroded, and our industry and commerce are also like morning dew. Looking around, there are dangers everywhere, and the livelihood of the whole family is almost extinct. Some say that this is due to the attack of the recessionary turmoil, and the shared momentum is irresistible. However, looking back at those who are evenly matched with our Ningbo gang, their financial strength, according to statistics, has made greater progress than last year. Therefore, the industry and commerce supported by their strength can all struggle to prosper. When we examine why they are uniquely good, it is all due to their tangible and intangible group spirit. In the international arena, this kind of economic group, such as the British group and the American group, has done everything possible to restore its prosperity. Now, our Ningbo, with a shared boat and a historical destiny and the legacy of excellent species, has declared the bankruptcy of the domestic economy. Is it not ashamed to die? If we are not brave enough to know our shame and reverse the tide, then in the future, we will have nothing to rely on to survive, and we will only perish together. Daoyuan has attempted to promote the honor of our Ningbo history and has published his rough plans in the newspapers, and what he said is often just a confession. Now, I do not hesitate to take the liberty of submitting my humble opinions to your association, hoping that you will quickly organize the Ningbo Economic Recovery Committee to urgently rescue the economic life of our Ningbo from the brink of extinction for the vanguard of our national revival. I can't help but pray for it.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a letter from Lin Jinwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the Disaster Relief and Revitalization Association of Zhide County, Anhui Province, stating that Zhide is located near the Yangtze River, and is known as a rocky city, with many mountains and few fields, a narrow land and a dense population. In years of abundance, the income is not enough to eat. If there is a partial disaster, panic will be seen immediately. Since the spring of last year, bandits and droughts have been combined. There is no surplus of grain in the family, and there are few hidden possessions in the household. Crying for hunger and cold, and wailing are everywhere. There are countless people who have hanged themselves, fallen into wells, and been poisoned to death. In total, more than 10,000 people have died in more than a year. The remaining people who are struggling and suffering are in this catastrophe. The lives of 120,000 people in our county have no chance of survival. Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been continuous rains and disasters, and floods have broken out. The Yangtze River has flowed back, and if the Li Gongwei dam is mentioned, it is the screen barrier attached to the city. Now it has collapsed, and a vast ocean is the result. Residents near the dam, government buildings, and houses are gone. Corpses are floating around. The paddy rice has been washed away. Innumerable livestock have been drowned. The lucky survivors have become refugees. Due to the water vapor and sun exposure, epidemics are prevalent. Disasters are coming one after another. The extreme misery cannot be described. Please urgently allocate huge funds to rescue the survivors so that the people of Zhide will not be filled with ditches. The previous reports have recorded that floods in Anqing, Anhui Province, have broken through dams, houses have been submerged, and people have died tragically. The disaster in Zhide is even more so. The counties along the Yangtze River are even more miserable. The society hopes that the source of revitalization funds is reliable and can be used to save the disaster victims and fulfill their natural duties.</p>

<p>According to Dagong News Agency, since receiving the order from the Ministry of Communications, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is planning a national transportation network. In addition to the implementation of water-land transportation on the Longhai and Jiaoji Railways, and the four railways in Jiangnan, and actively preparing for the implementation of the BeiNing Railway, the company is continuing to organize lines such as the Jinpu, Daoqing, Nanxun, and Yuehan Railways, and connecting them with the completed highways and passenger ticket intermodal transport. The national joint transportation network plan is scheduled to be fully completed by the end of this year. The progress of those currently being organized is deeply recorded as follows:</p>
<p>BeiNing Intermodal Transport Scheduled for Implementation</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the BeiNing Railway Bureau are organizing water-land cargo intermodal transport. The BeiNing Railway has submitted the draft contract and freight regulations signed by both parties to the Ministry of Railways for approval, and then forwarded them to Shanghai. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has signed the contract by General Manager Liu Hongsheng, and after retaining a copy, the rest were sent back to the Railway Bureau. It has been decided to implement intermodal transport from the 15th of this month. Tanggu will be the general station for water-land intermodal cargo. The various procedures will be completed in the coming days.</p>
<p>Two-Line Contract Approved by the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>The intermodal transport contract and detailed rules for the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways were drafted by the Joint Transport Division of the Business Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in consultation with the Transportation Department of the two railway bureaus. The Railway Bureau immediately reported it to the Ministry of Railways for approval. It was originally intended to implement intermodal transport as soon as possible, but the review procedures by the Ministry of Railways were slightly delayed, resulting in the delay until now. March is approaching. It is now known that the intermodal transport contract has been approved, and the two bureaus will soon handle the formal signing. The earliest implementation date will be in early September.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Butchers Petition the Party Department to Thoroughly Investigate Secretly Added Transportation Fees, Expressing Dissatisfaction with the Slaughter Companies <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Over 1,000 butchers in the Shanghai International Settlement are in dispute due to their opposition to the four slaughter companies, Su-Xi-Ning-Hai, Ning-Hu, and Ren-Yuan, secretly adding transportation fees. They have repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate and sent letters of inquiry, but have not received a response. It is now known that the butchers have decided to jointly petition the Municipal Party Department to investigate. The original text is as follows: "Petition regarding the Su-Xi and other four slaughter companies taking advantage of their power to oppress and secretly add transportation fees for the industry, requesting a strict and thorough investigation to clarify the truth. We, the butchers, purchase pigs from various pig dealers in Wusong. In addition to the original price, we pay a handling fee of one dime, a pre-slaughter inspection fee of one dime, a tying fee of seven cents, and a transportation fee of two dimes (all advanced by the dealers). In the past, due to not understanding the truth, we had once negotiated with the pig dealers in Wusong. Subsequently, the four slaughter companies, Su-Xi-Ning-Hai, Ning-Hu, and Ren-Yuan, took on the responsibility of mediation. As a result, the handling fee was reduced by three cents, and the rest were acknowledged as advanced payments, and a settlement record was signed, declaring the matter resolved. It is now known that the transportation fee is only one dime and five cents per pig according to the transportation company that undertakes the work. The remaining five cents are secretly subsidized by the transportation company to the four slaughter companies, Su-Xi, Ning-Hai, Ning-Hu, and Ren-Yuan, as special expenses. The reason for this is that the slaughter companies take advantage of their power to oppress. When pigs are transported from the pig dealers to the slaughter companies for slaughter, the slaughter companies send staff to inspect them. If there are any shortages or deaths, the transportation company is required to compensate in full. The transportation company cannot bear the pain, so they secretly subsidize the four companies with five cents. According to the transportation company's subsidy, it is ultimately borne by us, the butchers. These four slaughter companies use such means to profit from it. Now that we, the butchers, know the inside story, we can transport the pigs ourselves. However, if we transport the pigs ourselves, the slaughter companies claim that they will refuse to slaughter the pigs. We, the butchers, originally slaughtered at the slaughter companies run by foreigners, and the prices were even cheaper. However, driven by patriotic sentiments, we do not want the rights to flow overseas. In addition, the current slaughter companies are produced by the meat industry association, and the association is also produced by us, the butchers. Now, these four slaughter companies are oppressing the industry in this way, illegally collecting fees, and regarding the association as their own private property, which is extremely illegal. We have repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate and sent letters of inquiry, but they have ignored us. We have no choice but to jointly petition your committee to promptly and thoroughly investigate the illegal fees charged by the four slaughter companies to clarify the truth and meet public expectations. In presenting this, we are extremely eager to await orders. We respectfully present this to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Department. Sincerely, over 500 Shanghai butchers, including Lu Gaojian."</p>

<p>The Ruose Hospital at the Matou Bridge in Songjiang has a tradition of having members of the Shanghai Chinese Catholic Action Association go there every summer to provide medical treatment and medicine to the poor and sick in the countryside. Yesterday was Sunday, and seven members of the association, Lu Zengzuo, Lu Zengli (son of Lu Bohong), Lu Qinren (grandson of Lu Bohong), Shi Zongkai, Zhou Sanbao, Tan Zhifang, etc., went there with the necessary medicines. They traveled by the Lu family's own car, license number 6500, driven by Lu Zengzuo himself, along the Songhu Highway. After finishing the treatment at about 2:00 PM, they returned to Shanghai in the original car. Unexpectedly, when the car passed Beiqiao and was approaching Zhuanqiao, the two rear wheels of the car suddenly burst at the same time, causing the car to become unmanageable for a while. In addition, the surface of the coal cinder road was uneven, causing the car to sway from side to side. Lu Zengzuo was momentarily careless, and the front of the car crashed into a wooden telephone pole on the side of the road. Lu urgently tried to steer away, but unexpectedly there was a riverbank next to the road. Due to the excessive steering, the car broke the telephone pole, overturned into the riverbank, and plunged into a paddy field with the bottom of the car facing the sky. Everyone in the car was seriously injured and unable to move. Fortunately, a villager caught sight of them and rushed forward to pull the injured out of the car and reported to the Zhuanqiao Township Office, which used the telephone to notify the Lu residence in Shijialong. The Lu residence immediately sent a car to the scene of the accident to transport the injured back. After hearing the news, the reporter went to inquire. It was learned that only the driver, Liu, was not injured. Shi Zongkai was the most seriously injured and had already died. Lu Zengzuo was injured in the waist, Lu Qinren's leg bone was broken, Zhou Sanbao was seriously injured in the head, Lu Zengli had minor head injuries, and Tan Zhifang had minor injuries. All were sent to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment to deal with the aftermath of the deceased.</p>

It is heard that Mei will go to Beijing in the next few days to report to the authorities. Yu Shangyuan will also accompany him. He said that he deeply feels that the effect of education is slow, and he plans to try to run a small theater in the south to educate society through drama, so that it will have a faster and more significant effect. However, whether the small theater will be in Beijing or Shanghai is still under planning.</p>

<p>Zhao Baoquan, a 47-year-old resident of Nantao Lane, No. 24 Lujiabang, Nanshi, made a living by emptying chamber pots. Because he owed Gong Zhang, a 59-year-old woman residing at No. 47 of the same lane, over 90 yuan in association fees, Gong had repeatedly urged Zhao to pay, but without success. There had been conflicts, which were dispersed by others. The night before, Gong Zhang again asked Zhao Baoquan to pay, but Zhao said that life was becoming more and more difficult, and where would he get extra money to repay the old debt? Moreover, Gong Zhang's residence was nearby, and they saw each other several times a day, and she would urge him to pay whenever they met, making him unbearable. Therefore, Zhao Baoquan suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. So, the night before, he bought six dimes worth of opium and broke into Gong Zhang's house to squat, waiting to die. Gong Zhang initially did not know that he had taken poison. It was not until the poison took effect that Zhao Baoquan's face turned pale and his mind became unclear. Gong Zhang was shocked when she saw this and immediately reported to the police, trying to find a way to rescue him, but it was too late. He died shortly after. The police detained Gong Zhang and took her to the Wenmiao Road Police Station. Yesterday morning, the 27th Xiu Di Bao, Tao Rong, was ordered to report to the local court to request an inquest. Subsequently, Prosecutor Ouyang Shu and Coroner Guan Zhiming were appointed to the scene. It was verified that the deceased, Zhao Baoquan, had died from poisoning. It was ruled that the body be coffined by the deceased's daughter, Mao Zhao. The police station will hand over Gong Zhang to the case after interrogation for investigation.</p>

<p>According to the Continental Daily, Ren Jia, a Russian, does not engage in honest work. On Saturday night, he stole car number 7069 parked on Avenue Albert. He overturned a rickshaw near Rue Poussin, seriously injuring a member of the U.S. Fourth Marine Corps who was a passenger. Ren Jia did not stop and continued to drive. Soon after, he collided with another car. This was seen by a Russian chauffeur from the American Automobile Company at No. 101 Avenue Albert, who knew that Ren Jia was not a good person. Two of them immediately drove the company's car to chase him. They caught up with him near Route Cardinal Mercier. Ren Jia abandoned the car and fled. One of the pursuers also got out of the car and chased after him closely. He soon grabbed Ren Jia, but Ren Jia took out a gun and made a threatening gesture. The pursuer let go. Ren Jia, fearing being seen by the police, abandoned the gun and continued to flee. The pursuer saw that he had no weapons and chased after him again, handing him over to a Chinese constable in the French Concession. The Chinese constable took Ren Jia back to the American Automobile Company and reported to the police station by telephone. Ren Jia then took the opportunity to escape again and disappeared without a trace. As of late last night, the police had not yet captured him, but because they knew his appearance in detail, they believed that he would eventually be caught soon.</p>

<p>Zhu He, from Sheng County, Zhejiang, used to run a redwood workshop in Lujiabang, Nanshi. In May of the 14th year of the Republic of China, Wang, the wife of Zhu Sanjin, a clan brother of Zhu He, was beautiful and quite promiscuous. She became acquainted with Xu Sanquan, a worker in the redwood workshop. Unexpectedly, the affair was discovered by Zhu Sanjin, who was consumed by jealousy. He spoke to Zhu He about his wife's adultery, wanting to find an opportunity to catch them and not remain silent. Zhu He advised him to be tolerant for the sake of family honor and repeatedly advised him. He also warned Wang to repent and start anew. Unexpectedly, Wang's wild nature was difficult to tame, and she did not listen to good advice. Soon after, she and her lover, Xu Sanquan, fled together. After Wang fled, Zhu Sanjin resented Zhu He for not stopping them, otherwise he would have brought the adulterer and adulteress to justice earlier. So, he gathered people to negotiate with Zhu He. On the evening of the 27th of that month, at around 10:00 PM, Zhu Sanjin and others gathered at Zhu He's doorstep, called Zhu He outside, and without asking why, hacked at him with axes. Zhu He was outnumbered and was immediately hacked to death. The murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in a panic. Afterwards, the local Bao reported to the local court prosecutor, who arrived at the scene and found that the deceased's head had been hacked open and his brains were flowing out. It was confirmed that he had died from the injuries. The body was identified, and three accomplices were arrested, interrogated, and sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment. The sentence was confirmed and they were sent to prison. Unexpectedly, after more than a decade, the old case was brought up again. Zhu Xiaobu, who lives near Beichujiaqiao, is the brother of Zhu He.

Later, his family took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. It is said that the reason for Cai's attack was related to love.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Products Company on Nanjing Road has been closed since June 4th. Although some people have advocated for its reopening, it has been shelved due to unresolved debts and the inability to absorb cash. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the company held a general meeting of shareholders on the third floor of the Industrial Bank of Nanjing Road. It was estimated that over 10,000 shares were present, with over 20 shareholder representatives. The acting lawyers Wang Jian'e and Zhang Henghai were present, and the chairman, Hong Yanbin, and recorder, Zhu Dechao, were publicly elected. First, the chairman gave a report, stating that the company has been closed for two months, and whether to reopen has not been decided. Therefore, a general meeting of shareholders has been convened. If everyone is willing to reopen, they must take out money to work on reopening. Otherwise, it will be dissolved. Then, acting lawyer Wang Jian'e reported on the company's assets and liabilities, stating that the liabilities were about 800,000 yuan, the existing goods could be mortgaged for about 200,000 yuan, and the amount owed to the company by outsiders was about 300,000 taels.

<h3 id="e131">620,000 Red Pills Seized from Rubber Shoes and Pillow Cores in Wooden Boxes, Discovered by Staff at the North Cargo Depot on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Reported to Be Transported to Xin'an County, Longhai Railway—The Receiving Clerk of the Huitong Transit Company Evades— <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The North Cargo Depot on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is located at the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Baoshan Road. At around 10:40 AM yesterday, Mao Fengsui, a cargo clerk at the depot, suddenly felt that two wooden boxes of rubber shoes and pillow cores, reported by the Huitong Transit Company office at No. 799 Qiujiang Road to be transported to Yuda Public and Xinxin Store in Xin'an County, Longhai Road, seemed suspicious when weighing and loading the goods. They did not seem to be the weight of such goods. He asked the reporter of the company to open the boxes, but the reporter claimed that he needed to report to the company and never returned. The depot then, together with Station Master Qi, Section Chief Zhong of the Railway Police Section, and Patrol Officer Hong Wenxin from the North Station Branch, dispatched police officer Wang Xubin to open the two boxes for inspection. It was found that there were two iron boxes, 12 inches long, 7 inches wide, and 5 inches high, each containing 6 packages of red pills. Therefore, the goods in the boxes were completely emptied, and it was discovered that the boxes were two-layered with a height of 5 inches. In the bottom of the boxes, there were 50 packages of red pills, each package containing 10,000 pills, totaling 620,000 pills, weighing 56 kilograms. At that time, the North Station Branch and the two Railway Police Sections immediately reported the discovery of a large number of drugs to their superiors and dispatched senior police officers to the company's office on Qiujiang Road to search. However, the staff at the office had already fled. They issued a notice to the Huitong Police Station and sent detectives to the Huitong General Company at the intersection of Jielu and Kene Hai Road to summon Fang, the accountant and an employee of the company, for questioning. They claimed that the goods were recruited by the company's receiving department, so the director of the receiving department, Pan Lansheng, must be responsible. However, Pan and more than ten employees of the receiving department had already fled. They promised to look for them. Fang and others then signed a guarantee on the spot to go out and investigate. It was not until yesterday that they learned that Pan Lansheng and others were hiding in the Andong Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. They went to the Yongxing Road Police Station to arrest them and take them back to the police section. The office of the company was sealed off by the police, and all the drugs have been sent to the garrison headquarters. The main criminals will be sent for trial after the interrogation is confirmed. As for the responsible personnel of Huitong Company who were summoned, it is said that they are still in Suzhou and have not returned. Therefore, the origin of the drugs and who entrusted them will be revealed soon. It is also known that the company was found by the Road Bureau last month to have committed fraud in the transportation of goods, so the contract for transporting goods signed by the company and the Road Bureau was terminated long ago. Unexpectedly, they are now secretly transporting drugs, which can be said to be disregarding the law.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association: Report on the Establishment Process Over the Past Year <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In Shanghai, considering only the Public Concession, there are nearly 10,000 rickshaws. Directly or indirectly, more than 100,000 people rely on pulling these 10,000 rickshaws for a living. Most of them live extremely hard lives, lack organization and training, and are facing further threats in this global economic downturn. As rickshaw pullers, they are replacing machine power and their livelihoods are under threat. To improve the lives of rickshaw pullers within the Concession, the Public Works Department organized a committee to study improvement plans for the purpose of salvaging the situation. After five months of detailed research, the committee drafted sixteen suggestions for improving the current rickshaw system, and submitted them to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department. Except for items one, two, and three, which were reserved, the remaining thirteen items were approved by the Board of Directors and a Rickshaw Affairs Committee was established. Massey, Zhu Mao Cheng, and Wang Zhi Ren were invited to serve as committee members to implement the plan. Thus, items such as (1) rickshaw owner registration, (2) rickshaw style improvement, (3) reducing rickshaw rent by 25%, and (4) rickshaw puller registration were actively carried out. At the same time, the Public Works Department also considered the benefits of establishing a rickshaw pullers mutual aid association, and organized a rickshaw pullers mutual aid association management department, which was established on July 13th of last year. The Bureau designated three committee members as custodians. Later, the committee invited social figures Li Denghui, Peng Jin, Xie Andao, Tao Deman, Ying Shugui, Qiu Zitong, Deng Yuzhi, and representatives from the rickshaw businesses Yin Zhiling and Gu Songmao, to form a board of directors, purely for the welfare of rickshaw pullers, based on their own efforts and mutual aid. The board of directors then organized an executive department, inviting Mr. Zhang Dengying to serve as the general manager to carry out all association affairs. As for the association's expenses, each rickshaw was charged seven cents of silver per day, collected by the rickshaw owner on behalf of the association. This burden on the rickshaw pullers was not too difficult, as the Public Works Department reduced the daily rickshaw rent to seventy-eight cents, requiring them to contribute only a few cents per day to the mutual aid association, which was much less than the previous rent of fourteen cents per day. On November 5th of the same year, a temporary general assembly of the rickshaw pullers mutual aid association was established on the upper floor of the Xiaocaichang in Dongjiaxing Road, Hongkou. On the 29th, a western district branch was established in Tailai Lane, McGonigal Road. The association's articles of association and detailed rules for implementation were also amended and approved by the Board of Directors of the Bureau in March of this year. This is a general overview of the establishment of the mutual aid association.</p>
<p>Currently, the outside world seems to have some unclear understanding or incorrect observations regarding the expansion of the association's internal affairs. Therefore, a report on the key points of the current situation inside the association, based on a recent visit, is provided for the attention and reference of all sectors of society.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, the chairman first reported on the preparatory process and future prospects.

It was approved by the Ministry of Military Affairs and the city's party and government agencies, and the participants were enthusiastic. However, the results of the competition were far less than the foreign records. It is deeply felt that it is difficult to compete with the carrier pigeons of the great powers if we do not rise up quickly to study. Therefore, on June 30, carrier pigeon comrades in the city were summoned to the park to solicit opinions and hold a preparatory meeting for the Pigeon Research Association. On July 5, membership forms were sent out, and a draft of the articles of association was prepared and submitted to the Bureau of Education for record. Later, on the 30th of last month, an order was issued to copy and distribute the amended articles of association of the association. Therefore, on August 1, letters were sent to all comrades to convene the inaugural meeting. Today, I am very pleased that all comrades have come despite 冒 (indistinct). In the future, I hope that the meeting will be attended on time, give great opinions, and work together to promote progress.

<p>Ruan Kaiki, director of the News Sub-Bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, issued Instruction No. 20 of the Government Character yesterday, which stated that according to a letter from the White Cross Charity Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, "The hospital is affiliated to the Pushan Villa Board of Directors and specializes in obstetrics, gynecology and outpatient clinics, giving medicine to help the poor and sick. The annual question support is no less than 10,000 yuan. In the past, it has always been free of charge for the police officers of your bureau, serving the public, and all impoverished civilians are also exempt. It has been ten years since then, but the city has not been prosperous recently, and donations have been exhausted, and the economy is particularly difficult. According to the people under your jurisdiction, whenever there is a quarrel, there are often injuries or poisoning, etc., and the number of people sent to the hospital for treatment is large, and none of them are signed up, and the hospital has suffered a lot. According to this kind of injured or poisoned person, they are all taking their own disasters, and they should not be treated for free. Fees must be registered and charged according to regulations. I specially present this letter to your director, hoping that you will consider the hospital's financial difficulties and allow your subordinates to be informed that those who are injured or poisoned and sent to the hospital for treatment in the future must pay fees in accordance with the regulations in order to maintain good deeds, and please give an announcement to be observed. Wait, etc., before. According to this sub-bureau, there are often long-term police officers leading family members and friends to the hospital for medical treatment, and they do not pay fees in accordance with the regulations, which is really tarnishing the reputation of the police. You must know that the hospital's preferential free treatment for the sub-bureau's long-term police officers due to illness is already an exception. How can family members and friends be led to seek free treatment? That is, in the future, the people who are injured in assaults or who commit suicide by poisoning and are sent for treatment must also be warned to pay fees in accordance with the regulations, so as not to cause losses to the hospital. This is very important. In addition to the sub-order and announcement, it is ordered to abide by and forward to all long-term police officers to abide by, mother violates this order.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Sauce Garden Industry Association, for the sake of tax-free inferior soy sauce on the market, mixed and sold in various places, united with the industry associations of various cities and counties in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei to petition, and after chemical examination by the Central Health Testing Institute, it was found to be toxic and harmful to health. The original text presented to Zhu Tingqi, director of the Salt Affairs Department, is recorded as follows. Presentation is for tax-free toxic and fake soy sauce, mixed and sold in various places, infringing on business, affecting national tax, and endangering people's livelihood. Please reiterate the prohibition order, clearly define the regulations, and strictly ban things. This kind of toxic fake soy sauce started in Shanghai in the 22nd year. After Chen Qingqing Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy's Office, presented Finance Department Salt Character No. 10359 instruction, the Department presented a piece, for the private production of soy sauce essence in the Chinese Concession, which hinders hygiene, and affects the sale of taxes, and has now ordered the bureau to circulate the investigation and prohibition, please approve the record, and transfer the consultation to the prohibition, the inside open presentation is known, has been transferred to the Ministry of Justice and Administration, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has ordered strict prohibition, etc. Because it has been a long time, it has become more and more serious, and traitors have used chemical products, such as salt, alkali, and monosodium glutamate waste liquid, etc., mixed with soy sauce color to falsely claim to be soy sauce, and sold in various places. It is well known that monosodium glutamate waste vouchers contain malt. Salt alkali and essence are even more harmful. Fake soy sauce deceives the world and seeks profit. Although Meng Jushu has ordered that if it is not made of salt and soy sauce, it should not be mixed with the name of soy sauce, so as to prevent the sale of soy sauce and salt tax on record, until the execution, so that the seller sells himself, and the ban becomes a mere formality, and it has evolved into the soy sauce of various places of Junliang heavy tax, the business has plummeted, and the salt is difficult to determine the amount, and at this time, the people's livelihood is declining, the purchasing power is weak, and there are many simple people with knowledge, and they cannot know that this contains toxic substances, only greedy prices are cheap, and they are deceived by it. If this continues for a long time, if we do not ban it as soon as possible, not only will the soy sauce industry be eliminated, the people in this industry will lose their jobs, and the loss of national tax will be very serious, and the people's livelihood will be greatly related. The association seems unable to remain silent. It is reasonable to unite with the related injured industry associations in various provinces to continue to present Qingting, and seek approval to quickly issue prohibition rules, and order all subordinates to strictly implement them, so as to maintain national tax and national livelihood, and the urgency of waiting for orders.</p>

<p>Shanghai Public Concession Public Rickshaw Puller Registration and License Date has been截止 (ended) on July 31, and after that, any rickshaw puller who has not been registered and licensed is not allowed to engage in car pulling business within the boundary, which is really a last resort to maintain the livelihood of the original rickshaw pullers within the boundary, but since August 1st, within a month, the public rickshaw puller will be re-registered, All rickshaw pullers who are already engaged in car pulling business in Shanghai but have not been registered and licensed can go to registration immediately, and in the future, among the licensed rickshaw pullers, if there is a vacancy, the license will be given to the rickshaw pullers who have been registered to supplement it, If so, the number of public rickshaws in Shanghai is limited, and the livelihood of the existing rickshaw pullers can also be maintained. In the future, poor villagers from various places who intend to come to Shanghai to pull cars for a living are afraid that they will waste their travel expenses and work hard for nothing. Therefore, the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Bureau specially issued a notice and sent letters to the Shanghai fellow villagers associations and newspapers in various places, asking them to guide and dissuade the poor villagers in various places who want to come to Shanghai to pull cars for a living, so as to avoid the suffering of wading and wandering.</p>

<p>A young man from Anhui, Huang Yannian, sixteen years old this year, entered the Tongchuntang Pharmacy on Jiujiang Road two years ago to learn the trade. Recently, he was ordered by the shop owner to take money to Shanghai to procure medicine and return. The shop owner discovered that two of the medicines he procured were incorrect. Angered, the shop owner immediately fired Huang. Huang then took a boat to Shanghai on the 22nd of last month to find friends to make a living. Unexpectedly, he could not find them anywhere, and the travel expenses he had brought were used up. Helpless, Huang drifted in Shanghai, reduced to begging. He was even bullied by a beggar named Lao Yang San, who prevented him from begging for food in Shanghai and even beat him. Under the humiliation and suffering from hunger, and with no hope for the future, Huang considered suicide. He jumped into the Huangpu River near the French Concession the day before yesterday. Two detectives from the French Concession police station, Bu Zhenglong and Yang Zhongfang, happened to pass by and saw him. They immediately ordered a boatman to rescue Huang and brought him to the police station. After learning about the above situation, the Chinese and foreign officers at the police station were moved with compassion. They immediately raised funds to buy him a boat ticket to return to his hometown. Huang thanked them and left.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Recent Achievements of Huiren Hospital: 72-Year-Old Successfully Quits Smoking, Woman in Sixth Month of Miscarriage Recovers Health <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Huiren Hospital, located at the intersection of Baker Road and Chengdu Road in this city, was founded by famous Chinese and German doctors. It specializes in treating opium addiction, providing obstetric services, and other departments. Recently, due to the government's strict prohibition of opium, many addicts have resolved to quit smoking to avoid legal sanctions. As a result, the number of people quitting smoking in the hospital has surged, and the beds are often full. Last month, statistics showed that fifty to sixty people were discharged after successfully quitting. Among them was a seventy-two-year-old man from Dalian who had been smoking for more than twenty years. He quit smoking in ten days and said that he felt no pain during the process, and that he felt refreshed and his appetite had increased greatly. The hospital's obstetrics department originally charged three yuan for delivery plus medication and injection fees. However, some families were unable to estimate the expenses, and unscrupulous hospitals often demanded twenty or thirty yuan or more for injections and medicines, which caused much hardship to the families. In view of this, the hospital has specifically introduced a safe delivery service, which includes all delivery procedures, medication, and injections, for only ten yuan, with no extra charges. Therefore, it is very popular among families. Dr. Hans, a German expert with thirty years of experience, has performed tens of millions of surgeries and can cure miscarriages and difficult births. During a consultation the other day, a woman in her sixth month of pregnancy had a miscarriage with severe bleeding and was unconscious and in critical condition. Dr. Hans performed surgery and restored her health within twenty minutes. She was hospitalized for two days and discharged safely. It can be said to be miraculous.</p>

<p>Respected Editor, We have recently read the news item in your newspaper of the 4th of this month, in the "Local News" column, about being deceived in the recruitment of employees, which concerns us and is inconsistent with the facts and extremely shocking. After investigation, this case was entirely the work of Liu Zhengfang alone, and we were completely implicated. The French Concession Police Station in Lujiawan has thoroughly investigated and clarified the matter. In addition to strictly arresting Liu Zhengfang, we have long since been released and restored to freedom. We are deeply concerned that the outside world may misunderstand, so we are writing to correct this. Sincerely, Guo Ping, Sheng Yueqiu, August 4th. Addressed to the Editor of Shen Bao.</p>
<h3 id="e162">In Memory of Mr. Wang Junqing <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Junqing of Wuxing has passed away, and another elder statesman of the literary world has gone. I was deeply saddened by the news, and I cannot help but recall the various aspects of his life.</p>
<p>Mr. Junqing, whose courtesy name was Wenru, also known as Xinjiuwu, was a Mingjing during the Qing Dynasty. He was in charge of compiling and editing books at the Progressive Bookstore and the Rotary Club for many years. Later, he worked at the Zhonghua Civilization Ershu Bureau, editing and publishing books such as couplets and correspondence, which scholars regarded as authoritative. His greatest contribution was the "Shuoku," "Biji Daguan," and "Xiangyan Congshu," which he collated and compiled, adding summaries and annotations. His contribution to the compilation and organization of the national legacy is still remembered today. He also co-edited Xiangyan Zazhi with Zhang Mansun, Gao Taichi, and Zou Jiugai, which ceased publication after several issues due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was tall and dignified, with sharp eyes and a kind demeanor that was easy to approach. He was especially happy to encourage younger generations. I met Mr. Wang several years ago when he was residing on Hartung Road in Shanghai. Whenever I had time, I would visit him. He would be collating and compiling selections of poetry from past dynasties at the bookstore, and we would sit knee-to-knee and talk for hours. Later, Mr. Wang built a house in Wuzhong, east of the North Temple Pagoda on Shitang Bridge, calling it "Jiuxin Yi," where he lived in seclusion. We exchanged letters once or twice a month as a matter of course. In his letters, he always inquired about my livelihood and circumstances, and his sincerity was overflowing in his words. I was moved to tears when I read them, knowing that such a fortunate encounter was not easy to come by in these declining times. Last autumn, I returned to Suzhou for my wife's family affairs. Her family was close to Jiuxin Yi, and I went to visit the place. I found that the exquisite verandas and gardens, once filled with colorful and vibrant flowers, were now full of cockscomb and goosefoot flowers. Autumn colors filled the eye. Mr. Wang strolled among them, pointing and saying to me, "You often write about fruits and flowers. Why not collect and supplement the writings into a special book?" This was the motivation for me to write a book of flower and fruit sketches. After the book was completed, I sent it to Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang praised it greatly, but in reality, it was crude and messy, and not worthy of the attention of a connoisseur. Mr. Wang came to Shanghai two months ago and honored me with a visit, but I was out and missed him. It was as if fate had deliberately withheld this last meeting. Thinking of it today, I am filled with regret.</p>
<p>Shen Sanbai's "Six Records of a Floating Life" is a good read for lyrical and narrative prose. It was originally a manuscript that Mr. Wang first discovered and entrusted to his friend Huang Moses to arrange for printing, thus making it widely available to the public. However, two of the records were lost, which Mr. Wang still regretted. He repeatedly searched for them and finally obtained the lost manuscripts from his fellow villagers, intending to reprint them and make them available to the world. Mr. Wang has died. I wonder if anyone will be able to complete his unfinished wish.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang enjoyed making riddles. In the past, there was the Ping Society in Shanghai, and Mr. Wang was a prominent member. He occasionally wrote couplets, which were always popular. One day, the senior Sun Yusheng presented the couplet "Three birds harm people: crow, sparrow, bustard," and Mr. Wang responded with "A hundred insects give way: tiger, bear, grizzly bear." His colleagues praised it as ingenious. He also occasionally wrote clock poems, such as the embroidered cloud and wild goose footprint style: "Lakes and mountains embroider the land of three heroes, clouds and rivers create a heaven of five colors." It was elegant and appropriate, unparalleled. "Embroidered cloud heaven" was the former site of the Immortal World on Four Horse Road.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he wrote tens of thousands of words in the form of couplets, riddles, clock poems, as well as poems, prose, notes, and miscellanies. This spring, he entrusted me with the task of publishing them, but I was unable to do so in the end. Now that he has passed away forever, I feel deeply guilty.</p>

<p>— (Yan Maode)</p>
<p>Many people seem to think that ambition is something innate and does not require artificial improvement. But in reality, most ambitions are hidden and need to be awakened and stimulated.</p>
<p>Ambition is something that is extremely sensitive to external stimuli. Once awakened, it still needs constant attention and education, just like the talent for music and art needs attention and education, otherwise it will wither and die.</p>
<p>If we have ambition but do not want to realize it, then our ambition will not maintain a sharp and fixed dynamic, and our talents will become dull and lose their ability.</p>
<p>Often lift yourself out of all troubles and sufferings and immerse yourself in a harmonious, beautiful, and good environment. This ability can truly be considered priceless.</p>

<p>People who walk through Zhaohui Garden and Bailinan Road Bridge know that there is a group of Russian beggars there. Because they have nothing to do, they all drift there, and every day, they only rely on begging for copper coins to make a living.</p>
<p>Laogen is one of them. He can speak fluent Shandong dialect, and he also understands Chinese things. According to him, "He used to work in the 'gun repair shop' of a certain warlord's army, and his salary was eighty yuan a month. He could repair pots, cannons, and rifles. Now, if there is nothing to do, there is no way to do anything. "Every day, in addition to the incense and bread, all the money he begged for is used to buy alcohol. I don't know how many times a day he drinks. They can "undeservingly" say the words "addicted to alcohol."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Laogen bought food at a small restaurant next door. I asked him, "Why do you like alcohol so much?" He replied, "You can't beg for money without drinking alcohol. It's so embarrassing to stretch out your hand and ask Chinese girls for money. If they say no, I won't have the face to ask again. If I eat enough wine, I will have the old face and not be afraid of embarrassment. I will pull the handlebars of the rickshaw and must ask for two copper coins."</p>
<p>After he finished eating, I gave him a copy of Shen Bao and asked him, "Do you know Chinese characters?" He took the newspaper, pointed to the sentences, and hummed the tune of a Western song. Everyone laughed, and I said to him, "It's not like that in the newspaper." He was very alert and immediately turned his voice and sang a "Down with the Powers" "Chinese Revolutionary Song", without a single mistake, and said, "This China has." Later, I asked him to sing another one, and he stretched out his hand and asked for five copper coins.</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 17 Don't Ask About a Daughter's Body; It's Hard to Speak of Hidden Pain; Everyone Looks at the Noble Face, Sharing High Virtues</p>
<p>Today, I came to find him, but there was no sign of the matter of writing a letter of introduction to Qian that he spoke of. Mr. Jia promised to find iron, but he said he needed to handle it first. It was hard to find him, and only then did I get the train ticket money. As for his own, he didn't mention a word. I tried to probe his tone several times, but he was always ambiguous. I can see that he intends to deceive me. As he spoke, he took out a small handkerchief from his pocket and slowly wiped his eyes. After Zhichun guessed what had happened to him, he also felt sorry for him. He sighed and said, "Miss Yang, it's not that I'm saying you now, but you also have faults. You yourself are a downcast woman, so you shouldn't have stubbornly rejected the matchmaker and forced the Zhu family girl to be sold off. If she really becomes a concubine and saves the lives of herself, her mother, and her grandmother, that would be fine. But I think that Mr. Jia is also temporarily impulsive with sexual desire, spending one or two hundred yuan to find such a girl to relieve his boredom. If he is unhappy one day, does he still want her? But then again, if he really becomes unhappy after five or seven days and abandons Miss Zhu, it doesn't matter, at most he will ruin her body, but her life is still there. I'm afraid he will take her out of Tongguan. Can he really let Miss Zhu's grandmother and mother follow him? At that time, if he abandons Miss Zhu, this girl who has never seen the world will have no way to call for help and no way to enter. Wouldn't she be walking into a dead end?" When Huanhua heard this, she still didn't say anything. After a long time, she replied, "I think Mr. Jia likes her so much now that even if he changes his mind in the future, he will always give her a way out and will never abandon her and not ask."

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Until that evening, her thoughts had not been resolved, so that her spirit was very uneasy, so that no matter how small things, she was always weighed on the ground. The common characteristics of most old people, a kind of irritable and easily angry characteristics, she at this time had fully manifested itself. But as she was about to enter dinner, her depression suddenly released itself, because she had begun to speak, and what she said was the passage she had just hidden in her stomach. The first to speak with her was me. Her first sentence was a question, but this question was very strange, I really never expected. She asked me:</p>
<p>"Have you ever been beaten by anyone?"</p>
<p>This question simply stunned me, and I couldn't answer for a while. Have I ever been beaten by anyone? This question for me, a person who is well-off and well-fed, is unnecessary to ask, and is absolutely impossible! "Beating" This kind of punishment was originally for the servants, eunuchs and slaves. I myself admit that when I was young, because of my violent nature, whenever the servants or maids at home did something wrong and angered me, I would have to beat them a few times; and after they were beaten, they would have to kneel down and kowtow to me, thanking me for beating them, and vowing never to do it again. These things, in our view, seem to be very appropriate; but I should be beaten by someone, or is it my father and mother? But my mother is the most soft and gentle, she doesn't beat the servants, how can she beat me? Although my father was a little strict, he never raised his hand to beat me, and even a loud scolding can be said to have never happened! (381)</p>

<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>All kinds of insects, fish, and shrimp: often transform. Such as A, can be transformed into B. Previously this magazine published "Whispers of Willow Catkins," saying, "Sometimes falling on people's books, it will become a bookworm. If it falls into a green grass pond, it will turn into duckweed. This is of course a matter: but a certain gentleman also made a "Debate on Willow Catkins," saying, "The sons of fish and shrimp can be transformed into locust nymphs." Also "Rotting grass turns into fireflies," there is no such thing. And it also involved the Journey to the West, saying that these things, like Sun Wukong pulling out a few hairs, can sew up something, are myths. In my opinion: these words are too narrow-minded. Not to mention others, after the Beginning of Summer, water rats can turn into crucian carp. I used to live in Suzhou, and behind my residence was a river. I personally saw a crucian carp dragging a rat tail, which had not yet transformed successfully. Also, the centipede used in the drugstore is planted with chicken feathers and hair. First, dig the soil to a foot deep, put the chicken feathers and hair inside, and then gently cover the top with soil. After about a week, open it, and many centipedes will be found inside, and the chicken feathers and hair will also be transformed into birds. Furthermore, goldfish can be grown with celestial silkworms, as the celestial silkworm told me. These are all credible and evidenced; in short, although science is now developed, these things should also be studied. They should not be dismissed as superstitious and mythical things, and despised.</p>
<p>The other day I read "The Nutrition of Fruits" in this magazine: it said that "the juice of peaches is the same as pears. People with fever should eat more peach juice to relieve the fever." etc.: According to the nature of peaches, which is hot, everyone knows this. The Materia Medica also says "Peaches are pungent and sour, sweet and hot, and slightly toxic. Eating too much can cause heat, and cause boils." The nature of pears is cool, clearing lung heat, and the functions are completely different. If used to treat fever, wouldn't it be treating heat with heat, which is useless and harmful? Children are purely yang in nature, and should not eat too much. In ancient times, peaches were listed as the lowest of the five fruits. That's what it means!</p>

<h3 id="e169">Frozen Delicacies for Summer <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Mustard</p>
<p>In the scorching summer heat, rich and heavy foods are difficult to swallow. My wife, Peiyu, is skilled at making fruit jellies and similar desserts, which can be served as snacks or as part of a larger meal. Their refreshing coolness greatly enhances the appetite. Here are several methods for making them:</p>
<p>Apple Jelly: Take several apples, peel them, and slice them thinly. Soak the slices in an appropriate amount of water and simmer gently. When the fruit is soft, squeeze the juice through a cloth to filter out the solids. Add sugar and bring to a boil. Pour the mixture into a bowl and place it in the refrigerator or cold water for about half an hour until it becomes a clear jelly.</p>
<p>Lemon Jelly: Soak seven or eight maces of agar-agar in cold water until soft. Then, take two fresh lemons, slice them thinly with the peel on, place them in a clean pot, add several large cups of water, and boil. Strain to remove the solids. Add the agar-agar and three or four taels of sugar. Wait for the agar-agar to dissolve, then pour into a mold and surround with ice. Soon it will become lemon jelly.</p>
<p>Chocolate Powder Jelly: Mix rice flour, milk, and white sugar with water and steam over water to form a paste. Make another paste using fine flour and rose essence or juice using the same method. Then, make a separate paste with flour and several blocks of chocolate. Take a pre-made mold, first pour in the white paste, then the chocolate paste, and finally the rose-colored paste. Steam gently over low heat, occasionally moistening with orange juice. Place in cold water to set.</p>
<p>Goose Breast Jelly: Take cleaned goose breasts and soak them in a mixture of red wine, soy sauce essence, and vinegar for about three hours. Place them in a pot, add water, spices, spring onions, lemon peel, bay leaves, coriander, and other ingredients. Simmer gently until cooked. Remove and cut into square pieces. Separately, cook veal, adding red wine, soy sauce, and vinegar. Strain the juice through a cloth and pour it over the goose breasts. Place in a ventilated area or cold water. It will solidify quickly, making it an excellent appetizer for hot weather.</p>
<p>Chicken Breast Jelly: The method is the same as for goose breast jelly.</p>
<p>Mullet Jelly: Take a mullet, remove the scales and internal organs, and cut it in half. Wash it clean with water. Place it in a pot with water, vinegar, red wine, soy sauce, spices, a small amount of coriander and spring onions, bay leaves, lemon, and other ingredients. Simmer gently. After removing it, pour beef broth (with the fat removed) over it. Place it in a cool place for a short time, and it will solidify into a firm mullet jelly.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Cochet Arrives in Shanghai – Performance Facing Difficulties – Amateurs Cannot Compete Against Professionals – Possibly Enlisting Canavarro's Help <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Former French Davis Cup representative and world professional tennis player Cochet will come to Shanghai in early autumn to perform. He has already made arrangements with Qiu Feihai of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, which has attracted much attention in Shanghai's tennis circles. However, since Cochet is now a professional player, the relationship between professional and amateur players means that Cochet's performance in Shanghai, as it stands, may not have much hope.</p>
<p>Greatest Difficulty</p>
<p>The biggest difficulty is the regulation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation, which prohibits amateur players from competing against professional players in any match, otherwise they will lose their amateur status. After the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club received news of Cochet's arrival in Shanghai, it telegraphed the British Lawn Tennis Association to inquire whether it could hold an exhibition match with Cochet, but has not yet received a reply from London, and it is feared that it may not be allowed. As for the National Sports Federation, it is also unlikely to allow Chinese amateur players to compete against him, as it is bound by the rules of the World Amateur Sports Association.</p>
<p>Singapore's Side</p>
<p>Cochet is currently touring Malaysia and India. When he passed through Singapore, the Malaysian Lawn Tennis Association had planned to compete with Cochet, but it was abandoned because it was not allowed by the International Lawn Tennis Federation. The situation in Hong Kong is likely to be the same. With Singapore and Hong Kong in this situation, Shanghai is unlikely to be an exception.</p>
<p>Hopes for Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>The only hope is that when Cochet comes to Shanghai in the future, he can have a match with his coach, or with Canavarro, the only professional tennis player in Shanghai. If Shanghai tennis players are willing to give up their amateur status, they may also play a match with Cochet.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Sino-Japanese Tennis Exhibition – Lin Baohua Loses Again – Japanese Players Achieve Complete Victory <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Japanese tennis players, at the invitation of the China Lawn Tennis Club, competed again yesterday at the club's courts on Singapore Road. The main event was the battle between the two Lins. After Baohua lost to the Japanese player Lin at the French Club last time, he was quite unwilling and intended to make a do-or-die effort yesterday to avenge his previous defeat. However, the result was that he lost two rounds in a row, and his performance was even worse than last time. Due to De's absence from the doubles, Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai teamed up instead, but they were also defeated. Zhang Dingzhao's technique has indeed improved a lot recently. Shi Guiya was far from his match, and Shi only won three games in the two sets. Now that the Japanese players have completed their journey in Shanghai, they boarded a ship last night and returned with a complete victory (the match against the Shanghai Club has been cancelled).</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Dingzhao 6-2 6-1 Shi Guiya</p>
<p>The opening match was a cameo between Zhang Dingzhao and Shi Guiya. Zhang was steady and experienced, without any rashness. His forehand cross-court shots were especially powerful, and Shi Guiya was unable to control them and found it difficult to parry. As a result of the two sets, Zhang won very easily, and Shi Guiya only won three games.</p>
<p>(2) Lin (Japan) 6-2 6-4 Lin Baohua</p>
<p>The second match was a singles match between the two Lins. Meeting for the second time, the battle was particularly fierce. The long baseline shots were beautiful and pleasing to the eye, and the Japanese player's half-court diagonal shots were sharp and extraordinary. The net rushes and volleys were also very wonderful. Lin Baohua had almost no way to win, and repeatedly self-destructed, increasing the opponent's chances of winning. Judging from yesterday's match, Lin Baohua's technique was far inferior to that of Lin.</p>
<p>Fujii Kuramitsu (Japan) 6-3 6-3 Lin Baohua Qiu Feihai</p>
<p>In the final doubles, due to De's absence, Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai teamed up again. As a result, they lost again by two sets of 6-3. The Japanese player Fujii's net blocking and high pressure were delicate, crisp, and fiercely extraordinary. Kuramitsu was slightly worse. Lin and Qiu had no surprising tactics, and were far inferior in terms of technique.</p>
<p>Chinese Baseball Team Loses to McCaslin II – Thirteen to Four –</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Baseball League, the Chinese team played against McCaslin II yesterday at Shen Park. The Chinese team suffered another defeat, ending with a score of thirteen to four, with McCaslin taking the victory. In the fourth inning, the Chinese team had men on all three bases and was in a good position to score, but unfortunately it fell short. In the seventh inning, due to a mistake by McCaslin's outfielder, three players scored consecutively. The scores for each inning are as follows:</p>
<p>McCaslin II 3 2 1 0 0 0 1 3 3 – 13 points</p>
<p>(Inning) (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)</p>

<p>Xianfang Cup League – China Steadily Wins the Championship – Triumphant and Unstoppable</p>
<p>The Xianfang Cup Tennis League held its twelfth act yesterday as scheduled. Except for the result of Green Light winning over Xiaguang with a score of 11-4, the details of which will be recorded later, the rest are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>China Wins Industry…14-1</p>
<p>The Chinese team is full of vigor and wins every battle. The Industrial team is naturally difficult to compete against them. Calculating that they have played nine times, except for the third doubles match against scattered players which has not yet been played, they have already won 117 points, leading the way, and the championship should be within easy reach. In addition, the "small championships" for the two singles and the first doubles are held by the team's two famous generals, Lin Baohua and Zhang Dingzhao, which is also a sure thing, and is a rare and amazing achievement in the Cup League.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Ministry of Education Order – Provisional Regulations for Senior Midwifery Schools <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities on the 4th, stating: "Upon investigation, the Provisional Regulations for Senior Midwifery Vocational Schools have been formulated by the Ministry. The previously promulgated Provisional Standards for the School System and Curriculum of Midwifery Schools should be abolished immediately. We hereby issue a copy of the Provisional Regulations for your compliance and instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly."</p>
<p>Provisional Regulations for Senior Midwifery Vocational Schools</p>
<p>1. Senior Midwifery Vocational Schools aim to train midwifery and maternal and infant health personnel. 2. In addition to the provisions of Article 7 of the Revised Vocational School Regulations, the age of admission to Senior Midwifery Vocational Schools may be set at 18 to 30 years old, depending on the circumstances. 3. The length of study at Senior Midwifery Vocational Schools is set at three years. The first academic year focuses on the study of basic subjects and observation of general work within the maternity hospital. The second academic year focuses on lecturing on specialized subjects and various basic midwifery practices, such as outpatient clinics, delivery rooms, and home visits. The third academic year is devoted to various practical exercises and management practices. 4. In addition to being implemented within the school, the third academic year's internship may also be carried out in public or private maternal and infant health and medical institutions agreed upon by the school. When serving outside the school, the school should still be responsible for guidance, and the director of the service institution should be responsible for examining service performance. 5.

<p>— Original work by American author Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Nat went back to his beloved book, and his sister led the new guest to a room in the back, where they saw a strong man playing and having fun with two children on the sofa, and a thin woman finishing a letter and seeming to be rereading it. (Sofa is a common translation of "Sofa.")</p>
<p>"He's here, Auntie!" Mei shouted.</p>
<p>"This is my new little boy, isn't it? I'm happy to see you, my dear, and I hope you can have a good time here," the woman said, dragging him to her side and stroking his forehead with a motherly caress and expression, making Nat's lonely little heart feel an attachment to her.</p>
<p>Her appearance was not beautiful, but she had a cheerful face, and she always seemed to have some childlike attitude and spirit, and her voice and demeanor were the same. These things are difficult to describe, but easy to see and feel, making her a happy and amiable person, easy to get along with, and always joyful. As she straightened his hair, she saw Nat's little lips tremble slightly, and her sharp eyes showed a touch of pity and tenderness, but she pulled the poorly dressed person closer and smiled, saying:</p>
<p>"I am Mrs. Bei, that gentleman is Uncle Bei, and these two are Little Bei. Children, come and meet Nat."</p>
<p>The three people who were twisted together immediately obeyed: the strong man with a fat child on each shoulder came to welcome the new boy. Robert and Tandy only gave him a slight smile, but Mr. Bei came to shake his hand and pointed to a small stool near the fire, saying in a sincere tone:</p>
<p>"A seat has been prepared for you here, my son; sit down and dry your wet feet immediately."</p>
<p>"Wet? That's right! My dear, take off your shoes immediately, and I can prepare something dry for you," Mrs. Bei shouted, rushing back and forth with great enthusiasm. Before Nat could speak, he found himself comfortably in a comfortable chair, with dry socks and warm slippers on his feet. So he only said, "Thank you, Mrs. Teacher," saying it so sincerely that Mrs. Bei showed a kind expression again. He was an easily moved person, and at this point, he was deeply moved, so he tried to say something cheerful.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Review of When Foreign Rice First Entered China <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Yesterday (August 3rd), I accepted an invitation from the Chinese Youth Association to lecture on the problem of Chinese people's food. Before leaving, Mr. Yao asked me when foreign rice first entered China. This question is rather complicated and cannot be fully explained in a few words. I am happy to disclose this article for reference. Regarding the history of imported grains, my humble work has already appeared in the "History of Food Policy in China Throughout the Ages" (published by the Commercial Press). Recently, there have been two more articles: (1) "The Relationship Between Foreign Rice and Chinese People's Food" (see the July issue of New China Magazine, published by the China Book Bureau), (2) "The Exemption and Taxation of Foreign Rice" (see the July issue of Shen Bao Monthly, published by Shen Bao Newspaper Office). Combining these with this article, the details of the history of foreign rice are generally complete. In addition, the organization of imported flour and wheat has also been completed, and will be published later. Morning of the 4th.</p>
<p>When foreign rice first entered China, there is hardly any clear record in historical books before the Qing Dynasty. However, its entry into China certainly did not begin in the Qing Dynasty, which can be inferred. The so-called foreign rice producing areas today were either once part of our territory or our vassals. The relationship between them occurred thousands of years ago, so how could the import of grain have waited until the early Qing Dynasty to be realized? Therefore, based on the conditions of various rice-producing countries at that time, as recorded in historical books, and the changes in their relationship with our country, the question of when foreign rice first entered China may not be difficult to understand from this analysis.</p>
<p>The foreign rice that has the closest relationship with our country is the rice from Tokyo and Saigon, which are all produced in Annam. From the Qin and Han Dynasties to the Tang Dynasty, Annam was included in our territory. Until the early Song Dynasty, after the period of separatism of the Five Dynasties, it became independent from us. However, it still did not break away from its vassal relationship. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty, when it was annexed by France, that it became a foreign country to us. Tracing back to Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, who sent General Fubo, Lu Bode, to take the land of Nanyue and divide it into nine prefectures, the southernmost three prefectures—Jiaozhi, Jiuzhen, and Rinan—are the areas around present-day northern Annam (around Tokyo). According to the Book of Later Han:</p>
<p>"The Jiaozhi Prefecture of the Han Dynasty is 11,000 li south of Luoyang. The Jiuzhen Prefecture is 11,580 li south of Luoyang. The Rinan Prefecture is 13,400 li south of Luoyang."</p>
<p>The name "Rinan" was given because it was south of the sun, and the houses all faced north. The southernmost county of the five counties under its jurisdiction was "Xianglin." Xianglin was named because there were many elephants in the area (it was named Xiang Prefecture during the Qin Dynasty). In the second year of Yonghe of Emperor Shun of the Han Dynasty (137 AD), it was attacked and occupied by the outer barbarian Ou Lian and others, and it was called the Lin Yi Kingdom. Later, it became the territory of the countries of "Zhanbulao," "Champa," and "Old City," which roughly correspond to the central part of present-day Annam. Agriculture in Jiaozhi was already developed during the Han Dynasty, while Jiuzhen still lived a nomadic life, as can be seen in the biography of Ren Yan in the Book of Later Han. It is said: (Note)</p>
<p>"The custom of Jiuzhen is to make a living by hunting, and they do not know how to plow with oxen. The people often report to Jiaozhi for rice, which often leads to national shortages. Yan then ordered the casting of field tools and taught them to cultivate fields. Every year, they expanded the fields, and the people were well-supplied."</p>
<p>The soil in Rinan was also fertile, as the Book of Liang says: (Note 3)</p>
<p>"Lin Yi had no farmland at first. They coveted the fertile land of Rinan and often wanted to seize it. In the third year of Yonghe of Emperor Mu of Jin (347 AD), Xiahou Lan was the governor, and his oppression was even more severe. King Fan Wen of Lin Yi felt the resentment of the people and attacked Rinan with troops..."</p>
<p>The reason why Lin Yi wanted to seize Rinan was precisely because its land was fertile and suitable for cultivation.</p>
<p>The New History of the Yuan Dynasty (Note 4) also describes the morning agricultural conditions in Annam, saying:</p>
<p>"Its products are mostly rice and no wheat. It values sericulture and has silk cloth but does not grow cotton. Bamboo and trees form forests that block out the sun... The grass and trees do not wither in all four seasons, and there is no difference between day and night. What was called Rinan in ancient times is probably not false."</p>
<p>The History of the Ming Dynasty (Note 5) is even clearer, saying:</p>
<p>"Its territory borders the sea to the east, and across the sea to the south is Champa. To the north, it is connected to Siming and Nanning in Guangxi, and Lin'an and Yuanjiang in Yunnan. The soil is fertile, the climate is hot, and the grain harvest is abundant every year."</p>
<p>Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty once ordered King Chen Wei of Annam (Note 6) to supply military pay to Yunnan, which was to transport 5,000 shi to Lin'an. In the twenty-seventh year, when he was attacking Longzhou, he ordered Annam to transport 80,000 shi of rice to supply the Longzhou army. In the fifth year of Yongle, the army attacked and defeated Annam. The spoils of victory were abundant, including 13.6 million shi of rice. If Annam was not abundant in products, how could it have repeatedly supplied the army, and accumulated such a large amount? As for its transportation into China, according to the History of the Song Dynasty:</p>
<p>"In the third year of Xiangfu, King Li Longting of Jiaozhi requested mutual trade in Yongzhou. The emperor said, 'The people on the coast often suffer from the invasion of Jiaozhou. We still only allow Gengzhou and Ru Hongzhai to help each other, as a place to control the border. Now, if they go directly to the interior, it is quite inconvenient.'"</p>
<p>When Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty ordered the supply of rice to the Longzhou army, Annam, because of the dangerous land route, requested to transport it to Kongxiang Cave, and then ordered to transport 20,000 shi to the Jiang River along the coast, which was only half a day away from Longzhou. It can be seen that at that time, sea transportation between China and Vietnam was convenient. The two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, which lacked rice the most, were both coastal and had early trade with the South. Therefore, the import of Annam rice was possible.</p>
<p>It is said that the origin of indica rice is the Champa rice that was obtained from Fujian in the fourth year of Dazhong Xiangfu of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty (1011 AD). Therefore, the rice that existed in China was called japonica, and the rice that came from Champa was called indica in the Yangtze River basin, and sticky rice by the people of Min and Yue, because it came from Champa. However, according to Yang Xiong's dialect, "people in Jiangnan call japonica 'you,'" so japonica and indica were originally the same thing. Regardless of whether this statement is reliable or not, judging from the History of the Song Dynasty, it first says:</p>
<p>"Speakers said: The people of Jiangbei plant various grains, while Jiangnan specializes in planting japonica rice. Although the local customs are suitable for different crops, the ancient system also includes interplanting to prevent floods and droughts. Therefore, the emperor ordered the chief officials of Jiangnan, Liangzhe, Jinghu, Lingnan, and Fujian to encourage the people to plant more grains. For those who lack seeds of millet, wheat, sorghum, and beans, they should be provided by the prefectures and counties in Huaibei. The prefectures in Jiangnan should also plant japonica rice widely near the water and exempt them from rent."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the planting of japonica rice in Jiangnan continues to this day and has not changed slightly. However, the area where indica rice is now planted is far greater than the area where japonica rice is planted. In all the rice-producing provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and the Yangtze River, the majority of rice production is indica rice. Therefore, if it is said that the import of indica seeds began in the time of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty, then what was planted in the thousands of years before Emperor Zhenzong was mostly japonica rice? If so, why would they abandon japonica rice and change to planting indica rice once Champa rice was imported? If the transferring power of Champa rice is so great, why does Jiangnan still retain its habit of "specializing in planting japonica rice" and not be assimilated? This cannot be understood by reasoning, and it is difficult to understand by facts. Furthermore, the Champa rice obtained by Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty from Fujian was clearly a type of early rice. The history says: "Jianghuai and Liangzhe are slightly earlier. Even if the paddy fields do not yield a good harvest, 30,000 hu of Champa rice should be obtained and distributed to the three regions for planting. Select the people's high and dry fields to plant it, because it is early rice." It also says: "It grows without selecting the land." It can be seen that it is also dry rice. The rice cultivation in Annam, from the season, includes early rice and late rice. From the nature, there are so-called paddy rice and dry rice. However, Annamese people also mostly plant late rice, and early rice is less. Paddy rice is more, and dry rice is less. Early rice is sown in November and harvested in March of the following year, which is the dry season, so the rainfall is less and the harvest is thin. Dry rice is also the same. This is why more paddy rice and late rice are planted. Therefore, after the import of Champa rice into China, who knows that it was also abandoned by the farmers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang because the harvest was thin? Or the current early rice, which is harvested twice a year, is still credible. However, the sticky rice in Lingnan may have come from Champa, but it cannot be said that it is all Champa seeds. The communication between Champa and China was in the years of Xian De in the Zhou Dynasty, which was later. Before that, the two Yue provinces already had rice, as can be inferred from Ren Yan teaching the people of Jiuzhen to plant rice. However, the two Yue provinces and Vietnam are adjacent, and the exchange of rice seeds is actually possible. If it is said that Champa rice seeds are easy to change, and that the current indica rice is a variant of Champa rice, it is far-fetched. Moreover, there is another proof that makes the debate about "indica" and "sticky" lose its value, which is the agricultural products of the Champa Kingdom recorded in the History of the Song Dynasty:</p>
<p>(The Champa Kingdom...has no wheat, but has japonica rice, sago rice, beans, and sesame seeds.)</p>
<p>The history says that the rice of Champa is not called "indica" or "sticky," but "japonica." It can be seen that "you" and "sticky" are both local dialects of Jiangnan and Minyue. From this, it can be seen that China is not without indica rice, but the books do not record it because indica rice is a type of japonica rice, so it is not necessary to specifically mention it. Therefore, it is called Champa rice, not Champa indica rice. Rice is the general term for grains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Champa, according to historical books, did not produce rice at first. Judging from the current topography, it is not a major rice-producing area. After the Lin Yi Kingdom was defeated by Zhang Dan of the Tang Dynasty, it moved to Champa and was called the Champa Kingdom. It has been said before that Lin Yi had no farmland. Champa has few plains and lives in the coastal mountains, making a living by maritime affairs, often seeking what it lacks from foreign countries, plundering sea boats (such as in the third year of Qian Dao of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty, when it seized the goods of the people of the Great Food Kingdom and paid tribute to the Song Dynasty), or invading Annam to the north and attacking Cambodia to the south. (Note 7) Therefore, the History of the Song Dynasty uniquely recorded the sea route between Champa and China in detail, which can be a clear proof of the frequent maritime exchanges between the Song Dynasty and Champa. It says:</p>
<p>"The Champa Kingdom is in the southwest of China, east to the sea...north to Guangzhou takes half a month by wind, northeast to Liangzhe takes a month, northwest to Jiaozhou takes two days, and half a month by land."</p>
<p>Jiaozhi is adjacent to Champa, but it takes half a month by land, and only two days by sea, which shows the inconvenience of land transportation between the two places. Therefore, when King Li Huan of Jiaozhi wanted to attack Champa in the sixth year of Taiping Xingguo of Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty, he also built a new seaport to facilitate navigation because the mountain roads were dangerous. It is clear that Champa faces the sea and has communication and exchanges that cannot follow the land but must follow the sea. However, because it makes a living by maritime affairs, it often trades with overseas countries, so heavy goods such as rice can also be transferred by sea for convenience. Moreover, the products of all mountains and coastal areas are always insufficient to supply their livelihood, so they often seek what they lack from overseas. In the past, King Si of Lin Yi coveted the fertile land of Rinan and wanted to possess it. Champa often fought with Jiaozhi and Chenla, all for the sake of survival. It is therefore impossible to say that Champa's rice production is more than enough for self-sufficiency and can also supply others. The History of the Ming Dynasty says: (Note 8)</p>
<p>"The country (Champa) has no frost or snow, and all four seasons are like summer. The grass and trees are always green. The people make a living by fishing. There is no wheat, and few people work in the fields, so the harvest is thin. The people of the country all eat betel nuts and never leave their mouths all day."</p>
<p>It also says: (Note 9)</p>
<p>"During the Chenghua period of the Ming Dynasty, King Li Hao of Annam was ordered to return the land of Champa. Hao said: 'Champa is not fertile, and families have little savings, and there is no mulberry or hemp in the fields.'" From this, it can be known that the life of the Champa people is navigation and fishing, and that "the land is not fertile, and families have little savings." It can be seen that they are not a people who work hard in farming and harvesting. How can they have a large amount of rice to export overseas? Therefore, the Champa rice mentioned in the History of the Song Dynasty should be produced by Champa and transported by the Champa people (or products of Chenla). It is clear that the people of the Song Dynasty did not understand and thought it was Champa rice.</p>
<p>Chenla is now the southern part of Annam, a rice-producing area. The Book of Sui says: (Note 10)</p>
<p>"The Chenla Kingdom is southwest of Zhenyi, originally a subordinate country of Funan. It is sixty days by boat from the Rinan Prefecture... The country is mostly mountainous to the north and has water to the south. The climate is particularly hot and there is no frost or snow. The soil is suitable for sorghum and rice, and there is little millet, fruit, and vegetables, similar to Rinan and Jiuzhen."</p>
<p>Historians do not compare Champa with it, which shows that Champa does not engage in farming. The Book of Tang also says: (Note 11)</p>
<p>"The Chenla Kingdom was originally a subordinate country of Funan... Southern people call the Chenla Kingdom the Khmer Kingdom. After Shenlong, Chenla was divided into two. The southern part is close to the sea and has many slopes and swamps, called Water Chenla (i.e., southern part), and the northern part is mostly mountainous, called Land Chenla (i.e., Cambodia)."</p>
<p>It is also called "Rich Chenla" because its sea has pearls and treasures, and its mountains have gold, jade, and fragrant wood. However, Champa and Chenla often fought with each other. In the early years of Shaoxi of Emperor Guangzong of the Song Dynasty (Note 12), Champa was once destroyed by Chenla, so it was also called Zhanla. After that, the two countries were constantly at war until the end of the Ming Dynasty. The History of the Ming Dynasty records the rice cultivation situation in Chenla (Note 13):</p>
<p>"Chenla is south of Champa, and it takes three days and nights by favorable wind to reach it... The weather is always hot, and there is no frost or snow. The rice is harvested several times a year."</p>
<p>The exchanges between Annam, Champa, Chenla, and China were prosperous in the Song Dynasty. During the Song Dynasty, the food of the people in the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong relied on Annam rice for supply, such as the 30,000 shi of Champa rice obtained from Fujian during the Xiangfu period, which is clear evidence. By the Ming Dynasty, foreign rice was imported to avoid taxes, and southern merchant ships mostly carried rice instead of goods. (Note 15) However, if we want to trace the original source of foreign rice, we should still trace back to when China first communicated with the southern countries by sea. According to the Book of Jin:</p>
<p>"At first, the various countries outside the border (Note 16) traded goods from overseas. The governor of Jiaozhou and the governor of Rinan coveted profits and insulted them, reducing the price by two or three tenths."</p>
<p>In times of inconvenient transportation, they could only choose to trade in precious and portable items. When shipping was open and ships could carry goods, both large and small could be transferred. The Book of Liang says:</p>
<p>"Since the revolution of the Liang Dynasty, the overseas countries have paid tribute, and their voyages to the sea have exceeded those of previous generations."</p>
<p>At that time, maritime transport between China and other countries was prosperous. After the development of the Tang Dynasty, its prestige reached far and wide, and southern countries all called Chinese people "Tang people." (Note 17) Moreover, the kings of various Funan countries (i.e., present-day Siam) built large ships and traveled the sea during the transition between the Wu and Jin Dynasties in China. They repeatedly paid tribute during the Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, which is sufficient evidence that they had trade and mutual trade with China. Although the ancient people's ban on communication with foreign countries was very strict, it was not prohibited if it was a tribute-paying country. (Note 18) Since the Song Dynasty, mutual trade has gradually become more prosperous. All the large ports along the coast of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangnan established customs offices to levy taxes. Overseas mutual trade has become commonplace, and foreign rice, if needed, will also be imported accordingly (some say that the import of rice is not seen in history. This is precisely because it was neglected by historians at that time. Ivory, agarwood, gold, silver, and jewels were regarded as treasures, and they were all written about in great detail. However, "rice," which is related to the people's food, was regarded as a common food and was not taken seriously by the people of the time. There is no documentary evidence, which may be the reason for this. Furthermore, the rice produced in the prefectures of Jiaozhi was regarded as our country's product before the Song Dynasty, and the old history mostly lacked records of people's livelihood and economy. This is not only true for rice. If there is transfer and supply, there is originally no need to write about it in detail, so it can only be deduced from the text.</p>
<p>Annam rice entered China early and is still a major source of imported rice in China. In addition to Annam rice, Siam rice can be matched with it. Siam is mentioned in our country's history in the Book of Jin, which says:</p>
<p>"Funan is more than 3,000 li west of Lin Yi, and it is engaged in farming. It is planted once a year and harvested three times a year."</p>
<p>The Book of Sui says:</p>
<p>"The Red Earth Kingdom is a separate species of Funan... It is warm in winter and summer, with more rain and less drought. There is no time for planting, and it is especially suitable for rice, sorghum, white beans, and black sesame."</p>
<p>The New History of the Yuan Dynasty says:</p>
<p>"Siam and Luohu are the ancient Funan countries... Luohu is south of Siam, bordering the sea. The soil of Siam is barren and not suitable for farming. The land of Luohu is flat, and the planting is abundant. The Siamese rely on it for supply. There is a big river, which reaches the sea in the southeast of Luohu from Siam. Every summer, there is yellow water, which rises into the inland river from the seaport. The farmers take the opportunity to row boats and sow seeds. The seedlings gradually rise with the water, and the seedlings also rise with the water. When the water recedes, the seedlings are ripe. There is sowing and planting, but no plowing, so the grain is abundant and cheap."</p>
<p>This is the reason why the grain in Siam is cheap. The History of the Ming Dynasty says:</p>
<p>"The Kingdom of Siam is southwest of Champa, and it takes ten days and nights by favorable wind to reach it. It is the Red Earth Kingdom of the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Later, it was divided into Luohu and Siam. The soil of Siam is barren and not suitable for farming, and Luohu has abundant land and abundant harvests. Siam relies on it for supply. During the Yuan Dynasty, Luohu was strong and annexed its land, so it was called the Siam Luohu Kingdom. In the tenth year of Hongwu, the prince came to court and was given a cast seal, with the inscription 'Seal of the King of Siam.' The country's capitals and decrees began to be called Siam."</p>
<p>During the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, Siam paid tribute, and it was heard that the price was low, so it was ordered to transport it to Guangdong and Fujian for sale, exempting it from taxes. (Note 19) Since then, the import of Siam rice has become increasingly important. It and Annam have become a powerful supply for the food of the Chinese people, and it is also China's largest loophole.</p>
<p>The Book of Tang also records that there are rice-producing countries in the south:</p>
<p>"The Dongxie Barbarians are located hundreds of miles west of Qianzhou, south of Shou Gong Liao, west of Yizi, and north of the Barbarians. The soil is suitable for five grains, and they do not use middle farming. However, before the sky is dark, they change every year."</p>
<p>"The Boliyi Kingdom is in the southeastern sea of Lin Yi... The climate is hot and humid, always like the height of summer in China, and the grain ripens twice a year."</p>
<p>In addition, paper towels are still a supply for the food of the people in Fujian Province, which is Taiwan. Before Taiwan was ceded to Japan, it often supplied rice to the mainland. Since it was ceded to Japan, it has also been imported. As for the origin of its rice cultivation, the History of the Ming Dynasty says: (Note 20)</p>
<p>"Mount Jilong has green grass every year. The soil is suitable for five grains, but it is not good for paddy fields. When the grain seeds fall to the ground, they will kill them. It is said that doing good deeds helps the heavens and asks for food. After the harvest, they mark bamboo poles on the road, called inserting green. At this time, they will kill foreigners... At the end of the Wanli period, Red-haired barbarians docked their boats here and engaged in cultivation and digging due to an incident. They set up a group and called it Taiwan."</p>
<p>After our Chinese people developed the wilderness and worked hard to manage it, rice became the largest product of Taiwan, and now it is no longer ours.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Finance: The weekly foreign exchange rate remains the same—Guangjiao rises slightly—Copper coins are shortened— <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and most banks were closed for the day, so the market situation was extremely quiet. The foreign exchange market remained unchanged. The morning and afternoon rates were both two corners, the same as before. The early market exchange of drafts was over 2.8 million, the new exchange was over 330,000, the exchange in the small group meeting was over 500,000. The exchange of foreign currency mortgages was over 660,000, and the new transaction was over 770,000. There was no change in the banknote exchange. Only 550,000 in unmarked coupons were issued. The foreign public bills received by the money shops were over 3.1 million, the remittances from various routes were over 330,000, and the sources from the passenger routes were 200,000. There was no news of any expenditure. As for the bank's receipts and disbursements, because of the holiday, it was closed for a day, so it was temporarily stopped, and there was no news to report. Yesterday, the Jiangnan small foreign exchange had no transaction all day, so it was still listed at the previous market price of 836 yuan, with no change. The Guangdong small foreign exchange rose by one yuan and three corners in the early market, at 736 yuan and two corners. The afternoon market had few transactions, resulting in a drop of six corners, so the result was only seven corners higher than the previous market. The early market trade was 95,000 yuan, and the afternoon market was 15,000 yuan. The copper coins have been changed to 342,000 yuan, which is 1,500 yuan less than the previous market. The transaction amount was 30,780 strings of coins, totaling 9,000 yuan.</p>

<p>From July 29th to August 3rd of last week, the China Merchants Securities Exchange was the beginning of the September futures after the delivery of the July futures. Because the banks were in the strong position of the big buyers, the July futures were squeezed, and the August futures shorts gradually increased. The market chips gradually became tight, and the shorts were hit hard. The market price soared, and the previous types reached the recent peak in the last two months. Then, No. 48 long suddenly came out, and the passenger banks sold along with it. The wind fell sharply, and the people's hearts and backs were almost led by No. 48. However, No. 48 soon stopped selling and even made further purchases, and the market price had the appearance of revival. This is the general situation of the past week. Looking at the trend of public debt, the Italian and Austrian dispute seems to have turned around. The cooperation between China and Japan is becoming increasingly close. The flood situation is not expected to expand. The government is preparing meticulously for financial problems. Although the local finance has not yet been sound, the escape of capital is enough to increase the urgent need for public debt. Based on this speculation, the abnormal development of the bond market is in full swing. Depending on the supply and demand of chips, the financial community has become wary of the successive bankruptcies of Xiaoyin banks and money shops. Most of the inventories have been sold late. The future financial problems are slightly stable. If there is no slight change in the environment, the goods that the financial community has already spit out will inevitably be recovered. Moreover, the cash part of the paper money reserve has also been reduced to 40%. Once implemented, the public debt demand will inevitably feel the exhaustion of chips again. The future may have considerable progress and a promising future. Wait and see. Monday of last week was the delivery date for July futures, with no market. The September futures started on Tuesday, and the atmosphere in the market was tense. It was predicted that there would still be a rise. After the opening, the reorganization and reduction of troops rose sharply by about one or two yuan, and there was almost a high rise and suspension. Then, the wind fell as soon as No. 21 and other northern gangs drained out. The second session even returned to a small one yuan and two corners, and the speed of the reversal and the amount of the difference made people fall into a fog again. Because of the relationship between currency inflation, the banks have different opinions and have obvious differences, so there is a tendency to go to extremes. On Wednesday, the big buyer No. 48 suddenly spit out a lot, and the market price plummeted from several corners to one yuan and seven or eight corners. On Thursday, because No. 48 stopped selling, the market price recovered from fatigue, and it was slightly dazed. The gains and losses were different. On Friday, it turned stable again and rose several corners. After No. 96 pressed down a little on the 4th, it returned to its peak. On Saturday, it continued to rise, and although the trend was not strong, it had the appearance of stepping up the ranks and rising by about half a yuan. The situation was strong. In summary, the result of the market price fell by one or two corners to more than one yuan. The total number of transactions was 85,522,100 yuan. The result of its rise and fall is compared and listed on the left. (Unit: Yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with fluctuating conditions. Prices for all months fell by one or two points. Subsequently, due to long positions closing, foreign firms selling, and hedging activities, prices continued to soften. Later, brokers bought December contracts and short positions covered, resulting in a rebound and market confusion. The spot market is currently stagnant, with few deliveries. The textile market is relatively better. Before the close, due to private estimates of increased supply, long positions were closed, leading to another decline, but the close was steady. Spot prices fell by five points, nearby months by three to five points, and distant months rose by one to three points. British cotton trading was suspended. Indian cotton initially weakened due to long positions closing and futures traders selling, but later recovered due to short covering. Broach cotton fell by one rupee, Oomra cotton by 0.75 rupees, and Bengal cotton by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees, according to telegraphic reports. (Third day telegram)</p>
<p>Broach 136.75 down 1.00 19.90</p>

<h3 id="e186">Sugar Market: Detailed Registration of Shantou Native Sugar <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>At the end of last month, all Chaoshan sugar in Shantou suddenly received an order from the Guangdong Provincial Materials Management Office to send personnel to establish a branch office in Shantou to register native sugar and stop allocation, with the intention of establishing a public monopoly. Upon hearing this news, Chaoshan sugar merchants sent representatives to petition the Native Sugar Association to request the Shantou branch office to cancel this plan. The association forwarded the request, but the Shantou branch office replied that the registration of native sugar was being carried out under provincial orders, and the request for cancellation could not be approved. Later, the branch office relayed an instruction from the provincial office stating that the registration deadline for sugar stocks in all districts would be extended to the end of August, and that personnel would be sent to purchase the sugar. Upon hearing this, sugar merchants and producers were even more alarmed. The Native Sugar Association sent a formal letter to the Shantou branch office, again requesting a swift cancellation and requesting a suspension of registration until the matter was resolved (original text omitted). The main points were to request respect for private enterprise, to refrain from implementing a blockade policy, and to maintain a lifeline for Chaoshan sugar. Furthermore, the suspension of transportation and purchase would be a fatal blow to Chaozhou and Meizhou. They earnestly requested consideration of public sentiment and a referral of the request for cancellation to alleviate the distress of the people. It is estimated that Shantou has over 10,000 bags of sugar, aside from the 10,000 plus bags that have been shipped out. It is still difficult to predict whether the remaining sugar can be transported. It is reported that the Shantou Native Sugar Association and various sugar industry groups in Chaozhou, together representing millions of people in Chaozhou and Meizhou, are actively opposing this measure with the goal of achieving its cancellation.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Red and White Sugar Prices Rising Sharply <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since stepping into the ascending phase, the sugar market has seen a marked improvement in sentiment, with the uptrend continuing. The association’s market price for existing spot of No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar is seventeen yuan and one dime, with one hundred bags traded, an increase of one dime and a half. Re-export goods were offered at a higher price of one dime, for a total of five yuan and two dimes, but no trades occurred. Cotton white sugar from this factory, Zhenyu No. 1, was sixteen yuan and two dimes, an increase of three dimes, while No. 234 remained unchanged. The factory's white crystal sugar was offered at twenty yuan and two dimes, but no trades occurred. On the market board, the Xinghua gang offered two hundred and several tens bags of Gaozhuang Xing red sugar at a price of twelve yuan, an increase of six to seven dimes. The Chaozhou gang offered over two hundred bags of ordinary cotton red sugar at eleven yuan and seven to five dimes, with slightly lower prices for inferior grades. In addition, several tens of bags of Zhiyang sugar were offered at twelve yuan and four dimes. Dong White sugar also rose by four to five dimes, with "口" mark at seventeen yuan and a half, and "N" mark at seventeen yuan and three dimes. High-quality Dong Red sugar was offered at thirteen yuan, and ordinary grade at twelve yuan and nine dimes, an increase of one dime.</p>

<h3 id="e189">The Writer's Style and Their Personality <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jicong</p>
<p>Generally speaking, not only do the styles of writers from different eras and schools differ in essence, but even writers from the same era and school have some degree of difference in their respective styles. In fact, Corneille and Molière were playwrights of the same era of French classicism, but one cannot say that their styles are exactly the same; Byron, Shelley, and Keats were all English Romantics of the same era, but their works each had their own characteristics; Tolstoy and Dostoevsky were also world-renowned Russian literary giants of the nineteenth century, and both can be said to be realists, but when describing characters, the former "starts from the description of the development of the protagonist's character and moves to Drama," while the latter "starts from Drama and moves to the development of the character preparing for Drama," thus showing the great difference in their styles... To explain the different styles of these writers, individualists generally seek it in the unique personality of each writer. According to them, each writer has his own unique personality, and because the personalities of the writers are different, their respective styles are also different; to understand the unique style of each writer and even the entire content and form of their works, in their opinion, the most important thing is to make an effort to study the writer's private life and his unique personality; everything else is irrelevant.</p>
<p>It is true that every writer must have his own unique personality, and that this unique personality is closely related to his style; but we cannot therefore say that the writer's style is determined by his unique personality, and of course we should not explain his unique style by his unique personality. The fact that the styles of the aforementioned writers differ considerably may find some superficial explanations in their respective personalities, but we cannot explain their entire style from their unique personalities. Because every writer lives in the real society to which he belongs, enjoys the material of that society, sees and hears the things of that society, and thinks about the problems of that society, so his thoughts, his creative talent, and the content of his works are all determined by the society in which he lives; as for his style, it is directly determined by the content expressed in his works, and indirectly determined by his life consciousness and the spirit of the times. Take the aforementioned writers as examples. Because Corneille and Molière both lived in France during the era of absolutism, were influenced by the same spirit of the times, and were subject to almost the same environmental domination, their styles were fundamentally the same: the style of classicism; although under this fundamental similarity, their respective styles also have some slight differences, but this difference exists in the fundamentally same style, and is constituted by the slight differences in the things they encountered and the knowledge they gained in their respective lives; the so-called unique personality cannot play an independent role here, and if we were to say that personality plays a role here, it is subordinate to the role of society. The similarities and differences in the styles of Byron and others can also be explained by the same principle. As for the difference between Dostoevsky's method of describing characters and that of Tolstoy and his contemporaries, we can even say that this is combined with the ideological content of opposing aristocratic society and opposing tradition that runs through his works; he made the following confession in his "A Weak Heart": "It is necessary to explain and describe the status, occupation, and especially the character of the characters who appear, but because many writers start writing in this way, because the novelist narrated here does not want to follow their footsteps, he is determined to start writing only from a person's current behavior." "Unwilling to follow in the footsteps of others" is a manifestation of anti-traditional thought. If someone wants to use Dostoevsky's unique personality to explain his unique style, it would probably be in vain. Everyone knows that Dostoevsky's most unique personality is gambling and being jealous, but what is the relationship between this and his descriptive method of "starting from a person's current behavior"? No relationship at all!</p>
<p>Those individualists who explain a writer's style by their personality are most happy to talk about Balzac. Because Balzac has a peculiar appearance and personality; his body is fat, his face is ugly, his temperament is wild, rough, and fickle; at the same time, he describes things very directly, and he often uses what people consider to be "vulgar" and "spicy" writing to express reality; therefore, general individualistic literary researchers have not hesitated to draw such a conclusion: Balzac's "vulgar" and "simple" style, his "rough" and "spicy" flavor, are completely determined by his wild and rough personality. But, in my opinion, what is most unfavorable to individualistic literary researchers is probably Balzac.</p>
<p>Indeed, Balzac in all his works, likes to use what people consider to be "offensive," "vulgar" words and "spicy" satirical language. Henry James once said that Balzac's pen was "rough, violent, and barbaric," and that his style was "the simplest." If viewed purely from the form, these comments may not be unreasonable. However, the so-called "vulgar" words and "spicy" satirical language, the so-called "rough, violent, and barbaric" writing styles, are not empty things, but express certain thoughts and feelings; Balzac's fondness for using "vulgar" words and "spicy" satirical language, for using "rough, violent, and barbaric" writing styles, is because he is a pioneer of realism, and he has to expose the true face of reality and show the ugliness of society, and he has to use such words and writing styles. Therefore, we say that Balzac's fondness for using such words and writing styles is determined by his social thought and his realistic creative principles. His rough and wild personality does not have a unique and significant meaning here. If we do not believe this, then we must ask: Flaubert and Zola's styles can be said to be somewhat similar to Balzac's, and "Madame Bovary" (Flaubert) and "Les Rougon-Macquart" (Zola) can even be said to have been greatly influenced by Balzac's "The Human Comedy"; in describing reality, they also wrote with sincere pens like Balzac. Therefore, in the eyes of general moralists, Zola's works are not only "vulgar" but also indecent, and even believe that families with girls should not keep his works; if Balzac's style is determined by his personality, then Flaubert and Zola, whose styles are so similar to his, should have personalities similar to his, but Flaubert's personality is reclusive, and he is not wild and rough, and Zola does not have a wild and rough personality either. He is very laborious and meticulously strives for creation -- how should this contradiction be resolved? Literary researchers who use personality to explain the writer's style, if they cannot resolve this contradiction, then their theory is shown to be of little use.</p>
<p>In short, the writer's style is determined by the ideological content of his works, by his life experience, and by the spirit of the times that he feels. His personality plays a secondary role here, so to understand the writer's style, one can only study his works from a social point of view. His personality and private life are only supplementary reference materials in this study. "Li Bai composes a hundred poems after a jug of wine," when studying Li Bai's style, knowing that his fondness for alcohol is helpful, but that alone is not enough, because we cannot say that Li Bai's poems are made of wine, nor can we use his fondness for alcohol to explain his style; only by examining the social consciousness expressed in his poems and his entire creative method can we fundamentally understand the problem. The study of the styles of all other writers must also be done in this way.</p>

<p>— Ivan</p>
<p>"Have another drink! Have another drink! Old Brother, it’s both your thirtieth birthday and your son's first birthday! A double celebration! Be quick, have another drink!"</p>
<p>"Old Wei, how can I compete with your capacity? Let’s just leave it at that."</p>
<p>The guest, his face shining with grease, was holding a large glass of wine, waiting for the host to clink glasses. He had already clinked glasses twice, and now he was forcing him to clink a third time. The host was bitterly apologizing, almost begging for mercy. But that experienced guest suddenly pulled a sly face:</p>
<p>"Old Sun, are you really not giving me face?"</p>
<p>Old Sun bitterly drank that harsh wine. The guest, seeing that his glass was empty, gulped down his own wine in one go, threw his glass back, and returned to his seat, laughing heartily.</p>
<p>Old Sun felt dizzy and only wanted to lie down and have a long sleep, but in order to maintain the lively atmosphere, he had no choice but to force a smile, desperately pouring drinks for others, and helplessly swallowing the drinks that others poured for him.</p>
<p>The wine flowed like a yellow river, ceaselessly, between the wine pot and the glasses. Dishes were served one after another, only to be quickly eaten, and hot air rose like a thin layer of mist. The lights shone dazzlingly. The electric fan swept around energetically. But everyone still had to sweat. While sweating, they had to curse and quarrel, offer toasts, and remember to pick up food and put it in their mouths. Both host and guests had to muster their spirits to eat, drink, talk, and laugh along with others.</p>
<p>After seeing off the guests, the host, Old Sun, held his aching head while counting the money. The Shaoxing wine alone cost six yuan and fifty cents. Touching his aching head, he sighed inwardly and felt wronged.</p>
<p>The next day was Sunday. Old Sun woke up from his nap, yawned dully, and his wife waited for him to finish yawning before slowly asking:</p>
<p>"Will you come out with me for a while?"</p>
<p>"I don't have time."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I have engagements tonight."</p>
<p>"Engagements again! Baby is covered in mosquito bites. If we don't do something, he might develop an illness. I wanted to go and buy him a mosquito net. If you're busy with engagements, I'll just go by myself."</p>
<p>"Where will you get the extra money?"</p>
<p>"There’s a cheap advertisement in the newspaper for only five yuan."</p>
<p>Old Sun, whose headache hadn't completely gone away, was already in a bad mood when he woke up. Hearing that his wife wanted to buy this and that, he roared:</p>
<p>"Five yuan! There's only five yuan left in the drawer. There's still a week until the end of the month. Go buy it! Go buy it! Shut up the mouths of the whole family!"</p>
<p>Having vented his anger, he put on his long gown and went out to his "engagements," taking advantage of the energy brought on by his outburst of temper.</p>
<p>His wife wiped away her tears, resenting the man's unpredictable temper. Raising her head, she saw a pile of silver shields, flower baskets, mirror frames, and scrolls on the table, all gifts from the previous day, emanating an air of wealth and extravagance. Her eyes then swept to the baby's cradle next to it. The baby was sleeping soundly, his face and body covered in red spots. Thinking of the mosquito net, the mother felt heartbroken. Filled with resentment, she ran over and pushed all those red, green, and shiny things onto the floor with force, making a loud crash that startled the baby in the cradle, who started crying loudly.</p>
<h3 id="e191">A Corner of the Taihang Mountains (Part Two) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>The small mountains are planted with cypress and thorny pine, damp and cold, with a faint pine fragrance in the gentle breeze. The town stretches out eastward from the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>The town is home to three or five hundred households, quite prosperous. Just take a walk through the streets and alleys and you will see many tall walls and buildings. But when you climb to a high place and look around, you can't help but be taken aback.</p>
<p>At the end of the town, a wisp of green smoke rises, one strand soaring into the clear sky, the other turning into wisps, carried by the breeze into the wilderness, and eventually dissipating. And in another corner, the tall building reveals its original form. The roof is gone, and the charred ruins stand tall under the blue sky. The sun shines through the terribly large window openings, so empty and lifeless, like Europe after a Mongol raid.</p>
<p>It turns out that this place has suffered two major disasters in the past five or six years, very unlucky. Initially, there was a "feudal collective" association called the "Heavenly Gate Society," with an emperor, empress, military advisors, generals, civil and military officials, and no shortage of soldiers and land. Their methods were, of course, not very civilized. According to old Chinese tradition, when one declares himself emperor, one must kill millions. Once they ascended to the throne, those who defied "Heaven's mandate" had to be killed. This kingdom had a remarkable law: every commoner must have a gun, except for women, the old, and the weak. All able-bodied men were drafted into the imperial army. They also had a conscription system. This was a great disaster for tenant farmers and poor farmers, who could not afford guns and had to be killed. However, the most unfortunate were the vagrants who neither "defied Heaven's mandate" nor submitted "letters of recommendation" because the royal law also stipulated: those who do not engage in proper occupations shall be killed without question. This was a truly brilliant method for eliminating consumers and alleviating unemployment.</p>
<p>These unusually lively days lasted for about two years. There was constant mobilization of troops and dispatching of generals. Eventually, the emperor fled, and the imperial family and their retainers also slipped away. As soon as the army arrived, it recovered the lost territory, and the fire burned bright.</p>
<p>Not long after, the situation stabilized, and the lieutenants returned home to clean up the mess and resume their roles as landlords. The people were also preparing to live and work in peace, but unexpectedly, residents from the eastern mountains were captured, inevitably leading to more killings and another fire. However, the residents of the western mountains were not "benevolent" either, and immediately launched a large-scale counterattack, invading the eastern mountains, killing people, and setting fires again. They not only took back their own belongings, but also carried away everything else. As a result, the surrounding area of hundreds of miles was "reduced to ashes." At that time, it would have been very appropriate to use "broken bricks and tiles, barren land for thousands of miles" in telegrams.</p>
<p>Now it is very peaceful. Idlers have long been slaughtered clean. Those who followed were helping the "Heroin" company directly or indirectly, and the farmers were still fighting stones on the top of the mountain. Young masters teased the women of tenant farmers, smoked "Old Hai" (heroin), and played cards. As for the masters who had served as royal generals, they were said to be playing with "maids" all day long while smoking opium.</p>
<p>I wonder if such a world can be compared to medieval Europe... I remember seeing a painting somewhere: a kneeling woman, her hair draped over her back, her hands stretched upwards, her eyes wide open, looking up at the sky in pain...</p>
<p>The painting immediately merged with the scenery in front of me.</p>

<p>— Written by Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>Just as he was looking at the menu, she sat down beside him; soon the waiter brought several plates of dishes and a bottle of champagne, and placed them in front of the two. The cork was carefully removed "Count" had never allowed champagne corks to pop; the sparkling wine flowed into the glass. The other girls’ dishes and drinks were very simple; they secretly nudged their male companions with their elbows; my attention was also completely focused on this couple. Nali held her pale face in one hand, and her other hand lay forgotten beneath a full glass of wine; "Count" was contentedly busy eating his roast sparrow and silently drinking the champagne.</p>
<p>"Aren't you eating, Nali?" he finally asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>He stared at her for a while. "You don't eat, that's fine," he continued quietly, "that's up to you!" Then he poured wine for himself and continued to eat his supper.</p>
<p>The girl picked up the glass and put it to her lips, as if she was very thirsty, and drank it all in one gulp. Her head was still lazily propped on her hand, and she didn't lift it up. She picked up the wine bottle and poured it towards the empty glass in mid-air; the wine flowed out slowly, gradually creating foam at the bottom of the glass. Her eyes looked at the wine with a disappointed expression, as if watching her life flowing out of the bottle. She simply didn't care that the wine foam flowed from the mouth of the glass to the tabletop and from the tabletop to the ground, only her other hand was still tightly holding her silky black hair.</p>
<p>"Beauty," a young student with a nascent beard stretched his empty glass towards her in a begging manner, and said in a low voice, "Please pour some of your leftover wine for me to drink!"</p>
<p>Nali didn't lift her head, but I saw the corner of her mouth twitch rapidly.</p>
<p>"What are you doing, "junior", what do you want?" an old student asked, who had been busy drinking all along; "Oh, haha, such a waste of good things!" he suddenly shouted, and grabbed the girl's arm.</p>
<p>"Count" only moved to the side a little, as the champagne flowed past him to the ground. "Let her be," he said, "her nature is like this. Isn't it, Nali?" he added, smiling at her, "Both of us are wasteful!"</p>
<p>She put the bottle on the table and gave him a resentful look for no reason. Then she stood up and walked towards the door leading to the hall. But he also jumped up and followed her. A barely suppressed anger was expressed on his handsome and neat face. "What are you doing!" he said in a low voice, and roughly grabbed her arm. She stopped, didn't shake off his hand, only glared at him with scorn in her shining black eyes. He held her for a while, then withdrew his hand, laughed, and sat back at the table, slowly pouring the remaining wine in the bottle into the glass. ——I saw Nali disappear through the door of the hall, among the dancing people.</p>
<p>My blood was boiling; I had seen everything in the place where I was. After a while, I left the friends I was talking to and went to the hall to wait for her.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Medical Professionals' Assistance in the Anti-Smoking Campaign <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang took office as the Anti-Smoking Supervisor-General, the anti-smoking policies have indeed been implemented with vigor and speed. Consequently, the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Committee was established, and subsequently, anti-smoking branches were established in various provinces, cities, and counties. The prohibition of smoking, the prohibition of the grain tax levied on opium, the prohibition of trafficking, and the prohibition of transportation have yielded truly remarkable results. However, upon careful consideration, it is evident that medical professionals play a crucial role in assisting the anti-smoking campaign. The examination of smokers and the detoxification of opium addicts are almost entirely dependent on the involvement of medical professionals. Nevertheless, I believe that medical professionals can provide even greater assistance beyond examination and detoxification, namely, reporting to the authorities when opium addiction is discovered during patient diagnosis.</p>
<p>Some may argue: Doctors have a code of ethics that they must uphold, and preserving the privacy of patients is a key aspect of medical ethics. Anyone who discloses a patient's secrets without cause is subject to imprisonment under the law, and fellow professionals would be ashamed to associate with them. Doesn't your proposal risk violating criminal law and undermining medical ethics? I would respond: Matters vary in importance, and actions require adaptability. Judicious balance is the key. The anti-smoking campaign concerns the rise and fall of the nation, while maintaining confidentiality concerns the personal fortunes of an individual. Comparing the two in terms of importance, the former is greater, and the latter is smaller! Furthermore, I have heard that the new Italian criminal law stipulates that if doctors discover alcohol abuse during patient diagnosis, they must report it to the authorities; otherwise, they will be fined! This is because alcohol can disrupt social order. A patient's alcohol abuse is a patient's secret, yet Italian doctors do not allow the need for confidentiality to affect public safety. They truly understand what matters most. Does the impact of opium on the nation not outweigh the impact of alcohol on public safety by a hundred or a thousand times? I have also heard that doctors must report the discovery of infectious diseases to the authorities; otherwise, they will be fined! This is because the spread of epidemics can harm the public. A patient's illness is a patient's secret, yet doctors do not allow the need for confidentiality to affect public health. They truly understand how to balance priorities. Italy views the disruption of social order as no less significant than the spread of epidemics, hence the responsibility to report is entrusted to doctors. I would argue that the harm of opium is far greater than that of epidemics. Discovering opium addicts is like discovering patients with infectious diseases. Why should it be unacceptable? How does this conflict with medical confidentiality?</p>
<h3 id="e195">Humble Suggestions for the Ministry of Health to Urgently Establish Special Medical Training Classes <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Aiyun</p>
<p>This article was previously submitted as a formal request to the Ministry of Health by yours truly. Now, in accordance with the Ministry's approval number 257, which stipulates that it should be retained for reference, I will publicly disclose the main points of the submission, hoping to draw the attention of fellow professionals to this matter. (Aiyun's Postscript)</p>
<p>I recall that during a meeting of the Central Political Council in 1930, Central Committee member Dai Jitao proposed expanding medical and health education. The proposal stated, "...Given the urgent need for medical personnel in our country, it is imperative to address the current problem of cultivating and supplying medical professionals. At the same time, we must gradually improve standards to realize a comprehensive and universal medical system that suits current conditions and avoids any neglect. The goal of this expansion is to achieve a ratio of one doctor per thousand people within thirty years... The development of medical and health knowledge and the popularization of talent are crucial for saving the nation from decline and are fundamental to people's livelihood... The current difficulties in people's lives mean that even middle-class families find it difficult to cultivate a medical student..." Mr. Dai, recognizing the lack of new medical personnel in our country, sought to utilize the government's power to achieve the popularization of scientific medicine domestically. Hence, this proposal was made. However, in reality, time has passed, the news has faded, and it remains nothing more than a pie in the sky, adding a few more strokes to the official files.</p>
<p>Looking at the current number of doctors registered with the Ministry of Health, there are only five or six thousand in the entire country. Distributing this small number of doctors among our country, which boasts a population of 400 million, is like using a cartload of firewood to put out a burning cart of firewood, a cup of water to extinguish a burning cartload of fuel. If we are to talk about popularizing modern medicine and achieving a ratio of one doctor per thousand people within thirty years, I truly wonder how many thirty-year periods it will take!</p>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture, and farmers constitute the largest segment of the population. The health of farmers is fundamental to a strong nation. From this perspective, rural medical and health care are very important, and the need for rural doctors is naturally even more pressing. However, due to the small number of modern doctors, it is difficult to distribute them to rural areas. While this may not seem problematic in normal times, if an epidemic breaks out domestically, we will feel helpless and unable to provide relief. In summary, given the urgent need for doctors in our country and the difficulty of producing new doctors, why hasn't the authorities paid any attention to this important issue?</p>
<p>In a time when there is such a shortage of new medical personnel and such an urgent need for new medical personnel in rural areas, I believe there is still a way to remedy the situation through training. In the past, there was a temporary provision for granting certificates, but in reality, many doctors who met the criteria failed to register due to the expiration of the provision. These doctors may not have extensive theoretical knowledge but possess considerable experience. While they cannot compete with graduates of formal medical schools, they are certainly better than untrained practitioners who lack scientific knowledge. This group of people, who already possess a considerable amount of modern medical knowledge and skills and are around thirty years old, mostly live in rural areas and enjoy considerable trust. Now, because they are not registered, they are forced to cease practice. This not only creates problems for their livelihoods and the livelihoods of their families but also causes panic in rural areas that already feel the shortage of medical care. Furthermore, once these doctors become unemployed, it may be impossible for them to find alternative occupations at their age. Therefore, the government authorities should find a way to provide relief!</p>
<p>My idea is that if the Ministry of Health were to establish a "Special Medical Training Class," it could recruit these doctors for training, providing them with an opportunity for further education. This would not only supplement the insufficient number of doctors but also achieve a greater effect with less effort. These doctors could then be distributed to townships and villages, assisting the government in promoting rural health to save the nation from decline. On the other hand, this would also provide relief to these people, preventing them from becoming unemployed and helping them maintain their family's livelihood. This would bring significant benefits to the nation, the people's livelihood, and rural medical and health care. This method can be said to be superior to the provision for granting certificates. Therefore, the urgent establishment of a Special Medical Training Class by the Ministry of Health is a crucial task for addressing the current national health situation, alleviating the shortage of new medical personnel, and promoting rural medical and health care.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation, it would be best if the Ministry of Interior's Department of Health and the National Economic Council's Health Division jointly organized it. They could start by piloting the first Special Medical Training Class in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The qualifications for admission should be limited to those who met the criteria for the provision for granting certificates but failed to register due to its expiration, and who can provide proof from the local government's Public Security Bureau from 1930 to 1933, proving that they possess the ability of a doctor. Those who meet these criteria should be admitted without examination. The training should last for one year, and those who pass the examination upon completion should be granted a supplementary medical certificate, allowing them to practice medicine. Given the current national financial difficulties, it seems appropriate to charge tuition, lecture fees, practical fees, and boarding fees to cover the operating expenses of the class. Since the training only lasts for one year, the financial burden for each person would be at most around two hundred and fifty yuan, which each student should be able to afford. As for the faculty, senior personnel from the Ministry of Health, the Economic Council's Health Division, and the Central Three Offices could be hired to take on the role. In this way, I believe the Ministry of Health could pilot the first class. Regarding this plan, the senior doctors Song Guosheng and Pang Jingzhou have mentioned it in medical commentaries, and Doctor Xia Canglin has also published on it in the Medical Affairs Journal. The results in the future will surely be considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Recent Tuberculosis Prevention Efforts in Italy <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Italy, governed by Fascism, has recently adopted a purely Fascist approach to tuberculosis prevention. All tuberculosis prevention agencies and facilities are completely under the control of the central government. The following anti-tuberculosis decree has been implemented: hospitals or clinics are not permitted to admit or examine any tuberculosis patients without the central government having received a formal report from the patient's family. Furthermore, mothers with tuberculosis are not allowed to recuperate at home; otherwise, their children must be immediately removed to another location for isolation. Within one week of formal reporting, patients must be admitted to a sanatorium for treatment, and their homes must be disinfected. All hospitals have uniform regulations and standards for implementing tuberculosis prevention and treatment. For example, Milan province, covering an area of 2,801 cubic kilometers, has a population of two million. It has 23 tuberculosis guidance centers, six sanatoriums with a total of 2,500 beds, and 17 tuberculosis hospitals with a total of 2,925 beds. In addition, there are tuberculosis hospitals affiliated with public health insurance agencies, with 3,000 beds, and three tuberculosis prevention sanatoriums with a total of 1,000 beds. All tuberculosis guidance centers are equipped with X-ray, artificial pneumothorax, and bacterial testing equipment. They also have comprehensive disinfection equipment and sputum disinfection facilities, and most are connected to major hospitals. Private practitioners generally cooperate with expert physicians from the various tuberculosis guidance centers.</p>
<p>The economic resources for tuberculosis prevention come from a five-lire surcharge on all transportation tickets throughout Italy each week. In addition, several museums have increased their admission fees by ten lire on certain dates. In Milan province, each resident must pay one lira per year for tuberculosis prevention (equivalent to two dimes in Chinese currency). In 1931, Milan province held a tuberculosis flower sale, raising a total of 3.46 million lire. In recent years, its tuberculosis prevention efforts have been very successful, and the mortality rate from tuberculosis has gradually decreased. In 1930, 2,613 people died from tuberculosis in Milan province, while in 1932, the number was 2,343.</p>
<p>Given the social conditions in our country, there is no doubt that tuberculosis prevention is even more important than in any other country. Last year, Mayor Wu, Li Tingan, Yan Fuqing, my father, and others initiated the China Tuberculosis Association, which is a pressing need for our time. However, the financial income relies on the collection of membership fees. I believe that instead of recruiting a small number of members, mostly based on the face of introducers, even if they join this year, it will not be possible to force them to rejoin next year. Even if someone joins, it will take up a certain amount of time and energy from all parties each year. It would be better to learn from Italy's past wisdom and broadly levy tuberculosis prevention funds. The cost to each person is minimal, and since it concerns public welfare, the public will naturally be happy to assist. By accumulating small amounts, we can achieve greater results with less effort. With sufficient funding, our country's tuberculosis prevention efforts will surely increase in effectiveness, and in a few years, it will not be difficult to catch up with other countries. I submit this to the members of the association for their consideration. (Sent from the Pulmonary Research Institute, University of Hamburg, Germany)</p>
<h3 id="e197">Constipation and Laxatives <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Stories, No. 6—</p>
<p>American medical doctor Logan Clendening, in his famous book "The Human Body," has a passage on "constipation" that is quite insightful. I quote it here:</p>
<p>Some patients say: "I have been suffering from constipation for nearly ten years." Some say: "My depression and continuous fatigue are all due to constipation." Several years ago, a London doctor wrote an article stating</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>that constipation can cause neurasthenia, stomach ulcers, chest tumors, and even tuberculosis. He said that everyone should have their colon removed. But he did not have his own colon removed because he said his colon was very good. Most doctors believe that constipation is the root of all diseases.</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience, I find this unreliable. Most of the patients who come to me for constipation do not actually have symptoms of constipation. Let me give an example. One day, a patient came and said that he was suffering from constipation. Although he took laxatives every day, they were ineffective and asked me to find a way to treat him. To test whether the patient was truly suffering from constipation, I asked him to eat a piece of opaque food so that I could use X-rays to observe the digestive process. This was on Monday at ten in the morning. At four in the afternoon, the patient came again. The examination showed that the food had left the stomach and entered the intestines. I instructed the patient to stop taking laxatives that night in order to calculate the natural rate of food digestion and asked him to come again at noon the next day. This time, the food had moved into the transverse colon. I instructed him again to not take laxatives that night and to come again on the third day. This time, the food was no longer in the intestines. So I asked him: "Did you have a bowel movement this morning?" He replied with a surprised expression: "Yes, it's strange, this is the first time in years that I've had such a natural bowel movement." For years, this patient had been taking laxatives every day, never thinking that a bowel movement without laxatives would be even smoother. This is because laxatives constantly irritate the inner wall of the intestines, and the resulting feeling of fullness makes him feel that his intestinal tract is never empty.</p>
<p>In this way, taking laxatives actually causes constipation.</p>
<p>After reading this passage, we can understand that diagnosing whether constipation is real or not is an important task for doctors. Related to this is the fact that laxatives should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>Many laxatives were discovered by chance. A laxative called Epsom Salts (chemical composition is magnesium sulfate) was discovered in 1618 in a spring called Epsom on Dons Hill. According to legend, a farmer named Henry Wicks drove a herd of cattle to the spring on Dons Hill to drink water. Strangely, the cattle took one sip of the water and refused to drink any more. He tasted it himself and found that it was salty and bitter. Of course, he told his neighbors about this strange discovery. The local people began to use this spring water as an external application for treating skin ulcers and soreness, and it proved to be effective. A nobleman named Dudley North first tried using it as an internal medicine and found that it had a laxative effect. He then wrote an article publishing his discovery. As a result, Epsom Salts became a common laxative at the time.</p>
<p>Phenolphthalein is a new laxative. The history of this laxative's discovery is quite interesting. Before becoming a laxative, it was a common material in chemical laboratories because it has a property of turning red when it encounters alkali and remaining colorless when it encounters acid. Several years ago, the Hungarian government enacted a law stipulating that white wine must be mixed with a certain amount of phenolphthalein in order to test whether the wine was adulterated with inferior goods. After this law was implemented, dysentery spread rampantly throughout Hungary, indicating that the previously considered harmless phenolphthalein had strong laxative properties. At the same time, magicians who performed the "turning water into wine" trick often suffered from diarrhea after performing the trick. It turned out that the clear water in the pot contained sodium carbonate, and the empty glass cup that received the clear water poured from the pot had been pre-filled with a few drops of phenolphthalein. The alkaline water, when it came into contact with the phenolphthalein, naturally turned wine-red. Each time the fake wine was made, the performer himself took a sip, deliberately pretending to taste the wine in order to dazzle the audience. This is how he ingested several doses of laxative in a row, and diarrhea was naturally the inevitable result. Phenolphthalein can be mixed into candy and gum, so it is a laxative that is easy for children to take.</p>
<p>According to Doctor Clendening, the most natural laxative is not any medicine but vegetables. Because the cellulose contained in vegetables is not digested but remains in the intestines to promote intestinal excretion. This is the only type of laxative that is truly beneficial and harmless.</p>

<p>Part Two Gonorrhea</p>
<p>D. If gonorrhea persists for a long time and the virus spreads, then, based on anatomical and physiological relationships, the following may occur:</p>
<p>(1) Paraurethritis: A small amount of pus is discharged from the paraurethral ducts. A slightly hard, rope-like object or nodule can be felt locally.</p>
<p>(2) Periurethral infiltration: Forms a hard cord. Abscesses may also form, requiring incision.</p>
<p>(3) Cowper's gland inflammation: Painful nodules occur between the scrotum and the anus, especially painful during bowel movements. In severe cases, the inflammation spreads to the surrounding tissues, causing cellulitis.</p>
<p>(4) Prostatitis: In the rectum, swelling, hardening, and pain of the prostate gland can be palpated. There is also a subjective sensation of pain in the prostate region, frequent urination, stabbing pain during ejaculation, or seminal leakage. In more severe cases, inflammation occurs in most or all of the prostate, accompanied by chills, shivering, fever, and marked frequent urination, pain in the perineum or rectal region during defecation and sitting, and if it turns into an abscess, it often ruptures into the urethra, temporarily discharging a large amount of pus and relieving the symptoms. It may also rupture into the rectum, causing rectal gonorrhea, or rupture into the bladder or perineum or pelvic connective tissue, or become thrombophlebitis, sepsis, and other systemic diseases, but this is extremely rare.</p>
<p>(5) Seminal vesiculitis: Particularly painful during ejaculation. The semen appears bloody and purulent.</p>
<p>(6) Epididymitis: Often accompanied by chills, shivering, and fever. The epididymis is swollen and painful. At this time, it often impairs sperm production, leading to infertility.</p>
<p>(7) Cystitis: Severe pain, urgency to urinate, frequent urination, discomfort, heaviness, and pain in the lower abdomen. Sometimes, the internal sphincter spasms and causes urinary incontinence.</p>
<p>(8) Ureteritis and pyelonephritis</p>
<p>At this time, there are chills, shivering, high fever, headache, vomiting, and pain in the lower back.</p>
<p>(9) Others, such as balanitis, phimosis, and urethral stricture. All organs related to the male urinary and reproductive system may be susceptible to disease.</p>
<p>(II) Gonorrhea in Women The symptoms of gonorrhea in women differ due to anatomical differences. The differing symptoms are described below:</p>
<p>A. Skene's gland inflammation Local redness and swelling. A small amount of pus leaks out when compressed.</p>
<p>B. Bartholin's gland inflammation This gland is frequently affected. The symptoms are a fluctuating tumor bulging within the labia minora. The labia are red and swollen with severe pain. If it ruptures naturally, it will discharge a large amount of yellow-green pus.</p>
<p>C. Rectal gonorrhea Anatomically, a woman's vaginal wall is closely attached to the rectum, so rectal gonorrhea is common in women. Burning pain is felt, especially during bowel movements. Sometimes pus leaks out of the rectum. The skin around the anus is also red, swollen, and injured or ulcerated due to irritation from the secretions.</p>
<p>D. Others, such as vulvitis and vaginitis. Although the names are different, the symptoms are not particularly different from those of balanitis, phimosis, and urethritis in men. I will not elaborate further.</p>
<p>(III) Metastatic Gonorrhea Due to metastasis via blood or lymph circulation. Gonococcal arthritis, tenosynovitis, bursitis, endocarditis, etc., can occur. Each has its own specific symptoms, which are omitted here.</p>

<p>(58) Laryngeal Tuberculosis (Continued)</p>
<p>An inevitable symptom of this disease is hoarseness. In severe cases, the voice can be completely lost. There is also frequent coughing. If ulcers develop, there will be mucus-like purulent sputum. Patients feel some pain when swallowing. If infiltration or disintegration occurs at the entrance of the larynx, severe difficulty in swallowing will occur. Sometimes, aspiration may occur. When the patient coughs or speaks, they often feel pain in the throat. Breathing difficulty is usually absent unless there is significant inflammatory edema. In addition, patients often complain of fever. If we press on the larynx from the outside, the patient often feels pain. Sometimes, swelling can be palpated. This is because of secondary perichondritis. The changes in the pharynx are that the mucous membrane appears distinctly anemic and pale. This is also a unique symptom of this disease. The changes within the larynx are that the mucous membrane develops tuberculous infiltration and tuberculous ulcers. Therefore, in general, in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, if their condition progresses, the infiltrated tissue caused by laryngeal tuberculosis will lose its resistance and disintegrate, forming a flat ulcer. The larger ones can sometimes reach the size of a pea. At this time, most patients suffer from difficulty in swallowing. In addition, it is important to note that in many patients, small, yellow, millet-sized nodules develop in the larynx due to blood circulation. These nodules soon rupture and form creeping superficial ulcers. At this point, if sputum is examined, tubercle bacilli are often present. Early diagnosis and early treatment are crucial for this disease. However, early diagnosis is not easy. This is because its symptoms, such as hoarseness, difficulty in swallowing, and suffocation, are also common in other laryngeal diseases. Moreover, laryngeal tuberculosis is often combined with acute or chronic catarrhal symptoms. Do not mistakenly regard these symptoms as catarrhal symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis. Furthermore, it is especially important to distinguish it from other diseases such as syphilis, tumors, and hoarseness caused by nervous disorders. The most reliable diagnosis is examination with a laryngoscope. Therefore, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis should regularly undergo laryngoscopic examination by a specialist to check for local lesions. Do not miss the opportunity for early diagnosis and early treatment. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>The treatment methods for laryngeal tuberculosis are very complex and cannot be generalized. Because this disease is often a complication of pulmonary tuberculosis, general health care and treatment methods for pulmonary tuberculosis should be implemented first. Take in large amounts of nutritious food and pay attention to air regulation. As for local treatment of the disease, it can be divided into three types: drug therapy, surgical therapy, and light therapy. Drug therapy includes drug injection, drug application, drug corrosion, drug powder insufflation, and drug inhalation. Surgical therapy includes forceps removal, electrocautery, and tracheotomy. Among light therapies, artificial sun lamps with a device for directly irradiating the larynx and the lamp invented by the Austrian Viennese physician Mr. Huishilai are more effective. It is worth trying.</p>

<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Throat Pain</p>
<p>Tonsillitis and Pharyngitis: Tonsils, located on both sides of the throat, often become inflamed, causing pain with each inflammation. When inflamed, the tonsils become red and swollen, often with white spots. The body temperature can rise to 101 degrees Fahrenheit. The entire throat also becomes inflamed alongside the tonsillitis. Tonsillitis is caused by common throat bacteria becoming active during a cold. Inflammation usually subsides and returns to normal after several days. For tonsillitis treatment, severe cases require bed rest, while mild cases do not. A liquid diet is recommended. In addition, gargle with a throat medicine such as a mixture of one-quarter Hydrogen Peroxide (one-quarter Hydrogen Peroxide mixed with three-quarters water) or a 2% sodium borate solution, several times a day. Tonsils that become inflamed throughout the year should be removed to prevent bacteria from entering the heart and causing carditis, or entering the joints and causing rheumatism or arthritis.</p>
<p>Peritonsillar Abscess: Around the tonsils near the throat opening, bacteria often invade from the tonsils, causing inflammation and forming an abscess. Patients feel swelling and pain on one side of the throat and have difficulty swallowing. Upon opening the mouth, the tonsils and surrounding area are red and swollen. Patients also often experience chills and fever within one to two days. Before an abscess forms, treatment includes resting and applying hot and cold compresses to the neck. Once an abscess forms, it must be surgically incised to drain the pus.</p>
<p>Diphtheria or Throat Scarlatina: Most people now know that diphtheria is a very dangerous disease. Although people fear diphtheria, sometimes they are unaware when the disease strikes. Diphtheria often occurs imperceptibly, with the first sensation being a sore throat. Examination of the throat reveals a grayish-white membrane, and diphtheria bacteria can be found under a microscope or after culturing. Patients develop a fever of approximately 100 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Note that diphtheria is transmitted through close contact with infected individuals. The first priority upon contracting diphtheria is to inject diphtheria antitoxin serum as early as possible. Before the invention of antitoxin serum, an average of one in three diphtheria patients died. Since the use of diphtheria antitoxin serum, the mortality rate has significantly decreased, with approximately one in ten or twenty patients dying on average. It is also crucial to note that early injection of antitoxin serum results in a lower mortality rate, while late injection results in a higher mortality rate. According to statistics, the mortality rate for diphtheria patients injected with diphtheria antitoxin serum on the first day of illness is 15 per 1,000. The mortality rate for those injected on the second day is 34 per 1,000. The mortality rate for those injected on the third day is 69 per 1,000. The mortality rate for those injected on the fourth day is 109 per 1,000. The mortality rate for those injected on the fifth day is 150 per 1,000. The mortality rate for those not injected is 350 per 1,000. Let's compare: the mortality rate for those not injected is 25 times higher than for those injected on the first day. The mortality rate for those injected on the fifth day is ten times higher than for those injected on the first day. The mortality rate for those injected on the fourth day is approximately seven times higher than for those injected on the first day. The mortality rate for those injected on the third day is four and a half times higher than for those injected on the first day. The mortality rate for those injected on the second day is more than twice as high as for those injected on the first day. Diphtheria does not kill patients through throat pain, but through diphtheria toxin entering the blood, damaging the heart, or blocking the respiratory tract and suffocating the patient. In summary, the primary treatment for diphtheria throat pain is to inject diphtheria antitoxin serum, preferably on the first day of illness. Never treat it as a common sore throat.</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 6: Renal Tuberculosis</p>
<p>In addition to detailed urine examination, there are two other examination procedures that are absolutely essential for accurately diagnosing this condition. The first is cystoscopy, which immediately reveals the condition of the mucous membrane. (Bladder tuberculosis is mostly caused by the downward spread of kidney tuberculosis; therefore, finding tuberculous lesions in the bladder can indirectly prove kidney tuberculosis.) Regarding whether the ureter is passable, and whether the kidney tuberculosis affects the right or left kidney, or both kidneys are affected, these important questions can be confirmed or denied by performing ureteral catheterization. The second is X-ray examination, which is crucial for demonstrating the shape and size of the kidney, as well as calcified lesions. Both of these examination methods should be performed by a specialist physician; otherwise, it will be difficult to distinguish between right and wrong, almost tantamount to calling a deer a horse!</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of this disease, surgery may not be necessary in the early stages. The approach is generally similar to that of ordinary tuberculosis (chronic form) and chronic nephritis. Injections of tuberculin are sometimes very effective. Metal-based treatments are very likely to irritate the kidneys and should be avoided. X-ray therapy is also ineffective. If the disease is progressing or spreading, we should check the condition of the other kidney. If it is completely healthy, the diseased kidney can be surgically removed; this approach sometimes yields very good results. As for the patient's diet and daily life, they are the same as for ordinary pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Calcutta, 26th: Gandhi today requested 350 million Indians to donate to the Red Cross to provide relief in Abyssinia, stating, "Mussolini's threat to all people of color around the world makes it impossible for India to remain indifferent. Although India is not a belligerent nation, as a member of the League of Nations, it should assist another member nation."</p>
<p>The conflict between Italy and Abyssinia is no longer merely a dispute between nations, but has involved the issue of race. Gandhi's call for people of color expresses his outrage. It is heard that Indians are expressing strong sympathy for Abyssinia. This situation will directly affect British colonial and East African policies.</p>
<p>Racial concepts, in a world where human interaction is becoming increasingly close, still exist in the minds of various races. The 20th-century world is evidently the world of white people. Therefore, people have developed the so-called fear of racial war. Many people predict that future wars will evolve from national disputes into racial conflicts.</p>
<p>In fact, this is perhaps an overestimation of future problems. Whether racial wars will occur in the future cannot, of course, be predicted. But at present, the phenomenon of people of the same race trampling on each other can still be seen everywhere. As long as there are conflicting interests, even people of the same race helping people of a different race is not considered strange. This is not only true of people of color, who each plot for their own benefit, but also of white people, who are known for their strong solidarity. Therefore, I believe that racial war, assuming it can occur, is far from today.</p>
<p>What is inevitable in the future is the struggle between the oppressed and the oppressors. The world today can be roughly divided into two major classes: the oppressed and the oppressors. The oppressed are generally weak nations, and the oppressors are the so-called great powers. The latter take sacrificing the interests of the former as a means of self-preservation. The former can only eke out an existence under the control and domination of the latter. The opposition between these two classes is irreconcilable. Once it breaks down in the future, a major struggle will immediately occur. This is a glorious war of the oppressed against the powerful. India's expression of sympathy for Abyssinia is, rather than being based on racial concepts, more accurately described as a form of mutual assistance among weak nations.</p>
<p>Racial war is formed from narrow racial concepts. The struggle between the oppressed and the oppressors, this meaning is great. Because true human equality can only be realized after the oppressed are liberated. Sun Yat-sen said that China's demand for freedom and equality requires uniting the world's weak nations and fighting together. This understanding is very clear. China's future outlet may lie here.</p>

<p>— Xia Yin</p>
<p>(1) Green Lamp</p>
<p>Every night, wiping clean the green lamp on the corner of the table, a perplexed sentiment gently emerges from the bottom of my heart. This lonely wandering life has worn down my young life into a green lamp, containing the raging flames: gradually drifting away from those bright and joyful days.</p>
<p>This green lamp has accompanied me through so many difficult days! Under its green, serene light, I have never been idle in cultivating the necessities of life, and the beautiful dreams that many young people have. Lengthy and arduous labor has worn away my innocence. For the world, for life, a blurred black shadow unfolds, blocking the forbidden land of happiness that I long for. Making me acutely aware of the vagueness of the future and the cruelty of reality. Although all these only stir up my indignation, turning my fiery eyes to confront all the vile phenomena: not kneeling and kowtowing to life; not letting this bright red heart be tainted by the slightest flaw, as proud as a plum blossom in the snowy mountains, scattering its solitary fragrance in the icy wilderness</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>of the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>Yes, I accept all the suffering cast upon me by the world, using my own strength to cultivate life, to obtain life. Not envying the happiness of others, but blessing my own efforts and struggles. Others will naturally inevitably see me as an unenterprising coward, a mediocre and worthless fool. But, I have my own views, ideals. These shallow and snobbish ridicule cannot shake my conviction. For myself, I am very clear that in this ordinary life, even the smallest bubbles and ripples contain many moving and admirable struggles, that is the sublimation of my blood, the sublimation of my sweat, the sublimation of my whole personality. For myself, it is all worthy of pride.</p>
<p>This is not an exaggerated and self-consoling argument. People are not like witless oxen, the purpose of endurance and cultivation is not in a short period of rest. They have a greater ideal, they want to cultivate a full field of green seedlings and hunger-saving rice in the dry and barren land.</p>
<p>Although, life is ultimately bitter. I will not forget the suffering of these days, gradually drifting away from those bright and joyful days, my young life has been worn down into a green lamp, containing the raging flames, letting passion hide in my heart. Naturally, for these difficult days, the gradually changing life, it is inevitable that it will stir up a sense of sadness at the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>But, difficult days bring a difficult life. Life is originally climbing towards the road stretching out under one's feet. Even if this road is rugged and dangerous, one must clench one's teeth and crawl up!</p>
<p>Let those bright and joyful days drift away forever. Always be accompanied by the green lamp, use your own strength to cultivate life, to obtain life!</p>
<p>(2) Dream</p>
<p>Accompanying me through these long, lonely wandering days is the dream that is never finished. These dreams are so ordinary, always the same tune, dreaming that the universe is full of crimson and green flowers.</p>
<p>After seeing everything clearly, I often ask myself with determination.</p>
<p>—For the sake of cherishing my own youth, can't I end this illusory dream?</p>
<p>Naturally, as the days go by, I gradually feel the sadness in my heart, like a soft and greasy spider silk weaving and binding in my heart for no reason, even with the strength to shatter cauldrons and uproot mountains, I cannot tear away this delicate thing. So, I cannot help but gently sigh, I regret that my vitality also has weak factors. However——</p>
<p>—The war song of the mountain eagle is loud and clear, when the wind and rain come, it always cannot forget the peaceful mountains and forests.</p>
<p>Even the brave warriors on the battlefield have their "battlefield dreams", although I am stubborn, how can I escape this instinct?</p>
<p>Life is originally a stage for struggle. There will never be a time when the universe is full of crimson and green flowers!</p>
<p>For myself, I must take good care of myself, but also not forget that human vitality also has weak factors.</p>

<p>At this time, the houses are all empty, all the people, big and small, male and female, have all escaped to the open space in front of the door: telling stories, making jokes, and some people are reporting some unreliable news heard from teahouses or the streets and alleys. Uncle Jinbao, however, is sitting alone on a white wooden stool, picking salt-fried beans and sipping white liquor, his wife is sitting on the bluestone beside him, feeding the child porridge.</p>
<p>There are also many older children who have each taken a glass bottle or duck eggshell to catch fireflies in the lawn.</p>
<p>"Be careful of snakes, insects, and centipedes; catching fireflies that will snatch your souls, catch them and use them for food!" The women are scolding their children like this, but those naughty children are unwilling to listen, if they don't catch them here, they run to the trellis of trichosanthes kirilowii to catch them again.</p>
<p>"Little... Dong people... got into... trouble..." A Jin, who is particularly fond of inquiring about gossip, has just returned from town drunk, humming an out-of-tune "Three Mothers Teach Son" in his mouth.</p>
<p>"You're happy! The rice for tomorrow's breakfast is still flying in the sky, but you still want to worship Huang Tang, worship urine!" His wife, leaning against a Toona sinensis tree, glared at him and said resentfully.</p>
<p>"Haha! Tomorrow, screw him, we'll figure it out after today!" He said, sitting down on the threshold; "Do you know? Today the Yin Gou family caught a thief stealing pumpkins."</p>
<p>"I guessed long ago that Bao Datian would go to town to inquire, there would always be news brought back." Sister-in-law Cai Bao said playfully.</p>
<p>"Alas! This world, everyone is about to starve to death, things are not growing firmly at all, there are so many thieves, stealing every day, who has such constant eyes to watch!" Father Si, who had not spoken for a long time, finally began to feel emotional.</p>
<p>The cool breeze of the summer evening blows gently towards this open space, driving away all the heat of the day; so everyone feels a little tired, and everyone is looking towards their own house.</p>

<p>— Mo Jia</p>
<p>Thinking of my home in the south</p>
<p>Oh, the May weather of my beloved hometown! At the end of the mountains, at the far end of the sea, the mild climate of the south, there is a clear sky, a beautiful scenery, although summer is coming to an end, but there, it is the season for late-ripening longans, the season for late-blooming oranges to give off fragrance, and the season for late-ripening red grape bunches to come on the market. These fruits, which carry sweet or perhaps sour flavors, are the only gifts that accompany you to eliminate the long summer. When noon arrives, the house is a bit stuffy, so bring a branch, or a bunch of longans, along with a bamboo mat, spread it under the shade of several banyan trees in front of the house, slowly peeling the longan shells, the lychee shells, eating them, eating them, you probably don't need a fan, the wind has already blown in gusts from the fields, blowing up the fragrance of oranges. And thinking of longans, one thinks of a section of gentle feelings that contain honey juice like longans, at that time, there was a young woman living in the neighborhood, her family planted a clump of old longans, which always bloomed the latest and bore fruit the latest, waiting until they were rotten ripe, when the longan festival was over, hers could just be picked, the size was particularly large, and it was also particularly flavorful, and this young woman, her own name was exactly Longan, because she had a pair of shiny, round eyeballs like longan pits, and a skin color as black as the color of longans, and she had been particularly fond of longans since she was a child, her name, Longan Sister, was what people had gotten used to calling her. Whenever her family picked longans, she would always bring a few handfuls to my house herself. Longan Sister, Longan Sister, the weather is so hot, you still come out yourself, keep it for yourself, we have already eaten a lot. I said with an almost joking tone, she stood there a little shyly, smiling lightly, her longan-like beads shining with charming black luster, you always like to tease, saying she pursed her lips, threw a handful of longans in my direction, and left. Looking at her pretty back, my heart couldn't help but move, I did praise her simple smile, her pure words, but I couldn't lightly tell anyone the secrets in my heart, these secrets I could only let it quietly hide deep in my heart, in the first year after I left home, Longan Sister had already, at the suggestion of her parents, married a stranger, my unknown thoughts also became an unknown eternal regret. Three years ago, I once went back, coincidentally Longan Sister also came back to her parents' home during my return, but she was already holding a child, it was still summer, I saw her sitting in front of her own house, it was evening, she bared her chest to feed the child milk, Longan Sister, so fast, do you still recognize me? She looked at me with a little shyness and smiled, I thought of the unmarried Longan Sister when I was young, I stirred up my unknown and forgotten thoughts, I secretly felt sadness for a person losing her youth for no reason. Now that I have left my hometown again for several years, Longan Sister should have raised several children again.</p>
<p>2. Midnight</p>
<p>At night, the house is still hot and stuffy, without a bit of wind, there is wind outside, but because the window lattice is small, and it faces north, it can't blow in, people sit still, and sweat flows non-stop, so I had to turn off the light, thinking of eliminating a little of the heat of the light, but as soon as the light was turned off, the mosquitoes became proud, buzzing and making a big fuss, looking for an opportunity to bite hard on the body, after driving away this one, that one was biting on the back again. There was no way, I had to sneak out, just walking out the door, a cool breeze blew towards my face, my feeling suddenly relaxed, I took a light breath, outside it was really like another world, the house seemed like a steamer compared to it, so terrible. Walking along the pebble path. The surroundings were quiet, the night was deep, there was a large moon in the sky, the silvery light melted the earth in the sway of mercury, the stars were very sparse, I casually sat on a lawn, looking at the misty sky, a light and crisp mood, my heart was also light and loose because of this, but when that occasional lonely wild goose call flew past in mid-air, although it flew far away, the desolate feeling stayed unshakably in my heart, and I was always too concerned about the moon in the sky, the twinkling stars, especially fond of that light and cool wind, often sitting in a daze in this empty and melting midnight heart, sometimes even when the moon sinks and the stars bathe, I am still unwilling to leave, and I am always given a little illness by midnight because of this.</p>

<p>Quietly, a pink cloud floats over the top of the house.</p>
<p>In that clean white building, the nurses are saying, "Oh, it's night again."</p>
<p>They are wearing white clothes and white hats. Their faces, skin, and hair are not white. They are very quiet and demure, like a flock of little birds nesting in their nests.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's night again."</p>
<p>"Yes. Dr. Ling said that in half an hour, if the woman in room three still hasn't given birth, they will have to operate on her."</p>
<p>"Hmm. Amen."</p>
<p>"Amen." Making the sign of the cross. The two of them separated.</p>
<p>Gently pushing open the white door of room three.</p>
<p>A desolate, painful scream clearly echoed in the room.</p>
<p>"Nurse, it hurts, save me..." The pregnant woman's face was very pale, as if someone had stabbed her leg with a small knife. She tossed and turned on the bed.</p>
<p>"Nurse, please save her." An elderly woman accompanying the pregnant woman said so sorrowfully, wiping away her tears.</p>
<p>"Don't let her roll around on the bed! The doctor will be here soon." She arranged the white cotton, gauze, and the shiny white tray, shiny pliers, and rubber gloves. Then, she pushed open the door and walked out.</p>
<p>And the pregnant woman's painful scream was incessantly pouring out like smoke from a chimney.</p>
<p>"Help!"</p>
<p>One of the nurses said, "Lord, save her!"</p>
<p>Dr. Ling pushed open the door of room three. Seven or eight young nurses followed him quietly and demurely.</p>
<p>The pregnant woman's face was almost as white as the white coat worn by the doctors.</p>
<p>"Doctor, please save her." The elderly woman said timidly.</p>
<p>"Hmm." Dr. Ling nodded. He stood in front of the bed and observed the pregnant woman's movements. Then, he pressed the pregnant woman's pulse.</p>
<p>"Oh, it hurts, it hurts, doctor, save me!" The</p>

<p>pregnant woman, whose lips had also turned gray, suddenly screamed wildly again.</p>
<p>After looking at the pregnant woman, Dr. Ling turned his head and said to the young nurses:</p>
<p>"It's a difficult birth. Let's pray for her.</p>
<p>So everyone knelt down in an orderly manner. Even the elderly woman who was chanting "Amitabha" was told to kneel down.</p>
<p>Then one of the young nurses recited a prayer.</p>
<p>The pregnant woman's pain intensified. The air was filled with solemnity.</p>
<p>"Amen." Everyone made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>The prayer was over. And the pregnant woman's painful scream had become low and hoarse.</p>
<p>When it dawned, the nurses performed a second prayer for the pregnant woman, in the surgical room.</p>
<p>Before long, one of the nurses walked out of the door and said to the elderly woman who was sitting on the long bench outside the surgical room door, chanting "Amitabha":</p>
<p>"Your daughter-in-law has died of suffocation. Because the surgery was performed too late."</p>
<p>"Then the child, is the boy alright?" the elderly woman asked quickly.</p>
<p>"He is very well, madam."</p>
<p>"Hmm, that's lucky! Amitabha!" The elderly woman's anxiety seemed to lessen. She suddenly fixed her gaze on the nurse and asked:</p>
<p>"Hey, nurse, where are the clothes my daughter-in-law changed out of?"</p>
<p>"They were probably left in the sickroom. Is something the matter?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, were you the one who changed her clothes?" Her expression softened.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then please tell me, does she have the small leather wallet with the money in her pocket?" Her tears had also dried up.</p>
<p>"I don't know about that. What are you planning to do, madam?"</p>
<p>"I plan to buy some eggs to dye red eggs."</p>
<p>"Madam, can you still dye red eggs when someone has died?"</p>
<p>"Huh, it's a woman who died! It doesn't count for much. Why can't I dye red eggs? Amitabha." The elderly woman opened her mouth and smiled, continuing, "Nurse, can you lead me to see the baby boy? Oh, maybe she also has a purse in her pocket. Let me take the purse first and then go see the baby boy."</p>

<p>Opening: "Fisherman's Footprints"</p>
<p>Skilled in navigating ships, he roams everywhere. The "Myriad Homes of Spring" sails heavily on rivers. His body is accustomed to being at home anywhere in the world. He has no worries about food and clothing, living a carefree life. Why bother distinguishing between noble and lowly by attire? One's fate is entirely determined by their inherent character. The copper coins he earns are spent as quickly as they come. In his leisure, he enjoys drinking alone. By himself at the top of the building, he toasts to Li Bai [a famous poet], nodding, clapping, and laughing heartily. Who knew the tavern owner had a preference for beauty? He secretly teases the fisherman's daughter, Xiao Yu. Luckily, the gentleman sees this with a cold eye. He wants to call the local constable and neighbors. Who is without sin for raping a woman? He doesn't care about making amends early. He reluctantly writes a confession in his own hand. Every year, he drinks and racks up a tab. The word "tab" is better off nonexistent. In this life and the next, he will have no bar tab. Who dares to treat me coldly in the future? He secretly helps to save the beautiful maiden by assassinating the traitor Liang Ji. Truly, he is a little man of the world.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Lu Shi took over the Performing Arts Experimental Institute, he has been working hard to reorganize it. The new site that the institute is scheduled to move to is currently under repair. It is expected to be able to move in by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. Currently, it is temporarily using the old site for office work and classes. Many people have signed up for the institute's second round of student recruitment. Today (the 5th) is the first examination period, and the second examination period will be on the 12th.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Recent News of "Mr. Wang" <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang, Tang Jie, is shooting exterior scenes for "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" in the Suzhou countryside. The news has spread far and wide, and more than 500 people come to watch every day.</p>
<p>Little A Yuan, Huang Naishuang, has a deep appreciation for elegance. In her spare time, she often catches shrimp and frogs by the river, which is quite poetic. Zuo Ming even gave her the elegant title of "woman poet."</p>
<p>Little Chen was late to go to "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" because there were few exterior scenes for him. He has now received a letter from Tang Jie saying that his scenes will be filmed tomorrow. Therefore, Cao Xuesong, together with Zhai Qiqi and many extras, decided to take the express train to Suzhou this morning (the 4th).</p>

<p>The crew of the new film "Sea Burial" returned from Yantai yesterday.</p>
<p>The "Sea Burial" crew worked on the Shandong coast for nearly two months. Every day, intelligence personnel recorded the work in detail for public release.</p>
<p>Interior scenes for "Sea Burial" will be shot soon.</p>
<p>The ship used in "Sea Burial" has already been built.</p>
<p>The re-examination of "Welcoming Spring Song" has already been sent to Beijing for review. As soon as it passes, preparations for filming will begin.</p>
<p>The sound film "Mother" has now been completed, and director Wen Yimin is busy editing it.</p>
<p>The two new songs inserted in "Mother" will be printed and distributed to all sectors of society in the coming days.</p>
<p>It is said that the sound film "Two Brothers" was originally named "Liu Xiaofeng."</p>
<p>Lu Lixia told people that "Two Brothers" is the only one of her works that she is relatively satisfied with.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Special Feature on Situ Huimin, Director of "Goddess of Freedom" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Situ Huimin, the writer and director of Diantong's "Goddess of Freedom," used his "personal" experience of the "May Fourth" movement and the revolutionary Northern Expedition as the weft, and a struggling woman in a turbulent era as the warp to write this "Goddess of Freedom." He also boldly and carefully directs this film with his extensive experience in photography. The magnificent revolutionary historical facts in the play require him to have a firm and controlled hand to express. Seeing his style in every crowd scene is like seeing him in person: concise and experienced, without hesitation or doubt. But in places that require care, he also has a more humble attitude. In order to obtain historical materials about the "May Fourth" era in the play, he went to Hangzhou twice to conduct on-the-ground investigations into the social customs of Hangzhou at that time. In addition, with his past experience in set design and sound recording, "the overall success of the visuals and sound of 'Goddess of Freedom' can be predicted with certainty."</p>

<p>The sixth issue of Diantong Pictorial has been published. This issue is a special issue on "Goddess of Freedom." The cover is a portrait of Wang Ying, and the back cover is a group photo of Lan Ping, Shi Chao, and Zhou Bodong. Photos: There are sixteen extremely precious photos of Wang Ying's private life, stills from the "Goddess of Freedom" starring both of them, and working photos of the warriors who fought for freedom. And child star Ren Ke holding a gun. Text: Situ Huimin's "Goddess of Freedom" novel and "After the Birth of 'Goddess of Freedom'" by Wang Ying, Tang Na's translated poem dedicated to freedom. A traveller's expectation of the appearance of "Goddess of Freedom 1," HINTZ's "Goddess of Freedom" and the Goddess of Peace, and short articles by Lan Ping, Wu Mei, Shi Chao, Fang Yan, etc., and the "Goddess of Freedom" theme song composed by Shi Yi and composed by Lü Ji. Recently, the film industry has been unfortunate. Nie Er passed away in the sea in Japan after Mr. Zhengqiu.
