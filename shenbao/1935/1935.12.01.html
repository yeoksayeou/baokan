<h3 id="c14">國人對于華北事態應有之認識 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>自通州事變發生。中日關係。益趨緊張。日軍增兵冀東。且一度佔領平津間重要車站。其威脅手段。無所不用其極。國府對于股汝耕輩之僞自治運動。因亦迄未能作妥善有效之應付當此華北諸省。重陷于不安狀態。之際凡具國家觀念之國人。當無不深感其應有之救國責任。然吾人在今日而言救國。首須對當前之華北事態。有明確的認識。請就此點。分三方面述之。</p>
<p>第一。日本在今日形勢之下。固有深入華北之意。然其政府鑒于英美態度及我國民氣。尙不能不有所顧慮。而以武力奪取華北。尤可斷其决非所願。蓋華北成爲焦十于。日有何益乎。雖然。日本軍人亦未始不欲效法瀋陽事變之故智。而以自由行動在華北創立新局面。以待其政府之追認。冀東之僞自治組織。卽其一例。但吾人當知日本軍人氣熖雖盛。設我全國一致。以堅决的意志審愼的態度。以爲應付。則彼一時高張之氣燄。當亦可以稍戢也。</p>
<p>第二。我華北將領。如宋哲元。商震。韓復榘等。就歷來態度以觀。均能深明大義。效忠中央。近在威脅利誘之下。而不投入偽自治之旋渦。尤足顯示其剛正之氣節。國人對於華北諸將頒當予以極大之信任與鼓勵。俾能各盡其守土之責任。</p>
<p>第三。我政府對日外交方針。蔣委員長在五全代會演詞中已有明顯之表示歸納言之。即「以不侵犯主權爲限度。謀各友邦之政治協調」及「抱定最後犧牲之决心。而爲和平最大之努力」二語。最近外部爲在華日本軍人策動所謂「華北自治運動」及日軍擅自佔據豐台車站兩事。已向日本駐華大使分別提出嚴重抗議。而對殷汝耕叛國一切行爲。並照會各國。聲明無效。新任行政院駐平辦事長官何應欽復於昨日啟程北上。應付一切。凡此均足證明我政府正在嚴守忍耐之最大限度。而作和平最大之努力。此種外交行動之適應時機。尤爲國人所當認識者也。</p>
<p>今日華北局勢雖極嚴重。尙未至和平絕望程度。國人正宜以冷靜縝密之頭腦。對民族前途作審愼之考量。以舉國一致之意志。爲政府外交作堅强之後盾。設國内不能互信互諒。而尙有意氣從事。輕舉妄動。以求逞快於一時者。　我民族前途。恐將不堪設想矣。</p>

<p>（東京）預算閣議於突破軍部預算之難關、感多大之困難、迄本日清晨、始到達妥恊案、從上午七時十分起、開最後之預算閣議、由高橋藏相陳述意見、謂較大藏省之査定原案、對於陸漲軍第一次各承認一千萬元、第二次承認陸軍八百萬元、海軍二百萬元之復活要求、然其財源不求之於公債、適合予之本懷、次由川島陸相以預算費時甚久、表示謝意、一時極度險惡化之閣議、至此雲消霧散、各閣員均喜形於色、於七時二十分散會、（三十日電通電）</p>

<p>— 喬啟明　蔣傑</p>
<p>（五）人口和土地的失調二十三年來的農戶增加二分之一，耕地面積只增加八分之一，所以生活資料勢必緩緩添多，而立待消費者郤屬日衆。在這種過程中，農民生活的趨向如何，巳可思議過半。</p>
<p>現再在數字方面，加以分析，以明其嚴重性的程度。</p>
<p>（一）每家平均人口附表上的數字，都是本年的統計，分向各鎭鄉長保存的戶口冊上抄來。由於江寗縣縣政府厲行人口淸査及登記，這項材料當屬最爲正確。按一鎭四鄕即每家平均人口有四。六八人，各鎭鄕的差異極微。</p>
<p>附表（一）</p>
<p>江蘇江甯一鎭四鄕每個農村家庭平均人口（民國二十四年調查）</p>
<p>鎭鄉名稱　秣陵鎭　孝陵鄉　仁陵鄉　信陵鄉　愛陵鄉　總計</p>
<p>調查村莊數　一一　一四　二一　三六　一七　八九</p>
<p>共計戶數　四三〇　五八一　七四三　一四一〇　八二六　三九九〇</p>
<p>共計人數　二〇五八　二七七八　三三四六　六六六三　三八二八　一八六七三</p>
<p>每家平均人口　四·七九　四·七八　四·五〇　四·七三　四·六三　四·六八</p>
<p>（二）普通農塲面積在上面我們用各鎭鄕間民國二十三年的共計戶數，除二十三年的耕地總面積，可知秣陵鎭每個農家平均有地一二·四畝，孝陵鄉一五·二畝，仁陵鄉一二·七畝，信陵鄕八·〇畝，愛陵鄉七·九畝，一鎭四鄕總平均一〇·四畝·惟在我們的調査表上，原意要明瞭宮地大部農家，實際能種土地若干畝。囚之用「本村最普通的農塲大小有幾畝一詢問，希望這衆數的答案，能代表一般專實，而比平均數較爲準確。調査結果，除孝陵鄉面積稍大，有一九·一畝外，其他都在一五畝左右。一鎭四鄕平均慬一五·九畝，詳情見下表：</p>
<p>附表（二）</p>
<p>江蘇江寗一鎭四鄉每家平均之普通農塲面積數（民國廿四年調査）</p>
<p>鎭鄉名稱　秣陵鎭　孝陵鄉　仁陵鄉　信陵鄉　愛陵鄉　總計</p>
<p>調查村莊數　一一　一四　二一　二六　一七　八九</p>
<p>普通農場面積總計　一七四　二六七　三二四　三八四　二六四　一四一三</p>
<p>每家平均農場面積　一五·八　一九·一　一五·四　一四·八　一五·五　一五·九</p>
<p>附表（一）每個農家平均有四·六八人，而上表的農塲面積，每家不到一六畝。且就平均數言，每家只有一〇·四畝。就這數字的比較，讀者即可知當地人口和土地的失調問題，何等嚴重了且由此失調結果，影響農民的生活，更爲顯著。這項材料待分析就緒，當另行發表，以佐印證。</p>
<p>（六）尾語江寗縣一鎭四鄉的人口壓力日趨嚴重，整個的土地面積不敷耕種，這是形成當地農村經濟的衰落，農民生活的艱難之最大原因！且可墾的土地日見减少，而人口的增加正屬方興未艾，長此以往，未來憂患更深！</p>
<p>作者在民國二十三年聞，曾用通信方法，調査察哈爾等二二省六〇年來人口和耕地增减的趨勢。結果人口增加指數計一三一，而土地增加指數僅一〇一；（見中央農業實騐所出版之農情報告）和上列江寗縣一鎭四鄉的調査，有殊途同歸的趨勢。我們認爲這種當前的可怕專實，國人應速猛醒！如何把增加人口數量的目光，轉移到人口品質改進的路途上去，實是當務之急。他若改良農業，增加生產，也是地地問題上的重要事項。要完成這項偉大使命。初步工作，當在促起全國人士對這危機有充分的認識，則負社會敎育之實者，更有努力加工的必要。</p>

<h3 id="c67">小學教育的效率與方法 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 教育部科長吳研因</p>
<p>敎育好比是製造，受敎育的人好比是工品。製造的人，總希望製造出優良的工品來，主持敎育的人，也總希望敎育出理想的國民或是人才來。要製造出優良的工品來，必得要有好的方法，就是在經濟的原則上，要用最經濟的方法，求得最大的效率。敎育的施行也是如此　一定要用最經濟的方法，求得最大的效率。所以效率和方法是常常相關着，連帶着的。單想獲得最大的效率而不講方法，往往暗中摸索，把人力丢在無代價的犧牲中，所謂「事倍功半，」「吃力不討好；」單求方法的變化，而顧效率的增進，往往所得到的是空虛，是表面，也是「吃力不討好。」因此，方法和效率應當要並重，並且要使他們成爲正比例的關係。</p>
<p>方法是整理事物，組織事物，達到認識某種事物的必要條件。要是沒有方法，對於事物的認識，就不淸楚，不正確，這是論理學上吿訴我們的常識。在敎育上，方法也是一樣的重要，杜威說」方法是敎育上經濟的順序。「敎育有了目標，我們就得運用最經濟的方法去達到他。</p>
<p>方法在小學教育上，尤其重要。因爲小學敎育的對象是兒童，兒童好比一片未經開墾的園地，這片園地的土質怎麽樣適宜于種植那一種植物？應當多施那一種肥料？樣樣得經過一番的調査，觀察和試騐。不單如此，因爲兒童的智力體力還沒有發育完全，後天的經騐智識還沒有豐富，所以敎導兒童，尤其應當注重方法。</p>
<p>我們中國近幾十年來的小學敎育，起初是不講方法的。那時，都市裏的一般小學，和現在大多數的鄕村小畢一樣，一點也不講究方法，只知道對兒童灌輸，注入，强迫記憶，一天到晚死讀書；兒童畢業以後，只得到一點書本上的知識，和他的生活技能毫無關係，毫無作用。這種敎育，因爲沒有方法，所以也一點沒有眞正的效率。</p>
<p>固然，升學也是升的，就業也是就的，但是那時造就的國民或是人才，肩不能挑担，手不能提籃，仍舊只是些好像從科舉出身的士大夫，準士大夫，對於國家社會沒有多大的益處。民國元年以後，我們在蘇州的江蘇省立第一師範附屬小學辦事，因爲兪子夷先生等提倡，才漸漸講起敎學方法來。但是勢力太孤了，在那時的第一師範附屬小學，所有許多試行的新方法，往往被人家訕笑，說是翻新花樣，地方小學幾乎相戒不跟我們往來·後來，南京髙等師範成立，有一批留美敎育的學生回國做敎員，大大的提倡新敎育；南髙改爲東南大學後，提倡的聲浪更加髙，第一師範附屬小學跟東南大學附屬小學，才被人家稍稍重視了，認爲是新敎育的策源地。杜威來華以後，新敎育的呼聲，更是「甚囂塵上」，於是江蘇一帶活動的小學敎員，就都努力在方法上講求，所謂「設計敎學法啦」，「道爾頓制啦」，「個別教學法啦」，以及什麽「協動敎學法啦」，各就標新立異，以新方法號召了。當時，研究敎學方法的書籍，也好像雨後的春笋一樣，出版得很多：例如敎育方法原論啦，學習心理啦，敎育心理啦，課程論啦，兒童論啦，眞是不少，小學敎材的兒童化，大衆化，小學補充讀物的激增，各種教育問題的科學實騐，都是在這時期發現的。這不能不說是我國小學敎育上的一個最進步的時期。可是這又好像合上了「凡事有利必有弊」的一句老話。有許多小學，因爲方法變得太多了，而效率的增進，却也平常得很，並且像玩把戲一樣，確實有只變花樣不講實際的。例　個個學校施行設計敎學法，可是「戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同」，結果，却是空疏，浮薄，徒然浪費了許多數學時間。國民黨成功（？）以後，各校固然也有仍舊硏究敎學方法的；可是效率旣未顯然，一班新分子偏又百不相信，以爲教育方法也在反革命被革命之列；因此，囂囂然只聽見大駡「興趣論」，大駡「敎育無結果」，大駡「只會摹倣美國」，大駡「沒有中心思想」，大駡「只知兒童本位，忘了民族本位（？）」，甚至大駡「鳥言獸語」，大駡「學校不及私塾好」。主張復古，主張讀三宇經，主張讀經，總而言之。眞所謂「動輒得咎」。空氣如此，方法也自然消沉起來。到了經濟破產的尖銳化，會考抽考的提倡，督藥的注重査閱課卷以來，小學更變成了只求出品快而形式好看的工塲，能够早畢業，考及格，逃避得督學的指責，就算在教育上巳得到了相當的效率。試問這種效率，和淸末初期的敎育效率有甚麼兩樣呢？我們只消把現在的敎育的效率，來跟我國小學敎育的目標來對照一下，就可以立刻分曉。我國小學敎育的目標，在敎育部頒佈的課程標準裏分析得明白：第一，要　育兒童健康的體格；第二，要陶冶兒童良好的品性，第三，要發展兒童審美的興趣；第四，要增進兒童生活的知能；第五，要訓練兒童勞動的習慣；第六，要啟發兒童科學的思想；第七，要培養兒童互助團結的精神；第八，要養成兒童愛國愛羣的觀念。我們現在來看兒童受敎育的結果，除了品性精神很不容易看出外：一，據上海市，南京市的體格檢査，結果，在校兒童，百分之八十以上有疾病，可見兒童的體格並不康健。或許反而因爲太注重讀書，加多了駝背近視眼也未可知。二，一天到晚做紙片上的工作，把美術音樂勞作，也丢在腦後；審美的興趣，沒有發展；生活的技能，沒有增進；勞動的習慣，沒有養成；科學的思想，更加無從說起。至於愛國愛羣的觀念，似乎比以前增進些，但是這不能完全歸功於敎育，只能說是近幾年來外力加緊壓迫的結果。要知道小學敎育的目標，不是靠平日考試的成續優良，升學錄取的多數，可以算是到達的；這些效率，充乎其量，不過是知識的獲得，而這種知識，是否是生活所必需，也還是一個疑問呢。</p>
<p>敎育要講效率，必須從最經濟的方法中，去求得最大的效率。但是我們怎麽樣判別方法的經濟與否效率的大與不大呢？這裏我再來申說一下：</p>
<p>小學敎育的方法，第一要根據心理學。心理學吿訴我們的是精神生活的現象。這種現象的產生，都不是偶然的，而是和先天的遺傳，與後天的環境有關係的。先天的遺傳，在心理學上，固然不被現在一般敎育家所重視，但是智力的差別，與遺傳還是有很大的關係的。例如低能兒跟白痴，大多因爲他的父母，或祖先患了梅毒或神經病而遺傳所致的；敎育者要是不明白這一點，不調査淸楚這一點，誤把平常兒童當作低能兒或白痴，那末敎學的方法，便會走入歧途，便是不經濟。環境在敎學的方法上，尤爲重要：對鄕村的小孩子講汽車電車，又沒有模型給他們看，給他們試騐，講了一大堆，也許還楚莫名其妙。對都市兒童講耕田耘草，不去實地觀察，實地工作，即使口講指畫，形容盡致，兒童也會莫名其妙。使兒童莫名其妙，是浪費兒童的心力，也是大不經濟。</p>
<p>心理學又吿訴我們，心理發育的順序，是刺激和反應的關聯·因此，我們應當根據了兒童心理的發育，給他們以適當的刺激。例如敎低年級兒童認字，在不懂兒童心理學的人，只知道把單字敎兒宣讀寫；可是這種方法是不容易發生效率的，强迫兒童記憶，結果還是遺忘。這樣，就是不經濟。心理學告訴我們：兒童的思想是整個的，認識新事物，要利用舊經騐。例如敎兒童識字，敎師不必先用敎科書，可以呌一則有趣味的故事或事實，然後敎師再把故事中的重要材料，綴成句子，寫在黑板上，使兒童認識字句，這樣兒童所認識的字句，和他所講的發生了關係，他學習起來便容易得多。我們都知道，與自己有關係的事情，總容易引起自己的注意，所以在敎材方面要切合兒童的生活·這樣就是經濟。心理學可以指示我們敎學方法的地方很多，這裏來不及一一舉出。總之，根據兒童心理的方法，才是最經濟的方法，這是不容强辯的。</p>
<p>第二，小學敎育的方法要根據生物學，生物學可以吿訴我們兒童，身心發育的順序。兒童的智力，情緒，推考力等的發展，都是有一定順序的。脆弱的腦子，經不起强烈的刺激，理解不豐富的兒童，推考力當然很薄弱·所以兒童期不會了解文言文，不會懂得經史子集上的大道理。兒童體格還沒有發育完全，不能呌他一天到晚枯坐在敎室裏。性的機能。將來一定會發達，如果不給他一點性的知識，將來反足以誤入岐途。所以敎育者又一定要懂得生物學。從生物學的研究而了解兒童，善用方法，這也就是最經濟的方法，這裏有一個附帶的說明：就是心理學是根據生物學而發展的，過去把生物學包括在心理學裏面，近幾年來，才把他們分開來硏究。所謂實騐心理學，就是生物學上的一件大工作。</p>
<p>第三，小學敎育的方法，要根據科學的實騐。方法的改良，在乎實騐，而實騐更要有科學的方法。不迷信古人，也不做人選何權威的政隸，對於一切問題，都得用科學的方法來解决。例如國語敎學法，朗讀和默讀那一種快？背誦和理解那一種有用？檢査字典，部首和號碼那一種便利？我們都可以用科學的方法來實騐，求得他的結果，然後施行，那末敎學的效率，也自然可以增加。用科學的方法，也就是最經濟的方法。</p>
<p>至於要考査小學敎育的效率，我們也有兩種科學來做根據，（一）要根據敎育學，（二）要根據社會學。敎育學和社會學，都可以吿訴我們敎育的應有的目標。心理學和生物學好比船上的舵和櫓，牠可以使船向左右轉灣，向前進行，敎育學和社會學，好比是船上羅盤針，牠可以指示船行的方向。敎育學又是根據社會學而發展的。怎麽的社會，就有怎麽的敎育學產生。現在中國是一個甚麽社會？我們中國的敎育究竟應當根據甚麽而釐訂目標？這是關心社會硏究社會的人都知道的，我也不多說了。</p>
<p>目標跟效率，固然不能混爲一談。但是目標是一枝尺，他可以尺量效率的多少。所以我們要談教育的效率，就得用目標做尺度。</p>
<p>小學教育是一種初步的教育，他的對像又是未成熟的兒童。所以一面要顧敎育的效率，一面要講求敎育的方法。否則但求效率而沒有方法，眞是「緣木求魚」；反之，但講方法而不講效率，也是「盲人瞎馬」，所以效率與方法是分不開的·最後我再重複的說，「敎育要用最經濟的方法，獲得最大的效率」。</p>

<p>振興紗廠總理趙德雄，交遊甚廣，爲商業鉅子。當民國六年歐戰爆發之時，顏料來源缺乏，供不應求，而趙德雄適在內地經營染坊業，平時目光敏銳，曾積購巨景靛靑，乃乘機脫售，立獲巨利，德雄自暴富後，全眷遷滬，鳩工建厦，聯絡當地名流，復以報效軍費之關係，與李雪園將軍訂結金蘭之好，李將軍當時權勢在手，凡事皆得心應手，德雄得其臂助，遂以實業救國之說，號召於衆，創辦振興紗廠，果然以經營得法，業務日形發達，於是由一廠增至二廠而至於三廠四廠五廠矣。惟自歐戰告終後，外僑重復來滬，投資競爭，日益劇烈，國貨工業，俱遭打擊，華商紗廠受害尤烈，趙德雄雖努力掙扎，卒因李將軍已解甲下野，金融界各謀自衛，遂致捉襟見肘，德雄有戚可之，追隨多年，頗忠於事，近可之携欵北上，採購什糧，希圖孤注一擲，期挽旣倒狂瀾，忽其地烏雲變色，可之且死於難，於是整個計盡，慘遭失敗，趙德雄歷年刺激過深，以致瘋狂而自殺焉。且傳趙德雄自殺原因不一，交際花周繯麗小姐爲其英文秘書，亦不無關係，總之，情節曲折，極盡纏綿悱惻之能事，爲大好之劇本材料也。</p>

<h3 id="c86">實業部　振興工商辦法　咨請市府施行 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>實業社云、實業部鑒於國內工商業日趨衰落、爲謀振興起見、業經訂定標本兼施方法、實行統制貿易、提倡國貨及節約運動、已通咨本市市政府切實施行、以資復興國民經濟、茲將辦法分述於後、</p>
<p>統制貿易　該部鑒于國內經濟組織未臻健全、工商業日趨衰落、救濟之道、着重貿易統治、减少現金外溢、擬定統制貿易辦法、分爲三步驟、（一）修改關稅則、提高進口稅則、防止舶來品賤價傾銷、免使本國工商業深蒙損害、（二）輸出統制與健全工商業之組織、由國家根據市塲供需情形、管理貨品產製之數量、價格品質、求合于國外市塲之條件、同業間應謀共同合作、金融互助、及免去無謂競爭、更應有健全之組織、補救營業上之弱點、出口貿易、應漸求不必假手于外商、（三）輸入限制、我國目前危境、爲各國所共見、人民購買力减退、輸入貨物、亦必逐漸减少、設不幸中國經濟呈最後總崩潰、各國對華商業、亦必同歸于盡、輸入限制、如能實行、使國內經濟、得以恢復、則各國在華商務、得益亦多、共同繁榮、互相利賴、</p>
<p>提倡國貨　該部以提倡國貨運動、施行已久、未能發生深鉅之效力、其重要原因、（一）係受苛捐雜稅及國內災荒影響、（二）因國民缺乏愛國心、今後應求、（一）切實廢除苛雜、以解除生產事業之束縛、各地政府、雖因財政困難、未能澈底裁免苛雜、但于民間生產事業、不能發達、工商業與財政、同陷末路、應監督地方官吏、注重减輕商民負担、（二）國民愛國心之激發、關係至鉅、堅强擁護國家計劃之精神、犧牲個人之享受、購用國貨、以促國貨之發達、</p>
<p>節約運動　該部復以國家與人民經濟、當貧困之時、應减少消費、以挽危難、現國內工商業、未臻發達、國民生活稈度、日益增高、一般無法生產影響失業者、不可勝計、但都市人民、習于服用洋貨、消費擴張之結果、使多數金錢外溢、國內貨物出品、因銷路疲滯、一蹶不振、亟應提倡國、民節約運動、實行自製自給、减少外貨入超、以挽救國民經濟之崩潰云、</p>

<p>— LouisaM.Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>那天下午他們眞好快樂，雖然也出了不少的亂子，這些也正是那種長征隊所常有的！當然，韜摩又闖了禍，他跌倒在一個大黄蜂的窠上，被它們猛刺了；可是他因慣受這些苦楚，因此頗能忍受，直到　恩提起用些濕泥，這才减少了他不少的痛苦。小梅瞧見一根蛇，立刻奔跑逃遁，因此跌了一半野苺；後來小橋來帮助着她再摘滿了，同時以他廣傳的知識談論着爬蟲，內達從樹上翻了下來，他背心後面的中間完全脫了綫，可是幸而還沒有遭着其他的破裂。愛絲和解客相互爭着某一塊繁茂的去處，正是相持不下的時候，太腓却不聲不響敏捷地將一切席卷而去，急急跑到唐恩的身邊以求庇護。其時　恩也正是快樂得很，拐杖已丢在一邊，在大草原上儘自徜徉，好不自在，自己也不知道他脚裹乃已有這麽多的力，並且見到草原上星羅棋佈了有趣的磐石和樹根，有許多熟識的小動物在草地爬行，更有不少的昆蟲在空氣中跳舞。</p>
<p>可是那天下午最驚心動魄的事，莫過於南恩與羅勃的遭遇，這件事後夾也就成了梅莊常常談到的家庭掌故，歷久而猶爲人所津津樂道南恩旣已遍探了那個區域，在她的外衣上遭着了三處的破損，又在一處荊棘上抓破了她的臉兕，然後開始去采苺實，這些在矮綠叢樹上，亮晶晶黑漆漆，却如大顆珠子一般。她伶的手指儘自在上面飛趕做去，可楚她的籃子一時不易盛滿，因此她東奔西掩去找尋更好的去處，不像小梅那般肯安安靜靜地摘着。羅勃却儘自跟隨着南恩，因爲她蓬勃的精神較之他姨表姊忍耐的工作，更適他的脾氣，幷且他也是急切想要爲「媽爾媽爾」揀選那最大最好的菜莓的。</p>

<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>人家說：「救救中學生」。我說：更應該「救救孩子」！</p>
<p>請看一看中國的成年人吧，不是膽小如鼠，便是習於苟安，不圖振作。西洋人歡喜探險，歡喜乘輕氣球飛上同溫層，但在中國是聽不到這一類科學探險的消息的，就有，也不過在西藏等處充一下西洋人的嚮導或助手而已。怎樣會弄到這般地步的？我的答案是：在孩子時候便給不懂教育原理的父母嚇瞻小了。</p>
<p>這事實到現在還沒有改變，即父母（多數是母親）為哄騙小孩子入唾，一定總說：「聽！豺狼來了，老虎來了，乖寶寶。快點睡著罷！「同時更由父母或其他的人在黑暗中摹擬出一種狼或虎的吼聲，「小孩子一經恐嚇，便睡著了，尤其在孩子哭的時候，這種方法運用得最多。</p>
<p>一次兩次還不要緊，久而久之，在兒童的心理上，便會發生一種嚴重的影響。在有形方面說：成年人的不敢夜行，怕入荒僻的深山，那種懷有戒心的怯弱態度，無疑在孩子時候已被養成了。在無形方面說：則國人整個的畏首畏尾，缺乏一種堅毅的戰　姿態，和孩子時候的教育，怕也不會沒有關係吧？</p>
<p>在全國兒童年賓施委員會開幕不久的現在，謹提出這一微細的，但也有著相當重要性的問題，促請教育家以及為人父母者的注意。</p>

<p>— 汪敏</p>
<p>小朋友們：歷史上像司馬光擊缸救溺，文彥博灌水取球，這一類聰明的孩子的故事，你們歡喜多知道一些麼？這裏，讓我再來介紹幾個。</p>
<p>後漢時黃琬，他的祖父名瓊，是魏郡大守。一年，逢著日蝕，皇太后便間黃瓊：「蝕了多少？１１黃瓊卻沒知道日蝕的形狀，一時便回答不來。黃琬那時祇有七歲，他卻和黃瓊說：「就說蝕剩的太陽，和初生的月亮差不多，那就對了。」黃瓊照他的話，奏了上去，果然皇太后非凡稱贊。</p>
<p>楊修，他才九歲，孔融到他家裹，他父親拿著楊梅出來，孔融和他說：「這是你們家裏的果子呀。」他回答孔融：「倒沒聽見孔雀是先生的家禽。」</p>
<p>南唐李後主的宰相徐鉉，十歲時光，已經會做文章。有一天，他在做秋聲詩，沒一忽兒便做成了。唐朝的李賀，裴敬，七歲也能做文章的。</p>
<p>晉朝的王戎，才六七歲，在路旁和小孩子遊戲，看見李樹上　子結得根多，小孩子們都去　食，王戎卻獨個兒不採。有人問他：「為什麼不歡喜探食？」他說：「樹在路旁結果很多，一定是苦李。」採李的小孩子們，食之果然。</p>
<p>漢朝的張湯，幼時，他的父親是長安丞，一天，他父親出外，叫張湯守著屋裹，有一塊肉卻給老鼠倫竊了去，他父親疑心是他偷吃，把他打了一頓。後來他掘穴，把老鼠促了出來，又發現了老鼠偷去的餘肉。他就一個　坐堂宣判，把老鼠當做囚犯，一切設施，很像老吏模樣。</p>

<p>— 榕</p>
<p>在一天的早晨，小明獨個兒的坐在桌旁吃著早餐，桌子上放著什麼海蜇哪，油條哪，肉鬆哪，他覺得海蜇的味見好而又鬆脆，但是他不懂它是什麼，吃好了粥，便去問他的哥哥小聰：「聰哥，剛才我吃粥的時侯，小盆中的小菜，叫什麼名字，」小聰想一想道：」「噢，這叫做海蜇，產在我國的東南沿海一帶，它全部可分上下兩部，上部是扁圓而闊的肉貿，色是白的，表面很光滑，中央凸起成傘狀，質地鬆脆，這叫做蓋部：下部叫做柄部，是粗而長，並且有兩面分叉的肉質，你剛才早餐時吃的海蜇，是它的皮，叫做海蜇皮，還有別種在海中所產的束西很多，現在我告訢你幾種：</p>
<p>一、石首魚：也叫黃魚，因為它的頭像石頭一樣的堅硬，所以叫做石首，它的牙齒尖利而細硬，口在頭的前面，肚子裏有魚鰾，鰾能漲縮，收的時候，身體就沈下，漲的時候，身體就浮上了，它的鰭和鯽魚的鰭略同，但它的尾鰭不分叉，像圓形，它有臀鰭，胸鰭，腹鰭，脊鰭，尾鰭，臀鰭和脊鰭使身體平穩，胸鰭和腹鰭是撥水前進，尾鰭當然用在轉灣時候，它的肉很鮮美，並且可以乾製。</p>
<p>二，海參，它的身體似圓筒形，肉質柔軟而厚，它的口在身體的前端，而它的背部，有很多高低不平的肉瘤。它的肉也可以吃，而且它的口旁有許多的小片，叫做觸手，是捕食用的，它還可以乾製，運銷到各地，在新年我們吃的暖鍋中放著一種黑褐色的東西，就是海參的乾製。</p>
<p>三，珊瑚，它住在暖海中，身體時常搖動，遇著可以食的比它較水動物就用口旁的八雙小觸手捕食，它的組織極簡單，只有一個囊，就是它的體腔和胃腸，所以做叫腔腸，我們平日所見的是珊瑚樹，便是珊瑚虫的骨骼，可以做各種戒指，鈕扣，簪珠等裝飾品，非常的美麗，紅色白色瑪瑙色都有，價錢並不貴，出產也根多。</p>

<p>— 西霞小學六年級生劉幗英</p>
<p>敏兒是農家的見子，他家裏本來是一個很快樂的家庭，而且他的父母也很喜歡他。可是在他九歲的時候，他的母親死了。自從他母親死後，他覺得很不快樂，時常悲傷流淚。不久他父親又娶了一個後母，非常可惡：有一天父親出門，他後母時常打他或罵他，還時常叫他做根難的事情。敏兒因為年紀很輕，所以不會做，於是他的後母就重重的打他。他又想到親娘的慈愛，就到前母墳上去哭了許久，回家時，夭色已晚了。他的後母又把他打得皮開肉爛，動也不會動。後來由一個很忠的老僕人，把他抱到　上，請醫生替他醫治，他的傷雖已治好，可是他仿驀每日被後母當奴隸一般看待。直到他父親回來時，知道了這些事，於是把後母趕出。從此以後他的父親再也不娶了。</p>

<p>到熟識的一家浴堂裏去洗浴，覺得有些兒兩樣了。</p>
<p>仔細－看，啊！一切都是照常，並沒有什麼變動，不過，招待客人的堂倌，卻由成人而改變為兒童了。</p>
<p>我非常好奇，也非常痛心！於是便在浴罷之餘，就和一個小堂倌，開始聞談起來。</p>
<p>他說：『今年還祇十五歲，是揚州人，幼年時，也曾讀過三四年書，後來因為家境困難，書就不讀了。在田裏幫助家長種田，現在鄉下種田也難了！收成又不好，於是　　　　　介紹　　　　　做這種生活，到上海才不久，祇有半個月呢！』說罷，仍舊跑了開去，招呼別的客人，做沖茶絞手巾，捏腳……等等工作。</p>
<p>我聽了這小堂倌的話，不禁默然者久之，我想：今年不是兒童年嗎？兒童年的使命，是要替一般兒童謀幸福的，現在，兒童的幸福在邢裏？應該受教育的兒童，而沒有得到受教育的機會，這是兒童的幸福嗎？像這種孩子，能夠在浴堂裏混一口飯吃，已稱大幸，其餘還有成千成萬流浪在街頭上的兒童，受飢餓，受寒凍，往宿無定所，這又是一個多麼嚴重的問題？</p>
<p>救救孩子們吧？注意兒童幸福的先生們！</p>

<p>— 失</p>
<p>小朋友你們看見過水面的油麼？油是一種液體，為什變能浮在別種液體上面，這不是一件很覺得奇怪的事麼？，不，並不奇怪！祇要我們細心的去察看，就不雖明暸了。</p>
<p>大凡一種東西，我們要知道能否在水面上升浮，第一個條件，我們要看這種東西，在水裹是否要溶解。比如，我們拿一塊鹽，放到水裏，立刻就不見了，這是起了溶解的作用。油的性質與此不同，它在水裏不但不起溶解作用，而且此同容積的水量輕得多，所以能夠浮在水面上。</p>

<p>（三）圖書怎樣印成的</p>
<p>小朋友們也許要問我，那麼書上的圖盡、是怎樣印成的呢？</p>
<p>是的，這是一個值得研究的問題。書上的圓畫，有的是用鋅版，有的是用銅版印成的。也有的是用石印印成的。</p>
<p>鋅版和銅版，普通多附在鉛字澆成的鉛版中印刷。製鋅版的方法，先用字畫原稿，用照相機攝影在濕片上，再印在光潔的鋅版上，把不要的一部分，用藥水爛去，就成。至於銅版的製法，也和製鋅版相仿，所不同的，拍照的時候，加一層網綿這綱線是由大小不同的小圓點組成的。而把網線的字畫，印在鋼版上。</p>
<p>上面所講的，只能限於印一種　色，普通所說的單色印刷。如果要印美麗的彩色，那要利用石印了。石印的手續，先把字畫的原稿，分列幾種顏色，用汽水墨鉤成線條，每色一張，把他覆在塗過藥水，而磨得很光滑的石板上。（圖四）這石板上沒有墨的部分，因為經過藥品的揩試，所以不會吸收墨油，有汽水墨畫過的部分，就能吸收墨油，那就可以稱心如意的印刷起來。每一套色，照此費一次手續。所以他的成本，要比較昂責得多。普通書中美麗的彩色圖，和市上出售的畫片，月份牌，都是用這樣方法印成的。</p>
<p>近來印刷術更加發明，有珂羅版，有照相版，他們印刷出來，和真品一式無二，並且不會變色，那更是文化界的幸福呢！</p>
<p>圖一）的字畫，是用鋅版印成的，（圖二）的字畫，是用銅版印成的。（圖三）所示的，就是放大的網線。</p>

<p>— 禧</p>
<p>一個單身漢住在這樣的一所客店中，是何等的難受呀！我要打算找尋我的同類，要求他們收留我下來。但是我想：「到了晚上，一切的烏類都是灰色的，看不出那一個是我的同類；況且陲在他們的旁邊，也許有些不方便吧？」</p>
<p>我先就向著一條溝渠中飛去，見有許多歐掠烏聚在那裹。他們正很當心的理著晚妝，我瞧他們都是金色的翅勝和光亮的腳爪多麼美麗；他們是森林中的花花公子。他們雖很和善，但是並不注意於我。他們所談講的話，全是空虛而沒有意義的，有的在講他們和人爭吵的話；和追求異性的情形：瞧他們又　又自大，使人真受不了，因此我再也不能留在這裏了。</p>
<p>「當下我去棲止在一根樹枝上，見有五六頭不同類的烏排列在那裏0我很謙卑的停住在樹枝的梢上，希望他們能夠容許我在此過宿。可是很不幸的，那和我貼鄰的是一頭老斑鳩，乾枯得好像屋頂上的一頭指示風的風雞。當我挨近伊時，伊假做在那裏整理伊的一身稀蔬的羽毛，生怕拔下一根來似的。我偶不經心，將我的翅尖碰了伊一下，伊就昂然的挺起身來，鼓著伊的嘴說道：「先生，你是甚麼意思？」接著將伊的肘兒猛撞著我，頓把我撞了下來。</p>
<p>我跌倒在一堆灌木叢中，見有一頭胖胖的母的山　正安睡著。我的母親雖長得很胖，但也不像伊這樣發福的模樣兒，我偷偷地爬到伊的身邊，一面對自己說道：「伊一定不會驚醒的即使醒了過來，那麼像伊這樣一位好好的胖媽媽，也未必會惱我吧。」那知事實上並不如此。伊半張眼睛，微微地吐了一口氣道：「孩子，你來打擾我了！快快的滾開去！」</p>
<p>同時我聽得有誰在呼喚我：原來在一株山梨樹的頂上，有幾頭畫眉招呼我過去。我暗暗的想道。「我在這裏，終於碰見幾個好朋友了。伊們勝出地位來，讓我停留，像發瘋一般的笑著！，我撲著翅兒，直飛到伊們的中間。但我停留不久，就瞧到這幾位太太，吃下了太多的葡萄，肚子漲得高高的，連那些樹枝也幾乎載不起來，加著伊們那種乏味的頑話，瘋狂的笑聲，和輕薄的歌唱，都使我不得不飛了開去。</p>
<p>我開始失望了，就打算在一筒幽靜的壁角裏安睡一下吧。這當兒卻有夜鶯唱起歌來，一時大家靜默了，咦！他的聲音是何等的清朗，在憂鬱中卻覺得何等甜蜜呀！他的歌聲不但是不會打擾人家的安睡，并且好像是一支催縱曲，使人安然的入睡。沒有人打算去喝住他，也沒有人抱怨他在這深夜裏唱著歌；他的父親決不會責打他，他的明友們聽了歌聲，也決不會飛逃開去。</p>

<p>——四全大會至五全大會間——</p>
<p>五全代表大會，已於上月二十三日閉幕，集群曲於一堂，決國策於衆議，用以檢閱過去，策勵來茲，精誠團結，救亡圖存，在此一舉，誠盛事也，伏讀大會宣言，樸實無華，語語沉痛，指陳今後應行努力之點，切中時弊。其第四項第二目，乃為發展交通以裕經濟。夫交通事業，為國家脈絡，而電信為其神經系。茍脈絡停動，則失其生命性，茍神經不靈，則失其知覺性，知覺失則與無生命無異焉。故神經係統，為人類思想之靈機，而電信系統，為國家行政之樞紐是已。交通部近來年對這個問題民信事業之改進，種種事實，迭在本刋發表，昭昭在目，無待贅述。惟自四全大會至五全大會，時間已歷四年，電信建設與整理之成績若何？亟須以簡明之統計數字以表明之，以資比較，而知有所取鑑焉。</p>
<p>就以上各表觀之，除人員與債務外，均有相當之增加。換言之：消耗費已儘量減低，而事業範圍則及各有增加也。查電信事業‘雖屬國營，並未由國庫補助，全係以電養電」「以電設電」本身上着手辦理，而每年約五百萬之官軍電欠費，未能收到。且自國難發生，天災人禍，相逼而來，農村破產，市塲緊縮，電信營業，細然受其影響。故電政經濟在此環境下，極端困難！雖有種種計劃，不能如期現實。然電政當局，在無可設法之中，以苦幹硬幹精神，克服一切難關，向前猛進，數年以來，已立定基礎，而得社會同情。若能本此精神，加倍努方，至六全代表大會時，當更有慰否人之望也。</p>

<p>— 清華</p>
<p>電碼新編一書，在民國十八年以前，祇有坊間印售之本，內容旣極簡陋，錯誤更屬不免。且坊間印售之電碼新編，目的祇在圖利，紙張脆薄，不耐久用，印刷粗劣，有損目力，間或附載各項電報章程，往往謬誤百出，或早經廢止，或業已修正補充，閱之反足滋生誤會。交部有鑒及此，故於十八年十月間由部刋行電碼新編一種，用堅厚之道林紙印刷，附載正確之電報規則及局台名稱斗定價極廉，每本祇收回成本一角。是書出版後，社會稱便。迨二十二年八月間，交部以該編存書售罄，乃重編付印，內容大加改良，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）電碼改用阿剌伯數目字排印舊本電碼用漢字排印，如七一九三，現改為7193，與電局來去報底上所書電碼，完全相同，翻譯電碼時較前便利。</p>
<p>（三）常用字放大電碼新編內共有九千餘字，但電報中常用之字，不過二三千字，為便利查檢起見，特將常用字用大號字排印，以資醒目而便查檢。</p>
<p>（三）同部之字加註畫數　同一部首內有字數甚多者，如水部木部金都等，在該部內尋檢一字，有時住往須費一二分鐘之久，極感困難，茲為便於尋檢起見，特仿照字典分畫辦法，在每行之下加註畫數，以便查得部首後，按照畫數檢字，免費時問。</p>
<p>（四）添加難字易檢表我國文字組織複雜，部首不明之字為數頗多，如祇賴部首表檢字，仍不免發生困難，故特將部首不明較難尋之字，按照每字筆畫多寡，依次排列，凡遇部首疑難之字，可計算談字畫數，在此表內一查卽得，電碼同時印入該表，故查得該字時，卽知電碼為何，不必再查正編內之電碼。</p>
<p>（五）添加四角號碼難字檢查表凡遇部首不明之字，可計算畫數，利用「難字易檢表」尋查，業於上節內述及，但漢字字體，有古體正體草體俗體之別，計算畫數時，往往因習於俗體或草體字，以致所計畫數並不華確，於是在該表內仍不能立時檢得，例如「享」字從正體則為八畫，從俗體（享）則為九畫，故為更求尋檢便利起見，特將難檢各字按照四角號碼排列，則困難可以減少矣！</p>
<p>（六）必增添需用之字一八三惆　近數年來電報應用之範圍漸廣，故需添之字甚多，此次編印時，經審核內加一百八十三個新字，並為查考便利起見，特另編「新添字碼備考表」附刋備查。</p>
<p>（七）刪去重複字四六個電碼新編舊本內，重複之字甚多。例如「穴」字，同見宀為部及穴部，宀部內電碼為1340，穴部內為4494，為避免重複及易於記憶電碼起見，故將同字異碼之重複字四十六個刪去，惟刪去之字之電碼，暫不補字，以免誤會，此項刪去之重複字，亦特刋、一表備查。</p>
<p>（八）用電碼代日代時　電報發出日期及時刻，向例均用韻目及時辰代替，例如一日十二點鐘則以「東午」二字代替，凡不諳韻目者，無論來去電報，均須在「韻目代日表」內尋檢一次，極感不便，茲利用剩餘之電碼，直接代替日期及時刻，自9801，至9824，代表一點至廿四點，9901至9913代表一日至三十一日。首二碼為98者係代替時刻之電碼，99者係代替日期之電碼，記憶便利，無煩查表。</p>
<p>（九）特備密碼頁數檢查表電碼新編編製密碼時，角上新編之千百位兩數碼，往往並非順序編列，先後顚倒，在翻譯來電時，找尋非常困難，為便利檢譯起見，特備一密碼頁數檢查表，表內分兩行，一行將密碼之首兩碼依次排列，一行填該密碼所在之頁數，兩相對照，查譯極為便利。</p>
<p>（十）新添羅馬字母電碼普通電碼以四個數碼組成，如發住國外，每字須照全價收費。羅馬字母電碼係以三個洋文字母組成，全電譯成此項電碼後，可接聯拼成五個字母一組之國際密碼，則每字照全價六折計算，且字數尚可減少，每電可節省報費百分之六十四，國外華僑利用之與祖國通訊，經擠上便宜殊多。</p>
<p>以上十點，為該編改良後之特色，故出版後銷售甚速，去年底卽已售馨，交部以各地商民紛紛請購，需要甚切　故又將內容大加刷新，並加附錄電政便覽，於本年八月問付印，現已出版，內容旣更豐富，印刷亦益求精良，篇輻較原來增加三分之一，聞每冊成本須合國幣三角，惟交部因該編略有廣告費收入，每冊仍售二角，以資普及。此次該編除前次已改良各點仍予保存外，又有改良各點如後：</p>
<p>（一）字碼橫排　查舊版電碼新編之字碼，係照直行排列，惟電碼旣用阿拉伯數目字，又有羅馬字母電碼，習慣上均以橫排為宜，且字碼模排後書邊所印部首及畫數，可以對照各行排列，於檢字時便利不少。又該編原來每版所排電碼，如第一版0001起至0100，第二版自0101起至0200，在翻譯來電時，如遇0100一碼，往往誤為列在第二版內，造查第二版時，始發覺該碼列在第一版內。簡言之，卽每版內所列電碼，必有一個百位不同之電碼，似不整齊，現改為第一版自0000起至0099，第二版自0100起至　0199，庶與角上所註之千百位電碼，完全符答。</p>
<p>（二）增加附錄「電政便覽」此次出版之電碼新編，其唯一特色為增加附錄「電政便覺」，篇輻特多，共有一百五十五頁，除電報規章價目局名等均列入便覽外，新添下列二項：</p>
<p>（一）電政大事年表我國民衆對於國內電政過去之歷史，極為隔膜，國內各種刋物，亦鮮有記載電政以往情形者，故特將歷年電政過去之大事，編一年表，以供社會人士查考電政以往之陳迹，極有價值。</p>
<p>（二）電政現狀述要　我國電信事業近來來發展頗速，所有現在一般狀況，諒為國人所樂聞，茲特將目前電政現狀，撮要叙述，傳國人腦中，對於電政現狀有一概略之觀念，不致異常隔膜。又附刋全國有無綫訊重要電路簡明圖一張，以便參考。</p>
<p>（此項新出版之電碼新編，各地電報局無綫電台，均有出售，惟離首都較遠之處，寄到或稍遲，如亟欲購閱者，可逕函本社代購，每冊除實價二角外，應加郵費五分，掛號再加八分，郵票十足可代。）</p>

<p>— 雲</p>
<p>上海外商留聲機唱片公司，前因各廣播無綫電臺於播音時播送唱片，對於留聲機唱片營業影響極鉅，特根據國際唱片工業聯合會之指示，向田海無綫電墦音同業公會提出六項要求，其中最重要者，為各廣播電臺播送唱片，每日須繳納版權費一百五十元，於每月第一日付淸。上項要求，如予拒絕，採取法律行動，並謂新近英國曾有同樣訴訟發生，結果唱片公司得直等語。當時交通部得報後，以廣播無綫電臺，為促進殿箘敎育之重要工具，該部除在上海北平等處設有廣播臺外，所有全國民營廣播電臺，依法均歸該部監督。此項電臺為吸引聽衆起見，必須於各種教育節目之外，酌如娛樂節目，藉以增加興趣，而各項娛樂節目中實以播送唱片，最為簡便經濟，故對於上述外商唱片公司之要求，極為注意。惟外商方面提出上項要求時，旣稱如不照辦，旣將採取法律行動，諒係唱片，亦為出版品或著作物之一，故應享有著作權。他人如欲公開檳奏，必須先得著作人之同意，否則卽係侵害著作人之利益。洵如是則此案之先決問題，厥為依照我國現行之著作權法及出版法，究竟唱片是否可認為著作物或出版品，而且享有著作權？如能享有著作權，所有廣播電臺用無綫電播送唱片，是否須得唱片商之同意？此兩點解決，則外商唱片公司之要求是否合法，卽可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>上述問題，交通部雖經詳加研究，但因事關法律，為鄭覓起見，特正式面請司政院解釋。最近司法院函復交通部謂該案業經司法院統一解釋法令會議議決：</p>
<p>「留聲機片，旣非出版品，亦非著作物，並無專有公開演奏之權。購買人本其所有權作用，無論如何使用，卽不問共以供個人娛樂，或以供公衆收聽，應任憑其自由，出售人製造人發行人，均不得干涉」。</p>
<p>按司法院統一解釋法令會議，為全國解釋法律之最高權威。今旣如此斬釘截鐵，明白否詔留聲機唱片，為著作物或出版品，並無專有公開演奏之權，則廣播電盛播送唱片一事，在法律上可謂毫無問題矣。</p>
<h3 id="c168">話務稽查制度實行後所希望於電話用戶者 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>交通部為促進電話業務起見，曾經指定上海，天津等十數電報局業務稽查員兼任當地電話業務稽查職務。此項辦法自十月一日開始實行以來，迄今已屆兩月。據聞以兩個月來稽查結果觀之，各地電話業務弊病，約可歸納為兩部份：一部份是發生於電話局方面，另一部份是發生於話戶方面，現在特地在這里寫出來談談。</p>
<p>發生於電話局方面之弊病不外乎：（一）話局員司工役向話戶索取酒資；（二）對於話戶缺乏禮貌；（三）司機生接綫遲緩，（四）遇機件損壞時，話局修復太慢等事為最多，此等事情的確對於話戶發生不便，並有不快之感。但此等事件之發生，並非電話局所願有，僅係一部份不盡責與不忠實之員工之所為，所以電話當局，極願澈底的加以取締。但在取締之前，先得請求電話用戶切實與話局嚴密合作而後可。頗聞各地業務稽查員向話戶查詢有無上項弊病時，電話用戶願據實報告，請求查辦者固多；但閃爍其詞，含糊答復者產在不少。一般電話用戶之意，欲以「忠厚處世」，「小事化無」，深恐一經告發，當事人不免受相當處分。但同時又暗地怨懟電話業務不良。吾人對於以真情相告者，十分感謝！因為他們對於電話業務之改良給予極大的助力。至於一般已感不滿而猶隱忍本原揭發者，希望改變態度，因為電族業務不良，在用戶方面，固受莫大痛苦，而在話局方面，亦失莫大作譽，茍不據情直告，通力合作，則電話業務將永無改良之望。凡百事業，必須多方面着力，才能收效。電話事業亦須多方面着力，才有充分改進之可能。同時還要希望公衆放出制裁的力量，切莫存着前項誤解，姑息養姦！</p>
<p>幾年來，交通部無論在電報或電話方面，都在竭力改進，其目的無非為公衆謀便利，此種事實，當為社會人士所共曉。業務稽查員之設立，其主旨亦卽在此，彼等唯一任務，在求電報電話用戶與電局間之聯絡，藉以咨訪一切公衆所希望於電局之事項，歸報當局採納施行。所以用戶諸君，應徹底瞭解彼等之使命，而與之合作，如遇前述各項弊病，務請隨時切實報告，必有滿意的答復。如果經電局查明情弊確屬，對於應該負責的員司工役無不照章懲處，决無徇情不辦，或敷衍了事。如此進行，方能收懲一警百之效。</p>
<p>至於發生在電話用戶方面之弊病，不外乎：（一）話戶所報種類與實情不符；（二）私裝分機，互通機，或小交換機（三）私自移機，更名，或過戶等三項。吾人於此，不欲以道德問題與法律問題來討論，祗就電話業務所受的影響，願有所言：第一，冒報種類與私裝機件，都足以減損話局收入，妨害話局經濟。第二，私裝分機，足以增加話機負荷，減短話機壽命。第三，私移話機，每易阻斷通話，苟萬一稍涉疏忽，而誤觸電燈綫，則用戶受害，更不堪設想。第四，私自更名或過戶，足以擾亂電話交換之正確性，召致其他用戶之責難，凡此種種，皆予話務莫大之不利也。</p>
<p>查電話業務稽查開辦以來，雖僅兩月，而各地查出上項弊病，已有多起。均經各地話局呈明交部按照市內電話營業章程，分別切實取締，或罰欵補費，或撤機停話。深恐各地電話用戶仍有不明情形暗中取巧老，故特寫出，俾知警惕，希望趕快自動糾正，免遭處罰。總之，欲求市內電話交通之美滿愜意，一方面固有賴於話局之維持妥善，另一方面，用戶知循守章程，愛護慶機，也是必要條件。深願用戶諸君三致意焉！</p>

<p>中央黨部宣傳委員會電影股，近為宣揚國內生產建設事業起見，特往上海各電信機關，攝製電信敎育影片一種，將有無綫電及電話等各種機械及工作情形，一一攝入，並配加有聲說明，解譯電報電話各種機械之原理及處理手續之經過，俾觀者於數十分鐘內了解電報電話之眞相。該片攝製旣竣，中宣會電影段張主任特約交通部同人前往參觀，記者以適逢其會，得窺全豹，爰將試映情形，約略述之如左：</p>
<p>試映之地點，在甫經落成之中央攝影斱，迨記者等魚貫入斱甫稍坐定，卽聞機聲軋軋作響，開始放映。銀幕旣揭，首觸於吾人之眼簾者，為吾人習見之　　，旁觀交通部電信建設及中宣會電影股攝等字樣，次為有綫電報方面各種機器動作及電報收發手續等等之表演。如莫氏機韋氏機克氏機及印字機之工作狀况，收發處如去報之收受，來報之繕對投送等等，均一一演出，異常逼眞。其中尤以收發處室報房間空氣管遞送電報悄形，用卡通畫表演其動作，最為淸晰動人。配音說明，復能恰中肯要，易於領悟。亦屬可貴，第二部份為無綫電報方面之表演，首為人工收發報機之工作情形，次為國際電臺中央收發室自動收發報機之寫眞，再次如劉行及楓林橋收報　及眞茹發報臺各部份發電機蓄電池及天綫地纜等等均一一攝入，並加簡要說明。第三部份為各式電話之表演，首為磁石式電話接綫之方法，用戶接談之情形。次為共電式電話接綫及通話之狀況，再次為自動式電話極械動作及通話接綫之表演，其他如電話局內之蓄電池測量臺發電機等等，亦均攝入，全片計長二千尺，歷時三十分鐘始畢。</p>
<p>記者於觀影之後，深覺此項電影給予吾人之印象，較任何方式為深刻，將來此片放映於各大戲院，不特交通部近來銳意革新之電信事業，得直接介紹於觀衆，而一般公衆，對於電信常識，亦藉此得以灌輸。誠社會敎育最理想之方法也。參觀旣畢，爰援筆記之。</p>

<p>— 友愚</p>
<p>一個前進的國家，須要站在時代綫上，一個前進國家的國民，亦須趕上時代，因為國民是組成國家的中堅，全是落伍的國民底國家，還能担負前進的使命嗎？電信事業走上現代化和商業化的路，事實上已是新特代必然的要求。試看歐美先進的國家，因為科學的發達，無不在現代化和商業化的目標上改革邁進。同時他們的國民對於「電報」已經和「書札」一樣的熱識而應用着，對於電報局謀公衆通信便利的種種設施，緊緊地把握住，不肯輕易地放棄這權利。</p>
<p>回顧我國近幾年來的電信交通，在國難嚴重的時期，經交通當局努力整頓與建設之下，和全國同人的澈底覺悟而埋頭苦幹，逐步實現「現代化」和「大衆化」兩句口號底實際的貢獻。但是我們的發報公衆，一向來承着傳統的觀念，提到電報，似乎一定是緊急嚴重的事故，而對於上項兩句口號的意義，並沒有充分的認識。這種錯誤的觀念，在趕上時代的途中，是必項改變過來的。</p>
<p>所以我們對於發報公衆和讀者的希望，就是每逢我們有一種新的章則或設施貢獻出來，讀者諸君，必須趕快去研究它認識它利用它！如果有不明瞭的地方，電報局或電話局的同人，是無不竭誠為之解答。譬如社交上發覺什麽事情，可以利用交際電報，再如想和他處朋友談話，儘便利用長途電話，或者在船舶航行中想與親友通信，儘可利用船舶電報，旅行中可以向中國旅行社拍發旅行電報。其他如預付回報費電報，跟送電報，分送電報，留交電報，郵轉電報，路轉電報，話傳電報等，都隨發報人的便。現在交通部採普遍的郵電合設辦法，每一處地方，都可以發寄電報或電話，更為便利。近年來電信設施上種種改革，無不以便利公衆為依歸，電信時代的進步，眞是一日千里了！</p>
<p>總之，我們希望公衆們把握住時代，深切地認識電信現代化和大衆化的意義；同時我們須更站在國際平行綫上，趕在時代的前面，替公衆們服務。</p>

<p>——節譯美國合組公司十月份報告——</p>
<p>據無錢電合組公司副經理兼總辦溫探勃登William　Ａ　Winterbuttom君，宣遠：英郵政總局之徹消意國代表在日內瓦預定之廣播演說，已引起各方對於美國自戰後無綫電信交通完全獨立之嚴重注意。合組公司組織下充分完善之收報台，得能收聽任何國家或他處之播音。凡同一事件之雙方播音，而與美國有關者，亦能收聽。如一方不克直接播發，則其他各國，必準備為其播送。上星期日，意代表阿洛鍚爵土直接由羅馬向美國廣播無綫電網播音演說一事，溫氏認為一最好之例證。因當初倫敦電台預定將阿洛錫爵士在日內瓦之廣播演說，由大西洋轉經惟屆期英郵政總局突稱該台不能供作是項演說之用。姑不論此係技術上困難之結果，抑因英國係國聯會員國受實施制裁之影響，而此項播音，仍不獲阻心美國之收聽。良以阿洛錫爵士返羅馬後，卽由其本國電台，直接向美國廣播其遲延之演說辭，此項播音，由合組公司之Riverhead電台接受，並由其按照預定辦法，分轉哥倫此亞無綫電信　。其轉播成續，異常優良。該公司曾經轉播日內瓦阿國代表乏宣言，至此又依感美國廣播政策，已將向一事件之雙方意見，公諸於世矣。</p>
<p>美國曾收聽直接由意阿二國京都意相墨沙里尼氏友阿主之播音。而於收聽阿王演說時，尤覺奇妙。因其播昔，旣發自菲洲　心地帝乏電台，而其機械，僅用不及五分之電力之新式標凖短波發射機也。</p>
<p>無綫電通信之利益，願為顯著。蓋電信符號之達到內地城鎭或海岸地帶，有同樣之便捷，旣無政治之境界，又無途次經繼電或檢查之必要，此廣遍世界之無綫電組織，不僅限於與國外各處之通信，而其廣大功效，實無遠弗屆。董藉近代無綫電通信，卽使於二十四小時內，傳出阿比西尼亞軍事行動之照片，亦屬可能也。</p>

<h3 id="c173">鐵桶堆中的人頭 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 盧迅</p>
<p>前幾天外埠某報登載著一則鐵桶壓碎車夫腦袋的新聞，說是有一家啤酒公司欲遷入新址，因捨不得化費二十幾塊錢去雇用裝運汽車，所以就由某人承包，雇老虎車（又名塌車）運送，將滿裝啤酒的鐵桶一雙隻疊上去，那知鐵桶越過塌事所能負荷的重量，致使輸軸壓斷，上面的鐵桶滾下來，將車夫的腦袋壓成「肉餅」，腦漿縷縷的濺射，那個車夫便當塲斃命。這種人問的慘案，真是目不忍睹，耳不忍聞！</p>
<p>因為車夫的腦袋是被鐵桶壓碎的，於是有人以為罪魁該是鐵桶了，因為鐵桶為什麼要那樣重呢？又有人以為老虎車的輪軸太不堅固了，肇禍的主犯該是那太耐不起重量的老虎車。甚至於也有人會埋怨著車夫自己不好，為什麼要裝那麼重的貨物，且又為什麼要幹這下賤危險的生意呢？可是這許多人都不會真正認識肇禍的主犯的。</p>
<p>不錯，車夫的腦袋是鐵桶壓碎的，但鐵桶為什麼會壓碎車夫的腦袋？我以為問題的關鍵在於該公司要節省二十幾塊大洋。以這樣的一個大公司而拾不得多化幾十元的裝運費，看來好像有點希奇，其實是沒　什麼希奇的，他們只知道如何節省成本，如何增加收入，他們從來沒有將勞工的生命安全等等打在算盤珠上。在洋塲十里的都市中，在數十萬絞著生命的血淚的勞工　中，在一批批被機輪吞滅的勞工　中，一個老虎車夫的死亡還不是恒河沙數中的一粒嗎？</p>
<p>關於車夫，人道主義者就為了人道主義而不坐人力車：善良的行政當局就為了「合理化」而限制人力車夫的數量；他們的善意都可感。但前者的人道主者，他僅僅是一隻駝烏，他將頭鑽在沙漠裏面，自以為已經躲過了一切罪惡「眼不見為淨」。後者也並沒有診斷出大眾生活的病因。</p>
<p>但是，慘案是現實的。絕自已以外的自然人的生命，謂之殺人。退－百步論，該公司乏負貴人實犯過失殺人的刑章。承包裝運者助紂為虐，藉以漁利，亦不免同謀之嫌，理合一併付之有司，治以應得之罪。如若律法有雲，這一點最低限度的保障人權的使命，總還做得到的吧！</p>

<p>——老上梅展覽會巡禮——</p>
<p>從本月二十六日起兩個星期內，上海人可以有個機會去看一看四十二年前的老上海情形了，因為圓明圓路五十五號的四層樓上正我舉行一個「老上海展覽會」。</p>
<p>上海人應　記得，今年在蒲石路蘭心大戲院，曾經由以前上海名媛唐瑛女士和她的一些外國朋友們，主演過一次穿中國古裝而用外國話說白的戲。那便是熊式一編的英語中國戲「王寶川」又名「紅　列鳥」。那些外國人中有一位　里茨太太，確是一位戲迷，又可說是最喜歡中國藝術的一個人。她意經假座虹橋路沙遜花園，開了一個盛大的茶舞會歡迎由俄歸國的伶界大王梅博士，她印的請帖非常有趣，在請帖的左上角特印一個圖案，畫著一個老旦和關公臉譜，並有IAT二字，那就是她所主持的「國際藝藝戲院」的標幟。這位太太也是最熱心擁護「老上海展覺會」而力促其成的一位發起人。</p>
<p>這個展覽會的開幕時間是二十六日下午五點十五分。它的意思是歡迎上海人每天在辦公時問以後去看。還請了一位很熟悉上海掌故的費姆博士擔任講演，講演的題目是四十二年前的上海」。費姆博士　講演的一些事情都是有詩為證的。聽了他的講演以後，還可以立刻在那展覺會裏尋到不少的證據，例如壁上掛著的圖畫，照相，地板上排列著的用具，器皿，桌子上擺著的一本一本大而厚的冊子等等。</p>
<p>參觀的人一土到四層樓，便由一位西洋小姐含笑迎上來，請除購買一張門票（怯幣一元）。進了展覽室，首先看見一塊黑版，上面用白粉筆寫些英文，不外是展覽會名稱，會期，參觀券價，圭辦會所名稱等。那間房問並不天也不高，只抵得一個普通的劇院舞臺面。居正搭了一座臺，比平地約高一英尺（費姆博士便是立在這臺上講演的）。台上橫放著一幅極大的地圖，顏色已經黝黑，而且小破壞處極多，是誰古老！近前仔細一看，原來是上海租界一百〇三年前的地圖，是法租界當局所繪製的。</p>
<p>臺的前右面一根柱子旁邊，用木架架著一個大鐘，也是古色斑斕，前面刻著「福蓮禪院」四個大字，一邊刻著光緒十九年，一邊刻著許瑞記冶坊造。據說在三十五年前，這個鐘是懸在寗波福蓮禪院的寶塔裏的，因為寶塔和廟被火燒燬，才把它運到上海來。試敲一下，聲音倒很響亮。據一個在旁招待的外國小姐說：「中國現在正在預備製造此這大十多倍的鐘，這是中國人所視為唯一的鑄金藝術吧？」記者自愧外行，不敢置答。然而九華山的夭鐘，確有不少善男信女在力促其成。而且，好像在事實上，佛教的勞民傷財也正是被稱為藝術古　的豐功偉續哩！那末，外國小姐是懂得藝術的了！</p>
<p>在台的前左而另一根柱子旁邊有一架衣櫥，完全是硃紅漆的，大約有八尺高，那紅的漆色，鮮明潔淨，確是中國代表作。在櫥的旁邊配上了一只長香几，便是舊式一點的上海人家天廳上屏門前橫列著的那種大而長的香几，在習慣上多半當中擺著一架大自鳴鐘，在邊一隻古磁花瓶，右邊一塊大理廠屏，香几之前，一張八仙桌，兩把太師椅等等。在那香几上擱著一張張的照片，這便是五十年來的上海變遷著的一些風景。在這香几對面牆邊橫擺著兩條春凳，和香几一樣的黝黑的漆，光可照人，春凳陳列處的牆上滿掛著老上海地圖，但只限於租界，從一百零三年前到五十三年前都是掛圖，從五十年前便有了很多的照相了。據記者推測，四十二年前以後的東西，系統比較好些，可以窺見對於這些材料的搜集是從四十二年前以後才特別注意起來的！</p>
<p>據老輩們說：四十二年前的上海，那時還沒有電燈，只有自來火燈，即煤氣燈。由上海到蘇州已開始有腳踏輪船及小火輪拖民船。上海有名的四馬路，那時有五層樓，青蓮閣，吹簫品玉樓等茶社。鴉片烟是公開買賣；五層樓和青蓮閣都分前後廳，前廳茶座，後廳烟鋪（用坑塌坑几）。那時候的外國人還沒有像現在那樣神氣，倒是廣東人和寗波人要比較神氣些。在老上海展覽會中，有一本怡和洋行的紀錄冊子，裏面還可尋得出外國人是給中國官廳的稟啟，上面自稱夷民，稱中國官廳官長為大人。這是在甲午之戰以前的景況，等到甲午以後（去今四十年前）便每況愈下了。</p>
<p>在那展覽會怡和洋行紀錄冊子裏，貼得有如下一張諭帖類的東西。可以看出洋商們如何神氣起來的情形。那論帖是寫明黃旗駐粵領事渣甸論：為　到黃浦艇人名三盛（是一個包工頭）隨帶水手四十名，前往××等候英國火輪船月信消息，趕　來省，仰惟沿途巡船開訊查驗後師放行，不可久阻留滯，恐有誤該公司，特立此憑信據是實。據其英文說明係丹麥駐粵領事為怡和大班　lemesMatheson　所書。一紙外籍領事的憑證，即可以通過中國開訊巡船，其事在道光二十八年已經是司空見慣的，陳列在怡和紀錄簿旁邊，那冊子裏面貼滿了照相，完全是表示上海從五十餘年前到現在些制服的改變，凡軍隊（限於工部局管轄下的）、職員以及很多　用人員等制服式樣都有。還有許多街頭巷尾的士農工商們的寫照。雖覺得雜亂一點，但在那裏也很可以看到不少老上海的風光。</p>
<p>這個會的性質，在那般主持的外國太太小姐們眼裏是多半從新奇古董方面看的；但在我們這些上梅人眼裏看來，不難尋出不少反主為奴的痕跡。我以為，凡是上海人都應當注意到這一點，並且，將來也應該由上海人自己來籌備展覽一次。</p>

<p>在哈爾濱這地方有許多特殊的行業，住在　使一個初到這裏的外路人感到驚奇的。即就賣舊皮鞋的來說罷，這種小本經營在別地決不能成為一種行業的，而在這裹所佔的商業地位卻不小，雖然他們營業的塲所並不是正式的店鋪。</p>
<p>這種賣舊皮鞋的生意，在這裏俗稱為「黑生意」；他們集合的地點道裏道外都有；以前俄人在這裏佔勢力的時代，他們的生意都很發達，現在因為住居在這裏的人大部份都不必需要穿皮鞋，所以他們也就祇有靠一部份中國人和過路的客商來光顧一點生意了。</p>
<p>賣舊皮鞋而被稱為「黑生意」，其原因便在他們營業的時問全部都在晚上，所集合的塲所又都是揀著燈光暗淡的馬路旁邊，使客人雖窮極目光也辨不出皮鞋上所有的缺點，因為這樣才能使交易易於成功。</p>
<p>哈市所包藏的這種舊皮鞋業，據說從前有五百多處，直接問接靠這吃飯的大概不下一兩萬人；現在因為營業清淡，僅存的皮鞋攤不琮三百家左右，然而較諸其他的都市，為數恐怕還是可觀。在每天錯黃的夜晚，無論你踏上任柯一條馬路，都可看到依稀的幾個鞋攤，一塊一丈見方的藍布，上面陳列著一行一行的皮鞋；皮鞋上面油光閃燦，驟然看去簡直比皮鞋店的新皮鞋還要動人。因為他們對於那些舊皮鞋有過份的修飾，所以一般路人往往也會被吸住走去賞玩－回；如果是一個住哈不久的人，見了這種「介廉物美」（？）的貨色，自不免為貪心所驅使而去購買的。</p>
<p>至於這種舊皮鞋攤上的皮鞋式樣，恐怕連一家差不多的皮鞋店也遠不及牠那麼齊全；牠這裏有婦女的新式高跟鞋，平底鞋，最流行的挖空花鞋，兒童的搭帶鞋，高底鞋，男人的尖頭鞋，團尖鞋美國式皮鞋，俄國式皮鞋，軍人用的馬靴，……各式各樣的男女皮鞋無不俱備。這種舊皮鞋的來源，說起來也頗耐人尋味。最主要的來源當然是從「收爛貨」的那裏「轉手」，其次便是和小偷市塲打成一片。收買舊皮鞋和出賣舊皮鞋，這一出一進雖都有連　關係，但其經營卻是各自獨立的。收買舊皮鞋都是由「收爛貨」的去幹，他們除收買新聞紙，玻璃瓶，破衣服，雜物等等之外。最歡迎的就是舊皮鞋了。舊皮鞋在他們收進以後，便担到「破爛市」轉售給皮鞋修補匠；在這一轉手的過程中，「收爛貨」的最多不過賺一二毛錢一雙的代價而已，享厚利的還是那般有修補技術的皮鞋匠和資本充足的皮鞋「販子」。另外還有小倫愉來的贓貨，則都直接由皮鞋「販子」收買，「收爛貨」的就不得過間；因為一般皮鞋「販子」大都有點潛勢力，小偷們多數需要靠他們的保障的。不過在這種行業中，也有所謂「托辣斯」和另一種業務上的組織。一個「托辣斯」主持者大都要具備財力與人力兩種條件。他要有大量的資本，收買別人所不敢買的貨色，還要有為收買貨色出了「岔子」而能走「門路」的力量；具備了這種力量，才能兼營收買，修補，出賣三種業務。不過舊皮鞋業中有這和能力的人究屬少數：其餘多數是做修補工作的就不兼營出賣，出賣的又都不善於修補，至多也不過是白天做修補的工匠，晚上便做舊皮鞋的主人罷了。</p>
<p>一雙舊皮鞋的通常價值，在收買時最多不過三毛錢，但經過「收爛貨」的一轉手，便要賣到五六毛左右，再經過修補匠和皮鞋「販子」的手裏一溜。牠的價錢就增加到二元幾角。這種利息雖然根高，可是在買主方面卻並不覺得昂貴；因為在哈市買一雙上等的皮較要十幾元，次一點的也得七八元，如果比起二元多錢一雙的舊皮鞋來，當然是後者便宜、何況平常一雙皮鞋釘一次前後掌的代價，也得花上一元七八角呢！所以一般經濟能力有限的小資產階級，都還樂意做那班舊鞋攤上的主顧。</p>
<p>一個皮鞋攤的資本，多少頗不一定，最大的有三五百元，小的不過百多元。這類攤上的主人。有的是從前做「收爛貨」賺了錢。改行來經耆舊皮鞋的出賣；有的是一般失了業的皮鞋工人，在沒有正式工作時，就湊集一點錢來自已做「老　」。大的皮鞋攤有時一個人財力不夠，便集合三五個人合夥經營；小的則多半是獨資經營。但是，為什慶有些人寗願合夥做大的攤主，而不肯單獨經營呢？這裹面也有一種「大魚吃小魚的併吞作用。因為資本大的鞋攤，牠可以吸收八方的貨色，如尖頭，寬頭，篇頭，微凸，平方，以及俄國式，日本式，還有本地士式，都能兼收並蓄，留待各種不伺的顧主前來選購，營業自易於發達；但小資本的鞋攤就不敢大量的吸收這類的負物，他們所有的多數是一些通常的樣式，因而所能應接的顧主也就不多。再加大鞋攤因為營業發達，利息也取得較輕；但小鞋攤就不能這樣，原因是鞋樣不多，一天難望有幾個顧主光臨，若賣得過於便宜，便沒有什麼好處了。所以一般小鞋攤總不願和大鞋攤做鄰舍，但是因為受不了資本的壓力的緣故。</p>

<h3 id="c176">希臘和奧大利的復辟運動 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 希仁</p>
<p>最近歐洲有兩個國家發生復辟運動，這兩個國家即是巴爾幹半島的重要國家之一的希臘和多事的奥大利。現在，希臘的復辟運動已經勝利，希王喬治一世業已回到雅曲，馬上就要行使王權，授命組織新聞；至於奥大利的復辟運動，則正在猛烈進行中，牠是否能和希臘的一樣，獲得勝利，還是很大的問題。不過，希臘復辟運動的成功和奥國的正在巡行中的復辟運動，都不僅是這兩個國家的問題，其對於目前歐洲的整個局勢都是有很大關係的。所以，我們特在這裏將這兩者同時提出來談談。</p>
<p>先談希臘的復辟，就表面看來，希臘之再現帝制政治，好像全是在十一月間舉行全國公民投票的結果。其實希臘的帝制派和共和派的爭鬬是有很久的歷史與很複雜的國際關係的。</p>
<p>希臘是一個半殖民地的國家，其國內的一切事變都與歐洲列強有深切的關係。我們單看希臘的復辟運動不早不遲恰於英意在地中海上尖銳對立的目前，急轉直下，獲得勝利，便不難想到此次希臘帝制派之大獲勝利的意義了。從地理上說，希臘是東界愛琴海，南接地中海，西連伊奥尼亞海，海岸綫之長甲於世界，港灣島嶼也很多，而且大半都很重要，是歐洲列强，特別是英意兩國在地中海和巴爾幹的角逐中所重視的一個國家。如果意大利獲得了希臘，利用其地勢，便有隨時佔領英國在地中海的根據地瑪爾泰島並進而將英人驅逐出地中海之外的可能；反之，英國必要得到希臘的積極援助，才能在地中海上與意大利抗爭。所以，自來英意兩國就在暗中爭奪希臘，希臘的保王黨就是在英國扶助下發展起來一的。最近由於意阿開火，英意在地中海上的爭鬬是更加尖銳更加現實了，英人爲要積極利用希臘以牽制意大利，便乘着意國正有事東菲之際，鼓動希臘保王黨趕早宣布廢棄共和，實行帝制。本來希臘的實行帝制是要由上一月的公民投票來决定，但希臘陸長保王黨領袖貢第利斯生怕機會錯過，乃提早於十月十日鼓動軍人，逼迫杳爾達利斯內閣辭職，並由國民大會宣布廢除共和，迎喬治二世復位，貢第利斯自任攝政，暫組臨時過渡內閣◆於是，十一月的公民投票便在保王黨的包辦之下舉行，結果是參加投票者計一，五二七，七一二人，其中贊成君主制者一，四九一，九九二票，贊成共和制者三二，四五四票，慶票三，二六八，帝制派獲得百分之九十的多數，當然大獲全勝。但希臘帝制派的這個勝利，同時也是英國在希臘的勝利。</p>
<p>當然，希臘復辟之實現，不僅有其外的關係，而且是有其內的原因的。事實上，希臘這個小國經過了五六年的經濟恐慌後，農村的貧困，城中的衰頽，失業者的增加，一般國民的生活日益苦痛，已使其不能維持平安的常態了。所謂政治罷工等非常現象，在過去幾個月中的希臘已成爲了司空見慣的事實。很顯然的，是本年三月希臘自由黨魁維尼瑞洛斯領導一部份陸軍和海軍，實行軍事政變，引起了震動歐洲的希臘內戰。這雖然在表面上是一種軍事政變，但實際上在事變過程中却有廣大的人民參加，而使這一事變在另一方面表現成爲希臘的民業運動。在此情形下，希臘政治的兩極端的傾向已成爲了顯然的事實，帝制派爲要打擊共和派，壓服民眾，便在英國扶助之下，乘機提早實行復辟，廢除了共和制度。</p>
<p>本來，自一九三三年希臘帝制派在選舉中獲得勝利，接近帝政的人民黨首要查爾達利斯組閣以後的帝制派的勢力即在暗中膨脹。及至本年三月維尼瑞洛斯政變被鎭壓下去之後，希臘共和派的勢力即大受打擊，保王黨領袖貢第利斯因撲滅內亂進而掌握了希臘政府的大權。以後帝制派更不斷向共和派進攻，漸漸展開了復辟運動。但就在這時候，共和黨還保有相當勢力，一般國民也很少贊成復辟，所以七月內閣改組之後，保王黨仍不敢公然主張復辟。待到最近，保王黨業已準備充分，乃乘着英意爭鬬之際，不侍公民投票，便趕先實行復辟政變，急轉直下，一舉而廢除共和，實現帝治。—這便是希臘復辟的最近經過。</p>
<p>現在，喬治二世已返抵雅典，希臘之田共和再變爲帝制已成爲了事實，這當然是沒有什麼問題的。但多變的希臘今後是否能安定，却還是問題。首先，希邋的復辟自然爲英國所贊成，就是法國爲了小協約國與真第利斯的關係，爲了在地中海上對付霖大利，也是不反對的，但意國對於希臘的復辟却不很開心。雖然喬治二世返國時曾道經羅馬與意王和莫梭里尼會談，但意國心意中仍是不願保王黨在希臘執歡的。現在，莫梭墓尼正有專於東菲，當然無眼顧及巴爾幹，顧及希臘，但誰能說家國今後不繼續在希臘活動呢？復次，希臘復辟之實現，並未解决國內經濟政治的根本問題，而共和黨等的力量也並禾完全散失，今後反帝制的運動還有在希臘繼續發生的可能。因此，希臘保王黨和其背後的英國雖然獲得了一時的勝利，但今後的希臘乃至歐洲依然是不會安寗的。</p>
<p>其次是正在進行的奥國復辟運動。本來奥國的開辟運動由來已久，但過去因爲奧夫利問題過分複雜和嚴重，未曾實現。最近正當歐洲多事之際，奧大利的復辟運動又行劇烈起來，而且奧總理體樞尼格與副總理斯特倫堡親王也參加復辟示威行動。因此，奥大利問題又成爲了目前歐洲各國所注意的重要問題之一。</p>
<p>關於奥大利問題的複雜性和重要性，在他種刊物上已經談得太多，我們不想在這裏多作解釋。現在我們所要說的僅是目前奥國的復辟運動。此種運動的背後主持者不消說是意大利。因爲奥國復辟一實現，必然要影響到匈牙利，結果會使奥匈依附於意大利之下，意國獨覇中歐，作多瑙河的盟主。據哈瓦斯電稱，因「奥國哈布斯保舊皇室中某貴胄與意國某公主結爲秦晋之好」，所以意國並不堅决反對奥大利的復辟。這當然是一種形式的看法；不過，從意奥的根本利害關係上說來，意大利確是不僅不反對奥國復辟，而且還想其早日實現的。</p>
<p>但是，法國的衛星小協約國一聽到奥國要復辟就會感到頭痛。因爲如果奥國復辟實現，匈牙利受影響，結果便要成爲奥匈合併，把小協約國從中切開，不能聯絡。同時正在圖謀德奥合併的希特勒，當然也是不願奥國復辟的。所以，自奥大利復辟運動發展的消息傳出後，小協約國，法國和德國都表示了堅决反對的意見。英國雖然還未表朋態度，低當其正在設法由解决奥國問題來轉變帝國主義的二次大戰的性質之際，可以料到牠也不會贊成奥國復辟的。在此情形下，我們可以說奧國的復辟運動絕不會有像希臘那樣的順利，其勝利在最近還缺少可能。</p>
<p>總而言之，希臘復辟的賽現和奥國復辟運動的發展，都是歐洲列强的一種矛盾表現。這在多事的歐洲原是不足爲怪的。</p>

<h3 id="c177">蘇伊士運河 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 季良</p>
<p>意阿開戰以來，曾有國聯要封鎖蘇伊士運河的傳說。一時之間，所謂蘇伊士運河這名稱差不多比較地中海還要被人重視。因爲蘇伊士運河在地勢上是横斷埃及之蘇伊士地峽，貫通紅海和地中海的交通要道，有了它，歐亞菲三洲才連成了一片，如果眞的實行封銷蘇伊士運河，那意大利的軍隊便很難運到東菲，因而不僅意阿戰爭的形勢要爲之改變，恐怕意國在東菲的殖民地也要發生問題呢。所以萬一英國實行封鎖蘇伊士運河，意大利卽有很大可能以武力抵抗，結果是會使第二次世界大戰更快的爆發。這就是人們在這時特別注意蘇伊士運河的原因。</p>
<p>說到蘇伊士運河的歷史，我們便不難想到十九仳紀歐洲列强的分割菲洲。就在一八五〇年間，除菲洲的文明古國埃及之外，菲洲的其他地方還爲世人所不知道。後來由於歐洲列强要求殖民地的迫切，才有許多探險家深入菲洲內地探險，隨後才有商人政客來到這「黑暗神秘的大陸」，於是人們才知道菲洲還有巨大的內海，雄壯的大川瀑布，奇異的果木花草和昆虫，偉大美麗的森林山岳，怪異可怕的野獸，豐富的物產。爲了殖民菲洲的便利，爲了侵略亞細亞的便利，英法等國才實行開鑿蘇伊士運河。動工時，由法人雷賽主持，從一八五九年到一八六一年整整經過了十載的時間才得完工，費欵二億元，總計河長八十七哩。因爲有了這條運河，歐洲人不僅容易殖民菲洲，而且更易侵略亞洲了。如英之於印度，緬甸，馬來諸島，法之於印度支那，荷之於馬來羣島，意之於東菲，以及英决西葡和比利時等之於菲洲，都要全靠蘇伊士運河這個交通線來實行其侵略。所以，歐洲列强對於蘇</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>伊士運河都很注意，並曾訂立嚴格的條約來保障這運河的安全。</p>
<p>蘇伊士運河是由蘇伊士萬國運河公司經營，這個公司曾從埃及政府獲得了九十九年的使用權。公司共有股票八十萬，其中就有三十五萬三千多在英政府手中。英國之所以握有這樣多的股票，是因爲在一八七五年時牠由埃及買去了十七萬六千六百股票。除英國的之外，其餘的股票則是散布在法國的民間。但是，運河公司並沒有絕對的政治權限。因爲運河到底是埃及領土之一部，而且，運河公司曾經確認在不妨害自由通航上埃及政府對於運河有保護及警察權。</p>
<p>一八八八年十月二十日英法俄德奧匈士意西班牙荷蘭和埃及等國代表曾在君士坦丁舉行會議，締結了規定蘇伊士運河中立的條約。其條文大要如下：</p>
<p>一·蘇伊士運河無論在戰時或平時，無論其船艦是屬於什麼國家，都得自由航行。</p>
<p>一·在離運河及河口三英里以內之地禁止戰爭行爲。</p>
<p>一·交戰國軍艦通過運河時，如沒有遇倒如天災等不可抗禦的事情，不准在蘇伊士港停留二十四小時以上。</p>
<p>一·交戰國的軍艦通過後，如還沒有經過二十四小時，對方軍艦不能出發。</p>
<p>一·土耳其皇帝及埃及王有蘇伊士運河警察權。</p>
<p>因此，在蘇伊士運河上列强都不便隨意行動。如當日俄戰爭時，日本雖是當時英國的同盟國，但英人還是不得不默認俄國軍艦通過蘇伊士運河攻擊日本。又如一九一一年意士戰爭時，埃及雖然是士耳其的領土，却不能阻止意國海軍在運河中自由來往。由此當可見到列强對於蘇伊士運河的態度了。</p>
<p>不過，待到眞的所謂非常時期到來時，列强便不會遵守條文了。事實上，蘇伊士運河雖有上述條文的規定，而且已曾有過遵守條文的事實，但在過去仍然有三次封鎖的事情發生。第一，是在埃及人反對埃及總督的革命事件發生時，英軍曾掌握運河三天，禁止船舶通過。第二，是一八九八年西班牙與英國交戰時，運河當局曾禁止西班牙艦隊在航行運河中上煤。第三，就是在歐洲大戰中，由土耳其軍艦的進出，運河曾被封鎭一時。自然，除了在這短時期外，在長期的大戰中，運河仍保有自由航行的常態。</p>
<p>一九一九年，巴黎和會雖决定埃及為英國的保謎國，但英國在巴黎和會中却獲得了保護蘇伊士運河的權利，當其在一大二二年承認埃及獨立時，仍聲明保留此種權利。對於英國的這個聲明，埃及始終沒有承認的表示，只不過是英國單方面的一種聲明而已。但因此埃及的一切仍得受英支配·一九二九年英埃締約，英國雖在表面上對埃及獨立有更進一步之表示，但仍藉口保護蘇伊士運河，常駐相當軍隊於埃境，並仍在實際上干涉埃及內政。</p>
<p>因爲英國能左右埃及，獲得了蘇伊士運河的保護權，佔有多數的股票，所以現在運河的實權大部分操於英人之手。目前意大利遠征東菲，威脅英國利益，而英人還未毅然實行封鎖蘇伊士運河以苦意大利者，乃是因其顧忌國際局勢未敢隨意行動的關係。</p>
<p>現在，埃及的獨立運動正在發展，東菲的殺氣還在繼續高揚，其結果對於蘇伊士運河的形勢都有很大影響。我們瞧着吧。</p>

<p>— 濮漁</p>
<p>『自然。前兒有我的關係，但是你不貪便宜，决不能成事實，你二百多担酒（合磅稱二萬多斤），纔納四百元的稅。—老實地說：我是體念商情，不忍心你們多出錢。其實我自己有烏的好處？……』</p>
<p>『總不是我的過錯，就……就弄到省局，也不是我……我個人吃虧！』</p>
<p>媽的，人不可貌相，他還有膽兒上訴呢！我正預備掃他一回馬槍，可喜老江代我出陣了：</p>
<p>『李老闆，你沒有理由辯別的。你說曾納過稅，有證據沒有？主任收你的錢有憑據嗎？在公事上單靠口頭說話，你還要受到誣鑖公務人員的懲罰呢！—這倒不說，我們主任原是好心眼，誰知你要亂得罪人，給別個密吿。這次省局的公事，單指你們偸漏，我們祗有辦理的責任。』</p>
<p>老頭子臉色愈益發靑，喉管漲得很大，兩手不住揑放，我明白他心里忿怒，怨恨，凄凉，着急；同時也在準備掙扎的方法。最後忽然興奮起來，毅然的說；</p>
<p>「好！祇怪我不該開槽坊，横順都是送錢，陪你們打官司！」</p>
<p>我這時氣惱，着急，覺得老頭子變成了頑强的野獸；不聽我指揮，不受我束縛。然而也許是廻光反照，終要給他一個致命的打擊。</p>
<p>「媽的，打官司？老百姓同公務人員作對，不是自找苦吃！」我心里這麽罵。的確，假如老頭子眞不自量要同我作對，那就不怪我壞良心；馬上一封公文報到省局，硬說他偸漏，隨便找幾個人做證明，他到那兒去分辯？不過話得說回來，我也不高興打麻煩，祇要老頭子能够就我的範圍也得。於是故意的把臉子裝和平，聲音變柔軟：</p>
<p>『李老闆，我柳某是够朋友的啦！前兒少收你的稅欵，是體恤你，今兒爲了公事——然而並未打官腔，全講的私人交情，但你偏偏要板面孔，陪我打官司，……』我遲緩兩分鐘，探看他的臉色，『你已經决定了嗎？』我看他仍是氣冲冲的表示不甘屈服，覺得非剷平他那硬勁不可：『好！這就對不住！』</p>
<p>於是命令江錫五打開皮包，取出最高法寳：硃單，封條。老頭子一對過度驚嚇的眼睛死盯住江錫五的動作。我接過硃單很嚴厲的唸給他聽：（未完）</p>

<p>終於在銀幕上實現了</p>
<p>當「仲夏夜之夢」A　Midsummer　Nigit　Dream開映的時候，如果鬼魂有靈，莎翁瞧見了銀幕上所映出的景物，一定會感到非常的驚奇吧！在一個生長在舞臺背景和攝影技術都沒有發明的時代的人物，祇要看見演員們，在一座裝有華麗的深林背景和燦爛的皇宮背景的舞臺活躍着，已經好像是看魔術了。現在，這種新奇的電影技術，不是更要使他驚奇嗎？</p>
<p>這一個幻想的故事，在全世界的舞臺上，已經演過不知道多少次數了。在最早的時候。是在一種樸紫無辜的戱臺上，沒有背景，劇中的景物，是要看客自己去想像的。後來舞臺背景發明了，然而即使最大的舞臺和最佳的設計，和現在雷恩哈德的銀幕上的「仲夏夜之夢」，終於是小巫見大巫了。</p>
<p>你瞧在這片子裏，那樹林好像是無終點的，不像在舞臺上有一幅後幕來限制它，寡面還有一百個仙女，在月光下舞蹈；人頭和驢頭掉換；奥白朗帶着他的許多大蝙蝠釗森林裏來，看上去好像是眞正的蝙蝠，一切的一切，都祇有電影技術可以做到得的。</p>
<p>總之，華納公司，經過了兩年餘的時間，耗去一百五十萬金元，絞盡數千人的心血，居然把莎翁的一個幻夢，在銀幕上實現了，片子不久將在國泰獻映，你如果想領略片中夢景，請等着瞧罷。</p>
<h3 id="c181">「船家女」中的徐來 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>蘇子瞻說：「惜乎賈生王者之佐，而不能自用其才也。」</p>
<p>我每每想起這兩名話，便有很深的感觸。無論什麽人，我都不相信他是絕對沒有才能的，就假定是一個最平凡的人，他也一定有他的用處。問題是怎樣的去發見他的才能，怎樣的去發揮他的才能·只要能够適才適所，便不難獲得驚人的成績。</p>
<p>常常有人說：「徐來是不善於做戱的。」但是對於「船家女」中的徐來，誰還能夠下這樣的冷評呢？當她做模特兒的時候，她本來想哭，而少爺們偏要她笑；她那時的表情和動作，直到現在，還仿佛在我的眼前。就是妓院樓上的一幕，和最後父女團圓的一幕，都是値得觀眾的讚賞的。</p>
<p>徐來在「船家女」中，怎樣會突然得到這樣的成功呢？我相信這不能不歸功於導演者路西苓君。一個演員能否成功，固然和他自身的才能有關，要是沒有導演去發見的才能，央發揮他的才能，縱有過人的本事，恐怕也有被湮沒的危險罷。</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Understanding That Chinese People Should Have Regarding the North China Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>—Advocacy</p>
<p>Since the Tongzhou Incident occurred, Sino-Japanese relations have become increasingly strained. The Japanese army has increased its troops in eastern Hebei and once occupied important stations between Beiping and Tianjin. They have used every possible means of coercion. The National Government has also failed to effectively address the puppet autonomous movement of the Yin Rugeng clique. At this moment, when the provinces of North China are once again in a state of unrest, all Chinese people with a sense of national consciousness should deeply feel their responsibility to save the nation. However, when we talk about saving the nation today, we must first have a clear understanding of the current North China situation. Let us discuss this from three aspects.</p>
<p>First, under the current circumstances, Japan does have intentions to deeply penetrate North China. However, its government, considering the attitudes of Britain and the United States and the national sentiment of our people, still has to take some concerns into account. Seizing North China by force is definitely not what they want. After all, what benefit would it be to Japan if North China became a scorched earth? However, Japanese militarists may still want to emulate the Shenyang Incident and create a new situation in North China through independent actions, waiting for their government to endorse it. The puppet autonomous organizations in eastern Hebei are one example. But we must know that although the arrogance of the Japanese militarists is strong, if our entire nation unites and responds with a firm will and prudent attitude, then their temporary arrogance can be slightly contained.</p>
<p>Second, North China generals such as Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, and Han Fuju, judging from their past attitudes, are all capable of deeply understanding righteousness and being loyal to the central government. Recently, they have resisted threats and inducements and have not plunged into the vortex of puppet autonomy, which further demonstrates their upright integrity. The people of the country should give the generals of North China great trust and encouragement, so that they can fulfill their responsibilities of defending their territory.</p>
<p>Third, our government's diplomatic policy towards Japan has been clearly expressed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his speech at the Fifth Plenary Session of the National Congress. To summarize, it is "to seek political coordination with friendly nations within the limit of not infringing upon sovereignty" and "to be determined for the final sacrifice and to make the greatest efforts for peace." Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged serious protests with the Japanese Ambassador to China regarding the so-called "North China Autonomous Movement" instigated by Japanese militarists in China and the Japanese army's unauthorized occupation of Fengtai Railway Station. It has also notified all countries that Yin Rugeng's treasonous acts are invalid. The newly appointed Director of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Office, He Yingqin, also set off north yesterday to deal with everything. All of this proves that our government is strictly adhering to the maximum limit of tolerance and making the greatest efforts for peace. The timeliness of this diplomatic action is something that the people of the country should recognize.</p>
<p>Although the situation in North China today is extremely serious, it has not yet reached the point of hopelessness for peace. The people of the country should use calm and meticulous minds to carefully consider the future of the nation and use the united will of the whole country to provide a strong backing for the government's diplomacy. If there is no mutual trust and understanding within the country, and people are still acting impulsively and recklessly to seek temporary gratification, then the future of our nation will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Chinese Antiquities in London</p>
<h3 id="e15">First Day Sees Over Three Thousand Visitors; Various European Languages Can Be Heard; Experts and Journalists Specially Sent by Various Countries to Write Reports; Parisian Clothing Stores Adopt Chinese-Style Colors; The British Emperor and Empress, Along with the Royal Family, Also Visit <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British Emperor will visit the Chinese art exhibition with the Empress, the Duke and Duchess of Kent, and other members of the royal family on Sunday. Judging from the current situation, the exhibition will be an unprecedented success. Yesterday was the first day open to the public, and there were over three thousand visitors, more than a thousand more than on the opening day of the British art exhibition. The art exhibitions held in London in the past have never had as many visitors as yesterday. There are still many visitors today. Admission is five shillings per person. According to a doorman, "I have never seen so many visitors to an art exhibition. It is truly rare." At the entrance of the exhibition hall, there are two beautiful Chinese girls dressed in red Chinese silk clothing, helping to sell photos of the exhibits. The number of foreigners visiting the exhibition is particularly astonishing. Various European languages can be heard in the exhibition hall. About forty people are recognized as experts in Chinese art, specially sent by major European newspapers to report on the exhibition. Germany alone has four people. They have already arrived one after another. A famous clothing store in Paris has adopted Chinese-style colors and styles, creating many new clothes. Literary, cultural, and commercial groups from all over Europe send letters to Burlington House every day inquiring about convenient travel arrangements to visit the exhibition in England. The British textile industry is now paying close attention to the exhibition. The Bradford Chamber of Commerce has specially sent several experts to visit and study everything. After receiving their reports, the chairman and all directors plan to come and feast their eyes on the exhibition in person. Dr. David is scheduled to begin giving sixteen lectures on Chinese art today, presided over by Prince Adolph of Sweden, an art expert. This is organized by the Royal Society, whose building is adjacent to Burlington House. The number of tickets purchased exceeds the capacity of the venue by three times. Six lectures have already been sold out. Many visitors spend half a day focusing on one exhibit, indicating that they will come back to see the other exhibits in the future. Today, the room of ancient bronze artifacts from the Shang and Zhou dynasties is attracting the most attention. Visitors are amazed by its beauty. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) The famous Swedish explorer Dr. Sven Hedin has conducted surveys in Central Asia, West Asia, and Chinese Xinjiang and Mongolia for many years. He recently gave a lecture here entitled "Eight Years of Struggle in Central Asia and West Asia." He claimed to have discovered about ten thousand pieces of Chinese wood carvings, with ancient writing on them. He is currently working on translating them, which will take about ten years to complete. It is hoped that a true picture of ancient Chinese life two thousand years ago can be obtained through this.

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, protested to Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota as follows: "According to the Treaty of Aigun of 1858, only ships of the Qing Dynasty and Russia are allowed to navigate the Heilongjiang River, the Songhua River, and the Ussuri River. Furthermore, according to the agreement signed in 1934 between the Heilongjiang State-Run Shipping Company and the Harbin Water Transport Bureau of Manchukuo, only ships of Manchukuo and the Soviet Union are allowed to pass through the aforementioned rivers. However, on October 29th, a ship flying the Japanese flag left the mouth of the Songhua River and sailed down the Heilongjiang River. Ships flying the Japanese flag have previously attempted to enter the Heilongjiang River and the Songhua River." Yurenev pointed out that the illegal entry of Japanese ships into the Heilongjiang River and the Ussuri River violates the treaty. Therefore, he asked Hirota to investigate this matter thoroughly and take measures to ensure that similar actions do not occur in the future. Hirota replied that he had not heard of the matters listed by Yurenev and promised to investigate the situation. (TASS, 30th)</p>

A total of 21 million yen of revival requests have been approved. The financial resources include 14 million yen of public bonds. Therefore, based on the current total estimated revenue and expenditure of 2,265 million yen, the amount of public bonds to be issued is 680 million yen, a decrease of 68 million yen compared to the amount issued in 1935. Among them, the military budget is 500 million yen for the Army and 550 million yen for the Navy, totaling 1,050 million yen, accounting for 46.3% of the total expenditure.

<p>Ministry of Education: 43 7</p>
<p>Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry: 74 29</p>
<p>The Army held a leadership meeting regarding the Ministry of Finance's budget proposal and made another revival request. As a result, the Ministry of Finance has reached a compromise with the Army in yesterday's cabinet meeting, approving the Army's revival request of 8 million yen and the Navy's revival request of 2 million yen. The difficult hurdle of Japan's budget issue has been overcome. (Hualian, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e19">Japanese Budget Compromise; Military Dissatisfied with Minister of the Army; Financial Circles Consider it Gratifying <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The budget cabinet felt great difficulty in breaking through the difficult hurdle of the military budget. A compromise was reached only this morning. The final budget cabinet meeting was held from 7:10 AM, where Finance Minister Takahashi presented his views, stating that compared to the original assessment of the Ministry of Finance, the first approval of 10 million yen each for the Army and Navy, and the second approval of 8 million yen for the Army and 2 million yen for the Navy for revival requests, but that the financial resources were not sought from public bonds, which was in line with his intentions. Minister of the Army Kawashima then expressed his gratitude for the lengthy budget process. The extremely dangerous cabinet meeting at one time dissipated, and all cabinet members were delighted. The meeting adjourned at 7:20 AM. (Dentsu, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the government budget was decided, Prime Minister Okada issued a statement saying, "It is gratifying that the budget for 1936 was successfully decided with the enthusiasm and cooperation of all cabinet members. The current domestic and international situation is serious, and national defense must be emphasized, while industry and other aspects must also be emphasized. Compiling the budget was very difficult, but it was resolved with the spirit of mutual cooperation among the ministries." Minister of the Army Kawashima also said that the total budget for the Army is 508 million yen. The focus of the discussion last night was on the equipment preparation costs. As a result, it was decided that 400 million yen would be allocated for six years, and 55 million yen would be allocated for the first year (i.e., 1936). The equipment preparation plan mainly focuses on preparing aircraft, which is absolutely necessary for the current war plan. From the perspective of the General Staff Headquarters, this amount is not satisfactory. However, considering the current financial situation, this amount had to be decided. (Nichiren, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Navy Osumi said, "The budget has been decided, which is very gratifying. However, the Navy's budget is over 550 million yen, which is the minimum from the perspective of military reduction. The Navy will also not neglect domestic issues that must be urgently addressed, such as cultivating national strength, revitalizing rural areas, and recovering from disasters. The belief that solid military strength must be built on a solid foundation of national power will not waver. When exercising this budget, we should strive for the best economy and efficiency to achieve economic military preparedness and prevent the outflow of excessive national funds overseas, in order to contribute to the development of local people's strength." (Dentsu, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although the Army's financial authorities have reached a compromise and the compromise of 8 million yen has been allocated, there is suspicion of disregarding the operational stance of the General Staff Headquarters. Within the Army, the theory of responsibility of Minister of the Army Kawashima has gradually emerged. (Dentsu, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The leaders of the General Staff Headquarters oppose Minister of the Army Kawashima's compromise on the Army budget in both substance and spirit. However, since the Minister of the Army has already expressed his approval in the cabinet meeting, superficially opposing it would expose the issue of the Army's dignity. Therefore, they reluctantly accepted the compromise. Moreover, for this reason, the breakdown of the cabinet meeting was avoided. The General Staff Headquarters' approval is superficial, and inwardly, there is concern that the compromise will make it difficult to maintain the military strength that is the fundamental element for breaking through the extraordinary situation. Furthermore, the fact that the post and telecommunications employees' treatment expenses were obtained has left a deep impression on the people, which has led to dissatisfaction. The same opinion is held within the Ministry of the Army. Therefore, Minister of the Army Kawashima's position has become delicate, and its progress is noteworthy. In particular, the problematic issue is that 3 million yen of the revived 8 million yen is incorporated into a special account, and most of this account is closely related to the mass life of proletarian employees within the scope of the special account. Therefore, using it to strengthen the core of breaking through the extraordinary situation is inconsistent with the spirit of the Imperial Army and goes against the Army's long-promoted broad national defense policy. Therefore, the strong argument is that even if shortcomings are tolerable, from the perspective of the spirit of the Imperial Army and the spirit of Japan, the 3 million yen should be returned to the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, its future is noteworthy. (Dentsu, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Governor Fukai of the Bank of Japan made the following remarks regarding the successful formulation of the budget proposal: "From the perspective of the Bank of Japan, I would like to avoid criticizing the content of the budget. However, it is gratifying that the iron rule of gradually reducing public bonds has been implemented, which is beneficial in terms of digesting public bonds and maintaining credit. Each aspect may view it with goodwill. Japan's deficit public bonds have now reached a considerable amount, but without adverse effects, which is considered incredible by all countries. Therefore, the current budget formulation will have a better impact on foreign credit." (Dentsu, 30th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice believes that the cases of killing relatives reported by various courts are often excessively lenient, which is a misunderstanding of the legislative intent of Article 272 of the new criminal law. On the 30th, it issued a special circular to all courts, stating that in the future, when handling major cases of killing relatives, the personnel involved must carefully investigate and prudently handle the matter, and must not misunderstand the legislative intent and give a general lighter sentence with sweeping language. If the most severe sentence is improperly applied to such cases, or if it is known to be improper and no appeal is filed, disciplinary action will be taken upon discovery to maintain social morality and promote fundamental solutions.

<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan previously had a proposal to enact a women's labor law, which Sun Ke then forwarded to the Labor Committee for review.

In the future, when formulating an employee labor insurance law, if there is a need to specially protect female workers, it can be added at any time. According to the actual needs of our country and referring to the legislative precedents of various countries, it seems unnecessary to enact a special law. The committee has now submitted its report to Sun Ke for review. (Central News Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The headquarters of the pseudo-Chinese Autonomous Alliance Army was discovered in Wu'an County, on the border of Hebei and Henan. Bao Zhenguo secretly organized a headquarters in the county seat, widely recruiting bandits from Wu'an, Daming, Cixian, and Chengan to engage in rebellious activities. They also planned to attack Pengcheng in Henan as their base. They appointed Zhang Juzhong as a pseudo-division commander, who recruited over a thousand members of the Longmao secret society in the border area of Wu'an and Shasha, and set a date for an uprising. A pseudo-adjutant, Liu Yuqing, was sent to Daming to incite miners under the guise of recruiting soldiers. The county magistrate arrested several leaders and seized pseudo-seals and appointment certificates. The Fourth Cavalry Division of Daming has been dispatched to search the surrounding villages. The pseudo-army is supported by Shi Yousan and includes Japanese rōnin. (Special Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Japanese Cabinet Negotiates All Night to Compile a Budget Compromise; Approval of 10 Million Yen Additional Funding for the Army; Total Amount is 2.27 Billion Yen; Shortage of Over 1 Million Yen, But No Public Bonds Issued <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Government Budget Cabinet continued to meet on the morning and afternoon of the 29th. As a result of the discussion on the military budget, a compromise was reached at 8:30 PM to approve the Army's revival request of 8 million yen and an additional 2 million yen for the Navy. The Accounting Bureau then organized the accounting at 11:00 PM. The Army reported this result to the General Staff Headquarters and requested their understanding. However, the General Staff Headquarters maintained a strong stance and insisted on an additional 10 million yen for the Army. Vice Chief of Staff Sugiyama met with the Chief of the Finance Ministry's Secretariat, Shirane, and others at 2:00 AM, strongly stating that the Army needed 10 million yen from a national defense perspective and requested the Finance Ministry to reconsider this matter twice. However, at 3:00 AM, Vice Minister Koshō, under the command of Minister of the Army Kawashima, went to the General Staff Headquarters to meet with Vice Chief of Staff Sugiyama. As a result of two hours of coordination, the General Staff Headquarters also approved 8 million yen. Vice Minister Koshō then reported to the Minister of the Army at 5:30 AM this morning, and the Minister of the Army relayed it to the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Meeting continued at 7:00 AM to formally decide the budget. The Manchurian Incident expenses, the first reserve fund, and the second reserve fund were reduced by 5 million yen. Therefore, there is still a financial resource shortfall of 1.1 million yen. The Ministry of Finance is trying to find the financial resources, but will not issue public bonds. (Nichiren, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Cabinet Meeting, Finance Minister Takashi issued a statement saying, "It is truly a cause for national celebration that the budget has been successfully resolved with the cooperation of Prime Minister Okada and all Cabinet members. I sincerely thank the relevant authorities for their day and night efforts. The establishment of the so-called cooperative budget is very beneficial for the future. The total budget amount decided by the final Cabinet Meeting is 2.17 billion yen, and the total amount of public bonds is 680 million yen." (Dentsu, 30th)</p>

<p>Alexandria According to a Reuters correspondent in the Suez Canal area, no one is paying attention to the talk of an Italian invasion of Egypt, no matter how many troops Mussolini sends to Libya. The reasons are as follows: (1) A 300-mile desert without water sources would leave attacking troops nowhere to escape British air attacks. (2) Lack of roads. (3) Armed Arabs riding back and forth are sufficient to endanger the Italian army's flanks. (4) British machine gun teams are densely deployed along the border, with barbed wire set up in front of their defenses for protection. (5) British and Egyptian soldiers have built trenches that are very thorough, and the British fleet off the Libyan coast can easily bombard Italian troops attacking from the north. Even if enemy troops attacking from the south can avoid British air attacks when crossing the desert, they will be bombarded by British machine guns and heavy artillery upon landing in Marsa Matruh. Beyond that, there are other natural barriers, and Alexandria is surrounded by gun emplacements, enough to contain the Italian army. Even if the Italian army attacks Egypt from the air, the British air force is strong enough to repel them. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Today's gazette contains the first report from General Badoglio, the new commander-in-chief of Italian East Africa, after taking office. It states that the Italian army is still engaged in clearing operations in the Uolchefit area. An Italian column encountered armed Arabs on the west bank of the Qieba River. After a brief battle, the enemy retreated, abandoning ten bodies. Today, an Italian air squadron from the new Gura Hai airfield departed and continued to bomb Dagabur, destroying several transport vehicles. According to news from Asmara, Italian reconnaissance aircraft discovered a large Afghan army advancing north between Amba Aradam and Ashangi. It is also reported that the land occupied by the extreme left-wing Danakil column has not been completely cleared of Afghan soldiers. Italian aircraft in the area are often heavily bombarded by Afghan soldiers with machine guns. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

The queen and two sons accompanied him to the suburbs. After the king embraced them, he went to Taixi. Soon, a large convoy of freight cars carrying the king's luggage and camping equipment departed from the capital. Six hundred guardsmen marched to Taixi three days ago to clear the road for the royal vehicle. After the king reviews the troops in Taixi, he will probably fly to the front lines. Crown Prince Hosain will remain in the capital to govern. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) According to reliable sources, the chairman of the Committee of Eighteen, Portuguese representative Vasconcellos, after discussing with French Prime Minister Laval and British Minister without Portfolio Eden by telephone, has decided that the Committee of Eighteen should meet at 11:00 AM on December 12th. At that time, in addition to discussing the oil embargo, they will also discuss ways to ban cotton and copper from being shipped to Italy. The expert committees on the implementation of sanctions continued to meet today to review the implementation of various sanctions plans by various countries and will meet again tomorrow to discuss them.

<p>(London) Most diplomats here believe that the question of war and peace in Europe can be decided within a few days. Well-informed observers believe that Anglo-Italian relations are becoming more serious today, but most people still believe that Mussolini may not be able to resist the ban on oil, coal, iron, and steel from all over the world for a long time, or he may rein in his horse on the edge of the precipice and not take risks, causing Italy and all League of Nations member states to suffer from war. It was learned today that Mussolini's threats may not change Britain's attitude. The French Prime Minister is also determined to support Britain's position this time. (National Society Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) An oil embargo against Italy is inevitable. This move will greatly hinder Italy's war to develop colonies in East Africa. At the same time, according to a Reuters dispatch from Rome, the former Italian ambassador to France once notified French Prime Minister Laval that Italy would regard this move as a hostile act, but this has been denied by the Italian authorities. The attitude of Italian newspapers towards France is now very cautious and does not make remarks that would hurt French feelings. Currently, Italy has a total of 1,080,000 soldiers under arms. Rumors that troops stationed at the Brenner Pass have been transferred to the French border have been refuted by Rome as nonsense. According to a Reuters dispatch from Geneva, all parties related to the League of Nations regret that the Committee of Eighteen cannot meet before December 12. Now that it is heard that the issue of banning oil shipments to Italy is no longer a question of whether to implement it, but only waiting for a date to be selected, everyone is greatly relieved. People in Geneva now believe that if today's Italian cabinet meeting considers the issue of Italy withdrawing from the League of Nations, it is an expected matter and nothing to be surprised about. As a result of talks between the British Ambassador to Paris and French Prime Minister Laval, it is also felt that the French Prime Minister should declare to the Italian government that if Italy attacks British troops in the Mediterranean or elsewhere, France will come to Britain's aid. This assistance is based on the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. This news has now been verified in London. Laval has notified Italy that France will follow Britain's position on the issue of banning oil shipments to Italy. Mr. Moffett, Vice President of Standard Oil of California, told guests in New York that if the US government asks oil companies to cut off Italy's oil supply, US oil companies are willing to stop selling oil to Italy. He also said that even if the list of prohibited items issued by President Roosevelt when declaring US neutrality does not include oil, the companies are willing to comply.

A communique was issued before the meeting, stating that the cabinet approved the government leader's proposal to expand the Supreme Defense Committee. The communique did not directly mention the war or the issue of sanctions. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

The representatives all promised to convey this opinion of the Italian government to their respective governments. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to political sources, if an oil embargo against Italy is implemented, it will not be as serious as most people think, because Italy has already stored a large batch of oil, and consumption has been greatly reduced after the nationwide promotion of economical use of oil. Alternatives to oil are currently being researched and may be produced in large quantities by the beginning of next year. Therefore, even if various countries impose an embargo, there will be no panic. As for why Italy is doing its best to publicize and strongly oppose the oil embargo, it is actually because this move puts Italy in an embarrassing position psychologically.

<h3 id="e49">Roosevelt Addresses the Nation: Achievements in Economic Recovery; 3 Million People Have Found Work Since Taking Office; Increased Revenue and Reduced National Debt Without Imposing New Taxes; Continued Efforts to Improve the Lives of the American People <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Atlanta President Roosevelt addressed the nation today, stating that the American economic recovery plan has been completed, and that the highest peak of spending has now been passed.</p>
<p>The President's speech was broadcast nationwide by radio and is generally regarded as Roosevelt's first move in the presidential election next year. The President's speech declared that 3 million people have found work since he took office. We no longer need to impose new taxes to increase revenue, and the budget deficit is expected to decrease. The government's credit is now better than any other country, but a few individuals and groups are trying to monopolize the nation's finances, disregard the poverty of the people, and damage the government's credit. In the spring of 1933, the national accounts proved that the entire property of the United States was not as great as the debts owed by the entire people of the United States. Today, the total debt has decreased compared to before, and the value of property has also increased sharply. We were on the verge of bankruptcy before, but now our credit is outstanding. However, recovery is by no means as simple as these figures can encompass. We look forward to the future and firmly believe that mankind's enjoyment will be better than in the past. The lives of Americans have clearly improved in the past two and a half years, but if we are concerned, we should redouble our efforts. Progress is better than recovery because it not only represents sound business, but also represents the sound progress of the lives of the American people.</p>
<p>The President then responded to those who criticized his fiscal policy, saying that you cannot borrow to pay off debt, but you can invest to expect a return. In the spring of 1933, the nation's bankers gathered in Washington to apply for assistance to avoid bankruptcy. At that time, I stated that in the next few years, the government would increase its debt burden to rescue banks, insurance companies, and railways, and to provide food and clothing for millions of people on the verge of starvation. At that time, everyone said that this was a very good plan. In order to seek their further judgment, I asked them what would be the maximum national debt that would not harm the nation's credit. They replied that the nation could bear a debt of 55,000,000,000 yuan to 70,000,000,000 yuan. I told them that there was no need for such a huge amount of money; a slight increase in debt would be enough, which is today's goal. But recalling that at that time, most bankers and big businessmen advocated a national debt that was far greater than what I had agreed to. Since the bankers of 1933 claimed that the government could bear a debt of 55,000,000,000 yuan to 70,000,000,000 yuan, then at a time when property prices are soaring, I really don't know what they would consider to be the debt that the government can bear. The previous government's debt increased by only 17,000,000,000 yuan to 21,000,000,000 yuan. This is a fact. When I took office, there was only 158,000,000 yuan in the treasury, which was not enough for a month's use. Since March 4, 1933, the national debt has increased from 21,000,000,000 yuan to 29,500,000,000 yuan, but about 1,500,000,000 yuan of which is working capital, and there are also 4,500,000,000 yuan of assets that can be converted into cash, both of which can be used to repay government bonds. The President then recounted the situation from 1924 to 1929, saying that at that time, speculation was rampant, banks collapsed, sacrificing the interests of depositors, farmers could not predict grain prices, slums were neglected, education was not paid attention to, interest rates were unusually high, child labor continued to exist, and wages were low. The situation was dangerous and unspeakable. After I took office, the government reopened banks, guaranteeing their deposits, correcting the extremely low wages of child labor, managing stock exchanges and public utilities, and designing to relieve floods and other natural disasters. The government is now formulating social security plans to seek the welfare of the masses. Regarding the future, the President said that although economic recovery has current achievements, the general public is still poor and can only afford to eat third-class food. If the general public can enjoy second-class or first-class food, arable land will naturally expand and agricultural product prices will also rise accordingly.</p>
<p>Regarding the relief plan, the President said that the gentlemen in the club are talking about their hardships because the government has allocated huge sums of money to carry out industrial revitalization. Unfortunately, they have little contact with the real America, so they cannot understand that those we treat are self-respecting Americans who believe that providing relief harms their independent nature. Although the President's speech may not immediately affect the market, the banking community has a good impression of it, because the government has hinted that it will reduce relief spending and find ways to make up for the budget deficit. However, the general public believes that this speech is a political declaration, not one directed at commerce. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Federal Emergency Relief Administration was established with the approval of Congress on May 12, 1934, for a period of two years, stipulating that the central government and the states should cooperate to relieve the suffering of unemployment. Today, Mr. Hopkins, the director of the agency, stated that the agency has now been completely terminated, and that direct relief to the unemployed has now come to an end. Speakers consider this to be a victory for the government, with a total of 300 million yuan spent on relief since May 1933. There are still 4 million unemployed people who cannot be placed, and the government has stated that local authorities should be responsible for providing relief. Whether or not funds will be reallocated to cover this expense in the future, officials are currently unwilling to express an opinion. It is heard that some states have already received sufficient funds to continue providing relief for the time being. Today, President Roosevelt gave a speech to the citizens' congress in Atlanta, Georgia, stating that the government has employed 3,155,000 unemployed people in industrial revitalization projects, and that another 375,000 people have been instructed to report to the authorities to find work. Since the implementation of the method of replacing relief with work, there has been great progress in spirit, because engaging in relief destroys the spirit of independence. President Roosevelt is very optimistic about the weather next year, saying that the American economy continues to improve and has entered a prosperous path. Although there are no new speeches, the nation's income continues to increase, and the budget deficit can be gradually reduced. The credit of the US government is now higher than that of any country. In the past, our debts were greater than our assets, but today assets and debts can offset each other. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Rural Population and Rural Land of Jiangning Moling (Continued) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Qiming, Jiang Jie</p>
<p>(V) Imbalance of Population and Land</p>
<p>In the past twenty-three years, the number of farm households has increased by one-half, while the cultivated land area has only increased by one-eighth. Therefore, the means of subsistence will inevitably increase slowly, while the number of consumers is increasing daily. In this process, the trend of farmers' lives is already more than half conceivable.</p>
<p>Now, let's analyze the figures to clarify the degree of its seriousness.</p>
<p>(I) Average Population per Household</p>
<p>The figures in the attached table are all statistics for this year, copied from the household registers kept by the heads of each town and village. Due to the Jiangning County Government's vigorous implementation of population census and registration, this material should be the most accurate. According to one town and four villages, the average population per household is 4.68 people, with very slight differences among the towns and villages.</p>
<p>Attached Table (I)</p>
<p>Average Rural Household Population in One Town and Four Villages of Jiangning, Jiangsu (1935 Survey)</p>
<p>Town/Village Name: Moling Town, Xiaoling Village, Renling Village, Xinling Village, Ailing Village, Total</p>
<p>Number of Villages Surveyed: 11, 14, 21, 36, 17, 89</p>
<p>Total Number of Households: 430, 581, 743, 1410, 826, 3990</p>
<p>Total Number of People: 2058, 2778, 3346, 6663, 3828, 18673</p>
<p>Average Population per Household: 4.79, 4.78, 4.50, 4.73, 4.63, 4.68</p>
<p>(II) Average Farm Size</p>
<p>Above, we used the total number of households in each town and village in 1934 to divide the total cultivated land area in 1934. We know that the average farm household in Moling Town has 12.4 mu of land, Xiaoling Village has 15.2 mu, Renling Village has 12.7 mu, Xinling Village has 8.0 mu, Ailing Village has 7.9 mu, and the overall average for one town and four villages is 10.4 mu. However, on our survey form, the original intention was to understand how many mu of land the majority of farm households can actually cultivate. Therefore, we asked, "What is the size of the most common farm in this village?" hoping that the answer with the highest frequency could represent the general reality and be more accurate than the average. The survey results showed that, except for Xiaoling Village, which has a slightly larger area of 19.1 mu, the others are all around 15 mu. The average for one town and four villages is only 15.9 mu. Details are in the table below:</p>
<p>Attached Table (II)</p>
<p>Average Common Farm Size per Household in One Town and Four Villages of Jiangning, Jiangsu (1935 Survey)</p>
<p>Town/Village Name: Moling Town, Xiaoling Village, Renling Village, Xinling Village, Ailing Village, Total</p>
<p>Number of Villages Surveyed: 11, 14, 21, 26, 17, 89</p>
<p>Total Common Farm Area: 174, 267, 324, 384, 264, 1413</p>
<p>Average Farm Area per Household: 15.8, 19.1, 15.4, 14.8, 15.5, 15.9</p>
<p>Attached Table (I) shows that each farm household has an average of 4.68 people, while the farm area in the above table is less than 16 mu per household. And in terms of the average, each household has only 10.4 mu. By comparing these figures, readers can know how serious the problem of the imbalance between population and land in the area is, and the impact of this imbalance on the lives of farmers is even more significant. This material will be published separately after analysis is complete, to provide further evidence.</p>
<p>(VI) Concluding Remarks</p>
<p>The population pressure in one town and four villages of Jiangning County is becoming increasingly serious, and the total land area is insufficient for cultivation. This is the biggest reason for the decline of the local rural economy and the hardship of farmers' lives! Moreover, the cultivable land is decreasing daily, while the population increase is in full swing. If this continues, the future worries will be even deeper!</p>
<p>In 1934, the author used the method of correspondence to investigate the trend of population and cultivated land increase and decrease in 22 provinces including Chahar over the past 60 years. The result showed that the population increase index was 131, while the land increase index was only 101 (see the Agricultural Report published by the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute). This is in line with the above survey of one town and four villages of Jiangning County, and the trends are similar. We believe that the people of the country should quickly wake up to this terrible reality! How to shift the focus of increasing population size to the path of improving population quality is the most urgent task. Other measures such as improving agriculture and increasing production are also important issues in terms of land. To complete this great mission, the initial work should be to promote a full recognition of this crisis among the people of the country, and those who are responsible for social education need to work even harder.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Shortage of Copper Coins in Tianjin - Market Panic and Stagnant Turnover - <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Due to the unrest in Tianjin and rumors, the authorities are preoccupied with maintaining local security and have no time to take care of finance. Ten days ago, due to the order to replace cash with banknotes in Tianjin, a group of traitors took advantage of the rumors to make profits, resulting in soaring prices and a shortage of copper coins. The Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau immediately tried their best to restrict high prices and stipulated that one national currency could be exchanged for 500 copper coins. At first, the shops in the Chinese Concession outwardly obeyed but inwardly disobeyed, all engaging in hoarding, causing the market price to remain between 460 and 470 coins per national currency. Later, after the Public Security Bureau arrested dozens of merchants who profited regardless of the overall situation and imposed fines and confiscated the hoarded copper coins, the market price became more stable. However, in various concessions, because the authority of the authorities did not reach, many still arbitrarily manipulated the market. The Belgian Tram Company also advertised that passengers must purchase tickets with copper coins, otherwise they would rather let people sit for free for one stop and ask them to get off at the next stop, and were unwilling to give change in copper coins. As the authorities are discussing with the banking industry to issue copper coin notes, and other pseudo-autonomy movements have emerged in the city, people are panicked. Certain foreigners took the opportunity to manipulate the market price and deliberately hoard copper coins, causing a shortage of copper coins and inconvenience in change, putting the poor in a difficult situation. With the riots breaking out, the copper coin exchange rate is even more chaotic. As of today, within the concessions, each yuan has been exchanged for 380 or 400 coins, and the highest price is no more than 430 coins. Outside the concessions, shops dare not violate the official legal price orders, so they all tend to absorb but not release. When purchasing goods with jiao notes, no matter how many copper coins are needed for change, they would rather sacrifice business and not let copper coins flow out. As a result, few copper coins circulate on the market, and most shops have to use stamps instead of cash, or issue paper slips with the words "a certain number of copper coins are stored." There are also those who use bamboo sticks to write the number of copper coins as a substitute. However, the paper slips and bamboo sticks issued by one store are not accepted by another store, and the poor find it very difficult to buy things. Unscrupulous merchants also use the issuance of paper slips and bamboo sticks as a pre-arranged transaction to do more business, imitating each other, almost becoming a fashion in the Chinese Concession. The inconvenient situation is beyond words. The Ninth District Autonomy Construction Office, in accordance with the merchants' wishes, convened a joint meeting of district directors on the 27th and decided to submit a request to the Municipal Government to urge the banking industry to issue copper coins as soon as possible to facilitate circulation, and to formulate a more effective method before the copper coin notes are officially issued to provide relief. Although the Tianjin Reserve Fund Custody Committee has been established, and the transport of cash from Tianjin to the south has been stopped, and the outflow has been effectively checked by the joint efforts of all parties, it has been confirmed that there is no causal relationship with the soaring copper coin price and the lack of spot goods.</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of copper coin notes, after the leaders of the Tianjin Banking and Money Exchange Association discussed the results in Ping, a Hebei Provincial Copper Coin Note Issuance Reserve was specially formed, with branches in Tianjin and Baoding. The first batch of copper coins issued was agreed to be the old copper coin notes stored by the Hebei Provincial Bank that had not been issued, totaling 300,000 yuan, stamped with the seal of the reserve for substitute use. The capital totaled 200,000 yuan, jointly funded by the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, the Tianjin Banking Association, the Tianjin Money Exchange Association, the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, the Beijing Banking Association, and the Beijing Money Exchange Association. Nineteen articles of the organization charter of the issuance reserve have been formulated. Zhou Zuomin has recently contacted the Hebei Provincial Bank, but there is no definite date when it can be implemented and circulated.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang News: Since the central government implemented legal tender, unscrupulous merchants in various places have occasionally exchanged cash silver and secretly transported it. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has telegraphed all administrative commissioners' offices and county governments to strictly prevent this. Except for the cash silver transported by designated exchange agencies to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications for exchange into legal tender, if private transportation of cash silver out of the country is discovered, it will be detained, the perpetrators will be arrested, and the matter will be investigated and dealt with seriously. In counties in this province where there are no branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, or Bank of Communications, it is quite difficult to exchange legal tender. In addition to the exchange by county governments and collection agencies, the Provincial Government has also ordered the Jiangsu Bank and the Farmers Bank to exchange on their behalf. The designated counties are as follows: Wujiang, Qingpu, Gaocun, Liyang, Jiading, Yixing, Fengxian, Kunshan, Nanhui, Chuansha, Chongming, Baoshan, Jinshan, Lianshui, Dianhua, Suqian, Liuyang, Funing, Suining, Fengxian, Jiangning (all of the above counties are exchanged by the local Farmers Bank), Jingjiang, Xiaoxian (exchanged by both the Farmers Bank and the Jiangsu Bank), Pixian, Peixian (exchanged by the Xuzhou Farmers Bank), Lishui, Jiangpu, Jurong (exchanged by both the Nanjing Jiangsu Bank and the Farmers Bank), Yizheng, Yangzhong (exchanged by both the Zhenjiang Farmers Bank and the Jiangsu Bank), Siyang (exchanged by both the Qingjiang Jiangsu Bank and the Farmers Bank).</p>
<p>In addition, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce believes that since the implementation of legal tender in this port, the market has shown obvious signs of activity. However, various shops have suffered from the impact of the recession for a long time and have been desolate. This adjustment is truly the grand purpose of enriching the country and benefiting merchants. Although commerce can be active, the key lies in financial turnover. At present, the banking industry, in view of the past state of social depression, mostly only stores and does not release, causing great blows to our commerce. Now that the legal tender policy has been implemented and commerce has become active, this chamber of commerce, in order to consider the difficulties of merchants, has decided to write to all banks requesting them to release pledge loans as much as possible in order to facilitate turnover and revitalize commerce. The standing committee will also convene the responsible persons of various banks to discuss methods to ensure the permanent activity of commerce. (27th)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Efficiency and Methods of Elementary Education <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yan-yin, Section Chief of the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Education is like manufacturing, and those who receive education are like manufactured goods. Manufacturers always hope to produce excellent products, and those in charge of education also hope to educate ideal citizens or talents. To produce excellent products, there must be good methods, that is, on the principle of economy, using the most economical methods to seek the greatest efficiency. The implementation of education is also the same; it must use the most economical methods to seek the greatest efficiency. Therefore, efficiency and methods are often related and linked. Simply wanting to obtain the greatest efficiency without considering methods often leads to groping in the dark, wasting manpower in worthless sacrifices, the so-called "twice the effort, half the result," "doing a lot of work but not pleasing anyone." Simply seeking changes in methods without considering the improvement of efficiency often results in emptiness and superficiality, which is also "doing a lot of work but not pleasing anyone." Therefore, methods and efficiency should be given equal importance and should be made into a direct proportional relationship.</p>
<p>Method is the necessary condition for organizing things, organizing things, and achieving understanding of certain things. If there is no method, the understanding of things will not be clear or correct. This is common sense that logic tells us. In education, method is equally important. Dewey said, "Method is the economical order of education." Once education has a goal, we must use the most economical method to achieve it.</p>
<p>Method is especially important in elementary education. Because the object of elementary education is children, and children are like a piece of uncultivated land. What kind of soil is suitable for planting what kind of plants in this piece of land? What kind of fertilizer should be applied? Everything must go through a series of investigations, observations, and experiments. Not only that, but because children's intelligence and physical strength have not yet fully developed, and their acquired experience and knowledge are not yet rich, so in teaching children, special attention should be paid to methods.</p>
<p>In the past few decades of elementary education in China, at first, methods were not emphasized. At that time, the general elementary schools in the cities were like most of the village elementary schools now, not paying attention to methods at all, only knowing how to instill, inject, and force memorization into children, reading books all day long; after children graduated, they only obtained a little knowledge from books, which had nothing to do with their life skills and had no effect. This kind of education, because it had no method, also had no real efficiency at all.</p>
<p>Of course, going on to higher education was still possible, and getting a job was still possible, but the citizens or talents cultivated at that time could not carry burdens on their shoulders or lift baskets in their hands; they were still just like the scholar-officials or quasi-scholar-officials who came from the imperial examinations, and they were not of much benefit to the country and society. After the first year of the Republic of China, we worked in the attached elementary school of the Jiangsu Provincial First Normal School in Suzhou. Because Mr. Yu Ziyi and others advocated it, we gradually began to pay attention to teaching methods. But the power was too isolated. At that time, many new methods being tried out in the attached elementary school of the First Normal School were often ridiculed as novelty tricks, and local elementary schools almost avoided contact with us. Later, the Nanjing Higher Normal School was established, and a group of students who had studied education in the United States returned to the country to work as teachers, greatly promoting new education. After the South Higher Normal School was changed to Southeast University, the wave of advocacy became even higher. The attached elementary school of the First Normal School and the attached elementary school of Southeast University were only slightly valued by people, and they were regarded as the source of new education. After Dewey came to China, the call for new education was even more "noisy," so elementary school teachers active in the Jiangsu area worked hard to study methods, so-called "project-based teaching method," "Dalton plan," "individualized teaching method," and what "cooperative teaching method," each trying to be innovative and using new methods to call for attention. At that time, books on the study of teaching methods were also published a lot, like bamboo shoots after a rain: for example, "Original Theory of Educational Methods," "Psychology of Learning," "Educational Psychology," "Curriculum Theory," "Children's Theory," really a lot. The child-centered and popularized elementary school textbooks, the surge in supplementary reading materials for elementary schools, and various scientific experiments on educational issues were all discovered during this period. It cannot be said that this was one of the most progressive periods in elementary education in our country. But this also seems to fit the old saying, "Everything has its advantages and disadvantages." Many elementary schools, because the methods have changed too much, the increase in efficiency is also very ordinary, and like playing tricks, there are indeed those who only change tricks and do not talk about reality. For example, every school implements the project-based teaching method, but "everyone can play magic tricks, but each has different skills." As a result, it is empty, superficial, and wastes a lot of math time in vain. After the success of the Kuomintang (?), some schools still study teaching methods; however, the efficiency has not been obvious, and a group of new members are one hundred percent distrustful, thinking that educational methods are also in the ranks of counter-revolutionaries being revolutionized; therefore, they are noisily only heard scolding "interest theory," scolding "education has no results," scolding "only knows how to imitate the United States," scolding "no central idea," scolding "only knows child-centered, forgetting national-centered (?)", even scolding "bird language and beast language," scolding "schools are not as good as private schools." Advocating restoration, advocating reading the Three Character Classic, advocating reading the classics, in short. It is really "liable to be blamed for every move." With such an atmosphere, methods naturally declined. When economic bankruptcy became acute, the promotion of joint examinations and random examinations, and the emphasis on reviewing homework by supervisors, elementary schools became factories that only sought fast production and good-looking forms. Being able to graduate early, pass the exam, and escape the criticism of the supervisors was considered to have achieved considerable efficiency in education. May I ask, what is the difference between this kind of efficiency and the educational efficiency of the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China? We only need to compare the current efficiency of education with the goals of elementary education in our country to see the difference immediately. The goals of elementary education in our country are clearly analyzed in the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education: First, to cultivate healthy physical bodies for children; second, to cultivate good character in children; third, to develop children's aesthetic interests; fourth, to increase children's life skills; fifth, to train children's work habits; sixth, to enlighten children's scientific thinking; seventh, to cultivate children's spirit of mutual assistance and unity; eighth, to cultivate children's concept of loving the country and loving the group. Now let us look at the results of children's education. Except for character and spirit, which are very difficult to see: First, according to the physical examinations in Shanghai and Nanjing, the results show that more than 80% of the children in school have diseases, indicating that the children's physical bodies are not healthy. Perhaps it is because they pay too much attention to reading, which has increased hunchbacks and nearsightedness. Second, they do paper work all day long, putting art, music, and crafts behind them; aesthetic interests have not been developed; life skills have not been increased; work habits have not been cultivated; and scientific thinking is even more impossible to talk about. As for the concept of loving the country and loving the group, it seems to have increased somewhat compared to before, but this cannot be entirely attributed to education; it can only be said that it is the result of the intensified oppression of external forces in recent years. We must know that the goals of elementary education cannot be considered reached by relying on excellent grades in daily exams and the large number of admissions to higher education; these efficiencies, at most, are just the acquisition of knowledge, and whether this knowledge is necessary for life is still a question.</p>
<p>Education should emphasize efficiency, and we must seek the greatest efficiency from the most economical methods. But how do we judge whether a method is economical or not, and whether the efficiency is large or not? Here, I will explain it again:</p>
<p>The first method of elementary education is to be based on psychology. Psychology tells us about the phenomena of mental life. The emergence of these phenomena is not accidental, but is related to innate heredity and acquired environment. Innate heredity, although not valued by most educators now in psychology, the difference in intelligence is still greatly related to heredity. For example, mental retardates and idiots are mostly caused by their parents or ancestors suffering from syphilis or mental illness. If educators do not understand this point and do not investigate this point clearly, and mistakenly treat ordinary children as mental retardates or idiots, then the teaching method will go astray and will not be economical. Environment is especially important in teaching methods: it is useless to talk to children in villages about cars and trams without showing them models or letting them experiment; after talking a lot, they may still be at a loss. It is useless to talk to urban children about farming and weeding without going to observe and work in the field, even if you describe it vividly, the children will still be at a loss. Making children at a loss is wasting children's mental energy, which is also very uneconomical.</p>
<p>Psychology also tells us that the order of psychological development is the association between stimulus and response. Therefore, we should give children appropriate stimuli based on their psychological development. For example, in teaching lower-grade children to recognize words, those who do not understand child psychology only know to teach children to read and write words; however, this method is not easy to generate efficiency, and forcing children to memorize words still results in forgetting. This is uneconomical. Psychology tells us: children's thinking is whole, and to recognize new things, we must use old experiences. For example, in teaching children to recognize words, the teacher does not have to use textbooks first, but can tell an interesting story or fact, and then the teacher can string together the important materials in the story into sentences and write them on the blackboard to make the children recognize the sentences. In this way, the sentences that the children recognize are related to what they have said, and it is much easier for them to learn. We all know that things related to ourselves are always easy to attract our attention, so we must tailor the teaching materials to children's lives. This is economical. Psychology can indicate many places where teaching methods can be used, but there is not enough time to list them all here. In short, the method based on child psychology is the most economical method, which cannot be argued.</p>
<p>Second, the method of elementary education must be based on biology. Biology can tell us the order of children's physical and mental development. The development of children's intelligence, emotions, reasoning ability, etc. all have a certain order. Fragile brains cannot withstand strong stimuli, and children with unrich understanding are naturally weak in reasoning ability. Therefore, children cannot understand classical Chinese during childhood, and cannot understand the great principles in the classics, history, philosophy, and collections. Children's physical bodies have not yet fully developed, and they cannot be asked to sit in the classroom all day long. Sexual function will definitely develop in the future. If they are not given a little sexual knowledge, they will be led astray in the future. Therefore, educators must also understand biology. Understanding children from the study of biology and making good use of methods is also the most economical method. Here is an additional explanation: that is, psychology is developed based on biology. In the past, biology was included in psychology. In recent years, they have been separated for study. The so-called experimental psychology is a major work in biology.</p>
<p>Third, the method of elementary education must be based on scientific experiments. The improvement of methods lies in experiments, and experiments must have scientific methods. Do not be superstitious about the ancients, and do not be slaves to the authority of anyone. All problems must be solved with scientific methods. For example, in Chinese language teaching methods, which is faster, reading aloud or reading silently? Which is more useful, reciting or understanding? Which is more convenient, checking dictionaries, radicals or numbers? We can all use scientific methods to experiment and find out the results, and then implement them. In this way, the efficiency of teaching can naturally be increased. Using scientific methods is also the most economical method.</p>
<p>As for examining the efficiency of elementary education, we also have two sciences to use as a basis: (1) to be based on pedagogy, (2) to be based on sociology. Pedagogy and sociology can both tell us the due goals of education. Psychology and biology are like the rudder and oars on a ship, which can make the ship turn left and right and move forward. Pedagogy and sociology are like the compass on a ship, which can indicate the direction of the ship. Pedagogy is also developed based on sociology. What kind of society, what kind of pedagogy is produced. What kind of society is China now? What should the education of our country be based on to establish goals? This is something that those who care about society and study society all know, and I will not say more about it.</p>
<p>Goals and efficiency cannot be confused. But the goal is a ruler, which can measure the amount of efficiency. So if we want to talk about the efficiency of education, we have to use goals as a measure.</p>
<p>Elementary education is a kind of preliminary education, and its object is immature children. Therefore, on the one hand, we must consider the efficiency of education, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to the methods of education. Otherwise, only seeking efficiency without method is really "fishing in trees"; on the contrary, only talking about method without talking about efficiency is also "a blind man riding a blind horse," so efficiency and method are inseparable. Finally, I repeat, "Education should use the most economical methods to obtain the greatest efficiency."</p>

<h3 id="e70">Wuxi: Silver Coins Disappear from the Market <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order nationwide to implement the non-convertible policy, unscrupulous merchants have seized the opportunity to seek personal gain at the expense of violating laws and regulations and harming the Republic of China. They have been buying up silver coins everywhere and reselling them to a certain country in order to make profits. Therefore, police stations in various counties have been uncovering cases of smuggling silver coins every day. In the Wuxi area, merchants have recently been privately collecting hard currency from various businesses, adding a premium of ten cents to thirty-seven cents per yuan. Fortunately, the public security authorities have strictly investigated and prohibited this, so there have been no thefts. Silver coins have now disappeared from the market and are mostly replaced by legal tender. However, silver coins have also disappeared, and the reason is that they have all been collected by unscrupulous merchants to hoard and speculate for profit. In view of this, the Public Security Bureau reissued instructions yesterday, strictly prohibiting unscrupulous buying and selling.</p>

An Hanwen also confessed that he had attempted to rob Da Songfen, Nannen County, with Wu Shunxing and Jin Zhixian five or six days ago, but failed. At the end of August, he also robbed Qiao Zhirong and Qiao Huirong of ninety-four yuan in paper money with Zhang Anan, Li Changfu, and Wen Lunren using a wooden pistol west of the Workers' Education Center in the West Gate. After obtaining the confession, Officer Su led the police to investigate and arrest the above criminals together. Since the case involved habitual thieves and was serious, they were immediately transferred to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Public Security Bureau Strictly Investigates Strange Advertisements <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The local Wuxi newspaper published an advertisement on the 27th of this month for recruiting six secretaries, aged between 20 and 30, with a monthly salary of 60 yuan, located at No. 15 Sanhuang Street, signed by the Examination Committee. After this advertisement was published, many people applied and requested regulations because of the excellent treatment. After seeing the advertisement, the County Public Security Bureau, considering that its wording was vague and the so-called Examination Committee was unknown, sent a secretary, Fang Zhihao, to investigate secretly. It turned out that the head of the household there was Fan Yunzhang, who was ill and in debt. According to his niece, Chen Huifen, it was issued by Xie Qingyun, a friend of her brother Chen Tianjue. Xie lived in the Railway Hotel, etc. However, after waiting for a long time, he did not arrive. After inquiring at the Railway Hotel, they also said that he had disappeared. It was also heard that Xie was from Beiping, had previously studied at Soochow Middle School, and had just graduated from the Japanese Military Academy. He had been in Wuxi for a short time. The Public Security Bureau is now conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Ministry of Finance: Supporting the Revival of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce, Revitalizing the Economy, Instructing the Three Banks to Allow Agreements on Overdraft Limits with Various Banks <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the proposals submitted by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications on overdraft methods for fellow banks and incentive methods for fellow banks to collect cash currency, the Ministry of Finance has approved them for implementation. The instructions are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Central Bank: A letter to the Central Bank states that the proposal submitted by Chen Guangfu and others, after joint discussion with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, on adjusting industrial finance and concentrating private cash, regarding four overdraft methods for fellow banks, one incentive method for fellow banks to collect cash currency, and three matters that the three banks themselves should discuss and decide, requesting instructions. After reviewing the four overdraft methods for fellow banks and one incentive method for fellow banks to collect cash currency jointly discussed by the three banks, it is found that they are feasible and should be approved for implementation. However, the use of this overdraft should be limited to the revival and development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce. As for (1) the total overdraft amount, it should be determined according to the needs of the market; (2) the share of the three banks should still be distributed according to the method of maintaining money market loans, with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications sharing 4, 4, and 2; (3) joint custody of collateral and the establishment of overdraft accounts according to shares are appropriate. In addition to issuing instructions and separate orders, you are hereby requested to investigate and handle the matter in conjunction with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications.</p>
<p>Order to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications: An order to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications states that a memorandum is submitted, jointly discussed by the three banks, on adjusting industrial finance and concentrating private cash, and the three banks themselves should discuss and decide on matters that should be jointly negotiated, requesting compliance. The memorandum has been read. After reviewing the four overdraft methods for fellow banks and one incentive method for fellow banks to collect cash currency jointly discussed by the bank with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, it is found that they are feasible and should be approved for implementation. However, the use of this overdraft should be limited to the revival and development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce. As for (1) the total overdraft amount, it should be determined according to the needs of the market; (2) the share of the three banks should still be distributed according to the method of maintaining money market loans, with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications sharing 4, 4, and 2; (3) joint custody of collateral and the establishment of overdraft accounts according to shares are appropriate. In addition to issuing instructions and separate orders, this order is issued to order you to comply and handle the matter in conjunction with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications.</p>
<p>Order to Chen, Zhou, etc.: An order to Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, and Zhou Zuomin, Chairman of the Beiping Banking Association, states that the memorandum on adjusting industrial finance and concentrating private cash previously submitted in person, regarding promoting legal tender, collecting cash, and supporting the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce, is quite important and has been handed over to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications for joint review. A reply is now recorded stating that the three banks have been convened to jointly discuss the measures and are now submitting them separately as follows: (1) Fellow banks requesting overdrafts from the three banks should submit in writing the types of collateral, the value of the overdraft amount, and the overdraft period for review by the three banks. (1) The six items of overdraft collateral originally proposed: (A) public bonds, treasury bills, and certificates approved for issuance by the central government; (B) commercial paper and import and export bills of exchange; (C) real estate, industrial plants, factory machinery, factory buildings, and bases; (D) goods warehouse receipts; (E) bonds, treasury certificates, and public bonds issued by the joint preparatory committee of the Shanghai Banking Association; (F) bonds of companies with reliable guarantees and listed company stocks. Of the above six items, except for item (C), the other five items (A, B, D, E, F) can be accepted. Regarding item (C) collateral, it should be stipulated that it has been reviewed and certified by the three banks as having been done before this measure, and a formal valuation certificate must be submitted. (1) All procedures for overdraft collateral should be handled in accordance with precedents. (1) During the overdraft period, if the market's chips are loose, the three banks plan to consider the situation and negotiate with the overdraft parties to reduce the amount or return it. (1) In order to encourage fellow banks to collect cash currency, it is proposed that after fellow banks deliver 60,000 yuan in cash currency, they will be allowed an overdraft amount of 40,000 yuan. The overdraft parties should submit collateral and sign an overdraft contract. After reviewing, it is found that it is feasible and should be approved for implementation. The total overdraft amount should be determined by the three banks based on the needs of the market and allocated according to shares. However, the use of this overdraft should be limited to the revival and development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce. In addition to issuing orders to the three banks to handle the matter jointly, you are hereby notified and instructed to pass this on to all fellow banks.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Petition for Relief of Domestic Industry <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Presented by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday presented a petition to the Ministry of Finance stating: This petition concerns a matter of factual reporting. On the 25th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Steamship Industry Association stating that recently, industry and commerce have been declining, all trades are in decay, imports are increasing daily, production is decreasing daily, resulting in the city's financial situation being on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, our government has seen this and has reformed the currency system, resolutely implementing orders. Since the announcement, the economy has shown activity, and foreign exchange has gradually stabilized. This is indeed a good sign of turning danger into safety. The government, in order to supply the needs of industry and commerce, will reform and improve the banking system, find ways to increase its liquidity, so that its capital is abundant, and will also establish real estate mortgage banks and amend real estate mortgage laws to revitalize real estate. This is an especially good policy for saving the times and a crucial plan for economic recovery. All our merchants and people praise it in unison. We have found that economic recovery begins with revitalizing industry. To revitalize industry, it is necessary to reduce interest rates first. Now the government's economic concentration, for the purpose of establishing special banks and setting minimum interest rates specifically to relieve industry, is more than capable. However, although the plan has been predetermined, it has not yet been put into practice. It is urgent that various groups convene to discuss and petition the government to implement it as soon as possible, in order to help industry and avoid missing the opportunity. For this reason, we have prepared this letter and respectfully request that you consider it carefully and promptly convene various industry associations to hold practical discussions and jointly devise a plan. This matter was submitted to the 70th regular meeting of the affiliated associations on the 28th of this month for discussion. Everyone agreed that since the implementation of the currency management policy, reserves have been concentrated, and the economy has gradually stabilized. However, upon reviewing various domestic industries, there is still a lack of funds, and they have not been able to flourish. It is imperative to find ways to provide relief. It was resolved to forward this matter to your ministry for review and instructions. As for the request to convene various industry associations for discussion, it will be postponed temporarily. Meanwhile, letters will be sent to various industries to solicit opinions, which will be compiled and reported to your ministry for decision. These matters have been recorded and are now reported to you. We respectfully request your review and instructions, as this would be in the public interest.</p>
<p>Presentations from Various Associations: Seventy-odd trade associations, including the Yarn Industry Association, dispatched representatives Gu Xinyi, Lao Jingxiu, Luo Qinghua, Wen Lanting, Zhu Wenqi, Zheng Chengqing, Ke Ganchen, Jin Runxiang, Ma Jiliang, Zhou Bangjun, and ten others at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. They carried a petition to the Central Bank to petition Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi for relief of industry. Deputy Minister Xu Kan received them. First, the representatives described the state of decline of Shanghai's industry and commerce and requested: (1) Order the Central Bank to handle rediscounting; (2) Order the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to re-mortgage real estate, such as factory land and factory property. Deputy Minister Xu agreed to handle rediscounting and stated that arrangements had been made with various banks for real estate mortgages, with the three banks providing overdraft facilities to various banks. At 1:00 PM, Minister Kong Xiangxi received them. He stated that the Central Bank would handle rediscounting immediately and that the market situation would stabilize after the end of the Gregorian calendar year, with no problems anticipated. They left at around 2:00 PM, and the results were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Business Leaders Meet with Kong: Shanghai industrialists Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, Rong Zongjing, Guo Shun, Nie Lusheng, and five others went to the Central Bank at 11:00 AM yesterday morning to meet with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to petition him. They were received. First, Yu Qiaqing described the state of decline of industry and commerce and requested: (1) Please ask the government to quickly establish special banks, or first have the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications allocate large sums of money to relieve industry so that various business owners can fully utilize all their capital; (2) Please ask the Central Bank to lower market interest rates and find ways to recover high-interest bonds to encourage the general public to invest in industry. They left at 12:00 PM. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Yu, Liu, Rong, and others at the Central Bank. They said that the results of the meeting were very satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Municipal Public Security Bureau: Re-census Completed; Card Compilation Work to be Finished Within the Year <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau's re-census, which began on the 16th, ended yesterday. The bureau plans to compile household and individual cards from the collected materials within this month. Individuals with criminal records will also have special cards made for investigation purposes. The compilation will be completed within the year. The details are reported below:</p>
<p>Re-census Completed Yesterday</p>
<p>In order to understand the living conditions and activities of the people of Shanghai and to distinguish between good and bad, the Municipal Public Security Bureau launched a city-wide re-census on the 16th of this month. Teams, squads, and groups were organized, mobilizing over 1,100 police officers. Within the jurisdictions of each branch bureau and station, police officers distributed household survey forms to ordinary households, boat dwellers, and temples. Public places and foreigners were sent letters requesting them to fill out designated survey forms. As of yesterday, the household survey forms have been collected in order, and public places and foreigners have also submitted them. Therefore, the re-census survey work can be considered complete.</p>
<p>Card Compilation Work to be Completed Within the Year</p>
<p>After the survey work is completed, the bureau plans to spend the time from the beginning to the end of this month compiling the cards, aiming to complete the work within the year. First, the submitted survey forms will be sorted, and then household cards and individual cards will be compiled. The front of the household card will include the householder's name, whether they own or rent, the branch bureau, police station, sub-station, or police post, street, road, lane, block, house number, household members' titles, names, aliases, genders, ages, native places, occupations, workplaces, party affiliation, religion, education levels, date of arrival in Shanghai, disabilities and special physical characteristics, and whether they smoke opium or substitutes. The back will include the date and address of relocation: year, month, day, residing at branch bureau, police station, sub-station, or police post, road, lane, block, or street, alley, house number. Individual cards are divided into two types: ordinary individual cards (males marked with blue lines, females marked with red lines), with the front including the name, householder's name, and relationship.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Other Groups Host Song Faxiang Last Night; Yu Zuoting Delivers a Speech Hoping to Promote Domestic Goods Overseas; Plan to Establish a China Pavilion in Batavia, Funding is Being Discussed <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted Consul-General Song at the Bank Club at 6:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Zhu is scheduled to leave the country on the 5th to return to his post. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>List of Attendees: Attendees included Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, Song Faxiang, Chen Zheqing, Pan Guangjiong, Zhu Boyuan, Song Yizhong, Wang Zhisheng, Gu Huaibing, He Bingxian, Li Qiaozhi, Cai Shengbai of Meya Silk Weaving Factory, Xue Fuji of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, Le Rucheng of Taikang Food Company, Ren Shigang of Wuhe Weaving Factory, Ye Youcai of Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Xu Xiaochu of Sino-French Pharmacy, Hu Xiyuan of China Yapu Er Bulb Factory, Yang Xiren of Haijing Woolen Mill, Liang Bozhi of Guangming Manufacturing Factory, Xiang Kangyuan of Kangyuan Canning Factory, Fang Yexian of China Chemical Industry Society, Wu YunChu of Tianchu MSG Factory, Fang Jiangge of Zhonghua Enamel Factory, Xu Guanqun of Xin Asia Pharmaceutical Company, Zhang Huikang of Yaguang Manufacturing Factory, Zhang Zuyin.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Yu Zuoting reported that today, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce are welcoming Consul-General Song and inviting representatives from major domestic goods factories in this city to gather here. Consul-General Song is going to Beijing on official business and is representing the Dutch East Indies Chinese Chamber of Commerce Federation, the Dutch East Indies Overseas Chinese Importers' Association, and the Batavia Chinese Chamber of Commerce to Shanghai to discuss matters related to the domestic goods exhibition. Our overseas Chinese compatriots in various ports of Southeast Asia, whether British, Dutch, or French, are numerous. Overseas Chinese compatriots are deeply affected abroad, and their patriotism must be even stronger. The sales of domestic goods in Southeast Asia should be developed, but they have gradually decreased recently, and the entire market will be completely taken over by other countries. In October of this year, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce held a large-scale domestic goods exhibition and promotion conference. However, due to insufficient preparation time, in addition to the hundreds of companies that provided exhibits, not many others sent representatives to promote goods. Our association and others deeply regret this. Currently, the three major organizations in the Dutch East Indies plan to establish a China Pavilion in the Ganbi Pu night market in Batavia in August and September of the 25th year, following the example of Annam, to expand publicity to facilitate the sales of domestic goods. All the details can be reported in detail by Consul-General Song. Our association and others can tell Consul-General Song about the preparations. In short, in Batavia, all matters will be handled by the three major organizations in Batavia; in Shanghai, all matters will be handled by our association to the best of our ability. Regarding funding, the Batavia side has already raised 2,000 to 3,000 Dutch guilders, which will cover the construction of the venue and electricity costs. However, in Shanghai, the expenses for preparations, the accommodation for representatives in Batavia, and the venue layout will require government funding. We wonder if Consul-General Song had any practical solutions after discussing this with the Minister of Industry in Beijing. As for the points that Consul-General Song should pay attention to during the preparation, (1) the types and quantities of goods that can be sold in Batavia must be accurately determined, (2) the import tax rates and price standards in the Dutch East Indies must also be determined to give manufacturers a sufficient grasp and enable sales, (3) the issue of import taxes must be resolved in advance, (4) the issue of discounted shipping (how many people are limited), (5) other measures can be referred to the Singapore Domestic Goods Exhibition.</p>
<p>Mr. Song's Reply: Gentlemen, during this return to China, before my departure, the Dutch East Indies Commercial Federation and other three organizations, in order to actively expand the sales of domestic goods overseas, requested that I ask the central government for subsidies to build a China Pavilion in Batavia to promote domestic goods. It is scheduled to open at the end of August next year during the Dutch East Indies National Day. Because the Annam government has established an Annam Pavilion there for many years to exhibit products, and the results are excellent, the overseas Chinese hope that domestic manufacturers can also go to the Batavia night market to promote domestic goods. After my return to China, I will report everything to Minister Chen. The Minister's opinion is that he strongly supports the expansion of publicity for domestic goods, but due to the central government's finances, he intends to ask the factories to raise their own funds. The consulate can find ways to reduce freight and half-price tickets. At the same time, the overseas Chinese will provide 3,000 guilders as part of the expenses for manufacturers to go abroad. The rest will be borne by the participating manufacturers. Because domestic goods have almost no status in the Dutch East Indies, if this can become a reality, it will not only allow overseas Chinese to recognize domestic goods but also develop foreign trade. I am very honored to be hosted by the Commercial Federation and the Chamber of Commerce. Then Wang Zhisheng reported on his participation in the Singapore National Exhibition. The gathering ended happily at 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Scheduled Departure: Consul-General Song is scheduled to take the overnight express train to Beijing at 11:00 PM today to seek instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He will stay for about two or three days and come to Shanghai on the 4th. On the 5th, he will take the Java Line's Zhisha Danni to leave the country. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city are preparing to participate in the Batavia China Pavilion Domestic Goods Exhibition, so it has been decided to convene the city's factory groups to discuss participation methods.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Eurasia Company's Xi'an-Lanzhou Section Airplane Accident Reported Yesterday; Cause Still Under Investigation; Decision to Switch to Giant Aircraft <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's report of the Eurasia No. 5 aircraft that crashed about ninety kilometers southeast of Pingliang stated that two passengers were injured, and the pilot and mechanic were unfortunately killed. It is now reported that the pilot's name was Xia Lomm, 26 years old, born in Thuringia, Germany. He studied mechanics, telecommunications, and aircraft piloting at the German Civil Aviation School for four years. In 1932, he was introduced by Lufthansa of Germany to Eurasia Airlines as a flight mechanic and telegraph operator, totaling 370,000 kilometers of flight. In the summer of this year, he was promoted to aircraft pilot, flying between Peiping, Zhengzhou, and Lanzhou Baotou, totaling 47,000 kilometers of flight. The mechanic who died at the same time was named Meier, 32 years old, born in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1933, he was introduced by Lufthansa to China and served as a flight mechanic and telegraph operator at Eurasia Airlines, totaling 342,000 kilometers of flight. The cause of the plane crash is still under investigation. It is reported that Eurasia Airlines, in view of the dangerous terrain and unpredictable weather between Xi'an and Lanzhou, will disregard profits and losses and has decided to immediately switch to using three-engine giant aircraft to fly that section. It also telegraphed Germany today to continue renting a giant aircraft, ordering it to fly to China immediately to supplement the fleet.</p>
<p>The above are basically the same as what is filled in on the front of the card, except for the householder's name and relationship, while what is filled in on the back is exactly the same. As for special individual cards, they are used for those with criminal records. The front includes family status and special matters. Special matters include abnormal situations such as sudden wealth or poverty or strange family situations. Special attention is paid to released prisoners and parolees notified by the prison. The back includes facial features and the date of the crime, and a photo is attached for easier investigation. However, compiling the cards is a more complicated procedure, so it will not be completed until the end of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Zhending Cotton Mill Manager, Zhao Dexiong Commits Suicide; Tragically Failed, Struggled to No Avail; Reportedly Related to Courtesan Miss Zhou Manli <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Dexiong, the manager of Zhending Cotton Mill, had a wide circle of friends and was a business tycoon. During the outbreak of the European War in 1917, the source of dyes was scarce, and supply could not meet demand. Zhao Dexiong happened to be operating a dye shop in the interior. With his keen vision, he had accumulated a large amount of indigo blue, which he took the opportunity to sell, immediately reaping huge profits. After becoming rich, Dexiong moved his entire family to Shanghai, hired workers to build a mansion, and connected with local celebrities. Furthermore, in connection with the relationship of repaying military expenses, he formed a sworn brotherhood with General Li Xueyuan. General Li was in a position of power at that time, and everything went smoothly. Dexiong, with his help, then used the theory of saving the country through industry to call on the public to establish Zhending Cotton Mill. Sure enough, with effective management, the business developed day by day. Thus, it increased from one factory to two, then to three, four, and five. However, after the end of the European War, foreigners returned to Shanghai and invested in competition, which became increasingly fierce. Domestic industries suffered blows, and Chinese cotton mills were especially affected. Although Zhao Dexiong struggled, because General Li had already retired and the financial community was seeking self-preservation, he was stretched thin. Dexiong had a relative, Ke Zhi, who had followed him for many years and was quite loyal. Recently, Ke Zhi took the money north to purchase food, hoping for a last-ditch effort to reverse the situation. Suddenly, the sky darkened, and Ke Zhi died in the disaster. Thus, all plans were exhausted, and Zhao Dexiong tragically failed. Zhao Dexiong had been overly stimulated over the years, leading to madness and suicide. It is also rumored that Zhao Dexiong's suicide was due to various reasons, and the courtesan Miss Zhou Huanli, who was his English secretary, was also related. In short, the plot is tortuous and full of dramatic elements, making it good material for a script.</p>
<p>The above is the general plot of the Yihua Company's talkie giant film "Hero of the Times," which will soon be screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater. The film is directed by Mr. Ying Yunwei and stars Hu Ping, Shang Guanwu, Ma Loufen, Ye Juanjuan, Wan Laitian, etc. The results are excellent, especially as the most glorious harvest of domestic films in 1935. As the screening period approaches, we hope people from all walks of life will pay attention.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Ministry of Industry: Measures to Revitalize Industry and Commerce; Request to the Municipal Government for Implementation <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry stated that in view of the declining state of domestic industry and commerce, in order to revitalize them, it has formulated methods that combine both symptomatic and fundamental treatments, implementing controlled trade, promoting domestic goods, and advocating thrift, and has communicated these to the municipal government for earnest implementation in order to revive the national economy. The measures are described below:</p>
<p>Controlled Trade: The Ministry stated that since the domestic economic organization is not sound and industry and commerce are declining, the way to provide relief is to focus on trade regulation to reduce the outflow of cash. It has formulated methods for controlled trade, divided into three steps: (1) Revising tariff rules to increase import tariffs, prevent the dumping of cheap foreign goods, and prevent domestic industry and commerce from suffering damage. (2) Export controls and sound industrial and commercial organization. The state manages the quantity, price, and quality of goods produced according to market supply and demand to meet the conditions of foreign markets. Industries should seek cooperation, mutual financial assistance, and avoid unnecessary competition. There should also be a sound organization to remedy weaknesses in business. Export trade should gradually not rely on foreign merchants. (3) Import restrictions. Our country's current crisis is recognized by all countries. People's purchasing power is decreasing, and imports must also gradually decrease. If, unfortunately, the Chinese economy suffers a final collapse, the business of all countries in China must also come to an end. If import restrictions can be implemented to restore the domestic economy, the business of various countries in China will also benefit, with common prosperity and mutual reliance.</p>
<p>Promoting Domestic Goods: The Ministry stated that the promotion of domestic goods has been implemented for a long time but has not had a deep and significant effect. The important reasons are: (1) it is affected by exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies and domestic disasters, (2) it is due to the lack of patriotism among the people. In the future, we should strive for (1) the complete abolition of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes to remove the shackles on production. Although local governments cannot thoroughly cut exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes due to financial difficulties, the people's productive enterprises cannot develop, and industry and commerce and finance will fall into ruin. We should supervise local officials to focus on reducing the burden on merchants and the people. (2) The stimulation of the people's patriotism is of great importance. We should have the spirit of strongly supporting national plans, sacrificing personal enjoyment, and purchasing domestic goods to promote the development of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Thrift Movement: The Ministry stated that when the country and the people's economy are impoverished, consumption should be reduced to save them from danger. Currently, domestic industry and commerce are not developed, and the level of national life is increasing day by day. The general inability to produce affects the unemployed, which are countless. However, urban people are accustomed to using foreign goods, and the result of expanded consumption is that most of the money flows out. Domestic goods are sluggish due to poor sales and cannot recover. We should urgently promote the national thrift movement, implement self-sufficiency, reduce the import surplus of foreign goods, and save the collapse of the national economy.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reported that this time, the rebellious Yin Rugeng falsely used his name and willingly became a national traitor, arousing the anger of people across the country. The reporter met with Yin's brother, Yin Ruli, yesterday and asked about Yin Rugeng's betrayal. According to Yin Ruli, his brother's actions are absurd. He had no prior knowledge and could not dissuade him. He is very heartbroken and only hopes that he will wake up early, correct his mistakes, and repay the people. Yin's nephew, Yin Tiyang, is currently a professor at Peking University. Seeing his uncle betray the country, he was extremely angry and resigned from his position to come to Shanghai. It is said that Yin Rugeng intended to appoint him as the head of the fake foreign affairs office. By chance, Huo Shi, who was heading south, had already introduced him to Peng Xuepei, the head of the Political Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan, to report everything.</p>
<h3 id="e88">U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Cunningham, Retired Yesterday, to be Temporarily Replaced by Mr. Davis <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The "Great American Evening Post" reports that Mr. Cunningham, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, who has served for sixteen years, officially retired today (30th) and is preparing to return to his country on December 21st. Mr. Cunningham has been in the U.S. consular service for thirty-eight years, having served in Aden, Berchem, Bombay, Singapore, Hankou, and other places. From December 1st, Mr. Davis, the former U.S. Consul General in Stockholm, Sweden, will temporarily take charge of the Shanghai U.S. Consulate. Mr. Davis has been in the Shanghai office for almost a year. Mr. Cunningham has been the head of the consular corps in Shanghai for ten years. From tomorrow, this position will belong to Mr. Aall, the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai. From tomorrow, Mr. Cunningham will be taking care of personal matters, visiting friends, and packing his luggage. After arriving in the U.S., he plans to return to his hometown of Menominee, Michigan, with no other plans. Mr. Cunningham told a friend today, "I am now retired, so I have no plans." He also said that besides knowing that the position of U.S. Consul General will be temporarily taken over by Mr. Davis, he had not heard who the successor would be. According to regulations, Mr. Cunningham's term should expire on December 31st. The report that Mr. Jacobs will succeed Mr. Cunningham was found to be inaccurate after investigation today. Mr. Jacobs previously served in China. On July 2, 1934, he was transferred to be a Foreign Affairs Inspector, with the title of Consul General. He has traveled to the Near East, India, the Straits Settlements, and other places. It is said that he is currently en route to Australia and will come to China to inspect consular affairs, but will not arrive before next spring. As far as the officialdom knows, Mr. Jacobs has not been appointed to any specific position in Shanghai, but is only coming here for inspection. Mr. Davis has also served as a Foreign Affairs Inspector and has extensive experience in consular affairs. He has a wide circle of friends in Shanghai, and his friends have already congratulated him on taking up the new position today.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Forced Registration of Smokers Ends This Month; Second Round of Raids Today <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau ordered all branches to intensify crackdowns, according to Da Gong She. Since the Shanghai Public Security Bureau began the forced registration of smokers last month, it has worked hard on publicity, persuasion, and crackdowns, with significant results. Now that the deadline for forced registration is approaching at the end of this month, the bureau, in order to avoid any loopholes, has decided to conduct a second round of raids starting today and is actively preparing to establish a smoking cessation hospital, which is to be established before the 15th of this month. In addition, the city's youth propaganda team is also scheduled to hold an expanded anti-smoking propaganda campaign on the 4th. Details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Forced Registration Ends This Month</p>
<p>The registration of smokers in this city is carried out in accordance with the regulations issued by the Chairman's Office of the Military Affairs Commission for the registration of smoking households within a specified period. It started on July 1st of this year, with smokers registering voluntarily. Forced registration started on October 1st. Over the past five months, nearly 30,000 smokers have voluntarily registered or have been found and ordered to register by the Public Security Bureau, of which more than 4,000 have applied for treatment. As of yesterday, in addition to the 2,250 people who have already been sent for treatment and the 1,669 people who have quit smoking, there are still more than 2,000 people waiting to be sent for treatment. The bureau has now decided to stop registration at the end of this year. From January 1st next year, smokers who are found to have not registered will be punished according to regulations and will be detained and forced to quit.</p>
<p>Second Round of Raids Starts Today</p>
<p>In addition to expanding the publicity of the dangers of smoking, investigating smokers, and persuading them to register, the bureau is also very active in cracking down on smoking. In addition to ordering all branch offices to pay attention to the arrest, and assigning personnel to conduct regular inspections at all land and water transportation docks, a special crackdown team has been established. The first crackdown started on the 5th of last month and ended on the 20th, resulting in the arrest of more than 800 smoking offenders, with excellent results. The second crackdown has been scheduled to start today. Yesterday, orders were specifically issued to police officers in various branches to strictly investigate and assist in the crackdown to avoid loopholes. It is reported that the crackdown will last for one month. After the forced registration ends, crackdowns will continue at any time, and privately operated smoking dens will be strictly investigated to thoroughly eliminate them.</p>
<p>Smoking Cessation Hospital Established Mid-Month</p>
<p>The bureau previously believed that the North and South Shanghai Smoking Cessation Hospitals were not sufficient to accommodate smokers, so it specially requested approval from the municipal government and the health bureau to jointly establish a large-scale smoking cessation hospital. Wu, the section chief of the Health Bureau, and Dai, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, surveyed the Gaojing New Village in Jiangwan as the hospital site and drafted a plan and budget, which were submitted to the municipal government for approval. Because the required funds were more than 70,000 yuan, which was difficult to raise, representatives from the Public Security Bureau, Health Bureau, and Finance Bureau were specially convened a few days ago to discuss solutions. It was decided to submit another report for the municipal government to review and handle. Dai, the section chief of the Public Security Bureau, went to the municipal government yesterday to discuss the matter. According to reports, it is still under review and is expected to be established before the 15th of this month to facilitate the sending of smokers for treatment.</p>
<p>Various Groups Assist with Propaganda</p>
<p>The city's youth propaganda team believes that the government's current registration of smokers and the practical ban on smoking are of great significance. In order to show its assistance, the team has agreed with the City Anti-Smoking Association to conduct propaganda. Members have been dispatched to give lectures and persuade people to quit smoking, and they have been very busy. The team has also scheduled a propaganda conference for 7:00 PM on the 4th to expand the propaganda. In addition, the City Public Education Center is also planning to organize a lecture team and a teaching team, using the "little teacher system" to assist the government in its anti-smoking propaganda. The various methods are currently being drafted and will be established and begin work within days.</p>

<p>The Mobile Simple Exhibition of Aviation to Save the Nation, organized by the Shanghai Solicitation Team of the China Aviation Association, opened on the 10th of the previous month at the Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi.

The number of visitors each day has been more than several thousand. In order to increase the interest and knowledge of the audience, the office has also collected air defense and aviation materials and various books from all sides for display.

<h3 id="e97">Tongcheng Vessel Aground in Anhui; Vessel Dispatched Today for Rescue <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Aground Due to Fog. The Tongcheng, a vessel of the local Tongcheng Steamship Company, which is used to transport cargo and coal, was sailing downstream from Tongzibao in the upper reaches of the river. When it reached about twelve nautical miles downstream of Anqing, it encountered heavy fog and the pilot misread the channel, causing it to run aground on a shoal downstream of Anqing. Because it was carrying a large amount of cargo, it became deeply embedded. This happened on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Unable to Escape. After running aground, the Tongcheng shipowner wanted to escape on his own, but he had lost the ability to move. He telegraphed Shanghai for help. The company notified the insurance association, and immediately tried to send a ship to rescue it. However, the water was too shallow and the load was too heavy, so the rescue was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Dispatching a Vessel to Unload Cargo. Yesterday, because the towing was unsuccessful, the Tongcheng Company informed the China Shipping Insurance Federation and discussed other methods. In the afternoon, Tang Danhua, the director of the Federation, said that Tang had agreed with Kang Zhengji in this city yesterday afternoon to allow the dispatch of a barge from Shanghai to Anqing today to open the hatch and unload the coal carried by the Tongcheng vessel to reduce the weight of the ship and then try to tow it.</p>

<p>The Lou Jia Wan Central Police Station of the French Concession, at noon on the 24th of last month, received a report from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and was led by Western detective Bi Ye, along with Chinese detectives Wang Zhihao, Peng Zhengyou, Li Baochang, Yang Weishan, and others, first went to No. 12 Rihui Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, and arrested Yuan Hongsheng, Wang Tugeng, Zhang Dehui, and three other suspects who were selling morphine and red pills. Forty-five small bags of morphine and twenty-five small bags of red pills were seized and taken to the police station. Based on Yuan's confession, they first went to No. 569 Fada Road and arrested Jiang Yongmei, who was wholesaling morphine, and then went to No. 9 Songbai Lane, Liumei Road, and continued to arrest the woman Cao Wangshi and the suspect Wang Jinwu. A bag of morphine weighing about two taels was found behind the back wall of the closet in the rear building, as well as more than seventy yuan in cash from sales. Then, they went to No. 10, Lane 150, Fuxu Road, and arrested Zhang Genxing, who was wholesaling red pills. They then went to the rear building of No. 59, Jule Road, and continued to arrest the young woman Wang Xiuying and the man Yin Peiben, a couple, and found eight bags of red pills, totaling 8,000 pills, under the floor of the rear building, as well as a full set of equipment for manufacturing red pills, and a wooden box with a concealed bottom and a white leather box for transporting the pills. A total of nine male and female criminals were arrested in five places, along with the stolen goods, and taken back to the police station and sent to the Special Second Court for questioning and detention. It was found that Cao Wangshi, Wang Xiuying, and others had also committed similar cases before and had been punished on record. However, no criminal suspicion was found against Zhang Dehui. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiong Huiping of the Special Second Court opened a court session for interrogation. The police lawyer did not prosecute Zhang Dehui, and the remaining defendants were prosecuted in accordance with Article 257 of the Criminal Law for selling and manufacturing opium compounds. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the case and requested permission to transfer Yuan Hongsheng, Wang Tugeng, and Zhang Dehui, three criminals. After the court thoroughly interrogated the defendants and declared the debate closed, a date was set for sentencing. The details of the case related to the transfer request of the Public Security Bureau will be announced at the time of sentencing. This has been reported in detail in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Xiong came to the Third Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the case. After briefly questioning their ages and places of origin, the judgment was announced (details of the crimes omitted). Yin Peiben was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and fined 1,500 yuan. Cao Wangshi was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan. Wang Xiuying was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment and fined 500 yuan. Zhang Genxing was sentenced to four years' imprisonment and fined 200 yuan. Jiang Yongmei was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Yuan Hongsheng was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Wang Tugeng was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for smoking opium compounds. Wang Jinwu was found not guilty. If fines are commuted to labor, Yin Peiben, Cao Wangshi, and Wang Xiuying will be calculated on the basis of the total amount and the number of days in six months, and Zhang Genxing will be calculated at three yuan per day. The seized morphine, red pill equipment, and other items were confiscated and burned. Zhang Dehui was released on bail after completing the necessary procedures and passing the appeal period. Yuan Hongsheng, Wang Tugeng, and Zhang Dehui do not need to be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. During the appeal period, the defendants were all transferred to the detention center. When Wang Xiuying, one of the defendants, heard that she was sentenced to eight years in prison, she burst into tears and cried out "Mother!" It can be seen that the law is strict. Although she repents and cries now, it is too late. The defendants all whispered that they could only appeal for relief in the hope of a reduced sentence. When they were led down by the bailiffs and returned to the detention center, the defendants all had tears in their eyes and bowed their heads as they entered the detention center.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society has recently received claims from members such as Qiu Shigui and Wu Shan, stating that they were injured by nails and glass shards thrown on the road, and requested assistance. The association has provided medical treatment and food rations to each of them. It has been found that 60% to 70% of these injured rickshaw pullers have family burdens, with elderly parents and young children. Pulling a rickshaw is their only means of livelihood, and their feet are important tools. Now that they are unable to walk, without the relief offered by the association, those waiting to be fed will face starvation. Compatriots, who does not have parents, who does not have children? Compassion is inherent in all people. It is hoped that citizens of this city will pay attention to this in the future and intervene and stop such behavior at any time, benefiting laborers. The merits are immeasurable.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Third Branch of the Citizen Association Discusses Double Taxation of Road Construction Beyond Boundaries; Requests Approval from the General Federation of Citizen Associations <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>In Xiaoshadu and Caojiadu in West Shanghai, electricity, telephone, and tap water on roads constructed beyond the boundaries are supplied by the Public Concession. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Public Works Department charged residents and businesses in that area who used water, electricity, and telephones an extraterritorial municipal tax (i.e., patrol tax), with a tax rate lower than that within the boundaries by 2%. It initially levied 12% and then 14%. Since the city government began levying a municipal general tax (i.e., house tax), the citizens in that area have not paid the city tax because they cannot bear the double taxation and cannot avoid using the water and electricity of the concession. Later, negotiations were held to recover the roads beyond the boundaries, so the matter was put on hold. Recently, the Shanghai West Electricity Company was established, and the city government granted a business license. There is no longer a problem with using electricity. The citizens in that area then raised the issue of paying the concession patrol tax at the general meeting of the third branch of the Citizen Association. Should the payment be stopped at this time, or should the original situation be maintained? After repeated discussions, it was resolved to submit the matter to the General Federation of Citizen Associations for instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Female Teacher Wang Quanquying Threatened; Search for Letter Paper and Handwriting as Evidence; Liang Linzhang Confesses that Ni Guoxiang Initiated It; Police Detective Work is Swift and Appraisal is Required <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Wang Quanquying, a female teacher at Nanjing Jinling University, is from Ningbo, Zhejiang. Her home address is No. 54 Hengde Lane, Hart Road, Shanghai Public Concession. At about 8:00 AM on November 27th, Ms. Wang suddenly found a letter on the floor in the kitchen. It was addressed to the honorable owner of No. 54. Upon inspection, it turned out to be a threatening letter. The signatory was the bandit leader Yao Houhuo, who stated that he had more than a dozen bandits under his command and was now extorting 5,000 yuan from the honorable owner. He asked her to meet him in front of Sincere Company. If she saw someone wearing blue cloth pants, she could contact him. If she did not agree, they would come to rob her or murder her family. He also stated that the representative they sent was carrying a handgun, etc. Ms. Wang reported the letter to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge. Hua Detective Zhu Mengwei, Detective Gao Huixian, He Renrui, and others were assigned to investigate, and they took turns guarding Ms. Wang's home to prevent accidents. On the morning of the 28th, Detective Gao Huixian was waiting at Wang's house when he suddenly heard a slight noise in the kitchen. He went to check and found another letter had been thrown in. Detective Gao quickly went out the back door and saw a man in a suit standing in the nearby lane. There was no one else suspicious. Detective Gao stepped forward and asked him. The man stammered and said his name was Liang Linzhang, from Guangdong, and lived at No. 62 Hengde Lane. The detectives went to No. 62 to check and found that the man did live there. At that time, there was no evidence, so he was not arrested. He reported back to the police station and conducted further investigation. It was discovered that Liang Linzhang was a relative of Mr. Liang, a Cantonese resident of No. 62, and was unemployed. However, he was highly suspected in this case, so he was arrested on the day. With the permission of his relative Mr. Liang, the detectives searched his room and found several sheets of paper (the same as the paper in the letter received by Ms. Wang). He was taken to the police station. Under questioning, he admitted everything and confessed that Ni Guoxiang, a servant of Zhang Yougu (an employee of the Shanghai Electric Power Company located at No. 60 in the lane), was also an accomplice. Chinese and Western detectives then went to arrest Ni and found an ink brush, ink, and a sheet of paper. They were taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court and prosecuted for attempted extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin then rose to state the case, saying that the victim Wang Quanquying had received two letters in total, the first demanding 5,000 yuan and the second reduced to 3,000 yuan. After the two defendants were arrested, Liang Linzhang was asked to write a note in the police station. His handwriting was the same as the letters received by Ms. Wang, and the English date written on the back of the original letter also matched the English written by Liang. Because the handwriting has not yet been appraised by experts, and there is also a resident surnamed Li in Hengde Lane where the plaintiff lives who has also received a threatening letter, he requested that the trial be postponed. Wang Quanquying then filed a complaint, recounting what happened. Under questioning, Liang Linzhang confessed that Ni Guoxiang initiated the matter. Ni's nickname is A-huo, so Yao Houhuo is Ni's alias. Ni drafted the letter and asked me to copy it. If he got 5,000 yuan, I could get 500 yuan. Ni Guoxiang denied everything. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confession and ordered the two defendants to be detained for seven days before the next hearing.</p>

If there is a need to add anything, we will do our best. The club will have Chinese and Western restaurants, dance halls, bowling alleys, billiard rooms, shuttlecock courts, gyms, poker and mahjong rooms, and libraries.

<p>The Yimiao Police Station received an anonymous report from Gu Bingkui the night before, stating that there was a secret organization selling red pills (opium pills) for lamp smoking in No. 2 Zhangjia Lane, Xiaotianzhu Lane, in the city. The lane is small and winding, very secretive, and a detailed diagram was attached. Director Liu, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered the household registration inspector Chen Shusheng to lead the police to rush to the scene. They found the door according to the diagram and went straight up to the upper floor. They saw Yang Zhushi (39 years old, from Shanghai), Yang Xingxing (34 years old, same), and Shao Xuede (47 years old) sleeping on the same bed, smoking opium pills. They were immediately arrested, and three opium pill guns, one opium pipe, one lamp, three bags of opium pills (44 pills), more than ten empty bags of opium pills, one can of opium pill ash, and a small amount of opium paste and ash were found. While searching for other evidence, Yang Zhushi, in order to destroy the evidence, took the opportunity to throw the three opium pill guns out of the window, causing the magnetic heads to break. The evidence was taken to the police station for investigation. After Director Liu questioned him, Yang Zhushi confessed that the opium pills were bought from the entrance of Yinhe Lane in the French Concession. The case is related to the enforced ban on drugs and opium. It is planned to send the case to the general bureau for strict handling.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Barber Teases and Injures Passing Women; Tian Jinrong Fined 100 Yuan <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yang Pangshi, a woman from Nanxiang, named Jinmei, who lives at No. 86 Wenzhou Road, goes out to shop every day. When she passes the Overseas Chinese Barber Shop at No. 352 Avenue Edward VII, the barber in the shop often utters dirty words and teases her. Because she could not reason with them, she did not argue with them. At 9:40 AM the day before yesterday, she was walking with her cousin Wu Xiaomao when Tian Jinrong, the manager of the shop from Yangzhou, and the barber Bai Henglin said that her buttocks were well-developed and lovely, and that she could raise sparrows on her buttocks, and that if she had money, she could buy them. Wu Xiaomao stepped forward to question them, but Tian and others not only did not repent but dragged the siblings into the shop. Tian then used a razor to cut the woman's head. Wu Xiaomao saw this and immediately stopped him with his hand, causing his palm to be injured by the knife. Wu and the woman grabbed Tian and went to the Xinzha Police Station. Hua Detective Yang Youshan investigated and found that it was true and took Tian into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for intentional injury under Article 277, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and requested that he be severely punished according to the law. Yang Pangshi and others then submitted a report on the situation at that time. The defendant confessed that the plaintiff had invited many people to come and cause trouble, that the injury was not caused by him, and that there was no teasing. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the confession and sentenced Tian to a fine of 100 yuan. If he chose to perform labor service instead, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. During the appeal period, he had to submit a guarantee deposit or a guarantee letter of the same amount.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Heavy Exploitation: Tai Feng Pawnshop Accused; Wei Duanmin Files Private Prosecution, Zhang Yongjia Admits Interest <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The current criminal law stipulates that the exploitation of excessive interest is a crime, and ordinary small pawnshops are the first to bear the brunt. In recent months, complaints from those who have pawned items have become commonplace. Now, Tai Feng Pawnshop at 1272 Labor Sheng Road has also been accused of exploiting excessive interest by Wei Duanmin from Yancheng, who has filed a criminal private prosecution with the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan held a court hearing. According to Wei's statement, he was studying at China Public School and needed money on July 23rd. He asked Tang San to pawn an electric fan at the pawnshop for seven yuan. However, the pawn ticket stated seven yuan, seven jiao, and one fen, and the redemption period was shortened from August to April. When he went to redeem the item on the 23rd of this month, he paid a total of eight yuan, three jiao, one fen, and six li for principal and interest. This means that the monthly interest rate was actually as high as four fen and seven li, which is undoubtedly exploitation of excessive interest. Zhang Yongjia, the manager of the accused Tai Feng Pawnshop, stated that the pawn amount paid to Tang San for the electric fan was seven yuan in silver dollars and eight jiao in small coins, plus one jiao for the storage of the pawned item. Therefore, the pawn ticket stated seven yuan, seven jiao, and one fen. Because the electric fan was made of iron and easily damaged, the pawning period was shortened from August to April. All of this was agreed upon face-to-face with the pawner. Later, when the plaintiff came to redeem the item, interest was calculated at two fen per month, so he charged a total of eight yuan, three jiao, one fen, and six li for principal and interest, of which six jiao and eight li were interest. Furthermore, around the 18th or 19th of this month, someone came to the store and said that someone would sue me, but I didn't pay attention to it at first. Unexpectedly, this morning, two people named Liu and Ding came to the store and said that they were familiar with Wei and were willing to mediate, asking me to spend a little money to settle the matter, but I didn't agree. He also submitted the pawnshop's pawned item ledger as evidence. Tang San then testified in court, saying that he only received seven yuan for the pawn, and the money and pawn ticket were handed over to Wei's wife. Wei continued to say that he was ill that day and only knew the amount on the pawn ticket was different from the actual amount paid by the pawnshop when he went to redeem the item. Judge Wu then adjourned the hearing to December 7th in the afternoon for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Transfer of Yang Peter Issue: Temporary Detention During Appeal Period <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yang Peter, a native of Xinhui and an employee of the Hong Kong branch of the Guangdong Bank, embezzled more than 198,000 yuan in August of the year before last and fled to Shanghai, hiding with his concubine Wang Baoqiong in the Delin Apartment on Chongming Road. Recently, the bank found out about it, telegraphed the Hongkou Police Station, sent detectives to arrest him, and handed him over to the First Special District Court for detention pending investigation, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that after Yang was arrested, the branch reported to the head office, which in turn asked the Guangdong Provincial Government to telegraph the Shanghai Municipal Government to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau for extradition. Mayor Wu ordered Cai, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to send a letter and specially assign detectives to submit it to the First Special Court yesterday morning, requesting permission to transfer the suspect to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for detention, so that the Guangdong provincial authorities could come to escort him. Judge Xiao Xiechen held a court hearing and ordered Yang to be brought up for questioning. Yang's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, argued that the Guangdong Provincial Government telegraphed the Municipal Government to request negotiations with the Public Works Bureau, but Director Cai of the Public Security Bureau requested the transfer from the court, which is inconsistent with the procedure. First, the Public Security Bureau is also detaining him while waiting for Guangdong to escort him, which is no different from detaining him in the court while waiting for Guangdong to come. Second, since Guangdong wants to transfer him, why not have the local court prepare a document to request the transfer, but now it is being handled by a non-judicial organization. Third, therefore, he still requests that Yang be detained and proceed according to law. However, the representative of the Public Security Bureau stated in court that the transfer procedures were complete. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, also stated that the Public Works Bureau had no opinion on the transfer and asked the court to handle it. Judge Xiao then ordered Yang Peter to be taken away by the personnel from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Lawyer Jiang Yiping immediately declared an appeal on behalf of Yang, requesting that the transfer not be carried out during the appeal period, and cited the precedent of the Third Branch of the High Court revoking the Second Special Court's approval of the transfer by non-judicial organs in the mainland, arguing for a long time. Judge Xiao then replied, "Temporary detention during the appeal period." Thus, Yang Peter was still taken back to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>Letter Received:</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>We have just received a telegram from the captain of our company's Changxing ship stating, "The Shen Bao newspaper on the 29th reported that our ship ran aground and the engine room flooded. Where did this news come from? We are deeply shocked and hope you will send a letter to correct it, to avoid misunderstandings among passengers' families and cargo owners."</p>
<p>After investigation, we have found that your newspaper did indeed publish such a report on the 29th, which is indeed misleading. Furthermore, the ship safely escaped danger last night during the high tide and is sailing as usual, without any damage to the hull. Grounding during periods of low water is a common occurrence. We are writing to urgently request that you investigate and correct the report to rectify the facts and avoid misunderstandings. We would be most grateful for your public service.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>National Football Association:</p>
<p>Explains Important Questions Regarding Rules</p>
<p>Published by the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation</p>
<p>The Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation has received a copy of the minutes from the meeting of the International Football Association Rules and Referees Committee held in Paris on October 5th. The minutes contain several examples of questions and answers regarding the interpretation of the rules. We are now publishing these for adoption by the football community.</p>
<p>(1) Interpretation of Rules</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Free Kicks</p>
<p>(Question) A player takes a free kick under Chapter 10, and before the ball is touched by another player, that player (i.e., the kicker) commits a handball. If a player commits two violations, how should the referee rule?</p>
<p>(Answer) The referee should choose the more serious of the two violations and penalize it.</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Restarting After a Temporary Suspension</p>
<p>(Question) When the referee drops the ball, and before the ball touches the ground, a player commits a handball. How should the referee rule?</p>
<p>(Answer) The referee should award a free kick for the handball.</p>
<p>The committee suggests that referees should only apply the above two decisions when the player's violation is very obvious.</p>
<p>(2) The Authority of the Referee and its Relation to the Start of the Match</p>
<p>The committee reaffirms the 1932 resolution that the referee's authority in the field of play, as stipulated by regulations, should begin after the whistle is blown. If a player violates the rules after the whistle is blown, they can be ordered off the field and not replaced. However, to prevent practical difficulties, national football associations should grant referees sufficient administrative authority to determine that the referee's authority begins before the match starts.</p>
<p>(3) Questions Regarding Rules</p>
<p>(Question) Attacking player A advances into the opponent's penalty area and attempts to pass the ball to the center, but the ball crosses the goal line while remaining in play. At that moment, defending player B, standing on the goal line, commits a violation of Rule 9 against player A. How should the referee rule?</p>
<p>(Answer) The referee should award a penalty kick.</p>
<p>(Question) Suppose someone in the audience blows a whistle, causing the match to stop suddenly. How should the referee handle this?</p>
<p>(Answer) The referee can be lenient in such situations, as players stopping upon hearing a whistle is a sign of good sportsmanship and obedience. The match should be restarted with a dropped ball.</p>
<p>Czech Davis Cup Player</p>
<p>Meng Ruier to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>Performance at the China Tennis Club at 1:30 PM. Tickets: $1 or $2. If it rains, moved to the Shen Yuan Basketball Court.</p>
<p>Czech Davis Cup players Meng Ruier and Ha Tuo are currently touring the Far East. They have performed matches in Japan with Japanese Davis Cup players Yamagishi and Fujikura, which were well-received. The competition has now concluded, and they will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow aboard the Japanese ship Qing Guo Maru. They will then play against Carson and De Fu at the China Tennis Club at 5 Singapore Road. Ticket prices are $1 and $2. If it rains, the event will be moved to Shen Yuan on Jiaozhou Road at 9:00 PM, with tickets priced at $2. Unfortunately, prominent Chinese tennis players from Shanghai, such as Wang Wenzheng, Lin Baohua, and Qiu Feihai, have left Shanghai and will be unable to participate, which is a pity. Meng Ruier is a world-renowned tennis player. In this year's Davis Cup, he defeated Nishimura of Japan in straight sets in the first round and eliminated Fil Fagawu of the Philippines 3-1 in the second round. In the European finals, he defeated Henkel of Germany 3-2. He was only defeated 3-2 by Kweim, ranked second in the world, in the final, and also won two sets against Pan Lai. His strength is evident. Since returning to Shanghai from the United States, Carson's tennis skills have improved rapidly. He has won both the grass and hard court championships in this city. A clash between these two strong players tomorrow is sure to be exciting. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Singles: Meng Ruier vs. Carson, 1:30 PM</p>
<p>Doubles: Meng Ruier/Ha Tuo vs. De Fu, 3:00 PM</p>

<p>Inspector Zhong of the Ministry of Education Inspects Zhejiang Province Vocational Education Report (5):</p>
<p>18. Private Guanghua Junior High School Commerce Program and Private Sanyu Junior Commercial School:</p>
<p>The private Guanghua Junior High School Commerce Program has three classes with over 80 students. In order to provide practical training and career opportunities for the first graduating class next year, the school is in contact with various banks and financial institutions in Hangzhou in the hopes of securing service opportunities for some of its students. The school's on-site training facilities are adequate, typing is good, but banking and commerce facilities are poor. To accommodate the demands of a small number of students' parents, the school offers preparatory courses for higher education from the second year onwards, while exempting students from the core commerce subjects. This approach is not appropriate. Such supplementary classes should only be conducted outside of regular class hours. The school's advertising efforts are noteworthy, but the results are ordinary. The private Sanyu Junior Commercial School has three junior classes and three vocational training classes, with a total of 110 students. The curriculum distribution is appropriate. Banking practice consists of only five or six visits to local banks upon graduation. The store has a basic structure, but there is too little business and no opportunity for practice. Most students choose to pursue higher education, with fewer entering the workforce directly. The typing training program is well-managed. The school's geography and English teaching methods and materials are inadequate. The school has a noticeable Christian atmosphere. The faculty in each department needs improvement. The school should offer more vocational training classes and reduce the number of junior commerce classes to better reflect the actual needs.</p>
<p>19. Private Commercial Society Commercial Training School:</p>
<p>The school offers two departments: general and specialized. The general department offers 12 hours of instruction per week, while the specialized department focuses on electives. It offers four specializations: accounting, banking, English, and Japanese. Each student must choose two specializations, with each specialization meeting for three to four hours per week. Most students are employees of banks, money shops, and stores. Their classroom performance is good. The curriculum distribution is appropriate. Most of the teachers are also instructors at commercial vocational schools. (End)</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>They were very happy that afternoon, although there were quite a few mishaps, which are common in such long journeys! Of course, Tommo caused trouble again. He fell on a hornet's nest and was stung fiercely by them, but he was used to such hardships and was able to endure them until Nan suggested using some wet mud, which reduced his pain considerably. Daisy saw a snake and immediately ran away, spilling half of her wild strawberries. Later, Demi helped her refill her basket, while discussing reptiles with his vast knowledge. Nat fell out of a tree, tearing the back of his vest completely, but fortunately there were no other tears. As and Jack were arguing over a particularly lush spot, just as they reached a stalemate, Tommy quietly and quickly swept everything away, hurrying to Dan's side for protection. At that time, Dan was also very happy, his crutches had been discarded, and he was wandering freely in the prairie, very comfortable, unaware that there was so much strength in his legs. He saw interesting rocks and roots scattered across the prairie, many familiar small animals crawling in the grass, and many insects dancing in the air.</p>
<p>But the most thrilling thing that afternoon was what happened to Nan and Rob. This event later became a family anecdote that was often talked about at the Plumfield, and was still talked about with great interest after a long time. Nan had explored the area, tearing her coat in three places and scratching her face on a thorn bush, and then began picking strawberries, which were bright, shiny, and black, like large beads, on the low green bushes. Her nimble fingers were flying over them, but her basket was not easily filled, so she searched east and west for better places, unlike Daisy, who was content to pick quietly. Rob followed Nan, because her vigorous spirit suited his temperament better than his cousin's patient work, and he was also eager to pick the biggest and best strawberries for "Marmee".</p>
<h3 id="e132">Ministry of Education Approves Imprint of Three Principles of the People Thousand Character Primer <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education's A, B, and C types of Thousand Character Primers have been widely adopted by various provinces and cities. Recently, the Education Bureaus of Jiangyin, Nanhui, Xiaoxian, Yixing, Jiading, and Chuansha counties in Jiangsu Province requested the Shanghai Beixin Bookstore to imprint hundreds of thousands of copies of the C type primer. This has been submitted by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education to the Ministry of Education for approval. According to the person in charge of the relevant department of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry has always welcomed the imprint of this primer by all sectors. In addition to having samples available for reference, there are also measures for imprinting the Three Principles of the People Thousand Character Primer, which were announced in March of the 20th year and published in the 11th issue of the 3rd volume of the Ministry's gazette and the compilation of educational laws. Anyone wishing to imprint the primer only needs to submit a sample to the Ministry for approval in accordance with these measures, and they can then be printed and sold. There is no exclusive sale by anyone, and the Ministry has never approved any individual or bookstore to have exclusive sales rights. Recently, the Datong Bookstore suddenly published an advertisement in the Shanghai Xin Shen newspapers regarding the imprint and sale of the Three Principles of the People Thousand Character Primer. The Ministry considered this to be close to a monopoly and has strictly prohibited it. Before printing, the sample must be submitted to the Ministry for approval, which is done to prevent shoddy printing, errors, and excessively high prices.</p>

He fell on a hornet's nest and was stung fiercely by them, but he was used to such hardships and was able to endure them until Nan suggested using some wet mud, which reduced his pain considerably. Daisy saw a snake and immediately ran away, spilling half of her wild strawberries. Later, Demi helped her refill her basket, while discussing reptiles with his vast knowledge. Nat fell out of a tree, tearing the back of his vest completely, but fortunately there were no other tears. As and Jack were arguing over a particularly lush spot, just as they reached a stalemate, Tommy quietly and quickly swept everything away, hurrying to Dan's side for protection. At that time, Dan was also very happy, his crutches had been discarded, and he was wandering freely in the prairie, very comfortable, unaware that there was so much strength in his legs. He saw interesting rocks and roots scattered across the prairie, many familiar small animals crawling in the grass, and many insects dancing in the air.</p>
<p>But the most thrilling thing that afternoon was what happened to Nan and Rob. This event later became a family anecdote that was often talked about at the Plumfield, and was still talked about with great interest after a long time. Nan had explored the area, tearing her coat in three places and scratching her face on a thorn bush, and then began picking strawberries, which were bright, shiny, and black, like large beads, on the low green bushes. Her nimble fingers were flying over them, but her basket was not easily filled, so she searched east and west for better places, unlike Daisy, who was content to pick quietly. Rob followed Nan, because her vigorous spirit suited his temperament better than his cousin's patient work, and he was also eager to pick the biggest and best strawberries for "Marmee".</p>

<p>The China Social Education Society is the only social education academic organization in our country. Its annual meetings have made great contributions to social education academics in our country. The society's fourth annual meeting was originally scheduled to be held at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou starting on January 21st of next year. Recently, a telegram was received from the Guangzhou Preparatory Committee stating that, as the time coincides with the Lunar New Year, according to Southern customs, all businesses and printing workers will be closed as usual. This would cause inconvenience for the progress of the annual meeting and for the travel of society members. Therefore, it was decided to advance the meeting by three days, holding it from January 18th to 22nd. The society has already issued an urgent notice to all society members attending the meeting. Furthermore, National Sun Yat-sen University believes that the society's annual meeting in Guangzhou will definitely provide much guidance for social education in South China. Therefore, it is providing a subsidy of 4,000 national currency for society members to attend. The deadline for society members to register for attendance has now passed. In addition to the Guangzhou society members, a total of 254 people have registered. Social education experts Liang Shuming, Jiang Jianyu, Gao Jiansi, Meng Xiancheng, Jin Lingxiu, Zhao Buxia, Yu Qingtang, Li Zheng, and Chen Jianzhao will all attend on schedule. Zhang Jiong, Director of the Social Education Department of the Ministry of Education, has also notified the society that he has decided to attend. Recently, Xiao Guanying, Cui Zaiyang, and other members of the society's annual meeting preparatory committee have been actively preparing, sparing no effort, it is said.</p>

<p>The gold market was initially weak yesterday before exhibiting hidden strength. Major players had differing demands for supply, while retail investors initially exited before re-entering. Favorable rumors spread, and the swap premium actually fell to 7.5 yuan, which boosted confidence. The result was a rebound, and the situation also turned stable. In the early morning, overseas silver markets in both England and the United States were flat. The forward silver price in Montreal fell by 0.5 hao and rose by 0.2 li respectively. Exchange rates slightly narrowed. The price of raw gold in London rose by 1.5 pence. The Central Bank's standard gold bullion price was announced, with both English and American prices flat. The customs gold unit remained unchanged. The listed price of standard gold bullion rose to 1146.9 yuan. People's sentiment stabilized. Off-market provisional trading opened at around 43 yuan. Fuxing, Yonghui, and Xiang made progressive additions, trending upwards. However, due to Hengchang and Yongshang selling and then covering, the morning opening was slightly higher, and it continued to rise after opening. However, because major players took advantage of the high prices to sell, and short sellers also increased their positions, prices gradually declined. Retail investors took the opportunity to sell and turned weak. The HSBC's listed price was announced, with English prices flat and American prices narrowing by 0.0625. Although there was a slight struggle in the middle, prices still fell to 40.06 yuan at one point. However, buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain them, gradually pulling them up. Since the silver balance tax was announced as unchanged, the situation turned stable, and there was more buying. Later, the foreign firms still had settlement funds, and major players purchased. After that, the market lacked supply and gradually prospered. Although predictions for Indian silver were one anna higher, the speculation could not wait and rushed to cover. As a result, the buying spree suddenly intensified. At noon, the situation became stable. This was the reaction that was expected after the increase in capital and the reduction of residual positions. However, the trend did not deviate from mediocrity. The future will depend on whether the major players revive their spirits and whether there are stimulating messages from the outside world. The swap premium yesterday was only 7.5 yuan for short sellers. The capital for the January period has increased to more than 12,800 units. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>

Yifengyong, Yicheng, and Fuyu took advantage of the low prices to add, rebounding to 2.4 yuan. Dadecheng and Hengyu still sold at high prices, falling back to 1.6 yuan. The announcement of the silver balance tax did not offer any encouragement. The situation was stable, and the foreign firms still had settlement funds. Dafayong and Yuanmaoyong increased to 2.7 yuan. Fuyu and Dadecheng withdrew, falling to 1.4 yuan. Jinfengyong, Dadecheng, Yicheng, Qianyuan Yong, and retail investors all bought, gradually rising to 3 yuan.

The customs gold unit also did not change. The opening was still flat. The HSBC's listed prices announced that English was flat and American narrowed by 0.0625. This had no major impact. However, because banks slightly sold off, the sentiment of Chinese merchants was depressed. At this time, it tended to harden slightly. The silver balance tax was announced as unchanged, and people's sentiment had turned calm. Foreign firms made some settlements, which allowed for maintenance. Later, due to repeated settlements by banks, it gradually became tighter. British American Tobacco came to settle the current shillings. Although the Indian silver forecast rose one anna, the domestic market was sufficient to supply. Therefore, the process became tight. At noon closing, the near-term selling price of the English exchange rate was 1 shilling and 2.5 pence. The American exchange rate was 29.8125 yuan, which was tighter by 0.0625 for the English exchange rate and 0.125 for the American exchange rate compared to the previous close.

<h3 id="e145">Securities: Longs Lack Strength to Push Up; Government Bonds Rebound and Fall Sharply <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw a sudden shift to a declining trend. Major players and gold firms emerged, and the manipulators of the long positions have already been exposed. All previous rumors were just air. People's morale has been scattered, and it will be difficult to recover temporarily. Although there is still a small amount of support, such as the buying by number 46, it seems to be on a shift basis. But because of its limited strength, it is often succumbed to high pressure, such as the selling by number 35, the quantity of which makes it impossible for number 46 to bear. Because the North China incident is becoming more serious, and the long side also has signs of inconsistency, the strength to push up is naturally weak. Currently, they may abandon their inherent advocacy. The continuous outflow of spot goods in the market and the transfer to foreign currency have especially shocked the long side. Cracks have appeared in the long side's prospects. If they do not push up, there is a risk of a sharp fall. Yesterday, only three trades were made. At the opening, numbers 4 and 77 were jointly selling, and numbers 20, 35, and 54 were mostly long sides selling. Although numbers 43 and 46 still bought, they felt unable to support it. Among them, the selling of gold firms by number 35 was the most fierce and huge. Number 46 was often suppressed, and the market price fell back uniformly by several jiao to 1.75 yuan. In the second trade, the selling trend was still strong. Numbers 4, 16, 35, 43, and 54 were the most enthusiastic. Numbers 46 and 75 bravely raised prices, but the pressure was still too heavy, and they still could not struggle. It continued to fall slightly by 0.35 jiao to 0.67 jiao. Closing trading was less, and the market atmosphere was still sluggish. Most continued to weaken by 0.12 jiao to 0.4 jiao. Finally, at the end, numbers 6 and 46 took advantage of the small amount of trading to strive to push up, rebounding by 0.3 jiao. Number 96's rally was particularly profitable, also good for 0.2 jiao. Because the long side's battle line was shaken and the environment was unfavorable, it is difficult to expect optimism in the future unless reinforcements are added. As a result, the market price uniformly fell back by several jiao to 2.1 yuan. The total number of transactions was 26,815,000 yuan. The results of its gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that yesterday (29th), the New York stock market fell, but only aviation stocks surged, which is difficult to explain. President Roosevelt claimed that the peak of government spending has passed, which traders were pleased to hear. However, the European situation is serious, so prices continued to fall. By closing, stocks on the small exchange also fell, and the bond market fluctuated. The total volume of trading for the day was 2,178,000 shares.

<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation feels stable. Because the situation in the north has eased, people's morale in the market has been greatly stabilized. However, some colleagues have the idea of selling short because the market has reached a high level. However, because of some problems, the banking sector firmly refuses to release the amounts. However, the distance between the near and far-term battle lines is inevitably too far. This situation may be beneficial to short sellers, but it is also necessary to take into account the thin inventory of yarn and the high price of raw cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Tagged Yarn Feels Weak in the Far Term <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The tag yarn market saw a slight increase in the opening prices of the various months in the previous market. But when it came to the far month, it was weak. In the second and third rounds, it was heard that government bonds had fallen, and people's morale suddenly weakened. The market price turned downwards. But the new sellers in the arena were not very enthusiastic. Only the near month was harder and the far month was weaker. As a result, the near month rose by 0.145 over the closing price of the previous day, and the far month fell by 0.23. After the afternoon opening, the market lacked sellers. In addition to the Osaka Grade 3 yarn rising by 2 yuan, it continued to rise in the second and third rounds. As a result, each month rose by 0.3469 jiao to 1.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The sales were Hengyi 600 bales, Daji 650 bales, Gengfeng 1050 bales, Sentai 1200 bales, Changyu 350 bales, Shenji 1950 bales, Dachangcheng 400 bales, and Xincheng 850 bales.

<p>The cotton market is quite firm recently, and the upward trend is strong. Foreign firms are absorbing and not releasing, and their intention to hoard is very strong. Dongmian Foreign Firm's export transactions are becoming more active. As a result, people's morale has been revived, and the market is trending upwards. However, the far month is flat. In fact, the difference between near and far terms is too far.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Near-Term Cotton is Extraordinarily Outstanding <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The tag cotton market saw an extraordinarily outstanding situation in the near month at the opening of the pre-market. Because the spot cotton fire engine cotton merchants purchased on the previous day, the market price rose by 0.75 jiao. Therefore, people are optimistic. However, the far month is flat and weak, and Indian cotton has fallen by 3 rupees. American cotton is also gloomy. As a result, the near month rose by 0.1 jiao to 0.35 jiao over the closing price of the previous day, and the far month was flat. After the afternoon opening, the market suddenly tightened, and buyers increased. Because the spot cotton situation is good, the near month is becoming more expensive. As a result, the near month continued to rise by 0.23 jiao compared to the morning closing price, and the far month rose by 0.1 jiao. The sales were Dafeng 2400 dan, Meifei 1300 dan, Gengfeng 3400 dan, Senkang 1700 dan, Yuanyi 4700 dan, Dachangcheng 1300 dan, Runkang 1100 dan, Hengchang 1000 dan, Tongfeng 1600 dan, Changfeng 3600 dan, and Yuanxingchang 1100 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a weak market, with declines of 4 to 7 points in various months. Unfavorable news came from Liverpool, Egypt, India, etc. Foreign merchants sold off, long positions were liquidated, and cotton farmers sold short. Except for limited price purchases on dips, there was a lack of new buyers. Industry insiders believe the European situation is unpredictable, and sentiment is uncertain. The stock market was initially sluggish, but the wheat market was strong. Hester estimates factory use for this week at 276,000 bales, and Liverpool inventory at 227,000 bales. The market now needs calm. The close was stable, with spot prices down 5 points and futures down 3 to 7 points. English cotton spot prices fell 7 points, and futures rose 1 point. Indian cotton saw retail buying, long position liquidation, and selling by futures traders. Japanese traders slightly entered Pingguor. Pingguor fell 1.75 to 2 rupees, Aomura fell 2.5 to 3 rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell 3.25 rupees. The original telegram is on the left. (Telegram of the 29th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, Hakka xian rice continued to arrive in large quantities. Shipments from the Yangtze River were continuous, and shipments from Fujian and Zhejiang also arrived one after another. Northern merchants were still reluctant to ship due to the unstable situation. The market seemed to be continuing its downward trend. However, the lag in prices in the shipping market to Japan triggered activity among outside hoarders. More than 2,000 bags were bought yesterday. With the activity of hoarders, the market appetite slightly improved, and the sluggishness immediately stabilized. A total of 2,300 bags of Gan rice, 168 bags of Xiang rice, 130 bags of Shashi rice, 500 bags of Nanling rice, 200 bags of Anqing rice, 1,350 bags of Zhejiang rice, 300 bags of Min rice, and 400 bags of Saigon Siam rice were opened for sale throughout the day.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Large Arrival of Bo Rice Causes Further Decline <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources for various brokers were even stronger, with a total of more than 60 brokers arriving (with a total of more than 13,000 shi), mainly consisting of bo rice. Therefore, although there were continuous purchases of more than 4,000 bags of bo rice by brokers from Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, the market situation for bo rice ultimately declined further by 2 to 3 jiao due to the large influx of goods. Although the appetites for thick early rice and other japonica rice were sluggish due to the rainy weather, fortunately the arrivals were sparse, allowing for some recovery. Due to the large supply of Duyangjian and Dujian rice, the prices were weak, and high-quality Yinyuan rice was scarce, fetching good prices. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 36 to 37 shipments from various routes along the river. Due to the continuous rain, the appetites for various goods in the market were weak, and the shops were sparsely attended. Although a few opened for business, there were no sales. The market price for high-quality white japonica rice was slightly weak, while mid-range rice remained stable. Yangjian rice rose by a few jiao, while the prices of other goods remained similar to before.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Flour and Wheat Deliveries are Still Acceptable <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for November flour. The total amount delivered throughout the day was 88,000 bags, of which the new delivery orders from Xinda Factory accounted for 55,000 bags, and the rest were return shipments for hedging. The inventory of other factories was still abundant, but they had all been withdrawn by out-of-town brokers in advance, or had been used for hedging, so there were no actual deliveries. Since December is the end of the fiscal year, deliveries are usually brought forward. It is said that the Exchange has announced that trading this month will be suspended on December 27th, and normal trading will resume on January 3rd of next year.</p>
<p>The total number of wheat deliveries was 39 cars, with 4 cars delivered by the 10th, 1 car by the 18th, 4 cars by the 19th, 8 cars by the 23rd, 1 car by the 25th, 16 cars by the 36th, 4 cars by the 38th, and 1 car by the 42nd. On the receiving side, 14 cars were received by the 16th, 5 cars by the 24th, 8 cars by the 26th, and 12 cars by the 35th. There were no formal deliveries of soybean cake or soybean oil. As for foreign zhi sesame, 50 tons were delivered, with 25 tons delivered by the 27th by the 35th and 38th, respectively.</p>
<p>Regarding overseas wheat, it is said that a major short seller has already covered his positions. Black disease has been discovered in Argentine wheat, the factory market is slightly tight, and the serious situation in Europe has a stabilizing effect on wheat. However, foreign demand remains weak.</p>

<p>The output of orchid bamboo branches produced in Zhangzhou this year is inherently small. Previously, due to sluggish sales in Shanghai, most of the goods here were diverted to Wenzhou for sale, resulting in extremely thin inventories and few stocks on hand. Lately, there have been no new arrivals, and with active sales in Zhejiang, there is a sudden feeling of supply not meeting demand, and a great sense of shortage. Yesterday, the market price had already rebounded by 2-3 yuan, and the market trend was brisk.</p>

<p>Due to the lack of sales in Shanghai and by out-of-town brokers, cottonseed refined oil has long been in a weak market. However, crude oil, which few people pay attention to, has seen a sudden surge in overseas sales markets this week. Various oil pressing factories in Shanghai have been selling off, with a large volume of up to 300 tons traded. The price was uniformly 17 yuan, stipulated to be per 100 jin on the Sima scale, with taxes and fees to be added. Jardine Matheson, Jardine Engineering Corporation, and Bao Long Foreign Firm, among others, were buying for delivery in December and January. The market prices they set were all based on verbal agreements, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market situation remained lackluster. Sales of high-grade Zhenmei from Wuyuan and Tunxi, among other places, have not yet started. Stocks of Gongxi and Gongzhu teas, as well as Baitu Zhuang, are also taking a wait-and-see approach. However, the Moroccan market still has sparse sales of needle and xiuxian teas. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, China Yongxing, and other firms continued to buy in more than 200 boxes, with no change in selling prices.</p>

<p>New long-pile silk woven camel down is particularly popular this year because long coats for men and women are extremely fashionable, and most people with some assets are having them made. Because, apart from clothing shops that process the goods, the wool merchants on Qipan Street do not make custom orders, there are not many arrivals, and supply cannot meet demand. Top-grade goods are mostly sold for 22-23 yuan, and second-grade goods are sold for 15-16 yuan. Inventories are still scarce, and the market sentiment is more favorable than that of top-grade goods. Most of those who have inventory are unwilling to compromise, and both wholesale and retail sales must be paid in cash, which is truly rare recently. Upon investigation, this type of new long-pile camel down men's and women's coats actually cannot keep out the cold. As soon as they encounter rain or snow, the pile is ruined. Therefore, it is only welcomed by the propertied class in this corner of the sea who emphasize fashion and boast of beauty. There is no other way out, so it is predicted that its time in the limelight will not last long.</p>

<p>Transactions in Dongbai iron have been very sluggish recently. Because out-of-town brokers have stopped buying, and factory sales are also sluggish, the market situation is very weak. Therefore, the industry is hesitant to place orders with Osaka, and there has been no news of transactions for a month. However, a telegram arrived from Osaka yesterday stating that the price of 3' x 7' Dongbai iron has fallen from 1 yuan (Japanese yen) to 88 fen (Japanese yen) per sheet. It is said that the local industry has not placed orders due to lack of profit. It is expected that the market will inevitably see further declines.</p>

<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>People say: "Save the middle school students." I say: We should even more "Save the Children"!</p>
<p>Look at the adults in China. They are either timid as mice or accustomed to complacency, not striving for improvement. Westerners like to explore, like to fly into the stratosphere in hot air balloons, but in China, we don't hear about this kind of scientific exploration. If there is any, they are just acting as guides or assistants for Westerners in places like Tibet. How did things get to this point? My answer is: as children, they were made timid by parents who didn't understand educational principles.</p>
<p>This fact hasn't changed even now, that parents (mostly mothers), in order to coax small children to sleep, always say: "Listen! The jackal is coming, the tiger is coming, good baby. Go to sleep quickly!" At the same time, parents or other people imitate the roar of a wolf or tiger in the dark. "Once frightened, the child falls asleep," especially when the child is crying, this method is used the most.</p>
<p>Once or twice is not a big deal, but over time, it will have a serious impact on the child's psychology. In tangible terms: adults' fear of walking at night, fear of entering remote mountains, that kind of wary and cowardly attitude, was undoubtedly nurtured when they were children. In intangible terms: the whole nation's hesitancy, lack of a firm fighting stance, is probably related to childhood education, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now that the National Children's Year Binxie Committee has just opened, I would like to raise this subtle but also quite important issue to urge educators and parents to pay attention.</p>

<p>Little friends: Do you like to know more stories about clever children in history, like Sima Guang smashing the jar to save the drowning child, and Wen Yanbo filling the jar with water to retrieve the ball? Here, let me introduce a few more.</p>
<p>During the Later Han Dynasty, Huang Wan's grandfather, named Qiong, was the prefect of Wei Commandery. One year, during a solar eclipse, the Empress Dowager asked Huang Qiong: "How much was eclipsed?" Huang Qiong didn't know the shape of the solar eclipse, so he couldn't answer for a moment. Huang Wan was only seven years old at the time, but he said to Huang Qiong: "Just say that the remaining sun is almost the same as the crescent moon, and that will be correct." Huang Qiong followed his words and reported it, and the Empress Dowager praised him greatly.</p>
<p>Yang Xiu was only nine years old when Kong Rong visited his home. His father brought out bayberries, and Kong Rong said to him, "These are your family's fruits." He replied to Kong Rong, "I haven't heard that peacocks are your family's birds."</p>
<p>Xu Xuan, the prime minister of the Southern Tang Dynasty's Li Houzhu, was already able to write articles when he was ten years old. One day, he was writing a poem about the sounds of autumn, and he finished it in no time. Li He and Pei Jing of the Tang Dynasty were also able to write articles at the age of seven.</p>
<p>During the Jin Dynasty, Wang Rong, at the age of six or seven, was playing games with children by the roadside. He saw that the plums on the plum tree bore a lot of fruit, and the children all went to pick and eat them, but Wang Rong didn't pick them alone. Someone asked him, "Why don't you like to pick and eat them?" He said, "The tree bears so much fruit by the roadside, they must be bitter plums." The children who picked the plums tasted them and found that they were indeed bitter.</p>
<p>During the Han Dynasty, Zhang Tang's father was the administrator of Chang'an when Zhang Tang was young. One day, his father went out and told Zhang Tang to guard the house. A piece of meat was stolen by a rat, and his father suspected that he had eaten it, so he beat him. Later, he dug the hole, caught the rat, and found the remaining meat stolen by the rat. He then sat in court alone and sentenced the rat as a prisoner. All the arrangements were very much like an old official.</p>

<p>One morning, Xiao Ming was sitting alone at the table eating breakfast. On the table were jellyfish, fried dough sticks, meat floss, etc. He thought the jellyfish tasted good and was crispy, but he didn't understand what it was. After finishing his porridge, he went to ask his older brother, Xiao Cong: "Brother Cong, what is the name of the side dish in the small bowl that I ate with my porridge just now?" Xiao Cong thought for a moment and said: "Oh, that's called jellyfish. It's produced in the southeastern coastal areas of our country. It can be divided into two parts, the upper part is a flat, round, and wide fleshy film, the color is white, the surface is very smooth, and the center is raised into an umbrella shape. The texture is loose and crispy. This is called the umbrella part. The lower part is called the stalk, which is thick and long, and has two-sided forked flesh. The jellyfish you ate for breakfast was its skin, called jellyfish skin. There are many other kinds of things produced in the sea. Now I'll tell you about a few:</p>
<p>1.  Stonehead Fish: Also called yellow croaker, because its head is as hard as a stone, so it is called stonehead. Its teeth are sharp, thin, and hard, its mouth is in front of its head, and it has a swim bladder in its belly. The bladder can expand and contract. When it contracts, the body sinks; when it expands, the body floats. Its fins are slightly similar to those of carp, but its tail fin is not forked, like a circle. It has an anal fin, pectoral fin, pelvic fin, dorsal fin, and caudal fin. The anal fin and dorsal fin keep the body stable, the pectoral fin and pelvic fin are used for paddling forward, and the caudal fin is of course used for turning. Its meat is very delicious and can be dried.</p>
<p>2.  Sea Cucumber: Its body is similar to a cylinder, and the flesh is soft and thick. Its mouth is at the front of its body, and its back has many uneven nodules. Its meat can also be eaten, and it has many small pieces around its mouth, called tentacles, which are used for predation. It can also be dried and sold to various places. In the hot pot we eat during the New Year, there is a dark brown thing, which is dried sea cucumber.</p>
<p>3.  Coral: It lives in warm seas and its body is constantly swaying. When it encounters aquatic animals that are smaller than it, it uses the eight pairs of small tentacles around its mouth to prey on them. Its structure is extremely simple, with only one sac, which is its body cavity and gastrointestinal tract, so it is called a coelenterate. What we usually see is a coral tree, which is the skeleton of coral polyps. It can be made into various rings, buttons, hairpins, etc. as decorations, which are very beautiful. There are red, white, and agate colors, and the price is not expensive, and the production is also very high.</p>

<p>— Cheng Ming</p>
<p>Winter has arrived, the north wind roars like a tiger's howl, the weather is terribly cold. I wear a cotton robe on my body, and wool gloves on my hands. I wear an aviator hat on my head, and the children's happiness is truly like this.</p>
<p>Winter has arrived, I get up early in the morning and eat my fill, I carry my schoolbag to school. The teacher teaches us to do morning exercises, to strengthen our bodies and spirits, and the cold air is completely dispelled by the exercises.</p>
<p>Winter has arrived, the disaster area refugees are miserable, they have no clothes to wear, and no food to eat. Hunger and cold are intertwined, and their lives cannot be protected. I advise the children to save on sweets and miscellaneous expenses to help these suffering compatriots.</p>

<p>— Liu Guoying, 6th Grade, West Xia Elementary School</p>
<p>Min'er is a child from a farming family. His family was originally a very happy family, and his parents loved him very much. But when he was nine years old, his mother died. Since his mother died, he has felt very unhappy and often sad and tearful. Soon his father married a stepmother, who was very hateful. One day, when his father was out, his stepmother often beat or scolded him, and often asked him to do difficult things. Min'er was very young, so he didn't know how to do them, so his stepmother beat him severely. He thought of his own mother's love, so he went to his mother's grave and cried for a long time. When he returned home, it was already late. His stepmother beat him so badly that his skin was broken and he couldn't move. Later, a very loyal old servant carried him to bed and asked a doctor to treat him. Although his injuries were healed, he was treated like a slave by his stepmother every day. When his father returned, he learned of these things and drove his stepmother out. From then on, his father never remarried.</p>

<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Going to a familiar bathhouse to bathe, I felt something was different.</p>
<p>Looking closely, ah! Everything was as usual, there was no change. However, the clerk who greeted the guests had changed from an adult to a child.</p>
<p>I was very curious and also very heartbroken! So, after bathing, I started talking to a little clerk.</p>
<p>He said: "I am only fifteen years old this year. I am from Yangzhou. When I was young, I studied for three or four years, but later because of family difficulties, I stopped studying. I helped my parents farm in the fields, but it is difficult to farm in the countryside now! The harvest is not good, so they introduced me to do this kind of work. I have only been in Shanghai for a short time, only half a month!" After speaking, he ran off to greet other guests, making tea, wringing towels, massaging feet... and so on.</p>
<p>After hearing the little clerk's words, I couldn't help but remain silent for a long time. I thought: Isn't this year Children's Year? The mission of Children's Year is to seek happiness for general children. Now, where is the happiness of children? Children who should be educated, but have not had the opportunity to be educated, is this the happiness of children? For such a child to be able to scrape together a living in a bathhouse is considered great luck. But there are still hundreds of thousands of children wandering the streets, suffering from hunger and cold, with no fixed place to live. What a serious problem this is!</p>
<p>Save the children? Pay attention to the happiness of children, gentlemen!</p>

<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Little friends, have you seen oil on the surface of water? Oil is a liquid, so why can it float on top of another liquid? Isn't this a very strange thing? No, it's not strange! As long as we observe carefully, we will understand.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if we want to know whether something can float on the surface of water, the first condition is that we have to see whether this thing will dissolve in water. For example, if we take a piece of salt and put it in water, it will immediately disappear. This is the result of dissolution. The properties of oil are different from this. Not only does it not dissolve in water, but also the same volume of water is much lighter, so it can float on the surface of water.</p>
<p>Little friends, do you understand this small problem?</p>

<p>Explanation</p>
<p>(1) After visiting the Children's Science Museum, the Mei brothers are interested and ask the principal to hold a "Children's Science Homework Exhibition", with the products to be created by the students themselves.</p>
<p>(2) Mei Sheng and others take a walk early in the morning, wanting to find some materials for homework. From afar, they see many people moving around, and run to find out.</p>
<p>(3) After a while, the Air Force and the Army are mobilized. It turns out they are practicing scientific warfare. They are very moved and think that only science can save China at present. (4) The Mei brothers made models of the new military equipment they saw, in preparation for sending them to the exhibition.</p>
<p>(5) A corner of the "Children's Science Homework Exhibition", each work contains the meaning of saving the country with science.</p>

<p>(3) How Books are Printed</p>
<p>Little friends may want to ask me, how are the pictures in books printed?</p>
<p>Yes, this is a question worth exploring. The illustrations in books are sometimes printed using zinc plates, sometimes copper plates, and sometimes lithography.</p>
<p>Zinc and copper plates are usually attached to lead plates cast with lead type for printing. The method of making a zinc plate is to first photograph the original artwork onto a wet plate using a camera, then print it onto a clean zinc plate. The unwanted parts are then eaten away with chemicals, resulting in the finished plate. The method of making a copper plate is similar to that of making a zinc plate, except that a screen is added during photography. This screen is composed of small dots of varying sizes. The artwork with the screen is then printed onto a steel plate.</p>
<p>The above only applies to printing in a single color, which is commonly referred to as monochrome printing. To print beautiful colors, lithography is used. The process of lithography involves first separating the original artwork into several colors, tracing the lines with lithographic ink, one sheet for each color, and placing it onto a smooth stone slab that has been coated with chemicals. (Picture 4) The areas on the stone slab without ink will not absorb ink because they have been treated with chemicals, while the areas drawn with lithographic ink will absorb ink, allowing for the desired printing. Each color requires this process to be repeated. Therefore, the cost is much higher. Beautiful color pictures in ordinary books, as well as market paintings and calendars, are printed using this method.</p>
<p>In recent years, printing technology has become even more advanced, with the invention of collotype and photogravure, which can produce prints that are identical to the originals and do not fade, which is a great boon to the cultural world!</p>
<p>The artwork in (Picture 1) is printed using a zinc plate, while the artwork in (Picture 2) is printed using a copper plate. (Picture 3) shows an enlarged view of the screen.</p>

<p>— Xi</p>
<p>How uncomfortable it is for a bachelor to live in such an inn! I want to find my own kind and ask them to take me in. But I thought, "At night, all crows are gray, and it's impossible to tell which one is my own kind. Besides, it might be inconvenient to live next to them?"</p>
<p>First, I flew towards a ditch, where I saw many European rollers gathered. They were carefully doing their evening grooming. I saw that they all had golden wings and shiny claws—how beautiful! They were the dandies of the forest. They were very kind, but they didn't pay attention to me. All they talked about was empty and meaningless: some talked about their quarrels with people, and others talked about their pursuit of the opposite sex. They looked conceited, which I couldn't stand, so I couldn't stay here any longer.</p>
<p>"Then I perched on a branch and saw five or six different kinds of birds lined up there. I humbly stayed on the tip of the branch, hoping they would allow me to spend the night here. Unfortunately, the one next to me was an old turtledove, as dry as a weathervane on a roof. When I got close to her, she pretended to be tidying her sparse feathers, as if she was afraid of pulling one out. I accidentally touched her with the tip of my wing, and she straightened up proudly, puffed out her beak, and said, "Sir, what do you mean?" Then she elbowed me hard, knocking me down.</p>
<p>I fell into a pile of bushes and saw a fat female bunting sleeping peacefully. My mother was fat, but not as plump as she was. I secretly crawled next to her, saying to myself, "She certainly won't wake up. Even if she does, a good fat mother like her probably won't be angry with me." But the reality was not like that. She half-opened her eyes and sighed slightly, "Child, you're disturbing me! Get out of here quickly!"</p>
<p>At the same time, I heard someone calling me: it turned out that some thrushes were calling me to come over from the top of a rowan tree. I thought to myself, "I've finally met some good friends here. They raised their seats to let me stay, laughing like crazy!" I flapped my wings and flew straight into their midst. But before long, I saw that these ladies had eaten too many grapes, and their bellies were so swollen that they could hardly support the branches. Their dull jokes, crazy laughter, and frivolous songs all made me have to fly away.</p>
<p>I began to despair and decided to sleep in a quiet corner. At this moment, a nightingale began to sing. Everyone was silent. Oh! How clear his voice was, and how sweet it felt in his melancholy! His singing not only didn't disturb people's sleep, but it was like a lullaby that made people fall asleep peacefully. No one tried to stop him, and no one complained about him singing in the middle of the night; his father would never scold him, and his friends would never fly away when they heard his singing.</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Issue</p>
<h3 id="e174">Important Statistics of Telecommunications in the Past Four Years <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>——From the Fourth National Congress to the Fifth National Congress——</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress concluded on the 23rd of last month. With different ideas gathered together, and national policies decided through public discussions, to review the past and encourage the future, uniting with sincerity to save the nation, this is truly a grand event. I have read the Congress's declaration, which is plain and unadorned, with words filled with sorrow, pointing out the areas that require effort in the future, striking at the heart of current problems. The second item of the fourth section is to develop transportation to enrich the economy. Transportation is the lifeline of a country, and telecommunications is its nervous system. If the lifeline stops moving, it loses its vitality; if the nervous system is not functioning well, it loses its sense of awareness. Loss of awareness is no different from being lifeless. Therefore, the nervous system is the source of human thought, and the telecommunications system is the hub of national administration. In recent years, the Ministry of Transportation has made improvements to the postal and telecommunications industries. The various facts have been published in this journal, and there is no need to repeat them. However, from the Fourth National Congress to the Fifth National Congress, four years have passed. What are the achievements in telecommunications construction and reorganization? It is necessary to use concise statistical figures to illustrate it, for comparison and learning.</p>
<p>Based on the tables above, except for personnel and debt, there has been a considerable increase in everything else. In other words, consumption costs have been reduced as much as possible, while the scope of business has increased in various ways. Although the telecommunications industry is state-owned, it has not been subsidized by the national treasury. It is entirely operated by "using electricity to support electricity" and "using electricity to build electricity," starting with itself. Each year, about five million in telecommunications fees owed by government troops cannot be collected. Since the outbreak of national disasters, natural and man-made disasters have been pressing. Rural areas have gone bankrupt, markets have shrunk, and telecommunications business has been affected. Therefore, the telecommunications economy is extremely difficult in this environment! Although there are various plans, they cannot be realized as scheduled. However, the telecommunications authorities have overcome all difficulties with hard work and determination and have made rapid progress. Over the years, they have established a foundation and gained social sympathy. If they can maintain this spirit and redouble their efforts, there will be even more hopeful results at the Sixth National Congress.</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Characteristics of the New Telegraph Code Published by the Ministry of Transportation <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>Before 1929, the "New Telegraph Code" was only sold by private publishers. The content was very simple, and errors were unavoidable. Moreover, the "New Telegraph Code" sold by private publishers was only for profit. The paper was brittle and not durable, the printing was poor and harmful to the eyes, and the various telegraph regulations attached were often full of errors, either abolished or revised and supplemented, which could cause misunderstandings. In view of this, the Ministry of Transportation published a "New Telegraph Code" in October 1929, printed on durable Daolin paper, with accurate telegraph rules and bureau names attached, and the price was very low, only recovering the cost of one jiao per book. After the book was published, it was convenient for society. In August 1933, the Ministry of Transportation reprinted the code because the stock was sold out. The content was greatly improved, and the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The telegraph code is printed with Arabic numerals. The old telegraph code was printed with Chinese characters, such as "七一九三," which is now changed to "7193," which is exactly the same as the telegraph code written on the incoming and outgoing telegrams, making it more convenient to translate the telegraph code than before.</p>
<p>(2) Enlarging commonly used characters. There are more than 9,000 characters in the "New Telegraph Code," but only two or three thousand characters are commonly used in telegrams. For the convenience of searching, the commonly used characters are printed in large characters to make them conspicuous and easy to find.</p>
<p>(3) Adding stroke counts to characters of the same radical. There are many characters in the same radical, such as the water radical, wood radical, and metal radical. Searching for a character in that radical sometimes takes one or two minutes, which is extremely difficult. For the convenience of searching, the method of dividing strokes in dictionaries is used to add stroke counts under each line, so that after finding the radical, characters can be searched according to the number of strokes, saving time.</p>
<p>(4) Adding a table for easily searching difficult characters. The organization of Chinese characters is complex, and there are quite a few characters with unclear radicals. If only the radical table is used to search for characters, difficulties may still arise. Therefore, the characters with unclear radicals that are difficult to find are arranged in order according to the number of strokes in each character. Whenever encountering a character with a dubious radical, the number of strokes in the character can be calculated and found in this table immediately. The telegraph code is printed in the table at the same time, so when the character is found, the telegraph code is known, and there is no need to check the telegraph code in the main part of the book again.</p>
<p>(5) Adding a four-corner code difficult character lookup table. When encountering a character with an unclear radical, the number of strokes can be calculated and used to search the "Difficult Character Easy Lookup Table," as mentioned in the previous section, but Chinese characters have different forms, such as ancient, formal, cursive, and colloquial. When calculating the number of strokes, it is often because of being accustomed to colloquial or cursive characters that the calculated number is not accurate, so it is still impossible to find it immediately in the table. For example, the character "享" has eight strokes in its formal form and nine strokes in its colloquial form (享). Therefore, to make searching more convenient, the difficult-to-find characters are arranged according to the four-corner code, which can reduce the difficulty!</p>
<p>(6) Necessarily add needed characters (183). In recent years, the scope of telegraph applications has gradually expanded, so there is a great need to add characters. When compiling and printing this time, 183 new characters were added after review, and for the convenience of checking, a "New Added Character Code Reference Table" was specially compiled and attached for reference.</p>
<p>(7) Deleting 46 duplicate characters. There are many duplicate characters in the old version of the "New Telegraph Code." For example, the character "穴" is found in both the 宀 radical and the 穴 radical. The telegraph code in the 宀 radical is 1340, and the telegraph code in the 穴 radical is 4494. In order to avoid duplication and make it easier to remember the telegraph code, 46 duplicate characters with the same character but different codes have been deleted. However, the telegraph codes of the deleted characters will not be replaced temporarily to avoid misunderstandings. A special table is also printed for reference for these deleted duplicate characters.</p>
<p>(8) Using telegraph codes to represent dates and times. The date and time of telegrams were traditionally replaced by rhyme titles and time periods. For example, one day and twelve o'clock is replaced by the two characters "東午". Anyone who is not familiar with the rhyme titles must search the "Rhyme Title Date Replacement Table" once, which is extremely inconvenient. Now, the remaining telegraph codes are used to directly replace the date and time. From 9801 to 9824 represents one to twenty-four o'clock, and 9901 to 9913 represents the first to thirty-first day of the month. The first two codes of 98 replace the telegraph code for time, and 99 replaces the telegraph code for date, which is easy to remember without having to check the table.</p>
<p>(9) Special index of cipher page numbers. When compiling the code of "New Telegraph Code", the thousand and hundred digits of the new code on the corner are often not arranged in sequential order and are reversed. When translating incoming telegrams, it is very difficult to find them. For the convenience of translation, a special page index of cipher is prepared. The table is divided into two lines, one line arranges the first two digits of the cipher in order, and the other line fills in the page number where the cipher is located. The two are compared, and the translation is extremely convenient.</p>
<p>(10) Adding new Roman alphabet telegraph codes. Ordinary telegraph codes consist of four numerals. If sending to foreign countries, each character must be charged at the full price. Roman alphabet telegraph codes consist of three foreign letters. After the entire telegram is translated into this telegraph code, it can be concatenated into an international code of five letters per group, which is calculated at 60% of the full price per character, and the number of characters can be reduced. Each telegram can save 64% of the telegraph fee. It is much cheaper for overseas Chinese to use it to communicate with their motherland.</p>
<p>The above ten points are the characteristics of the improved version of the code. Therefore, sales were very rapid after publication, and it was sold out by the end of last year. The Ministry of Transportation reprinted the code because merchants from various places requested to purchase it and needed it very much. The content was greatly refreshed, and an appendix "Telecommunications Handbook" was added. It was printed in August of this year and has now been published. The content is richer and the printing is more sophisticated. The length is one-third longer than the original. It is said that the cost of each book is 3 jiao of national currency, but the Ministry of Transportation still sells each book for 2 jiao to promote it, because the code has some advertising revenue. In addition to the previous improvements that have been preserved, the code has the following improvements:</p>
<p>(1) Horizontal arrangement of character codes. The character codes of the old version of the "New Telegraph Code" were arranged in vertical lines. However, the telegraph codes use Arabic numerals, and there are Roman alphabet telegraph codes, which are usually arranged horizontally. After the character codes are arranged horizontally, the radicals and stroke counts printed on the side of the book can be compared with each line, which is much more convenient when checking characters. Also, the telegraph codes arranged on each page of the original code, such as the first page from 0001 to 0100, and the second page from 0101 to 0200, when translating incoming telegrams, a code of 0100 is often mistaken for being listed on the second page. When checking the second page, it is only discovered that the code is listed on the first page. In short, the telegraph codes listed on each page must have a telegraph code with a different hundred digit, which does not seem neat. Now it is changed to the first page from 0000 to 0099, and the second page from 0100 to 0199, so that it is completely consistent with the thousand and hundred digit telegraph codes annotated on the corner.</p>
<p>(2) Adding the appendix "Telecommunications Handbook". The unique feature of this newly published "New Telegraph Code" is the addition of the appendix "Telecommunications Handbook", which is very extensive, with a total of one hundred and fifty-five pages. In addition to the telegraph regulations, price lists, bureau names, etc., which are all included in the handbook, the following two items have been newly added:</p>
<p>(1) Chronological Table of Major Telecommunications Events. The Chinese public is very unfamiliar with the past history of domestic telecommunications. Few domestic publications record the past situation of telecommunications. Therefore, a chronological table of major telecommunications events in the past years has been compiled for the public to consult the past traces of telecommunications, which is very valuable.</p>
<p>(2) Description of the Current Status of Telecommunications. The development of China's telecommunications industry has been quite rapid in recent years. It is believed that the general situation is welcome to the Chinese people. Therefore, the current status of telecommunications is summarized and described so that the Chinese people have a general idea of the current status of telecommunications and are not too unfamiliar. A simple diagram of important national wireless communication circuits is attached for reference.</p>
<p>(This newly published "New Telegraph Code" is sold in telegraph bureaus and radio stations in various places, but it may arrive a little later in places farther from the capital. If you want to purchase it urgently, you can write to this newspaper office to purchase it on your behalf. In addition to the actual price of 2 jiao per book, a postage fee of 5 fen should be added, and 8 fen should be added for registration. Postage stamps are fully acceptable.)</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Legal Issue of Broadcasting Gramophone Records by Radio Stations Resolved <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Gramophone Record Company previously proposed six demands to the Tianhai Wireless Broadcasting Industry Association because the broadcasting of records by various broadcasting radio stations during broadcasting had a huge impact on the gramophone record business. Among the most important demands was that each broadcasting radio station must pay a copyright fee of 150 yuan per day for broadcasting records, to be paid in full on the first day of each month. If the above requirements were rejected, legal action would be taken, and it was said that a similar lawsuit had recently occurred in the UK, and the record company had won. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Transportation believed that broadcasting radio stations were an important tool for promoting public education. In addition to setting up broadcasting stations in Shanghai, Beiping, and other places, all private broadcasting radio stations in the country were under the supervision of the Ministry in accordance with the law. In order to attract listeners, these radio stations must appropriately include entertainment programs in addition to various educational programs to increase interest, and broadcasting records is the most convenient and economical of all entertainment programs. Therefore, the Ministry paid great attention to the above-mentioned requirements of the foreign record company. However, when the foreign company made the above requirements, it said that if it was not done, it would take legal action, because the record was also one of the publications or works, so it should enjoy copyright. If others want to publicly broadcast it, they must first obtain the consent of the author, otherwise it is an infringement of the author's interests. If this is the case, then the prerequisite question of this case is, according to the current copyright law and publication law in our country, can the record be regarded as a work or publication and enjoy copyright? If it can enjoy copyright, must all broadcasting radio stations obtain the consent of the record company to broadcast records by wireless radio? Once these two points are resolved, whether the requirements of the foreign record company are legal can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Although the Ministry of Transportation has studied the above-mentioned problems in detail, it has formally requested the Judicial Yuan to explain it for the sake of caution because it involves the law. Recently, the Judicial Yuan replied to the Ministry of Transportation that the case had been resolved by the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of the Judicial Yuan:</p>
<p>"Gramophone records are neither publications nor works, and there is no exclusive right to public performance. The purchaser can use it in any way based on their ownership, regardless of whether it is for personal entertainment or for public listening. The seller, manufacturer, and publisher shall not interfere."</p>
<p>According to the Unified Interpretation of Laws and Regulations Conference of the Judicial Yuan, it is the highest authority in the country for interpreting laws. Now that it is so firmly and clearly denying that gramophone records are works or publications and have no exclusive right to public performance, then there is no legal problem with broadcasting records by radio stations.</p>
<h3 id="e177">What Telephone Users are Expected to Do After the Implementation of the Call Inspection System <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongming</p>
<p>In order to promote the telephone business, the Ministry of Transportation has designated business inspectors of more than a dozen telegraph bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places to serve concurrently as local telephone business inspectors. This method has been implemented since October 1, and two months have passed so far. It is reported that based on the results of inspections in the past two months, the problems of the telephone business in various places can be summarized into two parts: one part occurs on the telephone bureau side, and the other part occurs on the user side. Now I am writing here to talk about it.</p>
<p>The problems that occur on the telephone bureau side are nothing more than: (1) Telephone bureau employees soliciting drinking expenses from users; (2) Lack of courtesy to users; (3) Slow connection by drivers; (4) Slow repair by the telephone bureau when machines are damaged, etc. These things do cause inconvenience and unpleasant feelings for users. However, these events are not what the telephone bureau wants, but only the actions of some irresponsible and disloyal employees. Therefore, the telephone authorities are very willing to thoroughly eliminate them. But before the elimination, we must first ask telephone users to cooperate closely with the telephone bureau. It is heard that when business inspectors in various places ask users whether there are any of the above-mentioned problems, many telephone users are willing to report the facts and ask for investigation; but there are not a few who are evasive and vague in their answers. The general idea of telephone users is to "treat people with kindness" and "make small things nothing," fearing that once reported, the person concerned will inevitably be subject to considerable punishment. But at the same time, they secretly resent the poor telephone business. We are very grateful to those who tell the truth! Because they have given great help to the improvement of the telephone business. As for those who generally feel dissatisfied but still endure and do not reveal the truth, I hope to change their attitude, because the poor telephone business causes great suffering to the users, and the telephone bureau also loses great reputation. If you do not tell the truth and cooperate, the telephone business will never be improved. All undertakings must be worked hard in many ways to be effective. The telephone business also needs to be worked hard in many ways to have full improvement potential. At the same time, I also hope that the public will release the power of sanctions, and don't have the previous misunderstanding and condone evil!</p>
<p>In the past few years, the Ministry of Transportation has been working hard to improve both the telegraph and telephone services. The purpose is nothing more than to seek convenience for the public. This fact should be known to the social people. The establishment of business inspectors, the main purpose is also here, their only task is to seek the contact between telegram and telephone users and the telephone bureau, so as to consult all matters that the public hopes from the telephone bureau, and report to the authorities for adoption and implementation. Therefore, users should thoroughly understand their mission and cooperate with them. If you encounter the above-mentioned problems, please report them at any time, and you will surely receive a satisfactory answer. If the telephone bureau finds that the situation is true, the employees who should be responsible will be punished in accordance with the regulations, and there will be no leniency or perfunctory handling. If you proceed in this way, you can achieve the effect of punishing one to warn a hundred.</p>
<p>As for the problems that occur on the telephone user side, they are nothing more than: (1) The type reported by the user does not match the actual situation; (2) Private installation of extensions, intercoms, or small switchboards; (3) Private relocation of machines, change of name, or transfer of ownership. Here, I do not want to discuss it from a moral or legal point of view, but only want to say something about the impact on the telephone business: First, falsely reporting the type and privately installing machines will reduce the telephone bureau's income and hinder the telephone bureau's economy. Second, private installation of extensions will increase the load on the telephone and shorten the life of the telephone. Third, private relocation of the telephone is easy to block the call, and if you are careless and accidentally touch the electric light line, the user will suffer even more. Fourth, private change of name or transfer of ownership is enough to disrupt the accuracy of telephone exchange and cause criticism from other users. All of this is greatly detrimental to telephone services.</p>
<p>Since the start of telephone business inspection, although it has only been two months, there have been many cases of the above-mentioned problems being discovered in various places. The telephone bureaus in various places have reported to the Ministry of Transportation to take practical measures in accordance with the city telephone business regulations, either imposing fines and making up fees, or removing the machine and suspending the call. I am afraid that telephone users in various places still have unclear situations and secretly take advantage of it, so I write it out to let them know to be vigilant and hope to correct it automatically as soon as possible to avoid being punished. In short, to seek the perfection and satisfaction of city telephone traffic, on the one hand, it depends on the telephone bureau's maintenance and proper handling, and on the other hand, the user's knowledge of following the regulations and cherishing the telephone machine is also a necessary condition. I sincerely hope that users will pay attention to it!</p>
<h3 id="e178">Trial Screening Report of Telecommunications Education Film <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Film Division of the Central Party Headquarters Propaganda Committee, in order to promote the domestic production and construction undertakings, recently went to various telecommunications agencies in Shanghai to produce a telecommunications education film. It captures various machinery and work conditions of wireless telegraph and telephone, and is accompanied by audio explanations, interpreting the principles and processing procedures of various telegraph and telephone machinery, so that viewers can understand the truth of telegraph and telephone within a few tens of minutes. After the film was produced, Director Zhang of the Film Section of the Central Propaganda Committee specially invited colleagues from the Ministry of Communications to visit. The reporter happened to be present and was able to get a glimpse of the whole picture, so I will roughly describe the trial screening situation as follows:</p>
<p>The location of the trial screening was in the newly completed Central Photography Studio. After the reporters and others entered the studio and sat down, they heard the sound of the machine running and the screening began. The screen was unveiled, and the first thing that caught our eyes was the familiar [missing word], followed by the words "Telecommunications Construction of the Ministry of Communications" and "Filming by the Film Division of the Central Propaganda Committee", followed by various machine operations in wired telegraphy and the performance of telegraph sending and receiving procedures. The working conditions of the Morse machine, the Wheatstone machine, the Hughes machine, and the printing telegraph were all demonstrated. The reception and delivery of reports in the receiving and sending offices, such as the receipt of incoming reports, the transcription and delivery of incoming reports, etc., were all performed vividly. Among them, the use of cartoon drawings to show the movements of the air tube delivery of telegrams in the receiving and sending office, the report room, is the clearest and most moving. The accompanying audio explanation is also relevant and easy to understand, which is also valuable. The second part is the performance of wireless telegraphy. The first is the working conditions of the manual sending and receiving machine, followed by the real picture of the automatic sending and receiving machine in the central receiving and sending room of the international radio station, and then various parts such as the generator, storage battery, antenna, and ground cable of the Liuheng and Fenglinqiao receiving stations and the Zhenru transmitting station are all photographed and added with brief explanations. The third part is the performance of various telephones. The first is the method of connecting the magneto telephone, and the situation of users talking to each other. The second is the connection and call status of the common battery telephone, and the third is the performance of the automatic telephone's machinery operation and call connection. Other equipment such as storage batteries, measuring platforms, and generators in the telephone bureau are also photographed. The entire film is 2,000 feet long and takes 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>After watching the film, the reporter deeply felt that this film gave us a deeper impression than any other method. In the future, when this film is screened in major theaters, not only will the telecommunications business that the Ministry of Communications has recently been keen to innovate be directly introduced to the audience, but the general public will also be able to instill in themselves common knowledge about telecommunications. It is truly the most ideal method of social education. After the visit, I picked up my pen and wrote it down.</p>

<h3 id="e180">What Modern Publics Should Know About Telecommunications <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— You Yu</p>
<p>A progressive country needs to stand on the line of the times, and the citizens of a progressive country also need to keep up with the times, because citizens are the backbone of the country. Can a country with all outdated citizens still shoulder the mission of progress? It is a necessary requirement of the new era for the telecommunications business to embark on the road of modernization and commercialization. Looking at the advanced countries in Europe and America, because of the development of science, they are all reforming and advancing towards the goals of modernization and commercialization. At the same time, their citizens have become as familiar with and use "telegraphs" as they do with "letters", and they firmly grasp the various facilities of the telegraph bureau for the convenience of public communication, and are unwilling to easily give up this right.</p>
<p>Looking back at the telecommunications and transportation in our country in recent years, during the period of severe national crisis, through the efforts of the transportation authorities to rectify and construct, and the thorough awakening and hard work of colleagues across the country, the practical contribution of gradually realizing the two slogans of "modernization" and "popularization" has been made. However, our sending public has always adhered to the traditional concept, and when it comes to telegrams, it seems that they must be urgent and serious matters, and they do not have a full understanding of the meaning of the above two slogans. This erroneous concept must be changed on the road to catching up with the times.</p>
<p>Therefore, our hope for the sending public and readers is that whenever we contribute a new set of rules or facilities, readers, please quickly study it, understand it, and use it! If there is anything that is not clear, the colleagues of the telegraph bureau or telephone bureau will sincerely answer it. For example, if you discover something in social situations, you can use social telegrams. If you want to talk to friends elsewhere, you can use long-distance calls. Or if you want to communicate with relatives and friends while sailing on a ship, you can use ship telegrams. You can also send travel telegrams to China Travel Service while traveling. Other services such as prepaid reply telegrams, follow-up telegrams, split telegrams, held telegrams, mail-forwarded telegrams, route-forwarded telegrams, and voice telegrams are all available at the sender's convenience. Now the Ministry of Communications has adopted the general method of jointly establishing postal and telecommunications offices, so telegrams or telephones can be sent or received in every place, which is even more convenient. In recent years, all kinds of reforms in telecommunications facilities have been aimed at facilitating the public. The progress of the telecommunications era is truly rapid!</p>
<p>In short, we hope that the public will grasp the times and deeply understand the meaning of telecommunications modernization and popularization; at the same time, we must stand on the international parallel line and catch up with the times to serve the public.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Radio Wireless in the Italo-Ethiopian War <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>——Excerpt from the October report of the US Joint Company——</p>
<p>According to William A. Winterbuttom, Vice President and General Manager of the No-Money Radio Joint Company, the British Post Office's cancellation of the Italian representative's scheduled radio speech in Geneva has aroused serious attention to the complete independence of American wireless telecommunications since the war. The fully-equipped receiving stations under the organization of the Joint Company are able to listen to broadcasts from any country or other place. The broadcasts from both sides of the same event, which are related to the United States, can also be listened to. If one party is unable to broadcast directly, other countries must be prepared to broadcast for it. Last Sunday, the Italian representative, Sir Aloysius, broadcasted a radio speech directly to the American radio network from Rome, which Mr. Winterbuttom considered to be the best example. Because the London Radio Station originally scheduled to broadcast Sir Aloysius' radio speech in Geneva via the Atlantic Ocean, but the British Post Office suddenly stated that the station could not be used for the speech when the deadline arrived. Regardless of whether this was the result of technical difficulties or because the United Kingdom was a member of the League of Nations and was affected by the implementation of sanctions, the broadcast was still not prevented from being heard in the United States. Because after Sir Aloysius returned to Rome, he broadcast his delayed speech directly to the United States through his own country's radio station. The broadcast was received by the Joint Company's Riverhead Radio Station and distributed to Columbia Wireless Communications according to the scheduled method. The rebroadcast was very successful. The company has rebroadcasted the declaration of the Afghan representative in Geneva, and now, according to American broadcasting policy, it has made public the opinions of both sides of the event.</p>
<p>The United States has listened to the broadcasts directly from the capitals of Italy and Afghanistan, Italy and Afghanistan, and especially felt wonderful when listening to the speech of the King of Afghanistan. Because its broadcast was not only from the indigenous Di Fa Radio Station in Africa, but its machinery only used a new standard shortwave transmitter with less than five points of power.</p>
<p>The benefits of wireless communication are obviously significant. The telegraphic symbols reach inland towns or coastal areas with the same convenience. There are no political boundaries, and there is no need for relaying or inspection along the way. This widespread global wireless organization is not only limited to communication with foreign countries, but its great effect is far-reaching. With modern wireless communication, it is possible to transmit photos of Abyssinian military operations within 24 hours.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Head in a Pile of Iron Buckets <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Xun</p>
<p>A few days ago, a newspaper from another city published a piece of news about an iron bucket crushing a rickshaw driver's head, saying that a beer company wanted to move to a new location, and because they were reluctant to spend more than 20 yuan to hire a truck, someone contracted the job and hired a tiger cart (also known as a collapsing cart) to transport the goods. They stacked pairs of iron buckets full of beer on top of each other, but the iron buckets exceeded the weight that the collapsing cart could bear, causing the axle to break. The iron buckets on top rolled down and crushed the rickshaw driver's head into a "meat pie", and the brain was splashed everywhere. The rickshaw driver died on the spot. This tragic human incident is truly unbearable to witness and hear!</p>
<p>Because the rickshaw driver's head was crushed by the iron bucket, some people thought that the culprit should be the iron bucket, because why should the iron bucket be so heavy? Some people think that the axle of the tiger cart is too weak, and the main culprit should be the tiger cart that cannot withstand the weight. Some people even complain that the rickshaw driver himself is not good, why should he load so heavy goods, and why should he do this lowly and dangerous business? But these many people will not really recognize the main culprit of the disaster.</p>
<p>That's right, the rickshaw driver's head was crushed by the iron bucket, but why did the iron bucket crush the rickshaw driver's head? I think the key to the problem lies in the fact that the company wanted to save more than 20 yuan. It seems a bit strange that such a big company is reluctant to spend tens of dollars more on transportation costs, but it is not strange at all. They only know how to save costs and how to increase revenue. They have never taken the safety of workers' lives into account. In the metropolis of the foreign concessions, among the hundreds of thousands of workers who are wringing out the blood and tears of their lives, among the batches of workers who are swallowed up by the machine wheels, isn't the death of a tiger cart driver just a grain of sand in the Ganges River?</p>
<p>Regarding rickshaw drivers, humanitarians do not take rickshaws for the sake of humanitarianism; kind administrative authorities limit the number of rickshaw drivers for the sake of "rationalization"; their goodwill is commendable. But the former humanitarian is just an ostrich, he buries his head in the desert, thinking that he has escaped all evils "out of sight, out of mind". The latter also did not diagnose the cause of the public's life.</p>
<p>But the tragedy is real. Taking the life of a natural person other than oneself is called murder. Taking a step back, the responsible person of the company has committed the criminal charge of negligent homicide. The contractor who helps the evildoer and profits from it is also suspected of being an accomplice, and should be handed over to the authorities for punishment. If the law says so, this minimum mission of guaranteeing human rights can still be achieved!</p>

<h3 id="e183">Shanghai Forty-Two Years Ago <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zheng</p>
<p>——A Tour of the Old Shanghai Exhibition——</p>
<p>From the 26th of this month for two weeks, the people of Shanghai can have the opportunity to see the old Shanghai of forty-two years ago, because the "Old Shanghai Exhibition" is being held on the fourth floor of 55 Yuanmingyuan Road.</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai should remember that this year, at the Lyceum Theatre on Baoshi Road, Ms. Tang Ying, a former Shanghai celebrity, and some of her foreign friends starred in a play in Chinese ancient costumes but spoken in foreign languages. That was the English Chinese play "Wang Baochuan" also known as "Red Oriole" written by Xiong Shiyi. One of those foreigners, Mrs. Ritz, is indeed a drama fan, and can be said to be one of the people who likes Chinese art the most. She once hosted a grand tea dance party at Sassoon Garden on Hongqiao Road to welcome Dr. Mei, the king of actors who returned from Russia. The invitation she printed was very interesting. In the upper left corner of the invitation, she printed a pattern, which drew an old woman and Guan Gong's facial makeup, and had the letters IAT, which was the symbol of the "International Arts Theatre" she presided over. This lady is also one of the initiators who are most enthusiastic about supporting the "Old Shanghai Exhibition" and promoting its success.</p>
<p>The opening time of this exhibition is 5:15 pm on the 26th. It means to welcome the people of Shanghai to visit after office hours every day. They also invited Dr. Fei Mu, who is very familiar with the stories of Shanghai, to give a lecture. The topic of the lecture is "Shanghai Forty-Two Years Ago". The things that Dr. Fei Mu talked about are all supported by poems. After listening to his lecture, you can immediately find a lot of evidence in the exhibition, such as the paintings and photos hanging on the wall, the utensils and utensils arranged on the floor, and the large and thick books on the table.</p>
<p>When visitors arrive on the fourth floor, a Western lady will greet them with a smile and ask them to buy a ticket (one silver dollar). Entering the exhibition room, the first thing you see is a blackboard with some English written on it in white chalk, which is nothing more than the name of the exhibition, the exhibition period, the price of the admission ticket, and the name of the organizer. The room is neither high nor low, only the size of an ordinary theater stage. In the center, a platform was built, about one foot higher than the ground (Dr. Fei Mu stood on this platform to give lectures). A very large map was placed horizontally on the stage, and the color was already dark and there were many small damages. It was so old! Looking closely, it turned out to be a map of the Shanghai Concession 103 years ago, which was drawn by the French Concession authorities.</p>
<p>Next to a pillar on the front right side of the stage, a large clock was placed on a wooden frame, which was also antique. The four characters "Fulian Zen Temple" were engraved on the front, and the years of Guangxu 19th year and Xu Ruiji Foundry were engraved on one side. It is said that 35 years ago, this clock was hanging in the pagoda of the Fulian Zen Temple in Ningbo. Because the pagoda and the temple were burned down, it was transported to Shanghai. Try knocking it, the sound is very loud. According to a foreign lady who was entertaining guests next to her, "China is now preparing to manufacture a clock that is more than ten times larger than this. Is this the only metal casting art that the Chinese regard as?" The reporter was ashamed to be an amateur and dared not answer. However, there are many devout men and women who are working hard to promote the Heavenly Clock of Jiuhua Mountain. Moreover, it seems that in fact, the Buddhist practice of wasting people and money is also praised as a magnificent achievement of ancient art! So, the foreign lady understands art!</p>
<p>Next to another pillar on the front left side of the stage, there is a wardrobe, which is completely vermilion lacquer, about eight feet high. The red lacquer color is bright and clean, which is indeed a representative work of China. Next to the wardrobe is a long incense table, which is the kind of large and long incense table that used to be placed in front of the screen door in the main hall of old-fashioned Shanghai families. By custom, most of them put a large self-ringing clock in the middle, an antique porcelain vase on the side, and a marble screen on the right. In front of the incense table are an eight-immortal table, two master chairs, and so on. There are photos on the incense table, which are some of the landscapes of Shanghai's changes in the past 50 years. On the wall opposite the incense table are two spring benches, with the same dark lacquer as the incense table, and the light can illuminate people. The walls of the spring bench display are full of old Shanghai maps, but they are limited to the concessions. From 103 years ago to 53 years ago, there are hanging pictures, and from 50 years ago, there have been many photos. According to the reporter's speculation, the things from 42 years ago and later are better in the system, and it can be seen that special attention has been paid to the collection of these materials since 42 years ago!</p>
<p>According to the elders, Shanghai forty-two years ago did not have electric lights at that time, only gas lights, that is, gas lamps. There were already paddle steamers and small steamers towing civilian ships from Shanghai to Suzhou. The famous Four Horse Road in Shanghai at that time had five-story buildings, teahouses such as Qingliang Pavilion and Chuixiao Pin Yu Lou. Opium smoking was sold openly; the five-story building and Qingliang Pavilion were divided into front and back halls, with tea seats in the front hall and smoke shops (with pit-beds and tables) in the back hall. At that time, foreigners were not as pretentious as they are now, but Cantonese and Ningbo people were more pretentious. In the Old Shanghai Exhibition, there is a record book of Jardine Matheson, in which you can still find the foreigners' petitions to the Chinese government, in which they call themselves Yi Min and call the Chinese government officials adults. This was the situation before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, and after the Sino-Japanese War (forty years from today), it went from bad to worse.</p>
<p>In the Jardine Matheson record book of the exhibition, there is a notice-like thing posted as follows. You can see how pretentious the foreign businessmen were. The notice was written by Jardine, the consul of the Yellow Flag stationed in Guangdong: To the effect that the name of the boatman in Huangpu, Sansheng (a contractor), is accompanied by 40 sailors, who are going to ×× to wait for the news of the British steamer's monthly letter, and rushing to the province. I hope that the patrol boat along the way will open the letter and check it before letting it go, and do not delay it for a long time, lest it delay the company. This is a real letter of credence. According to its English explanation, it was written by the Danish consul in Guangdong for Jardine Matheson. A certificate from a foreign consul can pass through the Chinese Kexun patrol boat. This was already commonplace in the 28th year of Daoguang. Next to the Jardine Matheson record book is full of photos, which fully show the changes in uniforms in Shanghai from more than 50 years ago to the present. There are uniform styles for the army (limited to the jurisdiction of the Public Works Bureau), staff, and many other employees. There are also many portraits of farmers, workers, merchants, and farmers in the streets and alleys. Although it feels a bit messy, you can also see a lot of the scenery of old Shanghai there.</p>
<p>In the eyes of those foreign ladies who are in charge of this exhibition, the nature of this exhibition is mostly seen from the perspective of novelty and antiques; but in the eyes of us Shanghai people, it is not difficult to find many traces of turning from masters to slaves. I think that all Shanghai people should pay attention to this point, and in the future, Shanghai people should prepare for the exhibition themselves.</p>
<p>Industry Survey</p>
<h3 id="e184">The "Used Leather Shoes" Industry in Harbin <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Ren</p>
<p>In Harbin, there are many unique industries that surprise newcomers. Take the selling of used leather shoes, for example. This small-scale business wouldn't be an industry anywhere else, but here it holds a significant commercial position, even though their business locations aren't formal shops.</p>
<p>This business of selling used leather shoes is commonly known here as the "black business." They gather in both Daoli and Daowai districts. During the time when the Russians held power here, their business was very prosperous. Now, because most of the residents here don't need to wear leather shoes, they only rely on a portion of Chinese people and passing merchants to patronize their business.</p>
<p>The reason why selling used leather shoes is called "black business" is that their business hours are entirely at night, and the locations where they gather are chosen next to dimly lit roads, so that customers, even with their best vision, can't discern any flaws on the leather shoes, because only in this way can transactions be easily successful.</p>
<p>It is said that Harbin used to have more than 500 places involved in this used leather shoe industry, directly or indirectly supporting at least ten to twenty thousand people. Now, because business is slow, only about three hundred shoe stalls remain. However, compared to other cities, the number is probably still considerable. Every night at dusk, no matter which road you step on, you can see a few dimly lit shoe stalls. A piece of blue cloth, about ten feet square, displays rows and rows of leather shoes. The leather shoes are shiny and lustrous, and at first glance, they look even more attractive than new leather shoes in a shoe store. Because they excessively embellish those old leather shoes, passersby are often drawn to admire them for a while. If someone hasn't lived in Harbin for long and sees this kind of "cheap and good" (?) merchandise, they will inevitably be driven by greed to buy them.</p>
<p>As for the styles of leather shoes on these used leather shoe stalls, probably even a decent shoe store can't match their variety. They have women's new-style high-heeled shoes, flat shoes, the most popular cut-out floral shoes, children's strap shoes, high-soled shoes, men's pointed-toe shoes, round-toe shoes, American-style leather shoes, Russian-style leather shoes, military riding boots... all kinds of men's and women's leather shoes are available. The source of these used leather shoes is quite thought-provoking. The main source, of course, is "second-hand" from those who "collect junk." The next source is being intertwined with the stolen goods market. Buying and selling used leather shoes, this in and out, although connected, are operated independently. Buying used leather shoes is done by "junk collectors." In addition to buying newspapers, glass bottles, broken clothes, sundries, etc., what they welcome most are used leather shoes. After the used leather shoes are collected, they are carried to the "junk market" and resold to leather shoe repairmen. In this transfer process, "junk collectors" earn at most only one or two dimes per pair. The ones who enjoy high profits are those shoemakers with repair skills and leather shoe "dealers" with sufficient capital. In addition, stolen goods from petty thieves are directly purchased by leather shoe "dealers," and "junk collectors" are not allowed to intervene. Because most leather shoe "dealers" have some hidden power, most thieves need to rely on their protection. However, in this industry, there are also so-called "trusts" and other business organizations. A "trust" leader must possess both financial and human resources. They must have a large amount of capital to buy goods that others dare not buy, and they must also have the power to "pull strings" for any "mishaps" that occur when buying goods. With this power, they can simultaneously operate buying, repairing, and selling. However, very few people in the used leather shoe industry have this ability. Most of the others only do repair work and don't also sell. Those who sell are not good at repairing. At most, they are repairmen during the day and become the owners of used leather shoes at night.</p>
<p>The usual value of a pair of used leather shoes is at most only thirty cents when buying, but after being resold by the "junk collector," it will be sold for about fifty or sixty cents. After going through the hands of repairmen and leather shoe "dealers," the price increases to two yuan and several dimes. Although this profit is very high, buyers don't feel it's expensive. Because in Harbin, buying a pair of high-quality leather shoes costs more than ten yuan, and even a slightly inferior pair costs seven or eight yuan. Compared to a pair of used leather shoes for more than two yuan, the latter is certainly cheaper. Moreover, the cost of nailing the front and back soles of a pair of leather shoes usually costs one yuan and seventy or eighty cents! Therefore, the petty bourgeoisie with limited financial means are still happy to be customers of those used shoe stalls.</p>
<p>The capital of a shoe stall varies greatly. The largest ones have three to five hundred yuan, while the smallest ones have only over a hundred yuan. The owners of these stalls are sometimes people who made money from "collecting junk" and changed careers to sell used leather shoes. Some are unemployed shoe workers who, without formal work, pool some money to start their own "business." Large shoe stalls sometimes don't have enough capital on their own, so they gather three to five people to operate in partnership. Small stalls are mostly operated independently. However, why are some people willing to partner to run a large stall instead of operating independently? There is a "big fish eats small fish" effect. Because shoe stalls with large capital can absorb goods from all sides, such as pointed-toe, wide-toe, round-toe, slightly convex, square, as well as Russian-style, Japanese-style, and local styles, they can accommodate all kinds of different customers to choose from, and the business will naturally be more prosperous. However, shoe stalls with small capital dare not absorb these kinds of goods in large quantities. Most of what they have are some common styles, so they can only accommodate fewer customers. In addition, large shoe stalls have lower interest because their business is prosperous. But small shoe stalls cannot do this because they don't have many shoe styles, and it's hard to expect a few customers to visit in a day. If they sell too cheaply, there's not much profit. Therefore, small shoe stalls generally don't want to be neighbors with large shoe stalls, but because they cannot withstand the pressure of capital.</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Restoration Movements in Greece and Austria <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Ren</p>
<p>Recently, two European countries have experienced restoration movements: Greece, one of the important countries in the Balkan Peninsula, and Austria, a country known for its troubles. Now, the restoration movement in Greece has been successful. King George II has already returned to Athens and will soon exercise his royal power, commissioning the formation of a new government. As for the restoration movement in Austria, it is currently underway and is quite intense. Whether it can achieve victory like Greece is still a big question. However, the success of the restoration movement in Greece and the ongoing restoration movement in Austria are not only problems for these two countries but also have a significant impact on the overall situation in Europe. Therefore, we will discuss both of them together here.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the restoration in Greece. On the surface, the re-emergence of imperial politics in Greece seems to be entirely the result of the national referendum held in November. In fact, the struggle between the monarchists and republicans in Greece has a long history and complex international relations.</p>
<p>Greece is a semi-colonial country, and all its internal events are deeply related to the European powers. We can easily understand the significance of the Greek monarchists' great victory if we simply look at the fact that the Greek restoration movement occurred at the very moment when the United Kingdom and Italy were in sharp opposition in the Mediterranean. Geographically, Greece is bordered by the Aegean Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the west. Its coastline is the longest in the world, and it has many bays and islands, most of which are very important. It is a country valued by European powers, especially the United Kingdom and Italy, in their competition in the Mediterranean and the Balkans. If Italy were to acquire Greece and use its geographical advantages, it would be possible to seize Malta, the United Kingdom's base in the Mediterranean, at any time and further drive the British out of the Mediterranean. Conversely, the United Kingdom must obtain the active assistance of Greece to contend with Italy in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Italy have always been secretly competing for Greece, and the Greek royalists have developed under the support of the United Kingdom. Recently, due to the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, the conflict between the United Kingdom and Italy in the Mediterranean has become even more acute and realistic. In order to actively use Greece to contain Italy, the British took advantage of Italy's involvement in East Africa to encourage the Greek royalists to announce the abandonment of the republic and implement the monarchy as soon as possible. Originally, the implementation of the monarchy in Greece was to be decided by a referendum last month, but Greek Army Chief and royalist leader Kondylis, fearing that the opportunity would be missed, instigated the military on October 10 to force the Tsaldaris cabinet to resign. The National Assembly then announced the abolition of the republic and welcomed George II back to the throne. Kondylis appointed himself regent and temporarily formed an interim transitional cabinet. As a result, the November referendum was held under the manipulation of the royalists. The results showed that 1,527,712 people participated in the vote, of which 1,491,992 voted in favor of the monarchy, 32,454 voted in favor of the republic, and 3,268 votes were invalid. The monarchists won an overwhelming victory with a majority of 90%. However, this victory of the Greek monarchists was also a victory for the United Kingdom in Greece.</p>
<p>Of course, the realization of the Greek restoration has not only external relations but also internal causes. In fact, after five or six years of economic panic, the poverty of the countryside, the decline of the cities, the increase in unemployment, and the increasingly painful lives of the general public have made it impossible for this small country to maintain a peaceful state. Extraordinary phenomena such as so-called political strikes have become commonplace in Greece in the past few months. Obviously, it was the military coup led by Greek Liberal Party leader Venizelos in March of this year, which involved a part of the army and navy, that caused the Greek civil war that shook Europe. Although this was a military coup on the surface, a large number of people participated in the event, making it a popular movement in Greece on the other hand. In this situation, the tendency of the two extremes of Greek politics has become an obvious fact. In order to attack the republicans and suppress the people, the monarchists, with the support of the United Kingdom, seized the opportunity to implement the restoration in advance and abolish the republican system.</p>
<p>Originally, since the Greek monarchists won the election in 1933, the power of the monarchists has been secretly expanding after Tsaldaris, the leader of the People's Party close to the monarchy, formed a cabinet. After the Venizelos coup in March of this year was suppressed, the power of the Greek republicans was greatly hit, and royalist leader Kondylis seized control of the Greek government by putting down the internal unrest. Afterwards, the monarchists continued to attack the republicans and gradually launched a restoration movement. But at this time, the republicans still had considerable power, and few of the general public supported the restoration, so after the cabinet reshuffle in July, the royalists still did not dare to openly advocate for the restoration. Recently, after the royalists had made sufficient preparations, they took advantage of the conflict between the United Kingdom and Italy to carry out a restoration coup in advance without waiting for a referendum. They abolished the republic and realized the monarchy in one fell swoop. This is the recent history of the Greek restoration.</p>
<p>Now, George II has returned to Athens, and the fact that Greece has changed from a republic to a monarchy has become a reality. There is certainly no question about that. But whether the volatile Greece can be stable in the future is still a question. First of all, the restoration in Greece is naturally supported by the United Kingdom. Even France, because of its relationship with the Little Entente and Kondylis, and in order to deal with Italy in the Mediterranean, does not oppose it. However, Italy is not very happy about the restoration in Greece. Although George II passed through Rome and met with the Italian King and Mussolini when he returned to his country, Italy still does not want the royalists to hold power in Greece in its heart. Now, Mussolini is focusing on East Africa and certainly has no time to take care of the Balkans or Greece, but who can say that Italy will not continue to operate in Greece in the future? Secondly, the realization of the Greek restoration has not solved the fundamental problems of the domestic economy and politics, and the power of the Republicans has not been completely lost. In the future, anti-monarchical movements may continue to occur in Greece. Therefore, although the Greek royalists and the United Kingdom behind them have won a temporary victory, Greece and even Europe will still not be stable in the future.</p>
<p>The second is the ongoing restoration movement in Austria. Originally, the restoration movement in Austria had a long history, but it had not been realized in the past because the Austrian-Hungarian problem was too complex and serious. Recently, at a time when Europe is troubled, the restoration movement in Austria has become more intense, and Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Vice-Chancellor Prince Starhemberg have also participated in restoration demonstrations. Therefore, the Austrian problem has once again become one of the important issues that European countries are paying attention to.</p>
<p>The complexity and importance of the Austrian problem have been discussed too much in other publications, and we do not want to explain it in detail here. What we want to say now is only the current restoration movement in Austria. The mastermind behind this movement is undoubtedly Italy. Because once the Austrian restoration is realized, it will inevitably affect Hungary, and as a result, Austria-Hungary will become attached to Italy, and Italy will dominate Central Europe and become the leader of the Danube. According to Havas, because "a noble of the old Habsburg royal family of Austria has formed a marital alliance with a princess of Italy," Italy does not resolutely oppose the restoration in Austria. This is certainly a formalistic view. However, from the fundamental interests of Italy and Austria, Italy not only does not oppose the restoration in Austria but also wants it to be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>However, France's satellite Little Entente will feel a headache when they hear that Austria is going to be restored. Because if the Austrian restoration is realized, Hungary will be affected, and as a result, Austria-Hungary will merge, cutting the Little Entente in the middle and preventing them from contacting each other. At the same time, Hitler, who is plotting the annexation of Austria and Germany, certainly does not want Austria to be restored. Therefore, after the news of the development of the restoration movement in Austria spread, the Little Entente, France, and Germany all expressed their firm opposition. Although the United Kingdom has not yet expressed its attitude, it can be expected that it will not support the restoration in Austria when it is trying to change the nature of the imperialist Second World War by solving the Austrian problem. In this situation, we can say that the restoration movement in Austria will never be as smooth as that in Greece, and its victory is unlikely in the near future.</p>
<p>In short, the realization of the restoration in Greece and the development of the restoration movement in Austria are both manifestations of the contradictions of the European powers. This is not surprising in troubled Europe.</p>

<h3 id="e186">The Suez Canal <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Liang</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, there have been rumors that the League of Nations would blockade the Suez Canal. For a time, the name "Suez Canal" was almost more valued than the Mediterranean. Because the Suez Canal is geographically located on the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt, connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, it is a vital transportation route. With it, the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa are connected. If the Suez Canal is really blockaded, it will be very difficult for Italian troops to be transported to East Africa. As a result, not only will the situation of the Italian-Ethiopian War change, but the Italian colonies in East Africa may also have problems. Therefore, if the United Kingdom were to blockade the Suez Canal, Italy would very likely resist by force, which would result in the faster outbreak of the Second World War. This is why people are paying special attention to the Suez Canal at this time.</p>
<p>Speaking of the history of the Suez Canal, we can easily think of the division of Africa by the European powers in the 19th century. Around 1850, apart from Egypt, an ancient civilized country in Africa, the other parts of Africa were still unknown to the world. Later, due to the urgent demand for colonies by the European powers, many explorers went deep into the interior of Africa to explore. Then merchants and politicians came to this "dark and mysterious continent." Then people knew that Africa also has huge inland seas, magnificent rivers and waterfalls, exotic fruits, flowers, plants and insects, great and beautiful forests and mountains, strange and terrifying wild beasts, and abundant products. For the convenience of colonizing Africa and for the convenience of invading Asia, countries such as the United Kingdom and France implemented the construction of the Suez Canal. The construction was presided over by the Frenchman Lesseps. It took ten years from 1859 to 1861 to complete, costing 200 million yuan, with a total length of 87 miles. Because of this canal, Europeans not only easily colonized Africa but also more easily invaded Asia. For example, the United Kingdom in India, Burma, the Malay Islands, France in Indochina, the Netherlands in the Malay Archipelago, Italy in East Africa, and the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Portugal, and Belgium in Africa all relied on the Suez Canal as a transportation line to carry out their invasions. Therefore, the European powers paid great attention to Su</p>

<p>ez Canal and have signed strict treaties to protect the safety of the canal.</p>
<p>The Suez Canal is operated by the Suez Canal Universal Company, which obtained a 99-year right of use from the Egyptian government. The company has a total of 800,000 shares, of which more than 353,000 are in the hands of the British government. The reason why the United Kingdom holds so many shares is that it bought 176,600 shares from Egypt in 1875. In addition to the United Kingdom, the remaining shares are scattered among the French people. However, the Canal Company does not have absolute political authority. Because the canal is still a part of Egyptian territory, and the Canal Company has confirmed that the Egyptian government has the right to protect and police the canal without prejudice to the freedom of navigation.</p>
<p>In October 1888, representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and Egypt held a conference in Constantinople and concluded a treaty stipulating the neutrality of the Suez Canal. The main points of the treaty are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Suez Canal shall be free to navigate in wartime or peacetime, regardless of the nationality of the ship.</p>
<p>2.  Belligerent acts are prohibited within three miles of the canal and its mouth.</p>
<p>3.  When warships of belligerent countries pass through the canal, they are not allowed to stay in the port of Suez for more than 24 hours unless they encounter irresistible events such as natural disasters.</p>
<p>4.  After the warships of the belligerent countries pass, the warships of the opposing party cannot depart until 24 hours have passed.</p>
<p>5.  The Turkish Emperor and the Egyptian King have police power over the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>Therefore, the powers are not allowed to act arbitrarily on the Suez Canal. For example, during the Russo-Japanese War, although Japan was an ally of the United Kingdom at the time, the British had to acquiesce to the passage of Russian warships through the Suez Canal to attack Japan. Again, during the Italian-Turkish War in 1911, although Egypt was the territory of Turkey, it could not prevent the Italian navy from freely traveling in the canal. From this, we can see the attitude of the powers towards the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>However, when the so-called emergency really comes, the powers will not abide by the treaty. In fact, although the Suez Canal has the above provisions and there have been facts of compliance with the provisions in the past, there have still been three blockades. First, when the Egyptian revolution against the Egyptian Governor occurred, the British army seized the canal for three days and prohibited ships from passing through. Second, when Spain and the United Kingdom were at war in 1898, the canal authorities prohibited the Spanish fleet from loading coal while navigating the canal. Third, during the Great War in Europe, the canal was temporarily blocked due to the entry and exit of Turkish warships. Naturally, except for these short periods, the canal maintained a normal state of free navigation during the long-term war.</p>
<p>In 1919, although the Paris Peace Conference decided that Egypt was a British protectorate, the United Kingdom obtained the right to protect the Suez Canal at the Paris Peace Conference. When it recognized the independence of Egypt in 1922, it still declared that it would retain this right. Egypt has never recognized this statement by the United Kingdom, it is only a unilateral statement by the United Kingdom. But therefore, everything in Egypt is still subject to British control. When the United Kingdom and Egypt signed a treaty in 1929, the United Kingdom made a further expression on the independence of Egypt on the surface, but it still used the pretext of protecting the Suez Canal to station considerable troops in Egypt and still interfered in Egypt's internal affairs in practice.</p>
<p>Because the United Kingdom can control Egypt, obtain the right to protect the Suez Canal, and hold a majority of the shares, the actual power of the canal is now mostly in the hands of the British. At present, Italy's expedition to East Africa is threatening British interests, but the British have not resolutely blockaded the Suez Canal to trouble Italy because they are afraid of the international situation and dare not act arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Now, the Egyptian independence movement is developing, and the atmosphere of war in East Africa continues to rise, and the results will have a great impact on the situation in the Suez Canal. Let's watch.</p>

<p>— Pu Yu</p>
<p>"Of course. My relationship helped the other day, but if you weren't greedy for a bargain, it wouldn't have become a reality. You only paid 400 yuan in tax for over 200 *dan* of wine (equivalent to over 20,000 *jin* by pound measurement). To be honest, I was considerate of the merchants' situation and didn't want you to pay more. What good did I get out of it myself?..."</p>
<p>"It's not my fault, if... if it goes to the provincial bureau, it's not... it's not me personally who suffers!"</p>
<p>Damn it, you can't judge a book by its cover; he even has the audacity to appeal! I was just preparing to attack him again, but luckily old Jiang stepped up for me:</p>
<p>"Boss Li, you have no grounds for defense. You say you paid taxes, do you have any evidence? Did the director give you a receipt for the money? Relying solely on verbal statements in official matters will subject you to punishment for slandering public officials! Not to mention, our director was originally kind-hearted, who knew you would offend others and get secretly reported. This time, the provincial bureau's official matter is solely focused on your tax evasion, and we only have the responsibility to handle it."</p>
<p>The old man's face turned increasingly green, his throat swelled up, and his hands kept clenching and unclenching. I could see the anger, resentment, sadness, and anxiety in his heart; he was also preparing methods of struggle. Finally, he suddenly became excited and said resolutely:</p>
<p>"Fine! I only blame myself for opening a brewery, I'm just giving money away and accompanying you to a lawsuit!"</p>
<p>At this moment, I was annoyed and anxious, feeling that the old man had turned into a stubborn wild beast; not listening to my command, not restrained by me. But perhaps it was a last flash of defiance, and I would ultimately deliver him a fatal blow.</p>
<p>"Damn it, a lawsuit? The common people going against public officials is just asking for trouble!" I cursed in my heart. Indeed, if the old man really overestimated himself and wanted to oppose me, then don't blame me for being unscrupulous; I would immediately report him to the provincial bureau with an official document, falsely accusing him of tax evasion, and find a few people to testify. Where would he go to argue? But then again, I didn't want to cause trouble either, as long as the old man could stay within my control. So I deliberately put on a peaceful face and softened my voice:</p>
<p>"Boss Li, I, Liu, am a good friend! The other day, I collected less tax from you out of consideration, and today, it's for official matters - but I didn't use any official pretense, I'm speaking entirely out of personal friendship, but you insist on putting on a stern face and accompanying me to a lawsuit..." I paused for two minutes, watching his expression, "Have you decided?" Seeing that he still showed a stubborn unwillingness to yield, I felt that I had to crush his resistance: "Fine! Then I'll have to be rude!"</p>
<p>So I ordered Jiang Xiwu to open his briefcase and take out the ultimate weapon: the red list and seals. The old man's overly frightened eyes were fixed on Jiang Xiwu's movements. I took the red list and read it to him very sternly: (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e189">Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Finally Realized on the Screen</p>
<p>When "A Midsummer Night's Dream" A Midsummer Nigit Dream opens, if ghosts have souls, Shakespeare would definitely be amazed by the scenes projected on the screen! For someone who lived in an era when stage backgrounds and photography techniques had not yet been invented, just seeing actors active on a stage with gorgeous forest and splendid palace backgrounds would already seem like watching magic. Now, wouldn't these novel film techniques be even more astonishing to him?</p>
<p>This fantasy story has been performed countless times on stages around the world. In the earliest days, it was on a simple and innocent stage, without backgrounds, and the scenes in the play had to be imagined by the audience themselves. Later, stage backgrounds were invented, but even the largest stages and the best designs are ultimately overshadowed by Reinhardt's screen version of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."</p>
<p>You see, in this film, the forest seems to have no end, unlike the stage where there is a backdrop to limit it. There are also a hundred fairies dancing in the moonlight; human heads are exchanged with donkey heads; Oberon brings his many large bats into the forest, looking like real bats. All of this can only be achieved with film technology.</p>
<p>In short, Warner Brothers, after more than two years of time, spending 1.5 million gold yuan, and exhausting the efforts of thousands of people, actually realized Shakespeare's dream on the screen. The film will soon be shown at the Guotai Cinema. If you want to experience the dreamlike scenes in the film, please wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Xu Lai in "Boatman's Daughter" <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Su Shi said, "It is a pity that Jia Yi was the assistant of a king, but he could not use his talent himself."</p>
<p>Every time I think of these words, I feel deeply moved. I don't believe that anyone is absolutely without talent, even the most ordinary person must have their use. The question is how to discover their talent, how to develop their talent. As long as they can be used according to their ability, it is not difficult to achieve amazing results.</p>
<p>People often say, "Xu Lai is not good at acting." But who can still make such a cold assessment of Xu Lai in "Boatman's Daughter"? When she was a model, she originally wanted to cry, but the young masters insisted that she smile; her expression and movements at that time still seem to be before my eyes. The scene in the brothel upstairs and the final reunion of father and daughter are both worthy of the audience's praise.</p>
<p>How did Xu Lai suddenly achieve such success in "Boatman's Daughter"? I believe that this must be attributed to the director, Mr. Lu Xiling. Whether an actor can succeed is certainly related to their own talent, but if there is no director to discover their talent and develop their talent, even with extraordinary abilities, I am afraid there is a risk of being buried.</p>
