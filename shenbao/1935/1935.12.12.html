<p>時評</p>
<h3>倫敦海軍會議開幕</h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>五國海軍會議九日已在倫敦開幕。會期須六星期始畢。英國於險惡環境之中。召開此項會議。誠如鮑爾溫首相所謂。欲「繼續列屆會議之工作。盡人事以免再蹈漫無限制之海軍競爭之覆轍。」然自一九三一年來。四年短時期間。太平洋與地中海一帶。驚風駭濤。相逼加至。近則大局變幻。前途益難究詰。均勢旣無從恢復。集體保安又在胚胎時期。海軍會議之仍將如其他國際會議。難望多大成就。不待智者而喻矣。</p>
<p>各國在本屆會議所抱定之方針。可於各代表開幕演說中窺見一斑。美國政策。與十四月前預備會議時無異。卽於華盛頓及倫敦條約下。謀總額位之裁减。實際上卽堅持五·五·三之比率制。日本以「確保谷國國防之安固」爲名。謀「大海軍國間决定不得超過其保有量之共同限度。而確立不威脅不侵略之事態。」質言之。卽要求與英美平等。英國周旋於二者之間。其政策較有伸縮性。卽維持華盛頓與倫敦兩約之原則。而加以調整。以迎合國際之變局與各國之需要。其意卽爲不必堅持比率制。而就質與量方面。作個別之解决。法代表視量的方面較質的方面爲複雜。意方則僅消極的不主張成立悠久之嚴格辦法。至於英屬地代表大都贊成延續兩約原則。會議之前據聞各國並無接洽。今次宣布態度。又多無變更則此種僵局有何打開之策乎。</p>
<p>日本要求平等爲會議之癥結。亦爲英美日折衝上之原則問題。英美如在外交上不憎作此讓步。則無異自絕於遠東國際之列。政蓋治問題。未必能提及。卽提及亦未必有解决之策。而關係國代表不能不默認彼此有此心事。况日本所謂「不侵略不威脅」者。無非發揮其大陸主義中鞏固後方之政策耳。故卽承認日之平等要求。亦難挽回海軍競爭之趨勢。前華盛頓及倫敦兩約之成就。僅及於維持原狀下海軍暫行休戰之一點。日本一時怵於英美之優勢。似稍歛跡。實則乘機擴充軍備。不遺餘力。今羽毛未滿。卽有獨覇東亞以抗英美之雄心。則海軍問題根本上已積重難返。其足以限制軍備者。惟視財力之能否勝任耳。</p>
<p>然本屆會議或亦不致完全失敗。就現勢論。央美前次所主張之廢止潛艦問題。在日本則以潛艦爲其已與英美獲臻平等之軍備。在戰略上之效用。與空軍相捋。足以威脅海上自由或衝破海軍封鎖。在法國則以爲其保持對意優勢之利器。完全廢止在今雖似尙無希望。惟限制其戰時之橫行無忌。如倫敦條約二十條所規定者。可望賡續。去年六月間英德海軍恊定成立後。二國代表曾有類此宣言。可知歐洲方面此項問題之討論已少一重障碍。此點如獲通過。於人道主義。可謂一種進步。然於大局本身仍無多大影響也。</p>

<h3>美國停止購銀　倫敦銀市停頓　拋出達二千萬盎斯　銀價慘跌無法標價　最近形勢聞已稍佳</h3>
<p>（倫敦）世界銀價慘跌之結果、已使倫敦白銀經紀人今日暫停交易一日、拋售者較之平常之數多至七倍、大部來自東方、因信美國已變更其購銀政策、市塲拋售之銀達一千八百萬盎斯至二千萬盎斯之鉅、竟無人問津、銀價因未掛牌、此爲一九一四年歐戰以來之第一次、銀價初原擬展期至下午四時十五分掛牌、嗣以無人買進、致使交易暫行停止、惟明日當可略見分曉云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）此間因受倫敦銀市停頓之影響、今日銀價掛牌延遲甚久、最後始定爲每盎斯六角三分又四分之三、較昨日跌一分、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦銀市在昨日擾攘之後、今日已恐惶較减、遠東與印度投機家鑒於最近已發展、當然頗感困難、故今日售出之數、已不似昨日之多、許多委託者皆限價賈出、銀市中人現抱現貨價格當可掛牌之希望、至於遠期則一時恐難結價也、衆料現貨若能結價、則在二十八便士左右、美國態度迄未明瞭、同時國外匯兌現感銀市風潮之反響、英鎊以美元及金鎊折合、價較疲弱、因恐美國如不照舊收買現銀、則美元將戚缺乏也、金因幣美元價漲而受益、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國未委託購進、故今日銀市不能掛牌定價、此爲倫敦銀市前所未有之事、致市况完全紊亂、向來午後二時左右經紀人根據所有之賣出與買進、决定價格、但今日經紀人照常集合時、則見祇有賣出、而無買進之委託、於是决定暫停交易、希望美財部復入市塲、而有儘量吸收賣出之委託、但在交易複作時、美財部僅準備以比昨日更低之價格購入少數白銀、較諸賣出總額祇及七分之一耳、照交易所規程、所有賣出之數、必須照結定價格完全吸收、經紀人因此不得已唯有不能結價而已、聞美國願購進二百萬盎斯、價爲二十八便士三七五、比昨低三七五、而經紀人所接到賣出現銀之委託單、則達五百萬盎斯、據銀市外可恃消息、出賈之數、大都爲遠期、約達一千二百萬盎斯、而欲購遠期者，則甚少也（十日路透）</p>
<h3>美財部之聲明　否認背棄購銀法</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美財長摩甘索之發言人今日批評倫敦銀市之崩潰、否認美財部背棄購銀法條文之說、摩甘索刻不在華盛頓、但銀市情形則已詳告之矣、據倫敦經紀人之意見、銀市之崩潰、由於美國之不購進、美財長之發言人聲稱、美當局屢次聲明忠實履行購銀法條文、但有不可忘者、財長前曾說明美財部貨幣政策、係以二十四小時爲根據云、官塲未有任何明晰言論、故美財部置身於世界銀市之外、將有若干時期、殊無人能言之也、國務院人員不願批評美政府購銀與中日時局有關之說、國會銀派議員自稱、未得關於大局之消息、但覺財部之行爲、並不表示美國白銀政策之永遠變更、目前形勢、不過暫時性質耳、有人建議財長應特別召集新聞記者、說明白銀局勢、財部次長甘斯頓答稱、如爲討論白銀局勢而召集新聞記者、則實無須召集、財部現仍履行購銀法條文、不欲逐日討論世界銀市之發展、或美國所須採行以應付此局勢之方略云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財部官員今日仍不願批評白銀問題、財長毛根韜今晨並未到部視事、但財部中人宣稱、關於世界銀市、財長所得情報甚爲靈通云、財長旋到部、但不願與新聞記者討論白銀政策、惟財部發言人宣稱、吾人現仍實行購銀法、但不欲討論該計劃之內容及其現狀、華盛頓方面對於美國購銀計劃與目前世界市塲之關係、紛起推測、美國昨日自倫敦撤回購銀定單、倫敦市塲今日因之完全停頓、此間盛傳財部立塲如下、（一）財部直接與中國談判購買中國存銀、（二）財長决定以極大壓力加諸倫敦、藉此懲戒投機家、（三）財部聞大批白銀由中國偷運日本、因停止向世界市塲購買白銀、官方得悉十一月份自中國流往日本之白銀較一九三四年十一月增加三倍、據稱財部事前曾允對中國設法改善購銀辦法、務使中國所受之損害减至最小限度、（四）中國出售白銀、俾增加美元及英鎊之國外存欵、用以穩定幣價、但拋售之數、超出美國吸收之能力、（五）歐洲戰機漸消、美國不能繼續購銀而不引起英鎊意外之飛漲、職是之故、財部驟然終止購銀、此間消息靈通之金融視察則認此說最爲可靠、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>我國幣制影響</p>
<p>（紐約）今日此間若干方面認美財部停止購銀之舉動、乃中國幣制改革之結果、以爲倫敦銀市所遇之窘境、乃中國在倫敦大批售出白銀、以期獲得國外匯兌、安定其幣價所致、美政府當前難題、爲美國應否提高銀價、以利於南京與香港政府之問題、參議員湯姆士今日在華盛頓發表關於此事之言論、按湯氏乃白銀購買案中主動人物之一、渠今日對客發表談片、謂目前銀市局勢、乃英國欲握世界大權、將中國貨幣與英鎊聯接、而不利於美國之結果、英國遣羅斯爵士前往中國、羅斯勸告南京、以爲中國採行與英鎊聯接之管理的通貨制度、而賣出白銀、購入黃金、實爲上策、湯氏又稱、彼等吮吸吾人、爲時已久、今揭開其內幕、殊與銀市及美國有益、故美國之停止購銀、確爲正當辦法、吾人何必帮助英國、以解决中國難題、致有益於英國、有損於美國乎、從世界貨幣將來安定之立塲言、銀市之崩潰、乃極佳事也云、紐約銀市無人購進、今日外銀價格不能及早制定、但最後結價爲六角三分七五、跌去一分、今日證券開盤頗形參差、因白銀局勢使人恐慌也、後各種證券價皆疲弱、尤以五金股票與路股爲甚、今日證券成交數爲二百三十四萬一股、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦報紙觀測</p>
<p>（倫敦）財政新聞報撰文評論銀市混亂狀况、謂「銀市混亂、究因何故、現尙無從推測、則以美國政府對於所懷意向、毫未有所洩露故也、惟白銀政策推行已至目前階段不論其在實際上如何無效、若謂美國政府竟擬全部放棄、未免使人難信也、美國政府曾以爲提高銀價可以恢復遠東民族之購買力、其所料完全非確、此在中國頒布新貨幣政策廢止銀幣以前、當早已證明矣」、該報結論提出問題謂、」今茲美國步驟、是爲求達往昔同一目的之步驟乎、抑白銀政策全部觀念之謬誤、而鼓吹此項政策者、原來見解爲誤入歧途、已爲羅斯總統所開始覺察歟」云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>香港未受影響</p>
<p>（香港）據可恃方面估計、香港財務處庫存白銀現達八千五百萬元、因發鈔銀行已將準備現銀悉數送交財務處也、所有現銀悉爲銀幣、至於大條、則爲數甚少、今晨除投機家購進美元五十五萬元外、世界白銀局勢並無多大影響及於香港市塲、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據本社訪員探悉、昨日英國外務次官汪西泰爵士、曾於英國內閣會議之後、深夜拜訪賴伐爾總理舉行談話、所討論者、以關於英法共同提議之內容方面爲少、而偏重於此項提議對於制裁政策之影響、易詞言之、卽英法提議若爲意相墨索里尼所接受而爲阿國皇帝所拒絕、則媒油禁運辦法應否對意實施是也、一般人相信、英國內閣以爲意阿爭端解决辦法、旣須爲國聯會所接受、又當由兩當事國同予贊成、故阿國一旦拒絕英法提議、則媒油禁運辦法、仍當實施、此在賴伐爾總理、則亟欲避免意國因實施媒油禁運而生反響、故主張阿國皇帝若拒絕央法提議、卽應負和平談判失敗之一部分責任、因此制裁措置、自未便加嚴云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>任何建議獎勵侵略　阿政府萬難接受　寗願抗戰不甘割地乞和　英法方案提交兩當事國　國聯制裁委會今日集議</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據可靠消息、阿比西尼亞政府頃照會外務部、謂「任何解决爭端方案之足以獎勵侵略國者、阿國政府認爲無從接受、」照會嗣又申說阿國所以直至最後一分鐘始下動員令、而作戰事準備者、係因英國政府申請之故、阿國現寗願奮鬥到底、决不接受此種解决方案」云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿京　國皇聞悉英法兩國外交當局所擬之意阿爭端解决方案後、當卽表示、苟欲以尺士寸地割讓侵略國、阿國必當加以反對云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）墨索里尼對於英法和解方案、聞將於今夜發出覆文、表示相當之贊同、英法方案已由法大使香布倫及英大使德魯蒙先後提交墨索里尼首相、於是羅馬方面數月來之陰霾、今日陡見曙光矣、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日此間徵實英法由外交途徑討論修正英外相與法總理賴伐爾在巴黎商妥之和平方案後、英政府對於和平條件、已表示滿意、英外交次官樊西太特今日偕巴黎英大使克勒克至法外交部討論該方案、當離部之時、新聞訪員趨前探詢、樊氏答曰、吾人已獲妥協矣、</p>
<p>修正之和平條件、已於昨夜電達羅馬與阿狄斯阿巴巴（阿京）、衆信英政府曾請法政府明白宣布此項建議、當然須由意國接受、而亦須由阿國與國聯接受、後遂獲英政府所滿意之妥協、接法方消息、雙方所商妥之修正、爲將割讓與意國之蒂格里省土地大加削减、議供意國移民居住之士地內意國所享之權利、亦經修正、該地仍在阿王主權之下、聞英政府對原定之條件、指爲過厚於意國、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據本社訪員所知、內閣所主張霍爾賴伐爾共同建議應予修改各點、關係並不重要、按照內閣所擬新案、（一）蒂格里省領土割讓意國之部份、面積較原案爲小、除阿克森「聖城」以外、阿狄格拉區、亦將由阿國繼續保有、（二）阿國南部所擬准許意國殖民之地帶、應由意國公司經營、此項公司、應由阿國皇帝特許組織、而由國聯會代表加以監督、此外又據本社所知、內閣主張阿國領土修改、（卽蒂格里省割讓意國、而阿國在紅海沿岸取得通海之口）務當具有領土交換之性質、庶幾英國得免獎勵侵略國之嫌云、外務部人士相信、意相墨索里尼將接受英法所擬方案、惟阿國政府則必加以拒絕、觀於今晚該國政府致外務部之照會、卽可明見矣、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>和解修正案　英法完全妥恊　正式提交兩當事國</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法總理兼外長輯伐爾今日宣布、英法調解意阿紛爭方案、已於今日提交意阿兩國玫府、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦與巴黎方面以電話作最格之接洽後、英國內閣已於今夜核准英法和解意阿紛爭方案、據稱主要之癥結在於手續問題、英國主將該案先提交國聯、然後通知意阿兩國、卒爲賴伐爾所打銷、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>艾登賴伐爾　同車赴日內瓦　制裁委員今日開會</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯制裁委員會將於明日照定期開會、聞法國主張展緩、英國不以爲然、衆料明日會議中將討論英法和平建議、但關於此案之切實决議、爲期尙遠該方案大約將移交制裁調整委員會或下星期二日國聯行政院會議討論、艾登定明日啟程取道巴黎來日內瓦、關於對意油禁之建議、蘇俄羅馬尼亞荷蘭暹羅芬蘭伊拉克印度紐絲綸阿眞廷迄今尙未答覆、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）總理兼外長賴伐爾與英國外相霍爾、雖已商定意阿爭端解决方案、但國聯會究將採取何種程序歟、此一問題、目下猶未解决、賴伐爾今晚將與英國不管部大臣艾登同車前往日內瓦、二人當在車次、就此問題加以商談、同時國聯會行政院五國委員會主席西班牙代表瑪達利亞加、亦乘是車、是則賴伐爾與艾登、自亦將與瑪達利亞加有所接洽也、一般人頂料、十八國小組委員會將以英法兩國正在進行調解爲理由、而延緩討論煤油禁運問題、並當在國聯會主持之下、以英法兩國在巴黎所商定之方案爲基礎、由關係各國進行談判、至行政院五國委員會、原爲擔任調解之機構、由西班牙代表瑪達利亞加及英法波蘭土耳其四國代表組成、前以該委員會在九月十八日所提出之建議、未爲意國所接受、致停頓至今、現則自當賡續工作、以竟全功也、此外參加制裁各國、因實施制裁辦法、無不戚受痛苦、及至上述談判開始舉行之際、自戚束縛有减輕之望、喘息可爲之一舒、惟欲各該國與意國恢復正常關係、則必須英法兩國建議爲意阿兩國所接受而後可也、總之、英法兩國此次所商定之建議、足以表示兩國業已以最大努力、從事於意阿爭端之調解工作、其對意讓步、旣已達至最方限度、其在政治上之可能性、亦蔑以復加矣、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>犧牲弱小造成和局　不啻國聯一喪鐘　蘇聯報之譏評</h3>

<h3>日本立塲持之成理</h3>
<p>（倫敦）日本軍縮會議代表部昨日開會、協議十一日軍縮第一次委員會時、日本主張之說明方針、結果决定如下、（一）軍備平等權、日本之要求設定共通最大限度、由國家之體面言之、亦係當然之事、但不僅因拘泥體面而提出、實以樹立國防策之必要爲基礎、而提出切實之要求、因此僅由名義上承認平等權、實際將保有量减低之提案、是所絕對反對、此點鑒於外國間有宣傳要求平等權、乃僅係體面問題之說、故特極力主張（一）要求平等權之理由、如展次所聲明、目標在確立理想軍縮不威脅不侵略之原則、在眞不欲引起世界發生戰事者、當能自明此理、海軍力乃自由移動、而不威脅不侵略、要惟以平等權爲基礎（一）列國若承認日本主張、準備提出共通最大限度兵力量之數字提案、其水準務求低下、並决將此次會議務使其成爲軍縮史上劃期的會議、（一）英美日與法意立塲自各不同、日本代表以高度軍備之大削减、爲最大之關心事、（一）在實現共通最大限度前之過渡時期、若爲長期、則結果乃容許其間維持比率、因此日本不能贊成攻擊武器之廢棄或大削减、務必於短期內行之、至討議數字、屬於會議之公斷事項、例如其期爲十年或十五年、實失諸過長、（十一日電通電）</p>

<h3>菲島獨立幻夢急遽消滅　美名記者霍特華發表一文</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據霍華特報系及美國聯合新聞社董專長霍華特之意見、菲律賓羣島於一九四六年自治政府期滿之後、以自前菲人本身之態度觀之、當不致完全獨立、震氏現在馬尼刺、今日發表一文、聲稱、菲人之獨立幻夢、已迅速消滅、</p>
<p>獨立問題爲菲島政界中三十五年來最大之爭點、然於自治政府成立之後、不及一月、卽已入於山窮水盡之境、而獨立法所規定及政治領袖所要求之菲律賓共和國、隨處可見永無實現之勢、</p>
<p>日本軍隊向外擴展、志在捲有遠東全部、其黑影今日已籠罩全菲、是故菲人在政治上最大之目標、已由獨立轉移至謀使已經取得之自由、得以安全、此項安全之價値、已驟然增加、故第一步將在美國國旗之下求之、菲人不欲日本之「亞洲門羅主義」、因日本此語、無異爲「日本人之亞洲」而已、</p>
<p>霍氏以爲如情形不變、則，不數年間、美國國會卽將「被請以自治政府成爲永久制度、且以屬地資格確定其政治及經濟地位、同時菲人亦巳着手擬向美國政商各界宣傳菲島之商業潛力、一俟政治地位確定、菲美能自由貿易、經濟上之互惠利益得有保障、其前途當更無限量、</p>
<p>美國工人現在之反菲態度、可以嚴格之移民律解除之、國會中若恐菲人參加之後、將有紛擾、則儘可事前規定、不得改爲州制、倘此項宣傳、仍未能引起美國人之興趣、則菲島商界領袖率直聲稱、彼等將要求自治政府與英國接洽、願爲英國屬地云、英國對於此議、當然歡迎、因菲島在經濟上旣大可發展、在地勢上亦能增强英國在遠東之地位、倘不幸而落入敵國手中、卽將危及英國在華之全部地位云、</p>
<p>以上霍氏所述之情形、係彼一月以來游歷全島與各界領袖人士談話時所搜集之意見、至於一般民衆、則霍氏云、對於各方情勢、猶不能明瞭、彼等但知獨立之後、卽能一除積痼、現在實際上幾已達到獨立之目的、</p>
<p>故對於目前之領袖、信仰殊深、然領導民衆思想、深受敎育之人士、則除若干政界人士以外、大率承認菲島如不能經濟獨立、及缺乏適當之國防、卽無政治獨立可言、卽大半政界人士、亦承認以單獨菲島力量、不能使經濟及國防獨立、惟彼等囿於地位關係，不能公然表示耳、</p>
<p>菲人以爲彼等之改變宗旨、與其他在太平洋中有關國家之政策、實不背謬、自日本違抗國聯、侵略亞洲大陸以來、各國之遠東政策、皆已改變、向來華盛頓與馬尼刺考慮獨立問題之時、輒以爲政治獨立及領土完整、皆有條約可以保障、茲以中國之情形觀之、已證明此種保隊、在遠東毫無價値、故美菲雙方驚奇之餘、菲人亦以爲改變宗旨、並非違背信義矣、且菲人以爲放棄獨立、實爲菲人不能控制之勢力所造成、因菲島如未得確切之保障、决不願美國退出也、目前美國方面、對於菲島之一切富源及商業機會、殊少瞭解、且亦不願在海外多有糾紛、故菲人惟有希望美國旣以獨立給予菲人、卽勿僅以獨立之名、强使菲人接受、並希望美國今日之國家主義、僅爲不景氣所引起之暫時的保守主義、將來一俟景氣恢復、美國商業重新向外發展、當仍將保留美國之市塲、而菲島亦不致彼視爲例外云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>奎松決統書面答覆</p>
<p>（巴尼剌）奎松總統今日書面答覆霍華特之報告、宣稱彼已宣誓遵守菲律濱憲法、該憲法曾規定一九四六年菲島獨立、無論如何、吾人締造國家責任分白、卽於極短之時期中、力使吾以於各方面均能自立自給是也（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>美陸軍當局之注意</p>
<p>（華盛頓）陸軍部當局今日對於霍華特氏關於菲律濱獨立之意見、聲稱任何舉動足使菲島附屬美國者、必須先經國會通過、陸部對於霍氏之意見、非常注意、惟因並未接到官方通知、不能直接批評、惟謂霍氏所述各節、實爲對於菲島問題創見之明確報告云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>國會議員表示意見</p>
<p>國會議員方面、大致以爲菲人之永久屬美運動、將引起經濟問題、結果如何頗難預料、大槪糖植物油牛奶等業、將繼續要求完全脫離、而紡織汽車機器等製造工業、將贊成聯屬、觀察者稱、以地理論、農業分佈全國、在國會中代表農村之議員向能勝利云、參議員泰定斯宣稱、如謂國會及美國人民贊成維持菲律濱現狀者、余甚疑之、美國允許獨立已有三十五年於茲、菲人要求完全獨立迄未稍間、去冬余專誠赴菲、目的卽在以獨立後之困難告知菲人、余因此事曾向彼等提出警告、茲復菲議會通過憲法、卒由美國批准、繼又舉行選舉、自治政府因以成立、關於霍華特報告中所陳之事實、泰氏稱余不信日本意圖菲律濱、菲人因决定彼等之需要云、美國總工會發言人稱、彼信多數菲人希望完全獨立、美國農會發言人亦稱、菲人業已接受獨立、農會將不與聞變更該政策之運動、參議員富蘭齊稱、菲人要求獨立、余覺應予承認、參加菲律濱自治政府成立典禮歸來之國會議員、當能决定將來國會對於菲律濱之態度也、參議員麥克賴稱、美國苟不能管理菲律濱之外交陸軍海軍空軍關稅移民及發行國債、則余不贊成永久自治制、余於訪問菲律濱後卽反對准予獨立、曾向參院報告此事、余深信獨立政府將不捍衛其國家、但美國如放棄全部財產及控制該島、則余覺不如完全退出之爲愈、如過渡時期後吾人如不宜控制菲政府重要部份、則不若令菲人自謀也、（十日國民電）</p>

<h3>財務處處長報吿　工部局財政狀況摘要</h3>
<p>房捐執照收入大見銷縮　預計本年盈餘約三十萬　各部撙節警務工務居首　來日艱難恐更甚於往昔</p>
<p>工部局財務委員會、日前曾舉行會議、討論本年前九月、以九月終爲止、工部局各部份之賬目、當時工部局財務處處長、對於該局財政狀况、曾作一口頭之陳述、現該委員會會議之紀錄、已於昨日工部局舉行例會時、加以批閱、茲復將該委員會會議討論情形、節錄如下、</p>
<p>工部局財務處處長、於其呈交財務委員會之報告書中、曾聲明工部局各部賬目雖已繕呈、但有因與總結之摘要有關、而必須加以指陳者如普通預算項下、結至本年九月終爲止、尙有盈餘一百八十二萬三千五百三十三元、而預計全年之盈餘、則爲三萬五千八百十元、惟此項數目、非至本財政年度終了之時、不足以表示財政之實在狀况、其原因如收入項下、地稅之全年數目、已經全部列入、而在他方面、則公共及市政事業項下、各種公用事業之報效費、因其係半年一結之故、秋季數目、尙未載入、此外經常收入項下、市政總捎及界外特捐、本年前九月數額、較諸預計、缺少約五十六萬三千元之譜、其原因約爲、（一）新建築較往年爲少、（二）房租之低减、（三）空屋之增多、而碼頭捐及執照捐二項收入、亦俱見短缺、但當可引以爲滿意者、即以上所述短缺之數、巳由各部份支出上撙節有方、足以抵消而有餘云、</p>
<p>財務處處長繼復承主席之請、對於其具呈之報告書、更作詳盡之口頭陳述、彼稱、本年前九月財政報告彙編之用意、係在以本年前九月已經確定之支出、通告各部份及其連屬之各委員會、俾得在本財政年度剩餘之數月中於支出上更爲審愼、冉則一年經營之結果如何、亦可於此預覘之云、關於市政收入方面者、本市因受普遍經濟凋敝之影響、損失極鉅、舉凡房捐執照費及其他收入之來源、俱如上文所云、較諸預期者相距甚遠、惟關於空屋之增多、汲新建築之减少二項、較諸以往、似有開始轉機之兆、據彼之所估計、本年各項來源之總收入、較之去年所預算者、約須短少一百二十五萬元云、</p>
<p>至於經常支出項下、據財務處處長之所陳、一九三四年度、因緊縮之故、各部費用、較之預算减省約一百十萬元、但本年度各部緊縮撙節、較之去年、實有過之而無不及、故依各部彙編之統計觀之、節省之數、約及一百六十萬元之譜、惟電話特別委員會之費用、約九萬三千元、則不在其內、此種節省、其最大之來源、爲警務及工務二處、當然、其他各部撙節所餘、亦不在少數也、在警務方面、外籍人員及監獄人員、較諸定額不足四十四人、該處其他部份、亦有同等之緊縮、他處亦有多少相同之處、至於工務方面、其節省之總數、僅亞於警務處惟該處厲行緊縮之時機、實較他處爲多、即如工程浩大之道路修築及改進、及其他活動、儘可暫時擱置、而其他各部、苟欲切實减縮、勢非由裁員入手不可也、財務處處長復稱、關於此等緊縮事項、工務警務二處處長、及其他各部汾之主任、均曾與以十二分之合作云、</p>
<p>財務處處長謂、關於本年經常預算想象之結果、其最要之處、即為設法使有盈餘、依彼之所預計、除去相當保留之外、本年盈餘、約在三十萬元之譜、以去年而論、項計之盈餘為三十六萬、而實在盈餘之數、則在七十萬左右、更以本年年內種種空前未有之困難言之、倘果能得此結果、則可謂爲差强人意矣、</p>
<p>再則關於一九三六年之預算、倘本年而有盈餘、滾存翌年預算、即將受實質上之影響、據財務處處長之所見、來日之艱難、恐將遠過前此數年之所經麼者、倘市政捐稅、更以現行百分之十四繼續行之、則初步之缺額、將達三百五十萬元之鉅、本年之經常預算、巳較去年减削多多、而來年之預算、勢必較本年尤爲緊縮、惟此與事功有關、倘長此繼續緊縮而不巳、最後之結果、即爲效能之遞减、與社會安適之剝除是矣、再則、本年預計中之盈餘、係指動用準備金中之撥欵後而言者、而上文所云、一九三六年度之初步缺額三百五十萬、則係指未動用準備之前而言者、他日動用準備後、所缺之數、自必因之而縮小也、當財務委員會討論之中、委員中有提及工部局外籟職員之滙兌補償金者、財務處處長、對於該項補償金計算及處理之方式、亦會有所陳述、</p>
<p>更以臨時收入支出賬目而論、財務處處長稱、在本年開始之時、各部份主張之建設費用、已减削至最低之限度、即在納稅人年會席上、主席亦曾指示、本年預算之建設費用、較之去年已大爲低减、工程之已在進行之中、不得不加以完成者、及道路修築之不得不履行者、幾佔預算之全部、但預算雖巳核减至最低之程度、而因工務處處長竭力合作之故、該處實在支出、較之預算、猶能銳意撙節、約略計之、約可達一百五十萬元之譜、各項工事之停頓、固在意中、惟鑒於本年財政上之困難、此舉之有利、當亦不可忽視也、</p>
<p>至各項建設費用之來源、發行市政公債、旣屬勢所不能、遂不得不於暫時金鎊賬上略增其透支、並以善價變賣若干資產、此項費用、始得應付裕如、再則一九三三年上海電話公司債欵、抵押條件、亦甚屬有利、蓋該公司在本年六月終、巳分期付還一百萬元、至本年年終、渡將有同等數目之償付也、</p>
<p>關乎工部局債務方面、財務處處長所言者、即一九二五年及一九二六年之市政六厘公債、財務處處長稱、彼於本年開始、曾受董事會之命令、與債權人保管委員會商妥、一九二五年債欵之發還、因期限尙有二十年、故暫從緩、蓋以目前狀况而論、此二種債欵、若欲依保管契約上所規定最初償還之期、、即本年及翌年十二月三十一日賞付之、俱屬無益、再則保管契約、前比亦已修正、償付債券之基金運用權、屬於局方、而不利益起見、應有五年猶預之期、而無須立即存貯現金、以待不可必之需要、惟此種辦法於債權人之利益、並無妨碍、因該項債券、自逾第一次可擇之償付期後、隨時可以六個月之通告收回之、而究於何時收回、則須視金融及債券市塲之狀况、於局方是否有利爲定、惟欲在一確定之日期、變賣其資產、以償付此項債務、實屬不合機宜之動作、而此後如何、悉須視將來之財政狀况爲定、若以彼與保管委員會所商定之辦法而論、則償債基金、應再　續五年、俾劃定償債之基金總數、能達五百萬元之譜、惟如上文所云、債權人之利益、絕不至受其影響於局方任擇收回日期之權利、亦無衝突之處、因此彼與保管委員會商定之辦法、應請委員會授權批准之、</p>
<p>各委對於此舉、表示同意、</p>
<p>主席後復論及工部局人員各項津貼問題、並謂、應請財務處處長、對於此事、在本年年終將現行緊縮與將來方針、加以報告、財務處處長稱、該事項巳經詳盡之探討、結果如何、彼當於日後另行報告之、惟據彼之意見、此事至爲複雜、經濟與公平、雙方均須顧及、而現行合同服務人員滿足及效能、亦悉有密切之關係也、</p>

<h3>改良中國樂器的問題（二）</h3>
<p>— 丁爕林</p>
<p>其次、凡是研究過西洋晝的人、多半更能欣賞中國畫、凡是研究過西洋戲劇的人、也多半更能欣賞中國的戲劇、就假定音樂是一個例外、凡是研究過西洋音樂的人、即不能再欣賞中國單調的音樂、然而中國音樂的單調、能歸罪於中國的樂器嗎、尤其是中國現有的未曾利用近代科學知識加以改良過的樂器、再說、受過西洋音樂敎育的人、究竟祇有極少數的知識分子、一般民衆所能欣賞、所能演奏的、祇是中國的音樂、所能購買、所能大家玩玩的、也祇是中國的樂器、店舖中的伙計、結束了一日買賣、工人農夫、作完了一日的苦工、行人道勞、或樹蔭之下、吹一曲洞蕭、或拉一段胡琴、這是極普通的現象、是値得羨慕、値得鼓勵的現象、在不能勸他們放棄了手中、香律不準的竹管或雜聲刺耳的竹桶換一張意大利提零玩玩的情境之下、我們祗有來替他改良他們手中現有的樂器、並且希望樂器經過改良之後、玩得普遍一點的一法、復次、有些人覺得多數的中國樂器、音量太小小、一個人獨奏獨聽、或一個人奏奏幾個人聽聽則可、拿到大音樂廳中、或和其他的樂器伴奏、即完全不成、中國短少發音宏量的樂器、確是一個很大缺點、一部分的中國樂器的音量、也許無法增大、也許不應增大、但是音量低微的本身、未必定是一個缺點、關於音量有兩方面、一方面是屬於音樂本身的、有的樂曲、應用强烈的音、有的樂曲、也應用柔弱的音、音量低微的樂器、當然也是應有的一格、另一方面是屬於聲音傳達的問題、要上千的人在一個廣大的音樂廳裏聽古琴獨奏、似乎是絕望的事、然而果眞絕望嗎、建築音學極端進步之後、又誰能斷定、即是中國古琴獨奏、不能從在幾十人前剛低到聽不見」的聲音會變成在幾千人前剛聽得見的聲音、何况廣播學術發達之後、僅爲欣賞音樂計、也許根本即無擠入千百人中之必要、</p>
<p>以上所說、似乎處處是替中國樂器作辨設、絕對不是、我們所說的僅是抽象的「中國樂器一、並不是指現有的各種具體的中國樂器、購到現在一般人所製、一般人所用的樂器、在構造的原理上、可以說是缺點甚多、再以最普通的簫笛而論、更可以說不成其爲樂器、因爲它們缺點樂器的基本條件、即不能發出合乎香理的昔律、我們不能贊同極端崇拜中國固有文化一班人的見解、也就是因爲如此、現在讓我們再就這第二種見解來說、關於中國固有的音樂文化、與本文有關的有兩方面、第一是音律、中國一向是把音律與曆、和度量衡連在一起的、所以歷代都把它當做一種政洽制度學者也把它當做一種高深的專門的學問、研究和討論昔律的著述、恐怕要比較關於音樂其他方面的著述多得多、然而說來似乎奇怪、在中國固有的音樂文化中、除了歷史的價値之外、在求今後中國音樂進步的應用上、最無用處的、就是屬於音律一方面的國故、這個道理很容易了解、就是因爲音律已純粹的變成了科學、關於這一點、我們不妨多說一點、因爲現在還有不少的學者希望從廢紙堆裏找出寳貴的東西、我們對於音律智識的進化、可以分爲三個階段、最初全靠人的聽覺認識和諧的音律、從樂器上或任何的發音的物體上、求得和諧的音律的方法有兩種、一是用管、一是用弦、希臘在很早的時代就發現了用弦求律的方法、中國在更早的時代、就發現了用管求律的方法、而這兩種方法完全相同、統可以中國的舊名「三分損益法」名之、所謂三分損益法、就是把一根管子的長度、增加原長的三分之一、或减少原長的三分之一、則吹出來的新音、都能與原音和諧、如果從一尺長的管子起頭、、依照此法、繼續的增减下去、我們就可以得到若干長度不同的管、發出若干高低不同的音、這些音或律就是中國書上所稱的「黃鍾」、「大呂」等等、這是第一個階段、三分損一成的是二與三的比率、三分益一、成的是三與四的比率、為甚麼成簡單比率的弦長或管長才能發出和諧的音律、這是希臘大哲學家、Pythgoras所提出的問題、</p>

<h3>鐵城盃籃球賽今日　持志對同濟</h3>
<p>各隊注意比賽時間有更動　漢良已退出對江灣昨未賽</p>
<p>鐵城盃籃球賽、昨甲組中因有漢良對江灣之戰故觀衆校前熱鬧、惟漢良因故臨時退出、故未成賽、頗爲失望、昨僅賽乙組三塲、翔殷勝幽默得來甚易輔誼對鐵輪、勢力平均、競爭較烈、最後一塲海鯨對民立、海鯨爲浦東中學球隊、人材平均、民立非其敵手、上半時二十二對十、海鯨估先、下半時民立仍無進展、結果以四五對二十爲海鯨勝、今日甲組有同濟與持志之戰、實力平均競爭必劇烈、茲誌昨賽結果及今日秩字如下、</p>
<p>昨賽結果</p>

<h3>西靑籃球劇戰　海賊幸勝麥令</h3>
<p>三十三比二十八　最後五分鐘决勝負</p>
<p>海賊麥令同爲西人籃球隊之兩强、隊員身材旣高大、而攻守方策復相似、昨相遇於西靑籃球甲組賽中、由張國　任裁判、麥令始終占居上風、惜最後三分鐘為海賊連中六分、乃以二十八比三十三敗挫、</p>
<p>觀衆慕兩隊球　而至者都五百餘人、表演確出神人化、緊張異常、麥令傳擲投籃均較戰協與時進步、故西靑　强、至是亦僅能追彌耳、上半時始終相差一二分、結果麥令以十四比十三占優勢、男籃後續賽、海號會兩造平局、但麥令於十九比二十後、進攻愈猛、造成二十七比二十二、超過五分之多、海賊緊隨不捨、至二十七比二十八後、即由皮塞關與蘭娟報連中四球、更以五分取勝、可謂幸矣、</p>

<h3>小男兒（一二一）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>蜀夫人聽到這一隊人失散了，面上就顯出嚴重的神色，於是送拂朗騎着兎披去找回那幾個小人兒回來。等到晚餐旣畢，全家照常坐在淸凉的院子裏的時候，拂朗已騎着兎披疾馳歸來，渾身灰塵，面有臺惶之色。</p>
<p>他不過進大門甬道一半的時候便喊問道，『他們回來了沒有』？</p>
<p>『沒有』！說着，蜀夫人就從椅子裏跳了出來，神氣那麽張皇，人人都跳了起來，圍着拂朗去聽消息。</p>
<p>『我什麼地方都找不到他們』，他開始說道；可是話還未說完忽然一聲很響的『哈囉』使他們都仰頭看去，不到一瞬功夫他們已到了屋子旁邊了。</p>
<p>『南恩和羅勃在那裏』？蜀夫人喊道，一手抓住了愛彌，她的一副勁道竟使他以爲他的舅母忽然是發瘋了。</p>
<p>『我不知道，他們已和別的入回家來了，他們還沒有嗎』？他急速回答道。</p>
<p>『沒有，太腓和韜摩說他們和你們同走的』。</p>
<p>『他們並沒有，也沒有見他們。我們在也塘裏泅一下水，再從樹林裏回來的』，解客說道，他自是驚慌得很。</p>

<h3>紗花　投機集中於紗花　漲風重起</h3>
<p>紗市兎起鶻落、形勢又見上昇、近來標金公債起伏較微、一般投機商均投奔於紗花市塲、有此一批新的籌碼、以致市價愈難穩定、上落範圍更形擴大、乍升乍降、殊難捉摸、但同業吳某徐某邊某等一致傾向拋賣、金融界拖進之額、則始終不放、不過棉紗存底、又見增加、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉麥後市買怕了較活</h3>
<p>粉市上午開盤、各月份大致平靜、因洋麥報價、芝加哥好三角左右、坎拿大好四分、市塲人心、因美國與白銀减値收買、買賣雙方、不免均有顧慮、是以交易淸淡、上落甚微、較之前日收價、毫無出入、迨至下午開盤、因美國白銀政策、一無捉摸、且四周空氣、亦甚挺穩、收買氣稍活、近遠期即高一二分、至各廠進出甚少、仍屬觀望、此後之升沉關鍵、當以洋麥能定與否爲轉移、</p>

<p>麥市上午開盤、各月份異常平定、交易亦冷淡不堪、因洋麥報價回好二三角、惟美國之白銀政策、多頭不能確定、是以買賣兩寂、價祇好二三分、迨至下午開盤、交易依然不暢、後因粉市回挺、買氣亦較活絡、較之上午收價、又好三五分、觀目下情勢、全以國外形勢爲轉移、於國內供求、反若風馬之不關也、現麥市面因廠胃平平、各檔喊價小一分、開山東漯河麥四元八角一分、紹興麥四元五角九分、江北麥四元七角九分、淮安麥四元七角九分、揚州麥四元七角六分、臨淮關麥四元八角、由幅新去五千包、</p>

<h3>薄稻湧到續小角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源仍有五六十號、（貨共萬二三千石）、中以薄稻又夥、故際包胃轉稀、天津靑島等帮辦二千餘包、開價隊跌小數分至一角、而厚早等粳銷化雖屬未暢、然賴天雪、人心平穩、杜洋尖無甚榮辱、陰變元帶疲之勢、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船五十七八號、市上白粳去路零銷依然平淡、囤戶取巧續動、價又小數分、早稻跟小近角薄稻零胃有限、價小角外、羊尖埠尖店胃稍取、市價平定、白元定勢、其餘各貨價亦見疲軟、</p>
<h3>贛米出產激增</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不絕、長江路到貨源源不絕之象、江西今年增加收獲、出數更多、因收復區域內均告豐收、產額激增、故近日逐有抵埠、浙屬溫台亦有逐到、而客囤停頓、市形久居軟疲、昨日本街胃口尙活、市面尙能撑站、全日開出工西米四千包、溫台甬各米五百二十五包、漢口米二百包、均系本街辦去、暹邏米采亦開二百包、行情均與前市相似、</p>

<h3>針眉綠茶歐銷續暢</h3>

<p>肺病特刊</p>
<p>P&gt;肺病臟器療法之實騐談</p>
<p>— 沈香伯醫師</p>
<p>近世治療內服藥誠多矣。汗牛充梀。指不勝屈。但用諸臨床之實騐。其能收美滿效果者。則為鳳毛麟角。至於廣吿上所載之藥品。雖極力鼓吹其效能。實則全無實益。徒資遺害而已。有時雖可止咳。乃其所含之安神劑之力。並無根治功效。况從來肺病內服藥中之配劑。皆不外幾怪。鈣·燐·魚肝油等類。此種藥物。或僅獲效於一時。或祇適合於初期。或多服則敗胃。或久服不能中斷。要皆非治病根本良藥也。</p>
<p>近有「肺活」Phith　Weal者。餘認為肺癆病內服藥中之翹楚。在全世界。堪稱無二之療肺特效藥。據歐美學者之報吿。各國醫家之實騐。確認為現今肺病內服治療劑中之最安全最有效者。惟有「肺活」Phith　Weal因其所用材料。係由哺乳動物新鮮肺臟及脾臟中提出之荷爾蒙Hormone所製。對於肺臟病灶呈直接作用。塡補其缺損。調和保持其機能。同時在病灶之周圍。築成鞏固結締之牆壁。使之硬化。促成瘢痕之形成。完全包裹惡魔之結核菌。則令自滅。且此種肺脾臟之有效成分。更有促進血液之凝固力。故「肺活」Phith　Weal對於防止出血（咯血）之作用。功效尤為顯著。</p>
<p>「肺活」Phith　Weal以肺·脾·臟器之成分為主劑外。尚含有卵黃素（卽類脂質）Lecithin等滋養強壯藥品在內。故用後有能造血肥肌。使體力旺盛。挽回日漸消失之生活機能。增加天然抵抗疾病之能力。使患者速離病體。而於極短期間痊癒。古人云「良醫治末病」。凡患神經衰弱。體質虛損之人。最易發生癆症。如服用「肺活」Phith　Weal可使身體健康強壯。得增加抵抗傳染之勢力。故服用本劑者。得「有癆治癆」。「無癆增進健康預防肺癆」防治咸宜之功效。</p>
<p>余自得「肺活」Phith　Weal應用於臨床以來。治療各期肺癆症。不下數百餘例。均奏意想不到之效果。大率輕者一月。重者亦不過二三月卽愈。得心應手。藥到病除。確為肺病內服藥中之冠軍。茲將本藥應用之成績略述於左。</p>
<p>（一）用本藥後。共有效成分被吸收。包圍結核之病灶。而築成鞏固結締之牆壁。防止微生物之蔓延。且微生物因缺乏營養。而逐漸消滅。因之寒熱·咳嗽·咯血及一切病象均見迅速消退。</p>
<p>（二）連服數星期後。卽見面容紅潤。精神飽滿。不復如以前之萎靡不振矣。</p>
<p>（三）「肺活」Phith　Weal內所含成分除肺臟製劑外。尚有卵黃素。肝臟腺荷爾蒙。睪丸腺荷爾蒙等生精補血之珍品參合其中。故患者雖用「肺活」一種。但所得之效益則勝用藥劑數種。適合經濟。</p>
<p>（四）氣味甘美易服。雖婦孺亦樂於取用。頻頻服之。食慾自振。身體日健。「肺活」Phith　Weal為臟器製劑。其中絕不夾雜化學等有害物質。故雖常年服用。亦無絲亳流弊也。</p>
<p>夫「肺活」有如此美滿之成績。决非尋常療肺各藥所可望其項背。茲述數語。為海內病者吿。</p>
<h3>肺病漫談</h3>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>一肺病病人之危險</p>
<p>肺病病人之危險，常不在病—而在治療之方法，有一種病人，亳無醫藥常識，因欲求速效，遂誤信友人之勸吿—或誤信廣吿之宣傳，不加審察，卽遍購各種藥物。一一嘗試，殊不知治療肺病，需賴人身自然旺盛之機能，使結締組織增殖，包圍病灶，方能痊癒，若以為藥物能撲殺結核菌，則雜投廣吿上如此誇言之藥物，對於肺病，非但無益，有時且甚有害，至有生命危險，而延誤時日，枉費金錢，猶其為害之小焉者也，有時有人用此類藥物，亦復見效者，乃由於其人對於肺病之抵抗本強，雖不服藥，亦自然治愈，幷非藥物之效。</p>
<p>編者按。今日最確實有根據之肺病療法。惟有以人力之補助。促進其自然治愈之機能旺盛。此外更無確實方法。然病變久困吾人身體。則此等機能，往往發生阻害。馴致不能發展，此時吾人常根據此自然之妙機，而加以補助，此法者何，卽臟器療法是也，故近世結核治療界，一致採用「肺活」Phithweal（因本品乃哺乳動物肺臟與脾臟中抽出之荷爾蒙所製）施與結核病人。補充其機能，使之旺盛，促進結締增殖，包圍病灶，能使病變之作用，完全失其活動。終必使之完全停止，以至治愈，故「肺活」Phith　Weal之用於肺結核，為最合理最安全之內服聖劑也。</p>
<p>二肺病之性慾問題</p>
<p>肺病病人之性慾衝動，必較常人為烈，此種現象，幷非生理上之現象，乃為病菌毒素刺戟神經而生之一種中毒症狀，故肺病病人有此種衝動時，必當極力制止之。在肺病活動（進行）期間。更當完全禁慾，絕對不可行房事，絕慾者必常患遺精，亦能妨害治愈，故有遺精者，若內服「育麟固精片」Juvenilin　Tab，於臨睡前用兩一三片，卽可無憂。</p>
<p>三肺病需要蛋白質</p>
<p>蛋白質為人體組織的主要成分，為體力之源泉，肺結核患者，對於蛋白質之消耗特多，故不能不有以補充之，在有熱患者，體內蛋白質之分解更盛，一日約需蛋白質量90—100公分，卽體重一公斤。要1.5—2公分的蛋白質，由此觀之，肺病病人的營養療法，對於蛋白質之補充，更為重要。</p>
<p>吾人欲於普通食物中，求得蛋白質的相當補量。確是很難，因為蛋白質於人體，非消化到「阿米諾酸」Amino　Acid以後，不能吸收，然則肺病病人的胃腸必定薄弱，從食物中含有豐富的營養素——蛋白質，因為不易消化——而不能吸收，結果仍隨大便排出，亳無利益，故不得不於食物以外，另謀補給。</p>
<p>今有補血，滋養，強壯劑「康氏生活素」Conbour’sSan-Vita-Cell是蛋白質的最後消化產生物——「阿米諾酸」的製劑，換言之，便是經過人工消化蛋白質的精華，服用以後，無須消化器的消化，能直接吸收，滋養人體，卽刻製造血液，構成肌肉，同時促進新陳代謝，旺盛人體所有生活機能——以及精神體力，增加疾病之抵抗力，所以現今各國療養院，一致賞用。視為肺病治愈之補助的要藥，近來我又徵諸臨床實騐。也認為事理相符，卽凡經我勸服的肺病患者，莫不稱有功效。</p>
<p>四肺病與神經衰弱</p>
<p>肺病之療養期間，極為長久，患者在此療養期內，不免有種種希望，變成幻泡，其精神上所受打擊，本已極大，再加以世人之歧視，朋友之疎遠，家庭待遇之冷淡等。種種處于悲憤孤獨之環境，因此結核患者，倂發神經衰弱，蓋亦事所必然也。</p>
<p>精神為人之中央政府，身體各部之機能，皆受其支配命令，方能健全活動。</p>
<p>肺之一隅，有結核病時，當從事治療，第一必要者，卽為健康之精神作用，若一患神經衰弱。則夜不能眠，食慾减退，續發各種障礙，不但使病不易早愈，而且不免病勢增惡。</p>
<p>病者經時應改變其人生觀。抱空一切，修養身心，若注意攝生，內服「肺活」Phith　Weal與「康氏生活素」Conbour’sSan-Vita-Cell等藥。必治愈可期，無庸悲觀，徒自尋苦惱。</p>
<p>倘有頭痛，眩暈，失眠，精神憂鬱，神思恍惚等象，此係神經衰弱重症，除嚴守攝生外，宜服「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic或「還爾童」Well　Tonic等藥，編者曾用此法治愈多人，故認為肺病對症療法之要端也。</p>
<h3>靑年男女的憂鬱病</h3>
<p>— 陳一靑醫師</p>
<p>憂鬱病。大多是發於手淫—或房事過度的人。其他如月經不調—或是患神經衰弱的婦女。發生本症者也不少。</p>
<p>本病症狀。於身體方面。有頑固之睡眠不足，頭重眩暈，胸內苦悶，心悸不寗，全身倦怠，消化障礙，營養分泌機能减退，大便秘結等。精神方面。顏貌憂鬱狀態之存在，意識雖淸明—而有持續性苦悶。記憶减退，思想遲鈍，心氣忘想，幻覺善驚，起居不安，常有自殺—及危險行為。</p>
<p>本病療法。第一要命其安靜。服「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic極為特效。其他行水治法。及營養療法。如「康氏生活素」Conbour’San—Vita—Cell身體瘦弱者。用以滋養強壯。恢復更速。對於身體及精神上之剌戟。須絕對避免才好。在婦女如因月經不調—或神經衰弱者。除上列各種療法外。須服「美奴寗」Menorrin養血調經。方能根治。</p>
<h3>靑年人：一個可怕的漏巵——遺精</h3>
<p>— 陳一靑醫師</p>
<p>遺精，是在睡眠中不知覺地精液之排出：遺精回數，因各人的體質和生活狀態而不同；有一週兩三回的，有數週一回的；遺精種類，大槪分為病理的和生理的兩種；在一週以上的間隔，遺精的第二天，沒有疲憊的狀態，這就是生理的，不是病的。</p>
<p>所謂病的遺精，是指遺精的回數頻多，且發生疲勞，頭痛，耳鳴，心悸，四肢倦怠，腰背酸痛，精神憂鬱等症狀者而言，病理的遺精，非單在夜裏所常見，還有在白晝勃起，或為被褥和衣服的摩擦及壓迫，或因看了異性精液便會流出來的；這種遺精症，可說是最利害的，所以身體疲勞亦達於極點，什麼事也不想做了。</p>
<p>遺精的原因，雖有種種的，實在都是由手淫——性交過度，而弄成劇烈的神經衰弱，結果遂得着懊惱的遺精病症。</p>
<p>遺精的治療法，因為遺精幷不是特發症，是有誘發的別種原因的；所以治療必先要除去那個原因。如犯手淫及其他惡習的人們，只要飜然改悔，努力攝生，是不難恢復的，主要的攝生法，是；不要看淫穢的書畫，避免心身的過勞，禁用有剌戟性的食物，宜吃淸淡的物品，實行有規律的生活。</p>
<p>照我在臨床上的經騐。遇到患遺精的病家。一律給與「育麟固精片」Juvenilin　Tablets每夜於就寢前頓服三片。就可立止不遺。大都連服十日。卽能根治。若有性神經衰弱的病狀——陰萎——早洩——性慾减退——未老先衰等。須同時服生殖腺荷爾蒙聯合製劑「還爾童」Well　Tonic才能恢復閨房之樂。</p>
<p>不論如何劇烈的遺精——和性的神經衰弱症。照以上的治療方法。我可担保迅速地痊癒。</p>
<p>注意　近來市間所售之固精片一藥。種類甚多。但有效者甚少——而有流弊者甚多。病者服後——往往效未見而害已至。按鄙人實騐。美林登林藥行經理之「育麟固精片」Juvenlin　Tab最為安全有效。患者購時。幸留意焉。</p>
<h3>神經衰弱講坐</h3>
<p>— 姜冠羣醫師</p>
<p>靑年的危機！</p>
<p>由手淫而致的神經衰弱</p>
<p>普通所謂之神經衰弱，多以為身心過勞——勤勉過度——或波折異常之所致，然自凟（卽手淫）行為，實亦為神經衰弱底最大原因之一，下從貧民階級——上至上流社會底靑年，——其不曾經騐過此自凟行為者，恐如鳳毛麟角，幾無一人吧！自凟行為，甚足增加身體底衰弱，使精神力减退，神經素質者，於犯失眠症中，而無意識地犯自凟（手淫）行為者，大有人在，靑年人們，尚不自覺，自凟行為會那樣地使身體虛弱，然自凟行為底次數愈多，則肉體乃受影響——而精力大為减退——精神之受其影響，自亦不待言，且自凟行為底結果，將致神經顯著緊張，則致神經過敏，氣力衰退，精神乃常為亢奮，悲觀，憂鬱，自凟行為，使內心虛弱，同時，更致視力，知覺，判斷，記憶，想像力，亦為减退，國而，依自凟——手淫——行為而生的惡影響，多精神萎頹，形容憔悴，記憶薄弱，行動艱難，百病叢生。奄奄一息。纏綿床褥，雖生之日，猶死之年，卽使性命保存，茍延殘喘，而前程斷喪殆盡，雖有建拔，其影響如此重大，深可痛惜，靑年諸君，宜自禁這傷身底行為！</p>
<p>性慾之誘起，大槪由腦的作用所致，抑制的方法，應努力使腦健全，才是根本解决。按編者臨床上的經騐，凡是有自凟—手淫—行為的靑年，我都教他們服「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic已經服過的人，都有很美滿底結果—自然而然地不再行手淫了，卽由手淫過度，所致頭痛，失眠，健忘，耳鳴，眼花等腦力虛弱的一切症候，也逐漸消失，以致腦力健全。</p>
<p>濫行手淫的人，因為精液排洩過多，致使內分泌的機能减退，則筋疲力衰，全身多病，精神抑鬱，呼吸迫促，心悸不寗，記憶减退，肌肉羸瘦，未老先衰，以及生死器機能障害，如陰萎，遺精，早洩等，我們要治療這些由內分泌機能减退—而發生的各種疾病，根本療法，惟有用內分泌製劑來補其不足，他無良法，現在市上販售的內分泌製劑—如司保命等，雖然汗牛充棟，但是有效的—還如鳳毛麟角，尚有奸商不顧道德。有多少—說眞方—賣假藥的劣品，購者應特別注意！</p>
<p>按編者臨床實騐，美林登西藥行經理的「還爾童」Well　Tonic效力最為可靠，因為牠是生殖腺（賀爾蒙）聯合製劑，乃由動物之睪丸，攝護腺，甲狀腺，副腎，腦下垂體等之有效成分配合，照我的經騐，用「還爾童」Well　Tonic內服，每日三次，每次兩片，一瓶就可見效，如精神爽快，睡眠良好，食慾增進，全身脂肪增加，疲勞速行恢復，生死器機能如陰萎，遺精，早洩等，都能治愈轉機，生殖呂發育不全者，往往恢復，老人之衰弱者。有恢復生殖力及充足元氣之效，依動物試騐，確有延長壽命的功能，凡經我勸服「還爾童」的人，沒一個不恢復健康的，這是我的忠實證明！</p>
<p>如有劇烈的遺精—夢精—精液漏—等病者。這是因為精關不固所致。可服「育麟固精片」Juvenilin　Tab．效力超羣。而完全沒有流弊。為他藥所不及。按臨床實騐。大槪服一瓶卽可痊愈。</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3>甚麽是民族自信力？</h3>
<p>— 李建芳</p>
<p>「民族自信力！」「民族自信力！」當一般人愈是發狂似地呌着道一口號時，這一口號便愈失去其原有之意義。</p>
<p>有些人說，民族自信力，不外是對於中國固有道德之信仰；另些人說，提倡民族自信力，就在於知道我們是有數千年歷史的民族；又有些人說，提倡民族自信力，應時保存國粹保存中國文化；更有些人說，提倡民族自信力，就在於我們不忘先賢和崇拜先賢！</p>
<p>「民族自信力」，「民族自信力」，在需要這一口號以行其欺騙之能事的人看來，它簡直是希臘旦達流斯（Deadalus）之彫刻了。</p>
<p>究竟甚麽是民族自信力呢？</p>
<p>要說明甚麼是民族自信力，當先說明甚麼是個人自信力。所謂個人自信力，是不是像阿Q被人揪住辮子在壁上碰了四五個響頭，而口裏仍念着「兒子打老子」那種「精神勝利」的精神呢？當然不是！個人自信力雖然少不了堅強的意志和熱情，但像阿Q這樣堅強的意志和熱情，决算不得自信力的。假如硬要說，這也是一種自信力，那最多也只能說，是自信力的滑稽表現，决不能說，是自信力的莊嚴表現。</p>
<p>那末，甚麼是個人自信力？個人自信力之最粗略的認識，應當是個人從理智和經騐之中，從對於自己的能力和所追求的事業之深刻的認識和把握之中所產生的一種信心。由此看來，則所謂民族自信力，當不外是一民族從自己的理智和經騐之中，從對於自己的能力和自己希望的偉大的民族鵠的之認識和把握中所產生的一種萬人共信心而已。</p>
<p>如果這個肯定是不錯的，那末，不但提倡恢復舊道德，提倡保存國粹，保存中國文化，提倡偶像崇拜，提倡誇大狂算不得是提倡民族自信力，就是空洞地提倡愛國愛民族的熱情，而不啟發國民的智力和批評精神，也同樣算不得是提倡民族自信力。為甚麼？因為感情的強力是不能不和邏輯的嚴正相一致的。不合邏輯的嚴正相一致的熱情，不論是出自個人和民族，最多只能說明一種可尊敬的無用，莊嚴的兒戲而已。白蓮教運動，未嘗沒有高尚的愛國愛種的熱情，但是只因他們對他們的時代之無知，他們的運動，他們的犧牲，不但無益於中國，反而因此更加深了中國之被壓迫和崩潰。</p>
<p>所以，我說民族精神或民族自信力，决不是單純的民族情操表現，它寗是國民大衆對於其時代之深刻的認識和對於自己的能力之深刻的把握之總合的表現。民族情操固為民族自信力之重要原素，但假如民族情操不是建築在成功之不可避免上，則所謂民族情操一定容易變為昨日的黃花！</p>
<p>就是在我們日常生活之中，也有不少的事情如從感情一方出發雖是能深深地能攫住我們的心靈則使其受痛苦的，但一從理智一方出發，則却完全變為沒有意義的東西了。人能說給與情操以最強烈的瞬間的刺激的東西，同時必定對於民族及國家的生活有深刻的實踐的意義麼？</p>
<p>從此可知，對於固有道德，倫理。國粹乃至感情之偏重，不但不能把國民的感覺和注意力引導到對於實際現象之瞭解和硏究以產生自信力途上去，並且會把他們引導到相反方面去，引導到直接敵視深刻瞭解和硏究，因而產生種種幻想之途徑上去。民族自信力之提倡，至此，不能不變為民族自殺之提倡！</p>
<p>這樣看來，祇有民族熱情和民族知識達於統一和一致時，才能產生第三種東西——民族自信力，這確是確切不搖的！</p>
<p>基於此，可知目前的中國思想界所提倡的種種復古反動和崇拜幽靈運動，不但不是提倡民族自信力，簡直是從根本上消滅民族自信力。</p>
<p>凡是科學興趣，批評精神日漸减低的地方，個人的理智更愈失其力量。凡是一民族中各個人的理智愈失其力量時，他們便愈求助於幻想和英雄的拯救，因而便失去民族自信力。中國第一次亡國於北方胡人，不亡於知識渙發的春秋戰國時代，而發生於儒釋統治中國後的魏晋，　社會關係變革使然，而思想的牢籠和其時的國民因思想之牢籠，而求助於超自己的神秘思想傾向之發展也大大的有以促成之！</p>
<p>其實，任何一種偉大的歷史運動或社會運動，它不僅是符合其時的國民的或階級的實際的利益的結果，並且也是一種批評精神，理智和思想運動之結果。宗教的幻想成為歷史運動之旗幟的時代已經過去了。現在一切的解放運動，尤其是中國民族解放運動，如果牠不能澈底的先來一個思想和批評精神解放運動，以激發全民族的智力和熱情，那是完全沒有希望的。</p>
<p>說到這裏，我對於「甚麼民族自信力」這一問題似不應再有所解說了。臨末，我只希望讀者須得認定一點：就是那些一方面提倡復古提倡國粹提倡偶像崇拜，他方面，反對新思想運動，反對批評精神，反對言論自由的人，决不是提倡民族自信的力的人，相反；他們簡直是民族解放運動之墳墓挖掘者！</p>
<h3>中國史部目錄學</h3>
<p>— 應普漢</p>
<p>鄭鶴聲編　商務印書館出版</p>
<p>本國史是我祖先活動的記載，我們均有全部明瞭之必要。若無此種知識，即不能眞正了解我們今日所處之地位。唯欲明白過去，了解現在，則不能不有賴乎「通史」。我國史家梁啟超先生前曾打算編一部精審完備的「中國通史」，「以為現代一般人活動之資鑑」。可惜他的一生歲月大部分化在做官上了，以致這種偉大的計劃終於沒有實現。這不消說是一件大憾事。直到現在，我們簡直沒有一部精審完備的本國史，故欲明瞭我國民族之進化狀况，除直接閱讀史部諸書外，實在沒有第二個好辦法。</p>
<p>但治學之道，首在得門徑；讀史當然亦不能例外。目錄學是讀書的門徑，史部目錄學是讀史的門徑。鄭鶴聲先生編的這本中國史部目錄學，就是讀中國史部諸書的好的門徑書之一。</p>
<p>全書分十章：（一）古史淵源，（二）史部位置，（三）史部源流，（四）史部正錄，（五）史部另錄，（六）史部今錄，（七）史部分類說，（八）史料分類法，（九）史體論，（十）結論。編者在叙例上說，「第一章略叙我國史書之淵源，以正其本。第二三章叙述史部之位置與源流，以槪其要。第四五六章叙史目之流別，以窺其微，正錄以觀其同，別錄以觀其畢，今錄以觀其變，三者俱備，而後流別可槪覩矣。第七章叙劉知歲以下諸家史部分類法，俱未實行著錄，故胃之說。……第八九章叙錄史料與史體之分類法，略見現今學者對於史部之分合，亦史部目錄學之變相也。其第十章先叙先民著錄，以糾其謬，後立史部分類，以曉其舊」。讀者看了，即可明瞭本書的大凡。</p>
<p>我國之有史部目錄學，由來極久，如歷代諸史志及四庫書目書目答問等，凡治史者，無不習誦多曉。本書除依據前賢著述，作有系統之編制外，編者或時參己見，加以辨正，或取法歐西，全改舊貫，是以創穫之處頗多。今請舉其犖犖大者數端於下，以見本書之價値：</p>
<p>（一）辨正得失——偽史一目，最為不經，歷代目錄學家，或因囿於舊說，或因處境關係，對之無敢明目張膽加以駁正者。本書編者於史部源流偽史一目下辨之曰：「案偽史以紀偽朝國史，其義與覇史同，可不問其為誰作。四庫書目以後人追記者為載記，當時自撰者為偽史，故以越史略朝鮮史略兩書，附於其末。夫覇偽之名，最為不經，重內輕外，雖有春秋褒貶之誼，而尊此　彼，實失史家平衡之的。殊俗之見旣深，同化之源磨覩。且各是其是，俱為正朔，「曹魏指吳蜀為寇，北朝指東晋為僭，南謂北為索虜，北謂南為島夷。」諸如此類，豈得公平。然當時為敵，或鼓脣舌，後人作史，宜為鑑衡。不當溯其成見，詔示後生。故子元論史，只分正雜，不曰眞偽。足見大公無私，成敗昭然，無待美剌。賓主旣判，善惡難明。是則偽史　類，頗有議焉。」</p>
<p>（二四頁）又如編者糾正四庫總目曰：「晚出之四庫總目，共分類條例，最為詳精，然歧誤之處，亦不能免，姑以舊式史目義例言之，如東觀漢記，及各家後漢書，舊志俱無正史，而總目則歸諸別史，其別史類例曰：「案東觀漢記後漢書補逸之類，本皆正史也；然書已不完，今又不列於正史，故槪入此門」。又正史類例曰：「案註釋諸史之書，皆各從其類，若茅國縉蔣之翹之晋書，刪改原文，宋史新編之屬，非其本書。五代史補，五代史缺文，亦增益於本書之外，如斯之類，則均入別史焉」。觀其別史之定義，則為「上不至於正史，下不至於雜史」之書。然其界限，果何在乎？上列諸史，本為紀傳之體，以其書已不完，今又不列正史，刪改原文，增益於本書之外，遽名之為別史，則體例之謂何？分類標準，旣不一致，故覇史之中，有紀傳焉。有編年焉。有紀事本末焉。以其紀錄羣雄也，則名之為覇史，其餘雜史別史類此。而紀傳編年之中，又有覇史雜史別史諸書。寗足為例類之標準者乎？……」（二三四—二三五頁）此種辨正得失之處，本書觸目皆是；此間僅備一例，故不多舉。</p>
<p>（二）編者的史部分類——我國之史部目錄，無論正錄，別錄，今錄。此實由我國學術分類，缺乏科學性所致。且自晚近以來，地質學，考古學以及其他科學日漸發達，地下實物史科之被發現者亦日衆；於是史部範圍，遂驟形擴大。舊時史部目錄之須改編增訂，已成為學術上急不容緩之事。本書編者有鑒于此，特取法歐西，於結論中立一「今後史部目之分類法」，昭示學人。其法分史為「史書」「史纂」「史物」三者。史書可分二類：其叙述各事蹟，滙通而參互交貫者曰「通史」。通史又可分為兩類，其以時代為單位者，如史記以下諸正史及編年諸史是也。其以事蹟為標準者，如通典通考及紀事本末諸史是也。共敘述史事之一部份，或交通，或學術，或風俗，或美術者曰「專史」。如中國交通史，宋無學案，明儒學案，東洋藝術滋料，中國風俗史等是也。至於史纂，亦可分為三類：其雜述事蹟，不分類例者，如山海經，國語，國策以及雜誌報章等曰「雜錄」其彙次成編有端緒可尋者，如各種政要會要及類書等曰「彙錄」。其有注補考訂詮釋表譜圖志之屬，足補原史之闕者，如史記志疑，三國志補注等曰「補相」。至器物圖表，標本模型，與史書史纂，並無輕重之殊。然必以時代為標準，或以地域為歸宿，則提綱豐挈領，條目井然。所謂以時代為標準者，或以唐虞三代秦漢之名，首以為綱，而後細列某時代有史書若干種，史纂若干類，史物若干件。而後再舉史書中孰為通史，孰為專史；史纂中孰為雜錄，孰為彙錄，孰為補訂；史物中孰為標本，孰為模型，孰為圖表。而後再舉通史中孰為直通，孰為橫通。專史中孰為交通，孰為學術等等……至於以地域為歸宿者亦然，或以省區，或以縣區……無不可也。」（二三七—二三八頁）此分類法綱舉目繫，讀者一覽，即可瞭然，洵古今史部目錄之最簡明者矣。</p>
<p>此外如淸儒孫星衍之祠堂書目，世多忽之，而編者則推崇備至，一則曰「實開目錄學上未有之先例，而釐然有當於學術」；再則曰「簡而得要，疏而不漏」。固以孫氏書目，能別出心裁，自為區域，實有被推重的價値；而於此亦可見編者之卓識了。</p>

<h3>略談畫報</h3>
<p>— 玉輝</p>
<p>中國畫報的材料十有六八是從國外的畫報剪來的，但中國的畫報在世界上的畫報中却是別具一型的。</p>
<p>當你走進一家書店的時候，在許多書籍與雜誌中，最先吸引你的眼光的，必定是那些有着鮮麗的色彩的畫報。這　畫報的封面，大都是印着時下某些影星與名媛的倩影，或者是富有肉感性的裸體畫（請讀者注意最近某畫報的廣吿，他們最着重的，就是一幅裸體畫的封面），這好像是一種規定，同時亦足為現在出版界某種傾向的代表。</p>
<p>我們並不否認，畫報比較上是屬於消閑一類的出版物，但我們亦不能否認畫報是富於宣傳與報導的功能。畫報是以具象的材料報導一切，訓示一切的，所以較抽象的文章來得分外明瞭而且切實。就因為他需要讀者深思，就因為他是易觸知的，具象的，所以他能够深入社會的各階層，能够發生最偉大的作用。他無無形之間，在讀者不知不覺之間，負起了潛移默化的任務。總之，畫報是一種重要的出版物。</p>
<p>世界最著名的畫報，在英國是「Illustrated　London　News」（星期刋），看到他那富有古典風度的樸素的封面，就可以曉得他與中國的畫報有着多麼不同的面貌。這裏你找不時美人的倩影，看不見大脚與乳峯，而每一期却有一篇考古的文章，剛出土的古物在這裏留下了他的姿影，皇家學院聲，光，電等的發明，各地風俗生活的介紹。次外，你還可以看見一柴內容是充實的，但筆調又是那樣輕鬆的文章，跟那些圖畫十分相稱。自然，國內外的大事的寫眞，他們亦絕不吝嗇地化去許多篇幅。美國的「New　York　Times　Midweek　Pictorial」（星期刋）亦有着特別的地方，像美國人的個性一樣。這裏五色紛陳，亦注意新式的服裝與家庭的陳設，或是某州某后的倩影，但佔去最大篇幅的，還是國內外時事的報導同科學發明等的介紹。法國的「Illustation」（星期刋）跟英國的「倫敦畫報」一樣，沒有大腿之類，大多數的挿圖都有詳盡的說明，登出的文章亦富於時間性同趣味。此外德國的「Berliner　Illiutrierte　Zeiting」（星期刋）在希特拉握政之後；每期都是大砲，轟炸機，新式潛艇，勇敢的納粹黨員的寫眞。大會操的照相用大張的紙複印出來。上面這些都是非常著名的畫報，他們相同的地方，就是對於國內外的時事的注意。他們每一期都很新鮮，南斯拉夫國王歷山大同法外長巴爾都在馬賽被殺時，一星期後，美國，英國的畫報就有當時的寫眞，甚至是臨殺前的一瞥。他們時常以極大的代價去買得照相。而他們大半是星期刋（全世界著名的畫報可說全是星期刋）的原因，我想亦無非着重寫眞的時間性的原故。</p>
<p>但中國的畫報呢，相形之下，是頗使我們失望的。只稍注意到他們以最引動讀者的封面讓給一些美人，就可見出畫報編者的態度與用意了。有些甚至利用他本身的特點，來登載一些豬肺與人之屁股之比較，某校高材生的肖影（此外還有一些無聊的文學作品）等等，以肉麻為有趣，以無聊作正經，而傾重裸體畫與明星名媛的影家雖說是適應讀者的要求，但我們却不能不承認，讀者層這種興趣的養成是與這些雜誌有着密切的關係的。今日，你走進一個靑年人的房間裏，十人中有九人的案頭上必貼有，掛有某些影星或美人魚的影片，中國靑年在這種苦難的環境中還有這種問題，還有這種心情，今日的畫報編者是不能辭其咎的。至於畫報應當採取什麼樣的態度，我上面已約略提到了。總之，假使不偏重啟發與報導這兩方面，我寧可中國出版界沒有畫報。</p>

<h3>所望於國貨推銷團者</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>失業，人生最威痛苦事也。貧苦靑年之失業，尤極人問世之苦痛。因不盡職或溺職而失業，固無可憫，以市况不景氣而被裁失業，尤極人間世之悲憫。上海職業指導所成立八年，紹介失業靑年以數千計，迄於今亦感山窮水盡，無門可入之憾矣：顧失業者，却排山倒海而來，求事愈難，而求職者愈衆。有日以燒餅充飢者，有露宿風樓者，所中同人，旣忘其職責之艱且巨，盡其能力，爲失業者謀出路，顧僧多粥少，抱向隅者不知幾何人。蓋現成之局有限，非開新路，决不足以容納如許之失業者。僉謂復與事業，英要於提倡國貨，與其坐而言，孰若起而行。彼社會上失業之大衆，曷不用其心與力，俾之自食，是莫妙於小本之負販。此意國貨界前輩天虛我生倡之，已有接踵起者，因有國貨推銷圍之組織。在上海職業指導所指導之下，於本月初實行，先事選取十人試之，開辦費一人約五元，費五十元，而十人之生路以闢。一方推廣國產之銷路，一方推持一人一家之生計，行未十日，而社會稱之，有盛君者，遺書該所，斥五十元請益其額，俾更擴十人之生路，不啻爲國貨增十個生力軍，人之好善，誰不如我，苟課最有功，則十人，百人，千人非難事，而失業者之悲憫，或可少。國貨界之不景氣，亦有剝極而復之望。凡爲團員者，宜如何努力苦幹，誠信自矢，以打開艱難之局面。所願愛國而熱心國貨者，同情斯舉，如桴鼓之應，俾顚連無告之失業靑年，人人有自食其力之機會，而國貨界之生機，亦得油然萌茁，其關係云何不鉅。謹於國貨推銷團開辦伊始，輙懸此義以禱其成。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨與產業革命</h3>
<p>— 喬耘飱</p>
<p>上月財政部頒布廢止銀元實行法幣的命令，這是中國財政史上的一大轉變；政府一方面固然防北白銀的外流，一方面却因商市經濟農村經濟枯窘到極點，毅然行使新貨幣，藉此昭甦調劑舉國上下的竭蹶金融狀態：據銀行家告訴我們，通貨膨脹，實在因爲企圖收買白銀的國家網羅不已，我們的奸商，以爲大利所在，不惜斵喪民族經濟的元氣，拚命的居間助紂爲虐；這麼一來，準大多數人的意見，國產貨物，不難逐漸活躍，最低限度，進出口數目字，可有平衡的希望；這是官騰了多年提倡國貨的一大助力，我們很爲民族經濟前途深致慶幸；但是另一方面需要知道，提倡國貨是件多方面應該注意的運動，比方大家都表現了服用國貨眞誠，而沒有精良的國產，出來代替，或許是貨品可與舶來媲美，但是售價奇昂，或竟某外貨充斥市塲，乃沒有相當某外貨的發明，售價奇昂，初非國貨商人過意抬高，或被血本牽累！或被製造技術掣肘！在在是提倡國貨的大障礙。說到這裏，我們不得不推想及「產業革命」的一句話了；民生主義上面有這樣一段……假若是產業尙未發達的社會，則一方面發展國家資本，重要生產及公用事業，歸於公，則獎勵私人企業，在資本社會化的原生下，保護私人資本，使產業向產業革命的途徑發展！……這短短的幾句話，當然是指粗枝大棄而言，解决重要生產事業的迷津，我倒要曲解一下，大槪「改良出產」，「减低貨價」，也可附庸於「產業革命」旗幟之下吧？現在需要經營出產事業者也向革命途徑上邁進，如何改精出品，可與外貨抗衡，如何减低貨價，輕鬆服用者的負担；我最近感到兩件學校用品，實在太不高明，一蠟紙，大有非用外貨不可之勢，國產中有貨價達三元一筒者，印不到一二十張，就開天窗，不堪再印；一粉筆，甫及黑板，接連的斷成粉碎，損失金錢，消耗時間！更要降洛購用者的熱忱，這雖然不可代表一般的國產蠟紙粉筆，但是我戚到的兩種，未嘗不是堂哉皇哉標榜着唯一的國產—我們要解决這些問題，自應希望產業革命，產業革命的工具，還要歸納到「科學」—因爲只有科學—纔是救國的總關鍵咧。</p>
<h3>僑胞愛用國貨</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>此次馬來亞華僑選手，回國參加第六屆全國運動會，大獻身手，各界僉表示歡迎，本埠五和織造廠美亞織綢廠中華琺瑯廠中國化學工業社等亦曾設筵公宴。中央僑務委員會，因職責所在，特電邀各選手赴京參觀，自十月二十三日前往，寓於中央軍官學校，二十六日回滬，由該會特備車輛，幷供給午膳，附掛於上午八點鐘開之特快車上，籌成因新藥業赴京向行政院衛生署請願，亦乘是車返申，乘間與副領隊王景成君暢談，茲將關於提倡國貨方面之情形，補錄如下：</p>
<p>王景成君，係福建籍，生長國外，從未回國，今年三十七嵗，面貌與正領隊胡文虎君相似，在馬來亞方面，担任學校報社等委員職務，熱心公益，據云此次百餘選手中，有百分之九十五初次回國，前日抵京時，參觀各處，覺建築富麗，道路整潔，不亞國外，各界同胞對於渠等和靄可親，不勝感謝，所見國內各工廠之出品，較舶來品有過之無不及，而價値則便宜多矣。此種貨品，在國外從未見過者佔多數，希望以後設法推銷至南洋一帶，蓋僑胞愛護祖國之心，較任何人更殷，日盼祖國富强，以提高身份，同一貨品，卽國貨較外貨粗劣而稍貴：亦情願購用國貨，况並未粗劣而又價靡乎。此次在京所得兩種物品，最爲寳貴，一係中央軍官學校敎育長張治中代表蔣委員長所贈之佩劍，予雖非武人，亦當珍藏，一係南京出產之京緞緞，市上雖已少見，但我輩僑胞購往，可以製成物品，以留紀念。</p>
<p>各選手在車上，有翻閱首都地圖，以指示此次游覽之處所者，有口吹丰携風琴，以歌唱各種雄壯之名曲者，有追憶運動情况，以說明比賽獲勝之訣竅者，天眞爛漫，皆大歡喜。經常州，見有質蓖箕木梳者，告以此係常州有名之出產品，渠等遂爭先恐後而紛購，裝以錦匣，預備歸贈親友者。過無錫，見小販所售之泥佛，有劉關張三弟兄之偶象者，有觀世音菩薩者，有濟癲僧和尙者，有楊貴妃出浴者，僉謂見所未見，經予告以各種名稱後，亦彼此爭購，供於面前，以資欣賞。抵蘇州，除小販兜售瓜子糖菓外，幷有賣花女持白蘭花而叫喊者，各選手因此種物品，亦國外所少見，咸紛購以嘗試，襟上俱懸花一束，全車芬芳撲鼻。予曰君等所購者，均眞正國貨，且係常錫蘇著名之土產，渠等僉曰我輩本願提倡國貨，此行可謂不虛矣</p>
<h3>婦女國貨年的成效</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>二十四年十一月十八日申報國貨週刋載有據國貨貿易局的報告：本年十個月，香水脂粉之由外國輸入者共値關金三十五萬六千三百十八元，合國幣六十三萬四千三百十三元，認爲可驚之數，但與上年比較，實已减少過半，不可謂非婦女國貨年後之成效。試閱本年一月十五日機聯會出版之國貨新聲第七十一期，內載二十三年一月至十一月，香水脂粉由外國輸入者，共値關金八十一萬八千六百四十元，合國幣一百五十八萬零八百九十八元，若以十一個月平均，卽每月流出金錢爲十四萬三千四百餘元，今年十個月平均，祗有六萬三千四百餘元，不啻减爲四四折，足見一百人中，已有五十六人不用外國貨矣。大凡移轉風尙，無不由衆好衆惡之觀念，旣有過半數人，不用外國貨，自必已有過半數人愛用國貨，其有少數人尙在用外國貨者，大抵由於醉心歐化過深，向來用慣高貴品者，總覺國貨中無可與之比並，因而不得不舍此就彼，猶之食米一般，吃慣機白粳頭號米者，若令改吃糙米，卽使無償贈與，亦必不能强其下嚥，故我以爲挽回外溢利權，其重要之關鍵，仍在國貨工廠家之製品方面，一味在偸工減料，廉價競爭上着想，實為錯誤觀念，蓋諺所謂賤貨不好，好貨同不賤，實爲確切不移之公例。專麥起碼米或二號米，而不賣頭號米之米店，任以廉價號召於市，亦决不能吸引富戶上門來買，可斷言也。或謂進口化妝品之减少過半，實由購買力減少之故，但就家庭工業社一家而論，今年比較上年，不過减少九折，而舶來品减少至四四折，足見不因購買力而致然也，惟在今後，凡屬舶來品，大都漲價二成以上，半國貨亦必漲價，兩兩相形，必有此長彼消之顯例，明年或能在國際貿易表中，變入超數而爲出超，亦非必不可能也。</p>
<h3>國貨補品</h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>到了冬天，爲要抵抗寒氣侵襲，和增强來春的體量起見，必須要進一些補品。在這新時代中，最普遍的補品當推魚肝油，因爲它的補益的力量比較顯著，但是舶來品魚肝油動不動就需三四元錢一瓶，祗有錢多的人才吃得起，講經濟的人就不敢嘗試；並且覺得把大利流到外國人的腰包裏，也有些可惜。</p>
<p>自從五洲藥房提出「使人人都有補益機會」的口號以來，頗博社會一般人的同情，同時五洲對於自製的麥精和乳白兩種魚肝油，加緊研究改良；埋頭苦幹的結果，如今出品效力，美味，並不在舶來品之下，而售價還反不到航來品一半呢。我希望今後吃外貨魚肝油的，都能改吃國貨魚肝油，那不但可以開源節流，並且因服國貨補品而獲康健，也是有價値的康健呀。</p>

<h3>値得歡迎介紹的「中國油燈」</h3>
<p>— 筱石</p>
<p>通都大邑，電燈通夜光明，內地農村，還是盛行煤油燈。不要說電燈不易設置，就是有了電燈，窮苦農民，無力享受這光明的幸福。鄉人稱媒油燈爲洋燈，以其來自外洋也，燃燒的媒油，稱爲洋油，因其亦屬注貨。苟全國平均每家用一只洋燈—實在不止此數—就需要一萬萬只以上。洋燈的損失，還是有限，而每天洋油的損失，眞是不可計數。</p>
<p>現在有個好消息來了，有精美適用的中國油燈出現了，吾于一個月前，在報上見到有人發明中國油燈的一個新聞，乃于前日在友人處，見到事實的證明，眞使吾歡喜欲狂。這油燈是上海中國油燈公司的出品，爲八掛牌商標，完全國貨。燃燒的原料，不是煤油，不是洋油，乃是農村中隨地所有的豆油，菜油，花生油。發光明亮，遠勝洋橙，形式有台燈掛燈，亦極優美，燈泡更見光潔，眞使吾佩服，使吾歡喜。吾敢深信不久的將來，這八卦的中國油燈，必能風行于全國。以吾所見，其優點還有下列數點。</p>
<p>用中國燈，點中國油，尤其是農村中固有的原料，不獨價格較洋油爲廉，並且還可减少一筆鉅大的損失；優點一。旣稱煤油，當然有煤氣，睡後如不熄火，早起，鼻中就有黑氣，享不到電燈幸福的人們，都有此經騐，今改用豆油，就可免此弊病，若燃菜油，更有明目之功：優點二·煤氣最有害於人身，爲害於肺部更烈，對於有肺病的人，直是雪添霜，豆油菜油，爲平常食料，不獨毫無媒氣，更且一些沒有烟氣：優點三。煤油遇火卽着，因潑翻煤油燈而　成火災者，所在都有，豆油就無比弊害：優點四。</p>
<p>八卦牌中國油燈，旣有此種種優點，安得不令人歡迎，樂爲介紹。有人嘗慨歎中國人愛用洋貨，其實中國人沒有不愛國，不愛用中國貨者。只要有適用的代替品，自會受人愛用，卽此一燈而論，人人贊成。吾曾將此燈介紹於多數農人，他們經實地證明後，沒有一個人不贊成樂用的都要託吾代他買一盞，並且大家還說中國人比前長淮了。可見愛國是天賦的良心，就此一端以觀，中國前途，大有希望。</p>

<h3>淋病的適當處置</h3>
<p>— 袁一民醫師</p>
<p>淋病是一個難治的症候。是任誰都不能否認的。其所以難治者。半雖由於淋菌之不易盡滅。要亦半由於病家之不嚴守攝生。更或有時因治療之不完全等。在在足以使本症遷移時日。循至慢性而後已。此際病變地位的擴大。若治療不得妥善之方。可謂永元絕根之望。斯時淋菌常深匿於粘膜內。外表觀之。固未有絲毫之他覺症狀。即病家自己。亦無甚不舒之感。然每逢身體過勞。暴飮等。均足復發。從前對於淋病治療。僅有內服洗射。數年來。醫學之昌明。出人意表。如色素及混合淋苗之注射。强力內服透膜殺菌劑「滅殺淋」MESALTROPIN。短波透熱電及最新療濁機。以及局所用淋病血淸「淋毒舒樂耳」GONOSEROL之注入等。數美俱具。功效之佳。超越一切療法。誠治淋法中之最妥善者矣。但此種方法。務須就富有經騐之專門醫師。庶藥量和病情。能得相當之準確度。如本埠法租界六六號春在醫院。聘有醫師多位。婦女診察。另有女醫生助診。電療器械。應有盡有。設備之完善。醫治之適當。一時可謂無出其右。</p>

<p>鴉片之主要成分爲嗎啡。嗎啡係肥難脫速之誘導體。能麻痺大腦。就中由痛覺而起之反射運動亦被麻痺。所以醫家咸一致認其止痛有效劑。恒用之以達止痛之目的。但施用嗎啡後。獨脊髓之反射興奮性反爲亢進。對於某種動物。則能起强直。恰如蕃木　鹼。日本田村憲造氏實騐之結果。謂所以能起如此强直者。因嗎啡酸化而生於體內之結晶性尼脫羅梭嗎啡。或因其酸化而生之無晶形物質也。其作用類似蕃木　鹼與疋克羅妥克辛之混合物。此痙攀毒如更酸化則失其毒性。而於溫血動物酸化尤爲迅速。故極少見有痙攀現象。但若與以多量之尼脫羅梭嗎啡或注入之硬腦膜腔時能起痙攀耳。他如怕怕肥林。可提因。那露科挺等之麻醉作用。均比嗎啡弱。</p>
<h3>胃藥之選擇</h3>
<p>— （馬訪翁醫師）</p>
<p>胃臟疾患之通常症候。大率爲噁心。嘔吐。吞酸。嘈雜。胃痛。腹部膨脹感等。患斯症者。除妨碍飮食營養外。神經亦大受其損害。若一任遷延不治。則胃壁潰爛。有造成胃潰瘍之虞。考此等症候之適宜藥物。莫亞爾加里劑若。亞爾加里製劑中之特出優良者。其為「胃寳」乎。蓋「胃寳」有種種超出一般普通製劑之藥效。並簡述如下。（一）常服無害。（二）有特强之止痛止吐之功。（三）助長消化。調理胃之生理機能。（四）能中和胃酸。吸收胃腸中之有害物質。（五）芳香可口。利於服用。有斯美效。譽爲胃病聖藥而有餘。該藥每盒二元。經售處本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社。</p>
<h3>淋疾良藥</h3>
<p>— （蔣國藩醫師）</p>
<p>淋病的治療方法。在現時固以混合淋苗及色素之注射。與夫短波透熱電最新療濁機之電械治療爲最有速效。但有因遠居鄉間。或職務繁忙。未得充分時間可以就醫治療。或爲其他等等之關係限制時。則非藉自療之法不可。自已治療。普通病家所可施行者。僅內服法及局部注入法而已。內服藥當以有强力之透膜殺菌力。若止痛消炎諸功效者爲上。若滅殺淋然MESALTROPIN。此藥治淋上之宏偉藥效。疊經張守銘。陳培基。袁一民諸醫師撰文贊賞以來。早已譽滿醫林。卽一般病家。亦多樂用。至外用藥。普通終以藥液殺菌法。此法在醫者施諸病人。猶可詳察病情。而定注入之數量。藥液之濃度。存留之時間。若病家自已施行。必難如此準確。今德國滿爾志大藥廠發明之『淋毒舒樂耳」GONO-SEROL係用淋病血淸和舒樂耳所製成。有自動免疫之功效。以此注入尿道局部。等於注射混合淋苗。誠爲淋疾之良藥。（滅殺淋及淋毒舒樂耳二藥。均歸本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。前者每盒一元。後者每盒二元五角。編者。）</p>
<h3>滅絕菌治癬之實騐</h3>
<p>— （孫志耀醫生）</p>
<p>癬雖微疾。但任之不治。則擴大而成頑癬。施治自較不易。癬之種類亦夥。如黃癬。白癬。陰癬。魚麟癬等。治療癬之成藥亦夥。經我臨床施用。認爲有確效者。莫過於滅絕菌MISULZINE。茲舉一例。爲有癬患者告。患者徐某。醫部及背腰部濕癬。因時間地域之限制。未得施行注射及人工太陽燈水銀石銀燈之電械療法。僅囑其購滅絕菌自行塗擦。如是凡二句。所患若失。患處無絲毫之病變瘢痕。施用是藥。旣無惡味。又不汚傳衣被。誠可謂優良之製品。該藥現歸本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。每盒僅售一元云。</p>

<h3>性神經衰弱的普通症候</h3>
<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>性神經衰弱原是神經衰弱的部分現象。因其於生殖器領域特殊顯現。故名。而其諸般普通症候。亦復發現於身體各部。非僅生殖器一部已焉。通常所見者爲不眠。但其型不同。或爲著明就眠障碍。或爲不能熟睡而易醒。五官器的刺戟均高。故每有感覺過敏的症狀。頭部除疼痛外兼有重感及不快感。過勞及酒後覺眩暈。間有噯氣嘔吐。消化器患神經性消化不良。便秘與下痢交互而起。患者日趨消瘦。筋肉亦疏鬆。服務後易感疲勞。爲此病之特徵。且不快感及無力感甚著明。故意志薄弱。精神難集中。思考及記憶力衰减。精神能力受着明障碍。如强迫從事勞役。則陡增顯著之上述病患。甚至可以成爲精神病。惟前述諸般病狀。爲一般神經衰弱的一部症候。在生殖器性神經衰弱時。當然生殖器領域之疾患爲特甚。前已述及。茲姑不贅。本症在昔時。僅以藥物治療。收効總嫌綏慢。迨晚近電器療法盛行。本症始有確切速痊之望。電氣療法中。尤以短波透熱電機爲上。至於藥物上。臟器療法。頗有價値。他如卵黃燐脂。有機性燐化合物。催春劑等。亦頗賞用。成藥如安爾神AROLSEN。臨證施用。頗收良效。（安爾神ARLSEN）係本埠法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售。每盒一元五角。編者）</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>平市學生遊行請願</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>北平之北平大學等公立私立十五個大學中的學生，於本月九日上午十時，在中南海前門集合，共赴居仁堂，向何應欽請願，反對任何分裂國家統一的事實，要求團結救亡，維護國家之完整，旋卽整隊在街市游行，共到學生千人以上，而還有西城外之燕京淸華兩大學學生五六百人，因西直門被警察關閉，致未得入城。這是自從上海停戰協定以來，二三年中，還是第一次聽見的學生請願運動。又據報載，平當局因恐引起「中外糾紛，已嚴囑各學校校長，『自動負責開導制止，維持秩序，勿受煽惑，倘有軌外行動，政府决不姑容」云云。我們忽然聽到北平學生有請願之舉，眞覺有丁令威化鶴歸來之威，「風景不殊，人事已非」，人間又換了一世，不知涕淚之何從！</p>
<p>近日華北正鬧着所謂「自治問題」，在若干日以前，天津曾有所謂「華北防共保安總司令」及「民衆自衛敢死隊」等怪名目的發現，這顯然是叛亂國家的行爲，應用到危害民國緊急治罪法上來，是再適切也沒有了。但也未遇到什麽阻止，還由是一般眞正的民衆去扯碎了他們的旗幟，才告收塲。這次北平學生游行，目的是為維護國權，幸而警察的干涉，尚只限於用警棍驅逐，否則，鬧起了什麼亂子，恐又是一塲不幸事。</p>
<p>不久中央日報曾載一社論，說今日之新聞檢查政策極不合理，國家危急到這個地步，但一般民衆還蒙在鼓裏，這未始非現今不合理之新聞檢查政策所致。這篇文章頗爲一般人所傳誦。因之，有若干人很希望中央能改革目前的新聞檢查政策，一方面，對於實未死的民氣，也希望中央能和它聯繫起來，作爲外交上有力的後盾，這一希望，誠然是國民大衆每個人都十分希望能够實現的。今日北平學生之游行請願，至少可說是一部分民氣的表達。這和另一部分華北的所謂民衆所發起的自治運動，民衆自衛敢死隊啊等等，兩者截然不同，我相信國民大衆是擎了滿腔的熱血，萬分熱誠的在希望政府能接受這份可貴的禮物了。</p>
<h3>姊姊</h3>
<p>— 英光軍</p>
<p>一想到姊姊，就給我多添出莫大的不安來。姊姊現在正陷在困境中，我却不能帮她的忙，使她早日脫除她的困境。然而小時候她却帮我們小兄妹作過好多事情。</p>
<p>說起姊姊，她簡直是我的第二母親。那時候，我們家里正過着大家庭的生活，女人們要分班燒飯的，家里種地，僱用月工和年工，飯菜全燒得很多。母親一上班，姊姊就成了我們的母親。她看護我們無微不至，妹妹連哭帶鬧有時把我都鬧急了，她却安心靜氣看顧她，那時如果沒有姊姊，我們幾個人眞不知</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>要怎樣呢，還有哥哥，也小姊姊四歲，和姊姊吵嘴。姊姊也不過十五歲，她却很能作個小母親。</p>
<p>到晚上，母親打發我們睡，時常對我們說：</p>
<p>「沒有姊姊，你們別想活這樣大，長大了可別忘了姊姊的恩情。才不辜負姊姊看待你們的盛情」。</p>
<p>是的，這話我一直到現在還記得牢牢的，抱歉的我僅只記牢姊姊的恩情，却沒有一絲報答她的當年看護的盛情。我太對不住姊姊了。</p>
<p>姊姊十六歲時，就學會給我們作鞋子，我同哥哥一天到晚在外面跑，穿鞋穿得特別費，姊姊隔不上六七天就要給我們作鞋，她因此打趣我們說：</p>
<p>「你兩個要作兩雙鐵鞋穿才行」。</p>
<p>穿的衣服，她也帮着母親作一多半，母親如果沒有她這樣一個賢良能幹的助手，一定照應不過來。</p>
<p>姊姊是個能幹的姊姊，是個好姐姐，所以每當有人來提媒時，我總和媒人作對，輕了時罵幾句，重了時就拿掃巴打。有一次胡二爺來保媒，讓我澆了一頭水。我還跳着脚叫道：</p>
<p>「壞蛋東西，快滾蛋，姐姐不用你保媒」。</p>
<p>我央求母親，不讓姐姐出嫁，把她留在家里一直到老：她待我們好，我們不忍叫她離開。但是母親不答應，可是也說不出道理，只說姑娘大了全要嫁出去的。我們覺得母親這話說的太對不住姊姊了，姊姊帮她作了那麼多的事，她忍心嫁出去她。</p>
<p>我們問過姊姊，問她願意不願意出嫁，姊姊總是紅着臉，不出聲，問急了，才說：</p>
<p>「姊姊不走，姊姊捨不得你們」。</p>
<p>我們把這消息告訴母親之後，就嘰嘲她了：</p>
<p>「媽媽，怎麼樣，姊姊自己都說不出嫁，你再別跟那媒人問長道短說姊姊出嫁的事情了」。</p>
<p>却好，因爲來幾次媒人所提的人家都不大相宜，姊姊的婚事總未妥，這一來，一直躭誤到二十七歲。到這時，我們明白過來從前留她不嫁的錯誤，一面還担心着她的喜事，希望能够快些辦成了才好。</p>
<p>姊姊却是一天比一天發老，似乎臉上也少有發笑的時候，但她愛護我們的心情還是和從前一樣的。這期間，因爲我在外面讀書，每年不常在家，一等見了面更顯得特別親切。想起從前舊事，常常自己不自覺地笑了，調侃着姊姊說</p>
<p>「現在我可不留你了，我還希望多上媒人呢」。</p>
<p>二十七歲這年冬天，依然是胡二爺作的媒，把姊姊的婚事保妥了，年紀大，連初婚的權利都未享受到，給人家娶作續弦去。過去之後，二年多相安無事，姊姊還生了一個女孩，雖然不幸夭折，却並未减退她對生活的淡漠，她很能安於位分作她的事情。</p>
<p>去年夏天接她寄來的一封信，說是男人行將另娶了，原故沒有，大槪是喜新厭舊吧？她叫我替她想想法子，而且還說出痛心的話，說她悔不該出嫁，叫她在人世上多受一回折磨。</p>
<p>我有什麽辦法，除非回去當面商議，然而我又不願回到烏烟瘴氣的故鄉去，她的困境因而延遲至今日不得解决。我眞對不起姊姊。</p>
<h3>剝死牛</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>一個開放賑米的喜訊似的；順福老頭家的病牛死了，幻覺中嗅着了牛肉的香味，使每一個人激起食慾的亢進，可是，這是一個乖戾的思慾呵。那頭牛與其說是病死的，不如說是老死的，與其說是老死的，又不如說是做死的。從年邁的有着一頭花白頭髮，一對憂　老眼，鼻孔下常凝着淸水涕的順福老頭嘴裏，我知道了那頭死牛簡略的歷史</p>
<p>六年前，順福老頭還有着一個磨屋，專給村子上人家磨着麵粉，玉黍粟，黃豆和其他許多隻糧，一家子便靠人家付給的磨工過日子，每天，每天，把那頭牛架在磨盤上拖着二三百斤的大石盤躑躅不息，稍微停頓一下便有脆辣的籐鞭聲落在牠瘦削的身上。到新麥登塲，到年底，磨房整天整夜沒休止地替人家磨食糧，順福老頭爲着生活不得不熬住辛苦，不得不鞭策着他的牛。牛亦爲着一點果腹的稻草，一點水，不得不吐着白沬跑，受那毒辣的鞭策。</p>
<p>在一個夏季瘟疫流行的時期，順福老頭的十七歲的兒子在外邊放牛得病死了，他就該這個兒子，悲痛地照大人那般排塲葬殮了。一筆錢是向恕保爺那兒挪借的。可是年成一年一年壞下去，沒出息歸償本利，年底就被把磨盤抬了去抵債。從此，磨房裏空閒了，順福老頭空閒了，牛亦空閒了。然而，這被債所造成的空閒，正形成了他和牠生活無所倚持的恐惶。</p>
<p>老夫婦倆的食糧，牛的食糧。那裏來？那裏來？那重重的石磨盤啊，順福老頭合家雖爲它流了不少汗，牛雖爲它化了不少力，但那總是一種生活，一種共存的生活！終於在去年下麥種的時候，向鄉董，向族長，向幾個大田戶再三求說。把本村的田畝分一點給他耕。於是順福老頭和他辛苦了幾年的老牛的生活又緊緊地縛到那支犁上去，把汗流向硬塊的黃土中。這在重爬上生活綫的順福老頭，還以爲是幸福的賜予吧？可是，幸福和生活又是不相容的冰炭！</p>
<p>順福老頭的牛終於病了，痿蹩在空閒的磨房裏，眼潤濕地瞪着，肚皮撳伏着，稻草扔在牠嘴邊亦不吃，牛醫生走到牠面前，搖搖頭就走了，一天，二天……幾乎成了一具牛的骨骼大標本，而死了。</p>
<p>『唉，牛是死了，我們兩架老骨頭不知到幾時？到幾時！』老太婆縮在磨房角落裏　順福老頭嘆息着。</p>
<p>剝死牛的小夥子那麼上勁地在七手八脚地忙着，紫黑的血滿染了他們的手，濺滿了幾柄小尖刀，骨和皮歸順福老頭收着賣錢，肉是大家分的，你割一塊，他割一塊，吝惜柴草和作料的人家就沒要。我叔父亦割了一大塊回來，在瓦罐裏燉着，加了茴香又加了醬油，將爛熟的時候，滿屋充溢着誘人食慾亢進的氣味。他叫我遲一點睡覺吃牛肉，我諉言辭謝了。他以爲我衛生不吃死牛肉，他說明在罐裏加以薑和糖。結果我仍沒有嚐，我不能忘懷這嘆息的話句：</p>
<p>『唉，牛是死了，我們兩架老骨頭不到幾時？到幾時！』</p>

<h3>「桃花」樹下的一塲春「夢」</h3>
<p>上海公司的國貨氷洪淋</p>
<p>人生最有趣的事情是做夢，一切浪漫的奇跡，現實世界中所不可能的事情。在夢的國土中都可以做到。</p>
<p>去年在上海公映的美國名片「羅宮綺夢「，主角埃地康泰所攝的那個少年，從羅馬陳列館裏被人家驅逐出來以後，獨自彳亍道左，忽然被古羅馬城中的衛士捉了去。於是他開始了種種奇怪的境遇：他一忽兒被拉到拍賣塲裏去，被賣做奴隸了；一忽兒又被皇后愛上了；一忽兒在粉膩脂香，美女如雲的宮中，周旋於粥粥的女兒陣中；一忽兒又被拘禁在陰森凄慘的地獄，……他歷盡了人生的齋遇，結果即原來是一塲大夢。</p>
<p>上海影片公司但杜宇導演的新作「桃花夢」，恰是一個和「羅宮綺夢」有着同樣風味的歌舞片。那片中有一大羣女孩子，都是那些在街頭資花賣報的，或者替人洗衣服的窮苦女孩，她們天天勞動着，在一起玩着。因爲有一次偶然的機會，參觀了富的堂皇的歌舞表演，大家便被一點浮華的虛榮所誘惑，其中最美麗的一個女孩（殷明珠飾），到溪邊浣衣，坐在桃花林下，神思恍惚地，竟漸漸入了夢境，於是這貧苦的浣衣女郎，忽然變成了紅極一時的歌舞皇后，頤指氣使，富貴榮華，不可一世，戀愛享樂，無所不至，結果却陷入不可救拔的悲慘境遇，哀哀切切地從夢中驚醒，洗衣補的主婦正怒目橫眉地站在前面……</p>
<p>夢的世界是最美麗，最浪漫的。「桃花夢」便是一切荒唐，浪漫的想象的世界。</p>

<h3>Peking University and Peiping University Authorities Urge Students to Attend Classes; Various Schools Exchange Views on School Affairs Daily and Decide to Adopt a Unified Approach; Ministry of Education Believes Students Have Not Engaged in Transgressive Actions, Telegrams Peiping Authorities to Protect Them; Hangzhou Students Also Paraded and Demonstrated in the Bitter Wind Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Jiang Menglin stated that the news in a certain country's newspaper that I would be leaving Peiping today to go south is completely inaccurate. Hu Shi and I will definitely not leave Peiping in the near future. All school affairs at Peking University have been proceeding as usual recently. This morning, a notice was issued urging students to attend classes as usual and not participate in external affairs. If it is necessary to report to the Ministry of Education on school affairs in the future, then I may make a trip south. The authorities of four schools, including National Peking University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, and Peiping University, have been meeting in recent days to exchange views on school affairs and have had sincere discussions. They have decided to adopt a unified approach to the implementation of school affairs. Xu Songming, the President of Peiping University, summoned the deans of various colleges this morning and instructed them to order students to attend classes and not to interfere in external affairs. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the actions of students from various schools in Peiping petitioning to oppose autonomy, according to a responsible person from the Ministry of Education, the ministry has received reports and has learned that the students and educators in Peiping recently expressed their concern purely for the unification of the country and have not engaged in any transgressive actions. In addition to telegraphing the presidents of various schools to guide them properly, the ministry has also telegraphed the responsible authorities in Peiping to protect the safety of the educators. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The weather in Hangzhou City is severely cold. Snow continued to fall after 2:00 PM today. More than 10,000 students from middle schools and above in Hangzhou City held a demonstration parade in the bitter wind to oppose the North China pro-autonomy movement and to support the students in Peiping. The order was very good. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

In order to prevent disturbances in Peiping, the military authorities have dispatched large sword and pistol squads to guard the entrances of various national and private universities today. Although Tsinghua, Yenching, Normal, Peiping, and Peking Universities have not formally announced a strike, no classes have been held. Student groups at Yenching University are more solid than at other schools. Students have stationed people at various entrances and exits, making it difficult for both students and faculty to enter and exit. Students are preventing professors from teaching. Therefore, some foreign students have returned to Peiping today. There is no basis for the rumor that a student was killed on Monday. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Conflict at Guyuan Not Ceasing; Puppet Troops Launch Another Surprise Attack on Baochang; Security Team is Weak, Battalion Commander Dies in Battle; Zhang Yunrong Goes to the Front to Deal with Everything; A Certain Important Japanese Figure Promises to Mediate and Stop the Conflict; However, They Say Guyuan and Baochang Should be Taken Over by Mongolian Troops</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhangjiakou reports that the conflict at Guyuan has not ceased. As of the evening of the 10th, loud artillery fire could still be heard nearby. Zhang Yunrong, the Garrison Commander of Chahar, returned to Zhangyuan on the 11th under the order of Song Zheyuan, and will go to investigate with Matsumoto, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangyuan. As of the morning of the 11th, news came from here that the security team stationed in Baochang had retreated towards Zhangbei in order to avoid conflict. Song Zheyuan is ordering Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying to negotiate with a certain important Japanese figure to stop the conflict. According to a certain important Japanese figure, mediation is possible, but the security teams in Guyuan and Baochang must all withdraw and be replaced by Mongolian security teams, whose numbers must not exceed the number of security teams. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Guyuan and Baochang in eastern Chahar were originally garrisoned by the 29th Army. Since the Desheng negotiations in June, they have been virtually designated as demilitarized zones and replaced by security teams. The commander of the general team is concurrently held by Zhang Yunrong, the garrison commander of Chahar, with a strength of 4,000. Currently, there are approximately 600 each stationed in Guyuan and Baochang. According to news from here, the security teams have recently been defending the borders and have not invaded the puppet territory. However, Li Shouxin's troops have been constantly attacking since last month. Because the overall negotiations in North China are urgent, the authorities have no time to deal with this. Some parties also recognize this as a minor issue. The real reason for the conflict is that the puppet side believes that Guyuan occupies a strategic position and puts pressure on Duolun and the border of Rehe. Therefore, they are forcing them to retreat under the pretext. It is predicted that the problem will not escalate. The Mongolian security team has approximately 200 people and is under the jurisdiction of the Mongolian Autonomous Committee. They are currently stationed on the northern border of Baochang. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Zhangyuan telegram reports that Li Shouxin's puppet troops in Duolun suddenly attacked Guyuan, and the fighting is fierce. At the same time, the situation in Baochang is also tense. The security team stationed there is on high alert. Li Kechang, the battalion commander of the team, led his troops in a fierce battle with the puppet troops yesterday. After receiving the report, the local authorities ordered Zhang Yunrong, the commander of the security team in eastern Chahar, to go to the front this afternoon to deal with everything. They are also negotiating with a certain important figure in Peiping and Chang to mediate. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to sources, Li Shouxin's puppet troops launched a surprise attack on Baochang late on the night of the 10th. The security team there is weak and unable to hold out. Battalion Commander Li Kechang died in battle. After receiving the report, the local authorities ordered Zhang Yunrong to go to the front at noon on the 11th and are negotiating with the Japanese side, who have agreed to mediate. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to news from Zhangyuan today, the fighting between the security team and the "Manchurian" army has ceased, but they are still in a standoff. Thirteen wounded soldiers from the security team have been transported to Zhangbei for treatment. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to reliable Chinese sources, Guyuan has been occupied by the "Manchurian" army. Currently, it is only known that the security team withdrew after the team leader was injured and killed. Details are unknown. Twelve wounded members of the security team have been transported to Zhangbei for treatment. The "Manchurian" army entered the city after the security team withdrew, so there was apparently no further conflict. Guyuan's transportation is inconvenient, so the actual situation is unknown. Even the Japanese spokesperson stated today that they have not received any news. According to unconfirmed Chinese news, Doihara is willing to mediate the Guyuan incident, but only if the Chinese authorities agree to allow Mongolian security teams to be stationed in Guyuan and Baochang after the "Manchurian" army withdraws. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>

Xiao Zhenying and Qin Dechun went to the Summer Palace together this morning to visit Song Zheyuan and consult with him. He Yingqin is still expected to reside in Peiping for a considerable period of time, so Xiong Shihui has already gone south to Nanjing to report on the progress. Chen Yi is still in Tianjin and will return to Peiping within a few days. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Regarding the issue of organizing the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Council, apart from diplomacy, preparations are already underway.

Preparations for everything have begun. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Opening of the London Naval Conference</h3>
<p>—Ang</p>
<p>The Five-Power Naval Conference opened in London on the 9th. The conference will last for six weeks. In a dangerous environment, Britain convened this conference. As Prime Minister Baldwin said, it is to "continue the work of previous conferences and do everything possible to avoid repeating the mistake of unlimited naval competition." However, since 1931, in the short period of four years, storms and waves have been gathering in the Pacific and the Mediterranean. Recently, the overall situation has changed, and the future is even more difficult to predict. It is impossible to restore the balance of power, and collective security is still in its embryonic stage. Like other international conferences, the naval conference will not achieve much success. This is obvious to anyone with sense.</p>
<p>The policies that various countries have adopted at this conference can be seen in the opening speeches of the representatives. The US policy is the same as at the preparatory meeting fourteen months ago. That is, to seek a reduction in the overall tonnage under the Washington and London treaties. In practice, it insists on the 5:5:3 ratio system. Japan, in the name of "ensuring the security of the country's national defense," seeks to "establish a common limit that major naval powers must not exceed their holdings and to establish a situation of non-threat and non-aggression." In other words, it demands equality with Britain and the United States. Britain mediates between the two. Its policy is more flexible. That is, to maintain the principles of the Washington and London treaties and adjust them to meet the changing international situation and the needs of various countries. The meaning is that it is not necessary to insist on the ratio system, but to make individual solutions in terms of quality and quantity. The French representative believes that the quantitative aspect is more complex than the qualitative aspect. The Italian side only passively does not advocate the establishment of a long-lasting and strict method. As for the representatives of the British colonies, most of them agree to continue the principles of the two treaties. Before the meeting, it was heard that the countries had not contacted each other. This time, the announced attitudes have not changed much. What is the solution to this deadlock?</p>
<p>Japan's demand for equality is the crux of the conference and a matter of principle in the negotiations between Britain, the United States, and Japan. If Britain and the United States do not make this concession diplomatically, it is tantamount to isolating themselves from the international community in the Far East. Political and governance issues may not be mentioned. Even if they are mentioned, there may not be a solution. However, the representatives of the countries concerned cannot but tacitly recognize that they have this in mind. Moreover, what Japan calls "non-aggression and non-threat" is nothing more than developing its policy of consolidating the rear in its continentalism. Therefore, even if Japan's demand for equality is recognized, it is difficult to reverse the trend of naval competition. The achievements of the Washington and London treaties were only to maintain the status quo and a temporary truce in naval warfare. Japan was temporarily afraid of the advantages of Britain and the United States, and it seemed to restrain itself slightly. In fact, it seized the opportunity to expand its military preparations with all its strength. Now that its wings are not yet fully grown, it has the ambition to dominate East Asia and resist Britain and the United States. Therefore, the naval problem has fundamentally accumulated. The only thing that can limit armaments is whether the financial resources can afford it.</p>
<p>However, this conference may not be a complete failure. In terms of the current situation, the abolition of submarines, which the United States advocated last time, is regarded by Japan as a military preparation that has reached equality with Britain and the United States. Its strategic effect is comparable to the air force and is sufficient to threaten maritime freedom or break naval blockades. France regards it as a tool to maintain its advantage over Italy. Although a complete abolition still seems hopeless today, restricting its wartime rampage, as stipulated in Article 20 of the London Treaty, can be expected to continue. After the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was established in June last year, the representatives of the two countries made similar declarations. It can be seen that the discussion of this issue in Europe has one less obstacle. If this point is passed, it can be said to be a kind of progress in humanitarianism. However, it will not have much impact on the overall situation itself.</p>

<h3>United States Stops Buying Silver; London Silver Market Stalls; 20 Million Ounces Dumped; Silver Prices Plummet and Cannot Be Quoted; Recent Situation Heard to Have Improved Slightly</h3>
<p>(London) As a result of the disastrous drop in world silver prices, London silver brokers have suspended trading for one day today. Sellers were seven times more than usual, mostly from the East, because of the belief that the United States has changed its silver purchase policy. The market dumped a huge amount of silver, from 18 million to 20 million ounces, and no one asked about it. Silver prices could not be quoted, the first time since the European War in 1914. The silver price was originally scheduled to be quoted at 4:15 PM, but since no one was buying, trading was temporarily suspended. However, the situation should be slightly clearer tomorrow. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Affected by the suspension of the London silver market, the silver price here today was delayed for a long time. The final price was set at 63 and 3/4 cents per ounce, down one cent from yesterday. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) After yesterday's disturbances, the London silver market has been less panic-stricken today. Far Eastern and Indian speculators are naturally facing difficulties given recent developments. Therefore, the number of sales today is not as large as yesterday. Many clients are selling at limit prices. People in the silver market now hold hope that spot prices can be quoted. As for forward prices, it may be difficult to settle for the time being. It is expected that spot prices can be settled at around 28 pence. The attitude of the United States has not yet been clarified. At the same time, foreign exchange rates are now feeling the reverberations of the silver market turmoil. The price of the pound sterling, converted to US dollars and gold pounds, is weaker, because there is fear that the US dollar will lack the stability if the US does not buy silver as before. Gold has benefited from the increase in the price of the US dollar. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Because the United States did not entrust purchases, the silver market could not be quoted and priced today, which is unprecedented in the London silver market, resulting in complete chaos in the market. In the past, around 2:00 PM, brokers would determine the price based on all sales and purchases, but when brokers gathered as usual today, they saw only sales and no purchase entrustments. Therefore, it was decided to temporarily suspend trading, hoping that the US Treasury Department would re-enter the market and absorb as much of the sales as possible. However, when trading resumed, the US Treasury Department was only prepared to purchase a small amount of silver at a lower price than yesterday, only one-seventh of the total sales. According to exchange regulations, all sales must be completely absorbed at the settled price. Therefore, the brokers had no choice but to be unable to settle the price. It is heard that the United States is willing to purchase 2 million ounces at a price of 28.375 pence, 0.375 pence lower than yesterday, while the sales orders received by the brokers totaled 5 million ounces. According to reliable news outside the silver market, most of the sales were for forward transactions, about 12 million ounces, while there were very few buyers of forward transactions.

<h3>Statement from the US Treasury Department Denies Abandoning the Silver Purchase Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) A spokesperson for US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau criticized the collapse of the London silver market today and denied that the US Treasury Department had abandoned the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act. Morgenthau is not in Washington, but the situation in the silver market has been reported to him in detail. According to the opinion of London brokers, the collapse of the silver market was due to the US not purchasing. The spokesperson for the US Treasury Secretary stated that the US authorities have repeatedly stated that they faithfully fulfill the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act, but it should not be forgotten that the Secretary of the Treasury previously stated that the US Treasury Department's monetary policy is based on a 24-hour basis. There has been no clear statement from official circles, so no one can say how long the US Treasury Department will remain outside the world silver market. State Department personnel are unwilling to criticize the claim that the US government's silver purchases are related to the Sino-Japanese situation. Congressional silver party members claim that they have not received news about the overall situation, but feel that the Treasury Department's actions do not indicate a permanent change in the US silver policy, and that the current situation is only temporary in nature. Someone suggested that the Secretary of the Treasury should specifically convene journalists to explain the silver situation. Undersecretary of the Treasury Ganston replied that there was no need to convene journalists specifically to discuss the silver situation. The Treasury Department is still fulfilling the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act and does not want to discuss the development of the world silver market or the strategies that the US needs to adopt to cope with this situation on a daily basis. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury officials are still unwilling to criticize the silver issue today. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau did not go to the department this morning, but people in the Treasury Department claimed that the Secretary of the Treasury had very good information about the world silver market. The Secretary of the Treasury then arrived at the department, but did not want to discuss silver policy with journalists. However, a Treasury Department spokesperson stated that we are still implementing the Silver Purchase Act, but do not want to discuss the content of the plan or its current status. Washington is speculating about the relationship between the US silver purchase plan and the current world market. The US withdrew its silver purchase orders from London yesterday, and the London market completely stalled as a result today. There are widespread rumors here that the Treasury Department's position is as follows: (1) The Treasury Department is negotiating directly with China to purchase China's silver reserves. (2) The Secretary of the Treasury decided to exert great pressure on London in order to punish speculators. (3) The Treasury Department heard that a large amount of silver was being smuggled from China to Japan, and therefore stopped purchasing silver on the world market. Officials learned that the silver flowing from China to Japan in November was three times higher than in November 1934. It is said that the Treasury Department had previously promised to provide China with methods to improve the silver purchase, so as to minimize the damage suffered by China. (4) China sells silver in order to increase foreign deposits in US dollars and British pounds in order to stabilize currency prices, but the amount of sales exceeds the US's ability to absorb it. (5) The European war machine is gradually disappearing, and the United States cannot continue to buy silver without causing an unexpected surge in the British pound. For this reason, the Treasury Department suddenly terminated silver purchases. Financial observers with good information here believe that this statement is the most reliable. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Impact on China's Monetary System</p>
<p>(New York) Today, some quarters here believe that the US Treasury Department's move to stop buying silver is the result of China's currency reform, believing that the plight encountered by the London silver market is due to China's large-scale sale of silver in London in order to obtain foreign exchange and stabilize its currency prices. The current difficulty for the US government is whether the US should raise silver prices to benefit the governments of Nanjing and Hong Kong. Senator Thomas made a statement in Washington today on this matter. Thomas was one of the leading figures in the silver purchase bill. He told guests today that the current silver market situation is the result of Britain wanting to control the world and linking China's currency to the British pound, which is detrimental to the United States. Britain sent Sir Ross to China, and Ross advised Nanjing that it would be best for China to adopt a managed currency system linked to the British pound, sell silver, and purchase gold. Thomas also said that they have been sucking us for a long time, and now uncovering their inside story is beneficial to the silver market and the United States. Therefore, the United States' suspension of silver purchases is indeed the right approach. Why should we help Britain solve China's problems, which will benefit Britain and harm the United States? From the standpoint of future stability of the world's currencies, the collapse of the silver market is an excellent thing. No one was buying in the New York silver market, and the price of foreign silver could not be set early today, but the final price was 63.75 cents, down one cent. The stock market opened erratically today due to panic caused by the silver situation. Later, the prices of various stocks were weak, especially metal stocks and railway stocks. The number of shares traded today was 2,341,000. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Observations of London Newspapers</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News commented on the chaotic state of the silver market, saying, "The chaos in the silver market, what is the reason? It is impossible to speculate now, because the US government has not revealed its intentions at all. However, whether the silver policy has been ineffective in practice at the current stage, it is difficult to believe that the US government intends to abandon it entirely. The US government believed that raising silver prices could restore the purchasing power of the people of the Far East, but its expectations were completely inaccurate. This was proven long before China announced its new currency policy and abolished silver coins." The newspaper's conclusion raised the question, "Is the US move today a step to achieve the same purpose as in the past? Or is the entire concept of the silver policy wrong, and has President Roosevelt, who advocated this policy, begun to realize that the original view was misguided?" (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong Not Affected</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reliable estimates, the Hong Kong Treasury currently has 85 million yuan in silver reserves, because the issuing banks have handed over all their ready cash to the Treasury. All the cash is in silver coins, and the number of large silver bars is very small. This morning, the world silver situation did not have much impact on the Hong Kong market, except that speculators bought US$550,000. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to information obtained by our correspondent, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart visited Prime Minister Laval late at night after the British Cabinet meeting yesterday and held talks. The discussions focused less on the content of the joint Anglo-French proposal and more on the impact of the proposal on the sanctions policy. In other words, if the Anglo-French proposal is accepted by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini but rejected by the Emperor of Abyssinia, should the oil embargo be implemented against Italy? It is generally believed that the British Cabinet believes that the solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute must be accepted by the League of Nations and approved by both parties. Therefore, if Abyssinia rejects the Anglo-French proposal, the oil embargo should still be implemented. Prime Minister Laval, on the other hand, is eager to avoid Italy's reaction to the implementation of the oil embargo. Therefore, he advocates that if the Emperor of Abyssinia rejects the Anglo-French proposal, he should bear part of the responsibility for the failure of the peace talks. Therefore, sanctions measures should not be tightened. (10th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Any Suggestion to Reward Aggression Unacceptable to the Abyssinian Government; Preferring Resistance to Ceding Territory for Peace; British-French Plan Submitted to Both Parties; League of Nations Sanctions Committee to Meet Today</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the Abyssinian government has notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating, "The Abyssinian government deems unacceptable any solution to the dispute that rewards the aggressor." The notification further stated that the reason Abyssinia waited until the last minute to issue a mobilization order and prepare for war was due to the request of the British government. Abyssinia is now "willing to fight to the end and will never accept such a solution." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The Emperor, upon learning of the proposed solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute by British and French diplomatic authorities, immediately stated that Abyssinia would oppose any attempt to cede even a single foot of territory to the aggressor. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini is expected to issue a response tonight regarding the British-French reconciliation plan, expressing considerable approval. The British-French plan has been submitted to Prime Minister Mussolini by French Ambassador Chambrun and British Ambassador Drummond successively. Thus, the gloom that has hung over Rome for months has suddenly seen the dawn today. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, it has been confirmed here that after Britain and France discussed and revised the peace plan agreed upon in Paris by the British Foreign Secretary and French Prime Minister Laval through diplomatic channels, the British government has expressed satisfaction with the peace terms. British Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Vansittart, accompanied by British Ambassador to Paris Clerk, visited the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to discuss the plan. When leaving the ministry, when approached by reporters, Vansittart replied, "We have reached a compromise."</p>
<p>The revised peace terms were telegraphed to Rome and Addis Ababa (the Abyssinian capital) last night. It is widely believed that the British government has requested the French government to explicitly announce that this proposal must be accepted by Italy, and also by Abyssinia and the League of Nations. Subsequently, a compromise satisfactory to the British government was reached. According to French sources, the revision agreed upon by both parties involves a significant reduction in the amount of land in Tigray Province ceded to Italy. The rights enjoyed by Italy within the land designated for Italian immigrants have also been revised, and the land remains under the sovereignty of the Abyssinian King. It is said that the British government considered the original terms to be too favorable to Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) According to what our reporter has learned, the points the Cabinet insists should be modified in the Hoare-Laval joint proposal are not of great importance. According to the new plan proposed by the Cabinet: (1) The area of Tigray Province ceded to Italy is smaller than in the original plan. In addition to Aksum, the "holy city," the district of Adigrat will also continue to be held by Abyssinia. (2) The zone in southern Abyssinia proposed to be permitted for Italian colonization should be managed by an Italian company. This company should be organized under a special license from the Abyssinian Emperor and supervised by a representative of the League of Nations. Furthermore, according to what our reporter has learned, the Cabinet insists that the modification of Abyssinian territory (i.e., the cession of Tigray Province to Italy and Abyssinia's acquisition of an outlet to the sea on the Red Sea coast) must be in the nature of a territorial exchange, so that Britain can avoid the suspicion of rewarding an aggressor. Figures in the Foreign Office believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will accept the plan proposed by Britain and France, but the Abyssinian government will certainly reject it, as can be clearly seen from the Abyssinian government's note to the Foreign Office tonight.

<h3>Reconciliation Amendment; Britain and France Reach Complete Agreement; Formally Submitted to Both Parties</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval announced today that the British-French plan to mediate the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has been submitted to the governments of Italy and Abyssinia today. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) After the closest consultation between London and Paris by telephone, the British Cabinet approved the British-French plan to reconcile the Italo-Abyssinian dispute tonight. It is said that the main sticking point was a procedural issue. Britain insisted on submitting the plan to the League of Nations first and then notifying Italy and Abyssinia, but Laval rejected this.

<h3>Eden and Laval Travel to Geneva Together; Sanctions Committee to Meet Today</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Sanctions Committee will meet as scheduled tomorrow. It is said that France is advocating for a postponement, but Britain disagrees. It is expected that the British-French peace proposal will be discussed at tomorrow's meeting, but a concrete resolution on this matter is still far off. The plan will likely be transferred to the Sanctions Adjustment Committee or discussed at the League of Nations Council meeting next Tuesday. Eden is scheduled to depart for Geneva tomorrow via Paris. Regarding the proposed oil embargo against Italy, Russia, Romania, the Netherlands, Siam, Finland, Iraq, India, Ceylon, Argentina have not yet responded. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare have agreed on a solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the question of what procedures the League of Nations will adopt remains unresolved. Laval will travel to Geneva tonight in the same car as British Minister Without Portfolio Eden. The two will discuss this issue on the train. At the same time, the Chairman of the League of Nations Council's Five-Nation Committee, Spanish representative Madariaga, is also on the train. Therefore, Laval and Eden will also be in contact with Madariaga. It is generally expected that the Eighteen-Nation Committee will delay discussion of the kerosene embargo on the grounds that Britain and France are conducting mediation, and will conduct negotiations with the relevant countries under the auspices of the League of Nations, based on the plan agreed upon by Britain and France in Paris. As for the Council's Five-Nation Committee, it was originally an organization responsible for mediation, composed of representatives from Spain (Madariaga), Britain, France, Poland, and Turkey. Previously, the recommendations put forward by the committee on September 18 were not accepted by Italy, causing it to stall until now. Now, it should continue its work to complete its success. In addition, the countries participating in the sanctions are all suffering because of the implementation of sanctions. When the above-mentioned negotiations begin, they will naturally feel that the shackles are lessened and can take a breath. However, the restoration of normal relations between those countries and Italy will only be possible after the proposals of Britain and France are accepted by Italy and Abyssinia. In short, the proposals agreed upon by Britain and France this time are sufficient to show that the two countries have made their best efforts to mediate the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Their concessions to Italy have reached their maximum limit, and their political possibilities cannot be increased further. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Sacrificing the Weak to Create Peace; Nothing Less Than a Death Knell for the League of Nations; Criticism from the Soviet Press</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A Soviet observer believes that Britain is preparing to recognize the peace proposals of French Prime Minister Laval because Japan has repeatedly invaded China, so it does not want to be constrained by other matters in the Mediterranean, Africa, and Europe. Pravda said that if the League of Nations succumbs to British pressure and sacrifices Abyssinia to achieve this peace, then the British-French peace plan will become the death knell for the League of Nations.

<h3>Eden Answers Questions in the House of Commons; Clarifies British Policy; Peace Proposals Based on Three Principles</h3>
<p>(London) Minister Without Portfolio Eden answered questions in the House of Commons today regarding the Labour Party's criticism of the peace plan to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, stating that the British government still adheres to the principle that any peace proposal must be accepted by Italy, Abyssinia, and the League of Nations before it can be implemented. Labour Party spokesman Smith declared that if the rumored peace plan is even half true, it violates the principles of the League of Nations and abandons the position the government relied on in the recent general election. Eden responded, reiterating the British government's policy and emphasizing that the Paris proposal is only the first step in a long and complex undertaking. This proposal is based on three major principles: (1) the exchange of land, beneficial to both Italy and Abyssinia; (2) League of Nations assistance to Abyssinia to promote social, economic, and administrative development; (3) special facilities for Italian expatriates and Italian companies involved in Abyssinia's economic development. As for the peace terms reported in the newspapers, most are extremely inaccurate, and the rest are contradictory. The current content of the proposal cannot be made public because it is unprecedented to publish the content before it has been sent to the League of Nations or the countries concerned. We have never said that any party must accept this proposal, nor do we want to impose conditions on others. Our responsibility is to consult with the countries concerned to see if we can obtain a basis for peaceful negotiations to proceed. If this proposal violates the principles of the League of Nations, then the League of Nations should judge it to be incompatible, and we will obey the League of Nations without complaint. Eden continued, "I will go to Geneva tomorrow because the British government's policy is still based on its membership in the League of Nations. I will consult with representatives from many countries to jointly determine the best way to maintain the authority of the League of Nations." (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the government's response to King George V's address, after days of debate, the House of Commons finally passed the resolution by a majority of 281 votes to 139. Beforehand, Labour Party members had questioned the government, and Prime Minister Baldwin answered and concluded the debate, saying, "Regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, we have never intended to act alone, nor do we intend to do so today. Although Minister Without Portfolio Eden will report to the League of Nations Council on the solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute agreed upon by the British and French diplomatic authorities, if the League of Nations Council does not adopt it, then Eden will be powerless to implement it, because Eden will find it difficult to force Italy and Abyssinia to accept this plan, and we do not know what decisions the countries concerned will make. However, if our efforts to mediate this time still yield nothing, then we must try again in the future. As for the consequences that the implementation of sanctions may cause, we must reconsider the entire problem. When we talked about the kerosene embargo, we originally thought it was simple and easy, but who knew that the complexity of the matter was extraordinary, because if we want to do something, we must ensure that the embargo can have a practical effect. Otherwise, empty talk will not help. In short, we will soon tell the gentlemen of the House of Commons all the experience we have gained from this mediation of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. At that time, the House of Commons and the national people will also consider what can be done in the future to advance the work of the League of Nations Council. That is all I can say to you tonight. In short, the policy we are currently following is completely consistent with the one we have always pursued. We are still responding to the League of Nations Council and following its lead, but we will never cross the line, because we only have two paths to follow: to fully assist the League of Nations Council or not to assist it at all. We must know how to choose between the two." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Egyptian Independence Movement</h3>
<p>Cairo The National Party and the Liberal Party, in demanding the restoration of the 1923 Constitution, recently held a meeting of the leaders of the two parties as planned and drafted a petition to request the King to directly restore constitutional government.

The treaty is roughly as follows: (1) Recognize Egypt as an independent and autonomous country. (2) Guarantee British transportation in Egypt, including the Suez Canal. (3) Britain protects Egypt from foreign aggression. The nationalist faction is now willing to give up British insistence on sovereignty over Sudan. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Advises Matsuoka to Carefully Develop North China</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) South Manchuria Railway President Matsuoka visited Finance Minister Takahashi this morning at 11 o'clock, reported on the current situation of "Manchukuo" and South Manchuria Railway, and explained South Manchuria Railway's capital plan, coal liquefaction, and other new businesses for about an hour. The Finance Minister generally understood South Manchuria Railway's sound fiscal policy.

After the meeting, the Finance Minister said that Mr. Matsuoka is good at talking and had heard various conversations, but had not yet heard a concrete plan, so he planned to meet with him again. According to Matsuoka, there is no unease in Manchuria. Regarding new businesses, unless a thorough investigation is conducted, it is unlikely that Matsuoka will start to proceed.

<h3>Japan Insists on Equal Demands; Naval Conference Heavily Reefed; Japanese Representative Explains Reasons; Atmosphere at Meeting Not Good; Britain and America Form United Front; Harmony Unprecedented</h3>
<p>(London) When the Naval Conference resumed this afternoon, Japanese Chief Delegate Admiral Nagano again explained the reasons for Japan's demand for naval equality, and the atmosphere at the meeting became particularly unpleasant. It is generally feared that a setback is imminent. The various delegations are now considering ways to salvage the failure. Reuters has learned that the opinions of the British and American representatives on naval limitations are in greater harmony than at any time in the past twelve months. All parties are now conducting tentative discussions, intending to grant Japan equality in principle within the scope of the Gentlemen's Agreement to preserve its prestige, but it will contain the nature of a tiered clause to prevent Japan from invoking it when it is actually building ships close to the level of Britain and America. This method will not be proposed at the meeting until discussions on a common higher limit prove to be a failure. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) When the Naval Conference resumed this morning, it was reported that the spokesman for the British delegation, Jellicoe, extended the principles of the Washington and London Naval Treaties and made amendments appropriate to the changing international situation and the needs of each country.

US Chief Delegate Davis reiterated the proposal to reduce the navy by 20% and said that the United States is prepared to explore any reasonable proposal. The conference will not reconvene until tomorrow afternoon, so that British Naval Minister Monsell can attend the cabinet meeting today. There will be noteworthy developments at tomorrow's meeting, as it is heard that the Japanese representative intends to explain in detail Japan's demand for naval equality.

<h3>So-Called Common Maximum Limit; Britain and America Ask Japan to Fully Explain</h3>
<p>(London) At the meeting of the First Committee of the Naval Conference yesterday, the representatives of Britain and the United States asked the Japanese representative to provide a more detailed explanation of the claims made by the country. According to what our reporter has learned, the Japanese representative will provide an answer when the First Committee continues its meeting this afternoon. There are several questions that the British and American representatives have raised to Japan: (1) Does Japan's so-called "common maximum limit" mean that the navies of weaker countries should be expanded to the level of the major naval powers, or should the forces of the major naval powers be reduced to the level of the weaker countries? In other words, does the method advocated by Japan aim to increase or decrease the forces of each country? Because so far, the Japanese representative has not provided any figures. (2) If Japan insists on requiring the navies of weaker countries to be expanded to the level of British and American forces, then Britain and the United States are eager to know whether Japan is prepared to announce its future shipbuilding program and whether this shipbuilding program intends to reach the level of the British and American navies. (3) Japan has not fully explained the reason why it believes that the balance system stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty, which was considered appropriate in 1921, has been considered inappropriate since 1930. In addition, there are two points that Britain and the United States also want to understand, namely (a) whether the so-called "common maximum limit" applies equally to all naval powers; and (b) whether it applies to all types of warships. Since the representatives of Britain and the United States raised the above questions, some parties believe that no matter what method Japan's demand for naval equality takes, Britain and the United States will firmly oppose it at tomorrow's meeting, because this demand of Japan is not acceptable to Britain and the United States. The reason for asking it to explain it is to prove its unacceptable nature, so that it can be rejected in whole or in part. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Stance is Reasonable and Consistent</h3>
<p>(London) The Japanese delegation to the Disarmament Conference held a meeting yesterday to discuss the explanation policy of Japan's claims at the first committee of the Disarmament Conference on the 11th. The results decided are as follows: (1) Regarding the right to equality of armaments, Japan's request to set a common maximum limit is a matter of course from the perspective of national dignity, but it is not only proposed because of adhering to dignity, but is based on the need to establish a national defense strategy and put forward a concrete request. Therefore, the proposal to nominally recognize the right to equality but actually reduce the amount of possession is absolutely opposed. This point is made with the extreme force of argument, given that there are claims abroad that demanding the right to equality is only a matter of face (1) The reason for demanding the right to equality, as stated at the exhibition, is to establish the principle of ideal disarmament, not threatening and not aggressive. Those who truly do not want to cause war in the world should be able to understand this reason. Naval power is free to move and does not threaten or invade, and it must be based on equal rights. (1) If the nations recognize Japan's claim, they are prepared to propose a numerical proposal for the common maximum limit of military strength, and its level must be kept low, and it is decided that this conference must make it a landmark conference in the history of disarmament. (1) The positions of Britain, America, Japan, France and Italy are different. The Japanese representatives are most concerned about the large reduction of high-level armaments. (1) During the transition period before the common maximum limit is realized, if it is long-term, the result will be to allow the ratio to be maintained during the period, so Japan cannot agree to the abolition or large reduction of offensive weapons, and it must be carried out in the short term. As for the discussion of numbers, it belongs to the public judgment of the meeting. For example, if its period is ten or fifteen years, it is actually too long. (Denstu Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3>Naval Treaty Expires Next Year; Japanese Navy Prepares for Major Maneuvers</h3>

<h3>Belgian Airplane Accident; Wing Icing Caused It; Eleven Passengers Died</h3>
<p>(London) An airplane carrying passengers, flying from Brussels (the capital of Belgium) to London, crashed near the signal station of the Tatsfield-Bickley Airfield in Kent, England. A total of eleven people died, including seven passengers. The famous British designer of the Carden aero engine, Sir Carden, was also among them. It is now believed that the cause of the crash was icing of the wing. People near the crash site saw the plane flying low, its nose suddenly pointing downwards, and the fuselage turning over. The pilot apparently tried to ascend, but one wing touched the treetops of the Rutsy Hill. The entire plane was then destroyed, and the broken parts were scattered hundreds of yards around. The plane belonged to the Belgian Sabena Airlines, and it is said that the Belgian government is its main shareholder. The pilot and three other crew members were all Belgian. In addition to two British passengers, the remaining dead were two German men and women, and one Belgian. Other people nearby said they heard a huge shock at the time. They ran from their homes to the crash site and saw that the plane had been destroyed. They then moved out the bodies of several victims, one of whom was a woman whose limbs were incomplete. The bodies of the remaining people had fragments of the fuselage inserted into them. In addition to designing the Carden aero engine, Sir Carden was also known for designing army tanks.

<h3>The Dream of Philippine Independence Rapidly Diminishes: An Article Published by Famous American Reporter Howard</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the opinion of Howard, director of the Howard newspaper chain and the American United Press, after the expiration of the autonomous government of the Philippine Islands in 1946, from the perspective of the Filipinos themselves, they will not be completely independent. Zhen, who is currently in Manila, published an article today stating that the dream of Philippine independence has rapidly diminished.</p>
<p>The issue of independence has been the biggest point of contention in Philippine political circles for 35 years. However, less than a month after the establishment of the autonomous government, it has reached a dead end. The Philippine Republic stipulated by the Independence Act and demanded by political leaders seems impossible to realize anywhere.</p>
<p>The expansion of the Japanese army, with the ambition to engulf the entire Far East, now casts a shadow over the entire Philippines. Therefore, the biggest political goal of the Filipinos has shifted from independence to seeking the safety of the freedom they have already obtained. The value of this safety has increased sharply, so the first step is to seek it under the American flag. The Filipinos do not want Japan's "Asian Monroe Doctrine," because this Japanese phrase is equivalent to "Asia for the Japanese."</p>
<p>Howard believes that if the situation does not change, in a few years, the US Congress will "be asked to make the autonomous government a permanent system, and determine its political and economic status as a territory. At the same time, the Filipinos have also begun to prepare to promote the commercial potential of the Philippines to the American political and business circles. Once the political status is determined and free trade between the Philippines and the United States is guaranteed, the economic mutual benefits will be unlimited.</p>
<p>The current anti-Philippine attitude of American workers can be eased by strict immigration laws. If Congress is afraid that Filipinos will cause trouble after joining, it can be stipulated in advance that they cannot be changed to a state system. If this propaganda still fails to arouse the interest of Americans, then the business leaders of the Philippines bluntly stated that they will ask the autonomous government to contact the United Kingdom and be willing to be a British colony. Britain would naturally welcome this proposal, because the Philippines is not only economically developed, but also can strengthen Britain's position in the Far East. If it unfortunately falls into the hands of the enemy, it will endanger Britain's entire position in China.</p>
<p>The above situation described by Howard is the opinion he collected from visiting the entire island and talking with leaders from all walks of life for a month. As for the general public, Howard said that they still cannot understand the situation in all aspects. They only know that after independence, they will be able to eliminate the chronic problems, and now they have practically achieved the goal of independence.</p>
<p>Therefore, they have deep faith in the current leaders. However, people who lead public opinion and are highly educated, except for some political figures, mostly admit that if the Philippines cannot be economically independent and lacks adequate national defense, there is no political independence to speak of. Even most political figures also admit that with the strength of the Philippines alone, it cannot achieve economic and national defense independence. However, they are limited by their positions and cannot publicly express it.</p>
<p>The Filipinos believe that their change of policy is not contrary to the policies of other countries related to the Pacific. Since Japan defied the League of Nations and invaded the Asian continent, the Far East policies of various countries have changed. When Washington and Manila considered the issue of independence in the past, they always believed that political independence and territorial integrity could be guaranteed by treaties. Now, judging from the situation in China, it has proved that this kind of guarantee is of no value in the Far East. Therefore, in addition to the surprise of the United States and the Philippines, the Filipinos also believe that changing the policy is not a breach of faith. Moreover, the Filipinos believe that the abandonment of independence is caused by forces that the Filipinos cannot control, because the Philippines is not willing to withdraw from the United States unless it is given a definite guarantee. At present, the American side has little understanding of all the resources and business opportunities in the Philippines, and is also unwilling to have more disputes overseas. Therefore, the Filipinos only hope that the United States will not force the Filipinos to accept independence only in name after giving independence to the Filipinos, and hope that the current nationalism in the United States is only a temporary conservatism caused by the recession. In the future, once the economy recovers and American business redevelops overseas, it will still retain the American market, and the Philippines will not be regarded as an exception. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Quezon's Written Response</p>
<p>(Manila) President Quezon today gave a written reply to Howard's report, declaring that he has sworn to abide by the Philippine Constitution, which stipulates the independence of the Philippines in 1946. In any case, our responsibility to create a nation is to strive to make us self-reliant and self-sufficient in all aspects in a very short period of time. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Attention of the US Army Authorities</p>
<p>(Washington) Army Department authorities today stated regarding Howard's views on Philippine independence that any action to make the Philippines a part of the United States must first be passed by Congress. The Army Department pays close attention to Howard's views, but cannot directly criticize them because it has not received official notification. However, it is said that Howard's statement is a clear report of the original views on the Philippine issue. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Congressmen Express Their Opinions</p>
<p>Congressmen generally believe that the permanent US affiliation movement of the Filipinos will cause economic problems, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Roughly speaking, the sugar, vegetable oil, and milk industries will continue to demand complete separation, while the textile, automobile, and machinery manufacturing industries will support affiliation. Observers said that geographically, agriculture is distributed throughout the country, and congressmen representing rural areas have always been able to win. Senator Tydings declared that he doubted that Congress and the American people would agree to maintain the status quo in the Philippines. The United States has allowed independence for 35 years, and the Filipinos' demand for complete independence has not stopped. Last winter, he went to the Philippines specifically to inform the Filipinos of the difficulties after independence. He warned them about this matter. Then the Philippine Congress passed the Constitution, which was finally approved by the United States, and then held elections, and the autonomous government was established. Regarding the facts stated in Howard's report, Tydings said that he did not believe that Japan intended to take the Philippines, and the Filipinos decided on their needs. A spokesman for the American Federation of Labor said that he believed that most Filipinos hoped for complete independence. A spokesman for the American Farm Bureau also said that the Filipinos had already accepted independence, and the Farm Bureau would not participate in the movement to change that policy. Senator Franci said that he felt that the Filipinos' request for independence should be recognized. Congressmen who participated in the founding ceremony of the Philippine autonomous government should be able to determine the future attitude of Congress towards the Philippines. Senator McClay said that if the United States cannot manage the Philippines' foreign affairs, army, navy, air force, customs, immigration, and issue of national debt, he does not approve of a permanent autonomous system. He opposed granting independence after visiting the Philippines and reported this to the Senate. He firmly believes that an independent government will not defend its country, but if the United States abandons all property and control of the island, he feels that it is better to withdraw completely. If we should not control the important parts of the Philippine government after the transition period, it is better to let the Filipinos take care of themselves. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Sterling-Dollar: The London foreign exchange market this morning still felt the repercussions of the silver market turmoil. The price of sterling continued to weaken against the dollar and the French franc, as there was concern about a lack of dollars if the United States decided to stop buying silver. However, around noon there was a firm atmosphere. The opening price of sterling-dollar was 4.92125, lower than the US-UK closing price yesterday by 0.001875. In the first hour, it fell by 0.000125. At noon, it continued to fall by 0.00025 to 4.9204375. In the next hour, the trend turned firm, rising by 0.000125 at one point to 4.9205625, after which there was no change.</p>

<p>US Silver: The Mountri silver market opened lower by more than 200 pounds, because the London market still has no US purchases, and the Bombay silver market has weakened again.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>US Cotton: Although the Liverpool cotton market was stable, the New York cotton market opened down several pounds. People's hearts were disturbed by the white silver storm.

Fertilizer sales have been very large recently.</p>
<p>Sterling Cotton: The price in the Liverpool cotton market did not change much, as merchants are awaiting the results of the US Supreme Court's actions. At 1:00 PM, the price for the January term was 6.37, up three pounds.</p>
<p>Sterling Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market opened stable this morning, expressing sympathy with foreign markets. However, trading was lighter after the transaction, and the price fluctuation was small, because merchants are waiting for the outcome of the white silver situation. There are no new features in the market. At 1:00 PM, the price for the December term was 5 shillings and 11 pence 625, lower than the closing price yesterday by 0.0025. Corn was also firm, with the price rising by three pence.</p>
<p>US Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened slightly lower, and then fell slightly again due to the low Liverpool telegrams, the instability of the silver market, and the improvement of the European political situation. The miscellaneous grain market was stable, with prices close to yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The London rubber market situation was stable this morning. The April-June term opened unchanged, with the price at 6 shillings 4375. At noon, it rose by 0.0625 to 6 and a half pence.</p>
<p>New York: New York rubber opened up several pounds due to better London telegrams. After the price increase, the price stabilized due to purchases by colleagues.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: The New York stock market opened mixed and lower, with metal stocks being particularly loose. After a period of instability, the market progressed vigorously, and most stocks rose above yesterday's closing price. Automobile, department store and public utility stocks were stable.

<h3>Political Committee for Hebei and Chahar Provinces: Definite Establishment Process</h3>
<p>Powerful Japanese Figures in Beiping and Tianjin Have Agreed; Committee Member Candidates Await Central Government Decision and Announcement</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The measures for dealing with the situation in North China have been discussed repeatedly by Chen Yi, Xiong Shihui, Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, and others for days. Internal opinions only reached a consensus on the evening of the 5th. Xiao went to Tianjin on the morning of the 6th to negotiate with powerful Japanese figures in Tianjin. It was not until the 7th that the agreement of powerful Japanese figures in Beiping and Tianjin was obtained. Thus, the measures for stabilizing the situation in North China could be determined. On the 8th, the situation took a sharp turn for the better. It is reported that the organization of a "Political Committee for Hebei and Chahar Provinces" has been finalized in Beiping, with one chairman and several members. He Yingqin and Song Zheyuan have reported the situation to the Central Government.</p>
<p>The proposed location for the Political Committee for Hebei and Chahar Provinces is the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs during the Beiyang government era, which was previously the site of the Reorganization and Political Council. After the Central Government issues a clear order for its establishment, organizational regulations will be drafted. The area under the committee's jurisdiction will include Hebei and Chahar Provinces, as well as Beiping and Tianjin Municipalities. The nature of this committee is important in two aspects: (1) In name, it must absolutely not break away from the Central Government to maintain national sovereignty; (2) It must adapt to the local environment to stabilize the current situation. Currently, both the Chinese and Japanese sides have agreed to these principles. In the future, in addition to establishing various departments or sections, the committee will also hire individuals familiar with East Asian affairs to serve as consultants.</p>
<p>The establishment date of the Political Committee for Hebei and Chahar Provinces has not yet been determined. The initial decision was to have 19 members, but on the 9th, it was changed to 15. After discussions that night, it was increased again to 17. The list of members has also been telegraphed to the Central Government and will be announced after being approved by the first Central Political Conference on the 11th. There are some discrepancies between the names of the committee members announced by the Chinese and Japanese sides. The Chinese side announced the following: Chairman Song Zheyuan, members Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen, Wang Yitang, Liu Zhe, Jia Deyao, Li Linyu, Hu Yukun, Gao Lingjue, Xiao Zhenying, Qin Dechun, Zhang Zizhong, Cheng Ke, Zhou Zuomin, and Men Zhizhong, totaling 15 people. The Japanese side's announcement did not include Jia Deyao and Li Linyu but included Li Tingyu. According to Li Linyu, he has not had any contact with any party on this matter; it may be a mistake for Li Tingyu. Li Linyu is the president of Sino-French University, while Li Tingyu is a former subordinate of Wu Peifu who once served as the governor of Henan Province. The Japanese announcement also included Qi Xieyuan and Xu Songming. Xu is the president of Beiping University. According to sources close to Xu, Xu has refused to serve as a member, and if his name appears, he will submit his resignation. Shang Zhen told reporters that he had not been informed of his appointment as a member of the Political Committee for Hebei and Chahar Provinces and will not take the position. The affairs of the Hebei Provincial Government have been concluded and can be handed over at any time. The 32nd Army under his command will be returned to the Central Government. In the future, he personally wishes to travel abroad to broaden his knowledge.</p>
<p>The Political Committee for Hebei and Chahar Provinces will internally establish three departments: Secretariat, Finance, and Political Affairs. Each department will have sections, and each section will have groups. If necessary, a secretary-general may be established in the future. After the committee members are announced, they will be assigned to the two departments to work. The staff of each department will be transferred from those who previously served in the Military Sub-Committee and the current Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying went to Jurentang at 9:00 AM on the 10th to meet with He Yingqin to discuss everything. After meeting with He, Qin and Xiao took a car to the Summer Palace to meet with Song Zheyuan.</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, came north with He Yingqin earlier to deal with the situation in North China. Now that things are generally settled, he felt the need to report to the Central Government urgently, so he left Beiping by train at 3:05 PM on the 10th to return to Nanjing. (10th)</p>
<h3>Student Parade in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>—Expressing Sympathy for Students in Beiping—</p>
<p>A visitor from Hangzhou reported that in response to the demonstration by students in Beiping against the autonomy of North China, Zhejiang University students convened a joint meeting of over 400 students at 9:00 PM last night (the 10th) and resolved to: (1) Send a telegram in support of the demonstration by university students in Beiping; (2) Send a telegram to all schools across the country to respond in unison; (3) Contact students from various schools in Hangzhou to form a propaganda group to promote opposition to North China's autonomy to the public. The propaganda team of Zhejiang University students went to designated locations at 7:00 AM this morning (the 11th) to carry out propaganda. Later, upon reading reports that the demonstration by students in Beiping on the 9th resulted in a bloody tragedy, representatives from secondary and higher schools in Hangzhou were urgently convened at 10:00 AM for a meeting. It was decided to hold a large parade at the Hubin Sports Field at 2:00 PM this afternoon to oppose all autonomous organizations in North China that falsely claim to represent the will of the people. The representatives returning to Hangzhou notified the students of their respective schools to participate. The meeting began at 3:00 PM, with over 10,000 students from Zhejiang University, Advanced Institute of Technology, Advanced Institute of Agriculture, Art Academy, Chinese Medicine Academy, Zhijiang University, Hangzhou High School, Hangzhou Junior High School, Municipal High School, Girls' High School, Hongdao School, Huixing School, Girls' Vocational School, Zhongshan School, Finance School, Feng's Girls' High School, and other schools in attendance. Representatives from each school formed a presidium to determine the meeting's proceedings and elected Shi Eryi as the temporary chairman. He reported the purpose of the meeting and the situation in North China, stating that the students of Hangzhou were united in support of the government. The students then shouted slogans and began their parade, departing from the Hubin Sports Field, passing through Yingzi Road, Sanyuanfang, Jianqiao, Minquan Road, Xinmin Road, Dongjie Road, Yanjiao, Zhong'an Bridge, Yanling Road, Hubin Road, and then gathering again at the Hubin Sports Field to disband. They shouted slogans along the way, and the order was very good. Military and police authorities dispatched teams to maintain traffic. At 8:00 PM, an ad hoc meeting of representatives from various schools was convened to discuss sending telegrams to support and comfort the dead and injured classmates in Beiping and to organize a joint student organization in Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>Provincial Inspectors Come to Songjiang One After Another</h3>
<p>In order to inspect the administrative status and progress efficiency of various counties, the Provincial Government specially dispatched inspectors Shen Yong, Ning Bojin, and Ke Bojin. After completing their inspection in Nantong, they transferred to Songjiang on the 10th and met with County Magistrate Li at the County Government. They then stayed at the Xin Songjiang Society. Inspector Ning focused on the baojia system and accompanied the first district office for inspection on the morning of the 11th, and set out to randomly check the baojia. The county's inspection of the police force was originally scheduled to be held in Kunshan District. However, the provincial department considered winter defense to be important and it was not convenient to transfer troops, so the inspection was stopped. Therefore, Inspector Ke was dispatched to undertake the mission of inspecting the police security team of the Public Security Bureau. Inspector Ke, accompanied by County Magistrate Huang Zhifang, inspected the headquarters of the 12th Security Brigade and its subordinate teams, as well as the internal affairs of the Public Security Bureau on the afternoon of the 11th. At 2:00 PM, he gathered the soldiers of the security team and the police of the Public Security Bureau at the public sports field to be inspected by Inspector Ke. Ke gave a public speech with many words of encouragement. Inspector Ning, accompanied by Huang Zhifang, Section Chief of the County Government, hired a car to go to Sijing to inspect the baojia. It is reported that they still need to go to Fengjing and other places for inspection on the 12th before returning to the province to report.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Fake Son of an Official Escorted to Yixing for Investigation</h3>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, a young man named Yu Feihe came here. Because he claimed to be the son of Yu Jingtang, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, the Public Security Bureau heard about it and welcomed him to the city, opened a high-end hotel for him, held a banquet to wash away the dust, and sent people to guide him to tour the mountains and rivers. After three or four days, there were no flaws. Unexpectedly, when examining Yu's photo, the matter was revealed. The young man then admitted that his surname was Chu. His family was notified, and his mother, Wang, came to Changshu to take him back. The bureau insisted on having him post bail, which was delayed for three days. Until the 10th, his mother found a store to provide a guarantor and was completing all the procedures. Unexpectedly, the Department of Civil Affairs called and instructed not to release him because the young man dared to impersonate the son of the Director. The newspapers everywhere have already published this, and Director Yu is very angry and instructed to escort him back to his original home in Yixing for investigation. Therefore, the bail could not be completed here, and his mother burst into tears. On the 11th, the five bureaus escorted him to the Yixing County Government.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Zhang Yipeng Goes to the Province to Request Collection of Rent</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Relief Institute, the Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, and the Warehousing Committee, because this year's rent collection has not improved, which has a great relationship with the overall finance and public funds, specially elected Zhang Yipeng as a representative to bring a petition to the province on the 10th to ask the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Finance to strictly pursue the rent. It is reported that the total public and private land rent in Wuxian is about four million, and the current income is less than one million, which is very different from last year.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: German Driver Runs Over and Kills a Village Child</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 AM on the 11th, two Germans, a man and a woman, were driving a black-plated car with license number 1480 from Shanghai along the Xihu Road to Wuxi. When they were traveling between the 19th and 20th bridges near Yangjianchang, A Rong, the ten-year-old son of Wang Longshi, a villager from Chao Dongxiang, was returning home from Yangjian Town. Because he failed to avoid the car in time, one of his legs was broken, and his head and chest were seriously injured. He died on the spot, which was unbearable to witness. Later, the family of the deceased came forward to negotiate. As a result, the Germans paid 60 silver dollars to settle the matter. The car that caused the accident immediately returned to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Theft, Arson, and Suicide Out of Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>Yang Bingcao, a warehouse clerk at the Bank of Communications on Jiangbei Wai Ma Road in this port, had been working as a cook at the home of Yu Runquan, the manager of the bank. In April of last year, with Yu's promotion, he transferred to the bank to work as a warehouse clerk. His wife, Song, had a daughter and lived on the upper floor of the Qiashun Restaurant at No. 67 Erheng Street. At about 2:00 AM on the 9th, Yang suddenly had a thieving heart. Taking advantage of the deep night and silence, he dug a hole in the wall of the manager's office in the bank and entered the vault, stealing 19,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars. He sneaked home and hid them in a small jar outside the room, covering it with firewood. After the incident, he poured kerosene on the mailbox and set it on fire, intending to destroy the evidence. After setting the fire, he rushed to the home of Xiang Shiyuan, a clerk at the bank, to report. At that time, Wu Qinhai, the chief of the fourth precinct, was on patrol and passed by the bank, catching sight of the flames inside the window. He immediately knocked on the door to warn them. The employees of the bank were awakened and rushed to put out the fire, which was quickly extinguished. Then, they found that a large sum of money had been stolen from the vault. They smelled the pungent odor of kerosene and knew that someone had done something wrong. They reported it to the captain of the detective team, who came to the bank to investigate and questioned the workers one by one. When they questioned Yang Bingcao, Yang panicked and falsely claimed that he had returned to the bank from a mahjong game on the Ningxing ship and discovered the fire. The detectives took him to the ship for questioning, and the matter was exposed. Seeing that the situation was bad, Yang jumped into the river and committed suicide while getting off the ship. The 19,000 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars he had stolen were found by the police in his home, without any loss. Yang's body had not been found as of the morning of the 10th.</p>

<h3>Shanghai University Federation Supports the Declaration of the Beiping Education Community</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Federation held an executive committee meeting at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 4:00 PM yesterday. Presidents from Jiaotong, Guanghua, Datong, Hujiang, Tongji, Daxia, and Fudan universities attended the meeting. It was resolved to send the following telegram to the national and Beiping education communities: (1) Telegram to the Beiping education community: Having read the declaration of November 24, we admire your advocacy of using all your strength to maintain the integrity of the country, your stern words, and your righteous arguments. North China is the hinterland of our country and the center of culture. Its survival and prosperity are related to the safety of the whole country. We unanimously oppose any attempt to divide it, no matter how cleverly it is disguised. We especially hope that the government will establish a policy as soon as possible and strive to maintain sovereignty, even at the cost of bloodshed and sacrifice. We and others are sworn to fight with you in unity. (2) Telegram to the national education community: The recent disturbances in North China have exceeded the limits of what we can tolerate. At this time, we must resort to the final force to maintain the integrity of the country. We are sworn to oppose any compromise solution and any administrative organization that could lead to the loss of land or sovereignty. The Beiping education community has already issued a declaration, and we hope that the national education community will work together to provide support.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Labor Union Sends Telegram Opposing North China Autonomy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union issued a telegram yesterday opposing the autonomy of North China, saying, "To newspaper offices, all party, government, and military agencies, all organizations, and all compatriots of the country: Our Republic of China is a country with complete territory, independent sovereignty, and does not allow anyone to use popular opinion as a pretext to carry out a conspiracy of secession and division to undermine the unity of the country. Nor does it allow any coercion or enticement to create puppet organizations to harm the independence of sovereignty. However, it has been reported in recent days that a so-called North China Autonomous Movement has occurred. The background of this movement is self-evident. However, a group of traitors are conscienceless, sick, greedy, and unrighteous, making all kinds of ugly appearances. This is extremely painful. The Beiping education community has repeatedly issued declarations exposing its conspiracy. On the 9th, students from various schools, unafraid of violence, resolutely gathered and marched to demonstrate their opposition to autonomy. This is enough to show that the people's hearts are not dead and the people's will is not extinguished. When the news came, we were extremely moved. At this time when the country's steps are difficult and hanging by a thread, we still hope that all compatriots will rise up in unison, gather the entire strength of the nation, oppose the existence of any pseudo-organization, so as to maintain sovereignty and protect the country. Our union is sworn to lead the 800,000 workers in Shanghai to act as a backing for the government. We hereby telegraph this to your attention. The Shanghai General Labor Union."</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Held a Farewell Banquet for Ke Nanning Last Night, Inviting Many Chinese and Foreign Guests to Accompany Him; Mr. Ke Still Plans to Come to China to Enjoy His Remaining Years</h3>
<p>US Consul General in Shanghai, Ke Nanning, is retiring and returning to his country. The mayor of this city, Wu Tiecheng, held a banquet at the International Hotel last night to send him off, and invited various diplomatic officials and Chinese and American business leaders in this city to accompany him. Those present were Al (Norwegian Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Breinan (British Consul General), Paul (Spanish Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Lahti (Swiss Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Ishisa Jotaro (Japanese Consul General), Nyaga (Italian Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Spielvink (Soviet Consul General), Mrs. and Dr. Elfes (Portuguese Consul General), Brac (Brazilian Consul General), Ciel (Danish Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Vega (Chilean Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Krinski (Polish Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Marks (Czech Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Niskalining (Finnish Consul General), Hartmannsdorf (Swedish Vice Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Blanrd (German Consul), Ostowen (Irish Consul), Mrs. and Mr. Videl (Cuban Consul), Mrs. and Mr. Okmuller (Austrian Consul), Fresco (Mexican Consul), Mrs. and Mr. Jannolaitos (Greek Consul General), Mrs. and Mr. Davis (US Consul), Mrs. and Mr. Lang (US Marshal in China), Miss Teetmen, Beaumont (US Marine Corps in Shanghai), Mrs. and Mr. Arnold (Commercial Counselor), Mrs. and Mr. Christosson (US Commercial Commissioner), Smith (US Assistant Commercial Commissioner), Mrs. and Mr. Rosset (US Acting Agricultural Commissioner), Jansenton (Municipal Council), Mrs. and Dr. Gail (Salt Revenue Advisor), Lockerte (Salt Revenue Advisor), Miss Lockhart, Mrs. and Mr. Young (Financial Advisor of the Ministry of Finance), Mrs. and Mr. Franklin (President of the American Chamber of Commerce), Miss Franklin, Mrs. and Mr. Button (President of the American Association), Stayer, Meyer Insurance Company, Mrs. and Mr. Magee (Citibank), Mrs. and Mr. Fitz (Western YMCA), Mrs. Finbo Lawbert, Miss Lawbert, Alman, Yu Hongjun, Geng Jiaqi, Cai Zengji, Xu Peihuang, Wu Zixiang, Zhang Tingrong, Tang Shixuan, and over a hundred other celebrities from all walks of life in our country. A Chinese-style banquet was used, which was very grand. During the banquet, Mayor Wu first stood up and gave a speech, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, US Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Ke Nanning, has served here for 17 years. Now he is retiring and returning to his country. Today, we respectfully hold this banquet to send off this 'good friend' who has been with us for many years. As we part, we cannot help but feel sad. The reason why we are willing to call Mr. Ke a 'good friend' is not just a casual expression of gratitude. Because Mr. Ke has been in China for a long time and has been sincere in his work, the term 'good friend' should be recognized by all of us. At the same time, the central government has recognized this and plans to award him a medal, which Mr. Ke can rightfully accept. Mr. Ke has been engaged in consular work for a total of 38 years, 22 years of which have been in China. Since being transferred to this city in 1919, Mr. Ke has always promoted sincere cooperation with the Chinese people and expatriates from various countries. For 17 years, he has been doing this every single day. It is no coincidence that Chinese residents in the concession can better understand and cooperate with the Municipal Council. Also, Mr. Ke's efforts have been very helpful in achieving satisfactory results in the abolition of the Mixed Court. Even when he is about to leave, Mr. Ke is still earnestly talking about Chinese and foreign cooperation, and has not changed his original intention for a single day. This is especially admirable. Confucius said, 'Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?' Therefore, since Mr. Ke has come to China all the way from the United States, it is even more delightful for us to have this 'good friend' who has cooperated with us for 17 years. Now that Mr. Ke is tired of his duties and wants to return home, we feel more lost than ever when he leaves. We can only express our enthusiasm and hope that Mr. Ke will be able to reunite with his old friends and enjoy himself after returning to his homeland this time. I would like to ask all the guests to drink a toast to wish Mr. Ke good health and a safe journey home." Then, Mr. Ke gave a thank-you speech. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until about 9:00 PM before dispersing. It is reported that after returning to his country, Mr. Ke will report to the US authorities and, after a short rest, will still have to come to Shanghai to enjoy his remaining years.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance: Crackdown on Private Hoarding and Sale of Silver Coins</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an instruction was issued to the money shops to establish measures for the crackdown; the Money Shop Guild has already notified all shops to comply.</p>
<p>The Industrial Society reports that the Ministry of Finance, considering the recent frequent occurrences of unscrupulous merchants privately collecting silver coins in the hope of selling and smuggling them abroad for profit, which has a significant impact on the monetary policy, issued a special instruction yesterday to the Shanghai Money Shop Guild to convene its members and instruct the cigarette and exchange businesses to convene their members to discuss and establish measures for cracking down on private hoarding and sale of silver coins. They are expected to comply conscientiously. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instruction</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instruction Qian Zi No. 2085 states: Since the implementation of the legal tender (fabi), the use of cash is prohibited, as has been widely announced by this Ministry. Recently, there have been instances of unscrupulous merchants raising prices to buy silver coins, hoping to sell and smuggle them abroad for profit. These merchants only seek private gain, disregarding the overall situation, and willingly break the law, which is extremely regrettable. This Ministry has also issued a general order to all political, military, police, and customs agencies to strictly investigate and punish them according to the law. It is understood that the members of the Guild and the cigarette and exchange businesses inevitably exchange silver coins in their business of exchanging silver coins and copper coins. However, they should follow the legal tender exchange procedures and promptly submit them to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications for exchange into legal tender for use, and should not hoard them privately. However, since there are many members in these businesses, it is inevitable that some may be tempted by private gain and hoard the collected silver coins privately, hoping to sell them, which constitutes illegal behavior. The Guild should immediately convene its members and instruct the cigarette and exchange businesses to convene their members to discuss and establish measures for cracking down on private hoarding and sale of silver coins to ensure compliance and protect the monetary policy. The agreed-upon measures should be submitted to the Ministry for review. This order is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Money Shop Notification</p>
<p>After receiving the order, the Shanghai Money Shop Guild issued a special notification yesterday to all shops that have not joined the association to comply. The notification states: "Respectfully, we received Ministry of Finance Instruction Qian Zi No. 2085, which states (original text omitted). Having received this order, we find that all member shops of this Guild are involved in remittance and exchange and do not engage in the business of subsidiary currency and exchange. All hard currency sealed after November 4 has been submitted to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. We will submit a separate reply to the Ministry of Finance and comply with the order to inform the cigarette and exchange businesses' guild to prepare measures. We hereby record and transmit the order. We respectfully request your shop to jointly agree with all non-member shops to properly establish measures for cracking down on private hoarding and sale of silver coins and reply to the Guild for transmission. This matter concerns a Ministry order, so we hope you will promptly discuss it properly."</p>
<h3>The Yinwei Loan Reduced to One Million Yuan; The Contract Will Be Revised After Negotiation</h3>
<p>The New Voice Society reports that the Yinwei loan signed by the Shaanxi Provincial Government on November 14th of last year amounted to a total of 1.5 million yuan, consisting of 450,000 yuan from the Central Bank, 350,000 yuan from the Bank of China, 250,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, 225,000 yuan from the Shanghai Bank, and 225,000 yuan from the Jincheng Bank. It was stipulated that the funds would be disbursed as needed for the project, with 200,000 yuan in the first phase from April to June of the 24th year, 600,000 yuan in the second phase from July to September, 400,000 yuan in the third phase from October to December, 250,000 yuan in the fourth phase from January to March of the 25th year, and 50,000 yuan in the fifth phase from April to June. Since the signing of the contract, the Yinwei project has not commenced according to the original dredging date, so no funds have been used.</p>
<p>Renegotiation and Reduction to One Million</p>
<p>Lei Baohua, Director of the Shaanxi Construction Department, now that the Yinwei Project Office has been established and the dredging project is about to begin, consulted with the Xi'an branches of the five banks that provided the loan, believing that the Yinwei project did not require 1.5 million yuan. It was decided to reduce the amount to one million yuan, using the entire revenue from the Jinghui Canal, Luohui Canal, Yinwei water levy, and the provincial business tax as collateral. The funds are to be used solely for the various expenses stipulated in the Yinwei Irrigation Project Plan and are not to be used for other purposes. The monthly interest rate remains at eight percent. The lenders will nominate two representatives to serve as members of the Shaanxi Water Conservancy Expenditure Management Committee, and a special auditor will be appointed to audit all income and expenditure related to the loan.</p>
<p>Contract Revised with a Term of Five Years</p>
<p>The Xi'an branches of the lending banks telegraphed their head offices in Shanghai for approval. The revised loan contract was formally signed on the 9th, with terms similar to the previous one. It was stated that the Yinwei loan contract signed on November 14th of the 23rd year of the Republic of China was void. The five lending banks nominated the Bank of China as the chief representative, disbursing funds as needed for the Yinwei project, without specifying a deadline or amount. The loan term remains five years. After the completion of the Yinwei project, it will be named the Weihui Canal.</p>

<h3>Treasurer's Report: Summary of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Financial Situation</h3>
<p>Land tax and license revenues have declined significantly; this year's projected surplus is approximately 300,000 yuan; the Police and Public Works departments lead in cost-cutting; the future may be even more difficult than the past.</p>
<p>The Finance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently held a meeting to discuss the accounts of the various departments of the Council for the first nine months of the year, ending in September. At that time, the Treasurer of the Municipal Council made an oral presentation on the financial situation of the Council. The minutes of the Committee meeting were reviewed at yesterday's regular meeting of the Council. The details of the Committee's discussions are excerpted below.</p>
<p>In his report to the Finance Committee, the Treasurer stated that although the accounts of the various departments of the Council had been submitted, some points related to the summary of the results must be pointed out. Under the ordinary budget, there was a surplus of 1,823,533 yuan up to the end of September, and the projected surplus for the whole year was 35,810 yuan. However, this figure would not accurately reflect the actual financial situation until the end of the fiscal year. For example, on the revenue side, the full amount of the land tax for the year has already been included, while on the other hand, the utility fees for various public utilities under public and municipal services have not yet been included because they are settled semi-annually. In addition, the total municipal rate and the extra-Settlement roads special rate under ordinary revenue were approximately 563,000 yuan less than projected for the first nine months of the year. The reasons for this are approximately (1) fewer new buildings than in previous years, (2) lower rents, and (3) more vacant properties. The revenues from the wharfage dues and license fees have also decreased. However, it is gratifying that the shortfall has been more than offset by the cost-cutting measures in the expenditures of various departments.</p>
<p>The Treasurer then, at the request of the Chairman, gave a more detailed oral presentation on his submitted report. He stated that the purpose of the compilation of the financial report for the first nine months of the year was to inform the various departments and their affiliated committees of the expenditures that have already been confirmed for the first nine months of the year so that they could be more prudent in their expenditures in the remaining months of the fiscal year, and to allow a preview of the results of the year's operations. Regarding municipal revenue, the city has suffered greatly from the impact of the widespread economic downturn. The sources of revenue, such as land tax, license fees, and other revenues, are far below expectations, as mentioned above. However, the increase in vacant properties and the decrease in new buildings seem to be showing signs of improvement compared to the past. According to his estimate, the total revenue from various sources for the year will be approximately 1.25 million yuan less than budgeted last year.</p>
<p>As for ordinary expenditures, according to the Treasurer, the expenses of various departments in 1934 were reduced by approximately 1.1 million yuan compared to the budget due to austerity measures. However, the austerity measures taken by various departments this year have been even more stringent than last year. Therefore, according to the statistics compiled by various departments, the amount saved is approximately 1.6 million yuan, excluding the expenses of the Telephone Special Committee, which are approximately 93,000 yuan. The largest source of these savings is the Police and Public Works departments. Of course, the savings from other departments are also considerable. In the Police Department, the number of foreign personnel and prison personnel is 44 less than the quota. Other parts of the department have also taken similar austerity measures. There are also many similar situations in other departments. As for the Public Works Department, the total amount of savings is second only to the Police Department. However, the department implemented austerity measures earlier than other departments. Major construction projects, such as road construction and improvement, and other activities, can be temporarily suspended. However, if other departments want to reduce expenses effectively, they must start by laying off employees. The Treasurer also stated that the heads of the Public Works and Police departments, and the heads of other departments, have cooperated fully in these cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>The Treasurer said that the most important aspect of the expected outcome of this year's ordinary budget is to find ways to achieve a surplus. According to his estimate, after setting aside appropriate reserves, the surplus for the year will be approximately 300,000 yuan. Last year, the projected surplus was 360,000 yuan, while the actual surplus was approximately 700,000 yuan. Considering the unprecedented difficulties faced this year, if this result can be achieved, it can be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the budget for 1936, if there is a surplus this year, it will have a substantial impact on the budget carried over to the following year. In the opinion of the Treasurer, the difficulties ahead will be far greater than those experienced in previous years. If the municipal taxes continue to be levied at the current rate of 14%, the initial deficit will reach a huge 3.5 million yuan. This year's ordinary budget has already been reduced significantly compared to last year, and next year's budget will inevitably be even tighter than this year's. However, this is related to public works. If austerity measures continue indefinitely, the final result will be a decline in efficiency and a deprivation of social well-being. Furthermore, the projected surplus for this year refers to the balance after the allocation from the reserve fund, while the initial deficit of 3.5 million yuan for 1936 mentioned above refers to the balance before the allocation from the reserve fund. The amount of the deficit will naturally be reduced after the reserve fund is used. During the Finance Committee's discussions, one of the members mentioned the foreign staff of the Municipal Council's remittance allowances. The Treasurer also made some remarks regarding the calculation and handling of the allowances.</p>
<p>Regarding the extraordinary revenue and expenditure accounts, the Treasurer stated that at the beginning of the year, the construction expenses proposed by the various departments had been reduced to the lowest possible level. Even at the ratepayers' meeting, the Chairman had indicated that the construction expenses in this year's budget were much lower than last year's. The projects that were already underway and had to be completed, and the road construction that had to be carried out, accounted for almost the entire budget. However, although the budget had been reduced to the lowest possible level, thanks to the strong cooperation of the Director of the Public Works Department, the actual expenditure of the department was still able to be reduced significantly, by approximately 1.5 million yuan. The suspension of various construction projects was expected. However, given the financial difficulties this year, the benefits of this move should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>As for the sources of funds for the various construction expenses, the issuance of municipal bonds was impossible. Therefore, it was necessary to slightly increase the overdraft on the temporary sterling accounts and sell some assets at favorable prices to meet the expenses. Furthermore, the mortgage terms for the 1933 Shanghai Telephone Company loan were very favorable. The company had already repaid 1 million yuan in installments at the end of June of this year, and an equivalent amount would be repaid by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Council's debts, the Treasurer mentioned the 6% municipal bonds of 1925 and 1926. The Treasurer stated that at the beginning of the year, he had been instructed by the Board of Directors to agree with the bondholders' trustees that the repayment of the 1925 bonds would be postponed because the maturity date was still 20 years away. Given the current situation, it would be useless to repay these two types of bonds according to the initial repayment schedule stipulated in the trust deed, i.e., by December 31 of this year and the following year. Furthermore, the trust deed had previously been amended to give the Council the right to manage the fund for the repayment of the bonds and to allow a grace period of five years in order to avoid the need to immediately deposit cash to await an uncertain need. However, this arrangement does not harm the interests of the bondholders because the bonds can be redeemed at any time after the first optional repayment date with six months' notice. The timing of the redemption will depend on the financial and bond market conditions and whether it is in the Council's interest. It is not appropriate to sell its assets on a fixed date to repay the debt. The future course of action will depend on the future financial situation. According to the arrangement that he had agreed upon with the trustees, the debt repayment fund should be extended for another five years so that the total amount of the debt repayment fund can reach 5 million yuan. However, as mentioned above, the interests of the bondholders will not be affected, and there will be no conflict with the Council's right to choose the date of redemption. Therefore, the arrangement that he had agreed upon with the trustees should be approved by the Committee.</p>
<p>The members of the committee expressed their agreement with this move.</p>
<p>The Chairman then discussed the issue of various allowances for Municipal Council personnel and said that the Treasurer should be asked to report on the current austerity measures and future policies at the end of the year. The Treasurer said that the matter had been thoroughly investigated and that he would report on the outcome at a later date. However, in his opinion, this matter is very complex and requires consideration of both economy and fairness, and is closely related to the satisfaction and efficiency of current contract employees.</p>
<h3>The Huiping Vessel Has Been Missing Since Leaving Haizhou; An Investigation Is Underway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Huaitong Company's Huiping vessel left Haizhou for Yantai five days ago and has not been heard from since. It is possible that the vessel encountered a storm and took refuge, resulting in its disappearance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Five Days Without News Since Leaving Haizhou</p>
<p>The Huaitong Shipping Company, located at 44 Guangdong Road, has a large shipping business in North China, with Yantai as its base. Its Huikang, Huichang, and other vessels operate in the Beiyang region, while the Huiping vessel also operates between Zhifu and Haizhou. The Huiping vessel left Haizhou fully loaded with cargo this time, bound directly for Yantai. Normally, it should arrive in 36 to 48 hours, but it has been several days without any news. The company is very worried and has telegraphed Haizhou to inquire and telegraphed the Shanghai office to inquire about the vessel's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Whether to Avoid the Wind, Various Parties Inquire</p>
<p>After receiving this news yesterday evening, the reporter inquired with various parties and learned that the Huiping vessel had indeed left Haizhou fully loaded with miscellaneous goods and has been missing for five days. It is still difficult to say whether it has gone missing. After consulting with Director Tang Danhua of the China Ship Insurance Association, it was stated that the Huiping vessel had indeed left Haizhou and has not been heard from since. There has been fog and strong winds on the sea in recent days. It is possible that the vessel is taking refuge elsewhere. The vessel does not have wireless equipment, so communication is more difficult. The China Ship Insurance Association has an insurance policy for it of 30,000 yuan. In addition to reporting to the Insurance Association, Huaitong Shipping has sent telegrams to various places to inquire about the vessel's whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Ningjing Escapes Danger and Passes Wusong</h3>
<p>The Vessel Ran Aground Due to Heavy Fog Near Jiangzikou, But Fortunately Escaped Danger and Passed Wusong as the Tide Rose</p>
<p>The Ningjing vessel of Ning Shao Company, with a load of 1,693 tons, originally operated in the Yangtze River ports. Recently, it was leased to Haizhou to load salt and transport it to the Yangtze River ports for unloading. The vessel arrived at the Jiangzikou sea area at 5:00 AM on the 10th of this month. Due to the fog, navigation was difficult. At that time, the vessel ran aground on a shoal near Jiangzikou. Because it was heavily loaded with salt and had a deep draft, the captain's attempt to free the vessel was unsuccessful. He telegraphed Shanghai for assistance. The company was planning rescue measures when they received another telegram from the vessel yesterday afternoon, saying that fortunately, the tide had risen greatly in recent days. During the high tide on the night of the 10th, the captain took the opportunity to put the engine in reverse and free the vessel from the shoal. There was no need to send a rescue vessel. It was expected that the Ningjing vessel would pass Wusong at 3:00 PM on the 11th and enter the Yangtze River.</p>

<h3>Telephone Metered Billing: Negotiations Between the Two Concession Authorities Stalled</h3>
<p>The Continental Press reports that the compromise between the French Concession Board of Directors and the Public Concession Works Department regarding the new telephone metered billing system has encountered difficulties. It was learned yesterday that the French authorities are still negotiating with the Public Concession authorities regarding several points in the telephone experts' report that the French side is dissatisfied with. However, the French authorities are unwilling to disclose the nature of these points. According to unofficial sources, these points are all minor. The Board of Directors continued to meet on the 1st of last week to discuss these points, but no agreement was reached. Therefore, the negotiations have apparently stalled. However, even if an agreement is reached, the matter is still controversial because the Shanghai Telephone Company has stated that the fees set in the telephone experts' report are still too low and should be revised to be closer to the 10% profit allowed on invested capital under the operating concession.</p>

<h3>Opening of Zhabei Soup Kitchen: Request for Municipal Government Funding Assistance</h3>
<p>Poor people are suffering from hunger and cold, urgently needing relief. The Social Affairs Bureau forwards the request to the Municipal Government for review and approval.</p>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Organization, due to the increasing number of poor people, is complying with orders to prepare for winter relief by opening a soup kitchen. We respectfully request that the Municipal Government approve and allocate funding. This is a special report to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The report states that on the 22nd of last month, the Bureau issued instruction No. 2920, which briefly stated that due to the severe floods in various provinces this year, businesses and industries are exhausted, and the poor are struggling to find food and clothing. The situation this year is unique, and the organization is required to prepare for providing soup and other relief efforts early. In response to this order, the Zhabei Charity Organization recognizes that Zhabei is a gathering place for coolies and poor people. Every winter, we open a soup kitchen, and the elderly, weak, and children flock to it for food, often numbering in the hundreds. In this cold winter, a bowl of hot porridge is enough to extend their lives. Moreover, due to the economic downturn, many people have lost their jobs. Many factories, large and small, in Zhabei have frequently stopped operations, and even silk factories are mostly shut down due to a lack of raw materials. The sight of the general poor and suffering people, hungry and cold, is heartbreaking. We have no choice but to open the soup kitchen early to save these starving and freezing people. We plan to quickly repair the stoves, cauldrons, and houses at the No. 2 Soup Kitchen on Liuying Road, fearing that the freezing weather will hinder us. It is noted that the Zhabei Charity Organization has been allocated over two thousand yuan from the municipal government's revenue every winter to fund the soup kitchen. Last year, the mayor ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate one thousand yuan for relief. It is certain that the number of poor people eating porridge at the soup kitchen for half a year will be numerous, no less than in previous years. Furthermore, due to the state of the economy, it is difficult to raise donations. We earnestly request that the mayor, who loves the people like his own children, show compassion for the many suffering people and provide special relief. We believe that the Director of the Bureau is deeply concerned and spares no effort in relieving the poor. Therefore, we specifically submit this report, earnestly requesting that you review it and quickly forward it to the mayor, who will promptly order the Finance Bureau to allocate two thousand yuan annually for relief, so that we can open the soup kitchen early and save the hungry and cold, suffering people. We await your urgent instructions. Respectfully submitted to Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has already submitted the report to the Municipal Government based on the situation.</p>

<h3>Dismembered Body of a Child Discovered on Qimei Road</h3>
<p>At 7:50 AM yesterday, the dismembered body of a child, about two or three years old, was discovered inside a bamboo fence west of the Guangzhou Leather Factory behind the temple on Qimei Road, east of Zhabei. Only the upper half of the body was found, severed neatly below the chest, seemingly cut off with a knife. Therefore, it was impossible to determine the child's gender. The body was discovered by Liang Wanquan, a worker at the factory, who was quite surprised and immediately reported it to the Linping Road Police Station. Police were dispatched to investigate and confirmed the report. A crowd gathered to watch, with some speculating that it was the child of a migrant worker who died of illness, and out of superstitious fear of reincarnation, they resorted to this cruel act. Others speculated that it was a small hostage who was killed after negotiations broke down. Opinions varied and no conclusion was reached. In the afternoon, Xu Jinlin, the local bailiff, reported the case to the local court, requesting an autopsy.</p>
<h3>English Consulate Police Court Continues Hearing: Case of Two Police Officers Throwing a Chinese Man into the River; Police Car Driver Testifies to Witnessing the Incident; Unwavering Testimony Despite Repeated Questioning by Lawyers</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin News, Peters, a Western police officer from the Ji Jiaxing Road Police Station in the Public Concession, and Jute, a probationary police officer, are accused of throwing a beggar named Mao Debiao (transliteration) into the Hongkou River on December 1st, causing bodily harm. Mao died in Renji Hospital on Friday morning of last week. An autopsy the following day confirmed that he died of pneumonia, which was aggravated by being immersed in water. The case was first heard by the English Consulate Police Court last week, as both defendants are British citizens. The court reconvened yesterday morning (the 11th) to continue the hearing. Four witnesses were called to testify, including two Chinese police officers, one Chinese clerk from the police station, and one Russian police officer. First, Chinese police officer No. 1728 testified that he saw a sick beggar on Xinji Bang Road on the morning of December 1st and reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. Thirty minutes later, he returned to the spot, but the sick beggar was gone. He also stated that the beggar he saw at Renji Hospital did not look the same as the one he had initially seen. Next, Chinese clerk Yuan testified that his duties at the police station included recording events and answering the phone. Around 2:45 AM on December 1st, he received a report from Chinese police officer No. 1728 about a beggar lying on the side of the road and recorded it in the register. Police officers Peters and Jute were in the room at the time, and Chinese police officer No. 3067 drove them out of the police station. Yuan further identified the text he had written, but stated that the additional note below, "Arrived, beggar had left," was not in his handwriting but was written by Peters. The hearing continued at 2:15 PM in the afternoon. The Russian police officer was called to testify. His testimony was very brief, stating only that Peters initially ordered him to go and detain the beggar at the police station but then said that he (Peters) would go himself. Next, the police car driver, Chinese police officer Du No. 3067, who drove Peters and Jute to Xinji Bang Road to collect the beggar that day, testified. The police officer was questioned by the lawyer for over two hours but remained steadfast in his testimony. He firmly stated that on that day, he drove the two police officers to their destination. The two got out of the car and went into the alley, then brought a beggar back. The beggar was placed horizontally on the running board, and Peters also stood on the running board. They then drove to the middle of Feilun Road at the intersection of Yalu Road and Youheng Road. The two police officers ordered him to stop. Peters then grabbed the beggar's right leg and right arm, while Jute grabbed the left leg and left arm. They walked to the riverbank and threw the person into the river. Prosecutor McNair immediately questioned Du to get the truth. Du replied that this was what he had seen with his own eyes. Defense lawyer Rickes also questioned Du, but Du remained steadfast in his testimony, stating that after the beggar fell into the river, he shouted wildly. Because he did not leave the car, he did not see whether he landed in the water, only heard his cries. Rickes continued to ask why he did not report the truth after returning to the police station. Du replied that the two were his superiors, so he could not do that. He only explained everything when he was questioned by the police inspector on December 2nd. After Du finished his testimony, the court adjourned and scheduled the next hearing for Saturday morning.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Students to Study in Siam: Departure by Ship Tomorrow</h3>

However, they must first learn Siamese. The duration of their studies is estimated to be five years.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Murder of Indian Money Lender: Judge Personally Inspects the Scene</h3>
<p>To ensure that no innocent person is wronged and no guilty person is let off. Sentencing scheduled for the 17th.</p>
<p>The home of Nusek Singh (transliteration), an Indian money lender who lived upstairs at 1033 Rue Foch (now Yan'an Middle Road), was suddenly stormed by four armed robbers at around 7:00 AM on October 15th. His wife, Pi Sheng Tieke (transliteration), was shot and killed by the robbers when she tried to stop them, and they fled without looting anything. Nusek Singh, seeing his wife shot dead, disregarded the danger and chased after them, calling for the police. Detectives arrived and gave chase. Because the robbers fired shots along the way to resist arrest, one robber was shot dead in front of No. 9 Route Magy (now South Maoming Road) in the French Concession. A pistol was seized, and a suspect named Li Guoxiang (32 years old, from Jiangbei, living at No. 4 Guba Road, working as a rickshaw puller) was arrested and taken to the police station. Because the victim identified Li as one of the robbers at the scene, the police sent Li to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After several court hearings presided over by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, the defendant vehemently protested his innocence and presented evidence to the contrary. However, because the victim insisted that the defendant was at the scene of the robbery, the court ordered a postponement for further hearing. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Presiding Judge Zhang, for the sake of caution and to ensure that no innocent person is wronged and no guilty person is let off, notified detectives from the French Concession Police Department to accompany the defendant to the victim's home for on-site inspection the day before yesterday. They also went to No. 9 Route Magy, where the robber was shot dead, to investigate and ordered him to demonstrate what happened. They returned to the court after two hours. At noon yesterday, Judge Zhang came to the Criminal Division to continue the hearing. The plaintiff and defendant still testified as before. After the court appointed a lawyer to defend the defendant, it announced the conclusion of the hearing and scheduled sentencing for the morning of the 17th. The defendant remains in custody awaiting instructions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Monk Sues Russian Newspaper: Case Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 18th</h3>
<p>The foreign monk Zhao Cen, previously represented by lawyers Lin Yingqing and Shu Shengmin, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Lin Bich, publisher of the Russian-language "Chai La Evening News" at 774 Avenue Joffre (now Huaihai Middle Road), and editor Weiss (female) of defamation. On August 3rd, the newspaper published news that Zhao Cen had incited the Yi people to start a war, supplied the Yi army with weapons in disguise, served as a military scout for Abyssinia, and had been expelled from Europe in the past. He requested investigation and prosecution, and also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for reputational damage of 10,000 yuan. After two court hearings presided over by Judge Sun Pengham, the defendants, defended by lawyer Jiang Guofang, claimed that the news was reprinted from a Latvian French-language newspaper and that an editor's note had been added at the end stating that Zhao Cen had been seen in Shanghai a week earlier. The court ordered a postponement, instructing both parties to go outside and mediate and ordering the defendants to submit the original newspaper and other evidence. The details were reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, the hearing was continued. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. After the court questioned both parties, it ordered the debate to begin and then announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling sentencing for 9:00 AM on the 18th.</p>
<h3>Legal action for Inheritance Claims against Concubine of Li Jingfang</h3>
<p>Yesterday, evidence was taken from a witness, and Li Jiaxing and others must still be summoned for questioning.</p>
<p>Li Jingfang (Zi Bohang), the former Qing Dynasty minister, died in Dalian last autumn. Before his death, he wrote a letter of instruction regarding the distribution of his family property to his children and grandchildren to avoid disputes over property in the future. After his death, his concubine, Ms. Wu, learned that the letter stipulated that she would receive 23,000 yuan for her old age. This spring, she requested the money from Bohang's eldest son, Guo Tao, grandsons, Jia Ji and Jia Xing, and Zhou Mengwen, the witness in the letter of instruction, but has not received a penny to date. Ms. Wu hired a lawyer, Zuo Detou, and filed a lawsuit for embezzlement against Li Guotao and the other three, which has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui held a court hearing. Except for Li Jiaxing, who has tuberculosis, the other defendants were all present. The witness, Li Guoxiao, though suffering from hemiplegia for a long time, followed the summons and arrived at the court in a hired car, with his driver crying. Because he could not stand on his own feet, Judge Liu allowed him to speak from inside the car during his testimony. First, the plaintiff, Li Wu, stated the facts of the lawsuit, saying that the old master (referring to Jingfang) stated in the letter of instruction that she would receive 23,000 yuan for her old age, but it had been embezzled by the defendants. Therefore, she was filing a lawsuit. She was 25 years old when she became a concubine, and followed them to Dalian in 1927. Last March, she returned to Shanghai first due to illness, and the old master passed away in September. The defendants did not tell her, so she only heard the news this January. The old master told her before his death that if something happened to him, she could ask Guotao for her old age money. But when she asked for the money she was due, Li and his sons first claimed they did not know, then said she had already taken it. In reality, she only learned about the letter of instruction from others. Defendant Li Guotao testified that his late father's letter of instruction was written in the presence of his children, grandchildren, and concubines. His father personally handed over the property to each person, and the plaintiff's money was also received at that time. Li Jiaji's testimony was similar to Guotao's. At this time, the plaintiff's attorney, upon learning that the defendant Zhou Mengwen would be questioned, requested that the defendants be separated to ensure impartiality. The court then ordered the two Lis to wait outside the court and questioned Zhou, warning him not to favor any side. Zhou agreed and testified that he is currently the manager of the Liji Shipping Company in Wuhu and has long had friendship with Li Bohang. Li's property in Wuhu has always been managed by him. On December 24, 1932, Li wrote the letter of instruction disposing of his family property in Dalian, and he was also present. Therefore, Li asked him to sign the letter as a witness after the distribution was completed. However, the transfer of property took place upstairs, and he did not witness it. Judge Liu then compared Li Guoxiao's letter to Zhou and Zhou's reply with Zhou's testimony and made some discoveries. He then repeatedly questioned Zhou. Next, witness Li Guoran was questioned, who testified that he suffers from hemiplegia, but his mind is still clear. However, others think he has a mental illness. His father's letter of instruction was written in Dalian. Because he was ill, he was not present, so he did not know whether the plaintiff had received her money. This spring, the plaintiff came to him and said that she had not received the money she was due, so he wrote to Zhou Mengwen to inquire about it. Because the plaintiff often bothered him, he intended to mediate and have the six brothers each give 500 yuan, collecting 3,000 yuan to settle the matter. The court then scheduled a follow-up hearing for the afternoon of the 18th of this month, summoning defendant Li Jiaxing and witness Li Guohua to appear for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Major Fire on Hengfeng Road, Zhabei Last Night: Over Eighty Thatched Houses Reduced to Ashes; Three Men Burned in the Fire and Sent to the Hospital for Treatment; Whether There Were Fatalities Still Needs to Be Investigated Today</h3>
<p>There were approximately two hundred thatched houses for the poor at the intersection of Hengfeng Road and Yu Tong Road, Zhabei. At approximately 9:50 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the middle of the thatched houses. Because the thatched houses were close together, twenty or thirty houses were on fire within a blink of an eye. For a time, people shouted and order was in chaos. The general coolies rushed to salvage mats, bedding, and old clothes from the fire pits, fleeing in panic. The sidewalks along Hengfeng Road were all occupied by these people as places of rest. Fortunately, the Fenglu Police Station in charge was nearby, so upon receiving the news, they immediately notified the fire department to dispatch fire trucks to rush to the scene to put out the fire. However, because the weather was dry and the wind was strong, forty or fifty more houses were affected in less than half an hour. At that time, the flames soared and were unapproachable. Fortunately, the firefighters bravely put out the fire, preventing it from spreading further. The fire was completely extinguished at around 11:00 PM. As a result, approximately eighty thatched houses were burned down, and three men were found to have been burned in the fire. They were sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. However, it is not yet possible to determine whether there were fatalities, as it was dark, and the embers had not been extinguished. It is necessary to wait until work begins this morning before it can be clarified. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Appeals: Chen Bingwei Accused of Fraudulently Posing as a Doctor; The Circumstances Are the Same as Those of Lawyers Without Licenses; The Defendant Claims That There Was No Negligence in His Medical Practice</h3>
<p>Chen Bingwei, a 36-year-old Cantonese man, has not obtained a doctor's license or studied at any medical school, but claimed to be a doctor of medicine, specializing in venereal diseases, skin diseases, hemorrhoids, and other ailments. He set up a clinic at 613 Sichuan Road and falsely used the name of James Duncan, a professor at a certain medical college, to deceive patients. Recently, he was discovered by Dong Zhaobin, a Chinese detective from the General Inspectorate of the Public Concession, and was prosecuted in the First Special District Court for the crime of fraudulently obtaining property. After the trial, he was declared not guilty. During the appeal period, he paid a bail of 2,000 yuan. The Legal Department of the Municipal Council, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court through lawyer Ru Baoyi. Yesterday afternoon, Trial Judge Zhao Zhengchong, together with Associate Judges Zhou and Jiang and Prosecutor Lin, opened a criminal court to hear the case. First, lawyer Ru, representing the police department, stated the reasons for the appeal, saying that due to the special circumstances in the concession, the Provisional Regulations for the Amendment of Doctors could not be applied, resulting in unlimited restrictions on the qualifications of doctors. This has led to a general lack of medical knowledge, claiming to be doctors and hanging out signs to practice medicine, harming patients. It is not superficial. The defendant Chen Bingwei has neither studied at a medical college, nor has he obtained a license, but he claims to be a doctor of medicine and an expert in several diseases, and he also falsely uses the name of Duncan to dazzle people. To know a doctor, his skills must surpass that of a medical officer, and the patient must know whether the doctor has academic talent or is a doctor. The police department cannot use administrative sanctions to crack down on these swindling doctors, so they have no choice but to use judicial procedures to crack down on them. Moreover, the defendant's behavior is sufficient to constitute the crime of fraud under criminal law, but the original trial ruled him not guilty, which is difficult to accept. Therefore, an appeal is filed with your court, requesting that the original judgment be revoked and an appropriate sentence be imposed. Chen Bingwei's defense was that his brother graduated from a medical school in Guangdong and practiced medicine. He worked as an assistant for about ten years, so his skills and knowledge are very rich. Although he did not have a hot photo, it was said to be fraudulent, it has been several years, there has been no negligence, so please reject the police department's appeal. The police lawyer then cited that any lawyer who has not obtained a license and hastily performs his duties is willing to commit the crime of fraudulently obtaining property, so the situation in this case is actually the same. Finally, after mutual debate by the two lawyers, Prosecutor Lin Wo Peng rose to express his opinion, believing that the appellant was highly suspected of committing a crime and requested that he be punished according to the law. Trial Judge Zhao then declared the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<h3>Judge Convicted of Committing a Crime: Forging Official Documents; Sentenced to One and a Half Years</h3>
<p>Feng Jiasheng, 35, from Minhou, a clerk of the former Fujian High Court Prosecutor's Office, was ordered to temporarily serve as a student prosecutor at the Minhou Local Court. He was suspected of forging official documents in the case of Lin Kun suing You Buyun and his son for illegal detention and fraud and You Buyun suing Lin Kun for forgery and embezzlement. After the case was discovered, he was ordered to designate the Shanghai Local Court to handle the case. Prosecutor Ouyang Peng had investigated and confirmed that Feng's indictment summary in the Lin Kun case was inconsistent with the original indictment, which was obviously altered. He was prosecuted according to law. Wu Deying, the judge, had several trials, the details of which have been reported in previous newspapers. The trial was concluded again the day before yesterday afternoon by Judge Wu. Yesterday, the sentence was announced. Feng Jiaxing was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for altering official documents, and deprived of his civil rights for two years.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Broke into a Construction Factory at Night and Stole Hemp Bags, Exposed</h3>
<p>They Tied Up the Watchman and Threatened Him with Knives, Indian Police Patrols on the Street Led to the Capture</p>
<p>The Qiye Construction Factory, located on Connaught Road in Shanghai West, had a watchman because the factory contained goods and there was no work at night. The watchman, a Ningbo native named Yang Qingfeng, was hired to guard the premises at night. Around 3 AM yesterday morning, a gang of four, Wu A'gen, Lin Qiaosheng, Chai Shankang, Feng Guo, and others, carrying weapons, went to the factory. They first snuck in through the bamboo fence gate and stole 191 hemp bags of cement, throwing them out over the fence one after another. Unexpectedly, because the night was late, everything was quiet, and these people took a long time to throw the hemp bags, they woke up the watchman Yang Qingfeng. Just as he was about to investigate, the gang realized they had been discovered. Fearing their plan would fail, they decided to strike first. They rushed in, pulled out knives, and threatened him. They used ropes to tie Yang's hands and feet to the bed, and stuffed a cloth into his mouth, preventing him from making noise. Wu and the others were then able to calmly hire rickshaws to transport the hemp bags elsewhere. They also locked the door of the watchman's shed from the outside. Unexpectedly, two Indian police patrols, numbers 410 and 41, passed by at that moment. Seeing Wu and the others transporting hemp bags in the middle of the night, their actions seemed suspicious, so they went forward to question them. The gang was nervous and fled in different directions. Only Wu A'gen and Lin Qiaosheng were arrested on the spot. The others, Chai and Feng, escaped. The police then entered the factory, released Yang, and together with the stolen goods, took everything to the Gordon Road Police Station. At 9:30 AM, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted them according to Article 330 of the Criminal Code for robbery. Then, the watchman Yang Qingfeng filed a complaint about the previous events. When questioned, Wu and Lin confessed that the plan was conceived by Chai and Feng, who were still at large, and that they were only lookouts. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confession and ordered Wu and the others to be remanded in custody. The case was adjourned to next Monday for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Zhang Siyun, Who Specializes in Selling Partridge Vegetables, Sued</h3>
<p>The Plaintiff Accused Him of Breaching the Contract, the Verdict Was That the Defendant Was Not Guilty</p>
<p>The Hongxing Pharmacy is famous at the time for specializing in selling the children's medicine "Partridge Vegetables". Its head office is in Guangzhou. Recently, because business is booming, a Hongxing Pharmacy branch was established at 743 Nanjing Road in Shanghai, with Zhang Siyun as the manager. Now, Zhang was suddenly sued in the Criminal Court of the First Special District by the representative of Hongxing Foreign Firm, a Japanese man Takeuchi Heiten, and lawyers Huang Yuping and Huang Zengjie, for breach of trust and violation of Article 342 of the Criminal Code. They also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to order him to repay the security deposit of 2,000 yuan and the contract penalty of 50,000 yuan. The reason for the lawsuit was that the defendant Zhang Siyun had signed a contract with the plaintiff on April 24 of this year, appointing the plaintiff as the general agent for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the three Northeastern provinces, to sell "Partridge Vegetable" medicine for a term of five years. At that time, the plaintiff paid a security deposit of 2,000 yuan. Article 3 of the contract stipulated that the defendant should deliver 100,000 packages of "Partridge Vegetables" by August 15 of this year. Article 6 stated that if the defendant established a branch in Shanghai, the plaintiff's consent must be obtained. Article 7 stated that if either party breached the contract, they should compensate the other party with a penalty of 50,000 yuan. Now, the defendant established a branch in Shanghai without the plaintiff's consent, which was a violation of the contract and a criminal offense, hence the lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant was absent, and lawyer Jin Ximin appeared in court to defend him. The plaintiff's lawyer then rose and stated the above situation, saying that the plaintiff was currently away from Shanghai and could not attend the hearing, requesting a postponement. The defendant's lawyer, Jin Ximin, rose and said that even if the facts listed in the plaintiff's indictment were true, they were of a breach of contract and were entirely within the scope of civil matters. Moreover, the authenticity of the contract was questionable, and the seal on the contract seemed to be forged. Therefore, the defendant denied having ever signed the contract. However, the plaintiff knew this situation and had once filed a petition with the court on October 24 of this year, requesting mediation, which failed. Now, they suddenly changed their target and filed a criminal lawsuit, which was unreasonable and unjustified. They should request that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Wu reviewed the case and ruled that Zhang Siyun was not guilty, and the plaintiff's civil lawsuit was dismissed.</p>

<h3>The Pi Han Shelter Will Begin Receiving People, Charity Sends Letters Encouraging Support from All Sides</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation announced that the Pi Han Shelter will begin receiving people on the 26th. Yesterday, letters were sent to the Relief Committee, China General Edison Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Mainland Water Company, Merchant Shipping Association, Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association, Gold Industry, Securities Exchange, Gauze Exchange, Flour Exchange, Grain Exchange, and Lu Bohong, Gu Xinyi, Pang Yitai, and Ji Weilian. The letter stated: "The market is depressed this year, industry and commerce are sluggish, rural areas are bankrupt, and the number of unemployed civilians is increasing. In addition, after the floods in various provinces, disaster victims are flocking to Shanghai, without clothes or food, urgently needing relief. The Pi Han Shelter, which our association has organized for many years, should be held as usual. After several meetings, it was decided to start receiving people on the 26th of this month. If the weather is colder, it will be advanced accordingly. The Chaozhou Guild Hall at the South Railway Station will be used as the first shelter, and the Chao Huishan Villa on Xietu Road will be used as the second shelter. Once the two shelters are full, we will find more houses to expand. However, the Pi Han Shelter has no dedicated funds and relies entirely on donations. We have received donations and subsidies from you in the past, and your merits are immeasurable. This year, the number of people needing shelter will be greater than in previous years, and the need will be even greater. We sincerely ask you to donate generously to maintain the shelter. We would be grateful for your kindness. At this time of severe cold weather, poor people are suffering from hunger and cold. The Pi Han Shelter's expenses, in addition to the 2,000 yuan subsidy from the municipal government, are far from enough, as donations from various charities are still being collected. We hope that all sectors will donate generously. There is a great need for cotton clothing, blankets, and rice, which we hope can be sent to the Renji Hall so that the shelter can be established and start receiving people as soon as possible, which would be a great merit."</p>
<h3>Robbery in Dong'an Lane, Fangxie</h3>
<p>Zhou Songliang, who lived at No. 29 Dong'an Lane, Fangxie Road in the Nanshi district, returned home at about 9 PM the night before. Unexpectedly, just as Zhou entered the gate, two robbers following him also barged in. They both spoke with local accents, saying, "Please help us, Mr. Zhou." They then showed a gun to silence him. Only then did Zhou realize he was being robbed. He was shocked and speechless. The robbers began to search for valuables, taking 50 yuan in banknotes, 180 jiao in silver coins, an 80-yuan check from a certain bank, and a leather suitcase. They then left with the loot. Afterwards, Zhou reported the incident to the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation.</p>

<h3>Robbed Silver Necklace and Strangled to Death, the Juvenile Was Interrogated, Convicted, and Sentenced Lightly to 15 Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Gui Lin, the eight-year-old son of Zhou Qiu, a Taizhou woman who lived in a thatched shed in Zhoujiaqiao, west of Wusong Town, was playing in the nearby fields on the afternoon of November 14th. Ma Jinshan, a neighboring juvenile, noticed that Gui Lin was wearing a silver necklace. Ma, tempted by the sight of money, used a cloth strap to strangle Gui Lin to death. He then robbed the silver necklace and went to Laoshicheng Silver Shop on Songxing Road to exchange it for three yuan and six jiao. After Zhou Qiu, the deceased's mother, found out the above situation, she reported it to the police station in charge, who arrested Ma Jinshan and recovered the stolen goods. The Chuditou District Court Prosecutor's Office interrogated and detained him, and sent personnel to verify that Zhou Gui Lin had indeed been strangled to death. It has been reported in previous newspapers. Now, it is known that the case has been clearly investigated by Prosecutor Lei, and a public prosecution has been filed for murder. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan Zhuohong opened a court for trial and ordered Ma Jinshan to be brought to court. Ma Jinshan, who was 17 years old and from Taizhou, said that he was wronged. The official said, "You have confessed in the Public Security Bureau and the Prosecutor's Office. Today, you still want to deny it. You are young, but you are extremely cunning." After repeated questioning, Ma Jinshan confessed that he had been gambling and lost one yuan. He was being forced to pay it back, and he had no money to pay. When he saw Gui Lin wearing a silver necklace, he decided to steal it. He was afraid that Gui Lin would tell his mother, which would inevitably lead to negotiations, so he tightened the cloth strap around his throat. He said that he was too drunk that day and his nerves were confused, so he accidentally injured Gui Lin to death. He asked for leniency. The judge obtained the confession, considered the facts to be clear, and considered it to be the end. Yesterday, he ordered Ma Jinshan to be brought to court to announce the verdict. Considering that the defendant was still young, he was leniently sentenced to 15 years in prison as a warning. After the sentence was pronounced, he was taken into custody to await the execution of the sentence.</p>

<h3>The Radical Nature of the Rent Reduction Tide in Northern Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the false rumors occurred in Northern Shanghai last month, the residents moved away. Although some have moved back recently, they are only a small part of the sub-tenants, less than one-tenth of the usual number. In the neighborhoods north of Bazilu Road, only one-tenth or two-tenths of the sub-tenants remain. As for the sub-sub-tenants, there is not a single one left, and it is unlikely that anyone will rent there in half a year. The sub-tenants are overburdened, so on the 8th of this month, all the tenants of Yongfeng Lane, Heng'an Lane, Dade Lane, and Xinxiang Lane went to the Shanghai Northern Rent Reduction General Federation of the Zhongshan Fellow Association to hold a rent reduction meeting. The meeting was chaired by the two old gentlemen Peng. The meeting decided: (1) To send a letter to the owners of the four lanes to waive the rent for November and December according to the precedent of rent reduction; (2) To change the rent collection from January to 60% or 70%; (3) To send an official letter from the Federation to the owners of the four lanes for consent; (4) When necessary, gentlemen Zhuo and Peng will be sent to negotiate the rent reduction policy with the owners. All the official letters have been sent out yesterday.</p>

<h3>People Die of Cold</h3>
<p>The weather has been very cold in Shanghai in recent days, especially at night. It is said that many beggars on the street who are poorly clothed and fed are dying of cold every day. Yesterday, at the entrance of Yu's Temple in Laobaidu, Pudong, and at the corner of Xinyin Road, west of the North Railway Station Dayang Bridge, male corpses were found huddled together, clearly succumbing to the severe cold. Yang Zhenqing and Yao Liansheng, the local guarantors from each place, reported the matter to the local court, which sent personnel to identify the corpses and provide coffins.</p>
<h3>Fire on Foreign Ship, Fifteen Workers Injured</h3>
<p>The No. 1 dock of the Rui Rong Iron Factory at 640 Yangshupu is home to a foreign ship named Luo Youqin (transliteration), about 50 zhang long, with a capacity of over 10,000 tons. The ship was being repaired because of damage to the middle cabin. Yesterday afternoon, at about 4:50 PM, there was a sudden flash of electricity in the cabin, followed by thick smoke and an unstoppable fire.

<h3>Zhang Guinian's False Accusation Case Judgment, False Accusation and Forging Documents Result in Two Months in Prison, Manager and Clerk of Hua Sheng Factory Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Xin She Yun: Zhang Guinian, a clerk at the Ningbo Siming Bank, and his nephew Zhang Yanqing jointly opened the Yong Hua Sheng Sales Office last year. Zhang Guinian provided a 10,000-yuan bond to promote various electric fans from the Shanghai Hua Sheng Electric Factory. Later, the uncle accused the nephew of embezzlement and was involved in litigation in the Yin County Court. Later, due to a large debt owed to the Hua Sheng Factory, the factory filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai First Special District Court, and the defendant Zhang Guinian and Zhang Yanqing were jointly ordered to pay the plaintiff's debt of 6,645 yuan, 6 jiao and 7 fen, and interest at an annual rate of 5% from August 4, 1935, until the end of execution. The litigation costs were borne by the defendants. Zhang Guinian was not satisfied with the verdict and appealed, but was also rejected. He then intended to deny the debt and falsely accused the manager of Hua Sheng Factory, Ye Youcai, and the clerk Xu Qiaoqi, of forging documents. The court held a hearing on the 19th of last month. The defendants filed a counterclaim. The case was postponed due to the absence of the plaintiff. On the afternoon of the 10th, Xiao Xie Fen, a judge in the Criminal Court No. 2 of the Special District Court, heard the case. The counterclaimant and lawyer Cai Liu Cheng, and the plaintiff and lawyer Feng Mei Xue, arrived in court on time. After Judge Xiao carefully examined the case, the attorney Cai of the counterclaimant strongly refuted the plaintiff's misty accusation and stated the reasons for the counterclaim. He then declared in court that the counterclaimants Ye Youcai and Xu Qiaoqi were not guilty. Zhang Guinian was found guilty of false accusation and sentenced to two months in prison, suspended for two years.</p>
<h3>Two Fires in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Da Chang Xie Ji: The kitchen in the back of Da Chang Xie Ji Silk and Satin Bureau, No. 5 Xiaodongmen, caught fire at 7:40 AM yesterday morning because the chimney had been in disrepair for many years and was blocked by soot, causing the fire to spread upwards. At that time, smoke billowed everywhere and the fire was raging. Fortunately, the North District Fire Brigade learned of the fire and drove to put it out. The fire was extinguished shortly after, but the kitchen was almost completely destroyed. It was fortunate that there was no major disaster.</p>
<p>Feng Xian Tea House: A fire broke out in the Feng Xian Tea House at No. 86 Chezhan Road in Nanshi at 11:25 AM yesterday morning. Because there were many tea guests at the time, the fire was discovered early. The South District Fire Brigade quickly arrived to put out the fire, but only one corner was burned, and the wooden pillars and sundries were scorched.</p>
<h3>Appeal Case of Five Hua Bank, Fan Shaoliang and Others Could Not Be Served</h3>
<p>After the Guangzhou Five Hua Industrial Trust Bank Shanghai Branch at 130 Ningbo Road and the Five Hua Bank Branch at 162-166 Mai Gao Bao Lu Road in the French Concession went bankrupt on August 1 last year, ten creditors with deposits, savings, and current accounts, including Zhu Longgen, Shi Pengfei, Shen Peng, Chen Xianji, Du Zhiji, Luo Hua, Shi Bilong, Zhou Delin, Wang Fulin, and Pan Yuanji, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Fan Shaoliang, Ye Haitian, and Wang Jian'e, the deputy managers of the two branches of the Hua Bank, and Nangli Xie Shunzhi, Tang Songshan, and consultants Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian, of jointly defrauding and breaching trust, and violating the Banking Law. They requested that they be interrogated according to the law. After repeated hearings and investigations, on April 15 of this year, Fan Shaoliang and Ye Haichuan were sentenced for operating a savings bank business without the approval of the Ministry of Finance and were fined 1,000 yuan each. If they were to serve imprisonment instead of paying the fine, it would be converted at the rate of three yuan per day. The other defendants were found not guilty. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. The plaintiffs expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court, requesting that the original verdict be revoked and that the defendants be punished for their crimes. The High Court issued summonses a few days ago and originally scheduled to hold a collegial court hearing yesterday afternoon. However, because the defendants Fan Shaoliang, Ye Haitian, Wang Jian'e, Wu Yousan, Xie Shunzhi, and Tang Songshan could not be served, only Tang Shoumin and Chen Bingqian appointed lawyers to represent them. Therefore, Judge Wang Yue changed the date to an investigative hearing. Only Zhu Longgen, one of the appellants and plaintiffs, and his lawyer appeared in court. After a brief hearing, the court ordered that the defendants be summoned to appear in court for trial at a later date.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs: Disaster Relief Funds to Continue Distribution Tomorrow; Policyholders Willing to Donate Remaining Funds to Aid Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, after the January 28th Shanghai War, the Zhabei Disaster Area Insurance Association, on behalf of insured policyholders in the war-torn area, claimed fire insurance premiums from the Shanghai United Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. Except for the first batch of compensation of 20,000 yuan, which was allocated last winter under the auspices of the Bureau of Social Affairs and distributed to various disaster-stricken households, the second batch of 20,000 yuan will also be distributed to each household at the Zhabei Charity Organization on Datong Road on the 13th and 14th of this month. Each disaster-stricken household will receive a relief fund (i.e., fire insurance premium compensation) of six yuan. There are still over a thousand disaster-stricken policyholders. (Calculating based on the second batch of relief funds of 20,000 yuan, there is still a surplus of over 10,000 yuan.) They have received notification letters from the Bureau of Social Affairs, along with a receipt, instructing each policyholder to sign and stamp, fill in the address noted during communication, and come to the organization to collect the funds at the appointed time. Public announcement is hereby made.</p>
<p>Policyholders Xu Jia San and others, considering that after the second batch of relief funds of 20,000 yuan is distributed to the disaster-stricken policyholders (six yuan per household), there will still be a considerable surplus, intend to reallocate the surplus funds to charitable organizations to be used as funding for charitable causes and to aid the poor. They specifically sent a letter to the chairman of the Disaster Area Insurance Association yesterday to request approval. The original letter stated, "Respectfully submitted, I have been employed at Xiangmao Foreign Firm for many years. My original residence was at No. 02 and No. 404 on Baoshan Road, Zhabei. On August 27th of the Republic of China year, I purchased 1,000 taels of fire insurance, covering my property, from Shanghai United Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, holding policy No. 52002. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of the January 28th War, my residence was unfortunately burned down on March 4th of that year. I repeatedly negotiated with the company for compensation without success. Fortunately, you generously provided relief by organizing the Zhabei Disaster Area Insurance Association to claim compensation on behalf of the distressed policyholders. After years, a relief fund of 40,000 yuan was finally allocated and, designated by the Bureau of Social Affairs, transferred to your association for distribution in two batches, six yuan per household, to show sympathy. I am deeply grateful. However, I already collected this relief fund during the first distribution. Seeing the crowds of disaster victims, I felt deeply saddened and unwilling to dispute its receipt. Considering that the harsh winter is approaching in an instant, the homeless and hungry are everywhere, crying out for food. Providing relief to those who are truly poor is something that cannot be delayed. Therefore, after much contemplation, I voluntarily donate the six yuan of fire insurance relief fund I am entitled to, to be used for Zhabei's charitable endeavors. This small amount is a drop in the bucket and insufficient to solve the problem, but it is merely intended as a first step. At the same time, I hope that other sympathetic individuals can embrace this intention. I appeal to your association to consider the suffering of the disaster victims in Zhabei with all remaining undistributed funds, and jointly donate to be uniformly used as funding for the more successful charitable organizations in Zhabei, so that the refugees can receive tangible benefits, not just for the good fortune of Zhabei... (omitted below)."</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Wuxi Bus: Installing Coal-Powered Fuel System, Saving Over Four Yuan Per 100 Kilometers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Wuxi long-distance bus company has recently installed coal-powered fuel systems produced by Zhongming Factory, with excellent results. Car No. 10, which was recently equipped, even reached Changshu on a trial run on December 8th, reaching a top speed of 45 miles, breaking all previous records. In terms of consumption, it consumes approximately 76 jin of wood per 100 kilometers, costing 1.75 silver dollars. If gasoline is used, it requires six gallons, which, at the market price of one dollar per gallon, would cost six silver dollars. Therefore, it can save 4.25 silver dollars per 100 kilometers. It is reported that Zhongming Factory is also striving for aesthetics in the installation, ensuring that it does not take up too much space. This is truly good news in the call to promote domestic goods.</p>

<h3>Beiping Universities Unite and Stand Together: Guanghua Association Sends Letters to Various Parties Indicating That China Can Defend Itself; Peking University, Normal University, Tsinghua University, and Other Schools Organize Student Union</h3>
<p>—Jiang Menglin and Others Visited He Yingqin and Song Zheyuan—</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) The presidents of Beiping universities, including Jiang Menglin, Xu Songming, Mei Yiqi, Li Zheng, and Lu Zhizhang, have visited He Yingqin and Song Zheyuan, the leading figures in the current situation, multiple times. They have not only made requests regarding the safety of the schools but also expressed their views on the situation in North China. They have particularly emphasized their support for the central government. The Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Tianjin Universities and Colleges has telegraphed the central government and issued a declaration. The North China Cultural Association has also expressed its views on the current situation. On the 8th, they sent letters to various parties indicating that China is not incapable of defending itself. The Beiping Student Union is also being organized by representatives from various universities and will be established soon. A summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Cultural Association (omitted above): Now, they are imitating the story of the East India Company, except that the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Zhongxing Company are establishing a Sino-Japanese "Manchuria" economic group. Recently, eastern Hebei declared independence, using the guise of "anti-communism and autonomy." The Yellow River and Yangtze River are being crossed. The best course of action now is to immediately stop the civil war and mobilize the national masses, which is the only way out for China's freedom. Therefore, to unleash the power of national self-defense, it is necessary to realize absolute freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication. Furthermore, externally, it is necessary to unite with oppressed nations and those who treat us equally to obtain fair international assistance. We feel deeply the deepening national crisis and feel that every individual has a responsibility. We respectfully submit our sincere thoughts and hope that the people of the country will rise up and take action. The North China Cultural Association.</p>
<p>Organizing the Student Union: The Beiping Student Union has a long history. The earliest student union dates back twenty years. Since the Zhang Xueliang era, there have been three sessions of the Beiping Student Union, but it ended due to environmental factors. Now, Beiping University, Peking University, Normal University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and other schools have each organized their own student unions, and the process is going smoothly. Representatives from all classes of the School of Law and Commerce of Beiping University have held joint meetings and decided to first contact the Women's College of Arts and Sciences, Agriculture, Engineering, and Medicine, and then contact Tsinghua, Peking University, and other schools to organize the Beiping Student Union. It is said that representatives from the student unions of various universities had a meeting today (the 8th).</p>

<h3>The Problem of Improving Chinese Musical Instruments (II)</h3>
<p>— Ding Xielin</p>
<p>Secondly, those who have studied Western painting are mostly more able to appreciate Chinese painting, and those who have studied Western drama are mostly more able to appreciate Chinese drama. Assuming that music is an exception, those who have studied Western music cannot appreciate the monotonous Chinese music. However, can the monotony of Chinese music be blamed on Chinese instruments, especially the existing Chinese instruments that have not been improved with modern scientific knowledge? Moreover, only a very small number of intellectuals have received Western music education. What the general public can appreciate and play is Chinese music, and what they can buy and play with is Chinese musical instruments. Shop assistants who have finished a day's business, workers and farmers who have finished a day's hard work, and pedestrians who are tired, blow a xiao or play a erhu under the shade of a tree. This is a very common phenomenon, and it is a phenomenon worthy of admiration and encouragement. In a situation where we cannot persuade them to abandon the bamboo pipes or noisy bamboo buckets in their hands and replace them with an Italian violin, we can only improve the existing instruments in their hands and hope that the instruments will be played more widely after being improved. Furthermore, some people feel that the volume of most Chinese musical instruments is too small. It is okay for one person to play and listen alone, or for one person to play and a few people to listen, but it is completely useless in a large concert hall or when accompanying other instruments. The lack of loud instruments in China is indeed a big shortcoming. The volume of some Chinese musical instruments may not be increased or should not be increased, but the low volume itself is not necessarily a shortcoming. There are two aspects to volume: one is related to the music itself. Some pieces of music should use strong sounds, and some pieces of music should use soft sounds. Instruments with low volume are of course a style that should exist. The other aspect is related to the problem of sound transmission. It seems hopeless for thousands of people to listen to a guqin solo in a large concert hall. However, is it really hopeless? After the extreme progress of architectural acoustics, who can determine that even a Chinese guqin solo can change from a "barely audible sound in front of dozens of people" to a "barely audible sound in front of thousands of people"? Moreover, after the development of broadcasting technology, just for the sake of appreciating music, there may be no need to squeeze into a crowd of thousands of people at all.</p>
<p>What has been said above seems to be defending Chinese musical instruments everywhere, but it is absolutely not. What we are saying is only the abstract "Chinese musical instruments," not the various specific Chinese musical instruments that exist now. The instruments made and used by ordinary people now can be said to have many shortcomings in terms of structural principles. Taking the most common xiao and flute as an example, it can even be said that they are not musical instruments, because they lack the basic conditions of musical instruments, that is, they cannot produce tones that conform to the musical scale. We cannot agree with the views of the class of people who extremely worship Chinese inherent culture, and that is why. Now let us talk about this second view again. Regarding China's inherent musical culture, there are two aspects related to this article: the first is the musical scale. China has always linked the musical scale with the calendar and weights and measures, so dynasties have regarded it as a political system, and scholars have regarded it as a profound and specialized field of learning. There are probably more writings on the study and discussion of musical scales than writings on other aspects of music. However, it seems strange to say that in China's inherent musical culture, in addition to historical value, the most useless thing in seeking the progress of Chinese music in the future is the national heritage that belongs to the aspect of musical scales. This principle is easy to understand, that is because the musical scale has purely become science. Regarding this point, we may as well say a little more, because there are still many scholars who hope to find valuable things from piles of waste paper. We can divide the evolution of knowledge about musical scales into three stages. At first, we relied entirely on human hearing to recognize harmonious musical scales. There are two ways to obtain harmonious musical scales from musical instruments or any sound-emitting objects: one is to use pipes, and the other is to use strings. Greece discovered the method of seeking musical scales with strings in a very early era, and China discovered the method of seeking musical scales with pipes in an even earlier era, and these two methods are completely the same. They can all be named with the old Chinese name "the method of increasing and decreasing by thirds." The so-called method of increasing and decreasing by thirds is to increase the length of a pipe by one-third of its original length or decrease the length of a pipe by one-third of its original length. The new sound produced can be harmonious with the original sound. If we start with a pipe that is one foot long and continue to increase and decrease according to this method, we can obtain several pipes of different lengths that produce several sounds of different pitches. These sounds or musical scales are what are called "Huang Zhong," "Da Lu," etc. in Chinese books. This is the first stage. Decreasing by one-third results in a ratio of two to three, and increasing by one-third results in a ratio of three to four. Why can string lengths or pipe lengths that form simple ratios produce harmonious musical scales? This is the question raised by the great Greek philosopher Pythagoras.</p>
<h3>News from Various Schools</h3>
<p>Fudan High School: The military training results of Fudan High School in Xujiahui are remarkable. Since winning the runner-up in the Shanghai Municipal High School General Review, the training has been even more diligent. In addition to holding a general assembly every Monday afternoon, there are also organizations such as field combat teams, bugle teams, and military chemical teams. Students' daily meals and accommodation are militarized, and discipline is excellent. The school suddenly held a midnight assembly at 3:00 last night. As soon as the police siren blew, all 300 students of the school army gathered on the playground within five minutes. The speed of the assembly and the neatness of the uniforms are definitely not achieved overnight. The school's street fighting exercise is even more skilled. It is divided into three squads, each with 100 people. Yesterday, one squad was assigned to defend and two squads were assigned to attack, under the command of Director Yin Yizhi, Instructor Wang Shanyuan, and Dean of Discipline Leng Xueqiao, respectively.

<h3>Tiesheng Cup Basketball Tournament Today: Chizhi vs. Tongji</h3>
<p>Each team should pay attention to the changes in game time. Hanliang has withdrawn from the game against Jiangwan yesterday.</p>
<p>The Tiesheng Cup Basketball Tournament was lively yesterday because of the Group A game between Hanliang and Jiangwan. However, Hanliang withdrew temporarily due to some reason, so the game did not take place, which was quite disappointing. Only three Group B games were played yesterday. Xiangyin easily defeated Youmo. The strength of Fuyi and Tielun was equal, and the competition was fierce. In the last game, Haijing faced Minli. Haijing was a basketball team from Pudong Middle School with average talents. Minli was not its opponent. In the first half, Haijing led by 22 to 10. Minli still made no progress in the second half. As a result, Haijing won by 45 to 20. Today, the Group A game between Tongji and Chizhi will be played. The strength is equal, and the competition will be fierce. The results of yesterday's game and today's schedule are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Western Youth Basketball Thriller: Pirates Luckily Beat Mailing</h3>
<p>33 to 28 The last five minutes decided the outcome</p>
<p>Pirates and Mailing are both strong Western basketball teams. The players are tall and their offensive and defensive strategies are similar. They met in the Western Youth Basketball Group A game yesterday, refereed by Zhang Guozhen. Mailing was always in the lead, but unfortunately, Pirates scored six consecutive points in the last three minutes and lost by 28 to 33.</p>
<p>More than 500 spectators came to watch the game between the two teams. The performance was truly divine and extremely tense. Mailing's passing and shooting have improved compared to the War Association and Shijin, so the Western Youth is strong, and it can only catch up with Mire at this time. The difference was always one or two points in the first half. As a result, Mailing led by 14 to 13. In the subsequent men's basketball game, Haihao and Liangzao tied. However, after 19 to 20, Mailing's offense became more intense, resulting in 27 to 22, more than five points ahead. Pirates followed closely and after 27 to 28, Piser and Lanjuan scored four consecutive goals, winning by five points, which can be said to be lucky.</p>

<p>Jinan Defeats Qingguang: Qingguang has many veterans. Although their basketball skills have declined, their spirit is still good. Newcomers Tao Shaosheng and Han Renxiang are both promising. The five players from Jinan are young and strong, but their shooting is still lacking. If they can pay more attention in the future, it will not be difficult for them to compete with Pirates and Xie Xing. The competition was still fierce in the first half of yesterday's game. In the second half, Qingguang players' physical strength was not enough, so they frequently substituted players. As a result, Jinan won by 53 to 34.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (121)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>When Mrs. Shu heard that this team of people was lost, a serious expression appeared on her face, so she sent Fu Lang to ride Tu Pi to find the little people back. When dinner was over, the whole family sat in the cool courtyard as usual, Fu Lang had already ridden Tu Pi back at a gallop, covered in dust, with a panicked expression on his face.</p>
<p>He shouted as soon as he was halfway through the gate passage, "Are they back?"</p>
<p>"No"! Saying this, Mrs. Shu jumped out of her chair. Her expression was so flustered that everyone jumped up and surrounded Fu Lang to listen to the news.</p>
<p>"I can't find them anywhere," he began to say; but before he could finish, a loud "Hello" made them all look up. In an instant, they were next to the house.</p>
<p>"Where are Nan En and Luo Bo?" Mrs. Shu shouted, grabbing Ai Mi with one hand. His strength made him think that his aunt had suddenly gone crazy.</p>
<p>"I don't know, they've gone home with other people. Aren't they back yet?" he quickly replied.</p>
<p>"No, Tai Fei and Tao Mo said they went with you."</p>
<p>"They didn't, and we didn't see them. We swam in the Ye Pond and then came back from the woods," said Jie Ke, who was very panicked.</p>
<p>"Call Mr. Pei, light the lights, and tell Manager Lai that I want him."</p>

<h3>Finance Silver Market Showing Signs of Collapse, Standard Gold Price Continues to Rise by 8 Yuan 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>Margin Increased Suddenly to Over 12,000 Pieces; Closing Price 50 Yuan, Buyers Still Outnumber Sellers by 26</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday continued to report sharp declines in foreign silver prices. Trading was even suspended in London. Prices stabilized upon opening, but due to large holders selling at high prices, they remained fluctuating. Reuters reported favorable news, and the silver market showed signs of collapse, with buying interest increasing. Predictions of significant drops in Indian silver sparked rumors, and large short sellers rushed to cover, pushing prices beyond the 50 yuan mark. Early in the morning, reports from overseas silver markets indicated the suspension of trading in London, with even sharper declines in silver prices in the U.S. and Montevideo. However, exchange rates remained stable, and London gold fell by half a penny, maintaining confidence. Off-market pre-trading opened higher at 45-46 yuan, but Fuyu Yong and others sought to sell at high prices, causing a drop to 43-44 yuan. Fuxing Yong and others then entered the market at low prices, pushing it back up to around 45 yuan. At this point, demand and supply were chaotic, but transactions were extremely rare, creating a tense atmosphere. The Central Bank's listed prices for both British and American currencies remained unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained stable. The listed standard gold price fell to 1146 yuan 6 jiao. Tongfu, Zhentai, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yong and others sold off, retreating to within 44 yuan. However, Fuxing Yong, Qian Yuan Yong, and others continued to enter. The morning opened high, but due to strong selling pressure, it briefly declined. However, large holders bought in, and prices were quickly pulled up. HSBC's listed prices for both British and American currencies remained unchanged, with multiple deals in the middle, tightening the exchange market and increasing buying interest. Prices gradually improved, but repeated setbacks occurred after highs due to banks selling. The silver equalization tax announcement showed no change, and the market situation turned into a spin. Reuters telegraphed that U.S. Senator Thomas, a member of the U.S. banking faction, stated that the United States had been deceived for too long and should now wake up, stop buying silver, and watch the silver market collapse. With this news spreading, the sentiment among large holders improved, and sellers gradually decreased. When the Indian silver forecast a sharp drop of sixteen annas, retail investors were stimulated and became firm. Large holders bought strips, and occasionally, large short sellers like Yifeng Yong covered, causing the price to rise to 53 yuan 5 jiao. The situation remained stable at noon, and the number of margin calls for the January period increased to over 12,500, with bulls still exceeding bears by a significant margin of 26. This is a record of the day's market conditions.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1144 yuan 5 jiao, up 1 yuan from the previous close. Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Wanfeng immediately sold at 2 yuan 8 jiao. Fuxing Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Dingtai Qingfa Yong, Hengyu Hengchang Yong, Qian Yuan Yong, and others filed margins, rising to 4 yuan 7 jiao. Fuxing Yong, Richang Yifeng Yong sold, falling to 4 yuan 1 jiao. February U.S. dollars at 1875 were difficult to settle. Hengyu Ding Kang Yuan Mao Yong filed margins, rising to 5 yuan 4 jiao. Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Dafa Yong Hengyu sold strips, falling to 4 yuan 7 jiao. HSBC listed prices, British and American currencies were flat, and sentiment remained stable, with more fluctuations. Later, Tongfu Qianchang Xiang Chun Yuan Yong Hui Xiang Yuan Mao Yong Fuxing Yong came in and out, rising to 6 yuan 6 jiao. Hengchang Yong Shenfeng sold, retreating to within 6 yuan. Yongli Futai Heng Yuan Heng still filed and fluctuated more. Hengyu Dadecheng Dafa Yong sold off, falling to 5 yuan 3 jiao. Fuyu Tong Taichang Qian Yuan Yong Ding Kang still maintained, rising to 6 yuan. Tong Taichang Fuxing Yong Dadecheng sold off, falling to 4 yuan 8 jiao. The silver equalization tax announcement showed no change, and the market stabilized. Reuters telegraphed that U.S. Senator Thomas of the U.S. banking faction commented on silver, saying that Britain wanted to dominate the world, and China also intended to join the sterling bloc, leading to the current state of the silver market. Sir Rose was sent to China by the British and promoted China's monetary management to join the gold-sterling group, selling raw silver, buying gold. The United States has been deceived by this action for a long time and must now be awakened. The U.S. should no longer buy silver, because the U.S. should not help Britain to remedy China. This move benefits Britain, while the United States suffers. The collapse of the current silver market is also conducive to world currency. Hengyu Dadecheng Huixiang entered at 6 yuan 1 jiao, but retreated to 4 yuan 6 jiao due to the closing of Fuxing Yong and floating households. Reuters also telegraphed that yesterday's London market was extremely chaotic due to the late arrival of U.S. orders. Initial opening was about two pennies lower than the previous close, with the possibility of two quotations. Huixiang Yuqing Yong Hengyu Chun Yuan Yong Lifeng Fuxing Yong Qian Changxiang and others bought strips, rising to over 6 yuan. At this time, Yicheng Tongsai Chang sold, but the market's sentiment was stable. Dadecheng Yingfeng Heng Hengyu Yifeng Yong Lichang Huixiang Chun Yuan Yong all entered. Indian silver forecast fell sixteen annas, Fuxing Yong came in and out, gradually rising back to 8 yuan 7 jiao. Yongli and others sold late at high prices, falling to 7 yuan 8 jiao. Unexpectedly, rumors of issuing customs gold notes suddenly arose. Dadecheng Hengyu Huixiang Fuxing Yong Shunli Richang Yifeng Yong Fusheng Yong and others bought, rising to 53 yuan 5 jiao. Fuxing Yong Qian Yuan Yong sold strips at high prices, retreating to 1 yuan 5 jiao. Fuyu Hengyu still paid, with the afternoon close at 1151 yuan 8 jiao. After the close, Shunli Xiangfeng Ding Kang and others paid margins, once rising to 3 yuan. Dadecheng Qingfa Yong sold, with the final price around 52 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was raised by about 5 yuan based on the Central Bank's standard gold price listing of 1146 yuan 6 jiao, about 8 yuan lower than the previous close. The registered price for this month is 1143 yuan, and for January it is 1152 yuan. The morning water replenishment price is 1143 yuan. The price of pure gold is still the same as the standard gold price, at 1144 yuan 5 jiao. The spot market is stable, with pure gold adding 6 yuan, bought by Yingfeng Heng Tongfeng Hengmao totaling over 200 taels. Tianjin goods added 6 yuan, bought by Taikang Run at 350 taels. Swaps were very quiet.</p>
<p>Trading in the market gradually became active. In summary, Yifeng Yong Chun Yuan Yong Yuan Mao Yong Run Chang Yu Xiangfeng Yuan Sheng Yong Xiang He Lichang Feng Chang Shunmao Qian Yuan Yong Wanxing Shunli and others were buyers. Shenfeng Dadecheng Yicheng Hengyu Tongfeng Heng Richang Yongli Qingfa Yong Yingfeng Heng Wanfeng Hengyu and others were sellers. Qian Yuan Yong Qingfa Yong Fuxing Yong advanced and then exited. Hengyu Richang Dadecheng exited and then entered. The Dalian gang Shunli entered over 200 strips and exited a few. Wanxing entered over 100 strips and exited a few. The Guangdong gang Shengda Hengxing remained calm.</p>
<p>Checking the market situation, it was initially stable and then became brisk. The news was favorable, and large holders covered their shorts, leading to this result. The morning opening was 1144 yuan 5 jiao, and the afternoon close was 1151 yuan 8 jiao. The highest price was 1153 yuan 5 jiao, and the lowest price was 1142 yuan 8 jiao, with a total fluctuation of 10 yuan 7 jiao. As a result, it continued to rise by 8 yuan 3 jiao compared to the previous close. The total number of transactions in the half day was 14,728.</p>
<p>The January formation included more bulls: Shenfeng over 2700, Chun Yuan Yong over 1100, Yuan Mao Yong over 900, Tongzhai Chang over 500, Han Heng Huixian Tongfu over 400 each, Ding Kang Hengchang Yong Yuxin Xiangju Da over 300 each, Shunli Dachang Xiang Yuan Da Yong Fengchang Wanfeng over 200 each, Yan Yu Bingxing Yisheng Yong Heng Yuan Yi Huiyuan Hong Kang Yong Mao Jia Run Richang Dacheng Qian Yuan Yong Tiancheng Xiang over 100 each.

<h3>Japanese and Chinese Merchants Vigorously Buy, Exchange Market Clearly and Obscurely Tightens</h3>

Reuters telegraphed that U.S. Senator Thomas of the U.S. banking faction stated that the United States should now be aware that it had been deceived by China and Britain and should stop buying silver, as well as that the London silver market had already fallen by 2.25 pennies when it first opened yesterday, and that although the United States had entered the market afterwards, it was very small, so it was impossible to determine listed prices today. Sentiment gradually stabilized, and the process gradually softened. Later, Indian silver predicted a drop of sixteen annas, and banks came back to buy, and rumors were rampant again. The trend tightened again at noon. The noon close selling price for recent British exchange was one shilling, two and three-eighths of a penny, and American exchange was 29 yuan 5625. Compared to the previous close, British tightened by .15625, and American tightened by .25. Forwards tightened by .15625 for British and .1875 for American.

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Speculation Concentrated on Yarn Flowers, Rising Trend Resumes</h3>
<p>The yarn market has seen rapid ups and downs, with an upward trend appearing again. Recently, the fluctuations in margin deposits and public bonds have been relatively small, and most speculators have flocked to the yarn flower market. With this new batch of funds, market prices have become increasingly unstable, and the range of fluctuations has further expanded, with sudden rises and falls making it difficult to predict. However, industry peers such as Mr. Wu, Mr. Xu, and Mr. Bian are unanimously inclined to sell, while the amount of money dragged in by the financial sector is never released. Nevertheless, the cotton yarn inventory has increased again.</p>
<p>Forward Yarn Rises by 1.56 Yuan</p>
<p>In the pre-market trading of margin yarns, the near months remained sluggish with a lack of buyers, and prices continued to fall in all months. Unexpectedly, towards the close, due to Yuan Yi's purchases, the price suddenly jumped by more than one yuan. As a result, the near months fell by 9 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, while the far months rose by 3 jiao. In the afternoon opening, Yuan Yi, Shen Ji, and Da Fu made large purchases, and the rising momentum was sharp. However, Heng De, Tai Chang, and Yi Chang sold as much as possible, and the market price still did not rise. The closing price fell slightly. Osaka Sanpin, yarn fell two or three yuan. As a result, each month rose by 1.1, 2, 4, and 6 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. According to the investigation, Dafeng sold 1,150 bales, Daji 1,650 bales, Mingde 1,150 bales, Changji 1,100 bales, Dachangcheng 1,950 bales, Yuda 950 bales, Yuanda 600 bales, Shenchang 950 bales, Hengde 2,450 bales, Taichang 1,550 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, and Shengyuan 650 bales. Dafu bought 2,350 bales, Jinchang 900 bales, Zhenda 800 bales, Shenji 2,850 bales, Yuan Yi 1,050 bales, and Yongda 1,550 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Hankou 25, Ningbo 10, Caihu 10, Tianjin 25</p>
<p>Jiangxi 50, Nanjing 2</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned firm, and the rising trend has resumed. As expected by most people the previous day, American cotton was still expected to fall, and the telegrams showed mixed rises and falls, and people's minds were stable. However, the decline in Indian cotton was severe, and the opening price still trended downward. Later, after multiple pull-ups, the market price turned sharply upward.</p>
<h3>Zheng Qi Good for 5.5 Jiao</h3>
<p>In the pre-market opening of Sakura, each month remained sluggish. American cotton showed mixed rises and falls, and Indian cotton fell sharply by 5.5 rupees. The decline in the second and third tiers was severe. Unexpectedly, towards the close, the buying trend rose sharply, and people's minds were tense. Each month jumped by 3 jiao. As a result, each month rose by 1.2 jiao compared to the previous day's price. In the afternoon opening, the rising momentum was fierce, saying that the exchange rate was tightening. Run Kang, Yong Da, Yi Kang, and Yuan Yu Chang unanimously went long, and the market price rose. However, Yu Da and Yi Chang heavily shorted. Osaka Sanpin cotton fell by 6 jiao. As a result, each month rose by 3 jiao to 5.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price.

<h3>Long-Term American Cotton Long Positions Closed Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton was due to the continued closing of long positions from the previous day, poor news from Liverpool, and the uncertainty of the Supreme Court's ruling. Each month fell by 1 to 4 pounds per point. Later, the number of sellers decreased slightly, and the hedging sales were peaceful. Industry peers bought in, and the price rebounded. The actual situation has improved somewhat. However, industry peers are somewhat timid due to the low silver price and stock market. Finally, long-term positions were closed out again, and the shape was not good. As a result, spot prices rose by 5 pounds per point, and futures rose by 3 pounds per point to fall by 8 pounds per point. British cotton spot prices fell by 12 points, and futures fell by 10 points. Indian cotton first rose due to purchases by European exporters, and then weakened due to sales by futures traders and the closing of long positions. It is estimated that Pingguo'er fell by 4.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 5.25 to 5.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 5.625 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (10th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grain: Flour and Wheat Buying Anxious After the Market</h3>
<p>The flour market opened in the morning, and the months were generally calm. Due to the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago was good for about 3 jiao, and Canada was good for 4 fen. The market sentiment was due to the devaluation and purchase of silver in the United States, and both buyers and sellers could not help but have concerns, so the transaction was light, and the rise and fall were very small, and there was no difference from the previous day's closing price. Until the afternoon opening, due to the unpredictable silver policy in the United States, and the surrounding atmosphere was also very stable, the buying atmosphere was slightly active, and the near and far terms were high by 1 or 2 fen. The entry and exit of each factory was very small, and it was still a wait-and-see attitude. The key to the rise and fall in the future should be determined by whether foreign wheat can be determined.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened in the morning, and the months were unusually stable, and the transaction was also extremely cold. Due to the quotation of foreign wheat rebounding by 2 or 3 jiao, but the multi-head cannot be determined by the silver policy in the United States, the buying and selling are silent, and the price is only 2 or 3 fen. Until the afternoon opening, the transaction was still not smooth, and then the flour market rebounded, and the buying atmosphere was also more active, which was better than the morning closing price by 3 or 5 points. Looking at the current situation, the whole is transferred to the foreign situation, and the domestic supply and demand are not related to the wind. Now the wheat market is flat due to the factory's stomach, and each file is shouted at a small 1 fen, starting from Shandong Luohe Wheat 4 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen, Shaoxing Wheat 4 yuan 5 jiao 9 fen, Jiangbei Wheat 4 yuan 7 jiao 9 fen, Huaian Wheat 4 yuan 7 jiao 9 fen, Yangzhou Wheat 4 yuan 7 jiao 6 fen, Linhuai Guan Wheat 4 yuan 8 jiao, and 5,000 bags were removed by Fuxin.</p>

<h3>Thin Rice Floods in Continuing Small Corner Permission</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang still had fifty or sixty numbers, (a total of 12,300 stones of goods), and the thin rice was more common, so the international bag stomach became rarer. Tianjin Qingdao and other gangs handled more than 2,000 bags, and the opening price team fell from a small number of points to a corner. Although the digestion of thick early and other japonica rice was not smooth, it was due to the snowy weather and the people's hearts were stable. Du Yangjian had no honor or disgrace, and the negative change was fatigued.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 578 boats arrived from the river gangs. The retail sales of white japonica rice in the market were still flat. The hoarders continued to move skillfully, and the price was a small number of points again. Early rice followed small corners, and thin rice had limited stomach. The price was small corners, and the sheep tip port tip shop stomach was slightly taken. The market price was stable, and the white yuan was fixed. The price of other goods also weakened.</p>
<h3>Gan Rice Production Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of guest indica rice was endless, and the arrival of goods from Changjiang Road was endless. Jiangxi's harvest increased this year, and the number of exports was even greater. Because the recovered areas have reported a bumper harvest, the output has increased sharply, so recently they have arrived in port one by one. Wen and Taiwan in Zhejiang also arrived one by one, but the passenger hoarders stopped, and the market situation has been soft and tired for a long time. Yesterday, the stomach of this street was still active, and the market could still support the station. The whole day opened 4,000 bags of Gongxi rice, 525 bags of Wen, Tai, and Yong rice, and 200 bags of Hankou rice, all of which were handled by this street. Siamese rice was also opened 200 bags, and the market was similar to the previous market.</p>

<h3>Needle Eyebrow Green Tea European Sales Continue to Be Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market was not lonely. The British firm Jardine Matheson was still interested in the needle shoulder green tea from Lailu Village. However, due to the small inventory, the supply was in short supply, and the transaction was slightly lighter than before. The market for local Zhenmei pearl tea also has an active trend. Yesterday, Chinese and foreign trading parties had many discussions and negotiations. The reason is that the foreign silver price has plummeted, and the tea price is more suitable.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Iron Wire European Sales Suddenly Prosper</h3>
<p>The new iron wire has been very quiet recently, but the Wenzhou business has suddenly prospered in the past two days. The market turnover has reached as many as fifty or sixty buckets. The market price has not risen or fallen much because the holders are eager to sell. No. 16 to No. 20 are estimated at 14 yuan per dan, and No. 21 to No. 25 are estimated at 17 yuan. It is heard that the business in this street and the buying and selling of other passenger gangs have not improved, and the market is still desolate.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Has a Bumper Harvest</h3>
<p>Asphalt production in the new Zhejiang Road is the earliest. It has been a month since the new goods arrived in Shanghai. The market has gradually trended downward. The local car oil in Zhejiang Jixing area has started to sell at 18 yuan per dan, and now it has fallen to 16.5 yuan. Because Zhejiang Province has had a bumper year this year, and the output has increased by four or five times compared to last year, the price will be cheaper when the output increases. When the local banks have not seen the new time, they all rely on Zhejiang oil for replenishment, so the goods transported from Zhejiang, Dongxi, Jinlan, and Jiahe have been quite a few in recent months. However, each distribution of sales fields, soap makers use orchid oil, and candle makers use Caiben. As for the Jing, Jin, Zhi, and Ma oils transported from Hankou, because the new goods arrived in Shanghai slightly later, they are not taken temporarily. The new oil arriving in Hankou in recent days, only Macheng Jing oil needs to wait until after the winter solstice. The price of the new Macheng oil head plate opened at 11.4 yuan per scale, and then fell to 14.2 yuan. It is heard that the foreign company has handled 4,500 pieces of expired goods, and the price is between 14.45 yuan, and the delivery period is at the end of the ancient calendar December. Soap factories in Hanzhi have also handled it. Chen Jingjin has a weight of 11 taels 78 cents per weight, and Chen Macheng has a weight of 11 taels 45 cents per dan. Foreign soap factories want to handle the goods, so the market has the possibility of standing still, and there is no hope of falling again.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Opens Vigorously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned active in sales, and the trend gradually tightened. The association's whiteboard 24 coarse sand white spot was traded at 22.05 yuan, an increase of 5 fen. The transshipment was called 6.8 yuan and did not succeed. The cotton white of this factory did not rise or fall. Zhenji No. 1 was still 20.7 yuan. The turnover of the sugar industry cooperative company's auction increased suddenly. It is estimated that 3,050 bags of Guangzhou coarse sand white were sold for 21.85 yuan, and the entire number was sold through, and the market was quite beautiful. However, the sales of No. 2 and No. 4 Guangdong cotton white were relatively stagnant, and the original price was not received. The opinions of both parties of the No. cargo, such as Quanzhou Chibai Sugar Line, are gradually approaching, and it is expected to be settled today. East Red MS Mark 16.6 yuan, NKC Mark 17 yuan, all have transactions. No. 8 White called for an increase of 1 jiao, which was 21.8 yuan and did not succeed. The transfer TK Mark 6.7 yuan, EJ Mark 6.65 yuan, slightly traded. No. 9 White called for an increase of 5 fen, which was 21.6 yuan and did not succeed. The transfer SH Mark 6.55 yuan, there were slight transactions, and the markets were tight.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: White Lotus Rolling Shortage Land Price Rises</h3>
<p>Recently, the white lotus has reported that the inventory in the production area is scarce, and the land price has risen. According to a letter from Lanxi, the current market has reached 534 yuan, and the Shencheng cost must be 578 yuan. It is found that the sales in Guangdong in Shenshi have also been active recently, and the price has also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the market sold for 56 yuan, which was more than 8 yuan more than the end of last month. The difference between Xianglian is gradually widening. The better Xianglian is only more than 40 yuan. The high and low prices are judged by the thickness of the inventory.</p>

<p>Special Issue on Lung Disease</p>
<p>P&gt;Practical Discussion on Organ Therapy for Lung Disease</p>
<p>— Physician Shen Xiangbo</p>
<p>There are indeed many internal medicines for treatment in modern times. Sweat cattle fill the beams. Fingers cannot be counted. However, in the practical experiment of clinical application, those who can achieve satisfactory results are rare. As for the medicines listed in the advertisements, although they are vigorously promoted for their efficacy, they are actually of no practical benefit. It is just a waste of harm. Sometimes it can stop coughs, but it is the power of the tranquilizers it contains, and it has no fundamental cure effect. Moreover, the ingredients in the internal medicines for lung disease have always been nothing more than calcium, phosphorus, fish liver oil, etc. This kind of medicine may only be effective for a while, or only suitable for the initial stage, or it will ruin the stomach if you take too much, or you cannot interrupt it if you take it for a long time. These are not fundamental medicines for treating diseases.</p>
<p>Recently, there is "Fei Huo" Phith Weal, which I consider to be the best internal medicine for tuberculosis. In the world, it can be called a unique effective medicine for treating lung. According to reports from European and American scholars and experiments by doctors in various countries, it is confirmed to be the safest and most effective internal treatment for lung disease. Only "Fei Huo" Phith Weal is used because the materials used are made from the hormones extracted from the fresh lungs and spleens of mammals. It has a direct effect on lung lesions. Fill in its defects. Harmonize and maintain its function. At the same time, a solid connective wall is built around the lesions to harden them. Promote the formation of scars. Completely wrap the evil demon's tuberculosis bacteria. Then let it self-destruct. Moreover, the effective components of this lung and spleen also have the power to promote blood coagulation. Therefore, "Fei Huo" Phith Weal's effect on preventing bleeding (hemoptysis) is particularly significant.</p>
<p>"Fei Huo" Phith Weal is mainly composed of lung and spleen organ components, and also contains lecithin (ie, lipids) and other nourishing and strengthening medicines. Therefore, after use, it can produce blood and fatty muscles, make physical strength vigorous, restore the gradually disappearing life functions, increase the natural resistance to diseases, and make patients leave the disease quickly and recover in a very short period of time. The ancients said, "A good doctor treats the disease." People who suffer from neurasthenia and physical weakness are most likely to develop tuberculosis. Taking "Fei Huo" Phith Weal can make the body healthy and strong, and increase the power to resist infection. Therefore, taking this medicine has the effect of "treating tuberculosis if you have tuberculosis", "increasing health and preventing tuberculosis if you don't have tuberculosis", which is suitable for both prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>Since I have been using "Fei Huo" Phith Weal in clinical practice, I have treated hundreds of cases of all stages of tuberculosis. All have unexpected results. Most of them are cured in one month for mild cases and no more than two or three months for severe cases. It is handy and the medicine cures the disease. It is indeed the champion of internal medicines for lung disease. The results of the application of this medicine are briefly described on the left.</p>
<p>(1) After using this medicine, the effective components are absorbed and surround the tuberculous lesions to build a solid connective wall to prevent the spread of microorganisms. Moreover, microorganisms gradually die due to lack of nutrition. Therefore, chills, coughs, hemoptysis, and all symptoms are rapidly reduced.</p>
<p>(2) After taking it for several weeks in a row, the complexion will be ruddy and the spirit will be full. No longer as lethargic as before.</p>
<p>(3) In addition to the lung preparations, "Fei Huo" Phith Weal also contains lecithin, liver gland hormones, testicular gland hormones, and other precious products that produce sperm and replenish blood. Therefore, patients only use one type of "Fei Huo", but the benefits obtained are better than using several types of medicines. Suitable for the economy.</p>
<p>(4) The taste is sweet and easy to take. Even women and children are happy to take it. Frequent use of it will stimulate appetite and make the body healthier day by day. "Fei Huo" Phith Weal is an organ preparation, which does not contain any harmful chemical substances. Therefore, even if you take it all year round, there will be no adverse effects.</p>
<p>The "Fei Huo" has such satisfactory results, which is by no means comparable to other common lung medicines. Here are a few words to tell the patients at home and abroad.</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>1. The Danger to Lung Disease Patients</p>
<p>The danger to lung disease patients often lies not in the disease itself, but in the treatment methods. Some patients, lacking medical knowledge, seek quick results, mistakenly trusting friends' advice or believing advertisements' exaggerated claims without careful consideration, purchasing and trying various medications. Little do they know that treating lung disease relies on the body's natural vigorous functions to allow connective tissue proliferation, surrounding the lesions for healing. If they believe that medications can kill tuberculosis bacteria, then indiscriminately using advertised drugs is not only useless for lung disease, but sometimes even harmful, posing a life-threatening risk, delaying treatment, and wasting money. Even more harmful is that some who use such medications may experience temporary relief, but this is because their bodies have a strong resistance to lung disease and would have healed naturally even without medication; it is not the medicine's effect.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Today's most reliable and well-founded treatment for lung disease is solely to assist the body's natural healing functions to flourish. There is no other reliable method. However, when the disease has plagued our bodies for a long time, these functions are often hindered, leading to their inability to develop. At this time, we often rely on this natural mechanism and provide assistance. What is this method? It is organ therapy. Therefore, in the modern tuberculosis treatment community, "Lung Vitality" (Phithweal), made from hormones extracted from the lungs and spleens of mammals, is uniformly used for tuberculosis patients. This supplements their functions, making them vigorous, promoting connective tissue proliferation, surrounding the lesions, and completely stopping the disease's activity, ultimately leading to a complete halt and cure. Therefore, "Lung Vitality" (Phith Weal) is the most rational and safest oral panacea for pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
<p>2. The Issue of Libido in Lung Disease</p>
<p>Patients with lung disease inevitably experience a stronger libido than ordinary people. This phenomenon is not a physiological one, but a symptom of poisoning caused by the stimulation of nerves by bacterial toxins. Therefore, when lung disease patients experience such impulses, they must be vigorously suppressed. During the active (progressive) phase of lung disease, complete abstinence is essential; sexual intercourse is absolutely forbidden. Those who abstain often suffer from nocturnal emissions, which can also hinder healing. Therefore, for those who experience nocturnal emissions, taking "Juvenilin Tablets" orally, two to three tablets before bed, can alleviate their worries.</p>
<p>3. Lung Disease Requires Protein</p>
<p>Protein is the main component of human body tissues and the source of physical strength. Tuberculosis patients consume a particularly large amount of protein, so it is essential to supplement it. In patients with fever, protein breakdown in the body is even more pronounced. Approximately 90-100 grams of protein are needed per day, that is, 1.5-2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. From this perspective, nutritional therapy for lung disease patients, particularly protein supplementation, is even more important.</p>
<p>It is difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of protein from ordinary foods because protein must be digested into "Amino Acids" before it can be absorbed by the human body. However, the gastrointestinal systems of lung disease patients are inevitably weak. Although food contains abundant nutrients – protein – it is difficult to digest, making absorption impossible. As a result, it is excreted with feces without benefit. Therefore, it is necessary to seek additional supplementation outside of food.</p>
<p>Now, there is a blood-tonifying, nourishing, and strengthening agent, "Conbour's San-Vita-Cell," which is the ultimate digestive product of protein – a preparation of "Amino Acids." In other words, it is the essence of artificially digested protein. After taking it, it is absorbed directly without digestion, nourishing the human body, immediately producing blood, forming muscle, and promoting metabolism, invigorating all vital functions – mental and physical strength – and increasing resistance to disease. Therefore, it is now uniformly used in sanatoriums in various countries and regarded as an essential medicine to aid in the cure of lung disease. Recently, I have also confirmed this in clinical experiments. That is, all the lung disease patients I have advised to take it have reported its effectiveness.</p>
<p>4. Lung Disease and Neurasthenia</p>
<p>The recuperation period for lung disease is extremely long. Patients inevitably experience various hopes that turn into illusions during this period. The mental impact is already significant, compounded by social discrimination, friends' estrangement, and cold family treatment. Being in a sad, resentful, and lonely environment, it is almost inevitable that tuberculosis patients develop neurasthenia.</p>
<p>The mind is the central government of a person, and the functions of all parts of the body are controlled by its commands to function healthily.</p>
<p>When there is tuberculosis in a corner of the lung, and one seeks treatment, the first necessity is a healthy mental state. If one suffers from neurasthenia, insomnia, loss of appetite, and various subsequent impairments will occur, not only making it difficult for the disease to heal quickly, but also inevitably worsening the condition.</p>
<p>Patients should change their outlook on life over time, embracing emptiness, cultivating their body and mind. If they pay attention to their health, take "Lung Vitality" (Phith Weal) and "Conbour's San-Vita-Cell" and other medications, a cure can be expected. There is no need to be pessimistic and cause oneself unnecessary suffering.</p>
<p>If there are symptoms such as headache, dizziness, insomnia, mental depression, or mental confusion, these are severe symptoms of neurasthenia. In addition to strictly adhering to health preservation, it is advisable to take "Memory Neurotic" or "Well Tonic." The editor has used this method to cure many people, so it is considered an essential aspect of symptomatic treatment for lung disease.</p>
<h3>Youth's Depression</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Yiqing</p>
<p>Depression mostly develops in people who masturbate or have excessive sexual activity. Also, many women with irregular menstruation or who suffer from neurasthenia develop this condition.</p>
<p>Symptoms of this disease, in terms of physical aspects, include persistent insomnia, heavy head and dizziness, chest tightness, palpitations, general fatigue, digestive disorders, decreased nutritional secretion function, and constipation. In terms of mental aspects, there is a persistent depressive state, with clear consciousness but persistent distress, memory loss, sluggish thinking, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, and often suicidal and dangerous behavior.</p>
<p>The treatment for this disease first requires the patient to be quiet. Taking "Memory Neurotic" is extremely effective. Other treatments include promoting water circulation and nutritional therapy. "Conbour's San-Vita-Cell" can be used to nourish and strengthen those who are physically weak, enabling faster recovery. Stimulation on the body and mind must be absolutely avoided. In women with irregular menstruation or neurasthenia, in addition to the above treatments, "Menorrin" must be taken to nourish the blood and regulate menstruation for a complete cure.</p>
<h3>Young People: A Terrible Leak – Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Yiqing</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is the involuntary discharge of semen during sleep. The frequency of nocturnal emission varies depending on the individual's constitution and lifestyle. Some experience it two or three times a week, while others experience it once every few weeks. Nocturnal emissions are generally divided into two types: pathological and physiological. If the interval is more than one week, and there is no fatigue the next day, it is physiological and not a disease.</p>
<p>Pathological nocturnal emission refers to frequent nocturnal emissions that cause fatigue, headache, tinnitus, palpitations, fatigue in the limbs, back pain, and mental depression. Pathological nocturnal emission is not only common at night, but also occurs during the day due to erections, or from friction and pressure from bedding and clothing, or even from seeing a member of the opposite sex. This type of nocturnal emission is arguably the most severe, leading to extreme physical fatigue and disinterest in anything.</p>
<p>While there are various causes of nocturnal emission, they are all ultimately due to masturbation and excessive sexual activity, leading to severe neurasthenia, resulting in the distressing condition of nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>The treatment for nocturnal emission: Because nocturnal emission is not a specific disease, it is caused by other factors. Therefore, treatment must first eliminate the cause. People who masturbate or engage in other bad habits can recover by simply repenting, making a clean break, and diligently maintaining their health. The main health practices are: do not look at obscene pictures, avoid overworking the mind and body, avoid stimulating foods, eat light foods, and live a regular life.</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experience, I always prescribe "Juvenilin Tablets" to patients with nocturnal emission, three tablets at bedtime every night. This can immediately stop the nocturnal emissions. In most cases, a course of ten days can achieve a complete cure. If there are symptoms of sexual neurasthenia – impotence – premature ejaculation – decreased libido – premature aging, etc., "Well Tonic," a combined preparation of gonadal hormones, must be taken at the same time to restore marital bliss.</p>
<p>No matter how severe the nocturnal emission – and sexual neurasthenia, with the above treatment methods, I can guarantee a rapid recovery.</p>
<p>Note: There are many types of nocturnal emission pills sold in the market recently, but very few are effective, and many have side effects. Patients often experience harm before seeing any benefits. According to my experience, the "Juvenilin Tablets" from the Meilindeng Lin Pharmacy Manager are the safest and most effective. Patients should pay attention when purchasing.</p>
<h3>Lecture on Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Physician Jiang Guanqun</p>
<p>Youth's Crisis!</p>
<p>Neurasthenia Caused by Masturbation</p>
<p>Neurasthenia, as it is commonly known, is often thought to be caused by overwork – excessive diligence – or unusual setbacks. However, self-desecration (i.e., masturbation) is actually one of the biggest causes of neurasthenia. From the lower class to the upper class youth, those who have never experienced this self-desecration are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, almost nonexistent! Self-desecration greatly increases physical weakness and reduces mental strength. Those with nervous constitutions often unconsciously commit self-desecration (masturbation) while suffering from insomnia. Young people are unaware of how self-desecration weakens the body. However, the more frequent the self-desecration, the more the body is affected – and the energy is greatly reduced – the impact on the mind is self-evident. Moreover, the result of self-desecration will lead to significant nervous tension, resulting in nervous sensitivity, fatigue, and a mind that is often excited, pessimistic, and depressed. Self-desecration weakens the heart and also reduces eyesight, perception, judgment, memory, and imagination. Therefore, the negative effects of self-desecration – masturbation – often include mental fatigue, haggard appearance, poor memory, difficult actions, and a multitude of diseases. In a dying state, lingering in bed, it is as if one is living the day of death. Even if life is preserved, and one lives on, the future is almost completely lost. Although there is ambition, the impact is so significant that it is deeply regrettable. Young men, restrain yourselves from this harmful behavior!</p>
<p>Sexual desire is generally caused by the brain's function. The way to suppress it is to strive to make the brain healthy, which is the fundamental solution. According to the editor's clinical experience, for all the young people who masturbate, I teach them to take "Memory Neurotic." Those who have taken it have had very satisfactory results – naturally and no longer masturbating. That is, all the symptoms of weakened brainpower caused by excessive masturbation, such as headache, insomnia, forgetfulness, tinnitus, and blurred vision, gradually disappear, leading to a healthy brain.</p>
<p>People who masturbate excessively, because they excrete too much semen, cause a decline in the function of the endocrine system, resulting in fatigue, general illness, mental depression, rapid breathing, palpitations, memory loss, muscle wasting, premature aging, and dysfunction of the reproductive organs, such as impotence, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation. The fundamental treatment for these various diseases caused by the decline in endocrine function is to use endocrine preparations to supplement the deficiency. There is no other good method. Although there are countless endocrine preparations sold on the market now – such as Sibaoming and others – those that are effective are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. There are still unscrupulous merchants who disregard morality. How many – say the truth – sell fake drugs of inferior quality, buyers should pay special attention!</p>
<p>According to the editor's clinical experiment, "Well Tonic" from the manager of Meilindeng Western Pharmacy has the most reliable effectiveness because it is a combined preparation of gonadal (hormones), made from the effective ingredients of animal testes, prostate, thyroid, adrenal glands, and pituitary glands. According to my experience, taking "Well Tonic" orally, three times a day, two tablets each time, is effective in just one bottle. For example, mental clarity, good sleep, increased appetite, increased body fat, rapid recovery from fatigue, and reproductive organ functions such as impotence, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation can be cured. Incomplete reproductive development is often restored. The weakened elderly have the effect of restoring fertility and sufficient vitality. Animal experiments have confirmed that it has the function of prolonging life. Everyone I have advised to take "Well Tonic" has recovered their health. This is my honest testimony!</p>
<p>If there are severe diseases such as nocturnal emission – wet dreams – semen leakage – etc., this is because the seminal gate is not firm. You can take "Juvenilin Tab.," which has superior efficacy and no side effects. It is not comparable to other drugs. According to clinical experiments, it usually heals after taking one bottle.</p>

<h3>What is National Self-Confidence?</h3>
<p>— Li Jianfang</p>
<p>"National Self-Confidence!" "National Self-Confidence!" The more people shout this slogan like crazy, the more this slogan loses its original meaning.</p>
<p>Some people say that national self-confidence is nothing more than belief in China's inherent morality; others say that promoting national self-confidence lies in knowing that we are a nation with thousands of years of history; still others say that promoting national self-confidence is about preserving the national essence and Chinese culture; and even more people say that promoting national self-confidence lies in our not forgetting our ancestors and worshiping them!</p>
<p>"National Self-Confidence," "National Self-Confidence," in the eyes of those who need this slogan to exercise their ability to deceive, it is simply the sculpture of the Greek Daedalus.</p>
<p>What exactly is national self-confidence?</p>
<p>To explain what national self-confidence is, one must first explain what personal self-confidence is. Is personal self-confidence like Ah Q, who, when someone grabs his queue and bumps his head against the wall four or five times, still mutters "Son beats father" in the spirit of "spiritual victory"? Of course not! Although personal self-confidence cannot lack a strong will and passion, a strong will and passion like Ah Q's definitely do not count as self-confidence. If one insists on saying that this is also a kind of self-confidence, then at most one can only say that it is a comical expression of self-confidence, and definitely cannot say that it is a solemn expression of self-confidence.</p>
<p>So, what is personal self-confidence? The most basic understanding of personal self-confidence should be a kind of confidence that an individual generates from reason and experience, from a deep understanding and grasp of their own abilities and the career they pursue. From this point of view, so-called national self-confidence is nothing more than a shared confidence that a nation generates from its own reason and experience, from a deep understanding and grasp of its own abilities and the great national goal it hopes for.</p>
<p>If this affirmation is correct, then not only promoting the restoration of old morality, promoting the preservation of national essence, promoting the preservation of Chinese culture, promoting idol worship, and promoting megalomania do not count as promoting national self-confidence, but also emptyly promoting the passion of loving the country and the nation without enlightening the people's intelligence and critical spirit also does not count as promoting national self-confidence. Why? Because the power of emotion cannot but be consistent with the rigor of logic. A passion that is not consistent with the rigor of logic, whether it comes from an individual or a nation, can at most explain a kind of respectable uselessness, a solemn childishness. The White Lotus Rebellion was not without a noble passion for loving the country and the race, but only because of their ignorance of their era, their movement, their sacrifices, not only did not benefit China, but instead deepened China's oppression and collapse.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that national spirit or national self-confidence is definitely not a simple expression of national sentiment. It is rather a comprehensive expression of the people's deep understanding of their era and a deep grasp of their own abilities. National sentiment is indeed an important element of national self-confidence, but if national sentiment is not built on the inevitability of success, then so-called national sentiment will surely easily become yesterday's news!</p>
<p>Even in our daily lives, there are many things that, although they can deeply grab our hearts and make them suffer when starting from the emotional side, completely become meaningless things when starting from the rational side. Can one say that the things that give the strongest momentary stimulation to sentiment at the same time must have a deep practical significance for the life of the nation and the country?</p>
<p>From this, it can be known that an excessive emphasis on inherent morality, ethics, national essence, and even emotion, not only cannot guide the people's feelings and attention to understanding and researching actual phenomena to generate self-confidence, but also will guide them to the opposite direction, guiding them to directly oppose deep understanding and research, thus generating various paths of fantasy. The promotion of national self-confidence, to this point, cannot but become the promotion of national suicide!</p>
<p>From this perspective, only when national passion and national knowledge reach unity and consistency can a third thing be generated – national self-confidence, this is indeed definite and unshakable!</p>
<p>Based on this, it can be known that the various movements of restoration, reaction, and worshiping spirits currently advocated in China's ideological circles are not only not promoting national self-confidence, but simply eliminating national self-confidence from the root.</p>
<p>Wherever scientific interest and critical spirit gradually decrease, the individual's reason loses its power even more. Whenever the individuals' reason in a nation loses its power, they seek help from fantasy and the salvation of heroes, and thus lose national self-confidence. China first fell to the northern barbarians, not during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States period when knowledge was spreading, but during the Wei and Jin dynasties after Confucianism and Buddhism ruled China. The transformation of social relations was the cause, and the ideological cage and the tendency of the people at that time to seek help from transcendental mystical thought due to the ideological cage also greatly contributed to it!</p>
<p>In fact, any great historical movement or social movement is not only the result of conforming to the actual interests of the people or classes of that time, but also the result of a critical spirit, reason, and intellectual movement. The era when religious fantasy became the banner of historical movements has passed. Now, all liberation movements, especially the Chinese national liberation movement, if it cannot thoroughly have an intellectual and critical spirit liberation movement first to stimulate the intelligence and passion of the entire nation, then it is completely hopeless.</p>
<p>Having said this, I seem to no longer need to explain "What is national self-confidence." In conclusion, I only hope that readers must recognize one point: that is, those who, on the one hand, advocate restoration, advocate national essence, and advocate idol worship, and on the other hand, oppose new ideological movements, oppose the critical spirit, and oppose freedom of speech, are definitely not those who promote the power of national self-confidence. On the contrary, they are simply the grave diggers of the national liberation movement!</p>
<h3>Chinese History Bibliography</h3>
<p>— Ying Puhan</p>
<p>Compiled by Zheng Hesheng, Published by The Commercial Press</p>
<p>The history of our country is a record of the activities of our ancestors, and we all have a necessity to fully understand it. Without this knowledge, we cannot truly understand the position we are in today. However, to understand the past and comprehend the present, we must rely on a "general history." Mr. Liang Qichao, a historian of our country, once intended to compile a refined and complete "General History of China" "to serve as a reference for the activities of the general public in modern times." Unfortunately, most of his life was spent in officialdom, so this great plan was never realized. Needless to say, this is a great regret. Until now, we simply do not have a refined and complete history of our own country, so to understand the evolution of our nation, there is really no better way than to directly read the books of the history section.</p>
<p>However, the way to study lies first in finding a path; reading history is certainly no exception. Bibliography is the gateway to reading, and the bibliography of the history section is the gateway to reading history. This Chinese History Bibliography compiled by Mr. Zheng Hesheng is one of the good gateway books to reading the books of the Chinese history section.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into ten chapters: (1) Origins of Ancient History, (2) Position of the History Section, (3) Origins and Development of the History Section, (4) Formal Records of the History Section, (5) Supplementary Records of the History Section, (6) Contemporary Records of the History Section, (7) On the Classification of the History Section, (8) Classification of Historical Materials, (9) On Historical Styles, (10) Conclusion. In the introductory examples, the compiler says, "The first chapter briefly describes the origins of historical books in our country, in order to rectify their foundation. The second and third chapters describe the position and origin of the history section, in order to generalize its essentials. The fourth, fifth, and sixth chapters describe the different categories of historical records, in order to glimpse their nuances. The formal records show their similarities, the supplementary records show their completeness, and the contemporary records show their changes. With these three aspects complete, the different categories can be generally understood. The seventh chapter describes the classifications of the history section by various scholars after Liu Zhiji, which have not been actually recorded, so it is called 'On'. ... The eighth and ninth chapters describe the classification of historical materials and historical styles, which briefly show the current scholars' division and combination of the history section, which is also a variation of the bibliography of the history section. The tenth chapter first describes the recording of the ancient people, in order to correct their errors, and then establishes a classification of the history section, in order to understand its origins." After reading, the reader can understand the general idea of the book.</p>
<p>The history of the bibliography of the history section in our country has been very long, such as the historical records of past dynasties and the Siku Quanshu Summary Catalogue and the Book List and Answers, all those who study history must practice recitation and understand them thoroughly. In addition to relying on the writings of previous scholars to make a systematic compilation, the compiler occasionally adds his own opinions and corrects them, or draws lessons from Europe and the West, completely changing the old habits, so there are many places of innovation. Now, please list a few of the most important points below to see the value of this book:</p>
<p>(1) Discernment of Gains and Losses—The item of False History is the most unreliable. Throughout the dynasties, catalogers of bibliography, either because of being confined to old theories or because of their circumstances, did not dare to openly criticize and correct them. In this book, the compiler distinguishes it under the item of False History in the Origins and Development of the History Section, saying: "False History records the history of false dynasties, which has the same meaning as Hegemonic History, and it does not matter who wrote it. The Siku Quanshu Summary Catalogue uses Later People's Records for the Chronicles and Self-written for False History, so the History of Yue and the Brief History of Korea are attached to the end. The names of Hegemonic and False are the most unreliable. Emphasizing the internal and belittling the external, although there is the righteousness of praise and blame in the Spring and Autumn Annals, respecting this and disparaging that actually loses the balance of the historian. Once the views of different customs are deeply rooted, the source of assimilation is difficult to discern. Moreover, each regards its own as correct, and all are the legitimate dynasty. 'Cao Wei refers to Wu and Shu as bandits, the Northern Dynasty refers to the Eastern Jin as usurpers, the South calls the North the Xuo Lu, and the North calls the South the Island Yi.' How can these be fair? However, those who were enemies at the time either wagged their tongues, and later generations should use history as a mirror and balance. They should not trace their prejudices and instruct later generations. Therefore, Ziyuan's theory of history only distinguishes between correct and miscellaneous, and does not say true or false. This shows that he is impartial, and success or failure is clearly revealed, without the need for praise or criticism. Once the host and guest are judged, good and evil are difficult to distinguish. Therefore, there is much to discuss about the category of false history."</p>
<p>(Pages 24) Also, the compiler corrects the Siku Quanshu Summary Catalogue, saying: "The Siku Quanshu Summary Catalogue, which came out later, has the most detailed classification regulations, but errors are also unavoidable. For the time being, let's take the old-style history item meanings as an example. For example, the Dongguan Hanji and the Later Han Shu of various families are not included in the official history in the old records, but the Summary Catalogue classifies them as separate histories. The category examples of separate histories say: 'The Dongguan Hanji and the supplementary remains of the Later Han Shu are all official histories; however, the books are incomplete, and they are not listed in the official history, so they are generally included in this category.' Also, the category examples of official history say: 'The books of annotations and explanations of various histories are all classified according to their categories. If Mao Guojin Jiang Zhiqi's Jin Shu deletes and modifies the original text, the Song Shi Xin Bian belongs to the books themselves. The Five Dynasties History Supplement and the Five Dynasties History Missing Texts are also added to the books themselves, and such examples are all included in separate histories.' Looking at the definition of separate history, it is a book that 'does not reach the official history and does not reach the miscellaneous history'. However, where is its boundary? The above-listed histories are originally in the form of biographies, but because the books are incomplete and are not listed in the official history, deleting and modifying the original text, adding to the books themselves, suddenly calling them separate histories, then what is the system? The classification standards are not consistent, so there are biographies in the hegemonic history. There are chronicles. There are records of events from beginning to end. Because it records the heroes, it is called the hegemonic history, and the rest of the miscellaneous histories and separate histories are similar. And among the biographies and chronicles, there are also books such as hegemonic history, miscellaneous history, and separate history. How can it be a standard for example categories?..." (Pages 234-235) Such discernment of gains and losses is evident everywhere in this book; only one example is prepared here, so it will not be listed further.</p>
<p>(2) The Compiler's Classification of the History Section—Whether it is the formal record, the supplementary record, or the contemporary record of the history section in our country. This is really due to the lack of scientific nature in the classification of academics in our country. Moreover, since recent times, geology, archeology, and other sciences have gradually developed, and the number of discovered underground physical historical materials has also increased. Thus, the scope of the history section has suddenly expanded. The re-compilation and amendment of the old history section catalog has become an urgent matter in academia. In view of this, the compiler of this book specifically took lessons from Europe and the West and established a "Classification of Future History Section Items" in the conclusion to show scholars. Its method divides history into three: "Historical Books", "Historical Compilations", and "Historical Objects". Historical books can be divided into two categories: Those that describe various events, integrating and interacting with each other are called "General History". General history can be divided into two categories: Those that take the era as the unit, such as the official histories and chronicles after the Historical Records. Those that take events as the standard, such as the Comprehensive Collection of Institutions, the Comprehensive Study of Documents, and the Histories of Events from Beginning to End. Those that describe a part of historical events, such as transportation, academics, customs, or art, are called "Special History". Such as the History of Chinese Transportation, the Song Wu Xue'an, the Ming Ru Xue'an, the Materials of Oriental Art, the History of Chinese Customs, etc. As for historical compilations, they can also be divided into three categories: Those that describe miscellaneous events without classified examples, such as the Classic of Mountains and Seas, the Discourses of the States, the Strategies of the Warring States, and magazines and newspapers, are called "Miscellaneous Records". Those that compile in order with clues to be found, such as various political essentials, meetings, and encyclopedias, are called "Collected Records". Those that have notes, supplements, textual research, explanations, tables, and records, which can supplement the deficiencies of the original history, such as the Historical Records Zhiyi, the Annotations of the History of the Three Kingdoms, etc., are called "Supplementations". As for artifacts, charts, specimens, and models, there is no difference in importance from historical books and historical compilations. However, they must take the era as the standard or take the region as the destination, then the outline is clear and the items are well-organized. The so-called taking the era as the standard, or taking the names of Tang, Yu, the Three Dynasties, Qin, and Han as the heading, and then listing in detail how many kinds of historical books, how many categories of historical compilations, and how many historical objects are in a certain era. Then, in the historical books, which is the general history and which is the special history; in the historical compilations, which is the miscellaneous record, which is the collected record, and which is the supplement; in the historical objects, which is the specimen, which is the model, and which is the chart. And then further cite which is the direct general history, which is the horizontal general history. In the special history, which is transportation, which is academics, etc. ... As for those who take the region as the destination, it is also the same, or by province, or by county ... it is all possible." (Pages 237-238) This classification method is outlined and tied, readers can understand it at a glance, it is truly the most concise of the historical section bibliographies of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>In addition, the shrine bibliography of Sun Xingyan of the Qing Dynasty is often ignored by the world, but the compiler highly praises it, one is that "it really opens a precedent in bibliography, and it is proper in academics"; the other is that "it is simple and essential, sparse but not leaky." Indeed, Sun's bibliography can be unique and independent of the region, and it really has the value of being respected; and from this, we can also see the compiler's brilliant insight.</p>

<h3>Briefly Talk About Pictorials</h3>
<p>— Yu Hui</p>
<p>Sixty to eighty percent of the materials in Chinese pictorials are cut from foreign pictorials, but Chinese pictorials are of a different type among the pictorials in the world.</p>
<p>When you walk into a bookstore, among the many books and magazines, the first to attract your attention must be those pictorials with bright colors. The covers of these pictorials are mostly printed with the charming photos of some movie stars and socialites of the time, or sensual nudes (please note the recent advertisement of a certain pictorial, their most important thing is the cover of a nude painting). This seems to be a regulation, and it is also sufficient to represent a certain trend in the publishing industry now.</p>
<p>We do not deny that pictorials are relatively leisure-oriented publications, but we cannot deny that pictorials are rich in propaganda and reporting functions. Pictorials report and instruct everything with figurative materials, so they are more clear and practical than abstract articles. Just because it requires readers to think deeply, just because it is easy to touch, figurative, so it can penetrate into all levels of society, and can have the greatest effect. He is invisibly taking on the task of subtle influence between readers without knowing it. In short, pictorials are an important publication.</p>
<p>The world's most famous pictorial in England is "Illustrated London News" (weekly), seeing its simple cover with a classical demeanor, you can know how different it is from Chinese pictorials. Here you can't find the charming photos of beauties, you can't see big feet and breasts, and each issue has an article on archeology, and the unearthed antiquities leave their figure here, the Royal Academy of Sciences, light, electricity, etc. inventions, and the introduction of customs and life in various places. Besides, you can also see a content that is full, but the writing is so relaxed, which is very commensurate with those pictures. Naturally, they are never stingy to spend many pages on the photos of major events at home and abroad. The American "New York Times Midweek Pictorial" (weekly) also has special features, just like the American personality. Here, the five colors are colorful, and attention is also paid to the new-style clothing and home furnishings, or the charming photos of a certain state queen, but the largest part is still the reports of current events at home and abroad and the introduction of scientific inventions. The French "Illustation" (weekly) is the same as the British "London Pictorial", without thighs and the like, most of the illustrations have detailed explanations, and the articles published are also rich in timeliness and interest. In addition, the German "Berliner Illiutrierte Zeitung" (weekly) after Hitler took power; each issue is full of photos of artillery, bombers, new-style submarines, and brave Nazi party members. The photos of the general assembly exercises are printed out with large sheets of paper. The above are all very famous pictorials, and what they have in common is the attention to current events at home and abroad. Each issue is very fresh. When King Alexander of Yugoslavia and Foreign Minister Barthou of France were killed in Marseille, a week later, the American and British pictorials had photos of the time, even a glimpse before the killing. They often buy photos at a great price. And the reason why most of them are weeklies (the world's famous pictorials can be said to be all weeklies), I think it is nothing more than the reason for emphasizing the timeliness of the photos.</p>
<p>But Chinese pictorials, in contrast, are quite disappointing to us. Just a little attention to their covers, which are the most attractive to readers, is given to some beauties, and you can see the attitude and intention of the pictorial editors. Some even use his own characteristics to publish comparisons between pig lungs and human buttocks, portraits of high-achieving students of a certain school (in addition, there are some boring literary works), etc., taking the vulgar as interesting, and taking the boring as serious, and emphasizing nude paintings and the shadows of celebrities and socialites, although it is said to be adapted to the needs of readers, but we can't help but admit that the formation of this interest in the reader layer has a close relationship with these magazines. Today, when you walk into a young man's room, nine out of ten people must have films of some movie stars or mermaids posted or hung on their desks. Chinese youth still have this problem and this mood in this difficult environment. Today's pictorial editors cannot shirk their responsibility. As for what kind of attitude the pictorial should take, I have mentioned it briefly above. In short, if we don't focus on enlightenment and reporting, I would rather the Chinese publishing industry have no pictorials.</p>

<p>A Contribution</p>
<h3>What is Expected of the National Goods Promotion Team</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Unemployment is the most painful thing in life. The unemployment of poor young people is especially the pain of life in the world. Unemployment due to dereliction of duty or drowning in duty is certainly not to be pitied, and unemployment due to the downturn in the market is especially to be pitied in the world. The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center has been established for eight years, and it has introduced unemployed young people in the thousands. Up to now, it still feels that it has reached the end of the mountains and rivers, and there is no way to enter. However, the unemployed are coming in like a landslide and tsunami. It is becoming more and more difficult to find a job, and the number of job seekers is increasing. Some people fill their stomachs with sesame cakes every day, and some people sleep in the wind and building. The colleagues in the center have forgotten the difficulty and greatness of their responsibilities and have done their best to find a way out for the unemployed. However, there are too many monks and too little porridge. I don't know how many people are embracing the corner. The existing situation is limited, and it is not enough to accommodate so many unemployed people unless a new road is opened. Everyone says that the resumption of business is essential to promoting national goods. It is better to take action than to sit and talk. Why don't the unemployed masses in the society use their hearts and efforts to make them self-sufficient? It is best to carry on small capital. This idea was advocated by Tian Xuwosheng, a senior member of the national goods industry, and there have been those who followed up one after another, so there is an organization for the national goods promotion. Under the guidance of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, it was implemented at the beginning of this month. First, ten people were selected for trial. The start-up cost is about five yuan per person, and the cost is fifty yuan, and the way of life for ten people has been opened. On the one hand, it promotes the sales of national products, and on the other hand, it promotes the livelihood of one person and one family. It has been less than ten days, and the society calls it that. There is a Mr. Sheng who left a book at the center, spending fifty yuan to increase the amount, so that ten more people can be expanded. It is no less than adding ten fresh troops to national goods. Who is not as good as me in loving goodness? If the most meritorious class is available, then ten people, hundreds of people, and thousands of people are not difficult, and the pity of the unemployed may be reduced. The bleakness of the national goods industry also has the hope of recovery after being stripped to the extreme. All those who are members of the team should work hard, be honest and self-sworn, in order to open up the difficult situation. I hope that those who love the country and are enthusiastic about national goods will sympathize with this move, like the response of a raft and drum, so that the unemployed youth who are in distress and helpless will all have the opportunity to support themselves, and the vitality of the national goods industry will also be able to sprout. What is the relationship? On the eve of the opening of the National Goods Promotion Team, I would like to suspend this meaning to pray for its success.</p>
<h3>Promote National Goods and the Industrial Revolution</h3>
<p>— Qiao Yunsu</p>
<p>Last month, the Ministry of Finance promulgated an order to abolish the silver dollar and implement legal currency. This is a major change in the history of Chinese finance. On the one hand, the government is preventing the outflow of northern silver, but on the other hand, it is because the commercial, economic, and rural economies have become extremely withered. It resolutely used the new currency to revive and adjust the exhausted financial state of the country. According to bankers, currency inflation is actually because countries are trying to buy silver endlessly. Our traitorous merchants, thinking that great profit is in it, do not hesitate to damage the vitality of the national economy and desperately help the perpetrators. In this way, according to the opinions of the majority of people, national products can easily become active, and at the very least, there is hope that the number of imports and exports can be balanced. This is a great help to the promotion of national goods that has been promoted by the government for many years, and we are very fortunate for the future of the national economy. However, on the other hand, we need to know that promoting national goods is a movement that should be paid attention to in many aspects. For example, everyone has shown sincerity in using national goods, but there are no excellent national products to replace them, or perhaps the goods can be compared with foreign goods, but the price is extremely expensive, or even certain foreign goods are flooding the market, but there is no invention equivalent to a certain foreign goods, and the price is extremely expensive. It is not the intention of national goods merchants to deliberately raise the price, or be implicated by the blood capital! Or be hampered by manufacturing technology! Everywhere is a major obstacle to promoting national goods. Speaking of this, we have to speculate on the phrase "industrial revolution"; there is such a paragraph on the People's Livelihood Principle ... If it is a society where industry is not yet developed, then on the one hand, develop national capital, important production and public utilities belong to the public, then encourage private enterprises, protect private capital under the original state of capitalist socialization, so that the industry develops towards the path of industrial revolution! ... These few words, of course, refer to the rough branches and abandoned them. To solve the maze of important production undertakings, I have to distort it a bit. Roughly "improve production" and "reduce prices" can also be attached to the banner of the "industrial revolution", right? Now, those who need to engage in production undertakings also need to move towards the path of revolution. How to improve the excellent products so that they can compete with foreign goods, and how to reduce the price to ease the burden of users. I recently felt that two school supplies are really not clever. One is wax paper, which has a trend that foreign goods must be used. Among the national products, there are those with a price of three yuan per tube, which can be printed to less than one or twenty sheets, and the skylight is opened, and it cannot be printed again. The other is chalk, which, as soon as it reaches the blackboard, breaks into pieces, losing money and wasting time! It is even more necessary to reduce the enthusiasm of users. Although this cannot represent the general national wax paper chalk, the two kinds that I have received are not blatantly proclaiming the only national product - we want to solve these problems, we should hope for the industrial revolution, and the tools of the industrial revolution must be included in "science" - because only science - is the general key to saving the country.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Love to Use National Goods</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>This time, the Malayan overseas Chinese athletes returned to the country to participate in the 6th National Games, showing their skills and talents, and all circles expressed their welcome. The Shanghai Wuhe Weaving Factory, the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, the China Enamel Factory, and the China Chemical Industry Society also hosted banquets. The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, due to its responsibilities, specially invited the athletes to visit Beijing. They left on October 23 and stayed at the Central Military Academy. They returned to Shanghai on the 26th. The Commission specially provided vehicles and provided lunch. They were attached to the express train that left at 8:00 am. Choucheng went to Beijing to petition the Administrative Yuan Health Department for new drugs, and also took this train back to Shen. In the meantime, he had a pleasant conversation with Deputy Team Leader Wang Jingcheng. The situation regarding the promotion of national goods is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingcheng is from Fujian and grew up abroad. He has never returned to the country. He is thirty-seven years old this year and has a face similar to that of Team Leader Hu Wenhu. In Malaya, he serves as a committee member of schools, newspapers, etc., and is enthusiastic about public welfare. According to him, 95% of the 100-plus athletes returned to the country for the first time. When they arrived in Beijing the other day, they visited various places and felt that the buildings were magnificent and the roads were clean, no less than those abroad. The compatriots from all walks of life were kind and friendly to them, and they were very grateful. The products of various factories in the country that they saw were no less than the imported products, and the value was much cheaper. Most of these goods have never been seen abroad. I hope that in the future, we can find a way to promote them to the Nanyang area, because the overseas Chinese compatriots love their motherland more than anyone else, and they hope that the motherland will be rich and strong in order to improve their status. The same goods, that is, national goods are more crude and slightly more expensive than foreign goods: they are also willing to buy national goods, let alone not crude and inexpensive. The two kinds of items obtained in Beijing this time are the most precious. One is the sword presented by Zhang Zhizhong, the director of education of the Central Military Academy, on behalf of Chairman Chiang. Although I am not a martial artist, I should also cherish it. The other is the Nanjing-produced Jingduan satin. Although it is rarely seen on the market, our overseas Chinese compatriots can buy it and make it into items to keep as a souvenir.</p>
<p>On the train, some athletes were looking through the map of the capital to indicate the places they visited this time. Some were blowing the accordion and singing various majestic and famous songs. Some were recalling the sports situation to explain the secret of winning the competition. They were innocent and happy. Passing through Changzhou, I saw those who sold castor wood combs, and told them that this is a famous product of Changzhou, and they scrambled to buy them one after another, packed them in brocade boxes, and prepared to give them to relatives and friends. Passing Wuxi, I saw the clay Buddhas sold by the vendors, including the idols of the three brothers Liu, Guan, and Zhang, the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, the Crazy Monk Ji Gong, and Yang Guifei bathing. They all said that they had never seen them before. After being told various names, they also competed to buy them and placed them in front of them for appreciation. Arriving in Suzhou, in addition to the hawkers selling melon seeds and candies, there were also flower girls holding white orchids and shouting. Because of these kinds of goods, they were also rarely seen abroad, and they all bought them to try them, with a bunch of flowers hanging on their chests, and the whole car was fragrant. I said, "What you bought are all genuine national goods, and they are famous specialties of Chang, Xi, and Su." They all said, "We are willing to promote national goods, and this trip can be said to be worthwhile."</p>
<h3>The Achievement of the Women's National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Tian Xu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>The Shen Bao National Products Weekly published on November 18th of the 24th year contained a report from the National Products Trade Bureau: In the past ten months of this year, the value of imported foreign perfumes and cosmetics totaled 356,318 customs gold units, equivalent to 634,313 national currency units, a figure considered alarming. However, compared to the previous year, it has indeed decreased by more than half, which cannot be denied as an achievement of the Women's National Products Year. Reading the 71st issue of "National Products New Sound" published by the Joint Association on January 15th of this year, it stated that from January to November of the 23rd year, the value of imported foreign perfumes and cosmetics totaled 818,640 customs gold units, equivalent to 1,580,898 national currency units. Averaging over eleven months, the monthly outflow of money was over 143,400 yuan. This year, the ten-month average is only over 63,400 yuan, a reduction to 44%, indicating that among every 100 people, 56 no longer use foreign goods. Generally, changes in customs originate from the concepts of public preference and aversion. Since more than half of the people no longer use foreign goods, it is certain that more than half of the people prefer to use domestic goods. The small number of people who still use foreign goods mostly do so because they are too infatuated with Europeanization and have always been accustomed to using luxury goods, feeling that domestic goods cannot compare. Therefore, they have no choice but to abandon domestic goods and choose foreign goods. This is similar to eating rice; those who are accustomed to eating first-class machine-polished japonica rice will not be forced to eat brown rice, even if it is given to them for free. Therefore, I believe that the most important key to recovering outflowing profits lies in the products of domestic goods factories. Focusing solely on cutting corners and reducing materials and competing on price is a misconception. The proverb "cheap goods are not good, and good goods are not cheap" is indeed an accurate and unshakeable common principle. A rice store that only sells inferior or second-class rice instead of first-class rice, even if it uses cheap prices to attract customers in the market, will definitely not attract wealthy households to buy. This can be stated with certainty. Some say that the decrease of more than half in imported cosmetics is due to reduced purchasing power. However, taking the example of the Family Industrial Cooperative, this year's decrease compared to last year is only 10%, while imported goods have decreased to 44%, indicating that it is not due to purchasing power. However, in the future, almost all imported goods will increase in price by more than 20%, and domestic goods will also inevitably increase in price. The two will inevitably show a clear example of one growing and the other declining. Next year, it may be possible to change the trade balance from import surplus to export surplus, which is not necessarily impossible.</p>
<h3>National Products Tonics</h3>
<p>— Fu Sheng</p>
<p>In winter, in order to resist the invasion of cold and enhance physical strength for the coming spring, it is necessary to take some tonics. In this new era, the most common tonic is fish liver oil, because its strengthening power is relatively significant. However, imported fish liver oil easily costs three or four yuan per bottle, which only the wealthy can afford. Those who are economical dare not try it, and it also feels a little regrettable to send large profits into the pockets of foreigners.</p>
<p>Since the Wuzhou Pharmacy put forward the slogan "to give everyone the opportunity to benefit," it has won the sympathy of the general public. At the same time, Wuzhou has intensified its research and improvement of its own malt extract and milky-white fish liver oil. As a result of hard work, the effectiveness and taste of its products are now no less than those of imported products, and the selling price is less than half of that of imported products. I hope that in the future, those who take foreign fish liver oil will switch to domestic fish liver oil, which will not only save money but also gain health from taking domestic tonics, which is also valuable health.</p>

<h3>To Mr. Fu Ning Hongchun</h3>
<p>— (Editor)</p>
<p>Your letter has been gratefully received. The vegetable oil lamp was invented by Zhong Lingjun. This pressurized oil lamp has been approved for a five-year patent by the Ministry of Industry. It is inexpensive, saves oil, safe, hygienic, and bright, possessing all five qualities. Moreover, it uses products produced in the country's rural areas, which can increase agricultural income by more than 10 million yuan per year as fuel, a huge benefit. The China Oil Lamp Co., Ltd. has been established, with Chen Zuyi and Yao Shou Kang preparing for it. The preparation office is located at 218 Shandong Road. Recently, the preparation is nearing completion, and the Fuya Electric Factory at 162 Lane 503, Huade Road, is preparing to produce the lamps, which will soon be launched on the market. We greatly admire your concern for the cause of national products and use our knowledge to reply in brief. We hope you will examine it carefully.</p>
<h3>The Welcome and Introduction of the "China Oil Lamp"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shi</p>
<p>In large cities, electric lights provide illumination all night, while in the rural areas of the interior, kerosene lamps are still popular. Not to mention that electric lights are not easy to install, even if there are electric lights, poor farmers cannot afford to enjoy this bright happiness. Villagers call kerosene lamps "foreign lamps" because they come from abroad. The burning kerosene is called "foreign oil" because it is also an imported product. If every household in the country uses one foreign lamp on average—and there are actually more than that number—then more than 100 million lamps are needed. The loss from foreign lamps is still limited, but the loss from foreign oil every day is truly incalculable.</p>
<p>Now there is good news: exquisite and practical China oil lamps have appeared. A month ago, I saw a news item in the newspaper about someone inventing a China oil lamp, and the day before yesterday, I saw proof of the fact at a friend's house, which made me extremely happy. This oil lamp is a product of the Shanghai China Oil Lamp Company, with the "Bagua" (Eight Trigrams) brand trademark, and is entirely a domestic product. The burning material is not kerosene, not foreign oil, but soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and peanut oil, which are readily available in rural areas. The light it emits is brighter than that of foreign lamps, and the style, whether as a table lamp or a hanging lamp, is also extremely beautiful. The bulb is even more clean and bright, which I truly admire and makes me happy. I am confident that in the near future, this Bagua China oil lamp will become popular throughout the country. In my opinion, its advantages also include the following:</p>
<p>Using a China lamp and burning China oil, especially raw materials inherent in rural areas, not only is the price cheaper than foreign oil, but it can also reduce a huge loss; advantage one. Since it is called kerosene, it naturally has kerosene gas. If the fire is not extinguished after sleeping, there will be black gas in the nose in the morning. People who do not enjoy the happiness of electric lights have this experience. Now, switching to soybean oil can avoid this problem. If rapeseed oil is burned, it will even have the effect of improving eyesight; advantage two. Kerosene gas is most harmful to the human body, especially to the lungs. For people with lung diseases, it is simply adding insult to injury. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil are ordinary foods, and not only have no kerosene gas, but also have no smoke; advantage three. Kerosene catches fire easily, and fires caused by kerosene lamps being knocked over occur everywhere. Soybean oil does not have this disadvantage; advantage four.</p>
<p>Since the Bagua brand China oil lamp has all these advantages, how can it not be welcomed and happily introduced? Some people often lament that Chinese people love to use foreign goods. In fact, Chinese people are not unpatriotic and do not dislike using Chinese goods. As long as there are suitable substitutes, they will naturally be loved and used. Taking this lamp as an example, everyone agrees with it. I have introduced this lamp to many farmers, and after they have seen the actual proof, no one does not agree with and happily use it. Everyone wants to ask me to buy one for them, and everyone also says that the Chinese are longer suffering than before. It can be seen that patriotism is an innate conscience.

<h3>Proper Treatment of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Physician Yuan Yimin</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a difficult-to-treat condition. This is undeniable by anyone. The reason for its difficulty in treatment is partly due to the difficulty in completely eradicating the gonococcus, and also partly due to the patient's failure to strictly adhere to a regimen of health preservation. Moreover, sometimes it is due to incomplete treatment, etc., all of which are sufficient to prolong the disease and progress to a chronic stage. At this point, the disease has spread to other areas. If treatment is not properly managed, the hope of a permanent cure is lost. At this time, the gonococcus is often deeply hidden in the mucous membrane. Outwardly, there are no subjective symptoms whatsoever. Even the patient himself does not feel much discomfort. However, every time the body is overworked or excessively drinks alcohol, it is sufficient to recur. In the past, the treatment of gonorrhea was limited to internal medicine, washing, and injection. In recent years, the progress of medicine has been remarkable. Such as the injection of pigments and mixed vaccines, the strong internal use of membrane-permeable bactericidal agent "Mesaltropin," shortwave diathermy and the latest turbid treatment machine, as well as the injection of local gonorrhea serum "Gonoserol," etc. All these are excellent. The efficacy is superior to all treatments. It is indeed the most appropriate method for treating gonorrhea. However, this method must be performed by experienced specialists. so that the dosage and condition can be accurately judged. For example, the Chunzai Hospital at No. 66 French Concession in this city employs many physicians. Women's examinations are assisted by female doctors. Electrotherapy equipment is fully available. Its equipment is complete, and its treatment is appropriate. For the time being, no other hospital can be compared to it.</p>
<h3>The Composition of Opium and Its Physiological Effects</h3>
<p>— Physician She Lei</p>
<p>The unripe poppy capsule is cut open with a knife, and the fluid that flows out is taken and allowed to dry to form opium. The main plant salt in it is morphine. In addition to morphine, opium also contains papaverine, codeine, narcotine, thebaine, etc., totaling eighteen kinds of alkaloids. Among them, the first three are all related to morphine. Although thebaine is chemically close to morphine, its medicinal properties suggest that it should be classified under the strychnine group.</p>
<p>The main component of opium is morphine. Morphine is a phenanthrene derivative that can paralyze the brain. In particular, reflex movements caused by pain are also paralyzed. Therefore, medical practitioners unanimously recognize it as an effective analgesic and constantly use it to achieve the purpose of pain relief. However, after the application of morphine, the reflex excitability of the spinal cord is enhanced. In certain animals, it can cause rigidity, just like strychnine. The results of experiments by Japanese scholar Kenzo Tamura showed that the reason for such rigidity is the crystalline nitromorphine produced in the body by the acidification of morphine, or the amorphous substance produced by its acidification. Its effect is similar to a mixture of strychnine and picrotoxin. If this convulsive poison is further acidified, it loses its toxicity, and acidification is especially rapid in warm-blooded animals. Therefore, the phenomenon of convulsions is rarely seen. However, convulsions can occur if a large amount of nitromorphine is administered or injected into the subarachnoid space. Other anesthetics, such as papaverine, codeine, and narcotine, have weaker anesthetic effects than morphine.</p>
<h3>Choosing Stomach Medicine</h3>
<p>— (Physician Ma Fangweng)</p>
<p>The usual symptoms of stomach diseases are nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, heartburn, stomach pain, and abdominal distension. Those who suffer from this disease not only hinder diet and nutrition, but also suffer greatly from nerve damage. If left untreated, the stomach wall will ulcerate, which may lead to gastric ulcer. Examining suitable drugs for these symptoms, none is better than alkaline agents. Among alkaline preparations, the most outstanding and superior is "Wei Bao." "Wei Bao" has various medicinal effects that exceed ordinary preparations, which are briefly described below. (1) Regular use is harmless. (2) It has a particularly strong analgesic and antiemetic effect. (3) It promotes digestion and regulates the physiological functions of the stomach. (4) It can neutralize stomach acid and absorb harmful substances in the stomach and intestines. (5) It is fragrant and palatable, making it easy to take. With such excellent effects, it is more than worthy of being praised as a sacred medicine for stomach diseases. This medicine costs two yuan per box and is sold at Ren Shou Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, this city.</p>
<h3>Effective Medicine for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Physician Jiang Guofan)</p>
<p>The treatment of gonorrhea is now most effectively and rapidly achieved through the injection of mixed vaccines and pigments, as well as electrotherapy with shortwave diathermy and the latest turbid treatment machine. However, there are cases where people live far away in the countryside, or are busy with work, and do not have enough time to seek medical treatment, or are limited by other factors. In such cases, self-treatment is the only option. For self-treatment, ordinary patients can only use internal medicine and local injection methods. For internal medicine, the best choice is a drug with strong membrane-permeable bactericidal power, as well as analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, such as Mesaltropin. Since its grand medicinal effect in treating gonorrhea has been praised by physicians Zhang Shouming, Chen Peiji, and Yuan Yimin, it has long been famous in the medical community, and even ordinary patients are happy to use it. As for external medicine, ordinary people ultimately use the drug solution sterilization method. In this method, doctors can carefully observe the patient's condition to determine the amount of injection, the concentration of the drug solution, and the duration of retention. If patients perform it themselves, it is difficult to be so accurate. Now, the German Mann &amp; Co. Pharmaceutical Factory has invented "Gono-Serol," which is made with gonorrhea serum and schuessler salts. It has an automatic immunization effect. Injecting it into the local urethra is equivalent to injecting a mixed gonorrhea vaccine, which is truly a good medicine for gonorrhea. (Both Mesaltropin and Gono-Serol are sold at Ren Shou Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, this city. The former costs one yuan per box, and the latter costs two yuan and fifty cents per box. Editor.)</p>
<h3>Experiment on Sterilization and Treatment of Ringworm</h3>
<p>— (Physician Sun Zhiyao)</p>
<p>Although ringworm is a minor illness, if left untreated, it will spread and become stubborn ringworm, making treatment more difficult. There are many types of ringworm, such as favus, white ringworm, tinea cruris, and ichthyosis. There are also many over-the-counter medicines for treating ringworm. After clinical application, I believe that nothing is more effective than Misulzine. Here is an example for patients with ringworm. The patient, Mr. Xu, suffered from wet ringworm on his medical area and back. Due to time and location constraints, he could not undergo injection and electric therapy with artificial sun lamps and mercury stone silver lamps. He was only instructed to purchase Misulzine and apply it himself. After only two sentences, the disease was as if lost. There was not the slightest pathological scar at the affected area. Using this medicine has no foul taste and does not soil clothing. It can truly be called an excellent product. This medicine is now sold at Ren Shou Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, this city. Each box sells for only one yuan.</p>

<h3>Common Symptoms of Sexual Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Physician Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Sexual neurasthenia is originally a partial phenomenon of neurasthenia. It is named because it is specifically manifested in the genital area. However, its various common symptoms are also found in various parts of the body, not only in the genital area. Usually seen are insomnia, but its type is different. It may be a clear obstacle to falling asleep, or it may be the inability to sleep soundly and easy waking. The stimulation of the five senses is high, so there are often symptoms of hypersensitivity. In addition to pain, the head also has a feeling of heaviness and discomfort. Dizziness is felt after overwork and drinking. There is occasional belching and vomiting. The digestive system suffers from nervous indigestion. Constipation and diarrhea occur alternately. Patients are becoming increasingly thin, and the muscles are also loose. Fatigue is easily felt after work. This is a characteristic of this disease. Moreover, discomfort and weakness are very clear, so willpower is weak, mental concentration is difficult, and thinking and memory are reduced. Mental abilities are markedly impaired. If forced to engage in labor, the aforementioned ailments will increase significantly, and may even become a mental illness. However, the aforementioned ailments are part of the general symptoms of neurasthenia. In sexual neurasthenia, of course, diseases of the genital area are especially severe. I have already mentioned it before, so I will not repeat it here. In the past, this disease was only treated with drugs, and the effects were generally slow. In recent times, with the prevalence of electrical therapy, this disease has finally had the hope of a definite and rapid cure. Among electrical therapies, shortwave diathermy is especially good. As for drugs, organ therapy is quite valuable. Other drugs, such as egg yolk lecithin, organic phosphorus compounds, and aphrodisiacs, are also highly appreciated. Over-the-counter medicines such as Arolsen have been clinically used and have been quite effective. (Arolsen) is sold at Ren Shou Western Pharmacy, No. 1 Laodehang Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, this city. Each box costs one yuan and fifty cents. (Editor)</p>

<h3>Student Parade Petition in Peiping</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Students from fifteen public and private universities, including Peiping University in Beiping, gathered in front of Zhongnanhai Qianmen at 10 a.m. on the ninth of this month. Together they went to Jurentang to petition He Yingqin, opposing any facts that would divide national unity, demanding unity for national salvation, and safeguarding the integrity of the country. Immediately they lined up and paraded through the streets. There were more than a thousand students. In addition, there were five or six hundred students from Yenching and Tsinghua Universities outside Xicheng, but they were unable to enter the city because Xizhimen was closed by the police. This is the first student petition movement heard in the two or three years since the Shanghai Truce Agreement. According to reports, the Peiping authorities, fearing that it would cause "Sino-foreign disputes," have strictly instructed the principals of various schools to "take the initiative to guide and stop the students, maintain order, and not be incited. If there is any unruly behavior, the government will never tolerate it." We suddenly heard about the petition of students in Peiping, and it truly feels like Ding Lingwei returned as a crane, with a sense of "the scenery is the same, but people are different." Another generation has passed in the world, and one does not know where the tears should come from!</p>
<p>Recently, North China has been in turmoil with the so-called "autonomy issue." Some time ago, Tianjin saw the discovery of strange names such as "North China Anti-Communist Security Commander" and "People's Self-Defense Dare-to-Die Corps." This is clearly an act of rebellion against the country, and it would be most appropriate to apply the Emergency Criminal Law for Endangering the Republic of China. However, it did not encounter any obstruction, and it was only when the truly genuine people tore up their banners that the matter came to an end. This time, the purpose of the Peiping student parade was to safeguard national sovereignty. Fortunately, the police intervention was limited to using batons to drive them away. Otherwise, if any trouble were to arise, it would be another unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Central Daily News published an editorial stating that today's news censorship policy is extremely unreasonable. The country is in such a critical state, but the general public is still kept in the dark, which may be the result of the current unreasonable news censorship policy. This article was widely circulated among the general public. As a result, some people very much hope that the central government can reform the current news censorship policy. On the one hand, for the still un-dead popular sentiment, they also hope that the central government can connect with it and use it as a strong backing for diplomacy. This hope is indeed something that every member of the public desperately wants to see realized. Today's parade and petition of Peiping students can at least be said to be an expression of a part of the popular sentiment. This is completely different from the autonomy movement and the People's Self-Defense Dare-to-Die Corps, etc., initiated by another part of the so-called people in North China. I believe that the general public is holding a full of enthusiasm and sincerely hoping that the government can accept this precious gift.</p>
<h3>Older Sister</h3>
<p>— Ying Guangjun</p>
<p>Just thinking of my older sister fills me with immense unease. My older sister is currently trapped in a difficult situation, but I cannot help her to get out of her predicament sooner. Yet, when we were young, she helped us, her younger siblings, with so many things.</p>
<p>Speaking of my older sister, she was practically my second mother. At that time, our family was living the life of a large family. The women had to take turns cooking. The family farmed the land and hired monthly and yearly laborers. A lot of food had to be cooked. As soon as my mother went to work, my older sister became our mother. She took care of us with the utmost care. My younger sister would sometimes cry and fuss, which would irritate even me, but my older sister calmly took care of her. If it hadn't been for my older sister at that time, I really don't know</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>what we would have done. And my older brother, who was also four years younger than my older sister, would often quarrel with her. My older sister was only fifteen years old, but she was very capable of being a little mother.</p>
<p>In the evening, my mother would send us to bed and often say to us:</p>
<p>"Without your older sister, you wouldn't have been able to live to be so old. When you grow up, don't forget your older sister's kindness. Only then will you not fail to live up to her deep affection for you."</p>
<p>Yes, I still remember these words clearly to this day. I am sorry that I only remember my older sister's kindness, but I have not repaid even a bit of her deep affection for taking care of us back then. I am so sorry to my older sister.</p>
<p>When my older sister was sixteen years old, she learned to make shoes for us. My older brother and I would run around outside all day long, wearing out our shoes very quickly. My older sister had to make shoes for us every six or seven days. She would jokingly say to us:</p>
<p>"You two need to wear two pairs of iron shoes."</p>
<p>She also helped my mother make most of our clothes. If my mother didn't have such a virtuous and capable helper, she definitely wouldn't have been able to manage.</p>
<p>My older sister is a capable older sister, a good older sister, so whenever someone came to propose marriage, I would always oppose the matchmaker. At worst, I would scold them a few times, and at worst, I would hit them with a broom. Once, Grandpa Hu Er came to propose marriage, and I poured a bucket of water over his head. I even jumped up and down and shouted:</p>
<p>"You bad egg, get out! My older sister doesn't need you to be a matchmaker."</p>
<p>I begged my mother not to let my older sister marry and to keep her at home until she was old. She treats us so well that we can't bear to let her leave. But my mother wouldn't agree, and she couldn't explain why either. She just said that all girls have to get married when they grow up. We felt that my mother's words were too unfair to my older sister. My older sister helped her with so many things, but she was willing to marry her off.</p>
<p>We asked my older sister if she wanted to get married. My older sister always blushed and didn't say anything. When we pressed her, she would say:</p>
<p>"Older sister won't leave. Older sister can't bear to leave you."</p>
<p>After we told my mother this news, we mocked her:</p>
<p>"Mom, what do you say? Older sister herself said that she doesn't want to get married. Don't talk to the matchmaker about my older sister's marriage anymore."</p>
<p>Fortunately, because the families that the matchmakers proposed several times were not very suitable, my older sister's marriage was never settled. This went on until she was twenty-seven years old. By this time, we realized the mistake of keeping her from marrying before. We were also worried about her marriage and hoped that it could be settled as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But my older sister seemed to grow older day by day, and she rarely smiled on her face. But her love for us was still the same as before. During this time, because I was studying outside, I was not often at home every year. Once we met, we seemed particularly close. Remembering the old days, I often laughed unconsciously and teased my older sister:</p>
<p>"Now I won't keep you anymore. I even hope that more matchmakers will come."</p>
<p>In the winter of that year, when she was twenty-seven years old, Hu Er was still the matchmaker who settled my older sister's marriage. Because of her age, she didn't even get to enjoy the rights of a first marriage and was married to someone as a concubine. After she went there, she lived peacefully for more than two years. My older sister even gave birth to a daughter. Although she unfortunately died young, it didn't diminish her indifference to life. She was able to settle into her position and do her work.</p>
<p>Last summer, I received a letter from her saying that her husband was about to marry another woman. There was no reason given, probably because he was tired of the old and loved the new. She asked me to help her think of a solution, and she even said heartbreaking words, saying that she regretted getting married and that she had to suffer another torment in this world.</p>
<p>What can I do? Unless I go back and discuss it in person, but I don't want to return to my smog-filled hometown. Her predicament has therefore been delayed until today without being resolved. I am so sorry to my older sister.</p>
<h3>Skinning a Dead Ox</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>It was like joyful news of opening a granary for relief; when old man Shunfu's sick ox died, the illusion of smelling the aroma of beef aroused the heightened appetite of everyone. However, this was a perverse desire. That ox was more likely to have died of old age rather than sickness; and more likely to have died of exhaustion rather than old age. From the mouth of old man Shunfu, who was getting old with a head of gray hair, a pair of worried old eyes, and always clear snot under his nostrils, I learned the brief history of that dead ox.</p>
<p>Six years ago, old man Shunfu still had a mill, specializing in grinding flour, corn, soybeans, and many other grains for the people in the village. The family relied on the milling fees paid by people to make a living. Every day, every day, he put that ox on the millstone, dragging the large stone disc of two or three hundred catties, pacing incessantly. If it stopped even slightly, the crisp, stinging sound of a rattan whip would fall on its thin body. When the new wheat was harvested, until the end of the year, the mill was grinding grain for people all day and night without stopping. For the sake of life, old man Shunfu had to endure the hardship and had to spur his ox. The ox, for the sake of a little straw to fill its stomach and a little water, had to run spitting white foam, suffering the poisonous whip.</p>
<p>During a summer epidemic, old man Shunfu's seventeen-year-old son died of illness while grazing the ox outside. He mourned this son and arranged a grand funeral for him like an adult. The money was borrowed from Grandpa Shubo. However, the years deteriorated year by year, and he could not afford to repay the principal and interest. At the end of the year, the millstone was taken away to offset the debt. From then on, the mill was idle, old man Shunfu was idle, and the ox was also idle. However, this idleness caused by debt was precisely forming the panic that he and it had no means of support for their lives.</p>
<p>Food for the old couple, food for the ox. Where to get it? Where to get it? That heavy stone millstone, although old man Shunfu's family shed a lot of sweat for it, although the ox put in a lot of effort for it, it was always a kind of life, a kind of coexisting life! Finally, when sowing wheat last year, he pleaded again and again to the township director, the clan elder, and several large landowners, asking them to give him a little of the village's fields to cultivate. Thus, the lives of old man Shunfu and his old ox, which had worked hard for several years, were tightly bound to that plow again, pouring sweat into the hard yellow soil. Old man Shunfu, who was climbing back onto the line of life, still thought it was a gift of happiness, right? However, happiness and life are incompatible like ice and charcoal!</p>
<p>Old man Shunfu's ox finally fell ill, collapsed in the idle mill, staring with moist eyes, its belly pressed down, and it wouldn't eat even if straw was thrown to its mouth. The ox doctor walked up to it, shook his head, and left. One day, two days... it almost became a large specimen of an ox skeleton, and died.</p>
<p>"Alas, the ox is dead. I don't know when our two old bones will..." the old woman shrank in the corner of the mill, sighing old man Shunfu.</p>
<p>The young men skinning the dead ox were busy with all their might, with seven hands and eight feet, their hands stained with purplish-black blood, splattered on several small sharp knives. The bones and skin were collected by old man Shunfu to sell for money, and the meat was divided among everyone. Families who were stingy with firewood and seasonings didn't want any. My uncle also cut off a large piece and stewed it in an earthenware pot, adding fennel and soy sauce. When it was almost cooked, the whole house was filled with an enticing aroma that heightened the appetite. He told me to go to bed later to eat beef, but I politely declined. He thought I didn't eat dead beef for hygiene reasons. He explained that he added ginger and sugar to the pot. In the end, I still didn't taste it. I couldn't forget the sighing sentence:</p>
<p>"Alas, the ox is dead. I don't know when our two old bones will..."</p>

To go to the Yihong Courtyard quickly. And summon that lowly maid to see me. Qingwen is. Her delicate body is unwell, and she is tired and lazy. She is bored and upset. The maid says. Today, Madam has something to ask of you. She does not fix her appearance before leaving the room. When Madam sees her, she roars with anger. Your clothes are disheveled, your ribbons are trailing. Your hair is loose, pretending to be beautiful. You look like a prostitute with your lewd appearance. Tell me. What is Baoyu's recent situation? When she hears these words, she is surprised. It seems that. She has been plotted against and cannot escape blame. She says. I am completely ignorant of everything. Because I am a slave girl, I don't often go to the Second Master's inner chamber. Musk Moon and Xiren serve him diligently. They take care of him at all times. If you don't believe me. I swear to玉吾 that I am not promiscuous. Qingwen is eventually expelled by Madam. Regardless of her. The heat and cold in her body, she is completely exhausted. Poor her. With disheveled hair and a plain face, she is driven out. She cries and screams. As soon as she leaves the Yihong Courtyard, she dies of grievance.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor: The lively and enthusiastic society was organized not long ago and ended due to "environmental obstacles" and "fear of rumors." However, our heart for studying singing has not died. We have secretly reorganized into the "Lanman Art Society." This is unknown to the outside world. Several gentlemen who write song news occasionally send "non-factual" articles to your publication to play with us. When schools and families see this, something unfortunate will happen again. In the future, we hope that the gentleman will delete articles that are insulting to us, "Lively Art Society," and "Lanman Art Society." Our special promotion, Mr. Haifeng, is an exception.

<h3>"Hero of the Hour" Premieres Today</h3>
<p>Long anticipated, Yihua's sound masterpiece "Hero of the Hour" is a glorious contribution to improving the technical level of Chinese films. It is a problem work that dissects the reasons for the decline of industry and commerce and calls for justice for Chinese industry and commerce. At the same time, it is an unparalleled masterpiece completed with the hard work of most artists over a year. This film will be screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater at 9:15 tonight. All those who care about domestic films should not miss it.</p>

<p>A certain newspaper reported: The Wuhan Headquarters Film Division came to Shanghai to search for talent. Yuan Congmei and Wu Weiyun have already left, and Ding Wanlaitian and the famous cartoonist Wan Brothers will leave on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>It is not true that the Wan Brothers are going to Han. On the one hand, they already have a contractual relationship with the Star Company, and on the other hand, they are very busy with cartoons commissioned by other companies (such as the mosquito cartoon in "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside"); on the other hand, the Wan Brothers, in view of the fact that foreign cartoons have advanced to full-color sound, they are also working hard to research and want to make Chinese cartoons with full-color appear in the short term.</p>

<h3>A Spring "Dream" Under the "Peach Blossom" Tree</h3>
<p>Shanghai Company's Domestic Ice Hong Lin</p>
<p>The most interesting thing in life is dreaming. All romantic miracles, things that are impossible in the real world, can be done in the land of dreams.</p>
<p>The American film "A Night of Love" released in Shanghai last year, the young man played by Eddie Cantor, after being driven out of the Roman exhibition hall, wandered alone on the street, and was suddenly caught by the guards in the ancient Roman city. So he began all sorts of strange encounters: he was sometimes dragged to the auction house and sold as a slave; sometimes he was loved by the queen; sometimes he was in the palace full of pink and greasy fragrance and beautiful women like clouds, surrounded by porridge-like daughters; sometimes he was imprisoned in a gloomy and miserable hell... He experienced all the encounters in life, and the result was originally a big dream.</p>
<p>Shanghai Film Company's new work "Peach Blossom Dream," directed by Du Yu, is a song and dance film that has the same flavor as "A Night of Love." There is a large group of girls in that film, all of whom are poor girls who sell flowers and newspapers on the street, or wash clothes for others. They work hard every day and play together. Because of a chance encounter, they visited the magnificent song and dance performances of the rich, and everyone was tempted by a little superficial vanity. The most beautiful girl among them (played by Yin Mingzhu) went to the stream to wash clothes, sat under the peach blossom forest, and fell into a trance. She gradually fell into a dream. So this poor laundry girl suddenly became a popular song and dance queen, bossing around, wealthy and glorious, invincible, falling in love and enjoying herself, doing everything. But she fell into an irredeemable tragic situation, and woke up from the dream sadly. The housewife who was washing and mending was standing in front of her with angry eyes...</p>
<p>The world of dreams is the most beautiful and romantic. "Peach Blossom Dream" is the world of all absurd and romantic imaginations.</p>

<h3>Stimulating Shots in "Hero of the Hour"</h3>
<h3>A Collection of News Regarding the "New Style Drama Society"</h3>
<p>Mr. Wei Wei, the director of "National Duty," has come to Suzhou from Shanghai and has hired several new spoken drama actors, rehearsing on schedule every day.</p>
<p>The stage for the rehearsal of "National Duty" has been set up in the factory's photography studio, resembling a small theater in shape.</p>
<p>In the third act of "National Duty," there is a tense crowd scene, featuring a model of a giant ship. The art department has begun its construction, and its grand and lifelike appearance is quite similar to the final scene of "Roar, China!"</p>
<p>Mr. You Zhou, the playwright of the factory, has completed a screenplay titled "Stealing Noodles" and is currently preparing the procedures for initial and final review. It is planned that this screenplay will be one of the two projects to begin filming after "Miss Suzhou."</p>
<p>During the spare time from rehearsing "National Duty," they are actively training in Mandarin and rehearsing several world-renowned one-act plays, which are listed below:</p>
<p>"Roar," directed by Mr. Wei Wei, performed by the entire cast.</p>
<p>"The Rising of the Bright Moon," directed by Mr. Chen Shouqiu, performed by Wang Jing, You Zhou, and others.</p>
<p>"Thief," namely Sinclair's "The Man Who Lived Upstairs," directed by Wang Jing, starring Hong Ying.</p>
