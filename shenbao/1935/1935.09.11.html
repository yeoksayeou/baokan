<h3 id="c17">柳江礦案如何解决乎 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>河北臨榆縣境之華商柳江煤礦。處於特殊勢力之十。致其黑山窰礦區爲中日合辦之泰記煤礦公司所侵佔。此項爭議。歷時半載實業部與冀省府先後派員前往調查。股專員與津日領亦往返交涉數次。柳江房恊理且與泰記經理石田久友一再直接談判。然迄今猶是僵局。柳江公司股東多屬滬商以此案延宕未决。損失恭鉅。因於上星期日在滬召開股東大會。議决進行方案兩項。（一）籌謀司法解决。一面向河北法院控告泰記公司中國註冊人孫寶熙。一面向天津日本領事館控告泰記公司。據理力爭。（二）讓渡礦產。但以不損失國家主權及股東利益爲原則。柳江方面之最後態度業已决定。此項交涉當可具體化矣。</p>
<p>柳江與泰記今茲所爭者。爲柳江之李治礦以南及泰記之石門寨礦以東之張德勛礦區。土名黑山窰。該礦區爲一三角形。面積一千二百零七畝。民國三年七月二日。張德勛就該礦區繪具探礦圖。呈請第一礦務監督署準予試探。同年九月八日領到探礦執照。五年八月二日原人呈請改探爲採。同時呈請與李治之柳江礦區合併開採。九年十一月三日領到採礦執照。此爲柳江取得黑山窰礦權之經過。惟民國三年八月十日日人三谷末治郎。以泰記代表孫際午名義。呈睛試探石門寨煤確時。其探礦圖亦將黑山窰　入。民國五年泰記呈請改探。爲採民國六年三月領到採礦執照。當主管機關發給探礦執照時。以其與呈請在先之張德勛有重複情形。會令泰記於圖上批明。將黑山窰讓歸張德勛開採。柳江與泰記今茲所爭之優先權問題。卽起因於此。就事理論。柳江開採該礦。將近二十年。其間並無糾葛。迨今春發生爭議後。優先權之誰屬。亦已由主管機關之河北建設廳根據查勘結果。於四月廿九日指令確定其主權屬於柳江公司。乃泰記方面竟藉日警之力。利用所謂「治安調整之今日」。查封柳江公司在秦皇島之倉庫碼頭。其爲越軌實至顯然。</p>
<p>就現勢觀察。此案之解决。殆不外三種途徑。第一爲法律解决。此原屬解决糾紛之正道。柳江股東會亦曾有此决議。惟柳江與泰記代表於八月十五日在關東軍山海關特務機關處談判時。特務機關長儀我誠也未表贊同。臨榆縣長袁泰亦謂「事實與法理固應論及。但時勢亦須考慮。」可知法律之力有時而窮。其次爲中日合辦。此項主張出自儀我。日方並曾提出泰記三與柳江一之比率爲合辦之條件。此其意義。顯係否定柳江之大部分礦權。且一旦實行。難免合辦其名。把持其實。故柳江股東大會無此决議。其次爲讓渡。柳江與泰記雙方均有此種主張。泰記出價三十萬元之議。當有討價還價之餘地。在無可如何之情勢中。或不免出此一途。惟若是解决。則所謂不損國家主權。恐亦楮片上之希望而已。</p>

<p>（日內瓦）據法代表團消息、今晨抵此之法總理　伐爾實懷有解决意阿案之新建、將於午後提交國聯五國委員會、賴氏巳於今晨十一時與英外相霍爾晤談、內容嚴守秘密、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）法國國務總理賴伐爾今晨抵此後、當與英國外相霍爾會同討論總剛爭端和平解决之辦法、歷一小時餘始畢、霍爾旋卽與意國首席代表阿洛西會談、預定於本日傍晚、再與賴伐爾會商、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）賴伐爾總理於昨晚八時二十五分赴日內瓦、行前延見英意兩國大使、據晨報稱、法總理不僅為制裁問題憂慮、並懼英國對於制裁問題之堅决態度、對於多瑙河及東歐公約等歐洲問題之解决亦將產生嚴重之影響、巴黎晚報載羅馬電、墨索里尼曾向賴伐爾保證、意國並不反對國際共管阿比西尼亞、東菲戰役之延長、及意與英國發生衝突之危懼、漸使意國若干方面傾向接受和解、意國政府希望國聯五國委員會建議國際援助阿比西尼亞、俾置阿國於被保護地位並希望此項援助之細則、將由一九〇六年之三國條約簽約國决定云、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>— （王莎葩）</p>
<p>從前，男女的配合，是在封建制度的「父母之命，媒均之言」下結合的，不由你自已作主，因此男的女的，性情不合，都感受許多說不出的痛苦。近年來的男女，是都講「自由戀愛」了—照理：可以减少一切痛苦了，但是事實吿訴我們，不是這樣。在結婚以後，儘有許許多多鬧意見，甚而至於「打離婚官司，」分散了結。由此：我們可以想到，「自由戀愛不一定是美滿的。」</p>
<p>無論是怎機愛好諒解的夫妻，有時候也會反目，鬧上一陣子。關於這問題，記得三年前本報本埠新聞欄舉辦「讀者信箱」的時候，某君曾有過這樣的一個解釋；「夫妻淘裏的齟齬，和壁上時鐘的發條一樣的是必經的階段，時鐘的發條，走走要完的，必定要開上一開，然後再走，夫妻也是這樣：反一次目，就好比開一次發條。」這，眞是一個極美妙的比喻。</p>
<h3 id="c135">衣裳之顚倒 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>古人把衣裳兩字，分得淸淸楚楚，叫做：「上衣曰衣，下衣曰裳」，所以衫子，背心，褂兒，是屬於衣的方面。袴，襪，裙子，是屬於裳的方面，卽舊家婦女，也把上衣下裳，分得有條不紊，洗滌衣服，有上身桶下身桶之別，甚至晒衣裳的竹竿，晒上衣的，認定了專晒上衣，新雇了傭婦，必再三可嚀，這是上身的，這是下身的，不容稍有顚倒，一自風氣丕變，崇尙摩登，頓時把上下的界限打破，且有將已落伍的下裳，稍事變化，搬到上身來的，第一就是套褲，套褲有褲管，沒有褲襠，製裁起來，較為簡省，並且置備了綢套褲，可以掩蓋布褲的率陋，這也是前輩先生們會打算盤處。不料這種套褲，現今早已取銷，却見街頭的警察，在肘臂上加一袖筒，滑稽家說：「這是套褲的變相，形下忽然形上了，」降至近今，婦女紛紛赤了足，穿着鏤空的革鞵，姍姍過市，都市人們司空見慣，也沒有以為詫異的了。據摩登女子對在下說：「這種裸足制，無非為經濟起見。實在因為若干圓一雙的絲襪，穿不到多時，便有决踵之虞，所以不如直捷的赤裸了，人家以為赤裸了，何等的凉爽，那裏知道我們却在那兒受罪，因為襪子是吸收汗汁的，沒有襪子，汗汁在脚底滑膩膩地怪難過，尤其我們喜歡跳舞的，跳了多次，脚底動輒起泡生痛，眞是有苦說不出哩，」在下道：「旣然講到經濟，那麽省了襪，為什麽這樣熱的天氣，却要加着手套，豈非把下身的襪子移到上身來了麽？」那位摩登女子對在下嗔着杏眼道：「這明明是駡我了，但手套的代價，究比襪子價廉的多呢。」</p>
<h3 id="c136">賣花 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>在我們弄裏，每天淸早七點鐘至七點半之間，必有一位十五歲的蘇州姑娘，來叫賣鮮花的。（並非白蘭花，是供挿入花瓶用的鮮花。）伊雖然並不美麗，但嬌小玲瓏，更配略懂風情的半天眞的憨態，確也有三分够人歡喜的所在。因此，伊每天早上來時，我們公寓裏三十幾個寓客之中，至少總有三分之一，借着買一東鮮花為由，有一搭沒一搭的向伊閒話着，糾纏着。我是一個俗人，根本就不知賞鑒花朶兒的藝術，同時，也沒有向那姑娘調笑的閒情逸致，所以本來是不想買的。但是那幾個茶房，却幾乎每天都得來替那姑娘，向我兜售。有時給纏不過，便也花十幾個子兒買一束，把筆筒權當着花瓶供養着。</p>
<p>上星期，整整一星期，茶房沒來糾纒過，我很是納罕。昨天因事須一早出門，走刀樓下，忽見兩個茶房，把一個賣花的老婆子推擁着出門，老婆子却掙扎着苦苦哀求·我覺得奇怪，忙問甚麽事。老婆子說：一我的女兒，每天早上，在這裏，得賣掉半塊多錢的鮮花。這幾天伊忽病了，我來賣，這二位先生不許我進門。啊喲，先生，我們苦惱子，做不到生意，是要沒飯吃的，求你先生給方便方便。」伊說着，眼淚滾下來了。但是那兩個茶房，却又狠狠的躥出來道：「老太婆，滾開些，誰要買你這老太婆的花。」</p>

<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>在馬路上和弄堂中常能聽到噹噹地敲鐵板的聲音，可知瞎子的多。</p>
<p>瞎子誠然是可憐的，有物不能見，有事不能做。但生活的鞭子同樣的重重地敲在他們的背上，使他們不得不設法養活自己。</p>
<p>算命是瞎子最大的出路，但他們學習比較困難，須把全部的東西都記住。學成之後，有的開舖子，像西藏路林立的「直談命課」他們主要的營業不是算命，而是附帶替算命的做懺。他們伶俐的嘴能說出流年是怎樣的不好，使人們願意地拿出錢來。另一種就是用鐵板敲着的。他們常用一個人扶着。他們的收入却不十分豐裕，因為沒有額外的收入。</p>
<p>測字也是瞎子的一種職業。他們在每個字卷上挖了幾個不同的洞，只要摸出洞的數目，就知道這是什麼字。最後一種就是乞丐，他們簡直沒有自立的能力，祗能把殘廢作乞憐的工具。</p>
<p>瞎子固是可憐，憐惜他們的人也較多；所以有許多不是瞎子，却裝了瞎子謀生。在泥城橋有個瞎子測字，他雖把眼睛閉住，但眼球不住地在跳動。過了幾分鐘，他必張一張眼，才覺舒服。有一次，他張着眼在買香烟，人家對他笑，他自已也忍不住地笑了。</p>
<p>瞎子在路上走，必定有人攙着才行。所以瞎子的乞丐，多半是假的。</p>

<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>世界的耳與目：開末拉，斐膜，映片機，銀幕，聯合起來在新世紀裏雄踞了時事報吿的寳座。</p>
<p>一九二一年六月，第　屆遠東運塲會在上海虬口公園舉行，商務印書館活動影片部商得該會同意，　靑年會影片主任比德博士（D　r．peter）合作，在塲攝取新聞片，共成三卷：第一卷是健兒入塲情形和開幕禮節，第二卷是各項運動决賽，第三卷是女生會操和童軍會操。這三卷東西啟開了中國新聞影片的製作。</p>
<p>明星影片公司忝居中國影業界老大哥之位　因為牠設立較早，而且迄今健存者。您亦記得牠的處女作是那一張片子否？『孤兒救祖記』，也許您這樣回答。但是牠的第一張正片，而並非第一此的製作·「那未，滑稽大王遊滬記是吧？」不，明星公司出品不是以滑稽片起始，而是以新聞片起始的：一九二二年三月九日，法國霞飛將軍來滬觀光，他是在歐戰中以瑪納一役救了法國的危亡而成名的將軍，上海法租界當局曾於一九一五年將區內最繁盛的寳昌路改名霞飛路，以誌感激，此際霞飛訪滬，霞飛路上燈彩迎接，盛極一時；正是這時候，明屋影片公司組織成立了，就將歡迎霞飛將軍的情形攝入鏡頭裏，作為試片。這一號試片，在四月初曾假座靑年會公映，而滑稽大王遊滬　則係於同年八月十五日公映於夏令配克大戲院，孤兒救祖記於次年十二月公映於申江大戲院。</p>
<p>新聞片雖於一九二一—二二年巳有攝製，然而牠的重要性尙未被注意，所以偶有製作，却未見發達。一九二七年以後始稍盛。</p>
<p>一九三〇年，聯華影業公司成立，對於新聞片頗注意攝裂，平均每月能出版一號，名為「聯華新聞」。至一九三三年五月，共出三十號；時中央黨部宣傳委員會鑒於新聞影片傳達時事的力量偉大，特令中宣會電影股和聯華公司為新聞片之合作。先是，中宣會亦有新聞片出版，曾出至十號；目合作以後，乃協助聯華派員到各地攝取新聞，範圍擴大，材料充實，改名為「中國新聞」，下署『中央宣傳委員會聯華影業公司合製』一年中共出四十五號；以前每號祇包含一件時事，至是乃至少包含最近時事三種以上，最多時達到九種。次年五月，雙方所訂的一年合同期滿，不再繼續；十一月，中宣會電影股擴大為電影科，又改建中央電影塲。雙方仍各自進行攝製新聞片。</p>
<p>中國新聞片的裂作，無論在貿與量上，比起歐美來是相差甚遙的；但是和從前較量，却已進步石少了。祝牠努力前進吧！尤望新聞界和電影界合作，如美國的赫斯特和米高梅一樣，兩家的結晶，那眞正是「新聞影片」呵！</p>

<p>除却每晚搽抹鷄子淸，以阻止伊臉上的皺紋繼續展長或擴大之外，太后還有許多的方法，專是為着要對付那些皺紋的。有一種是非常別緻的，原來伊的梳裝檯上還安着兩根約摸二三寸長的玉棍，兩頭有金子鑲的柄，每天早上，伊必須用它門來在伊自己的臉上或上或下的滾着。這個東西是很滑而很冷的，上面也並不塗着什麽藥粉，眞不知有何作用？太后却總是很有耐性地坐在那梳裝檯前，一面不住的把它在臉上滾個不休，一面定神朝鏡子內望着，彷彿滾幾滾馬上就有功效的樣子。我瞧得很詫異，有一次凑伊不在的時候，竟大着胆取起一條玉棍來，試用了一會；不料太后恰巧就走了進來，一見很不快。可是伊的不快倒不是因為我偷用了伊老人家的東西，乃是明知我對於伊這根玉棍的功用有些懷疑，故而不高興。</p>
<p>「這東西對於你是沒有什麽用處的！」伊立卽很嚴肅地發話道：「像你們這樣年輕的人，什麽鷄子淸，珠粉，脂油等等都是用不到的！這種玉棍是格外無需了！」</p>
<p>「求太后寬恕！我忙着給伊叩頭，並謝罪道：「奴才並不敢胡亂偷用太后的東西，祗是瞧這玉棍光滑得太可愛了，想試試看，不知道滾在皮膚上是怎樣的舒服？……但下次是一定不敢了！」</p>

<p>决賽期改十九日</p>
<p>速日天雨塲濕、比賽進行、為之阻得、除丙組外、甲乙兩組、雖在積極舉行補賽、但因少數球員之躭擱、致影響同組對手比賽程序、故該會委員會昨已議定各球員准於今日（十一日）起至十六日止、六天之內結束甲乙組複賽、俾該會得定於九月十九日（星期四）下午三時再舉行甲乙丙三組决賽云、</p>

<p>表演賽原議定邱飛海君担任邀約西友任務、但邱君近來球運不佳、心緒惡劣、昨日又受挫於王文正、懊喪之餘、故延至今日、尙未與西人網球家接洽、屆時之表演賽恐難實現、致南洋盃之完美計劃、遭受打擊、亦一恨事也、又邱君自屢遭挫折、　羽而歸、壯志消慶、雄心頓泯、故與侯尙雄·錢耀彬之賽、延至今日尙未舉行、影響全局、尤為不少、</p>
<p>乙丙組冠軍預測</p>
<p>乙組李偉才、以六比三·四比六·六比四。戰勝劉增殊出人意料之外、如彼再能克服許德民於複賽中、則冠軍之希望、易如反掌、丙組陳其浩對詹文耀之複賽、日昨劇戰四盤、未分勝負、今日尙須繼賽、勝者當與王叔慶對周家騏組中之勝者决賽、以球藝論、王君似勝一籌、冠軍最有把握、但王君昨日猝丁父憂、一片雄心、亦惟有付之無可奈何耳、</p>

<p>「這是什麼呢，我的孩啦？」</p>

<p>「唐恩來了。」</p>
<p>「誰是唐恩呢？」</p>
<p>「他是我沿街彈琴時所熟識的一個男孩子。他賣報紙，待我很好，那天在鎮上看看了他，告訴他這裏怎樣的好，他現在己經來了。」</p>

<p>— 寒峯</p>
<p>曾經說過一部題做「榆關紀事」的庚子筆記，指出了在那部書裏所反映的帝國主義當時在中　的相互間的矛盾。最近又買到一部四卷的一庚　海外紀事，」初意祇打算看看庚子時期的國外情形，　意外的發現了和「榆關紀事」一樣的特色，使我們能更淸晰的看到一聯軍」在如何的暗鬥·雖然著者是德國大使呂海賣，而又不　於是一部「官書。」</p>
<p>這部書的編成，是在辛丑（一九〇）呂海寳卸任的時候，同　回到國內付印的。從事變之始，一直記釗醇親王代表淸庭到德國陪禮，他自己卸任。第一卷收他拍發給中國政府，各省官吏，和在他國的公使的電信。第二卷是各方面的來電。卷三記他每次訪問淸外相的談話。末一卷為諭旨，和約，德國的覆牒，及翻譯的外國輿論。</p>
<p>「自序」裏說那時德國的情形。「及至戕使衅成，聯軍北犯，德亦防範愈　，遂有密電之　。聞從他使處紆廻遞逹，而於中事，聲氣究多隔聞，視古蠟書雁帛，未審其難孰似。當克使　戕之信到柏林，舉國譁然，無識之民，向中國使館時出不遜之言。因嚴諭隨員翻譯等閉戶不出，以避兇鋒。」這自是在吾人意料之中的事實。證諸其所發各電，也大體如此。七月九日電云：「德使斃，德王甚怒，又派鐵艦四快船，一赴華，約二千名。矢取北京為城下盟。柏林民情洶洶勢甚危。」而六月二十三日電文，就有「近日謠傳更惡，德都官民慌急，各國協以謀我」的話，可見在克林德沒有被害的時候，各國已經在那裏互通聲氣。秣馬厲兵了。</p>
<p>最妙的是中國政府，克林德之死已經成了週知的事實，還想設法掩飾，其愚笨眞不可及。六月初五日　北洋大臣李電云：「　相電，德使在都亂匪擊斃，外無知者，密籌有無消弭之策。」這樣的大事。竟說「外無知者，」問「有無消弭之策」豈非怪事　但怪事並不止此。入後到德陪禮，德皇一定要醉親王和隨臣叩頭，經過很多時間的磋商，德皇才允許把醇親王一人免了。醇親王這時怎樣的打算呢？七月十九日電云：「惟參贊跪拜，有傷國體。茲以折中定斷，遞時只帶金楷　賡音泰等傳譯，張　蔭昌等，仍照前電，或託病，或暫避他處，以免跪拜受辱。」其可憐可笑，眞出意外。這也就　怪乎德皇最後的讓步，非「坐受國書」不可了。</p>
<p>所謂反映帝國中義相互間的矛盾何在呢？庚子八月十三日出使俄國大臣　電云：「罪魁已懲，戕使已卹，德　帥　使來津，未得　，而德兵分出靜海，俄兵分略北直　台山海關，是何陰謀？」這「是何陰謀，」正不必問，「榆關紀事」裏巳正面的指示出來，俄想打通歸路。佔領到俄的要道，德英等則恐彼佔優勢，趁俄兵出動，以海軍先佔領檢關一帶，在「庚子海外紀事」裏，也一樣的看得出來，瓦德西的死，應該是德國的一件　事，而從德外長和呂使的屢次談話裏，似乎倒不是重心。重心者何？實是德以外各國在中國的行動。中國給了他們特殊的好處沒有？和別國訂了密約給予了特殊的商　利益沒有？如辛丑一月三日電：「外部函約往晤，壚稱和議未結以前，中國最好不與他們及公司定約，將土地銀錢等利益相讓。」四日電云：「揣德意恐各國乘機奪利。彼現為聯軍領袖，不能不思沾利益，又不肯遭育。」而三月十一電史是玄妙：</p>
<p>昨外部密稱：聯軍撤否，以償欵為斷。聞鄒督為償欵甚着急。如有實在辦法，不妨密吿。事苟可行，德必格外遷就，並助華力勸各國照允，可否將此意轉電等語。已密電香帥矣。問其用意所在，又密言聞為償欵事，有從中漁利者，恐華官為其所惑，故德願知中國本意所在云。仍乞秘密以免外洩。</p>
<p>這里面眞表示了所謂「司馬昭之心，」好個「德必格外運就！」書屎還記着德外部的許多問話，與某國訂約的消息可實，給與了其國其種利益事有無？時時指摘各國都不懷好心，「祇有德國是算能帮助中國的。」這種甜言蜜語，當時身受者不知作若何感想，實則天下烏鴉一樣黑，愈張其彼此間之矛盾實况而已。於電文中，於談話中，都時時露出，不多列舉矣。對於國內的情形，說得很少，主要的是說出使大臣與德交涉的經過。書後附譯各文，有對中國表示好感者，亦有加以攻擊的，但總沒有「莊諧選錄』所摘譯的幾條，能以見到一點『正義。』故捨此而別錄『選錄』七的話：</p>
<p>法國帶兵官某曰：「義和團之用意極是。凡外國教士之欲至中國傳教老，中國人極應騙之去。吾若為中國人，亦欲為中國人所為。若中國欲傳教於吾法，吾亦欲驅之出法境。」〇總國某報記義和團曰：「吾輩以中國為已死盡，今乃有此，是尙未死盡也！」〇日本大隈伯曰：「汝輩勿詬病義和團，吾輩前三十年所為，亦義和團也。」〇有德國兵回國者，甚道義和團之奇曰：「十餘歲小兒，咸能持刀向前，略不畏死。基至前列巳死而　繼進，眞勇不可及。」又曰：「德兵嘗戰某處，見兵已倒，遂驅而前，倒地者忽起，被格殺數十人。」〇又有德兵自華調回國者，道出畏崎，北帶兵官至某洋行，闔門吿人曰：「華兵號為無用，實則不然，其驍悍處，實為西兵所不及。余在天津，與華兵戰，有一華兵，已受七傷，猶力戰而前。最後，中其足，乃倒。以為已死。我兵驅過其側，不意兵忽起，極力　我兵之足。我兵顧其面目，血肉糢糊，怖極，幾與俱斃。後以槍尖之刀刺之，復倒，我兵乃得脫。』</p>
<p>這些意見是眞可實，可惜知者極鮮，今幸得遇之，使我們得以窺見義和團之英勇，與一般記載傳言，實是逈異。「莊諧選錄」又有論「拳匪」云。「殊不知拳匪之事雖不可為訓，然其用意，則頗為歐人所驚。蓋以數十年來，歐人陵侮我國人，雖旁觀者猶不能堪。而中國之大臣，未有毀身家以當國難者，其小臣未嘗有合羣力以爭國是者，其時士人咸沉埋於私利之中。今忽有人焉，以懷忿怒之故，挺身而起，不畏死，不避難。以為中國尙有生人氣，或且以為中國或於是復振，吾國凡稍有生氣之人皆不可不知。」是極有見地者，不知為伊誰之言也。然亦由此可見，　義和團事件作公正論，是並不待於今日矣。因談「庚子海外紀事，」特附及之。</p>

<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>今天早晨的確有點凉的秋意了，雖然尙未木葉盡脫，然而早秋的道種凉意，早已够人難受的了。我在枕上的時候，便聽着窗前的風有點兩樣，我無聊的吟着「秋風起兮白雲飛，草木黃兮雁南歸，」心裏便覺得有點凄凉的抵觸，及至起床之後，把窗帘打起，　陽仍是那樣使人可畏，我的凄凉的情不由得又消逝了。晚嚮在花園的門前經過，白楊樹的葉子颯颯的一響，忽然想起古詩上的「白楊何蕭蕭」的句子來，抬起頭來看看，葉子還是很密的，濃綠得怕人，因為天色暮了的緣故吧，所以樹的葉子完全黑成一團了。我又覺得有難受，低下頭去不敢看它了。</p>
<p>我平時低下頭來走路，總是默默的想，所以有時竟走到人身上去，事後同人家道了歉，自己覺得可笑。這種沉思的毛病太不好了，我自己知道；但有什麼法子教它不想呢？腦筋不能由我的支配，再說我儘有許多的回憶呢？比如說道楊樹的葉子一響，我想起一椿事來，兩年之前我會同一位女士坐在樹底下，現在我們巳經結了婚，而且有了孩子了；當時計劃着我們未來的幸福，前途的光明，可是現在呢？一切都消逝了，一切都是平庸，我不知道我走的路應當是怎樣的。我只感覺人在這世界上就是「混」！古人說「浮生若夢，」說「光陽駒隙」，說「祖歲文如許，吾生眞若浮，」我們要再嘆息光陰過的太快，似乎有點頻，然而從前同我玩皮球的小孩子現在已經結了婚，我們有什麼法子不教息光陰之過去的太迅速呢？</p>
<p>再抬起頭來看看，月芽兒已掛在亭子犄角上了，用不了幾犬又是一輪滿月，又用不了幾天又是月芽兒了，這樣的輪迥，眞不轉到何年何月才算完。現在眼看着又到中秋了，想一想以前的中秋是怎樣過去的，還很淸楚。一個中秋是同着母親在院中祭月亮，彷彿不知道月亮裏有什麼神秘的東西，母親說月亮裏有松樹，有神仙，我拾起頭來凝視了一陣，一個很光明的球在一碧如水的睛空上奔馳着，果然像有一棵松樹占滿了大半個球，我感覺莫名其妙的愉快。又一個中秋的印象更深，道是我踏上人生荊棘之途的第一日，一個人提着小皮箱，踏上輪船的甲板，天上在落雨，甲板上滑滑的，上了船一低頭便鑽到艙裏去了，我忘了今天還是中秋。不想到夜半醒了，水手們正在又麻雀，劈拍的聲音不知教人多麼厭煩。於是我冉到甲板上去看看，雨已停了，月亮正在海的大中，海水是銀蛇撩動，盪動得天上的月也像是搖搖不定。畫家畫不出這　像來，我更寫不出這景像來，這是宇宙偉大的　觀。我忘了我這是在那裏，我忘了我這次離家是為什麼事，史不知道原來這天正是中秋。如果我要想起這天是中秋，你想，「每逢佳節倍思親」，人宗在家裏吃月餅，我　作了漂泊的遊子，更不知要涕泗何從了，幸而我當時沒有想起這天是中秋。又一個中秋是在靑島，又一個中秋在瀋陽，一年一年都是很淸楚的，現在　然月色猶昔，只是人事已非了，再要過從前的中秋，是再也不能的了。</p>
<p>月亮漸漸的升起，我已轉入一條小　裏了，陡然由繁華熱鬧的馬路走上黑暗的小巷中，覺得異常的凄凉　寞，回頭聽見馬路上汽車喇叭那樣激厲的聲音，真是恍如隔世，彷彿一塲夢才醒，神經也有點迷離不淸。前天讀的放翁詩不知為什麼也湧入腦中：「近坊燈火如書明，十里東風吹市聲，遠坊寂寂門　閉，只有烟月無人行，……歸來空齋臥凄冷，燈前病骨峻巉影，……」</p>
<p>到家之後，妻向我為什麼神色這樣沮喪，我說沒有什麼，大槪　體有點不舒適。妻沒有說什麼。晚飯也沒有吃，我便躺在床上睡熟了。</p>

<p>小毛頭又笑又跳］小和尙更加得意。他按住這頭板：「慢慢爬！」等妹妹坐好了，自己也就騎上去。</p>
<p>「怎麼才蹺呢？」一小和尙在想主意。</p>
<p>小毛頭看不動，，着身子呌：「動廠丫！」</p>
<p>嘿，這下可弄動了。妹妹一上，他一下，幌得又害怕，又好玩。兩人張開嘴扳緊床板在輕輕地動，他們也就輕輕地一上一下。</p>
<p>「哈！好玩啦！」小手頭想拍手，又怕跌倒了，便抓緊了床板只顧笑。</p>
<p>「高！　高！」小和尙想起人家蹺得還要高得多。</p>
<p>小毛頭可不曉得怎樣才得高。小和尙想了半天，　吿訴她：「你用勁！」</p>
<p>一點不錯，一用勁，可就蹺得高。小和尙　樂了。也就更加用了勁。小毛頭有點怕，「哥哥，慢點！」</p>
<p>誰曉得那板有點不聽話，慢不下來。小毛頭慌　呌了；她一呌，小和尙也魷慌了。床板朝小和尙這頭一竄，小毛頭便朝下一栽，向小和尙身上撰倒，那知偏偏巧巧一頭就撞在後面鍋腔子的鐵鍋邊邊，當時鮮血直流，「哇啦二聲，小毛頭哭了。</p>
<p>跌倒在地下的小和尙，床板壓了自己的腿，從妹妹身底下爬出來，可再也站不起來了。一眼看見妹妹頭上的血，淌得像小河一樣，魂都嚇掉了。一　按住那傷口，司是他的腿也不得動了。血還是那樣流。</p>
<p>小毛頭呌着：「媽……」聲音可越呌越低。</p>
<p>小和尙也呌着：「媽！……」聲音越呌越慘。</p>
<p>聲音怪難聽的，可是媽媽還沒有回來。（完）</p>

<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>說到花旗蜜橘，我是和牠有緣的。</p>
<p>却說一九三安七月六日，內子靜宜因腸病突然轉劇，急投紅十會總醫院我紀庚醫師開刀，九死一生，幸而住院一個月，勉强救了一條命出來。那個時候，我的頂小的一個男孩申兒，剛剛生出來八個月，還沒有斷奶。母親進了醫院，留下這個吃奶的孩子，怎麼辦呢？僱來奶媽，他望了一望，有奶不吃。調了奶粉，盛在奶瓶裏，他吮了一口，不肯冉吮。倒是米湯調糖，他可以喝一小碗。喝了幾天，他又不喝了。米湯裏攙下一點鷄湯或魚肉的湯，頗有鹹味，他頂歡喜去喝。只有夜裏沒有東西給他吃，他幾乎要哭一個整夜。有一夜，我買了一個花旗橘子，剖開一瓣瓣送到他口裏，他高興極了，把橘瓣當做奶子去吮，一　可以吃兩三瓣。他哭的時候就給他橘子吃，這一夜要算他舒舒服服地過去。從此我就給他每夜吃橘子當奶吃了，一個月他吃八九塊錢的花旗橘子，還是差不多花了僱奶媽的錢。因此他就做了美國寗橘的一個小小的消耗者，我也有吃道種橘子的嗜好了。</p>
<p>—多年以前，我淸瘦已極，偶感風寒便要啄嗽，頗有肺病嫌疑。俗說一橘子兜痰」，雖有佳橘，未敢多吃。其實，俗說毫無根據。倘據舊醫書說，陳皮橘絡都是消食化痰的東西。相傳廣東化　衙門內有橘樹一株，橘皮煮湯吃了，司以立刻化痰止嗽。至今化橘皮在國藥中還是認作化痰止咳的一種特效藥。還有一個使我不敢吃橘的原因，我患了十多年的胃病，西醫說是胃酸過多症，凡是酸性的東西，我都不敢多吃。有些西醫說是「食橘過多者每患酸性病，以致人身之組織俱呈酸性反應，欲醫此病，非禁食橘汁不可。」內　靜宜患患患的胃病，已忌吃酸的東西，她於橘子絕對不敢嘗。後來有個西醫勸我們試吃橘子，說是如果吃子橘子以後，腸胃病不加利害，那就最好多吃橘子。據說：「橘酸是有機酸，一進腸內，就被分解，失了牠的酸性，倒呈　性反應。橘汁含鑛質很多，如鈣，燐，鐵，鉀，鈉，氯，硫等，尤以鉀為最多，更能增强鹼性，所以吃橘雖多，决不致息酸性。冉，橘含生活紫丙很多，橘中糖質易於消化。橘　維質又有刺戟大便的功用，實為可貴。所以橘宜多吃。一我吃了橘子以後，胃病不生變化，就勸內子同吃。內子起頭遲疑，，不敢輕試。只因有一次她想吃了，就吃花旗橘子半個，覺得腸胃　滿舒服。以後她飯罷不吃橘子，倒覺得不舒服起來。所以橘子成立我們一家的日常果食，佔日常消耗上的一大宗。可是為了療翁病息，也就顧不到許多了。</p>
<p>據湖南民問的傳說，郴州地方有一個井，四圍都是橘樹，所以呌橘井。井旁住了一個姓蘇的道人和他的老母親。有一大，蘇道人對老母親說道：「媽媽，我要成仙去了。我看明年天下一定要遭瘟疫。只有我們這里的井水升，橘業一枚，煎得吃了，可以醫治。」蘇道人說完這話，就飛昇而去。到了來年，果然發牛瘟疫，十　九死。只有蘇家老媽媽吩咐吃過井水橘葉湯的，病都好了。至今湖南許多藥舖還掛上「橘井流泉，或「橘井生春」的市招匾額。湖南人談到橘子，還有不致忘記這一個故事的。</p>
<p>如今又是秋天了。秋盡冬初，紅橘入市。但不知嶽麓山下，我的舊寓橘園，依舊結實纍纍，靑黃　爛否？唉，那是十多年前的事了！</p>

<h3 id="c190">奇裝異服有傷風化嗎？ <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>中國南北二地的風氣，好像會互相傳染似的。廣州取締男女同泳不久，北平就跟着效法起來。北平一禁止男女合校，廣州也有照樣辦理之傳。及至最近兩地又不約而同在實行取締奇裝異服了。</p>
<p>北平：七月三十日晚，哈爾飛戲院，有身佩盒子砲，手持小手槍之警察書十名，蜂擁而至，下令凡衣薄如蟬翼，裸腿不穿襪之摩登婦女，一律出院，不准聽戲，俟換衣後再來，同時門外亦有警士把守，凡婦女之奇裝異服者，一概擋駕，毫不通融，一般摩登婦女，祗得垂頭喪氣，各自返家，一幕趣劇，於以告終。</p>
<p>廣州：日前省會公安局，頒布一服裝標準，勸婦女界一律遵守，並責令洋服店，以後勿再裁製新式衣服，及派女宣傳隊，到各公共場所演講，詎行之十餘日，而市上穿着奇裝異服，招搖過市者，仍到處皆是，公安局認為非強制執行，不能收效，故定九月一日起嚴厲取締，有遠抗者，即帶局究辦。</p>
<p>近來我國因為開心風化者之多，於是一班婦女，便非常倒霉。所謂奇裝異服，在我們的目光看來，不過是式樣比較新奇而已，原值不得大驚小怪。若為提倡儉樸，來一個糾正，還有幾分理由可說。但一部份人，卻每指此為有傷風化，非嚴行禁止，終無以挽回世道人心。此種見解，未免過於迂腐。我們委實不相信一件新奇服裝，會引起傷風敗體之事。她們西洋婦女，十九皆是裸腿祖胸的，我們就未曾見過她們因此而傷及風化。難道中國人各個盡是急色兒，一看到女子某一段肉體，便會生起邪念。此真是中國人的恥辱。退一步說，奇裝異服算它是妖冶吧，要取締，也祗能出之以勸導。用手槍威嚇，似乎是不必的，強制執行，亦非妥善的辦法。</p>
<p>我們還記得去年三月間，杭州曾發生過一椿所謂摩登破壞事件。一般無賴之徒，到處用鏹水損毀婦女的衣服。此種野蠻行動，旋即遭當局禁止。但是行政院長汪精衛氏，特為此發表言論，解釋摩登的意義，謂摩登即是現代。可見摩登並不是罪惡，我們又何必深惡痛絕之。其實傷害風化的事，社會上多得很，要取締，恐怕也取締不了。若奇裝異服，於風化究無多大關係。當局必—用全力以赴之，實見其徒勞而已。</p>
<h3 id="c191">余善福 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 史維之</p>
<p>人物塑像之二</p>
<p>余善福，他是我的師兄，——我托父親的餘蔭—有着這麼一個師兄。</p>
<p>他的腳有些破，所以他的名字倒沒有他先天帶來的病來得出名，一般人都「拐腳」「拐腳」的叫，至多，有人知道他的名字叫善福，因之叫他「善福拐腳」，至於他姓什麽，那祗為很少的人　知道。</p>
<p>他為人是滿好的，誠懇，熱心，碰到有什麽事情他情願把工作擱在一旁替人家奔走，為了愛管閒事，給人辭掉生意是時常有的事，但是失業之後，他並不怨誰，他一定得把那件事情幹完了，　再設法去尋工作做。</p>
<p>爲了這緣，他時常會給別個自以為聰明的師兄在背後批評，「皇帝不急，急煞太監，」沒頭蒼蠅樣的亂竄亂奔，看有什麽好處呢。</p>
<p>但時當那些自以為聰明的師兄們有什麽事情發生了，便會找善福去。</p>
<p>善福師兄雖然以前也曾風聞過這缺點，不過祗要有人找到他，並且懇求他幫忙，他又會怪起勁的去跑。</p>
<p>他說，師兄弟淘不幫忙，難道叫外頭人來幫忙嗎？雖然他明知道幫忙的結果於他是毫無益處的，有時候還「把人家的棺材抬到自己的家裏來，」（註）不過他依舊還是不顧一切的去奔走。</p>
<p>有時候把人家的事情管閒事管制自己身上來了，結果還是給原當事人在背後偷偷地說，「都是「拐腳」，事情本來老早可以了的，偏偏他梗在當中，現在還是沒一個了結。」</p>
<p>他聽了自然一肚子的不高興，把事情了結之後，便自己向自己發誓：以後</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>孫子亡八蛋再管閒賬，寃家都是我結的，出了力還要給人過橋拔橋，難道我清清凈凈的人不會做嗎？</p>
<p>但是過了些時候又有人去找他的時候，他又把自己起過的誓忘了。</p>
<p>他的工作的技能不很高明，又愛管閒事，往往進了店沒幾天，因爲給人找了去「幫忙，」於是把未了的工作一擱便擱個十天八天，因之，上海的同行聽到有人說起善福拐脚來，便都搖頭，甚至，還會有人向來人說，拐脚嗎，手頭有不高明，又愛管事，我們的店小，實在沒有這麼胃口。</p>
<p>這着，一年間，他總有半年是在我們店裏工作着的。</p>
<p>在我們店裏工作，在他也是無可奈何的事情，因爲師兄弟們都瞧他不起，時常冷言冷語的來拿他開玩笑，而且他看見父親有些怕。</p>
<p>爲了受不慣約束，而他又是做慣了野馬的，所以等過了些時候，他的野心又按擦不住了，便：</p>
<p>「師父，我想到外碼頭去找找事情看，聽說近來××的市面很好呢。」</p>
<p>每次，父親總是笑笑，不加可否的：「做人總得安穩點，年紀也過了三十了，還是像十七八歲一樣的歡喜管閒事，外碼頭人生路不熟的，更加要安穩一點。」</p>
<p>等父親走後，便自言自語似地：「師父還是那一套老話，當我三歲看，」加過頭來，便高興地向着我，「阿弟，到了××我寫信給你。」</p>
<p>當晚，他的行踪便沒有知道，等第二天下午，把工具車了去。</p>
<p>這樣，是成了老例了，鄰居們看到他來車工具，便開玩笑似地：「拐脚，又要開碼頭了嗎？」</p>
<p>母新死後三天，他不知從那裏得來的消息，買了些紙錠，香燭趕了來，在母親靈前磕了頭，第一句話便問：</p>
<p>「師母的靈柩放在那裏？」</p>
<p>告訴了　靈柩在，　　我寫了個字條揣在懷裏，說是雖然來遲了一步，見不到師母的最後一面，但是靈柩終得去見見的，也好安安心。</p>
<p>自那次見面以後，整三年沒會面了，前幾天在路上碰到他，他已改了行，在買蟀蟋過活。臨分別：「阿弟，你近來還養蟋蟀嗎？這裏有一隻很好的，你拿回去玩玩，好在這裏的孩子們都是不識貨的。」</p>
<p>等我回答他說蟋蟀已多年不養了的時候，他笑笑說，「我倒忘了呢，你現在也是一個大人了。」</p>
<p>（註：把「人家的棺材抬到自己的家裏來。」那意思是說，把人家的事兒擱到自己的身上來。）</p>

<p>是雪後濃陰的日子。</p>
<p>前門外有許多閒人們在擁擠着，各人的臉色是興奮的，喘息使他們的呼吸像到站的火車一樣，鼻子　　出一股股的熱氣。</p>
<p>「上天橋看斃人去呀！」</p>
<p>小孩子們高聲喊着。馬路兩帝站着觀望的人都翹起足後跟，慌張地望着後面黑鑽鑽的人羣。</p>
<p>「來了！來！」各種高低不齊的聲音一齊由觀衆們的口裏不自覺地流出來。像名旦出塲一般，千萬支眼睛的箭一齊射在後面的汽車上。</p>
<p>壓道的警車隊緩緩地駛過了。騎在馬上的警察掄着木棍驅走街心的行人。「走開！喂，走開呀！」騎在馬上的人嚴肅地喊。這是他們最得意的時候。</p>
<p>隨後駛着來的是三輛寬敞的載重貨車。車上站着一個犯人。這時候四方八面就揚起了一陣采聲。</p>
<p>站在車上犯人輕鬆地角開衣扣，衣角在北風中飄動着。他是一個壯健的漢子，面色黧黑，炯炯眼睛掃射着站在步道上的行羣。</p>
<p>「唱一唱曲吧！」有誰向犯人要求了</p>
<p>漢子面上浮着笑。隨後就拉直嗓子唱出武生的調子來：</p>
<p>「俺好漢……當年……」那聲音在北風裏顯得格外悲壯。</p>
<p>「好！好！」馬路像座舞台，彩聲像陣急雨。</p>
<p>在一家酒店門口，汽車停了：</p>
<p>「喂，掌櫃的，老子要一斤白乾！」</p>
<p>「眞是個好漢子！」提着鳥籠的老旗人失聲讚嘆了。</p>
<p>「可不是！前幾天斃了二個抽白面的垂頭喪氣，叫人看了不起勁。」旁過一個年青的夥計模樣的人說。</p>
<p>等到人聲跟着那漢子一齊遠了之後，馬路上的殘雪都化成水了，剩下的是一街泥濘的路。</p>
<p>（二）垃圾堆</p>
<p>你見過垃圾堆麼？這是北平市容難得的點綴呢。</p>
<p>在稍爲僻靜的胡同的盡頭，甚至在幾個大學的門口都有着這樣的垃圾堆。在它的旁過，時常有一泓銅青色的積水，蚊蟲在其中幽閒地浮游着。</p>
<p>每天由清早一直到黃錯，就有着一些穿紅號衣的清道夫們緩緩地推着土車，把垃圾倒在這兒，發霉的青菜，腐爛了的腸胃，跳着蚤，鑽動着蛆虫的死貓，死雞同死鼠等等就積成一座小山，六月裏的陽光蒸着他，西北風載着它，隣右同行人就都沾了這實惠了。</p>
<p>然而亦有許多人是靠着這垃圾堆過活的。</p>
<p>同樣亦是由天亮一直到黃錯，小孩子們，老太太們，小姑娘們亦跟蛆虫一樣在這垃圾堆上蠕動着。他們手腕裏大都帶着一個破籃，檢着煤球，紙屑，破布，罐頭聽子，碎玻璃瓶等等，他們用手，用小竹鞭，聚精會神地翻着，揀着，搶着。頭髪已失去了黑艷的顏色，油膩把它沾成一團了。小孩們頭上身上長滿着瘡，疴了屎，拉了鼻涕就拉了他那襤褸的衫子亂揩。而烏鴉同猪狗亦是他們常見的友人。</p>
<p>這些是靠着人家扔掉倒掉的東西過活的呵！尤其是小孩子們，他把受凍，他們挨餓，他們沒有健康。</p>

<p>— 秦鍳</p>
<p>不知從什麼時候起，他不知爲了什麼緣故，我終於隱隱地感到了秋天的存在了。</p>
<p>日間是把整個的身體與靈魂交給了生活的支配的，而一到晚上，白天的　擾已經完全消失，人們從酣睡中透出不均渾的吐息，從惡夢漏出絲絲的嗚咽與狂呼，彷彿極願永遠再記不起人世間的諸式的憂患，或，就是最低限度，也企圖能在自己的夢中偷偷地吐出許多生活上的委屈似的－這之間，是包藏着不少的憤恨與恥辱的：他們被抑在生活的重量中，日夜地。</p>
<p>縱然那樣：可是世界是依然靜寂的。夜是多麼的沈著與幽靜啊：人醒在這空洞的深夜裏，一種可怕的寂寞與空虛，像夏夜的大雨與閃電那樣的一次一次地襲來：我覺得每一日夜之呼吸，我也仿彿按到每一次夜之脈搏，那些，全有着多麼沈重而陰慘的姿態呢？怕而憂愁，因爲我確切地明白，眞實地感到：夜是一寸一寸地在沈落下去：一刻比一刻深了。那種深度：鳥黑而沒有盡頭，想起來是會令人窒悶的！</p>
<p>担憂地望一望窗外的大路與天空：大路是昏暗得辨不出方向來的；而天空則依然是一片荒蕪的鳥黑，從那裏，星星一顆地閃霎而熄滅掉，人不不能找出一點黎明的消息來呢。</p>
<p>感到異常的窒息，感到夜的綿茫，黎明的消息旣不能被預示到，而那夜的終止期又難以預期的，摸索着讓靈魂落在無底的阱陷裏，一刻一刻地沈落下去，那可不是舒服的事啊。</p>
<p>（秋天，而且秋天是已經長成了－秋天的午夜是難受的：一點孤寂的燈光，一串斷續的虫與風的鳴咽。火車從遠處滿載着風塵的臉孔行過，有氣無力的鳴鳴地發洩一兩聲－我，一聽到這，就能想到它蠕蠕地爬過原野的神情了－它是曾經載過多少人，與怎樣辛勞地行過多少路程過來的，誰也不知道去問訊的：而今，它是疲勞得悲憤地叫喚起來了。）</p>
<p>於是，自家兒的青青的所紀的生活的羅漫斯－那些苦難，侮辱與嘈弄－便像未曉天的輕夢那樣地，輕悄悄地落到記憶的荒地上來了，由模糊而清楚，像電影中的「溶和」似的。</p>
<p>於是便那麼想：珍惜自己罷，追取自己罷，把過去了的日子的自己再溫習一遍吧。</p>
<p>可是，終於又懷疑了：自己是什麼？過去是什麼？過去了的自己又該是什麼呢？</p>
<p>愈弄愈昏迷了，心頭的思緒被某些東西攪成一片：我竟開始懷疑世界，懷疑人類，甚至懷疑整個的生活了！</p>
<p>不是有人說過，懷疑與思辯是每個從年青到年老的人所必患的自動免疫性的「人生病」嗎?如果這是對的，那末，這黑暗與苦悶的心情，將延長到多久，而什麼時候自己底心，才會像秋夜的天空那像地，熙微地透出曙光來呢？</p>
<p>我怕，我着慌，終於，我希望了－但願這青年的對世界之信仰的解散與崩潰，祇不過是在長夜未明前的一種惡夢，到天一亮，它就會無形地消散了。</p>
<p>縱然，目前信舊是未明的黑夜－有無窮盡的荒寂與悠長。</p>

<h3 id="c205">甘勃爾駛車驚人紀錄每小時速率三百英里 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>平均每英里十一秒九五五　「藍鳥」打破以前四個紀錄</p>
<p>號稱為英國速度大王的馬爾康甘勃爾爵士。最近九月三日又在美國猶他州鹽湖城相近的薩爾杜羅湖床。舉行汽車速度賽。結果他不但打破了他上次的最高紀錄。並且已達到了他生平唯一願望的每小時三百英里的速率。這不但是甘勃爾爵士個人的成功。確也是汽車速度史上一件值得紀念的大事情。這次速率紀錄的正式數字為每小時三〇一·一二九二英里。一九三四年的紀錄為每小時二七六。八一六英里。</p>
<p>「藍烏」是甘勃爾爵士所駕的汽車名稱。以前四次的紀錄也是「藍鳥」所創立的。不過自從一九三一年以來到一九三五年止。這車每次創立新紀錄後。都經過一度的改良革新。機方也逐漸的增大。到現在這「藍鳥」兩字。也和甘勃爾的紀錄。共垂不朽了。</p>
<p>九月三日晨甘勃爾爵土在薩爾杜羅湖床駛車時。由美國汽車會派員在塲。紀錄速度時間。最初記時員所佈的速度為每小時二九九·八七四英里。比了甘氏所冀希的紀錄尙差一籌。不過為數是甚微細的。後來經美國汽車會的計時員發覺。在計時的辰光。其中略有差誤。實際上甘勃爾已經超過三百英里的紀錄。因之該會當日公佈先前二九九·八七四的紀綠為有誤。訂正每小時三一〇·一二九二英里，不過在公佈里數沒有正式披露之前。美國報紙上有載為每小時三〇·三七七英里的。不久都經改正。</p>
<p>這次賽跑的途程中。曾經發生過危險。要不是甘勃爾的鐵腕鋼心。精於駕駛。沒有不會不出大亂子的。甘氏在這樣的危險中。竟得安然渡過。眞可替他慶幸的。他將要到終點時。車已進入限度里程中。向西南方向前進。突然間那輛龐大汽車的前輪胎忽然爆裂了。這時候「藍鳥」的速度為每小時二百八十英里。我們閉着眼睛想想看。它的危險如何。要是車輪稍為歪斜一些。逸出跑道。甘勃爾沒有不粉身骨碎的了。幸虧他寸心不亂。異常鎭定。把定了他的渡盤。依着跑道前進着。終將難關渡過。</p>
<p>甘勃爾創立三百英里紀錄的時候。是在跑進了限度里程之時。那時侯車向東北方向進行。其時間為十一秒又八三。合算他車行的速度為每小時三〇四·三一一英里。這個數字打破了美國飛機速度紀錄的零頭。那個紀錄是每小時三〇四·九八英里。係已故的惠特爾氏在一九三三年九月四日。於伊利諾的格蘭佛游地方所創的。甘勃爾爵士後又以一英里十二秒又〇八的時間·向西南方向前進。其速度合算為二九八·〇一三。這兩個紀錄給他在限度里程中的平均時間為十一秒又九五五。獲得每小時三〇一·一二九二的紀錄。</p>
<p>駛車的那一天。環境很好。地面和視綫都很不壞。不過稍有風吹、是為美中不足。那風對於「藍鳥」的前進速度。每小時减低約九英里。自從甘氏獲得三百英里的紀錄披露之後。各地道賀的電訊。紛紛送來。較着的像英政府運輸部大臣李思廉好勃立歇。不列顛油業鉅子和運動名人惠克斐勛爵等。對於甘氏的創此每小時三百英里紀錄。視為一種極大光榮。在汽車駕駛和運動上都是難　可貴的。</p>
<p>一九三四年的紀錄（每小時二七六·八一六英里）創之地方係在台托那海濱。當時甘勃爾曾表示。他願望中所渴須逹到的卽為每小時三百英里。並有達到此紀錄之日。卽為彼不再駛車之時。因為這種駛車實在是件非常危險的事情。這次甘氏可謂如願以償了。當日賽車終了後。甘氏卽稱須經紐約。候船於九月九日返英。甘氏此次返英後。從此恐作冒險的將不再駛車了。甘氏的勇毅過人。眞是值得吾們佩服的。</p>
<p>甘勃爾爵士這次所駕駛的五噸「藍鳥一。樣子非當偉大。頭部平削破風。全體作低長方平形。前部雨輸為單輪。後車輪為雙輪。機力走勢都較上次在台托那時增進平穩。以一英里的途程。這「藍烏」走起來不足十二秒鐘。這車的構製眞足以雄視世上一切的車輛了。</p>
<p>在最近的三十二年中。陸上汽車的速率。從最初的每小時六十八英里。到現在甘勃爾的每下搜是三百英里。前後相較。差不多增加了五倍。最近五年間甘氏所創的紀錄如下。一九三一年平均速度每小時二〇六英里。一九三二年二四五·七三三英里。一九三三年二五三·九六八英里。一九三四年三三年二五三·六英里。一九三五年二九九·八七四英里。</p>
<h3 id="c206">汽車機構與禁聲運動的檢討 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>在最近的一二年來。歐西各國的交通當局。對於禁聲問題。非常注意。熟鬧的都市之中。十九是塵囂菲常。使人厭惡。因此。各國當局。便主張禁聲。在禁聲運動聲中。這裏值得提出的一點。便是一輛汽車。行駛在街頭上面。也隨時能發出使人厭惡的聲息。而我們為實行禁聲運動起見。應當採取那一種方法來减少汽車行駛的聲音。倫敦交通處長貝萊希氏。當他接任之初。就委任專家若干。來研究車輛行駛在街市之上。發出種種聲音的原因。並設法使其消滅或减低。這個委員會由亨利福勒任主席。經過幾個月的研究。便確定利用科學的方法來製造汽車。可以戒少一部分行車的聲饗。汽車工廠如果能够依照他們所定的原則來製造汽車。那麼這種汽車。一年之中。不拘任何季節。都可行駛街市。而並無惱人的聲息的。交通處長假如依照了他們所定的原則。那麼新車註冊的時侯。便要增加甚多規例。以限制汽車的聲響。第一內燃發火的引擎。一定要裝配有效的滅聲器。而駕駛汽車的人。更須不使其發生爆裂的聲音。我們回想起來。一九三三年度。倫敦市內。司機人因為使汽車發出不當的聲饗而拘罰者。達八千人以上。那時這種規例。本來早已列入。不過所謂有效的滅聲器。有效到怎樣一種程度。註册的時侯。當局是不注意的。無非是理論而已。從今以後二關於這點。已决定由理論而使其成為事實。要規定滅聲器的效果如何。同時，另一面更在盼望一般汽車工廠。能够合作。使所製的汽車。都能到逹一種標準以上的靜寂無聲。</p>
<p>倫敦的當局。曾經劃出過一塊靜聲區域。以作嘗試。結果已證實聲音一少。汽車的肇禍案件。亦可因以减少。不過除了汽車在機件方面。在司機人方面。可使其减少聲息之外。電車的聲饗。還是不能消滅。而非常的討厭。因此倫敦的交通當局現在已决定採用另一種沒有聲息的電力車。以替代舊有電車。這種電力車。試用的結果。已有相當的成效。所以當局已决定在未來的一年之中。倫敦市內。可使四十哩電車路線。代以無聲的電力車。這個計劃。如能實現滅。不但要看司機人和汽車製造工程是否合於科學原理所定的基準。同時還要看人們的舉動和行為。是否有道德的信條。關於這電又是計者和車廠方面無法統制的問題。駕駛汽車的人。速學。聲響。隨時能够小心謹慎。能够注意公德。那麽所謂禁聲問題。關於汽車的一部分。便不難解决了。</p>
<p>事實早已證明了。汽車的機件。聲響愈是擾人。肇禍愈是容易。一個鹵莽或技術平常的司機人。駑駛一輛汽車。爆裂的聲音，一定很厲害。而肇禍的案件。也比別個司機人為多。所以英國方面。交通當局已决定要求都市方面。車馬來往。能够維持一個相當的靜聲基準。現在的汽車。比較從前的鐵輸馬車。無疑。已减低不少聲息。但我們還是應，當進一步。使汽車的聲響。减至最小限度。以冀能够减低汽車的肇禍紀錄。一輛機車。為了地位的狹小。裝置滅聲器非常困難。但在汽車之中。却是容易的。眼前汽車的各部機件。排汽方面。應得减少音響。是一個急切而重要的問題。因為這種聲響。最是聒耳。車廠方面。近年以來。對於排汽一項。正力使其爆裂之音，减至最低限度。他們已知道良好的汽車。一定要有良好而靜聲的排汽。這個時代。人們對於煩囂的聲響。的確十九已有厭惡之心。而要使禁聲運動的現實。須由交通當局和汽車工廠合作。更是一件不可否認的事情。</p>
<h3 id="c207">希特勒扶助下之德國汽車事業 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>柏林最近汽車恊會之報吿云。德國之汽車事業現在數量方面為歐洲第二。而在出品在科學上之檢查。則為歐洲第一。不久將與遠隔大西洋之美國互相爭榮云云。德國之汽車事業在最近歡年來確有一日千里之進步。殆非一般人之宣傳言詞也。</p>
<p>德國汽車業之所以能如是進步者。殆為德國元首希特勒之扶助汽車業之故。此亦為公認者也。前月柏林之汽車展覽會開慕時。德國科學家皆集會於一堂。希特勒氏曾登臺演說德政府之悉心發展汽車工業。並述一故事。可見德國重視汽車業之一般。希特勒之故事甚可令人感有意味。全詞如下。</p>
<p>「數十年之前。印度有一英籍居民。精愈日用品之經濟計劃者也、斯人又善於管理汽車。斯時渠有精美之汽車二輛。而於駕駛之時。每感於印度道路之建築窳敗·損傷汽車甚據。因之呈請印度政府謂善事道路之建築。然斯時印度之執政者處事　預。認道路窳敗。則刻不必駛行汽車。視若無覩。斯人遂繼續申請改建道路。然終未得一回覆。此人怒極。乃加以種種之抨擊。而印度政府仍置之不聞。後此人計窮。乃思得一策。送一精美之汽車與印度王。印度王樂甚。乃日駕此精美之汽車遊於街上。詎料不久此車卽毀壞。乃詢此英人何以汽車甚美而損壤甚易。英人乃吿以道路不良之故。印度王乃限令地方官卽日改良道路。僱用路工萬人司其事。不數日印度之道路皆改良完成。而此英人之計遂得售。其後汽車可安全行駛。然印度政府之輕視汽車事業。不久卽遭亡國之禍。雖非亡於此。亦有相當　因也」。</p>
<p>希特勒述此故事。在譏印度政府不知建設。致遭亡國之慘。而鼓勵德國人之建築事業也。希特勒之平日視人生短促。光陰至堪寳貴。而我人因從事於職務。在路送上所消耗之光陰。至堪痛惜。故主張廣事普及交通器具。而二十世紀之交通利器。除火車之外。惟由汽車足為陸地之上之重要交通器具。因之希特勒之提携汽車事業。不遺餘力。而今日德國之汽車事業所以能達如是之一日者。亦為希特勒之扶助於上。而德國人民之努力於後也。</p>
<p>希特勒扶助汽車事業之計劃。可以三項。一為汽車之經濟普遍。使德國人人皆有乘汽車之可能。一為道路之縝密設計。以冀保持安全及使汽車之壽命延長。一為汽車之機件堅固。實事求是。不尙虛華。其初步之工作在使德國全國無汽車之輸入。凡德國人皆用德國車。而後推廣至各國。使人知世上有德國汽車之長處。而與他國之汽車業頡頏也。</p>
<p>最近希特勒已聯合汽車企業中人共立汽車製造廠。僱用失業工人製造汽車。其所定之目標中。有一靈活之小車定名為班格美Pagmy者。其意義為短小精悍。此項汽車已廣見於全德各地。而歐洲各國亦有所見。以價低而物美。不過外觀欠於富麗。然一般人皆樂於購用現在柏林市上每車十輛中必有此車三四輛。該汽車之車身形狀甚小。用油至為經濟。而適合於長途或短程之使用。高速力每小時可逹五十英里。凡今日歐洲之汽車購主欲買小汽車者。必以班格美汽車為最先之目的物。可見此車不久將由歐洲漸侵入於亞洲美洲之市塲也。</p>
<p>希特勒之道路計劃已布置就緒。全德國之汽車道路。每一市城可以直達。而道中則油站遍佈。决無中途乏油之苦。此項事業為各國執政者所注意。而英國亦已着手步希特勒之後　。然則前者希特勒欲使德國汽車業霸古　　。　在可能之中也。</p>

<p>(Tokyo) British Government Chief Economic Advisor Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, accompanied by British Ambassador Sir Robert Clive, today visited the Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Koki, Vice Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru, and held talks for two hours. It is reported that they frankly exchanged opinions and information regarding China's currency system and economic situation. Ross stated that the British government found many discrepancies in the rumors concerning China's economic situation and currency system, and therefore wished to obtain the most accurate information. He also stated that the British government had not authorized him to negotiate any economic assistance to China. The British government is willing to maintain close contact with the Japanese government regarding China's economic recovery. Hirota is reported to have replied that it is very difficult for Europeans to fully understand China's current financial situation. Regarding China's economic recovery, if the United Kingdom, based on Ross's investigation, formulates a concrete plan and discusses it with Japan, Japan is prepared to cooperate with the United Kingdom to the best of its ability. The Emperor of Japan has granted Ross an audience at the palace, tentatively scheduled for September 17. Ross is scheduled to depart from Kobe for Shanghai by ship on the 18th. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen, regarding the joint attack on bandits on the Great Wall Line and the maintenance of治安 within the war zone, visited Commander Tada of the Japanese Garrison Command, and Chief of Staff Sakai, at the Japanese Garrison Headquarters in the afternoon of the 10th for talks. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen stated that bandit suppression in Wenan and Ba counties of Hebei Province is proceeding smoothly, and large bandit gangs have disintegrated into smaller groups. Currently, Zhao Dehuai's gang is causing trouble only in the areas of Shunde and Daming. Troops have previously been sent to suppress them, and they have fled to Neihuang County in Henan Province. The provincial government is still planning to use the Wenan-Ba county bandit suppression method to achieve thorough elimination, dividing the entire province into districts for bandit suppression. It is planned to divide the entire province into thirteen districts and establish commissioners to govern each district, but it is currently being delayed due to insufficient funding. He plans to stay in Tianjin for two or three days before returning to Baoding. After returning, his first priority will be to reorganize the militia throughout the province. At present, the militia in various counties is numerous but of mixed quality, and lacks the ability to defend the local areas. It has been decided to implement a process of elimination to make them useful. The Department of Civil Affairs has drafted measures, awaiting approval before implementation. After the Political Readjustment Committee is dissolved, the central government has not yet assigned responsibility for diplomacy in Hebei Province. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen stated that since the capture of the main culprit Li Zhenhua in the Liu Zhilu assassination case, there have been no new discoveries recently. Regarding the joint Sino-Japanese attack on bandits on the Great Wall Line, when he left Beiping on the 9th, he met with Takeshita Yoshiharu, the head of the Japanese intelligence agency in Shanhaiguan, who also expressed the need for rapid stabilization of the banditry and local unrest in the war zone. They exchanged views on the issue, including cracking down on ronin in the war zone. A method will be decided upon in the short term and implemented immediately. The powers of the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Security Command do not conflict with those of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison Command. He and Song Zheyuan have long-standing friendships. How to govern in the future to ensure local peace and tranquility is the ultimate goal. There is no power struggle between individuals. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen visited Song Zheyuan at Song's residence on 17th Road, British Concession, in Tianjin at noon on the 10th, and discussed the security of Beiping-Tianjin and the Tianjin-Qinhuangdao Security Command for a long time. Shang himself is scheduled to return to Baoding on the 13th. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The commanders of the war zone security teams, Zhang Yantian, Zhang Qingyu, and Li Yunsheng, met with Yin Rugeng to discuss bandit suppression in the war zone. After several discussions, two methods were decided: 1. Focus on blocking and guarding to prevent bandits from penetrating deep into the war zone; 2. The war zone will be strictly inspected by each county to prevent the resurgence of lurking elements. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telephone call from Xinglong County this morning stated that the bandits occupying Xinli Village have moved forward again, attempting to disrupt the area. Zhang Qingyu, the commander of the first security team, has ordered the team to be transferred to the vicinity of Malan for strict precautions, and to launch a fierce attack when the bandits approach. Zhang Qingyu, Zhang Yantian, and Li Yunsheng, the commanders of the first, second, and third security teams, have all come to Beiping to jointly discuss bandit suppression methods. Yin Rugeng, the Commissioner of the Luan-Yu District, hosted a dinner for Zhang and others this afternoon. Yin is scheduled to return to Tangshan tomorrow, and Zhang and others will also return to their respective defense posts to oversee everything. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Over 200 bandits from Erlangmiao, near Yuguan, completely destroyed the electrical grid around the Sanqingguan area in Xiguan, planning to raid the city. The police discovered and intercepted them, and fierce fighting broke out near Erlangmiao. After about two hours, the bandits were unable to hold out and fled into the green cornfields under the Great Wall. Special precautions have been taken in the vicinity of Shanhaiguan since the night of the 8th. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandits from Huaguoshan in Fushun robbed the villages of Yinzhuang on the 8th. Zhang Yantian's security team rushed to encircle and attack them early on the 9th. The bandits relied on the mountainous terrain to resist, and set up mat sheds on the mountains, intending to occupy them for a long time. The security team failed in their uphill attack. Troops from the garrison camp were mobilized to reinforce them on the evening of the 9th. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandits from Yiyuankou on the Great Wall were defeated by a team sent by the second security team. Twenty bandits were captured alive. The remaining bandits fled outside the pass. The security team near Suizhong was demobilized on the 9th. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">How to Resolve the Liujiang Coal Mine Case? <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>The Huashang Liujiang Coal Mine in Linyu County, Hebei Province, is located in an area of special influence, resulting in the Black Mountain Kiln mining area being occupied by the Sino-Japanese joint venture Taiji Coal Mine Company. This dispute has lasted for half a year. The Ministry of Industries and the Hebei Provincial Government have successively sent personnel to investigate. The Special Commissioner and the Japanese Consul in Tianjin have also made several trips to negotiate. The Liujiang representative and Taiji manager Ishida Hisatomo have repeatedly negotiated directly. However, the situation remains deadlocked. The shareholders of Liujiang Company are mostly Shanghai merchants, and the delay in resolving this case has resulted in significant losses. Therefore, the shareholders held a general meeting in Shanghai last Sunday and decided on two options: (1) Seek judicial resolution. File a lawsuit with the Hebei court against Sun Baoqi, the Chinese registered representative of Taiji Company, and file a lawsuit with the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin against Taiji Company, arguing according to reason; (2) Transfer the mining rights, but adhering to the principle of not harming national sovereignty and shareholder interests. The final attitude of Liujiang has been decided, and the negotiation should be more specific.</p>
<p>The area in dispute between Liujiang and Taiji is the Zhang Dexun mining area south of Liujiang's Lizhi Mine and east of Taiji's Shimenzhai Mine, locally known as Black Mountain Kiln. The mining area is triangular in shape and covers an area of 1,207 mu. On July 2, 1914, Zhang Dexun drew a prospecting map of the mining area and submitted it to the First Mining Supervision Office for approval for trial exploration. On September 8 of the same year, he received a prospecting permit. On August 2, 1916, the original applicant applied to change the exploration to mining and requested to merge the mining with Liujiang's Lizhi Mine for joint exploitation. On November 3, 1920, he received a mining permit. This is the process by which Liujiang acquired the mining rights of Black Mountain Kiln. However, on August 10, 1914, Japanese citizen Mitani Suejiro, in the name of Sun Jiwu, the representative of Taiji, applied to explore for coal in Shimenzhai. His prospecting map also included Black Mountain Kiln. In 1916, Taiji applied to change the exploration to mining. In March 1917, he received a mining permit. When the competent authority issued the prospecting permit, it noted that there was a duplication with the previously filed application of Zhang Dexun and ordered Taiji to clearly indicate on the map that Black Mountain Kiln should be left to Zhang Dexun for exploitation. The issue of priority that Liujiang and Taiji are now contesting originates from this. In terms of facts and reasons, Liujiang has been exploiting the mine for nearly twenty years without any disputes. After the dispute arose this spring, the issue of who has priority has also been determined by the Hebei Construction Bureau, the competent authority, based on the results of the survey. On April 29, it issued a directive confirming that the mining rights belong to Liujiang Company. However, Taiji has resorted to the power of the Japanese police, taking advantage of the so-called "today of治安 adjustment" to seal up Liujiang Company's warehouses and wharves in Qinhuangdao. This is clearly an overreach.</p>
<p>Based on the current situation, the resolution of this case will likely follow one of three paths. The first is legal resolution. This is the proper way to resolve disputes. The Liujiang shareholders' meeting also made this resolution. However, when the representatives of Liujiang and Taiji negotiated at the Guandong Army's Shanhaiguan Special Affairs Agency on August 15, the head of the Special Affairs Agency, Iga Seiichi, did not express approval. Yuan Tai, the Magistrate of Linyu County, also stated that "facts and laws should be discussed, but the situation must also be considered." This shows that the power of law is sometimes exhausted. The second is Sino-Japanese joint venture. This proposal came from Iga. The Japanese side has proposed that Taiji should have three shares and Liujiang one share as a condition for the joint venture. This clearly means denying most of Liujiang's mining rights. And once implemented, it would inevitably be a joint venture in name only, but controlled in reality. Therefore, the Liujiang shareholders' meeting did not make this resolution. The third is transfer. Both Liujiang and Taiji have made this proposal. Taiji has offered a price of 300,000 yuan, which leaves room for bargaining. In an impossible situation, this path may be unavoidable. However, if this is the resolution, the so-called non-infringement of national sovereignty may only be a hope on paper.</p>

<p>(Geneva) According to the French delegation, French Prime Minister Laval, who arrived here this morning, does indeed have a new plan to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian case. He will submit it to the League of Nations' Five-Power Committee this afternoon. Laval met with British Foreign Secretary Hoare at 11:00 AM this morning. The content of the meeting is being kept strictly confidential. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After French Prime Minister Laval arrived here this morning, he and British Foreign Secretary Hoare jointly discussed peaceful solutions to the overall dispute. The discussion lasted for over an hour. Hoare then immediately met with Italian Chief Representative Aloisi and is scheduled to confer with Laval again this evening. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Laval left for Geneva at 8:25 PM last night, after receiving the British and Italian ambassadors. According to the "Le Matin" newspaper, the French Prime Minister is not only concerned about the sanctions issue but also fears that the UK's resolute attitude on the sanctions issue will have a serious impact on resolving European issues such as the Danube and Eastern European pacts. A "Paris Soir" report from Rome states that Mussolini assured Laval that Italy does not oppose international co-management of Abyssinia. The prolongation of the East African war and fears of conflict between Italy and Britain are gradually causing some elements in Italy to lean towards reconciliation. The Italian government hopes that the League of Nations' Five-Power Committee will recommend international assistance to Abyssinia, placing the country under a protected status, and hopes that the details of this assistance will be determined by the signatory countries of the 1906 Tripartite Treaty. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa. As a result of all-night discussions by the Imperial Council, a resolution has been telegraphed to Abyssinia's League of Nations representatives, stating that the Abyssinian Emperor is prepared to accept the suggestion that the Abyssinian government hire European advisors. This is the final concession. The League of Nations is free to propose any candidates, but the Abyssinian Emperor reserves the right of approval. However, he firmly rejects any suggestion to place Abyssinia under a mandate, as this would undermine Abyssinia's sovereignty and independence. The Abyssinian Emperor is also willing to cede the Ogaden Province in the southeast to Italy, and allow the construction of a highway from Italian Eritrea to Jiangda, which is in northern Abyssinia, 200 kilometers from the Italian border. He is also willing to resume the 1928 negotiations to discuss a highway from the Abyssinian capital to the Eritrean southern port of Assab. Although this news has been widely circulated, the Governor of Arusi, between Addis Ababa and Ogaden, has already been ordered to lead 25,000 troops to Ogaden for deployment. This march will take at least ten days to reach its destination. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political circles here today are expressing doubt about the possibility of resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute through Geneva mediation. Someone asked the authorities, citing the Abyssinian capital's claim that the Abyssinian Emperor considered September 4th as the "final hour." The authorities shrugged and replied, "We are preparing to deal with the situation every day." This statement seems to be true, as judging from the appearances, the Italian army is currently preparing to begin its offensive at the end of September. According to a dispatch from Addis Ababa, Emperor Haile Selassie's attitude remains quite firm. It is said that the Abyssinian Emperor does not agree with the tripartite trusteeship, or the Italian protection system like Britain in Iraq, or the establishment of an Italian gendarmerie system. Furthermore, according to the Italian Embassy in Abyssinia, the actions of the Italian army in Eritrea as reported in the bulletin are merely routine and have no other significance.

<p>(Geneva) The Special Committee of the League of Nations is now very enthusiastic in its work. If it can maintain the current pace, its work can be completed in a few days. The Italian memorandum accusing Abyssinia of not being qualified for League of Nations membership, and the Abyssinian government's promised reply, will be reviewed by a small group of experts. Representatives from Britain, France, Poland, Spain, and Turkey will join this committee. The Abyssinian Emperor has placed himself entirely at the disposal of the League of Nations. Any resolution that does not hinder the integrity of Abyssinia's territory and political independence is likely to be accepted by the Abyssinian Emperor. The UK has also officially announced its position that any suggestion for resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute should allow the Abyssinian government the freedom to accept or reject it. It is too early to say that Abyssinia has rejected the suggestions made in Paris or other suggestions, as no suggestions have been put forward so far. (Reuters Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Administrative Council Subcommittee of the international conference studying a peaceful resolution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute continued to meet from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM today. It reviewed the various files of previous negotiations. In addition, it appointed a committee of experts, chaired by Spanish representative Arivan, to be responsible for reviewing the documents submitted by both Italy and Abyssinia and making a comprehensive analysis. This committee of experts includes representatives from the countries attending the subcommittee. Once the committee of experts completes its review, the subcommittee will proceed with reconciliation work based on this review report. Regarding reconciliation methods, according to the Havas News Agency special correspondent, the League of Nations Administrative Council has broad freedom of action regarding Abyssinia, because when Abyssinia joined the League of Nations, it formally stated that it would follow all the suggestions made by the League of Nations, especially regarding the abolition of slavery, but in practice, it has not yet been effectively implemented. The chairman of the subcommittee, Spanish representative Madariaga, will be in close contact with the representatives of Italy and Abyssinia during the committee's work. Also, today's committee meeting authorized Chairman Madariaga to consult with jurists from various countries currently in Geneva in order to resolve the various legal issues arising from the Italo-Abyssinian conflict, such as the issue of reconciling the mandated territory system with the original sovereignty of League of Nations member states. The subcommittee stipulated that it would continue to adjourn tomorrow. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Power Committee mediating the Abyssinian case met this afternoon and decided to form another committee to select colonial experts from five countries as members, responsible for investigating Italy's accusations against Abyssinia and Abyssinia's defense. It is believed here that organizing a committee of colonial experts will enable Italy to obtain some satisfaction. At the same time, the Five-Power Committee is striving to find a settlement method that does not violate the League of Nations Covenant and the principle of Abyssinia's territorial integrity. However, the League of Nations is not very optimistic about the committee's efforts, as the Italian side may not be able to accept any suggestions from the committee. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times reports that the British representative on the League of Nations Administrative Council's Italo-Abyssinian Dispute Subcommittee has proposed to the subcommittee that the League of Nations establish a collective mandate system in Abyssinia. The subcommittee is currently considering two methods: one is for the League of Nations Administrative Council to directly exercise ruling power and send a senior commissioner to be stationed in Abyssinia; the other is for the signatory countries of the 1906 Treaty, namely Britain, France, and Italy, to jointly exercise mandate power. On the British side, a condition will be put forward, namely that this solution must be accepted by Abyssinia. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Power Special Committee is still committed to thoroughly investigating the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, while rumors are arising from outside, causing great confusion. In fact, the committee has not discussed making major changes to the suggestions put forward by Paris. The Abyssinian representative has agreed to accept any resolution of the Five-Power Special Committee. (Reuters Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the Five-Power Committee, Spanish representative Daliaga, met with Italian representative Aroxi yesterday and requested the Italian government to guarantee that it would not take military action during the committee's work. The Italian side was unwilling to reply, because Italy still retains the right to freedom of action towards Abyssinia. (National News Agency Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly convened this morning. The fact that Soviet Russia failed to obtain a seat in the Presidium is considered surprising here. All major powers have joined the Presidium, except Russia, which was only two votes short. This matter has caused some criticism. This is the second failure for Soviet Russia. In the previous election of vice-presidents of the General Assembly, the chief representatives of six countries, namely Britain, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Mexico, were all elected. Soviet Russia was ranked seventh and failed to be elected. Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Beneš was elected as Chairman of the General Assembly, and the President of the Irish Free State, Mr. de Valera, was elected as Chairman of the Political Committee. After the initial meeting procedures were completed, the General Assembly will debate the report of Secretary-General Avenol. The debate is expected to begin around Wednesday. It is expected that British Foreign Secretary Hoare will deliver his first speech at the General Assembly in his capacity as the UK's chief representative at that time. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations General Assembly elected six vice-presidents yesterday, and the Soviet Union failed to be elected. This news has caused great surprise here, as it is unprecedented for a permanent member of the Administrative Council to fail to be elected. The Daily News reported that the matter was like a drama, and the number of votes obtained by the Soviet Union was less than that of Mexico, which also shows the revival of anti-Russian sentiment among Europeans and Americans. (National News Agency Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The 16th League of Nations General Assembly continued to meet at 5:30 PM this afternoon to elect vice-presidents. France received 46 votes, Britain received 41 votes, Italy received 41 votes, Spain received 38 votes, Belgium received 30 votes, Mexico received 30 votes, and the Soviet Union received 29 votes. All were elected as vice-presidents.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the chairmen of the seven committees of the General Assembly were elected. According to the usual practice of the League of Nations General Assembly, there are seven committees. The list of elected chairmen for this session is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Legal and Regulatory Committee: Dutch representative Limburg was elected as Chairman.</p>
<p>(2) Economic and Financial Committee: Polish representative Chvatetsky was elected as Chairman.</p>
<p>(3) Disarmament Committee: It was decided to temporarily suspend the organization. Budget Committee: Romanian representative Radulescu was elected as Chairman.</p>

<p>(7) Agenda Committee: Swiss representative Motta, Chairman. In addition, the by-election to fill the vacancy of the late Japanese judge Adachi of the Hague International Permanent Court will be decided by the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the General Assembly tomorrow. The re-election of the three non-permanent members of the Administrative Council whose terms have expired, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Mexico, is scheduled to be held on September 16. The General Assembly is now scheduled to hold a plenary session on Wednesday morning, at which British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will deliver speeches.

<h3 id="e23">Hitler's Early Meeting with Italian Ambassador Has No Special Significance, For Convenience to Attend the National Socialist Party Congress <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The early date of Head of State Hitler's reception of the new Italian Ambassador, Attolico, has attracted general attention. Semi-official sources indicate that this move was entirely prompted by the Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress, which will open tomorrow. Hitler is scheduled to leave Berlin tomorrow for a long time and sincerely wishes to receive the Italian Ambassador before his departure so that he can also attend the National Socialist Party Congress with the qualifications of an ambassador, along with the other heads of diplomatic missions. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The new Italian Ambassador, Attolico, gave a speech during the presentation of his credentials yesterday, saying that the mutual friendship between Italy and Germany is of great importance to the European situation. Head of State Hitler replied with the same feeling and expressed the similarities between the ideals of Fascism and National Socialism. German public opinion is very satisfied with this move, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it should not be overemphasized, and said that Germany is willing to maintain good and friendly relations with all countries in the world as always. It can be seen from the fact that Germany signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with Poland in January last year, and then concluded a naval agreement with Britain in June of this year, that the increased friendship between Italy and Germany will not affect its relations with other countries. As for the attitude that Germany has adopted towards the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, it remains absolutely conservative and neutral. Generally, people explain this statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as being mild in tone and intended to dispel suspicions on the part of Britain. However, it is believed that when the German National Socialist Party held a congress in Nuremberg City last year, the former Italian Ambassador did not go to visit. The National Socialist Party Congress is about to be convened soon this year, and the new Italian Ambassador will definitely participate in the grand event in person. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Rome) The Fascist Party is about to hold a mass rally to show the party's solidarity. It is expected that approximately two million Italians from across the country and the colonies will participate. The signal to begin gathering will be personally issued by Mussolini.

Members of the militia will gather in the camps when the signal is issued.

<h3 id="e27">Polish Elections, Number of Voters Greatly Reduced, Actually Accounting for 28.3 Percent <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Warsaw According to the official provisional results of yesterday's House of Representatives election, out of 16,583,000 registered voters, 7,576,687 people participated in the voting, that is, the number of voters only accounted for 46.5 percent of the total number of voters. In the 1930 election, the number of voters accounted for 74.8 percent. It can be seen that the number of voters has decreased by 28.3 percent compared with the previous election. In Warsaw, the number of voters was only 30 percent, and in the cities of Łódź and Kraków, it was 37 percent, but in the provinces of Silesia and Volhynia, the voter turnout rate was higher. Also, during yesterday's voting, most voters, although they did not give up their right to vote, cast many invalid votes. It is estimated that out of the total of more than 7 million votes cast nationwide, up to one million were invalid votes. This layer was not mentioned in the official report. The government explained the reason for the low voter turnout, saying that it was due to bad weather and the opposition party's movement to boycott voting. However, the general public believes that it is a kind of expression of the people's opposition to the new election law, which can be said to be a failure on the part of the government. Among the 208 newly elected members of the House of Representatives, Poles account for 184 seats, Ukrainians account for 19 seats, Jews account for 4 seats, Russians account for 1 seat, and the German ethnic group was not elected. In addition, there are two women in the new House of Representatives. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Baton Rouge: Senator Huey Long, after being shot yesterday, died at Lakeside Hospital at 4:10 this morning. His death had been predicted by doctors hours earlier, as his large intestine was pierced and the bullet had deeply penetrated his intestines, causing internal bleeding that could not be stopped, even after four blood transfusions. Long remained conscious until his death, but was in severe pain and unable to speak. The Governor of Louisiana and his closest friends and family were at his side when he died. State officials immediately took measures to prevent riots. (Ninth National Telegram)</p>
<p>Hyde Park, USA: Upon hearing the news of Senator Huey Long's assassination today, President Roosevelt said, "I am deeply saddened by this action, as the use of violence is contrary to the spirit of America and does not benefit national affairs. Especially now, we should approach difficult problems with a calm and peaceful attitude." It is noted that Huey Long had recently been one of Roosevelt's fiercest critics. (Ninth National Telegram)</p>
<p>Baton Rouge: Upon hearing the report of Senator Long being shot in the Louisiana State Capitol by Dr. Weiss in Hyde Park, New York, President Roosevelt said today that he deeply regretted this assassination. Violence is not in the American spirit and has no place in the consideration of public affairs. Especially today, when handling difficult issues must be done with a calm and rational attitude, violence cannot be tolerated. A hospital bulletin stated that Long's wounds were expected to heal, but according to reliable sources, Long's condition has worsened. A blood transfusion at noon strengthened his pulse, but a second transfusion is needed. Although armed rebellion is unlikely in Louisiana, the atmosphere throughout the state is tense. State police are being deployed to Baton Rouge to protect the Capitol and the hospital where Long is being treated, and the National Guard is prepared to support the police if necessary. The police chief has ordered police to shoot anyone photographing inside or outside the Capitol or hospital. The assassin, Dr. Weiss, was shot dead on the spot by Long's guards. His family has not yet been able to explain the reason for the assassination. Judge Pavie, Weiss's uncle, said that the matter was unrelated to Long's proposal to remove him from his judicial position. The Common Good Association, an anti-Long organization, has not issued a statement, but Long's party is in a state of anxiety. It is reported that Long's guards had received warnings to prevent accidents. If Long dies from his injuries, Louisiana's dictatorial system and wealth redistribution movement will collapse, as Long single-handedly created the political situation in Louisiana. Some predict that if Long dies, Louisiana will have a period of peace, and the state's debt of $100 million can be addressed. (Ninth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Baton Rouge: Louisiana's dictator, Huey Long, died this morning from his injuries. His condition worsened after midnight. Although he received four blood transfusions, his pulse increased to 118, and he was delirious, constantly mumbling about his planned book, "My First Year in the White House." Doctors used oxygen therapy and planned a fifth blood transfusion, but they felt Long had fallen into a coma and there was nothing more they could do. At 4:30 AM, Dr. Anderson, the hospital director, told reporters that Long had a faint breath and the doctors had done their best, but there was no hope. Long passed away at 6:00 AM. Shortly after, his wife and three children left the hospital, their faces covered in tears. Long's last words were, "I don't know what will become of my poor college students," referring to Louisiana State University, which Long strongly supported. Governor Allen of Louisiana stated that the greatest economic builder Louisiana has produced, the likes of which have not been seen in the past 25 years, has passed away. He was a champion of human rights in America, and his name will never be forgotten in Louisiana and throughout the United States. With Long's death, President Roosevelt will have one less formidable opponent in next year's election. The assassin, Dr. Weiss, was buried this afternoon in the local cemetery, with hundreds of people attending, mostly from the Baton Rouge medical community and members of the Common Good Association, an anti-Long group. The House of Representatives met last night and did not mention Long's assassination, but passed a bill to prevent Judge Pavie, the assassin Weiss's uncle and Long's political opponent, from being re-elected. Long was born on August 30, 1893, into a poor family. His father was a pig farmer. Long graduated from a rural school, but attended university and law school for one year each. He later worked as a book and lard salesman. He became a lawyer in 1915 and served as a railroad commissioner, public service commissioner, governor, and was elected to the Washington Senate in 1930. Long became the sole political figure in the state, and under his power, Louisiana became a dictatorial state within the United States. Except for churches and the publishing industry, no public undertaking was not under his control. He held absolute power and allowed no interference from opposing parties.

<p>New Orleans, USA: From all indications here today, if Senator Huey Long does not recover, the political dictatorship in Louisiana will be completely destroyed because Long's associates control state affairs. These people will start infighting as soon as Long dies. Today, Long's wife and two children visited him at the hospital. When they left, they seemed calm and said that Long had said when he entered the hospital, "I may not return home, but I am determined to fight to the death." (Ninth National Telegram)</p>
<p>Baton Rouge, USA: Senator Huey Long, who was seriously injured in yesterday's assassination, is now completely hopeless. His friends emerged from the sickroom and said that Senator Long would probably not survive the night. Doctors have used oxygen resuscitation and have performed the third and fourth blood transfusions. Later, a dozen doctors gathered to discuss the final rescue plan. Outside the sickroom, Long's family and the Governor of Louisiana were holding their breath, and frequently approached the bedside, their weeping audible. Long's mind is still clear, but he cannot speak, and he can still recognize his wife. He shows a weak smile each time he sees her. The whole state is very silent today, and the state government organization is also showing signs of shaking. Everyone is contemplating what will happen after Long's death. Three regiments of state troops have been mobilized in New Orleans today, and the state House of Representatives has extended its session until tomorrow morning. After receiving the bill, the state Senate will likely pass it quickly. The murderer, Weiss, was killed on the spot by Long's guards. A simple funeral was held today, attended by thousands of people. Prominent anti-Long leaders, such as Congressman Sanders and former Governor Parker, stood bareheaded in the heavy rain to express their condolences. (Ninth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) National political commentators, observers, and professional politicians today have various speculations about Senator Huey Long's injuries. It is generally believed that whether or not there is hope, it will ultimately affect the national political situation. If he does not recover, the political power in Louisiana will collapse, and the possibility of a third party being formed in the American South to compete with Roosevelt in next year's election will disappear. However, if he recovers, he may gain popular support as a martyr and may be able to regain the prestige he has recently lost. (Ninth National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Republican National Committee issued a statement today, stating that in President Roosevelt's correspondence with Howard, chairman of the Howard newspaper group, the President said that business has had a chance to breathe, which is actually useless because what the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors need is a complete cessation of the New Deal, not a chance to breathe. The President and Howard's mutual promotion seems to be an attempt to give Howard an excuse to maintain his narrow attitude in his newspapers to support the President and advocate Roosevelt's re-election. The President certainly does not want such a famous journalist to raise embarrassing questions, so Howard has never mentioned issues such as inflation, budget balance, and the President's desire to force the Constitution to align with socialist policies.

<p>Athens: Last night at midnight, while the cabinet was meeting to discuss holding a referendum to resolve the restoration issue, a fierce conflict erupted outside the building between General Panayotakos, leading Republican military officers, and guards belonging to the monarchist faction. For a time, the entire city of Athens was thrown into chaos, fearing that Greece would once again experience a large-scale civil war. Panayotakos and his brother were both injured and have been sent to the hospital for treatment. With Panayotakos injured, the Republican elements in the army are without a leader, so the overall situation is very bleak. Panayotakos had summoned the national garrisons in an attempt to prevent Army Chief Kondylis from pressuring Prime Minister Tsaldaris to declare support for the restoration. Kondylis, known for his strong tactics, immediately ordered Panayotakos's arrest, but the Republican warlords, with the support of the Prime Minister, refused to submit, and the war broke out. Dozens of people were arrested in the operation. The cabinet meeting was abruptly ended. When the Prime Minister stepped out of the cabinet meeting room, he reportedly told a delegation of royalists waiting at the door that he strongly supported the restoration. (Tenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek Prime Minister Tsaldaris, who returned from vacation in southern Germany yesterday, declared that the public vote to resolve the restoration issue will be held as planned. Today, rumors are rampant, indicating that the cabinet is divided on the issue of restoring the monarchy. It is claimed that Army Chief Kondylis and the Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs threatened to resign at today's cabinet meeting because they did not agree with Tsaldaris's view that the government must remain neutral before the vote. Kondylis said that the restoration is a done deal because two-thirds of the people are inclined toward the monarchy. (Ninth National Society Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) Mining representatives told the Associated Press today that mine owners are very dissatisfied with the government's silver purchase plan. When Congress passed the silver enhancement bill, it originally hoped to raise the price of silver to $1.29 per ounce, but the current policy of the Ministry of Finance is not only far from this standard, but also tends to depress the market price by dumping its accumulated silver. However, although mine owners are dissatisfied with the policy of the Ministry of Finance, they also recognize that general business has indeed improved considerably. (Ninth National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Commerce and Industry, Communications, and Agriculture and Forestry will hold a joint meeting this afternoon to decide on instructions for the Japanese-Egyptian trade talks. The representative will take these instructions to Egypt to attend the meeting and begin negotiations. It is reported that the content of the instructions is generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese government advocates continuing to adopt the Japanese-Egyptian Treaty of Commerce established in 1930.</p>
<p>(2) The Egyptian government intends to adopt measures such as compensatory exchange tax and import allocation system to prevent the entry of Japanese cotton cloth. However, the Egyptian government should first note that Japan is a country that purchases a large amount of Egyptian cotton, and the implementation of the allocation system will result in sacrifices for the consumer class, and it is hoped that British and Egyptian exporters will benefit.</p>
<p>(3) Last year, Japan exported 46.79 million yuan of cotton cloth, 8.07 million yuan of rayon, 3.6 million yuan of silk fabrics, and 620,000 yuan of ceramics and porcelain to Egypt. The exports are centered on cotton cloth. Egypt only exports cotton to Japan. Therefore, the adoption of an allocation quota system is very unfavorable to Japan, so Japan opposes the adoption of this system. (Tenth Japan United Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-Egypt trade conference will soon be held in Cairo. The relevant ministries decided on countermeasures at a meeting of relevant ministry officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th. As a result, the outline of the instructions carried by Representative Kasama was determined. However, Egypt is different from India. The main customer of Egyptian cotton is Britain, and Japan only ranks third. Therefore, if a commodity exchange system is adopted between Egyptian cotton and Japanese cotton products, it will be unfavorable. Therefore, it will proceed based on most-favored-nation treatment. Representative Kasama, after negotiating the detailed agreement, is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on September 18, take the Yasukuni Maru, which sets sail from Kobe on the 20th, to Singapore, and then take a regular flight to Cairo.

<p>Inspection Report on River Disaster Conditions - Special Correspondent Geng Ya Reports From Dongzhuang to Xuzhou</p>
<p>Returning to Kaifeng from Dongzhuang, along the embankment, first passing through Zhukou, which is the second most dangerous engineering structure in Shandong. The main current of the Yellow River, coming from the northwest, once it impacts the great embankment, abruptly turns eastward. The embankment is in imminent danger. Fortunately, everyone is alarmed by the great disaster at Dongzhuang, supervising and protecting it. The embankment workers also know their responsibilities are crucial and are particularly courageous, finally turning danger into safety and singing the triumphant song of "Man will conquer nature." Entering the territory of Hebei, passing through Liuzhuang, the tense atmosphere of dike defense is no different from what was seen when coming. Traveling westward, the river surface gradually widens, the main current flows in the middle, and the waves are turbulent. The flow on both sides is gentler, and the waves are small like scales. Near the shore, there are no ripples at all. The color of the water is also different. The red embankment and green willows are completely reflected. However, the flow of the Yellow River is unpredictable. The azure blue reflects the water surface, as smooth as a mirror, but the bottom of the embankment is often hollowed out by undercurrents, which are more difficult to prevent than rat holes or badger burrows. As the saying goes, "The water of the Yellow River comes from the sky," which refers to this kind of phenomenon that is impossible to guard against. Later, entering Henan Province, the willows on the bank are lush, the river is wide and the flow is far, and the water is no longer seen. The dikes are high and thick, and dangerous places are replaced with stone works. After years of repair and protection, the foundation is increasingly consolidated. This autumn's protection project is actually easier to start than in Shandong and Hebei. However, the riverbed is much higher than the ground, which is ultimately not a fortunate thing for the future. The Huiji River, which diagonally runs through Kaifeng, Chenliu, Qixian, Suixian, and other places, does not have enough water source. In the twenty-first year of the Republic, the government specially purchased eight siphon pipes, intending to install them separately at Liuyuankou and Heigangkou, to draw water from the Yellow River to supplement its source. This is to use the principle of high river and low ground to achieve the effect of water conservancy. At Liuyuankou (thirty to forty li north of Kaifeng city), two siphon pipes were installed last winter, and the water flowed out quite smoothly. If all six remaining pipes are installed, the water drawn out, after being clarified in the water pond, flows into the Huiji River, which can irrigate 200,000 mu of land. The Yellow River flow can be reduced. If the downstream areas are expanded, the benefits will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Returning to Kaifeng, taking the Longhai night train eastward, suddenly there was a commotion in the first-class carriage at Xinglong Station. Upon inquiry, it was learned that a newly boarded male passenger, seeing that other compartments were crowded, shared a compartment with a female passenger but slept in separate berths. The ticket inspector said that because the genders were strangers, it was inconvenient to share a compartment on the train, even though there were no explicit regulations, but custom had become a rule, and all railway lines followed it carefully, firmly ordering the male passenger to move to another compartment. The male passenger then said that they had just exchanged pleasantries and learned that the lady was a student at a university in Nanjing, and he was an employee of a cultural organization in Shanghai. Although they were not old acquaintances, they were both intellectuals. If he was forced to move to another compartment, it would clearly be guarding against some kind of relationship, no less than despising their personalities, and trampling on the personality of Chinese people by Chinese people. He argued on principle and refused to comply. Later, after others persuaded him, the matter was settled. The male passenger's personality was strong, but the railway authorities were also meddlesome. Twenty li northwest of the station, there is a legend of the tomb of Cangjie and the platform for creating characters, with a tall monument standing, and lush trees. Eight li east of Luo Wang Station, there is Liu Hou's tomb, with towering ancient trees, vaguely visible.</p>
<p>Lanfeng Station is two li away from the county seat. The terrain of the urban area is lower than the Yellow River, and the old course of the Yellow River is close to the city walls. Every time there is a flood season, there is great concern about accidents. There is a motor road that leads west to Kaifeng and northeast to Kaocheng. From Eryiji to the Yellow River Estuary, it is also accessible by car. The main product is peanuts, with about 10,000 tons shipped to Shanghai and Qingdao annually. The stations in the east and west are all known for producing peanuts. Neihuang Station is named after Neihuangji, which belongs to Qixian. The market town was formerly Waihuang County. Xiang Yu attacked it unsuccessfully and angrily wanted to bury its people alive. A thirteen-year-old retainer, Er, persuaded Xiang to spare them. The people of the town cherished his virtue and built a shrine to him, which still exists today. Minquan County was formerly Libaji, belonging to Suixian. A new county was established in the seventeenth year of the Republic. The city is seven li away from the station and is now gradually becoming prosperous. Liuhe belongs to Ningluxian, with abundant products, annually shipping wheat, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains to various counties in western Henan, and peanuts and melon seeds to Shanghai and other places, each about 1,000 tons. There are also saltpeter, alkali, and wooden boards, which are also sold to the east and west of the railway, in varying amounts each year, from hundreds of tons. The station is 200 li northeast of the Dongzhuang opening. It is heard that the Dike Closure Committee will borrow the old track materials from the Jiaoji Railway and lay them from here to Dongzhuang to transport stone materials for closing the opening. First, dams are built on both sides to occupy the area, and then stones are thrown in the middle to join them. This is a shortcut, and the method is especially good. It is hoped that it will be implemented quickly and not delayed any further.</p>
<p>Shangqiu, the ancient capital of Emperor Ku, was the place where Shang Tang moved to reside in Nanhao, located in the southeast of the county. It was later the State of Song and is now the leading county in eastern Henan, where the Second District Administrative Inspectorate is located. There are many agencies in the city, especially schools. Secondary education includes provincial high schools, county normal schools, and jointly established agricultural and forestry schools, and private Cuiying schools. Primary education includes the normal school affiliated high school, the county girls' high school, the first high school, and ten elementary schools. There are Guidet Daily and Yudong Guide newspapers. Financial institutions include the Henan Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and five or six Datong Silver Houses. Historical sites include the Mausoleum of Emperor Ku, 45 li south of the city, the Mausoleum of Suirenshi, northwest of Botai, and the Xili Shrine, about three li southeast of the city, where Confucius came to Song and practiced rituals with his disciples under a large tree. Later generations built a shrine to worship him, and Wenyatai, a stone monument with a portrait of the Supreme Sage painted by Wu Daozi, Zhang Xun's Tomb, is located on the plateau north of the city, the Kaiyuan Temple, built in the Tang Dynasty, with Yan Zhenqing writing the inscription and calligraphy, engraved on a stone pillar, with Ming people building a pavilion to cover it, Gaoqiu, three li southwest of the city, is the tomb of Botai, the Xiaolie General Temple, in Yingguozhen, southeast of the county, dedicated to Hua Mulan, who took her father's place in the army, with the eighth day of the fourth month as her false birthday, incense is prosperous, and there is a large output of miscellaneous grains, cattle and sheep skins, and industrial products, such as Wanshou silk and various kinds of printed cloth bedsheets, are also quite popular in various counties in western Henan and Hao County in Anhui. Hao County is more than a hundred li away from here and can be reached by car. Mamuji, forty li southeast of the city, is located near the railway and has prosperous commerce, known as "Little Guide, that is, Shangqiu". Dongxing passed Yangji Station again and entered Dangshan County, Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Dangshan County City, 3 li southwest of the station, 50 li south of the city, has Dangshan Mountain, from which the county gets its name. Now it belongs to Yongcheng County, Henan. There are the Tomb of Chen Sheng and the Tomb of Prince Xiao of Liang. The area is covered with mulberry fields, with trees everywhere, which is very different from the sorghum and cotton fields all over Henan Province. Because the breach at Dongzhuang has not been blocked, the Yellow River's water is invading southern Jiangsu, causing disasters in Pei and Feng counties, and Dangshan is gradually being affected. The future is worrying. Products include wheat, soybeans, Dangshan pears, daylilies, etc., with a total of more than 20,000 tons shipped to Tianjin, Shanghai, and other ports annually. Although it is threatened by the Yellow River this autumn, the area has not had rain for a long time, and the crops are withered and yellow, showing drought. The train passed Haozhai and was about to reach Tongshan. It rained at noon, and the weather suddenly cooled.</p>
<p>Disembarking at Xuzhou, I happened to see a company of soldiers, about a company's worth, carrying shovels and hoes, walking quickly across the overpass from the station. Behind them were twenty or thirty laborers, carrying hemp bags in pairs, their footsteps resounding on the ground, their expressions particularly tense. Their purpose, I was sure I knew it without having to ask. I unloaded my luggage at the Huayuan Hotel and then went to the Qingliange Zaotang for a bath. The noises from each seat were deafening, and most of them were talking about the disaster prevention situation. Some criticized Shandong Province for its negligence in breaching the dike and the delay in closing the opening. Others regretted that the construction of dikes in northern Jiangsu had little effect and advocated that a way out for the Yellow River water should be sought as soon as possible. The people were fearful, sighing and lamenting. The extent of the flood disaster in Xuzhou could be imagined. A pamphlet on business improvement was posted on the wall of the bathhouse, stating that in view of the current social and economic difficulties and the promotion of a new lifestyle, in order to develop business and save money for customers, prices had been reduced and no tips were accepted. The arrangement was clean and tidy, and the prices were indeed not expensive. I tried to give a tip, but they politely declined. No wonder the various businesses in Xuzhou were depressed, but this bathhouse was thriving. Those who tried to imitate it failed because they were not thorough enough. As the saying goes, "Those who earn five cents of profit starve to death, while those who earn three cents of profit are well-fed." This is indeed the business strategy of changing tricks to win in today's light-duty market.</p>

<p>Impressions of a Southern Tour</p>
<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>Since the completion of the People's Militia organization in Guizhou Province and the rigorous training of village chiefs by cadres, the grassroots foundation of the People's Militia has become increasingly stable. The most obvious result is the complete eradication of bandits in the province. Guizhou Province has a vast territory and sparse population, making it extremely easy for bandits to hide. Moreover, they would be suppressed in one place and flee to another, making it impossible to wipe them out with military force alone. Therefore, before the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Guizhou Province had a large number of bandits, entrenched in various places, causing harm to travelers and merchants. Almost as soon as the People's Militia organization succeeded, villages had self-defense forces, and they surrounded and suppressed the bandits in all directions, eliminating all the bandits. The areas where the People's Militia showed the greatest strength in suppressing bandits were Liu, Qing, Xun, Wu, and Yu, followed by Pinggui and Yong. The left and right rivers also had considerable achievements. According to local authorities, there are no traces of bandits left in the province. In remote mountainous areas, there may still be a few bandits, but at most no more than ten people in each place. They are trying to track them down and encircle them, and they expect to wipe them all out within the year. The reporter traveled by car along the highway for six days, driving more than six thousand miles, and the journey was extremely peaceful, with no traces of bandits. Mr. Pan Xinchao of the Fourth Army Group Headquarters, who accompanied me, did not carry any weapons. The car drove through desolate areas where there were no people for several hours and no armed guards. This was an opportune time for ambush, but they were able to travel unhindered. When approaching Longzhou, it was already after 7:00 PM. The car was driving through the mountains, and the evening clouds were closing in. The car had to use headlights to see the road and move forward slowly. There was no one to call for help in front or behind. Anyone with a gun on the road could have robbed the entire car and escaped leisurely, but it was also peaceful. This proves that the claim that there are no bandits in Guizhou Province is true. Facts speak louder than words. The reporter originally planned to drive back to Nanning from Longzhou on a moonlit night. Mr. Pan, who was traveling with me, said that the moonlight illuminates the mountain scenery, and there is poetry everywhere. It would be best to bring wine along, but unfortunately the sky was cloudy that night, so it did not happen. The local news in the newspapers in Shanghai is full of reports of robbery and looting, whereas the peace on the roads in Guizhou and the absence of bandits are examples to be followed. Along the way, Mr. Pan pointed out to me and said, "This is where bandits used to come and go, this is the lair of bandits." Now travelers are passing along the road, farmers and villagers are carrying things back and forth, bustling and peaceful. It is completely different from the past. As for the remnants of the Communist Party members Zhang Yuanqun, Li, and Rui in Guizhou Province, they have long been wiped out with the cooperation of the People's Militia. Last year, when Xiao Ke, Zhu De, and other troops of the western expedition passed through the area, the People's Militia of Guiliu and Pingse counties assisted the army in defense and suppression, encircling and attacking them head-on, killing 5,000 bandits. The army captured 7,000, and the People's Militia captured about 5,000, seizing hundreds of light and heavy machine guns and tens of thousands of rifles. The People's Militia and army suffered about 2,000 casualties, while the bandits suffered more than 20,000 casualties. Secondly, the People's Militia is engaged in road construction. The counties assign this work of provincial, county, and township roads to the soldiers of the People's Militia reserve teams. In addition to paying for bridge and culvert construction, the rest is compulsory labor. It is estimated that the province has completed more than 20,000 li of county roads, and about 10,000 li are open to traffic. Those not yet open to traffic must wait for the completion of bridges and culverts and the removal of stone obstacles before they can be opened to traffic. Those counties where the provincial capital of Nanning can be reached directly from the gates of the county government via the highway have reached 70%. The 30% of counties that cannot be reached are actively under construction. The entire provincial road network can be completed within next year. Completing tens of thousands of miles of roads in about two years with the least amount of money is entirely due to the People's Militia. It is a pity that the time was too rushed, and the road surface engineering was too hasty. Moreover, the slope angles and other aspects do not conform to the principles of engineering, so every time there is a flash flood, the road surface and bridges are often washed away, causing traffic congestion and requiring time for repairs, which is a major shortcoming. The next is afforestation. The counties are actively engaged in afforestation at the order of the Guizhou Provincial Government. They are now being carried out step by step by the village governments supervising the reserve teams. Although there are no significant results, they are already roughly scaled. It is estimated that the counties reported afforestation of more than 13 million trees in 1934, although only 25 counties, and the number of trees in various farms and forests has reached more than 370,000. The next is conscription. The majority of the people in Guizhou Province have a considerable understanding of the policy of placing soldiers in the militia after several years of training in the People's Militia. Therefore, the results of the first conscription order were quite remarkable. The enthusiasm of volunteers to enlist, especially those who have been educated, accounts for the majority. Many of them have graduated from middle school, and those with education account for about 70%. In addition, there is one thing that is also worth mentioning. The women in Guizhou Province are more motivated, thrifty, and hardworking than the men. Most of the men in the countryside sit at home and eat, are lazy to work, engage in jealousy, adultery, and fighting, and indulge in gambling, doing all kinds of evil. Since the establishment of the People's Militia, the village chiefs have forced the farmers to undergo military training and compulsory labor. Lazy men have to carry guns and walk more than ten or even dozens of miles early in the morning to assemble and train. In their spare time from farming, they also do various public works. As they have been used to this for a long time, the lazy have become diligent, and bad customs have been swept away. As a result, there are no beggars seeking food on the streets in the entire province. Those who are beggars are from other provinces. Guizhou has a vast territory and a sparse population and does not suffer from a lack of people to cultivate the land, but from a lack of cultivable land.</p>
<p>In recent years, Guizhou Province has paid close attention to the assimilation of the Yao ethnic group. It has repeatedly sent personnel to the Yao Mountains to promote and guide them, and the results have been good. The Yao people have also successively sent representatives to the province to discuss matters, and the assimilation work has been completed by 70-80%. There are 300,000 to 500,000 Yao people in Guizhou Province, with different languages and customs. Since the implementation of the People's Militia, the Guizhou authorities have also sent personnel to organize them in the Yao areas, giving them the same training. The village chiefs are entirely filled by Yao intellectuals, and they use this to promote basic national education, teaching them the Chinese language. It is heard that the land in the Yao Mountains is fertile and the products are very rich. The people are brave and good at climbing mountains. Assimilation and cooperation will have unlimited development prospects. According to the Guizhou authorities, in the past, the Yao and Miao ethnic groups hated the Han people very much. The reason was that the Han people bullied and oppressed the Yao and Miao due to their low level of knowledge, and the Han officials helped them to exploit them, forming a strong hatred for the Han people. Now that we treat them with kindness, show them the common interests, and provide equal treatment, they will naturally change their hatred into affection. The true foundation of the unity of the five ethnic groups lies here.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Yellow River Dike Closing Project - Construction of a Narrow-Gauge Railway from Liuhe to Dongzhuang - Actively Extending the Jiangsu Dike to Dig a Diversion Channel - The Eleven Provisions for Closing the Dike have been Largely Finalized <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Kong Xiangrong, member of the Economic Commission and supervisor of the Yellow River flood control affairs in Hebei and Henan, advocated extending the Jiangsu Dike, diverting the water to correct the river course, and excavating a diversion channel to reduce the amount of water at the breach, making it easier to close. In addition, he also advocated building a narrow-gauge railway to transport materials. The day before yesterday, he came to Jinan from Kaifeng and exchanged views with Han Fuqu, chairman of the provincial government, and Zhang Honglie, director of the Construction Department and member of the Dike Closing Committee. They have largely reached an agreement. Today (7th) at about 9:00 AM, Zhang Honglie visited Kong at the Shitaiyan Hotel to make a final decision. It is planned to connect the northern end of the Jiangsu Dike to the embankment and build a stone dike to the Li Shengtun Embankment, extending it by 300 zhang in total, requiring an estimated 20,000 square feet of stone. At the same time, a diversion channel will be excavated, starting from the west of Li Shengtun Village to Zhangqiao, with a total length of 6.5 kilometers, a bottom width of 70 meters, and a mouth width of 120 meters. As for the transportation of materials, the original plan was to use the narrow-gauge railway from Lanfeng to Dongbatou, which has now been built. Stone materials can be transported by boat from Lanfeng to Dongbatou and then to Dongzhuang. However, a large amount of materials is needed, and it will take four months to transport them all on this narrow-gauge railway alone. Now it is planned to build another narrow-gauge railway, starting from the Liuhe Station on the Longhai Railway and going directly to the Dongzhuang opening via Heze, with a total length of 200 li. It would be much more convenient to transport materials by both railways. It is estimated that it will take one month to lay the railway and another month to transport all the stone materials. Regarding the materials needed for the 200-li railway, Zhang Honglie has discussed borrowing old materials from the Jiaoji Railway with Lu Mengxiong, a member of the railway committee. Lu has agreed to report to the railway authorities for consultation. Ge Guangting, chairman of the railway committee, will arrive in Jinan from Qingdao in the coming days, and Han will discuss the matter with him. If the railway authorities agree (the railway has enough track materials to lay 500 li), he will report to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. The Dike Closing Committee is working actively to raise funds for closing the dike opening. The engineering team decided to move to Dongzhuang. At the same time, a material factory will be set up in Dongzhuang. Zhou Li, director of the engineering team, Song Wentian, chief engineer, Yu Haomin, director of the material factory, Pan Yifen, chief of the engineering section of the River Affairs Bureau, Li Shilin, chief clerk, and engineers will depart by car tomorrow (8th) at 7:00 PM. The surveying team will also go with them. The party of 50 employees will travel in three long-distance buses and is scheduled to stay overnight in Taochengbu and arrive at their destination the next day. They are scheduled to stay in Dongzhuang for three weeks, but if the time is not enough, they may extend it for another week. Kong Xiangrong is in Jinan to discuss with Han Fuqu, chairman of the provincial government, and the Dike Closing Committee about dike closing, transportation of materials, and protection of Zhukou. A decision has been made, which can be roughly divided into eleven points: 1. Build a diversion dike behind the Jiangsu Dike to divert the water and correct the river course, reduce the flow of water from the breach, and provide relief to the disaster area. 2. The stone materials borrowed from Lanfeng and transported from Baimashan to Lanfeng will be transported to Dongbatou as soon as possible and shipped to the Dongzhuang construction site for use within a few days. 3. The Dike Closing Committee will send personnel to Huangzhuang to prepare for surveying and start construction immediately. 4. The amount of stone materials required for closing the breach is very large, and transportation is difficult. We will actively discuss building a 200-li railway from Lanfeng or Liuhe directly to Dongzhuang for convenient transportation. 5. Before the railway is successfully negotiated and built, we will first expedite the construction of the section of railway from Lanfeng to Dongbatou, about 20 li, and continue the shipping as a temporary means of transportation. 6. We will immediately send personnel to concentrate the borrowed narrow-gauge railway tracks and continue connecting them to supplement the transportation of materials. 7. We will send personnel to the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Jiaoji railways to negotiate for the allocation of vehicles, and negotiate with Longhai for the transportation of Taihushan stones, and ask the Pinghan Railway to allow the purchase of stone materials at Heshangqiao and Luwangfen. 8. Regarding the diversion channel decided to be excavated at the Dongzhuang meeting, we have sent personnel to survey it. As soon as the survey is completed, we will invite bids for construction. 9. At a suitable location on the Jiangsu Dike, we will extend the dike body to divert the flow, consolidate the Jiangsu Dike, and wash away the silt on the opposite bank to guide the flow into the correct course. We plan to investigate the water situation in the coming days and handle it accordingly. 10. Although the Zhukou dangerous project has been rescued and is now stable, for the sake of consolidation, we plan to consolidate the dike section and extend the stone dike at the end of Liuzhuang as a diversion shield. We plan to allocate part of the stone materials transported to Lanfeng to extend the dike. In addition to the 10,000 yuan of flood control funds allocated by Huang Lihui of the Supervision Department from the central government, it is heard that Chairman Han has also allocated 20,000 yuan for disaster relief, which has been handed over to Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, to purchase materials and carry out emergency repairs to prevent autumn floods. 11. Continue to expedite the consolidation of the Dongba base at the east end of the dike closure to prepare for the future closing. It is heard that Kong Xiangrong will stay in Jinan for a few days to discuss everything further. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">A Sensation in Bingzhou: The Truth of the Bribery Case; Yan Xishan Advocates Strict Handling; The Inspection Committee Presents the Original Text to Yan <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Zhang Zhixin, a participant in the Taiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office, Yin Yugui, a member of the Economic Construction Committee, and Zhang Zuojia, a member of the Finance Consolidation Office, etc., were found to have colluded with contractors in a bribery scheme involving the contracting of sleepers for the Datong-Puzhou Railway. The details of the case have now been fully exposed. Yan Xishan also advocates strict handling of this case. The following is the original text presented by the Shanxi Political Inspection Committee to Yan, which is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of Zhang Zhixin, a participant in the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Xian Yugui, a member of the Economic Construction Committee, and Zhang Zuojia, a member of the Finance Consolidation Office of Jin-Sui, colluding with contractors to seek personal gain and conspiring with false evidence in an attempt to conceal their actions, it is earnestly requested that they be prosecuted according to the law. It is investigated that Lingkong Mountain has always been a forest production area in Qinyuan, which is also where the county's resources are located. The sleepers used for the Datong-Puzhou Railway this time are planned to be contracted by merchants in the county to avoid cumbersome procedures. The people of the county also do not lightly abandon this great benefit. As a result, public and private competition arose, and disputes occurred repeatedly. Those who advocate public contracting include the former county magistrate Guo Lantian, gentry Yin Guoyuan, and Zhang Bin, all from the same hometown. They all believe that these sleepers should be contracted by the entire county, which would be more appropriate. If there are any benefits, they can be used for construction purposes. The reasoning is just and beyond reproach. However, those who secretly engage in private contracting include Deng Weicheng and Dong Xuanzheng, two factions who engage in intrigue and competition is also fierce. As a result, Deng Weicheng was able to contract the project as a merchant, which has its reasons. Deng's arrival in the province was due to the summoning of Yin Yugui and Zhang Zuojia. The two men put in extraordinary effort for Deng's affairs, secretly colluding with Zhang Zhixin, the head of the materials group, and others, privately agreeing that after Deng's contract, Zhang Zhixin, Yin Yugui, and a certain important person from Qin (it is not possible to inquire who he is because the person involved has always kept it a secret). , three people, from each sleeper cutting freight within a draw to collect foreign five cents, a total of 700,000 sleepers (the original package of 700,000 sleepers, later changed to 200,000 sleepers, the actual payment of 197,000 sleepers), but also extracted 35,000 yuan, still afraid of regret, assuming the name of Fushou Hall, and Zheng Weicheng and others signed a contract in advance, as a certificate, the Yin Yugui and other three people, due to official relations, the Department of convenience signed and sealed, that is, Zhang Zuojia alone on behalf of the signature, this is the truth of the contract signed on the day. Check the important records on the contract, to Fushou Hall as a body shares, in addition to each sleeper cutting , allocating five points, as the cost of this search for the province's shop to ensure the cost and manpower to raise labor, and may be divided according to the shares of the remaining profits, but not win the loss of money and any other losses, the remaining Wu Gui Hall and Deng Weicheng and other shares, regardless of profit or loss, should be fully responsible, (there is a contract to insert, the contract stipulates that Wu Gui Hall four shares, Fushou Hall a share, Deng Weicheng two shares,) In addition, for Deng Weicheng and other waste Act method, there are also detailed provisions, saying that Wu Gui Hall Deng Weicheng, etc., should be paid in installments to Fushou Hall 35,000 silver foreign dollars, the first payment of 15,000 silver dollars, the second to fifth times each time each payment of 5,000 yuan, (there are documents to check) This is the inside story of Deng Weicheng's undertaking of the sleeper. When Deng Weicheng first received the cutting and shipping fee of 80,000 yuan, the Fushou Hall shareholder Yin Yugui and others, that is, to Taiyuan Deshenghou Bank to deduct 10,000 silver dollars, Later, because Wu Gui Hall shareholder Ren Laiting was greatly dissatisfied, he re-negotiated the withdrawal of 5,000 silver dollars, and actually only deducted 15,000 silver dollars. This is in line with the provision of the payment, and so on. In May of last year, there was suddenly a blood soul assassination group, issued a declaration, revealing the inside story, the Zhang Zhixin and others because of their own reputation, decided to summon Deng Weicheng Xingye to the province, to discuss countermeasures, and Deng to use urgent money, refused to come to the province as a word, they were deeply afraid of internal rupture, for people to take advantage of, willing to deduct the cutting and shipping fee within the transfer of 1,000 silver dollars, as the group point Deng Weicheng's expenses, Deng to the province, they to the individual hidden feelings, not to be exposed, then one side to Deng in the province to stay a few days, strictly keep secrets, one side boldly dissected,(published in Taiyuan newspapers) to not Qingbai, to this the Yin Yugui and other deductions, actually left 14,000 silver dollars, this is the Fushou Hall shareholder's deduction of the situation, and to this year's contract procedures ended, Yin Yugui Zhang Zuojia, and other letters, please Deng Weicheng to the province to settle accounts, arbitrarily difficult, do not slightly relax, and forced Deng out of 2,000 yuan, as the end of the matter, Deng to their oppression too much, not willing to succumb, and presented Qing Sui Department sent personnel to supervise the calculation, so that early settlement, Yin and others also afraid of the situation to expand, with their own disadvantage, the temporary Fushou Hall's top shares, another search for his son Yin Bi Yun Zhang Fenghe (Zhang Fenghe Department Nan Maoquan Pu length is the provincial shop security one) Zhang Zuojia three people topped the name to Deng Weicheng to deal with, when using intimidation, forcing Deng to succumb, claiming that the Sui Department has Zhang tham as the Lord, difficult to order him to win, even if the speed continued to sue, but also in vain, Deng to nowhere to extend, very depressed , Then Director Yan farewelled Minister He (Yingqin) on the day, intercepted and shouted, hoping to get rid of , Then went to the first public security branch, director Chai Jun, will Deng's Jinyang apartment, a major search, all concerning the cutting and shipping sleepers account books and letters, together with the back to the bureau, complex in Deng Weicheng side, found four cents of opium paste, will Deng take the bureau custody. The Yin Yugui and others, thought there was an opportunity to take advantage of, (because Chai is from Qinyuan, the Yin relatives), secretly exercise, the director Chai Jun, Yang borrowed the opium case custody as the name, Yin Cheng coerced the strong pressure, prison Deng's action, in addition to settling accounts, all do not allow freedom, and sent Hao patrol officer to cooperate with shareholders, will search the most important letters, forced to burn, hoping to annihilate the signs of fraud, Deng in the various parties under the coordination, then reluctantly concluded the end, another fill of 1,000 yuan, the account ended , is the Yin Yugui and others forced to end the situation, but since the city of Deng and the day of grievance, to the forced to give aid, the community on this matter, all to the hair, street talk Lane discussion, turned into talking about the information, today in the province Qing first good area of 14,000 yuan of the amount, special property frightening to hear, and the member Deng, deep know bad deeds Zhao, unable to cover up, is the situation of anxious intelligence, try to protect, remove Yin Xiaoyun, Zhang Zuojia Zhang Fengpian item name Fu Hall shareholders, and then instigated Zhang Fengpian, with the qualification of shop security, admitted to using remuneration of 14,000 yuan, so, the shareholders have people, bribes have been, recognized as seamless, remedy strategy, do not know that the witness is in, the facts Zhao, no matter how cunning exhibition, it is difficult to get rid of the responsibility, all Fushou Hall, the original Japanese shareholders, has been Deng Weicheng food responsibility proved, since there is no to ask, and according to Deng Weicheng concluded that the public security branch in the same burn, The letter contains Yin Yugui's handwritten letter, which is the most relevant, then called Zhang Tham as the heart, how hard, must top a share, that is, Qin's some important people, also admitted to top a share, although the letter has been burned, unable to verify, evidence with the newspaper writer and other correspondence, clues, not without collateral evidence, (attached to send a piece of nine pieces How about this kind of bribery, in fact, has long been exposed by the Blood Soul Assassination Group in the front, since it can not be regarded as a non-existent fact, that is, as the declaration said that a certain big counselor, a certain professor, a certain director, subject to the respective amounts, there is no excessive place, but the core of a certain fact, obviously refers to Zhang Zhixin and others, is in line with the facts of the case, before and after the printing, (attached to a declaration A) is that the members, even if not Fu Hall shareholders, and embezzlement of public funds of the fact, Qu is also difficult to deny, as for instigating Zhang Feng, admit to using the remuneration of one floor, especially without reason, set to Fengpian as a shareholder Ye, then Deng Weicheng no payment of , If for Fu Shou Tang is Ai Lai common, Zhang Feng no more than a shareholder, how can he alone enjoy it, such as for the remuneration of the store, then in the store security, in addition to Zhang Feng of Yong Maoquan, there is also a Yufeng Thick family, also no reason to let him swallow it alone, the capital of Yong Maoquan, but only 250 yuan, once guaranteed, there is 14,000 of the income, in reason, also not in line with, according to Zhang Fengbian concluded, the collected guarantee fee of 14,000 yuan, completely by the people alone, and did not enter the Yong Maoquan's book, the plot is bizarre, every unreasonable, for the collusion of false evidence, should be the people can know, on the evidence of Weicheng and Wu Gui Hall Fu Shou

Fushou Hall only need body shares, has obtained superior rights, and also subject to huge amounts of people's extra remuneration, fruit department equality signing, the world Ning has this buried, especially for Zhang Zhixin Yin Yugui and other official power, colluding with traitors, joint fraud of the iron evidence, the total inspection results, the Zhang Zhixin Yin Yugui Zhang Zuojia, etc., as senior officials, do not strive to be, for the service, but even colluding with contractors, from which to fish for profits, and then to communicate with false evidence, map disguise and other circumstances, especially the illegal extreme, and the public security first branch director Chai Jun, the party together to do evil, story prison , Should also be severely punished, to misuse the

<p>Jiading Pear Skin Causes Trouble Police Strike</p>
<p>At more than 5:00 p.m. on the 9th, Hu Xinggui, a shop assistant in the Yichangyong Towel Shop in front of the Pagoda in the city, discarded pear skin on the road. Chen Yangjie, a police trainee from the No. 26 post of the Zhouqiao Patrol, happened to be nearby. He saw the pear skin being thrown out and intervened with the shop. Hu immediately ordered an apprentice to pick it up. Officer Chen entered the shop and shouted accusations, and slapped the counter loudly. Zhu Quan, a shop assistant, protested, saying that slapping the counter was a taboo for merchants, and that the pear skin had already been picked up. Officer Chen immediately accused Zhu of being and detained Zhu. At that time, there were many who were tense in the street, and there was a lot of noise. During the disturbance, several window panes were broken. The shop immediately went up to the front door and stopped, and called the Public Security Bureau. The director (Chen Youmin) had been on leave for two weeks, and the clerk Zhu Cheng arrived at the scene, but had no solution, and immediately returned to the bureau. Since the above news came out, the crowd gathered in front of the tower with about a thousand people. There were four police trainees, including Zhuo Dengwen, in front of the pagoda, who were beaten. After being persuaded, they were led to Mingyuan Bathhouse to avoid the crowd. The county government heard the news and sent a security team to the scene, secretly deployed from Zhouqiao to Zhangma Lane, restricting pedestrians from standing. On the one hand, Captain Deng persuaded Officer Chen in the Yichangyong shop to return to the bureau. It was late at night, and the onlookers gradually dispersed. Outside the west gate, a police trainee was walking by the Diaoqiao pier, and a Taiyuan colleague Xu Xingsheng said that the police trainee was returning in disappointment, and was detained by the police and taken to the west gate branch. Patrol Chief Wang Cunhou reported to the county bureau, and the bureau ordered Xu to be sent to court. Hundreds of people went to the branch to inquire about the news. After mediation and bail, the crowd dispersed. The county public security office, believing that the police trainees had been beaten, sent five people, including Zhuo Dengwen, Chen Yangjie, Chen Zhiqiang, Liu Haiyi, and Huang Xiwu, to the county for examination of injuries that night. After the examination, Zhuo Dengwen was sent to Jiading Hospital for treatment. It was said that the injuries were still minor. The police trainees believed that they had a proper solution. On the 10th, all the police trainees inside and outside the city went on strike, and there were no police trainees stationed in the patrol posts.</p>

<p>Party and Government Handling of Zhenxin Workers' Unrest</p>
<p>Due to the accumulation of wages owed to employees by the Zhenxin Yarn Factory outside the west gate, a huge unrest occurred. Workers and staff members had repeatedly petitioned the county party headquarters, the county government, and the chamber of commerce. However, because the factory's associate managers Jiang Shiqing and Rong Xuxin were living in Shanghai to avoid the situation, and no one was in charge, there was no solution. On the morning of the 9th, more than 100 workers' representatives, including Wu Ada, Wu Borong, and Mi Fumei, petitioned the county government, requesting that the factory be ordered to resume work as soon as possible, and that the back wages and savings, etc., be paid off as soon as possible. At that time, County Magistrate Wang, together with Li Tiping, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Headquarters, and Qian Sunqing of the Chamber of Commerce, sent a quick letter to Jiang Zheqing, urging him to return to Wuxi immediately to take charge of the matter, so as to avoid the expansion of the unrest. Recently, Jiang's reply was received. Regarding the notice of suspension of work on August 1 and the resumption of work one month later, it was said that it had not been issued, but was posted by someone from the Party Headquarters and the Chamber of Commerce who guaranteed the cost, and there was no need for him to be responsible. Moreover, it pointed out that the unrest on July 31 was a case of gathering crowds, using violence, and coercion, and that if it was necessary to file a lawsuit in court, it would be easy to punish. It also requested that the handling methods for the suspension of work unrest in the Huafeng Flour Mill in Shanghai last month be followed. According to the letter, County Magistrate Wang and others, on the afternoon of the 10th, together with Party Committee Member Li Tiping, Sun Xiang, Xu Chizi, and Qian Sunqing of the Chamber of Commerce, etc., earnestly consulted at the Chamber of Commerce, believing that the factory's unrest had indeed expanded, and that if a quick solution was not used, there would never be a solution. According to the Company Law, for limited liability companies, all directors and supervisors should bear joint responsibility. After consultation, a strict solution was carried out. The county party headquarters also telegraphed the handling process to the central government and the two provincial regions yesterday, requesting clear instructions and hoping for a quick solution.</p>

The Dollar Steamship Line's ocean liner President Johnson, which came to Shanghai from Japan, was delayed by 36 hours due to taking shelter from the hurricane, and only entered port yesterday. Others who were delayed have all arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday. However, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haishang steamer suffered the most damage, with its cabin surfaces damaged by the hurricane in the Korean seas. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Loading Cargo in Korea</p>
<p>The Haishang steamer has a deadweight of 3,302 tons. It was previously leased to the government-run China Merchants Bureau to operate on the South China route.

On the afternoon of the 7th of this month, the ship was loading cargo in Korea and was about to set sail for Japan when it was hit by a hurricane.</p>
<p>Damage from the Storm</p>
<p>The Haishang steamer was anchored in Korean waters, right in the center of the hurricane. The violent winds and waves were like mountains falling and seas overturning. The four rooms on the cabin surface, where the chief and second engineers and other crew members lived, were all destroyed. The iron railings on the upper deck were also broken off by the hurricane. A lifeboat was also blown away by the strong winds and waves and swept into the sea, its whereabouts unknown. The large iron anchor at the front of the ship fell into the water due to the breaking of the iron chain. The perilous situation made people yesterday.</p>
<p>Report to Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the shipowner telegraphed Shanghai to report to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, saying that the front of the cabin surface was all destroyed, and the Gangway Spors were also damaged. Fortunately, the hull was not damaged, and the entire crew fought against the fierce winds and waves to avoid injuries. Upon receiving the news, the company, in addition to reporting the situation to the insurance company, immediately telegraphed back, ordering a detailed report of all the damage caused by the hurricane, and ordered the ship to sail to Japan to find a way to repair the damaged areas, replace the new anchor, rebuild the cabins, and add lifeboats, etc., in order to restore its sailing power.</p>

<p>Since its Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Lanshan, visited various countries in the Far East, the British Australian government has decided to set up commercial commissioners in China, Japan, and the Dutch East Indies respectively. Bowden, the commercial commissioner assigned to China, and his assistant commissioner, Lette, arrived in Shanghai by the "Nanking" yesterday and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. His commissioner's office is scheduled to be established in Shanghai. Bowden has lived in Shanghai for many years and is the general manager of A Cameron Compong, so he is very familiar with the commercial situation in China. Bowden told visiting reporters that the reason why the Australian government wants to set up a commercial commissioner in China is that it intends to develop Sino-Australian commerce and promote closer ties between the two countries. After taking office, he will do his best to make Sino-Australian relations closer and closer. It is also learned that its commercial commissioners stationed in Japan and the Dutch East Indies have also been assigned to Mr. Lauder, that is, Mr. Kregi Lai.</p>
<p>The "China Press" reported that Mr. Borden, the Australian Commercial Commissioner in China, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 9th after leaving Shanghai for six months, accompanied by Mr. Lutter, the Deputy Commercial Commissioner, on the Nanjing mail ship from Melbourne. Before taking up his current position, Mr. Borden had been doing business in Shanghai for many years, so he is familiar with the local business situation and has extensive contacts. In the future, he will travel to various commercial ports in China on a regular basis. According to Mr. Borden, the main purpose of the Australian government in appointing a commercial commissioner is to promote the sales of Australian products. His task includes collecting and disseminating information beneficial to this and to Australian merchants. Mr. Borden believes that good faith is an important factor if commercial ties are to develop to a satisfactory level. Therefore, he said that he will do his best to cultivate and expand the existing friendly relations between the Chinese and Australian business communities. During his recent visit to Australia, he traveled to several states and learned that Australian producers and merchants are very concerned about the expansion of commercial relations between China and Australia. All parties have promised to cooperate and assist, and the Australian government's Department of Commerce is particularly concerned about trade in the Far East. Australia's situation is getting better and better, the government's finances are very stable, and industry and commerce have made good progress. Australia's position today is far better than that of many other countries affected by the recession. He is willing to be in constant contact with those involved in the import trade of Australian products and will provide them with all possible information. Mr. Borden's current temporary residence is the Cathay Hotel, which will be used as an office until a suitable place is found.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Representative of Abyssinian Consulate in Japan Will Cross to Japan After Arriving in Shanghai to Talk with Chinese and Japanese Reporters <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, due to the recent disputes between Abyssinia and Italy, which are likely to lead to armed conflict, the Abyssinian Foreign Ministry has specially dispatched Dapi Paipi, the secretary of the former consulate in Osaka, Japan, to visit Japan. Mr. Dapi arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the French postal ship "Adus." At 9:15 am, the ship docked at the Zhaoshang Zhongzhan Wharf in Yangshupu. After his passport was checked, Mr. Dapi went to a hotel. As there are few official contacts between China and Abyssinia, the customs could have refused his entry, but he was allowed to stay due to special circumstances. Mr. Dapi plans to stay in Shanghai for two days and then take a ferry to Nagasaki. Yesterday morning, Chinese and Japanese reporters, concerned about the Abyssinian-Italian dispute, went to the wharf to inquire. Mr. Dapi, speaking fluent English to the reporters, said that the Abyssinian-Italian dispute is still ongoing. Although Italy has sophisticated troops and weapons, the Abyssinian people are waiting at ease, and due to climate and geographical conditions, Abyssinia can be assured of final victory. The Abyssinian King has already issued a national mobilization order and is making preparations. As for the rumors that he is going to Japan to visit officials and order munitions, this is a deliberate slander by the enemy. He originally worked at the consulate in Osaka and has been to Japan before. This trip to Japan is just a return to his post and will only go as far as Osaka, not Tokyo, and there will be no visit to Foreign Minister Hirota. Therefore, it can be said that his visit has no major mission.</p>
<p>Dapi Paipi (Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<p>Japanese Reports: The Japanese newspaper "Nippo" reported that Mr. Dapi Paipi, the Abyssinian envoy to Japan (honorary consul secretary), arrived in Shanghai on the French postal ship "Adus" at 10:00 am on the 10th, under the orders of Foreign Minister Hailu. He has reserved a room at the Fuxin Asia Hotel and plans to leave Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru on the 12th. He made the following statement to Japanese reporters: Question (Japanese reporters): Is the Abyssinian-Italian dispute definitively broken? What is Abyssinia's attitude towards the League of Nations? Answer (Mr. Dapi): The League of Nations is doing its best to mediate peacefully, and for the time being, war is unlikely to break out. We only believe in the League of Nations. If war unfortunately breaks out, Britain and France may step in to stop it. Question: If the Italian army is determined to attack, will your country fight back, and to what extent have you prepared for defense? Answer: The whole nation is prepared. Question: The climates of Abyssinia and Italy are different. I heard that the Italian army's war in Abyssinia is mostly unfavorable, is that true? Answer: Not only the climate but also the terrain is unfavorable. Question: Is the climate in Abyssinia hot? Answer: It is not hot, cooler than Shanghai, because Abyssinia is very high above sea level, 15,000 feet above sea level, with a very good climate, too cool at night. Question: Every step in Abyssinia is mountainous, is it impossible to attack with cannons? Answer: It is indeed impossible. Question: Does Abyssinia have many aircraft? Answer: Not many. Question: Do you have any special mission on your trip to Japan? Answer: This trip to Japan is originally for the purpose of exchanging envoys. There are some matters to discuss. I am an honorary consul secretary and will only go as far as Osaka and will not go to Tokyo for the time being. But I have to meet Foreign Minister Hirota, but the date has not yet been scheduled. I plan to stay in Japan for a long time. Question: Japan has shown goodwill towards Abyssinia. Does Abyssinia want to strengthen economic ties with Japan? Answer: Japanese-Abyssinian economic cooperation is one of the missions of my trip.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Banks Signed Loan Agreements for Flood Relief Yesterday, Loans to be Sent to Central Bank for Collection Before the 13th <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The 143,000 yuan in flood relief loans negotiated by the banks has been officially signed for loan agreements by the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces yesterday and sent to the Bankers Association for transfer. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Signing of Loan Agreements</p>
<p>The flood relief loans negotiated by the Bankers Association have been resolved by the 73rd Executive Committee meeting of the Association, dividing them into two types: (A) 10,000 yuan and (B) 5,000 yuan, and sent circulars to member banks to voluntarily lend, in order to raise 200,000 yuan. As of now, only 142,000 yuan has been pledged. In order to urgently provide disaster relief, the Bankers Association sent 28 loan agreements to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces for signing on the 6th. The Flood Relief Association has already signed all 28 loan agreements yesterday (the 10th) and returned them to the Bankers Association for distribution.</p>
<p>Scheduled Payment</p>
<p>The Bankers Association will transfer these officially signed loan agreements to the respective borrowing banks today, and according to the Flood Relief Association's reply, the Central Bank is designated as the agency for collecting these flood relief loans. Please send the amount of the loan to the Central Bank for collection before the 13th of this month, so that the Flood Relief Association can allocate it to various flood-stricken areas for urgent relief.</p>
<p>Interest at 7%</p>
<p>When the Bankers Association sent the 28 loan agreements to the Flood Relief Association, the interest rate was left blank for the Association to fill in. However, when the Flood Relief Association returned the loan agreements yesterday, it was still left blank. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association, inquired with the Flood Relief Association by telephone last night and learned that when the Central, China, and Communications Banks jointly provided a loan of 300,000 yuan, the interest rate was set at 7% per annum. The interest rate for the 143,000 yuan jointly loaned by the banks has also been decided to be handled in the same way. Therefore, before transferring the loan agreements to the banks today, the Bankers Association will fill in the words "7%" to inform them.</p>

<p>Declaration Announced</p>
<p>The declaration of the Second National Representatives Assembly of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Union, directly under the Ministry of Railways, states: The organization of the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Union began in the sixth year of the Republic of China after the Party launched the Northern Expedition. However, the unions at that time were horizontal organizations, such as those for train operations, machinery, catering, refreshments, loading, and unloading, each acting independently without any system. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Central People's Training Committee ordered the assignment of personnel to guide and reorganize them. In the eighteenth year, the Special Party Department of this route took over and continued the reorganization. In May of the twentieth year, the union's reorganization office was established. In September of the same year, the first national representative assembly was convened to elect directors and supervisors. Subsequently, while the registration was being processed, the "January 28th" Incident occurred, and the procedures could not be completed. Furthermore, the organization did not fully comply with current laws and regulations, and the matter was repeatedly delayed, and legal procedures were never completed. In November of last year, the Special Party Department of this route, in accordance with the Central Government's intentions and in compliance with laws and regulations, dispatched personnel to guide the entire day's management. After eight months of effort, the Second National Representatives Assembly was convened today. Recalling the founding of the union to this day, overcoming obstacles and experiencing difficulties, fortunately, both the Party and government have provided assistance, and all workers have supervised and urged each other, striving peacefully, and finally achieving success. The assembly is deeply gratified by this bright and promising future. However, future work involves numerous aspects, and the assembly has made practical decisions on the original plan. In particular, several points are revealed here as goals, and it is hoped that all workers will strive together: (1) Strengthen the organizational structure of the group. Only with healthy members can there be a healthy union. Workers must understand the meaning and application of the union, and especially need to truly recognize the relationship between themselves and the union, and cultivate the habit of group life. Under the guidance of the Chinese Kuomintang, standing at the forefront of the revolution, and being the backbone of the revolutionary movement; otherwise, if workers regard the union as irrelevant and indifferent, the power of the union will inevitably feel fragile, leading to the union becoming a ceremonial sacrifice, with only a shell remaining, the members scattered, and there will be no hope for their own liberation. Therefore, workers should regard the union as a second life and unanimously support its health. (2) Strive for production and construction. The country is facing difficult times and numerous problems. Railways are a national transportation enterprise. Workers who serve the railway are public officials of the country, sharing weal and woe, closely related. This is not only different from the distorted development of capitalism in Europe and the United States, where laborers are exploited, but also different from domestic labor-capital relations. The interests of our railway workers lie in the overall interests of the country. Striving for production and construction can only substantially improve the national economy and achieve the goal of benefiting both oneself and others. (3) Protect the interests of workers. Workers come to work on the railway and serve the country, which is also seeking a livelihood for themselves. The country treats workers without discrimination. Premier Sun has issued instructions to improve the living conditions of laborers. We ourselves see that there are still many areas where our current living conditions need to be improved. Legal demands are permitted by the national government. Forcibly seizing small gains is not what we desire, and cutting flesh to mend sores should be avoided. We should strive for self-help. The protection of workers' interests has always been the focus of railway authorities, and the union should apply on behalf of workers for legitimate and reasonable appeals. (4) Conduct welfare undertakings. The purpose of the union is to seek the interests of workers. Various welfare undertakings will be gradually established to the extent of available manpower and financial resources. The union's constitution and regulations stipulate: 1. Investigating and surveying the living conditions of members. 2. Representing workers in making suggestions and requests to railway authorities and higher-level agencies. 3. Establishing worker life insurance organizations. 4. Organizing worker literacy night schools, worker children's schools, and other labor education. 5. Establishing libraries and newspaper reading rooms. 6. Printing publications. 7. Organizing various cooperative societies such as production, consumption, purchasing, credit, and housing. 8. Holding various lectures, research conferences, and fellowship meetings. 9. Providing clubhouses and other entertainment facilities. 10. Establishing sports fields. 11. Providing relief for unemployment, illness, and death of members. These are the major welfare projects. Although they cannot be achieved immediately, they must be weighed according to urgency and gradually implemented. It is hoped that all workers will pool their wisdom and efforts to achieve them together. (5) Promote the Three Principles of the People. The way out for the Chinese nation requires the practical implementation of the Three Principles of the People. We must unite under the theories and strategies of the Three Principles of the People with the spirit of saving the country and the people, in order to achieve the independent survival of the entire nation, build the political order of the entire nation, and develop the economic undertakings of the entire nation, striving forward and never changing. The Communist Party and all counter-revolutionary forces are absolutely not allowed to have any room for activity on this route. This is the common responsibility of all our workers. Although this assembly has only lasted for a few days, the above-mentioned key points and principles have been established. It is hoped that all our workers will work together to achieve them. This declaration is hereby made.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Shanghai National Medicine Branch Association Board of Directors Established; Opening Ceremony Held Last Sunday <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Branch Association Board of Directors, since Shen Zhongfang was appointed by the Central National Medicine Museum as chairman, Chu Rongchuan, Yu Zhongqi, Cai Jiping, and Ye Chunqiao as standing directors, and Lu Zhenqing, Xie Liheng, Bao Chengliang, Tu Shichu, Shen Qiangfu, Jin Guoli, Xu Zisheng, and thirty others as directors, Chairman Shen has selected September 8th (Sunday) to hold the inauguration ceremony at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Association. The Central National Medicine Museum specially requested the Shanghai City Party Committee member Tao Baichuan to attend and supervise the oath-taking. Twenty-eight directors attended on that day, and Director Xia, Deputy Directors Ding and Gu were also present. Chairman Shen presided over the meeting, and Wu Jingqing served as the recorder. The meeting began at 3:00 PM. After the formalities, (1) The chairman delivered an opening speech, saying that today is the day of the establishment of the board of directors of the branch association. It is an honor to have everyone present to provide guidance. Since the establishment of this branch association, it has been suspended for several years due to various reasons. This association has also been suspended accordingly. Now that it has been ordered to resume, this association is also revived at the same time, and the prosperous scene is like the sun rising in the sky. However, at the beginning of development, it is not easy to set things up. This association must use all its strength to strive, without complacency, without fear of difficulties, and take a unique path to create a place of excellence. Remembering that our national medicine is profound and mysterious, reaching the extreme. Those who are not talented and ambitious cannot exhaust its source and end. Since ancient times, there have been sages, but today, our national medicine is facing a precarious situation, with a danger of imminent collapse. Letting the Yanhuang unique knowledge decline, this association is anxious day and night, thinking about how to remedy it. In terms of medicine, the gains and losses, reforms and innovations, are each handled as appropriate, but not deviating from the path of impartiality. All comrades in the medical and pharmaceutical fields should be mindful of the friendship of being in the same boat and not be conceited. Do not allow each to express opinions and try to remedy things partially. For medicine, improve it at any time, vigorously promote it, and do not be lazy or wasteful. We know that the future of national medicine and pharmaceuticals will have a solemn and brilliant day. Isn't there a great hope? Comrades in the medical and pharmaceutical fields, let us work together. (2) All directors took the oath of office. (3) Central National Medicine Museum Representative Tao Baichuan gave a training speech, stating that national medicine and pharmaceuticals have now reached a critical period. If we want to reverse this misfortune, in addition to everyone working together, we must also adopt the spirit of science. The spirit of science is to seek the truth. We should explore true knowledge and insights, investigate things and extend knowledge, and should not think that we have inherited clothing and follow old ways, making our national medicine and pharmaceuticals, which have lasted for many years, gradually lose their authenticity. Now the central government pays great attention to national medicine and pharmaceuticals, and the directors who are inaugurated today are the elites of the national medicine and pharmaceutical fields. It is hoped that everyone will instill new knowledge with the spirit of science, cultivate new talents, and carry forward the unique essence of our country. This is a bit of my opinion to everyone. (4) Director Xia and Deputy Director Ding gave speeches (brief). (5) The chairman gave a reply. (6) Photography. (7) Adjournment. The first meeting of the board of directors was then held, and the resolutions are recorded below: (1) Director Xia requested a review of the budget for the 24th year. Resolution: After the budget for the 14th year is mimeographed and distributed to the directors for detailed review, it will be submitted to the previous board of directors for a public decision. (2) The Standing Committee of the Board of Directors proposed how to plan for the regular and temporary expenses of the branch association. Resolution: Passed as is. Handed over to the Standing Committee of the Board of Directors to organize the text. (3) The Standing Committee of the Board of Directors proposed to set up a National Medical Society as ordered. Resolution: Handed over to the Standing Committee of the Board of Directors to formulate specific measures before submitting it to the meeting for discussion again. (Note) Chairman Shen donated 3,000 yuan on the spot for start-up costs, and preparations will begin as soon as the regular expenses are raised. (4) The Standing Committee of the Board of Directors proposed specific measures for the branch association to appraise cases sent to the court for litigation, so as to handle them carefully. Resolution: Passed as is. Submitted to the Central National Medicine Museum for record, and sent to the National Medicine Branch Association for reference.</p>

<p>After eleven refugees from Belgium, including Lin Dipu, arrived in Shanghai, they were taken care of by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and temporarily resided at the Dongfang Hotel in Xiaodongmen. It is learned that among the refugees returning this time, there are two students, Liu Weifan and Jiang Gujie, who took a train to Beijing yesterday morning, so those remaining in Shanghai numbered only twenty-nine. The refugees, having been away from their homeland for many years, feel very unfamiliar with all business information. Now that they have returned from a foreign country, they have suddenly encountered the pain of unemployment. Therefore, they sent the spokesperson Yao Dipu to plead with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, requesting that they seek ways to provide relief. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, considering this matter to be of great importance, telegraphed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing for instructions and sent Liu Zhuchu and Hou Can to the Dongfang Hotel to comfort them and handle registration procedures. According to Liu Zhuchu, who spoke to the reporter of the Industrial Society, the number of refugees returning to the country this time is large, and the Overseas Chinese Village is limited in the number of people it can accommodate, so they can only be temporarily sent back to their hometowns and notified after a solution is found. Regarding relief, the bureau will handle it jointly with the Public Security Bureau. It is reported that the refugees' temporary meals are still unsettled, and it is urgently hoped that the authorities will provide relief quickly.</p>

<p>Liu Asi (also known as Wang Asi) from the north held a counterfeit two-jiao subsidiary currency note from the Central Bank the other day and bought a bowl of wonton soup from a stall vendor in front of No. 43 Lanwei Ai Road in the French Concession, worth 40 wen, and asked the stall vendor to give him change with the counterfeit note. The stall vendor did not know it was counterfeit and gave him 64 copper coins. After going to another stall, he went to a shop to buy something, and found that the note was fake. The next day, Liu continued to use the same counterfeit note, and was reported by the stall vendor and arrested. He was taken to the police station, and two counterfeit Central Bank subsidiary currency notes and two counterfeit tickets from the Shennan Bank worth one yuan were found on his person. His fingerprints were also examined, and it was found that he was a repeat offender. According to the confession obtained by the police chief, he was 51 years old and bought the counterfeit notes from Zhang Haiqing, who lived on the upper floor of the cross-street building at No. 160 Haichao Road outside the Dananmen, paying eight jiao for sixteen counterfeit notes. The police officer Wang Yucheng was dispatched to Haichao Road No. 164 to make the arrest, but Zhang had already left. Later, twenty-two counterfeit Central Bank two-jiao currency notes (all new notes) were found in the partition wall of the cross-street building and brought back to the police station for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Post Office Robbery Case: Police Actively Pursuing the Culprits; Patrol Teams Dispatched for Strict Inspection; Post Office Resolves to Transport Funds as Usual with Enhanced Security; Banks and Money Shops Enhance Security Measures <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the robbery of a huge sum of 91,900 yuan from the Shanghai Postal Administration the day before yesterday morning shocked the entire Shanghai. A Dagong News Agency reporter learned yesterday morning that the police authorities in Shanghai and the concessions are paying close attention to this matter and have already begun investigations. At the same time, the Deputy Postmaster-General Tao Gongchen also visited Cai Jingjun, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, yesterday to request a thorough investigation. The bureau will strengthen security at the post office. The banks and money shops in the public concession, learning from the previous incident, have also increased security forces and tightened precautions starting yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Banks and Money Shops Intensify Security Last Night and Today</p>
<p>Since the post office robbery, the banking and financial industries in the city have been on alert. With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching and financial transactions becoming more frequent, the need to increase security has become even more apparent. Therefore, starting yesterday, additional police officers were dispatched to guard key areas and enhance security at banks on the Bund in the public concession, including the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Mercantile Bank, HSBC, American International Assurance (AIA), Bank of Taiwan, Yokohama Specie Bank, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, Citibank, and the preparation vaults of the Zhongnan Bank and the Four Banks on Sichuan Road, as well as various money shops like Fuyuan on Ningbo Road, and various branches of Shanghai Bank, Guohua Bank, Xinhua Bank, Shanghai City Bank, Hengli Bank, Dazhong Bank, Bank of China, Farmers and Workers Bank of China, and the Four Provinces Farmers Bank. This is to prevent any unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>Post Office Transports Funds as Usual Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Despite the robbery, the post office transported funds as usual yesterday morning. This is a necessary public service and should not be abandoned for fear of choking. However, security has been increased. The Public Security Bureau originally planned to station two squads of police officers at the post office, each with nine men, totaling eighteen, led by one inspector and two sergeants. They are now paying special attention. The Public Security Bureau has decided to add more police officers to guard the bureau. The concession police have also dispatched additional officers to guard outside the post office and in the vicinity to prevent the recurrence of such unfortunate events. At the same time, the post office is said to have made the fund transport procedures even more thorough.</p>
<p>Deputy Postmaster General Visits Cai to Urge Arrest of Thieves</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Postal Administration dispatched Deputy Postmaster-General Tao Gongchen and Postal Inspector Huang Shihua to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to visit Director Cai Jingjun, requesting a thorough investigation and the early capture of the fleeing bandits to solve the case as soon as possible. As Cai was busy with important matters, the Secretary-General Su Liping received them. Tao Gongchen reported the circumstances of the robbery and the true appearance of the bandits. Su promised to order his subordinates to rigorously pursue the arrest and ensure a quick resolution of the case.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau to Increase Security</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Dagong News Agency visited Su Liping, Secretary of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to inquire about his views on the postal administration robbery case. Su stated that the security at the post office was the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau, which had stationed one police officer, two sergeants, and over ten police officers inside the bureau for daily security. The area outside the bureau was under the jurisdiction of the concession authorities, so the investigation and arrest were quite complicated. The Public Security Bureau is paying close attention to the case and has ordered the investigation team of the Inspection Department and the police stations in each district to be fully vigilant to ensure a quick resolution. As for the future security of the post office, additional police officers will be dispatched and strict security measures will be implemented. Employees of the bureau must have badges and wear uniforms, restricting the arbitrary entry and exit of other personnel to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.</p>
<p>Injured Bodyguards Still in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Of the three bodyguards and one senior clerk injured in the robbery, Lü Ruilin and Yuan Bingshu have died. Zhou Yucheng is still being treated at Tongren Hospital. According to the hospital's examination yesterday morning, his injuries have slightly improved, but he is still unable to speak. News last night indicated that Zhou's temperature was 101 degrees and his pulse was 147 beats per minute. His stomach injuries are severe, and recovery is unlikely. The public concession also organized patrol teams yesterday to patrol various districts of the concession. Anyone with suspicious behavior will be searched immediately.</p>
<p>Five Suspects Detained in Huazhuang</p>
<p>News from the Post Office last night stated that after the robbery, reports were sent to various counties near Shanghai. Local public security authorities immediately began investigations. It is said that five suspects have been detained near Xinzhuang, Songjiang County. As no conclusive evidence has been found, they are still under strict investigation.</p>
<p>Talks from a Certain Police Expert</p>
<p>According to another source, our reporter made a special trip to visit a certain gentleman who has long been in the police force and has rich investigative experience, asking about the circumstances of the case and how to investigate it. He replied as follows (the following are the gentleman's words): This case is rare in Shanghai, but it is common in Europe and the United States. However, according to my personal perspective, after review, the bandits must have received considerable training. Their grand plan and meticulous prior arrangements will be understood by anyone with a little detective knowledge. The bandits' careful consideration and thorough investigation beforehand could not have been done without considerable time. The most noteworthy aspect of this case is that the firearms used by the bandits numbered six or seven, all of which were of the same type. This is not something that ordinary bandits can accomplish. Furthermore, based on the habits of ordinary bandits during robberies, their purpose is usually only money. They have no deep-seated grudges against the victims, so they are never willing to shoot people unless absolutely necessary. In superstitious terms, bandits consider harming the victims an absolute taboo. Examining the circumstances of this robbery, when the senior clerk Yuan Bingshu saw the two bandits approaching, he simply turned to avoid them, but one of the bandits suddenly opened fire. At that time, the two bandits were close, and Yuan could not have escaped with a simple wave of the hand. As for the two guards, Lü Ruilin and Zhou Yucheng, when they heard the gunfire, they saw the two bandits fleeing with the loot and wanted to draw their guns to pursue them. However, the two accomplices ambushing beside the silver transport vehicle fired two shots simultaneously, and Lü and Zhou were killed and injured at the same time. If they were ordinary bandits, they could have disarmed Lü and Zhou, driven them into a corner, and then escaped leisurely. Why did they have to kill Yuan and Lü? In summary, the bandits were not only well-trained but also had a large organization.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications to Provide Generous Compensation to the Deceased</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: Regarding the postal administration robbery, the Postal General Administration has forwarded the matter to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications. The Postal General Administration has decided to provide generous compensation to the guards and staff who died in the line of duty.</p>

<p>Wang Baosheng, a native of Changxing and the business director of the Hangzhou branch of the Changxing Coal Mine, has a daughter named Fadi, 14 years old. She was betrothed to a Hang family in Meixi Town, Huzhou as a child bride. In April of this year, Wang entrusted his neighbor Gao Jinshi to send her to the Hang family. However, Gao actually brought her to Shanghai and sold her to Han Alai, a woman who runs a brothel at No. 5 Hongxingli, Beijing Road. Thus, Wang Fadi fell into a fiery pit, while her parents were completely unaware. Recently, Wang's daughter, unable to bear the suffering of her flesh trade, entrusted a client to send a letter to her parents. Wang Baosheng, after receiving the letter, learned the truth and reported the matter to the Changxing County Court, which arrested Gao Jinshi. At the same time, the court sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Court requesting assistance in arresting the madam Han. The Special Court approved the request, issued an arrest warrant, and sent it to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Pang Ruiqing came to arrest Han, but she was not there. Only Wang Fadi was rescued and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Wang's daughter was brought to the Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer Chen Ming stated the case and requested instructions on how to handle Wang's daughter. Subsequently, Wang Baosheng surrendered himself, requesting permission to take his daughter back. Judge Qian Hongye, after reviewing the official letter from the Changxing Court, ordered that Wang Fadi be handed over to her father and ordered the police to rigorously pursue Han Alai and bring her to justice.</p>

<p>Yu Niusheng, the owner of the Yutai Liang Paper Shop at No. 22 Sanpailou in the city, at about 11:00 AM on the 9th, packed 600 yuan in cash and 481.85 yuan in checks, totaling 1081.85 yuan, into a paper package. He instructed his apprentice Wang Liansheng (18 years old, from Hangzhou) to take a deposit book and send it to the Guohua Bank branch at the intersection of Miniti Avenue and Rue Wagner for deposit. Wang put the checks in his pocket and held the package of cash in his hand. While passing the entrance of Yuqingli on Rue de Montauban in the French Concession, four bandits suddenly saw him, rushed up, and blocked his way. They pointed at the paper package in Wang's hand, claiming it was opium, and forcibly snatched it without explanation. They opened the package and, seeing that it contained cash, re-wrapped it and fled south in a rush. Wang chased after them, blowing his whistle and shouting "Robbery!" Wang identified the robber holding the package and chased him to the intersection of the French Avenue and West Xin Bridge. There, Officer No. 282 on guard intercepted the robber, and the stolen goods were recovered intact. However, the other three accomplices had scattered and escaped. The officer took the robber to the Grand Bell Police Station. Under interrogation, the robber confessed his name was Chen Afang, 29 years old, from Ningbo. He said that the robbery was the idea of Dan Atai (25 years old, from Shaoxing), who was still at large. Dan was waiting at the intersection of Ningbo Road and West Xin Bridge. Detective Yang then took Chen to arrest Dan and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Judge Zhang Chaozuo questioned the lawyer Fei Xizhen from the police, who stated that the defendants were involved in a robbery case and that the police still needed to investigate and arrest the accomplices at large, requesting a postponement of the trial. The plaintiff, Wang Liansheng, then testified about the robbery. Chen and Dan confessed to instigating the robbery without denying it. The court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and granted a postponement of the trial. As for the 600 yuan of stolen money, the victim was allowed to reclaim it. Furthermore, the accomplice Bao Liren (nicknamed "Little One Treasure") was also arrested yesterday morning by Detectives Chen Jiuxiang and Li Baochang and is awaiting transfer to the court today for a joint investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Continuous High Tides in the City Tomorrow Morning; Huangpu Bureau Announces <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>According to the Huangpu Bureau Tidal Prediction, the city will experience continuous high tides for six days starting at 11:35 AM tomorrow, lasting until the 17th, after which they will subside slightly. The highest peak will be at 11:57 AM on the 13th, reaching a height of 12 feet and 5 inches. The maritime sector is prepared, and all warehouses have been secured with gates. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Prediction of Continuous High Tide Levels</p>
<p>According to the Huangpu Bureau's predictions, the high tide levels for the next six days are as follows: 12th (all calculations based on the time of the highest tide) 11:00 AM no record, 11:37 PM 10 feet 55 inches; 13th 11:57 AM 12 feet 5 inches, 11 feet 35 inches in the afternoon (time not specified); 14th 12:03 AM 12 feet 48 inches, 12:23 PM 11 feet 45 inches; 15th 12:49 AM 12 feet, 1:19 PM 11 feet 25 inches; 16th 1:36 AM 11 feet 5 inches, 2:06 PM 11 feet 22 inches; 17th 2:25 AM 11 feet 07 inches, 2:50 PM 10 feet 75 inches. After that, the tides will gradually recede.</p>
<p>Highest Tide on the Day After Tomorrow; Twelve and a Half Feet</p>
<p>Of the six days of high tides, the highest will occur the day after tomorrow (the 13th). One tide is predicted to start rising at 10:47 AM, reaching its peak at 11:57 AM, and reaching its highest point at 12:12 PM, with a predicted level of 12 feet 5 inches. In the afternoon, it will start rising at 10:57 PM and reach its highest point at 12:22 PM, reaching 11 feet 35 inches. It is understood that the reason is that it is the second day of the lunar month and the 16th day of the eighth month, which is the period of the spring tide, so the levels are particularly high, more severe than usual.</p>
<p>Warehouses Have Strengthened Precautions</p>
<p>It is understood that warehouses in the lowest-lying areas, such as near the Zhejiang Industrial Bank warehouse on North Suzhou Road, next to the Yong'an Department Store on Nanjing Road, the Shanghai Telephone Company Central Patrol Station on Jiangxi Road, the Four Banks Savings Society on Hankou Road and Sichuan Road, and in the French Concession, have taken precautions, so there is no risk of flooding during the high tide period.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Corpse of Murdered Woman Found in Xiaohama, West Shanghai <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The corpse of a woman was found this morning in the Xiaohama area at the south end of the Huning Road Railway in West Shanghai. A crowd of onlookers gathered. The Outer Sun Hui Bridge Police Station instructed local Bao Gu Xueyuan to report to the local court for an inspection. After receiving the report, the court appointed Prosecutor Xiao Jinying and Inspector Xuan Zhiming to go to the scene. The corpse was identified as a woman about 30 years old, with hair that had not yet been cut. She was wearing a blue foreign cloth short shirt and pants, brown thread socks, small black shoes, and resembled a woman from the Hakka region. Her forehead, temples, throat, and right chest were all stabbed with knives. The two wounds on her back were the most severe, penetrating deep into her internal organs. She had a total of five stab wounds. There was also a knife wound on the tiger's mouth of her left hand, presumably from using her hand to block the attack during the murder, resulting in the injury. It was determined that the stab wounds were fatal. The coroner completed the report. As there were no family members to identify the body, photos were taken, a coffin was purchased, and the body was prepared for burial, pending the arrest of the murderer. The corpse was murdered and dumped in the river. The river was shallow, so the body was discovered immediately. The reason for the murder is unknown, and opinions vary. The corpse was found with a strip of riding cloth tied to the lower body, suggesting that the red tide had arrived. The police station has ordered detectives to secretly investigate the murderer to bring the truth to light.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Creditor Affixes Public Notice; Two Lawyers Consider It Defamatory <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Lao He Tai Restaurant in the Lujiazhai area of Pudong stopped business at the end of April due to poor sales and announced its liquidation. On May 1st, it engaged lawyers Wen Huan and Shan Yinghui to handle the liquidation. In addition to publishing a notice in the newspaper, they also posted a notice on the restaurant's signboard. Unexpectedly, a creditor added another notice on the signboard, accusing the lawyers of colluding with the debtor to secretly return the restaurant's assets. After investigation, the lawyers Shan and Ying determined that the notice was posted by Zhang Jintao, the owner of the Xiangshun Fresh Meat Shop, and Ye Hengshao, the owner of the Fang Xintai Fresh Meat Shop, who were creditors of the restaurant. They believed that Zhang and Ye were intentionally defaming them and jointly filed a private prosecution with the criminal court of the local court. The case was once summoned for trial but was not concluded. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Judge Tan Zhuohong specially convened the Eleventh Court to continue the trial. The defendants Zhang Jintao and Ye Hengshao also engaged lawyers to file a counterclaim, stating that the counter-claimants were law-abiding merchants who had been groundlessly accused, causing them great mental and reputational damage. They argued that the plaintiffs knew that the counter-claimants were not involved in the case and forcibly dragged them in, thinking that merchants were afraid of trouble and that they could easily achieve their goals. They argued that the plaintiffs intentionally caused the counter-claimants to be subjected to criminal punishment and should be punished for false accusation according to law. After the judge took the stand, the first witness, Wang Chuwen, 31 years old, from Jiaxing, who worked in the Pudong Fire Brigade, testified that he did not know who posted the notice on the Lao He Tai signboard. Shan Yinghui said that on July 3rd, the plaintiffs came to the fire brigade to inquire about the truth of the notice. Wang Chuwen replied that since the notice had already identified Zhang and Ye as the perpetrators, he did not need to explain further. From this, it can be seen that the two defendants' defamation of the plaintiffs was undeniable. As for the counterclaim of false accusation, it could not be established according to law. Shan Yinghui's testimony was the same as above. Zhang Jintao and Ye Hengshao denied posting the notice. After hearing the testimony, the judge ordered the start of the debate. After the case was clarified, it was deemed concluded and scheduled for sentencing at 10:00 AM on the 17th. The defendants were returned to their original bail pending further instructions.</p>

<p>Recently, the Customs Water Police have frequently uncovered cases of human trafficking of women and children for export on various sea vessels. Therefore, inspections have been strictly enforced. Yesterday at 11:00 AM, as the Hong Kong-bound Songshan Maru ship of the Nisshin Company from the Pudong Lao Baidu was about to set sail, detectives Cheng Yongnian, Qu Hekui, Li Wenqi, Zhou Zenghua, and others were dispatched, along with Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the Women and Children Relief Association, to board the ship for inspection. While patrolling the steerage, they noticed two elderly women, one speaking with a Suzhou accent and the other with a Jiangbei accent, accompanied by three boys under the age of ten. The three boys were dressed uniformly in white Western-style shirts and yellow shorts, wearing rubber sneakers, resembling children from wealthy families. However, the eyes of the two elderly women shifted restlessly, looking around nervously, easily arousing the suspicion of the detectives. The detectives separated the adults from the children for interrogation. The Jiangbei elderly woman claimed the two older children were her own, while the Suzhou elderly woman claimed the youngest child was her godson. However, when the three children were questioned, they all said they did not know the two elderly women. Thus, the deception was exposed, and they were all taken to the police station. According to the Suzhou elderly woman's statement, her name was Zhang Yuan, 51 years old, and she did not know the Jiangbei elderly woman. A friend sold her the youngest child for 38 yuan to be her godson. The child arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and stayed in a hotel for two nights, planning to go to Hong Kong by ship this morning. According to the Jiangbei elderly woman's statement, her name was Zhang, 42 years old, from Huaicheng. She had worked as a servant for Xiao Ajin in a theater troupe in Changzhou for three years. Now that her employment contract has expired, she met Zhang Yuan (the first defendant) in the Suzhou theater. Yuan was willing to hire her as a servant, agreeing on a monthly salary of seven yuan, and told her to treat the two older children as her own sons. Yesterday at midnight, she followed Yuan, taking the three children on a night train, arriving in Shanghai at 5:00 AM this morning. She took the two older children by car to the Nanshi dock and then hired a boat to cross to the Pudong ship. Yuan took the youngest child by rickshaw and boarded the ship at 8:00 AM this morning, which is the truth. The detectives then interrogated the three children separately. The oldest child, named Wei Changsheng, nine years old, from Taizhou, said his father's name was Desheng, who used to be a soldier in the army and is now retired, making a living pulling a rickshaw in Suzhou. A few days ago, while playing on a bridge in Suzhou, he met the second defendant, Tang, who lured him to her house under the pretext of buying candy, and saw the first defendant, Yuan, also there. According to the second child's statement, his name was Shi Jinhai, eight years old, his father's name was Xuekang, who pulled a rickshaw for Mr. Chen, a comprador in the China Merchants Bureau, and lived at No. 6, Lane 36 of the Red Cross Society on Xieqiao. Twenty days ago, while playing outside, he met a strange man who offered to buy him watermelon, so he followed him. That night, he was taken to the train and went to Suzhou, to Yuan's house, and stayed for several days, only arriving in Shanghai this morning. According to the youngest child, named Abing, six years old, from Suzhou, when asked further, he stared blankly and could not answer. Probably due to his young age, he claimed not to know his parents' names. The police chief noted that Tang claimed to have come to Shanghai on the night train last night, while Yuan said she had been in Shanghai for two days, so he asked Yuan which hotel she was staying at. Yuan hesitated and evaded the question, claiming she had forgotten. Attempting to shirk responsibility, the police chief, seeing that the case was clear, sent officers to Xieqiao to investigate Shi's family. Only Shi's mother, Wu, was found, and she was overjoyed. A woman surnamed, a neighbor at number five, whose son had disappeared at the same time as Shi, accompanied Wu to the police station for identification. Shi recognized his biological mother and hugged her, crying loudly. Wu said her son had disappeared on the 21st of last month, and she had been searching for him for more than 20 days. She was also overjoyed and wept. The neighbor, seeing that her son was not among the three children, also fell to the ground and cried bitterly. The police chief, considering that the two kidnappers had separated family members, which was truly inhuman, decided to hand the three children over to the Relief Association for overnight care, and send them to the court for a decision this morning. The two kidnappers were also detained and will be sent to the court for questioning this morning. Meanwhile, the detectives are ordered to strictly investigate the accomplices and trace the other missing boy.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Fei Junwen Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment for Robbing the Ancestral Tablet and Obstructing the Funeral, Suspended for Two Years <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Fei Keming, a local real estate owner, possessed assets worth two to three hundred thousand. Fei died of illness on August 4th this year. The family property was not divided, and the funeral affairs were entirely managed by the eldest son, Yusheng, leading to dissatisfaction from the second son, Junwen, resulting in the incident of robbing the ancestral tablet. Yusheng reported this to the Huishan Police Station, and Fei Junwen was detained and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. Details of this were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng of the First Special Court continued the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police lawyer, stated that since the defendant Fei Junwen was reprimanded by the court last time and ordered to be released on bail, he did not cause any obstruction during the funeral. However, his wife, Wang, reported to the police station on the 7th of this month (the day of the funeral), claiming that she was beaten and injured by the plaintiff Fei Yusheng. The police station is currently investigating. Fei Meiwen, the defendant's brother, also reported to the police station, claiming that a wooden box in the house, containing deeds and other items left by their father, had disappeared. He requested that this be recorded. In summary, these are all family disputes. However, the plaintiff now states that he does not wish to pursue the matter. But the article of indictment by the police station is Article 246, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of obstructing a funeral, which is not subject to prosecution only upon complaint. Therefore, the police station does not agree to withdraw the complaint and requests that the law be enforced. Fei Yusheng then stated that the ancestral tablet of his late father had been handed over by his sister, Meijin, and had been mediated by relatives and friends, so he did not wish to pursue the matter further. When questioned, the defendant Fei Junwen denied taking the ancestral tablet and strongly criticized his brother for monopolizing the funeral affairs and the absurdity of the obituary. The court, seeing that the facts were clear, ordered the debate to begin. After the police lawyer and the defendant's lawyer, Xie Chuanding, argued, Judge Huang announced the verdict in court: Fei Junwen is sentenced to two months of imprisonment for obstructing the funeral, suspended for two years.</p>

<p>Jiang Futian, an inspector from the French Concession Police, detectives Wang Rusong and Zhang Daorong, and officer Liu Jinrong, uncovered an illegal coin smelting operation at Lane 117, Pushi Road, on the 14th of last month. They arrested workers Yu Qijin, Ji Heshang, Xie Laichao, Li Heshang, Zhao Ajin, Liu Are, Wen Guoan, Wang Qingzhang, Zhou Shichao, Li Arong, Han Azhang, Chen Jianchu, Han Asheng, Yang Renchuan, and fourteen others at the scene.

They also arrested Li Guoliang, the brother of the main offender Li Guoxiang (who is at large), accountant Ni Runzhen, and sixteen others in Zhabei. The main offenders Li Guoxiang, Zhao Bingzhang, and Zhang Hairong fled upon hearing the news. The police transferred the above defendants to the Second Special Court, and the prosecution was initiated based on Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations on Obstructing National Currency Politics. Judge Li Changnian held several hearings. The defendants all consistently denied smelting silver coins, claiming they bought miscellaneous silver, melted it, and sold it to the Central Bank. After the trial was declared concluded, Judge Li arrived at the First Criminal Court at 9:30 AM yesterday and ordered all the defendants to be brought to the case. He announced the verdict: Ni Runzhen and Li Guoliang, for assisting in the intention of profiting and destroying silver coins, are each sentenced to six months of imprisonment; Yu Qijin, Han Azhang, Chen Jianchu, and Han Asheng (same charge as above) are each sentenced to three months of imprisonment; Ji Heshang, Xie Laichao, Zhao Ajin, Yang Renchuan, Liu Are, Zhou Guoan, and Zhou Shichao (same charge as above) are each sentenced to three months of imprisonment, each suspended for one year; Ji Heshang, Wang Qingzhang, and Li Miaofa are found not guilty and acquitted.

<h3 id="e126">Large-Scale Public Demonstration of Natural Fire Extinguishing Grenades Held the Day Before Yesterday; Science is Omnipotent and Benefits Humanity; A Major Transformation in Firefighting History <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the public has paid increasing attention to safety equipment, and firefighting has also been improving day by day. Recently, Dazhong Trading Company, located on the fifth floor of the Continental Department Store on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, has produced a new type of natural fire extinguishing grenade. It is powerful, easy to use, beautiful in design, and reasonably priced, truly a beacon of hope for the future of firefighting. Because the company is newly established, to gain the trust of all sectors, it has held public demonstrations in various cities at home and abroad. The day before yesterday at 4:00 PM, a large-scale public demonstration was held at the public sports field in Nanshi. Those who went to visit were like ten thousand people emptying their homes, and the scene was extremely enthusiastic. The performance results were also excellent, and the audience was amazed. The details of the demonstration are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrangement inside the venue: At the entrance of the public sports field, a bamboo cloth banner with the words "Demonstration of Natural Fire Extinguishing Grenades Produced by Dazhong Company" was hung. Both sides of the aisle were full of slogans. In the center of the field stood a wooden shed, 12 feet wide and 14 feet high, divided into two compartments in the middle. In front of the shed were flammable materials such as firewood and kerosene. Fire extinguishing grenades were displayed inside the shed, and a purchase counter was set up. From the start of the demonstration, there was a half-price sale for two hours, entirely for promotional purposes. Therefore, those who went to purchase at that time were extremely eager.</p>
<p>Report on the demonstration: At 4:00 PM, the demonstration began. Wang Yuantong, the director of the company, gave a report, saying, "Thank you all for attending today. The natural fire extinguishing grenade produced by our company is a new product in China. To gain the trust of all sectors, we have held public demonstrations in various cities at home and abroad, all with remarkable results. Today, we are holding a larger-scale public demonstration to show the actual effect."</p>
<p>Demonstration situation: After the report, firewood and kerosene were put into the two compartments, and fires were lit simultaneously. In less than a quarter of an hour, a huge fire appeared, and thick smoke filled the sky. Then, Yuan Qirui, an employee of the company, held a grenade and threw it into the wooden shed. In less than half a minute, with a sudden sound, the fires in both compartments were extinguished simultaneously. The audience applauded like thunder, and everyone was amazed. Afterwards, another demonstration was held, which was also very effective. After the demonstration, the person in charge of the company invited all sectors to gather in the reception room and reported everything.</p>
<p>Manufacturing overview: According to the person in charge of the company, the natural fire extinguishing grenade was invented by the German Mr. Blanc in 1934. Through an introduction, the company signed a contract with the German factory to set up a self-manufacturing facility in China. The grenade is made of various chemical substances combined into a colorless transparent liquid, which is scientifically filled into a colorless glass bottle that is not affected by changes. The bottle is six inches high and eleven inches in circumference, shaped like an elongated circle, containing chemical liquid, weighing about one pound. The company has now begun large-scale production because all sectors are purchasing them.</p>
<p>Features of the grenade: The features of the natural fire extinguishing grenade: (1) "Durable": The chemical liquid inside is vacuum-sealed, so even after decades, there is no concern about drying out or becoming ineffective. (2) "Powerful": The fire extinguishing effect of the grenade is that after the grenade breaks, the chemical liquid inside turns into gas upon contact with fire. Wherever the gas reaches, the fire is immediately extinguished. Therefore, each grenade can extinguish a fire of more than 6,800 cubic feet, and the fire extinguishing time is only half a minute to fully take effect. Moreover, the more intense the fire, the more effective it is, because the more intense the fire, the higher the temperature, and the faster the chemical liquid turns into gas. (3) "Easy to use": The grenade weighs only two pounds and is very easy to carry. It takes little effort to throw, so men, women, old, and young can use it. In cities or rural areas where transportation is not very convenient, the natural fire extinguishing grenade can be used to organize a bicycle fire brigade, which is flexible and quick to take effect, and will have great benefits in firefighting. (4) "Non-toxic": The chemical liquid inside the grenade is purely for fire extinguishing purposes. It tastes slightly sour and has no toxic substances or other strong chemicals. Even when the chemical liquid turns into gas, the gas is harmless to humans and animals. (5) "Beautiful design": The grenade is very beautiful in design, small and exquisite. If it is installed indoors, it is quite elegant.</p>
<p>Nanchang Performance: Starting on the 10th of this month, a fire prevention movement week will be held in Nanchang, Jiangxi. The company has been invited to participate. Therefore, the company will send personnel to Nanchang in the coming days to demonstrate the fire extinguishing effect of the natural fire extinguishing grenade so that the people in the interior can also understand and facilitate purchases.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Odds and Ends <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— (Wang Shaba)</p>
<p>In the past, the union of men and women was combined under the feudal system's "parents' orders and matchmaker's words," leaving no room for one's own decisions. Consequently, both men and women, finding themselves incompatible, endured unspeakable suffering. In recent years, both men and women advocate "free love"—in theory, reducing all suffering. However, facts tell us otherwise. After marriage, there are countless disagreements, even leading to "divorce lawsuits," ending in separation. From this, we can realize that "free love is not necessarily blissful."</p>
<p>No matter how loving and understanding a couple may be, they sometimes turn against each other and quarrel for a while. Regarding this issue, I remember that when this newspaper's local news column held a "Reader's Mailbox" three years ago, a certain gentleman offered this explanation: "The bickering in a marriage is like the winding of a clock's spring, an inevitable stage. The spring of a clock, after running for a while, must be unwound and then rewound before it can run again. A couple is the same: a quarrel is like winding the spring." This is truly a wonderful analogy.</p>

<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The ancients clearly distinguished between the two characters for clothing, calling it: "The upper garment is called 'yi,' the lower garment is called 'chang.'" Therefore, shirts, vests, and jackets belong to the "yi" category. Trousers, socks, and skirts belong to the "chang" category. Even women in old families clearly distinguished between upper and lower garments, and the washing of clothes had separate tubs for upper and lower body garments. Even the bamboo poles for drying clothes, those designated for upper garments, were exclusively used for upper garments. When hiring a new maid, it was necessary to repeatedly remind them, "This is for the upper body, this is for the lower body," allowing no confusion. Ever since the social atmosphere changed drastically, and modern fashion was admired, the boundaries between upper and lower body were broken, and outdated lower garments were slightly altered and brought to the upper body. The first example is leggings. Leggings have trouser legs but no crotch, making them simpler to make. Furthermore, silk leggings were prepared to cover up the crudeness of cloth trousers. This was also where the elders showed their cleverness. Unexpectedly, these leggings have long been eliminated, but we now see police officers on the streets with sleeves on their elbows. Comedians say, "This is a disguised form of leggings, suddenly transforming from the lower body to the upper body." Coming to the present day, women are increasingly going barefoot, wearing openwork leather shoes, strolling through the city. Urban people are accustomed to this sight and no longer find it strange. According to a modern woman who spoke to me, "This barefoot trend is purely for economic reasons. It's because a pair of silk stockings, costing several yuan, wears out so quickly that it's better to go barefoot directly. People think going barefoot is so cool, but they don't know we're suffering. Because socks absorb sweat, without socks, the sweat makes our feet slippery and uncomfortable, especially for those of us who like to dance. After dancing several times, blisters easily form on our feet, causing pain that's hard to express." I said, "Since you're talking about economics, then why save on socks but wear gloves in such hot weather? Isn't that moving the lower body's socks to the upper body?" That modern woman glared at me with almond-shaped eyes and said, "You're clearly scolding me, but the cost of gloves is much cheaper than socks."</p>
<h3 id="e137">Selling Flowers <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>In our alley, every morning between seven and seven-thirty, a fifteen-year-old Suzhou girl comes to sell fresh flowers. (Not white orchids, but fresh flowers for inserting into vases.) Although she is not beautiful, she is petite and exquisite, and her slightly charming, half-innocent naiveté is indeed somewhat pleasing. Therefore, every morning when she comes, among the thirty-odd tenants in our apartment, at least a third of them use buying a bunch of fresh flowers as an excuse to chat idly with her, pestering her. I am a vulgar person, fundamentally ignorant of the art of appreciating flowers, and I also lack the leisure to flirt with that girl, so I originally didn't want to buy any. However, those room attendants almost had to come and peddle flowers to me for that girl every day. Sometimes, unable to resist, I would spend a dozen or so coppers to buy a bunch and use the pen holder as a vase to display them.</p>
<p>Last week, for a whole week, the room attendants didn't come to bother me, which I found very strange. Yesterday, I had to go out early, and as I walked downstairs, I suddenly saw two room attendants pushing an old flower-selling woman out the door. The old woman was struggling and pleading bitterly. I felt strange and hurriedly asked what was happening. The old woman said, "My daughter used to sell more than half a dollar's worth of fresh flowers here every morning. These past few days, she suddenly fell ill, and when I came to sell, these two gentlemen wouldn't let me in. Alas, sir, we are poor people, and if we can't do business, we will have nothing to eat. I beg you, sir, to please be accommodating." As she spoke, tears rolled down her face. But those two room attendants fiercely shouted, "Old woman, get out of here! Who wants to buy your old woman's flowers?"</p>

<h3 id="e139">The Blind <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Han Yu</p>
<p>On the roads and in the lanes, one can often hear the clanging of iron plates, which shows how many blind people there are.</p>
<p>Blind people are indeed pitiful, unable to see things and unable to do things. But the whip of life also strikes heavily on their backs, forcing them to find ways to support themselves.</p>
<p>Fortune-telling is the biggest outlet for blind people, but it is more difficult for them to learn, as they have to memorize everything. After learning, some open shops, like the "Direct Talk Fortune-Telling" shops that line Xizang Road. Their main business is not fortune-telling, but rather helping those who do fortune-telling to do penance. Their clever mouths can explain how bad the fleeting years are, making people willingly take out money. Another type is those who clang iron plates. They are often supported by someone. Their income is not very plentiful, because there is no extra income.</p>
<p>Character divination is also a profession for blind people. They dig several different holes on each character card. As long as they feel the number of holes, they know what character it is. The last type is beggars. They simply have no ability to be self-reliant and can only use their disabilities as tools for begging.</p>
<p>Blind people are indeed pitiful, and there are many people who pity them; therefore, there are many who are not blind but pretend to be blind to make a living. There is a blind fortune-teller in Nicheng Bridge who, although he keeps his eyes closed, his eyeballs are constantly moving. After a few minutes, he must open his eyes to feel comfortable. Once, he was buying cigarettes with his eyes open, and people laughed at him, and he couldn't help but laugh himself.</p>
<p>Blind people must have someone to help them when walking on the road. Therefore, most blind beggars are fake.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Newsreel <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai General News Agency</p>
<p>The world's ears and eyes: cameras, film, and screens, combined to dominate the throne of current affairs reports in the new century.</p>
<p>In June 1921, the 5th Far Eastern Games were held at Hongkou Park in Shanghai. The Commercial Press Motion Picture Department, with the consent of the association, collaborated with Dr. Peter, director of the YMCA film department, to film newsreels on-site, totaling three reels: the first reel was the scene of athletes entering the stadium and the opening ceremony, the second reel was the finals of various sports, and the third reel was the girls' gymnastics and the Boy Scout exercises. These three reels initiated the production of Chinese newsreels.</p>
<p>Mingxing Film Company occupies the position of the elder brother in the Chinese film industry because it was established earlier and still survives to this day. Do you remember what its debut film was? "The Orphan's Rescue" perhaps you might answer. But its first official film, not its first production. "Then, is it 'The Adventures of the King of Comedy in Shanghai'?" No, Mingxing Company's production did not start with a comedy, but with a newsreel: On March 9, 1922, French General Joffre came to Shanghai for sightseeing. He was the general who became famous for saving France from danger in the Battle of the Marne during the European War. The French Concession in Shanghai renamed the most prosperous Baochang Road to Joffre Road in 1915 to express gratitude. At this time, Joffre visited Shanghai, and Joffre Road was decorated with lights to welcome him, which was very grand. It was at this time that Mingxing Film Company was organized and established, and it filmed the scene of welcoming General Joffre as a test film. This test film was premiered at the YMCA in early April, while "The Adventures of the King of Comedy in Shanghai" was premiered at the Xia Ling Pei Ke Grand Theater on August 15 of the same year, and "The Orphan's Rescue" was premiered at the Shenjiang Grand Theater in December of the following year.</p>
<p>Although newsreels were produced in 1921-22, their importance had not yet been noticed, so occasional productions were made, but they did not develop. They only became slightly popular after 1927.</p>
<p>In 1930, Lianhua Film Company was established and paid much attention to the production of newsreels, publishing an issue every month on average, called "Lianhua News." By May 1933, a total of 30 issues had been published. At that time, the Propaganda Committee of the Central Party Department, in view of the great power of newsreels to convey current events, specially ordered the film division of the Central Propaganda Committee and Lianhua Company to cooperate in the production of newsreels. Previously, the Central Propaganda Committee also had newsreels published, which had reached 10 issues. After the cooperation, it assisted Lianhua in sending personnel to various places to film news, expanding the scope and enriching the materials, and renamed it "China News," with the signature "Jointly produced by the Propaganda Committee of the Central Committee and Lianhua Film Company." A total of 45 issues were published in a year. Previously, each issue only contained one current event, but now it contained at least three recent current events, and at most nine. In May of the following year, the one-year contract signed by both parties expired and was not renewed. In November, the film division of the Central Propaganda Committee was expanded into a film section and rebuilt into the Central Film Studio. Both parties continued to produce newsreels separately.</p>
<p>The production of Chinese newsreels, whether in quality or quantity, is far behind Europe and the United States; but compared to the past, it has improved a lot. I wish it continued progress! I especially hope that the news media and the film industry will cooperate, like Hearst and MGM in the United States, and the crystallization of the two companies will truly be a "newsreel"!</p>

<p>Jia Duocai gently shouted, "You've only been here for a few days, and you already want to go back. If that's the case, your family shouldn't have sold you." After speaking, he gently tapped the table again. This was followed by the sound of Yueying sniffing and the sobbing becoming slightly softer. Ma San felt it was an opportunity to speak and quietly walked to the door, saying through the curtain, "Madam Jia, you really can't cry anymore. Commissioner Gai upstairs has lost his temper and is only asking who is crying. He says that if you cry again, he will drive you off the mountain." Jia Duocai said, "What? Drive me out? You come in and talk." Ma San couldn't have been happier and walked in. He saw Jia Duocai sitting by the table with his head held high, smoking a cigarette. Yueying was sitting in the corner of the bed, sobbing and weeping incessantly. Jia Duocai said, "I am a businessman, whether it's a commissioner or an official, he can't control me. How can he say he wants to drive me out?" Ma San, seeing his attitude was so tough, pursed his lips and said, "Look at this bad luck! I got beaten up for your wife's crying." He described the incident of going upstairs, exaggerating it. Jia Duocai slammed the table and shouted, "This is outrageous! Xiaoxitian is not something I rented alone, nor is it something that Old Commissioner Gai rented alone. He can do whatever he wants in Xiaoxitian, but can't we cry in our own room? People are sad and shed tears, crying is inevitable. Given his status, when someone is crying, he should investigate what grievances they have suffered. How can he say that people are disturbing him? We insist on crying, let's see what he does to me!" (312)</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Besides applying egg white every night to prevent the wrinkles on her face from continuing to lengthen or expand, the Empress Dowager also had many methods specifically for dealing with those wrinkles. One of them was very special. Originally, there were two jade sticks, about two or three inches long, with gold handles at both ends, installed on her dressing table. Every morning, she had to use them to roll up and down on her face. This thing was very smooth and cold, and there was no powder applied to it, so I really didn't know what its function was? The Empress Dowager always sat patiently in front of the dressing table, constantly rolling it on her face, staring intently at the mirror, as if rolling it a few times would have an immediate effect. I was very surprised. Once, when she was not around, I boldly picked up a jade stick and tried it for a while. Unexpectedly, the Empress Dowager happened to walk in and was very unhappy when she saw it. But her unhappiness was not because I secretly used her old lady's things, but because she knew that I had some doubts about the function of her jade stick, so she was unhappy.</p>
<p>"This thing is of no use to you!" She immediately spoke very seriously, "People as young as you don't need any egg white, pearl powder, fat oil, etc.! This kind of jade stick is even more unnecessary!"</p>
<p>"Please forgive me, Empress Dowager!" I hurriedly kowtowed to her and apologized, "This servant did not dare to secretly use the Empress Dowager's things indiscriminately, but I just thought this jade stick was so smooth and cute, and I wanted to try it to see how comfortable it would be to roll on the skin... But I will definitely not dare to do it again next time!"</p>

<p>The Shanghai interport team participating in the Hong Kong-Shanghai interport swimming competition has decided to travel to Hong Kong on the morning of the 14th aboard the President Coolidge, which is leaving Shanghai. The team leader is Mr. Hex. The team is scheduled to board the ship at the New Customs Wharf at 11 PM on the 13th and arrive in Hong Kong on the 16th. The interport competition is scheduled to be held on the 19th, 20th, and 23rd at the Hong Kong Victoria Recreation Club. The Shanghai team is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hong Kong by ship on the 25th and is expected to arrive around the 27th. This year, the Hong Kong team has five Chinese athletes: Chen Zhenxing, a renowned 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle swimmer; Guo Zhenheng, who will be coming to Shanghai to study and is skilled in breaststroke; Liu Baoxi, who is skilled in backstroke; Huang Xipei, who is a diving expert; and Chen Xipei. As for the strengths of the Shanghai and Hong Kong teams this year, there are high hopes for the 50-yard, 100-yard, and diving events. Chen Zhenxing's 50-yard time is 25.2 seconds, while the times of Shanghai's Heimond, Bretton, and Wood are all around 25 seconds. It is also said that the original representatives selected for the 50-yard event were Heimond and Bretton, but now, due to too many events, Wood has taken over. As for the 220-yard, 440-yard, and 880-yard events, Hong Kong has the great Trolis, whose 880-yard time is 11 minutes and 49 seconds, 440-yard time is 5 minutes and 35 seconds, and 220-yard time is 2 minutes and 25 seconds. In comparison, Shanghai's highest records are: Krek's 880-yard time is 12 minutes and 59 seconds, Heimond's 440-yard time is 5 minutes and 46 seconds, and 220-yard time is 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The difference is too great, and there is no hope. The team consists of ten people, and the list is as follows:</p>
<p>Roster</p>
<p>Heimond (Captain), Hengbo, Wood, Parker, Wills, Bretton, Logan, Krek, Woodgen, Shibogen, Jian Erjie. Team leader: Hexlai.</p>

Mayor Wu is deeply pleased with this and, in addition to donating 100 yuan for travel expenses to encourage the Chinese athletes, he has scheduled a dinner for all interport athletes, both Chinese and foreign, at the municipal swimming pool on the evening of the 12th. After dinner, a grand international swimming competition will be held from 9 PM to 10 PM to allow the public to fully appreciate the athletes' skills, stimulate interest, and promote the sport. The program is extremely exciting and stimulating. In addition to the competition, the pool will be open that night, and those who enjoy swimming among the guests can swim in the pool before and after the competition. Tickets are sold for 40 cents per person, and those who also want to swim in the pool can purchase tickets for 60 cents. Colored electric torches are installed around the pool, and powerful light bulbs are placed inside the pool walls below the water surface. At that time, the lights and water colors will blend together, making it a pleasing sight to watch at night. It is expected that many people will come to watch and swim. The Zhabei Public Bus Company has opened special buses to transport guests to facilitate transportation for people from all walks of life. To encourage the interport athletes, Mayor Wu has specially made a large silver cup to present to the team as a souvenir. The competition officials and events are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e158">Amazing Results in the Nanyang Cup Division B; Li Wei Unexpectedly Overwhelms Liu Jie; Rain Repeatedly Hinders the Tournament; Finals Date Changed to the 19th; Old Qiu's Mishap; Performance by Celebrated Western Players Might Not Happen <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association originally planned to hold the finals of the Nanyang Cup Division A, B and C tournaments simultaneously during the Mid-Autumn Festival and to invite celebrated Western tennis players to participate in an exhibition match to entertain guests. However, due to unexpected difficulties, it was necessary to make temporary changes. The details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Finals Date Changed to the 19th</p>
<p>Due to recent rain and wet courts, the matches have been hindered. Apart from Division C, the Committee has been actively trying to schedule make-up matches for Division A and B. However, due to the tardiness of a few players, the match schedules of other players in the same group have been affected. Therefore, the Committee has now decided that all players shall be allowed to complete the Division A and B semi-finals within six days from today (the 11th) to the 16th, so that the Committee will be able to schedule the finals of Division A, B and C on the afternoon of September 19th (Thursday) at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Feihai Disappointed and Listless</p>
<p>The exhibition match was originally scheduled to have Mr. Qiu Feihai responsible for inviting Western friends. However, Mr. Qiu has been in poor form recently and in a bad mood. Yesterday, he suffered another defeat at the hands of Wang Wenzheng. As a result, he has not yet contacted any Western tennis players as of today, which makes it unlikely that the exhibition match will take place, dealing a blow to the perfect plans for the Nanyang Cup, which is also regrettable. In addition, Mr. Qiu has suffered repeated setbacks, returning defeated and crestfallen, his great ambitions have been diminished. As a result, his matches with Hou Shangxiong and Qian Yaobin have been postponed until today, affecting the overall situation.</p>
<p>Predictions for the Division B and C Champions</p>
<p>In Division B, Li Wei unexpectedly defeated Liu Zengshu by 6-3, 4-6, 6-4. If he can overcome Xu Demin in the semi-finals, then the hope of winning the championship will be as easy as turning his hand. In Division C, Chen Qihao and Zhan Wenyu fought fiercely for four sets in the semi-finals yesterday without being able to determine the winner. Today, they will have to continue the match. The winner will then face the winner of the match between Wang Shuqing and Zhou Jiaqi in the finals. In terms of skill, Mr. Wang seems to have the upper hand and is most likely to win the championship. However, Mr. Wang's father suddenly passed away yesterday, so he had to abandon his ambitions.</p>

Schools with six or more classes will install radios as needed. It is understood that the Municipal Education Bureau has completed the survey, totaling more than 40 radios in primary and secondary schools, and has sent a list to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval. Once the municipal government's radio station is established, radio broadcasts can begin. Radios are a powerful tool for promoting social education. After the station is established, schools can use radios to receive broadcasts related to education. As for private primary and secondary schools, the Education Bureau has previously forwarded the Ministry's order to each school for installation.</p>

It ranks among the top in the graduation examination and has received awards from the Education Bureau. This summer, after Wu Duan-nian took over, he made major improvements and strived for reform. The school's equipment has been continuously enriched, and the selection of teachers has been particularly careful. It is reported that the school opened on the 5th (five days ago), and due to the tight schedule, the opening ceremony was not held. Therefore, it was held yesterday (Monday) during the memorial week. More than three or four staff members and more than 250 students attended.

<p>#### Already Assigned by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</p>
<p>This time, the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School in this city has added 50 free student positions for poor students, 30 in China, selected and recommended by the education bureaus of each province and city, one from each province and city. The examination and recommendation of students from the three northeastern provinces and Rehe province is handled by the Northeast Youth Education Relief Office of the Ministry of Education. For overseas Chinese students in Southeast Asia, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will send letters to the consulates and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to select and recommend them. The association has carefully considered the situation of overseas Chinese in various parts of Southeast Asia and has allocated the places appropriately. Five places are allocated to British Malaya, four to Dutch East Indies, two to Siam, and one each to British North Borneo, Burma, Annam, and the Philippines. Notices have been sent to them to expedite the process. Liangjiang has received replies from the Philippines, Hebei, Hunan, and other places, stating that they have handled the matter in accordance with the regulations. In recent days, many people have written to the school to inquire about the methods of enrolling free students, and many have directly recommended students. The school has a limited number of places and is concerned that the procedures may be different and cannot be universally accepted, which is quite regrettable. However, for one overseas Chinese student recommended from Padang and Manado in Southeast Asia, Principal Lu has waived tuition fees and given preferential treatment in consideration of the difficulty of returning to China.</p>

<p>This was already the fifth head that had poked into the room in the last half hour; however, Mrs. Shu was used to it, so she raised her head and said briskly, "What is it, my child?"</p>
<p>Ned then walked in, carefully closed the door behind him, and said with a look of urgency, "Donn is here."</p>
<p>"Who is Donn?"</p>
<p>"He is a boy I know from playing the piano in the street. He sells newspapers and treats me very well. I saw him in town the other day and told him how good it is here, and now he is here."</p>

<p>The gold market fell yesterday due to the hardening of the exchange market, but because people's minds were stable and the report on Indian silver was shrinking, there was still a recovery. The situation for the day was extremely idle. With the swap approaching, the big players were watching from the sidelines, which led to this situation. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market was shrinking in the UK and flat in the US, and the forward silver price in Monte Carlo fell by 5 hao, to 2 li or less. The exchange rate had already started to rise, and the price of raw gold in London rose by 1 penny. People's minds were stable, and pre-market preparations for trading opened, rising to a strong 94 yuan. Da Da, Hui Xiang, Da Fa, Yong, and others sold strips at high prices, while Fu Xing, Yong Da, and De Cheng bought when they saw low prices. After entering the market, they hovered between 93 and 4 yuan, which was extremely mediocre. After the opening, the Central Bank announced the listed price, which was flat for the UK and rising for the US, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The listed price of standard gold was 931 yuan and 2 jiao, and people seemed dissatisfied, which led to the big players joining forces. The market lacked support, so it fell below the 90 yuan mark. Although there was a rebound, the banks' selling appetite was very strong, and Sassoon also blocked the market. The exchange market tightened and then loosened, and the selling pressure remained strong. It was predicted that the HSBC would list the price, which was also flat for the UK and the US. It once became weak, and the buyers took the opportunity to maintain it at low prices, and it turned flat. At this time, the banks were alternately lifting and blocking the market, and the gold market was also fluctuating, but because the transactions were limited, the fluctuations were very narrow. The exchange market tightened at first and then loosened, and the market also rose and then fell, lacking special changes. Later, the big players intervened to maintain the market, and it gradually pulled up. It was predicted that Indian silver would fall by 3 anna. At noon, it approached the 90 yuan mark, and the noon closing price was stable. The afternoon market was even quieter, and the fluctuations were limited for a long time, because although traffic was blocked, banks and foreign firms were willing to take in. After entering the market, although there was a small setback, because the first report on Indian silver was small by 1 anna, there was still a struggle. The big players covered their positions, and it once fell downstream, but because buyers were eager, it soon became flat again. Indian silver then fell by 2 anna, and buyers were even more eager, and it broke out of the 90 yuan mark and trended upwards. The banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and finally it became flat again. The following is a record of the market situation for the day:</p>

However, at present, the market is quiet, and businesses hope to adjust their profits and losses, but it has become a pie in the sky. Therefore, the invisible dullness is a great regret. Judging from the recent car conditions, except for the Japanese businesses, which are slightly smoother, other Chinese and foreign merchants and firms simply have no major business to do.

<p>Yesterday, the stock exchange and the market remained in a state of hesitation and stagnation, without any significant fluctuations. The enthusiasm of various groups remained sluggish, so market prices continued to fluctuate within a range of five cents to one dime. Each trading session had the regret of uneven highs and lows, so it was difficult to see any changes in the trend. The dull situation was not easy to break in the short term. The looming war between Argentina and Paraguay, the proposed but not yet implemented inflation announcement, and the economic cooperation that seemed close but distant – all these news were temporary rumors that could not be realized. Therefore, both bulls and bears were waiting for their respective targets. At this time when there was only air but no facts, both sides were waiting and watching, and market prices remained stable without fluctuations. Yesterday, from the opening to the closing, each trading session continued to fluctuate within a range of five cents to one dime. Sometimes there was a slight increase, but neither buyers nor sellers had large transactions. Even for Dead Stock and the 16th series, although the sales were not much higher than other series, there were still continuous sell-offs at high prices, without excessive sales. According to the results of the entire day, there were more gains than losses. The amount of gains was 1,999,500 yuan, with each increase being five cents to one dime. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Trading Company, yesterday (9th), the New York stock market saw a surge of floating profits. Prices fluctuated rapidly and showed a slight upward trend. Automobile and steel stocks rose slightly due to the expected expansion of work in those industries. Oil and utility stocks showed slight weakness. Small exchange stocks saw mixed gains and losses. The bond market was mixed but firm. The total transaction volume for the day was 2 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e177">Yarn and Cotton: Decreasing Chips for Spot Yarn Delivery <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell back at noon, and the situation remained stable. This was because the recent yarn sales were active and the customer demand was still strong, resulting in a gradual reduction of inventory. The bulls' intention was more calm. As for this month, due to the shortage of delivery chips, most factories suffered economic difficulties and have not yet resumed work. New sellers are wary. However, the surrounding environment is not yet very good.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Bulls' Intentions are Firm and High</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked yarn market, the prices of each month rose uniformly, and the situation became tighter. Because the US cotton report showed a decrease in production, and secondly, there were more than 2,000 bales of spot yarn sales in the market on the previous day, and there was a lack of near-month deliveries, the bulls' intentions were higher. The near month rose by 90 cents to $1.20, and the far month rose by 45 cents. The market turned weak again after the afternoon opening. It was heard that the sales of spot yarn were not as strong as the previous day. Some floating profits were happy to close out, and new sellers in the market were not enthusiastic. The second and third boards retraced by two or three cents. As a result, the closing prices of each month were lower than the morning closing prices by one, two, three, or four cents. The sales were: Hengda 350 bales, Gengfeng 500 bales, Changyu 600 bales, Hengde 300 bales, Renfeng 300 bales, Taichang 1,250 bales, Changfeng 800 bales, Dachangchang 400 bales, Xincheng 1,150 bales, Yuda 750 bales, and Dafeng 350 bales. The purchases were: Yukang 300 bales, Taixing 1,000 bales, Minghua 500 bales, Ruida 1,200 bales, Tongfeng 350 bales, Yuanyi 400 bales, Yicheng 750 bales, Hengchang 1,400 bales, Yongda 450 bales, Mingde 450 bales, and Tongji 850 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Strong Customer Sales of 1,000 Bales of Spot Yarn</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,106 bales throughout the day.</p>
<p>The market was stable, and the purchase amounts of various groups were as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 123, Ningbo 10, Guangdong 46, Nanjing 25</p>
<p>Xiamen 10, Changsha 15, Peers 20, Jiangxi 15</p>

<h3 id="e178">US Cotton Production Announced Decrease, Marked Cotton Bulls are More Enthusiastic <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The trend of US cotton production for the next period is 11,489,000 bales, a decrease of 209,000 bales compared to the previous 11,798,000 bales. The market price rose slightly by five to seven points, which boosted market confidence and strengthened the will of the bulls. However, the Ningbo group is still selling, and new cotton from various sources is gradually entering the market.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Trend is Upward</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, the market was firmer, and prices rose uniformly for each month. Due to the US cotton production being 309,000 bales less than the previous period, and the market price rising by five points, the bulls' intentions were even stronger. The buying atmosphere in the market was slightly stronger, and the table was tight. However, the shorts, considering the favorable weather conditions recently, were still selling at high prices. As a result, the closing prices for each month were one or two cents higher than the closing prices of the previous day. The market remained high after the afternoon opening. Most people expected the US cotton market to be bullish tomorrow, and the market condition was firm. As a result, the prices of each month rose by one cent to five cents again. The sales were: Yuanda 700 dan, Jifeng 1,000 dan, Renfeng 800 dan, Yicheng 3,000 dan, Yichang 1,400 dan, Yuanyuchang 800 dan, Changhe 1,300 dan, Taichang 1,300 dan, and Dachang 1,100 dan. The purchases were: Dafu 1,000 dan, Minghua 2,200 dan, Shenchang 1,700 dan, Ruida 2,100 dan, Shengyuan 800 dan, Tongji 900 dan, Yuda 1,800 dan, Shenji 1,300 dan, Yuanyi 1,200 dan, and Xinheng 900 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e179">Production Decrease: US Cotton Rises Across the Board <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with gains and losses of two to five points for each month. Before noon, the market was uninteresting because the government report was about to be released. The amounts of short selling were absorbed by traders and short covering. After the government released the report of reduced production in the afternoon, the market price failed to rise significantly due to the lack of large-scale speculative buying. When prices rose, there was quite a bit of selling from the South, so the market situation was flat. The closing was still stable. Spot prices rose by five points, and futures prices rose by five to seven points. The total spot price of British cotton was unchanged, and futures prices rose by three or four points. Indian cotton was weak due to bull closing and broker selling. Surat fell by 1.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 0.25 rupees, and White Western fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 9th):</p>

<p>Flour: Yesterday, in the flour market, the near and far months were in a state of fluctuation in both the morning and afternoon sessions. When the market opened in the morning, the price of foreign wheat was reported to be low, and spot sales on the side were stagnant. Speculators did not move, and factories also sold a small amount. The market seemed to be trending towards stability. However, the current raw material shortage and high prices had solidified the flour market. The international situation was still tense, and it was difficult to plan orders for foreign wheat. There were various rumors in the market. It was said that the expansion of the European-African dispute led to continued purchases by large non-industry players. The factory stopped selling, and the market immediately rose. The closing was stable. The current month was up 0.25, next month was up 0.10, November was up 0.05, December was up 0.25, and January and February were up 0.75 each.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, transactions in the crystal wheat market were not active in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, all parties were in a wait-and-see state, and hoarding was also of little interest. Sellers were unwilling to sell because spot wheat was scarce and the cost was high. Therefore, both sales and purchases were sluggish, and market prices were also fluctuating. Later, due to the tight flour market and the scarcity of goods, traders only made small purchases, and the market turned into a firm state. The closing prices were up 0.10 for the current month, up 0.05 for November, and down 0.10 for October. There were no changes for October deliveries. Both spot wheat arrivals and inventories were low. Factories continued to have commitments to fulfill. Yesterday, 1,000 bags were sent from Fuzhou. Shandong wheat was 3.70 yuan, and Guandian, Mingguang, and Shahe were all 3.66 yuan. Jiangbei wheat was all 3.63 yuan. The prices were similar to the previous market. The outlook is uncertain.</p>

<p>Only numbers 11 and 12 rice (from South Shanghai) have arrived (a total of 2,450 piculs). People's hearts have settled slightly, and the overall situation has gradually stabilized. The sales market in this street is more active. Dealers from Qingdao and Tianjin have also handled more than 600 bags of various broken rice and thin early rice, etc., presenting a stable situation. The market price is similar to the previous one, and the trend seems to be slightly firm. Various new early rice are pouring in daily, the weather is clear and sunny, and the market continues to show signs of softening, continuing to fall by more than two inches. Fortunately, Yangchuan and other new high-quality rice were scarce and had a good aroma, showing off their outstanding quality. Although the quality of high white rice varies, their prices seem to be different. Chenbaiguang's price has fallen by 0.20 yuan due to limited sales channels. (According to statistics, 34 or 35 dealers from the Hebei area arrived in North Shanghai yesterday. The market's sales of various goods, such as broken white rice, are slightly better, with prices down by a small amount of 0.10 yuan. Early thin rice prices are down by a small amount of 0.10 yuan. Bianyuan's price is down by a few cents. Dongxin's arrivals are still pouring in, but sales are sluggish, with prices down by a small amount of 0.10 yuan. New Yangjian and other top-quality rice continue to arrive, and sales are slightly active. The market price was down by a small amount of 0.20 yuan in the early morning market, and the evening market was stable. The price of new Bujian was down by a small amount of 0.20 yuan, and the price of new Kejian was down by a small amount. The prices of other goods were down by 0.07 to 0.08 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation in the foreign rice market is still active. However, Yongxian's arrivals are pouring in, and prices are immediately down by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan to nearly 0.10 yuan due to the pre-festival sales. Other customer Xian rice is also flat and soft, and prices are down by a small amount. The interest in the street is still strong, and 642 bags of Yongjiang machine early rice, 76 bags of early brown rice, and 200 bags of Wenzhou machine rice were immediately sold. Both foreign rice inventories and arrivals are low. Most of the goods returned from other ports are sold at the market price, and dealers do not sell them, while sales channels are available in this street and in the Northern Ocean groups. Yesterday, more than 4,000 bags of foreign rice were opened, and the Northern Ocean groups bought one-fourth, while this street only bought more than 1,000 bags. The foreign rice market price was originally softened by Xian rice, but now that the market in this street is active, the market price can be stabilized.</p>

<p>Recently, the green tea market situation has been mixed. Green teas like needle and eyebrow teas from Tunxi and other sources have seen slightly more active sales in Europe. The British firm Tonglv Fuyangxing exclusively purchased more than 300 boxes, and the market price has stabilized. However, the market for Zhenmei green tea is still sluggish. Only a small amount of hand-picked tea was sold yesterday, with about 20 boxes being sold. Wholesale sales have almost completely stopped. Tea merchants generally believe that it is impossible to develop without reducing the selling price. There have also been no large-scale transactions in Gongxizhu tea and other goods.</p>

<p>The most popular wool goods and flannels in the market are the Sichuan and Huai groups. The front shops in this street that sell flannels, satins, and foreign goods, as well as the Western clothing tailors, have been opening up for sales of Western goods such as toune, horse riding pants, shawmeti herringbone flannels, Japanese medium-thick serge, thin floral flannels, plain serge, yuanzhi yellow flannels, poplin, Italian wave Melton plain thick flannels, rotten flannels, overcoat flannels, and domestic wide and narrow camel hair fabrics, Yuan Chang yellow flannels and silk-like feathers in bulk and retail for days.

<p>Cottonseed oil is divided into two types: refined oil and crude oil. The sales market for refined oil is large, as it is used by soap factories and in various places as a mixture for raw soybean oil. Crude oil is mostly sold to foreign factories for mechanical use. There are no less than a dozen oil factories in this city, but unfortunately, they have been affected by the world economic downturn, and sales have deteriorated daily. Yesterday, the Wenzhou group purchased 50 dans of refined oil at a price of 11.30 yuan. The market was sluggish due to the lack of movement in foreign refined oil and the closure of the soap factory's appetite. However, the factories, considering the low price of goods, are calling for higher prices, and it will not be difficult to rise if the subsequent sales market is good.</p>

<p>There was not much change in the sugar market yesterday. Transactions were still small. The guild quoted 24 coarse sugar white sugar, with a spot price of 17.18 yuan, but no transaction was made. The transfer price for coarse-grained high-quality goods was 5.40 yuan, with a transaction of 100 bags. Taikoo Sugar B Mark and this factory's cotton white sugar were unchanged. The Chaozhou group opened 300+ packages of domestic cotton red, the upper-middle was 11.65 yuan, to 11.70 yuan with varying price depending on quality, and the goods were dry with good color. The high-quality goods were priced at 12.20 yuan by the market, but not agreed by the sellers. The trend was better. Additionally, over a hundred packs of Zhizhiyang were offered at 13 yuan to 12.80 yuan. Because of the lack of support in Chaoqing, the transactions were few and there were signs of slackening.

<h3 id="e186">Annals of the Gengzi Year from Abroad <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>I once mentioned a Gengzi notebook titled "Annals of Yuguan," pointing out the mutual contradictions of imperialism in China at that time as reflected in that book. Recently, I acquired a four-volume "Annals of the Gengzi Year from Abroad." Initially, I only intended to look at the foreign situation during the Gengzi year, but I unexpectedly discovered the same characteristics as "Annals of Yuguan," allowing us to see more clearly how the "Allied Forces" were secretly fighting. Although the author is the German ambassador Lü Hai-mai, it is not exactly an "official document."</p>
<p>This book was compiled when Lü Hai-bao stepped down from his post in the Xin Chou year (1901) and returned to his home country to have it printed. It records everything from the beginning of the incident to Prince Chun representing the Qing court to Germany to offer apologies, and his own resignation. The first volume contains the telegrams he sent to the Chinese government, officials in various provinces, and ministers in other countries. The second volume contains telegrams from various parties. Volume three records his conversations each time he visited the Qing foreign minister. The last volume contains imperial edicts, treaties, German replies, and translated foreign opinions.</p>
<p>The "Preface" describes the situation in Germany at that time: "When the killing of the envoy led to conflict, and the Allied Forces invaded the north, Germany's precautions increased, resulting in secret telegrams. It was heard that they were delivered circuitously through other envoys, and information about Chinese affairs was often blocked, making it difficult to ascertain the truth, similar to ancient wax letters or messages tied to geese. When the news of Minister Ketteler's assassination reached Berlin, the whole country was in an uproar. Ignorant people often made disrespectful remarks towards the Chinese embassy. Therefore, I strictly instructed the staff and translators to stay indoors to avoid danger." This is a fact that we would expect. The telegrams he sent also generally confirm this. A telegram on July 9th stated: "The German envoy was killed, and the German Emperor is very angry. He has sent four ironclad ships and one speedboat to China, with about two thousand soldiers. He vows to take Beijing and form an alliance under the city walls. Public sentiment in Berlin is turbulent and the situation is very dangerous." However, a telegram on June 23rd already contained the words "Recently, rumors have become more malicious, and officials and civilians in the German capital are panicked. Various countries are conspiring against us," indicating that even before Ketteler was harmed, various countries were already communicating with each other and preparing for war.</p>
<p>The most amusing thing is that the Chinese government, even though Ketteler's death had become a well-known fact, still tried to cover it up, which is incredibly foolish. A telegram from the Beiyang Minister Li on June 5th stated: "… Minister's telegram, the German envoy was killed by rioters in the capital. No one outside knows. Secretly consider whether there are any measures to eliminate the problem." Such a major event was described as "no one outside knows," and asking "whether there are any measures to eliminate the problem" is simply absurd. But the absurdity doesn't stop there. Later, when going to Germany to offer apologies, the German Emperor insisted that Prince Chun and his entourage kowtow. After much negotiation, the German Emperor only allowed Prince Chun to be exempted. What were Prince Chun's plans at this time? A telegram on July 19th stated: "However, the counselors kneeling and bowing would harm the national dignity. Now, as a compromise, only bring Jin Kai and Geng Yin-tai as interpreters when delivering the letter of credence. Zhang Yin-chang and others should still follow the previous telegram, either feigning illness or temporarily avoiding the scene, to avoid kneeling and being humiliated." It is truly unexpected how pathetic and laughable this is. This is why the German Emperor finally conceded, insisting that the letter of credence must be "received while seated."</p>
<p>Where is the so-called reflection of the contradictions between imperialist powers? On August 13th of the Gengzi year, the minister to Russia sent a telegram stating: "The culprits have been punished, and compensation has been paid for the killing of the envoy. The German commander has not been allowed to come to Tianjin, and German troops have been dispatched to Jinghai, while Russian troops have been dispatched to seize the Beizhi and the Taishan Customs. What is the conspiracy?" The "What is the conspiracy?" doesn't need to be asked. The "Annals of Yuguan" has already indicated it directly: Russia wants to open a route back home, occupying the important roads to Russia. Germany, England, and others fear that they will gain an advantage, so they take advantage of the Russian troops' movements to occupy the Jian Pass area with their navy. The same can be seen in the "Annals of the Gengzi Year from Abroad." The death of Waldersee should have been an important matter for Germany, but from the repeated conversations between the German foreign minister and Ambassador Lü, it does not seem to be the focus. What is the focus? It is actually the actions of countries other than Germany in China. Has China given them special benefits? Have they signed secret agreements with other countries granting them special commercial interests? For example, a telegram on January 3rd of the Xin Chou year stated: "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter requesting a meeting, stating that before the peace talks are concluded, China should not sign agreements with them or their companies, ceding land, money, and other benefits." A telegram on the 4th stated: "I suspect that Germany fears that other countries will take the opportunity to seize benefits. They are now the leader of the Allied Forces and cannot help but think about gaining benefits, but they do not want to be criticized." A telegram on March 11th is even more mysterious:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs secretly stated: Whether the Allied Forces withdraw depends on the payment of reparations. It is heard that Governor Zou is very anxious about the payment of reparations. If there is a practical solution, it may be confidentially informed. If the matter is feasible, Germany will definitely make extra concessions and help China persuade other countries to agree. Please relay this message confidentially to the Xiang Governor." I have already sent a confidential telegram to the Xiang Governor. When asked about their intentions, they secretly said that they heard that some people were profiting from the payment of reparations, and they feared that Chinese officials would be deceived by them. Therefore, Germany wanted to know China's true intentions. Please keep it secret to prevent disclosure.</p>
<p>This truly reveals the so-called "Sima Zhao's intention," such as "Germany will definitely make extra concessions!" The book also records many questions from the German Foreign Ministry: Is the news of the agreement with a certain country true? What kind of benefits have been given to that country? They constantly criticize that all countries have bad intentions, "only Germany can help China." Those who heard these sweet words at the time must have had certain feelings. In fact, all crows under the sky are equally black, further exposing the reality of their mutual contradictions. This is revealed in telegrams and conversations, and I will not list more examples. It says very little about the domestic situation, mainly focusing on the interactions between the minister and Germany. The translated articles attached at the end of the book include some that express goodwill towards China and others that attack it, but none of them can see a bit of "justice" like the few articles excerpted in the "Selections of Humor and Seriousness." Therefore, I will abandon this and quote seven excerpts from the "Selections":</p>
<p>A French military officer said: "The intention of the Boxers is very good. Chinese people should deceive all foreign missionaries who want to come to China to preach. If I were a Chinese, I would want to do what the Chinese do. If China wants to preach to our France, I would also want to drive them out of France." A certain newspaper in England wrote about the Boxers: "We thought China was completely dead, but now there are these people, so it is not completely dead!" Count Okuma of Japan said: "Do not criticize the Boxers. What we did thirty years ago was also like the Boxers." A German soldier who returned home spoke highly of the Boxers: "Children over ten years old can all hold knives and move forward, not afraid of death at all. Even if the front row is dead, they continue to advance. They are truly incredibly brave." He also said: "German soldiers once fought in a certain place and saw soldiers fall down. They then drove forward, and the fallen soldiers suddenly rose up, killing dozens of people. Another German soldier who was transferred back to the country from China said in Nagasaki that the military officer to the Yang Bank said: 'Chinese soldiers are said to be useless, but in fact, they are not. Their bravery is unmatched by Western soldiers. I fought with Chinese soldiers in Tianjin. One Chinese soldier had already suffered seven injuries, but he still fought bravely forward. Finally, he was hit in the foot and fell down. I thought he was dead. Our soldiers drove past him, but unexpectedly, the soldier suddenly got up and desperately grabbed my soldier's foot. My soldier looked at his face, which was covered in blood and flesh, and was terrified, almost dying with him. Later, he stabbed him with the knife on the tip of his gun, and he fell down again. My soldier was able to escape.'"</p>
<p>These opinions are truly credible, but unfortunately, very few people know them. Now, I am fortunate to have encountered them, allowing us to glimpse the heroism of the Boxers, which is completely different from the general records and rumors. The "Selections of Humor and Seriousness" also discusses the "Boxer bandits," saying: "It is not known that although the Boxer affair cannot be taken as a lesson, its intention is quite surprising to Europeans. For decades, Europeans have insulted our people, and even bystanders cannot bear it. But none of the Chinese ministers have destroyed their families to face the national crisis, and none of the minor officials have united to fight for national justice. At that time, scholars were all immersed in personal gain. Now, suddenly someone rises up out of anger, not afraid of death, not avoiding difficulties. They believe that China still has vitality, or perhaps that China will revive because of this. All those in our country who have a little vitality must know this." This is a very insightful statement. I do not know who said it. However, it can also be seen from this that it is not necessary to wait until today to make a fair assessment of the Boxer Rebellion. Because I am discussing the "Annals of the Gengzi Year from Abroad," I have specially included this.</p>

<p>— Jiang Ji-ping</p>
<p>This morning, there was indeed a hint of autumn coolness. Although not all the leaves have fallen, the coolness of early autumn is already enough to make people uncomfortable. While I was still in bed, I heard the wind outside the window sounding a bit different. I aimlessly chanted, "The autumn wind rises, white clouds fly; the grass and trees turn yellow, geese fly south," and felt a bit sad in my heart. After getting up and opening the curtains, the sun was still so intimidating that my sadness disappeared again. In the evening, as I passed the front of the garden, the leaves of the poplar trees rustled. Suddenly, I remembered the line from an ancient poem, "Why are the poplars so rustling?" I looked up and saw that the leaves were still very dense, a dark green that was almost frightening. Perhaps because the sky was getting dark, the leaves of the trees were completely black. I felt uncomfortable again and lowered my head, afraid to look at it.</p>
<p>When I usually walk with my head down, I always think silently, so sometimes I even bump into people. After apologizing to them, I find it amusing. This habit of pondering is not good, I know it myself; but what can I do to stop it from thinking? My brain is not under my control, and besides, I have so many memories? For example, when the leaves of the poplar trees rustle, I think of something. Two years ago, I sat under a tree with a lady. Now we are married and have children. At that time, we were planning our future happiness and the brightness of our future, but what about now? Everything has disappeared, everything is mediocre. I don't know what path I should be walking. I only feel that people in this world are just "drifting"! The ancients said, "Life is like a floating dream," "Time flies like a swift horse passing a crack," and "My life is truly like floating." We seem to sigh too often about how quickly time passes, but the children who used to play ball with me have already gotten married. What can we do to not sigh about the rapid passage of time?</p>
<p>Looking up again, the crescent moon is already hanging on the corner of the pavilion. In a few days, it will be a full moon again, and in a few days, it will be a crescent moon again. This cycle, I don't know when it will end. Looking at it now, it is almost Mid-Autumn Festival again. Thinking about how the previous Mid-Autumn Festivals passed, it is still very clear. One Mid-Autumn Festival was spent with my mother in the courtyard worshiping the moon. I didn't seem to know what mysterious things were in the moon. My mother said that there were pine trees and gods in the moon. I raised my head and stared for a while. A very bright ball was speeding across the clear sky like water. Sure enough, it seemed like a pine tree filled most of the ball. I felt inexplicably happy. Another Mid-Autumn Festival made an even deeper impression. It was the first day I stepped onto the thorny path of life. I carried a small suitcase alone and stepped onto the deck of a ship. It was raining in the sky, and the deck was slippery. As soon as I got on the ship, I lowered my head and went into the cabin. I forgot that today was Mid-Autumn Festival. I didn't expect to wake up in the middle of the night. The sailors were playing mahjong, and the cracking sounds were so annoying. So I went back to the deck to take a look. The rain had stopped, and the moon was in the middle of the sea. The sea water was like silver snakes dancing, shaking the moon in the sky as if it were swaying. Painters cannot paint this scene, and I cannot write this scene. This is a magnificent view of the universe. I forgot where I was, I forgot why I left home this time, and I didn't even know that today was Mid-Autumn Festival. If I had remembered that today was Mid-Autumn Festival, you can imagine, "Every holiday makes me miss my relatives even more." People were eating mooncakes at home, while I was a wandering traveler, and I wouldn't know where to shed tears. Fortunately, I didn't remember that today was Mid-Autumn Festival at the time. Another Mid-Autumn Festival was in Qingdao, another Mid-Autumn Festival was in Shenyang. Each year is very clear. Now, although the moonlight is still the same as before, things have changed. It is no longer possible to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival like before.</p>
<p>The moon gradually rose. I had already turned into a small alley. Suddenly, walking from a busy and lively street to a dark alley, I felt unusually desolate and lonely. Turning back, I heard the sharp sound of car horns on the street, which felt like a lifetime ago, as if I had just woken up from a dream, and my nerves were a bit hazy. For some reason, the poem by Lu You that I read the day before yesterday also flooded into my mind: "The lights of the nearby workshops are as bright as books, the east wind blows the city sounds for ten miles, the distant workshops are silent and the doors are closed, only the smoke and moon are walked by no one... Returning to the empty study, I lie down feeling cold, the sick bones in front of the lamp cast a steep shadow..."</p>
<p>After arriving home, my wife asked me why I looked so depressed. I said it was nothing, probably just feeling a bit unwell. My wife didn't say anything. I didn't eat dinner and fell asleep in bed.</p>

<p>— Bai Chen</p>
<p>The little monk couldn't drag the bed board. The little tots were busy, sweated all over, only then moved it out from the outside. He put the stool in the very middle, and the two of them, exerting their strength, moved the bed board onto the stool. One end near the bed, the other near the side of the stove. The little monk pressed down on this end, the other end popped up. He pressed down on the other end, this one popped up. The two of them were having so much fun. The little monk, pointing at the end near the bed: "Come on!"</p>
<p>The little tot laughed and jumped. The little monk became even more pleased. He held down that end of the board: "Climb on slowly!" Waiting for his little sister to sit down properly, then he himself climbed on.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't it seesaw?" the little monk pondered for a while.</p>
<p>The little tot, unable to wait, shouted, shaking her body, "Move, move!"</p>
<p>Hey, now they were able to move it. As the little sister got on, he got off, making them both scared and having fun. The two of them opened their mouths wide, clutching the bed board tightly, gently moving, and they gently went up and down.</p>
<p>"Ha! So much fun!" the little tot wanted to clap her hands, but afraid she would fall down, she grabbed the bed board tightly, just smiling.</p>
<p>"High! High!" The little monk remembered that other people seesawed much higher.</p>
<p>The little tot didn't know how to go higher. After thinking for a long while, the little monk told her, "Use strength!"</p>
<p>Sure enough, using strength made it seesaw higher. The little monk was extremely happy. He exerted even more strength. The little tot was a little scared, "Brother, slower!"</p>
<p>Who knew that the board was a little disobedient, it couldn't slow down. The little tot shouted in a panic; upon hearing her shout, the little monk also panicked. The bed board shot towards the little monk's end, and the little tot fell down, colliding into the little monk, and by sheer chance, her head hit the edge of the iron pot of the stove behind them. Fresh blood immediately flowed. "Wah!" the little tot cried.</p>
<p>The little monk, who had fallen on the ground, with the bed board pressing on his leg, crawled out from under his little sister, but could no longer stand up. Seeing the blood on his little sister's head, flowing like a small river, he was scared out of his mind. He pressed down on the wound, but his leg was unable to move. The blood still flowed like that.</p>
<p>The little tot shouted, "Mom..." her voice getting lower and lower as she shouted.</p>
<p>The little monk also shouted, "Mom!..." his voice getting more and more tragic as he shouted.</p>
<p>The sound was extremely terrible, but Mom still hadn't come back. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e190">On Tangerines (Part 2) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>Speaking of Florida tangerines, I have a connection with them.</p>
<p>It must be said that on July 6, 1930, my wife, Jingyi, suddenly took a turn for the worse due to intestinal disease and was rushed to the Red Cross General Hospital to be operated on by Dr. Ji Geng. She barely survived, and fortunately, after being hospitalized for a month, she managed to keep her life. At that time, my youngest boy, Shen'er, had just been born for eight months and had not yet been weaned. With his mother in the hospital, what could be done with this nursing child? When a wet nurse was hired, he looked at her, but wouldn't eat. When milk powder was mixed and put in a bottle, he sucked once, then refused to suck anymore. He was happy to drink a small bowl of rice broth with sugar. After drinking it for a few days, he didn't drink it anymore. He especially liked to drink rice broth mixed with a little chicken or fish soup, which had a salty taste. Only at night, when there was nothing to give him to eat, would he cry almost the whole night. One night, I bought a Florida tangerine, peeled it and put the segments into his mouth one by one. He was extremely happy, sucking on the tangerine segments as if they were nipples. He could eat two or three segments at a time. When he cried, I would give him tangerines to eat, and that night could be considered a comfortable one for him. From then on, I gave him tangerines to eat every night as milk. He ate eight or nine dollars worth of Florida tangerines a month, which was almost the same as the money spent on hiring a wet nurse. As a result, he became a small consumer of American tangerines, and I also developed a liking for eating this kind of tangerine.</p>
<p>Many years ago, I was extremely thin and would cough whenever I caught a cold. There was a suspicion of lung disease. As the saying goes, "One tangerine holds phlegm," so even if I had good tangerines, I didn't dare to eat too many. In fact, the saying has no basis. According to old medical books, dried tangerine peel and the white fibers of the tangerine are both things that help digestion and dissolve phlegm. It is said that there was a tangerine tree in the Yamen of Huazhou in Guangdong. Eating the tangerine peel boiled in soup could immediately dissolve phlegm and stop coughing. To this day, Huazhou tangerine peel is still recognized as a special medicine for dissolving phlegm and relieving coughs in Chinese medicine. There was another reason why I didn't dare to eat tangerines. I had suffered from stomach problems for more than ten years. Western doctors said it was hyperacidity, and I didn't dare to eat too many acidic things. Some Western doctors said, "Those who eat too many tangerines often suffer from acidic diseases, causing the body's tissues to have an acidic reaction. To cure this disease, one must abstain from eating tangerine juice." My wife, Jingyi, had suffered from stomach problems and had to avoid eating acidic things. She absolutely dared not taste tangerines. Later, a Western doctor advised us to try eating tangerines, saying that if eating tangerines did not worsen our gastrointestinal problems, then it would be best to eat more tangerines. It is said that "tangerine acid is an organic acid. Once it enters the intestines, it is decomposed and loses its acidity, instead having an alkaline reaction. Tangerine juice contains many minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, iron, potassium, sodium, chlorine, and sulfur, especially potassium, which can enhance alkalinity. Therefore, eating too many tangerines will not cause acidity. Furthermore, tangerines contain a lot of vitamin C, and the sugars in tangerines are easy to digest. The vitamin content of tangerines also has the effect of stimulating bowel movements, which is really valuable. Therefore, it is good to eat more tangerines." After I ate tangerines, my stomach problems didn't change, so I advised my wife to eat them too. At first, my wife hesitated and didn't dare to try it easily. Only once, when she wanted to eat them, she ate half a Florida tangerine and felt very comfortable in her stomach. Afterwards, if she didn't eat tangerines after a meal, she felt uncomfortable. Therefore, tangerines became a daily fruit for our family, accounting for a large proportion of our daily consumption. However, in order to treat our illnesses, we couldn't worry about so much.</p>
<p>According to a folklore in Hunan, there is a well in the Chenzhou area, surrounded by tangerine trees, so it is called Tangerine Well. A Taoist named Su and his old mother lived next to the well. One day, the Taoist Su said to his old mother, "Mother, I am going to become an immortal. I think there will definitely be a plague next year. Only the well water here, boiled with one tangerine leaf, can cure the disease." After the Taoist Su said this, he ascended to heaven. The following year, a plague did break out, and nine out of ten people died. Only those who had eaten the well water and tangerine leaf soup as instructed by Su's old mother recovered from their illnesses. To this day, many pharmacies in Hunan still hang signboards with the inscriptions "Tangerine Well Flowing Spring" or "Tangerine Well Sprouting Spring." When people in Hunan talk about tangerines, they still don't forget this story.</p>
<p>Now it is autumn again. From the end of autumn to the beginning of winter, red tangerines enter the market. But I don't know if the tangerine orchard at my old residence under Mount Yuelu is still bearing abundant fruit, both green and yellow, and ripe? Alas, that was more than ten years ago!</p>

<h3 id="e191">Is Bizarre Clothing Detrimental to Public Morality? <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The customs of the north and south of China seem to be contagious to each other. Not long after Guangzhou banned co-ed swimming, Beijing followed suit. As soon as Beijing banned co-ed schools, there was a rumor that Guangzhou would do the same. Recently, the two places have unexpectedly begun to ban bizarre clothing.</p>
<p>Beijing: On the evening of July 30th, at the Harbin Theater, about ten policemen carrying box cannons and small pistols swarmed in and ordered all modern women wearing clothes as thin as cicada wings and bare legs without socks to leave the theater, not allowed to watch the show, and to return after changing clothes. At the same time, there were also policemen guarding outside the door, and all women with bizarre clothing were stopped, without exception. In general, modern women could only hang their heads and return home, and the amusing scene came to an end.</p>
<p>Guangzhou: A few days ago, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau issued a clothing standard, advising women to abide by it, and ordering Western clothing stores not to make new-style clothes in the future. They also sent female propaganda teams to give speeches in public places. But after more than ten days of implementation, there were still women wearing bizarre clothing and strutting through the streets everywhere. The Public Security Bureau believes that compulsory enforcement is necessary to be effective, so they decided to strictly ban it from September 1st. Those who resist will be taken to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Recently, because there are so many people in our country who are open-minded about customs, a group of women has been very unlucky. In our eyes, so-called bizarre clothing is just a relatively new style, and there is no need to make a fuss about it. If we want to promote thrift and make a correction, there are some reasons to be said. But some people always point to this as detrimental to public morality, and unless it is strictly prohibited, there will be no way to restore the world's morals and people's hearts. This kind of view is too pedantic. We really don't believe that a new-style clothing will cause damage to morals and physical health. Most Western women are bare-legged and bare-chested, but we have never seen them damage public morality because of this. Is it true that Chinese people are all lustful, and they will have evil thoughts as soon as they see a certain part of a woman's body? This is truly a disgrace to the Chinese people. Taking a step back, even if bizarre clothing is considered seductive, it can only be dealt with through persuasion. It seems unnecessary to threaten with guns, and compulsory enforcement is not a proper method.</p>
<p>We still remember that in March last year, a so-called modern vandalism incident occurred in Hangzhou. A group of hooligans used nitric acid to damage women's clothes everywhere. This barbaric act was quickly banned by the authorities. However, the President of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jingwei, specifically issued a statement to explain the meaning of modern, saying that modern is modern. It can be seen that modern is not a sin, so why should we hate it so much? In fact, there are many things in society that harm public morality, and it is impossible to ban them all. Bizarre clothing, in the final analysis, has little to do with public morality. If the authorities must use all their strength to deal with it, it is really a waste of effort.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Yu Shanfu <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Weizhi</p>
<p>Two Sculptures of People</p>
<p>Yu Shanfu, he is my senior apprentice, — I rely on my father's remaining influence — to have such a senior apprentice.</p>
<p>His leg is somewhat broken, so his name is not as famous as his congenital illness. People generally call him "Crippled Leg," at most, some people know his name is Shanfu, so they call him "Crippled Leg Shanfu." As for his surname, only a very few people know.</p>
<p>He is a very good person, sincere and enthusiastic. Whenever something happens, he is willing to put his work aside to help others. He often gets fired from his job for being nosy, but after losing his job, he doesn't blame anyone. He must finish that matter before trying to find another job.</p>
<p>Because of this, he is often criticized behind his back by other senior apprentices who think they are smart, "The emperor is not worried, but the eunuch is anxious," rushing around like a headless fly, what good is it?</p>
<p>But when those senior apprentices who think they are smart have something happen, they will look for Shanfu.</p>
<p>Although Senior Apprentice Shanfu had heard of this shortcoming before, as long as someone finds him and asks him for help, he will still run around enthusiastically.</p>
<p>He said, if fellow apprentices don't help each other, who else can you ask to help? Although he knows that helping will not benefit him at all, and sometimes it will even "bring someone else's coffin to your own home" (note), he still runs around regardless.</p>
<p>Sometimes, meddling in other people's affairs gets himself into trouble. In the end, the person involved will secretly say behind his back, "It's all because of 'Crippled Leg,' the matter could have been resolved long ago, but he got in the way, and now there is still no conclusion."</p>
<p>Naturally, he is very unhappy to hear this. After the matter is resolved, he swears to himself: in the future</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>may my sons and grandsons be damned if I meddle in other people's business again, I'm just making enemies for myself, doing all the work and then getting kicked to the curb, can't I just live a peaceful life?</p>
<p>But after some time, when someone else comes to find him, he forgets the oath he made.</p>
<p>His work skills are not very high, and he also likes to meddle in other people's business. Often, after working in a shop for only a few days, he gets asked to "help," so he puts aside the unfinished work for ten days or half a month. Therefore, when colleagues in Shanghai hear someone mention Crippled Leg Shanfu, they all shake their heads. Some people will even say to the person who came, Crippled Leg, his skills are not very good, and he also likes to meddle in other people's business, our shop is small, we really don't have room for him.</p>
<p>In this way, he usually works in our shop for half a year each year.</p>
<p>Working in our shop is also something he can't help. Because the fellow apprentices look down on him, they often make fun of him with cold words, and he is also somewhat afraid of my father.</p>
<p>Because he can't stand being restrained, and he is used to being a wild horse, so after some time, his ambition can't be suppressed, so he says:</p>
<p>"Master, I want to go to the outer docks to look for work, I heard that the market in ×× is very good recently."</p>
<p>Every time, my father always smiles and doesn't say yes or no: "You always have to be steady, you're over thirty years old, and you still like to meddle in other people's business like a seventeen or eighteen year old, the outer docks are unfamiliar, you have to be even more steady."</p>
<p>After my father leaves, he says to himself as if talking to himself: "Master is still saying the same old things, treating me like I'm three years old," and then, he happily says to me, "Younger brother, I'll write to you when I get to ××."</p>
<p>That night, his whereabouts are unknown. The next afternoon, he takes the tool cart away.</p>
<p>In this way, it has become a routine. When the neighbors see him taking the tool cart, they jokingly say: "Crippled Leg, are you going to open up a new dock again?"</p>
<p>Three days after my mother died, he somehow got the news, bought some paper ingots and incense candles, rushed over, kowtowed in front of my mother's coffin, and the first thing he asked was:</p>
<p>"Where is the mistress's coffin placed?"</p>
<p>After being told where the coffin was, I wrote a note and put it in my pocket, saying that although he was one step late and didn't see the mistress's last moments, he still had to see the coffin to feel at ease.</p>
<p>Since that meeting, we haven't met for three whole years. A few days ago, I ran into him on the road. He has changed his profession and is making a living by selling crickets. Before parting, he said: "Younger brother, do you still raise crickets recently? I have a very good one here, you can take it back to play with, it's just that the children here don't know what it's worth."</p>
<p>When I replied that I hadn't raised crickets for many years, he smiled and said, "I forgot, you are an adult now."</p>
<p>(Note: "Bringing someone else's coffin to your own home" means getting involved in other people's affairs.)</p>

<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>(1) Escorting the Prisoner</p>
<p>It was a gloomy day after the snow.</p>
<p>Outside Qianmen, many idlers were crowding around, their faces excited. Their breathing made them sound like trains arriving at a station, with hot air puffing from their noses.</p>
<p>"Going to Tianqiao to see the execution!"</p>
<p>The children shouted loudly. The people standing on both sides of the road craning their necks and looking anxiously at the dark crowd behind them.</p>
<p>"Here it comes! Here!" All kinds of uneven voices flowed out of the mouths of the audience unconsciously. Like a famous actor coming on stage, thousands of arrows of eyes shot at the car behind.</p>
<p>The police car escorting the way slowly drove past. The police riding on horses swung their wooden sticks to drive away pedestrians in the street. "Get out of the way! Hey, get out of the way!" The people riding on horses shouted sternly. This was their proudest moment.</p>
<p>Following behind were three spacious trucks. A prisoner was standing on the truck. At this moment, cheers rose from all directions.</p>
<p>The prisoner standing on the truck easily unbuttoned his coat, the corners of his coat fluttering in the north wind. He was a strong man with a dark complexion, his piercing eyes scanning the crowd standing on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"Sing a song!" Someone asked the prisoner.</p>
<p>A smile floated on the man's face. Then he straightened his voice and sang a martial artist's tune:</p>
<p>"I, a hero... in the past..." The voice sounded particularly tragic in the north wind.</p>
<p>"Good! Good!" The road was like a stage, and the cheers were like a rainstorm.</p>
<p>At the entrance of a restaurant, the car stopped:</p>
<p>"Hey, shopkeeper, I want a catty of baijiu!"</p>
<p>"What a true hero!" The old bannerman carrying a birdcage exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>"That's right! A few days ago, two opium addicts were executed, looking dejected, it wasn't exciting to watch," said a young shop assistant standing next to him.</p>
<p>After the sound of the crowd followed the man and faded away, the remaining snow on the road had all melted into water, leaving behind a muddy street.</p>
<p>(2) Garbage Dump</p>
<p>Have you seen a garbage dump? This is a rare decoration of Beiping's city appearance.</p>
<p>At the end of a slightly secluded alley, and even in front of several university gates, there are such garbage dumps. Next to it, there is often a pool of verdigris-colored stagnant water, with mosquitoes leisurely floating in it.</p>
<p>Every day from early morning until dusk, some sanitation workers wearing red uniforms slowly push their dirt carts and dump the garbage here. Moldy vegetables, rotten intestines and stomachs, dead cats, dead chickens, and dead rats with fleas jumping and maggots wriggling pile up into a small mountain. The June sun steams it, the northwest wind carries it, and the neighbors all get this benefit.</p>
<p>However, many people also rely on this garbage dump to survive.</p>
<p>Similarly, from dawn until dusk, children, old ladies, and young girls also wriggle on this garbage dump like maggots. Most of them carry a broken basket in their hands, picking up coal balls, paper scraps, rags, canned food, broken glass bottles, etc. They use their hands, small bamboo whips, and concentrate on turning, picking, and snatching. Their hair has lost its black and shiny color, and grease has stuck it together. The children's heads and bodies are covered with sores, and they smear their ragged clothes with their stool and snot. Crows and dogs are also their common friends.</p>
<p>These are the ones who live on the things that people throw away! Especially the children, they suffer from the cold, they go hungry, they have no health.</p>

<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>I don't know when, and I don't know why, but I finally vaguely felt the existence of autumn.</p>
<p>During the day, I give my whole body and soul to the control of life, but at night, the disturbances of the day have completely disappeared. People exhale uneven breaths from their deep sleep, and leak out wisps of sobs and cries from their nightmares, as if they are extremely unwilling to remember the various worries of the world forever, or, at the very least, they are trying to secretly express the many grievances of life in their dreams—between these, there are many resentments and shames hidden: they are suppressed by the weight of life, day and night.</p>
<p>Even so: but the world is still quiet. How calm and quiet the night is: when people wake up in this empty night, a terrible loneliness and emptiness, like the heavy rain and lightning of summer nights, attack again and again: I feel every breath of day and night, and I also seem to feel every pulse of the night, all of which have such heavy and gloomy postures? I am afraid and worried, because I clearly understand and truly feel: the night is sinking inch by inch: it is getting deeper every moment. That kind of depth: is pitch black and has no end, thinking about it will make you feel suffocated!</p>
<p>Worriedly looking out the window at the road and the sky: the road is so dim that it is impossible to tell the direction; and the sky is still a desolate pitch black, from which the stars flicker and die out one by one. Is it impossible to find any news of dawn?</p>
<p>Feeling an unusual suffocation, feeling the vastness of the night, the news of dawn cannot be predicted, and the end of the night is difficult to anticipate, groping to let the soul fall into the bottomless pit, sinking down moment by moment, that is not a comfortable thing.</p>
<p>(Autumn, and autumn has already grown up - midnight in autumn is uncomfortable: a little lonely light, a string of intermittent chirps of insects and wind. A train passes from afar with faces full of wind and dust, weakly venting one or two sounds - as soon as I hear this, I can imagine the way it crawls through the wilderness - it has carried so many people, and how hard it has traveled so many journeys, no one knows to ask about it: and now, it is calling out tiredly and angrily.)</p>
<p>Then, the green romances of one's own past life - those hardships, insults, and taunts - fall lightly on the barren land of memory like a light dream before dawn, from blurry to clear, like a "dissolve" in a movie.</p>
<p>So I think: cherish yourself, pursue yourself, review yourself in the past days.</p>
<p>But, in the end, I doubted again: what am I? What is the past? What should the past self be?</p>
<p>The more I try to figure it out, the more confused I become, the thoughts in my mind are stirred into a mess by something: I even began to doubt the world, doubt humanity, and even doubt the whole of life!</p>
<p>Haven't some people said that doubt and speculation are automatic, immune "life diseases" that everyone from young to old must suffer from? If this is true, then how long will this dark and gloomy mood last, and when will my heart, like the sky on an autumn night, faintly reveal the dawn?</p>
<p>I am afraid, I am flustered, and finally, I hope - may this dissolution and collapse of the youth's belief in the world be just a nightmare before the long night is over, and when dawn breaks, it will disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>Even if, at present, it is still an unnamed black night - with endless desolation and length.</p>

<p>Aster is gentle and the spring painting is good. Saffron blossoms bloom all over, competing for spring fragrance. The blue sky is like a picture. Ma'erling wind sends a tinkling sound. The path is full of lush licorice green. The swallows are busy carrying mud in pairs. The yellow orioles chirping on the willows of West Lake. Continued broken sound startles the long hatred. A beautiful woman sits alone on a agarwood couch. Heartbroken touch recalls betel nut. I remember when I parted, chrysanthemum was blooming in the east fence. Tiansheng star changes the articles. He said he would travel far and aspire to the cloud tower. The laurel branches are steadily removed from the toad palace. If you get Weiji's blessing. When Angelica returns, her clothes will shine on the door. Avoid rewording the central media to arrive. Also need a letter from Liu Jinunu's home. I am especially afraid that your love is more varied than mint. So I secretly give you ginseng hidden in your abdomen. Really looking forward to it. This life lilies will become connected. Who knows that you have drifted away and do not return with fennel. It has made me sick with longing for a long time. The soul often narrates the joy bed. The whole body is as hemp and the heart is broken. Turmeric stops the congestion of the disease. Prevent the wind from sitting in front of the window. Lazy to write poems with angelica. Light powder has been thrown away for a long time, and the appearance gradually thins. The green box is not opened to change clothes. Zelen is not Bird Yun. Amber cup is not. Because you are white.</p>

<p>The old man has repeatedly questioned him. For you, I secretly lose my temper with fritillary. I was originally a beautiful girl from the cardamom family, including flowers. I respect you for your kindness and honesty. Therefore, I invited you to send a maid to open the golden lock. Lian Qiao matched the two mandarin ducks. You have also been painstakingly tempted by your hard work. What are you talking about? Pomegranate and Lotus are always in pairs. Several times, Xuanfu meets Wushan. It was actually a wild bee that broke through the lotus room of my slave. Now it is Midsummer, and Dongfeng sends it. I want to meet Niulang Road is vast. Could it be that another is in love with Xiangru, a maiden in the boudoir. I don't know what is tied to the field of Hook Vine Flowers. Silver and gold flowers cost ordinary things. It has made me hurt by the bitter rhubarb and the love is doubled. Ten thousand kinds of sorrows are like thorns. When night comes, I see the empty moonlight in the corridor. The water has already covered the basin and cannot be recovered. The slave can only delay the decision and tie it to the high beam. Forever break the dream of joy.</p>

So, under the anger of her feudal father, Hu Die is driven out. She has no choice but to throw herself into Sun Min's arms. The decadent life makes Hu Die change her past temperament.

<p>After Diao Gong Ban Hua suffered dissatisfaction from all sides, he recently fell ill due to stimulation and wrote a manuscript due to "having more leisure while sick." Today, while reading a certain newspaper, I again encountered Diao Gong's great work "Sweeping Away" (presumably not a fabricated text, impersonating someone else's name). It contains a poignant sentence: "According to reason, the workers in our film industry are only directors, screenwriters, actors, set designers, managers, and other personnel. But now, try to see how many 'unnecessary' parasites there are who have no relationship with the film itself but depend on the film for a living? There are those who follow behind film actors, those who specialize in taking photos of film actors, and those who specialize in providing 'unreasonable' hype for a certain company or a certain actor. I don't know if these people have any use for the real advancement of film? What's more, if they don't have the material to write articles, they might as well fabricate rumors that damage other people's private morality. If their own publications or journals don't have sales, they might as well forge texts and impersonate other people's names."</p>
<p>These kinds of demons and monsters should be "swept away" by all those who have even a little love for domestic films. However, wasn't Diao Gong previously famous in the film industry for his "good social skills" and "good at smoothing things over?" It is already too late to expose the trick now.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that film is not only a mass art of the new era, but also a most powerful propaganda tool in society. When the Zhonghua Company went to Kaifeng and Zhengzhou to shoot location scenes for "Chronicles of the Water Country," Mr. Bu Wancang, in view of the heavy suffering caused by the Yellow River floods in various places this year and the millions of disaster victims crying out for food, led photographer Shi Shisheng and many staff members to various disaster areas to film multiple copies of "Flood Disaster News" in the hope that the people of the country would contribute generously. The film has now been sent to Beijing for review. When it was previewed at the Lido Grand Theatre the night before last, the guests expressed extraordinary respect for Bu's enthusiasm in pleading for the disaster victims. Once the review is passed, it will be able to meet the audience. It is hoped that compatriots at home and abroad will have compassion and give generously, not only will the disaster victims be grateful for the deep kindness of saving their lives, but the filmmakers will also be infinitely grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Campbell's Amazing Car Record, 300 Miles Per Hour <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Average of 11.955 Seconds Per Mile. "Blue Bird" Breaks Four Previous Records.</p>
<p>Sir Malcolm Campbell, known as the "Speed King of England," held another car speed race near the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA, on September 3rd. As a result, he not only broke his previous highest record, but also reached his lifelong wish of 300 miles per hour. This is not only a personal success for Sir Campbell, but also a memorable event in the history of automobile speed. The official figure for this speed record is 301.1292 miles per hour. The record for 1934 was 276.816 miles per hour.</p>
<p>"Blue Bird" is the name of the car driven by Sir Campbell. The previous four records were also established by "Blue Bird." However, from 1931 to 1935, this car underwent a degree of improvement and innovation each time it set a new record. The engine also gradually increased in size. Now, the words "Blue Bird" and Campbell's record will be immortalized together.</p>
<p>When Sir Campbell drove on the Bonneville Salt Flats on the morning of September 3rd, members of the American Automobile Association were on site to record the speed and time. The initial speed announced by the timer was 299.874 miles per hour, which was still a little short of Campbell's hoped-for record. However, the difference was very small. Later, the timekeeper of the American Automobile Association discovered that there was a slight error in the timing. In fact, Campbell had exceeded the 300-mile record. Therefore, the association announced on the same day that the previous record of 299.874 was in error and corrected it to 301.1292 miles per hour. However, before the official disclosure of the mileage, some American newspapers reported it as 300.377 miles per hour. Soon all were corrected.</p>
<p>During the race, there was a dangerous incident. If it were not for Campbell's iron will and skill in driving, a major accident would have been inevitable. Campbell was able to get through such dangers safely and could be congratulated. As he was about to reach the finish line, the car had entered the limit mileage and was moving southwest. Suddenly, the front tire of that huge car burst. At this time, the speed of the "Blue Bird" was 280 miles per hour. We can imagine with our eyes closed how dangerous it was. If the wheels were slightly skewed or went off the track, Campbell would have been smashed to pieces. Fortunately, he did not panic and was very calm, keeping his eyes on the steering wheel and moving forward along the track. He finally overcame the difficult obstacle.</p>
<p>Campbell set the 300-mile record when he ran into the limit mileage. At that time, the car was heading northeast and the time was 11.83 seconds. The calculated speed of the car was 304.311 miles per hour. This figure broke the odd number of the American aircraft speed record. That record was 304.98 miles per hour, which was created by the late Mr. Whitell on September 4, 1933, in Granville, Illinois. Sir Campbell then moved southwest at a speed of 12.08 seconds per mile. The calculated speed was 298.013. These two records gave him an average time of 11.955 seconds in the limit mileage, obtaining a record of 301.1292 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The environment was very good on the day of the drive. The ground and visibility were good, but there was a slight breeze, which was a minor flaw. The wind reduced the forward speed of the "Blue Bird" by about 9 miles per hour. Since the disclosure of Campbell's 300-mile record, congratulatory telegrams have been sent from all over the world. Notable among them are the British Minister of Transport, Leslie Hore-Belisha, the British oil magnate, and sports celebrity Lord Wakefield. Campbell's creation of this 300-mile record is regarded as a great honor and a rare achievement in automobile driving and sports.</p>
<p>The 1934 record (276.816 miles per hour) was set on the Daytona Beach. At that time, Campbell stated that what he wished to achieve was 300 miles per hour, and that the day he reached this record would be the day he would no longer drive. Because this kind of driving is really a very dangerous thing. Campbell can be said to have achieved his wish this time. After the race ended on that day, Campbell said that he had to go through New York to board a ship to return to England on September 9th. After returning to England this time, Campbell will probably no longer drive on adventures. Campbell's courage is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Sir Campbell's five-ton "Blue Bird I" this time has a very magnificent appearance. The head is flat and wind-breaking, and the whole body is in the shape of a low rectangle. The front two wheels are single wheels, and the rear wheels are double wheels. The engine power is more stable than the last time in Daytona. In the one-mile journey, this "Blue Bird" takes less than 12 seconds to walk. The structure of this car is enough to stand out from all the vehicles in the world.</p>
<p>In the most recent 32 years, the speed of land vehicles has increased from the initial 68 miles per hour to Campbell's current 300 miles per hour. The difference has increased by almost five times. The records created by Campbell in the last five years are as follows. The average speed in 1931 was 206 miles per hour. In 1932 it was 245.733 miles per hour. In 1933 it was 253.968 miles per hour. In 1934 it was 253.6 miles per hour. In 1935 it was 299.874 miles per hour.</p>

<p>In the last year or two, the transportation authorities of various Western countries have paid great attention to the issue of noise reduction. In noisy cities, nine out of ten times the noise is extraordinary, which is annoying. Therefore, the authorities of various countries advocate noise reduction. In the noise reduction movement, one point that is worth mentioning here is that a car can also emit annoying noises at any time when driving on the street. In order to implement the noise reduction movement, what kind of method should we take to reduce the sound of cars driving? Mr. Beileshi, the Director of Transportation in London, appointed a number of experts as soon as he took office to study the causes of various sounds emitted by vehicles driving on the streets and to find ways to eliminate or reduce them. This committee was chaired by Henry Fowler. After several months of research, it was determined that using scientific methods to manufacture cars can reduce a portion of the noise from driving. If car factories can manufacture cars according to the principles they have set, then such cars can travel on the streets in any season of the year without annoying noises. If the Director of Transportation follows the principles they have set, then when registering new cars, many more regulations will be added to restrict the noise of cars. First, the internal combustion engine must be equipped with an effective muffler, and drivers must not allow it to make bursting sounds. When we recall, in 1933, more than 8,000 drivers in London were detained and fined for making improper noises with their cars. At that time, these regulations had already been included. However, the authorities did not pay attention to how effective the so-called effective muffler was when registering cars. It was nothing more than theory. From now on, regarding this point, it has been decided to make it a reality from theory. It is necessary to stipulate the effect of the muffler. At the same time, on the other hand, we are looking forward to the cooperation of general car factories so that the cars they manufacture can all reach a standard of quietness above a certain level.</p>
<p>The London authorities once designated a quiet area for testing. The results have proved that when the noise is reduced, the number of car accident cases can also be reduced. However, in addition to the mechanical aspects of the car and the driver, which can reduce noise, the noise of trams cannot be eliminated and is very annoying. Therefore, the London transportation authorities have now decided to use another type of silent electric car to replace the old trams. The results of the trial of this electric car have been quite effective. Therefore, the authorities have decided that in the coming year, 40 miles of tram lines in London can be replaced by silent electric cars. Whether this plan can be realized depends not only on whether the drivers and car manufacturing engineers meet the standards set by scientific principles, but also on whether people's actions and behaviors have moral creeds. This is a problem that electricity meters and car factories cannot control. Drivers, fast learning, noise, can always be careful and cautious, and can pay attention to public morality, then the so-called noise reduction problem, regarding the car part, will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>The fact has long been proven. The more disturbing the car's mechanical components and noise, the easier it is to cause accidents. A reckless or technically mediocre driver driving a car with bursting sounds is definitely very loud, and the number of accidents is also more than other drivers. Therefore, in the United Kingdom, the transportation authorities have decided to require cities to maintain a considerable quiet standard for car and horse traffic. Today's cars have undoubtedly reduced a lot of noise compared to the iron-wheeled carriages of the past. But we should still go a step further and reduce the noise of cars to a minimum in order to reduce the car accident record. It is very difficult to install a muffler on a locomotive due to its small size, but it is easy in a car. At present, reducing the noise from the exhaust of various parts of the car is an urgent and important issue. Because this kind of noise is the most ear-splitting. In recent years, car factories have been working hard to reduce the bursting sound of the exhaust to a minimum. They already know that a good car must have a good and quiet exhaust. In this era, people are indeed tired of the noise of nineteen out of ten. And to make the noise reduction movement a reality, cooperation between the transportation authorities and car factories is an undeniable thing.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Germany's Automobile Industry Under Hitler's Support <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>A recent report from the Berlin Automobile Association stated that Germany's automobile industry is now second in Europe in terms of quantity, and first in Europe in terms of scientific inspection of its products. It will soon compete with the United States across the Atlantic, etc. Germany's automobile industry has indeed made rapid progress in recent years, and it is not just general public relations rhetoric.</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that the reason why the German automobile industry has been able to make such progress is due to the support of the German leader Hitler for the automobile industry. When the Berlin Auto Show opened last month, German scientists gathered together. Mr. Hitler took the stage and gave a speech on the German government's dedicated development of the automobile industry and told a story, which shows the general importance Germany attaches to the automobile industry. Hitler's story is very meaningful and moving. The full text is as follows.</p>
<p>"Decades ago, there was a British resident in India who was very good at economic planning for daily necessities. This person was also good at managing cars. At that time, he had two exquisite cars. When driving, he often felt that the construction of Indian roads was poor, and the damage to the cars was very significant. Therefore, he petitioned the Indian government to improve the construction of roads. However, the Indian rulers at that time were slow to deal with matters and believed that if the roads were poor, it was not necessary to drive cars. They turned a blind eye. This person continued to apply to rebuild the roads, but never received a reply. This person was extremely angry and added various criticisms, but the Indian government still ignored him. Later, this person ran out of ideas and thought of a plan. He sent a beautiful car to the Indian King. The Indian King was very happy and drove this beautiful car on the streets every day. Unexpectedly, the car was destroyed soon. He asked the Englishman why the car was so beautiful but so easily damaged. The Englishman told him that it was because the roads were poor. The Indian King immediately ordered the local officials to improve the roads and hired 10,000 road workers to manage the matter. In a few days, all the roads in India were improved and completed, and this Englishman's plan was successful. Later, cars could be driven safely. However, the Indian government's neglect of the automobile industry soon led to the disaster of national subjugation. Even if it was not destroyed by this, it was also a considerable cause."</p>
<p>Hitler told this story to ridicule the Indian government's lack of construction, which led to the tragedy of national subjugation, and to encourage Germans to build. Hitler usually believes that life is short and time is precious. The time we spend on the road when we are engaged in our duties is very regrettable. Therefore, he advocates widely popularizing transportation equipment. In the 20th century, the only important means of transportation on land other than trains is cars. Therefore, Hitler is sparing no effort to promote the automobile industry. The reason why Germany's automobile industry has reached such a point today is also due to Hitler's support from above and the efforts of the German people from below.</p>
<p>Hitler's plan to support the automobile industry can be divided into three items. One is to make cars economically popular so that everyone in Germany has the possibility of riding in a car. One is to design roads meticulously to maintain safety and extend the life of the car. One is to make the car's parts strong, be practical and realistic, and not be flashy. The initial work is to prevent the import of cars into Germany. All Germans use German cars, and then promote them to other countries to make people know the advantages of German cars and compete with the automobile industries of other countries.</p>
<p>Recently, Hitler has united people in the automobile industry to jointly establish a car factory and hire unemployed workers to manufacture cars. Among the goals he has set, there is a flexible small car named Bangmei Pagmy, which means short and powerful. This car has been widely seen in all parts of Germany, and has also been seen in European countries. It is low in price and good in quality, but the appearance is not rich. However, the general public is happy to buy and use it. On the market in Berlin today, three or four out of every ten cars are this car. The car body shape of this car is very small, and the fuel consumption is very economical. It is suitable for long or short journeys. The high speed can reach 50 miles per hour. Nowadays, European car buyers who want to buy a small car will definitely consider Bangmei cars as their first goal. It can be seen that this car will soon gradually invade the markets of Asia and the Americas from Europe.</p>
<p>Hitler's road plan has been arranged. Every city in Germany can be reached directly by car roads, and there are gas stations all over the road, so there is no need to worry about running out of gas halfway. This project has attracted the attention of rulers of various countries, and the United Kingdom has also started to follow in Hitler's footsteps. Then, Hitler's desire to make Germany's automobile industry dominate the world is within the realm of possibility.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Ford is Pleased to Publish Production Data <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Dearborn, Michigan, July 12th. Today, Henry Ford provided newspaper representatives with the production figures for the first six months of this year and said with a smile, "Recently, my biggest job is to distribute wealth so that the people can use it."</p>
<p>Last November, Ford declared that he would produce "one million or more" cars in 1935. Only half of the year has passed, and the total number of cars produced by Ford Motor Company in the United States and Canada by June 30 has reached 810,700. The number of cars manufactured abroad during the same period was 37,804, for a total of 848,504 units produced worldwide. Someone asked Ford, "When do you hope to exceed the one million unit mark?"</p>
<p>This car manufacturer, who was wearing a tan and noble costume at the time, smiled again and said, "Now, that's another question. I am just a manufacturer, not a prophet. My staff has work to do. This is what our entire organization is grateful for. There are still many things that make us hopeful for the next six months, but we cannot be completely sure. We can only do our best within the scope of what is possible."</p>
<p>Although Ford himself remained silent and made no predictions, Mr. Gao Lin's speech to a Ford dealership in Lichimeng on Tuesday stated that the new slogan "one million or more in 1935" has been adopted. This meeting was one of a series of meetings being convened across the United States. Accompanying Mr. Gao Lin were Heckins, the Deputy Manager of the Sales Department, Hanchi, the Manager of the Lincoln Sales Department, Cooper of Ford Motor Company Limited in the United Kingdom, and Bachowitz, the Business Development Manager of Global Credit Company, a joint education company that sells Ford products.</p>
