<p>本市第十四屆衛生運動大會。巳决定於今日開始舉行。藉登高疾呼之力。予市民惕省之機。其所以利濟人羣者。較之一般運動。實更具深切之意義誠。以時屆夏令。疾病叢生。若不及時防遏。將使滋蔓難圖。而上海為通都繁市。四方人物之所薈萃。尤非有周密之布置。未足以策社會之康寗。此衛生運動所應人人寄與同情。絕對不容漠視者也。</p>
<p>比年以農村破產之故。民生憔悴。已達極點。而悍匪肆虐。水旱成災。尤令鄉氓感無法迴旋之苦。上海一隅。以處境較裕。差免瑣尾之痛。而疫氛所播。亦常使槥木相望於道。實則秋令盛行之疫。為勢雖似凶險。防遏要非甚難。如霍亂赤痢等症。唯一傳染之媒介。卽為蠅蚋。果能嚴密保持食物之淸潔。剷除汚物之暴露。同時復施行預防注射。以提高人身自然抵抗力。卽可絕疫菌之潛滋。謀根本之肅淸。非如猩紅熱腦膜炎之以空氣為傳染者。不易使人預防也。在此人力所能挽回之情勢下。而猶聽其侵染。任其蔓延。寗非人世間一大憾事。此次衛生運動大會所頒行之信條。（一）接受預防注射。（二）要喝煮開的水。（三）不吃不潔的食物。（四）不隨地吐痰。（五）撲滅蒼蠅。皆簡明扼要。確中肯繁。誠能人人深體力行。疫氛之消弭。庶其有望。</p>
<p>本屆衛生運動。視前數屆。又有增進之點。一為舉行廚房比賽。二為組設。衛生勸導員。吾人旣知避免疫氛首在保持食物之淸潔。則廚房之責任。不啻為吾人生命權之掌握者。舉行廚房比賽之意義。卽在喚起廚司對清潔之注意。而獎進其向上之努力。至於一般市民對衛生觀念認識之不淸。要為無可諱飾之事實。今以中小學生為衛生勸導員。使各就能力所及。盡曉喻之責任多。少宜有效果可觀。抑吾人又有進者。衛生運動旣為全市所關。應求普遍之效。中等以上之家戶。知識旣較開明。改良自易就範。至如一般貧民窟中。衣食且感不足。又遑論乎衛生。而實際疫菌之傳布。又往往發源於此中。如何使之有相當之協助。謀切實之改進。是有賴於市政當局之統籌辦理矣。</p>

<p>（巴黎）日前英國政府照會法國、通知英德海軍談記之初步結果、本日午後外長賴伐爾特·與海軍部長庇特利·海軍總參謀長杜朗維埃爾·會商致英國之復文、歷時甚久、聞准許德國海軍噸數等於英國百分之三十五一層、法國政府不至拒絕加以考慮、但在明瞭德國建造海軍之確實程序以前、法國不能有所决定、且德國此項要求、足以引起海軍方面之若干實際問題、此等問題在法國復文內、將逐項加以分析、按德國所要求百分之三十五之比例、不僅適用於海軍總噸數、且亦適用於各級軍艦之噸數、苟然、則此項比例是否係指每年建造新艦之噸數而言、換言之、德國每年造艦是否僅以同時期中英國造艦噸數之百分之三十五爲限、此實爲一亟應明瞭問題、蓋德國所謂百分之三十五之比例、倘係指目前應有之噸數而言、而非分作若干年逐步建造、則對於其他各國將不免發生若干嚴重之問題、良以德國生產能力異常鉅大故也、查華盛頓海軍條約規定、法國所有主力艦應以英國主力艦噸數之百分之三十五爲限、如此種比例繼續保持、則無異承認德國主力艦與法國對等、然法國海岸綫甚長、而其殖民地又散佈世界各地、爲謀特殊安全起見、法國主力艦倘與德國對等、實有未足、法國政府復文中對於此層、擬如何解决、雖所未悉、惟聞此層倘不能成立協定、則德國獲得百分之三十五之比例後、法國建造海軍當自由行動、而不再受華盛頓海約之限制、此外法國迭在軍縮會議提出陸海空軍備應互相聯繫之原則、在對德海軍談判中似亦可適用此項原則、且以爲關於海軍問題似亦可訂結洛迦諾條約簽字國所擬定之天空公約相類之條約、藉以謀切實之解决云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>對德陣綫呈動搖　巴黎輿論深懷疑懼</h3>

<p>威登堡據官方報吿、倫斯道夫城炸藥廠爆炸、殞命者共計五十二人、但據附近各村居民估計、則死亡人數當不止此、按該廠於一九一五年曾有同樣之爆炸事件、當時死亡約五百人、而官方報告則僅有五十人、且昨晚該廠爆炸時、有工人兩班正在廠內工作、可見死亡人數决不止數十人、本日警察環繞倫斯道夫全城、禁止新聞記者赴爆炸地點、有兩新聞記者欲行近該廠、致遭逮捕、拘禁數小時始行釋放、至於爆炸原因尙未明瞭、元首希特勒現已撥欵十萬馬克、救濟被難家屬、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>威登堡昨日午後距此三哩倫斯道夫鎭之威斯特法里安炸藥廠、連炸數坎、據當道佔計、死者約五十人、重傷者七十五人、輕傷者數十人、德國最大最新式之炸藥廠、已因此而毀、附近房屋震倒者甚多、周圍數哩內之玻璃窗無一完整、救傷車奔走數小時、拯救受傷工人、送入一設備不周之醫院、附近各鎭紅十字會之看護與醫土、均往助同救治、據當道報吿、爆炸之原因猶未查明、廠中先起火而繼以爆炸、第一次爆炸、起於午後三時、直至晚八時、炸聲始止、當時聲震遠近、磚石及廠中機器之碎片飛舞於三哩內之天空、廠中之火焰、數哩外能見之、救護隊拯救死傷、危險殊甚、但皆見義勇爲、毫不退縮、現不計親屬視罹禍者、當警察驅走罹禍者之妻孥與母親時、其景狀之慘、目不忍覩、最初暄傳死者在五百人至一千五百人之間、後經查明、當肇禍時、廠中工作者僅三百人、（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>意國吞阿雄心　現正計畫夷爲保護國俎上肉寗容他國染指阿境意庶民紛紛他徙</h3>
<p>（羅馬）據可靠方而消息、意大利現正計畫將阿比西尼亞夷爲保護國、按照其計盡阿王薩拉西之王位可保無虞、另一可靠消息、阿國願意將目今成爲時局糾紛之亞喀大割與意大利、併入意屬索謀里蘭之版圖、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）外國方面傳說意大利擬於八月二十五日國聯會行政院開會時、提議將阿比西尼瓜分爲英法意三國之保護國、並以阿國亞喀大省劃歸意國云云、官方頃加以否認、並謂意國駐英大使格蘭第頃在此間、幷未携有英國關於意阿爭端之任何建議、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿此西尼京　阿國境內意大利僑民大部份已離開阿境、前往意屬伊里特里地方、餘衆則亦凖備於下月中旬啟程阿國政府爲避免發生事端起見、已令各省省長遇必要時、派兵保衛阿國內地之歐洲僑民、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據此間快報羅馬通訊員報吿、謂彼曾與墨索里尼談話、墨氏云、阿比西尼亞問題不久卽可獲得適當解决、意大利近來爲預防事伴之擴大計、曾採軍事行動、然現已願將華爾華爾事件付之公斷、惟墨氏表示不容忽視者、卽阿國軍隊自一九二九年來、已得歐洲各國軍官之訓練另成新軍、故其對於意屬殖民地之威脅不獨非暫時性質、且其危險性亦將與日俱增也、意大利爲一具有組織能力及維持和平之國家、此事可以利比亞之現局爲明證、最後墨氏聲言、東菲問題關鍵全恃歐洲各國之熊度、及其對意大利是否具有眞摯友誼一點爲轉移云、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）報界之反英運動、過去數星期中甚爲熱烈、現因英國對於意大利阿比西尼亞之爭執、採取保留態度、逐漸趨沉寂、一般人咸信英國之採取保留態度、實受法國之影響、此間政界對此表示滿意、並乘機宣稱、意國之行動决不弱英國在紅海方面之勢力云、又悉英政府如避免干涉、則意政府大概不致拒絕談判劃分勢力範圍問題、惟目今所傳談判業已進行之說尙無從證實、（十三日國民電）</p>

<h3>紗織業　危機益深刻　華商紗廠莫不虧折　日商各廠均獲鉅利</h3>
<p>我國紗廠因受市面不景氣及外紗傾銷影響、以致營業衰落减工停工、巳成普遍之病態、日商紗廠獨能獲利、據紗業消息、日商同興紗廠、本年四月底止、上半期之損益、計獲利七十三萬二千元、其原因為該廠出品之四十支雙綫及細布、頗合市面需要、本期計紡紗二萬零八百包、織棉布四十五萬一千七百疋、該廠滬地計有二廠、共有紗錠九萬八千枚、綫錠三萬零二百四十枚、因於前年改用常伸制及織機之自動化、故生產效率激增、成本减低、同時該廠擬於靑島增設分廠、預定紡錠三萬枚織機一千一百五十台、目下正建造廠基、所有機器、已向本國訂購、此外日華等廠、亦均能獲利、華商各紗廠雖欲增進生產效率、惟格於經濟、故無法與其競爭循此以往華商紗織各廠、勢必盡為日商所打倒、其危機實不敢設想也、</p>

<h3>招商局　交涉香港客牌成功　港政府承認我國船員證書　從此與各國船員同等待遇　為我航政史上空前之創舉</h3>
<p>香港輪船客牌出給綦嚴、非經港政府認為船身優美、及高級船員須用洋員充任者、卽不能得到香港客牌、招商局去年新建之四海輪、因請求客牌、港政府須令四船船長及大二副輪機長等、全用外籍船員方可發給、交涉經半年之久、未得同意、招商遂憤而放棄香港搭客、寗受營業損失、不願聘用洋人、免損國家主權與威信、一面則呈請中央向港政府交涉力爭、昨奉外部電令、香港當局已容納我方請求、承認我國船員證書、准予給發乘客執照、在我國航運史上値得大書特書之空前創舉、從此華輪赴港、中國船員待遇與歐美各國一律、故卽籌備七月一日起、各海輪開始出售香港客票、亟詰其原委如下、</p>
<p>港政府始堅拒</p>
<p>招商局自海元海亨海利海貞落成開班後、祇海元一船、因用外籍船長及船員、故香港港務局給發乘客牌照、其他海亨海利海貞三船、因用國人船長、及高級船員客牌、概不給發、經招商局一再交涉力爭、港政府表示最小限度、華人船長船員、須由香港理船廳考過、如能合格、方可發給客牌、對於我國交通部航政局所發船員證書、概不承認、因之局內對於此事、經過數度會議、寗可放棄香港搭客、不能遷就而用外籍船員、自損權利、一面呈請中央、請外交部向英政府交涉力爭、故六個月來海亨海貞海利、始終未搭香港乘客、以待中央交涉之結果耳、</p>
<p>據約力爭成功</p>
<p>局內奉到交部命令、統計每船每年僅香港一埠、客脚損失約七八萬元、而於所訂中英庚欵條約之回付本息不符、故無論如何、必須使四海輪同售港票、乃諮請外部、從速力爭、外部除一面電令駐英公使向倫敦英政府交涉外、同時乃電請兩廣之西南外交特派員、就近赴港與港政府交涉、引用我國已經加入九國海上安全公約、卽為國際海上安全公約要員之一、則我國所簽發之船員證書、與各國船員證書、同一有效、香港政府無否認之理由、經西南外交特派員向港政府力爭結果、港政府乃完全容納我國要求、准予承認、</p>
<p>港府容我主張</p>
<p>外部接到該特派員電告與港政府交涉力爭經過、謂香港政府已對於我方主張完全容納、自本年七月一日起、香港港務尼、於我國交通部及航政局所簽發之船員證書、准與英國政府簽發之船員設書、認為有同等效力、從七月一日起、凡執有中國政府（卽交部航政局）簽發證書之船員、充任船長及高級船員者、已可與各國船員受同等待遇、不受港政府之任何限制、且華人船主之輪船、亦可乘搭旅客、更無絲毫拘束、特通知招商局查照、</p>
<p>七月起售港票</p>
<p>招商局奉到此令後、以香港客牌問題、已得圓滿解决、而華人船員證書、得與世界各國儕列於同等地位、尤為我國航政史上破天荒之成功、實與國輪業前途有莫大之利益、深望國人船員此後愼重職責、永維此令譽地位、同時海貞海利海亨三船之香港客票、决自七月一日起、開始發售、一面向港政府禰領客牌、一面於本局客票股籌辦三海輪售賈港票手續矣、</p>

<p>代表請願　財部現定之交易所稅、决自七月一日開始實行、其徵稅辦法、以標金證稅獨重、較雜糧麵粉證券紗布等稅率、超過幾及二十倍、因其他交易稅計算標凖、係照佣金十分之一、而標金每條佣金三分一釐半、徵稅竟達六分、幾及佣金二倍、故於昨晨十時、金業經紀人公會、特派代表詹連生·王家福·高秋眉·王盈昌·余毓洪·董再生·翁念劬·等十六人、備文至西愛咸斯路財長孔祥熙私邸請願、適財長公出未遇、乃折返至中央銀行、當由財部總務司長許建屏代見、代表當要求减低、并緩徵、許氏答復、允轉陳財長核奪、</p>
<p>召集會議　該交易所經紀人公會、以財部所定開徴日期已近、能否蒙當局接受、尙難逆料、惟經紀人本身為自身利益起見、故定日內召開全體經紀人會議、報告請願經過、及此後之方針、必要時、將派代表晋京、向中央請願、冀以達减低及緩徵之目的、</p>

<p>大會總幹事胡昌治、昨發表本屆之衛生運動意義云、集合本市各團體各機關、以及民衆的力量、十四屆衛生運動在今天開始、衛生運動是一種形式或是宣傳、從這宣傳發生極大的力量、產生實際的衛生工作、這次衛生運動、除了促進民衆健康建立民族外、還含有二種重大的意義、（一）近代物質文明的向上、使歐美先進國家的衛生事業走上了最健全的路、就美國的醫藥而論、有十四萬正式的醫師、四十餘萬的護士、十三萬的藥劑師、九十萬具醫院病牀、服務於醫藥界的專家竟達一百餘萬、但是返顧吾國、全國醫師只有五千人、醫院和醫學專家、更是寥寥無幾、兩相對比、我國衛生事業的落後、是很明顯的事實、衛生事業的前進或是落後、頗足表現社會文化的高下、因此這次衛生運動其所含有的最高意義、就是提高我國的文化水凖、（二）在這二十世紀科學昌明時代、醫藥與衛生已由封建的進展至科學的時期、可是在我國醫卜星相在醫藥界仍佔着極大的勢力、這些封建的餘孽、還緊緊握住着一般民衆的信仰、但是從這次衛生運動起、我們要建立起民衆新的信仰、新的科學的信仰、</p>

<p>上海市第十四屆衛衛運動特刊</p>
<h3>上海市第十四屆衛生運動大會特刊辭</h3>
<p>— 李廷安</p>
<p>衛生運動的意義就是作大規模的衛生宣傳，將處種衛生常識，灌輸到一般民衆的心目中。使能澈底了解衛生的意義，增進健康，卽是强我國家，又卽是强我民族，本年第十四屆衛生運動大會，市衛生局深認欲得很大的功效必要與各界合作所以聯合租界衛生當局和本市二十餘機關團體分工合作，於六月十五日開幕了。查本市衛生事業，逐年進步，所以運動大會的精神，也是一年比一年興奮。今年又把戒烟戒毒，也併在衛生運動之內，同時官傳。展覽會場內，關於衛生方面的各種標本，模型，圖表，以及書報刊物等等，無不盡量收集，公開閱覽，希望全體市民都能認識，認識之後，還要身體力行下邊兩件事，一方面實行種種的個人衛生方法，一方面互助公共衛生的進展。該會為普遍宣傳起見，特約本市各大報編印特刊，因將所以要舉行衛生運動大會的綠故，略說幾句，以告讀者。</p>
<h3>爲舉行衛生運動大會敬告市民</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>今天舉行衛生運動會謹將關於衛生的重要意義，作一簡單說明，希望各界市民予以注意。</p>
<p>近年來，無論何處民衆之稍有知識的幾乎都已曉得衛生這個名詞，但是對於衛生的意義，有正確認識者，仍是不多，一般人都當衛生二字是一個很時髦的新名詞，把他冠於事物名稱之上，以求取巧，甚且利用他以廣招徠，但是往往名不符實，一部份沒有知識的窮苦人，有時勸他們講衛生，他們會說：「我們都沒有得吃，還講什麼衛生！」有一部份老年人，更會對人說：「我們何曾講過什麼衛生，也活到這麼大歲數了！」這些人都沒有明瞭衛生的眞義；其實人都是好生惡死，喜歡健康無病的，那能否認衛生的重要呢！</p>
<p>「衛生」二字簡言之就是「保衛生命」，或「維持健康」的意義，世間萬物大別為二，一是生物，一是無生物，有生物又分為動物與植物二大類，不論他為動物或植物，都有「生命」「繁殖」之本能，但皆不能軼出「新陳代謝」與「優勝劣敗」「適者生存」之天演公例，所以凡是生物，皆有生死，在其生存期問，必定都須能發揮其「保衛生命」之固有本能，以求適應環境，方能生活，卽使他是一個原蟲或細菌身體的構造祇是一個單細胞，亦必須具有此種本能，才能生活，不過生活情形簡單的其保衛生命之本能亦極簡單，生活情形複雜的，其保衛生命之本能愈複雜，此僅就專靠「本能」來保衛生命的生物而言，若講到人類之保衛生命，尤其是現代的人類，那就不是這樣簡單。</p>
<p>生物中生活情形，動物較為複雜，植物較為簡單，其保衛生命之本能，亦當然以動物爲較複雜，人類富於理性，居動物中之最高等地位，亦卽爲生物中之最特出者，其保衛生命之本能當然</p>
<p>現代人口日益稠密，似乎人與獸類之競爭已經過去，而人與人之競爭方烈，但實際上人與人之競爭尙易設法避免所應請注意而成問題者，則為目力所小能之異類害敵，卽病原微生物（病原蟲，病菌）此類害敵，幾乎無時不環視吾側乘機進攻，以我們人體富他們的殖民地，結果是吸取吾人脂膏，斵喪吾人性命，其殘暴蹂躪之酷毒實較巨形之槍砲，有過之無不及，故吾人衛生之方法决不能專恃極節單之本能，我們人類，應站在同一戰綫上用妥善的方法與此害敵（病原微生物）作戰，謀一最後勝利，若廿自暴棄不加抵抗防範，則此等么微小醜終將得寸進尺，而最特出之生物，反有為最下等生物所殺戮之危險。</p>
<p>衛生運動是每年循例舉行的，若不注意已往之陳跡，現在之實况以及將來之希望，可說是多此，一舉，毫無用處，所以我們要抱定苟日新日日新又日新的宗旨去做，把過去與現在的成續比較一下，並預定將來改善之目標，那才有進步。</p>

<h3>衛生運動與民族復興</h3>
<p>— 陸京士</p>
<p>一個民族之衰盛，自其表面觀之，固在乎國家武備之完缺與夫人民智識之明昧，而實際言之，則又歸結於該民族對於自然爭存之能力如何，此中消息證諸東西洋各民族間盛衰之歷史而益明，試觀歐洲當中世以前，希臘羅馬、本其崇尙威武與夫爭勝之精神，堅貞勇敢，不屈不撓，卒以建立世界上文明進化之古國，及其衰也，則又導源於奢靡淫佚之侵潤，婦女鳩酒之沉緬，而與自然爭存能力之消失，實為其間唯一之原因也。以言吾國，唐虞二代，具無論矣，卽漢唐二代之人民，亦何嘗不具有勇往邁進赴湯蹈火之精神，不顧一切悍然有所作為，故卒能蕩滌外來民族之壓迫，建立東亞偉大帝國之聲威，其與自然爭存之能力，比之希臘羅馬，誠無讓也。唯自趙宋以來，偃武修文，巽耎苟安之風習，遂深中於全民族之各個份子間，日進月盛，而吾民族與自然爭存之能力，乃漸次消失，終以引起外來民族之侵襲，歷遼金元淸四代，而迄無恢復之徵象，是故宋明以來之理學家，若周稈張朱以迄王陽明陸象山諸先輩，其為學修德之要者，蓋無不揭示居敬窮理四字，居敬所以强身，窮理所以明智，蓋亦求興復吾民族對於自然爭存之能力也。然以痼疾已深，積重難反，雖經六七百之呼號倡導，猶未能在全民族間顯其針砭之效，迄乎淸末，而西洋列强又藉其資本金融船堅砲利之勢，乘虛侵入彫零敝疲之中國，民族復與之運動，一方保存吾民族固有之知能，一方吸收他民族特有之專長，而以恢復民族與自然爭存之能力為其努力之唯一方向，近年以還國家對於國民體格之豭鍊，公私衛生之改進，蓋皆本此方向直接以求國民體力之增進，間接以求爭存能力之提高也，唯終以人才財力之關係，不能作普這廣大之運動，使整個民族之各個份子皆得有充分之了解與遵行之决心，實為憾事，今上海市衛生局獨能注意於此，而有衛生運動大會之舉，裨益民族，誠非淺解，欣慰所至，故敢逞其腷意，發為狂論焉</p>

<h3>教部鍾督學視察　冀省職教報告</h3>
<p>教部督學鍾道贊視察河北職業敎育報告摘要如下</p>
<p>該省職業敎育經費、在二十二年度只占全省中等敎育經費百分之六·九、與部定標準相差甚遠、自二十三年度裁減過量之師範班級、將其餘欵移充職業學校之用、於是職業教育、漸有基礎、預計至二十六年度可達到百分之二十五、查該省現有省立農業職業學校二所、省立工業職業學校二所、省立商業職業學校一所、省立商學院與在津中學附設之商業職業科五班、省立水產專科學校之水產職業科二班、以及正在籌備中之石門工業職業學校、此外天津市立師範職業、爲數亦復不少、核其內容、如工業學院職業科之設備完善、保定工業職業學校之尙著成績、省立易縣農業職業學校及市立師範職業科之努力辦理、高陽私立染織職業學校之與工廠合作、獲鹿縣立染織學校之注重工作、均屬認眞切實、頗有希望、惟多數縣私立職業學校、設備既多簡單、辦理又未完等、即揆之各核地實際需要、亦多不合、茲將視察意見、列舉如左、</p>
<p>一、該省對於職業師資訓練、擬一面由廳遴選大學或各科畢業生若干名、一面令各職業學校、就其實際需要、保送原有教員若干名、由廳分別介紹省內外各工廠或試騐機關研究一二年、以增進技能、費用由廳供給、辦法甚是、惟就利用假期、講習關於教學管理之科目、以求妥善、</p>
<p>二、該省省立職業學校、仍收少量之學費、對於學校經費、事實上並無甚裨益、反足以阻碍有志職業青年之求學、應予取消、</p>
<p>三、該省職業學校經常費標準、初級已照規定提高、高級尙未辦到、致學校甚感困難、應視工農商各科性質、分別予以增加、</p>
<p>四、各職業學校實習雖多已較前增加、惟因時間之限制、與學習內容之繁重、不能獲得熟練之技能、應卽通令各校關於職業學科實習之時數、務必遵照規定辦理、並訂定暑假實習辦法、尅期施行、以資補救、</p>
<p>五、該省推行職敎方案、業經本部核准備案、應依照原案、將師範裁减、節餘經費、充實原有職校及添設新校之用、無得藉詞變更、致碍進行、</p>
<p>六、唐山為河北工業區域、應斟酌環境情形、設置最切需要之工業職業學校、及職業補習學校、</p>
<p>七、工業學院職業部、辦理甚為得法惟細究其製品之複雜部分、尙多出於工匠之手、學生僅學習其方法、技術似欠嫻熟、應實行假期作業集中練習、同時仍照該校原定辦法、每年選擇各班優秀畢業生若干人、留校繼續研究、以資深造、</p>
<p>八、工業學院職業部應化科之皮件製作、向僱校外工人承辦、應參照機工科藝徒班辦法、招收藝徒、學習製作、</p>
<p>九、法商學院商業職業科、天津中學商科、原應合併省立天津商業職業學校辦理、因事實困難、仍歸原校辦至原有學生畢業為止、自無不可、惟實習時間及設備、商品研究、中西文打字·經濟·商情·調查及廣告術等之實際工作、都不充分、應予改善、普通功課如生物學外國地理、每週各三小時應刪初級職業班、並須注意書法、商業圖畫、珠算及明瞭舊式記賬方法、以切實用、</p>
<p>十、私立天津弘德、這惠之商業學校、學生均甚發達、畢業後多從事於外籍商行及銀行郵局職務、升學者約居百分之三十以上、外國語國文過量注重、實際上能用其所學者甚少、再查各該校對於學科、專重講授、無調查研究參觀及實習之設施、應予改善、</p>
<p>十一、省立天津商業學校普通商業科之歷史·英文·國文及會計科之軍訓·代數·幾何等之敎授時數、均嫌太多、應予酌减、每週上課總時數宜酌加、校舍租用民房、狹窄不能擴充、應設法遷移、</p>
<p>十二、省立水產專科學校職業科第一二學年甚少實習、漁撈科第六學期有一二月之海上練習、餘均在校內實騐室工作、據云、學生不能耐苦、應利用假期實習、養成刻苦習慣、又查該校為預備學生升學起見、特加多數學鐘點、亦為不合、校址遷移問題、亦應遵令迅予解决、</p>
<p>十三、省市立女子師範學院家政系及專修科、辦理尙有成績、惟（一）課程支配、似偏重圖畫·音樂、對於兒童心理·衛生·看護·家庭科學·食物化學等、均須多加注意、敎育行政一科宜刪、（二）應注重各種經濟能力不同的家庭之研究、為個案之探討、家政實習、亦應多注意於中下階級家庭問題之解决以及如何改良、（三）家政實習、應多注竟於調查參觀及實際家庭之見習、勿徒為校內之工作、（四）應利用設備添設高級家政職業科遇必要時酌授師範科目、以養成小學勞作敎員、</p>
<p>十四、省立保定高級工業職業學校、歷史悠久、設備頗佳、惜多係舊式機械每欠精確、亟應添置新式機械、學生實習技術、亦未嫻熟、須實行假期作業、各科敎學認眞、所編講義、經多年修正、尙稱合用、可擇尤出版、以供他校之參考、該校原有女生班級、去年停止招生、查河北全省尙缺女子職業學校、保定鄰縣多以染織為普通家庭生產事業、應予續招、該校現有十叫班學生只領十三班經費、辦理感覺困雜、應照班次核給經費、否則歸併班次、</p>
<p>十五、省立易縣與黃村農業職業學校、成立不久、成績未著、易縣農林二塲、環境甚佳、面積亦大、進展甚有希望、惟該校計劃增至十班、實際上一年級學生衆多、二三年級漸少、四五年級更少、為顧全事實計、應令騰出一部份經費、為實施農民補習敎育及推廣工作之用、不必呆板招足十班、黃村農塲較小、設施困難、一切耕種及農產製造工具、均異常缺之、應將該校積二千餘元、全部充實內容、並仍應注重假期實習、地現·歷史二學科可刪、實習時間應增添、二校校舍均不敷用、自宜修建、惟應以簡樸堅固爲主、節省經費、爲增添教學設備之用、</p>
<p>十六、天津市立師範職業師範科、分儀器標本與家庭工藝兩組、各分前後期職業師範、除職業學科每週十二至十四小時外、前期餘爲普通學科、後期餘爲教育與普通學科、分配不甚適當、應將前三年以半數時間、從事職業訓練、餘爲普通學科、後三年職業訓練、仍占二分之一、其餘半數時間、普通與教育學科各半、如是技術精熟、旣可爲小學勞作科師資、亦可爲初級或補習職業學校師資、</p>
<p>十七、市立第三十五小學初級木工職業班、適合環境需要、學生實習精神甚佳、教學進度及時間分配、亦尙合理、惟為適應環境要求起見、第三學年可加授普通建築常識、年限亦得酌矛延長、高級小學部原設之木工勞作組、仍宜恢復、使志願入木工班者、作初步基礎之練習、並應注意作物之精確、製圖繪圖等能力習慣之養成、同時須遂漸運用新工具方法及式樣、以求技能之時代性、</p>
<p>十八、高陽私立初級染織職業學校、規模不大、所有設備、足敷三班學生實習之用、高年級學生常往校外染織廠實習、獲得實地經騐、畢業生亦尙有出路、惟每月經費無固定收入、全恃商會籌措、維持甚感困難、該廳應依照規定、酌予補助、以資鼓勵、該校附設之小學、畢業後大多數升入職業班、為增進效率起見、可就高小年級、每週予以五六小時之染織基本練習、與此校辦理情形相似之獲鹿縣立染織學校、該廳亦應予以相當之資助、</p>
<p>十九、該省縣立初級職業學校或班、共有二十三處、除高陽獲鹿二校外、多屬簡陋、該廳擬定之整理辦法、應速實施、以求改進、</p>

<h3>橡實真空管九五四號</h3>
<p>— 庸言</p>
<p>橡實眞空管九五四號（Acorn　tube954），是繼九五五號三極管而產生的超短波用五極管。</p>
<p>九五四號因須供在超短波長時作射電週率放大之用，設計時極間電容量力求其小，屏極自管頂接出，控制棚極自管底接出，屏橺間電容量僅〇·〇〇七粉粉法拉特（當用特備之遮隔板），故在〇·七公尺之波長上·尙能工作。</p>
<p>九五四號的大與九五五號</p>
<p>相彷，各極的接法及其外形如圖，量大高度一又十六分之十一英寸，直徑一又三十二分之三英寸。因其體積甚小，故又可作種種利用，如用於眞空管電壓表。及電容器式傳話器（Condenser　Miorophone）之前級放大器中。九五四號不但宜於射電週率放大，又可作檢波式或成音週率放大：更可因接法之不同，以作三極四極與五極管之用。使用時項配特製之管座。其特性如下：</p>
<p>絲極電壓（交流或直流）　六·三弗打</p>
<p>絲極電流　〇·一五安培</p>
<p>甲類放大時之屏壓　二五〇弗打</p>
<p>簾橺壓　一〇〇弗打</p>
<p>控制柵壓　負三弗打</p>
<p>掩蔽橺極接至陰極（在管座上）</p>
<p>放大係數　大於二〇〇〇</p>
<p>互導一四〇〇漠</p>
<p>屏極電流　二份安培</p>
<p>簾橺電流　〇·份安培</p>
<p>檢波時，與五七或六〇六特性相彷。</p>
<h3>無綫電筆</h3>
<p>— 泡</p>
<p>無綫電的新用途日有發展，從最初的無綫電報逐漸推進而有無綫電話，再進而有電視，這是無綫電正支的發展。此外旁及的用途更屆指難數，譬如指探無人駕駛的飛機或輪船，傳遞電力，醫治某種疾病，剿殺有害昆虫等等。「無綫電筆」亦為其中的一種，</p>
<p>「無綫電筆」（Catbautograph　or　radio　pen）是美國第夢德（Allen　B．Dumont）所發明、，曾在美國電氣無綫電展覽會中公開試騐，由紐約電氣聯合會主席勞伍（Clarence　L．Law）用機中特備的金屬筆在機前的小板上振筆作書，會塲的另一角的一幅特別的幕上，就有綠色的同樣的字出現。</p>
<p>甲圖中可見第氏正在使用其無綫電筆，以手提機前特備的金屬筆在機前的小板上寫字，機上方的圓幕上就有同樣的字出現；同時在遠處的另一圓幕上，亦受控制而照樣有字出現。原理請看乙圖，機中的金屬筆連在一根筆臂上，筆臂上連有一接觸點在置成直角的二組綫繞耗阻器上前後左右滑動：若此耗阻器上通有電流，則接觸點上卽可得相當於金屬筆移動的變動電壓：此種變動電壓經過發射，由遠處的接收機接收後，加於陰極管的偏折屏（Dellection　plate）上，以控制其電子流（卽陰極光）；此受控制之電子流射向管中特備的磷光圓幕上，就產生綠色的同樣的字跡來了</p>
<p>這種無綫電筆有一缺點，就是圓幕上的字跡不能久留，大概寫至第十一字時，第一字卽逐漸褪淡而不見，故原發明人尙在繼續研究中，以求字跡之久留</p>
<p>無綫電筆與電視除利用陰極光綫的一部份相同外，其餘完全不同；與「傳眞電報」亦不相同，因為除以電子流產生字跡外，其他並不與光學發生關係。</p>
<h3>蘇聯業餘無綫電的現狀（續）</h3>
<p>— 嚴善志</p>
<p>在蘇聯的業餘者，可以分爲第一級、第二級、第三級三種。第三級的業餘者，也就是初級的人，要能够每分鐘收總十個字（五十個字母）的無綫電符號，知道通信的手續，和無綫電一般的原理，但生產工業的從事者和特種團體的會員。則只要一分鐘收聽六個字（三十個字母）左右就行了。天綫的電力，只允許二十華脫，使用波長也只五公尺，十公尺，四十公尺和八十公尺等幾種，在使用四十公尺的時候，通信時間只能在莫斯科標準鐘點的零時（十二時）到次晨八時，而且發射的音調一定要此別的波長好，但是別的波長，是沒有這樣限制的。這一種。約佔全國業餘者百分之六</p>
<p>業餘者的第二級，或說是中級的，要考些比初級較深的無綫電學，以及電學的基本知識，收聽技術也到每分鐘十六個字（九十個字母），假使是生產工業的從事者，或特種團體的會員，一分鐘千個字（五十個字母）也就可以了。天綫電力能用到四十華脫，使用波長有五公尺，十公尺，四十公尺，八十公尺，一百六十公尺等。假使得到「短波部中央局」的特許，也可以使用二十公尺這一波長，他們可以不受時間和電力供給的限制，這一級的業餘者，約佔全國五分之四。</p>
<p>第一級的業餘者，就是高級的考試課目，際了第二親所考的課目以外。還有眞空管的基礎知識，眞空管的特性，關於Parameter及晶體運用，其他如電動機，發電機，內燃機等各方面的事情也都要經過考試。如果要從事無綫電話，還要考調幅，以及無綫電話機方面的知識，屬於這一級的業餘者，約佔全國百分之十四。使用波長有五公尺，十公尺，二十公尺，四十公尺，八十公尺，及一百六十公尺等幾種。天綫電力也能增到一百華脫。通信時間也沒有什麼限制。而且這種業餘者，還有參加全國極重要的遠地探險的科學遠征隊和當「無綫電之友會」組織的無綫電科目的敎授的權利。（待續）</p>

<p>出版界</p>
<h3>上海與內地</h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>上海在一方面是個國際的都市，資本帝國主義的魔手，卽由此而伸入我內地；同時，在他方面他却是我國政治經濟及出版界的中心，居着領導的地位。因了這種上海的特性，於是造成上海在我國民經濟政治及文化上的畸形的存在。即上海愈發展繁榮，內地愈衰落枯竭，然而上海到底有賴內地資源的營養以長成，因了內地農村經濟的破產，上海卒來了空前的不景氣。這是就上海與內地的經濟關係言。</p>
<p>因為上海這種經濟上的優勢，再加帝國主義列强勢力的保育，於是不僅經濟上，甚至在政治上也隱隱支配了我國內地，外國洋行的買辦這樣由高等華人成為我們今日的政治家。從前是「學優而仕」，現在是由商而官。「舉優而仕」不免「兩袖淸風」，由商而官遂一行作吏，便「腰纏萬貫」。這是政治的商業化，也是中國內地的上海化，上海給與我國政治上的影響蓋如此。</p>
<p>至於文化上，則就出版界言，其能免於洋涇浜型之譏者，實在幾希。古書洋裝，成了流行，這且不說，如在敎科用書以及定期刮物中，究竟有百分之幾是代表着中國的國民意識，我們實在難言。在上海，我們是「沒有了中國」，在上海的出版界中，中國是也正在一天天的趨於消滅。然而這樣的出版界，却為我國的領導者，正為內地的出版界所亦步亦趨的追隨着。這是値得我們的注意的。</p>
<p>上海的洋涇浜文化，其所以能普及於內地，一種原因是由於戲劇與電影的敎育，一種是由於交通的便利與接觸的頻繁；還有則由於出版物的宣傳。於是欲言「摩登」，便非上海化不可了。</p>
<p>就出版界言，這種表面的校仿，莫過於蔑視空間的不同。因為上海是居於全國中心的地位，故其出版物之具有國際性或全國性，是當然的。反之，內地的出版物，因其性質為地方的，理應有所不同。然而事實，內地的出版物，言時事者莫不以東方雜誌為模範，談文藝者俱以小說月報為典型。結果，不僅喪失了內地刊物地方的特殊性，且就內容而論，亦刻鵠類驚，不及遠甚。在經濟，時間及能力上，遺是何等的浪費啊！</p>
<p>最近到杭州，看見了一種「浙江青年」的月刋，能夠注意於浙江的歷史，物產，經濟等等的敘述，我覺得這個編輯方法是值行推薦於內地的出版界的。</p>
<p>（註）「浙江靑年」，係浙省敎育廳編輯發行。</p>
<h3>請胡適出思想界去</h3>
<p>— 葉靑</p>
<p>胡適在「獨立評論」第一三五號上發表了一篇文章，呌做「今日思想界的一個弊病」。我讀過後，覺得有駁斥必要。這自然不是為誰辯謹，我是發表我的意見。</p>
<p>胡適在這篇文章裏的根本意思是反對抽象的學術名詞的使用。他以為種種制度，種種思想，「各有很長的歷史，各有它的歷史演變的事實，都是具體的東西，都不能用一個抽象名詞來解釋它們，形容它們或概括它們。」因此，封建主義，資本主義，自由，等名詞，是不可用的。如果用了，便是「濫用名詞」，「在思想上，它造成懶惰籠統的思想習慣；在文字上，它造成鏗鏘空洞的八股文章。這都是中國幾千年的文字障的遺毒」，「不是可以忽視的毛病」。今天的思想界，應該把它除去纔好。</p>
<p>這種見解，完全證明胡適沒有「受過一點嚴格的思想訓練」，甚至運論理學常識都沒有。我們不止說話，作文就是認識，都根本少不了普通名詞和抽象名詞。認識離不得概念，是我在「張東蓀哲學批判」一書（辛墾初版E四一九至二三，四二八至三一）一說得很明白的。所以表示概念的普通名詞和抽象名詞，為認識所不可少。說話和作文亦然。胡適那篇文章中不是包含有很多抽象名詞如「思想」，「封建制度」，「自由主義的文化」，等等麼？</p>
<p>我們對於事物的認識，是從個別到分類以至綜合。由於認識個別的事物，所以有專門名詞。由於分類衆多的事物，所以有普通名詞。在認識了桃樹，李樹，……之後，我們要把它們歸入一類，定名為「樹」，以別於草本，木本等。由此遞進，我們要得出包有最高概念的粽合名詞呌做「物」的來。所謂抽象名詞，就是行為方面的普通名詞。譬如「資本主義」，便是種種具體的經濟行為分類的結果。它有一定的內容。所謂籠統，是相對的。而行為方面的認識，也是由個別到分類至於綜合，達到最高的抽象。</p>
<p>人類的認識，完全是專門名詞和普通名詞，具體名詞和抽象名詞互為說明的作用。假如我拿個蘋果問胡先生這是甚麼，你一定說蘋果是一種果，形圓，味甜，……。假如我問果是甚麼，你一定說果是形圓，味甜，例如蘋果。因此，對於人類行為的說明，不能拒絕名詞的使用。</p>
<p>這些認識或表達認識的法則，是不分古今，不分中外都一樣的。胡適不知道它們，根本就不該在思想界內說話。乃他不止不知道他們為思想所不可少，反加以詆毀誣為「中國幾千年的文字障」，不很可笑嗎？這種見解，不僅是「今日思想界的一偭大弊病」；而且它的發表，還實在是今日思想界的一個大恥辱呢！胡先生，請你出思想界去好些吧。</p>
<p>確實，胡適應該退出今日的思想界纔是。第一，他反對抽象名司有很久的時間。頭次在一九一九年（看他的「文存」一集二卷P，一八九至九〇）；二次在一九二八年（前書三集P，九一至一〇七）。由一九一九年到三次一九三五年這十七年中，沒有一點進步。第二，前兩次的謬論，我巳經批評過了，看我的「胡適批判」（辛墾初版）六八一至六九八等頁便可知道。然而今天他還要來無駁議地舊話重提，毫沒有一點考慮別人的批判的表示。這不是他死不進步，死不覺悟的證明嗎？像這樣的人，不退出思想界做甚麼？</p>
<p>老實說，胡適是文藝稪興時代的人，他只曉得但丁，巧叟的國語文學和倍根的科學方法。此後的東西，他一無所知。像資本主義，帝國主義，社會主義，種種名詞，他便莫明其妙了。要批評，他又不懂，所以只好看作「名教」來反對。若果眞是抽象名詞要不得，那他為甚麼還講實騐主義，科學方法這一些抽象名詞呢？像這樣的智識落伍者，不該退出思想界麼？</p>
<p>自然，我也知道胡適的作用還沒有完結。雖是他在一九一九年為資本主義用反對抽象名詞的。口實攻打當時輸人之革命的理想（主義）：在一九二八年為帝國主義用反對抽象名詢的口實攻打當時一些革命的標語：然而在一九三五年，還有為個人主義文化再用反對抽象名詞的口實來攻打社會主義術語，或方法的必要。大槪一天革命尙未成功，胡適的反革命作用都不會完結。然而我們這有推動歷史之責的人，是應該請他退出思想界去的。</p>
<p>休矣胡適！你不認識時代，時代也不認識你，走開吧，莫要障礙人家的前進！</p>
<h3>介紹兩本研究文化問題的書籍</h3>
<p>— 周毓英</p>
<p>文化的研究謝頌羔著上海廣學會出版定價五角文化進化論　鍾兆麟譯世界書局出版定價二元</p>
<p>一年來，文化問題在中國眞是風起雲湧，特別的引人注意，所有的學者，作家，以至於大大小小的敎授們，要是見了人不說幾句文化長文化短的話，總好像有些落伍，不時髦之嫌。當然，愛談文化，並不是一件壞事情，但抱着膚淺的應時的觀念去胡說亂講，那却害人不淺。</p>
<p>自從文化問題引人注意後，便有人提倡「文化學」的建立，這的確是當前的急務。因為文化問題若不趕快成立一個科學化的系統出來，研究的人總覺得有茫無頭績，無從說起之苦。文化問題若能產生了一種科學，研究起來就可以有一定的系統和方法了。但是現在的中國，文化問題的研究還是很幼稚的，講談文化問題的人雖然很多，所談的內容恐怕一半是文不對題，還有一半是大家互相雷同，瑣碎重複，還不如不談的好。</p>
<p>這裏，我想提出兩本書來，推薦從熱心研究文化問題的先生們。一本是鐘兆鱗譯的一文化進化學」，一本美謝頌羔著的「文化的研究」。這兩本書，雖不能說是文化科學的完璧，可是在這一個文化問題急待論，而專著却一本都找不着，有這兩本書，也可說是沙漢中的甘霖了。據記者所見到的，什麼東洋文化史西洋文化史以及什麼文化小史一類的書籍，眞是多得很，一時要找出一二十種是不感困難的。但這種什麼什麼史，都是各憑主觀的叙述，絕對我不出一個合理的共同的標準。能够保有着科學化的精神，對文化問題加以普遍而深切的研究的，我想恐怕就祇有這兩本了。</p>
<p>「文化的研究」一書，最便於初次研究文化問題的去閱讀。牠是由淺人深，而且文句都非常淺顯明白，容易讀，容易了解。全書分上下兩卷，上卷為「文化的發展」，下卷為「文化的商榷」。上卷討論文化的發展現象，以及在發展過程中與各種社會組織科學進化等等的關係。下卷討論中國目前的及一般的文化問題。</p>
<p>「文化進化論」，原著者在序言中說，這是在大學中「文化人類舉」的數大冊的講稿中提出的綱要，材料非常豐富。我們如對文化問題有了初步的研究，譬如我們已經讀過「文化的研究」一書，而想作更深一層的研究的話，那末就讀這一本書，是最適合不過的事情。</p>

<h3>集中收解之後　拆息平定劃頭小一角　—廣角回昂…銅元續短—</h3>
<p>近日銀洋市面因創辦匯劃集中、一般人心咸移其目標於錢業準備庫及票據交換所、致市塲中形勢日見呆滯、將來歸併辦妥、則各種行市勢必無形淘汰、於整理金融上固有莫大擘助也、昨拆息價依然保持原狀、早午同為一角八分、而劃頭加水因集中收解之影響、巳漸見退化、初開五角、繼改六角、均較前日跌落一角矣、拆票交易、早市轉賑一百五十餘萬、新交易二十餘萬、午市無交易、小總會中交易六十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖四十餘萬、新做二十餘萬、鈔票交易收回七十餘萬、發出流通券五十餘萬、暗記券三十餘萬、各路滙欵三十餘萬、客路來源二十萬、去胃三十餘萬、銀行收解消息、外商銀行收解票欵一百六十餘萬、各種貨墊雜欵收解二百三十餘萬、特種　欵四十餘萬、外匯　欵六十餘萬、　　　四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵一百六十餘萬、各種貨墊等雜欵收解二百七十餘萬、特種匯欵六十餘萬、外匯結欵八十餘萬、進倉二十萬、日商銀行收解票欵一百五十餘萬、各種貨墊等雜欵收解二百叫十餘萬、特種滙欵六十餘萬、外滙結欵五十餘萬、出倉六十萬、錢莊洋公單收解叫千二百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解四百二十餘萬、現欵收解合直</p>

<h3>證券　公債徘徊不定　前後趨勢漲跌不同</h3>
<p>連日公債市面完全因河北局勢弛緊、而起不定之波盪、昨市始以形勢再緊、跌風再度猝厲、繼以空頭抵補、復轉回漲、一日間起伏之混亂、人心之忐忑可知、綜觀日來市面過程、市價迭起迭仆、大跌小回、終則跌而過之、市面壓力可知、兼此次債券市價傾跌、跌落尙不為鉅、市上昔尙有看好論調者、今則轉為一致看小、並聞上月收戶之某金融方面、本月期竟全部吐出、故情市在茲籌碼充濫下、實難有所樂觀也、昨日經過、上午開盤除編遣漲起元許、市價拉提於平外、裁兵起即見不振、以斯市上賣氣冉盛、各帮出售極多、叫十八·三十二·亦有相當結出、鹽稅金短等劇落一元、入後稍轉和緩、次盤因三十五·二十一·五十四吸收、回上七八角許、午市改做一盤、裁兵一九關漲起一元、入後祇漲起數角、良以晚報消息未見良好、人心轉虛之故、總計全日市價、結果前後背道而馳、編遺此次漲元半不等、監稅後則跌落一元左右、成交總額共一千九百零三萬五千元、茲將其高低結果、列比較表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紐約股市帶堅</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（十三日）紐約股市、交易淸淡、價格參差帶堅、小麥之暴跌與立法之不定、原與市面有惡劣之影響、但此情形皆為源源不絕之投資需要所抵消、小交易所股票在特種股之領導下略升、債市參差帶軟、全日成交八十六萬股、茲將道瓊斯紐約指數列左、</p>
<h3>紗花　連日大跌後　紗市轉入安靜之境　看高看低中外紗商目光各異</h3>

<p>金鷄長豐盤盤拋賣　標紗前市解盤、各月市象平靜、不若上日之狂風、因華北消息緩和、書中新買者亦抱觀望態度、祗有零星散戶抵空各月比上日收盤價微漲一·二·三·角、午後開盤、一盤散戶心思極度看好、各月均漲一·二·三角、詎料外商又來拋賣、長豐盤盤賣出、為數約計二千包外、故拍至三收盤時、又現軟化之狀、客帮現紗交易沉悶、又有一說、本月份某廠仍有交貨五百包說、結果各月比上午盤價跌二·三·五·七·角、查賣出裕大六百包、重隆四百包、瑞大一千二百五十包、潤康九百包、長餘六百包、長豐二千二百五十包、買進大孚八百包、通記一千一百五十包、均昶一千四百五十包、信誠五百五十包、仁豐五百包、益昶三百五下包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>氣候亢旱　棉花跌風稍殺</h3>
<p>棉市跌後又傳穩靜、且有一部分播散空氣、對於七月期有收貨說、實則運日在落、或有反動可能、邇來氣候太早、新棉發育當受影響、市價固能平穩、不過美棉消息平常耳、</p>
<p>近期棉賣戶轉稀標花前市開盤、各月微見上漲、因市塲流言、謂某花號業已由空翻多在近月收貨、且在七月期預備收二萬擔、套出八十月、種種空氣頗濃、故賣戶較少、但美印棉市疲弱、結果各月比上日收盤價漲五分、午後開盤又現平澹無勁之勢、因上海現棉充足、不過天氣較早、新棉發育受其打擊、結果近月比上午收盤價跌五分、遠平、查賣出信誠一千擔、穗隆三千五百擔、源大二千一百擔、愼昌一千七百擔、愼記四千三百擔、潤康二千五百擔、長和一千八百擔、益康一千八百擔、瑞源一千一百擔、源興昌一千一百擔、買進潤康二千擔、通記一千二百擔、元一一千三百担、長豐一千五百擔、同和五千擔、益豐一千五百擔、益豐二千九百担、賡豐一千一三百担、均昶二千三百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>時異勢遷　東洋紗將重列標準　停止七年一朝恢復！</h3>
<p>本市華商紗布交易所原有日紗標準等級、自民國十七年濟南慘案發生後、祇拍華紗、茲據市塲（十二日）傳聞、將於二十五年一月起、日紗回復列入等級、以示親善、惟東洋紗在市塲上本甚活躍、而今可交割、其勢更張、此後紗市之波瀾、當非今日可比、而華紗經營又多艱難矣、</p>
<h3>美棉同業等候　華盛頓方面之發展</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况呆滯、價因利物浦消息不佳、穀類疲弱、紡織品需要惡劣、七月期多頭了結、及經紀商拋售、各月跌三至五磅音、旋以市價跌小、同業需要轉佳、又以鐵克塞斯大雨、有人購進、價乃回上、同業等候華盛頓方面之發展、投機買賣均减、收盤時略有補空、故市價堅穩、計現貨不動、期貨漲二至四磅音、英棉現貨跌五點、期貨跌七八點、印棉初因投機家及歐洲出口商賣出而疲、後因塲中同業在跌價時買進而回、計平果爾不動、奧姆辣跌半羅比、白羅溪不動、原電錄左、（十三日電）</p>

<p>又據孟買電、十四日四五月期白羅溪花之開盤預測、為二百十二羅比、較上日收盤跌半羅比粉漲五六分：麥跳一角半</p>
<h3>糧食　霉令無雨粉麥再漲</h3>
<p>粉昨日是初平繼則逐步猛漲之象、以洋跌報價、芝加哥繼跌五六角不等、坎拿大麥一二角零、當開價時、以洋麥連跌三日、業中人心、不免見軟、故近期開價曾跌一二分、但過此之後、即逐步高漲、因白銀問題之嚴重、廠家對於定貨、不免深具戒心、而本年入夏以來、已經久旱、目下已入霉令、又復赤日當空、這無雨意、因此人心皇皇、以為去年之大旱慘象、又難倖免、是以業內外買氣、步步俏利、殊為一般人所不能逆斜也、迨至下午開盤、人心尤復堅肖、開賈即又漲二三分、以後本月份已趨平定、遠期旋則由唐帮回出、天津帮徵進、惟內也客戶、及本街孚空、則仍暢進、故市氣依然異常佾利、觀此後如得甘霖大浦、方張之氣、當可抑平、否則人心終不能寬鬆也、結果本月份猛漲叫分七釐半、七月份漲叫分七釐半、八月份漲六分二釐半、九月份漲六分半、十月份漲五分半、十一月份漲五分二釐半云，</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面當開價後、以江南北各屬均感久旱、去平大旱之殷鑒不遠、業內外心思不免均起呈恐、是以七月份開價後、市氣即步步高昂、不過事實上之需要、因銀根奇緊、殊見平平、此項漲風、無異為人心之作用也、迨至下午開盤、市氣又見猛漲、交易亦大見旺暢、較上午又漲五六分、觀此神局面、完全為久旱所激成、如果甘霖即降、風潮或可即平也、結果七月份漲一角二分、八月份漲一角二分、九月份漲一角半之巨、十月份漲一角二分、現麥市面、以標準高漲、亦好二三分、因到貨日有近萬包、廠家安胃平常、故漲度無幾也、開滁州麥三元四角半、江新州麥三元叫角、鎭江麥三元三角七分、次三角、揚州浦鎮麥三元三角八分、南京太平麥三元三角六分、安亭麥三二元二角、太倉麥三元二角九分、次二角半、崑由麥三元三角半、次三角、巴城麥三元三角半、吳淞麥三元二角半、次二角、福新去三千三百包、信大去一千五百包、阜豐去三百包云、</p>
<p>海外市面、或將隨時發生反動、但大勢則依舊看小、廠市軟弱、加麥之剩餘約為二萬三千五百萬斛、田中作物之狀况極佳、</p>
<h3>水田苦旱　杜粳洋米暢銷價漲</h3>
<p>本米（滬南）昨客幫來源共到二十六號、（貨共五千餘石）、而其久疲市况、昨則以述日天無霉雨、有碍農產、人心都有向上之意、局勢頓有轉變、本街銷塲屢有舉辦、故市形帶緊、做開各厚粳如蘇同粳個竟驟升二三尺、而南港早稻亦好角半至二角許、僅各晚稻以躉胃停滯、祗好角許、陰變元亦帶起尺外、杜尖則仍平常（滬北）河下各路到船十三叫艘、市上各種去胃白粳早市依然平淡、午市稍轉活絡、個形緊起數分至一角、早薄稻零化高料尙可、中次交呆、市形高挺中次和平、白元及其他各色無榮辱、</p>
<p>洋米昨市况頗形活潑、因本街與滬寗路及長江各戶續辦不巳、而江浙內地又以天旱不雨、人心恐慌、蓋恐又遭去年之旱災、因此浙省內地各帮辦冒又貪、西貢米消化最旺、全市開出一號一萬五千包、三號一萬包、又一三號回籠貨亦有六百五十噸成交、小絞開七千包、暹暹安南高貢各米亦有二千包左右、總計有四萬包左右之鉅、交易既旺、人心亦為向上、雖在銀根緊迫與時局不靖中、而米價終被天埋所拉起、昨各米又漲一角及五六分不等、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市逐漸開展</h3>
<p>本埠沉寂之絲市、現已逐漸開展、紐約莊口亦久靜思動之勢、故邇來歐美二埠日有來帳、成交者亦不少、若滙價能更穩定、則絲業市氣、不難復趨繁榮云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新蘭花米口質乾凈</h3>
<p>蘭花米本屆新貨將於月杪登塲、查往年來貨因貨品不純、每為顧客非議、蓋此貨收採時以晒於砂地上、故成乾後輒有泥砂混雜、而實利者不予篩凈、反有另攙泥砂、致品質愈劣、且以泥砂之重量、多費水脚稅餉、故此間號方疊函勸告貨客、注意改良、昨據客函復訊、該處莊客共同公議之下、巳决定本屆新貨一律將砂篩凈、以期迎合銷路、故首批來貨品質旣佳、成本自必稍增矣、</p>
<h3>五金　大馬口鐵現貨奇缺</h3>
<p>二十四號至二十八號大馬口鐵近來現貨大缺、紗廠家及玩具廠等需辦甚殷、因此市貨不够分配、而到貨方面市面不佳、裝來不多、行情計二十四號每箱估六十五元、二十八號售五十二元、聞開出有三叫十箱、百老滙路一帶同業近來亦多購辦、故交易前途殊甚良好云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳蘊素）</p>
<p>一般在敎育圈裏跑得團團轉，溜得一溜烟的羣，看着圈外的一切，好像別有一洞天，恨不得立刻脫去這牢籠，來領略一回才好。可是捧在敎育圈外的羣，看見圈內的輝煌燦爛，光怪陸離，又覺得個中的風味，妙不可言。最好去混一下，總敎授們的法螺，吹得震天價響，好回到故鄉去，嚇一嚇盪三的同志。</p>
<p>在一個女子沒有對手方的時候，覺得戀人好像是生命的火，一日不可缺，恨不得早日擺脫着伊爸爸媽媽的監護，去和愛人過着卿卿我我的旖旎生活。誰知到了戀愛成熟，快要穿着嫁衣的時候，又覺得終年厮守慣的爸爸媽媽，一旦遠離了他倆去和愛人在一起，未免有點太自私了。然而不去的話，又覺得太那個，這眞兩難哩！</p>
<h3>初夏之夜</h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>雖然是初夏的季節，但是到了晚上却還帶着一些暮春時節的氣侯；穿了一件薄綢衣衫走到外面，也本使人們受不住的寒顫。</p>
<p>是一個星期六的晚上吧；蔚，豪，優，他們三個人到我這裏來約我到外灘公園去談心，並且還到就近廣東店裏去買來了一盒廣東點心，是預備到公園裏去吃的。</p>
<p>三條不整齊的影子，在幽黯的街燈下搖幌着，每一張蒼白而罩上一層生活的憂鬱的臉子上，已暫時顯露了一絲懽愉的色彩。</p>
<p>彷彿似幽靈般的，拖着了個沉重的肢體，沿着北蘇州河走去；但，週遭是那麼靜穆的，整個的煩囂像已跌進了死寂裏面。——我們也忘記了自家兒現在還置身在那繁榮的大都會裏，彼此都沒有一句話，讓那可憎的寂寞來統治了我們的空間——</p>
<p>在公園中，游人並不多，然而有幾處綠樹蔭裏，燈光暗處却有人在扮演着種種不堪入目的活劇。不過我們也不去留心這些，祗自顧在江畔的一排條椅上坐了下來。</p>
<p>一鈎上弦新月靜靜地躲在頭頂，它似乎在窺探我們每個人心底裏所蘊藏的秘密；無數星子，却圍着它在很俏皮的映眼。電炬在黑暗中迸着火花，霓虹在立體的建築物上劃着弧綫，黃浦江裏的小火輪，吼出那一聲聲尖銳的怪呌；它，使我的心兒震驚，使我的靈魂顫動……</p>
<p>江海關上的鐘聲、幽幽地送到我們的身邊，衝破我們無邊的沉悶。蔚開了盒子取出點心來，大家無拘束的嚼着，已把剎那的苦痛扔進了黃浦江裏，讓浪潮把它冲入大海洋裏去，永遠不要回來。自己覺得已像個孩子，回復了童年時代的天眞，彼此之間重又充滿了友情的歡愛！</p>
<p>—呵！這偉大的，至高無上的友情啊</p>
<p>我們在公園外面，提手分別之後，各自踏上了初夏之夜的街頭，走回了自家的寓所。</p>
<h3>兩副面孔</h3>
<p>— 南海沙鷗</p>
<p>阿Q的鄰人阿奴，責備他具着兩副面孔。（Double-faced　Diplomacy）原來阿Q流年不利，生了幾塲惡病，身體虛弱。家裏又是弄得東穿西洞，吃盡當光。只賸着祖上傳留下來的一隻紫銅舊香爐，院子裏栽着的一株虬龍羅漢松，還有近宅兩畝半嘸糧田，牢牢地守着不肯出賣。</p>
<p>阿奴家裏是個暴發戶，歷來放印子錢盤剝了別人不算，還要逼着阿Q事事都得聽從他的意思。他家的僕婢們又天天向着阿Q尋事。阿Q知道自己力道不够，過去吃了他的耳光，還要還還手，喊着旁人來說句公道話。後來着着失敗，便連正眼也不敢覷，哼都不哼一聲了。</p>
<p>『好漢不吃眼前虧。』這是阿Q明哲保身的定心丸。於是他見到了阿奴家裏的僕婢，甚至於一隻小黃狗，都得表示十分親善的態度，免得惹是招非。可是阿Q回過頭來，到底不能一無心事。走到門裏，和自家兒子們談談講講，便不免心頭火起。兒子們又不懂人事，對着惡鄰頂個白眼，噴噴唾沫，是不能免的。給阿奴家裏的人見到或聽到了，便又來一頓咆哮。</p>
<p>前不多天，阿Q家裏的羊子不知給誰打死在阿奴的田角上。這田角原來是覇佔阿Q的。阿奴便找到了一個大題目，說道：「你好！你老是對我面和心不和。我家順風順水，你來把羊打死在我田角上，給我個不吉利。此刻非得把你家的羅漢松斬倒，兩畝半嘸糧田賣給我，紫銅香爐獻過來，燒還我路頭不可！」</p>
<p>「原來阿奴有個得力的家僕，一個扮着紅面孔專門對着阿Q威嚇；一個扮着白面孔專門軟騙。軟硬兼施，剛柔相濟。這纔真是兩副面孔的外交手段，怎得不把阿Q弄得頭眩眼花，身不由主呢！」</p>
<h3>被壓廹的民族</h3>
<p>— 士英</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>它是沒有一些可以糟塌的，它的老根，梗子，和葉兒，全是中國藥料裏面很重要的東西；尤其是它的葉兒，初採下時，簡直比白紙還潔凈，人們往往用它來包紮熟食。再有它的花辦和比較嫩一些的根，—就是藕，更是夏天最淸雋的食品。」</p>
<p>干是伊就命令張德去吩咐那些種荷的人立卽拔出幾支鮮嫩的藕來，當塲洗凈了，切成一片一片的嚼吃；我們在御舟上的人，也都仗着伊老人家的福，得以嘗鼎一臠。大家都不覺竊然自喜；其實鮮藕的滋味雖好，却也不是什麼難得的東西，那個不會飽啖過，只是今天吃的藕，係出太后所賜，便似覺分外有味了。我們就是這樣一壁啖着鮮藕，一壁啖着那些穿藍色短褂的小太監們倐起倐落地在移植新荷，不覺把全湖繞遍了，其時太陽還不曾行到中天咧！</p>
<p>「現在，時候是差不多了」！太后敎李蓮英掏出時錶來看了一看時刻之後，便吩咐道：「我們不必再繞圈子了」，把船移向湖心去，穩穩地泊在那裏，待我們用過了午飯再作計較！</p>
<p>伊這麼一說，船就立刻撥轉了方向，慢慢地，穩穩地，搖向湖的中央去了。搖到差不多模樣，太后就發出了停船的命令；這御舟上一般也有兩支鐵鐄置備着，此刻就一起放下了水去，船便跟着停住了，但聽四周的湖水，輕輕地在船底上冲盪着，發出谷隆谷隆的聲響來，太后倒也並不引為可厭，但瞧這船停穩了便不再說什麼話。（三四〇）</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十四回　別有悟心西人談建設不無遺憾寒士種相思</p>
<p>到你這兒來讀書的學生，他會癩蝦蟆想吃天鵝肉，把他看中了。每天下午五六點鐘的時候，他就溜到後門外這小巷子裏，踱來踱去。志前道：他在那小巷子裏踱來踱去，也許有別的事吧？茶房笑道：這小巷子裏，就是住了幾戶窮鬼，那有什麼事？而且那朱家女孩子，也是偷偷縮縮的和他打無綫電。志前正色道，你不要再胡說了。這位姑娘，是個舊家庭的女子，為了吃飯的原因，不得不到小西天來賣臉子。實在的說，人家並不是下流人。茶房知道程老爺是喜歡朱家姑娘的，人家都有些生氣了，還說什麼，因之靜悄悄的，也就離開了志前的房間。志前心理暗想着，難道眞的，那女孩子，這樣的容易變換態度嗎？他暗忖着，自己也是在尾子裏來回的踱着步子。他點點頭之後，接着又搖搖頭，獨自鬧了一會子，已經到了五點鏽。向窗子外看看天色，情不自禁的踱着步子走出了房門，接着也就向淸小西天的後門口走了。這裏兩扇小小的白板門，芷也是虛掩着。志前手扶了門，緩緩的伸出頭去，向外看着，只見王北海將兩手揷在褲子口袋裏，低了頭，在小巷子一步一步的。由東到西的踱了過去。這樣悄悄的走，不見對門那胡嫂子院子裏有什麼動靜。（二四〇）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>原當貨</h3>
<p>— 枕綠</p>
<p>先人在鄉鎭上經營衣業有五十年。衣莊上的顧客，鄉人鄉婦佔大份，他們多數知曉衣莊裏的衣貨，有原當貨和做新貨的區分，喜歡指明要買原當貨的。</p>
<p>原來衣莊裏大批衣貨的來源，是典當裏過欺沒贖的東西，一年兩次給打成一個個比牛車盤還大的衣包，不論貨品的新舊好歹，必須一古腦兒買進，由衣莊裏買貨先生逐件過目標價，陳列到貨架上發賣：這些，就是所謂原當貨。</p>
<p>原當貨有逐件不同的質料和身裁，供給顧客的選擇，使他們得到相宜的貨品。身裁，即使有一二分的差異，在克實的鄉人們是不大苛求的；他們覺得唯一可取之點，還因原當貨有縝密縫紉的針綫和耐用的質料：這都已經該貨原主的道地經營，决沒有預防或將遭到質當的沒贖的惡運，肯存不妨稍為含糊一點的成見，可以斷言的。每件原當貨上有經過典當手續的記號存在隱角可辨，這是有經騐的衣莊顧客所能察騐面信任的。確然，大批的新衣貨是論件計工資，速成應市的，在裁料和縫工方面的不免比較的草率一點，自不能受經紀人的歡迎，雖然也有耐用的質料，和那式樣是時髦的。</p>
<p>不過，衣莊上做新貨的衣件給人買了去，很多半途進當，又輪轉到衣莊上來，便一律取得原當貨的資格—有典當裏做着的記號可作强有力的護符！反比未經服御和進當的新衣易於脫售了！也有一件原當貨，屢次從衣莊的櫃擡上賣出，典當的櫃檯上當進，輪轉着又登上衣莊的貨架；這樣，本是好端端的一件加工選料定製的，有的還未經一度穿着上身的新衣，經過了多番乎續的蹂躪，多年氣候的蝕化，弄得糟不經用，却還很給一班愛買原當貨的人們所信賴，肯化着比該件定製時略低的代價買去的。這裏，得到一個有趣的比喻：那做新貨轉胎的原當貨，好比一班善於投機的靑年們，那幾度重來的原當貨，芷像地方上一班屢仆屢起有似不倒翁式的老鄉紳！</p>
<p>原當貨有別種貨品所無的特殊趣味，就是在幾千百件那麼多的件數中，沒有一件完全同的，並且逐件都總有多少過去的成續遺留着。倘使衣業中有相當資格和興味的人，加以精密的考察和探討，定可得到那原當貨的幾個舊主人—或有多數的主人—的個性，習慣，當時的環境和行動，甚至推察到一個家庭，一時期的社會的狀况。</p>
<p>原當貨不是盡屬衣件，（固然，大部份的典當裏承當和滿沒的貨還是衣件，）也有飾物，銅錫器等，由承攬每一盤滿貨的衣莊附帶買進，挑選出那繁銷的成件，或個宜於當地的東西，便在衣莊的門市上發賣，把那不中留的東西總兌給銀飾店和銅錫店等，以免麻煩。熟悉這項情形的人們，會到衣莊上去問取那所需的東西，常有便宜貨買到的。現在，上海有開設在鬧市，裝璜富麗的售貨商店，他們發賣的金銀珠鑽什物和鐘表之類，有一部份也是出於典當的原當貨啦。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>剿滅臭虫運動</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>夏天一到，臭虫又要出來大活動了。</p>
<p>外國有沒有臭虫，不得而知。但從日本人呌臭虫為「南京虫」一點上看，臭虫像是中國獨有的。</p>
<p>夏天真是一個臭虫的世界。一到夜間，牠們就成羣結隊的在床鋪上逡巡起來。牠們不但擾撓得你不能安服，還要吮吸得你呌苦連天。然而人們雖厭惡牠們，因為除不勝除，也就無奈牠何了。</p>
<p>現在却有人發起一個剿除臭虫運動了。發起人是幾位公共衛生研究會會員。他們深知一般平民受臭虫之苦，而社會人士又對這問題不大重視，故今夏特發起這一個運動，以解除平民的痛苦。他們這個運動的第一步，是發起一個「臭虫生活研究」的徵文比賽，喚起全國研究生物者，對這問題加以注意。這種運動雖然很別緻，但却是很有意義的。</p>
<p>第一，他們發起這個運動的目的，是要解除平民睡眠的痛苦，這是非常可取的。</p>
<p>第二，他們能注意到社會人士所不重視的問題，這種精神，也是可嘉的。</p>
<p>第三，他們要驅除臭虫，不尚空談，而從研究臭虫的生活入手，方法亦是很切當的。</p>
<p>此外，他們這一次懲文研究的範圍很廣，舉凡臭虫的生理組織，生活狀態，生産情形，以及臭虫能傳染何種病菌，臭虫的死敵等，都包括在內。說不定將來各方研究的結果，不但可以發現絕滅臭虫的方法，還對對於生物學上有新的貢獻。若一般學生能因今番研究臭虫的機會，而引起研究其他事物的興趣，這是再好沒有的。</p>
<h3>鯉魚門</h3>
<p>— 樺枷</p>
<p>船一走出香港口的吸水門，有一些胆子小的女客們便心裏恐慌起來，口裏不住地嚷着——</p>
<p>『鯉魚門要來了，過了鯉魚門便望不見天邊了，這一次風浪可大咧。阿彌陀佛，菩薩保佑：風平浪靜。』</p>
<p>她們在呌着，還在相互地警報着，有些還預備定了一些梳打餅干在準備着真的風浪大了時，吞不下飯而用餅干來　肚子，還有一些身體較弱一點的更了不得，把一些臉盆之類放在床前，在準備着嘔吐時的便利。於是女客們都零亂起來了。</p>
<p>裏驚醒起來，看見她們這樣忙亂的情形，心裏也不禁有點好笑，不過，一刻見自己仔細地回想一下，那才糟糕咧：出大海洋，這還是第一次，而且又是一個人兒浮浪，說不定遭遇着了暴風雨時，巨浪撞弄了的船隻，說不定自己這不健康的身體也有點忍不得而至嘔吐咧。</p>
<p>『一個人孤獨地走上旅途，確是可怕的啊。』</p>
<p>依稀地我還記起朋友在送船時由衷地說了這句話。在感情澎湃着了我的心胸時，我是感不到這一句話的可寶貴的，直至到了這『呌天不應，呌地不靈』的當兒，心裏才不免地承認這話的真實了。不過</p>
<p>『不過這又有什麽方法。一個人為了生活，實在是再沒有辦法不過的了。當你一定要孤獨地跨上了旅程而去找尋你的生活的時候，你是無論如何也不可以避免的。為了生活啊，你的一切……』</p>
<p>都得犧牲掉，還有什麽可惜。我如這樣地安慰着朋友，安慰着自己。我象一個從容就義的死刑，我沒有一點受別離而苦惱的顔色顯露着。</p>
<p>「鯉魚們，過鯉魚門啊！」</p>
<p>跟着船身的不自然的波動，我便聽到了這很大而帶有象哀鳴一樣的聲音。</p>
<p>我想站起來，穿上鞋子到甲板上去看看鯉魚門空間是一個什麽樣兒。可是為了船身的過於波動，我才站起來，便又給跌番下來。到底這是第一次經風浪，所以實在有點不大慣。船是忽上忽下地移動着，很急速而且又象很鹵莽的樣子！它的不規則的舉動，象一頭餓得兇了的獅子的怒吼一樣地不甯靜。</p>
<p>因此我只能貼伏地躺下了。躺下時，眼睛看着在窗眼上的海浪的忽上忽下，頭也有點昏了，腦子抽搐得痛得要命。孤獨而又可怕的旅程啊，讓你毀滅了吧！在無可奈何時，我只能咀咒了。</p>
<p>「嘔，嘔，格格！吐！」</p>
<p>婦人們開始嘔吐了。怪難聽的嘔吐聲音和一些臭味我開始可怕地感覺到了，用眼睛去巡搜着，婦人們是　白的唇兒鑲在可怕的蒼灰色臉孔中。</p>
<p>呻吟而又軟弱的聲音也鑽進耳朶來了。</p>
<p>可是，船兒還是拼着性命地向前衝，它是那樣崛強的地。</p>
<h3>飛蛾的讚禮</h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>一個暮春的夜晚，吃過了飯，回到填墓一樣的鴿子籠那麽窄狹的屋子裏，人像摘去了心似的無着無靠，什麽都懶得動，好像有滿肚子的懊惱和煩悶，但又想不透是打那兒來的。若是優柔地說，也許便是謂懨人的春愁所纏着吧。正在一腔無名挹鬱沒地方發洩的時節，忽然一隻小動物撲嗤地從窗口飛了進來，那輕悠的翅的振響的聲音引起我睜開閉着的眼睛。不想倒是隻蛾蟲土灰色的粉翼之，怪美麗的。它一逕不停地飛到燈前盡旋圈子，離開去，終又回來到燈前迴轉着！我視綫跟着它彷彿十分辛苦地翱翔了一頓，以為它原是自窗外飛來。過一會子總會仍舊飛了出動的，但久久却不見它飛去，彷彿再也不願飛到黑暗的外邊似的。想着自己反正沒玩兒解解悶兒，於是站起來，隨手抓了一把扇子，趕上去用力揮動着，起始是想驅它去了完事。因為它那一上一下的飛來飛去的一點小小的聲音，雖然是很微細，但如果繼續鬧下去，我的極需要幽靜的而不容易幽靜的思緒將給它擁得</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>加繚亂了。然而任是怎樣的趕，怎樣的追，它怎是不走，好幾次它的翅膀觸着了扇子，或竟是被打着跌落來了，可是掙扎了半嚮，又飛着。而自己經弄得有點發熱，瞧它那樣子，眞是可憐又可惡的，明明有一個自由的遼闊的天地伸展在眼前，讓它任意的遨遊，它徧是不欲那自由的天地，而且從那自由的天地飛進來這不自由的小屋子飽受無端的襲撞的痛苦，飛起來老是跟着牆壁天花杯的各種阻物碰了下來，這眞是何苦來。原來飛蛾是向着光明而又永遠追縱光明的，它一瞧有燈的光明的所在，卽馬上跟了去，如同得到了依靠似的，一輩子也不捨開，不幸那光明的燈往往就是燒身的葬地，好在現在這燈是有玻璃泡罩着，若是一支洋燭，一盞火油燈，它早便沒了小生命了。但作算是一支洋燭，一盞火油燈吧，它也會一樣猛烈地勇敢地投撲上去，絲毒不有畏怯。就着在鄉間的夜裏，燈是用火燃着的，態態的火舌昇往上，有蛾蟲進來了，全不必自己的動手，只儘瞧着，不一下它就逃不掉該紅焰焰的火花炙個焦灰，翅子一片汽散下來，躺在燈盤上死了，如今的燈是罩着玻璃泡，白磁的笠做頂，它儘是在笠項的週遭飄，那殺身的危險是减少到幾乎沒有了的。我却給攪得漸漸胃火了，燈不焚了它自己索性代着劊子手吧，於是趁着它貼在牆上休息的時候，輕悄悄地把扇子壓住了，另後用兩支針子釘牢它兩邊的翅子，看它動彈不得，却還是擺着腦袋在頻頻攢動，針子果然被掙股了，已沒了氣，跌在牆根邊，翻了翻，緩緩地爬着，不幾久又飛上來了，依舊飛向燈邊去。對這無知的小蟲熱烈的求尋光明的不怕難的磨折，不禁戚到一種憫憐的同情，這同情，這憫憐其實却是為着自己有時甚至連飛蛾那樣向着光明的勇烈都不如。在這無可如何的春夜裏，却沒想小小的蛾蟲竟使我得到了一種可貴的啟示！心要的煩惱亦像卸了好多。</p>
<h3>康乃馨</h3>
<p>— 代尼</p>
<p>在疏朗的樹蔭下走過一條舖若媒屑的小路，黃昏的太陽，從樹隙間橫射過來，兩條修長的影子就像兩條懶蛇似的在煤屑浮面蜿蜓。他們各自低着頭，踏着細小的有節奏底步伐，彷彿不願意打擾那時的寗謐的空氣。走過一列矮小的冬靑樹旁時，她伸過尖尖的手指，把一叢新放靑的嫩葉摘了過來，又隨手扭了個粉碎，同時自語似地低語着：</p>
<p>「我真想做一點事情呢」！突然她仰首向天空瞥了一眼，但是從遠處飛來，有一只小鳥—或許耳邊的鬢髮掩遮了她視的緣故，那些被蹂躪了的嫩葉一屑屑地從她手指掛下來。</p>
<p>「我曾這樣想過。曼」，她一點沒有興奮的樣子，「但是做一位闊太太不够舒服嗎」？</p>
<p>「哼！我眞不知道人類為什麼這樣地殘酷！對於一個無所適從的弱女子竟這樣，沒有同情心？」她忽然快走了幾步，彷彿想把心底的憂鬱和她同伴一樣地遠離她。</p>
<p>這里已是媒屑路的終點了，可以望見遠處被落日的餘暉煊染着的教堂的尖頂，憂怨的鐘聲正在這時候響了起來，那樣地悠長，槌着她的心房似的她驚醒過來。</p>
<p>「我要回去了」！旋轉身　對她同伴說。</p>
<p>同伴却早已站在她的背後。「曼，請你原諒我，我實在沒有帮助你的力量；自家的生活不是朝不保夕嗎？」</p>
<p>鐘聲繼續着，歸巢的鳥雀都在樹校上驚撲不安，是歸宿的時候了啊！</p>
<p>「得了！你不是說過我變了嗎？哼！變的人正多着哩」！她望着敎堂尖頂上的十字架發若星星的閃光。</p>
<p>她的同伴更走迂了一步，幾乎逼近她的鬢髪「現在不是鬥氣的時候。曼　不要太興奮！我說你變了，—是你的生活變了，這是環境遜迫你的！如果你想决心做一點事的話，先要改善你的生活，那就是先要打破…」他看到對方毫無動情地呆着！就轉了說話的方向：「我們眞可以走了，或許你的丈夫輕聲地打開櫥門來想找尋你的影子呢。」</p>
<p>她嘴角邊浮起了笑意，用手掌輕輕地擊着他肩頭「管我什麼事？瞧着吧，我要變得更使你驚異呢」</p>
<p>他們恢復了常態，並肩從側里出了園門，慢慢地向電車站走去。</p>
<p>在一家花店前她立停了，先對着玻璃窗整理蓬亂了的鬢髪，然後推進門去，買了一束她所不歡喜的加乃馨。</p>
<p>「你承認你變了嗎？」他笑着說：「為什麼買那樣素色的花呢？」</p>
<p>對方聽着，笑得灣起腰來：「這是我丈夫喜歡的啊，你知道嗎！」她故意對那將要憔悴了的花朶吻着。</p>
<p>「那末，不是個賢德的妻子嗎！」</p>
<p>那個像刺痛了她的心，嘴角灣了下來，甲自己的牙齒咬着自己的嘴唇，鳴咽地說：「敏，你希望我做一個賢德的妻子嗎？」</p>
<p>她的同伴不預料一句嬉語激發了她的眞情，不安地囁嚅着：「曼，原諒我一罷，我們是應該合作的，你不信這是句玩笑嗎？</p>
<p>「是的。你是瞭解我的，不過我太塲心了，想起了我的丈夫。」一輛黃包車過來兜生意，她就跳了上去，「好罷，我們再見」把手中的康乃馨授給了她的同伴。</p>
<p>「你不是也歡喜素色的花嗎？」</p>
<p>搖着手，黃包車撤腿跑了。他半響望着這束將要憔悴了的康乃馨。</p>

<h3>「父母子女」情報</h3>
<p>文化影業公司處女任務全部有聲對白巨片「父母子女」，自開攝以來，全體演職員工任務異常緊張，每夜自黃昏開始工作，直至次晨紅日高昇始止，故現已撮製過半，據聞成績優美。</p>
<p>「父母子婦女」片中之「出征歌」前夜收音時，敦請國立音專男女局學多位參加合唱，並由百樂門音樂隊伴奏，歌聲悲壯熱烈，聞者無不為之熱血沸騰。「出征歌」由名音樂劉雲局氏作曲，本片導演胡心靈作詞。雄壯動聽，他日家曉戶諭，乃意中事耳。</p>

<p>「父母子女」中之歌舞塲面，空前偉麗，所耗不下數千金，確開國產片之新紀元，不僅塲面偉大，佈景華麗，服裝鮮艷，舞藝高超，同時，意識亦甚正確，按該歌舞劇：「黃金萬兩」，係象徵女性解放，新時代之降臨，故不可與目下一般所謂歌舞表演同日而語，並由歌舞界翹楚龔秋霞小姐主演之，尤覺錦上添花。</p>
<h3>「敎王弄政」公映</h3>
<p>喬治亞立斯自攝「大富之家」之後，影迷們旦夕渴望其作品，聯美公司遂編譯十七世紀法國大主敎列區紐公爵，生之豐功偉績，聘喬治亞立斯氏主演，因該劇主角個性極難於表演，非亞氏莫屬也。配演演員如愛德華亞諾爾，（曾飾埃第康泰之「羅宮綺夢」中羅馬大帝者）擔任法王路易十三世，「泰山情侶」女主角瑪琳歐莎麗文化等均係傑出人才，所以珠聯璧合，相得益彰。「敎王弄政」一片不僅富有歷史值價，且集第八藝術之大成，為年來歷史宗敎宮闈片之最偉大奇麗者，是聯美無上權威作品。同時加映米老鼠第一部彩色短片「音樂會」，與美藝彩色音樂畫片「點金」，都是値得注意的作品。下為該片一幕。</p>
<p>代柬：凌鶴先生，有信存在電影消息編輯部，請於今日五時後來館。</p>

<h3>Understanding Reached by Both Sides; Qin Dechun and Matsui Conduct Negotiations; Japanese Side Believes the Situation Will Not Escalate</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Following the Zhangbei Incident, Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, came to Beiping and met with Qin Dechun once. Last night, Matsui went to Tianjin to meet with Umetsu, the commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in Tianjin, and Doihara, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shenyang, to report on everything. It is said that this matter will be resolved based on the results of local negotiations. Both sides have reached an understanding and a resolution is expected soon. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun previously came to Beiping on the orders of Song Zheyuan to report to He Yingqin on the recent military and political situation in Chahar Province. Yesterday, Matsui, the military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, visited to discuss the matter of the large-scale Gui travel group. As Matsui is now going to Tianjin to report to Doihara, Qin Dechun will also go to Tianjin this afternoon to visit various parties. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qin Dechun, the Director of Civil Affairs of Chahar Province, came to Tianjin early on the 14th by train due to a matter, to meet with a certain important person and conduct negotiations. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Zhangbei incident in eastern Chahar has been resolved through negotiation. Matsui, the Japanese military liaison officer stationed in Zhangjiakou, came to Beiping on the 13th to visit Takahashi, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy. That evening, he went to Tianjin to meet with Umetsu, the commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in Tianjin. He will come to Beiping and return to Zhangjiakou the day after tomorrow.

<p>(Tianjin) Lieutenant Colonel Matsui arrived in Tianjin from Zhangjiakou at 12:00 AM on the 13th. On the morning of the 14th, he met with Doihara, Sakai, and others to report on the Chahar Province incident and to discuss response strategies. (14th Japanese United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news from Tianjin, Major General Doihara, the head of the Kwantung Army's Special Service Agency in Shenyang, originally planned to go to Beiping this morning, but changed his plan. At 10:00 AM this morning, he held a meeting at the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese concession in Tianjin with Lieutenant Colonel Matsui, the head of the Special Service Agency in Zhangjiakou, and Major General Sakai, the chief of staff of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin, to discuss countermeasures for the Zhangbei incident. During the meeting, Matsui reported on the incident. The three men reached a consensus and gained insight into future developments, and agreed on countermeasures. Doihara also reported to the Kwantung Army in Changchun for instructions based on Lieutenant Colonel Matsui's report and the results of today's meeting. Therefore, his departure to Beiping is undecided. It is also expected that North China will gradually return to peace. (14th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A dispatch from Tianjin stated that Lieutenant Colonel Matsui, the head of the Kwantung Army's Special Service Agency in Zhangjiakou, told a group of Japanese reporters after today's meeting that, regarding the trend of the Chahar incident, he originally intended to negotiate with He Yingqin, the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, but depending on Song Zheyuan's attitude, the matter might be resolved through direct negotiations. (14th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Arrive in Beiping One After Another</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The second batch of Japanese troops, 1,400 men, arrived at Qinhuangdao on the Minghai Maru on the 13th. They landed early on the 14th and were inspected by Commander Umetsu. At 9:00 AM, they boarded the Beining Railway train under the supervision of Captain Adachi, the transportation commander, and headed to Aoxian, Tangshan, Yuguan, and Tanggu. A portion remained stationed in Qinhuangdao. Another unit of more than 500 infantrymen and more than 100 artillerymen boarded a train and passed through Tianjin after 6:00 PM on the 14th. After a brief stop, they departed to be stationed in Beiping. The Tianjin Japanese National Defense Women's Association expanded its organization and elected Colonel Kayashima, the commander of the infantry regiment of the garrison army, as its branch president. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Umetsu, the commander of the Japanese Army in Tianjin, finished inspecting the newly arrived Japanese troops at Qin Island and returned to Tianjin at 3:35 PM. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops stationed in North China scheduled for replacement in Beiping were originally 600 men, but were reduced to 350 men due to unforeseen circumstances. They will arrive in Beiping from Tianjin tonight. The Japanese troops are led by three officers, and three freight cars are attached to the rear of the troop train, all loaded with military equipment and supplies. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) 1,700 Japanese troops for reinforcement in North China arrived here today, adding to the 700 who arrived earlier, for a total of 2,400. Foreign sources confirm that 12 Japanese troop trains and one armored train carrying a mixed brigade of the Kwantung Army, including an artillery unit, have been passing through Shanhaiguan since the first day of this week. These Japanese troops had advanced as far as Luanzhou, but later retreated and are now stationed several miles inside Shanhaiguan. It is estimated that the brigade has a strength of about 4,000 to 5,000 men. There are currently eight empty trains at Shanhaiguan, ready to load troops to Luanzhou. At around 10:00 AM this morning, a plane flew over Beiping. This was probably the first plane to come to Beiping. The plane was a monoplane and flew very high, so its markings could not be identified. The plane circled the city once and then flew east. Japanese authorities say that the date of arrival of the air squadron has not been determined yet. Japanese military attaché Takahashi visited Bao Wen-yue last night. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There appears to be no new development in the situation in North China this morning. The second batch of Japanese troops arrived at Qinhuangdao last night. Its main force set off for Beiping today, while a small detachment set off for Shanhaiguan. The Japanese garrison troops stationed in Tianjin, whose term has expired, are scheduled to withdraw next Tuesday. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A detachment of 300 Japanese soldiers arrived in Beiping from Tianjin at 9:30 PM tonight to replace the Japanese soldiers who will depart from Beiping in a few days. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Heavy Japanese Troop Transport in the Area of Yuguan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the continuous arrival of new Japanese troops dispatched to China for replacement, the Japanese troops in the Yuguan area have been extremely busy with transport in recent days. A large number of replacement troops have arrived in the Suizhong area. The troops heading to Beiping and Tianjin arrived at Tanggu from Qin Island this morning, and those coming to Beiping can arrive by special train tonight. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Foreign sources here confirm that a portion of the Kwantung Army has indeed arrived at Shanhaiguan and is now stationed near the area, without necessarily advancing south of the Great Wall. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>A Portion of the Japanese Army Stationed in Rehe Has Been Transferred to Gubeikou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military officials in Tianjin stated that a meeting was held to discuss all follow-up matters concerning the Hebei issue. The headquarters of the Japanese mixed brigade stationed in Rehe has temporarily moved to Gubeikou, and the brigade commander Kawagishi has also arrived in Gubeikou. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Japanese military attaché Takahashi spoke with a Reuters reporter today, he acknowledged that Japanese troops have arrived at Gubeikou, and have probably advanced to Miyun, but he has not received official news about this matter. As for the claim that Japanese troops passed through Shanhaiguan, he claimed that he had not heard of it. Takahashi also stated that some of the Japanese side's demands regarding North China have been implemented, and others are currently being implemented. The Chahar Province incident has not yet been resolved, but the Japanese side has not yet made any demands, but this matter will have to be dealt with soon. He has met with Bao Wen-yue, and Bao said that he is willing to resolve all matters in accordance with He Yingqin's policy. He greatly appreciated this attitude. Wan Fulin's troops can remain stationed in Liaoning Province. Japanese planes will definitely fly over Beiping, but he could not predict when they would come and how many there would be. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Along the Beiping-Hankou Railway Line</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese planes No. 126 and No. 128, which were parked at the Tianjin Dongjuzi Airfield on the 14th, flew south along the Beiping-Hankou Railway Line at 7:00 AM, reconnoitered near Changxindian for a long time, and returned to Tianjin to land. At 11:00 AM, No. 128 carried a Japanese military officer from Tianjin and flew to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Line for low-altitude reconnaissance, returning after about 1:00 PM. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 9:30 AM today, a Japanese military plane flew to the western suburbs, circled for a long time, reconnoitered, and then flew northwest. The sound of the plane could only be faintly heard in Beiping, and the plane could not be seen. The so-called sightseeing air squadron of 30 planes that was supposed to come to Beiping has not yet arrived. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Beiping, Yu Xuezhong's troops and the Central Army are currently withdrawing from Hebei Province one after another. The advance team of Yu's army has already passed Baoding. A reconnaissance plane of the Kwantung Army flew over Beiping at 9:40 AM this morning and advanced towards Changxindian and Baoding to inspect the withdrawal of troops. Judging from the situation, the withdrawal of Yu's army and the Central Army can be completed around the 26th of this month. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The 32nd Army is Transferred to Qinghe; Departure Completed in Recent Days</h3>

(14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin is peaceful. It is generally believed that the Hebei issue is only a matter of minor details and that there will be no major developments. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin's various organizations held a banquet at the West Lake Hotel at 7:00 PM on the 14th to celebrate with Acting Mayor Shang Zhen and Liu Yushu, the Director of the Public Security Bureau. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Police Department Renamed Tianjin-Tanggu Security Department</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In order to facilitate the command of the security forces and maintain the security of Tianjin and Tanggu, the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters has decided to rename itself the Tianjin-Tanggu Security Headquarters. The water and land police and security forces in the Tianjin-Tanggu area will all be under the control of the Security Headquarters. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yuan Liang Talks; Peace in Beiping is Not in Danger</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yuan Liang said that regarding the Hebei diplomatic issue, the authorities have voluntarily implemented what the Japanese side hoped for, and there should be no further problems. He Yingqin went to Nanjing yesterday morning to report the progress to the Central Government. Bao Wen-yue is acting on his behalf in matters of the Military Affairs Commission. The peace in Beiping is originally my responsibility, and I will be responsible for maintaining it, and there will be absolutely no problems. However, recently, I have often heard various rumors inciting the public, which are often unrealistic and full of fantasies. Citizens are unaware and are mostly swayed by them, which is causing unnecessary anxiety. I hope that the press will provide timely explanations and apply rational judgment so that citizens will not be taken advantage of by rumors and cause themselves trouble. Moreover, the security of the city is jointly maintained by the military, police, and constabulary, and the precautions taken on weekdays are extremely thorough. Even though He Yingqin has left Beiping, it will not have any impact on the security of the city. In the future, any acts that endanger public peace and order will be strictly punished. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The members of the Military Affairs Commission were convened by Bao Wen-yue last night to hold a meeting at the Juren Hall, and Yuan Liang was also invited to participate. During the meeting, the methods for maintaining the security of Beiping were discussed in detail. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The security and order of Beiping are currently being maintained well under the command of Mayor Yuan Liang. Japanese military attaché Takahashi acknowledged tonight that Japanese planes will fly in formation over Beiping's sky. However, Takahashi claimed that this was for demonstration purposes, but it was purely a reconnaissance operation. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Kita Travels South for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Colonel Kita took the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Jinan at 10:20 PM on the 13th. After inspecting the situation, he will travel to Nanjing and Shanghai. (14th Japanese United News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Colonel Kita, the chief of the China Section of the Army General Staff Headquarters, took the Tianjin-Pukou Railway south last night at 10:00 PM. He told reporters at the station that the dark clouds over North China had cleared and entered an era of clarity, which is a great joy for East Asia. He planned to go to Jinan to meet with Wang Jingwei and other important officials of the National Government in Nanjing to exchange views frankly, and then travel from Shanghai to inspect Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian, before returning to Tokyo via Taiwan on July 8. (14th Electric Communications Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Visits Doihara</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, took the Beiping-Shanghai train back to Tianjin at 6:40 AM on the 14th. He immediately summoned senior officials of the bureau to his residence in the Ningyuan to listen to reports. Yin Tong said that this trip to the east lasted almost a month, and there are railway affairs to be dealt with, so he returned to Tianjin. Chairman Huang and Mayor Wang had no definite news of coming north before he left Nanjing. Regarding the current situation, because his luggage had just been unloaded, he did not understand the situation in various places, so he could not report. In short, it is misleading to be overly optimistic about the current situation, and it is also confusing to be overly pessimistic. This is something to pay attention to. At noon on the 14th, Yin Tong visited Doihara at the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese concession and spoke for a long time before leaving. Doihara originally planned to go to Beiping on the 14th, but the trip was canceled due to He Yingqin's southward departure. He plans to wait in Tianjin and meet him when He Yingqin returns. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tao Shangming came to Tianjin from Tanggu on the 14th to meet with Yin Tong. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Have No Intention of Withdrawing Troops Stationed in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(London) The British government currently has no intention of withdrawing its troops stationed in Tianjin. The authorities issued a statement on the morning of the 13th, stating that the British troops are stationed in Tianjin based on the Boxer Protocol, and that even though Japanese influence has expanded, the British troops have no intention of moving. The ambassador is about to move south, but this is for diplomatic convenience and has nothing to do with the current North China issue. (13th Japanese United News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) News from Washington states that the American infantry regiment stationed in Tianjin may move itself outside the "new Japanese area" to avoid being asked by Japan to withdraw. However, Britain has no intention of transferring the troops stationed in Beiping and Tianjin under the Boxer Protocol. The authorities also denied the rumor that the British Embassy in Beiping would move to Nanjing due to the actions of the Japanese in North China. Reuters has learned that the matter of moving the British Embassy to Nanjing has been under discussion for a long time, and this is entirely for diplomatic convenience and has nothing to do with the current situation in North China.

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Urges the People to Cooperate in Suppressing Bandits; Issues Six Measures to Encourage Prompt Cooperation</h3>
<p>(Chengdu) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently issued a message to the people of Sichuan, Kangding, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, urging them to cooperate in suppressing the Red bandits. The message stated that the remnants of Zhu De and Mao Zedong are plotting to join forces with Xu Xiangqian's bandits in western Sichuan, hoping to make a last-ditch effort. Observing the final collapse of their last resort, they will inevitably cross Kangding and Qinghai and head north to Gansu and Shaanxi. Chiang Kai-shek is personally supervising the armies and intensifying the encirclement and suppression, aiming to completely eliminate them within a short period of time. He hopes that the people of all provinces will promptly cooperate and work together. The measures that should be taken include: 1. Organize the baojia system, conduct household registration, and implement joint guarantee agreements to eliminate hidden bandits. 2. Reorganize local defense teams, organize militia squads, or volunteer teams to suppress bandits, and strengthen self-defense capabilities. 3. Organize detective networks, inspection posts, and sentry teams, and take on communication and liaison tasks to increase the strength of prevention and suppression. 4. Build blockhouses, build roads, strictly implement blockades, and concentrate food when necessary to fortify walls and clear fields. 5. Integrate with the officers and soldiers suppressing the bandits, promote mutual publicity among the people. 6. Implement the New Life Movement. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry to Rescue Cotton Mills; General Outline Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry invited the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Council to discuss the meeting to rescue cotton mills, which was held on the morning of the 14th. According to Liu Yin-fu, the entire rescue outline has been discussed in half a day, and the responsible executive agencies have been re-designated. Administration belongs to the Ministry of Industry, taxation belongs to the Ministry of Finance, and technology is the responsibility of the Economic Council, which is roughly the same as before. It has been discussed and decided that the rescue standards will be divided into three key points: management, technology, and taxation. For example, unified management to improve efficiency, improved technology to improve quality, strict pricing to stabilize the market, production and sales cooperation to facilitate the flow of goods, and improved taxation to balance costs. All of the above points will be strictly regulated, and the relevant authorities will supervise and implement them. The meeting was originally scheduled to last for three days, but because the general outline has been determined and the detailed methods have their own expertise, the meeting was temporarily changed to allow the relevant parties to study them separately, so that each can do their best and each can do what they can, and the methods can be determined in detail with reference to the situation. The three parties will exchange opinions in writing at any time, and as soon as they are determined, they will be submitted to the competent authorities and higher-level agencies for approval and implementation. As for improving the tax system, the Ministry of Finance has been working hard to find ways and has gradually made some progress. The Ministry of Finance has ordered Yang Guang-sheng to be a special secretary and Hou Zhi-yao to be a member of the Customs Research Association. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Opening of the Health Campaign Conference</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The 14th Municipal Health Campaign Conference has been decided to be held today. By shouting out loud, we can give citizens the opportunity to awaken and reflect. Its benefits to the people are of a deeper and more meaningful significance than general sports. As we are now in the summer season, when diseases are rampant, if we do not prevent and control them in time, they will spread and be difficult to manage. Shanghai is a bustling city where people from all directions gather, so it is even more important to have a comprehensive plan to ensure the health of society. This is something that everyone should sympathize with and absolutely not ignore in the health campaign.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the bankruptcy of the countryside, people's lives have been miserable and have reached the extreme. The rampant bandits and the disasters of floods and droughts have made the people feel that there is no way to turn around. Shanghai, on the other hand, is relatively well-off and has been spared some of the pain. However, the spread of epidemics often causes coffins to be seen on the road. In fact, although the epidemics that are prevalent in the autumn season seem to be dangerous, prevention and control are not very difficult. For example, the only medium of transmission for diseases such as cholera and dysentery is flies. If we can strictly maintain the cleanliness of food and eliminate the exposure of filth, and at the same time carry out preventive vaccinations to enhance the body's natural resistance, we can eliminate the potential breeding of pathogens and seek fundamental purification. This is not like scarlet fever or meningitis, which are transmitted through the air and are not easy to prevent. In this situation where human efforts can be turned around, and yet we still allow it to invade and spread, is this not a great regret in the world? The creeds issued by this Health Campaign Conference are: (1) Accept preventive vaccinations. (2) Drink boiled water. (3) Do not eat unclean food. (4) Do not spit anywhere. (5) Exterminate flies. They are all simple and concise, and hit the nail on the head. If everyone can deeply understand and practice them, the elimination of epidemics can be expected.</p>
<p>This year's health campaign has some improvements over previous years. One is to hold a kitchen competition, and the other is to set up health counselors. We already know that avoiding epidemics starts with keeping food clean, so the responsibility of the kitchen is nothing less than the control of our right to life. The meaning of holding a kitchen competition is to awaken the cook's attention to cleanliness and to encourage their efforts to improve. As for the lack of understanding of hygiene concepts among the general public, it is an undeniable fact. Now, middle and elementary school students are used as health counselors, so that each can do their best and fulfill their responsibility of enlightenment. There should be considerable results. Moreover, we have further improvements to make. Since the health campaign concerns the entire city, we should strive for universal effectiveness. Households above the middle class already have a more enlightened knowledge and are easily amenable to reform. As for the general slums, they do not have enough food and clothing, let alone hygiene. However, the spread of pathogens often originates from these slums. How to provide them with appropriate assistance and seek practical improvements depends on the overall management of the municipal authorities.</p>
<h3>The United States Is Paying Attention to China's Financial Situation; Whether to Send Personnel to China Is Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, Secretary of State Hull was asked whether the United States would follow in the footsteps of Britain and France and send an economic observer to China.

<p>(Washington) Reporters asked Secretary of State Hull that Britain has sent financial advisor Sir Frederick Leith-Ross to China to investigate monetary issues, and France has also decided to appoint a representative to go to China at the same time. Will the United States do the same? Hull replied, "Although the United States has not yet taken any decision on this matter, there is a possibility of cooperating with other countries to study the financial and economic situation of China, and the silver issue will also be included in the study."

<p>There are rumors that five countries with economic ties to China, including Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan, have decided to convene an International Economic Conference to reorganize China's finances, and that Japan has been notified. However, Japan has not accepted any proposals from any party, and the British side said that the claim that Japan refused to participate is groundless. It is an electrical transmission. Furthermore, there was no proposal for joint dispatch of economic experts, only a notification from Britain that it had decided to dispatch Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.

<h3>German Envoy Arrives in London; Naval Negotiations Reopen; Detailed Analysis of Tonnage and Gun Positions; Japan Does Not Abandon Demand for Naval Equality and Opposes Expanding Scope of Future Conference</h3>
<p>(London) British-German naval talks reopened at the Foreign Office at 11:00 this morning. After German envoy Ribbentrop met with British Foreign Secretary Hoare, he also met with German representative Kidland and British Foreign Office Undersecretary Cranky until 1:20 PM. Formal talks will begin at 5:00 PM today, at which time the representatives will thoroughly analyze the figures for various warship tonnages and gun positions. The atmosphere surrounding the signatory countries of the Washington Naval Treaty and the participation of Germany and Russia in the naval conference this autumn is now considered better than before.

<p>(London) British-German naval talks, which had been suspended for several days, are scheduled to resume tomorrow morning. German chief representative Ribbentrop arrived here by plane from Germany at 7:00 PM this evening.

<p>(Nanjing) Naval Minister Osumi today published an article in the Kokumin Shimbun, stating that Japan will strongly oppose Germany and Russia participating in future naval conferences. The Naval Minister took this attitude partly because he feared that the seven-nation conference would become increasingly complicated, and partly because the public has so far believed that the conference would first discuss Japan's demand for naval equality, in other words, Japan's naval position in the Pacific. Allowing Russia and Germany to participate in the conference is intended to limit European tonnage, but Japan is taking this opportunity to reiterate its desire not to participate in European affairs, not only because Japan has nothing to gain by allowing Russia to participate.

<h3>France Considers Response to Britain, Intends to Regain Freedom to Build Ships</h3>
<p>(Paris) The British government recently sent a note to France, notifying them of the preliminary results of the British-German naval talks. This afternoon, Foreign Minister Laval, Navy Minister Pietri, and Navy Chief of Staff Douranvier met to discuss the response to Britain for a long time. It is reported that the French government will not refuse to consider allowing Germany a naval tonnage equal to 35% of Britain's. However, France cannot make a decision until the exact procedures for Germany's naval construction are clear, and Germany's request raises several practical issues in the naval field. These issues will be analyzed one by one in France's response. According to the 35% ratio requested by Germany, it applies not only to the total naval tonnage, but also to the tonnage of warships of all classes. If so, does this ratio refer to the tonnage of new ships built each year? In other words, is Germany's annual shipbuilding limited to 35% of Britain's shipbuilding tonnage during the same period? This is a question that must be clarified. If the 35% ratio claimed by Germany refers to the tonnage that should be available at present, rather than being built gradually over several years, it will inevitably raise some serious issues for other countries, because Germany's production capacity is extremely large. The Washington Naval Treaty stipulates that all French battleships should be limited to 35% of the tonnage of British battleships. If this ratio continues to be maintained, it is tantamount to acknowledging that German battleships are equal to French battleships. However, France has a very long coastline and its colonies are scattered all over the world. For the sake of special security, it is insufficient for French battleships to be equal to Germany. It is unknown how the French government plans to resolve this issue in its response. However, it is reported that if this issue cannot be agreed upon, France will act freely in building its navy after Germany obtains the 35% ratio, and will no longer be restricted by the Washington Naval Treaty. In addition, France has repeatedly proposed at the disarmament conference the principle that land, sea and air forces should be interconnected. This principle seems to be applicable to the naval negotiations with Germany, and it is believed that a treaty similar to the Sky Convention signed by the Locarno Treaty signatory countries can also be concluded on naval issues to seek a practical solution. (13th Havas)</p>
<h3>Pro-German Front Showing Instability; Parisian Public Opinion Deeply Suspicious</h3>
<p>(Paris) The newspaper "Le Temps" criticizes the changing trends of the British-German naval talks with harsh arguments, saying that the principles agreed upon in London seem to be a "special disturbance." The newspaper also said that if Germany is allowed to have a fleet equal to 35% of Britain's, then its strength will undoubtedly surpass the French fleet in the North Sea. Naval strength should not be discussed separately, because land, sea, and air forces depend on each other. This is a certain and unchangeable truth today. The indivisibility of the general restrictions on armaments announced in Geneva, London and Stresa is still valid. "Le Débat" also takes the same view and is extremely concerned about Britain's attitude, saying that Germany has won a new victory and its spiritual and political effects should not be underestimated. (14th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers belonging to political parties, from the far right to the far left, have expressed dissatisfaction with the British-German naval talks. They all say that France's coastline is longer than Germany's, and France has many overseas territories that must also be protected by a strong navy. If Germany is allowed a naval tonnage equal to 35% of the British navy, then the French and German navies will be in an equal position, which France cannot accept. The "Libre," a moderate Republican newspaper, reported, "The German navy is almost entirely composed of new warships, and it only needs to be concentrated in the Baltic and North Seas to be effective. In France, all the battleships were built before the European War, and its fleet must be distributed between the English Channel, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Because of these factors, although the French and German navies are said to be equal, in fact the German fleet is clearly superior to the French fleet. Is this what Britain originally wanted to achieve?" The royalist "Action Française" newspaper said that the naval agreement to be concluded by Britain and Germany will cause France to lose its maritime security. "Three or four years later, Germany's fleet in the North Sea will be equal to France's in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Once a war breaks out, France will have to withdraw its Mediterranean fleet, leaving the southern sea empty and undefended. How can this be allowed?" The communist "L'Humanité" newspaper said, "Britain and France signed a protocol on February 3, stipulating that Germany could only be granted the right to equal armaments after it had concluded a security pact. Subsequently, in April, the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations passed a resolution condemning Germany's unilateral abandonment of the treaty. These documents have barely dried before they have been forgotten." (14th Havas)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Express Gratification Over the Agreement Reached Between Britain and Germany on Naval Matters</h3>
<p>(London) The Times commented on the British-German naval talks, saying, "The Geneva Disarmament Conference brought together representatives from sixty countries and lasted for several years without achieving anything. Now the British and German representatives have reached a naval agreement in just a few days of talks. What a difference! And now that the government has completed this first step, it can continue to take the second step to conclude a Locarno Sky Convention. This is especially gratifying." All the newspapers expressed gratification over the conclusion of the British-German naval agreement. The Times is no exception. There are three reasons for this: first, the British-German naval competition will be eliminated from now on; second, British and German naval shipbuilding can be limited from now on; and third, this is the first step towards a general security organization. The newspaper also said that the British-German naval agreement is tantamount to tacitly abolishing the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and replacing them with a partial disarmament agreement. The News Chronicle has the same opinion, but the Daily Herald says that it is not appropriate to be too optimistic, as the British-American-Japanese naval talks last year can serve as a lesson.

<h3>Japan Insists on Original Position</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the British government inquired about Japan's intentions regarding the British-German talks. Therefore, Ambassador Matsudaira visited the British Foreign Secretary on the 13th based on instructions and presented the following reply:</p>
<p>(1) The British-German talks are a matter between Britain and Germany, and the Empire cannot raise any objections. (2) The Empire's position on naval disarmament, substantive disarmament, and the abolition of the ratio system remains unchanged. (3) The results of the British-German talks should not affect the abolition of the ratio system and other imperial claims. (14th Reuters)</p>
<h3>1936-7: A Crucial Year for World Peace and War—Observations by the Czech Foreign Minister—Close Cooperation Between Russia and Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, before his departure, met with journalists and said, "1936 and 1937 are the most important years. If we can safely get through these two years, then European peace can continue for a long time. My visit to the Soviet Union is the culmination of my many years of political activity. As early as 1919, I advocated cooperation with the Soviet Union. In 1929, when the world economic crisis began, the German National Socialist Party was also born at the same time. The necessity of cooperation was realized by us. Since the German government changed and attempted to undermine the European balance of power, the necessity of the Soviet Union's participation in European politics has become increasingly urgent. Political and economic accidents have made the threat of war more acute than before. Therefore, I vow to uphold the collective security system as the most effective means to eliminate this threat. On the battlefield for collective security, the interests and policies of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union are completely consistent. I firmly believe that the Soviet Union is a faithful supporter of the peace movement. It seeks peace, needs peace, and implements a genuine peace policy. Therefore, we are naturally happy to cooperate with the Soviet Union in foreign policy." Beneš also mentioned his impressions of the Soviet Union, saying, "I am amazed by the scale and speed of Soviet construction, and the great success and potential of various construction projects. The Soviet Union's infinite enthusiasm and vitality for work have given me a great impression. The Soviet people's love of work and creative enthusiasm are powerful factors in the peace movement." Beneš concluded, "The current situation in Europe continues to require us to work hard to organize collective security and strive to conduct consultations on security agreements." Beneš stayed in Leningrad for two days and returned to Moscow today and immediately left here for Kharkov, Kiev, and Prague. (14th Tavas)</p>

<p>(Paris) The "Paris Echo" diplomatic reporter Botina claims that France's response to the German memorandum is now complete and was drafted after consultation with the British and Italian governments. The content will deny the German memorandum's claim that the spirit of the Franco-Russian pact conflicts with the Locarno Treaty. Botina sharply criticized Foreign Minister Laval, saying that he made France's diplomacy obedient to Rome and London, allowing Britain and Italy to manipulate French diplomacy. The Locarno Treaty is actually the most difficult treaty to resolve. The Franco-Russian and Czech-Russian mutual assistance pacts are based on the League of Nations pact. Botina finally said that what is actually shaking is not French diplomacy, but the independence of the country. (14th National News)</p>

<h3>US Treasury Secretary Announces Maintenance of Domestic Silver Price; Silver Policy Depends on Supply and Demand; Silver-Supporting Congressmen Invited to Meeting in Washington</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, someone asked Treasury Secretary Morgenthau if the US Treasury Department would reduce the price of newly produced silver if the world silver price decreased. The Treasury Secretary replied that the domestic silver price would probably not change and said that he had invited silver-supporting members of Congress to a meeting to redefine the government's silver policy.</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told reporters here today that he had given Senator McCarran a very practical reply to his request that the authorities re-announce the silver purchase policy. The United States purchased less silver abroad in May than in April, but this cannot be taken to mean that the government has changed its overseas silver purchase policy. In summary, the Treasury Department's policy in the past few months has been based entirely on supply and demand. The silver-supporting senators are still not satisfied with the Treasury Secretary's remarks and have scheduled a meeting tomorrow to discuss future measures. (13th Reuters)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Union Association Agrees to Grant China a Permanent Seat on the Council; China with its Vast Territory and Population is the Most Suitable Representative of Asian Nations; Serious Situation in the Far East Makes Continued Contact Especially Indispensable</h3>
<p>The International Federation of League of Nations Associations recently held its 19th Congress here, and unanimously passed a resolution stating that it is extremely appropriate to grant China a permanent seat on the League of Nations Council, for the following reasons: (1) Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, there has been no appropriate representative of Asian nations on the Council; (2) China has a vast territory and population, the Chinese government is working hard on construction projects, and it is constantly cooperating with the League of Nations; (3) The nature of the Far East problem is serious, and there must be sustained contact between the League of Nations and China. The resolution also stated that after China obtains a permanent seat on the Council, the prestige of the Chinese government will naturally increase. Ling Qihan, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Belgium, recently thanked the Congress on behalf of the Chinese delegation, saying that if the League of Nations agrees to do so, China will be able to permanently and effectively cooperate with the cause of world peace.

<h3>Promotion of Labor Legislation Obstructed by Concession Authorities; Chinese Representative Speaks at International Labor Conference and Asks Representatives of Related Governments to Assist</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The International Labor Conference met today to discuss the report submitted by International Labor Office Director Bettler. Chinese government representative Li Pingheng spoke after representatives of other countries, praising the report submitted by Bettler, saying that it can provide an impartial observation of the world's economic trends. He then said, "The world economic panic has lasted for five years. Although all parties have tried their best to save it, the results obtained are very limited. The key lies in the reduction of consumption, which has led to an increasing number of unemployed. Therefore, the way to remedy this is to increase purchasing power. As far as we have heard, several countries have tried various methods to remedy this, such as organizing public works, reducing workers' working hours, organizing industries, and adopting various monetary policies. Although these methods have been slightly effective, these countries are experts in finding ways to increase purchasing power within their own national scope, and the effects they have achieved are naturally temporary and partial. Conversely, if countries can jointly agree to find ways to increase purchasing power within the scope of international cooperation, there is hope for a general economic recovery in the near future. As for China, although it currently faces various difficulties, it has never neglected its obligations to protect the working class. The Chinese government has repeatedly promulgated numerous pieces of social legislation, all of which are aimed at protecting the interests of workers. However, because the concession authorities of various countries in China refuse to allow the Chinese government to inspect the factories established by Chinese and foreigners in the concessions, labor legislation cannot be universally implemented, and the difficulties are very great." Finally, the Chinese representative requested representatives of the governments concerned and the International Labor Organization to assist China in this difficulty. (14th Havas)</p>

<h3>Germany's Largest Explosives Factory Explodes; Powerful Explosion Followed by a Large Fire; Fifty-Two Dead, Hundreds Injured; Cause of Accident Still Under Investigation; Third Incident Since 1917; National Airwaves Broadcast Dirges, Five Minutes of Silence Observed in Mourning</h3>
<p>(Wittenberg) A powerful explosion occurred at 3 PM today at an explosives factory in Ruhlsdorf near Wittenberg. A large portion of the explosives used by Germany's military comes from this factory. The cause of the accident is unknown. After the initial explosion, the fire spread to other buildings, leading to further explosions. The last explosion occurred at 6 PM. The affected area could not be approached until 8 PM. The number of dead and injured, as well as material losses, are still impossible to estimate. It is rumored that the number of dead may be as high as fifty, with even more injured. At 10 PM, the explosion was broadcast via radio, and the entire country observed five minutes of silence in mourning. Radio stations also replaced their evening music programs with dirges. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>It is reported that this factory is the only explosives factory permitted by the Treaty of Versailles. It primarily manufactures gunpowder and explosives. Recently, the factory has been operating day and night, employing 7,000 workers, divided into three shifts, rotating in turn. There were two previous explosions in 1917 and 1925. This is the third incident, with the first being the most serious. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Wittenberg) According to official reports, the explosion at the Ruhlsdorf explosives factory resulted in a total of 52 deaths. However, residents of nearby villages estimate that the actual number of deaths is much higher. In 1915, the factory experienced a similar explosion, resulting in approximately 500 deaths, while the official report only listed 50. Furthermore, two shifts of workers were present in the factory last night when the explosion occurred, indicating that the number of deaths is definitely more than a few dozen. Today, police surrounded the entire town of Ruhlsdorf, preventing journalists from accessing the site of the explosion. Two journalists who attempted to approach the factory were arrested and detained for several hours before being released. The cause of the explosion remains unclear. Führer Hitler has allocated 100,000 marks to aid the families of the victims. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Wittenberg) Yesterday afternoon, a series of explosions occurred at the Westphalian explosives factory in Ruhlsdorf, three miles from here. Authorities estimate that approximately 50 people died, 75 were seriously injured, and dozens suffered minor injuries. Germany's largest and most modern explosives factory has been destroyed as a result. Many nearby houses have collapsed, and not a single windowpane within a few miles is intact. Ambulances have been running for hours, rescuing injured workers and transporting them to a poorly equipped hospital. Nurses and doctors from the Red Cross in nearby towns have all come to assist in the treatment. According to authorities, the cause of the explosion is still under investigation. The fire started first, followed by the explosions. The first explosion occurred at 3 PM, and the explosions continued until 8 PM. At that time, the sound reverberated far and wide, and debris from bricks and machinery flew through the sky within a three-mile radius. The flames from the factory could be seen miles away. Rescue teams are rescuing the dead and injured, facing great danger, but all are acting bravely and without hesitation. Currently, disregarding relatives, when the police drove away the wives, children, and mothers of the victims, the scene was too tragic to bear. Initially, rumors spread that the number of deaths was between 500 and 1,500, but after investigation, it was found that only 300 people were working in the factory when the accident occurred. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Wittenberg) Since the explosion at the Ruhlsdorf explosives factory, a total of 22 bodies have been recovered. 30 people are still missing and are unlikely to be found alive. In addition, 75 people have been seriously injured, and 300 have suffered minor injuries. Most of those with minor injuries will be able to return to work after a few days of recovery. The initially reported extent of the explosion was exaggerated, as only part of the factory was affected. Most of the buildings suffered only minor surface damage. The local authorities' swift and courageous response, as well as the people's calm spirit after the accident, have been widely praised. Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Labor Front leader Ley have sent telegrams expressing their condolences. Ley also remitted 50,000 marks in relief funds and ordered all Labor Front offices to fly flags at half-mast until the day of the funeral for the deceased. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Ambition to Swallow Abyssinia; Plans to Reduce it to a Protectorate; No Other Country Allowed to Interfere in Abyssinian Territory; Italian Commoners Relocating Elsewhere</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources, Italy is currently planning to reduce Abyssinia to a protectorate. According to the plan, King Selassie of Abyssinia would retain his throne. Another reliable source states that Abyssinia is willing to cede the Ogaden region, which is currently a source of conflict, to Italy and incorporate it into the Italian Somaliland territory. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign sources rumor that Italy intends to propose at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on August 25th to divide Abyssinia into protectorates of Britain, France, and Italy, and to cede the Ogaden province of Abyssinia to Italy. Officials have recently denied this, stating that Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, is currently here and has not brought any proposals from Britain regarding the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. (Havas News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Addis Ababa, Abyssinia) Most of the Italian nationals within Abyssinia have already left the country and gone to Italian Eritrea. The remaining are preparing to leave by mid-month. To avoid incidents, the Abyssinian government has ordered provincial governors to deploy troops to protect European nationals in the Abyssinian interior when necessary. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a report from a correspondent in Rome, he spoke with Mussolini, who said that the Abyssinian issue would soon be properly resolved. Italy has recently taken military action to prevent the expansion of the incident, but is now willing to submit the Walwal incident to arbitration. However, Mussolini pointed out that the Abyssinian army has been trained by European officers since 1929 and has formed a new army. Therefore, its threat to Italian colonies is not only temporary, but its danger will also increase day by day. Italy is a country with organizational capabilities and maintains peace, as can be seen from the current situation in Libya. Finally, Mussolini stated that the key to the East African issue depends entirely on the attitude of European countries and whether they have genuine friendship with Italy. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The anti-British movement in the press, which has been very enthusiastic in the past few weeks, is now gradually subsiding due to Britain's reserved attitude towards the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. It is generally believed that Britain's reserved attitude is influenced by France. Political circles here have expressed satisfaction with this and seized the opportunity to declare that Italy's actions will not weaken Britain's power in the Red Sea. It is also learned that if the British government avoids intervention, the Italian government will probably not refuse to negotiate the division of spheres of influence. However, the current rumor that negotiations are already underway cannot be confirmed. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Premier Advocates Restoration; Plans to Support a Descendant of the Árpád Dynasty as King; This Move Could Prevent Austro-Hungarian Merger; Little Entente Would Not Be Offended</h3>
<p>The Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös declared in parliament today, "I wish to see a 'national king' emerge in Hungary and ascend the throne. The main responsibility of this national king is to safeguard the interests of the Hungarian nation. The most suitable person to be the national king is a descendant of the Árpád dynasty. However, the issue of Hungarian restoration must be resolved after reaching an agreement with other countries." After Gömbös finished speaking, the entire venue applauded for a long time. Árpád was the conqueror of Hungary in the 10th century. His rule ended in the 14th century. Today, Archduke Albrecht, a direct descendant of the Árpád dynasty, is a branch of the former Austro-Hungarian Habsburg imperial family. Born in 1897, he is the son of Duke of Teschen. In 1930, he married the divorced wife of a Hungarian diplomat. At that time, he issued a declaration recognizing Duke Otto as the legitimate heir to the Habsburg imperial family. Albrecht is friendly with Prime Minister Gömbös. Gömbös has advocated for Albrecht to be crowned King of Hungary for several years. This morning, Albrecht and Gömbös spoke for a long time. Afterwards, the government issued an order promoting Albrecht to lieutenant colonel in the army reserve. If Albrecht is crowned king, the backlash caused in the countries of the Little Entente would not be as severe as the restoration of the Austrian Habsburg imperial family. If Duke Otto, the legitimate heir to the Habsburg imperial family, were crowned King of Austria, it is feared that it would restore the Austro-Hungarian joint rule and demand the restoration of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Conversely, if the Árpád dynasty is restored in Hungary, it can prevent the merger of Austria and Hungary. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Switzerland's Relationship with Germany</h3>
<p>(Bern, Switzerland) Swiss Federal Council President Minger recently declared in the House of Representatives, "Our country's relationship with Germany is trending towards normalization. We will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, nor will we allow other countries to interfere in our internal affairs. Recently, regarding the case of German journalist Berthold Jacob being kidnapped by the Nazi Party in Switzerland, Germany has accepted arbitration without reservation, which proves that Germany is determined to maintain a correct relationship with Switzerland. As for Hitler's Pan-Germanism, it should not apply to Switzerland. It is our hope that Hitler's attitude towards Austria will be the same as his attitude towards Switzerland."

<h3>National Recovery Administration (NRA) Skeleton Bill Stalled in US House of Representatives; Likely to be Submitted to Joint Committee of Both Houses for Vote; Agricultural Adjustment Act Expected to be Amended and Passed</h3>
<p>(Washington) The NRA skeleton bill failed to pass the amended version already passed by the Senate today due to Republican obstruction in the House of Representatives. Therefore, this bill is bound to be submitted to a joint committee of both houses. President Roosevelt has previously indicated his willingness to accept the amendments proposed by the Senate, stipulating that automatic industry regulations must include collective bargaining, minimum wages, maximum working hours, and the prohibition of child labor and unfair business practices; otherwise, antitrust laws will remain in effect. At the same time, President Roosevelt also told Democratic leaders that he hopes that the fourteen necessary bills will be passed as soon as possible. Among them, four bills, namely the recovery bill, the industrial disputes bill, the Guffey Coal Act, and the extension of transportation cooperatives, must be passed as soon as possible. If the transportation cooperatives are not passed, 50,000 road workers will face unemployment tomorrow, and a coal strike is brewing. Therefore, the Guffey Coal Act also needs to be established urgently. In addition, the Public Utility Holding Company Act, the Banking Act, the Social Security Act, and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration Act are also necessary bills to be passed. Since Congress has many important bills that need to be processed urgently, there is no hope of adjourning soon. The Public Utility Holding Company Act is still stalled in the House of Representatives. Observing the trend in the House of Representatives, if the Republicans do not support it, this bill will fail. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) House Agriculture Committee Chairman Jones stated today that the House will formally pass the amendment to the Agricultural Adjustment Act tomorrow. Jones said that the mandatory licensing and various price regulation clauses in the amendment will be completely removed, and the powers of Agriculture Secretary Wallace will be clearly stipulated.

<h3>Strange Tale of a Mother Cat Nursing Mice</h3>
<p>TASS Moscow Dispatch, May 24th - Professor Mantafel, director of the Moscow Zoo, reported an interesting experiment, in which a cat, in addition to raising her own kittens, also nursed several mice. When the professor uncovered the nest of the mice, he found nine blind mice. The professor and several young natural scientists, because the matter was strange, decided to conduct an experiment to see if the cat would nurse them. As a result, when the cat smelled the group of mice, she immediately went to them. The professor said that animals rely on their sense of smell more than their sense of sight, so this is because the scent of the mice is not much different.</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Postal Law and Holds Closed Meeting to Review the Sino-French Vietnam Convention; All Articles Passed Except for Two with Additional Suggestions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Legislative Yuan's plenary session on the 14th, during the review of the Postal Law, Jiao Yitang and Wu Shangying first reported on the review process, stating briefly: (1) On the issue of postal rate determination, scholars from various countries hold differing opinions. The Yuan had previously questioned the Executive Yuan regarding postal rate increases. Therefore, it seems appropriate to investigate the precedents in various countries to determine whether postal rate determination should be stipulated by national law or determined independently by postal authorities. After detailed research into the postal regulations of various countries, the review opinion still favors legal stipulation as more appropriate. However, the Ministry of Communications requested that only the postage for letters and postcards be stipulated by law, while the Ministry of Communications would be authorized to determine the rest. How should this be handled? Please discuss it among yourselves. (2) Regarding the tax exemption for postal public property and the business documents of postal organizations, the provisions were made in compromise with the opinions of the Ministries of Communications and Finance, as well as the Finance Committee of this Yuan. (3) The penalty clauses in the Postal Law have been revised based on the new Criminal Law. In addition, the central government originally stipulated that railways, long-distance buses, ships, and aircraft engaged in transportation are responsible for carrying mail and its processing personnel. Except for aircraft, all are to be carried free of charge in principle. However, the Ministry of Railways insists that it has suffered significant losses in the past carrying mail and strongly disagrees with this point. The Ministry of Communications also provided some answers, but no resolution has been reached. How should this law be stipulated? Please also discuss it in the General Assembly. The second reading then began. Except for Article 4, which stipulated the postal rates, there was some debate. In the end, it was decided to follow the original plan and provide detailed regulations in this law. As for Article 15, regarding the free carriage of mail by transportation agencies or carriers, the opinions of the various committees diverged. The chairman submitted the article for a vote five times, but all failed to reach the required quorum. As a result, the chairman reserved the article and entrusted it to Jiao Yitang, Wu Shangying, Xi Chaojun, Wei Tingsheng, and Zheng Hongnian for review, with a decision to continue the discussion in the afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan continued its discussion of the Postal Law at 2:30 PM on the 14th. Jiao Yitang and others proposed an amendment to Article 15: all railways, long-distance buses, ships, and aircraft engaged in transportation are responsible for carrying mail and its processing personnel. The aforementioned carriage, except for aircraft, is free of charge, but the Ministry of Communications may provide subsidies. For subsidies to privately operated transportation businesses, a consultation method may be adopted, and if the consultation fails, the Ministry of Communications will make the decision. Without any objections, the amendment was passed on the second reading. All articles from Article 16 onwards were passed, except for the deletion of the former Articles 8, 49, and 51. The entire bill, consisting of 50 articles, was omitted and passed on the third reading. (3) The Organic Regulations of the Yangtze Coal and Water Conservancy Commission; (4) The Organic Regulations of the North China Water Conservancy Commission; (5) The Organic Law of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission; (6) The Organic Regulations of the Huai River Guidance Commission. It was resolved that the above four cases be amended and passed according to the results of the review. The main points of the four cases are that each committee is directly subordinate to the National Economic Council and is responsible for water conservancy affairs. The chairman and vice-chairman of the Yellow River and Huai River Guidance Commissions are specially appointed, while the others are simply appointed. The Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission stipulates that it will be established in Xijing, while the others have not yet been determined. (7) The Provisional Regulations of the Commercial Dispute Resolution Committee; (8) The Provisional Regulations of the Maritime Dispute Resolution Committee. It was resolved that the above two cases be submitted for review. (9) The Amendment to Article 12 of the Organic Law of the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications. It was resolved that it be passed according to the results of the review. After the discussion of the routine cases was completed, a closed meeting was held to review the Sino-French Vietnam Convention. It was reported that, as a result, the Legislative Yuan suggested that the central government adopt only certain two issues, and the rest were passed according to the original plan. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Postal Law passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 14th stipulates that domestic mail is no different from the current measures of the Ministry of Communications. Mongolia and Xinjiang are also handled in accordance with the examples of other provinces. International mail is still subject to the provisions of the International Postal Convention or Agreement. In addition, the law stipulates matters such as postal business procedures and penalties. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Heads South to Request Instructions on Future Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Policy; He Makes Proper Arrangements for Military and Political Stability Before Leaving Beiping; Local Resolution of the Situation in Eastern Chahar Begins to Appear</h3>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Sino-Japanese diplomacy has been in negotiations for a year, fluctuating between tension and relaxation, without reaching a proper resolution. Our side has adopted a peaceful approach, gradually resolving outstanding issues within the realm of possibility. The Japanese diplomatic side seems to be advancing along diplomatic lines with a slow and steady policy. However, the young and radical faction within the military strongly advocates for rapid progress, viewing the ongoing negotiations as snail-paced and impatient. After much deliberation, the Hebei problem arose. After the incident, our side intended to resolve it through normal diplomatic channels, but the young and radical military faction of the Japanese side declared that this was not within the scope of diplomacy but rather a military matter, and they were willing to adopt rapid measures. Our authorities, adhering to the usual peaceful approach, engaged in negotiations. Since the Japanese side raised the issue on the 30th of last month, through negotiations, all the points the Japanese side hoped for have been automatically implemented within the realm of possibility. The provincial government has been relocated, Yu Xuezhong has been transferred to the post of Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu Border Region, the 50th Army under his command has been transferred to Shaanxi to suppress bandits, the Tianjin Municipal Government has been reorganized, the Hebei-Tianjin Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters have been dissolved, and the Central Army stationed in Beiping has been transferred to other locations with clear orders to foster friendly relations. All these measures have been properly handled, and on the 10th, a response was given to the Japanese side, accommodating the points they hoped for. The Japanese side has also generally understood the measures taken by our authorities. The other day, Doihara and others arrived in Lüshun and convened a meeting to discuss the situation. The true intention of the Japanese side is to elevate the political power in North China, making the military and political relationship in North China slightly different than before. In the future, there may be minor changes in the political situation in Beiping.</p>
<p>Chairman He believes that Sino-Japanese negotiations have made considerable progress, making it necessary to report to the central government and request instructions. Furthermore, since the occurrence of the Hebei problem, the points the Japanese side hoped for have been verbally proposed by Sakai, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army Headquarters in Tianjin, and our side has also responded verbally. Therefore, he decided to make a trip south in person. Yesterday afternoon, he sent Zhu Shidong to notify Takahashi, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, to inform him of the significance of his trip south and to declare that the matters decided in the oral negotiations would still be handled as scheduled and gradually completed. That evening at 8 o'clock, he met with Qin Dechun, who had come from Chahar, to discuss matters in Chahar. At around 10 o'clock, he invited important members of the Military Affairs Commission such as Bao Wen Yue, Wan Fulin, Rong Zhen, Wang Shuchang, Qin Dechun, and Men Zhizhong to Jurentang for a meeting to discuss the handling of the duties of the Military Affairs Commission during his absence. The routine duties of the Military Affairs Commission will be handled by Bao Wen Yue on his behalf. Minor matters will be discussed and handled jointly by the standing committee members. If there are important matters, they will be telegraphed directly to the central government for instructions. The standing committee members of the Military Affairs Commission were originally Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Shang Zhen, and Jiang Bocheng. Now that Jiang is in Guangdong and Shang has gone to Tianjin, the number of members is too small, so Qin Dechun, Ji Yiqiao, Hu Yukun, Men Zhizhong, Rong Zhen, and Wei Zonghan were added as standing committee members to assist Wan and others in handling urgent and important matters. Bao Wen Yue will convene meetings at any time. After the arrangements for the affairs of the Military Affairs Commission were completed, he summoned the Mayor of Beiping, Yuan Liang, and the Commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, Wang Shuchang, to discuss the security of Beiping and Tianjin, and gave instructions. He assigned Yuan Liang the responsibility for the security of Beiping. After all arrangements were completed, this morning (the 13th) at 2:30 AM, he boarded the prepared special train to head south, accompanied by his wife, Wang Wenxiang, his chief secretary, Xie Boyuan, his secretary, Zeng Jingcang, his adjutant, Wang Guozhong, and a telegraph operator. The trip is scheduled for one week, but whether it will be extended is currently undecided. After He left Beiping, Bao Wen Yue convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission personnel at 9 AM today to report the reasons for He's trip south and the handling of the duties of the Military Affairs Commission, and instructed all members to work as usual. Yuan Liang, who is responsible for the security of Beiping, also summoned the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Yu Jinhe, and the leaders of various districts to the municipal government yesterday morning to give instructions on how to maintain local security in the future. At 10 AM, Wan Fulin and Wang Shuchang visited Yuan at the municipal government to discuss the security issues in Beiping. At 2 PM, Yu Jinhe drafted a plan to maintain security and convened an emergency meeting of key officials to decide on the implementation plan. The military attaché of the Japanese embassy, Takahashi, also visited Yuan Liang this morning and stated that if there were any disturbances caused by Japanese ronin and illegal Koreans in Beiping during this period, the embassy would definitely assist in cracking down. The First Division and the Twenty-fifth Division of the Central Army stationed in Beiping and its suburbs have completely moved south today. The security within the city is the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau under the command of the municipal government. The security in the four suburbs, in addition to the police, is jointly maintained by a part of the constabulary dispatched by the Constabulary Headquarters. The local area is as peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>Japanese military officers responsible for negotiations in Beiping and Tianjin held a meeting in Tianjin yesterday. Tonight, they are still gathering in Tianjin for further discussions. Sakanishi, who arrived in Beiping, went to Tianjin at 3 PM to participate. According to Takahashi's conversation with reporters this morning, the Tianjin meeting did not produce any important resolutions. The Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation is now tending towards reconciliation. A squadron of Japanese aircraft will come to Beiping purely for reconnaissance purposes. Chairman He's trip south is to report on the progress of the Hebei problem negotiations, and so on.</p>
<p>After the Japanese military exercises in eastern Chahar, the Zhangbei incident occurred. The Japanese side claimed that there were detailed inspections and disrespectful actions towards the Japanese, and protested, making several demands. After Chairman He left Beiping, this matter will be resolved by the Chahar authorities through negotiations with the Japanese side. The two sides are not far apart in their opinions, and it is expected to be resolved within days. (Reported on June 13th)</p>

<h3>Food Panic in Jiangxi Province: A Combination of Banditry, Drought, and Rural Bankruptcy; Farmers Often Eat Grass Roots and Tree Leaves to Survive</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi was originally an important rice-producing area in our country. According to general estimates, excluding miscellaneous grains, the annual output is 70 million dan. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the export of rice reached over 8.49 million customs taels. Since then, banditry has spread, with two-thirds of the total area falling into the hands of bandits. The vast rural areas have been the primary target of Red Bandit destruction and subversion. Thirty million people in Jiangxi are living in the midst of years of bandit disasters, coupled with last year's unprecedented drought. The land is barren for thousands of miles, and the people are impoverished. The subsidiary industries that used to rely on agricultural products, such as bamboo, wood, hemp, tea, paper, summer cloth, tobacco leaves, oil, etc., have been shattered by foreign economic attacks, leaving nothing behind. Therefore, the province has suffered a widespread and severe rice famine due to the combination of banditry, drought, and rural bankruptcy. In the Jiujiang, Hukou, Ruichang, and Duchang areas of northern Jiangxi, rice prices soared after the autumn harvest last year, and it became impossible to buy rice even with money in the winter. The newly recovered areas in southern and western Jiangxi rely entirely on foreign rice for supply, and even safe areas do not have enough rice to eat. Even the most prosperous areas in eastern Jiangxi, such as Linchuan, Dongxiang, and Guanjiang, farmers have mostly put down their sickles and have no rice to cook. At this time when the old crop is exhausted and the new crop has not yet arrived, on average, no more than 20-30% of farmers have grain to eat. Elm tree leaves, Guanyin clay, bitter vegetable roots, wild bracken, and wild grass roots are the only food for the poor to mix with bran. It is unspeakably miserable. According to letters from various places, the price of rice is around 12 yuan per dan. It is not absolutely unavailable, but farmers cannot afford to buy it in this bankrupt state, even if the price is only two or three yuan per dan. Therefore, the widespread bankruptcy of the national economy is even more worrying than the temporary rice shortage. The provincial party headquarters and provincial and municipal chambers of commerce once had a food association organization, which planned to obtain loans from banks and ask the Ministry of Finance to issue tax-exempt rice permits to transport foreign rice for price stabilization. Even if this is successful in the future, only cities and towns will benefit, and the vast number of farmers will still be left wanting. Currently, except for the riverside villages that have benefited slightly from summer crops such as rapeseed, wheat, peas, and broad beans, the rest are eagerly awaiting the early rice harvest to save their lives. It is still a month and a half away from the harvest (Great Heat), and I really don't know how to survive during this month and a half. (June 11th)</p>

For a time, the sound of gunfire on the lake was incessant. One small boat was sunk. The fleeing soldiers did not fire a single shot, only firing a volley when fleeing to Motan, before wading away. Because it was late at night, the route was unclear, and they were not pursued.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: A Monk Beaten to Death for Lusting After Women</h3>
<p>Ciyun Temple, a well-known large monastery in this county, has many monks. Usually, it has a wealthy income, and the temple is beautifully decorated with secret rooms. Last year, County Magistrate Yang Zhanchun personally led a police brigade to search the temple, seizing a large number of smoking paraphernalia, gambling instruments, and women's underwear and cosmetics. He then ordered it to be sealed off. Unexpectedly, after a short time, the monks returned to their old ways. The other day, Bao Shun, the 31-year-old abbot of the Dongfang Zhangfang, openly seduced two women from good families and went to a fake hotel in Songjiang for a secret rendezvous. This was discovered by local ruffians, who followed them to a secluded place and beat them severely with their fists. The monk returned to Jiashan injured by car. As soon as he arrived at the Jiashan station, his face turned pale, and he spat out fresh blood and died. The station telegraphed the county court to send someone for examination. Prosecutor Zhu led police officers to conduct an autopsy, confirming that he had died from poisoning. An order was issued to the local police to prepare a coffin for burial. At about 5 PM, the deceased's brother, Lu Lianfu, requested the court to have his family claim the body. It is learned that the deceased was the sixth son of Lu Zihe, a wealthy man from Datangkou by the lake, and was studying at the Yuankahui Shunkang Silk Shop. The reason for his suicide is unknown.

It is now learned that on the 13th, detectives arrested Lu Jiasheng, a notorious bandit, and Shen Hongsheng, a suspect, at the Deli Hotel in Dongmen. After interrogation, Lu confessed that he was 40 years old, from Chongde County, and had committed many crimes.

He also robbed Yuxian Shen Baocheng's dry goods store of silver and valuables from the Gaojia Shiqiao Gao family. In January of this year, he kidnapped a young master of a butcher shop from Youguang Bridge (who has not yet been redeemed).

<h3>Reception Committee of Seventeen Organizations Hosted a Farewell Banquet for the U.S. Economic Mission Last Night, Over 260 Guests and Hosts Attended, Each Member of the Mission Received a Silver Pagoda</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the reception committee comprised of seventeen organizations hosted a grand banquet at the International Hotel last night at 8:00 PM to bid farewell to the U.S. Economic Mission. Chairman Chen Zeqing delivered a speech and presented each member of the mission with a silver pagoda as a memento. Forbes responded with a thank-you speech. Over two hundred guests attended, and the atmosphere was very cheerful. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Guests and Hosts The banquet was held at 8:00 PM last night in the banquet hall on the second floor of the International Hotel, with music provided by the hotel's orchestra. The guests and hosts attending the banquet included all members of the Economic Mission, as well as Wu Tiecheng, Chen Zeqing, Guo Bingwen, Xu Xinliu, He Bingxian, Wang Boqi, Cao Yunxiang, Pan Guangjiong, He Dekui, Wang Xiaolai, Jin Luqin, Xia Xiaofang, Jing Zhongxiu, Xu Shanxiang, Zhang Xianglin, Wen Yuqing, Yang Guangxing, Li Dachao, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Zengji, Xu Peihuang, Yang Hu, Ma Yinchu, Wu Liande, Wu Yunzhai, Xi Demao, Shen Shuyu, Tang Baoshu, Xi Jiming, Lu Ganchen, Liu Zhanen, Li Quanshi, Zhu Shaoping, Ma Yinliang, He Xiya, Zeng Xubai, and others, totaling over 260 people. Chairman Chen Zeqing presided.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech During the seating, Chairman Chen Zeqing stood up and delivered a speech, saying, "Distinguished members of the U.S. Economic Mission and honored guests, it is my great honor to represent the reception committee and various Shanghai organizations to say a few words to you tonight. You have traveled far across the ocean, enduring fatigue, to conduct investigations in various parts of our country and delve into the interior, staying for as long as two months. This is greatly appreciated and admired by the people of our country. However, I apologize for any inadequacies in our hospitality. Your visit for investigation coincides with the most severe period of our country's economic situation. Therefore, we can receive more guidance from you. Regarding the silver issue and its impact on China's interests, you have already conducted thorough research, so I need not elaborate. However, I must say that at this initial stage of our country's economic construction, the implementation of your country's silver policy has had some impact on various sectors in our country. The relationship between China and the United States has always been strong, and we sincerely hope that the members of the mission can pay close attention to this. After your investigations in various parts of our country's interior, you have expressed optimism about the future of our country's construction. The people of our country are very pleased to hear this and will work even harder. However, in recent years, unexpected obstacles and unfortunate events have occurred from time to time, dealing a blow to the construction efforts. I believe that this situation is well known to you and that you have shown sympathy. Construction is closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. On behalf of various organizations, I would like to express our sincere feelings to you and hope for your guidance. The purpose of your visit to China is very significant, and your attitude is very sincere, which is deeply appreciated by the people of our country. Increased trade between the two countries depends on mutual benefit. If Country A can purchase more goods from Country B, Country B will have more capacity to purchase goods from Country A. This principle is understood by all economists. However, in recent years, most countries in the world have built high walls to reject imports from other countries while hoping that their own goods can sell well in other countries. This has led to a gradual decline in the total volume of world trade today. When you came to China, you repeatedly stated that the principle is to increase trade mutually, which is very welcome to the people of our country. However, how to make this principle, which contains profound truth, deeply understood and realized by all parties still requires the efforts and clarification of all parties. Finally, I would like to add that the notification period for your mission's proposed visit to China was very short. Therefore, the reception was not fully prepared, and various parties were not fully aware of the purpose of your investigation, resulting in inadequate preparation of materials, etc. However, the seriousness and the length of time you spent on the investigation in our country have greatly impressed the people of our country. It can be said with certainty that the results of this investigation will bring great satisfaction to both China and the United States. However, since you are all busy people, I believe that the positive results of this investigation should be followed up by a concrete organization to ensure that your enthusiasm is not interrupted due to a lack of successors. I sincerely hope that your mission can consider this suggestion. Finally, on behalf of the entire reception committee and various Shanghai organizations, I would like to express my gratitude to the members of the mission. The colleagues of the reception committee have also prepared a small souvenir as a farewell gift. I wish you all good health and a safe journey."</p>
<p>Mission Leader's Thank-You Speech Following this, the leader of the U.S. Economic Mission, Forbes, responded with a thank-you speech, stating, "During this visit to your country, my colleagues and I have been deeply grateful for your warm hospitality and the provision of many materials. This trip has lasted two months, and we deeply appreciate your country's abundant resources and the thriving progress of various facilities. As we are about to return home, we sincerely hope to bring back the findings of this investigation and the opinions of various sectors in your country to my country, so that we may use them as a basis for developing Sino-American trade. I would like to raise my glass to thank you for your hospitality and wish all of you good health."</p>
<p>Scheduled Return Banquet After the meal, dancing began, and the guests and hosts chatted happily, creating a harmonious atmosphere. The event ended at midnight. In addition, the experts' meeting, originally scheduled to end yesterday afternoon, was extended because of the need to make concrete summaries of the various materials. Therefore, the final joint meeting was held again yesterday evening at 5:00 PM to summarize and conclude the issues discussed in the past. The content will be published in the coming days. The mission, in order to thank us for our hospitality, will host a banquet for the entire reception committee on the evening of the 17th.</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau News: Southbound Passengers Not Crowded, Northbound Passengers Not Decreasing</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Shipping Industry Association: Members' General Meeting Resolutions: Internal Retrenchment, 20% Reduction in Crew Salaries, Request Government to Expedite Allocation of 10 Million Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association held a temporary members' general meeting at 3:00 PM on June 11th at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. Sixty-one representatives from thirty-four companies, including Sanbei, Ningshao, and Zhengji, attended. Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Wang Boling were elected as the presidium, and Zhu Shuwu was the recorder. Three important resolutions were passed, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Yu Qiaqing reported, "Today, we are convening this temporary members' general meeting due to the impact of the market on our industry to discuss ways to maintain ourselves. We plan to proceed in three steps: first, internal retrenchment, starting with reducing expenses; second, requesting the government to provide relief as soon as possible; and third, we should ask everyone to discuss this at length. The number of representatives present today is sufficient to meet the quorum. Please express your opinions as much as possible. Regarding the second step, our association has already appealed to the government authorities in accordance with the resolution of the 32nd Executive Committee meeting, requesting the expedited allocation of the originally approved 10 million yuan shipping industry public bonds, which has not yet been approved. Should we urge its implementation? This matter is extremely important and should be decided by the general meeting."</p>
<p>Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>The following resolutions were passed at the general meeting: (1) Crew salaries should be paid at 80% of the standard. Each company should handle this standard on its own discretion, effective from July 1st. When the market stabilizes and freight rates recover, the original full salary will be paid. The association will notify all members to comply and will also send letters to the Seamen's Union and the Engineers' and Mechanics' Association, explaining the shipping companies' efforts to maintain operations and asking for their understanding and acceptance. (2) Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Yang Guanbei, Wang Zigang, Yao Shumin, Chen Jisheng, Zhou Zian, Lu Yigeng, and Ye Chuanfang were elected as representatives specifically responsible for requesting the issuance of shipping industry public bonds. These nine individuals will mutually elect three representatives to petition the government and urge its implementation. (3) Draft a declaration for publication in newspapers to appeal for national unity and assistance. (The declaration has been published in yesterday's newspaper advertising column, omitted here.)</p>
<h3>The Crisis in the Cotton Spinning and Weaving Industry Deepens: Chinese-Owned Mills Suffering Losses, Japanese-Owned Mills Making Huge Profits</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the sluggish market and the dumping of foreign yarn, Chinese-owned cotton mills are experiencing declining business, reduced working hours, and shutdowns, which has become a widespread problem. Only Japanese-owned mills are able to make profits. According to sources in the cotton industry, Tongxing Cotton Mill, a Japanese-owned mill, earned a profit of 732,000 yuan in the first half of this year, ending in April. The reason is that the 40-count double-strand yarn and shirting produced by the mill meet market demand. During this period, the mill spun 20,800 bales of yarn and wove 451,700 pieces of cotton cloth. The mill has two factories in Shanghai, with a total of 98,000 spindles and 30,240 thread spindles. Due to the adoption of the Changshen system and automated weaving machines in previous years, production efficiency has increased dramatically and costs have been reduced. At the same time, the mill plans to establish a branch factory in Qingdao, with an estimated 30,000 spindles and 1,150 looms. The factory base is currently under construction, and all the machines have been ordered from domestic sources. In addition, Japanese-owned mills such as Rihua are also able to make profits. Although Chinese-owned mills want to improve production efficiency, they are constrained by economic conditions and cannot compete with them. If this continues, Chinese-owned cotton spinning and weaving mills will inevitably be defeated by Japanese-owned mills. The crisis is truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Dutch-Indonesian Refugees Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Dutch ship "Chisadane" of the Java Shipping Company is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 PM today, carrying more than 110 Chinese refugees who have been forced to leave. The ship will dock at the Yulan Chimney Wharf in Pudong. Yesterday, inquiries were made to the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. According to the bureau, it is feared that these are Chinese returning from Canada, as that country is forcing all Chinese to return to their home countries within two years. The situation in the Dutch East Indies seems similar. However, as the ship has not yet arrived in Shanghai and the bureau has not received any telegram reports, the details are not yet known. The bureau will send Tan Zhonglu and Hou Can to the wharf to take care of everything.</p>
<h3>Polish Journalist Couple Circumnavigating the Far East on Motorized Bicycles, a Grand Feat, Has Traveled from India Directly to Burma, a Journey of Over 12,000 Miles</h3>
<p>The Polish journalist and sports expert, Mr. and Mrs. Pozerski, are undertaking the grand feat of circumnavigating the Far East on motorized bicycles. They departed from Warsaw, the capital of Poland, in the spring, passing through Berlin, Vienna, Bourglane, Sofia, Constantinople, Ankara, Aleppo, Baghdad, Tehran, Delhi, Bombay, Benares, Calcutta, Rangoon, Mandalay, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and finally Shanghai. Throughout the journey, they relied entirely on their motorized bicycles as transportation. In early May, Mr. and Mrs. Pozerski safely arrived in Bombay. They departed from Bombay on May 3rd and safely arrived in Calcutta on May 20th. After resting there briefly, they departed on the 24th, heading directly to Rangoon. The exact date of their arrival in Shanghai is not yet known. To date, the distance traveled by the couple on their motorized bicycles has reached 12,000 miles, which is also a grand feat.</p>
<h3>Isoya Returns to Shanghai from Qingdao Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Isoya, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, traveled north with the embassy secretary Mr. Motono at the beginning of the month to meet with the Japanese military authorities stationed in Tianjin to discuss liaison matters. He also paid a visit to He Yingqin, the acting chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, to discuss matters. He completed his official duties a few days ago and traveled south to Jinan, then went to Qingdao, and took the Qingdao Maru back to Shanghai. He arrived here at about 4:30 PM yesterday and docked at the Huangpu Wharf in Yangshupu. Those who went to welcome him included Mr. Ashino, the head of the information department of the Japanese Embassy, and the military attaché, Mr. Kagesa, and many others. After Isoya disembarked, he went directly to the military attaché's office on Laobazi Road to rest. According to Isoya and Motono, during the voyage, they told Japanese reporters that the purpose of their trip to the north was to discuss liaison matters with the Japanese troops stationed in North China. The Hebei incident has been completely resolved, and Pingjin is currently very peaceful. As for the rumors that the Japanese side has made new demands, Isoya and Motono both stated that they had not heard of them.</p>

<p>Following the implementation of centralized collection and transfer by the banking and money industries, both industries have found it convenient. The Money Industry Supervision Committee met yesterday afternoon and approved the amount of collateral borrowed by the money industry, totaling over 24 million yuan. Once the Loan Committee agrees, financial public bonds can be fully redeemed for cash to aid industry and commerce through loans, which will continue to be implemented. The details are reported by a Xinxin News Agency reporter as follows:</p>
<p>Supervision Committee Meeting Held Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Supervision Committee of the Ministry of Finance held a meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday at the Money Industry Reserve Depository on Ningbo Road. Xu Kan, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Gu Yigu, Xu Baoqi, Hu Meian, Shi Jiu'ao, Wang Zisong, and others attended. During the meeting, the various batches of collateral sent by the various firms were continuously reviewed, as some of the collateral previously reviewed needed to be re-examined to ensure diligence. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Over 24 Million Approved</p>
<p>A Xinxin News Agency reporter learned from a member of the committee yesterday afternoon that since the establishment of the supervision committee, various types of collateral have been continuously sent by the various firms, with land deeds being the most numerous, followed by public bonds, and goods being extremely rare. As of this morning (i.e., yesterday afternoon), the amount approved by the supervision committee totaled over 24 million yuan. Once the Loan Committee expresses its approval of the collateral, the financial public bonds of the 24th year of the Republic will be allocated immediately for the money industry to collect and redeem for cash at the Loan Committee to facilitate circulation. The reporter also learned from highly reliable sources yesterday evening that the approved amount is expected to be fully allocated within days.</p>
<p>Centralized Collection and Transfer Convenient for Both Industries</p>
<p>After the banking and money industries implemented the establishment of depository stations and the centralized transfer of negotiable instruments, which were then summarized and sent directly to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking and Money Industries for clearing, both industries considered this method not only simple and easy to implement but also helpful in completely resolving the Shanghai clearing issue. At the same time, foreign banks also implemented the acceptance of this clearing method, making the circulation of funds in the market more active.</p>
<p>Financial Public Bonds Fully Redeemed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan of financial public bonds of the 24th year of the Republic and organized the Money Industry Supervision Committee to oversee the collateral. Regarding the collateral procedures, a Xinxin News Agency reporter learned from the Central Bank that after the money industry receives the financial public bonds of the 24th year of the Republic, they can be fully redeemed for cash at face value at the Loan Banking Syndicate.</p>
<p>Loan Banking Syndicate Starts Operations</p>
<p>After the Loan Banking Syndicate for rescuing the money industry was established at a meeting the day before yesterday, in order to facilitate the conduct of daily affairs, it specifically selected representatives from five institutions as standing committee members: the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking and Money Industries. The syndicate's office is temporarily located at the Central Bank and has already begun operations yesterday. The amount of the loan is 25 million yuan, with the money industry's collateral and the 25 million financial public bonds allocated by the Ministry of Finance as collateral. A Xinxin News Agency reporter recorded the exact amount of loans committed by each bank as follows: the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications collectively committed 18 million yuan, the Money Industry Reserve Depository 3 million yuan, the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the Kincheng Banking Corporation, the Yieh Commercial Bank, the Continental Bank, the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Chekiang Industrial Bank, and the Chekiang Commercial Bank each committed 500,000 yuan, totaling 3.5 million yuan, and the Bank of China National Products Bank and the Kuo Hua Commercial and Savings Bank each committed 250,000 yuan, totaling 500,000 yuan. The total amount above is 25 million yuan.</p>
<p>Committee for Custody of Certificates to Be Established Soon</p>
<p>A Xinxin News Agency reporter learned from financial circles yesterday that the difficulties encountered by the Shanghai money industry have been resolved through the Ministry of Finance's allocation of financial public bonds to collateralize cash flow and centralized clearing. With close cooperation between the banking and money industries, the financial market has become stable. To thoroughly aid industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance has specifically allocated 20 million yuan of national treasury certificates to be deposited with the Central Bank, instructing Cai Zengji and twelve others to receive and safeguard them. It is reported that Cai Zengji and the other twelve will convene a meeting within days to discuss the procedures for receiving and safeguarding the certificates.</p>
<p>Implementation of Loans to Aid Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>A Xinxin News Agency reporter learned from the banking and money industries yesterday that the money industry's crisis has been overcome, and the banking and money industries are determined to cooperate closely. Regarding loans to aid industry and commerce, they are now determined to provide as much as possible, as these loans are deeply related to maintaining industry and commerce and revitalizing the market. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 10 million yuan of national treasury certificates as a second guarantee for the loans, with the collateral of various industrial and commercial firms as the first guarantee. There is no question about the repayment of the loans. Therefore, both industries are willing to continue providing these loans secured by mortgages to aid industry and commerce. Various industrial and commercial firms have been submitting application forms one after another to the relevant national products organizations, so that they can be summarized and submitted to the Loan Committee for approval after its establishment.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Successfully Negotiates Hong Kong Passenger License - Hong Kong Government Recognizes Chinese Seafarers' Certificates - From Now On, Chinese Seafarers Will Receive Equal Treatment with Seafarers from Other Countries - An Unprecedented Achievement in China's Maritime Administration History</h3>
<p>The issuance of passenger licenses for ships in Hong Kong is extremely strict. A Hong Kong passenger license can only be obtained if the Hong Kong government considers the ship's hull to be excellent and the senior crew members are foreign. Last year, the newly built Sihai ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company applied for a passenger license, but the Hong Kong government required that all captains, first mates, second mates, and chief engineers of the four ships be foreign crew members before a license could be issued. Negotiations lasted for half a year without agreement. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in anger, abandoned Hong Kong passengers, preferring to suffer business losses rather than hire foreigners and damage national sovereignty and prestige. At the same time, it petitioned the central government to negotiate and strive for a resolution with the Hong Kong government. Yesterday, an order was received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the Hong Kong authorities had accepted China's request and recognized Chinese seafarers' certificates, and approved the issuance of passenger licenses. This is an unprecedented achievement in the history of China's shipping, worthy of special mention. From now on, Chinese ships going to Hong Kong, Chinese crew members will receive the same treatment as those from Europe and the United States. Therefore, preparations are underway to start selling Hong Kong passenger tickets from July 1st. The details of the matter are as follows:</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Government Initially Refused</p>
<p>Since the Haiyuan, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen ships of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were completed and put into service, only the Haiyuan ship was issued a passenger license by the Hong Kong Port Authority because it used foreign captains and crew members. The other three ships, Haiheng, Haili, and Haizhen, were not issued passenger licenses because they used Chinese captains and senior crew members. After repeated negotiations and efforts by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Hong Kong government stated that at a minimum, Chinese captains and crew members must pass the examination of the Hong Kong Marine Office. Only if they pass can passenger licenses be issued. The seafarers' certificates issued by the Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of China were not recognized. Therefore, the company held several meetings on this matter, preferring to give up Hong Kong passengers rather than compromise and use foreign crew members, which would damage China's rights. At the same time, it petitioned the central government, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the British government. Therefore, for the past six months, Haiheng, Haizhen, and Haili have not carried Hong Kong passengers, awaiting the results of the central government's negotiations.</p>
<p>Success Through Treaty Negotiations</p>
<p>The company received an order from the Ministry of Communications, stating that the loss of passenger revenue from the Hong Kong port alone was about 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per ship per year, which was inconsistent with the repayment of principal and interest of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Treaty. Therefore, it was necessary to ensure that all four Sihai ships could sell Hong Kong tickets. It then consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting it to strive for a resolution as soon as possible. In addition to instructing the Chinese ambassador to the UK to negotiate with the British government in London, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also telegraphed the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in Southwest China in Guangdong and Guangxi, requesting him to go to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Hong Kong government, citing that China had already joined the Nine-Nation Maritime Safety Convention, and was one of the key members of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, the seafarers' certificates issued by China were as valid as those of other countries, and the Hong Kong government had no reason to deny them. As a result of the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs in Southwest China's efforts to negotiate with the Hong Kong government, the Hong Kong government fully accepted China's demands and agreed to recognize them.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Government Accepts China's Position</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Special Envoy informing them of the negotiations with the Hong Kong government, stating that the Hong Kong government had fully accepted China's position. From July 1st of this year, the Hong Kong Port Authority would recognize the seafarers' certificates issued by the Ministry of Communications and the Maritime Affairs Bureau of China as having the same validity as those issued by the British government. From July 1st, seafarers holding certificates issued by the Chinese government (i.e., the Ministry of Communications and the Maritime Affairs Bureau) who serve as captains and senior crew members could receive the same treatment as seafarers from other countries, without any restrictions from the Hong Kong government. Furthermore, Chinese shipowners' ships could carry passengers without any restrictions. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was notified to take note of this.</p>
<p>Selling Hong Kong Tickets from July</p>
<p>After receiving this order, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company considered that the Hong Kong passenger license issue had been resolved satisfactorily, and that Chinese seafarers' certificates had achieved a status equal to those of other countries in the world. This was an unprecedented success in China's maritime administration history, which would greatly benefit the future of China's shipping industry. It hoped that Chinese seafarers would take their responsibilities seriously from now on and maintain this reputation and status. At the same time, the Hong Kong passenger tickets for the Haizhen, Haili, and Haiheng ships would be sold from July 1st. It would apply for passenger licenses from the Hong Kong government and prepare for the sale of Hong Kong tickets for the three ships at the company's ticket sales department.</p>
<h3>Central Mint - Review Committee Held Regular Meeting Yesterday - Total of 7.03 Million Yuan in Newly Minted Coins Last Month</h3>

The committee members present were Kong Xiangxi, Ma Xier, Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Zhesheng, Chen Jian'an, Chen Guangfu, Hao Shumin, Xi Demao, Xu Xinliu, Li Fusun, Bei Songsun, Sato, Xu Jilun, Song Ziliang, Spears, Studing, Sterder, Shi Huang, Wu Yunzhai, Hu Mengjia, Yabuki Takashi, Ye Zhuotang, Ye Fuxiao, Song Hanzhang, and Cockber.

Secretary Qiao Fusan reported that the total value of legally minted new coins reviewed in May was 7.03 million yuan, which had been approved for release from the factory and listed in a public announcement, and reported to the Ministry of Finance for record. The factory's operations, the factory's accounts, and the committee's work in May were also reported in detail. Subsequently, the chemist reported that the fineness and weight of the new coins released from the factory in May were all within the statutory tolerances. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Exchange Tax to be Levied - Gold Brokers Petitioned Yesterday - Director Xu Jianping of the Ministry of Finance Met with Them and Promised to Forward the Petition - Brokers Association to Convene a General Meeting in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced that the exchange tax would be levied from July 1st, gold exchange brokers, considering the tax rate too high and unbearable, petitioned the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning. Director Xu agreed to discuss it at length. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Petition - The exchange tax currently set by the Ministry of Finance is scheduled to take effect on July 1st. The tax collection method places a heavy emphasis on the bid deposit tax, which is almost twenty times higher than the tax rates for miscellaneous grains, flour, securities, and cloth. Because the calculation standard for other transaction taxes is one-tenth of the commission, and the commission for each bid deposit is one and a half per mille, the tax levied reaches six per mille, which is almost twice the commission. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, the Gold Brokers Association sent representatives Zhan Liansheng, Wang Jiafu, Gao Qiumei, Wang Yingchang, Yu Yuhong, Dong Zaisheng, Weng Nianqu, and others, a total of sixteen people, to the private residence of Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi on West Egham Road to petition. As the Minister of Finance was out on official business, they returned to the Central Bank, where Director Xu Jianping of the Ministry of Finance met with them. The representatives requested a reduction in the tax and a postponement of its collection. Director Xu replied that he would forward the petition to the Minister of Finance for review and decision.</p>
<p>Convening a Meeting - The Exchange Brokers Association believes that the date set by the Ministry of Finance for the tax collection is approaching, and it is difficult to predict whether the authorities will accept it. However, for the sake of their own interests, the brokers themselves have decided to convene a general meeting of all brokers in the coming days to report on the petition and the future direction. If necessary, they will send representatives to Beijing to petition the central government, hoping to achieve the goal of reducing and postponing the tax.</p>
<h3>Various Muslim Organizations Celebrated the Birthday of Muhammad Yesterday</h3>

After the celebration ceremony, a meal was served. The Islamic Normal School and the Humanitarian Monthly Magazine also held a party, inviting Wang Jingzhai, a famous Muslim scholar from Beiping, to give a lecture.</p>
<h3>Aviation Carnival Postponed</h3>
<p>The Flying Model Exhibition organized by the China Aviation Association is in active preparation, soliciting models, photographs, films, and publications from all parties. Various photographs, publications, and other materials are being sent in one after another. It is reported that the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Department sent in aircraft models yesterday, including the Bing-type airship, the Ding-type Sea Hawk seaplane, the Wu-type River Egret seaplane, the Ji-type River Swan seaplane, the Geng-type River Crane seaplane, the Geng-type River Phoenix seaplane, and the Xin-type Ninghai No. 2 seaplane, along with explanatory nameplates and enlarged photographs of various aircraft ribs and wing spars, totaling sixteen items.</p>
<p>The Aviation Sports Carnival, originally scheduled to be held at the Paramount Ballroom Hotel from 9:00 PM on the 26th of this month, as previously reported, has been postponed due to the complexity of the various entertainment items and insufficient preparation. The date of the postponement will be reported again after it is determined.</p>
<p>The office of the Chief Captain received yesterday from Captain Li Zhaohuan of Team 395 payment of membership fees and donations totaling 610.72 yuan, from Captain Xu Jianzhang of Team 299 a donation of 50 yuan, from Captain Yao Mulian of Team 42 payment of membership fees totaling 611.50 yuan, from Captain Chen Xiangtao of Team 409 payment of membership fees totaling 176 yuan, and from Deputy Captain Pan Boying of Team 245 payment of membership fees totaling 50 yuan.

<h3>Liu Chaojin Shooting Case - The Criminal's Plot to Harm Someone Was True - Chen Keyun Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Liu Chaojin, a foreman at the North Railway Station, was shot at twice in his residence at No. 13 Ningkang Lane, North Zhejiang Road, last month. After the General Patrol Room detectives apprehended the criminal Chen Keyun, Chen confessed that he was instigated by Liu's colleagues Li Ganrong and Cui Shitai. The patrol room also arrested and interrogated Li and Cui. The presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Special First Court discovered that Chen's confession contained many untruths. Li and Cui's lawyers, Fan Gang and Jiang Yiping, claimed that Li and Cui had filed a lawsuit in court against Liu Chaojin for embezzling public funds from the cooperative, and the prosecutor had already filed a prosecution. Therefore, Liu intentionally devised this plan to trap Li and Cui. To clarify the facts, Judge Qian went to Liu's house to conduct an on-site investigation and discovered that the bullet marks were fired downwards. Therefore, during the trial yesterday morning, he repeatedly questioned Chen, who claimed that the situation was true. Subsequently, the patrol room lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, believed that this case involved framing others and intentionally devising a false plan, and requested that the court render a judgment according to the law. After lawyers Jiang and Fan defended the defendants, Judge Qian sentenced Chen to three years and six months in prison and acquitted Li and Cui.</p>

<p>Hu Changzhi, the secretary-general of the conference, yesterday published the significance of this health campaign, saying that the forces of various organizations and agencies in this city, as well as the people, are gathered, and the 14th Health Campaign begins today. The health campaign is a form or publicity. From this publicity, a great force is generated, producing practical health work. This health campaign, in addition to promoting public health and establishing a nation, also contains two major meanings: (1) The advancement of modern material civilization has led the health undertakings of developed countries in Europe and the United States to the most sound path. Taking the medical and pharmaceutical industry in the United States as an example, there are 140,000 formal physicians, more than 400,000 nurses, 130,000 pharmacists, and 900,000 hospital beds. Experts serving in the medical and pharmaceutical field number more than one million. However, looking back at our country, there are only 5,000 physicians in the country, and hospitals and medical experts are even fewer. In contrast, the backwardness of China's health undertakings is a clear fact. The advancement or backwardness of health undertakings fully demonstrates the level of social culture. Therefore, the highest meaning of this health campaign is to improve China's cultural level. (2) In this 20th century of scientific prosperity, medicine and hygiene have progressed from the feudal period to the scientific period. However, in our country, medicine, divination, astrology, and physiognomy still occupy a great force in the medical field. These feudal remnants still firmly grasp the beliefs of the general public. However, from this health campaign onwards, we must establish new beliefs for the public, new scientific beliefs.</p>
<h3>Qimei Road Public Housing - The Municipal Government to Invite Bids Today - The Facilities Will be Extremely Complete and Thoughtful</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city, in view of the fact that the population of Shanghai exceeds three million, and the housing problem of the general public is very important, with a great impact on public security and health, in order to seek the welfare of the common people, has previously considered building public housing. Now, in order to realize this as soon as possible, the Public Welfare Undertakings Committee, after several discussions, has completely approved the Qimei Road public housing project and decided to build it first. The projects in Tanziwan and other places will be postponed for the time being. The municipal government has announced today that it will invite bids for the construction of the Qimei Road housing project. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Municipal Government Announcement</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Works announced yesterday that it is necessary to invite bids for the construction of the Qimei Road Public Village housing project. Any construction factory or construction company that has registered with the Bureau in accordance with the city's Construction Factory Registration Regulations and has rich experience can go to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works in the city center to pay the drawing fee of ten yuan and the bid deposit of one thousand yuan to obtain drawings and bid forms from June 15th to 22nd. Bids will be opened in public at the Bureau at 10:00 AM on June 29th. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Construction Plan</p>
<p>The construction drawings have been completely approved after being revised by the Architectural Design Group of the Welfare Committee some time ago. The Qimei Road housing construction plan will follow the drawings in all respects. In the middle is the public house, which has a public medicine school, a male toilet, and a female toilet. Each toilet has male and female bathrooms, all of which are showers. There are a total of eighteen male shower areas, which can accommodate forty people to bathe. There are nine female shower rooms, which are separated. In addition, there are consumer cooperatives and treatment facilities. In front of the public house is a playground. On the left and right sides are Class A, B, and C civilian residences. There are a total of two hundred and ten Class A residences, each with several rooms, including a living room, a loft, a toilet, and a kitchen. There are thirty-six Class B residences, each with three rooms, including a living room, a toilet, and a kitchen, but no loft. Therefore, Class A residences are better than Class B residences. Next to Class A, B, and C residences are public toilets and laundry rooms. The entire construction plan is not only a large-scale project with good ventilation, but also has extremely thoughtful facilities. Therefore, after completion, the benefits for the common people will be significant. According to the reporter of Shen Shi She, the official start date for the construction is definitely July 1st. Therefore, the Qimei Road public housing project will be completed in the shortest possible time. The public housing projects in Tanziwan and other places will be started as soon as preparations are completed.</p>
<h3>Wei Weiqing - Dispute with Maid - Reconciliation Failed Yesterday - A Major Conflict Arose Between the Two Sides</h3>
<p>Wei Weiqing, styled Ji Xi, aged fifty-two, residing at No. 57 Xintianxiang Lane, Belle Road, French Concession, served as the head of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Local Court when Zheng Yuxiu was the President of the Shanghai Local Court, and once acted as the President of the Court. After resigning, he served as a professor of law and politics at various universities in Shanghai. In July of last year, he joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member and practiced law in Shanghai, setting up an office on the third floor of the China and Foreign Bank on Nanjing Road. His son, Wei Yuwei, previously served as the director of the Accounting Section of the Special Second Court and is now the accounting director of the High Third Branch Court. Nine years ago, Wei spent money to buy a twelve-year-old girl from his hometown, named Wu, as an adopted daughter, renaming her Wei Guizhen, but in reality, he made her do housework. Although Wei was over forty years old at the time, his sexual desire was still strong. The following year, he saw that the girl had a beautiful appearance and had developed, so he used despicable means to rape</p>
<h3>Accident of the Zhengchang Hejing Steamer: Five Bodies Recovered; Capsized by Waves at Yangsi Harbor; Shipowner and Newlywed Son Perish Together</h3>
<p>The Hejing steamer, belonging to the Zhengchang Steamer Company on Suzhou Road in this city, set sail from Shanghai for Huzhou at 12:00 noon on the 10th of this month. The steamer was towing six cargo ships of various kinds. At 2:00 p.m., while passing through Yangsi Harbor, it encountered a sudden thunderstorm, with fierce winds roaring, causing one of the towed cargo ships to capsize, throwing nine people into the water, of whom only four were rescued. This was briefly reported in the newspapers. Now, all five of those who fell into the water have not been saved, and their bodies have been recovered as of last night. The scene was extremely tragic. The following is an account of the entire incident:</p>
<p>Waves Capsize the Ship</p>
<p>The Hejing steamer, towing six cargo ships, set sail for Huzhou at noon on the 10th of this month. At around 2:00 p.m., while passing the Jiangmian (river surface) near the Yangsi Harbor Cement Factory, it encountered a sudden thunderstorm. With fierce winds and waves, the last cargo ship being towed by the steamer, heavily laden with planks and thus sitting low in the water, was capsized by the wind and waves, throwing both people and cargo into the water.</p>
<p>Nine People Fall into the Water</p>
<p>The cargo ship was usually used for transporting silk. The shipowner, Zhu Fuchang, was from Shengze. This time, he loaded silk in Shengze and arrived in Shanghai, delivering the silk to the Shengjing Public Office in the Shengjing Lane of South Suzhou Road. After unloading the silk, he loaded planks. Including the steamer crew and passengers, there were a total of nine people.</p>
<p>Four Survive</p>
<p>After the towing ship had an accident, the Hejing steamer immediately stopped to rescue. However, the thunderstorm was sudden and the waves were immense. Although the shipowner Zhu Fuchang and four others were rescued alive, two more people were later recovered, but had already drowned. One was a passenger named A Long, and the other was a crew member named A Tuo. The bodies of three more people could not be recovered for the time being.</p>
<p>Five Bodies Recovered</p>
<p>The Hejing Lun (steamer) then moored at the port overnight and departed for Huzhou the next morning. Zhu Fuchang's cargo ship remained at the site to continue recovering the bodies. It was not until the night before last that the three bodies were recovered one after another. One was the shipowner Zhu Fuchang's son, named A Da (24 years old), who had just gotten married last year. The other two were crew members, named Huang Du and A San.</p>
<p>Coffins Prepared for Burial</p>
<p>The Shengjing Public Office in this city had already arranged for three coffins to be sent to the site yesterday morning to prepare for the burial. At the same time, they requested the authorities to waive inspection. As for the two bodies recovered at the time, the local Baojia (neighborhood watch) chief Wang Bingsheng of the 24th Bao 3rd Tu had reported to the local court, which carried out an inspection and autopsy. The planks loaded on the ship had all been recovered, and the material losses were still minimal.</p>
<h3>American Company Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co. Sues Chen Huanzhi and His Son; A Detailed Account of Allegations of Embezzlement and Breach of Trust; Continued Hearing Held Yesterday, Adjourned for Further Trial</h3>
<p>Parr Mack, the general manager of the American company Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co., hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to criminally sue Chen Huanzhi, his son Wenxiang, and Cheng Jingchi, a staff member of the Taidong Wharf, for embezzlement and breach of trust. The First Special District Court instructed them to supplement the reasons for the continuing lawsuit. The acting lawyer Lin has now highlighted the main points to prove the defendants' criminal behavior: (1) Defendant Chen Wenxiang is the manager of Andersen, Meyer &amp; Co.'s Taidong Wharf, which is not in dispute. According to the duties of the wharf manager, limited to managing all work on the wharf, he cannot independently enter into contracts with outsiders that affect the overall situation. However, Chen Wenxiang privately appointed Chen Tiwu and Jin Youmei as wharf brokers and Li Haiqing as the head of the stevedores, which is a violation of his duties and disrespect for the company. His purpose was to collect guarantee deposits, totaling 20,000 yuan from Chen Tiwu, etc., and 5,000 yuan from Li Haiqing. This guarantee deposit was collected in the name of the Taidong Wharf and should have been deposited into the company account, but the defendant not only failed to deposit it into the bank as agreed (Article 4 of the contract dated June 4, 1934) but also kept it secret and pocketed it, using it for personal expenses. This is embezzlement of property held in the course of business. Also, the Taidong Wharf had ships docking and generating income since October 2, 1934. According to the contract, this income should also have been deposited into the bank. The defendant failed to report this income and embezzled it for personal gain, which is a crime of embezzlement in the course of business. (2) In March 1934, Chen Wenxiang introduced Gu Xinji Construction Factory to contract the construction project, with a contract price of 75,000 yuan. According to Article 2 of the contract, all construction costs would be paid in 18 monthly installments, starting 30 days after the entire project was completed, formally accepted by the owner, and approved by the customs authorities, or deemed qualified, with each installment being 4,166.66 yuan. The contract was clear and precise. However, the project has not yet been handed over or accepted, and Chen Wenxiang has already paid Gu Xinji the construction cost. According to his statement, he has paid up to 56,000 yuan, which is a violation of his duties under the above-mentioned contract and a violation of the criminal law's regulations on breach of trust. Moreover, Gu Xinji only received about 20,000 yuan, so the difference was also embezzled by him, which is even more obvious. This defendant is guilty of both breach of trust and embezzlement. Also, the defendant falsely established Yixingfu Company to contract the stevedoring work, with the price being 40% higher than normal, and pocketed the difference for personal gain, which is also breach of trust and embezzlement. (3) Defendant Cheng Jingchi was hired by the company and paid by the company. He should have obeyed the company's instructions and sought benefits for the company. All income should have been paid into the bank according to regulations. However, he only followed Chen Wenxiang's lead, disregarded the company's orders, and privately handed over all money to Chen Wenxiang. His collusion in fraud and his crimes of embezzlement and breach of trust cannot be excused by empty words. (4) Chen Huanzhi is Chen Wenxiang's father and runs Fu'an Hardware Store. All payments made by the company were entrusted to Chen Huanzhi by Chen Wenxiang for payment. However, Chen Huanzhi profited from this, keeping two sets of books or creating something out of nothing. One example that has been found is that the customs fees payable in 1934, up to the end of September, totaled three quarters, each quarter being 468 yuan, but Fu'an paid as many as four times. This is inflating the accounts to profit. Another example is the police expenses for the wharf in April 1934, totaling 168 yuan, which had already been paid by the bank. However, Fu'an also included this in its payment items. This is creating something out of nothing to seek illegal profits. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhaoqi continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The plaintiff's lawyer Lin detailed the process and presented various contract copies and bills for inspection. Defendant Chen Wenxiang did not appear because he had another civil case in the civil court. Chen Huanzhi did not understand the allegations very well. Cheng Jingchi claimed that he did not acknowledge bearing all matters concerning Taidong Wharf. The court adjourned the hearing for further review.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Park Construction in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>According to the May report from the Parks Management Office of the Public Works Department, many new facilities have been added to the parks recently, and the number of visitors is extremely high. The total number of visitors to the parks in May reached 397,173. The most significant event was the opening of Jiaozhou Park. The opening date of the park was May 12th, which was a Sunday.

<h3>Detailed Account of the Xinzha Police Station's Chinese and Foreign Detectives Solving a Kidnapping Case in Songjiang; Fifteen Male and Female Bandits Apprehended in Various Parts of the Chinese Concession; Rescue of the Hostage from Danger in a Xiaobang Boat in Yanduntuan</h3>
<p>Starting from the night of the 12th to the night before last, Chinese Detective Mao Yiwen, detectives Ma Zhongrong and Ruan Yao, and civilian detectives Xu Zhenzheng and Wang Qishan of the Xinzha Police Station, along with Western Detective Chief Wilcox, successively apprehended fifteen male and female kidnapping bandits in various parts of the Chinese Concession. They confiscated two pistols, thirty-two bullets, three cartridge clips, paper money totaling 185 yuan, forty-one copper coins, two checks with a face value of 480 yuan, and a cloth bag, and rescued Lu Fushan, a hostage from Songjiang. All were taken to the police station, and each was detained separately. The details have been briefly reported in the newspapers. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the bandits to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court to request approval for detention. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, described the incident, stating that Lu Fushan, a farmer from Yaojing Town, Songjiang, had accumulated some savings through farming, which led to</p>
<p>the covetousness of a gang of bandits. On the night of April 15th of this year, more than ten bandits armed with weapons broke into his house, kidnapped Lu Fushan, and hid him on a boat, sending a letter demanding a ransom of 15,000 yuan. Lu's family then sent relatives Chen Xuequan and Wang Jinyu to Shanghai, who negotiated with the bandits twice. The day before yesterday, they went to the Yong'an Inn at No. 37 Fujian Road to meet with the bandits to pay the ransom. The incident was discovered by Detective Xu Zhenzheng of the Xinzha Police Station, who then, together with the above-mentioned Chinese and foreign detectives, armed with weapons, went to the Yong'an Inn and apprehended the defendants Wang A'san and Hao Shicai on the spot. They were taken to the police station, where they confessed to kidnapping Lu Fushan and receiving</p>
<p>450 yuan, a small portion of the ransom, from the hostage's representatives on June 7th at the Huadong Inn on Shandong Road. They stated that the remaining ransom and the weapons used at the time had been given to Hao Shicai's father (i.e., the master), Chen Gaofu, as Chen was the mastermind of the case. His residence was at No. 8 Huishan Lane. The detectives then went to the address and apprehended Chen Gaofu and Sun Ziming, but no weapons were found during the search. They then questioned Chen about where the weapons were hidden. According to him, they were stored at the home of his uncle Chen A'jin in Yinxiang Port. Therefore, they went to A'jin's shack in Jiangjiabang, Yinxiang Port, and arrested A'jin, confiscating two pistols and bullets from the straw on the roof. They then went to another shack and</p>
<p>apprehended fellow gang members Zhang Ziwan and Zhang Zifu. At the same time, the detectives stationed at No. 8 Huishan Lane successively apprehended Li San, Chen Shaolin, and Shen Chenshi. However, Shen Chenshi discarded a cloth bag tied around her waist, which was recovered by the detectives. Inside, in addition to paper money totaling 185 yuan and copper coins, there was also a check for 80 yuan from the American Express Bank and a check for 400 yuan from the Jiaotong Bank of Taicang. Subsequently, the defendants confessed that the hostage was hidden on a boat between Minhang and Zhaura. The Chinese and foreign detectives then joined the detectives of the local Public Security Bureau and walked to Zhangjiagang</p>
<p>on a small boat on the river, where they apprehended Wu Si, Yang A'da, Wang Zhushi (a woman), Yang A'kui, and others. However, the hostage was not there. Wang Zhushi confessed that the hostage was hidden on a Xiaobang boat in Yanduntuan. They then walked another six or seven miles to the boat in Yanduntuan. They found the hostage Lu Fushan curled up in the cabin at the bow of the boat. They rescued him from danger and took him, along with Zhou Fuqing, who was guarding the hostage, to the Public Security Bureau, which then transferred them to the police station. The male and female bandits apprehended in this case, totaling fifteen people, are all from Jiangbei. The police station suspected that they may have committed other crimes within the concession and requested detention for investigation. The items confiscated were presented to the court. Subsequently, the hostage Lu Fushan testified that he was 56 years old and from Songjiang.</p>
<p>He was a farmer. On the night of April 15th of this year, more than ten kidnappers armed with weapons broke in and took him onto a small boat, where he was confined to a small cabin at the bow of the boat. It has been almost two months until yesterday, when he was rescued by the detectives. He identified Wang A'san, Hao Shicai, and Chen Gaofu as the ones who physically carried out the kidnapping, and Wang Zhushi and Zhou Fuqing as the ones who were guarding him. Subsequently, witnesses Chen Xuequan and Wang Jinyu filed a report, proving that the ransom of 450 yuan was given to Wang and Hao. After Judge Yang Zhaoqi briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered Wang A'san and the other fourteen to be detained for seven days for further questioning. If anyone is found to be not suspicious, they will be released at any time.</p>
<h3>Appointment Procedures for Chinese Representatives in the Telephone Committee</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department has recently decided on the organization of the special telephone committee. The committee will consist of approximately four to five members, including one representative from China, Japan, Britain, and the United States, as well as one representative selected from residents of smaller countries. According to the proposal of Dr. Kan Seimatsu, a Japanese taxpayer, at the Taxpayers' Annual Meeting on April 17th, the members of the committee must be appointed by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department in consultation with the representative groups of each resident, and not appointed independently by the Public Works Department. Therefore, the name of the Chinese representative must be recommended by the Chinese resident representative group before being submitted to the Public Works Department for appointment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai North National Products Exhibition Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>Shenshang (gentry merchants) Cai Qiaojun and others in Zhabei have initiated the Shanghai North National Products Exhibition and Sale Fair to revive the prosperity of Zhabei, with the consent of Wang Binyan. The vacant land of the Charity Association on Datong Road has been designated as the venue, and the China National Products Manufacturers Association has been invited to cooperate. Datong Road in Zhabei is the most prosperous commercial area, with many pedestrians. Especially during this early summer, the silk factories are now resuming work. Holding a national products exhibition and sale fair during this period will surely have good results. The fair is scheduled to open on the 25th of this month, and registration has begun immediately. It is reported that many manufacturers went to register at No. 4 Yongji Lane, Xizang Road, yesterday.</p>
<h3>Recruitment by the Shanghai South Security Corps; New Members to Begin Registration Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>National Products Factories Throughout the City; Preferential Treatment for Students with National Products Annual Membership Cards; Special Benefits for Purchasing Goods with Membership Cards</h3>
<p>Since the Student National Products Annual Promotion Association in this city began soliciting members, it has received enthusiastic support from the team leaders and achieved excellent results. It is said that the solicitation method is to start with the schools. All students in large, medium, and small schools in this city are automatically members without paying membership fees. Each student has the obligation to introduce members, with university students introducing at least three members, middle school students introducing two, and elementary school students introducing one. The membership fee is only 20 cents per person, which is very easy. More members joining means more citizens determined to use national products, which is like adding a new force to the national products industry. Therefore, all students are willing to enthusiastically introduce relatives to join the association to increase its strength. It is also reported that the national products factories in this city have expressed unusual sympathy for the association's membership drive and the students' enthusiastic introduction and have voluntarily formulated preferential measures. Those who present the association's membership card when purchasing goods will enjoy special preferential benefits. It is said that many factories have already participated, and a large number of manufacturers are also formulating measures, which will be announced continuously once decided. The preferential measures of the participating national products factories are as follows: The Commercial Press offers a 5% discount, the Huafu Jinhua Factory offers a 10% discount, the China Educational Toy Factory offers a 5% discount in addition to the wholesale price, the Samsung Cotton and Iron Factory offers a 10% discount, the China National Products Company offers a 10% discount, the China Underwear Company offers a 10% discount, the Jinglun Shirt and Sock Factory offers the wholesale price, the Tianyiwei Mother Factory offers an 80% discount, the Rongfeng Embroidery Thread Factory offers the wholesale price (flower patterns are given away with the sale), the China-France Pharmacy offers a discount on the original price, the Meiya Silk Factory offers a 10% discount, the First Brand Toothbrush Factory offers the wholesale price, the Datong Bookstore offers an 80% discount, the Tianran Ink Factory offers a 10% discount, the Jincheng Arts and Crafts Society offers a 5% discount, the China Enamel Factory offers a 10% discount, the Huawen Pencil Factory offers the wholesale price, and the Huaou Sugar Factory offers an 80% discount.

<h3>Public Works Department Publishes English Translation of the New Chinese Criminal Code</h3>
<p>Mr. R. T. Bryan, Jr., head of the legal department of the Public Works Department, recently authored a book on Chinese criminal law, originally titled "The Chinese Criminal Code and Special and Administrative Laws." The contents include the New Criminal Code of the Republic of China promulgated on January 1, 1935, the Implementation Law of the New Criminal Code promulgated on April 1, and other special criminal laws, such as the Emergency Regulations for Punishing Those Who Endanger the Republic of China, Measures for Implementing the Prohibition of Opium, Regulations on Restricting Military Weapons, Suppressing Private Salt, and Violations of Police Regulations, etc. It is quite perfect. The old Criminal Code of the Republic of China was previously translated into English by British Consul Bardet and Liang Long, but only the Criminal Code was translated. The book compiled by Mr. Bryan is the only good version that combines the translation of the New Chinese Criminal Code with other special criminal law regulations and rules.</p>
<h3>Fire at Chen Hanming's Home</h3>
<p>The three-story Western-style house at No. 166 East Sports Association Road, North Sichuan Road, is the residence of Chen Hanming, a reporter for the local North China Daily News. Yesterday at around 5:45 p.m., when the three-story building was empty, a short circuit suddenly occurred, and flames immediately shot out, piercing the roof. After Chen's family saw this, they frantically blew the alarm whistle and summoned the Zhabei fire brigades to rush to the scene with their leather hose carts. The fire was extinguished until 7:00 p.m. As a result, only a large room on the third floor was burned, and the loss was minimal. When the reporter arrived at the scene, he saw Chen barefoot, helping to put out the fire. The women and children of the family were huddled in a corner of the garden, having already suffered a scare. It is reported that he has fire insurance of several thousand taels.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Homes for Vagrant Workers, Funded by Hu Wenhu</h3>
<p>The Caohongjing Home for Vagrant Workers has been established for a long time and has achieved remarkable results in reforming criminals. Due to financial limitations, it has been unable to expand. Overseas Chinese magnate Hu Wenhu, owner of Tiger Balm Yong'an Hall, is enthusiastic about charitable and public welfare undertakings. He returned to China last year and visited the home, expressing much appreciation. He agreed to build eighty houses that year to help with expansion. It is now learned that the home has obtained a building permit from the Public Works Bureau and is currently advertising for contractors to bid. Bids are due on the 20th of this month, with a deadline for construction. Upon completion, the home will be able to expand its enrollment quota, benefiting vagrants and society, which is no small matter.</p>
<h3>Legislator Peng Yangguang Arrives in Shanghai; Solicits Opinions on Ritual and Dress Codes; Hosted a Lecture on Ritual Education the Day Before Yesterday; Peng to Return to Beijing on the Night Express Today</h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Legislator Peng Yangguang, also chairman of the Legislative Review Committee, was previously ordered by President Sun of the Legislative Yuan to go to the north and south to investigate ritual and dress codes so that the Legislative Yuan would have something to refer to when drafting ritual and dress codes. After receiving the order, Peng has gone through Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi to carry out the investigation work, which has been very arduous. It is now learned that Peng came to Shanghai on the morning of the 13th because the compilation of ritual and dress codes was originally requested by the chambers of commerce in Beiping and Shanghai to the Legislative Yuan. He immediately drove to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to collect opinions on the legal system. He was received by Zhu Boyuan, the chief secretary of the association, who replied that he would discuss the points inquired by Peng at the association's committee meeting. After collecting opinions from all parties, he would submit the written opinions directly to the Legislative Yuan. After Peng left the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, he went to the Moral Association at the invitation of the association to give a lecture on ritual education. At 6:00 p.m., he hosted a reception for leaders of Shanghai groups at the Cilin on Edward Road, including Wu Xingya, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Zhiben, Huang Jinrong, and dozens of others. During the meeting, Peng again lectured on ritual issues, which lasted for over an hour. Peng, having completed his work in Shanghai, is scheduled to take the night express train to Beijing today to report back.</p>
<h3>Fake Clinic Scam: Two Youths Arrested for Fraud, Donation Books and Receipts Confiscated for Legal Action</h3>
<p>Two youths from Fujian, Feng Xiusheng and Chen Jinqing, were without occupation and had no fixed address in Shanghai, engaging in scams daily for a living. Recently, Feng and Chen wandered into Shanghai, unable to make ends meet, and conceived a bizarre idea. They printed "Fujian Public Charity Clinic" donation books and receipts, and went to various places in the city. They falsely claimed to ignorant men and women that due to the summer heat and prevalence of epidemics, they were establishing a hospital to provide free medical treatment to the poor and sick. Their plan was to raise funds for personal gain and lavish spending. However, yesterday morning, they went to Yangshupu and were asking Ningbo natives Wang Donglin and Sha Songlan on two sand ships for donations in the name of establishing a clinic with insufficient funding. They were spotted by officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Brigade. Upon interrogation, Feng and Chen stammered and were taken to the team along with the witnesses. During interrogation, the two confessed to defrauding due to their inability to make a living. After verification, the brigade, considering the case as fraud and obtaining property, ordered Feng Xiusheng and Chen Jinqing, along with the evidence, to be transferred to the bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>Seventy-Four-Year-Old Virgin's Treatment Causes Dispute</h3>
<p>Lu Lüshi, a tenant living downstairs at No. 1240 Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, at the Pan Yutai tobacco and sundries store (57 years old, from Jiangyin), whose husband has passed away, has two sons. The elder son, Jinfa, is 29 years old, and the younger son, Jinhong, is 26 years old and a coppersmith. Recently, Jinhong suddenly suffered from a tooth ailment. Wu Wangshi, who lives at No. 1 Renchang Lane next door to Lu, knew Lü and introduced her to a 74-year-old virgin living in a small alley next door to the Yongxing Road Xibaoweituan [West Defense Group]. (The old virgin is said to be a virgin girl, hence the famous old girl, who has a Buddhist altar and specializes in treating people for a living.) The agreed medical fee was 16 yuan, and it was guaranteed that she could eat within two days. She did not charge much at the time, only collecting two small yuan for the pulse fee and six small yuan for the pill and potion fee. Eight yuan was to be paid first after three days. Unexpectedly, Jinhong vomited fresh blood and bled non-stop from the lower part of his body after taking the pills and potions from about 3 pm the day before yesterday until yesterday morning. Seeing this, Lü rushed to the old virgin's place to negotiate. The old virgin initially said she could stop it and hurriedly took back the pills and potions, but later she had no solution and became indignant and obstinate. Lü had no choice but to report to Officer Jia Hongkui at No. 34, who took the old virgin to the Zhongxing Road Police Station. After a brief interrogation by Inspector Xie Zhongyi, he sent the plaintiff, Lu Lüshi, and the defendant, He, (the old virgin) to the Xinzha Branch. After questioning Lu about the previous situation, the branch officer Huang Chongren found He evasive. After taking the confession, Officer Huang, considering the case as a murder by a quack doctor, immediately reported to Branch Chief Ruan Kaiji, who sent Inspector Li Changgeng and policeman Jiang Shulin to investigate with Lu Lüshi. They found Lü's son, Jinhong, still vomiting blood and with a large amount of blood in his stool, lying in a pool of blood, in a life-threatening condition. They reported the situation to Branch Chief Ruan for review. Ruan ordered Huang to continue the interrogation and then ordered them to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory: Factory Building Cost Dispute Concluded, Judgment Set for the 19th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, jointly established by Yu Zhendong, Zhang Rongchu, and others, is a limited company. Yu serves as chairman and Zhang as general manager. The scale is quite large, and the business is extensive. Last year, the construction of the company's factory building on Huade Road was contracted to construction foreman Wang Liansheng. After completion, a balance of 15,750 yuan was still owed for the construction cost. The company first issued two checks from Dadezhuang dated February 20 for 5,500 yuan. However, when Wang presented the checks to Dade for payment at maturity, the deposit was insufficient, and the checks were rejected. The remaining 7,250 yuan was also repeatedly ignored. Wang, therefore, hired lawyer Yu Lin to file a lawsuit against Yu Zhendong, the chairman, and Zhang Rongchu, the general manager, of the company, requesting a judgment ordering repayment of the full amount owed and interest. To secure the debt, he requested a preliminary attachment of the newly built factory building. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang of the First Special District Court held a hearing. The defendants were absent, and lawyer E Sen appeared on their behalf, admitting the debt. He requested permission to repay it in installments, with one installment every two months, to be fully repaid within one and a half years. He stated that this installment method was not only for the plaintiff's debt but also for other debts. The defendant did not suffer business failure but had excessive inventory, and even if discounted, there was no way out. The plaintiff's lawyer objected to the long period, stating that the building materials needed by the plaintiff were also purchased on credit and would be used to repay others with what was obtained from the defendant. Such a long period was difficult to wait for. Since the defendant had over a million yuan in inventory, how could they not find a way to repay a debt of over ten thousand yuan? Judge Zhang then ordered both parties to withdraw and wait for the verdict at noon on the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Nanny Run Over and Killed by Train on Songhu Railway; Employed in Song only Two Months</h3>
<p>Cai Yongxuan, a coppersmith at the Zhanghuabang Songhu Railway Main Factory, lived with his family in the Xujiazhai house opposite the factory. They employed a nanny, Shi Du, 36 years old, from Chongming. At around 9 am the day before yesterday, Shi went to the riverbank by the railway at the factory gate to wash rice. When returning home after washing the rice, while crossing the railway, the Songhu passenger train returning to Shanghai arrived. Shi was unable to avoid it and was knocked down by the train's front. Her head was crushed, her brains splattered, and she died instantly. Later, Zhao Xiaomao, the local bailiff of the 28th Tu, went to Shanghai to report to the court. Yesterday morning at 9 am, the court sent personnel to the scene. The inspection confirmed that Shi Du died from being run over. After the inspection, while the employer was arranging for clothing and a coffin, the deceased's husband, Shi Yinlang, and others arrived from Chongming, saw the body, and wept bitterly. They claimed that Shi had two sons, the elder seven years old and the younger only four years old. The family was extremely poor, and she had only been employed in Song for two months. They cried incessantly, moving those who heard it to tears.</p>
<h3>Dagu Road: Red Pill Workshop to be Investigated Further</h3>
<p>Fan Defu, a Chinese detective chief, and Zhang Faxiang, a detective, of the Hongkou Police Station, cracked down on a secret workshop for manufacturing the highly addictive drug red pills at No. 1256 Dagu Road at 10:40 pm the night before last. They arrested six suspects from Haimen, Lu Guangzu, Tao Jinwen, Qian Shuiming, Qian Qinglang; Tao Zi'an from Anhui; Zhao Xishi, a woman from Changzhou; and seized four small cans of morphine, one large bag of heroin, along with red pills and paraphernalia. They were taken to the police station, detained separately, and transferred to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department recounted the previous situation and requested an extension for detailed investigation. Following this, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the investigation process, stating that when arresting the suspects, they saw Tao Jinwen and Zhao Xishi eating red pills. They presented all the evidence for inspection and questioned the defendants, whose statements were evasive. The court ordered them to be returned to custody for further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Yuyuan Road Drug Manufacturing Workshop Case: Transferred to the Local Court, Highly Organized and Well-Equipped</h3>
<p>You A'gen, Chinese chief detective, and Pang Ruiqing, detective, of the Laozha Police Station, learned that No. 1238 Yuyuan Road was a large-scale drug manufacturing workshop and began investigating. They found the organization inside the house to be extremely tight. There was a guardhouse at the entrance. Passing through the guardhouse was a spacious garden, with front and back Western-style houses and a sky bridge connecting them. The drug manufacturing workshop was inside the last Western-style house. There was an alarm bell in the room, which would be rung to notify the drug den workers to hide in case of an emergency. The owner of the house was identified as Akino Tsukibo, a Korean (Chinese name Li Taiyuan). Detective You, at around 5 pm the day before yesterday, along with detectives Liu Junqing, Zhang Yuanjing, Xie Shuiquan, Jiang Linxiang, Wang Yingjie, He Renrui, and others, secretly went to the address with the Japanese consulate police. They scaled the wall and entered. First, several detectives rushed to the guardhouse and arrested Wang Ziwen from Jiangbei and Zhuang Ai'quan from Shanghai to prevent them from pressing the alarm bell. They then rushed through the garden and directly into the room of Akino Tsukibo in the front Western-style house and arrested Akino. In the passageway, they arrested Li Rufa from Ningbo, Akino's partner, and worker Bao A'yi. In a room behind Akino's residence, they discovered that Qiu Meifeng was stoking a fire in a drying room and arrested him as well. Then, in the rear Western-style house, they seized over ninety items used for manufacturing drugs, including vats, cans, pots, glass bottles, drying ovens, wooden sieves, alcohol, ammonia, spirit, chemicals, measuring instruments, opium, generators, and drug manufacturing machines. Since they were all heavy items, it was inconvenient to transport them, so they sent detectives to guard them. Meanwhile, the arrested suspects, excluding Akino Tsukibo, who was sent to the Japanese Consulate for investigation, were transferred to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Qian Hongye, the criminal court judge, took the bench for questioning. Ru Baoyi, the police lawyer, stated the case and prosecuted them under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. He also mentioned that the location of the case was on Yuyuan Road, which the court considered a road built beyond the boundaries, so the issue of jurisdiction should be decided by the court. Following this, Krauff, the Western detective chief, explained the details of the search. Zhu Rufa confessed that he was friends with Akino. Although he agreed to join the drug business for 700 yuan, he did not pay because he could not raise the funds. Most of the equipment, etc., was handled by him. Bao A'yi confessed that he was only responsible for cleaning, with a monthly salary of 20 yuan. Qiu Meifeng confessed that he was hired as a fireman and was arrested four hours after entering. Wang Ziwen confessed that he was a cook with a monthly salary of 10 yuan. Zhuang Ai'quan confessed that he was a driver (permit No. 8172 has been detained by the police station) and also performed internal work. Judge Qian, after verifying the confessions, transferred the five defendants and the evidence to the Shanghai Local Court due to jurisdictional errors.</p>

<h3>Movement to Transfer Governance of Shengsi Islands</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Association, the Dinghai Shanghai Association, and the Fenghua Shanghai Association have repeatedly received letters from representatives of residents of the Shengsi Islands, requesting that the islands be placed under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County, Zhejiang. The associations, considering this a major issue, convened a joint meeting of relevant organizations on the 2nd of this month. Representatives present included Chu Huiseng, Yin Tiefu, and Cha Zhongjian from the All Zhejiang Association; Huang Ziyu and Yin Shuxiang from the Wenzhou Association; Li Weixiong from the Hezhou Association; Chen Yiting and Zhao Changwei from the Dinghai Association; Zhang Xiaoming from the Dinghai Fisheries Association; Shu Jufang from the Ningbo Fisheries Association; and others. A unanimous resolution was made to petition Chairman Chiang, the Ministry of Interior, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to re-examine and transfer the islands to Zhejiang's governance. The original petition is excerpted below: "Petition for the Shengsi Islands, originally under Zhejiang jurisdiction, with environmental facts indicating a shared need, requesting a return to Zhejiang governance to align with popular sentiment. According to fellow villagers residing on Shengshan and Sijiao Islands, they have resided on the islands for many years, most engaging in fishing, with some also engaged in commerce. As the islands are located within Zhejiang Province, separated only by water from Huanglong, a subordinate of Dinghai County, the island's residents have migrated from the three prefectures of Ning, Tai, and Wen in Zhejiang, with those from Ning accounting for the majority, nearly two-thirds of the total. All financial transactions, navigation, and other activities have close ties with Ningbo. Even mail is sent via Dinghai instead of Chongming. In the past, security on the islands was the responsibility of the Zhejiang Water Police. However, since jurisdiction belongs to Chongming, Jiangsu, the distance is vast, communication is hampered, and they often suffer from the oppression of petty officials. Lower-level information cannot reach the higher levels, causing the islanders to suffer grievances, lose peace of mind, and hinder the development of various industries. Therefore, based on the consensus of the fellow villagers, we propose that your association forward a petition to the government, requesting that the islands be placed under the jurisdiction of Dinghai County in Zhejiang, so that the suffering of the islanders can be reported at any time. This is what all the fellow villagers on the island hope for. According to research, the Shengsi Islands, also known as the Saddle Islands in the West, lie between 30 and 31 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees east longitude. To the west are the Baker Islands and the Luanxing Islands, about 100 kilometers from the Qiantang River's estuary. According to geological surveys, the islands and the Zhoushan Islands are both part of the Xiangshan Mountain range. Also, the Qiantang River's Shanjian Mountain Mouth flows northward directly towards Nanhui Mouth, turning southeast. The islands are within the reach of the tide. From a geographical perspective, they should naturally belong to Zhejiang - point one. The islands are over 110 nautical miles from Chongming County and only 100 nautical miles from Dinghai. The islands are actually closer to Dinghai, and part of the area is separated from Huanglong, a subordinate of Dinghai, by only water. If Chongming officials want to go to Shengshan, they must detour through Shanghai and Dinghai, taking four days to reach their destination. Dinghai, however, has three steamships traveling to and from the islands, departing in the morning and arriving in the evening, which is convenient for the islanders. Moreover, there is no direct postal connection between Chongming and the islands. The postal area is under Ningbo, so all mail must be relayed through Ningbo. Based on the current state of transportation, the islands should be placed under Zhejiang's jurisdiction - point two. The islands are currently an important fishing area, and all fishermen belong to Zhejiang. All financial transactions between fishermen and merchants are handled by Dinghai and Ningbo banks. Some use cash, while others use drafts. There is absolutely no financial relationship with Chongming. Based on the overall fishing economy, the islands should be placed under Zhejiang's jurisdiction - point three. According to the Zhejiang Gazetteer, during the Southern Song Dynasty, twelve water stations were established between Zhaobao Mountain (now Zhenhai) and Bixia Mountain on Luohua Mountain, with fortifications and defenses to prevent coastal invaders. The current Shengsi Islands were originally under Zhejiang's governance during the Song Dynasty, without a doubt. Also, according to the Dinghai Gazetteer, during the Yuan Dynasty, the islands belonged to Penglai Township under Changguo Prefecture. By the mid-Ming Dynasty, when Japanese pirates ravaged the coast, Governor Hu Zongxian divided the coastal islands of eastern Zhejiang into three garrisons: upper, middle, and lower. The lower garrison included Shengshan, Maji, and other islands, patrolled by the Dinghai Shenjiamen naval forces. Alarms were signaled by arm gestures and beacon fires. Thus, the islands were a shield for Zhejiang, as close as lips and teeth. Since the late Qing Dynasty, the islands have often been a haven for pirates, with joint patrols by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang navies. With the establishment of the Republic of China, the joint patrol system was interrupted, and Zhejiang was solely responsible for protection, with Jiangsu not involved. All of the above facts can be verified in historical records. Based on the history of coastal defense, the islands should be placed under Zhejiang's jurisdiction - point four. In summary, all residents of the islands are from Zhejiang, and their customs and habits are the same as those of Zhejiang. Relatives and friends are all in Zhejiang. Their connection with Chongming, Jiangsu, is merely nominal. Chongming's view of the islands is like Qin Yue's view of the fertile or barren land, with no connection to their pain or illness. The fellow villagers' request to be placed under Zhejiang's jurisdiction is crucial. After repeated meetings, the associations believe that the principle of jurisdictional division must deeply understand the trends, use them as a guide, and assess the environmental needs for adaptation. The Shengsi Islands, under the government's rule, should not be distinguished between Zhejiang or Jiangsu governance. To facilitate governance and comply with popular sentiment, it is necessary to place them under Zhejiang's jurisdiction. The matter concerns our hometown, and we must petition on their behalf. In addition to submitting separate petitions to Chairman Chiang, we are attaching explanations, appealing to "Your Ministry (Ministry of Interior) to review, approve, and promptly send personnel to investigate and place them under Zhejiang's jurisdiction to comply with public opinion." "Your Excellency (Zhejiang Provincial Government) to forward a request to the Ministry of Interior to send personnel to investigate and place them under Zhejiang's jurisdiction to comply with public opinion." "Your Seat (Chairman Chiang) to consider our hometown, promptly preside over the matter, and telegraph the Ministry of Interior and the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments, approving the request to place them under Zhejiang's jurisdiction to comply with public opinion."</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Detective Sues Patrol Officer for Excessive Use of Handcuffs</h3>
<p>Zhao Jinquan, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, was handcuffing a suspected criminal during a pursuit. Due to a lack of procedure, the patrol officer handcuffed Zhao and sent him to the Public Security Bureau along with the suspect. Zhao refused to have the handcuffs removed, so his hands remained cuffed for a long time before they were finally removed. Zhao felt humiliated because he was injured in the line of duty, and his arms were chafed by the handcuffs to the point of skin breakage. He reluctantly went to the local court's prosecutor's office for a wound examination and thorough investigation. The following is a summary of the events: Zhao Jinquan, a 35-year-old detective from Gaoyou, apprehended two men from Shandong, Cai Xiaoyun and Geng Zhongyi, near the Xinqiao area on the west side of Xieqiao on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month. Cai and Geng resisted on the way, and Sergeant Zhang Da, from the Liyuan Road Police Station, noticed the commotion and inquired about the details. Zhao Jinquan claimed, "I am a detective. I saw Cai and Geng colluding in a theft, looking like apprentices from a tobacco shop, with suspicious cash on them, which I witnessed, so I am taking them to the police station." Sergeant Zhang questioned why Zhao did not coordinate with the police on duty when apprehending people along the way. Zhao replied that if he had gone to report to the police on duty, the suspects would have escaped long ago. Both sides insisted on their own versions of the story. As a result, Sergeant Zhang took Zhao Jinquan, Cai Xiaoyun, and Geng Jianyi to the Liland Road Police Station. Patrol Officer Nie Shaowen learned that Zhao claimed that the victim of the theft was Gu Longting, an apprentice at the Xinqiao Laijiu Tobacco Shop, so Gu and the shop owner, Tang Ruiwen, were summoned for questioning. Gu Longting and others testified that no theft had occurred. Patrol Officer Nie was very surprised, but Zhao insisted that the stolen item was red banknotes. When questioned, Cai and Geng claimed they were being framed. Patrol Officer Nie ordered Zhao Jinquan to be handcuffed and sent to the Ximen Branch along with Cai and Geng. After arriving at the branch, Zhao refused to have the handcuffs removed, stating that he must have the approval of the detective team leader before removing them. The next day, under the order of Director Li, the group was sent to the Third Labor Division of the Public Security Bureau. When Zhao refused to remove the handcuffs, he was ordered to be temporarily detained. Later, a team leader summoned him, had a photograph taken of Zhao in handcuffs, and then had the handcuffs removed. Zhao then filed a complaint with the court's prosecutor's office, requesting an examination of the wounds and suing Patrol Officer Nie Shaowen and Sergeant Zhang Da for allegedly handcuffing a public official without fear of escape and causing injuries to his arms. Prosecutor Li Caigui opened a hearing and verified that the wounds were indeed real. He ordered Zhao to return home for treatment and await summons for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Ellergood Road Robbery: Four Thieves Apprehended in Succession</h3>
<p>Three robbers suddenly entered the Fusunxiang Button Shop at No. 128 Ellergood Road in the French Concession on the morning of the 12th, claiming they were renting a house and brandishing pistols. They robbed the store and fled. As the victim chased after them and shouted for help, the robbers opened fire, and the police also drew their guns and returned fire. After a fierce struggle, one robber was shot and wounded, and an eight-year-old Chinese policeman and a young boy walking on the street were injured. As a result, one robber was captured on the spot, and another was later apprehended. Both were taken to the police station for investigation, as reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the wounded robber, Chen Bao, also known as Zhang Guoliang (38 years old, from Changshu), and the captured robber, Liu Yulong (40 years old, from Qingjiang), confessed that the robbery was masterminded by Lin Changgen (28 years old, from Shaoxing), who lived at No. 2 Yuantan Lane, Limei Road. They said that when they went to commit the robbery, Liu and Chen Bao, along with the fugitive Little Guangdong, went together. The chief of police immediately ordered Inspector Jin Jiulin, Chief Detective Zhang Ziying, Detective Xu Youyi, and others to go to Yuan'an Lane and arrest Lin, his mistress Wang, and Chen Shi's mistress Wang. They seized a fake pistol and a large number of stolen goods and brought them back to the police station. Lin Changgen confessed to masterminding the robbery and also confessed to robbing clothing at No. 271 Chang'an Lane, Kaizi'er Road, last month. The seized goods were the ones stolen from Chang'an Lane. The victim at No. 271 Chang'an Lane was Zhu Bingjiang, a 27-year-old employee of the Fubao Bureau from Ningbo, and his wife Jin, 19 years old. They were robbed on the seventh day after their marriage. The bride, Jin, lost her clothes and was frightened by the robbery, crying all day long. It was discovered that Lin's residence was only a dozen houses away from Chang'an Lane, so he knew the details well. It was also discovered that Lin and others had committed crimes in both the British and French concessions and had been tried in court multiple times. The next day, the defendants were sent to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, where Judge Li Changnian questioned them. Since the police requested an extension for investigation, Chinese policemen Nos. 673 and 618 testified in court about the pursuit. The defendants confessed to masterminding the robbery, resisting arrest, and injuring people. The court ordered them to be detained and await further questioning on the 27th. Inspector Jin Jiulin and others have learned that the fugitive robber Little Guangdong, whose real name is Zhang Bingguang, 27 years old, was hiding in Room 20 of the Chonghai Inn at the Yantao Wharf in Nanshi after the incident. Yesterday afternoon at 4 pm, they, along with detectives from the Public Security Bureau, rushed to the address and arrested Tang. He confessed to participating in the robbery and confessed to shooting and killing a victim during a robbery in the Yangshupu area of the Public Concession last month. The chief of police ordered him to be detained and transferred to the Second Court today to request detention for investigation along with the cases of Chen, Liu, and Lin.</p>
<h3>Extortion Case Contents Complex: Man and Woman Had Previous Relationship, Extortion Letter Stored at Police Station for Examination</h3>
<p>Zhang Meisheng from Huzhou recently wrote an extortion letter and delivered it to Ding Ni, a widow from Nanjing, at No. 505 Haining Road, demanding ten yuan. He arranged to collect the money at a certain place on Jiangxi Road between 9 am and 10 am the day before yesterday, otherwise, he would take drastic measures. After receiving the letter, Ding reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese and Western detectives from the West Division went to No. 110 Haixiao Road at the appointed time and arrested him. He was taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday, he was transferred to the First Local Court. Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Works Department stated that the defendant completely denied writing the letter to extort money from Ding at the police station. The letter is currently stored at the police station for handwriting examination. The case is very complex. According to the cause, on the 4th of this month, a landlady of a congee shop on Baidun Road lost a table and asked the defendant to find it, paying him one yuan. However, he ignored it. Later, the plaintiff questioned him, causing him to resent her and write an extortion letter. He had a previous relationship with her, and the defendant had committed thirteen cases of assault, opium smoking, and theft in the past. According to Ding Ni's testimony, she has known the defendant for many years. Before this, he had borrowed ten yuan from her at the Potang bathhouse and threatened her with a small knife when she refused. The defendant confessed that he had a relationship with Ding for half a year, but recently he abandoned her for another woman. He denied writing the extortion letter and stealing the table, claiming that the Potang loan and the knife threat were false accusations. Judge Feng Shide ordered him to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>

<h3>Famous Huizhou Doctor Cheng Anchen Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Cheng Anchen from Xingjiang was indifferent to officialdom in his early years and devoted himself to medicine. He became proficient in medical skills and was usually low-key and did not flaunt his skills. However, when fellow villagers and relatives had difficult or serious illnesses that other doctors could not treat, they would often seek his diagnosis. He would prescribe medicine according to the symptoms, and almost invariably, he would bring them back to life. Because of his profound knowledge and precise understanding of pulse diagnosis, he could always trace the source of the disease when treating it, and thus he became known as a good doctor in his time. Last year, due to banditry in Huizhou, he sought refuge in Shanghai to promote his benevolent art and practice medicine to save the world. He is currently residing at No. 26, Xintai'an Lane, Tiantong Road. People in Shanghai who are suffering from illness should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>Shanghai 14th Sanitation Week Special Edition</p>
<h3>Preface to the Special Edition of the 14th Shanghai Sanitation Week</h3>
<p>— Li Tingan</p>
<p>The meaning of the Sanitation Week is to conduct large-scale sanitation publicity, and instill various sanitation common sense into the minds of the general public. Making them thoroughly understand the meaning of sanitation, improving health, is strengthening our country, and strengthening our nation. In this year's 14th Sanitation Week, the Municipal Health Bureau deeply recognizes that in order to achieve great effectiveness, it is necessary to cooperate with all sectors of society. Therefore, it has jointly worked with the health authorities of the concession and more than 20 organizations and groups in the city to open on June 15. I checked the sanitation in this city. The cause is progressing year by year, so the spirit of the Sanitation Week is also more exciting year by year. This year, smoking cessation and drug rehabilitation were also incorporated into the Sanitation Week. Various specimens, models, charts, and books and periodicals on hygiene, etc., in the exhibition hall were collected as much as possible and opened for reading. I hope that all citizens can recognize them, and after recognition, they must also personally implement the following two things. On the one hand, implement various personal hygiene methods, and on the other hand, help the progress of public health. The Association specifically commissioned major newspapers in the city to compile and print special editions for the purpose of widespread publicity, so I will briefly say a few words to the readers about the reasons for holding the Sanitation Week.</p>
<h3>A Message to the Citizens for the Holding of the Sanitation Week</h3>
<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Today, as we hold the Sanitation Week, I would like to briefly explain the important meaning of sanitation, hoping that all sectors of the city will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>In recent years, almost all people who are slightly knowledgeable, no matter where they are, have known the term sanitation, but there are still not many people who have a correct understanding of the meaning of sanitation. People generally regard the word sanitation as a very fashionable new term, and put it on top of the names of things in order to be clever, and even use it to attract customers, but often the name does not match the reality. Some poor people without knowledge sometimes persuade them to pay attention to sanitation, and they will say: "We don't even have food to eat, so what are we talking about sanitation!" Some elderly people will even say to others: "We have never talked about sanitation, and we have lived to such an old age!" These people have not understood the true meaning of sanitation; in fact, people all love life and hate death, and like to be healthy and free from disease, so can they deny the importance of sanitation!</p>
<p>In short, the word "hygiene" means "protecting life" or "maintaining health." All things in the world are roughly divided into two categories: living things and non-living things. Living things are further divided into two major categories: animals and plants. Whether they are animals or plants, they all have the instinct of "life" and "reproduction", but they cannot escape the general rules of "metabolism", "survival of the fittest", and "survival of the fittest", so all living things have birth and death. During their survival period, they must be able to exert their inherent ability to "protect life" in order to adapt to the environment and live. Even if it is a protozoa or bacteria whose body structure is just a single cell, it must also have this ability in order to live, but the simple living conditions are extremely simple, and the more complicated the living conditions, the more complicated the ability to protect life is. This only refers to living things that rely on "instinct" to protect life. When it comes to human beings protecting life, especially modern human beings, it is not so simple.</p>
<p>Among living things, animals live more complicatedly, and plants live more simply. Naturally, their ability to protect life is more complicated in animals than in plants. Human beings are rich in reason and occupy the highest position among animals, and are also the most outstanding among living things. Their ability to protect life is naturally</p>
<p>The population is becoming increasingly dense, and it seems that the competition between humans and beasts has passed, and the competition between humans is fierce. However, in fact, the competition between humans is still easy to avoid. What should be paid attention to and has become a problem is the enemy of different kinds of diseases that can be seen with the naked eye, namely pathogenic microorganisms (pathogenic protozoa, bacteria). This type of enemy is almost always attacking our side, using our human body as their colony. The result is to absorb our fat and cut off our lives. The cruelty of their brutality is more than that of giant guns, so our sanitation methods can never rely solely on the simplest instinct. We humans should stand on the same front and use proper methods to fight this enemy (pathogenic microorganisms) to seek a final victory. If we abandon ourselves and do not resist prevention, these tiny villains will eventually gain an inch, and the most outstanding living things are in danger of being killed by the lowest living things.</p>
<p>The Sanitation Week is held every year as usual. If we do not pay attention to the traces of the past, the actual situation of the present, and the hopes for the future, it can be said that it is superfluous and useless. Therefore, we must embrace the purpose of daily renewal and constant renewal, and compare the achievements of the past and the present, and pre-set the goals for future improvement, so that there will be progress.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a bustling industrial and commercial hub, with people sweating like rain and chimneys blocking the sun. The health and hygiene of the working citizens who taste the bitter diseases is the top priority.</p>

<h3>Sanitation Movement and National Revival</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingshi</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a nation, from its surface point of view, is certainly in the integrity of the country's military equipment and the understanding of the people's knowledge, but in fact, it is attributed to the ability of the nation to compete with nature for survival. This information is more clear when verified by the history of the rise and fall of various nations in the East and West. Looking at Europe before the Middle Ages, Greece and Rome, based on their spirit of advocating martial arts and competition, were determined, brave, and unyielding, and finally established ancient countries of civilization and evolution in the world. When they declined, it was again derived from the erosion of extravagance and debauchery, the immersion of women in pigeon wine, and the disappearance of the ability to compete with nature for survival was the only reason. As for our country, the Tang and Yu dynasties are no exception. The people of the Han and Tang dynasties also had the spirit of courage, advancement, going through fire and water, and acting recklessly regardless of everything. Therefore, they were finally able to cleanse the oppression of foreign nations and establish the prestige of the great empire of East Asia. Their ability to compete with nature for survival was no less than that of Greece and Rome. However, since the Zhao and Song dynasties, the wind of abandoning martial arts and cultivating literature and the wind of self-effacement and seeking peace have been deeply rooted among the members of the entire nation, and have become more and more prosperous day by day. The ability of our nation to compete with nature for survival has gradually disappeared, and eventually led to the invasion of foreign nations, and there has been no sign of recovery through the four dynasties of Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing. Therefore, the philosophers of the Song and Ming dynasties, such as Zhou Gan, Zhang Zhu, and Wang Yangming, Lu Xiangshan and other predecessors, the key to their learning and cultivating virtue, all revealed the four characters of living in reverence and exploring reason. Living in reverence is to strengthen the body, and exploring reason is to enlighten the mind, which is also to seek to restore our nation's ability to compete with nature for survival. However, due to the deep-rooted diseases and the heavy accumulation of difficulties, although they have been advocating for six or seven hundred, they have not been able to show their acupuncture effect among the entire nation, until the end of the Qing Dynasty, and the Western powers took advantage of their capital, finance, ship-firm guns and sharp power to invade the withered and tired China. The ethnic revival movement, on the one hand, preserves our nation's inherent knowledge and abilities, and on the other hand, absorbs the unique strengths of other nations, and takes the restoration of the nation's ability to compete with nature for survival as the only direction of its efforts. In recent years, the country's training of national physique and the improvement of public and private health are all based on this direction to directly seek the increase of national physical strength, and indirectly seek the improvement of the ability to compete for survival. However, due to the relationship between talent and financial resources, it is impossible to carry out a widespread and large-scale movement, so that all members of the entire nation can have a full understanding and the determination to comply with it, which is a pity. Now the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau can pay attention to this and have the Sanitation Week, which will benefit the nation. The sincerity is not shallow, and I am so pleased that I dare to express my wild opinion.</p>

<h3>Construction Status of the National Games Venue: The Main Buildings Are of Three Types and Their Scale Is Unparalleled in the Far East</h3>
<p>The Sixth National Games will be held at the newly built Shanghai Municipal Stadium in the central district of Shanghai from the Double Tenth Festival this year to October 20th. The preparatory office was moved to the Municipal Stadium in May, and at the same time, because the Municipal Stadium is located in Jiangwan, a branch office was set up at the Shanghai National Sports Federation Association in Shen Garden, Yanping Road, to facilitate contact with all parties. The Preparatory Committee is now making the greatest efforts to ensure the success of the Games. The competition rules, etc., have long been discussed and announced, and have been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. A preparatory work report is also issued every half month. As for the construction and equipment of the venue, work is currently being carried out actively. The Organizing Committee hereby announces the construction status of the venue as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Magnificent Scale, Unparalleled in the Far East</p>
<p>The Games venue (i.e., Shanghai Municipal Stadium) is being built by the Shanghai Municipal Government at a cost of one million yuan, covering an area of 300 acres. Its main buildings are three: a sports field (i.e., athletics field), a gymnasium, and a swimming pool. They are designed with reference to famous European and American sports fields. The scale is magnificent, and the layout is complete, far surpassing the Central Stadium. Even in the Far East, it can be called unparalleled.</p>
<p>(2) Construction Status of the Sports Field</p>
<p>The field is shaped like a chain, with a total width of 175 meters (574 feet) including the stands, and a total length of 330 meters (1,082 feet). The stands are built like city walls, about 10 meters (31 feet) high, and are made of steel and cement, which is extremely magnificent. The area of the field is 37,500 square meters (404,000 square feet). The center is a football field, volleyball field, national martial arts field, and field event equipment, surrounded by a 500-meter track. There is a straight track with a length of 200 meters on both the east and west sides. Outside the track, there are three tennis courts and three basketball courts on the north and south ends. The perimeter of the stands is about 760 meters (2,500 feet) long and about 17 meters (55 feet) wide, and can accommodate 60,000 people sitting or standing.</p>
<p>Under the stands are dormitories for athletes. In addition to accommodating 2,500 people, there are also spare rooms for shops, public toilets, and ticket offices. In front of it is a very wide corridor, which not only helps to shield from the wind and sun, but also provides shelter for the audience in case of rainstorms. Other facilities such as rest rooms, offices, exhibition rooms, information offices, wireless broadcasting stations, and dining rooms are all available and extremely complete, comparable to world-class sports fields.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that tens of thousands of spectators can enter and exit the stands quickly and orderly, 38 doors are set up, evenly distributed around the entire field. Each door can accommodate 1,200 people, so after the competition is over, tens of thousands of spectators can exit completely within five minutes without causing congestion. Each door is equipped with iron railings to facilitate ticket collectors to maintain order in case of crowding.</p>
<p>A magnificent gate is built in the center of the east and west sides of the field to facilitate the entry and exit of athletes in formation. Vehicles can also directly reach the field from here. Two special stands are set up above them, facing each other from east to west, with a magnificent atmosphere. These special stands are for VIPs and newspaper reporters. Twenty telephones are installed in the press box for rent by various newspapers to transmit news of the Games. The entire stand and the dormitory rooms under the stand have been completed. From a distance, it looks like a great city wall. The construction of the track and other planes will begin in the future, and it is expected to be completed by the beginning of September.</p>
<p>(3) Construction Status of the Gymnasium</p>
<p>This hall can be used for indoor sports, as well as for gatherings, exhibitions, and theatrical performances. The capacity is 3,500 seats and 1,500 standing spaces. If necessary, temporary seats can be added around the walls of the sports hall. The sports hall is located in the center of the hall building. The floor is covered with teak wood, 23 meters (75 feet) wide and 40 meters (131 feet) long. Three ordinary basketball courts can be arranged. During official competitions, only a larger court is set up in the center, with more space left around it. The total width of the hall building is 46 meters (150 feet) and the length is 82 meters (270 feet). The stands around the sports hall are supported by sturdy steel and cement beams and brick walls, with a width of 11 meters (36 feet) and a total of 16 steps.</p>
<p>A staircase is set up on each side of the hall inside the main entrance, and the audience can directly reach the stands from here. Side doors and narrower staircases are set up on both sides of the hall building behind the hall to facilitate the audience to exit the hall from here. The walls on the front of the hall building are made of artificial stone. Its form contains modern artistic colors and is decorated with national patterns. The rest of the outer walls are built with red bricks, and the coping and plinth are inlaid with artificial stone.</p>
<p>Entering from the main entrance is the lobby. Ticket offices are set up on both sides, and further in is the hall. Men's and women's toilets and staircases leading to the stands are set up on both sides. Further in is a corridor leading directly to the sports hall (basketball court) and the gym in the back. Beside the corridor are offices and reception rooms. Passing through another door on each side are the men's and women's changing rooms and shower rooms, from which you can reach the sports hall, gym, and sports equipment storage room. Kitchens and boiler rooms are set up on both sides of the gym. The lighting of the sports hall and gym is high-angle to avoid glare for athletes. The heating equipment is low-pressure, and the condensed water from the heating is returned to the steam boiler by an automatic pump. Motorized fans are used to distribute warm air in the sports hall and gym, while other parts directly use heat radiation for heating. It is truly the most perfect gymnasium in the East. The project is now two-thirds completed.</p>
<p>(4) Construction Status of the Swimming Pool</p>
<p>The pool is open-air, surrounded by a large steel and cement stand that can accommodate five to six thousand spectators. Under the stand are changing rooms, shower rooms, rest rooms, shops, public toilets, boiler rooms, and water filtration rooms. A magnificent main entrance is set up on the north side of the stand. Inside the entrance are offices, living rooms, halls, and ticket offices. Wide corridors are built on the east, west, and south sides of the stand to meet the needs of the audience to avoid rain. The pool is 50 meters long and 20 meters wide. The bottom of the pool is spoon-shaped in the direction of the long side, starting from a depth of 1.1 meters (3.5 feet) at one end, gradually deepening to 1.7 meters (5.5 feet) towards the center, and then dropping steeply from the center to a depth of 3.5 meters (11.5 feet) 5 meters (16 feet) from the other end (this depth is the one adopted by the Far Eastern Games). The bottom of the pool and the edges of the pool are paved with white mosaics, and the walls are tiled with white porcelain tiles. The water capacity is 2,200 cubic meters (600,000 gallons). If this huge amount of water is replaced frequently, the cost will be high, and it will take 10 hours each time, which is also very inconvenient. Therefore, water filtration equipment is installed to turn the turbid water out of the pool, back into clear water, and then return it to the pool for continuous circulation. There are five stages for each circulation: (1) disinfection, (2) filtration, (3) entering the pool, (4) circulation, (5) exiting the pool. This filtration work can continue non-stop during the swimming season. After each disinfection and filtration, the water quality becomes cleaner.</p>
<p>The pool's lighting equipment adopts the latest style, that is, strong light bulbs are placed inside the pool wall under the water surface, so that the light and water can form a whole "light source". It is very pleasing to the eye at night. Such a setting of lights is not only not dazzling, but also facilitates rescue, truly killing two birds with one stone. The wall of the main entrance is made of artificial stone and decorated with carvings to show the color of national art. The rest of the walls are built with red bricks, and artificial stone is used for the plinth and coping. The architectural shape and color are compatible with the sports field and gymnasium. The project is four-fifths completed and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>(5) Others</p>
<p>In addition to the above three major buildings, another field will be opened in the central part of the entire venue for baseball games, etc. The Games will center around the sports field to facilitate the viewing of the public. The various other venues, which are intended for the daily use of the citizens of Shanghai, will be added after the Games are completed.</p>

<h3>Provinces and Cities Report on Compulsory Education Funds: Shandong Province Adds a Surtax and Can Collect 800,000 Yuan Annually</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th) Regarding the matter of provinces and cities raising funds for compulsory education, Shanghai, Ping, Su, and Sui continued to send telegrams to the Ministry of Education on the 13th. Shanghai has determined the 26th annual fund to be 200,000 yuan. Ping will raise half of the 80,000 yuan itself. Su will raise 150,000 yuan. Sui has determined to raise an additional 100,000 yuan in the 26th annual fund. Other provinces such as Gan and Dian are making great efforts to raise funds.</p>
<p>(Jinan, 14th) To promote compulsory education in this province, it is proposed to add a surtax of 2.5 jiao to each tael of silver, which will be used as a regular annual fund, and 800,000 yuan can be collected annually.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th) After the outline of the compulsory education implementation methods drafted by the Ministry of Education was resolved by the Central Government, the three ministers of the ministry telegraphed each province and city to quickly raise funds for local compulsory education. Now, telegrams have been received by the ministry from 14 provinces and cities, including Ji and Gui, expressing gratitude for the central government's allocation of funds to assist in local compulsory education, and striving to raise local funds. For example, Anhui will raise more than 290,000 yuan on its own in the 26th annual fund. Zhejiang Province plans to set up an average of 15 one-year short-term elementary schools in each county, which will require a total of 330,000 yuan. The province and county will jointly raise half of the funds, which can be borne. Shi Qiwan of Hubei Province counted the number of short-term elementary schools in each county. The first year should require 380,000 yuan. Minister Wang and Mayor Ma agreed to complete the first phase of compulsory education in Beijing within two years in advance.</p>
<h3>Jiang Menglin and Zhang Boling Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Beijing Correspondent) Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, telegraphed all national university presidents across the country to go to Beijing before the 15th to participate in the first session of the councilor election meeting of the academy. Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University in Pingfang, Xu Songming, President of Ping University, and Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University, were originally scheduled to go to Beijing together on the 11th. Later, the meeting was postponed due to some reason. Jiang went south first.</p>
<p>Jiang, Xu, and Mei Consulted: At 8:00 am on the 13th, Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, Xu Songming, President of Ping University, and Mei Yiqi, President of Tsinghua University, consulted once again and decided to ask Jiang to go south first to inquire about the exact date of the postponement and the date of the meeting from the Academia Sinica. Then Xu and Mei will decide when to go.</p>
<p>Jiang Menglin Goes to Beijing: Jiang Menglin, President of Peking University, and Mrs. Jiang Menglin, Tao Zenggu, went to the station. Jiang said that the purpose of this trip was to go to the Academia Sinica to inquire about the exact date of the council meeting, and there was no other task. The date of returning to Ping must wait until after the meeting. During my absence from Ping, the school affairs will be temporarily responsible by the heads of each department.</p>
<p>Xu Songming Talked: The reporter met Xu Songming, President of Ping University, and said that the exact date of the postponement has not been ascertained, so President Jiang was specially asked to go south first, and after the exact date is ascertained, I will go to Beijing with President Mei.</p>
<p>Li Zheng Delays Returning North: Li Zheng, President of Normal University, went to the Wuxi Education College to discuss the annual meeting of the Social Education Society held in Ping and to report on school affairs in Beijing. He was originally scheduled to return to Ping on the 14th, but it has now been postponed for some reason.</p>
<p>Zhang Boling Goes to Beijing: (Xuzhou, 13th) Zhang Boling, President of Nankai University, passed through Xuzhou from Tianjin to Beijing at noon on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Supervisor Zhong from the Ministry of Education Inspects and Expresses Hope for Vocational Education in the Province</h3>
<p>The following is a summary of Supervisor Zhong Daozan's report on his inspection of vocational education in Hebei Province:</p>
<p>The province's vocational education funding in the 22nd year of the Republic only accounted for 6.9% of the province's secondary education funding, which is far from the Ministry's set standard. Since the 23rd year, excessive normal school classes have been cut, and the remaining funds have been used to supplement vocational schools. As a result, vocational education has gradually gained a foundation, and it is expected to reach 25% by the 26th year. It is found that the province currently has two provincial agricultural vocational schools, two provincial industrial vocational schools, one provincial commercial vocational school, five commercial vocational classes attached to the provincial commercial college and middle schools in Tianjin, and two vocational classes in the provincial aquatic products college. Additionally, the Shimen Industrial Vocational School is currently under preparation. Furthermore, there are quite a few vocational normal schools in Tianjin. Upon reviewing the content, the equipment of the vocational department of the Industrial College is well-equipped, the Baoding Industrial Vocational School has achieved considerable results, the efforts of the provincial Yi County Agricultural Vocational School and the municipal normal vocational classes, the cooperation of the Gaoyang Private Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School with factories, and the focus on practical work of the Huolu County Dyeing and Weaving School are all serious and practical, and quite promising. However, most private vocational schools in the counties have simple equipment and incomplete management. Moreover, in terms of the actual needs of each nuclear site, most are also unsuitable. The inspection opinions are listed as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Regarding vocational teacher training in the province, it is planned that the department will select a number of graduates from universities or various disciplines on one hand, and order each vocational school to recommend a number of existing teachers according to their actual needs on the other hand. The department will separately introduce them to factories or experimental institutions inside and outside the province for one to two years of research to improve their skills. The expenses will be provided by the department. The method is very good, but it should also use the holidays to lecture on subjects related to teaching management to ensure properness.</p>
<p>2.  The provincial vocational schools in the province still charge a small amount of tuition fees, which in fact does not greatly benefit the school's funding, but rather hinders the schooling of vocational youths who are aspiring to study. It should be abolished.</p>
<p>3.  The standard of recurring expenses for vocational schools in the province has been raised according to regulations at the primary level, but has not yet been implemented at the advanced level, causing great difficulties for the schools. It should be increased separately according to the nature of each subject of industry, agriculture, and commerce.</p>
<p>4.  Although the practical training in various vocational schools has increased more than before, due to the limitation of time and the heavy content of learning, it is impossible to obtain proficient skills. An immediate order should be issued to all schools regarding the number of hours of practical training in vocational subjects, which must be complied with in accordance with regulations, and a summer practical training method should be formulated and implemented within a time limit to remedy this.</p>
<p>5.  The vocational education program promoted by the province has been approved by the Ministry for record. It should follow the original plan to reduce the normal school and use the savings to enrich the existing vocational schools and add new schools. No excuses should be used to change it, which would hinder progress.</p>
<p>6.  Tangshan is an industrial area of ​​Hebei. The most needed industrial vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools should be set up in consideration of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>7.  The vocational department of the Industrial College is managed very well, but a closer examination reveals that the complex parts of its products are mostly made by craftsmen, and students only learn the methods. The technology seems to be lacking in proficiency, and centralized practice should be implemented during the holidays. At the same time, according to the original method of the school, a number of outstanding graduates from each class should be selected each year to stay in the school for further research to deepen their knowledge.</p>
<p>8.  The leather production of the chemical department of the Industrial College has always been contracted by outside workers. It should refer to the methods of the apprentice class of the mechanical engineering department to recruit apprentices to learn production.</p>
<p>9.  The commercial vocational department of the Franco-Chinese Business College and the commercial department of Tianjin Middle School should have been merged with the provincial Tianjin Commercial Vocational School. Due to factual difficulties, they are still run by the original school until the original students graduate. This is acceptable, but the practical training time and equipment, commodity research, Chinese and Western typing, economics, business conditions, investigation, and advertising skills are not sufficient and should be improved. Ordinary homework such as biology and foreign geography, each for three hours per week, should be deleted from the junior vocational class, and attention should be paid to calligraphy, commercial drawing, abacus, and understanding of old-style accounting methods to be practical.</p>
<p>10. The students of the private Tianjin Hongde and Zhihui Commercial Schools are very developed. After graduation, most of them are engaged in foreign commercial firms and bank post office positions. Those who go on to higher education account for more than 30%. Excessive emphasis is placed on foreign languages ​​and Chinese, and few can actually use what they have learned. Furthermore, each school focuses on lecturing on subjects, without investigation, research, visits, and practical facilities. Improvements should be made.</p>
<p>11. The teaching hours of history, English, and Chinese in the general commercial department of the provincial Tianjin Commercial School and military training, algebra, and geometry in the accounting department are too many and should be reduced appropriately. The total number of class hours per week should be appropriately increased. The school building is rented from civilian houses, which are narrow and cannot be expanded. Methods should be found to move it.</p>
<p>12. The vocational department of the provincial aquatic products college has very little practical training in the first and second academic years. The fishing department has one or two months of maritime practice in the sixth semester, and the rest are done in the school laboratory. It is said that students cannot endure hardship and should use the holidays for practical training to develop a habit of hard work. Furthermore, the school adds many academic hours in order to prepare students for further education, which is also inappropriate. The problem of moving the school site should also be resolved quickly in accordance with the order.</p>
<p>13. The home economics department and specialized courses of the provincial and municipal women's normal colleges have achieved good results. However, (1) the distribution of courses seems to focus on painting and music. More attention should be paid to children's psychology, hygiene, nursing, family science, and food chemistry. The subject of educational administration should be deleted. (2) Attention should be paid to the research of families with different economic capabilities, as a case study. Home economics practice should also pay more attention to the solution of lower-middle class family problems and how to improve them. (3) Home economics practice should pay more attention to investigation, visits, and practical family internships, and should not be limited to school work. (4) The equipment should be used to add advanced home economics vocational courses. When necessary, normal school subjects should be taught to train elementary school labor teachers.</p>
<p>14. The Provincial Baoding Advanced Industrial Vocational School has a long history and excellent equipment. Unfortunately, most of the machinery is old-fashioned and not precise enough. New machinery should be added as soon as possible. Students' practical skills are not proficient enough and must be practiced during the holidays. The teaching of each subject is serious, and the compiled lecture notes have been revised for many years and are still suitable. They can be selected for publication for reference by other schools. The school had a female class, which stopped recruiting last year. It is found that the entire province of Hebei still lacks female vocational schools. Many neighboring counties of Baoding use dyeing and weaving as a common family production business. The school should continue to recruit. The school currently has ten classes of students but only receives the funding of thirteen classes. The management feels difficult and messy. The funding should be given according to the number of classes, otherwise the classes should be merged.</p>
<p>15. The Yi County and Huangcun Agricultural Vocational Schools in the province were established not long ago, and their achievements are not obvious. The Yi County Agriculture and Forestry Fields have a good environment and a large area, and progress is very promising. However, the school plans to increase to ten classes. In reality, there are many students in the first grade, fewer in the second and third grades, and even fewer in the fourth and fifth grades. In order to take into account the facts, a part of the funding should be released for the implementation of farmers' supplementary education and promotion work. It is not necessary to rigidly recruit ten classes. The Huangcun Agricultural Field is smaller, and facilities are difficult. All farming and agricultural product manufacturing tools are extremely lacking. The school's accumulated more than 2,000 yuan should be fully enriched, and attention should still be paid to holiday practice. The subjects of geography and history can be deleted, and the practical training time should be increased. The school buildings of the two schools are not enough and should be rebuilt. However, the focus should be on simplicity and solidity, saving expenses, and adding teaching equipment.</p>
<p>16. The Tianjin Municipal Normal Vocational Normal Department is divided into instrument specimen and home craft groups, each divided into pre- and post-vocational normal schools. In addition to vocational subjects for 12 to 14 hours per week, the rest of the pre-period is for general subjects, and the rest of the post-period is for education and general subjects. The distribution is not very appropriate. For the first three years, half of the time should be devoted to vocational training, and the rest should be general subjects. In the latter three years, vocational training still accounts for one-half, and the remaining half of the time is divided equally between general and educational subjects. In this way, the technology is proficient, which can be used as a labor teacher in primary schools, and also as a teacher in junior or supplementary vocational schools.</p>
<p>17. The junior woodworking vocational class of the 35th Municipal Primary School meets the environmental needs. Students have a very good practical spirit, and the teaching progress and time allocation are still reasonable. However, in order to meet the environmental requirements, ordinary architectural knowledge can be added in the third academic year, and the term can also be extended as appropriate. The woodworking labor group originally set up in the senior primary school department should be restored so that those who volunteer to join the woodworking class can practice the preliminary foundation, and attention should be paid to the accuracy of the work, the development of the ability to draw and draft habits. At the same time, new tools, methods and styles must be gradually used to seek the modernity of skills.</p>
<p>18. The Gaoyang Private Junior Dyeing and Weaving Vocational School is not large in scale. All the equipment is sufficient for the practical training of three classes of students. Senior students often go to dyeing and weaving factories outside the school for practical training to gain practical experience. Graduates still have a way out. However, there is no fixed monthly funding and it all depends on the Chamber of Commerce to raise funds, which is very difficult to maintain. The department should provide subsidies in accordance with regulations to encourage it. Most of the elementary schools attached to the school enter the vocational class after graduation. In order to improve efficiency, basic dyeing and weaving practice of five or six hours per week can be given in the high school grades. The Huolu County Dyeing and Weaving School, which is similar to the school's management situation, should also be given considerable financial assistance by the department.</p>
<p>19. There are a total of 23 provincial and county junior vocational schools or classes in the province. Except for Gaoyang and Huolu, most of them are simple. The rectification methods formulated by the department should be implemented quickly to seek improvement.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Implements Compulsory Literacy Education: Preliminary Methods Have Been Adopted</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang, 14th) The provincial government has passed the preliminary methods for implementing compulsory literacy education in various counties and stipulates that the county head, education bureau chief, and public security bureau chief are absolutely responsible for promotion, hoping to achieve the greatest effect in the shortest time. The organizational outline and implementation points of the Jiangsu Provincial Compulsory Literacy Education Committee have also been passed.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Orders Counties to Allocate the Number of Normal School Graduates Serving: No Excuses for Teacher Surplus Allowed</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education yesterday issued instructions to the governments and education bureaus of various counties such as Shanghai, and public and private normal schools, stating that the "Provisional Regulations on Service of Normal School Graduates in Jiangsu Province" stipulates that high school normal department graduates should serve in the local area for three years from the date of graduation. The service area is based on the local county. The Education Bureau considers the actual situation and allocates service locations. Normal school graduates who do not comply with the specified service period without proper reasons should be ordered to repay tuition and various fees. This year's normal school student graduation examination has been completed, and the examination results are being calculated. First, the students who participated in the examination are counted separately by county to prepare for the allocation of service locations in each county. The bureau chief should allocate all the statistical numbers in the county and must not make excuses for teacher surplus and inability to appoint, and make excuses. Normal school graduates who do not follow the specified service period should also be recovered for tuition fees and various fees. In addition to waiting for the students to finish their internships and determine whether they will graduate, their names will be notified and distributed separately. The combined statistics table is printed and distributed to the county head, bureau chief, etc., for compliance, and the number of allocations should be reported. This order.</p>
<h3>Contributions of the June Issue of the "Shen Bao Monthly": Discussion of Youth's Pursuit of Education and Employment</h3>
<p>The "Shen Bao Monthly" held a discussion meeting last time (May issue) to discuss the most noteworthy "Foreign Silver Prices and Currency System Issues" in the current Chinese financial community. The publication of its records has been deeply praised by people from all walks of life and readers from all over the world. As the summer vacation is approaching, a large number of graduates who urgently seek employment will be added to the society. Although middle school graduates from middle-class families or above have the possibility of further education after graduation, which school to enter, which subject to study, and where the future is, are all problems at hand and in the future. There are many young students who are troubled by the problems of seeking education and employment. Last year, Peking University students launched the "Vocational Alliance" because there was no way to go after graduation. Scholars from Beijing and Shanghai expressed their sympathy and support. In view of this, the magazine specially published the records of the discussion meeting on "Youth's Pursuit of Education and Employment" in the June issue to share with all walks of life. The participants are all experienced educational scholars, such as Tai Shuangqiu, Ni Wenlei, Ma Chonggan, Zhang Zhirang, Yu Qingtang, Huang Yanpei, Hu Shuyi, Jiang Wenyu, and Gao Jiansi. They analyzed the relationship between production and education, knowledge, ability and occupational issues, the needs and distribution of talents, etc., based on the actual situation in my country. What they said is in line with the current malpractices. In addition, it also contains Chen Lijiang's "Chinese Education Transformation Issues Before the Month," which points out the necessity and path of Chinese education transformation. All those who pay attention to Chinese education issues, as well as young students across the country, are worth reading. The magazine is currently holding a special price for the third anniversary. Subscribing to the magazine during the special price period, including postage, costs only two yuan.</p>

<h3>Acorn Vacuum Tube No. 954</h3>
<p>-- Yong Yan</p>
<p>The acorn vacuum tube No. 954 (Acorn tube 954) is a pentode for ultra-short waves produced after the No. 955 triode.</p>
<p>Because No. 954 needs to be used for radio frequency amplification at ultra-short wavelengths, the inter-electrode capacitance is minimized during design. The screen electrode is connected from the top of the tube, and the control grid is connected from the bottom of the tube. The screen-to-grid capacitance is only 0.007 picofarads (when using a special shielding plate), so it can still work on a wavelength of 0.7 meters.</p>
<p>The size of No. 954 is similar to that of No. 955. The connection method of each electrode and its external shape are shown in the figure. The height is 1 and 11/16 inches, and the diameter is 1 and 3/32 inches. Because of its small size, it can be used in various ways, such as in vacuum tube voltmeters and as a preamplifier for capacitor microphones. No. 954 is not only suitable for radio frequency amplification, but also can be used as a detection or audio frequency amplifier. It can also be used as a triode, tetrode, or pentode depending on the connection method. Use a special tube socket when using. Its characteristics are as follows:</p>
<p>Filament voltage (AC or DC) 6.3 volts</p>
<p>Filament current 0.15 amps</p>
<p>Plate voltage during Class A amplification 250 volts</p>
<p>Screen grid voltage 100 volts</p>
<p>Control grid voltage -3 volts</p>
<p>The shield grid is connected to the cathode (on the tube socket)</p>
<p>Amplification factor greater than 2000</p>
<p>Transconductance 1400 micromhos</p>
<p>Plate current 2 milliamps</p>
<p>Screen grid current 0.5 milliamps</p>
<p>When detecting, the characteristics are similar to those of 57 or 606.</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio Pen</h3>
<p>-- Pao</p>
<p>The new uses of wireless radio are developing day by day. From the initial wireless telegraph, it has gradually advanced to wireless telephone, and then to television. This is the development of the main branch of wireless radio. In addition, the collateral uses are countless. For example, it is used to explore unmanned aircraft or ships, transmit electricity, treat certain diseases, and kill harmful insects. The "wireless radio pen" is also one of them.</p>
<p>The "wireless radio pen" (Catbautograph or radio pen) was invented by Allen B. Dumont in the United States. It was publicly tested at the American Electrical Wireless Radio Exhibition. Clarence L. Law, chairman of the New York Electrical Association, used a special metal pen in front of the machine to write on a small board in front of the machine. The same green characters appeared on a special screen in another corner of the venue.</p>
<p>In Figure A, it can be seen that Mr. Di is using his wireless radio pen. He writes on a small board in front of the machine with a special metal pen in front of the portable machine. The same characters appear on the round screen above the machine. At the same time, the characters also appear on another round screen in the distance under control. Please see Figure B for the principle. The metal pen in the machine is connected to a pen arm. The pen arm is connected to a contact point that slides back and forth and left and right on two sets of wire-wound resistors placed at right angles. If current flows through this resistor, a variable voltage equivalent to the movement of the metal pen can be obtained at the contact point. After this variable voltage is transmitted, it is received by the receiver in the distance and applied to the deflection plate of the cathode tube to control its electron flow (i.e., cathode ray). This controlled electron flow is directed to a special fluorescent round screen in the tube, producing the same green characters.</p>
<p>This type of wireless radio pen has a shortcoming, that is, the characters on the round screen cannot be retained for a long time. When writing to the eleventh character, the first character gradually fades and disappears. Therefore, the original inventor is still continuing research to seek a longer retention of the characters.</p>
<p>The wireless radio pen and television have some of the same parts that use cathode rays, but the rest are completely different. It is also different from the "facsimile telegraph" because it does not have any optical relationship other than using electron flow to generate characters.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Amateur Wireless Radio in the Soviet Union (Continued)</h3>
<p>-- Yan Shanzhi</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, amateurs can be divided into three levels: first, second, and third. Third-level amateurs, that is, beginners, must be able to receive a total of ten words (fifty letters) of wireless radio code per minute, know the communication procedures, and know the general principles of wireless radio. However, those engaged in production industries and members of special groups only need to listen to about six words (thirty letters) per minute. The power of the antenna is only allowed to be 20 watts, and the wavelengths used are only a few such as 5 meters, 10 meters, 40 meters, and 80 meters. When using 40 meters, the communication time can only be from 0:00 (12:00) Moscow Standard Time to 8:00 the next morning, and the tone of the transmission must be different from other wavelengths. However, there is no such restriction on other wavelengths. This type accounts for about 6% of the national amateurs.</p>
<p>Second-level amateurs, or intermediate-level amateurs, need to take some deeper wireless radio science and basic knowledge of electricity than the first level. The listening skills also reach 16 words (90 letters) per minute. If they are engaged in production industries or members of special groups, 1,000 words (50 letters) per minute is sufficient. The antenna power can be used up to 40 watts, and the wavelengths used are 5 meters, 10 meters, 40 meters, 80 meters, and 160 meters. If they obtain a special permit from the "Central Bureau of Shortwave Department," they can also use the 20-meter wavelength. They can be free from the restrictions of time and power supply. This level of amateurs accounts for about four-fifths of the country.</p>
<p>First-level amateurs, that is, advanced-level examination subjects, in addition to the subjects examined by the second relative. There is also basic knowledge of vacuum tubes, the characteristics of vacuum tubes, the application of Parameter and crystals, and other aspects such as motors, generators, and internal combustion engines must also be tested. If you want to engage in wireless telephone, you must also test amplitude modulation and knowledge of wireless telephone sets. Amateurs belonging to this level account for about 14% of the country. The wavelengths used are 5 meters, 10 meters, 20 meters, 40 meters, 80 meters, and 160 meters. The antenna power can also be increased to 100 watts. There are also no restrictions on communication time. Moreover, these amateurs also have the right to participate in the national extremely important scientific expeditions to remote areas and to be professors of wireless radio subjects organized by the "Friends of Wireless Radio Association." (To be continued)</p>

<p>Publishing industry</p>
<h3>Shanghai and the Mainland</h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>Shanghai, on the one hand, is an international metropolis where the demonic hands of capitalist imperialism extend into our mainland. Simultaneously, on the other hand, it is the center of our country's political, economic, and publishing circles, occupying a leading position. Due to this characteristic of Shanghai, a deformed existence has been created in our national economy, politics, and culture. That is, the more Shanghai develops and prospers, the more the mainland declines and withers. However, Shanghai ultimately relies on the nourishment of mainland resources to grow. Due to the bankruptcy of the mainland rural economy, Shanghai has finally experienced unprecedented economic recession. This is in terms of the economic relationship between Shanghai and the mainland.</p>
<p>Because of Shanghai's economic advantages, coupled with the protection of imperialist powers, it subtly dominated our mainland not only economically but even politically. The compradores of foreign firms, who were originally high-ranking Chinese, have become our present-day politicians. In the past, it was "study well and become an official"; now, it is "from commerce to officialdom." Those who "excel in learning and become officials" inevitably remain "with clean sleeves," while those who go from commerce to officialdom "accumulate great wealth" as soon as they become officials. This is the commercialization of politics, and also the Shanghai-ization of the Chinese mainland. Such is the influence that Shanghai exerts on our country's politics.</p>
<p>As for culture, in terms of the publishing industry, few can avoid the criticism of being a "pidgin" type. That ancient books are dressed in Western-style bindings has become a trend, let alone how much of the textbooks and periodicals actually represent the national consciousness of China. We really cannot say. In Shanghai, we have "lost China"; in Shanghai's publishing industry, China is also heading towards extinction day by day. However, such a publishing industry is the leader of our country and is being followed step by step by the publishing industry in the mainland. This is worth our attention.</p>
<p>Shanghai's pidgin culture is able to spread to the mainland for several reasons: one is the education provided by drama and film; another is the convenience of transportation and the frequency of contact; and there is also the promotion through publications. Thus, to speak of "modernity," it is imperative to be Shanghai-ized.</p>
<p>In terms of the publishing industry, this superficial imitation is most evident in the disregard for spatial differences. Because Shanghai is at the center of the country, it is natural for its publications to have an international or national character. Conversely, the publications in the mainland, due to their local nature, should be different. However, in reality, mainland publications that discuss current affairs invariably take the *Eastern Miscellany* as their model, and those that discuss literature and art all take the *Short Story Magazine* as their archetype. As a result, not only do mainland publications lose their local distinctiveness, but also in terms of content, they merely resemble the subject, falling far short. What a waste it is in terms of economy, time, and ability!</p>
<p>Recently, I went to Hangzhou and saw a monthly magazine called "Zhejiang Youth," which was able to focus on the history, products, and economy of Zhejiang. I think this editing method is worth recommending to the mainland publishing industry.</p>
<p>(Note) "Zhejiang Youth" is edited and published by the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education.</p>
<h3>Please Ask Hu Shih to Leave the Intellectual World</h3>
<p>— Ye Qing</p>
<p>Hu Shih published an article in the 135th issue of *Independent Critic*, called "A Malady in Today's Intellectual World." After reading it, I felt it necessary to refute it. This is naturally not to defend anyone; I am expressing my opinion.</p>
<p>The fundamental meaning of Hu Shih in this article is to oppose the use of abstract academic terms. He believes that various systems and various ideas "each have a long history, each has its historical evolution, all are concrete things, and cannot be explained, described, or summarized by an abstract term." Therefore, terms such as feudalism, capitalism, and freedom are unusable. If used, it is "misuse of terms," which "creates lazy and general thinking habits in thought; in writing, it creates sonorous and empty stereotyped essays. These are all the remnants of the literary obstacles of China for thousands of years," and "it is not a negligible malady." Today's intellectual world should remove it.</p>
<p>This view completely proves that Hu Shih has not "received a strict intellectual training," and does not even have common sense of logic. We cannot do without common nouns and abstract nouns not only in speaking and writing, but also in understanding. Understanding cannot be separated from concepts, which I explained very clearly in my book *Critique of Zhang Dongsun's Philosophy* (Xin Ken first edition, E419-23, 428-31). Therefore, common nouns and abstract nouns, which express concepts, are indispensable for understanding. The same is true for speaking and writing. Doesn't Hu Shih's article contain many abstract nouns such as "thought," "feudal system," and "liberal culture"?</p>
<p>Our understanding of things progresses from the individual to classification to synthesis. Due to understanding individual things, there are specialized nouns. Due to classifying numerous things, there are common nouns. After recognizing peach trees, plum trees, ..., we want to classify them into one category, naming them "tree," to distinguish them from herbs, woody plants, etc. Proceeding from this, we want to derive a comprehensive noun with the highest concept called "thing." The so-called abstract noun is a common noun in terms of behavior. For example, "capitalism" is the result of classifying various specific economic behaviors. It has a certain content. The so-called generality is relative. And the understanding of behavior also progresses from the individual to classification to synthesis, reaching the highest abstraction.</p>
<p>Human understanding is entirely the mutual explanation of specialized nouns and common nouns, concrete nouns and abstract nouns. If I take an apple and ask Mr. Hu what this is, you will definitely say that an apple is a kind of fruit, round in shape, sweet in taste, .... If I ask what a fruit is, you will definitely say that a fruit is round in shape, sweet in taste, such as an apple. Therefore, the use of nouns cannot be rejected for the explanation of human behavior.</p>
<p>These rules of understanding or expressing understanding are the same regardless of ancient or modern times, Chinese or foreign. Hu Shih does not know them, and should not speak in the intellectual world at all. But he not only does not know that they are indispensable for thought, but instead slanders and falsely accuses them as "literary obstacles of China for thousands of years," isn't it very ridiculous? This view is not only "a major malady in today's intellectual world"; moreover, its publication is really a great shame in today's intellectual world! Mr. Hu, please leave the intellectual world.</p>
<p>Indeed, Hu Shih should withdraw from today's intellectual world. First, he has opposed abstract nouns for a long time. The first time was in 1919 (see his *Collected Writings*, Volume 1, Volume 2, pp. 189-90); the second time was in 1928 (previous book, Volume 3, pp. 91-107). From 1919 to the third time in 1935, there was no progress at all in these seventeen years. Second, I have already criticized the fallacies of the first two times. You can find out by reading my *Critique of Hu Shih* (Xin Ken first edition), pages 681-698, etc. However, today he still wants to repeat the old words without refutation, without showing any consideration for others' criticisms. Isn't this proof of his stubbornness and failure to awaken? What else would such a person do but withdraw from the intellectual world?</p>
<p>Honestly, Hu Shih is a man of the Renaissance era. He only knows Dante, Chaucer's vernacular literature, and Bacon's scientific method. He knows nothing about the things after that. He is confused by terms such as capitalism, imperialism, and socialism. If he wants to criticize, he doesn't understand, so he can only regard it as "name-teaching" to oppose. If it is really that abstract nouns are unnecessary, then why does he still talk about abstract nouns such as empiricism and scientific method? Shouldn't such a knowledge lagger withdraw from the intellectual world?</p>
<p>Of course, I also know that Hu Shih's role has not ended. Although he used the excuse of opposing abstract nouns for capitalism in 1919 to attack the revolutionary ideals (isms) introduced at that time; in 1928, he used the excuse of opposing abstract nouns for imperialism to attack some revolutionary slogans at that time; but in 1935, it is still necessary to use the excuse of opposing abstract nouns for individualist culture to attack socialist terms or methods. In general, as long as the revolution has not succeeded, Hu Shih's counter-revolutionary role will not end. However, we who have the responsibility to promote history should ask him to withdraw from the intellectual world.</p>
<p>Rest, Hu Shih! You do not know the times, and the times do not know you. Get out of the way, do not hinder people's progress!</p>
<h3>Introducing Two Books on Cultural Issues</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuying</p>
<p>*The Study of Culture*, by Xie Songgao, published by the Shanghai Guangxuehui, priced at 50 cents.</p>
<p>*The Theory of Cultural Evolution*, translated by Zhong Zhaolin, published by the World Book Company, priced at 2 yuan.</p>
<p>In the past year, cultural issues in China have truly risen like a storm, attracting special attention. All scholars, writers, and even professors of all sizes, if they don't say a few words about culture, long or short, when they meet people, it seems like they are a bit behind the times, lacking fashion. Of course, loving to talk about culture is not a bad thing, but holding shallow, timely ideas to talk nonsense is harmful.</p>
<p>Since cultural issues have attracted attention, some people have advocated the establishment of "cultural studies," which is indeed an urgent task. Because if cultural issues are not quickly established into a scientific system, researchers will always feel at a loss and unable to start. If cultural issues can produce a science, research can have a certain system and method. However, the research on cultural issues in China is still very immature. Although there are many people who talk about cultural issues, I am afraid that half of the content is irrelevant, and the other half is mutually similar, trivial, and repetitive, which is better not to talk about.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to present two books to recommend to gentlemen who are enthusiastic about studying cultural issues. One is "The Theory of Cultural Evolution" translated by Zhong Zhaolin, and the other is "The Study of Culture" written by Xie Songgao. Although these two books cannot be said to be perfect works of cultural science, they can be said to be a sweet rain in the drought when cultural issues are urgently discussed, but no special works can be found. As far as the reporter has seen, there are really many books such as *History of Eastern Culture*, *History of Western Culture*, and *Small History of Culture*. It is not difficult to find one or twenty kinds at a time. But these histories are all subjective narratives, and I absolutely do not come up with a reasonable common standard. I think perhaps only these two books can maintain a scientific spirit and conduct universal and in-depth research on cultural issues.</p>
<p>The book "The Study of Culture" is most convenient for those who study cultural issues for the first time to read. It goes from shallow to deep, and the sentences are very simple and clear, easy to read, and easy to understand. The whole book is divided into two volumes, the first volume is "The Development of Culture," and the second volume is "The Discussion of Culture." The first volume discusses the development of cultural phenomena and its relationship with various social organizations, scientific evolution, etc. in the development process. The second volume discusses the current and general cultural issues in China.</p>
<p>In the preface, the author of "The Theory of Cultural Evolution" said that this is the outline proposed in the university's lecture notes on "Cultural Anthropology," and the materials are very rich. If we have a preliminary study of cultural issues, for example, if we have read the book "The Study of Culture" and want to do a deeper study, then reading this book is the most suitable thing.</p>

<h3>Finance, Gold Market Peaceful, Limited Trading, Daily Fluctuation of 3.30 Yuan, Resulting in a Rise of 3.10 Yuan, Swap Transactions Quite Favorable for the Long Side</h3>
<p>The gold market was relatively stable yesterday due to the slight contraction of overseas silver markets and popular disappointment. Market conditions during the day were quiet and idle due to the expiration of swap transactions and the inactivity of major players, with only a 3.30 yuan fluctuation and extremely limited trading. In the early morning, the overseas silver market was stable with the British market flat and the American market contracted. The forward silver price in Montrelay rose slightly and fell more. Exchange rates rose slightly, and the London gold price rose by one penny, and sentiment seemed slightly disappointed and turned stable. When the over-the-counter pre-market trading opened, it immediately rose to 74.5 yuan. Selling activity took advantage of the high price, because Reuters reported that the U.S. Treasury Secretary denied reports of reducing or changing foreign silver purchase policies. It then fell to 72.3 yuan and then hovered. The Central Bank's official listing was announced, and both the British and American markets were flat. The Customs Gold Unit rose by one li, and the standard gold price was listed at 835.5 yuan, slightly improving. The morning opened high, and major players rushed to buy gold bars after the opening, and it rose. Banks' appetites were full, and hedging activities fueled selling pressure. Soon it fell again, but sentiment remained stable, and there was still support at the low price. HSBC's official listing for British and American markets was also flat, trending up after the low price. Later, buyers rushed in again, and it rose again. However, the foreign exchange market was normal, and banks came out to sell again, resulting in abundant supply. It went high and then returned, but trading was scattered, lacking special fluctuations. Finally, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the market became boring, with narrower fluctuations. Because of the hot weather, the agents' request to shorten afternoon business hours was not approved. In addition, the trading was originally light, so there was a lack of buyers in the market, and it was not opened until 2:40 p.m., which was still stable. After the opening, the price fell due to the Indian silver report rising two annas and Sassoon selling sterling, Hengchangyong selling bars vigorously, but there were few buyers in a state of idleness. At 10:00 a.m. tomorrow, the July-August swap transaction will be held, and the premium is expected to be about 3-4 yuan on the long side. The market conditions for the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 773.7 yuan, up 2.5 yuan from the previous close, then 3.5 yuan. Qingfa, Yongwanfeng, Jinlong, Futai, Yongheng, Yu Dada, and Chenglaijin rose to 5.8 yuan. Zhengjin sold July sterling at 6875, Macgary sold July US dollars at 4375, Dada, Chengwanzhang, Jiarunhengyu, and Chunyuanyonghengxing were late sellers, down to 3.6 yuan. It was learned that HSBC's official listing for British and American markets was flat and stable. Yingxiang, Shunli, Fuxingyong, Yongli, Fusheng Yonghouchangyong Lianmei bought in, rising to 6.3 yuan. Fu and Yonghengyu Dada, Dafa, Yongyifeng and Tongyi sold together, because the foreign exchange market was normal. Macgary Huabi still sold July US dollars at 4375, falling to 4.6 yuan. Yuanmao Yongyongli Hengyu bought bars, Macgary pa August US dollars at 125, rising to 5.9 yuan. Overseas Chinese Huabi sold July US dollars at 4375 again, Dada Cheng Houchangyong supplied bars, falling to the nominal 6 yuan. Hengyu Chunyuanyong and others still maintained, rising again to 6 yuan. At this time, Yuanmao Yongfuxingyong Deli had a selling intention and it was difficult to rise further. The noon close was 775.5 yuan, and it was slightly tired after the close.</p>
<p>The opening price of Houpei was 775.5 yuan (the trading in the market was light, and the agents did not reach out and shout, and the opening was delayed until 2:40 pm). The Indian silver report was large, 2.2.1 annas, and Huixiang, Richang, Tongtaichang, Houchangyong and Tongyi sold, falling to 4.1 yuan. Deli and others still made long positions, but later Sassoon came out to sell sterling July 6875 Hengchang Yong vigorously cut long positions, and Jinlong and others also sold, falling to 3 yuan. There are many buyers at this price, and it can still support it. Fuyu Dada Cheng Hengyu Laijin rose to 4.3 yuan, Hengchang Yong Richang still sold, falling to 3.7 yuan. The rise of 2.1 annas had no impact. The closing price was 774.3 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 776.3 yuan and the lowest price was 773 yuan, with a fluctuation of 3.3 yuan. As a result, it rose 3.1 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 835.5 yuan, with the standard price of gold from the Central Bank listed, and the closing price was about 61 yuan, less than 2 yuan from the previous close. July's dengzhang was 776 yuan, with the water replenishment in the morning at 771 yuan and the water replenishment in the afternoon at 772 yuan. The price of red gold was about 12 yuan, at 785.7 yuan. The spot market conditions were flat, with melted red gold being sold to the silver shop gang by Yingfeng Hengda Fengheng at an added price of 19 yuan, about 400 taels of Tianjin goods, and the selling price needed 18 yuan, but the transaction was not concluded. The prior forecast for the current July-August swap period was that the long side would have benefits, but a part of the melted red gold transaction cannot be used as a support. Recently, the melted red gold has been tired. The spot price for the July period is about 5-6 yuan on the short side. The silver root is still very tight. The current premium may not be overly raised. Generally, it is about 3-4 yuan on the long side. The trend will depend on the lineup and strength of both sides.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was extremely scattered. In summary, Hengchang Yongyuan Mao Yongfuxingyong Dada Cheng Richang Lifeng Shunmao Deli Hongxing Jiarun Fuyu and others were on the selling side, and Shunli Yifeng Yongtong Taichang Fuan Zhengchang Jiatai Futai Yongyuan Kangxiang Dafa Yongjinlong Dada Chang Dayuan Heng Chunyuanyong Hengyu and others were on the buying side. Yifeng Yong Chunyuanyong Richang advanced first and then retreated. Dada Cheng Yuanmao Yongyicheng first exited and then entered. The Dalian gang Wanxing made more than 500 yuan and squeezed out about 200 yuan. Shunli made a total of more than 1,000 yuan and squeezed in more than 100 yuan. The Guang gang Shengshengda Hengxing had little difference. The July period has 14,721 chips, with a total of 46 long parties and 51 short parties. The total number of transactions was 17,577 in the morning and 6,069 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Banks Selling, Foreign Exchange Market Flat Both Officially and Unofficially</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign news, London's large strips were flat, both near and far. New York's silver price contracted by 25, Montrelay's forward silver market rose by 5 hao and fell by 2.5 li. London's gold price rose by one penny, the British exchange rate against the US rose by 625, the French exchange rate against the British rose by 28 pounds, the US exchange rate against the British rose by 375, and the US exchange rate against the French contracted by 25. The recent selling price opened in the morning foreign exchange market, with the British exchange rate at one shilling seven pence 875 and the US exchange rate at 0 yuan 9375, which was slightly tight compared to the previous close for both British and American exchange rates. The Central Bank's official listing was announced, and both the British and American markets were flat, with the Customs Gold Unit rising by one li. Sentiment was stable, but it tended to be loose after the opening because banks were selling. HSBC's official listing announcement showed that both the British and American markets were flat, and the Chinese merchants' psychology was prosperous and still had a buying appetite, which was able to maintain the price. However, banks were quite willing to sell, and the process was stable throughout. The final transaction was idle, resulting in an even more lacking special change and extremely sluggish market. The late market still opened flat, with a potential trend towards loosening. Later, when the Indian silver report rose by 1.2 annas, it slightly loosened. Thereafter, Macgary and Sassoon both had a selling appetite, but the transaction was still small, and it soon became sluggish again. Finally, the Indian silver report fluctuated slightly by one anna back and forth and rose by 2.1 annas, and the process had become quiet. By the closing selling price in the recent period, the British exchange rate was paired with one shilling seven pence 875 and 9375, and the US exchange rate was 41 yuan. Compared to the previous close, both the British and American exchange rates had no change, and the Chinese merchants slightly bought in, and the banks also had a selling appetite, and Sassoon slightly threw sterling. The day's transaction is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The British exchange rate opened in the morning with a recent selling price of one shilling ten pence 875. Youli sold to Huabi July at 6875, Mitsubishi sold August at 5625, Zhengjin sold July at 6875, Youli Great Britain sold at the same price in the same month, HSBC sold June at 875, and July at 6875. Citibank sold to Huabi at the same price in the same month. The noon close was a recent selling price of one shilling seven pence 875. Macgary ate August at 5625 in the late market, Macgary sold to overseas Chinese July at 6875, and Sassoon Macgary sold to Jincheng at the same price in the same month. The closing selling price was a spot price of one shilling seven pence 875 and 9375, June at 875, July at 6875, August at half a penny, and September at 375, with the purchase price added at zero 0625.</p>
<p>The US exchange rate opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 40 yuan 9375, HSBC sold June at 875, Macgary sold July at 43175, and Huabi Macgary sold at the same price in the same month.

The closing selling price was a spot price of 41 yuan, June at 40 yuan 9375, July at half a yuan, August at 125, and September at 39 yuan 875, with the purchase price added at zero 0625.</p>
<p>After Centralized Collection and Disbursement, Interest Rates Settle Down Slightly — Corner of the Market Recovers … Copper Coins Continue Short —</p>
<p>Recently, due to the establishment of centralized exchange transfers in the silver dollar market, the general public has shifted its focus to the money shop reserve and clearing house. This has led to a sluggish market situation. Once the merger is completed, various market practices will inevitably be eliminated, which will greatly contribute to the consolidation of finance. Yesterday, the overnight interest rate remained unchanged at 18 cents per tael. Due to the impact of centralized collection and disbursement, the premium for cash transfers has gradually declined, opening at 50 cents and then changing to 60 cents, both lower than the previous day by 10 cents. For interbank draft transactions, morning trading reached over 1.5 million taels, with new transactions exceeding 200,000 taels. There were no transactions in the afternoon. Transactions in the Small General Association amounted to over 600,000 taels. Silver pawn transactions saw 400,000 taels redeemed and 200,000 taels in new pledges. For banknote transactions, over 700,000 taels were recovered, with over 500,000 taels of circulating notes issued and over 300,000 taels in secret-mark notes. Remittances from various routes totaled over 300,000 taels, incoming funds from other regions amounted to 200,000 taels, and outgoing funds were over 300,000 taels. Regarding bank clearing, foreign banks cleared over 1.6 million taels in drafts, over 2.3 million taels in various commodity-backed and miscellaneous funds, over 400,000 taels in special funds, and over 600,000 taels in foreign exchange funds. was 400,000 taels. Chinese banks cleared over 1.6 million taels in drafts, over 2.7 million taels in various commodity-backed and miscellaneous funds, over 600,000 taels in special remittances, over 800,000 taels in foreign exchange settlements, and 200,000 taels were placed in storage. Japanese banks cleared over 1.5 million taels in drafts, over 2.4 million taels in various commodity-backed and miscellaneous funds, over 600,000 taels in special remittances, over 500,000 taels in foreign exchange settlements, and 600,000 taels were released from storage. Money shops cleared over 12.2 million taels in silver dollars, over 4.2 million taels in silver dollar transfer funds, and combined cash clearing...</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Jiangnan small silver dollars remained at 827.50 yuan in both morning and afternoon markets, unchanged from the previous day, with no reported transactions. The price of Guangdong small silver dollars fell by 20 cents in the morning market to 735.20 yuan but recovered by 1.30 yuan in the afternoon market to 736.50 yuan, resulting in a net increase of 1.10 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions amounted to 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were priced at 336,500 cash, a decrease of 500 cash compared to the previous day, with a transaction volume of 37,015 strings of cash, equivalent to 11,000 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total amount exchanged at the local clearing house on the 14th was 7,218,520.53 silver dollars, 1,202,372.37 silver dollars, and 3,194,800.16 silver dollars in exchange transfers.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Waver, with Differing Trends Before and After</h3>
<p>Government bond prices have fluctuated in recent days entirely due to the tightening and loosening of the situation in Hebei. Yesterday, the market initially saw a renewed sharp decline due to the tightening situation, but then rebounded due to short covering. The chaos and anxiety caused by the fluctuations throughout the day are evident. Looking at the market trends in recent days, prices have repeatedly risen and fallen, with small recoveries after large declines, ultimately falling further than before, indicating market pressure. Furthermore, this decline in bond prices has not been substantial. While some market participants previously held optimistic views, they have now unanimously turned bearish. It is also reported that a certain financial institution that took delivery last month has completely liquidated its positions this month. Therefore, with an oversupply of securities, there is little room for optimism. Yesterday's activity saw prices rise at the opening except for the reorganization bonds, which were pulled up to par. The demobilization bonds immediately showed weakness, with strong selling pressure from various groups, with significant volumes traded at 18.32. Prices of salt tax and gold short bonds fell sharply by one yuan. Later, the market eased slightly, with prices rising by 7-8 cents due to absorption by 35, 21, and 54 bonds. The afternoon session saw the demobilization bonds rise by one yuan, but only gained a few cents after that, due to negative news in the evening papers, causing investor sentiment to weaken. In summary, the market moved in opposite directions before and after. Reorganization bonds rose by as much as 1.5 yuan, while salt tax bonds fell by about one yuan. The total transaction volume was 19,035,000 yuan. The high and low prices are listed in the comparison table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Firm</h3>
<p>According to a report from the New Feng Foreign Firm, yesterday (the 13th) the New York stock market saw light trading with mixed but firm prices. The sharp decline in wheat and the uncertainty of legislation had a negative impact on the market, but this was offset by continuous investment demand. Small exchange stocks rose slightly under the leadership of special stocks. The bond market was mixed with a slight softening. The total daily trading volume was 860,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: After Days of Sharp Declines, the Yarn Market Enters a Period of Calm; Chinese and Foreign Yarn Merchants Have Different Views on Future Prices</h3>
<p>After days of sharp declines in the yarn market, prices are now showing signs of stabilizing, and the market is extremely quiet. However, foreign merchants continue to sell, and the volume of sales is increasing. It is estimated that in the past five days, an average of over 10,000 bales have been sold per session, putting significant pressure on the market. However, some traders are buying on dips as their inventories are depleted.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster and Changfeng Bales Sold Continuously: In the futures market, the market was calm in all months, unlike the previous day's frenzy. Due to the easing of news from North China, new buyers were also taking a wait-and-see approach. Only sporadic retail investors covered their short positions, with prices for each month rising slightly by 1-3 cents compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, retail investors were extremely optimistic, with prices rising by 1-3 cents in all months. However, foreign merchants resumed selling, with Changfeng selling approximately 2,000 bales. As a result, prices softened again by the third closing. Spot transactions were sluggish. According to another report, a certain factory still has 500 bales to deliver this month. As a result, prices for each month fell by 2-7 cents compared to the morning session. It is reported that 600 bales of Yudda, 400 bales of Chonglong, 1,250 bales of Ruida, 900 bales of Run Kang, 600 bales of Changyu, and 2,250 bales of Changfeng were sold. 800 bales of Dafu, 1,150 bales of Tongji, 1,450 bales of Jun Chang, 550 bales of Xincheng, 500 bales of Renfeng, and 350 bales of Yi Chang were purchased. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Fall Short of 400 Bundles: Spot yarn sales remain sluggish. Statistics show that a total of 333 bales were purchased by various groups throughout the day, with prices remaining flat. The purchase volume by each group is listed below: Mainland: 55 Guangdong: 260 Jiangxi: 8 North Group: 20</p>
<h3>Climate: Drought Kills a Bit of the Cotton Decline</h3>
<p>After the cotton market's decline, stability rumors spread, especially for July deliveries. However, daily shipments decrease and a rally is possible. Recent dry climate has affected cotton growth, stabilizing prices despite ordinary US cotton news.</p>
<p>Recent Cotton Sellers Thin Out: In the futures market, months saw a slight increase. Market rumors claimed a cotton firm reversed from short to long, taking delivery in the near month and planning to take 20,000 dan in July, hedging with 80-month contracts. This heavy air reduced sellers despite weaker US and Indian cotton markets. Resulting months rose 5 cents from the previous day's close. Afternoon trading showed flatness due to abundant Shanghai spot cotton, though dry weather hit new cotton development. Near months fell 5 cents from the morning close, distant was flat. Sincere sold 1,000 dan, Suilong 3,500 dan, Yuanda 2,100 dan, Shenchang 1,700 dan, Shenji 4,300 dan, Run Kang 2,500 dan, Changhe 1,800 dan, Yikang 1,800 dan, Ruiyuan 1,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,100 dan. Run Kang bought 2,000 dan, Tongji 1,200 dan, Yuan 1,1,300 dan, Changfeng 1,500 dan, Tonghe 5,000 dan, Yifeng 1,500 dan, Yifeng 2,900 dan, Gengfeng 1,300 dan, Junchang 2,300 dan. High, low, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Shenxin Purchases Lingbao Cotton: Spot cotton sales are scarce, with weak factory intake. Shenxin's intake is good, sourcing 1,142 bales of Yao cotton and 100 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton: 42.50 Shenxin Factory Intake 250 pieces of spot goods sent to factory.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton: 42.25 Xinyu Factory Intake 82 pieces of spot goods sent to factory.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton: 42.50</p>
<h3>Times Change: Japanese Yarn to be Re-Listed as Standard; Resumption After a Seven-Year Hiatus!</h3>
<p>The local Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange originally had Japanese yarn standard grades. After the Jinan Incident in 1928, only Chinese yarn was auctioned. According to market rumors (December 12), starting in January 1936, Japanese yarn will be re-listed as a grade to show goodwill. Because Japanese yarn is very active in the market and now is deliverable, its momentum will increase. The future market fluctuations will be unprecedented. Chinese yarn businesses will face more challenges.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Traders Await Developments in Washington</h3>
<p>US cotton opened with a dull market. Prices fell 3-5 points due to poor Liverpool news, grain weakness, poor textile demand, July positions closing, and broker selling. Prices recovered on dip buying and Texas rains. Traders await Washington developments. Speculative buying decreased. Short covering firmed prices at the close. Spot unchanged, futures rose 2-4 points. UK spot fell 5 points, futures 7-8 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to speculator and European exporter selling, but recovered on dip buying. Spot Pragol unchanged, Oomra fell half a rupee, White Rose unchanged. Tele record left (December 13)</p>
<p>Pragol 143.50 Flat 18.50</p>
<p>December/January 138.25 Flat 17.80</p>
<p>Oomra 207.00 Fell 0.50 26.70 Dec/Jan 189.75 0.50 24.40</p>
<p>White Rose 228.75 Flat 29.60</p>
<p>April/May Rich 212.50 Flat 27.50</p>
<p>Mumbai also forecasts Apr/May White Rose cotton opening at 212 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous close. Wheat up 5-6 cents, barley up 1.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Grains: No Rain, Flour and Wheat Rise Again</h3>
<p>The flour market saw an initial calm yesterday, followed by a gradual and sharp rise. Using foreign prices, Chicago fell 5-6 cents, Canadian barley fell 12 cents. At the opening, with foreign wheat falling for three consecutive days, market sentiment was weak. Prices fell 1-2 cents in the near term. After this, prices gradually rose sharply due to concerns about the silver problem, with mills hesitant to place orders. Since summer, there has been a prolonged drought. Now in the mold season, the sun is blazing, with no rain. People are worried that last year's severe drought will repeat. Buying interest increased inside and outside the industry, defying expectations. In the afternoon, sentiment strengthened. Opening prices rose 2-3 cents. The near month stabilized. Distant months saw selling by Tang groups and buying by Tianjin groups. Internal clients still eagerly bought. Market sentiment remained high. If rain comes, the pressure may ease, otherwise sentiment will remain tight. The near month rose by 7.75 cents, July by 7.75 cents, August by 6.25 cents, September by 6.5 cents, October by 5.5 cents, November by 5.25 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market saw rising prices after opening because Jiangnan has suffered from prolonged drought, with the past drought still a fresh memory. Market and industry were fearful. So prices soared following the opening, but due to tight money, factual needs were flat. The rise was purely psychological. Afternoon saw further sharp rises and lively trading, up 5-6 cents from the morning. The conditions were driven by prolonged drought. If rains return, the boom could fade. July rose 12 cents, August 12 cents, September 1.5 cents, October 12 cents. Spot wheat was up 2-3 cents on futures, but factory intake was ordinary due to nearly 10,000 arriving bags, so gains were low. Chuzhou opened at 3.45 yuan, Jiangxinzhou 3.50 yuan, Zhenjiang 3.37 yuan, next 3 yuan, Yangzhou Puzhen 3.38 yuan, Nanjing Taiping 3.36 yuan, Anting 3.22 yuan, Taicang 3.29 yuan, next 3.25 yuan, Kunyou 3.35 yuan, next 3 yuan, Bacheng 3.35 yuan, Wusong 3.25 yuan, next 3.2 yuan. Fuxin shipped 3,300 bags, Xinda 1,500, Fufeng 300.</p>
<p>Overseas markets may soon see a reaction, but the overall trend remains down. Factory markets are weak. Canada's remaining wheat is about 235 million bushels. Crop conditions are excellent.</p>
<h3>Rice Paddies Suffer from Drought: Du Geng and Foreign Rice Sell Well at Higher Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local rice (Shanghai South) market saw 26 boatloads (totaling over 5,000 piculs). Due to prolonged dry weather hindering agriculture, local sentiment turned positive and the market tightened. High-quality Keng rice varieties like Suzhou and Tong Keng rose sharply by 2-3 dimes, while Nangang early rice also increased by 1.5-2 dimes. Only late rice saw limited gains due to stagnant buying interest. Shady Yuan also rose slightly. Du Jian remained ordinary. (Shanghai North) 13 boatloads arrived at the He Xia market. Early morning saw quiet for the various buyers. Afternoon saw better buying and prices rose several cents to 1 dime. Early, thin rice sold well and the better grades were also viable, but mid-grade rice lingered. Good qualities pushed prices upward and middling qualities were flat. White Yuan and other colors of rice showed neither gains nor losses.</p>
<p>Foreign rice prices were quite active. Due to continued buying by local buyers, the Shanghai-Ningbo railway, and the Yangtze River area, the dry weather in the Jiangzhe area has created panic and buyers fear a repeat of last year's drought. Saigon rice saw the strongest consumption. The whole city opened 15,000 bags of No. 1 rice, 10,000 bags of No. 3 rice. 650 tons of No. 13 re-lending goods traded, 7,000 bags of Xiaojiao opened. Siamese and Annam Gaogong rice also saw about 2,000 bags traded. In total, about 40,000 bags traded. Heavy trade pushed prices higher in the face of tight money and political unrest. Yesterday rice prices rose from a dime to as much as 6 cents.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Gradually Expanding</h3>
<p>The local, quiet silk market is now gradually expanding. New York operators have also been quiet for a long time and now have intent to move. Recently, the US and Europe have seen activity. If exchange rates stabilize, the silk market could return to prosperity.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Orchid Rice Has Clean Quality</h3>
<p>New batch of orchid rice will be arriving this month. In the past, incoming goods were criticized for impurities, due to harvesting on sandy ground, so sand and dirt were mixed in after drying. Some merchants did not screen the rice and even added sand, lowering the quality. Shipping and taxes were wasted on sand weight. Therefore, local merchants repeatedly advised improving the processing. Now, the firm promises to screen the sand in the new batch, for better sales. So the first shipment will be of good quality, but the cost will be slightly higher.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Large Mǎkǒu Tinplate Very Scarce</h3>
<p>Lately, 24-28 gauge large Mǎkǒu tinplate has been in short supply. Yarn factories and toy factories need it greatly, so there is not enough to go around. Incoming goods are poor and volumes are low. The price for 24 gauge is estimated at 65 yuan, and 28 gauge sells for 52 yuan. It is reported that 340 cases opened. Merchants along Broadway Road have been buying, so prospects are good.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Chen Yunsu)</p>
<p>Those running around in the education circle, rushing about in a flurry, look at everything outside the circle as if it were a different world, wishing they could break free from this cage and experience it firsthand. However, those outside the education circle, seeing the splendor, brilliance, and strangeness within the circle, feel that its flavor is indescribable. It would be best to mingle a bit, listen to the professors' lofty pronouncements that resound to the heavens, and then return to their hometowns to impress their country bumpkin comrades.</p>
<p>When a woman has no rivals, she feels that her lover is like the fire of life, indispensable for a day, and she can't wait to break free from the guardianship of her parents to live a sweet and intimate life with her beloved. Who knew that as love matures and she is about to wear her wedding dress, she feels that leaving her parents, with whom she has spent her entire life, to be with her lover is a bit too selfish. But if she doesn't go, she feels that it's too... This is a real dilemma!</p>
<h3>Early Summer Night</h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Although it is early summer, the evenings still carry some of the climate of late spring; walking outside in a thin silk dress still makes people shiver.</p>
<p>It was a Saturday night; Wei, Hao, and You came to my place to ask me to go to the Bund Park to talk, and they even bought a box of Cantonese dim sum from a nearby Cantonese shop, which they planned to eat in the park.</p>
<p>Three uneven shadows swayed under the dim streetlights, and a trace of joy temporarily appeared on each pale face, covered with the melancholy of life.</p>
<p>As if they were ghosts, dragging their heavy limbs, they walked along the North Suzhou Creek; but the surroundings were so quiet, the entire hustle and bustle seemed to have fallen into dead silence. —We also forgot that we were still in that prosperous metropolis, and no one said a word, letting that hateful loneliness dominate our space—</p>
<p>There were not many visitors in the park, but in a few shady spots under the trees, people were staging various disgusting scenes. However, we didn't pay attention to these and just sat down on a row of benches by the river.</p>
<p>A crescent moon quietly hid overhead, as if spying on the secrets hidden in each of our hearts; countless stars surrounded it, playfully reflecting in our eyes. Electric torches sparkled in the darkness, neon lights drew arcs on the three-dimensional buildings, and the small steamers in the Huangpu River roared with sharp, strange cries; it shocked my heart, and made my soul tremble...</p>
<p>The chimes of the Customs House drifted to our side, breaking through our boundless depression. Wei opened the box and took out the dim sum, and everyone ate it without restraint, throwing the momentary pain into the Huangpu River, letting the waves wash it into the vast ocean, never to return. I felt like a child again, regaining the innocence of childhood, and filled with the love of friendship!</p>
<p>—Ah! This great, supreme friendship!</p>
<p>Outside the park, after shaking hands and saying goodbye, we each stepped onto the streets of the early summer night and walked back to our respective residences.</p>
<h3>Two Faces</h3>
<p>— Nanhai Seagull</p>
<p>Ah Q's neighbor, Ah Nu, accused him of having two faces (Double-faced Diplomacy). It turned out that Ah Q was having a bad year, having suffered several serious illnesses, leaving him weak. His family was also in a state of disrepair, having spent everything. All that remained was an old purple copper incense burner passed down from his ancestors, a gnarled arhat pine planted in the courtyard, and two and a half mu of non-grain land near his house, which he stubbornly refused to sell.</p>
<p>Ah Nu's family was nouveau riche, who had always exploited others by lending money at exorbitant interest rates, and insisted that Ah Q do everything according to his wishes. His servants also constantly looked for trouble with Ah Q. Ah Q knew he was not strong enough, and after being slapped by him in the past, he had to return the favor, shouting for others to say a fair word. Later, after repeated failures, he didn't even dare to look him in the eye, and didn't even dare to hum.</p>
<p>"A wise man doesn't fight when the odds are against him." This was Ah Q's reassurance. So when he saw Ah Nu's servants, and even a little yellow dog, he had to show a very friendly attitude to avoid causing trouble. But Ah Q, after turning around, couldn't help but be upset. Walking inside, talking and chatting with his sons, he couldn't help but feel angry. His sons didn't understand things and glared at the evil neighbor, spitting, which was unavoidable. If Ah Nu's family saw or heard it, they would come to roar again.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Ah Q's sheep was beaten to death on the corner of Ah Nu's field. This field corner had originally been occupied by Ah Q. Ah Nu found a big issue and said, "Good for you! You are always two-faced with me. My family is doing well, and you come and beat my sheep to death on my field corner, bringing me bad luck. Now you have to cut down the arhat pine in your house, sell me the two and a half mu of non-grain land, and offer up the purple copper incense burner to appease my spirits!"</p>
<p>"It turned out that Ah Nu had a capable family servant, one playing the red face, specializing in intimidating Ah Q; the other playing the white face, specializing in coaxing. Using both soft and hard tactics, with a balance of strength and gentleness. This is truly a two-faced diplomatic tactic, how could Ah Q not be confused and out of control!"</p>
<h3>The Oppressed Nation</h3>
<p>— Shiying</p>
<h3>Drifting Fragrance of Royal Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>It has nothing that can be wasted. Its old roots, stems, and leaves are all very important in Chinese medicine; especially its leaves, which are as clean as white paper when first picked. People often use them to wrap cooked food. And its petals and more tender roots—that is, lotus roots—are the most elegant food in summer.”</p>
<p>Then she ordered Zhang De to tell the lotus growers to immediately pull out a few fresh and tender lotus roots, wash them on the spot, and cut them into slices to chew; we on the royal boat also enjoyed a taste of the emperor's delicacy thanks to her old age. Everyone couldn't help but feel secretly happy; in fact, the taste of fresh lotus root is good, but it's not something rare, and everyone has eaten their fill of it. But today, the lotus root we were eating was bestowed by the Empress Dowager, so it seemed particularly delicious. We were eating fresh lotus roots while watching the small eunuchs in short blue jackets jumping up and down transplanting new lotuses, and we circled the entire lake without realizing it. At that time, the sun had not yet reached its zenith!</p>
<p>"Now, it's about time!" After the Empress Dowager instructed Li Lianying to take out his watch to check the time, she ordered, "We don't need to circle anymore," move the boat to the center of the lake, moor it steadily there, and we'll make plans after we've had lunch!</p>
<p>As soon as she said this, the boat immediately turned its direction and slowly, steadily, rocked towards the center of the lake. When it was almost in the center, the Empress Dowager issued the order to stop the boat; there were generally two iron anchors prepared on this royal boat, and at this moment they were lowered into the water together, and the boat stopped following them. All one could hear was the surrounding lake water gently washing against the bottom of the boat, making a rumbling sound. The Empress Dowager didn't find it objectionable, but after seeing that the boat had stopped steadily, she didn't say anything else. (340)</p>
<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Fourteenth Episode: A Unique Enlightenment: A Westerner Discusses Construction, Not Without Regret; A Poor Scholar Plants Seeds of Longing</p>
<p>"The student who comes here to study, he's like a toad lusting after swan meat, he's taken a fancy to her. Every afternoon around five or six o'clock, he sneaks out to this alley behind the gate, pacing back and forth." Zhiqian said, "Maybe he has other business pacing back and forth in that alley?" The teahouse attendant smiled and said, "This alley, it's just a few poor families living here, what business could there be? And that Zhu family girl, she's also secretly sending wireless telegraphs to him." Zhiqian said sternly, "Don't talk nonsense anymore. This girl is from an old-fashioned family, forced to sell her face at Little West Heaven just to make a living. In truth, she's not a vulgar person." The teahouse attendant knew that Master Cheng liked the Zhu family girl, and that he was getting a little angry, so he kept quiet and left Zhiqian's room. Zhiqian thought to himself, "Could it really be that the girl is so quick to change her attitude?" He pondered, pacing back and forth in his own room. He nodded, then shook his head, making a fuss to himself for a while, and it was already five o'clock. He looked out the window at the sky, and couldn't help but pace out of his room, heading towards the back gate of Little West Heaven. The two small white wooden doors were only half-closed. Zhiqian held the door, slowly poked his head out, and looked outside, only to see Wang Beihai with his hands in his pockets, head down, pacing step by step in the alley. He walked from east to west. He walked so quietly, and there was no movement from Hu's wife's courtyard across the street. (240)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Notes</p>
<h3>Original Pawned Goods</h3>
<p>— Pillow Green</p>
<p>My ancestors ran a clothing business in a rural town for fifty years. The customers of the clothing store were mostly rural men and women, and most of them knew that the clothing in the store was divided into "original pawned goods" and "newly made goods," and they liked to specify that they wanted to buy "original pawned goods."</p>
<p>Originally, the source of a large amount of clothing in the store was items that had been pawned and not redeemed. Twice a year, they were packed into bundles as large as cartwheels. Regardless of whether the goods were new or old, good or bad, they had to be bought all at once. The store's buyer would go through each item, mark the price, and display it on the shelves for sale: these were the so-called "original pawned goods."</p>
<p>Original pawned goods came in various materials and sizes, providing customers with choices to find suitable items. Even if there were slight differences in size, the thrifty villagers were not too picky. They felt that the only advantage was that the original pawned goods had meticulous stitching and durable materials: all of this was due to the original owner's careful management, and they were definitely not willing to be somewhat vague in case of the misfortune of being pawned and unredeemed. It can be asserted that each piece of original pawned goods had a mark from the pawning process, hidden in an inconspicuous corner, which experienced clothing store customers could identify and trust. Indeed, new clothing was mass-produced for the market, with wages calculated per piece, so the cutting and sewing were inevitably more hasty, and they were not as popular with agents, even though they might be durable and stylish.</p>
<p>However, new clothing bought from the store often ended up being pawned halfway through, and then returned to the clothing store, where they uniformly acquired the qualification of "original pawned goods"—with the mark made by the pawnshop serving as a powerful talisman! They were easier to sell than new clothes that had never been worn or pawned! Sometimes, a piece of original pawned goods would be sold from the store's counter, pawned at the pawnshop's counter, and then returned to the store's shelves; in this way, a well-made, carefully selected, and custom-made piece of clothing, some of which had never even been worn, would be ravaged by multiple procedures and eroded by years of weather, becoming unusable, but still trusted by those who loved to buy original pawned goods, who were willing to pay a price slightly lower than the original cost of custom-making it. Here, there is an interesting analogy: the new goods reincarnated as original pawned goods are like a group of young people who are good at speculation, while the original pawned goods that have returned several times are like a group of local old gentry who repeatedly fall and rise, like roly-poly toys!</p>
<p>Original pawned goods have a special charm that other goods do not have, which is that among thousands of pieces, no two are exactly the same, and each piece always has some trace of the past. If someone with sufficient qualifications and interest in the clothing business were to conduct a detailed investigation and exploration, they would definitely be able to learn about the personality, habits, circumstances, and actions of the original owner(s)—or multiple owners—of the original pawned goods, and even infer the state of a family or a period of society.</p>
<p>Original pawned goods are not limited to clothing (of course, the majority of goods pawned and unredeemed are still clothing), but also include ornaments, bronze and tinware, etc., which are bought along with each batch of unredeemed goods by the clothing store, and the best-selling items or those suitable for the local area are selected and sold in the store's shop, while the unwanted items are sold to silver and copper/tin shops, etc., to avoid trouble. People familiar with this situation will go to the clothing store to ask for the items they need, and often find bargains. Nowadays, there are sales shops in bustling areas of Shanghai with luxurious decorations. Some of the gold, silver, jewelry, diamonds, and watches they sell are also original pawned goods from pawnshops.</p>

<h3>The Eradication of Bedbugs Campaign</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>As soon as summer arrives, bedbugs will come out for major activities again.</p>
<p>Whether there are bedbugs in foreign countries is unknown. But judging from the Japanese calling bedbugs "Nanjing bugs," it seems that bedbugs are unique to China.</p>
<p>Summer is truly a world of bedbugs. As soon as night falls, they swarm around on the beds. They not only disturb your sleep, but also suck your blood until you cry out in pain. However, although people hate them, they are helpless against them because they cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>Now, someone has launched a campaign to eradicate bedbugs. The initiators are several members of the Public Health Research Association. They are well aware of the suffering of ordinary people from bedbugs, and that people in society do not pay much attention to this issue. Therefore, they have launched this campaign this summer to relieve the suffering of ordinary people. The first step in their campaign is to launch a "Bedbug Life Research" essay competition to arouse the attention of biological researchers across the country to this issue. Although this campaign is very unique, it is very meaningful.</p>
<p>First, the purpose of their campaign is to relieve the suffering of ordinary people from sleep, which is very commendable.</p>
<p>Second, it is commendable that they can pay attention to issues that people in society do not value.</p>
<p>Third, they want to eliminate bedbugs, not with empty talk, but by studying the life of bedbugs, which is a very appropriate method.</p>
<p>In addition, the scope of their research this time is very broad, including the physiological organization, life state, and reproduction of bedbugs, as well as what kind of germs bedbugs can transmit, and the natural enemies of bedbugs. It is possible that the results of research from all parties in the future will not only discover a method to eradicate bedbugs, but also make new contributions to biology. It would be great if ordinary students could take this opportunity to study bedbugs and arouse their interest in studying other things.</p>
<h3>Lei Yue Mun (Carp Gate)</h3>
<p>— Hua Jia</p>
<p>As soon as the ship left Hong Kong's Sulphur Channel, some timid female passengers began to panic, shouting incessantly—</p>
<p>"Lei Yue Mun is coming! After Lei Yue Mun, we won't be able to see the horizon! The waves will be big this time. Amitabha, may the Bodhisattva protect us: may the wind be calm and the waves be still."</p>
<p>They were shouting and warning each other, some even preparing soda crackers in case they couldn't swallow food when the waves got really big, and others with weaker bodies even putting basins and the like in front of their beds, preparing for the convenience of vomiting. So the female passengers became chaotic.</p>
<p>I woke up in a daze, and seeing them so busy and flustered, I couldn't help but find it a little funny, but when I thought about it carefully, it was terrible: it was my first time going out into the ocean, and I was alone, and what if I encountered a storm, and the ship was battered by huge waves, and what if my unhealthy body couldn't bear it and I started vomiting.</p>
<p>"It's really scary to travel alone."</p>
<p>I vaguely remembered my friend saying this sincerely when he saw me off on the ship. When my heart was filled with emotion, I didn't feel the preciousness of this sentence, but until this moment of "calling to heaven but no response, calling to earth but no answer," I couldn't help but admit the truth of it. But—</p>
<p>"But what can I do? A person has no choice but to live. When you have to embark on a journey alone to find your livelihood, you can't avoid it no matter what. For the sake of life, everything…"</p>
<p>"…must be sacrificed, what is there to regret? I comforted my friend, comforted myself, like a prisoner calmly going to execution. I didn't show any signs of distress from parting."</p>
<p>"Lei Yue Mun, passing Lei Yue Mun!"</p>
<p>Following the unnatural movement of the ship, I heard this loud sound that sounded like a wail.</p>
<p>I wanted to stand up, put on my shoes and go to the deck to see what Lei Yue Mun looked like. But because the ship was moving too much, I had just stood up and fell back down. After all, it was my first time experiencing the waves, so I wasn't used to it. The ship was moving up and down very quickly and in a seemingly reckless manner! Its irregular movements were like the restless roar of a hungry lion.</p>
<p>Therefore, I could only lie down prostrate. As I lay down, my eyes watched the waves going up and down in the porthole, and I felt a little dizzy, and my brain was twitching with pain. Lonely and terrifying journey, let it destroy me! When I was helpless, I could only curse.</p>
<p>"Vomit, vomit, gag! Vomit!"</p>
<p>The women began to vomit. The horrible vomiting sounds and some bad smells I began to feel scared, using my eyes to search, the women are pale lips inlaid in a terrible pale gray face.</p>
<p>Groaning and weak sounds also drilled into the ear.</p>
<p>But the ship was still rushing forward with its life, it was so stubborn.</p>
<h3>Ode to the Moth</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>One evening in late spring, after dinner, I returned to my pigeon cage-like narrow room, feeling as if my heart had been removed, without any support, and too lazy to move, as if I was filled with annoyance and frustration, but I couldn't figure out where it came from. To put it euphemistically, perhaps I was entangled in the languid spring melancholy. Just when I had a belly full of nameless depression with nowhere to vent, suddenly a small animal fluttered in from the window. The light and leisurely sound of its wings vibrating caused me to open my closed eyes. I didn't expect it to be a moth, with dusty gray powder on its wings, quite beautiful. It flew straight to the lamp, circling around incessantly, leaving, and then returning to the lamp again and again! My gaze followed it as it soared with great difficulty, as if it had flown in from outside the window. I thought it would eventually fly out again, but for a long time I didn't see it fly away, as if it never wanted to fly to the dark outside again. Thinking that I had nothing to do anyway, I stood up to relieve my boredom, and grabbed a fan to wave at it vigorously, initially wanting to drive it away to be done with it. Because the little sound of it flying up and down, although very subtle, would only make my thoughts, which desperately needed quiet but were not easy to quiet, even</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>more chaotic if it continued to make a fuss. However, no matter how much I chased and drove it away, it just wouldn't leave. Several times its wings touched the fan, or it was even hit and fell down, but after struggling for a while, it flew again. And I had gotten a little hot from the chasing. Looking at it, it was truly pitiful and hateful. It clearly had a free and vast world spread out before it, allowing it to roam at will, but it just didn't want that free world, and instead flew from that free world into this unfree small room to suffer the pain of unwarranted collisions, constantly hitting various obstacles on the walls, ceilings, and cups, which was truly unnecessary. It turned out that moths are attracted to light and always pursue light. As soon as they see a place with light, they immediately follow it, as if they have found a reliance, and they never give up on it in their lifetime. Unfortunately, that bright light is often the burial ground where they burn themselves. Fortunately, the lamp now has a glass cover. If it were a candle or a kerosene lamp, it would have lost its little life long ago. But even if it were a candle or a kerosene lamp, it would still bravely and fiercely throw itself onto it, without the slightest fear of poison. Even in the countryside at night, when the lamp is lit with fire, with the flickering flames rising upwards, and a moth flies in, you don't even have to lift a finger, just watch, and soon it won't be able to escape being scorched to ashes by the red flames, its wings scattering down and lying dead on the lamp tray. Now the lamp is covered with a glass bubble, and a white porcelain shade on top, so it just floats around the perimeter of the shade, and the danger of being killed is reduced to almost zero. But I was getting more and more angry. If the lamp wouldn't burn it, I might as well act as the executioner myself. So, taking advantage of when it was resting on the wall, I quietly pressed the fan down on it, and then used two needles to pin down both of its wings, so it couldn't move, but it was still shaking its head frequently. The needles were indeed struggling, it has no breath, fell to the base of the wall, rolled over, slowly crawling, soon flew up again, still flying to the lamp. It stirred feeling a commiseration sympathetic to this ignorant little bug for it warmly find bright of not afraid hard of attrition, This sympathy, in fact, commiseration is rather for own sometimes and even the moth is such brightly is not as brave. In this can not how it is of spring night in, but not think little of moth can make I get of a kind valuable revelation! Heart want of vexation be like uninstall much.</p>
<h3>Carnation</h3>
<p>— Dai Ni</p>
<p>Walking along a small path paved with coal ash under the sparse shade of trees, the setting sun shone horizontally through the gaps in the trees, and two slender shadows, like two lazy snakes, meandered across the surface of the coal ash. They each lowered their heads, stepping with small, rhythmic steps, as if unwilling to disturb the tranquil air of the time. Passing by a row of small wintergreen trees, she reached out her pointed fingers, plucked a clump of freshly sprouting green leaves, and then crushed them casually, muttering to herself as if she were speaking to herself:</p>
<p>"I really want to do something!" Suddenly she looked up at the sky, but a small bird flew from a distance - perhaps the hair on her temples obscured her vision, those trampled tender leaves hanging from her fingers in pieces.</p>
<p>"I once thought so. Man," she did not show any excitement, "but isn't being a wealthy lady comfortable enough?"</p>
<p>"Humph! I really don't know why humans are so cruel! So cruel to a helpless weak woman, without any sympathy?" She suddenly took a few quick steps, as if wanting to distance herself from the melancholy in her heart, just like her companion.</p>
<p>This was the end of the coal ash path, and the spire of the church, dyed by the afterglow of the setting sun, could be seen in the distance. The mournful bells were ringing at this moment, so long, as if hammering at her heart, awakening her.</p>
<p>"I want to go back!" She turned around and said to her companion.</p>
<p>Her companion was already standing behind her. "Man, please forgive me, I really don't have the power to help you; isn't my own life precarious?"</p>
<p>The bells continued to ring, and the returning birds were fluttering restlessly on the tree branches. It was time to return home!</p>
<p>"Alright! Didn't you say I've changed? Humph! There are many people changing!" She looked at the sparkling cross on the church spire like a star.</p>
<p>Her companion took a step closer, almost touching her temples. "Now is not the time to be angry. Man, don't get too excited! What I said about you changing—it's your life that has changed, it's the environment that's forcing you! If you want to make up your mind to do something, you must first improve your life, and that is to first break…" He saw that the other party was staring blankly without any emotion! So he changed the direction of his words: "We can really go, maybe your husband is quietly opening the cabinet door to look for your shadow."</p>
<p>A smile floated on the corner of her mouth, and she gently tapped him on the shoulder with her palm. "What do I care? Watch, I'm going to become even more amazing to you!"</p>
<p>They returned to normal, side by side, and exited the park gate from the side, slowly walking towards the tram station.</p>
<p>She stopped in front of a flower shop, first tidying up her messy hair in front of the glass window, and then pushed the door in and bought a bouquet of carnations that she did not like.</p>
<p>"Do you admit that you've changed?" he said with a smile. "Why buy such plain-colored flowers?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the other party laughed and bent over. "These are what my husband likes, you know!" She deliberately kissed the flowers that were about to wither.</p>
<p>"Then, isn't she a virtuous wife!"</p>
<p>That seemed to sting her heart, and the corners of her mouth turned down. She bit her lip with her teeth, and sobbed, "Min, do you want me to be a virtuous wife?"</p>
<p>Her companion did not expect that a playful word would spark her true feelings, and stammered uneasily: "Man, forgive me, we should cooperate, don't you believe it was a joke?</p>
<p>"Yes. You understand me, but I'm too heartfelt, I thought of my husband." A rickshaw came over to solicit business, and she jumped on it. "Alright, goodbye." She handed the carnations in her hand to her companion.</p>
<p>"Don't you also like plain-colored flowers?"</p>
<p>Waving her hand, the rickshaw ran away. He stared at the bouquet of carnations that were about to wither for a long time.</p>

<h3>Lianhua Trains Sound Film Talents</h3>
<p>Lianhua is proceeding with the production of sound films in a well-planned and discreet manner. After successful experimentation over a long period of time, they have spent ample time preparing the script. Now, they are also actively preparing for the training of actors.</p>
<p>Among Lianhua's actors, such as Jin Yan, Chen Yanyan, Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Zhang Yi, Zheng Junli, Liu Jiqun, Li Keng, Shang Guanwu, and Hong Jingling, all speak fluent Mandarin, and most of them have stage experience. However, in Lianhua's entire acting team, there are still some who need to be trained, so Lianhua recently organized a drama and music association.</p>
<p>This drama and music association has separate categories including Peking Opera, Chinese music, Western music, singing, etc. Each department has hired specialized talents to serve as professors. All male and female actors are natural members, and staff members can freely join this organization. The opening ceremony will be held on June 6th. From this, we can know the steady steps and ambition of Lianhua's sound film production.</p>
<h3>Yihua and Silver Flowers</h3>
<p>"The Beginning of Man" has been selling well at the Jincheng Theater recently, with no sign of decline. Most of the audience are young men and women, and people in the film circle also go to watch it every day.</p>
<p>"The Storm" filmed a scene of a storm last night. Although it was man-made, it looked like a real scene because of the complete equipment.</p>
<p>Ma Loufen plays a young idler who does not engage in proper business in "Hero of the Times", indulging in brothels and women all day long.</p>
<p>Jiutong Liang Dusheng, after having considerable success in "The Beginning of Man", now plays a car driver in "Hero of the Times".</p>
<p>Wang Naidong, who specializes in playing bad guys, has been very busy these days. He acts in "The Storm" during the day and performs in "Hero of the Times" in the evening, but he is in excellent spirits and shows no signs of weariness, which is admired by his colleagues.</p>
<p>Ding Xiangshen, the chief accountant of Yihua, plays a figure from the early years of the Republic of China in "Hero of the Times". It is said that his every move has a "history".</p>
<p>Since the public release of "The Beginning of Man", Hu Ping has received letters from fans praising her successful portrayal of an old man, averaging more than fifty letters a day. This has been the case every day for the past seven days. However, each letter asks for ten recent photos. In order not to disappoint her fans, Hu specially printed 500 recent photos yesterday, costing 25 yuan.</p>
<p>Amu Niya Jin Yi plays a clerk in "Hero of the Times".</p>
<p>The work on "Triumphant Song" is as intense as ever.</p>
<h3>About Nostalgia</h3>
<p>Mei Xi plays an enthusiastic young man in "Nostalgia". He fled from the artillery fire in his hometown to Shanghai, but unfortunately, he encountered a second disturbance and struggled in the continuous artillery fire. In the midst of the fire, he angrily shouted: "Where are the youths of China?" Hearing these two shouts, it is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Zhao Dan plays a hunchbacked old man who wanders around. He can be said to have vividly portrayed the personality of a poor old man. On the night of the secret screening of Nostalgia, people watched his expression and unanimously praised his genius for great acting. Zhao Dan will give a new recognition to those who care about movies.</p>
<p>Gao Qianping has always been known for playing feudal and charming women in her previous films. Here, she has changed her previous style and plays a resolute and strong-willed woman. When the young master Sun Min ran to her residence with drunken eyes and flirted with her, she actually clashed with him and bravely repelled Sun Min. Gao Qianping is also good at acting in dramas with diverse personalities. His genius for acting is known to all.</p>
<h3>"Parents and Children" Information</h3>
<p>Since the start of filming, all the cast and crew of the Culture Film Company's all-sound dialogue film "Parents and Children" have been working with extraordinary intensity. They work every night from dusk until the red sun rises the next morning, so more than half of the film has now been completed. It is said that the results are excellent.</p>
<p>When the "Expedition Song" in the film "Parents and Children" was recorded the night before, many male and female students from the National Conservatory of Music were invited to participate in the chorus, accompanied by the Paramount Orchestra. The singing was tragic and enthusiastic, and everyone who heard it was thrilled. The "Expedition Song" was composed by the famous musician Mr. Liu Yunjü, and the lyrics were written by the film's director, Hu Xinling. It is majestic and moving, and it is expected that it will be known to every household in the future.</p>
<p>Miss Min Qunying, a famous socialite in Shanghai, is skilled in calligraphy and painting. People in Shanghai have long been aware of her achievements on the stage. The name "Genius Miss" has also been widely spread on the Chun Shen River because of this. This time, she is making a cameo appearance as the protagonist in the Culture Company's "Parents and Children". It is said that her performance before the camera is even better than on the stage. The so-called "Genius Miss is still a Genius Miss."</p>
<p>The song and dance scenes in "Parents and Children" are unprecedentedly magnificent, costing no less than several thousand gold, which is indeed a new era for domestic films. Not only is the scene great, the scenery is gorgeous, and the costumes are bright, and the dance is superb, but at the same time, the consciousness is also very correct. According to the song and dance drama: "Ten Thousand Taels of Gold" symbolizes the liberation of women and the advent of a new era, so it cannot be compared with the general so-called song and dance performances at present, and it is especially icing on the cake that it is starred by Miss Gong Qiuxia, the leader in the song and dance world.</p>
<h3>"Cardinal Richelieu" Opens</h3>
<p>Ever since George Arliss filmed "The Millionaire," fans have been eager for his work day and night. United Artists then adapted the life and achievements of Duke Richelieu, the 17th-century French Archbishop, and hired Mr. George Arliss to star in it, because the protagonist's personality is extremely difficult to perform, and Mr. Arliss is the only one who can do it. Supporting actors such as Edward Arnold (who played the Roman Emperor in Edith Cortay's "Royal Bed"), Marlene O'Shaughnessy, the heroine of "Tarzan and His Mate," and others are all outstanding talents, so they complement each other perfectly. "Cardinal Richelieu" is not only rich in historical value, but also a great collection of the Eighth Art. It is the greatest and most magnificent of historical religious palace films in recent years, and it is United Artists' supreme authoritative work. At the same time, the first color short film of Mickey Mouse, "The Concert," and the United Artists color music film "The Midas Touch" are also worth noting. Below is a scene from the film.</p>
<p>Letter on behalf: Mr. Ling He, there is a letter deposited in the Film News Editorial Department, please come to the Museum after 5:00 today.</p>
