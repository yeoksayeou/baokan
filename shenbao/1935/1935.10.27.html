<h3 id="c17">太平洋上航空綫拓展的意義 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近關於太平洋上航空綫的拓展。有幾個重要的消息。値得注意。（一）經營年餘的橫渡太平洋航空綫。由汎美航空公司承辦。在下月中將作全綫的試騐飛行。明年一月卽可正式通航。其路綫以舊金山為起點。暫以澳門為終點。將來或可通至香港。而最後則希望達到我國南部的口岸。（二）本月十三日。美國當局宣布以南太平洋的迦維斯·培克·及霍倫三島。收入美國版圖。準備開闢從夏威夷到澳洲的航空綫。使英美的航空綫相啣接。而以這三島爲中途的重要分站。（三）在本月初旬。英國航空督辦斯密士氏來遠東視察皇家空軍隊的根據地。表示英國將在香港建立一巨大的民用及軍事航空根據地。到了二十四日。皇家空軍隊飛機杜拉都號從檳榔嶼試飛到香港。造成十二小時的紀錄。據說還要繼續試飛。大概英澳航空綫由新加坡分一支綫到香港。在不久以後也將成事實。</p>
<p>從世界交通的發展上着想，上述的消息都是可喜的。在廣大的世界上。人類散居於幾塊陸地。中間隔着遼闊的海洋。這種自然的阻障。是造成人類間隔膜的一個原因。由於科學的發展。人頓居然有了凌空御風超越海洋的工具。這在促成國際的協作。人類的親睦的理想上。當是一種重要的助力。但現在的事實似乎並不然。今日舉世惶惶的。是人類間的敵視與國際間的猜忌所造成的戰爭危機。目前許多國家的科學工具。沒有為和平的理想而努力。乃在聽從戰神的指揮。在太平洋上的風雲中。忽然有了這許多飛機的活躍。對於那些征服自然的勇士。我們固然抱着莫大的敬意。但在同時。對於這種航空綫拓展的意義。却也不免有相當的疑慮。</p>
<p>在近數年中。太平洋的四岸戰雲瀰漫。這期問所有的航空活動。似乎都不能脫離軍事的關係。美國成立橫渡太平洋的航空綫。其所經各島。大部分已置於軍部管理之下。英國通到遠東的航空綫。也都是由皇家空軍隊主持的。我們讀了本年八月份美國水星雜誌所載「飛機翼下的日本」一文。知道一九三一年以來日本軍事預算的激增。也與軍用航空的發展有關的。目前太平洋上各國航空綫的競爭。已引起政治外交上的重要作用。汎美航空公司對於太平洋上航空綫的路綫及終點。因為「外交上的微妙關係。一至今還是嚴守秘密。同時。據美聯社的消息。歐洲國家因為美國航空綫的拓展。也力謀鞏固歐亞間的航空交通。如英國的計劃拓展航空綫至中國。法國的允許英國航空綫通過安南。使它的航空綫也能在香港得一停落點。從河內達到中國。都是顯著的證明。</p>
<p>列强的航空綫都希望以我國為終點。是極可注意的一種情形。太平洋上的風雲。本來是以中國問題為重心的。如今太平洋上航空綫的積極伸向我國海岸。尤可以顯出列强企圖奪取我國門戶的支配權的野心。在未來太平洋上的大爆發中。我國將整個地處於他人機翼的威脅之下了。就現狀說。我們華北與東部沿岸的天空。常有異國的飛機任意翱翔。我國的領空權被破壞無遺。巳顯示了未來禍患的端倪。因為太平洋上列强航空綫的拓展。聯帶想到了這裏所蘊藏着的危機。特為提出來。請我國當局和民衆嚴加注意。</p>

<p>市長致詞　席間首由吳市長致歡迎詞、略謂、有吉大使·井上博士·各位先生、各位來賓·今天集本市學術界領袖·暨工商界鉅子於一堂、來歡迎日本工政會代表團、兄弟忝爲地主、謹備菲酌、招待諸君、深爲愉快、日本工政會、是日本頗負聲譽的學術團體、各代表均係學術界著名之士、團長井上先生、係工學博士、曾任鐵道省大臣、其學問經騐、久所欽佩、今日得聆敎益、尤覺榮幸、此番到滬、舉行學術講演、以緒君子積學之深、自必有許多可貴而專門的卓識、可供本市學術界的借益、現代各國的學術、抓已突破了固有的國界的藩籬、發生了密切的國際的聯繫、雖然、每一個民族、都有他獨具的特性、特殊的國情、以及不同的需要、然而在「他山之石、可以攻玉、」的原則上、非但任何民族、不應該「深閉固拒」、同時任何有文化的民挨、也不能够「唯我獨尊」、過去人類文化的進步、固多由於互相切磋、互相琢磨、互相借鑑、互相慕仿、將來世界文化的進步、更不能不有待於人類的互助與合作、所以互助合作、是人羣進化的極則、嫉忌爭鬥、乃文化毀滅的病源、中日兩國、同文同種、過去兩國文化·學術·經濟·社會·的進步、自然不能否認彼此互助合作的歷史的因緣、今天、兄弟特集這次的盛會、希望我們中日兩國的學術界、不要忽略了我們過去這一段可貴的歷史的因緣、澈底認識這一僩人羣進化的極則、本着合作的精神、來企圖我們東方民族文化學術的進步、尤其要本着互助的德性、來奠定我們東亞和平的基礎、</p>
<p>井上答詞　吳市長致歡迎詞畢、繼由井上博士致答詞、略謂、現在國家均以工業爲其立國之基礎、東亞兩鄰國、應一致開發工業、如果兩國朝野、均能採取西洋文化、融貫東洋固有文化、則將來必能超出歐美各國文明之上、看到目前國際情勢、在東亞祇靠一國努力進步、還是不够、一定要使兩國同求發展、方可使東亞文明進步、此次敝國來華訪問、完全本於此旨、第一、要交換兩國學術之研究及經驗、由兩國互相提携、以謀工業技術之聯絡、增進東亞民族之福祉、而貢獻於永久之和平、爲達到　目的、將來我人願充分將日本在過去努力中所嘗到之困難及經騐、以告中國、而供參考云、</p>
<p>開講演會　吳市畏之宴席完畢後、即繼開講演會、由吳市長推定何柏丞爲主席、首由主席致開會詞、</p>
<p>主席致詞　主席何柏丞致開會詞云、井上團長、吳市長、工政會訪華代表團諸位團員、全體中外來賓、今天日本工政台訪華代表團和令體來賓、在此地舉行學術講演會、我承吳市長推任主席、極感榮幸、我在宣布開會宗旨以前、有幾點竟思、應得以主席的資格、先向諸位表示　下、第一、我們應該謝謝吳市長、他不但享我們一頓極豐盛的筵席、並且給我們這樣一個交換意見的好機會、第二、我們對於今天到會的全體中外來賓、都應該表示歡迎、尤其是不遠千里而來的工政會訪華代表團諸位團員、第三、我們對於今天担任講演的二位專家、應該特別歡迎、我敢預言、他們講演一定都是很有價值的、口譯的工作、亦非專門學者不能做得出色、我們今天能够請到曾廣方先生來會担任、實在非常這氣、我們亦應該歡迎他、還有一點、使我個人發生了一種有趣味的困難、我今天既忝爲講演會的主席、同時又忝爲中華學藝社的理事長、現在我們旣在中華學藝社的總社所中開會、所以我一面不得不以理事長的資格、乘便代表中華學藝社理事會、向全體來賓、表示歡迎的意思、同時我又不得不以主席的資格、代表今天的來賓、向中華學藝社、表示借座的盛意、現在讓我繼續簡單說明今天開會的宗旨、我們大家都知道我們東方各民族、數千年來、雖然文明程度都是很高、但向來都不免有偏重精神方面的毛病、例如東方的儒釋道三大思潮、雖都極其高尙而且精深、但都不免偏重道德上或精神上的修養、而忽略了物質上的發展、我們東方人爲適應現代環境起見、應該冬用一點精力到物質的研究上去、今天的講演會、可以就說是這種動向的具體的表演、其次、我們中國的國民政府和人民、都深知物質建設的重要、而且都已努力做這種功夫、例如近年來航空·鐵路·公路·的建設、成績都非常顯著、中外人士莫不稱道、但當此科學進步一日千里的時代、我們必須常常和別國的專家交換新的經騐、和有價值的學說、來做我們大家的參考、今天的講演、就是這一種新的經驗和學說的交換、又次、我們大家都知道、我們東鄰日本的實業、非常發達、他在工程方面的建設、尤其有長足的進步、今天到會的工政會訪華代表團、各位團員、都是這一種事業的先進、他們在這一方面所經騐到的成功和失敗、對於我們中國、因爲同文同種的關係、尤其有參考的價值、所以我們今天這個講演會、可以說是一種提倡物質建設和交換工程知識的集會、我們藉此可以得到許多有價值的參考資料、使得我們東方文明系統中的民族、並駕齊驅、達到現代化的階段、此外、我相信剛才吳市長在宴會席上所說的國際間平等的諒解和親善、一定要在這一種知識交換的高尙工作中、才可以充分的而且有效的達到了目的、這就是我們今天舉行這個講演會的宗旨、現在因爲時間寶貴、我們應該開始依照預定的日程、請二位專家講演、在講演以前、我們還要先向全體來賓、宣讀中國和日本兩國政府當局的賀電、我們應該先向中日兩國政府當局道謝獎勉的盛意、再者今天報載、黎照寰先生被撞受傷、因此不能到會、我們一面表示惋惜、一面並表示慰問、好在他已有講稿交來、託由吳市長轉交代表團了、</p>
<p>汪外長詞　主席致詞畢、由外交部司長高宗武代表汪兼外長、宣讀歡迎詞云、日本近年工業之雄飛猛進、以及製造品質之優良、已爲世界所公認、故敝國國民、對於日本人士之富於技術天才、以及其孜孜努力科學之精神、夙深欽佩、此次工政會訪華代表團蒞會諸君、均屬學術實業兩界領袖、深望觀察之餘、出其偉論、有所啟發、而我國現值過渡時代、舍科學救國外、別無他途、更盼我國學術界、見賢思齊、亦能念起直追、銳　研求、本所學以報國、則產業界之落伍、胥能以科學補救其缺陷、而國民經濟之建設、必由是可以漸覜厥成矣、是此次工政會代表之來華、不僅足以增進兩國人民之友誼、其有裨於我國工業前途之發展、當非淺鮮也、敬此奉頌、再祝諸君之健康、民國二十四年十月二十六日、兼署外交部長汪兆銘、</p>
<p>日外相詞　繼由有吉大使宜讀日本外務大臣廣田弘毅祝詞云、此次日本工政會代表團、訪問中華民國的機會、得着中日兩國各界的贊助、今天能够在此兩國學界最高權威者會同之下、開誠聯合講演會、實在是可慶可賀的事、回顧沂來、中日兩國的關係、不得不說有些微把人文發達上最重要的學術共同研究的機會、錯過去的遺憾、他方面、在民間又缺乏這種協力合作、以致兩國國交上有些隔膜、這是本大臣深爲遺憾的、如此的狀態、好像是把很有價值的書籍埋在地裏去、或把很好的米麥財帛、死藏在倉庫裏一樣、斷不楚對於眞理和各自的國家忠實的緣故、當幾年以前、在東京開萬國工業會議之時、雖然中日邦交、還在嚴重的時期、貴國的學者虛心坦懷的央參加的不少、這足以證明貴國學者、對於眞理的熱誠、我們早在當時已然欽佩不已的、若去掉時之感情、而順應永遠的歷史法則、去掉局部的見解、而由高處達觀大局、我們就很容易看得出來、中日兩國、應常在以相文會、以道相交的因緣、又在痛癢相關、唇齒輔車之關係、就是中日兩國、本然的狀態、古人所說的、誠意正心、是培養道德的正路、格物致知、是追求科學的方法、這兩件原是一元的兩面、不可偏倚的、然而現代的弊病、就在偏倚、我們東亞之所慮、就在科學之缺之、東亞的獨立、等確立了東亞產業獨立之後、纔能求其完成、而東亞產業的獨立、等充實了東亞所缺少的科學的技能然　纔能實　牠、古　說得好、無敎則非邦、我們敝國、過去一千年以來、藉貴　文化的註釋同反照、努力鍊磨了我們的本來面目、現在在紳粹科學以及應川工學的分野之內、已然達到了世界的水準、貴國朝野、如果把隣邦日本所有的這科學的能力虛心坦懷的認識收納、兩者彼此依賴、可以實現一種文質彬彬、精神物質兩方面、並　齊驅的新文運的發展、這是本大臣信而不疑的、然而這可以說是我們束亞在世界　廣居之內、應當要担負的共同的義務了、昭和十年十月二十六日、外務大臣廣田弘毅、</p>
<p>日商相詞　尙有石射總領事宣讀日本商工大臣松田源治祝詞云、今天在這中日兩國工業界的權威者聯合之下、開一學術演講會　時候、鄙人得到了敬致祝詞的機會、覺得非常榮幸的、東亞各國從古以來、有密切的關係、在文化的交涉上、彼此互相影響的眞不小、這是不用鄙人在此細說的、尤其是最近的情勢、同人感覺東亞各國間的協力合作的必要然而正在這時機上、本以貢獻東方工業技術學術的聯絡、提携爲宗旨、開一兩國聯合講演會、實在是得其時宜、而且很可以裨益東方工業界的、這是一定而不必懷疑的、參加本會的緒先生、請鑒於本會開會的宗旨、相互交換其學術和知識、並希望得到十分美滿的結果、以貢獻東洋工業文化的向上發展、這是鄙人所最希望的、昭和十年十月廿六日日本商工大臣松田源治、尙有實業部部長陳公博代表劉維熾次長致祝詞、（從略）</p>
<p>學術講演　旋由主席介紹日本文學博士圓谷弘及交通大學校長黎照寰先後演講、圓谷弘博士演講題爲「日本之工業敎育」、黎氏講題爲「工程學與實業之關係」、黎氏因於前日　汽車撞傷足部、故未能出席、即將講演稿交由吳市長轉送該團、（兩方演詞另行發表、末由主席何柏丞致閉會詞云、諸位來賓、現在圓谷弘先生的講演、已告結束了、我們雖然祇有一位先生的講演、但確已能充分表現我剛才在開會詞裏而所叙述的宗旨、我相信今天參加聽講的各位來賓、一定都和我一樣、感覺非常愉快、非常欽佩、我現在謹以主席的資格、代表大家向圓谷弘先生表示謝意、並向他們道喜講演的成功、同時對于好幾位口講者工作的辛苦、和諸位來賓的盛意參加、始終不懈、我亦得順便在此地一併道謝、現在我們散會、希望明日再來、</p>

<p>新聲社云、本市租界電話加價問題、經工部局聘請中英美日四國電話專家、費二月長期之討論、業於昨日將報告電轉工部局審核、新聲社記者特向有關各方探詢意見、藉作市民之研究、茲特分述如下、</p>
<p>調查範圍　尚欠切要</p>
<p>查工部局先與電話公司預約、在自動裝置完竣後、得重訂　目表、俾公司能於　資上可有純年息百分之八分之百分之一、已　根本錯誤、而此次所給各專家調查之範圍、簡言之、僅以應否加價、與應加若干為題目、其對於民眾使用電話、在電話公司現行各種制度下、是否堪稱完全便利與滿意、均少顧及、是中外民眾、對於該局立場、至今仍難諒解、再根據專家報告書中所指電話公司改裝自動機時、費用之浩大、與普通及業務二項費用之可驚、確均事實、足見公司僅知加價為開源之唯一辦法、而不知節流、亦能使利益之增進、</p>
<p>通話收費　理應取消</p>
<p>本埠電話用戶之所最感痛苦者、莫如租界與市內額外通話費之徵收、報告書內所稱、「吾人對於兩個當局所辦之電話系統、其間用戶、可以自由通話、而不須收費者、誠無前例可援」、一語、經各方調查、尚非事實、即以小呂宋兩個電話局論、其間通話并無徵收窗外話費之舉、目專家委員、既擬定採用按次收費辦法、則尤應主張通話費之即行取消、俾得節省開支、改進話務、方為公允、抑尤有進者、兩區間直接撥號通話、技術上已屬可能、絕無懷疑必要、而各委員對於此點、未能在經濟上技術上作切實之建議、本市民眾、實深遺憾、沿希電話公司與電話局當局、在最短期間、對於上述兩點、即予改良、</p>
<p>長途接綫　應求迅速</p>
<p>上海電話公司用戶所傳受之長途電話、須經話局及公司雙重之長途台叫接、因此手續倍增、單浪減低耗財費時、不一而足、實為世界各國所鮮見、如雙方當局、果能採取專家之建議、將電話公司所設之長途電台、即行取銷、使公司用戶之長途電話、能直接呌接上海電話局閘北分局之長途台則必可增進效率不少也、</p>

<p>水災義賑會為代各地災民請命起見、商請本屆全運足球冠軍香港隊、與本埠著名之葡萄牙足球隊、於昨日下午三時、作賑災賽於市中心區運動塲、參觀者二三千人、香港隊挾全運之餘威、葡萄牙多沙塲宿將、兩方實力原甚充實、惜港隊前鋒去一李惠堂、無異無頭之蛇、後方失一包家平、何殊授人以隙、目葡萄牙據北攻南、胡人乘朔北而牧馬、已得天時之利香港隊連日疲戰又如一盤散沙無人和之長、於是港隊乃於上半時以零對四收績、差幸下半時人人抱必死之心、時時作雪恥之圖、破釜沉舟和衷共濟、戰情旣立呈壯烈、大局始漸見澄清、乃得牧復一城、然時不再來、卒以二對四受挫、</p>
<p>葡軍來勢猖獗</p>
<p>開戰後、葡人因得猛烈之東北風爲助氣熖甚熾但見繡有十字徽號之白衣人跳盪逐鹿於中原、藍衣白字之香島健兒頓有顧此失彼之態、僅持混戰之局决無反抗能力、於是乃為敵軍左內鋒L羅柴遼攻入一球首開紀錄、葡人旣獲首球、銳氣益振、球常盤旋於港軍陣地、不久葡中堅考期坦遠射為左翼愛達耶截獲、沿邊深入、舉足猛射、港門將黃華繼、不敢怠慢、急仆救竟失手滑脫、致又為葡中鋒柯拉沙所乘、撥球入網續戰葡軍跋扈益甚、右內鋒羅脫挑球送達港隊門前、右內鋒梁現贊原擬頂球出界、不料反自殺球急入網、致成三比零之局、此後港隊雖一度反攻、但未得手反爲葡隊柯拉沙冉陷一城、遂以四比零結束上半時、</p>
<p>反攻收效甚微</p>
<p>港葡易地再戰、港軍義憤塡膺、前鋒大見活躍、且得風勢更如虎添翼鄭季良出入百萬軍中、如入無人之境、不數分鐘葡隊處女身、即爲港隊一前鋒以「之」字形之傳遞、由鄭季良一頂而破、淸晰爽脆得未曾有、成四比一此後良機雖多、失機亦頻、十分鐘後曹桂成向敵軍右翼陣地進襲、中鋒亦列雁陣遙為呼應、曹盤蹴至相當地點、即　命中路諸將、葡城又破、此後計港隊盛氣凌人、譚江柏調任中鋒、聲勢益壯、葡人氣熖、至是稍戢、惜乎時間已屆、反攻終至失效、二比四完塲、陣綫如下、</p>

<p>「你們願意和我一比嗎」？南恩說道，殊有躍躍欲試一顯身手的神情。</p>
<p>韜摩斜倚着牆頭，看去甚是疲倦，說道：「天氣太熱了」。</p>
<p>南恩銳利的眼睛從一個臉兒瞟到另一個臉兒，見到太腓愁着臉，問道：「太腓幹嗎」？</p>
<p>解客面上堆着藐視的神色，同答道：「球打傷他的手；碰到什麽都是呌嚷着」。</p>
<p>「我不，我從不，無論受了怎麽大的傷痛；叫嚷眞像是小實寶一般的」。南恩說道，說來殊有一種高傲的神氣。</p>
<p>「太腓受了那種批評的激動，回答道：呸，我可以使你在兩分鐘裏哭起來」。</p>
<p>「看你能够罷！」</p>
<p>太腓指着牆邊一株有硬刺的樹，說道：「那末去摘那一球的刺罷」。</p>
<p>南恩立刻「揑住了那把刺」，拔起了它，以一種一怕什麽」的神氣還是捏在手裏不放，離然那柿利害的　痛幾乎是不能忍受的。</p>
<p>「你眞了不得」，童子們齊聲喊着，他們見得女子能有這般勇氣，自然也爲之改容。</p>

<p>— 玲</p>
<p>讀書，分死讀書租活讀書。甚麼呌死讀書？甚麼呌活讀書？待我慢慢講來。</p>
<p>我們平時在學校裘，上課時聽敎師講授，下課時和同學討論，這種種都是從書本上得來的知識，書本上的知識，我們應該誠懇地去接受，因為書本上有許多事情，我們在平日不能看見而不能聽見的，讀了書本，便會知道，但是我們要有廣大的知識，一定要在這偉大的環境中去找尋，因書本上得的知識，只會知道而不會澈底明白，於是腦海中常存着疑惑，專讀書本而不去實騐，便是死讀書，那麼怎樣活讀書呢？我們要在每日生活中一切現象，照書本上所說的去研究考察，看實騐的和書本上的相同否，這種實騐出來的知識，能深刻在腦海中，永遠不會忘記的。</p>
<p>各位發明家，他們都因研究實驗而發明各種東西，他們不但為本國爭光，而且世界上的人們都得到他的利益。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們願意做發明家嗎？那麼應該在這寶貴的童年時代，一方面用功地讀書，一方面努力去研究，將來如能發明東西，不但有益於社會，而能替中華民國爭光，到那時。你便會想到活讀書的益處。</p>
<h3 id="c165">模範小朋友 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>小四子是一個苦孩子，他的爹爹，是一個出賣勞力的工人，他的媽媽，是一個帮着人家作工的貧婦，他生活在這麼一個貧苦的家庭中，自然沒有讀書的權利的了。但是小四子却很愛讀書，他雖然沒有錢進學校，但見到街上有提了書包上學去的小孩子，他總是眼紅得甚麼似的。</p>
<p>但是今年秋間，離他家一條街過的那個小學校，忽然開辦了一個識字學校了。眞是出乎意料之外的，小四子也在他的爹的萬分不願意的情緒之下，被强迫着進識字學校去念書。念書，正是小四子所求之不得的，於是便在開學的那天，興怱忽地去上學了。</p>
<p>雖然小四子還只八歲，但因為求學心切，識字很認眞，所以在全班五十人中，他的成績最好。儘有許多五十歲六十歲的老公公老婆婆，都考在他的後面，這一樂，直樂得小四子從睡夢裏都直笑醒過來。</p>
<p>因為小四子肚裏，如今也識着幾百字，而且因在學校裏習了些規矩，也就不像沒念書時那麽的一個野孩子了。見了人，也懂得鞠躬，說話也懂得禮貌了。雖然身上的衣衫，還是穿得那麽破舊，但是三天二天的自己洗濯，也不似先前那麽的惹人厭惡了。於是便有一位近鄰的先生，預備介紹他到一家商舖子裏去學業。</p>
<p>昨天，我遇到他，問他這幾天在幹些甚麽事。他說：「我這幾天，正在弄一篇辛亥革命的故事。預備上台去演講。雖然我的演講，不滿十分鐘，但昨天練習時，先生說我演講得很好呢。先生，到那一天，你可有興來聽我演講麽？」</p>
<p>小四子本來是一個野孩子，但念了二個月書，完全變了一個人了，懂得禮貌，會得演講，會讀白話的小文，而且將成為一家商舖子裏的學徒了。雖然他的出身很貧苦，但我以為這倒是小朋友的一個很好的模範。</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>眼涙是怎麽來的呢？這是我們應當明白的一點小知識，我們平日當悲哀的時候，不知不覺的有眼淚流出來，又在極高興的時候，也有眼淚流出來的，換句話來說，就是我們精神上受了激烈的感觸，或是眼鼻的粘膜受了刺激時，眼淚就要流出來的。然而眼淚是什麽樣的東西呢？現在我把生理的緣由，來說給諸位聽，我們的兩隻眼睛裏，每隻各有兩個淚腺，這淚腺就是製造眼淚的地方。其製造的分量，四季不同的，春秋兩季，製造量不多，極寒酷暑的時候，製造得最多，眼淚就是從這四個淚腺中分泌出來。這淚對於眼球有很大的功用，能够預防兩隻眼球不會乾燥，使眼球受到相當的潮濕，圓滑眼球迴轉運動，倘若淚的製造，一時停止。那末，眼球就失掉自由的移動，眼睛小能上下左右轉　轉去了；而且眼球還要破裂的，遇到塵埃與微細生物飛到眼裏時，眼中覺到很不舒服，那眼臉就會話動，流出淚來，把眼球完全洗滌，使塵埃夾着淚流出眼角外面，眼球亦不致損傷，所以眼淚，實有很大的功用。又淚腺是在內訾附近，通過淚道，流到鼻腔，　為鼻涕，苟使我們心裏覺到很不快樂的時候，哭泣起來，常常涕淚　流的，就是因為心裏不快樂，威觸到「交感神經」，血管立卽膨脹，周圍的筋肉，忽然緊縮，壓迫淚腺，淚因此連續的流出來了。至於淚的成分，含有百分之一的鹽分，以及蛋白質炭酸曹達等，所以淚流到口內時，覺到帶有鹹味，諸君如吃東西時，切不可把眼淚滴在食物中，因為這極不衛生的。</p>
<h3 id="c168">捉猢猻 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>世界上人類算是最聰明，猢猻的智慧雖不如人，却最喜歡模仿。人類便利用牠的模仿來捉牠。</p>
<p>相傳南通的狠山劍山，從前盤踞著許多野猢猻。牠們住在山林裏面，本是與世無爭，與人無忤。那山下有個蒙館先生，聚徒講學。猢猻們在林子裏遠遠望見，伺候着傍晚放學時，竄進塾內，大猢猻打扮先生，小猢猻裝做徒弟，把那書籍筆墨，亂翻亂點。等到第二天人來時，早已溜之大吉。起初那塾師不明底細，只以為是頑皮學生，故意搗亂。幾個比較會吵的學生，再三受了寃枉的責罰。</p>
<p>但是責罰儘管責罰，搗亂依然搗亂。那先生積疑莫釋，只得私自偵查。果然發現一羣的猢猻如此這般。先生看了，計上心來，便剪了許多紅圓紙兒，命令學生們貼在眼睛上，做捉迷藏之戲。一面關照學生們套着雨天用的木屐上學。放學時木屐要留在塾內。</p>
<p>先生把許多紅紙膏藥留在桌上，一面準備着幾個鄉下人持械埋伏。果然放字以後，猢猻一個個竄進塾內，模仿着學生們穿木展，貼紅紙圈兒，正在玩得高興時，四面人聲叫喊，持械前來。那猢猻們眼睛被膏藥封住，脚上套了木展，亂撞亂奔，只得一個個被人擒住。只算替那幾個寃枉受罰的學生出了口氣。</p>
<h3 id="c169">算盤和結繩 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 尤墨君</p>
<p>「上古結繩而治。」大事結大繩，小事結小繩，以助記憶之所不及；幷且，還有用各色的繩兒，以記各種的事情的。這已在那篇「結繩的故事」文裏約略地述及了。（載九月二十九日本刊）不過人類的智慧是在不斷地發展着，永無停頓之日。往往有以前視為很便當的，後來覺得不大適用了。結繩便是一個例。</p>
<p>結繩不滴用，就有聰明的人們想出改良的法兒來了。現在我們用的算盤，據西方學者研究，就是從結繩改進過來的。算盤中問夾着一根根的藤梗兒，藤梗上面串着一個個的算珠兒。這藤梗初本用那繩的，這算珠兒就是那縛的結兒。這樣帮助記憶，自然是比結繩便當得多，適用得多，而人們也樂於採用了。</p>
<p>那末，最古記事的算盤是什麽樣式的呢？這頗不易考。大約製作是粗陋得很，不過把樹枝圍成一個珠兒，上面再縛着幾條繩罷了，沒有像現在算盤這樣精美。我們現在所用的：有的成九位，有的成十一位，有的成十三位。每條藤梗上各串着七個珠兒。上端的兩個珠兒用橫木隔開。折橫木的，一作五；較上的一顆，或作五，或作十。至於橫木下的五顆，則都一作一。這是後來因人事愈繁，人們的智慧愈加發展，所以能想出這種巧妙的記數工具來。自把它記數，遂不再作記事用。這是從結繩到用算盤的一段演變，幷且也是自然的演變啊。</p>

<p>—壞電泡可做金魚缸—</p>
<p>這個頑意兒，在上次本報上曾登載過一文；可是怎樣做法，未說明白。我看了這篇文章，就動了我頑皮的念頭。一天晚上，閒着沒事，找了幾隻壞電泡，開始試騐，一連做壞了兩隻，不禁奇怪的很！我一面鼓着餘勇，一面沉靜着運用我的腦筋，果然被我試騐成功。我不敢自秘，特地寫了這篇，供獻於我親愛的小朋友們，沒事時，不妨試騐一下！</p>
<p>（一）材料—壞電燈泡一隻。（要絲斷而泡子不能破的。）</p>
<p>（二）工具—刀子一把，鐵錐子一柄，小剪子一把，淸水一盆。</p>
<p>（三）做法—先將刀子將電泡上頭火漆蓋子剜去，（要輕輕的剜，）然後放滿水在銅箍裏，一手緊拿住電泡放在水盆裏，一手拿着錐子對住銅箍正中的電泡心子用力一搗，則燈心卽斷落下來，（搗時要留心燈泡不觸着盆底子）卽拿着剪子將燈泡放在水裏剪去那連着燈心上面的玻璃，剪得靠折銅箍，就成一圓孔，此時把燈心從燈泡裏取出，在銅箍的兩旁銅釘子上用綫緊起來，放些水在泡子裏，養着一兩條小金魚，不是一隻很好頑的金魚缸嗎？</p>
<p>注意—用錐子搗燈心時，銅箍裏必須放滿水，因為電泡不是眞空的嗎？上面有了水，可减輕外面的空氣壓力，泡子就不會壞了。</p>

<p>為什麼要守時？就是因為時間沒有再來的緣故，朱自淸先生說得很好：「樹葉枯了，有再靑的時候，燕子去了，有再來的時候，光陰去了，有再返的時候嗎？聰明的，你告訴我，有再來的時候嗎？」我雖不是個聰明的，然而我敢斷定光陰是沒有再返的。</p>
<p>守時究有多少好處呢？</p>
<p>第一點不費時間，像我們趁車子，二時開車，你若二時一刻到站，車子開去了，等第二班再趁，這中間的光陰，豈不是拋棄了不少，守了時，就不會這樣，那不是「守時」的長處嗎？</p>
<p>第二點不躭誤事。你若不守時，脫了車子，趕不到那目的地，這時你所要做的工作，就被你躭誤了，如果重要的事，有關於大體的，豈不更躭誤了許多人的事嗎？守了時，就不會這樣，那不是「守時」的長處嗎？</p>
<p>第三點可守秩序。像開會，已定於×日上午九時××地方開的，而會員到了那日，有的八時半已到了，有的九時半才到，這樣子前前後後，怎不使會塲秩序紊亂不堪？那裏談得到秩序呢？守了時，就不會這樣，那不是「守時」的長處嗎</p>
<p>第四點辦事率增。因為不守時後，你所做的工作，一定不會比人家多，守時的人，做了二件事，你却只能做一件事，你也守了時，辦事率就不會這樣，那不是「守時」的長處嗎？</p>
<p>綜合以上四點，才知道守了時後，可以不費時間，不躭誤事，可守秩序，辦事率增，小朋友！我希望你們永久準守時間罷！</p>

<p>— 禧</p>
<p>我即忙問道：「夫人，請問這些東西可在那裏呀？」喜鵲答道：「在我的綠宮中，吾愛，你可以瞧到我們在那裏過着怎樣的生活。我們一共有一百多頭，並不是像那村子裏的大喜鵲，常在大路上求乞的，但我們都是出身高貴的名種，身子瘦小而活潑，沒有一個像拳頭那麽大的。我們的身上總是不多不少的，有七條黑色的直紋和五條白色的直紋，這是一個不變的定理，而我們是瞧不起一切別的族類的，你確是並沒有黑色的紋路，然而你的質地是俄羅斯種，這就儘可以給你進那綠宮的門了。我們是借着兩件事情過我們的生活的，一件事情是閒談，一件事情是修飾。從早晨修飾到中午，從中午閒談到黃昏。我們各自棲止在一棵樹上，那樹是越高越好，愈古愈妙的。在那森林的中間，立着一稞極大好豫樹，可惜沒有人住在那裏。這是前犬柏愛（按即喜鵲）十世的故居，我們往往前去巡禮，長嘆而憑弔；但是雖然帶着懷古的輕愁，而我們的光陰是過得異常快樂的。我們那裏凡是為妻的都很腎淑而為夫的也並不嫉妬，我們的快樂是紳粹而眞實，因爲我們的心都很坦曰，眞如我們的說話，很是直爽的一樣。我們的性格都很高傲，倘有，頭樫烏或別的賤種闖　我們中間，我們就一齊起來亳不容情的啄他，然而對於良好的鄰居，卻也我們是　往很優待的，所以那些住在我們矮林中的麻雀和金翅雀等，我們常常準備着帮助他們，分東西給他們吃，並且助他們抵禦外來的敵人。世界中沒有地方找得到像我們這樣愛談話的挨類，而也沒有像我們說得這樣好的。總之，我們是在快　中，高貴中談話中，和修飾中生活着。」</p>
<p>我答道：「夫人，這委實是冉好沒有的了。像你這樣的人，所發的命令，我是沒有不服從的，但我在跟隨你去的以前，請許我和這位好姑娘說一句話。」當下，我便轉身自那斑鳩說道：「我求你從實對我說，你想我眞是一頭俄羅斯種的喜鵲嗎？」</p>

<h3 id="c191">結婚和托兒 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 無為</p>
<p>社會一切的現象，都呌人起無窮的感慨。這兒彷彿是奇妙的園林，不是亂草披離，便是果樹倒栽。單就結婚和托兒兩事而觀，就有這種意味，兒童是社會的新生命，新希望，當此溫飽的家庭日趨破滅之時，對於終朝出外覓食的勞動羣衆，托兒所是何等的需要。然而堂堂皇皇擁有數十萬女工的上海市，僅僅蓬萊路有一個「第一勞動托兒所」，而牠的實况，據昨日的報載，却是這般：</p>
<p>「該所自開辦以來，已閱時一載，對於寄托兒童，敎養兼至，極得家長之稱許。惜其地點距離工廠區域較遠，暨限於經費等原因，致寄托兒童，不能辦到純粹勞動階級。現該所兒童日間寄托者三十名，收費二元；日夜寄托者十名，收費由八元增為十二元云。」</p>
<p>上海市無人撫育有待寄托的兒童，何止十萬？然而該所僅能容納此數，而此數又可斷言其無一是來自勞動羣。那麼勞動羣的兒童，不是累了他們的母親不得分身而同歸於盡，便是蟲一樣地任他們爬行，流浪，死亡；現今我國兒童的死亡率，巳經和亡國民族的印度並居肢高的數目，我們可以想得到是多麽危險！然而社會對牠的淡漠，可以說是無可更淡漢。</p>
<p>可是另一方社會却在極力重視結婚，各省各市，惟恐曠夫怨女不甯，故極力帮助他們得到幸福，而推行便利省節的集團結婚制。自去歲上海市開倡以來，天津，南京，廣州，杭州，鎭江，開封，相繼施行，大有普遍全國之勢。每屆結婚時新人們的翩翩艷影，和長官們參加的盛大的儀式，眞使人興趣橫生，躍躍欲試。體育雖曰救國，但每日每萬平均的觀衆，决不能和每屆集團結婚的盛况比並。若有誰人道出這是「結婚運動」，想來也不會遭着反對。流風所及，使七十老翁也勃然興起。至於社會之虎視耿耽於某明星的結婚，某泳星的訂婚，某球星的戀愛，更是風氣之末了。</p>
<p>結婚本是重要的生活的一宗，社會對之重視，自有其相當的理由。但數千年傳統的思潮，巳呌女子將結婚視為唯一的終身大事——除此以外別無大事。而近頃受不景氣的惡濤，婚姻市塲上男子的購買力非常薄弱，待嫁的小姐姑娘，比比皆是；她們平時已經受彀了傷春悲秋的苦處，怎經得起集團結婚的强烈的刺激？事情現雖未曾表面化，然暗中枯萎於此的想大有人在。社會旣沒有使她們將精神移注於他方的動力，她們平白地所增加的愁思，却是寃寃枉枉。</p>
<p>若是放開眼光來說，結婚只是男女兩人的私事，社會無對他們捧塲，喝彩，帮忙，凑趣的必要。若以用於這方面的熱心，以及時間，經濟，精力，移用於托兒所上面，社會所受的福利豈長淺鮮？而且這一來轉移大衆的目光，使人知道重其所重，而輕其所輕，則民族前途，也可以撥開一層暗淡；社會的風化，以及怨女的焦憂，都可調整不少了。</p>
<h3 id="c192">如此慈善產院 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 茜</p>
<p>——在門診室——</p>
<p>好像只要是人，誰都會說：「生男育女是婦女的天職，」可是不管天職也好，地職也好，嘴里儘管說得神怪重要，但如何使婦女安全地完成這種職任，却很少有人來管這些鳥事。近年來，雖間或也有受了科學洗禮以及端了產科飯碗的人，在報端上吶喊這麽一兩聲，要女人們切不可再受收生婆的毒害，一定要入產院；但產院的設備，究竟到了若何程度，產院收生對於產婦與產兒性命的安全，以及產婦住院所受的待遇是否健全等等，却從來無人提及。</p>
<p>話須得說回來，本文所要提到的幾個產院以及院內的情形，當然不是那些闊老們花幾百或上千的銀子所住的地方，（據可靠的消息，某都長的太太生產，是請的某大醫院的院長接生，收生費紋銀一千兩云）；反之，旣名曰「慈善」，乃是有錢人為窮人開方便之門的地方。這兒要提到的慈善產院，全是帝國主義者們作為文化侵略的途徑之一的帶宗敎性的慈善醫院中的產院部。</p>
<p>上海比較完善的私立的產院儘管多，但經濟力的缺乏，却褫奪了窮孕婦們選擇醫生與產院的自由，面有些窮孕婦腦子里的知識又阻止她們去信任收生婆，因此在產前的一二月中，她們只得挺着便便大腹定上了最後的一條路—即是釗宗敎家辦的慈善產院去碰自己的運氣了。</p>
<p>筆者也是快要盡「天職」的女人中之一，而這種「天職」，我現在是盡第三次了。過去的經過與所見過的危險與恐怖，現在又時時警惕着我早作第三次的準備。像我們這些時常為竊神所追隨的人，雖曾在慈善產院吃過大虧，但這一次，仍只好去叩天國的鬥，希望上帝有良心，給我碰着的醫生與看護是　職而有人性的。</p>
<p>就這麽着，我像袋鼠似的腹內揣着七個月的胎兒，淸晨八時半走進了上海的一家最大的慈善醫院。三百文掛號下來，已是九時半了。章程上雖明定的婦產科施診時間是上午十時至十一時，可是到了十點三刻尙未見醫生的影兒。擠滿大肚皮與婦科病人的一聞狹小的候診室內，還參進了一個背一大袋怪書邊求售邊宣敎的老頭子，他嘴里不斷地喃喃着什麽「天國近了」等等鬼話。但委實也是「天國近了」，因為馬上就有一位大醫生神氣十足地走進了施診室，他後面還緊跟着一個穿着華麗的時髦女子。大家心里眼里頓時閃亮起來，以爲馬上司以遇救了；誰知約莫一刻鐘以後，大醫生和時髦女子又一前一後神氣十足地走出了施診室。這時在施診室鬥口佇候多時的一個中年婦人，抑着性子低聲詢間看護婦道：「小姐，醫生為什麽不看我呢？我是一號呀。」滿臉雀斑，並有些潑婦樣的看護婦不屑地叱道：「醫生還沒有來呢，那是×醫生自己的病人，懂得了嗎？</p>
<p>我正在狐疑何謂「醫生自己的病人」時，出在我旁邊的一位大肚皮告訴我說：「這個×醫生是個混蛋，前年我懷着第二個孩子來檢察時正碰着他，他不要臉乘着看護婦不在，捻我的大腿，我很很給過他一把掌。」</p>
<p>我們正在這樣談講，門外走進了幾位闊太太，且隨帶有幾個娘姨模樣的人，接着又走進了兩位穿制服的練習女醫生。鼓噪着的人們，又漸次甯靜下去，各人都拿全副精神，注視施診室。</p>
<p>不久，施診室果然像加了煤的洪爐，大大吒盛起來，可是先被喚去受診的，却是闊太太們帶來的那幾個娘姨模樣的人。仔細一打聽，才知道她們都是太太們花了特別號金二元，騐血費五元來受檢查的出賣鮮血的奶娘。</p>
<p>一直弄到十二點已敲過，好容易我被那個潑婦樣的看護婦喚進了施診室。七個月的孕婦第一次受產醫檢驗，竟沒花上三分鐘，而一切手續都告完竟，走出產院的門，我自己還在希奇。但有一件事，我是淸淸楚楚看見了的；那是呌我撒下去騐的小便，就在那個便盆內，也就在我那泡小便上，一個婦科病人接着也去撒過小便的。這種潦草塞責的門診，立時勾起了我以前在產院所見的恐怖景象，我眞個在大熱大里打起了個寒顫！</p>

<p>— 湛泉</p>
<p>河身轉了彎，愈遠愈顯小巧的櫓尾，隨着也終於消失在視綫之外。帶着憤然凝望的眼光，用勁地注視着這長長一片被船身櫓片劃破得晃動不定的波流，似乎要責難它為甚一夏天乾巴巴的肚皮朝天，乾殺了田裏的禾稻，乾沒了大家的活路；現在却又汨汨湯湯地汆着船兒載走了一去不回的女兒，無法遏制，而又無法排除的一肚皮惱苦，使得順姑的娘開始意識到這樣咀咒意味的幼穉的發曳。</p>
<p>左近人家都還很少聲息。自家的門虛掩着。門前一片曠地上，淡淡地照臨着一片初日的光輝。想到此後永遠不會再現的一張翹着小辮，東跳西蹦的活動影片時，心頭益發沉重到靴以描話。茫然地推進門茫然地倒在一只破椅上；再也强忍不住的一陣嚎啕，立刻震動了小屋裏冷寂的空氣，也驚動了左隣右舍同命運好心腸的人們</p>
<p>「順姑今天送去了？……看開些啊！家裏少穿沒吃的，外邊去到底活了她一條命。况且三十幾塊錢也不算一個小數目，另外再拚凑點，也接得上「春花」熟了。全家餓起來到底不是事；而况你家終也背上那一筆租錢？……」</p>
<p>「是呀，這年頭誰不苦命？阿玉嫂不是前兒也賣掉她乖巧的阿翠？炳老爹也出脫了多年作伴的那只茁壯的耕牛。沒兒女沒畜牲的，誰又不把缺不來離不了的傢伙弄個一乾二净？唉，這有什麼法子呢！」</p>
<p>「眞的，老天爺要我們吃苦，有什麼說的！你忘記了阿良哥把才落地的毛頭也挑出去換了一塊錢？養到七八歲，也對得她起了。爲了自己活命，沒辦法啊！</p>
<p>「唉，是做小尼姑去呀！還沒有正經地做過一日人，就寃寃枉枉地送進空門，這不是活造孽？將來她大起來懂了人事，也得怨爹娘狠心。可憐她還當眞是上省城去玩，有說有笑的在船頭上，一路對我招手兒！</p>
<p>「况且，越是吃素念佛的人，越是量氣窄，心陽狠，保不定落在朝夜打駡的惡運裏，不眞苦煞了順姑？」</p>
<p>肥頭胖腦的面影浮上腦海來，淸晰地，那上面，嵌着一付炯炯有光的精悍的眼睛。三天前全家同上省城到那個尼庵去當面交涉時，最使她不願成交的理由，就是這尼姑的相貌外善內奸，怕順姑受不了她的折磨。然而為了錢，婆婆答應了，丈夫情願了，自己就再多說，也只多領敎一番解釋生活的大道理。毫無辦法地等待着等於死別的生離的來到，幾日來，就只有帶着順姑一步不離的直到今朝。</p>
<p>然而現在是兩手騰空了，想到此後工作餘閑，再不會得到那種天眞可愛的慰伴，一陣更劇的痛心，聯帶記起了去年春天下地就死的小兒子。—因為產後發熱，乾了乳汁，沒錢抱出去搭奶，又吃不起什麽牛奶豆漿，生活本領還很欠缺的嬰孩，終于活活地在半個月上餓死了。</p>
<p>帶抽噎帶述訴的低哀，又一轉而爲猛厲的凄號。這單獨的個人的哭，包羅了普遍的大衆的苦辛；這使得同伴們於頻頻解勸之中，禁不住頻頻嘆息，頻頻拭淚，各人悲傷著各人的却是普遍的同樣的命運。</p>
<p>然而時間于她們，不像某一種人的可以隨意浪費；終于，大家想到還得用自己的筋肉與命運繼續相搏鬬，急急地致了最後的懇勸，陸續同去幹自己的生涯。</p>
<p>雜亂而稔熟的一串脚步聲停止在門前，風快地推開了半掩著的柴門，帶進了一縷還很有勁的斜日。在耀眼的陽光裏，跳近到母親身邊來的，不正是幾日來為她絞斷肝腸，半天裏為她哭燥雙睛的順姑？</p>
<p>靜默和驚奇佔領了一瞬間。終于，帶著悻悻的口氣，丈夫像自己雷怒，又像對誰訴述似的把交易拆散的經過和盤說出</p>

<h3 id="c194">第十講　婦女解放思想的史的考察 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>第一節　民主主義的婦女解放思想</p>
<p>我們知道，所謂民主主義或自由主義是近代的市民階級要打破封建專制主義的最有效的工具。就是說，當市民階級在封建社會的廢圩上打定基礎的時候，舉起了民主主義的旗子，號召封建制度下的被壓迫大衆，於是被壓迫婦女大衆也很勇敢的集中到民主主義的反封建的陣營來！這樣她們便自覺地開始要求婦女在社會上和男子平等的權利。又這樣就形成了民主主義的婦女解放思想。</p>
<p>這種民主主義的解放思想遂產生了所謂飛米尼斯主義（Feminism）。飛米尼期主義可譯作女權主義或男女同權主義。關於牠的意義，許多人有不同的解說，但概括賈之，就是在資本主義社會制度底下，要獲得和男子平等的權利。換言之，女權主義者是不反對財產私有制及階級支配的存在，而只反對男子對女子的支配權，不要改變現社會制度，而只要求和男子同權，又只認定男女兩性的對立，而否認社會階級的對立。這種思想，本質上就是資產階級民主主義或自由主義思想的產物，是代表當時正在解放渦稈中的資產階級婦女的思想。</p>
<p>女權主義的思想，可以說是發源於　梭的一民約說」，但是十八世紀法國大革命時代辜傑和羅蘭夫人所發表的「婦女權利宣言」乃是這思想的最初的具體的表演。又有同時候，即一七九二年英國的華爾斯登格拉夫脫女士發表「女權擁護論」一書，更具體的要求婦女在社會上和男子同等的權利，女權主義的雛形遂被完成，而且廣汎的傳播到歐美各國。因此，世稱華爾斯登格拉夫脫為女權主義的鼻祖。</p>
<p>其後到十九世紀中葉，隨着資產階級民主政櫬的確立與發達，女權主義思想遂布滿於歐美各國。此種思想的代表的人物，可算是英國的約翰科勒，美國的須林娜及紀爾曼，瑞典的愛倫凱。他們關於婦女見解本不一致。舉例說，穆勒是熱心的婦女參政權運動者，他在其名著「婦女的服從」一書中特別重視婦女在法律上的地位，即他是主要的從法律的見地去論究婦女解放問題。須林娜去人著述「婦女與勞動」一書，主要的從勞動的觀點去說明婦女的解放。紀爾曼夫人是著「婦女與經濟」一書，主要的從經濟的見地去究明婦女問題。最後愛倫凱著述「兒童卅紀」，「戀愛與結婚」，「婦女運動」，「母性的復興」等諸書，提倡母性萬能主義及戀愛是至上主義，而要從兩性的見地去解决婦女問題。在此因篇幅關係，不能詳述他們的具體意見，但總之他們同為女權主義者，其思想並不曾統一，換言之，所謂女權主義思想，本來沒有何等獨立的統一的體系。</p>
<p>不過。在這裏有一點特別要注意，就是愛倫凱的盡愛觀和母性觀是常被人們惡意利用的。她是主張保護母性，主張母性的獨特的自由，爲的是自由的選擇戀愛及結婚，充分發揮母性的性的能力。他說；「現在一切的努力是在作製造更優良的人種的準備，那是亨樂戀愛的大動力，除了戀愛及親子之愛以外，這個動力是沒有的」。爲了創造更優良的人種，須等待母性的完成，婦女有要求完成這母性的權利，社會也當然要負有這義務的。她是主張婦女為妻為母的天職，而反對婦女就家庭外的勞動，或奔走於政治運動。她說：</p>
<p>「如果女性除了從事家庭外的勞動以外，不能脫去從來的寄生的生活狀態，那麽我們寧願從夾那種高生的生活。因為這兩個社會惡之中，後者爲害較前者少。」</p>
<p>愛倫　的這種思想是和一般女權主義者的主張背道而馳。詳言之，是述英美的女描主義者是反對寄生的爲妻為母的生活，而主張婦女深入社會中去作同男子一樣的活勁。但愛倫則是站在種族的優生學的見他，重視家庭及眞正的戀愛結婚生活，主張母性的特權，反對媂女在職業上及政治上的活動。這種主張在目前正是適合于一切復古主義者的胃口。</p>
<p>實際上愛倫凱的思想是英美的女權運動的反動的表現。當資本主義的經濟組織破壞從來的家族的生活，而多數婦女不得不去參加家庭外的社會勞動的時候，英美的婦女是積極的向社會各方面去要求其生存權，這樣成了英美婦女的熱烈的參政運動及職業運動。可是從愛倫凱看來，這種現象是破壞家庭，忽視女性的爲妻爲母的大賦的使命，更使兩性關係變成金錢的交易關係而沒有所謂純眞的戀愛結婿生活。因此愛倫凱是特別强調純眞的戀愛和母性保護。</p>
<p>總而言之，女權主義思想是資產階級民主思想的一分野。牠雖然沒有一定的統一的系統，但對于反對撤廢財產私有制，及階級鬬爭這點倒是一致的。這種思想，在現在已經完全失去了牠的社會的實際的意義</p>

<h3 id="c205">英法合作問題 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 西如</p>
<p>東菲的砲聲，每一響都要震動不列顚帝國的心靈。那是因為意大利如果打平了阿比西尼亞，那不僅英國在菲洲的殖民地要感受直接的威脅，其由地中海到遠東的航綫亦將有隨時被截斷的可能，從而大英帝國便有解體的危險。所以，自莫梭里尼向阿發的第一砲的響聲傳出後，倫敦空氣卽格外緊張，英國政府除繼續佈防地中海外，同時更加緊在日內瓦活動，要國聯决議認意大利為侵略國，對牠實施制裁。但是，要以有效的辦法對付意大利，在目前局勢下英國是不敢單獨去冒險的，它至少也要在法國的相當諒解之下才敢有所行動。因此，自東菲事件發生後，艾登卽奔走於巴黎倫敦與日內瓦之間，要求法人贊助其制裁意大利，面英法合作的聲浪也就日益高漲起來了。</p>
<p>本來英法的外交同是挾國聯以自重的。但在目前英國的注意力是集中在地中海，而法國則注視着萊茵河。所以，當英國向法要求制裁意大利時，法國即反問英人將來如中歐有事時英國是否對侵略者加以同樣的制裁；當英國要求在地中海上法國的海軍援助時，法國又要求英國海陸空軍的合作；在這樣討價還價的交涉中，英法是獲得了相當的諒解，漸漸接近了。現在，國聯已通過了對意制裁的議案，法國已答覆了海軍援英問題，同時意阿停戰談判也在進行了，於是有些過分樂觀的人就說和平的曙光已經出現，戰禍可能免除了。</p>
<p>不錯，在和戰問題上英法的關係是有重大作用的；如果英法眞能合作，一致壓迫莫梭里尼，也許有使意大利「適可而止」的可能。但就目前形勢看來，若謂英法在某些點上已獲相當諒解則可；如說英法已經澈底合作了，那便是過早的論斷。我們以為英法只有在維護國聯的存在上，在維持歐洲一時的安定一點上才能一致，因而法國只能設法使意大利「適可而上」，英國也只能在一般安全保障問題上才能對法負責；一說到眞正共同對意或共同對德問題，那便很難了。因為要英國完全犧牲由倫敦海軍協定所獲得的英德諒解，要法國自行撕碎法意羅馬協定，都是不易成為現實的。事實上，最近法國與英的覆文，也只是表示如英國海軍遭受意海軍無理的攻擊時，法海軍才能給與援助；反之，若英海軍要攻擊意大利，實行軍事制裁時，那在法人便　　　問題了。至於制裁問題，法國僅表示同意實行經濟制裁，此外如關於封鎖蘇彝士運河或封鎖意國海口等問題，則牠「並未考慮及之」。同樣，對於共同防德的法國的要求，倫敦方面也未作切實的答復，最近英首相包爾溫與外相霍爾所發的言論，也是一些「維護盟約」「保持和平」等空洞之談，並未對法國的要求有切實的表示。在霍爾的演說中，曾有這樣一段值得玩味的內容：「吾人目前所作之偉大試騐，實為全世界數代未有之舉，集體安全之機構，今乃第一次見諸試行矣。苟試行而得其道，吾人固不難坐視其成效；試行而不得道，則凡主張不以戰爭為國家工具者，必咸將感受失望之重大打擊矣。苟此種試驗竟遭失敗，則凡抱動搖不定之態度以參加行動者，實應負重大之責任。……忠實擁護集體安全制度者誰，口頭高呼擁護集體安全制度，而對於實施集體安全之國家反加以攻擊及挑釁者又為誰，吾人其庶幾有所識別焉。」這言外之意，已顯然若揭了。——由此我們可以說在目前形勢之下，所謂英法合作，是有限度的。</p>
<p>自然，就是這樣的限度的英法合作對於歐洲局勢也有很大的影響。很顯然的，由於法國的參加經濟制裁，有條件地在地中海給與英人以海軍援助，已使莫梭里尼感到形勢沒有好多把握了。雖說因為日美與德國站立在國聯之外，因為歐洲各國的利害不同，所謂經濟制裁的功效是有限的，但是，意大利在遠征東非中財政已虧耗了萬三千餘萬里拉，其經濟政治的危機正在發展，在此情形下，就是英法所能做到的經濟制裁，對牠也是一個重大的打擊。所以，莫梭里尼才於此時軍事外交同時進行，一面備戰，一面提出停戰條件進行談判，以圖緩和局勢。據一般觀察，倘使英法合作能繼續發展，則意大利所提的條件便有逐漸降低的可能，因而東非問題或可得到一時的解决。這樣的可能當然是有的。不過，這一可能要成為現實，也不是短時期內的事情；如果問題解决的時間延長至數月或一年之久，則夜長夢多，其結果仍是不可預測的。</p>
<p>更進一步說，卽使英法能進一步地合作，歐洲形勢也不能作簡單而樂觀的估計。第一，法蘇現在正很親善，而英國向來又是反蘇戰綫的組織者，如果英法更進一步合作，那英國是否因此就與蘇聯親善，乃是一個很大的問題。英國之拉法，不一定就是要親俄，英國之度意，不一定就要反德；同樣，法國之與英合作，不一定就是要反意乃至反俄，更不一定就要親德；就在牠們的合作聲中也都是各有懷抱的。英國所想的，是要通過法國以緩和英意的衝突，努力調解法德的矛盾，嗾使德國東進；法國的企圖則是聯英同時也拉住蘇聯和意大利以防德國，但這兩個企圖顯然是衝突的。第二，倘使英法能進一步地合作，則必促使德意携手，從而更形成德意奧匈波蘭的結合，成為歐洲的新的集團力量。那時英法乃至蘇聯能否如戰前一樣聯合起來，與德意等對抗，重演一九一四年所發生的慘劇，也是頗成問題的。所以，第三，卽使英法能進一步地合作，其前途仍很難說；而歐洲局勢之變化仍是不能作簡單的論斷的。</p>
<p>但是，不管怎樣，我們都可以說世界第二次大戰的危機依然很大；而且，這危機之成為現實，誰也不能說還要經過好久的時間。依目前形勢看來，意阿問題就不是短期內所能解決的；即使英法能在一定限度內合作，迫使意大利「適可而止」，使東菲問題能得到一時的和緩或暫時的解决，戰禍也要很快地在別的地方在別的問題上爆發起來。在奧大利，在波羅也每，在巴爾幹，在遠東，……世界到處都是火藥庫啊！當上次世界大戰快爆發時，列强都拚命擴充軍備，於是那時就有人問：那些武器是用來對誰的呀？現在列强的軍備在質量上都要高過上次大戰時好多倍，在這時你能不會發生那些武器是用來對誰的問題嗎？</p>

<p>拉鼓會在苗民的各種神會中最爲重要，其儀式也較其他的神會為隆重盛大；其所需經費也很浩大，常是要窮集整個或一部份的苗族的財物才能舉辦這一種盛典。這事在我們看來，似乎是荒誕無聊耗財費神的愚蠢舉動，但在他們却認為是關係種族的盛衰和年成的豐歉，雖窮困到連吃飯也成問題，都還是要如期舉行；由此我們可以想見現在能够支配苗民的生活意識的，還不是二十世紀的科學而是神權。</p>
<p>舉行「拉鼓會」的費用雖很浩大，但幸虧是每隔十三年才有一次，每次舉行時期大都在一年中的十一月前後。當會期快到時，便由各村熱心的老苗民籌備一切，採辦猪牛食物。每一次會中所需的猪牛，從十數頭到幾十頭不等；有時即使遇某一村沒有這麽大的財力來備辦這大宗祭品，但為了要預祝豐年，村民們也不得不節衣縮食來忍痛犧牲。等到舉行盛會的第一天，便由各村公選出首當二人，中富十數人來領頭主祭；首常每一個人要獻出水生十二三頭，中富則每人一頭，成數人共出一頭。一切籌備手續完成了，便由出頭籌備的幾個老苗民通知各村，何日來參加舉行祭典。</p>
<p>在舉行盛會的那天，先在有河流的地方找好一處寬大的沙泥坪，在那裏設臥床一張，床的四圍，滿掛許多魚·烏·蟲和老鼠等等動物的岡畫，佈置得像廟裏一座神龕。這時，由出祭品最多的富翁睡到床上，仰臥着身體，口眼緊閉，屏聲靜氣得像一個死人，絲毫不准抽動；這樣，會衆便認為他是「黑狗」——註：見後叙述——的化身，於是歡聲雷動，殺牛宰猪，焚香慶祝起來。一切的生肉祭物和霧似的香烟，便圍繞着那偽死者——富翁——的四週；同時還有幾千人的氣息對他冲着，但那富翁雖處在這樣的環境中還是不准動彈一下。</p>
<p>會衆等上祭之後，便取一株「斗飛遙」樹—註：苗語譯音，詳見後—，長可數丈或數尺，視人數的多寡而定；把樹心挖通，通過一條粗實的長繩，兩端再結上無數的小繩，凡參與的會衆不分男女老幼的每人都手執一繩，彼此對拉起來。那種情形彷彿和內地的建築工人打椿相似。甲乙兩端往還拉動，嘴裏一致的高聲呼唱着，瘋狂的情緒充滿了整個的會塲，這便是「拉鼓」的一幕。在進行「拉鼓」時，另有二三百人吹奏「蘆笙」助興，從早到晚，整整的一天都在歡忻鼓舞的情緒中過着。可是，苦的却是那位當翁，當會衆狂歡到極頂時，他還是像死人似的一動也不敢動，否則，這個種族興降所繫的「拉鼓」便會會　壞，而全苗人的生命也就凶多吉少了！</p>
<p>這樣，直到薄暮時分，大家都感到過度興奮後的疲倦和飢餓，「拉鼓」才宣告終止；大家便都聚在神—富翁—前烹煮猪牛肉充飢，剩下來的再由次富翁主持瓜分給各人帶了回去。至於那個裝死的富翁，則要到會衆走盡，才能從床上爬起來回去吃點東西；等到三天的神會儀式終了，這一個裝死的富翁就是不死也得生一塲大病，甚至由裝死而眞死了的事也是常有的。這種舉動雖屬愚蠢，但被選出的富翁却並不拒絕；因為他們認為能這樣在床上死去，便是與神同化了，在他們正是求之不得的光榮！</p>
<p>「拉鼓會」三天終了，各參與的會衆都要彼此登門道賀，慶祝發財發福：做主人的便要殺猪宰牛，請客人大吃大喝幾天。一般靑年男女平時因了禮敎的防範不得親近，但在這幾天中卻儘可公開地大演其喜劇；家長就是看在眼裏也不加責備，有時還帮忙促使成功。所以苗人的靑年男女都很希望「拉鼓會」常常舉行，使他們得從中成其好事；祇是可惜要經過十三年才能舉行一次，却不能不認為是他們的一件憾事！</p>
<p>「拉鼓會」舉行後的第三十日，呌做「滿月」；這天由各村的苗民虔誠地把那株「斗飛遙」樹送上山去，舉行一番膜拜頂禮，於是這整個神會儀式才算告終了。</p>
<p>說起這「拉鼓會」的來歷，簡直就是一篇神話故事，據一個苗民說：「從前有一位唐王，生有幾個女兒，就中要算第二個女兒長得最為漂亮，性情又十分腎淑，所以唐王對她特別的鍾愛。過了幾年，這幾個女兒都長大成人，先後出了嫁，祗有迢第二的因唐王鍾愛她，還留在身邊。</p>
<p>有一次，賊業犯境，唐王戰敗回來，就馬上收拾家產，率領家人逃難過海；但因臨行忽促，却把一顆傳國的玉璽忘記帶出來。唐王從此終日鬰悶不樂，懊惱非常，心裏總念念不忘那顆玉璽。後來有一天，遇見了閻王，他便把丟失玉璽的事請閻王設法，可是閻王也無法可想。兩個人相對無言，默默沉思了半天，後來還是他自己想了僩主意，就告訴閻王說：「我想懸一紙賞格，如果有人能渡海取回我的玉璽，無論他是怎樣的一種人，或者竟是一隻猪狗都可以匹配我的女兒。」</p>
<p>閻王聽了亳不作聲，祗斜着眼睛看了看他，却不料閻王牽來的一匹黑狗聽了他的話，心裏便打定主意要去取回玉璽，好娶那位美人。果然，在閻王牽牠回去之後，牠就不洩漏一點聲息，逕自啣一根幾尺長的木棍渡海而去。在海中漂浮了幾天，費盡許多氣力，總算抵岸了。牠抬頭一看，祇見唐主故都還住有不少的賊衆；牠想了一想：這次取玉璽祗可由智取，不能以力敵。牠先從聯絡同類感情入手；整天跟着牠們逛東逛西，日子久了，彼此感情就漸漸融洽起來，唐王的宮殿也因有牠們作嚮導熟記在肚子裏了。</p>
<p>一天，牠邀集了幾個同伴走到唐主的宮中，東游西蕩地暗自找尋存放玉璽的所在，遇見了食物使請同伴的去吃；一般賊衆把牠富作平常的狗看待，毫不介意的由牠自由走動。這樣，直到天色黑了下來，牠突然看到一張長大的案上放着强烈的光芒，照滿了全屋；牠心裏不由得一動，便信步朝着光芒那裏走去，及至跟前，一看果然就是唐王所想念的玉璽。牠一時歡喜極了，就偷偷地攢到案底下伏着，屏聲靜氣地約摸過了幾個時辰。牠放眼一看，見賊業都睡熟了，便朝案上一躍，把玉璽啣在嘴裏，悄悄地溜出了賊業的範圍。</p>
<p>幾天之後，牠平安地渡過了海，把玉璽送到唐王跟前，唐王低頭一看，頓時驚得說不出話來。這時，閻王也聞訊走來，向唐王道賀一番；可是，唐王却憂喜交集，一時想不出主意來。後來，他的第二女兒聽見了這個消息，便趕過來解除父親的痛苦，一口答應了父親所出的賞格。</p>
<p>她和黑狗成婚之後，唐主賜給她幾畝田，呌她種樹過活；黑狗日裏躺在她身邊，夜間則儼如夫妻在一塊兒睡覺，隔了一年，居然生了一個孩子。唐王聞訊，喜悅非常，派人送了許多斧頭和一百多把禾把（苗人禾穗都束成把，每把約三四斤）算作禮物，牠倆從此也更加喜悅地過着無憂無慮的生活。可是，好景不常，終究成了牠們的譏語！一天，突然有許多人帶了不少的獵狗，到牠們住的附近山上趕山（即打獵），聲聲犬吠，震動山谷。黑狗聽了趕山的犬聲，異常感動，也跟着牠們去趕山。不料走到一處削壁懸崖的旁邊，忽然一個不留心，失足跌了下去，凑巧在那懸壁中間長了一株「斗飛遙」樹，黑狗就掛住在這樹槎裏。</p>
<p>唐王的第二個女兒見牠一去不回，心知凶多吉少，但沒有方法去打聽牠的下落，心裏自是說不出的悲痛；附近一帶的苗民聽到了這不幸的消息，也都替她惋惜不巳！</p>
<p>黑狗死後，由於如勤愼的操作，家道一天天興旺起來，兒子也一天比一天大了；母子兩人，過着風平浪靜的生活。一天，兒子記起父親的慘死，便到父親「趕山」的山谷中去找牠的遺骸；費了幾天的工夫，終於給他在懸崖間的一顆樹槎裏發現了父親的一副鮮紅的骸骨。這個奇怪的消息頓時傳遍了苗人的村落，大家認為這副骸骨能够不腐和牠的兒子能够發財，都是這「斗飛遙」樹的靈性；於是，一般苗民便爭先恐後的冒着生命的危險，把那顆樹砍下來扛了回去，把樹心挖空，用繩穿了起來，當作神祗般的供奉着。凑巧，牠兒子找尋牠的遺骸那年正是十三歲，因此一般苗民便每隔十三年就舉行一次「拉鼓會。」</p>
<p>這一段故事的荒誕神奇自不必說，但是一般苗民舉行這會的動機，却也和已開化的人所抱的思想一樣的還是離不了為想「發財」！</p>

<p>— 屈嘉</p>
<p>記得去年本報曾經刊過關於「業餘時間要否學習一種外國語」問題的文字，當時並沒有被一個缺乏業餘時間而讀書慾旺盛的做小夥計的我所忽視。因為發表的文章不祇一篇，意見亦人異言殊，好叫我一時頗難適從。首先我就接受編輯先生的意見，决定先讀一些基礎知識的書籍，把外國語摒棄不學，結果可稱良好。不過在好像稍微獲得了一些基礎知識的時候，馬上發覺了所獲得的知識過分淺薄而感到以後的進步很慢。理應聲明的，這並不是我年紀一大，心思入野，祗是我個人所研究的是社會科學，懂得一些科學的理論，要是沒有事實來做例證，那就無異於讀死書，試問積而不化又有何用？那時我回頭想學外國語。我認爲英文是比較通用，假如能看看國外的雜誌報章，也可以多曉得一些世界大事。英文，我從前在小學校裏曾一度接觸過，知道牠難，但是一想到「難之一字惟愚人之字典有之」一語，勇氣有則决心下矣。從此用功學習，口中常念念不休。不料半年學過，成績未見。那時想到去學世界語。不過有的朋友以為我「見異思遷」，結果必一無成就，但是為時不出三月，居然進步很快，我想這應當歸功於世界語的簡單易學，倘若它不能使我達到閱讀雜誌報章的目的，半途而廢是可能的。</p>
<p>從前，我不知道薩爾這麼一個小地方，後來在世界讀雜誌中讀到一篇薩爾通信，才知道它在地理上的位置及其重要之所在。到了薩爾區域投票的時候。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>關於薩爾問題的內容中文報上宣登出來，那時對於我祇能算作舊聞。近來中文報上連日刊載意阿的戰訊，可是我在世界語通信中却知之較詳。關於文化的消息，如前次在申報和大晚報見到「第二十七次國際世界語大會於八月間在羅馬舉行，中敎都電駐義公使派員就近參加，屆時將由墨索利尼代表任臨時主席云云」的新聞，此事因事關世運，恕我亦早已蟯得，並且不僅如此，因爲中文報上却未曾說起大會還有旅行菲洲的壯舉呢！凡此種種，足證世界語之消息靈通，然而它所啟示於人們的又何止於此？</p>
<p>英文之「難」，固然令人做一個「愚人」，如今把握一種精美易學的語文，則無從再呌我「見異」而「思遷」了。假使學世界語容易就是「行易」，要知道學世界語是那麽容易這般有用爲「知難」的話，我願把這個難得知道的事給大家一齊知道。</p>

<h3 id="c208">評「都市風光」 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 明耀</p>
<p>「都市風光」這部片子不成問題的是以嶄新的姿態，從國產影片中辦出頭角；不單是編導方面採取新的方式和技巧，而且還「用音樂來描寫劇中人的動作，心理變化，以及劇的塲面的移換」，牠是所謂創一格的「新型樂劇」。</p>
<p>國產聲片說來已有長足的進步，但終因歷史的淺短，最多不過在對白，或歌曲上有所成就，還談不到「音樂鉅片」，更無所謂「聲影藝術」了！然而電影藝術終需嬰努力催促牠進步，纔能描寫目前的複雜的社會環境，迎合觀衆的需要。這次電通公司竟以嘗試的態度作成這部新型樂劇，這種勇敢和努力的精神是值得佩服的。</p>
<p>現在爲了敘述明瞭起見，特將故事簡略的介紹如下：</p>
<p>「某鄉小車站，有農民棄農具羣趨上海，候車時有玩西洋鏡者（袁牧之飾）唱歌　攬生意，於是有父，母，女，甥四人往觀。鏡中所映爲「都市風光」：都市中靑年李夢華（唐納飾）是個沒錢的「無名文人」，却戀愛着一個家道不好而又偏愛修飾的摩登小姐張小雲（張新珠飾）。張另有愛人王俊三（顧夢鶴飾）爲略有資財的茶棧經理，平素專喜玩弄女性，空裝闊塲面。女父（周伯勳飾）爲押店股東之一，家庭經濟十分窘迫，故常向押店要錢，而押店生意又不好，以致屢次碰壁，最後連別人所押的東西都拿在自己家裏充過年之用。後來李夢華因金錢不敵，小雲被俊三奪去。然俊三因爲平素假裝闊綽，以致用度很多，兼之生意虧本，年關前債主臨門催逼，於是棄小雲而悄然逃走。待小雲及其父發覺，追到車站時，車已開了。西洋鏡中的「都市風光」便從此終止。看西洋鏡的父，母，女，甥四人掉轉頭來，纔記起自己是趕車到上海的。這時有兩部車將分頭開去，但他們不知何所適從，結果，在他們慌忙拉扯中兩車都開走了！」</p>
<p>故事很簡單，幾乎一貫是戀愛，其實可說全是幾個不正經的男女糾糾纏纏作爲全劇的綫索。只因爲造新的技巧描寫，却顯得新鮮活潑，兼之有音樂帮助劇中人的動作和心理變化的描寫，更覺輕鬆爽快。不成問題的，「都市風光「是一幕滑稽的喜劇，看了過後確能使你「從頭笑到底」，然而牠却並不像過去的戀部「滑稽片子」那麼無中生有，裝腔作勢，打打鬧鬧的「滑稽」，牠是抓着現實做題材，從反面以幽默的諷刺的方法去描畫的。譬如西洋鏡者一露面時那副不尷不尬的扮相，很引起你的笑意，但當他打起沙聲唱着生意歌，你的「笑」便給那凄凉的音調染得酸溜溜的了。又譬如看西洋鏡的四人，臨到車開時那種慌張的東扯西扯的態度，使人看了覺得很好笑，但想到這些男女，離了農村，又不能鐟進罪惡的城市，那種「不知適從」的情形，又覺得有一股酸味湧上心頭！</p>
<p>劇作者給「都市風光」的意義是揭露都市中的罪惡和醜態，因此片中有賣風騎講摩登的媚人的狐狸精（張小雲），有玩弄女性裝闊綽的洋塲惡少（王俊三），有謟媚吹捧的篾片，走狗（王俊三的秘書陳秘書），有不求長進的以戀愛爲至上主義的智識靑年（李夢華……這幾種人型都是都市中常見着的。劇作者抓住這幾種人型作有力的諷刺和嘲笑，於是「戀愛至上主義者」終給別人一脚踢開，「擺空架子者」終歸坍台，羨慕虛榮的摩登小姐竟弄得景態凄凉，其中尤以戀愛至上主義者遭受苛刻的嘲笑：沒名譽沒金錢的窮文人李夢華，不從自己所走道路求長進，却偏偏以戀愛爲常事，而且還追逐那虛榮心很重的摩登女子，於是有拖欠房錢給愛人買裝飾品，當懊錶進舞塲，錯把當票給門券的各種窘狀，眞是笑話百出，醜態畢露，這神諷刺是應該，而且楚很合情理的。</p>
<p>這些都是都市的罪惡和醜態，然而牠底外表是很可觀的，正如西洋鏡不能拆穿一樣。劇作者利用這「西洋鏡」來看透「都市風光」中的各種形態，技巧的運用可說是很靈便的。當那候車的四人的眼睛接觸到西洋鏡時，都市巍峨矗立的建築，咆哮奔撲的汽車，……都明白的從眼邊溜過，好像是很堂皇很熱鬧的天堂，然而最後的接觸却是罪惡的魔窟，全是醜惡的人們在那兒活動，於是對於都市的幻想便都失掉了。</p>
<p>全部劇情都很緊凑，一貫的可以抓住觀衆的情緒，始終都是想笑，要笑，微笑，大笑，同時因有了配置得合乎劇情的音樂，更增加了不少的力量，这是「新型樂劇」較其他的「滑稽片」或「普樂片」優越的地方。</p>
<p>然而「都市風光」也不能算是一部完全成功的作品，要知都市中的醜惡不是那幾個小小的丑角所能代表的，劇作者僅僅拿着這幾個小角色來盡量的嘲笑，而把大的罪惡和製造罪惡的人們忽略了，就是那幾個小角色中的市儈（王俊三），走狗（陳秘書），狐狸精（張小雲）也給輕輕放過，而偏把那窮文人作爲嘲笑的主要對象，這不得不說是劇作者的眼睛祇看見了小處，而放過了大的方面。同時看西洋鏡的父，母，女，甥，即是鏡內映放的「都市風光」中的父，母，女，而甥却變做了「戀愛至上主義者」李夢華，我不知道爲什麽要一人扮演兩個角色？如果劇作者的用意在暗示「都市風光一中那幾個人型即是看西洋鏡者在都市中的面像，那就未免犯了錯誤；因爲這幾個「棄農具」的農民，總有不得已的苦衷纔離開農村，流浪到都市的，不管都市環境怎樣轉變他們的生活和性情，他們却沒有資格做「狐狸精」，做「戀愛至上主義者」，……反之，他們倒要憐忙的追求工作，在生活綫上痛苦的掙扎，呻吟！</p>
<p>除了主題的歪曲，演員的配置上也不大適當。作爲女主角的張新珠，似乎無一可取處；表情和動作都很生硬，對白也不大純熟。本來她「做戲」的地方應該很多，以一個羨慕虛榮的女子，既要應付兩個情人，又要買好父母，同時還要爲目己的用費打算，是需要活潑的姿態，圓滑的交際，柔媚的動作，風騷的表情，纔能適合她的處境，然而她却沒有發揮這幾種個性的能力！作爲男主角的唐納也很平常，一個一戀愛至上主義者」，對於愛人的態度應該表現十分熱烈，失戀後尤其要表示極端懊喪，甚至痛哭，發狂也不失之過分，可是唐納却沒有做到這地步。雖然悲哀的表演可以破壞喜劇的氣氛，然而痛哭流涕也止可以參加笑料呢！其中值得稱讚的是顧夢鶴和藍蘋，他倆對於自已所擔任的角色都很稱職，表情和動作也很逼眞而不勉强，可惜給他倆「做戲」的機會太少了，假如掉成主角，也許會給全劇生色不少呢！</p>
<p>總之，「都市風光」有不少的缺點，但不能掩蓋她的好處，牠那新的姿態是值得一看的。</p>

<p>在「雜誌年」「小報年」與「不景氣」的呼聲的交流中，我們曾不幸地看到許多好的雜誌（如革新後的「現代」，如「譯文」……）停刊了，但同時却又有許多新的刊物出現在我們眼前，由此不僅可以表現一般努力於文化運動者的艱苦奮鬥精神，而且可以看出一般大衆要求新知識的迫切。</p>
<p>「生活知識」，便是最近新出的許多刊物中值得注意的一種。這刊物在其「發刋詢」中表明了它的產生的客觀情勢後，對其自身曾作了這樣一個說明：</p>
<p>「正因爲我們底刊物是被動地爲客觀情勢所呼出，我們也就必須依客觀的情勢而自動地從主觀上給我們底刊物樹立一個明確的目標。我們底刊物底目標，如我們底刊物底名稱所示，是生活知識。但不是生活於任何時間及任何地方的自然人所都應有的知識，而是生活於國土喪失，農村破產，「天災」因人禍才加劇的現代中國底社會所特有的知識。」</p>
<p>我們有了　　　　　　　　　　　得　刊　的內　是與其「發刊　」中所　出的那個目　　　一致的，雖然其中有些地方還不罷个人完全滿意。</p>
<p>依創刊號看　，「生活知識」是一個小型的綜合的文化雜誌。其中關於經濟·政治·科學·哲學以及文藝的文字都有，而且大體是都可說是在其「發刊詞」中所提出的那個「目標」之下寫成的。現在，爲使讀者明瞭起見，特將其各欄文字的內容作一個簡要的介紹——</p>
<p>關於經濟解剖的，在創刊號甲有兩篇文字：徐行君的「現代世界經濟大勢」與楚辛君的羅斯來華做什麽？前者首先指出了壟斷與競爭的結合乃是「現代世界經濟混亂的根源」；接着又依此說明了在對外貿易上「屯併政策」以及「關稅戰貨幣戰」的產生，從而「經濟的國家主義」之形式；隨後更指出了在「經濟國家主義」盛行之下現代世界經濟所表現出的幾個新的現象：國際市塲的解體，世界經濟的勞動分工的縮小，國家對經濟生活干涉的增長，慢性的大批的失業現象沒有解决的徵兆：最後則指出了在世界經濟混亂中，各資本主義國家想用戰爭作爲出路的事情。在短短四五千字的一篇文章中，把目前世界經濟的實際情况明白地表現了出來，這是這篇文章的主要特點。後者——「羅斯來華做什麽？」是從羅斯來華一事解說了英日美在華的衝突，這是一篇與我們的現實生活關係最深的文章，是值得一讀的。</p>
<p>國際政治的文章也有兩篇。第一篇是何對君的「意阿戰——帝國主義戰——和平」，在這中問作者依據最近的事實指出了帝國主義列强宰割阿比西尼亞，宰割弱小民族的實情，依據意大利國內的實際情形與夫英意的衝突說明了東菲問題發生的原因，最後則結論到在帝國主義的衝突中，各弱小民族必然要起來「從解决自身痛苦中解决帝國主義間的衝突」。第二篇是凌鈞君的「意阿衝突的幾個前途估計」，依目前情勢看來，雖然作者的估計似乎與事實有些不合，但在其分析中也有一些值得注意的意見。</p>
<p>哲學講話中思奇君的「觀念論的要點」是一篇通俗簡明的文章。在此作者對觀念論哲學的宇宙論，本體論，認識論與方法論都有簡要的說明，一般初學哲學者看了之後，是可以得到一個簡要的對於觀念論的系統的概念的。</p>
<p>在科學界一欄中的兩篇文章，都是很有趣味而且很有意義的。「發明的故事」一篇是翻蹕的，其中講的是因油井起火所引出的關於撲滅大火的發明的故事，並於其中講到了許多關於發明的事情。這篇文章雖然還未刊完，但我們就在讀了那已經刊出的一部分後，也可以知道蘇聯的所謂「集體發明者」的意義和一些自然科學的道理。其次是庶謙君的「從數學和我們生活的關係上說起」，看來好像是一篇硬性文章，但因作者依據實際生活去解釋問題，從實際生活中找出淺顯的例證去說明數學與生活的關係，所以讀起來不僅沒有「硬」的感覺，而且還覺得很有興味。</p>
<p>對於文學藝術，「生活知識」是龍與了較多的地位的。但嚴格說來，在創刊號中所刊載的關於文學藝術的文字，有些是不能與其他各欄的文章媲美的。首先，如關露君的小說「倒閉」，雖然寫的是工商業凋敝中目前中國社會的一種眞實現象，但作者的藝術的表現力很不充分，因此使人覺得這不是藝術地描寫成的小說，而是一個故事的簡單叙述。其次是周鋼鳴君的「怎樣讀小說」，這篇文章雖然還未刊完，但我們看了已刊出的一部分後，覺得如果此文的未刊者是與</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>日刋出者　　的，　在作者的工　的理論與筆法下寫成的，那這便是一篇缺少精彩比較平凡的文章。作者在這裏所講的雖然在理論上沒有什麽問題，但因為只是一些幾乎誰都知道的空洞的理論原則，所以使人覺得缺少實際的內容和精深的理論。我以為現在的體者已經有些進步了，什麽「文學是社會現象」，「文學是反映社曾生活的」，……這類原則上的理論，他們巳經聽熟了，因此我們目前的責任不是在於空洞地向他們講理論原則，而是要實際地去應用原則，發展原則，使我們的理論深刻，充實，有用，不致成為平凡。自然，通俗是必要的，但若能用實際的材料，用活潑大方的筆法，用通俗的形式表現出深刻的理論不是更好嗎？如果因通俗而流於平凡，不是和不通俗一樣地壞嗎？這一點我們希望「生活知識」的編者和作者要特別注意。此外如力生君的「關於莫拿麗薩」，張庚君的「為觀衆的戲劇講話」，候默君的「桃花扇」評，都是値得一讀的作品。</p>
<p>對於目前發生的一般社會現象，「生活知識」還談得較少，因此减少了它的現實的積極性。我以為「生活知識」應該添設一欄，專門來談那些為人注意的現實的社會現象，如像「讀書生活」的「社會相」，「世界知識」的「瞭望臺」（談國際事件的）一樣。同時，文字的通俗，大衆化，這雖然巳為「生活知識」做到了，但我們還希望它在理論的深刻，內容的充實上更加努力。還有，本期錯字太多，亦望今後在校對上留意。</p>

<h3 id="c210">病中散記 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭萍</p>
<p>一個先天本來瘦弱的身體，平日又安置在需要强悍體魄才能對付的工作上，因此，病就纏到身上了。</p>
<p>其實僅僅是小病，可也因此睡倒了；腰肢痠軟，頭壳陣陣作痛，微風吹來，全身也會攣顫，旁人都說，好好睡過一晚，出上一身大汗，明天就可精神復原的，我也這樣想，就好好地睡在床上</p>
<p>汗從毛孔裏透出來了，我心上就一喜，過後，汗水如大水似的在身體各處湧出來，額上的汗珠更如豆粒一般大，那汗水的臭味從被窩裏一陣陣的送進鼻孔，眞是難聞異常，又忍耐過了些時，被窩裏差不多像黃梅時的濕桶一樣，實在再也耐不住了，想：出這麽多汗大概也總足够了吧，於是大胆把被窩放鬆了</p>
<p>因為吃的大多是開水，雖然出了汗，仍然要小便，並且每晚七時的大便似乎也到時了，就想上毛厠。我是獨身人一向住在學校的宿舍裏的，因為住在學校內，就得遵守如一般學生所遵守的種種規矩，平時過這種機械生活尙能過得來，只是病中往往就吃虧了，就如大便，不論你病與不病，一律都得走過一片大塲才能到毛厠。我因為怕病中受凉，全身披上厚厚的毛毯，剛搖晃晃地踏出宿舍，迎面就是一陣寒風打來，渾身都打顫了。到得毛厠，頭腦暈眩，天旋地轉，好容易忽忽結束了再走過廣坪回宿舍去。</p>
<p>再睡到床上時，被窩內的餘溫尙在，舒適多了，可是這一夜的睡眠實在是最痛苦不過的，在夢中時時驚醒，是一種非常難過的驚醒。</p>
<p>第二天比平常醒得還早，眼睛望望天窗，感到睡在床上太不舒適，自己的小病自己總以為睡了一晚一定已好了，就穿衣盥洗，可是腦袋漲痛，較昨日下午更甚。我還是去上課，叫學生作文，自己坐在桌旁看他們用心構思，頭腦一陣陣的量眩加甚了，我想讓他們好好的作文，我可以回宿舍躺一下，又一想，還是不行，一個人躺在宿舍裏還不是無聊腋煩嗎？並且也許我不伴着他們，他們會潦草塞責的。好吧，還是忍耐着生一下吧！</p>
<p>下午，仍然躺在床上，在被窩裏又流着大顆的汗珠，人半淸醒半昏沈的睡去了好幾次。我開始焦灼起來了：要弄成大病不會？</p>
<p>吃稀飯，沒有味，叫茶房將床下一瓶罐頭牛肉送廚房去蒸來吃，吃了也沒味，吃了三塊，剛睡過一時，肚子莫名其妙的難過起來，終於，嘔出來，一根根的肉絲還是一根根的肉絲。</p>
<p>這時心中正希望有什麽靈丹能立刻治愈我的病，病中的苦惱，姑且不去管他，就是有許多急待要做的事情，也都無法做了，急待要會的朋友又無法去會了。焦急，焦急，我一向是急性子脾氣的人，病中更加焦急了。</p>
<p>陸先生勸我去買萬金油，塗在太陽穴裏，我遵着做了，×先生，勸我吃生梨，我也買來吃了，後來校醫說，受了些寒，拿一點藥去吃吃就好了，他從藥瓶裏倒出十幾顆灰色圓扁的藥粒，他說每隔四小時服一顆，我也沒有看淸那是什麽藥品，拿着就走了。</p>
<p>可是病勢並不見輕减，額角如火燒，頭腦仍暈眩，有人說生梨性太凉，有人說那藥片吃不得，我更加惶急了，我還有許多事要急待去幹，並且有好幾個朋友的事託着我去幹！</p>
<p>平時在事務忙不過來的時候，時常想：「若得生一塲小病，偷個半日閒，也是人生樂事」，到現在眞的病上身來了，才知道「無病一身輕」，方是的語。</p>
<p>平時也常常想，人活够了，若得一旦大解脫，那是多麽快意的事，現在方知道，小病一兩日，公私未了事務，都將無法應付，何况所謂大解脫呢？人生到世上來，眞只有苦難！</p>
<p>要想出外找醫生診治，又適逢星期日，醫生們大多停診，若要特別掛號，我這病又似乎沒有這麽嚴重，這一天只得在忍耐中度過。</p>
<p>星期天，宿舍里幾乎門可羅雀，我一個人好像在死城中一樣。好容易從天明望到天黑，日暮了，寂寞的星期日總算在無可忍耐的忍耐中過去了。</p>
<p>這天晚上，又流了一身汗，週身似乎輕鬆多了。</p>
<p>翌日（星期一），向學校里請假一天，十時許去找醫生診治。我一向是差不多不大願意向人請假的，就是病了若還能勉强支持，也决不請假；在學生時代也如此，我記得在高級小學里還得過四學期的「勤學不輟」的褒狀，有一學期，因偶患小恙，師長數次督促請假，但我終拾不得勤學不輟的榮譽終不肯請假，而仍保持了那一張褒狀的。</p>
<p>進了醫室，醫生略一按脈，瞧了瞧舌苔，問我幾句，他就提筆寫道：「風邪外襲挾濕滯交蘊身熱形寒頭痛骨楚舌薄膩脈滑數宜疏邪宣化。」又開了幾樣藥名，事情就完了。</p>
<p>一點多鐘，藥店裏已將煎就的藥送來了。頭汁，二汁分裝在南個小熱水瓶里。藥味是那樣苦澀，但也得張大了喉嚨直灌下去。有一次幾乎要嘔吐出來，但終於給我下了最大的壓制力把它制止下來，並沒有眞的作嘔嘔。</p>
<p>大約小病楚只消三四天的。到了第五天，我當是自己的病巳好了，大模大樣的穿衣起身，與平常一樣上毛厠上膳堂，但在毛厠里小便，尿色是像茄皮酒一般紅，確有幾分可怕，到膳堂里吃飯，也只有半碗飯的食量了。人家都說我小病四天，臉也淸瘦多了，我自己也有點覺得，在磅秤上一站，本來是一百零八磅的瘦身體，現在只得一百零四磅了，雖然不至於「人比黃花瘦」那樣楚楚可憐，但也確乎使自己覺得自己的身體太不能為大用了。好在年來自己的心也漸漸老去，那一番雄圖壯志巳不再需要這不結實的身體了。</p>

<h3 id="c211">華僑在全世界（完） <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>但是，在這三個原因中，最重要的還是最後一個。因為假使我們的國力充實，那卽使各地人士嫉恨華僑，想要排斥華僑，也是不敢隨便對付的。我們看，英美法意等國的僑民，在世界各地不是很多嗎？其勢力在有些地方不是都很大嗎？但他們却從未受到別人的排斥和壓迫。其原因不消說是在於其國家富强，別人不敢隨便對付。</p>
<p>所以，今後我們的僑務要想發展，我千萬以上的僑胞要想有光明的前途，便只有努力將我們的國家從半殖民地的狀態下振救出來，與世界各先進國家並駕齊驅。一定要我們的國際地位提高了，我們的僑民在世界各地的地位才能昇高，才不致受人無理壓迫和排斥。假使我們不能擺脫弱小民族的頭銜，那華僑在世界上將會比猶太人還不如，到處都要被人壓迫的。</p>
<p>現在還不要說英美，就是非洲和美洲的黑人，就是暹羅安南等同樣的弱小民族，也要隨便欺侮我僑胞；在世界上的中國人乃至中國貨，都好像是頂成問題的，連最近運往英國去的蛋也被說成是壞蛋了！如此情形，倘若我們還不努方振救國家，振救民族，則不僅今後的華僑在世界上不能立足，恐怕連我們的國家民族也快要不能自存了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Situation in Xianghe Remains Grave: Shang Zhen Visits Tada, but No Concrete Solution is Reached; City Gates Open with Strict Inspections; Zhao Xingwu Appointed as County Magistrate; Liu Yaodong Moved to Anfu Village for Detention <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the Xianghe incident, Shang Zhen, after arriving in Tianjin and contacting the Japanese side, has yet to find a concrete solution. However, Tada expressed hope for a swift resolution to prevent the unrest from spreading into the war zone. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) In Xianghe city, a small number of shops were forced to open on the 26th. The serious situation has not abated. The ringleader of the rioters, Wu Zhenyi, relies on the protection of Japanese ronin and is defiant, refusing to accept official advice. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Tongxian telephone report, Wu Guanting, the leader of the Xianghe rebellion, reviewed over 160 members of the Public Security Bureau police and the Self-Defense Corps in the city on the afternoon of the 24th, issuing them one month's salary and awarding each of them two yuan. The fake county magistrate, An Houzhai, upon seeing the gravity of the situation, firmly refused to take office. On the 25th, Wu convened another meeting and nominated Zhao Xingwu, a local bully, to take over as county magistrate. He also formally appointed Gao Junshan as the Director of the Public Security Bureau and Jiang Enliang as the Commander of the Self-Defense Corps. The heads of the education, construction, health, and finance bureaus were all replaced by Wu with his cronies. The rebel leader Hu Chengwu, due to disagreements with Wu and others, has fled. Liu Yaodong, whom the Hebei Provincial Government sent to take over as county magistrate, was moved on the 25th from Tianqi Temple to Hu Chengwu's home, about one li east of Anfu Village, and is still being held under armed guard by the rebels. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Tongxian telephone report states that the city of Xianghe is still occupied by Jiang Enliang leading the corps police, and the situation remains grave. The west gate is open, and merchants and residents are subjected to strict inspections before being allowed to pass. Red and green paper slogans with absurd language are plastered everywhere. The family members of the former county magistrate Zhao Zhongpu and Public Security Section Chief Bai Zhichun have all been detained, and their whereabouts are unknown. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a report from Tongxian, the west gate of Xianghe County opened at 9 a.m. this morning, allowing people in and out of the city to pass, but they must undergo strict inspections at the city gate. After the fake county magistrate An Houzhai took office yesterday, he issued a proclamation with absurd wording this morning along with the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and instructed merchants not to panic themselves. The Self-Defense Corps still guards all city gates and has placed sandbags at each gate, and the situation remains very serious. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Xianghe incident, the provincial government, fearing it would affect the security of other counties, has ordered all counties to take strict precautions to prevent similar incidents from occurring. After arriving in Tianjin, Shang Zhen has discussed solutions with Tada and others, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, and progress has been made. Shang himself will remain in Tianjin to negotiate everything, and will not come to Beiping for the next few days. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Diplomatic sources say that the embassies in Beiping are paying close attention to the Xianghe incident. The British and American ambassadors in Beijing and Shanghai have been sending telegrams to Beiping for days, inquiring about the truth. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The central government is paying close attention to the Xianghe rebellion and has been sending telegrams to Beiping for days to inquire about the truth, and has telegraphed Shang Zhen, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, to quickly seek a solution. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Tongxian telephone report, the fake county magistrate of Xianghe, An Houzhai, did not take office because he saw the situation was unfavorable. Wu Huan and others held a meeting and decided to appoint the local bully Zhao Xingwu as his replacement. The heads of the construction, education, and finance bureaus were also appointed by Wu with his cronies. After being detained in Tianqi Temple, Liu Yaodong has now been moved to Hu's residence in Anfu Village, where he is guarded by the bandits. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 9 a.m. on the 24th, the people of Sanhe County, also incited by Chinese traitors, gathered a crowd of several hundred and entered the city with banners to petition. The county magistrate ordered the local militia to ascend the city walls and guard them, closing the four gates tightly and refusing them entry. The rioters were unsuccessful and dispersed. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Japanese plane flew in from Shanhaiguan along the Beining Railway, passing over Tangshan and scouting the Xianghe and Sanhe areas. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Sakai Takashi, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese garrison in North China, has returned to his country for a three-week recuperation due to illness. He boarded a ship early on the 26th. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China, Sakai, stated that the Japanese side has absolutely no involvement in or background for the Xianghe Incident, and hopes that China will quickly seek a solution to avoid escalation. The rumors that the Japanese side is doing this or that are absolutely untrue. The authorities in the Japanese concessions in Tianjin are not protecting any personnel. Today, at the meeting of all consuls in Tianjin, I urged them to pay attention to the progress of Sino-Japanese cooperation and not to create unconscious actions. Sakai, whose athlete's foot has not yet healed, is scheduled to take a ship back to his country on the 26th for a three-week recuperation, and will return to his post when the period expires.

The Public Security Bureau has also scheduled a security conference for the heads of various district bureaus on the 26th. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to numerous rumors, Beiping City increased its guard posts tonight. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin is stepping up its security due to many rumors. Police from the Public Security Bureau have begun searching passengers on trams on various routes. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

Not only in North China, but also in South China, it is beginning economic activities. Taiwan may combine with it, or form another company. If it is difficult to form another company, it will combine with Xingzhong.

<h3 id="e9">Yan Xishan Flies from Taiyuan to Nanjing; Wang Jingwei, He Yingqin, and Others Welcome Him at the Airport; In the Afternoon, Yan Visits Wang to Report on the Military and Political Situation in Shanxi Province <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan arrived in Nanjing at 9 a.m. on the 26th, flying in a Ford plane from Taiyuan. Fan Xiangli, Ning Tian, Gao Tang, Tai Chuchang, Zhang Guanwu, and four others came with him. President Wang, Minister He, and others welcomed him at the airport. After Yan got off the plane, he went to Kong Xiangxi's private residence in the mausoleum area to rest. President Wang, Minister He, and others went to visit him and reminisced. In the afternoon, Yan personally went to Wang's official residence at No. 1 Tiebu to report on the military and political situation in Shanxi Province. He also elaborated on the issue of land village ownership and local barter trade. In the evening, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Tiaoyuan, Pan Youqiang, and others jointly hosted a banquet for Yan. Wang also scheduled to host a reception for him on the 27th. Yan said that the social order in Shanxi and Suiyuan is still stable, and the security of other provinces in North China is also orderly. The general situation seems to be calm. He did not know the truth about the Xianghe incident, and expected that it would be resolved after the authorities in Hebei handled it. The Datong-Pukou Railway is under construction and Yan has contributed Shanxi's proposed plan for land village ownership to the government. Yan intends to try this village ownership system in a few counties in Shanxi first, and implement it after a considerable period of trial implementation. When implemented, it should be implemented uniformly throughout the province, so as not to cause too much trouble. Shanxi advocates the "Ten Cloths Transport Cloth" plan, which is still being implemented. Shanxi intends to implement a barter method based on mutual benefit and assistance. Detailed methods are still subject to mutual consultation and decision, and the implementation date is uncertain. His proposal to the Sixth Plenary Session is not yet prepared. The Tenth Land Village Ownership and other cases, if necessary, are proposed by the Central Government for discussion. Besides attending the conference and visiting the central authorities, he has no other tasks for this trip. He has a considerable stay in Nanjing, and will return north after the conference closes and the task is completed. Someone asked Yan what he thought of the current domestic and foreign affairs. Yan smiled and replied that he has not been to the capital for six or seven years, and he is inevitably estranged from all domestic and foreign affairs facilities. Even if he has feelings, he cannot express them all in a few words. He will slowly tell them when there is an opportunity. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian, the director of the Taiyuan Suiyuan Office in Nanjing, said that Yan's visit was to attend the Sixth Plenary Session and visit the central authorities. He is scheduled to stay in Nanjing for more than ten days and then return to Shanxi. Whether or not he will attend the Fifth Plenary Session is still undecided, because the political affairs in Taiyuan are complicated and a decision must be made at that time.

<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan arrived in Nanjing at 1:30 p.m. on the 26th on a Ford plane provided by Chairman Jiang. He received a warm welcome from all sides. Yan had stayed in Nanjing at the end of 1927 to participate in the reorganization conference for two months. He had returned to Shanxi in February 1928, and has not been to Nanjing since, which is seven years ago. This time, he decided to go to Nanjing to attend the Sixth Plenary Session and the Fifth Plenary Session and to discuss bandit suppression with the central authorities. After learning about it, Chairman Jiang immediately went to the Ford plane to welcome him. Military and political leaders in Nanjing went to the airport one after another to welcome him at noon, including Wang Jingwei, He Yingqin, Tang Shengzhi, Chen Tiaoyuan, Zhu Peide, Zhao Pilian, Zhang Zhizhong, Yang Jie, Cao Haosen, and hundreds of generals and above from various military agencies and fellow Shanxi natives.

Yan nodded frequently to thank them, and then took a car to the mausoleum area of the Kong residence to rest, and received visitors and the press. At 4 p.m., he visited President Wang, He Yingqin, Chen Tiaoyuan, Tang Shengzhi, and others.

Yan received reporters at the Kong residence, and according to him, the remnants of bandits in northern Shaanxi have made rapid progress since Deputy Commander Zhang came to Shaanxi to command. Shanxi has also dispatched troops to push towards the river bank to assist in the suppression. The bandits on the border between Henan and Shanxi have also been sent to suppress them, and the cleanup can be expected. The Shanxi Good People's Association has been renamed the Advocacy of Justice Group, with the aim of uniting good people, punishing bad people, eliminating social injustice, establishing social justice, reducing communist disasters, and strengthening self-reliance to save the country. It is now widely organizing Shanxi construction, focusing on provincial, county, and village plans and actions together, and selecting special matters as the goals of efforts. The trade of native products between Zhejiang and Shanxi and the progress of property securities are all being planned and tested. The Datong-Pukou Road is planned to be built to Datong and can be completed before June next year. Yan finally said that the land village ownership case has been submitted to the National Government. He has no other proposals for the Sixth Plenary Session. He is also not sure when he will leave Nanjing after the meeting. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Significance of Expanding Air Routes in the Pacific Ocean <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Recently, there have been several important pieces of news regarding the expansion of air routes in the Pacific Ocean. These are worthy of attention: (1) The trans-Pacific air route, which has been in operation for over a year and is managed by Pan American Airways, will conduct a full-line test flight next month. Formal service is expected to begin in January next year. The route starts in San Francisco and temporarily ends in Macau. In the future, it may extend to Hong Kong, and eventually hopes to reach ports in southern China. (2) On the 13th of this month, the US authorities announced the incorporation of Jarvis, Baker, and Howland Islands in the South Pacific into US territory, preparing to open an air route from Hawaii to Australia, connecting the British and American air routes. These three islands will serve as important transit stations. (3) Earlier this month, Mr. Smith, the British aviation supervisor, came to the Far East to inspect the bases of the Royal Air Force. He stated that Britain would establish a huge civilian and military aviation base in Hong Kong. On the 24th, the Royal Air Force aircraft Dorade successfully flew from Penang to Hong Kong, setting a record of twelve hours. It is said that test flights will continue. It is likely that a branch line of the British-Australian air route will be established from Singapore to Hong Kong in the near future.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the development of world transportation, the above news is all welcome. In the vast world, human beings are scattered across several landmasses, separated by vast oceans. This natural barrier is one of the reasons for the separation between human beings. Thanks to the development of science, humans have finally acquired the means to transcend the oceans and control the wind in the sky. This should be an important boost in promoting international cooperation and the ideal of human harmony. But the current reality seems to be quite different. What frightens the world today is the crisis of war caused by hostility between humans and suspicion between nations. Currently, the scientific tools of many countries are not working for the ideal of peace, but are instead listening to the command of the god of war. In the winds and clouds over the Pacific Ocean, there has suddenly been a surge in the activity of these many aircraft. While we certainly hold great respect for those warriors who conquer nature, at the same time, we cannot help but have some doubts about the meaning of this expansion of air routes.</p>
<p>In recent years, the shores of the Pacific Ocean have been filled with the smoke of war. All aviation activities during this period do not seem to be able to escape military relations. The islands through which the United States established a trans-Pacific air route have mostly been placed under the administration of the military. The British air routes to the Far East are also run by the Royal Air Force. After reading the article "Japan Under the Wings of Aircraft" in the August issue of American Mercury magazine this year, we know that the sharp increase in Japan's military budget since 1931 is also related to the development of military aviation. Currently, competition among countries' air routes in the Pacific has triggered an important role in politics and diplomacy. Pan American Airways is still keeping the routes and destinations of its Pacific air routes a closely guarded secret because of "diplomatic subtleties." At the same time, according to the Associated Press, European countries are also trying to consolidate air transportation between Europe and Asia because of the expansion of US air routes. For example, Britain plans to expand its air routes to China, and France has allowed British air routes to pass through Annam, allowing its air routes to have a stopover point in Hong Kong and reach China from Hanoi. These are significant signs.</p>
<p>It is extremely noteworthy that the great powers hope to make our country the terminus of their air routes. The winds and clouds over the Pacific Ocean originally centered on the China problem. Now that the air routes in the Pacific Ocean are actively extending to the coast of our country, the ambition of the great powers to seize control of our country's gateway is even more evident. In the future great explosion in the Pacific, our country will be entirely under the threat of other people's wings. As it stands now, our northern and eastern coastal skies are often roamed arbitrarily by foreign aircraft. Our country's air sovereignty has been completely destroyed, which has shown the signs of future disasters. Because of the expansion of the great powers' air routes in the Pacific, and thinking of the crisis hidden here, I especially raise this issue for the authorities and people of our country to pay close attention to.</p>

<p>(Rome) A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that Italy will accept Britain's invitation to participate in the naval conference to be held in London on December 2. (National News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's reply to Britain will be submitted to the cabinet meeting on the 29th and issued immediately after approval.

<p>Asmara, regarding the military situation, the Italian army in the north is in a position to advance or retreat as it chooses. However, judging from the current situation, whether the Italian army will continue its operations cannot be determined solely from a military perspective. In other words, it still depends on diplomatic relations. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The war in Abyssinia has now entered its fourth week, with both sides remaining silent. Only the sound of tanks, appearing for the first time in Somalia, breaks the silence. The Italian army was originally concentrated in the east, north, and south of Abyssinia. However, ships are constantly shuttling, still transporting troops across the Mediterranean to the war zone. The Abyssinian Emperor's Imperial Guard, trained by Europeans, is currently defending the main road from the Abyssinian capital to prevent enemy invasion. The major battle has not yet erupted. According to the Roman public report, only five Italian soldiers and forty Italian colonial troops have been killed. Approximately 180,000 Italian troops are stationed in a fifty-mile wide and twenty-mile deep position in Tigre, northern Abyssinia, currently engaged in consolidating defenses, building roads, and digging wells. They may not advance until November. The Italian army is facing off against three Abyssinian armies, but there has been no contact. Italian newspapers report daily on the surrender of Abyssinian chieftains, and state that General De Bono, the commander-in-chief, has incorporated the entire region of Tigre into Italian territory. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian Emperor delivered a speech yesterday afternoon in the capital of his country. After being broadcast by the Paris Evening News, people here were able to hear the Emperor's words, which stated, "Since the Italian army launched an offensive against our country's northern and southern borders on October 3rd, the war on the front lines, although once calm, has now resumed its advance. Ten areas of our country are now being ravaged, and our army has no choice but to rise up and resist the enemy to defend ourselves. Our country has always been willing to treat friendly nations with friendship. This war was not initiated by us, as the world can attest. Now, to defend our territory, we are compelled to take up arms against the enemy, for this is our only right." (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Ministry of War today exaggerated the news of the Abyssinian army under General Seyoum attacking the right flank of the Italian army near Aksum, stating that two battalions of artillery should be dispatched to repel this enemy force. The telegram received by the Ministry of War praised the bravery of General Seyoum's troops. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Adi-Grar, within a week, or next Monday, which is the thirteenth anniversary of the Fascist Party's march on Rome, the Italian army will launch a major offensive against Maqale. This theory is gaining traction today. The road from here to the front lines is filled day and night with vehicles carrying ammunition and military supplies. Donkeys carrying water bladders are also constantly on the move. Huge artillery vehicles rumble along the rugged roads, raising dust wherever they go. The Associated Press correspondent accompanying the Italian army in the north witnessed workers of all races building roads everywhere. The general public here believes that this offensive will be part of a full-scale general offensive. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital, it has been learned here that the Abyssinian army in the north, led by General Seyoum, the governor of Tigray Province, attacked the right flank of the Italian army near Aksum today, but was eventually repelled by the Italian artillery. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital, Special Correspondent O'Chiara reports, according to official announcements, a large Italian force, covered by bombers, occupied two Abyssinian outposts on October 10th, one along the Webi Shebelle River and the other in the town of Qarafa in the Wogga Dahn area. The Abyssinian army was forced to retreat. On October 18th, four Italian aircraft flew over Gora Hai and later bombed the town of Khelit Hapu. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital, the Abyssinian Emperor has now decided to engage the enemy in a decisive battle in the Taysi area. The Hurgas Kompites and Asmara Wan tribal peoples, who have been feuding for centuries, have also joined forces and are heading to the front lines. It is reported that 70,000 cavalrymen are concentrated near Taysi. General Seyoum, General Kessan, and Minister of War General Getachew are deploying a large number of troops. A government spokesman announced here today that although reconciliation efforts are underway in Europe regarding the Abyssinian-Italian dispute, the Abyssinian people intend to expel the Italian army after their troops are concentrated.

<h3 id="e20">Abyssinian Capital Radio Station Triples Profits; Monthly Revenue Reaches One Million Francs <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Abyssinian Capital, Special Correspondent O'Chiara reports, the Abyssinian national radio broadcasting station is now a major source of revenue for the Abyssinian government. Since the outbreak of hostilities, journalists from all over the world have gathered in the Abyssinian capital, all using the radio station to transmit news. Revenue from telegram fees has reached a staggering one million francs per month. The Abyssinian national radio broadcasting station was founded in 1930 and was originally run by Italian merchants. Later, the Abyssinian government, fearing that the only means of communication with the outside world would be monopolized by Italy, secretly signed contracts with a Swedish engineer and a French engineer to build another radio station. Although this radio station has very little power, it is still sufficient. At the beginning of this year, the radio station run by the Italian merchants abandoned competitive operations. Thus, they rely on the new radio station as the only means of communication with the outside world. Since the outbreak of war, the daily transmission volume has increased from 500 words to 100,000 words. There are now three radio stations operating simultaneously in the capital, and ten radio stations are distributed in various Abyssinian military strongholds. The equipment used by each radio station is made in France, and the technicians are all Abyssinian, trained in the capital by foreign engineers. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) The Labour Party issued its election manifesto last night, stating that the Labour Party now seeks to sincerely cooperate with the League of Nations and all countries outside the League that desire peace. The Labour Party firmly supports the collective peace system and demands prompt action from the League of Nations to end the war in Africa, and then immediately continue negotiations on disarmament among all countries. However, the Labour Party advocates fully maintaining national defense forces, limited to what is necessary and required by the obligations of a member state of the League of Nations.

<p>(Paris) Édouard Herriot, the president of the Radical Socialist Party and a non-cabinet minister, recently delivered a speech at the Radical Socialist Party Congress, stating, "France, by virtue of its responsibility and honor, has the necessity to implement the League of Nations Covenant. Britain opposed signing the 1924 Geneva Protocol on Collective Security ten years ago, and its tacit agreement to create collective sanctions is something that our France should be pleased with. Some people criticize Britain's attitude towards the Abyssinian crisis, but it should be known that we should not underestimate Britain's efforts. The British hate lies the most. Now that the British have claimed that they are completely maintaining the League of Nations Covenant in the current dispute and do not have any selfish motives, then we should believe them. British cabinet ministers or gentlemen have always valued integrity, and we should not doubt them. Since British cabinet members have declared 'We stand on this,' then we should completely trust them and not suspect that they have other motives. The real focus of the current issue is not pro-Italy or anti-Italy, nor is it pro-Britain or anti-Britain, but whether we support the League of Nations or oppose the League of Nations."

<p>(London) It has recently been reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has submitted new proposals to French Prime Minister Laval for resolving the Abyssinian-Italian dispute, which Laval has notified to British Ambassador to France Sir Clerk. Although this news was denied by the French Foreign Ministry a few days ago, according to The Times, Britain and France have indeed exchanged views on the Abyssinian-Italian dispute. The newspaper reported, "The French government had inquired with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini about what conditions he would use as a basis for negotiations, and then received a reply from Italy, which was then forwarded to London by Sir Clerk. The British government is currently considering Italy's proposals, and when the appropriate time comes, it will express its views to Laval and make various suggestions. As for Italy's proposals, we can assert that they will not be accepted by the League of Nations, Britain, France, and the Abyssinian Emperor." According to The Times, Mussolini's proposals consist of six points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Divide Abyssinia into two parts: the mainland territory and the areas inhabited by non-Amharic ethnic groups.</p>
<p>(2) The areas inhabited by non-Amharic ethnic groups should be placed under Italian control in the form of a League of Nations mandate or lease.</p>
<p>(3) The Abyssinian chieftains, clergy, and people of Tigray Province have already recognized Italian sovereignty, and this should be recognized as a fait accompli.</p>
<p>(4) Abyssinian armaments should be effectively monitored to ensure the security of Italian territories in East Africa.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding slavery and other outdated customs, the League of Nations should be responsible for urging Abyssinia to comply with the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>(6) Abyssinia can use the port of Asab in Italian Eritrea as a free port. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(London) Eden is scheduled to go to Geneva on October 30th to attend the League of Nations Sanctions Adjustment Committee the following day to consider the governments' responses regarding the implementation of financial and economic sanctions against Italy. Hopes that the Abyssinian-Italian war may be resolved before the implementation of the pressure plan on Italy seem unlikely to be realized. These hopes are mostly based on the exchange of views between France and Italy, but it is not yet known what the nature of any suggestions exchanged. The League of Nations may not delay the date of implementation of economic sanctions because of this. Responsible parties here all feel that there is no other way than to proceed in Geneva with the plan that has already been agreed upon in principle, as this is the best way to prompt the Abyssinian-Italian dispute to be resolved as soon as possible on terms acceptable to Italy, Abyssinia, and the League of Nations.

<p>(Paris) Le Petit Parisien reported that the new proposals for resolving the Abyssinian-Italian dispute put forward by the Italian Prime Minister will likely be submitted to the Special Committee of Five Nations of the League of Nations Council for review. The Five-Nation Committee ceased its work after its proposal of September 18 was rejected by Italy. However, the League of Nations has assured that if new proposals are put forward, the committee will continue to meet. The newspaper also believes that the League of Nations Sanctions Scheme Adjustment Committee is scheduled to convene on October 31st, so diplomatic activity in Geneva will greatly develop in the middle of next week. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Hoare intends to go to Geneva in person at that time, and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval may also participate in the League of Nations' work if necessary, as not only the implementation of economic sanctions needs to be discussed, but other major issues also need to be dealt with together.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat has not received any notification regarding the conditions for resolving the Abyssinian-Italian dispute. However, it is reported that League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, when he went to London to attend the funeral of the late Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Henderson, discussed the possibility of continued progress in negotiations with the British government. If a solution to the Abyssinian-Italian dispute is to be found within the League of Nations framework, then the cessation of war should be its prerequisite, which is highly valued by League of Nations officials. According to well-informed sources, negotiations to resolve the Abyssinian-Italian dispute will likely still be handled by the League of Nations Council, but the Council will entrust the Five-Nation Committee to be responsible for finding the basis for an agreement.

<h3 id="e26">On the Issue of Sanctions Against Italy, the United States Will Give an Official Reply to the League of Nations; Wording is Euphemistic and Does Not Make Direct Expressions; Only States That Maintaining Peace Remains Its Original Intention <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department will today give an official reply to the League of Nations regarding the United States' actions on the Abyssinian-Italian dispute and its general relationship with world peace. According to well-informed sources, the United States will not announce straightforward opinions. The wording of the reply will be euphemistic and leave the League of Nations to draw its own conclusions. The United States' reply will list the following facts: (1) The Abyssinian Emperor invoked the Pact of Paris on June 3; (2) Secretary of State Hull's warning to the Italian Ambassador that the United States had deep misgivings about Italian actions that might lead to war; (3) President Roosevelt's arms embargo order. Officials declared that the United States' arms embargo is a powerful expression of support for peace, so there will be no further action at present. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently made a statement to the press, stating, "The government will send out a reply soon after receiving the League of Nations' note on the implementation of sanctions against Italy. The attitude of the United States in its reply regarding the issue of sanctions will be based on the provisions of the neutrality laws, as the neutrality laws do not permit the government to take the same sanctions as the League of Nations." When asked whether the United States was prepared to prohibit the transport of gasoline and copper to belligerent countries, the President replied that if necessary, it would be considered. Asked about the naval shipbuilding issue, Roosevelt replied that he had not ordered the construction of new ships, as the United States' main battleships could only be replaced after the Washington Treaty expires in 1937 in accordance with treaty provisions.

<p>(Washington) Former Secretary of State Stimson of the Hoover administration met with current Secretary of State Hull for an hour today to discuss the League of Nations' request for the United States' views on the implementation of economic sanctions against Italy. Stimson's visit to Hull has caused much speculation here. Some observers believe that this conversation indicates that the government is now trying to avoid attacks from the opposition party on the government's policies toward the European situation. It is known that Stimson's trip to the State Department was at Hull's invitation. Stimson recently expressed his dissatisfaction that the United States had failed to cooperate with the League of Nations in dealing with the Abyssinian-Italian war. However, the stated purpose of this visit is related to the upcoming horse race in the United States, which Stimson is very interested in. American disarmament representative Davis also met with Hull and President Roosevelt one after another today. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e27">British Election Campaign Begins; Baldwin's Speech; The League of Nations Still Faces More Serious Tests; Military Blockade May Be Inevitable <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin gave his first election campaign broadcast speech tonight, stating that if all countries joined the League of Nations, then war could be prevented. Now that Germany, Japan, and the United States are outside the League of Nations, preventing war has become even more difficult. Under these circumstances, it is also expected that the League of Nations will encounter a period of testing, and the League of Nations may still have more serious tests in the future. If it is necessary to implement severe sanctions, then a blockade will ultimately be inevitable. This difficult responsibility will initially fall on the British Navy, and hopefully, it will be shared with the navies of other countries. If not, then it may have to be borne alone. Britain has led the world toward disarmament, but other countries have not followed suit, and have instead expanded their armaments, not only expanding them but also modernizing them. Moreover, several countries have increased their armaments to an enormous extent. We do not want to have a huge military force, but we want to modernize our armaments. The world should know that after the European War, Britain only built three main battleships, and the construction models of the remaining ships were all designed before attention had to be paid to aerial attacks. Britain's cruisers are mostly outdated and unsuitable for use in the new era. If I do not have the power to remedy the deficiencies in our national defense after the European War, then I cannot be responsible for the government's actions. We do not need a huge military force, but we must ensure that all our weapons are the most advanced in the world.</p>
<p>(London) The decree dissolving the current Parliament and convening a new Parliament on November 26 has been published in last night's London Gazette supplement. The headquarters of the various parties are now busy arranging campaign speeches for their party leaders, nominating candidates, and sending election materials to the various constituencies. There are a total of 615 seats in the House of Commons, and there are now as many as 1,270 candidates. The coalition parties have 563 candidates, including 498 from the Conservative Party, 42 from the National Liberal Party, 20 from the National Labour Party, and 3 from the "National Party." The opposition parties have a total of 710 candidates, including 530 from the Labour Party, 150 from the Liberal Party, and 30 from the Independent Labour Party. Sixty-two current members of the House of Commons do not wish to seek re-election, including 55 from the Conservative Party, including Countess Iveagh, Secretary of State for Scotland and Minister of the Navy Monsell, and Scottish Solicitor General Jamieson have been appointed as judges. The manifestos of the various parties have been published one after another. The Labour Party is appealing to voters to follow a fixed socialist direction. The Communist Party supports the restoration of the Labour Party government. The "National Unity" Party manifesto, signed by Baldwin, MacDonald, and Simon, will be published soon. Samuel advised his party members to vote in constituencies without "Samuel Liberal Party" candidates for candidates who support Lloyd George's policy of establishing a National Peace and Reconstruction Conference. Lloyd George gave a speech in Caernarfon today, criticizing the government for using the opposition parties' differences of opinion on the East African war to hold a general election, saying that Baldwin knew that there was no chance of a socialist government at this time, and that the danger of a "rascally majority" was even greater.

<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Tso-pin, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, visited Finance Minister Takahashi at 10:00 AM on the 26th, informing him of his upcoming return to China on the 31st and exchanged opinions on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Ambassador Chiang stated to the Finance Minister that the Chinese government greatly desires Sino-Japanese amity and is willing to implement economic cooperation. However, given the current national conditions in China, it hopes to implement economic cooperation within the scope of not losing the balance of Sino-Japanese trade. (26th Jiji Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After a meeting with Wu Tingchang of the Chinese Economic Inspection Group on the 25th, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters, "The result of the Chinese inspection group's visit to Japan is the establishment of a Sino-Japanese economic cooperation liaison organization. Japan will also organize an inspection group to visit China in return. Both are excellent measures to enhance amity between the two countries." (26th Jiji Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the Senate Silver Investigation Committee convened in Salt Lake City, silver experts believe that whether the issue of bimetallism can be raised in the 1936 general election depends on Senator Borah alone. Recent developments prove that Committee Chairman Pittman and other leaders who drafted the 1932 Democratic platform unanimously believe that the government's silver policy is satisfactory. At the same time, Senator Thomas has indeed expressed dissatisfaction with the government's policy. However, there is now a trend to promote managed currency. Some other silver senators, in order to pass the veterans' benefits bill in the next parliament, will probably advocate a paper money inflation policy. Conservatives within the Republican Party can hardly be expected to support the price ratio of sixteen to one for gold and silver. Therefore, if no Western senator with national renown comes forward to fight for it, the issue of bimetallism will likely fade into obscurity. Borah is clearly the only figure with the ability to attract national attention to the silver issue. Most recently, Borah has been evasive about the silver issue for some reason. However, according to those who returned from the Salt Lake City meeting, Borah was one of the most active in collecting materials for the meeting. (25th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Experts today declared that the stagnation of the world silver market has led merchants with excessive stockpiles to sell abroad, thus contributing to the drastic fall in the price of Chinese currency. Observers pointed out that the price of silver has been close to US$0.65 and three-quarters for several weeks, which shows that the US Treasury's purchase of silver is very ordinary. It has long been believed here that the Treasury would not accelerate the purchase of silver without pressure from the silver faction in Congress. However, the silver faction is very depressed because Congress is currently in recess. It is believed here that the reason for the drastic fall in the price of Chinese currency is that the general public cannot grasp the future currency policy of the Chinese government. (25th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The reason for the rise in silver prices in the New York market has not yet been announced. If China sells its silver reserves abroad due to political and financial reasons, the world silver price will inevitably plummet. Experts today told the Associated Press that China will eventually recover the silver purchased by the United States, and the price it pays per ounce will not exceed US$0.35. However, this will happen ten or fifteen years later. (25th Kuomintang News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A person in charge of the Beining Railway Bureau said that the intermodal transport of goods between inside and outside the customs was proposed by the Japanese side to the Chinese authorities. What was proposed was not concrete. Although the bureau has accepted the intention, how to reply is still under consideration. Reports that consultations are being held in Peiping and that the bureau has sent representatives to attend are not accurate. Even if this matter can be realized, it is expected that it will not be completed in the near future, because the procedures for customs duties and inspection have not been resolved, and intermodal transport is difficult to discuss. The Yuguan Exchange and Transit Bureau has suffered heavy losses recently due to the decrease in exchange between inside and outside the customs and the sharp drop in the value of currency outside the customs, resulting in conversion losses.

<p>Due to Central Government Funds Not Yet Remitted for the Closure Project</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Dongzhuang Yellow River project in Shandong is vast. According to the Dongzhuang meeting's decision principles, the closure committee estimated the construction plan and budgeted over 4.8 million yuan. The closure project alone requires over 1.3 million yuan. Regarding the construction funds, the central government has only remitted 300,000 yuan for disaster relief, leaving only 240,000 yuan. Han Fuqu, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, repeatedly requested to be relieved of the responsibility for the closure. The committee replied, urging him to persevere and promising to continue allocating 1 million yuan in construction funds, starting with 300,000 yuan. A total of 540,000 yuan has been received so far, plus 100,000 yuan in assistance from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, totaling 640,000 yuan. Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, was appointed as the chairman of the closure committee, leading the staff to actively prepare for the closure project, purchasing materials, and intensifying transportation. The Li Jingtun remnant revetment head and the extension of the Jiangsu Dam, and the construction of a diversion dam and other projects, started successively on the 15th and 20th of this month. They are currently working hard to complete the foundations of the east and west dams, and after the ice flood, they will take the opportunity to close the breach. However, the construction funds received for purchasing materials have long been exhausted. Now that the project continues to advance, funds are urgently needed. According to Zhou Li, director of the construction team, the purchase of materials requires 1,934,973.45 yuan. The bidding has been completed, and over 721,000 yuan must be paid before November 1st. After the closure committee submitted a report to Chairman Han Fuqu, Han has sent three telegrams in succession, urging the Economic Commission to remit the 700,000 yuan of the promised million yuan as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs. However, there has been no response to date. It is estimated that if the construction funds do not arrive in the next few days, the closure project will inevitably come to a standstill. According to Zhang Honglie, chairman of the closure committee, if the construction funds are not remitted within days, he will not be able to be responsible for the closure and will immediately submit his resignation, requesting that another capable person be appointed to replace him. It is also heard that Zhang has sent telegrams to Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Commission, and Kong Xiangrong, acting chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, stating this opinion.

<p>The breach in the No. 34 Levee extends for four to five kilometers.</p>
<p>The construction of a remote levee requires 80,000 laborers per day and will take five months to complete.</p>
<p>Xi Dejiong goes to Nanjing again to discuss the start of construction with the Economic Commission.</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the repair of the breach in the main Jiang-Xiang levee, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau previously convened a meeting and decided on a plan and steps to implement. First, work will start on the Zhongxiang No. 24 Levee on the Xiang River line, followed by the No. 11 Levee, and then the levees on the Yangtze River line. The No. 34 Levee suffered the most damage, and its location in the upper reaches is of great importance, so it is necessary to build it in advance. Xi Dejiong, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, went to the upper reaches of the Xiang River on the 20th by boat for a personal inspection for the sake of careful engineering, and returned to Hankou on the 25th. According to Xi, he arrived at Jiukou on the 22nd and landed on the 23rd to inspect the proposed levee line and the No. 34 Levee breach. From Jiukou via Shagang to Luojiaji Luohansi and then via Guanyintang Zhengjiaji to the No. 34 Levee breach mouth, the journey is over 70 li. Along the way, the villages passed through, after the great flood, mostly became ruins. The corpses of people and animals, doors, tables, chairs, and other objects washed away by the flood could be seen everywhere. From Zhengjiaji to the mouth of the No. 34 Levee breach, more than ten li is a stretch of sand, as if in the desert. The tragic situation of this year's flood and the severity of the damage can be imagined. The No. 34 Levee is located in the upper reaches of the Xiang River, commanding a high position. After the levee broke, the water flowed westward, affecting more than ten counties in the lower reaches of northern Hubei. The mouth is as wide as four or five kilometers. Looking at the south of the breach from afar, it forms a semi-circular shape with a stretch of sand in the south half. The water flowing from the north overflows, and there are more than ten breaches below, such as the No. 11 Levee, with the disaster being concentrated in one corner. The breach is so huge, that compared to the great disaster of the 20th year of the Republic and the Yellow River breaches over the years, it is even more severe. The restoration is not only a matter of hope for the post-disaster refugees, but also a concern for the people of the whole country. Those who care about levee policy know its importance. Although the restoration plan has been discussed and decided, with the construction of a remote levee as the principle, the location of the breach and interruption of flow still needs to be selected and compared. A survey team has been dispatched to conduct detailed surveys of the nearby terrain before a decision is made. The remote levee project at that location is approximately 18 kilometers long and requires more than 2 million cubic meters of earth. The average height of the levee body reaches more than 10 meters. It is planned to start construction in early November and be completed in March next year. On average, more than 80,000 workers are required every day. After construction starts, they will gather in one corner, plus the people involved, military police, and merchants, the number will reach more than 100,000. Taking food as an example, more than 1,000 dan of relief are needed every day to meet the supply. From this one aspect, one can imagine how huge the project is. In the 10th year of the Republic, E Shen Li Yinchen supervised the Wangjiaying closure project, possessing the special power to command the military and civilians of the entire province. It took more than eight months to complete. The current remote levee project is two-thirds larger than the Wangjiaying project, and the construction time is shorter, so the assistance of local people is needed to avoid delaying the work. Xi is scheduled to report to the provincial government on the 20th about the inspection, and will go to Nanjing again within days to report to the three standing committee members of the Economic Commission and Secretary-General Qin to discuss the progress. In any case, construction can start in early November. (25th)</p>

It is necessary to prepare for winter defense early to maintain local security. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 26th, he convened leaders from the military, police, and all sectors to hold a winter defense meeting, which was chaired by County Magistrate Wu.

<p>Changzhou Major Theft from Bank Safe Deposit Boxes</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Yixing branch of the Wujin Bank on April 1st of this year, the business has been relatively developed. At about 3:00 AM on the 24th of this month, the branch manager Tan Liangxi heard faint noises from the vault while sleeping. He thought it was rats or insects and did not suspect anything else. When he woke up in the morning and asked the servant Zhou Jinsheng to check, the door to the vault was already wide open. He rushed to inspect and saw that the safe deposit boxes had been damaged. The cash and silver dollars stored in the boxes, totaling 4,000 yuan, 490 yuan in fractional currency, plus 15 yuan in loose silver dollars, and 138 pieces of jewelry (weighing over fifty taels) were completely stolen, with a loss of approximately ten thousand yuan. A bowl of clean water containing iron rust was found under the boxes. Manager Tan, considering the seriousness of the matter, immediately reported to the Wujin headquarters by telephone. Deputy Manager Li Xing also went to Yixing by car to investigate the incident and reported it to the Yixing Public Security Bureau for investigation. According to news on the 25th, over 490 yuan in fractional currency and envelopes containing jewelry were found in a bamboo basket in the branch's kitchen, as well as a steel spiral drill with an arrow shape, with English words engraved on the drill. The servant Zhou Jinsheng, Little Sanzi, and the cook Lu Genbao, who were considered highly suspicious, were all sent to the Public Security Bureau for temporary custody.</p>
<p>Wuxi Telegraphic Request to Correct the Occupation of the Confucian Temple</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Education Bureau has been renting part of the old Fourth Township Office as its office for more than ten years. Starting last year, the county funds purchased a base behind the county court and deposited over 10,000 yuan for the construction of houses. Recently, after the new Director of Education Hui Meishan took office, he proposed to move the bureau and advocated that there was no need to build houses and that the saved construction funds should be used for other purposes. It was proposed and discussed at the first bureau affairs meeting, and it was decided to repair the houses in the two wings of the History Museum originally located in the Confucian Temple, and add straw houses to the front and rear gaps as the office location of the bureau. The original items stored in the museum were collected and stored in the Dacheng Hall for safekeeping. It was also submitted to the County Government Affairs Conference, and it was resolved that the Education Bureau and the Construction Bureau would send personnel to estimate the budget and bidding methods and submit them for approval. More than ten local gentry, including Hua Wenchuan and Gao Xiang, believe that the county bureau's actions clearly violate the National Government and Chairman Chiang's repeated orders to protect and worship the Confucian Temple, and the regulations of the Internal Affairs, Finance, and Education ministries on the management of Confucian Temple property. They jointly telegraphed the National Government, Chairman Chiang, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Education, requesting that they be clearly ordered to correct the situation and immediately dismiss the proposal to prevent absurdities. The Second Township Office in that location also moved into the Confucian Temple's Sage Shrine to conduct business without permission, and requested that the district chief of that district be severely punished to serve as a warning to those who defy the sages and laws.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Lottery for Repayment of Construction Bonds</p>

The winning numbers were "37" and "69", totaling 500,000 yuan in principal and interest, which will be paid and repaid by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Local Bank, and the treasuries of various counties starting from the end of this month.</p>
<p>Jingjiang Discovery of Malfeasance by the Former County Magistrate</p>
<p>Although the former county magistrate of this county, Li Jinfang, has been transferred for a long time, the cash books have not yet been transferred as ordered. The Finance Department Commissioner Zhu Anren arrived in Jingjiang and learned of this situation and immediately ordered Li's representative, Ke Zhang Shusheng, to hand them over as ordered. Ke refused to comply. County Magistrate Su was requested to place him under custody to force the handover. It was also discovered that Li Jinfang had privately deposited tax funds in money houses and banks to earn interest during his term of office. The bank passbooks have been handed over by Commissioner Zhu Anren to County Magistrate Su for safekeeping and reported to the Finance Department for instructions.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Deliberations on Dredging Yingtian River</p>
<p>After the Huangtiangang dredging is completed, there is still a port section that needs to be mechanically excavated. These expenses have been approved by the Construction Department to allocate over 10,000 yuan from the surplus construction funds for the 23rd year of the Republic, and over 6,000 yuan from the repair of the Tongjiang port gates, plus over 10,000 yuan from the Engineering Office's surplus funds. There is still an insufficient amount. The Construction Committee decided on the 24th to allocate all of the surplus funds from the construction funds for the 23rd year of the Republic. If it is still not enough, it will raise more funds. In addition, the Yingtian River has been silted up for years and should be dredged this winter. The estimated earthwork is over 700,000 cubic meters, and it was decided to complete the dredging in one go this year. Zhu Yuanzhuang, deputy engineer of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Construction Engineering Office, was ordered to inspect the various ports and gates in Cheng and proposed to build gates at Huangtiangang and Xiagang to control the water flow.</p>
<p>Bengbu Transport Department Orders Maintenance of Salt Rotation System</p>
<p>Bengbu is the only large salt market in northern Anhui. Its source is all transported from the Haizhou Banpu area of ​​northern Jiangsu. Because salt is abundant and the supply exceeds demand, there are occasional situations of rushing to sell it. In order to stabilize the salt market, the Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy's Office presented a request to the Ministry of Finance in the winter of the 21st year of the Republic, which was approved to implement a rotation sales system. At that time, the Xiaguan Inspection Bureau was notified that all stations in the Jinpei Southern Section except Bengbu and Mingguang were not allowed to release transportation. In order to resist private salt on the Liuan banks, Gu鎮 was opened out of necessity. The intention was originally to protect national taxes and people's food. However, Bengbu's salt must be entered into the warehouse for exchange rotation as a rule. Over time, the cost became heavier. Mingu’s salt is sold as soon as it arrives, with a lighter cost. Therefore, Bengbu's salt prices are difficult to be on par with Mingu. Most frustratingly, a few merchants transported and sold Mingu’s salt in Bengbu and the Hebei area. As a result, the rotation salt system was greatly affected. In order to maintain the Bengbu salt rotation sales system, the Salt Transport Envoy's Office recently telegraphed the tax collection office, ordering that salt, regardless of whether it is transported by vehicle, sea, or river, should be sold on a rotation basis according to its arrival in Bengbu. All salt from Mingguang and Guzhen should be sold at its designated sales bank. If it is transported and sold in Bengbu again, it will be ordered to stop selling it once it is verified.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The End of October is Approaching Soon; the Foundation of the Money Shops is Solid <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Discussion Focused on Returning the Financial Bonds Ordered by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The Reserve Treasury Has Strong Strength and Will Continue to Roll Over Long-Term Loans</p>
<p>The difficult end of October is approaching soon. The strength of the money shops in this city is unusually strong, so there is no need to worry about a smooth passage. The Ministry of Finance is urging the return of financial bonds, and the money shops have decided to do their best to return them. All long-term loans will be rolled over in accordance with the instructions. A reporter from the Industrial and Commercial News Agency has investigated and reported the following details:</p>
<p>Abundant Funds in the Money Shops</p>
<p>The 55 member shops belonging to the Money Shops Association, mindful of the financial turmoil at the end of April, which affected Shanghai's instability, held a general managers' meeting in the autumn to discuss how to maintain the industry and strengthen its strength in order to prevent problems before they arise. With the added attention of Mr. Qin Xieqing, General Manager of the Reserve Treasury, each shop was instructed to do its best to strengthen its financial reserves to prevent unforeseen circumstances. It is understood that the shops have recently increased their own reserves, with a large amount of deposits, so the reserves in the money shops are unusually abundant.</p>
<p>Returning Government Bonds</p>
<p>In May of this year, the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan of financial bonds to maintain the foundation of the money shops because of the financial turmoil in Shanghai. Afterwards, the shops have separately returned more than 9 million yuan, leaving more than 16 million yuan outstanding. Now, the Ministry of Finance believes that the money shops are unusually stable, so it has ordered the Money Shops Supervision Committee to send a letter urging the shops to repay the debt, and recommended Commissioner Qin Runqing to contact the association. The association, considering the importance of the matter, convened a meeting of managers and representatives at its office on Ningbo Road at 2:00 yesterday afternoon. More than 30 related shops, including Fuyuan, Zikang, Jintai, Tongrun, Anyu, Ankang, Yida, and Hengxun, attended. Mr. He Zhongxiao chaired the meeting, which lasted for about an hour before adjourning. It is understood that the meeting concluded that the government bonds urged for repayment by the Ministry of Finance would be partially repaid first due to the full rollover of long-term loans at the end of October, and the remaining amount would be repaid after the end of October.</p>
<p>Long-Term Rollover</p>
<p>Most of the long-term industrial and commercial credit loans extended by the member shops of the money shops at the end of October were rolled over at the end of April and should be repaid at the end of this month. However, according to the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, the Shanghai National Products Industry Association has sent a letter requesting further assistance for industrial and commercial development, and it has been decided to follow the ministry's instructions and roll over all long-term loans in order to maintain the original intention of relieving the market. The receipt and disbursement of funds has not been busy in recent days, and the market's foreign exchange rates are very low, at 1.5 cents yesterday morning and afternoon, which proves that the money shops are stable and the demand for funds is not high.</p>

<p>Unanimously Elected Chen Bingqian and Wen Qinfu as Plenipotentiary Representatives</p>
<p>The Guangdong Bank bondholders held a creditors' meeting at the Guang Zhao Public Hall on Ningbo Road at 4:00 yesterday afternoon. More than 100 people, including Wen Qinfu of the Guang Zhao Public Hall, Jiang Tianduo of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association, and Chen Bingqian of the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, attended. Chen Bingqian was unanimously elected as chairman to report that, according to the resolution of the creditors' meeting on October 14, opinions were solicited from the creditors on the proposal to support the resumption of business or liquidation. So far, replies have been received: 649,833.32 yuan supported the resumption of business, 16,620.08 yuan supported liquidation, and 2,073.93 yuan supported both liquidation and resumption of business. The majority supported the resumption of business, and the creditors were asked to express their opinions in order to proceed. After the chairman's report, the creditors expressed many opinions, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) As the Hong Kong National Bank is registered in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government should be requested to allow the creditors to manage the debts themselves in order to proceed; (2) A letter of support for the resumption of business and a letter of liquidation should be prepared and sent to the Hong Kong bondholders for unified handling; (3) Chen Bingqian and Wen Qinfu were elected as plenipotentiary representatives of the Shanghai branch bondholders and were solely responsible for handling the matter.

<p>Tomorrow is the 17th anniversary of the independence of the Czechoslovak Republic. Czechs all over the world will celebrate joyfully on this day. Czechoslovakia was established after the end of the European War. In the early years of its founding, enemies believed that this naive country would soon collapse. Later, seeing its national foundation become increasingly solid, they turned to astonishment. As for today, not only does no one envy or slander it, but they are also glad that the Czechoslovak Republic exists, because several neighboring countries rely on Czechoslovakia to be stable. Czechoslovakia is the only country in Central Europe that has not been infected by Bolshevism and the only country that has not depreciated its currency. In recent years, neighboring countries have either implemented a dictatorial system or abolished the parliamentary system. Only Czechoslovakia still maintains Western European democracy in the parliamentary system. Despite the global economic turmoil, its finances are still very stable and its foreign debts have been repaid without any default. In the 17 years since its founding, President Masaryk and Foreign Minister Dr. Beneš have continued to serve together, and their policies have been consistent. This is something that the rest of Europe cannot match. Czechoslovakia's policy focuses on good neighborliness and it is a major member of the Little Entente. The maintenance of peace in Central Europe relies heavily on its efforts, and it supports the League of Nations wholeheartedly. In the 17 years, through hard work, it has achieved today's prosperity, which is all due to the unity of the people from top to bottom, with one heart and one mind.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Promoting the Draft Bill on Acceptance Bills; the Loan Committee Has Revised It <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Letters Were Sent to the Banking and Money Shops and the Central Bank to Solicit Agreement</p>
<p>After Agreement is Obtained, it Will Be Submitted to the Ministry of Finance for Approval and Implementation</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee has completed the revision of the draft measures for promoting acceptance bills, which was passed at the 15th meeting. It has sent the revised text to the Banking and Money Shops Association, requesting them to solicit the consent of the lending banks and shops. At the same time, the committee directly sent a letter to the Central Bank to solicit its agreement, because the Central Bank is also one of the lending banks, but not a member of the Banking Association. A reporter from New New News has recorded the original letter and the original draft of the revised measures for promoting acceptance bills as follows:</p>
<p>Soliciting Agreement</p>
<p>The Loan Committee's letter to the Banking and Money Shops Association and the Central Bank stated: "Dear Sirs, it has been three months since the Industrial and Commercial Credit Small Loans allocated by the banking and money industries to our committee for review and release began to be processed. The amount released is only 200,000 yuan, less than one-tenth of the total amount. Our committee, understanding the situation, in order to further assist industry and commerce, encourage production, circulate domestic goods, and maintain the livelihood of workers, has discussed and decided to allocate 3 million yuan from the Industrial and Commercial Credit Small Loans recognized and borrowed by the banks and shops as a fund for promoting industrial and commercial acceptance bills. The draft measures for promoting acceptance bills were passed at the 15th meeting of our committee. Whether the allocation of funds to handle acceptance bills and the draft measures are feasible should be subject to the opinions of the lending banks and shops before being submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation. In addition to sending separate letters, we are enclosing a copy of the draft measures and (requesting) that (your bank agree and asking that you check and) (the association solicit the agreement of the lending banks and shops) and reply. In addition, regarding the organization entrusted to handle acceptance bills in Article 2 of the measures, our committee has discussed and proposed that the banks and shops that recognize and allocate small credit loans should be responsible for handling them separately. However, how to entrust the handling, whether to entrust all or part of the banks and shops to handle it, and whether the number of such bills handled by each bank and shop should be limited or unlimited, we hope that (your bank) (association) will check and provide detailed opinions to facilitate implementation. Yours sincerely, (Central Bank) Shanghai (Banking) (Money) Shops Association, Chairman Cai Zengji."</p>
<p>Revised Draft</p>
<p>Draft Measures for Promoting Acceptance Bills by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee: (1) In order to assist industry and commerce, encourage production, circulate domestic goods, and maintain the livelihood of workers, this committee, with the consent of the lending banks and shops, has requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to allocate 3 million yuan of national currency from the small credit loans as a fund for the acceptance and discount of industrial and commercial bills, and the government bonds allocated by the Ministry will still be used as the second guarantee. (2) The acceptance and discount of these bills shall be handled by the lending banks and shops entrusted by this committee, and all handling fees shall be borne by the applicant. (3) After the entrusted banks and shops submit the above-mentioned bills for review by this committee, the committee shall issue government bond receipts according to the amount as proof of the second guarantee. (4) The methods of acceptance and discount are as follows: (A) If an industrial or commercial enterprise stores raw materials or goods in a warehouse, and they have been identified as needed and valuable in the market and have gone through the transfer procedures, they may fill out a bank acceptance bill at the discount rate prescribed in these measures, and the entrusted bank or shop shall accept it. (B) If an industrial or commercial enterprise holds a commercial acceptance bill obtained from the sale of goods, it may apply to the entrusted bank or shop for discount. If the related parties of the above-mentioned bill have been verified to have considerable financial resources, they may be exempted from providing a guarantee. (C) The face value of the bill requested for acceptance by an industrial or commercial enterprise shall not exceed 60% of the estimated value of the goods provided as collateral for the bill specified in item A, and shall not exceed 5,000 yuan for the bill specified in item B.

The banks and shops handling the discount shall report the names and amounts of the discounters to the committee daily. (5) When a bank acceptance bill becomes due, the applicant shall pay the full amount to the entrusted bank or shop. If the applicant fails to pay, the entrusted bank or shop may, in addition to making a payment on its behalf, sell the raw materials or goods provided as collateral to offset the payment. If the amount is insufficient, it may also recover the amount from the related parties of the bill. (6) When a commercial acceptance bill becomes due, the acceptor shall pay the full amount. If the acceptor fails to pay, the entrusted bank or shop may, in addition to making a payment on its behalf, recover the amount from the related parties of the bill. (7) The amount of bill acceptance and discount shall be limited to 3 million yuan for the time being. If the applicant has already paid the amount when it becomes due, the committee may continue to handle acceptance and discount within its quota.

<p>Since the implementation of the new stamp duty regulations in September, the shipping companies in Shanghai have strongly opposed the 20-cent stamp duty on each bill of lading and sent representatives to Beijing to petition for a revision of the tax rate, which has been successfully resolved. This matter is related to shipping and transportation, so it is described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>Requesting Revision</p>
<p>Since September, all shipping merchants in Shanghai have asked the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association to send a telegram to the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing, requesting the revision of the article requiring a 20-cent stamp duty on each bill of lading, because some of the minimum bills of lading for cargo loaded by Shanghai ships only have a freight charge of 50 cents. According to the new stamp duty, the tax amount reaches 40%, which is rare and cannot be borne by the shipping merchants. The Legislative Yuan accepted the petition and agreed to open a finance committee to discuss and deliberate.</p>
<p>Representatives Attending</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, the Legislative Yuan held a finance meeting to discuss revising the amount of stamp duty on bills of lading in the new stamp duty. The Legislative Yuan specially invited representatives from Shanghai shipping merchants to attend in Beijing for consultation. The shipping merchants in Shanghai unanimously recommended Yuan Ludeng, Wei Wenhan, Wang Zigang, and others to go to Beijing. When the representatives went to Beijing, they provided the Legislative Yuan with the most powerful evidence by providing the smallest bill of lading of the shipping company, which was only 14 cents, for reference.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Resolution</p>
<p>The representatives stated in Beijing that the new stamp duty should change the method of affixing the tax amount to the bill of lading and reduce the tax rate. The Legislative Yuan also adopted this proposal. As a result of the discussion, a very satisfactory solution was reached. It is now agreed that: (1) Domestic cargo bills of lading will not be affixed with stamps, and the stamp duty will be affixed to the customs duty bill; (2) Inland cargo will have the stamp duty affixed to the bill of lading due to tax exemption, and the tax rate is very low; (3) Cargo transported abroad must have stamps affixed to the bill of lading. The representatives achieved their goals and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Marine Loss Expert</p>
<p>Marine loss calculation is a specialized subject, and our country has never had such talent. Whenever an accident occurs, foreign merchants must be asked to handle the calculation of marine losses. Mr. Wei Wenda has personally gone to various countries in Europe and America to study marine losses. Mr. Wei has interned in major insurance companies in Europe and America for many years and has returned to China after completing his studies. Shipping merchants in this port are preparing to hold a meeting to welcome him. In the future, if Chinese ships have maritime accidents, the calculation of marine losses can be entrusted to domestic experts instead of relying on foreigners.</p>

<p>Last afternoon, the Mayor hosted a banquet for all members of the delegation.</p>
<p>Diplomatic and industrial authorities from both China and Japan offered congratulatory messages.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese Industrial and Political Delegation to China, led by Dr. Kyoichiro Inoue, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday at noon, Mayor Wu of this city held a banquet at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society to welcome the delegation. After the banquet, a lecture meeting was held, presided over by He Baicheng. Diplomatic representatives from both China and Japan offered congratulatory messages. From the Japanese side, Hiroshi Maruyama gave a speech, and from the Chinese side, Zhao-huan Li delivered a lecture. The meeting adjourned around 4 p.m. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Mayor's Banquet: Yesterday at noon, Mayor Wu hosted a special banquet at the dining hall of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Avenue Foch, to welcome the delegation. He also invited prominent figures from various circles in China and Japan to attend. Mayor Wu delivered the welcoming speech, translated by Guangfang Zeng. Then, Dr. Inoue, the leader of the delegation, gave a reply, translated by Xiu Wang. Guests and hosts mingled cordially during the banquet, which concluded at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>List of Delegation Members: The members of the Industrial and Political Delegation to China include: Masasuke Ide (Executive Director of the Automobile Manufacturing Company), Sukenozuke Hayashi (Major General, Director of the Osaka Army Arsenal), Tsuyoshi Kajii (Director of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Lecturer at Tokyo University), Eisuke Yoshida (Trustee of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry), Naoki Takada (President of the Japan Industrial Association), Hiroshi Maruyama (Professor, Doctor of Literature at Nihon University), Morio Nakamatsu (Director of the Imperial Invention Association), Ryuji Yamada (Director of the Research Institute of the Minister's Secretariat of the Railway Ministry), Taketaro Matsuda (Rear Admiral of Naval Aviation, Head of the Japan Engineering Association), Ko Matsunaga (Permanent Member of the Industrial Conference, Executive Director of the Industrial and Political Association), Tsutomu Mihara (Vice Admiral of Naval Ordnance, Doctor of Engineering, Director of the Technical Research Institute of the Ministry of the Navy), Shigesada Sugi (Director and Chief Engineer of Sumitomo Metal Industries), Shuhei Iwamoto (Professor at Tokyo University, Member of the Aeronautical Research Institute), Shinji Kawahara (Agricultural and Forestry Technician of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry), Juichiro Motono (Professor of Engineering at Kyushu University), Takenosuke Miyamoto (Doctor of Engineering, Technical Official of the Ministry of Interior), and others.</p>
<p>Guests at the Banquet: Those invited by Mayor Wu to attend included Ambassador Arima, Consul General Ishii, and other Japanese officials, leaders from business, cultural, and artistic circles in Shanghai; from the Chinese side, university presidents, deans, leaders of academic organizations, heads of cultural institutions, members of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, figures from banking and commercial sectors, totaling over seventy people, were personally hosted by Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: At the banquet, Mayor Wu delivered a welcoming speech, stating: "Ambassador Arima, Dr. Inoue, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, today we gather leaders from the academic and business communities of this city to welcome the Japanese Industrial and Political Delegation. As the host, I have prepared a modest feast to entertain you, and I am deeply delighted. The Japanese Industrial and Political Association is a highly reputable academic organization in Japan. The delegates are all renowned figures in academia. Dr. Inoue, the leader of the delegation, is a Doctor of Engineering and former Minister of Railways. His knowledge and experience have long been admired. It is a great honor to hear his insights today. This visit to Shanghai to hold academic lectures, with the depth of knowledge of these gentlemen, will undoubtedly provide valuable and specialized insights for the benefit of the academic community of this city. In modern times, academic pursuits in various countries have broken through the barriers of national boundaries and established close international connections. Although each nation has its unique characteristics, special national conditions, and different needs, based on the principle that 'stones from other mountains can polish jade,' no nation should 'shut itself off,' and no cultured nation should 'be self-righteous.' The progress of human culture in the past was largely due to mutual learning, mutual refinement, mutual borrowing, and mutual emulation. The future progress of world culture must depend on human mutual assistance and cooperation. Therefore, mutual assistance and cooperation are the ultimate goals of human evolution, while jealousy and strife are the sources of cultural destruction. China and Japan share the same script and are of the same race. In the past, the progress of culture, academics, economy, and society in both countries cannot deny the historical connection of mutual assistance and cooperation. Today, I have organized this grand gathering, hoping that the academic circles of China and Japan will not neglect this valuable historical connection, thoroughly recognize the ultimate goal of human evolution, and strive for the progress of Eastern national culture and academics in the spirit of cooperation. In particular, we should base our efforts on the virtue of mutual assistance to lay the foundation for peace in East Asia."</p>
<p>Inoue's Response: After Mayor Wu's welcoming speech, Dr. Inoue delivered a response, stating: "Today, nations are basing their foundations on industry. The two neighboring countries of East Asia should jointly develop industry. If both governments and peoples can adopt Western culture and integrate it with inherent Eastern culture, then in the future they will surely surpass the civilizations of Europe and America. Seeing the current international situation, it is not enough for just one country in East Asia to strive for progress. It is necessary for both countries to seek joint development in order to advance East Asian civilization. This visit to China is entirely based on this purpose. First, to exchange research and experience in academics between the two countries. Second, for both countries to work together to seek connections in industrial technology, increase the welfare of the East Asian people, and contribute to lasting peace. To achieve these goals, we are willing to fully share the difficulties and experiences that Japan has encountered in its past efforts with China for reference."</p>
<p>Opening of the Lecture Meeting: After the banquet hosted by Mayor Wu, the lecture meeting commenced, with Mayor Wu appointing He Baicheng as the chairman. The chairman delivered the opening remarks.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman He Baicheng delivered the opening remarks, saying: "Director Inoue, Mayor Wu, members of the Industrial and Political Delegation to China, distinguished guests from China and abroad, today the Japanese Industrial and Political Delegation to China and distinguished guests are holding an academic lecture meeting here. I am honored to be appointed chairman by Mayor Wu. Before announcing the purpose of the meeting, I would like to express a few thoughts in my capacity as chairman. First, we should thank Mayor Wu for not only treating us to a sumptuous feast but also giving us this good opportunity to exchange ideas. Second, we should welcome all the distinguished guests from China and abroad who are attending today, especially the members of the Industrial and Political Delegation to China who have come from afar. Third, we should especially welcome the two experts who are giving lectures today. I dare to predict that their lectures will be very valuable. The work of the interpreter is also something that cannot be done well without specialized scholars. We are very fortunate to have Mr. Zeng Guangfang here today to take on this role, and we should also welcome him. There is one more point that has caused me a personal and interesting difficulty. Today, I am not only the chairman of the lecture meeting but also the chairman of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society. Since we are holding the meeting at the headquarters of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, I must also, as the chairman of the board of directors of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, take this opportunity to represent the board of directors of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society and express our welcome to all the guests. At the same time, I must also, as the chairman of the meeting, represent today's guests and express our gratitude to the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society for lending us the venue. Now, let me continue to briefly explain the purpose of today's meeting. We all know that the various Eastern nations, although they have had a high level of civilization for thousands of years, have always had the problem of overemphasizing the spiritual aspects. For example, the three major thought trends of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism in the East, although extremely noble and profound, inevitably focus on moral or spiritual cultivation and neglect material development. In order to adapt to the modern environment, we Easterners should devote some energy to the study of material things. Today's lecture meeting can be said to be a concrete demonstration of this trend. Secondly, the National Government and people of China are well aware of the importance of material construction and have been working hard to do so. For example, in recent years, the construction of aviation, railways, and highways has achieved remarkable results, which have been praised by Chinese and foreign people alike. However, in this era of rapid scientific progress, we must often exchange new experiences and valuable theories with experts from other countries to serve as reference for everyone. Today's lecture is an exchange of this kind of new experience and theory. Furthermore, we all know that the industry of our Eastern neighbor, Japan, is very developed, and it has made remarkable progress, especially in engineering construction. The members of the Industrial and Political Delegation to China who are attending today are all pioneers in this field. Their experiences of success and failure in this field are of particular value to China because of our shared language and culture. Therefore, today's lecture meeting can be said to be a gathering to promote material construction and exchange engineering knowledge. We can obtain a lot of valuable reference materials from this, so that the nations in our Eastern civilization system can keep pace and reach the stage of modernization. In addition, I believe that the international equality, understanding, and goodwill that Mayor Wu mentioned at the banquet can only be fully and effectively achieved through this noble work of knowledge exchange. This is the purpose of our meeting today. Now, because time is precious, we should begin to follow the scheduled agenda and invite the two experts to give their lectures. Before the lectures, we must first read the congratulatory telegrams from the authorities of the Chinese and Japanese governments to all the guests. We should first thank the Chinese and Japanese government authorities for their encouragement. Furthermore, today's newspapers reported that Mr. Li Zhao-huan was injured in an accident and therefore could not attend the meeting. We express our regret and condolences. Fortunately, he has already submitted his manuscript, which he entrusted to Mayor Wu to pass on to the delegation."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang's Speech: After the Chairman's speech, Gao Zongwu, Director of the Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representing Wang Zhaoming, who also served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, read the welcoming speech, saying: "Japan's rapid advancement in industry and the excellence of its manufacturing quality in recent years have been recognized worldwide. Therefore, our people deeply admire the Japanese people's technical genius and their diligent pursuit of science. The visiting gentlemen of the Industrial and Political Delegation to China are all leaders in the academic and industrial fields. I hope that after their observations, they will present their great theories and provide enlightenment. Our country is currently in a transitional era, and there is no other way to save the country than through science. I hope that our academic community will learn from the virtuous, think about aligning themselves, and be able to catch up, and sharpen their research, and use what they have learned to serve the country. Then the backwardness of the industrial world can be remedied with science, and the construction of the national economy can gradually achieve its success. The visit of the Industrial and Political Delegation to China will not only enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries, but it will also contribute to the development of the future of our country's industry. I respectfully offer this blessing and wish you all good health. October 26, 1935, Wang Zhaoming, Minister of Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister's Speech: Then, Ambassador Arima read the congratulatory message from Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota: "On the occasion of the Japanese Industrial and Political Delegation's visit to the Republic of China, with the support of various circles in both China and Japan, and the opening of an open and joint lecture meeting under the joint authority of the academic communities of both countries today, it is truly a cause for celebration and congratulation. Looking back, I must say that there have been some regrettable missed opportunities for joint academic research, which is the most important thing for the development of humanities in the relationship between China and Japan. On the other hand, there is a lack of this kind of cooperation among the people, which has led to some estrangement in the relations between the two countries. This is something that the Minister deeply regrets. This state of affairs is like burying valuable books in the ground, or storing good rice and wealth in a warehouse. This is not because of loyalty to the truth and one's own country. Several years ago, at the International Industrial Conference in Tokyo, even though the relationship between China and Japan was still in a difficult period, many of your country's scholars humbly and frankly participated, which is enough to prove the enthusiasm of your country's scholars for the truth. We were already admiring them at that time. If we remove the emotions of the moment and follow the eternal historical laws, and remove the partial views and observe the overall situation from a high place, we can easily see that China and Japan should always have a relationship of mutual literature, mutual understanding, and mutual support. The ancients said that sincerity and rectifying the heart are the right ways to cultivate morality, and investigating things to attain knowledge is the way to pursue science. These two are originally two sides of the same coin and should not be biased. However, the problem of modern times lies in bias, and what East Asia is worried about is the lack of science. The independence of East Asia can only be achieved after the independence of East Asian industry is established, and the independence of East Asian industry can only be achieved after the scientific skills that East Asia lacks are fulfilled. The ancients said it well, 'Without education, there is no country.' For the past thousand years, our country has been striving to hone our original face by borrowing from your culture's annotations and reflections. Now, within the fields of pure science and applied engineering, we have reached the world's standards. If your country's government and people humbly and frankly recognize and accept this scientific ability of neighboring Japan, and both rely on each other, they can realize the development of a new civilization that is both refined and substantial, and that is both spiritual and material. This is something that the Minister firmly believes. However, this can be said to be the common obligation that we East Asia should bear within the broad community of the world. October 26, 1935, Foreign Minister Koki Hirota."</p>
<p>Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry's Speech: Consul General Ishii also read the congratulatory message from Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Genji Matsuda, saying: "Today, at this time of an academic lecture meeting under the joint authority of the industrial circles of China and Japan, I feel very honored to have the opportunity to offer my respectful congratulations. The countries of East Asia have had close relations since ancient times, and their cultural exchanges have had a significant impact on each other. This is something that I don't need to elaborate on here. Especially in the recent situation, I feel the need for cooperation among the countries of East Asia. However, at this time, with the aim of contributing to the connection and cooperation of Eastern industrial technology and academics, it is timely and very beneficial to the Eastern industrial world to hold a joint lecture meeting between the two countries. This is certain and there is no doubt about it. The gentlemen participating in this meeting, please be aware of the purpose of this meeting, exchange your academics and knowledge with each other, and hope to achieve a very satisfactory result, so as to contribute to the upward development of Eastern industrial culture. This is what I most hope for. October 26, 1935, Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Genji Matsuda. There was also a congratulatory message from Chen Gongbo, Minister of the Ministry of Industry, representing Vice Minister Liu Weichi (omitted).</p>
<p>Academic Lectures: Then, the Chairman introduced Dr. Hiroshi Maruyama, a Doctor of Literature from Japan, and Li Zhao-huan, President of Jiaotong University, to give their lectures. Dr. Maruyama's lecture was titled "Industrial Education in Japan," and Mr. Li's lecture was titled "The Relationship between Engineering and Industry." Mr. Li was injured in a car accident the day before and was unable to attend, so he submitted his lecture manuscript to Mayor Wu to be forwarded to the delegation. (The speeches of both parties will be published separately.) At the end, Chairman He Baicheng delivered the closing remarks, saying: "Distinguished guests, now Mr. Hiroshi Maruyama's lecture has come to an end. Although we only had one gentleman's lecture, it was indeed able to fully express the purpose I described in my opening remarks. I believe that all the guests who attended today feel the same as I do, feeling very happy and very admirable. I now, in my capacity as chairman, express my gratitude to Mr. Hiroshi Maruyama on behalf of everyone, and congratulate them on the success of the lecture. At the same time, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the several lecturers for their hard work, and the guests for their enthusiastic participation and unwavering attendance. Now we will adjourn the meeting, and I hope to see you all again tomorrow."</p>
<p>Continuing Today: After the meeting, Dr. Inoue, the leader of the Industrial and Political Delegation to China, asked Mayor Wu to convey to all the Chinese guests who attended yesterday that they are still invited to attend the banquet hosted by the delegation at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society today for a friendly gathering, and to hold the second day of the lecture meeting. Ying, a professor at Tongji University in China, will lecture on "Industry in Shanghai," and Mr. Shuhei Iwamoto, a graduate in science from Japan, will lecture on "Japanese Aviation."</p>
<h3 id="e108">Continued News of the Two Ships in Distress: "Xin Feng" Towed Out... "Hai Hua" Salvaged <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>"Xin Feng" Towed to Safety</p>
<p>It was reported in yesterday's news that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Xin Feng" encountered a hurricane, breaking its propeller shaft and losing a propeller blade, causing the ship to drift. On the evening of the 25th, the "Xin Feng" drifted to 35 degrees 05 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees 10 minutes east longitude, where it anchored, and the wind subsided slightly. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company immediately ordered the "Rui Shan" to sail from Lianyungang at 7 p.m. on the 25th. It arrived at the "Xin Feng's" location at 11 a.m. on the 26th and began towing it at noon yesterday. At 6:25 p.m., the "Xin Feng" was towed out and is now sailing towards Shanghai. Kangzhenji has sent a tugboat to wait outside the Wusongkou. Once the "Xin Feng" arrives, it will be towed into the Huangpu River, berthed at the South Bund Wharf to unload cargo, and then sent to the factory for repairs. However, the seas near Qingdao are still rough, and it is estimated that it will not arrive until this afternoon.</p>
<p>Surveying "Hai Hua"</p>
<p>Ji Chuanfang, the general manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Hai Hua," which sank after hitting a reef in Qingdao Port due to the wind, as reported in this newspaper, took the Jinpu train to Jinan yesterday morning to transfer to the Jiaoji train to Qingdao in order to personally survey the sinking of the "Hai Hua" and determine the strategy for salvage or abandonment.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association Held Its 6th Annual General Meeting <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Discussed Solutions to Mitigate the Impact of Smuggled Cigarettes on Business. The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association held its 6th Annual General Meeting at the Central Western Restaurant on 4th Avenue at 2 p.m. yesterday to discuss solutions to mitigate the impact of smuggled cigarettes on business. Details of the meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Members: Shen Weiting (Cuizhong), Gu Zhongying (Huapin), Wang Xingchong (Ruilun), Xie Ruiyang (Asia), Ju Gengsheng (Lixing), Wang Weilin (Ruilun), Qiu Tanglin (Great Southeast), Wu Linzhi (Hexing), Ge Xiongfu (Fuxin), Yao Weixiong (Hexing), Shen Dexing (Huacheng), Dai Gengxin (Huacheng), Wang Junzhi (Nanyang), Sun Lishan (Great East), Zhang Xinliang (Great Southeast), Tao Wenkui (Dexing), Shen Yankang, Wang Weiguan (Zhongnan), Shi Quan (Jiangzhe), Yao Shushen (Great East), Wu Peiyin (Youcheng), Li Xuedong (Huadong), Xia Richuan (Huapin), Wang Jisong (East China Sea), Chou Guanquan (Youli), Jing Yimeng (Huamei), Yu Luxin (Luxin), and Zhu Ya Kui, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Sun Mingqi, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Jiang Yongyi, section chief of the Tax Office, and Chen Yan'yin, representative of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, were present to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: After the meeting was opened as usual, Shen Weiting, Ge Xiongfu, and Shen Dexing were elected as the presidium. First, Chairman Shen Weiting reported, roughly stating that Chinese cigarette manufacturing has been declining to the extreme since its inception. The reasons can be divided into three points: (1) The overall economic downturn has affected business, resulting in sluggish sales; (2) Social economic bankruptcy and the livelihood of the common people are difficult, so hand-rolled cigarettes are rampant, which affects the cigarette business; (3) Since the British American Tobacco Company depreciated and dumped its products, Chinese cigarette factories have been unable to resist due to limited capital. All of these reasons are enough to promote the decline of Chinese cigarettes. In the future, we hope that everyone will work together to save the crisis of Chinese cigarettes, etc. Then, Shen Dexing reported on the income and expenditure for the past year, Ge Xiongfu reported on the association's affairs for the past year, and Sun Mingqi, the representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Jiang Yongyi, the section chief of the Tax Office, gave encouraging speeches.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: Then, the discussion began. (1) Due to the sluggish business relationship, the proposal to cancel the Lunar New Year gift of monthly spleen was passed in principle and handed over to the Executive Committee for detailed discussion and handling. (2) How to deal with the impact of smuggled cigarettes on business was resolved to be decided by the Executive Committee. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e110">General Overview of This Year's Flood Relief <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Briefing by the Central Relief Committee and the Charity Relief Association</p>
<p>This year, the rivers were flooded, and the victims were all over the fields. The tragic situation is unbearable to describe. Compared with the flood of the past ten years, it is even worse. The affected provinces include Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Jiangsu. Xu Shiying, the head of the delegation, personally went to inspect and received reports from the local authorities of the provinces. The affected counties and cities numbered 239, with an affected area of about 142,000 square kilometers. The number of affected people reached more than 20 million, and public and private losses are estimated to be more than 800 million yuan. In addition, there were also floods and droughts in Fujian, Guangdong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia. The water in Shandong has not yet receded, and Jiangsu, as the tail of the Yellow River, is expanding. This is the general situation of the affected provinces.</p>
<p>The Central Government is concerned about the flood victims and is in charge of relief. People from all walks of life in society are working together to provide assistance. First, the Central Government approved 1 million yuan of national currency from the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund and handed it over to the Relief Committee to work with the Ministries of Interior and Finance to allocate it to Hubei and other provinces to handle emergency relief and epidemic prevention. The Relief Committee also distributed in batches the relief funds donated from domestic and foreign sources and the relief donations remitted back by overseas Chinese, as they were received. As of October 21 of this year, a total of 340,278.69 yuan of national currency has been distributed to the provincial governments, provincial relief committees, the Relief General Association, and the Inner Mongolia Political Council in seven batches. The Shanghai Charity Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces allocated 540,000 yuan of national currency to nine provinces, including Hubei, for emergency relief. It hired heads of investigation and relief from various provinces to directly handle investigation and release matters, and repeatedly distributed 32,619 pieces of clothing and 348,468 pieces of emergency medicines to various provinces. This is the general situation of the relief work that the association has already carried out.</p>
<p>The Central Government is currently planning to issue 20 million yuan of disaster relief bonds. Other measures, such as the deduction of salaries of civil servants to assist in relief, may raise about 4 to 5 million yuan, which will all be used to handle work relief, cultivation relief, and agricultural relief in various provinces in the future.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Charity Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces has been making every effort to raise funds. In the autumn of social and economic depression, it has received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, who have been frugal and brave in doing what is right. As of October 22 of this year, it has received a total of 273,659.76 yuan of national currency. However, the weather is now cold, and the severe winter is approaching. The victims in the disaster areas are without clothing or food, and relief is urgently needed. We are grateful that the organizers of the 6th National Games and the athletes from various provinces are concerned about the victims and held a swimming disaster relief performance on October 21 to raise money for relief. On the 26th, they held a football disaster relief performance, and we deeply appreciate their kindness and righteousness. We also thank the gentlemen and ladies from all walks of life for their enthusiastic participation and respectfully thank them on behalf of the more than 20 million victims.</p>
<p>It should be further emphasized that this year's flood is particularly severe, the disaster area is vast, and the victims are numerous, crying out for help and waiting to be rescued. In addition, the rebuilding of the Yangtze River embankment and the blocking of the Yellow River mouth are both urgent matters. We hope that our elders, brothers, sisters, uncles, and aunts will embrace the spirit of rescuing those who are drowning and fulfill their wish to save the people and the country by providing more assistance in terms of relief funds and supplies. This is what the victims pray for day and night.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Suspect in the Chien Teh Bank Case: Ou Jiancheng Flees; Court Strictly Pursues Guarantor to Fulfill Guarantee Obligation; Chen Xifu Avoids Confinement by Residing in His Hometown, Never Appearing in Court <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Directors of the failed Chien Teh Bank, Chai Chuan-kuei and Supervisor Li Ching-wei, et al., were previously accused by the bank's creditors of fraud, etc. The First Special District Court has already rendered a preliminary judgment, imposing fines separately. For the four defendants who have consistently evaded, Ou Jiancheng, Chen Xiwu, Chen Fu-yi, and Zheng Huaigu, the trial has been temporarily suspended. It was later found that Ou Jiancheng did have a definite address in Shanghai and that he had already been sentenced to one year in prison by the First Special Court in a previous case involving the failed Wing On Bank, and was released on bail. Chen Xifu is hiding in his hometown of Yongkang County, Zhejiang Province. Neither is a person of uncertain whereabouts, so there is no need to suspend the trial. Therefore, the First Special Court issued summons. The defendants' defense lawyers were also instructed to inform their clients to surrender to the court pending trial. However, every time the court was scheduled to convene, Ou Jiancheng initially claimed to be ill. Upon hearing that the court had decided to send a forensic doctor to his home for examination, he fled in advance. Chen Xifu initially replied to his lawyer in a letter, stating that he would come to Shanghai to invest. However, he ultimately failed to keep his promise, and his whereabouts are now unknown. Yesterday afternoon, the court was scheduled to convene again. Judge Liu Yugui, because the defendants repeatedly failed to appear, asked Chen Xifu's lawyer in detail about Chen's Yongkang address to facilitate legal processing. Because Ou Jiancheng had already fled, the lawyer defending Ou did not appear in court yesterday. The court believes that Ou has already posted a satisfactory bond in another case, and now that Ou has indeed fled, the guarantor should be responsible. It is said that the court has been strictly pursuing the guarantor to fulfill the guarantee obligation in recent days. Therefore, the Chien Teh case will not be reopened until Ou and Chen, etc., are apprehended.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Using Forged Bills of Lading to Extract Rayon for Auction, a Total of Thirty Boxes Worth 15,000 Yuan; Zhang Jiaming Returned to Custody, Sentencing Scheduled <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jiaming, a Ningbo native collecting accounts for the Arnhold Trading Company on Szechuan Road, colluded with Wang Yi (who is at large) between June 3rd of this year to use forged bills of lading to send thirty boxes of rayon worth 15,000 yuan from the Arnhold Trading Company to the Lee Kee Auction House on Szechuan Road. Chen Bingzhang, a local who managed money, opened the boxes, changed the wrapping paper, and auctioned them off at a nominal price of 8,250 yuan. Afterwards, Zhang received a commission of 130 yuan, Wang gave a reward of 300 yuan, and Chen received a special commission of 30%, totaling 2,470 yuan. After the incident was discovered, Chinese Detective Jin Guanya of the Hongkew Police Station arrested Zhang and Chen successively and sent them to the First Special District Court. Their confessions have already been recorded in this newspaper. Zhang Jiaming was taken into custody, and Chen Bingzhang was released on a shop guarantee of 3,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xie-fen opened the Criminal Court Three to continue the trial. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that several witnesses from the Arnhold Trading Company and the Lee Kee Auction House had arrived in court and requested to be questioned. According to Chen Jigen, who works as a clerk at the Arnhold Trading Company, when the warehouse inventoried its stock at the end of June, it was discovered that thirty boxes were missing due to forged bills of lading. Mr. Flower of the west testified that rayon wooden boxes only have a triangular "wheat head" mark. The inner wrapping paper had twenty-five packages per box, and all had the "tiger" trademark. Next, Huang, the translator of Lee Kee Auction House, testified that he knew Zhang Jiaming. On that day, he and a customer named Zhao came and entrusted them to auction thirty boxes of rayon without the Arnhold Trading Company's mark. The commission was charged according to regulations at 75 yuan per thousand. Later, the money obtained from the auction was transferred by Chen Jiawu to Zhang Jiaming, etc. According to the staff member Lu Chang, the rayon was sent around 5:00 PM on June 3rd. The manager, Lee Kee Sheng, ordered the shop staff to open the boxes and change the wrapping paper for auction. According to the shop staff Zhao Qinan, the boxes had no Arnhold brand, only small marks. According to a Western employee named Zhu, the rayon wooden boxes and replacement wrapping paper were taken home by the manager after the fact and burned as firewood. The defendant Zhang Jiaming confessed that Chen Bingzhang knew the source of the goods completely. At that time, he gave the Westerners ten yuan and told him to find unmarked paper to rewrap the rayon. The work was completed around 8:00 PM. The money from the auction was delivered by him and Huang Ai-ting. Chen Bingzhang confessed that the rayon rewrapping was proposed by the manager, Lee Kee Sheng. According to Mr. Flower, the Western employee, the original wrapping paper had the Arnhold Chinese and Western characters in addition to the tiger trademark. Judge Xiao instructed the lawyer from the Public Works Department, Zhang, and the defendant's agent lawyers, Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng, to argue once and ordered Zhang Jiaming to be returned to custody. Chen Bingzhang was released on his original bail, and sentencing was scheduled for next Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Woman Mao Zhiqing Sues Silk Merchant Zhang Zihe for Immorality and Abandonment; Zhang Zihe Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Mao Zhiqing, a woman from Zhenjiang, is currently twenty years old and resides at No. 41, Juqing Lane, Xinzha Road. She recently retained lawyer Yang Huchen to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Zhang Zihe, who is engaged in the silk business, of immorality and abandonment. The gist of her lawsuit is that Zhang Zihe, with the introduction of Mr. and Mrs. Xi Rongsheng and Zhu Baozhu, proposed marriage to the plaintiff. On December 22nd of last year, he tricked her into signing a document and cohabiting. Initially, their relationship was harmonious and they loved each other very much. However, because Zhang did not complete the marriage formalities, the plaintiff attempted suicide on April 30th of this year and was revived after emergency treatment. On July 18th, the defendant also sent a letter to the plaintiff's parents, stating that he would hold a formal wedding ceremony in the shortest possible time. Because the plaintiff was deceived by sweet words, she patiently waited. Unexpectedly, the defendant left and never returned after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Not only did he abandon his former feelings, but he also did not care about her daily life, which is tantamount to abandonment. The plaintiff is in a foreign land, with no way to borrow money, and is weak and ill, so she is waiting for death. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's actions have violated Article 229, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, the crime of immorality, and Article 294 of the same law, the crime of abandonment. In addition to requesting the court to summon the defendant for interrogation, she also filed a civil suit, stating that because the defendant has assets of more than 100,000 yuan, he should be ordered to pay compensation of 20,000 yuan and living expenses of 100 yuan per month from September until the date of enforcement. The court approved the request. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide came to Criminal Court One to summon the defendant. The defendant did not appear, nor did a lawyer appear on his behalf. Judge Feng briefly questioned the plaintiff, Mao Zhiqing, and ordered the case to be rescheduled for November 1st at 3:00 PM to summon the defendant to appear in court for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Man from Gongxing Lane Abandoned Child's Corpse, Sentenced to Punishment; Yang Sirens Sentenced to Three Months, Suspended for Two Years <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Wang Zhushi, a Ningbo woman aged 38, residing at No. 120, Sheng Sheng Lane, South Qianjiatang, French Concession, is a lacquer worker. She has four children, boys and girls. Her youngest, the fourth daughter, was just born in July of this year. Due to congenital deficiencies, she was often ill and unable to afford medical treatment. She died at around 11:00 AM on the 23rd. Because Wang Zhushi could not afford a coffin and, as a woman, did not know the way or where to abandon the child's corpse, she found an old straw mat, wrapped the child's corpse, paid six jiao, and hired Yang Siren (48 years old, from Shandong), who lived in Gongxing Lane nearby, to take the child's corpse out for abandonment, promising to pay him a reward when her husband returned home in the evening. Yang then carried the straw mat containing the child's corpse out and abandoned it in an open space on Radou Road and Remy Road, not far away, at 4:00 PM that afternoon. He was discovered by a Vietnamese policeman who, suspecting a violation of regulations, took Yang to the police station. After hearing the story, the police chief sent Detective Yin Baoke to bring Wang Zhushi to the station. The child's corpse was sent to the morgue of the Tongren Hospital for examination. The next day, a report was submitted to the Second Special Court. Judge Wang Ren went to the scene and confirmed that the child had died of illness and ordered the Tongren Hospital to bury the body. The police station then sent Wang Zhushi and Yang Siren to Criminal Court One of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. Attorney Gu Shouxi of the Police Department presented the case, filing a public prosecution for the crime of abandoning a corpse. After Judge Zhang Chaozuo questioned the defendants, he immediately announced the verdict in court, sentencing Yang Siren to three months of imprisonment, suspended for two years, and Wang Zhushi was found not guilty. After the judgment was rendered, both defendants were released in court.</p>

<p>Zhu Dalong, the eight-year-old son of Zhu, a resident of Taiyuan Lane, Zhangjia Lane, Linping Road, Zhabei, was playing with Lu Xiaopangzi, a nine-year-old boy from a neighboring family, in the lane in front of his house the other day. For some reason, the two children suddenly started fighting, each refusing to give way. As a result, Dalong was defeated and knocked to the ground by Xiaopangzi, immediately losing consciousness and dying. The whole neighborhood was shocked. The post policeman took Lu Xiaopangzi, who caused the incident, to the station for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, the police officer Xu Jinlin was ordered to report to the local court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Inspector Xiao Jin-ying, entrusted by the court, arrived at the scene with a coroner. The autopsy revealed that the deceased Zhu Dalong had suffered a fall on his left temple, which was determined to be the cause of death. The verdict was filled out and given to the family for burial pending instructions.</p>

<p>Mi Qijiang, a 27-year-old day laborer from Taizhou, was unemployed and living in the home of his fellow villager and colleague, Li Hongyu, in Jia Du, Nanshi. Recently, Mi had found a job, so he found other accommodations and did not go to Li's home. Then, Li's wife suddenly disappeared after Mi left Li's house. Li suspected that Mi had abducted her and negotiated with Mi, but to no avail. Suddenly, late at night the other day, he tricked Mi into going to a shed at No. 53, Sanjia Lane, New West District, and, with the help of Mu Xiaobao, Mu Wu-xiao, Mao Guangcai, and others, tied Mi with a rope and poured a large amount of kerosene into Mi's mouth and nose, intending to murder him. Then, they carried Mi Qijiang to the Pudong riverside, threw him into the river, and attempted to destroy the corpse. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by a passerby. Soon after, a nearby police officer heard about it and arrived at the scene. After inquiring about the situation, he ordered the ropes to be untied. Mi Qijiang was able to move his hands and feet, but was already on the verge of death. Mu Xiaobao, Mu Wuxiao, and Mao Guangcai were arrested on the spot. However, when Li Hongyu was arrested, he used a small knife to cut open his head. The police saw this and quickly snatched the knife. He was then taken to the West Gate Precinct and detained after a preliminary hearing. Because the case involved attempted murder, he was ordered to prepare a document and be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation together tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Li Xiaobao and Li Fei's Case of Abuse of Private Punishment Awaits Further Investigation and Retrial <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Yuanqing, from Jiangbei, recently filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the local court, accusing Li Xiaobao, the leader of the North Station Detective Team, and Li Fei, a former detective, of abuse of private punishment and restriction of freedom. Judge Tan Zhuohong once summoned and interrogated them, and the details have been recorded in previous reports. It is learned that this case was continued by Judge Tan yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. On the defendant's side, lawyer Zhan Jifeng appeared in court to defend them. The plaintiff, Zhao Yuanqing, testified first, stating that he was passing by near Hongxing Road when he was taken to the team by Detective Li Fei, who extorted money from him. His father then entrusted his cousin Zhao Yuanshun to send the team leader ten yuan before he was released. Li Fei testified that he was ordered by the team leader to summon Zhao Yuanqing to the team and knew nothing else. Liu Jinrong testified that he saw Zhao Yuanshun hand over five paper dollars and five silver dollars. Finally, Li Xiaobao testified that he did not order Li Fei to summon Zhao Yuanqing. He also claimed that the cause of this case was that Li Fei, Liu Jinrong, and others were dismissed from their duties by order of the team leader, and they held a grudge against him. They secretly discussed at the Andong Hotel to frame him and requested an investigation so that the truth would be revealed. Furthermore, he produced a book of records of arrests, stating that the team must record all arrests. The judge obtained the confession and stated that the circumstances of the case were complex and that a further investigation and summons of witnesses was necessary for a retrial.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Results of Discussion by Telephone Experts: Scope of Investigation Lacks Importance; Extra Communication Fee in Chinese Area Should Be Cancelled to Lighten the Burden; Dual Calls and Call Forwarding for Long Distance Connections Must Be Reformed <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice Press, the issue of telephone price increases in the Shanghai concessions has been under discussion by telephone experts from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan, hired by the Public Works Department, for two months. The report was telegraphed to the Public Works Department for review yesterday. The reporter from the New Voice Press specially sought opinions from relevant parties to serve as research for citizens. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Scope of Investigation Still Lacking in Importance</p>
<p>The Public Works Department first made an agreement with the telephone company that after the automatic installation was completed, it could revise the tariff schedule so that the company could have a net annual interest rate of 8.1%. This was already a fundamental mistake. The scope of investigation given to the experts this time, in short, was only to address whether prices should be increased and by how much. It rarely considered whether the use of telephones by the public was completely convenient and satisfactory under the telephone company's existing system. It is still difficult for the Chinese and foreign public to understand the position of the bureau. Furthermore, the expert report points out that the cost of the telephone company's conversion to automatic machines is enormous, and the ordinary and business expenses are alarming. This is indeed a fact, which shows that the company only knows that raising prices is the only way to increase revenue and does not know that cutting costs can also increase profits.</p>
<p>Toll Calls Should Be Eliminated</p>
<p>What telephone users in this city find most painful is the collection of extra toll calls between the concessions and the city. The report states, "We know of no precedent for users of telephone systems run by two authorities to be able to communicate freely without paying a fee." After investigation by all parties, this is not true. For example, in the case of the two telephone bureaus in Little Luzon, there is no charge for outside calls. Since the expert committee plans to adopt a pay-per-call method, it should advocate the immediate elimination of toll calls in order to save expenses and improve telephone services, which would be fair. Furthermore, direct dialing between the two districts is technically possible and there is absolutely no need to doubt it. However, the committee members have not been able to make practical suggestions on this point from an economic and technical perspective, which is a great regret for the citizens of this city. It is hoped that the telephone company and the telephone bureau authorities will improve the above two points in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Long Distance Connections Should Be Expedited</p>
<p>Long-distance calls made by users of the Shanghai Telephone Company must go through the long-distance stations of both the telephone bureau and the company. This doubles the procedure, which increases waste and costs time. This is rare in other countries around the world. If both authorities can adopt the experts' recommendations and abolish the long-distance station set up by the telephone company, so that the company's users can directly call the long-distance station of the Zhabei branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, efficiency will definitely be improved significantly.</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Chinese Race Club Will Hold Races in Yinxiang Village Today <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Race Club was established in 1926 and was suspended in the summer of last year. After more than a year, Mr. Du Yuesheng presided over the planning and restored all the original organization from before and invited those who loved horse racing to cooperate. As a result, the news that the club would hold races in Yinxiang Port today (the 27th) spread throughout the city again. This time, the club is making a comeback. The layout of the racetrack has many innovations and improvements. The members and the male and female guests in the public stands have very comfortable facilities. The stands have large and small restaurants, and the food and drinks are very rich and delicious. A rest room is specially set up for female guests. The horse ranch is located between the members and the ordinary stands. Before the race, all the famous horses can be seen at a glance. According to the person in charge of the club, those who go to the racetrack can take the Jiangwan Road through the Municipal Government District to Jun Gong Road and turn right, and they will arrive after a little more than a kilometer. The road along the way is flat, and the car ride is very comfortable. The club has a total of eight races today. There are five or six horses that are likely to win in each race, so there are many head-to-head bets and place bets. In addition, the club recently published a racing pictorial, which is dedicated to racing program lists, published every Saturday, and also includes various weekend entertainment and leisure activities, such as horse racing, dog racing, football, sports, movies, dancing, and all kinds of fresh news. Each issue sells for only 20 cents.</p>

<p>Since the China Agricultural Cooperative Loan Syndicate began providing cotton field sales loans in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi in September of this year, it has followed the number allocated by the board of directors to each province and district, and the offices in each district have withdrawn the funds from the branches of the banks participating in the syndicate nearby and transferred them to local sales cooperatives for lending. Because local farmers have received economic assistance, they have actively engaged in cotton field production under the guidance of personnel from the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, the Central Cotton Production Improvement Institute, and the cooperative. The new cotton harvest work has been quite successful. According to the news from the general office of the syndicate, although the cotton fields in the four provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shanxi have been slightly affected by floods, the losses are minimal. After the sales loans were provided, the work of guiding farmers to pack and bale the cotton was carried out very well. It is expected that a large number of new cotton products will be shipped from the place of origin to Shanghai next month for sale to various parties.</p>

Furthermore, it was reported that various pills sold on the market, such as Ningzi Pills, etc., after being tested by the Municipal Hygiene Testing Laboratory, were found to contain morphine and opium acid. Previously, orders were given to investigate and prohibit them. All members must not sell the aforementioned drugs for profit, which would lead to investigation and punishment. Please do not neglect this. This is a notice. (2) Recently, some people have been peddling various counterfeit cigarettes and tax-evading matches to fellow members. The Shanghai Inspection Bureau has discovered several cases daily, with heavy fines imposed. Despite repeated notices from this office, if anyone comes to your door to sell the aforementioned prohibited items, you should refuse to purchase or sell them, to avoid inspection and punishment. How can you not pay attention? There are still many who have been investigated and fined recently. Therefore, we issue this notice again, hoping you will be informed. This is a notice. (3) This association is working to maintain the interests of the industry and strive for uniform market prices to secure the livelihood of businesses. We are currently designing and implementing this. Recently, due to the sharp and unabated increase in foreign prices, after investigating various stores engaged in cutthroat sales, it was found that there was no profit to be made. However, there is still internal competition among members, deliberately selling at low prices or disrupting the industry with overt price-cutting, potentially leading to disputes. If this continues, it will not be in the best interests of the industry. We are now reconvening to reassess and determine prices. Once printed, we will dispatch personnel to deliver them. We hope you will be informed and comply, and refrain from disrupting the market again. Otherwise, you may be subject to sanctions and penalties. This is an urgent notice.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Notice from the Special District Rickshaw Pullers Association: Rickshaw Owners Must Report the Numbers of Their Pullers <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Pullers Association previously registered 40,000 pullers. Recently, most of them have returned to their hometowns, resulting in rickshaw companies being unable to rent out all their vehicles. Therefore, they requested that the Municipal Council conduct a supplementary registration. The association agreed to first accurately report the current number of pullers before verification. The association specifically issued a notice to rickshaw owners, stating: Another notice has arrived! It is from this office, regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers. We have issued numerous notices and sent repeated letters. You rickshaw owners have always ignored them. Now, the deadline set by the Municipal Council is approaching again. Only half of you have submitted the registration numbers of your pullers. This clearly shows that you rickshaw owners are too irresponsible and do not understand what business is about. You do not even understand your own interests, the consequences of your actions, or what is at stake. How can things be done this way? This office, as the representative of the rickshaw companies, has no choice but to bear the humiliation and make a final appeal. Regardless of whether you are short of pullers or not, all rickshaw owners, both big and small, must clearly and in detail provide the names of all your current pullers and their registration numbers to this office. We will then sort things out and submit them to the Municipal Council for record-keeping and future reference. From now on, the pullers registered under your name are yours, and the pullers registered under my name are mine. Limiting the random movement of pullers is a lifeline for us rickshaw companies. We must not let it go and must not delay. Time is running out! Hurry, hurry! If there is anything you do not understand, come to this office immediately and ask for detailed clarification. If you still do not copy down the numbers of your pullers, what basis will you have to speak to the Municipal Council in the future if you are short of pullers? Are you not seeking your own doom? This association will also be helpless. I urge you a thousand times!</p>

<p>A Brief History of the Church</p>
<p>The founder of the Methodist Episcopal Church was the Englishman John Wesley. In 1784, the General Conference of the American Methodist Episcopal Church was formally organized in the United States and spread its teachings to various countries around the world. In 1848, two missionaries came to China and organized the Chinese Methodist Episcopal Church, raising funds to establish schools and hospitals. The country is divided into seven dioceses, with annual conferences held each year. The first conference was held in the 12th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. The meeting place was also in Shanghai. At that time, there were only two major dioceses: Shanghai and Suzhou. This year marks the 50th anniversary, and a grand conference is being held at the Moore Memorial Church in this city.</p>
<p>The Arrival of the Bishop</p>
<p>The conference is scheduled to last six days, from the 30th of this month to November 4th. Representatives from various regions have been arriving one after another. The conference will be presided over by Bishop Arthur J. Moore of the American General Conference. Bishop Moore arrived in Shanghai on the Empress of Japan ship on the 25th. Also arriving were Dr. W. F. Quillian, Director of the Department of Education of the General Conference, and Dr. W. G. Grma, Director of the Department of Evangelism. They are staying at No. 10 Jinglin Residence, Kunshan Road, Hongkou. It is also reported that Dr. Quillian took a train to Beijing yesterday afternoon, and Dr. Grma also traveled to Korea yesterday to inspect local church affairs on behalf of Bishop Moore. They will return to Shanghai before the 30th to attend the conference.</p>

<p>The Xu clan of Zhenjiang has always been a prominent family. They have built a grand ancestral hall in their hometown of Yaoshi Temple. Every spring and autumn, they must remember their ancestors and hold grand ceremonies. However, many members reside in Shanghai due to their careers and cannot go to their hometown. Therefore, the Zhenjiang Xu Clan Shanghai Association was organized. Four times a year, they hold dinners in the West Hall of the Great China Hotel and perform sacrificial rites for the ancestors in the city where the guests are present. This summer, due to the hot weather, they did not have a suitable opportunity, which caused the dinner to be delayed. Now it is autumn, and Qi Yu, who is in charge of the Zi class, has left Shanghai and has not yet returned. But as winter is approaching, it is difficult to delay any further. It is said that they have consulted and agreed to hold the summer and autumn dinners today (the 27th) at 12 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner Zhang Zhiren Sued by Concubine for Abandonment <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiren, a 45-year-old native of Songjiang and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine residing at No. 86 Xiaoyou Lane, Bei Dang Road, French Concession, previously married a Cantonese woman, Ms. Li, as his concubine. Ms. Li is 24 years old. They lived together for nine years and had a son and a daughter, but the child passed away. Last year, Zhang took another concubine, and after she gave birth to a son, Zhang's feelings for Ms. Li gradually cooled, showing a tendency to favor the new and厭弃 the old. He disregarded her livelihood. Furthermore, after taking the new concubine, Zhang falsely claimed to Ms. Li that he needed money to buy land in the countryside and asked her to temporarily hand over her jewelry for his use, promising to return it later. Ms. Li believed him and handed over the jewelry to Zhang. However, Zhang immediately gave it to his new concubine to wear. When Ms. Li found out, she argued with Zhang, and he assaulted her. On the 29th of last month, at around 6 a.m., the two quarreled again over a trivial matter. Zhang used an iron ruler to beat Ms. Li, causing injuries, and then confined her in the room, not allowing her to go out. On the 6th of this month, Ms. Li took advantage of Zhang's absence to see patients and escaped in the evening to her relatives' house. The next day, she asked a fortune teller to write a petition on her behalf and submitted it to the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court, requesting a medical examination. She also filed a private prosecution against Zhang Zhiren in the criminal court for assault, with an attached civil suit seeking monthly living expenses of 50 yuan and medical expenses. She requested that the court investigate the matter according to the law. Upon receiving the petition, the court, yesterday morning, had Judge Qiu Huanjing preside over the trial in the Second Criminal Court and summoned both parties to appear in court. First, the plaintiff, Ms. Zhang Li, described the circumstances of the assault and abuse. The defendant denied the assault, stating that the plaintiff often went out and did not return when he was ill. He advised her, but not only did she not listen, but she also took the opportunity to run away without a trace. He had already reported this to the police. He now requested the court to allow the plaintiff to be taken back by a civilian. The judge told the defendant that the court's forensic doctor had confirmed that the plaintiff had injuries. If she did not want to go back, he could not force her. It would be better to settle the dispute amicably. He also stated that if a settlement could not be reached, the hearing would be rescheduled for 9 a.m. on November 4th, and then adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Nephew Commits Violence; Who Is Behind It?</p>
<p>Wang Xin, a resident of the Fahua Town in Western Shanghai, has a wife and children. Recently, he became involved with a young woman from Qibao, surnamed Mou, and rented a place for her at No. 27 Haige Lane, Haige Road. In order to please her, Wang arranged a banquet at the Great Shanghai Restaurant in the town yesterday (the 26th) to announce that he would officially cohabit with her. Unexpectedly, a tragedy occurred. The night before last, at around 6 p.m., Wang was lured to the door of his house by someone claiming to have something to discuss. Without asking any questions, the person took out an ax and hacked at Wang twice, once on the left shoulder and once on the back, causing deep wounds. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the assailant abandoned the ax and fled. Fortunately, Wang was able to return home with assistance. After examining the wounds, it was determined that they were not life-threatening, and he went to the hospital for treatment. According to some, the assailant was Wang's nephew (the nephew of his brother). Wang often provided financial assistance to the nephew. It is suspected that he was instigated by someone to commit this act. However, Wang's family members are keeping silent about the matter, so the cause is unknown.</p>

The day before yesterday, Zhang's cousin, Tang Lisheng, ran into Ms. Yang on the road with a woman coming out of a movie theater. Upon greeting her, he learned that Ms. Yang was being hidden by Ai Chen, a local woman residing at No. 15 Ai's House on Zhongshan Road. Ai had also introduced her to Xia Caigou, a Chongming native who sells soybeans (Xia is 36 years old and lives in Ai's woodshed). Tang immediately informed Zhang Jiudi, and they went together to pick her up. However, Ai Chen came out and stopped them, demanding 50 yuan for food expenses. Zhang replied that he had no money on him and would send it later, but Ai refused. Ai then gathered many gangsters, dragged Zhang into a small teahouse to negotiate. When they disagreed, they started assaulting him, causing serious injuries to Zhang's chest. Tang Lisheng reported this to Police Sergeant He Hanchen of the Triangle Land Police Station. Upon receiving the report, He immediately led police officers to the scene. The perpetrators had already scattered and fled.

<h3 id="e154">Yesterday's Disaster Relief Soccer Game: Hong Kong Loses to Portugal 2-4; Hong Kong Suffers in the First Half, Conceding Four Goals; Makes Effort to Counterattack in the Second Half, Regaining Two Goals <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>In order to appeal for the disaster victims in various regions, the Flood Relief Association invited the Hong Kong team, the champion of this year's National Games soccer tournament, and the well-known Portuguese soccer team in this city to hold a charity match at the City Center Stadium at 3:00 PM yesterday. Two to three thousand people attended. The Hong Kong team carried the remaining power of the National Games, while the Portuguese had many veterans of sand court matches. The strengths of both sides were originally quite substantial, but it was a pity that Hong Kong was missing Li Huitang, a forward, no different from a headless snake; and the defense was missing Bao Jiaping, which was the same as giving others an opportunity. The Portuguese team attacked from the north to the south, and the nomads rode their horses from the north. They had already gained the advantage of the weather. The Hong Kong team was tired from continuous battles and like a heap of loose sand without harmony among the people. Thus, the Hong Kong team ended the first half with a score of zero to four. Fortunately, in the second half, everyone embraced a do-or-die spirit and constantly planned to wipe out their shame. They broke the cauldrons and sank the boats, working together harmoniously. The battle situation immediately became magnificent, and the overall situation gradually became clearer. They were able to regain one goal. However, the opportunity did not come again, and they eventually suffered a setback with a score of two to four.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Army's Ferocious Onslaught</p>
<p>After the start of the battle, the Portuguese, with the help of the fierce northeast wind, had a very strong morale. One could see the white-clothed men with the cross emblem jumping and chasing deer in the Central Plains. The blue-clothed, white-lettered athletes of Xiangdao (Hong Kong) suddenly had a situation of being unable to attend to both ends. They only held a chaotic battle situation and had no ability to resist. Thus, the enemy's left inside forward, L. Rocha Liao, scored a goal, opening the record. After the Portuguese gained the first goal, their spirit was further boosted. The ball often hovered in the Hong Kong team's position. Soon, the Portuguese center defender, Kao Qitan, took a long shot, which was intercepted by the left winger, Ada Ye, who penetrated along the side and kicked it hard. The Hong Kong goalkeeper, Huang Huaji, did not dare to neglect and quickly pounced to save, but he slipped and lost control, allowing the Portuguese center forward, Ke Lasha, to take advantage of the opportunity and push the ball into the net. Continuing the battle, the Portuguese army became even more arrogant. The right inside forward, Luo Tuo, picked up the ball and sent it to the front of the Hong Kong team's goal. The right inside forward, Liang Xianzhan, originally intended to head the ball out of bounds, but unexpectedly committed suicide, causing the ball to rush into the net, resulting in a score of three to zero. After this, although the Hong Kong team launched a counterattack once, it failed and was instead captured by the Portuguese team, with Ke Lasha scoring another goal, ending the first half with a score of four to zero.</p>
<p>Counterattack Yielded Little Effect</p>
<p>After Hong Kong and Portugal switched sides and fought again, the Hong Kong army was filled with righteous indignation, and the forwards were very active. Moreover, with the help of the wind, they were like tigers with wings. Zheng Jiliang entered and exited the million-strong army as if he were in no man's land. In a few minutes, the Portuguese team's virginity was broken by a Hong Kong team forward with a "zigzag" pass, headed by Zheng Jiliang, clear and crisp like never before, making it four to one. After this, although there were many good opportunities, there were also frequent misses. Ten minutes later, Cao Guicheng attacked the enemy's right wing position, and the center forwards also lined up in a goose formation to echo remotely. Cao dribbled to a suitable point and then hit the road to the center, and the Portuguese city was broken again. After that, the Hong Kong team was aggressive, and Tan Jiangbai was transferred to center forward, making the momentum even stronger. The Portuguese army's morale was slightly reduced. Unfortunately, the time had expired, and the counterattack ultimately failed, finishing the game with a score of two to four. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team</p>

<p>The Western Soccer League has begun for two weeks. The Chinese A-League teams have been postponed due to the National Games. Today, Donghua will play against English Ness at 3:00 PM at Shenyuan for their debut match this season. Donghua was last season's champion. Although Lu Zhongen, Chen Jiaqiu, and Wan Xianghua cannot play due to circumstances, they have recruited famous players Sun Jinshun and Xu Ting to join the team to supplement them. Cao Lin has also recovered to his original state. The strength is even more icing on the cake. As for the British army, they are known for their tenacity.

<p>Yesterday, Central Abandons, Guanghua Defeats Chi Zhi 3-2</p>
<p>Fudan Wins Over Jinan, Championship Hopes are Quite High</p>
<p>The 9th Jiangnan Eight University Tennis Championships opened yesterday afternoon at Guanghua University on Daxi Road. This year's participants include five schools: Central, Guanghua, Chi Zhi, Jinan, and Fudan. Last year's champion, Jinling, did not participate due to circumstances. In yesterday's matches, Guanghua originally met Central, and Chi Zhi had a bye. Unexpectedly, Central was absent at the last minute, so Guanghua directly competed with Chi Zhi yesterday. As a result, Guanghua relied on the victory of the final doubles match to eliminate Chi Zhi 3-2 and win the final rights. Fudan then won a singles match and overwhelmed Jinan, also winning the final rights. According to the rules, the doubles match no longer needs to be played, but both sides continued to hold it to show sportsmanship. Fudan won both doubles matches again, resulting in a score of 5-0. Guanghua and Chi Zhi have equal skills and strength. Both sides are good at blocking the net and have excellent performances. However, Chi Zhi committed too many suicides, which was the main reason for the failure. As for the battle between Fudan and Jinan, both singles and doubles formed a one-sided situation. Fudan has many talents this year, such as Sun Qifang, Huang Jinju, Xu Zengrui, Peng Shaoxue, Feng Yipei, Guo Shaokai, and Huang Andao, who are all veterans of the sand court in the Xianfang Cup. No wonder Jinan returned in defeat. The second match between Guanghua and Chi Zhi, which was originally scheduled for 9:00 AM today, has been canceled because Central abandoned yesterday and Guanghua has already won the final rights. The final between Fudan and Guanghua will start at 2:00 PM this afternoon and will still be held at the Guanghua Stadium. Fudan has the highest hopes for winning this championship. The results are as follows:</p>

<p>"Are you willing to compete with me?" Nanen said, eager to show off her skills.</p>
<p>Tao Mo leaned against the wall, looking very tired, and said, "It's too hot."</p>
<p>Nanen's sharp eyes glanced from one face to another. Seeing that Taifei was frowning, she asked, "What's wrong, Taifei?"</p>
<p>Jieke replied with a contemptuous expression, "The ball hurt his hand; he cries out at everything."</p>
<p>"I don't, I never do, no matter how much pain I suffer; crying out is just like a little Shi Bao," Nanen said, with a kind of haughty air.</p>
<p>"Taifei was provoked by that criticism and replied: Pshaw, I can make you cry in two minutes."</p>
<p>"See if you can!"</p>
<p>Taifei pointed to a tree with hard thorns by the wall and said, "Then go pick a thorn from that."</p>
<p>Nanen immediately "pinched the handful of thorns," pulled it out, and still held it in her hand with an "I'm not afraid of anything" air, even though the severe pain was almost unbearable.</p>
<p>"You're really amazing," the children shouted in unison. They naturally changed their attitude when they saw that a girl could have such courage.</p>

<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Reading is divided into rote learning and active learning. What is rote learning? What is active learning? Let me explain slowly.</p>
<p>We usually study at school, listening to teachers in class and discussing with classmates after class. All of this is knowledge gained from books. We should sincerely accept the knowledge in books because there are many things in books that we cannot see or hear in our daily lives. Reading books will help us know them. However, to gain broad knowledge, we must search in this great environment. Knowledge gained from books will only help us know but not thoroughly understand, so doubts often remain in our minds. Studying books exclusively without experimenting is rote learning. So how do we learn actively? We should research and investigate all phenomena in our daily lives according to what is said in books, and see if the experiments are the same as what is said in the books. Knowledge gained from such experiments can be deeply imprinted in our minds and will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>All inventors have invented various things through research and experimentation. They not only win glory for their country, but people all over the world benefit from them.</p>
<p>Children! Do you want to be inventors? Then you should work hard at studying and strive to research during this precious childhood. If you can invent things in the future, you will not only benefit society but also win glory for the Republic of China. At that time, you will think of the benefits of active learning.</p>

<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>Xiao Sizi is a poor child. His father is a worker who sells his labor, and his mother is a poor woman who helps others with work. Living in such a poor family, he naturally has no right to study. But Xiao Sizi loves to study very much. Although he has no money to go to school, he always feels envious when he sees children carrying schoolbags to school on the street.</p>
<p>But this autumn, the small school across the street from his home suddenly opened a literacy school. Unexpectedly, Xiao Sizi was forced to go to the literacy school to study, despite his father's strong disapproval. Studying was exactly what Xiao Sizi wanted, so he went to school in a hurry on the first day of school.</p>
<p>Although Xiao Sizi is only eight years old, because he is eager to learn, he studies literacy very seriously, so his grades are the best in the class of fifty people. Many old men and women in their fifties and sixties scored behind him. This made Xiao Sizi so happy that he woke up laughing from his dreams.</p>
<p>Because Xiao Sizi now knows hundreds of characters and has learned some rules at school, he is not as wild as he was when he was not studying. He knows how to bow when he sees people and speaks politely. Although the clothes on his body are still so old and worn, he washes them himself every two or three days, so he is not as annoying as before. So, a neighbor, Mr. prepared to introduce him to a shop to learn a trade.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met him and asked him what he had been doing these days. He said: "These days, I am preparing a story about the Xinhai Revolution. I am preparing to go on stage to give a speech. Although my speech is less than ten minutes long, the teacher said that I spoke very well when I practiced yesterday. Sir, would you be interested in hearing my speech that day?"</p>
<p>Xiao Sizi was originally a wild child, but after studying for two months, he completely changed. He knows etiquette, can give speeches, can read vernacular essays, and will become an apprentice in a shop. Although his background is very poor, I think this is a very good model for children.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Knowledge of Tears <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>How do tears come about? This is a little knowledge that we should understand. When we are sad, tears flow out unconsciously, and tears also flow out when we are extremely happy. In other words, tears flow out when we are mentally stimulated or when the mucous membrane of the eyes and nose is stimulated. But what kind of thing are tears? Now I will tell you the physiological reason. Each of our two eyes has two lacrimal glands, and these lacrimal glands are the place where tears are produced. The amount of production varies with the seasons. The amount of production is not much in spring and autumn, and the amount of production is the most in extremely cold and hot weather. Tears are secreted from these four lacrimal glands. Tears have a great effect on the eyeballs. They can prevent the two eyeballs from drying out, keep the eyeballs fairly moist, and smooth the movement of the eyeballs. If the production of tears stops temporarily, the eyeballs will lose their freedom of movement, and the eyes will not be able to turn up, down, left, or right. Moreover, the eyeballs will also rupture. When dust and small organisms fly into the eyes, the eyes feel very uncomfortable, and the eyelids will move and tears will flow out, completely washing the eyeballs and letting the dust flow out of the corners of the eyes with the tears, and the eyeballs will not be damaged. Therefore, tears have a great effect. The lacrimal glands are near the inner canthus, passing through the lacrimal duct and flowing into the nasal cavity to become nasal mucus. If we feel very unhappy, we often cry and tears flow together, because being unhappy stimulates the "sympathetic nerve," the blood vessels immediately expand, and the surrounding muscles suddenly contract, compressing the lacrimal glands, and tears flow out continuously. As for the composition of tears, they contain one percent salt, as well as protein, carbonic acid soda, etc., so when tears flow into the mouth, they feel salty. You should never drop tears into food when you are eating, because it is extremely unsanitary.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Capturing Monkeys <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Kangjianzhaifu</p>
<p>Humans are considered the most intelligent beings in the world, but while monkeys are not as clever, they love to imitate. Humans take advantage of this imitative nature to catch them.</p>
<p>Legend has it that in the past, many wild monkeys inhabited Hengshan and Jianshan in Nantong. Living in the mountains and forests, they were originally harmless and caused no offense to humans. At the foot of the mountain, there was a teacher who gathered students and taught. The monkeys, seeing this from afar in the forest, waited until school was dismissed in the evening, then sneaked into the school. The larger monkeys dressed up as the teacher, and the smaller ones pretended to be students, messing with the books, brushes, and ink. By the time people arrived the next day, they had already vanished. At first, the teacher didn't understand and thought it was just naughty students causing trouble. Several of the more vocal students were repeatedly wrongly punished.</p>
<p>But despite the punishments, the mischief continued. The teacher grew increasingly suspicious and decided to investigate secretly. He discovered that it was indeed a group of monkeys doing this. After seeing this, the teacher came up with a plan. He cut out many small red paper circles and ordered the students to stick them on their eyes, pretending to play hide-and-seek. He also instructed the students to wear wooden clogs meant for rainy days to school, but to leave the clogs in the school when they went home.</p>
<p>The teacher left many red paper plasters on the desk and prepared a few villagers to lie in ambush with weapons. Sure enough, after class was dismissed, the monkeys sneaked into the school one by one, imitating the students by wearing the wooden clogs and sticking the red paper circles on their eyes. They were having a great time when suddenly, shouts arose from all sides, and the villagers came forward with weapons. The monkeys, with their eyes covered by the plasters and wearing wooden clogs, ran around blindly, and were captured one by one. This was considered revenge for the wrongly punished students.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Abacus and Knot-Tying <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>"In ancient times, government was conducted by tying knots." Big events were recorded with large knots, and small events with small knots, to aid memory where it fell short. Different colored ropes were used to record different kinds of events. This has already been roughly described in the article "The Story of Knot-Tying" (published in this journal on September 29th). However, human wisdom is constantly developing, never stopping. Things once considered very convenient are often later found to be less applicable. Knot-tying is one such example.</p>
<p>As knot-tying became less practical, clever people came up with ways to improve upon it. According to Western scholars, the abacus we use today evolved from knot-tying. The abacus has rows of bamboo rods with beads strung on them. Originally, these rods were ropes, and the beads were the knots. This method of aiding memory is naturally much more convenient and applicable than knot-tying, and people gladly adopted it.</p>
<p>So, what did the earliest abacuses for recording information look like? This is difficult to determine. They were probably very crude, perhaps simply twigs bent into beads with a few ropes tied on them, nothing as refined as the abacuses we have today. The ones we use now have nine, eleven, or thirteen rows. Each row has seven beads. The top two beads are separated by a horizontal bar. Below the horizontal bar, each of the five beads counts as one. This later development came about because as human affairs became more complex, people's wisdom increased, leading them to invent this ingenious tool for counting. From then on, it was used for counting and no longer for recording information. This is a segment of the evolution from knot-tying to using the abacus, and it is a natural evolution.</p>

<p>—Broken Light Bulbs Can Be Made into Fish Tanks—</p>
<p>This idea was mentioned in an article in this newspaper before, but the method of making it was not clearly explained. After reading the article, I was struck by a mischievous idea. One evening, with nothing to do, I found a few broken light bulbs and started experimenting. I broke two in a row and was quite surprised! I kept trying with renewed vigor, and calmly used my brain, and finally succeeded in my experiment. I dare not keep this secret to myself, so I wrote this article to share with my dear little friends. When you have nothing to do, you might as well try it!</p>

<p>(2) Tools—A knife, an awl, a small pair of scissors, and a basin of clear water.</p>
<p>(3) Instructions—First, use the knife to carefully cut off the lacquered cap at the top of the bulb. Then, fill the copper ring with water, hold the bulb firmly with one hand, place it in the basin of water, and use the awl to firmly strike the center of the bulb's core, causing the filament to break off. (Be careful not to let the bulb touch the bottom of the basin when striking). Then, use the scissors to cut away the glass connecting to the filament inside the water, cutting close to the copper ring to create a round hole. At this point, remove the filament from the bulb. Use thread to secure it tightly to the copper nails on both sides of the copper ring. Put some water in the bulb and raise one or two small goldfish. Isn't it a very fun fish tank?</p>
<p>Note—When striking the filament with the awl, the copper ring must be filled with water, because the light bulb is not truly empty. The water on top will reduce the external air pressure, and the bulb will not break.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Why Be Punctual? <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>"Being unpunctual" is an old habit of us Chinese people, so naturally, Chinese children are no exception. Dear little friends, do you want to be "unpunctual" children? If not, start being punctual from today onward—the reason why Chinese people are unpunctual is that they did not develop the habit of "being punctual" in their childhoods. Therefore, children! You must pay absolute attention to this issue of "being punctual"!</p>
<p>Why be punctual? It's because time does not return. Mr. Zhu Ziqing said it very well: "When the leaves wither, they have a time to turn green again; when the swallows leave, they have a time to return; when time goes, does it have a time to come back? Smart one, tell me, is there a time to come back?" Although I am not smart, I dare to say that time does not return.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of being punctual?</p>
<p>First, it doesn't waste time. For example, if we are taking a bus that leaves at 2:00, if you arrive at the station at 2:15, the bus will have left, and you will have to wait for the next one. Wouldn't you have wasted a lot of time in between? If you are punctual, this won't happen, isn't that the advantage of "being punctual"?</p>
<p>Second, it doesn't delay things. If you are not punctual and miss the bus, you won't be able to reach your destination, and the work you need to do will be delayed. If it's something important, something that affects the bigger picture, wouldn't it delay many people's affairs? If you are punctual, this won't happen, isn't that the advantage of "being punctual"?</p>
<p>Third, it maintains order. For example, if a meeting is scheduled for 9:00 AM at a certain place, but some members arrive at 8:30 AM, and others arrive at 9:30 AM, wouldn't that make the meeting place chaotic? How can there be order? If you are punctual, this won't happen, isn't that the advantage of "being punctual"?</p>
<p>Fourth, it increases efficiency. Because if you are not punctual, the work you do will definitely not be more than other people's. If a punctual person does two things, you can only do one thing. If you are punctual, this won't happen, isn't that the advantage of "being punctual"?</p>
<p>In summary, we know that if we are punctual, we can save time, not delay things, maintain order, and increase efficiency. Children! I hope you will always be punctual!</p>

<p>— Xi</p>
<p>I quickly asked, "Madam, may I ask where these things are?" The magpie replied, "In my Green Palace, my love, you can see how we live there. There are over a hundred of us in total, and we are not like the large magpies in the villages, who often beg on the roads. We are all of noble lineage, slender and lively, none as big as a fist. Our bodies always have no more and no less than seven black stripes and five white stripes, this is an unchangeable rule, and we look down on all other races. You indeed do not have black stripes, but your quality is Russian, which is enough to let you enter the door of the Green Palace. We live our lives by doing two things: chatting and grooming. We groom from morning to noon, and chat from noon to dusk. We each perch on a tree, the taller the better, and the more ancient the more wonderful. In the middle of the forest stands an extremely large and fine elm tree, unfortunately, no one lives there. It is the former residence of the tenth generation of Queen Magpie (i.e., magpie). We often go there on pilgrimages, sighing and lamenting; but although we carry a light melancholy of nostalgia, our time is spent extraordinarily happily. All the wives there are very virtuous, and the husbands are not jealous. Our happiness is pure and real, because our hearts are very open, just like our speech, which is very straightforward. Our personalities are all very proud. If a hooded crow or other lowly species intrudes among us, we will all rise up together and peck at him mercilessly, but we also treat good neighbors very favorably. Therefore, we often prepare to help the sparrows and goldfinches who live in our small forest, sharing food with them and helping them resist external enemies. There is no place in the world where you can find a race as talkative as us, and none that speaks as well. In short, we live in happiness, nobility, conversation, and grooming."</p>
<p>I replied, "Madam, this is indeed the best there could be. I would not disobey any command you issue, but before I follow you, please allow me to say a word to this good girl." Then, I turned to the dove and said, "I beg you to tell me truthfully, do you really think I am a Russian magpie?"</p>

<h3 id="e178">Finance: Gold Speculation Closes at an Astounding High of $1148; Exchange Imposes Special Certificates on Buyers, Resulting in a Sharp Drop of Over $40 After Closing <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The gold market remained volatile yesterday, with prices fluctuating rapidly. Although the decline was briefly reversed due to central bank intervention, the bears aggressively covered their positions, and a large number of speculators from Shenfeng came in to put pressure on the market. The closing price surged to an astounding new high of $1148. Unexpectedly, fortunes changed dramatically and unpredictably. Zhongfeng re-emerged, triggering a sudden sell-off in the five minutes after closing, causing a sharp drop of over $40, a truly regrettable event. The exchange has announced the imposition of a special certificate fee of $50 per lot on buyers, a significant blow to the bulls. This may curb the bulls' arbitrary manipulation and trampling of the bears, indirectly stabilizing public sentiment to some extent. Currently, the speculative price is over $130 higher than the settlement price, while the arbitrage price for US dollars is $40-50 lower than the forward speculative price. This kind of distorted abnormality is unprecedented, and the speculators' power seems to have surpassed that of ordinary investors, which is understandable from a rational perspective. Initially, with flat silver prices in London and New York, the forward silver price in Montevideo fell by 2.5 to 5.5%, exchange rates slightly narrowed, and the spot gold price in London rose by 3 pence, causing anxiety and uncertainty in the market. There was a sense of not knowing where to start. Major players such as Shenfeng, Fuxing, and Yongji immediately began buying, and off-exchange pre-market trading gradually pushed prices up to $1140. Hengyu, Chunyuan, Yonghuixiang, and Dada took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling back to $25-26. Dalian Du and Shenfeng Hengchang Yong then advanced to $32-33. Hengyu and Dadecheng sold again at $25-26. Yongli, Shenfeng, Lichang, and Shanghong managed to hold on. The central bank announced its exchange rates, with reduced supply of British and American currency, and the customs gold unit rose by 4.8%, raising the standard speculative gold price to $1011.5. This seemed to have no impact on sentiment, and prices rose by over $30 after opening. The central bank intervened by selling shillings, and foreign banks and Sassoon also sold, hardening the foreign exchange market and triggering a sudden wave of selling. After the major bearish players sold, rumors spread that they were selling physical gold certificates, greatly calming the market and breaking through the $20 and $10 levels, once falling to $1103. The bears covered their short positions at the lower prices, and the bulls continued to add to their positions, gradually rebounding. However, due to flat exchange rates quoted by HSBC in London and New York, and a loosening foreign exchange market, there were repeated declines along the way. However, due to the tense situation on the trading floor, a large number of speculators repeatedly manipulated the market, leading to a sideways trend. Later, banks took advantage of the lower prices to cover their positions slightly, and the efforts of Huashang Bank, Zhejiang, and Jiaotong to aggressively buy contracts stirred market sentiment. Although the foreign exchange market did not tighten, the gold market regained its bullishness. Finally, although the predicted decrease in Indian silver was only one anna, the general bearish players were again in dire straits, breaking through the $40 level, and the closing price rose to a high of $1148. After the close, due to Zhongfeng's re-emergence with a large number of contracts, the bears eagerly liquidated, resulting in a drop to within $1110. The volatility was evident to all in the industry. In the end, it remained above $20. The forward spread was posted at $17 by the bulls yesterday, and the spot market trend weakened daily.</p>
<p>The opening price this morning was $1126.5, a rise of $27.5 from the previous closing price. Wanxing and Huixiang Dada came in to buy, rising to $31. Hengchang Yong Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Fuyu Yingxiang sold, falling to $22. Fuxing Yong Shenfeng Yongli Chunyuan Yong took advantage of the low prices to buy, rising to $6.5. The central bank released 625 November shillings, and Sassoon sold 750,000 in the same month. Fuxing Yong Hengyu Wanfeng Wanxing Dadecheng Tongfeng Hengtongyi competed to sell, and the decline began immediately, breaking through the two major levels of $20 and $10, falling to $03. Huixiang Hengyu Chunyuan Yong Dadecheng Yongli took advantage of the low prices to buy, rising to $16. The central bank sold an additional 937,500 November shillings, Fuxing Yong Dadecheng Wanxing Wanfeng Huixiang Fuyu competed to sell, and it fell back to $07. Lichang Hengchang Yong Yongli Fuxing Yong then bought, rising to $14.5. Dada Huixiang Fushun Hengyu still sold at $10. Shenfeng Fuxing Yong Chunyuan Yong Huixiang Fuyu Yingxiang took advantage of the low prices to buy, rising to $17. Knowing that HSBC quoted flat British and American exchange rates, China and others sold 625,000 December US dollars, falling to $1.5. Shenfeng Fuxing Yong Chunyuan Yong Huixiang Ma Yu Yingxiang jointly bought, gradually rising to $18. Fuxing Yong Fuyu Dadecheng Wanxing Yuanmaoyong Huixiang still sold at $5. Dadecheng Fuxing Yong Qingfayong Fengchang Yongli Yuanmaoyong jointly bought, rising to $21. Yuxinxiang Dadecheng Yicheng Dingkang competed to sell, and it fell back to $14.5. Yuanmaoyong and others maintained the low prices, rising to $9. Yuqingyong Dingkang Qingfayong still sold, falling back to $5.5. Yuanmaoyong Dadecheng Hengyu Richang Chunyuan Yong Lichang Huixiang Wanfeng Shenfeng Yiyu competed to buy, gradually rising to $36. Fuyu Wanxing Fuxing Yong Hengchang Yong Dadecheng Yingxiang Dada took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling to $21. Lichang Fuxing Yong Hengyu came in to buy, rising to $6.5. Yingxiang Yicheng supplied, falling back to $1.5. Futaiyong Hengyu bought, rising again to $7.5. Dadecheng Futaiheng sold, falling to $3.5. Hengyu Yifeng Yong Jiatai Dadecheng Yuanmaoyong Fuyu Chunyuan Yong rushed to buy, rebounding to $33.5. Dafayong Yong Cha Lichang sold, falling to $0.05. Yongli Lichang Yuanmaoyong Hanheng came in to buy, rising to $7. Shenfeng Huixiang Dafayong took advantage of the high prices to supply, falling back to $3.5. Dadecheng Tongyi Yingfeng Hengyong Dehou Yuyongli Huixiang Hengyu came in to buy, and with the prediction of a small decrease in Indian silver, it rose to $46. Fuxing Yong Huixiang Yuanyi Yicheng took advantage of the high prices to sell at $2.5. Huixiang Hengyu Fuyu Dadecheng bought again, and it rose to $8. Thereafter, Shenfeng and others bought and sold intermittently, and from $3.5 to $8. The midday close was $1148. After the close, due to Zhongfeng's re-emergence with a large number of contracts, Dada Huixiang Fuxing Yong Lichang Yuanyi Hengyu Dadecheng Yuanheng Qianchangxiang Tongfu rushed to sell, breaking through the four major levels of $40, $30, $20, and $10, falling to $05. The exchange announced the imposition of a special certificate fee of $50 on buyers, which greatly affected the psychology of the bulls. Fuxing Shui Yingxiang Hengyu Fuyu Dada Richang Yongli Chunyuan Yong and others then rose to $25. Yiyu Fuyu sold, falling to within $20. Finally, the exchange officially announced the collection of special certificates from buyers, and the market stabilized, hovering between $21 and $22, with sellers still covering their positions.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the central bank's standard speculative gold price, rose to $1011.5, $136 higher than the closing price, and more than $25 higher than the previous closing price. The registration price for November was $1131, and for December was $1148. The morning swap rate was $1131, and the red gold price was reduced by $10 to $1116.5. The spot market was even weaker, the gold market was high, the supply was even more urgent, and there was a lack of buyers. Tianjin goods were reduced by $10, and refined gold was reduced by $3, both lacking buyers and not being traded. Only local goods were bought by Yingfeng Heng for over 100 taels, reduced by $12. The forward spread was even higher, with Yingfeng Heng offering seven to Shunmao, Hongkang Yong seven, increased to $17.</p>
<p>The trading floor was chaotic. In total, Shenfeng, Wanxing, Zhaofengchang, Chunyuan Yong, Yongli, Yifengshui, Yuxinxiang, Deli, Wanfeng, Lifeng, Yingfeng Heng, Huixiang, etc. were on the buying side. Tongyi Dachangxiang Tongtaichang Tongfeng Heng Yicheng Qianchangxiang Qingfayong Dadecheng Yuanheng Fuxing Yong Shunli, etc. were on the selling side. Shenfeng Yuanyi Dadecheng first bought and then sold, Hengyu Huixiang Yiyu first sold and then bought. The Dalian gang and Wanxing together traded around 1300 lots, netting over 700 contracts. Shunli traded a total of over 1300 lots, netting over 100 contracts. The Guangdong gangs Shengsheng and Daxing had relatively balanced inflows and outflows.</p>
<p>A review of the morning's market situation shows that the prices fluctuated rapidly, with major players such as Shenfeng continuing to add to their positions, putting even more pressure on the bears. The opening price in the morning was $1122.5, and the midday price was $1148. The highest price was $1148, and the lowest was $1103, with a fluctuation of $45. As a result, the closing price rose again by $40 from the previous closing price, but the subsequent decline was also significant. In the morning, Yifeng Yong was the most active buyer, covering over 1100 short positions, Chunyuan Yong covered over 800 short positions, and Yongli and Deli each added over 100 contracts.

<h3 id="e179">Central Bank's Discount Sales Loosen the Forex Market; Swap Rates Further Apart... Tightening Quickly After Initial Loosening <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London rates were generally flat for both near and far terms. The New York silver market remained unchanged. Forward silver prices in Montreal also fell, with interest rates ranging from 5% to 5.5%. London spot gold rose three pence. The pound sterling depreciated by half a cent against the US dollar and fell six pound notes against the French franc. The US dollar depreciated by twenty-five points against the pound and by one hundred and twenty-five points against the franc. The forex market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of one shilling four pence for the pound and $32.75 for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the pound tightened by 0.1875 and the dollar by 0.0375, indicating strong market sentiment. After the Central Bank announced its rates, the pound depreciated by 0.0375 and the dollar by 0.08125. The customs gold unit rose by 4.8%, with little impact. After the opening, the Central Bank aggressively sold off, greatly calming market sentiment. Sassoon and various foreign banks also started selling. The process was quite difficult. Although Chinese merchants took advantage of the lower prices, the market remained loose due to the substantial selling by banks and the Central Bank. It was expected that HSBC would adjust its rates, leaving both the pound and the dollar unchanged. Chinese merchants took advantage of the lower prices to cover their positions, stabilizing the situation. Banks took advantage of the lower prices to replenish slightly, while Chinese banks such as Zhejiang Jiaotong Trade showed a sudden surge in demand, gradually tightening the market. It was predicted that the Indian silver would fall by a small amount (one anna), which would have little impact. However, the psychological impact on Chinese merchants was significant. The gold market saw another sharp rise, while the forex market had few transactions. Banks also showed no intention of buying or selling, leading to market confusion. However, the underlying trend was undoubtedly tightening. Based on transaction prices, the near-term selling prices at the close were approximately one shilling four pence 3125 for the pound and $33.50 for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the pound was 0.0625 looser and the dollar 0.0375 tighter. Swap rates diverged further, with the forward market tightening. Chinese merchants covered approximately £30,000 in pounds and over $200,000 in US dollars. The Central Bank offered pounds, while Jiaotong Bank aggressively covered spot pounds. Here are the midday transactions:</p>
<p>Pound Sterling: The morning opening price for near-term sales was one shilling four pence. The Central Bank sold November contracts to Citibank at one pence 615. Sassoon sold November contracts to Banque Belge at 0.0075. The Central Bank sold November contracts to Banque Belge at 0.009375. Macquarie sold December contracts at 0.005625 and 0.005. British Bank sold December contracts at 0.005. HSBC Mitsui sold spot contracts to Zhejiang at four pence 375. Macquarie sold late October contracts to Jiaotong at 0.00375. HSBC, Macquarie, Chase, Banque Belge, Mitsui, and Citibank sold spot contracts to Jiaotong at the same price. Citibank covered November contracts at three pence 8125. Closing selling prices were one shilling four pence 3125 for spot, 0.01875 for October, three pence 6875 for November, 0.003125 for December, and three pence for January, with the buying price increased by 0.000625.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Market's Plight Reaches Such Extremes <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The prior day saw many long-term contracts, with some being rolled over at the original amounts and others requiring interest payments that were difficult to meet. One major factory had a long-term loan of $300,000, and when closing its books at the end of April in the first half of the year, it had already included $1,500 in interest as principal. The remaining three or four hundred odd dollars were paid on account. For the current period's interest, there was an additional $16,000. The creditor demanded payment of over $30,000, covering the principal and interest from the previous two periods. The debtor wanted to include the interest and principal and requested an additional $17,000 or $18,000 to round the total to $350,000. It was reported that the creditor conceded to payment of the current period's interest, but the debtor still claimed it was currently impossible to raise such a large sum to pay the interest. If the creditor refused to compromise, the debtor would have to accept the consequences. Such situations were reportedly numerous. It was also said that short term loans, both those that were maturing yesterday and those due at the end of the month for which interest payments were being demanded early, amounted to no less than $3 or $4 million. Aside from the principal, which was generally rolled over without issue, the interest alone totaled $140,000 or $150,000. With only three or four days remaining until the end of the month, it is unknown how many more disputes will arise.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Securities and Government Bond Markets Also Affected by Poland <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Gold Speculators Went Long in the First Two Sessions</p>
<p>Gold Shorts Suddenly Rose Sharply and Hit the Limit</p>
<p>Gains Were Sharp, Losses Were Swift, and Closing Prices Suddenly Declined</p>
<p>The Net Increase Was Still Around Two Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, only November futures were traded. Market sentiment was extremely high, and investor confidence seemed to be soaring. However, upon examining the reasons for the rise, there were no concrete facts to support it. If it was due to inflation, it was still far from reality. If it was due to a good environment, there was no genuinely optimistic news. Market rumors suggested that the continued sharp rise in margin calls was the reason. Those who had won big in the margin call market turned to the government bond market, with extremely strong demand. However, the rising trend was too inconsistent with the environment, leading to a sudden and dramatic reversal. Wild speculation has caused great turmoil and the future is full of twists and turns. Although only three sessions were held yesterday, trading was extremely active. Numbers 16, 78, 20, and the northern faction were mostly selling. Number 48 bought after selling, and Number 78 covered small losses. Numbers 14, 35, 22, 54, 47, and 73 were mostly buying. At the opening, prices rose several cents to $1.30. In the second session, the bulls made every effort to push prices higher, and the rising trend resumed. Military Debentures rose sharply by $10.60, and Gold Shorts rose sharply by $4.00, triggering the limit. Gains were sharp and losses were swift, resulting in a sharp drop in closing prices. The largest decline was $1.65. The net increase was still several cents to over two dollars. Number 96 also increased by $0.95. Due to the limit on Gold Shorts, no closing trades were made, so its increase was as high as $1.70. The total transaction volume was approximately $3 million. The results of the price changes are listed in the table below (unit: dollars):</p>
<p>Category | Highest Price | Session | Lowest Price | Session | Change from Previous Day | Volume</p>

<p>The yarn market experienced a sharp rise and fall. Initially, the margin calls soared, shocking the market and creating intense enthusiasm. Buyers flocked in like a tide, and the market advanced steadily. Short sellers lacked the ability to resist and could only reluctantly cut their positions. The market price rose even more sharply, with March futures soaring by $5.50. In the afternoon, rumors of a decline in after-hours margin calls caused a sudden turn for the worse, and the market price continued to fall.</p>
<p>Sudden Rise and Fall of Margin Yarn; In the morning session, margin yarn across all months surged uniformly. There were enthusiastic buyers in the market. Because the gold market rose in a straight line and reached an astonishing high, there was a lack of supply, and the market tightened further and further. The situation was extremely chaotic, with wildly varying price quotes. By the close, the momentum was even stronger, with March futures reaching a high of $188, a jump of $5.50 from the previous day's close. Fortunately, some long positions were taken to take profits, resulting in an increase of $3.70 to $5.50 in all months compared to the previous day's close. The market trend changed drastically after the opening in the afternoon, and the market turned weak. Because after the margin call closing, after-hours trading fell to around $100, there was a lack of buyers for a time, and speculators were eager to close out their positions. The market price suddenly turned downward, falling session after session. As a result, all months fell by $0.90 to $3 compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 4,410 bales, Dafeng 3,950 bales, Yuanda 2,150 bales, Changji 1,000 bales, Ruida 4,005 bales, Renfeng 2,450 bales, Yichang 3,650 bales, Gengfeng 2,900 bales, and Xincheng 2,100 bales.

<p>The cotton market saw rapid gains and losses, with extremely volatile conditions. Initially, margin calls rose, with new peaks appearing one after another, breaking through the $1,100 barrier. Short sellers were fearful, and the market was full of buyers. In the second and third sessions, only buyers were seen, and the market soared. High prices reached $38.50, on par with the high prices seen when the increased import tax was implemented last year. In the afternoon, rumors of a decline in after-hours margin calls caused a major change in the market, and the market price fell step by step, retreating by over a dollar.</p>
<p>Margin Cotton Rises in the Morning, Falls in the Afternoon</p>
<p>In the morning session, the margin cotton market was extremely chaotic, with even more buyers. The situation was serious. Prices across all months rose sharply, and the rising trend was unstoppable. At the second session, it was heard that gold prices had reached a peak of over $1,150, causing market volatility. The market was firm, and price quotes were wildly inconsistent. Although large long positions were being taken, it was still difficult to suppress the enthusiasm. The high for the third session reached $38.50, resulting in an increase of $0.95 to $1.30 across all months compared to the closing price on the 10th. At the close, it was rumored that margin calls had declined, causing a sudden drop of one cent. After the afternoon opening, the market changed drastically due to the gold market, and selling pressure increased again. The market price fell session after session, and the decline was quite severe. As a result, all months fell by $0.90 to $1.30 compared to the morning closing price, except for March futures, which fell by 0.6.

<p>Yarn up $8... Cotton up $3; Recently, the yarn and cotton markets have been driven by the gold market frenzy, rising sharply day after day, like runaway horses. In order to maintain stability, the Yarn and Cotton Exchange authorities will, starting Monday, October 28, increase the special margin requirement for new yarn purchases by $8 per bale and for new cotton purchases by $3 per dan. Both sides of the transaction will be charged on their inventory.</p>
<h3 id="e185">U.S. Cotton Softens Due to Hedge Selling <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>British and Indian Cotton Markets Are Also Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with the October contract up seven points and the remaining months down two points. 1,400 delivery notices were received by dealers. The October contract rose due to short covering, while the remaining months softened due to hedge selling, profit-taking, and favorable weather. Later, dealers bought back the hedged amounts and rolled the December contract to further months, causing the market to recover slightly. It is generally believed that the October 1936 contract will be equal to or lower than the July contract. Southern mills need to be active. Textile demand is calm. Haughty estimated that mill consumption this week would be 392,000 bales, and Liverpool stocks would be 150,000 bales. The closing was stable. Spot prices fell five points, and futures prices rose or fell one to five points. British cotton spot prices fell five points, near months fell six points, and remaining months were unchanged. The Indian cotton market was small, with long positions being closed and met with local covering. Spot prices fell 0.75 rupees, Omra fell 1.25 rupees, and Baroach fell 1.25 rupees. The original telegrams are on the left (telegram from the 25th):</p>

<p>Recently, the oil market has been agitated by the surrounding environment, causing investors to be alarmed. Yesterday, rumors circulated frequently in the oil market, creating a very tense atmosphere. Standard Oil followed Dalian's example, halting new sales. Because of the fear that oil stocks were low and insufficient to meet demand, panic was widespread. This was partly driven by the surrounding environment and partly due to short covering. After the special margin requirement was increased in the second session, the situation gradually eased, showing that the Exchange's restrictions on speculation had some effect. The October contract rose $1, the November contract rose $0.85, the December contract rose $0.95, the January contract rose $1, and the February contract rose $0.95. Spot soybean oil also soared $0.90, and peanut oil jumped $0.50. Approximately 850 pieces of various soybean oils and 1,500 pieces of various peanut oils were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Tung Oil Continues to Fall <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Since the new crop of Tung oil has come to market, the prices of foreign firms have continued to plummet. Last week, due to the suspension of foreign firms' trading in Hankou, the market price of $80 per dan fell to $54.50. New oil from all producing areas is being rushed to market, so supply has increased, and the market cannot but fall. This week, prices have continued to fall to $50, and there is still a downward trend. Because foreign firms are only making a few transactions, the new oil production is several times higher than last year. Furthermore, everyone is rushing to deliver early, so recently, there has been a sudden shift to oversupply, which is why the market is falling sharply. Foreign firms in Shanghai are also only making a few transactions, and the selling price is also around $50. Production on the Zhejiang route has also increased significantly. Prices initially fell to $40 per stone, but have gradually fallen further, and may only reach $37 or $38.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Grains; Gold Prices Soar Unabated; Flour and Wheat Rise Sharply by About Ten Cents; Grain Exchange Implements Special Margin Requirements; $800 for Soybeans and Wheat; $400 for Oilcake <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The flour market has suddenly experienced an unusual surge, creating a serious situation, and the high prices are unprecedented. The only reason for the sharp rise is the unabated increase in gold prices, which has forced all commodity prices to rise. In recent days, because actual sales have been flat, investors have not been aggressive. Therefore, the rise in gold prices has only been in the range of three to five cents. However, yesterday, because speculators considered flour prices to be very favorable, they aggressively bought up the market. From the opening to the close in the morning, prices soared by five or six cents, and over 800,000 bags were traded. In the afternoon, the opening price increased because speculators were still buying as much as possible. The market continued to rise by another three or four cents, and 700,000 or 800,000 bags were traded. The increase in the January contract reached $0.1025, and the remaining months also increased by eight or nine cents. The danger of the situation is not difficult to imagine.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened higher in the morning, with prices rising in all months. Foreign wheat quotations rose three or four cents in Chicago and about ten cents in Canada. There was little actual impact, but because investors were agitated after the rise in the gold market, the wheat market rose only slightly. This situation indicated stability in the industry, so there was no widespread chaos. Unexpectedly, speculators were optimistic about the future, causing prices in all months to jump by about ten cents. In the afternoon, the market jumped again by three to five cents. In order to avoid danger, the Exchange increased the special margin requirement for new sales starting in the second session. The requirement was $800 per unit for wheat flour and soybeans and $400 for oilcake. After the margin requirement was increased, the trend gradually calmed down, falling by two or three cents from the highest level. Based on the actions to restrict speculation, the market may not see such wild fluctuations again.</p>

<p>Since the sharp rise in gold prices, wheat bran prices have also risen gradually due to foreign exchange rates. On Wednesday, the price had already reached $0.65, and yesterday, the prices quoted by various factories had reached $2.80. If gold prices continue to rise, prices will likely continue to rise.</p>

<p>Foreign Rice Recovers Four Cents in Afternoon</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources of rice from various regions suddenly surged, with a total of over seventy firms (with over 14,000 dan of goods). Sales were even more sluggish, and the market struggled to improve. As a result, transactions of famous brands were rare, and prices of both new and old japonica rice fell by 12 cents. Although several firms managed to sell off over 400 bags, they struggled to stay afloat and had to lower prices by 1.5 to 2 cents. Sales of the low-quality "canned" variety were also rare, and further sales were sluggish, with prices falling by 1 to 2 cents. Wild rice and other varieties also fell by 2 or 3 cents, while the price of high-quality Du Yang rice was slightly adjusted by a cent. Medium-quality rice also fell by nearly 2 cents, while poor-quality rice fell slightly.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the flow of goods from various routes in He Xia gradually increased, with about 40 or 50 firms. Sales of all kinds of goods on the market were sluggish. The market price of new japonica rice fell by 1 or 2 cents, the price of broken japonica fell by nearly a cent, the price of white rice was soft by about a cent, and the price of kiln and other low-quality rice fell by a few cents to nearly a cent. Sheep tip, Du tip, and Pu tip were slightly adjusted for small profits, with prices down about a cent. Few people inquired about guest tip, and the market was also weak. The prices of the remaining goods were stable.</p>
<p>(Guest Indica) The demand continued to be strong. The sales by the customer agencies were slightly sluggish. Local stores also did not compete. The market remained flat. The customer agency in Tianjin sold nearly 1,000 bags of Yongjiang willow indica. The stores in Water Street sold 787 bags of Jiang Si rice, over 1,000 bags of Yong rice, and over 300 bags of Wen Tai rice. The market prices were similar to those of the previous market.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Traders were still optimistic. There was little trading in the morning. Only 100 bags each of Saigon and Western goods were sold. Market prices were similar to those of the previous market. In the afternoon, the market suddenly became tense due to rumors that currency reform would be implemented. Local traders became active again. Another 1,100 bags of Saigon No. 1 were traded, and the price rose by four cents.</p>

<p>Raw Peanuts Also Rise by Fifty or Sixty Cents</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of dried longan pulp have been brisk, but the goods arriving are extremely scarce, so market prices have gradually risen. Yesterday, it was heard that only a dozen or so packages of Hainan longan pulp arrived, so the market situation was historically firm. The opening price immediately went up, more than seven or eight dollars higher than the previous closing price. Compared with the low price when the new product came out, the price has risen by more than forty dollars in total.</p>
<p>Although the volume of transactions of raw peanuts has been small recently, market prices are still rising continuously. Yesterday, more than 500 packages of Shandong raw peanuts were offered at eight dollars and twenty cents, an increase of fifty or sixty cents compared to the previous closing price. Other old goods dealers are also calling for higher prices. In the future, due to changes in the monetary system, prices are expected to continue to rise.</p>

<p>Hardware prices have recently been affected by the high exchange rate. Yesterday, the Iron Industry Association proposed a price increase, so the price of two-foot, six-foot, eighteen-gauge black iron sheets at nine dollars has already been purchased by thermos bottle factories for three or four hundred loads. The supply is extremely shallow, and the asking price is thirty dollars. Although the price has not yet been announced, people are already firm. The purchasing price of white lead by the Arsenal and other factories has also increased from eighteen dollars to twenty dollars. Although buyers are offering thirty dollars for No. 5 and No. 6 white lead sheets, it is said that there is still no stock available for purchase. Other bamboo steel bars, new lead wire, English copper plates, antimony, large lead bars, etc., are all gradually improving in price.</p>

<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>All social phenomena evoke endless emotions. This place seems like a wondrous garden, either overgrown with weeds or with fruit trees planted upside down. Looking at just two things, marriage and childcare, there's this kind of meaning. Children are society's new life, new hope. At a time when families that are barely able to feed themselves are increasingly disintegrating, childcare centers are so necessary for the working masses who go out to find food all day long. However, the city of Shanghai, which proudly possesses hundreds of thousands of female workers, only has one "First Labor Childcare Center" on Penglai Road, and its actual situation, according to yesterday's newspaper, is like this:</p>
<p>"Since its opening a year ago, the center has provided care and education for the children entrusted to it, and has been highly praised by parents. Unfortunately, its location is far from the factory area, and due to limited funding and other reasons, the children entrusted to it cannot be purely from the working class. Currently, the center has 30 children entrusted during the day, with a fee of two dollars; and 10 children entrusted day and night, with the fee increased from eight dollars to twelve dollars."</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are more than 100,000 children who are not cared for and need to be entrusted. However, the center can only accommodate this number, and it can be asserted that none of them are from the working class. So, the children of the working class either tire out their mothers, who cannot spare the time and die together with them, or crawl, wander, and die like insects. The mortality rate of children in our country is already at the same high level as India, a nation on the verge of extinction. We can imagine how dangerous it is! However, society's indifference to it can be said to be unsurpassed.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, society is vigorously emphasizing marriage. Each province and city is afraid that unmarried men and women will be restless, so they are vigorously helping them to find happiness and promoting convenient and economical group marriage systems. Since Shanghai initiated this last year, Tianjin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, and Kaifeng have successively implemented it, and there is a trend of spreading throughout the country. At each wedding, the elegant and beautiful figures of the newlyweds and the grand ceremony attended by the officials truly arouse people's interest and make them eager to try. Although sports are said to save the country, the average daily audience of ten thousand can never compare with the grand occasion of each group marriage. If anyone says this is a "marriage movement," it is unlikely to be opposed. The prevailing trend has aroused even seventy-year-old men. As for society's intense focus on the marriage of a certain celebrity, the engagement of a certain swimming star, or the love affair of a certain soccer star, this is even more the end of the trend.</p>
<p>Marriage is an important part of life, and society's emphasis on it has its own reasonable reasons. But thousands of years of traditional thinking have led women to regard marriage as the only major event in their lives—there is nothing else. And recently, due to the evil waves of economic recession, the purchasing power of men in the marriage market is very weak, and there are countless unmarried young ladies. They have already suffered enough from melancholy in their daily lives, so how can they withstand the strong stimulation of group marriages? Although the matter has not yet surfaced, there are many who are secretly withering away because of this. Since society has no impetus to shift their minds to other areas, the sorrow they increase for no reason is truly unjust.</p>
<p>If we take a broader view, marriage is only a private matter between men and women, and society has no need to cheer, applaud, help, or join in the fun. If the enthusiasm, time, money, and energy used in this area are shifted to childcare centers, wouldn't the benefits to society be far greater? Moreover, this would shift the public's attention, making people know what to value and what to take lightly, and the future of the nation could also be freed from a layer of darkness; social morality and the anxiety of unmarried women could be greatly adjusted.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Such a Charitable Maternity Hospital <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>——In the outpatient clinic——</p>
<p>It seems that as long as it is a person, everyone will say, "Giving birth to children is a woman's natural duty." But regardless of whether it is a natural duty or an earthly duty, people may say it is terribly important, but few people care about how to enable women to safely fulfill this duty. In recent years, although there have occasionally been people who have been baptized by science and who hold the rice bowl of obstetrics, shouting out on the newspapers that women must not be poisoned by traditional midwives again, and must go to maternity hospitals, no one has ever mentioned the extent of the equipment in maternity hospitals, the safety of maternity hospital deliveries for the lives of mothers and infants, and whether the treatment received by pregnant women in hospitals is sound.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the few maternity hospitals and the situation inside that this article is going to mention are certainly not the places where wealthy old men spend hundreds or thousands of taels of silver to live (according to reliable sources, the wife of a certain mayor gave birth and hired the president of a certain large hospital to deliver the baby, and the delivery fee was one thousand taels of silver). On the contrary, since it is called "charitable," it is a place where wealthy people open the door of convenience for poor people. The charitable maternity hospitals mentioned here are all maternity departments in charitable hospitals with religious affiliations that imperialists use as a means of cultural invasion.</p>
<p>Although there are many relatively complete private maternity hospitals in Shanghai, the lack of economic power deprives poor pregnant women of the freedom to choose doctors and maternity hospitals, and some poor pregnant women's knowledge in their minds prevents them from trusting traditional midwives. Therefore, in the one or two months before giving birth, they have to brace their bulging bellies and settle on the last road—that is, to go to a charitable maternity hospital run by a religious organization to try their luck.</p>
<p>I am also one of the women who is about to fulfill her "natural duty," and this "natural duty" is the third time I am fulfilling it. The dangers and horrors I have experienced and seen in the past are now constantly reminding me to prepare for the third time as soon as possible. Like those of us who are often followed by thieves, although we have suffered great losses in charitable maternity hospitals, this time, we still have to knock on the door of heaven, hoping that God has a conscience and that the doctors and nurses I encounter are responsible and humane.</p>
<p>Just like that, I walked into one of the largest charitable hospitals in Shanghai at 8:30 in the morning, with a seven-month-old fetus in my belly like a kangaroo. After paying 300 cash for registration, it was already 9:30. Although the regulations clearly stipulate that the obstetrics and gynecology clinic hours are from 10:00 to 11:00 in the morning, the doctor's shadow had not been seen by 10:45. In a small waiting room crowded with big bellies and gynecological patients, there was also an old man carrying a large bag of strange books, preaching while selling them. He kept murmuring something like "The Kingdom of Heaven is near" and other nonsense. But it was really "The Kingdom of Heaven is near," because a great doctor walked into the examination room with an air of great importance, followed closely by a gorgeously dressed fashionable woman. Everyone's hearts and eyes suddenly lit up, thinking that they would be rescued immediately; who knew that about a quarter of an hour later, the great doctor and the fashionable woman walked out of the examination room one after the other with an air of great importance. At this time, a middle-aged woman who had been waiting for a long time at the door of the examination room suppressed her temper and asked the nurse in a low voice, "Miss, why doesn't the doctor see me? I'm number one." The nurse, with a face full of freckles and somewhat like a shrew, scolded disdainfully, "The doctor hasn't come yet, that's Doctor ×'s own patient, understand?"</p>
<p>Just as I was wondering what "the doctor's own patient" meant, a big belly next to me told me, "This Doctor × is a bastard. When I came to check my second child the year before last, I ran into him. He shamelessly took advantage of the nurse's absence and pinched my thigh. I gave him a good slap."</p>
<p>While we were talking like this, a few wealthy ladies walked in, each accompanied by several nanny-like people, followed by two female trainee doctors in uniforms. The noisy people gradually calmed down again, and everyone focused all their attention on the examination room.</p>
<p>Soon, the examination room really roared like a furnace that had added coal, but the first to be called in for examination were the nanny-like people brought by the wealthy ladies. After careful inquiries, I learned that they were all milkmaids who sold their blood for two dollars of special registration fee and five dollars of blood test fee paid by the ladies.</p>
<p>It had been going on until after twelve o'clock, and I was finally called into the examination room by the shrew-like nurse. It didn't take three minutes for a seven-month pregnant woman to be examined for the first time, and all the procedures were completed. When I walked out of the hospital door, I was still wondering. But there was one thing that I saw clearly; that was the urine that I was told to excrete for testing was in the same urinal, and a gynecological patient had also urinated on top of my urine. This perfunctory and irresponsible outpatient service immediately evoked the terrifying scenes I had seen in the maternity hospital before, and I really shuddered in the heat.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e195">Selling a Daughter <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanquan</p>
<p>The river turned a bend, and the increasingly distant and delicate stern of the boat finally disappeared from sight. With a resentful gaze, she stared intently at the long stretch of undulating waves that had been broken by the boat's oars. It seemed as if she wanted to blame it for its dry belly during the summer, which had dried up the rice in the fields and ruined everyone's livelihood. Now, it was gurgling and carrying the boat away with her daughter, never to return. The inability to suppress and eliminate the anger in her belly made Shun Gu's mother begin to realize the childishness of this curse-like expression.</p>
<p>There was still little sound from the nearby houses. The door of her own house was ajar. In the open space in front of the door, a faint light of the early sun shone. When she thought of the lively scene of a pigtail-tugging, east-jumping, west-bouncing scene that would never reappear, her heart became even heavier and beyond words. She pushed the door in a daze and collapsed onto a broken chair in a daze; a burst of wailing that she could no longer hold back immediately shook the cold air in the small house and alarmed the kind-hearted people of the same fate in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>"Shun Gu was sent away today? ... Look on the bright side! There's not enough to wear or eat at home, but at least she'll survive outside. Moreover, thirty-odd dollars is not a small amount, and if you put a little more together, you can get through until the 'Chunhua' harvest. It's not good for the whole family to starve to death; and besides, you're finally paying off that rent you owe?"</p>
<p>"Yes, who isn't suffering these days? Didn't Sister A-Yu sell her clever A-Cui a few days ago? Old Man Bing also sold the sturdy ox that had been his companion for many years. Those who have no children or livestock are selling off everything they can't live without! Alas, what can we do!"</p>
<p>"Really, Heaven wants us to suffer, what can we say! Have you forgotten that Brother A-Liang picked out his newborn baby and exchanged it for a dollar? Raising her to seven or eight years old is enough to do her justice. We have no choice but to sell to save our own lives!"</p>
<p>"Alas, she's going to be a little nun! She hasn't even properly lived a day of her life, and she's being wrongly sent into the empty gate. Isn't that a living sin? When she grows up and understands things, she'll resent her parents for being so cruel. Poor thing, she really thought she was going to the provincial capital to play, and she was laughing and waving to me all the way on the bow of the boat!"</p>
<p>"Moreover, the more people who eat vegetarian food and chant Buddhist scriptures, the narrower their minds and the more ruthless their hearts. She might end up in a misfortune where she is beaten and scolded day and night. Wouldn't that really make Shun Gu suffer?"</p>
<p>The fat-headed and chubby-faced image floated into her mind, clearly, with a pair of bright and piercing eyes embedded in it. When the whole family went to the provincial capital to negotiate with the nunnery three days ago, the reason that made her most unwilling to make the deal was that the nun's appearance was outwardly kind but inwardly treacherous, and she was afraid that Shun Gu would not be able to endure her torment. However, for the sake of money, her mother-in-law agreed, her husband was willing, and she could only say a little more to learn more about the great principles of life. She helplessly waited for the coming of the living separation that was equivalent to death, and for several days, she had been inseparable from Shun Gu until this morning.</p>
<p>But now her hands were empty. When she thought that she would no longer be able to get that kind of innocent and lovely comfort in her spare time after work, a more intense heartache was accompanied by the memory of her youngest son who died in the spring of last year—because she had a fever after childbirth, dried up her milk, had no money to send her out to find milk, and couldn't afford any milk or soy milk, the infant, who was still very lacking in life skills, finally starved to death alive in half a month.</p>
<p>The low mourning, accompanied by sobs and narrations, turned into a fierce and tragic cry. This individual's cry encompassed the common suffering of the masses; this made her companions unable to help but sigh and wipe their tears frequently while repeatedly comforting her, each grieving for their own but universally the same fate.</p>
<p>However, time was not something they could waste at will, unlike some people; finally, everyone thought that they had to continue to fight with their own muscles and fate, hurriedly offered their last words of earnest persuasion, and successively went to do their own lives.</p>
<p>A series of messy but familiar footsteps stopped in front of the door. The wind quickly pushed open the half-closed firewood door, bringing in a ray of slanted sunlight that was still very strong. In the dazzling sunlight, who was jumping closer to her mother but Shun Gu, for whom she had been breaking her heart for several days and crying her eyes dry in the middle of the day?</p>
<p>Silence and surprise occupied a moment. Finally, with an annoyed tone, her husband told the story of the breakdown of the transaction as if he were angry at himself and complaining to someone</p>
<p>"What kind of compassion do these monks have! They clearly agreed on four dollars per year that day, for a total of thirty-two dollars. But today they went back on their word again, saying that heads are not worth much these days, that thirty-two dollars is too expensive, that cutting off the odd change would make it an even number, that they must pay the original price and they didn't want it, and said a lot of things. Despite our repeated pleas, kowtows, and prayers, and saying everything we could say, we couldn't move her heart at all. Later, she simply said that we had to pay the middleman's fee ourselves. This thief nun, who would have thought that she said these words on purpose; when I couldn't bear the anger and said that it would be better to make her a foster daughter, she eagerly said good, good, you can just go and make her a foster daughter, I won't force you. Get out quickly, get out of here immediately. Like chasing away beggars, that's how we left that thief nunnery."</p>
<p>Now, Shun Gu's mother clearly knew that her daughter was returning to her, and an unexpected and simple joy temporarily filled her whole body; she dared not express it, but could not suppress it, gently stroking her daughter's small hands and tidying up the messy hair on her head. But when she looked up, her eyes met her mother-in-law's gloomy face and her husband's angry gaze, and immediately, a dark shadow of fear of life enveloped her heart again.</p>
<p>"Damn it, what a clever idea someone came up with; selling one's own children to temporarily prolong a dog's miserable life! Can children be sold endlessly? Do people who don't have children not live? What about those of us who can't sell our daughters? Langfadi always says 'We should find a smarter and more meaningful way out,' and I'm just starting to understand a little now! I'm going to ask him for advice."</p>
<p>After saying these words, Shun Gu's master's back foot had already stepped outside the threshold.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Lecture 10 Historical Examination of Women's Liberation Thought <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Section 1 Democratic Women's Liberation Thought</p>
<p>As we know, so-called democracy or liberalism is the most effective tool for the modern bourgeoisie to break the feudal autocracy. That is to say, when the bourgeoisie established a foundation on the ruins of the feudal society, it raised the banner of democracy and called on the oppressed masses under the feudal system. As a result, the oppressed women also bravely gathered into the democratic anti-feudal camp! In this way, they consciously began to demand equal rights for women and men in society. And in this way, the democratic women's liberation thought was formed.</p>
<p>This democratic liberation thought gave rise to so-called Feminism. Feminism can be translated as feminism or gender equality. Regarding its meaning, many people have different interpretations, but in general, it is to obtain equal rights with men under the capitalist social system. In other words, feminists do not oppose the existence of private property and class domination, but only oppose men's domination over women, do not want to change the current social system, but only demand equal rights with men, and only recognize the opposition between men and women, and deny the opposition of social classes. This kind of thought is essentially a product of bourgeois democracy or liberalism, and represents the thought of bourgeois women who were in the process of liberation at that time.</p>
<p>It can be said that the idea of ​​feminism originated from Rousseau's "Social Contract," but the "Declaration of Women's Rights" published by Gouges and Madame Roland during the French Revolution in the 18th century was the initial concrete performance of this thought. At the same time, in 1792, the British Ms. Wollstonecraft published the book "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman," which more specifically demanded equal rights for women and men in society. The prototype of feminism was completed and widely spread to European and American countries. Therefore, the world calls Wollstonecraft the originator of feminism.</p>
<p>Later, in the middle of the 19th century, with the establishment and development of bourgeois democratic regimes, feminist thought spread throughout European and American countries. The representative figures of this kind of thought can be regarded as John Stuart Mill in England, and Susan B. Anthony and Charlotte Perkins Gilman in the United States, and Ellen Key in Sweden. Their views on women are not consistent. For example, Mill was an enthusiastic advocate of women's suffrage. In his famous book "The Subjection of Women," he especially emphasized the legal status of women, that is, he mainly discussed the issue of women's liberation from a legal point of view. Susan B. Anthony wrote the book "Women and Labor," mainly explaining the liberation of women from the perspective of labor. Mrs. Gilman wrote the book "Women and Economics," mainly exploring the issue of women from an economic point of view. Finally, Ellen Key wrote books such as "The Century of the Child," "Love and Marriage," "The Women's Movement," and "The Rebirth of Motherhood," advocating the omnipotence of motherhood and the supremacy of love, and wanting to solve the problem of women from the perspective of both sexes. Due to space limitations, their specific opinions cannot be described in detail here, but in short, they are all feminists, and their thoughts are not unified. In other words, so-called feminist thought originally did not have any independent and unified system.</p>
<p>However. There is one point that should be paid special attention to here, that is, Ellen Key's views on love and motherhood are often maliciously used by people. She advocates protecting motherhood and advocating the unique freedom of motherhood, in order to freely choose love and marriage and fully develop the sexual ability of motherhood. He said: "All current efforts are preparing to create a better human race, which is the great driving force of passionate love. There is no such driving force other than love and parental love." In order to create a better human race, we must wait for the completion of motherhood, and women have the right to demand the completion of this motherhood, and society should of course bear this obligation. She advocates that women's natural duty is to be a wife and a mother, and opposes women engaging in labor outside the family or running around in political movements. She said:</p>
<p>"If women cannot get rid of the parasitic state of life from the past except by engaging in labor outside the family, then we would rather choose that kind of high-level life. Because of these two social evils, the latter is less harmful than the former."</p>
<p>Ellen Key's thought is contrary to the claims of general feminists. In detail, American feminists are against the parasitic life of being a wife and a mother, and advocate that women go deep into society and engage in the same activities as men. But from Ellen Key's point of view, this phenomenon is destroying the family, neglecting the great mission of women to be wives and mothers, and making the relationship between the two sexes a monetary transaction relationship without the so-called pure love marriage life. Therefore, Ellen Key especially emphasizes pure love and motherhood protection.</p>
<p>In short, feminist thought is a branch of bourgeois democratic thought. Although it does not have a certain unified system, it is consistent in opposing the abolition of private property and class struggle. This kind of thought has now completely lost its practical social significance.</p>

<h3 id="e197">A Proper Treatment for Gonorrhea <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Peiji</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a difficult disease to treat. However, with the progress of modern science, there are now quite appropriate methods for treating this complex condition. As long as the doctor is skilled in treatment and the patient knows how to care for themselves, the recovery period need not be very long. Currently, the most appropriate and thorough method for treating gonorrhea is considered to be: (1) shortwave diathermy, which uses heat to kill bacteria, and its ability to penetrate deeply into the mucous membrane far surpasses that of pigments; (2) mixed gonorrhea vaccine injection, which is an autoimmune therapy, can be said to be extremely reasonable for treating gonorrhea, achieving radical cure without the risk of variation. This treatment can cure urethral diseases caused by gonorrhea, and can also effectively treat various severe gonorrhea-related conditions such as orchitis and arthritis. Medical circles in various countries highly recommend this method, which shows its value; (3) oral medication, which should be selected for its ability to penetrate deeply into the mucous membrane and kill bacteria, such as "Mesaltropin"; (4) local cleansing, using ordinary disinfectant solutions containing silver is not appropriate. Recently, "Gonc-Serol," produced by the German Mann &amp;amp; Schroeer GmbH, a mixed preparation of gonorrhea serum and Serol, is the leader among external medications for gonorrhea. It is now sold at Ren Shou Dispensary, No. 1, Lao De Xing Li, Minyi Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. When implementing this treatment method, it is also necessary to carefully select a doctor, otherwise, slight discrepancies in the allocation of dosage, time, etc., will have a significant impact. The Chun Zai Hospital at No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, is presided over by the famous Shanghai doctor, Mr. Feng Shanmu, and comprehensively treats internal and external medicine, as well as all venereal diseases. It has especially comprehensive facilities for the treatment of gonorrhea, such as vacuum tube shortwave diathermy machines, which can be said to be the best in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e198">The Nerves and Gastrointestinal Tract of Patients Quitting Smoking <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Physician She Dian</p>
<p>Any medication, when used for a long time, will inevitably have drawbacks. There is nothing that can be used constantly without harm. The same is true for opium. The consequences of long-term opium use on the human body are astonishing and difficult to describe in detail. I will now discuss the common symptoms that are inevitable for those with opium addiction: (1) Their nerves must be weak. This is due to the constant damage to the brain and spinal cord caused by the anesthetic power of opium. The degree of weakness varies greatly, depending on the person. It is not fixed, but is especially evident in the sexual nerves. If a sufficient amount of opium is not consumed, symptoms of sexual neurasthenia such as nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation will inevitably occur, which is clear evidence of this; (2) Their digestive capacity must be weak. This is due to the long-term changes in the function of the stomach and intestines and the secretion of digestive juices. One can see that those with opium addiction often suffer from constipation and poor appetite, which is the reason for this. Regardless of the method of quitting smoking, in addition to first matching the physique with an appropriate method to eliminate the old ailment without pain, the nerves and gastrointestinal tract of the quitter should be regulated with appropriate medication. Otherwise, how can one properly deal with the consequences of quitting, such as nocturnal emission, fatigue, loss of appetite, and mental weariness? (Editor's Note: Physician She Lei practices medicine at Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Boning Road, French Concession, Shanghai. The fee for quitting smoking is two yuan per day, including injections and oral medication.)</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Advantages of "Misrlzine" in Treating Skin Diseases <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Physician He Tianlu</p>
<p>There are many specialized agents for treating skin diseases on the market, but it is rare to find one that possesses the following advantages and has a rapid and miraculous effect on stubborn sores and malignant ringworm. When examining medications for skin diseases, one must seek: (1) non-irritating properties, otherwise, preparations such as alcohol are prone to causing local inflammation and expanding the affected area; (2) that they do not cause absorption into the skin and harm internal organs; (3) that they have a definite effect of relieving itching, so that the patient does not scratch and the affected area does not expand; (4) that they have strong bactericidal power without any irritation or side effects; (5) that they do not stain clothing and have a pleasant fragrance that does not cause aversion. Only those that complete these five points can be called a holy agent for treating skin diseases. "Misrlzine" perfectly fulfills these five points. Since being promoted by Doctors Wu Sheng and Lian Zhiyao, it has long been renowned in the medical community, and doctors and patients alike are happy to use it, which shows that it must have special effects. (Editor's Note: Misrlzine is sold at Ren Shou Dispensary, No. 1, Lao De Xing Li, Miniyi Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. The Western medicine departments of the Sincere and Wing On department stores in Shanghai, as well as the Wuzhou, Nanyang, Si Ma Road, Zhongxi, Ximen, Heping Road, and Huacheng pharmacies on Nanjing Road, also sell it for one yuan per box.)</p>
<h3 id="e200">Case Studies of Gonorrhea Treatment <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>Patient Zhang, infected with gonorrhea for nearly a month, had sought medical treatment and taken medication, but had not recovered after three weeks. Diagnosis: subacute urethral gonorrhea. Treatment: short-wave diathermy, mixed gonorrhea vaccine injection, oral "Mesaltropin" pills, and local injection of "Gonc-Serol" into the urethra. After about ten days, the pus discharge disappeared completely, the urine became clear, and microscopic examination showed no gonorrhea bacteria. Patient Xu, suffering from acute anterior urethral gonorrhea, had a large amount of pus discharge, painful urination, and swelling of the penis. After three days without treatment, I administered a mixed injection of mixed gonorrhea vaccine and Antigens, and performed the latest turbidimetric sterilization method, with oral "Mesaltropin" pills and local injection of "Gonc-Serol" into the urethra. After four days, the urethral fluid had cleared, there was no pus discharge, and the sensation of swelling and pain had completely disappeared. Due to circumstances, he could not continue treatment, so I instructed him to continue taking "Mesaltropin" pills and externally apply "Gonc-Serol" for about a week. He returned to Shanghai and had an examination, the result of which showed only a few epithelial cells. (Editor's Note: "Mesaltropin" and "Gonc-Serol" are both sold at Ren Shou Dispensary, No. 1, Lao De Xing Li, Miniyi Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. The former is one yuan per box, and the latter is two yuan and fifty cents per box. Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, is fully equipped with short-wave diathermy machines and the latest turbidity treatment machines, as well as other gonorrhea treatment equipment, and the fees for surgery and injections are very low.)</p>
<h3 id="e201">Common Symptoms of Stomach Ailments <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Wei Zunsan</p>
<p>Among the acute stomach diseases, such as stomach cancer and stomach ulcers, most have poor outcomes and are rare in clinical practice. The most common are acute gastritis, chronic gastritis, and hyperacidity. The symptoms exhibited by these conditions are nothing more than nausea, vomiting, acid regurgitation, heartburn, recurring pain, abdominal distension, fullness after eating, loss of appetite, and digestive disorders. Further severe phenomena are sufficient to cause anemia, emaciation, and mental fatigue. A person's nutrition depends entirely on appetite. Poor appetite means there is no nutrition to speak of. When examining the treatment of these conditions, drug therapy relies on alkali preparations. Among the alkali preparations I have used, I believe that "Wei Bao," sold by Ren Shou Dispensary, No. 1, Lao De Xing Li, Miniyi Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai, is the most effective when properly combined. This medicine can eliminate the above-mentioned symptoms of stomach ailments such as vomiting and pain, and can also regulate stomach function. It is truly a good medicine for stomach ailments, and I heard that each box sells for only two yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e202">On the Necessity of Circumcision for Phimosis <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>If the foreskin of the penis is too tight and the glans cannot be exposed, or if the foreskin of the penis is too long and the glans is often covered, both of these are sufficient to cause inflammation of the foreskin and glans. Because the area between the foreskin and glans easily harbors dirt and grime, diligent washing is extremely troublesome. In those with tight foreskin, there is fundamentally no possibility of self-washing. Once inflammation occurs and treatment is sought, the indescribable pain has already been endured in vain. In addition, those suffering from phimosis, due to the obstruction of the foreskin, cannot ejaculate semen directly during intercourse, which is sufficient to affect fertility. Therefore, whether the foreskin is too tight or too long, it should be removed as a matter of course. How can one procrastinate out of fear, thereby depriving oneself of life's happiness and constantly suffering from undeserved ailments? (Editor's Note: Physician Cui Fuqing is currently practicing medicine at Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, specializing in surgery. He has rich experience in circumcision and is painless. One can return to work as usual after the procedure, and there are absolutely no other complications. The cost of surgery and anesthesia is only ten yuan.)</p>
<h3 id="e203">From Hard Chancre to Tertiary Syphilis <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>The most common symptom of a primary syphilis infection is often hard chancre. At this time, it is extremely easy to cure radically. However, this condition can heal on its own without treatment, and can also heal with just disinfectant antiseptic medication, and even heal with erroneous treatment. Therefore, it often transforms into secondary symptoms, such as syphilitic papules. At this time, if sufficient treatment is administered, it can also be cured radically. However, many people only receive a few injections of 606, and stop treatment once the papules gradually disappear. How can this be expected to eradicate the disease? Later, when tertiary symptoms reappear, such as severe nasal bridge depression, some people even deny that 606 can treat syphilis. However, using medication is like using soldiers; it depends on proper application. Moreover, the treatment of syphilis originally does not only involve 606 arsenic alone.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Hysteria in the Nervous System <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Here, I can only describe the common symptoms of various different conditions, which are now called Hysteria Diathesis. The characteristics and reactions of hysteria, in the area of ​​perception, have (A) numbness, mostly in the entire or half side of the body, including the mucous membrane, or a segment of a limb. Many have narrowed visual fields, and there are often those with blindness, deafness, and loss of taste and smell. (B) Hypersensitivity in various skin areas, the stimulation of which can sometimes cause convulsive attacks. (C) Pain, headache, back pain, stomach pain, neuralgia of various nerves and joints. (D) All kinds of perceptual abnormalities, abnormal sensations in the internal organs, globus hystericus, ovarian sensations, etc. The most important thing in practice is the following fact: a severe hysterical state can also be caused by trauma, such as occupational injury, traumatic neurasthenia, injury, and war neurasthenia. However, this kind of neurasthenia is not caused by trauma. Its cause is the associated emotions, such as horror, anxiety, etc. Usually, the period between the injury and the initial onset of the illness is a week or several days. The injured person may begin to feel tired, various pains, dizziness, poor sleep, and weakness in the limbs after returning to work, leading to a state of neurasthenia. Weight loss occurs because there is often no major change that can be proven at the site of the illness, and patients are very easily suspected of faking the illness. Therefore, when diagnosing this type of nervous system condition, a precise and detailed examination must be performed to find the correct source of the illness before treatment. Currently, this condition can commonly occur from improper actions, such as masturbation and excessive sexual activity. The most appropriate treatment for neurasthenia is to replenish the body's fluids and internal secretions, on the one hand conducting proper hygiene under the guidance of a doctor, using short-wave diathermy machines, and on the other hand taking German-made Arlo Sen tablets sold by Ren Shou Dispensary, which are specially designed to treat all diseases of the nervous system and have special efficacy. Each box sells for only one yuan and five jiao. (Editor's Note: Ren Shou Dispensary is located at No. 1, Lao De Xing Li, Miniyi Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai.)</p>

<h3 id="e207">The Question of British-French Cooperation <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Ru</p>
<p>Every shot fired in East Africa shakes the soul of the British Empire. This is because if Italy defeats Abyssinia, not only will Britain's colonies in Africa feel a direct threat, but its sea route from the Mediterranean to the Far East will also be liable to be cut off at any time, thus endangering the disintegration of the British Empire. Therefore, since the sound of Mussolini's first shot towards Africa was heard, the atmosphere in London has been particularly tense. In addition to continuing to deploy defenses in the Mediterranean, the British government has also intensified its activities in Geneva, demanding that the League of Nations resolve to recognize Italy as an aggressor and impose sanctions on it. However, to deal with Italy effectively, Britain does not dare to take risks alone under the current situation. At the very least, it must have the considerable understanding of France before it dares to take action. Therefore, since the East Africa incident, Eden has been running between Paris, London, and Geneva, asking the French to support its sanctions against Italy, and the voices of British-French cooperation have become increasingly louder.</p>
<p>Originally, British and French diplomacy both used the League of Nations to enhance their own importance. But at present, Britain's attention is focused on the Mediterranean, while France is focused on the Rhine. Therefore, when Britain asked France to sanction Italy, France asked Britain whether it would impose the same sanctions on aggressors in Central Europe in the future; when Britain asked for French naval assistance in the Mediterranean, France also asked for the cooperation of the British army, navy, and air force. In this bargaining negotiation, Britain and France have gained considerable understanding and are gradually approaching each other. Now, the League of Nations has passed a resolution on sanctions against Italy, France has responded to the issue of naval aid to Britain, and the Italian-Ethiopian armistice negotiations are also underway, so some overly optimistic people say that the dawn of peace has appeared and the war may be avoided.</p>
<p>Indeed, British-French relations have a major role to play in the question of war and peace; if Britain and France can really cooperate and unanimously oppress Mussolini, it may be possible to make Italy "stop at the right time." But judging from the current situation, it can be said that Britain and France have gained considerable understanding on certain points; to say that Britain and France have thoroughly cooperated is a premature judgment. We believe that Britain and France can only be consistent in maintaining the existence of the League of Nations and in maintaining the temporary stability of Europe, so France can only try to make Italy "stop at the right time," and Britain can only be responsible to France on general security issues. It is very difficult when it comes to truly jointly confronting Italy or jointly confronting Germany. Because it is not easy for Britain to completely sacrifice the British-German understanding gained from the London Naval Treaty, and it is not easy for France to tear up the French-Italian Rome Agreement on its own. In fact, the recent replies from France and Britain only stated that if the British navy suffers an unreasonable attack from the Italian navy, the French navy can provide assistance; on the other hand, if the British navy wants to attack Italy and implement military sanctions, then it is a problem in France. As for the issue of sanctions, France only stated that it agreed to implement economic sanctions, but "has not considered" issues such as blockading the Suez Canal or blockading Italian ports. Similarly, London has not made a concrete response to France's request for joint defense against Germany. The recent statements made by British Prime Minister Baldwin and Foreign Minister Hoare are also some empty talk of "maintaining the alliance" and "maintaining peace," and have not made any concrete expressions regarding France's request. In Hoare's speech, there was a passage worth pondering: "The great experiment we are currently conducting is unprecedented in the world for generations. The collective security mechanism is now being implemented for the first time. If the experiment is successful, we will not find it difficult to sit back and watch its effectiveness; if the experiment is unsuccessful, then all those who advocate not using war as a national tool will suffer a major blow of disappointment. If this experiment fails, then those who participate in the action with a wavering attitude should bear a major responsibility. ...Who is faithfully upholding the collective security system, and who is shouting high to uphold the collective security system, but attacking and provoking the countries that implement collective security? We can almost identify them." The implication is already obvious. - From this we can say that under the current situation, the so-called British-French cooperation is limited.</p>
<p>Naturally, even such limited British-French cooperation has a great influence on the European situation. It is very clear that due to France's participation in economic sanctions and its conditional naval assistance to the British in the Mediterranean, Mussolini feels that the situation is not very certain. Although the effectiveness of the so-called economic sanctions is limited because Japan, the United States, and Germany stand outside the League of Nations and because the interests of European countries are different, Italy has lost more than 130 million lire in its expedition to East Africa, and its economic and political crisis is developing. Under this circumstance, even the economic sanctions that Britain and France can do are a major blow to it. Therefore, Mussolini is conducting military and diplomatic activities at the same time at this time, preparing for war on the one hand and proposing ceasefire conditions for negotiations on the other, in order to ease the situation. According to general observation, if British-French cooperation can continue to develop, then the conditions proposed by Italy may gradually decrease, so the East African issue may be temporarily resolved. Such a possibility certainly exists. However, this possibility will not become a reality in a short period of time; if the time for resolving the issue is extended to several months or a year, then night will be long and dreams will be many, and the results will still be unpredictable.</p>
<p>To go a step further, even if Britain and France can cooperate further, the European situation cannot be estimated simply and optimistically. First, France and the Soviet Union are now very friendly, while Britain has always been the organizer of the anti-Soviet front. If Britain and France cooperate further, it is a big question whether Britain will become friendly with the Soviet Union as a result. Britain's pulling of France does not necessarily mean that it wants to be close to Russia, and Britain's toleration of Italy does not necessarily mean that it wants to oppose Germany; similarly, France's cooperation with Britain does not necessarily mean that it wants to oppose Italy or even Russia, and it certainly does not necessarily mean that it wants to be close to Germany; they all have their own hidden intentions even in their cooperation. What Britain wants is to use France to ease the conflict between Britain and Italy, to strive to mediate the contradictions between France and Germany, and to incite Germany to advance eastward; France's attempt is to unite Britain while also pulling in the Soviet Union and Italy to defend against Germany, but these two attempts are clearly in conflict. Second, if Britain and France can cooperate further, it will inevitably prompt Germany and Italy to join hands, thereby further forming a combination of Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Poland, becoming a new group force in Europe. At that time, it is also quite questionable whether Britain, France, and even the Soviet Union can unite as they did before the war and confront Germany, Italy, etc., replaying the tragedy that occurred in 1914. Therefore, third, even if Britain and France can cooperate further, its future is still difficult to say; and the changes in the European situation still cannot be concluded simply.</p>
<p>But no matter what, we can say that the crisis of the Second World War is still very great; moreover, no one can say how long it will take for this crisis to become a reality. Judging from the current situation, the Italian-Ethiopian issue cannot be resolved in the short term; even if Britain and France can cooperate within a certain limit to force Italy to "stop at the right time" so that the East African issue can be temporarily eased or temporarily resolved, the war will soon break out in other places and on other issues. In Austria, in the Baltic Sea, in the Balkans, in the Far East, ... the world is full of gunpowder! When the last World War was about to break out, the great powers were desperately expanding their military equipment, so someone asked at that time: Who are those weapons used to target? Now the military equipment of the great powers is many times higher in quality than during the last World War. At this time, can you not raise the question of who those weapons are used to target?</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Miao People's "Drum-Pulling Festival" <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zu'an</p>
<p>Correspondence from Rong County, Guangxi</p>
<p>The Miao and Yi people, who live scattered across the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, hold so many various grand ceremonies to worship gods each year that it would be impossible to list them all. However, the absurd and preposterous nature of these ceremonies is largely the same. The Miao people's "Drum-Pulling Festival" discussed here is one of the most important and exceptionally absurd of these sacred gatherings.</p>
<p>The Drum-Pulling Festival is the most important of all the Miao people's sacred gatherings, and its rituals are more solemn and grand than those of other such gatherings. The expenses required are also enormous, often requiring the pooled wealth of an entire Miao clan or a significant portion thereof to stage this grand celebration. To us, this may seem like a foolish act that is absurd, pointless, wasteful, and mentally exhausting. However, they believe it is related to the prosperity and decline of the race and the abundance of the harvest. Even if they are so poor that they struggle to feed themselves, they still hold it on schedule. From this, we can imagine that what dominates the consciousness of the Miao people is not the science of the 20th century, but divine authority.</p>
<p>Although the cost of holding the "Drum-Pulling Festival" is enormous, fortunately, it only occurs once every thirteen years, with the period for each festival usually around November of the year. When the festival is approaching, enthusiastic elder Miao people from various villages prepare everything, procuring pigs, cattle, and food. Each festival requires anywhere from a dozen to dozens of pigs and cattle. Even if a particular village lacks the financial resources to prepare such a large offering, the villagers must tighten their belts and painfully sacrifice in order to wish for a bountiful year. On the first day of the grand festival, two leaders are publicly elected from each village, along with a dozen or so wealthy individuals to lead the ceremony. Each leader must offer twelve or thirteen aquatic creatures, while the wealthy individuals offer one each, or several contribute to one. Once all preparatory procedures are completed, the elder Miao people in charge of preparations notify each village of the date to attend the ceremony.</p>
<p>On the day of the grand festival, a spacious sandy flat area is found by a river. There, a bed is set up, with the surroundings completely covered with hanging paintings of various animals such as fish, crows, insects, and mice, arranged like a shrine in a temple. At this time, the wealthiest person who offered the most sacrifices lies down on the bed, face up, eyes tightly closed, holding their breath silently like a dead person, not allowed to twitch in the slightest. The crowd then believes they are the incarnation of the "Black Dog"—Note: explained later—and roars with joy, slaughtering cattle and pigs, burning incense, and celebrating. All the raw meat sacrifices and the misty incense smoke surround the pseudo-dead person—the wealthy individual—and thousands of people breathe on them. However, the wealthy individual, even in such an environment, is not allowed to move even once.</p>
<p>After the crowd completes the sacrifices, they take a "Dou Fei Yao" tree—Note: transliteration of the Miao language, details below—which can be several dozen or several feet long, depending on the size of the crowd. They hollow out the center of the tree and pass a thick, sturdy rope through it, tying countless smaller ropes to both ends. Every participating member of the crowd, regardless of age or gender, holds one of these ropes and pulls against each other. The scene resembles construction workers in the interior driving piles. Both ends pull back and forth, and they shout loudly in unison, filling the entire venue with a crazed atmosphere. This is a scene of "Drum-Pulling." While "Drum-Pulling" is in progress, two or three hundred people play the "Lusheng" to add to the excitement, spending the whole day from morning to night in a mood of joy and exhilaration. However, the one suffering is the wealthy individual. While the crowd is celebrating at the peak of excitement, they must remain motionless like a dead person; otherwise, the "Drum-Pulling" upon which the rise and fall of the race depends will fail, and the lives of all the Miao people will be in grave danger!</p>
<p>Thus, until dusk, when everyone feels tired and hungry after excessive excitement, the "Drum-Pulling" is declared over. Everyone gathers in front of the god—the wealthy individual—to cook and eat the pork and beef, and the remainder is divided and distributed to everyone by the next wealthiest person to take back home. As for the wealthy individual who played dead, they can only get up from the bed and go back to eat something after the crowd has left. By the time the three-day ritual ceremony is over, this wealthy individual who played dead, even if they do not die, will suffer a major illness. It is even common for someone to actually die from playing dead. Although this behavior is foolish, the selected wealthy individual does not refuse because they believe that dying on the bed like this is to be assimilated with the gods, which is an honor they could not wish for more!</p>
<p>After the three days of the "Drum-Pulling Festival" are over, all participating members of the crowd visit each other's homes to offer congratulations, celebrating the attainment of wealth and happiness. The hosts slaughter pigs and cattle, inviting the guests to eat and drink to their hearts' content for several days. Generally, young men and women are usually prevented from getting close to each other due to the restrictions of etiquette, but during these few days, they can openly perform their comedy. Even if parents see it, they do not blame them, and sometimes even help to make it happen. Therefore, the young men and women of the Miao people greatly hope that the "Drum-Pulling Festival" will be held frequently, so that they can complete their good deeds. It is only a pity that it can only be held once every thirteen years, which they cannot help but consider a regrettable thing!</p>
<p>The thirtieth day after the "Drum-Pulling Festival" is called "Full Moon." On this day, the Miao people from each village piously carry the "Dou Fei Yao" tree up the mountain, hold a ceremony of worship and reverence, and then the entire sacred ceremony is considered complete.</p>
<p>Speaking of the origin of this "Drum-Pulling Festival," it is simply a mythological story. According to a Miao person, "There was once a Tang king who had several daughters. Among them, the second daughter was the most beautiful and virtuous, so the Tang king loved her especially. After a few years, these daughters grew up and married one after another. Only the second daughter remained by his side because the Tang king loved her.</p>
<p>Once, bandits invaded the territory, and the Tang king was defeated. He immediately packed up his property and led his family to flee overseas. However, due to the haste of departure, he forgot to bring out a national jade seal. From then on, the Tang king was depressed and unhappy all day long, and he was very distressed, always thinking about the jade seal. Later, one day, he met Yama, and he asked Yama to find a way to retrieve the jade seal, but Yama could not think of a way either. The two people were speechless and pondered silently for a long time. Later, he came up with an idea himself and told Yama, "I want to post a reward. If anyone can cross the sea and retrieve my jade seal, no matter what kind of person they are, or even if they are a pig or a dog, they can be matched with my daughter."</p>
<p>Yama did not say a word after hearing this, but just glanced at him sideways. Unexpectedly, a black dog that Yama had brought along heard his words and decided to retrieve the jade seal in order to marry that beautiful woman. Sure enough, after Yama led it back, it did not reveal a word. It went straight to the sea with a wooden stick several feet long in its mouth. It floated in the sea for a few days and spent a lot of effort before finally reaching the shore. When it looked up, it only saw that the old capital of the Tang king still housed many bandits. It thought to itself: this time, the jade seal can only be retrieved by wisdom, not by force. It first started by contacting similar creatures and building emotional connections. It followed them around all day long, and after a long time, their feelings gradually merged. The palace of the Tang king was also memorized in its stomach because they guided it.</p>
<p>One day, it invited several companions to go to the palace of the Tang king, wandering around secretly to find the place where the jade seal was stored. It offered food to its companions to eat when it encountered it. The general bandits treated it like an ordinary dog, and did not mind letting it walk around freely. Thus, until it got dark, it suddenly saw a strong light shining on a large table, illuminating the entire room. Its heart could not help but move, and it walked towards the light. When it reached the front, it saw that it was indeed the jade seal that the Tang king was thinking about. It was overjoyed for a moment, and secretly crouched under the table, holding its breath silently for several hours. When it looked around, it saw that the bandits were all asleep. It suddenly jumped onto the table, held the jade seal in its mouth, and quietly slipped out of the bandits' area.</p>
<p>A few days later, it safely crossed the sea and delivered the jade seal to the Tang king. The Tang king looked down and was immediately shocked speechless. At this time, Yama also came after hearing the news and congratulated the Tang king. However, the Tang king was filled with mixed feelings of joy and worry, and could not think of an idea for a while. Later, his second daughter heard the news and hurried over to relieve her father's pain, agreeing to the reward offered by her father in one breath.</p>
<p>After she married the black dog, the Tang king gave her a few acres of land and told her to plant trees to make a living. The black dog lay by her side during the day and slept with her like a couple at night. After a year, she actually gave birth to a child. The Tang king was overjoyed when he heard the news and sent people to send many axes and more than a hundred bundles of grain stalks (the Miao people bundle grain ears, each bundle weighing about three or four pounds) as gifts. From then on, they lived a carefree life more joyfully. However, good times do not last forever, and eventually it became their mockery! One day, suddenly many people brought a lot of hunting dogs to hunt on the mountain near their home. The sound of dogs barking echoed through the valleys. The black dog was deeply moved by the sound of the hunting dogs, and followed them to hunt on the mountain. Unexpectedly, when it walked to a steep cliff, it suddenly lost its footing and fell down. Coincidentally, a "Dou Fei Yao" tree grew in the middle of the cliff, and the black dog was hung on this tree stump.</p>
<p>The Tang king's second daughter knew that it was unlikely to return when it had left and that its misfortune was great. She had no way to find out where it was, and she was unspeakably sad. The Miao people in the nearby area heard the unfortunate news and felt sorry for her!</p>
<p>After the black dog died, due to her diligent operation, the family became more prosperous day by day, and her son grew up day by day. The mother and son lived a peaceful life. One day, the son remembered his father's tragic death, so he went to the valley where his father had "hunted" to find its remains. After working hard for a few days, he finally found a pair of bright red bones of his father in a tree stump in the cliff. This strange news immediately spread throughout the Miao people's villages. Everyone believed that these bones could not rot and that its son could make a fortune because of the spirituality of this "Dou Fei Yao" tree. Therefore, the general Miao people competed to risk their lives to cut down the tree and carry it back, hollow out the center of the tree, and put it on a rope, offering it like a god. Coincidentally, the year its son found its remains was exactly thirteen years old, so the general Miao people hold a "Drum-Pulling Festival" once every thirteen years.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this story is absurd and magical, but the motivation of the general Miao people to hold this meeting is still inseparable from the idea of "getting rich," just like the ideas held by civilized people!</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Question of Amateur Foreign Language Learning <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Jia</p>
<p>I remember that last year this newspaper published an article on the question of "whether to learn a foreign language in one's spare time." At that time, it was not ignored by me, a young shop assistant who lacked spare time but had a strong desire to read. Because there was more than one article published, and the opinions were different, it was quite difficult for me to adapt for a while. First of all, I accepted the editor's opinion and decided to read some basic knowledge books first, and abandon foreign languages. The results were good. However, when I seemed to have acquired some basic knowledge, I immediately realized that the knowledge I had acquired was too shallow and felt that future progress would be very slow. It should be stated that this is not because I am old and my mind is wandering. It is just that the subject I am studying is social science. Knowing some scientific theories without examples to illustrate them is like reading dead books. What is the use of accumulating without transforming? At that time, I turned around and wanted to learn a foreign language. I think English is more common. If I can read foreign magazines and newspapers, I can also know more about world affairs. I had encountered English in elementary school before, and I knew it was difficult. But when I thought of the saying that "the word 'difficult' only exists in the dictionary of fools," I was courageous and determined. From then on, I studied hard and kept chanting in my mouth. Unexpectedly, after half a year of study, no results were seen. At that time, I thought of learning Esperanto. However, some friends thought that I was "fickle" and that I would end up achieving nothing. But within three months, I actually made rapid progress. I think this should be attributed to the simplicity and ease of learning Esperanto. If it cannot enable me to achieve the goal of reading magazines and newspapers, it is possible to give up halfway.</p>
<p>In the past, I did not know such a small place as Saar. Later, I read a Saar newsletter in an Esperanto magazine and learned about its geographical location and its importance. When the Saar region voted.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>The content of the Saar issue was published in Chinese newspapers. At that time, it could only be regarded as old news for me. Recently, Chinese newspapers have published war news about Italy and Abyssinia for days, but I know it in more detail in the Esperanto newsletter. Regarding cultural news, such as when I saw in the Shen Bao and Da Wan Bao that "the 27th International Esperanto Congress will be held in Rome in August, and the Chinese Ministry of Education has sent a representative from the embassy in Italy to participate nearby, and Mussolini will serve as the temporary chairman at that time," this matter is related to world affairs, so please forgive me for knowing it long ago. Moreover, not only that, because the Chinese newspapers did not mention the grand event of traveling to Africa! All this proves that Esperanto news is well-informed, but what does it reveal to people?</p>
<p>The "difficulty" of English certainly makes people a "fool." Now, grasping a beautiful and easy-to-learn language will no longer allow me to be called "fickle" and "change my mind." If learning Esperanto is easy is "easy to do," and knowing that learning Esperanto is so easy is so useful is "difficult to know," I am willing to let everyone know this hard-won thing together.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Review of "City Scenery" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Mingyao</p>
<p>There is no question that "City Scenery" stands out from domestic films with a brand-new attitude. Not only does the choreography adopt new methods and techniques, but it also "uses music to describe the movements, psychological changes, and scene transitions of the characters in the play." It is a so-called "new type of musical drama" that creates a unique style.</p>
<p>Domestic sound films have made considerable progress, but due to their short history, they have only achieved achievements in dialogue or songs at most. There is no talk of "musical masterpieces," let alone "sound and shadow art"! However, film art must be urged to progress in order to describe the complex social environment and meet the needs of the audience. This time, the Diantong Company has created this new type of musical drama with an experimental attitude. This spirit of courage and effort is admirable.</p>
<p>Now, for the sake of clarity, I will briefly introduce the story as follows:</p>
<p>"At a small station in a certain village, farmers abandon their farm tools and flock to Shanghai. While waiting for the train, a person playing with a peep show (played by Yuan Muzhi) sings and solicits business. So, a family of four, father, mother, daughter, and nephew, go to watch. The peep show shows "City Scenery": Li Menghua (played by Tang Na), a young man in the city, is a penniless "unknown writer," but he is in love with Zhang Xiaoyun (played by Zhang Xinzhu), a fashionable lady who is not well-off but loves to dress up. Zhang also has a lover, Wang Junshan (played by Gu Menghe), a tea shop manager with some wealth who usually likes to play with women and pretends to be阔. The daughter's father (played by Zhou Boxun) is one of the shareholders of the pawnshop, and the family's finances are very tight, so he often asks the pawnshop for money, but the pawnshop's business is not good, so he is repeatedly rejected. In the end, he even takes the things pawned by others home to use for the New Year. Later, Li Menghua was defeated by money, and Xiaoyun was taken away by Junshan. However, because Junshan usually pretends to be wealthy, he spends a lot of money, and his business loses money. Before the end of the year, creditors come to the door to urge him to pay, so he abandons Xiaoyun and quietly flees. When Xiaoyun and her father find out and chase to the station, the train has already left. The "City Scenery" in the peep show ends here. The father, mother, daughter, and nephew who watched the peep show turn their heads and remember that they are rushing to Shanghai by train. At this time, two trains are about to leave separately, but they do not know what to do. As a result, both trains leave in their panic!"</p>
<p>The story is very simple, almost entirely love. In fact, it can be said that the whole play is a clue of several improper men and women entangled. Just because of the new techniques of description, it appears fresh and lively. In addition, the music helps to describe the movements and psychological changes of the characters in the play, making it feel more relaxed and cheerful. There is no question that "City Scenery" is a slapstick comedy. After watching it, you can indeed "laugh from beginning to end," but it is not like the "slapstick films" of the past that are fabricated, pretentious, and slapstick. It grabs reality as the theme and portrays it from the opposite side using a humorous satirical method. For example, the awkward appearance of the peep show player when he first appears evokes your laughter, but when he starts singing a business song in a hoarse voice, your "laughter" is stained with a sour tone. For example, the four people who watched the peep show showed a flustered attitude of pulling east and west when the train was about to leave, which made people laugh, but when they thought that these men and women had left the countryside and could not insert themselves into the sinful city, the situation of "not knowing what to do" made people feel a sour taste in their hearts!</p>
<p>The playwright gives the meaning of "City Scenery" to expose the sins and ugliness in the city. Therefore, there are charming vixen who sell wind and ride modernly (Zhang Xiaoyun), young evil people in foreign venues who play with women and pretend to be rich (Wang Junshan), flatterers and lackeys (Wang Junshan's secretary, Secretary Chen), and intellectual youths who do not seek progress and regard love as the supreme doctrine (Li Menghua...). These types of people are common in the city. The playwright grabs these types of people and makes powerful satire and ridicule. Therefore, "love supremacists" are eventually kicked away by others, "empty shele builders" eventually collapse, and fashionable ladies who envy vanity end up in a desolate situation. Among them, the "love supremacists" are especially subjected to harsh ridicule: Li Menghua, a poor writer with no reputation and no money, does not seek progress from the road he takes, but insists on love as a routine, and also pursues a vain modern woman. Therefore, there are various embarrassing situations such as owing rent to buy decorations for his lover, pawning his watch into the dance hall, and mistakenly giving the pawn ticket as a admission ticket. It is really full of jokes and ugly appearances. This divine satire is justified, and Chu is very reasonable.</p>
<p>These are all the sins and ugliness of the city, but its appearance is very impressive, just like the peep show cannot be debunked. The playwright uses this "peep show" to see through the various forms in the "City Scenery." The use of techniques can be said to be very flexible. When the eyes of the four people waiting for the train come into contact with the peep show, the towering buildings in the city, the roaring cars, ... all clearly slip past their eyes, as if it is a very grand and lively paradise. However, the last contact is the cave of sin. All the ugly people are active there, so the fantasy of the city is lost.</p>
<p>The entire plot is very tight, and it can consistently grasp the emotions of the audience. From beginning to end, they want to laugh, want to laugh, smile, and laugh loudly. At the same time, because of the music that is arranged to suit the plot, it adds a lot of power. This is where the "new type of musical drama" is superior to other "slapstick films" or "popular films."</p>
<p>However, "City Scenery" cannot be considered a completely successful work. We must know that the ugliness in the city cannot be represented by those few small clowns. The playwright only takes these few small characters to ridicule as much as possible, and ignores the big sins and the people who create sins. Even the petty officials (Wang Junshan), lackeys (Secretary Chen), and vixen (Zhang Xiaoyun) among those few small characters are lightly let go, and the poor writers are regarded as the main targets of ridicule. It has to be said that the playwright's eyes only see the small things, and let go of the big aspects. At the same time, the father, mother, daughter, and nephew who watch the peep show are the father, mother, and daughter in the "City Scenery" shown in the mirror, but the nephew becomes the "love supremacist" Li Menghua. I don't know why one person has to play two roles? If the playwright's intention is to imply that the types of people in "City Scenery" are the faces of the peep show watchers in the city, then that is a mistake. Because these farmers who "abandon their farm tools" always have unavoidable hardships before they leave the countryside and wander to the city. No matter how the urban environment changes their lives and temperaments, they are not qualified to be "vixens" or "love supremacists"... On the contrary, they have to desperately pursue work and struggle and groan painfully on the lifeline!</p>
<p>In addition to the distortion of the theme, the arrangement of actors is not very appropriate. Zhang Xinzhu, as the heroine, seems to have nothing to commend. Her expressions and movements are very stiff, and her lines are not very proficient. Originally, she should have many places to "act." As a woman who admires vanity, she has to deal with two lovers, please her parents, and also plan for her own expenses. She needs a lively posture, smooth communication, gentle movements, and flirtatious expressions to suit her situation. However, she has not exerted these kinds of personality abilities! Tang Na, as the male lead, is also very ordinary. A "love supremacist" should show a very enthusiastic attitude towards his lover, and especially show extreme regret and even cry and go crazy after losing love, but Tang Na did not do this. Although the sad performance can destroy the atmosphere of the comedy, crying can also add to the laughter! What is worth praising is Gu Menghe and Lan Ping. They are very competent for the roles they play. Their expressions and movements are also very realistic and not forced. It is a pity that they have too few opportunities to "act." If they were changed into the main characters, they might add a lot of color to the whole play!</p>
<p>In short, "City Scenery" has many shortcomings, but it cannot hide its advantages. Its new appearance is worth seeing.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Introduction to "Life Knowledge" <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Bao</p>
<p>— Priced at eight cents per copy, sold by the Public Magazine Company —</p>
<p>Amidst the clamor of "Magazine Year," "Tabloid Year," and "Economic Downturn," we have unfortunately witnessed the cessation of many good magazines (such as the renovated "Modern," and "Translation"...), but at the same time, many new publications have appeared before our eyes. This not only demonstrates the arduous struggle of those generally dedicated to the cultural movement, but also reveals the general public's urgent demand for new knowledge.</p>
<p>"Life Knowledge" is one such noteworthy publication among the many newly released. In its "Publishing Declaration," this publication, after stating the objective circumstances of its emergence, made the following self-description:</p>
<p>"Precisely because our publication is passively called forth by objective circumstances, we must, in accordance with objective circumstances, automatically establish a clear goal for our publication from a subjective perspective. The goal of our publication, as indicated by its name, is life knowledge. But not the knowledge that natural persons living at any time and in any place should possess, but rather the knowledge specific to modern Chinese society, where the national territory is being lost, the countryside is bankrupt, and 'natural disasters' are exacerbated by man-made calamities."</p>
<p>We have            to say that the content of the publication is consistent with the stated goal in its "Publishing Declaration," although some aspects still do not entirely satisfy individuals.</p>
<p>Judging by the inaugural issue, "Life Knowledge" is a small, comprehensive cultural magazine. It contains writings on economics, politics, science, philosophy, and literature and art, all of which can generally be said to be written under the "goal" proposed in its "Publishing Declaration." Now, for the sake of clarity for readers, we will provide a brief introduction to the content of each section—</p>
<p>Regarding economic analysis, the inaugural issue contains two articles: Xu Xingjun's "The General Trend of the Modern World Economy" and Chu Xinjun's "What is Rose Doing in China?" The former first points out that the combination of monopoly and competition is the "root of the modern world's economic chaos"; then, based on this, it explains the emergence of "consolidation policies" and "tariff wars and currency wars" in foreign trade, resulting in the form of "economic nationalism"; subsequently, it further points out several new phenomena exhibited by the modern world economy under the prevalence of "economic nationalism": the disintegration of the international market, the reduction of the international division of labor, the increase of state intervention in economic life, and the lack of signs of a resolution to the chronic mass unemployment phenomenon. Finally, it points out the desire of various capitalist countries to use war as a way out of the world economic chaos. In a short article of four or five thousand words, the actual situation of the current world economy is clearly presented, which is the main feature of this article. The latter—"What is Rose Doing in China?"—explains the conflicts between Britain, Japan, and the United States in China from the perspective of Rose's visit to China. This is an article most closely related to our real life and is worth reading.</p>
<p>There are also two articles on international politics. The first is He Dui's "The Italian-Abyssinian War—Imperialist War—Peace," in which the author, based on recent facts, points out the reality of imperialist powers carving up Abyssinia and oppressing weak nations, and, based on the actual situation in Italy and the conflict between Britain and Italy, explains the causes of the East African issue. Finally, it concludes that in the conflict of imperialism, all weak nations must rise up "to resolve the conflicts between imperialists by resolving their own suffering." The second is Ling Junjun's "Several Prospects Estimated for the Italian-Abyssinian Conflict." Judging from the current situation, although the author's estimates seem to be somewhat inconsistent with the facts, there are also some noteworthy opinions in his analysis.</p>
<p>In the philosophy section, Si Qi's "The Key Points of Idealism" is a popular and concise article. Here, the author provides a brief explanation of the cosmology, ontology, epistemology, and methodology of idealistic philosophy. General beginners in philosophy can obtain a brief systematic concept of idealism after reading it.</p>
<p>The two articles in the science section are both very interesting and meaningful. "The Story of Inventions" is a translation, which tells the story of an invention related to extinguishing a major fire triggered by an oil well fire, and discusses many things about inventions. Although this article is not yet finished, we can already understand the meaning of the so-called "collective inventors" in the Soviet Union and some principles of natural science after reading the already published part. The next is Shu Qian's "Starting from the Relationship between Mathematics and Our Lives," which seems like a rigid article, but because the author explains the problem based on actual life and finds simple examples from actual life to illustrate the relationship between mathematics and life, reading it not only does not feel "rigid," but also feels very interesting.</p>
<p>"Life Knowledge" gives more importance to literature and art. But strictly speaking, some of the writings on literature and art published in the inaugural issue cannot compare with the articles in other sections. First, such as Guan Lu's novel "Bankruptcy," although it writes about a real phenomenon of the current Chinese society in the decline of industry and commerce, the author's artistic expression is very inadequate, thus making people feel that this is not an artistically depicted novel, but a simple narration of a story. Second, Zhou Gangming's "How to Read Novels," although this article is not yet finished, we feel that if the unpublished part of this article is consistent with</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>the published part, and written under the author's theoretical and writing skills, then this will be a relatively ordinary article lacking brilliance. Although what the author is talking about here is not theoretically problematic, it is just some empty theoretical principles that almost everyone knows, so it makes people feel that it lacks practical content and profound theory. I think the current readers have made some progress. They are already familiar with theoretical principles such as "literature is a social phenomenon" and "literature reflects social life." Therefore, our current responsibility is not to talk to them about theoretical principles in an empty way, but to actually apply the principles, develop the principles, and make our theory profound, substantial, and useful, so as not to become ordinary. Naturally, being popular is necessary, but wouldn't it be better if we could express profound theories in a popular form using practical materials and a lively and generous writing style? If being popular leads to being ordinary, isn't it as bad as not being popular? We hope that the editors and authors of "Life Knowledge" will pay special attention to this. In addition, Li Sheng's "About Mona Lisa," Zhang Geng's "Drama Lectures for the Audience," and Hou Mo's "Peach Blossom Fan" review are all works worth reading.</p>
<p>"Life Knowledge" still talks less about the general social phenomena currently occurring, thus reducing its realistic activeness. I think "Life Knowledge" should add a column dedicated to discussing the noteworthy social phenomena of reality, such as the "Social Phase" of "Reading Life" and the "Lookout" of "World Knowledge" (talking about international events). At the same time, although "Life Knowledge" has already achieved the popularity and mass appeal of the writing, we still hope that it will make more efforts in the depth of theory and the richness of content. Also, there are too many typos in this issue, and we hope that you will pay attention to proofreading in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Scattered Notes While Sick <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ping</p>
<p>A body that was originally weak from birth has been placed in a job that requires a strong physique to deal with on a daily basis. Therefore, illness has become entangled with me.</p>
<p>In fact, it is just a minor illness, but it has caused me to be bedridden; my waist and limbs are sore, my head hurts in waves, and a slight breeze will make my whole body tremble. Everyone says, "Get a good night's sleep, sweat a lot, and you will be refreshed tomorrow." I thought so too, so I slept well in bed.</p>
<p>Sweat seeped out of my pores, and I was overjoyed. Afterwards, sweat poured out from all parts of my body like a flood. The sweat beads on my forehead were as large as beans. The smell of sweat wafted from the quilt into my nostrils in waves. It was really unbearably smelly. After enduring for some time, the quilt was almost like a damp bucket during the plum rain season. I really couldn't bear it anymore. I thought: Sweating this much is probably enough, so I boldly loosened the quilt.</p>
<p>Because I mostly drank boiled water, although I sweated, I still had to urinate, and it seemed that my bowel movement at 7 pm every night was also on time, so I wanted to go to the latrine. I am a single person and have always lived in the school dormitory. Because I live in the school, I have to abide by the various rules that general students must abide by. I can usually live this mechanical life, but I often suffer when I am sick, such as having a bowel movement, whether you are sick or not, you have to walk across a large square to get to the latrine. Because I was afraid of catching a cold while I was sick, I wrapped my whole body in a thick blanket. As soon as I staggered out of the dormitory, a cold wind hit me in the face, making me shiver all over. When I got to the latrine, I was dizzy and the world was spinning. It was hard to finish it in a daze and walk across the square back to the dormitory.</p>
<p>When I went back to bed, the residual warmth in the quilt was still there, which was much more comfortable. However, this night's sleep was really the most painful. I woke up in a fright from time to time in my dream, which was a very uncomfortable awakening.</p>
<p>I woke up earlier than usual the next day. I looked at the skylight and felt too uncomfortable to sleep in bed. I always thought that my minor illness must have been cured after a night's sleep, so I got dressed and washed up, but my head was swollen and painful, even more so than yesterday afternoon. I still went to class and asked the students to write compositions. I sat at the table and watched them carefully conceive their ideas. The dizziness in my head became even worse. I thought about letting them write their compositions well, and I could go back to the dormitory and lie down for a while. But then I thought, it's still not good, wouldn't it be boring to lie in the dormitory alone? And maybe if I don't accompany them, they will just do it sloppily and perfunctorily. Okay, let's just endure it!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I still lay in bed, sweating large beads in the quilt, and fell asleep several times, half awake and half drowsy. I began to feel anxious: Could it turn into a serious illness?</p>
<p>Eating porridge had no taste, so I asked the tea room to send a can of corned beef from under the bed to the kitchen to steam and eat. Eating it also had no taste. After eating three pieces, my stomach inexplicably became uncomfortable after sleeping for a while. Finally, I vomited it out, and the strands of meat were still strands of meat.</p>
<p>At this time, I was hoping that there was some magical medicine that could immediately cure my illness. I didn't bother to worry about the pain of being sick, but I couldn't do many things that needed to be done urgently, and I couldn't meet friends who needed to be met urgently. Anxious, anxious, I have always been an impatient person, and I am even more anxious when I am sick.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu advised me to buy Tiger Balm and apply it to my temples. I did as he said. Mr. × advised me to eat pears, so I bought them and ate them too. Later, the school doctor said that I had caught a cold and it would be good to take some medicine. He poured out a dozen gray, round and flat pills from the medicine bottle. He said to take one every four hours. I didn't see clearly what the medicine was, so I took it and left.</p>
<p>However, the illness did not ease. My forehead was burning like fire, and my head was still dizzy. Some people said that pears were too cold in nature, and some people said that the pills could not be eaten. I became even more flustered. I still have many things to do urgently, and several friends have entrusted me to do things!</p>
<p>When I am usually too busy with work, I often think: "It would be a pleasure in life to have a minor illness and steal half a day of leisure." Now that I am really sick, I know that "being free from illness is light."</p>
<p>I also often think that people have lived enough, and it would be so pleasant to have a great liberation once. Now I know that even a minor illness of one or two days will make it impossible to deal with public and private affairs. What about the so-called great liberation? Coming to this world, life is truly only suffering!</p>
<p>I wanted to go out to find a doctor for treatment, but it happened to be Sunday, and most doctors stopped seeing patients. If I wanted to make a special appointment, my illness didn't seem that serious, so I had to spend this day in endurance.</p>
<p>On Sundays, the dormitory is almost deserted, and I feel like I am in a dead city. It was hard to wait from dawn to dusk. The lonely Sunday finally passed in unbearable endurance.</p>
<p>That night, I sweated again, and my whole body seemed much lighter.</p>
<p>The next day (Monday), I asked the school for a day off and went to see a doctor at about ten o'clock. I have always been reluctant to ask people for leave. Even if I am sick, I will never ask for leave if I can barely support myself; it was the same when I was a student. I remember that I had also received a commendation for "diligence in study and never giving up" for four semesters in senior elementary school. One semester, because I occasionally suffered from a minor illness, the teachers repeatedly urged me to ask for leave, but I finally gave up the honor of being diligent in study and never gave up and still kept that commendation.</p>
<p>I entered the doctor's office. The doctor slightly took my pulse, looked at my tongue coating, and asked me a few questions. He picked up a pen and wrote: "External invasion of wind evil accompanied by dampness stagnation, body heat, body cold, headache, bone pain, thin greasy tongue, slippery and rapid pulse, it is appropriate to dispel evil and transform dampness." He also prescribed several medicines, and the matter was over.</p>
<p>At a little after one o'clock, the pharmacy had already sent the decocted medicine. The first and second decoctions were packed separately in small thermos bottles. The taste of the medicine was so bitter, but I had to open my throat wide and pour it straight down. Once, I almost vomited it out, but I finally stopped it with the greatest suppression and did not actually vomit.</p>
<p>It only takes three or four days to cure a minor illness. On the fifth day, I thought my illness was cured, so I dressed and got up in a grand manner, and went to the latrine and dining hall as usual. However, when I urinated in the latrine, the color of the urine was as red as eggplant skin wine, which was a bit scary. When I went to the dining hall to eat, I only had half a bowl of rice. People said that I had lost a lot of weight after four days of illness. I also felt a bit that way myself. When I stood on the scale, I weighed only 104 pounds, whereas I was originally a thin body of 108 pounds. Although it was not as pitiful as "people are thinner than yellow flowers," it did make me feel that my body was too unusable. Fortunately, my heart has gradually aged over the years, and that ambition no longer needs this flimsy body.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Overseas Chinese Around the World (End) <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>However, among these three reasons, the most important is the last one. Because if our national power is strong, even if people in various places are jealous of overseas Chinese and want to exclude them, they will not dare to deal with them casually. We see that there are many expatriates from countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Italy in various parts of the world, right? Isn't their power great in some places? But they have never been excluded or oppressed by others. Needless to say, the reason is that their countries are rich and strong, and others do not dare to deal with them casually.</p>
<p>Therefore, if our overseas Chinese affairs are to develop in the future, and if our more than 10 million overseas Chinese compatriots are to have a bright future, we can only strive to rescue our country from the state of semi-colonialism and keep pace with the advanced countries in the world. Only when our international status is improved can the status of our overseas Chinese in various parts of the world be raised, and they will not be unreasonably oppressed and excluded. If we cannot get rid of the title of weak nation, then overseas Chinese will be inferior to Jews in the world and will be oppressed everywhere.</p>
<p>Now, not to mention Britain and the United States, even black people in Africa and the Americas, and even equally weak nations such as Siam and Annam, will also arbitrarily bully our overseas Chinese compatriots. Chinese people and even Chinese goods in the world seem to be very problematic. Even eggs recently shipped to Britain have been described as bad eggs! In such a situation, if we do not strive to rescue the country and rescue the nation, not only will overseas Chinese not be able to gain a foothold in the world in the future, but even our country and nation will soon be unable to survive!</p>
