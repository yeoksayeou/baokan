<h3 id="c43">保障事務官之先决條件廷· <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>最近國民政府准考試院之呈請。訓令直轄各機關。略謂事務官應不隨政務官同進退。而經甄别合格之公務員。亦不得無故免職俾能安心奉公。增進行政效率。除令立法院起草公務員保障法外。着一體遵照云云。吾人常覺我國吏治之窳敗。由於公務員之遴選草率者半。由於陟黜失當者亦半。故幸而有權貴之奥援。可以平地靑雲。扶摇直上。不然則縱有奇才。亦多局促轅下。未能一展驥足。甚或隨時有淘汰之虞。影響所及。一般高職人員多抱五日京兆之心。不肖者。且以爲獵官固難戀棧亦正匪易。曷不乘此在職機會。盡量搜索。以爲下台以後捲土重來之計。而職位較次之事務人員。又各以長官之進退爲轉移。個人旣絶無生活之保障。焉能鼓起其矢忠於職務之興趣。國民政府有鑒於此。早曾於十七年三月一日通令全國云。「近查各機關往往因政務官更動。而事務官亦紛紛隨之更動不特遠大計劃。莫由實行。卽日常事務亦往往因之停頓。嗣後事務官不應隨政務官而更易」。又二十年三月六日通令云。「各機關對於甄别合格之現任公務員。不得任意更動。無故撤換。此爲注重銓衡杜絶倖進起見。各機關如果有因减縮事務或變更組織而須裁員者。亦應分别各員成績之優劣。資格之淺深。任職之久暫以爲去留之標凖。」此二通令。誠能雷厲風行。則現代考詮制度之基礎。早可奠定其半。今在事實上旣有重申前令之必要。自不可不有更進一步力求貫撤之决心也</p>
<p>今後由立法院擬訂之公務員保障法。内容如何。吾人固無從懸猜。特吾人以爲今日事務官所以無充分之保障。最大癥結。厥因事實上祇有消極的禁止任意更換公務員之法令。而並無積極的懲式非法任用私人或排除異己之明文也。故政府誠欲力矯積弊。第一應對此種非法行動予以懲戒而後可。據中央政治會議第一九八次會議。及第三屆中央執行委員第三次全體會議議决。凡須經政治會議或國務會議議决任命之官吏皆爲政務官。此外之</p>
<p>委任薦任簡任人員。卽爲事務官。事務官之罷免或其他懲戒處分。應嚴格遵照公務員懲戒法第二條第十五條行之。卽事務官非因（一）違法·（二）廢弛職務或其他失職行爲。則不受免職降級等之處分。而懲戒機關又應將原送彈劾文件抄交被付懲戒之事務官。並指定期間命其提出申辯書。於必要時並得命其到塲質詢是也。今後政務官有不依此法令及其規定程序。任意剝奪其屬下事務官之官職或减削其等級俸給者。自身卽爲非法。監察院應卽提出彈劾案及證據。視其身份。送交中央黨部監察委員會或國民政府實行懲戒。夫而後事務官之地位得有充分之保障。而行政效率亦可有長足之進展也。墨索里尼·賴伐爾議定中歐公約</p>

<p>羅馬法外長賴伐爾與意首相墨索里尼今日在此會談後、己訂定中歐公約、其中規定、遇有任何國干涉奥國之獨立時、法意兩國將彼此商榷、並將邀請毘連奥境之各國、連德國在内、簽字於一種不干涉之議定書、法意兩國間條約之全文並議請羅馬尼亞與波蘭兩國參加不干涉之議定書、兩國與其他毘連奥境之各國應互允不干涉彼此之内政、不發起任何侵略行動、及不輔助任何恐怖團之活動、該約全文經法意當　贊同後、卽通告德政府、衆料壯請德國於最近之將來參加中歐公約、聞英國難甚願贊助最後之解决、如外相西門所發好意電文所表示者、但似不致加入公約、</p>
<p>法外長與意首相作第一次談話後、午後五時復與意國副相蘇維志在旅館中會談、法外長曾語往訪之新聞家、謂各事方在順利進行中、今晨與墨索里尼之談話曾涉及條約中之一切云、</p>
<p>法意當軸今須解决之主要困難、其一爲如何商諸德政府、及至何程度始應申請德國參加不干涉議定書、另一困難、則爲法意阿三國揉合之利益、自意阿兩國發生烏魯爾之爭案後、此事殊形棘手、但今日意王曾向阿國代使聲明意國友好之意志、及願對於烏魯爾爭案作和平之諒解、此事局勢己因以大有進步矣、</p>
<p>據柏林路透電訊、官塲對於法意兩國所商定之公約、不輕發言論、惟政府發言人對不干涉奥國獨立一節、曾謂今己有許多國切實聲明决計保障奥國之獨立、此種公約似反可减弱而不能增固各國宣言之重要、且足引起英國置身公約以外之印象、該發言人關於不干涉之共同公約之建議、又稱、柏林以爲此笙涉及奥國之公文、就德國而論、殊覺發之太遲矣、蓋德國固嘗竭力避免干涉奥國一類之任何事件也云云、</p>
<p>法外長今日赴維尼齊亞宮參與墨索里尼之宴會時、曾卽席演說、謂和平今仍處於危險中、惟吾人己具偉大之希望、而不應灰心、法國自當關心其本國之安全、而亦知如何參加融和各國意見之事務、意相墨索里尼則嘗於意大利新時代歷史中著警告人類、不得任令人道退入黑暗時代、此爲許多國家所明白者云云、意相墨索里尼繼起宣稱、意法兩國今不特恊力經營雙方之恊約、且將發揚光大兩國受諸同源之主義、意法兩國非謀否認中歐各國彼此之友誼、而實圖調和各國之利益與需要、同趨於和平之一途、末稱、今並無排拒任何國之問題云、當聚宴時、法外長曾以大十字榮譽章贈與意相、意相亦以聖茅里圖斯與拉蘇魯斯大十字章贈與法外長、法外長並於今日午後六時三十分參與法大使署之歡迎會、（五日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c71">一年來日本貿易的觀察（日本通信） <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>自一九三四年一月起至同年十二月中旬止、日本的貿易、輸出總値、二十萬八千一百二十五萬五千元、輸入總値二十一萬七千六百七十萬五千元、輸出方面比上年同時期多二萬九千一百四十五萬元、輸入比去年同期多三萬三千五百二十一萬元、到一九三四年年底爲止、日本貿易總額、恐怕會要超過四十二萬萬元、也未可知、就産業上商務上講、這種情形、眞可以說是近五年以來所未有的新記錄、因此有大部分的産業家商業家、是非常樂觀、以爲日本經濟前途、是很有發展的希望、</p>
<p>但是在這樣輸出盛旺的情勢下、却有一種悲觀的暗影、卽是生絲輸出總値、上年一月至十二月中旬止、計三萬九千一百萬元、今年同期祗値二萬六千七百萬元、在輸出總數百分比率上、也由百分之二一·七五、跌至百分之一三·二五、這不單是商品的興衰關係而己、且於日本産業界亦有深切關聯、在她整個國民經濟上、也發生很大的影響、特别是農村、本州各地賴以撑支潤澤的、差不多以蠶絲爲主、並且日本的租稅收入、從農村及農村副業如絲業等類收來的、超過租稅總額的三分之一、蠶絲如從此慢性衰頽、受困的恐怕不止一部分的農村而己、惟在另一方面、她的輕工業、依然繼續向上發逹、棉織品合棉布·莫大小·棉紗·三種輸出、計價値五萬二千六百萬元日金、是輸出的最大宗、也是她爭取市塲最有效的武器、</p>
<p>在輸入方面、棉花比上年增加了一千五百萬元、羊毛增加九百萬元、這兩項輸入增加、表示她於棉毛織品工業有飛躍的發展、並且象徵着將來要和英國不僅爭取棉織品市塲、還要爭毛織品市塲、不過眼前却在政治上占一點便家宜、就是大宗的輸入澳洲羊毛、緩和了澳洲對日的惡感、使英日之間、因而多接近一點、</p>
<p>此外更値得注意的、是鐵的輸入、增加了一千七百萬元、機械輸入、增加三千八百萬元、石油的輸入、增加九百萬元、這些東西的增加、和棉花羊毛的情形大不相同、並不是工業製造的關係、而是軍需工業突飛猛進的現象、由她的軍需工業暢旺、我們可以推知其中所包含的危險性爲何如、所謂維持和平有多大的實在性、也能從此窺知了、</p>
<p>輸出貿易總數量上、今年比上年增加了百分之十六、除對美國以外、大體都傾向於增加、但是今後何如呢、據日本經濟界觀測、以爲現在己經逹到飽和點、不敢輕於作無條件的樂觀、他們都相當的加意警戒、</p>
<p>日本對外貿易、旣然這樣發展、而世界市塲、有一定限制、其他的國家、尤其是英美、當然要受打擊、所以她們都興築起政治的壁障、以從事於對抗、例如英國於一九三三年、在西阿非利加廢止了對日通商條約、印度對日本棉織品的輸入、也特别加以限制、於其他英國所屬殖民地、也實施外國製織品輸入的限額制度、不消說、這事情的目標、是在對付日本、美國於本年八月間、與古巴締結新通商條約、規定美國電燈泡比其他國家所製有優先權、也是抵制日本的、</p>
<p>日本自實行貨幣减値以來、在國際匯兌市塲上占優勢、英美勢難再拱手旁觀下去、今後或者訂立通貨恊定、以圖一時的</p>
<p>緩和、或者重新建立政治壁障、以與日本商品相對抗、又如「满洲」的石專賣法、隱含着軍事意味、同時限制英美石油的輸入、英國對此、曾提抗議、但是日本却祗推謝、這在最近的將來、難免不演成</p>
<p>重大的問題、卽令暫時用什麽方法沉默下去、終久會惹起事端的、因爲這不單是石油關係、裹面還隱藏着軍備競爭呢、（十二月二十九目）</p>

<p>現在己是中華民國二十四年、就是我們國家己經長成到了二十四歲、就普通一個人來講、到了二十四歲、己經是學業完成、自己一定能够自强自立、正所謂年富力强的時候、我們國家也是如此、到了二十四歲、應該己經長大成爲一個年富力强的新國家、能够自强自立奮發有爲、所以在今天二十四元旦、大家要趁此歲序更新的很好的機會、立志奮發、努力自强、不僅省府主席省府委員要精神一新、並且全體同志全體同胞都要及時奮發精神一新、去年兄北發起的新生活運動、就是要使全國國民都能滌除舊汚刷新精神、以復興我民族而建設現代的國家、自發起以來、浙江各同志都很熱心倡導、此次兄弟到了杭州、並承促進會邀請</p>

<p>指導、現在就藉今天的機會、告訴各位同志、去年是新生活運動的倡導試行的時期、計算起來、差不多己經過了一年、今年民國二十四年我們要大家約定爲澈底實行新生活的一年、從今天元旦起、大家要立志革故鼎新、將過去生活上·社會上·政治上·以及各方面一切的缺點統統澈底革除、我們一切的思想·言論·行動·都要照着新生活運動的道理從新更始、不僅形式上要能够刷新、尤要在精神上做到表裹如一、務使一切眞能合乎「禮義廉恥」、如此、才可以使我們的政治·社會以及整個的國家能够有新的氣象、發生新的精神、也必須如此、才可以完成我們革命的事業、兄弟今天在元旦的時候和大家如此約定、請黃主席領導我們全省的同志同胞、照這個意思去努力、務必建設</p>
<p>一個澈底實行新生活的新浙江、由此推而廣之來建設眞正的新中華民國、其次、剛才中央監誓委員己經說過、浙江省有很多應該興辦的事情、和應當革除的弊病、尤其是去年浙江受了很重的旱災、多數民衆困苦顛連、鄕村經濟困窮疲敞、亟待各位省府委員和一般同志以愷悌惻怛之心共同努力來設法救濟、當前我們所要辦的事情極多、不是一下子統統可以辦得了、但是總理說有志竟成、只要我們肯研究能努力、没有一個人不可以教好、没有一件東西不可以爲國家爲人民而利用、也没有一件事情不能成功、而最要緊的一個條件、就是要我們有精神、能照兄弟所常講的「實幹、快幹、硬幹、」的精神去力行、能够眞正照着古人所說「公爾忘私、國爾忘家」兩句格言來努力、故去一般的弊病、不是敬且偸安、得過且過、就是虚與委蛇、不重實際、凡事重私輕公、只知有己、不知有人、更不知有國家民族、因此、無論政治上、社會上、以及各方面永遠没有進步、而眞正新的國家、始終還没有建設起來、我們浙江的民衆、論天賦能力本不後人、但是苟安自私、因循散漫、亦屬不可爲諱、從今以後、無論是在黨務上、政治上、教育上、社會上負責的各位同志、尤其是今天在塲的各位領袖、務必本着大公無私實事求是的精神來做事、照兄弟剛才講的意思、身體力行、倡導民衆、澈底改革過去一切敷衍苟且、重私輕公的風氣、從省政府直到各縣地方、無論何事、總要做一分有一分的實效、使民力不致虚糜、時問不致浪費、如此、方可以建設新的政治、立定革命的基礎、完成革命的使命、</p>
<p>但是我們要確定逹到這個目的、眞正建立一個可作全國模範的新浙江、還有一個政治上的基本原則、不可忘記、就是一切的專權、都要統一集中、切忌散漫分割、也不可繁而寡要、從前一切不統一不集中的弊病、統統要澈底改過、從今以後、全省的同志同胞大家要同心同德一心一意擁護政府、擁護主席來努力中央和全省民衆所期望於省政府做到的一切事情、以完成新浙江的建設、卽以盡到各位同志和地方民衆所應盡的責任、</p>
<p>今天是民國二十四年元旦、從今天開始、我們大家必須以二十四分的努力以求二十四分的成功、而满足國家和民衆二十四分的期望、現在我們的工作很重要、機會也己經到了、只要大家一致努力、一定可以有很大的成功、可以满足大家的希望、這就是今天兄弟所要貢獻的幾句話、恭祝諸位健康和成功、」</p>

<p>（濟南通信）本市齊魯大學自去年開董事會議後、聘梅貽寳爲校長、梅未到前暫推副董事長李植藩代理校長、李因董事長孔祥熙未允就職、故對代校長一事、亦在考慮中、遲遲又久、校務仍無人負責、最近該校董事朱友如由京過濟赴平、據云、孔己可以就任董事長、故李亦允担任校長職務、學生對李表示歡迎、四日上課、齊大風潮己告一結束、四日李植藩赴教廳、報告代理校長始末、與將來之方針、請教廳予以指導、并請示省府每年恊助該校五千元如何領取、當由廳長何思源、秘書主任王近信接見、談話大意如下、（一）鞏固學校基礎、李謂、齊大經費五十萬元、均係由外國教會担任捐助而來、但捐助性質、仍恐不能長久、設一旦中斷、校務即有停頓之虞、關於鞏固學校基礎一點、頗關重要、擬將來先入乎組織校友會、齊大歷年畢業者逹一千餘人、散處各地、欲使其有組織、維護母校、推定負責委員、倘每人每年最低担任五十元、則可有五萬元之數、不無小補、再有本校建設委員會、亦决定將董事會健全起來、董事人數不使過多、限定十五人、照部章推中國人十個、外國人五個、負責辦本校事、以免散漫不整、</p>
<p>（二）學校到農村去、現在政府教育方法、注重農村、一班與論亦均如此、再則担任齊大經費之外國教會、每年兩次開會、最近亦以每年出五六十萬鉅欵、辦一普通大學無大意義、主張使學校到農村去、有此種種關係、齊大將來方針即照此趨向、但絶無將文理院改鄕村師範之議學生因聞此謡傳、頓起不安、屢向校方質問、校方己有切實聲明、將來學校方針注重農村、但絶無改文理院爲鄕師之事、</p>
<p>（三）彌補學校虧空在校長梅貽寳未到校前、李代校長之期爲半年、計算至今年六月二十三年度終了止、學校虧空約四萬元之數、此數幸不甚多、似不成問題、且齊大建設委員會亦議定對學校經濟設法輔助、籌募四萬元或不甚難也、</p>
<p>（四）文理院長問題、李允就代理校長職後、曾函校長梅貽寳報告、梅己覆函、謂所担任太谷銘賢校長事、最近董事會開會擬即提出辭職、暑假或可來濟、現在惟文理院長林濟靑頗成問題、李代校長甚希望林仍回校任職、學生亦電林歡迎、惟林尙無表示、林任文理院長有五年合同、至去年三月業己屆满、如挽林回職、必須另定五年合同、但李代理校長爲期仍半年、未敢聘五年任期之文理院長、故函梅貽寳商洽、現在尙未有覆函、大概校方可以照聘、林允就與否尙不敢預定云云、教廳電部報告、教育廳以該校文理院學生業己上課、校長亦有人負責、特電教部報告經過、又李植藩四日午後在該校召集文理醫三院、全體教職員會議、討論進行方針云、</p>

<p>二時開會、主席陶委員百川、招待喩仲標·王龍章等、首由主席報告、略謂市黨部主持之高中優秀學生聯誼運動、今日爲第三次、第四次聯誼運動、因考試問題、本學期己無法舉行、第四次原定參觀市政府、憑弔吳淞戰區、如各同學願意參加、俟下學期招待高中一年級優秀生時、一併舉行、今日爲討論會、會前有一簡單之測騐、問題中有屬於思想的、有屬於智識的、很可作爲教育之參考、今日討論會、因時間問題、演講停止、先由同學發表問題、再由導師解答云云、</p>
<h3 id="c222">升學與讀書 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>第一組爲升學與讀書、</p>
<p>討論問題爲如何使淸寒學生升學案、先由學生共同討論、繼由導師邰爽秋發表意見、略謂個人感想、凡靑年將來向國家社會有所貢獻、升學固然需要、不升學其實也可以、所謂升學者未必讀書、讀書者未必升學、如美國之安迪生、中國商務印書館之王雲五、何嘗升學、即其一例、故無錢即不能讀書之觀念、有志靑年應該糾正過來、但如何使經濟困難之靑年得以升學、應從政府社會教育等多方面之努力、至其方法、（一）互助升學、（二）補助升學、最後希望諸位不要灰心、同時更希望不要以爲不升學即不能讀書云、</p>
<h3 id="c223">就業與服務 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>第二組爲就業與服務、</p>
<p>討論問題爲如何使中學生畢業後得到相當職業、由導師楊衛玉發表意見、略謂就業與服務一組、共有二十九個問題、但相同很多、講到這個問題、先要聲明、蓋無論任何問題的解决辦法、第一要有科學的、或教育的原理、第二有科學的或政治的、或教育的力量、但我們今天討論、旣無原理、又無力量、故不能絶對的解决、上面這個問題、不但爲全社會的問題、亦是整個民族出路問題、如整個民族出路有解决、則中學生職業問題、不難解决、至於謀職業、第一我們要找職業、不一定靠人、（二）找職業不能有虚榮心、（三）惟努力能得到最後的成功、最要緊的、在需要找職業而職業找不到的時候、切不可灰心·從努力·機會·時間的方式中求得答案云、</p>
<h3 id="c224">思想與信仰 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>第三組爲思想與信仰</p>
<p>討論問題爲如何訓練我們正確中心信仰、由導師童行白發表意見、略謂思想與信仰問題、很難說明、因範圍太廣、從時間上說、思想有前進的、後退的、從性質上說思想有積極的、消極的、而且思想各個不同、猶各人人生觀一樣複雜、故思想須從自己發出、方有中心信仰、孫中山先生說得最明瞭、即先有思想、然後有信仰、然後有力量、思想是信仰的原因、信仰乃思想之結果、照個人觀察、中國最合宜的是三民主義的中心信仰、至於各们則請先把自己思想分析研究以後、才能走向一條路上、再思想過去也好、將來也好、因過去是經騐、將來是得到進步、過去是參考的工具、將來是研究之目標、中心思想、則須要把握現在云云、</p>

<p>第四組爲戀愛與結婚、</p>
<p>由導師章衣萍發表意見、略謂（一）戀愛不是游戲、戀愛是件正當事情、中學生不宜談戀愛、但亦不反對戀愛、（二）戀愛應負責任、過去戀愛自由、不知遺誤多少靑年、（三）結婚同時預到自己家庭環境云云、末由陶百川逐一加以說明並補充後、</p>

<p>浙江省教育廳秘書徐澤予、日昨來滬、記者晤於其滬寓、暢談浙江全省教育情形、據謂浙江教育、經蔣夢麟陳布雷張道藩葉溯中數任積極整頓、殊多進展、以現有經費、辦如許事業、支配亦甚得當、此次許廳長到任、對行政設施、己計劃周詳、内容當於來日詳談、至目前情形、</p>
<p>（一）教育經費獨立、指定箔類營業稅、烟酒附稅、屠宰營業稅三項、全年約二百萬元、作爲教育專欵、由財廳按日撥放、與江蘇省辦法不同、此事分三期實行、第一期箔類營業稅每月九萬元、全年百零八萬元、己於二十二年十一月實行、第二期箔類營業稅每月十萬元、全年百二十萬元、烟酒附稅全年二十萬元、合共百四十萬元、己於二十三年七月起實行、現在即在第二期、按月財廳撥放箔類營業稅及烟酒附稅十一萬六千六百六十六元、不足之數、由財廳另外找撥、自本年五月起爲第三期、箔類稅每月十萬元、全年一百二十萬、烟酒附稅二十萬、屠宰營業稅六十萬、合計二百萬元、</p>
<p>（二）去年各縣災荒、稅收大受影響、省立各校己欠費約四十萬元、年底徐財廳長己允先撥二十萬元、各校放假在即、確屬難以維持、至各縣市教育、七十五縣一市共計約三百三十一萬、受此次災荒影響、收入約須减少一百七十餘萬、故地方教育己陷於十分困難之境、各縣小學教員欠薪、多者己逹七八個月、少亦三四月、小學停閉者己屬不少、深望旅外浙江仁商各界、恊力救此勢瀕危亡之故鄕教育、教廳現請求在地方公債中、撥一百萬爲教育儲備金、救濟地方教育、此欵尙未領到、並規定各縣市編制教育經費緊縮預算辦法、在支出方面設法緊縮、</p>
<p>（三）全省中學、省立十三校、縣市立聯立二十校、私立四十九校、學生人數省立六二五三人、縣市立聯立四六零八人、私立九六九九人、合共二○五六○人、省立中學經費百萬餘元、縣市立聯立二十二萬餷元、私立八十三萬餘元、</p>

<p>此次許廳長到任、内部職員不主更動、新職員僅有四人、一洗普通行政機關新舊交替時之惡習、前任移交經費、日前報載現金二十九萬餘元、查係不確、因其中均爲飛機捐所得捐等代保管不能動支之經費或金庫劵、實際上移交現金僅數百元也、</p>

<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>光陰易逝、二十三年又將爲歷史上之年代矣、當此歲歷聿新、宜將一年經過之概况、作一復興回頋、勉示來茲、用將本年之過去情形、簡要叙述、以就正於當世之明逹、</p>
<p>（二）復興之經過</p>
<p>本校自一二八被燬以後、同人等秉教育即人生之旨、矢志復興、聘請各界名流組織復興設計委員會、於二十二年三月五日假社開會籌議、推定委員長及各職員、實施復興計劃、幸賴諸委員之熱心贊助、同仁之苦心毅力、歷五閱月、始將重建校舍經費、籌措就緖繪圖估價、决定於十月二十一日於原址興工建造、十一月四日舉行奠基典禮、到有黨政各界代表、諄諄以培植靑年爲復興民族之準備相勗勉、二十三年二月、全部工程告成、計教室一幢、宿舍一幢、復興堂一座、約可容學生七百餘人、四月八日舉行重建校舍落成典禮來賓參加者、濟濟一堂、本市吳市長親臨指導、勉以精神教育爲全校師生努力之標準、雨年來風雨飄摇之險象、至此始入穩定時期矣、（三）一年來之概况</p>
<p>本校自遷入新校舍後、物質上之設備、雖不能盡副人望、要亦粗具規模、惟教育事業、最當注重者、厥惟精神、茲分教務、訓育、體育、學生生活四項、以覘一年來之精神生活、</p>
<p>甲）教務中等學校教育、對於升學就業、須雙方兼顧、本校恪遵部定標準課程、實事求是、以期學生將來能用其所學、爲入社會入大學之準備、一年來對於教務上之事項可得而舉者、分述如下、</p>
<p>（一）添聘專任教員年來學生程度之不齊徵之於歷屆成績而益信、揆厥原因、由於學生之不努力者半、由於教員之不能專任者亦半、故本年度特添聘英國算自然等科專任教員旣可使教員能力集中、並可予學生多接近之機會以感情之融化、而引起學生讀書之興趣、</p>
<p>（二）舉行各科競賽分期舉行各科競賽己舉行者、如國文、算學、將舉行者、爲英語自然兩科以程度之差别定分組之標準每組前茅、均給奬品、以資鼓勵、</p>
<p>（三）參觀實業機關高級學生參觀各實業機關、以廣見識、先後參觀者、有龍華飛機廠、亞波爾電泡公司、康元製罐廠、上海印染公司閘北水電公司、新亞製藥廠等等、並命學生撰參觀報告、以促成學以致用之實際、</p>
<p>（四）檢查課内外成績每學期舉行小考二次外、並檢查課内外成績、如作文算學英語等練習簿、及各課筆記等等、以騐學生在課内是否潛心聽講、課外是否指導定工作研摩、</p>
<p>（五）增加畢業班級試騐畢業班級學生、在學程上可以告一叚落、畢業後或繼續入學或爲社會服務增加試騐、一則予溫故知新之機會、一則訓練思想之敏捷、</p>
<p>（六）聯絡學生家屬學校教育成績之優良、有賴於家庭教育之輔導者亦多、本校對於學生成績注重日常作業以免養成徼倖之心理、如小考成績有不及格者、即通知家長、以冀幫同督促、而增教學之效率、</p>
<p>（乙）訓育本校十八年來訓育素主嚴格不事放任、不施壓迫輔導學生自治納行動於正軌茲將原則及方法兩項略述如左、</p>
<p>（一）原則甲、恪遵教育主旨實施方針所規定陶融靑年忠孝仁愛信義和平之國民道德並養成勇毅之精神與規律之習慣、乙、發揚民族精神指導救國工作鼓勵親愛急公勞動堅忍等美德防止利己貪詐浪漫頽廢等惡習、（未完）</p>

<p>四對零報復前仇</p>
<p>兩半時各進兩隻</p>
<p>優游臘克斯昨日之西聯甲組足球賽、申園觀者約一千餘人、結果大出於一般人意料之外、優游竟以四對零之比數、全騰臘克斯、報復第一週中二對五失敗之辱、非特優游會同人歡天喜地、千餘觀衆、亦不覺手之舞之、足之蹈之、臘克斯在史高高托杯二週中、曾以一對零淘汰西捕、今則吃大鴨蛋、亦足見兵家之勝負無常也、</p>

<p>優游得開球優先權、隨</p>
<p>手即取攻勢、個個猛勇、</p>
<p>人人爭先、雙方攻守、周旋約六七分鐘時、優游己一鳴驚人、打開敵網、羅海光傳球於王南珍、王在左翼快馬加鞭、向中送去、孫錦順己在恰巧之中趕到、對凖一脚、腿動甚足、柯克倫撲救、僅僅擦得半隻皮球而己、</p>
<h3 id="c234">臘克斯反攻 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>臘隊取反攻之勢、哈脫倍克曾有一次美妙斜勿之球、爲張榮才救出、梁樹棠誤向復送、幸未成禍、江善敬因傷僅休息片刻復進、雪蒙斯向中開砲、雲逢霾在罰球綫外乎觸球上、鮑塞列主踼未中、在此三十分鐘臘克斯之反攻中、臘克斯因前鋒之缺少聯絡、終於妙手、空乎一無成就、</p>

<p>沈柏貴曾奇兵突出二次、孫錦順亦單騎刦寨、惜均來奏功、上半時之最後五分鐘、優游諸將、將臘門團團圍住、孫王連攻、皆爲柯克倫接出、球自左到右、王樹森冷眼靜觀、見有縫可鑽、一個箭步、在人叢中、一盤而進、上半時成二對零、</p>
<h3 id="c236">優游用重砲 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>下半時臘克斯開球、優游取重壓戰法、猛攻不己、臘克斯陣地、如在砲火連天之下、以守衛之嚴密、久久未破、孫錦順亦曾孤軍深入、如史丹谷所阻、旋用挑送方法、亦難得入、橫掃直冲、總不能進、亦足見攻守之烈矣、</p>

<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請柬投靠情殷</p>
<p>程志前連忙站起來向李士廉介紹道··這位是王北海君是這裹一位高中學生。他有志將來向北平去考大學，跟着我補習一點代數幾何。他實在用功，每日所習的練習題，他是一個也不丢下，天天送到我這裹來改。我雖然很忙，對於這樣用功的靑年，我總抽出一點功夫來補助他，所以他倒是天天到我這裹來的。不過他不大肯說話，就是他來了，也没有人知道呢。李士廉因爲程志前這樣的鄭重介紹着，倒不好意思不敷衍兩句，便笑道··這樣用功，眞是難得呵！口裹說着，眼光己是不免轉了過來。射到月英的身上來，笑道··你也來了。月英低着頭，抬了眼睛皮，向李士廉身上看着。李士廉跟着他這目光一射之間，嗤嗤的笑了起來。程志前看到，好不高興，不由得皺了眉毛，向李士廉望着，笑道··不要和她爲難。唉！一般都是可憐蟲。他雖是帶着笑容，說出這句話，然而在他這笑容以内，似乎還隱藏着很嚴重的態度。李士廉究竟也不願爲這點小事得罪了人家，他可是主席都請他吃飯。廳長都借汽車他出遊的人物呀。便坐在月英斜對面一張方発命子上，因笑道··我怎樣敢和這位姑娘爲難，我是聽到茶房說，他的喜信動了，我見着他就想起了這事，自然是忍不信笑笑。說着，又向月英飄了一眼。他是低頭坐着，兩脚併在一處，兩手撑了膝蓋。彷彿是他坐在這裹，手脚移動，都是自由的。程志前敬了李士廉一根烟，自己也抽了一根烟相陪。（一○五）</p>

<p>— 伊士</p>
<p>咱們家鄕｜宜興｜有這樣一句土語·呌「南京總督」·取名的意思是很滑稽而帶有點幽默氣味的。節序每到了嚴冬的時候·這一句土話常常會聽到的·尤其是在小飯館中，更可以見到一般人嘶破了喉嚨，在喊着「南京總督」。</p>
<p>離開了家鄕，遊學到上海來，在小飯館中也同樣可以聽到這句土話，現在又到了冬的季節了·「南京總督」也跟了上市了。</p>
<p>至於取名的意義，讓我先來介紹一下。爲了冬是一個寒冷的節候·吃飯時的許多菜·總不會熱烘烘的往肚嚥·因此把許多吃剩的菜·合起來去煮過·加添一些兒鮮料·這樣便呌做「總督」（督字是俗語·取其燒煮的意思·）而總督又是中央政府的意思·因此就喚爲「南京總督」了。</p>
<p>說也奇怪·總督有一種特别的鮮味·旣熱且可口·又經濟·比之幾元錢一客的和菜有過之而無不及·一般人都喜歡吃總督·卽其道理。</p>
<p>假使你有興緻的話·備幾兩白乾·一包花生米·漸漸兒合在一起吃·眞有說不出的鮮味·用來消磨這嚴冬的長夜，看你喜歡看的書籍·猜想這時候的樂趣·宛若飄飄乎登仙呢？一般閒情的士女們！不妨試一試「南京總督」的滋味·决不會使你們失望的。</p>

<p>一個女子嫁了美貌的男子，伊一定存了「一則心理，因爲得偶美男子，固然可喜，可是一方面又怕伊的丈夫另有所戀而失其所愛；反過來說：一個女子嫁了醜陋的丈夫，芳心裹雖然不悅，但是儘可放心，不必再去提防。於此可知天下事之没有絶對美满和絶對缺陷的。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>馬路上來往的人們中，總有抱着兩種絶對矛盾的心理··一種是「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜」：一種是「路見不平，𢬌刀相助」。前一種所稱爲老成持重」，也可稱爲「自私自利者」··後一種人呢，他們大都血氣方剛，再受了戲劇中十一郎和小說中金羅漢的薰陶，便成一位「事不干己亦要加入」的熱心人。不過這兩種人比較起來，總是後一種人吃虧的，所謂「煩惱皆因强出頭」是了··可是社會上也少不得這種人，現在我來舉二個例子吧！</p>
<p>電車上擁满了一車子人，累得那賣票的來不及賣票。有一位頑皮的孩子，躱在人叢中，手裹拿了銅元，老不買票。電車過了外白渡橋，坐客是稀少了，陡的跳上一位查票員來。查到了這位小孩子，便硬指賣票揩油。那賣票分辯不清，票子給他扯去，只好自認晦氣。那知橫裹跳出程咬金，有一位座客，替那賣票喊寃枉，並且還說··「大家中國人，」帮帮忙」。那知這位查票員把臉一沉說：「阿拉高麗人，不帮中國人的忙」。那座客便駡他是亡國奴，結果毆打起來，等到電車到站，這位事不關已的座客，竟合那查票員一同到巡捕房去。</p>
<p>早晨的小菜塲旁，滿佈着肩挑手提的小販。這般小販，按捕房章程是禁止的，所以他們一望見巡捕的影子，早向衖堂裏躱得無影無踪。這天有一個賣怱蒜的小孩子，呆頭呆腦，給巡捕拉住了。他賴在地下不肯去；嘴裏還在哭喊，頓時圍住了許多人觀看。有一位看客實在忍不住了，便向巡捕說項道：「怪可憐的，放了他吧」！那巡捕了搖頭道！「公事咧」！那看客見他不答應，又加上一句道··「捉住强盜，纔有功勞，捉幾個小販，不見得升你做三道頭」！那巡捕見他語帶譏諷，放了那小販，竟拖了那抱不平的看客到行裹去。</p>

<p>今天我們上射圃去，可說是一個最適宜而最有意思的日子！」伊照例是很鄭重地說道··「我們將藉此舉行一個紀念先人的儀式。因爲就在這天工夫上。我們有位祖先，他那時還祇是一個部落的領袖，並不是一個皇帝，可是部落間的鬥爭，照例是很普遍的··這一次，鬥爭又發生了，接戰之下，我們一方面形勢很不利，甚至食糧也斷絶了。挨到這天上，便不得把殘餘的一些冷飯，盡量的分給各人··但實在是太少了，使他們無法療飢，没奈何只得採了許多野生的生菜，夾着冷飯，勉强嚥下去，塞飽肚子。這是一個大概的情形。你們如其要知道詳細，還是待到了射圃中去再說吧！因爲這件故事所發生的地點，也是座森林，一座像射圃中的林子一樣濃密深邃的森林！」</p>
<p>這時候，站在伊面前傾着的依舊是整日價追伴着伊的一羣近臣，其中包括着光緖，隆裕，瑾妃，和我們八位女官。伊的眸子裹顯然有一種很得意的光彩，在閃動··一半的原因，也許是爲了伊連想到伊自己也是一個满洲人的領袖，所以伊一提起從前的一班領袖的勇敢和刻苦，便非常興奮起來了··其餘的半原因，也許是伊以爲今天又將有一種新的儀式，將由伊自己來領導我們起去舉行，因此覺得很高興。如其這個猜度是對的話，我就不能不對太扣發生一種詫異的感想。（二一五）</p>

<p>歸有光是明崑山人·震川是人家稱他的别號。他生而頴·九歲便能作文·但因屢試不第·直到五十八歲·才中進士·做長興縣的縣令·在死前一年六十五歲上·爲大學士高拱·趙貞吉引爲南京太僕丞·修世宗實錄·是他生平最煊赫的時期。</p>
<p>他的文章的特色·是在以眞實的感情述家常瑣事這一點。他的「思子亭記」項脊軒記」等小品文·與「先妣事略」同樣可以感動每一讀者，而使你不能忘却。而他描寫的忠實·用語的不避俚俗，大有現代人的風味。</p>

<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>十月二十九日，自英京赴蘇格蘭。十一月一日，在葛拉斯哥，搭招商局新輪「海貞」啓椗。蘇格蘭氣候嚴寒，船出海港，遥望山嶺積雪，船艙雖設備有水汀熱爐，猶覺寒氣襲人。但渡大西洋後，氣象驟變，地中海，紅海，與印度洋上熱度激增，如在炎夏。臥室中電風扇早夕旋轉，但夜上苦熱，不易入睡。白天終日無事，蓬頭跣足，單衫白褲躺在甲板上曬太陽看海，頗爲消遥自在。</p>
<p>同舟旅客連我祗四人，其他三旅伴都是留學比國學成榮歸的博士。我們各佔三等房艙，起居頗安適。船上廚師爲廣東人，每日三次西餐，吃得够厭，有時山博士們自己動乎，煮製中國飯菜，頗爲可口。航海正（俗稱二副）爲無鍚人薛邦祥君，卒業自利物浦航海學校。早夕過從閒談，五十日的長途海行，倒也不覺得寂寞。</p>
<p>「海貞」新在英國造船廠完工，這次處女航的行期，預算航海四十五天，可逹上海。本定十一月十四日可過蘇彝士運河，但爲了省煤的原因，船本每小時可行十五英里的速率，减至七八里許。至十五日上午三時，始泊蘇彝士運河北岸的寳賽。寳賽ＰortSaid爲埃及重要商埠之一，地居歐亞斐三洲的中衝，是從亞洲到歐洲必經的孔道。居民十九萬四千餘人，以亞拉伯及埃及人居大多數。寳實的土人，名譽極壞，偷盜居多，實則未必盡然，亦不過好人爲壞人所累耳。</p>
<p>船抵埠的前日，全船大起戒心，宣布戒嚴。大小門户，盡行鎖閉，即連救火皮帶，本懸諸壁上者，亦都取下納於貯藏室中。據海員們稱，寳賽土人善泅水，能乘人不備攀登甲板，竊取物件，無論杯盞，刀义，火柴，巾帕，都要順手牽羊，不可不事先防備。</p>
<p>黎明六時，即有埃及小販攀登甲板兜售貨品，有善操廣東語者，問同行Ｖ博士··「春宫要不要」，索價二先令，Ｖ博士以二先令成交，事後檢視，己非原貨，僅模特兒照片數幀，蓋早己「狸貓換太子」矣。</p>
<p>七時許，東方己白，旭日上升。有土人登船，促我們登陸遊覧。那時船長召雇的搬煤埃及人及亞拉伯，二十人一小舟，五六艘接尾而來，攀登四板，面目猙獰，望而生畏。我不慣煤屑灰塵及叫囂聲浪，即托土人代覓渡舟。但水手們相式勿從，恐遭不測。並警告以土人狡獪下流，雖客身畔無錢，亦有「剥猪玀」的危險。我們遂於九時許上岸，渡資每人來回各一先令，遊覧時由一老嚮導做翻譯伴侶。</p>
<p>老嚮導爲人很忠厚，殷勤而又誠懇，求之寳賽土人，實不可多得，我們在臨行時，共同簽名，出一介紹證書，以備他日國人遊覧實賽時，可得一可靠的導伴。</p>

<p>— 解冰士</p>
<p>除了幾個特别市之外·鎭江在國中也算重要了。因爲·江蘇省在國裹是富有的。自省政府遷鎭後·鎭江便成了江蘇省的省會。</p>
<p>省會·這名詞己經換了好幾年·對於醫藥和衛生方面自然更爲重要。現在的陳主席·盡力提倡衛生·所以一切都有相當的發展。雖没有像上海市和南京市那樣發逹。但是比前好多了。</p>
<p>現在·鎭江最大的治病機關｜江蘇省省立醫院。在省立醫院。在省立醫院未成立之先·由公安局衛生科設了貧民診所·公立的完全醫院和衛生機關一個也没有。私立的·大約和各地的相彷彿·設備一樣的完備·最老的·要推弘仁醫院了。｜｜内附屬護士學校·和鎭江縣主辦的農村護士學校。次之·基督醫院·婦糼醫院·因經費困難停辦。</p>
<p>在公立和私立治病機關未成立之先·只有非正式醫師開診所。那時·民衆不知什麽·總是治病的機關·並獲得好多數人的贊成。</p>
<p>自省立醫院成立以來·省會上得到了不少利益·就江蘇省直屬的各縣·也成立縣立醫院·這縣立醫院是由省立醫院支配。省立醫院的地直不適中·故在城中設立分診所·貧民産院。那時·生産死亡率很高·没有一位是訓練過的助産士。因急需要這種人才·訓練了幾班接生婆招來·告訴消毒方法·接産的簡法。當局感覺這種訓練後的接生婆·還是没圓满的成效，由此·就開始創辦江蘇省立助産學校·每班由每縣保送二人·畢業後分配各縣工作。</p>
<p>鎭江的防病機關·從今年才有·成立了衛生事務所·專做預防工作和一部分治療·學校衛生·商店衛生·殺畜塲的檢查·給了執照·才給營業呢。再有化騐室·帮助檢查的一種工具。</p>
<p>省辦的醫政學院·在十月十日開學。院長由陳主席兼任。内部共有四系··衛生行政系·醫學系，就是醫科··衛生教育系；及醫學研究系·就是國醫再受學理的訓練。這些人員·乃將來江蘇省衛生基本隊。</p>
<p>文字方面·宣傳防病與治病的機關·在省會中没有。以後，由弘仁醫院主辦了「大衆醫藥」週刋·是附在報紙上。共出刋了二十五期·那時·鎭江報紙對於文藝注重了·擴大文藝欄·把大衆醫藥週刋停了。總之·鎭江的報界·還没有認識衛生的重要·不能盡他們的天職。現在·再也没有這種刋物發現在鎭江了。</p>
<p>鎭江的自來水廠·是較有些歷史的。對於取水的水源·似乎太靠江邊·常有不潔之物染污。蓄水池有一丈六尺的深度，面積很小·用明攀助牠沉澱。濾床共有十個·用的急性砂濾。結果·水是很淸·這淸水不知要含多少菌呢！他們工廠裹·没有消毒法·也没有化騐室去檢查水·這是最可怕的··水是人們天天要飲的·與人身有密切的關係··那麽·這種無形之中殺人的機關·我們應當注意的。</p>
<p>說得多·並無統系。由此告一段結束吧！以後的鎭江衛生是有發展的·容後再貢獻於讀者吧。</p>

<p>引言｜醫學的教育｜醫學的團體活動｜醫事的糾紛｜醫學的出版界｜醫學的考察｜醫事的建設｜軍醫的訓練｜舊醫藥界的一斑｜新藥業的動態｜鄕村衛生的調查｜都市衛生觀｜結論</p>
<p>（一）引言</p>
<p>茫無盡期之時光波流·一息不停·向前奔放·而一年之光陰·遂若白駒之過隙。吾人在醫言醫·於此歷史長期之序幕上··對於一年來之中國醫藥衛生之變化·不能不深自體念·作一整個總括之叙述。</p>
<p>吾國醫藥衛生·溯自西洋科學醫之輸入·己具百年歷史。但其趦趄不進·與夫舊醫淹滯不前·同爲過去吾國醫學衛生·不能與世界各國爭長鬥勝之弱點｜惮憬現實·瞻念來茲·是又不能不將一年來吾國醫藥衛生進展之程度·詳細列比·以爲改進之路綫。</p>
<p>本篇之作·乃從史的觀察·述具崖略；更以客觀眼光·評其得失。俾能明其梗概·知其大勢··以爲吾人今後究應如何以推動中國醫學之前進？如何泯除中國醫事之糾紛？如何建設中國衛生之事業？如何促醒舊醫之迷夢？如何能使中國醫學將於世界放一異彩？雖然·此非拙筆所能形容其萬一··但求一獻芹曝·以爲抛磚引玉·且冀因是以獲當世賢哲之指正與力行焉。</p>
<p>（二）醫學的教育</p>
<p>吾國醫學教育爲如何？最近本刋汪企張先生己有詳細評述·若暗室明燈·燭照無遺！綜括一言··過去吾國之醫學教育·均爲被動異化之教育·且有日趨危亡之朕兆！二十三年中·教部雖有醫學教育委員會之設立·課程標凖大綱之擬定·但醫學教育異化之傾向·並未因此稍减。現據調查所得·吾國現有醫校·共爲三十一所·其性質之區别·約歸五類··</p>
<p>國立　　　　　　　　　　四</p>
<p>省立　　　　　　　　　　六</p>
<p>私立　　　　　　　　　　八</p>
<p>教會及外人設立　　　　　十一</p>
<p>軍醫　　　　　　　　　　二</p>
<p>依上表之觀察·知教會及外人設立之醫校·適佔全國醫校比數三分之一。近年來教部曾有醫校畢業年限之規定··定醫學院爲六年畢業·醫專校爲四年畢業··但今之醫校學程·竟至有七年·六年·五年·四年畢業者不等·如此不能規合爲一·而外人教育又如此之多·則醫學教育之異化·安望能積極糾正·而逹吾國醫育自動自主之目的？</p>
<p>二十三年十月中·微聞教部醫育委員會擬之醫學課程標凖草案·己正式脫稿·並分别徵請北平·上海·漢口等各大都市之醫學專家·發表意見。足見教部醫育委員會諸公·虚懐若谷··愈見此事之鄭重·然不可無一言進之··</p>
<p>吾人旣知吾國醫學教育之日趨異化！則如何挽此狂瀾？惟視今後醫學課程標準爲如何·然後一言可决。此次教部所訂之醫學課程標準，愧未能一窺全文，不敢率爾申論。就諸傳言··似課程標準中，於醫用文字，將外國文若分等級，以漢文爲上，以德法爲下，以日文更次之，果屬事實，則將來醫育趨於異化之結果，必有更勝於今日？夫一國之文字·不過人爲之標記；簡言之·乃一符號而己。吾人欲吸收國外學術，固以習外國文爲捷徑，然不可强習某國文字以爲善。今之學者，各國文字皆有認識之必要，而後可望　取各國之長·融會貫通，而爲吾國之長··否則·斤斤於一國文字之醒求，必也數典忘祖，强以某國學術之長，而鄙視吾國所無·强以某國文字之方便·而譏吾國文字爲無用·循此日進，則未來中國之科學醫·豈非洋化之尤？則未來吾國醫育之異化·尙堪問乎？吾人目擊此種傾向之危險·重視英文固不可，側重德法亦不必·見仁見智，各有會心，是故醫用文字，不可强爲釐定也。</p>
<p>吾國醫師數量之缺乏，夫人盡知，二十三年各醫學校畢業生人數，與吾國人口比例，約得二十五萬分之一猶弱，大有才難之嘆！僅將己調查確實之醫校畢業生人數，列表明之藉見一斑。</p>
<p>上海醫學院　　　十三人</p>
<p>北平大學醫學院　四十人</p>
<p>河北省立醫學院　十四人</p>
<p>北平恊和醫學院　二十五人</p>
<p>廣州夏葛醫學院　十四人</p>
<p>上海聖約翰醫學院十七人</p>
<p>上海震旦醫學院　八人</p>
<p>濟南齊魯醫學院　十四人</p>
<p>上海東南醫學院　一百十五人</p>
<p>「附註」未調查確實者，均未列入。</p>
<p>從上表觀察··深覺吾國醫育學制系統，</p>
<p>至不一律，上舉各醫校之畢業生，最少者僅有八人，最多者又超出百人以上，僅北平醫學院之畢業生人數，與教部規定每班五十人，較爲接近，餘均出入頗多。吾人感於今日吾國醫才之缺乏，則每年醫校畢業生人數，其遞增之量，最低限度，應遵照教部規定之標準。否則，興替醫學人才有如此之難，則普及中國科學醫之希望，將永無日矣。</p>
<p>吾國醫學名詞之龐雜，萬花撩亂，至不統一。二十三年春，教部曾有醫學名詞審查委員會之組織，聘宋悟生，朱恒璧，陶熾蓀，宋國賓諸先生等爲委員，殊有一記之價値也。</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（三十）眼的衛生</p>
<p>眼的部位雖小。然一旦罹病。則其危險常大。試觀盲人的痛苦。卽可概知。所以吾人平時對於眼的康健。豈容疎忽。茲特略將它的衛生。摘要舉成十條。若能實行。未始不無裨益啊。、</p>
<p>（一）早起早睡。雖爲一般衛生上的原則。然亦卽是養眼的要道。我們知道常患結膜炎（赤眼）的人。大都不是早起早睡。</p>
<p>（二）不用公共塲所的毛巾。可免沙眼的傳染。</p>
<p>（三）强光和閃光。都足損眼。切須避免。所以在夏天的烈日·或冬天的白雪·行路的時候。最好載以墨色或黃色的保護眼鏡。可以避去强烈光綫的刺戟。</p>
<p>（四）乘車時·不宜閱書。因字體動摇。有損目力。</p>
<p>（五）若有灰砂煤屑侵入眼内。不必立刻按擦眼瞼。應當暫時閉目。靜待異物隨着涙液流出眼外。因爲涙液可使附着於眼内的灰砂煤屑。滑潤流出。亦卽涙液具有天然排除眼内異物的功能。</p>
<p>（六）眼球和視物的距離。當以三十生的米突最爲相宜。閱書寫字的時間。不應過於長久。應當時常閉目休息。調節眼肌。勿使過度工作。</p>
<p>（七）在光綫不足。日光直射等處。或黃昏時候。均不宜讀書寫字。</p>
<p>（八）閱書寫字時候的燈光。必須來自前面左上方。不可用背光。燈光和視物的距離。旣不能過遠。又不可過近。大約以一尺半最爲適當。光力以用五十支光爲宜。燈罩應用綠色。燈泡當以磨砂泡面爲佳。</p>
<p>（九）大便日須通暢。以避眼部的充血。</p>
<p>（十）近視眼應戴適當的矯正眼鏡。不可隨决配置。須經眼科醫師檢騐後。再由光學師配置。方爲妥當。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>（五）專門的診斷｜｜鐵勃固靈反應</p>
<p>鐵勃固靈在診斷上的應用方法·是如何的情形呢？他係分眼反應法和皮反應法兩種的。在皮反應法一方面·又有皮膚皮外皮内和皮下四種方法的分别。再加上眼反應法·尋常通稱爲鐵勃固靈五種反應。這五種方法，是差不多包括診斷上應用全體的。關於他們的詳細情形·現在且一一分述在下面··</p>
<p>（Ａ）眼反應　用百分之一鐵勃固靈溶液一滴·滴入眼結膜中·尋常在八小時至廿四時以内·結核病者大都在此眼會發生結膜炎的。但如果反應係陰性·也可以用百分之四的同樣溶液一滴滴入另眼，以觀其最後結果的。這一種診斷法，對於有熱度結核疑症比較最宜··但如果曾患眼疾·或正患眼疾·以及有腺疾的小孩·都應該禁忌的。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）皮膚反應　這又名爲Ｐirquet氏反應；他的手續·是和尋常的種痘方法差不多的。法以上膞或前膞皮膚，先用醇拭凈，然後取鐵勃固靈溶液一二滴，（百分之廿五溶液，與千分之五的石炭酸混和而得的）滴於皮膚·再用小刀穿破該部皮膚；此外，在距離相當處，最好不創，以便雙方可作凖確比較。此種反應如係陽性·那末，在接種部會發生炎性腫脹的；這種情形·在另外的皮膚小創是决對没有的。反應的發生·大概在二十四和四十八時之間；也有過五六小時就會迅速發生的，也有遲至三四日後方發現的。溫度增高的情形是狠少見着的。｜｜這一種方法，比較應用最普遍；因爲他在無論任何狀態下·都没有什麽禁忌的；並且他的反應陽性的價值·也比較眼部來得凖確可靠。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）皮外反應　一名Ｍoro氏軟膏反應。法以鐵勃固靈與無水羊毛脂製成之軟膏·取豌豆大小一塊·塗擦於皮上（最好在左鎖骨下方胸部，）約一二分</p>
<p>時，塗擦面積勿過大·約如一銀圓光景。尋常在廿四或四十八小時後，其塗擦部分的皮膚，會發生赤色小結節，自數個或敷十個不定的；這就是陽性反應的表現了！這一種方法·在結核診斷方面，和皮膚反應是有同等之價値的。</p>
<p>（Ｄ）皮内反應　怎樣呌皮内反應呢？就是將鐵勃固靈溶液注射到皮内去··在此時際，皮膚表面照例是會發生突起狀小泡的，但緩緩卽會消减的。溶液的成分，起首是一比五千光景，後來也可以增加到一比一百或一比十之成分的。過了十二或廿四小時光景，如果發現陽性反應了，在他注射的部分，係會發生紅腫侵潤狀態的，並且覺痛楚的。這一種情形，差不多在四十八小時左右是最劇烈；部分則以上膊爲最顯著，腿部及腹部次之。全身的反應，像體溫增高等情，也是絶無僅有；所以在任何狀熊下，也是没有什麽禁忌，和皮膚反應是異曲同工的。至於他在診斷上的價値，也是很凖確的；甚至有時别的方法都没有結果，單靠這種試騐來定最後之是非的。</p>
<p>（Ｅ）皮下注射反應　怎樣呌皮下反應呢？就是用尋常的皮下注射手續，將鐵勃固靈溶液注入之謂。這種陽性反應大半是會發生全身狀態的，所以行使這種手續，須非常小心，最好是待各種應有盡有的試騐都没有满意的答覆以後。病人在接受注射的時候，須於三日前將終日體溫以及其他症象均爲檢明··如尋常溫度超過攝氏卅七度者，卽不宜注射。此外若患有心臟病，腎臟病，以及最近曾經欬血者，此種試騐均須禁忌。溶液的成份，尋常是一比千的稀釋液，首次的用量，祗須此稀釋液全體千分之一己够；如無陽性反應發生，可緩緩按次增加，但最多祗能加至十倍，卽無陽性反應，也應該以此爲止的。病人經注射後，須臥床休息，不可動作，每兩小時檢查體溫一次。反應的發現，早則七八小時，遲至十一二小時；他是除開局部的反應外，同時并兼有全身和病灶兩方症象的，這是上述的四種所没有的。</p>
<h3 id="c262">瘧疾概述（三） <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 王曉嵐</p>
<p>瘧疾預後</p>
<p>間日瘧及三日瘧致命者甚稀，祗久病羸瘦者或衰弱老人罹之·間能誘發心肺疾患，預後危險，其反復發作，荏苒或慢性瘧或瘧惡液質者亦然。如體質强健者染之，常因瘧原虫繁殖不旺，發作停止，宛若自然就愈，但其無雌雄性虫體譖伏身内，俟體力减弱及其他誘因，卽乘機復發，冬令天氣寒冷，瘧不傳染，而仍見發生者·實由於此。據志賀潔氏記載，罹三日瘧，有閱五至十五年而再發之例。惡瘧療治得宜，亦易就痊，惟成惡液質或異型症象者往往致死·黑水熱死亡率，據歷來統計·約五至一六％。</p>
<p>瘧疾診斷</p>
<p>瘧疾特徵爲定型之寒熱發作·脾腫，貧血，血中含瘧原虫，大單核白血球增多等症象，若不檢查血液，僅憑其他症狀爲診斷標凖·當間日瘧與三日瘧最初發作·或惡瘧熱型不定·或數種瘧虫混合感染等時·頗易與傷寒，敗血症，肺炎，肺癆，粟粒癆，回歸熱，流行感冒，急性心内膜炎，肝臟梅毒等症混淆。慢性瘧則與膀胱炎，腎孟炎扁桃腺炎，副鼻腔炎。齒炎。潛伏膿瘍，腸寄生躍等症類似，瘧惡液質則與白血病肝臟硬變症相若，異型惡瘧每與霍亂腦膜炎中風，尿毒症，急性中毒等誤診，非注意鑑别，不能確定。</p>
<p>檢查血液，有二法，取病者血液塗製標本，於顯微鏡下檢視，僅證明紅血球中有能動之色素顆粒及原形質小塊者，曰，不染檢查法，塗製血液標本，以一烷醇固定，用羅麻司客（Ｒomanowsky）氏（卽一·％美藍水溶液一分，○·一）％伊紅水溶液五分，混合浸染二十分鐘。）或基姆薩（Ｇiemsa）氏（卽基姆薩氏液五滴，蒸餾水五西西，混合浸染十五分鐘。）或伍德（Ｗood）氏（卽將○·一）％伊紅液及○·二五％阿醋爾Ⅱ液（ＡzurⅡ）分二次染色。）染法，染色檢查，則紅血球呈淡紅色，瘧原虫呈藍色，曰，染色檢查法。</p>
<p>若血中瘧原虫較少，不易檢出，更可施羅司（Ross）氏染法，以血液厚滴塗片，俟其乾燥，侵入二％富而馬林與一％醋酸之等量混合液中，約三分鐘，溶去血色素，以水洗之，乾後，再用基姆薩氏染法，染色檢查，如瘧原虫潛伏於脾肝，骨髓，肌肉等儲藏血液之臟器中，須施挑撥瘧虫法，或於脾臟部灘澆冷水，或以日光及人工太陽燈照射，或注射腎上腺素，煮沸牛乳，蛋白體等於肌肉内，或注射亞爾沙色丁（·Arsacetin）於皮下，使血液循環變動或臟器收縮，驅瘧原虫入血，經過數小時，再行檢查</p>
<p>瘧疾治法</p>
<p>（一）特殊治法　古代以鷄納樹皮治瘧，迨派爾替氏等析出其重要成分奎寗，（Chinin）能撲滅遊離血中瘧原虫，遂獲特效之譽。但對潛居内臟中虫體及惡瘧之半月形有性生殖體，功力不著，且物異體質者或姙婦用之，有頭暈，嘔吐，耳鳴，敗胃等副作用，及誘發黑水熱墮胎等危險，爲其弱點。自許萊門（Ｓchulemann）氏等，製撲瘧姆星，能殺惡瘧之有性生殖體，輔奎寗所不及，故其合齊鷄納撲瘧姆星，治瘧尤效。近則蜜須（Mietzsch）氏等製瘧滌平，功用與奎寗同，無副作用，特異體質或姙婦用之，可無顧慮，治瘧之法，更臻完備。</p>
<p>鹽酸奎寗或硫酸奎寗，每日用量爲○·九至一·二克。治間日瘧及三日瘧，宜在發作前五小時服一克，或分五次每隔二小時服○·二克，皆須連用三日，其後再日服○·五克，連用三週，可獲根治。或以瘧滌平日服三次，每次○·一克，連用七日亦可。治惡瘧須照前法服売瘧滌平（Atebrin）後，再日服撲瘧姆星（Plasmoquine）○·○三至○·○四克，連用三日或單用鷄納撲瘧姆星（Quino|Plasmoquine）日服三次，每次一片，連用三週，效力甚著。其重症者，可用奎寗或鷄納撲瘧姆星肌肉注射，上述各藥用量，老人及糼兒，均應酌减。</p>
<p>鹽酸奎寗（Chininum　bydrochloricum）或硫酸奎寗（Chininum　sulfuricun）其味極苦，糼兒内服，每用屋伊奎寗（Euchinin）或亞利司脫辛（Aristochin）等無味製品，但二者之用量，須較鹽酸奎寗增加半倍。如避免奎寗内服，可行注射法及灌腸法。此外米替靈藍（Methylenblau）三○三（Peracrina）斯砒螺刺脫（Spirocid）斯多凡耳所（）脫特奎那（Totaquina）馬拉康（Malarcan）等内服，或注射新洒爾佛散，（NeosaLvarsan）治瘧均有相當效力，尤以砒劑與奎寗混合治療爲佳。但終不若撲瘧姆星與瘧滌平或奎寗併用，奏效確實。</p>
<p>（二）對症治法　病者惡寒時，應以熱濕布或熱水袋溫其肢體，如嘔吐，可内服古加因或注射，發熱時，頭部用冰嚢，并服鹽酸或枸椽酸等製成之淸凉飲料，發汗時，宜防感冒，如出汗過多，可服阿片製劑，或以酒精，醋酸等拭其皮膚，慢性瘧及瘧惡液質，須注意營養，兼用補血劑及健胃劑，脾臟腫大，可行電氣療法，冷水灌注法，汞類油膏塗擦，注射碘劑，或施脾臟摘出術，黑水熱發作，須令病者絶對安靜，注射强心劑，并以鹽化鈣内服或注射，制止血球溶解，以生理食鹽水注射或灌腸，兼用利尿劑，防腎臟細尿管塡塞。</p>
<p>（三）病後調治　瘧疾停止發作後，須反復檢查血液，並行挑撥瘧蟲法，使潛居内臟中原蟲入血，繼續施療，以期根治，住所宜空氣新鮮，日光充足，食物宜擇富熱量及鐵質之肉類，豆類，綠菜·鮮果，乳，卵，肝油等配合應用。欲催進血液新生，應酌行適度之運動或溫浴，並用刺激造血機能之鐵劑，砒劑，如奥拍太純，補爾神，萬利康等注射，或雞納鐵葡萄酒及肝臟製劑利凡命等内服。倘貧血過甚，須擇血型適合者，行輸血法。慢性瘧及瘧惡液質，宜擇一五○○至二·○○○米之高山地帶，轉地療。養，使紅血球增加。</p>
<p>瘧疾預防</p>
<p>凡居瘧疾流行之區。或前往該區者，欲預防傳染，應服抗瘧藥。如用奎寗，第一日可服○·二克·間日倍之，反復連用，或每晚服雞納撲瘧姆星一片，直至該區己無瘧疾發生，或離開該區後四週爲止，屢能獲效。此外宜避瘧蚊刺螫，住所應擇高燥地帶，因瘧蚊喜低飛，尤以樓居爲宜。庭隅可植向日葵等·俾土地乾燥淸潔，蚊類不易混跡，臥榻須懸蚊帪，窗户宜裝紗網，倘瘧蚊入室，須燃除蟲菊驅之。當外出時，若用面紗，手套或以新鮮之得椽汗塗布身體裸露之處，防護尤爲周密。</p>
<p>瘧疾之公衆預防，英醫羅司（Ross.）氏主張撲滅瘧蚊，絶其傳染之媒介，重在由政府設置專員，改善境内卑濕土地，塡塞池沼，開河引流，使積水完全排除，蚊類不能繁殖。按時以煤油等澆灌溝渠，殺其孑。英美諸國，行之最力，巴拿馬一帶城鎭，業己獲效，德醫柯赫（KoGh）氏則主張撲滅病者血中之瘧蟲，去其傳染之本源。重在由政府實施瘧疾官醫·規定防治方法，在瘧疾發生時期，强施於一般民衆，俾罹瘧疾者獲根治。意大利諸國奉行最力，亦有良效。</p>
<p>國際聯盟瘧疾委員會，鑒於各國社會經濟情形及人民生活狀况不同，不易仿行他國之有效成法，遂於一九二八年公表抗瘧方針，分别緩急，循序進行，首重療瘧，减少傳染病源，次則就各地情形及環境，研求瘧蚊之種類。習性，及孳生地點，選用適當之預防法，並籌根本建設，改良社會狀况及人民生活，使其間接增加抗瘧能力。最後則施改良土地法，引流排水，撲滅蚊類，完成抗瘧工作。我國民生凋敝，瘧疾蔓延日甚，衛生署己本國聯抗瘧方針按步進行，若全國人士通力合作，庶可早期完成也。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c268">詩人與詩 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>隨園詩話中有一節論詩人的·非常奇怪·也非常有道理。云··「王西莊光祿爲人作序云··所謂詩人者·非必其能吟詩也·果能胸境超脱·相對溫雅·雖一字不識·眞詩人矣。如其胸境齷齪·相對塵俗·雖終日咬文嚼字·連篇累牘·乃非詩人矣。」這段話非常的道理。詩人不是隨便可做的·而做這種詩人·尤其難。詩是人人可以做的·而天才却不是人人能有的。而所謂天才·其中又包涵許多成分·如眼光銳敏·感情豐富等等皆是。如果要談到如何謂之眼光銳敏，恐怕一時也說不完。看雲是一種很普通的事，人人俱能看到·而詩人眼中之雲，却與常人不同，他能由雲中能幻想出許多奇妙東西來。下雪時候的景象，是人人得見的·别人只以爲天不過是在下雪·宇宙間一切都是白的·僅此而己，而在詩人的眼中却不同，古人有兩句形容下雪的打油詩云「江上一籠統·井口黑窟窿，」看來似極平淡，其實形容雪景是非常佳妙的·我們如果到鄕間去·在下大雪的時候·出門來看一看便知這兩句詩的妙處了。這是人人能見的·而旁人却不知這可以作詩料。好的詩却往往是很平凡·人人盡知·而人人皆未道出的。天下之一事一物未有不堪入詩者·如門口的賣硬麵餑餑的·在夜間總來吆喝·平常人聽了·無甚感觸·而詩人聽了·却能想到那賣硬麵餑餑的總有一天要不能做買賣的。於是便幻想出有一個天天買硬麵餑餑的小孩子·忽然因爲某一天没有聽見賣硬麵的在門口吆喝。那小孩便猜着他也許是老死了，也許是走在馬路上不小心被電車軋死了，也許是他病了，因爲賣硬麵餑餑的曾對小孩子說過·他這樣大歲數·没有兒子的。於是這小孩子又幻想他也許是病在床上·而没人去給他買藥。這首詩由小孩子買不着餑餑吃·而在反面襯托出賣硬麵餑的老頭兒的悲哀·是非常動人的。還有一首詩·也是形容一個賣硬麵餑餑的，作者是徐計先生·大意說·現在誰家不買洋點心·誰還來買硬麵餑餑。僅僅這兩句便烘托出中國小手工業的落伍，無産階級的悲哀。這是另有一種妙處的。還有一首詩·是形容一個乳娘這詩曾在自由談上刋登·作者我記不淸了，說一個鄕下婦人把自己的孩子犧牲了，却到城市裹來把乳液供給富人的孩子。我看來當時非常感動·這也是一首好詩。所以作詩·一方面是須要眼光銳敏，見人所未見，一方面是要情感豐富。以上所舉的例·都是很平凡的事·而經過詩人胸襟一融化·便是很美很動人的東西。詩·這種東西·不必满處去找，只在眼前就有·可是只看你詩人的天才没有。不必死翻書本·也不必到各處去尋美景，有的人在冬令要踏雪尋梅，在秋天非得要望月，然後才能有詩，那都不是詩人，明陳明卿云··「天地問一種現成文字·如雲物之瞹淡·河海之傾瀉，怪木奇鳥之種種於目前·恣我斟酌把玩·造物殊不貧·亦不吝。」所以說詩境是很寬的·也許有學者·讀破萬卷書，終日作詩·亦無一首好詩·而於村　工人的口中却能流露出極美妙的詩句來。現在有許多人頗喜讀歌謡·便是這種緣故。</p>
<p>除此之外，我認爲詩還須美，我所說的美，乃是自然的美·而不是彫琢字句的美，如唐人的詩··「停車坐愛楓林晚·霜葉紅於二月花。」在字句上却不見得如何美·而在意境上却非常的美·這便是自然的美·如果彫琢字句·絶不會有這樣美的詩意。我們讀古人的詩·他們各有各的作風·絶不相同·李白之豪放·與東坡之豪放不同·杜甫與樂天不同·陶元亮與王維又不同·這是各人的天性不一樣，所以詩也絶不能和人學，卽學也學不來，倒反不如見從己出·要說什麽·便說什麽·有時或許會有好詩。淸沈晚村有詩云··「身安萬事閒，日落一村靜·携兒向月明，壁上看人影」。頗悠閒可喜·這便是肯說自己的話的好處。事情是很平常的·只是大人領着孩子晚上到村外去閒溜躂，然而意境是非常的佳妙。這樣我們也就可以知道詩是什麽東西了。如果有人要問怎樣能好詩，怎樣能作詩人？那只好請他自己去想，這種秘密我恕不奉告。</p>
<h3 id="c269">遊千佛山 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>若要我說千佛山的好處，那好處不在牠的本身，因爲從濟南的街上看去，峯巒姿影，也並不見得怎樣秀麗，或者壯偉；黃色的陡坡上，胡亂點綴些墨黑的柏樹，有什麽特别動人的地方呢？也許在春夏天，坡上披着靑緑的草衣，傍晚黃昏，峯頭抺着淡藍的烟靄，出遠處看來，是很美麗的吧？可是這只算一般的山通有的景緻，千佛山的特色却並不能由此認出的。你且慢爬上山去，越過廟宇，攀上岩石嶙峋的峯頭，然後掉回頭來，陡然望見盆一樣的大明湖，躺在萬家烟火的濟南城裹，帶似的黃河，繞在蒼茫無際的天野時，這才一下子覺出千佛山之所以愛爲遊人登臨而且成爲北國名勝的原因，大約一定是在這裹了。</p>
<p>我去遊的時候，正在冬天，但因還没有落雪，山路却是很好走的，而且兩三年來，全住在江南的城市，走的都是平路，一旦遇着了並不怎樣陡險的山坡，就彷彿驟然碰見了舊友似的，走爬起來，實在富有興味，雖然有點喘氣，疲倦襲人，但回頭看看，視野逐漸擴大，拘束身心的街巷墻壁，業己全然消失，便也感到無限慰安，精神倍加了。上廟宇的山路，舖有尺許寛五尺多長的石板，兩旁且築有短墻，甚爲整潔，想來這是專爲拜菩薩的人修的。否則，那由廟後再上峯頂，始能盡遊觀之樂的地方，就不必單山遊人的草鞋和布履，去自闢蹊徑探尋了。頂上，風極大，一面須防吹落帽子，一面又要用手攀緣岩地，不時且有矮叢刺芭，掛人衣衫，因此爬時極爲狼狽，但愉快和興奮却不能因此减去，絲毫，這大約山於登臨愈險，便愈能增加壯匊的原故吧。</p>
<p>上頂的時候，約莫午後三點鐘的光景，膠濟鐵路的火車，噴着乳白的烟霧，自遠而至，其連馳的情形，也極類一羣黑色母猪，笨拙地走在泥濘中一般。濟南城市和大明湖的面積比較，己經早不是老殘所見的「一城山色半城湖」了都市己給鐵路的灌輸，完全龐大起來，西面的紅色屋頂無數，正標明古老的濟南，那近代化的程度，是到不淺的了。將來的遊人也許竟會從容不迫地坐着電車來到山脚下吧。在頂上僅看見一些色彩和輪廓，想着這，却是下山以後的事了。</p>
<p>這次雖然没有看見「黃河之水天上來」那般汹湧情形，但蛇也樣地懶懶睡在天野裹的姿態，也就僅够同一個旅人爲之歡躍起來。河身在轉折的地方，約現出三四丈寛的光景，同大明湖的淸水比較看來，則作淡黃的顔色。其餘便像淺黃的絲帶一樣，如果河身不微微發光的話，那就和北方的原野分别不出來了。</p>
<p>下山比較上山難些，處處提防失足，不敢舉目遠望，到這時才覺得遊山的辛苦，但人還是愉快的，高興的，因爲北方雄偉的風景業己描在心上了。</p>
<h3 id="c270">落花生船 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>一進冬，一些客帮的做生意船全泊到河畔來，一長排地，從浙江開來的製稱船；從江北開過來的，有捕魚小艇子，修洋傘船；還有收舊貨件船，同時，落花生船也開來了。</p>
<p>那些船，大多每年冬裹一定時節來，到明年初春天開回去，他們在家鄕種一些租田，因爲吃口多，維持不下，到田事空暇的冬天再開一條船到外鄕來做點兒零星小生意，然而年勢不影氣，那些小艇子上各處鄕鎭去，也做不起好生意。</p>
<p>一條賣落化生的江北船，泊到我們學校門口河灘邊來己是好多天了。</p>
<p>每天一散課，跟一位同事到河濱上散閑步；河岸上這幾天多了一個賣落花生的小攤子，船上邊三個五六歲的小孩子，身上襤褸不成樣，像在泥水潭裹滾過一下兒，赤着小脚，小臉上全爬满着皱裂；河岸是他們的遊戲塲，滾着石片磚塊，楳楂子，破鐵罐子，做玩意兒，他們把些運動具玩得有勁兒地。</p>
<p>這幾個襤褸孩子，是那條落花生船上的。</p>
<p>太陽落山時，一個五十來歲的老頭子挑着落花生擔子從小街上歸來了，把擔子毫不費力的停到河岸上，然後拐到跳板上，船裹一個中年女人從蘆棚裹探頭出來，髒汚的臉上翻着一絲希望的笑，跟一個親切的聲音，一同地。</p>
<p>｜弄到幾吊？</p>
<p>老頭子黧黑的臉巴一沉，撇了嘴角，一脚踏到船頭上去，船身一幌，他没答話，爬到船棚裹去。</p>
<p>到蘆棚裹去找了個烟蒂兒，又拐到岸上來了，檢數着丢在木桶裹的一堆銅子，一邊數，一邊皺着眉毛；那三個襤褸孩子就圍到他身邊去，叫着··</p>
<p>｜老阿爸，老阿爸！</p>
<p>｜老阿爸，給一個銅板囉；</p>
<p>他嘟噥着，把孩子全駡開去。</p>
<p>我們上前去跟他扯談起來：</p>
<p>｜老頭兒，每天可做多少生意？</p>
<p>｜先生，今年比往年還差啦！</p>
<p>｜唔。</p>
<p>｜每天只換到一吊八百······</p>
<p>｜這幾天，米比往年又貴啦！日子難過啦！</p>
<p>｜你們船上有多少吃口？</p>
<p>｜唔，先生，船上一家七口囉，老婆子，大兒子，媳婦，三值小孩兒；每天弄到一吊八。那數目，不够活囉！</p>
<p>｜你們江北那地也荒吧？</p>
<p>｜也荒囉！年勢壞，種田也不上運兒；生意也做不起。舊年頭到這兒賣花生果，每天弄到四吊五吊，就好，今年每天最多兩個攤弄到只兩吊囉！</p>
<p>他告訴我們這小生意無可再做，想弄點本錢賣甘蔗橘子。</p>
<p>船尾上騰起炊烟了，老頭兒的那個年輕媳婦在爐口煨着野柴煮粥，把竹管兒噓火。呼呼地。</p>
<p>老頭子把河岸上的落花生攤子搬下船去，天己黑下來了。</p>
<p>暮色蒼茫的河上，我們看那船上老少一家七口，圍蹲在船尾上，用一鍋稀粥的夜餐。</p>
<h3 id="c271">對於今後文藝批評的要求 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 胡繩</p>
<p>作爲中國文壇在一九三四年中的特色，我以爲文藝批評的漸漸走上了正軌這一點是應該鄭重地提出來的。</p>
<p>嚴肅的「作家論」代替了所謂「印象記」銳利的「書報批評」代替了所謂「讀後感」｜這都是過去一年來的好現象。</p>
<p>曾經有一作家之羣」以爲批評的效果便是作家「擱筆」，但其實呢，好的批評只有使作家更積極起來的，牠將領導後者向正確的道路上前進！</p>
<p>繼承了一九三四年己有的成績，一九三五年的文藝批評將呈顯與我們一個更豐满的姿態的吧？｜我們，讀者們虔誠地這樣的希望。</p>
<p>在希望中間，我想在這裹提出幾點小小的要求來：</p>
<p>在建設新的文藝批評的時候，國外的文藝理論的介紹實在是必需的。記得以前水沬書店，光華書店，大江書舖等都曾出過成套的文學理論叢書，但近來這樣的書却出得似乎是太少了。因此和在文學創作上一樣，今後在批評上也是需要着大規模的翻譯介紹的工作的｜這是我的要求之一。</p>
<p>「批評家不但要批評别人，而且要批評自己，不但要互相批評，而且要自我批評，一切不好的批評也是應該批評的對象之一····」任白戈先生的這幾句　（見太白第二期）確是很對。在今日我們看見··有些人掛着「作家論」的大拾牌却只作着章句辭藻的貼刮工夫，更有人呢，聰敏些的硬攀着吉爾波｜，老實些的便拉着白璧德，一樣都大言不慚地在「批評」着···因而我的要求的第二點便是：在新的文藝批評的立塲上給與這些五花八門的理論以適宜的打擊｜批評！</p>
<p>文學批評固然應在｜使老的作家不致腐朽下去，這一點上盡最大的努力，但同時牠更應該刻刻不忘記從各種報紙雜誌上發掘新的作家出來，指導他們前進；並且牠還不但要找出有希望的新作家來，而更應該注意到那些剛開始寫作的文藝學徒，利用種種機會，在技巧上，在取材上帮助他們，鼓勵他們：｜新作家的源源不絶的出現是保持文壇少壯的惟一的方法，新的文藝批評忽略了這一方面將自行喪失掉意義。</p>
<p>此外，我還有一點附帶的要求！我以爲，只在一般的文藝雜誌上來幾篇作家論，附一欄「書驇批評」畢竟是不够負擔起新的文藝批評的重大任務的，因而，一個專門的文藝批評的雜誌是必需的。雖然在一九三四年的雜誌年中也有一兩種的文藝批評雜誌，但顯然，那都不能使我們满意。我們所希求的是介紹國外正確的理論，隨時檢討我們這文壇，而又能督促，鼓勵，帮助一切作家與初學者的這樣的一個文藝批評的刋物！</p>
<h3 id="c272">蒼蠅（六） <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 意piradnello作席滌塵譯</p>
<p>穿過靠近馬槽的横木窗，太陽曬了進來，映射在看來不像再是人面的臉龐上：浮腫一塊，鼻子也不見了；嘴唇是黑而脤起。透出的痰聲越發加强，像煞嘷呌。髪曲烏黑的頭髪裹，有根稻草在太陽光裹閃亮。</p>
<p>三個人見這光景，彷彿爲恐怖所却退，嚇得突然止步望着他。騾子蹄聲雜沓地踏在馬棚的圓石地上。於是隡羅走上垂死人的身邊去，親密地喚道：</p>
<p>「吉拉，吉拉，醫生來了。」</p>
<p>耐利將騾子去擊在馬槽上；近處墻上，好像有另一頭牲口的影子。原來是：住在馬棚裹的驢子的影像，因爲不住的動擦而印畫在墻上。</p>
<p>柴魯聽得第二次喚，才停止喉間的痰聲。他竭力睜開他那充满恐懼，己經昏暗的，發炎的眼來，又張開那可怕的嘴而呻吟，好好像裹面在燃燒。</p>
<p>「我要死了！」</p>
<p>「不會，不會。」薩羅痛苦萬分，趕緊回答。「醫生在這裹，我們請了來的；你也看見他嗎？」</p>
<p>「把我帶到村子裹去！」柴魯說時艱難也懇求，不能够把嘴唇合攏來。「啊，好上帝」</p>
<p>「好，你看，騾子在這裹，」隡羅立刻回答。</p>
<p>「要如非如此不可，就是抱在我懐裹，吉拉，我也　把你帶到村子裹去！耐利跑過來傴身向他說道。一不要怕！」</p>
<p>柴魯聽得耐和的聲音旋過頭來，彷彿起初不認得他一般，用那雙發炎的眼睛針望着他，於是移動一隻手臂，抓住了耐利的腰帶。</p>
<p>「孩子，是你？」</p>
<p>「我？當然是我！你在哭？不要哭，吉拉，不要哭！這是不要什麽緊的！」</p>
<p>耐利就放一隻手顫動着嗚咽的胸口上，可憐嗚咽不能打他喉嚨裹透發出來。於是柴魯哽咽住，發猛地摇頭，舉起一隻手，拘住耐利的頭頸，拖向自己去。</p>

<h3 id="c273">苦悶的解脫 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>現世的靑年，無論是有職業的和没職業的，都有一種極普遍的共通毛病，就是苦悶。這固然是一種時代病，舉世的紛擾，社會的黑暗，人情的陷落，都在那裹連環的傷刺着靑年們的心。在這些情况之下，事實上是不容你不陷入苦悶。</p>
<p>靑年是熱情的，是赤血的，正如「桃李刧」裹的陶建平一樣，他敢說敢做，爲了正義，可以犧牲自己，不顧其他。而現實的社會，却恰恰與這相反，願，靑年的苦悶，大多就從此開始。</p>
<p>這責任是應劃歸社會負的。不過也還有大部分的靑年，他們所有的苦悶，其來源並非如此，他們一到社會上混了若干時候，一切的一切，他們也覺得無所謂了，可是苦悶之幕却仍罩着他們每個的心，而且很深致地。這就需要從自身上來求解答了。</p>
<p>靑年一陷入苦悶，其危險不僅止於苦悶進而到悲觀，由悲觀進而到消極，自棄，再進而到墮落，自殺，這是難免的趨勢。一個靑年到了此種地步，其危險可知。這不僅是靑年本身的犧牲，尤是社會的世大損失。</p>
<p>這就需要補救了。着眼到大處方面說，固然又是社會問題，然而自身方面也確有嚴密檢察力圖振㧞的必要。這是一個本位問題，有多少人深陷於苦悶的處璄，但他終能運用合理的方法，將自己平安的渡過去，逹到成功的彼岸。什麽是解脫苦悶的方法，據我看，唯一的辦法是我們的精禔要有所寄托。</p>
<p>基督徒都是心曠神怡，和尙也都心廣體胖，這是將精神寄托予宗教信仰的功效。隱者名士寄情於山水垂釣，飲酒賦詩，然後他們的苦悶也就解脫了。自古以來，多少文學家科學家，凡是精神有所寄托的，無不愉快的過着他們的生活，造詣來得格外高深，否則，終日愁眉不展苦過一世，嘗不到一點兒人生的甜蜜的滋味。關於精神的寄托，袁中郎在他致友李子髯的一封信裹闡發得最透澈，茲特摘錄數語··以作結論··</p>
<p>「·······人情必有所寄，然後能樂。故有以弈爲寄，有以色爲寄，有以技爲寄，有以文爲寄。古之逹人，高人一層，只是他情有其寄，不肯浮泛虚度光景。每見無寄之人，終日忙忙，如有所失，無事而憂，對景不樂，卽自家亦不知是何緣故。這便是一座活地獄，更說甚麽鐵床銅柱，刀山劍樹也。查憐，可憐|·······</p>
<h3 id="c274">幻想 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 甲辰</p>
<p>人都要爲繽紛的現實生活所覊絆，而這種覊絆是誰也無法逃避的，同時現實之於任何人十之中八九個是不满，看做一種苦惱之綱，所有除了無言地忍任現實的襲擊之外，所能够暫時解除現實的累墮，而悠悠然於超現實的愉悅的境地的，就只有幻想，一件事，||也可以說是理想。故誰都喜歡親近幻想，幻想着後邊日子的光彩，幻想着將來會有燦爛的夢果。於是腦袋上站着無形的華麗的烏托邦，這樣地用着幻想的甜美來燙平現實的創痕，在幻想的上邊儘量塗着花彩，以使現實的各種悲哀遺忘掉。因此，幻想之存在是値得珍惜的，差不多没有人不把幻想認爲超過於一切親暱的伴侶，而不願意跟它片刻離開。你能够多與它接近一分鐘，便可以多獲得一分鐘的舒適和溫存，在這獲得的時間内，同時便是隔絶了現實的苦楚··倒過來，你無從多與幻想接近，卽將减去若干舒適和溫存的享受，而另一面却是多挨着若干現實的痛苦的磨折。</p>
<p>如像白天里忙碌得頭昏神迷，幾乎連停足的餘閑都没有，一天的糾緾實在累得心靈都麻木了。還談什麽愉快，况且在一天之間，繁擾的人事裹邊，往往會無端碰到了多樣的拂意的不高興的事件。到得晚上，一個懶腰身倒在床上，噓了一口長長的悶氣，而剛好這時候，幻想像一個满身佈着香味似的盛裝的女人，笑瞇瞇地輕盈地踩上你的心里邊，來作着甘甜的訪間了。於是你不自覺地微微的閉起了眼睛，像是淸醒却又像迷胡，就是在這一刹那間，那壓在你靈魂上的白日裹厚厚的生活的塵埃與困倦，己經一古腦兒全完脫落了。同時你就這樣陶醉在幻想的輕柔的摇籃中了。</p>
<p>所在現實的環境里遭逢到一些失望，或在精神上的不愉快，而又無法用人力來使之復時，唯一的方法就僅有求之於幻想的賜與了。凡是在現實的生活上所不能尋獲到的東西，無論是怎樣稀貴的東西，以至於永遠是一種夢的慾念，你都可以樣樣從幻想中求得幻想的確是人生心靈上瞬息不能分開的蘇息地，從而改移你對於毫無歡悞的現實生活的灰色之感，更從而堅强你之趣緻，加濃你生的依戀，而又鼓舞你向前邁步。</p>
<p>不過幻想却亦不得太過無邊無際，最適當是傍着現實的邊沿緩緩地伸引，若揆離現實過於遼遠，遼遠到有如海空的雲霞那麽渺茫。則永久地幻想就是幻想而己，不容易會結成現實的碩果的。那麽一輩子老是幻想，必將一輩子老是感到空洞，這樣，所有的幻想全成泡影，來無踪去無跡，到結局只是打心裹邊留下一道淡近似裝惘的靑烟而己。</p>
<p>因此幻想雖爲人生一種心靈上輕鬆的摇籃，但亦要有份量，過於虚無涉茫，將不特由此失掉了幻想的溫存和舒適，或者還會反而引起無限的懊喪來，旣己受盡現實的災患，尙且要因幻想而感到悲哀，那就更難受了。故此沉於幻想是可以的，但不要完全和自己的實際生活以及能力各走極端，而如爬山似的，先估計自己的氣力，另後一步一步的走上去，爬不得的時候就停止，别依然勉强的再爬。因爲萬一跌下來不是玩的。幻想亦如此，幻想得三神山那麽可望不可及終究還是苦惱的。</p>
<h3 id="c275">培明女中公演觀後 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>雖是隆冬天氣，各校的公演却是很熱烈的。約翰，光華，智仁勇，兩江，國華諸劇社的相繼公演，所得到的效果也許很微薄，可是，至少是劇壇的一種活氣的表示。</p>
<p>這一次培明女中的公演，事前没有充分的時間籌備，倚賴了少數幾個人的努力，所得到的成績倒還很能使人惬意的。</p>
<p>爲了籌建校舍，分兩天公演，記者只看到了最後一天的節目。</p>
<p>除了受黎錦暉所影嚮的歌與舞以及小學生所表演的魔術而外，這裹公演了比較有意義的三齣戲。日塲是（一）午飯之前（二）壓迫（三）黄浦江畔，晚塲只演了後二者。成功的只是這後二個戲。</p>
<p>因爲都是舊的戲，在這裹似乎用不到再講到劇本本身了。</p>
<p>從演臺上比較起來，「壓迫」是勝過於「黃浦江畔」的。在「壓迫」裹，因了故事的趣味，和演員的優秀，很能抓住觀衆的情緒。</p>
<p>飾女房客的沈如琛和飾男房客的李璧華演來非常努力，豐富的演劇天才和流利淸晰的對白更是這一個劇本成功的最大原由。特别是沈如琛並未經過幾次的排練而有這麽大的功績，該是値得我們驚異的。李璧華說話時每每把舌頭伸出口外，這是一個小的毛病。飾老太太的湯人良和飾老媽的胡蘭芝都能與劇中人物的身份相合，張才飾的警察，平時常揷入袋内，這也是一個缺點。夜裹的一塲是比日塲更完满一些。</p>
<p>其次是「黃浦江畔」我的决見以爲這一齣歌劇是不十分遍合於女學生們飾演的。這雖然近乎主觀，但是，一方面因爲這一個劇本裹存在着的一種碼頭工人們的粗獷的風格，雖不是絶對不能表違出來，但至少是會减一點色的。</p>
<p>第二個原因是這裹的碼頭工人們的苦痛的呻吟，生的呼號，怨楚的歌嘆，雄壯的呌喊是該唱Ｂase的，而在這裹却成了問題。就因了這樣，也就影嚮到了整個劇本的演出。演員都很平均，但不够認眞，飾老頭的鄭森蘭比較好一些。</p>
<p>至於「午飯之前」，由於冗長的對白，加以排練的疎生，這一個劇本演出所收到的效果是遜於「壓迫」和「黃浦江畔」的。演員對於小動作都不十分注意，比較可取的是飾三妹的沈愛珍。</p>
<p>一切的缺點是掩蓋不住這次公演的成續的，至少我們發現了很多有演劇天才的姑娘，爲這個劇壇的將來增加了一分希望。</p>

<p>冬來秋去，冬去春來，就這麽　環着，永恒的。</p>
<p>說起來也眞快，一臍眼，這一年又混混沌沌地過去了，跟做夢一樣，夢境裹的情形是什麽？這，在當時是淸楚的，過後呢？答不出，留給自己的，是一面輕薄的紗一樣的網子呵！</p>
<p>網子不管是怎樣的輕薄，然而，不可否認的是那額角上的皺紋在增多了，加深了·對着鏡子，自己想着·「呵，你這游子的心弦啊，企望麽？你的臉色在帶着你灰色的命運跨上了墓邊了·不禁的，心頭湧着一陣咽酸，行到喉端又哽住了。</p>
<p>不是嗎。新年的街頭　熱閙的，那一羣擁動着的，是數不淸的人頭哟！</p>

<p>這是快活的姿熊呢？但誰又能肯定着這里面没有辛酸的眼涙呢！</p>
<p>本來，一到了這種時候，我就得想法子躱開，要不然，那債主的不同的面孔可眞够受。但今年，我没有躱，我覺得那不同的臉是可愛的，那典型的神氣又何必躱避牠呢？</p>

<p>有人說，南國是樂園，因爲在南國里的氣候，景色，等等都給予人們以欣快的氣氛和感覺。</p>
<p>這話是不錯的，我認爲。不是麽？雖則在寒冷的冬天，然而江南的萊圃，舉竟是綠油油地，雖說溪邊的垂柳己經乾枯了，但畢竟河溪還在鄰鄰地流動呵！</p>
<p>於此，我懐念着别離了七年的北國。</p>
<p>實在，北與南畢竟有極明顯的不同的，在北國，現在己到了結冰的時候，不，紛飛着的大雪怕也要没脛了。</p>
<p>雖說北國的暮氣沉沉，但牠是有獨特的風趣的，在大雪飄後，在厲風撲面的季候里，那漪瀾堂前的冰塲，不是有一大批的男女在蹓行着麽？在化着種種地樣子哄笑着麽？可是，這北國的風趣喲！多快，一轉眼，又離别了七年啦！</p>
<p>懐念緊緊地埋藏着。</p>
<h3 id="c277">談殺生 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 戈白</p>
<p>過年了，家家殺雞殺鴨，忽然心血來潮，想起豐子愷先生的護生集，是那年常年茹素唸經的姑母託我買了從郵局寄回去的，我姑丈中年夭壽，一個遺腹子養不到二歲也是一命歸天，姑母怨自家的命運不好，發誓常年茹素唸經，自贖前　。並且每年上杭州普陀，朝山進香，出家人　上捐簿來，没有摇過頭。放魚放蛇，更唸了一種什麽經，說是以後再不會被捕了。這般苦心孤旨，到去年還是從佛樓上跌下來追先夫於泉下，當她送醫院的途上，那串唸佛珠依舊緊，緊握着據說斷氣後，就移不下來。想起那册護生集，不免唸「阿門」不止。</p>
<p>今年有兩次赴宴：（一）結婚，（一）彌月，都是素席。前者的主人是個大慈善家，他說不願爲了自己兒子的結婚而戮殺了許多生靈，一半爲自己的子孫造福，一半爲賓客的子孫造福，這聲明赢得許多歌頌公德的謟詞，及許多戒殺放生終得好報的故事於是賓主歡盡而散。後者是老年得子，而且是從什麽名山的送子觀音前求子得來的。他同樣說不願爲了自己一個三十天的孩子而戮殺不少生靈，於是許多黑魚報恩等故事我又洗耳恭聽了一次。</p>
<p>當時我確被感動了的，使想想殺鷄殺鴨時的殘酷影像，惑善家之流自然聞其聲不忍食其肉了！</p>
<p>不過自己没有投得好爺娘，又不會施展或種手段括錢，要生活自己，也得被人宰殺不可，這一點點引起來的感動能否蒙了假面具來談戒殺放生呢！</p>
<p>而且讀讀報又看到「易子而食」的新聞，雖没有親眼目覩，但祗要像殺鷄殺鴨一樣的推想起來，那許多能喊一媽媽，爹爹，」的孩子總比「喔喔喔，呷呷呷，」的呼聲更進一步，未知提倡戒殺放生及爲子孫造福的慈善家作何感想？</p>
<p>心血來潮終於祇是心血來潮，爲了慶幸自己這一年來的心血腦力未被壓榨殆盡，廚房中己經刀聲刮刮预備宰一鷄來吃一頓比較豐盛的晚餐，我再没有餘閑去暼一眼那隻被稻草縛着雙脚而在地上掙扎的大雄鷄了！</p>

<p>— 野菲</p>
<p>這幾天晚上時常失眠，不知爲了什麽緣故？我自己也不明白，睡在床上翻來覆去的眞是痛苦到了極點：早晨却又頭暈腦脹的爬不起來。但是爲了生活，也只好起來勉强去掙扎，然而終打不起精神，食無味，聽無聞，一天到晚昏昏沉沉的。</p>
<p>我自己拿鏡子來一照，覺得幾天以來面上的肉己經削去了不少，兩顆没有神的眼珠子也深深地陷進了眶子裹面；臉色是慘白得可怕！不禁把手裹的鏡子扔在地下嘆了一口冷氣，猛可地把一個死樣的肢體擲到了床上。</p>
<p>妻看了我很躭心，却又不敢向我多問，生怕我發脾氣。她幾次的問我可要看先生，我總是把頭摇摇，含含糊糊的没有一句回答。她很耐悶，不明白我究竟生的是什麽病？前天，她終於偸偸地去給我請了一個醫生來，我也不置可否。他給我診了脈，說我是心神不寧，祇要安心靜養，少受刺激，那慢慢地就會好的。但是｜剪斷思路我却實在有些困難，這幾天非但不能安心靜養，而且更胡思亂想得厲害起來了。所以我的病非僅没見减輕，甚至它正在向更深的領域内行進！昨天周醫生也來给我打了一個方子，我看到他臉上很憂鬱；後來他只輕輕的對我妻講了幾句話：</p>
<p>「他這病須好好的靜養，假使照這樣下去是很危險的···」但却給我聽得很淸晰，我可不怕死，最討厭的是半死半活的活着，我更不願安心靜養，我雖想活，却又没法阻止死神的來到，不過，當我這顆心還能够想，還能够跳動的時候，仍要想的跳的；自然，等到它不會想，停止跳了，那才一切都完了完了！</p>
<p>做人有什麽味兒？牛馬還不如的生活，機械一樣的生命！世界是那樣不平的，勢利的，人類是那樣冷酷的，殘忍的；一切一切的遭遇，都是些猙獰面目張牙舞爪的吸血鬼，我的血己經給牠吸乾了，我感到我的週遭都己張满了恐懼的網！</p>
<p>我才深深地覺得過去的事一個夢，是一個噩夢！現在的還依舊是個夢，而未來的怕不一樣是一個夢！</p>
<p>人生的夢交織成了一個網，一個密密的心網，來兜住了我這顆心，綳得很緊，它不會跳顫，更不會啟閉；失眠症却依然一天加重一天，到了晚上，那心網更收縮得厲害，是以我終於不能睡，但是爲了死前一刻延挨，還是少不了生活，所以又不得不勉强起來掙扎！</p>

<p>— 季子</p>
<p>一個峭寒，陰沉的黃昏·我自個兒抱着一顆給生活鬱悶襲擊着的心兒，走到一位七年不相見的故鄕朋友寓所裹。</p>
<p>進門·在一間狹小潔雅的樓房裹·蒼白色的燈光底下·我和這位久别的朋友·緊緊地握着手·相視着·不言語。一會兒元後·他一隻手搭上我的肩，一隻手順了順吊在他兩邊臉頰上的長髪。親密與驚訝地說：</p>
<p>｜啊唷，你長到這麽大啦！差點兒不認識······臉子太憔悴·太······晤·你怎麽生活的？</p>
<p>我們在一面緊接壁頭·一面靠近書桌的床沿上坐下來。喝峨眉茶·嗑瓜子·暢談着各個人别後的一切·又愉快·又哀怨地。後來談到近幾年來的故鄕··從預徵到民國八十年的糧稅·談到老百姓怎樣地反對繳納今年新起的「感情捐」，從種雅片烟談到「黑化」·「腐化」·「赤化」三種勢力的消長·大地主的没落下來做煟館的堂倌，種田人餓飯·做乞丐·開嗎啡廠的發大財··</p>
<p>｜｜有人說：「從前重慶城裹濃厚的工廠煤烟臭·此刻給雅片烟的香氣壓倒了。」我们城裹也是那麽一個樣子嗎？｜｜我橫躺在床上·有意無意地問。</p>
<p>｜｜自然没有兩樣囉，哦·今年夏天倒有幾天鼻孔裹停止了裝塞這般烏烟瘴氣｜｜他記憶地說着。</p>
<p>我很詫異了·坐起來喝了口茶。</p>
<p>｜｜怎麽？又是某軍長捉拿烟鬼去上絞刑呀？</p>
<p>他抿着嘴兒·苦笑了一下。</p>
<p>｜｜什麽鬼軍長·你不知道四川是個邪魔地麽！</p>
<p>我迫切地要求他告訴我這到底是怎麽一回事·他皺了皺眉兒唉聲歎氣地說</p>
<p>｜｜就是這麽的：據說陰歷六月十九那天·我們縣裹來了一個奇奇怪怪的老呌化婆·别人打發她的錢·不要·米也不要·什麽都不要·只是沿街喊呌着·勸人馬上戒除吸雅片·後來她又跪在一家烟店門口·口口聲聲勸人莫吸·還說不聽勸·不戒烟的人·通通都活不過七月半······後來烟店老闆·深怕恐駭走了他的買客·出來趕走老呌化婆·可是她呢·頑固地堅持不走·終於給老闆踼了一脚·登時不知逃到那兒去了，後來</p>
<p>說到這兒·一下子停住·他好像不願多說這些鬼鬼怪怪的荒謬事情似地盯住面前的瓜子锰兒不言語了·我着急地追問：</p>
<p>｜｜後來怎麽樣呢？說完啦！</p>
<p>他　了我一眼·低聲說：</p>
<p>｜｜第二天下午·踢了呌化婆一脚的那個烟店老闆突地發痧死了。於是有人大驚小怪地造謡說昨天的老呌化婆是觀音菩薩的化身·老闆侮辱了菩薩·所以遭了報應······一下子通城裹外都轟動起來·全城所有的「售店」｜｜烟店｜｜通通憇業關門·所有的烟户都把吸烟具收藏起來·有的還拿來燒燬！後來縣衙門裹因爲收不着烟厘金大起恐慌·這兒·衙門裹出了告示：不凖一般人妖言惑衆······防害治安就這機·不到十天工夫·那些烟鬼子，不是又開始吸了嗎！</p>
<p>我打了一個大哈哈·他也笑了。</p>
<p>寒風中·帶着興奮的·依戀不忍分手的心兒别了朋友出來。踏上回家的道路，現刻記憶的幕布上還映着··</p>
<p>｜｜······四川是個邪魔地······</p>
<p>這幾個字兒·我不懂人們爲什麽要給妖魔迷住·至今還不覺醒起來！</p>

<h3 id="c285">電影發逹的簡史（一） <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 文瀛</p>
<p>（一）觀衆是造就影業的主人翁</p>
<p>觀衆們，電影事業是你們的事業。電影事業之所以能到現在發逹的地步，是你們造就的。觀衆們的喜悅或憎惡，就是企業家所遵守的法律。從電影的最初期，幾個「無聊之輩」凑了幾個錢，購置了組笨的電影放映機器，在破舊的空屋子裹，摇出了跳動的幢幢往來的人影之後，一直到現在不可備述的盛况，觀衆們始終是電影事業的迭克推多，統治者。</p>
<p>在一千九百年的時，無論誰提起了活動影片，都會笑起來的。他們自命爲有知識的人，不屑考慮那種無謂之事的。銀行家聽說有人要向他們借資本，做影戲事業，他們都掩耳不聞。有幾個貧寒的人，凑集了他們半生的積蓄，向電影事業投資，他們的朋友都說他們是瘋子。但是到了那一天，大家都跑到一間破舊的屋子裹，去看活動影片。他們看見了影片的確會跳動的，大家都奇怪起來。他們親眼看見火車向着他們面前走過來。他們親眼看见一個帶着髪捲的女孩子，使他們一回兒爲她而啼泣，一回兒又使他們破涕爲笑。那就是後來世界聞名的曼麗璧克馥。那上一輩子的人，看見了那種粗糙跳動的影片，覺得很有趣味。他們於不知不覺地之中就鞠育了一個大企業的開始，因爲垣街的大銀行家，知道他們喜觀看那種東西，亦就放鬆了錢袋的繩，而開始向電影事業投資了。所以，電影事業，打草創的時候起，就是屬於電影觀衆的。</p>
<p>在差不多一九二三年的時候，美國的影片事業己經很發逹了，梁高文（Ｓamuel　Goldwyn）有一次召集了美國最有名的報界和雜誌界影評者，給了他們很優厚的薪水，請他們在影片尙未公映之前，評判它們的優劣。結果，那種嘗試完全失敗了，因爲他們認爲好的，觀衆們不喜歡看，而他們所認爲不好的，觀衆們倒歡迎起來。由此可知，觀衆們的意旨，不是任何專家可以來指揮的。如果一個企業家化去了無數的金錢，將一個明星捧了出來，觀衆們看了喜歡，並且告訴他們的朋友，大家都說好，那個企業家的錢，就不是白化的。不然的話，觀衆們祇要略爲縐一縐眉頭，那個明星就立刻站不住，而企業家的錢，亦就等於擲在水裹了。售票處的收入，就是好萊塢惟一的估計明星們價値的標準，而那個標準，就是觀衆們大家掏腰包買票的時候决定的。</p>
<p>所以，你們大家觀衆們，就是影片事業的主人翁，而影片事業，却並不是什麽平常的事業它是美國六大企業中的一個。但是在别的事業中，你們的地位，却並没有這樣重要，無論是在鋼鐵業，棉紗業或絲業之中。因爲電影業是你們自己的事業，所以知道些電影事業怎樣開始的，怎樣發逹的，什麽人是電影史中的功臣，以及三十年以來的簡略沿革，一定是於你們很有益的。或者亦是很有趣味的，因爲電影的歷史，是富有光榮和羅曼斯的。其中有生動活躍的人物，成功失敗的經過，傷心失望的悲怨，以及得意忘形的享樂。我們處於現代的地位，可以廻顧一下，將己往的陳跡，聯合組織起來，但是我們的前驅者，是没有向前看的先覺的。這就是我們現代人處境優越的地方。（未完）</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Oliver　Twist｜國泰｜</p>
<p>在「獄底餘生」之後，這裹又是一部迭更斯的小說搬上銀幕。</p>
<p>關於迭更斯（Dickens　Eliztaebh）,在我寫一獄底餘生」時，曾經說過，現在用不着介紹，他雖然不是十分偉大的作家，但中國讀者，他對却很熟悉。至於這一「孤兒流浪記」曾經有林琴南的譯本，名爲「賊史」。而且在默片時代，「孤兒流浪記」乃是給與人們以很深的印象的。</p>
<p>文學作品搬上銀幕，我們曾經一再指出，這除了說明美國電影的題材的缺乏之外，更主要的理出是某些文學作品還能够吻合着二十世紀，三十年代的製片者的主觀的要求，譬如說，由於現階段的經濟基礎之急速的崩潰，流浪街頭，無家可歸的小孩，在每一個都市中都是整千累萬的充塞着。當然他們是要生活下去的，他們除了乞食或者是偷竊之外，乃是没有其他生活方法的。這一現象，在社會人士看來，當然是一種隱憂，然而他們是没有方法求得徹底之解决的，於是改良主義便是他們唯一的手段，於是英國改良主義的迭更斯的作品，便一再被人們搬演着了。</p>
<p>現在我們更進一步的從「孤兒流浪記」本身來探討迭更斯的作風罷，雖然這是通過了，Ending　Mechan的編劇，不容易完全窺探小說作品的面貌。</p>
<p>和所有的改良主義者一樣，迭更斯看到了當時社會高貴者羣的殘暴或缺乏同情心，這在小孩奥里夫向坐馬車的紳士討錢不能得着一個便士，以及他在孤兒院中想再要一碗湯，結果得着的是兇暴的刑罰，更在孤兒院中訊問奥里夫的時候，將那高高在上者一羣浸畫化的諷刺，無一不是作者的憤恨。</p>
<p>同樣迭更斯也極力厭惡竊賊的一羣，如奥里夫之被毒打，如賊首比耳西克斯之殘暴等等，雖然他是變態心理描寫着他們，對於他們爲生活所逼，給與了若干程度的同情。那末在這觀察之下，迭更斯便提出了自己的主觀見解，那便是在富人之羣中他化裝了奥里夫的外祖父而出現，在竊賊羣中，他特别加重描寫比耳西克斯之妻的存心忠厚與仁慈。最後，那個流浪着的小孩到底得救子。如上所述的主題，對於美國製片者眞是太適合了。</p>
<p>可是在電影的表現上，從那一方面說都很不够。導演開始的幾塲戲，做得很好，以後的高潮也還可以，但是在好多地方，並没有表現出來。假使說那主人公的小孩是很可憐的話，那末，這必須加上觀衆的想像，才能理會得到，導演並不能給與觀衆直接的刺戟。當然這裹也可看到小孩兒的演技並不純熟，同時其他的劇中人，如兩個較大的小賊，都是不自然的表演。不過那囚犯的老頭兒和那大賊的個性，却是寫得相當生動的。至於沉悶晦澀，自然也是不免的結果了，</p>
<h3 id="c287">評義俠情侶 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>"The　Trail　Drlve"|卡爾登</p>
<p>以美洲西部廣大原野中的純朴剛毅的牧人生活爲素材，編織入一個義俠而加上一些愛情的穿揷，製作成的劇本，在影片的無聲時期就是慣見的了。直到聲片發逹的現在，于妖蕩的爵士歌舞，紙醉金迷的都市風光，華貴頽靡的享樂生活等演出之外，取材如上述那些靜穆朴質的農村背景，沉着潑刺的牧人故事，製作而成的也很多。可惜的只是其中較好的却很少。</p>
<p>其實，在這全地球六分之五的地方，都淪陷於動盪不安中的近年，經濟恐慌，牧畜，屠塲與皮革各業也同遭浩刦的時期，那些牧人們生活於原始的生産方式與新興的不景氣中間，凄厲的目前遭受，回首前塵往事，亦儘多可歌可泣，驚心怵目的現實故事，可以製成極好的影片的，只是限於製作者的觀點與手法，所以不是空想地從幻想中去找劇情，就是强調着男女的糾紛或個人的英雄事略，以致俗套或失實地出産些庸俗的作品。</p>
<p>這「義俠情侶」也是不能例外。他寫經濟凋落，農民的牲口無人問津，約翰｜牲畜商人｜雖然有意購買，但是銀行中拒絶給他信用借欵。</p>
<p>接着用約翰向牧人提議，先出債劵，待到牲口在新墨西哥地方賣脫之後，再給現錢，牧人於無可奈何中，只得同意了這些過程，以及約翰勾結州長先發出售證，吞吃欵項，不認債劵這一計謀來展開劇情，更爲可取的。</p>
<p>可是這「義俠情侶」的編導Alan　Jain怎樣理解與處置他從現實中抓取得的問題呢？他不從這一現象下廣大的牧人者羣的生活掙扎方面來走向劇本的「頂點」上去，完成他的傑作。他從牧人中找出一個「天性旣忠直而又俠義，供職在約翰牧塲，爲他看護牲口與押隊去出賣的甘彭頓」來爲牧人，爲自己的愛人｜薇琴妮｜來拚命地從約翰身上逼出錢付牧人應得的牲口錢。</p>
<p>先就甘彭頓旣是天性忠直，怎麽會倒他主人的戈這一點上說，在畫面上看不到充份的適當的過程，只見「神乎其人」的在力，敵幾十個流氓，刀槍不入地在槍林彈雨中大扛出乎，「檀溪躍馬」地跨懸崖，涉大河，回馬槍百發百中等誇張到神話中去。它用敵人會把他綑綳在門上，讓掙下門板來背着門板從窗中跌下來落在兩匹馬上把他馱着走，以及約翰悔罪等太巧合與非現實的演出，己經把全劇凌空到幻虚境内了，那堪再來一個「河畔定情」的戀愛尾巴，而落了平庸陳舊的Ｈappy　Endingm的俗套呢！</p>
<p>在演出方面，一般地說來，是没有脫去武俠愛情片的舊式。一部分寫牧人生活的畫面上，倒有少可取之處，如原野中的賬幕，牛羣，棚車，河流，雲月，風塵等自然的風景，與原始性生活的習尙等寫得極純樸，柔和，簡潔，美麗，民俗歌謡，與舞踊的幾個塲面，也採取與處理得頗爲可愛。</p>
<p>演技除了演甘彭頓的Ｋen　Maynard以武俠明星的牌頭上塲，打出手與騎馬的本領外，以演壞商人約翰的Ｗillia　Gould爲較好。牧人的憂急，氣憤，歡樂等表情，與流氓等的羣衆的演出，倒頗見導演者者之用心的。</p>

<p>— 信之</p>
<p>本埠新聞編輯走了之後，密契爾正要看幾張别的稿子，他的秘書走了進來，他神色張皇，面色灰白，如同看見了鬼似的。他告訴密契爾道：「外面有一個人要見你，他的名字呌丹奥立佛。他不肯說見你什麽事情，不過我······我······我看他那副面目，怪兇惡的。」密契爾靠在椅子背上，他的臉色狐疑不决起來。一回兒他毅然地道：「呌他進來！」</p>
<p>丹奥立佛進來了。他是一個身材瘦小的人，頭髪灰白，憂容满面，顯露着他内心燃燒的猛烈，使他兩目深陷，顴骨高聳起來。密契爾瞪著兩隻眼睛看著他，心裹覺得侷促不安。他看著丹奥立佛揷在衣袋裹的一隻手。他想倘使他將那樣害怕了。但是他不。他的手一動不動的對著他。密契爾於是開他道：「你要見我嗎？」那人道：「你是總主筆，密契爾先生嗎？」密契爾道：「不錯的，我就是。」那人道：「我是丹奥立佛。你的報上要登載我的一段新聞。我請你不要登載。請你給我一個機會，讓我償還我所虧空的錢。」他的乾澀的聲音，顯出他内心焦急的情狀。密契爾慢慢地摇着頭道：「對不起。現在己經來不及了。你盜竊了這許多錢，我的讀者是應當知道這件事的。」密契爾說着，丹奥立佛眼睛裹的涙水直流出來。他喊道：「爲了要满足一般讀者低的慾望，你就這樣將一個人的生命撕得粉碎嗎？」密契爾冷冷地道：「你在盜取那欵子之先，怎麽没有想到你的生命呢？我不過將眞實新聞供給我的讀者而己。」奥立佛咆哮起來道：眞實的新聞！眞實的新聞！你知道什麽叫眞實的新聞！你天天拿姦淫虜掠的新聞，舖張揚勵地供給社會上一般知識淺薄的人。現在我亦做了你的犧牲品，爲了你要有一個大字的標題，聳動聳動人家的耳目，就將我一生的生路斬斷了。」密契爾坐在大椅子裹，裝作鎭靜的態度道：「奥立佛，這個間題我們不用再討論下去了。」</p>
<p>奥立佛的態度，忽然變成獰惡的樣子。他走上一步，將衣袋裹的槍口對準了密契爾恨恨的道，「好吧！我再給你一個大標題｜｜一年之中最大的標題。我站在這裹，等你的報紙出版。要是裹面登載了我的事情，我不在你身上打幾個窟窿，我就不算是人！」密契爾還是聲色不動的靠在椅子背上。他很鎭靜地看着他面前的人，但是他的腦筋，却在急劇地運用着。他面前的人，但是一個兇徒。他是抱着决心而來的，那是無可疑異的。但是他旣然不採取急劇的行動，他還有時間可以調佩他，愚弄他一下。這時奥立佛正站在門口，背向着開着的門。密契爾靜待着時機，再作道理。但是他從門口往外一張，他的一顆心都沉下去了。</p>
<p>原來他的女兒瓊，穿着一襲新衣，　　婷婷地走了進來，她一進來，就喊道：「哈囉，爸爸，給我幾個錢。」那是她的常態，活是一位嬌生慣養的千金小姐。她忽然看見一個生人，站在她的身後。她嚇了一跳，然後說道：「哦，對不起，我等一回再來吧。」奥立佛將手槍掏了出來指着她道！「不錯的。你等着吧。在這裹等。」瓊瞟了他一眼，然後姗姗走到她父親的背後站着。這時密契爾的臉色，更加靑白了。瓊，他的女兒，亦和他同在危急萬份之中了。倘使這個瘋人開槍轟擊起來，豈不父女二人同歸於盡嗎。忽然他桌上的電話鈴響了。密契爾看着奥立佛的臉，似乎問他能聽不能聽。（未完）</p>

<p>Two Offices Can Be Established Tomorrow</p>
<p>Huang Ziguo Claims to Be a Retired Postal Worker</p>
<p>Applying to Undertake the Business in a Private Capacity</p>
<p>The Huitong Transfer Bureau for Beiping, Yuguan, and Gubeikou,</p>
<p>Has been under the responsible preparation of Huang Ziguo, the manager of the bureau. The two bureaus are scheduled to open simultaneously on the 8th. According to postal circles, the transfer bureau has absolutely no relationship with the post office. The transfer bureau is a privately run business, similar in nature to the private letter offices. According to postal regulations, in areas where the post office cannot deliver letters, a transfer bureau may be established to be responsible for the transfer, similar to the nature of postal agencies in various towns and villages. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After the opening of postal services to Tianjin, the authorities decided to continue handling mail from inland China to Xinjiang, as they have already signed a transport contract with the Xin Sui Automobile Company. There is no need to have it transferred through a pseudo-national postal route via Northwest Siberia to save costs and procedures. The Huitong Transfer Bureau will be established on the 8th, with the main office in Shanhaiguan and a branch office in Gubeikou, all under the responsibility of Huang Ziguo. The expenses of the bureau will be offset by a 1% commission on money orders. Huang Ziguo and Yu Xianglin, the contractor for this matter, are both in Tianjin and will go to Shanhaiguan together on the 7th. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yu Xianglin of Tianjin stated that he came here to inspect the postal situation and the progress of the opening of postal services. He will go to Shanhaiguan with Huang Ziguo in the next few days, stay for about one or two days, and then go to Beiping to negotiate with the Beiping postal authorities. This matter was negotiated before April, with Yu and Gao Zhongwu as representatives, negotiating with representatives of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and was not officially handled by the Ministry. After the opening of postal services, any mail with place names in the four northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, etc., will be transferred. Any mail with pseudo-organization wording will be refused. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huang Ziguo of Tianjin stated that after the decision on the opening of postal services, he, in a private capacity, applied to the Hebei Postal Bureau to undertake all postal and remittance matters inside and outside the customs, and established the Huitong Transfer Bureau. The postal authorities, because he was a retired employee and familiar with postal affairs, approved his request. Therefore, the procedure only requires signing a contract with the Hebei Postal Management Bureau and paying a deposit of ten thousand yuan. All mail from outside the customs must have a special stamp without pseudo-national characters. If stamps with pseudo-national characters are mistakenly affixed, the transfer bureau will compensate for the loss. A 1% commission will be charged for handling remittances, which will be used for losses and expenses. Once the handling is satisfactory and the number of mistakenly affixed pseudo-stamps decreases, the amount of the deposit will be reduced accordingly. The transfer bureau is entirely privately operated, and the personnel in the bureau are employed by Huang. It is planned to employ ten people in Shanhaiguan and two people in Gubeikou will be sufficient to handle the business. As for the contract, it has been generally agreed upon and can be signed in the next day or two. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hebei Postal Management Office of Tianjin has notified the post offices within its jurisdiction that they will uniformly accept mail, packages, and remittances to the four northeastern provinces starting from the 10th, but it must be indicated on the mail that it is to be transferred by the Gubeikou or Shanhaiguan Huitong Transfer Bureau in order to be valid.

<p>Xiao Zhenying Hosts Sun at a Banquet</p>
<p>Huang Fu Prepares to Go South</p>
<p>Sun Ke of Beiping went to the Western Hills for sightseeing this afternoon and did not return to the Beijing Hotel until 6:30 pm. Suo Wang and Zhagisqin had already arrived at the hotel to meet with him. After Sun returned, he immediately met with Suo Wang. At 7:00 pm, Song ordered Xiao Zhenying to represent him in hosting a banquet. Sun personally attended, accompanied by Yu Xuezhong, Wan Fulin, Suo Wang, and others. Suo Wang brought dozens of fine horses as gifts to Yuan Liang, Yu Jinhe, etc. on this trip to Beiping, and is now presenting another batch, including one for Sun Ke, two for Huang Fu, and one for Yu Jiaji. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong of Beiping stated that after arriving in Beiping yesterday, he visited President Sun for a general conversation. He will visit Huang again today, and tonight or tomorrow morning, he will return to Tianjin to host Sun. He will come to Beiping again in the next few days to visit the ministers and chargés d'affaires of various countries to exchange New Year's greetings. The joint office of the Hebei Provincial Government is in active progress and can be implemented in the shortest possible time. The order to abolish bureaus and merge departments in various counties has been issued and will be implemented as soon as the order reaches the counties. Although the situation in the counties in the war zone is special, they are also within the scope of Hebei Province, and the abolition of bureaus and merger of departments must be implemented simultaneously. In the future, after the abolition of bureaus and merger of departments, there will be no restrictions on the native place of officials in various counties. The claim that locals cannot serve as officials in their local areas is not true. The issue of the boundary between Hebei and Beiping will be handled in accordance with the principles decided by the provincial government. The claim that meetings will continue to be held in Beiping is inaccurate. The truth about the poor people's association in Ji County is unclear, and an investigator has been sent to investigate. At the same time, the county government has been ordered to arrest the ringleaders for interrogation to clarify the situation. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Huang Fu's scheduled date for going to Nanjing was originally the 10th of this month, but his departure has been postponed due to waiting to meet with a certain friend. According to sources, Huang's departure will be around the 14th, and he will mostly travel by plane. His wife and entourage will leave Beiping on the same day by the Beiping-Pukou train with an attached carriage. Sun Ke, because his wife's illness has recovered, has decided to leave Beiping tomorrow for a short trip to Tianjin. Sun originally intended to go directly to Nanjing, but due to Yu's insistence, he temporarily decided to stay in Tianjin for one night. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sun Ke of Beiping stated that he came to Beiping for sightseeing and had no special mission. After finishing his business in Beiping, and at the urging of Wang Liangchou, he has decided to leave Beiping tomorrow to attend the swearing-in ceremony of all members of the Legislative Yuan on the 14th. There may be a delay in Tianjin. After Huang was announced by the Central Government to concurrently hold the position of Minister of Interior, Huang suffered from illness and was unable to immediately go to Nanjing to take office. He has now fully recovered. He and Huang have met several times, and he will be able to go to Nanjing in the short term. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, has finished his sightseeing in Beiping. His wife's illness has recovered, and he has decided to take the train to Tianjin on the 7th for a one-day sightseeing trip, and then return south. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liu Guitang Bandit Gang</p>
<h3 id="e3">Flees Back to Miyun County <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Miyun Telephone, Liu Guitang's bandit gang of more than 400 people, previously fled to Huairou, Shayuli, and other villages. After being defeated by the security team, they fled to the border of Chahar. Now they have fled back to the Tanghekou area under the jurisdiction of Chengde, more than ten miles outside the Dashuiyukou of Miyun. Xu Shiying, the commander of the Second Security Brigade, urgently transferred Mu Zisan, the commander of the Fifth Security Company stationed in Miyun, to lead his team to Dashuiyu Niufengyu on the morning of the 6th. Liu Zhenhai, the commander of the Sixth Security Company stationed in Huairou, led his team to Hefengkou Changyuankou. Zhao Ruilin, the commander of the Seventh Security Company stationed in Shixia, led his team to Zhuanghetun to block the bandits. At noon on the 6th, 50 to 60 of Liu's bandits fled to Donggezhuang Town, north of Miyun City. Yang Weiting, the head of the Miyun Defense General Regiment, led the entire defense regiment to pursue and suppress them. The Yamaguchi Captain of the Japanese army stationed in Gubeikou, because Liu's bandits had already fled to the border of Jehol, also led more than 100 Japanese infantry and cavalry, with more than 20 pseudo-soldiers and four mountain cannons, to Tanghekou on the morning of the 6th to block and suppress them. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The bandits who once disturbed Miyun and Huairou in Beiping were suppressed by the stationed troops a few days ago and had fled out of Henglingkou to the border of Chahar Province. However, as a result of the Chahar army's blockade, the bandits are again thinking of fleeing back to Huairou via Hefengkou and Dashuiyu. Many security teams are now guarding Hefengkou and Dashuiyu to prevent them from fleeing back. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>A certain party has sent many people from Dolun to contact the Yang Monkey gang who are disturbing the border between Chahar and Suiyuan. The remnants of Liu Guitang's troops have fled from Hebei Province back to eastern Chahar and are now entrenched at the junction of Yanqing and Huailai.

<p>Tao Shangming left for Tianjin at 5:20 pm on the 6th and will return to Tangshan soon. According to him, the rotation of security teams in the war zone has been agreed upon after several discussions. The newly编(bian) security teams can enter the war zone after being reviewed by Zhu Shiqin. Because Zhu is feeling a little unwell, the date of the review has not yet been decided. The withdrawal and training locations of the old security teams are very difficult, and the authorities are still discussing this. The banditry in the war zone is due to the weakness of the police force, and it has been decided to find ways to strengthen the self-defense forces in the future, so it can be quiet. Zhao Dazhong, the instigator of the Tangshan workers' unrest, has now left the pass, and there will be no more incidents in the future.

<p>Nanjing, the Executive Yuan believes that the Judicial Yuan's interpretation of whether people can appeal in the case of dividing boundary lines is still doubtful and requests further interpretation. The Judicial Yuan's answer: The so-called administrative disposition that changes the original state of people's land refers to the new construction of ditches, roads, or embankments on people's land due to the division of boundaries. However, administrative disposition is not limited to changing the original state of the land. For example, if the water conservancy of Village A is assigned to Village B due to the division of village boundaries, causing damage to the people of Village A, then although the original state of the land has not been changed, it is an administrative disposition. The villagers who have suffered losses can file an appeal against it. A corresponding consultation is given for reference. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Prerequisite for Guaranteeing the Affairs Officials Ting <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the National Government approved the request of the Examination Yuan and instructed the directly subordinate agencies, roughly stating that affairs officials should not advance or retreat with political officials, and that qualified civil servants should not be dismissed without reason, so that they can serve the public with peace of mind and improve administrative efficiency. In addition to ordering the Legislative Yuan to draft the Civil Servant Guarantee Law, it should be followed uniformly, etc. We often feel that the corruption of our country's officialdom is half due to the careless selection of civil servants and half due to improper promotion and demotion. Therefore, fortunately, there is the support of powerful people, who can rise from the ground and soar straight up. Otherwise, even if there is extraordinary talent, they are mostly confined under the carriage and cannot fully display their talents, or even have the risk of being eliminated at any time. As a result, most high-ranking personnel hold the mentality of a five-day magistrate. The unscrupulous ones also think that it is difficult to hunt for an official position, and it is not easy to stay in office. Why not take this opportunity to search as much as possible, so as to make plans for a comeback after stepping down? The affairs personnel in lower positions are transferred with the advancement and retreat of their superiors. Since individuals have no guarantee of life, how can they arouse their interest in being loyal to their duties? The National Government, in view of this, had already issued an order to the whole country on March 1, 17th year, saying, "Recently, it has been found that various agencies often change their affairs officials with the change of political officials, not only far-reaching plans cannot be implemented, but also daily affairs are often suspended as a result. In the future, affairs officials should not be changed with political officials." On March 6, 20th year, another order was issued, saying, "Various agencies should not arbitrarily change or dismiss qualified incumbent civil servants who have been screened. This is for the sake of emphasizing selection and evaluation and eliminating opportunistic advancement. If various agencies need to reduce staff or change their organization and need to reduce staff, they should also distinguish the merits, qualifications, and length of service of each member as the standard for staying or leaving." If these two orders can be carried out vigorously and resolutely, the foundation of the modern examination and evaluation system can be laid down half of the time. Now that it is necessary to reiterate the previous orders in fact, we must have a more resolute determination to carry them out.</p>
<p>We have no way of guessing what the content of the Civil Servant Guarantee Law to be drafted by the Legislative Yuan will be. However, we believe that the biggest problem why affairs officials today do not have sufficient guarantees is that in fact, there are only passively prohibiting the arbitrary replacement of civil servants, and there are no actively punishing those who illegally appoint private individuals or exclude dissidents. Therefore, if the government sincerely wants to correct the long-standing malpractices, the first thing it should do is to impose sanctions on such illegal actions. According to the 198th meeting of the Central Political Conference and the third plenary meeting of the Third Central Executive Committee, all officials who must be appointed by the Political Conference or the State Council are political officials.</p>
<p>Appointed, recommended, and simple appointed personnel are affairs officials. The dismissal or other disciplinary sanctions of affairs officials shall be strictly in accordance with Article 2 and Article 15 of the Civil Servant Disciplinary Act, that is, affairs officials shall not be subject to dismissal, demotion, etc., unless they (1) violate the law, (2) neglect their duties, or other acts of dereliction of duty. The disciplinary agency shall also copy the original impeachment documents to the affairs officials who are subject to disciplinary action and designate a period for them to submit a written statement of defense. If necessary, they may also be ordered to attend the court for questioning. In the future, if political officials arbitrarily deprive their subordinate affairs officials of their positions or reduce their ranks and salaries without following this law and its prescribed procedures, they themselves are illegal. The Control Yuan should immediately file an impeachment case and evidence and send it to the Supervisory Committee of the Central Party Department or the National Government for disciplinary action according to their status. Only then can the status of affairs officials be fully guaranteed, and administrative efficiency can be greatly improved. Mussolini Laval Agrees on Central European Pact</p>
<h3 id="e43">Still Based on Maintaining Austria's Independence and Inviting Neighboring Countries to Participate African Issues Still Under Discussion <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Rome, Foreign Minister Laval and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini have reached an agreement on the Central European Pact after talks here today. It stipulates that if any country interferes with Austria's independence, France and Italy will consult with each other and invite all countries bordering Austria, including Germany, to sign a non-interference protocol. The full text of the treaty between France and Italy and a request for Romania and Poland to participate in the non-interference protocol. The two countries and other countries bordering Austria should mutually agree not to interfere in each other's internal affairs, not to initiate any acts of aggression, and not to assist the activities of any terrorist groups. After the full text of the agreement is approved by the French and Italian parties, it will be notified to the German government. It is expected that Germany will be invited to join the Central European Pact in the near future. It is reported that the United Kingdom is very willing to support the final resolution, as expressed in the friendly telegram sent by Foreign Minister Simon, but it does not seem to join the agreement,</p>
<p>After the French Foreign Minister and the Italian Prime Minister held their first talks, they met with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Suvich in the hotel at 5 pm. The French Foreign Minister told the visiting journalists that everything was proceeding smoothly. The talks with Mussolini this morning involved everything in the treaty.</p>
<p>The main difficulties that the French and Italian authorities must solve now are how to discuss with the German government and to what extent should Germany be invited to participate in the non-interference protocol. Another difficulty is the integration of the interests of the three countries of France, Italy and Argentina. Since the Uruel dispute between Italy and Argentina, this matter has been particularly difficult. However, today, the Italian King declared to the Argentine ambassador his willingness to be friendly and willing to make a peaceful understanding of the Uruel dispute. The situation has greatly improved as a result.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters telegram from Berlin, officials are not lightly speaking about the agreement reached by France and Italy. However, a government spokesman said regarding the non-interference in Austria's independence that many countries have already made practical statements to protect Austria's independence. This kind of agreement seems to weaken rather than strengthen the importance of the declarations of various countries, and is enough to cause the impression that the United Kingdom is not involved in the agreement. Regarding the proposal for a common agreement of non-interference, the spokesman also said that Berlin believes that this document involving Austria is too late to be issued as far as Germany is concerned, because Germany has tried its best to avoid any events that interfere with Austria, etc.</p>
<p>When the French Foreign Minister went to the Venice Palace to participate in Mussolini's banquet today, he delivered a speech on the spot, saying that peace is still in danger, but we have great hope and should not be discouraged. France should be concerned about its own security and also know how to participate in the integration of the opinions of various countries. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini once warned mankind in the new era of Italian history not to allow humanity to retreat into the dark ages, which is understood by many countries, etc. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini then declared that Italy and France are not only working together to manage bilateral agreements, but also will promote the common doctrine of the two countries. Italy and France are not seeking to deny the friendship between the countries of Central Europe, but are actually trying to reconcile the interests and needs of the countries and move towards the path of peace. Finally, he said that there is no problem of excluding any country. During the banquet, the French Foreign Minister presented the Italian Prime Minister with the Grand Cross of Honor, and the Italian Prime Minister also presented the French Foreign Minister with the Grand Cross of Saint Mauritius and Lazarus. The French Foreign Minister also participated in the reception of the French Embassy at 6:30 pm today. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, this morning, French Foreign Minister Laval and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini continued to talk for three hours. It is believed that what they discussed was mostly colonial issues, especially the acquisition of the status of Italian nationals in Tunisia and the construction of railways in Somalia. The talks were very friendly. Experts are now studying the pending cases and will present the results of their research to the French Foreign Minister and the Italian Prime Minister when the talks resume on Monday. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, the negotiations between Italy and France are still ongoing. Regarding the signing of an agreement to protect Austria's independence, Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval have reached a compromise. This agreement will be signed by France, Italy and countries whose territories are adjacent to Austria. The so-called countries with adjacent territories include the Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, Germany and Hungary. As for Romania and Poland, they will be invited to sign the agreement at a later date. As for the various issues in Africa, Italy believes that the concessions made by France are still insufficient. However, it is generally believed that a compromise can be reached tomorrow. This morning, Mussolini and Laval met for three hours. In the afternoon, French diplomats and Italian experts will complete the整理various document phrases. In the evening, French Ambassador Dang Berlan will host a banquet to welcome Laval and invite Mussolini to accompany him. It is generally believed that the talks between Laval and Mo tomorrow morning may have certain results. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris, Foreign Minister Laval made a speech to a Rome interviewer for the Order Newspaper, saying, "The impression I got from this negotiation in Rome is not only good, but also very good," etc. French newspapers commented on the Rome talks, saying that the situation is very good for the future cooperation between Italy and France and the advocacy of peace. For example, the Aix newspaper said that the past misunderstandings and estrangements between Italy and France can be compared to wax, and the sympathy shown by Laval and Mussolini can be compared to heat. Wax meets heat and there is no one that does not melt. This is not a miraculous miracle, but only the logic of the Latin nation's thoughts is in line with the logic, and therefore a victory is finally achieved, etc. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, French Foreign Minister Laval said to people that this agreement is very good, etc. According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris, the Paris Echo and other newspapers said that Germany's opposition to joining the agreement can be eliminated, as long as the agreement is divided into two parts. One is a memorandum, which stipulates that the countries that inherit Austrian territory, namely Poland, the Czech Republic and Yugoslavia, should sign a declaration to temporarily maintain their borders and oppose foreign interference in their internal affairs. One is the French-Italian agreement, which the countries that inherit Austrian territory can participate in, stipulating that the signatory countries should consult each other when Austria's independence is endangered. Echo and other newspapers believe that Hungary, Poland and Germany, even if they do not join the French-Italian agreement, must be able to participate in this memorandum. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome, Italian newspapers have published articles elaborating on the international significance of the French-Italian friendship. Among them, the semi-official "Italian Daily" said that the meeting between Laval and Mussolini was just after half a year of sudden tension in European life. Since half a year ago, the European situation has been tense, and there are many reasons for it, especially Germany's restoration of freedom of action regarding armaments. Germany's free action, rapid rearmament, and the revival of its national warlike spirit are all enough to threaten European peace. Therefore, at this time, the mutual cooperation of the major European countries is necessary, etc. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin, news of the conclusion of an agreement between France and Italy in Rome has spread here, and German newspapers have shown an extremely contemptuous attitude. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, recently, rumors have spread that Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Widger will visit London after visiting Paris. Today, Widger issued a declaration to the press, stating that Austrian cabinet members intend to meet with political leaders of Western European countries. Political figures here are very appreciative of this declaration. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, Foreign Minister Simon telegraphed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval today, sincerely wishing the success of the Rome talks, roughly saying that he and the British government hope that the French-Italian agreement will become a reality.

<p>MacDonald's Speech</p>
<h3 id="e44">Optimistic about the Future of Europe <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>

<p>Lochy Moss, British Prime Minister MacDonald, delivered a 20-minute national radio address starting at 9:30 tonight, saying that the birth of the League of Nations was like a hastily made altar of peace, on which a faint light was placed. Sometimes the light seemed to go out. We all know that after the light goes out, the future of human civilization will be unimaginable. But tonight, we see this light shining again. However, the wind has not stopped, so the light is swaying and there is still a risk of extinction. Regarding the meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval in Rome, MacDonald said that they have made us hope that this year's New Year's European peace situation can make great progress. Most of MacDonald's speech was about domestic issues, such as unemployment and housing issues. He is quite optimistic about the future of this year, saying that in all aspects, this year's commercial wages, and unemployment and other issues will be greatly improved. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>London, British Prime Minister MacDonald made a radio address on the occasion of the New Year, earnestly explaining the reasons for optimism this year to the British people. First, he stated that Britain's internal affairs are improving day by day, which is very satisfactory. Then, he assessed the international situation, roughly saying, "Our foreign work" has gradually brightened the future of peace. A peace treaty is to end the war. However, war cannot be ended only by a peace treaty, but must also rely on other means. After the peace treaty was concluded, the shrine of peace was deserted, and the only light in front of the hall was the League of Nations. However, this light also flickered, and there was a risk of extinction at any time. Now, we have finally seen the light in front of this peace hall shining again, and it is more radiant than before. Before the passing of 1934, Britain did its best for the League of Nations and peace. The Saar issue and the South Hungarian dispute were resolved with reliance on it. Now, France and Italy are conducting negotiations, and their purpose is to study how to eliminate obstacles to mutual trust. Mutual trust is the only guarantee of peace. From this point of view, will this new year open a new era for the tranquility of the European situation? MacDonald continued to mention Japan's abolition of the Washington Naval Treaty, still expressing optimism, saying that "Japan's abolition of the treaty is just issuing a notice, and it will actually take effect two years later. However, it cannot be said that it is not a serious change. But within two years, our country will never be negligent. We must find a new basis for agreement. With this new agreement, world peace can be maintained, and the arms race can also be prevented." In addition, in the history of the British Empire, 1935 will also be a memorable year. India will announce a new constitution and accept new responsibilities this year. We are willing to give it a sincere welcome. Not only that, at a time when storms are sweeping the world, Britain stands unshakable. This is what we should be glad about. Due to the differences in national conditions and the mistakes of party disputes, parliamentary politics and individual freedom are being destroyed everywhere. Only Britain's democratic politics stand alone, which is especially something we can be proud of. Three hundred years ago, the British poet Milton said, "Our English ancestors once knew how to teach their nation how to live, and future generations should not forget it." We are very fortunate to remember this golden saying today," etc. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e46">Open Door Policy <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>New York, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito said in a speech at the American Foreign Policy Association today that the United Kingdom and the United States should not limit Japan's navy at the same time when they have navies that can fight in Asia, making it impossible for them to fight with Europe and the United States. Because it is required that the navies of all countries should be reduced, and must be reduced to the point where they cannot attack others. Saito also carefully denied that the US government said that after Japan's naval equality, it could carry out aggression in the Far East and endanger the traditional open-door policy. He believes that Japan is not an imperialist country, just as the United States' permission for the Philippines to be independent is also abandoning its original position in the Far East. As for the oil problem in "Manchukuo", Saito believes that the protests of foreign oil companies are quite justified, saying that this matter "will be corrected". (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>New York, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito said in a speech at the Foreign Policy Association today that the accusation that Japan has often violated the principle of the open-door policy in China in the past has been denied by the reports of US consular officials stationed abroad. If the grievances of foreign merchants are true or justified, they will be remedied. The meaning of the open-door policy is the same as commercial fairness. Saito finally said that when any problem occurs, it should be dealt with through diplomatic channels and should not be solved by naval force. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Hiroshi Saito recently gave a speech at the Foreign Policy Association, in which he said, "The United States announced the principle of the open door in China in 1899, because at that time, the four countries of Britain, France, Russia, and Germany decided to divide spheres of influence in China and exclude Japan. At that time, the United States announced this principle in order to protect its trade with China. Since the abolition of the spheres of influence, in recent years, the so-called open-door policy has the same meaning as the equality and fairness of trade relations. Therefore, Japan's actions in China have not violated the open-door policy, and the reports of American consuls in China also deny that Japan has violated the principle of the open door. In short, various disputes regarding this issue should be resolved by diplomatic means, and should not rely on naval power as a backing," etc. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

Nagaoka is scheduled to go to Manchuria around the 10th to decide on changes in various organizations in Manchuria and the heads of Japanese officials in "Manchukuo". However, the change of the president of the South Manchurian Railway is due to the resignation of Director General Endo and Deputy Director Sakatani, the reappointment of President Hayashi, and General Minami Jiro hopes that Matsuoka Yosuke will serve as the president. Matsuoka is still negotiating whether to agree or not. In addition, the director general is also selected from local governors.</p>

<p>Senate to Discuss It as Soon as Possible. Washington - It is understood from the White House meeting that President Roosevelt advocates submitting the issue of the United States joining the World Court to the Senate for discussion as soon as possible. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington - The case of the United States joining the Hague International Court has been delayed for a long time and has not yet been approved. Recently, President Roosevelt has decided to listen to the leaders of the Democratic Party and request congressional approval this week. Tonight, the President held a meeting with Secretary of State Hull, Senate Democratic Leader Robinson, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Thurman, and Assistant Secretary of State Sweet. The aforementioned decision was made during the meeting. At one point, Roosevelt intended to submit a special message to Congress on this issue, but he has now given up because the issue of the United States joining the League of Nations will cause fierce debate in Congress, especially in the Senate. The Democratic leaders believe that the President should devote all his efforts to the new economic recovery plan and should not personally be involved in the congressional debate on joining the League of Nations. It is also heard that someone has proposed a plan for joining the Hague International Court, containing reservations stipulating that in the event of various disputes involving the United States, the United States may reject the jurisdiction of the Hague International Court. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will submit a report on this plan on Wednesday. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Special Message to Congress <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Public Works and Social Policies. Washington - President Roosevelt will submit a special message to Congress next week outlining plans for public works and social policies. The proposals will contain five very important points, which even those who have previously expressed dissatisfaction with the government will acknowledge that Congress will enact into law based on the President's recommendations. The five points are as follows: (1) Allocate US$1 billion to continue existing relief efforts until the public works plan proposed by the President in his message this Friday is implemented.</p>
<p>(2) Pass social security legislation, including plans for old-age pensions and unemployment insurance, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Uphold the government's financial plan to balance government revenue and expenditure.</p>
<p>(4) Stop waste and avoid tax increases.</p>
<p>(5) Design and promote a long-term public works plan to phase out direct relief expenditures as soon as possible.</p>
<p>According to observers familiar with the current situation, President Luo believes that the results of last year's election have sufficiently demonstrated national trust in the government's measures. Although the major industrial circles still unanimously oppose the President's relief plan but support the adoption of an unemployment subsidy system, the general electorate supports the President's plan to provide work for all people in the country. Economic, social, and other scholars also wholeheartedly support the government because unemployment subsidies have been implemented in other countries for a long time, and their negative effects are well known. Once people receive subsidies, they stop thinking about working, and thus become a permanent burden on society. According to those close to the White House, the President does not propose to implement all of his plans immediately but wants Congress to consider the matter during this session because the state legislatures of forty-one states are meeting at this time, and Congress can also take the opportunity to discuss it with them.

<p>The first Saarland vote will be held on Monday and Tuesday, something not widely known outside the area.

The voting locations for these advance votes are located in eight different places within the Saar region. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙ Saarbrücken</p>
<p>Prince Löwenstein, a famous exile in the Saar region, was recently stripped of his German nationality by the German government. Today, the Chairman of the Saar Governing Commission ordered him to leave the country within 48 hours. Löwenstein has been very active in recent days, supporting the aims of the secessionists in many ways. Although he has obtained Czech citizenship and could have remained uninvolved in the vote, he has still attended all secessionist gatherings, advocating secession with all his might and creating a newspaper devoted to secessionist propaganda, recently reprinting an extremely anti-German article. This may be the reason the Governing Commission felt compelled to suppress him.

<p>Today, the Saar Governing Commission suddenly issued an order to search the private residences of the leaders of the German Vanguard Corps. The reasons for this have not been announced. The recent actions and arrangements of the Governing Commission show a tendency to protect the parties opposed to Germany. This can be confirmed by the fact that the request of German nationals to hold a demonstration was only approved on the eve of yesterday's rally, even though the request was submitted to the Commission on December 22. In terms of transportation, there were also difficulties for the Germans. For example, the general manager of the railway company, who has always leaned towards the secessionists, used the excuse of a lack of vehicles to refuse to transport people from various places to the airfield here to participate in the rally. Currently, terrorist actions by Communists and secessionists continue to occur. Recently, two people in a car were attacked by thirty Communists, resulting in serious injuries and hospitalization.

<p>The Saar "German Front Group," previously approved by the Administrative Committee, held a demonstration today.

It was snowing heavily, and the cold was biting, but the demonstrators continued to march without discouragement. Some young people, wearing only a cotton woven shirt, sang loudly to keep warm as the snow and sleet fell, soaking their clothes. Many women were also in the procession, walking with them. Demonstrators were originally prohibited from wearing uniforms, so they all wore small hats and leather boots but did not wear badges. At times, Italian trucks drove through the crowd to clear the way. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to news from German political circles, if the result of the plebiscite in the Saar region is to merge with Germany, the German government will take important diplomatic decisions.

With the Saar issue resolved, the main obstacle to Franco-German understanding has been removed, so a concrete understanding will be proposed to France. (5th Havas Telegram)</p>

Recently, fascist terror has been rampant throughout Europe, so this move is particularly noteworthy. All countries seeking peace should launch a campaign to demand joint international action against provocative activities by terrorists.

A certain major power is truly responsible for it, while the consul of a certain small country is merely a blind tool of the true enemy of Soviet Russia. The government newspaper "Izvestia" took a more limited tone, while the Communist Party newspaper "Pravda" almost openly accused a certain major power in Central Europe of being the mastermind of the conspiracy, and said that anti-Soviet elements were very active in the capital of Yugoslavia and Berlin, ultimately leading to the assassination of Russian leader Kirov.

<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union's machine manufacturing industry will manufacture various machine tools worth 150 million rubles for automobile and tractor factories this year. This year, the automobile factories will have 69 new types of metal-cutting machines, 103 new types of iron-smelting furnaces, and flattening machines, all made by the Soviet Union itself. The heavy industry committee newspaper "Industrialization" stated that the speed of development of the machine tool industry in other countries in the world cannot compare with that of the Soviet Union. A few years ago, Soviet factories could only dream of using the achievements of modern machinery to manufacture automatic machine tools, flattening machines, and hammers, etc., but within two years, this technology will be completely mastered. "Today, we dare to undertake the task of supplying our own machine-made parts to new factories manufacturing automobiles and tractors. This is entirely dependent on the fact that in recent years, our country has established factories to manufacture machines and machine tools." (5th Tass Telegram)</p>

<p>Speech by the German Minister of Economy</p>
<h3 id="e54">Creditors and Raw Materials Issues <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(National News Agency Berlin Correspondent) The German Minister of Economy and President of the National Bank, Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, recently gave a speech at the opening of the Leipzig Fair, detailing the various difficulties currently facing the German economic system with a frank attitude. Dr. Schacht's speech not only provided guidance to German economists but also provided explanations and warnings to creditors of various countries. Dr. Schacht particularly addressed representatives of the news media from various countries, stating, "Only by reporting news and facts with a sincere attitude can the newspaper industry develop." Dr. Schacht also stated that Germany's economic difficulties under the Treaty of Versailles not only caused Germany to lose £125 million in gold but also lost colonies and other productive land. Furthermore, Germany was forced to pay trillions of pounds in compensation. The planning of this compensation could only seek foreign debt. The distant cause and near result of today's economic panic is based on this. Now the compensation has been cancelled, but Germany must still fulfill its obligation to pay interest on the debt contracts concluded due to the need to pay compensation. Maintaining foreign debt interest can only be compensated by exports. This is an indisputable economic truth. Dr. Schacht also stated that various countries are now increasing tariffs or devaluing currency to curb German imports when Germany is strengthening its economic power. This move is tantamount to driving Germany out of the world market and not allowing it to be a customer. Germany has always been the third largest customer in the world market. Suppressing its imports is tantamount to refusing to be a customer. Therefore, other countries that supply Germany with raw materials are restricting Germany's export trade. Germany has always been a reliable merchant in the world market. Today, it can only increase its imports within the scope of its economic capabilities. According to Dr. Schacht, under any circumstances, the country will do its best to assist in the establishment of domestically produced raw materials, even if the value of manufactured goods is more expensive than those purchased from foreign countries, because economically, it is better to hire the unemployed to manufacture raw materials than to have the public fund unemployment relief. The most obvious fact is the various inventions of Germany during the European War. No matter how much capital is invested in a certain invention, it will eventually be utilized. On the other hand, regarding the raw materials of necessities, attention must be paid to trade reciprocity. In short, the trade of goods with those who previously had no commercial relationship with Germany can now be initiated due to the Trade Reciprocity Act. The German government is determined to rescue Germany from the situation of oppression, but the destructive power of financial experiments or abandonment policies has already been seen by major industrial countries.</p>
<p>(Note: Dr. Hjalmar Schacht has the honor of being an authority on economics and finance and is an outstanding figure in European financial circles. Whether this warning should be verified, we can confirm it in fact in the near future.)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Observations on Japan's Trade in the Past Year (Japanese Correspondence) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>From January 1934 to mid-December of the same year, Japan's trade, the total value of exports, was 2,081,255,000 yuan, and the total value of imports was 2,176,705,000 yuan. In terms of exports, this was 291.45 million yuan more than the same period last year, and imports were 335.21 million yuan more than the same period last year. By the end of 1934, Japan's total trade volume would probably exceed 4.2 billion yuan, which is also possible. From an industrial and commercial perspective, this situation can truly be described as an unprecedented new record in the past five years. Therefore, most industrialists and businessmen are very optimistic, believing that Japan's economic future holds great promise for development.</p>
<p>However, amidst this thriving export situation, there is a shadow of pessimism, namely the total value of raw silk exports. From January to mid-December of last year, it was 391 million yuan, while in the same period this year, it was only 267 million yuan. In terms of the percentage of total exports, it has also fallen from 21.75% to 13.25%. This is not merely a matter of the rise and fall of commodities, but also has profound implications for Japan's industrial sector. It also has a significant impact on its entire national economy. In particular, the sustenance and prosperity of rural areas in various parts of Honshu are almost entirely dependent on silk. Furthermore, Japan's tax revenue, derived from rural areas and rural side businesses such as the silk industry, exceeds one-third of the total tax revenue. If sericulture declines chronically from now on, it is feared that more than just a portion of the rural areas will be affected. However, on the other hand, its light industry continues to develop upwards. Exports of cotton fabrics, including cotton cloth, wool crepe, and cotton yarn, totaled 526 million yuan, making them the largest export and its most effective weapon in capturing markets.</p>
<p>On the import side, cotton increased by 15 million yuan compared to last year, and wool increased by 9 million yuan. The increase in these two imports indicates a leap in the development of its cotton and wool textile industries, and also symbolizes that it will not only compete with Britain for the cotton textile market in the future, but also for the wool textile market. However, for the time being, it is gaining a slight advantage politically, namely that the large-scale import of Australian wool has eased Australia's antipathy towards Japan, thereby bringing Britain and Japan closer together.</p>
<p>In addition, what is more noteworthy is the increase in iron imports by 17 million yuan, the increase in machinery imports by 38 million yuan, and the increase in oil imports by 9 million yuan. The increase in these items is very different from the situation with cotton and wool. It is not related to industrial manufacturing, but rather a phenomenon of rapid progress in the military-industrial sector. From the prosperity of its military-industrial sector, we can infer the dangers it entails. We can also glean from this how much reality there is in the so-called maintenance of peace.</p>
<p>The total volume of export trade increased by 16% this year compared to last year. Except for the United States, it generally tended to increase. But what about the future? According to the observations of the Japanese economic community, it is believed that it has now reached a saturation point, and they dare not lightly be unconditionally optimistic. They are all paying considerable attention to vigilance.</p>
<p>Since Japan's foreign trade has developed in this way, and the world market has certain limitations, other countries, especially Britain and the United States, will naturally be hit. Therefore, they are building political barriers to engage in confrontation. For example, in 1933, Britain abolished the trade treaty with Japan in West Africa, and India also imposed special restrictions on the import of Japanese cotton textiles. A quota system for the import of foreign-made textiles was also implemented in other British colonies. Needless to say, the goal of this matter is to deal with Japan. In August of this year, the United States concluded a new trade treaty with Cuba, stipulating that American light bulbs have priority over those made by other countries, which is also a boycott of Japan.</p>
<p>Since Japan implemented currency devaluation, it has an advantage in the international exchange market. It is difficult for Britain and the United States to stand by and watch any longer. In the future, they may either conclude a monetary agreement to seek temporary relief, or re-establish political barriers to confront Japanese goods. Also, the "Manchurian" stone monopoly law implicitly contains military implications, and at the same time restricts the import of British and American oil. Britain has protested against this, but Japan has only evaded it. This is bound to develop into a major problem in the near future. Even if it is temporarily silenced by some means, it will eventually cause trouble, because this is not only about oil, but also hides an arms race. (December 29th)</p>
<p>Instructions of Chairman Chiang in Hangzhou</p>
<h3 id="e71">Thoroughly Implement the New Life <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Aspire to Exert and Strive to Strengthen</p>
<p>Revive the Nation and Build the Country</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Chairman Chiang attended the swearing-in ceremony of the members of the Zhejiang Provincial Government on New Year's Day of the 24th year and delivered instructions. The original text is recorded as follows: "Chairman Huang, members of the Provincial Government, heads of departments, today our Zhejiang Provincial Government members hold a swearing-in ceremony, which coincides with the New Year's Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China, which is also the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and the President's assumption of office in Nanjing. Our Zhejiang Provincial Government, from Chairman Huang and the members below, take office on such an important anniversary worthy of rejoicing. Of course, it has a very important significance, whether for the country, for our party, or for Zhejiang Province. Today's ceremony will leave a very important commemoration. I would like to take this rare opportunity to contribute a few words to the chairman of the provincial government and the members of the provincial government, as well as to all comrades and compatriots in Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Now it is the 24th year of the Republic of China, which means that our country has grown to 24 years old. Generally speaking, for an ordinary person, at the age of 24, they have completed their studies and must be able to stand on their own feet. It is truly the time when they are in their prime. Our country is also like this. At the age of 24, it should have grown into a new country in its prime, capable of self-reliance, striving, and being promising. Therefore, on this New Year's Day of the 24th year, everyone should take advantage of this good opportunity to renew their aspirations and strive for self-improvement. Not only should the chairman of the provincial government and the members of the provincial government have a new spirit, but also all comrades and compatriots should also seize the time to develop a new spirit. The New Life Movement initiated by Brother Bei last year was to enable the people of the whole country to cleanse away old dirt and refresh their spirits, in order to revive our nation and build a modern country. Since its initiation, all comrades in Zhejiang have been very enthusiastic in promoting it. This time, when Brother Bei arrived in Hangzhou, he also accepted the invitation of the promotion association</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>for guidance. Now, taking advantage of today's opportunity, I would like to tell all comrades that last year was the period of advocating and piloting the New Life Movement. Calculating, it has been almost a year. This year, the 24th year of the Republic of China, we want everyone to agree to be a year of thoroughly implementing the New Life. Starting from today, New Year's Day, everyone should aspire to reform the old and establish the new, and thoroughly eliminate all the shortcomings in the past in life, society, politics, and all aspects. All our thoughts, words, and actions must be renewed according to the principles of the New Life Movement. Not only should we be able to refresh ourselves in form, but we must also achieve consistency in spirit, so that everything can truly conform to "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame." Only in this way can our politics, society, and the entire country have a new atmosphere and generate a new spirit. Only in this way can we complete our revolutionary cause. I have made such an agreement with everyone on New Year's Day today. Please Chairman Huang lead the comrades and compatriots of our entire province to work hard according to this idea, and be sure to build</p>
<p>a new Zhejiang that thoroughly implements the New Life, and extend it to build a truly new Republic of China. Secondly, as the central supervisor has just said, Zhejiang Province has many things that should be done and malpractices that should be eliminated. In particular, Zhejiang suffered a severe drought last year, and most of the people suffered hardships, and the rural economy was impoverished and exhausted. It is urgent for all members of the provincial government and general comrades to work together with kindness and compassion to find ways to relieve them. There are many things we need to do at present, and we cannot do everything all at once. However, the Premier said that those who have aspirations will succeed. As long as we are willing to study and work hard, no one cannot be taught well, no one thing cannot be used for the country and the people, and no one thing cannot be successful. And the most important condition is that we have spirit and can practice the spirit of "doing it practically, doing it quickly, and doing it hard" that I often talk about. We must be able to truly follow the ancient saying "be selfless in public affairs and forget your family in national affairs" to work hard. Therefore, the general malpractices are either respecting and stealing security, muddling through, or dealing with things superficially, not valuing practicality, valuing private over public, only knowing oneself, not knowing others, and not even knowing the country and the nation. Therefore, there is never any progress in politics, society, and all aspects, and a truly new country has not yet been built. The people of Zhejiang, in terms of natural ability, are not behind others, but complacency, selfishness, procrastination, and laxity are also undeniable. From now on, all comrades responsible for party affairs, politics, education, and society, especially the leaders present today, must work with a spirit of impartiality and truth-seeking, and practice what I have just said, advocate for the people, and thoroughly reform the past atmosphere of perfunctoriness, complacency, valuing private over public. From the provincial government to the local counties, no matter what happens, we must do one point and have one point of practical effect, so that the people's strength will not be wasted and time will not be wasted. Only in this way can we build a new politics, establish the foundation of the revolution, and complete the mission of the revolution.</p>
<p>However, if we want to be sure to achieve this goal and truly establish a new Zhejiang that can serve as a model for the whole country, there is also a basic political principle that cannot be forgotten, that is, all powers must be unified and concentrated. Avoid scattering and division, and avoid being complicated and lacking essentials. All the malpractices of disunity and lack of concentration in the past must be thoroughly corrected. From now on, all comrades and compatriots in the province must work together with one heart and one mind to support the government and support the chairman in all the things that the central government and the people of the province expect the provincial government to do, in order to complete the construction of a new Zhejiang, that is, to fulfill the responsibilities that all comrades and local people should fulfill.</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Day of the 24th year of the Republic of China. Starting from today, we must all make twenty-four points of effort in order to achieve twenty-four points of success, and satisfy the country and the people's twenty-four points of expectations. Now our work is very important, and the opportunity has already arrived. As long as everyone works together, we will surely have great success and can satisfy everyone's hopes. These are the few words that I want to contribute today. I wish you all health and success."</p>

<h3 id="e77">The Course of the Disaster <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>When Zhang Weicun was assassinated in the Jinde Association, his follower, Yang Jinjian, was also shot twice, one in the back of the left arm, which entered and exited from the front well, and one grazed his shoulder. He was sent to Jinan Hospital for treatment that night. After being given a heart stimulant, he was out of danger. All the circumstances of Zhang Weicun's assassination at that time have been roughly described by Yang Jinjian, but the details are not clear. In order to understand the detailed circumstances at that time, the reporter visited Yang at Jinan Hospital at 2:00 p.m. today (4th) and learned that Yang was living in Room 14 of the First Ward in the hospital, lying on a copper bed under the west wall, with his head south and feet north, covered with a blue woolen blanket, his face pale, and his spirit not yet recovered. His left arm was wrapped in white cloth and could not be moved, making it difficult to turn over. When the reporter entered, Yang slightly nodded his head on the bed. When Yang spoke, his voice was extremely low and he closed his eyes from time to time, thinking about what happened at that time. According to Yang, "The night of the 2nd was the second day of the New Life Movement Lantern Parade. Zhang Weiyuan was responsible for guiding it. After eating at the mansion at 5:00 p.m., Zhang Weiyuan went to the Party Headquarters, and Zhang Weiyuan urged the people at the Party Headquarters to quickly go to the Huangting Gymnasium to gather. At 5:45, Zhang Weiyuan and I went to Huangting again. At this time, the lights of various agencies had been prepared and gathered. After Zhang Weiyuan gave a speech, Zhang Weiyuan and I started to arrange things at the Jinde Association. The original plan was to go to Ximen Street, but because there were so many people with lanterns, we changed to Nannen and went straight to the Jinde Association on Qima Road. When we arrived at the entrance of the Jinde Association, Zhang Weiyuan walked into the gate and followed the gravel path to the south, passing the billiard room and going south until before the Peking Opera stage. Zhang Weiyuan stood on the slope where the memorial week was held every Monday and looked around. About five minutes, Zhang Weiyuan's location of the assassination at the Jinde Association, near the Kongsheng Pavilion, then walked from the billiard room to the northeast path. At that time, Zhang Weiyuan was in front and I was behind, only two or three steps apart. After passing the children's playground, we followed the path to the north. When we arrived at the side of the Kongsheng Pavilion, the people playing with lanterns and the people walking on stilts were all on the west side. The lights were bright and the noise was loud, but the area around the Kongsheng Pavilion was extremely quiet. There were no tourists and there were small pine trees on both sides. The shadows of the lights were dim, making it feel even more quiet. At this time, Zhang Weiyuan planned to pass through the golf course and go to the committee room, because Zhang Weiyuan's route was always like this every time he went to the Jinde Association, which had become a habit. Unexpectedly, at this moment, the murderer opened fire from behind. Three shots were fired in a row. The first shot hit me in the shoulder, and I fell down. Although I felt a pain in my shoulder that went straight to my heart, I knew it was not good in my heart. I got up from the ground and took two or three steps to the east, planning to pull out my gun. At this time, the murderer had fired four or five shots. When I was shot for the first time, Zhang Weiyuan looked back, and the second shot hit Zhang Weiyuan in the head. At that time, Zhang Weiyuan fell to the ground. At this time, my pistol had already been pulled out, but I could not pull the bolt because my body was paralyzed. When I turned my head, the assassin had run west into the pine forest. I shouted that there was an assassin, but because the noise was loud, no one responded. I ran to the gate. When I ran to the gate, I saw the Public Security Bureau law enforcement team. I said that Zhang Weiyuan had been assassinated and that the door should be guarded. At this time, it was only five or six minutes. Because I had been shot in the shoulder and ran for a long time, I could not walk at that time. The Public Security Bureau sent me to Jinan Hospital. Recalling that there were three murderers at the time, the one who assassinated me was a tall man in an ash-gray gown and a felt hat. The other two were short. At that time, the tall one was in front and the short ones were behind. The tall man was very quick. He shot me first, a total of three shots. I was shot twice, and the missing shot hit Zhang Weiyuan in the head. Usually, I don't pay attention to whether anyone is following me. There were too many people that night, so it was even more impossible to keep track of them. Zhang Weiyuan usually carried a gun, and he was carrying a gun that night, but because the incident happened suddenly, the first shot hit the vital point, so there was no time to pull out the gun. Moreover, the murderer came from behind. After shooting, he ran west. Because the left side of the Peacock Pavilion is full of pine trees that are as tall as a person, the murderer ran into the pine forest and could not be seen. At that time, the people playing with lanterns in the west were drumming and the tourists were like ants. I think the murderer must have mixed into the crowd and took the opportunity to escape," he said.</p>
<p>Yang Jinjian is 26 years old, from Zaoqiang County, Hebei Province. He has been following Zhang Weicun for more than a year. His mother is old, his father is dead, and he has two brothers. The eldest brother, Yang Jinting, is a farmer in his hometown of Zaoqiang, and the second brother, Yang Jinshan, is working in the Jiangyin County Government in Jiangsu Province. (4th)</p>

<p>After the Severe Disaster in Northern Jiangxi</p>
<h3 id="e79">Agricultural Product Prices Plummet <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Farmers Endure Pain and Sell at Reduced Prices</p>
<p>Refugees Gather in Xun City Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: The half of northern Jiangxi centered on Jiujiang has suffered severe drought and floods in the past, resulting in this tragic desolation. Now the famine has not abated slightly, the production of various items has decreased, and agricultural products and their by-products have increased in price due to insufficient supply. This is a natural principle, but it is now completely wrong. Except for the price of rice in Jiujiang City, which is 12.23 yuan per load, the items that come to the market from the countryside for sale are cheaper than expected. For example, chickens are ten catties per yuan, cabbage is ten texts per catty, and eggs, which were previously hindered by foreign-made products, were as low as 20 or 25 texts each. Pork is more than six catties per yuan, and retail is only 640 texts per catty. Ducks are also only one dime per catty. Prices are so cheap that it is almost suspected that there is overproduction, peace of mind for the people, and abundance of goods. In fact, it is because the rural areas have gone bankrupt. They only have to sell everything in their homes at a reduced price to make up for the loss. For example, piglets that are not full of dozens of catties and chicks that are not more than half a catty are also brought to be sold in order to exchange for a small amount of rice, or to pay rent or pay off debts. After selling everything, they often abandon their homes and flee the famine, wandering in foreign lands, only to fill the ditches. When the reporter took the China Merchants Jianghua ship from Nanjing to Xun the other day, many of the refugees who squeezed onto the ship along the way were haggard-looking. The refugees from the four villages of Jiujiang City who came to Xun Wharf to beg for food also gathered in Xun Wharf. Although the authorities sent people to block them from entering at the important intersections on the one hand, and set up shelters to accommodate them as much as possible on the other hand, the refugees begging for food on the streets are still rampant, carrying men and holding women, hungry and cold. The situation is very tragic. According to locals, along the Jiang River near the China Merchants Wharf in Xun Wharf, refugees, beggars, and vagrants who sleep in the open air must freeze to death three or four people every night. The authorities and local charities are now working hard to provide relief to this item, but I am afraid that a drop in the bucket will still not help. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Jiangsu Province Rectifies Lake Fields <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The First Phase of the Clearing Plan is Approved</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: In order to continue to thoroughly clear the mature lake fields reclaimed by the people in the counties along Taihu Lake in this province, the Jiangsu Provincial Government abolished the Taihu Lake Field Bureau and established the Taihu Lake Field Clearing Office, and approved the first phase of the clearing method, which is divided into four items: registration, surveying, payment, and issuance of licenses. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e81">Registration <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>1. All reclamation households and grain households who have reclaimed mature lake fields must apply to the Clearing Office for registration within one month from the date of announcement, and they are allowed to report and receive them with priority. 2. Lake fields without grain should first be given to the original reclamation households to receive them. If there are lake fields with grain that are measured and found to have exceeded the amount of grain-free lake fields, the excess acres should first be given to the grain owners to pay the price and receive them. However, if the grain owners have not paid the embankment labor fees, they should compensate the reclamation households for the embankment labor fees of five yuan per acre. 3. If the reclamation households and grain owners do not comply with the order to register within the stipulated time limit, they should first be given to the current tenant farmers to receive them. 4. If the reclamation households, grain owners, and tenant farmers do not comply with the order to register and pay within the stipulated time limit, the Clearing Office may issue a notice for auction. 5. The reclamation households, grain owners, or tenant farmers should submit the location, acres, and boundaries of the reclaimed lake fields to the Clearing Office for registration. Each household that reports for receipt should pay a deposit of one yuan per acre, and the Clearing Office will issue a receipt. When the case is decided and the license is issued, it can be used as a抵 within the正价 that should be paid, and the receipt will be cancelled.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Surveying <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>1. After the Clearing Office receives the registration application from the lake people, it should immediately assign a surveying team to survey each location one by one. 2. The surveying team should draw a detailed map based on the surveying results. 3. Three copies of the map should be drawn for each case, one copy attached to the license, one copy kept at the office, and one copy submitted to the office for future reference. 4. The location, boundaries, acres, name of the boundary marker, date of measurement, and name of the surveyor should be indicated on the map. 5. The calculation of length and area should be in accordance with the regulations of the measurement and law promulgated by the National Government. All lake fields that are mixed with grain should be presented with the grain string for the last five years and other documents at the time of reporting, so that they can be verified and划除. If there is no grain string document to be presented, it should be regarded as grain-free and pay the price for放领. After the lake fields with grain are registered and surveyed, the Clearing Office will issue a升科知照单 and advise the county to升科, so as to重赋政.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Payment of Price <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>1.  The price shall be paid according to the classification of lake fields and grades: Grade A, fish ponds, mulberry gardens, fruit gardens, and high-lying areas: eight yuan per mu; low-lying areas: six yuan per mu. Grade B, rice paddies and water fields: four yuan per mu. However, when reclamation households or tenant farmers undertake the lease, an additional 20% shall be charged based on the above prices.</p>
<p>2.  When undertaking the lease of lake fields, in addition to paying the regular price as stipulated, a handling fee of 5% of the regular price according to the regulations of the register, a surveying fee of 5% (to be equally disbursed by the Office and the Department), and one jiao per mu shall be paid.</p>
<p>3.  Households that report for the lease of lake fields shall pay the regular and additional prices and fees in full within one month after receiving the surveying notice.</p>
<p>4.  If a lessee who reports for the lease of lake fields is financially constrained, they shall be allowed to pay the price in three equal installments, with each installment lasting two months. However, an additional 5% shall be charged on each installment paid.</p>
<p>5.  If a lessee fails to pay the regular and additional prices and fees in full after six months, the bureau shall issue a certificate based on the amount of money already paid and the corresponding area of land. The remaining land shall be re-advertised for sale. If the price is not paid at all, all of the land shall be auctioned off separately.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Issuance of Certificates <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>1.  If a lessee pays all the prices and fees payable in one lump sum, the clearing office shall issue a printed receipt, fill out a payment certificate, and submit it to the Finance Department for the issuance of a license.</p>
<p>2.  If a lessee pays the prices and fees payable in installments, the clearing office shall issue a printed receipt for each installment. The payment certificate shall be filled out again on the date of full payment and submitted to the Department for the issuance of a license.</p>
<p>3.  The clearing office shall remit all the collected prices and fees to the treasury on a daily basis and report them to the Department. The Finance Department shall allocate half of the regular price payable to the Taihu Water Conservancy Commission.</p>
<p>4.  The Finance Department shall verify and fill out the provincial certificate, which shall be transferred by the office to the practitioner, and shall promptly notify the county government to increase the grain tax. (6th)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Collection of Relief Grain Types <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Limited to Daily Food</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: In the past, due to the severe drought in various counties of Anhui Province this year, the Anhui Provincial Government specially set up offices for collecting relief grain in Dashengguan, Wuhu, Bengbu, Guxian, Chenjiaqian, Dingbu and other places, and established branches in Anqing, Huayang, Tianchang, Jiangba and other places. Recently, the Executive Yuan ordered the Anhui Provincial Government to close all of them by the end of the 23rd year. The Anhui Provincial Government still considered that the disaster situation in various counties was too serious and the amount of relief grain collected was insufficient, and requested a postponement of the cancellation. However, the Dashengguan branch was strongly opposed by the Beijing Municipal Government and has now been moved to Xiliang Mountain in Anhui Province to continue the collection. At the moment, the provincial government is considering the types of relief grain to be collected in various places, which originally included black and white sesame seeds, peanuts, sunflower seeds, melon seeds, and ten kinds of beans such as green, black, tea, mud, dried, yuan, silkworm, red, flat, and rice beans. It has repeatedly requested exemption from collection, and the Nanchang Provisional Headquarters has instructed that the collection of relief grain should be limited to food that can be directly used as daily meals for the people, and shall not be collected at a discounted price or distributed after price changes. Other miscellaneous grains that cannot be used as daily food and have very low yields shall also be removed and exempted from collection. A separate list of relief grain types to be collected shall be prepared and submitted for approval, etc. The matter has been raised at the 258th talk meeting of the provincial government, and it was resolved that peanuts and other categories should be exempted from the collection of relief grain. The types of grain that will continue to be collected as before and those that will be exempted are listed below. (1) To continue to collect: rice, glutinous rice, broken rice, paddy rice, glutinous paddy rice, wheat, barley, buckwheat, millet, sorghum, six-grain rice, six-grain millet, soybeans, mung beans. (2) Exempted from collection: green beans, black beans, tea beans, yuan beans, dried beans, mud beans, silkworm beans, red beans, flat beans, black and white sesame seeds, rapeseed, peanuts, peanut kernels, rice beans, sunflower seeds, melon seeds.

<p>Hubei Province This Year</p>
<h3 id="e86">Production and Construction Plan <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Coal, Cotton, Tung Oil, and Yarn are Listed as the Four Major Policies</p>
<p>The Construction Department Decides to Raise One Million Yuan to Handle</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In the past two years, all construction in Hubei Province has focused on transportation, and highways and telephones have been largely completed. Starting this year, further efforts will be made in production and construction. The authorities of the Construction Department are currently formulating a plan to improve coal, cotton, tung oil, and yarn as the four major policies, and have decided to raise one million yuan to handle them. A brief account is given below:</p>
<h3 id="e87">Coal <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The coal-producing areas of this province include Wuchang, Puchi, Daye, Yangxin, Nanzhang, Yuan'an, Changyang, Zigui, Xingshan, Badong, and other counties. The coal in Dexi at the border between Zigui and Xingshan is of superior quality and abundant quantity, and is known as the Xiangxi Coal System in the domestic mining industry. The recoverable output has as many as eight layers, with a total thickness of eight meters and a length of 50 kilometers. Its quality is very strong in cohesiveness after burning and is rich in coking properties. The usual method of coking can be divided into two types: non-by-product coking and by-product coking. The non-by-product coking method cannot obtain other by-products besides coke, such as in Liuhegou, Pingxiang, Zhongxing, and Kaiyuan, etc. The by-product coking method can obtain coal gas, gasoline, sulfuric acid, and nickel, etc. in addition to coke. The by-product coking method is further divided into high-temperature distillation and low-temperature distillation. The coking in Jingxing is based on the high-temperature distillation method, mainly for producing iron and steel, and gasoline is a by-product. This province is rich in iron sand in Xiangbishan, which can be used to coke with Xiangxi coal using the high-temperature distillation method, and engage in the steel industry. However, there are many places in the country where coke is produced, and the steel industry cannot be established with a small amount of capital. Moreover, several layers of Xiangxi coal have a high content of volatile matter. It has now been decided to adopt the low-temperature coal coking method, with the extraction of by-products such as gasoline as the main purpose. The semi-coke produced can be used as household fuel, which is more suitable and economical than the briquettes sold in Wuhan. In addition to gasoline, machine oil, fertilizer powder, and asphalt can also be extracted, which is very beneficial.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Cotton <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>This province's cotton production ranks second in the country. However, ignorant merchants tend to mix water and adulterate it, resulting in a loss of credibility and farmers and merchants are in distress. It is now planned to set up 20 to 50 ginning and baling factories in the cotton-producing areas of Xianghua and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to centrally control ginning and baling. The ginning machine will be a saw-tooth ginning machine, and the baling machine will be a new-style Shanghai double-box wooden machine, which can bale four bales weighing 250 catties per hour. The baled bales must be small in volume to prevent moisture and adulteration. The fiber grades will be further distinguished to facilitate the purchase of yarn mills. It will also cooperate with the Commodity Inspection Bureau to jointly handle origin inspection and be responsible for transportation. It can be directly transported to Jiujiang, Wuhu, Shanghai, and other places, eliminating the trouble of temporary delays and re-packaging in Hankou, so that the cotton industry can be developed to seek rural revitalization.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Tung <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Tung oil is one of China's special products. In the past, the value of exports was quite large. However, in recent years, the United States has imitated the manufacture of tung oil with considerable success, causing China's tung oil to be severely hit in the international market. Recently, Japan has also been encouraging cultivation in Korea, and the export of tung oil will inevitably be more affected in the future. As for the national tung oil production, 80 to 90 percent are exported from Hankou to foreign countries. According to the commodity inspection bureau's investigation of tung oil exports in the past three years, it was 937,707 dan in the 19th year, 606,712 dan in the 20th year, and 476,3663 dan in the 21st year, showing a decreasing trend year by year. There are about 20 counties in the Jiangxiang basins and southern Hubei Province that are suitable for planting tung trees. In March and April last year, the Construction Department planted 7 dan of tung oil seeds in Jun County, Caodian, and Shihua Street, obtaining 800 to 900 tung trees, with a survival rate of 90 percent. In order to increase production and save foreign trade, it has been decided to concentrate on afforestation in Jingshan or Jingmen on a large scale this spring. While using tractors to reclaim wasteland, animal husbandry will also be carried out to make it a group farm.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Yarn <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>This province's cotton production also ranks second in the whole country, so it is suitable for operating yarn mills. Wuhan currently has five mills: Shenxin, Taian, First, Yuhua, and Minsheng. However, the official yarn bureau run by the province has long been discontinued. It has now been decided to move the machinery of the yarn bureau to the Fancheng area for operation. First, it is close to the cotton-producing area, and the raw materials can be transported without trouble. Second, the products can be sold nearby in Henan and Shaanxi, which is more convenient than concentrating in Wuhan. (4th)</p>

<p>A Male Corpse Found Dead on the Road in Xiang Santu</p>
<p>Yesterday, a male corpse was suddenly found dead on the road in Zhou Agen's shed in Xiang Santu, east of Huayang Bridge in this city. He was wearing a peaked cap, worn-out military uniform, and was barefoot. He was about 30 years old. It is not known why he died. The Xiang police of the district reported to Xu Zhen's chief Chunpu, who in turn reported to the county court. This morning, Prosecutor Du was commissioned to go to the countryside for an examination. It was found that there were no injuries. The Xiang police were ordered to collect a coffin and place the body in it, and a notice was posted to solicit the relatives of the deceased to claim the coffin for verification.</p>

<p>Wang Sixian, the President of the County Court of this county, has been ordered to be promoted to the President of the Nantong County Court. Yang Litang has been appointed to succeed him. According to reports, Mr. Yang has served as a prosecutor of the Supreme Court and a president of the County Court. It is said that he will come to Songjiang to take office around the 15th. President Wang has sent a clerk of the court to Tong County a few days ago to negotiate the handover date, and has ordered his staff to handle the handover.</p>

<p>The Head of the Autonomous Experimental District Resigns</p>
<p>Townspeople Jointly Telegraph to Retain Him</p>
<p>Zhu Wenyuan, the head of the autonomous experimental district, has been handling local autonomy with outstanding achievements. Especially during the January 28th Incident, he never left his post, and the local area benefited a lot. Afterwards, the people were grateful for his righteousness and bravery, and specially built a pavilion and erected a monument in front of the district office (Lu Jia Bang Town) to commemorate him.

Each branch bureau and station should adopt a patrol system to maintain the business flag. (3) During the New Year, the old customs of worshipping gods and ancestors and setting off firecrackers are often still used, which is not only easy to cause misunderstandings, but also easy to catch fire, and should be banned.

<p>Appealing for Relief for Primary School Expenses The tuition fees for each primary school in this county are stipulated by the bureau to be 80 yuan per semester for each grade. If the amount collected is insufficient, the principal must make up for it. Recently, the principals of various primary schools have stated that at this time of rural economic bankruptcy, coupled with the drought, the harvest is hopeless, and it is extremely difficult to collect tuition fees.

If all the principals make up for it, it will inevitably be impossible to maintain. Therefore, the County Education Association convened a temporary executive committee meeting yesterday and resolved to submit a request to the County Education Bureau for prompt relief.</p>

<p>San Bei Company Announces: To Whom It May Concern: Our company's Ningxing steamship has been operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route for many years, with the sole purpose of facilitating the travel of passengers and the transportation of goods in the Ningbo area. Recently, the rural economy has been declining, and Ningbo's taxation on agricultural exports as a commercial port has been greatly affected. In addition, highways in various counties of Ningbo are gradually opening to traffic. In order to assist the rural areas of Ningbo and in line with the principle of facilitating transportation, our company has invested heavily in building wharves and warehouses in Zhenhai, connecting them to the county and provincial roads. We have added the Mingxing steamship to open the Shanghai-Zhenhai route, also covering Wan and Ningbo. All local products imported and exported on the Shanghai-Zhenhai route will be exempt from taxes, with the approval of the Inspectorate General of Customs, in order to provide a lifeline for the farmers of Ningbo. Passengers from Ningbo will save time and money. We hope that people from all walks of life in Ningbo will pay attention. Furthermore, the Mingxing steamship employs attendants and has fixed service fees included in the ticket price, which will be strictly enforced. The launch is imminent. We hereby announce.</p>

<p>Post Office Suddenly Orders Detention of Private Mails</p>
<p>The Weighing Regulation Abolished</p>
<p>Private Mail Businesses Still Make a Final Stand</p>
<h3 id="e126">Weighing Regulation Abolished <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reports that the National Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications, due to the failure of private postal agencies to comply with the order to close down, has abolished the weighing regulation and has ordered the detention of all private mails to and from South China, North China, the Yangtze River area, and inland ports. The National Private Postal Agencies Association is awaiting instructions from the central government before making a final stand. Details are as follows: In order to preliminarily restrict the private postal agencies, the Ministry of Communications, considering that their operations disrupt the postal system, promulgated the Provisional Weighing Regulation for Private Mail in 1929. Initially, a weighing fee of 20 cents was charged per pound, which was gradually increased to 75 cents and 95 cents. In 1933, it was increased to $1.25 per pound. In April of last year, it was changed to a fee of 10 cents for every two ounces of mail, totaling $1.65 per pound. After the Ministry of Communications increased the weighing fee every year, the private postal agencies could not bear the burden, and private postal agencies across the country could not maintain their operations, and 15 percent closed down. This regulation was originally a temporary measure to restrict private postal agencies. Now that private postal agencies have been restricted to close down by the end of last year, this regulation is no longer necessary. Therefore, the National Postal Administration has issued a notice to all post offices to abolish it. If private mail is found again, it will be detained and punished as private delivery of letters.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Private Mails Detained in Various Places <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of their own survival and the livelihood of tens of thousands of employees, the National Private Postal Agencies Association is still making a final appeal to the Ministry of Communications regarding the deadline order. The central authorities have not yet issued a formal order on whether to ban or allow them to exist. Therefore, private postal businesses are still operating as usual. However, in order to implement the ban, the post office has detained all private mails to and from various places since December 30th of last year. A reporter from Da Gong News Agency inquired at the Shanghai Private Mail Association about the detained letters yesterday. In South China, this includes Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, You Tou, Guangzhou. In the Yangtze River area, this includes Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Anqing, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Shanghai. In North China, this includes Tianjin, Beiping, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Jinan. In the inland, such as Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other major ports, all incoming and outgoing private mails have now been detained.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Private Postal Businesses Make a Final Stand <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Da Gong News Agency went to the north and south districts of the city and the concession yesterday to investigate the situation of the private postal agencies. The entrances were deserted, and the contrast with the past was overwhelming. When asked, the person in charge of the Private Mail Association replied that private postal businesses across the country still hope that the government will understand the difficulties of the people and withdraw the order to ban them. However, the central government has not yet issued any instructions. Therefore, they are still operating as usual. If the government does not give a satisfactory reply in the future, they will convene a general meeting to make a final stand.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Anxiety of Senders <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to general opinion, the post office should first take fundamental measures to ban private postal agencies before stopping them from accepting and sending private mails. It should not detain the letters that have already been sent halfway. Generally, merchants and civilians send letters for convenience. Some believe that private postal agencies are more convenient and therefore abandon the post office and go to private postal agencies. Before the private postal agencies petition the government and before the government has issued instructions, they still send mails as usual. The post office should not detain the letters, as it is making things difficult for the senders. It is like the saying "eating at the neighbor's door and thanking the neighbor across the street," which is not a good way to do things.</p>
<p>And Accountant Wang Sifang Is Appointed Liquidator to Handle All Aftermath. Details Are as Follows:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Notice of Suspension <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The branch announces the suspension of business: To Whom It May Concern: Since the establishment of this branch by the Hong Kong Savings Bank, we have received support from all walks of life, and our business has been doing well. However, due to temporary financial difficulties, the Hong Kong head office has suspended operations.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>As a branch, we have also been ordered to comply. In addition to liquidating according to law, we hereby announce this.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Announcement of Liquidation <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Song Yunhui and Accountant Wang Sifang, appointed as liquidators of the Kwang Hua Savings Bank Shanghai Branch Co., Ltd., announce: The lawyer and accountant have been appointed as liquidators of the Kwang Hua Bank Shanghai Branch Co., Ltd. In addition to reporting to the competent authorities for record, we hereby notify all creditors to bring their credentials to our office within two weeks to report their claims for repayment. All debtors are also requested to come to the office to pay off their debts within the above period. Please do not delay. This is hereby announced. January 6, 1935. Lawyer Song Yunhui, Accountant Wang Sifang. Office: 280 Beijing Road. Telephone: 14133.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Liquidator Speaks <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to liquidator Wang Sifang, the bank has officially closed down, and all books and records were taken over in their entirety late the day before yesterday, around midnight. Regarding profit and loss, because the contents have not yet been clarified, it is not yet possible to make a definitive conclusion about the debtor and creditor situation. However, after offsetting deposits and loans, depositors may not suffer losses. The results of the audit will definitely be announced in the next few days, and then liquidation will be carried out according to law. At the same time, reports will be submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, as well as the Ministry of Industry and Finance, for record. According to a person in charge of Lawyer Song Yunhui's office, another liquidator, yesterday's report in a certain newspaper that the Kwang Hua Bank had offsetting deposits and loans and that creditors would be able to recover half of their claims, and the remarks made by a staff member of the bank, Mr. Wei, that the total savings deposits were $175,000, the loans made were $130,000, and $230,000 had been transferred to the head office, are all inaccurate. This Mr. Wei is only a junior employee with a monthly salary of $15 who has not been working for long and does not know the details. Moreover, at the end of last year, the Hong Kong head office telegraphed requesting a remittance of a certain amount, but the manager of the Shanghai branch, in order to protect the depositors here, did not grant the request. As for the accounts, because the closure occurred on the day after the New Year's holiday, the accounts for last year had already been settled, and the accounts for this year only covered one day, January 4, so the inspection is very convenient. It should be possible to announce the balance sheet of the branch in about three or four days.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Creditor Aspect <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to the person in charge, yesterday morning, some creditors with larger deposits came to the office, intending to organize a creditors' association in the office, but this was not permitted. These depositors, totaling about $120,000 to $130,000, were relatively calm, only saying that they hoped to reach a conclusion before the end of the lunar year so that they could get funds. There are very few depositors with several thousand or several hundred dollars, and they have not yet taken any action. If there are losses as a result of the liquidation, priority will be given to repaying the savings deposits of depositors.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Huang Zigang Petitioned <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>To Undertake the Transfer and Delivery Bureau, Original Transfer of Mail in the Four Northeastern Provinces is Purely a Private Business, Says Central News Agency. The three businesses of various mails and packages, remittances, etc., to and from the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, will be transferred by the Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou Transfer and Delivery Bureau from January 10th and February 1st respectively. The previous report details the situation, but what is the internal organization of the so-called Transfer and Delivery Bureau? This is what the people of the country want to know. A reporter learned from reliable sources that the so-called Transfer and Delivery Bureau is purely a private business undertaken by retired postal worker Huang Zigang. We have found Huang Zigang's petition to undertake the business as follows: To Petition: The northeastern four provinces are rich in land, and hundreds of thousands of compatriots from within the pass go to the northeast to reclaim land and do business every year. The funds remitted back to the pass each year amount to more than ten million dollars. In the past, they were all remitted by the post office. The goods sent out of the pass by parcel post through the post office were also numerous. Since the September 18th Incident, our government, based on the great plan of the nation, resolutely blockaded postal services in the northeast. Three years have passed, and international opinions have shifted. However, considering that the compatriots outside the pass are in a desperate situation, postal delivery is blocked, parcels are cut off, and remittances are suspended, the impact on the balance of the national economy and the flow of goods and financial information is not small. The pain of the people living outside the pass and their relatives and friends within the pass is even more imaginable. I, Zigang, have served in the post office for 20 years. Although I am retired, I have the country and the people in my heart. I always cherish the great wish to strive for a win-win solution between the great plan of our government and the interests of the people. At Shanhaiguan and Gubeikou, I will organize a Transfer and Delivery Bureau as a merchant to transfer incoming and outgoing letters and parcels and remittances, charging commissions to cover expenses. All matters that should be handled by Zigang will be handled responsibly, and I am willing to provide a guarantee and sign a contract to show good faith. Respectfully submitted to the Postal Administration, Huang Zigang. It is heard that after receiving Huang Zigang's petition, the Postal Administration has ordered the Hebei Management Bureau to contact and negotiate the contract to undertake the business.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Zhuang Xueben Returned to Shanghai After Surveying the Borderlands <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Talks About the Customs and Culture of the Golok Region</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that Mr. Zhuang Xueben, a special commissioner for northwest surveying of the Northwest Development Association, followed Mr. Huang Musong, a special envoy sent to pay respects to the Dalai Lama, to various places on the border of Sichuan in March of last year to conduct surveys. After arriving in Chengdu, Mr. Zhuang parted ways with Mr. Huang and, together with a translator and two attendants, traveled at his own expense to the wild regions bordering the provinces of Western Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan, risking danger to conduct surveys. He passed through Guanxian, Wenchuan, Lifan, Wutun, Sidu, Aba, grasslands, and arrived at Golok, where he stayed for two months. Then, he followed the Yellow River eastward to Songpan, and then went south along the Minjiang River, spending six months in total, going deep into barren lands, climbing mountains and wading through rivers, enduring extreme hardship. He took many photos and left Chengdu on December 18th to return to Beijing, arriving in Shanghai on New Year's Day this year. Yesterday at 4 PM, colleagues from the Pudong Qichangzhan Security Corps held a banquet to congratulate Mr. Zhuang on his success and to listen to his narration of the survey process. Zhang Mingqin, Xu Baoming, Shen Xingyuan, Zhang Zaibo, Li Guanlin, Hu Baizhou, Chen Fusheng, Wu Zilong, Huang Jingwan, Zhu Shuren, Shen Xingyuan, and others, more than 60 people, attended. During the banquet, Mr. Zhuang spoke about his journey, saying, "The place I visited this time, with Golok as the end point, has never been visited by Han Chinese, so there is very little description in our country's history and geography. Even if there is, it is not detailed. Golok has more than 100,000 people, all of whom are extremely uncivilized. Their property consists only of cattle and sheep, and money is useless. Therefore, I (Zhuang claims himself) bought many pieces of cloth early and exchanged them for things after entering the area. After that, I relied on this to survive. Men, except for being soldiers and hunting, specialize in stealing other people's cattle and sheep, which has almost become a habit. Women have extremely high rights and can order men at any time. All housework is handled by them. In the morning, they take all the cattle and sheep to places with water and grass and return at noon, then milk them and cook, and eat with their husbands. The main food is beef and mutton, and the way of eating is very strange, and most of them eat it half raw. These people like to drink Sichuan twig tea, selling about 30,000 packets a year, more than 100 catties per packet. They wear a sheepskin jacket, regardless of the hot summer or cold winter, they never wash or change it. They wear it during the day and use it as a quilt at night. When it's hot, they are all naked, their upper bodies are covered with sweat and grease, and they smell bad. The wives of the chieftains are very extravagant, with hair crowns made of agate and coral, and their whole bodies are covered in silk, worth at least more than 10,000 yuan. Their residences are tents made of yak hair ropes, and they all sleep in the same place, regardless of whether they are masters or servants. The people are born with iron muscles and bones, and they are not afraid of wind, frost, rain, or snow. Sometimes they even sleep in the open on the grass, and they rarely get sick. They rely entirely on cattle and horses for transportation, and their skills are very high. They all believe in Lamaism. If there are four sons in a family, they must send two to study Lamaism. These people specialize in chanting scriptures for people and live a good life. Among them, the living Buddha is the most revered. Every move he makes is regarded as a god. When he goes out for a walk, the people all prostrate themselves on the side of the road and hope that the living Buddha will whip them on the back, saying that this will eliminate all sins in their lives. Some people even take the excrement and urine of the living Buddha home and eat it, saying that this can prolong life. There is a living Buddha who is more than 130 years old, who came from a beggar. Because he was extremely poor and bored, he went around spreading rumors and claiming that he was powerful and could cure all diseases. He actually gained the support of many people, so he became tyrannical and openly married a wife and a concubine and had more than a dozen daughters. Marriage is extremely free in the Golok region. At the end of each year, a large number of men and women gather and choose freely. If both parties agree, they can marry. The selection must also be appropriate. The son of a chieftain must marry the daughter of a chieftain, which has almost become a law. If there is no suitable partner for a while, they will choose one from the sisters of their mother to marry. Some people, fearing that their family property will be dispersed, have several brothers marry one wife together. The date of cohabitation is determined by the woman. Whoever's turn it is on a certain day, the rest will go out to work. The first son is called the eldest brother the father, and the second son is called the second brother the father, and the rest are called uncles, so there are never any disputes. When a person dies, they are usually sky buried, and the corpse is thrown naked into the wilderness for birds to peck at. The nobles are mostly cremated. The people despise the Han Chinese," and so on. Then, Zhang Mingqin, Hu Baizhou, Huang Jingwan, and others gave speeches of encouragement, and the banquet ended at about 10 o'clock. Finally, Mr. Zhuang told the reporter that he had collected very detailed information about the customs and culture of the Golok region and took many photos. He plans to write a special book for those who study border issues to refer to. If there is an opportunity, he plans to risk danger again to survey the barren lands of Yunnan, Qinghai, and Mongolia, but this is beyond the financial resources of an individual. He hopes that compatriots can provide material and spiritual assistance to achieve his humble wishes. He is especially grateful to Mr. Huang Jingwan and Mr. Hu Baizhou for their assistance in this trip to Sichuan. He will think of ways to contribute to the country and society in the future and live up to everyone's expectations. Finally, he hopes that young people across the country will travel more to the borderlands and not just shout to go to the northwest while clinging to the pleasures of the city. At this time when the national crisis is deepening, the border situation is what we urgently want to know. As citizens, we should fulfill our civic obligations. If the government can find ways to encourage us, then cooperation between the government and the people will bring a lot of help to the development of the northwest in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Rural Loans <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Drought Disaster Relief Association, led by Xu Shiying and others, initiated a proposal for the Shanghai banking community to organize a rural loan group. Yesterday, they published an outline and explanation, stating: "Our country has always been known for its agricultural foundation. In recent decades, internal turmoil has been incessant, governance has been complicated, and taxes have been heavy, leaving the people without a stable existence. Nearly all the money in rural areas has flowed into government offices and cities, and has been exported abroad. Imports exceed exports, and there has been no development of gold and silver mines. The limited resources are on the verge of depletion. Furthermore, successive years of droughts and floods, and the rampant activities of communist bandits, have reduced those with average wealth to extreme poverty, and have turned the extremely poor into bandits. Without immediate relief, the total collapse of society is imminent and unavoidable. Last year, Mr. Zhang Gongquan of the Bank of China already gave a speech entitled 'Go to the Countryside,' which deeply hit the mark. The Shanghai Banking Association also established a Rural Finance Adjustment Committee. The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank has independently focused on rural loans, diligently experimenting and achieving considerable results. However, the effectiveness has not yet been widespread, and it is not helping the entire countryside. Why is this? It is because there is no large-scale joint organization of official, commercial, and banking entities to provide joint relief. It is now proposed that the Central Bank allocate funds to promote this, and that all commercial banks rise up and catch up to jointly address this critical situation. The revival of the countryside can then be hoped for. Some say that the Central Bank is not a direct business operation. This is indeed the case. However, they do not know that agriculture is the foundation of the country. If the countryside goes bankrupt, how can the nation stand? Rising up to rescue it is an inescapable duty. Moreover, this involves allocating funds for rural lending, not the bank itself directly engaging in business operations. This is the meaning stipulated in Articles 1, 2, and 3 of this outline. Some say that commercial banks are not charitable organizations, and cannot recklessly throw the shareholders' capital and depositors' money into poor and remote areas, where it would be easy to lend but difficult to recover. This is also indeed the case. However, loans must have secure collateral and guarantees, so the concerns should be allayed. This is the meaning stipulated in Articles 5 and 6 of this outline. In summary, if this proposal is not implemented, even if hundreds of millions of dollars are raised annually for passive relief, it will ultimately be of no avail. Furthermore, with all industries in decline, and merchants and the people in distress, fundraising has already reached its limit.

<h3 id="e146">Red Swastika Society Reports the Tragic Situation in the Disaster Area of Jiangxi Province <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Rats are bigger than cats… Mosquitoes and fleas jump around.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society's relief teams, Teams One and Two, have arrived in Jiangxi one after the other, and all the relief supplies have also been continuously transported there. It is reported that the General Office of the Society in Shanghai received a report yesterday from Zhou Zongliang, the head of the team, regarding the tragic situation in the disaster area, which is unbearable to witness. Excerpts are as follows: (Omitted above) Zongliang departed from the provincial capital on the morning of December 28th, accompanied by Team Leaders Han and Li, Team Captain Nie, Team Member Peng, Doctor Wen Chi, and eleven servants, traveling by car along the highway. That afternoon, they arrived in Nancheng, and at 5:00 PM, they arrived in Nanfeng, staying at Dechanghao, managed by Qian He. They met with County Magistrate Liu and Police Officer Mei, and learned that the Kutou area of the county was still unsettled and being suppressed. There were about 3,000 refugees who were homeless. This morning, they departed for Guangchang, which was a newly recovered area in June of the 23rd year. The area was lost and regained three times, resulting in the most deaths and injuries. Although the corpses were buried by the army, they were all covered with loose soil. Without heavy work, the epidemic could not be eliminated. Those who survived were all elderly, weak, disabled, hungry, and cold. Their faces were colorless. The disaster victims mostly suffered from malaria, dysentery, and beriberi. In the entire county, there were no strong men or women. This tragic situation could not be believed without witnessing it firsthand. On the way, they encountered a disaster victim holding a bowl of rice, lying on the side of the road, barely breathing, still struggling to get up. They were planning to find a way to save him, but before they could, he died. That evening, they stayed at the Pingmin Grand Hotel, whose buildings were all piled up with mud, and the stench was overwhelming, making them want to vomit. County Magistrate Hui and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce came to meet them. According to them, a month ago, dozens of people were found dead on the road every day, so seeing one person was not unusual. It can be seen that the lives of the disaster victims in the county were hanging by a thread. Without urgent relief, they would not be able to survive. County Magistrate Hui was very happy to hear that the association had brought clothing, rice, food, medical supplies, doctors, etc. He also asked if there were any rat poison because after the disaster, the rats were larger than cats and were a nuisance everywhere, impossible to catch. The disaster victims compared them to large insects. Even more strange was that in the severe winter weather, there were still mosquitoes and flies rampant. The team could not sleep peacefully, and the rats were even more vicious. In addition to mosquitoes and rats, there were also soil fleas jumping around. These mosquitoes and fleas sucked human blood and could be a medium for malaria. Therefore, medical work is currently critical, but the fundamental way to reduce the epidemic is to kill rats and mosquitoes. It is not considered successful without doing so. They originally planned to go directly to Ningdu, but that night, it rained heavily. Guangchang to Ningdu was only 120 li, but the roads were all made of piled-up mud and had to pass over 18 li of mountain ridges. Heavy vehicles could not travel. It was heard that military vehicles had already overturned. They had no choice but to return to the province. The next morning, they departed from the province. The rain had not stopped. After the car passed Nancheng, although the road was very flat, the mud was soaked with rainwater, and the stones were exposed. While driving, the car suddenly swerved and slid to the side of the pond, only half a foot away from the pond water. Fortunately, the engine was stopped, avoiding an accident. Along the way, there were no signs of human habitation. In the rain and snow, they took more than a dozen photos of the disaster area. After they are developed, they will bring them back. They passed through a village with very large houses, right next to the road, but there was no one there. In the hall, there was a corpse, only the clothes and bones were visible. Upon repeated examination, it was about one or two years old. No one knew who the family was. Everywhere, there were remains and skeletons. In addition, this year there were droughts and floods, and the fields were barren. The severity of the disaster was unparalleled. On the 29th, they stayed in Fuzhou, and on the 31st, they returned to the province safely. An investigation revealed that there were more than 60 counties in the disaster area of Jiangxi. The counties in southern and eastern Jiangxi had been devastated and were also hit by drought, resulting in an extremely tragic disaster situation. They planned to first select the two counties of Guangchang and Ningdu, located in southern Jiangxi near Fujian, to handle first. They had already dispatched Teams One and Two, one after the other, to Guangchang and Ningdu. However, the disaster area is vast and there are many disaster victims. They deeply hope that the gentlemen in Shanghai who live in luxurious houses and have ample food and clothing will take a look at the disaster area and understand the misery of human hell.</p>

<p>Municipal Zoo</p>
<h3 id="e147">Purchasing Seven Major Animals <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Expanding the Park Area and Building Lion and Elephant Houses</p>
<p>Will Purchase Zebras, Seals, and Seven Other Animals</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Zoo more than a year ago, the zoo has been working hard to expand its facilities. The zoo has recently been approved by the municipal government for this year's expansion plan, which includes purchasing various new animals. The details of the plan are excerpted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e148">Purchasing Novel Animals <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The zoo currently only has large animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, wolves, bears, elephants, camels, and sika deer. For the purpose of expansion, the zoo has specifically requested and been approved by the municipal government to purchase seven major animals in the first half of this year, including zebras, rhinoceroses, polar bears, seals, chimpanzees, ostriches, and giraffes. Director Shen of the zoo has already studied the purchase and transportation process, and will submit a request to the municipal government for funds to implement the plan to purchase novel animals. It is expected that they will be transported to Shanghai in the first half of this year for public viewing.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Commencing Construction of Animal Houses <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The current area occupied by the zoo is only a little over seven mu. Recently, though, an additional seven fen of neighboring land has been purchased nearby, but it is still not sufficient. As a result, the elephant and camel houses are temporarily constructed with wooden planks and reed sheds, which is not suitable for the animals' living conditions. The newly purchased land will be used to build houses for elephants and camels. In the future, zebras, chimpanzees, and other animals can also be housed there. The designs for the houses have been completed, and construction is scheduled to begin this spring. Once construction is completed, other animals such as wolves, monkeys, wild boars, etc., will also be moved into the new houses.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Heating Equipment Installed <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The zoo's animals, such as snakes and crocodiles, are all tropical species, and some are hibernating animals. In view of this cold winter weather, the zoo specifically requested and was approved by the municipal government to replace the original water radiators, which were not suitable for tropical and hibernating animals, with heating equipment by the Bureau of Public Works. The installation was completed yesterday. The heating can maintain a temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit, so even if it is snowing heavily outside, the internal temperature can be maintained above 60 degrees.</p>
<p>Muslims in the City</p>
<h3 id="e151">Observing the Eid al-Fitr Ritual This Morning <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Muslims in the city must fast for one month every year during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. The intention is to restrain food and lust in order to be careful about desires. Every year, according to the calculation of the Kaaba, the Earth revolves around the Sun for 365 and a quarter days, which is called a year. The moon becomes full twelve times, which is 354 and a third days, which is called a year. A year is used to calculate human affairs, all ceremonies should follow 12 months, the ninth month of every year is the month of fasting. During this month, diet should be restricted and sexual activity completely abstained. This is meant to be an exercise in restraint and desire. Before the fast, there must be a determination. Without a sincere determination, there will be no success. With an improper determination, the success will be distorted. Each virtuous act must start with an intention. So, Muslims during this month must eat before dawn and only break the fast after sunset. There is one month of fasting, one month is thirty days, one month is twenty-nine days, observing the lunar cycle. One must wait until dawn, after breaking the fast, to compensate the fast. Today (7th), Muslim followers have reached the end of fasting, each must shower, wear perfume, and put on clean clothes, pay "Saudak" (a form of alms giving), those with savings of more than forty silver dollars must give one dollar to charity, the charity will be distributed to relatives (excluding parents, grandparents, children), neighbours, countrymen, distribute according to amount, or subsidise cultural activities, no sending alms to distant places, but distant relatives are accepted. Recite praises, each follower is to gather at the Zhejiang Road Mosque, Fuyou Road Mosque, Xiaotaoyuan Mosque, Xiaoshadu Mosque, Xieqiao Mosque, Xiaonanmen Mosque, and at more than ten other mosques to hold a big ceremony. The missionary will give a lecture on teachings and welcome attendees to visit.</p>

<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was instructed by the Ministry of Transportation to encourage schools to organize tour groups to visit factories or schools in various places to promote the effectiveness of education. The company has formulated the following preferential measures, which are detailed below.</p>

<p>The suggestion for the preferential treatment measures was jointly submitted by six colleges, including National Peiping University, Peiping Wuhan University, and Peiping Institute of Technology, to the Ministry of Education. In order to encourage education and provide preferential treatment for student travel, they specifically requested that the Ministry forward their request to the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways to provide free preferential treatment in accordance with the practice of Jiaotong University. After receiving the request, the Ministry of Education forwarded it to the two ministries for review and implementation. However, the Ministry of Railways stated that it was restricted by its regulations and could not comply. The Ministry of Transportation instructed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to properly formulate measures for implementation.</p>

<p>Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhang Erlang, also known as Zhang Erlong, a native of Haimen residing at No. 90 Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, is 25 years old this year. He was originally the son of the Chen family, but was adopted by his aunt from childhood, hence the surname Zhang. He was previously an electrician at a French-owned Electric Company. In the summer of last year, he was dismissed due to collusion with Father Du and the Lu Qin Feng Textile Factory to steal electricity. However, during his time at the Electric Company, Zhang earned a high monthly income. In addition to marrying a wife, Shi, he also took a concubine, Dong. However, he still could not satisfy his desires. He coveted Ding Lanying, a young and beautiful maid from his hometown whom he employed. In the winter of the 21st year, he enlisted two matchmakers, Qin Sen and Shi Zhongxiao, from his hometown to propose marriage to Ding's parents. They falsely claimed that Zhang was about to divorce his wife and was willing to marry Lanying. Initially, Ding's father, Ding Youxin, refused because Zhang already had a wife and concubine. However, due to the continuous entanglement of the matchmakers and Zhang's solemn vows, he agreed to the request. Thus, on the sixth day of the twelfth lunar month of that year, both parties drafted a marriage contract and became engaged. Zhang presented a bride price of eight dollars. At that time, the girl was</p>

<p>Jian Hao, a Guangdong native, snuck into the Hongkou small vegetable market at 5:40 AM. He tried to steal beef from the stall of Tang Liansheng, a Pudong native, but failed, leading to an argument.

Patrolman No. 1088 arrived after hearing the commotion and arrested Jian, taking him and the knife to the Hongkou Police Station. The arrest was reported to the police chief, who ordered Jian's detention. The injured Tang was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was minor, and he was discharged after being bandaged. The next morning, Jian was sent to the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department presented the facts and the weapon and requested prosecution. Tang Liansheng testified about what happened. When questioned, the defendant stammered. Judge Jiang reviewed the evidence and sentenced Jian Hao to six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<p>Refugee Numbers Surge, Capacity Insufficient</p>
<p>Shouting and Noise Could Easily Cause Trouble</p>
<p>Currently Negotiating to Open Another Soup Kitchen</p>
<p>Reason for Closure Reported to the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Zhabei Charity Association opened the second soup kitchen on Liuying Road on the morning of January 1st at 6:00 AM. Reports of the extraordinary crowding of soup drinkers have been documented in the press. The association reports that the number of refugees has been increasing daily, making the second Liuying Road facility unable to accommodate them. The resulting shouting and noise have led to a tense situation, forcing the association to temporarily close the kitchen the previous morning. The situation is described below:</p>
<h3 id="e160">Number of Soup-Drinking Poor Explodes <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>When the association opened the soup kitchen on the morning of January 1st, it initially distributed six dan of rice, cooked into ten cauldrons of soup. However, the number of refugees reached over 3,000, making the supply insufficient. The association's director, Wang Binyan, distributed nine copper coins to each person after the soup ran out to resolve the situation. The next day, the association increased the rice supply to eighteen dan, believing it would meet the demand. However, the number of refugees increased to over 12,000, and there was still not enough soup for everyone. The association once again resorted to distributing copper coins.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Sudden Announcement of Closure <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>For months, the number of refugees has continued to increase, making the second Liuying Road facility unable to accommodate them. Even with an increase to twenty-six dan of rice, there were still those who missed out, leading to shouting and noise and a very tense situation. Therefore, the association had no choice but to announce the temporary closure of the soup kitchen starting the morning before yesterday, fearing that the refugees might use the situation to cause trouble. The Shanghai North Security Corps sent a team to maintain order. However, some elderly refugees were still given copper coins. The refugees reluctantly dispersed by 10:00 AM, and fortunately, no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Post-Closure Negotiations Underway <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Although the soup kitchen has closed, the refugees are hungry and unable to eat. Yesterday morning, before 5:00 AM, many people gathered outside the Liuying Road soup kitchen. The association sent people in advance to the entrance to explain the situation to the refugees, who gradually dispersed. The scene was quite tragic. A reporter from the Datong News Agency then went to the association's headquarters on Datong Road to inquire about the post-closure arrangements. According to the staff, Director Wang Binyan has visited Wang Yiting, the chairman of the Shanghai Charity Organization Federation, to discuss solutions and plans to open another soup kitchen nearby to provide relief and prevent trouble. The association has also reported the reason for the closure to the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>Due to the Financial Bureau's Increase in Spring License Fees</p>
<p>A Joint Petition will be Submitted to Request a Temporary Delay in the Increase</p>
<p>The five trade associations of the Shanghai tobacco and alcohol industry recently held a joint meeting on the afternoon of 4:30 PM because the Financial Bureau had begun collecting spring tobacco and alcohol license fees and had increased the amount, which was difficult to bear. Representatives from the tobacco exchange, including Chen Liangyu, Chen Ruilin, Qian Wenda, Zhang Songji, and Mi Chuxin; tobacco and alcohol industry representatives Xie Zhendong and Zeng Tangshen; local yellow wine industry representative Fang Zhongheng; sauce and preserves industry representatives Chen Weiwen and Zhang Dalian; and Shaoxing wine industry representative Zhang Qingfang attended the meeting. Chen Liangyu was elected chairman, and Zhang Jinzhi was the recorder. After formalities, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Zhang Song reported that the collection of spring tobacco and alcohol licenses had begun and that the tobacco industry had reported an increased burden due to investigator reports. The association convened the joint meeting to discuss relief measures. Zhang Dalian, the representative of the sauce and wine industry, reported on the license acquisition process for each member. After detailed discussion, the representatives agreed that the members of each industry were experiencing poor business and were already unable to bear the winter tobacco and alcohol licenses. If the fees were increased again, it would be impossible for the industries to pay. To protect the interests of the industries, it was unanimously decided that the chairman would lead a joint petition from the associations to the Financial Bureau to maintain the status quo to show consideration for the difficulties of businesses. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>Jiang Yuan Lost Her Mind</p>
<p>Suddenly Sends Her Son to His Death</p>
<p>Jiang Jinkui, from Suzhou, runs a bamboo chopstick shop at No. 21 Xinjie, Xuejia浜 Road, outside Xiaonanmen in Nanshi. He is married to Yuan, 39 years old, and they have had four children. Their eldest son, Fugeng, was unfortunately abducted by bandits at the age of eight and has never been found. The second child was a daughter who died of illness last year. Therefore, only two young children remain: Fuyuan, six years old, and Asi, only two months old. However, Yuan has a history of mental illness that comes and goes. The family is poor and lacks the resources to cure the root of the illness. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yuan's old illness relapsed. She suddenly started waving her hands and feet, crying and laughing incoherently. Her family did not pay much attention. Soon, Yuan grabbed her lively and adorable young son, Asi, from the bed, opened the window, and threw him straight onto the street from the front of the building. As a result, the child's head hit a stone on the street, shattering it instantly, and his brains splattered out. He cried out in agony and died. At the time, Yuan was standing upstairs, witnessing her beloved son's tragic death. Instead of crying in pain, she laughed out loud. The local police heard about the incident and rushed to the scene. They immediately took Yuan to the Dongjiadu Police Station under their jurisdiction. During the preliminary interrogation by the station chief, Yuan's answers were not relevant to the questions. Because the incident involved causing death by negligence, the police prepared a document the next morning and sent it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning. However, if Yuan was indeed suffering from a mental illness, then, according to the criminal law's provision that actions of those who have lost their minds are not punishable, it is different from manslaughter by negligence. However, according to the law, considering the circumstances, she may be subject to imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Bandit Commits Suicide in Detention Out of Fear of Punishment <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Bao Shuji, a Chinese detective at the Hongkou Police Station, along with Western detectives, arrested five bandits from Jiangbei, including Wang Zhongde, Wu Qingcai, Qin Chunlian, Gu Baoyin, and Liu Xiaowuzi, at teahouses and Maigen Road at No. 43, Lane 460, Aven Avenue on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month. Two Mauser pistols and nine bullets were found on Wang and Wu. They were taken to the police station and detained. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the Public Works Department stated that the defendants were related to the armed robbery of the Mao Jinji Watch Shop at No. 29 Pan Road at 7:40 PM on December 25th of last year. Wang and Wu each had a watch and three pawn tickets. He requested a postponement for detailed investigation. The guns, bullets, and evidence were presented for inspection. Han Xianyi, an apprentice at the shop, testified that fifty-five watches and three gold rings were robbed at the time and identified Wang Zhongde and Wu Qingcai as the robbers. Wang held a Mauser pistol and threatened them into silence, also stealing watches. When questioned, Wang Zhongde stammered. Wu Qingcai admitted to going to the robbery with Wang and that the watch was indeed stolen. Qin, Gu, and Liu denied the charges. Judge Xiao ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation. Wang, who was 36 years old, tore his clothes into strips in the detention center of the police station at around 2:00 AM yesterday morning and hanged himself on the gate out of fear of punishment. Officer No. 504 discovered the suicide and informed the police chief, who ordered him to be sent to the police hospital for emergency treatment, but he was already dead. The body was transported to the autopsy center on Fielun Road. Prosecutor Tang from the court arrived at the center and confirmed that Wang Zhongde, a male, had committed suicide by hanging. Since no family members could be found, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Property Dispute at the Samsung Stage <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Pang Laichen and Others Counter-Sue Qiu Zijia and Others</p>
<p>Zhou Bingchen, Zhao Ruquan, and the deceased Huang Chujiu jointly founded the Samsung Business Company, leasing land from Pang Laichen on Niuzhuang Road to build the Samsung Stage Theater and market houses for rent. Later, Huang passed away, and Zhou and Zhao developed ill feelings. The company's assets were incorporated into Zhou's. Last fall, due to business failure and mounting debts, including tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid rent, Zhou sold the theater and market houses to Pang for $270,000. Not long after the transaction, Qiu Zijia and other creditors of the Gongfa Company, founded by Huang Chujiu, heard about it. They argued that since Huang was one of the shareholders of Samsung, the assets of Samsung should be jointly owned by Huang and could not be disposed of by Zhou alone. They hired lawyer Dong Yu to submit a petition to the Second Special District Court, which was forwarded to the First Special District Court, requesting the sealing of the property and instructing all tenants to deposit rent payments with the court on a regular basis pending review of the disposition. This decision was greatly disadvantageous to Pang Laichen, who then hired lawyer Qin Liankui to file a lawsuit against Qiu Zijia and others, raising an objection to the enforcement. First, the suit stated that the Samsung Company leased land from him to build the houses and that he had filed a lawsuit in court to force Zhou Bingchen to pay the rent owed. It described how Zhou took over the original leased property in September and paid to buy the buildings on the land because he was heavily in debt and unable to support himself. Then, the suit argued the legal principles in detail, stating that Qiu and others had no right to request enforcement because Huang Chujiu's shares had already been incorporated into Zhou's, so the defendants had no right to enforce the Samsung property. Finally, the suit requested a judgment: (1) the property in dispute should not be subject to enforcement for Huang Chujiu's debts; (2) the defendant's request for enforcement should be deemed an infringement and they should be held liable for damages; and (3) the defendants should bear the costs of the litigation. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Judge Peng Shi of the First Special Court held a hearing. After the plaintiff's lawyer stated the reasons for the lawsuit and presented the written evidence, requesting review, the defendant's lawyer also made a rebuttal. Judge Peng ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Appeal of Russian Murderer Rejected <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Russian Pi Anjin Xia Gufu (transliteration, 29 years old) was a soldier under Zhang Zongchang of the Feng Army and had a feud with his platoon leader, La Fulao Fu Ni Gula (transliteration, 34 years old), who was of the same race. After disbandment, Pi came to Shanghai to seek a living, while La traveled to the three northeastern provinces, Harbin, Tianjin, Hankou, and other ports. He came to Shanghai at the end of October of last year. At around 10:00 PM on November 3rd, the two met in Lane 855 of Xiafei Road in the French Concession. Pi pulled out a sharp blade and stabbed La in the back three times before fleeing. La went to the Gongji Hospital for treatment and reported the incident. The French police arrested Pi and sent him to the Second Special Court. He was initially charged with assault and detained. La died of his injuries on the 13th of that month. The police changed the charge to premeditated murder and filed a public prosecution. The result of the trial was that Pi Anjin Xia Gufu was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Pi did not accept the verdict and filed an appeal with the High Court's Third Branch. The High Court's panel of judges conducted a final hearing and determined that the appellant's appeal was without merit. Judge Guo, along with Associate Judges Sun and Fan and Prosecutor Zhang, opened a court session and ordered the appellant, Pi Anjin Xia Gufu, to be brought to court. The appeal was rejected. After the verdict, he was remanded to the detention center to await the third instance appeal period before being sent to prison for execution.</p>

<p>A total of one hundred and thirty-one new rickshaws were operating on the roads yesterday. Eighty-three of them were manufactured by Feixing Motor Vehicle Company. The remaining forty-eight were manufactured by various rickshaw companies according to the new style stipulated by the Public Works Bureau. After the rickshaw merchants verified the original style, they were sent to the vehicle inspection office on Gongping Road for inspection and approval. The original old vehicles were then transferred to the new vehicles for rental. As a result, new vehicles galloped along the roads yesterday, and passengers felt comfortable and convenient.</p>

The wings are made of black steel sheet. The white cloth spring cushions and rubber-lined footrests, and black lacquer car beams are beautifully constructed. They are also lighter, softer, and more comfortable than the old style when riding. According to sources in the rickshaw industry, these new-style vehicles are still being manufactured continuously so that all vehicles in the Special District can be replaced with the new style.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Violence by the Thirty-Six Gangs <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Assault After Extortion Fails</p>
<p>In the city, the Nanshi district, and other areas of this city, there is a type of hooligan commonly known as the Thirty-Six Gangs. Whenever a new shop opens, a house is being built or demolished, or there is a wedding or funeral, these people must demand a cut. If they are not satisfied, they will cause trouble. Even those who run small stalls must pay a certain amount each month, or else they will forcibly buy goods or commit other evils. Because these gangs have many followers, people do not dare to argue with them. As a result, the bandits become more rampant. Yesterday morning, Pan Guizheng, who runs a fish stall on Ninghe Road in the city, was asked by these hooligans to pay a cut. Pan replied that business was slow, and his family's livelihood was already barely sufficient, politely refusing them. The hooligans harbored a grudge and left in anger. After Pan closed his stall, he was walking through the Xiaotaoyuan area when the gang rushed up to him, led by a man nicknamed "White-Eyed Monk," and demanded six yuan. Pan did not have the money to pay, so he was surrounded and beaten. The gang punched and kicked him. Pan cried for help. When the police arrived, the hooligans had already fled without a trace. Pan reported the incident to the police station under his jurisdiction, requesting an investigation. According to reports, these hooligans use a certain stove shop in the area as their headquarters and spend all day there, posing a threat to the area. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>

The association's letter to fellow traders for disaster relief is recorded below: Although we who are engaged in business in Shanghai can still make a living amidst the current economic depression, we must look back at the rural areas in the interior. The economic bankruptcy is severe in many places, which is unbearable. The disaster victims in the disaster areas eat tree bark and grass roots to fill their hunger. Who in Shanghai can know this kind of misery? The severe winter is approaching, and the disaster victims still have no cotton clothes to wear, waiting for people to rescue them. People in Shanghai are donating money to help. We fellow traders are also Chinese citizens. How can we sit idly by and not save the disaster victims who are crying out for food? Therefore, this association is specifically requesting all fellow traders to find a way to donate some money to help disaster victims based on their charitable conscience. Saving a life increases blessings and longevity. For payment of donations, please go directly to the Urgent Relief Association for handling. Please all fellow traders in Shanghai rise up to help disaster relief!</p>

<p>Li Zhifan Reports on the Future Direction of the University</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) Since the board meeting held last year, Qilu University in this city has hired Mei Yibao as president.

Recently, Zhu Youru, a director of the university, passed through Jinan from Beijing on his way to Beiping. According to reports, Kong has agreed to take office as chairman, so Li has also agreed to assume the position of president. Students welcomed Li's announcement. Classes resumed on the 4th, and the Qilu University storm has come to an end. On the 4th, Li Zhifan went to the Department of Education to report on the beginning and end of his acting presidency and the future direction of the university, asking the department for guidance. He also inquired about how to receive the 5,000 yuan that the provincial government assists the university with each year. Director He Siyuan and Chief Secretary Wang Jinxin received him, and the main points of the conversation were as follows: (1) Consolidate the foundation of the school. Li said that Qilu University's 500,000 yuan in funding all came from donations from foreign churches. However, the nature of the donations may not be sustainable in the long term. If it is interrupted, the university's affairs will be suspended. The point about consolidating the foundation of the school is very important. In the future, he plans to first organize an alumni association. More than 1,000 people have graduated from Qilu University over the years and are scattered throughout the country. He wants to organize them, protect the alma mater, and appoint responsible committee members. If each person contributes a minimum of 50 yuan per year, then there will be 50,000 yuan, which is a small supplement. In addition, the university's construction committee has also decided to improve the board of directors, limiting the number of directors to 15, with 10 Chinese and 5 foreigners, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, to be responsible for running the university, so as to avoid being scattered and disorganized.</p>
<p>(2) The school goes to the countryside. The current government's education methods focus on the countryside, and the general opinion is also the same. Furthermore, the foreign church that is responsible for Qilu University's funding holds two meetings each year. Recently, it also stated that spending a large sum of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan each year to run an ordinary university is not very meaningful and advocated that the school go to the countryside. Due to these various relationships, Qilu University's future direction will follow this trend, but there is absolutely no plan to change the College of Arts and Sciences into a rural normal school. Students heard this rumor and became uneasy, repeatedly questioning the school. The school has made a clear statement that the future direction of the school will focus on the countryside, but there is absolutely no plan to change the College of Arts and Sciences into a normal school.</p>
<p>(3) Make up for the school's deficit. Before President Mei Yibao arrives at the school, Li's term as acting president will be half a year, calculated until the end of the academic year on June 23rd of this year. The school's deficit is about 40,000 yuan. Fortunately, this number is not very large and does not seem to be a problem. Moreover, the Qilu University Construction Committee has also decided to find ways to assist the school's finances, and it may not be difficult to raise 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) The problem of the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. After Li agreed to take the position of acting president, he sent a letter to President Mei Yibao to report. Mei replied, saying that he would submit his resignation from the position of president of Mingxian College in Taigu at the upcoming board meeting and may come to Jinan during the summer vacation. Currently, the only problem is Lin Jiqing, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Acting President Li hopes that Lin will return to the school to take office. The students have also sent Lin a telegram welcoming him. However, Lin has not yet expressed his opinion. Lin's contract as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences was for five years and expired in March of last year. If Lin is to be rehired, another five-year contract must be signed. However, Li's term as acting president is only half a year, and he is afraid to hire a dean of the College of Arts and Sciences with a five-year term, so he has consulted with Mei Yibao. There has not yet been a reply. It is likely that the school can rehire him, but he is not sure whether Lin will agree to take office. The Department of Education reported to the Ministry of Education that the students of the College of Arts and Sciences have already started classes and that someone is responsible for the president's duties. The department specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Education to report the situation. Also, on the afternoon of the 4th, Li Zhifan convened a meeting of all faculty and staff of the College of Arts, Sciences, and Medicine to discuss the direction of progress.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Youth Problem Discussion Held Yesterday <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Discussion Problems Divided into Four Groups</p>
<p>Instructors Invited to Explain Separately</p>
<p>The High School Outstanding Student Fellowship Movement sponsored by the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department held a youth problem discussion at the auditorium of Wuben Girls' High School yesterday. Tong Xingbai, Tai Shuangqiu, Yang Weiyu, and Zhang Yiping were invited to serve as instructors and answer questions separately. The details of each are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e216">Participating Schools <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>A total of more than 200 students from over 40 schools including Jingye, Wuben, Fudan, Nanyang, Minli, Daxia, Guanghua, Qingxin, Nangaon, Chizhi, Qingnianhui, Mailun, Fushi, Xinlu, Peiming, Tongji, Datong, Lida, Qiaoguang, Jianguo, Dongya, Zhengfeng, Xinmin, Dagong, Kaiming, Zhirenyong, Private Shanghai High School, Shanghai Kindergarten Teacher School, Hujiang, Minli Girls' High School, Huahua, Yuqing, China Vocational School, and Cihang Midwifery School attended.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Committee Member Tao Reports <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The meeting opened at 2:00 PM. Chairman Tao Baichuan, Committee Member, received Yu Zhongbiao, Wang Longzhang, and others. The chairman first reported, stating briefly that today is the third session of the High School Outstanding Student Fellowship Movement sponsored by the Municipal Party Department. The fourth fellowship movement will not be held this semester due to examination issues. The fourth session was originally scheduled to visit the Municipal Government and pay tribute to the Wusong War Zone. If the students are willing to participate, it will be held together when the outstanding first-year high school students are received next semester. Today is a discussion meeting. Before the meeting, there will be a simple test with questions about thoughts and knowledge, which can be used as a reference for education. Due to time constraints, the speeches will be stopped. Students will first raise questions, and then the instructors will answer them.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Further Education and Reading <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>The first group is further education and reading.</p>
<p>The discussion question is how to enable poor students to pursue further education. Students first discussed together, followed by instructor Tai Shuangqiu's opinion, stating briefly that in his personal feelings, it is necessary for young people to contribute to the country and society in the future, and further education is of course necessary, but it is also possible without further education. Those who pursue further education do not necessarily read books, and those who read books do not necessarily pursue further education, such as Edison in the United States and Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press in China, who have not pursued further education, which is one example. Therefore, the idea that you cannot read books without money should be corrected by aspiring young people. However, how to enable young people with economic difficulties to pursue further education should be the result of efforts in many aspects such as government, society, and education. As for the methods: (1) Mutual assistance for further education; (2) Subsidized further education. Finally, he hopes that everyone will not be discouraged and at the same time hopes that they will not think that they cannot read books without further education.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Employment and Service <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The second group is employment and service.</p>
<p>The discussion question is how to enable secondary school graduates to obtain suitable jobs. Instructor Yang Weiyu gave his opinion, stating briefly that there are a total of twenty-nine questions in the employment and service group, but many are the same. When talking about this issue, it is necessary to state first that for any problem, the solution must have a scientific or educational principle, and secondly, there must be a scientific or political or educational power. However, we have neither principles nor power in today's discussion, so we cannot solve it absolutely. The above problem is not only a problem for the entire society, but also a problem for the entire nation's future. If the entire nation's future is resolved, then the problem of secondary school students' employment will not be difficult to solve. As for seeking employment, first, we must find jobs and not necessarily rely on others; (2) We cannot have vanity when looking for a job; (3) Only hard work can achieve final success. The most important thing is that when you need to find a job and cannot find one, you must not be discouraged. Seek answers from the ways of effort, opportunity, and time.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Thought and Belief <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The third group is thought and belief.</p>
<p>The discussion question is how to train us to have correct core beliefs. Instructor Tong Xingbai gave his opinion, stating briefly that the issue of thought and belief is difficult to explain because the scope is too broad. In terms of time, there are advancing and retreating thoughts. In terms of nature, there are positive and negative thoughts. Moreover, thoughts are different, just like everyone's complex outlook on life. Therefore, thoughts must come from oneself in order to have core beliefs. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said it most clearly, that is, first have thought, then have belief, and then have power. Thought is the cause of belief, and belief is the result of thought. According to personal observation, the most suitable for China is the core belief of the Three Principles of the People. As for each person, please analyze and study your own thoughts before embarking on a path. Also, whether thinking about the past or the future, because the past is experience and the future is to achieve progress. The past is a reference tool, and the future is the goal of research. For core thoughts, you must grasp the present.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Love and Marriage <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The fourth group is love and marriage.</p>
<p>Instructor Zhang Yiping gave his opinion, stating briefly: (1) Love is not a game. Love is a legitimate thing. Secondary school students should not be in love, but they are not opposed to love. (2) Love should be responsible. In the past, freedom of love was unknown, which has misled many young people. (3) Marriage should also consider one's own family environment. Finally, Tao Baichuan explained and supplemented each point, and then</p>
<p>It ended.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Xu Zeyu Talks About <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The Education Situation in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>Xu Zeyu, Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, came to Shanghai the other day. The reporter met him at his residence in Shanghai and talked freely about the education situation in Zhejiang Province. According to him, Zhejiang's education has made great progress after several rounds of active reorganization by Jiang Menglin, Chen Bulei, Zhang Daofan, and Ye Suchong. With the existing funds, so much work is being done, and the allocation is also very appropriate. Since Director Xu took office, he has planned the administrative facilities in detail, and the content will be discussed in detail in the future. As for the current situation:</p>
<p>(1) Independent education funding. Three items are designated: foil business tax, tobacco and alcohol surtax, and slaughter business tax, totaling approximately 2 million yuan per year, as special education funds, which are allocated by the Department of Finance on a daily basis. This is different from the Jiangsu Province method. This matter is implemented in three phases. The first phase, foil business tax of 90,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.08 million yuan per year, was implemented in November of the 22nd year. The second phase, foil business tax of 100,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.2 million yuan per year, and tobacco and alcohol surtax of 200,000 yuan per year, totaling 1.4 million yuan, was implemented in July of the 23rd year. Currently, it is in the second phase, and the Department of Finance allocates 116,666 yuan of foil business tax and tobacco and alcohol surtax per month. The shortfall is found by the Department of Finance separately. From May of this year, it will be the third phase: foil tax of 100,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.2 million yuan per year, tobacco and alcohol surtax of 200,000 yuan, and slaughter business tax of 600,000 yuan, totaling 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Last year, the various counties suffered from famine, and tax revenue was greatly affected. Provincial schools were already in arrears of approximately 400,000 yuan. At the end of the year, Director Xu of the Department of Finance agreed to allocate 200,000 yuan first. The schools were about to close for the holidays, making it difficult to maintain them. As for education in various counties and cities, the total of 3.31 million yuan for 75 counties and 1 city was affected by the famine, and income is expected to decrease by more than 1.7 million yuan. Therefore, local education has fallen into a very difficult situation. Primary school teachers in various counties are owed salaries, with some being owed for as long as seven or eight months, and others for three or four months. Many primary schools have closed. It is hoped that Zhejiang merchants and all sectors of society overseas will work together to save the education of their homeland, which is on the verge of collapse. The Department of Education is currently requesting that 1 million yuan be allocated from local public bonds as an education reserve fund to help local education. This fund has not yet been received. It is also stipulated that various counties and cities should compile a tight budget for education funds and try to tighten expenditures.</p>
<p>(3) There are 13 provincial secondary schools, 20 county and city joint secondary schools, and 49 private secondary schools in the province. The number of students is 6,253 in provincial schools, 4,608 in county and city joint schools, and 9,699 in private schools, totaling 20,560. The funding for provincial secondary schools is more than 1 million yuan, for county and city joint schools is 220,000 plus yuan, and for private schools is more than 830,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) There are 5 provincial normal schools and 10 county joint normal schools. Various secondary schools also have attached normal departments, simple normal departments, rural normal departments, kindergarten normal departments, and infant protection normal departments, which are not included. There are 1,218 students in provincial normal schools, 849 in county joint schools, and 97 in private schools, totaling 2,164. The funding for provincial schools is more than 260,000 yuan, for county joint schools is more than 48,000 yuan, and for private schools is more than 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(5) There are 5 provincial vocational schools, 6 county joint vocational schools, and 12 private vocational schools. Various secondary schools also have attached business departments, civil engineering departments, and agricultural departments, which are not included. There are 919 students in provincial schools, 772 in county joint schools, and 1,051 in private schools, totaling 2,742. The funding for provincial schools is more than 190,000 yuan, for county joint schools is more than 47,000 yuan, and for private schools is more than 110,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(6) There are a total of 12,462 primary schools in the province, including 78 kindergartens, 11,046 primary schools, 1,245 elementary schools, and 93 short-term primary schools, with a total of 20,859 classes, a total of 706,201 students, and a total of 30,645 faculty and staff.</p>
<p>(7) The funding for social education undertakings in the province has increased year by year, and now totals 229,267 yuan, accounting for 1.02% of the total education funding. The funding for social education in counties and cities has also increased year by year, reaching 406,424 yuan in the 22nd year, accounting for 1.224% of the total education funding in counties and cities.</p>
<p>When Director Xu took office, the internal staff was not changed, and only four new employees were added, eliminating the bad habits of ordinary administrative agencies during the transition between new and old personnel. The previous handover funds, as reported in the news a few days ago, were more than 290,000 yuan in cash, which is inaccurate because they were all funds held in trust, such as airplane donation proceeds, which could not be used, or treasury bonds. In fact, the actual handover cash was only a few hundred yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Polish Cultural Special News <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Polish President Mościcki is a great inventor, as detailed in this newspaper. Recently, a magazine called "Je Suis Partout" in Greece discussed President Mościcki's invention "The Production of Artificial Air at High Altitude." Regarding this issue, Mościcki gave a lecture at the Presidential Palace to Polish science and medical experts. Also, the 1934 Moscow Literature Prize was awarded by the review committee to female writer Maria Rodziewiczówna. Rodziewiczówna is a famous novelist who specializes in writing about social issues and has significant artistic and national value. Also, novelist Boy-Żeleński gave a lecture in Italy, speaking on the Iberian Peninsula about the translator of the famous Spanish novel "Don Quixote." Boy-Żeleński recently went to various university cities in Spain and Portugal, such as Madrid, Toledo, Seville, Granada, Salamanca, Lisbon, and Porto, to give lectures, and at the same time introduced Polish literary works to various parts of South America. Also, Polish music received international honors. Violinist Zdzisław Jahnke went to the United States and is scheduled to hold twenty concerts in Philadelphia and other provinces within two months. Vocalist Ada Sari held a concert in Bucharest, Romania, which was greatly appreciated by the audience. The Polish opera "Halka" was recently performed by the New York Polish Opera Company at the Chicago Civic Opera House, with all the actors being Polish artists, and received artistic acclaim. Also, the Polish and German radio management offices recently signed a contract to promote closer ties in radio broadcasting between the two countries. The programs stipulated include Polish and German romantic and classical music, as well as modern popular music, with occasional broadcasts of entire operas. In order to enable flight personnel to know the actual situation, the radio station also broadcasts sports news and important news in detail, and this news is not only broadcast from the radio station, but also directly transmitted from sports venues, theaters, and concert halls. Since the radio sectors of Poland and Germany signed this agreement, it is thought that other countries will also follow suit, which will greatly benefit the promotion of international friendship.</p>

<h3 id="e227">A Retrospective on the Renaissance Week of Shanghai North High School by Tang Naikang <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>Time flies, and the year 1934 will soon become a historical date. As the New Year approaches, it is appropriate to review the past year and encourage future endeavors. Therefore, I will briefly describe the past situation of this year to seek correction from the enlightened individuals of this era.</p>
<p>(II) The Process of Renaissance</p>
<p>Since our school was destroyed in the January 28th Incident, colleagues have adhered to the principle that education is life and have vowed to revive it. We invited renowned figures from all walks of life to form a Renaissance Design Committee, which convened on March 5, 1933, at the club to discuss and plan the revival. A chairman and various officers were elected to implement the renaissance plan. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic support of the committee members and the dedicated efforts of our colleagues, after five months, the funds for rebuilding the school buildings were raised. Drawings were made and prices were estimated, and it was decided to start construction on the original site on October 21st. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 4th, attended by representatives from various party and government sectors who earnestly encouraged us to cultivate youth as preparation for the renaissance of the nation. In February 1934, the entire project was completed, including a classroom building, a dormitory building, and a Renaissance Hall, which can accommodate approximately 700 students. On April 8th, a dedication ceremony for the rebuilt school buildings was held, with a large number of guests attending. Mayor Wu of this city personally attended and instructed us to make spiritual education the standard for the efforts of all teachers and students. The perilous situation of the past two years of turbulence has finally entered a stable period.</p>
<p>(III) Overview of the Past Year</p>
<p>Since moving into the new school buildings, although the material facilities cannot fully meet expectations, they are still roughly complete. However, in education, the most important thing is the spirit. Here, I will divide it into four categories: academics, moral education, physical education, and student life, to observe the spiritual life of the past year.</p>
<p>A) Academics: Secondary school education must take into account both further education and employment. Our school strictly adheres to the standard curriculum set by the Ministry of Education and seeks truth from facts, so that students can use what they have learned to prepare for entering society and university. The following are some of the academic matters that can be mentioned in the past year:</p>
<p>(1) Adding Full-Time Teachers: The uneven level of students in recent years has become increasingly apparent from past grades. After careful consideration, the reason is half due to the students' lack of effort and half due to the teachers' inability to dedicate themselves fully. Therefore, this year, we have specially added full-time teachers for subjects such as English, mathematics, and science. This will not only allow teachers to concentrate their abilities but also give students more opportunities to approach them, melt away emotional barriers, and arouse students' interest in studying.</p>
<p>(2) Holding Subject Competitions: Subject competitions are held in stages. Those that have already been held include Chinese and mathematics, and those that will be held are English and science. Standards are set for grouping based on the level of proficiency. Prizes are awarded to the top students in each group to encourage them.</p>
<p>(3) Visiting Industrial Institutions: Senior students visit various industrial institutions to broaden their knowledge. Those who have visited include the Longhua Aircraft Factory, the Yabaoer Electric Bulb Company, the Kangyuan Canning Factory, the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, and so on. Students are also required to write visit reports to promote the practical application of knowledge.</p>
<p>(4) Checking In-Class and Extracurricular Performance: In addition to holding two quizzes each semester, we also check in-class and extracurricular performance, such as composition, mathematics, English exercise books, and notes for each subject, to verify whether students are attentively listening in class and whether they are guiding and practicing diligently outside of class.</p>
<p>(5) Increasing Graduation Class Exams: Graduation class students can complete a stage in their academic journey. After graduation, they either continue their studies or serve the community. Increasing the number of exams provides an opportunity to review and learn new things, and it also trains the agility of thought.</p>
<p>(6) Connecting with Student Families: The excellence of school education depends heavily on the guidance of family education. Our school emphasizes daily assignments to avoid fostering a mentality of侥倖 (seeking luck). If a student fails a quiz, the parents are notified in the hope of helping them supervise and increase teaching efficiency.</p>
<p>B) Moral Education: Our school has consistently emphasized strict moral education for the past eighteen years, without indulgence or oppression, guiding students to self-governance and putting their actions on the right track. The principles and methods are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Principles: A. Strictly adhere to the main purpose and implementation guidelines of education, to cultivate young people's national morality of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, and to cultivate courage, perseverance, and habits of discipline. B. Promote the spirit of the nation, guide the work of saving the country, encourage virtues such as love, public service, labor, and perseverance, and prevent bad habits such as selfishness, greed, romanticism, and decadence.

<h3 id="e228">Unexpected Harvest: Youyou Defeats Lux <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Four to Zero: Revenge for Previous Defeat</p>
<p>Two Goals in Each Half</p>
<p>In yesterday's Western Union First Division football match between Youyou and Lux, there were approximately over one thousand spectators in Shen Garden. The result was beyond the expectations of most people, with Youyou defeating Lux by a score of four to zero, avenging their 5-2 defeat in the first week. Not only were the members of the Youyou Association overjoyed, but the thousands of spectators were also dancing with joy. Lux, who had eliminated Western Police with a score of one to zero in the second week of the Scoccimarro Cup, suffered a shutout, demonstrating the unpredictability of military affairs.</p>

<p>Youyou won the kickoff and immediately took the offensive. Every player was fierce and eager to be first. After about six or seven minutes of back-and-forth play, Youyou made a stunning move, opening the opponent's net. Luo Haiguang passed the ball to Wang Nanzhen, who sprinted down the left wing and sent it to the center. Sun Jinshun happened to arrive at just the right moment and kicked the ball with great force. Kirkham tried to save it, but only managed to graze the ball.</p>

<p>Lux launched a counterattack. Hultbek had a beautiful diagonal shot that was saved by Zhang Rongcai. Liang Shutang mistakenly passed the ball back, but fortunately, no harm was done. Jiang Shan Jing, who was injured, rested for only a moment before returning to the field. Simmons fired a shot from the center, but Yun Fenglin touched the ball outside the free-kick line. Boseley took the free kick but missed. During these thirty minutes of Lux's counterattack, Lux's lack of coordination among the forwards ultimately led to nothing.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Wang Shusen Steals the Camp <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Shen Baigui made two surprise attacks, and Sun Jinshun also made a solo raid, but both failed to score. In the last five minutes of the first half, Youyou's players surrounded Lux's goal. Sun and Wang attacked repeatedly, but Kirkham saved them all. The ball went from left to right. Wang Shusen watched calmly and saw an opportunity to sneak through. He made a dash and advanced through the crowd, making the score two to zero at halftime.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Youyou Uses Heavy Artillery <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Lux kicked off in the second half. Youyou adopted a high-pressure tactic, attacking fiercely. Lux's defense was under constant bombardment, but they defended stubbornly for a long time. Sun Jinshun also made a solo penetration, but was blocked by Standiguerra. He then tried to send the ball over, but it was difficult to get in. Sweeping and charging, they still couldn't score, demonstrating the intensity of the offense and defense.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Goalkeeper Performs Well <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Youyou's performance was better than before, especially Zhang Rongcai, who is a noteworthy goalkeeper. He has a clear head and can remain calm in chaos, which is commendable. Simmons passed to Beck, who went to the center. Kirkham shot at the goal, but it went over the bar. Zhang Rongcai made several saves during this period, earning applause and cheers. Hultbek made a sneaky attempt, getting the ball from behind, and powerfully shot at the goal, but it was saved by Rongcai again. If Hultbek hadn't made so many mistakes, Lux might not have been shut out in the second half.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Another Two Goals in a Row <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Youyou pressed harder and harder, and scored two more goals in the last five minutes, bringing the score to a huge four to zero. Sun Jinshun got the ball from behind and made another sprint. Luo Haiguang supported him, and Lux's two defenders were distracted, allowing Sun to kick the ball in with his iron leg. In the last two minutes, General Sun came down from the sky again. Logan hurriedly chased after him, and Shen Baigui made a high shot. Logan blocked it with his hand, and Luo Haiguang kicked the penalty, gently curving the ball in. The game ended immediately after.</p>

<p>Pan Lai and Others Deny New York Rumors</p>
<p>But Aublin Still Insists It's True</p>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 5th) Although tennis players Pan Lai and others have denied the New York rumors, Aublin, the manager of the Tilden Professional Tennis Company, still insists that it is true, saying that the world's number one player Pan Lai and two female players, Jacobs and Mrs. Harding, will join his professional group. A Reuters reporter visited Aublin today. According to the conversation, Aublin still maintains his previous statement and said that Jacobs' initial reward was $15,000, which was increased to $20,000 before she accepted. Mrs. Harding has accepted a reward of $10,000. Now someone has visited Mrs. Harding to request confirmation of this news. Mrs. Harding said that the amount of the reward is true, but she has not accepted it. As for the rumor that Pan Lai will come to San Francisco on February 23rd to sign a contract, Pan Lai in Australia has absolutely denied it.</p>

<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education School basketball team has been competing with county women's middle schools and Jiangnan women's middle schools in Wuxi for several days and has won all games. At 4 PM on the 3rd, they played an exhibition match with the Wuxi Championship Team, the Jingzhi Women's Middle School basketball team. As Jingzhi Women's Middle School was holding its 30th anniversary celebration, many guests were present, making the audience even more crowded, reaching more than 4,000 people, which was the largest turnout ever for a basketball game in Wuxi. Qin Xingshi, the leader of the Southeast team, is an alumnus of Jingzhi, and the physical education teacher of Jingzhi is also a graduate of Southeast. They are all "one of us", so it was just a slight performance to express congratulations. Without much intense competition, Southeast won by a score of 52 to 5. On the afternoon of the 5th, they also played a match against the male teachers' team of Wuxi Middle School. Tickets were sold for five cents, which was used for disaster relief. The audience was also extremely crowded. It is said that Jingzhi Women's Middle School will continue to hold sports events, and the Southeast players plan to stay in Wuxi for one or two more days to help. They are scheduled to go to Zhenjiang on the 6th.</p>

<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Hearing Words, She Hides Tears and Sells Herself into Misery; Carefully Peering at Invitation Cards, He Earnestly Seeks Refuge</p>
<p>Cheng Zhiqian quickly stood up and introduced to Li Shilian, "This is Mr. Wang Beihai. He is a high school student here. He aspires to go to Beiping in the future to take the university entrance exam, so he is tutoring algebra and geometry with me. He is really diligent. He never misses any of the practice problems he learns every day, and he sends them to me every day to be corrected. Although I am very busy, I always take some time out to help such a diligent young man, so he comes to me every day. But he doesn't like to talk much, so even when he comes, no one knows." Because Cheng Zhiqian introduced him so solemnly, Li Shilian was too embarrassed not to say a few polite words, so he smiled and said, "So diligent, really rare!" As he spoke, he couldn't help but turn his gaze to Yueying and smiled, "You're here too." Yueying lowered her head, raised her eyelids, and looked at Li Shilian. As Li Shilian's gaze met hers, he chuckled. Cheng Zhiqian was very unhappy to see this, and he frowned and looked at Li Shilian, smilingly saying, "Don't make things difficult for her. Sigh! They are all pitiful creatures." Although he said this with a smile, there seemed to be a very serious attitude hidden within his smile. After all, Li Shilian didn't want to offend him over this small matter. The chairman even invites him to dinner, and the director even lends him his car to travel. So, he sat down on a square stool diagonally opposite Yueying and said with a smile, "How dare I make things difficult for this girl? I heard the tea attendant say that her happy news had moved, and when I saw her, I was reminded of this matter, so I naturally couldn't help but smile." As he spoke, he glanced at Yueying again. He was sitting with his head lowered, his feet together, and his hands supporting his knees. It was as if sitting there, the movement of his hands and feet was free. Cheng Zhiqian offered Li Shilian a cigarette, and he also smoked one to accompany him. (105)</p>
<h3 id="e245">Nanjing Governor <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Shi</p>
<p>Our hometown, Yixing, has a local saying: "Nanjing Governor." The meaning of the name is very funny and a bit humorous. Every time the season reaches the cold winter, this local saying can often be heard, especially in small restaurants, where you can see people shouting "Nanjing Governor" at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>Leaving my hometown and studying in Shanghai, I can also hear this local saying in small restaurants. Now that it is winter again, the "Nanjing Governor" is also on the market.</p>
<p>As for the meaning of the name, let me introduce it first. Because winter is a cold season, many dishes at mealtime are never eaten piping hot. Therefore, many leftover dishes are put together and cooked, adding some fresh ingredients. This is called "Governor" (the character "督" (du) is a colloquial term, meaning "to cook"). And "Governor" also means the central government, so it is called "Nanjing Governor."</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the "Governor" has a special flavor, both hot and delicious, and economical. It is even better than an order of combined dishes costing several yuan. Generally, people like to eat "Governor," and that is the reason.</p>
<p>If you are interested, prepare a few taels of white spirits and a packet of peanuts, and eat them slowly together. There is a truly indescribable flavor. Using it to pass the long nights of this harsh winter, reading the books you like, imagining the fun at this time, is like floating away to become an immortal. Ladies and gentlemen with leisure! You might as well try the taste of "Nanjing Governor," and it will certainly not disappoint you.</p>

<p>— (Jiaoxin)</p>
<p>If a woman marries a handsome man, she will definitely have "one extra layer" of anxiety, because while it is certainly gratifying to be married to a handsome man, on the one hand, she is also afraid that her husband will fall in love with someone else and lose her love. Conversely, if a woman marries an ugly husband, although she may be unhappy in her heart, she can rest assured and not have to be on guard. From this, it can be seen that there is no absolute perfection or absolute deficiency in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e247">"Taking Up for the Underdog" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Among the people coming and going on the road, there are always two absolutely contradictory mentalities: one is "everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, and does not care about the frost on other people's roofs"; the other is "when seeing injustice on the road, drawing one's knife to help." The former is called "mature and prudent," and can also be called "selfish and self-interested." As for the latter, they are mostly hot-blooded, and after being influenced by the eleventh son in the drama and the golden Arhat in the novel, they become enthusiastic people who "join in even if it is none of their business." However, compared to these two types of people, the latter always suffers, and that is what is meant by "troubles all arise from sticking one's neck out." But society cannot do without this kind of person. Now, let me give two examples!</p>
<p>A streetcar was crowded with people, and the ticket seller was too busy to sell tickets. There was a mischievous child hiding in the crowd, holding a copper coin in his hand, refusing to buy a ticket. After the streetcar crossed the Waibaidu Bridge, there were fewer passengers, and a ticket inspector suddenly jumped on. He found the child and insisted that the ticket seller had been skimming. The ticket seller could not explain, and his tickets were torn up, so he had to admit his bad luck. Unexpectedly, a Cheng Yaojin jumped out, and a passenger shouted injustice for the ticket seller, saying, "We are all Chinese, let's help each other." Unexpectedly, the ticket inspector darkened his face and said, "I am Korean, I don't help Chinese people." The passenger scolded him for being a slave of a conquered country, and they ended up fighting. When the streetcar arrived at the station, this passenger who had nothing to do with it ended up going to the police station with the ticket inspector.</p>
<p>Next to the early morning vegetable market, there are many vendors carrying loads on their shoulders and in their hands. These vendors are prohibited by the police station's regulations, so as soon as they see the shadow of the police, they quickly hide into the alleys without a trace. One day, a child selling scallions and garlic was simple-minded and was caught by the police. He赖 (lai: refuse to leave) on the ground and refused to go, crying in his mouth. Suddenly, many people gathered to watch. One onlooker couldn't bear it any longer and said to the police, "He's so pitiful, let him go!" The police shook his head and said! "It's official business!" Seeing that he didn't agree, the onlooker added, "Catching robbers is meritorious, catching a few vendors won't get you promoted to chief!" Seeing that his words were sarcastic, the police let go of the vendor and dragged the onlooker who had taken up for the underdog to the jail.</p>

<p>— Original work by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Today, we are going to the hunting grounds, which can be said to be a most suitable and interesting day!" She said solemnly as usual, "We will take this opportunity to hold a memorial ceremony for our ancestors. Because on this very day, one of our ancestors, who was then only a tribal leader and not yet an emperor, but tribal conflicts were very common. This time, another conflict broke out. In the battle, our side was in a very unfavorable situation, and even our food supply was cut off. On this day, we had to divide the remaining cold rice among everyone as much as possible. But it was really too little to satisfy their hunger. Helplessly, they had to gather a lot of wild raw vegetables, mix them with the cold rice, and swallow them reluctantly to fill their stomachs. This is a general overview of the situation. If you want to know the details, wait until we get to the hunting grounds to talk about it! Because the place where this story happened is also a forest, a forest as dense and deep as the forest in the hunting grounds!"</p>
<p>At this time, still standing in front of her and listening attentively were the group of close officials who accompanied her all day long, including Guangxu, Empress Longyu, Consort Jin, and our eight female officials. There was an obviously proud gleam in her eyes, flickering. Part of the reason may have been because she associated herself with being a Manchu leader, so she became very excited when she mentioned the bravery and perseverance of the former leaders. The other half of the reason may have been because she thought there would be a new ceremony today, which she would lead us to hold, and therefore she felt very happy. If this guess is correct, I cannot help but feel a sense of surprise at the Empress Dowager. (215)</p>
<h3 id="e250">The Tomb of Gui Youguang <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Tie Shui</p>
<p>Ever since reading "A Brief Account of My Late Mother," I can never forget the genuine affection revealed in the text, and the name of its author, Gui Youguang, is also deeply imprinted in my memory.</p>
<p>This time, I happened to be hiking in Kunshan, and with a different kind of feeling, I went to pay homage to his final resting place. The tomb is located in the northeast of Kunshan, less than half a kilometer from the bustling city, surrounded by low walls, with an area of about five or six acres, and the tomb is in the center. The size of the tomb is no different from ordinary ones, but because it has been rebuilt with cement, it looks very majestic. In front of the tomb stands a stone tablet erected in the twenty-fourth year of Qianlong, which reads "The Tomb of Mr. Gui Zhenchuan, Vice Minister of the Nanjing Court of Imperial Sacrifices of the Ming Dynasty." In addition to this, there are three newly built small pavilions in the tomb. In the small pavilion inscribed with the words "Looking Up To," two stone tablets are embedded in the wall, with inscriptions that are not very clear, probably epitaphs or something of that nature.</p>
<p>Gui Youguang was a native of Kunshan in the Ming Dynasty. Zhenchuan was the alias people used to call him. He was born intelligent and could write articles at the age of nine, but because he repeatedly failed the imperial examinations, he did not pass the examination until he was fifty-eight years old. He became the magistrate of Changxing County. In the year before his death, at the age of sixty-five, he was recommended by Grand Secretary Gao Gong and Zhao Zhenji to be the Vice Minister of the Nanjing Court of Imperial Sacrifices to revise the Veritable Records of Emperor Shizong, which was the most glorious period of his life.</p>
<p>The characteristic of his articles is that he uses true feelings to describe everyday trivial matters. His "Record of the Thinking-of-Son Pavilion," "Record of the Xiangji Pavilion," and other essays, like "A Brief Account of My Late Mother," can move every reader and make you unable to forget them. And his faithful descriptions and unpretentious language have a very modern flavor.</p>
<p>In Kunshan, this tomb, along with Gu Tinglin's handwritten copy of "Book on the Advantages and Disadvantages of the Provinces and Kingdoms," are known as two ancient sites that are enough to glorify Kunshan.</p>
<p>Travel Notes</p>
<h3 id="e251">On the Indian Ocean (Part 1) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>October 29th, departed from London for Scotland. November 1st, in Glasgow, boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's new ship "Hai Zhen" and set sail. The climate in Scotland was severely cold. Looking at the snow-covered mountains from the harbor, although the cabins were equipped with hot water radiators, I still felt the chill. But after crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the weather changed suddenly, and the heat in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean increased sharply, as if it were high summer. The electric fan in the bedroom rotated day and night, but the nights were hot and difficult to fall asleep. During the day, there was nothing to do, so I lay on the deck with disheveled hair and bare feet, wearing a single shirt and white trousers, basking in the sun and watching the sea, which was quite carefree.</p>
<p>There were only four passengers on the ship, including me. The other three travel companions were all doctors who had completed their studies in Belgium and were returning home in glory. We each occupied third-class cabins, and our lives were quite comfortable. The ship's cook was from Guangdong, and we ate Western food three times a day, which was quite tiresome. Sometimes the doctors cooked Chinese food themselves, which was quite delicious. The navigator (commonly known as the second mate) was Mr. Xue Bangxiang from Wuxi, a graduate of the Liverpool Nautical School. We spent our time chatting in the morning and evening, so the long fifty-day sea voyage did not feel lonely.</p>
<p>The "Hai Zhen" was newly completed in a British shipyard. The voyage of this maiden voyage was estimated to take forty-five days to reach Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to pass through the Suez Canal on November 14th, but in order to save coal, the ship's speed was reduced from fifteen miles per hour to about seven or eight miles. It was not until 3:00 a.m. on the 15th that it docked at Port Said on the north bank of the Suez Canal. Port Said is one of Egypt's important commercial ports, located in the middle of the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and is the only passage from Asia to Europe. It has a population of over 194,000, mostly Arabs and Egyptians. The locals of Port Said have a very bad reputation, mostly thieves, but this is not necessarily the case. It is just that good people are harmed by bad people.</p>
<p>The day before the ship arrived at the port, the entire ship became vigilant and declared martial law. All doors, large and small, were locked, and even the fire hoses, which were originally hung on the walls, were taken down and stored in the storage room. According to the sailors, the locals of Port Said are good swimmers and can climb onto the deck when people are unprepared to steal things. Whether it's cups, knives, forks, matches, or handkerchiefs, they will take whatever they can get their hands on, so we must take precautions in advance.</p>
<p>At 6:00 a.m., Egyptian peddlers climbed onto the deck to sell goods. One of them, who was fluent in Cantonese, asked Dr. V, who was traveling with us, "Do you want erotic pictures?" The asking price was two shillings. Dr. V agreed to the price, but after checking, the goods were not the original ones, only a few photos of models. It turned out that they had already "switched the baby."</p>
<p>At about 7:00 a.m., the east was already white, and the sun rose. Some locals boarded the ship and urged us to go ashore for sightseeing. At that time, the Egyptian and Arab coal handlers hired by the captain, twenty people in a small boat, came one after another, climbing the four boards, with ferocious faces, which made people feel scared. I was not used to the coal dust and the noise, so I asked the locals to find me a ferry. But the sailors advised against it, fearing accidents. They also warned that the locals were cunning and rogue, and even if a guest had no money on him, there was a risk of being "skinned alive." So we went ashore at about 9:00 a.m., paying one shilling each for the round trip, and hired an old guide to be our interpreter and companion during the tour.</p>
<p>The old guide was very honest, attentive, and sincere, which is rare to find among the locals of Port Said. Before we left, we jointly signed a letter of introduction to be used as a reliable guide for our compatriots who visit Port Said in the future.</p>

<p>— Xie Bingshi</p>
<p>Apart from a few special municipalities, Zhenjiang can be considered important in the country. Because Jiangsu Province is wealthy in the country. Since the provincial government moved to Zhenjiang, Zhenjiang has become the capital of Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>The term "provincial capital" has been used for several years, and it is naturally more important for medicine and health. The current Chairman Chen is doing his best to promote hygiene, so everything has developed considerably. Although it is not as developed as Shanghai and Nanjing, it is much better than before.</p>
<p>Currently, the largest medical institution in Zhenjiang is the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital. Before the establishment of the provincial hospital, the Hygiene Section of the Public Security Bureau set up a free clinic. There were no public general hospitals or health institutions. The private ones are about the same as those in other places, with the same complete equipment. The oldest one is the Hongren Hospital, which has an affiliated nursing school, and the Rural Nursing School run by Zhenjiang County. Next is the Christian Hospital and the Women and Children's Hospital, which were closed due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Before the establishment of public and private medical institutions, only informal doctors opened clinics. At that time, the public did not know what medicine was. They always thought that the medical institutions were good and received a lot of support.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Provincial Hospital, the provincial capital has benefited a lot. Each county directly under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu Province has also established county hospitals. These county hospitals are under the control of the Provincial Hospital. The location of the Provincial Hospital is not suitable, so branch clinics and free maternity hospitals were established in the city. At that time, the maternal mortality rate was very high, and there were no trained midwives. Due to the urgent need for such talents, several classes of midwives were recruited and taught about disinfection methods and simple delivery methods. The authorities felt that these trained midwives were still not fully effective. Therefore, they began to establish the Jiangsu Provincial Midwifery School. Each county sent two students per class. After graduation, they were assigned to work in various counties.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang's disease prevention institutions only started this year. A health office was established, specializing in prevention work and some treatment, school hygiene, store hygiene, and inspection of slaughterhouses. Licenses were given before they could operate. There is also a chemical laboratory to help with inspections.</p>
<p>The Provincial Medical and Political College opened in October. Chairman Chen serves as the president concurrently. There are four departments inside: the Department of Health Administration, the Department of Medicine (that is, the medical department), the Department of Health Education, and the Department of Medical Research (that is, traditional Chinese medicine receiving further training in scientific principles). These personnel are the basic health team of Jiangsu Province in the future.</p>
<p>There is no organization in the provincial capital that promotes disease prevention and treatment in writing. Later, the Hongren Hospital sponsored the "Public Medicine and Health" weekly, which was attached to the newspaper. A total of twenty-five issues were published. At that time, Zhenjiang newspapers focused on literature and expanded the literature section, so the "Public Medicine and Health" weekly was discontinued. In short, the Zhenjiang press has not yet recognized the importance of health and cannot fulfill its duties. Now, there are no more such publications in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang's waterworks has a relatively long history. The water source for water intake seems to be too close to the riverbank, and it is often contaminated by unclean objects. The water storage tank is sixteen feet deep and has a very small area. Alum is used to help it settle. There are ten filter beds, using rapid sand filtration. As a result, the water is very clear, but who knows how many bacteria this clear water contains! There is no disinfection method or chemical laboratory in their factory to test the water, which is the most terrible thing. Water is what people drink every day and has a close relationship with the human body. So, we should pay attention to this invisible killing machine.</p>
<p>I have said a lot, but it is not systematic. Let's end here for now! The future health of Zhenjiang will develop, and I will contribute more to readers later.</p>

<p>Introduction | Medical Education | Medical Group Activities | Medical Disputes | Medical Publishing | Medical Research | Medical Construction | Military Medical Training | A Glimpse of the Old Medical World | Trends in the New Pharmaceutical Industry | Survey of Rural Hygiene | Views on Urban Hygiene | Conclusion</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>The endless waves of time flow, never stopping, surging forward, and a year's time passes like a white horse flashing past a crack. We who talk about medicine must deeply reflect on the changes in Chinese medicine and health in the past year on the long historical stage, and make a whole and comprehensive description.</p>
<p>Chinese medicine and health in our country has a history of a hundred years since the introduction of Western scientific medicine. However, its hesitation and the stagnation of old medicine are both weaknesses of Chinese medicine and health in the past, which cannot compete with other countries in the world. Face reality and look forward to the future. We must also list and compare in detail the extent of progress in Chinese medicine and health in the past year as a way to improve.</p>
<p>This article is written from a historical perspective and describes the main points; it also evaluates its gains and losses with an objective eye. So that we can understand its outline, know its general trend, and consider how we should promote the advancement of Chinese medicine in the future? How to eliminate medical disputes in China? How to build a health cause in China? How to awaken the illusions of old medicine? How can Chinese medicine shine in the world? Although, this is not something that my humble pen can describe in its entirety. I only seek to offer a small contribution as a way to attract greater contributions, and I hope to gain the corrections and efforts of contemporary sages.</p>
<p>(2) Medical Education</p>
<p>What is the state of medical education in our country? Recently, Mr. Wang Qizhang of this publication has made a detailed evaluation, like a bright light in a dark room, illuminating everything! To sum up in one sentence, medical education in our country in the past was all passive and alienated education, and there are signs of a trend towards danger and death! In the twenty-third year, although the Ministry of Education established a Medical Education Committee and formulated an outline of curriculum standards, the tendency of medical education to become alienated has not decreased as a result. According to the survey, there are currently thirty-one medical schools in our country, and their nature can be roughly divided into five categories:</p>
<p>National 　　　　　　　　　　 Four</p>
<p>Provincial 　　　　　　　　　　 Six</p>
<p>Private 　　　　　　　　　　 Eight</p>
<p>Church and Foreign Established 　　　　　 Eleven</p>
<p>Military Medical 　　　　　　　　　　 Two</p>
<p>Observing the above table, we know that the number of medical schools established by churches and foreigners accounts for one-third of the total number of medical schools in the country. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has stipulated the graduation year limit of medical schools, setting the graduation year for medical colleges at six years and the graduation year for medical specialty schools at four years. However, the current academic programs of medical schools vary, with some graduating in seven years, six years, five years, and four years. If this cannot be unified, and there is so much foreign education, how can the alienation of medical education be actively corrected and achieve the goal of automatic and autonomous medical education in our country?</p>
<p>In mid-October of the twenty-third year, we vaguely heard that the draft of the medical curriculum standards prepared by the Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education had been officially completed, and opinions were solicited from medical experts in major cities such as Peiping, Shanghai, and Hankou. This shows that the members of the Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education have an open mind and see the seriousness of this matter. However, we must say a word:</p>
<p>We already know that medical education in our country is increasingly alienated! How to reverse this tide? It depends on what the medical curriculum standards will be in the future, and then we can make a decision. I am ashamed that I have not been able to see the full text of the medical curriculum standards set by the Ministry of Education this time, so I dare not express my opinion rashly. According to rumors, it seems that in the curriculum standards, foreign languages will be graded for medical texts, with Chinese as the top, German and French as the bottom, and Japanese even lower. If this is true, the result of the future medical education tending to alienation will be even worse than today? The language of a country is just a man-made symbol; in short, it is a symbol. If we want to absorb foreign knowledge, it is certainly a shortcut to learn foreign languages, but we cannot force ourselves to learn a certain country's language as good. Today's scholars need to be familiar with the languages of all countries, and then they can hope to take the advantages of each country, integrate them, and make them the advantages of our country. Otherwise, if we focus on the pursuit of a certain country's language, we will inevitably forget our ancestors, force the advantages of a certain country's knowledge, and despise what our country does not have; force the convenience of a certain country's language, and ridicule our country's language as useless. If we continue to do this, will the future scientific medicine in China not be particularly Westernized? Can we still ask about the alienation of medical education in our country in the future? We have witnessed the danger of this tendency. It is certainly impossible to disregard English, and it is not necessary to focus on German and French. Different people have different views, so the medical language cannot be forcibly stipulated.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that our country lacks doctors. In the twenty-third year, the number of graduates from various medical schools and the population ratio of our country is about one in 250,000, which is still weak, and there is a great sigh of talent shortage! I will list the accurate number of graduates from medical schools that I have investigated to see a glimpse.</p>
<p>Shanghai Medical College 　　　 Thirteen people</p>
<p>Medical College of Peking University 　 Forty people</p>
<p>Hebei Provincial Medical College 　　 Fourteen people</p>
<p>Peking Union Medical College 　 Twenty-five people</p>
<p>Guangzhou Xia Ge Medical College 　 Fourteen people</p>
<p>Shanghai St. John's Medical School Seventeen people</p>
<p>Shanghai Aurora University Medical College 　 Eight people</p>
<p>Jinan Qilu Medical College 　 Fourteen people</p>
<p>Shanghai Southeast Medical College 　 One hundred and fifteen people</p>
<p>"Note" Those that have not been accurately investigated are not included.</p>
<p>Observing from the above table, I deeply feel that the academic system of medical education in our country is</p>
<p>is not uniform. The smallest number of graduates from the medical schools listed above is only eight, and the largest number exceeds one hundred. Only the number of graduates from Peking University Medical College is relatively close to the 50 students per class stipulated by the Ministry of Education, and the rest are quite different. We feel that today, our country lacks medical talents, so the increase in the number of medical school graduates each year should, at a minimum, follow the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Education. Otherwise, it will be so difficult to cultivate medical talents, and the hope of popularizing scientific medicine in China will never come.</p>
<p>The medical terms in our country are numerous, dazzling, and not unified. In the spring of the twenty-third year, the Ministry of Education had the organization of a Medical Terminology Review Committee, hiring Mr. Song Wusheng, Zhu Hengbi, Tao Chichun, Song Guobin and other gentlemen as members, which is worth recording.</p>

<h3 id="e256">Common Sense of Hygiene for Ears, Nose, Throat, and Eyes (Reading) <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(30) Eye Hygiene</p>
<p>Although the eyes are small, once they get sick, the danger is often great. Just look at the pain of blind people to get a general idea. Therefore, we should not neglect the health of our eyes in normal times. Here, I will briefly list ten points of its hygiene. If you can practice them, it may not be without benefit.</p>
<p>(1) Getting up early and going to bed early is a general principle of hygiene, and it is also the key to nourishing the eyes. We know that people who often suffer from conjunctivitis (red eye) do not usually get up early and go to bed early.</p>
<p>(2) Do not use towels in public places to avoid the spread of trachoma.</p>
<p>(3) Strong light and flashing light are enough to damage the eyes and must be avoided. Therefore, when walking in the hot sun in summer or the white snow in winter, it is best to wear dark or yellow protective glasses to avoid the stimulation of strong light.</p>
<p>(4) It is not advisable to read books while riding in a car, because the fonts shake and damage eyesight.</p>
<p>(5) If dust, sand, or coal ash gets into the eyes, do not rub the eyelids immediately. You should close your eyes for a while and wait for the foreign objects to flow out of the eyes with tears. Because tears can make the dust, sand, and coal ash attached to the eyes lubricate and flow out. That is, tears have the natural function of removing foreign objects from the eyes.</p>
<p>(6) The distance between the eyeball and the object being viewed should be 30 centimeters. The time spent reading and writing should not be too long. You should close your eyes often to rest and adjust the eye muscles, and do not let them work excessively.</p>
<p>(7) It is not advisable to read or write in places with insufficient light, direct sunlight, etc., or at dusk.</p>
<p>(8) The light for reading and writing must come from the front left above. Backlighting should not be used. The distance between the light and the object being viewed should not be too far or too close. About one and a half feet is the most appropriate. The light power should be 50 candle power. The lampshade should be green. The bulb should be frosted.</p>
<p>(9) Bowel movements must be smooth every day to avoid congestion in the eyes.</p>
<p>(10) Nearsighted eyes should wear appropriate corrective glasses. They should not be configured casually. They must be examined by an ophthalmologist and then configured by an optician to be appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e257">A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>(5) Specialized Diagnosis | | Tuberculin Reaction</p>
<p>What are the methods of using tuberculin in diagnosis? It is divided into two types: eye reaction and skin reaction. On the skin reaction side, there are four different methods: skin scratch, skin application, intradermal, and subcutaneous. Adding the eye reaction, they are commonly known as the five tuberculin reactions. These five methods cover almost all applications in diagnosis. Regarding their detailed circumstances, I will now describe them one by one below...</p>
<p>(A) Eye Reaction: Use one drop of a 1% tuberculin solution and drop it into the conjunctiva of the eye. Usually, within eight to twenty-four hours, most tuberculosis patients will develop conjunctivitis in that eye. However, if the reaction is negative, one drop of a 4% solution can be dropped into the other eye to observe the final result. This diagnostic method is most suitable for suspected cases of tuberculosis with fever. However, it should be avoided in children who have had eye diseases, are currently suffering from eye diseases, or have glandular diseases.</p>
<p>(B) Skin Reaction: This is also known as the Pirquet test; the procedure is similar to the usual vaccination method. First, clean the skin of the upper arm or forearm with alcohol, then take one or two drops of tuberculin solution (a 25% solution mixed with 0.5% carbolic acid) and drop it onto the skin. Then, use a small knife to break the skin in that area; in addition, it is best not to create a wound at a considerable distance, so that the two sides can be compared accurately. If this reaction is positive, an inflammatory swelling will occur at the inoculation site; this situation is definitely not present in the other small skin wound. The reaction usually occurs between twenty-four and forty-eight hours; some occur rapidly within five or six hours, and some are delayed until three or four days later. Increased temperature is rarely seen. | | This method is the most widely used because there are no contraindications under any circumstances; and the value of its positive reaction is more accurate and reliable than that of the eye reaction.</p>
<p>(C) Cutaneous Reaction: Also known as the Moro ointment reaction. A pea-sized piece of ointment made of tuberculin and anhydrous lanolin is applied to the skin (preferably on the chest below the left clavicle) for about one or two minutes. The area of application should not be too large, about the size of a silver dollar. Usually, after twenty-four or forty-eight hours, reddish nodules will appear on the skin of the applied area, varying from a few to dozens; this is a manifestation of a positive reaction! This method has the same value as the skin reaction in tuberculosis diagnosis.</p>
<p>(D) Intradermal Reaction: What is called an intradermal reaction? It is the injection of tuberculin solution into the skin. At this time, a raised blister will usually appear on the skin surface, but it will gradually disappear. The initial concentration of the solution is about 1:5000, but it can later be increased to a concentration of 1:100 or 1:10. After twelve or twenty-four hours, if a positive reaction is found, a state of redness, swelling, and infiltration will occur at the injection site, and it will be painful. This situation is most severe at about forty-eight hours; the upper arm is the most obvious part, followed by the legs and abdomen. Systemic reactions, such as increased body temperature, are also extremely rare; therefore, there are no contraindications under any circumstances, and it is similar to the skin reaction. As for its diagnostic value, it is also very accurate; sometimes, when other methods have no results, this test is relied upon to determine the final outcome.</p>
<p>(E) Subcutaneous Injection Reaction: What is called a subcutaneous reaction? It is the injection of tuberculin solution using the usual subcutaneous injection procedure. This positive reaction mostly causes systemic symptoms, so this procedure must be performed with great care, and it is best to wait until all possible tests have not provided a satisfactory answer. When the patient receives the injection, the daily temperature and other symptoms must be clearly examined for three days in advance. If the usual temperature exceeds 37 degrees Celsius, it should not be injected. In addition, this test should be avoided if the patient has heart disease, kidney disease, or has recently coughed up blood. The concentration of the solution is usually a 1:1000 dilution. The initial dose only needs one-thousandth of the total diluted solution. If no positive reaction occurs, it can be gradually increased in increments, but it can only be increased up to ten times at most. Even if there is no positive reaction, it should be stopped at this point. After the patient is injected, they must rest in bed and not move, and the body temperature should be checked every two hours. The reaction is detected as early as seven or eight hours and as late as eleven or twelve hours. In addition to the local reaction, it also has both systemic and lesion symptoms, which the above four do not have.</p>
<h3 id="e258">An Overview of Malaria (3) <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolan</p>
<p>Prognosis of Malaria</p>
<p>Tertian and quartan malaria rarely cause death. Only patients who are chronically ill, emaciated, or elderly and weak may develop heart and lung diseases, which are dangerous for the prognosis. The repeated attacks, gradual development into chronic malaria or malarial cachexia, are also the same. If a person with a strong physique contracts it, the reproduction of malaria parasites is often not vigorous, the attacks stop, and it seems to heal naturally. However, the asexual and sexual bodies of the parasites are still dormant in the body. When physical strength is weakened or other inducing factors occur, they take the opportunity to relapse. In winter, when the weather is cold, malaria is not transmitted, but it still occurs, which is actually due to this. According to Shigakiyo, there are cases of quartan malaria recurring after five to fifteen years. With proper treatment, malignant malaria is also easy to cure, but those who develop malarial cachexia or atypical symptoms often die. According to historical statistics, the mortality rate of blackwater fever is about 5% to 16%.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of Malaria</p>
<p>The characteristics of malaria are typical cold and fever attacks, splenomegaly, anemia, malaria parasites in the blood, and an increase in large mononuclear white blood cells. If blood is not examined and only other symptoms are used as diagnostic criteria, it is easy to confuse tertian and quartan malaria during the initial attack, or when the fever type of malignant malaria is irregular, or when several types of malaria parasites are mixedly infected, with typhoid fever, sepsis, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis, relapsing fever, influenza, acute endocarditis, and liver syphilis. Chronic malaria is similar to cystitis, pyelonephritis, tonsillitis, sinusitis, tooth inflammation, latent abscesses, and intestinal parasitic diseases. Malarial cachexia is similar to leukemia and liver cirrhosis. Atypical malignant malaria is often misdiagnosed as cholera, meningitis, stroke, uremia, and acute poisoning. Without careful differentiation, it cannot be determined.</p>
<p>There are two methods for examining blood. One is to take the patient's blood, prepare a specimen, and examine it under a microscope. If only motile pigment granules and small pieces of protoplasm are found in the red blood cells, it is called the unstained examination method. The other is to prepare a blood specimen, fix it with absolute alcohol, and stain it with Romanowsky's method (i.e., one part of 1% methylene blue aqueous solution and five parts of 0.1% eosin aqueous solution, mixed and stained for 20 minutes), or Giemsa's method (i.e., five drops of Giemsa's solution and five milliliters of distilled water, mixed and stained for 15 minutes), or Wood's method (i.e., staining twice with 0.1% eosin solution and 0.25% Azur II solution). In the stained examination method, the red blood cells are pale red, and the malaria parasites are blue.</p>
<p>If there are few malaria parasites in the blood and they are not easy to detect, Ross's staining method can be used. A thick drop of blood is smeared on a slide and allowed to dry. It is then immersed in an equal mixture of 2% formaldehyde and 1% acetic acid for about 3 minutes to dissolve the hemoglobin. It is washed with water, dried, and then stained with Giemsa's method. If malaria parasites are latent in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, muscles, and other organs that store blood, the malaria parasite provocation method must be used. Cold water can be poured on the spleen area, or it can be irradiated with sunlight and artificial sun lamps, or adrenaline, boiled milk, or peptone can be injected into the muscles, or Arsacetin can be injected subcutaneously to change blood circulation or cause organ contraction, driving the malaria parasites into the blood. The examination is performed again after several hours.</p>
<p>Treatment of Malaria</p>
<p>(1) Special Treatment: In ancient times, cinchona bark was used to treat malaria. When Pelletier et al. isolated its important component, quinine (Chinin), which can kill malaria parasites in free blood, it gained a reputation for its remarkable efficacy. However, it is not effective against parasites residing in internal organs and the crescent-shaped sexual forms of malignant malaria. People with different constitutions or pregnant women may experience side effects such as dizziness, vomiting, tinnitus, and stomach upset, as well as the risk of inducing blackwater fever and abortion, which are its weaknesses. Since Schulemann et al. developed plasmoquine, which can kill the sexual forms of malignant malaria and supplement what quinine cannot, the combination of cinchona bark and plasmoquine is especially effective in treating malaria. Recently, Mietzsch et al. developed atabrine, which has the same function as quinine but without side effects. People with special constitutions or pregnant women can use it without worry, making the treatment of malaria more complete.</p>
<p>The daily dosage of quinine hydrochloride or quinine sulfate is 0.9 to 1.2 grams. For tertian and quartan malaria, it is advisable to take one gram five hours before the attack, or divide it into five doses of 0.2 grams every two hours, all of which must be taken for three consecutive days. Then, take 0.5 grams per day for three consecutive weeks to achieve a radical cure. Alternatively, atabrine can be taken three times a day, 0.1 grams each time, for seven consecutive days. For malignant malaria, after taking atabrine according to the previous method, take plasmoquine 0.03 to 0.04 grams per day for three consecutive days, or take QuinoPlasmoquine alone three times a day, one tablet each time, for three consecutive weeks, which is very effective. For severe cases, quinine or QuinoPlasmoquine can be injected intramuscularly. The above dosages should be reduced appropriately for the elderly and children.</p>
<p>Quinine hydrochloride (Chininum hydrochloricum) or quinine sulfate (Chininum sulfuricun) has an extremely bitter taste. For internal use in children, tasteless products such as Euchinin or Aristochin are often used, but the dosage of the two must be increased by half compared with quinine hydrochloride. To avoid oral quinine, injection and enema methods can be used. In addition, internal administration of methylenblau, three○three (Peracrina), spirocid, stophan耳所, totaquina, malarcan, etc., or injection of Neosalvarsan, has considerable efficacy in treating malaria, especially the combination of arsenic and quinine. However, it is ultimately not as effective as the combination of plasmoquine and atabrine or quinine.</p>
<p>(2) Symptomatic Treatment: When the patient is shivering, warm their limbs with a hot compress or a hot water bag. If vomiting occurs, cocaine can be taken internally or injected. When fever occurs, use an ice pack on the head and take cool drinks made of hydrochloric acid or citric acid. When sweating, prevent colds. If excessive sweating occurs, opium preparations can be taken, or the skin can be wiped with alcohol, acetic acid, etc. For chronic malaria and malarial cachexia, pay attention to nutrition and use blood-tonifying and stomach-strengthening agents. For splenomegaly, electrical therapy, cold water perfusion, mercury ointment application, iodine injection, or splenectomy can be performed. For blackwater fever attacks, the patient must be kept absolutely quiet, cardiotonics should be injected, and calcium chloride should be taken internally or injected to stop hemolysis. Normal saline should be injected or given as an enema, and diuretics should be used to prevent renal tubule obstruction.</p>
<p>(3) Post-Illness Care: After malaria attacks stop, the blood must be repeatedly examined, and the malaria parasite provocation method should be used to allow the parasites dormant in the internal organs to enter the blood and continue treatment in order to achieve a radical cure. The residence should have fresh air and sufficient sunlight. The diet should consist of meat, beans, green vegetables, fresh fruits, milk, eggs, cod liver oil, etc., which are rich in calories and iron. To promote blood regeneration, appropriate exercise or warm baths should be taken, and iron and arsenic agents that stimulate hematopoietic function, such as 奥拍太純, 補爾神, 万利康 etc., should be injected, or chicken Cinchona Iron wine and liver preparations such as 利凡命 should be taken internally. If anemia is too severe, a blood transfusion should be performed with a blood type that is compatible. For chronic malaria and malarial cachexia, it is advisable to choose a mountainous area of 1,500 to 2,000 meters for changing places to recuperate to increase red blood cells.</p>
<p>Prevention of Malaria</p>
<p>Anyone living in a malaria-endemic area or traveling to that area should take antimalarial drugs to prevent infection. If quinine is used, 0.2 grams can be taken on the first day, and the dose can be doubled every other day, repeated continuously, or one tablet of chicken Cinchona bark plasmoquine can be taken every night until malaria no longer occurs in the area or four weeks after leaving the area, which is often effective. In addition, avoid mosquito bites. The residence should be chosen in a high and dry area, because malaria mosquitoes prefer to fly low, especially in high-rise buildings. Sunflowers, etc. can be planted in the courtyard to keep the soil dry and clean, making it difficult for mosquitoes to hide. Mosquito nets should be hung on the bed, and the windows should be fitted with screens. If mosquitoes enter the room, pyrethrum can be burned to drive them away. When going out, using veils, gloves, or applying fresh 稌椽 sweat to exposed parts of the body provides more comprehensive protection.</p>
<p>For public prevention of malaria, British physician Ross advocated eradicating malaria mosquitoes and eliminating their means of transmission. The emphasis is on the government setting up specialists to improve low-lying and humid land within the territory, filling ponds and marshes, and opening rivers for diversion to completely drain stagnant water so that mosquitoes cannot breed. Gutter ditches should be watered with kerosene and other things on time to kill their larvae. The United States and other countries have worked hardest on this, and towns in the Panama area have already achieved results. German physician Koch advocated eradicating malaria parasites in the blood of patients and eliminating the source of transmission. The emphasis is on the government implementing malaria physicians who are government officials, stipulating prevention and treatment methods, and enforcing them on the general public during the malaria outbreak season so that those suffering from malaria can be radically cured. Italy and other countries follow this the most, and it is also effective.</p>
<p>The Malaria Committee of the League of Nations, in view of the different socio-economic conditions of various countries and the different living conditions of the people, found that it was not easy to imitate the effective methods of other countries. Therefore, in 1928, it publicly announced antimalarial guidelines, differentiating between urgent and non-urgent matters, proceeding in an orderly manner, first emphasizing the treatment of malaria to reduce the source of infection, and then studying the types of malaria mosquitoes, habits, and breeding sites based on local conditions and environment, selecting appropriate prevention methods, and planning fundamental construction to improve social conditions and people's lives, so as to indirectly increase antimalarial capabilities. Finally, land improvement methods were implemented, drainage was carried out, and mosquitoes were eradicated to complete antimalarial work. Our people's lives are declining, and malaria is spreading more and more severely. The Ministry of Health has been implementing the national antimalarial guidelines step by step. If people across the country work together, we can complete it as early as possible. (The End)</p>

<p>To Messrs. Ling Wenqin, Huang Kutong, Si Ren, Chen Yiru, Zhang Yifan, Ye Daguang, Zhu Wenqing: Your manuscript fees for December have been settled. Please collect them in person at the accounting department of this office from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily, starting today until the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>Regarding a manuscript submitted to this publication under the pseudonym "Ying" entitled "The Causes of Price Drops": It has been with us for three to four months. Recently, due to year-end clearance of accumulated manuscripts, and because this publication values openness, believing that contributors expend brainpower and energy, we are happy to publish anything worthwhile. Thus, feeling this article still has some general reference value, we published it in issue No. 102 of this publication (23, 12, 24). We have now received a letter from Mr. Fang Caiying of the Economics Department of Nankai University in Tianjin, stating that the content of the article is identical to his article published in the 71st issue of the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao's Economic Weekly (July 11th), titled "The Seriousness and Causes of the Sharp Decline in Prices in China in Recent Years," which is blatant plagiarism. In addition to replying to Mr. Fang and canceling the payment as required, we originally intended to publish the name of the plagiarist. However, considering it might be a temporary impulse of material desire and ignorance of the shamefulness of plagiarism, we hope they can repent their past mistakes, make a serious effort, and improve daily. Who knows, someday they might become a writer. It depends on how the submitter under the pseudonym "Ying" conducts themselves from now on. Therefore, we will temporarily withhold their disclosure.

<h3 id="e261">Commercial News: Financial Call Loan Interest Reduced by Seven Points <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The silver dollar market has largely cleared all year-end settlements, and with the bank holiday, the situation has become sluggish. Yesterday, the call loan interest rate for both morning and afternoon sessions was 4.8%, a decrease of seven points compared to the previous day. Transactions in call loan drafts amounted to over 2.4 million in the morning session for transfers, over 300,000 in new transactions, over 400,000 in the afternoon session, over 600,000 in transactions through the Small Exchange Association, over 900,000 in redemptions of silver pawn loans, over 800,000 in new loans, over 400,000 in remittances from various routes, and over 29.9 million in receipts and payments by private banks. Receipts and payments are at a standstill due to the bank holiday. The subsidiary currency market also showed weakness. In the morning session, Jiangnan small silver fell to 9 yuan, trading at 845 yuan. In the afternoon session, it slightly recovered by 3 yuan, changing to 848 yuan. As a result, it still fell by 6 yuan compared to the previous day. Transaction volume was 4,000 jiao in the morning session and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver was 759 yuan in the morning session, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Although it slightly recovered by a few jiao in the afternoon session to 759.6 jiao, the result was still a decrease of 1.4 yuan compared to the previous day. Transaction volume was 120,000 jiao in the morning session and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Copper coins remained at 306,000 wen, the same as the previous day, with a transaction volume of 38,862 strings of cash, equivalent to 12,700 yuan in silver.</p>

<h3 id="e262">Securities: Government Bonds Faced Another Downturn Last Week <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Trading Only Conducted for Two Days Due to New Year Holiday</p>
<p>Market Price Dropped by About 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Last week coincided with the end and beginning of the year. The end of the year was a market closure for brokers to settle accounts, and the beginning of the year was a three-day New Year holiday. Therefore, trading was only conducted for two days. During this long holiday period, although there was no significant progress or major obstacles in the political situation, the call loan interest rate rose to a new high of 6%, retreating only by 5 points during the relaxation. The tightness of the money market is undeniable. This is because the banking sector is completely tight, and depositors' withdrawals to purchase government bonds and for interest payment needs are extremely busy. The banking sector itself is solely engaged in speculation and has not changed its fixed policy of not speculating in government bonds. The previous rumor that HSBC Bank had shipped back 20 million yuan in cash from Hong Kong has not materialized. The Central Bank and the Bank of Communications prepared 10 million yuan for release, but only about 4 million yuan were actually transacted. Most transactions failed to materialize due to incompatible conditions. Therefore, borrowing is quite difficult. Considering the tightness of Shanghai's money market, there is no possibility of easing at present. However, the government is actively planning countermeasures. The market sentiment for government bonds is mostly bearish due to the above-mentioned factors. Short positions in the 16th issue are at least 7 to 8 million, and there are multiple others with short positions of 2 to 3 million. If there is a slight change in the money market, the rebound will be very rapid. Otherwise, there is a possibility of a further decline of 1 to 2 yuan. In terms of trends, the largest previous decline saw the 20-roll, 20-customs bonds fall below the 50 yuan mark, reaching 48 yuan and some change. The rebound then pushed above 50 yuan, with the 20-roll reaching above 51 yuan. This renewed downturn may break through the 50 yuan mark again, making it difficult to avoid seeing the previous low price again. However, it is necessary to be cautious about the implementation of government countermeasures. Last week, trading was only conducted on Friday, January 4th, and Saturday, January 5th. The call loan interest rate was 5.5% on both days. On Friday, the entire day trended downward due to selling by the Northern Consortium and the 21st issue, falling by 2 to 8 jiao compared to the year-end closing price of the previous year. On Saturday, the financial sector sold slightly, with issues 4 and 5 selling more. There were also unfounded rumors in the market, and the market price fell for three consecutive sessions. Although the closing price rebounded, it was only temporary short covering on the surface. Whether it has the ability to continue to rise depends on the level of call loan interest rates and whether the financial sector has buying interest as a prerequisite. As a result of last week's market prices, the decline ranged from 3 to 4 jiao to 1.2 to 3 yuan. The total transaction volume was 27,666,200 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Poets and Poetry <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>There is a section in the Suiyuan Shihua that discusses poets. It is very strange and very reasonable. It says, "Wang Xizhuang, Guanglu, wrote a preface for someone, saying, 'A poet is not necessarily someone who can write poetry. If one's mind is detached and one is gentle, even if one cannot read a single word, they are a true poet. If one's mind is petty and one is mundane, even if one spends all day poring over words and writing lengthy works, they are not a poet.'" This passage is very reasonable. One cannot become a poet casually, and it is especially difficult to become this kind of poet. Anyone can write poetry, but not everyone has talent. And so-called talent includes many elements, such as keen observation and rich emotion. If we were to discuss what constitutes keen observation, I am afraid we could not finish in a short time. Watching clouds is a very common thing, everyone can see them, but the clouds in the eyes of a poet are different from those in the eyes of an ordinary person. They can imagine many wonderful things from the clouds. The scene of snowfall is visible to everyone. Others only think that the sky is snowing and that everything in the universe is white, nothing more. But in the eyes of a poet, it is different. There are two lines of doggerel from the ancients that describe snowfall: "The river is a blur, the well mouth a black hole." It seems extremely ordinary, but in fact, it describes the snow scene very well. If we go to the countryside and go out to see it when it is snowing heavily, we will know the wonderfulness of these two lines of poetry. This is something that everyone can see, but others do not know that it can be used as poetic material. Good poems are often very ordinary, known to everyone, but not spoken by everyone. Everything in the world can be made into poetry. For example, the seller of hard sesame cakes at the door always shouts at night. Ordinary people hear it and do not feel much. But the poet hears it and can think that the seller of hard sesame cakes will one day not be able to do business. Thus, they imagine a child who buys hard sesame cakes every day, suddenly not hearing the seller of hard sesame cakes shout at the door one day. The child guesses that he may have died of old age, or that he was carelessly run over by a tram on the road, or that he was sick. Because the seller of hard sesame cakes once told the child that he was old and had no sons. So the child imagines that he may be sick in bed and no one is buying him medicine. This poem, by the child not being able to buy sesame cakes, highlights the sadness of the old man who sells hard sesame cakes on the reverse side. It is very moving. There is also a poem describing a seller of hard sesame cakes. The author is Mr. Xu Ji. The general idea is that now no one buys Western pastries, who will still buy hard sesame cakes? These two lines alone highlight the backwardness of Chinese small handicrafts and the sadness of the proletariat. This is another kind of wonderfulness. There is also a poem describing a wet nurse. This poem was published in Free Talk. I do not remember the author clearly. It says that a rural woman sacrifices her own child, but comes to the city to provide milk to the children of the rich. I was very moved at the time. This is also a good poem. Therefore, writing poetry requires a keen eye to see what others have not seen, and also requires rich emotions. The examples mentioned above are all very ordinary things, but after being melted by the poet's mind, they become very beautiful and moving things. Poetry, this thing, does not need to be looked for everywhere. It is right in front of you, but it only depends on whether you have the talent of a poet. There is no need to pore over books or go to various places to look for beautiful scenery. Some people have to look for plum blossoms in the snow in winter, and have to look at the moon in autumn, and then they can have poetry. Those are not poets. Chen Mingqing of the Ming Dynasty said, "There is a kind of ready-made writing between heaven and earth, such as the dimness of clouds and objects, the pouring of rivers and seas, and the various strange trees and birds in front of us. It is up to me to ponder and appreciate them. The Creator is not poor, nor stingy." So it is said that the realm of poetry is very broad. Perhaps some scholars read ten thousand volumes of books and write poetry all day long, but there is not a single good poem. But extremely beautiful lines of poetry can flow from the mouths of rural workers. This is the reason why many people now like to read ballads.</p>
<p>In addition to this, I believe that poetry must also be beautiful. The beauty I am talking about is the beauty of nature, not the beauty of carved words and phrases. For example, the Tang Dynasty poem, "Park the carriage and sit loving the maple forest in the evening, frost leaves are redder than February flowers." The words and phrases are not necessarily that beautiful, but the imagery is very beautiful. This is the beauty of nature. If you carve the words and phrases, you will never have such beautiful poetic meaning. When we read the poems of the ancients, they each have their own style. They are absolutely different. Li Bai's boldness is different from Su Dongpo's boldness. Du Fu is different from Bai Juyi. Tao Yuanming is different from Wang Wei. This is because everyone's nature is different, so poetry can never be learned from others. Even if you learn, you cannot learn it. It is better to see it from yourself. Say what you want to say. Sometimes there may be good poems. Shen Wancun of the Qing Dynasty has a poem that says, "The body is at ease and everything is idle, the sun sets and a village is quiet. Taking the child to the bright moon, watching people's shadows on the wall." It is quite leisurely and pleasing. This is the benefit of being willing to say your own words. The matter is very ordinary. It is just that adults lead children to stroll outside the village at night. However, the imagery is very beautiful. In this way, we can know what poetry is. If someone wants to ask how to write good poetry, how to become a poet? Then I can only ask him to think about it himself. I am sorry that I cannot tell this secret.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Visiting Thousand Buddha Mountain <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>If you want me to talk about the benefits of Thousand Buddha Mountain, the benefits are not in itself, because looking at the peaks and shadows from the streets of Jinan, it does not seem to be very beautiful or magnificent. What is so particularly moving about the yellow steep slopes, randomly dotted with ink-black cypress trees? Perhaps in spring and summer, the slopes are covered with green grass, and at dusk, the peaks are smeared with pale blue smoke, making it very beautiful when viewed from a distance. But this is just the scenery common to ordinary mountains, and the characteristics of Thousand Buddha Mountain cannot be recognized from this. But you should slowly climb up the mountain, cross the temple, and climb to the rocky peak. Then turn around and suddenly see the Daming Lake, like a basin, lying in the city of Jinan with its myriad homes and hearths, and the Yellow River, like a belt, winding around the vast wilderness. Only then will you suddenly realize why Thousand Buddha Mountain is loved by tourists and has become a famous scenic spot in northern China. It must be here.</p>
<p>When I went to visit, it was in winter, but because it had not snowed yet, the mountain road was very easy to walk. Moreover, for the past two or three years, I had been living in cities in the south of the Yangtze River, and all the roads I walked were flat. Once I encountered a mountain slope that was not very steep, it was as if I had suddenly met an old friend. Climbing up was really interesting. Although I was a little breathless and tired, when I looked back, the view gradually expanded, and the streets and walls that restricted my body and mind had completely disappeared. I also felt infinite comfort and my spirit was doubled. The mountain road leading to the temple is paved with stone slabs about a foot wide and more than five feet long, and there are short walls built on both sides, which is very clean and tidy. I think this was built specifically for people who worship Buddha. Otherwise, the place behind the temple, where you can only reach the peak and enjoy the scenery to the fullest, would not require tourists with straw sandals and cloth shoes to explore and find their own paths. At the top, the wind is extremely strong. On the one hand, you have to prevent the wind from blowing off your hat, and on the other hand, you have to use your hands to climb on the rocky ground. From time to time, there are also short thorny bushes that catch people's clothes. Therefore, climbing is extremely embarrassing, but the joy and excitement cannot be reduced in the slightest. This is probably because the more dangerous the mountain is to climb, the more it can increase its majesty.</p>
<p>When I reached the top, it was about 3:00 in the afternoon. The trains on the Jiaoji Railway, spraying milky white smoke, came from afar. The way they moved in succession was very similar to a group of black sows walking clumsily in the mud. Compared with the area of the city of Jinan and Daming Lake, it is no longer the "half-city of mountains and half-city of lake" that Lao Can saw. The city has been completely expanded by the infusion of the railway. The countless red roofs in the west are marking the fact that the modernization of the ancient Jinan has reached a considerable degree. In the future, tourists may even be able to sit comfortably on the tram to the foot of the mountain. I only saw some colors and outlines at the top, and thinking about this was after I went down the mountain.</p>
<p>Although I did not see the surging situation of "the Yellow River water coming from the sky" this time, the posture of the snake lazily sleeping in the wilderness was enough for a traveler to rejoice. The river body showed a width of about thirty or forty feet at the turning point, which was light yellow in color compared to the clear water of Daming Lake. The rest was like a light yellow ribbon, and if the river body did not shine slightly, it would be indistinguishable from the northern wilderness.</p>
<p>Going down the mountain is more difficult than going up. You have to be careful not to lose your footing and dare not look into the distance. Only then do you realize the hardship of visiting the mountain, but people are still happy and excited, because the majestic scenery of the north has been painted in their hearts.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Peanut Boat <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>As soon as winter comes, some out-of-town merchants' boats all dock on the riverbank, a long row of them. There are scale-making boats from Zhejiang, small fishing boats from north of the Yangtze River, umbrella repair boats, and also boats that collect old goods. At the same time, peanut boats also come.</p>
<p>Most of those boats come at a certain time every winter and go back to their hometowns in early spring next year. They plant some rented fields in their hometowns, but because there are too many mouths to feed, they cannot make ends meet. So they come to foreign villages in the winter when there is nothing to do in the fields to do some odd jobs. However, the years are not auspicious, and those small boats cannot do good business in various villages and towns either.</p>
<p>A boat from north of the Yangtze River selling peanuts has been docked on the river beach in front of our school for many days.</p>
<p>Every day after class, I take a leisurely walk along the riverbank with a colleague. There has been a small peanut stall on the riverbank these past few days. On the boat, there are three or four children, five or six years old. Their bodies are tattered and unkempt, as if they had rolled around in a muddy puddle. They have bare feet and their little faces are covered with wrinkles. The riverbank is their playground. They roll stones, bricks, hawthorns, and broken tin cans as toys. They play with those sports equipment energetically.</p>
<p>These ragged children are from that peanut boat.</p>
<p>When the sun sets, an old man in his fifties comes back from the small street carrying a peanut pole. He stops the pole effortlessly on the riverbank and then turns onto the springboard. A middle-aged woman sticks her head out of the reed shed on the boat. Her dirty face shows a trace of hopeful smile, along with a kind voice.</p>
<p>"How many coins did you get?"</p>
<p>The old man's sallow face sinks, he curls his lips, and steps onto the bow of the boat. The boat sways, but he does not answer. He climbs into the boat shed.</p>
<p>He finds a cigarette butt in the reed shed and turns back to the shore. He counts the pile of copper coins thrown in the wooden bucket, frowning as he counts. The three ragged children surround him, calling,</p>
<p>"Old Dad, Old Dad!"</p>
<p>"Old Dad, give me a copper coin!"</p>
<p>He mumbles and scolds all the children away.</p>
<p>We go up to him and chat.</p>
<p>"Old man, how much business do you do every day?"</p>
<p>"Sir, this year is worse than in previous years!"</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>"I only exchange for 1,800 cash..."</p>
<p>"These days, rice is more expensive than in previous years! It's hard to live!"</p>
<p>"How many mouths do you have to feed on the boat?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, sir, there are seven people in the family on the boat: the old woman, the eldest son, the daughter-in-law, and three young children. I earn 1,800 cash a day. That's not enough to live on!"</p>
<p>"Is your land north of the Yangtze River also barren?"</p>
<p>"It's barren too! The years are bad, and farming is not lucky. I can't do business either. Last year, I sold peanuts here and earned 4,000 or 5,000 cash a day. That was good. This year, I earn at most 2,000 cash a day!"</p>
<p>He tells us that this small business cannot be done anymore and that he wants to raise some capital to sell sugar cane and oranges.</p>
<p>Smoke rises from the stern of the boat. The old man's young daughter-in-law is warming wild firewood in the stove to cook porridge, blowing fire through a bamboo tube, puffing.</p>
<p>The old man moves the peanut stall on the riverbank back to the boat. It is already getting dark.</p>
<p>On the dim river in the twilight, we watch the old and young of the family of seven on the boat, squatting around the stern, having their supper of a pot of thin porridge.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Requirements for Future Literary Criticism <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Sheng</p>
<p>As a characteristic of the Chinese literary world in 1934, I believe that the gradual progress of literary criticism onto the right track should be solemnly put forward.</p>
<p>Serious "author studies" replaced the so-called "impressions," and sharp "book and newspaper criticism" replaced the so-called "after-reading impressions." These are all good phenomena in the past year.</p>
<p>There used to be a group of writers" who believed that the effect of criticism was to make writers "put down their pens," but in fact, good criticism only makes writers more active, and it will lead the latter to move forward on the correct path!</p>
<p>Inheriting the achievements already made in 1934, will literary criticism in 1935 present us with an even more complete posture? We, the readers, sincerely hope so.</p>
<p>In the midst of hope, I would like to put forward a few small requests here:</p>
<p>When building new literary criticism, the introduction of foreign literary theories is really necessary. I remember that Shuimo Bookstore, Guanghua Bookstore, Dajiang Bookstore, etc. used to publish complete sets of literary theory series, but recently, such books seem to have been published too few. Therefore, as in literary creation, large-scale translation and introduction work is also needed in criticism in the future. This is one of my requests.</p>
<p>"Critics should not only criticize others, but also criticize themselves, not only criticize each other, but also self-criticize. All bad criticisms should also be the object of criticism..." Mr. Ren Baige's these few sentences (see Taibai issue 2) are indeed very correct. Today we see...some people hang the big sign of "author study" but only do the work of patching up chapters and sentences, and some others, more clever, cling to Gide, while the more honest ones pull in Babbitt, all shamelessly "criticizing"...Therefore, my second point of request is: On the basis of the new literary criticism, give these colorful theories appropriate blows - criticism!</p>
<p>Literary criticism should certainly make the greatest effort to prevent old writers from becoming corrupt, but at the same time, it should never forget to discover new writers from various newspapers and magazines and guide them forward; and it should not only find promising new writers, but also pay attention to those literary apprentices who are just starting to write, and use various opportunities to help them technically and in terms of subject matter, and encourage them: The constant emergence of new writers is the only way to keep the literary world young. New literary criticism that neglects this aspect will lose its own meaning.</p>
<p>In addition, I have one additional request! I believe that it is not enough to have just a few author studies in general literary magazines and a column of "book review criticism" to undertake the important task of new literary criticism. Therefore, a specialized literary criticism magazine is necessary. Although there were one or two literary criticism magazines in the magazine year of 1934, they were clearly not satisfactory to us. What we hope for is a literary criticism publication that introduces correct foreign theories, constantly reviews our literary world, and can supervise, encourage, and help all writers and beginners!</p>
<h3 id="e268">Flies (6) <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— By piradnello, translated by Xi Dichén</p>
<p>The sun shone through the horizontal window near the manger, reflecting on a face that no longer looked human: swollen, with the nose missing; the lips were black and distended. The sound of phlegm grew louder, like a howl. In the dark, curly hair, a piece of straw sparkled in the sunlight.</p>
<p>Seeing this scene, the three men seemed to be repelled by terror, stopping abruptly and staring at him. The sound of mule hooves clattered on the cobblestones of the stable. Then, Sa Luo walked up to the dying man and called out intimately:</p>
<p>"Ji La, Ji La, the doctor is here."</p>
<p>Néli struck the mules at the manger; on the nearby wall, there seemed to be a shadow of another animal. It turned out to be: the image of the donkey living in the stable, imprinted on the wall by constant rubbing.</p>
<p>Hearing the second call, Chai Lu stopped the phlegm in his throat. He struggled to open his terrified, already dim, inflamed eyes, and opened his terrible mouth to groan, as if it were burning inside.</p>
<p>"I'm going to die!"</p>
<p>"No, no," Sa Luo replied anxiously, "the doctor is here, we invited him; can you see him?"</p>
<p>"Take me to the village!" Chai Lu said with difficulty and pleadingly, unable to close his lips. "Ah, good God!"</p>
<p>"Okay, look, the mules are here," Sa Luo immediately replied.</p>
<p>"If there's no other way, I'll carry you in my arms, Ji La, I'll take you to the village!" Néli rushed over, bent down and said to him. "Don't be afraid!"</p>
<p>Hearing Néli's gentle voice, Chai Lu turned his head as if he didn't recognize him at first, stared at him with his inflamed eyes, then moved one arm and grabbed Néli's belt.</p>
<p>"Child, is that you?"</p>
<p>"Me? Of course it's me! Are you crying? Don't cry, Ji La, don't cry! It's nothing serious!"</p>
<p>Néli placed one hand on his trembling, sobbing chest, the pitiful sobs unable to break through his throat. Then, Chai Lu choked, shook his head violently, raised one hand, grabbed Néli's neck, and pulled him towards himself.</p>

<h3 id="e269">The Liberation from Depression <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Bǐng</p>
<p>Young people in today's world, whether employed or unemployed, share a very common problem: depression. This is indeed a sign of the times; global turmoil, social darkness, and the decline of human relationships are all wounding the hearts of young people in a chain reaction. Under these circumstances, it is practically impossible not to fall into depression.</p>
<p>Young people are passionate and full of fiery blood, just like Tao Jianping in "Peach and Plum Calamity." They dare to speak and act, willing to sacrifice themselves for justice, regardless of other consequences. However, reality is precisely the opposite, so the depression of young people mostly begins here.</p>
<p>This responsibility should be assigned to society. However, there is also a large proportion of young people whose depression does not stem from this source. After spending some time in society, they feel indifferent to everything, yet the shadow of depression still covers each of their hearts, deeply. This requires seeking solutions from within oneself.</p>
<p>When young people fall into depression, the danger is not only that depression leads to pessimism, and pessimism leads to negativity, self-abandonment, and then to depravity and suicide. This is an inevitable trend. When a young person reaches this point, the danger is obvious. This is not only a sacrifice for the young person themselves but also a major loss for society.</p>
<p>This requires remediation. From a broad perspective, it is certainly a social issue, but there is also a need for rigorous self-examination and efforts to recover. This is a question of personal responsibility. Many people are trapped in a state of depression, but they can ultimately use reasonable methods to safely navigate through it and reach the shore of success. What is the method of liberating oneself from depression? In my opinion, the only way is for our spirit to have something to which to attach itself.</p>
<p>Christians are all cheerful, and monks are also broad-minded and physically robust. This is the effect of entrusting one's spirit to religious belief. Hermits and men of letters devote themselves to landscapes, fishing, drinking wine, and composing poetry, and then their depression is alleviated. Throughout history, countless writers and scientists, all those whose spirits have been entrusted to something, have lived their lives happily and achieved extraordinary accomplishments. Otherwise, they spend their days frowning and living a miserable life, never tasting a bit of the sweetness of life. Regarding the entrustment of the spirit, Yuan Zhonglang explained it most thoroughly in a letter to his friend Li Ziran. I have excerpted a few words here to serve as a conclusion:</p>
<p>"…Human emotions must be entrusted to something to be joyful. Therefore, some entrust themselves to chess, some to beauty, some to skills, and some to literature. The enlightened people of ancient times were a level higher simply because their emotions had a place to be entrusted, and they were unwilling to waste time in a superficial and empty manner. Every time I see people without a place to entrust their emotions, they are busy all day long, as if they have lost something, worrying about nothing, and not enjoying the scenery. Even they themselves do not know why. This is a living hell. What else can be said about iron beds, copper pillars, mountains of knives, and trees of swords? Pity, pity!…"</p>
<h3 id="e270">Fantasy <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Jiǎ Chén</p>
<p>People are all bound by the colorful realities of life, and this bondage is inescapable for anyone. At the same time, reality is unsatisfactory for eight or nine out of ten people, seen as a net of suffering. Therefore, the only way to temporarily relieve the fatigue of reality and leisurely enter a state of joy beyond reality is through fantasy, or, it can also be said, ideals. Therefore, everyone likes to be close to fantasy, fantasizing about the brilliance of the days ahead, fantasizing that there will be splendid fruits of dreams in the future. Thus, an invisible, magnificent utopia stands in their minds. They use the sweetness of fantasy to smooth out the wounds of reality, painting as many colorful images as possible on the fantasy to forget the various sorrows of reality. Therefore, the existence of fantasy is worth cherishing. Almost no one does not regard fantasy as a more intimate companion than anything else and is unwilling to leave it for a moment. If you can be closer to it for one more minute, you can gain one more minute of comfort and tenderness. During this gained time, you are also isolating yourself from the suffering of reality. Conversely, if you cannot be close to fantasy, you will lose some enjoyment of comfort and tenderness, while on the other hand, you will endure some more pain and torment from reality.</p>
<p>Like being so busy during the day that you are dizzy and dazed, barely having time to stop. The entanglement of the day really makes your soul numb. What joy is there to talk about? Moreover, in the bustling human affairs of the day, you often encounter various frustrating and unpleasant events for no reason. When evening comes, you stretch lazily and fall onto the bed, exhaling a long, stuffy breath. At this moment, fantasy, like a woman in a beautiful dress filled with fragrance, smiles and lightly steps into your heart, making a sweet visit. Then, you unconsciously close your eyes slightly, as if awake but also as if confused. In that instant, the thick dust and fatigue of life that have been pressing on your soul during the day have completely fallen away. At the same time, you are thus intoxicated in the gentle cradle of fantasy.</p>
<p>When you encounter some disappointments in the real environment, or spiritual unhappiness, and there is no way to restore it with human effort, the only method is to seek it from the gift of fantasy. Whatever you cannot find in real life, no matter how rare, even a desire that is forever a dream, you can get everything from fantasy. Fantasy is indeed an indispensable place of rest for the human soul, changing your gray feeling towards a joyless real life, further strengthening your interest, deepening your attachment to life, and encouraging you to move forward.</p>
<p>However, fantasy should not be too boundless and limitless. The most appropriate thing is to slowly stretch along the edge of reality. If it deviates from reality too far, as vague as the clouds in the sky above the sea, then permanent fantasy is just fantasy, not easily turning into the rich fruit of reality. Then, always fantasizing throughout your life will inevitably lead to feeling empty throughout your life. In this way, all fantasies become bubbles, coming without a trace and going without a trace, ultimately leaving only a faint, seemingly confused wisp of blue smoke in your heart.</p>
<p>Therefore, although fantasy is a relaxing cradle for the human soul, it must also have weight. Being too empty and vague will not only lose the warmth and comfort of fantasy, but may also cause infinite frustration. If you have already suffered the disasters of reality, and still feel sadness because of fantasy, it will be even more unbearable. Therefore, it is okay to indulge in fantasy, but do not completely deviate from your actual life and abilities. Like climbing a mountain, first estimate your strength, then step by step go up. Stop when you can't climb, don't force yourself to climb again. Because if you fall, it's not a joke. Fantasy is also like this. Fantasizing about the Three Divine Mountains, so unattainable, is ultimately still distressing.</p>
<h3 id="e271">After Seeing the Public Performance of Peiming Girls' High School <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Luó Píng</p>
<p>Although it is the dead of winter, the public performances of various schools are very lively. The successive public performances of the John, Guanghua, Zhirenyong, Liangjiang, and Guohua drama clubs may not have achieved much, but at least they are a sign of vitality in the theatrical world.</p>
<p>This time, the public performance of Peiming Girls' High School did not have enough time for preparation beforehand, relying on the efforts of a few people, but the results obtained were quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>In order to raise funds for the construction of a school building, the performance was held over two days. The reporter only saw the program on the last day.</p>
<p>In addition to the songs and dances influenced by Li Jinhui and the magic tricks performed by elementary school students, three relatively meaningful plays were performed. In the afternoon: (1) Before Lunch (2) Oppression (3) By the Huangpu River; In the evening, only the latter two were performed. The successful ones were only the latter two plays.</p>
<p>Because they are all old plays, it seems unnecessary to talk about the scripts themselves here.</p>
<p>Compared from the stage, "Oppression" was better than "By the Huangpu River". In "Oppression," due to the interest of the story and the excellence of the actors, it was able to capture the emotions of the audience.</p>
<p>Shen Ruchen, who played the female tenant, and Li Bihua, who played the male tenant, performed very hard. Their rich dramatic talent and fluent, clear dialogue were the biggest reasons for the success of this play. In particular, it is worth surprising that Shen Ruchen achieved such great success without having undergone many rehearsals. Li Bihua often sticks his tongue out when speaking, which is a minor flaw. Tang Renliang, who played the old lady, and Hu Lanzhi, who played the old nanny, were both able to match the identities of the characters in the play. Zhang Cai's portrayal of the police officer, often putting his hands in his pockets, was also a shortcoming. The performance in the evening was more complete than the performance in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The next is "By the Huangpu River". In my opinion, this opera is not very suitable for female students to perform. Although this is almost subjective, on the one hand, because there is a kind of rugged style of dockworkers in this play, although it is not absolutely impossible to express it, at least it will lose a little color.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the painful groans, the cries of life, the resentful songs, and the heroic shouts of the dockworkers here should be sung by a bass, but this has become a problem. Because of this, the performance of the entire play was affected. The actors were all average, but not serious enough. Zheng Senlan, who played the old man, was better.</p>
<p>As for "Before Lunch," due to the lengthy dialogue and the sparse rehearsals, the effect of the performance of this play was inferior to "Oppression" and "By the Huangpu River." The actors did not pay much attention to small actions. The more commendable one was Shen Aizhen, who played the third sister.</p>
<p>All the shortcomings cannot cover up the achievements of this public performance. At least we discovered many girls with dramatic talent, adding a hope for the future of this theatrical world.</p>

<p>— Xiǎo Yīng</p>
<p>Winter comes, autumn goes; winter goes, spring comes, just like that, circling eternally.</p>
<p>It’s really fast, in a blink of an eye, another year has passed in a muddle, just like a dream. What was the situation in the dream? At that time, it was clear, but after that? I can't answer, leaving myself with a thin gauze-like net!</p>
<p>No matter how thin the net is, what cannot be denied is that the wrinkles on my forehead are increasing and deepening... Looking at myself in the mirror, I thought, "Ah, you heartstrings of a wanderer, what do you hope for? Your complexion is taking your gray fate to the edge of the tomb…" Involuntarily, a wave of sourness welled up in my heart, reaching my throat and then choking me.</p>
<p>Isn’t that right? The New Year's streets are bustling with activity. That group of people moving are countless heads!</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Is that a happy appearance? But who can be sure that there are no bitter tears inside!</p>
<p>Originally, when it came to this time, I had to find a way to hide, otherwise, the different faces of the creditors would really be too much to bear. But this year, I didn't hide. I feel that those different faces are lovely. Why hide from that typical expression?</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Some people say that the South is a paradise, because the climate, scenery, and so on in the South give people a pleasant atmosphere and feeling.</p>
<p>That's right, I think. Isn’t that right? Although it is in the cold winter, the vegetable gardens in Jiangnan are still lush and green. Although the weeping willows by the creek have withered, the river is still flowing nearby!</p>
<p>Here, I miss the North, which I have been away from for seven years.</p>
<p>In fact, the North and the South are obviously different. In the North, it is now the time to freeze. No, the heavy snow flying about is probably over the ankles.</p>
<p>Although the North is bleak, it has a unique charm. After the heavy snow, in the season of fierce wind, isn't there a large group of men and women skating at the ice rink in front of Yilan Hall? Laughing in all sorts of ways? But, this is the charm of the North! How fast, in a blink of an eye, another seven years have passed since I left!</p>
<p>Longing is deeply buried.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Talking About Killing <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Gē Bái</p>
<p>The New Year is coming, and every family is killing chickens and ducks. Suddenly, a whim came over me, and I thought of Mr. Feng Zikai's "Protecting Life Collection". My aunt, who fasted and chanted scriptures all year round, asked me to buy it and send it back from the post office. My uncle died young in middle age, and a posthumous child died before the age of two. My aunt complained about her bad fate and vowed to fast and chant scriptures all year round to redeem herself. Moreover, every year she went to Putuo Mountain in Hangzhou to pay homage and offer incense. She never shook her head at the donation book of the monks. She released fish and snakes, and chanted some kind of scripture, saying that they would never be caught again. With such painstaking efforts, she still fell from the Buddha hall last year and followed her deceased husband to the underworld. On the way to the hospital, the string of prayer beads was still tightly held. It is said that after she died, it could not be removed. Thinking of that "Protecting Life Collection," I couldn't help but chant "Amen" non-stop.</p>
<p>This year, I attended two banquets: (1) a wedding, (1) a full-month celebration, both of which were vegetarian banquets. The host of the former was a great philanthropist. He said that he was unwilling to slaughter many living beings for his son's wedding, partly to create blessings for his descendants and partly to create blessings for the guests' descendants. This statement won many flattering words praising public virtue and many stories of good rewards for those who refrain from killing and release living beings. Thus, the host and guests dispersed happily. The latter was for an elderly couple who had a son, and it was obtained from the Goddess of Mercy who sends children in some famous mountain. He also said that he was unwilling to slaughter many living beings for his thirty-day-old child, so I listened to many stories of black fish repaying kindness again.</p>
<p>At that time, I was indeed moved. Thinking of the cruel images of killing chickens and ducks, philanthropists naturally could not bear to eat their meat after hearing their cries!</p>
<p>However, I was not born into a good family, and I don't know how to use any means to make money. To support myself, I also have to be slaughtered by others. Can this little bit of aroused emotion put on a mask to talk about refraining from killing and releasing living beings?</p>
<p>Moreover, reading the newspaper, I saw news of "exchanging children for food". Although I did not witness it with my own eyes, as long as I imagine it like killing chickens and ducks, the cries of many children who can shout "Mom, Dad" are a step further than the cries of "Ooo, gaa, gaa". I don't know what philanthropists who advocate refraining from killing and releasing living beings and creating blessings for their descendants think?</p>
<p>A sudden whim is ultimately just a sudden whim. In order to celebrate that my mental effort has not been completely squeezed out this year, the kitchen is already preparing to slaughter a chicken to eat a relatively sumptuous dinner. I no longer have the leisure to glance at the big rooster tied with straw on its feet struggling on the ground!</p>
<h3 id="e274">Heart Net <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Yě Fēi</p>
<p>I have been suffering from insomnia these past few nights. I don't know why? I don't understand myself. I toss and turn in bed, really suffering to the extreme. In the morning, I can't get up because I'm dizzy and have a headache. But for the sake of life, I have no choice but to get up and struggle. However, I can't cheer up. I have no appetite and can't hear anything. I'm dizzy all day long.</p>
<p>I took a mirror to look at myself and felt that the flesh on my face had been shaved off a lot in the past few days. The two lifeless eyes were also deeply sunken in their sockets. My complexion was terribly pale! I couldn't help but throw the mirror in my hand on the ground and sighed, throwing my dead-looking limbs on the bed.</p>
<p>My wife was very worried about me, but she didn't dare to ask me too much, for fear that I would lose my temper. She asked me several times if I wanted to see a doctor, but I always shook my head and mumbled, without saying a word. She was very bored and didn't understand what illness I had. The day before yesterday, she finally secretly asked a doctor to come and see me, and I didn't say yes or no. He took my pulse and said that I was restless. As long as I rested and recuperated peacefully and suffered less stimulation, I would slowly get better. But! It is really difficult for me to cut off my thoughts. These past few days, not only have I been unable to rest and recuperate peacefully, but I have also been thinking wildly more and more. So my illness has not only not been alleviated, but it is even progressing into a deeper realm! Yesterday, Dr. Zhou also came and gave me a prescription. I saw a very melancholy look on his face. Later, he only spoke a few words lightly to my wife:</p>
<p>"He needs to rest and recuperate peacefully. If he continues like this, it will be very dangerous..." But I heard it very clearly. I am not afraid of death. What I hate most is living half-dead. I don't want to rest and recuperate peacefully. Although I want to live, I can't stop the coming of death. However, when my heart can still think and still beat, I still want to think and beat. Naturally, when it can't think and stops beating, then everything will be over!</p>
<p>What's the point of being a human? A life worse than a cow or a horse, a mechanical life! The world is so unfair and snobbish. Human beings are so cold and cruel. All the encounters are vicious, fanged, blood-sucking ghosts. My blood has been sucked dry by them. I feel that my surroundings are full of nets of fear!</p>
<p>I deeply feel that the past was a dream, a nightmare! The present is still a dream, and the future may still be a dream!</p>
<p>The dreams of life are interwoven into a net, a dense heart net, to hold my heart. It is stretched very tight. It won't jump or open and close. Insomnia is still getting worse day by day. At night, the heart net shrinks even more severely. Therefore, I can't sleep after all. But in order to delay the moment before death, I still have to live, so I have to reluctantly get up and struggle!</p>
<h3 id="e275">Hometown Sound <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Jizi</p>
<p>One chilly, gloomy dusk. I, alone, carrying a heart attacked by the depression of life, went to the residence of a hometown friend I hadn't seen in seven years.</p>
<p>Entering the door, in a small, clean upstairs room, under the pale light, I and this long-separated friend, held hands tightly, looked at each other, speechless. After a while, he put a hand on my shoulder, and the other smoothed the long hair hanging on both sides of his cheeks. Affectionately and surprisedly, he said:</p>
<p>"Oh my, you've grown so big! I almost didn't recognize you... Your face is too haggard, too... well, how are you living?"</p>
<p>We sat down on the edge of the bed, which was close to the wall and the desk. Drinking Emei tea, eating melon seeds, we talked freely about everything since our separation, both happily and sadly. Later, we talked about the hometown in recent years, from the advance levy to the grain tax of the 80th year of the Republic, to how the people opposed paying the newly levied "emotional donation" this year, from planting opium to the rise and fall of the three forces of "blackening," "corruption," and "reddening," the decline of big landlords to becoming waiters in opium dens, farmers starving and becoming beggars, and those running morphine factories becoming rich...</p>
<p>"Some people say, 'The thick coal smoke smell in Chongqing city used to be, but now it is overwhelmed by the fragrance of opium.'" Is our city the same way? I asked, lying on the bed, intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>"Of course, it's no different. Oh, this summer, for a few days, my nostrils stopped being stuffed with this smoky atmosphere," he said, recalling.</p>
<p>I was very surprised and sat up to take a sip of tea.</p>
<p>"What? Is some military commander again arresting opium addicts to hang them?"</p>
<p>He pursed his lips and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>"What military commander! Don't you know Sichuan is a demonic place!"</p>
<p>I eagerly asked him to tell me what was going on, and he frowned and sighed, saying:</p>
<p>"It's like this: It is said that on the nineteenth day of the sixth lunar month, a strange old beggar woman came to our county. She didn't want the money people gave her, nor did she want rice, she didn't want anything, just shouted along the street, advising people to quit opium immediately. Later, she knelt in front of an opium shop, repeatedly urging people not to smoke, and saying that those who didn't listen and didn't quit opium would all not live past the middle of the seventh month... Later, the opium shop owner, fearing that he would scare away his customers, came out to drive the old beggar woman away, but she stubbornly insisted on not leaving, and finally the owner kicked her, and she immediately disappeared. Later…"</p>
<p>Speaking of this, he suddenly stopped. He seemed unwilling to say more about these ghostly and absurd things, staring at the melon seed shells in front of him without speaking. I anxiously pressed him:</p>
<p>"What happened later? Finish the story!"</p>
<p>He glanced at me and said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"The next afternoon, the opium shop owner who kicked the beggar woman suddenly died of heatstroke. So, some people made a fuss and spread rumors that the old beggar woman from yesterday was an incarnation of Guanyin Bodhisattva, and the owner was punished for insulting the Bodhisattva... Suddenly, the whole city was in an uproar, and all the 'retail shops' – opium shops – all closed their doors, and all the opium users hid their smoking paraphernalia, and some even burned them! Later, the county government panicked because they couldn't collect opium tax. Then, the government issued a notice: 'No one is allowed to spread rumors to confuse the public... or endanger public order.' In less than ten days, those opium addicts started smoking again!"</p>
<p>I burst out laughing, and he laughed too.</p>
<p>In the cold wind, with excitement and reluctance to part, I said goodbye to my friend and started on my way home. Right now, the curtain of memory still reflects...</p>
<p>"…Sichuan is a demonic place…"</p>
<p>These words. I don't understand why people are fascinated by demons and still haven't woken up!</p>

<h3 id="e281">A Brief History of the Development of Cinema (1) <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>(1) The Audience is the Master of the Film Industry</p>
<p>Audiences, the film industry is your industry. The reason why the film industry has reached its current level of development is that you have created it. The joys and sorrows of the audience are the laws that entrepreneurs abide by. From the very beginning of cinema, when a few "idle people" pooled some money, purchased a clumsy film projector, and shook out the dancing shadows of people in a dilapidated empty house, to the indescribable prosperity of today, the audience has always been the dictator and ruler of the film industry.</p>
<p>In the year 1900, whoever mentioned motion pictures would laugh. They considered themselves knowledgeable people and disdained to consider such trivial matters. Bankers turned a deaf ear when they heard that someone wanted to borrow capital from them to start a film business. Some poor people pooled their life savings and invested in the film industry, and their friends called them crazy. But when the day came, everyone ran to a dilapidated house to watch motion pictures. They saw that the film really did move, and everyone was surprised. They saw with their own eyes a train coming towards them. They saw with their own eyes a girl with hair curls who made them cry for her one moment and laugh through their tears the next. That was the later world-famous Mary Pickford. The people of that generation found those crude, jerky films very interesting. They unknowingly nurtured the beginning of a large enterprise, because the big bankers on the street knew that they liked to watch that kind of thing, so they loosened the strings of their money bags and began to invest in the film industry. Therefore, from the very beginning, the film industry belonged to the film audience.</p>
<p>Around 1923, the American film industry had already developed greatly. Samuel Goldwyn once gathered the most famous film critics from the American press and magazines, gave them generous salaries, and asked them to judge the merits of films before they were publicly released. As a result, the experiment was a complete failure, because what they thought was good, the audience didn't like to watch, and what they thought was bad, the audience welcomed. From this, we can see that the will of the audience cannot be directed by any expert. If an entrepreneur spends countless amounts of money to bring out a star, and the audience likes it and tells their friends, and everyone says it's good, then the entrepreneur's money is not wasted. Otherwise, if the audience just frowns slightly, the star will immediately lose their footing, and the entrepreneur's money will be like throwing it into the water. The income at the ticket office is Hollywood's only standard for estimating the value of stars, and that standard is determined by when everyone in the audience opens their wallets to buy tickets.</p>
<p>Therefore, all of you in the audience are the masters of the film industry, and the film industry is not an ordinary industry, but one of the six major enterprises in the United States. But in other industries, your position is not as important, whether it is in the steel industry, the cotton yarn industry, or the silk industry. Because the film industry is your own industry, it will be very beneficial and perhaps very interesting for you to know how the film industry started, how it developed, who are the heroes in the history of cinema, and a brief overview of the past thirty years, because the history of cinema is full of glory and romance. It contains lively and active characters, successful and failed experiences, sad and disappointing grievances, and ecstatic pleasures. We are in a modern position and can look back and unite the past traces, but our pioneers did not have the foresight to look forward. This is where our modern situation is superior.

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e282">Review of "Oliver Twist" <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Oliver Twist｜Cathay｜</p>
<p>After "Les Misérables," here is another novel by Dickens brought to the screen.</p>
<p>Regarding Dickens, I once mentioned him in my writing about "Les Misérables," and there is no need to introduce him now. Although he is not a very great writer, Chinese readers are very familiar with him. As for this "Oliver Twist," there was once a translation by Lin Qinnan, entitled "The Thief's History." Moreover, in the silent film era, "Oliver Twist" gave people a very deep impression.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly pointed out that the adaptation of literary works to the screen, in addition to illustrating the lack of themes in American films, is mainly because certain literary works can still coincide with the subjective requirements of filmmakers in the 1920s and 1930s. For example, due to the rapid collapse of the economic foundation at the current stage, there are tens of thousands of children wandering the streets and homeless in every city. Of course, they have to live. They have no other way of life other than begging or stealing. This phenomenon is naturally a hidden worry in the eyes of social figures, but they have no way to seek a thorough solution. Therefore, reformism is their only means. Therefore, the works of the British reformist Dickens have been repeatedly adapted.</p>
<p>Now, let us further explore Dickens' style from "Oliver Twist" itself, although this is through the screenwriting of Ending Mechan, and it is not easy to fully glimpse the face of the novel.</p>
<p>Like all reformers, Dickens saw the cruelty or lack of compassion of the noble class of the time. This is evident in the fact that the child Oliver could not get a penny when he asked the gentleman in the carriage for money, and that he received brutal punishment when he wanted another bowl of soup in the orphanage. Furthermore, the satirical depiction of the high-ranking group when Oliver was questioned in the orphanage is full of the author's resentment.</p>
<p>Similarly, Dickens also strongly disliked the group of thieves, such as Oliver's being beaten and the brutality of the thief leader Bill Sikes. Although he was pathologically depicting them, he gave some degree of sympathy to their being forced by life. Then, under this observation, Dickens put forward his own subjective views. That is, he disguised Oliver's grandfather and appeared among the rich, and he especially emphasized the kindness and benevolence of Bill Sikes' wife among the thieves. Finally, the wandering child was saved. The above-mentioned theme is really too suitable for American filmmakers.</p>
<p>However, in the expression of the film, it is not enough in any aspect. The director did the first few scenes very well, and the climax later was okay, but it was not expressed in many places. If it is said that the protagonist child is very pitiful, then this must be added to the audience's imagination to understand. The director cannot give the audience direct stimulation. Of course, it can also be seen that the child's acting skills are not very good, and the other actors in the play, such as the two larger little thieves, are unnatural performances. However, the personality of the old man in prison and the big thief are written quite vividly. As for the dullness and obscurity, it is naturally an inevitable result.</p>
<h3 id="e283">A Critique of "The Trail Drive" <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>"The Trail Drive" | Carlton</p>
<p>Using the simple and stalwart life of herdsmen in the vast American West as its material, weaving in elements of chivalry and adding some romantic interludes, the script produced has been common since the silent film era. Even now, with the development of sound films, in addition to performances featuring seductive jazz songs and dances, extravagant and decadent urban landscapes, and luxurious and decadent lifestyles, there are also many productions that draw on the aforementioned quiet and simple rural backgrounds and the bold and forthright stories of herdsmen. It's just a pity that few of them are good.</p>
<p>In fact, in recent years, when four-fifths of the earth has been plunged into turmoil, and during a period when the economic panic, livestock, slaughterhouse, and leather industries have all suffered great calamities, those herdsmen living between primitive modes of production and the emerging depression, the grim realities they face and the past events they recall, are full of stories of heroism and tragedy, startling and shocking real stories that could be made into excellent films. However, limited by the views and techniques of the producers, they either unrealistically seek plots from fantasies or emphasize the entanglements of men and women or the heroic deeds of individuals, resulting in the production of vulgar works that are either cliché or inaccurate.</p>
<p>This "Chivalrous Couple" is no exception. It writes about economic downturn, when farmers' livestock are unwanted. John (a livestock dealer), although willing to buy, is refused credit by the bank.</p>
<p>It would have been more commendable if the plot had unfolded with John proposing to the herdsmen to issue bonds first, and then pay cash after the livestock were sold in New Mexico, the herdsmen having no choice but to agree to these terms, and with John colluding with the governor to issue sales permits in advance, swallowing the money, and refusing to recognize the bonds.</p>
<p>But how did Alan Jain, the writer and director of "Chivalrous Couple," understand and handle the problems he captured from reality? He did not move towards the "peak" of the script from the life struggles of the vast group of herdsmen under this phenomenon, completing his masterpiece. He singled out "Gampton, who is naturally loyal and chivalrous, works on John's ranch, taking care of livestock and escorting them for sale," to desperately force John to pay the herdsmen the money they deserved for their livestock, for the herdsmen, and for his lover, Virginia.</p>
<p>Firstly, in terms of Gampton being naturally loyal, how could he turn against his master? The screen does not show a sufficient and appropriate process. Instead, it only shows "miraculous" strength, fighting against dozens of thugs, being invulnerable in a hail of bullets, exaggerating to the point of mythology with "leaping over the Tan Stream on horseback," crossing cliffs, wading through rivers, and hitting the mark every time with his returning gun. The coincidental and unrealistic performances, such as the enemies tying him to the door, letting him break down the door panel and fall out of the window onto two horses that carry him away, and John's repentance, have already elevated the entire play into the realm of fantasy. How could it bear another "riverbank romance" love tail, falling into the cliché of a mediocre and old-fashioned Happy Ending!</p>
<p>In terms of performance, generally speaking, it has not escaped the old-fashioned martial arts romance film. Some of the scenes depicting the lives of herdsmen have some merit, such as the natural scenery of tents in the wilderness, cattle herds, covered wagons, rivers, clouds and moon, wind and dust, and the primitive lifestyle are written in an extremely simple, soft, concise, and beautiful way. Several scenes of folk songs and dances are also adopted and handled quite adorably.</p>
<p>Apart from Ken Maynard, who plays Gampton, taking the stage with the banner of a martial arts star, showing off his fighting skills and horsemanship, William Gould, who plays the villainous merchant John, is relatively better. The expressions of the herdsmen's worries, anger, and joy, and the performance of the mob, show the director's efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Hopes for the New Year! <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Qin</p>
<p>I hope that all Chinese film magazines will stop their literary brawls and do their best to introduce domestic films, becoming faithful reporters.</p>
<p>I hope that entrepreneurs will discard their "business eyes" and produce some educational works for the sake of the nation and society.</p>
<p>I hope that directors will not be too arrogant, looking down on ordinary employees, while at the same time not putting effort into art themselves.</p>
<p>I hope that employees will conduct themselves with integrity and make the film industry bright and brilliant.</p>
<p>I hope that actresses will not do broadcasting, fashion shows, or become dancers, or...</p>
<p>I hope that Chinese people will watch more Chinese films and fewer foreign films.</p>

<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>After the local news editor left, Mitchell was about to look at a few other manuscripts when his secretary walked in, looking flustered, with a pale face, as if he had seen a ghost. He told Mitchell, "There's a man outside who wants to see you. His name is Dan Oliver. He won't say what he wants to see you about, but I... I... I think he looks quite fierce." Mitchell leaned back in his chair, his face suspicious and indecisive. After a moment, he resolutely said, "Tell him to come in!"</p>
<p>Dan Oliver came in. He was a small, thin man with gray hair, a face full of worry, revealing the fierce fire burning inside him, causing his eyes to sink and his cheekbones to protrude. Mitchell stared at him with wide eyes, feeling uneasy in his heart. He looked at Dan Oliver's hand inserted in his pocket. He thought if he would be so afraid. But he wasn't. His hand remained motionless opposite him. Mitchell then opened him up and said, "Do you want to see me?" The man said, "Are you the chief editor, Mr. Mitchell?" Mitchell said, "That's right, I am." The man said, "I am Dan Oliver. Your newspaper is going to publish a piece of news about me. I beg you not to publish it. Please give me a chance to repay the money I embezzled." His dry voice showed the anxiety in his heart. Mitchell slowly shook his head and said, "I'm sorry. It's too late now. You stole so much money, my readers should know about it." As Mitchell spoke, tears streamed from Dan Oliver's eyes. He shouted, "Just to satisfy the low desires of the general readership, you are going to tear a person's life to pieces like this?" Mitchell coldly said, "Why didn't you think about your life before you stole that money? I'm just providing my readers with true news." Oliver roared, "True news! True news! Do you know what true news is! You provide the general public with shallow knowledge with news of rape, adultery, and plunder, exaggerating and praising it every day. Now I have also become your sacrificial victim, just for you to have a large-font headline, to stir people's ears and eyes, you have cut off the path of my life." Mitchell sat in the big chair, pretending to be calm, and said, "Oliver, there's no need for us to discuss this issue any further."</p>
<p>Oliver's attitude suddenly became ferocious. He took a step forward, pointed the gun in his pocket at Mitchell, and said hatefully, "Okay! I'll give you another big headline—the biggest headline of the year. I'm standing here, waiting for your newspaper to be published. If my affair is published inside, I won't be human if I don't put a few holes in you!" Mitchell still leaned back in his chair without changing his expression. He looked very calmly at the person in front of him, but his brain was working rapidly. The person in front of him was a thug. He had come with determination, that was beyond doubt. But since he did not take drastic action, he still had time to adjust to him and fool him a little. At this time, Oliver was standing at the door, with his back to the open door. Mitchell waited quietly for the opportunity to reason with him again. But as soon as he glanced out of the door, his heart sank.</p>
<p>It turned out that his daughter Joan, wearing a new dress, walked in gracefully. As soon as she came in, she shouted, "Hello, Dad, give me some money." That was her usual state, like a spoiled young lady. She suddenly saw a stranger standing behind her. She was startled, and then said, "Oh, I'm sorry, I'll come back later." Oliver took out his gun and pointed it at her! "That's right. You wait. Wait here." Joan glanced at him, then walked gracefully behind her father and stood there. At this time, Mitchell's face turned even paler. Joan, his daughter, was also in a very dangerous situation with him. If this madman opened fire, wouldn't father and daughter die together? Suddenly, the phone on his desk rang. Mitchell looked at Oliver's face, as if asking him if he could answer it or not. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The construction project of Lianyungang is nearing completion. The foundation of the wharf is extremely solid. Since the start of berthing of ships on October 1st of last year, cargo transportation has been thriving day by day. The average monthly volume of cargo in and out exceeds 10,000 tons, all of which are local products from Jiangsu, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces. Currently, only one 3,000-ton seagoing vessel can be berthed. The remaining engineering works are still in progress. The entire dredging project is scheduled to be completed in the spring of this year, reliably providing berthing for eight ships. The Longhai Railway and China Merchants Bureau are handling water-land intermodal transport to complete the shipping development plan. It is planned to sail three routes: one from Lianyungang directly to Yunggand one from Shanghai directly to Guangzhou.</p>

In addition, Chinese schools are often closed on the pretext of minor matters related to the payment of goods. By the end of last year, more than 20 schools had been closed. The children of the 3 million overseas Chinese in this school will gradually forget their ancestral country. The situation is extremely critical. The fellow overseas Chinese hope that Mr. Chen will convey the suffering of the overseas Chinese in　　　　to the outside world in order to urge the motherland to find ways to provide relief.</p>

<p>Yang Wenqi, a recluse who collects coins from past dynasties, held an exhibition of Chinese coins from various dynasties at the Shanghai YMCA in Baxianqiao from the 29th to the 31st of last month. More than 5,000 types of ancient and modern coins were displayed. In terms of form, they were divided into knives, cloth, and springs.
